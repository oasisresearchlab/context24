Steven Bradford 1 Crowdfunding—the use of the Internet to raise money through small contributions from a large number of investors—may cause a revolution in small - business financing . Through crowdfunding , smaller entrepreneurs , who traditionally have had great difficulty obtaining capital , have access to anyone in the world with a computer , Internet access , and spare cash to invest . Crowdfunding sites such as Kiva , Kickstarter , and IndieGoGo have proliferated and the amount of money raised through crowdfunding has grown to billions of dollars in just a few years . Crowdfunding poses two issues under federal securities law . First , some , but not all , crowdfunding involves selling securities , triggering the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 . Registration is prohibitively expensive for the small offerings that crowdfunding facilitates , and none of the current exemptions from registration fit the crowdfunding model . Second , the web sites that facilitate crowdfunding may be treated as brokers or investment advisers under the ambiguous standards applied by the SEC . I consider the costs and benefits of crowdfunding and propose an exemption that would free crowdfunding from the regulatory requirements , but not the antifraud provisions , of the federal securities laws . Securities offerings of $ 250 , 000 or less would be exempted if ( 1 ) each investor invests no more than $ 250 or $ 500 a year and ( 2 ) the offering is made on an Internet crowdfunding site that meets the exemption’s requirements . Exempted offerings would be required to include a funding target and could not close until that target was met . Until then , investors would be free to withdraw . To qualify for the exemption , crowdfunding sites must ( 1 ) be open to the general public ; ( 2 ) provide public communication portals for investors and potential investors ; ( 3 ) require investors to fulfill a simple education requirement before participating ; ( 4 ) prohibit certain conflicts of interest ; ( 5 ) not offer investment advice or recommendations ; and ( 6 ) notify the SEC that they are hosting crowdfunding offerings . Sites that meet these requirements would not be treated as brokers or investment advisers . 1 Earl Dunlap Distinguished Professor of Law , University of Nebraska - Lincoln College of Law .

Introduction Small businesses , especially startups , have a difficult time raising money . The usual sources of business finance—bank lending , venture capital , retained earnings—are not available to small and micro - businesses . Wealthy individuals known as angel investors fill part of the funding gap , but angel investing is limited and even angel investors tend to 4 focus on larger investments . Entrepreneurs who lack the personal resources needed to finance their businesses turn to friends , family members , and personal acquaintances , but those sources are often insufficient . As a result , many potentially successful small businesses do not get funded . A possible solution to the small business funding gap , crowdfunding , has emerged in the last few years . Crowdfunding , sometimes called peer - to - peer lending when it involves debt financing , is , as its name indicates , funding from the crowd—raising small amounts of money from a large number of investors . Unlike more typical business financing , which usually comes from wealthy individuals and institutional investors , crowdfunding comes from the general public . In times past , the transaction costs associated with raising small amounts from a large number of investors would have made crowdfunding unworkable , but the Internet has significantly reduced , almost eliminated , those transaction costs . Crowdfunding web sites , such as Kickstarter , Lending Club , Prosper , ProFounder , IndieGoGo , and , the paragon of crowdfunding , 2 Kiva , have proliferated . Through these sites , entrepreneurs have access to anyone in the world with a computer , Internet access , and free cash . Billions of dollars have been raised through crowdfunding , possibly the beginning of a revolution in how we allocate capital . 3 The power of crowdfunding is illustrated by a recent campaign by two ad executives , Michael Migliozzi II and Brian William Flatow , to raise $ 300 million to buy Pabst Brewing . 4 They promised investors “certificates of ownership” and beer with a value equal to the amount invested . 5 According to their lawyer , the two were only conducting an online experiment and never actually intended to buy Pabst , 6 but they reportedly received $ 200 million in pledges from over five million people in the six - month period before the SEC shut them down . 7 Unfortunately , as this example illustrates , crowdfunding does not mesh with federal securities regulation . Entrepreneurs seeking debt or equity financing through crowdfunding will often be selling securities , and offerings of securities must be registered under the Securities Act unless an exemption is available . Registration of crowdfunding offerings would be prohibitively expensive . A couple of peer - to - peer lending sites have registered their offerings , but , to do so , they had to substantially restructure how crowdfunding works , and that restructuring is unlikely to work for equity offerings . The current exemptions from the registration requirement also do not fit crowdfunding well . Some crowdfunding sites have tried to fit within these exemptions , 2 Jeff Howe , CROWDSOURCING : WHY THE POWER OF THE CROWD IS DRIVING THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS 247 ( 2008 ) . 3 See Kevin Lawton & Dan Marom , THE CROWDFUNDING REVOLUTION : SOCIAL NETWORKING MEETS VENTURE FINANCING 3 ( 2010 ) ( “in the same way that social networking changed how we allocate our time , crowdfunding will change how we allocate capital” ) . 4 Chad Bray , Huge Beer Run Halted by Those No Fun D .

These restrictions eliminate the power of crowdfunding , access to the public crowd of small investors . Securities - based crowdfunding is practicable only if a new exemption is created . Several proposals have been presented to exempt crowdfunding and certain other small business securities offerings from the registration requirements of the Securities Act . One proposal would exempt offerings of up to $ 100 , 000 , provided that no single investor contributed more than $ 100 . Another would exempt offerings of up to $ 1 million , with a maximum per individual investor of either $ 10 , 000 or ten percent of the investor’s income in the prior year . A third proposal would exempt offerings of up to $ 1 million , with a maximum per investor of $ 10 , 000 . Most recently , Joan Heminway and Shelden Hoffman have outlined several possible features of a crowdfunding exemption . 8 Their proposed exemption would also limit the offering amount and cap the amount invested by non - accredited , unsophisticated investors . 9 But the Securities Act’s registration requirement is not the only potential obstacle to crowdfunding . The web sites that facilitate crowdfunding face their own regulatory issues . If crowdfunding entrepreneurs offer securities on these sites , the sites could be acting as unregistered brokers or investment advisers under opaque SEC standards . Any proposal designed to facilitate crowdfunding must deal with these issues as well . The Dodd - Frank Act requires the General Accounting Office to study peer - to - peer lending 10 and the SEC has promised to look at crowdfunding as part of a general review of regulatory constraints on capital formation . According to one source , crowdfunding sites are “gearing up for a boom” if the SEC eases its rules . 11 The CEO of one crowdfunding site , ProFounder , indicated in May 2011 that she was already “working with a legal team to lay the groundwork for online equity sales . ” 12 These efforts are probably premature . The SEC often moves at a glacial pace when it comes to reform , and it has a dubious history with respect to proposals to facilitate small business financing . I argue for an exemption that would free both crowdfunded offerings and the web sites on which they are made from federal securities regulation . Under the exemption , the total dollar amount of an entrepreneur’s offerings should be limited to around $ 250 , 000 a year , with individual investors limited to $ 250 to $ 500 a year . Investors would have to satisfy a very limited education requirement before investing and offerings could be closed only if the entrepreneur met his pre - established fundraising goal . The offerings would also have 8 See Joan MacLeod Heminway and Shelden Ryan Hoffman , Proceed at Your Peril : Crowdfunding and the Securities Act of 1933 ( June 30 , 2011 ) , available at http : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 1875584 . 9 See id . , at 60 . 10 Dodd - Frank Act , Pub .

The CEO of IndieGoGo , a crowdfunding site , indicated that a regulatory change would “significantly boost activity” on her site . Id . 12 Angus Loten , supra note 11 . 6 to be made on publicly accessible crowdfunding web sites that , among other things , meet conflict - of - interest standards and do not provide investment advice . Section II of the article is an introduction to the crowdfunding phenomenon . I define crowdfunding and briefly explore its precursors , crowdsourcing and micro - finance . I also distinguish among five different models of crowdfunding : the donation model ; the reward model ; the pre - purchase model ; the lending model , sometimes called peer - to - peer lending ; and the equity model . The difference among the five models relates to what , if anything , contributors are promised in return for their contributions . In Section III , I discuss whether crowdfunding investments are securities subject to the Securities Act registration requirements . I conclude that the answer depends on the particular form of crowdfunding . Crowdfunding contributions on donation , reward , and pre - purchase sites are not securities . Crowdfunding investments on equity sites would be securities in the usual case where if investors are promised some investment return other than the return of their capital . The answer with respect to lending sites is a little less certain . If investors are promised interest on their loans , those investments are probably securities . If no interest is offered , lending sites would not be offering securities . In Section IV , I discuss the regulatory issues posed by crowdfunding sites . Even if crowdfunded offerings are exempted from registration , the web sites that facilitate crowdfunding could still be in violation of federal securities laws . They might be acting as unregistered brokers , investment advisers , or , less likely , exchanges . Section V discusses the various proposals to exempt crowdfunding from federal securities law , and the SEC’s reaction to those proposals . I also briefly examine the SEC’s authority to exempt crowdfunding and conclude that a crowdfunding exemption such as those proposed would fall within that authority . In Section VI , I address the benefits and costs of crowdfunding . Crowdfunding would help ease the capital gap faced by start - ups and very small businesses . It would extend the geographical reach of small - business fundraising and make capital available to poorer entrepreneurs whose family , friends , and acquaintances have insufficient funds . But these gains come at a potential cost . Crowdfunding exposes relatively unsophisticated investors to the greater risks associated with small business offerings—illiquidity , increased risks of fraud and business failure , and the risk of entrepreneurial self - dealing . Properly structured , crowdfunding may reduce those risks to some extent , but certainly not completely . However , investors are already exposed to those same risks in the existing , non - securities models of crowdfunding . A crowdfunding securities exemption could make them better off by increasing their potential gains . Section VII considers what a crowdfunding exemption should look like . I set out several limits on both crowdfunded offerings and the sites on which they are made and explain why those limits would be appropriate . 7 II . An Introduction to Crowdfunding A . What Is Crowdfunding ? The basic idea of crowdfunding is to raise money through relatively small contributions from a large number of people . 13 Crowdfunding can be used for non - business purposes , but this article focuses only on crowdfunding as a way for a business to raise money . In that context , an entrepreneur publishes a request for funding on a crowdfunding web site . The request describes what the entrepreneur intends to do with the money—the proposed product and a business plan . It also indicates what , if anything , people who contribute money to finance the business will receive in return—a share of the profits , interest , the product , some other reward , or nothing at all . Investors browse through entrepreneurs’ listings and , if they find one ( or more ) that interests them , they can contribute anything from a few dollars to the total amount the entrepreneur is seeking . The web site on which the funding request is published typically facilitates the exchange of funds—the initial contributions from the investors to the entrepreneurs and , if investors are to receive money back , the payments from the entrepreneur back to the investors . Business - related crowdfunding is , in effect , mass capitalism . It opens the world of entrepreneurship to anyone who can convince enough other people that he has an idea worth funding . And it opens the world of investment to anyone with a few dollars to spend . Crowdfunding offerings are typically rather small . One study found that the median amount raised was only $ 28 , 583 . 14 The mean was $ 3 . 5 million . 15 But crowdfunding isn’t necessarily limited to very small offerings . The largest amount raised in that same study was $ 82 . 1 million . 16 Internet - based crowdfunding is relatively new . Kiva , the leading crowdfunding site today , did not open for business until 2005 , 17 and the term “crowdfunding” did not appear until 2006 . 18 But the basic concept is not new . Politicians have been raising campaign funds through crowdfunding for generations , 19 although it wasn’t called that . The Internet , allowing inexpensive mass appeals to almost everyone , has driven crowdfunding’s phenomenal growth . 20 Using the Internet , an entrepreneur can “in real 13 See Paul Belleflamme , Thomas Lambert , and Armin Schwienbacher , Crowdfunding : Tapping the Right Crowd , 2 ( Jan . 24 , 2011 ) , available at : http : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 1836873 . 14 Belleflamme , et al . , supra note 13 , at Table 2 , 32 , 33 . . 15 Id . , at Table 2 , 32 - 33 . 16 Id . , at Table 2 , 32 .

[ sell ] . . . to literally millions of potential investors . ” 21 No intermediary , such as a bank or an underwriter , is needed . 22 As a result , crowdfunding “is becoming a big business , with a steady parade of services joining the fray . ” 23 One crowdfunding site , Kiva , is so popular that it sometimes exhausts its available lending opportunities , resulting in “check back later” signs on its web site . 24 As of late July 2011 , over 600 , 000 different Kiva lenders had loaned over $ 225 million dollars to almost 600 , 000 entrepreneurs . 25 Peer - to - peer lending , just one form of crowdfunding , has alone been responsible for over a billion dollars in funding , and some industry analysts believe peer - to - peer lending could exceed $ 5 billion annually by 2013 . 26 Crowdfunding has been especially popular in the entertainment industry , 27 but there are crowdfunding sites for all types of projects . Some crowdfunding sites are limited to specific businesses or types of projects , such as book publishing , 28 gaming , 29 music , 30 journalism , 31 or agriculture and ranching . 32 Crowdfunding is even being used to fund scientists’ research projects . 33 Other sites limit themselves to broader categories , such as 21 Stuart R .

In this article , I focus on the issues posed by domestic crowdfunding sites—web sites operated by U . S . companies that bring together U . S . entrepreneurs and U . S . investors . 49 B . Types of Crowdfunding One can loosely categorize crowdfunding into five types , distinguished by what contributors receive in return for their contributions : ( 1 ) the donation model ; ( 2 ) the reward model ; ( 3 ) the pre - purchase model ; ( 4 ) the lending model ; and ( 5 ) the equity model . Some sites encompass more than one model ; it is especially common to see the reward and pre - purchase models on a single web site . Other sites rely on only a single model . 1 . Donation Sites The contributions on donation sites are , as the name would indicate , donations . Contributors receive nothing in return for their contribution , not even a return of the principal amount contributed . However , although the contributor’s motive is charitable , the recipient’s need not be . A donation might fund a for - profit enterprise . Pure donation sites are rare , and those that exist focus on request by charities and other non - profit institutions , rather than businesses . 50 However , some of the reward and pre - purchase sites also allow unrewarded requests for donations , although rewards are encouraged . 51 One study found that only 22 % of all crowdfunding initiatives were requests for donations , with no rewards offered . 52 GlobalGiving is an example of a pure donation model site . 53 It allows donors to direct contributions to development projects around the world . 54 The GlobalGiving Foundation , which operates the site , takes a 15 % fee , 55 and guarantees that the remainder of the donation will reach the project within 60 days . 56 However , GlobalGiving , like other pure 48 See generally THOMAS LEE HAZEN , 6 TREATISE ON THE LAW OF SECURITIES REGULATION 403 - 421 ( 6TH ED . 2009 ) . The answers to these questions are complicated by the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Morrison v . National Australian Bank Ltd . , - - - U . S . - - - , 130 S . Ct . 2869 ( 2010 ) . 49 I will , however , use both domestic and non - domestic crowdfunding sites without distinction to illustrate particular issues and modes of operation . 50 See , e . g . , GLOBALGIVING , http : / / www . globalgiving . org / ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) ; DONORSCHOOSE .

Reward and Pre - Purchase Sites The reward and pre - purchase crowdfunding models are similar , and tend to appear together on the same sites . The reward model offers something to the investor in return for the contribution , but not interest or a part of the earnings of the business . The reward could be small , such as a key chain , or it could be something with a little more cachet , such as the investor’s name on the credits of a movie . 58 The pre - purchase model is the most common type of crowdfunding . 59 It is similar to the reward model , but common enough to deserve its own category . As with the reward model , contributors do not receive a financial return—interest , dividends , or part of the earnings of a business . Instead , they receive the product that the entrepreneur is making . For example , if the entrepreneur is producing a music album , contributors would receive the album , or the right to buy the album at a reduced price , upon completion . Among other things , the pre - purchase model gives entrepreneurs an opportunity to engage in price discrimination , and capture more profits , by offering an enhanced experience to early adopters . 60 Kickstarter 61 and IndieGoGo 62 are the leading reward / pre - purchase crowdfunding sites . 63 The two sites are similar . Kickstarter requires its projects to offer what it calls “rewards , ” 64 and , according to Kickstarter , rewards are typically of the pre - purchase variety : “Rewards are typically items produced by the project itself — a copy of the CD , a print from the show , a limited edition of the comic . ” 65 Typically , the “donation” required to receive the product is below the planned retail price . For example , Dan Provost and Tom Gerhardt , who designed a tripod mount for the iPhone , offered one of the mounts to anyone who donated $ 20 . 66 They planned to sell the mount for a retail 57 See GlobalGiving is Always Looking for More Incredible Grassroots Projects , GLOBALGIVING , http : / / www . globalgiving . org / non - profits / join - globalgiving / ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) . 58 See , e . g . , Kappel , supra note 27 , at 376 ( 2009 ) ( patrons receive perks “such as the use of their name in the film credits or album liner notes , advanced autographed copies of the work , or backstage access at a performer’s show . ” ) 59 Belleflamme , et al , supra note 13 , at Table 3 , 34 - 35 ( 66 . 7 % of crowdfunding offerings not involving pure donations offered the right to receive a product ) . 60 Belleflamme , et al . , supra note 13 , at 14 . 61 Kickstarter : A New Way to Fund & Follow Creativity , KICKSTARTER , http : / / www . kickstarter . com / ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) . 62 IndieGoGo : The World’s Leading International Funding Platform , INDIEGOGO , http : / / www . indiegogo . com / ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) . 63 There are a number of other rewards / pre - purchase sites .

Lending Sites ( Peer - to - Peer Lending ) The lending model of crowdfunding is often called peer - to - peer lending . Peer - to - peer lending involves , as the name indicates , a loan . Contributors are only providing the funds temporarily and repayment is expected . In some cases , investors receive interest on the funds they loan . In other cases , they receive only their principal back . a . Sites Not Offering Interest Kiva is , without a doubt , the leading crowdfunding site using the lending model , 79 and probably the leading crowdfunding site of any type . One source calls Kiva “the hottest nonprofit on the planet . ” 80 Kiva was originally not open to entrepreneurs in the United States , but it changed that policy in 2009 . 81 Kiva does not lend directly to entrepreneurs , but instead partners with microfinance lenders around the world , which Kiva calls “field partners . ” 82 The local institutions make loans to entrepreneurs , often before the loan request is even posted on Kiva . 83 Each entrepreneur’s loan request is posted on the Kiva web site , where potential lenders can browse the requests and fund each one in any amount from $ 25 to the full amount of the loan . 84 Kiva collects and distributes this money back to the field partners , and credits lenders with any repayments the entrepreneurs make . 85 Lenders on the Kiva site only get their principal back ; the field partners use any interest received to cover their operating costs . 86 b . Sites Offering Interest Prosper and Lending Club are the two leading lending sites that offer interest . 87 Not all of the loans on these sites are used for business purposes ; most of the loans are used to pay 79 See http : / / www . kiva . org / . Another example of a lending site that does not charge interest is Inuka , which is limited to requests from female entrepreneurs .

Lending Club evaluates each borrower and sets an interest rate on each loan based on the “loan grade” it assigns to the loan . 103 Prosper also rates each potential loan , 104 but those scores are used only to set a minimum rate for the loans . 105 The actual interest rate is determined by an auction process . Each lender bids the minimum percentage he is willing to accept , 106 and the interest rate on each loan ( and on the notes issued by Prosper ) is the minimum percentage acceptable to sufficient lenders to fund the amount of the loan . 107 4 . Equity Sites The equity model gives contributors an interest in the profits or return of the business they are helping to fund . The equity model is the one that most clearly involves the sale of a security , and , because of the regulatory issues that involves , the equity crowdfunding model is not common in the United States . Equity crowdfunding is more common elsewhere ; one study found that one - third of all the crowdfunding offerings that offered any sort of reward to investors offered stock . 108 Until recently , the leading equity - model crowdfunding site in the U . S . was ProFounder . 109 However , ProFounder announced in June of 2011 , that it would no longer be offering securities on its site . 110 It is unclear why they did this ; Jessica Jackley , 98 Prosper Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 5 ; Lending Club Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 6 . 99 Prosper Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 8 ; Lending Club Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 7 . 100 Prosper Registration Statement , supra note 92 - , at 8 ; Lending Club Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 4 , 7 - 8 .

In public raises , the amount paid back to investors was limited to the amount they invested , with no additional return for the use of their money ; investors in private raises could receive more than what they invested . 115 Public raises were open to the general public ; private raises were limited to friends , family members and existing acquaintances of each entrepreneur , an attempt to fit within the SEC’s Rule 504 exemption from registration . 116 Entrepreneurs on ProFounder offered investors a percentage of the gross revenues of their business—as ProFounder described it , “basically . . . all of the money coming in to your business , before you take anything out for expenses . ” 117 The exact percentage of revenues to be paid to investors and the period over which investors were to receive those funds was determined by the individual entrepreneur , 118 but the maximum payout period was five years . 119 This share of revenues was the only equity interest investors received . They did not receive stock or any other ownership interest in the entrepreneur’s business . 120 Entrepreneurs had to pay to list on ProFounder , but the amount and structure of those payments is a little unclear . According to the ProFounder web site , entrepreneurs had to pay an initial fee of $ 100 to post a fundraising appeal . 121 But , according to ProFounder’s 111 The Team , PROFOUNDER , http : / / www . profounder . com / about / team ( last visited July 11 , 2011 ) . 112 “We ' re still very much in start - up mode ( just 6 months post - launch ) and we are constantly testing and learning .

If the fundraising was a public raise , the entrepreneur had to pay 5 % of the amount raised if the fundraising was successful . 123 If the fundraising was a private raise , both the ProFounder web site and one interview of its CEO indicated that the entrepreneur had to pay an additional $ 1 , 000 . 124 But the CEO indicated in another interview that no additional fee was charged for a private raise—that entrepreneurs paid a flat $ 1 , 000 fee , whether or not the offering was successful . 125 Entrepreneurs had thirty days to raise the funds needed . 126 If entrepreneurs failed to reach their goal , they received none of the pledged funds . 127 Investors did not sign a term sheet or make any payments until the goal was met .

For example , since 1900 , the National Audubon Society has been organizing bird - watchers to do an annual count of birds in the Western hemisphere . 134 And the famous Pillsbury Bake - Off is a long - standing means of crowd - sourcing recipes . 135 The rise of the Internet , however , is making crowdsourcing ubiquitous ; the Internet significantly reduces the transaction costs of decentralized group action 136 and “opens . . . the economy to new Linux - like projects every day . ” 137 The “rigid institutional structures” previously required to organize economic action are , in many cases , no longer necessary . 138 Astronomy ; stock photography ; prediction markets ; eBay—platforms based on the collective contributions of a large number of people are commonplace today . 139 Even the all - pervasive Google search system is crowdsourcing ; Google’s algorithm captures the sites that all of us collectively are linking to and visiting . 140 The other antecedent of crowdfunding is micro - lending , sometimes called microfinance . Micro - lending can be traced back to Irish loan funds in the 1700s , 141 but it became prominent in recent times through the work in Bangladesh of Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank . 142 Yunus’s project began when he loaned $ 27 of his own money to 42 villagers in Bangladesh . 143 He subsequently established a multi - branch bank , the Grameen Bank , that specialized in such loans . 144 In 2006 , Yunus and the Grameen Bank shared the Nobel Peace Prize .

Crowdsourcing is defined primarily by the contributor—small contributions from a large number of people to achieve a common goal . Crowdfunding is just a combination of those two - - small contributions from a large number of people to fund small entrepreneurial ventures . III . Are Crowdfunding Investments Subject to the Registration Requirements of the Securities Act ? Fundraising on crowdfunding sites raises two different sets of issues under federal securities laws . The first issue relates to the offerings themselves : are the entrepreneurs raising funds offering securities subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 ? The second set of issues relates to possible violations of securities law by the crowdfunding sites which facilitate those offerings . I address the first issue in this section ; the next section focuses on the securities law status of the crowdfunding sites . Section 5 of the Securities Act and the SEC rules associated with section 5 are a morass of prohibitions , exceptions , conditions , and exceptions to exceptions , 148 but the basic prohibitions are clear . Absent an exemption , an issuer may not offer a security for sale until a registration statement has been filed with the SEC . 149 And an issuer may not sell a security 150 until that registration statement has become effective . 151 But the registration requirements apply only if the entrepreneurs on crowdfunding sites are offering customers use the services with varying degrees of intensity . ” ) . For a discussion of the difficulty of measuring the impact of microfinance , see id . , at 199 - 224 . 146 See Kathleen Kingsbury , supra note 142 ( noting complaints that microcredit does little to alleviate overall poverty , crowds out locally owned banks , and can leave the poor drowning in debt ) . 147 See Kingsbury , supra note 142 ( as of 2007 , about 10 , 000 microfinance institutions held more than $ 7 billion in outstanding loans ) . 148 Consider , for example , Securities Act Rule 433 . Whether a communication falls within the Rule 433 safe harbor can depend on , among other things : ( 1 ) whether the issuer has filed a registration statement , Rule 433 ( a ) ; ( 2 ) characteristics of the company issuing the securities , such as its size and how long it has been a reporting company , Rule 433 ( b ) ; ( 3 ) the content of the communication , Rule 433 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( i ) , ( c ) ; ( 4 ) who is making the communication , Rule 433 ( d ) , ( f ) ; ( 5 ) where the information in the communication originally came from , Rule 433 ( d ) ( 1 ) ( i ) ( B ) , ( h ) ( 2 ) ; ( 6 ) whether the information in the communication is otherwise available to the general public , Rule 433 ( d ) ( 8 ) ( ii ) ; and ( 7 ) whether the issuer or anyone else associated with the offering paid for the communication , Rule 433 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( i ) , ( f ) ( 1 ) ( i ) . 149 Securities Act § 5 ( c ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77e ( c ) ( 2010 ) . 150 “Selling” includes entering into a contract of sale . See Securities Act § 2 ( a ) ( 3 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77b ( a ) ( 3 ) ( 2010 ) . 151 Securities Act § 5 ( a ) ( 1 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77e ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2010 ) . 21 securities . 152 If crowdfunding investments are not securities , the federal securities laws do not apply . A . Are Crowdfunding Investments Securities ? Each federal securities statute has its own definition of “security , ” but the language of the various definitions , at least as to the issues raised here , is roughly identical . 153 The most expansive part of the definition of security , the catch - all category , is the term “investment contract . ” The Supreme Court’s Howey case defined an investment contract as ( 1 ) an investment of money ( 2 ) in a common enterprise ( 3 ) with an expectation of profits ( 4 ) arising solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party . 154 Both the Supreme Court and the lower courts have refined the Howey test over the years , but its basic elements remain unchanged , with one significant exception . The word “solely” has been eliminated from the efforts - of - others part of the test . Instead , the question is “whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones , those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise . ” 155 Crowdfunding offerings of the donation , reward , and pre - purchase type clearly do not involve securities for purposes of federal law . Crowdfunding sites organized on the lending model probably are offering securities if the lender is promised interest and crowdfunding sites organized on the equity model are usually offering securities . 156 1 . The Donation Model Donation - model crowdfunding sites are not offering securities to investors . Contributors receive absolutely nothing in return for their contributions , so they clearly have no expectation of profits , a requirement for something to be an investment contract under Howey . And contributors to donation - model sites are offered nothing else , such as stock 157 or notes , 158 that falls within the general definition of security . 159 Gratuitous contributions , even to a business entity , simply are not securities . 152 Even if they are offering securities , an exemption may be available . See section III . B . 2 , infra . 153 See Securities Act § 2 ( a ) ( 1 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77b ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2010 ) ; Securities Exchange Act § 3 ( a ) ( 10 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 78c ( a ) ( 10 ) ( 2010 ) ; Investment Company Act § 2 ( a ) ( 36 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 80a - 2 ( a ) ( 36 ) ( 2010 ) ; Investment Advisers Act § 202 ( a ) ( 18 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 80b - 2 ( a ) ( 18 ) ( 2010 ) . For convenience , I will generally refer to the Securities Act definition unless there is some relevant difference . 154 SEC v . W . J . Howey Co . , 328 U . S . 293 , 298 ( 1946 ) . 155 SEC v . Glenn W . Turner Enterprises , Inc . , 474 F . 2d 476 , 482 ( 9th Cir . 1973 ) . Accord , SEC v . Koscot Interplanetary , Inc . , 497 F . 2d 473 , 483 ( 5th Cir . 1974 ) . 156 Heminway and Hoffman have also concluded that at least some crowdfunding offerings are securities under the Howey investment contract test . See Heminway and Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 10 - 24 . 157 See Landreth Timber Co . , v . Landreth , 471 U . S . 681 ( 1985 ) ( holding that ordinary corporate stock is a security ) . 158 See Reves v . Ernst & Young , 494 U . S . 56 ( 1990 ) ( applying the “family resemblance” test to determine whether a note is a security ) . 159 Securities Act § 2 ( a ) ( 1 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77b ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2010 ) . 22 2 . The Reward and Pre - purchase Models The reward and pre - purchase models also do not involve securities under federal law , as long as the reward or the pre - purchased product is all the investor is promised in return for his or her contribution . The Supreme Court has drawn a clear distinction between investment and consumption . An investment contract is present only when an investor is offered a financial return on his investment , such as capital appreciation or a participation in earnings 160 or even a fixed rate of interest . 161 If “a purchaser is motivated by a desire to use or consume the item purchased . . . the securities laws do not apply . ” 162 It does not matter that the contributed is promised a lower price for the product than the general public will pay . Contributors on reward or pre - purchase sites are offered no financial return of any kind . Their contribution earns them only some product or service—a consumption item . Because one of the elements of the Howey test is clearly not met , no investment contract is being offered . And , because investors on reward or pre - purchase sites are not offered stock , notes , or anything else that falls within the definition of security , no security is present . 3 . The Equity Model Equity - model crowdfunding would usually involve securities . If investors receive ordinary corporate stock in exchange for their contributions , they clearly are purchasing securities . The definition of security includes “stock , ” 163 and the Supreme Court has held that ordinary corporate stock is a security , with no additional analysis required . 164 But , even if crowdfunding investors receive some equity interest other than stock , those equity investments would still be securities . Interests in partnerships and limited liability companies , and other non - stock equity interests are usually analyzed under the Howey investment contract test . 165 The interests offered to investors on equity - model sites would clearly be investment contracts under Howey . Crowdfunding almost by definition involves a common enterprise among many different investors .

Some states use a risk capital test to define securities . The risk capital test has three elements : “ ( 1 ) an investment , ( 2 ) in the risk capital of an enterprise , and ( 3 ) the expectation of a benefit . Joseph C . Long , 12 BLUE SKY LAW 2 - 135 ( 2011 ) . The benefit expected need not be an interest in profits , but can be any benefit that motivates the investor to invest .

C . § 77b ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2010 ) . 164 Although calling something stock is not alone enough to make it a security , United Housing Foundation , Inc . v . Forman , 421 U . S . 837 , 848 ( 1975 ) , “ [ i ] instruments that bear both the name and all of the usual characteristics of stock seem to us to be the clearest case for coverage by the plain language of the definition . ” Landreth Timber Co . v . Landreth , 471 U . S . 681 , 693 ( 1985 ) . 165 See , e . g . , United States v . Leonard , 529 F . 3D 83 ( 2d Cir . 2008 ) ( LLCs ) ; Williamson v . Tucker , 645 F . 2d 404 ( 5th Cir . 1981 ) ( partnerships ) . 23 number of different investors . The business pools these investors’ funds and the investors share in the returns of the business . Although there is some disagreement among the lower courts about what exactly constitutes a common enterprise , all courts agree that horizontal commonality of this sort meets the Howey test . 166 Investors on equity - model sites would also have an expectation of profits . Contributors are providing cash in return for some sort of revenue or profit sharing . 167 The “public raise” type of funding offered by ProFounder 168 would not meet this requirement , however . Public - raise investors are promised a share of the entrepreneur’s revenues , but only until their original contribution is repaid . A person who contributed $ 1 , 000 would receive , at most , only $ 1 , 000 back , no matter how well the business did . Since no profits are expected , public - raise investments would not be securities . Finally , the profits expected are to come solely from the efforts of the promoters or other third parties . Crowdfunding investors will not usually be involved in the operation of the business in which they invest and , even if the crowdfunding site allows them some minor role , the “essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise” 169 will be those of the entrepreneur . 4 . The Lending Model The analysis is most complicated for lending - model crowdfunding . 170 The federal securities laws are not limited to equity interests in businesses ; the definition of security clearly encompasses some forms of debt 171 and an investment may be a security even though the return consists of a fixed payment or a fixed rate of interest . 172 Howey is still relevant , but , if investors are offered notes , the Supreme Court’s analysis in Reves v . Ernst & Young must also be considered . Sites like Kiva that offer investors no interest or other return , only a return of their principal , are probably not offering securities , but , if investors are promised interest , their investments probably are securities . Consider first whether crowdfunding sites offering interest are selling investment contracts . Contributors are investing money with an expectation of profits . A fixed rate of interest , such as what is offered on the Lending Club and Prosper sites , would be “profit” 166 See 1 HAZEN , supra note 48 , at 98 ( “Horizontal commonality clearly satisfies the Howey common enterprise requirement” ) . 167 Even if investors are offered a fixed return , rather than one that depends on how well the business does , that would still meet the Howey requirement of an expectation of profits . See SEC v . Edwards , 540 U . S . 389 ( 2004 ) ( holding that an agreement to pay investors $ 82 a month constituted a security ) . 168 See text accompanying notes 114 - 116 , supra . 169 SEC v . Glenn W . Turner Enterprises , Inc . , 474 F . 2d 476 , 482 ( 9th Cir . 1973 ) . 170 Many lending sites offer consumer loans , and not just loans to business entrepreneurs . The following discussion is limited to loans to businesses and business projects . Loans for consumer purposes are less likely to be treated as securities . See Verstein , supra note 22 , at 22 , 23 - 24 ( arguing that consumer notes would not be securities under either the Howey or Reves tests ) . 171 The definition of security includes , among other things , “notes” , “bonds” , “debentures” , and “evidence of indebtedness . ” See Securities Act § 2 ( a ) ( 1 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77b ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2010 ) . 172 SEC v . Edwards , 540 U . S . 389 ( 2004 ) ( holding that an investment offering a fixed return of $ 82 a month was an investment contract ) . 24 for purposes of Howey . 173 There is a horizontal common enterprise , assuming that more than one lender contributes to each business . And the profits are going to result solely , or at least primarily , from the efforts of the entrepreneur . Thus , investments made on lending sites that offer investors interest would be investment contracts under the Howey test . However , if the site , like Kiva , offers investors only a return of their principal , without any interest or other gain , investors would have no expectation of profits , 174 and , because of that , the investment contract test would not be met . Investments made through lending - model sites might also involve notes , and thus be securities under another part of the definition . 175 Some of the lending sites , such as Kiva , do not give investors a formal note in return for their investments ; others , such as Lending Club and Prosper , do . The term “note” appears in the definition of security , 176 but not all notes are securities . The Supreme Court applies a different analysis , first articulated in Reves v . Ernst & Young , 177 to determine whether a note is a security . The Reves analysis , known as the family resemblance test , begins with a rebuttable presumption that every note is a security . 178 It then applies a list of notes that are not securities , but crowdfunding loans to businesses would not fit any of the categories on that list . 179 We therefore must move to the final step of the Reves analysis : applying a four - part test to determine whether crowdfunding notes bear sufficient family resemblance to the listed non - securities that crowdfunding notes should also not be treated as securities . In applying this test , it is important to keep in mind that the presumption is in favor of treating notes as securities . 173 Id . 174 See Verstein , supra note 22 , at 41 ( agreeing with this analysis ) . This is why Kiva does not offer interest to investors . According to Matt Flannery , a co - founder of Kiva , Kiva would like to offer investors interest . Matt Flannery , Kiva and the Birth of Person - to - Person Microfinance , 2 INNOVATIONS ( Nos . 1 - 2 ) 31 , 53 ( Winter / Spring 2007 ) . They decided not to after he had a conversation with an attorney in the SEC’s Office of Small Business Policy and concluded that the key to avoiding SEC interference was not to offer interest . Id . , at 41 . 175 When an instrument is a note , the applicability of the Howey investment contract analysis is a little unclear . Most courts have applied the Howey investment contract test and the Reves note test in the alternative with little analysis . See , e . g . , SEC v . U . S . Reservation Bank & Trust , 289 Fed . Appx . 228 , 230 - 31 ( 9th Cir . 2008 ) ; Resolution Trust Corp . v . Stone , 998 F . 2d 1534 , 1539 ( 10th Cir . 1993 ) ; SEC v . Novus Technologies , LLC , 2010 WL 4180550 ( D . Utah Oct . 20 , 2010 ) ; In Re Tucker Freight Lines , Inc . , 789 F . Supp . 884 , 888 - 889 ( W . D . Mich . 1991 ) ; Reeder v . Succession of Palmer , 736 F . Supp . 128 , 131 - 132 ( E . D . La . 1990 ) . See also Dennis S . Corgill , Securities as Investments at Risk , 67 TUL . L . REV . 861 , 900 ( 1993 ) ( concluding that a note that is not a security under the Reves test could still be a security under the Howey investment contract test ) . But see Robert Anderson IV , Employee Incentives and the Federal Securities Laws , 57 U . MIAMI L . REV . 1195 , 1231 ( 2003 ) ( arguing against applying a second - stage investment contract analysis to something that is not a security under Reves ) . 176 See Securities Act § 2 ( a ) ( 1 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77b ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2010 ) . 177 494 U . S . 56 ( 1990 ) . 178 Id . , at 63 . 179 Reves accepted the following categories of non - securities : “the note delivered in consumer financing , the note secured by a mortgage on a home , the short - term note secured by a lien on a small business or some of its assets , the note evidencing a ‘character’ loan to a bank customer , short - term notes secured by an assignment of accounts receivable , . . . a note which simply formalizes an open - account debt incurred in the ordinary course of business ( particularly if , as in the case of the customer of a broker , it is collateralized ) , . . . [ and ] . . . notes evidencing loans by commercial banks for current operations . ” Id . , at 65 . 25 The four factors are ( 1 ) the motivations of the buyer and seller of the note ; ( 2 ) the plan of distribution of the notes ; ( 3 ) the reasonable expectations of the investing public ; and ( 4 ) “whether some factor such as the existence of another regulatory scheme significantly reduces the risk of the instrument , thereby rendering application of the securities Acts unnecessary . ” 180 We can dismiss the last factor immediately . Crowdfunding loans , like the notes at issue in Reves , are uncollateralized and uninsured , and no other federal regulatory scheme covers them . They “would escape federal regulation entirely if the . . . [ federal securities laws ] . . . were held not to apply . ” 181 The motivations factor clearly supports treating interest - bearing crowdfunding notes as securities . The entrepreneur’s purpose , or in the case of sites like Lending Club and Prosper that issue their own notes to finance entrepreneurs , the site’s purpose , “is to raise money for the general use of a business , ” a securities purpose . 182 Investors are “interested primarily in the profit the note is expected to generate , ” 183 with profit defined by the Court to include ordinary interest . 184 This is also a securities purpose . But investors on sites that offer no interest are not interested in profit because no profit is expected . 185 Their motivations are of a more charitable nature , which cuts against security status . This alone might be enough to keep the loans on sites like Kiva from being securities . The plan - of - distribution factor also appears to point toward securities status . Some of the crowdfunding sites are tied to trading markets where investors buy notes from , or sell them to , other investors . Notes purchased on the Lending Club and Prosper sites , for example , may be traded on a platform maintained by FOLIOfn Investments , a registered broker - dealer . 186 But notes can meet the plan - of - distribution test even if there is no trading market . After first indicating that the plan - of - distribution factor depends on whether “there is ‘common trading for speculation or investment , ’” 187 the Reves opinion said it was sufficient if the notes are “offered and sold to a broad segment of the public , ” even if , as in Reves , there is no market to trade the notes . 188 Crowdfunding lending sites are open to the public , and , by definition , crowdfunding involves investments by a number of small investors . The number of investors will not always be as many as the 1600 purchasers in Reves , 189 but it will typically be more than a few . Thus , notes sold on crowdfunding sites could meet this part of the Reves test even if there is no trading market . 180 Id . , at 67 . 181 Id . , at 69 . 182 Id . , at 66 . 183 Id . , at 66 . 184 Id . , at 68 n . 4 . 185 See Verstein , supra note 22 , at 41 ( agreeing with this analysis ) . 186 See Prosper Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 11 ; Lending Club Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 11 . 187 Id . , at 66 ( citing SEC v . C . M . Joiner Leasing Corp . , 320 U . S . 344 , 351 ( 1943 ) ) . 188 Id . , at 68 . 189 Id . , at 59 . 26 The final factor to consider is the investing public’s reasonable expectations . Reves said little about this factor , but the court notes that notes might be treated as securities on the basis of such public perceptions , “even where an economic analysis of the circumstances of the particular transaction” would suggest otherwise . 190 In applying this factor , the Supreme Court noted only that the notes there were characterized as investments and nothing “would have led a reasonable person to question this characterization . ” 191 The question , as analyzed in the lower courts , seems to be “whether a reasonable member of the investing public would consider these notes as investments . ” 192 That , in turn , probably depends on whether interest is offered and on whether or not the note is presented to investors as an investment . 193 If purchasers are buying the notes for the interest they promise , they appear to be investments , no matter how the crowdfunding site characterizes them . 194 Sites like Kiva that offer no interest are less likely to meet this factor . 195 The Reves analysis supports the characterization of interest - bearing crowdfunding notes as securities , especially given the underlying presumption that notes are securities . Crowdfunding notes that do not promise interest or anything other than a return of principal are probably not securities , in spite of the presumption . As indicated earlier , 196 Lending Club and Prosper have changed their business models since their inception . Originally , lenders on those sites made loans directly to the underlying borrowers and received notes from those borrowers in return . Now , Lending Club and Prosper issue their own notes to lenders and lenders are not directly lending to the underlying borrowers . As far as the definitions of investment contract and note are concerned , this difference is irrelevant . 197 Nothing in the analysis above depends on who the issuer is . 198 190 Id . , at 66 . 191 Id . , at 69 . See also Stoiber v . SEC , 161 F . 3d 745 , 751 ( D . C . Cir . 1998 ) ( describing this factor as a “one - way ratchet” that does not allow notes that are securities under the other factors to escape the securities laws ) . 192 McNabb v .

SEC , 161 F . 3d 745 , 751 ( D . C . Cir . 1998 ) . But see SEC v . Wallenbrock , 313 F . 3d 532 , 539 ( 9th Cir . 2002 ) ( the fact that the promoter “did not use the term “investment” to describe the notes is of little import , given the nature of the transactions” ) . 194 See SEC v . Wallenbrock , 313 F . 3d 532 , 539 ( 9th Cir . 2002 ) ( the reasonable expectations factor is closely related to the motivations factor , and the fact that the promoter did not describe the notes as investments is “of little import” ) . 195 See Verstein , supra note 22 , at 41 ( agreeing with this analysis ) . 196 See text accompanying notes 96 - 101 , supra . 197 See In the Matter of Prosper Marketplace , Inc . , Securities Act Release No . 8984 ( Nov . 24 , 2008 ) ( taking the position that the notes offered by Prosper , under its original model , were securities ) . 198 Who the issuer is might matter for purposes of registration . If Lending Club and Prosper have no obligation on the notes they issue and payment depends entirely on the success of the underlying borrower , should the sites really be considered the issuers for purposes of registration and the disclosure 27 The SEC certainly believes that interest - bearing crowdfunding notes are securities . It has forced both Lending Club and Prosper to register the notes they offer . 199 Before that registration , the SEC entered a consent cease - and - desist order against Prosper , finding that Prosper was improperly selling securities without registration . 200 Prosper has also entered into a settlement with the North American Securities Administrators Association of related claims and has agreed not to sell securities unless it complies with state securities laws . 201 Both companies’ registration statements indicate that it is “reasonably possible” that the sites will be liable to lenders for securities sold prior to registration , 202 and Prosper is currently fighting a class action lawsuit brought by pre - registration lenders . 203 The use of notes adds one additional complication . The Exchange Act definition of security excepts notes with “a maturity at the time of issuance not exceeding nine months , exclusive of days of grace , or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited . ” 204 The Securities Act definition of security includes no such exception , but section 3 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the Securities Act exempts from some , but not all , 205 of the Act’s requirements Any note . . . which arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions , and which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months , exclusive of days of grace , or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited . 206 Crowdfunders might try to avoid the application of federal securities law by promising repayment within nine months . 207 However , both the Exchange Act exception and the Securities Act exemption have traditionally been read to cover only prime - quality commercial paper bought by sophisticated traders . 208 Four dissenters in Reves questioned requirements ?

Until that interpretation changes , crowdfunding notes clearly would not qualify . The risky debt issued by start - up entrepreneurs to the general public would not qualify as commercial paper under this definition . 210 B . Registration and Exemption of Crowdfunded Securities Offerings 1 . Registration If entrepreneurs are offering securities on crowdfunding sites , those offerings must be registered unless an exemption is available . 211 Unfortunately , registration is expensive and time - consuming and registration is unlikely to be a viable option for the small offerings attracted to crowdfunding . The cost of registration will in most cases exceed the amount many micro - entrepreneurs want to raise . 212 The direct costs of preparing and filing the registration statement— registration fees , accounting fees , legal fees , and printing costs—can be hundreds of thousands of dollars , even excluding underwriting costs . 213 Smaller offerings are somewhat less expensive to register than larger ones , 214 but the cost is disproportionately greater for smaller offerings . Registration also takes a substantial amount of time .

The total time from inception to effectiveness can be up to six months or even longer . 216 Smaller companies often need to raise capital quickly ; 217 today’s rapid changes in technology mean “a compressed life - time and a quicker requisite time - to - market . ” 218 As a result , registration is not a viable option for early - stage small businesses seeking relatively small amounts of capital . 219 Everything else equal , issuers would clearly prefer an exemption . 220 Registration , however , is not impossible . Peer - to - peer lenders Prosper and Lending Club have registered the notes they offer , but they had to totally restructure their business models to make it work . Instead of investors providing money directly to the underlying entrepreneurs , investors loan money to the sites themselves and the sites issue non - recourse notes dependent on payment by the underlying borrower . 221 Prosper and Lending Club have each filed a single shelf registration statement for all of the notes they issue , with each funding treated as a separate series requiring a separate prospectus supplement . 222 Each of those prospectus supplements must contain all of the information available on the platform , “no matter how trivial , ” about the particular borrower . 223 This mechanism is costly and burdensome , and would not translate easily to equity crowdfunding . 2 . Possible Exemptions Under Current Law Companies selling securities on crowdfunding sites could avoid registration if an exemption were available . 224 Five exemptions might possibly apply to crowdfunding offerings : ( 1 ) the private offering exemption in section 4 ( 2 ) of the Securities Act 225 or its regulatory safe harbor , Rule 506 of Regulation D ; 226 Section 4 ( 5 ) of the Securities Act ( until recently , section 4 ( 6 ) ) ; 227 Rule 504 of Regulation D ; 228 Rule 505 of Regulation 215 SEC , Report of the Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes , [ 1996 - 97 Transfer Binder ] Fed .

Section 4 ( 2 ) , Rule 506 , and Section 4 ( 5 ) Section 4 ( 2 ) of the Securities Act exempts “transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering . ” 232 The exact boundaries of this exemption are hazy , 233 but the Supreme Court held in the Ralston Purina case that the exemption’s availability turns on whether offerees “ [ need ] the protection of the Act” or are “able to fend for themselves . ” 234 Subsequent lower court cases have focused on the sophistication of the offerees and their access to information about the issuer . 235 A typical crowdfunding offering is not limited to sophisticated investors ; most crowdfunding sites are open to the general public , and the whole point of crowdfunding is to open investment to smaller investors who might not otherwise be able to purchase . Because of that , section 4 ( 2 ) would not be available . The SEC has adopted a regulatory safe harbor for section 4 ( 2 ) , Rule 506 of Regulation D , 236 but that safe harbor would also not be helpful . Purchasers in a Rule 506 offering must either be “accredited investors” or meet a sophistication requirement . 237 Accredited investors are primarily sophisticated institutions or individual investors who meet wealth or income standards . 238 The purchasers on a publicly accessible crowdfunding site would not all meet these requirements ; the whole point of the crowdfunding exemption proposals is to open non - registered offerings to purchasers who do not meet these requirements . Rule 506 has another condition that disqualifies the typical crowdfunding offering . “General solicitation” and “general advertising” of the offering are prohibited . 239 The SEC and its staff take the position that any solicitation of an investor with whom the issuer or its sales representatives do not have a preexisting relationship violates the 229 Rule 505 , 17 C .

R . § 230 . 502 ( c ) . 31 general solicitation restriction . 240 A publicly accessible solicitation of funds on a crowdfunding site would clearly violate this prohibition . 241 Section 4 ( 5 ) of the Securities Act , until recently section 4 ( 6 ) , is similar to Rule 506 . It allows offers and sales solely to accredited investors provided there is no “advertising or public solicitation . ” 242 Section 4 ( 5 ) thus poses the same problems as Rule 506 , but with one additional limitation : the offering amount may not exceed $ 5 million . 243 Section 4 ( 5 ) is also of little use to small businesses engaged in crowdfunding . 244 b . Rule 505 Rule 505 exempts offerings of up to $ 5 million , 245 but it also contains restrictions that make it unsuitable for crowdfunding . First , Rule 505 is subject to the same general solicitation restrictions as Rule 506 . 246 In addition , a Rule 506 issuer may sell to no more than 35 non - accredited investors . 247 Some crowdfunding offerings might meet this restriction , but , given the small amounts contributed by each investor , others probably would not . 248 c . Rule 504 Rule 504 exempts offerings of up to $ 1 million . 249 At least one major crowdfunding site , ProFounder , attempted to structure its offerings to fall within this rule , 250 but Rule 504 presents problems for a more typical crowdfunding site . First , Rule 504 , like Rules 505 and 506 , is subject to the general solicitation restriction . 251 The only exception is if the Rule 504 offering is subject to state registration requirements or sold pursuant to a state 240 See . , e . g . , In the Matter of Kenman Corporation , Exchange Act Release No . 21962 , 1985 WL 548507 , at n . 6 ( SEC Apr . 19 , 1985 ) . See generally 1 HAZEN , supra note 48 , at 540 ; William K . Sjostrom , Jr . , supra note 219 , at 13 - 14 According to Sjostrom , the SEC has indicated that a preexisting relationship is not the only way to avoid the general solicitation ban , but the SEC has not granted any no - action relief where a preexisting relationship is absent .

See text accompanying notes 110 - 112 , supra . 251 Rule 502 ( c ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 502 ( c ) ( 2007 ) . The SEC eliminated the general solicitation ban for Rule 504 offerings in 1992 , but reinstated it in its current form in 1999 . See William K . Sjostrom , Jr . , supra note 219 , at 25 . 32 exemption that limits sales to accredited investors . 252 ProFounder attempted to circumvent the general solicitation restriction by limiting access to private - raise offerings to friends , family members , and preexisting acquaintances of each entrepreneur—in other words , those with whom the issuer has a preexisting relationship . 253 This may solve the general solicitation problem , but it eliminates much of the value of crowdfunding . A publicly accessible crowdfunding offering could not use Rule 504 unless the offering was registered at the state level , and that registration could be prohibitively expensive . 254 d . Regulation A Regulation A is available to offerings by non - reporting companies 255 of up to $ 5 million . 256 Unlike Regulation D , Regulation A does not prohibit general solicitation . It does , however , require issuers to file a disclosure document 257 and , like section 5 of the Securities Act , Regulation A includes rather extensive limits on communications with investors , tied to the filing and disclosure requirements . 258 Regulation A is , in effect , a “mini - registration , ” a less expensive version of what the Act itself requires absent an exemption . 259 Regulation A does not appear to be relied on extensively by small businesses , 260 probably because of its expense . Regulation A is not cheap ; the average 252 Rule 502 ( c ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 502 ( c ) ( 2007 ) ( “Except as provided in § 230 . 504 ( b ) ( 1 ) , . . . ” ) ; Rule 504 ( b ) ( 1 ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 504 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( 2007 ) ( sold in one or more states requiring registration and delivery of a disclosure document to investors or pursuant to a state exemption allowing general solicitation in offerings limited to accredited investors ) . 253 Entrepreneurs are asked to “invite investors who are friends , family , or others who you know in your community . ” Lang , supra note 117 . An “invite e - mail” is sent to those investors . See How It Works , PROFOUNDER , http : / / www . profounder . com / investors / ( last visited July 20 , 2011 ) .

As far as I can tell , ProFounder did not verify that each person invited has a preexisting relationship . As a result , it is possible that at least some of ProFounder’s entrepreneurs were less restrictive in providing invitations to potential investors , and thus violated the general solicitation condition . 254 See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 36 . 255 Rule 251 ( a ) ( 2 ) , 17 C .

J . CORP . L . 77 , 82 - 83 ( 2006 ) . 33 cost of a Regulation A offering in 1997 was $ 40 , 000 - 60 , 000 . 261 This is too expensive for the very small offerings that crowdfunding attracts . 262 IV . The Status of Crowdfunding Sites Under Federal Securities Law All of the proposals to exempt crowdfunding focus primarily on the offerings themselves and the need for an exemption from Securities Act registration . But crowdfunding can function effectively only through web sites that bring entrepreneurs and potential investors together , and the operation of those sites raises a different set of issues under federal securities law . If the investments offered on crowdfunding sites are securities , the operators of the sites might be brokers subject to regulation under the Exchange Act . They might also be investment advisers covered by the Investment Advisers Act . Unfortunately , whether crowdfunding sites are brokers or investment advisers is uncertain , primarily because the applicable legal standards are unclear . There is a strong possibility that crowdfunding sites would be brokers and a somewhat lesser , but still significant , chance that they would be investment advisers . The answer to one additional regulatory issue is clear . Although crowdfunding sites bring together buyers and sellers of securities , and therefore at least superficially resemble securities exchanges , they would not be treated as exchanges under federal securities law . A . Are Crowdfunding Sites Exchanges ? At first blush , crowdfunding sites might seem to be securities “exchanges” required to register under the Exchange Act . Section 3 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the Exchange Act defines “exchange” as an “organization , association , or group of persons” that “constitutes , maintains , or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood . ” 263 Crowdfunding sites that offer securities bring together investors buying securities and the entrepreneurs selling them . The sites match these buyers and sellers and facilitate execution of the sales much as a securities exchange would . However , it is reasonably clear that crowdfunding sites , unless they engage in additional activities , would not be exchanges . 261 1 HAZEN , supra note 48 , at 512 n . 20 . See also 24 PRIFTI , supra note 213 , at 1A - 108 ( Costs of a Regulation A offering include : filing fee $ 100 ; underwriting costs 10 - 18 % of the offering amount ; printing costs $ 7 , 500 - 15 , 000 ; engraving stock certificates $ 1 , 500 ; legal costs ¾ - 3 % of the offering amount ; accounting costs $ 5 , 000 - 20 , 000 ; expert fees $ 300 - 5 , 000 ; state filing fees $ 150 - 4 , 000 per state ; and NASD filing fees $ 500 plus . 01 % of the offering amount ) . 262 “On the small offering end of the Regulation A spectrum , . . . issuers are discouraged from using Regulation A by the complexities of the filing , disclosure , and other requirements and by the difficulties in many instances of meeting state blue sky law requirements . Together , the costs of meeting these federal and state requirements overwhelm any benefit a small business would attain from utilizing Regulation A . ” Campbell , supra note 260 , at 111 See also Sjostrom , supra note 219 , at 26 ( “preparing a Regulation A offering statement can cost a small company a significant amount of money and management time” ) . 263 Exchange Act § 3 ( a ) ( 1 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 78c ( a ) ( 1 ) . 34 In 1998 , in an attempt to facilitate on - line , alternative trading systems , the SEC substantially revised the rules concerning exchanges . 264 Among other things , those new rules clarify the definition of exchange in a way that would exclude crowdfunding sites . Rule 3b - 16 provides that , to fall within the definition of exchange in section 3 ( a ) ( 1 ) , a trading system must , among other things , “ [ bring ] together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers . ” 265 In other words , for a system’s trading of a particular security to make it an exchange , there must be more than one person on each side of the transactions in that security . The Commission made it clear that “systems in which there is only a single seller , such as systems that permit issuers to sell their own securities to investors , would not be included within Rule 3b - 16 . ” 266 The SEC gives the following example of a system that would not meet this multiple - seller requirement : System S permits an issuer to post prices to sell its own securities to a broker - dealer ' s customers . The issuer is under no obligation to post prices on the system and may choose to do so at any time . If a customer accepts the posted price and size , System S routes the order to the issuer who retains discretion to accept or reject the trade . If the posted price or size is not accepted as posted , System S automatically alerts the issuer that further negotiation is necessary . 267 Crowdfunding sites fit this model . Although each company’s security has a large number of buyers , meeting the multiple - buyer requirement , there is only one seller , the issuer itself . Crowdfunding sites list the securities of a number of different sellers , but the question is whether there are multiple sellers for a particular security . According to the SEC , “a system that has multiple sellers , but only one seller for each instrument , . . . would not be considered to meet the “multiple parties” requirement . ” 268 Unless the sites get involved in post - funding trading of listed company’s securities , 269 none of the securities offered would have multiple sellers . Therefore , crowdfunding sites would not be exchanges . B . Are Crowdfunding Sites Brokers ? Section 3 ( a ) ( 4 ) of the Exchange Act defines a “broker” as “any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others . ” 270 The question , 264 See Regulation of Exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems , Release No . 34 - 40760 , 63 Fed . Reg . 70844 - 01 ( Dec . 22 , 1998 ) . 265 Exchange Act Rule 3b - 16 , 17 C . F .

The release concludes that System S is not an exchange under Rule 3b - 16 because it “has only one seller . ” Id . The release specifically points to CP Direct , a site that allowed issuers to sell commercial paper to customers of CS First Boston , as a system that would not have multiple sellers , and therefore would not be an exchange .

D . 2 , infra , for a discussion of issues involving the resale of crowdfunded securities . 270 Exchange Act § 3 ( a ) ( 4 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 78c ( a ) ( 4 ) . The Exchange Act distinguishes a “dealer , ” who is “engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for such person’s own account . ” Exchange Act § 3 ( a ) ( 15 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 78c ( a ) ( 15 ) ( emphasis added ) . A dealer , in other words , acts as a principal , trading for itself , whereas a broker acts as an agent for someone else . However , the distinction “often becomes 35 broadly phrased , is whether the person has “a certain regularity of participation in securities transactions at key points in the chain of distribution . ” 271 The Exchange Act provides no further guidance as to what it means to be “engaged in a business” or “effecting transactions in securities . ” The case law is limited , so most of the guidance in this area comes from SEC no - action letters . 272 Would crowdfunding sites be brokers if they hosted securities offerings ? 273 Unfortunately , the answer is uncertain . 274 Whether an individual or entity is a broker is “one of the more nebulous questions in U . S . securities regulation . ” 275 The test is “extremely flexible , ” 276 and therefore inherently unpredictable . Much of the uncertainty arises from the nature of the no - action letter process . The SEC staff “does not typically provide a rationale for its position” in no - action letter , forcing the reader “to speculate which of numerous facts recited in the response and / or letter of inquiry triggered the staff reaction . ” 277 1 . Engaged in the Business It is reasonably clear that crowdfunding sites offering securities would satisfy the “engaged in the business” part of the definition . The real issue is whether they are effecting transactions in securities . blurred , ” with cases and administrative analyses indiscriminately using the two terms together . 15 DAVID A .

[ one’s ] . . . business activities . ” 280 If the crowdfunding sites are effecting transactions in securities , they undoubtedly are “engaged in the business” of doing so . Their activity is regular ; they match investors and entrepreneurs on a continuous basis . And , with the exception of sites like Kiva , which operates on a donation basis , they do so for a business purpose , to earn a profit . 281 Thus , the real question is whether crowdfunding sites are effecting transactions in securities . 2 . Effecting Transactions in Securities a . General guidance What exactly does it mean to effect transactions in securities ? Obviously , the stereotypical stock broker , who buys and sells securities on a stock exchange for a customer’s account , is covered , 282 but crowdfunding sites do not fit that stereotype . The definition also includes companies whose involvement in securities transactions is less direct , “so long as the person participates in significant stages or points of a securities transaction , such as solicitation , structuring , negotiation , and receipt or transmission of funds . ” 283 It does not matter how the site and its users characterize the site’s services . One cannot avoid being a broker “by describing the work . . . in terms which suggest a non broker - client relationship . ” 284 Therefore , statements such as that on ProFounder’s web site that it “is not a broker , dealer or underwriter of securities” 285 have no effect . An SEC interpretive release cautions that the operators of web sites that match investors with issuers need to consider registration as brokers when those sites are not affiliated with registered broker - dealers . 286 In addition a guide released by the SEC’s Division of 278 SEC v .

"  " Does your compensation for participation in the transaction depend upon , or is it related to , the outcome or size of the transaction or deal ? . . . Do you receive any other transaction - related compensation ? ”  “Are you otherwise engaged in the business of effecting or facilitating securities transactions ? ”  " Do you handle the securities or funds of others in connection with securities transactions ? " 288 Beyond that , the most helpful guidance comes from a series of no - action letters involving Internet - or computer - based matching services that connect entrepreneurs seeking funds with potential investors . 289 The services granted relief in those letters share a number of important features :  They were run by non - profit entities .  They charged a flat fee that did not depend on whether a successful match occurred or whether the entrepreneur raised the desired funds . That fee was used only to cover administrative expenses .  The matching site’s role was essentially completed when the entrepreneur and the investor were introduced . From that point forward , everything occurred off - site .  The matching service was not involved in negotiating or closing any transactions between the entrepreneur and investors .  The matching service did not handle any funds or securities in connection with the financing .  The matching service provided no advice to either entrepreneurs or investors and did not assist them in completing the financing . As far as I have been able to determine , none of the major crowdfunding sites has received no - action relief from the SEC .

Although there are some similarities , the crowdfunding sites differ in important ways that make it more likely they would be considered brokers . b . Transaction - Based Compensation Unlike the matching services in the no - action letters , many of the crowdfunding sites charge fees that depend on whether the financing is successful . Kickstarter’s fee is five percent of the funds raised ; if the fundraising is unsuccessful , entrepreneurs pay no fee . 291 IndieGoGo takes four percent of the funds raised . 292 Prosper and Lending Club each charge a one - percent fee . 293 When ProFounder was selling securities , at least part of its fee apparently depended on whether the offering was successful . 294 Kiva , however , operates exclusively on a donation basis ; it does not receive a fee from either entrepreneurs or borrowers , although it does accept donations from its lenders . 295 The SEC staff has made it clear that transaction - based compensation like this “is a key factor in determining whether a person or entity is acting as a broker - dealer . ” 296 David Lipton identifies the lack of transaction - based compensation as one of three possible justifications for the no - action letters granted to web - based matching services . 297 According to an American Bar Association Task Force , “ [ t ] ransaction - based compensation has come under intense scrutiny by the SEC” 298 and the staff may be moving to a position where transaction - based compensation in connection with a 290 Verstein , supra note 22 , at 19 . 291 See Frequently Asked Questions , KICKSTARTER , www . kickstarter . com / help / faq ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) ( under the heading “Fees” ) . 292 See Pricing , INDIEGOGO , http : / / www . indiegogo . com / about / pricing ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) .

See also Orcutt , supra note 275 , at 908 ( transaction - based compensation has “garnered substantial attention” ) . 39 securities transaction may alone be sufficient to make one a broker . 299 The staff’s concern is apparently that transaction - based compensation would give the person “a ‘salesman’s stake in the proposed transactions and . . . create heightened incentive for . . . [ the person ] . . . to engage in sales efforts . ” 300 However , it is possible to receive transaction - based compensation in connection with securities transactions and still not be considered a broker . A recent district court case recognized that transaction - based compensation “is the hallmark of a salesman , ” 301 but nevertheless held that an individual who received transaction - based compensation for merely bringing people together for a securities transaction was not a broker . 302 And the SEC has granted a few no - action letters to finders who received transaction - based compensation . The most well - known of these letters involved the entertainer Paul Anka , who provided the names of potential investors to the Ottawa Senators Hockey Club in return for a finder’s fee equal to ten percent of the amount the investors invested . 303 However , Anka’s role was limited to providing the names of investors to the Club ; he did not solicit or even contact the potential investors and was not involved in negotiations between the Club and the investors . 304 The other no - action letters allowing transaction - based compensation involved finders whose roles were similarly limited ; they were not involved in negotiations , consummation of the financing , or transferring funds or securities to effect the deal . 305 David Lipton reads these letters as allowing finders to receive transaction - based compensation only if the finder is “totally isolated from the process of selling the units . ” 306 Anka himself originally proposed to contact the investors to describe the issuer and the price of the investment and forward their names to the Club only if the investor expressed interest . The SEC staff granted the request only after a follow - up letter limited Anka’s role to providing names . 307 It is clear why transaction - based compensation might be more acceptable to the SEC where the finder’s involvement is so limited . If the finder has no ongoing contact with potential investors , the incentive “to engage in abusive or sharp selling practices” that transaction - based compensation might otherwise create cannot be acted on . 308 299 Id . , at 977 .

For example , the staff denied a no - action request from a finder whose only role would be to contact existing business associates and friends , describe potential oil and gas investments in general terms , and provide the approximate cost of drilling a well . 309 As discussed below , crowdfunding sites typically do much more than just introduce investors to entrepreneurs . They are actively involved in the transactions between entrepreneurs and investors . A finder who receives transaction - based compensation and is involved in structuring a securities transaction or negotiating the terms of any deal would clearly be a broker under the SEC’s analysis . 310 In fact , it is not even clear that the SEC staff still agrees with the limited position it took in the Paul Anka letter . 311 The SEC staff currently views even the limited activity of introducing a potential buyer and seller of securities “with skepticism when coupled with transaction - based compensation . ” 312 Consider , for example , the staff’s recent response in Brumberg , Mackey & Wall , P . C . 313 A law firm proposed to help a company acquire financing by introducing it to a limited number of contacts . In return , the company would pay the firm a percentage of the amounts raised . The firm was not going to be involved in negotiations , provide the potential investors with any information about the company , recommend or have any responsibility for the terms of any agreement , or have any involvement in obtaining financing for the transactions . The staff’s response noted that transaction - based compensation “is a hallmark of broker - dealer activity . Accordingly , any person receiving transaction - based compensation in connection with another person’s purchaser or sale of securities typically must register as a broker - dealer or be an associated person of a registered broker - dealer . ” 314 However , even in this letter , it is hard to isolate transaction - based compensation as the sole determining factor . The staff also believed that the firm’s introduction of only contacts with a potential interest in the company would necessarily involve some “pre - selling” of the company and some “pre - screening” of potential investors . 315 Unfortunately , a recent district court case muddies the water even more and casts doubt on the validity of the SEC’s position with respect to transaction - based compensation . In SEC v . M & A West , Inc . , 316 the defendant worked with the shareholders of private 309 Richard S .

According to the court , although the defendant facilitated securities transactions , his actions were not “effecting” transactions in securities . 319 c . Involvement in the Transactions The extent of a site’s involvement in the actual securities transaction is also important . The other possible justifications David Lipton provides for the no - action letters granted to web - based matching services are : ( 1 ) the system merely identified the investors and entrepreneurs and “was not assisting the purchase or sale of specific securities ; ” 320 and ( 2 ) the system operator was not involved in the transactions other than to provide the match . 321 The matching sites , and other finders , approved by the SEC no - action letters simply brought investors and entrepreneurs together . Once that introduction was made , the matching site’s work was done . The transaction was conducted off - site and , in many cases , the web operator did not even know if the financing occurred . Crowdfunding sites do more than just bring entrepreneurs and investors together . They provide a platform for investors and entrepreneurs to negotiate ; they facilitate ongoing communications between investors and entrepreneurs ; and they transmit funds and investment documents back and forth between investors and entrepreneurs . That , coupled with the receipt of transaction - based compensation , could be enough to make them brokers . ( 1 ) Providing Advice or Recommendations Providing advice or recommendations to investors is a factor in deciding whether one is a broker . 322 Most crowdfunding sites provide only general advice , and do not recommend or rate particular investment opportunities . Kickstarter , for example , provides general advice to investors about how to avoid fraud . 323 And some of the sites do provide general advice to entrepreneurs about how to structure a successful fundraising campaign . The Kickstarter site , for example , includes advice about how much money to ask for and “the secret” to successful fundraising . 324 IndieGoGo and ProFounder offer general advice 317 Id . , at * 3 . 318 Id . , at * 3 - 4 . 319 Id . , at * 9 .

Both Lending Club and Prosper rate borrowers , effectively advising investors as to the quality of the loans . Some of the sites screen entities seeking funding . ProFounder indicates that it entrepreneurs must pass a fraud protection screening , although it doesn’t indicate what that involves . Kiva refuses to partner with lenders that charge “exorbitant interest rates . ” 326 And ProFounder , before it quit offering securities , helped entrepreneurs structure and complete their offerings . It agreed to make a good faith effort “to provide all documents necessary for compliance with securities and other laws applicable to Company ' s issuance of securities and Investor ' s PRIVATE investment , ” although it noted that compliance was ultimately the entrepreneur’s responsibility . 327 ProFounder also provided term sheets and “compliance tools” to entrepreneurs , 328 and helped entrepreneurs track compliance requirements and filing fees . 329 ( 2 ) Structuring the Transaction Involvement in structuring a securities transaction is another factor pointing toward broker status . 330 Prosper and Lending Club each specify the terms of the loans on their sites . 331 None of the other sites are involved in structuring individual deals , but they do limit how deals funneled through the sites must be structured . IndieGoGo and ProFounder , for example , limit how long a funding request may be open ; the limit is 120 days at IndieGoGo and 30 days at ProFounder . 332 ProFounder required quarterly payments to investors and imposed a five - year limit on how long an entrepreneur could share returns with investors . 333 ProFounder also allowed entrepreneurs to exit their commitments early only if they paid investors twice their investment . 334 325 See Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQs ) , INDIEGOGO , http : / / www . indiegogo . com / about / faqs ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) ; Lang , supra note 117 . 326 See Do Kiva’s Field Partners Charge Interest to the Borrowers ? , KIVA , http : / / na3 . salesforce . com / _ ui / selfservice / pkb / PublicKnowledgeSolution / d ? orgId = 00D500000006svl & id = 5 0150000000IIav ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) . 327 , ProFounder Terms and Conditions for Services , PROFOUNDER ( Aug . 16 , 2010 ) , http : / / www . profounder . com / legal / terms _ and _ conditions ( ¶ 4 ) .

However , this early repayment option is not done through the ProFounder web site . Id . 43 ( 3 ) Receipt or transmission of funds / continued involvement after the financing The receipt or transmission of funds or securities is another criterion considered in determining whether someone is a broker . 335 All of the major crowdfunding sites actually collect funds from investors and forward them to the entrepreneurs . 336 The sites where entrepreneurs offer financial rewards also transfer those funds back to investors . 337 At ProFounder , entrepreneurs had to report their revenues on a quarterly basis and even upload their tax returns each year to verify the reported revenues . 338 Similarly , Kickstarter and IndieGoGo encourage entrepreneurs to post project updates . 339 ( 4 ) Involvement in negotiations Another relevant factor is involvement in negotiations between investors and entrepreneurs . A person involved in the negotiation of securities transactions is “virtually always” treated as a broker . 340 Crowdfunding sites are not actively involved in negotiations between the entrepreneurs who list on the sites and potential investors . The communications portals on crowdfunding sites obviously facilitate negotiations , but merely facilitating the exchange of information or documents is not sufficient to make one a broker . 341 d . Solicitation and Advertising Another factor relevant to broker status is whether the person is actively advertising or otherwise soliciting investors . 342 Solicitation is defined fairly broadly ; the question is 335 15 LIPTON , supra note 270 , at 1 - 43 .

And “mere repeated advertising to purchase or sell securities would trigger the broker - dealer registration requirement . ” 344 Unfortunately , the SEC “has not provided much guidance on what activities constitute solicitation or advertising sufficient to trigger broker - dealer registration . 345 However , the SEC staff has approved several web - based electronic matching systems , so a web presence alone would not make one a broker . And some of the no - action letters have involved solicitation or advertising beyond that . For example , the SEC staff granted no - action relief to Venture Capital Resources , Inc . , which planned to publicize its system through one - on - one discussion with potential investors , asking CPAs and attorneys if they had clients who might be interested , a “selected mailing program , ” press releases , advertisements , and distributing brochures through local financial institutions . 346 Another non - profit matching service which received relief planned to publicize the system through accounting firms , law firms , local universities , and non - profit organizations interested in economic development , as well as by distributing pamphlets and brochures to interested individuals and groups . 347 On the other hand , another SEC staff response indicated that a for - profit web site would be a broker because , among other things , it “actively solicits investors to purchase oil and gas interests ( for example , by targeting potential investors with direct mailings and follow - up e - mail ) . ” 348 Thus , the line between broker and non - broker status is hazy at best when it comes to solicitation and advertising . e . For - Profit Status Finally , many crowdfunding sites , unlike the matching services granted no - action relief , are for - profit entities . Almost all of the no - action letters involving matching - service web sites have involved “state instrumentalities , private non - profit corporations , and quasi - governmental organizations , ” 349 and the staff has generally required representations that these systems would be run solely on a cost - recovery basis , and not for profit . 350 For - profit status does not automatically make one a broker . The SEC staff has granted no - action relief to a few private matching sites , but none of those received transaction - based compensation and , in all cases , the transactions arising from those sites were negotiated and completed , and funds transferred , off the site . 351 343 Orcutt , supra note 275 , at 914 . 344 15 LIPTON , supra note 270 , at 1 - 42 . 13 . 345 Task Force on Private Placement Broker - Dealers , supra note 298 , at 979 . 346 Venture Capital Resources , Inc . , SEC No - Action Letter , 1985 WL 55644 ( Oct . 25 , 1985 ) .

Compare 45 3 . Conclusion : Would Crowdfunding Sites Be Brokers ? What is one to make of all this ? Given the messy state of the law , no definitive answer is possible , but there is a very strong possibility that the operators of crowdfunding sites would be considered brokers if they listed offerings of securities . Howard Friedman concludes that web sites that bring investors together with businesses seeking capital must either register as brokers or operate under the overall supervision of a registered broker - dealer , particularly “when the website operator will receive an additional fee for transactions consummated through the website . ” 352 And the staff response in The International Business Exchange Corp . ( IBEC ) letter , 353 which Lipton sees as providing a concise summary of the SEC staff’s position , 354 probably represents the ultimate limit of what one may do without becoming a broker . IBEC , unlike the crowdfunding operators , did not advertise the sale of securities , handled no funds , did not advise investors or entrepreneurs , and , after investors and entrepreneurs came together , IBEC’s role was limited to transmitting documents . The crowdfunding sites’ receipt of transaction - based compensation , continued involvement in the investor - entrepreneur relationship , public advertising , and for - profit status may cumulatively be too much to avoid broker status . C . Are Crowdfunding Sites Investment Advisers ? Crowdfunding sites might also be investment advisers within the meaning of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 . Unfortunately , what “investment adviser” means in this context is as unclear as what “broker” means ; if anything , there is less guidance available on the investment - adviser question . Two issues must be addressed : ( 1 ) do crowdfunding sites fall within the general definition of investment adviser ; and ( 2 ) if they do , does the “publisher” exception in that definition exclude them ? 1 . The General Definition of Investment Adviser The basic definition of investment adviser in Section 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) of the Investment Advisers Act 355 has two parts , either of which suffices to make one an investment adviser . First , a person is an investment adviser if he , “for compensation , engages in the business of advising others , either directly or through publications or writings , as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in , purchasing , or selling securities . ” 356 Alternatively , a person is an investment adviser , if he , “for compensation and as part of a regular business , issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities . ” 357 Under either part of the definition , three basic requirements must be met : ( 1 ) The person must be providing advice or issuing reports or analyses concerning securities ; OilOre . com , SEC No - Action Letter , 2000 WL 546573 ( April 21 , 2000 ) ( no - action relief refused to a for - profit entity that was to receive compensation contingent on the investor making an investment ) . 352 FRIEDMAN , supra note 283 , at 16 - 6 . 1 .

No case law directly addresses whether electronic matching services or other web sites that post securities offerings are investment advisers . The answer must come primarily from SEC responses to no - action requests , and , unfortunately , the SEC’s Division of Investment Management has stopped responding to no - action requests on this issue . 359 2 . In the Business The business requirement is phrased slightly differently in the two parts of section 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) . The first alternative uses the phrase “engages in the business” and the second alternative requires that the analysis be given “as part of a regular business , ” 360 but the SEC interprets the business element identically for both parts of the definition . 361 Some regularity is required ; isolated instances of investment advice do not make one an investment adviser . 362 But investment advice does not have to be the person’s principal business , as long as the advice is given on a regular basis . 363 Crowdfunding sites would undoubtedly meet this regularity requirement . If their services constitute securities advice or analysis , they are providing that service on an ongoing , regular basis . As with broker status , transaction - based compensation is important . The SEC has indicated that a person meets the “business” requirement if he “receives transaction - based compensation if the client implements the investment advice . ” 364 Thus , it is reasonably clear that for - profit crowdfunding sites would meet the “business” requirement . 358 Applicability of the Investment Advisers Act to Financial Planners , Pension Consultants , and Other Persons Who Provide Investment Advisory Services as a Component of Other Financial Services , Investment Advisers Act Release No .

LEMKE & GERALD T . LINS , REGULATION OF INVESTMENT ADVISERS 5 ( 2011 ) . 364 According to the SEC , a person is in the business if he " ( i ) holds himself out as an investment adviser or as one who provides investment advice , ( ii ) receives any separate or additional compensation that represents a clearly definable charge for providing advice about securities , regardless of whether the compensation is separate from or included within any overall compensation , or receives transaction - based compensation if the client implements in the investment advice , or ( iii ) on anything other than rare , isolated 47 3 . For Compensation For one to be an investment adviser , the advice or analysis must be provided for compensation . 365 Any economic benefit is sufficient to meet this requirement ; the adviser does not have to charge a separate fee for the advisory portion of the services . 366 Most crowdfunding sites charge a fee of some kind , whether it’s a flat fee , a percentage of the amount raised , or interest . 367 This would satisfy the compensation requirement . 368 And it doesn’t matter that any payment for the “advice” or “analysis” is paid only if a transaction is completed . One can be an investment adviser even if compensation is contingent on the client implementing the advice . 369 4 . Advice , Analyses , or Reports Concerning Securities Most crowdfunding sites are not offering advice “as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in , purchasing , or selling securities . ” 370 They may , however , be issuing “analyses or reports concerning securities , ” 371 assuming that securities are being offered on the site . But the case law and guidance from the SEC are simply too uncertain to offer a definitive conclusion . Consider first the advice portion of the definition . Most of the existing crowdfunding sites do not advise investors as to the merits of particular opportunities , or evaluate or rate the potential investments . They make it clear that an entrepreneur’s inclusion is not an endorsement by the site , and the sites include disclaimers that they are not providing investment advice . Advice does not have to relate to specific securities to make one an investment adviser . 372 A discussion of the relative advantages of investing in securities rather than other investments would suffice , 373 but crowdfunding sites typically do not even do this . and non - periodic instances , provides specific investment advice . " Investment Advisers Release , supra note 362 , at 38402 ( emphasis added ) . 365 “The rendering of investment advice without compensation is likely to take the person rendering the advice out from under the purview of the Investment Advisers Act . ” 7 HAZEN , supra note 48 , at 29 . 366 Investment Advisers Release , supra note 362 , at 38403 ; U .

See also LEMKE & LINS , supra note 363 , at 6 - 7 . 48 The obvious exceptions are Prosper and Lending Club , which assign ratings to individual loans . If Prosper and Lending Clubs were selling those loans directly to lenders , as they did prior to registration , the case for investment adviser status would be strong . Their current pass - through programs cloud the analysis . Now , they are , in effect , commenting on the value of their own notes , not advising investors as to securities issued by others . Almost every issuer of securities discusses the value of the securities its issuer ; if that were enough to make one an investment adviser , then every company would be an investment adviser . Thus , as long as the SEC continues to treat Prosper and Lending Club as the “issuers” of these securities , it is difficult to see them as investment advisers . For the other crowdfunding sites , the problem , if there is one , comes under the second part of the definition . Crowdfunding sites may be issuing “analyses or reports concerning securities . ” The SEC staff has indicated that someone providing investors with statistical data on companies or a listing of investment opportunities is not issuing analyses or reports if ( 1 ) the information is readily available to the public in its raw state ; ( 2 ) the categories of information presented are not highly selective ; and ( 3 ) the information is not organized or presented in a manner that suggests the purchase , holding , or sale of any security . 374 These requirements seem problematic for crowdfunding sites . The entrepreneur’s information is not readily available to the public other than through the crowdfunding site . And the whole point of the listing is to suggest that investors purchase a security by investing in the entrepreneurs’ companies . But , as I discuss below , the SEC staff has granted no - action relief to several matching services while citing these criteria . Like crowdfunding sites , those matching services are created to promote the purchase of entrepreneurs’ securities and , as with crowdfunding sites , the information provided by those small business entrepreneurs is not typically publicly available . There are no cases involving crowdfunding sites’ status as investment advisers , but the limited case law is consistent with treating them as investment advisers . Two cases have held that general partners’ financial reports to limited partners on the status of the partnerships’ investments were investment advice for purposes of the definition of investment adviser . 375 Those reports , like the company reports available to investors on some crowdfunding sites , included financial statements and a calculation of investors’ returns . 376 The defendants were not offering the limited partners any actual advice in these reports , merely providing performance data , but the courts concluded that the 374 See , e . g . , Angel Capital Electronic Network , SEC No - Action Letter , 1996 WL 636094 ( Oct . 25 , 1996 ) ; Missouri Innovation Center , Inc . , SEC No - Action Letter , 1995 WL 643949 ( Oct . 17 , 1995 ) ; Media General Financial Services , Inc . , SEC No - Action Letter , 1992 WL 198262 ( July 20 , 1992 ) ; Investex Investment Exchange Inc . , SEC No - Action Letter , Fed .

Saltzman , 127 F . Supp . 2d at 669 . 49 limited partners would use the reports to decide whether to continue their investments in the partnership . This was enough to trigger the Investment Advisers Act . 377 Similarly , even if the crowdfunding sites are not advising investors to invest in a particular company , they are providing the reports the investors will use to make their investment decisions . Most crowdfunding sites , however , do not independently generate reports on the companies listed ; they merely post funding requests and other information produced by the entrepreneurs themselves . Because they function as mere conduits for this information and do not create anything themselves , they arguably are not providing any “advice” or “analyses” or “reports” at all . However , at least two cases have rejected this “mere conduit” argument . In SEC v . Wall Street Transcript Corp . , 378 the defendant published a weekly tabloid containing verbatim reprints of reports on securities issued by brokers . The district court concluded that “there can be no doubt that , for purposes of the . . . [ Investment Advisers Act ] , . . . [ the defendant ] . . . ‘issues’ analyses and reports concerning securities . ” 379 The court rejected the defendant’s argument that merely reprinting the content of others without endorsement was not investment advice : “That a publication acts as a mere conduit for investment advice written by others obviously does not insure against the possibility that the publisher will engage in the fraudulent activities the Act was designed to prevent . ” 380 Similarly , in Zinn v . Parrish , 381 a sports agent occasionally transmitted to one of his clients securities recommendations made by others . 382 The court held that the agent was not “in the business” of offering investment advice , but noted that , if the agent had passed along such recommendations more regularly , he might be an investment adviser . 383 5 . SEC No - Action Letters As with the definition of broker , the primary source of guidance on the investment adviser issue is SEC no - action letters . The SEC staff has issued a large number of no - action letters on the “investment adviser” issue to companies that either attempt to match investors and entrepreneurs 384 or simply present investment opportunities for investors’ 377 In those cases , the general partners were also actually making investment decisions for the partnership , but both courts seemed to see the reports themselves as sufficient to make one an investment adviser . 378 454 F .

Crowdfunding sites typically are operated for profit , not by a non - profit institution . They often charge transaction - based compensation . Although the site operator is not directly involved in negotiations , negotiation and completion of the transactions is done on the crowdfunding site , not directly between the investor and the entrepreneur . And crowdfunding sites do handle funds and securities ; both the initial investments and the returns paid to investors are handled through the site . What is not clear from the no - action letters is exactly why these facts are important or whether these differences are important enough to make crowdfunding sites investment advisers . Thomas Hazen reads these no - action letters as allowing the use of “passive” bulletin boards to post information about securities as long as ( 1 ) the bulletin boards are not involved in any negotiations regarding investments arising from using of the bulletin board ; and ( 2 ) the board operator gives no advice “regarding the merits or shortcomings of any particular trade . ” 396 Thomas Lemke and Gerald Lins agree with Hazen’s two restrictions , but add a third : the bulletin board operator may not “receive compensation in connection with the purchase or sale of any stock listed on the bulletin board . ” 397 These interpretations , if correct , are problematic for crowdfunding sites . As previously discussed , crowdfunding sites do typically receive transaction - based compensation . Crowdfunding sites are also more involved in negotiations than the typical matching site . The operators of crowdfunding sites do not directly participate in negotiating or closing the deals , but , unlike the matching sites approved by the SEC staff , the deal actually is consummated on the crowdfunding site , and the sites do handle the transfer of funds . However , one important distinction between crowdfunding sites and matching services points in the opposite direction . Matching services , by definition , attempt to match investors with offerings that suit the investors’ interests . When a match is made , the service is , in effect , “advising” the investor that the particular offering fits the investor’s needs . Crowdfunding sites do not typically screen investment opportunities in that way . Investors can see all of the opportunities and it is up to the investor to make an unaided selection from among those opportunities . The element of “advice or “analysis” is arguably missing . The SEC staff has granted no - action relief to several sites that merely posted available opportunities , with no attempt to match investors to those opportunities . 398 But only one 395 Venture Capital Resources , Inc . , SEC No - Action Letter , 1985 WL 55644 ( Oct . 25 , 1985 , publicly available Nov . 25 , 1985 ) . 396 7 HAZEN , supra note 48 , at 30 . 397 LEMKE & LINS , supra note 363 , at 10 . 398 See Missouri Innovation Center , Inc . , SEC No - Action Letter , 1995 WL 643949 ( Oct . 17 , 1995 ) ; Investex Investment Exchange Inc . , SEC No - Action Letter , Fed .

In its response to Venture Capital Network , Inc . , 399 the staff indicated that a matching network was issuing analyses or reports concerning securities when it “represents that , on the basis of the investors ' responses to the questionnaire drawn up by VCN and the information provided by the entrepreneurs in response to questionnaires drawn up by VCN , the information provided by VCN concerns an investment opportunity in a company or companies which satisfy the investors ' indicated investment criteria . " 400 Crowdfunding sites do not ordinarily do that , but , given the limited discussion , it is unclear if that is enough to keep them from being investment advisers . 6 . The Publisher Exception Section 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) of the Investment Advisers Act contains , in addition to the general definition , several exceptions—persons that are not investment advisers even if they fall within the general definition . Only one of those exceptions , the subsection ( D ) exception for “the publisher of any bona fide newspaper , news magazine or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation , ” 401 has any potential application to crowdfunding sites . However , it is unclear if this exception would apply . Although the exception covers “publications , ” it is “clear that the exclusion for publishers is not limited to publications or paper media . ” 402 It has been applied to Web sites , 403 Internet postings , 404 electronic messages , 405 and a private video information network . 406 Thus , the subsection ( D ) exception could potentially apply to crowdfunding sites . The United States Supreme Court outlined the parameters of the subsection ( D ) exclusion in 1985 in Lowe v .

The publication must ( 1 ) offer only impersonalized advice , i . e . , advice not tailored to the individual needs of a specific client or group of clients ; ( 2 ) be ‘bona fide’ or genuine , in that it contains disinterested commentary and analysis as opposed to promotional material ; and ( 3 ) be of general and regular circulation , i . e . , not timed to specific market activity or to events affecting or having the ability to affect the securities industry . 412 Crowdfunding sites clearly do not offer personalized investment advice . Everyone who enters a publicly available crowdfunding site receives exactly the same information . In fact , unlike most of the electronic matching services , most crowdfunding sites do not even attempt to collect information about investors that would allow them to match investors to particular offerings . Therefore , crowdfunding sites would fall within the publisher exception if they are “bona fide” and “of general and regular circulation . ” 413 These two requirements , according to Lowe , are designed to eliminate “hit and run tipsters” and “touts” from using the exception . 414 According to the Court , the exception is intended for publications that “contain disinterested commentary and analysis as opposed to promotional material disseminated by a ‘tout . ’” 415 Crowdfunding sites are not designed to tout particular stocks ; they are open to any entrepreneur who wishes to raise money and the sites do not attempt to promote particular issues . Moreover , they are not “personal communications masquerading in the clothing of” general publications . 416 Everyone receives exactly the same content . 409 Id . , at 208 . Prior to Lowe , courts made no distinction between personal and impersonal investment advice in applying subsection ( D ) . Lani M . Lee , The Effects of Lowe on the Application of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to Impersonal Investment Advisory Publications , 42 BUS . LAW . 507 ( 1987 ) 410 Lowe might be interpreted to require that one offer personalized advice to be an investment adviser at all , but the majority opinion clearly indicates that “on its face , the basic definition applies to petitioners . ” 472 U . S . at 203 - 204 . Thus , the better reading is that the distinction between personalized and impersonal advice relates to the publisher exception . David B .

One district court opinion has essentially read the “bona fide” requirement out of the Lowe opinion , holding that publications that did not offer individualized advice were not investment advisers even though they “do not contain completely disinterested commentary , and do contain promotional material . ” 418 And another district court held that a magazine was a bona fide publication that fit within the exception even though much of the magazine’s content was provided by featured companies and their public relations agents . 419 To fall within the publisher exception , crowdfunding sites must also be of general and regular circulation . Web sites are , by definition , continually published and crowdfunding sites are open to the general public . But the Supreme Court indicated that a publication is not regular if its publication is “timed to specific market activity , or to events affecting or having the ability to affect the securities industry . ” 420 It is not clear exactly what this means in the context of a web site . Although crowdfunding sites are continually available , they are changed each time an entrepreneur posts a new fundraising request . Thus , in a sense , each “new edition” of the site is timed to specific market activity—a new securities offering by an entrepreneur . The SEC might seize on this to argue that crowdfunding sites are not regularly published , and therefore do not qualify for the exception . V . Proposals to Exempt Crowdfunding As crowdfunding has exploded in the last few years , proponents of crowdfunding have , not surprisingly , turned their attention to federal securities law and the possibility of selling securities through crowdfunding . At least three different proposals to exempt crowdfunding from Securities Act registration have been presented in the last two years . 417 See SEC v . Laurins , 930 F . 2d 920 ( Table ) , Memorandum opinion available at 1991 WL 57933 , at * 2 ( 9th Cir . Apr . 16 , 1991 ) ( where the publisher of an investment report had an undisclosed pecuniary interest in the advice contained in the report , the publication was not bona fide , and the publisher therefore was an investment adviser ) ; SEC v . Park , 99 F . Supp . 2d 889 ( N . D . Illinois 2000 ) ( publication may not be bona fide , and therefore may not be entitled to the publisher exception , where the defendants were promoting stocks “in which they either had an interest or for which they were being paid to recommend without revealing their interests” ) . 418 SEC v . Terry’s Tips , Inc . 409 F . Supp . 2d 526 , 532 ( D . Vt . 2006 ) .

Aug . 10 , 1984 ) . 420 Id . , at 209 . 55 These proposals differ in important ways , but they all share two common features : ( 1 ) an overall cap on the dollar amount of the offering ; and ( 2 ) a limit on the amount each investor may invest . All three proposals also are fairly sketchy . They lack the full detail necessary for an actual exemption ; at best , they represent only bare frames on which an exemption could be erected . Exemption proposals come and go , so the existence of these three proposals should not unduly raise the hopes of crowdfunders . But the SEC , under pressure from Congress , has agreed to review regulatory burdens on small business capital formation and , more specifically , crowdfunding itself . A . The Sustainable Economies Law Center Petition On July 1 , 2010 , the Sustainable Economies Law Center petitioned the SEC to exempt from the Securities Act registration requirements offerings of up to $ 100 , 000 , provided that no single investor contributed more than $ 100 . 421 The proposed exemption includes additional limitations : ( 1 ) the offerors must be individual U . S residents , not entities ; ( 2 ) each offeror may make only one offering at a time ; and ( 3 ) all offering materials and communications must include a disclaimer “stating the possibility of total loss of the investment , and the necessity of careful evaluation of each offeror’s trustworthiness . ” 422 The petition itself is an illustration of the power of crowdfunding ; it was funded by a campaign on the crowdfunding web site , IndieGoGo . 423 The Center’s petition argued that the registration requirements “impose considerable hurdles” on “low - budget creative ventures” 424 and that the proposed exemption could be “a powerful source of grassroots and local funding for developing small businesses . ” 425 The petition pointed to existing crowdfunding ventures , and argued that allowing crowdfunders to receive a financial participation in the ventures they funded would make these sites “even richer sources of innovation and capital formation . ” 426 The petition argued that the $ 100 individual investment limit prevented investors “from incurring significant financial risk” because “ [ e ] ven a total loss of $ 100 is unlikely to be financially crippling for anyone . ” 427 Further , the required disclaimer would ensure that investors were aware of this risk . 428 The Center also argued that allowing only individuals , and not companies , to use the exemption would limit fraud because the 421 Request for Rulemaking to Exempt Securities Offerings Up to $ 100 , 000 With $ 100 Maximum Per Investor From Registration , SEC , File No . 4 - 605 , available at http : / / www . sec . gov / rules / petitions . shtml ( last modified June 7 , 2011 ) . 422 Id . , at 7 . 423 See Crowdfunding Campaign to Change Crowdfunding Law , INDIEGOGO , http : / / www . indiegogo . com / Change - Crowdfunding - Law ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) ; Lawton & Marom , supra note 3 , at 187 - 188 . 424 Id . , at 1 . 425 Id . , at 2 . 426 Id . , at 3 - 4 . 427 Id . , at 7 . 428 Id . 56 identity of each offeror could be verified and no one could “hide behind a corporate shell . ” 429 The SEC dutifully logged the petition 430 and began accepting comments . Aided by a mention on the BoingBoing blog , 431 the petition has generated dozens of individual comments , almost all supportive , and almost a hundred comments on a form letter . 432 The petition even has its own web site . 433 Moreover , the final report of the most recent Annual SEC Government - Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation recommended an exemption like this , although the recommendation does not specifically name the Center . 434 B . The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council Petition Near the end of 2010 , the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council proposed a similar exemption . 435 The Council’s exemption was also included in , but not directly endorsed by , the final report of the most recent Annual SEC Government - Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation . 436 The Council’s proposal , like the SELC proposal , would limit both the maximum amount of the offering and the maximum investment by any one individual . The maximum offering amount would be $ 1 million and the maximum for any individual investor would be either $ 10 , 000 or 10 % of the person’s prior year “stated income . ” 437 It is not clear from the proposal exactly what “stated income” means or whether the individual limit is the greater or the lesser of the two amounts . 429 Id . 430 See Request for Rulemaking to Exempt Securities Offerings Up to $ 100 , 000 With $ 100 Maximum Per Investor From Registration , SEC , File No . 4 - 605 , available at http : / / www . sec . gov / rules / petitions . shtml ( last update June 7 , 2011 ) . 431 See Paul Spinrad .

The Council’s proposal is not as complete an exemption as the SELC proposal . Although the Council’s letter is sketchy , its proposed exemption would apparently require the company to provide disclosure on something similar to the Small Company Offering Registration ( SCOR ) form used by the states . 439 Finally , the Council proposes that the SEC allow the creation of sites where offerors and investors making such offerings can be matched . 440 The Council , like the SELC , pointed to the rise of micro - finance sites 441 and argued that the current law stifles “all but a select few” startups , in addition to only allowing “the super elite to participate as investors / lenders to businesses , which effectively locks out the average American from helping businesses in their own community . ” 442 The Council argued that the antifraud rules would protect investors , 443 and that , in any event , the companies that would use the proposed rule “are small enough and transparent enough to prevent fraud . ” 444 C . The Startup Exemption Proposal Recently , another group , organized by entrepreneur Sherwood Neiss , 445 has created an on - line petition if favor of a crowdfunding exemption . 446 The petition calls for a $ 1 million exemption , available only to businesses with annual gross revenues over the last three years of $ 5 million . 447 All investors would have “to complete a questionnaire to determine their aptitude to participate . . . and answer a series of disclosures” to demonstrate they have sufficient knowledge and experience to invest . 448 Unaccredited investors would not be able to invest more than $ 10 , 000 . 449 The platforms hosting these offerings would be required to register with the SEC , but would not need a broker’s 438 Id . , at 5 . 439 See id . , at 4 .

The SEC Response The SEC has not proposed a crowdfunding exemption , and the SEC has not yet officially responded to any of the exemption proposals detailed above . However , as a result of Congressional pressure , the SEC staff is at least committed to looking at the issue . On March 22 , 2011 , Congressman Darrell Issa , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , sent a seventeen - page letter to Mary Schapiro , chairman of the SEC , criticizing the SEC’s treatment of private capital formation and posing a number of questions about regulation and the capital formation process . 452 Congressman Issa’s letter , among other things , asked whether the SEC had considered creating exemptions for crowdfunding . 453 Chairman Schapiro responded to Congressman Issa on April 6 , 2011 . 454 She told Issa that she was creating a new Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies and that the SEC staff was “taking a fresh look at our rules to develop ideas for the Commission about ways to reduce the regulatory burdens on small business capital formation . ” 455 She noted the Sustainable Economies Law Center proposal for a crowdfunding exemption , 456 said the SEC staff had been discussing crowdfunding , 457 and promised a staff review of “the impact of our regulations on capital formation for small businesses , ” specifically including “the regulatory questions posed by new capital raising strategies . ” 458 Any optimism should be tempered by the SEC’s history , however . The SEC often pays lip service to the needs of small business , but it seldom acts on those concerns . 459 Its annual forum on small business has produced “repeated and strongly - worded recommendations from small business advocates to lessen the SEC’s regulatory burdens on raising capital . . . [ , but ] with rare exception . . . [ the SEC ] has turned a deaf ear to the Forum’s recommendations and concerns . ” 460 450 Exemption Framework ¶¶ 6 , 8 , Startup Exemption , supra note 447 . 451 Exemption Framework ¶ 5 , Startup Exemption , supra note 447 . 452 Letter from Darrell E .

The SEC’s Exemptive Authority The SEC clearly has the authority to exempt crowdfunding offerings from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and to exempt crowdfunding web sites from registration as brokers or investment advisers . Two separate provisions of the Securities Act would give the SEC the authority to exempt crowdfunding offerings . The Sustainable Economies Law Center argued that the SEC had the authority to enact its exemption under section 3 ( b ) of the Securities Act . 461 Section 3 ( b ) of the Securities Act 462 has long given the SEC the authority to exempt offerings of less than a specified dollar amount . That dollar amount is currently $ 5 million . 463 To authorize a section 3 ( b ) exemption , the SEC must find that “enforcement . . . with respect to such securities is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering . ” 464 The SEC has used its section 3 ( b ) authority rather extensively ; Rules 504 and 505 of Regulation D are both section 3 ( b ) exemptions , 465 as is Regulation A . 466 More recently , Congress added section 28 to the Securities Act ; section 28 authorizes the SEC to exempt “any person , security , or transaction , or any class or classes of persons , securities , or transactions , ” from any provision of the Act or associated rules . 467 Section 28 does not limit the dollar amount of any offering the SEC may choose to exempt . To use its section 28 exemptive authority , the SEC must find that “such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors . ” 468 The SEC has similar exemptive authority under the Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act . Section 36 ( a ) of the Exchange Act authorizes the SEC to “conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person , security , or transaction , or any class or classes of persons , securities , or transactions” from any provisions of the Exchange Act . 469 This would allow the SEC to exempt crowdfunding sites from the definition of brokers , and would also allow the SEC to impose conditions on that exemption . To adopt such an 461 Request for Rulemaking to Exempt Securities Offerings Up to $ 100 , 000 With $ 100 Maximum Per Investor From Registration , supra note 425 , at 8 - 9 . The Center also argued that its proposed exemption could be a safe harbor for section 4 ( 2 ) of the Securities Act , id . , at 9 , a doubtful proposition give how that provision has been interpreted . 461 Id . , at 7 . 462 Securities Act § 3 ( b ) , 15 U .

There is an exception to the SEC’s authority involving government securities and government securities brokers . Exchange Act § 36 ( b ) , 15 U . S . C . § 78mm ( b ) ( 2010 ) . That exception would not apply to crowdfunding . 60 exemption , the SEC would have to find that it “is necessary or appropriate in the public interest , and . . . consistent with the protection of investors . ” 470 The SEC also has the power to exempt investment advisers . The definition of investment adviser in section 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) of the Investment Advisers Act authorizes the SEC to exclude “other persons not within the intent of the definition . ” 471 More broadly , section 206A of the Advisers Act authorizes the SEC to “conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or transaction , or any class or classes of persons , or transactions , ” provided that the exemption “is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this Act . ” 472 VI . The Costs and Benefits of Crowdfunding A crowdfunding exemption , like any securities law exemption , involves a complicated balancing of two sometimes conflicting goals—investor protection and capital formation . 473 The SEC has long seen its mission as “investor protection in the sense of remedying information asymmetries and rooting out fraud , ” 474 but all of the SEC’s foundational statutes require it to consider , “in addition to the protection of investors , whether . . . [ the SEC’s ] . . . action will promote efficiency , competition , and capital formation . ” 475 Balancing those competing interests is the “fundamental challenge of securities regulation , ” 476 and , generally , the SEC strikes that balance in favor of investor protection . 477 A crowdfunding exemption would , without a doubt , benefit capital formation . Very small businesses , particularly startups , have a need for capital that is not being met by existing sources of funding . Securities crowdfunding would help fill that capital gap . The investor - protection consequences of a crowdfunding exemption are less clear . Small business investments are inherently risky , posing not only enhanced risks of business failure , but also of fraud and overreaching by the entrepreneurs in control of the businesses . A crowdfunding exemption would expose to those risks a general public that , 470 Exchange Act § 36 ( a ) , 15 U . S . C . § 78mm ( a ) . 471 Investment Advisers Act § 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) ( G ) , 15 U .

According to Paredes , now himself an SEC commissioner , securities regulators “have an exaggerated concern over fraud and investor losses and , at least by comparison , a dulled sensitivity to the costs of greater investor protection . ” Id . , at 1009 . 61 on the whole , lacks the financial sophistication necessary to deal with them . The structure of crowdfunding might , to some extent , ameliorate those risks , but not completely . Crowdfunding investors would still face a significant risk of loss . But some of that risk is inherent in business startups ; someone is going to bear it , with or without a crowdfunding exemption . The only way to completely eliminate it is to bar all small business financing , and the SEC is unlikely to do that . And the crowdfunding exemption proposals are structured so that losses to any single investor would be relatively small and bearable . Moreover , the public is already contributing billions of dollars through non - securities crowdfunding , and those crowdfunding investments are subject to the same risks that would affect securities crowdfunding . A securities crowdfunding exemption would , therefore , not open investors to new risks , but merely allow entrepreneurs to offer a higher return to offset those risks . The net effect on investors could be positive . A . The Effect of a Crowdfunding Exemption on Capital Formation Small businesses face a capital funding gap . 478 Some estimates indicate that the financial markets fall $ 60 billion short each year “in meeting the demand of small companies for early - stage private equity financing , ” 479 and equity capital is “widely viewed as less accessible and more costly per dollar raised for small businesses compared with large businesses . ” 480 Funding is particularly difficult for businesses seeking to raise funds in the range from roughly $ 100 , 000 to $ 5 million . 481 Early - stage entrepreneurial activity in the United States is steadily declining and the U . S . has lost is lead over other innovation - driven economies . 482 As a result , entrepreneurs with promising projects go unfunded , costing the U . S . an unknown number of jobs and innovations . 483 The small business financing problem has at least two causes . The first cause is informational inefficiency—a failure to match potential sources of capital with potential investment opportunities . 484 Even if money is available , it will go unused if the 478 Jill E .

Currently , and not surprisingly , funding tends to be geographically restricted . 485 Crowdfunding allows an entrepreneur to publish her request for funding to the world , “mak [ ing ] it . . . easier to harness spare capital and route it to those who need it most . ” 486 It also opens fundraising geographically , allowing entrepreneurs to connect with capital sources outside their local area . 487 The second , and more difficult , obstacle to small business fundraising is that the existing sources of small business financing—bank lending , venture capitalists , and angel investors—simply are not available to startups and other very small businesses . Entrepreneurs typically begin new ventures using personal funds , including savings , credit card debt , and second mortgages , and money from friends and family . 488 Those resources may , of course , be inadequate , even for seed capital . Although friends , family , and personal funds may provide some entrepreneurs with the $ 100 , 000 , or even $ 500 , 000 , that some scholars suppose , 489 the amount available from such sources may be significantly lower for other entrepreneurs . Many entrepreneurs with good ideas have little access to funds ; innovative ideas are not limited to the upper and middle classes . Other common sources of business financing are not available to small start - ups . Bank loans are one possible source of capital , but most small startups do not have the collateral , the cash flow , or the operating history to qualify for bank loans . 490 Another possible source of funds is sophisticated venture capital funds , 491 but most venture capitalists focus on companies that have passed the initial start - up phase and are seeking to grow further . 492 Less than a quarter of venture capital investments are for early - stage funding . 493 Venture capital funding is also not available in the small amounts that new companies need to raise , 494 and the problem is worsening as the average minimum amount invested by venture capital funds has increased . 495 A typical venture 485 See GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 493 ( venture capitalists ) ; SIMON C .

One source claims that the total amount of venture capital funding has also declined recently , from $ 106 billion in 2000 , to $ 40 billion in 2001 and $ 30 . 5 billion in 2007 . PARKER , supra note 485 , at 238 . 63 capital investment averages between $ 2 and $ 10 million . 496 Venture capitalists sometimes provide smaller amounts , 497 but high transaction costs usually make smaller venture capital investments impractical . 498 Venture capital investments also tend to focus on selected industries , 499 and on firms with a potential for rapid growth , 500 and venture capitalists are extremely selective , rejecting 99 % of the business plans submitted to them . 501 So - called “angel investors , ” wealthy individuals with substantial business and entrepreneurial experience , 502 are the other major possibility . They typically invest on a smaller scale than venture capital firms , 503 and they are also more willing to invest in start - up companies . 504 A typical financing round for an angel investor ranges from $ 100 , 000 to $ 2 million . 505 One source indicates that the minimum deal size for most investors in the United States is about $ 1 million , 506 but some angels may be willing to provide as little as $ 25 , 000 . 507 But angel investors , like venture capitalists , generally look for “high - growth , high - return investment opportunities , ” 508 so many small companies would not qualify . And angel investors by themselves are not currently filling the small business funding gap . 509 Crowdfunding makes new sources of capital available to small businesses . 510 It opens business investment to smaller investors who have not traditionally participated in private securities offerings . Those investors have less money to invest , so they would be willing to fund smaller business opportunities that the venture capitalists and angel investors would not touch . Crowdfunding also gives poorer entrepreneurs whose friends and family lack the wealth to provide capital somewhere else to turn to start a business . But what about the other benefits that venture capitalists and angel investors provide to small business entrepreneurs ? In addition to the capital they invest , venture capitalists and angel investors typically provide companies with managerial and monitoring 496 Ibrahim , supra note 478 , at 1416 . 497 See GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 11 ( amounts ranging from $ 250 , 000 to $ 5 million ) . 498 Dent , supra note 490 , at 1080 . 499 GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 3 . 500 Fisch , supra note 478 , at 62 ; GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 10 . 501 GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 20 ; Fisch , supra note 478 , at 20 . 502 Sjostrom , supra note 219 , at 5 . 503 Fisch , supra note 478 , at 62 ; Cable , supra note 274 , at 115 . 504 GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 10 ; Ibrahim , supra note 478 , at 1406 .

The investors who would use crowdfunding would not , in any event , have access to the other services that venture capitalists and angel investors provide . Crowdfunding is no panacea . It will not completely eliminate the capital gap , but it will help . It will open investment to new sources of capital and provide a platform that allows investors with unused capital to connect with entrepreneurs who need it . B . The Risks of Crowdfunding and Small Business Investment Crowdfunding sites make it possible for relatively unsophisticated members of the general public to invest in particularly risky ventures . Investor protection is , therefore , an important issue . Crowdfunding , properly structured , can ameliorate some , but not all , of the risk , but investments in small businesses , whether or not those investments are facilitated through crowdfunding , are inherently risky . Crowdfunding investors will often lose money . However , at the margin , the cost to investors of a crowdfunding exemption is likely to be low . Investors are already contributing substantial amounts of money to unregulated crowdfunding offerings , although not for securities . Those crowdfunding investments are subject to the same risk of loss as crowdfunded securities , but do not offer the upside potential of a securities investment . Allowing crowdfunding entrepreneurs to sell securities would , therefore , be a net gain to investors , increasing the possibility of gains without any increase in the risk . Investors could actually be better off with a crowdfunding exemption . 1 . The Risks of Investing in Small Businesses As previously discussed , crowdfunding provides a source of capital for entrepreneurs who want to start small businesses or fund other small profit - making opportunities . Those small businesses are particularly risky for investors . For one thing , small businesses pose a disproportionate risk of fraud . 513 The abuses in the penny stock market in the 1980s “typify the securities fraud potential associated with direct marketing of microcap securities to individual investors . ” 514 The SEC’s experience in the 1990s when it eased the requirements of the Rule 504 small offering exemption may be instructive . In New York , which has no state registration requirement , “Rule 504 was . . . used by nefarious promoters to distribute up to $ 1 million of securities in New York to a select favored group , followed promptly by boiler - room promotions that 511 PARKER , supra note 485 , at 239 - 240 ; Fisch , supra note 478 , at 84 ; Ibrahim , supra note 478 , at 1419 ; GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 11 . 512 Fisch , supra note 478 , at 86 . 513 Fisch , supra note 478 , at 58 ; Sjostrom , supra note 213 , at 586 . 514 Fisch , supra note 478 , at 82 . 65 artificially drove up the secondary market price until such time as the initial purchasers could sell their shares at a handsome profit , leaving the gullible crop of new investors with suddenly deflated shares and irrecoverable losses . ” 515 Even absent fraud , investors in small businesses must deal with potential agency costs and problems of opportunism that arise from uncertainty and information asymmetry . 516 Uncertainty is inherent in start - up businesses . At the time of investment , “virtually all of the important decisions bearing on the company’s success remain to be made , and most of the significant uncertainties concerning the outcome of the company’s efforts remain unresolved . ” 517 The entrepreneur will typically have a business plan laying out a strategy but , at the start - up phase , that plan is little more than a “best guess . ” 518 Major strategic decisions remain to be made 519 by a management whose quality is unknown to investors . 520 The entrepreneur’s intentions and abilities are “not easily observable by an investor and difficult for an entrepreneur to communicate credibly . ” 521 In the case of high - technology companies , there may also be uncertainty about the technology itself , which the entrepreneur is almost certain to understand better than most investors . 522 In short , the entrepreneur holds all the cards . Investors have little information about what is to come and little control over what the entrepreneur does . This presents the opportunities for self - dealing , excessive compensation , misuse of corporate opportunities , and dilution of investors’ interests with which all students of closely - held businesses are familiar . 523 Sophisticated venture capital funds deal with these problems by negotiating control rights and negative covenants prohibiting the company from taking certain actions without the approval of investors . 524 Staged financing complements these protections . 525 Entrepreneurs and investors “recognize that the company will need additional rounds of financing” requiring the cooperation of the venture capitalists . 526 This need for future funding constrains the entrepreneur . Most crowdfunding investors will not have the sophistication to negotiate for control rights or protective covenants . Even if they were sophisticated enough to desire such protection , it’s not clear how they would negotiate for it , or whether it would be worth 515 SEC , Revision of Rule 504 of Regulation D , the “Seed Capital” Exemption , Securities Act Release No . 7644 , 1999 WL 95490 , at * 2 ( Feb . 25 , 1999 ) , ; Cohn & Yadley , supra note 21 , at 71 . 516 Ronald J .

The small amount invested by each crowdfunding investor and the remote , impersonal nature of the crowdfunding setting preclude any meaningful negotiations . 527 Finally , even in the absence of fraud or self - dealing , many crowdfunded small businesses will simply fail . The small start - ups to whom crowdfunding appeals pose a disproportionate risk of business failure . 528 Approximately 80 % of new businesses “either fail or no longer exist within five to seven years of formation . ” 529 Even the small businesses selected by sophisticated venture capital funds are predominantly failures : one - third of those companies end up in bankruptcy ; another third meet their expenses but are unable to go public or pay significant dividends . 530 Unsophisticated crowdfunding investors are unlikely to do as well . Investors in start - ups also face a liquidity risk ; there is no ready public resale market for their investments . 531 Crowdfunding sites will not provide such a trading market ; if they do , they might have to register as exchanges or alternative trading systems . 532 Therefore , investors may have to wait quite a while to realize any return . 533 Crowdfunding sites often require repayment within a few years . 534 That limits the illiquidity problem , but it may exacerbate the risk of failure . Entrepreneurs may be forced to repay investments before their business has developed sufficiently to do so . And , if start - ups take a while to become profitable , the short repayment periods may preclude much profit - sharing . 2 . The Financial Sophistication of the Crowd The risks associated with crowdfunding ventures might not be a major concern if crowdfunding investors were sophisticated enough to understand , control , and price those risks . But crowdfunding is open to the general public , and the available evidence shows that many members of “the crowd” are not that well - informed financially . 535 Asked to 527 " From a general perspective , crowdfunding practices raise questions with respect to corporate governance and investor protection issues if most individuals only invested tiny amounts . Crowdfunders are most likely offered very little investor protection . This may lead to corporate governance issues , which in turn may turn into reputation concerns if some cases of fraud or bad governance are uncovered . Crowdfunders have very little scope to intervene to protect their interests as stakeholders . Moreover , the fact that their investment is small is likely to create a lack of incentive to intervene . ” Belleflamme , et al , supra note 13 , at 26 . 528 Sjostrom , supra note 213 , at 586 ; Fisch , supra note 478 , at 58 ; Friedman , supra note 283 , at 306 . 529 GAO Report , supra note 213 , at 19 . 530 Dent , supra note 490 , at 1034 .

Only one - third of the respondents were able to correctly answer all three questions . 544 This financial ignorance extends beyond general principles of finance to more specific questions about economic facts . In a 2001 survey , only 52 % of the respondents knew that mutual funds do not pay a guaranteed rate of return , only 33 % knew that not all investment products purchased at a bank are federally insured , and only 56 % knew that , over the long term , stocks offer the highest rate of return . 545 In a 1993 survey of adults aged 29 - 47 , people’s estimates of current economic conditions—including the Dow Jones average , the rates of unemployment and inflation , and the amount of federal debt—were considerably off the mark . 546 Still , the numbers are not totally disheartening . A large percentage of American adults do get many basic financial literacy questions right . 547 And , in one recent survey , two - thirds of the respondents correctly answered basic questions about the function of stock markets , mutual funds , diversification , and risk . 548 However , these respondents were relatively highly educated and wealthy , so the results probably “overstate the level of financial literacy in the general population . ” 549 The precise numbers are irrelevant , however . It is clear that a significant portion of the American public lacks basic financial literacy . Since crowdfunding sites are usually open to the general public , at least some of the people investing in crowdfunding offerings will not have the basic financial capability to understand the risks . 3 . Crowdfunding and Small Business Investment Risk The way in which crowdfunding is structured may reduce some of these risks , but it is unlikely to eliminate them . Consider first the effect of crowdfunding on the risk of fraud . No matter how the exemption is structured , there will be fraud . “ [ N ] o amount of 544 See Lusardi , supra note 535 , at 4 - 6 . Here are the questions : 1 ) Suppose you had $ 100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2 % per year . After 5 years , how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow : more than $ 102 , exactly $ 102 , less than $ 102 ? 2 ) Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1 % per year and inflation was 2 % per year . After 1 year , would you be able to buy more than , exactly the same as , or less than today with the money in this account ? 3 ) Do you think that the following statement is true or false ? “Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund . ” Id . , at 5 . 545 See Hilgert , et al , supra note 535 , at 313 . 546 Nearly two - thirds of the respondents could not guess the level of the Dow Jones average , and the median answer of those who did was almost 10 % off . The median estimate of the level of the unemployment rate was 8 % ; at the time , it was 6 . 7 % . The median estimate of the inflation rate was 4 % ; the actual rate was 2 . 8 % . The median estimate of the federal debt was $ 3 trillion ; it was actually $ 4 . 4 trillion at the time . Bernheim , supra note 535 , at 44 . 547 See Lusardi & Mitchell , supra note 535 , at 6 , 21 . 548 See Lusardi , supra note 535 , at 8 - 9 , 26 . 549 Lusardi & Mitchell , supra note 535 , at 5 . 69 exemption requirements will hinder the fraud artists from their endeavors . ” 550 But , of course , registration itself does not eliminate fraud . The question is whether Internet - based crowdfunding will encourage or inhibit fraud , and by how much . Paul Spinrad , the originator of the crowdfunding petition , argues that , because of the small amounts involved and the open , public nature of crowdfunding , fraudsters would not find it appealing . 551 It is not clear if that is true . On the one hand , the Internet allows fraudulent offerings to be distributed widely at low cost . 552 Crowdfunding sites are an obvious target for fraudsters . On the other hand , fraud is “more detectable on the Internet , 553 especially when it must be mediated through an independent crowdfunding site . Moreover , the absence of personal face - to - face interaction may make it more difficult to convince investors to invest in fraudulent offerings . 554 The net effect is indeterminate . However , it is important to remember that a crowdfunding exemption would not legitimize fraud or protect fraudulent offerings from the securities statutes’ antifraud rules . The SEC and private parties would still have the usual remedies for any fraud . The crowdfunding structure does have some features that could help limit some of the risks of investing in small business ventures . First , crowdfunding sometimes involved staged financing . 555 The need to come back for future financing could temper entrepreneur behavior , especially if prior - round investors are able to publicly communicate on the crowdfunding site about any problems they have had . Second , investors could use crowdfunding discussion boards to point out problems with the proposed deals , to coax concessions from entrepreneurs prior to investing , and to monitor investments after they invest . Lenders on peer - to - peer lending sites “have shown a remarkable propensity to shoulder the burden of monitoring underlying debts . ” Web forums and message boards are replete with the adventures of P2P lender qua detective , ferreting out fraud that had been overlooked by the platform . ” 556 It is at least possible that crowdfunding investors will do a better job compared to venture capitalists and angel investors than their relative sophistication would predict . 557 The 550 Cohn & Yadley , supra note 21 , at 72 . 551 Scott Shane , Let the Crowd Buy Equity in Private Companies , Bloomberg Businessweek , http : / / www . businessweek . com / smallbiz / content / may2011 / sb2011052 _ 710243 . htm ( May 3 , 2011 ) . 552 Fisch , supra note 478 , at 58 . 553 Fisch , supra note 478 , at 81 . 554 See Fisch , supra note 478 , at 78 . 555 See , e . g . , Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQs ) , INDIEGOGO , http : / / www . indiegogo . com / about / faqs ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) ( To continue fundraising after a campaign closes , just start a new campaign ) ; Creating a Project , KICKSTARTER , http : / / www . kickstarter . com / help / faq / creating % 20a % 20project ( under heading “Starting a Project” ) ( projects can be split into stages , but it is not recommended ) .

Venture capital funds and angel investors are highly selective , and venture capitalists especially tend to focus on larger , high - growth companies that are past the start - up phase . See text accompanying notes 491 - 501 , supra . Crowdfunding sites appeal to entrepreneurs who cannot otherwise obtain funds—those , in other words , who could not attract funding from venture capitalists and angel investors . Even if crowdfunding investors are better at 70 knowledge gap that once separated professionals from others has shrunk as information has become more readily accessible through the Internet , 558 and crowdfunding investors are , by definition , comfortable using the Internet . More importantly , expertise does not necessarily translate into success ; experts are often extraordinarily bad , on average , at predicting the future . 559 The lesson of crowd - sourcing is that a diverse group of less expert decision - makers can often make better choices than those with expertise . 560 Crowdfunding , under the right conditions , could benefit from what James Surowiecki calls “the wisdom of crowds , ” 561 the notion that “even if most of the people within a group are not especially well - informed or rational , . . . [ the group ] . . . can still reach a collectively wise decision . ” 562 There may also be a learning effect in crowdfunding . 563 A study of lenders on Prosper . com found that , over the two - year period studied , lenders moved from lower - performing loans to loans with a higher rate of return . 564 However , crowdfunding is still relatively young ; until we have more experience , we should be cautious about predicting its success in protecting investors from risk . The investors on crowdfunding sites , like investors in small businesses generally and even sophisticated venture capitalists , will undoubtedly suffer significant losses . 565 Fraudsters will use crowdfunding sites to deceive investors and take their money . Entrepreneurs will take advantage of their control to benefit themselves at the expense of outside investors . Unsophisticated investors will make ill - advised investments . But the proposed crowdfunding exemptions are structured so that none of those losses will be catastrophic to individual investors . Each of the proposed exemptions limits the maximum amount a single investor may contribute and therefore limits each person’s possible loss to a tolerable amount . 566 Finally , the relevant question is not whether there will be fraud or losses to investors if we exempt securities crowdfunding . The question is whether and how much exempting securities crowdfunding will increase investor losses . Investors are already investing substantial amounts in non - securities crowdfunding . Those investments are as risky as securities crowdfunding . People who make pure donations to entrepreneurs are guaranteed to “lose” all of their money and receive nothing in return . People who discriminating among available investments , they are picking from a different , more risky pool than venture capitalists and angel investors . 558 See Howe , supra note 2 , at 39 - 40 . 559 See DAN GARDNER , FUTURE BABBLE : WHY EXPERT PREDICTIONS ARE NEXT TO WORTHLESS ( 2011 ) . James Suroweicki quotes Wharton professor J . Scott Armstrong , who survey expert forecasts and analyses in a number of fields and concluded , “I could find no studies that showed an important advantage for expertise . ” Surowiecki , supra note 140 , at 33 . 560 See Howe , supra note 2 , at 131 - 145 . 561 See Surowiecki , supra note 140 . 562 Surowiecki , supra note 140 , at xiii . 563 See Seth Freedman & Ginger Zhe Jin , Do Social Networks Solve Information Problems for Peer - to - Peer Lending ?

People who make no - interest loans on Kiva may never get their money back . The risk of fraud or self - dealing is the same in non - securities crowdfunding as in securities crowdfunding . The gain to the fraudster or the self - dealing entrepreneur depends on the amount invested , not on the type of return offered to the investors . A $ 1 , 000 contribution provides the same opportunity for diversion whether it’s for a non - interest loan on Kiva , a pre - purchase on Kickstarter , or a purchase of stock on a securities crowdfunding site . Security or not , the risk to the crowdfunding investor is exactly the same . 567 Securities crowdfunding does , however , increase the potential gains to investors . Instead of making a donation or settling for some reward , investors in crowdfunded securities can receive interest or a share of the entrepreneur’s profits . As discussed earlier , there is a serious risk they will not receive the promised return , but even the possibility of interest or profit is better than no financial return at all . Since the downside is the same as the status quo and the upside is superior , an exemption allowing securities crowdfunding could make investors better off . VII . A Crowdfunding Exemption Proposal The discussion to this point has shown that a properly structured crowdfunding exemption could be beneficial , but how exactly should that exemption be structured ? What limits should be imposed on crowdfunding offerings and , just as important , what limits should be imposed on the web sites that facilitate those offerings ? I discuss the restrictions on crowdfunding offerings in subsection A and the restrictions on crowdfunding sites in subsection B , but , before beginning that discussion , a general comment is in order . The locus of any regulation should be the crowdfunding sites , not the entrepreneurs making the offerings . Any crowdfunding exemption should use those intermediaries as gatekeepers to enforce any regulatory requirements , and should not impose any complicated requirements at the entrepreneurial level . The small companies and entrepreneurs most likely to engage in crowdfunding are poorly capitalized and legally unsophisticated . They do not have and cannot afford sophisticated securities counsel to guide them through a labyrinth of complex regulation . The cost of counsel could easily exceed the value of the offering . Complicated regulatory requirements ( like the general solicitation restrictions in Regulation A or the restrictions on communications applicable to registered offerings ) are likely to produce numerous unintended violations . Too much complexity at the entrepreneurial level will , therefore , destroy the exemption’s utility . 567 This does not mean investors’ total losses will stay the same if a crowdfunding exemption is adopted . If entrepreneurs are allowed to sell securities on crowdfunding sites , the promise of greater returns might attract more investors , increasing the total amount of money invested through crowdfunding . Even if the proportionate loss is the same , the total loss would be greater simply because more money would be invested . 72 Crowdfunding sites , on the other hand , are repeat players . They can spread any regulatory costs over a large number of offerings . They are undoubtedly more heavily capitalized than the entrepreneurs using their sites , and can afford securities counsel . Crowdfunding sites are also much more visible to the SEC for regulatory enforcement purposes . Any conditions needed to protect investors should be imposed at the site level . This does not mean that restrictions cannot be placed on the offerings themselves or on the companies making the offerings , just that such restrictions must be enforceable at the site level . A restriction on the dollar amount of crowdfunding offerings , for example , is something that a crowdfunding site can easily monitor and enforce , since the money flows through the site . But anything that turns on what the entrepreneur is doing off - site is not as easily monitored . For example , if the available amount is affected by fundraising the entrepreneur does off - site , there is no effective way for the site to enforce the limit . A . Restrictions on the Offering The dollar amount of offerings qualifying for the crowdfunding exemption should be limited , as should the amount that any single investor may invest . It is not clear what the exact amounts of those limits should be ; there is no magic number . An annual offering limit of around $ 250 , 000 and an annual limit on individual contributions of $ 500 seem sensible . Integration and aggregation concepts should not be applied to the offering limit . A limit on the size of companies eligible to engage in crowdfunding offerings is not necessary but , if the SEC believes such a limit is appropriate , a restriction to non - reporting companies would do little damage . These crowdfunded offerings should be exempted only if they are made through a crowdfunding site that meets the requirements specified in subsection B . 1 . Restriction on the Size of the Offering I have explained in a previous article why an unconditional exemption from registration for smaller offerings makes sense . 568 I will not repeat that argument in detail here . The argument for such a Securities Act exemption is just a specific case of the more general economic argument for small business exemptions . 569 The cost to register a relatively small offering exceeds any benefit that registration could provide . 570 This is true even if fraud is more likely in smaller offerings ; although the likelihood of fraud affects the dollar amount below which offerings should be exempted , it does not affect the case for such an exemption . 571 Economies of scale make registration inefficient for smaller offerings , even if registration creates a net benefit for larger offerings . 572 568 See C . Steven Bradford , Securities Regulation and Small Business : Rule 504 and the Case for an Unconditional Exemption , 5 J . SMALL & EMERGING BUS . LAW 1 ( 2001 ) . 569 See C . Steven Bradford , Does Size Matter ? An Economic Analysis of Small Business Exemptions from Regulation , 8 J . SMALL & EMERGING BUS . LAW 1 ( 2004 ) . 570 See Bradford , supra note 568 , at 29 - 33 . 571 Assume , for example , that the average loss in smaller offerings for all reasons , including fraud , is 60 % of the amount invested . Make the heroic assumption that registration would prevent all those losses . If the total cost of registering a $ 100 , 000 offering is $ 70 , 000 , it still makes sense to exempt such offerings . In the absence of registration , the average loss will be $ 60 , 000 , but registration imposes an even greater cost , 73 Consider , for example , an attempt to raise $ 20 , 000 . The maximum amount investors could lose in that offering is $ 20 , 000 . Even if registration could reduce the probability of any loss to zero , the maximum possible benefit of registration is only $ 20 , 000 . The cost of registration clearly exceeds $ 20 , 000 , so the cost of registration exceeds its benefit . Offerings of this amount should be exempted . The case for a small offering exemption is clear . Less clear is what the dollar limit on such an exemption should be—the level at which registration ceases to be cost - effective . The crowdfunding exemption proposals include offering caps ranging from $ 100 , 000 to $ 1 million . 573 Heminway and Hoffman propose a limit in the $ 100 , 000 to $ 250 , 000 range . 574 There is no magic number . Given the cost of registering an offering , 575 the case for exempting offerings of $ 500 , 000 or less seems reasonably clear ; moving beyond that requires more exact measurements of the cost of registration , the risk of loss , and how much registration reduces that risk . 576 If the exemption is capped at $ 250 , 000 , the cost - benefit tradeoff is hard to dispute . The crowdfunding exemption proposals add additional elements that might justify a higher limit . First , my proposed crowdfunding exemption will limit not just the dollar amount of the offering , but also the amount that each individual investor may invest , reducing the possibility that individual investors will suffer a major loss . 577 Second , under my proposed exemption , offerings may be made only through crowdfunding sites that meet certain requirements that increase investor protection . 578 Each of those limits makes the proposed exemption more favorable to investors than an unconditional exemption with the same dollar amount limit . 2 . Aggregation / Integration Any proposal for a Securities Act exemption must deal with the frustrating problem of integration—whether two offerings that are ostensibly separate should be treated as part of the same offering , with the possible resulting loss of the exemption . 579 The integration doctrine was developed by the SEC “to prevent issuers from artificially dividing a single , non - exempt offering into two or more parts in an attempt to obtain an exemption from one or more of the parts . ” 580 Unfortunately , the integration doctrine is an uncertain , confusing mess . 581 Scholars have proposed its elimination 582 or substantial $ 70 , 000 . Society is better off exempting such offerings . See Bradford , supra note 568 , at 39 - 47 ( calculating the optimal exemption amount , given various assumptions about fixed costs , the proportion of losses , and the proportion of losses prevented by registration ) . 572 See Bradford , supra note 568 , at 24 - 27 . See generally Bradford , supra note 569 , at 5 - 15 . 573 See Section V , supra . 574 See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 60 . 575 See Section III .

REV . 465 , 473 ( 1979 ) . 581 See Bradford , supra note 473 , at 651 - 652 . 74 modification ; 583 the SEC itself has created several safe harbors that protect against application of the doctrine . 584 Even if two offerings are not integrated , the related concept of aggregation can be problematic . The aggregation provisions in Regulation A and Rules 504 and 505 of Regulation D reduce the maximum amounts available under those exemptions by the amount of certain other offerings . 585 The $ 1 million exemption amount available under Rule 504 would , for instance , be reduced if the issuer had completed a Regulation A offering in the prior twelve months . 586 The dollar limit suggested in the previous subsection should be applied on an aggregate basis to all crowdfunding offerings by the same issuer in that year . If the annual limit is $ 500 , 000 , the total an entrepreneur raises through crowdfunding should not exceed $ 500 , 000 in a year , even if the entrepreneur conducts several , separate rounds of fundraising . This is consistent with the SEC’s approach in Regulation A . Rule 251 ( b ) limits the offering amount in Regulation A offerings to no more than $ 5 million in any 12 - month period ; only offerings pursuant to Regulation A are counted against that limit . 587 Other exemptions with dollar limits use a similar 12 - month period , although the amounts charged against those limits include other specified offerings . 588 As with Regulation A , only offerings pursuant to the crowdfunding exemption itself should count against the annual dollar limit . Concepts of integration and aggregation should not be applied beyond that , for two reasons . First , small business entrepreneurs seeking to raise money through crowdfunding cannot afford the legal expertise needed to apply the integration doctrine . They can count how much money they receive through crowdfunding , but they are not in a position to consider the effect of other fundraising efforts on the availability of crowdfunding— whether , for example , the private solicitation of money from Aunt Agnes will count against the crowdfunding limit . 589 They also cannot foresee what their future capital 582 See Rutheford B .

It 75 needs will be and anticipate the possible retroactive application of integration to destroy their crowdfunding exemption . Smaller companies’ capital needs “are often sporadic and immediate , ” 590 making it impossible for entrepreneurs to anticipate future non - crowdfunding offerings . The possible application of integration concepts could make those subsequent offerings problematic . Second , integrating or aggregating outside offerings with crowdfunding offerings is inconsistent with the idea of crowdfunding sites as gatekeepers . Crowdfunding sites can verify how much each entrepreneur has raised through crowdfunding ; the money passes through their portal . They cannot easily ascertain how much entrepreneurs have raised through other , outside sources . 3 . Size of an Individual Investment All of the crowdfunding exemption proposals limit not only the total amount of the crowdfunding offering , but also the amount that any investor may invest . A per - investor limit is sensible . Small business offerings are very risky and losses are likely . 591 A cap on the amount each person may invest eliminates the possibility of catastrophic loss and , if the amount is appropriate , limits losses to what each investor can bear . a . The Individual Cap Related to Existing Exemptions Other federal offering exemptions are not so protective . Many of them limit the total dollar amount of the offering , but none of them limit the amount that any investor may invest . The maximum offering amount is $ 5 million for Regulation A , 592 $ 1 million under Rule 504 of Regulation D , 593 and $ 5 million under Rule 505 . 594 However , as long as the entire offering does not exceed the cap , it does not matter how much any investor purchases . The exemption would be available even if a single investor purchased the entire offering . A single investor could invest all his assets in a very risky Rule 504 offering , and , in spite of the possible devastating effect of a loss , the exemption would still be available . However , the idea of exemptions based on investors’ ability to bear losses is not totally novel to federal securities law . Both Rule 506 of Regulation D and section 4 ( 5 ) of the Securities Act incorporate this basic idea . Rule 506 , a safe harbor for the section 4 ( 2 ) exemption for private offerings , limits sales to purchasers who either are accredited investors or who have “such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that . . . [ they are ] . . . capable of evaluating is likely Chang never even considered whether his subsequent offering negatively affected the status of his earlier Rule 504 “private raise . ” 590 See Cohn & Yadley , supra note 21 , at 50 . 591 See Section VI . B . 1 , supra . 592 Rule 251 ( b ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 251 ( b ) . No more than $ 1 . 5 million of that amount may be offered by sellers other than the issuer .

R . § 230 . 505 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( i ) . 76 the merits and risks of the prospective investment . ” 595 The sophistication requirement is consistent with the Supreme Court’s analysis of the section 4 ( 2 ) exemption in the Ralston Purina case . Ralston Purina indicated that the availability of the section 4 ( 2 ) exemption turns on whether the class of offerees “needs the protection of the Act” or are “able to fend for themselves , ” 596 and subsequent lower court cases have focused on the sophistication of the offerees and their access to information about the issuer . 597 But Rule 506 is available even to unsophisticated investors , as long as they are accredited investors . 598 Some of the categories of accredited investors are individuals or institutions who would ordinarily be sophisticated . The definition includes , for example , registered securities brokers or dealers , registered investment companies , banks , and insurance companies . 599 Directors and executive officers of the issuer , who would ordinarily have access to information about the issuer , are also accredited investors . 600 In those cases , accredited status is merely a more objective proxy for the uncertain ideas of sophistication and access to information . But other parts of the accredited investor definition focus solely on an investor’s wealth or income . Any individual whose net worth , either alone or with a spouse , exceeds $ 1 million is accredited , 601 as are trusts , corporations , partnerships , and certain other entities with total assets in excess of $ 5 million . 602 An individual is also an accredited investor if she has had an income of $ 200 , 000 , or a joint income with her spouse of $ 300 , 000 , over the two previous years , provided she reasonably expects to reach the same income in the year of the offering . 603 Section 4 ( 5 ) of the Securities Act also exempts offerings to accredited investors , ” 604 and the SEC’s definition of accredited investor for purposes of this exemption also includes wealth - related categories : people with an individual net worth in excess of $ 1 million and people with an individual income of $ 200 , 000 or a joint income of $ 300 , 000 . 605 Many people who are accredited investors because of wealth or income have neither investment sophistication nor access to information about the issuer . 606 Consider , for 595 Rule 506 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( ii ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 506 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( ii ) .

S . 119 , 125 ( 1953 ) . 597 See 1 HAZEN , supra note 48 , at 565 . 598 Moreover , the information requirements that would otherwise apply in a Rule 506 offering do not apply to sales to accredited investors .

And he has no connection to the issuer that would give him access to information about the company . The SEC itself has been somewhat less than candid in discussing why these classes of accredited investors are included . 608 One possibility is that wealth and income are just extraordinarily imperfect proxies for sophistication and access to information , 609 but the more plausible reason for including wealthy , but unsophisticated investors is that they can afford to lose the money . 610 If that is the rationale , the existing exemptions do not fit it well . Neither section 4 ( 5 ) nor Rule 506 limit the amount any single investor may invest in the offering . 611 Thus , an individual with a net worth of only $ 1 million could invest all of his wealth in a single risky offering , and a total loss on that one investment would leave the investor penniless . And an investor whose accredited status is based solely on net income could actually be Offerings Under the Securities Act of 1933 , 33 AM . U . L .

REV . 73 , 81 ( 1981 ) ( Rule 242 , the predecessor to Regulation D , attempted to dispense subjective criteria of sophistication and access to information with more “definitive and objective standards” ) . 610 See Friedman , supra note 606 , at 299 - 300 ( the basis for making wealthy but unsophisticated investors accredited is “the ground that they can afford to lose money” ) . Edward Fletcher also seems to believe that this basis underlies the accredited investor categories . He asks , “should the law presume that wealthy investors , who can bear investment risks , are sophisticated investors , and treat them as such , no matter how financially naive they may be ? ” Fletcher , supra note 609 , at 1123 ( emphasis added ) . 611 This has not always been the case . When Regulation D was adopted , an investor was accredited if he purchased at least $ 150 , 000 of the securities being offered and the purchase price did not exceed 20 % of the purchaser’s net worth . See SEC , Revision of Certain Exemptions from Registration for Transactions Involving Limited Offers and Sales , Securities Act Release No . 6389 ( Mar . 8 , 1982 ) . See also Warren , supra note 606 , 369 ; Mohney , supra note 608 , at 135 . Presumably this 20 % floor “assures . . . [ investors ] . . . are able to bear the risk of the investment . ” Mohney , supra note 608 , at 136 . 78 insolvent at the time of purchase . 612 The proposed crowdfunding exemptions carry forward the focus on the investor’s ability to bear the loss , but in a much more coherent way . The focus is not on the proxies of wealth and income , but on the actual amount invested . b . How to Structure the Cap Unfortunately , the crowdfunding exemption proposals leave many questions unanswered . Should the limit be applied on a per - offering basis or applied cumulatively across all of a person’s crowdfunding investments ? Should it be an annual limit or a cap on the total amount of each individual’s crowdfunding investments ? Should the limit be a uniform dollar amount or a percentage of each person’s wealth or income ? And , most importantly , what should the limit be . The proposals range from $ 100 to $ 10 , 000 per person . 613 Consider first whether the investment limit should be the same amount for all investors or should vary depending on the investor’s financial circumstances . A fixed limit of , for example , $ 500 per person is simple and easy to apply . But a uniform limit , unless it is very small , does not necessarily limit all investors to an amount they can afford to lose . Many investors have very little savings or uncommitted income . 614 A loss of even $ 500 could be catastrophic to those investors . A limit tailored to the particular investor’s wealth or income would better fit the policy rationale . An individual investor might , for example , be limited to investing no more than ten percent of his net worth or no more than five percent of his annual income . But this type of limit would make the exemption more costly and difficult to administer ; either the crowdfunding site or the issuer would have to determine the investor’s income or net worth before allowing the investor to invest . And , since crowdfunding depends on small contributions from a large number of investors , the number of such income and wealth determinations could be prohibitive . And even an income - or wealth - based standard will not satisfy the policy concern in all cases . An investor whose wealth is tied up in illiquid assets and who has little free income cannot afford to lose five or ten percent of his wealth or income . The better solution is to apply a uniform limit to all investors , but make that limit low enough that most people could afford to lose it . 615 An individual investment limit of 612 See Warren , supra note 606 , at 382 . 613 See Section V , supra . 614 A 2010 survey found that 30 % of all adults had no savings ( excluding retirement savings ) .

Another survey found that fewer than half of American adults had an emergency fund that would cover expenses for three months . Applied Research & Consulting LLC , supra note 535 , at 16 . But see Hilgert , et al , supra note 535 , at 310 ( July 2003 ) ( earlier survey finding that 63 % of the respondents had some emergency fund ) . Forty - nine percent of those respondents found it difficult merely to pay all of their bills each month . Applied Research & Consulting LLC , supra note 535 , at 15 . But see Hilgert , et al , supra note 535 , at 310 ( earlier survey finding that 49 % of the respondents set aside money out of each paycheck ) . 615 If a wealth - or income - based limit is used , an investor’s self - certification should be sufficient to satisfy the requirement . A crowdfunding site or issuer should not have to establish a “reasonable belief” that the 79 between $ 250 and $ 500 is reasonable . 616 That cap should be applied to all investors . 617 This amount is more than some investors could afford to lose , but , at some point , potential investors must be trusted to decide for themselves what they can afford . 618 Whatever the limit , it should be applied to all of an individual’s crowdfunding investments in any given year , not on a per - offering basis . Otherwise , an investor could quickly invest more than he could afford to lose by investing the maximum amount in a large number of offerings - - $ 500 in offering A , $ 500 in offering B , $ 500 in offering C , and so on ad infinitum . An investment limit fits the policy argument only if it is applied on a cumulative basis . 619 The cumulative limit , however , should only include investments pursuant to the crowdfunding exemption . Other types of investments , even other securities investments , should not count against the cap . People have numerous other investments with various levels of financial risk—mutual funds , houses , cars , friends’ businesses . All of a person’s assets and liabilities are relevant in assessing the risk that a particular investment adds to the person’s portfolio , but the SEC has to draw a line somewhere . The SEC is not a general risk protection agency , and going outside the crowdfunding exemption to calculate the limit would make the exemption unworkable . The limit should also be an annual one . An investor who invests $ 500 in 2012 should be free to invest another $ 500 in 2013 , even if she still holds the 2012 investment . The investor was within the limits to avoid loss of the exemption . The exemption should be available unless the site or entrepreneur knew or should reasonably have known that the wealth / income figures furnished by the investor were incorrect . Requiring the site or the issuer to check each small investor’s figures to establish a reasonable belief would render the crowdfunding exemption unworkable . 616 See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 60 ( proposing an individual limit of $ 100 to $ 250 per offering ) ; Shane , supra note 551 ( allowing people to invest only $ 100 “doesn’t seem to impose a significant risk of financial loss on individuals” ) . The limit could be applied individually or on a household basis . An individual limit would be easier to administer because neither the site nor the issuer have to worry about identifying who belongs to the same family or household . But risk is typically borne by a household as a whole ; if one family member loses money , the entire family suffers . And the administrative cost to crowdfunding sites and entrepreneurs could be minimized by allowing investors to self - certify the amounts invested by others in their household . There is really no strong reason for preferring either one ; the dollar limit can always be adjusted to account for the individual versus family choice . If the limit is applied on an individual basis , the limit can be slightly less ; if it’s applied on a household basis , it can be slightly more . 617 Heminway and Hoffman suggest limiting any such cap to investors who are not accredited or sophisticated , and allowing accredited and sophisticated investors to invest without any limit . See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 63 . Issuers can already offer securities to accredited and sophisticated investors using Rule 506 of Regulation D . My proposal would preclude integration of any Rule 506 offerings with offerings pursuant to the crowdfunding exemption . See Section VII . A . 2 , infra . Therefore , the only thing that would preclude simultaneous , side - by - side Rule 506 and crowdfunding exemption offerings on the same web site is Regulation D’s general solicitation restriction . See text accompanying notes 239 - 241 , supra . I would prefer that the SEC eliminate the general solicitation restrictions for all Rule 506 offerings rather than carve out an exception in the crowdfunding exemption for sales to accredited and sophisticated investors . 618 This is less than some investors could afford to lose , but this is not the only exemption available for sales to wealthier investors . Above certain income or wealth levels , investors would be accredited and eligible for exemptions like Rule 506 of Regulation D . See Rule 501 ( a ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 501 ( a ) ( 2007 ) . 619 But see Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 60 ( proposing a limit of $ 100 or $ 250 “in a single offering or over a specified period” ) . 80 amount of the cap obviously should be lower for an annual limit than it would be for a cumulative limit , but an annual limit is much easier to administer . A cumulative cap would have to account for withdrawals of money , dividends , and bankruptcies , and could raise some difficult issues . If , for example , an investor loses his entire $ 500 investment , is he forever barred from again investing in crowdfunding ? He has , after all , lost the total amount we determined he could afford to lose . We might want to bar him on the theory that he is a bad investor , but given the high percentage of start - up failures , a total loss doesn’t necessarily reflect negatively on that person’s capabilities as an investor . An annual limit does not present difficult questions like this . The final question that must be addressed is who has the legal responsibility to enforce the limit—the issuer , the crowdfunding site , or the individual investor . Who , if anyone , has liability if an investor exceeds the crowdfunding individual cap ? The site or the issuer should be required to keep records of the amounts contributed by each investor and investors should be required to certify the amounts invested at all crowdfunding sites . If those records show that the investor has exceeded the cap , the exemption should not be available . But , as long as their records do not show otherwise , the site and the issuer should be allowed to rely on the investor’s self - certification . If the investor’s self - certification is false and neither the site nor the entrepreneur are aware of it , the investor should be stuck with the consequences . The law should not protect the lying investor at the expense of the innocent crowdfunding site and entrepreneur . 620 4 . Should There Be Company Size Limits ? The proposed crowdfunding exemption is designed to help very small businesses raise capital . Should larger businesses therefore be excluded from using it ? The SEC already limits the use of the Regulation A and Rule 504 exemptions to non - reporting companies , 621 and Heminway and Hoffman propose that any crowdfunding exemption be similarly limited to non - public companies . 622 The justification for small offering exemptions depends on the size of the offering , not on the size of the company making the offering , 623 so such restrictions are theoretically unnecessary . But such a limit would be relatively easy to administer and would have no dramatic effect on the use of crowdfunding . 624 Larger businesses are unlikely to use the exemption even if they are allowed to . Most large businesses are unlikely to seek external funding for such small amounts , particularly given the cost of raising such funds through $ 100 or $ 250 investments . They 620 Cf .

Ct . 2622 ( 1985 ) ( in pari delicto defense available in securities fraud actions where the plaintiff is at least equally culpable and preclusion of suit would not significantly interfere with enforcement of the securities laws and protection of the investing public ) . 621 See Rules 251 ( a ) ( 2 ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 251 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( 2007 ) ; 504 ( a ) ( 2 ) , 17 C . F . R . § 230 . 504 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( 2007 ) . 622 See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 60 . They also propose to exclude foreign issuers and investment companies . Id . 623 See text accompanying notes 568 - 572 , supra . 624 If , however , the rule’s exception is expressed in terms of a company’s total or net assets , crowdfunding sites would have to review documentation from each issuer to verify that it does not exceed the cap , and the cost of administering the restriction would be higher . 81 usually have sufficient cash to meet such small funding requirements internally . Apple Computer , for instance , had $ 11 , 261 , 000 , 000 in cash and cash equivalents at the end of its 2010 fiscal year . 625 The Buckle , Inc . , a much smaller company , reported over $ 116 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of its most recent fiscal year . 626 These companies are not going to be using a crowdfunding exemption . Larger non - reporting companies have another reason to avoid the crowdfunding exemption . Companies in the U . S . with more than $ 10 million in total assets and a class of equity security held of record by 500 or more people must register with the SEC under the Exchange Act . 627 Selling equity to a large number of investors in $ 100 or $ 250 chunks would increase the number of equity holders and could trigger Exchange Act reporting requirements . B . Restrictions on Crowdfunding Sites Offerings that fall within the limitations discussed above should be exempted only if they are sold through crowdfunding sites that meet certain standards designed to protect investors and minimize the risks of what are already risky offerings . Crowdfunding sites should be open to the general public and should provide publicly accessible communications portals that allow potential investors to communicate about each offering . Investors should be allowed to invest on those sites only after viewing a brief investor education video or quiz . Entrepreneurs posting on those sites should be required to specify a funding goal and should be allowed to close an offering only if that goal is reached . Until then , investors should be free to withdraw their commitments . Crowdfunding sites should not be allowed to recommend or rate investment opportunities , or to advise investors about those opportunities , unless they are willing to register as brokers or investment advisers . Crowdfunding sites should be allowed to operate for profit , but neither the sites nor their employees should be able to invest in any of the offerings that appear on the site . Crowdfunding sites that meet these standards and notify the SEC that they are engaged in crowdfunding should not be required to register as brokers or investment advisers unless they also engage in other activities that would make them such . 1 . Open Sites ; Open Communication Crowdfunding sites that want to take advantage of the proposed exemption should be open to the general public and should be required to provide some means , such as an electronic bulletin board , that allows investors to communicate freely and openly about each offering . These requirements will allow crowdfunding sites to take advantage of 625 Apple Inc . , Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ended Sept . 25 , 2010 , p . 47 , available at http : / / www . sec . gov / Archives / edgar / data / 320193 / 000119312510238044 / d10k . htm # tx37397 _ 2 . 626 The Buckle , Inc . , Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ended Jan . 29 , 2011 , p . 31 , available at http : / / www . sec . gov / Archives / edgar / data / 885245 / 000115752311001807 / a6663779 . htm # statements . 627 See Exchange Act § 12 ( g ) ( 1 ) ( B ) , 15 U . S . C . § 78l ( g ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( 2010 ) ( requiring the registration of companies with more than $ 1 million in total assets and 500 or more record holders of a class of equity security ) ; Rule 12g - 1 ( raising the asset amount to $ 10 million ) . 82 “the wisdom of crowds” that is the foundation of all crowd - sourcing , including crowdfunding . 628 The “soft information” conveyed through these open communication channels may compensate for the lack of “hard information” provided by the entrepreneur itself . 629 Open communication will not alleviate all , and probably not even most , of the risks associated with small businesses , but it will be beneficial . Openness will help prevent fraud by allowing investors with particular knowledge about an offering or the issuer to communicate it to everyone . Investors who are aware of a particular entrepreneur’s shady business background can communicate that knowledge to others . Investors with local knowledge of facts inconsistent with the entrepreneur’s claims can inform others . For example , if the entrepreneur claims to own a shop in North Platte , Nebraska , people in North Platte who know otherwise can tell others . Open communication has advantages other than preventing fraud . It could lead to better informed investors generally . Investors with knowledge of the particular industry or type of product can share that knowledge with other potential investors . Investors who are also potential customers can explain why the proposed product or service will or will not succeed , and can suggest modifications of the product . Investors with business or accounting expertise can point out problems in the entrepreneur’s business plan or projections . Investors with legal expertise can point out regulatory issues the entrepreneur has not considered . Not only would these communications better inform investors , they might help the entrepreneur refine his business plan . Openness like this can also lead to better monitoring after an investment is made . From an economic standpoint , it makes little sense for someone who has invested $ 100 to $ 200 to devote a substantial amount of time and effort to such monitoring . But the social aspects of crowdfunding and other crowdsourcing applications lead people to contribute inordinate amounts of time and effort to the enterprise . 630 Andrew Verstein points out that lenders on peer - to - peer lending sites “have shown a remarkable propensity to shoulder the burden of monitoring underlying debts . Web forums and message boards are replete with the adventures of P2P lender qua detective , ferreting out fraud that had been overlooked by the platform . ” 631 Open communication is not an unmitigated positive . It could also lead to group - think . Deliberative discussion “is the enemy of collective intelligence because it reduces diversity . ” 632 James Surowiecki , famous for promoting “the wisdom of crowds , ” notes that group judgment is most likely to be accurate if each person’s opinion is not 628 See James Surowiecki , supra note 140 , at 230 ( Peer monitoring is a fundamental part of the virtual world ) ; Schwienbacher & Larralde , supra note 16 , at 12 ( although crowdfunders might not have any special knowledge about the industry in which they are investment , as a crowd , they can be more efficient than a few equity investors alone ) . 629 Seth Freedman & Ginger Zhe Jin , Do Social Networks Solve Information Problems for Peer - to - Peer Lending ? Evidence From Prosper . com , at 2 ( Nov . 2008 ) , available at http : / / ssrn . com / abstract = 1304138 . 630 “In many cases , the financial return seems to be of secondary concern for those who provide funds . This suggests that crowdfunders care about social reputation and / or enjoy private benefits from participating in the success of the initiative . ” Belleflamme , et al , supra note 13 , at 26 . 631 Verstein , supra note 22 , at 11 . 632 Howe , supra note 2 , at 175 . 83 determined by the opinions of those around them . 633 According to Surowiecki , “The more influence a group ' s members exert on each other , and the more personal contact they have with each other , the less likely it is that the group ' s decisions will be wise ones . ” 634 If people can see what others have done before they act , they tend to follow the actions of others , creating an “information cascade problem . 635 2 . Investor Education Many of the investors on crowdfunding sites will be unsophisticated . 636 This lack of sophistication should not preclude adoption of a crowdfunding exemption , but the presence of so many unsophisticated investors presents the SEC with a rare opportunity to educate investors . Each crowdfunding investor , before he or she is given access to any offerings , should be required to complete a brief investor education video or quiz prepared by the SEC . 637 I am not suggesting that the SEC impose a full course of investor education on investors or that the SEC certify whether investors are qualified to invest . 638 Such requirements would unduly burden these small offerings and chill the development of crowdfunding . I am suggesting a brief film or quiz with feedback that would take no more than five or ten minutes to complete . Such a short presentation would not make crowdfunding investors sophisticated , but it would at least allow the SEC to warn them of the potential pitfalls and risks associated with small business investments . The mechanics would be relatively simple . When investors first register with the crowdfunding site , they could be linked to the SEC material , and returned to the crowdfunding site when the educational video or quiz is completed . 639 There is no easy way to guarantee that investors actually pay attention ( or , in the case of a video , even watch it ) , but this requirement would at least give unsophisticated investors an opportunity to learn something . Those who choose not to utilize this opportunity have only themselves to blame . 633 Surowiecki , supra note 140 , at 10 . 634 Surowiecki , supra note 140 , at 42 . 635 Surowiecki , supra note 140 , at 63 - 64 . 636 See Section VI . B . 2 , supra . 637 See The SBE Council Proposal , SEC , available at http : / / www . sec . gov / info / smallbus / 2010gbforum / 2010gbforum - sbe . pdf ( proposing that investors be required to take an online test prior to investing ) . 638 Others have suggested certification of investors . See Choi , supra note 474 , at 310 - 311 ( proposing that investors be licensed ) ; Note , Unsophisticated Wealth , supra note 607 , at 759 - 762 ( 2009 ) ( proposing that investors be licensed ) . See also Jeffrey J . Hass , supra note 219 , at 112 ( arguing that unseasoned issuers should have to make a suitability determination before selling securities to unsophisticated retail investors ) . 639 Crowdfunding sites would not be required to present the SEC material to investors or to endorse the SEC educational materials as their own , only to limit access to investors who have viewed such material . Therefore , any claim that the exemption compels speech in violation of the First Amendment seems weak . See generally ERWIN CHERERINSKY , CONSTITUTIONAL LAW : PRINCIPLESA ND POLICIES 1001 - 1002 ( 4th ed . 2011 ) ( discussing the compelled speech issue under the First Amendment ) ; RONALD ROTUNDA & JOHN E . NOWAK , TREATISE ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW : SUBSTANCE AND PROCEDURE 63 - 64 ( 4th ed . 2008 ) ( same ) . 84 Heminway and Hoffman propose to accomplish the same objective in a slightly different way—by requiring each crowdfunding web site to include cautionary language and certain other limited disclosures . 640 This is a plausible alternative . I prefer my proposal for two reasons . First , it allows a disinterested party , the SEC to control the disclosure and the context in which it is presented . Second , as anyone who has dealt with the detailed scroll - down licenses on the Internet can attest , cautionary language and mandatory disclosures tend to be ignored . 641 Investors could be forced to engage with a non - graded quiz , even if they breeze through it . 3 . Withdrawal Rights and Closing Offerings Entrepreneurs should have to specify their funding goals as part of their on - line proposals and should not be allowed to close their offerings unless and until investors have pledged at least that amount . Until then , investors should be free to change their minds and withdraw their pledges . The all - or - nothing condition and the withdrawal rights allow the social networking aspect of crowdfunding to work fully . Investors can communicate with each other while the offering is open and withdraw their bids if they conclude , based on the information shared , that the offering is not a suitable investment . The all - or - nothing condition also protects the most optimistic and foolhardy investors from their own improvidence . Unless the entrepreneur can convince other , presumably more rational investors to participate , the foolhardy are not at risk . 642 The all - or - nothing condition also forces the entrepreneur to pay greater attention to her financing needs before posting her funding proposal . Knowing that the offering could fail if she completely overshoots , the entrepreneur has an incentive only to ask for the minimum amount that would realistically satisfy her needs . This will lead to more careful budgeting and more careful consideration of the proposal as a whole . Some of the existing crowdfunding sites already impose all - or - nothing requirements like this , 643 and requirements of this type are common in other areas of securities regulation . 640 See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 65 . 641 As a securities lawyer , I should know better , but I routinely agree to scroll - down licenses without reading them . 642 This all - or - nothing restriction “imposes a market discipline . . . You can see whether an artist or organizer can get sufficient attention to a project . ” Tina Rosenberg , On the Web , a Revolution in Giving , OPINIONATOR , NEW YORK TIMES ( Mar . 31 , 2011 ) , http : / / opinionator . blogs . nytimes . com / 2011 / 03 / 31 / on - the - web - a - revolution - in - giving / ( quoting Ethan Zuckerman , senior researcher at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society ) . In this sense , crowdfunding is similar to a Dutch auction , where the price is lowered until a bidder accepts it . See R . Preston McAfee & John McMillan , Auctions and Bidding , 25 J . ECON . LIT . 699 , 702 ( 1987 ) . In this case , however , multiple bidders must accept the bid to complete the purchase . A bidder who seriously overestimates the value of the security does not pay his overestimated bid , only the price set by the marginal bidder . 643 See , e . g . , Kickstarter Basics , KICKSTARTER , http : / / www . kickstarter . com / help / faq / kickstarter % 20basics # AlloFund ( last visited Aug . 23 , 2011 ) ; ProFounder Terms and Conditions for Services , PROFOUNDER , https : / / www . profounder . com / legal / terms _ and _ conditions ( last visited Jan . 27 , 2011 ) ( “If the aggregate 85 Some securities offerings include minimum sales conditions ; if they do , those conditions must be disclosed on the front cover of the registration statement . 644 Closing an offering when that minimum is not met constitutes securities fraud . 645 And , since no contract of sale is allowed before a registration statement is effective , 646 investors who express interest before that time are free to change their minds and withdraw their offers . Similarly , shareholders whose shares are subject to a tender offer are free to withdraw their tenders at any time prior to closing of the offer . 647 Crowdfunding investors should receive similar protection . 4 . Advice , Recommendations , and Conflicts of Interest One of the key determinants of whether a person is a broker or an investment adviser is whether he or she offers recommendations or investment advice to investors . 648 Unless they are willing to register as brokers or investment advisers , crowdfunding sites should not recommend or rate the offerings that appear on the sites and should not advise investors about the merits or risks of those offerings . Without this restriction , a crowdfunding exemption could become a back door around the regulation applicable to brokers and investment advisers . The purpose of a crowdfunding exemption is not to rewrite the definitions of those two terms , but only to allow crowdfunding sites to bring together investors and entrepreneurs . If the sites go beyond that basic structure and offer investment advice , they should have to face the regulatory consequences . Similarly , crowdfunding sites should not make a market in securities other than initially matching investors and entrepreneurs . If crowdfunding sites set up a market to enable investors to trade the securities they have bought , they should have to register as exchanges or alternative trading systems . Some of the SEC no - action letters regarding matching services condition relief on the non - participation of the site and its employees in any of the posted offerings . 649 Although typically unstated by the SEC staff , the concern is obvious : participation in the advertised offerings gives the site and its employees a financial interest in favoring or promoting particular offerings . 650 If recommendations and other investment advice are prohibited , value of pledges that Company receives in its Raise does not meet Company ' s Raise Goal within the time period allotted , ProFounder will no longer continue to support the making or collection of pledges for that particular Raise , pledges will not be converted to Investments and funds distributed to Company , and no money will change hands on the Website . ” ) .

The concern here is the incentive to promote particular offerings in which the site’s operators have invested or plan to invest . 86 the potential dangers of such conflicts are reduced . Nevertheless , a conflict - of - interest prohibition would eliminate any incentives to manipulate the system to promote or favor particular offerings . And , necessary or not , a conflict - of - interest prohibition like this could enhance the public reputation of crowdfunding sites . 651 Such restrictions seem relatively harmless ; the cost to the site of imposing such a policy would be small . 652 Neither crowdfunding sites nor their employees should be allowed to invest in the offerings that appear on the site . 5 . Site Notification to the SEC Crowdfunding sites that meet these requirements should not have to register as brokers , investment advisers , or exchanges , and no other special registration should be required . However , sites should have to notify the SEC that they are acting as crowdfunding sites pursuant to the exemption . The SEC , understandably , will want to monitor how the crowdfunding exemption is being used and whether sites are in compliance and it can do that only if it knows where crowdfunding is happening . A single - page form with the site’s name and URL would be sufficient . Since the sites will be open to the public , including the SEC , that is all the SEC will need for monitoring purposes . This notice should not trigger any other regulatory requirements . The more the SEC requires from these sites , the greater the cost that will be passed along to entrepreneurs doing crowdfunding , and the less effective the crowdfunding exemption will be . D . Other Possible Requirements 1 . Non - Profit Versus Profit Status The SEC no - action letters applying the definitions of broker and investment adviser to Internet matching sites have often focused on the provider’s non - profit status . 653 A for - profit provider obviously has a stronger incentive to push investors and entrepreneurs to complete the proposed transactions , even if those transactions are not in investors’ best interests . 654 This is especially true when , as in the case of many existing crowdfunding sites , the site operator’s compensation depends on completion of the transaction . But that profit motivation also gives companies incentives to establish crowdfunding sites in the first place and to develop and improve those sites . 655 With the exception of Kiva , 651 Of course , if that is the case , individual sites have a competitive incentive to impose and promote such policies , whether or not the SEC requires them . 652 The site should not be liable if an employee , without its knowledge or complicity , invests in one of the site’s offerings—for example , through a false identity . Possible liability of that sort would impose a major cost on crowdfunding sites . If the crowdfunding site has a conflict - of - interest policy , informs its employees of its policy , and checks to see if employees are logging in , the site should not be liable . 653 See Section IV . B . 2 . e and text accompanying note 308 , supra . 654 See Verstein , supra note 22 , at 14 ( peer - to - peer lending platforms “have an incentive to encourage lending , but suffer little if the lending is imprudent . ) 655 See Olivia L . Walker , The Future of Microlending in the United States : A Shift from Charity to Profits ? 6 OHIO ST . BUS . L . J . 383 , 393 - 395 ( 2011 ) ( arguing that , for microlending to succeed in the United States , it needs to be transformed into a for - profit industry ) . 87 and that is admittedly a big exception , for - profit sites have driven business - related crowdfunding and limiting crowdfunding to non - profits could seriously restrict its development . Some of the proposed restrictions on crowdfunding sites , such as the prohibition of investment advice and the conflicts - of - interest bar , should temper some of the less positive effects of the profit motive . Reputational constraints will also moderate a site’s interest in pushing investors into inappropriate investments ; a site that develops a reputation for losing investments will suffer a loss of customers as investors move to more reputable sites . 656 2 . Registration / Standardized Disclosure Some of the crowdfunding exemption proposals call for crowdfunding offerings to be registered with the SEC and to make standardized disclosure available to investors . The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council proposal would require some sort of standard disclosure , such as a modified SCOR form . 657 The Startup Exemption proposal would require standardized disclosure and monthly reports to be filed with the SEC . 658 Heminway and Hoffman suggest that “issuers ( both crowdfunding ventures and their promoters , including Web site operators ) . . . file with the SEC ( a ) brief issuer registration and ( b ) a brief offering notice . ” 659 They envision “a stripped down version of either the Form D required by offerings under Regulation D or the Small Company Offering Registration form” used by the states . 660 They also suggest standardized disclosures on the sites themselves about the crowdfunding Web site , the crowdfunded ventures , the interests being offered , the way in which the offering is being conducted , the ongoing role of the crowdfunding Web site after investments are made , and any follow ‐ on ministerial services ( delivery of investor funds to the crowdfunded venture , monitoring of the crowdfunded venture’s operations and financial data , collection and distribution of profit ‐ sharing or revenue ‐ sharing amounts to investors , etc . ) that will be rendered . 661 These disclosure requirements will clearly increase the cost of using the exemption . 662 Any filing or standardized disclosure requirement , no matter how minimal , will increase the need for entrepreneurs to engage attorneys , and the increased cost will drive away small , marginal entrepreneurs . Crowdfunding site operators might help entrepreneurs complete the required disclosure , but that does not eliminate the cost , and such advice 656 See Verstein , supra note 22 , at 14 ( Peer - to - peer lending platforms “have long - term incentives to cultivate impressive returns to gain customers . ” ) 657 See The SBE Council Proposal , SEC , available at http : / / www . sec . gov / info / smallbus / 2010gbforum / 2010gbforum - sbe . pdf . 658 See Exemption Framework ¶ 7 , Startup Exemption , http : / / www . startupexemption . com / ? page _ id = 92 # axzz1T9YWT6vM . 659 Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 60 . 660 Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 66 . 661 Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 68 . 662 Heminway and Hoffman concede that “ [ t ] he major disadvantage of this type of disclosure requirement is its cost . ” Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 68 . 88 increases the likelihood that the site operator will be treated as a broker or investment adviser . 663 The proponents of registration and mandatory disclosure are missing one of the important facets of the argument for small business exemptions . For offerings below a certain size , the cost of any regulatory requirements—even a minimal disclosure requirement— exceeds the benefit . For those small offerings , an unconditional exemption makes sense . 664 No matter how attractive registration and standardized disclosure might seem in the abstract , they make no economic sense for the very small offerings that crowdfunding facilitates . Standardization , although it allows easier comparisons among investment opportunities and therefore has some value to investors , 665 is a bad idea for another reason . Crowdfunding is still in its earliest stage of development . Standardization of what appears on crowdfunding sites could discourage experimentation and freeze its development . Instead of forcing all crowdfunding sites into a federally mandated standard disclosure model , we should allow them to search for the format that investors find most useful . 3 . Restrictions on Resale Heminway and Hoffman propose that any crowdfunding exemption restrict the resale of crowdfunded securities . 666 They point out that investors who buy in a resale market may not have direct access to the information available on the crowdfunding site itself , so resales are more conducive to fraud . I do not believe that such restrictions on resale are necessary or desirable . The existing crowdfunding sites do not maintain trading markets , and they cannot easily establish such markets without registering as exchanges or alternative trading systems . 667 If crowdfunding platforms do establish their own trading platforms , information about the entrepreneur and the offering is available on - site . Given the small amounts invested , active stand - alone trading markets are unlikely to develop . 668 Resale restrictions are likely to serve only as a trap for the unwary . They would expose unsophisticated investors , who are unlikely to understand or even be aware of such restrictions , to liability whenever they sell their crowdfunded securities to Uncle Ernie or Aunt Emma . And , if those restrictions have any teeth , resales could cause issuers to lose 663 See Sections IV . B . 2 . c ( 1 ) and IV . C . 4 , supra . 664 I explain this point in much greater detail elsewhere . See Bradford , supra note 568 , at 29 - 33 ; Bradford , supra note 473 , at 614 - 622 . 665 See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 52 - 53 . 666 See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 63 - 64 . 667 See Section IV . A , supra . 668 The notes offered by Prosper and Lending Club are traded on a platform maintained by FOLIOIfn , a registered broker - dealer . See Prosper Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 11 ; Lending Club Registration Statement , supra note 92 , at 11 . It is not clear how actively those notes are traded . 89 their exemptions because of actions effectively beyond their control . 669 Given the limited danger , any crowdfunding exemption is better off without resale restrictions . E . Preemption of State Law Securities regulation in the United States is a polycentric combination of federal and state regulation . Issuers offering securities must deal not only with the registration requirements of the federal Securities Act , but also with the registration requirements in all of the states in which they are offering the securities . Congress has preempted state registration requirements for the offering of certain securities , 670 but the securities sold by small issuers on crowdfunding sites do not fall within the preempted categories . Even if the SEC adopts a crowdfunding exemption , the states would remain free to regulate crowdfunded offerings . 671 State securities laws also require the registration of brokers and other agents engaged in securities activities . 672 Exempting crowdfunding sites from federal regulation as brokers or investment advisers would not protect them from similar state regulation . The Exchange Act limits the power of states to regulate brokers and their associated persons , 673 but crowdfunding sites would not be brokers under the proposed crowdfunding exemption . The states would be free to construe the term “broker” more broadly than under federal law . The SEC probably could effectively preclude state regulation of crowdfunding site as investment advisers . The Advisers Act provides that states may not require the registration , licensing or qualification of an advisers excepted from the federal definition in section 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) of the Advisers Act , 674 and one of the exceptions in 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) is for advisers designated by the SEC . 675 Because of state securities law , a federal crowdfunding exemption would not by itself allow entrepreneurs to avoid the cost of regulation ; unless state law was preempted , a federal exemption would merely shift the cost to another level in our federal system . Absent corresponding state exemptions , a federal exemption would therefore accomplish little . 676 Compliance with state regulation alone is “prohibitively costly if companies are 669 Heminway and Hoffman recognize this issue . They note that “any regulatory solution should address the manner in which investor violations of any resale prohibition impact the issuer’s exemption . Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 64 n . 298 . 670 See Securities Act § 18 , 15 U . S . C . § 77r ( 2010 ) . 671 “Even when the issuer is able to qualify for exemption from the . . . Securities Act , there is no guarantee , other than Rule 506 , that the offering will be exempt from state securities regulation . ” Cohn & Yadley , supra note 21 , at 13 . A crowdfunding site could avoid the application of a particular state’s securities law by not selling in that state . Most states have adopted an exemption for Internet offerings when ( 1 ) the offer specifically indicates it is not being offered to the residents of that state ; no offer is specifically directed to anyone in that state ; and no securities are sold in that state . See Sjostrom , supra note 219 , at 30 . 672 See generally 12A LONG , supra note 162 , at 8 - 3 to 8 - 10 . 673 Securities Exchange Act § 15 ( i ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77o ( i ) 674 Investment Advisers Act § 203A ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ) , 15 U . S . C . § 80b - 3a ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( 2010 ) 675 Investment Advisers Act § 202 ( a ) ( 11 ) ( H ) , 15 U . S . C . § 80b - 2 ( a ) ( 11 ) ( H ) ( 2010 ) 676 Rutheford Campbell argues that requiring federally exempted small business offerings to comply with state registration requirements is inconsistent with the SEC’s reckoning of the appropriate balance between 90 seeking to raise only small amounts of money . ” 677 Therefore , states should be preempted from requiring the registration of offerings that comply with the proposed crowdfunding exemption . 678 This leaves three alternatives , none of which appears likely . First , the states could develop coordinated exemptions that would also free crowdfunded offerings from state regulatory requirements . This would not be unprecedented . Many states , for example , have adopted a Uniform Limited Offering Exemption ( ULOE ) that coordinates with Rule 505 of Regulation D . 679 But the states have been unwilling to extend the ULOE to Rule 504 , 680 and it is unlikely they will extend it to any other exemption for offerings to unaccredited , unsophisticated investors . 681 The second possibility is congressional action to preempt state law . 682 But Congress often moves glacially , and the most recent congressional action , the Dodd - Frank Act , 683 was in the direction of more securities regulation , not less . Moreover , it is unclear “whether small business advocates have the political strength to overcome what is likely to be strong state opposition . ” 684 However , the Dodd - Frank Act included a provision requiring a study of peer - to - peer lending “to determine the optimal Federal regulatory structure” 685 and Congressman Darrell Issa , chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , has been pushing the SEC to facilitate capital formation . 686 So , although unlikely , it is impossible to completely rule out Congressional action to preempt state regulation of crowdfunding . The third possibility is perhaps the most intriguing , but also unlikely . Section 18 ( b ) ( 3 ) of the Securities Act preempts state securities requirements “with respect to the offer or sale investor protection and capital formation and imposes an “unwarranted drag on capital formation . ” Rutheford B Campbell , Jr . , Blue Sky Laws and the Recent Congressional Preemption Failure , 22 J . CORP . L . 175 , 208 ( 1997 ) 677 Shane , supra note 551 . 678 Heminway and Hoffman agree . See Heminway & Hoffman , supra note 8 , at 69 . 679 There are actually two versions of the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption . See Uniform Limited Offering Exemption ( adopted Sept . 21 , 1983 , with amendments adopted April 29 , 1989 ) , in 12B LONG , supra note 162 , at App . C ; Uniform Limited Offering Exemption , in id . , Appendix C - 1 . For a general discussion of the ULOE , see 12 LONG , supra note 162 , at § § 7 : 85 - 7 : 107 . 680 Only four states have exemptions for offerings under Rule 504 , and at no time has there been any serious effort to coordinate the ULOE with Rule 504 . 12 LONG , supra note 162 , at 7 - 199 . 681 Most states have adopted a uniform private offering exemption that exempts offerings to no more than a few people in the state . See 12 LONG , supra note 162 , at 7 - 45 . That exemption is unlikely to work for most crowdfunded offerings . It focuses on the number of offerees in the state , not the number of purchasers , effectively precluding publicly advertised offerings . Id . , at 7 - 45 - 7 - 46 . Some states have altered their versions of the exemption to focus on the number of purchasers , but even some of those states still put an outside limit on the number of offerees . Id . , at 7 - 50 . Other states read a sophistication requirement into the exemption , which would preclude public offerings . Id . , at 7 - 49 . 682 See Cohn & Yadley , supra note 21 , at 82 ( calling for Congressional action to preempt state registration requirements for all federally exempted offerings except the intrastate exemption ) . 683 Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , LAW Pub . L . 111 - 203 684 Cohn & Yadley , supra note 21 , at 60 . 685 Dodd - Frank Act , Pub . L . 111 - 203 , 124 Stat . 1376 § 989F ( a ) ( 1 ) ( July 21 , 2010 ) . 686 See Issa Letter , supra note 456 . 91 . . . [ of securities ] . . . to qualified purchasers , as defined by the Commission by rule . ” 687 The statute itself does not define “qualified purchaser ; ” it says the SEC “may define the term . . . differently with respect to different categories of securities , consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors . ” 688 The SEC could define the term qualified purchaser to include purchasers pursuant to a crowdfunding exemption , thereby exempting crowdfunding offerings from state registration requirements . 689 This would not solve the “broker” or “investment adviser” issues under state law , but it would exempt the offerings themselves from registration . However , it is reasonably clear that , when Congress added this provision to the Securities Act , in the National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 , it intended “qualified purchaser” to encompass only “sophisticated investors , capable of protecting themselves in a manner that renders regulation by State authorities unnecessary . ” 690 Rutheford Campbell argues that this legislative history should not limit the SEC , 691 but the SEC proposal to implement section 18 ( b ) ( 3 ) , still not adopted , equates the term qualified purchaser with the term “accredited investor” in Regulation D . 692 Most crowdfunding investors are not accredited investors , so the SEC is unlikely to include them within the definition of “qualified purchaser” for purposes of preemption . In addition , the SEC’s most recent attempt to preempt state law with respect to standards of conduct for attorneys was not well received by the states . 693 The Commission is probably not willing to repeat that experience to promote crowdfunding . VIII . Conclusion The SEC should adopt an exemption to facilitate crowdfunded securities offerings . That exemption should include the basic features outlined above . Issuers should be able to raise a maximum of $ 250 , 000 each year without registration or other information 687 Securities Act § 18 ( b ) ( 3 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77r ( b ) ( 2 ) ( 2010 ) 688 Securities Act § 18 ( b ) ( 3 ) , 15 U . S . C . § 77r ( b ) ( 2 ) ( 2010 ) . 689 This is not an original idea ; shortly after these preemption provisions were added by the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 , Rutheford B Campbell proposed that the SEC define “qualified purchaser” to include all purchasers in offerings pursuant to the Rules 504 , 505 , 147 , and Regulation A exemptions . Campbell , supra note 676 , at 207 . See also Sjostrom , supra note 213 , at 587 - 588 ( noting this as a possible solution to the problem state regulation poses to Internet offerings ) . 690 H . R . Rep . No . 622 , 104th Cong . , 2d . Sess . 31 ( 1996 ) . See also S . Rep . No . 293 , 104th Cong . , 2d Sess . 15 ( 1996 ) . 691 Campbell , supra note 676 , at 207 - 208 . Campbell notes that the statute itself contains no such restriction and states that the legislative history is “so disjointed and confusing as to be essentially worthless . ” Id . , at 208 . Section 18 requires the SEC to define the term “consistent with the public interest . ” Securities Act § 18 ( b ) ( 3 ) . Professor Campbell also points out that , in considering what is in the public interest , the SEC must consider not only investor protection , but also “whether the action will promote efficiency , competition , and capital formation . ” Id . , at 207 . 692 See Defining the Term “Qualified Purchaser” Under the Securities Act of 1933 , Securities Act Release No . 33 - 80441 ( Dec . 19 , 2001 ) . 693 In 2003 , the SEC adopted new standards of professional conduct for attorneys practicing before the SEC . See Implementation of Standards of Professional Conduct for Attorneys , Securities Act Release No . 8185 ( Jan . 29 , 2003 ) . Section 205 . 6 ( c ) of those rules preempts inconsistent state standards . See 17 C . F . R . § 205 . 6 ( c ) . Some of the state bars did not react favorably to this preemption of their ethical rules . See Christin M . Stephens , Sarbanes - Oxley and Regulation of Lawyers’ Conduct : Pushing the Boundaries of the Duty of Confidentiality , 24 ST . LOUIS U . PUB . L . REV . 271 , 286 - 293 ( 2005 ) . 92 requirements , provided that each investor invests no more than $ 250 to $ 500 a year in crowdfunding offerings . Those crowdfunded offerings should include a funding goal and should not close until that goal is met . Until then , investors should be free to withdraw from the offering . The exemption should also require that the offering be made on a crowdfunding site that  notifies the SEC it is facilitating crowdfunding offerings under the exemption  is open to the general public ;  provides a communication portal that allows investors to communicate about each offering ;  requires investors to fulfill a simple education requirement before investing ;  does not invest , and does not allow its employees to invest , in the site’s offerings ; and  does not offer investment advice . Crowdfunding is no panacea . None of the requirements I propose will guarantee that investors receive their expected returns . None of these requirements will protect investors from the losses often incurred by investors in small businesses . None of these requirements will prevent fraud . That is not the point of the proposed crowdfunding exemption . Instead , the proposed crowdfunding exemption is an attempt to promote small business capital formation by exempting offerings where the cost of registration clearly exceeds any possible benefits . The proposed exemption allows smaller , unsophisticated investors to act as capitalists , to learn by doing , while protecting those investors from catastrophic losses they cannot bear . And , finally , the proposed exemption attempts to bring securities regulation into the modern world of social networking and the Internet , to reconcile the regulatory requirements of 1933 with the realities of 2011 .
