Clements Florida State University Jac10f @ fsu . edu Abstract Technology is a catalyst for communication and collaboration , and the use of information systems for these applications is prevalent . While there are countless benefits associated with communication and collaboration tools , detriments do exist . One pitfall is the prevalence of deviant behaviors online which can jeopardize the effectiveness of these tools . This paper presents the results of a study designed to investigate antecedents of online deviant behavior . The results indicate that impulsiveness , moral relativity , the perception of harm to others , and guilt influence the propensity for computer users to commit deviant acts . The implications and limitations of this work , as well as directions for future research , are discussed . 1 . Introduction The increased ubiquity , integration , and interconnectedness of technology continues to revolutionize how individuals communicate within an organization . While technological advances have largely improved the ability to communicate efficiently and effectively , they have also provided the means of expressing new forms of deviant behavior . Two important functions provided by technology are the ability of employees and team members to communicate and collaborate . Computer - mediated communication ( CMC ) has been a topic of interest for both information systems researchers and practitioners for several decades [ 29 , 67 , 39 , 19 ] . Organizations value the lower costs , access to information , and flexibility that CMC technologies afford [ 59 ] , while researchers in this area have investigated the effectiveness of teams using CMC relative to teams not supported by CMC [ 29 ] . A meta - analysis of CMC research found that teams leveraging CMC technologies did not outperform teams lacking CMC tools [ 3 ] . Despite this finding , George and Marett [ 29 ] cite the value of CMC as it affords flexibility in both synchronicity and proximity . Due to the utility provided by CMC technologies , they pervade in virtually every industry . While CMC tools may not always improve the performance of teams , collaboration tools have been found to improve performance . For example , Group Support Systems ( GSS ) are leveraged by firms to facilitate collaboration , yielding improvements in the efficiency and productivity of teams [ 6 ] . Furthermore , empirical research , comprised of both laboratory [ 25 , 18 ] and field studies [ 26 ] , suggests that GSS improve the productivity of teams in a majority of instances . Examples of other systems influencing the creation and management of information in organizations include Collaboration Information Systems ( CIS ) and Knowledge Management Systems ( KMS ) [ 50 ] . Systems facilitating communication and collaboration have become prevalent in many organizations ; however , it is important to note that these tools are not limited to the private sector . The Internet provides countless opportunities for collaboration and CMC in a wide range of contexts , including government , academic , and personal use . Furthermore , the Internet itself can be thought of as a catalyst for CMC and collaboration . As such , CMC and collaboration tools can be purposed for a variety of applications in an array of contexts ; however , these tools are not without weakness . Users of these tools can misuse them for nefarious purposes thereby mitigating their effectiveness by committing deviant acts [ 17 ] . For the purposes of this paper , we refer to an existing sociological definition of deviance , which states that deviance is “… nonconformance to a given set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a c ommunity or society” [ 30 , 17 ] . The purpose of this exploratory study is to identify possible determinants of deviant acts online . As antecedents of deviance are identified and better understood , steps can be taken to prevent online deviance . We propose and test a model that can be used to predict online deviance ( refer to Figure 1 in the Appendix ) . The remainder of this paper will be presented as follows .

Second , the methodology used to collect the data will be discussed . Finally , the results , implications , and future directions of this work will be presented . 2 . Literature Review 2 . 1 Online Deviance Deviance can be defined as “…nonconformance to a given set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society” [ 30 , 17 ] . In an online context , deviance can refer to an extensive range of activities [ 17 ] , including but not limited to : deception [ 8 , 33 , 74 , 75 ] , flaming [ 43 ] , internet addiction [ 73 , 4 , 58 ] , spamming [ 72 ] , cybercrimes [ 41 , 44 ] , piracy [ 11 , 31 , 16 ] , and pornography [ 40 , 15 , 71 ] . Each of these deviant behaviors can result in negative ramifications in all contexts . While the prevalence of technology , both in organizations and in personal use , yields countless benefits and opportunities , it also provides unique opportunities for deviant behavior [ 56 , 55 ] . Criminologists identify three contributing factors that lead to crime , namely motivation , opportunity , and the absence of a capable guardian [ 32 ] . According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , legislation has been enacted in roughly 35 states that targets online deviance in the form of cyberbullying [ 49 ] . While not all deviant acts can be categorized as criminal , these three factors map appropriately to this context . Empirical research suggests that the motivations fueling online deviance are diverse , including academic dishonesty [ 64 ] , pirating copyrighted media [ 52 , 11 , 31 ] , criminal acts [ 41 , 44 ] , pornography [ 40 , 15 , 71 ] , and others . A sense of personal justification may also motivate people to misbehave online . Daniel [ 13 ] reported that a study of online deviance found that students did not view their own behavior as being deviant , while they did classify the behavior of their peers to be deviant . The opportunities for online deviance have never been so extensive as technology continues to permeate every aspect of life . The following quote illustrates this point . “The global buildup of Internet connectivity and growing availability of inexpensive computing and communication devices have made the World Wide Web a virtual continent that is borderless . Anyone in the world with a computer and Internet access can explore , join , build , or abandon any Web community at any time” [ 45 ] . Finally , the lack of a capable guardian is a catalyst for online deviance . An empirical study queried students ( 90 % of whom admitted to online misbehavior in the previous 12 months ) regarding factors contributing to their online misbehavior [ 56 ] . They cited the following reasons : disconnectedness from real life , lower levels of surveillance , a lower risk of being caught , and an altered way of being when online [ 56 ] . Commenting on the lack of guardianship in virtual communities , Williams [ 70 ] stated “ If the virtual environment is to become a ‘second home’ for a large proportion of the population , as is the case for many already , then structures that protect their fundamental rights in the actual must be duplicated in the virtual . ” Additionally , a lack of awareness of the legal implications of deviant behavior [ 20 ] may also contribute to its prevalence . Finally , a number of studies have attempted to identify dispositional and demographic factors contributing to online deviance . For example , prior work suggests that flexible moral boundaries [ 55 ] , tendencies for manipulative behavior [ 55 ] , Machiavellianism [ 1 ] , age [ 1 ] , and frequent use of the Internet can lead to an increase in online deviance [ 22 ] . The specific online deviant behaviors of interest in this study are reflected in our conceptualization of cyberbullying ( CB ) . Cyberbullying is a form of online deviance ; it is defined as an aggressive and deliberate behavior that is frequently repeated over time , carried out by a group or an individual using electronics , and aimed at a victim who cannot defend him - or her - self [ 7 ] . The electronically communicated deviant acts of aggression associated with CB include : insulting , flaming , hacking , threatening , excluding , rumor - spreading , sexually harassing , intimidating and humiliating . Thus , our conceptualization of online deviance is captured by these acts of electronic aggression . While prior research has attempted to understand antecedents of online deviance , this study attempts to illuminate this area of research by testing an exploratory model than can be used to predict deviant behavior online . Theoretical support for the constructs included in this model and hypotheses for each construct are presented in the following sections . 2 . 2 Impulsiveness Impulsiveness has been a rich area of research as it is associated with the major personality systems [ 69 ] . Prior research suggests that impulsiveness is linked with a number of harmful behaviors [ 23 ] , including but not limited to anti - social personality disorder [ 2 ] , substance abuse [ 10 , 63 ] , and aggression [ 36 ] . In this study , we refer to an existing view of impulsivity [ 47 ] , which defines it as a predisposition toward rapid , unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli 325 326 without regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individual or to others . Our model of deviant behavior predicts that impulsiveness will positively impact the perception that how a person acts does not harm other people . This can be attributed to the fact that an impulsive person will likely not take time to consider whether or not their actions will positively or negatively influence the person with whom they are interacting . Additionally , it is likely that impulsive individuals will not feel guilt for their actions as their behavior is sporadic , not calculated . The following hypotheses are proposed : H1 : Impulsiveness will be positively associated with no harm to others . H2 : Impulsiveness will be negatively associated with guilt . 2 . 3 Moral Relativity Tilghman - Osborne and colleagues [ 65 ] define a moral transgression as “the idea that the individual being evaluated has violated a sense of right and wrong . ” Furthermore , Harder and Greenwald [ 34 ] contend that a sense of moral transgression is necessary in order to feel guilt . Prior work supports the notion that the moral and ethical perspective of an individual can have a significant impact on his or her tendency to commit deviant behaviors online [ 55 , 27 ] . Shaw et al . provide a number of examples illustrating this point [ 57 ] . For example , some computer users contest that insecure systems are justifiable targets for cyber - attacks . Other users perceive the hiring of former cyber criminals for security positions as justification for illicit behaviors [ 57 ] . Furthermore , as users with a high moral standing interact with others possessing immoral attitudes and views , immoral socialization can occur [ 14 ] . In the proposed research model , we predict that moral relativity will influence both the No Harm to Others construct as well as the Guilt construct . This component of the model accounts for between - subject variations in how harmful people perceive deviant acts to be , as well as how guilty persons committing deviant acts should feel based on moral relativity . The following hypotheses are presented : H3 : Moral relativity will be positively associated with no harm to others . H4 : Moral relativity will be negatively associated with guilt . 2 . 4 No Harm to Others The extent to which a person feels that their actions can harm another has been linked to feelings of guilt [ 65 ] . Tilghman and colleagues [ 65 ] refer to this concept as ‘ social transgression ’ , and define it as “the idea that an individual’s action or inaction caused others to be hurt” [ 65 ] . S imilarly , O’Connor et al . [ 51 ] state that by definition , guilt is directly tied to the act of hurting another . Additionally , the perception that a person’s actions will not harm another can result in an increase of deviant behavior . For example , psychopaths exhibit “… a failure to review the harmful consequences of one’s actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior” [ 35 ] . Our model of deviant behavior predicts that a person’s perception that their actions will not harm others positively influences the tendency of that person to commit deviant acts . Additionally , as a person fails to recognize the harmful nature of their actions , the less guilty they will feel about deviant acts . The following hypotheses are proposed : H5 : No harm to others will be negatively associated with guilt . H6 : No harm to others will be positively associated with deviant behavior . 2 . 5 Guilt Feelings of guilt have been shown to influence both the perception of right and wrong and decision making in children as young as 3 years of age [ 65 , 21 ] . A recent review of guilt literature considered the work of 23 theory - based definitions of guilt and 25 measures of guilt to formulate the following definition [ 65 ] : “…guilt is a complex construct that , at its core , has both affective and cognitive components [ 68 , 42 ] . Guilt involves moral transgressions ( real or imagined ) in which people believe that their action ( or inaction ) contributed to negative outcomes” [ 65 ] . The declaration that guilt relates to both real and imagined transgressions is critical to the study of guilt as it relates to online deviance . As computer users interact with others via CMC tools , collaboration tools , and the Internet , they may not perceive the ramifications of their actions as readily as during face - to - face communicative exchanges due to feelings of anonymity and a lack of communication cues [ 8 ] . For example , the deviant act of deceiving another person online may not be considered as serious to the deceiver as he or she may be acting under a false identity [ 8 , 62 ] . Our contention is that while deviant acts committed online may not carry the same weight as deviant acts committed in reality , they do fall on the spectrum between real and imagined moral transgressions . In the proposed research model , we predict that the propensity for an individual to feel guilty will negatively influence the tendency for that 326 327 individual to commit deviant acts . If a person recognizes that what he or she does can negatively influence others , then he or she will likely encounter feelings of guilt after committing a deviant act . The following hypothesis is proposed : H7 : Guilt will be negatively associated with deviant behavior . 2 . 6 Social Desirability Social desirability was included as a control variable in the model to reduce response bias [ 12 ] . Social desirability was measured using the short form of the Crowne and Marlowe scale [ 60 , 24 ] . 3 . Methodology 3 . 1 Participants Participants ( N = 450 ) were recruited from a large western university in the U . S . to complete a survey instrument . Participants were junior and senior business majors , with a mean age of 24 years old ; 72 . 9 % were male . Students willing to complete the survey were awarded extra credit points in their respective courses . The mean time needed to complete the survey instrument was 21 minutes . 3 . 2 Measures The survey instrument administered in this study was comprised of pre - validated , developed , and adapted measures . Measures for the dependent variable online deviance were taken from Calvete et al . ’s [ 7 ] work on cyberbullying . This measure taps into aspects of online deviance such as insulting , flaming , hacking , threatening , excluding , rumor - spreading , sexually harassing , intimidating and humiliating . Respondents provided scores that indicated how often they engage in these deviant behaviors . The measure consisted of fifteen items with scores that ranged from 1 - 4 with never = 1 , once = 2 , sometimes = 3 , and often = 4 . The original scale used three responses ( never , sometimes , and often ) . Thus , the response choice “once” was added to our survey in an effort to capture increased variability of responses . Moral relativity was measured using the ethics position questionnaire [ 9 , 54 , 66 ] which taps into the moral and ethical stance of the individual taking the survey . This measure consisted of ten items scored using a Likert type scale ranging from 1 - 7 with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree . Respondents provided scores which were used to gauge each individual’s ethical and moral flexibility . Impulsiveness was measured using the short form Barratt impulsiveness scale [ 53 ] , which consisted of 15 items scored from 1 - 4 with 1 = almost always / always , 2 = often , 3 = occasionally , and 4 = rarely / never . For this study , only the motor impulsivity subscale was retained for analysis ( items 2 , 9 , 10 , 12 , and 13 ) . Respondents provided scores for this scale which gauges how impulsively an individual acts . High scores indicated high levels of impulsive action and low scores indicated low levels of impulsive action . This study developed two theoretical constructs ( Guilt and No Harm to Others ) using standard measure development procedures [ 28 , 61 ] in an effort to psychometrically measure and test the proposed theoretical relationships hypothesized above . Measures were developed through an iterative process in which the researchers initially specified the domain for each construct . A minimum of 10 items per construct were generated by two researchers and two graduate students . Items were revised multiple times before being pilot tested . Items were then employed in a pilot test ( N = 140 ) [ 5 ] . Poorly performing items were purified , and remaining items were tested in a second pilot test ( N = 241 ) . An analysis of the additional data was completed to ensure the reliability and validity of each construct [ 48 ] . Measures were checked for convergent and discriminant validity after each pilot test . The resulting constructs consisted of 8 ( No Harm to Others ) and 5 ( Guilt ) items respectively . The Guilt measure taps into aspects of how guilty a person generally feels when they do something that is wrong . Items were scored using a 7 - point Likert type scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree . Respondents provided scores to indicate the extent to which they disagreed / agreed with the measure items . Low scores indicated a low baseline level of guilty feelings and high scores indicated a high baseline level of guilty feelings . The No Harm to Others measure taps into a person’s general belief that their actions are their own and that their actions will not harm other people . Items were scored using a 7 - point Likert type scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree . Low scores indicated a low baseline belief that their actions harm others and high scores indicated a high baseline belief that their actions do not harm others . Social desirability , a control variable , was measured using the Crowne and Marlowe [ 12 ] social desirability scale , as validated in short form by Fischer and Fick [ 24 ] . The scale consisted of ten items with scores ranging from 1 - 2 with 1 = true and 2 = false . 327 328 4 . Analysis and Results Before factor analysis could be performed , a data transformation step was conducted to sensibly scale reverse - coded items . As two new constructs were being developed , we conducted a data reduction exploratory factor analysis of the items for our new variables as well as the previously validated variables in the model . The EFA was performed to both assess the loadings of the items on their intended constructs and to reduce redundancy , resulting in a total number of items to ensure sufficient internal validity , reliability , and discriminant validity . The data reduction technique used was a principle components analysis with pairwise deletion ( to account for missing data ) , with varimax rotation ( for interpretation amelioration ) . Factors were extracted based on Kaiser’s [ 38 ] criterion of retaining items with eigenvalues greater than 1 . Results from the factor analysis can be seen in Table 1 . Factor analysis showed that all factors had loadings of . 70 or greater when using a constrained five - factor solution except Guilt5 ( 0 . 688 ) , Impuls5 ( 0 . 552 ) , Relativ1 ( 0 . 466 ) , Relativ2 ( 0 . 695 ) , Relativ9 ( 0 . 604 ) , and Relativ10 ( 0 . 542 ) . These factors were eliminated from the final model . Only items 3 , 4 , 5 , and 11 were retained from the Online Deviant Behavior scale . To assess the measurement model , we next conducted a confirmatory factor analysis in which all observed indicators were specified to load on their respective latent construct , and no observed indicator was allowed to cross - load . The chi - square test was significant ( χ2 = 811 . 95 , df = 510 p < . 01 ) , however , this was anticipated as our sample consisted of 450 cases , and the chi - square test is sensitive to sample sizes [ 46 , 37 ] . All other indices examined demonstrated good fit ( RMSEA = . 047 , CFI = . 938 , TLI = . 928 ) . CFA loadings were used to compute the construct reliabilities as well as the average variance extracted shown in Table 2 . Construct level validity was demonstrated in that the latent constructs accounted for the majority of the variance in its indicators . Accordingly , the average variance extracted for each construct exceeded 0 . 5 . Additionally , the average variance extracted for each latent construct exceeded the respective squared correlation between factors to provide stringent evidence of discriminant validity . To assess the structural model of the study’s variables of interest — Deviant Behavior , Social Desirability , Guilt , No Harm to Others , Moral Relativity , and Impulsiveness — Structural Equation Modeling ( SEM ) using IBM AMOS was used to test the research model hypotheses . To comprehensively gauge model fit , in addition to the chi - square test of fit , we used several fit indices to examine absolute fit , incremental fit , and parsimonious fit . Results indicate that the model fit the data well . The chi - square test was significant ( χ2 = 923 , df = 513 p < . 01 ) , however , this was anticipated as our sample consisted of 450 cases and the chi - square test is sensitive to sample sizes [ 46 , 37 ] . All other indices examined demonstrated good fit ( RMSEA = . 042 , CFI = . 945 , TLI = . 940 ) . Results shown in Table 3 indicate support for all of the following hypothesized relationships : H1 ( . 14 , p = . 006 ) , H3 ( . 38 , p < . 001 ) , H4 ( - . 12 , p = . 018 ) , H5 ( - . 45 , p < . 001 ) , H6 ( . 18 , p = . 007 ) , and H7 ( - . 14 , p = . 040 ) . H2 ( 0 . 00 , p = . 970 ) was not supported . The standardized path coefficients and the R 2 values for the hypothesized model are shown in Figure 2 . 5 . Discussion and Implications The results of this study show that a belief that one’s actions are not harmful to others is positively associated with online deviance . Furthermore , this belief is shown to be positively influenced by both impulsiveness and moral relativity . Feelings of guilt , on the other hand , are shown to decrease the likelihood that an individual will engage in deviant behaviors . However , both moral relativity and the belief that one’s actions are not harmful to others are shown to be negatively associated with guilt . The results of this study have a number of implications for practitioners , personal computer users , and researchers . First , this research identifies a number of antecedents to deviant behavior online . As discussed previously , online deviance can negatively impact the productivity and profitability of teams and individuals in an organization ( e . g . a team member using a collaboration tool to intentionally deceive others in the group by making false statements ) . As antecedents to online deviance are identified , screening tools can be developed to identify individuals that may pose risk to organizations . Second , online deviance does not only occur in organizations . The Internet is mired in deviant behaviors [ 17 ] committed by personal computer users . Understanding antecedents of deviant behavior can be used in both private and clinical settings to aid those committing deviant acts to better understand and more effectively avoid them . Finally , online deviance is a topic that continues to be researched . The findings of this study provide novel insights to research investigating deviance in an information systems context . This work can serve as a foundation for future studies attempting to identify additional antecedents to online deviance , or working to validate the results of this work by conducting an experiment to test the predictive ability of this model . 328 329 6 . Limitations and Future Research There are several limitations of this study that must be addressed . One limitation of this research is the relative homogeneity of the sample as it was comprised of college students in a business school . Participants in this sample likely have higher levels of computer efficacy than most students at the university , as well as the general population . This may reduce the generalizability of our findings as those with higher levels of computer efficacy may have a different perception or understanding of online deviance and its impact on others . Another limitation of this research is the limited scope of the cyberbullying questionnaire used to measure the dependent variable online deviance . This measure only captures online deviance in the form of insulting , flaming , hacking , threatening , excluding , rumor - spreading , sexually harassing , intimidating and humiliating . Thus , the lack of a more comprehensive measure for online deviance is a limitation for this research . Future research should focus on further developing and refining a more comprehensive measure for online deviance . The exploratory nature of building our nomological network to identify antecedents of online deviance is itself a limitation of this study . As such , future work in online deviance should build upon and develop a more thorough theoretical foundation for understanding online deviance . This study leveraged a survey instrument to collect data regarding the antecedents of online deviance . Future research could validate the findings of this work by conducting an experiment in which participants complete the survey developed in this study , then participate in a CMC or collaboration exercise during which deviant behaviors ( e . g . deception ) are observed . Such a study would allow researchers to compare the predicted antecedents of deviant behavior in our model to actual deviant behavior in a CMC or collaboration context . 7 . Conclusion Online deviance has far - reaching implications in a wide range of settings and social contexts . Deviant acts in organizational settings can hamper the productivity and efficiency of collaborative groups . Furthermore , deviant acts in personal computing can have negative sociological and psychological ramifications on the perpetrator and others . The results of this study indicate that impulsiveness , moral relativity , the perception of harm to others , and guilt influence the propensity for computer users to commit deviant acts . These findings help illuminate some of the factors contributing to online deviant behavior , which can be used to both identify and mitigate online deviant behavior in the future . 8 .
