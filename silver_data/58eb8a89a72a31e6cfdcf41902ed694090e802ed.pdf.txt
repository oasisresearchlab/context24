The host cytoskeleton is one of the ﬁrst cellular systems hijacked by viruses in order to ensure their intracellular transport and promote the development of infection . Our previous results demonstrated that stable microﬁlaments and microtubules interfered with human inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus ( H1N1 ) infection in semi - permissive LLC - MK2 cells . Although formins play a key role in cytoskeletal remodelling , few studies addressed a possible role of these proteins in development of viral infection . Here , we have demonstrated that mammalian Diaphanous - related formin - 1 ( mDia1 ) is involved in the control of cytoskeleton dynamics during human inﬂuenza A virus infection . First , by employing cytoskeleton - per - turbing drugs , we evidenced a cross - talk occurring between microtubules and microﬁlaments that also has implications on the intracellular localization of mDia1 . In inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus - infected LLC - MK2 cells , mDia1 showed a highly dynamic intracellular localization and partially co - localized with actin and tubulin . A depletion of mDia1 by RNA - mediated RNA interference was found to improve the outcome of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus infection and to increase the dynamics of microﬁlament and microtubule networks in LLC - MK2 cells . Consistent with these ﬁndings , observations made in epithelial respiratory cells from paediatric patients with acute respiratory disease assessed that the expression of mDia1 is stimulated by inﬂuenza A virus but not by respiratory syncytial virus . Taken together , the obtained results suggest that mDia1 restricts the initiation of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus infec - tion in LLC - MK2 cells by counteracting cytoskeletal dynamics .

Post - infection siRNA Small interfering RNA TCID 50 Fifty % tissue culture infectious dose Introduction The inﬂuenza virus - host interchange relies on viral factors and cell determinants , which play an important part in disease severity and outcome . Understanding how speciﬁc cell functions / components regulate viral replication may provide new starting points for innovative anti - viral researches . We previously assessed the presence of dif - ferent cytoskeletal restriction factors against inﬂuenza A virus infection in semi - permissive LLC - MK2 cells [ 1 – 3 ] , which represent a useful model to study cytoskeleton dynamics . The dynamics of microtubule ( MT ) and microﬁlament ( MF ) networks are regulated by several factors / mecha - nisms [ 4 – 10 ] some of which involve interaction with for - mins [ 11 – 15 ] . Mammalian Diaphanous - related formins are highly conserved Rho - effector proteins with multiple family members , which generate linear actin ﬁlaments and regu - late MT organization [ 16 , 17 ] . In the absence of signals that lead to a rapid cytoskeletal reorganization , formins remain inactive and diffuse in the cytoplasm , while following the GTP - bound Rho family small GTPases activation they acquire an active state and become co - opted at several cell sites [ 17 – 20 ] . Formins perform different functions , including regulation of cell polarity and cytoplasmic traf - ﬁcking of vesicles and organelles [ 21 – 23 ] . Although for - mins are best known as MF modulators , increasing evidence supports the intervention of formins in the regu - lation of MT dynamics [ 24 – 31 ] . Formins could interact with MTs either directly or via partners that target the MT plus ends or alter the tubulin post - translational state [ 16 , 32 – 34 ] . In this regard , biochemical studies revealed different modes of formin domains interaction with MTs , suggesting various regulatory impacts on this cytoskeletal system [ 20 , 26 , 35 ] . It has been reported that mammalian Diaphanous - related formin - 1 ( mDia1 ) is essential for generating stable MTs in different cell types [ 36 – 38 ] . The mDia1 likely inhibits the HDAC6 activity that results in an increase in the level of MT acetylation [ 32 , 34 ] . Although the involvement of formins in various cellular functions is well documented [ 39 , 40 ] , few studies addressed their role as modulators of viral infection through their action on MT and MF dynamics [ 41 – 46 ] . To our knowledge , the involvement of formins in inﬂuenza A virus infection has never been evaluated . Here we demonstrate that mDia1 interferes with early stages of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus ( H1N1 ) infection in LLC - MK2 cells by stabilizing cytoskeletal networks . Materials and methods Cells Rhesus monkey - kidney ( LLC - MK2 , BS CL57 ) and Madin – Darby canine - kidney ( MDCK , BS CL 64 ) cell lines were purchased from ‘‘Istituto Zooproﬁlattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell’Emilia - Romagna’’ ( Brescia , Italy ) . Cells were grown in Earle’s modiﬁed Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 2 mM L - glutamine , 10 % bovine fetal serum and antibiotics ( 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 l g / ml streptomycin ) , and maintained at 37 (cid:3) C in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Culture reagents were from EuroClone . Viral infection The NWS / 33 strain of human inﬂuenza A virus ( subtype H1N1 ; ATCC VR 219 ) was propagated as previously detailed [ 1 ] . LLC - MK2 cells grown to conﬂuence in shell vials were infected at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of , respectively , 0 . 1 , 2 or 10 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) / cell . After adsorption for 75 min at 4 (cid:3) C , the viral inoculum was removed and cells were incubated for the planned time . Human upper respiratory tract cell sediments A total of 10 nasal and throat swabs derived from children with acute respiratory disease hospitalized at the University Hospital of Parma ( Northern Italy ) were stored at 4 (cid:3) C in viral transport medium [ 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , 5 l g / ml fungizone , 200 U / ml penicillin and 0 . 2 mg / ml streptomycin in Hank’s balanced salt solution ] . Each specimen was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C and the obtained pellet was resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 ; 7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl ) before another centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C . The supernatant was discarded and the obtained pellet was resuspended in PBS before cytocentrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature . The obtained cell sediments were ﬁxed in chilled acetone for 10 min at - 20 (cid:3) C and then subjected to indirect immunoﬂuorescence ( IIF ) stain - ing to detect antigens of both inﬂuenza A virus and res - piratory syncytial virus for laboratory diagnosis purposes . Laboratory diagnosis was performed upon speciﬁc medical request , thence there was no need to obtain an informed Mol Cell Biochem 123 consent . Patients’ identity and subsequent medical infor - mation were adequately protected and remained anony - mous during the study . Upon assessment of the positivity for either inﬂuenza A virus or respiratory syncytial virus , the remnant cells of positive samples stored in PBS were cytocentrifuged and ﬁxed , as above described , and then subjected to IIF analysis of mDia1 pattern together with the above - mentioned viral antigens . Antibodies For IIF assays , mouse monoclonal anti - inﬂuenza A virus nucleoprotein ( NP ) ( 1 : 30 ; Argene 11 - 030 ) , anti - respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein ( 1 : 30 ; Argene 11 - 042 ) , anti - acetylated alpha - tubulin ( 1 : 50 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 23950 ) and anti - beta - tubulin ( 1 : 200 ; Sigma - Aldrich T5201 ) antibodies were employed . Additionally , rabbit polyclonal anti - mDia1 ( 1 : 45 ; Sigma - Aldrich SAB1408564 ) antibodies were used . Bound antibodies were detected by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 470 ; Molecular Probes A - 11017 ) , Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 470 ; Molecular Probes A - 11019 ) and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 150 ; Li Star - Fish J - 711 - 095 - 152 ) antibodies . FITC - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 : 260 ; Sigma - Aldrich P - 5282 ) and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 : 260 ; Sigma - Aldrich P - 1951 ) were used to stain ﬁlamentous actin , while 4 0 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI ; 2 . 5 l g / ml ) was employed to detect nuclear chromatin . For Western blotting assays , mouse monoclonal anti - acetylated alpha - tubulin ( dilution 1 : 180 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc - 23950 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - mDia1 ( 1 : 170 ; Sigma - Aldrich SAB1408564 ) and anti - glyceralde - hyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; 1 : 5000 ; Sigma - Aldrich G9545 ) antibodies were employed . Bound antibod - ies were detected by alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) - conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich A9919 ) or anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich A3688 ) antibodies . Drug assays The depolymerization of MTs and MFs was obtained using the drugs C 14 H 11 N 3 O 3 S ( nocodazole , NOC ) and C 29 H 37 NO 3 ( cytochalasin B , CYT B ) applied at 2 l M and 3 . 5 l g / ml , respectively . Drugs were added to LLC - MK2 cell monolayers for 5 h at 37 (cid:3) C . NOC was obtained from Calbiochem and CYT B from Sigma - Aldrich . To examine the relative half - life of mDia1 , LLC - MK2 cells were treated with 100 l g / ml of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) up to 8 h . Indirect immunoﬂuorescence assay LLC - MK2 cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized in methanol or in a mixture of acetone and methanol ( 1 : 1 ) for 10 min at - 20 (cid:3) C . Alternatively , for the analysis of the cytoskeleton , the cells were ﬁxed with 2 % paraformaldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer [ CSK - B ; 100 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM 1 . 4 - piperazine - bis - ethane sulfonic acid ( pH 6 . 9 ) , 300 mM sucrose ] , for 20 min at 37 (cid:3) C , and then perme - abilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in CSK - B , for 15 min at 37 (cid:3) C . The cells were then washed with PBS , blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 (cid:3) C . After three washes with PBS , the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS for 45 min at 37 (cid:3) C . For negative controls , primary antibodies were replaced by 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS . Cells were mounted in buffered glycerol solution ( Argene ) and analysed through an epiﬂuorescence microscope ( DMLB Leica ) . For each cell monolayer , ten randomly selected microscopic ﬁelds were acquired with the DC 300F camera ( Leica ) and the most representative images selected . For NP ﬂuorescence quantization , ten randomly selected ﬁelds per cell mono - layer were analysed , and NP - positive cells were expressed as mean percentage values of the total cell number per ﬁeld , estimated by chromatin staining with DAPI . IIF assays were performed three times in two replicate shell vials for each experimental condition . RNA - mediated RNA interference For mDia1 knockdown , two small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) duplexes of 19 nucleotides ( mDia1a sense : GCAAA CAUUUGGUGCUGAA ; mDia1a antisense : UUCAGCAC CAAAUGUUUGC ; mDia1b sense : GCUUCAAGAUCUU CAGGGA ; mDia1b antisense : UCCCUGAAGAUCUU GAAGC ) targeting the mDia1 gene expression were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . LLC - MK2 cells at 75 % conﬂuence in shell vials or 6 - well plates were either trans - fected with mDia1 siRNAs ( 40 nM ) or control siRNA ( non - effective scrambled double - stranded siRNA ) , by using the N - TER TM Nanoparticle siRNA Transfection System ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , for 24 h or 48 h . Fifty percent tissue culture infectious dose ( TCID 50 ) assay Viral yields from culture supernatants were assessed in MDCK cells using the TCID 50 assay , according to the experimental protocol previously described [ 2 ] . Mol Cell Biochem 123 Western blotting assay Cell lysates were collected as previously described [ 1 ] . Aliquots containing 30 l g of proteins were loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulphate - 10 % ( mDia1 ) or - 13 % ( acetylated alpha - tubulin and GAPDH ) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The resolved proteins were trans - ferred to nitrocellulose blotting membranes ( Bio - Rad ) . The membranes were blocked in non - fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature , and then incubated for 1 h 30 min in non - fat dry milk with primary antibodies . After three washes with PBS , the membranes were incubated for 1 h in PBS containing AP - conjugated antibodies . Thereafter , the membranes were washed with PBS and signal detection was performed with 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - phosphate / nitro blue tetra - zolium - buffered substrate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Western blotting assays were carried out three times with cell lysates collected from two replicate wells for each experimental condition . Images were acquired using the Quantity One software on the GEL DOC XR system ( Bio - Rad ) . Confocal microscopy Confocal microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope with a 63 9 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objective . The green ﬂuorescent signal was acquired at 488 nm argon excitation laser line and the emission was recorded through a 505 – 530 nm band pass ﬁlter . The red ﬂuorescent signal was acquired using 543 nm He – Ne excitation laser line and detected at 560 – 615 nm band pass ﬁlter . Image acquisition was carried out in a multitrack mode , with the relevant beamsplitters . Each image was the result of the average of two scans of each line to reduce noise . Negative controls were examined in parallel to assess the speci - ﬁcity of the signals and absence of any background . No mutual cross - talking of the two signals was detectable . A series of x – y sections were acquired with an optimal z - step , to cover the whole height of the samples . The results are representative of two independent experiments repeated in two replicate shell vials . For analysis of co - localization , a scatter diagram of the number of red pixels against the number of green pixels was generated from each merged image . The weighted co - localization coef - ﬁcients represent the sum of intensity of co - localizing pixels in red and green channels as compared to the overall sum of pixel intensity above threshold . The weighted coefﬁcient could be 0 ( no co - localization ) or 1 ( all pixels co - localize ) . Bright pixels contribute more than faint pixels . Proﬁle display mode was used for the intensity proﬁle graphs . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed by the GraphPad Prism software ( version 5 . 0 for Windows ) . Two - tailed Student’s t test was used to analyse differences between LLC - MK2 cells treated with control siRNA and mDia1 siRNAs . P \ 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant and P [ 0 . 05 not statistically signiﬁcant ( n . s . ) . Results Cytoskeleton - perturbing drugs unveil the cross - talk occurring between MTs and MFs and its relationship with the intracellular distribution of mDia1 in LLC - MK2 cells NOC and CYT B , that , respectively , depolymerize MTs and MFs , were employed in order to study possible mutual effects on the above - mentioned cytoskeletal systems . To this purpose , LLC - MK2 cells were either untreated or subjected to drug treatments at non - cytotoxic concentra - tions for a period of 5 h , followed by IIF analysis of beta - tubulin , actin and mDia1 patterns ( Fig . 1 ) . As expected , NOC treatment caused the disruption of MT networks manifested in the loss of the radial MT dis - tribution typical for untreated cells ( Fig . 1a1 ) . However less profoundly , NOC treatment also perturbed the MF system , as evidenced by concentration of actin at cyto - plasmic bundles ( i . e . stress ﬁbres ) and cell cortex ( Fig . 1b1 ) . Treatment of cells with CYT B resulted in the distur - bance of MFs and robust changes in cell shape ( Fig . 1b2 ) . Of note , the depolymerization of MFs correlated with restructuring of MTs that became mostly organized into large cytoplasmic bundles ( Fig . 1a2 ) . In untreated cells , mDia1 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern , with a preferential concentration in the perinuclear area ( Fig . 1c ) . In cells treated with NOC , mDia1 demon - strated a granular cytoplasmic distribution , although the preferential concentration around nuclei was still visible ( Fig . 1c1 ) . The depolymerization of MFs triggered by CYT B treatment made the concentration of mDia1 near the nucleus more pronounced than in control cells ( Fig . 1c2 ) . In addition , a ﬁlamentous distribution of mDia1 was occasionally observed ( inset of Fig . 1c2 ) . Highly dynamic intracellular distribution of mDia1 in the course of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus infection in LLC - MK2 cells Based on previous observations , showing that depolymer - ization of either MTs or MFs has reciprocal effects and also Mol Cell Biochem 123 interferes with the intracellular localization of mDia1 , we then analysed the cellular distribution of mDia1 during inﬂuenza A virus infection . To this aim , LLC - MK2 cells were either uninfected or infected with A / NWS / 33 virus ( MOI = 2 PFU / cell ) and cultivated for different time intervals , before IIF staining ( Fig . 2 ) . The overall distri - bution of mDia1 in uninfected LLC - MK2 cells was similar to that observed in control cells ( compare Fig . 2a and Fig . 1c ) . In infected cells , we observed prominent changes in distribution of mDia1 over the time of infection . At 3 h post - infection ( p . i . ) , the level of mDia1 increased , although very irregularly in different cells ( Fig . 2b ) . A tendency to a perinuclear localization was preserved but in cytoplasm the staining became focal ( granular ) rather than diffuse . This mDia1 granular staining similar to the one observed in cells with depolymerized MTs ( see Fig . 1c1 ) was especially evident in those infected cells where the overall intensity of staining remained relatively low ( Fig . 2b ) . At 5 h p . i . , the number of cells with high level of mDia1 was increased attaining almost 100 % , as follows from very intensive cytoplasmic staining of infected cells . At 9 h p . i . , mDia1 demonstrated primarily a perinuclear localization along with a mixture of diffuse and focal cytoplasmic staining patterns ( Fig . 2d ) . At 18 h p . i . , the mDia1 distribution ( Fig . 2e ) remained almost similar . Finally , at 24 h p . i . mDia1 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining together with a nuclear labelling noticed in several cells of the monolayer ( arrows , dotted area and inset in Fig . 2f ) . In parallel , the expression of viral NP was assessed by IIF assays in uninfected ( Fig . 2g ) and A / NWS / 33 inﬂuenza virus - infected ( MOI = 2 PFU / cell ; Fig . 2h , i , j , k , l ) LLC - MK2 cells . At 3 h p . i . , viral NP is mostly detectable as a small granular cytoplasmic staining that appears to reveal the viral NP present in incoming virion particles ( Fig . 2h ) . An initial nuclear accumulation of NP can be distinguished in few cells . Nuclear and cytoplasmic NP immunoreac - tivity was detected at 5 h p . i . ( Fig . 2i ) , with a mean of 52 ± 3 . 9 % of the cell monolayer . The portions of LLC - MK2 cells with NP present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus increased with time and attained 72 . 5 ± 4 . 9 % at 9 h p . i . , 84 . 0 ± 2 . 3 % at 18 h p . i . and 92 . 2 ± 3 . 3 % at 24 h p . i . ( Fig . 2j , k , l ) . In order to get information about the turnover of the formin mDia1 in LLC - MK2 cells , we treated the cells with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide ( 100 l g / ml ) , before IIF staining of both mDia1 and the constitutively expressed protein GAPDH . The results shown in Supple - mentary Fig . 1a – f evidence that the level of mDia1 and GAPDH remained relatively constant in LLC - MK2 cells incubated with cycloheximide for up to 8 h of treatment , suggesting a prolonged half - life for both proteins . Finally , we analysed the effects of cycloheximide ( 100 l g / ml ) treatment on mDia1 level during the early stages of A / NWS / 33 inﬂuenza virus infection ( MOI = 2 PFU / cell ; 3 h ) in LLC - MK2 cells . The results presented in Supple - mentary Fig . 1g – h demonstrate that cycloheximide Fig . 1 NOC and CYT B depolymerize MTs and MFs affecting mDia1 distribution in LLC - MK2 cells . LLC - MK2 cells were either untreated ( a , b , c ) , or treated with NOC ( 2 l M ) ( a1 , b1 , c1 ) and CYT B ( 3 . 5 l g / ml ) ( a2 , b2 , c2 ) for 5 h . The cells were then subjected to IIF assays to detect beta - tubulin ( a , a1 , a2 ) , actin ( b , b1 , b2 ) and mDia1 ( c , c1 , c2 ) patterns . Images were collected with a conventional ﬂuorescence microscope ( magniﬁcation 9 500 ) . c , c1 , c2 The inset shows a higher magniﬁcation ( 9 2000 ) of the mDia1 pattern of the cell included in the dotted area Mol Cell Biochem 123 Fig . 2 Inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus infection in LLC - MK2 cells modulates the expression and the subcellular distribution of mDia1 . LLC - MK2 cells were either uninfected ( a , g ) or infected with A / NWS / 33 virus at an MOI of 2 PFU / cell ( b , c , d , e , f , h , i , j , k , l ) for , respectively , 3 h ( b , h ) , 5 h ( c , i ) , 9 h ( d , j ) , 18 h ( e , k ) and 24 h ( f , l ) . The cells were then subjected to IIF assays to analyse the mDia1 pattern ( a , b , c , d , e , f ) and the merge ( g , h , i , j , k , l ) between viral NP ( red ) and nuclear chromatin staining with DAPI ( blue ) . Merged images show the overlap ( pink ) between viral NP and nuclei .

( Color ﬁgure online ) Mol Cell Biochem 123 treatment does not signiﬁcantly affect the level of mDia1 in infected LLC - MK2 cells . The depletion of mDia1 improves the outcome of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 replication in LLC - MK2 cells Having observed that levels and patterns of mDia1 cel - lular localization change in the course of inﬂuenza A virus infection , we were interested to ﬁnd out whether mDia1 contributes somehow into development of infection . With this aim we analysed the consequences of mDia1 deple - tion in LLC - MK2 cells on A / NWS / 33 virus replication . The depletion of mDia1 was performed using the RNA interference approach , as described in the Methods sec - tion . As shown in Fig . 3a , the efﬁcacy of mDia1 knock - down was rather moderate at 24 h and more pronounced at 48 h . Therefore , the latter condition was selected for further experimental purposes . Next , LLC - MK2 cells depleted of mDia1 were infected with A / NWS / 33 virus ( MOI = 0 . 1 PFU / cell ; 24 h ) , followed by IIF analyses . The results showed that the levels of viral NP were almost doubled in LLC - MK2 cells with a knocked down expression of mDia1 ( Fig . 3d , e ) . Control cells demon - strated IIF staining patterns fully comparable to those of cells treated with control siRNA ( Fig . 3b vs . c ) . We next investigated whether mDia1 silencing improves the emergence of the viral progeny , as estimated using TCID 50 assays . The results presented in Fig . 3f show that depletion of mDia1 caused a statistically signiﬁcant increase ( P \ 0 . 05 ) in the yield of infectious virus progeny . The depletion of mDia1 enhances the cytoskeletal dynamics in LLC - MK2 cells In the next set of experiments , we addressed the question whether the depletion of mDia1 inﬂuences the stability of the cytoskeleton and the cellular distribution of cytoskeletal proteins . First , the level of acetylated alpha - tubulin , a marker of stable MTs , was compared in LLC - MK2 cells before and after mDia1 depletion . The results shown in Fig . 4a demonstrate that depletion of mDia1 caused a decrease in the level of acetylated alpha - tubulin . Consequently , in cells with mDia1 depletion the MT cytoskeleton becomes more dynamic . The notion that the level of acetylated alpha - tubulin decreases upon depletion of mDia1 is further supported by the comparison of the intensity of immunostaining of control cells and cells with depletion of mDia1 ( Fig . 4d vs . d1 ) . Interestingly , the levels of actin and beta - tubulin also appear to decrease in cells with mDia1 depletion ( Fig . 4b1 vs . b , c1 vs . c ) . Moreover , we observed a partial loss of ﬁlamentous actin , especially at the cell cortex level ( Fig . 4b1 vs . b ) in mDia1 - depleted cells . Finally , the distribution of beta - and acetylated alpha - tubulin in these cells was extended to a wider cytoplasmic area , losing the prevalent perinuclear localization observed in untransfected cells ( Fig . 4c1 vs . c , d1 vs . d ) . The formin mDia1 partially co - localizes with MFs and MTs during early phases of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus infection in LLC - MK2 cells Following previous observations , we compared the sub - cellular distribution of mDia1 and cytoskeletal proteins ( MFs and MTs ) in LLC - MK2 cells infected for 2 h with A / NWS / 33 virus ( MOI = 10 PFU / cell ) . Uninfected cells were examined as a control . The results of immunostaining ( representative confocal sections ) are shown in Figs . 5 , 6 and 7 . In agreement with the data presented in Fig . 2 , the mDia1 labelling was weaker in uninfected than in inﬂuenza A virus - infected LLC - MK2 cells ( Fig . 5a vs . b ) . At the same time , the density of ﬁlamentous actin appears to decrease in infected cells ( Fig . 5b1 vs . a1 ) . Partial co - lo - calization of mDia1 with actin was prevalently noticed at the periphery of the cytoplasm in both uninfected and infected cells ( Fig . 5a2 , b2 ) . However , the signal of co - localization was more pronounced in infected cells ( Fig . 5b2 vs . a2 , b3 vs . a3 ) . In the next set of experiments , we compared the sub - cellular distribution of mDia1 and principal components of MTs ( beta - and acetylated alpha - tubulin ) in LLC - MK2 cells infected for 2 h with inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus ( MOI = 10 PFU / cell ) . Uninfected cells were studied as a control . The results are shown in Figs . 6 and 7 . The mDia1 labelling was weaker in uninfected than in inﬂuenza virus - infected LLC - MK2 cells ( Figs . 6a vs . b , 7a vs . b ) , in agreement with previous observations . A partial co - local - ization of mDia1 with beta - tubulin was observed in both uninfected and infected cells ( Fig . 6a2 , b2 ) . However , peripheral MT networks became more dense in infected cells ( Fig . 6b1 ) , and exactly in these areas the co - local - ization between mDia1 and beta - tubulin appeared more pronounced in infected comparing to uninfected cells ( Fig . 6b2 vs . a2 , b3 vs . a3 ) . Partial co - localization between mDia1 and acetylated alpha - tubulin was also observed in both uninfected and infected cells ( Fig . 7a2 , b2 ) . However , in case of viral infection the co - localization signals were observed in a major portion of cells and were prevalently localized in the perinuclear area that was not typical for uninfected cells ( Fig . 7b2 vs . a2 ) .

Discussion Growing observations evidence that MTs and MFs coop - erate functionally in different cellular processes [ 47 – 51 ] and interact physically in the cytoplasm [ 52 ] . Although a number of proteins , including formins [ 16 ] , operate as intermediaries between the two cytoskeletal networks , little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergism between MTs and MFs . Our previous data have demonstrated that polymerized / stable MFs and MTs restrict the initiation of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus ( H1N1 ) infection in LLC - MK2 cells [ 1 , 2 ] . Here we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis on the role of mDia1 at the early stages of inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus infection in the LLC - MK2 model . Using inhibitors that trigger depolymerization of either MTs or MFs , we have demonstrated that the two cytoskeletal networks are structurally interdependent . Intriguingly , the collapse of MTs or MFs also resulted in the modiﬁcation of the intracellular localization of mDia1 , supporting the previous supposition that mDia1 is some - how involved in the spatial organization of both MTs and MFs networks [ 48 , 53 ] . In agreement with previous observations [ 54 ] we have demonstrated that mDia1 exhibited a general cytoplasmic localization in both unin - fected and infected cells ( except for the late stages of infection ) . At the same time we have observed that the precise subcellular localization of mDia1 undergoes sev - eral changes during inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus infection in LLC - MK2 cells , suggesting a virus - mediated recruitment of the protein in speciﬁc cell districts at different times of infection . It was reported that formins localized differently in diverse cell types [ 55 ] . Dynamic changes in the sub - cellular distribution of formins were also observed during spermiogenesis [ 54 ] . Intriguingly , we found that mDia1 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during late stages of A / NWS / 33 virus infection in LLC - MK2 cells . Although the role of formins in the nucleus is still poorly deﬁned , their association with DNA has been assessed , suggesting a role of transcriptional regulators [ 56 ] . In addition , formins are involved in nuclear signalling , and some of them possess nuclear localization signals [ 55 , 57 – 60 ] . One may consider a possibility that mDia1 acts as a transcriptional activator that is transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the later stages of inﬂuenza A virus infection of LLC - MK2 cells when the cells are stimulated to undergo important reprogramming . Another Fig . 8 Inﬂuenza A virus infection enhances mDia1 expression in human upper respiratory tract epithelial cells from paediatric patients with acute respiratory disease . The cell sediments obtained from nasopharyngeal secretions positive for either inﬂuenza A virus ( a , a1 ) or respiratory syncytial virus ( b , b1 ) were subjected to IIF assays to detect mDia1 ( a , b ) , inﬂuenza A virus NP ( a1 ) and respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein ( b1 ) patterns . Images representative of the results obtained from ten samples were collected with a conventional ﬂuorescence microscope ( magniﬁcation 9 500 ) Mol Cell Biochem 123 scenario is that at these stages of infection the integrity of nucleus becomes heavily injured . To this end , it is worth noting that the products of the formin FHOD1 cleavage by caspase - 3 are targeted to the nucleus during apoptosis [ 61 ] . Further investigation is required to better interpret the presence of mDia1 in the nuclei of LLC - MK2 cells at the late stages of inﬂuenza A virus infection . In this study we provide evidence that mDia1 exhibits a long half - life in LLC - MK2 cells ( at least up to 8 h ) . Sim - ilarly , the presence of muscle FHOD3 isoforms after 48 h of COS - 1 cells incubation with cycloheximide was previ - ously reported [ 62 ] . Interestingly , the level of mDia1 at 3 h p . i . is not affected by cycloheximide treatment . Thus , the apparent augmentation of the mDia1 level in LLC - MK2 cells infected by inﬂuenza virus A cannot be explained by an increase of this protein expression . Importantly , viral growth is signiﬁcantly improved in LLC - MK2 cells with depletion of mDia1 . In this regard , it may be important that formins modulate endocytosis mechanisms , by driving cellular membrane remodelling through the regulation of actin dynamics [ 63 , 64 ] . Accordingly , the reduction of cortical actin layer observed in LLC - MK2 cells with depleted mDia1 can explain overcoming of the previously described [ 1 ] MF - mediated restriction against inﬂuenza virus infection . It has been reported previously that over - expression of ten different formins causes MT acetylation [ 34 ] . On the contrary , the mDia1 knockdown decreases the formation of actin stress ﬁbres [ 65 ] as well as the level of detyrosinated MTs , a marker of MT - stabilization [ 37 ] . Furthermore , over - expression of speciﬁc formins was found to increase the level of ﬁlamentous actin [ 66 , 67 ] and to modify the microﬁlament organization [ 68 , 69 ] . In accord with these observations , our present results demonstrate that depletion of mDia1 causes an increase of MF and MT dynamics , which favours the initiation of A / NWS / 33 inﬂuenza virus infection in the LLC - MK2 model possibly via the pre - vention of the virus trapping by stable MFs and MTs that was described previously [ 1 , 2 ] . Taking into account the apparent involvement of mDia1 in control of MT and MF dynamics in inﬂuenza A / NWS / 33 virus - infected LLC - MK2 cells , we analysed its mutual distribution with cytoskeletal markers . By using IIF and confocal microscopy , we demonstrated partial co - local - ization of both MF and MT networks with mDia1 . These results are in accordance with previous observations dis - closing the co - localization of mDia1 with MTs and MFs [ 70 – 72 ] . Although the co - localization between mDia1 and the above - mentioned cytoskeletal systems was observed in both uninfected and inﬂuenza virus - infected cells , the subcellular distribution of actin , beta - tubulin and acety - lated alpha - tubulin changed as a result of viral infection , and co - localization signals appear more prominent in infected than in uninfected cells . Different patterns of mDia1 co - localization with MFs and MTs in A / NWS / 33 virus - infected LLC - MK2 cells suggest that mDia1 may participate in highly selective and virus - mediated interac - tions with one or the other of the aforementioned cytoskeletal networks . Finally , the modulation of mDia1 expression found in human epithelial respiratory cells infected by inﬂuenza A virus but not by respiratory syncytial virus suggests that in vivo this formin might be involved in a virus - dependent way in mechanisms controlling the cytoskeleton . In this view , we may speculate on the fact that the increase of mDia1 expression in human epithelial cells infected by inﬂuenza A virus could be a part of signalling mechanisms aimed to counteract viral infection decreasing cytoskeletal dynamics . The obtained results deserve further in - depth studies in order to elucidate the intimate mechanisms that control these events . In conclusion , this work provides new insights into the very complex interplay that occurs between the host and inﬂuenza virus , evidencing for the ﬁrst time that mDia1 plays a regulatory role on the initiation of inﬂuenza virus infection , by governing both MF and MT dynamics .
