REVIEW The role of G protein - coupled receptors in mast cell activation by antimicrobial peptides : is there a connection ? Priyanka Pundir 1 , 2 and Marianna Kulka 1 , 2 Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) are ancient and essential elements of the host defense system , which are found in a wide variety of species . They show antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms . In addition , AMPs are expressed by different immune cells and have a important function in host innate immune response against pathogens by mechanisms that are different from those involved in direct microbial cytolysis . One host innate immune response that is directly activated by AMPs involves induction of localized inﬂammation through interaction with mast cells . Activation of mast cells releases pre - formed mediators , cytokines , chemokines and eicosaniods , which inﬂuence recruitment , survival , phenotype and functions of many immune cells . Mast cells can respond to AMPs independent of antigen and Fc epsilon receptor 1 stimulation . One of these pathways involves G protein - coupled receptor signaling , which can lead to mast cell degranulation . Whether AMPs activate G proteins in mast cells through a receptor - dependent or a receptor - independent mechanism remains poorly understood and there are a great many questions that have yet to be answered . In this review , we will discuss the possible involvement and role of GPCRs in mast cells activation by AMPs and the gaps in our current understanding of this important interaction . Immunology and Cell Biology ( 2010 ) 88 , 632 – 640 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / icb . 2010 . 27 ; published online 23 March 2010 Keywords : antimicrobial peptides ; G protein - coupled receptors ; inﬂammation ; innate immunity ; mast cell ; neuropeptides Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) act as important mediators of innate immune responses because they have microbicidal activity against invading pathogens . However , AMPs , in addition to exhibiting a direct antimicrobial activity , possess a wide range of immunomodulatory properties . AMPs interact with cells of innate immune system such as neutrophils , monocytes , dendritic cells , T cells , B cells and mast cells to indirectly eradicate pathogens by activating or inhibiting cellular functions such as production of cytokines and chemokines , alteration of gene expression , chemotaxis , modulation of cell - surface receptors and initiation of downstream signaling cascade ( Figure 1 ) . 1 Mast cells are tissue resident cells that have a crucial role in innate and adaptive immunity through the release of stored or de novo - synthesized inﬂammatory mediators . Two major pathways recognized for mast cell activation are ‘immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) dependent’ 2 – 3 and ‘IgE independent’ . 4 Having been overshadowed by the classical IgE - depen - dent mechanism , the importance of IgE - independent mechanisms of mast cell activation is receiving more attention , especially in the context of bacterial and viral infection . The immediate microenvironment surrounding mast cells contains AMPs that , under speciﬁc conditions , may activate mast cells through IgE - independent receptors such as G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . GPCRs are 7 - trans - membrane receptors , which are coupled to heterotrimeric GTP - binding proteins ( G proteins ) . G proteins exist as a complex of G a and G bg subunits ( Figure 2 ) . 5 After ligand binding , G a exchanges GTP for GDP and detaches from the G bg dimer and each activated component interacts with different effectors to initiate various cellular responses ( Figure 2 ) . 5 – 6 Many GPCRs have been theorized to bind and be activated by AMPs ( Figure 2 ) . However , the nature of these protein – receptor interactions and signaling pathways , in context of mast cell activation , is largely unknown . This review will highlight recent advances in GPCR signaling , focusing on the importance of AMP – mast cell interaction through GPCRs . ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES AMPs are a unique and diverse group of gene - encoded molecules , which are highly conserved in their structure , function and mechan - ism of action . AMPs are synthesized as precursor molecules , which consist of a signal sequence followed by a propeptide region . Precursor peptides undergo proteolytic cleavage to release mature , biologically active peptide . 7 AMPs are grouped into four main classes according to similarities in charge , sequence homology , structure and functional Received 20 November 2009 ; accepted 19 January 2010 ; published online 23 March 2010 1 National Research Council - Institute for Nutrisciences and Health , Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , Canada and 2 Department of Biomedical Sciences , Atlantic Veterinary College , University of PEI , Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , Canada Correspondence : Dr M Kulka , National Research Council - Institute for Nutrisciences and Health , 550 University Avenue , Room 432 , Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , Canada C1A 4P3 .

These four classes are ( 1 ) linear cationic a - helical peptides , ( 2 ) cationic peptides enriched with speciﬁc amino acids , ( 3 ) anionic and cationic peptides that contain cysteine and form disulphide bonds , and ( 4 ) anionic peptides ( Table 1 ) . 8 Most AMPs are cationic in nature and their structure is organized such that the hydrophobic region lies opposite to the cationic ( charged ) surfaces . The association between cationic AMPs and anionic microbial cell surface facilitates AMPs to penetrate the microbial membrane , leading to membrane disruption and cytolysis . Various models have been proposed to explain microbial membrane disruption , but in all of these models , AMPs insert perpendicularly into the lipid bilayer of microbial mem - brane , forming transmembrane pores leading to membrane disintegra - tion . 9 Beside these transmembrane pore - forming models , different modes of intracellular killing of microbes by AMPs have also been documented , such as the inhibition of cell wall synthesis by mersacidin , 10 inhibition of nucleic acids and protein synthesis by human neutrophil defensins 11 and inhibition of cellular enzymatic activity . 12 AMP expression The expression of AMPs by different tissues is tightly regulated and corresponds to their gene structure . AMPs are predominantly expressed by epithelial cells and immune cells . Their expression can be constitutive , inducible or both . Human a - defensins , also known as human neutrophil defensins HNP1 - 4 , are expressed constitutively by mature neutrophils . Human defensins - 5 and - 6 are expressed in intestinal paneth cells . 13 – 14 The ﬁrst human b - defensin , hBD - 1 , was isolated from hemoﬁltrate 15 and is constitutively expressed in epithe - lial cells , urogenital tissues and respiratory tract . 18 – 19 Expression of hBD - 1 does not change with inﬂammatory signals 16 suggesting that its function is independent of host inﬂammatory response to infection . hBD - 2 was originally isolated from psoriatic skin 17 and is primarily expressed by epithelial cells such as those lining the respiratory tract . 16 Currently , four types of human b - defensins have been characterized and are referred to as hBD1 - 4 , which are produced pre - dominantly by epithelial tissue . Human b - defensins are also expressed by neutrophils , monocytes and dendritic cells . 18 In contrast to constitutive expression of hBD - 1 , hBD - 2 - 4 can be induced by infectious and inﬂammatory agents such as Gram - positive and Gram - negative bacteria , lipopoly - saccharides , peptidoglycans , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin ( IL ) - 1 b and interferon - g . 19 – 20 Expression of hBD - 3 can be induced by microorganisms , TNF , IL - 1 b and interferon - g ; 21 whereas the expres - sion of hBD - 4 is induced by phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate ( PMA ) and bacterial infection . 22 Besides defensins , another important family of AMP is the cathe - licidins . A variety of cathelicidins have been identiﬁed in animals . However , humans express only one cathelicidin , hCAP - 18 / LL - 37 , 23 produced mainly by immune cells such as neutrophils , monocytes , NK cells , B cells , 24 – 25 squamous epithelia , keratinocytes and airway epithelia . 26 The expression of LL - 37 is signiﬁcantly increased in inﬂamed skin . 27 Upregulation of defensin and cathelicidin gene expression depends on the activation of nuclear factor ( NF ) - k B , activation protein ( AP ) - 1 , janus kinase ( JAK ) - 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) - 3 signaling pathways . 28 Immune activities of AMPs High expression level of AMPs by epithelial cells is advantageous because pathogens ﬁrst try to breach these barriers to overcome the host defense system . AMPs regulate inﬂammation and promote wound healing , tissue repair , angiogenesis , vascularization and epithe - lialization . AMPs are chemoattractants for leukocytes and other immune cells and they inﬂuence cell proliferation and direct T helper responses to initiate the adaptive immune system . 29 Decreased expres - sion of AMPs increases susceptibility to infectious diseases . For example , decreased expression of LL - 37 and hBD - 1 is associated with gastrointestinal infections 30 and respiratory disorders , such as cystic ﬁbrosis . 31 Patients with atopic dermatitis show decreased expression of LL - 37 , hBD - 2 and - 3 . 32 Receptors for AMPs have been proposed although speciﬁc receptor / ligand interactions are poorly characterized . Putative receptors include innate immune pattern recognition receptors such as toll - like recep - tors ( TLRs ) . TLRs are pattern recognition receptors , which bind pathogen - associated molecular patterns such as bacterial lipopolysac - charides , ﬂagellin , lipoteichoic acid , viral peptidoglycans and nucleic acids . 33 The epithelium lining mucus membranes in the lung and GI tract express very speciﬁc TLRs on their apical or basolateral surfaces such that they can respond to speciﬁc infections . hBD mediates its antimicrobial activity through TLR - 2 present on keratinocytes . 34 hBD - 3 induces expression of TLR - 1 and - 2 on monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells . 35 LL - 37 increases TLR - 4 expression in human mast cells . 36 The airway epithelium also expresses several other innate immune receptors such as CD14 , TNF receptors , IL - 1 receptors and inter - cellular adhesion molecule capable of initiating responses to microorganisms and inducing secretion of AMPs . 37 The majority of AMPs are believed to act through GPCRs as the cellular functions induced by AMPs could be inhibited by pretreatment of the target cells with pertussis toxin , a toxin capable of inhibiting GPCR signaling by G a i subunit . 38 AMPs may use chemotactic GPCRs such as formyl peptide receptor - like - 1 ( FPRL - 1 ) to migrate immune cells . 39 GPCR pathways seem to have a central role in AMP - mediated signaling in host defense . AMPs and mast cells AMPs establish an antimicrobial barrier at epithelial interfaces and initiate pro - inﬂammatory responses . Numerous studies have reported increased levels of AMPs in a number of inﬂammatory states . For example , inﬂamed intestinal epithelium exhibits high levels of hBD - 2 compared with normal colon 40 and patients with irritable bowel syndrome show elevated levels of hBD - 2 . 41 Interestingly , initiation of inﬂammation at these epithelial barriers seems to be dependent on activation of mast cell histamine release . 42 Mast cells are hematopoietic stem cells derived from bone marrow progenitor stem cells . 43 Typically , considered as ‘allergy cells , ’ mast cells Table 1 Classiﬁcation of antimicrobial peptides Class of antimicrobial peptides Example Anionic peptides Linear α - helical short anti - microbial peptide Specific amino acids rich cationic peptides β - pleated sheets , high cysteine residues containing anionic and cationic peptides CercopinsMaganins , bervinin - 1 BMAP , SMAP , PMAP Cathelicidins / LL - 37 Bactenecins , PR - 39 rich in arginine and proline Indolicidins rich in tryptophan Small histidine - rich histatins ProtegrinsHuman α - and β - defensins MaximinsDermicidins AMPs activate mast cells through GPCRs P Pundir and M Kulka 634 Immunology and Cell Biology are also critically involved in the defense against invading pathogens . Mast cells are distributed in the tissues throughout the body , particularly in close proximity to blood vessels , nerves , smooth muscle cells and more notably on the surfaces exposed to constant environ - mental challenge such as the skin , gut and airways . 44 – 45 After pathogen invasion , epithelial surfaces release AMPs , which can activate nearby mast cells through cell - surface receptors . Mast cells rapidly respond to these pathogenic stimuli by releasing pro - inﬂammatory mediators . Mast cell - derived pro - inﬂammatory mediators protect the host by limiting microbial invasion ( Table 2 ) . Mast cells also clear pathogens by phagocytosis and / or through the secretion of AMPs such as LL - 37 . 46 Mast cells can form extracellular traps ( MCETs ) consisting of a chromatin - DNA backbone with attached AMPs , ultimately forming a net in which microbes are entrapped and killed . 47 These characteristics of mast cells make them indispensable for a strong defense mechanism . Mast cell activation by GPCRs and mediator release After ligand – GPCR binding , mast cells get stimulated and release a diverse array of biologically active mediators , which initiate pro - inﬂammatory responses ( Figure 1 ) ( Table 2 ) . G a - GTP activate phos - pholipase C ( PLC ) and phosphokinase C ( PKC ) resulting in massive inﬂux of extracellular calcium . 48 High calcium concentrations cause mast cell granule translocation and granule docking . 49 Interaction between the integral membrane proteins called soluble NSF attach - ment proteins ( SNAREs ) present on both , granules ( v - SNARE / VAMP ) and plasma membrane ( t - SNARE ) allows close apposition and ultimately fusion between granules and cell membrane leading to exocytosis of granular contents . 49 PKC further activates the generation of eicosanoids ( for example , leukotrienes C4 and prostaglandin D2 ) through phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipases A 2 pathway ( Figure 2 ) . 50 G bg dimer phosphorylates and activates mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , extracellular - signal - regulated kinases ( ERKs ) and c - Jun N - terminal kinases ( JNKs ) . These , together with PLC - b and PI3K g , regulate activation of transcription factors leading to cytokine and chemokine generation ( Figure 2 ) . This pathway is also calcium dependent . 51 Mast cell - derived mediators such as histamine , TNF and chemo - kines activate immune cells to migrate and differentiate and promote recruitment of immune cells by upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules by vascular endothelial cells . IL - 4 and IL - 13 promote IgE production by B cells ; 52 – 53 IL - 4 and IL - 9 induce T helper 2 - cell responses . 54 Mast cell tryptases and chymases oppose inﬂam - mation by inactivating allergens and inﬂammatory neuropeptides and by reducing toxicity of venoms and endogenous peptides . 55 Leukotriene B recruits effector T cells and immature mast cells . 56 AMPs TRIGGER GPCR SIGNALING IN MAST CELLS Several examples of AMPs have been shown to stimulate and activate mast cell mediator release not only in humans , but also in less evolved invertebrate systems . Invertebrate AMPs Stings of social wasps and bees contain several chemical substances , primarily a range of amines , peptides and proteins that together can produce a wide spectrum of biological effects such severe pain , edema , Table 2 Mast cell - derived pro - inﬂammatory mediators Class of Product Examples Biological effects Preformed mediators / Toxic products Histamine , heparin Increase vascular permeabilityCause smooth muscle contraction Enzymes Tryptase , chymase , cathepsin G , carboxypeptidase Remodel tissue matrix Cytokines IL - 4 , IL - 13 Stimulate and amplify Th2 - cell response IL - 3 , IL - 5 , GM - CSF Promote eosinophil production and activation TNF Promotes inflammation , stimulates cytokine production by immune cells Chemokines CCL2 , CCL3 , CCL4 , CXCL1 , CXCL2 , CXCL3 , CXCL10 Lipid mediators Prostaglandin D 2 , E 2 Leukotriene B4 , C4 Cause smooth muscle contraction , increase vascular permeability , stimulate mucus secretion Platelet - activating factor Attracts monocytes , macrophages and neutrophils Attracts leukocytes , amplifies production of lipid mediators , activates neutrophils , eosinophils and platelets Abbreviations : CCL , chemokine ( C - C motif ) ligand ; CXCL , chemokine ( C - X - C motif ) ligand ; GM - CSF , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ; IL , interleukin ; TNF , tumor necrosis factor . AMPs activate mast cells through GPCRs P Pundir and M Kulka 635 Immunology and Cell Biology local damage and even death in some cases . 57 – 59 The most abundant group of peptides in the venom of social wasps is mast cell degranu - lator peptides , which include mastoparans and chemotactic peptides . 59 – 60 Mast cell degranulator peptides exhibit a broad range antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans . 61 Mast cell degranulator peptides is a strong mediator of mast cell degranulation and histamine release . 62 Masto - paran from vasp venom is an amphiphilic tetradecapeptide and activates mast cell - mediator release by binding G a i proteins because secretion of histamine by rat peritoneal mast cells is inhibited by pertussis toxin ( a selective inhibitor of G a i protein ) . In fact , masto - paran is a potent G protein activator and stimulates the GTPase activity of G a i protein15 – 20 above that of constitutive G a i activity . 63 Mastoparans activate PLC to release Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , showing that degra - nulation and cytokine secretion are likely calcium dependent . 64 Mastoparans also activate PLA 2 to generate eicosanoids . 65 Several other peptides from insects and frogs have been reported to induce mast cell degranulation ( Table 3 ) , showing that association between AMPs and mast cells is an important ﬁrst line of defense in organisms lacking well - developed adaptive immunity . AMPs from mammals The two well - characterized families of mammalian AMPs , defensins and cathelicidins , promote inﬂammatory innate immune responses by inducing mast cell - mediator release and mast cell chemotaxis . Human a - defensins induce secretion of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells 66 and human mast cells ; induce epithelial cell proliferation ; promote epithelial wound repair 67 and serve as chemoattractant for leukemic HMC - 1 . 68 hBD - 2 , - 3 , - 4 and LL - 37 induce mast cell degranulation 36 , 69 and PGD 2 production , 69 – 70 but hBD - 3 is more potent than hBD - 4 in this regard . 70 hBD - 2 , - 3 , - 4 and LL - 37 are chemotactic for mast cells . 70 – 72 LL - 37 , hBD - 3 and - 4 activate mast cells to release histamine , which in turn increases vascular permeability in the skin . This requires phosphorylation of MAPK p38 and ERK 1 / 2 . 70 , 73 LL - 37 also induces production of the Th1 cytokine IL - 2 , Th2 cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 5 and pro - inﬂammatory cytokines TNF and IL - 1 b by laboratory of allergic diseases cells ( LAD2 ) human mast cell line , 36 suggesting that LL - 37 can mediate both pro - inﬂammatory and anti - inﬂammatory effects by activating mast cells to modify host defenses against infection . To elucidate the signaling mechanisms involved , these studies have largely focused on the use of inhibitors of GPCR signaling pathways like pertussis toxin , U - 73122 ( PLC inhibitor ) , wortmannin ( PI3 - K inhibitor ) and R0 - 31 - 8220 ( PKC inhibitor ) 69 – 72 suggesting that defen - sins and cathelicidins stimulate mast cell - mediator release and through the activation of G proteins signaling . 74 The chemotactic effect of defensins and cathelicidins is suppressed by pertussis toxin , suggesting they use G a i PCR .

AMPs activate mast cells through GPCRs P Pundir and M Kulka 636 Immunology and Cell Biology speciﬁc GPCRs involved in ligand binding is very limited . Initially , it was shown that the chemotactic activity of b - defensins for dendritic cells and memory T cells is mediated by human CCR6 , a GPCR . 75 This ﬁnding was later refuted by Soruri et al . who reported that in contrast to CCL20 ( a ligand for CCR6 ) , human b - defensins are unable to migrate dendritic cells and memory T cells thus arguing against CCR6 as a receptor for human b - defensins . 76 This is supported by the ﬁnding that RBL - 2H3 mast cells transfected with human CCR6 did not migrate toward hBD - 2 and hBD - 3 despite high CCR6 expression levels . 76 Murine bone marrow - derived mast cells and HMC - 1 chemo - tax in response to hBD - 1 , - 4 and hBD1 - 4 , respectively , and hBD1 - 4 desensitize each other’s chemotactic impact on mast cells in PKC - independent manner indicating that human b - defensins signal through common GPCRs in mast cells . 76 In similar experiments with human a - defensins HNP - 1 , HNP - 3 and human defensin - 5 were found to be strong chemoattractants for HMC - 1 . 68 Functional receptor desensitization between HNP - 1 and human defensin - 5 in PKC - independent manner suggests that human a - defensins also signal through a common receptor in mast cells . a - Defensins desensitized hBD - 2 - mediated mast cell migration in a PKC - dependent manner , suggesting unique GPCR for both the families . 68 However , the activating and chemotactic receptors for b - defensins on mast cells are still unknown . The ability of cathelicidins to induce calcium mobilization in FPRL - 1 - transfected human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) - 293 cells suggests that FPRL - 1 , a receptor for formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) , may be a receptor for LL - 37 . 39 LAD2 cells express mRNA for FPRL - 1 . 36 However , whether LL - 37 is a ligand for FPRL - 1 remains uncertain as the effect of antagonists of FPRL - 1 and knockdown of FPRL - 1 expression on LL - 37 - mediated activation of mast cells have not been evaluated . NEUROPEPTIDES AS MAST CELL ACTIVATORS Neuropeptides can be classiﬁed as AMPs because various neuropep - tides have been shown to possess microbicidal activity against a range of microorganisms . 77 Mast cells are located close to neurons and this unique positioning allows mast cells to respond to neuropeptides released from nerve endings . 78 Thus , neuropeptides participate in innate immune system not only by killing pathogens , but also by modulating inﬂammatory responses ( Table 4 ) . Substance P is an important neuropeptide found widely distributed in central and peripheral nervous systems and has a key function in pain signal transmission . Its role in host defense has been extensively studied . Substance P is believed to act through tachykinin receptor subfamily of GPCRs known as neurokinin ( NK ) - 1 receptors . NK - 2R and NK - 3R have also been known to interact with substance P . 79 In rodent mast cells , there is some evidence for the involvement of a selective substance P receptor in substance P - mediated mast cell activation . 4 Human skin mast cells degranulate to release pro - inﬂam - matory mediators in response to substance P , express adhesion proteins and produce TNF . 80 In dispersed human skin mast cells , substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) induce dose - dependent release of histamine . 81 Studies with rat peritoneal mast cells showed the histamine - releasing activity of substance P , 82 neuropep - tides Y 83 and calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) . In these studies , very high concentrations ( micromolar range ) of substance P was required to activate mast cells , 84 – 85 and NK - 1 receptor antagonists were found to act as potent secretogouges . 85 – 86 Pretreatment of mast Table 4 Important human antimicrobial peptides expressed during inﬂammation Peptide Effect Antimicrobialactivity References Cathelicidins ( LL - 37 ) Induction during inflammation , wound and blisters ; antisepsis ; reduce cytokine expression ; chemotaxis Broad spectrum 70 . 117 Human alpha defensins Cross talk between immune cells ; chemotaxis ; promote acquired systemic immunity Broad spectrum 66 . 74 Human beta defensins Induction during inflammation ; chemotaxis ; wound healing Broad spectrum 70 . 74 Neuropeptides Substance P ; Neurokinin A ; Vasoactiveintestinal peptide ; Neuropeptide Y ; Calcitonin gene - related peptide Induction during inflammation ; link between mast cells and nervous system in neuroinflammation Broad spectrum 77 . 118 - 119 AMPs activate mast cells through GPCRs P Pundir and M Kulka 637 Immunology and Cell Biology cells with pertussis toxin inhibited histamine release . 82 All of these ﬁndings suggested that substance P degranulates rat peritoneal mast cells in a receptor - independent manner , possibly through direct activation of G proteins . 4 However , a study by Ogawa et al . 87 reported the release of histamine from peritoneal mast cells of a wistar substrain , Std : Wistar rats in response to very low concentrations ( nanomolar range ) of substance P , which could be signiﬁcantly blocked by a NK - 1 receptor antagonist , CP - 96345 , suggesting a receptor - dependent ( NK - 1 receptor - mediated ) mechanism of hista - mine release from rat peritoneal mast cells . In 2006 , it was shown that human mast cells express Mas - related gene ( Mrg ) GPCR . Substance P stimulated human cord mast cells , expressing MrgX2 , to degranulate . 88 Substance P activated calcium inﬂux in HEK - 293 cells transfected with MrgX2 , but not in cells lacking MrgX1 88 indicating that MrgX2 may be a receptor for substance P in HMCs . Whether substance P binds MrgX2 or by passes it to interact with G proteins remains to be determined . Our previous studies characterized the response of two human mast cell models ( primary CD34 + - derived HuMC and LAD2 ) to substance P , nerve - growth factor , CGRP and VIP . 89 Substance P and VIP , but not nerve - growth factor and CGRP , induced degranulation in human mast cells along with the production of cytokines such as TNF , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and IL - 3 , and chemokines such as interferon - inducible protein - 10 ( IP - 10 ) , monocyte chemotactic protein ( MCP ) - 1 , IL - 8 and RANTES ( regulated on activation , T cell expressed and secreted ) . 89 Human mast cell activation was sensitive to pertussis toxin and wortmannin ( PI3 - K inhibitor ) . LAD2 cells express receptors for substance P ( NK1R , NK2R and NK3R ) , CGRP ( CGRPR ) and VIP ( VPAC2 ) . HuMCs express only NK - 1R , NK - 3R and VPAC1 suggesting the presence of functional neuropeptide receptors on HMC . 89 However , as NK - 1 receptor antagonist could only partially block substance P’s effect , 89 these studies suggest that substance P may also activate mast cells in a receptor - independent mechanism , perhaps by direct activa - tion of G proteins . 90 OTHER ROUTES OF MAST CELL ACTIVATION Mast cell - derived mediators secreted in response to AMPs can inﬂuence mast cells in an autocrine manner . Histamine released by mast cells activates histamine H4 GPCRs expressed on mast cells and enhances migration of murine mast cells . 91 Mast cell - derived cytokines and chemokines can also activate mast cell by autocrine activation of GPCRs . For example , CCR1 that binds MIP - 1 a , CCR1 , - 3 and - 4 that bind RANTES to induce chemotaxis in mast cells . Cord - blood - derived human mast cells express cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 and 2 92 – 93 and EP1 - 4 for prostaglandin E , 94 which are coupled to G proteins . These receptors help improve immune responses by increasing mast cell numbers and by enhanced degranu - lation and mediator release . FUTURE DIRECTIONS It is clear that AMPs activate mast cells to initiate pro - inﬂammatory conditions . However , numerous questions still remain unanswered . Which GPCRs actually bind AMPs directly ? Is the interaction phy - siologically relevant ? Do the GPCRs co - localize , and if yes , is there a synergy , competition or inhibition ? Are the chemotactic GPCRs equally potent in mediating mast cell - mediator release ? The current literature suggests that GPCR – mast cell interactions are complex . Most of the studies on GPCR signaling in mast cells have used cultured mouse mast cells and information available from human mast cells is limited . As the nature of responses generated by GPCRs in mouse and human mast cells differs signiﬁcantly , a careful evaluation of both mouse and human - derived mast cells is important . Besides the interspecies difference , phenotype of mast cells also makes a signiﬁcant difference in outcomes of mast cell activation . In rodents , two major distinct mast cell populations have been described as mucosal type and connective tissue type . 95 In humans , the two mast cell subsets are designated as MC T and MC TC . MC T subtype is mucosal with granules rich in tryptase whereas the MC TC has a connective tissue phenotype with granules rich in tryptase and chymase . 96 Connective tissue - type mast cells show higher secretory response to polybasic compounds such as compound 48 / 80 and polymixin B as compared with mucosal type . 97 Hence , selection of mast cell type is important . Further studies with improved models , particularly in vivo studies , are warranted to determine the proper GPCR - mediated pathways and their contribution to mast cell’s role in host innate defense . Use of receptor knockout studies using mice deﬁcient in speciﬁc GPCR is also necessary to evaluate the relative contribution of these diverse set of receptors to antimicrobial effects . There are many other GPCRs that may have a role in both innate immune responses and antimicrobial activation of mast cells . For instance , purinergic P2 receptors have been hypothesized to recruit immune cells to sites of inﬂammation . Chemotaxis of neutrophils is mediated through P2Y2 . 98 Eosinophil trafﬁcking toward platelets 99 is mediated possibly through P2X and P2Y receptors . 100 AMPs may also bind purinergic receptors on immune cells to secrete humoral factors . LL - 37 stimulates IL - 1 b from monocytes by activation of P2X7 receptor thus forming a link between innate and adaptive immu - nity . 101 HNP induced IL - 8 production from human lung epithelial cells through the P2Y6 signaling pathway . 102 Mast cells express P2Y1 , 12 and 13 mRNA 103 but whether AMPs can induce mast cell functions through these receptors remains to be elucidated . Similarly , LAD2 and human lung mast cells express P2X1 , P2X4 and P2X7 . 104 Their role in AMP – mast cell interaction is also unknown . Future research will need to better clarify the relationship between AMPs and mast cells , identify the speciﬁc GPCRs that bind AMPs , investigate the effects of these interactions in in vivo models and investigate their role in host defense against infection . Such studies will increase our understanding of the complex relationship between mast cells and AMPs during innate immune responses .
