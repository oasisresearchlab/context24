The Origin of Motif Families in Food Webs Janis Klaise ∗ 1 and Samuel Johnson 1 , 2 1 Centre for Complexity Science , University of Warwick , Coventry CV4 7AL , United Kingdom 2 Warwick Mathematics Institute , University of Warwick , Coventry CV4 7AL , United Kingdom Abstract Food webs have been found to exhibit remarkable “motif proﬁles” , patterns in the relative prevalences of all possible three - species sub - graphs , and this has been related to ecosystem properties such as stability and robustness . Analysing 46 food webs of various kinds , we ﬁnd that most food webs fall into one of two distinct motif families . The separation between the families is well predicted by a global measure of hierarchical order in directed networks – trophic coherence . We ﬁnd that trophic coherence is also a good predictor for the extent of omnivory , deﬁned as the tendency of species to feed on multiple trophic levels . We compare our results to a network assembly model that admits tunable trophic coherence via a single free parameter . The model is able to generate food webs in either of the two families by varying this parameter , and correctly classiﬁes almost all the food webs in our database . This establishes a link between global order and local preying patterns in food webs . Keywords : ecology , food web structure , network motifs , trophic coherence 1 Introduction Food webs are abstract representations of which species consume which others in an ecosystem [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . In a network - based description , species are represented by nodes and their trophic interactions are represented by directed links , pointing from prey to predator [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . Much work has been devoted to understanding the origin and meaning of the particular trophic interaction patterns observed in these food webs [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] . Faced with the complexity of whole food webs , many researchers have focused on the interactions among subsets of species , through the analysis of small , connected subgraphs , or motifs [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . The study of local interaction patterns via small network subgraphs [ 14 ] ﬁrst emerged in the study of neuronal and metabolic networks [ 15 , 16 ] . The methodology of analyzing the relative prevalence of small subgraphs with respect to a well - posed null model for network assembly remains the main way to gain an understanding of the local structural properties of networks , including food webs [ 11 , 12 ] . ∗ Corresponding author : J .

These can be separated into two groups : ( a ) ﬁve triads , S1 - S5 , that only contain single links , ( b ) eight triads , D1 - D8 , that have double links ( corresponding to mutual predation ) . In this study we focus on the 3 - node connected triads of which there are 13 distinct ones ( Figure 1 ) . Many of these triads admit a straightforward inter - pretation in the context of food - webs [ 12 ] . The eight triads D1 – D8 have double links which correspond to mutual predation between two species . The ﬁve single link triads S1 – S5 consist of some of the more basic building blocks of food webs . The triad S1 is a simple food chain [ 3 , 13 ] , S2 represents omnivory ( a predator preying on two species at diﬀerent trophic levels ) [ 13 , 17 ] , triad S3 is a cycle ( a relatively rare feature ) [ 12 , 17 ] , and triads S4 – S5 represent a predator preying on two species ( apparent competition ) and two predators sharing a prey species ( direct competition ) , respectively [ 11 ] . There are several competing hypotheses for the relative prevalence of these subgraphs in food webs . The prevailing hypotheses are that subgraphs emerge as a result of constraints ( e . g the “niche dimension” ) in the assembly of food networks [ 9 , 12 ] , that functional importance leads to the observed structural patterns [ 18 ] , or that certain stability properties favour some subgraphs over others [ 11 ] . Nevertheless , local structural patterns in complex networks are intimately related to global network properties [ 19 , 20 ] . A network metric called “trophic coherence” was recently introduced in order to capture the degree to which the nodes fall neatly into distinct levels [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] . In the context of food webs , these are the trophic levels , and high coherence corresponds to the species at one level consuming almost exclusively species at the level immediately below ( i . e . low omnivory ) . Trophic coherence was shown to be a major predictor of the linear stability of ecosystem models , as well as of a number of structural properties of empirical food webs [ 21 ] . It has also been related to the numbers of cycles in directed networks , and to the distribution of eigenvalues of associated matrices [ 22 ] . Trophic coherence is a global structural property of directed networks , but it also places constraints on local topological features and on the prevalence of small subgraphs in particular . The extent to which these two properties , apparent at diﬀerent scales , co - occur has not been studied . In this paper we present evidence that the relative prevalence of three - vertex subgraphs in food webs can be explained by the level of trophic coherence in both empirical and model food webs . This result provides another viewpoint in the debate about the origin of subgraph prevalences in food webs and further evidence of the importance of global organization in food webs [ 21 ] . 2 2 Methods 2 . 1 Quantifying triad signiﬁcance For any given network the exact number N k of any of the k = 1 , . . . , 13 connected three - vertex subgraphs ( triads , Figure 1 ) is inﬂuenced by the network size and the degree distribution of the vertices . To test the statistical signiﬁcance of any given triad k , the empirically observed number N k is compared against appearances of the same triad in a randomized ensemble of networks serving as a null model [ 16 ] . This comparison gives a statistical signiﬁcance or z - score z k = N k − h N k i rand σ rand , ( 1 ) where h N k i rand and σ rand are the randomized ensemble average and standard deviation for triad k , respectively . The z - score of triad k thus measures the deviation of prevalence in the observed network with respect to the null model . The z - scores of all 13 triads can be summarized in a triad signiﬁcance proﬁle ( TSP ) which is a vector z = { z k } with components z k for each triad k . Addi - tionally , the normalized version of the TSP is often used to compare networks of diﬀerent sizes and link densities [ 16 ] . This is given by ˆz =   z k qP 13 k = 1 z 2 k   . ( 2 ) The randomization procedure used to obtain the randomized ensemble statis - tics is a matter of choice . A careful selection of null model is important to discern between real eﬀects and artefacts present in the TSP [ 25 ] . In our analy - sis , we follow the conﬁguration model ( CM ) prescription [ 26 , 27 ] , and preserve the number of incoming and outgoing links for each node ( the degree sequence ) while randomizing links via a Markov chain Monte Carlo switching algorithm [ 15 , 16 ] . This preserves both the total number of nodes ( species ) and the links ( trophic interactions ) in the network . The generation of randomized networks and counts of triads was carried out with mﬁnder , the algorithm used by Milo et al . in their seminal work on network motifs [ 15 , 28 ] . It is important to emphasize that the TSP is a relative measure of which triads are over - and under - represented with respect to the null model provided by the randomized CM networks . The over - ( under - ) representation as indicated by a positive ( negative ) z - score indicates that these triads appear more ( less ) frequently than in the randomized networks but do not imply an absolute sat - uration ( absence ) of said triads . Nevertheless , the TSP is an adequate tool for comparing networks of diﬀerent sizes and degree distributions . 2 . 2 Comparing networks based on triad signiﬁcance To quantitatively compare networks based on their triad signiﬁcance proﬁle , we use Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient r between the normalized z - score vectors ˆz a and ˆz b of networks a and b , respectively [ 12 , 16 ] . This is deﬁned as r = P nk = 1 ( ˆ z ak − ¯ z a ) (cid:0) ˆ z bk − ¯ z b (cid:1) σ ˆz a σ ˆz a , ( 3 ) 3 where ¯ z a = P nk = 1 ˆ z ak n ( 4 ) and σ ˆz a = vuut n X k = 1 ( ˆ z ak − ¯ z a ) 2 ( 5 ) are the mean and the standard deviation of the normalized z - score vectors ; a and b specify the networks , k is an index over the triads and n = 13 is the total number of triads . With this deﬁnition a value of r close to 1 indicates that the two networks have very similar TSPs and thus patterns of over - and under - represented triads , a value close to 0 indicates no similarity , and a value close to − 1 indicates anti - similarity – i . e . triads over - represented in one network will typically be under - represented in the other ( and vice versa ) . Comparing the empirical networks between themselves is straightforward as we just calculate the r - coeﬃcient pairwise for the z - score vectors of all 46 food webs in our database . On the other hand , for comparison with the model ( described in Section 2 . 4 ) , for each empirical network we ﬁt the model to the data and generate 1000 instances of a model network and then compute the r - coeﬃcient of the empirical z - score vector and the average z - score vector of the model - generated ensemble . 2 . 3 Trophic coherence Trophic coherence is a global metric for directed networks that characterizes how “layered” the network is [ 21 , 22 ] . It measures the extent to which we can separate nodes into distinct groups so that any given group receives incoming links from just one other group and has outgoing links to another , diﬀerent group of nodes . In the context of food webs , it measures the overall tendency of species to feed on multiple distinct trophic levels . For each species j in the network , we deﬁne its trophic level s j as the average trophic level of its prey , plus one [ 21 , 29 ] , s j = 1 + 1 k in j X i a ij s i , ( 6 ) where k in j = P i a ij is the number of prey of species j ( also known as the in - degree ) and a ij are entries of the adjacency matrix A of the food web . Here the convention is that the directed trophic links point from prey i to predator j . Because of the recursive nature of Equation 6 , to assign a trophic level to every node in the network two conditions must hold . First , there must be at least one node of zero in - degree – we call such nodes basal ; and second , every node in the network must be reachable by a path from at least one basal node . Food webs satisfy both conditions , 1 so the linear system deﬁned by Equation 6 has a unique solution . Without loss of generality we assign s j = 1 for all basal species , as is the convention in ecology . 1 In any ecosystem there are always basal species without prey ( autotrophs ) , and every species is part of a food chain that starts with a basal species . 4 5 1 4 3 2 Figure 2 : Examples of diﬀerent degrees of trophic coherence in food webs . Left : Crystal Lake ( Delta ) – a highly coherent network with q = 0 . 17 , note that only one node prevents the network from being perfectly coherent ( q = 0 ) . Right : Coachella Valley – an incoherent network with q = 1 . 21 , note the high number of nodes falling between integer trophic levels due to the complex patterns of trophic links . We deﬁne the trophic distance associated to link a ij in the network as the diﬀerence between the trophic levels at the endpoints , x ij = s j − s i . Note that this is not a distance in the mathematical sense as it can take negative values . Denote by p ( x ) the distribution of trophic distances as measured on a network . This will have mean h x i = 1 by deﬁnition and a standard deviation q = p h x 2 i − 1 which we will call the trophic incoherence parameter . The trophic incoherence parameter is thus a measure of the homogeneity of the distribution p ( x ) . For perfectly coherent networks we have q = 0 , which translates to having only integer valued trophic levels and all species feeding on prey only one trophic level below their own . In this case the network is perfectly structured , or layered , as there are distinct groups of “herbivores” feeding only on basal species , “predators” feeding only on “herbivores” and so on . For less coherent networks , q > 0 indicates a less ordered trophic structure , where trophic levels take fractional values and species tend to prey on a broader range of trophic levels . See Figure 2 for examples of coherent and incoherent food webs . 2 . 4 Model with tunable trophic coherence Various mathematical models of food webs have been proposed to capture and explain diﬀerent aspects of food webs [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ] , but the main models still fail to capture the full complexity of empirically observed structures [ 21 , 35 , 36 ] . We introduce a model for food webs that allows us to adjust the incoherence parameter q by means of ﬁtting a single free parameter . The model is a generalization of the Preferential Preying Model ( PPM ) introduced in Ref . [ 21 ] , with the improvement that it can generate bidirectional links and cycles of higher order , thus producing more realistic networks . In the following we denote by B , N and L the number of basal nodes , total nodes and links in the network respectively , all parameters to be ﬁtted using the empirical network data . We begin with B basal nodes and no links . We assign trophic levels s = 1 5 to all basal nodes . We then add N − B new nodes to the network sequentially according to the following rule . For each new node j , pick exactly one prey i at random from among all the existing nodes in the network , thus creating a link from i to j . In doing so , we deﬁne the temporary trophic level of node j as ˆ s j = 1 + ˆ s i . After this procedure ﬁnishes , we have a network of N nodes and N − B links , and each node has a ( temporary ) trophic level ˆ s i . Once all N nodes are created , we add the remaining links to the network to bring the expected number of links up to L . The links are chosen among all possible pairs of nodes ( i , j ) ( we exclude connections to basal nodes ) , with a probability P ij that decays with the ( temporary ) trophic distance ˆ x ij = ˆ s j − ˆ s i between them . Speciﬁcally , we set P ij ∝ exp − ( ˆ x ij − 1 ) 2 2 T 2 ! , ( 7 ) where T is a free parameter which sets the degree of prey diversity between multiple trophic levels . This form of probability ensures that the most likely links to be created are between adjacent ( temporary ) trophic levels . The prob - abilities in Equation 7 are normalized so that the expected number of links in the ﬁnal network is L . 2 At the end of the network creation procedure the trophic levels need to be recalculated according to Equation 6 as the addition of new links will have changed the network topology , and the trophic levels in the ﬁnal network need not correspond to the temporary integer valued trophic levels . The free parameter T is analogous to temperature in statistical physics and sets the amount of deviation from a perfectly coherent network . For T = 0 , only links between adjacent ( temporary ) trophic levels are allowed which results in the incoherence parameter q = 0 . In this case the temporary trophic levels co - incide with the actual trophic levels as the addition of links does not change the initially assigned trophic levels . As T is increased , links between a wider range of ( temporary ) trophic levels become more probable , so we expect q > 0 and increasingly more random networks . A sample dependence of q on T is shown in Figure 3 . The model exhibits a monotonic dependence of the incoherence parameter q on temperature T which provides a basis for ﬁtting the model to empirical food webs given the empirically observed q . We also ﬁnd that the level of incoherence that is achieved at any given temperature depends on B / N , the ratio of basal species to all species . We will further explore this relationship in Section 3 . 3 . To ﬁt the model to the food web data , we provide as input the number of basal species B , the number of total species N , and the number of links or trophic interactions L . We then use stochastic root ﬁnding to ﬁnd the value of the temperature parameter T that results in an ensemble of networks whose incoherence parameter q is centred about the empirical incoherence parameter as measured from the food web topology . 2 In principle , the link addition process can be amended so that the ﬁnal number of links is exactly L not just on average . However , this can be detrimental because in some situations , e . g . for low T and high link density , the exact number of links L may not be attainable without distorting the probability distribution set by Equation 7 . 6 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Temperature T 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 I n c o h e r e n c e q B = 10 B = 25 B = 50 f ( x ) = x Figure 3 : Dependence of the incoherence parameter q on the temperature pa - rameter T in an ensemble of networks generated by the model . The networks in the ensembles have N = 100 nodes B of which are basal and average non - basal degree h k i = L / ( N − B ) = 10 . The averages are computed over at least 1000 networks and error bars are one standard deviation of the sample . 3 Results 3 . 1 Motifs in empirical food webs We study the triad signiﬁcance proﬁle ( TSP ) in 46 empirical food webs from a variety of environments : marine , freshwater ( river and lake ) and terrestrial ( See supplementary material for details ) . The results are summarized in Figures 4 and 5 . Figure 4 shows the pairwise Pearson correlation coeﬃcients of the triad sig - niﬁcance proﬁles between all 46 food webs . The food webs are arranged by increasing incoherence parameter q so that more coherent food webs are as - signed a lower ID . Red hue or warmer colours indicate a larger coeﬃcient , while blue hue or colder colours indicate an anti - correlation in the TSPs . We see that roughly two families of food webs emerge with similar TSPs . The ﬁrst family ( roughly ID 1 - 22 ) is characterized by relatively high coherence ( low incoherence parameter q ) , for which the similarities in the TSPs are very high ( r ≥ 0 . 8 ) . There is a second family of food webs , characterized by a high incoherence parameter q , that also show high similarities in their TSPs . Membership to this second family is not as clear as there is a tighter core of food webs belonging to it , with a periphery that only shares some similarities . There are also a number of sporadic food webs that do not appear to fall into either of the two families . The change in family membership as the incoherence parameter q increases indicates a qualitative change in the respective TSPs of the food webs . To better investigate what might be responsible for this change , we look closer at the bulk behaviour of the TSPs for the two families . Figure 5 shows the normalized proﬁles of Family 1 ( top plot , ID 1 - 22 ) and Family 2 ( bottom plot , ID 23 - 46 , excluding the sporadic food webs ID 30 , 35 , 40 , 43 ) . We ﬁrst consider Family 1 .

Figure 5 : Triad signiﬁcance proﬁles ( TSP ) as measured by the normalized z - score of the two groups of foodwebs . ( a ) Food webs in the ﬁrst family ( ID 1 – 22 ) with low incoherence parameter q characterized by an over - representation of triads S1 , S4 and S5 and an under - representation of triad S2 . ( b ) Food webs in the second family ( ID 23 – 46 , except 30 , 35 , 40 and 43 ) with high incoherence parameter characterized by an over - representation of triad S2 . 8 ily is characterized by an over - representation of triads S1 , S4 and S5 , as well as an under - representation of triad S2 . We should ﬁnd the pattern of under - representation of triad S2 ( which represents omnivory ) unsurprising , since food webs belonging to this family have a low incoherence parameter q , which limits the ability of species to feed on multiple diﬀerent trophic levels . Equally , the over - representation of triads S1 , S4 and S5 is to be expected as these are the only three triads out of 13 that can arise in a hypothetical food web with q = 0 , which is a value close to the empirical values of q for food webs in this fam - ily . The double link triads D1 - D8 are all under - represented or close to even , in agreement with our expectations . Family 2 is more interesting . Here the triads S1 , S4 and S5 no longer follow a strong pattern of over - representation and the double link triads D1 - D8 are not always under - represented . The most distinguishing feature , however , is the bulk over - representation of triad S2 , in stark contrast to Family 1 . We will argue in Section 3 . 3 that this is the main feature that separates the two food web families . This pattern of food webs belonging to two distinct families based on the under - or over - representation of triad S2 was already alluded to in [ 12 ] , however it was in disagreement with the predictions of the generalized cascade [ 34 ] and niche [ 31 ] models which can only produce food webs where S2 is over - represented [ 12 ] . In Section 3 . 3 we present results from our model introduced in Section 2 . 4 which show that it is possible to change the pattern of under - representation to over - representation of triad S2 by increasing the incoherence parameter q , thus providing evidence that trophic coherence can naturally give rise to two food web families characterized by low or high prevalence of omnivory , respectively . 0 10 20 30 40 Food web ID − 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 P e a r s o n r Pearson r Incoherence q Figure 6 : Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of the triad signiﬁcance proﬁles ( TSP ) . The coeﬃcient is measured between the empirical TSP and the average TSP in the model ensemble over 1000 simulated networks . Food webs are arranged by increasing incoherence parameter q . 3 . 2 Comparison between empirical and model networks We have also investigated the similarities of triad signiﬁcance proﬁles between the empirical food webs and model generated food webs . To this end we study 9 the similarity of the TSPs between each empirical food web and an ensemble of model food webs ﬁtted to the data of the empirical one . The results are summarized in Figure 6 . Averaging over an ensemble of 1000 model generated food webs ﬁtted to each empirical food web , we measured the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between the TSP of the empirical food web and the TSP of the ensemble average . The results show that for food webs in Family 1 ( ID 1 - 22 ) , the model is able to reproduce the empirical TSPs with high accuracy ( r ≥ 0 . 9 ) . For Family 2 ( ID 23 - 46 , excluding 30 , 35 , 40 , 43 ) , in most cases the same is true ( r ≥ 0 . 8 ) . The model fails to produce accurate TSPs for a number of food webs and sometimes even produces anti - correlated TSPs ( r < 0 ) . These sporadic food webs correspond to the ones that generally do not qualify for membership in either family as shown in the previous section . 3 . 3 The role of omnivory and basal species We now focus on the claim that the main diﬀerence between the two families of food webs is the relative under - and over - representation of triad S2 , or the degree of omnivory in a food web . A prevalence of triad S2 indicates that the species in a food web often feed on diﬀerent trophic levels , contributing to an increased incoherence parameter q as discussed in Section 3 . 1 . A scarcity of triad S2 , on the other hand , indicates that species only tend to feed on prey with similar trophic levels , which in turn signals a low incoherence parameter . This suggests a relationship between the z - score of triad S2 and network incoherence as measured by q . Furthermore , model results in Section 2 . 4 suggest that a high proportion of basal species to all species , B / N , produces more coherent food webs ( i . e . with a low incoherence parameter q ) . We take this as an additional predictive food web statistic for family membership . Our ﬁndings are summarized in Figure 7 . This is a scatter plot of all 46 food webs where we have plotted the ﬁtted model temperature T and the measured incoherence parameter q against the ratio of basal species to all species B / N . We observe a clear anti - correlation ( R 2 = − 0 . 74 ) that indicates a positive rela - tionship between how coherent a network is ( low q ) and how many of its species are basal . We have also coloured the markers of each food web to indicate the level of over - or under - representation of triad S2 as measured by the normalized z - score ˆ z S2 . Red circles indicate an over - representation while blue diamonds indicate an under - representation of S2 in the respective food web . Remarkably , based on this measure , we uncover two clusters of food webs corresponding roughly to the two families based on TSP similarities . The ﬁrst cluster is once again characterized by a high incoherence parameter q as well as a low ratio of basal species to all species B / N . The second cluster is characterized by a low incoherence parameter and a high ratio of basal species to all species . The two clusters roughly correspond to the two families as characterized by the TSPs , so we can conclude that , indeed , the main diﬀerence between the two families is the relative role of triad S2 as already observed in the bulk behaviour of the TSPs in Figure 5 . Finally , we study if our model exhibits a similar transition from a relatively S2 - poor to an S2 - rich state which would explain the relatively good agreement between empirical and model generated TSPs for the two families ( Section 3 . 2 , 10 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 Basal ratio B / N 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 T e m p e r a t u r e T 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 Basal ratio B / N 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 I n c o h e r e n c e q Under Over ˆ z S 2 Figure 7 : Scatter plots of the temperature T ( left ) and the incoherence parame - ter q ( right ) versus the basal species ratio B / N for all food webs . The gradient indicates the degree of over - representation ( red circles ) or under - representation ( blue diamonds ) of the feed - forward triad S2 as measured by the normalized z - score ˆ z S2 . The line shows the transition from over - representation ( above ) to under - representation ( below ) as observed in the model with N = 100 , h k i = L / ( N − B ) = 10 averaged over 100 runs . Error bars are approximate 95 % conﬁdence intervals . Figure 6 ) . We ﬁnd that for a given basal species ratio B / N there exists a critical temperature T c , and thus a critical incoherence parameter q c , which signiﬁes such a transition . For T ( and q ) below these critical values , the model generates networks where S2 is under - represented , while for values above critical , the networks generated have either an even or an over - represented number of S2 triads . We include the transition line of the two regimes in Figure 7 for an ensemble of 100 model networks with N = 100 species and an average ( non - basal ) degree h k i = L / ( N − B ) = 10 . Networks with q below the line show an under - representation of S2 triads , while networks with q above the line show an over - representation as measured by ˆ z S2 . Remarkably , the model results are in very good agreement with the empirical data despite the fact that both the network size N and the average degree h k i vary between the empirical food webs . Almost all food webs with an under - represented number of S2 triads fall below the transition line of the model while those with an over - represented number reside above the line . These ﬁndings are evidence that the distinction between the two families of food webs can be made based on the degree of omnivory present as measured by the prevalence of triad S2 . Furthermore , this inherently local property is intimately related to the global incoherence parameter q . Interestingly , based on the strong anti - correlation between q and B / N , the ratio of basal species to all species , both are equally good at determining which family a given food web belongs to . Finally , the realizability of networks belonging to either of the two families by our model suggests that the parameters q and B / N are both important in the mathematical modelling of food webs and may , in fact , be fundamental for understanding local preying patterns in food webs . 11 4 Discussion Our investigation of trophic interaction patterns in food webs on two diﬀerent scales reveals signiﬁcant correlations between the degree of omnivory , hierarchi - cal organization of trophic species and the density of basal species . First , our analysis of local trophic interactions via triad signiﬁcance proﬁles in empirical food webs reveals two distinct families of food webs characterized by a relatively low or high incoherence parameter respectively . While certain diﬀerences across families of food webs based on their TSPs have been observed before [ 12 ] , these have not been examined satisfactorily in the context of struc - tural diﬀerences in the food webs . Trophic coherence provides a global , network theoretic metric that enables us to classify and predict the relative prevalence of local trophic interactions . Second , we show qualitatively that the the main diﬀerence between the two food web families is the degree of omnivory , as measured by the over - or under - representation of triad S2 ( the “feed - forward loop” ) . There is therefore a link between global order ( trophic coherence ) and local preying patterns . Third , we test our prediction for the onset of omnivory using a new model for generating synthetic food webs with a given trophic coherence . We ﬁnd that the model exhibits a transition from an under - representation of omnivory to an over - representation of omnivory as a function of trophic coherence . The model results ﬁt the empirical food data very well , providing further evidence of the importance of capturing trophic coherence accurately in food web modelling . Finally , we analyse the impact of the density of basal species prompted by our exploration of the model . We ﬁnd that this parameter can be just as good a predictor of family membership as the trophic incoherence parameter . To conclude , food web motifs , an inherently local property , can be under - stood in the context of trophic coherence – a global food web property able to explain many features of food webs that have until now been at odds with estab - lished food web models [ 21 ] . We would like to emphasize that these ﬁndings are remarkably robust between food webs originating from vastly diﬀerent habitats . Further work should focus on what mechanisms result in trophic coherence as a food web evolves , the speciﬁc role of basal species in determining the degree of omnivory in a given food web , and the qualitative diﬀerences in the handful of sporadic food webs that do not appear to ﬁt well within this framework .

We also list , for each case , the number of species N , of basal species B , of links L , the ecosystem type , the incoherence parameter q , the value of the temperature parameter T found to yield ( on average ) the empirical q with our model , and the numerical ID used to represent the food web in several ﬁgures in the main paper . Note that the values reported here exclude cannibalistic links which have a small eﬀect on the resulting values of q and T .
