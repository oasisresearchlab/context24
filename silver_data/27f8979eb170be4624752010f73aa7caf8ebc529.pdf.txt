Burkhardt 1 1 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA ; and 2 Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , Yale University , New Haven , CT Actin dynamics during T - cell activation are controlled by the coordinate action of multiple actin regulatory proteins , func - tioning downstream of a complex net - work of kinases and other signaling mol - ecules . The c - Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase regulates actin responses in non - hematopoietic cells , but its function in T cells is poorly understood . Using ki - nase inhibitors , RNAi , and conditional knockout mice , we investigated the role of c - Abl in controlling the T - cell actin response . We ﬁnd that c - Abl is required for normal actin polymerization and lamel - lipodial spreading at the immune syn - apse , and for downstream events leading to efﬁcient interleukin - 2 production . c - Abl also plays a key role in signaling chemokine - induced T - cell migration . c - Abl is required for the appropriate func - tion of 2 proteins known to be important for controlling actin responses to T - cell receptor ( TCR ) engagement , the actin - stabilizing adapter protein HS1 , and the Rac1 - dependent actin polymerizing pro - tein WAVE2 . c - Abl binds to phospho - HS1 via its SH2 domains and is required for full tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 dur - ing T - cell activation . In addition , c - Abl is required for normal localization of WAVE2 to the immune synapse ( IS ) . These stud - ies identify c - Abl as a key player in the signalingcascade , leadingtoactinreorga - nization during T - cell activation . ( Blood . 2008 ; 112 : 111 - 119 ) Introduction T - cell activation involves regulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Signaling through chemokine receptors results in loss of microvilli and reorganization of actin ﬁlaments to generate a protrusive leading edge , integrin - rich domains associated with adhesion , and a trailing uropod . 1 - 3 Similarly , engagement of the T - cell receptor ( TCR ) results in the formation of actin - rich clusters of signaling molecules , which converge at the cell - cell contact site to generate the mature immune synapse ( IS ) . 1 - 3 Mutations in actin regulatory proteins are associated with immunodeﬁciency or autoimmunity , 1 emphasizing the importance of appropriate actin dynamics for the immune response . T - cell actin dynamics are controlled by the coordinate function of several proteins , including WAVE2 , WASp , and HS1 . 1 - 4 HS1 is a 75 - kDa protein expressed speciﬁcally in hematopoietic cells . It is related to the more widely expressed protein cortactin ( EMS1 ) , an oncogenic actin regulatory pro - tein . 5 Like WAVE2 and WASp , HS1 interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex to induce actin polymerization . 6 , 7 HS1 also binds F - actin ﬁlaments and prolongs their half - life in vitro , and is believed to function largely by stabilizing branched actin ﬁlaments generated by WASp and WAVE2 . In keeping with this , we have shown that HS1 - deﬁcient T cells generate actin - rich structures at sites of TCR engagement , but these structures are disorganized and collapse rapidly , resulting in defective T - cell activation . 4 HS1 differs from WAVE2 and WASp in that it is not regulated by Rho GTPases . Instead , HS1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to immunoreceptor ligation . 4 , 8 - 11 Several pieces of evi - dence indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 is important for its function . 12 - 15 Phosphorylation is required for HS1 recruit - ment to the IS , and for its ability to promote actin polymerization at that site . Phosphorylation also provides binding sites for SH2 - containing proteins , including Lck , Vav1 , and PLC (cid:1) . Interactions with HS1 stabilize Vav1 at the IS , 4 but the signiﬁcance of other SH2 domain interactions is unknown . In B cells and platelets , HS1 phosphorylation involves the synergistic action of Lyn and Syk . 10 , 12 Syk directly phosphorylates tyrosines 378 and 397 , an event that is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation at Y222 by Src kinases . 10 , 16 We have shown that Y378 and Y397 are the predomi - nant sites for HS1 phosphorylation in T cells stimulated by TCR cross - linking . 4 However , the relevant kinase has not been identi - ﬁed , and other signals may induce modiﬁcations at other sites . Regulation of T - cell actin responses requires upstream signaling through Src , Syk , and Tec family kinases . However , actin responses in other cell types also involve the Abl family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases . 17 , 18 This family consists of c - Abl and Abl - related gene ( Arg ) . Kinase activity of these proteins is tightly regulated in vivo , and translocation mutants give rise to oncogenic forms such as Bcr - Abl , Tel - Abl , and Tel - Arg . 19 , 20 Abl kinases have a highly conserved N - terminal region containing an SH3 domain , an SH2 domain , and the catalytic domain . The C - terminal portions , which are more divergent , contain actin - binding domains not found in other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases . 19 , 21 c - Abl is broadly expressed , and germ - line deletion leads to increased neonatal mortality . 22 Surviving mice exhibit severe defects in lymphocyte development and function , indicating that c - Abl plays an important role in the immune system .

Arg is expressed most abundantly in the brain , 21 , 25 and Arg - deﬁcient mice exhibit behav - ioral abnormalities but do not exhibit gross immunologic defects . 25 Thus , although there is recent evidence that Arg also functions in T cells , 23 it appears that c - Abl is the more important family member in lymphocytes . Because of their clinical importance , analysis of Abl function in T cells has largely focused on the effects of overexpressing constitutively active Abl and Arg translocation mutants . Relatively little is known about the normal role of c - Abl in T - cell biology . Recently , the Pendergast group has shown that TCR engagement activates Abl kinases , and that Abl kinases promote signaling events leading to IL - 2 production and proliferation . 23 , 26 This ﬁnding is consistent with recent reports that treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) patients with the Abl kinase inhibi - tor imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec , previously STI571 ; Novartis Pharma , Basel , Switzerland ) is associated with immunosuppres - sion in a subset of patients , possibly due to decreased numbers of CD4 (cid:3) T cells . 27 , 28 The mechanisms by which c - Abl promotes T - cell activation are not well understood . In other cell types , c - Abl has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm . 19 , 29 In the cytosol , one role of Abl and Arg is to regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics . 19 , 21 The importance of Abl / Arg as actin - regulatory molecules has not been investigated in T cells . Boyle et al recently reported that growth factor – induced actin responses in ﬁbroblasts involve tyrosine phosphorylation of the HS1 homolog cortactin by Abl family kinases . 30 We therefore asked if HS1 and c - Abl interact in a similar fashion during T - cell activation . Our results show that c - Abl is impor - tant for actin responses at the IS and for chemokine - induced T - cell migration . We ﬁnd that HS1 binds to and can serve as a substrate for Abl family kinases in vitro , and that c - Abl is required for full phosphorylation of HS1 in response to TCR engagement . In addition , we show that c - Abl interacts function - ally with other key molecules that work in concert with HS1 to shape the T - cell actin response . Methods Details regarding reagents , plasmids , and cell culture can be found in Document S1 ( available on the Blood website ; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article ) . Luciferase assays and IL - 2 ELISAs Jurkat T cells were transfected with 40 (cid:4) g of the indicated suppression vectors , together with 5 (cid:4) g of an interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) promoter - linked luciferase reporter plasmid ( pIL2 - luc ; gift from Dr David McKean , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) , and 50 ng of a TK - renilla reporter plasmid ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . After 48 hours , 10 6 cells were distributed into 24 - well culture plates and stimulated for 6 hours as indicated . Antibody stimulation was performed using 1 (cid:4) g / mL OKT3 with or without 1 (cid:4) g / mL (cid:5) - CD28 . Stimulation with antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) was performed by adding 5 (cid:6) 10 5 Raji B cells / well and SEE ( Toxin Technologies , Sarasota , FL ) to 1 (cid:4) g / mL . Samples were assayed on a Berthold LB960 Plate luminometer using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit ( Promega ) , and normalized for Renilla activity . To assay IL - 2 production , APCs were prepared by T - depleting mouse splenocytes by incubation with anti - Thy1 ( J1j . 10 ) and rabbit serum complement ( Pel - Freez Biologicals , Rogers , AR ) . Puriﬁed mouse primary T cells ( 2 (cid:6) 10 5 / well ) were incubated with APCs at a ratio of 2 : 1 with the indicated doses of 2C11 or SEB for 24 hours . IL - 2 in the supernatants was determined by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ; eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy was performed as described previ - ously . 4 , 31 Brieﬂy , CH12 or Raji B cells were stained with CellTracker Blue ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and pulsed with 10 (cid:4) M mouse cytochrome c 88 - 103 peptide or 2 (cid:4) g / mL SEE , respectively . B cells were conjugated to the appropriate T cells ( AND transgenic or Jurkat ) for 15 minutes ; ﬁxed ; labeled with anti - WAVE2 , bodipy - phallicidin , or rhodamine - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) ; and mounted using MOWIOL 4 - 88 ( Hoechst Celanese , Charlotte , NC ) . Cells were imaged on a Axiovert 200M microscope ( Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) using a 63 (cid:6) / 1 . 4 NA Plan apo objective . Images were collected using a Coolsnap FX - HQ camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc , Tucson , AZ ) , and nearest - neighbor deconvolution was performed using Slidebook version 4 . 0 software ( 3I , Denver , CO ) . Quantitation was performed by randomly selecting conjugates containing a T cell contacting a blue B cell ( for shRNA studies , selected conjugates contained a GFP (cid:3) T cell ) and counting conjugates showing a distinct F - actin band at the contact site . Conjugates scored as polarized typically exhibit average pixel intensities at the IS at least 2 times greater than at other sites along the T - cell surface . All analysis was performed by an individual blinded to experimental condi - tions . At least 50 conjugates were scored in each of 3 experiments . Data represent the average plus or minus standard deviation ; statistical analysis was calculated using a paired Student t test . Live cell imaging Time - lapse images of actin dynamics were collected as described previ - ously 4 on an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 , using an UltraVIEW LCI spinning - disk confocal ( Perkin - Elmer Life Sciences , Waltham , MA ) . Delta - T dishes ( Bioptechs , Butler , PA ) were coated with 20 (cid:4) g / mL OKT3 , blocked with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , and maintained at 37°C during imaging . Spreading was initiated by adding a concentrated cell suspension in serum - free RPMI , and images were collected every 5 seconds . Cell areas were determined in pixels using Slidebook . Video sequences were aligned based on initial contact with the coverslip and average cell areas were calculated for the population of cells for each 5 - second time point . Conjugate and chemotaxis assays Conjugate formation was analyzed as described . 32 For chemotaxis assays , T cells were resuspended at 2 (cid:6) 10 7 / mL in migration buffer ( RPMI 1640 , 1 % fetal bovine serum [ FBS ] , 25 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 0 ] ) and prewarmed to 37°C with 5 % CO 2 for 1 hour . ChemoTex chambers ( 96 - well , 5 - (cid:4) m pore size ; NeuroProbe , Gaithersburg , MD ) were ﬁlled with 30 (cid:4) L migration medium with or without 10 nm CXCL12 ( SDF - 1 (cid:5) ) or CCL21 ( SLC ; R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) in the bottom wells . A total of 5 (cid:6) 10 5 cells were applied to the upper wells , and chambers were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Cells in the upper wells were scraped , membranes were washed , and chambers were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes to collect cells trapped in the membrane . Migrated cells collected from the bottom wells were counted manually . Migration is shown as the average from triplicate wells , expressed as percentage of input cells . Determination of cellular F - actin content Puriﬁed mouse primary CD4 (cid:3) T cells ( 10 6 in 50 (cid:4) L phosphate - buffered saline [ PBS ] ) were incubated with or without 10 (cid:4) g / mL anti - CD3 ( 500A2 ; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) for the indicated times at 37°C . The reaction was terminated by adding 400 (cid:4) Lof 3 % paraformaldehyde in PBS . Fixed cells were washed once with ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorter ( FACS ) buffer ( PBS , 5 % FBS , 1 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02 % sodium azide ) , once with permeabilization buffer ( PBS , 0 . 1 % saponin , and 1 % FBS ) , and resuspended in permeabilization buffer containing bodipy - phallicidin for 112 HUANG et al BLOOD , 1 JULY 2008 (cid:1) VOLUME 112 , NUMBER 1 For personal use only . on April 19 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 30 minutes . After staining , cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer , resuspended in FACS buffer , and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . Cell stimulation , afﬁnity precipitation , and immunoblot analysis Jurkat lysates were prepared as described previously . 33 Cells were treated with or without imatinib mesylate or transfected with vector or shAbl - 3 , and stimulated with C305 for the indicated times . Alternatively , cells were treated with pervanadate to promote tyrosine phosphorylation . Whole - cell lysates made from 1 to 2 (cid:6) 10 7 cells were incubated with HS1 or CrkL antibodies for immunoprecipitations , or with GST - tagged SH2 domains for afﬁnity precipitation . The Rac1 / Cdc42 pull - down assay was done as described . 34 Proteins were resolved on 4 % to 12 % NuPage gels ( Invitro - gen ) , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and probed with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 680 antimouse [ Invitrogen ] or IR Dye 800 antirabbit [ Rockland , Gilbertsville , PA ] ) . Images were acquired and quantiﬁed using the Odyssey Imaging system ( LI - COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE ) . In vitro kinase assays A total of 5 to 10 (cid:4) g recombinant HS1 was incubated with 0 . 25 to 1 (cid:4) g recombinant Abl or Arg in 25 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM MnCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , and 100 (cid:4) M ATP . The reaction was conducted at 30°C for 30 minutes and quenched by adding 4 (cid:6) sodium dodecylsulfate ( SDS ) buffer and heating for 3 minutes . Proteins were resolved by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electophoresis and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine ( 4G10 ) and anti - HS1 . Results Abl family kinases bind to and phosphorylate HS1 We showed previously that HS1 functions in a phosphorylation - dependent manner to stabilize F - actin at the IS . 4 One role for HS1 phosphorylation is to mediate binding to SH2 domain - containing signaling molecules , including the Rho GEF Vav - 1 . Since the HS1 homolog cortactin was recently identiﬁed as a substrate for Abl family kinases in nonhematopoietic cells , 30 we asked if phospho - HS1 also interacts withAbl family kinases . As shown in Figure 1A , GST - tagged SH2 domains of both Abl and Arg bound to HS1 from activated T - cell lysates , and theAbl SH2 domain did so with similar efﬁciency to Vav - 1 . A control SH2 domain from CrkL failed to associate with HS1 , demonstrating speciﬁcity of the interaction . Interestingly , the Abl SH2 domain reproducibly bound more HS1 than the Arg SH2 domain ( Figures 1A , S1 ) . As one means of asking if Abl family kinases can interact with HS1 in cells , we used Ba / F3 pTET - ON p210 cells , which inducibly express the oncogenic form of Bcr - Abl . 35 Cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline to induce increasing levels of Bcr - Abl expression , and HS1 phosphorylation was assessed by immunopre - cipitation and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody . HS1 phosphorylation increased linearly with Bcr - Abl induction ( Figure 1B ) . To test whether Abl family kinases can phosphorylate HS1 directly , recombinant HS1 was incubated in vitro with recombinant Abl or Arg , and HS1 phosphorylation was assessed . As shown in Figure 1C , bothAbl andArg could phosphorylate HS1 in vitro . Incubation with c - Abl consistently resulted in stronger phosphorylation than incubation with Arg , again suggesting that HS1 preferentially interacts with c - Abl over Arg . Taken together , these results show that Abl family kinases can bind to and directly phosphorylate HS1 . c - Abl is required for full HS1 phosphorylation during T - cell activation To ask if Abl family kinases contribute to HS1 phosphorylation during T - cell activation , we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in Jurkat T cells treated with the Abl family kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate . To verify inhibition of Abl kinase activity , lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - CrkL , a well - characterized Abl substrate , and eluates were blotted for phospho - tyrosine 207 . 26 , 36 As anticipated , CrkL was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TCR cross - linking , and this was inhibited by treatment with imatinib mesylate ( Figure 2A top panels ) . ZAP - 70 phosphorylation at Y319 was also inhibited ( Figure 2A middle panel ) , conﬁrming the ﬁndings of Zipfel et al . 26 Like CrkL and ZAP - 70 , HS1 was tyrosine phosphorylated upon TCR cross - linking , and this was inhibited by treatment with imatinib mesylate ( Figure 2A bottom panels ) . Quantitation showed that at the peak of HS1 phosphorylation , imatinib mesylate treatment inhibited HS1 phosphorylation by 4 . 6 - fold . Although imatinib mesylate is highly speciﬁc for Abl family kinases , it was important to control for possible off - target drug effects . Moreover , pharmacologic treatment tests only the effects of kinase activity , and it is well known that Abl kinases engage in important kinase - independent adaptor functions . 24 , 37 , 38 We there - fore developed RNAi - based vectors to suppress protein expression . Because we cannot detect Arg expression in T cells using available antibodies , we focused on suppressing c - Abl . Two independent targeting constructs ( shAbl - 1 and shAbl - 3 ) were generated . Semi - quantitative Western blotting revealed that both constructs sup - pressed Abl expression by approximately 60 % to 70 % in a Figure 1 . Abl family kinases bind and phosphorylate HS1 . ( A ) JurkatTcells were treated with or without pervanadate for 10 minutes , and lysates were subjected to afﬁnity precipitation with the SH2 domains of indicated proteins . The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti - HS1 . ( B ) Ba / F3 pTET - ON p210 Bcr - Abl – inducible cells were treated with 1 (cid:4) g / mLdoxycycline for the indicated times . Bcr - Abl expression was assessed by immunoblotting of whole - cell lysates ( WCL ) . HS1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and phosphorylation was assessed by blotting for phosphotyrosine ( Anti - P - Tyr ) .

The results using both constructs were similar , however , since shAbl - 1 nonspeciﬁcally suppressed irrelevant target proteins ; only data obtained from shAbl - 3 are shown . Jurkat T cells transfected for 48 hours with shAbl - 3 were stimulated with SEE - pulsed APCs , and phosphoryla - tion of immunoprecipitated HS1 was assessed . Abl suppression reduced TCR - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 by approximately 50 % ( Figure 2B ) , conﬁrming that c - Abl contributes to HS1 phosphorylation . Interestingly , unlike treatment with ima - tinib mesylate , Abl suppression did not affect ZAP - 70 phosphoryla - tion , suggesting that the loss of ZAP - 70 pY319 may be due to an off - target effect of imatinib mesylate . Together with the inhibitor studies , these results demonstrate that c - Abl is required for efﬁcient tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in response to TCR engagement . Moreover , our data are consistent with the idea that c - Abl and ZAP - 70 each contribute to the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 . c - Abl regulates IL - 2 transcription during T - cell activation Since HS1 is required for IL - 2 promoter activation in response to TCR engagement , 4 we assessed IL - 2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells cotransfected with shAbl - 3 and a luciferase reporter linked to the IL - 2 promoter . Abl suppression reduced IL - 2 promoter activation in T cells stimulated with either anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 antibodies or with Raji B cells pulsed with SEE ( Figure 3A ) . These results are in agreement with the ﬁndings of Zipfel et al in imatinib mesylate – treated T cells . 26 As an alternate approach , abl ﬂox / ﬂox mice were bred to CD4 - Cre (cid:3) transgenic mice 39 to generate mice lacking c - Abl in the mature T - cell compartment . T cells from these abl ﬂox / ﬂox CD4 - Cre (cid:3) mice develop normally and exhibit normal levels of TCR and activation / memory markers ( data not shown ) . They do not express c - Abl protein ( Figure 3B ) . When these c - Abl – deﬁcient primary T cells were stimulated with anti - CD3 or SEB - pulsed APCs , they produced signiﬁcantly less IL - 2 than T cells from control littermate mice ( Figure 3C ) . c - Abl regulates actin responses during T - cell activation Although it is well established that c - Abl regulates actin dynamics in nonhematopoietic cells , its actin regulatory role in T cells has not been investigated . We and others have shown that disruption of some actin regulatory pathways ( eg , loss of Vav1 or WAVE2 ) leads to defects in T - cell conjugate formation , while disruption of other pathways ( eg , loss of WASp or HS1 ) does not . 4 , 40 , 41 To ask if c - Abl is required for APC binding , Jurkat T cells were treated with imatinib mesylate or transfected with shAbl - 3 to suppress c - Abl expression , and their ability to form conjugates with SEE - pulsed B cells was assessed by ﬂow cytometry . As shown in Figure 4A , conjugate formation pro - ceeded with normal efﬁciency . Thus , Abl , like HS1 and WASp , is dispensable for conjugate formation in this assay .

Conjugates formed using mock - treated T cells exhib - ited a bright band of F - actin at the IS ( Figure 4B ) . This response was inhibited by treatment with imatinib mesylate . Similar defects were observed in Jurkat T cells expressing the c - Abl suppression vector ( Figure 4C ) . Analysis of the frequency of conjugates showing a productive F - actin response revealed that inhibition of Abl kinase activity or suppression of c - Abl expression signiﬁcantly diminished F - actin responses ( Figure 4D ) . Since it is well known that T - cell tumor lines can exhibit signaling abnormalities , it was important to ask if c - Abl is also required for actin responses in primary T cells . We therefore used a ﬂow cytometric assay to assess activation - induced changes in F - actin content of naive mouse CD4 (cid:3) T cells . T cells from control mice exhibited a transient increase in F - actin content between 2 and 10 minutes after CD3 engagement ( Figure 4E ) . In T cells from abl ﬂox / ﬂox CD4 - Cre (cid:3) mice , however , the magnitude of the response was signiﬁcantly dampened and its duration shortened . To assess the role of c - Abl in antigen - speciﬁc actin responses , T cells from Figure 4 . c - Abl is required for actin polymerization in response to TCR engagement . ( A ) Jurkat T cells were transfected with control vector or shAbl - 3 .

Conjugates were then formed with CH12 B cells in the presence or absence of MCC88 - 103 peptide , and labeled with rhodamine - phalloidin . As in Jurkat T cells , Abl inhibition in primary T cells resulted in defects in actin polymeriza - tion at the IS ( Figure 4F , G ) . Taken together , these results show that c - Abl kinase function is required for actin polymerization in response to TCR engagement . In addition to its role in signaling at the IS , the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for chemokine - directed T - cell migration . To ask if c - Abl is required for chemotaxis , we assessed the ability of Abl - suppressed Jurkat T cells to migrate toward a gradient of CXCL12 . As shown in Figure 5A , Abl suppression dramatically reduced T - cell chemotaxis . Similar results were obtained with naive mouse primary T cells responding to the chemokines CCL21 and CXCL12 , which signal through CCR7 and CXCR4 , respec - tively ( Figure 5B ) . 42 We conclude that c - Abl is also required for T - cell migration . c - Abl is required for TCR - induced lamellipodial protrusion Endpoint analysis of ﬁxed conjugates reveals net effects on F - actin responses , but does not address how these effects occur . For example , T cells deﬁcient for either WAVE2 or HS1 exhibit similar defects in F - actin at the IS in ﬁxed conjugates , but video analysis reveals that WAVE2 - deﬁcient cells fail to generate actin - rich structures , whereas loss of HS1 leads to enhanced disassembly of these structures . 4 , 41 To visualize actin dynamics in the absence of c - Abl , Jurkat T cells stably expressing GFP - actin were transfected with shAbl - 3 or control vector and monitored by video microscopy while spreading on anti - CD3 coated coverslips . Control T cells ( Figure 6A ; Videos S1 , S2 ) exhibited normal spreading , character - ized by the formation of a round contact site and a broad , regular , actin - rich lamellipodium . However , Abl - suppressed T cells spread inefﬁciently and exhibited profound defects in the extent and persistence of lamellipodial structures ( Figure 6B ; Videos S3 , S4 ) . Measurement of spreading ( calculated as the average area of contact with the coverslip for the population of cells at each 10 - second time point ) shows that Abl - suppressed T cells fail to undergo the increase in footprint area characteristic of control cells ( Figure 6C ) . The difference in spreading was statistically signiﬁ - cant ( P (cid:8) . 005 at the 130 - second time point ) . This demonstrates that c - Abl is required for the organization of actin - rich protrusions in response to TCR stimulation . In this respect , the phenotype of Abl - deﬁcient T cells is more profound than that of HS1 - deﬁcient cells , suggesting that c - Abl also affects actin responses via additional , HS1 - independent mechanisms .

In parallel , we tested activation of Cdc42 , a related GTPase important for activation of WASP , which also been implicated in driving actin responses at the IS . 44 , 45 Jurkat T cells treated with imatinib mesylate were stimulated with anti - CD3 and the levels of activated Rac1 and Cdc42 were assessed . 34 As shown in Figure 7A , within 0 . 5 to 2 minutes after TCR stimulation , control T cells exhibited activation of both Cdc42 and Rac1 . Neither the magnitude nor the kinetics of activation was affected by treatment with imatinib mesylate . We conclude that Abl kinase activity is not required for Rac1 or Cdc42 activation in response to TCR engagement . Although Rac1 activation is likely to be necessary for WAVE2 activation at the IS , other factors are also required . WAVE2 functions in T cells as part of a larger protein complex , 41 and the mechanisms that regulate WAVE2 localization and activation at the IS are not well deﬁned . c - Abl has been implicated as a regulator of WAVE function because it binds to Abi1 / 2 , components of the WAVE complex , and can phosphorylate these proteins as well as WAVE itself . 46 , 47 We therefore asked if c - Abl is required for localization of WAVE2 to the IS , an event which is required for proper WAVE function . 48 Jurkat T cells transfected with shAbl - 3 or control vector were conjugated to Raji B cells , and localization of WAVE2 was assessed . As reported previously , 41 , 48 conjugates formed using control T cells exhibited WAVE2 labeling along the length of the IS ( Figure 7B ) , In conjugates formed with Abl - suppressed T cells , WAVE2 recruitment to the IS was still detectable , but the pattern of localization was highly abnormal . Rather than running continuously along the length of the cell - cell contact zone , WAVE2 was restricted to short regions of the interface or was punctate in distribution . This result indicates that c - Abl plays a role in organizing the WAVE complex at the IS . Discussion c - Abl is well established as an actin regulatory protein in nonhema - topoietic cells . 17 , 21 c - Abl binds to F - actin and localizes to actin - rich structures such as focal adhesions , lamellipodia , ﬁlopodia , mem - brane rufﬂes , and neuronal extensions and synapses . 17 Moreover , c - Abl interacts with numerous actin - regulatory proteins and pro - motes cytoskeletal rearrangements , leading to changes in cell shape and motility . 21 The role of c - Abl in hematopoietic cells is much less well understood , partly because the literature has focused on leukemogenesis associated with overexpression of constitutively active Abl translocation mutants , and partly because mice with germ - line mutations in c - Abl exhibit serious developmental abnor - malities . Recent work from the Pendergast lab shows that Abl family kinases are activated upon TCR engagement , and are required for TCR signaling events leading to efﬁcient IL - 2 promoter activation . 23 , 26 Our results support these ﬁndings , and additionally show that c - Abl is required for actin responses during both TCR and chemokine signaling . We ﬁnd that T cells lacking c - Abl or cells in which Abl kinase activity is inhibited fail to efﬁciently polymerize actin and extend actin - rich lamellipodia in response to TCR engagement . The effects of c - Abl suppression on actin responses at the IS are similar to those of inhibiting kinase activity , suggesting that the kinase activity of c - Abl , rather than its ability to bind F - actin , is most important in this context . In T cells , we have identiﬁed 2 actin regulatory proteins that interact functionally with c - Abl , HS1 and WAVE2 . We show that optimal TCR - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 depends on the expression of active c - Abl kinase . HS1 contains a reasonably good consensusAbl phosphorylation site at Y360 . The homologous tyrosine in cortactin ( Y421 ) is among the sites identiﬁed by Boyle et al as substrates for Abl / Arg phosphorylation . 30 Thus , HS1 may be directly phosphorylated by c - Abl at this site . We have shown previously that HS1 is phosphorylated at 2 distinct tyrosines , Y378 and Y397 , in a ZAP - 70 – dependent manner . 4 Zipfel et al have reported that Abl functions upstream of ZAP - 70 in the T - cell activation pathway , raising the possibility that Abl promotes HS1 phosphorylation indirectly , via ZAP - 70 . 26 However , since we observe defects in HS1 phosphorylation in Abl - suppressed cells , where ZAP - 70 phosphorylation is intact , we favor the idea that c - Abl and ZAP - 70 both phosphorylate HS1 . One interesting possibility is that ZAP - 70 and c - Abl might respond to distinct stimuli . For example , Abl family kinases are known in other cell types to respond to integrin ligation . 17 , 49 If ZAP - 70 phosphorylates HS1 primarily in response to TCR ligation , while Abl phosphory - lates HS1 in response to integrin binding , this could explain why HS1 phosphorylation is more sustained in response to activation by APCs . 4 Another intriguing possibility , not mutually exclusive with the ﬁrst , is that ZAP - 70 and Abl phosphorylate HS1 in a contingent fashion , as proposed for Syk and Src kinases . 10 Indeed , the 2 phosphorylation sites phosphorylated by Syk kinases in vitro , Y378 and Y397 , 4 lie within consensus binding sites for the Abl SH2 domain , 50 and we found that the SH2 domains of Abl family kinases bind to phospho - HS1 . This interaction could relieve the Figure 7 . c - Abl is required for WAVE2 localization independent of Rac1 / Cdc42 activation .

Additional study will be required to resolve the mechanisms by which c - Abl and ZAP - 70 function together regulate HS1 phosphorylation . Loss of c - Abl has a more profound effect on lamellipodial spreading than loss of HS1 , indicating that c - Abl functions upstream of additional actin regulatory proteins . 17 Indeed , it is known from studies in nonhematopoietic cells that c - Abl interacts with numerous actin regulatory proteins , including WAVE family members . 51 WAVE2 , the predominant WAVE isoform in T cells , is required for actin polymerization at the IS . 41 , 48 WAVE proteins are present as part of a larger protein complex , which includes the Abl - interacting proteins Abi1 or Abi2 , and c - Abl associates with the WAVE complex by binding to these proteins . 41 , 46 , 47 Moreover , in nonhematopoietic cells , c - Abl can directly phosphorylate WAVE2 at Y150 , leading to enhanced WAVE2 - dependent actin re - sponses . 46 , 47 However , we cannot detect WAVE tyrosine phosphor - ylation in T cells ( data not shown ) , which is consistent with a report from Nolz et al . 41 Abl can also phosphorylateAbi1 , 52 - 54 and a recent study in B cells shows that Bcr - Abl – dependent Abi - 1 phosphoryla - tion induces Abi / WAVE2 membrane localization . 55 This ﬁnding is in keeping with our observation that WAVE2 localization to the IS is defective in the absence of c - Abl . At present , we cannot exclude the possibility that the defects in WAVE2 localization are second - ary to other defects in IS structure , but it will be interesting to ask if c - Abl – dependent phosphorylation ofAbi1 / 2 is important for recruit - ment of WAVE2 to the IS . In addition to its role in controlling actin responses at the IS , we show that c - Abl contributes to the control of chemokine - induced T - cell migration . Studies in nonhematopoietic cells point to a role for c - Abl in controlling actin dynamics during cell migration 56 - 60 ; however , the mechanisms of Abl function in migration are unclear . In an effort to reconcile studies showing that c - Abl inhibits overall cell migration with other work showing that c - Abl promotes the formation of actin - rich projections , it has been proposed that c - Abl functions to prolong the exploratory phase of migration . 17 Another possibility is that c - Abl’s role differs in primary cells versus transformed cell lines . We found that loss of c - Abl expression inhibited chemokine - induced migration of both primary mouse T cells and Jurkat tumor cells . Additional study will be required to understand the mechanisms by which c - Abl promotes T - cell migration and to identify the relevant actin - regulatory proteins . WAVE2 and HS1 are likely downstream targets of Abl function in this pathway , but the role of these proteins in T - cell chemotaxis has not yet been tested . It is also likely that Abl controls T - cell migration by regulating integrin - dependent adhesion , via its known interactions with CrkL . While this manuscript was under review , a new study from the Pendergast lab showed that in addition to c - Abl , Arg plays an important role in T - cell function . 23 Parallel analysis of proliferative responses in T cells lacking one or both proteins indicate that these kinases play at least partially overlapping roles during T - cell activation . Like c - Abl , Arg functions to control actin responses in other cell types . 30 , 37 , 38 Thus , it will be important to ask whetherArg , like c - Abl , participates in controlling the T - cell cytoskeletal response , and whether loss of both family members leads to more profound cytoskeletal defects than loss of c - Abl alone . Finally , our ﬁndings have important clinical implications for treatment of patients with CML . Imatinib mesylate , a potent inhibitor of Abl / Arg kinases , selectively induces apoptosis of Bcr - Abl (cid:3) cells , and is remarkably successful in treating patients with CML . However , an increase in the incidence of some viral infections has been reported in patients with CML treated with imatinib . 27 Recent studies show that imatinib mesylate can inhibit T - cell proliferation , IL - 2 production , TCR - induced tyrosine phos - phorylation , and cell - cycle progression . 26 , 61 - 63 Our data indicate that imatinib mesylate also impairs T - cell actin responses at the IS , as well as T - cell migration ; however , potential effects on cellular immunity still need to be followed clinically in patients treated with this agent .
