Introduction Pathogenic microorganisms offer many advantages for eluci - dating cytoskeletal function and regulation . They exploit actin , microtubules , septins , and intermediate filaments ( IFs ) in diverse ways . They provide clear functional read - outs , such as infection efficiency or formation of distinct cytoskeletal structures . Finally , microbes often produce locally focused or exaggerated signals , facilitating the dissection of pathways that might be more diffuse or moderate in the host . Pathogens have helped us assign function to cytoskeletal proteins , discover new regula - tory modes , and unravel temporal and mechanistic interplay between factors controlling filament dynamics . In this review , we discuss four infectious processes that have shed light on the host cytoskeleton . The first is pathogen invasion , which exploits cellular uptake pathways that rely on actin , such as phagocytosis and macropinocytosis . Emerging evi - dence suggests that microtubules and septins also play roles in distinct entry pathways . The second process is establishment of a replication niche , which subverts cytoskeletal functions that nor - mally operate during membrane trafficking and cellular defense . Third , the actin - based motility ( ABM ) of pathogens through the cytoplasm mimics vesicle rocketing and has also illuminated host cell migration , whereas pathogen motility on the outer surface of the plasma membrane mimics a receptor tyrosine kinase signal - ing pathway . Finally , pathogen dissemination is an emerging field for which the endogenous processes are not defined . We draw examples from three decades of cellular microbiology , focusing on recent developments and on cases where pathogens ( mostly bacteria ) played particularly noteworthy roles in key discoveries . Bacterial invasion of host cells : Many doors , many keys Entry pathways converge on actin polymerization . Diverse bacteria invade nonphagocytic cells by stimulating endogenous uptake processes , such as phagocytosis and macro - pinocytosis . Actin polymerization is central to both of these processes , driving plasma membrane extensions that engulf ex - ternal cargo . Invading bacteria use a multitude of signaling molecules upstream of actin polymerization , and thus have con - tributed broadly to our understanding of actin regulation . Bacterial invasion pathways have historically been classi - fied into “zipper” and “trigger” categories ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ) . Zipper mechanisms , best studied for Listeria monocyto­ genes and Yersinia spp . , occur when specialized bacterial sur - face proteins bind host receptors that signal across the membrane to a phagocytic pathway , producing limited membrane rearrange - ment closely apposed to the entering bacterium ( Fig . 1 A ) . In trigger mechanisms , exemplified by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella ) and Shigella flexneri , the pathogen injects effector proteins across the host membrane , often via the syringe - like type 3 secretion system ( T3SS ) , in - ducing a bloom of actin - rich membrane ruffles that engulf the bacterium and nearby particles ( Fig . 1 B ) . Study of Salmonella invasion established that ruffles directly mediate macropino - cytosis , a process in which extracellular cargo is taken up non - selectively , and that ruffles produced by endogenous mechanisms , such as by growth factors , have identical uptake behavior ( Francis et al . , 1993 ) . Intracellular pathogens subvert the host cell cytoskeleton to promote their own survival , replication , and dissemina­ tion . Study of these microbes has led to many discoveries about host cell biology , including the identification of cyto­ skeletal proteins , regulatory pathways , and mechanisms of cytoskeletal function . Actin is a common target of bac­ terial pathogens , but recent work also highlights the use of microtubules , cytoskeletal motors , intermediate filaments , and septins . The study of pathogen interactions with the cytoskeleton has illuminated key cellular processes such as phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , membrane trafficking , motility , autophagy , and signal transduction .

Two effectors ( SipA and SipC ) directly interact with actin , nucleating and stabilizing filaments near the entry site ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Zhou et al . , 1999 ; Lilic et al . , 2003 ; McGhie et al . , 2004 ) . After a burst of poly - merization , a sixth effector ( SptP ) down - regulates Rho - family proteins by promoting their GTPase activity , restoring normal actin structure at the cell cortex ( Fu and Galán , 1999 ) . The bal - ance between Rho activation and inhibition is regulated both spatially ( Patel et al . , 2009 ) and temporally ( Kubori and Galán , 2003 ) . Thus , triggered entry is not a sudden event like the firing of a gun , but an elaborate , choreographed process . Is actin the only gatekeeper ? Although actin poly - merization is critical for uptake processes , roles for other fila - ment networks are being uncovered . Microtubule - dependent bacterial invasion has been reported for Campylobacter jejuni and Citrobacter freundii ( Oelschlaeger et al . , 1993 ) , two patho - genic strains of Escherichia coli ( Donnenberg et al . , 1990 ; Dhakal and Mulvey , 2009 ) , and even the well - studied Listeria ( Guzman et al . , 1995 ; Kuhn , 1998 ) and Salmonella ( Aiastui et al . , 2010 ) . Whether actin is also required in some of these cases is unsettled . A precise role for microtubules during entry Another lesson learned from bacterial entry is the central importance of the Arp2 / 3 complex in plasma membrane re - modeling . The Arp2 / 3 complex , when activated by nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) , nucleates branched actin networks . NPFs can be recruited to the plasma membrane and activated by Rho - family GTPases , leading to the formation of structures such as ruffles and phagocytic cups . Most invasive pathogens signal to the Arp2 / 3 complex during entry , although some ( no - tably Salmonella ) also exploit Arp2 / 3 - independent actin assem - bly pathways ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Zhou et al . , 1999 ; Hänisch et al . , 2011 ) . Recent work continues to impart informa - tion about the pathways that regulate the Arp2 / 3 complex . For instance , when the contributions of several NPFs to Salmonella invasion were quantified , genetic deletion of N - WASP was found to double expression of the NPF WASH in uninfected cells ( Hänisch et al . , 2010 ) . This suggests that WASH can partially compensate for the loss of N - WASP and is one of many ex - amples of cytoskeletal plasticity . A general lesson about actin polymerization is that it re - quires vigilant modulation to maintain cell function and viabil - ity . Salmonella illustrates this point , as it injects at least six effectors that control actin rearrangements during entry ( Haraga et al . , 2008 ; McGhie et al . , 2009 ) . Two effectors ( SopE and SopE2 ) activate Rho GTPases by mimicking host guanine Figure 1 . Bacteria exploit actin and microtubules to promote invasion and adherence . ( A ) Zippering bacteria express an invasion protein on their surface , which binds to a host receptor and initiates actin - dependent phagocytosis . ( B ) Triggering bacteria inject protein effector ( s ) across the host cell membrane , usually via a T3SS , leading to actin - dependent macropinocytosis . ( C ) Clostridium difficile transferase ( CDT ) , a binary toxin , is endocytosed by intestinal epithelial cells , and the A subunit is released into the cytosol ( left ) . CDT toxin ADP - ribosylates actin , promoting actin filament disassembly , effacement of microvilli , and release of cortical proteins that normally capture and stabilize microtubules . Unrestrained microtubule growth produces cellular extensions that wrap around external bacteria . 9 Pathogens illuminate the host cytoskeleton • Haglund and Welch endogenous processes . From them , host signaling molecules and post - translational modifications have been identified . For instance , Rac , a member of the Rho family , was discovered as a substrate of the Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin ( Didsbury et al . , 1989 ) , and the toxin was instrumental in elucidating the roles of Rac and Rho as signaling hubs , with Rac controlling membrane ruffles ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) and Rho controlling stress fibers and focal adhesions ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . Numerous post - translational modifications—including phosphorylation , glucosyl - ation , adenylylation ( AMPylation ) , ADP - ribosylation , proteolysis , and deamidation—can disable or activate Rho proteins . Both microbial and host proteins use these regulatory modes , as dis - cussed in a recent review ( Visvikis et al . , 2010 ) . A newly discovered variation on Rho modification is used by Photorhabdus luminescens , which ADP - ribosylates RhoA , preventing GTP hydrolysis and putting RhoA in a constitutively active state ( Lang et al . , 2010 ) . Previously characterized toxins that ADP - ribosylate Rho proteins , such as C3 toxin , target a different residue and inhibit Rho function . A second Photorhab­ dus toxin ADP - ribosylates actin , preventing  - thymosin from sequestering actin monomers , thus promoting polymerization ( Lang et al . , 2010 ) . Again , the toxin targets a different residue and has the opposite effect on actin function compared with pre - viously studied toxins . Together , these two Photorhabdus toxins promote rampant , disruptive actin rearrangements and inhibit phagocytosis . Although the relevance of these forms of regula - tion to endogenous processes is not clear , it is interesting that phagocytosis can be blocked by both up - and down - regulating actin polymerization . This emphasizes the theme that actin polymerization must be carefully controlled to produce useful results , and excessive assembly can bring the network to a halt . Constructing a niche After invasion , many intracellular pathogens remain within the membrane - bound entry compartment , modifying it to suit their needs . This requires subversion of diverse host pathways to acquire resources for growth while manipulating phagosome maturation to prevent destruction within lysosomes . Again Salmonella provides a useful example , as it expresses multiple effectors with overlapping and antagonistic effects on the cyto - skeleton ( Bakowski et al . , 2008 ; McGhie et al . , 2009 ) . We re - view how study of Salmonella led to the identification of a kinesin - interacting partner and potential new roles for cyto - skeletal motors in membrane trafficking . We then describe recent insights into IFs and septins , including possible roles in autophagy regulation , gleaned from the study of Chlamydia trachomatis , Shigella , and others . Salmonella regulates membrane trafficking via kinesin - 1 and SKIP . Salmonella replicates in a perinuclear compartment called the Salmonella - containing vacuole ( SCV ) , from which membrane tubules called Sifs ( Salmonella - induced filaments ) extend . SCV integrity was known to require micro - tubules , microtubule motors , and bacterial effectors secreted by the T3SS , including SifA . A key interacting partner of SifA is a host protein of previously unknown function called SKIP ( SifA and kinesin - interacting protein ; Boucrot et al . , 2005 ) . As the name suggests , SKIP interacts with kinesin - 1 in vitro and is required has been elusive , in part because the pathway ( s ) appear to be cell - type and strain specific . In the past few years , progress has been made toward defin - ing a mechanistic basis for microtubule dependence during bacte - rial entry . Several toxins made by Clostridium spp . were found to induce the temporary formation of long , microtubule - filled pro - jections that entwine bacteria and promote adherence ( Fig . 1 C ; Schwan et al . , 2009 ) . Although Clostridium do not invade cells , adherence is a prerequisite of invasion , so microtubule - based projections could promote entry by other pathogens . Interestingly , the toxins affect microtubules indirectly : they ADP - ribosylate actin , leading to actin filament disassembly , followed by release from the cell cortex of proteins that normally capture and stabilize microtubules ( CLASP2 and ACF7 ) . For a few hours after toxin application , microtubule - based projections dominate the cell morphology , followed by cell shrinking and rounding . Actin - depolymerizing drugs also induce microtubule - based pro - jections , albeit at lower levels . The exaggerated effect produced by Clostridium toxins could provide a tool for dissecting the interplay between actin and microtubules at the cell periphery . Intermediate filaments and septins might also contribute to bacterial entry . The intermediate filament vimentin has been implicated in invasion by Salmonella ( Murli et al . , 2001 ) and Escherichia coli K1 ( Chi et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , depletion of septin - 2 reduced invasion efficiency of Listeria and Shigella , and several septins localized around invading bacteria ( Mostowy et al . , 2009 ) . For Listeria , the effect of septin depletion was specific to one of two receptor - mediated internalization path - ways and varied with cell type , suggesting that septins partici - pate in discrete entry pathways . Cross talk between actin , microtubules , intermediate fila - ments , and / or septins occurs in many cellular contexts ( Rodriguez et al . , 2003 ; Chang and Goldman , 2004 ; Li and Gundersen , 2008 ; Gilden and Krummel , 2010 ; Spiliotis , 2010 ) , complicat - ing the demarcation of roles for each filament type . Further complications arise from findings that blur distinctions between different entry pathways ; for instance , zippering bacteria such as Listeria exploit the clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery , which is classically associated with smaller cargo ( Veiga and Cossart , 2005 ; Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . A systems biology approach , as proposed for viral entry ( Damm and Pelkmans , 2006 ) , could help untangle the pathways , and might clarify the variability across cell types . In this approach , RNAi knockdown of numer - ous host genes is combined with infection by a panel of patho - gens to define “functional modules , ” or host genes that function together during invasion . A broad panel of bacteria could reveal the number of separable entry pathways available in the host and define which cytoskeletal factors participate in each . Barring the door : Extracellular pathogens dis - rupt actin to prevent phagocytosis . In contrast to Salmonella , which dampens its effects on the cytoskeleton to maintain host cell viability , extracellular bacteria often treat cells more harshly . Many extracellular bacteria deliver toxins into host cells ; many of these toxins covalently modify cyto - skeletal factors such as actin and Rho - family GTPases , pre - venting uptake of the pathogen by phagocytic cells . Despite their destructiveness , these toxins’ modes of action pertain to JCB • VOLUME 195 • NUMBER 1 • 2011 10 disruption results in SCV dispersal ( Guignot and Servin , 2008 ) . Vimentin cages form around Anaplasma phagocytophilum inclu - sions , and a bacterial effector binds vimentin and indirectly pro - motes survival ( Sukumaran et al . , 2011 ) , supporting the hypothesis that caging is a protective , pathogen - controlled “nesting” process . In contrast , a distinct type of cage acts as a host - mediated trap that promotes destruction of the pathogen by autophagy . A proportion of cytosolic Shigella become wrapped in septin fila - ments , in a myosin II – dependent manner , concurrently with ac - quisition of autophagy markers ( Mostowy et al . , 2010 ) . Although initial cage assembly requires actin polymerization , an inverse correlation exists between the presence of a cage and productive ABM , and also between myosin activity and motility , indicating that a balance of cytoskeletal forces determines the fate of each bacterium . Because septin cages initially require , but then antago - nize actin polymerization , the authors looked for septins around other bacteria that undergo ABM . Septin cages were detected around Mycobacterium marinum but not Listeria or Rickettsia conorii , suggesting that caging is influenced by bacterial factors , which could provide routes to understand its regulation . The con - nection between septin cages and autophagy suggests a new cel - lular function for septins . Given that cellular aggresomes , which are vimentin cages surrounding protein aggregates ( Wileman , 2007 ) , are also linked to autophagy , it is tempting to speculate that certain filament assemblies simultaneously immobilize cyto - plasmic contents and mark them for autophagy . If this is true , then pathogens would be expected to evolve countermeasures to modify filament traps and avoid autophagy . For example , if vimentin acts as an autophagy signal , recruitment of additional filaments ( such as cytokeratins or actin ) might mask this signal . Intracellular patho - gens , by serving as both targets and manipulators of autophagy , are invaluable tools for investigating its regulation . Tiny rocket scientists : Diverse pathogens “discovered” actin - based motility Some bacterial species escape from the phagocytic vacuole and replicate freely in the host cytoplasm . A subset of these patho - gens expresses factors that trigger actin polymerization against their surface , producing mechanical force that propels them through the cell and facilitates spread to neighboring cells . for SCV integrity . However , the role of kinesin in SCV mainte - nance was puzzling because its recruitment appeared to be regu - lated both negatively ( by SifA ; Boucrot et al . , 2005 ) and positively ( by another effector , PipB2 ; Henry et al . , 2006 ) . A clue was pro - vided by the discovery that late after infection some SCVs moved toward the cell periphery before dissemination , in a manner de - pendent on microtubules , kinesin - 1 , and PipB2 ( Szeto et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , in uninfected cells , SKIP was found to promote antero - grade movement of late endosomes / lysosomes along microtubules ( Jackson et al . , 2008 ; Dumont et al . , 2010 ) , possibly through con - trol of membrane tubulation ( Ohlson et al . , 2008 ) or scission ( Dumont et al . , 2010 ) . At a mechanistic level , SKIP binds the late endosomal GTPase Rab9 , and SifA might mimic Rab9 ( Jackson et al . , 2008 ) . A model for SCV maintenance was proposed in which PipB2 recruits inactive kinesin - 1 to SCV membranes , where a complex containing kinesin , SKIP , and SifA forms ( Fig . 2 ) . SKIP could then activate kinesin , possibly through its interaction with the kinesin light chain , promoting the release of kinesin - associated vesicles ( Dumont et al . , 2010 ) . The lack of ki - nesin on SCVs could thus be explained by its rapid dispersal on SCV - derived vesicles . The precise biochemical mechanism of SKIP and kinesin on SCVs remains to be determined . It will be interesting to test this model and to see if analogous mechanisms operate on endogenous SKIP / Rab9 - positive compartments . Another interesting parallel between SCVs and endoge - nous compartments involves the actin - based motor myosin II , which was unexpectedly implicated in SCV positioning and in - tegrity ( Wasylnka et al . , 2008 ) . In uninfected cells , myosin II , together with Rab6 , contributes to vesicle fission from the Golgi apparatus ( Miserey - Lenkei et al . , 2010 ) . By analogy , in Salmonella - infected cells , myosin II might promote the release of SCV - derived vesicles , perhaps in cooperation with SKIP , kinesin - 1 , and SifA . The involvement of both myosin and kinesin in SCV - derived vesicle formation could point to new mechanisms of cooperation between actin - and microtubule - based motors . Filament “cages” : Nest or trap ? Actin and IFs also contribute to the establishment of replicative niches . In some cases , IFs , alone or with actin , form stabilizing cages around pathogen - containing vacuoles , apparently protecting them from host recognition . For example , Chlamydia trachomatis induces re - localization of the IFs vimentin , cytokeratin - 8 , and cytokeratin - 18 , as well as actin filaments , to the Chlamydia inclusion membrane ( Kumar and Valdivia , 2008 ) . IF and actin assembly around the inclusion are interdependent , and disruption of either leads to release of bacteria into the cytoplasm , triggering host defense mechanisms . Chlamydia regulates IF assembly in a novel way : the bacterial protease CPAF locally cleaves IF head domains , re - ducing their cohesiveness . Although the head domain of vimentin is essential for filament assembly in vitro ( Herrmann et al . , 1996 ) , the IFs cleaved by CPAF form complexes in vitro , and the head domain remains associated with cages ( Kumar and Valdivia , 2008 ) . Thus , proteolysis at an unidentified site in the head domain could represent a way to regulate the elasticity of IF networks , allowing cage expansion while maintaining structural integrity . Protective IF cages also coalesce around other intracellular bacteria . Salmonella vacuoles recruit the same three IF proteins as Chlamydia ( vimentin , cytokeratin - 8 , and cytokeratin - 18 ) , and IF Figure 2 . Model for kinesin - 1 and SKIP activity on SCV membranes . The T3SS - secreted Salmonella effectors PipB2 and SifA recruit kinesin - 1 and SKIP , respectively , to SCV membranes . It has been proposed that SKIP might then activate kinesin - 1 by binding to the kinesin light chain , and that SKIP – kinesin - 1 complexes promote tubulation and / or scission of SCV - derived membrane compartments , which are transported toward the plus end of microtubules . 11 Pathogens illuminate the host cytoskeleton • Haglund and Welch organization , and disassembly in lamellipodia were unknown . The comet tails produced by Listeria ActA or Shigella IcsA were highly similar to each other , suggesting that pathways controlling actin tail morphology were controlled by the host ( Kocks et al . , 1995 ) . It was clear that identifying host binding partners of ActA or IcsA would advance our understanding of cellular actin dynamics . The first ActA binding partner identified was the Arp2 / 3 complex , a conserved seven - subunit complex that was sufficient for actin assembly at the Listeria surface ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . At the biochemical level , the Arp2 / 3 complex weakly promoted actin nucleation on its own and was strongly activated by ActA ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . It was later determined that Shigella also exploits the Arp2 / 3 complex , but via a distinct mechanism : Shigella factors bind and activate host N - WASP , which recruits Arp2 / 3 and actin ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Leung et al . , 2008 ) . The importance of Arp2 / 3 in cellular processes was quickly recognized , and endogenous proteins such as WASP / N - WASP and WAVE were shown to activate Arp2 / 3 complex in the same manner as ActA ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . Collectively , these Arp2 / 3 activators became This form of motility evolved independently in Listeria , Shigella , Rickettsia , and Burkholderia , which each use a distinct mecha - nism driven primarily by a single bacterial protein ( Fig . 3 A ) , demonstrating that , in contrast to vacuole positioning , ABM may be simpler to achieve . Some viruses—vaccinia and other poxviruses ( Cudmore et al . , 1995 ; Dodding and Way , 2009 ) , and a baculovirus ( Ohkawa et al . , 2010 ) —also use ABM , al - though poxviruses trigger it from outside the cell . The study of pathogen ABM , particularly of Listeria , revolutionized our un - derstanding of cellular actin - based propulsion , such as vesicle rocketing and lamellipodia - driven cell migration . We review discoveries that established the ABM field , and then highlight recent studies that shed new light on actin dynamics . Motility through the cytoplasm . Actin’s importance for eukaryotic cell migration has been established for decades . It was inferred from the study of Listeria actin “comet tails” ( Tilney and Portnoy , 1989 ) that the motive force for lamelli - podia protrusion is derived from polymerization itself , rather than myosin activity along a cytoskeletal track ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . However , the mechanisms of actin filament nucleation , Figure 3 . Pathogens use distinct actin - based motility mechanisms . ( A ) Pathogens intercept actin assembly pathways at different levels . Vaccinia virus and EPEC express proteins ( A36R and Tir ) that mimic host phosphotyrosine motifs to recruit the adaptor protein Nck . Shigella and EHEC produce proteins ( IcsA and EspF U ) that recruit and activate N - WASP . Listeria ActA mimics N - WASP to activate the host Arp2 / 3 complex . Rickettsia bypasses host nucleators using the formin - like protein Sca2 to interact directly with actin . ( B ) The actin - based motilities of Listeria and Rickettsia have distinct host protein requirements . Listeria expresses ActA on its surface , which activates the host Arp2 / 3 complex , producing branched actin filaments . Actin monomers or profilin – actin complexes can polymerize onto filament ends in Listeria tails . Rickettsia expresses the formin - like protein Sca2 on its surface , which nucleates unbranched actin filaments and requires profilin for filament elongation . T - plastin is also important for Rickettsia tail formation . Both systems require capping protein and cofilin ( ADF ) . JCB • VOLUME 195 • NUMBER 1 • 2011 12 enteropathogenic E . coli ( EPEC ) demonstrated the physio - logical relevance of the phosphotyrosine / Nck / N - WASP pathway for signaling to actin assembly . After its elucidation , this path - way was found to be essential in kidney podocytes , signaling through the host receptor nephrin to produce the actin - rich cel - lular extensions that are critical for kidney filtration function ( Jones et al . , 2006 ) . Stimulated T cell antigen receptors ( TCRs ) also induce actin polymerization via Nck , although the pathway uses WASP instead of N - WASP ( Barda - Saad et al . , 2005 ) . Nck also signals to actin downstream of other receptor tyrosine kinases , including neuronal axon guidance receptors such as Ephrin A4 ( Fawcett et al . , 2007 ) and growth factor receptors such as PDGF - R ( Rivera et al . , 2006 ; Ruusala et al . , 2008 ) , although the downstream pathways and potential roles of Nck are not clearly defined . Nonetheless , pathogen signaling through Nck / N - WASP parallels several endogenous processes . Study of surfing pathogens has revealed dynamic inter - play between Arp2 / 3 , NPFs , and their regulatory partners . Vac - cinia virus was used to examine the recruitment and turnover of Nck , N - WASP , WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) , and Grb2 during motility ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ) . Surprisingly , although Nck and WIP are thought to recruit N - WASP , the turnover rate for N - WASP was much slower than for Nck and WIP , implying that other interactions stabilize N - WASP in vaccinia tails . Moreover , N - WASP did not turn over when its ability to stimu - late Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation was disrupted , suggesting that interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex is required to dissociate N - WASP from its binding partners . Presumably , this requirement also applies to N - WASP – mediated nucleation on rocketing vesi - cles , and possibly to other NPFs , although these hypotheses re - main to be tested . These molecular interactions have implications at the level of virus motility . The rate of N - WASP exchange cor - related positively with the rate of virus motility , but inversely with the number of tails , illustrating the need to balance speed with stability to achieve productive motility . Recent work with EPEC has revealed membrane phos - phoinositide signals that regulate actin assembly . The EPEC protein that recruits Nck , called Tir , also binds host phosphoinosi - tide 3 - kinase ( Sason et al . , 2009 ; Selbach et al . , 2009 ) and the inositol - 5 - phosphatase SHIP2 ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) . The combined activities of these two enzymes can convert PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , the predominant membrane phosphoinositide in wild - type pedes - tals . When SHIP2 recruitment is prevented , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 accumu - lates instead , and bacteria are associated with multiple , aberrantly long pedestals ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 down - regulates signaling after an initial burst of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - enhanced actin polymerization . The lipid requirements for EPEC pedestal formation might correspond to endogenous processes , particularly to TCR activation ( Smith - Garvin et al . , 2009 ) and down - regulation ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) and nephrin - mediated sig - naling ( Huber et al . , 2003 ; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . The clear read - out provided by EPEC pedestals could be useful for investigating the mechanisms by which PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 regulates actin assembly . Enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) , although closely re - lated to EPEC , uses a distinct mechanism of pedestal formation that has illuminated N - WASP regulation . Instead of Nck , EHEC Tir recruits the bacterial effector EspF U , which contains 2 – 6 known as NPFs . Additional NPFs , such as WHAMM , WASH , and JMY , continue to be identified and characterized , uncovering new roles for the Arp2 / 3 complex in processes such as ER - to - Golgi transport and endosome trafficking ( Rottner et al . , 2010 ) . Recapitulating Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated motility of bac - teria from purified components requires additional activities besides nucleation . Sustained movement was achieved using the following components : Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate filaments ; actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also known as cofilin ) to accelerate depolymerization and maintain the actin monomer pool ; and capping protein to prevent nonproductive growth of filaments away from the bacterial surface ( Fig . 3 B ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . Profilin , which binds actin monomers and enhances de - polymerization from pointed ends , increased the rate of move - ment but was not strictly required . This landmark study laid the foundation for elucidating the biochemical and biophysical bases of force production by actin assembly , which directly in - forms the cellular process of vesicle rocketing ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ; Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , the nucleation machinery and signaling molecules involved in ABM are substantially similar to those driving the protrusion of lamellipodia and pseudopodia , although these structures differ from rocketing particles in size and shape ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Bugyi et al . , 2008 ) . Reconstitu - tion of motility also provided a tractable system to dissect the activities of other proteins that regulate actin dynamics . To list just a few examples , it has been used to demonstrate filament capping by twinfilin ( Helfer et al . , 2006 ) , severing by villin ( Revenu et al . , 2007 ) , and enhancement of the N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 interaction by the adaptor protein Grb2 ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) . There is more to learn from pathogens moving through cyto - plasm . 22 years after Tilney’s micrographs of Listeria ABM , the biophysics of its propulsion are still being debated and tested ( Mogilner , 2006 ; Dickinson , 2009 ) . Furthermore , alternative mechanisms of ABM were recently discovered . Rickettsia is the first pathogen found to bypass the Arp2 / 3 complex for ABM ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) , instead encoding its own formin - like nuclea - tor ( Haglund et al . , 2010 ; Kleba et al . , 2010 ) . This type of motil - ity requires a different set of host factors compared with Listeria and Shigella ( Fig . 3 B ) . Specifically , profilin and the actin - bundling protein T - plastin ( fimbrin ) are critical for Rickettsia ABM ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) . Rickettsia may subvert an endogenous motility pathway , as host formins mediate the movement of oo - cyte chromosomes toward the cortex during meiosis I ( Li et al . , 2008 ) and might play a role in ER positioning ( Chhabra et al . , 2009 ) . Whether Rickettsia ABM will prove useful in understand - ing the transport of cellular cargoes remains to be determined . Motility across the membrane . A distinct “surf - ing” form of ABM is used by extracellular vaccinia virus and pathogenic strains of E . coli , which intercept receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways , resulting in the formation of a moving , actin - rich pedestal beneath the pathogen . Each of these microbes encodes a transmembrane protein that becomes phosphorylated by Src - and Abl - family kinases , leading to recruitment of the adaptor proteins Nck1 and Nck2 , which activate N - WASP to stimulate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Campellone , 2010 ) . Studies of vaccinia and 13 Pathogens illuminate the host cytoskeleton • Haglund and Welch junction protein Tuba—which has N - WASP binding , scaffold - ing , and GEF activity—negatively regulates protrusion forma - tion ( Rajabian et al . , 2009 ) , apparently by promoting cortical tension in epithelial cell layers ( Otani et al . , 2006 ; Rajabian et al . , 2009 ) . The Listeria effector InlC disrupts Tuba – N - WASP binding , relaxing cortical tension and promoting protrusions . Thus , protrusion formation appears to require an initial relaxation of cortical rigidity , followed by promotion of rigidity , presumably by a different set of factors , around the bacterial actin tail . Recently , the formin - family actin nucleators Dia1 and Dia2 were found to support dissemination of Shigella ( Heindl et al . , 2010 ) . As with ezrin , Dia1 and Dia2 localize to actin in protru - sions but not to cytoplasmic tails , and disruption of Dia reduces the frequency and length of protrusions . The involvement of formins , which generate long , unbranched actin filaments , is con - sistent with the parallel filament bundles found in protrusions . Together , the effects of formins , ezrin , vinculin , and cadherin on protrusions but not cytoplasmic tails suggest that a distinct set of actin regulatory factors interacts with motile bacteria after they contact the plasma membrane . Further study is required to de - termine which factors help build protrusions and how the transition repeated sequences that bind and activate N - WASP . Dissection of EspF U demonstrated the critical role of multivalency in N - WASP activation , as the repeated EspF U peptides activate effi - ciently only when they can recruit multiple copies of N - WASP ( Sallee et al . , 2008 ) . Isolated EspF U peptides bind N - WASP but do not promote robust actin polymerization ( Campellone et al . , 2008 ; Sallee et al . , 2008 ) . The importance of oligomerization as a universal mode of NPF regulation is supported by in vitro work showing that dimerized NPF activation domains have  100 times greater affinity for ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ) and ac - tivity toward the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Padrick et al . , 2008 ) compared with monomeric NPFs . Oligo - merization could also explain results in uninfected cells in which artificial clustering of WASP or an upstream binding partner at the plasma membrane stimulated actin polymeriza - tion ( Castellano et al . , 1999 ; Rivera et al . , 2004 ) . As with cytoplasmic ABM , more remains to be learned from surfing pathogens . For instance , even the well - studied molecule EPEC Tir contains peptides whose effects on actin pedestals are not understood ( Campellone , 2010 ) . Intriguingly , both EPEC and host nephrin use secondary mechanisms of actin assembly in addition to the primary phosphotyrosine / Nck - dependent pathway , so additional parallels might exist be - tween the two systems . Finally , EHEC EspF U can be used to explore how cells generate plasma membrane protrusions inde - pendently of tyrosine kinase signaling . New directions : Pathogen exit and dissemination Pathogens can quickly consume a host cell’s resources and must spread to new cells to continue their life cycle . Although host cell lysis can promote spread , it is often advantageous for micro - organisms to exit cells in a controlled , nonlytic manner . Less is known about molecular mechanisms of dissemination com - pared with entry or intracellular motility , but several exit strate - gies use the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 4 ) . It is likely that normal host cell processes are exploited during exit , but these processes are poorly defined . This makes pathogen exit an exciting area for future research . Bacteria that undergo ABM , such as Listeria and Shigella , subsequently enter long , plasma membrane – bound protrusions that extend from infected cells into adjacent cells ( Tilney and Portnoy , 1989 ; Kadurugamuwa et al . , 1991 ) and escape into the neighboring cell’s cytoplasm ( Robbins et al . , 1999 ; Monack and Theriot , 2001 ) . Within protrusions , actin tail filaments be - come longer and more densely bundled ( Sechi et al . , 1997 ; Gouin et al . , 1999 ) and more stable ( Robbins et al . , 1999 ) . Host adherens junction proteins , such as vinculin ( Kadurugamuwa et al . , 1991 ) and cadherins ( Sansonetti et al . , 1994 ) , have been implicated in protrusion - mediated spread . Because cadherin cyto - plasmic domains link to actin filaments via vinculin and other junction components , it was speculated that junction proteins might bind comet tails , altering actin filament organization and promoting the formation and rigidity of protrusions . Analo - gously , disruption of ezrin , an actin membrane linker that local - izes to Listeria protrusions but not cytoplasmic tails , results in short , crumpled protrusions ( Pust et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , the Figure 4 . Exit strategies of diverse intracellular pathogens use actin . Chla - mydia ( yellow ) vacuoles are extruded through a cortical constriction , and the plasma membrane seals around the constriction point in a manner dependent on actin ( red ) , releasing a double - membrane – bound bacterial compartment . The extrusion pathway appears to require myosin II and N - WASP for initiation and Rho for detachment of the extruded vacuole from the host cell . Listeria and Shigella ( green ) , propelled by actin - based motility , enter plasma membrane protrusions and are taken up by neigh - boring cells . Cadherins , ezrin , mDia , and vinculin have been implicated in protrusion formation . Mycobacterium ( purple ) exits cells through a plasma membrane break surrounded by a barrel - shaped ejectosome rich in actin , myosin IB , and coronin . In host cells lacking RacH , ejectosomes are not detected and mycobacterial spreading is impaired . Cryptococcus ( blue ) phagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane , and intermittent actin poly - merization around the phagosome , apparently mediated by N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex , inhibits this fusion . JCB • VOLUME 195 • NUMBER 1 • 2011 14 transferrin - coated beads , on mechanically induced plasma mem - brane wounds , and at membrane invaginations around particles too large to phagocytose ( Yam and Theriot , 2004 ) , demonstrating that flashing is an endogenous process , induced by membrane break - age and possibly by the presence of large internalized particles . Although dynamic actin accumulates around plasma membrane wounds , the role of actin polymerization on phagosomes is less clear . Actin might contribute to membrane repair , or could form a barrier to limit mixing of vesicle contents with cytosol while other repair mechanisms occur . In either case , actin polymeriza - tion appears to help maintain the integrity of phagosomes . Collectively , these reports will lead to further discoveries about the roles of actin in ushering pathogens or other particles out of cells , including insights into membrane resealing . As men - tioned in the Introduction , the endogenous pathways exploited during pathogen exit are not defined , and it is currently unknown if other cytoskeletal filaments are involved in these processes . Future perspectives Given the numerous ways in which pathogens have contributed to our understanding of the cytoskeleton , it is obvious that fu - ture study of pathogen – cytoskeleton interactions will uncover important new insights . In particular , pathogens might reveal clues to the role ( s ) of actin in the nucleus , an area that is just be - ginning to be explored ( Skarp and Vartiainen , 2010 ) . For in - stance , baculovirus replication requires nuclear translocation and polymerization of actin ( Goley et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , Anaplasma phagocytophilum induces phosphorylation of actin in its host , leading to increased nuclear G - actin and phospho - actin – dependent up - regulation of a host gene required for bac - terial survival ( Sultana et al . , 2010 ) . Pathogens have additional tricks up their sleeves that were not discussed in this review , such as destabilization ( Coureuil et al . , 2009 ) or reinforcement ( Kim et al . , 2009 ) of intercellular junctions , as well as promo - tion of host cell motility ( Worley et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that insights into these processes will be forthcoming . Advance - ments will also come from technological improvements , for ex - ample in imaging methods , as well as new approaches , such as systems - level analyses and mathematical modeling . In addition to revealing fundamental cellular mechanisms , future studies of the host – pathogen relationship will enhance our understanding of pathogenesis and disease , and may lead to improved diag - nostics and treatments for microbial infections .

Moreover , how these cytoskeletal alterations promote uptake by neighboring cells is unclear . In uninfected cells , uptake of vesicles derived from neighboring cells was observed and was named paracytophagy ( Robbins et al . , 1999 ) , but paracytophagy’s role in cells and its connection to protrusion - mediated spread have not been described . Another actin - dependent mode of exit is the extrusion of Chlamydia inclusions into the extracellular space ( Hybiske and Stephens , 2007 ) . Compartments containing a few to hundreds of Chlamydia , surrounded by both inclusion and plasma mem - branes , were observed to balloon out from a constriction point in the host cell , eventually being released into the media . Extrusion requires actin , N - WASP , and myosin II , and the final pinching - off step requires the GTPase Rho . Chlamydia have a second , lytic exit strategy , and usually both mechanisms are used with equal frequency . Curiously , the authors found that jasplakinolide , which blocks actin depolymerization but not polymerization , abrogated the lytic strategy and quickly induced extrusions , even early in infection when Chlamydia do not nor - mally exit . This suggests that robust actin polymerization is sufficient to induce extrusion , which implies that it is a host - driven process . However , the endogenous function of extru - sion , if any , remains a mystery . A third actin - dependent exit strategy was recently described for Mycobacterium marinum and M . tuberculosis ( Hagedorn et al . , 2009 ) . These bacteria , which spend part of their life cycle free in the host cytoplasm , exited host amoebae through a barrel - shaped structure rich in actin , myosin IB , and coro - nin , which the authors called an ejectosome . Ejection oc - curred without long membrane extensions , did not require a comet tail or a recipient cell , and took only a few minutes to complete , distinguishing it from protrusion - mediated spread . Ejection resulted in plasma membrane breakage and exit into either the media or an adjacent cell , which formed a phagocytic cup – like structure around the invading bacterium . In spite of membrane rupture , leakage of cellular contents did not occur , apparently due to a tight septum formed by the actin ring . The authors proposed that ejectosomes might have originated as a plasma membrane resealing mechanism . Actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction occur around plasma membrane wounds ( Mandato and Bement , 2001 ) , but this process uses myosin II ( Mandato and Bement , 2001 ; Togo and Steinhardt , 2004 ) , whereas myosin II was not detected at ejectosomes . Thus , the connection between ejectosomes and plasma mem - brane repair pathways requires further investigation . A membrane - sealing function might also explain the cycles of transient actin polymerization observed around phago - somes containing the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans ( Johnston and May , 2010 ) or bacteria such as Listeria ( Yam and Theriot , 2004 ) . In the case of Cryptococcus , actin “flashes” fol - low phagosome permeabilization events , in an Arp2 / 3 complex – and WASP / N - WASP – dependent manner . Cryptococcus exits cells by phagosomal fusion with the plasma membrane , and fu - sion is usually preceded by phagosome permeabilization . In con - trast to the above strategies , disruption of actin assembly enhances fungal exit , implying that host cells polymerize actin to limit dis - semination . Flashes were also observed on phagosomes containing 15 Pathogens illuminate the host cytoskeleton • Haglund and Welch Egile , C . , T . P . Loisel , V . Laurent , R . Li , D . Pantaloni , P . J .
