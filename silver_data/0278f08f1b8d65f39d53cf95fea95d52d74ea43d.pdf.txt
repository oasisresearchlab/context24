The functional impact of condensates on RNA biology relies on the residence time of individual RNA molecules within a condensate 3 , which is governed by intra - condensate diffusion 4 ‚Äì the slower or more confined the diffusion , the longer the residence time . However , the spatiotemporal organization of RNA and protein diffusion within a single condensate remains largely unknown due to the challenge of accurately profiling intra - condensate diffusion behaviors down to the single - molecule level . Here we introduced a general condensate - tethering approach that allows single molecule tracking ( SMT ) of fluorescently labeled proteins and RNAs within non - wetted spherical 3D condensates without the interference of condensate motions . We found that a significant fraction of RNA and protein molecules are locally confined , rather than freely diffusive , within a model condensate formed by full - length , tag - free , RNA - binding protein Fused - in - Sarcoma ( FUS ) , known for its critical roles in RNA biology under both physiological and pathological conditions 5 . Dynamic Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography ( PAINT ) 6 reconstruction further revealed that RNA and proteins are confined to distinct slow - moving nanometer - scale regions , termed nanodomains , within a single condensate . Remarkably , nanodomains affect the diffusion but not the density of the confined biomolecules , supporting local percolation 1 , 7 rather than a secondary phase separation within the condensate as their origin . Beyond their regulatory roles on RNA residence time , nanodomains engender both elevated local connectivity and altered chemical environment , a prerequisite for pathological liquid - to - solid transition of FUS during aging . In summary , our study uncovers a patterned spatial organization of both protein and RNA molecules within a single condensate , revealing distinct diffusion dynamics that affect molecular retention time and interactions underlying cellular function and pathology . 2 Main Both protein and RNA molecules can phase separate into biomolecular condensates that regulate cellular activities by organizing biochemical reactions 1 , 7 - 9 . Co - assembled ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) granules play critical roles in RNA metabolism 2 such as transcription 10 - 12 , splicing 12 - 14 , translation 15 , 16 , and decay 17 , 18 under both physiological and pathological conditions 9 . Proteins often serve as scaffold molecules that drive the phase separation , and RNAs usually partition into a condensate as guest molecules 8 , 19 , 20 . Cellular functions of RNP granules rely on the selective recruitment of RNA guest molecules and their corresponding processing machineries into condensates 1 , 2 , 8 , 19 , 20 , as well as the resulting modulation of biochemical reaction rates 21 , 22 . Since all biological processes are time - dependent , information on how long an RNA molecule resides in a condensate and how the internal architecture of the condensate regulates intra - condensate diffusion are crucial , yet underexplored . Single - molecule tracking ( SMT ) by fluorescence microscopy has provided evidence of distinct interaction kinetics of RNAs with RNP granules in cells based on RNA functionality 3 , 23 - 25 , but intracellular SMT generally lacks the spatiotemporal resolution needed to reveal intra - condensate diffusion . Complementary pioneering work using SMT in vitro has demonstrated different diffusive states and local chemical environments within condensates , with such measurements typically limited to proteins or organic dyes 26 - 33 . To gain deeper insight into the spatiotemporal organization of both protein scaffold and RNA guest molecules within RNP granules , we sought to identify and overcome the obstacles to accurate SMT within 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) condensates . Previous intra - condensate SMT experiments have been performed in condensates with protein 32 or RNA 34 components tethered to a membrane , forming flattened , wetted domains that have material properties distinct from those of spherical 3D condensates assembled via phase separation in bulk solution 35 , 36 . Even in the absence of membrane - tethering , condensates can still form wetted domains on glass surfaces due to non - specific protein absorption , which has not been systematically excluded in most studies 26 - 28 , 30 , 31 . Spherical 3D condensates can be preserved by proper surface passivation 33 , but condensates on passivated glass surfaces can exhibit rotational or translational motions that interfere with the SMT of slowly diffusing molecules . Therefore , a system that both preserves 3D condensate shape and eliminates interference from whole - condensate motions is critical for accurate intra - condensate SMT . Here we achieved accurate , simultaneous intra - condensate SMT of protein and RNA molecules by optimizing a general multi - tether approach that restricts condensate motion without inducing surface wetting . We chose Fused - in - Sarcoma ( FUS ) protein as our model RNP granule scaffold to assemble biomolecular condensates in vitro , since it regulates transcription , splicing , DNA - damage repair , and stress response by forming a variety of physiological and pathological condensates 5 , 37 - 40 . Notably , disease - related mutations of FUS have been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and other neurodegenerative diseases , where mutants accelerate the liquid - to - solid phase transition of FUS condensates in a process termed aging , causing the pathological fibrilization of FUS within neurons 39 , 41 - 45 . We purified full - length tag - free FUS 46 , 47 to obtain condensates devoid of perturbations from protein truncations or purification tag and fluorescent protein appendages 48 . In contrast to the highly liquid - like material properties of these condensates , significant fractions of the constituting FUS scaffold molecules and model firefly luciferase ( FL ) messenger RNA ( mRNA ) guest molecules were found to be confined , rather than freely diffusive . Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography ( PAINT ) reconstructions based on SMT trajectories directly visualized the underlying architecture that confines diffusion , defined by dynamic nanometer - scale regions within a single condensate . These nanodomains restrict the diffusion of molecules based on their size , shape , and charge , 3 leading to distinct protein and RNA diffusion behaviors within a condensate . The sub - condensate architecture observed here may form the basis for a spatial regulation of biochemical reactions that affect specific RNA and protein molecules in an RNP granule , including the fibrilization of FUS and aggregation of RNA . Tethering enables SMT in liquid - like , full - length , tag - free FUS condensates The N - terminal prion - like domain ( PrLD , 1 - 239 aa ) of FUS has been widely used as a model system to study phase separation 49 - 52 . We reasoned that the full - length protein contains C - terminal regions with structural and electrostatic features that may also affect condensate properties ( Fig . 1a , b ) . To investigate condensates that most closely approximate a physiological scaffold protein behavior , we purified FUS in its full - length tag - free form , adapting a recently described protocol featuring multiple ion - exchange chromatography steps and an optimized refolding protocol with ùõΩùõΩ - cyclodextran 46 , 47 ( Fig . S1 ) . In addition , the FL guest mRNA ~ 1 , 500 nucleotide ( nt ) in length was generated with the features necessary for intracellular translation , including a 5‚Äô - cap , a 5‚Äô untranslated region ( UTR ) , and a poly - A tail ( Fig . 1a , Fig . S1 ) . For fluorescence - based SMT , we used click - chemistry to covalently attach minimally disruptive 53 organic dye molecules between the coding sequence and unmodified poly - A tail ( Fig . 1a , Fig . S1 ) . To characterize the phase separation of full - length tag - free FUS , we triggered condensation by diluting a stock solution of FUS to a physiological concentration of 10 ¬µM FUS found in Hela cell nucleus 39 . Condensates were generally imaged within 30 minutes of assembly to avoid aging . We first determined the phase diagram ( Fig . S2 ) , which shows a binodal curve similar to previous reports for truncated or tagged FUS 39 , 54 . Next , we measured the condensate fusion kinetics using microrheology in a dual - trap optical tweezers setup ( Fig . 1c ) . When the probing trap ( purple , Fig . 1c ) approaches the measurement trap ( orange , Fig . 1c ) at constant speed , the coalescence of the two condensates generates an increasing force on the measurement trap due to surface tension , accompanied by a decrease in total area of the condensates ( Fig . 1c ) . The force curve upon transitioning from touching to fully fused droplets was used to extract the characteristic fusion time ùúèùúè 39 , 54 ( Fig . 1d ) . The distribution of ùúèùúè values ( Fig . 1e ) exhibits significantly faster fusion ( ùúèùúè ! " # $ = 51 ¬± 4 ms ) than reported for tagged versions of FUS ( ùúèùúè ! " # $ = ~ 150 ms for green fluorescence protein - labeled FUS 39 , ùúèùúè ! " # $ = ~ 570 ms for maltose - binding protein - labeled FUS 54 ) . Taken together , these observations suggest that full - length tag - free FUS forms highly liquid condensates with phase - separation properties distinctive from commonly used truncated or tagged FUS models . To visualize entire condensates using highly inclined and laminated optical sheet ( HILO ) 55 microscopy , we doped 10 nM sparsely AlexaFluor488 - labeled FUS ( FUS - AF488 ) into the condensation reaction , whereas to perform SMT and measure the intra - condensate diffusion of single biomolecules we added 50 pM fluorescently labeled protein or RNA . Without tethering , we observed that condensates moved laterally on a polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - passivated surface ( Fig . 1f ) . In addition , SMT trajectories of mRNA molecules within the same condensate were highly correlated , suggesting a significant contribution from both translational and rotational motions of the entire condensate ( Fig . 1g ) . Previously reported intra - condensate SMT trajectories of relatively small proteins appear to have been less affected 27 , 28 , 30 - 32 , suggesting that the comparably slow diffusion of mRNA molecules elevates this challenge . To prevent this interference of condensate motions with intra - condensate SMT observation , we developed a PEG - biotin : streptavidin : FUS - biotin tethering system , wherein the fraction of PEG - biotin controls tether density , and extensive washing prevents the contamination of condensates with streptavidin or FUS - biotin ( Fig . 1h ) . Notably , after optimizing the tether density to avoid surface wetting , we observed surface - captured FUS condensates that were spherical in both the x - y 4 plane ( Fig . 1i , Fig . S3 ) and the x - z plane ( Fig . 1j ) , rather than the previously reported flattened wetted domains 32 - 34 . Moreover , the uniform distribution of fluorescence intensity across the bulk fluorescence image of a tethered condensate ( Fig . 1i ) confirms that our full - length tag - free FUS condensates consisted of a single phase , rather than the multiphase organization of RNP granules assembled using multiple scaffolds 56 . Overall , multi - tethering provides an adaptable platform for accurate SMT within highly liquid - like , single - phase , full - length tag - free FUS condensates ( Fig . 1h , # 1 - 3 ) , as exemplified by the uncorrelated mRNA diffusion trajectories in the HILO cross - section imaging plane of an individual condensate ( Fig . 1k ) .

All scale bars are 1 ¬µm . Nanodomains govern intra - condensate diffusion patterns To systematically profile heterogeneous intra - condensate diffusion behaviors ( Fig . 2a ) , we developed a pipeline that categorizes SMT trajectories by diffusion type ( Fig . 2a - b ) and assesses population - wide shifts via distributions of specific observed metrics ( Fig . 2c ) . Generally , in the absence of active transport SMT trajectories can be assigned to one of three diffusion types : immobile , confined diffusion , and normal diffusion ( Fig . 2a ) , which are distinguished by the mean step size of a trajectory and the anomalous diffusion component a calculated from fitting the trajectory‚Äôs mean squared displacement ( MSD ) - lag time ( ùúèùúè ) ( Fig . 2a - b ) . Immobile trajectories have step sizes smaller or similar to the mean localization error ( Fig . S4 ) so that a 30 nm threshold was used to distinguish mobile from immobile trajectories ( Fig . 2b ) . For mobile trajectories , confined diffusion yields a < 1 while normal diffusion ideally exhibits a = 1 . Since a is usually underestimated when fitting experimental data 59 , a more practical threshold of 0 . 7 was used instead of 1 to distinguish normal from confined diffusion trajectories ( Fig . 2b ) . The a estimates from single trajectories followed a broad distribution ( Fig . 2c ) so that we used the distribution of angles between steps calculated from all trajectories ( Fig . 2c ) as an orthogonal metric to quantify how significantly molecules were confined . An angle distribution 6 skewing towards 180¬∞ is expected for confined particles because they bounce back when approaching their confinement boundary , where 0¬∞ is defined as no change in directionality and 180¬∞ as a complete turn - back . In contrast , a uniform angle distribution is expected for normal diffusion , due to its isotropic nature . For normal diffusion trajectories , we used both MSD - ùúèùúè fitting ( Fig . S5 ) and a Bayesian statistics - based state array ( SA ) method 60 ( Fig . 2c ) to estimate the distribution of apparent diffusion coefficients ( D app ) . To test the resulting diffusion - profiling pipeline , we used 20 - nm and 200 - nm polystyrene beads in the dilute phase outside of condensates as a normal diffusion control . We confirmed signatures of normal diffusion in both of these controls , with a normal diffusion fraction of 65 - 76 % , an a distribution peak at 1 , a uniform angle distribution , and single sharp peaks in the D app distribution . As expected from the Stokes - Einstein diffusion law , the peak for the 20 - nm beads was shifted from that of the 200 - nm beads roughly by a factor of 10 ( Fig . S6 , Table S1 ) . Notably , the diffusion profile of single FL mRNA molecules in the dilute phase matched well with that of the 20 - nm beads ( Fig . 2c , Fig . S6 ) , further validating our pipeline because the radius of gyration for such a 1500 - nt RNA was previously determined to be ~ 20 nm 61 . Collectively , these results indicate that our pipeline is well suited to categorize diffusion behaviors within an SMT dataset . To assess the diffusion of both protein scaffold and RNA guest molecules inside condensates , we applied our pipeline to the corresponding SMT datasets ( Fig . 2b - c , Fig . 1h # 1 - 2 ) . Previous studies have observed multiple normal diffusion states of protein scaffold molecules within membrane - wetted domains or non - tethered 3D condensates with a D app ranging from ~ 0 . 01 to ~ 0 . 52 ¬µ m 2 / s 27 , 30 - 32 . Similarly , we found multiple diffusive states of FUS within the normal diffusion fraction , with a dominant peak at 0 . 81 ¬µ m 2 / s ( Fig . 2c , Table S1 ) . Remarkably , we additionally found that both intra - condensate FUS and mRNA molecules were significantly confined , with confined fractions of 67 ¬± 1 % and 83 ¬± 2 % , respectively , considerably higher than that of the outside dilute phase mRNA control ( 40 ¬± 2 % ; Fig . 2b ) . Confined diffusion was further supported by an a component distribution biased toward 0 and an angle distribution skewing toward 180¬∞ ( Fig . 2c , Table S1 ) . The D app distributions of unconfined FUS and mRNA molecules were partially overlapping , suggesting the formation of RNP complexes , whereas a fast - diffusing peak was found only in the FUS distribution , consistent with the relatively small molecular weight of the free protein ( Fig . 2c ) . The diffusion of unconfined mRNA molecules within condensates was slower than that of mRNA outside of condensates , which suggests an elevated viscosity in the condensed phase but cannot explain the confined diffusion . Collectively , these findings revealed that both FUS scaffold and mRNA guest molecules are significantly confined within a condensate , with mRNA more confined than FUS , while the normal diffusion fraction contains multiple diffusive states , some of which may represent RNP complexes . To probe the spatial relationship between the confinement of scaffold and guest molecules , we next sought to visualize the sub - condensate architectures that dampen diffusion . To this end , we performed point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topology ( PAINT ) 6 reconstruction from SMT trajectories , termed SMT - PAINT ( Fig . 2d ) , using dual - color SMT under alternating laser excitation ( ALEX ) to avoid bleed - through artifacts ( Fig . 1h # 3 ) . In a SMT - PAINT image , unconfined and fast - moving molecules leave fewer point locations and thus less pixel intensity than confined molecules because they quickly exit the imaging plane due to axial diffusion under HILO microscopy . Only confined molecules will significantly increase local point density and result in bright puncta in an SMT - PAINT image . We also ensured sufficient coverage of locations within a condensate by introducing an oxygen scavenging system ( OSS ) that extended SMT video length from the previous ~ 200 frames ( 4 s ) to ~ 10 , 000 frames ( 200 s ) ( Fig . 2d , Fig . S7 ) . The concentration - dependent increase observed in the number of trackable particles supports that the trajectories used for SMT - PAINT arose from the titrated molecules of 7 interest ( Fig . S7 ) . Using SMT - PAINT , we found distinct nanometer - scale regions that confine FUS and mRNA , which we term nanodomains ( Fig . 2e ) . The negative mean pixel - wise Pearson correlation coefficient ( PCC ) between the two nanodomains was - 0 . 26 ¬± 0 . 02 , suggesting a slight exclusion effect ( Fig . 2f ) . To further assess how non - confined molecules distribute throughout a condensate , we used step size heatmaps to measure the spatial distribution of fast - diffusing molecules ( Fig . 2g ) . We found that fast - diffusing FUS and mRNA molecules were spatially correlated with a positive mean PCC of 0 . 42 ¬± 0 . 02 ( Fig . 2h ) , suggesting co - diffusion of FUS and mRNA that was further supported by cross - pair correlation function ( G cross ) ( Fig . S8 ) . Taken together , these results yield intra - condensate diffusion patterns where distinct nanodomains confine protein scaffold and RNA guest molecules , while fast - diffusing molecules generally colocalize outside of these nanodomains .

Functional impact of nanodomains on FUS and RNA To gain deeper insight into the impact of nanodomains on the internal environment within a condensate , we first characterized the mobility of FUS nanodomains by time - lapse SMT - PAINT , where subsets of SMT trajectories within non - overlapping time windows were reconstructed into frames of a video ( Fig . 2d , Fig , 3a ) . The motion of FUS nanodomains was determined to be slower than 10 nm / s based on the mean step size of nanodomains in these time - lapse videos , which was smaller than our localization errors ( Fig . S4 ) . Therefore , FUS nanodomains as a whole are immobile at the minute timescale relative to the condensate . To explore the influence of nanodomains on the local chemical environment within a condensate , we performed fluorescence lifetime imaging ( FLIM ) on 10 nM AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS within tethered condensates ( Fig . 3b ) , where changes in fluorescence lifetime reflect an altered chemical environment 62 around the AlexaFluo488 dye . FLIM images showed nanometer - scale regions of low and high lifetime inside a condensate , with a minimum of ~ 3 . 2 ns and a maximum of ~ 3 . 5 ns , and a much higher lifetime of ~ 5 . 7 ns in the dilute phase ( Fig . 3b ) . Since our FLIM images were averaged from 10 scans spanning across ~ 5 min , any difference in lifetime associated with fast moving intra - condensate regions would have blurred out due to averaging . Therefore , we reasoned that the ~ 0 . 3 ns dispersion of lifetimes within a condensate is caused by a relatively immobile intra - condensate architecture , in particular the extremely slow - moving nanodomains ( Fig . 3a ) . To further test this hypothesis , we performed a fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) analysis at ten random locations within each tethered condensate on the same time - resolved confocal microscope used for FLIM to simultaneously derive local D app values and fluorescence lifetime ( Fig . 3c ) . The ten random locations are expected to sample both nanodomains and the spaces around them for us to relate local fluorescence lifetime and nanodomain - induced changes in D app , although FCS cannot distinguish slow from confined 9 diffusion . Indeed , we observed a positive correlation between lifetime and D app ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting that the ~ 0 . 3 ns decrease of lifetime in FLIM images was caused by FUS nanodomains of low D app . Finally , we tested another previously used method to probe the intra - condensate chemical environment ‚Äì imaging with Nile Red 26 , 28 . Although we found bright Nile Red puncta near the condensate surface , control experiments found such puncta also in the absence of condensates , indicating that they were caused by aggregation at the previously used dye concentrations , rather than an altered chemical environment ( Fig . S9 ) . Taken together , FUS nanodomains represent a slow - moving sub - condensate architecture that provides a distinct local chemical environment .

Since the 50 pM mRNA guest concentration was negligible relative to the 10 ¬µ M total concentration for FUS scaffold , we reasoned that nanodomains confining mRNAs are specialized FUS nanodomains that confine mRNA molecules , and asked how different the two types of nanodomains are in size , confinement strength , and relative location within the condensate . For brevity and clarity , we will use the following abbreviations throughout the remainder of this article : FUS nanodomains for nanodomains that predominantly confine FUS molecules , and RNA nanodomains for nanodomains that confine FUS less but more strongly RNA molecules . First , we calculated the auto - pair correlation function ( G auto ) of all locations from FUS or mRNA SMT trajectories to determine the size and ability to retain molecules of FUS nanodomains and mRNA nanodomains , as the radius ( R ) and amplitude ( A ) of G auto , respectively ( Fig . 3d ) . The radius of FUS nanodomains was determined to be 190 ¬± 30 nm while mRNA nanodomains are 130 ¬± 10 nm ( Fig . 3d ) . FUS molecules were 58 ¬± 6 % more likely to be confined in FUS nanodomains compared to randomly distributed within a condensate , while mRNA molecules were 90 ¬± 10 % more likely to be confined in mRNA nanodomains ( Fig . 3d ) . In line with the modest probability increase in FUS compared to mRNA nanodomains , fast - moving FUS molecules also transitioned through the FUS nanodomains , whereas fast - moving mRNA molecules were mostly excluded from the RNA nanodomains ( Fig . S10 ) . That is , FUS nanodomains have a weaker ability to retain molecules and are of bigger size than mRNA 11 nanodomains . Second , we calculated the normalized location distribution of both nanodomains relative to the condensate center and found distinct distribution patterns ( Fig . 3e ) . FUS nanodomains predominantly localize to the peripheral region of a condensate , evidenced by a 15 ¬± 3 % increase in probability compared to a random distribution , with a more minor preference for the center of a condensate , observed as an 8 ¬± 7 % increase ( Fig . 3e ) . In contrast , mRNA nanodomains predominantly locate to the condensate center ( 15 ¬± 7 % increase in probability ) , and less locate to the periphery ( 7 ¬± 3 % increase ; Fig . 3e ) . Remarkably , the peripheral localization of FUS nanodomains , observed here right after condensate assembly , coincides with surface - originating fibril out - growth after 24 hours , a phenomenon associated with condensate aging 39 , 63 ( Fig . 3f ) . These findings suggest that FUS nanodomains may facilitate the recently reported surface - induced liquid - to - solid transition of FUS 28 , 63 , 64 . In summary , FUS nanodomains are distinct from mRNA nanodomains in size , confinement strength , and location within a condensate , which may contribute a distinct chemical environment that primes the fibrilization of FUS from the surface of a condensate . Given that the mRNA nanodomain is a specialized but distinct version of a FUS nanodomain , we hypothesized that it may play a role in regulating RNA residence time in a condensate by trapping . Indeed , the escape path of an mRNA molecule from the inside to the outside of a condensate was significantly prolonged by the presence of mRNA nanodomains ( Fig . 3g - i ) . As shown in a representative trajectory ( Fig . 3g - h ) , an mRNA molecule was initially confined within a nanodomain from 0 to 0 . 92 s . Following escape from the first nanodomain , it became trapped in a second nanodomain until 1 . 86 s . After a second escape , the mRNA molecule diffused freely and reached the condensate boundary at 2 . 74 s , at which point it disappeared from the focal plane due to rapid axial diffusion in the dilute phase . To confirm that the extended escape time was due to confinement within two mRNA nanodomains rather than dampened diffusion by an increased local viscosity , we implemented a running - window analysis of D app and the ùõºùõº component of the trajectory and found clear transitions between normal and confined diffusion states ( Fig . 3i ) . In contrast to the potential role of FUS nanodomains in condensate aging , nanodomain - induced confined diffusion of mRNA molecules was only marginally promoted by aging ( Fig . S11 ) . To test whether an excess of RNA can rescue mRNA molecules from nanodomains via competitive binding , we added 50 ng / ¬µ L Hela cell total RNA during the reconstitution of condensates and profiled the diffusion of mRNA molecules within condensates ( Fig . S12 ) . We found only a marginal change in the fraction of confined diffusion mRNA molecules but the disappearance of a slower diffusive state in the normal diffusion fraction ( Fig . S12 ) . This suggested that the addition of total RNA indeed rescues some mRNA molecules from protein binding , but it only affects freely diffusive mRNA molecules with no impact on nanodomain - induced confinement . In summary , mRNA nanodomains mainly function as traps that increase mRNA residence time in condensates , independent of condensate aging or the presence of an excess amount of RNA background . Size , shape , and charge determine intra - condensate diffusion We next asked how the properties of a biomolecule , such as size , shape and charge , affect their intra - condensate diffusion profile . Specifically , we probed why mRNA as a highly negatively charged , high - molecular - weight molecule was more confined in nanodomains than FUS , a mixed - charge , comparably lower molecular weight molecule ( Fig . 3d , Fig . 1b ) . Previous studies have reported a preference for some RNP granules to recruit longer RNAs 65 - 67 . Based on this knowledge , we first examined whether the confinement of RNA molecules in nanodomains is affected by length , by comparing the 1500 - nt long FL mRNA with a 22 - nt short microRNA ( miRNA ; here miRNA21 ) by using dual - color tracking ( Fig . 4a - c , using Fig . 1h # 3 ) . 12 SMT - PAINT images showed that miRNA molecules had a more diffusive distribution ( Fig . 4a ) than mRNA ( Fig . 2e ) . Analysis with G auto further revealed that miRNA molecules were only 30 ¬± 3 % more likely to be confined in condensate nanodomains than expected for a random distribution ( Fig . 4b , Fig . S13 ) , significantly lower than the 90 ¬± 10 % increase in probability for mRNA ( Fig . 3d ) . Moreover , the 220 ¬± 30 nm radius of miRNA nanodomain uncovered by G auto ( Fig . 4b , Fig . S13 ) far exceeded the 130 ¬± 10 nm radius of mRNA nanodomain ( Fig . 3d ) . The nearly - zero mean PCC of - 0 . 05 ¬± 0 . 02 in FUS - miRNA SMT - PAINT images further revealed a weaker exclusion effect between FUS and RNA nanodomains than those of FUS and mRNA ( Fig . 4c ) . These modestly confining , large miRNA nanodomains explain the more diffusive pattern of miRNA in SMT - PAINT images ( Fig . 4a ) . Notably , a consistent intra - condensate diffusion pattern was observed , namely a strong co - localizing effect on fast - diffusing protein and RNA molecules , with weak exclusion of confined protein and RNA molecules ( Fig . 4c , Fig . S8 ) . Given the weak nature of these miRNA nanodomains , we next tested whether the single Cy5 dye on the miRNA itself exerts an influence on diffusion , by testing the free dye ( Fig . 4d - e , using Fig . 1h # 1 ) . Unlike the expected slower normal diffusion when decreasing the molecular weight from RNA to free dye ( Fig . 4e D app spectrum ) , Cy5 is more confined than miRNA molecules , with a 53 ¬± 1 % confined fraction that is slightly larger than the 46 ¬± 2 % of the miRNA ( Fig . 4d ) . This conclusion is also supported by the a and angle distributions ( Fig . 4e , Table S1 ) . These observations indicate that the confinement of the Cy5 - labeled miRNA was likely the base line of confinement observable within a condensate , possibly due to non - specific dye - protein interactions 68 . To conclude , only long RNAs like mRNAs , but not short RNAs like miRNAs , are significantly confined within nanodomains . We further investigated how other physicochemical properties of mRNA , such as overall size , shape and strong negative charge of the ribose - phosphate backbone , contribute to intra - condensate diffusion . To this end , we compared the intra - condensate diffusion profiles of FL mRNA molecules and carboxylate - modified 20 - nm beads , which mimic the charge and ~ 20 nm gyration radius of a typical 1 , 500 - nt mRNA 61 ( Fig . 4f - g ) . Compared to the linear - polymer mRNA molecules , the spherical beads have a higher immobile fraction in condensates ( Fig . 4f ) . This finding aligns with the fact that elongated , but not globular - shaped , objects can thread through a meshwork - like environment 69 , as found in a condensed , percolated droplet . Such a threading ability of linear mRNA may also explain the slightly faster diffusion among the normal diffusion mRNA fraction compared to the spherical beads ( Fig . 4g ) . To additionally probe the effects of surface charge , we performed SPT on a series of 9 . 5 - nm quantum dots ( QD ) with negative - charge carboxylate , charge - neutral PEG , and positive - charge amine coated surfaces ( Fig . 4h - i ) . Notably , all aspects of the diffusion profile remain the same between negatively and positively charged QDs , including fractions of diffusion type ( Fig . 4h ) and the distributions of a component , angle , and D app ( Fig . 4i ) . The only difference among QDs was that the neutral QDs had a larger immobile fraction than either of the charged QDs ( Fig . 4h ) . Taken together , unlike the length of an RNA , which determines confinement in nanodomains , both the linear - polymer nature and negative charge of an mRNA primarily contribute to maintaining its mobility in condensates but do not govern its confinement . 13 Fig . 4 ‚îÇ Effect of size , shape , and charge on the intra - condensate diffusion profile . a | Dual - color SMT - PAINT of FUS and micro - RNA ( miRNA ) with a cross - sectioning profile across the white dotted line .

Discussion Intra - condensate heterogeneity caused by a multiphase architecture , such as observed in the nucleolus , has long been characterized 56 , 70 , but intra - condensate heterogeneity independent of a secondary phase transition was only recently reported 26 , 28 , 63 , 71 . Percolation , a connectivity transition to form a network of physical bonds 7 , has been found to play a role in the pre - condensation assembly of protein clusters below the saturation concentration 72 , and of protein - RNA condensates after assembly 73 , 74 . However , it has remained unclear whether percolation has to be global , spanning throughout the condensate , or can be local . Our work addresses this question by characterizing nanodomains , which exemplify a local , rather than global , percolation emerging in liquid condensates assembled from full - length , tag - free FUS . Nanodomains revealed by SMT - PAINT confine either FUS scaffold molecules or RNA guest molecules ( Fig . 2 ) . Yet , they do not increase molecular density since they do not appear in bulk fluorescence images ( Fig . 1i , j ) , where a secondary phase separation would lead to changes in local concentration detectable in the fluorescence signal . Given that 99 . 9995 % of molecules in our condensate represent FUS , a model emerges in which the nanodomains confining FUS and those confining RNA are both formed by local percolation of FUS , but at distinct levels of local connectivity , possibly due to different FUS conformations ( Fig . 5 ) . In FUS nanodomains , the higher connectivity of FUS is sufficient to confine the protein but prevents the larger RNA molecules from entering due to the small pore size of the meshwork . In RNA nanodomains , the comparatively modest connectivity among FUS molecules permits RNA molecules to enter and become confined . As large biopolymers , their high multivalency effectively integrates them into an otherwise dynamic FUS connectivity network . The intra - condensate space outside both types of nanodomains has the lowest connectivity among FUS and thus fast - diffusing FUS and RNA molecules co - localize there ( Fig . 5 ) . The discovery of nanodomains brings to light a previously unexplored dimension of control over the molecular residence time within condensates‚Äîby modulating confined diffusion ( Fig . 3g - i ) ‚Äîpresenting a stark departure from the regulation based on normal diffusion as traditionally proposed 27 , 29 - 32 . The quantity , size , and confinement strength of nanodomains can 15 all affect the escape path and timing of a molecule from a condensate . A molecule will take longer to escape a condensate in the presence of more , larger , and higher connectivity nanodomains ( Fig . 5 ) . Fig . 5 ‚îÇ Nanodomains govern diffusion within a biomolecular condensate and affect the fate of both protein scaffold and RNA guest molecules . Given that inter - chain interactions promote aggregation or fibrilization 75 , the high local connectivity within FUS nanodomains likely provides a chemical environment ( Fig . 3b - c ) that would be favorable to stacking between FUS molecules and to fibril growth . We observe nanodomains to form shortly after condensate assembly , often near the condensate periphery ( Fig . 3e ) , so that they could prime the fibrilization of FUS during later condensate aging , explaining the surface - originating FUS fibril out - growth characterized in both previous studies 28 , 63 , 64 and our work ( Fig . 3f ) . Therefore , nanodomain - driven , locally tuned , inter - molecular dynamics in condensates may have pathological consequences , complementing a recent report that intra - molecular structural dynamics in condensates remains as fast as in dilute solution 29 . In conclusion , this work represents a significant step forward in identifying the spatiotemporal organization of the internal space of a condensate by demonstrating how nanodomains govern the intra - condensate diffusion profile . The techniques employed here can readily be adapted for other RNP condensates to dissect how they regulate RNA fate . While future work is needed to fully understand the driving forces behind nanodomain formation and their implications for cellular processes , our findings lay the foundation to study sub - condensate regulation of molecular function , en route to a complete understanding of the biophysical basis of condensate function in physiology and disease . 16 Methods Purification and labeling of FUS and RNA Full - length tag - free human FUS was purified following a recently developed protocol 46 , 47 with a series of ion - exchange chromatography under denaturing condition ( Fig . S1 ) , followed by a slow two - step refolding into a storage buffer containing ùõΩùõΩ - cyclodextran ( BCD ) that prevents phase separation . FUS was over - expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) from pET - FUS plasmid , a generous gift from the Ishihama group . Culture was grown to OD600 = 1 . 0 at 37 ¬∞C and induced with 1 mM isopropyl Œ≤ - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . After 6 h of growth at 37 ¬∞C , cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended with buffer A , 10 % glycerol , 20 mM [ 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ] ( HEPES ) - NaOH pH 7 . 0 , 300mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , and 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore Sigma ) , and store for 30 minutes on ice . Cell lysate was sonicated on ice , and insoluble protein was collected by centrifugation . The pellet was solubilized in a buffer B , 6 M Urea , 10 % glycerol , 20 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , and 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore Sigma ) . After centrifugation , supernatant was filtered with 0 . 45 ùúáùúá m filter ( Fisher ) and loaded to HiTrap Q column ( Cytiva ) on an NGC Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography ( FPLC ) station ( Bio - Rad ) . The flow - through fraction was mixed with CM Sepharose FF resin ( GE HealthCare Lifesciences ) on a rotator at 4 ¬∞C over night and passed through an open column to remove resin . The flow - through fraction was loaded to HiTrap Capto S column ( Cytiva ) on NGC FPLC station . The flow - through fraction was loaded to HiTrap SP HP column ( Cytiva ) on NGC FPLC station , and bound proteins were fractionated with 0 to 500 mM linear gradient of NaCl in buffer C , 6 M Urea , 10 % glycerol , 20 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA . FUS fractions were examined on sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) to ensure purity . If purity was not desired , FUS fractions were pooled , diluted to reduce salt concentration , and re - ran the above protocol from CM Sepharose FF to HiTrap SP HP . Finally , FUS fractions with desired purity ( Fig . S1 ) were pooled , aliquoted to 0 . 5 mL , flash frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored in - 80 ¬∞C freezer until refolding . For the first step in two - step refolding , 0 . 5 mL denatured FUS was thawed and diluted with 2 mL refolding buffer , 900 mM arginine , 100 mM [ N - cyclohexyl - 2 - hydroxyl - 3 - aminopropanesulfonic acid ] ( CAPSO ) pH 9 . 5 , 0 . 3 mM reduced glutathione , 0 . 03 mM oxidized glutathione , and 1mM ZnCl 2 , and stored over night at room temperature . The second step of refolding was performed during two rounds of two - hours dialysis against buffer D , 10 % glycerol , 20 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 6 . 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 10mM BCD , with a SnakeSkin 10K MWCO dialysis tubing ( Fisher ) at room temperature . After concentrated with an Amicon 10K MWCO Ultra - 4 centrifugal filter unit ( Millipore Sigma ) , the protein concentration of the final product was measured on NanoDrop ( Thermo Fisher ) with an extinction coefficient of 70 , 140 M - 1 cm - 1 . The full - length tag - free FUS was aliquoted , flash frozen , and stored at - 80¬∞C . To generate AlexaFluo488 - labeled full - length tag - free FUS , a third round of dialysis was performed using a buffer D , pH adjusted to 7 . 5 , right after the first two round of dialysis . AFDye 488 NHS Ester ( Click Chemistry Tools ) was added to FUS at a dye : protein molar ratio of 20 : 1 and incubated in dark at room temperature for 30 minutes . Ten rounds of buffer exchange to buffer D were performed using the above filter unit to ensure a complete removal of free dyes . Absorbance spectrum measured on NanoDrop was used to determine the labeling ratio and calculate the effective concentration of AlexaFluo488 - labeled full - length tag - free FUS . AlexaFlour647 - labeled firefly luciferase ( FL ) mRNA was synthesized according to an established protocol 53 , 76 . A T7 promoter sequence ( 5‚Äô - TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG - 3‚Äô ) was incorporated at the 5‚Äô end of the FL open reading frame during PCR amplification from a pRL - 17 CMV vector ( Promega ) . A Kozak consensus sequence and a 50 - nucleotide upstream region was incorporated before the translation start site to ensure enough space for the assembly of translation initiation complex 77 . After in vitro transcription with home - made T7 RNA polymerase , the transcript was purified via denaturing PAGE containing 7 M urea . The isolated RNA underwent enzymatic capping ( NEB ) and polyadenylation ( Thermo Fisher ) , employing an initial incorporation of 2‚Äô - azido - 2‚Äô - dATP ( Jena Biosciences ) followed by rATP . Finally , a click - chemistry reaction with AF647 sDIBO alkyne ( Thermo Fisher ) was conducted , strategically labeling between the coding sequence and the non - modified poly ( A ) tail to produce functional , fluorophore - conjugated FL mRNA . Free dyes were removed by multiple rounds of washing of the ethanol - precipitated mRNA pellet , which was confirmed by denaturing PAGE ( Fig . S1 ) . FUS condensate assembly A 10x phase separation buffer containing 200 mM tris ( hydroxymethyl ) aminomethane ( Tris ) - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1000 mM NaCl , 20 mM DTT , and 10 mM MgCl 2 was prepared and filtered with a 0 . 22 ùúáùúá m syringe filter ( Millipore Sigma ) for all reconstitution experiments , which was adapted from prior phase separation studies of FUS . Condensates were reconstituted by thoroughly mixing the full - length tag - free FUS at a final concentration of 10 ¬µM , a physiological concentration of FUS in Hela cell nucleus 39 , with the phase separation buffer , an optional OSS , and any fluorescently labeled species based on experimental type # 1 - 3 ( Fig . 1h ) , as described below . Note that we keep the time between the assembly of condensates and imaging within 30 minutes , except for aging experiments ( Fig . 4s - t ) , to ensure that all experimental observations reported in this study are signatures of early - stage condensates representing the dynamically assembled RNP granules in cells . Most importantly , we added the stock solution of FUS as the last component so that phase separation was initiated only after all other components were thoroughly mixed , mimicking the assembly of condensates within intracellular milieu . A total volume of 30 ùúáùúá L was used for each experiment . For intra - condensate SMT or SPT with condensate boundary detection needed ( Fig . 1h , # 1 ) , 10 nM AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS and 50 pM of the fluorescent species for SMT or SPT , such as Cy5 free dye , Cy5 - labeled miRNA - 21 ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) , AlexaFlour647 - labeled FL mRNA , 20 - nm FluoSpheres Carboxylate - Modified Microspheres ( Thermo Fisher ) , 9 . 5 - nm CdSe / ZnS core - shell type QDs functionalized with carboxylic acid , PEG , or amine ( Millipore Sigma ) , were mixed with phase separation buffer and an OSS composed of 2 . 4 mM protocatechuic acid ( PCA ) , 24 nM protocatechuate - 3 , 4 - dioxygenase ( PCD ) , and 2 . 4 mM Trolox 78 before adding stock solution of FUS . Cy5 free dye was made by neutralizing the N - hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) group on Cy5 NHS - ester ( APExBIO ) in 10 mM Tris - NaCl , pH 8 . 5 in dark at room temperature overnight . For the tracking of Cy5 free dye , single - Cy5 - labeled miRNA - 21 , and the QDs , the PCA - PCD - Trolox OSS was omitted because these particles have low signal to noise ratio ( SNR ) due to fast - diffusion induced blurring , single - dye rather than multiple - dye labeling per molecule , and luminescence rather than fluorescence . For intra - condensate SMT of FUS , where condensate boundary detection was not needed because FUS single molecules in dilute phase cannot be tracked due to motion blurring by its fast diffusion ( Fig . 1h , # 2 ) , 50 pM of AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS were mixed with phase separation buffer without OSS before adding stock solution of non - labeled full - length tag - free FUS . OSS was again omitted because AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS molecules have low SNR due to fast - diffusion , which we found could be further hindered by autofluorescence of high concentrations of PCA and Trolox in the OSS . However , for all SMT - PAINT experiments , extended SMT measurements were needed for an adequate coverage of trajectories over the intra - condensate space ( Fig . 3f ) and thus we implemented a color - less coupled glucose oxidase and catalase ( GODCAT ) OSS 78 with 55 U / mL glucose oxidase , 40 mM glucose , and 290 U / mL catalase . This 18 approach enabled us to obtain 10 , 000 - frames long high - SNR SMT videos with much less autofluorescence than PCA and Trolox that fulfills SMT - PAINT reconstruction needs ( Fig . S7 ) . For intra - condensate SMT of FUS and RNA for dual - color SMT - PAINT reconstructions ( Fig . 1h , # 3 ) , 50 pM of AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS and Cy5 - labeled miRNA - 21 or AlexaFluo647 - labeled FL mRNA were mixed with phase separation buffer and GODCAT OSS before adding stock solution of non - labeled full - length tag - free FUS . For any experiments involved crowding or total RNA , Dextran T - 500 ( Millipore Sigma ) was used at a final concentration of 10 % ( w / v ) and Human HeLa Cell total RNA ( TakaraBio ) was used at a final concentration of 50 ng / ¬µ L . Besides super - resolution imaging experiments above , FUS condensates were also assembled for phase diagram ( Fig . S2 ) , rheology measurements with C - Trap ( Fig . 1c ) , z - stack imaging with an Alba5 time - resolved laser - scanning confocal microscope ( ISS , Inc ) ( Fig . 1k ) , and fibrilization imaging ( Fig . 4s ) with minor modifications as listed below . For phase diagram , a 10x phase separation buffer was made without NaCl and MgCl 2 so both salt concentrations and FUS concentrations could be dictated by the combinations of conditions on phase diagram . C - Trap ( LUMICKS ) is an optical tweezer combined with laser scanning confocal microscope and thus could use fluorescence imaging to precisely measure condensate size change during fusion ( Fig . 1c ) . For C - Trap experiments , a raised 200 nM concentration of AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS with the PCA - PCD - Trolox OSS described above were used to ensure adequate SNR of condensates during fast - scanning confocal imaging . For the z - stack imaging of condensates for the confirmation of 3D shape ( Fig . 1k ) , an excess amount of red dye , 40 nM Cy5 free dye that can partition to FUS condensates , rather than AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS was used to simultaneously show the 3D shape of condensate and the location of glass slide , utilizing the intrinsic red autofluorescence of glass . Finally , for fibrilization imaging ( Fig . 4s ) , FUS condensates were assembled without any OSS , crowding reagent , or fluorescent species to exclude the possibility that fibrilization is an artificial effect induced by any of them . Microrheology Condensate fusion events were measured on a u - Flux microfluidics chamber ( LUMICKS ) and thorough cleaning was needed before experiments . The u - Flux chamber was thoroughly flushed by Milli - Q water ( Millipore Sigma ) , 6 % hypo - chloride bleach solution , Milli - Q water again , and 0 . 5 M sodium thiosulfate to neutralize any remaining bleach . To prevent any unwanted protein - surface interactions , the u - Flux chamber was then sequentially flushed with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) Pluronic acid F - 127 ( Millipore Sigma ) . All flushes above were performed at 2 bars of pressure for at least 10 min under the control of the u - Flux microfluidics pumping system ( LUMICKS ) to ensure a thorough wash . The last flush before experiment was 1x phase separation buffer to match the solvent conditions of FUS condensates . Air bubbles in the chamber could perturb the lamina flow and thus it is critical to make sure the microfluidic chamber is free of bubbles before starting the experiment . If any bubble exists , 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol solution was used to wash off air bubbles by changing surface tension , and all previous washing steps should be performed again to prepare chamber for the following measurement . At least two channels within the u - Flux chamber were used for microrheology experiments , a condensate channel and a measurement channel . Condensates were assembled as described above and pumped into the condensate channel at a low pressure ( < 0 . 5 bar ) to prevent the fission or deformation of condensates by friction forces , which can affect rheology measurements . Condensate fusion events were measured in the second measurement channel flowing with saturated concentration of 400 nM FUS determined from the phase diagram ( Fig . S2 ) to avoid trapping additional free - floating condensates when moving the 19 probing trap . Condensates picked for microrheology measurement were all around 1 ùúáùúá m in diameter . The probing trap ( purple , Fig . 1c ) approached the measurement trap at a constant speed of 50 nm / s , which is slower than the condensate fusion time scale to provide adequate time for fusion . Force on the measurement trap ( orange , Fig . 1c ) was measured at 50 kHz while the confocal imaging was collected at 4 Hz , limited by the laser scanning speed and the size of a field of view ( FOV ) to cover the pair of condensates . Analysis of force traces and confocal imaging were performed with home - made python scripts and Pylake package ( LUMICKS ) . All home - made python scripts used in this section and below were all deposited at https : / / github . com / walterlab - um / intra _ condensate _ SPT . For confocal imaging data , condensate area was calculated by Otsu thresholding on fluorescence intensity , which has been proved to be the most accurate condensate boundary estimator among other computer vision methods for large condensates 58 . For force data , fusion events were identified by down sampling from 50 kHz to 5 Hz , calculating the gradient of force , and finding the largest peak in the gradient of force . For each fusion event , the original 50 kHz force data ( ùêπùêπ ) was fitted to a previously used model 39 , 54 : ùêπùêπ = ùê¥ùê¥ + ùêµùêµùëíùëí % & ' + ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ , where ùúèùúè is the characteristic fusion time and ùê¥ùê¥ , ùêµùêµ , ùê∂ùê∂ are constants . The exponential part is a theoretical formula for droplet fusion . Constant A describes background of force measurement while constant C describe the artificial force increase introduced by the interference between optical traps when probing trap approaches measurement trap at a constant speed . All fusion events were manually inspected before subjected to the above pipeline to exclude traces generated by non - fusing condensates or debris . SMT / SPT under HILO microscope Condensates assembled with fluorescent species as described above were tethered on a glass slide surface via a PEG - biotin : streptavidin : FUS - biotin tethering system we developed , where the surface passivation step has been published before 79 . Glass coverslips were thoroughly cleaned chemically via alkaline Piranha solution and physically with sonication . To achieve surface passivation via PEG functionalization , glass coverslips were then treated with 3 - aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( APTES , Millipore Sigma ) with a 100 : 1 molar ratio mixture of 30 mM mPEG - succinimidyl valerate ( SVA , Fisher ) and 0 . 3 mM biotin - PEG - SVA , ended with a disuccinimidyl tartrate ( DST , Thermo Fisher ) treatment to neutralize any excess amount of reactive amine sites provided by APTES . Prepared slides were stored in a nitrogen tower in dark for up to 4 weeks . Right before experiments , sample wells ( Fig . S14 ) were made from half - cut PCR tubes ( Sigma - Aldrich ) glued to the prepared slides with epoxy ( Ellsworth Adhesives ) , and the PEG - biotin : streptavidin : FUS - biotin tethering system was established by incubating 1 mg / mL streptavidin ( Thermo Fisher ) and then 1 ùúáùúá M biotinylated FUS in sample wells for 15 minutes each , with three rounds of washing with T50 buffer , 10 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mm EDTA , pH 8 . 0 , between each step to prevent interference by contamination ( Fig . 1h ) . Note that the mPEG - SVA : biotin - PEG - SVA ratio was optimized to 100 : 1 to provide adequate tethers to restrict condensate motion while not inducing wetting . Once FUS condensates were added to each sample well , 50 ùúáùúá L of mineral oil was added dropwise on top of the mixture to prevent evaporation during imaging . The whole sample well was spun down at 200 g for 3 min to deposit FUS condensates to the glass surface for imaging later . All SMT or SPT inside or outside of condensates were performed on an Nanoimager ( Oxford ) equipped with a 100x objective lens , a set of two emission filters ( first with dual bands , 20 498 - 524 nm and 550 - 620 nm , and second with single band 665 - 705 nm ) , a 640 long - pass dichroic mirror channel splitter ( the resulted two channels are referred to as green and red channel below ) , and a sCMOS camera . All videos have a pixel size of 117 nm . To reduce fluorescence background and increase SNR of single particles , highly inclined and laminated optical light - sheet ( HILO ) 55 microscopy was achieved by setting the excitation laser angle to 52¬∞ , where the total internal reflection ( TIR ) angle on our Nanoimager is around 53¬∞ . All imaging was performed at 24¬∞C . For intra - condensate SMT or SPT with condensate boundary detection needed ( Fig . 1h , # 1 ) , SMT / SPT was performed in the red channel with 20 ms exposure time at an acquisition frequency of 50 Hz for the first 200 frames , excited by ~ 30 mW of 640 nm laser , while condensate bulk fluorescence imaging was performed in the green channel at the same exposure and frequency for the last 10 frames , excited by ~ 2 mW of 473 nm laser . The exposure time was optimized to 20 ms since a longer exposure time will hinder the tracking of fast - diffusing species by increasing motion blurring effect while a shorter exposure time will diminish SNR of single particles . Since condensates were tethered , their boundaries could be determined from an average intensity projection of the last 10 frames . For intra - condensate SMT of FUS without condensate boundary detection needs ( Fig . 1h , # 2 ) , SMT of AlexaFluo488 - labeled FUS was performed in the green channel at the same 20 ms exposure time and 50 Hz frequency for 200 frames , excited by ~ 30 mW of 473 nm laser . For intra - condensate SMT of FUS and RNA for dual - color SMT - PAINT reconstructions ( Fig . 1h , # 3 ) , alternating - laser excitation ( ALEX ) of ~ 30 mW of 473 nm and 647 nm lasers were performed with 20 ms exposure time for each color , which translates to an effective acquisition frequency of 25 Hz for each color . Finally , for SMT of FL mRNA outside condensates , both sample preparation and imaging procedures were slightly adjusted . Since FUS condensates strongly recruit RNAs , most mRNA molecules were inside condensates because of the relatively large condensed - phase volume at total FUS concentration of 10 ùúáùúá M . To allow more mRNA molecules observed outside condensates , we reduced the condensed phase volume by decreasing FUS concentration to 1 ùúáùúá M and lifted our focal plane to well above condensates , ensuring all molecules captured were outside condensates . Phase diagram and fibrilization imaging Phase diagram samples were prepared at various FUS concentrations of 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 , and 5 . 0 ¬µM . At each concentration we systematically varied the sodium chloride or potassium chloride salt concentrations of 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 , and 1 . 0 M . For an accurate measurement for condensation near phase boundary of the phase diagram , an incubation time of one hour was used to give the protein - condensates adequate time to coarsen into a detectable size . Samples were imaged on an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a 100x oil - immersion objective with ~ 1 mW of 488 nm laser and an exposure time of 100 ms . Fibrilization imaging was performed in bright field at various time points of 0 , 8 , and 24 hours using the Nanoimager ( Oxford ) described above with a 100 ms exposure time . Diffusion profiling pipeline To pick up only single particle fluorescence signal while suppressing background , band - pass filtering on all SMT / SPT videos was achieved by applying a difference of Gaussian ( DoG ) filter with a lower sigma of 1 pixel and a higher sigma of 3 pixels , representing on - focus and slightly off - focus single molecules . Filtered videos were subjected to TrackMate 80 to detect spots and extract trajectories . Spot detection was performed with a Laplacian of Gaussian ( LoG ) detector , 21 where an estimated object diameter was set to 5 pixels ( 585 nm ) and a spot quality threshold set to 5 or determined by the peak of false - positive spots in the distribution of quality values ( Fig . S15 ) . Trajectories were extracted by classic particle - linking algorithm , Linear Assignment Problem ( LAP ) , with the following parameter settings : for intra - condensate tracking , linking maximum distance was set to 5 pixels ( 585 nm ) with no gaps allowed ; for dilute - phase tracking , linking maximum distance was set to 15 pixels ( 1 . 755 ùúáùúá m ) with no gaps allowed . Trajectories were exported as csv files and fed to home - made python scripts for diffusion profiling . Our diffusion profiling pipeline has two parts : discrete categorization and continuous spectrum ( Fig . 2a - f ) . The discrete categorization part classifies every trajectory as either immobile , confined , or normal diffusion by following steps . To determine whether the particle is immobile or not , mean step size of each trajectory was calculated and compared to a threshold of 30 nm based on the 16 nm static localization error calculated from static mRNA molecules attached to glass surface ( Fig . S4 ) . To determine whether a mobile particle is confined or not , anomalous diffusion component ùõºùõº was calculated by fitting the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) - lag time ( ùúèùúè ) curve on a log - log scale using the formula below . ùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëô ( ùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄ ) = ùõºùõº ùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëô ( ùúèùúè ) + ùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëô ( 2ùëõùëõùëÄùëÄ ) where ùëõùëõ is the dimension of tracking ( ùëõùëõ = 2 in our case ) and ùëÄùëÄ is the diffusion coefficient . Note that the optimal number of fitting points in an MSD - ùúèùúè fitting has been determined to be roughly half of the trajectory length 81 , and thus we performed the fitting with a MSD - ùúèùúè series with the biggest ùúèùúè is smaller than half trajectory length unless it‚Äôs shorter than 5 steps , where a minimal number of 4 MSD - ùúèùúè points were guaranteed for accurate fitting . Trajectories that did not fit well to the model , indicated by fitting R 2 < 0 . 7 , were removed from the pool when calculating diffusion type fractions . Trajectories with a < 0 . 7 were categorized as confined diffusion while a > 0 . 7 as normal diffusion . Notably , we found that trajectories with very small a were also having very small R2 and thus the removal of the bad - fitting trajectories also removed trajectories with extremely small a ( Fig . S16 ) . The continuous spectrum part generates distributions of mean step size , ùõºùõº , angle between steps , apparent diffusion coefficient ùëÄùëÄ # ( ( , and localization error . The mean step size was calculated for all trajectories . The ùõºùõº components were calculated as described above for only mobile trajectories . The angle between steps was defined as the angle between the previous and current step ranging from 0¬∞ , meaning no change in direction , to 180¬∞ , meaning a complete turn - back , regardless of left or right and was also calculated for all mobile trajectories . The ùëÄùëÄ # ( ( and localization error were calculated for non - confined trajectories by fitting MSD - ùúèùúè curve to the following formula , which is optimized for least - square fit of MSD 81 , 82 : ùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄ = 2ùëõùëõùëÄùëÄùúèùúè + 2ùúéùúé ) ‚àí 4ùëÄùëÄùê∑ùê∑ùúèùúè where ùúéùúé is the localization error and ùê∑ùê∑ is the motion blur coefficient ( ùê∑ùê∑ = 1 6‚ÅÑ for continuous imaging as in our case ) . A Bayesian statistics - based state array method ( saSPT 60 ) was used to obtain a ùëÄùëÄ # ( ( spectrum with higher resolution , which originates from the fact that saSPT interprets ùëÄùëÄ # ( ( and localization error from each single step rather than a whole trajectory as above . Most parameters in saSPT were set to default values except that the range of diffusion coefficient in state array specified in ‚Äúconstants . py‚Äù file was changed accordingly . SMT - PAINT and step size heatmap analysis 22 Point accumulation reconstruction was performed with home - made python scripts on 10 , 000 - frames long SMT videos collected from SMT - PAINT experiments ( Fig . 1h , # 2 - 3 ) as described above . To ensure that puncta in SMT - PAINT images reveal underlying intra - condensate architecture that confines diffusion , the oversampling from long trajectories needs to be suppressed , avoiding the formation of artificial puncta due to a single long trajectory . Therefore , when generating the pool of locations for the reconstruction , only 10 locations were randomly sampled from all locations for any trajectory longer than 10 steps while all locations from trajectories shorter than 10 steps were passed along . SMT - PAINT image of the whole FOV was rendered by binning the pool of locations back to a grid of 117 - nm pixels , the same as the input SMT - PAINT video . Similarly , step size heatmap image of the whole FOV was generated from the pool above , by calculating pixel - by - pixel the mean for all steps that have a center of step within the pixel . Drift correction was not needed given the short total length of imaging time ( 200 s ) . Not all condensates were subjected to downstream analysis because some condensates did not have enough trajectories to cover the whole condensate while others had a strip - like pattern due to ‚Äòlensing effect‚Äô , where the spherical shape of condensates works as a lens to skew illumination ( Fig . S17 ) . Therefore , qualified condensates were picked by a python script followed by manual inspection . The python script first generates contours for all condensates by applying a threshold of 10 locations per pixel to the whole - FOV SMT - PAINT image smoothed with a ùúéùúé = 1 Gaussian kernel . The whole - FOV SMT - PAINT image was split to individual - condensate SMT - PAINT images by filtering out condensates smaller than 200 pixel 2 and cropping out each remaining condensate with a surrounding box with a padding distance of 3 pixels . All individual - condensate SMT - PAINT images were manually inspected to leave out all condensates with unwanted strip - like pattern ( Fig . S17 ) SMT - PAINT and step size heatmap images of all qualified condensates were paired , such as SMT - PAINT images of FUS versus mRNA , step size heatmap of FUS versus mRNA , and SMT - PAINT versus step size heatmap images of FUS , and analyzed with weighted pixel - wise Pearson correlation coefficient ( PCC ) using the below formula : ùëÉùëÉùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ * " + , - & " . = ‚àë ùë§ùë§ + ( ùë•ùë• + ‚àí ùë•ùë•ÃÖ ) ( ùë¶ùë¶ + ‚àí ùë¶ùë¶J ) + K ( ‚àë ùë§ùë§ + ( ùë•ùë• + ‚àí ùë•ùë•ÃÖ ) ) + ) ( ‚àë ùë§ùë§ + ( ùë¶ùë¶ + ‚àí ùë¶ùë¶J ) ) + ) where ùë•ùë• + and ùë¶ùë¶ + are the value of ùëñùëñ - th pixel in the vectorized ( ùëãùëã , ùëåùëå ) image pair , ùë•ùë•ÃÖ and ùë¶ùë¶J are the mean of all pixels in the ùëãùëã or ùëåùëå image , and ùë§ùë§ + is the weight of ùëñùëñ - th pixel in the same vectorized image . ùëãùëã and ùëåùëå image in the ( ùëãùëã , ùëåùëå ) image pair can be either SMT - PAINT image , where pixel value is number of locations , or step size heatmap image , where pixel value is mean step size . Weight is set to be the square of number of locations per pixel , factoring in that pixel values coming from more trajectories are more reliable than those coming from less trajectories . Pair - correlation functions Spatial distribution of SMT trajectories within a condensate was analyzed by the auto - or cross - pair correlation function ùê∫ùê∫ # / & 0 ( ùëüùëü ) or ùê∫ùê∫ 12033 ( ùëüùëü ) ( a . k . a . radial distribution function ) of locations . Pair correlation function ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) describes the probability of finding a particle of interest at a distance ùëüùëü from a reference particle , where the reference particle and the particle of interest are of same type in ùê∫ùê∫ # / & 0 ( ùëüùëü ) but are of different type in ùê∫ùê∫ 12033 ( ùëüùëü ) . Pair correlation function can be calculated by 23 ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) = ùëÅùëÅ + $ & " 2 " 3 & ( ùëüùëü ) ùëÅùëÅ 2 " 4 ‚àô ùúåùúå + $ & " 2 " 3 & ‚àô 2ùúãùúãùëüùëü ‚àô ùëëùëëùëüùëü where function ùëÅùëÅ + $ & " 2 " 3 & ( ùëüùëü ) counts the number of particles of interest that are ùëüùëü to ùëüùëü + ùëëùëëùëüùëü away from reference particles in a condensate , ùëÅùëÅ 2 " 4 is the total number of reference particles in a condensate , ùúåùúå + $ & " 2 " 3 & is the density of particles of interest in a condensate , and 2ùúãùúãùëüùëü ‚àô ùëëùëëùëüùëü is the ring area that normalizes the excess number of particles counted by function ùëÅùëÅ + $ & " 2 " 3 & ( ùëüùëü ) as the ring area scales with ùëüùëü . In the python script , ùëÅùëÅ + $ & " 2 " 3 & ( ùëüùëü ) was calculated by iterating through all reference particles because the normalization factor needs to be adjusted when the reference particle was too close to the condensate boundary . In that case , the ring centered at the reference particle was partially outside the condensate , where no particles of interest can be found , and thus it would be wrong to assume an average number of counts of ùúåùúå + $ & " 2 " 3 & ‚àô 2ùúãùúãùëüùëü ‚àô ùëëùëëùëüùëü can be found in the ring . Therefore , for all reference particles closer to the condensate boundary than ùëüùëü + ùëëùëëùëüùëü , the ring area within condensate was calculated to substitute 2ùúãùúãùëüùëü ‚àô ùëëùëëùëüùëü in the above equation . For all ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) in this study , ùëëùëëùëüùëü was kept at 100 nm and ùëüùëü ranged from 0 to 1 ùúáùúá m , with a sliding - window of 20 nm between adjacent ùëüùëü . Every qualified condensate yielded a ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) and the ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) for all plots was a weighted average of all the individual - condensate ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) , with the weight being total number of particles within each condensate . Each individual - condensate ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) was then fitted to the exponential model below because exponential decay can depict the behavior of molecules in a phase - transition system 83 : ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) = 1 + ùê¥ùê¥ùëíùëí % 25 where ùê¥ùê¥ is the amplitude that describes how much more or less likely a particle could be found compared to a random distribution of particles , and ùê∑ùê∑ is the characteristic radius of the clustering of particles . A parametric bootstrapping , 5 , 000 rounds of re - sampling from the pool of individual - condensate ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) , was performed to estimate the ùê¥ùê¥ and ùê∑ùê∑ for each experiment and their confidence intervals . ùê¥ùê¥ and ùê∑ùê∑ in each bootstrapping round were also plotted as histograms . Spatial distributions of nanodomains Nanodomains locations were estimated by either puncta detected by a LoG spot detector on individual - condensate SMT - PAINT images or using the centroid of confined FUS or RNA trajectories within a condensate . The distance of all such locations within a condensate to the center of the condensate was normalized by the radius of the condensate , where the radius was calculated from the total area of the condensate assuming a circular shape . Similar to ùê∫ùê∫ ( ùëüùëü ) , the distribution of all such distances within a condensate was also biased by the ring area growing with ùëüùëü , and thus needed to be normalized by ring area using : ùëÉùëÉ $ 02 ! ( ùëüùëü ) = ùëÉùëÉ ( ùëüùëü ) ùúåùúå + $ & " 2 " 3 & ‚àô 2ùúãùúãùëüùëü ‚àô ùëëùëëùëüùëü where ùëÉùëÉ ( ùëüùëü ) and ùëÉùëÉ $ 02 ! ( ùëüùëü ) are the probability and the normalized probability of distances that are ùëüùëü to ùëüùëü + ùëëùëëùëüùëü away from the condensate center , ùúåùúå + $ & " 2 " 3 & is the density of particles of interest in the condensate , and 2ùúãùúãùëüùëü ‚àô ùëëùëëùëüùëü is the ring area . Every qualified condensate yielded a ùëÉùëÉ $ 02 ! ( ùëüùëü ) , and 5 , 000 rounds of non - parametric bootstrapping from the pool of individual - condensate ùëÉùëÉ $ 02 ! ( ùëüùëü ) were performed to estimate the mean of ùëÉùëÉ $ 02 ! ( ùëüùëü ) for every ùëüùëü . 24 Fluorescence lifetime imaging and correlation spectroscopy Fluorescence lifetime imaging ( FLIM ) imaging of tethered condensates was performed with an Alba5 time - resolved laser - scanning confocal microscope ( ISS , Inc ) with a pulsed supercontinuum broadband laser excitation source ( Fianium WhiteLase SC - 400 - 8 - PP ) , avalanche photodiode ( APD ) detectors , and a Beckr - Hickl SPC - 830 TCSPC module . Condensates tethered on the glass surface were first found under regular scanning confocal imaging mode . After an optimal field of view framing a single condensate was identified , ten rounds of FLIM scanning throughout the whole filed of view were performed to ensure adequate data points for the lifetime calculation via deconvolution and fitting to a reference instrument response function ( IRF ) using FLIMfit 84 . The number of FLIM scans on each condensate was carefully chosen to achieve a total imaging time of around five minutes , matching a time scale where nanodomains were relatively immobile as revealed by time - lapse SMT - PAINT . The coupled fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) with FLIM assay was performed with the same setup as above , but only ten locations within each condensate were chosen at random using Sobel sampling rather than scanning through the whole condensate as in FLIM imaging . One - minute - long time - resolved intensity traces for Alexa488 - labeled full - length tag - free FUS were acquired per location and analyzed both for diffusion coefficient using FCS as well as fluorescent lifetime . Lifetime fitting was done with a MATLAB package FluoFit 85 , while FCS curves were analyzed with a custom MATLAB implementation of a segmented autocorrelation algorithm 86 to reduce the effect of photobleaching or long - term diffusive effects such as rocking of the condensate droplet as a whole . Note that the one - minute - long FCS traces provide much more datapoints for FLIM fitting compared to each pixel in a FLIM image , resulting in a better fit and explaining the different ranges of lifetime in FLIM imaging versus FCS - FLIM assays .
