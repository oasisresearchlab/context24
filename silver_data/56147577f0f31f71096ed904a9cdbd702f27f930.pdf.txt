Recent reports demonstrate that vesicles can form de novo in a few milliseconds . Membrane dynamics at these scales are strongly inﬂuenced by hydrodynamic interactions . To study this prob - lem , we develop new diﬀuse interface models for the dynamics of inextensible vesicles in a viscous ﬂuid with stiﬀ , curvature - inducing molecules . The model couples the Navier - Stokes equations with membrane - induced bending forces that incorporate concentration - dependent bending stiﬀness coeﬃcients and sponta - neous curvatures , with equations for molecule transport and for a Lagrange mul - tiplier to enforce local inextensibility . Two forms of surface transport equations are considered : Fickian surface diﬀusion and Cahn - Hilliard surface dynamics , with the former being more appropriate for small molecules and the latter being better for large molecules . The system is solved using adaptive ﬁnite element methods in 3D axisymmetric geometries . The results demonstrate that hydro - dynamics can indeed enable the rapid formation of a small vesicle attached to the membrane by a narrow neck . When the Fickian model is used , this is a transient state with the steady state being a ﬂat membrane with a uniformly distributed molecule concentration due to diﬀusion . When the Cahn - Hilliard model is used , molecule concentration gradients are sustained , the neck stabi - lizes and the system evolves to a steady - state with a small , compact vesicle attached to the membrane . By varying the membrane coverage of molecules in the Cahn - Hilliard model , we ﬁnd that there is a critical ( smallest ) neck ra - dius and a critical ( fastest ) budding time . These critical points are associated with changes in the vesicle morphology from spherical to mushroom - like as the molecule coverage on the membrane is increased .

Introduction The biological membranes that surround cells and organelles often undergo shape changes as part of cellular processes . In one class of processes , which includes endocytosis , inter - organelle transport and virus entry [ 22 ] , a small membrane vesicle is formed from a larger membrane . In others , locally curved membranes enable other mechanical processes such as cytoskeletal protrusion [ 27 ] . These events are typically orchestrated by curvature - inducing molecules that dynamically attach to the membrane , such as clathrin and bar - domain proteins . Classical clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which occurs on a timescale of sec - onds , has been extensively studied , including contributions from mathematical models [ 4 , 23 , 26 ] . However , recent reports demonstrate that in some circum - stances vesicles can form de novo in a few milliseconds [ 39 ] . Examples include ultrafast endocytosis at the neurological synapse , in which rapid endocytosis is necessary to complement rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters [ 29 ] . Ultrafast vesicle formation raises a fundamental biophysical question : Mem - brane dynamics at these scales ( millisecond , nanometer ) are dominated by hy - drodynamic interactions , as the membrane pushes the intracellular and extra - cellular ﬂuids around to accommodate curvature . What limits do hydrodynamic interactions impose on the speed of endocytosis ? How do the resulting intra - cellular ﬂows aﬀect the arrival rate of soluble curvature - inducing molecules ? What are the intermediate dynamic shapes of the membrane and what spatial constraints do these shapes place on membrane - associated molecules , such as clathrin and receptor cargo ? To address these questions , we have developed computational ﬂuid dynamic models of a membrane interacting with intracellular and extracellular ﬂuids . There is considerable range in the size , intrinsic curvature and molecular ﬂexibil - ity of curvature - inducing molecules [ 30 , 34 ] . Moreover , the identity of molecular participants in ultrafast endocytosis remains unknown . Therefore , we consider an abstract curvature - inducing molecule ( henceforth CIM ) and explore the de - pendence of vesicle formation on its properties . For simulation results , we use parameter values in the range of known CIMs . Mathematical models have been developed , and numerical simulations have been performed , for vesicles with variable biophysical properties due to the pres - ence of multiple lipid components and embedded proteins using discrete and con - tinuum approaches . See , for example , the review by Elson et al . [ 14 ] . Here , we use a continuum phase ﬁeld approach and extend our previous work for locally inextensible , homogeneous closed vesicles [ 2 ] to locally inextensible , heteroge - neous membranes with CIMs . Although phase ﬁeld models for heterogeneous vesicles have been developed previously , e . g . , [ 38 , 24 , 17 , 12 , 42 , 16 , 15 , 18 ] , none 2 Figure 1 : Schematic of the processes involved in endocytosis . Curvature inducing molecules attach to the membrane and induce out - of - plane deformations . Once enough molecules cover the membrane a vesicle is formed that provides the vehicle to transport extracellular cargo into the cell . of these approaches considered the eﬀect of ﬂuid ﬂow ( and local inextensibil - ity ) . The eﬀect of ﬂow on the dynamics of locally inextensible , multicomponent vesicles was investigated using a combined boundary integral and surface phase ﬁeld approach in 2D [ 32 ] and in 3D axisymmetric geometries [ 31 ] . However to simulate endocytosis , which typically occurs on length scales of nanometers while the overall membrane may be millimeters in length , as in the experiments described above , only a part of membrane can be considered due to computa - tional cost . This geometry is straightforward to implement using the phase ﬁeld approach developed here . Further , the phase ﬁeld model can also be extended to incorporate additional physical processes such as adsorption and desorption of CIMs following [ 35 , 36 ] and is independent of dimension , which makes the extension to fully three dimensional geometries straightforward as well . The outline of the paper is as follows . In Sec . 2 the mathematical model is presented . In Sec . 3 the discretization of the equations and the numerical methods used to solve the discrete system are discussed . In Sec . 4 , simulations demonstrating the convergence of the algorithm are presented along with an investigation of the inﬂuence of hydrodynamics and the dynamics of CIMs on the results . Finally , in Sec . 5 conclusions are drawn and future directions are discussed . Several technical results are derived in the Appendices . 2 . Mathematical Model Consider a membrane that is partially covered with molecules that have a non - zero bending modulus . Let us denote the membrane with Γ and the covered part as Γ c ⊂ Γ . Furthermore we assume that the spontaneous curvature is zero for a clean membrane and is H 0 for a membrane molecule . Then the total bending energy is E = (cid:90) Γ c 1 2 b c ( H − H 0 ) 2 d A + (cid:90) Γ 1 2 b m H 2 d A , ( 1 ) where b c and b m are the bending moduli of the molecule and the clean mem - brane , respectively . 3 To keep track of Γ c it is convenient to introduce the non - dimensional molecule concentration c ( x ) . Let us assume c to be normalized such that c = 1 corre - sponds to complete coverage of the membrane . Therefore , c may either be a coarse grained quantity denoting the normalized number of membrane molecules per surface area . Alternatively , c might assume only discrete values : either 0 or 1 , indicating the presence or absence of a molecule at a certain location on the membrane . The latter use of c would be particularly appropriate for large membrane molecules such as clathrin , whose size prevents the reasonable use of a coarse - grained concentration . No matter which interpretation of c is used , the energy of a CIM - covered membrane can be written generally as E = (cid:90) Γ 1 2 b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 d A . ( 2 ) Note that this functional has also been used to model the energy of multicompo - nent vesicles , e . g . , [ 31 , 20 ] , where in that case c denotes the concentration of one of the lipid components of the membrane . Here , we assume for simplicity that b and H 0 are linear functions of c . Other choices are discussed in Appendix A . 1 . In Appendix A . 2 we derive a sharp interface model of an inextensible membrane with CIMs in viscous ﬂuids using energy variation . 2 . 1 . Diﬀuse interface model The diﬀuse interface method , also known as the phase ﬁeld method , introduces an auxiliary ﬁeld φ that distinguishes the membrane interior from the exterior . The membrane is modeled by a narrow , diﬀuse layer . An equation is posed for the phase ﬁeld function φ , which is nonlinearly coupled to the ﬂuid equations . Near the interface , φ can be approximated by φ ( t , x ) : = tanh (cid:18) − r ( t , x ) √ 2 (cid:15) (cid:19) ( 3 ) where (cid:15) characterizes the thickness of the diﬀuse interface and r ( t , x ) denotes the signed - distance function between x ∈ Ω and its nearest point on Γ ( t ) . Taking r to be negative inside the membrane , we label the inside with φ ≈ 1 and the outside with φ ≈ − 1 . The interface Γ ( t ) is implicitly deﬁned as the zero level set of φ . 2 . 1 . 1 . Diﬀuse interface energy A diﬀuse interface version of the standard Helfrich energy ( 1 ) of a clean membrane was proposed in [ 10 , 11 ] : E = (cid:90) Ω 1 2 3 4 √ 2 (cid:15)b m (cid:18) (cid:15) ∆ φ − 1 (cid:15) ( φ 2 − 1 ) ( φ + √ 2 (cid:15)H 0 ) (cid:19) 2 d x , ( 4 ) where Ω = Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ∪ Γ is the computational domain . The scaling factor 3 / 4 √ 2 (cid:15) is chosen to match the sharp interface energy in the thin interface limit [ 10 ] . 4 To approximate the energy of a partially - covered membrane embedded in two ﬂuids , we now assume that the bending stiﬀness and spontaneous curvature depend on c . We also account for inertial eﬀects by adding the kinetic energy . The total energy is E = (cid:90) Ω 1 2 3 4 √ 2 (cid:15)b ( c ) (cid:18) (cid:15) ∆ φ − 1 (cid:15) ( φ 2 − 1 ) ( φ + √ 2 (cid:15)H 0 ( c ) ) (cid:19) 2 + 1 2 ρ | u | 2 d x . ( 5 ) Next , we use an energy variational argument to derive a thermodynamically consistent system of evolution equations for the diﬀuse interface , the ﬂuid ﬂow and the CIMs . 2 . 1 . 2 . Evolution equations To simplify notation let us introduce the following abbreviations : ˜ b ( c ) = 3 4 √ 2 b ( c ) ( 6 ) f ( φ , c ) = (cid:15) ∆ φ − F ( φ , c ) ( 7 ) F ( φ , c ) = 1 (cid:15) ( φ 2 − 1 ) ( φ + √ 2 (cid:15)H 0 ( c ) ) ( 8 ) The time derivative of the energy 5 can be written as ∂ t E = (cid:90) Ω 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf (cid:18) (cid:15) ∆ ∂ t φ − dF dφ ∂ t φ − dF dc ∂ t c (cid:19) + 1 2 (cid:15) ˜ b (cid:48) ( c ) f 2 ∂ t c + ρ∂ t u · u d x ( 9 ) = (cid:90) Ω (cid:18) ∆ ( ˜ bf ) − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dφ (cid:19) ∂ t φ + (cid:18) 1 2 (cid:15) ˜ b (cid:48) ( c ) f 2 − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dc (cid:19) ∂ t c + ρ∂ t u · u d x ( 10 ) where we used integration by parts and dropped the boundary integrals . We assume balance laws for momentum and mass conservation , although with forces that need to be determined consistently with the second law of thermodynamics ( thermodynamic consistency ) . To ensure local inextensibility at the ﬂuid - ﬂuid interface we use the the approach presented in [ 2 ] . Accordingly the Navier - Stokes equations are enriched by an additional variable λ which acts as a Lagrange multiplier and can also be interpreted as a surface tension . The inextensibility constraint is then added as additional equation restricted to the interface . The resulting Navier - Stokes system reads : ρ ( ∂ t u + u · ∇ u ) − ∇ · ( ν D ) + ∇ p = ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | P λ ) + F , ( 11 ) ∇ · u = 0 , ( 12 ) ξ(cid:15) 2 ∇ · ( φ 2 ∇ λ ) + | ∇ φ | P : ∇ u = 0 , ( 13 ) where D = ∇ u + ∇ u T is the rate of strain tensor and P = I − n ⊗ n is the surface projection operator with n = ∇ φ / | ∇ φ | being the normal vector . The ﬁrst term on the left hand side of Eq . ( 13 ) provides a harmonic extension of the tension 5 λ oﬀ the interface , with ξ being a regularization parameter , see [ 2 ] . The force F is yet unspeciﬁed and will be determined below to ensure thermodynamic consistency . We assume that the CIM concentration satisﬁes an advection equation , which is reasonable due to the very small interfacial diﬀusion of large molecules such as clathrin ( see previous section ) . This assumption will be relaxed later to incorporate molecular diﬀusion of CIMs on the membrane . ∂ t c + u · ∇ c = 0 . in Ω ( 14 ) Finally , for the phase ﬁeld variable we assume convection together with a yet unspeciﬁed source term . ∂ t φ + u · ∇ φ = − γg , in Ω ( 15 ) where γ is a positive mobility constant . By plugging in the balance laws ( 11 ) , ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) into the energy time derivative we obtain ∂ t E = (cid:90) Ω (cid:18) ∆ ( ˜ bf ) − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dφ (cid:19) ( − u · ∇ φ − γg ) + u · (cid:18) 1 2 (cid:15) ˜ b (cid:48) ( c ) f 2 − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dc (cid:19) ∇ c ( 16 ) + u · ( − u · ∇ u + ∇ · ( ν D ) − ∇ p + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | P λ ) + F ) d x . Integration by parts gives ∂ t E = (cid:90) Ω (cid:18) ∆ ( ˜ bf ) − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dφ (cid:19) ( − u · ∇ φ − γg ) − u · (cid:18) 1 2 (cid:15) ˜ b (cid:48) ( c ) f 2 − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dc (cid:19) ∇ c ( 17 ) − ν 2 | D | 2 + p ∇ · u − | ∇ φ | P : ∇ u λ d x , and inserting ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) yields ∂ t E = (cid:90) Ω (cid:18) ∆ ( ˜ bf ) − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dφ (cid:19) ( − u · ∇ φ − γg ) − u · (cid:18) 1 2 (cid:15) ˜ b (cid:48) ( c ) f 2 − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dc (cid:19) ∇ c ( 18 ) − ν 2 | D | 2 − ξ(cid:15) 2 φ 2 | ∇ λ | 2 + u · F d x . By choosing g = ∆ ( ˜ bf ) − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dφ , ( 19 ) F = g ∇ φ + (cid:18) 1 2 (cid:15) ˜ b (cid:48) ( c ) f 2 − 1 (cid:15) ˜ bf dF dc (cid:19) ∇ c , ( 20 ) we obtain a non - increasing energy : ∂ t E = (cid:90) Ω − γg 2 − ν 2 | D | 2 − ξ(cid:15) 2 φ 2 | ∇ λ | 2 d x , ( 21 ) Hence , a thermodynamically consistent evolution of a partially - covered mem - brane is given by the coupled inextensible Navier - Stokes - Willmore problem in Eqs . ( 11 ) - ( 15 ) with g and F from ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , respectively . 6 2 . 2 . The molecule advection equation In the previous section we assumed a pure advection for the concentration of CIMs in Eq . ( 14 ) . We can extend this equation to consider a small amount of diﬀusion in the tangential direction to account for diﬀusional transport of CIMs along the interface : ∂ t c + u · ∇ c − D c ∆ Γ c = 0 ( 22 ) We note that using this simple form of Fickian interface diﬀusion no longer guarantees that the energy E is non - increasing . While a more complicated sur - face ﬂux could be chosen to ensure that E is non - increasing , we take the surface diﬀusivity D c to be small , which limits the eﬀects of diﬀusion . Alternatively , if the membrane solely contains areas of no coverage ( c = 0 ) and full coverage ( c = 1 ) , a Cahn - Hilliard equation can be used to maintain these distinct values with a sharp transition in between . This is particularly useful if large membrane molecules are considered ( see Sec . 2 ) . The surface Cahn - Hilliard equation reads ∂ t c + u · ∇ c = D c ∆ Γ µ ( 23 ) µ = − (cid:15) ∆ Γ c + (cid:15) − 1 ( 4 c 3 − 6 c 2 + 2 c ) ( 24 ) Note that if µ is constant , so that the CIM concentration is in local equilibrium , then this equation reduces to the advection equation . Typically , deviations from local equilibrium are small . Both the Fickian and Cahn - Hilliard forms of the CIM evolution equation enable the use of ﬁnite - element or central diﬀerence ap - proximations without additional numerical stabilization such as the streamline diﬀusion method or upwind discretizations . Straightforward discretizations of these equations may not conserve the mass of the molecules along the interface . Note , that the continuous advection equa - tion conserves mass along the interface if inextensibility is perfectly fulﬁlled , but this is not necessarily carried over to the discrete case , where inextensibility and incompressibility are subject to spatial discretization errors . To deal with the problem of interfacial mass conservation , we use the diﬀuse interface approach from [ 28 ] . In this approach , the equations are restricted to the interface by multiplying with an approximation to the interface delta function ( here : taken to be | ∇ φ | ) . The advection - diﬀusion equation ( 22 ) becomes ∂ t ( | ∇ φ | c ) + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | u c ) − D c ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ c ) = 0 ( 25 ) and the Cahn - Hilliard equation ( 23 ) - ( 24 ) becomes ∂ t ( | ∇ φ | c ) + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | u c ) − D c ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ µ ) = 0 ( 26 ) | ∇ φ | µ + (cid:15) ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ c ) − (cid:15) − 1 | ∇ φ | ( 4 c 3 − 6 c 2 + 2 c ) = 0 ( 27 ) If the diﬀusion constant D c is large enough , the diﬀuse interface approach [ 28 ] ensures that c is extended oﬀ Γ constant in normal direction . This property is very important , since the bending stiﬀness and spontaneous curvature strongly depend on c . Having variations in these quantities across the interface makes 7 no sense physically . However , for the very small D c that we consider here , it cannot be guaranteed that c is constant in normal direction . Therefore it is necessary to introduce additional normal diﬀusion that averages c across the diﬀuse interface and results in constant extensions of c oﬀ the interface , without aﬀecting the accuracy of the solution on the interface . This approach has also been used in [ 13 ] . The resulting equation reads ∂ t ( | ∇ φ | c ) + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | u c ) − D c ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ c ) − D n ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | n ⊗ n · ∇ c ) = 0 ( 28 ) where D n is the normal diﬀusion constant and should be chosen larger than D c . In practice we empirically determine D n by increasing its value until a constant extension of c across the interface is ensured . The equations ( 28 ) or ( 26 ) - ( 27 ) both guarantee exact conservation of molecule mass on the interface : ∂ t (cid:82) | ∇ φ | c d x = 0 , in contrast to the original equations . With appropriate discretization this property is also carried over to the fully discrete system . Matched asymptotic analysis shows convergence of Eq . ( 28 ) to the original equation ( 22 ) and convergence of Eqs . ( 26 ) - ( 27 ) to Eqs . ( 23 ) - ( 24 ) , see [ 28 ] . 2 . 3 . Improving the accuracy of the inextensibility constraint The strong tangential forces that arise from tangential gradients of the CIMs in F can lead to problems with satisfying the inextensibility condition in the discrete system . Hence , small stretching or compression of the membrane may occur and , if allowed to accumulate over time , these errors can strongly inﬂu - ence the simulation results . Therefore we use a relaxation mechanism to correct accumulated local errors in the inextensibility as proposed in [ 2 ] . Following this approach , we introduce an additional variable s ( x , t ) to measure the accumu - lated local stretching and then we modify the RHS of Eq . ( 13 ) as described below . Initially s ( x , t ) is set equal to 1 everywhere and for t > 0 , s ( x , t ) is evolved by an advection - diﬀusion equation on the interface : ∂ t s + u · ∇ s + s ∇ Γ · u − D s ∆ Γ s = 0 . ( 29 ) This equation ensures conservation of s along the interface and indeed s can be thought of as an interfacial species concentration . This implies that s > 1 in regions where the interface is compressed and s < 1 where the interface is stretched . Eq . ( 29 ) can be approximated using a diﬀuse interface formulation as done in the previous section for the CIMs : ∂ t ( | ∇ φ | s ) + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | u s ) − D s ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ s ) − D n ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | n ⊗ n · ∇ s ) = 0 . ( 30 ) The idea is now to not require that inextensibility holds ( ∇ Γ · u = 0 ) but instead ∇ Γ · u = ζ ( s − 1 ) / s on Γ . Hence a slightly stretched or compressed interface will be driven back to a relaxed state . In the diﬀuse interface context , the relaxation model is realized by adding the term ζ | ∇ φ | ( s − 1 ) / s to the RHS of Eq . ( 13 ) . 8 In our simulations we will consider a part of the membrane , which implies that the membrane cuts the domain boundary . Hence , the membrane area is allowed to change , due to ﬂow into the computational domain . In this case a special boundary is necessary . Conservation of s on the membrane requires that the change in membrane area is equal to the amount of membrane ﬂowing in from the boundaries . The membrane area can be expressed in terms of s by (cid:82) Ω | ∇ φ | s dx . Hence , ∂ t (cid:82) Ω | ∇ φ | s dx = (cid:82) ∂ Ω − m · Pu | ∇ φ | dS , where m is the outer normal to the computational domain and we have assumed that the membrane outside of the computational is unstretched ( s = 1 ) . To ensure conservation ( locally ) we use | ∇ φ | m · ( u s − D s ∇ s − D n n ⊗ n · ∇ s ) = | ∇ φ | m · Pu on ∂ Ω . ( 31 ) as boundary condition to Eq . ( 30 ) . 2 . 4 . Governing equations Let us now summarize the governing equations derived in the previous sec - tions . The diﬀuse interface model for a membrane partially covered by CIMs consists of the following coupled system : 1 . The inextensible , incompressible Navier - Stokes equations for the ﬂuid ve - locity ρ ( ∂ t u + u · ∇ u ) − ∇ · ( ν D ) + ∇ p = ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | P λ ) ( 32 ) + g ∇ φ + 3 4 √ 2 (cid:32) 1 2 (cid:15)b (cid:48) ( c ) f 2 − √ 2 (cid:15) 2 bf ( φ 2 − 1 ) (cid:15)H (cid:48) 0 ( c ) (cid:33) ∇ c ∇ · u = 0 ( 33 ) ξ(cid:15) 2 ∇ · ( φ 2 ∇ λ ) + | ∇ φ | P : ∇ u = ζ | ∇ φ | ( s − 1 ) / s ( 34 ) 2 . The evolution equation for the phase ﬁeld variable ∂ t φ + u · ∇ φ = − γg ( 35 ) g = 3 4 √ 2 (cid:16) ∆ ( bf ) − (cid:15) − 2 bf ( 3 φ 2 − 1 + 2 √ 2 φ(cid:15)H 0 ( c ) ) (cid:17) ( 36 ) f = (cid:15) ∆ φ − (cid:15) − 1 ( φ 2 − 1 ) ( φ + √ 2 (cid:15)H 0 ( c ) ) ( 37 ) 3 . The evolution equation for the stretching measure s on the diﬀuse interface ∂ t ( | ∇ φ | s ) + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | u s ) − D s ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ s ) − D n ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | n ⊗ n · ∇ s ) = 0 ( 38 ) 4 . The evolution equation for the molecule concentration c on the diﬀuse interface ∂ t ( | ∇ φ | c ) + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | u c ) − D c ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ c ) − D n ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | n ⊗ n · ∇ c ) = 0 ( 39 ) or if the Cahn - Hilliard equation is used , ∂ t ( | ∇ φ | c ) + ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | u c ) − D c ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ µ ) = 0 ( 40 ) | ∇ φ | µ + (cid:15) ∇ · ( | ∇ φ | ∇ c ) − (cid:15) − 1 | ∇ φ | ( 4 c 3 − 6 c 2 + 2 c ) = 0 ( 41 ) 9 3 . Numerical method To solve the system of equations numerically we split the time interval I = [ 0 , T ] into equidistant time instants 0 = t 0 < t 1 < . . . and deﬁne the time steps τ : = t n + 1 − t n ( adaptive time steps could also be used ) . We deﬁne the discrete time derivative ∂ t · n + 1 : = ( · n + 1 − · n ) / τ , where the upper index denotes the time step number . We will use the notation ( · ) n to denote that all time - dependent variables in the brackets are evaluated at time step n . To correct any accumulated errors in the inextensibility , we choose the relaxation speed ζ = 1 / τ in Eq . ( 34 ) as in [ 2 ] . The numerical approach for each subproblem is adapted from existing al - gorithms for the Navier - Stokes equations and the Helfrich model . We solve the overall system using an operator splitting approach , with the Navier - Stokes equations being implicitly coupled to the inextensibility constraint and the Will - more problem for the phase ﬁeld variable . The equations for the CIM concen - tration c and the stretching variable s are solved separately . At each time step we solve 1 .

This is in accordance with similar implicit coupling strategies for the Navier - Stokes ( and other ﬂuid ﬂow equations ) and Cahn - Hilliard equations , e . g . , [ 41 , 6 , 1 , 5 , 9 ] . We solve the 3D - axisymmetric form of the governing equations using the adaptive ﬁnite element toolbox AMDiS [ 37 ] for spatial discretizations . We use P 2 / P 1 Taylor - Hood elements for velocity and pressure , extended by a P 2 el - ement for λ . For φ , f , g , s and c , P 2 elements are also used . The resulting linear systems of equations are solved with UMFPACK [ 8 ] . The adaptive mesh reﬁnement and coarsening are determined by gradients in the phase ﬁeld func - tion , which ensures high numerical resolution near the diﬀuse interface when small values of the interface thickness (cid:15) are used ; coarse meshes are used away from interfacial regions . We ﬁnd this reﬁnement is also suﬃcient to accurately capture gradients in the velocity ﬁeld . 4 . Numerical results We use our diﬀuse interface model and numerical method for an initial exploration of ultrafast CIM - mediated endocytosis . We neglect several phe - nomena , such as the process by which CIM attach to the membrane . Here we are primarily interested in testing the eﬃcacy of the method and explor - ing characteristic features , such as timescales , and dependence on parame - ters such as the size of the CIM - covered patch . The bending stiﬀness and spontaneous curvature of clathrin were measured in [ 21 ] and estimated to be H 0 = ( 14 . 1 nm ) − 1 and b c = 12 b m , where b m = 1 × 10 − 19 kg m 2 / s 2 is the bend - ing stiﬀness of a typical uncovered membrane . According to these parameters we choose the concentration - dependent parameters H 0 ( c ) = c · ( 14 . 1 nm ) − 1 and b ( c ) = ( 1 + 11 c ) · 1 × 10 − 19 kg m 2 / s 2 . We assume that the initial membrane is nearly ﬂat , axisymmetric and cov - ered with a circular region of CIMs , as illustrated in Fig . 4 . We thus implement the equations using cylindrical coordinates with the computational domain being Ω = [ 0 , 80 ] × [ 0 , 160 ] nm 2 . The circular membrane has a radius of 80 nm . For the circular CIM region we use diﬀerent radii ranging from r = 20 nm to r = 60 nm . For the boundary 11 Figure 2 : The 3D axisymmetric conﬁguration . conditions we pin the membrane at the outer domain boundary by imposing the condition φ n = φ ( t = 0 ) in the equation for g . Furthermore we enforce a 90 degree angle between the membrane and the domain boundary : m · ∇ φ = 0 , where m is the normal on the domain boundary . For the velocity we apply a free stress condition almost everywhere . The only exception to this condition is made where the outer domain boundary meets the membrane . There , in a small neighborhood of the membrane we impose zero vertical velocity u · ( 0 , 1 ) T = 0 . This corresponds to the pinning of the membrane , since it prevents the membrane from moving vertically , while still allowing inﬂow of membrane area into the computational domain . For the pressure we impose p = 0 in one grid point , to regularize the Navier - Stokes system . The physical and numerical parameters are given in Tab . 1 . Here , we brieﬂy comment on the choice of some of the parameters . We choose a small mobility γ = 6 . 4 nm 3 / s such that the phase ﬁeld is predominantly advected by the ﬂow . The value of (cid:15) = 1 . 2 nm gives an interface thickness comparable to that of a real lipid interface . To improve eﬃciency , we use adaptive time stepping and adaptive spatial mesh reﬁnement . Initially , we use τ = 0 . 01ns and double this value every 30 time steps up to τ max = 2ns . An adaptive spatial grid is used to obtain high resolution near the membrane . The grid size h measures the diameter of the triangles used at the interface while the grid size away from the interface is 8 h . We take h = 1 . 25 nm , which ensures that approximately ﬁve vertices on the mesh can be found across the interface . 4 . 1 . Convergence of the numerical method We ﬁrst validate the numerical method by investigating convergence in the parameters (cid:15) , γ , h and τ . The strategy is to vary one of the parameters while keeping the others ﬁxed at the values given in Tab . 1 .

Also when the grid size is decreased a smaller time step size is used : τ = 0 . 1 ns . This was found to be necessary for solvability of the equations if the grid is reﬁned and also ensures that the error in time stepping is small . Simulations are conducted with the Cahn - Hilliard model for the molecule concentration equation . In all the simulations the membrane develops an out - of - plane deformation , forms a bud and ﬁnally evolves to stationary conﬁguration consisting of a vesicle connected to the membrane by a thin neck . Since the sta - tionary states for all parameters are quite similar , we measure the dependency of the parameters in the transient state at the early time t = 0 . 5 µs when the membrane starts to deform . The speed with which this occurs is highly depen - dent on the parameters . The out - of - plane deformation is accompanied with an increase of membrane area over time , which makes the membrane length in the computational domain to be an excellent error measure . Hence we deﬁne the measured error by | l − l ref | / l ref , where l and l ref are the membrane lengths ob - tained for a particular parameter value and for the ﬁnest value of the respective parameter . Tab . 2 shows the error for diﬀerent model parameters ( γ , (cid:15) ) and numerical parameters ( h , τ ) , respectively . The error in all of the parameters seems to converge to zero for decreasing parameter value . To better judge the signiﬁcance of the given error values we note that the average interface length at t = 0 . 5 µs is approximately l = 86 nm . The largest sources of error are seen to be the interface thickness and grid size parameters (cid:15) and h , whereas the errors in time step τ and mobility γ are comparatively small . 4 . 2 . Molecule diﬀusion vs . Cahn - Hilliard surface dynamics Next we investigate the diﬀerences between the two models of molecule trans - port . For classical surface Fickian diﬀusion we choose the diﬀusion constants D c = 16 nm 2 / µs and D n = 1600 nm 2 / µs in Eq . ( 39 ) . Having D n one hundred times larger than D c ensures that c is approximately constant in normal direc - tion away from the interface . The value of D c is chosen as small as possible , e . g . , a smaller value of D c would require additional advection stabilization . The Cahn - Hilliard model allows a larger diﬀusion since the Cahn - Hilliard equation maintains sharp gradients in the molecule concentration . Accordingly , we use D c = 64 × 10 + 3 nm 3 / µs in Eq . ( 40 ) 14 0 µs 2 . 0 µs 10 . 0 µs 36 . 0 µs Figure 3 : Comparison of membrane evolution and CIM concentrations c when the curvature - inducing molecules are transported by the surface Cahn - Hilliard model ( top ) or Fickian surface diﬀusion ( bottom ) . The Cahn - Hilliard model maintains sharp gradients of CIMs between the distinct values of 1 ( covered ) and 0 ( uncovered ) and produces a steady - state conﬁguration consisting of a compact vesicle connected to the membrane by a small neck . Fickian diﬀusion decreases the gradients of the CIMs that transiently produces longer necks and more deformed vesicles . Fig . 3 shows the time evolution of the membranes colored by the molecule concentration using the Cahn - Hilliard model ( top ) and the Fickian model ( bot - tom ) . Due to the presence of the CIM and its inﬂuence on the bending stiﬀness and preferred curvature , the membrane is initially very tense . To relieve this tension the membrane develops an out - of - plane deformation localized at the region covered with CIMs . The bud grows to form a vesicle , which remains connected to the rest of the membrane by a neck . When the Cahn - Hilliard model is used ( top ) , steep gradients in the CIM concentration are maintained in time . On the other hand , when the Fickian model is used ( bottom ) , the gradients in the CIM concentration decrease due to dissipation . Consequently , in the Cahn - Hilliard case , the dynamics are faster , the resulting neck is smaller and the vesicle is more compact compared to that obtained using Fickian model . In addition , the Cahn - Hilliard evolution leads to a non - trivial stationary state of the system . However , the membrane and CIM concentration continue to evolve in the Fickian model up to the ﬁnal time t = 36 . 0 µs . Moreover , in the Fickian case , the only steady state consists of a uniformly distributed CIM concentration on a ﬂat membrane . In the following we only focus on the Cahn - Hilliard equation for the CIMs since this model is appropriate for large , slowly diﬀusing molecules such as clathrin and yields non - trivial steady - states and distinct endocytosing vesicles . 4 . 3 . The inﬂuence of hydrodynamics At nanometer length scales the question arises whether hydrodynamics actu - ally has an eﬀect on the dynamics of the system . In principle one could also use 15 a pure geometric evolution of the membrane without considering the surround - ing ﬂuids . To the best of our knowledge there is no geometric diﬀuse interface evolution available that includes membrane inextensibility . Hence , we drop the inextensibility constraint and evolve the membrane using Willmore - ﬂow coupled to the diﬀuse interface Cahn - Hilliard equation for the molecule concentration ( 40 ) - ( 41 ) . This transports the molecules and ensures their conservation along the membrane even without ﬂow . Accordingly , we solve only Eqs . ( 35 ) - ( 37 ) and ( 40 ) - ( 41 ) with u = 0 . The parameters are as in the previous section except for the Willmore mobility , which is now the only driving force of the interface evolution . In this case , we set mobility γ = 4 . 2 nm 3 / µs so as to approximately synchronize the dynamics of the geometric and ﬂuid models . Fig . 4 shows a comparison of the interface evolution with ( bottom ) and without ( top ) ﬂow . The simulation without ﬂow shows a downwards movement of the membrane at early times since it costs no energy to push the ﬂuid down . If ﬂow is present this downwards movement is largely suppressed as an eﬀect of the ﬂuid incompressibility . After forming a neck the membrane quickly pinches oﬀ in the case of without ﬂow . When ﬂow is involved , this eﬀect is not seen and the membrane rather assumes a stationary state with a stable neck . We assume inextensibility to be the main reason for this . In order for the neck radius to decrease , ﬂuid needs to be drained out of the near contact region . Once the neck is suﬃciently narrow , additional drainage would require tangential ﬂow along the membrane due to viscosity . However this would stretch the membrane . As a result , membrane inextensibility inhibits ﬂuid drainage in the near contact region , as can clearly be seen from the velocity vectors shown in the ﬁgure . This stabilizes the neck . This result is also in agreement with simulations presented in [ 2 ] where it was shown that inextensibility can prevent the close approach of membranes . It is interesting that experimental results indicate that pinch - oﬀ can not be triggered by clathrin alone , but rather requires the action of another molecule called dynamin [ 7 ] . In principle our model can be extended to account for the presence of dynamin and as presented in [ 42 ] an adhesive potential can be used to model fusion and ﬁssion in diﬀuse interface models . This will be considered in future work . 4 . 4 . Varying the CIM region size Now we investigate what eﬀect the size of the covered region has on the dy - namics and stationary state of the membrane . The radius of the initially circular CIM region is varied from 20nm to 60nm . Fig . 5 shows the stationary shapes at t = 20 . 0 µs . We ﬁnd that for small amounts of CIM ( radius ≤ 20 nm ) the membrane deforms out - of - plane , but does not form a neck . For larger amounts ( radius 28 − 40 nm ) a neck forms and the endocytosing vesicle is small and nearly spherical . If the CIM region is increased further ( radius > 40 nm ) the vesicle assumes a mushroom - like shape . The lateral diameter and neck radius of the stationary vesicle are displayed as a function of CIM radius in Fig . 6 . Both quantities are measured at t = 20 µs when the membrane has reached an ( almost ) stationary shape . The vesicle 16 nm / µs Figure 4 : Comparison of the membrane evolution and CIM concentrations with ( bottom ) and without ﬂow ( top ) at times t = 2 . 90 µs , 7 . 46 µs , 14 . 02 µs , 16 . 98 µs from left to right . After forming a neck the membrane pinches oﬀ without ﬂow . This is not seen when ﬂow is involved and the neck radius stops decreasing at a certain point . The arrows indicate the velocity direction and magnitude on a logarithmic scale . 20nm 30nm 40nm 50nm Figure 5 : Stationary shapes of the membrane and CIM concentrations for diﬀerent sizes of the initial CIM region using the surface Cahn - Hilliard model . 17 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 20 30 40 50 60 radius of CIM region [ nm ] vesicle diameter at budding [ nm ] no neck spherical shape mushroom shape 2 2 , 2 2 , 4 2 , 6 2 , 8 3 3 , 2 3 , 4 3 , 6 20 30 40 50 60 radius of CIM region [ nm ] neck radius [ nm ] no neck spherical shape mushroom shape Figure 6 : Diameter of the vesicle and neck radius of the stationary membrane for diﬀerent sizes of the initial CIM region . 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 31 36 41 46 51 56 61 66 71 vesicle diameter [ nm ] time to bud [ µs ] spherical shape mushroom shape Figure 7 : Time required for a bud to form for diﬀerent initial radii of the CIM region . diameter is a linear function of the initial CIM radius as one might expect . For the neck radius we ﬁnd a critical CIM radius r = 40 nm which gives the most narrow neck . This value is right at the transition from spherical to mushroom - like vesicles . The mushroom - like shape of the vesicle more strongly inhibits ﬂuid drainage from the neck region because more regions of the membrane are brought in close approach near the neck . As described above , this inhibits tangential ﬂuid ﬂow both in the neck and in nearby regions because of membrane inextensibility . To quantify the inﬂuence of the CIM region size on the dynamics we measure the time until budding occurs . We deﬁne this to be the time at which the neck radius falls below 5 nm . The results indicate a critical vesicle diameter of approximately d = 42 nm at which budding occurs fastest . This corresponds to the initial radius of the CIM region of 36 nm . Interestingly , these results are consistent with the sizes of vesicles produced by ultrafast endocytosis in [ 39 ] where synaptic vesicles were observed to have diameters 41 . 1 ± 0 . 1 nm . 18 5 . Conclusions Using an energy variation methodology , we have developed new diﬀuse inter - face models for the dynamics of inextensible vesicles in a viscous ﬂuid with stiﬀ , curvature - inducing molecules that inﬂuence the bending stiﬀness and sponta - neous curvature of the membrane . The model couples the Navier - Stokes equa - tions with membrane - induced bending forces with equations for molecule trans - port and for a Lagrange multiplier to enforce local inextensibility . Following [ 2 ] , the Lagrange multiplier is harmonically extended oﬀ the interface and a re - laxation scheme is used that dynamically corrects local stretching / compression errors thereby preventing their accumulation . This is critical to accurately cap - turing hydrodynamic eﬀects during endocytosis . Two forms of surface transport equations were considered : Fickian surface diﬀusion and Cahn - Hilliard surface dynamics . The surface equations were re - formulated using the diﬀuse interface method where diﬀusion in the normal direction is added to ensure that the CIM concentration is extended oﬀ the in - terface constant in the normal direction , which improves accuracy and stability of the method . Using an adaptive ﬁnite element method , the system was solved in 3D ax - isymmetric geometries with boundary conditions that enabled the transport of membrane into and out of the computational domain . The membrane in the computational domain is thus interpreted as only a part of the cell membrane , which is much larger ( e . g . , micron scale ) . The results showed that hydrodynamics can indeed enable the rapid for - mation of a small vesicle attached to the membrane by a narrow neck . When the Fickian model is used , this is a transient state with the steady state being a ﬂat membrane with a uniformly distributed molecule concentration due to diﬀusion . When the Cahn - Hilliard model is used , molecule concentration gradi - ents are sustained , the neck stabilizes due to membrane inextensibility and the system evolved to a steady - state with a small , compact vesicle attached to the membrane . The steady - state vesicle morphology in the Cahn - Hilliard model was found to depend on the initial coverage of CIMs on the membrane . When the coverage is too small , no neck formed . In an intermediate range of CIM coverages , the vesicle acquired a spherical shape . When the CIM coverage was large , the vesicle attained a mushroom - like shape as regions of negative curvature developed . By varying the membrane coverage of molecules in the Cahn - Hilliard model , we found that there is a critical ( smallest ) neck radius and a critical ( fastest ) budding time . We found that the vesicle diameter corresponding to the fastest budding was consistent with the typical sizes of synaptic vesicles produced by ultrafast endocytosis in experiments [ 39 ] . An important , and potentially rate limiting step in CIM - orchestrated endo - cytosis and membrane ﬁssion is the transport of CIMs in the bulk ﬂuid to and from the membrane as well as the details of adsorption and desorption processes at the membrane . While we have not considered these eﬀects here , they can straightforwardly be incorporated in our formulation using the diﬀuse interface 19 methodology developed in [ 35 , 36 ] to couple bulk and surface transport . A sim - ilar methodology can also be used to investigate the inﬂuence of the budding dynamics , vesicle morphologies and corresponding ﬂuid ﬂows on the transport of soluble molecules and cargo from the exterior to the interior of a cell . An - other important feature that should be investigated is the excess energy , or line tension , that may be associated with a CIM / clean interface on the membrane . Further , since the spatial scales are small , thermal ﬂuctuations may also play a role in CIM transport and the membrane dynamics . Fully three dimensional geometries should also be considered as small non - axisymmetric perturbations could inﬂuence the results . These and other processes will be considered in future work .

Energy of a partially - covered membrane In [ 26 ] the energy of a membrane with CIMs was modeled using E = (cid:90) Γ 1 2 b c c ( H − H 0 ) 2 + 1 2 b m H 2 d A , ( A - 1 ) where c was interpreted as a coarse - grained concentration . This is questionable for large molecules such as clathrin since the size of a clathrin molecule can be about the same order of magnitude as the considered domain size . There is also another reason why the above energy ( A - 1 ) is not necessarily a good choice . The transformation of ( 1 ) to ( A - 1 ) uses the simple ansatz (cid:82) Γ c · d A = (cid:82) Γ c · d A , which is not appropriate if c is a coarse - grained concentration . In fact the whole energy ( A - 1 ) must be coarse - grained to account for diﬀerent bending of covered and non - covered parts of the membrane . Based on this principle we derive an alternative form , which is a the natural coarse - grained version of the energy ( 1 ) . Let us consider a small control area on the membrane A ⊂ Γ . Let us assume the area is small enough such that the curvature can be assumed constant along A ∩ Γ and A ∩ Γ c , respectively . Hence , H = (cid:26) H m in A ∩ ( Γ \ Γ c ) H c in A ∩ Γ c . 20 Figure A . 1 : Schematic of a partially covered membrane . While the observed membrane curvature is ˜ H , a close - up shows that the membrane is curved diﬀerently in covered and uncovered regions ( curvature H c and H m , resp . ) . The diﬀerent curvatures are related by Eq . ( A - 2 ) . Figure A . 1 illustrates this setting . Since the control volume is very small , these small scale diﬀerences in the curvature will not be seen by the observer . The observed curvature is also a coarse - grained version of H and can be written as a linear combination of H c and H m : ˜ H = H c | A ∩ Γ c | / | A | + H m | A ∩ ( Γ \ Γ c ) | / | A | . ( A - 2 ) Now , we can introduce the concentration c of the CIM species as c = | A ∩ Γ c | / | A | , which gives ˜ H = cH c + ( 1 − c ) H m . ( A - 3 ) Next , consider the energy of the control volume . From Eq . ( 1 ) we obtain E A = 1 2 b c ( H c − H 0 c ) 2 | A | c + 1 2 b m H 2 m | A | ( 1 − c ) + 1 2 b m H 2 c | A | c . ( A - 4 ) Assume that this energy is minimal , since A is small enough so that the system is in local equilibrium . Subject to Eq . ( A - 3 ) and keeping ˜ H ﬁxed , E A is minimized for H m = ( b c + b m ) ( b c + b m ) − c · b c (cid:18) ˜ H − H 0 b c b c + b m (cid:19) , H c = ( ˜ H − H m · ( 1 − c ) ) / c , ( A - 5 ) 21 Figure A . 2 : A comparison of linear and nonlinear constitutive laws for the bending stiﬀness ( left ) and spontaneous curvature ( right ) as labelled . which gives , E A = 1 2 ( b c + b m ) b m ( b c + b m ) − c · b c (cid:18) ˜ H − H 0 b c b c + b m c (cid:19) 2 | A | + P ( c ) | A | , ( A - 6 ) where P ( c ) is a rational function of c , independent of ˜ H . Since the above holds for arbitrary A we may conclude the energy of the whole membrane is E = (cid:90) Γ 1 2 ( b c + b m ) b m ( b c + b m ) − c · b c (cid:18) ˜ H − H 0 b c b c + b m c (cid:19) 2 + P ( c ) d A ( A - 7 ) In the case of an inextensible membrane ( ∇ Γ · u = 0 ) with purely advected CIM ( ∂ t c + u · ∇ c = 0 ) , the functional (cid:82) Γ P ( c ) d A will give a constant contribution to the energy , which allows one to drop this term in an energy variation argument . Hence , the spontaneous curvature of a partially - covered membrane depends lin - early on c , while the bending stiﬀness is not a simple linear function of c . This is in contrast to the energy given in ( A - 1 ) , which can be lumped to E = (cid:90) Γ 1 2 ( cb c + b m ) (cid:18) ˜ H − H 0 cb c cb c + b m (cid:19) 2 + P 2 ( c ) d A ( A - 8 ) A comparison of the linear and nonlinear bending stiﬀnesses and spontaneous curvatures is shown in Fig . A . 1 . Here , we do not explore these diﬀerences in constitutive laws for the bending stiﬀness and spontaneous curvatures . This will be investigated in a future work . A . 2 . Sharp interface model In this section , we derive a sharp interface model for the membrane - CIM system using an energy variation argument . Consider the general energy of a 22 partially - covered membrane together with the kinetic energy of the surrounding ﬂuids E = (cid:90) Γ b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 d A + (cid:90) Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ρ 2 | u | 2 d x . ( A - 9 ) We vary the energy in H and c simultaneously by taking the time derivative of E . Using the Leibnitz rule and n · ∇ c = 0 , we obtain : ∂ t E = (cid:90) Γ b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) ( ∂ t H + n · ∇ H u · n ) + b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 H u · n ( A - 10 ) + ∂E ∂c ∂ t c d A + (cid:90) Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ρ∂ t u · u d x , where ∂E ∂c = 1 2 b (cid:48) ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 − b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) H (cid:48) 0 ( c ) . ( A - 11 ) The above expression involves the time derivative of curvature . For this quantity to make sense , H must be extended oﬀ Γ , at least in a small neighborhood . The natural extension is such that H ( x ) for x / ∈ Γ is the curvature of the unique surface containing x which assumes a ﬁxed distance to Γ . Next , let us assume the following balance laws for momentum and mass conservation : ρ ( ∂ t u + u · ∇ u ) − ∇ · ( ν D ) + ∇ p = 0 in Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ( Navier - Stokes ) ( A - 12 ) ∇ · u = 0 in Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ( incompressibility ) ( A - 13 ) ∇ Γ · u = 0 on Γ ( inextensibility ) ( A - 14 ) ∂ t c + u · ∇ c = 0 on Γ ( species advection ) ( A - 15 ) where D = ∇ u + ∇ u T . We assume pure advection here for the CIM concentra - tion . Additionally we assume the jump conditions for velocity and ﬂow stress tensor [ u ] 21 = 0 ( A - 16 ) [ − p I + ν D ] 21 · n = F + ∇ Γ λ − H n λ ( A - 17 ) where λ is a Lagrange multiplier that provides the tension needed to enforce local inextensibility ( Eq . ( A - 14 ) ) . This is as an analogue of the pressure in the momentum equation , which is used to enforce local incompressibility of the ﬂuid . The surface force F is yet unspeciﬁed and will be chosen later such that 23 thermodynamically consistency is assured . As shown in Appendix A . 3 , the time derivative of the curvature is ∂ t H = − ∆ Γ ( u · n ) . ( A - 18 ) Using Eqs . ( A - 12 ) - ( A - 15 ) and ( A - 18 ) , the time derivative of the energy becomes ∂ t E = (cid:90) Γ b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) ( − ∆ Γ + n · ∇ H ) u · n ) + b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 H u · n ( A - 19 ) − ∂E ∂c ∇ c · u d A + (cid:90) Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 − ρ u · ∇ u · u − u · ∇ p + u · ∇ · ( ν D ) d x . Integration by parts ( 6 times ) gives ∂ t E = (cid:90) Γ − ∆ Γ ( b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) ) u · n + b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) n · ∇ H u · n ( A - 20 ) + b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 H u · n − ∂E ∂c ∇ c · u + u · [ − p I + ν D ] 21 · n d A − (cid:90) Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ν 2 | D | 2 d x . Using Eq . ( A - 17 ) and (cid:90) Γ u · ( ∇ Γ λ − H n λ ) = (cid:90) Γ − λ ∇ Γ · u = 0 , ( A - 21 ) gives ∂ t E = (cid:90) Γ − ∆ Γ ( b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) ) u · n + b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) n · ∇ H u · n ( A - 22 ) + b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 H u · n − ∂E ∂c ∇ c · u + u · F d A − (cid:90) Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ν 2 | D | 2 d x . Furthermore , we compute n · ∇ H = n · ∇ · ( ∇ n T ) = ∇ · ( n · ∇ n ) − ∇ n T : ∇ n = 0 − ∇ n : ∇ n = −(cid:107)∇ Γ n (cid:107) 2 , ( A - 23 ) where we have used that H = ∇ · n and ∇ n T = ∇ n = ∇ Γ n . Using Eq . ( A - 23 ) ∂ t E = (cid:90) Γ − ∆ Γ ( b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) ) u · n − b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) (cid:107)∇ Γ n (cid:107) 2 u · n ( A - 24 ) + b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 H u · n − ∂E ∂c ∇ c · u + u · F d A − (cid:90) Ω 1 ∪ Ω 2 ν 2 | D | 2 d x . 24 The second law of thermodynamics requires the energy to be non - increasing , which can be accomplished with the choice of F = ∆ Γ ( b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) ) n + b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) (cid:107)∇ Γ n (cid:107) 2 n ( A - 25 ) − b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 H n + ∂E ∂c ∇ c . Hence , a thermodynamically consistent evolution of the membrane and the species concentration is given by Eqs . ( A - 12 ) - ( A - 15 ) with the stress jump con - dition [ − p I + ν D ] · n = ∇ Γ λ − H n λ + ∆ Γ ( b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) ) n ( A - 26 ) + b ( c ) ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) (cid:107)∇ Γ n (cid:107) 2 n − b ( c ) 2 ( H − H 0 ( c ) ) 2 H n + ∂E ∂c ∇ c This is consistent with the jump condition derived in [ 20 ] , although we have presented a simpler derivation . Putting everything together , a thermodynam - ically consistent model for a CIM - covered membrane in viscous ﬂuids is given by Eqs . ( A - 12 ) - ( A - 15 ) together with jump condition ( A - 26 ) . A . 3 . Curvature time derivative We will now calculate the time derivative of the curvature ∂ t H used in Sec - tion A . 2 . Note that this is not the advected time derivative ( material derivative ) . Hence , for this expression to make sense we assume H to be extended oﬀ Γ , at least in a small neighborhood . The natural extension is such that H ( x ) for x / ∈ Γ is the curvature of a curve passing through x parallel to Γ . To compute ∂ t H we introduce a phase ﬁeld φ to represent the interface position . The normal is given by ∇ φ / | ∇ φ | and hence ∂ t H = ∂ t ∇ · ∇ φ | ∇ φ | = ∇ · ∂ t ∇ φ | ∇ φ | = ∇ · (cid:18) ∇ ∂ t φ | ∇ φ | − ∇ φ ∇ φ · ∇ ∂ t φ | ∇ φ | 3 (cid:19) = ∇ · (cid:18) P ∇ ∂ t φ | ∇ φ | (cid:19) . Now , since Γ ( and hence also φ ) are advected : ∂ t φ = − u · ∇ φ . We obtain ∂ t H = − ∇ · (cid:18) ∇ Γ ( u · ∇ φ ) | ∇ φ | (cid:19) = − ∇ · (cid:18) ∇ Γ ( u · n ) + u · ∇ φ ∇ Γ | ∇ φ | | ∇ φ | 2 (cid:19) = − ∇ · ( ∇ Γ ( u · n ) ) = − ∆ Γ ( u · n ) , as claimed . 25 References [ 1 ] S .
