3177 Research Article Introduction Fertilization triggers rapid and synchronous exocytosis of a number of secretory vesicles ( cortical granules ) from the newly fertilized embryo . These vesicles deliver components that have essential functions in blocking polyspermy , promoting egg activation and enabling embryonic development by restructuring the extracellular environment around the embryo ( Wong and Wessel , 2006 ) . Despite the fundamental nature of these events , the molecular machinery that mediates exocytosis of these vesicles is largely unknown . C . elegans has emerged as a highly amenable model system for the study of oogenesis , fertilization and embryogenesis . One of the key advantages of this system is the ability to observe directly all of these processes within the intact living animal . In C . elegans , the germ cells of adult hermaphrodites are contained within a U - shaped tubular gonad ( McCarter et al . , 1999 ) ( see Fig . 1D ) . Germ cells in the most distal region of the gonad arm are in mitosis and enter meiosis as they move away from the distal tip . Oocytes first appear near the bend region of the gonad arm , and grow as they move towards the region proximal to the spermatheca . Such oocytes are arrested in diakinesis of meiotic prophase I and do not re - enter meiosis until they receive signals from the sperm and the overlying gonadal sheath cells , which promote oocyte maturation and ovulation . Upon receiving these signals , the mature oocyte in the most proximal region ovulates and enters the spermatheca , followed by immediate fertilization in the spermatheca . After fertilization , embryos complete meiosis I and meiosis II , and start zygotic development in the uterus . Caveolin is the major protein component required for the formation of caveolae on the plasma membrane ( PM ) of mammalian cells ( Drab et al . , 2001 ) . C . elegans has two caveolin homologues , the CAV - 1 and CAV - 2 proteins ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) . Endogenous CAV - 1 is expressed strongly in the germ line of adult hermaphrodites ( Scheel et al . , 1999 ) . To analyze caveolin dynamics in vivo , we previously imaged a fusion of CAV - 1 with the green fluorescent protein ( CAV - 1 : : GFP ) in living animals , and showed that trafficking of CAV - 1 : : GFP is dynamically regulated during the development of the germ line and embryos ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) ( see Fig . 1D ) . CAV - 1 : : GFP is first localized primarily to the PM in the distal germ cells , and then as oocytes grow it also gradually appears in small intracellular vesicles and unique ring - shaped structures ( CAV - 1 bodies ) derived from the Golgi in an ARF - 1 - dependent manner . We found that immediately after fertilization , the CAV - 1 bodies synchronously fuse with the PM and that this exocytosis is tightly linked to meiotic cell cycle progression in embryos . Thus , the CAV - 1 bodies behave like cortical granules . After fertilization , C . elegans zygotes secrete components of the chitinous eggshell and peri - vitelline fluid , specialized types of extracellular matrices ( ECMs ) that form an osmotic and mechanical barrier around the embryo . The eggshell contains three distinct layers , with each layer formed at different times ( Rappleye et al . , 1999 ) . Peri - vitelline fluid contains abundant glycoproteins and fills the extra - embryonic space between the PM of zygotes and the chitinous eggshell . The proper formation of these ECMs is required for meiotic fidelity , polar body extrusion and embryonic polarization We previously identified a novel type of caveolin - enriched secretory vesicle in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes . These vesicles undergo synchronous fusion with the plasma membrane immediately after fertilization , suggesting that they could be cortical granules that have been described in diverse animal species . Here , we report that these vesicles are indeed cortical granules , delivering essential chondroitin proteoglycans and mucin - like glycoproteins to the early embryonic extracellular matrices ( ECMs ) . Furthermore , we have found that the small GTPase RAB - 11 and the target - SNARE SYN - 4 are required for cortical granule excoytosis after fertilization . In oocytes , SYN - 4 localizes mainly to the plasma membrane , whereas GFP : : RAB - 11 accumulates transiently on the cortical granules during ovulation , immediately prior to fertilization . Importantly , cytokinesis defects in early embryos are commonly observed after depletion of either rab - 11 or syn - 4 , producing a phenotype very similar to that observed after blockade of chondroitin synthesis . Taken together , our results indicate that at least part of the essential role for RAB - 11 and SYN - 4 in early embryogenesis is in the targeting of cortical granules to the plasma membrane during the precisely regulated secretion of ECM components .

Recent studies in many systems have revealed that ECMs not only provide structural support but also actively affect cell behaviors by regulating the micro - environment . Among these ECMs , chondroitin proteoglycans are widely expressed in the various tissues of animals and play important roles in development , cell adhesion , cell proliferation and morphogenesis ( Schwartz and Domowicz , 2002 ) . Strikingly , in C . elegans , chondroitin is abundant in the extra - embryonic space in fertilized eggs and is essential for embryonic cytokinesis , as well as normal eggshell formation ( Hwang et al . , 2003 ; Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ) . Here , we identify chondroitin and mucin - like glycoproteins as physiological cargos of the CAV - 1 bodies , indicating that CAV - 1 bodies are cortical granules of C . elegans . Moreover , we show that the small GTPase RAB - 11 . 1 and the syntaxin 1 homolog SYN - 4 are required for the exocytosis of the CAV - 1 bodies / cortical granules and the delivery of these ECM components after fertilization . Results CAV - 1 bodies are cortical granules that deliver chondroitin proteoglycans to the extracellular space after fertilization To address the physiological role of the CAV - 1 body , we sought to identify its cargo . Our previous experiments showed that CAV - 1 bodies are not labeled by FM4 - 64 or Nile Red , which are markers for endocytic compartments and neutral lipids , respectively ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) . Rather , our previous work indicated that CAV - 1 bodies are regulated secretory vesicles whose exocytosis appears to be coincident with eggshell formation . Furthermore , as described below , conditions that inhibit CAV - 1 body exocytosis result in the production of osmotically sensitive embryos , a phenotype associated with a defective eggshell ( supplementary material Fig . S1A - C ) . Thus , we hypothesized that the CAV - 1 bodies might be C . elegans cortical granules , delivering glycoproteins to the egg surface required for eggshell formation and / or filling of the extra - embryonic space between the zygote and eggshell . Morphologically , the C . elegans eggshell consists of three layers : an outer layer derived from the vitelline membrane of the oocytes , a middle chitinous layer and an inner lipid - rich layer ( Rappleye et al . , 1999 ) . The chitinous layer is formed around embryos immediately after fertilization by chitin synthase CHS - 1 , which resides at the oocyte PM and catalyzes the polymerization of UDP - N - acetylglucosamine to produce the extracellular chitin layer ( Maruyama et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . The inner proteolipid layer is formed later , immediately before the first zygotic cell division . The C . elegans eggshell not only functions as an osmotic and mechanical barrier , but also provides a necessary framework for early embryogenic processes . Defects in the eggshell are known to cause loss of meiotic fidelity , polar body extrusion and embryonic polarization ( Johnston et al . , 2006 ) . We directly examined whether the CAV - 1 bodies contain glycoproteins consisting of the eggshell and the peri - vitelline space . Chondroitin proteoglycans are known to be abundant components of the C . elegans eggshell and the peri - vitelline space , and as such represent candidate cargo molecules for CAV - 1 bodies ( Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ) . Chondroitin is synthesized by the germ cells and gradually accumulates in oocytes as they grow ( Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ) . Consistent with chondroitin proteoglycans residing with CAV - 1 bodies prior to their secretion , we found that an anti - chondroitin antibody stained ring - shaped structures in the oocytes that colocalized extensively with CAV - 1 : : GFP ( Fig . 1A ) . Mucin - Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 19 ) Fig . 1 . CAV - 1 bodies / cortical granules deliver chondroitin proteoglycans to extracellular space after fertilization . ( A , B ) The gonads of transgenic animals expressing CAV - 1 : : GFP were stained with an anti - chondroitin antibody ( A ) or WGA - TRITC ( B ) . CAV - 1 bodies were stained with the anti - chondroitin antibody and WGA - TRITC , indicating that these structures contain chondroitin proteoglycans and mucin - like glycoproteins . ( C ) The gonads of N2 wild - type worms were stained with anti - chondroitin antibody and WGA - TRITC . The right panels are 4 (cid:2) enlargements of the boxed area indicated in merged images .

Schematic localization of CAV - 1 : : GFP is indicated in green . Chondroitin proteoglycans and mucin - like glycoproteins are indicated in orange . Developmental events are assembly - line - like processes and take place at indicated positions of the germline . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3179 Trafficking of chondroitin in C . elegans like glycoproteins are also known to be abundant constituents of the eggshell and the peri - vitelline space of embryos , and can be detected by wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) ( Johnston et al . , 2006 ; Natsuka et al . , 2005 ) . WGA also stains rings in the oocytes ( Bembenek et al . , 2007 ) and exhibited extensive colocalization with CAV - 1 : : GFP ( Fig . 1B ) . Immunostaining of dissected gonads from wild - type hermaphrodites with anti - chondroitin antibody and WGA showed that chondroitin and mucin - like glycoproteins are present in the same large vesicles in wild - type oocytes , indicating that these regulated secretory granules exist in the wild type and are not dependent on CAV - 1 : : GFP expression ( Fig . 1C ) . Taken together , we conclude that CAV - 1 bodies are C . elegans cortical granules that deliver chondroitin proteoglycans and mucin - like glycoproteins as intrinsic cargos . It should be noted that , in the gonad , we detected mucin - like glycoproteins in both the CAV - 1 bodies and on the oocyte surface , while staining with anti - chondroitin antibody appeared to be specific to the CAV - 1 bodies prior to fertilization , implying that the timing of chondroitin secretion is highly regulated . RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 are required for exocytosis of cortical granules In wild - type zygotes , CAV - 1 bodies / cortical granules undergo nearly synchronous exocytosis during anaphase of meiosis I ( Sato et al . , 2006 ; Bombenek et al . , 2007 ) . After exocytosis , most CAV - 1 : : GFP is rapidly endocytosed and degraded within one cell cycle ( Fig . 2B ; supplementary material Movie 1 ) ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) . To understand the molecular mechanisms mediating delivery of cortical granules to the PM , we examined the effects of RNAi - mediated depletion of each C . elegans rab family GTPase on CAV - 1 : : GFP localization in oocytes and embryos ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) . Rab GTPase family proteins play pivotal roles in vesicular transport , and each step of vesicular transport is thought to be regulated by at least one Rab protein ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Among the 30 rab genes in C . elegans , we found that knockdown of rab - 11 . 1 affected cortical granules exocytosis without apparently affecting their biogenesis ( Fig . 2C , D ) . rab - 11 . 1 is a homologue of Rab11 , which is implicated in the Golgi - to - PM transport and endocytic recycling in mammalian systems . As complete knockout of the rab - 11 . 1 gene ( tm2341 ) resulted in zygotic lethality ( see Materials and Methods ) , we used rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) animals for further experiments . In oocytes of rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) animals , CAV - 1 : : GFP and mucin - like glycoproteins accumulated together in characteristic ring - shaped structures , suggesting that cortical granule formation was not severely impaired ( Fig . 3A ) . However , the intracellular distribution of cortical granules was aberrant after rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) . Cortical granules labeled by CAV - 1 : : GFP appeared abnormally clustered around the nuclear envelope in the proximal oocytes of rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) animals , less evenly dispersed in the cytoplasm than in wild - type oocytes ( Fig . 2C , arrowheads ) . Knockdown of rab - 11 . 1 strongly inhibited exocytosis of the cortical granules , resulting in retention of cortical granules in embryos long after their entry into the uterus ( Fig . 2D ) . These CAV - 1 : : GFP - positive vesicles in arrested rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) embryos were stained with WGA , indicating that they are persisting cortical granules rather than endocytic intermediates that are involved in degrading previously exocytosed CAV - 1 : : GFP ( Fig . 3C ) . In addition to Rab GTPases , docking and fusion of vesicles with their target membranes is regulated by the assembly of vesicle - Fig . 2 . RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 are required for exocytosis of cortical granules . The subcellular localization of CAV - 1 : : GFP was determined in mock ( A , B ) , rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) ( C , D ) , syn - 4 ( RNAi ) ( E , F ) and emb - 27 ( RNAi ) ( G , H ) animals by confocal laser microscopy . ( A ) In mock RNAi - treated animals , CAV - 1 : : GFP gradually appears in ring - shaped structures ( CAV - 1 bodies / cortical granules , the inset ) as oocytes grow . ( B ) The cortical granules are synchronously exocytosed in fertilized embryos and CAV - 1 : : GFP targeted to the PM is then internalized for degradation within one - cell cycle . ( C - F ) RNAi of rab - 11 . 1 or syn - 4 causes accumulation of cortical granules around the nuclear envelope in oocytes ( C , E , arrowheads ) and inhibits fusion of cortical granules with the PM in embryos after fertilization ( D , F ) . In the emb - 27 ( RNAi ) worm , the localization of CAV - 1 : : GFP is normal in oocytes ( G ) but cortical granules remain in embryos ( H ) . Oocytes and embryos are maturated from left to right . The numbers indicate the positions of oocytes and embryos from the spermatheca . The insets show 2 (cid:2) enlargements of the boxed area . Scale bars : 10 μ m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3180 SNARE ( v - SNARE ) and target - localized SNARE ( t - SNARE ) proteins ( Hong , 2005 ) . Among the 10 genes encoding syntaxin related t - SNAREs in C . elegans , knockdown of syn - 4 led to a very similar phenotype to that observed in the rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) animals ( Fig . 2E , F ) . By sequence similarity , SYN - 4 is predicted to belong to the syntaxin 1 subfamily , t - SNARE proteins that are involved in the Golgi - to - PM transport in mammals ( Lafont et al . , 1999 ) . Complete knockout of the syn - 4 gene ( ok372 ) caused a maternal effect sterile phenotype , presumably owing to abnormal gonadogenesis ( supplementary material Fig . S2 ) . In syn - 4 ( RNAi ) animals , cortical granules containing mucin - like glycoproteins were generated but appeared clustered around the nucleus in the proximal oocytes ( Fig . 2E ; Fig . 3B ) . In syn - 4 ( RNAi ) embryos , the cortical granules remained in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2F ; Fig . 3D ) . These results suggest that RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 both function in targeting of the cortical granules to the PM . RAB - 11 . 1 transiently localizes to cortical granules in oocytes In order to determine whether RAB - 11 . 1 is directly involved in cortical granules exocytosis , we analyzed the subcellular localization of RAB - 11 . 1 in live animals by using a transgenic line expressing low - levels of GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 in the germline . In growing oocytes GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 mainly localized to tubulovesicular structures beneath the PM , probably representing endocytic recycling compartments ( Fig . 4A , B , – 2 and – 3 oocytes ) . Some GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 localized to the Golgi - like punctate structures deeper in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 4A , arrowheads ) . Interestingly , we observed that in ovulating oocytes the cortical localization of GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 disappeared and GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 accumulated transiently in characteristic ring - shaped structures ( the oocyte labeled as – 1 in Fig . 4A , B ) . GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 was observed on similar ring - shaped structures in early one - cell stage embryos , but was only detected on smaller punctate structures and the PM in later stage embryos ( Fig . 4C ) . To verify localization of RAB - 11 . 1 on the cortical granules , we examined the behavior of GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 under conditions that prevent entry into anaphase I of meiosis , the cell cycle stage during which cortical granules are exocytosed . C . elegans emb - 27 encodes an ortholog of the cdc16p subunit of the anaphase - promoting complex ( APC ) that is essential for meiotic cell cycle progression ( Golden et al . , 2000 ) . Knockdown of emb - 27 results in accumulation of one - cell stage embryos arrested in metaphase of meiosis I ( Golden et al . , 2000 ) and blocks the fusion of cortical granules to the PM ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) . In emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos , the cortical granules resided close to the PM but never fused with the PM ( Fig . 2G , H ) . We found that in emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 localized to the ring - shaped structures for a prolonged period after fertilization , suggesting that the GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 - positive structures are the cortical granules ( Fig . 4D ) . In aged emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos , some of the GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 population was released from the ring - shaped structures and redistributed to large cytoplasmic foci ( Fig . 4D , asterisks ) . Finally , we confirmed that GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 localized to WGA - positive vesicles in the early one - cell stage wild - type embryos ( Fig . 4E - H ) . These results demonstrate that GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 transiently accumulates on the cortical granules shortly before their synchronous exocytosis , suggesting a direct role for RAB - 11 . 1 in cortical granule exocytosis . SYN - 4 and SNB - 1 , a synaptobrevin homolog , localizes to cortical granules It has previously been reported that endogenous SYN - 4 localizes mainly to the PM in oocytes , consistent with a predicted function for SYN - 4 in secretion ( Fig . 5A ) ( Jantsch - Plunger and Glotzer , 1999 ) . We re - evaluated this using the original SYN - 4 antibodies , and found that SYN - 4 is also present in cortical granules , especially in the most proximal oocytes ( Fig . 5A , arrowheads ) . We also sought a corresponding v - SNARE , which localizes on the cortical granules . We found that endogenous VAMP1 homolog SNB - 1 colocalized with CAV - 1 : : GFP and WGA on ring - shaped structures in oocytes , demonstrating that SNB - 1 is expressed in the germline and localizes on the cortical granules ( Fig . 5B , C ) . In oocytes , SNB - 1 was also found on cytoplasmic small vesicles and on the PM . Although SNB - 1 is one of the worm homologues of synaptobrevin that is required for normal neuronal functions ( Nonet et al . , 1998 ) , its localization and role in the germline has not been previously addressed . We further confirmed that GFP : : SNB - 1 or mCherry : : SNB - 1 expressed in the germline showed a very similar localization pattern to that of endogenous Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 19 ) Fig . 3 . Cortical granule exocytosis requires RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 . ( A , B ) Cortical granule formation is not impaired by rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) and syn - 4 ( RNAi ) . The gonad of rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) or syn - 4 ( RNAi ) animals were stained with WGA - TRITC . ( C , D ) Cortical granule exocytosis is inhibited in rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) and syn - 4 ( RNAi ) embryos . Embryos were dissected out from the adult worms and stained with WGA - TRITC . Multinucleated embryos arrested at the one - cell stage are shown . The insets show 2 (cid:2) enlargements of the boxed area . Scale bars : 10 μ m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3181 Trafficking of chondroitin in C . elegans SNB - 1 in oocytes , and that mCherry : : SNB - 1 also colocalized with CAV - 1 : : GFP on the cortical granules ( Fig . 5D ; supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . As snb - 1 knockout animals ( js124 ) die at the L1 larval stage and never become adult ( Nonet et al . , 1998 ) , we examined the effect of RNAi knockdown or a partial loss of function mutant of snb - 1 ( md247 ) on the cortical granule exocytosis . However , we could not detect any obvious defects in the cortical granule exocytosis under these conditions ( supplementary material Fig . S4A , B ) . RNAi of snb - 1 did not phenocopy the L1 lethality of snb - 1 ( js124 ) , suggesting some residual SNB - 1 activity after RNAi . To examine the efficiency of RNAi - mediated depletion of SNB - 1 in the germline , animals expressing GFP : : SNB - 1 in the germline were subjected to snb - 1 RNAi ( supplementary material Fig . S4C ) . The level of GFP - SNB - 1 was reduced to about 5 % of that in mock - treated control animals . The lack of the phenotype might be due to residual SNB - 1 activity or redundancy among v - SNAREs . In fertilized embryos , CAV - 1 : : GFP is targeted to the PM and quickly internalized for degradation within one cell cycle ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . Interestingly , GFP : : SNB - 1 stably localized to the PM and small cytoplasmic vesicles in embryos ( Fig . 5E ) . This observation suggests that degradation of maternal CAV - 1 : : GFP in fertilized embryos is a selective process rather than a bulk degradation of membrane proteins . RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 are required for proper eggshell formation and cytokinesis As RAB - 11 and SYN - 4 are key trafficking regulators and we found that they are enriched on cortical granules prior to and during their exocytosis , we sought to determine whether these proteins are required for secretion of cortical granule components . Genome - wide RNAi analysis has previously reported that rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) and syn - 4 ( RNAi ) embryos are osmotically sensitive ( Sonnichsen et al . , 2005 ) . We confirmed these findings ( supplementary material Fig . S1B , C ) . This phenotype indicates that the innermost ‘lipid - rich’ eggshell layer , which is known to provide an osmotic barrier function , is probably defective in these embryos ( Rappleye et al . , 1999 ) . The cortical granule cargo chondroitin and mucin - like glycoproteins are eggshell components , and failure to secrete these components could explain the osmotic sensitivity that was observed . To test directly the integrity of the eggshell barrier to small molecules , we examined permeability of embryos to the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 . FM4 - 64 cannot normally pass through the mature eggshell , preventing staining of the cells within . Conversely , mutant embryos with a defective eggshell inner layer are known to stain with FM4 - 64 ( Johnston et al . , 2006 ; Rappleye et al . , 1999 ) . Although the immature eggshell surrounding the embryo just after fertilization is permeable to FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 6A , an embryo labeled as + 1 ) , embryos with a complete eggshell are protected from contact Fig . 4 . Dynamic behavior of GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 during oocyte - embryo transition . ( A , B ) Subcellular localization of GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 in wild - type oocytes . GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 localizes to the cortical region in growing oocytes ( – 3 and – 2 oocytes ) but transiently accumulates on the ring - like structures in the ovulating oocyte ( – 1 oocyte ) . Arrowheads indicate Golgi - like punctate structures deeper in the cytoplasm . Middle ( A ) and top ( B ) focal planes are shown .

GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 stably localizes on the ring - shaped structures in + 1 and + 2 embryos arrested at the one - cell stage . Some GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 localizes on large cytoplasmic foci in + 3 embryo ( asterisks ) . Insets in A - D show 2 (cid:2) enlargements of the boxed areas . ( E - H ) GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 localizes on cortical granules in wild - type one - cell stage embryos . Embryos were dissected from animals expressing GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 and stained sequentially with WGA - TRITC and an anti - GFP antibody . Enlarged images of the boxed area in E are shown in F - H . Arrowheads show colocalization of GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 and WGA . Scale bars : 10 μ m in A - E ; 2 . 5 μ m in H . SP , spermatheca . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3182 with the dye and remain unlabeled ( Fig . 6A , + 2 and + 3 embryos ) . emb - 27 ( RNAi ) and rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) embryos , which fail in cortical granule exocytosis , stained readily with FM4 - 64 , indicating a defective eggshell ( Fig . 6B , C ) . However the FM4 - 64 staining pattern appeared somewhat different in emb - 27 ( RNAi ) and rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) embryos , implying that although both depletions lead to permeable eggshells , emb - 27 ( RNAi ) and rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) differ to some extent in their defective osmotic support or cellular osmoregulation . We also examined chitin layer formation in the eggshell that is directly synthesized by chitin synthase CHS - 1 on the PM . When wild - type animals were fixed and incubated with a fluorescently labeled chitin - binding domain ( ChBD ) , a commercial chitin - specific probe , the eggshell of one - cell stage embryos was stained ( Zhang et al . , 2005 ) ( Fig . 7A ) . However , most embryos at the two - cell or later stages remained unstained , suggesting that the accessibility of the ChBD probe to the chitinous middle eggshell layer is blocked in fully matured eggshells ( Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . We also observed that very early embryos , as identified by the cortical granules that had not yet been exocytosed , were stained with ChBD , indicating that chitin deposition precedes deposition of the chondroitin - rich lipid layer ( data not shown ) . In emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos in which cortical granule exocytosis was blocked , ChBD labeled the embryo next to the spermatheca , indicating that chitin synthesis and remodeling are independent of cortical granule exocytosis and occurs prior to or during metaphase I ( Fig . 7C ) . As in wild type , older emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos were not labeled , indicating that maturation of the eggshell necessary for ChBD exclusion also occurs without cortical granule exocytosis or proper cell - cycle progression . However , we found that in rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) animals , most embryos were uniformly stained with ChBD , suggesting that rab - 11 . 1 is also involved in a cortical granule exocytosis - independent pathway that normally confers ChBD inaccessibility to the chitin layer of the eggshell ( Fig . 7B ) . It has been previously reported that both rab - 11 . 1 and syn - 4 are required for embryonic cytokinesis ; RNAi of ether gene results in multinucleated embryos ( Jantsch - Plunger and Glotzer , 1999 ; Skop et al . , 2001 ) . We confirmed this observation for rab - 11 . 1 and syn - 4 , finding multinucleated embryos after RNAi for either gene ( supplementary material Fig . S1D - F ) . Notably , deficiency of chondroitin proteoglycans , which are the cargo of the cortical granules , is known to result in a similar cytokinesis defects in early embryos ( Hwang et al . , 2003 ; Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ; Olson et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , our results suggest that the cytokinesis defects caused by depletion of rab - 11 . 1 or syn - 4 is due , at least in part , to the failure in cortical granule exocytosis , resulting in failure to deliver chondroitin proteoglycans to the extra - embryonic space . CAV - 1 is not essential for eggshell formation Given how well CAV - 1 marks the cortical granules , we considered that it might be required for cortical granule biogenesis or function . To address this issue , we first analyzed a deletion mutant , cav - 1 ( ok2089 ) , that lacks the entire coding region of the cav - 1 gene . We found that this mutant produces a normal number of embryos without any detectable defect in eggshell formation ( supplementary material Table S1 , data not shown ) . These embryos were not stained with FM4 - 64 beyond the one - cell stage , and were not sensitive to changes in the ionic strength of the media ( data not shown ) . When the gonads were dissected from the mutant animals and stained with WGA , we observed normal cortical granule morphology and number in the oocytes ( Fig . 8B ) . We considered that CAV - 1 might be functionally redundant with the only other worm caveolin , CAV - Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 19 ) Fig . 5 .

( A , B ) The gonads of animals expressing CAV - 1 : : GFP were stained with anti - SYN - 4 ( A ) or anti - SNB - 1 ( B ) antibodies . SYN - 4 localizes mainly on the PM but a part of SYN - 4 is detected on cortical granules ( arrowheads in A ) . SNB - 1 localizes on the cortical granules ( arrowheads in B ) and small cytoplasmic vesicles . ( C ) The gonads of wild - type animals were stained with anti - SNB - 1 antibody and WGA - TRITC .

Unlike CAV - 1 : : GFP , GFP : : SNB - 1 is not degraded in embryos and the GFP signal is stably detected in developing embryos ( E ) . The insets show 2 (cid:2) enlargements of the boxed areas . Scale bars : 10 μ m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3183 Trafficking of chondroitin in C . elegans 2 . However , we likewise found that double - knockout mutants lacking both caveolins [ cav - 1 ( ok2089 ) ; cav - 2 ( hc191 ) ] displayed a nearly normal brood size and normal cortical granule morphology and number , and the double mutant eggshell was impermeable to FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 8D , supplementary material Table S1 , data not shown ) . These results indicate that worm caveolins themselves are not essential components of cortical granule biogenesis or exocytosis , although CAV - 1 : : GFP is an abundant cargo molecule of these vesicles . However , cav - 1 ( ok2089 ) and the cav - 1 ( ok2089 ) ; cav - 2 ( hc191 ) double mutants showed a slightly slower rate of egg laying compared with that of wild - type animals , implying that CAV - 1 has some function to maintain the normal rate of egg production . Discussion In our previous work , we have identified large vesicles in the oocyte that are enriched in CAV - 1 : : GFP protein ( CAV - 1 bodies ) . The fusion of these vesicles with the embryo PM immediately after fertilization , in a nearly synchronous wave , suggested that these vesicles could be cortical granules , as defined in the oocytes of other animals ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) . In this study , we further demonstrate that these vesicles deliver chondroitin and mucin - like glycoproteins to the extracellular space , molecules that are required for eggshell formation and / or cytokinesis in the early embryo ( Hwang et al . , 2003 ; Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ) . We now also show that RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 , a GTPase and a syntaxin 1 homolog , respectively , are each required for regulated cortical granule ( CAV - 1 body ) exocytosis . Cortical granules transport extracellular matrix components essential for early embryogenesis Proteoglycans play important roles in animal development by modulating the extracellular environment . In C . elegans , chondroitin is known to be required for early embryogenesis and vulva morphogenesis ( Hwang et al . , 2003 ; Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ) . Chondroitin proteoglycans consist of core proteins and covalently attached chondroitin chains . Chondroitin is synthesized on a unique tetrasaccharide linker structure ( GlcA β 1 , 3Gal β 1 , 3Gal β 1 , 4Xyl1 β ) that is built onto specific serine residues of the core proteins , followed by the polymerization of the chain by the addition of N - acetylgalactosamine ( GalNac ) and glucuronic acid ( Hwang et al . , 2003 ; Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ) . Chain initiation and elongation of chondroitin is catalyzed by chondroitin synthase , SQV - 5 . Loss of function of sqv - 5 , which is specifically involved in chondroitin synthesis , causes cytokinesis defects in embryos , resulting in multinucleated cells ( Hwang et al . , 2003 ; Mizuguchi et al . , 2003 ) . Recently , CPG - 1 and CPG - 2 , chitin - binding proteins , were identified as core proteins in C . elegans that receive chondroitin modification ( Olson et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with our direct observation of chondroitin in cortical granules , simultaneous depletion of CPG - 1 and CPG - 2 reduces the size of cortical granules ( Bembenek et al . , 2007 ) and produces a cytokinesis phenotype identical to sqv - 5 knockdown ( Olson et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that chondroitin chains on these proteins are important . Strikingly , RNAi of rab - 11 . 1 or syn - 4 leads to a similar cytokinesis defect that results in multinucleated embryos that continue karyokinesis without undergoing cytokinesis ( Jantsch - Plunger and Glotzer , 1999 ; Skop et al . , 2001 ) . Given the observation that chondroitin is an intrinsic cargo of the cortical granules , the impaired secretion of chondroitin proteoglycans after rab - 11 . 1 or syn - 4 depletion explains , at least in part , the cytokinesis defects of these embryos . However , we found that RNAi of rab - 11 . 1 or syn - 4 causes a more severe eggshell defect than does chondroitin deficiency . sqv - 5 ( RNAi ) ( Hwang et al . , 2003 ) and emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos are orderly and oval - shaped in the uterus , whereas knockdown of rab - 11 . 1 or syn - 4 produces irregular - shaped embryos that appear to lack all mechanical support from an eggshell . The pattern of FM4 - 64 staining was also different between rab - Fig . 6 . RAB - 11 . 1 and EMB - 27 are required for proper eggshell formation after fertilization . The permeability of embryos to FM4 - 64 was examined in mock ( A ) , emb - 27 ( RNAi ) ( B ) and rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) ( C ) animals expressing CAV - 1 : : GFP . A newly fertilized wild - type embryo is permeable to FM4 - 64 ( + 1 embryo in A , an arrow indicates the PM stained with FM4 - 64 ) but blastomeres are not ( + 2 and + 3 embryos in A ) . The emb - 27 ( RNAi ) and rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) embryos are permeable to FM4 - 64 . Nomarski image is on the right in each pair . Scale bar : 10 μ m . Fig . 7 . Chitin layer formation is independent of cortical granule exocytosis . Embryos of animals expressing CAV - 1 : : GFP were stained with rhodamine - conjugated chitin - binding domain ( ChBD ) .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3184 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) and emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos . Furthermore , rab - 11 . 1 ( RNAi ) embryos showed abnormal ChBD accessibility . These observations imply that , in addition to the cortical granule exocytosis , RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 are involved in an additional route of exocytosis that delivers different cargos required for complete eggshell formation . These proteins may also contribute to membrane traffic at the cleavage furrow itself . In addition to exocytosis , RAB - 11 could further affect microtubule dynamics , as reported recently ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . We observed that knockdown of syn - 4 inhibits formation of the chitin layer around embryos , implying that syn - 4 ( RNAi ) also contributes to the earlier chitin deposition directly , or may affect other developmental effects such as fertilization or spermatogenesis ( data not shown ) . RAB - 11 . 1 and SYN - 4 regulate developmentally - controlled exocytosis Previous reports indicate that , in sea urchin , Rab3 and a VAMP homologue localize to cortical granules , and injection of a peptide corresponding to the Rab3 effector domain interferes with cortical granule exocytosis ( Conner et al . , 1997 ; Conner and Wessel , 1998 ) . In C . elegans , however , RAB - 3 is predominantly expressed in neurons , and a null mutant , rab - 3 ( js49 ) , is viable and fertile ( Nonet et al . , 1997 ) . Our work indicates that the exocytosis of the cortical granules depends upon the function of RAB11 . 1 and SYN - 4 in C . elegans . In mammalian cells , Rab11 is best known for its role in maintaining the endocytic recycling pathway ( Wilcke et al . , 2000 ) . Indeed , in growing C . elegans oocytes , GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 is concentrated in peripheral tubular recycling endosomes ( Fig . 4 ) . RNAi - mediated depletion of rab - 11 . 1 causes a defect in yolk endocytosis by oocytes due to impaired recycling of the yolk receptor ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ; Sato et al . , 2008 ) . However , we show here that RNAi of rab - 11 . 1 blocked cortical granule exocytosis , and , moreover , that the subcellular localization of GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 shifts from cortical endosomes to the cortical granules during ovulation . Thus , RAB - 11 . 1 seems to have dual roles , i . e . endocytic recycling in oocytes and regulated exocytosis of the cortical granules in embryos , and these two activities are developmentally controlled . In agreement with our findings , recent studies have suggested that Rab11 can be involved in exocytosis ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Satoh et al . , 2005 ; Ward et al . , 2005 ) . For example , Rab11b localizes to mature synaptic vesicles in the brain and functions as a GTP - dependent switch between the constitutive and Ca 2 + - regulated exocytic pathway ( Khvotchev et al . , 2003 ) . Rab11 is also associated with exocytic vesicles that undergo regulated secretion in cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( Menager et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , Rab11 could be involved in regulated exocytic pathways in many cell types . Interestingly , in emb - 27 ( RNAi ) embryos , GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 localized to the cortical granules but fusion was still tightly inhibited . This suggests that recruitment of RAB - 11 . 1 to the cortical granules is not sufficient to drive the cortical granules to fuse with the PM . At least one additional step must be required to allow fusion with the membrane . Consistent with this hypothesis , direct observation indicates that the cortical granules redistribute underneath the PM after fertilization , remain quiescent there for a period of time and then fuse with the PM ( supplementary material Movie 1 ) . It is possible that the APC complex regulates the activity of RAB - 11 . 1 , or some other later exocytic components , to couple transition into anaphase of meiosis I with the secretion of the cortical granules . In other systems , a family of Rab11 - interacting proteins ( FIPs ) , which share the Rab11 - binding domain ( RBD ) , and the exocyst complex are known Rab11 effectors ( Junutula et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . , 2005 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . We find that RNAi - mediated knockdown of exocyst subunits , or of F55C12 . 1 , the sole RBD protein in C . elegans , did not produce any effect on cortical granule dynamics ( M . S . , B . D . G . , A . H . and K . S . , unpublished ) . Thus , cortical granules associated RAB - 11 might function through as yet unidentified effectors to promote this regulated exocytosis . Selective degradation of maternal membrane proteins Selective degradation of maternal cytoplasmic proteins is an important event for the transition of embryos from meiosis to mitosis , and is strictly controlled by cell cycle progression ( Bowerman and Kurz , 2006 ) . Using CAV - 1 : : GFP and GFP : : SNB - 1 , we demonstrated that degradation of membrane proteins after fertilization is highly selective , even if they reached the PM in the same carrier . The yolk receptor RME - 2 and the transmembrane fertilization proteins EGG - 1 and EGG - 2 are also selectively internalized and degraded after fertilization ( Audhya et al . , 2007 ; Balklava et al . , 2007 ; Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ; Kadandale et al . , 2005 ) . These observations imply that selective degradation of maternally provided membrane proteins , as well as cytosolic proteins , occurs in early embryos . The selective degradation of cytosolic proteins is regulated by a ubiquitin - dependent process ( Pellettieri et al . , 2003 ; Srayko et al . , 2000 ) . Mono - ubiquitination of membrane proteins is known to direct their endocytosis ( Hicke and Dunn , 2003 ) . Selective ubiquitination of membrane proteins may be the means by which they are targeted for developmentally timed degradation . Further analysis using this system will offer the opportunity to unveil the molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane trafficking during oogenesis , fertilization and embryogenesis . Materials and Methods General methods and strains Methods for the handling and culturing of C . elegans were essentially those described by Brenner ( Brenner , 1974 ) . Strains expressing GFP : : RAB - 11 . 1 , GFP : : SNB - 1 or GFP : : CAV - 1 were grown at 25°C , and other strains were at 20°C . The wild - type parent for all strains was C . elegans var Bristol strain N2 . unc - 119 ( ed3 ) ( Maduro and Pilgrim , 1995 ) , syn - 4 ; T01B11 . 4 ( ok372 ) , snb - 1 ( md247 ) , cav - 1 ( ok2089 ) and cav - 2 ( hc191 ) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetic Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 19 ) Fig . 8 . Caveolins are not required for cortical granule biogenesis . The gonads were dissected and stained with WGA - TRITC . ( A ) Wild type ; ( B ) cav - 1 ( ok2089 ) ; and ( C ) cav - 1 ( ok2089 ) ; cav - 2 ( hc191 ) . The insets show 1 . 5 (cid:2) enlargements of the boxed areas . Scale bar : 10 μ m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3185 Trafficking of chondroitin in C . elegans Center . A knockout strain of rab - 11 . 1 ( tm2341 ) balanced with a rearrangement hT2 [ bli - 4 ( e937 ) let ( q782 ) qIs48 ] ( I ; III ) was provided by Shohei Mitani of the Japanese National Bioresource Project for nematodes . This rab - 11 . 1 ( tm2341 ) / hT2 heterozygote produces only viable heterozygotes , dead hT2 anuploids / homozygotes and dead embryos lacking hT2 , indicating that rab - 11 . 1 ( tm2341 ) homozygotes are zygotic lethal . Transgenic strains used were pwIs281 [ P pie - 1 : : CAV - 1 : : GFP , unc - 119 ( + ) ] ; pwIs61 [ P pie - 1 : : GFP : : CAV - 1 , unc - 119 ( + ) ] ( Sato et al . , 2006 ) ; pwIs33 [ P pie - 1 : : GFP : : rab - 11 . 1 , unc - 119 ( + ) ] ; dkIs289 [ P pie - 1 : : GFP : : snb - 1 , unc - 119 ( + ) ] ; and dkIs330 [ P pie - 1 : : mCherry : : snb - 1 , unc - 119 ( + ) ] ( this study ) . AZ212 ( unc - 119 ( ed3 ) ruIs32 [ unc - 119 ( + ) P pie - 1 : : GFP : : H2B ] III ) was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center . Plasmids and transgenic C . elegans A genomic fragment containing the snb - 1 - coding region and a cDNA fragment of rab - 11 . 1 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the Entry vector pDONR221 by Gateway recombinational cloning technology ( Invitrogen , CA ) . Then snb - 1 and rab - 11 . 1 were cloned into pID3 . 01 ( Pellettieri et al . , 2003 ) to create an N - terminal GFP fusion . The genomic snb - 1 fragment was also cloned into a destination vector AZ132 _ mCherry _ Gtwy ( a gift from A . Audhya and K . Oegema ) to create a mCherry : : snb - 1 fusion . pID3 . 01 and AZ132 _ mCherry _ Gtwy use pie - 1 5 (cid:3) and 3 (cid:3) UTR sequences that drive expression of the transgene in the maternal germ line . Transgenic lines were created by the microparticle bombardment method as described previously ( Praitis et al . , 2001 ) . cDNAs of rab - 11 . 1 , syn - 4 and snb - 1 were prepared from EST clone provided by Yuji Kohara and subcloned into L4440 . As a negative control of RNAi experiments , L4440 harboring cDNA of human transferrin receptor was used . All other feeding RNAi constructs were obtained from the Ahringer genomic RNAi library ( Kamath and Ahringer , 2003 ) . RNA - mediated interference RNAi experiments in this study were performed using the feeding method ( Timmons et al . , 2001 ) . Except for RNAi of syn - 4 and snb - 1 , L4 larvae were placed on plates containing NGM agar with 5 mM IPTG and HT115 ( DE3 ) bacteria carrying double - stranded RNA expression constructs and allowed to grow up to young adult worms . L1 or L4 larvae were used for RNAi knockdown of syn - 4 and snb - 1 . Then , P 0 and F1 animals were observed . To examine the efficiency of RNAi - mediated depletion of SNB - 1 in the germline , animals expressing GFP : : SNB - 1 in the germline ( dkIs289 ) were subjected to snb - 1 RNAi . Whole - worm lysates were prepared from 40 F1 adults by boiling in Laemmli sampling buffer . Samples were subjected to western blotting using goat anti - GFP antibody ( Research Diagnostics , NJ ) . Microscopy and immunostaining To observe live worms expressing transgenes , worms were mounted on agarose pads with 20 mM levamisole in M9 buffer . Staining of dissected gonads was performed as described previously ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ; Sato et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , dissected gonads were fixed in 1 ml of 1 . 25 % freshly made paraformaldehyde in egg buffer [ 118 mM NaCl , 48 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM HEPES ( pH7 . 3 ) ] and washed four times in 1 ml of PTB ( 1 % BSA , 1 (cid:2) PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween20 , 0 . 05 % NaN 3 , 1 mM EDTA ) for 30 minutes at room temperature . For chondroitin staining , the fixed gonads were treated with 10 mU / μ l chondroitinase ABC ( Seikagaku , Tokyo ) at 37°C for 2 hours and incubated with the anti - chondroitin antibody ( anti - proteoglycan Di - 0S antibody 1 - B - 5 ; Seikagaku , Tokyo ) diluted 1 : 1 , 000 with PTB at 4°C overnight . After washing with PTC ( 0 . 1 % BSA , 1 (cid:2) PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween20 , 0 . 05 % NaN 3 , 1 mM EDTA ) , the gonads were incubated with an antibody against mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa488 or Alexa555 ( Molecular Probes ) for 3 hours at 20°C . The dissected gonads were washed four times with PTC before observation . Fixed gonads were also stained with anti - SYN - 4 and anti - SNB - 1 antibodies ( Jantsch - Plunger and Glotzer , 1999 ; Nonet et al . , 1998 ) and rhodamine - conjugated chitin - binding probe ( New England BioLabs ; 1 : 500 dilution with PTB ) . For wheat - germ agglutinin conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate - dextran ( WGA - TRITC ) ( EY Laboratories , CA ) staining , the dissected gonads were fixed in methanol at – 20°C for 8 minutes , washed with PTB and incubated with WGA - TRITC diluted 1 : 100 with the PTB at 4°C overnight . Embryos were fixed and permeabilized by a freeze – crack method ( Miller and Shakes , 1995 ) . Then embryos were sequentially stained with WGA - TRITC and an anti - GFP antibody ( 3E6 , Q - BIOgene , CA ) . For FM4 - 64 staining , worms were cut in Iwasaki – Teramoto ( I – T ) solution [ 136 mM NaCl , 9 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 77 mM glucose , and 5 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) ] ( Teramoto and Iwasaki , 2006 ) containing 1 mM FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) and incubated for 10 minutes at 20°C . To examine the osmotic sensitivity of embryos , animals were dissected in 300 mM KCl hypertonic solution and embryos were observed in the same solution . All images were obtained using an Olympus confocal microscope system FV1000 ( Olympus , Japan ) .
