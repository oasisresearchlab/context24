Podocytes are specialized cells that play an integral role in the renal glomerular filtration barrier via their foot processes . The foot processes form a highly organized structure , the disruption of which causes nephrotic syndrome . Interestingly , several similarities have been observed between mechanisms that govern podocyte organization and mechanisms that mediate neuronal synapse development . Dyna - min , synaptojanin , and endophilin are functional partners in synaptic vesicle recycling via intercon - nected actions in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and actin dynamics in neurons . A role of dynamin in the maintenance of the kidney filtration barrier via an action on the actin cytoskeleton of podocytes was sug - gested . Here we used a conditional double - KO of dynamin 1 ( Dnm1 ) and Dnm2 in mouse podocytes to confirm dynamin’s role in podocyte foot process maintenance . In addition , we demonstrated that while synaptojanin 1 ( Synj1 ) KO mice and endophilin 1 ( Sh3gl2 ) , endophilin 2 ( Sh3gl1 ) , and endophilin 3 ( Sh3gl3 ) triple - KO mice had grossly normal embryonic development , these mutants failed to establish a nor - mal filtration barrier and exhibited severe proteinuria due to abnormal podocyte foot process formation . These results strongly implicate a protein network that functions at the interface between endocytosis and actin at neuronal synapses in the formation and maintenance of the kidney glomerular filtration barrier . Introduction Nephrotic syndrome is a severe kidney disease involving massive protein loss in the urine due to an impairment of the glomerular filtration barrier between the blood and the urinary space . Podo - cytes , highly specialized cells that line the capillary loops , play a key role in this barrier via their interdigitated foot processes con - nected by a thin diaphragm , the slit diaphragm ( 1 ) . Accordingly , disruption of foot process organization ( a process called efface - ment ) results in nephrotic syndrome ( 2 ) . Several similarities have emerged between protein networks underlying the development and maintenance of podocyte foot processes and those governing the development and function of neuronal synapses ( 3 , 4 ) . A study based on cathepsin - dependent proteolysis or expression of a dominant - negative dynamin mutant in podocytes provided evidence supporting a role of dynamin in foot process maintenance ( 5 ) . Dynamin , which is encoded by 3 genes in mammals ( dynamin 1 [ Dnm1 ] and Dnm3 , which are expressed primarily in brain , and Dnm2 , which is ubiquitously expressed ) , is a GTPase that medi - ates the fission reaction of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 6 , 7 ) . At neuronal synapses , where dynamin is represented primarily by Dnm1 , this protein plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle endocy - tosis and recycling ( 8 – 10 ) . Dynamin has also been implicated in actin dynamics because of its colocalization with Arp2 / 3 - depen - dent actin structures and its direct interaction with actin and with actin - regulatory proteins ( 11 – 13 ) . Genetic studies in mice and humans have demonstrated the critical dependence of podocyte foot process integrity , and thus of kidney filtration barrier func - tion , on actin - regulatory proteins and upstream signaling factors , consistent with actin being a core component for normal podo - cyte architecture ( 14 ) . Thus , it has been proposed that the function of dynamin in podocytes may be mediated by its role in the actin cytoskeleton ( 5 , 11 ) . However , clathrin - coated pits and vesicles are frequently observed in podocyte foot processes ( 15 ) , raising the possibility that endocytic defects may contribute to foot process abnormalities upon disruption of dynamin’s function . In this study , we first addressed the role of dynamin in the stability of podocyte foot processes using a conditional gene KO strategy , and demonstrated that podocyte - selective KO of Dnm1 and Dnm2 resulted in severe proteinuria , renal failure , and foot process effacement . Next , we investigated whether 2 major functional partners of dynamin at neuronal synapses , synaptojanin ( 16 – 18 ) and endophilin ( 19 , 20 ) , are also impli - cated in the formation and maintenance of the kidney glomeru - lar filtration barrier . Synaptojanin , an inositol 5 - phosphatase whose preferred substrates are phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bispho - sphate ( PIP2 ) and phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) , plays a critical role in clathrin - coated dynamics and in the uncoating of newly formed clathrin - coated vesicles ( 17 ) . It is also a negative regulator of actin nucleation and signaling ( 21 , 22 ) . Endophilin is an adaptor that binds the membrane bilayer via its N - terminal region ( which contains a BAR domain and amphipathic helices ) and both dynamin and synaptojanin via its C - terminal SH3 domain , thus helping coordinate the function of these proteins in endocytosis ( 19 , 20 , 23 ) . Analysis of mice harboring germline KO mutations of these proteins showed that while the lack of synaptojanin 1 ( Synj1 ) or of all 3 endophilins Authorship note : Keita Soda and Daniel M .

We further determined that , as at neuronal synapses , all these proteins functioned at sites of clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis in podocytes . Interestingly , dynamin , synaptojanin , and endophilin bound either directly or indirectly to proteins that genetic studies have implicated in human nephrotic syndrome . Our results indicate that a protein network that operates at the interface between endocytosis and actin at neuronal synapses is additionally critical in the formation and maintenance of the kidney glomerular filtration barrier .

We first revisited the role of dynamin in the maintenance of the kidney glomerular filtration barrier using a KO approach . Podocytes were expected to selectively express Dnm2 , the house - keeping and ubiquitous dynamin isoform , whose constitutive KO results in embryonic lethality ( 6 ) . Surprisingly , however , immuno - isolated podocytes ( 24 ) , as validated by their reactivity for the podo - cyte - specific marker WT1 ( Figure 1A ) , were found to express not only Dnm2 , but also Dnm1 ( Figure 1 , B and C ) , the predominantly neuronal dynamin ( 9 ) . Thus , we used previously described Dnm1 fl / fl ; Dnm2 fl / fl mice ( 6 ) and mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the podocin promoter ( Cre expression occurs at E14 ; ref . 25 ) to generate podocyte - specific Dnm1 ; Dnm2 double - KO ( referred to herein as pod - Dnm - DKO ) mice . Such mice appeared normal at birth , but their weight gain fell below that of Dnm1 fl / fl ; Dnm2 fl / fl control mice in the following days ( Supplemental Figure 1B ; sup - plemental material available online with this article ; doi : 10 . 1172 / JCI65289DS1 ) . By 10 weeks of age , they were severely lethargic and much smaller than controls ( Figure 1D ) . More than 75 % of pod - Dnm - DKO mice died between 10 and 12 weeks of age . PCR - based tail genotyping confirmed the presence of the con - ditional dynamin alleles as well as the podocin Cre transgene ( Figure 1E ) , and Western blot analysis of podocytes purified from pod - Dnm - DKO mice revealed that Dnm1 and Dnm2 levels were already somewhat reduced at E16 . 5 relative to control lit - termates ( Figure 1 , B and C , and Supplemental Figure 1A ) . Gene ablation of Dnm1 and Dnm2 expression was further confirmed by immunofluorescence of purified pod - Dnm - DKO podocytes extracted from P21 mice ( Figure 1C ) and of P21 pod - Dnm - DKO kidney sections counterstained with the podocyte - specific pro - tein nephrin ( Figure 1F ) . Importantly , robust albuminuria was detected in the urine of pod - Dnm - DKO mice , as assessed by SDS - PAGE at 4 and 8 weeks ( Figure 1G ) and quantified by ELISA with normalization to urine creatinine at several ages ( Figure 1H and Supplemental Figure 2A ) . Moreover , measurement of plasma cre - atinine levels in pod - Dnm - DKO mice demonstrated severe kidney failure ( Figure 1I and Supplemental Figure 2B ) . The kidney / body weight ratio in pod - Dnm - DKO mice was sig - nificantly reduced at 8 weeks of age ( 50 % reduction ; Supplemental Figure 1C ) , and the kidneys displayed a pale , smaller , and corru - gated appearance ( Supplemental Figure 1D ) . While the kidneys were normal at birth , mesangial expansion and evidence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was observed by 4 weeks of age ( Supplemental Figure 1E ) . By 10 weeks of age , the glomeruli had undergone a process of global sclerosis , and the kidney further demonstrated severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular dilatation with proteinaceous casts ( Supplemental Figure 1F ) . This time course , with normal development but then loss of foot processes , is consistent with induced rather than constitutive loss of dyna - min and with the use of a transgenic mouse in which Cre expres - sion requires podocyte differentiation . Correspondingly , the glomeruli of kidneys from neonatal pod - Dnm - DKO mice appeared relatively normal by electron microsco - py , although heterogeneity was observed , with the occurrence of some effaced capillary loops ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 3A ) . However , at 4 weeks of age , kidneys from pod - Dnm - DKO mice revealed generalized podocyte foot process effacement ( Figure 2 , A and B ) , which became even more severe at 8 weeks ( data not shown ) . Additionally , clathrin - coated pit intermediates were fre - Figure 2 Podocyte foot process effacement in pod - Dnm - DKO mice .

Proteinuria and podocyte foot process effacement in Synj1 KO mice . The severe effect on glomerular filtration produced by the lack of dyna - min selectively in podocytes could in principle be attributed to a critical role of dynamin for the function of any cell in which it is expressed , although cells remain viable in the absence of dynamin ( 6 ) . Thus , we examined the effect on kidney physiology of Synj1 , which functions in close partnership with dynamin at synapses ( 17 , 18 , 26 ) , but does not have critical housekeeping functions . Synj1 KO mice appear grossly normal at birth , although they are neurologi - cally impaired and die within the first few postnatal days ( 17 ) . Synj1 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP2 and PIP3 , 2 phosphoinositides that help recruit endocytic clathrin coats to the plasma membrane and whose dephosphorylation is needed for clathrin uncoating after fission ( 18 , 22 ) . The Synj1 gene encodes 2 major splice variants . The 170 - kDa splice variant Synj1 - 170 , which has a broad tissue distribution ( 27 ) , contains C - terminal binding sites for clathrin as well as other endocytic adaptors , is recruited early to endocyte - coated pits , and remains associated with them throughout their growth ( 28 ) . The 145 - kDa synaptic variant Synj1 - 145 , which is selectively expressed in the developed nervous tissue and is present at very high concentrations at neuronal synapses , is recruited only to late - stage endocytic clathrin - coated pits ( 28 ) . West - ern blotting of isolated podocytes revealed the presence of Synj1 , specifically the Synj1 - 170 isoform ( Figure 3A ) . Correspondingly , Synj1 immunofluorescence demonstrated the punctate pattern of immunoreactivity expected for the clathrin - coated pit localization of this isoform , whereas such reactivity was lost in the podocytes and kidneys of Synj1 KO mice ( Figure 3 , B – D ) . Moreover , Synj1 colocal - ized with nephrin in podocytes within the glomerulus ( Figure 3E ) . Figure 3 Lack of Synj1 results in severe proteinuria and foot process effacement .

Histological examination of neonatal kid - neys revealed that some glomeruli appeared to have mesangial matrix accumulation ( Supplemental Figure 4A ) . Dilated tubules with proteinaceous casts were also present ( Supplemental Figure 4B ) , suggestive of severe proteinuria . Moreover , PIP2 levels , as detected by an HPLC - based method , were 25 % higher in kidneys of newborn KO mice relative to kidneys of control littermates ( Supplemental Figure 4C ) , demonstrating an important effect of Synj1 on PIP2 metabolism in this tissue . Importantly , urine analysis of P1 – P4 Synj1 KO mice revealed prominent albuminuria ( Figure 3F ) that was confirmed by nor - malization to urine creatinine ( Figure 3G and Supplemental Fig - ure 2C ) , consistent with disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier . Accordingly , electron microscopy of kidneys of P1 – P4 Synj1 KO mice revealed massive foot process effacement ( Figure 3H and Supplemental Figure 3A ) . As in pod - Dnm - DKO mice , the podocytes of Synj1 KO mice also exhibited numerous clathrin - coated endocytic intermediates . Significant foot process efface - ment was already observed in E16 . 5 embryos ( Supplemental Figure 4D ) , which indicates that Synj1 is involved not only in the maintenance , but also in the development , of the filtration barrier . Proteinuria and podocyte foot process effacement in endophilin triple - KO ( TKO ) mice . In the nervous system , the effect of the lack of Synj1 ( primarily clathrin uncoating ) is strikingly phenocopied by the lack of endophilin , which indicates that these 2 proteins work closely together ( 20 , 29 – 31 ) . Endophilin is the collective name for 3 very similar proteins , endophilin 1 , 2 , and 3 ( encoded by Sh3gl2 , Sh3gl1 , and Sh3gl3 , respectively ) . Endophilin is recruited to the necks of endocytic clathrin - coated pits by its curvature sensitive BAR domain ( 32 , 33 ) and binds both dynamin and synaptojanin ( with 10 - fold higher affinity for synaptojanin than for dynamin ; refs . 19 , 23 ) via its C - terminal SH3 domain , thus helping recruit these proteins to their sites of action . Thus , it was of interest to determine whether the lack of endophilin phenocopies the lack of Synj1 in the organization of the glomerular filtration barrier . Like Synj1 KO mice , endophilin TKO mice ( with triple - KO of Sh3gl2 , Sh3gl1 , and Sh3gl3 ) have grossly normal embryonic devel - opment , which argues against essential housekeeping functions of endophilin . Like Synj1 KO mice , they die perinatally , at least in part because of impaired neuronal function . Western blot analysis of isolated podocytes demonstrated expression of all 3 endophil - ins that was lost in the endophilin TKO , as expected ( Figure 4A ) . Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections from wild - type newborn mice revealed endophilin 2 expression in control , but not endophilin TKO , podocytes , which were identified by the presence of immunoreactivity for nephrin ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . As observed in Synj1 KO mice , histological examination of the endophilin TKO kidney cortex showed abnormalities in the glomeruli and dilated tubules with proteinaceous casts ( Supplemental Figure 5 , A and B ) . Urine obtained from these mice revealed robust proteinuria , as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining and further validated by normalization to urine creatinine ( Figure 4 , D and E , and Supple - mental Figure 2D ) . Importantly , severe foot process effacement with a thickened glomerular basement membrane was observed by electron microscopy at birth ( Figure 4F and Supplemental Figure 3A ) , as in Synj1 KO mice . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis and actin in podocytes . Collectively , the findings described here suggest that the functional partnership among dynamin , synaptojanin , and endophilin at endocytic sites , Figure 4 Lack of endophilin results in severe proteinuria and foot process effacement .

Akin to what has been proposed for dynamin ( 5 , 11 ) , the action of synaptojanin at podocyte foot processes may be due primarily to an effect on actin , because the substrates of the phosphatase activity of Synj1 ( namely , PIP2 and PIP3 ) are criti - cal and potent regulators of actin nucleation ( 22 , 34 ) . Likewise , endophilin could have a role in actin function via its property to recruit dynamin , synaptojanin ( 19 , 23 ) , and actin - regulatory pro - teins ( 6 , 35 ) . However , it is quite possible that the effects produced by perturbing dynamin , synaptojanin , and endophilin function in podocytes may be mediated primarily by the endocytic roles of these proteins . An even more attractive possibility is that the 2 actions may be tightly interrelated , because actin has been strongly implicated in dynamics of late - stage clathrin - coated pits in a vari - ety of model cell types ( 6 , 36 , 37 ) . The localization and dynamics of fluorescently tagged Dnm2 ( Dnm2 - GFP ) , Synj1 - 170 ( GFP - Synj1 ) , endophilin 2 ( Endo2 - GFP ) , and actin in cultured podocytes were examined by spinning disc confocal microscopy . As previously shown in fibroblasts ( 28 , 37 , 38 ) , dynamin selectively colocalized with clathrin at late - stage clathrin - coated pits , just prior to the disappearance of the clathrin signal due to membrane fission and movement of the vesicle away from the plane of imaging concomitant with uncoating ( Supple - mental Figure 6 , A and B , Figure 5C , and Supplemental Video 1 ) . Likewise , as in fibroblasts ( 28 ) , Synj1 - 170 was observed at all clathrin - coated pits regardless of maturation state ( Supplemen - tal Figure 6 , D – F , and Supplemental Video 2 ) , whereas endophilin appeared along with dynamin just before fission ( Synj1 - 170 is not dependent on endophilin for its recruitment , but contains the endophilin binding sites , consistent with a functional interaction of the 2 proteins at late - stage pits ; refs . 28 , 39 ) . As shown in Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 7A , robust colo - calization was observed between Dnm2 - GFP – positive spots and spots positive for the mCherry - tagged calponin homology domain of utrophin ( mCh - Utr ; a probe for F - actin in living cells ; ref . 40 ) , demonstrating a transient accumulation of actin , in parallel with dynamin , at the neck of endocytic clathrin pits prior to their fis - sion , as described previously ( 37 ) . mCh - Utr spots also overlapped with a subset of GFP - Synj1 spots ( Figure 5B ) , representative of late - stage pits ( Supplemental Figure 7B ) , and completely over - lapped with Endo2 - GFP spots , which also colocalized with mRFP - tagged clathrin ( mRFP - CLC ; Figure 5 , C and D , and Supplemen - tal Figure 7 , C and D ) . Thus , while the obligatory recruitment of actin at late - stage endocytic clathrin - coated pits and a coopera - tive role of dynamin and actin in fission is a matter of debate ( 38 , 41 , 42 ) , a link between actin and clathrin - mediated endocytosis clearly existed in podocytes ( Supplemental Video 3 ) . Importantly , Dnm2 - GFP , GFP - Synj1 , and Endo2 - GFP colocalized with F - actin at clathrin - coated pits , not on actin stress fibers ( Figure 5 , A – C ) , emphasizing the link between these 3 endocytic proteins and the endocytic function of actin . The relationship between endocytic clathrin - coated pits and actin in podocytes was further demonstrated by the massive accu - mulation of Arp2 / 3 at arrested clathrin - coated pits of cultured podocytes from pod - Dnm - DKO mice ( Figure 5 , E – G ) that were also positive for endophilin ( Supplemental Figure 6G ) , as shown previously in fibroblasts ( 6 ) . A less pronounced but significant accumulation of Arp2 / 3 was observed at endocytic clathrin spots of Synj1 KO podocytes ( Figure 5 , E – G ) , possibly reflecting a con - sequence of elevated PIP2 levels at these sites , as previously shown after perturbation of Synj1 function at synapses ( 21 ) . Dynamin , synaptojanin , and endophilin interactors play critical functions in podocyte foot processes . In light of the effect that the lack of dynamin , synaptojanin , and / or endophilin has on the glomerular filtration barrier , it is quite striking that other proteins that interacted with dynamin , synaptojanin , and endophilin ( Figure 5H ) , when lost , also result in proteinuria ( 43 – 45 ) , although their function at foot processes was not attributed to an endocytic function . One such protein is myo - sin 1E ( Myo1E ) , a monomeric myosin that binds both dyna - min and synaptojanin via a COOH - terminal SH3 domain ( 45 ) , and whose absence in mice and mutations in humans result in nephrotic syndrome ( 44 – 46 ) . When Myo1E was expressed along with either mRFP - CLC or mCh - Utr in podocytes , it accu - mulated at late - stage clathrin - coated pits , where it colocalized with the pool of F - actin present at these sites ( Figure 5 , I and J , Supplemental Figure 7 , E and F , and Supplemental Video 4 ) . CD2AP , whose functional impairment also results in nephrotic syndrome in both mice and humans ( 43 , 47 ) , is a major binding partner of endophilin ( 48 , 49 ) and interacts ( like its homolog CIN85 ) with dynamin and synaptojanin ( 50 , 51 ) both directly and indirectly through endophilin . Accordingly , GFP - tagged CD2AP ( CD2AP - GFP ) , when expressed in podocytes , was local - ized at late - stage clathrin - coated pits along with endophilin ( Figure 5K and Supplemental Figure 7G ) . Nephrotic syndrome is also produced by loss of Nck , an endocytic adaptor that binds to both dynamin and synaptojanin ( 52 , 53 ) . Finally , it has been recently shown that the mouse KO of PI3KC2 α , the gene encod - ing a class II PI3K that binds clathrin and participates in clath - rin - mediated endocytosis ( 28 ) , develops glomerulonephropathy with proteinuria and renal failure ( 54 ) . Endocytic defect in pod - Dnm - DKO and Synj1 KO podocytes . To deter - mine whether the protein network discussed above plays a role in mediating the internalization of key podocyte cargo proteins , we performed internalization assays in isolated podocytes of 2 mutant genotypes , Dnm1 ; Dnm2 DKO and Synj1 KO . We focused on nephrin as the cargo protein because endocytosis was previ - ously shown to play a role in nephrin regulation ( 55 ) . Nephrin is an integral membrane protein that participates in the formation of the slit diaphragm that connects adjacent foot processes ( 56 ) . Podocytes were transfected with a protein chimera comprising the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of nephrin and the Figure 5 Defects in actin regulation and endocytosis in pod - Dnm - DKO , Synj1 KO , and endophilin TKO podocytes .

Using an anti - CD8 antibody – based internalization assay , we found that the internalization of this probe was significantly delayed in pod - Dnm - DKO and Synj1 KO podocytes ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . Discussion Our present findings support an important role of dynamin in the maintenance of the permeability barrier of the kidney ( 5 ) . We further demonstrated that synaptojanin and endophilin , which are functional partners of dynamin in synaptic vesicle endocyto - sis at neuronal synapses , were critically implicated in the devel - opment of the permeability barrier of the kidney . Most likely , dynamin is also essential for the development of this barrier , but the early embryonic lethality of Dnm2 KO mice did not allow us to explore this possibility . In the genetic model used by us , the expression of Dnm1 and Dnm2 was suppressed after podocyte foot processes have already developed . In contrast , the Synj1 KO and endophilin TKO mice used for our investigations were con - stitutive KOs . Interestingly , these mice , although greatly neuro - logically impaired , were macroscopically normal at birth , which indicates that these 2 proteins are critically required only for the development of selected cell types . Dynamin , synaptojanin , and endophilin have well - established endocytic functions . Endocytosis may help control the steady - state level and turnover of cell surface molecules , which , via actions on signaling pathways , may affect foot process struc - ture . An effect mediated by defective endocytosis , however , does not rule out additional direct effects on actin . All these proteins have been linked to actin function and endocytosis , which are tightly interconnected with actin ( Figure 7 and refs . 6 , 13 , 37 , 38 , 42 ) . Interestingly , even at synapses , disruption of the function of dynamin , synaptojanin , and endophilin , as well as that of other endocytic proteins , was shown to not only impair endo - cytosis , but also affect the architecture of nerve terminals , which prompted Dickman et al . to suggest that “endocytosis plays a critical role in sculpting the structure of synapses , perhaps through the endocytosis of unknown regulatory signals that organize morphogenesis at synaptic terminals” ( 57 ) . In conclusion , our study pro - vides a striking demonstration of how a similar and evolutionary conserved endocytosis machin - ery , functionally linked to the actin cytoskeleton , has been used in different cellular contexts to control highly specialized physiological process , such as synaptic vesicle recycling and the forma - tion of the glomerular filtration barrier .

Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions , transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore ) , blocked with 5 % milk in TBST , and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in this buffer . After 3 washes with PBS , membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase – conjugated secondary antibodies , and signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( GE ) . Histology , immunohistochemistry , and immunofluorescence staining . Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine fol - lowed by perfusion fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde with or without glutaldehyde through the left ventricle . For histology , sections were sent to Yale Pathology Core Tissue Services for H & E , periodic acid - Schiff , and Masson’s trichrome staining as well as electron microscopy . For immunohistochemistry , kidney cryosections ( 4 μ m ) were subjected to antigen retrieval ( Retrievagen ; BD Biosciences ) , followed by blocking with 3 % BSA in PBS for 1 hour . Immunostaining was performed with pri - mary antibodies overnight at 4°C , followed by Alexa Fluor 488 – and / or Alexa Fluor 594 – conjugated secondary antibodies , washing , and mount - ing with Vectashield with DAPI mounting medium ( Vector Labs ) . Cul - tured cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature , washed with PBS , then incubated for 5 minutes in 0 . 1 % Tri - ton X - 100 in PBS , followed by blocking with 5 % BSA for 30 minutes . Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temper - ature , followed by the appropriate secondary antibody , and imaged using a Perkin Elmer Ultraview Vox spinning disc confocal microscope with either × 60 CFI PlanApo VC ( NA 1 . 4 ) or × 100 CFi PlanApo VC ( NA 1 . 4 ) objectives or a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope using a × 63 Plan Apo ( NA 1 . 4 ) oil immersion objective . We used NIH Image J software to analyze raw images and quantitate particles as previously described ( 28 ) . For measurement of foot processes / glomerular basement membrane , 4 random glomeruli capillary loops in 3 different animals for each condition were chosen , and glomerular basement membrane length was analyzed by Image J software followed by manually counting the number of foot processes for each loop . Nonradioactive phosphatidylinositol assay . To evaluate PIP2 levels , a nonradio - active phosphatidylinositol assay was used ( 63 ) . Briefly , 9 pairs of Synj1 KO and wild - type kidneys were snap - frozen in liquid N 2 , pulverized , and trans - ferred to a glass tube with 1 ml cold chloroform / MeOH / 10 N HCl ( 20 : 40 : 1 ) containing 2 mM AlCl 3 . Following homogenization , chloroform and water was added at a 1 : 2 ratio , the samples were centrifuged , and the lower phase was collected and dried under nitrogen . Phospholipids were deacylated with monomethylamine , resuspended in 0 . 5 ml water , and extracted twice with an equal volume n - butanol / petroleum ether / ethyl formate ( 20 : 4 : 1 ) to remove fatty acids . The deacylated lipids were recovered by addition of 0 . 5 ml water , vortexing , centrifugation , and collection of the aqueous phase . The butanol phase was re - extracted with 0 . 5 ml water . The second aqueous phase was combined with the first , and the pool was dried under vacuum and resuspended in water . The anionic glycerol head groups were then sepa - rated via anion exchange using a Dionex ICS - 3000 HPLC system . Live cell imaging and analysis . Live cell imaging were performed as described previously ( 28 ) . Briefly , GFP - , mRFP - , and / or mCherry - tagged proteins were coexpressed in primary podocytes by electroporation ( Amaxa nucleo - fector kit R ) . Transfected cells were seeded in glass - bottomed 35 - mm dish - es ( no . 1 . 5 thickness ; MatTek ) and imaged 24 hours later . Before imaging , medium was replaced with an imaging buffer ( containing 136 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] ) . Cells were imaged using a Perkin Elmer spinning confocal microscope each sample ( Bethyl Laboratories Inc . ) . Urine and plasma creatinine were measured in duplicate for each sample by the core facility of the George O’Brien Kidney Center at Yale University . Cell culture . For Synj1 KO , endophilin TKO , and littermate control mice , whole kidneys were isolated , minced with a razor , and digested with col - lagenase ( 5 mg / ml ) containing DNase ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ) for 1 hour at 37°C . The digested kidneys were filtered through a 100 - μ m ( Falcon ) cell strainer , plated on type 1 collagen - coated dishes , and cultured at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 U / ml penicillin / strep - tomycin , 10 mM HEPES , 1 mM sodium bicarbonate , and 1 mM sodium pyruvate . Subculture of primary podocytes was performed from the iso - lated kidney cells described above by trypsinization with 0 . 25 % trypsin / EDTA ( Invitrogen ) at culture day 3 , followed by sieving through a 40 - μ m cell strainer ( Falcon ) to isolate an enriched podocyte population as previ - ously described ( 62 ) . For pod - Dnm - DKO mice , glomeruli were isolated by Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) perfusion followed by podocyte isolation as pre - viously described ( 24 ) . Transfections were performed by electroporation using the Amaxa nucleofactor protocol for podocytes ( Lonza ) . Immunoblotting . Cells or kidney homogenates were lysed with ice - cold buffer ( for Dnm1 , Dnm2 , or Synj1 , 20 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 50 mM NaF ; or 10 m M Figure 7 Synaptojanin , dynamin , and endophilin within podocyte foot processes .

Silvia Giovedi’s present address is : Department of Experimental Medicine , University of Genova , Genova , Italy . ( Perkin Elmer ) as previously described ( 6 ) . NIH Image J software was used to analyze images , to generate intensity plots of areas of interest , and to quantitate particles . We calculated the lifetimes of fluorescently tagged proteins by manual assessment of fluorescent spots from images acquired during 3 separate experiments ( 29 ) . Colocalization between 2 proteins was determined by randomly selecting 20 spots in the green channel , followed by manually scoring for colocalization in the red channel . All data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student’s t test . CD8 - nephrin chimera endocytosis assay . For internalization studies , the cells expressing CD8 – rat nephrin – Flag were washed with cold PBS , and labeled for 1 hour at 4°C with mouse anti - CD8 antibody in serum free RPMI . Unbound antibody was removed by 3 washes with cold PBS prior to incubating the cells at 37°C in prewarmed complete RPMI . After inter - nalization of bound label for varying time intervals , the cells were washed with PBS , and surface - retained mouse anti - CD8 antibody was labeled at 4°C for 40 minutes with Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated anti - mouse antibody in serum - free RPMI medium , followed by extensive washing with cold PBS and fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde . The cells were then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and subsequently blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS , and mouse anti - CD8 antibody was detected with Alexa Fluor 594 anti - mouse antibody . The cells were washed 3 times with PBS , followed by mounting with Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories ) . Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope using a × 63 Plan Ao ( NA 1 . 4 ) oil immersion objective . To quantify CD8 - nephrin endocytosis , fluores - cence intensities of cell surface – retained nephrin ( Alexa Fluor 488 signal originating from the cell surface ) and internalized nephrin ( Alexa Fluor 594 signal from the cell interior ) were measured with NIH Image J soft - ware by examining 20 cells per experiment ( n = 3 ) from each indicated time point . We defined the endocytosed nephrin by subtracting the Alexa Fluor 488 image from the Alexa Fluor 594 image and normalizing to surface - derived fluorescence intensity ( [ Alexa Fluor 594 – Alexa Fluor 488 ] / Alexa Fluor 488 ) . Anti - CD8 antibody staining on untransfected cells was evalu - ated as a negative control and found to be minimal .
