WASP family proteins , more than Arp2 / 3 activators Joe J . Tyler , Ellen G . Allwood and Kathryn R .

Ayscough ( k . ayscough @ sheffield . ac . uk ) Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family proteins have been extensively charac - terized as factors that promote the nucleation of actin through the activation of the protein complex Arp2 / 3 . While yeast mostly have a single member of the family , mamma - lian cells have at least six different members , often with multiple isoforms . Members of the family are characterized by a common structure . Their N - termini are varied and are considered to confer spatial and temporal regulation of Arp2 / 3 - activating activity , whereas their C - terminal half contains a polyproline - rich region , one or more WASP homology - 2 ( WH2 ) actin - binding domains and motifs that bind directly to Arp2 / 3 . Recent studies , however , indicate that the yeast WASP homologue Las17 is able to nucleate actin independently of Arp2 / 3 through the function of novel G - actin - binding activities in its polyproline region . This allows Las17 to generate the mother ﬁ laments that are needed for subsequent Arp2 / 3 recruitment and activation during the actin polymerization that drives endocytic invagination in yeast . In this review , we consider how motifs within the polyproline region of Las17 support nucleation of actin ﬁ laments , and whether similar mechanisms might exist among other family members . Background A fundamental understanding of how a cell responds to its environment , in order to drive changes in cell physiology , is critical if we are to make relevant and appropriate interventions in the context of disease states . Many years of research have demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton is a focal point of regulation ; however , there are still large gaps in our understanding of mechanisms governing de novo actin ﬁ lament formation and regulation in the context of membranes . The initial stage of ﬁ lament formation , the assembly of a nucleus of 3 – 4 actin monomers , is ener - getically unfavourable , highly concentration dependent . In the absence of nucleation , promotion factors occur only slowly . However , following nucleation , growth of the polymer proceeds rapidly [ 1 – 3 ] . There are two well - characterized actin nucleation machineries in eukaryotes . Arp2 / 3 , which is a seven - subunit complex , proposed to generate a branched cortical actin network in cells , and formins that generate unbranched ﬁ laments that are often bundled together [ 1 , 2 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex does not nucleate actin de novo and requires both a nucleation promotion factor ( NPF ) and an existing ﬁ la - ment from which to form a branch [ 4 ] . While many proteins have been described to act as NPFs for Arp2 / 3 , the most studied group of these proteins is the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family [ 5 ] . Members of this protein family are found across eukaryotic organisms and in all cases are considered to function with Arp2 / 3 to nucleate actin ﬁ laments [ 6 ] . The critical part of these proteins to activate Arp2 / 3 is the C - terminal region , whereas the N - terminal parts are relatively diverse and considered to facilitate spatio - temporal regulation of the individual family members [ 6 ] . With their multidomain protein structures , the WASP family of proteins is ideally built for integrating diverse upstream signals to drive appropriate changes in the actin cytoskeleton [ 6 – 8 ] . Figure 1 illustrates many best - characterized mammalian WASP family members and the yeast homologue Las17 . Based on evidence from many studies , it is clear that Arp2 / 3 ’ s function is closely linked with an ability to bind to the C - terminal acidic region of WASP family proteins and to ‘ receive ’ a monomer bound by the actin - binding motif , WASP homology - 2 ( WH2 ) . This monomer is proposed to combine with the actin - related moieties , Arp2 and Arp3 , to mimic a trimer , which can then act as a nucleus for polymerization , as Arp2 / 3 is effectively mimicking an actin dimer that then combines with a Version of Record published : 19 October 2016 Received : 17 June 2016 Revised : 14 July 2016 Accepted : 21 July 2016 © 2016 The Author ( s ) .

This nucleus can then undergo rapid actin polymerization . Indeed , this model of monomer delivery to Arp2 / 3 to create an actin nucleus is at the heart of our current mechanistic understanding of Arp2 / 3 - based actin nucleation . A question that remains , however , is the nature of the ﬁ laments that Arp2 / 3 must bind in order to generate the ‘ branch ’ of polymerized actin . The nature of these ‘ mother ’ or nascent ’ ﬁ laments is only just beginning to be addressed . One suggestion is that Arp2 / 3 will bind to existing actin ﬁ laments that are found in the dense cortical actin mesh in many mammalian cells . One limitation of this model is that some membrane sites where actin is known to be nucleated , such as endocytic sites in yeast and endosomes in mammalian cells , do not appear to be surrounded by actin meshworks , so the origin of pre - existing ﬁ laments for Arp2 / 3 recruitment is not clear . A proposal from work in the ﬁ ssion yeast is that the actin ﬁ lament - depolymerizing and - severing protein co ﬁ lin can function to generate short ﬁ laments and that these can be recruited by the membrane - tethered protein End4 / Sla2 at endocytic sites [ 11 ] . Currently , it is not known how the ﬁ laments remain assembled during this movement and capture mechanism . Many pieces of evidence accumulated over the last decade have begun to point to the importance of the polyproline - rich ( PPR ) region of WASP proteins , not only just as a scaffold region for binding SH3 domain proteins but also as a domain capable of functioning in the regulation of actin dynamics in its own right . One of the earlier pieces of evidence derives from a set of studies comparing the effect of WCA domains from WASP and Scar / Wave with constructs carrying the PPR + WCA and the full - length proteins in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( see Figure 1 for domain nomenclature ) . In both cases , the addition of PPR to WCA reduced the lag phase , as de ﬁ ned by the time taken before an increase in pyrene ﬂ uorescence ( indicative of ﬁ lament formation ) could be detected [ 12 ] . Importantly , this enhancement of ﬁ lament elongation can be viewed as an activity inherent to the PPR region as additional proteins were not used in these assays . Work from the Goode lab added further evidence through an analysis of yeast Las17 . In the present study , the effect of full - length Las17 or WCA alone on actin polymerization was compared and , somewhat surprisingly , only the full - length protein nucleated actin in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , while the WCA domain contributed to an increase in ﬁ lament elongation [ 13 ] . Three more recent studies described below have contributed to a greater understanding of the PPR region in the yeast WASP homologue and underpin the importance of this region in the function of this key actin regulator . Arp2 / 3 - independent actin nucleation by yeast Las17 / WASP polyproline region Endocytosis in budding yeast requires actin to be polymerized at speci ﬁ c plasma membrane sites . Force generated through actin polymerization , and by bundling actin ﬁ laments together , is necessary to drive the required Figure 1 . Schematic diagram showing domains of WASP family proteins . N - terminal domains depicted are in pale blue — WASP homology 1 ( WH1 ) ; WAVE homology domain ( WHD ) ; WASH homology domain ( WAHD ) and the WHAMM membrane interaction domain ( WM ) or N - terminal domain ( N ) . Other domains are : B , basic region ; GBD , GTPase - binding domain ; CC , coiled coil region ; P , proline - rich domain ; W , the WASP homology - 2 ( WH2 ) domain ; C , the connecting or central domain ; A , acidic domain . W , C and A together are referred to as the WCA domain . In general , the N - terminal domains are thought to confer spatiotemporal regulation on the protein , while the WCA regions at the C - terminal are required for activation of Arp2 / 3 . 1340 © 2016 The Author ( s ) .

Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2016 ) 44 1339 – 1345 DOI : 10 . 1042 / BST20160176 inward membrane invagination against the outward pressure due to cell turgor [ 14 ] . A similar requirement for actin during endocytosis is found in mammalian cells when the plasma membrane is under tension [ 15 ] . Las17 is recruited to endocytic sites following assembly of various coat complexes and cargo recruitment . Once recruited , there is a highly reproducible sequence of assembly and disassembly events at the sites driving mem - brane invagination and culminating in scission of a vesicle [ 16 , 17 ] . Unlike mammalian cells , there is not an underlying cortex of actin and it is considered that actin ﬁ laments is must be generated de novo at new sites of endocytosis . Las17 is the primary activator of Arp2 / 3 at yeast endocytic sites [ 18 ] . As shown in Figure 1 , Las17 has a domain structure broadly similar to those of other WASP family proteins . In particular , it has a C - terminal WCA domain comprising a G - actin - binding WH2 domain and a connecting + acidic ( CA ) domain that inter - acts with Arp2 / 3 . In this way , it can supply monomeric actin to ﬁ laments nucleated by Arp2 / 3 . It was therefore a surprise when deletion of just the acidic domain or of the entire WCA domain of Las17 caused only rather mild phenotypes in growth and endocytosis [ 19 , 20 ] . This was in contrast with the complete loss of Las17 that caused a severe growth defect , and endocytosis was barely detectable [ 21 ] . These experiments suggested that other regions of Las17 were critical for its cellular function . The in vitro work from the Goode lab ( above ) had also indicated that regions upstream from the WCA region were important for an actin nucleation event . Investigations by our laboratory then revealed that the polyproline region itself is able to bind to actin and that , in fact , this region alone is able to nucleate actin ﬁ laments de novo in the absence of Arp2 / 3 [ 22 ] . This was unexpected as the region contained no similarity to known actin - binding regions , rather there were many tracts of ﬁ ve proline residues . Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays , the importance of speci ﬁ c proline residues was demonstrated and a model was proposed suggesting that the proline region contained multiple weak sites of actin binding [ 22 ] . This property would serve to increase the local concentration of actin , thus promoting conditions for nucleation . Thus , while the nucleation was not as strong as observed with Arp2 / 3 , it could serve to generate de novo ﬁ laments which themselves could drive recruitment of Arp2 / 3 for a more substantial burst of nucleation to drive the invagination of membrane . Figure 2 . Model showing possible involvement of the PPR of Las17 in actin polymerization . ( A ) In the absence of Arp2 / 3 , Las17 binds and nucleates actin via regions of the PPR region containing paired basic residues . The remainder of the PPR lies alongside the newly formed ﬁ lament and promotes elongation of the ﬁ lament via weak actin binding through the repeated proline tracts . The Las17 WH2 has a high af ﬁ nity for actin monomers and can increase their local concentration when this would otherwise become limiting for PPR - mediated ﬁ lament elongation . ( B ) In the presence of Arp2 / 3 , a Las17 – Arp2 / 3 complex is formed which binds to a mother ﬁ lament and initiates branch formation . Branch elongation is enhanced by the PPR domain .

[ 23 ] demonstrated the importance of arginine residue pairs ( RR349 , 350 ; RR382 , 383 ) in Las17 that facilitated G - actin binding within the PPR region . Their study focussed on the role of these residues in the context of Arp2 / 3 and clearly highlighted the importance of the RR pairs for G - actin binding and for rapid polymerization by Arp2 / 3 . The importance of the polyproline region of Las17 for its primary function was also demonstrated in a study from Lewellyn et al . [ 24 ] . In the present study , chimeric proteins were made between Las17 and one of the yeast myosin 1 proteins that also function in the endocytic process . Intriguingly , the critical domains required to support endocytic invagination were the myosin motor domain , a membrane - binding domain ( in this case , TH1 from the myosin ) and the polyproline region ( residues 324 – 426 ) . Again , the present study shifts the iden - tity for the essential Las17 functions away from the WCA domain onto the polyproline region and would therefore potentially indicate that Arp2 / 3 activation is a secondary or redundant function of Las17 in the endocytic process . Given that three other proteins at endocytic sites bind to both Las17 and Arp2 / 3 ( Myo3 , Myo5 and Abp1 ) , once actin ﬁ laments are generated , there are multiple other proteins present that can ful ﬁ l the role of Arp2 / 3 recruitment [ 19 , 20 ] . A diagram outlining our model for the nucleation and elongation of ﬁ laments de novo by Las17 is depicted in Figure 2 . Arp2 / 3 - independent actin nucleation by other WASP family proteins Increased local concentration of actin monomers is known to favour ﬁ lament nucleation . In Las17 , we propose that binding of monomers by the PPR domain allows nucleation to proceed in the absence of Arp2 / 3 . A signi ﬁ - cant question then is whether other WASP family proteins can use similar mechanisms to also generate ﬁ laments de novo . It is notable that in contrast with Saccharomyces cerevisiae that has only one WASP family protein with mul - tiple actin - binding sites , mammalian cells have several different WASP family proteins , many of which are expressed in different tissues or active on different membrane compartments [ 6 , 25 ] . As such , they may be adapted to their different situations and have lost functions that are not required in their speci ﬁ c role . However , given that the large majority of WASP family proteins are considered to activate Arp2 / 3 , and that Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity requires it to bind a mother ﬁ lament , there is always a need for mother ﬁ laments to be generated , and the ability of WASP family proteins to generate such ﬁ laments would facilitate close coupling of these two activities . Four clear routes can be readily identi ﬁ ed for WASP family proteins to increase local actin monomer concen - tration : ( 1 ) tandem WH2 domains as in N - WASP and JMY ; ( 2 ) dimerization as detected for N - WASP ; ( 3 ) binding of other G - actin - binding proteins such as WIP or pro ﬁ lin and ( 4 ) paired basic residue actin binding as in Las17 . JMY is found in the nucleus of numerous cell types , but in more motile cells it is often found at the leading edge [ 26 , 27 ] . More recently , JMY and the related protein WHAMM have both been found to associate with the autophagosome . At this site , WHAMM has been demonstrated to participate in autophagosome biogenesis [ 28 ] , whereas JMY has been proposed to link actin nucleation to autophagosome maturation [ 29 ] . Similar to Las17 , JMY can both activate the Arp2 / 3 complex and nucleate actin ﬁ lament formation de novo [ 26 , 27 ] . In the absence of Arp2 / 3 , actin nucleation can be facilitated via three tandem WH2 domains in a similar manner to that observed for the protein Spire , presumably by increasing local actin monomer concentration [ 30 – 33 ] . Multimerization has been considered to be relevant for WASP family protein involvement in nucleation from experiments that demonstrated that GST - tagged WCA domains , which dimerize through their GST moi - eties , have higher activity in polymerization assays with actin and Arp2 / 3 than their His - tagged counterparts [ 34 ] . One route for dimerization is through the presence of more than one binding site for WCA domains on the Arp2 / 3 complex , though clearly this route is synonymous with Arp2 / 3 activation [ 35 , 36 ] . A second route for multimerization , however , relies on the presence of the PPR domain and is facilitated through binding of the WASP family protein by a binding partner with multiple SH3 domains . Such a mechanism has been detected with Nck binding to N - WASP [ 34 ] . Again , these routes lead to the presence of multiple WH2 domains in a highly localized region and can therefore contribute to increased local concentration of G - actin . Different conformational orientations of WH2 domains facilitated by intramolecular interactions or multimerization may allow effective regulation of nucleation . 1342 © 2016 The Author ( s ) .

Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2016 ) 44 1339 – 1345 DOI : 10 . 1042 / BST20160176 In addition to binding of proteins to bring about multimerization , binding partners often carry additional actin - binding sites . The best characterized of these proteins is WIP ( verprolin in S . cerevisiae ) , which binds to the N - terminal region of several WASP family proteins and itself has a WH2 domain as well as PPR regions [ 37 – 39 ] . Furthermore , several groups of proteins bind to the PPR region and may directly or indirectly in ﬂ u - ence the function of this region with regard to actin dynamics . These include proteins with SH3 domains ( binding PXXP motifs ) , EVH domains ( binding FPPPP in VASP ) and WW domains ( binding PPXY ) [ 40 – 42 ] . As well as Nck mentioned above which facilitates N - WASP dimerization , many of these WASP family - binding proteins also bind to F - actin or other actin regulatory proteins . Another protein that has an impact on the activity of some WASP family proteins through binding in the PPR region is the G - actin - binding protein pro ﬁ lin . In the case of Las17 , neither we , nor others , have observed an impact of pro ﬁ lin on Las17 function and we consider it most likely that this could be due to the fact that the longest proline tract in the Las17 PPR region is only ﬁ ve residues . Tracts of eight or more prolines , which are found in several WASP family proteins , are considered more likely to bind pro ﬁ lin , whereas for those with an intermediate length of proline tract this aspect of activation is relatively unclear , especially within a cellular context [ 43 – 45 ] . In addition to yeast Las17 , the Drosophila protein WHAMY is a WASP family protein capable of nucleating actin ﬁ laments independently of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 46 ] . It differs from Las17 and JMY , however , in that it has lost the ability to activate Arp2 / 3 at all . Instead , it appears to work in tandem with WASP throughout many stages of Drosophila development [ 46 ] . The interaction of WHAMY and WASP enhances both the Arp2 / 3 - independent activity of WHAMY and the Arp2 / 3 - dependent activity of WASP . Intriguingly , like Las17 , WHAMY contains several basic residue pairs within its PPR domain , raising the possibility that its nucleating function might involve a similar mechanism to that we have suggested for Las17 . Finally , WASP itself has been shown to contain a very weak Arp2 / 3 - independent actin - nucleating activity within its PPR region [ 22 ] . This protein contains a single RR pair just upstream of one of its proline tracts , though the importance of these resi - dues has not yet been reported . Emerging from these wide - ranging observations is the idea that many WASP family proteins are likely to have functionality , either inherent or through interaction with other proteins , to support de novo actin nucle - ation independently of Arp2 / 3 . However , these activities in general appear to be functionally coupled to the subsequent recruitment and activation of Arp2 / 3 itself . Important questions for the future will focus on under - standing the role of the PPR domain as a region to either facilitate nucleation or elongation of actin ﬁ laments ; the regulatory links between Arp2 / 3 - independent and - dependent nucleation processes ; the extent of nucleation required to generate mother ﬁ laments within speci ﬁ c cell settings for Arp2 / 3 recruitment and de ﬁ ning the conformational arrangements of monomers bound to WASP family proteins to determine how distinct organizations favour nucleation or sequestration of actin .
