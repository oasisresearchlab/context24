To examine mediators of this effect , 95 Chinese and US 5 - year - olds completed a test of overall symbolic arithmetic , an IQ subtest , and three tests each of symbolic and non - symbolic numerical magnitude knowledge ( magnitude comparison , approximate addi - tion , and number - line estimation ) . Overall Chinese children performed better in symbolic arithmetic than US children , and all measures of IQ and number knowledge predicted over - all symbolic arithmetic . Chinese children were more accurate than US peers in symbolic numerical magnitude comparison , symbolic approximate addition , and both symbolic and non - symbolic number - line estimation ; Chinese and U . S . children did not differ in IQ and non - symbolic magnitude comparison and approximate addition . A substantial amount of the nationality difference in overall symbolic arithmetic was mediated by performance on the symbolic and number - line tests . Introduction Mathematics proficiency differs greatly among nations [ 1 – 3 ] , with a large advantage for East Asian over US students [ 4 ] . This “learning gap” appears before formal schooling , and it grows with each year [ 5 ] . Many differences in educational inputs exist that might explain the advantage of East Asian children . These differences include a transparent base - 10 naming system for numbers [ 6 ] , bet - ter quality math instruction in East Asian schools [ 7 , 8 ] , more time spent on math instruction [ 4 ] , greater math knowledge of East Asian teachers [ 9 ] , and more positive attitudes about math among East Asian students and parents [ 4 , 10 ] . What remains unclear , however , is how these differences in environmental and educational inputs ( e . g . , language , instruction methods , time on task , teacher quality , and attitudes ) lead to differences in outputs ( e . g . , addition skill ) . One possibility is that these national differences contribute directly to differences in math proficiency ; this possibility appears to be the tacit assumption of most educational research . Another possibility is that national differences PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 1 / 17 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : OpferJE , Kim D , FazioLK , ZhouX , Siegler RS ( 2021 ) Cognitivemediatorsof US—China differences in early symbolic arithmetic .

Funding : Partial fundingof the research was provided by a grantto JO from the Institute of EducationSciences ( R305A160295 ) and by a grant to the Siegler Centerfor Innovative Learning from the Advanced Innovation Centerfor Future Education , Beijing NormalUniversity , Beijing , China . The funders had no role in studydesign , contribute mostly indirectly , by means of producing math - related cognitive gains , such as in general intelligence or basic numeracy . Our ignorance of the second possibility may put us in a situation like that of 19th century physicians who treated scurvy with citrus fruits but had not yet discovered the role of ascorbic acid . We know that the input matters but not how . This is a potentially dangerous situation . Knowing only that citrus fruits were important , physicians came to treat scurvy by boiling lime juice ( which destroys ascorbic acid ) , were unable to explain why some fruits were ineffec - tive at treating scurvy , overlooked non - obvious sources of ascorbic acid ( such as fresh meat ) , and ultimately abandoned the treatment of scurvy with citrus fruits [ 11 ] . What doctors needed to identify was the mediator by which citrus fruits exercised their effects . Without identifying mediators between educational inputs and student math proficiency , we are likely to make mistakes similar to those of 19 th century physicians . Similar to treating scurvy with boiled lime juice , less successful schools might imitate the practices of more suc - cessful ones without achieving similar results , due to a lack of understanding of the processes that produced the superior results . In contrast , identifying factors that mediate increases in math proficiency offers a promising path forward . Such knowledge could indicate how suc - cessful math outcomes can be achieved even without ( for example ) Chinese number naming , Chinese cultural attitudes toward mathematics , Chinese teachers’ deep understanding of the math being taught , and so on . In this study , we explore how cognitive abilities , especially numerical magnitude knowl - edge , mediate nation effects on math performance , in particular symbolic arithmetic . A model for this approach comes from research on the effects of SES ( socioeconomic status ) on differences in math proficiency . It has long been known that children in higher - income fami - lies are more proficient in mathematics than children in lower - income ones [ 12 ] , but the mechanism has been unclear . In what turned out to be crucial , children from higher - income families have been shown to have better numerical magnitude knowledge [ 13 ] . The relation proved to be causal as well as correlational . When programs were implemented to promote numerical magnitude knowledge in low - income children , the advantage for children from high - income children shrank [ 14 ] or disappeared [ 15 ] . Thus , by discovering important cog - nitive differences between high and low SES families—and targeting them for intervention— researchers were able to close an important learning gap . No previous study , however , has examined cognitive mechanisms through which cross - national differences lead to differences in math achievement . Numerical magnitude knowledge as a potential mediator of nation effects As with the gap between children in high and low SES families , the gap between East Asian and US children might emerge through activities affecting quality of numerical magnitude knowledge [ 16 ] . In this view , practices that improve the abilities to compare numerical magni - tudes , to add them approximately , and to order them on a linearly - increasing “mental number line” might be key factors in producing early symbolic arithmetic . In previous studies , many measures of numerical magnitude knowledge have been shown to correlate with math achievement . Accuracy in identifying the more numerous of two sets of objects predicts math achievement test scores from preschool to adulthood [ 17 – 19 ] . Ability to find the numerically greater of two Arabic numerals or number words even more strongly pre - dicts arithmetic proficiency [ 20 , 21 ] . Accurately estimating the location on a number - line of Arabic numerals or the numbers of object in arrays also positively predicts math skills [ 22 ] , with the predictive power again being greater for symbolic than non - symbolic number - line PLOS ONE Cognitivemediatorsof US and Chinadifferences in math PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 2 / 17 data collectionand analysis , decisionto publish , or preparationof the manuscript .

All of these relations hold after statistically controlling for relevant variables , including IQ , reading comprehension , and SES [ 20 , 22 ] . The same tests of numerical magnitude knowledge often show an advantage for East Asian children relative to Western peers . Chinese children’s accuracy in numerical magnitude com - parison [ 23 ] and number line estimation [ 24 ] exceeds that of Western age peers . Chinese chil - dren also show the same logarithmic - to - linear shift in number - line estimation as their Western peers , but they typically generate linear estimation patterns at younger ages [ 24 , 25 ] . Current study The literature reviewed above suggests a simple model in which the quality of numerical mag - nitude knowledge mediates the effect of nationality on symbolic arithmetic ( Fig 1 ) . The model predicts : ( 1 ) American children will attain lower arithmetic scores than their East Asian peers , ( 2 ) numerical magnitude knowledge will be associated with better symbolic arithmetic , ( 3 ) American children will demonstrate less numerical magnitude knowledge than their East Asian peers , and ( 4 ) the effect of nation on symbolic arithmetic scores and errors will be medi - ated by numerical magnitude knowledge . The current study was designed to test all four pre - dictions . We also examined whether national differences in magnitude knowledge are limited to symbolic numbers ( which must be learned through cultural experiences ) or extend to non - symbolic numerosity ( which can be perceived fairly accurately by human infants and non - human animals ) . Method Participants Participants were 95 kindergartners recruited at the same time of year from four schools in Beijing , China and in Columbus , OH serving predominantly middle SES populations . No dif - ferences were present in means or variability of ages of participants in the United States ( n = 41 ; M = 5 . 46 years , SD = 0 . 22 ; 46 % female and 54 % male ; 78 % White , 10 % Black , and 7 % Asian , 5 % biracial ) and China ( n = 54 ; M = 5 . 52 years , SD = 0 . 23 ; 54 % female and 46 % male ; 100 % Asian ) . A power analysis revealed that this sample size was sufficient to detect an effect size of 0 . 50 ( Cohen’s d , [ 26 ] ) with power 0 . 80 for national differences in a t - test . Power analyses using the Sobel test also indicated that the sample size has adequate power for simple and mul - tiple mediations analyses ( power > . 92 for simple mediation and power > . 91 for multiple medi - ation analyses ) [ 27 – 29 ] . Informed written consent was obtained from all participants’ parents or legal guardians . Participants were given a set of tasks , whose materials and procedure were Fig 1 . Mediation model .

Tasks Symbolic arithmetic assessment . The symbolic arithmetic test was a speeded paper - and - pencil addition test based on Geary et al . [ 5 ] . The test comprised 50 items , ranging from 1 + 1 to 5 + 5 , with each problem given twice . Children were allowed 1 min to solve as many problems as possible . The reliability of this test , assessed in terms of Cronbach’s alpha , was very high ( . 95 ) . Coding . The coding task was based on that used by Stevenson et al . [ 30 ] and is similar to that found in intelligence tests given to children and adults . The code comprised nine paired symbols . One symbol was always a simple figure , such as V or t , and the other symbol was always a numeral ( i . e . , 1 – 9 ) . After the child was guided through seven practice items of the code , the child was given 2 minutes to complete as many of the 133 test items as possible . One of the non - numeric symbols was presented on each trial ; the child was to write the associated numeral below it . Non - symbolic number comparison . The non - symbolic magnitude comparison task was administered using free software downloaded from http : / / www . panamath . org ; it was similar to the comparison task in Halberda et al . [ 31 ] ( Fig 2 ) . On each trial , yellow and blue dots were presented on the left and right side of screen , respectively , for 2000ms , followed by a backward mask displayed for 200ms . Children were then asked to choose which side had more dots as quickly and accurately as possible . There were four ratio bins ( 1 . 22 – 1 . 41 , 1 . 41 – 1 . 63 , 1 . 70 – 1 . 96 , and 2 . 63 – 3 . 04 ) , 14 trials in each bin , resulting in 56 trials . Ratios were defined as the larger number divided by the smaller number . For example , for a comparison between 17 yellow and 21 blue dots , the ratio was 1 . 24 , whereas for a comparison between 8 yellow and 22 blue dots , the ratio was 2 . 75 . The array on each side of the screen included 4 to 30 dots . Dot size was con - trolled on half of the trials , and total area was controlled on the other half . Therefore , children needed to base their responses on the number of dots , not on the size or the total area of dots , to respond consistently correctly . There were 2 practice trials prior to the task . The reliability of the task , based on Cronbach’s alpha , was . 88 . Non - symbolic approximate addition . The non - symbolic approximate addition task was based on Barth et al . [ 32 ] ( Fig 2 ) . Children were required to add two dot arrays and compare the sum of dots to a third dot array . On each trial , two arrays of yellow dots appeared and then moved behind the left side of a screen . This was followed by an array of blue dots that appeared on the right side of a screen . Children were asked to judge whether yellow or blue dots were more numerous . Each array had 4 to 30 dots . To prevent counting , total display time was brief , 2500ms . Stimuli were generated from three ratio bins ( 1 . 22 – 1 . 41 , 1 . 41 – 1 . 63 , and 1 . 70 – 1 . 93 ) . Fig 2 . Numerical magnitude tasks .

On half of the trials , the sum of the addends was larger than the comparison . The total area was negatively correlated with the number of dots on half of the trials ; it was positively correlated with number on the other half . Cronbach’s alpha was . 84 . Non - symbolic number - line estimation . This task paralleled the number - line estimation task with Arabic numerals used in Kim and Opfer [ 33 ] ( Fig 2 ) . Children were presented a number - line with a box of 30 dots on the right end and an empty box of dots on the left end . The endpoints were labeled as “a lot of dots” and “no dots” . The 20 arrays that children esti - mated had 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 27 , 28 , or 29 dots ) , which matched the numbers in the symbolic number - line task . Each dot array was presented above the number - line for 2000ms . On half of the trials , the size ( area ) of individual dots was held constant , with the cumulative area of dots increasing with number ; on the other half of the tri - als , the cumulative area of dots was held constant , with the size of individual dots decreasing with number . These controls were designed to assess whether children based their responses on area instead of number . Children were told to focus on the number of dots rather than their sizes , and were asked to mouse - click the location of the number of dots on the number - line . Cronbach’s alpha was . 73 . Symbolic number comparison . In this task , children judged the relative magnitudes of two Arabic numerals . The numbers ranged from 4 to 30 and matched those in the non - sym - bolic magnitude comparison task ( Fig 2 ) . Two numerals were presented on the screen for 2000ms ; they then were covered with a mask for 200ms . There were 58 trials : 2 practice trials and then 14 trials randomly sampled from each of 4 ratio bins : 1 . 22 – 1 . 41 , 1 . 41 – 1 . 63 , 1 . 70 – 1 . 96 , and 2 . 63 – 3 . 04 . As in the non - symbolic number comparison task , the instructions emphasized the importance of both speed and accuracy . Cronbach’s alpha was . 90 . Symbolic approximate addition . The symbolic approximate addition task was identical to the non - symbolic approximate addition task except that stimuli were Arabic numerals ( Fig 2 ) . On each trial , children saw a computer - animated event , narrated by a researcher , in which a number appeared and moved behind a screen . After viewing two numerals ( e . g . , 9 and 12 ) move sequentially behind the screen , children saw a third numeral ( e . g . , 25 ) and judged whether the sum of the first two numbers or the third number was greater . Presenta - tion time was equal to that on the non - symbolic task ( 2500ms ) , making it unlikely that the kindergartners could enumerate and add these numbers quickly enough to obtain exact sums . ( As we will see , Chinese kindergartners required a mean of 12s to solve easier arithme - tic problems exactly . ) Across trials , the sum and comparison arrays differed by varying ratios ( 1 . 22 – 1 . 41 , 1 . 41 – 1 . 63 , and 1 . 70 – 1 . 93 ) ; each was larger on half the trials . On the 24 test prob - lems , the sum of the addends ranged from 4 to 30 , as did the comparison numbers . Cron - bach’s alpha was . 85 . Symbolic number - line estimation . This task was identical to the non - symbolic number - line estimation task except that Arabic numerals were substituted for dot arrays ( Fig 2 ) . For example , each number - line was flanked by the numbers “0” and “30” at each end . Children were asked to mouse - click a place where a given number belonged . The reliability of the task based on Cronbach’s alpha was . 86 . Procedure The experimental tasks were administered in a quiet space in schools over three sessions . Tasks and items within tasks were given in random order . Each session took less than 15 min , and children were tested individually .

In the first section , " Nationality effect on early symbolic arithmetic , " we estimate the total effect of nationality on children’s arithmetic proficiency ( Path C ) . This effect ( c ) is the sum of the direct effect ( c’ ) of nationality on arithmetic scores ( controlling for mediating variables ) and the indirect effect ( ab ) of nationality through mediating variables . Analyses in the next section , " Potential media - tors of nationality effects on early symbolic arithmetic " separate direct from indirect effects . These analyses test the effect of nationality on each potential mediator ( Path A ) , of each poten - tial mediator on arithmetic proficiency ( Path B ) , and how much of the full effect of nationality on symbolic arithmetic is explained by mediation via each potential mediator . Finally , in the last section , " Cognitive mechanisms underlying nationality effects on early symbolic arithme - tic , " we conduct a multiple mediation analysis to examine how much of the nationality effect on arithmetic proficiency occurs through the effect of numerical magnitude and which other cognitive mechanisms result in cross - national differences in symbolic arithmetic . Nationality effect on early symbolic arithmetic As shown in Fig 3A , accuracy on the standardized arithmetic test differed by nationality : Chi - nese kindergartners ( M = 5 . 02 , SD = 4 . 20 ) provided more correct answers than US kindergart - ners ( M = 3 . 17 , SD = 2 . 87 ) , t ( 93 ) = 2 . 42 , p < . 05 , d = . 50 , and US children ( M = 1 . 61 , SD = 3 . 20 ) provided more incorrect answers than Chinese children ( M = . 50 , SD = . 84 ) , t ( 93 ) = - 2 . 44 , p < . 05 , d = . 51 . The arithmetic scores , the difference between the number of correct and incorrect responses , were roughly three times as high in Chinese kindergartners ( M = 4 . 52 , Fig 3 .

For each boxplot , the central mark represents the median , the hinges are the first and third quartiles ( i . e . , the 25 th and 75 th percentiles ) , and the whiskers extend from the hinges to the smallest or largest values that are within 1 . 5 × interquartile range ( IQR ) from hinges—i . e . , 1 st quartile - 1 . 5 × IQR to 3 rd quartile + 1 . 5 × IQR .

Finally , on trials where children erred , the difference between the incorrect response that was advanced and the correct answer measured by the percent absolute error ( PAE = 100 × | response - correct answer | / correct answer ) was smaller among Chinese children ( M = 2 . 95 , SD = 6 . 05 ) than US peers , ( M = 16 . 42 , SD = 23 . 86 ) , t ( 88 ) = - 3 . 97 , p < . 001 , d = . 85 . Thus , com - pared to Chinese kindergartners , US kindergartners appeared less likely to provide correct arithmetic facts , more likely to answer incorrectly , and more likely to make large errors . To ensure that the national differences in symbolic arithmetic were not driven by outliers , we excluded data that were 3 standard deviations ( SD ) below or above the mean for each arith - metic measure . This led to exclusion of 3 Chinese children for the number of correct answers , 2 US children for the number of incorrect answers , 1 Chinese and 1 US children for arithmetic score , and 3 US children for arithmetic PAEs . For the PAE measure , 5 additional US children who did not provide a single response and thus had zero errors were removed . After the outlier exclusion , it turned out that Chinese children ( M = 4 . 24 , SD = 2 . 61 ) provided more correct answers than US children ( M = 3 . 17 , SD = 2 . 87 ) , but the difference was marginally significant , t ( 90 ) = 1 . 86 , p = . 07 , d = . 39 . Also , US children ( M = 1 . 05 , SD = 1 . 89 ) provided marginally more incorrect answers than Chinese children ( M = . 50 , SD = . 84 ) , t ( 91 ) = - 1 . 90 , p = . 06 , d = . 40 . The arithmetic scores were significantly higher in Chinese kindergartners ( M = 4 . 17 , SD = 3 . 73 ) than in US kindergartners ( M = 2 . 00 , SD = 4 . 19 ) , t ( 91 ) = 2 . 63 , p < . 01 , d = . 55 . Finally , PAEs in symbolic arithmetic were smaller among Chinese children ( M = 2 . 95 , SD = 6 . 05 ) than US children , ( M = 11 . 97 , SD = 19 . 41 ) , t ( 85 ) = - 3 . 18 , p < . 01 , d = . 70 . Although all the arithmetic measures reveal a tendency that Chinese kindergartners outperformed US kindergartners , arithmetic scores and PAEs provide stronger evidence that symbolic arithme - tic differs between the two nations . To examine the relations between nationality and symbolic arithmetic more in depth , we use the two measures without outliers for further analyses below . Potential mediators of nationality effects on early symbolic arithmetic Coding . The first potential mediator that we examined was a numeric task with no requirement for magnitude judgments . This Coding task ( WISC - III ; also known as Digit - Sym - bol Substitution task , WAIS - III ) yields scores ( 0 – 133 ) that are widely used to assess perfor - mance IQ of children [ 34 , 35 ] . The task is thought to index information processing speed [ 30 ] and to be more strongly correlated with arithmetic performance than other IQ subscales [ 36 ] . Performance on this task did not differ between Chinese ( M = 15 . 56 , SD = 6 . 43 ) and US kindergartners ( M = 14 . 34 , SD = 8 . 13 ) , t ( 93 ) = . 81 , ns , suggesting that our samples were equiva - lent to those in previous studies and national norms . Variability also did not differ between scores of children in the two nations , F ( 40 , 53 ) = 1 . 60 , ns . Although IQ scores correlated with overall arithmetic proficiency ( r ( 93 ) = . 60 , p < . 001 ) , it seemed highly unlikely that the nation - ality effect on symbolic arithmetic could be mediated by IQ ( because IQ differences were mini - mal ) . However , we conducted and report a mediation analysis to illustrate the statistical process . To know whether ( and how strongly ) IQ mediates nationality effects on symbolic arithme - tic , we used Preacher and Hayes’ [ 37 ] PROCESS procedure and bootstrapped mediation analy - sis to test the significance of mediation effects . When arithmetic scores were used , the total effect of nationality on symbolic arithmetic was 2 . 17 . Controlling for IQ reduced the direct effect of nationality to 1 . 93 , which remained significantly different from zero ( 95 % CI [ . 50 , 3 . 36 ] ) . In contrast , the remaining indirect effect of nationality via IQ was . 24 , which did not dif - fer from zero ( 95 % CI [ - . 56 , 1 . 16 ] ) . The indirect effect through IQ accounts for only 11 % of the total effect of nationality on symbolic arithmetic ( . 24 / 2 . 17 ) . When PAEs in the arithmetic test PLOS ONE Cognitivemediatorsof US and Chinadifferences in math PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 7 / 17 were submitted to the identical mediation analysis , the results remained similar . The most nationality effects on arithmetic PAEs took place directly through nationality itself ( - 9 . 34 , 95 % CI [ - 14 . 87 , - 3 . 82 ] ) with the small indirect effect of nationality via IQ ( . 31 , 95 % CI [ - . 85 , 2 . 29 ] ) . The indirect effect accounts for only - 3 % of the total effect of nationality ( . 31 / - 9 . 03 ) . Non - symbolic magnitude tasks . Non - symbolic number comparison . We next examined the effect of nationality on non - symbolic number comparison , using three measures that have been claimed to track math proficiency and / or the psychophysics of numerosity perception . These measures were accuracy [ 38 , 39 ] , Weber fraction [ 31 , 40 ] , and the numeric distance effect [ 41 ] . For outlier exclusion , the mean and standard deviation of reaction times of each child were computed for each numerical magnitude task ( Fig 4 ) . Responses that were slower than 2 . 5 SDs above the mean RT were excluded from analyses in number comparison and all other tasks ( 3 . 5 % of all data ) . Across all three indices of non - symbolic number comparison , we observed no differences between Chinese and US children . Overall accuracy scores ( 0 – 100 % ) for Chinese ( M = 86 . 95 , SD = 11 . 81 ) and US children ( M = 83 . 63 , SD = 15 . 00 ) , did not differ , t ( 93 ) = 1 . 21 , ns . The average Weber fraction for Chinese ( M = . 31 , SD = . 58 ) and US children ( M = . 43 , SD = . 72 ) also did not differ , t ( 93 ) = - . 94 , ns . Finally , both US and Chinese children’s accuracy reliably increased as the distance of the logarithms of compared numbers increased ( Fig 3B ) . The distance effect ( i . e . , slope of accuracy against ratio ) for Chinese children ( b = - 15 . 62 , R 2 = . 49 ) again did not differ from that of US children ( b = - 16 . 61 , R 2 = . 66 ) , F ( 1 , 12 ) = . 01 , ns . Accuracy of non - symbolic comparison did not show an association with arithmetic PAEs ( r ( 85 ) = - . 15 , p > . 05 ) , but with arithmetic scores ( r ( 91 ) = . 39 , p < . 001 ) ; however , the indirect effect of nationality on arithmetic scores by means of non - symbolic number compari - son was . 33 , which accounts for only 15 % of the total effect ( . 33 / 2 . 17 ) . This indirect effect did not differ from zero ( 95 % CI [ - . 29 , 1 . 10 ] ) . Similarly , the indirect effect of nationality on arith - metic PAEs through non - symbolic comparison was . 01 , which is not different from zero ( 95 % CI [ - 1 . 36 , . 99 ] ) and accounts for less than - 1 % of the total nationality effect ( . 01 / - 9 . 03 ) .

The quality of non - symbolic approximate addition ( a + b > or < c ) was examined using the same indices as non - symbolic number comparison . Again , across all indices , no nation effects were observed . Accuracy scores ( 0 – 100 % ) did not differ for Chinese ( M = 73 . 64 , SD = 13 . 4 ) and US children ( M = 69 . 48 , SD = 17 . 02 ) , t ( 93 ) = 1 . 33 , ns . Average Weber fractions were also similar for Chinese ( M = . 74 , SD = . 76 ) and US children ( M = 1 . 04 , SD = . 99 ) , t ( 93 ) = - 1 . 64 , ns . Finally , both US and Chinese children’s accu - racy increased with the distance of the logarithms of the sum and the comparison ( Fig 3B ) . The distance effect was not different between Chinese ( b = - 63 . 23 , R 2 = . 94 ) and US children ( b = - 60 . 39 , R 2 = . 84 ) , F ( 1 , 8 ) = . 03 , ns . Although accuracy of non - symbolic approximate addi - tion showed a positive correlation with arithmetic scores ( r ( 91 ) = . 28 , p < . 01 ) , the indirect effect of nationality on arithmetic scores by means of non - symbolic number addition again was as low as . 24 ( . 24 / 2 . 17 = 11 % ) and statistically non - significant ( 95 % CI [ - . 12 , . 98 ] ) . Accuracy of non - symbolic approximate addition was not correlated with arithmetic PAEs ( r ( 85 ) = - . 04 , p > . 05 ) , and the indirect effect of nationality on arithmetic PAEs via non - symbolic addition was not different from zero ( - . 02 , 95 % CI [ - 1 . 08 , . 72 ] ) , explaining less than 1 % of nationality effects ( - . 02 / - 9 . 03 ) . Non - symbolic number - line estimation . Like the two numerical magnitude tasks , estimates of numerical magnitudes on a number line could be assessed with Percent Absolute Error as well as by obtaining parameter values for psychometric functions linking the numeric stimuli to the spatial judgment [ 42 – 44 ] . We evaluated a number of competing psychometric functions for this purpose , including log - linear [ 45 , 46 ] , one - cycle power , and two - cycle power models [ 47 ] . Consistent with previous reports testing the logarithmic and linear models separately against these models in the context of symbolic number - line estimation [ 44 , 48 ] , the combined log - linear model provided a better fit to median estimates than the one - cycle power ( Δ AICc = 29 . 76 ; probability of log - linear = 99 . 99 % ) and two - cycle power models ( Δ AICc = 54 . 96 ; proba - bility of log - linear = 99 . 99 % ) . For this reason , we used the λ value of the log - linear model , which tracks the degree of logarithmicity in children’s estimates , to provide a psychophysical characterization of numeric estimation . Errors in Chinese children’s estimates ( PAE = 100 × | estimate - given magnitude | / upper bound magnitude , M = 22 . 18 , SD = 6 . 73 ) were smaller than errors in US children’s estimates ( PAE , M = 28 . 79 , SD = 7 . 90 ) , t ( 93 ) = - 4 . 40 , p < . 0001 , d = . 91 . Moreover , the median estimates by Chinese children were less logarithmic ( λ = . 63 ) than those by US children ( λ = . 95 ) ( Fig 3B ) . Finally , when λ scores were computed for individual children’s estimates , the mean λ score for US children ( M = . 85 , SD = . 30 ) was higher than for Chinese children ( M = . 70 , SD = . 37 ) , t ( 93 ) = - 2 . 07 , p < 05 , d = . 43 . Errors in non - symbolic number - line estimation were nega - tively correlated with arithmetic scores ( r ( 91 ) = - . 37 , p < . 001 ) , indicating that more accurate estimates accompanied better symbolic arithmetic performance . More importantly , we found that the indirect effect differed from zero , 1 . 04 ( 95 % CI [ . 42 , 2 . 08 ] ) , and that 48 % ( 1 . 04 / 2 . 17 ) of the nationality effect on arithmetic scores arose indirectly through non - symbolic number - line estimation . When arithmetic PAEs were used for symbolic arithmetic , there was a positive association between arithmetic PAEs and errors in non - symbolic number - line estimation ( r ( 85 ) = . 30 , p < . 01 ) . Also , the indirect effect of nationality through non - symbolic number - line estimation was different from zero , - 2 . 14 ( 95 % CI [ - 5 . 74 , - . 17 ] ) , which equals 24 % of the total nationality effect ( - 2 . 14 / - 9 . 03 ) . Symbolic magnitude tasks . Symbolic number comparison . Symbolic number comparison also differed between Chinese and US children . Percent correct was greater for Chinese chil - dren ( M = 86 . 10 , SD = 13 . 67 ) than US children ( M = 79 . 02 , SD = 16 . 56 ) , t ( 93 ) = 2 . 28 , p < . 05 , d = . 47 . The average Weber fraction was smaller among Chinese children ( M = . 34 , SD = . 61 ) than US children ( M = . 64 , SD = . 89 ) , although values for children in the two nations differed PLOS ONE Cognitivemediatorsof US and Chinadifferences in math PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 9 / 17 only marginally , t ( 93 ) = - 1 . 96 , p = . 05 , d = . 41 . Both US and Chinese children became more accurate with increasing distance between the logarithms of the numbers being compared ; the magnitude of the distance effect did not differ between Chinese ( b = - 10 . 93 , R 2 = . 89 ) and US children ( b = - 10 . 71 , R 2 = . 53 ) , F ( 1 , 12 ) = . 002 , ns . Accuracy of symbolic number comparison predicted arithmetic scores ( r ( 91 ) = . 50 , p < . 001 ) . Further , we found that the indirect effect was substantial , . 75 ( 95 % CI [ . 01 , 1 . 76 ] ) , indicating that 35 % ( . 75 / 2 . 17 ) of the nationality effect on symbolic arithmetic was an indirect effect mediated through symbolic number comparison . Accuracy of symbolic number comparison was also associated with arithmetic PAEs ( r ( 85 ) = - . 32 , p < . 01 ) , but the indirect effect on arithmetic PAEs did not differ from zero , - . 92 ( 95 % CI [ - 4 . 31 , . 36 ] ) , accounting for 10 % of nationality effects . Symbolic approximate addition . Across most indices of symbolic approximate addition , Chinese children outperformed US children . Overall accuracy ( 0 – 100 % ) was greater for Chi - nese ( M = 72 . 57 , SD = 13 . 97 ) than for US children ( M = 64 . 59 , SD = 14 . 46 ) , t ( 93 ) = 2 . 72 , p = . 008 , d = . 56 . The mean Weber fraction was lower for Chinese ( M = . 88 , SD = . 83 ) than for US children ( M = 1 . 30 , SD = . 96 ) , t ( 93 ) = - 2 . 30 , p < . 05 , d = . 48 . Finally , both US and Chinese chil - dren’s accuracy reliably increased with the distance of the logarithms of the numbers being compared , though the distance effect did not differ between Chinese ( b = - 53 . 92 , R 2 = . 87 ) and US children ( b = - 52 . 76 , R 2 = . 84 ) , F ( 1 , 8 ) = . 006 , ns . Accuracy of symbolic approximate addi - tion correlated positively with arithmetic scores ( r ( 91 ) = . 49 , p < . 001 ) . Further , the indirect effect was significant , . 92 ( 95 % CI [ . 21 , 1 . 99 ] ) , which meant that 42 % ( . 92 / 2 . 17 ) of the national - ity effect on arithmetic scores arose indirectly through symbolic approximate addition . Simi - larly , accuracy of symbolic approximate addition presented a negative correlation with arithmetic PAEs ( r ( 85 ) = - . 22 , p < . 05 ) . The indirect effect on arithmetic PAEs was different from zero , - . 99 ( 95 % CI [ - 2 . 84 , - . 11 ] ) , which indicates that about 11 % of the nationality effect ( - . 99 / - 9 . 03 ) occurred indirectly through symbolic approximate addition . Symbolic number - line estimation . As with non - symbolic number - line estimation , the com - bined log - linear model provided a better fit to median estimates than the one - cycle power model ( Δ AICc = 23 . 78 ; probability of log - linear = 99 . 99 % ) and two - cycle power model ( Δ AICc = 44 . 72 ; probability of log - linear = 99 . 99 % ) . Additionally , the proportion of children’s estimates best fit by the log - linear model was also higher than those fit by the one - cycle power model ( log - linear , 64 % ; 1CPM , 36 % ) , and two - cycle power model ( log - linear , 87 % ; 2CPM , 13 % ) . For this reason , we again used the λ value of the log - linear model . As with other measures of symbolic numeric knowledge , Chinese children’s accuracy of symbolic number - line estimates ( PAE , M = 17 . 70 , SD = 8 . 32 ) was greater than US children’s accuracy ( PAE , M = 23 . 73 , SD = 10 . 44 ) , t ( 93 ) = 3 . 13 , p < . 01 , d = . 65 . Chinese children’s median estimates were less logarithmic ( λ = . 25 ) than those in US children ( λ = . 55 ) . Finally , when λ scores were computed for individual children’s estimates , the mean λ score for US chil - dren ( M = . 75 , SD = . 32 ) was higher than for Chinese children ( M = . 47 , SD = . 37 ) , t ( 93 ) = - 3 . 86 , p < . 001 , d = . 80 . Thus , consistent with previous reports [ 25 ] , US kindergartners’ sym - bolic number line estimates were less accurate and more logarithmic than those of Chinese children . Because amount of error in symbolic estimates was negatively associated with arith - metic scores ( r ( 91 ) = - . 36 , p < . 001 ) , and because estimation errors were greater among US children , symbolic number - line estimation accuracy was expected to mediate the relation between nationality and symbolic arithmetic . Consistent with this hypothesis , the indirect effect via symbolic number - line estimation differed from zero , . 71 ( 95 % CI [ . 12 , 1 . 76 ] ) ; 33 % ( . 71 / 2 . 17 ) of the nationality effect on arithmetic scores was accounted for indirectly through symbolic number - line estimation . Errors in symbolic number - line estimation were also posi - tively correlated with arithmetic PAEs ( r ( 85 ) = . 44 , p < . 001 ) . The indirect effect through PLOS ONE Cognitivemediatorsof US and Chinadifferences in math PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 10 / 17 symbolic estimation was different from zero , - 2 . 78 ( 95 % CI [ - 8 . 00 , - . 28 ] ) , explaining 31 % of national effects on arithmetic PAEs ( - 2 . 78 / - 9 . 03 ) . Cognitive mechanisms underlying nationality effects on early symbolic arithmetic Previously , independent mediation analyses demonstrated that nation effects on symbolic arithmetic were partially mediated by a variety of cognitive abilities , including non - symbolic number - line estimation , symbolic number comparison , symbolic approximate addition , and symbolic number - line estimation . Because these cognitive abilities were correlated with each other , the total indirect effect of nationality on symbolic arithmetic that occurred through these cognitive abilities was not equivalent to the sum of the partial effects . To control for col - linearity , multiple mediation analyses were conducted to estimate how much of the effect of nationality on symbolic arithmetic was explained by indirect effects through the cognitive abil - ities , and which mechanisms uniquely mediated relations between nation and symbolic arith - metic . For easier interpretation of the results , we used error rates ( 100—percent correct ) instead of percent correct for comparison and approximate addition tasks . This linear trans - formation did not change the mediation results but allowed the measures to denote inaccuracy similar to the PAE in number - line tasks . We found that only 19 % of the total effects of nationality on arithmetic scores were directly from nationality itself ( c’ = . 41 , 95 % CI [ - 1 . 13 , 1 . 95 ] ) ; 81 % of the total effects were mediated by numeric magnitude abilities ( ∑ ab = 1 . 76 , 95 % CI [ . 66 , 3 . 28 ] , Fig 5A ) . When arithmetic PAEs were used as an outcome variable for symbolic arithmetic , 61 % of nationality effects on sym - bolic arithmetic occurred directly from nationality itself , but the direct effect was not different from zero ( c’ = - 5 . 47 , 95 % CI [ - 11 . 23 , . 28 ] ) ; 39 % of the total effects took place indirectly through numeric magnitude abilities , and the mediation effect was different from zero ( ∑ ab = - 3 . 55 , 95 % CI [ - 9 . 15 , - . 11 ] , Fig 5B ) . Thus , if the total effect of nation on symbolic arithmetic is the magnitude of the " learning gap " between Chinese and US children , a substantial amount of this learning gap may take place by means of numerical magnitude knowledge . To explore underlying mechanisms in more detail , we tested the contributions of the com - bination of symbolic numerical magnitude tasks that were significant in the multiple medica - tion analysis and of the combination of symbolic and spatial tasks that were significant in simple mediation analyses . The mediation of the three symbolic numeric measures accounted for 61 % of nationality effects on symbolic arithmetic scores and 43 % of nationality effects on arithmetic PAEs . Compared to non - symbolic numeric measures , however , their mediation effects were not significantly greater ( ∑ ab = 1 . 32 , 95 % CI [ - . 26 , 2 . 46 ] for arithmetic scores ; ∑ ab = - 3 . 88 , 95 % CI [ - 11 . 02 , . 29 ] for arithmetic PAE ) . The combination of symbolic - numeric and spatial - numeric judgments ( i . e . , three symbolic numeric judgments and non - symbolic num - ber - line estimation ) accounted for 81 % of the total effects on arithmetic scores and 45 % of the total effects on arithmetic PAEs . The indirect effects through symbolic - numeric and spatial - numeric tasks were significantly greater than those of the combination of non - symbolic and non - spatial tasks ( ∑ ab = 1 . 74 , 95 % CI [ . 49 , 3 . 41 ] for arithmetic scores ; ∑ ab = - 4 . 06 , 95 % CI [ - 10 . 91 , - . 02 ] for arithmetic PAEs ) . Symbolic arithmetic as a mediator between nationality and cognitive abilities One may argue that the effect of nationality on symbolic arithmetic is not mediated by numer - ical magnitude knowledge ; rather , numerical magnitude knowledge is entirely mediated by symbolic arithmetic . This possibility was tested for in new mediation analyses using two PLOS ONE Cognitivemediatorsof US and Chinadifferences in math PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 11 / 17 symbolic arithmetic measures . For symbolic arithmetic scores , symbolic arithmetic perfor - mance did significantly mediate nationality effects on all six numerical magnitude tasks ( ab’s ranged from - 3 . 77 to - 1 . 21 , all of which significantly differed from zero ; Fig 6A ) . However , there remained significant direct effects of nationality on numerical abilities , as predicted by our original mediation model . Symbolic arithmetic PAEs mediated nationality effects on sym - bolic - numeric and spatial - numeric tasks ( ab’s ranged from - 2 . 84 to - . 08 , four of which signifi - cantly differed from zero , Fig 6B ) , but a direct effect of nationality still remained significant on non - symbolic number - line estimation . Discussion Since at least 1967 , when large - scale international comparisons of math achievement started , US children have trailed their East Asian peers across a wide range of math tests . However , attempts to account for this finding have not identified specific cognitive mediators by which these inputs exercise their effects . In this paper , we used a multiple mediation analysis to iden - tify specific mechanisms by which national differences in math proficiency may arise . We hypothesized that national differences in mathematics skills , particularly symbolic arithmetic , arise through national differences in numerical magnitude representations . Fig 5 . Multiple mediation analyses with arithmetic scores ( A ) and arithmetic PAEs ( B ) as an outcome variable . Solid and dotted lines represent significant and non - significant relations between variables , respectively . Results imply that a substantial amount of the nationality effects may occur through the numerical magnitude tasks ( a 1 b 1 + a 2 b 2 + a 3 b 3 + a 4 b 4 + a 5 b 5 + a 6 b 6 ) . Only a non - significant proportion of the total effects ( c’ ) was explained by nationality itself . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 . g005 PLOS ONE Cognitivemediatorsof US and Chinadifferences in math PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 12 / 17 This possibility implies that if the representations of numerical magnitude of US kindergart - ners were equivalent to those of their Chinese peers , they might be as good at symbolic arithmetic—in spite of learning English number words , receiving the amount of math instruction provided by US schools , being taught by teachers with American training , and typically valuing mathematics less than Chinese peers . Our findings supported the hypothesis that nation effects were substantially indirect and that they occurred by means of superior numerical magnitude representations . Mediation analyses revealed that a considerable proportion of the whole nationality effect on symbolic arithmetic ( 81 % for arithmetic scores , 39 % for arithmetic PAEs ) arose from the indirect paths of numerical magnitude representations , specifically those indexed by symbolic number com - parison , symbolic approximate addition , and both symbolic and non - symbolic number - line estimation ( 81 % in the 6 - mediator analysis and 80 % in the 4 - symbolic - and - spatial - mediator analysis for arithmetic scores ; 45 % in the 6 - mediator analysis and 33 % in the 4 - symbolic - and - spatial - mediator analysis for arithmetic PAEs ) . The relative importance of symbolic over non - symbolic skills seems straightforward—quality of perception of non - symbolic numerosity seems likely to be a universal cognitive capacity , whereas quality of symbolic number requires Fig 6 . Alternative mediations . Solid and dotted lines represent significant and non - significant relations between variables respectively . Symbolic arithmetic scores are the significant mediator of the effect of nation on all six numerical magnitude tasks ( A ) , whereas symbolic arithmetic PAEs significantly mediate nationality effects on symbolic - numeric and spatial - numeric tasks ( B ) . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 . g006 PLOS ONE Cognitivemediatorsof US and Chinadifferences in math PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0255283 August 25 , 2021 13 / 17 cultural learning [ 49 , 50 ] . The highly similar psychophysical profile of non - symbolic number comparison and addition in Chinese and US children support this view . It was somewhat surprising , then , that non - symbolic number - line estimation differed strongly between Chinese and American children , as well as that the strength of that difference was correlated with symbolic arithmetic . Any attempt to explain this is admittedly speculative , but it may be that accurately estimating the position of a set on a number line requires skills that are common to the symbolic skills tested ( e . g . , ability to encode equivalent ratio informa - tion , as in the analogy •••• : •• : : •• : • ) . Beyond these findings , the current study has several limitations that should be addressed in future research . First , like all cross - cultural studies , many unmeasured differences exist and may contribute to the outcome variables of interest . Second , the study was correlational and was conducted with only a single age group . Including an experimental intervention and track - ing its effects over time would provide a more robust test of the mediating effects of numerical magnitude judgments . Further , the current study sought to investigate the cognitive mecha - nisms of cross - national differences in symbolic arithmetic , but children were recruited only from the US and China . Future work is needed to test whether findings in the present research generalize to comparisons of other nations with different languages , cultures , curricula , and economic status . Lastly , our study involved relatively a small number of children for media - tion . Although the power analysis using the Sobel test showed that our study was adequately powered , there is little consensus on the method of power analysis for mediation [ 29 , 51 ] . As a result , a larger sample may prove to be necessary . The results from our study closely parallel two sets of prior findings . The first concerns the causal relation of number - line estimation to math proficiency ; producing improvements in children’s mapping of numerical magnitude onto a number - line also improved how well chil - dren learned answers to arithmetic problems from a math lesson [ 52 ] . These results provide experimental evidence that buttresses our mediational analysis . The second set of relevant findings concerns the relation between SES and math proficiency . Like US children in the cur - rent study , children from low SES backgrounds within the US population exhibit deficits in representations of numerical magnitudes and math proficiency relative to children from more affluent backgrounds . In addition , interventions that focus on numerical magnitude represen - tations in low SES children have eliminated the differences in math proficiency between low and high SES children ( e . g . , [ 15 ] ) . Combined with our current results , these results imply that the effect of SES on early math proficiency might also be mediated by the quality of numerical magnitude representations . Finally , the combination of all three results has an important implication for closing the “learning gap . ” Much , perhaps most , of the “learning gap” between US and Chinese students could be closed if educational interventions improved numerical magnitude representations of American children . Experimental studies that examine children’s numerical magnitude knowledge are strongly encouraged . Supporting information S1 Dataset . Math assessment and digit coding . ( CSV ) S2 Dataset .
