E - mail : kthorn @ cgr . harvard . edu Received : 15 November 2003 Accepted : 8 March 2004 Abstract Green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) has become an increasingly popular protein tag for determining protein localization and abundance . With the availability of GFP variants with altered ﬂuorescence spectra , as well as GFP homologues from other organisms , multi - colour ﬂuorescence with protein tags is now possible , as is measuring protein interactions using ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . We have created a set of yeast tagging vectors containing codon - optimized variants of GFP , CFP ( cyan ) , YFP ( yellow ) , and Sapphire ( a UV - excitable GFP ) . These codon - optimized tags are twice as detectable as unoptimized tags . We have also created a tagging vector containing the monomeric DsRed construct tdimer2 , which is up to 15 - fold more detectable than tags currently in use . These tags signiﬁcantly improve the detection limits for live - cell ﬂuorescence imaging in yeast , and provide sufﬁcient distinguishable ﬂuorophores for four - colour imaging .

Keywords : green ﬂuorescent protein ; red ﬂuorescent protein ; DsRed ; multicolour ﬂuorescence Introduction Functional analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes has been greatly aided by the ease with which genes can be deleted or tagged by homol - ogous recombination into the genome . Cassettes for tagging genes with a wide range of sequences have been developed , including epitope tags for immunochemistry , protein puriﬁcation tags and green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) variants for micros - copy . Because the tags are introduced by directed recombination into the genome , these cassettes allow modiﬁcation of the targeted protein in its native context without perturbing its native reg - ulation . These tags have become essential tools for the study of yeast genes . Fluorescent pro - tein fusions have been particularly useful , as they allow ﬂuorescence microscopy of live cells with a minimum of perturbation . A number of plasmids have been speciﬁcally designed for this purpose , encoding GFP , YFP or CFP with a variety of selectable markers ( Hailey et al . , 2002 ; Reid et al . , 2002 ; Wach et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , ﬂuorescent protein fusions can be used to detect the interaction of two proteins by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . Because these tagging cassettes can be fused to proteins under the expression of their native pro - moter , the level of the expressed protein is often quite low , making it difﬁcult to detect the fusion protein . To improve the expression of ﬂuorescent protein fusions , we have constructed a set of four different wavelength GFP variants which have been optimized to use the most abundant codons in yeast . These plasmids are derivatives of pFA6a ( Wach et al . , 1997 ) and encode a codon - optimized GFP variant ( Cormack et al . , 1997 ) and a selectable marker ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5 , C . albi - cans URA3 , or KanR ) . The GFP variants encoded in these plasmids are codon - optimized GFP , CFP and Sapphire ( Tsien , 1998 ) and the improved YFPs Venus ( Nagai et al . , 2002 ) and Citrine . We ﬁnd that these tags are up to twice as bright as unop - timized tags . To further improve the utility of these proteins , we have generated true monomeric CFP and YFP constructs which incorporate the Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . 662 M . A . Sheff and K . S . Thorn A206R mutation to block dimerization ( Zacharias et al . , 2002 ) , and CFP and YFP constructs fused to the 3HA and 13Myc epitope tags ( Evan et al . , 1985 ; Field et al . , 1988 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) to allow use of both ﬂuorescence and immuno - chemical approaches . Additionally , we have con - structed a tagging cassette for generating fusions to the monomeric DsRed variant tdimer2 ( Camp - bell et al . , 2002 ) . This ﬂuorophore is up to 15 - fold brighter than unoptimized YFP . Together , these cassettes provide sufﬁcient ﬂuorophores for simul - taneous four - colour imaging , as well as multiple potential FRET pairs . Materials and methods Strains and media Escherichia coli host strains were XL - 10 gold and DH5 α . Yeast strain JYL69 ( MAT a ura3 - 1 ADE2 + his3 - 11 , 15 leu2 - 3 , 112 trp1 - 1 can1 - 100 ; isogenic to W303 ) was used for all experiments . Standard yeast media were used for selection of transfor - mants ( Sherman , 2002 ) . For ﬂuorescence mea - surements , yeast were grown in synthetic com - plete or the appropriate drop - out media made using low - ﬂuorescence yeast nitrogen base ( yeast nitrogen base without riboﬂavin and folic acid ; 5 g / l ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 1 g / l KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 5 g / l MgSO 4 , 0 . 1 g / l NaCl , 0 . 1 g / l Ca 2 Cl , 0 . 5 mg / l H 3 BO 4 , 0 . 04 mg / l CuSO 4 , 0 . 1 mg / l KI , 0 . 2 mg / l FeCl 3 , 0 . 4 mg / l MnSO 4 , 0 . 2 mg / l Na 2 MoO 4 , 0 . 4 mg / l ZnSO 4 , 2 µ g / l biotin , 0 . 4 mg / l calcium pantothen - ate , 2 mg / l inositol , 0 . 4 mg / l niacin , 0 . 2 mg / l PABA , 0 . 4 mg / l pyridoxine HCl , 0 . 4 mg / l thi - amine ) . This medium has negligible autoﬂuores - cence ( within 10 % of water ) . We have found that commercial yeast nitrogen base , even without vita - mins , is often highly ﬂuorescent and so we prepare our own from the above components , purchased from Sigma . Construction of optimized tagging vectors All primers used are described in Table 1 . Codon - optimized green ﬂuorescent protein ( yEGFP1 ; Cormack et al . , 1997 ) was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers F2 and R2 , adding Pac I and Asc I sites , respectively , and cloned into plasmid pDH5 ( Hailey et al . , 2002 ) , replacing YFP to give pFA6a – yEGFP1 – SpHIS5 ( Figure 1 ) . The selectable marker , Sz . pombe HIS5 ( SpHIS5 ) , complements S . cerevisiae HIS3 . The yEGFP cloned into this plasmid contains a point mutation converting Met 233 to Ile . This mutation is present in all GFP variants subsequently derived from this plasmid . As this residue is disordered and not observed in the GFP crystal structure , we expected it to have little effect on the ﬂuorescence properties of GFP . We veriﬁed this by reverting this mutation in our yEVenus construct and found that it had no effect on ﬂuorescence . We have therefore left this mutation in all the GFP derivatives described here . An optimized linker was introduced into the yEGFP construct by phosphorylating primers L1 and L2 , annealing them together , and ligating them into pFA6a – yEGFP1 – SpHis5 cut with Bam HI and Pac I , yielding pFA6a – link – yEGFP1 – SpHIS5 . GFP variants were constructed by site - directed mutagenesis of yEGFP1 using the Quikchange multi and Quikchange XL kits ( Stratagene ) . In all cases , the replacement codons were chosen to be frequently used codons in yeast genes . Following mutagenesis , the GFP variant sequence was con - ﬁrmed by sequencing and then subcloned into the unmutagenized pFA6a vector using the Pac I and Asc I sites . The ﬁnal GFP mutants contain the fol - lowing amino acid changes relative to : wild - type GFP — yEGFP1 , F64L , S65T ; yEVenus — F46L , F64L , S65G , S72A , M153T , V163A , S175G ; yECitrine — S65G , V68L , Q69M , S72A , T203Y ; yECFP — F64L , S65T , Y66W , N146I , M153T , V163A ; yESapphire — S72A , Y145F , T203I . yEYFP , used as an intermediate in the construc - tion of yEVenus and yECitrine , was constructed from yEGFP1 by introducing mutations S65G , V68L , S72A and T203Y with the Quikchange multi - kit , using pFA6a – yEGFP1 – SpHIS5 as tem - plate and mutagenic primers M2 and M1 . yEVenus was constructed from yEYFP using the Quikchange multi - kit , with plasmid pDH5 – yEYFP as template and mutagenic primers M3 , M4 and M5 , adding mutations F46L , M153T , V163A and S175G . yECitrine was made using the Quikchange XL kit , with pDH5 – yEYFP as template and mutagenic primers M8 and M12 , adding mutation Q69M . To make yECFP , mutations Y66W , N146I and V163A were introduced with the Quikchange multi - kit , using yEGFP1 as the template and muta - genic primers M4 , M6 and M7 . Mutation M153T was then introduced to the resulting plasmid Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Yeast 2004 ; 21 : 661 – 670 . Optimized cassettes for ﬂuorescent protein tagging 663 Table 1 .

The G418 resistance marker ( KanR ) was intro - duced into these plasmids by subcloning the Bgl II – Eco RI fragment of pDH3 ( Hailey et al . , 2002 ) into the GFP variant plasmids . Candida albi - cans URA3 ( CaURA3 ) was introduced by sub - cloning the Bgl II – Sac I fragment of pAG60 ( Gold - stein et al . , 1999 ) into the GFP variant plasmids . To construct pFA6a – link – tdimer2 – SpHis5 , tdimer2 ( Campbell et al . , 2002 ) was ampliﬁed by PCR with primers F1 and R1 , adding Pac I and Asc I sites , and cloned into pFA6a – link – yEVenus - SpHIS5 . To fuse the epitope tags 3HA and 13Myc onto the ﬂuorescent tags in our tagging cassettes , we ﬁrst created novel Xma I and Eco RI restriction sites and removed the stop codon from yECFP and yECitrine by site - directed mutagenesis with the Quikchange XL kit ( Stratagene ) and mutagenic primers M14 and M15 . The 3HA tag was then subcloned into pKT102 and pKT140 , using the new Xma I site and existing Asc I site . The 13Myc tag was subcloned into pKT102 and pKT140 using the new Xma I and Eco RI sites . The A206R mutation in yECitrine and yECFP was introduced using the Quikchange XL kit ( Stratagene ) and mutagenic primers M16 and M17 ( yECFP ) and M18 and M19 ( yECitrine ) . The resulting yEmCit and yEmCFP constructs were then subcloned back into their unmutagenized vec - tors using the Pac I and Asc I restriction sites .

Overview of the new tagging constructs . ( A ) Structure of the tagging constructs . The organization is similar to other common tagging constructs , with a forward PCR primer ( F5 ) followed by the ﬂuorophore to be fused to the gene of interest , the S . cerevisiae ADH1 terminator and a selectable marker . The sequences used to amplify these cassettes are 5 (cid:1) - ( gene - speciﬁc sequence ) - GGTGACGGTGCTGGTTTA - 3 (cid:1) ( F5 ) and 5 (cid:1) - ( gene - speciﬁc sequence ) - TCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG - 3 (cid:1) ( R3 ) . Restriction sites at the boundaries between elements are indicated . Sequences are not drawn to scale . ( B ) Sequence of the linker between the target protein and yEGFP . The translation and frequency of each codon in the yeast genome ( per 1000 ) are given . For reference , the most frequent codon in the yeast genome is GAA ( glutamate ) , with a frequency of 46 / 1000 . The least frequent non - stop codon is CGG ( arginine ) , with a frequency of 1 . 7 / 1000 . Codon frequencies are from http : / / www . kazusa . or . jp / codon / ( Nakamura et al . , 2000 ) manufacturer’s instructions , with an annealing temperature of 65 ◦ C and an extension time of 140 s . The forward primer consisted of the 40 3 (cid:1) nucleotides of the gene to be tagged ( excluding the stop codon ) fused to F5 ; the reverse primer consisted of the reverse complement of the 40 nucleotides 3 (cid:1) of the stop codon fused to R3 . Tag - ging of the targeted gene was conﬁrmed by colony PCR to conﬁrm the presence of both integration junctions and the absence of the unmodiﬁed gene ( Petracek and Longtine , 2002 ) . Fluorometry and microscopy The ﬂuorescence of yeast cultures was measured in black 96 - well plates with a Spectramax Gem - ini XS . Excitation and emission wavelengths were chosen to maximize the ratio of ﬂuorescence inten - sities of the tagged strain to the untagged strain . The following excitation / emission pairs ( in nm ) were used : Sapphire , 399 / 508 ; GFP , 476 / 512 ; YFP and variants , 502 / 532 ; tdimer2 , 552 / 579 . In all cases the ‘autocutoff’ feature of the instrument was used . To correct for variations in cell num - ber , these ﬂuorescence intensities were then nor - malized by the OD 660 of the culture measured in transparent 96 - well plates with a Spectramax Plus 384 . Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioscop 2 with a Plan - NeoFluar 100 × / 1 . 3 NA oil immer - sion objective . Images were recorded on a Zeiss Axiocam MRm with 2 × 2 binning . The fol - lowing ﬁlter sets were used : YFP , Chroma No . 41 028 , HQ500 / 20 exciter , Q515lp beamsplitter , HQ535 / 30 emitter ; GFP , Zeiss No . 38 , BP470 / 40 exciter , FT495 beamsplitter , BP525 / 50 emitter ; tdimer2 , Zeiss No . 43 , BP545 / 20 exciter , FT570 beamsplitter , BP605 / 70 emitter .

Results and discussion Determinants of ﬂuorescent intensity Fusion of a DNA sequence to the 3 (cid:1) end of an open reading frame in its native genomic context does not affect the promoter or upstream regulatory regions . We therefore expect that C - terminal ﬂuo - rescent protein fusions will be transcribed at levels comparable to the untagged protein . The brightness of the fusion depends primarily on three proper - ties of the ﬂuorescent protein : its intrinsic bright - ness , folding efﬁciency , and translation efﬁciency . Increasing any one of these will increase the bright - ness of the fusion protein . Under long exposures in a ﬂuorescence microscope , the photobleaching rate of the protein will also be important . The intrinsic brightness of a ﬂuorescent protein ( FP ) is the product of the ﬂuorescent quantum yield and the extinction coefﬁcient , and is affected only by the sequence of the FP and by the surrounding solution ( as many FPs are quenched by low pH or high chloride ) . The folding efﬁciency is also primarily determined by the sequence of the FP and the surrounding environment ( temperature and pH ) and possibly by interference between the FP and the protein to which it is fused . Translation efﬁciency is affected primarily by the codon usage of the FP , and altering the codon usage of FPs to conform more closely to the preferred codons in the expression host has been shown to improve expression of the FP ( Cormack et al . , 1997 ; Crameri et al . , 1996 ) . As inefﬁcient translation or inefﬁcient folding reduce expression compared to that of the untagged protein , we expect that improvements in brightness from codon optimization result from restoring expression of the fusion protein towards that of the untagged protein . For most purposes , however , what matters is not the absolute brightness of the ﬂuorescent protein fusion , but its brightness relative to the background ﬂuorescence ( autoﬂuorescence ) of yeast . Because modern imaging systems are sensitive enough to detect the autoﬂuorescence of yeast easily , this sets the lower limit for FP detection . Thus , it can be advantageous to use a protein that ﬂuoresces in a region of the spectrum with low yeast autoﬂuores - cence , even if this protein is less bright than others . In this paper , we calculate the detectability of a ﬂu - orescent tag as the ratio intensity of the ﬂuorescent tag : intensity of the yeast autoﬂuorescence , giving a signal - to - background ratio ( SBR ) .

Thorn Construction of tagging plasmids We set out to build an improved set of ﬂuorescent tagging plasmids for use in yeast . We ﬁrst con - structed a tagging vector ( pFA6a – yEGFP1 – SpHIS - 5 ) containing the yeast codon - optimized GFP , yEGFP1 , which has previously been shown to be substantially brighter than unoptimized GFP when expressed in yeast ( Cormack et al . , 1997 ) . The remainder of this plasmid is identical to pFA6a – GFP – HIS3MX6 ( Wach et al . , 1997 ) . We then introduced mutations into yEGFP1 to con - struct the improved YFP , Venus ( Nagai et al . , 2002 ) . We expected this yEVenus construct to be brighter than unoptimized Venus due to improved expression resulting from codon optimization . We compared the ﬂuorescence of our yEVenus construct with the unoptimized Venus by generat - ing fusions of both ﬂuorescent tags to the highly abundant yeast protein Cdc19p ( data not shown ) . Surprisingly , the yEVenus fusion was not signiﬁ - cantly brighter than the unoptimized Venus fusion . Examination of the sequence of the resulting fusion construct revealed that the forward primer used to amplify the pFA6a vector , which forms a linker between the tagged protein and the ﬂuorophore ( F3 ; Table 1 ) included two infrequently used argi - nine codons ( CGA and CGG ) , which occur in the yeast genome at a frequency of only 0 . 3 % and 0 . 2 % ( Nakamura et al . , 2000 ) . Use of a primer ( F4 ) which did not include these poor codons resulted in a fusion construct twice as bright as the unopti - mized Venus ( data not shown ) . We therefore added an improved linker to our tagging plasmid to give pFA6a – link – yEVenus – SpHIS5 . This linker must fulﬁl three functions : it is the primer binding site for PCR ampliﬁcation of the tagging cassette , and so should be GC - rich to give a high T m ; it forms a linker between the protein and the tag and so should be ﬂexible ; and it should be codon - optimized to give high expression . The resulting linker ( primer F5 ; Figure 1 ) fulﬁls all of these requirements : it encodes the Gly - rich sequence GDGAGL , it has a T m of 60 ◦ C , and all codons in it occur frequently in yeast . Tagging of Cdc19p with this new construct gave a strain that was twice as bright as the unoptimized Venus , as expected . Yeast codon - optimized versions of CFP , Citrine , and Sapphire were then constructed in the vector by site - directed mutagenesis of yEGFP ( Figure 1 ) . Citrine is an improved version of YFP that has increased folding efﬁciency at high temperature , increased resistance to pH and Cl − , and increased photostability ( Griesbeck et al . , 2001 ; Miyawaki et al . , 1999 ) . Sapphire ( also called H9 - 40 ) is a GFP variant that is maximally excited at 399 nm and emits at 511 nm ( Cubitt et al . , 1999 ) . It is spectrally distinct from the CFP and YFP variants , and is a potential FRET donor to DsRed ( Mizuno et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , we cloned the tdimer2 variant of DsRed ( Campbell et al . , 2002 ) into the pFA6a - link plasmid . This protein is a tandem dimer of a dimeric DsRed variant , rendering it a functional monomer . We chose to use tdimer2 because it is substantially brighter than the true monomer , mRFP1 . Although it is not yeast codon - optimized , tdimer2 has two advantages as a yeast tag : it is spectrally distinguishable from Sapphire , CFP and YFP , and it ﬂuoresces in the red , where yeast autoﬂuorescence is low . To further optimize the yECFP and yECitrine tags we generated monomeric versions of both proteins ( known as yEmCFP and yEmCitrine ) by introducing the A206R mutation ( Zacharias et al . , 2002 ) . GFP variants normally dimerize with a dissociation constant of ∼ 100 µ M , which can potentially confound studies of interacting proteins tagged with GFP variants . Introduction of the A206R mutation increases the dissociation constant by about 1000 - fold to the point where association is nearly undetectable . One additional problem when using GFP variants to follow multiple proteins is that because of the high sequence identity of the different variants , an anti - GFP antibody will recognize all GFP variants with equal afﬁnity , precluding the use of GFP anti - bodies to discriminate between the tagged proteins . To overcome this problem , we have generated tag - ging vectors containing yECFP and yECitrine with the 3HA and 13Myc tags fused to the C - terminus of the ﬂuorescent protein . The availability of distinct epitope tags for each variant allows the two vari - ants to followed independently ( Evan et al . , 1985 ; Field et al . , 1988 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) by use of the appropriate antibody . Testing of new tags To compare the suitability of these ﬂuorescent tags for use in yeast , we ﬁrst fused each tag ( except for yECFP ) to Cdc19p and Tdh3p . We chose not to Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Yeast 2004 ; 21 : 661 – 670 . Optimized cassettes for ﬂuorescent protein tagging 667 study yECFP , as CFP is known to be substantially less bright than YFP and GFP . We also tagged these genes with YFP ( from plasmid pDH5 ; Hailey et al . , 2002 ) for comparison to an unoptimized construct . Cdc19p and Tdh3p were chosen because they are highly abundant . Fluorescence of each strain was measured in a 96 - well plate reader ( Figure 2 , Table 3 ) . Because exposure times in this experiment are short and illumination intensities are low , these experiments are not expected to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by photobleaching , and therefore test the utility of these reporters for applications such as plate reader measurements or ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting . The ﬂuorescence of each strain was corrected for the number of cells as measured by OD 660 , and a signal - to - background ratio ( SBR ) was then calculated by dividing the ﬂuorescence of each strain by the ﬂuorescence of the untagged parent strain under the same conditions . To compare SBRs of tagged Cdc19p and Tdh3p , despite their different expression levels , the SBRs were normalized by the SBR of the YFP - tagged strains . This gives a measure of the increase in detectability over Table 3 .

Relative detectability of different ﬂuorophores in yeast . Yeast strains with Tdh3p and Cdc19p ( plate reader ) or Cdc11p and Nup49p ( microscope ) were tagged with the ﬂuorophores shown . A signal : background ratio for each sample was calculated by dividing the ﬂuorescence of each strain by the ﬂuorescence of the untagged parent strain under the same conditions . The signal : background ratio for each strain was then divided by that of the corresponding YFP - tagged strain to give the relative brightness , which measures the increase in detectability over unoptimized YFP . Each strain was measured at least twice on separate days , and the data shown are the average and standard deviation of all measurements . yEVL , yeast - enhanced Venus with optimized linker ; yECitL , Citrine ; yESL , Sapphire Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

Nup49p - tagged with optimized ﬂuorescent proteins . DIC ( left ) and ﬂuorescence ( right ) images of the indicated strains acquired as described in Materials and methods . After acquisition , the images were background - subtracted and scaled identically . Untagged images were acquired on the parent strain using identical settings . The untagged ﬂuorescence images are shown 20 - fold brighter than the tagged images . The YFP images ( both tagged and untagged ) have been scaled up by a factor of three to give the indicated increases in brightness unoptimized YFP , independent of expression level . The increase in detectability for each strain was measured twice on separate days , and the data shown are the average of both measurements ( Table 3 ) . We found that the results were essentially identi - cal between the Tdh3p and Cdc19p tagged strains , and these data are averaged together in Figure 2 . yEVenus and yECitrine have comparable bright - ness , and are about twice as detectable as unopti - mized YFP . yEGFP is slightly less detectable that yEVenus or yECitrine , but is roughly compara - ble . yESapphire is signiﬁcantly less detectable than the other tags ( ∼ 10 - fold less than YFP ) , due to the increased ﬂuorescence of yeast when excited at short wavelengths ( Table 3 ) . The tdimer2 tag , although less bright than the others , is much more detectable ( ∼ 15 - fold more so than YFP ) because of the very low yeast autoﬂuorescence at long wavelengths . This measurement of yeast autoﬂu - orescence is likely to be an overestimate as it is at the limit of detection of the plate reader . We then tested the suitability of these tags in microscopy applications by fusing each to the low - abundance proteins Nup49p ( a nuclear pore component ) and Cdc11p ( a septin ) . We chose to use these low - abundance proteins because they provide a more stringent test of the new tags than the Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Yeast 2004 ; 21 : 661 – 670 . Optimized cassettes for ﬂuorescent protein tagging 669 high - abundance proteins used for measurements on the plate reader . Low - abundance proteins require long exposure times ( ∼ 1 s ) to get sufﬁcient signal on the microscope , which can lead to signiﬁcant photobleaching of the ﬂuorescent protein . This measurement thus tests both the absolute brightness of the tags and their photostability . We omitted yESapphire from the compari - son because of its relative dimness . Images of each tagged strain and the untagged parent were obtained as described in Materials and methods . Representative images are shown in Figure 3 . A threshold was then chosen for each set of images to select the tagged protein ( or the entire cell for the untagged control ) . Pixels above this threshold were sorted by intensity , and the intensity of each strain is reported as the minimum intensity that includes 90 % of the pixels . For comparison , the signal : background ratio was again normalized to YFP ( Figure 2 ) . The results for these measurements are generally similar to the results obtained in the plate reader , with the exception that yECitrine is brighter than yEVenus , especially at longer expo - sure times , presumably due to its greater photosta - bility . Tdimer2 performs substantially worse in the microscopy assay than in the plate reader assay . This appears to be because yeast autoﬂuorescence at the tdimer2 emission wavelength is larger when measured on the microscope than in the plate reader ( cf . Tables 3 and 4 ) , probably due to the larger bandpasses used for excitation and emission on the microscope . Consistent with this , examination of the autoﬂuorescence spectrum of yeast excited at 552 nm reveals increased ﬂuorescence between 579 nm ( the emission wavelength measured in the plate reader ) and 570 nm ( the short - wavelength cut - off of the emission ﬁlter of the microscope ) . Use of a ﬁlter set with a red - shifted emission may improve the signal : background ratio when imaging tdimer2 constructs . To examine the suitability of these tags for simultaneous four - colour imaging , we mixed cells expressing TDH3 tagged with yESapphire , yECFP , yECitrine , and tdimer2 with untagged yeast . Images of the resulting mixture were acquired as described in Materials and methods ( Figure 4 ) . These images were then normalized by the exposure time , and cross - talk between the channels was measured by linear regression of the pixel intensities in the chan - nel corresponding to the tagged ﬂuorophore against Table 4 .

The data shown are the average and standard deviation of at least two measurements on separate days . Because these are raw intensity measurements , they are subject to ﬂuctuations from changes in the lamp brightness and alignment from one day to the next . Since these errors are common to both the tagged and untagged strain measurements , they cancel when the data are presented as ratios , as in Figure 2 . Because of this , the relative brightness reported here differs from the detectability reported in Figure 2 . the intensities of those pixels in the other channels . The resulting cross - talk values ( in % ) are shown in Table 5 . In summary , we have generated a set of tagging plasmids containing codon - optimized GFP variants and a monomeric DsRed construct . These plasmids provide ﬂuorophores suitable for four - colour imag - ing : yESapphire , yECFP , yECitrine and tdimer2 exhibit little spectral overlap and can be easily dis - tinguished , allowing labelling of multiple proteins within the same cell .

The slope of this linear regression line gives the cross - talk between channels and is shown rounded to the nearest 0 . 1 % . also signiﬁcantly brighter than those currently used for protein tagging in yeast , thereby improving the detection limit for tagged proteins . Our optimized YFP variants and GFP are about twice as bright as unoptimized ﬂuorophores , and the DsRed variant tdimer2 is up to 15 - fold brighter than unoptimized YFP . We recommend that the tdimer2 or yECitrine variants be used in future tagging projects to ensure maximum detectability of tagged proteins .
