CTTN protein expression could be a prognosticator of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) in terms of recurrence and survival . Methods : CTTN - dependent invasion was performed using migration assay in human papillomavirus - negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cells . Cortactin protein analysis in tissue microarrays was used for correlation with clinical parameters , as well as for survival analysis . Gene expression profiling in HNSCC cells was performed to unreveal CTTN signaling . Results : Knockdown of CTTN in HNSCC cells showed less invasion in vitro . Gene expression profiling showed various deregulated genes known to be involved in progression . We confirmed the link between CTTN overexpression and progres - sion in a large clinical cohort . High expression was associated with worse overall and progression - free survival . Conclusions : We propose CTTN for managing OSCC in terms of adjuvant therapy and aftercare . Furthermore , our study reveals new potential targets in CTTN signal - ing for individualized OSCC therapy . KEYWORDS biomarker , cortactin , lymph node , metastasis , oral squamous cell carcinoma 1 | INTRODUCTION Cancer of the oral cavity ( oral squamous cell carcinoma [ OSCC ] ) and the oropharynx ( oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [ OPSCC ] ) have an incidence of 400 000 cases per year ; 1 among others as hypopharynx , larynx , and nasopharynx cancers . Their entities are subsumed under the term head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . The acquired knowledge during the last decade in regard to the independent biological behavior of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) - related OPSCC have highlighted the importance to differentiate the anatomical sites in HNSCC . The main risk factor for disease - specific death in OSCC is the presence of lymph node metastases at initial diagnosis and the locoregional recurrence in up to 60 % within 2 years Dominik Horn and Madeleine Gross contributed equally to this study . Received : 28 March 2018 Revised : 21 August 2018 Accepted : 6 October 2018 DOI : 10 . 1002 / hed . 25515 Head & Neck . 2018 ; 40 : 2685 – 2694 . wileyonlinelibrary . com / journal / hed © 2018 Wiley Periodicals , Inc . 2685 after diagnosis . 2 Therefore , even in clinical node - negative necks , elective neck dissection is recommended in OSCC . 3 In all entities , clinical and pathological parameters , which are used according to the TNM classification , are the base for therapeutic decisions . However , the TNM classification widely excludes the molecular landscape of OSCC . The urgent need for a molecular classification of HNSCC tumors was partly satisfied by the discovery of the pathogenic role of high - risk HPV in OPSCC initiation and progression . 4 , 5 For the oral cavity , however , no such association to HPV - infection has been established . 6 Still , in non - HPV - related OSCC , mutational landscape is thought to be inhomogeneous due to chronic carcinogenic effect of smoking and alcohol abuse . 7 , 8 Nevertheless , molecular stratification presents an attractive target in clinical man - agement of OSCC patients . Despite the detection of a large number of candidate molecules found in studies applying high - throughput “ omic ” technologies to HNSCC tumor cohorts , 9 , 10 and the outlining of the HNSCC mutational landscape , 7 , 8 no gene has demonstrated clinical applicabil - ity yet . For an ideal candidate gene , it is essential to deter - mine whether a functional relationship exists between a molecular aberration , protein expression , and its effect on clinical tumor progression and survival . In this respect , 11q13 chromosomal band was the focus for stratification , as amplification of this region was associ - ated with adverse patient outcome in a HNSCC patient cohort . 11 This distinct amplicon includes the CTTN gene which encodes the F - actin binding protein cortactin . The region 11q13 is amplified in different tumor entities , 12 and in HNSCC , up to 30 % of all cases have an amplification of CTTN in 11q13 . 12 , 13 Cortactin is a known cytoskeletal pro - tein that promotes actin polymerization and acts as a direct binding partner of the Arp2 / 3 complex . 14 To investigate whether CTTN is causally involved in HNSCC pathogenesis , we established a platform for func - tional analyses in a set of HNSCC cell lines ( n = 20 ) from different anatomical sites . Previously , we screened them for chromosomal genetic imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization . 15 In this article , we determined the functional role of CTTN in HPV - negative HNSCC cell lines with an amplification and overexpression of CTTN by performing knockdown experi - ments using RNA interference . In addition , we performed a CTTN expression analysis by applying immunohistochemis - try ( IHC ) in a large OSCC cohort with first - line surgery according to the German National Guideline for OSCC . 16 Finally , we screened for genes and pathways deregulated upon CTTN knockdown by gene expression profiling using microarrays and identified potential downstream targets of CTTN . We propose that CTTN is clinically relevant and it is associated in regional disease progression in non - HPV - related OSCC . Furthermore , CTTN stratification can identify high - risk OSCC patients even in a clinical and histopathologically negative neck for adjustment in aftercare and potential adjuvant treatment . 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 | HNSCC cell line characterization Two HNSCC cell lines ( HNO223 and HNO237 ) with CTTN amplification and high cortactin protein expression were used for transfection experiments . 15 Cell lines were authenticated using Multiplex Cell Authentication ( Multiplexion , Heidelberg , Germany ) as recently described . 17 For further characterization , HPV status was assessed by Multiplex HPV Genotyping 18 – 20 ( see the Supplementary Materials and Methods section Sup - porting information for detailed description ) . 2 . 2 | Design of small interfering RNA and transient transfection Four different small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) were used to target cortactin : siRNA _ CTTN _ 1 ( CCGAAUGGAUAAGUCA GCUtt ) , siRNA _ CTTN _ 2 ( GGUUUCGGCGGCAAAUA CGtt ) , siRNA _ CTTN _ 3 ( CGAAUAUCAGUCGAAACUUtt ) , ( Ambion , Carlsbad , California ) , and siRNA _ CTTN _ 4 ( GGA CAAAGTGGATAAGAGC ) 21 ( MWG Biotech , Ebersberg , Germany ) . siRNA against firefly luciferase ( CTTACGCTGA GTACTTCGA ) ( Ambion ) was used as a control . Transient transfection was performed using two HNSCC cell lines HNO223 and HNO237 . A total of 5 × 10 5 cells were transfected by Nucleofector System ( Lonza , Köln , Germany ) according to manufacturer ’ s instructions and seeded into six well plates . RNA was isolated 48 hours after transfection using the RNeasy Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . 2 . 3 | Construction of a cortactin short hairpin RNA plasmid The DNA sequence of the siRNA _ CTTN _ 4 and siRNA luciferase was selected for the creation of the short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) plasmid and control plasmid . Based on the 19 - mer sequence of the siRNA , two complementary 60 - mer oligonucleotides , including a 9 bp loop separating the two target sequences , were generated and purchased from MWG - Biotech ( Ebersberg , Germany ) . Cloning was performed into the BgIII / HindIII restriction sites as described previously , 22 which was followed by transformation in Escherichia coli by isolation of plasmid DNA with a QIAprep Miniprep Kit ( Qiagen ) and Sanger sequencing . 2 . 4 | Stable transfection using shRNA Stable transfections of the pSUPERdL _ Zeo plasmid contain - ing cortactin and control shRNA were performed using Effectene Transfection Reagent ( Qiagen ) according to their standard protocol . 2686 HORN ET AL . 2 . 5 | RNA isolation , synthesis of cDNA , quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy Kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Synthesis of cDNA and quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) was performed as described previously . 23 2 . 6 | Proliferation assay Cell growth was measured by using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay ( Promega , Mannheim , Germany ) according to manufacturer ’ s recommendations . To confirm the data , a second proliferation assay , Cell Prolifera - tion ELISA , BrdU ( colorimetric ) ( Roche ) , was applied follow - ing its standard protocol . 2 . 7 | Migration and invasion assay Migration was measured using ThinCert 24 well cell culture inserts with 8 μ m pores ( Greiner BioOne GmbH , Frickenhausen , Germany ) . Invasion was investigated using BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers ( BD Biosciences , Bedford , Massachusetts ) . Fixed and stained cells were counted in five random fields by bright - field microscopy . 2 . 8 | Gene expression profiling and data analysis Gene expression profiling was performed using the Human GE 4x44K v2 Microarray ( Agilent ) according to manufac - turer ’ s instructions ( Agilent , Santa Clara , California ) . At two different time points , total RNA was extracted from stable transfected cell clones with knockdown of CTTN and the control . The quality of the RNA was determined by capillary electrophoresis using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent ) . Data were extracted and prepro - cessed by Agilent Feature Extraction Software Version 10 . 7 . Normalization and filtering were performed using the in - house - developed ChipYard analysis software ( http : / / www . dkfz . de / genetics / ChipYard / ) . Network analysis of the data was done by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) software ( www . ingenuity . com ) . 2 . 8 . 1 | Patient population The retrospective study cohort encompasses patients with primary OSCC that were treated by first - line surgery , including resection and elective cervical lymph node dissection ( level I - III ) ( Supporting Information Table S1 ) . We included all patients who were treated from September 2010 to February 2014 in our department according to the tumor board decision of the National Center for Tumor Diseases ( NCT ) in Heidelberg to guarantee a homogenous cohort for further analysis . In patients with lymph node metastases and / or histopathological risk , adjuvant radiation therapy was administered in accordance to the national guideline for OSCC . Tissue was harvested at the Department for Oral and Cranio - Maxillofacial Surgery of the Heidelberg University Hospital during surgery . The evaluation of the clinical follow - up of the patients was performed using data from the Department of Oral and Cranio - Maxillofacial Surgery . The Medical Ethics Commission of the University Hospital of Heidelberg provided the approval for this study ( Ethic votes : 206 / 2005 and 360 / 2011 ) . All experiments were done after written informed consent of the patients . 2 . 8 . 2 | Tissue microarray The tissue microarray ( TMA ) was prepared in a standardized manner . 24 For the present study , a TMA was prepared based on the above - mentioned OSCC cohort that was surgically treated according to the national guideline of OSCC from 2011 to 2015 . The TMAs were prepared by the tissue bank of the NCT in Heidelberg , Germany . The cohort was depicted in two TMAs with 9 × 12 cores and one TMA with 8 × 12 cores . Each patient was repre - sented by two different spots . In addition , each TMA had spots of healthy mucosa and muscular tissue to determine baseline staining . TMAs were constructed as described pre - viously . 24 In brief , paraffin donor blocks were analyzed on the basis of representative HE - stained sections and were validated by an experienced pathologist of the Institute of Pathology , University of Heidelberg . Small tissue cylinders with a diameter of 0 . 6 mm were taken out of the labeled tumor tissue using a tissue chip microarray ( Beecher Instru - ments , Silver Spring , Maryland ) . Afterward , these cylinders were transferred to a prepunched paraffin block , which was cut in 2 mm sections for further IHC . 2 . 9 | Immunohistochemistry IHC was performed using the mouse monoclonal antibody to cortactin ( Anti - Cortactin [ p80 / 85 ] Antibody , clone 4F11 ; Merck ; Darmstadt , Germany ) . Secondary antibody detection was performed using the DAKO Real Kit ( DAKO , Hamburg , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s proto - col . The scoring was performed independently by three experienced observers who were blinded toward patient char - acteristics and outcome . Each spot was evaluated according to the intensity of staining ( category A ) as well as percentage of cells stained ( category B ) . Category A documented the intensity of immunostaining as 1 ( no immunostaining ) to 4 ( strong immunostaining ) . Category B documented the percentage of immunoreactive cells as 1 ( none ) , 2 ( < 33 % ) , 3 ( 33 % - 66 % ) , and 4 ( > 66 % ) . The established scoring system was applied as previously described . 25 – 29 The score for each individual ranged from 1 to 16 and was calculated by multiplication of score A and B . Scores from 0 to 8 were combined in the CTTN low group . Cases with a score of more than 8 were summarized as CTTN high group . HORN ET AL . 2687 2 . 10 | Statistical analysis Box plot and Student ' s t tests were performed using Sigma Plot version 12 . 0 ( Systat Software Inc . , San Jose , California ) . SPSS statistical software version 20 ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , Illinois ) was used for survival distributions by the Kaplan - Meier method and log - rank testing . Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association between the CTTN score and overall survival ( OS ) as well as progression - free survival ( PFS ) together with clinical and histopathological covariates . P values < 0 . 05 were considered to be significant . 3 | RESULTS 3 . 1 | High expression of CTTN is present in HNSCC cell lines with amplification of 11q13 In a previous study , we determined the gene expression level of CTTN in 20 HNSCC cell using qRT - PCR . 15 We included an additional cell line and determined the gene expression level and protein expression level of CTTN . Overexpression of CTTN was detected in all cell lines with amplification in 11q13 ( Supporting Information Figure S1 ) . These data were confirmed by measuring the protein level of CTTN by Western blot ( Supporting Information Figure S2 ) . The highest rate of expression was identified in cell lines HNO223 and HNO237 ( Supporting Information Figure S1 ) . In addition , we identified these cell lines to be HPV negative by Multiplex HPV Genotyping testing ( see the Supplementary Materials and Methods section in Sup - porting Information ) . 3 . 2 | Knockdown of CTTN in non - HPV - related HNSCC cell lines results in less migration and invasion To address the role of CTTN in migration and invasion in non - HPV - related HNSCC , we performed knockdown exper - iments in HNSCC cell lines HNO223 and HNO237 . Transient transfection using different siRNAs significantly decreased the mRNA level of CTTN up to 90 % ( data not shown ) . siRNA _ CTTN _ 4 showed the highest knockdown and was therefore used for stable transfection . Transfected cells showed 50 % and 80 % decrease of expression , respec - tively , as measured by qRT - PCR and confirmed by Western blot analysis ( Figure 1 ) . In the next step , the effect of CTTN silencing on cell proliferation was assessed by the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay . In terms of proliferation , HNO223 cells with less CTTN expression showed less proliferation compared to mock controls . For HNO237 , however , no difference in proliferation was detected . Migration was investigated using the Boyden chamber assay with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) as chemoattractant . FIGURE 1 Stable knockdown of CTTN decreases mRNA and protein level in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cell lines . Knockdown of CTTN was performed by using a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) approach in two HNSCC cell lines with overexpression of CTTN ( HNO223 and HNO237 ) . Cells were stable transfected with shRNA against CTTN ( CTTN - 1 and CTTN - 2 ) or control ( Luci - 1 and Luci - 2 ) . CTTN mRNA level was verified by quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) ( A , B ) and protein level by Western blot ( C , D ) . CTTN expression showed 50 % ( HNO237 ) and 80 % ( HNO223 ) decrease 2688 HORN ET AL . A total of 1 × 10 5 cells were placed in the upper chamber . Migration was observed for 5 hours . Cells with stable silenc - ing of CTTN expression showed significantly lower migra - tion compared to mock controls ( Figure 2A , B ) . Migration potential was reduced by 80 % for HNO223 and approxi - mately 85 % for HNO237 . Invasion was investigated by the Boyden chamber assay with a coated Matrigel membrane . Again , EGF was used as a chemoattractant . Invasive charac - teristics of cells ( 1 × 10 5 ) were observed for 24 hours . In terms of HNO237 , the invasion was inhibited up to 50 % compared as compared to mock controls ( Figure 2C ) . HNO223 showed no invasive cells after 24 hours of incubation . 3 . 3 | High cortactin protein expression is associated with tumor size and lymph node metastases in OSCC To verify the clinical relevance , we assessed the role of CTTN expression in a large cohort of OSCC by IHC on a TMA based on 122 patients . Our major goal was to detect a potential association from CTTN with disease progres - sion ( tumor size and nodal status ) . Therefore , we per - formed a correlation analysis with CTTN and relevant clinical features ( Table 1 ) . High CTTN protein expression was associated with significantly more lymph node metas - tases ( Fisher ' s exact test ; P < 0 . 01 ) , as well as a higher tumor size ( Fisher ' s exact test ; P < 0 . 02 ) . As a conse - quence , high CTTN was likewise associated with higher tumor stages ( Fisher ' s exact test ; P < 0 . 01 ) . In view of all other clinical parameters ( age , sex , smoking , alcohol , and grading ; Fisher ' s exact test ; P > 0 . 05 ) no significant association was found ( Table 1 ) . FIGURE 2 Cells with stable knockdown of CTTN showed less migration and invasion compared to control . The migration potential of the cells was assessed by using the Boyden Chamber Assay . Results for A , HNO223 and B , HNO237 showed significant reduction of the number of migrated cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The effect of CTTN knockdown on the migration capability of HNSCC cells is shown in C . For HNO237 , decreased invasiveness was detected and shown in D [ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] TABLE 1 Correlation of clinical and molecular variables with CTTN Characteristics Low CTTN ( % ) High CTTN ( % ) P value Sex Female 25 20 Male 46 31 0 . 65 Tobacco Nonsmoking 30 19 Smoking / ex - smoking 31 11 0 . 78 Alcohol No / occasional 30 26 Yes / regular 31 16 0 . 43 Tumor size ( T ) T1 / 2 59 29 T3 / 4 12 22 0 . 02 * Lymph nodes ( N ) N negative 58 30 N positive 13 21 0 . 01 * Stage ( S ) I / II 50 19 III / IV 21 32 0 . 01 * Grading ( G ) G1 / 2 56 39 0 . 64 G3 12 11 Significant results of independent variables are marked with * . Fisher ' s exact test . HORN ET AL . 2689 3 . 4 | High cortactin expression is associated with reduced OS as well as PFS in OSCC Next , we analyzed the impact of CTTN expression on OS and PFS . In the first instance , we plotted survival data as a function of high and low CTTN expression and performed log - rank test to estimate significance . As a result , high CTTN expression was associated with worse OS ( log - rank test ; P < 0 . 01 ) and worse PFS ( log - rank test ; P < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 3 ) . High CTTN expression constitutes a risk factor for OS in univariate analysis ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 3 . 5 ; 95 % confi - dence interval [ CI ] : 1 . 6 - 7 . 9 ; P < 0 . 01 ) . Large tumor size ( HR : 2 . 0 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 9 - 4 . 4 ; P < 0 . 08 ) , positive lymph node status ( HR : 2 . 0 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 9 - 4 . 4 ; P < 0 . 08 ) , and high tumor stage ( HR : 2 . 0 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 0 - 4 . 3 ; P < 0 . 06 ) showed a ten - dency toward worse OS ( Table 2 ) . These results were clarified by multivariate testing , in which CTTN was con - firmed as the parameter with the strongest association to OS ( HR : 2 . 8 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 1 - 6 . 7 ; P < 0 . 02 ) . In total , multivariate model was calculated with 109 cases , due to missing data in the clinical records and histopathological analysis in terms of tobacco consumption and grading . All other parameters did not show any significant association with OS ( Table 2 ) . In terms of PFS , univariate analysis emphasized high CTTN expression ( HR : 2 . 8 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 2 - 6 . 4 ; P < 0 . 02 ) and lymph node status ( HR : 2 . 8 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 3 - 6 . 3 ; P < 0 . 01 ) as risk factors for worse SO . The parameter stage showed a ten - dency ( HR : 2 . 2 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 0 - 5 . 1 ; P = 0 . 05 ) to be a risk factor for disease progression . However , in the multivariate Cox regression model , CTTN expression proved to be the major risk factor for disease progression ( HR : 4 . 0 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 5 - 10 . 8 ; P < 0 . 02 ) , whereas lymph node metastases showed FIGURE 3 Survival plots ( Kaplan - Meier ) depending on CTTN expression .

Global gene expres - sion from cells with CTTN knockdown was analyzed and compared to mock controls . In total , eight different hybridizations were performed . The selection criteria comprised genes which were deregu - lated at least 1 . 5 - fold in five out of eight hybridizations . We found 226 deregulated genes ; upon CTTN silencing , 153 genes were downregulated and 73 genes were upregu - lated . The top 20 list of downregulated genes is shown in Table 3 ( complete list of deregulated genes is in Supporting Information Table S2 ) . Functional analysis by IPA software showed that CTTN silencing was associated with the suppres - sion of genes that are involved in cellular movement ( eg , CLDN4 , CTGF , FAP , INHBB , PODXL , and SFRP1 ) and cell death / survival ( eg , CDKN1C , NTN1 , SGSM1 , and TNF ) ( Table 3 ) . Upregulated genes mainly belonged to the cell death / survival group ( eg , CA9 , PTG2 , SOX2 , and TGM2 ) or were involved in cell to cell signaling ( eg , NCAM2 , PTN , and TGM2 ) ( Table 3 ) . We selected 21 genes involved in tumori - genesis from the top 40 list of deregulated genes and quantified their expression by qRT - PCR ( Figure 4 ) . Differen - tial expression patterns were confirmed for all selected candi - date genes . In addition , we analyzed the gene expression of our target genes in 10 primary HNSCC tumor samples by qRT - PCR , which revealed positive correlation of CTTN expression with three candidate genes ( MAF , MAFB , and PLAC2 ) ( Supporting Information Figure S3 ) . In summary , we could show functional association between CTTN expression , amplification of 11q13 , and the connection of CTTN expression with migration and invasion in HNSCC cell lines . Furthermore , we could link the func - tional results to the clinic by identifying high CTTN expres - sion as the major risk factor for OS and disease progression in a large cohort , which was treated homogeneously in accordance with the current national guideline for oral can - cer in Germany . In addition , we identified further potential targets for OSCC therapy . 4 | DISCUSSION In HNSCC , amplification of 11q13 is present in about 30 % of all tumors and correlates with poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis . 12 , 13 Freier et al showed that this amplicon is gene rich with a common minimal size of 1 . 7 Mb . 30 The gene CTTN is located inside this amplicon and is consistently over - expressed when amplification is present . Therefore , CTTN is thought to be an important candidate oncogene . 12 , 13 Lymph node metastases and locoregional recurrence are the major challenge in the successful long - term treatment of TABLE 3 Top 20 list of downregulated genes after knockdown of CTTN Symbol Name Fold change Biological function NTN1 Netrin 1 − 4 . 23 Cell migration PPP2R2C Protein phosphatase 2 , regulatory subunit B − 3 . 27 Cell growth , division TMPRSS11E2 Transmembrane protease , serine 11E − 3 . 17 Protease KLK5 Kallikrein - related peptidase 5 − 3 . 13 Cell shedding GPC4 Glypican 4 − 2 . 99 Cell growth , division DUSP23 Dual specificity phosphatase 23 − 2 . 93 Protein phosphatase MAF v - maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog ( avian ) − 2 . 91 Cell development , apoptosis GPNMB Glycoprotein ( transmembrane ) nmb − 2 . 90 Cell growth , metastasis EYA2 Eyes absent homolog 2 ( drosophila ) − 2 . 86 Development FAM155A Family with sequence similarity 155 , member A − 2 . 85 NA COL6A1 Collagen , type VI , α 1 − 2 . 82 Extracellular matrix , cell - binding protein SFRP1 Secreted frizzled - related protein 1 − 2 . 80 Wnt signaling PLAC2 / TINCR Placenta - specific 2 ( non - protein coding ) − 2 . 68 Non - protein - coding PLAC8 Placenta - specific 8 − 2 . 67 Cell differentiation INHBB Inhibin , beta B − 2 . 63 Cell proliferation , tumor suppressor KLK7 Kallikrein - related peptidase 7 − 2 . 52 Cell migration , invasion SASH1 SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 − 2 . 52 Tumor suppressor MAFB v - maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B ( avian ) − 2 . 48 Hematopoiesis ARHGAP22 Rho GTPase activating protein 22 − 2 . 47 Cell migration PODXL Podocalyxin - like 2 − 2 . 42 Cell adhesion , morphology HORN ET AL . 2691 HNSCC .

CTTN is involved in migra - tion and invasion in different types of cancer . 14 , 31 – 33 We used RNA interference to unravel the functional rela - tion of CTTN in HPV - negative HNSCC and could demon - strate that CTTN silencing decreases tumor cell motility and invasiveness in HNSCC cell lines . These results are in line with published studies , in which siRNA mediated downregu - lation of CTTN impaired tumor cell motility and invasion in different cancer types . 21 , 34 – 36 In Western countries , the consumption of tobacco and alcohol is the main risk factor for OSCC . 37 However , the rising incidence of carcinomas in the oropharynx without a parallel increase in tobacco and / or alcohol consumption led to the finding of HPV infection as a new major independent risk factor in OPSCC . 38 – 41 HPV - related OPSCC represents a distinct molecular entity with a distinct clinical behavior in terms of prognosis and radiosensitivity compared to non - HPV - related OPSCC . 38 – 41 Nevertheless , in classic HNSCC of the oral cavity ( OSCC ) further improvements in therapeu - tic management and prognosis are required . Therefore , we addressed the question whether CTTN is useful as a clinical marker in non - HPV - related OSCC . IHC experiments in 122 OSCC cases confirmed that CTTN is overexpressed in 51 ( 41 . 8 % ) patients . Rothschild et al found CTTN overexpression in 11 of 39 ( 28 % ) HNSCC patients , but the inhomogeneous HNSCC cohort and the small sample size slightly reduce the significance . 36 Liu et al examined a large OSCC cohort ( n = 122 ) and found high CTTN expres - sion in 65 out of 122 patients ( 53 % ) . 32 Hofman et al report of overexpression in 77 out of 176 tumors ( 44 % ) . 42 In addition , our findings in terms of survival analysis are in line with those of Hofman et al . 42 In contrast to their study , however , we were able show the impact of CTTN expression in a clean OSCC cohort with first - line surgery . In conjunction with the inhomogeneous HNSCC collective in terms of the impact of HPV , HNSCC patients should be stratified into its anatomical entities . In the study of Hofman et al , more than 75 % of the tumors were originated from the pharynx or the larynx . In addition , the patients in Hofman ' s study underwent different types of thera - pies . Historically , there have been treatment protocols using neoadjuvant chemotherapy for example . In both cohorts , CTTN overexpression showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastases , which is also in line with Liu et al . 32 In summary , our results allow to stratify high - risk patients immediately after surgery . Clinical aftercare can be adjusted to reduce radiation exposure in terms of diagnostic imaging for low - risk patients . For high - risk patients , clinical and diagnostic aftercare can be intensified . In terms of adjuvant targeted therapy , we performed gene expression profiling in order to elucidate possible path - ways and molecular targets involved in CTTN - regulated tumor progression . Functional annotation of the deregulated genes after CTTN silencing showed a downregulation of genes involved in migration and invasion of cells , for exam - ple , NTN1 , KLK - 7 , and FAP . Furthermore , we analyzed the expression of 20 genes from the top 40 list of deregulated FIGURE 4 Validation of microarray data by quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) . Twenty deregulated genes were selected and their expression validated by qRT - PCR . RNA was isolated at two different points in time 2692 HORN ET AL . genes in primary HNSCC and found a correlation between the expression of CTTN and three genes : PLAC2 ( TINCR ) , MAF , and MAFB . PLAC2 , also known as TINCR , codes for an uncharacterized long noncoding RNA located on chromo - some 19 . In terms of the function of PLAC2 , Kretz and col - leagues showed that PLAC2 controls human epidermal differentiation by a post - transcriptional mechanism . 43 How - ever , the function of PLAC2 in cancer , in particular in HNSCC , has not been analyzed yet . MAF and MAFB are transcription factors both acting as transcriptional activator or repressor . They belong to the AP1 superfamily of basic leucine zipper proteins , which also includes FOS and JUN . 44 MAF genes are overexpressed in 50 % of multiple myelomas . They have been described to deregulate cell cycle , cell migration , and cell to cell interactions through the induction of target genes ( ARK5 , CCND2 , and ITGB7 ) . However , their role in HNSCC has not been analyzed yet . Further functional studies are needed to explore the CTTN signaling network in detail and link bench to bedside . In conclusion , our results demonstrate that CTTN is involved in the progression of non - HPV - related OSCC . We could show that CTTN has an influence on migration and invasion in non - HPV - related HNSCC cell lines . Further - more , different deregulated genes involved in migration and invasion ( MAF , MAFB , and PLAC2 ) were identified as potential downstream targets of CTTN upon CTTN knock - down . The cortactin protein is overexpressed in 41 % of patients suffering from OSCC . CTTN correlates significantly with the presence of lymph node metastases . Therefore , we propose that CTTN is a useful clinical marker for risk stratification and that presents a potential target for future treatment strategies in node - positive OSCCs .
