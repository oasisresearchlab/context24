Relying on structuration theory for its development , the model overcomes some of the problematic dualisms of conventional approaches ( i . e . , subjecUobject , social / technical , abstract / concrete ) . According to the model , c o - m e m o r y ( f o r c o ll e c t i v e m e m o r y ) c on s i s t s o f r u l e s and r e s ou r c e s t ha t r e c u r s i v e l y m ed i a t e bo t h interactivity and structure in organizations . The model provides the basis for a taxonomy of existing and projected IT - based co - memory systems . Four classes of co - memory systems are described : transactional , managerial , strategic , and team . An analysis of driving trends concerning people , structure , and technology is used to project four scenarios for organizations in 2001 : bureaucracy , factory , affiliation , and infocracy . Co - memory systems that can be expected in each scenario are discussed . Predictions indicate that a mnemonic sh < / 1 is occurring in which society is moving toward discursive organizational forms that will increasingly rely on IT - based co - memory . The paper concludes with a number of research questions designed to foster fu rther research on the relationship between information systems and organizational memory . 1 .

On Thus , the activity of human beings is an essential part of the other hand , sociologists and organizational behaviorists structuration theory .

According to Thus , it is important to avoid the temptation either to Giddens , " routine practices are the prime expression of the conceive of memory as an information processing mecha - duality of structure in respect of the continuity of social nism or to reduce complex social phenomena to the " sin - life " ( 1984 , p . 282 ) . gte - minded " view of cognitive psychology .

Perhaps a interpretations of consciousness , routinization , and regional - more compelling reason for the affinity is that both IS and ization to describe some of the complex processes of structuration theory are " bridges " - the discipline of IS organizational remembering and forgetting . bridges technical and social worlds , economics and politics , while structuration theory bridges many of the underlying In essence , co - memory is a framework of mutual under - concerns of our discipline ( e . g . , agency versus structure , standing through which knowledgeable human agents main - material versus social , etc . ) . tain temporal and spatial continuity .

He tells us that , when trying to understand a particular In structurationist terms , co - memory has two key attributes : phenomenon , it is not sufficient to seek explanation solely in the motivations of individuals on the one hand , or in the • Co - memory is a modality of structuration . constraints imposed upon those individuals by social struc - tures on the other hand . Understanding , says Giddens , · Co - memory consists of rules and resources . comes from a perspective that acknowledges the interrela - tionship of the two . Structuration theory is an attempt to As a modality of structuration , co - memory constrains and provide such a perspective . enables interactivity and is both a medium and an outcome of this interactivity . At the same time , co - memory is According to Giddens , structure can be conceived of as recursively implicated in the reproduction of structure . properties . These properties allow the " binding " of time - Figure 2 locates co - memory within the duality of structure . 129 For Giddens , resources fall into two categories : allocative STRUCTURE and au t ho r i t a t i v e .

A number of other functions in Table 2 are almost the STRUCTURE opposite of those related to transactional co - memory . They include group authorship , tracking / auditing and version control . These functions became sophisticated and prevalent with the introduction of information technology . They are effortful , non - routine and commonly depend on and support transactional co - memory . They are composed of shallow , discursive , and formalized rules and may be either weakly or strongly sanctioned in organizations . They TECHNOLOGY are primarily resources for coordination .
