Our protein - protein interaction screen of TRIM15 with the integrin adhesome identi ﬁ ed several TRIM15 interacting proteins including coronin 1B , cortactin , ﬁ lamin binding LIM protein1 , and vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein , which are involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics . TRIM15 expression was tissue - restricted and downregulated in colon cancer . Level of TRIM15 expression was associated with colon cancer cell migration , as well as both in vitro and in vivo tumor growth . These data provide novel insights into the role of TRIM15 as an additional component of the integrin adhesome , regulating cell migration , and suggest that TRIM15 may function as a tumor suppressor of colon cancer . © 2014 Elsevier B .

Introduction The tripartite motif containing ( TRIM ) protein family is character - ized by the presence of three distinct motifs in the N - terminal region : a really interesting new gene ( RING ) domain , and one or two B - box do - mains , and a coiled - coil domain [ 1 ] . Given the high conservation of the order of these domains in the TRIM protein family members , the TRIM proteins are also known as RBCC proteins . Humans have more than 60 TRIM proteins , which are classi ﬁ ed into 11 subgroups based on the do - main composition of the C - terminal region [ 2 – 4 ] . Ten different types of C - terminaldomainsexistinTRIM familymembers , namely theCOS box , ﬁ bronectin type 3 , PRY / SPRY , plant homeodomain , bromodomain , NHL , ﬁ lamin - type immunoglobulin , ADP ribosylation factor - like , MATH , and transmembrane domains . The most common C - terminal domain of TRIM proteins is the PRY / SPRY domain . Among the identi ﬁ ed TRIM pro - teins , 34 members of the TRIM protein family contain a SPRY domain or a fusion of a PRY and SPRY domain [ 3 , 4 ] . Although many TRIM proteins play well - known roles in innate immunity by interfering with the viral replication cycle and regulating immune signaling pathways , TRIM pro - teins have also been implicated in diverse cellular processes , including cell differentiation , apoptosis , and transcriptional regulation [ 3 – 6 ] . TRIM15 , also known as RNF93 or ZNFB7 , contains a PRY / SPRY do - mainintheC - terminalregion . Arecentstudyproposed TRIM15 as acan - didate gene for diagnosing gastric cancer , because DNA methylation levels of TRIM15 were higher in gastric cancer tissues than in normal gastrictissues [ 7 ] . TRIM15mRNAexpressionwas downregulatedingas - triccancer , suggestingthat lower TRIM15 expression maybe involved in development of gastric cancer . Inother studies , TRIM15 wasreported as a restriction factor for the murine leukemia virus and human immuno - de ﬁ ciency virus 1 by interacting with the retroviral Gag protein and inhibiting viral release [ 6 ] . Despite these interesting ﬁ ndings , little is known about the functional roles and tissue expression patterns of TRIM15 . In addition , TRIM15 may be associated with other disease states .

We foundTRIM15to beacell - extracellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion component that interacted with several regula - tors involved in actin dynamics , ultimately suppressing cell migration . Furthermore , we demonstrated that TRIM15 was highly expressed in normal human colon tissues , and its expression was diminished in colon adenocarcinoma . Restoring expression of TRIM15 in colon cancer cells reduced tumor growth in mice , suggesting an important role for TRIM15 in suppression of cellular transformation . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Plasmids The pDONR223 vector that encoded TRIM15 was obtained from the human ORFeome v3 . 1 ( Open Biosystems , Lafayette , CO , USA ) . Using Gateway recombination ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , the TRIM15 was transferred into destination vectors to tag TRIM15 with N - terminal half yellow ﬂ uorescence protein ( YFPn ; pBabe - CMV - TRIM15 - YFPn - neo ) , C - terminal half yellow ﬂ uorescence protein ( YFPc ; pCl - CMV - TRIM15 - YFPc - puro ) , glutathione S - transferase ( GST ; pDEST27 - TRIM15 ) , or FLAG ( pCl - CMV - 2xFLAG - TRIM15 - puro ) [ 8 ] . The DNA fragments encoding TRIM15 deletion mutants were generated by PCR , cloned into the pENTR / D - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) , and transferred into pCl - CMV - 2xFLAG - DEST - puro vector using Gateway recombination . 2 . 2 . Cell cultures U2OS and 293T cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco ' s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM ) , HCT116 , HT - 29 , and LOVO cells were cultured in RPMI medium , and CCD18Co cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium . The media for all the cells were supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 units / ml penicillin , and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin . To establish cells that stably expressed vector or FLAG - TRIM15 , empty pCl - CMV - 2xFLAG - puro vector [ 8 ] or the pCl - CMV - 2xFLAG - TRIM15 - puro vector was co - transfected with pCl - Ampho vector into 293T cells . After 2 days , U2OS , HCT116 , or HT - 29 cells were infected with the collected retroviral supernatants from the 293T cells and treated with 1 μ g / ml puromycin for more than 10 days . To stimulate cells with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , HCT116 cells stably expressing vector or FLAG - TRIM15 were serum - starved for 24 h and treated with 50 ng / ml of human recombinant EGF ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) for the indicated time . For knockdown experiments , TRIM15 and CTTN siRNAs were obtained from Bioneer ( Seoul , Korea ) and transfected into LOVO or U2OS cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Invitrogen ) . The sequence of CTTN siRNA was 5 ′ - GGAACUUGAAACAGGACCA - 3 ′ . The sequences for the TRIM15 siRNAs were the following : siRNA1 ( 5 ′ - AGCAGGCAGAGACU CCCAU - 3 ′ ) and siRNA2 ( 5 ′ - CCCAAUCCUCGGGCAAGAU - 3 ′ ) . 2 . 3 . Antibodies The following antibodies were used for the immunoblotting ex - periments : anti - FLAG M2 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , anti - GST ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , UK ) , anti - phospho - cortactin ( Tyr421 ) , anti - cortactin ( Cell Signaling Technology Inc . , Danvers , MA , USA ) , and anti - β - actin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) antibodies . A rab - bit polyclonal antibody against theTRIM15wasgenerated by Abfrontier ( Seoul , Korea ) by immunizing rabbits with the keyhole - limpet hemocyanin - conjugated synthetic peptides C - EQQIWKERDEYITK and C - SEDRKSVRYTRQKKS that correspond to the amino acid residues 195 - 208 and 310 - 324 of the human TRIM15 , respectively . The anti - TRIM15 antibody was af ﬁ nity - puri ﬁ ed , and the speci ﬁ city of the anti - body was validated . Anti - TRIM15 antibody was applicable to Western blotting and immunohistochemistry , but not to immunoprecipitation ( Fig . S1 ) . 2 . 4 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence Cells were cultured on 12 mm glass coverslips and ﬁ xed with 3 % paraformaldehyde / 2 % sucrose in phosphate buffered saline for 10 minute ( min ) at room temperature . The cells permeabilized with Triton X - 100 buffer ( 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 20 mM Hepes - KOH , pH7 . 9 , 50 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl2 , and 300 mM sucrose ) were incubated with the rabbit anti - FLAG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and mouse anti - vinculin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) antibodies for 1 hour ( h ) at room temperature . After washing , the cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti - mouse antibody ( Invitrogen ) , a Rhodamine Red - X conjugated anti - rabbit antibody ( Invitrogen ) , and an Alexa Fluor 633 conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) for 1 h at room temperature . The cells were mounted with the ProLong antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) containing 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) . The images were captured with an inverted LSM700 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Oberkochen , Germany ) . 2 . 5 . Transwell migration assay Migration assay was performed according to a previously described method [ 9 ] . Brie ﬂ y , bottom surfaces of ﬁ lters with an 8 μ m pore diame - ter were coated with 10 μ g / ml ﬁ bronectin . Cells ( 2 × 10 5 ) were suspended in 100 μ l of DMEM containing 1 mg / ml of bovine serum albumin and added to upper chamber of a transwell ( Corning Costar , Corning , NY , USA ) . The lower compartments of the transwell chambers were ﬁ lledwith600 μ lofDMEMcontaining10 % FBS . Afteranincubation at 37 °C , the migrated cells were ﬁ xed and stained with hematoxylin . Incubation time was optimized for each cell types ( U2OS cells for 7 h , HCT116cellsfor1 day , HT - 29 andLOVOcellsfor2days ) . Afterremoving cells that did not migrate , migration was quanti ﬁ ed by counting the cells that migrated through pores . Eight independent ﬁ elds were counted under a microscope ( 200× magni ﬁ cation ) ( Carl Zeiss ) . The re - sults were expressed as a percentage of control cells . 2 . 6 . Fluorescent protein complementation assay Fluorescent protein complementation assay was performed as pre - viously described [ 8 ] . Brie ﬂ y , the pBabe - CMV - TRIM15 - YFPn - neo and pCl - Ampho vectors were co - transfected into 293T cells for retrovirus production and subsequentinfection of HTC75 cells . Thebait cells stably expressing TRIM15 conjugated with YFPn were selected by treatment with 300 μ g / ml G418 . To screen the TRIM15 binding proteins with integrin adhesome proteins ( www . adhesome . org ) [ 10 ] , 127 of avail - able integrin adhesome proteins were selected from our previous high - throughput protein complementation array screen system and reconstituted into 96 well plates ( Fig . S2 ) . Individual clone of YFPc - adhesome proteins with pCl - Ampho were then co - transfected into 293Tcellstogenerateretroviruses . Retroviralsupernatantwascollected at 48 h post - transfection . The TRIM15 bait cells were seeded onto 24 - well plates and infected with the retrovirus encoding a YFPc - tagged integrin adhesome protein . At 2 days following the infection , cells were selected with 1 μ g / ml of puromycin for 10 days . Cells were then harvested for ﬂ ow cytometry analysis using the LSRII ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) . According to data of our previous complementation assay , we considered the nonspeci ﬁ c signals for com - plementation assay by 6 . 37 ± 3 . 66 % YFP positives [ 8 ] . The identi ﬁ ed proteins were analyzed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program ( Redwood City , CA , USA ) to determine network and function . 2 . 7 . Co - precipitation and immunoblotting TheindicatedgeneswereclonedintoeitherpDEST27 ( Invitrogen ) to tag with GST or pCl - CMV - 2xFLAG - DEST - puro for FLAG . The indicated plasmids were co - transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . The transfected cells were harvested 2 days after 410 O . - H . Lee et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1853 ( 2015 ) 409 – 421 transfection and lysed in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 4 , 137 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mM EDTA ) . The pre - cleared cell lysateswereincubatedwithglutathioneagarosebeads ( BDBiosciences ) or anti - FLAG M2 agarose beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at 4 °C . After washing , the bound proteinswere analyzed bySDS - PAGE and immuno - blotting . The immunoreactive bands were detected by chemilumines - cence using the ECL reagents ( GE Healthcare ) . 2 . 8 . Analysis of TRIM15 mRNA Total RNAs from cell lines were isolated by using an RNeasy Plus kit ( Qiagen Inc . , Valencia , CA , USA ) and converted to cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) . Human MTC panel I / II and the human colon matched cDNA pair panel were ob - tained from Clontech ( Mountain View , CA , USA ) . For the conventional RT - PCR , TRIM15 PCR products were generated by PCR ampli ﬁ cation from2 . 5 μ lofcDNAtemplateinatotalvolumeof25 μ lusingtheCheetah Hot - Start Taq polymerase ( Biotium , Inc . Hayward , CA , USA ) . The primers used for the conventional RT - PCR were as follows : TRIM15 ( 5 ′ - GGCCATTCAGCCCTACCGGG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GACTCTGACATCTTGTAGAA GCTC - 3 ′ ) and β - actin ( 5 ′ - ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC - 3 ′ ) . Quantitative real - time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green reagent ( Roche ap - plied Science , Germany ) and a LightCycler 480 System ( Roche applied Science ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The primers used for the quantitative real - time PCR were as follows : TRIM15 ( 5 ′ - GCCCGCTGGGAGAAACTTAC - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGCATCGTTCTCGCAGAAG - 3 ′ ) and 18S rRNA ( 5 ′ - CGAACGTCTGCCCTATCAACTT - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - ACCCGTGG TCACCATGGTA - 3 ′ ) . The PCR reactions were performed in triplicate , and the relative expression level of TRIM15 mRNA was normalized to the 18S rRNA level using the comparative C T ( ΔΔ C T ) method [ 11 ] . 2 . 9 . Immunohistochemistry A tissue microarray ( A303 I ) composed of 32 normal and colon can - cer tissues was purchased from ISU ABXIS Co . , LTD ( Seoul , Korea ) . The tissuemicroarray was rehydrated andprocessed in10 mMcitratebuffer ( pH6 . 0 ) forantigenretrieval . Afterblockingfor1hatroomtemperature withablockingsolutioncontaining5 % skimmilkand1 % BSA , thetissues were incubated with the anti - TRIM15 antibody ( 1 : 500 ) at 4 °C over - night . The tissues were further processed with an avidin - biotin - horseradish peroxidase complex ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA , USA ) . Theperoxidasesignals weredeveloped witha0 . 01 % 3 , 3 ′ - diaminobenzi - dine solution ( Vector Labs ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol and counterstained with hematoxylin . The images were obtained with an Axio microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) 2 . 10 . Soft agar assay for colony formation HCT116 and HT - 29 cells stably expressing vector or FLAG - TRIM15 were suspended in 0 . 3 % agarose in complete medium and plated onto a layer of 0 . 6 % agarose in complete medium in 6 - well plates ( 1 × 10 4 cells / well ) . Colonies were allowed to grow for 25 – 30days in thegrowth medium . The colonies were stained with 3 - [ 4 , 5 - dimethyl - 2 - thiazolyl ] - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide and photographed . The number of colonies was counted by blind observers . 2 . 11 . Xenotransplantation assay All animal experiments were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Cancer Center in Korea . HT - 29 cells ex - pressingvectorcontrolorFLAG - TRIM15 ( 3 . 5×10 6 cells / spot ) weresub - cutaneously injected into the left ﬂ ank region of 6 weeks old female nude mice ( n = 9 / group ) . Tumor volumes were measured usingcaliper and determined by a formula [ volume = ( length × width 2 ) / 2 ] from day 6 to day 22 following injection of cancer cells . The results were expressed as mean tumor volumes with SD . 2 . 12 . Statistical analysis The data are presented as the mean ± SD , and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistics package for Windows ( Version 20 . 0 , IBM Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . The statistical signi ﬁ cance of the com - parisons was evaluated by the Student ' s t - testfor independentsamples . For all analyses , a p b 0 . 05 was considered to be statistically signi ﬁ cant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . TRIM15 is localized to cell - ECM adhesions Despite signi ﬁ cant sequence and structural similarity , the TRIM pro - tein family members have a variety of different subcellular localizations [ 1 ] , which suggests that these proteins have diverse and unique func - tional activities . To understand the molecular and cellular functions of TRIM15 , we examined subcellular localization of TRIM15 in living cells using GFP . The majority of TRIM15 - GFP was accumulated in small streaks ( Fig . 1A ) . To eliminate tagging effect of GFP on the speci ﬁ c localization pattern of TRIM15 , we generated stable cells that expressed FLAG - tagged TRIM15 and stained the cells with an anti - FLAG antibody and phalloidin . Confocal microscopy revealed that TRIM15 was clus - tered at cell - ECM adhesion sites where focal complexes were formed as well as focal adhesions where the actin stress ﬁ bers were anchored ( Fig . 1B ) . To con ﬁ rm that TRIM15 localized to focal complexes or focal adhe - sions , the cells stably expressing FLAG - TRIM15 were stained with the antibody that speci ﬁ cally recognized vinculin , a component of focal complexes or focal adhesions . The results showed that TRIM15 completely co - localized with vinculin ( Fig . 1C ) . Because vinculin is also a component of cell - cell junctions [ 12 ] , we tested whether TRIM15 functions at cell - cell contacts in con ﬂ uent cells using co - staining with an antibody against tight junction marker ZO - 1 . TRIM15 was not associated with cell - cell adhesion sites where a tight junction is enriched ( Fig . 1D ) . Taken together , the data indicated that TRIM15 is a component that links the membrane and cytoskeletons in sites of cell - ECM adhesions . 3 . 2 . TRIM15 homo - dimerizes through its coiled - coil domain TRIM protein family members are known to homo - dimerize [ 1 ] . We performed a ﬂ uorescent protein complementation assay in live cells to directly investigate whether TRIM15 homo - dimerized [ 8 , 13 , 14 ] . Homo - dimerization of TRIM15 was detected by the presence of YFP ﬂ uorescence using ﬂ ow cytometry ( Fig . 2A ) . To con ﬁ rm the homo - dimerization of TRIM15 biochemically , vectors encoding FLAG - tagged and GST - tagged TRIM15 were co - transfected into 293T cells . Consistent with the protein complementation assay , co - immunoprecipitation and GST pull down assays demonstrated that TRIM15 was readily detected as a homo - dimer ( Fig . 2C ) . To determine which domains are responsible for TRIM15 dimeriza - tion , we generated FLAG - tagged TRIM15 deletion mutations that lacked individual domains or a combination of domains ( Fig . 2B ) . 293T cells were co - transfected with GST - tagged TRIM15 and FLAG - tagged TRIM15 deletion mutants . A GST - pull down assay demonstrated that the coiled - coil domain is required for the dimerization of TRIM15 ( Fig . 2D ) . 3 . 3 . The B - box2 and PRY domains are necessary for TRIM15 localization to focal adhesions and TRIM15 - induced inhibition of cell migration To test which domains were involved in the subcellular localization of the TRIM15 , we generated stable cell lines expressing TRIM15 dele - tion mutants . The Δ RING or Δ SPRY mutants were still recruited to the 411 O . - H . Lee et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1853 ( 2015 ) 409 – 421 focal adhesion sites and co - localized with vinculin . Mutants with dele - tion of the B - box2 or PRY domains , however , failed to localize to the focal adhesion sites and were diffused throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus with no disruption of vinculin localization to the focal adhesion sites ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Moreover , the disruption of the PRY region of TRIM15 led to the localization of TRIM15 with ﬁ brillar actin in the cytoplasm . Together , these results suggest that the region of TRIM15 from B - box2 domain through the PRY domain plays an important role in localizing TRIM15 to focal adhesion . Cell migration and adhesion are coordinated by a complex of pro - teins that localize to sites of focal adhesion . To investigate whether TRIM15 is involved in theregulation of cellularmigration , we compared the motility of cells that stably expressed TRIM15 to a vector control using the transwell migration assay . The results showed that TRIM15 - expressing cells migrated remarkably slower than the vector control cells ( Fig . 3C ) . Despite this difference , there was no change in cell adhe - sion to the ECM between TRIM15 stable cells and control cells , assessed by monitoring adhesion to laminin and ﬁ bronectin ( Fig . S3 ) . To address Fig . 1 . The subcellular localization of TRIM15 . A ) The localization of GFP - tagged TRIM15 was observed in live U2OS cells stably expressing TRIM15 - GFP under a ﬂ uorescent microscope . Hoechst 33342 was used to stain the nuclei of the live cells . The scale bar indicates 10 μ m . B ) U2OS cells stably expressing FLAG - TRIM15 were stained with phalloidin and an anti - FLAG antibody to detect F - actin and TRIM15 , respectively .

The homo - dimerization of TRIM15 through its coiled - coil domain . A ) A ﬂ uorescent protein complementation assay was used to determine the level of TRIM15 dimerization . A Venus YFP N - terminal fragment tagged TRIM15 ( TRIM15 - YFPn ) was co - expressed with a YFP C - terminal fragment ( YFPc ) alone or a YFPc - tagged TRIM15 in U2OS cells . The per - centage of YFP - positive cells was measured by ﬂ ow cytometry . B ) A schematic representation of the deletion mutants of TRIM15 used in this study is shown . Δ RING , Δ RING / BB , Δ RING / BB / CC , Δ SPRY , and Δ PRY / SPRY TRIM15 correspond to the amino acid ( aa ) 70 - 465 , aa 122 - 465 , aa 247 - 465 , aa 1 - 377 , and aa 1 - 240 , respectively . C ) A biochemical analysis of the level of TRIM15 dimerization . 293T cells were co - transfected with plasmids encoding GST or GST - TRIM15 with or without FLAG - TRIM15 . The FLAG - TRIM15 was immunoprecipitated using an anti - FLAG antibody , or GST - TRIM15 was precipitated using glutathione agarose beads . The level of TRIM15 dimerization was determined by im - munoblotting with the anti - FLAG or anti - GST antibodies . D ) TRIM15 protein without the coiled - coil domain does not interact with the full - length TRIM15 protein . 293T cells were co - transfected with GST - TRIM15 and the indicated FLAG - TRIM15 deletion mutant . GST - TRIM15 was bound by glutathione agarose beads . The co - precipitated amounts of the FLAG - TRIM15 mutants were visualized by immunoblotting with an anti - FLAG antibody . The same membrane was stripped and re - blotted with an anti - GST antibody . Input contains 1 % of the cell lysates . 413 O . - H .

A ) U2OS cells stably expressing FLAG - tagged full length TRIM15 or one of the TRIM15 deletion mutants were ﬁ xed and stained with phalloidin , as well as anti - FLAG and anti - vinculin antibodies .

The experiments were per - formed in triplicate . The mean percentage of migration was obtained from three independent experiments . * p b 0 . 05 versus vector control cells ; # p b 0 . 05 versus wild type TRIM15 cells . 414 O . - H . Lee et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1853 ( 2015 ) 409 – 421 whichdomainsofTRIM15wereessentialfortheinhibitionofcellmigra - tion , we examined the effects of the TRIM15 deletion mutants on cellu - lar migration . Consistent with their loss of localizations to focal adhesions , the TRIM15 Δ RING / BB and Δ PRY / SPRY mutants could not signi ﬁ cantly inhibit cell migration , indicating that the localization of TRIM15 to focal adhesion is important for the inhibition of cellular migration ( Fig . 3C , D ) . 3 . 4 . TRIM15 interacts with regulators of actin dynamics Cell - ECM adhesions are mediated by integrin and composed of multi - protein complexes that link the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton . According to an in silico study , these adhesion complexes , known as the integrin adhesome , are composed of 180 protein components [ 10 ] . Previously , we established a high - throughput arrayed screening system based on protein complementation to systematically investigate protein - protein interactions in live human cells [ 8 ] . We picked 127 vectors that encoded integrin adhesome proteins and attempted to identify which of these interacted with TRIM15 using a ﬂ uorescence protein complementation assay ( Fig . S2 ) . We identi ﬁ ed 25 potential TRIM15 - interacting proteins ( Table S1 ) . To con ﬁ rm these results , we tagged the 25 proteins with a FLAG tag , co - expressed them individually with GST - tagged TRIM15 in 293T cells , and performed GST pull down assay . By this method , TRIM15 interacted with several adaptors or scaffold proteins for actin cytoskeleton dynamics , including coronin 1B ( CORO1B ) , cortactin ( CTTN ) , ﬁ lamin binding LIM protein1 ( FBLIM1 ) , and vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) ( Fig . 4A , B , C ) . TRIM15 also associated with AKT1 and SRC , kinases that regulate protein activity by phosphorylation , and NCK2 and CRK , SH2 and SH3 - containting adaptors that recruit several signaling molecules ( Fig . S4 ) . CTTNplaysacriticalroleincellmotilitybyregulatingactindynamics . To check whether TRIM15 can interact with native CTTN , we carried out co - immunoprecipitation assay . Because our anti - TRIM15 antibody was inef ﬁ cient to immunoprecipitate TRIM15 ( Fig . S1 ) , FLAG - TRIM15 in U2OS cells stably expressing FLAG - TRIM15 was immunoprecipitated using anti - FLAG antibody . As shown in Fig . 5A , a signi ﬁ cant binding signal of native CTTN with FLAG - TRIM15 was observed . Examination of the localization of TRIM15 and CTTNby immuno ﬂ uorescence showed that TRIM15 and CTTN were co - localized to the leading edge of the cell membrane where cell - ECM adhesions are abundant ( Fig . 5B ) . Next , we analyzed the effect of TRIM15 on CTTN tyrosine phosphorylation , because the tyrosine phosphorylation status of CTTN correlates with de - polymerization and destabilization of actin ﬁ laments , which allows cell movement [ 15 ] . Since EGF is known to stimulate CTTN tyrosine phosphorylation [ 16 ] , cells were treated with EGF . As shown in Fig . 5C , EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of CTTN in control cells in a rapid and sustained manner . However , we did not observe EGF - induced CTTN phosphorylation in cells stably expressing TRIM15 . Next , we investigatedthe roleof CTTN in TRIM15localization to cell - ECM adhesion sites and inhibition of cell motility by TRIM15 . Knock - down of CTTN by siRNA treatment did not alter TRIM15 localization to focal adhesion , implying that the recruitment of TRIM15 to focal com - plexes or focal adhesions was in CTTN - independent manner ( Fig . S5 ) . The effect of CTTN on the cell motility was in ﬂ uenced by the level of TRIM15 . Knockdown of CTTN expression negatively regulated motility of control U2OS cells that contained lower level of phosphorylated CTTN in quiescent status , compared to U2OS cells stably expressing TRIM15 . Knockdown of CTTN in TRIM15 - expressing cells did not de - crease cell motility , whereas motility was slightly enhanced by CTTN siRNA ( Fig . 5D , E ) . These results were similar to the data demonstrating that CTTN had dual function in regulating cell motility . Negative or positive effect of CTTN on cell migration depended on its phosphoryla - tion status [ 17 ] . Taken together , these results suggest that TRIM15 may inhibit cell migration by impairing signal - dependent phosphoryla - tion of CTTN . 3 . 5 . Expression of TRIM15 in normal human tissues We wanted to investigate the expression pattern of TRIM15 in nor - mal tissues . TRIM15 mRNA was highly expressed in the kidney and colon tissues and slightly expressed in the liver and small intestine . TRIM15 mRNA was not detectable or very minimally expressed in the heart , brain , placenta , lung , skeletal muscle , pancreas , spleen , thymus , prostate , testis , ovary and leukocytes ( Fig . 6A ) . In normal human colon tissues , TRIM15 was highly expressed in the differentiated epithelial cells located in the upper portion of human colon crypts . Notably , TRIM15 staining was predominant in the surface epithelium as compared to the lower regions of the crypts ( Fig . 6B ) . Consistent with the TRIM15 protein expression pattern in the colon tis - sue sections , TRIM15 mRNA was also observed in several colon epithe - lial cell lines , HCT116 , HT - 29 , and LOVO cells , but not in CCD18Co , a colon ﬁ broblast cell line ( Fig . 6C , D ) . Taken together , these results sug - gest that TRIM15 expression is tightly regulated in a tissue - speci ﬁ c manner , and expression of TRIM15 may associate with the epithelial function of the colon mucosa . 3 . 6 . TRIM15 as a negative regulator of cell motility in colon epithelial cells Next , we examined whether the expression of TRIM15 affected the motility of the colon epithelial cells . HCT116 and HT - 29 cells that con - taining low levels of TRIM15 mRNA were infected with a retrovirus that encoding FLAG - tagged TRIM15 ( Fig . 7A ) . As expected , the overex - pression of TRIM15 signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the migration of HCT116 and HT - 29 cells ( Fig . 7B ) . To con ﬁ rm the negative role of TRIM15 in colon epithelial cell migration , we assessed the impact of suppressing TRIM15 expression by siRNA treatment on the migration of LOVO colon cancer cells , which demonstrated a higher basal expression of TRIM15 than the other cell lines tested ( Fig . 7C ) . We found that the siRNA - mediated inhibition of TRIM15 expression enhanced the migra - tion of the LOVO cells ( Fig . 7D ) . Taken together , our data suggest that TRIM15 negatively regulates cell migration of colon epithelial cells . 3 . 7 . TRIM15 expression is downregulated in colon adenocarcinoma and the level of TRIM15 expression affects tumor growth To examine whether TRIM15 expression is altered in colon ade - nocarcinomas , which acquire higher cellular motility , we performed RT - PCR on cDNAs obtained from 5 patients with colorectal tumors ( Fig . 8A , B ) . Notably , the expression of TRIM15 mRNA was suppressed in most of colon cancer patient samples . Using immunohistochemistry , we found that the strong TRIM15 signals observed in the normal colon epithelium were dramatically reduced in the colon adenocarcinoma samples ( Fig . 8C ) . Thereduced expression of TRIM15 in colonadenocar - cinoma suggested that TRIM15 might normally prevent cancer progres - sion . To investigate this hypothesis , we assessed the effect of stable TRIM15 expression in HCT116 and HT - 29 cells on colonogenicity . The HCT116and HT - 29cells that expressed thevector aloneformednumer - ous colonies in soft agar ; however , the TRIM15 - expressing cells had signi ﬁ cantly fewer colonies in soft agar ( Fig . 8D ) . Next , we examined theeffectof TRIM15on tumor growth in vivo . Tothis end , we inoculated nude mice subcutaneously with HT - 29 cells stably expressing TRIM15 or control HT - 29 cells . Although tumors formed in both groups , the growthoftumorsderivedfromcellsexpressingTRIM15wassigni ﬁ cant - ly suppressed ( Fig . 8E ) . Together , these results support the possibility that downregulation of TRIM15 might promote the progression of colon adenocarcinoma by increasing cellular migration and growth of colon cancer cells . 4 . Discussion Cell - ECM adhesion is a primary site of force transmission between the cell and the ECM and is mostly mediated by integrins in the cell 415 O . - H . Lee et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1853 ( 2015 ) 409 – 421 membrane . Integrin ligation to the ECM triggers a conformational change of integrins , which promotes their linkage to the actin cytoskel - eton through multi - protein complexes [ 18 , 19 ] . The network of protein interactionsbetweenthemulti - proteincomplexescomprisesstructures termed focal contacts or focal adhesions . The molecular composition of focal adhesions dictates cellular behaviors such as migration . Our Fig . 4 . TRIM15interactswithknownregulatorsofactindynamics .

Lee et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1853 ( 2015 ) 409 – 421 microscopic analysis indicated that TRIM15 was prominently enriched in focal contacts or focal adhesions . Since TRIM15 contains a coiled - coil domain , which mediates both homo - and hetero - dimeric interac - tions as well as higher - order multimer interactions [ 1 , 20 ] , TRIM15 may homo - multimerize into high molecular weight complexes and play a role as a scaffolding protein to recruit speci ﬁ c signaling proteins to cell - ECM adhesion sites toregulatecell motility . TRIMfamily proteins containing PRY / SPRY domain acquire antibody - like architectures which are able to bind targets ranging from small molecules and peptide epi - topes provided by proteins [ 21 ] . The PRY / SPRY domain of TRIM15 may confer target - binding speci ﬁ city to TRIM15 . Disruption of the PRY / SPRY regions was associated with diffuse localization of TRIM15 in cells and the loss of inhibition of TRIM15 in cell migration , suggesting that speci ﬁ c protein interactions through the PRY / SPRY domain was essential for the function of TRIM15 . Our results show that the RING domain in TRIM15 is not necessary for either TRIM15 localization to focal adhesion or the inhibitory effect on cell migration . RING domains are known to play a critical role in me - diating the transfer of ubiquitin to speci ﬁ c substrates . Therefore , this domain is a distinct feature of many E3 ubiquitin ligases . In fact , many Fig . 6 . ExpressionofTRIM15 . A ) ThedistributionofTRIM15expressioninhumantissues . TheexpressionofTRIM15mRNAwasanalyzedinnormalhumantissuesusingreal - timePCR .

The expression of TRIM15 mRNA was analyzed using semi - quantitative RT - PCR ( upper panel ) and quantitative real - time PCR ( bottom panel ) . The result was obtained from the representative experiment which was performed in triplicate . β - actin was used as an internal control and 18S rRNA was used for normalization of TRIM15 mRNA levels . 418 O . - H . Lee et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1853 ( 2015 ) 409 – 421 other types of TRIM family proteins have been shown to interact with ubiquitin - conjugating E2 enzymes . Conversely , TRIM15 was not shown to interact with UBE2 enzymes [ 22 ] , supporting the possibility that theRINGdomainofTRIM15isnotassociatedwithE3ubiquitinligaseac - tivity . Furthermore , our data indicated that the RING domain of TRIM15 is not responsible for TRIM15 - mediated inhibition of cell migration . Our small - scale screen for TRIM15 binding to integrin adhesome proteins revealed a possible linkbetween TRIM15and dynamic changes of the actin cytoskeleton , including assembly and disassembly of actin ﬁ laments and focal adhesion formation . VASP , FBLIM1 , CTTN , and CORO1BweretherepresentativeTRIM15 - bindingproteinsthatregulate actindynamics . TRIM15wasalsointeractedwithsignalingadaptorsand kinases involved in post - translational modi ﬁ cation . Although we did not provide a detailed mechanism by which these interacting proteins mediate TRIM15 functions to inhibit cell migration , it is likely that TRIM15 serves as a scaffolding protein under integrin to recruit several signaling molecules and effectors that affect cellular motility . OurstudyindicatesthatCTTNisoneofregulatorsaffectedbyTRIM15 expression . We did not observe TRIM15 effect on VASP phosphorylation ( data not shown ) . Basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CTTN was higher in cells expressing TRIM15 , suggesting that CTTN phosphoryla - tion was altered by TRIM15 . Moreover , EGF did not induce CTTN tyro - sine phosphorylation in TRIM15 - expressing cells . Phosphorylation status of CTTN is believed to be critical for actin dynamics [ 23 ] . Serine phosphorylation ( S405 and S418 ) activates CTTN binding to N - WASP for actin polymerization , whereas tyrosine phosphorylation ( Y421 , Y466 , and Y482 ) inhibits N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization [ 15 ] . Thisreciprocal serine / tyrosinephosphorylationof CTTNmightultimate - ly control cell migration through tight regulation of actin remodeling . In addition , CTTN is known to anegative or positive regulator of cell migra - tion depending on its tyrosine phosphorylation [ 17 ] . Knockdown of CTTN impairs cell motility in gastric cancer cell lines with lower level of phosphorylated CTTN , whereas it increases cell migration in gastric cancer cell lines with hyperphosphorylated CTTN . Differential functions of CTTN are known to be resulted from activation of p130Cas pathway . Knockdownofhyperphosphorylated CTTN enhances p130Cas activation increasing cell motility . Therefore , distorted regulation of CTTN phos - phorylation by TRIM15 may be involved in inhibition of cell migration . Fig . 7 . TRIM15inhibitsmigrationofcoloncancercells .

Lee et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1853 ( 2015 ) 409 – 421 The expression of TRIM15 was highly tissue - selective and was enriched in thecolon . Colon epithelialcells undergo aspatially and tem - porallyregulatedmaturationprogram , astheymigratealongthecolonic crypt axis toward the luminal surface [ 24 ] . Our ﬁ nding that TRIM15 is highly expressed in the upper - epithelial region of colon crypts and the surface epithelium suggests that TRIM15 plays an important role in maturation programming of intestinal epithelial cells . To induce colon cell differentiation , the genetic reprogramming that regulates cell motility is essential . Several cell structure and adhesion proteins , as well as the genes associated with a reduced rate of cell migration , are up - regulated in differentiated colon epithelial cells [ 25 , 26 ] . Our ob - servation that TRIM15 expression suppresses cell motility indicates a possible function of TRIM15 in colon epithelial cell maturation . Deregulated expression of proteins that control cell - ECM adhesion and cell migration plays a key role in cancer development . For example , nischarin has been identi ﬁ ed as an interacting protein with the integrin α 5subunit . Nischarinreduces α 5 β 1 - dependentcellmigrationinseveral cell types [ 27 ] . The loss of nischarin expression is strongly associated with breast cancer progression [ 28 ] . β - parvin , an adaptor protein that binds to the integrin - linked kinase , is also downregulated in breast can - cer . Ectopic expression of β - parvin in breast cancer cells suppresses anchorage - independent cell growth and tumor cell invasion [ 11 ] . Likewise , RT - PCR analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of colon cancer tissues revealed that TRIM15 expression was signi ﬁ cantly re - duced in colon adenocarcinoma samples . Conversely , overexpression of TRIM15 inhibited cell motility , as well as both in vitro and in vivo growth of colon cancer cells . These observations suggest that TRIM15 may function as a tumor suppressor by modulating the focal adhesion complex - dependent signaling pathway . Taken together , our data indicate that a potential association exists between TRIM15 , a component of focal adhesions , and the differentia - tion of epithelial cells or anti - tumorigenic activity . Although we have identi ﬁ ed possible roles for TRIM15 in focal adhesion sites regulating cell migration , the de ﬁ nitive mechanism by which TRIM15 localizes to focal adhesions and inhibits cellular migration remains unclear . To answer this question , further studies of the effects of TRIM15 on the interacting proteins that we identi ﬁ ed in this work will be important . The epigenetic modi ﬁ cation controlling both the transcriptional activa - tion of TRIM15 in colon epithelial cells undergoing differentiation and the transcriptional suppression of TRIM15 in cancer will be of great in - terestfor future studies . A greaterunderstandingof this process will un - doubtedly provide important information for understanding intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis .
