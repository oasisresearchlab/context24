The experiments randomly varied the prevalence of weak ties in the networks of over 20 million people over a 5 - year period , during which 2 billion new ties and 600 , 000 new jobs were created . The results provided experimental causal evidence supporting the strength of weak ties and suggested three revisions to the theory : First , the strength of weak ties was nonlinear . Statistical analysis found an inverted U - shaped relationship between tie strength and job transmission such that weaker ties increased job transmission but only to a point , after which there were diminishing marginal returns to tie weakness . Second , weak ties measured by interaction intensity and the number of mutual connections displayed varying effects . Moderately weak ties ( measured by mutual connections ) and the weakest ties ( measured by interaction intensity ) created the most job mobility . Third , the strength of weak ties varied by industry . Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries , strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries . T he Strength of Weak Ties ( 1 ) is one of the most influential social theories of the past century , underpinning networked theories of information diffusion ( 2 , 3 ) , social contagion ( 4 , 5 ) , social movements ( 6 ) , industry structure ( 7 ) , influence maximi - zation ( 8 ) , and human cooperation ( 9 , 10 ) . It argues that infrequent , arms - length relation - ships , knownas “ weak ties , ” providemorenew employment opportunities ( 11 ) , promotions and greater wage increases ( 12 ) , creativity ( 13 ) , innovation ( 14 , 15 ) , productivity ( 16 ) , and performance ( 17 ) because they deliver more novel information than strong ties . Weak ties are thought to provide access to diverse , novel information because they connect us to dispa - rate and diverse parts of the human social network ( 18 – 24 ) . In addition to productivity , performance , innovation , and other benefits , weak ties are thought to be specifically well suited to deliver new employment opportuni - ties because they provide novel labor market information , making job mobility a centerpiece of the original weak tie theory . Recent large - scale correlational investiga - tions of the weak tie hypothesis , however , have uncovered a seeming “ paradox of weak ties , ” suggesting that strong ties are more valuable than weak ties in generating job transmissions ( 25 , 26 ) . Though these are the largest , most direct empirical examinations of the weak tie hypothesis to date , because the work is not experimental the authors right - fully acknowledge that their results “ may not be the true causal effect of tie strength on the probability of a sequential job . ” More generally , two empirical challenges have prevented robust causal tests of the weak tie theory to date : First , a lack of large - scale data linking human social networks to job transmission makes mea - surement of the relationship between weak ties and labor market outcomes difficult . Second , network ties and labor market outcomes are endogenous , making the causal link between weak ties and job placement elusive . Individ - uals ’ labor market outcomes are likely to be determined by and to simultaneously deter - mine their social networks . The evolution of social networks and job trajectories are also likely correlated with unobserved factors such as effort , ability , and sociability , which confound empiricalidentificationofthelinkbetweenweak ties and jobs . We address these two empirical challenges and provide an experimental causal test of 1304 16 SEPTEMBER 2022 (cid:129) VOL 377 ISSUE 6612 science . org SCIENCE 1 LinkedIn Corporation , 700 E Middlefield Rd , Mountain View , CA 94043 , USA . 2 Harvard Business School , Soldiers Field , Boston , MA 02163 , USA . 3 Stanford University , 353 Jane Stanford Way , Stanford , CA 94305 , USA . 4 National Bureau of Economic Research , 1050 Massachusetts Ave . , Cambridge , MA 02138 , USA . 5 Massachusetts Institute of Technology , MIT Sloan School of Management , 100 Main St . , Cambridge , MA 02142 , USA . * Corresponding author .

EASTERN TIME ON THE THURSDAY BEFORE THIS DATE : the weak tie theory with data from multiple large - scalerandomizedexperimentsonLinkedIn , theworld ’ slargest professional socialnetwork . The experiments randomly varied the preva - lence of strong and weak ties in the profes - sional networks of over 20 million LinkedIn membersbyadjustingtheplatform ’ sPeopleYou May Know ( PYMK ) algorithm , which recom - mends new connections to members ( Fig . 1A illustrates the experimental design ) . LinkedIn ’ s PYMK algorithm is an ensemble machine learn - ing model comprising the following : ( i ) a model for estimating the propensity of an ego ( i . e . , a focal member ) to send a connection invite to an alter ( i . e . , a member the focal member is not currently connected with ) , ( ii ) a model estimating the alter ’ s propensity to accept an invite from the ego , ( iii ) a model estimating the engagement between the ego and alter once connected and ( iv ) weights on each of these models for relative importance . The ex - periments tuned these components , introduced new data sources , and relied on the number of mutual connections between the ego and a potential tie recommendation as one of the most important features of the ensemble model to randomly vary weak and strong tie rec - ommendations . We performed a retrospec - tive analysis of the randomization created by thePYMKexperimentsconductedbyLinkedInbetween2015and2019intwowaves . The first wave examined a global experiment conducted in 2015 that had over 4 million ex - perimental subjects and created over 19 million newconnections . Wecollectededge - levelobser - vations of tie strength and job transmission outcomes for each tie created during this ex - periment . We then analyzed a larger second wave of node - level PYMK experiments that took place worldwide in 2019 . The second wave spanned every continent and US state , had more than 16 million experimental sub - jects , created ~ 2 billion new connections and recorded more than 70 million job applica - tions that led to 600 , 000 new jobs during the experimental period ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . The data were collected both at the node level ( in 2019 ) , whereeachobservationcorrespondstoauniqueLinkedInmember , and at the edge level ( in 2015 ) , where each observation corresponds to a unique tie between two LinkedIn members ( see Fig . 1A for a description of how we com - piled the edge - and node - level datasets ) . We analyzed labor market mobility by mea - suring both job applications and job trans - missions . Job applications are simply the number of jobs LinkedIn members applied to on the platform in the three months after an experiment . In accordance with the litera - ture ( 25 , 26 ) , we consider a job transmission to have occurred when three criteria are satisfied : First , user A reports working at company c at date D 1 . Second , user B reports working at that same company c at a later date D 2 , with D 2 and D 1 being at least one year apart . Third , user A and user B were friends on the social network at least one full year before D 2 . In the weak tie literature , when these three criteria are met , a tie is considered a “ sequential job ” tie , which represents the state of the art in measuring relational job mobility . We measured tie strength by its two lead - ing indicators : the intensity of the interaction between two people and the number of mutual connectionstheyhadincommon . Wemeasured interaction intensity by counting the number of interactions LinkedIn members had with one another through bilateral messaging . We measured mutual friendship by counting the number of friends any two connected in - dividuals had in common when their tie was created .

Network diversity is defined as 1 − C i , where C i is the local clustering coefficient ( formally defined in the SM ) . Because tie strength changes in response to one ’ s own friending behavior and the friend - ing behavior of one ’ s connections , we mea - sured structural tie strength pretreatment and examined the causal effect of adding a new connection whose pretreatment tie strength was either strong or weak depending on whether it was above or below the median of the pre – treatment tie strength distribution ( Fig . 2C ) . Interaction intensity is observed once a new tie is created . We therefore measured interaction intensity during the experimental periodafter tieswereformed . Jobseekershave more connections ( greater degree ) ( Fig . 2A ) and greater network diversity at higher degrees ( Fig . 2B ) . But because these network variables areendogenouslydeterminedinobservationaldata , random variation in LinkedIn members networks is necessary for a robust causal as - sessment of the relationship between weak ties and job mobility . We estimated the causal effects of strong and weak ties on job mobility with an instru - mentalvariables ( IV ) approach ( 27 – 29 ) . The IV framework disentangles endogeneity by using random variation created by exogenous treat - ment assignments as a shock to endogenous counts of newly created weak and strong ties to estimate their causal effect on job mobility . We estimated these effects in a two - stage least squares ( 2SLS ) specification , using the random assignment of members to weak - or strong - tie experimental variants as instruments for identi - fying the effect of adding weak or strong ties on job applications and job transmissions . We conducted both node - level and edge - level analyses of the relationship between tie strength and job mobility . Node - level analyses estimated the effect of the number of weak or strong ties created by the experiments on job applications and job mobility .

EASTERN TIME ON THE THURSDAY BEFORE THIS DATE : to weak - or strong - tie – inducing experimental treatments created changes in job mobility , it obfuscates which weak or strong ties led to job transmission . We therefore also conducted edge - level analyses to estimate the marginal effect of adding strong or weak ties to members ’ networks on their subsequent job mobility . The first stage regressions estimated the ef - fects of assignments to different experimental treatment variants on the creation of weak and strong ties in LinkedIn members ’ profes - sional networks . The results of these first stage regressions , shown in Fig . 2D , demonstrate the random variation created by our experi - ments by displaying the effects of the experi - mental treatment variants on the creation of weak and strong ties between members in the LinkedIn network . As the figure shows , some treatment variants caused members to form more weak ties ( e . g . , variants A and E ) , whereasotherscausedmembers to formfewer weak ties ( e . g . , variants F and G ) . The different variants also caused members to create more ties ( e . g . , variants A , C , and E ) , fewer ties ( e . g . , variant G ) , or approximately the same number of ties ( e . g . , variants B , D , and F ) , allowing us to distinguish the causal effect of tie strength on job outcomes from the causal effects of the number of new ties created . The second stage regressions estimated the effect of weak and strong ties on job mobility . The fitted values estimated in the first stage captured only those changes in the number of new weak or strong ties caused by our ex - periments . In the second stage only the varia - tion in the creation of new weak or strong ties caused by our exogenous treatment assign - ments was used to estimate the effects of weak or strong ties on job applications and job transmissions . In this way the IV approach enabled causal inference by excluding ( i ) the effects of job mobility on the formation of weak andstrongties , ( ii ) theeffectsofstrategic network formation behaviors that precede job mobility , and ( iii ) variation created by observ - able and unobservable confounding factors that can affect both network formation and job mobility , from estimates of the effects of weak and strong ties on labor market behav - iors and outcomes . For our approach to provide valid causal inference , the treatment assignment to a PYMK algorithm variant should be a valid instrument for the number of weak andstrong ties created by experimental subjects and thus should satisfy four assumptions ( 27 ) . First , the independence assumption , which requires that the instrument was randomly assigned , was satisfied as the LinkedIn experimentation platform used a Bernoulli design to randomly assign all users to different treatment arms . Second , the exclusion restriction , which re - quires that the instrument did not affect the outcome through any channels except the SCIENCE science . org 16 SEPTEMBER 2022 (cid:129) VOL 377 ISSUE 6612 1307 OLS IV 0 . 002 0 . 003 0 . 004 0 . 005 0 10 20 30 Number of mutual friends P r obab ili t y o f j ob t r an s m i ss i on 0 . 000 0 . 001 0 . 002 0 . 003 0 . 004 0 10 20 30 Number of mutual friends Edge - level relationship between structural tie strength and job transmission 0 . 000 0 . 001 0 . 002 0 . 003 0 . 004 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Interaction intensity P r obab ili t y o f j ob t r an s m i ss i on 0 . 000 0 . 001 0 . 002 0 . 003 0 . 004 0 . 005 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Interaction intensity Edge - level relationship between interaction intensity and job transmission A B C 0 . 0000 0 . 0005 0 . 0010 0 . 0015 0 . 0020 0 . 0025 Weak Medium Strong Tie type J ob t r an s m i ss i on s pe r t i e −0 . 01 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 Weak Medium Strong Tie type Node−level job transmission regression Fig . 3 .

It also had no effect on how members interacted or shared social information with each other ( e . g . , messages , posts , comments , likes , andshares ) , other than through the new connections formed as a re - sult of the experiments ( see Section C . 3 and table S24 in the SM ) . Third , the monoton - icity assumption , precluding the existence of “ defiers ”— egos that initiated more weak tie connections when assigned to an algorithm that promoted strong ties — was satisfied by the design of the PYMK algorithm , which assigned suggested treatment connections to ranks that were much more likely to be clicked on and initiated . This assumption was also satisfied by the strong suggestive evidence that these assignments worked to create the desired behaviors observed in the new con - nection outcomes for each treatment variant ( Fig . 2D ) . Fourth , the relevance assumption , which requires that the instrument had an effect on the treatment , was satisfied by the varying numbers of weak , strong , and total ties created by the different treatment arms shown in Fig . 2 ( see Section C . 3 of the SM for an in - depth discussion of these assumptions and their verification ) . To estimate the bias in correlational analyses of the weak tie hypoth - esis , we also specified and estimated stan - dard ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regressions assessing the correspondence between tie strength and job mobility . Our main results are summarized in Fig . 3 . The first column in each panel displays results from OLS estimation whereas the second column displays results from the experimental instrumental variables ( IV ) analysis . Dots rep - resent point estimates of the effects and bars represent standard errors . Figure 3A displays the results of our OLS and experimental esti - mates of the effect of weak and strong ties on job transmissions at the node level . Although the OLS analysis replicated previous findings of an apparent paradox of weak ties in which strong ties were more strongly correlated with job transmissions , the experimental IV anal - ysis reversed this result and suggested a non - linear relationship between tie strength and job transmission in which medium strength ties were the most effective in generating job mobility . As the statistical power of the node - level analysis was not sufficient to confirm in - dividual differences between the effects of strong , medium , and weak ties in our experi - ments , we also analyzed these relationships at the more granular edge level .

Although the OLS estimates again replicated previous correla - tional research demonstrating the paradox of weak ties and showed that strong ties were more strongly correlated with an increased probability of a job transmission through the tie , the experimental IV results mirrored the node - level experimental results and revealed a more nuanced correspondence — namely that there was an inverted U - shaped relationship between tie strength and the likelihood of a job transmission . At low levels of mutual friendship adding new ties with more mutual friends caused the probability of a job trans - mission to go up . However , adding ties with more than ten friends in common reduced the probability of a job transmission .

Although the OLS estimates showed that stronger ties were correlated with an increased probability of job transmission the experimental IV results revealed the opposite — the stronger the newly added ties the less likely they were to lead to a job transmission . This relationship was also nonlinear . The weakest ties with the least interaction intensity increased the likeli - hood of a job transmission the most whereas the strongest ties with the greatest interaction intensity increased the likelihood of a job transmission the least ; further , the relation - ship between interaction intensity and job transmission was approximately flat for the middle quartiles of the interaction intensity distribution . Three major conclusions emerged from our main results : First , experimental analysis helped resolve the apparent paradox of weak ties in multiple large - scale experiments of job mobil - ity in the world ’ s largest professional social network . Although the correlational analysis supportedtheseemingimportanceofstrongtiesforjobmobility , the experimental analyses — conducted over multiple sample populations , numerous years , and in all geographic regions oftheworld — confirmedthat relativelyweaker ties increased the likelihood of job mobility the most . Second , our experiments uncovered a con - sistent nonlinearity in the relationship between tie strength and job mobility . In contrast to the increasing likelihood of job transmission associated with greater tie strength in correla - tional analyses , our experiments showed that whenconsideringstructuraltiestrength based on the number of mutual friends between contacts , an inverted U - shaped relationship exists between tie strength and job mobility — with moderately weak ties increasing job mobil - ity the most and the strongest ties increasing job mobility the least . When considering tie strength based on interaction intensity , in a direct reversal of the correlational evidence , the experimental analysis showed that the weakest ties had the greatest impact on job mobility whereas the strongest ties had the least . Third , whereas node - level analyses measured the impact of experimental variation in the number of weak or strong ties in one ’ s network on job transmission , our edge - level analysis enabled an assessment of the marginal effects of adding strong or weak ties . The results showed that adding new moderately structur - ally diverse ties with weak interaction inten - sity created the greatest marginal increases in the likelihood of job transmissions . Prior research also suggests that weak and strong ties have different effects across dif - ferent industries ( 22 ) . We therefore examined the heterogeneity in the impact of strong and weak ties on job mobility across industry sec - tors . Although the second wave experimental sample was sufficiently powered to examine this heterogeneity , experiments conducted in this wave in 2019 do not leave sufficient time to examine impacts on longer - term job trans - mission outcomes . Therefore we limited our analysis of these heterogeneous effects to job applications , which are estimable in the short term . We classified the industries in which LinkedIn members applied for jobs on the basis of the demand for particular skills listed for those jobs and the counts of occupations in different industries calculated from Burning Glass Tech - nologies ( BGT ) data and other sources ( see sup - plementary material for details ) . The industry classifications were created by measuring the weighted skill demands of all job postings within an industry listed in the BGT data and the counts of an industry ’ s hiring for different occupations listed in the job postings of that industry . Based on these metrics , we developed scores that measured each industry ’ s informa - tiontechnology ( IT ) intensity , softwareintensity , suitability for machine learning , suitability for artificial intelligence , degree of robotization , and suitability for remote work using known indices for these metrics in the labor econom - ics literature ( 30 – 32 ) . We then measured the degree to which experimental variation in the acquisition of new strong or weak ties led to increases or decreases in job applications to industries of these types . Results of our IV analysis showed that , in thefullsample , adding weaktiesled to morejob applications overall ( Fig . 4A ) , which provides evidence of the mechanism linking weak ties to job transmissions . As members acquired more weak ties through the PYMK algorithm experiments they applied to more jobs and experienced considerably greater job mobility . The heterogeneous treatment effects also re - flect a clear trend toward weak ties creating greater job mobility in more digital sectors of the economy . The results showed that weak ties resulted in more job applications than strong ties to industries with greater IT ( Fig . 4B ) and software intensity ( Fig . 4C ) , as well as industries more suitable for machine learning ( Fig . 4D ) , artificial intelligence ( Fig . 4E ) and remote work ( Fig . 4G ) , along with those that have experienced a greater degree of robotization ( Fig . 4F ) . By contrast , adding strong ties caused more job applications to industries that relied less on software ( Fig . 4C ) and were less automated by robots ( Fig . 4F ) . Although our work presents the first large - scale , longitudinal , experimental evidence on the causal effects of strong and weak ties on job mobility in a global sample and across multiple industries , it is not without limitations . First , although PYMK experiments provided a robust channel through which to introduce experimental variation into the evolution of human social networks , we could not compel LinkedIn users to take these recommendations . Therefore a degree of self selection exists in who acted on the connection recommendations . For this reason we analyzed our experiments as having an “ intent to treat ” and compared the population assigned to weak - tie experimental variants to those assigned to strong - tie exper - imental variants and control groups ( for raw intent to treat point estimates , see table S14 ) . Although this approach controls for any bias from self selection , it circumscribes the popu - lations to which our resultsgeneralize . Although thereweresomeobservabledifferencesbetweenmemberswhotookPYMKrecommendationsonLinkedInandthosewhodidnot , most did , making our results broadly generalizable to the LinkedIn population . However , unsurprising - ly , exposure depended on use of the platform and viewing the PYMK recommendations . As we report in the SM , LinkedIn members ex - posed to our treatments were slightly younger and more active job seekers , clarifying the pop - ulation to which our results reliably generalize . Second , LinkedIn is a professional social network and may be different than other online social networks such as Facebook or offline social relationships such as those originally studied by Granovetter . However we do know that certain characteristics such as network clustering , for example , are similar across Facebook , LinkedIn , and Twitter ( see SM Sec - tion F . 2 ) . Furthermore , our OLS results closely mirrored the results of very large global studies of networks and job mobility on Facebook , which suggests that similar processes are oc - curring in both networks . There are some dif - ferences between the population of workers on LinkedIn and those in the US , European , and broader global economies . For example , LinkedIn skews more heavily toward workers in finance , informationandprofessionalservices , high technology industries , and construction SCIENCE science . org 16 SEPTEMBER 2022 (cid:129) VOL 377 ISSUE 6612 1309 RESEARCH | REPORTS EMBARGOED UNTIL 2PM U .

EASTERN TIME ON THE THURSDAY BEFORE THIS DATE : and manufacturing , and less toward whole - sale and retail trade work than the US work - force ( see SM Section F . 2 for a comparison of LinkedIn profiles with the US and EU work - forces ) . However , LinkedIn is also the world ’ s largest professional social network and one of the largest websites for job listings . Many people rely on LinkedIn to find work so this network may be even more representative of how networks affect job mobility in the larger labor market than , for example , friendship net - works or the Facebook network . Third , any networked experiment must pay close attention to the possibility of statistical interference , in which one unit ’ s treatment assignment affects another unit ’ s outcome , the ignorability of which is known as the stable unit treatment value assumption ( 33 ) . To mini - mize such interference we only tracked the edgesthateachmemberinitiatedthroughPYMKrecommendations . Nevertheless , there were still three possible channels through which interfer - ence could have occurred in our setting . First , interference could have emerged if an ego ’ s treatment assignment affected their alters through changes in ego ’ s behaviors that were visible to the alters . LinkedIn facilitates some social actions that might have been seen by a member ’ salters including postingonthenews feed , commenting on a post , or sending private messages . However , none of these behaviors were considerably affected by the various treat - ments , making this channel of interference unlikely to affect our results ( see table S24 ) . A second interference channel could have arisen if member i intended to connect with member j but , because of member j ’ s treatment assign - ment , j initiated a connection request before i had achance to send one . Ifaccepted , such ties would be attributed to ego j in our analysis . To account for this possibility we verified that the treatments did not affect the number of connection requests received by members in different treatment arms , allowing us to con - clude that any effect from receiving connec - tion requests was small and balanced across treatments and therefore negligible ( see table S25 ) . Third , interference could have occurred if new ties generated by members as a result of treatment changed the composition of other members ’ PYMKrecommendationlists . Fortu - nately , LinkedIn ’ s membership is large enough to ensure a sufficient inventory of new ties to replenish any removed ties with comparable individuals , ensuringthatthecompositionofthe potential ties was consistent throughout the experiment . Furthermore , PYMK inputs did not change often enough for new connections to immediately change the types of algorithmic recommendations any member saw , ensuring the experiments ’ stability . This minimized the risk that connection behaviors instantaneously updated the algorithms and thus changed the types of recommendations other members saw . Formoredetailsontheinterferenceassumption , please see SM Section C . 2 . Despite these limitations , our analysis of several large - scale experiments on the world ’ s largestprofessionalsocialnetworkdemonstratedthatweaktiescreatejobmobility . In contrast to recent large - scale correlational evidence of a paradox of weak ties , we found that moder - ately weak ties with low interaction intensity — measured by the number of mutual friends between two people — increased job applications and job transmissions the most , whereas strong ties — measured by both the number of mutual friends and interaction intensity — increased job applications and job transmissions the least . We also found an inverted U - shaped relationship between structural tie strength and job trans - missions and a nonmonotonically decreasing correspondence between interaction intensity and job transmissions , demonstrating a con - sistent nonlinearity in the relationship be - tween tie strength and job mobility , as well as heterogeneity in the impact of weak ties on job applications across industries with varying de - greesofdigitization . Theindustryanalysisshowed that weak ties caused more job applications to high - tech industries , broadly speaking , whereas strong ties caused more job applications to low - tech industries . Together , these results provide some of the first large - scale experimental evi - dence of the strength of weak ties and suggest the need to revise the theory to incorporate the nonlinear effects of tie strength on job trans - missions , differences between the effects of structural tie strength and tie strength mea - sured by interaction intensity , and differences between the effects of weak and strong ties on job mobility across industries .
