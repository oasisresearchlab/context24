Cellular Transformation and Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Activity Are Catalyzed by a Common Domain on the dbZ Oncogene Product * ( Received for publication , September 16 , 1993 , and in revised form , October 18 , 1993 ) Matthew J .

These include the Saccha - romyces cereuieiae cell division cycle protein , CDC24 , the breakpoint cluster region protein , the ect2 and uau oncogene products , and the brain GDP - releasing factor for Ras . Previous studies have provided evidence that oncogenic Dbl or an associated protein stimulates GDP dissociation from the human species ( Ha ) homolog of CDC42 . We show here that Dbl specifically complexes with the GDP - bound forms of CDC42Hs and Rho & but not Racl or TC10 , and that this specificity correlates with the ability of Dbl to act as a GDP - releasing factor . Small deletions throughout the Dbl domain , which inac - tivate transformation , eliminated the ability of Dbl to stimulate GDP dissociation , whereas deletions outside of this domain did not impair either function . Finally , the Dbl domain itself , when expressed and purified as a recombinant protein , was shown to stimulate GDP dis - sociation from purified , recombinant CDC42Hs . These findings establish that a minimal unit on Dbl that is critical to its transforming function directly regulates GDP - GTP exchange activity . The dbl oncogene ( 1 , 21 , first identified by transfecting the DNA from diffuse B cell lymphomas into NIH3T3 cells , encodes a cytosolic 66 - kDa protein . Oncogenic activation of Dbl occurs as a result of an amino - terminal truncation of the 115 - kDa proto - dbl product ( 3 , 4 ) . Aregion between residues 498 and 738 of proto - Dbl , retained by oncogenic Dbl , shares significant se - quence similarity with the Saccharomyces cereuisiae cell divi - sion cycle protein , CDC24 ( 51 , which acts together with the GM47458 .

Ras - like GTP - binding protein , CDC42 ( CDC42Sc ) , to regulate bud site assembly in yeast ( 6 , 7 ) . This region of similarity , designated as the Dbl domain , has been detected in a number of potential growth regulatory proteins including Bcrl ( 81 , the ect2 ( 9 ) and vav ( 10 ) oncogene products , and the guanine nucleotide - releasing factor ( GRF ) for Ras ( 11 ) . Previously , we reported ( 12 ) that the baculovirus - expressed Dbl catalyzed the dissociation of GDP from the human CDC42 protein ( CDC42Hs ) ( 13 ) ; however , it was not possible to con - clude whether Dbl alone was sufficient for this activity or if Dbl acted together with other cellular factors to catalyze GDP - GTP exchange . Moreover , it has not yet been demonstrated that other molecules containing the Dbl domain function as GRFs . Recently , it has been reported that the vav oncogene product participates in the stimulation of the guanine nucleotide ex - change activity of Ras ( 14 ) . It was suggested that the Dbl ho - mology domain was essential for this stimulation ; however , it is puzzling that this domain does not share sequence similarity with the region on CDC25 that stimulates the guanine nucleo - tide exchange activity of the Ras proteins ( 15 ) and that the analogous Dbl domain within the Ras - GRF does not stimulate Ras GDP - GTP exchange activity ( 11 ) . The present studies were undertaken to address the bio - chemical role of the Dbl homology domain . Specifically , we have set out to determine if Dbl itself exhibits the biochemical char - acteristics of a guanine nucleotide releasing factor and then to define the region of Dbl responsible for GDP dissociation activ - ity and establish its relationship to the domain responsible for Dbl transforming function . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Complex Formation of GST - GTP - binding Proteins with Dbl - The cDNh coding for GST - Racl and TClO were obtained from Dr . Alan Hall ( Chester Beatty Cancer Institute , London ) and Dr . Peter DEustachio ( Mount Sinai Medical School ) , respectively . The polymeRase chain re - action was used to insert the cDNAof the RhoA protein into the BamHI - EcoRI cloning sites of the pGEX - ST vector ( 16 ) . The cDNA for c - Ha - Ras in the pGEX - 1N plasmid was obtained from Dr . H . Maruta ( University of Melbourne ) . The GST - CDC42Hs was prepared as previously de - scribed ( 13 ) . The cDNA for CDC42Hs”” - 17 ( where a threonine is changed to an asparagine ) was generated using the Double Take Kit ( Stratagene ) . Approximately 50 pg of each of the GST - GTP - binding proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 “C uersus 20 m ~ Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m ~ dithio - threitol , 5 m ~ MgC12 , 20 % glycerol , and 2 . 5 p ~ GDP , diluted to a final volume of 300 p1 with 100 pl of a 50 % slurry of glutathione - agarose , and incubated at room temperature for - 1 h . The pelleted beads were in - cubated in 0 . 6 ml of buffer A ( 20 m ~ Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m ~ dithio - threitol , 10 m ~ EDTA , 50 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 d m 1 leupeptin , and 10 pg / ml aprotinin ) for 1 h at room temperature to establish a guanine nucleotide - depleted state , resuspended in buffer A , and then divided into 3 aliquots . Each aliquot was pelleted and resus - pended in 400 pl of either buffer A , buffer B ( buffer Awith 10 m ~ MgCL plus 120 p ~ GDP substituted for 10 m ~ EDTA ) , or buffer C ( buffer B except that 120 p ~ GTPyS was substituted for 120 p ~ GDP ) and incu - bated at room temperature for 30 min . Aliquots ( 90 111 ) from Spodoptera frugiperda cell lysates expressing oncogenic Dbl ( 12 ) were mixed ( for 2 . 5 h at 4 “C ) with 300 pl of either buffer A , B , or C and then incubated with glutathione - agarose beads containing the GST - GTP - binding proteins that had been resuspended with 50 pl of the corresponding buffer . The The abbreviations used are : Bcr , break point cluster region protein ; GAPS , GTPase - activating proteins for low molecular mass GTP - binding proteins ; GRFs , guanine nucleotide - releasing factors for low molecular mass GTP - binding proteins ; GST , glutathione S - transfeRase ; GTPyS , guanosine 5’ - 3 - O - ( thio ) triphosphate . 62 Cellular Dansformation and Nucleotide Exchange Activity 63 different suspensions were washed twice by centrifugation , and the pellets that contained the different glutathione - agarose beads ( that bound the GST - GTP - binding proteins ) were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an anti - Dbl antibody raised against amino acids 890 - 908 ( of the proto - Dbl amino acid sequence ) , complexed to lZsI - labeled protein A . Preparation of GST - Dbl and the Different Dbl Mutants - The GST - Dbl fusion proteins designated GST - Dbl , GST - Db1A " 7692s , and GST - Dbl homology domain ( GST - DM - H ( residues 499 - 753 ) ) were prepared by introducing a BamHI site at the start codons for oncogenic dbl ( by the polymerase chain reaction ) in order to fuse the dbl cDNAs in frame with the 3 ' end of the GST cDNA in the pGEX - 2T vector . Sequences between the Xbal and BamHI sites that contain the coding regions for GST were inserted together with the coding regions for the different Dbl proteins ( contained between the BamHI and PstI sites ) into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL . 1393 ( Invitrogen ) . The different GST - Dbl proteins were purified from S . frugiperda ( St9 ) cells by glutathione - agarose chro - matography as outlined in Koland et al . ( 17 ) . The cDNAs expressing the mutated forms of Dbl designated DbIAaw6 , DbIA6 ? - ? , and DblA807413 were cloned into the mamma - lian expression vector pZIP - neo - SV ( X ) I and transfected into NIH3T3 cells as outlined in Ron et al . ( 5 ) . DblAsO , M1 " , DbIAm7O , and GST - DblAR7692s were expressed poorly in NIH3T3 cells and so instead were expressed in S . fiugiperda cells using approaches similar to those de - scribed in Graziani et al . ( 18 ) . Immunoprecipitation of DbZ Mutants - NIH3T3 cell lysates ( 2 . 5 - 4 . 0 ml , adjusted to obtain comparable levels of the expressed Dbl protein as assessed by Western analysis ) were mixed with 90 - 150 pl of anti - Dbl antibody ( 1 mg / ml ) raised against amino acid residues 890 - 908 ( of the predicted proto - Dbl sequence ) , or 150 - 200 pl of S . fiugiperda cell ly - sates were mixed with 80 pl of the anti - Dbl antibody for 2 . 5 h at 4 " C . In the case of the GST - Db1A876925 , an anti - Dbl antibody raised against amino acid residues 818 - 831 ( of the proto - Dbl sequence ) was used for immunoprecipitation . A 50 % slurry of protein A - Sepharose beads ( 90 - 110 111 for the NIH3T3 cell experiments and 50 1 . 11 for the S . fiugiperda experiments ) was added to these incubations for 25 min at 4 " C . Im - mune complexes were recovered by precipitation and then visualized by Western blotting with an anti - Dbl antibody raised against residues 890 - 908 or against residues 818 - 831 ( when blotting the DblAR76g2s mutant ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The interaction of a GRF with a Ras - like protein is analogous to the interactions of hormone receptors with heterotrimeric GTP - binding ( G ) proteins ( 19 ) . The latter are dependent upon the nucleotide - bound state of the G protein . Thus , the receptor initially complexes with the GDP - bound form and stimulates the dissociation of GDP , resulting in a tight complex with the nucleotide - depleted G protein . Subsequent binding of GTP stimulates the dissociation of the hormone receptor , enabling it to couple to other G proteins in the GDP - bound state . By anal - ogy , we sought to ascertain whether Dbl exhibited biochemical properties of a classical GRF . Specifically , we investigated whether baculovirus - expressed Dbl interacted in vitro with a GSTICDC42Hs fusion protein and with some of its closest ho - mologs ( GST - Racl , GST - RhoA , and GST - TC10 ) in a guanine nucleotide - dependent manner ( Fig . 1 ) . Complex formation was demonstrated with the guanine nucleotide - depleted forms of CDC42Hs ( Fig . lA , lane 7 ; Fig . lB , lane 1 ) , RhoA ( Fig . lA , lane lo ) , and Racl ( Fig . lB , lane 4 ) , and to a much lesser extent with TClO ( Fig . lB , lane 7 ) , but not detectably with Ras ( Fig . LA , lane 4 ) , as assessed by the ability of Dbl to co - precipitate with these GST - GTP - binding proteins following the addition of glutathione - agarose . Complex formation also was observed with the GDP - bound forms of CDC42Hs ( Fig . lA , lane 8 ; Fig . lB , lane 2 ) and RhoA ( Fig . lA , lane 11 ) , but to a lesser extent than that observed with the guanine nucleotide - depleted forms of the GTP - binding proteins , and was completely eliminated with the addition of GTPyS ( Fig . lA , lane 9 , and Fig . lB , lane 3 , for CDC42Hs ; Fig . LA , lane 12 , for RhoA ) . These findings indicated that Dbl possessed properties of a GRF for both RhoA and CDC42Hs .

Interactions of CDC42Hs and related proteins with on - cogenic Dbl . A , co - precipitation of E . coli - expressed GST - Ras , GST - CDC42Hs , and GST - RhoA with Dbl was performed as described under " Experimental Procedures . " The lanes designated Control represent ex - periments where the GST protein , alone ( Le . instead of a GST - GTP - binding protein ) , was used . For every set of three samples , the first sample represents the guanine nucleotide - depleted state ( ie . lanes I , 4 , GDP - bound state , and the third sample ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ) repre - 7 , and IO ) , the second sample ( lanes 2 , 5 , 8 , and 11 ) represents the GST - CDC ~ BHS , GST - Racl , GST - TCIO , and GST - CDC ~ ~ HS ~ ' " ' ~ with sen & the GTPyS - bound state . B , co - precipitation of E . coli - expressed Dbl . Further support for Dbl functioning as a classical GRF came from studies with a CDC42Hs mutant , where the threonine residue at position 17 was changed to an asparagine residue . When a similar mutation was made in Ras ( by changing a serine to asparagine at position 17 ) , a dominant - negative mu - tant was generated because the protein formed a tight complex with the Ras - GRF that could not be reversed by GTP ( 20 ) . Fig . lB shows that CDC ~ ~ HS * ~ " - ' ~ formed a tight complex with Dbl ( lane 10 ) that was not reversed by either GDP ( lane 11 ) or GTPyS ( lane 12 ) . The ability of Dbl to form tight complexes with the GDP - bound forms of Rho - subtype proteins was predictive of its abil - ity to stimulate GDP dissociation ( Fig . 2 ) . S . frugiperdu cells expressing Dbl strongly stimulated GDP dissociation from the Escherichia coli - expressed GST - CDC42Hs ( Fig . 2A ) . In the ab - sence of Dbl , the half - time for GDP dissociation from CDC42Hs was > 40 min at 23 " C , compared with 5 - 6 min in the presence of Dbl . Direct comparisons of E . coli recombinant CDC42Hs and CDC42Hs expressed in the baculovirus system or purified from human platelets indicated no significant differences in their abilities to respond to Dbl - containing lysates ( data not shown ) . Thus , posttranslational geranyl - geranylation of the carboxyl - terminal cysteine of CDC42Hs ( 21 ) , which does not occur in E . coli , is not essential for functional interactions with Dbl . Dbl also was able to stimulate the rate of GDP dissociation from the RhoA protein ( Fig . 2B ) , although the rates for the Dbl - catalyzed GDP dissociation were typically 2 - fold greater for CDC42Hs compared with RhoA . Under the same conditions , Dbl showed little or no effect on the rate of GDP dissociation from the Racl ( Fig . 2 A ) or TClO protein ( Fig . 2B ) , despite the fact that the predicted sequence similarity of each to CDC42Hs ( 70 and 60 % , respectively ) was greater than that of RhoA , which is only 50 % identical to CDC42Hs ( 13 ) . Previous studies have indicated that small deletions or amino acid substitutions throughout the region of Dbl that shares sequence similarity with CDC24 and a number of po - tential regulators of cell growth ( designated the Dbl domain ) inactivate Dbl transforming function ( 5 ) . Such mutants ( Fig . 3 ) were either expressed in NIH3T3 transfectants or recombi - nantly expressed in S . frugiperda cells , immunoprecipitated , and analyzed for their respective ability to stimulate GDP dis - sociation from CDC42Hs ( Table I ) .

Db1A6 - 6 contains amino acid residues IIIRDII instead of LLLKELL . DblAam , DblA67M87 , and DblAW7 + l3 were expressed in NIH3T3 cells while DblA50H18 , DblA66P670 , and GST - Db1A876925 were expressed in S . frugiperda cells . The immunopre - cipitated Dbl samples were resuspended in 20 nm Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 5 , 1 ~ l l ~ EDTA , 1 nm dithiothreitol ( 75 pl ) and then assayed ( 20 pl ) for their ability to stimulate the dissociation of I3H1GDP from CDC42Hs ( in the presence of 20 m MgC12 ) for 18 min at mom temperature . Western blot analysis indicated that equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated on - cogenic Dbl and different Dbl mutants were being compared . The sample designated " CDC42Hs alone " ( line 1 ) represents experiments performed in a manner identical to those performed using oncogenic Dbl or Dbl mutants , except that the initial immunoprecipitations were done with control NIH3T3 cells or S . frugiperda cells that do not express Dbl . ( line 2 ) immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cells and from S . fiugiperda The GDP dissociaiton activities were measured for " Oncogenic Dbl " cells that express the oncogenic Dbl protein . We find no significant differences in the activities of oncogenic Dbl immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cells or from S . frugiperda cells . The relative amount of L3H1GDP still bound to GST - CDC42Hs in the absence of Dbl ( or the Dbl mutants ) was set at 1 . 00 . As shown in Fig . 2A , less than 10 % of the bound [ 3H ] GDP dissociates from CDC42Hs , alone , under these experi - mental conditions . In the cases of the control ( line 1 ) and oncogenic Dbl ( line 2 ) , 12 and 11 determinations , respectively , were averaged , and the error bars represent the standard error of the determinations . In all other cases , the data represent the average of two determinations ( the ranges are indicated ) . that even when a conservative change was made within this region of Dbl ( ie . LLLKELL to IIIRDII ) , the transformation capability was markedly reduced ( 5 ) and there was no detect - able stimulation of GDP dissociation . Table I also presents examples of two changes that were made outside of the Dbl domain , one that represented a dele - tion of 6 amino acids ( just 50 amino acids downstream from the Dbl domain ) and the other that represented the removal of 50 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus ( see Fig . 3 ) . Both of these mutants were fully transforming ( 51 , and both showed complete stimulation of GDP dissociation from Cdc42Hs . Given the apparent importance of the Dbl domain for stimu - lating GDP dissociation , we sought to determine whether this domain was sufficient for GRF activity . Both Dbl and a trun - cated form that essentially comprised just the Dbl domain ( resi - dues 498 - 757 , designated Dbl - H ) were expressed in S . fiugi - perda cells as GST - fusion proteins and then highly purified by glutathione - agarose chromatography ( Fig . 4A ) . Fig . 4B shows that the purified GST - Dbl protein was capable of effectively stimulating the dissociation of GDP from the GST - CDC42Hs . Specifically , little or no GDP dissociation from GST - CDC42Hs was observed over a period of 20 min in the absence of Dbl , whereas in the presence of Dbl , the half - time for GDP disso - ciation was - 8 min . Under comparable experimental condi - tions , similar results were obtained with insect cell lysates containing Dbl ( e . g . Fig . 2A ) . Purified GST - Dbl acted catalyti - cally to stimulate the dissociation of r3H1GDP , i . e . 65 % of the total CDC42Hs molecules had lost labeled nucleotide within the time period of the experiment under conditions where the ratio of [ CDC42Hs ] to [ Dbl ] was 20 : l .

Right , SDS - polyacrylamide gel ( 10 % ) electrophoresis of the E , coli expressed GST - CDC42Hs ( 4 pg ) and the S . frugiperda - expressed GST - Dbl ( 2 pg ) and GST - Dbl domain ( GST - Dbl - H ) ( 1 pg ) as visualized by silver staining . In many cases , we observe proteolytic fragments of the GST - Dbl and GST - Dbl - H domains that run close to the dye front ( not shown ) . B , the time course for [ 3HlGDP dissociation from the E . coli GST - CDC42Hs ( - 2 pg ) measured in the presence of 2 pg of GST , alone ( O ) , or in the presence of 0 . 2 pg of oncogenic Dbl ( W ) or 1 . 5 pg of Dbl - H ( A ) . 4B , purified GST - Dbl - H also showed similar maximal GDP dis - sociation activity , although the amount required to yield results comparable with those obtained with GST - Dbl varied from about a 2 - fold excess of Dbl - H ( relative to GST - Dbl ) to a 6 - fold excess . These differences may reflect instability of the Dbl do - main , perhaps due to an increased tendency of the domain to aggregate . Our present findings demonstrate that the Dbl protein is a GRF and that the essential GRF domain is localized to a region shared with CDC24 ( 221 , Bcr ( 81 , the mammalian Ras - GRF ( 111 , and the ect2 ( 9 ) and uau ( 10 ) oncogene products . These findings suggest that these other proteins are likely to act as GRFs for members of the Ras superfamily of GTP - binding pro - teins . Neither the Ras - GRF ( 11 ) nor Ect2 ( 9 ) acts as a GRF for CDC42Hs , Racl , or RhoA , although a recent report suggests that Vav participates in the stimulation of the GDP - GTP ex - change activity of Ras upon T cell activation ( 14 ) . Thus far , we have not found either full - length Bcr , full - length Vav , or onco - genic Vav to stimulate GDP dissociation from CDC42Hs , Racl , 12 . 13 . 14 . 15 . 16 . 17 . 18 . 19 . 20 . 21 . 22 . 23 . 24 . 25 . 26 . 21 . 28 RhoA , or Ras ( data not shown ) . However , it is possible that some type of posttranslational modification ( e . g . phosphoryla - tion ) is necessary for the Dbl domains to become accessible on these different proteins . We have established that Dbl is effective in stimulating the dissociation of GDP from RhoA as well as CDC42Hs but not from the Racl and TClO proteins . This pattern differs from those of GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPS ) that couple to CDC42Hs , Racl , and RhoA . Human platelet CDC42Hs - GAP ( 231 , Bcr ( 24 , 251 , and the S . cereuisiae protein Bem3 ( 26 ) each stimulate the GTPase activities of CDC42Hs and Racl to simi - lar extents but either show little ( CDC ~ ~ HS - GAP , Bem3 ) or no activity ( Bcr ) on RhoA . These results suggest that CDC42Hs and RhoA contain similar GRF - binding domains but distinct GAP - binding domains , whereas the CDC42Hs and Rac pro - teins bind to similar GAPS but distinct GRFs . Previous studies have shown that Dbl exhibits a cytoskeletal distribution ( 21 , and rho - like proteins appear to be involved in the maintenance of cell polarity and shape , as well as possibly in the induction of cytokinesis ( 7 , 27 , 28 ) . Our findings demonstrating that Dbl acts as a GRF for more than one Rho - like protein , combined with the evidence that a common domain is essential both for its GRF activity and transformation , raise the question as to which of its Rho - like protein interactions is responsible for mediating Dbl transforming function .
