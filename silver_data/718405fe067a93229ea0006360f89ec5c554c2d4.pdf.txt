Our aim here is to identify the relationship of Src kinase with CD44 - signalling . Although CD44 is implicated in the invasion of cancer cells , its role in invadopodia formation needs further elucidation . Materials and Methods To study the role of Src , PC3 cells were transfected with Src constructs by adenoviral - mediated delivery . Gela - tin degradation assay was performed to determine the invasive property of PC3 cells . Immunoblotting and immunostaining analyses were used to determine complex interaction of proteins with CD44 . PC3 cells knockdown of CD44 were used to characterize the function of CD44 in invadopodia formation and invasion . Results In this study , we show that expression of constitutively - active Src in prostate cancer 3 ( PC3 ) cells significantly increased the invasiveness of PC3 cells via increasing the number of in - vadopodia as a result of CD44 - associ - ated complex ( Src - Cortactin - Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein WASP ) forma tion . The inhibition of invado - podial structures in CD44 knockdown PC3 cells resulted in reduced invasion . Conclusion Based on these results , we conclude that CD44 - Src - cortactin - WASP is an invasion promoting complex . Pro - teins in this complex are relevant targets for intervening invadopodia formation and migration / invasion processes in prostate cancer cells . Introduction Prostate cancer is a disease of extensive metastases , with secondary lesions in lymph nodes , bones and sometimes in visceral organs , including liver , lungs and even the brain . Actin dynamics is a critical process that modulates cellular activity via regulation of sig - nalling pathways through receptors and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . CD44 is a cell surface receptor and regulator of cell migra - tion and tumour metastasis 1 – 5 . We have shown pre viously in prostate cancer cells ( PC3 ) that surface ex - pression of CD44 and formation of CD44 - Matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) complex generates motility enhancing signals through the degra - dation of ECM proteins 6 , 7 . These cells use invadopodia - like structures for invasion into ECM . Localisation of MMP9 in the invadopodia assists in the focal degradation of matrix dur - ing invasion 7 . Signalling and actin - binding pro - teins ( e . g . Src , cortactin , WASP and Arp2 / 3 ) have been shown to con - tribute to the formation of invado - podia 8 – 12 . CD44 receptor has the potential to inte grate adhesive and signalling activities to modulate migration / invasion processes dur - ing cancer progression . CD44 shares some properties with the integrin receptor . Similar to integrin , the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 asso - ciates with several proteins involved in signalling and actin dynamics 13 , 14 . However , the role of CD44 in the form ation of invadopodia is not clear . PC3 cells knockdown of MMP9 ( PC3 / MMP9 - / - ) are highly adhe - sive which is due to the expression of highly glycosylated CD44 variant isoform v6 . These cells are less invasive due to a deficiency in the expression of standard CD44 ( CD44s ) and failure in the formation inva - dopodia 2 . Pertinent to proteins that CD44 interacts with , it is highly possible that CD44 might regulate the formation of invadopodia . There - fore , we hypothesise that similar to integrins , CD44 associates with proteins involved in signalling , and these , in turn , are associated with actin and actin - binding proteins . We show here that Src has a direct role in the formation of invadopodia through its interaction with CD44 . CD44 - associated signalling complex ( Src , WASP , cortactin and Arp2 / 3 ) regulates the process of actin poly - merisation involved in invadopodia formation . Materials and Methods The protocol of this study has been approved by the relevant ethical committee related to our institution in which it was performed . Antibodies towards CD44 , MMP9 , Src , WASP , cortactin and cortactin ( Y421 ) were bought from Santo Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . An antibody towards phospho - Src Y418 was obtained from Cell Signalling ( Beverly , MA ) . Rhoda - mine phalloidin and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma . CY2 and CY3 conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immuno Research Laborato - ries , Inc . ( West Grove , PA ) .

OA Cancer 2013 Nov 01 ; 1 ( 2 ) : 14 . Cell lines used for studies and culture conditions PC3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Manas - sas , VA ) . Stable PC3 cells expressing control scrambled RNA interference ( RNAi ) and short hairpin ( shRNA ) constructs to knock down CD44 ( PC3 / CD44 - / - ) were generated as described previously 15 . These cells were cultured in RPMI - 1640 media containing 10 % FBS at 37°C as des cribed earlier 16 . Preparation of cell lysates , cell surface labelling by biotinylation , immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting PC3 cells were treated with an Src in - hibitor ( PP2 ; 100 nM ) or transfected with Src constructs ( constitutively active ( CA ) and kinase - defective ( KD ) Src ) by adenoviral mediated delivery for 48 – 72 h as described previously 17 . Surface labelling with NHS - biotin , preparation of cell lysates with RIPA lysis buffer , immunoblotting ( 25 – 50 µg ) , as well as immunoprecipitation / immuno blotting ( 100 – 200 µg ) analyses were done ess entially as described in earlier study 6 . Immunohistochemistry and actin staining Cells were cultured onto cover slips in a 6 - or 12 - well dish for 14 – 16 h at 37°C . Cells were immunostained with antibodies of interest or stained for actin with rhodamine phalloidin as described previously 2 , 6 . Cells were scanned in a Bio - Rad 6000 ( Hercules , CA ) confocal microscope and images were processed by the Adobe Photo - shop program ( Adobe Systems , Inc . , Mountain View , CA ) . Measurement of F - actin content using rhodamine phalloidin binding to PC3 cells PC3 cells cultured in 24 culture plates were subjected to various treatments . For each treatment , six wells were used . Cells were labelled with rhodamine phalloidin ( 1 : 200 ) and processed as described previously 18 . Gelatin degradation and wound healing assays Gelatin degradation was per - formed essentially as described previously 6 . Statistical analysis All values presented as mean ± SEM . A value of p < 0 . 05 was considered significant . Statistical significance was determined by analysis of vari - ance ( ANOVA ) with the Bonferonni corrections ( Instat for IBM ; Graph pad software ) . Results Src regulates the formation of invadopodia in PC3 cells To determine the functional signifi - cance of c - Src in the formation of inva - dopodia , PC3 cells were infected with adenovirus containing CA - and KD - Src as shown previously 17 . An increase in the phosphorylation of Src at Y418 corresponds with the increased lev - els of Src in PC3 cells transfected with CA - Src ( Figure 1A and B , lane 1 ) as compared with control cells ( Figure 1A and B , lane 3 ) . Src phosphoryla - tion in PC3 cells expressing KD - Src is significantly lower ( Figure 1B , lane 2 ) than the control cells ( Figure 1B , lane 3 ) , although the expression levels of KD - Src and CA - Src are equal ( Figure 1A , lanes 1 and 2 ) . Actin staining in these cells dis - played an increase in the number of invadopodia in CA - Src expressing cells ( Figure 1C ) as compared with untransfected ( - ) cells ( Figure 1E ) . An increase in the number of invadopo - dia corresponds with an increase in Figure 1 : Src regulates invadopodia formation .

OA Cancer 2013 Nov 01 ; 1 ( 2 ) : 14 . F - actin content in PC3 cells express - ing CA - Src ( Figure 1F ) . The number of invadopodia and F - actin content are significantly reduced below the control levels in KD - Src expressing cells ( Figure 1D and F ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Src has a role in actin dynamics invol ved in the formation of invadopodia . Src regulates surface expression of CD44 We subsequently determined the possible biochemical mechanisms by which Src may play a role in the regulation of invadopodia formation via CD44 . PC3 cells surface labelled with NHS - biotin after various treat - ments were immunoprecipitated with a CD44 antibody or a non - immune serum ( NI ) . An increase in the surface expression of CD44 ( Figure 2B , lane 3 ) corresponds with an increase in the phosphorylation of CD44 - associated Src at Y418 ( Figure 2C , lane 3 ) and ser - ine phosphorylation of CD44 ( lane 3 in Figure 2D ) in PC3 cells expressing CA - Src . A significant decre ase below the control level ( lane 2 in Figure 2B – D ) was observed in the studied param - eters in PC3 cells exp ressing KD - Src ( lane 4 ; Figure 2B – D ) . Equal level of CD44 protein expression was observed regardless of the treatment ( Figure 2A , lanes 2 – 4 ) . The mechanisms by which Src regulates CD44 surface expression needs further study . Src regulates CD44 - associated complex formation We proceeded to determine the role of Src in CD44 - associated complex formation . We show here that Src regulates the phosphorylation state of WASP and cortactin ( Figure 3A and B , lane 1 ) . A significant decrease in the phosphorylation below the control level ( lane 3 ) was observed in cells expressing KD - Src ( Figure 3A and B ; lane 2 ) . Similar result was observed in cells treated with an Src inhibitor ( PP2 ; lane 4 in Figure 3A ) . To evaluate the role of Src in CD44 - associated signalling complex formation , lysates ( 400 µg protein ) made from PC3 cells expressing CA - and KD - Src were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to CD44 . The proteins in the complex were resolved equally in two SDS - PAGE analyses and trans - ferred to membranes for immuno - blotting analyses . Blots were probed first with an antibody towards CD44 ( Figure 3C ) and WASP ( Figure 3D ) . Subsequently , these blots were stripped and blotted , respectively , with an anti - body towards cortactin ( Figure 3E ) and Src ( Figure 3F ) . Expression of CA - Src increases the interaction of WASP and cortactin with CD44 . Interaction of these proteins is very minimal in cells expressing KD - Src ( Figure 3D and E ) . Consistent with the observation shown in Figure 2 , Src interacts with CD44 . This interac - tion is seen more in cells expressing CA - Src and less or not observed in KD - Src expressing cells ( Figure 3F ) . To ensure whether similar interac - tion occurs in the invadopodia of PC3 cells , co - immunostaining of CD44 ( green ) was performed with WASP , actin , cortactin phospho - specific anti - body towards Y421 ( p - Cortactin ) and Src ( Figure 3G ) . It should be noted that specific co - localisation of CD44 ( green ) with WASP , actin , p - cortactin and Src was observed in the invado - podia of PC3 cells . The staining levels of individual protein are varied in the cytoplasm and membrane ( Figure 3G ) . Knockdown of CD44 and expression of KD - Src in PC3 cells reduces the invasive property of PC3 cells We have shown earlier that invadopo - dia forms a focal degradation on the gelatin matrix 7 . The effect of the ex - pression of CA - Src and KD - Src as well as the knockdown of CD44 in the regu - lation of matrix degradation was de - termined ( Figure 4 ) . An increase in the number of invadopodia corresponds with the invasive nature of PC3 cells expressing CA - Src ( Figures 1C and 4C ) . The depth and surface area of degra - dation was found to be more in CA - Src ( Figure 4C ) expressing cells than control cells ( Figure 4A ; scramble ) . As shown previously 2 , neither focal adhe - sions nor invadopodia were observed in PC3 cells stably knockdown of CD44 ( Figure 4B ) . Knockdown of CD44 and expression of KD - Src ( Figure 4D ) has the potential to decrease the invasive property of PC3 cells ( B and D ) . Discussion Changes in the phenotype and ar - chitecture of cytoskeleton in PC3 / MMP9 - / - suggest that CD44 may play a role in the formation of inva - dopodia and invasion in PC3 cells 2 . Therefore , to best characterise the function of CD44 in invadopodia formation and invasion / migration processes , we used PC3 cells to stably knockdown of CD44 . Neither inva - dopodia nor focal adhesions were Figure 2 : Src regulates CD44 phosphorylation on serine residues and surface expression . Equal amount of protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with an antibody to CD44 ( lanes 2 – 4 ) and non - immune serum ( NI ; lane 1 ) . CD44 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an antibody to CD44 ( A ) , streptavidin HRP ( B ) , Y418 Src ( C ) and p - serine ( D ) antibody after stripping sequentially . Immunoprecipitation of equal amount of CD44 in panel ( A ) serves as a loading control . Results shown are representative of three different experiments .

Cortactin phosphorylation is upregulated by oncogenes ( e . g . Src ) and growth factors and it was shown to play a role in bone metastasis of breast cancer cells 22 , 23 . Cortactin phosphorylated on Y421 is identified in the invadopodia of PC3 cells . WASP - cortactin constitutes two distinct classes of Arp2 / 3 modulators . WASP is localised in the invadopodia of PC3 cells 7 . Phosphorylation of Y291 in WASP increases the affinity of VCA - domain to Arp2 / 3 proteins and actin monomers , increasing actin polymerisation in osteoclasts 17 , 24 . Weaver et al . have shown that when cortactin was added in combination with the active VCA - fragment of WASP , they synergistically enhanced Arp2 / 3 - induced actin filament bran - ching . Cortactin has been shown to stabilise WASP - Arp2 / 3 complexes 25 , 26 . Inhibition of Src activity with PP2 or expression of KD - Src reduces the in - teraction of WASP and cortactin with CD44 . Cortactin and WASP phos - phorylation by Src seems a required mechanism for CD44 associated complex formation . CD44 interaction with Src promotes cytoskeletal reorga - nisation through cortactin and Rho activation ( Figure 5 ) as shown by others 27 . Conclusion Our results suggest that CD44 - Src - cortactin - WASP - Arp2 / 3 axis plays an important role in the formation of invadopodia . Src also has a role in the surface expression of CD44 , which indicates that Src activation may occur independent of CD44 but dependent on integrin signal - ling . Additional experiments are needed to determine how Src in - creases the levels of CD44 on the cell surface . We conclude that reducing Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin and WASP or depletion of one of the components ( e . g . CD44 or cortactin ) of ternary complex Figure 3 : Src regulates CD44 - associated complex formation .

These results represent one of three experiments performed with the same results . observed in these cells . Knockdown of CD44 transforms highly invasive PC3 cells into a less adhesive / invasive cellular phenotype . Integrins play or - ganisational roles in the adhesion and formation of invadopodia 19 . Integrin αvβ3 is expressed in PC3 6 as well as PC3 / MMP9 - / - and PC3 / CD44 - / - cells ( data not shown ) . However , in - tegrin αvβ3 is not able to compensate for CD44 deficiency in the organisation of invadopodia in PC3 / MMP9 - / - and PC3 / CD44 - / - cells . Taken together , these observations suggest the im - portance of CD44 and the link be - tween CD44 and actin dynamics in the organisation of invadopodia . Highly invasive cancer cells and Src - transformed cells display actin - enriched invadopodia 20 . Src kinase is the most ubiquitously expressed non - receptor tyrosine kinase . Src has been shown to localise in the invado - podia of mammary carcinoma cells where it specifically mediates the phosphorylation of cortactin .
