The breakthrough rate depends on the rate at which an inventor generates inventions and the probability that each of these inventions is a break - through . We argue that inventors with larger patent records generate a higher rate of inventions , but the single inventions that they generate each have a lower probability of being a breakthrough . Longitudinal data of 5 , 144 European inventors and ﬁxed - effects estimation conﬁrm these predictions and reveal that the net effect of the inventors’ stock of past inven - tions on the breakthrough rate is positive—that is , more established inventors display a higher rate of breakthroughs than brand - new inventors . We also conﬁrm the role of organizational contexts in shaping inventors’ productivity . In particular , ﬁrms’ control over research and development targets lessens the advantage of established inventors with regard to the rate of breakthrough generation . Keywords : breakthrough inventions ; R & D organization ; individual inventors ; inventive experience History : Published online in Articles in Advance December 23 , 2013 . Introduction Innovation is at the core of ﬁrms’ competitive advan - tage in knowledge - based industries . However , achieving and sustaining a competitive edge through innovation is not easy . First , not all inventions are alike ; many inven - tions are not worthy of much attention , and only a few outliers are breakthroughs—that is , inventions that the technological community recognizes as highly valuable ( Ahuja and Lampert 2001 ) . 1 Second , modern compet - itive contexts demand that ﬁrms consistently produce breakthroughs over time to maintain or increase their competitive advantage ( e . g . , D’Aveni 1994 , Shilling and Hill 1998 ) . Thus , ﬁrms are increasingly required to boost their rate of breakthrough generation , which entails two components : the rate of invention and the probability of any invention being a breakthrough . Extant research contributions related to breakthrough inventions focus on the breakthrough rate as a whole , without disentangling its two components ( see Ahuja and Lampert 2001 ) , or else they consider only the probability of any invention being a breakthrough ( see Singh and Fleming 2010 ) . In doing so , they neglect an inherent trade - off in the process leading to break - throughs ( March 1991 ) . Increasing the invention rate typically relies on the exploitation and reﬁnement of well - known paths ( e . g . , Sørensen and Stuart 2000 ) , whereas raising the probability that any invention is a breakthrough often demands the exploration of “outside - the - box” approaches ( e . g . , Azoulay et al . 2011 ) . This study tries to shed light on this tension , as it arises from the ﬁrm decision to rely on established inventors ( or employees with a strong record of past inventions ) versus brand - new inventors ( with few or no inventions ) . The former are typically provided with a vast repertoire of well - known heuristics to exploit ( Chase and Simon 1973 ) , whereas the latter are naturally more receptive to exploring fresh ways of thinking ( Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010 ) . We posit that established inventors tend to follow familiar paths ( Audia and Goncalo 2007 , Levinthal and March 1993 , Rhee and Haunshild 2006 ) , which leads to a higher invention rate than that produced by brand - new inventors but also lowers the probability that any given invention that they produce is extremely valuable . Because of these contrasting forces , whether inventors with a greater stock of past inventions are in a bet - ter or worse position to generate a consistent ﬂow of breakthroughs is theoretically ambiguous . However , the organization of research and development ( R & D ) might 833 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 .

In particular , a ﬁrm’s cru - cial decision in designing R & D processes is whether to retain control over R & D goals and centrally set spe - ciﬁc targets or to allow inventors to ﬁx their own goals independently ( Aghion et al . 2008 , Stern 2004 , Panico 2009 ) . We hypothesize that when R & D targets are cen - trally deﬁned , inventors with a greater record of past inventions display a lower rate of breakthrough gener - ation compared with situations in which they choose their targets autonomously . The reason is that the dis - advantages of a centrally targeted R & D , in terms of lower autonomy ( e . g . , Cardinal 2001 ) and performance appraisal pressure ( e . g . , Staw et al . 1981 ) , are partic - ularly salient for established inventors . In contrast , the beneﬁts , in terms of guidance and supervision through - out the inventive process ( e . g . , Stokes 1999 ) , should be particularly pronounced for brand - new inventors . We test our theory with data about 5 , 144 European inventors , drawn from the PatVal - EU survey , which includes the universe of granted European Patent Ofﬁce ( EPO ) patents during 1993 – 1997 . The PatVal - EU survey also contains information about inventors’ age , mobility , type of employer , and characteristics of R & D projects . For the purposes of this study , we reconstruct the patent history of each inventor in the survey from 1978 , or the year the EPO began receiving patent applications , to 1999 . Our test includes three steps . First , we employ a survival regression model to examine the relation - ship between the individual stock of past inventions and inventive rate . Second , through a linear probabil - ity model , we analyze how prior creative output affects the likelihood that an invention is a breakthrough . Third , using a survival regression model , we estimate how the stock of inventions affects inventors’ rate of break - through generation . The empirical analysis uses individ - ual ﬁxed effects to control for unobserved individual fac - tors ( e . g . , innate ability ) that remain constant over time and may inﬂuence both creative performance and the stock of past ideas . The results show that the net effect of the stock of past inventions on the breakthrough rate is positive : more established inventors display a higher rate of breakthroughs than brand - new inventors . How - ever , when organizations retain control over R & D tar - gets , the positive relationship between inventors’ past invention records and rate of breakthrough generation decreases . This study contributes to R & D organization and inno - vation literature in several ways . First , we add to the recent stream of organization research that focuses on invention as an outcome with multilevel antecedents that combine to affect invention outcomes ( e . g . , Gupta et al . 2007 ) . Corporate inventors do not operate in a vacuum ; they are embedded in an organizational context that shapes their behavior and performance . In this regard , this study shows that ﬁrms’ control over R & D targets moderates the impact of individual abilities on invention outcomes . Second , we complement extant research on how indi - vidual skills inﬂuence ﬁrm inventive capability ( e . g . , Lacetera et al . 2004 ) . The design of an R & D strategy implies a decision about not only how much to invest but also how and whom to invest in , because the way ﬁrms allocate resources among corporate inventors determines the outcome of their R & D processes ( Cabral 2000 ) . In particular , our ﬁndings reveal that allocating more resources to the most proliﬁc inventors may be associ - ated with a signiﬁcant change in both the productivity and the direction of a ﬁrm’s R & D efforts . Third , we address an issue that has been widely debated in creativity and innovation literature—namely , the choice between experienced and inexperienced indi - vidual researchers . Most prior studies address the extent to which ideas are novel or how much they diverge from past solutions ( e . g . , Argote and Miron - Spektor 2011 , Audia and Goncalo 2007 , Gino et al . 2010 ) . We complement this research by focusing on breakthroughs ( i . e . , highly valuable inventions , regardless of their nov - elty ) and consider both the breakthrough rate and its components . Fourth , we offer insights for the research on break - through inventions ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lampert 2001 , Girotra et al . 2010 , Singh and Fleming 2010 ) . Specif - ically , we show the importance of disentangling the drivers of the rate of breakthrough inventions into its two components , the rate of inventions on the one hand and the probability of any invention being a breakthrough on the other . Doing so improves our understanding of the overall process for generating breakthrough inven - tions . In particular , we show that the same factors that hamper the likelihood of any single invention being a breakthrough can enhance the breakthrough rate . The rest of this article proceeds as follows : In the next section , we derive our theoretical predictions . After we describe our data and empirical strategy , we provide the results . We conclude with a discussion of the implica - tions of our ﬁndings . Theory and Hypotheses Corporate Inventor Experience and the Rate of Breakthrough Generation In modern environments , competitive advantage is increasingly transitory . Intense rivalry , the continual rise of appealing substitute products , and fragmented and ﬁckle customer tastes all contribute to a state of con - stant disequilibrium ( D’Aveni 1994 ) , such that most ﬁrms’ proﬁts derive from inventions produced in the very recent past ( Shilling and Hill 1998 ) . In this sce - nario , successful ﬁrms are those able to increase the pace of inventions , to move from one competitive position D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 .

Conti , Gambardella , and Mariani : Inventors , Organizations , and Breakthrough Inventions Organization Science 25 ( 3 ) , pp . 833 – 849 , ©2014 INFORMS 835 to another amid the turbulence . However , the positive skew of the invention value distribution is marked , such that many inventions are not worthy , and only a few are extremely valuable ( Harhoff et al . 1999 ) . Consis - tent with prior literature ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lampert 2001 ) , we deﬁne breakthroughs as extremely valuable inven - tions whose importance is reﬂected in the recognition they receive from the technological community . Break - throughs enable ﬁrms to challenge the existing techno - logical order ( Tushman and Anderson 1986 ) or engage in corporate renewal , business growth , and new business development ( Ahuja and Lampert 2001 ) . Because of both hypercompetition and the positive skew of the invention value distribution , ﬁrms have an incentive to exploit their resources to generate a con - sistent stream of breakthrough inventions—that is , to increase their rate of breakthrough generation . To this end , while leveraging their internal human resources in the quest for breakthroughs , ﬁrms must decide whether to rely more on inventors with a strong record of past inventions ( i . e . , established inventors ) or on inventors with no or few past inventions ( i . e . , brand - new inven - tors ) . This decision has been widely debated in creativity literature , which has focused on the impact of past cre - ative outcomes on the extent to which inventors’ ideas diverge from their current knowledge trajectory ( e . g . , Audia and Goncalo 2007 , Gino et al . 2010 ) . Yet the effect of inventors’ past invention records on the rate of breakthrough generation , which is jointly determined by the rate of invention and the probability of any invention being a breakthrough , 2 has not been studied previously . We argue that the stock of past inventions induces inventors to exploit familiar approaches rather than explore new paths . This choice has crucial implications for the returns on their inventive activity ( March 1991 ) . On the one hand , exploiting well - known approaches ensures a reasonable payoff in a short amount of time ; that is , it increases the rate at which inventions are generated ( Sørensen and Stuart 2000 ) . On the other hand , exploring novel paths likely raises the probability that any invention generated is a technological break - through . Inventors thinking “outside the box” draw from an invention value distribution that is not only more uncertain ( which implies higher variance ) but also more valuable ( Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010 , Manso 2011 ) . Both a higher variance and a greater expected value increase the likelihood of any invention being a break - through ( Girotra et al . 2010 ) . Established inventors are more likely to exploit famil - iar approaches for several reasons . First , with their past stock of inventions , such inventors’ idea generation heuristics are well consolidated ( Chase and Simon 1973 ) and effective for increasing the speed at which new inventions get produced ( Audia and Goncalo 2007 ) . In addition , for established inventors , following a “myopic” path could be particularly convenient if the adoption of new paths implies some sunk costs ( Levinthal and March 1993 ) . In this case , the net beneﬁts of any novel approach could be inferior to the gross bene - ﬁts of old approaches whose sunk costs have already been paid . These two arguments suggest that , compared with brand - new inventors , established inventors are both more effective and more efﬁcient when exploiting famil - iar approaches . Accordingly , they may want to allo - cate their time and effort to exploitative projects close to their extant competences . Furthermore , a “reputation effect” may reinforce the established inventors’ incen - tive to choose exploitative paths . Because of their vast track record of inventions , these inventors’ better rep - utational position might result in even stronger moti - vations to search for safe solutions ; failure entails a greater reputational loss for such researchers ( e . g . , Rhee and Haunshild 2006 ) . For example , consider an inven - tor confronted with the choice between developing a new antidepressant based on a serotonin inhibitor or developing one based on a substance P receptor blocker approach ( Cabral 2000 ) . The ﬁrst approach would pro - vide a low probability of failure but a limited payoff in the case of success because of the incremental nature of the invention . The second path would imply the promise of a substantial payoff in the case of success as well as a signiﬁcant probability of failure because it would represent a radical invention . Because of their higher reputational capital , established inventors would face a stronger social penalty in the case of failure , which may lead them to safer , albeit less valuable , choices . All in all , we predict that established inventors , by relying on well - known approaches , display a higher rate of invention and a lower likelihood of any inven - tion being a breakthrough compared with brand - new inventors . Hypothesis 1 . The larger the inventor’s stock of past inventions , the higher the rate of new invention generation . Hypothesis 2 . The larger the inventor’s stock of past inventions , the lower the probability that a future inven - tion is a breakthrough . Considering the trade - off that results from corpo - rate inventors’ prior output , organizations that aim to increase the rate of breakthrough generation face a crit - ical tension when allocating their ( scarce ) resources among inventors . On the one hand , allocating resources to the most proliﬁc inventors increases the inventive rate , because these inventors likely exploit well - known approaches and display a higher invention rate . On the other hand , such an allocation diminishes the likelihood of any new invention being extremely valuable , because breakthroughs result from outside - the - box thinking .

Unfortunately , it is difﬁcult to predict ex ante which effect will dom - inate , as exempliﬁed by the old diatribe regarding the relative importance of “quantity versus quality” in the creative process . The evolutionary theory of creativ - ity offers one perspective , arguing that producing high - impact contributions is a probabilistic function of quan - tity ( Dennis 1966 , Simonton 1997 ) . Consistent with this view , it is far easier to affect the sheer quantity of inventions than their value , which remains largely unpre - dictable ( Mariani and Romanelli 2007 ) . According to this line of reasoning , the impact of any factor on the breakthrough rate is largely mediated by its impact on the quantity of inventions generated rather than on the value of any particular invention . It follows that the posi - tive effect of the stock of past inventions on the inventive rate is stronger than the negative effect on the probabil - ity of any invention being a breakthrough . As a result , established inventors have a higher rate of breakthrough generation . Some scholars disagree with this emphasis on the “quantity effect” to produce breakthroughs . For exam - ple , Fleming ( 2007 , p . 70 ) suggests that in the quest for breakthroughs , enhancing the average value of inventions is at least as important as increasing the sheer number of inventions : “Organizations rarely invent breakthroughs if their average shot is worth little . ” Accordingly , he highlights the importance of individual ( and organizational ) factors in determining the inven - tion value in general and the likelihood of any invention being a breakthrough in particular . We conclude that whether established inventors are in a better position than brand - new inventors to increase the production of breakthroughs on a consistent basis is a theoretically ambiguous question , and we thus formulate two concurrent hypotheses . Hypothesis 3A . The larger the inventor’s stock of past inventions , the higher the rate of breakthrough generation . Hypothesis 3B . The larger the inventor’s stock of past inventions , the lower the rate of breakthrough generation . The organization of R & D might mitigate or solve the trade - off resulting from inventors’ prior inventive output . Although new ideas are inherent to individu - als , the organizational design of the R & D structure and processes inﬂuence the intensity , direction , and produc - tivity of inventors’ efforts ( Ahuja et al . 2008 ) . Firms might decide to start projects with a clear target cen - trally deﬁned , or they might fund people without limiting ex ante the scope and latitude of their research trajec - tories ( e . g . , Azoulay et al . 2011 ) . In the next section , we examine this distinction to draw testable implications about the moderating role of the nature of R & D on the relationship between successful inventive experience and the generation of breakthrough inventions . The Moderating Role of R & D Organization : Managerial Control Over R & D Target A major challenge for ﬁrms designing the internal orga - nization of R & D is how much control to exert over R & D ( e . g . , Aghion et al . 2008 , Stern 2004 ) . Control refers to “any process by which managers direct atten - tion , motivate , and encourage organizational members to act in desired ways to meet the ﬁrm’s objectives” ( Car - dinal 2001 , p . 22 ) . Such a broad deﬁnition encompasses many dimensions of R & D control . For example , it could involve the extent to which employees are allowed to dis - close the ﬁndings of research or even the extent to which they can access cutting - edge equipment without asking for permission ( Stern 2004 ) . However , the most promi - nent dimension of control is probably whether ﬁrms or corporate inventors decide on the topics and direction of research projects ( Panico 2009 ) . In this respect , ﬁrms might decide to establish a clear invention problem and ask inventors to ﬁnd a solution ( what we call “centrally targeted R & D” ) ; alternatively , they might decide to let inventors pursue the research paths they prefer . Genzyme , a successful biotechnology company ac - quired recently by Sanoﬁ , represents a clear example of centrally targeted R & D . Genzyme’s goal is to cap - ture value from the treatments of rare diseases caused by enzyme deﬁciency conditions , which usually afﬂict a very small percentage of the world’s population . How - ever , because of the severity of the disorders and the absence of effective treatments , ﬁnding a therapy would be extremely proﬁtable . Therefore , Genzyme’s R & D efforts are primarily devoted to ﬁnding drugs that cure these speciﬁc diseases . Instead , in companies such as Google and 3M , researchers enjoy great autonomy regarding the choice of R & D target . Google’s well - known philosophy of “20 % time” allows engineers to spend 20 % of their working hours pursuing projects that are not necessar - ily in their job scope , without formal control . Similarly , employees at 3M can spend up to 15 % of their time pursuing individual projects of their own choice , without needing to justify or disclose the project to a manager . Allocating corporate inventors to a centrally targeted R & D project might affect both the sheer quantity of inventions produced and the likelihood of any invention being breakthrough . In this respect , two sets of argu - ments produce opposite expectations . The ﬁrst suggests that centrally targeted R & D could be detrimental to both the quantity of inventions and the probability of any of them being a breakthrough . The rate of inventions may decrease because ﬁrm con - trol over the R & D targets limits the autonomy of inven - tors to allocate efforts and resources : any choice about the strategy to achieve the target , or about switching to a new target , requires managerial approval . Hence , inventions become more difﬁcult to produce , because D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Conti , Gambardella , and Mariani : Inventors , Organizations , and Breakthrough Inventions Organization Science 25 ( 3 ) , pp . 833 – 849 , ©2014 INFORMS 837 they require negotiations and discussions with man - agers ( Azoulay et al . 2011 ) . Centrally targeted R & D also implies the dissipation of many potentially valu - able ideas that never become inventions because , accord - ing to the managers , they do not conform to the target ( and so are not relevant for the organization ) or are less proﬁtable than other alternatives proposed ( Stern 2004 , Aghion et al . 2008 ) . Also , the probability of any inven - tion being a breakthrough may decrease because strict control by higher - level managers could exert psycho - logical constraints to produce high - impact inventions . Employees in these stressful situations may overexploit their knowledge—that is , choose incremental solutions based on their extant competences—even when doing so does not bring about any beneﬁt ( Cowen 1952 , Staw et al . 1981 ) . A second set of arguments suggests instead that cen - trally targeted R & D might enhance both the invention rate and the probability of any invention being a break - through . With regard to the invention rate , a target outcome imposed by a third party can act as a ref - erence for inventors . It therefore increases perceptions of competence and encourages inventors to complete the task ( Dahl and Moreau 2007 ) . Moreover , because too much choice can paralyze decision making ( Iyengar and Lepper 2000 ) , imposing constraints , such as a clear goal or speciﬁc instructions , can avoid the “blank - page” effect in creative work ( Stokes 1999 ) . Regarding the likelihood of any invention being a breakthrough , man - agerial control over the R & D objective , by directing the scope of search , may limit the combination of overly diverse knowledge elements , which often results in awk - ward outputs ( Taylor and Greve 2006 ) . We argue that the ﬁrst set of arguments prevails in the case of established inventors , whereas the second set likely prevails among brand - new inventors . In other words , the beneﬁts associated with centrally targeted projects are particularly salient for brand - new inventors , leading them to produce more inventions that are more likely to be valuable . The disadvantages instead should be especially pronounced for established inventors , who become less productive in terms of both the inventive rate and the probability of any invention being a break - through . Brand - new inventors lack the competence to manage the inventive process efﬁciently and thus beneﬁt from a target outcome as a form of encouragement ( Dahl and Moreau 2007 ) . Furthermore , they have not already developed their own research trajectory , and with no constraints on targets , they could easily become over - whelmed by the choice among a large number of goals ( Iyengar and Lepper 2000 , Stokes 1999 ) . Because of their tendency toward exploratory attitudes , brand - new inventors also frequently confront dead ends . More dis - cipline and limitations on the paths they may pursue thus might be beneﬁcial and help them avoid awkward or worthless combinations ( Taylor and Greve 2006 ) . In contrast , established inventors , with their proﬁ - ciency and expertise , do not beneﬁt much from man - agerial supervision and guidance . Instead , the need to discuss and negotiate with managers about any new tar - get that they would like to propose , or even the best way to achieve the established target ( Azoulay et al . 2011 ) , makes their stocks of past inventions a less productive asset . Established inventors cannot leverage their consol - idated heuristics to generate ideas as much as they would without any ﬁrm control . Analogously , managerial selec - tions of ideas that eventually will become inventions may imply a greater penalty for established inventors than for brand - new inventors . In the most likely case , among the many ideas for achieving a certain cen - trally ﬁxed target , managers select only the solution that seems the most proﬁtable to them ( Aghion et al . 2008 ) . The loss , in terms of the number of ideas discarded , is clearly greater for established inventors , in that they are able to propose more solutions . Furthermore , estab - lished inventors confronted with strict managerial con - trol are prone to overexploit their past approaches ( Staw et al . 1981 ) . Unlike brand - new inventors , they possess well - established ways of thinking , which lead them , in stressful situations , to “play it safer” than is optimal ; this translates into a lower probability that any invention is a breakthrough . Therefore , we hypothesize the following . Hypothesis 4 . Being allocated to a centrally tar - geted R & D project negatively moderates the relationship between the individual stock of past inventions and the rate of new invention generation . Hypothesis 5 . Being allocated to a centrally tar - geted R & D project negatively moderates the relationship between the individual stock of past inventions and the probability that a future invention is a breakthrough . In terms of the rate of breakthrough generation , the previous two hypotheses suggest that centrally targeted R & D produces a penalty for inventors with greater records of past inventions , in that both their inven - tive rate and the likelihood of any invention being a breakthrough decrease . As a result , ﬁrms’ control over the R & D target reduces the trade - off determined by inventors’ stock of past inventions , such that established inventors assigned to a centrally targeted R & D project display a lower breakthrough rate than when they are free to pursue independent research paths . We thus pre - dict the following . Hypothesis 6 . Being allocated to a centrally tar - geted R & D project negatively moderates the relationship between the individual stock of past inventions and the rate of breakthrough generation ; that is , if the relation - ship between the stock of past inventions and the rate of breakthrough generation is positive ( Hypothesis 3A ) , it becomes less positive . If it is negative ( Hypothesis 3B ) , it becomes more negative . D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 .

The PatVal - EU survey , conducted in 2003 – 2004 , includes inventors of 9 , 550 patents granted by the EPO . The population of patents from which we selected the target sample consists of all EPO - granted patents with priority date between 1993 and 1997 . Unlike previous patent surveys , this approach represents the entire universe of patents in European Union ( EU ) countries and all technological ﬁelds . The survey collects information about the indi - vidual inventors , their employer organizations , inventive processes , and the resulting patents . For the surveyed inventors , we downloaded all EPO patents on which they were listed before 1999 and collected the names of all coinventors . The appendix describes the sampling pro - cess , as well as the procedures for identifying PatVal - EU inventors and their coinventors . For the purpose of this study , we consider inventors employed in private companies ( rather than in research organizations ) and drop inventors for whom we lack information about the year of birth , education , year in which they achieved their degree , type of employer , or mobility . The ﬁnal sample covers 5 , 144 inventors for whom we had full information records and complete patenting histories . The observation window starts in 1978 , the year the EPO began receiving patent applica - tions , and runs through 1999 . We ended the data col - lection in 1999 to ensure sufﬁcient time to measure the patented inventions’ value , according to the number of forward citations received . For each patent , we collected information about the technological ( International Patent Classiﬁcation , or IPC ) class , the name of coinventors , and the date of the application ( day , month , and year ) . If two or more patents were ﬁled on the same date , we dropped the one with fewer forward citations . In the end , we obtained 35 , 005 patents that listed the inven - tors in our sample . We then traced the inventors’ careers from their beginning ; the entry date of an inventor in our sample is 1978 if she achieved the highest educa - tional degree before this year , or the year she received the highest educational degree otherwise . At the inven - tor level , our data cover 40 , 149 observation spells , each of which starts after a new invention ( or the beginning of the inventor’s career ) and ends with another invention or censoring . Measures Dependent Variables . To test our theory , we esti - mate three equations with different dependent variables . The ﬁrst , INVENTION , is the rate at which an inven - tor produces a generic patented invention . The second dependent variable , BREAKTHROUGH _ INVENTION , is a dichotomous variable that takes a value of 1 if the invention is a breakthrough and 0 otherwise . We con - sider the rate at which an inventor produces break - throughs as a third dependent variable . Breakthroughs refer to patented inventions in the top 5 % of the dis - tribution in terms of citations received from subsequent patents ( Ahuja and Lampert 2001 , Phene et al . 2005 , Singh and Fleming 2010 ) . Thus , we employ a dichoto - mous variable that takes a value of 1 if the patent is in the top 5 % of the distribution of EPO patents invented in the same year ( application date ) and in the same ISI - INPI - OST technological category , and 0 otherwise . 3 The number of citations a patent receives correlates with other measures of its technological and economic value , including consumer surplus ( Trajtenberg 1990 ) , patent renewal rates ( Harhoff et al . 1999 ) , contribution to ﬁrm market value ( Hall et al . 2005 ) , and inventor assessments of its economic value ( Gambardella et al . 2008 ) . Of the 35 , 005 patents in our sample , 2055 are breakthroughs , according to our measure . Explanatory Variables . STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVEN - TIONS is the number of patents the inventor applied for in the past . 4 Because this output - based measure of expe - rience may also proxy for inventor ability , we include inventor ﬁxed effects to capture the effect of the inventor experience , net of other innate characteristics . To test the moderation effect produced by being allo - cated in a CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D project , we draw on information provided by the survey . Speciﬁ - cally , if the idea originated outside the ﬁrm’s control , such as one that came from an individual inventor’s inspiration , we regard the inventor as employed in a noncentrally ( or independently ) targeted R & D activity . In contrast , if the invention was the main achievement or a by - product of a ﬁrm - sanctioned research project , we regard the inventor as involved in a centrally tar - geted R & D project . Because this information is avail - able only for the surveyed patents , and because a small fraction of the inventors in our sample have more than one PatVal - EU patent , we use the inventor average of this variable , as provided by the surveyed patents , to deﬁne the targeted nature of all the other ( unsurveyed ) projects of the same inventor in the same organization , and we exclude mobile inventors from the sample when we introduce the interaction term . In the Robustness Checks section , we provide evidence for the reliability of our measure . This measure is largely time invariant , which could create a problem if we sought to estimate the effect of a centrally targeted R & D project per se in a regression with ﬁxed effects for each inventor . However , because we are interested in the interaction between the R & D decentralization and the stock of past inventions , we can use the inventors’ ﬁxed effects to exploit dif - ferences both within inventors ( i . e . , change in the stock D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 .

In other words , we can compare the effect of being allocated to targeted versus untargeted R & D projects for inventors who have undergone the same change in their experience . Controls . TECH _ DIVERSITY measures the dispersion of the stock of past inventions across diverse technolog - ical ﬁelds , corresponding to the following indicator : TECH _ DIVERSITY i = 1 − (cid:88) k (cid:18) n k n (cid:19) 2 (cid:49) where n is the total number of patents , and n k is the number of patents in each of the 129 IPC3 technological classes k . 5 We then include controls for INVENTOR _ AGE , which might inﬂuence both the quantity and the quality of inventions ( e . g . , Hall et al . 2007 , Jones 2010 , Levin and Stephan 1991 ) . 6 We also control for inventors’ MOBIL - ITY , or the number of times an inventor changes employ - ers in a speciﬁc period . To control for other sources of ideas and knowledge from which the inventor might beneﬁt , we include a measure of SOCIAL _ DIVERSITY , or the ratio of different coinventors listed on the focal inventor’s patents to the total number of collaborations . For example , if an inventor patented with 10 coinven - tors and 5 are different people , this measure equals 0 . 5 . The number of different coinventors thus accounts for exposure to this form of diverse experience . At the organizational level , we control for the type of employer , which may change over time in the case of mobile inventors : large ( i . e . , more than 250 employees ) , medium ( between 100 and 250 employees ) , or small ﬁrms ( fewer than 100 employees ) . The corresponding dum - mies are LARGE _ FIRM _ DUMMY , MEDIUM _ FIRM _ DUMMY , and SMALL _ FIRM _ DUMMY , respectively . Finally , because time - varying factors may inﬂuence the invention process , all our estimates include dummy variables for the calendar year and technological classes . Table 1 lists these variables , along with their deﬁnitions . Empirical Strategy Our empirical study involves two levels of analysis : inventor ( Hypotheses 1 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) and invention ( Hypotheses 2 and 5 ) . To test Hypotheses 1 and 4 , which pertain to the inventive rate , we use an event his - tory analysis rather than count models . Count models constrain the events to occur in an arbitrarily chosen period ( i . e . , calendar year ) , and they also assume that the unconditional rate of event occurrence is constant ( e . g . , King 1989 ) , which represents an unrealistic assump - tion for creative processes because productivity likely changes over the course of an inventor’s career . 7 Fur - thermore , count models assume that events in any period are independent of one another , which is not accurate for our context , because prior productivity clearly can affect current invention rates . Because we have data about the day of the EPO patent application , as our baseline spec - iﬁcation we use a continuous Cox regression model ( see Sørensen and Stuart 2000 ) . The Cox model does not make parametric assumptions about the form of dura - tion dependence in the hazard rate , which is impor - tant because incorrect parametric assumptions may lead to biased estimates of the effects of the covariates on the hazard rate ( Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995 ) . In a Cox model , the hazard rate is the product of an unspeciﬁed baseline rate h(cid:52)t(cid:53) and a term that speciﬁes the inﬂuences of covariates in X : HazardRate t = h(cid:52)e(cid:53) exp (cid:52)(cid:130)x(cid:53)(cid:48) ( 1 ) To test Hypotheses 1 and 4 , the dependent variable in Equation ( 1 ) is the rate at which inventor i generates new inventions—that is , the inventor’s hazard inventive rate at time t . We use the STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS ( before time t ) as our explanatory variable to test Hypothesis 1 . We then use the interaction between the STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS and CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D to test Hypothesis 4 . We therefore estimate the following equation : INV _ RATE it = f (cid:52) STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS it (cid:49) STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS it × CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D it (cid:49) controls (cid:53)(cid:48) ( 2 ) To control for omitted variables at the individual level , we also employ a survival ﬁxed - effects estimation , strat - iﬁed across individual inventors , and remove dummy variable coefﬁcients from the partial likelihood function ( Allison 1996 ) . The estimation produces an approach similar to the conditional maximum likelihood for logis - tic regressions . Allison ( 2002 ) shows that this estimation produces approximately unbiased estimates for a wide variety of conditions , which makes it preferable to a sim - pler dummy variable model . To correct for intragroup correlations across errors , we compute robust standard errors for all speciﬁcations . To test Hypotheses 2 and 5 ( regarding the probabil - ity that any invention is a breakthrough ) , we estimate a second equation that employs a dichotomous dependent variable , equal to 1 if invention j , generated by inven - tor i at time t , is a breakthrough ( 0 otherwise ) : BKT _ PROB it = f (cid:52) STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS it (cid:49) STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS it × CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D it (cid:49) controls (cid:53)(cid:48) ( 3 ) We use a linear regression model rather than a logis - tic ( or probit ) model for three reasons . First , a linear probability model provides a direct estimate of the inter - action between the stock of past invention and the tar - geted nature of R & D .

Third , the potential bias of the linear probability model is greatly reduced or even null ( Horrace and Oaxaca 2006 ) , because the predicted prob - abilities lie between 0 and 1 . Hypotheses 3 and 6 refer to the rate of breakthroughs . We employ Cox regression models with the inventor as the unit of the analysis .

The large number of observations in our sample reduces concerns about mul - ticollinearity . Table 4 provides the estimated results of the three equations . All regressions employ inventor ﬁxed effects . Speciﬁcation 1 includes only the stock of past inven - tions , in addition to the control variables , and tests Hypotheses 1 – 3 . Speciﬁcation 2 includes information about centrally targeted R & D and its interaction with the stock of past inventions to test Hypotheses 4 – 6 . In this second speciﬁcation , we restrict the analysis to the sample of nonmobile inventors—that is , inven - tors who do not change employers during their career . This restriction actually extends our measure of targeted R & D ( which pertains to the surveyed projects ) to other projects pursued by the inventor within the same organi - zation . This conservative decision reduces the number of observations compared with speciﬁcation 1 . Clearly , the variables for inventors’ mobility and types of organiza - tions cannot be estimated . In a robustness check , we use the sample of observations that includes mobile inven - tors but limit the patents to those applied for during the time considered by the survey ( e . g . , after 1993 ) , with no relevant changes in the results . Our key explanatory variable , STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS , shows a positive effect on the rate of invention ( INV _ RATE ) , and the correlation is statisti - cally signiﬁcant at the 1 % level , which provides sup - port for Hypothesis 1 . In particular , a 1 % increase in the stock of past inventions produces a 1 . 62 % increase in the inventive rate ( speciﬁcation 1 . 1 ) . In support of Hypothesis 2 , the STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS is negatively correlated with the probability that an inven - tion is a breakthrough ( PROB _ BKT ) . A 1 % increase in the stock of recent patents decreases the likelihood of a single invention being a breakthrough by 0 . 02 percentage points ( speciﬁcation 1 . 2 ) . To determine the rate of generation of breakthroughs , speciﬁcation 1 . 3 in Table 4 shows which of the two effects prevails . The STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS exerts a positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect on the rate of break - throughs ( BKT _ RATE ) ; a 1 % increase in the stock of past inventions increases the breakthrough rate by approximately 1 . 37 % . This ﬁnding supports Hypothe - sis 3A , because the positive effect of the stock of past inventions on the invention rate is stronger than the neg - ative effect on the probability of any invention being a breakthrough . Our theory also posits that the nature of the research projects in which the inventors are involved moderates the effect of successful inventive experi - ence .

STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS . The estimated results for STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS conﬁrm the pos - itive effect of successful inventive experience on both the inventive rate ( INV _ RATE ) and the breakthrough rate ( BKT _ RATE ) ( see speciﬁcations 2 . 1 and 2 . 3 , respectively , in Table 4 ) , as well as the negative corre - lation with the probability of producing a breakthrough ( speciﬁcation 2 . 2 in Table 4 ) , although this effect is sta - tistically not signiﬁcant . However , the effect of the STOCK _ OF _ PAST _ INVENTIONS is negatively moderated by inventors being employed in CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D projects . The sign of the interacted term is negative and statistically signiﬁcant at the 1 % level on the rate of invention generation ( INV _ RATE ) : the over - all effect of prior inventive output on the rate at which inventors produce inventions remains positive , but its magnitude decreases when they are employed in R & D projects whose goals are centrally established ex ante . This ﬁnding provides support for Hypothesis 4 . Hypothesis 5 is also conﬁrmed . When established inven - tors are employed in targeted R & D projects , the prob - ability that any invention is a breakthrough decreases ( speciﬁcation 2 . 2 ) . As a result , consistent with Hypoth - esis 6 , when established inventors are allocated to a centrally targeted R & D , the breakthrough rate , although positive overall , decreases ( speciﬁcation 2 . 3 ) . The signs of the other covariates mostly conform to our expectations and are consistent across speciﬁcations . Inventors employed in CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D projects display a higher inventive rate , and there are no statistically signiﬁcant effects on the probability that an invention is a breakthrough or on the rate of generation of breakthroughs . Mobile inventors show a lower inven - tive rate , but there is no statistically signiﬁcant effect on either the probability of producing a breakthrough or the rate at which breakthroughs are produced . The TECH _ DIVERSITY variable correlates negatively with the inventive rate and the rate of breakthrough genera - tion , whereas the effect on the probability of an inven - tion being a breakthrough is not statistically signiﬁcant .

The variable SOCIAL _ DIVERSITY has a positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect on both the inventive and breakthrough rates , but it has no impact on the probability that an invention is extremely valuable . The INVENTOR _ AGE of the inventors exerts a signiﬁcantly negative effect on inventions’ productivity and a positive , although not statistically signiﬁcant , effect on the proba - bility of any invention being a breakthrough . The overall effect remains negative on the rate of breakthrough gen - eration ( speciﬁcations 1 . 3 and 2 . 3 in Table 4 ) . Robustness Checks A limitation of our empirical test is that the measure of centrally targeted R & D is available for the surveyed patents only . We therefore assume that the R & D projects in the PatVal - EU survey are representative of all R & D projects undertaken by the same inventor in the same organization , and we use the average of the variable for unsurveyed projects by each inventor . In support of this approach , we note that the PatVal - EU survey randomly picked patents from the entire patent population , which implies that the population characteristics of the R & D projects should be well represented by the random sam - ple . Furthermore , the reliability of our measure increases as the number of inventions realized by each inventor decreases ; at the extreme , if an inventor had produced only the inventions surveyed in PatVal - EU survey , our measure would be totally reliable . In truth , most inven - tors in the sample produce only one or two inventions throughout their careers . However , to exclude the possibility that our ﬁnd - ings are driven by a misuse of the variable measuring R & D centralization , we perform two robustness checks . First , to relax the assumption that the type of R & D project reported in the survey is representative of all other projects developed earlier by the same inventor in the same organization , we use the sample of patents applied for during the time period considered by the survey only ( i . e . , those applied for after 1993 ) and replicate the regressions in Table 4 . In this case , we also include mobile inventors and control for mobility . For this sample , the entry date of the survival anal - ysis is the date of the last invention before 1993 for inventors that had already patented before this date ; for those without patents before 1993 , the entry date is the year in which they arguably started working . Our esti - mated results ( available from the authors upon request ) are fully consistent with those in Table 4 , suggest - ing that the assumption about the use of the targeted R & D indicator does not produce biases in the estimated results . Second , we provide evidence that the potential measurement error associated with our assumption is marginal , because managerial control over the R & D tar - get is largely path dependent and consistent across a ﬁrm’s projects . For a smaller sample of inventors for which we have multiple surveyed inventions , we esti - mate two linear probability models . The dependent vari - able is whether their latest patent is the result of a CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D project . The covariates common to both speciﬁcations are the inventor’s age , the number of past inventions , mobility , technological and social diversity , the type of employer organization , and the technological and year dummies . One speciﬁ - cation also uses a variable that indicates whether the previous patent was the outcome of a CENTRALLY _ TARGETED _ R & D project . Table 5 presents the esti - mated results of both regressions . The linear probability model in speciﬁcation 1 . 1 in Table 5 explains only 13 % of the variance in the depen - dent variable . When we add information about the nature of the inventor’s previous project , whether centrally tar - geted or not , we can explain 27 % of this variance ( spec - iﬁcation 1 . 2 ) . The added variable is also the most impor - tant ( in terms of magnitude ) and statistically signiﬁcant predictor of whether inventors are employed in similar subsequent projects . An additional concern pertains to alternative explana - tions consistent with our ﬁndings , such as the positive correlation between the inventors’ stock of past inven - tions and the inventive rate . It might be that success - ful inventors receive more resources , which increases their productivity . To rule out this potential explana - tion , we use information drawn from the PatVal - EU sur - vey about the monetary resources ( MONETARY _ COST ) allocated to the speciﬁc R & D project in which the inven - tor has been employed , and that led to the surveyed patent . We then regress this variable on the past stock of inventions and control for individual ﬁxed effects . Speciﬁcation 1 . 3 in Table 5 shows that the relation - ship between inventors’ past inventive output and the resources they receive is statistically not signiﬁcant , which works against the interpretation that more produc - tive inventors receive greater endowments that in turn increase their productivity . We also check whether our results are robust to the inclusion of age and mobility as dummy variables . We deﬁne the age of the inventors by using three dummy variables : one for inventors younger than 40 years old , another for inventors between 40 and 50 years old , and the last one for inventors older than 50 years old . MOBILITY equals 1 if the inventor has changed employ - ers before the date of the focal patent , and 0 otherwise . The estimates ( see Table 6 ) conﬁrm our results . Furthermore , we check whether established inventors , with their more exploitative search mode , tend to draw from a distribution with both lower expected value and D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 .

Thus we perform two regressions . With a ﬁrst Poisson regression , we aim to capture the impact of experience on the expected value of the inventions ; the dependent variable is the number of forward citations received by each patent in the sam - ple , after controlling for year and technology dummies . Then , in an ordinary least squares regression , we seek to determine the impact of experience on the variance of the patent value . The dependent variable in this case is the ( log ) square of residuals of the ﬁrst regression . The estimated results ( available from the authors upon request ) indicate that the stock of past inventions , both per se and in interaction with ﬁrm control over the R & D goal , correlates negatively with the expected value of the inventions and their variance . Finally , we check whether our results are robust to dif - ferent thresholds for deﬁning breakthrough inventions . In addition to the top 5 % of the distribution of patents applied in the same year and technological class , we employ a top 2 % cutoff for inventions in the same value distribution . We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant changes in the esti - mated results . Discussion and Conclusions This study analyzes whether the individual stock of past inventions affects the rate of breakthrough generation and how ﬁrms’ control over R & D targets moderates this relationship . On average , inventors with a stronger record of inventions display a higher inventive rate and thus are more likely to achieve a breakthrough in a given time interval . However , the positive impact of prior out - put decreases when organizations allocate inventors to R & D projects with a centrally deﬁned target , rather than allowing them to pursue independent research avenues . Our study in turn contributes to extant literature in sev - eral ways . First , it contributes to organization research by focusing on invention as the outcome of multilevel antecedents that interact . Despite some recent contri - butions treating invention as a multilevel phenomenon , there is still little empirical work that describes how fac - tors from different organizational levels interact to deter - mine the quantity and type of resulting inventions ( e . g . , Gupta et al . 2007 ) . Our study shows that the organiza - tional context in which corporate inventors are embed - ded shapes their behavior and performance .

Second , this study provides insights into how individ - ual skills may shape ﬁrm R & D outcomes ( e . g . , Lacetera et al . 2004 ) . Firm inventive performance is determined by the amount of resources dedicated to R & D . However , designing an R & D strategy means choosing not only how much to invest but also how and whom to invest in Cabral ( 2000 ) . In this respect , a key decision is the allo - cation of resources to inventors endowed with different abilities . We show that the way resources are allocated may condition the intensity and the direction of R & D activity . Third , this study relates to literature pertaining to the effect of experience on creative output . Previous contri - butions have focused on the generation of novel ideas , deﬁned by the extent to which they diverge from past solutions ( e . g . , Audia and Goncalo 2007 , Gino et al . 2010 ) . In relation to these contributions , our study shifts the focus of analysis to address breakthrough inven - tions as the outcome of interest , deﬁned by their impact and recognition in the technological community rather than their novelty . Furthermore , we investigate inven - tors’ rates of breakthrough generation , rather than the probability of any single invention being a breakthrough ( which , together with the inventive rate , still is one of the components of the breakthrough rate ) . With our dif - ferent focus , our results complement previous ﬁndings . For example , prior research concludes that inventions by more proliﬁc inventors are less likely to be novel ( e . g . , Audia and Goncalo 2007 ) . However , when inven - tors reapply their direct task experience in teams , con - trolling for any reputation effect , experience leads to more novel inventions ( Gino et al . 2010 ) . We show that more established inventors also display a higher break - through rate because of their higher inventive rate .

Conti , Gambardella , and Mariani : Inventors , Organizations , and Breakthrough Inventions 846 Organization Science 25 ( 3 ) , pp . 833 – 849 , ©2014 INFORMS would be interesting to explore whether our ﬁnding also holds for the rate of production of novel ideas to deter - mine whether and in what situations allocating resources to proliﬁc inventors might counteract ﬁrm technological obsolescence . Fourth and ﬁnally , this study contributes to research aimed at understanding the determinants of break - throughs ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lampert 2001 , Girotra et al . 2010 , Singh and Fleming 2010 ) . We argue the rate of breakthroughs depends on factors that affect both the probability that an invention is a breakthrough and the inventive rate . Moreover , we show that the same factors that hamper the likelihood of any single invention being a breakthrough can enhance the breakthrough rate . In this respect , our study contributes to the debate about the relationship between the total number of individ - ual ideas and the value of that person’s best ideas ( e . g . , Dennis 1966 , Simonton 1999 ) . In particular , we ﬁnd evi - dence that the rate of breakthrough generation is largely inﬂuenced by factors that inﬂuence the number of ideas , rather than their value . This study also has some limitations . One issue is that the use of archival data prevents the determination of causality . Some of the controls that we use ( e . g . , type of employer , inventor age ) , as well as some of our robust - ness checks , partially address this concern . Yet we cannot guarantee that the stock of patents produced in the past increases the ability to generate new ideas , rather than just the ability to produce “patentable” inventions . Nev - ertheless , unreported analyses ( available from the authors upon request ) show that the patentability of inventions produced by established inventors is not signiﬁcantly greater than the patentability of those produced by brand - new inventors . 8 In addition , because we lack data about the resources spent to achieve a breakthrough , we can - not make deﬁnitive statements about efﬁciency . To over - come these limitations , additional research should adopt an experimental approach that treats experience in cre - ative tasks exogenously , as Gino et al . ( 2010 ) do at the team level . Furthermore , our deﬁnition ( and measure ) of break - throughs may sound deterministic . However , we build on a consolidated stream of literature that deﬁnes break - throughs as inventions lying on the right - hand tail of the invention value distribution and that measures break - throughs as a ﬁxed percentage of extremely valuable inventions ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lampert 2001 , Phene et al . 2005 , Singh and Fleming 2010 ) . This deﬁnition cap - tures the idea that , because of the skewed distribution of inventions , only a few are ever really valuable for companies . Finally , by construction , our sample does not include any R & D project that has not produced ( at least ) one patented invention . Therefore , our ﬁndings should be interpreted conditional on the project having produced at least one patented invention . This issue appears unlikely to cause any major problems in our study , though , as the set of controls that we introduce and the estimation method are intended to lessen , if not solve , this potential issue . Despite these limitations , our study offers notable managerial implications . The ﬁrst implication pertains to the optimal allocation of resources between established and brand - new inventors . Our theory and empirical ﬁnd - ings both suggest that ﬁrms should rely on brand - new inventors when trying to pick one breakthrough out of a sample of ideas or inventions . For example , compa - nies increasingly launch competitions , open to exter - nal participants , for inventive ideas , with the best idea eventually being ﬁnanced and developed ( e . g . , Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010 ) . Our ﬁndings indicate that a com - pany’s best strategy may be to select ideas produced by brand - new inventors . In contrast , in more traditional internal R & D processes , ﬁrms do not just consider one breakthrough ; rather , they try to enhance the number of breakthroughs that inventors produce in any given time interval . In this case , the most effective strategy for increasing the rate of breakthroughs is to rely on estab - lished inventors . On average , the greater inventive rate of established inventors overcomes the higher value of inventions generated by brand - new inventors . However , when companies assign inventors to centrally targeted R & D projects , the productivity of established inventors diminishes , along with their abilities to rapidly gener - ate a breakthrough . Our argument applies to the process leading to breakthrough inventions , which do not nec - essarily correspond to novel ( or divergent ) inventions ; that is , established inventors might increase the rate of breakthrough generation by building on consolidated tra - jectories , rather than by exploring novel paths . Compa - nies could try to resolve the trade - off between the higher inventive rate of established inventors and the higher impact of inventions produced by brand - new inventors by designing R & D teams composed of both types of inventors . However , further analysis is required to deter - mine the extent to which mixed R & D teams actually represent an optimal solution . Our research also revamps insights into how to man - age and organize the invention process , particularly for breakthrough inventions . The results highlight the impor - tance of factors that inﬂuence the rate of breakthrough generation by affecting the rate of invention , not just the value of single inventions . Overall , it seems that any factor inﬂuences the rate of breakthrough mainly through the inventive rate rather than through the proba - bility of any invention being a breakthrough . For exam - ple , social diversity has a positive impact on the inven - tive rate , probably because it provides inventors with access to a broader set of knowledge and skills ; this translates into a higher breakthrough rate as well . In this respect , a further implication of our study is that ﬁrms should seriously consider invention strategies based on D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 .

The extent to which organizations should exploit such order statistic effects to achieve break - throughs is beyond the scope of this research . We leave it as an intriguing question for further studies .

Appendix PatVal - EU Sampling Procedure For a complete description of the PatVal - EU sampling proce - dure , see Giuri et al . ( 2007 ) ; this appendix provides a brief summary . The population of patents from which we selected our target sample consists of all EPO - granted patents with pri - ority between 1993 and 1997 . We ﬁrst assigned these patents to countries according to the location of the ﬁrst inventor listed . At the time of the survey , patents from France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Spain , and the United Kingdom represented 42 . 2 % of total EPO patents by country of ﬁrst inventor , and 88 . 0 % of the EPO patents indicated a country of the ﬁrst inven - tor from among the EU - 15 . The share of questionnaires sub - mitted to inventors in each country reﬂects the country share of patents in the overall population . 9 To address the highly skewed distribution of patent values , we oversampled “impor - tant” patents , or patents that had been opposed or received at least one citation , which produced approximately 15 % addi - tional observations for these patents at the aggregate EU - 6 level ( 43 . 2 % ) , compared with the initial population ( 28 . 5 % ) . Our goal was to obtain 10 , 000 usable questionnaires from the inventors , with target numbers of 3 , 500 from Germany , 1 , 750 from France , 1 , 750 from the United Kingdom , 1 , 250 from Italy , 1 , 250 from the Netherlands , and 500 from Spain . The response rate in the pilot surveys determined the num - ber of questionnaires to send to the inventors in each coun - try to obtain returns close to these targets . In the end , we selected a stratiﬁed sample of 27 , 531 EPO patents comprising all opposed or cited patents from 1993 to 1997 , as well as a random sample of uncited and unopposed patents from the same period . The response rate was 32 . 75 % . Identifying Inventors and Coinventors We performed the procedure 10 to provide a unique identiﬁer for PatVal - EU inventors and their coinventors and to match inventors with their patents on the EPOLINE patent database of the European Patent Ofﬁce that covers more than 1 , 260 , 000 patent ﬁles with application dates ranging from June 1978 to July 2002 . We performed the identiﬁcation using several cri - teria ( i . e . , inventor’s last name , inventor’s ﬁrst name and part of it , street and / or city address , IPC code , name of the patent applicant ) that we combined into 38 different subsets , each consisting of three or four criteria . The procedure matched information from the PatVal - EU patents with data displayed in the EPOLINE patents . The query was carried out using MYSQL version 4 . The MYSQL control center was applied as the SQL interface . All Java classes were constructed with Eclipse . The search resulted in 38 data sets containing poten - tial matches , each with an expected match quality , assigned according to the speciﬁc subset of criteria employed . We merged the 38 data sets into one master database and checked the records manually to remove duplicate patent applications and wrong matches . Endnotes 1 Breakthrough inventions do not necessarily correspond to highly novel inventions that diverge from existing solutions . Very novel ideas might not be technologically or economi - cally valuable ; some incremental solutions can turn out to be extremely valuable . 2 Because the breakthrough rate # Br ( i . e . , the expected number of breakthroughs in any time unit ) is equal to the inventive rate # Inn ( i . e . , the number of inventions in any time unit ) mul - tiplied by the likelihood of any invention being a breakthrough Prob Br , the impact of any variable X on the ( log of ) rate of breakthrough is equal to (cid:161) log # Br / (cid:161)X = (cid:161) log # Inn / (cid:161)X + (cid:161) logProb Br / (cid:161)X . 3 We obtain the 30 ISI - INPI - OST technologies , deﬁned by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ( ISI ) , Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle ( INPI ) , and Observatoire des Sciences and des Techniques ( OST ) , by aggregating the IPC codes . See Giuri et al . ( 2007 ) for a detailed description of the use of this classiﬁcation with PatVal - EU data . 4 We do not have information about inventive failures or unpatented inventions . However , by controlling for inventor age and professional age ( i . e . , the number of years elapsed since the inventor earned the highest education degree and the number of years of invention potential ) in robustness checks , we can compare inventors who , given their age and profes - sional experience , produced different numbers of patents over the course of their careers and therefore represent different failure rates . These results are available from the authors upon request . 5 See http : / / www . wipo . int / classiﬁcations / ipc / en / ( accessed November 25 , 2013 ) . 6 Levin and Stephan ( 1991 ) and Hall et al . ( 2007 ) examine the relationship between age and scientiﬁc productivity to solve the complicated issue of disentangling age effects from cohort effects . Because our aim is to estimate the net effect of inven - tive experience , after we control for other age - related experi - ence , we follow the identiﬁcation method adopted by Levin and Stephan ( 1991 ) so that the cohort effects are captured by individual ﬁxed effects . Similarly , we do not control for the stage of the inventors’ career ( e . g . , the number of years spent in the job ) , because this effect would be already captured by the year and inventors’ ﬁxed effects . 7 A Poisson model with age and year dummies would control for temporal changes in productivity across the overall time D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 120 . 194 . 195 ] on 21 J a nu a r y 2015 , a t 04 : 50 .

The results indicate that inventors’ experience does not correlate with any of these measures . 9 We also undersampled the share of German and French patents and oversampled patents from other countries to obtain sufﬁciently large samples for all countries . 10 This search was conducted in collaboration with Karin Hoisl ( University of Munich ) .
