Conley , Wolfgang Bergmeier Objective —The goal of this study was to investigate the potential crosstalk between Rap1 and Rac1 , 2 small GTPases central to platelet activation , particularly downstream of the collagen receptor GPVI . Methods and Results —We compared the activation response of platelets with impaired Rap signaling ( double knock - out ; deficient in both the guanine nucleotide exchange factor , CalDAG - GEFI , and the Gi - coupled receptor for ADP , P2Y12 ) , to that of wild - type platelets treated with a small - molecule Rac inhibitor , EHT 1864 ( wild - type / EHT ) . We found that Rac1 is sequentially activated downstream of Rap1 on stimulation via GPVI . In return , Rac1 provides important feedback for both CalDAG - GEFI – and P2Y12 - dependent activation of Rap1 . When analyzing platelet responses controlled by Rac1 , we observed ( 1 ) impaired lamellipodia formation , clot retraction , and granule release in both double knock - out and EHT 1864 - treated wild - type platelets ; and ( 2 ) reduced calcium store release in EHT 1864 - treated wild - type but not double knock - out platelets . Consistent with the latter finding , we identified 2 pools of Rac1 , one activated immediately downstream of GPVI and 1 activated downstream of Rap1 . Conclusion —We demonstrate important crosstalk between Rap1 and Rac1 downstream of GPVI . Whereas Rap1 signaling directly controls sustained Rac1 activation , Rac1 affects CalDAG - GEFI – and P2Y12 - dependent Rap1 activation via its role in calcium mobilization and granule / ADP release , respectively . ( Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol . 2012 ; 32 : 434 - 441 . ) Key Words : collagen (cid:1) platelets (cid:1) signal transduction (cid:1) CalDAG - GEFI (cid:1) small GTPases P latelet activation results in a series of rapid morphologi - cal events that depend on actin and are a common feature of all cell - based clotting systems across evolution . Rearrange - ments of the actin cytoskeleton are crucial for shape change , platelet - substrate ( spreading ) and platelet - platelet ( aggrega - tion ) interactions , and granule secretion . 1 The small GTPases of the Ras 2 and Rho 3 families are critical regulators of cellular activation . Small GTPases are molecular switches cycling between a GTP - bound state , able to interact with effector molecules and to initiate downstream responses , and a GDP - bound state . They are tightly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , that accel - erate the rate - limiting dissociation of GDP , and GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) , that promote the intrinsic GTPase activity and terminate signal transduction . 4 RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 , prototypical members of the Rho family , are the main regulators of actin remodeling in cells . 5 RhoA regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion contacts , 6 while Cdc42 promotes the formation of filopodial protrusions . 7 Rac induces the formation of sheet - like lamellipodial protrusions 8 and participates in exocytosis . 9 Independently of actin dynamics , Rac regulates phospho - lipase C (cid:1) 2 ( PLC (cid:1) 2 ) activation , 10 ROS generation , transcrip - tion , MAPK signaling , and cell proliferation . 3 In mammals there are 3 Rac isoforms , but only Rac1 was detected at the protein level in platelets . 11 Recent studies with knockout mouse models and small molecule inhibitors have shown that Rac1 is essential for lamellipodia formation , granule secre - tion , clot retraction , and PLC (cid:1) 2 activation in platelets . 11 – 16 Because of its role in PLC (cid:1) 2 activation , Rac1 deficient platelets are severely impaired in their response to stimulation via immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif ( ITAM ) - coupled receptors , such as the collagen receptor glycoprotein ( GP ) VI , 16 or the hemITAM receptor C - type lectin - like receptor 2 ( CLEC - 2 ) . 17 Within the Ras family , Rap GTPases are most recognized for their role in integrin activation , the regulation of cell - cell contacts , the establishment of cell polarity and the control of exocytosis . 2 , 18 , 19 In mammals , the Rap family consists of 2 rap1 genes and 3 rap2 genes encoding proteins that are approximately 65 % homologous . Platelets express significant amounts of Rap1B and Rap2B , with Rap1B accounting for approximately 90 % of the total Rap protein . 20 Loss of Rap1B inhibits integrin (cid:2) IIb (cid:3) 3 activation and platelet spreading on fibrinogen , and it impairs collagen - induced dense granule secretion . 21 In our recent work , we established a 2 - pathway Received on : March 31 , 2011 ; final version accepted on : October 31 , 2011 .

In the present study , we investigated the hypothesis that Rac1 in platelets is under the control of Rap1 . Using transgenic mice with impaired Rap signaling in combination with a novel inhibitor to Rac1 , we found that ( 1 ) downstream of the ITAM - coupled receptor , GPVI , Rap1 , and Rac1 facilitate optimal platelet activation by providing crucial feedback activation for each other , and ( 2 ) there are at least 2 ( temporally ) distinct pools of Rac1 , with only one of them controlled by Rap1 . Methods Reagents and Antibodies See the Supplemental Material , available online at http : / / atvb . ahajournals . org , for an exhaustive list of the materials used . Mice CalDAG - GEFI (cid:2) / (cid:2) (cid:3) P2Y12 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice were obtained from the intercross of CalDAG - GEFI (cid:2) / (cid:2) 25 and P2Y12 (cid:2) / (cid:2) 31 mice . Experi - mental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Thomas Jefferson University and of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Platelet Preparation Blood was drawn from the retro - orbital plexus into heparinized tubes . Platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) or washed platelets were prepared as described previously . 23 See Supplemental Methods . Small - GTPase Activation Assays Rap1 , Rap2 , and Rac1 activation were determined by pull - down assay followed by standard Western blotting procedures as described previously . 23 Rac1 - GTP was also quantified with the Rac G - LISA TM ( Absorbance Based ) Biochem kit ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) ac - cording to the manufacturer instructions . See Supplemental Methods for details . Spreading Assay Spreading of platelets on fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the GPVI agonist convulxin ( Cvx ) was performed as described in Supplemental Methods . Platelet Clot Retraction Washed murine platelets were resuspended in citrated human plate - let - poor plasma ( 4 (cid:3) 10 8 platelets / mL ) and 150 (cid:4) mol / L EHT 1864 or DMSO were added . Coagulation was triggered by addition of thrombin ( 0 . 4 U / mL ) . Clots were allowed to retract at 37°C for 1 hour . The extent of clot retraction was determined as the volume of serum extruded from the clot and expressed as percentage of the total reaction volume . Dense Granule Secretion The release of 3 H - serotonin into platelet supernatants after 10 minutes of stimulation was measured as described previously . 23 See Supplemental Methods for further details . Flow Cytometry (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 Activation and (cid:1) - Granule Secretion Washed platelets diluted in Tyrode’s buffer containing 0 . 35 % BSA and 1 mmol / L CaCl2 ( 10 8 platelets / mL ) were stimulated for 10 minutes with increasing doses of Cvx , costained with JON / A - PE 32 ( Emfret Analytics , Wuerzburg , Germany ) and (cid:2) - P - selectin - FITC ( BD Biosciences , Rockville , MD ) for 10 minutes and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry . Calcium Flux Measurement Washed platelets were incubated with 5 (cid:4) mol / L Fluo - 4 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) for 15 minutes , diluted in Tyrode’s buffer ( 10 8 platelets / mL ) containing 2 . 5 mmol / L EDTA , activated with Cvx , and analyzed for fluorescence intensity over a period of 3 minutes . Aggregometry Performed as described previously . 23 See Supplemental Methods for details . Statistics Results are reported as mean (cid:4) SD and statistical significance was assessed by unpaired 2 - tailed Student t - test . A probability value less than 0 . 05 was considered significant . Results The small GTPases Rap1 and Rac1 are critical players in platelet activation , in particular downstream of the collagen receptor GPVI . Studies in other cell systems suggest a crosstalk between Rap1 and Rac1 during cellular activation . In this study , we sought to investigate whether Rap1 - Rac1 circuits regulate platelet activation . In a first step , we evaluated the effect of impaired Rap1 signaling on the activation of Rac1 in platelets stimulated with Cvx , a snake venom toxin that specifically targets the collagen receptor GPVI ( Figure 1 ) . In WT platelets , activa - tion of both Rap1 and Rac1 was stronger at t (cid:5) 1 minute than at t (cid:5) 10 minutes after addition of Cvx . Deficiency in CalDAG - GEFI markedly reduced the activation of Rap1 and Rac1 at t (cid:5) 1 minute , while little effect was observed at t (cid:5) 10 minutes . In contrast , inhibition of P2Y12 with 2 - MesAMP reduced Rap1 and Rac1 activation both in the early and the late phase of activation . Virtually complete inhibition of Rap1 and Rac1 activation at t (cid:5) 1 minute and t (cid:5) 10 minutes was observed in 2 - MesAMP - treated CalDAG - GEFI (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets , demonstrating a strong correlation between the activation of Rap1 and Rac1 in platelets activated via GPVI ( Figure 1A , B ) . To eliminate any off - target effects of 2 - MesAMP , 33 we studied the activation of Rap1 and Rac1 in platelets isolated from mice deficient in CalDAG - GEFI and P2Y12 ( double knock - out , DKO ) ( Figure 1C , D ) . Consistent with the studies using 2 - MesAMP to block P2Y12 , we observed virtually complete inhibition of Rap1 and Rac1 activation in Cvx - activated DKO platelets , both at t (cid:5) 1 (cid:6) and 10 (cid:6) after addition of the agonist . Importantly , inhibition of (cid:2) IIb (cid:3) 3 integrin with a monoclonal antibody during the activation process did not markedly affect Stefanini et al Small GTPase Crosstalk in Platelets 435 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 10 , 2017 h tt p : / / a t vb . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Rac1 activation in WT platelets ( Supplemental Figure I ) , dem - onstrating that the contribution of Rap1 to Rac1 activation is not secondary to Rap1 - mediated integrin activation . Furthermore , DKO platelets also failed to activate the small GTPase Rap2 in response to Cvx treatment ( Supplemental Figure II ) , demonstrat - ing that all Rap signaling in platelets is under the control of CalDAG - GEFI and P2Y12 . To confirm the functional association between Rap1 and Rac1 in Cvx - stimulated platelets , we compared the platelet activation response of DKO platelets to that of WT platelets treated with the small molecule inhibitor EHT 1864 ( WT / EHT ) . Previous studies have shown that EHT 1864 specifi - cally blocks Rac , but not RhoA and Cdc42 , activation in vitro and in vivo . 34 , 35 In platelets , EHT 1864 inhibited Rac1 activation downstream of ITAM - coupled receptors 17 at a dosage of 100 (cid:4) mol / L ( Supplemental Figure III ) . Both WT / EHT and DKO platelets showed impaired spreading on a fibrinogen surface after stimulation with Cvx ( Figure 2A and 2B ) . Shape change and the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia was observed in WT platelets as early as 3 minutes after addition of Cvx . Lamellipodia formation pro - gressed continuously , leading to a more than doubling of the platelet surface area within 30 minutes of activation . In contrast , DKO or WT / EHT platelets underwent shape change and filopodia formation but failed to form lamellipodia . Consequently , their platelet surface area did not markedly increase . Importantly , we did not observe any difference in platelet surface area between DKO , WT / EHT , and DKO / EHT platelets , suggesting that both Rap1 and Rac1 are crucial for lamellipodia formation and spreading in Cvx - activated platelets . Rac1 has also been implicated in clot retraction , another actin - based mechanism initiated by integrin outside - in signaling . We could confirm this finding in WT / EHT platelets , where clot retraction was significantly delayed when compared to WT controls ( Figure 2C , D ) . Importantly , however , impaired Rap1 signaling ( DKO platelets ) had a significantly stronger inhibitory effect on clot retraction than inhibition of Rac1 , possibly because of the direct role of Rap1 in integrin activation . Next , we evaluated the ability of DKO and WT / EHT platelets to release their granules ( Figure 3 ) . Consistent with recent studies , 16 Cvx - induced release of (cid:2) granules was markedly impaired in WT / EHT platelets , in particular in response to low and medium doses of the agonist ( Figure 3A ) . At the highest tested concentration of Cvx , however , (cid:2) granule release in WT / EHT platelets was significantly re - duced but not abolished when compared to that of WT platelets . In comparison , (cid:2) granule release was completely abolished in DKO platelets at all agonist concentrations tested ( 10 - fold the EC50 for Cvx ) . Pretreatment with EHT 1864 did not affect secretion in Cvx - stimulated DKO plate - lets . Rap1 and Rac1 signaling contributed in a similar fashion to dense granule release ( Figure 3B ) . Inhibition of Rac1 signaling by EHT 1864 abolished dense granule release at low / medium but not high doses of Cvx , whereas virtually complete inhibition of dense granule release was observed in DKO platelets at all agonist concentrations tested . In contrast to spreading , clot retraction and granule release , WT / EHT , and DKO platelets did not contribute in a similar way to PLC (cid:1) 2 - mediated calcium ( Ca 2 (cid:1) ) mobilization in Cvx - stimulated platelets ( Figure 4A , B ) . Compared to WT controls , Ca 2 (cid:1) store release in WT / EHT platelets was re - duced by (cid:7) 50 % , both at low and high doses of the agonist . Ca 2 (cid:1) flux observed in DKO platelets , however , was not Figure 1 . Rap1 activation correlates with Rac1 activation in platelets .

Similar results were obtained on stimulation of platelets with an alternative GPVI - specific agonist , collagen - related peptide ( CRP ) ( Supplemental Figure IV ) , suggesting that in GPVI - stimulated platelets both Rap1 and Rac1 signaling contribute to spreading and granule release , but Rac1 alone participates in PLC (cid:1) 2 activation and subsequent Ca 2 (cid:1) mobilization . One potential explanation for this finding is that the activation of Rac1 immediately down - stream of the agonist receptor occurs independent of Rap1 . Our studies confirm this hypothesis , as we observed that at t (cid:5) 10 seconds after Cvx stimulation Rac1 activation in DKO platelets was comparable to that of WT cells , whereas Rap1 activation was completely abolished . At later time points , however , Rac1 - GTP – levels in WT platelets increase and reach a plateau after t (cid:5) 1 minute , while a sharp decrease in Rac1 activation was observed in the DKO platelets ( Figure 4C and 4D ) . Similar results were observed using a quantitative ELISA - like approach ( Supplemental Figure V ) . In our previous work , we demonstrated that Rap1 activa - tion in platelets depends on independent yet synergistic signaling by Ca 2 (cid:1) / CalDAG - GEFI and ADP / P2Y12 . 22 – 24 While signaling by Ca 2 (cid:1) / CalDAG - GEFI mediates the rapid but reversible activation of Rap1 , signaling by ADP / P2Y12 is crucial for the sustained activation of the small GTPase . Consistent with the effect of Rac1 inhibition on calcium mobilization ( Figure 4 ) and granule release ( Figure 3 ) , we observed that pretreatment of WT platelets with EHT 1864 Figure 2 .

Com - pared to WT controls , Rap1 activation in WT / EHT platelets activated with high - dose Cvx was markedly reduced at both early ( t (cid:5) 30” ) and late ( t (cid:5) 600” ) time points ( Figure 5A ) . However , it was not completely abolished and the residual activation was sufficient to facilitate (cid:2) IIb (cid:3) 3 activation and platelet aggregation ( Figure 5B – 5D ) . Discussion Our studies establish a central role for Rap1 - Rac1 signaling circuits in platelet activation ( Figure 6 ) . Downstream of the collagen receptor , GPVI , one pool of Rac1 is activated immediately and contributes to PLC (cid:1) 2 - mediated mobiliza - tion of intracellular calcium ( [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] i ) . Increased [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] i triggers CalDAG - GEFI – mediated Rap1 activation , which is crucial for the activation of a second pool of Rac1 . Sustained Rac1 activation is required for actin - dependent platelet responses such as spreading and granule release . In turn , ADP released from dense granules induces sustained activation of Rap1 via engagement of P2Y12 . Thus , a continuous crosstalk between the small GTPases , Rac1 and Rap1 , is required for optimal platelet activation down - stream of the collagen receptor GPVI . Using inhibitors to P2Y12 in combination with CalDAG - GEFI (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets , we have recently demonstrated that ( 1 ) each pathway independently contributes to Rap1 activation in activated platelets , and ( 2 ) Rap1 activation is virtually abol - ished in P2Y12 inhibitor - treated CalDAG - GEFI (cid:2) / (cid:2) plate - lets . 22 – 24 To rule out reported off - target effects of P2Y12 inhibitors in our studies , 33 we here used platelets isolated from mice deficient for both CalDAG - GEFI and P2Y12 ( DKO ) . So far , our limited breeding efforts of DKO mice from crosses of mice heterozygous for both CalDAG - GEFI and P2Y12 did not reveal increased embryonic lethality of DKO pups ( not shown ) . This finding is in contrast to the 85 % embryonic and perinatal lethality reported in Rap1B (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . 21 However , although Rap1 is widely expressed , both CalDAG - GEFI 36 and P2Y12 37 show a much more restricted expression profile . Thus , it appears likely that the increased lethality observed in Rap1B (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice is caused by impaired function of a cell type other than platelets . In addition to viability , peripheral platelet counts and platelet size in DKO mice were comparable to WT controls ( not shown ) . However , Rap1 activation and integrin - mediated aggregation were abolished in the Cvx - stimulated DKO platelets ( Figure 1 and 5 ) , confirming our recent studies with P2Y12 inhibitors . 22 , 23 Figure 4 . A distinct pool of Rac1 is activated independently of Rap1 signaling immediately after GPVI stimulation .

A prominent consequence of P2Y12 engagement is inhibition of adenylyl cylcase via G (cid:2) i . 37 Several studies , however , have documented that there is no causal relationship between adenylyl cyclase inhibition and platelet aggregation . 38 , 39 P2Y12 also leads to the activation of PI3 kinase signaling . At least part of the PI3 kinase - driven response , however , is mediated via activation of Rap1 . 40 , 41 The serine / threonine protein kinase B / Akt is another effector of PI3 kinase . It is currently not clear if Akt and Rap1 are part of the same signaling pathway or if they operate independent of each other . Although previous works have shown that Rac1 activation is dependent on an increase in [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] i and potentiated by signaling via P2Y12 , 29 , 30 the mechanism ( s ) by which Ca 2 (cid:1) and P2Y12 modulate this molecule are unknown . Our results suggest that both Ca 2 (cid:1) - and P2Y12 - dependent Rac signaling is mediated by Rap1 , as ( 1 ) we observed a strong correlation between the activation kinetics of Rap1 and Rac1 in stimulated platelets ( Figure 1 ) ; ( 2 ) sustained , but not early , Rac1 activation is abolished in DKO platelets ( Figure 4C , D ) ; ( c ) Rap1 and Rac1 mediate similar cellular responses such as spreading , clot retrac - tion , and granule release ( Figure 2 and 3 ) , and ( 4 ) the GEF activity of CalDAG - GEFI is directed toward Rap but not Rac GTPases . 36 Unfortunately , Rac1 activation has not been exam - ined in platelets from Rap1B (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . A very recent study on platelet function in Rap1B (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , however , shows a role of Rap1B in granule secretion , spreading on fibrinogen and clot retraction , but not in calcium mobilization . 42 Thus , Rap1B (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets show defects in Rac1 - dependent platelet responses , supporting our conclusion of a crosstalk between the 2 small GTPases . The defect in secretion of the Rap1B (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets is less severe than that observed in platelets deficient in CalDAG - GEFI and P2Y12 . To us the most likely explanation for this difference is provided by back - up signaling in Rap1B (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets via Rap2 , which was shown to associate with granules in human neutrophils . 43 Confirming this hypothesis , we here provide first evidence that CalDAG - GEFI mediates Rap2 activation in Cvx - acti - vated platelets and that simultaneous deficiency of CalDAG - GEFI and P2Y12 prevents the generation of Rap2 - GTP ( Supplemental Figure II ) . Recent studies in transgenic mice identified a key role for Rac1 in various platelet responses . 11 – 13 , 16 In our study we blocked Rac1 activation with EHT 1864 , an inhibitor that directly binds Rac , displaces the nucleotide and inhibits further GTP loading . 35 Thus , EHT 1864 inhibits Rac activa - Figure 5 . Rac1 signaling provides feedback for Rap1 and integrin activation in GPVI - stimulated platelets .

Stefanini et al Small GTPase Crosstalk in Platelets 439 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 10 , 2017 h tt p : / / a t vb . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m tion independent of which Rac - GEF catalyzes the GDP - GTP exchange , a clear advantage over other Rac inhibitors that target the function of individual Rac - GEFs . 44 Characteriza - tion studies in vitro and in cell types other than platelets have shown that EHT 1864 specifically inhibits all known Rac isoforms ( Rac1 (cid:9) Rac2 (cid:9)(cid:9) Rac3 ) , but not other Rho GTPases such as Cdc42 and RhoA . 35 In platelets stimulated via ITAM - coupled receptors , EHT 1864 completely prevents the activation of Rac1 , 17 the only Rac isoform expressed at detectable levels in these cells . 11 Moreover , WT platelets treated with EHT 1864 and platelets isolated from Rac1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice 11 – 13 , 16 show very similar defects in the platelet activation response , suggesting that neither RhoA nor Cdc42 - activation are affected by this compound . Using EHT 1864 - treated WT plate - lets as a control for impaired Rac1 signaling , we here provide the first evidence for Rap1 - dependent and - independent pools of Rac1 in platelets ( Figure 4C ) . Although the Rap1 - independent pool of Rac1 is critical for Ca 2 (cid:1) mobilization in platelets , Rap1 - dependent Rac1 signaling controls spreading , clot retraction , and granule release . Rac1 activation indepen - dent of Rap1 is consistent with studies in lymphocytes , where the Rac - GEF Vav is activated directly by tyrosine kinases and mediates Rac - dependent PLC (cid:1) activation downstream of ITAM - coupled receptors . 45 In platelets , the Vav1 and Vav3 isoforms have been implicated in GPVI - dependent PLC (cid:1) 2 activation . 46 It is currently not clear how Rap1 controls Rac1 in platelets or other cells , but it has been reported that GTP - bound Rap1 can bind to at least 3 distinct Rho - family GEFs . Studies in fibroblasts showed that Rap1 directly binds the RacGEFs Vav2 and Tiam1 , and that Rap1 is important for the translocation of the Rac - GEFs to the plasma membrane but not the GTP - loading of Rac1 . 47 However , a more recent study in T cells demonstrates that constitutively active Rap1 directly binds Tiam1 and enhances Rac1 GTP - loading . 48 A separate study further identified that binding of Rap1 - GTP to STEF ( Tiam2 ) is necessary for STEF - dependent Rac1 acti - vation in Chinese hamster ovary cells . 49 Our studies show markedly impaired Rac GTP - loading in DKO platelets , sug - gesting that GEF - mediated activation of the small GTPase rather than the translocation of the GEFs may be responsible for the observed crosstalk in platelets . It is also conceivable that active Rap inhibits a Rac - GTPase - activating proteins , which would lead to sustained Rac activity . To the best of our knowledge , however , such an interaction has not been docu - mented . Furthermore , our results do not exclude the possibil - ity that Rap affects Rac indirectly via a different signaling pathway that feeds into Rac1 activation . Although the spreading defect in DKO and WT / EHT platelets was very similar , we observed interesting differ - ences in granule release and calcium mobilization in these cells . The release of both (cid:2) - and dense - granules was virtually abolished in DKO platelets , whereas significant granule release was observed in WT / EHT cells stimulated with high - dose Cvx ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , Cvx - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) mobilization from internal stores was reduced in WT / EHT but not DKO platelets ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . It is difficult to speculate why granule release in the absence of Rap1 signal - ing is completely abolished , whereas inhibition of Rac1 or genetic deletion of Rac1 16 only partially blocks this response . One possibility is that integrin outside - in signaling provides important feedback for granule release , and that this process is more profoundly affected in DKO platelets . Supporting this hypothesis , we observed a stronger contribution of Rap1 to clot retraction ( Figure 2C and 2D ) , a cellular response dependent on integrin outside - in signaling . 50 Alternatively , Rap could be directly involved in granule release as it has been suggested based on its enrichment in granule mem - branes . 18 , 43 Further studies are required to address this point . In conclusion , we show that Rap1 - Rac1 circuits potentiate platelet activation downstream of the collagen receptor , GPVI . While signaling via Rac1 affects both the early and the late phase of Rap1 activation , active Rap1 is required for sustained but not immediate activation of Rac1 .

Platelets were stimulated in non - stirring conditions with increasing doses of convulxin . The reaction was stopped after 10 minutes with 0 . 1M EDTA / 4 % formaldehyde solution . The samples were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10 , 000 g and the supernatants were used for scintillation counting of 3 H - serotonin . Total or 100 % dense granule secretion was defined as the 3 H - serotonin in samples lysed with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . 5 Aggregometry Washed platelets were re - suspended at a concentration of 3 x 10 8 platelets / ml in modified Tyrode’s Buffer containing 0 . 35 % BSA and 1 mM CaCl 2 . The experiment was performed at 37°C in the presence of 50 µ g / ml fibrinogen and under stirring conditions ( 1200 rpm ) . Increasing concentrations of convulxin were added and light transmission was recorded over 5 minutes on a Chrono - log 4 - channel optical aggregation system ( Chrono - log , Havertown , PA ) . 6 Figure Legends Supplemental Figure I .
