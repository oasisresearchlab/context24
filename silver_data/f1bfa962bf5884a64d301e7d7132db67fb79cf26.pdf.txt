The Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent stimulation of neurite elongation has generally been assumed to be mediated by CaM - kinase II ( CaMKII ) , although othermembersoftheCaMKfamilyarehighlyexpressedindevelopingneurons . Wehaveexaminedthisassumptionusingacombination ofdominant – negativeCaMKs ( dnCaMKs ) andotherspecificCaMKinhibitors . HerewereportthatinhibitionofcytosolicCaMKI , butnot CaMKII or nuclear CaMKIV , dramatically decreases axonal outgrowth and branching in cultured neonatal hippocampal and postnatal cerebellar granule neurons . CaMKI is found throughout the cell cytosol , including the growth cone . Growth cones of neurons expressing dnCaMI or dnCaMKK , the upstream activator of CaMKI , exhibit collapsed morphology with a prominent reduction in lamellipodia . Live - cellimagingconfirmsthatthesemorphologicalchangesareassociatedwithadramaticdecreaseingrowthconemotility . Treatment of neurons with 1 , 8 - naphthoylene benzimidazole - 3 - carboxylic acid ( STO - 609 ) , an inhibitor of CaMKK , causes a similar change in mor - phology and reduction in growth cone motility , and this inhibition can be rescued by transfection with an STO - 609 - insensitive mutant of CaMKKorbytransfectionwithconstitutivelyactiveCaMKI . TheseresultsidentifyCaMKIasapositivetransducerofgrowthconemotility and axon outgrowth and provide a new physiological role for the CaMKK – CaMKI pathway . Key words : calcium ; Ca ; calmodulin ; growth cone ; hippocampus ; kinase ; neurite Introduction Neurite extension and growth cone dynamics show complex re - sponses that depend on the localization , concentration , and tem - poral dynamics of the Ca 2 (cid:1) signal ( Kater and Mills , 1991 ; Pe - tersen and Cancela , 2000 ) . Many stimulatory effects of Ca 2 (cid:1) on neurite outgrowth are blocked by the compound 1 - [ N , O - bis ( 5 - isoquinolinesulfonyl ) - N - methyl - L - tyrosyl ] - 4 - phenylpiperazine ( KN - 62 ) ( Zheng et al . , 1994 ; Solem et al . , 1995 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ; Kuhn et al . , 1998 ; Vaillant et al . , 2002 ) . Because KN - 62 was originally thought to be a specific calmodulin kinase II ( CaMKII ) inhibitor ( Tokumitsu et al . , 1990 ) , it was assumed that CaMKII mediated these stimulatory Ca 2 (cid:1) effects ; however , KN - 62 is now recognizedtoalsoinhibitCaMKIVandCaMKI ( Mochizukietal . , 1993 ; Enslen et al . , 1994 ) . Furthermore , the effects of CaMKII expressiononneuriteoutgrowthareunclear . Expressionofactive CaMKII enhances neurite extension in neuroblastoma cells ( Goshima et al . , 1993 ; Sogawa et al . , 2000 ) but suppresses it in PC12 cells ( Tashima et al . , 1996 ) and Xenopus retinotectal neu - rons ( Wu and Cline , 1998 ) . Recent work indicates that (cid:1) , but not (cid:2) , CaMKII can have stimulatory effects on dendritic arborization ( Fink et al . , 2003 ) . Hence , it is important to reexamine the ques - tion of which CaMKs are involved in regulating axonal extension and growth cone motility to elucidate the relevant signaling pathways . Other CaMKs abundant in neurons include members of the CaMK cascade : CaMKI , CaMKIV , and CaMKK ( for review , see Soderling , 1999 ; Means , 2000 ) . CaMKK , which is present in both the cytoplasm ( (cid:2) isoform ) and nucleus ( (cid:1) isoform ) ( Sakagami et al . , 2000 ; Nakamura et al . , 2001 ) , phosphorylates and activates CaMKI and CaMKIV in response to elevations of intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) . CaMKK is present in neurons in most brain regions , but its developmental pattern of expression is not known . CaMKIV is restricted primarily to the nucleus ( Jensen et al . , 1991 ) , where it phosphorylates several transcription factors such as cAMP re - sponse element - binding protein ( CREB ) and its coactivator CREB binding protein ( Impey et al . , 2002 ) . Various isoforms of CaMKIV ( Sakagami et al . , 1992 ) exhibit high expression throughout development in hippocampal pyramidal and cere - bellar granule neurons . In neurons , CaMKI is predominantly cytoplasmic ( Picciotto et al . , 1995 ) ; however , a splice variant of the (cid:1) isoform is nuclear ( Rina et al . , 2001 ) , and the (cid:3) isoform can be associated with the Golgi and plasma membranes ( Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2003 ) .

CaMKI is present in numerous brain regions , including hippocampal pyramidal and cerebellar granule neu - rons , cell types that are examined in this report . Although several in vitro substrates for CaMKI are known ( Nairn and Greengard , 1987 ; Picciotto et al . , 1992 ; Lee et al . , 1994 ) , in vivo substrates are unknown , and therefore physiological roles for CaMKI have been essentially unexplored . Using a combination of dominant – negative ( dn ) kinases and other specific kinase inhibitors , we find that CaMKI regulates axonal extension and growth cone motility in cultured hip - pocampal and cerebellar nerve cells . These results show that CaMKI plays a previously unsuspected role in the regulation of actin - based motility in developing neurons . Materials and Methods Cellculture . High - densityhippocampalneurons ( 2 (cid:2) 10 5 cellspersquare centimeter ) were cultured according to the procedure of Brewer ( 1997 ) from P0 – 2 Sprague Dawley rats on plates coated with poly - D - lysine ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ; molecular weight (cid:3) 300 , 000 ) . The hippocampal neurons were maintained in Neurobasal A media ( Invitrogen , Gaithers - burg , MD ) supplementedwithB27 ( Invitrogen ) and0 . 5m ML - glutamine with 5 (cid:4) M cytosine (cid:1) - D - arabinofuranoside ( AraC ) added at day 2 in vitro ( 2 DIV ) . Low - density hippocampal neuronal cell cultures ( (cid:4) 10 4 neu - rons per square centimeter ) were prepared from E18 rats as described previously ( Goslin and Banker , 1998 ) . Cerebellar granule cell cultures werepreparedfromP6 – 8SpragueDawleyratsusingpapaindissociation ( Worthington Biochemical , Freehold , NJ ) . The cerebellar granule cells were plated ( 2 – 4 (cid:2) 10 5 cells per square centimeter ) on borosilicate glass coverslips coated with poly D - lysine and grown in Neurobasal A media supplemented with 2 (cid:2) B27 , 4 % FBS , 0 . 5 m M L - glutamine , 25 m M KCl , and 5 (cid:4) M AraC . None of the CaMK transfections or 1 , 8 - naphthoylene benzimidazole - 3 - carboxylic acid ( STO - 609 ) treatment described in this work had noticeable effects on apoptosis as assessed by condensed nuclei using Hoechst staining . Vector constructs . All of the CaMK constructs used in this study were the (cid:2) isoforms . The expression vectors for dnCaMKK and dnAkt ( Yano et al . , 1998 ) , dnCaMKIV ( Gringhuis et al . , 1997 ) , and CaMKIIN ( Chang et al . , 2001 ) have been described previously . The dnCaMKI was gener - ated by a series of point mutations : K49E , T177A , 286IHQS to 286EDDD , and 307F to A . The K49 ( catalytic lysine ) to E mutation disrupts catalytic activity . The T177 ( activation loop threonine ) to A mutation prevents CaMKK phosphorylation of the activation loop of CaMKI . Mutations 286IHQS to EDDD and 307F to A ( Matsushita and Nairn , 1998 ) disrupt the autoinhibitory domain , thereby mimicking the effect of Ca 2 (cid:1) – CaM - binding . The constitutively active CaMKI ( ca - CaMKI ) mutant was identical to dnCaMKI but without the K49E and T177A mutations . The enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) - tagged wild - type ( wt ) CaMKI , dnCaMKI , and wtCaMKK were constructed using the plasmid EGFP ( pEGFP ) vector ( Clontech , Cambridge , UK ) . Nuclear - restricted dnCaMKIV ( dnCaMKIVnuc ) was constructed using the pEGF - Pnuc vector ( Clontech ) . Transfections . Primary hippocampal neurons and cerebellar granule neurons were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 ( Invitrogen ) ac - cording to the manufacturer’s protocols . In each culture type , we opti - mized DNA amounts , transfection reagent amounts , and transfection durations to yield minimal toxicity and maximal transfection efficiency . Microscopy and quantification of neurite outgrowth and growth cone motility . After transfection , cells were allowed to grow for varying times ( 8 hr to 2 d ) , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , 4 % sucrose , 50 m M HEPES , PBS , pH 7 . 5 , for 10 – 15 min at room temperature , and then permeabilized with 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS . Filamentous actin was visualized using Texas Red - labeled phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Indirect immu - nofluorescence with anti - tubulin antibody ( Ab ) clone 6 – 11B - 1 ( Sigma ) was used to visualize microtubules . Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axio - phot or a Leica DM RXA microscope using high numerical aperture lenses , and the images were recorded with a cooled CCD camera . Total process lengths were measured using MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging , West Chester , PA ) . Axonal and dendritic processes were iden - tified by their morphological characteristics ( Goslin and Banker , 1998 ) . High - resolution confocal images were acquired using an Olympus Fluo - View FV300 confocal laser scanning microscope . For live imaging , cells were maintained in a sealed , heated chamber ( Warner Instruments ) in balanced salt solution supplemented with 0 . 6 % glucose . Care was taken to attenuate excitation light and shutter light exposure to prevent growth cone collapse caused by phototoxicity . Images were captured every 5 sec over a time period of 10 min . For analysis of motility , outlines of growth cones drawn on individual frames were overlaid in Adobe Photoshop , and the area occupied by the growth cone in all frames ( black ) was contrasted with the area visited by the growth cone in only some of the frames ( depicted in white ) . Results CaMKII does not stimulate axon outgrowth To identify the CaMKs that mediate the effects of Ca 2 (cid:1) on axon development , we focused on two well characterized cell culture models , neonatal hippocampal neurons grown under standard conditions and postnatal cerebellar neurons grown in slightly depolarizing conditions , that are routinely used to prevent apo - ptosis . We first explored the possible involvement of CaMKII , a multifunctional kinase known to regulate several neuronal func - tions ( for review , see Soderling et al . , 2001 ; Lisman et al . , 2002 ) , because it had been implicated in previous studies ( Zheng et al . , 1994 ; Solem et al . , 1995 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ; Kuhn et al . , 1998 ; Vaillant et al . , 2002 ) . Rather than using KN - 62 , which inhibits various CaMK family members , we overexpressed CaMKIIN , an endogenous protein inhibitor of CaMKII ( Chang et al . , 1998 , 2001 ) . CaMKIIN inhibits both the (cid:2) and (cid:1) brain isoforms of CaMKII ( IC 50 (cid:4) 50 n M ) , whereas concentrations up to 10 (cid:4) M show little inhibition of CaMKK , CaMKI , CaMKIV , protein ki - nase A ( PKA ) , or PKC . CaMKIIN inhibits the CaM - dependent activity of CaMKII and , unlike KN - 62 , also blocks constitutive CaMKII activity because of its activation through autophosphor - ylation of Thr286 . To determine whether overexpression of CaMKIIN alters axon outgrowth , we transfected hippocampal or cerebellar gran - ule neurons on day 2 in culture with CaMKIIN and EGFP ( to label transfected cells ) or with EGFP alone as a control . Cultures were fixed on day 4 , and neurite length and branching were ana - lyzed in fluorescent cells . At this stage of development both axons and immature dendrites are growing rapidly , with the axon ac - counting for (cid:4) 85 % of total neurite length . Overexpression of CaMKIIN effectively blocked KCl - induced activation of CaMKII ( i . e . , its autophosphorylation on Thr286 ) , but did not reduce total neurite length , the average number of neurites projecting from the cell body , or the number of neurite terminals , a measure of neurite branching ( Fig . 1 ) . In fact , CaMKIIN had a slight stim - ulatory effect in cerebellar granule neurons ( numbers of pro - cesses and terminals ) , suggesting that CaMKII may be inhibitory . CaMKK and CaMKI stimulate axon extension Because these data indicate that CaMKII does not play a stimu - latory role in axon extension in hippocampal or cerebellar neu - rons , we next investigated other members of the CaMK family using “kinase dead” dominant – negative constructs . Neurons ( 2 DIV ) were transfected with vectors expressing dnCaMKs ( see Materials and Methods for details of constructs ) fused to EGFP , cultured for an additional 2 d , and fixed , and fluorescent cells were analyzed . Hippocampal neurons expressing EGFP alone had the typical morphology of young , stage 4 cells ( Dotti et al . , Waymanetal . • CaM - KinaseIRegulatesAxonalGrowthCones J . Neurosci . , April14 , 2004 • 24 ( 15 ) : 3786 – 3794 • 3787 1988 ) , with one long branched axon and several shorter dendrites ( Fig . 2 A , Control ) . Total neurite length averaged 3000 (cid:4) m ( Fig . 2 B ) . Expression of dnCaMKI , dnCaMKIV , or dnCaMKK sup - pressed neurite length by (cid:4) 70 % and also significantly reduced the numbers of primary processes and termini per cell ( Fig . 2 A – C ) . A similar dramatic inhibition of neurite extension , number of primary processes , and number of termini was observed in cere - bellar granule neurons expressing these dominant – negative con - structs ( Fig . 3 ) . Growth of both axons and immature dendrites was inhibited in both cell types . It is expected that dnCaMKK would have effects similar to dnCaMKI or dnCaMKIV because CaMKK is the upstream acti - vator for both of these kinases . The dnCaMKI and dnCaMKIV probably act by sequestering the upstream CaMKK . If so , expres - sion of dnCaMKI should block CaMKK - mediated phosphoryla - tion of Thr177 in endogenous CaMKI . Using a phospho - specific Ab to phospho - Thr177 in CaMKI ( supplemental Fig . S1 A , avail - able at www . jneurosci . org ) , we show that transfection of NG108 neuroblastoma cells with dnCaMKI strongly suppresses activa - tionofendogenousCaMKI ( supplementalFig . S1 B ) . NG108cells were used because the transfection efficiency is (cid:4) 80 % compared with 1 – 3 % efficiency in hippocampal neurons . However , it was surprising that dnCaMKIV was also inhibitory to neurite out - growth ( Fig . 2 ) , because the subcellular distributions of CaMKI and CaMKIV are very different in neurons . It is well established that CaMKIV is mostly nuclear ( Jensen et al . , 1991 ) , whereas CaMKI is predominantly cytoplasmic ( Picciotto et al . , 1995 ) . Im - munostainingofculturedhippocampalneuronsconfirmedthaten - dogenous CaMKI was cytosolic , including expression throughout the axonal and dendritic arbors ( Fig . 4 A ) . Because overexpressed proteins can exhibit anomalous subcellular distribution , we exam - ined this issue . As expected , the (cid:2) isoforms of EGFP - tagged wt - CaMKI ( Fig . 4 B ) and wtCaMKK ( Fig . 4 C ) , as well as EGFP - tagged dnCaMKI and dnCaMKK ( data not shown ) , were present in the cytoplasmoftransfectedneuronsandwereessentiallyexcludedfrom the nucleus . In contrast , expressed EGFP - tagged dnCaMKIV was not restricted to the nucleus but showed strong cytoplasmic expres - sion that extended out into the dendrites and axon ( supplemental Fig S1 A , top panels ) . To direct localization of dnCaMKIV to the samesubcellularlocaleasendogenousCaMKIV , weaddedanuclear localization signal ( nuc ) to EGFP - dnCaMKIV . As predicted , EGFP - tagged dnCaMKIVnuc was restricted to the nucleus ( supplemental Fig S1 A , bottom panels ) . Unlike mislocalized dnCaMKIV , dnCaMKIVnuc had little effect on neurite growth and branching in either hippocampal ( Fig . 2 ) or cerebellar ( Fig . 3 ) neurons , but it was highly effective at blocking CREB - dependent gene transcription ( supplemental Fig . S1 B ) . These results demonstrate that the nuclear effectsofdnCaMKIVarenotinvolvedinregulatingaxonoutgrowthatthisstageofdevelopmentandthattheobservedinhibitoryeffectofdnCaMKIVwascausedbyitsabnormalcytosoliclocalization . Because the activation site Ser308 in the protein kinase Akt – protein kinase B PKB is also a substrate for CaMKK ( Yano et al . , 1998 ) , albeit relatively poor compared with CaMKI or CaMKIV , we also determined the effects of dnAkt . Transfected EGFP - dnAkt had no significant effect on total neurite length ( supple - mental Fig . S2 ) . We have previously used this dnAkt to inhibit Akt in NG108 cells ( Yano et al . , 1998 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that CaMKK and CaMKI , but not Akt or nuclear CaMKIV , regulate axon extension under our conditions . Role for CaMKI in growth cones We were especially interested in the role of CaMKs in the growth cone , which functions both as a sensor of chemical cues ( e . g . , Ca 2 (cid:1) signaling ) and as a mechanical transducer ( via actin reor - ganization ) to promote axon outgrowth ( Gomez and Spitzer , 2000 ) . CaMKI , localized with two separate antibodies , extended throughout the neurites and was present in axonal growth cones ( Fig . 4 A ) . To further explore the subcellular localization of these kinases , we analyzed the distribution of EGFP - tagged kinases in cultures of hippocampal neurons prepared at low density so that the morphology of individual neurons could be visualized more easily . Wild - type EGFP - tagged CaMKK and CaMKI were present throughout the axon and dendrites , extending into the axonal growth cone ( Fig . 4 B , C ) . Similar results were obtained with myc - tagged CaMKK and CaMKI ( data not shown ) , excluding the ef - fects of the EGFP tag on localization of these kinases . Because CaMKK and its downstream substrate CaMKI are present in axonal growth cones , we examined the effects of inhibiting CaMKI on growth cone morphology . Low - density Figure1 .

Axonal growth cones of neurons express - ing dnCaMKI were dramatically different from those of cells expressing EGFP alone or EGFP - wtCaMKI ( Fig . 5 ) . Their growth cones appeared “collapsed , ” with reduced lamellipodial area and a strong reduction in the number of filopodia ( Fig . 5 , middle panel , left side ) . Microtubules in the axon shafts appeared essentially unaffected by dnCaMKI . These data suggest that CaMKK and CaMKI may support axon extension by regulating the growth cone cytoskeleton . CaMKI regulates growth cone motility To examine the role of the CaMKK – CaMKI pathway on axonal growth cone dynamics , low - density hippocampal cul - tures were transfected with either EGFP , EGFP - wtCaMKI , orEGFP - dnCaMKI , and remodeling of growth cones was followed by live - cell imaging . Images of EGFP fluo - rescence were obtained at 5 sec intervals for a period of 10 min . Movies illustrating growth cone movements are provided as supplemental material ( available at www . jneurosci . org ) , and selected frames from these movies are shown in Figure 6 . Con - trol neurons exhibited prominent lamelli - podial activity ( extension and retraction of veils between filopodia ) as well as filopo - dial motility ( supplemental movie 1 ) ( Fig . 6 A ) . In the peripheral region of the growth cone , acontinuous , rearwardflowoffluores - cence was seen , probably corresponding to the retrograde flow of actin and plasma membrane observed by others ( Lin and Forscher , 1995 ) . Expression of wtCaMKI slightly enhanced growth cone size and mo - tility ( Figs . 5 , 6 B ) ( supplemental movie 2 ) . Incontrast , expressionofdnCaMKImark - edly reduced axonal growth cone motility ( supplemental movies 3 and 4 ) ( Fig . 6 C ) . Lamellipodial extension was blocked , and the rearward flow of fluorescence was in - hibited . The number of filopodia was greatly reduced , and the few filopodia that remained were frozen . At 8 hr after trans - fection of dnCaMKI , motility was blocked in some cells and reduced in others ( Fig . 6 C , top panel ) ( supplemental movie 3 ) . By 20 – 24 hr , motility was effectively blocked in all transfected cells ( Fig . 6 C , bottom panel ) ( supplemental movie 4 ) . Images summarizing the extent of motility ob - served over a 5 min period are shown in Figure 6 ( right panels ) . As these images and time - lapse recordings clearly illus - trate , expression of EGFP - dnCaMKI greatly reduced the overall size of axonal Figure 2 .

Despite these pronounced changed in actin - based motility , axonal transport of phase - dense organelles ap - peared to be normal ( data not shown ) . It appears that the major effect of dnCaMKI may be on the lamellipodia . The CaMKK inhibitor STO - 609 phenocopies dnCaMKK and dnCaMKI To confirm the effects of dnCaMKI or dnCaMKK using an independent ap - proach , we turned to a selective , cell - permeable CaMKK inhibitor , STO - 609 ( Tokumitsu et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . This inhib - itor has an in vitro IC 50 of (cid:4) 0 . 26 (cid:4) M ( 0 . 1 (cid:4) g / ml ) for CaMKK . A 100 - fold higher concentration ( 26 (cid:4) M ) inhibitsCaMKIIby only 50 % , with essentially no effects on CaMKI , CaMKIV , PKA , PKC , or Erk1 . We confirmed the specificity of STO - 609 with regard to CaMKK versus CaMKII in cul - tured hippocampal neurons as follows . In - cubation with 2 . 6 (cid:4) M STO - 609 blocked CaMKK , assessed by its activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV , but it did not in - hibit CaMKII ( supplemental Fig . S3 ) . STO - 609 treatment caused an (cid:4) 70 % re - duction in total neurite length ( Fig . 7 A ) , mimicking the effect of dnCaMKK in Fig - ure 2 . Importantly , the inhibitory effect of STO - 609 was rescued by transfection with a CaMKK mutant ( CaMKK L233F ) that has a 10 - to 80 - fold lower affinity for STO - 609 than wild - type CaMKK ( Tokumitsu et al . , 2003 ) . IfthedownstreamtargetofCaMKK is CaMKI , constitutively active CaMKI should also reverse the effects of STO - 609 , and this was observed ( Fig . 7 A ) . Moreover , intheabsenceofSTO - 609 , caCaMKIstim - ulated axon outgrowth . We also tested whether STO - 609 might inhibit Akt . Akt can be activated through phosphorylation of Ser308 and Ser473 by numerouskinases , includingCaMKK ( Yano et al . , 1998 ) . Under our culture conditions , phosphorylation of Ser308 , the site phos - phorylated by CaMKK , was barely detect - able compared with Ser473 ; neither was in - hibited by STO - 609 but both were blocked bythephosphoinositide ( PI ) 3 - kinaseinhib - itorwortmannin ( Fig . S3 ) . Weconcludethat thelow“basal”AktactivationinourneuronsiscausedbydownstreammembersofthePI3 - kinase pathway ( e . g . , PDK1 ) and not by CaMKK . Combined with the fact that dnAkt did not suppress axonal outgrowth ( Fig . S2 ) , Akt does not appear to mediate the effects of CaMKK on axonal outgrowth . Because STO - 609 mimicked the effects of dnCaMKK and dnCaMKI on axon elongation , we also examined its effects on growth cone morphology and motility . Incubation with 2 . 6 (cid:4) M STO - 609 caused axonal growth cone collapse that began at (cid:4) 1 hr and was maximal by 2 hr ( Fig . 7 B , C ) . This time course may be dictatedtoalargeextentbythelimitedcellpermeabilityofSTO - 609 , a water - soluble molecule . Treatment of cultured hippocampal neu - ronswith2 . 6 (cid:4) M STO - 609alsomimickedtheeffectofdnCaMKIon growth cone motility ( supplemental movie 5 ) . Motility of an indi - vidual growth cone was recorded for periods of 5 min at varying times ( 5 , 60 , and 90 min ) after STO - 609 treatment . Individual frames from such a movie are shown in Figure 7 D . After STO - 609 treatmentfor60or90min , therewasaprofounddecreaseingrowth cone motility .

Here we show that the CaMKK – CaMKI pathway is required for normal axon outgrowth and axonal growth cone morphology and motil - ity in cultured hippocampal ( stage 4 ) and cerebellar granule neu - rons . This conclusion is based on multiple experimental strate - gies : overexpression of a specific CaMKII inhibitor protein ( CaMKIIN ) , transfection with targeted dominant – negative ki - nase constructs , and treatment with the CaMKK inhibitor STO - 609 combined with rescue by an engineered inhibitor - insensitive mutant of CaMKK or by constitutively active CaMKI . These re - sults provide one of the first reports of a physiological role for CaMKI . In addition , our work demonstrates that CaMKII , which was previously thought to mediate stimulatory effects on neurite growth , does not play a major role in early axon extension . CaMKK signals through CaMKI Our results provide very compelling evidence that CaMKK acti - vation of CaMKI mediates axon outgrowth through regulation of its growth cone motility . Dominant – negative constructs of sig - naling proteins are commonly used to map out signaling path - ways ( Carpenter and Cantley , 1996 ) . The dnCaMKI and dnCaMKIV likely act by sequestering their upstream activator , CaMKK , rather than their downstream substrate ( s ) . For exam - ple , hippocampal slices from transgenic mice expressing dnCaMKIV show a suppressed Ca 2 (cid:1) - stimulated CREB phos - phorylation without any effect on CREB phosphorylation medi - ated by elevation of cAMP ( Kang et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , it is not surprising that overexpressed dominant – negative constructs of adjacent members in a signaling cascade ( CaMKI and CaMKK ) might yield similar effects on neurite development as we observed ( Fig . 2 ) . We further demonstrate the impor - tance of confirming the correct subcellular distribution of expressed constructs . Our transfected dnCaMKIV was incorrectly lo - calized to the cytoplasm where it sup - pressed neurite extension , probably by se - questering CaMKK , but when properly confined to the nucleus it had no effect . Finally , we confirmed the results obtained with the dominant – negative CaMKs using a pharmacological approach . The newly characterized CaMKK inhibitor STO - 609 ( Tokumitsu et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) mimicked the effects of dnCaMKK or dnCaMKI on axon extension , growth cone collapse ( Fig . 7 ) , and growth cone motility ( supplemen - tal movie 5 ) when used at a concentration ( 2 . 6 (cid:4) M ) that inhibits CaMKK but not CaMKII ( supplemental Fig . S3 ) . Most im - portantly , the inhibitory effect of STO - 609 on axon elongation was reversed by ex - pression of the drug - insensitive mutant of CaMKK or constitutively active CaMKI , the downstream target of CaMKK ( Fig . 7 ) . These results compel us to conclude that the CaMKK – CaMKI pathway is the in vivo target of STO - 609 in axon extension . The roles of CaMKII and CaMKIV in neurite development Previous studies concerning the role of CaMKII in neurite out - growth have yielded somewhat conflicting results , some suggest - ing that CaMKII activation stimulates neurite elongation , and others suggesting that it inhibits elongation ( see Introduction ) . Many of these studies relied on pharmacological manipulations using inhibitors such as KN - 62 , which subsequent studies have shown blocks several members of the CaMK family . In our ex - periments , inhibition of CaMKII by expression of CaMKIIN ( which does not inhibit CaMKI , CaMKIV , CaMKK , PKA , or PKC ) had little or no effect on neurite growth and branching in immature hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons ( Figs . 2 , 3 ) . Indeed , it has been reported that activation of CaMKII is relatively refractory in axons , compared with the soma or den - drites , at this stage of development ( Menegon et al . , 2002 ) , con - sistent with our conclusion that CaMKII is not important in reg - ulating axonal outgrowth early in development . Because the axon comprises most of the total neurite length in our experiments and the dendrites are immature , our conclusions are only compelling for the developing axon . It appears that CaMKII plays a more important role later in the development of dendrites . For exam - ple , Wu and Cline ( 1998 ) found that CaMKII inhibits dendritic develop in Xenopus neurons , consistent with a role in stabilizing dendritic arborization , but CaMKII had no effect on the rate of axon outgrowth , axon growth cone dynamics , or the initial for - mation of dendritic branches . A recent report shows that (cid:1) CaMKII , but not the (cid:2) isoform , enhances dendritic motility and arborization in hippocampal neurons ( Fink et al . , 2003 ) . Previ - ous studies had expressed the (cid:2) isoform , perhaps accounting for much of the previous confusion over the role of CaMKII . In this Figure6 .

Neurosci . , April14 , 2004 • 24 ( 15 ) : 3786 – 3794 • 3791 context , it is important to note that CaMKIIN , the inhibitor used in our exper - iments , effectively blocks both the (cid:2) and (cid:1) isoforms ( Chang et al . , 1998 ) . IthasbeenreportedthatCaMKIV , prob - ably acting through phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor CREB , is a mediator of depolarization - enhanced dendritic growth in cortical neurons ( Redmond et al . , 2002 ) . Constitutively active CaMKIV enhanced dendritic growth , whereas dnCaMKIV inhibited KCl - stimulated growth ; however , the sub - cellular localization of these CaMKIV con - structs was not determined , and overex - pressed constitutively active kinases can evoke nonphysiological responses caused by lack of their substrate specificity . In our experiments , dnCaMKIV was expressed predominantly in the cytosol ( supplemental Fig . S1 A , top panels ) where it did inhibit axon extension ( Figs . 2 , 3 ) , presumably by sequestering CaMKK . Consistent with this mechanism of sequestering CaMKK , dnCaMKI suppresses it own activation by CaMKK ( supplemental Fig . S1 B ) ; however , whenproperlytargetedtothenucleuswithanuclearlocalizationsignal ( supplemental Fig . S1 A , bottom panels ) , dnCaMKIV had no effect on axon extension , although it po - tentlyinhibitedCREB - dependentgenetran - scription ( Figs . 2 , 3 ) . Thus , we conclude that nuclearCaMKIVisnotregulatoryforaxonaloutgrowth . CaMKI and the regulation of growth cone motility Transient increases of Ca 2 (cid:1) that are spa - tially restricted within the growth cone can rapidly alter its morphology and motility , presumably by regulating actin dynamics ( Lau et al . , 1999 ; Zheng , 2000 ; Chadborn et al . , 2002 ; Cheng et al . , 2002 ; Meyer and Feldman , 2002 ) . Our results indicate that CaMKK via its downstream target CaMKI mediates these effects on axonal growth cone motility . CaMKI is present in axonal growth cones , and inhibitors of CaMKI or CaMKKinducegrowthconecollapse . This inhibition can be overcome by expression of constitutively active CaMKI . Our current results , combined with re - cent reports in the literature , extend an emerging theme of signaling specificity mediated by distinct CaMK family mem - bers during neuronal development and plasticity . That is , during development , CaMKI mediates axon extension ( this report ) , whereas dendritic arborization is regu - lated by (cid:1) CaMKII ( Fink et al . , 2003 ) . In synaptic plasticity , (cid:2) CaMKII enhances synaptic current by increasing single channel conductance of AMPA receptors ( Barria et al . , 1997 ; Derkach et al . , 1999 ; Lee et al . , 2000 ) , whereas (cid:1) CaMKII diminishes current ( Thiagarajan et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , identifying the relevant kinase mediating a physiological response is crucial in that it focuses attention on likely substrates for that kinase . Our study shifts the focus , in terms of axon elongation , away from CaMKII and nu - clear CaMKIV and toward CaMKI , particularly its substrates that might regulate growth cone actin dynamics . There are a large number of phosphoproteins in the growth cone that regulate actin polymerization – depolymerization that Figure7 .

Synapsin , the first identified in vitro CaMKI substrate ( Nairn and Greengard , 1987 ) , can regulate hippocampal neurite outgrowth in a PKA - dependent phosphor - ylation pathway ( Kao et al . , 2002 ) . Because PKA and CaMKI phosphorylate the same site in synapsin I ( Nairn and Greengard , 1987 ) , it may be the target for CaMKI . Alternatively , members of the Rho family of GTPases are known to be important regulators of actin filaments in filopodia and lamellipodia ( Dickson , 2001 ; Meyer and Feldman , 2002 ) , and some of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) that regulate Rho family GTPase activities can be modulated by phosphorylation . Examples include CaMKII - mediated phos - phorylation of Ras synaptic GAP ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) and the Rac GEF Tiam1 ( Fleming et al . , 1999 ) as well as PKA - dependent phosphorylation of the Ras GEF guanine nucleotide releasing factor ( Baouz et al . , 2001 ) . Because there is redundancy in the substrate specificities for the various CaMKs as well as for PKA , these GEFs and GAPs are potential targets of CaMKI . CaMKI can also phosphorylate myosin II regulatory light chain at the site ( Ser19 ) that stimulates Mg - ATPase activity of myosin II , thereby inducing reorganization of actin filaments ( Suizu et al . , 2002 ) . Our identification of CaMKI as a regulatory kinase in Ca 2 (cid:1) - mediated neurite outgrowth opens the way to identify the rele - vant substrates and elucidate the signaling pathways that it ini - tiates . For example , it will be important to determine whether phospho - mimetic constructs of putative CaMKI substrates ( e . g . , the Ser / Asp mutant of synapsin that mimics its phosphorylation ) ( Kao et al . , 2002 ) can rescue the inhibitory effects of dnCaMKI or STO - 609 . Our finding that we can inhibit CaMKK activation of CaMKI in neurons using a pharmacological approach opens the way for the biochemical identification of relevant substrates .
