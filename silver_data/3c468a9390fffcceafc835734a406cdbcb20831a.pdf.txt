These cellular processes are mediated by Ca 2 + - binding proteins , such as EF - hand superfamily proteins . Among the EF - hand superfamily proteins , allograft inﬂammatory factor - 1 ( AIF - 1 ) and swiprosin - 1 / EF - hand domain - containing protein 2 ( EFhd2 ) are cytosolic actin - binding proteins . AIF - 1 modulates the cytoskeleton and increases the migration of immune cells . EFhd2 is also a cytoskeletal protein implicated in immune cell activation and brain cell functions . EFhd1 , a mitochondrial fraternal twin of EFhd2 , mediates neuronal and pro - / pre - B cell differentiation and mitoﬂash activation . Although EFhd1 is important for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and energy synthesis , its mechanism of action remains unclear . Here , we report the crystal structure of the EFhd1 core domain comprising a C - terminus of a proline - rich region , two EF - hand domains , and a ligand mimic helix . Structural comparisons of EFhd1 , EFhd2 , and AIF - 1 revealed similarities in their overall structures . In the structure of the EFhd1 core domain , two Zn 2 + ions were observed at the interface of the crystal contact , suggesting the possibility of Zn 2 + - mediated multimerization . In addition , we found that EFhd1 has Ca 2 + - independent β - actin - binding and Ca 2 + - dependent β - actin - bundling activities . These ﬁndings suggest that EFhd1 , an actin - binding and - bundling protein in the mitochondria , may contribute to the Ca 2 + - dependent regulation of mitochondrial morphology and energy synthesis . Keywords : EFhd1 , swiprosin - 2 , crystal structure , β - actin , actin - binding protein , actin - bundling protein INTRODUCTION Regulation of the cytoskeleton is essential for cell dynamics , such as the maintenance of cell shape or motility ( Egelman , 2004 ; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Its malfunction promotes muscle weakness , cerebral arteriopathy , cardiomyopathy , and brain abnormalities ( Parker et al . , 2020 ) . As the major cytoskeletal protein is actin , its regulation is responsible for several cellular functions , Mun et al . Crystal Structure of EFhd1 / Swiprosin - 2 including maintenance of cellular morphology and formation of lamellipodia or ﬁlopodia ( Lee and Dominguez , 2010 ) . In the cytosol , actin monomers form actin ﬁlaments , and the actin ﬁlament networks are modulated by several actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , including proﬁlin and coﬁlin , which regulate the polymerization of actin and actinin , fascin , allograft inﬂammatory factor - 1 ( AIF - 1 ) , and EF - hand domain - containing protein 2 ( EFhd2 ) , which facilitate actin - bundling or cross - linking ( Dubernard et al . , 1997 ; Autieri et al . , 2003 ; Aratyn et al . , 2007 ; Lee and Dominguez , 2010 ; Kwon et al . , 2013 ; Ali et al . , 2016 ) . In the mitochondria , the maintenance of morphology and function requires the mitochondrial actin , β - actin ( Xie et al . , 2018 ) . β - actin knockout ( KO ) in mitochondria induces a severe loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , resulting in impaired mitochondrial DNA transcription and large aggregates of nucleoids ( Xie et al . , 2018 ) . The EF - hand domain - containing protein 1 ( EFhd1 ) , a homologous protein of EFhd2 , is localized in the mitochondria ( Tominaga et al . , 2006 ; Dutting et al . , 2011 ) . Since the gene encoding EFhd1 is not present in the mitochondrial DNA , following its translation in cytoplasm , EFhd1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria ( Anderson et al . , 1981 ) . EFhd2 , AIF - 1 , and EFhd1 have Ca 2 + - binding EF - hand motifs , which belong to the EF - hand superfamily , but they have distinct subcellular locations ( Dutting et al . , 2011 ) . For cytosolic EF - hand superfamily , EFhd2 was ﬁrst identiﬁed in lymphocytes , and it regulates cell spreading and the cell migration of immune and epithelial cells by F - actin rearrangement ( Vuadens et al . , 2004 ; Aratyn et al . , 2007 ; Ramesh et al . , 2009 ; Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . The crystal structure of Ca 2 + - bound state and EF - hand mutants of EFhd2 have been reported previously ( Park et al . , 2016 ) . The overall structures of EFhd2 are compact and rigid , comparable to those of Ca 2 + - calmodulin - peptide complexes ; however , EF - hand motifs are ﬂexible in the mutant structures . Since the rigidity of EF - hand motifs in EFhd2 is essential for the F - actin - bundling activity of EFhd2 , the mutants cannot bundle F - actin in vitro ( Park et al . , 2016 ; Durvanger and Harmat , 2019 ) . AIF - 1 is another cytosolic ABP that induces F - actin - bundling to control membrane ruﬄing in immune cells ( Sasaki et al . , 2001 ; Kanazawa et al . , 2002 ; Autieri et al . , 2003 ) . The crystal structure of AIF - 1 has a similar overall topology to that of EFhd2 ( Yamada et al . , 2006 ; Park et al . , 2016 ) . Unlike EFhd2 and AIF - 1 , EFhd1 is localized in the mitochondria and may regulate mitochondrial energy metabolism ( Tominaga et al . , 2006 ) . EFhd1 modulates the apoptosis and diﬀerentiation of neuronal and muscle cells ( Tominaga et al . , 2006 ; Dutting et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , EFhd1 induces not only mitoﬂashes but also metabolic changes during the development of pro - / pre - B cells ( Hou et al . , 2016 ; Stein et al . , 2017 ) . A recent report suggested that EFhd1 aﬀects mitochondrial morphology and energy production in the dorsal root ganglion neurons ( Ulisse et al . , 2020 ) . However , the mechanism underlying the regulation of how EFhd1 regulates several cellular functions is currently unclear . Here , we report the crystal structure of the core domain of mouse EFhd1 ( CD EFhd1 , residues 79 – 180 ) in a Ca 2 + - bound state , comprising a proline - rich ( PR ) region , two EF - hand motifs , a ligand mimic helix ( LM - helix ) , and a C - terminal linker . The overall structure of CD EFhd1 was similar to that of CD EFhd2 and AIF - 1 . Intriguingly , we found two Zn 2 + ions in the crystal packing interface , suggesting the plausible Zn 2 + - mediated multimerization . In addition , we identiﬁed Ca 2 + - independent α - and β - actin - binding and Ca 2 + - dependent β - actin - bundling activities of EFhd1 , indicating that EFhd1 might be involved in the Ca 2 + - dependent regulation of mitochondrial morphology via interactions with β - actin . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning , Expression , and Puriﬁcation of EFhd1 1 NTD ( Residues 69 – 240 ) The mouse EFhd1 1 NTD was ampliﬁed from full - length EFhd1 using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The ampliﬁed DNA was cloned into a modiﬁed pET - 28a vector ( Novagen ) that carried an N - terminal 6 × His ( His 6 ) - tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease cleavage site ( Glu - Asn - Leu - Tyr - Phe - Gln / Gly ) . The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) cells for protein expression . The cells were cultured at 37 ◦ C in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth containing 50 µ g / mL kanamycin until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0 . 7 . Recombinant protein expression was induced with isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) ( ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5 mM ) , and the cells were cultivated for an additional 4 h at 37 ◦ C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 , 000 × g for 15 min at 4 ◦ C . The harvested cell pellet was suspended in a lysis buﬀer [ 50 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 0 . 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) , and 14 . 3 mM β - mercaptoethanol ] . The resuspended cells were disrupted via sonication and centrifuged at 14 , 000 × g for 50 min at 4 ◦ C to discard cell debris . The soluble supernatant was loaded onto a gravity - ﬂow column ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) packed with Ni - IDA agarose resin ( Elpis ) , pre - equilibrated , and subsequently washed with the lysis buﬀer to remove any non - speciﬁc proteins . The desired protein was eluted with lysis buﬀer supplemented with 400 mM imidazole . After concentrating the eluate , the protein solution was incubated with TEV protease overnight at 4 ◦ C to cleave the N - terminal His 6 - TEV tag . To exchange the buﬀer for crystallization , the ﬁnal puriﬁed protein was passed through a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 75 gel - ﬁltration column ( Pharmacia Biotech ) pre - equilibrated with the ﬁnal buﬀer ( 20 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 4 mM PMSF , and 14 . 3 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) . The puriﬁed protein was concentrated using a 10 K centrifugal ﬁlter ( Millipore ) and stored at − 80 ◦ C . During puriﬁcation , the presence of EFhd1 protein was conﬁrmed via sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) , and protein degradation was observed following incubation with TEV protease . Cloning , Expression , and Puriﬁcation of Full - Length EFhd1 and EFhd2 To investigate the actin - binding function , we puriﬁed full - length EFhd1 and EFhd2 . Full - length EFhd1 was ampliﬁed using PCR and cloned into the modiﬁed pET - 28a vector ( Novagen ) carrying Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 January 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 628222 Mun et al . Crystal Structure of EFhd1 / Swiprosin - 2 an N - terminal His 6 - TEV tag . The overall expression and aﬃnity chromatography procedure of full - length EFhd1 was similar to that of EFhd1 1 NTD , except for the step involving the incubation of TEV protease . The process for the removal of the N - terminal His 6 - TEV tag was omitted due to protein degradation . After aﬃnity chromatography , the eluted protein was concentrated . The ﬁnal puriﬁed protein was passed through a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 75 gel - ﬁltration column pre - equilibrated with the ﬁnal buﬀer ( 20 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 8 mM PMSF , and 5 mM DTT ) . The puriﬁed protein was concentrated using 10 K centrifugal ﬁlters ( Millipore ) and stored at − 80 ◦ C . Full - length EFhd2 was ampliﬁed using PCR and cloned into the modiﬁed pET - 28a vector carrying an N - terminal His 6 tag . The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) cells to express the protein . The cells were grown at 37 ◦ C in LB broth containing 50 µ g / mL kanamycin until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0 . 7 . The recombinant protein was induced with 0 . 5 mM IPTG and the cells were cultured for an additional 5 h at 37 ◦ C . Cells were harvested via centrifugation at 4 , 000 × g for 15 min at 4 ◦ C , and the harvested cell pellet was suspended in a lysis buﬀer ( 50 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM imidazole , 0 . 4 mM PMSF , and 14 . 3 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) . The resuspended cells were disrupted via sonication and centrifuged at 14 , 000 × g for 50 min at 4 ◦ C to remove cell debris . The soluble supernatant was loaded onto a gravity - ﬂow column packed with Ni - IDA agarose resin previously equilibrated and subsequently washed with the lysis buﬀer to remove any non - speciﬁc proteins . The protein was eluted with lysis buﬀer supplemented with 400 mM imidazole . After concentrating the eluate , the ﬁnal puriﬁed protein was passed through a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 75 gel - ﬁltration column pre - equilibrated with the ﬁnal buﬀer ( 20 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 8 mM PMSF , and 5 mM DTT ) . The puriﬁed protein was concentrated using 10 K centrifugal ﬁlters ( Millipore ) and stored at − 80 ◦ C . Crystallization of EFhd1 Core Domain ( Residues 79 – 180 ) Initially , we attempted to crystallize Ca 2 + - bound EFhd1 1 NTD ( residues 69 – 240 ) . EFhd1 1 NTD was incubated for at least 20 min on ice after the addition of 1 mM CaCl 2 and then screened using the sitting - drop vapor - diﬀusion method in a 96 - well INTELLI - PLATE ( Art Robbins Ins . ) . We found that EFhd1 1 NTD was degraded and the core domain ( CD EFhd1 , residues 79 – 180 ) was crystallized . CD EFhd1 formed rod - shaped crystals after 1 week in a reservoir solution containing 80 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2 mM ZnSO 4 , and 25 % ( v / v ) Jeﬀamine ED - 2003 ( Molecular Dimensions ) . Additional reﬁnements of crystallization conditions were performed using the sitting - drop vapor - diﬀusion method , and drops were prepared by mixing 1 µ L of protein and 1 µ L of reservoir solution . Crystals were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 0 . 1 M HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 5 mM ZnSO 4 , and 25 % ( w / v ) Jeﬀamine ED - 2001 ( Hampton Research ) . For data collection , CD EFhd1 crystals were cryoprotected by transferring into a mother liquor containing additional 30 % ( v / v ) glycerol and ﬂash freezing in liquid nitrogen . X - ray Data Collection , Structure Determination , and Reﬁnement X - ray diﬀraction data of CD EFhd1 were collected at 100 K using synchrotron X - ray sources on beamline 5C at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory ( PAL , South Korea ) . We collected the best resolution diﬀraction data for CD EFhd1 at a 2 . 07 Å resolution . The CD EFhd1 crystal belongs to the space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 with cell dimensions of a = 31 . 8 , b = 47 . 6 , and c = 87 . 2 Å . The diﬀraction data were indexed , processed , and scaled using the HKL2000 suite ( Otwinowski and Minor , 1997 ) . Template for molecular replacement ( MR ) of the EFhd1 core domain was generated by the SWISS - MODEL homology - modeling server using the human EFhd2 core domain ( PDB ID : 5I2L ) as the template ( Waterhouse et al . , 2018 ) . Using this homology - model , the initial model of EFhd1 was determined via MR using Phaser in CCP4 ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ; Winn et al . , 2011 ) . Using the initial model , additional model building was performed using the COOT program ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) . Iterative reﬁnement was performed with phenix . reﬁne ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ; Liebschner et al . , 2019 ) . The details of the data collection and reﬁnement statistics are provided in Table 1 . Structural Analysis All structural ﬁgures were generated using PyMOL version 1 . 5 . 0 . 4 ( Schrödinger LLC ) . PDBePISA was used to analyze the interface , and the PRODIGY web server was used to predict the binding energies of symmetry - mate molecules ( Krissinel and Henrick , 2007 ; Xue et al . , 2016 ) . Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ESPript 3 . 0 ( Robert and Gouet , 2014 ) . The F obs - F calc map was calculated using phenix . maps and converted to the ccp4 format using a phenix . mtz2map ( Liebschner et al . , 2019 ) . Zn 2 + - Dependent Precipitation Assay To measure the precipitation of EFhd1 and EFhd2 in various Zn 2 + concentrations , we performed an in vitro precipitation assay . First , 6 µ M of His 6 - TEV tagged full - length EFhd1 and His 6 tagged full - length EFhd2 were incubated with 20 µ M to 10 mM ZnCl 2 in reaction buﬀer ( 100 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) at 24 ◦ C for 30 min . The precipitated proteins were pelleted via centrifugation at 15 , 000 × g for 10 min at 24 ◦ C . Equal volumes of pellet or supernatant solutions were resolved via SDS - PAGE , and the protein bands were visualized via Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining . To measure the K agg 1 / 2 value ( concentration of half maximal protein aggregation for Zn 2 + ) , we used a spectrophotometric method . First , 6 µ M of His 6 - TEV tagged full - length EFhd1 and His 6 tagged full - length EFhd2 were incubated with various concentrations of ZnCl 2 ( 0 – 1 mM ZnCl 2 with EFhd1 , 0 – 20 mM ZnCl 2 with EFhd2 ) in reaction buﬀer ( 100 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) at 24 ◦ C for 30 min . The turbidity of the reacted proteins was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 470 nm using a spectrophotometer ( Ultrospec 2000 ; Pharmacia Biotech ) . Graphs of absorbance at 470 nm were ﬁtted using OriginPro 9 . 1 software ( OriginLab Corporation , Northampton , MA , USA ) .

In vitro Actin - Binding Assay Actin co - sedimentation assays were performed as previously reported ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . In brief , non - muscle actin ( 85 % β - actin and 15 % γ - actin ) , derived from human platelets , and muscle actin ( α - actin ) , derived from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) , were mixed in G - buﬀer ( 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) to produce actin stock and polymerized in an actin polymerization buﬀer ( 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) at 24 ◦ C for 1 h . Solutions containing polymerized actin ( 8 µ M ) were incubated with bovine serum albumin ( BSA , 4 µ M ) , EFhd1 ( 12 µ M ) , or EFhd2 ( 12 µ M ) for 30 min at 24 ◦ C in the presence of 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) or 1 mM CaCl 2 . Actin ﬁlaments with each protein were pelleted via centrifugation at 100 , 000 × g for 2 h at 24 ◦ C ( for the actin - binding assay ) . BSA and EFhd2 were used as negative and positive controls , respectively . Equal amounts of pellet and supernatant were resolved via SDS - PAGE , and the protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining . The percentage of each protein in the pellet was quantiﬁed via densitometry using ImageJ 1 . 44p , and the percentage of pellet histogram was plotted using OriginPro 9 . 1 software ( OriginLab Corporation , Northampton , MA , USA ) ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . Negative Staining Electron Microscopy Imaging Non - muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) was polymerized in F - actin buﬀer containing 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 0 . 2 mM Tris - HCl at pH 8 . 0 . Mixtures ( 50 µ L ) of F - actin ( 4 µ M ) and full - length EFhd1 ( 6 µ M ) in the presence of 1 mM EGTA or 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 were allowed to react for 1 h . For grid preparation , 2 µ L of reaction mixture was loaded onto the Formvar and metal - coated grids and blotted with ﬁlter paper to remove excess samples . The sample - loaded grid was stained using a solution of 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate . The grids were immersed in the stain solution for 20 min , blotted with ﬁlter paper to remove excess stain , and air - dried . The samples were analyzed using an FEI Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV . RESULTS Overall Structure of the EFhd1 Core Domain in the Ca 2 + - Bound State We determined the crystal structure of the core domain of mouse EFhd1 ( CD EFhd1 , residues 79 – 180 ) at a resolution of 2 . 07 Å and reﬁned to R work = 20 . 9 ( % ) and R free = 22 . 9 ( % ) ( Table 1 ) . We initially attempted to crystallize the EFhd1 1 NTD ( residues 69 – 240 ) construct , but only the core domain was crystallized due to proteolytic degradation ( Figure 1A ) . The CD EFhd1 structure comprised two EF - hand motifs ( residues 91 – 162 ) , an LM - helix ( residues 169 – 176 ) , a C - terminus of the PR region ( residues 79 – 89 ) at the N - terminus , and a C - terminal linker ( residues 177 – 180 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Within the structure , Ca 2 + ions were coordinated in each of the two EF - hand motifs of CD EFhd1 ( Figures 1C , D ) . Consensus residues for Ca 2 + coordination in the EF - hand consist of 12 amino acids with patterns of 1 ( X ) , 3 ( Y ) , 5 ( Z ) , 7 ( - Y ) , 9 ( - X ) , and 12 ( - Z ) comprised of the ﬁve monodentate ligands and one bidentate ligand for - Z ( Lewit - Bentley and Rety , 2000 ) . Consequently , the geometry for Ca 2 + coordination of the EF - hand is generally pentagonal bipyramid with a coordination number of seven comprising six oxygen atoms from the side chains and one main - chain carbonyl oxygen of - Y ( Lewit - Bentley and Rety , 2000 ; Grabarek , 2006 ) . In the case of EF - hand 1 of CD EFhd1 , two water molecules participated in the Ca 2 + coordination instead of the residues in position Y ( G106 ) and - X ( D112 ) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Notably , this alternative pattern of Ca 2 + coordination formed a distorted pentagonal bipyramid geometry . Unlike EF - hand 1 , in the case of Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 4 January 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 628222 Mun et al .

The interacting residues are represented in stick form , and the hydrogen bonds are marked by dashed lines . ( F ) Detailed view of the interaction between the LM - helix and two EF - hand motifs . The interacting residues are represented in stick form . EF - hand 2 of CD EFhd1 , one water molecule participated in Ca 2 + coordination instead of the residues in position - X ( S148 ) . The Ca 2 + coordination geometry of EF - hand 2 was maintained in the general pentagonal bipyramid . Collectively , EF - hand 1 and EF - hand 2 of CD EFhd1 had a distorted or general geometry for Ca 2 + coordination , respectively . The structure of the motifs in CD EFhd1 was stabilized by hydrophobic intramolecular interactions . In the PR region ( helix α 1 ) , three Phe residues ( F79 , F85 , and F88 ) formed hydrophobic interactions with L153 and L154 of helix α 5 of EF - hand 2 ( Figure 1E ) . The interaction of the PR region and helix α 5 was further stabilized through the hydrogen bond Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 5 January 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 628222 Mun et al . Crystal Structure of EFhd1 / Swiprosin - 2 network comprising E84 ( PR region ) , E87 ( PR region ) , E141 ( interloop of EF - hand 2 ) , R150 ( helix α 5 ) , H157 ( helix α 5 ) , and a glycerol molecule ( gray ) . The LM - helix was stabilized by the intramolecular hydrophobic interaction network comprising the LM - helix ( L170 , L173 , A174 ) , helix α 2 ( M99 ) , helix α 3 ( L116 , M119 , M120 , L123 ) , helix α 4 ( M135 ) , and helix α 5 ( F152 , I155 , F156 , A159 ) ( Figure 1F ) . In the case of the C - terminal linker , I179 formed hydrophobic interactions with L92 , L96 of helix α 2 , and F156 of helix α 5 . Collectively , CD EFhd1 formed a compact and rigid domain structure through these intramolecular interactions . Structural Comparison Between the Core Domain of EFhd1 , EFhd2 , and AIF - 1 The genes encoding EFhd1 , EFhd2 , and AIF - 1 evolved from the common ancestral species of Bilateria ( Dutting et al . , 2011 ) . The sequences of EFhd1 and EFhd2 are highly conserved , with a sequence identity of 65 % , but the sequence of AIF - 1 is conserved with that of EFhd1 only in the EF - hand motifs with an overall sequence identity of 15 % due to the diﬀerence in evolutionary branching . Although the sequence conservation was limited to the EF - hand motifs in AIF - 1 , the overall structures of these proteins for Ca 2 + - bound states were relatively well - superimposed ( RMSD of CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 = 0 . 403 Å for 85 C α atoms , RMSD of CD EFhd1 and AIF - 1 = 2 . 089 Å for 63 C α atoms ) ( Figure 2A ) . EF - hand motifs of these proteins accommodate a helix ( LM - helix in CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 , and helix E in AIF - 1 ) , comparable with the binding mode of the calmodulin - ligand interaction ( Durvanger and Harmat , 2019 ) . When we compared the Ca 2 + - bound CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 , the LM - helices of both proteins participated in the intramolecular hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic groove of the EF - hands , and the hydrophobic interaction networks of CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 were structurally conserved ( Figures 2B , C ) ( Park et al . , 2016 ) . Unlike the LM - helix of CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 , the helix E of Ca 2 + - bound AIF - 1 formed intermolecular hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic groove of two EF - hands in a symmetry - mate molecule , resulting in the dimer formation of AIF - 1 ( Yamada et al . , 2006 ) . When we compared the intramolecular interactions in CD EFhd1 and the intermolecular interactions in AIF - 1 , a distinct hydrophobic interaction network between the hydrophobic groove of the EF - hands and the accommodated helix ( LM - helix in CD EFhd1 and helix E ′ in AIF - 1 ) was found ( Figures 2B , D ) . Collectively , the overall structure of CD EFhd1 was similar to that of CD EFhd2 and AIF - 1 , but the hydrophobic interaction network between the LM - helix and hydrophobic groove of EF - hands in CD EFhd1 was similar to that of CD EFhd2 , but not AIF - 1 . To compare the EF - hand motifs of CD EFhd1 , CD EFhd2 , and AIF - 1 , we superimposed the structures based on EF - hand 1 or 2 . In CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 , EF - hand 1 coordinated Ca 2 + , and the Ca 2 + coordinating residues were well - superimposed ( RMSD = 0 . 269 Å for 36 C α atoms ) ( Figure 2E ) . However , the EF - hand 1 of AIF - 1 could not coordinate Ca 2 + because there was no space for Ca 2 + coordination due to the β - turn , which was stabilized by a hydrogen bond network comprised of N60 , N62 , and D64 ( Yamada et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 2F ) . In addition , the consensus residues for the EF - hand 1 of AIF - 1 were not conserved with those of CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Although EF - hand 2 of these proteins could coordinate Ca 2 + , the geometries for Ca 2 + coordination were distinct . The EF - hand 2 of EFhd1 and EFhd2 formed geometries of the pentagonal bipyramid for Ca 2 + coordination , but that of AIF - 1 formed a trigonal bipyramidal geometry ( Figures 2E , F ) . This originated from the diﬀerences in sequences between AIF - 1 and EFhd1 or EFhd2 . The canonical EF - hand domain has two helix - loop - helix motifs comprising four helices ( helix 1 , helix 2 , helix 3 , and helix 4 ) and forms two hydrophobic clusters ( I and II ) ( Denessiouk et al . , 2014 ) . Helices 1 and 4 form hydrophobic cluster I , comprising three aromatic residues , and helices 2 and 3 usually form hydrophobic cluster II , comprising a combination of aromatic , hydrophobic , and polar amino acids . Based on the conformational changes of the hydrophobic clusters I and II upon Ca 2 + binding , EF - hand - containing proteins can be classiﬁed into ﬁve separate types ( Denessiouk et al . , 2014 ) . A previous report suggested that CD EFhd2 belongs to type I , which maintains an open conformation , secondary structures , and cluster interactions independent of Ca 2 + ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013 ; Park et al . , 2016 ) . Although we could not determine the type of CD EFhd1 due to the lack of the structure of the apo - state , we expected that CD EFhd1 also belonged to type I because of its structure and sequence similarity with CD EFhd2 ( Figure 2A , Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Indeed , the structures of the EF - hand motifs comprising hydrophobic clusters were highly conserved in CD EFhd1 and CD EFhd2 [ RMSDs of EF - hand motifs , cluster I , and cluster II are 0 . 334 Å ( for 66 C α atoms ) , 0 . 266 Å ( for 25 C α atoms ) , and 0 . 177 Å ( for 22 C α atoms ) , respectively ] . In addition , the sequences of the EF - hands in both proteins were highly conserved with a sequence identity of 85 % ( hydrophobic cluster I : F100 , F149 , and F152 in EFhd1 ; F101 , F150 , and F153 in EFhd2 ; hydrophobic cluster II : L113 , L116 , and I136 in EFhd1 ; L114 , L117 , and I137 in EFhd2 ) . Therefore , CD EFhd1 was classiﬁed as type I . Zn 2 + Ions in the Crystal Packing Interfaces of the EFhd1 Core Domain In the electron density map ( F obs - F calc ) of CD EFhd1 , we observed two strong unidentiﬁed electron density maps located at the interfaces of the symmetry - mate molecules ( Figure 3A ) . We further analyzed the unidentiﬁed electron density based on the metal coordinating geometric analysis performed with the CheckMyMetal and MetalPDB server ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ; Putignano et al . , 2018 ) . The coordination geometry was predicted to be tetrahedron , which is the major geometry for Zn 2 + coordination . In addition , with the addition of 5 mM ZnSO 4 to the crystallization condition , we expected that Zn 2 + ions ( Zn 1 and Zn 2 ) would be present in the maps . We identiﬁed two Zn 2 + - mediated interactions between one CD EFhd1 ( MolA ) and other symmetry - mate molecules ( MolB and MolC ) ( Figures 3B , C ) . Zn 1 was coordinated by H129 ( MolB ) , K133 ( MolB ) , H157 ( MolA ) , and E163 ( MolA ) , and Zn 2 was coordinated by D142 Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 6 January 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 628222 Mun et al .

The samples mixed with various concentrations of ZnCl 2 ( 0 . 02 , 0 . 2 , 1 , 2 , and 10mM ) were centrifuged to separate supernatant ( S ) and precipitant ( P ) fractions , and the P fractions were analyzed via SDS - PAGE . interface 2 . Therefore , interface 1 might contribute more to the Zn 2 + - mediated multimerization of the EFhd1 than interface 2 . The Zn 1 coordinating residues in EFhd1 ( H129 , K133 , H157 , and E163 ) were highly conserved with those in EFhd2 ( H130 , K134 , R158 , and E164 ) , except H157 in EFhd1 , which was replaced by R158 in EFhd2 ( Figure 3D , Supplementary Figure 1 ) . As histidine is a major ligand for Zn 2 + , we expected that the Zn 2 + - mediated multimerization of EFhd1 would be observed to a greater degree than that of EFhd2 . To evaluate the diﬀerence between the Zn 2 + - mediated multimerization of EFhd1 and EFhd2 , we performed Zn 2 + - dependent precipitation assays and turbidity measurements . In the precipitation assays , we found that the precipitation ratio of EFhd1 and EFhd2 increased in proportion to [ Zn 2 + ] ( Figures 3E , F ) . Consistent with the precipitation assays , the turbidities of both proteins increased with a [ Zn 2 + ] ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) , and we obtained the K agg 1 / 2 ( concentration of half maximal protein aggregation for Zn 2 + ) of 0 . 41 ± 0 . 02 mM for EFhd1 and 5 . 9 ± 0 . 4 mM for EFhd2 . Therefore , we concluded that EFhd1 and EFhd2 could be multimerized by Zn 2 + , and EFhd1 was more sensitive to Zn 2 + than EFhd2 for multimerization . Actin - Binding and - Bundling Activities of EFhd1 EFhd2 and AIF - 1 , which belong to the EF - hand superfamily proteins , have F - actin - binding and - bundling activities ( Sasaki Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 8 January 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 628222 Mun et al .

As EFhd1 also belongs to the EF - hand superfamily proteins and has a high sequence similarity with EFhd2 , we expected that EFhd1 would also be involved in F - actin - binding and - bundling . To measure the actin - binding activity , we performed in vitro high - speed co - sedimentation assays using β - actin with full - length EFhd1 or EFhd2 ( Figure 4A ) . The co - sedimentation ratios of EFhd1 and EFhd2 in the presence of Ca 2 + were 36 ± 2 % ( all errors of means are at 95 % conﬁdence interval ) and 24 ± 2 % , respectively . In the absence of Ca 2 + , the co - sedimentation ratios of EFhd1 and EFhd2 were 36 ± 2 % and 19 ± 2 % , respectively . Both proteins were Ca 2 + - independently co - sedimented with β - actin , but the sedimentation ratio of EFhd1 was 1 . 7 - fold higher than that of EFhd2 . This suggested that EFhd1 has a higher binding aﬃnity for β - actin than EFhd2 , independent of Ca 2 + . While α - actin is localized in the cytosol , β - actin is localized not only in the cytosol but also in the mitochondrial matrix ( Storch et al . , 2007 ; Reyes et al . , 2011 ; Xie et al . , 2018 ) . We hypothesized that the binding aﬃnity of EFhd1 for β - actin may diﬀer from that of α - actin because EFhd1 is localized in mitochondria ( Tominaga et al . , 2006 ) . We performed co - sedimentation assays using α - actin with full - length EFhd1 or EFhd2 ( Figure 4B ) . The co - sedimentation ratios of EFhd1 and EFhd2 in the presence of Ca 2 + were 20 ± 2 % and 19 ± 2 % , respectively . In the absence of Ca 2 + , the co - sedimentation ratios of EFhd1 and EFhd2 were 21 ± 2 % and 19 ± 2 % , respectively . Both proteins were similarly co - sedimented with α - actin independent of Ca 2 + , and the sedimentation ratio of EFhd1 was comparable to that of EFhd2 , suggesting similar α - actin - binding aﬃnities of EFhd1 and EFhd2 . When we compared the sedimentation ratio of EFhd1 for α - and β - actin , the sedimentation ratio for β - actin was 1 . 8 - fold higher than that for α - actin , suggesting that EFhd1 has higher binding aﬃnities for β - actin than α - actin . In the case of EFhd2 , the sedimentation ratio for α - and β - actin was similar , suggesting similar binding aﬃnities of EFhd2 for α - and β - actin . Collectively , EFhd1 had a higher actin - binding aﬃnity for β - actin than that for α - actin regardless of Ca 2 + , and EFhd2 had a similar actin - binding aﬃnity for α - and β - actin independent of Ca 2 + ( Figure 4C ) . In addition to the co - sedimentation assays , we performed negative staining electron microscopy imaging with EFhd1 and F - actin ( β - actin ) to identify the actin - bundling activity of EFhd1 ( Figures 4D – F ) . In the electron micrographs , we found the F - actin bundles only in the presence of Ca 2 + , suggesting the Ca 2 + - dependent actin - bundling activity of EFhd1 . Meanwhile , the F - actin - bundling activity of EFhd1 for β - actin was lower than that of EFhd2 for α - actin ( Huh et al . , 2013 ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 9 January 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 628222 Mun et al . Crystal Structure of EFhd1 / Swiprosin - 2 Collectively , EFhd1 had a Ca 2 + - dependent β - actin - bundling activity , which is lower than the α - actin - bundling activity of EFhd2 . DISCUSSION This study demonstrated the crystal structure of the EFhd1 core domain , whose overall structure was similar to that of EFhd2 and AIF - 1 . We found two Zn 2 + ions in the crystal packing interface , providing new insights into the Zn 2 + - mediated multimerization of EFhd1 . In addition , we ﬁrst identiﬁed the actin - binding and - bundling activities of EFhd1 in vitro . For β - actin , EFhd1 had Ca 2 + - independent β - actin - binding and Ca 2 + - dependent β - actin - bundling activities . EFhd1 bound not only to β - actin , but also to α - actin in vitro , which is the primary actin isoform in the cytosol , implying that EFhd1 could bind to α - actin in the cytosol . We identiﬁed the Zn 2 + - mediated aggregation of EFhd1 with K agg 1 / 2 = 0 . 41 ± 0 . 02 mM . Mitochondrial [ Zn 2 + ] remains controversial , but it is estimated to be in the submicromolar range in the Zn 2 + overload state ( Sensi et al . , 2003 ; Park et al . , 2012 ; Chabosseau et al . , 2014 ) . Although [ Zn 2 + ] for half aggregation of EFhd1 in vitro was much higher than that of mitochondrial [ Zn 2 + ] , and the concentration of EFhd1 may diﬀer between in vitro and physiological conditions , we cannot rule out the possibility of the multimerization of EFhd1 in the Zn 2 + overload state because the local spatial and temporal mitochondrial [ Zn 2 + ] may be much higher than the reported micromolar range . It will be interesting to study the structural and functional role of Zn 2 + ions in actin - binding and - bundling activities . In the cytosol , [ Zn 2 + ] is tightly regulated from the picomolar to nanomolar range , suggesting that the Zn 2 + - mediated multimerization of EFhd1 may not occur in the cytosol ( Kambe et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , we suggest that EFhd1 binds to actin and is multimerized by Zn 2 + in the mitochondria . EFhd1 KO neurons showed alterations in mitochondrial morphology to a shortened shape , and the mitochondrial morphology could be aﬀected by β - actin regulation ( Xie et al . , 2018 ; Ulisse et al . , 2020 ) . We found that EFhd1 had Ca 2 + - independent β - actin - binding and Ca 2 + - dependent β - actin - bundling activities ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , we suggest that EFhd1 binds to β - actin in the resting state and induces β - actin - bundling in the Ca 2 + overload state of mitochondria . The regulation of β - actin not only aﬀects mitochondrial morphology but also the energy synthesis of mitochondria . The energy synthesis of mitochondria is reduced when the expression of efhd1 is downregulated ( Stein et al . , 2017 ; Ulisse et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , we suggest that EFhd1 induces actin rearrangement in the mitochondria , resulting in changes in energy synthesis . In this study , we determined the crystal structure of mouse EFhd1 without C - terminal coiled - coil , and proposed Zn 2 + - mediated EFhd1 multimerization . In addition , we unveiled the actin - binding and - bundling activities of EFhd1 . Nevertheless , the C - terminal coiled - coil is important for understanding the actin regulation mechanism of EFhd1 . The coiled - coil of EFhd1 is expected to be important for the dimerization of EFhd1 and actin - bundling activity because these regions are highly conserved in EFhd1 and EFhd2 ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , to understand the structural and functional role of EFhd1 , structural studies on the full - length EFhd1 and EFhd1 - actin ﬁlament complexes need to be performed .
