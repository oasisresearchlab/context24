The densest , in human lymphoblas - toid cells , contains 4 . 9 billion contacts , achieving 1 kb resolution . We ﬁnd that genomes are partitioned into contact domains ( median length , 185 kb ) , which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments . We identify (cid:1) 10 , 000 loops . These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers , correlate with gene activation , and show conservation across cell types and species . Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF . CTCF sites at loop an - chors occur predominantly ( > 90 % ) in a convergent orientation , with the asymmetric motifs ‘‘facing’’ one another . The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF - binding repeats . INTRODUCTION The spatial organization of the human genome is known to play an important role in the transcriptional control of genes ( Cremer and Cremer , 2001 ; Sexton et al . , 2007 ; Bickmore , 2013 ) . Yet important questions remain , like how distal regulatory elements , such as enhancers , affect promoters , and how insulators can abrogate these effects ( Banerji et al . , 1981 ; Blackwood and Kadonaga , 1998 ; Gaszner and Felsenfeld , 2006 ) . Both phenom - ena are thought to involve the formation of protein - mediated ‘‘loops’’ that bring pairs of genomic sites that lie far apart along the linear genome into proximity ( Schleif , 1992 ) . Various methods have emerged to assess the 3D architecture of the nucleus . In one seminal study , the binding of a protein to sites at opposite ends of a restriction fragment created a loop , which was detectable because it promoted the formation of DNA circles in the presence of ligase . Removal of the protein or either of its binding sites disrupted the loop , eliminating this ‘‘cyclization enhancement’’ ( Mukherjee et al . , 1988 ) . Subsequent adaptations of cyclization enhancement made it possible to analyze chromatin folding in vivo , including nuclear ligation assay ( Cullen et al . , 1993 ) and chromosome conformation capture ( Dekker et al . , 2002 ) , which analyze contacts made by a single locus , extensions such as 5C for examining several loci simultaneously ( Dostie et al . , 2006 ) , and methods such as ChIA - PET for examining all loci bound by a speciﬁc protein ( Full - wood et al . , 2009 ) . To interrogate all loci at once , we developed Hi - C , which com - bines DNA proximity ligation with high - throughput sequencing in a genome - wide fashion ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) . We used Hi - C to demonstrate that the genome is partitioned into nu - merous domains that fall into two distinct compartments . Subse - quent analyses have suggested the presence of smaller domains and have led to the important proposal that compartments are partitioned into condensed structures (cid:1) 1 Mb in size , dubbed ‘‘topologically associated domains’’ ( TADs ) ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ) . In principle , Hi - C could also be used to detect loops across the entire genome . To achieve this , how - ever , extremely large data sets and rigorous computational methods are needed . Recent efforts have suggested that this is an increasingly plausible goal ( Sexton et al . , 2012 ; Jin et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we report the results of an effort to comprehensively map chromatin contacts genome - wide , using in situ Hi - C , in which DNA - DNA proximity ligation is performed in intact nuclei . The protocol facilitates the generation of much denser Hi - C maps . The maps reported here comprise over 5 Tb of sequence Cell 159 , 1665 – 1680 , December 18 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 1665 data recording over 15 billion distinct contacts , an order of magnitude larger than all published Hi - C data sets combined . Using these maps , we are able to clearly discern domain struc - ture , compartmentalization , and thousands of chromatin loops . In addition to haploid maps , we were also able to create diploid maps analyzing each chromosomal homolog separately . The maps provide a picture of genomic architecture with resolution down to 1 kb . RESULTS In Situ Hi - C Methodology and Maps Our in situ Hi - C protocol combines our original Hi - C protocol ( here called dilution Hi - C ) with nuclear ligation assay ( Cullen et al . , 1993 ) , in which DNA is digested using a restriction enzyme , DNA - DNA proximity ligation is performed in intact nuclei , and the resulting ligation junctions are quantiﬁed . Our in situ Hi - C protocol involves crosslinking cells with formaldehyde , permea - bilizing them with nuclei intact , digesting DNA with a suitable 4 - cutter restriction enzyme ( such as MboI ) , ﬁlling the 5 0 - over - hangs while incorporating a biotinylated nucleotide , ligating the resulting blunt - end fragments , shearing the DNA , capturing the biotinylated ligation junctions with streptavidin beads , and analyzing the resulting fragments with paired - end sequencing ( Figure 1A ) . This protocol resembles a recently published sin - gle - cell Hi - C protocol ( Nagano et al . , 2013 ) , which also per - formed DNA - DNA proximity ligation inside nuclei to study nuclear architecture in individual cells . Our updated protocol has three major advantages over dilution Hi - C . First , in situ liga - tion reduces the frequency of spurious contacts due to random ligation in dilute solution—as evidenced by a lower frequency of junctions between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in the captured fragments and by the higher frequency of random liga - tions observed when the supernatant is sequenced ( Extended Experimental Procedures available online ) . This is consistent with a recent study showing that ligation junctions formed in solution are far less meaningful ( Gavrilov et al . , 2013 ) . Second , the protocol is faster , requiring 3 days instead of 7 ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Third , it enables higher resolution and more efﬁcient cutting of chromatinized DNA , for instance , through the use of a 4 - cutter rather than a 6 - cutter ( Data S1 , I ) . A Hi - C map is a list of DNA - DNA contacts produced by a Hi - C experiment . By partitioning the linear genome into ‘‘loci’’ of ﬁxed size ( e . g . , bins of 1 Mb or 1 kb ) , the Hi - C map can be represented as a ‘‘contact matrix’’ M , where the entry M i , j is the number of contacts observed between locus L i and locus L j . ( A ‘‘contact’’ is a read pair that remains after we exclude reads that are duplicates , that correspond to unligated fragments , or that do not align uniquely to the genome . ) The contact matrix can be visualized as a heatmap , whose entries we call ‘‘pixels . ’’ An ‘‘in - terval’’ refers to a set of consecutive loci ; the contacts between two intervals thus form a ‘‘rectangle’’ or ‘‘square’’ in the contact matrix . We deﬁne the ‘‘matrix resolution’’ of a Hi - C map as the locus size used to construct a particular contact matrix and the ‘‘map resolution’’ as the smallest locus size such that 80 % of loci have at least 1 , 000 contacts . The map resolution is meant to reﬂect the ﬁnest scale at which one can reliably discern local features . Contact Maps Spanning Nine Cell Lines Containing over 15 Billion Contacts We constructed in situ Hi - C maps of nine cell lines in human and mouse ( Table S1 ) . Whereas our original Hi - C experiments had a map resolution of 1 Mb , these maps have a resolution of 1 kb or 5 kb . Our largest map , in human GM12878 B - lympho - blastoid cells , contains 4 . 9 billion pairwise contacts and has a map resolution of 950 bp ( ‘‘kilobase resolution’’ ) ( Table S2 ) . We also generated eight in situ Hi - C maps at 5 kb resolution , using cell lines representing all human germ layers ( IMR90 , HMEC , NHEK , K562 , HUVEC , HeLa , and KBM7 ) as well as mouse B - lymphoblasts ( CH12 - LX ) ( Table S1 ) . Each map contains be - tween 395 M and 1 . 1 B contacts . When we used our original dilution Hi - C protocol to generate maps of GM12878 , IMR90 , HMEC , NHEK , HUVEC , and CH12 - LX , we found that , as expected , in situ Hi - C maps were superior at high resolutions , but closely resembled dilution Hi - C at lower resolutions . For instance , our dilution map of GM12878 ( 3 . 2 billion contacts ) correlated highly with our in situ map at 500 , 50 , and 25 kb resolutions ( R > 0 . 96 , 0 . 90 , and 0 . 87 , respectively ) ( Data S1 , I ; Figure S1 ) . Wealso performed112supplementaryHi - Cexperimentsusing three different protocols ( in situ Hi - C , dilution Hi - C , and Tethered Conformation Capture ) while varying a wide array of conditions such as extent of crosslinking , restriction enzyme , ligation vol - ume / time , and biotinylated nucleotide . These include several in situ Hi - C experiments in which the formaldehyde crosslinking step was omitted , which demonstrate that the structural features we observe cannot be due to the crosslinking procedure . In total , 201independentHi - Cexperimentsweresuccessfullyperformed , many of which are presented in Data S1 and S2 . To account for nonuniformities in coverage due to the number of restriction sites at a locus or the accessibility of those sites to cutting ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ; Yaffe and Tanay , 2011 ) we use a matrix - balancing algorithm due to Knight and Ruiz ( 2012 ) ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Adequate tools for visualization of these large data sets are essential . We have therefore created the ‘‘Juicebox’’ visualiza - tion system that enables users to explore contact matrices , zoom in and out , compare Hi - C matrices to 1D tracks , superim - pose all features reported in this paper onto the data , and contrast different Hi - C maps . All contact data and feature sets reported here can be explored interactively via Juicebox at http : / / www . aidenlab . org / juicebox / . The Genome Is Partitioned into Small Domains Whose Median Length Is 185 kb We began by probing the 3D partitioning of the genome . In our earlier experiments at 1 Mb map resolution ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) , we saw large squares of enhanced contact fre - quency tiling the diagonal of the contact matrices . These squares partitioned the genome into 5 – 20 Mb intervals , which we call ‘‘megadomains . ’’ We also found that individual 1 Mb loci could be assigned to one of two long - range contact patterns , which we called com - partments A and B , with loci in the same compartment showing more frequent interaction . Megadomains—and the associated squares along the diagonal—arise when all of the 1 Mb loci in 1666 Cell 159 , 1665 – 1680 , December 18 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . A B C D Figure 1 .

The Genome Is Partitioned into Contact Domains that Segregate into Nuclear Subcompartments Corresponding to Different Patterns of Histone Modiﬁcations ( A ) We annotate thousands of domains across the genome ( left , black highlight ) . To do so , we deﬁne an arrowhead matrix A ( right ) such that A i , i + d = ( M * i , i - d – M * i , i + d ) / ( M * i , i - d + M * i , i + d ) , where M * is the normalized contact matrix . This transformation replaces domains with an arrowhead - shaped motif pointing toward the domain’s upper - left corner ( example in yellow ) ; we identify these arrowheads using dynamic programming .

The ﬂanking domains have long - range contact patterns that differ from one another and are preserved in both ( legend continued on next page ) 1668 Cell 159 , 1665 – 1680 , December 18 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . an interval exhibit the same genome - wide contact pattern . Compartment A is highly enriched for open chromatin ; compart - ment B is enriched for closed chromatin ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ; Kalhor et al . , 2012 ; Sexton et al . , 2012 ) . In our new , higher resolution maps ( 200 - to 1 , 000 - fold more contacts ) , we observe many small squares of enhanced contact frequency that tile the diagonal of each contact matrix ( Fig - ure 2A ) . We used the Arrowhead algorithm ( see Experimental Procedures ) to annotate these contact domains genome - wide . The observed domains ranged in size from 40 kb to 3 Mb ( median size 185 kb ) . As with megadomains , there is an abrupt drop in contact frequency ( 33 % ) for pairs of loci on opposite sides of the domain boundary ( Figure S2G ) . Contact domains are often preserved across cell types ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . The presence of smaller domains in Hi - C maps is consistent with several other recent studies ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ; Sexton et al . , 2012 ) . We explore the relationship be - tween the domains we annotate and those annotated in prior studies in the Discussion . Contact Domains Exhibit Consistent Histone Marks Whose Changes Are Associated with Changes in Long - Range Contact Pattern Loci within a contact domain show correlated histone modi - ﬁcations for eight different factors ( H3K36me3 , H3K27me3 , H3K4me1 , H3K4me2 , H3K4me3 , H3K9me3 , H3K79me2 , and H4K20me1 ) based on data from the ENCODE project in GM12878 cells ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) . By contrast , loci at comparable distance but residing in different do - mains showed much less correlation in chromatin state ( Figures 2B , S2I , and S2K ; Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Strik - ingly , changes in a domain’s chromatin state are often accompa - nied by changes in the long - range contact pattern of domain loci ( i . e . , the pattern of contacts between loci in the domain and other loci genome - wide ) , indicating that changes in chromatin pattern are accompanied by shifts in a domain’s nuclear neighborhood ( Figures 2C and S3C – S3E ; Extended Experimental Procedures ) . This observation is consistent with microscopy studies associ - ating changes in gene expression with changes in nuclear local - ization ( Finlan et al . , 2008 ) . There Are at Least Six Nuclear Subcompartments with Distinct Patterns of Histone Modiﬁcations Next , we partitioned loci into categories based on long - range contact patterns alone , using four independent approaches : manual annotation and three unsupervised clustering algorithms ( HMM , K - means , Hierarchical ) . All gave similar results ( Fig - ure S4B ; Extended Experimental Procedures ) . We then investi - gated the biological meaning of these categories . When we analyzed the data at low matrix resolution ( 1 Mb ) , we reproduced our earlier ﬁnding of two compartments ( A and B ) . At high resolution ( 25 kb ) , we found evidence for at least ﬁve ‘‘sub - compartments’’ deﬁned by their long - range interaction patterns , both within and between chromosomes . These ﬁndings expand on earlier reports suggesting three compartments in human cells ( Yaffe and Tanay , 2011 ) . We found that the median length of an interval lying completely within a subcompartment is 300 kb . Although the subcompartments are deﬁned solely based on their Hi - C interaction patterns , they exhibit distinct genomic and epi - genomic content . Two of the ﬁve interaction patterns are correlated with loci in compartment A ( Figure S4E ) . We label the loci exhibiting these patterns as belonging to subcompartments A1 and A2 . Both A1 and A2 are gene dense , have highly expressed genes , harbor activating chromatin marks such as H3K36me3 , H3K79me2 , H3K27ac , and H3K4me1 and are depleted at the nuclear lamina and at nucleolus - associated domains ( NADs ) ( Figures 2D , 2E , and S4I ; Table S3 ) . While both A1 and A2 exhibit early replication times , A1 ﬁnishes replicating at the beginning of S phase , whereas A2 continues replicating into the middle of S phase . A2 is more strongly associated with the presence of H3K9me3 than A1 , has lower GC content , and contains longer genes ( 2 . 4 - fold ) . The other three interaction patterns ( labeled B1 , B2 , and B3 ) are correlated with loci in compartment B ( Figure S4E ) and show very different properties . Subcompartment B1 correlates positively with H3K27me3 and negatively with H3K36me3 , sug - gestive of facultative heterochromatin ( Figures 2D and 2E ) . Replication of this subcompartment peaks during the middle of S phase . Subcompartments B2 and B3 tend to lack all of the above - noted marks and do not replicate until the end of S phase ( see Figure 2D ) . Subcompartment B2 includes 62 % of pericen - tromeric heterochromatin ( 3 . 8 - fold enrichment ) and is enriched at the nuclear lamina ( 1 . 8 - fold ) and at NADs ( 4 . 6 - fold ) . Subcom - partment B3 is enriched at the nuclear lamina ( 1 . 6 - fold ) , but strongly depleted at NADs ( 76 - fold ) . Upon closer visual examination , we noticed the presence of a sixth pattern on chromosome 19 ( Figure 2F ) . Our genome - wide clustering algorithm missed this pattern because it spans only 11 Mb , or 0 . 3 % of the genome . When we repeated the algorithm on chromosome 19 alone , the additional pattern was detected . Because this sixth pattern correlates with the Compartment B pattern , we labeled it B4 . Subcompartment B4 comprises a handful of regions , each of which contains many KRAB - ZNF su - perfamily genes . ( B4 contains 130 of the 278 KRAB - ZNF genes in the genome , a 65 - fold enrichment ) . As noted in previous studies ( Vogel et al . , 2006 ; Hahn et al . , 2011 ) , these regions exhibit a highly distinctive chromatin pattern , with strong enrichment for cell types . In IMR90 , the highlighted domain is marked by H3K36me3 and its long - range contact pattern matches the similarly - marked domain on the left . In GM12878 , it is decorated withH3K27me3 , and the long - range pattern switches , matching thesimilarly - marked domain to theright . Diagonal submatrices , 10kb resolution ; long - range interaction matrices , 50 kb resolution . ( D ) Each of the six long - range contact patterns we observe exhibits a distinct epigenetic proﬁle ( data sources are listed in Table S3 ) . Each subcompartment also has a visually distinctive contact pattern . ( E ) Each example shows part of the long - range contact patterns for several nearby genomic intervals lying in different subcompartments . ( F ) A large contiguous region on chromosome 19 contains intervals in subcompartments A1 , B1 , B2 , and B4 . See also Figures S2 , S3 , and S4 and Data S1 , III – IV .

Approximately 10 , 000 Peaks Mark the Position of Chromatin Loops We next sought to identify the positions of chromatin loops by using an algorithm to search for pairs of loci that show signiﬁ - cantly closer proximity with one another than with the loci lying between them ( Figure 3A ) . Such pairs correspond to pixels with higher contact frequency than typical pixels in their neigh - borhood . We refer to these pixels as ‘‘peaks’’ in the Hi - C contact matrix and to the corresponding pair of loci as ‘‘peak loci . ’’ Peaks reﬂect the presence of chromatin loops , with the peak loci being the anchor points of the chromatin loop . ( Because contact fre - quencies vary across the genome , we deﬁne peak pixels relative to the local background . We note that some papers [ Sanyal et al . , 2012 ; Jin et al . , 2013 ] have sought to deﬁne peaks relative to a genome - wide average . This choice is problematic because , for example , many pixels within a domain may be reported as peaks despite showing no locally distinctive proximity ; see Discussion . ) Our algorithm detected 9 , 448 peaks in the in situ Hi - C map for GM12878 at 5 kb matrix resolution . These peaks are associated with a total of 12 , 903 distinct peak loci ( some peak loci are asso - ciated with more than one peak ) . The vast majority of peaks ( 98 % ) reﬂected loops between loci that are < 2 Mb apart . These ﬁndings were reproducible across all of our high - reso - lution Hi - C maps . Examining the primary and replicate maps separately , we found 8 , 054 peaks in the former and 7 , 484 peaks in the latter , with 5 , 403 in both lists ( see Figures 3A and 3B ; Data S1 , V ; Table S4 ) . The differences were almost always the result of our conservative peak - calling criteria ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . We also called peaks using our GM12878 dilution Hi - C experiment . Because the map is sparser and thus noisier , we called only 3 , 073 peaks . Nonetheless , 65 % of these peaks were also present in the list of peaks from our in situ Hi - C data set , again reﬂecting high interreplicate reproducibility . To independently conﬁrm that peak loci are closer than neigh - boring locus pairs , we performed 3D - FISH ( Beliveau et al . , 2012 ) on four loops ( Table S5 ) . In each case , we compared two peak loci , L1 and L2 , with a control locus , L3 , that lies an equal genomic distance away from L2 but on the opposite side ( Fig - ures 3C and S5B ) . In all cases , the 3D - distance between L1 and L2 was consistently shorter than the 3D - distance between L2 and L3 ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . We also conﬁrmed that our list of peaks was consistent with previously published Hi - C maps . Although earlier maps con - tained too few contacts to reliably call individual peaks , we developed a method called Aggregate Peak Analysis ( APA ) that compares the aggregate enrichment of our peak set in these low - resolution maps to the enrichment seen when our peak set is translated in any direction ( Experimental Procedures ) . APA showed strong consistency between our loop calls and all six previously published Hi - C experiments in lymphoblastoid cell lines ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ; Kalhor et al . , 2012 ) ( Fig - ure 3D ; Data S2 , I . E ; Table S6 ) . Finally , we demonstrated that the peaks observed were robust to particular protocol conditions by performing APA on our GM12878 dilution Hi - C map and on our 112 supplemental Hi - C experiments exploring a wide range of protocol variants . Enrich - ment was seen in every experiment . Notably , these include ﬁve experiments ( HIC043 - HIC047 ; Table S1 ) in which the Hi - C proto - col was performed without crosslinking , demonstrating that the peaks observed in our experiments cannot be byproducts of the formaldehyde - crosslinking procedure . Conservation of Peaks among Human Cell Lines and across Evolution We also identiﬁed peaks in the other seven human cell lines ( Table S1 ) . Because these maps contain fewer contacts , sensi - tivity is reduced , and fewer peaks are observed ( ranging from 2 , 634 to 8 , 040 ) . APA conﬁrmed that these peak calls were consistent with the dilution Hi - C maps reported here ( in IMR90 , HMEC , HUVEC , and NHEK ) , as well as with all previously pub - lished Hi - C maps in these cell types ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ; Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Jin et al . , 2013 ) ( Data S2 , I . F ) . We found that peaks were often conserved across cell types ( Figure 4A ) : between 55 % and 75 % of the peaks found in any given cell type were also found in GM12878 ( Figure S5D ) . Next , we compared peaks across species . In CH12 - LX mouse B - lymphoblasts , we identiﬁed 2 , 927 high - conﬁdence contact domains and 3 , 331 peaks . When we examined orthologous re - gions in GM12878 , we found that 50 % of peaks and 45 % of do - mains called in mouse were also called in humans . This suggests substantial conservation of 3D genome structure across the mammals ( Figures 4B – 4E ) . Loops Anchored at a Promoter Are Associated with Enhancers and Increased Gene Activation Various lines of evidence indicate that many of the observed loops are associated with gene regulation . First , our peaks frequently have a known promoter at one peak locus ( as annotated by ENCODE’s ChromHMM ) ( Hoffman et al . , 2013 ) and a known enhancer at the other ( Figure 5A ) . For instance , 2 , 854 of the 9 , 448 peaks in our GM12878 map bring together known promoters and known enhancers ( 30 % versus 7 % expected by chance ) . The peaks include classic promoter - enhancer loops , such as at MYC ( chr8 : 128 . 35 – 128 . 75 Mb , in HMEC ) and alpha - globin ( chr16 : 0 . 15 – 0 . 22 Mb , in K562 ) . Second , genes whose promoters are associated with a loop are much more highly expressed than genes whose promoters are not associated with a loop ( 6 - fold ) . Third , the presence of cell type - speciﬁc peaks is associated with changes in expression . When we examined RNA se - quencing ( RNA - seq ) data produced by ENCODE , we found ( D ) APAplotshowstheaggregatesignalfromthe9 , 448GM12878loopswereportbysummingsubmatricessurroundingeachpeakinalow - resolutionGM12878 Hi - CmapduetoKalhoretal .

See also Figure S5 , Data S1 , V . and Data S2 , I , and Tables S4 , S5 , and S6 . Cell 159 , 1665 – 1680 , December 18 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 1671 that the appearance of a loop in a cell type was frequently accompanied by the activation of a gene whose promoter over - lapped one of the peak loci . For example , a cell - type - speciﬁc loop is anchored at the promoter of the gene encoding L - selectin ( SELL ) , which is expressed in GM12878 ( where the loop is pre - sent ) , but not in IMR90 ( where the loop is absent , Figure 5B ) . Genome - wide , we observed 557 loops in GM12878 that were clearly absent in IMR90 . The corresponding peak loci overlap - ped the promoters of 43 genes that were markedly upregulated ( > 50 - fold ) in GM12878 , but of only one gene that was markedly upregulated in IMR90 . Conversely , we found 510 loops in IMR90 that were clearly absent in GM12878 . The corresponding peak loci overlapped the promoters of 94 genes that were mark - edly upregulated in IMR90 , but of only three genes that were markedly upregulated in GM12878 . When we compared GM12878 to the ﬁve other human cell types for which ENCODE RNA - seq data were available , the results were very similar ( Figure 5C ; Table S7 ) . Occasionally , gene activation is accompanied by the emer - gence of a cell - type - speciﬁc network of peaks . Figure 5D illus - trates the case of ADAMTS1 , which encodes a protein involved in ﬁbroblast migration . The gene is expressed in IMR90 , where its promoter is involved in six loops . In GM12878 , it is not ex - pressed , and the promoter is involved in only two loops . Many of the IMR90 peak loci form transitive peaks with one another ( see discussion of ‘‘transitivity’’ below ) , suggesting that the ADAMTS1 promoter and the six distal sites may all be located at a single spatial hub .

These observations are consistent with the classic model in which looping between a promoter and enhancer activates a target gene ( Tolhuis et al . , 2002 ; Amano et al . , 2009 ; Ahmadiyeh et al . , 2010 ) . Loops Frequently Demarcate the Boundaries of Contact Domains A large fraction ofpeaks ( 38 % ) coincide withthecorners ofa con - tact domain—that is , the peak loci are located at domain bound - aries ( Figures 6A and S6 ) . Conversely , a large fraction of domains ( 39 % ) had peaks in their corner . Moreover , the appearance of a loop is usually ( in 65 % of cases ) associated with the appearance of a domain demarcated by the loop . Because this conﬁguration is so common , we use the term ‘‘loop domain’’ to refer to contact domains whose endpoints form a chromatin loop . In some cases , adjacent loop domains ( bounded by peak loci L1 - L2 and L2 - L3 , respectively ) exhibit transitivity—that is , L1 and L3 also correspond to a peak . This may indicate that the three loci simultaneously colocate at a single spatial position . Howev - er , many peaks do not exhibit transitivity , suggesting that the corresponding loci do not colocate . Figure 6B shows a region on chromosome 4 exhibiting both conﬁgurations . We also found that overlapping loops are strongly disfavored : pairs of loops L1 - L3 and L2 - L4 ( where L1 , L2 , L3 and L4 occur consecutively in the genome ) are found 4 - fold less often than expected under a random model ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . The Vast Majority of Loops Are Associated with Pairs of CTCF Motifs in a Convergent Orientation We next wondered whether peaks are associated with speciﬁc proteins . We examined the results of 86 chromatin immuno - precipitation sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) experiments performed by ENCODE in GM12878 .

( legend continued on next page ) 1674 Cell 159 , 1665 – 1680 , December 18 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . loci are bound by the insulator protein CTCF ( 86 % ) and the co - hesin subunits RAD21 ( 86 % ) and SMC3 ( 87 % ) ( Figure 6C ) . This is consistent with numerous reports , using a variety of experimental modalities , that suggest a role for CTCF and cohe - sin in mediating DNA loops ( Splinter et al . , 2006 ; Hou et al . , 2008 ; Phillips and Corces , 2009 ) . Because many of our loops demar - cate domains , this observation is also consistent with studies suggesting that CTCF delimits structural and regulatory domains ( Xie et al . , 2007 ; Cuddapah et al . , 2009 ; Dixon et al . , 2012 ) . We found that most peak loci encompass a unique DNA site containing a CTCF - binding motif , to which all three proteins ( CTCF , SMC3 , and RAD21 ) were bound ( 5 - fold enrichment ) . We were thus able to associate most of the peak loci ( 6 , 991 of 12 , 903 , or 54 % ) with a speciﬁc CTCF - motif ‘‘anchor . ’’ The consensus DNA sequence for CTCF - binding sites is typi - cally written as 5 0 - CCACNAGGTGGCAG - 3 0 . Because the se - quence is not palindromic , each CTCF motif has an orientation ; we designate the consensus motif above as the ‘‘forward’’ orien - tation . Thus , a pair of CTCF sites on the same chromosome can have four possible orientations : ( 1 ) same direction on one strand , ( 2 ) same direction on the other strand , ( 3 ) convergent on oppo - site strands , and ( 4 ) divergent on opposite strands . If CTCF sites were randomly oriented , one would expect all four orientations to occur equally often . But when we examined the 4 , 322 peaks in GM12878 where the two corresponding peak loci each contained a single CTCF - binding motif , we found that the vast majority ( 92 % ) of motif pairs are convergent ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Overall , the presence , at pairs of peak loci , of bound CTCF sites in the convergent orientation was enriched 102 - fold over random expectation ( Extended Experimental Proce - dures ) . The convergent orientation was overwhelmingly more frequent than the divergent orientation , despite the fact that divergent motifs also lie on opposing strands : in GM12878 , the counts were 3 , 971 - 78 ( 51 - fold enrichment , convergent versus divergent ) ; in IMR90 , 1 , 456 - 5 ( 291 - fold ) ; in HMEC , 968 - 11 ( 88 - fold ) ; in K562 , 723 - 2 ( 362 - fold ) ; in HUVEC , 671 - 4 ( 168 - fold ) ; in HeLa , 301 - 3 ( 100 - fold ) ; in NHEK , 556 - 9 ( 62 - fold ) ; and in CH12 - LX , 625 - 8 ( 78 - fold ) . This pattern suggests that a pair of CTCF sites in the convergent orientation is required for the formation of a loop . The observation that looped CTCF sites occur in the conver - gent orientation also allows us to analyze peak loci containing multiple CTCF - bound motifs to predict which motif instance plays a role in a given loop . In this way , we can associate nearly two - thirds of peak loci ( 8 , 175 of 12 , 903 , or 63 . 4 % ) with a single CTCF - binding motif . The speciﬁc orientation of CTCF sites at observed peaks pro - vides evidence that our peak calls are biologically correct . Because randomly chosen CTCF pairs would exhibit each of the four orientations with equal probability , the near - perfect as - sociation between our loop calls and the convergent orientation could not occur by chance ( p < 10 (cid:3) 1 , 900 , binomial distribution ) . In addition , the presence of CTCF and RAD21 sites at many of our peaks provides an opportunity to compare our results to three recent ChIA - PET experiments reported by the ENCODE Consortium ( in GM12878 and K562 ) in which ligation junctions bound to CTCF ( or RAD21 ) were isolated and analyzed . We found strong concordance with our results in all three cases ( Li et al . , 2012 ; Heidari et al . , 2014 ) ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . The CTCF - Binding Exapted SINEB2 Repeat in Mouse Shows Preferential Orientation with Respect to Loops In mouse , we found that 7 % of peak anchors lie within SINEB2 repeat elements containing a CTCF motif , which has been exap - ted to be functional . ( The spread of CTCF binding via retrotrans - position of this element , which contains a CTCF motif in its consensus sequence , has been documented in prior studies [ Bourque et al . , 2008 ; Schmidt et al . , 2012 ] . ) The CTCF motifs at peak anchors in SINEB2 elements show the same strong bias toward convergent orientation seen throughout the genome ( 89 % are oriented toward the opposing loop anchor versus 94 % genome - wide ) . The orientation of these CTCF motifs is aligned with the orientation of the SINEB2 consensus sequence in 97 % of cases . This suggests that exaptation of a CTCF in a SINEB2 element is more likely when the orientation of the in - serted SINEB2 is compatible with local loop structure . Diploid Hi - C Maps Reveal Homolog - Speciﬁc Features , Including Imprinting - Speciﬁc Loops and Massive Domains and Loops on the Inactive X Chromosome Because many of our reads overlap SNPs , it is possible to use GM12878 phasing data ( McKenna et al . , 2010 ; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al . , 2012 ) to assign contacts to speciﬁc chromosomal homologs ( Figure 7A ; Table S8 ) . Using these as - signments , we constructed a ‘‘diploid’’ Hi - C map of GM12878 comprising both maternal ( 238 M contacts ) and paternal ( 240 M ) maps . For autosomes , the maternal and paternal homologs exhibit very similar inter - and intrachromosomal contact proﬁles ( Pear - son’s R > 0 . 998 ) . One interchromosomal difference was notable : anelevatedcontactfrequencybetweenthepaternalhomologsof chromosome 6 and 11 that is consistent with an unbalanced translocation fusing chr11q : 73 . 5 Mb and all distal loci ( a stretch of over 60 Mb ) to the telomere of chromosome 6p ( Figures 7B and S7B ) . The signal intensity suggests that the translocation is present in between 1 . 2 % and 5 . 6 % of our cells ( Extended Experimental Procedures ) . We tested this prediction by karyo - typing 100 GM12878 cells using Giemsa staining and found three abnormal chromosomes , each showing the predicted ( E ) Apeakonchromosome1andcorrespondingChIP - seqtracks .

( C ) Top : in our unphased Hi - C map of GM12878 , we observe two loops joining both the promoter of thematernally - expressed H19 and thepromoterof the paternally - expressed Igf2 to a distal locus , HIDAD . Using diploid Hi - C maps , we phase these loops : the HIDAD - H19 loop is present only on the maternal homolog ( left ) and the HIDAD - Igf2 loop is present only on the paternal homolog ( right ) . ( D ) The inactive ( paternal ) copy of chromosome X ( bottom ) is partitioned into two massive ‘‘super - domains’’ not seen in the active ( maternal ) copy ( top ) . DXZ4 lies at the boundary . Contact matrices are shown at 500 kb resolution . ( E ) The ‘‘superloop’’ between FIRRE and DXZ4 is present in the unphased GM12878 map ( top ) , in the paternal GM12878 map ( middle right ) , and in the map of the female cell line IMR90 ( bottom right ) ; itisabsentfromthematernalGM12878map ( middle left ) and the map of the male HUVEC cell line ( bottom left ) . Contact matrices are shown at 50 kb resolution . See also Figure S7 and Table S8 . of genomic imprinting . In our unphased maps , we clearly see two loops from a sin - gledistallocusat1 . 72Mb ( thatbindsCTCF in the forward orientation ) to loci located near the promoters of both H19 and Igf2 ( both of which bind CTCF in the reverse orientation , i . e . , theaboveconsensusmotif lies on the opposite strand ; see Figure 7C ) . We refer to this distal locus as the H19 / Igf2 Distal Anchor Domain ( HIDAD ) . Our diploid mapsrevealthatthelooptothe H19 region is present on the maternal chromosome ( from which H19 is expressed ) , but the loop to the Igf2 region is absent or greatly attenuated . The opposite pattern is found on the paternal chromosome ( from which Igf2 is expressed ) . Pronounced differences were seen on the diploid intrachromosomal maps of chromosome X . The paternal X chromosome , which is usually inactive in GM12878 , is partitioned into two massive domains ( 0 – 115 Mb and 115 – 155 . 3 Mb ) . These ‘‘superdomains’’ are not seen in the active , maternal X ( Figure 7D ) . When we examined the unphased maps of chromosome X for the karyotypically normal female cell lines in our study ( GM12878 , IMR90 , HMEC , 1676 Cell 159 , 1665 – 1680 , December 18 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . NHEK ) , the superdomains on X were evident , although the signal was attenuated due to the superposition of signals from active and inactive X chromosomes . When we examined the male HUVEC cell line and the haploid KBM7 cell line , we saw no evi - dence of superdomains ( Figure S7G ) . Interestingly , the boundary between the superdomains ( ChrX : 115 Mb ± 500 kb ) lies near the macrosatellite repeat DXZ4 ( ChrX : 114 , 867 , 433 – 114 , 919 , 088 ) near the middle of Xq . DXZ4 is a CpG - rich tandem repeat that is conserved across primates and monkeys and encodes a long noncoding RNA . In males and on the active X , DXZ4 is heterochromatic , hypermethylated and does not bind CTCF . On the inactiveX , DXZ4 is euchromatic , hypomethylated , and binds CTCF . DXZ4 has been hypothesized to play a role in reorganizing chromatin during X inactivation ( Chadwick , 2008 ) . There were also signiﬁcant differences in loop structure be - tween the chromosome X homologs . We observed 27 large ‘‘superloops , ’’ each spanning between 7 and 74 Mb , present only on the inactive X chromosome in the diploid map ( Figure 7E ) . The superloops were also seen in all four unphased maps from karyotypically normal XX cells , but were absent in unphased maps from X0 and XY cells ( Figure S7I ) . Two of the superloops ( chrX : 56 . 8 Mb - DXZ4 and DXZ4 - 130 . 9 Mb ) were reported previ - ously in a locus - speciﬁc study ( Horakova et al . , 2012 ) . Like the peak loci of most other loops , nearly all the superloop anchors bind CTCF ( 23 of 24 ) . The six anchor regions most frequently associated with superloops are large ( up to 200 kb ) . Four of these anchor regions contain whole long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA ) genes : loc550643 , XIST , DXZ4 , and FIRRE . Three ( loc550643 , DXZ4 , and FIRRE ) contain CTCF - binding tandem re - peats that only bind CTCF on the inactive homolog . DISCUSSION Using the in situ Hi - C protocol , we probed genomic architecture with high resolution ; in the case of GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells , better than 1 kb . We observe the presence of contact do - mains that were too small ( median length = 185 kb ) to be seen in previous maps . Loci within a domain interact frequently with one another , have similar patterns of chromatin modiﬁcations , and exhibit similar long - range contact patterns . Domains tend to be conserved across cell types and between human and mouse . When the pattern of chromatin modiﬁcations associated with a domain changes , the domain’s long - range contact pattern also changes . Domains exhibit at least six distinct patterns of long - range contacts ( subcompartments ) , which subdivide the two compartments that we previously reported based on low resolu - tion data . The subcompartments are each associated with distinct chromatin patterns . It is possible that the chromatin pat - terns play a role in bringing about the long - range contact pat - terns , or vice versa . Our data also make it possible to create a genome - wide cata - log of chromatin loops . We identiﬁed loops by looking for pairs of loci that have signiﬁcantly more contacts with one another than they do with other nearby loci . In our densest map ( GM12878 ) , we observe 9 , 448 loops . The loops reported here have many interesting properties . Most loops are short ( < 2 Mb ) and strongly conserved across cell types and between human and mouse . Promoter - enhancer loops are common and associated with gene activation . Loops tend not to overlap ; they often demarcate contact domains , and may establish them . CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 associate with loops ; each of these proteins is found at over 86 % of loop anchors . The most striking property of loops is that the pair of CTCF mo - tifs present at the loop anchors occurs in a convergent orienta - tion in > 90 % of cases ( versus 25 % expected by chance ) . The importance of motif orientation between loci that are separated by , on average , 360 kb is surprising and must bear on the mech - anism by which CTCF and cohesin form loops , which seems likely to involve CTCF dimerization . Experiments in which the presence or orientation of CTCF sites is altered may enable the engineering of loops , domains , and other chromatin structures . It is interestingto compareour results to those seenin previous reports . Thecontactdomains we observe are similar in sizeto the ‘‘physical domains’’ that have been reported in Hi - C maps of Drosophila ( Sexton et al . , 2012 ) and to the ‘‘topologically con - strained domains’’ ( mean length : 220 kb ) whose existence was demonstrated in the 1970s and 1980s in structural studies of hu - man chromatin ( Cook and Brazell , 1975 ; Vogelstein et al . , 1980 ; Zehnbauer and Vogelstein , 1985 ) . On the other hand , the do - mains we observe are much smaller than the TADs ( 1 Mb ) ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) that have been reported in humans and mice on the basis of lower - resolution contact maps . This is because detect - ing TADs involves detection of domain boundaries . With higher resolution data , it is possible to detect additional boundaries beyond those seen in previous maps . Interestingly , nearly all the boundaries we observe are associated with either a subcom - partment transition ( that occur approximately every 300 kb ) , or a loop ( that occur approximately every 200 kb ) ; and many are associated with both . Our annotation identiﬁes many fewer loops than were reported in several recent high - throughput studies , despite the fact that we have more data . The key reason is that we call peaks only when a pair of loci shows elevated contact frequency relative to the local background—that is , when the peak pixel is enriched as compared to other pixels in its neighborhood . In contrast , prior studies have deﬁned peaks by comparing the contact fre - quency at a pixel to the genome - wide average ( Sanyal et al . , 2012 ; Jin et al . , 2013 ) . This latter deﬁnition is problematic because many pixels within a domain can be annotated as peaks despite showing no local increase in contact frequency . Papers using the latter deﬁnition imply the existence of more than 100 , 000 loops ( 1 , 187 loops were reported in 1 % of the genome [ Sanyal et al . , 2012 ] ) or even more than 1 million loops ( reported in a genome - wide Hi - C study [ Jin et al . , 2013 ] ) . The vast majority of the loops annotated by these papers show no enrichment rela - tive to the local background when examined one - by - one and no enrichment with respect to any published Hi - C data set when analyzed using APA ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ; Figure S8 ; Data S2 ) . This suggests that these peak annotations may correspond to pairs of loci that lie in the same domain or compartment , but rarely correspond to loops . We created diploid Hi - C maps by using polymorphisms to assign contacts to distinct chromosomal homologs . We found that the inactive X chromosome is partitioned into two large Cell 159 , 1665 – 1680 , December 18 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 1677 superdomains whose boundary lies near the locus of the lncRNA DXZ4 . We also detect a network of long - range superloops , the strongest of which are anchored at locations containing lncRNA genes ( loc550643 , XIST , DXZ4 , and FIRRE ) . With the exception of XIST , all of these lncRNAs contain CTCF - binding tandem re - peats that bind CTCF only on the inactive X . In our original report on Hi - C , we observed that Hi - C maps can be used to study physical models of genome folding , and we proposed a fractal globule model for genome folding at the meg - abase scale . The kilobase - scale maps reported here allow the physical properties of genome folding to be probed at much higher resolution . We will report such studies elsewhere . JustasloopsbringdistantDNA lociintoclose spatialproximity , we ﬁnd that they bring disparate aspects of DNA biology—do - mains , compartments , chromatin marks , and genetic regula - tion—into close conceptual proximity . As our understanding of the physical connections between DNA loci continues to improve , our understanding of the relationships between these broader phenomena will deepen . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES In Situ Hi - C Protocol All cell lines were cultured following the manufacturer’s recommendations . Two to ﬁve million cells were crosslinked with 1 % formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . Nuclei were permeabilized . DNA was digested with 100 units of MboI , and the ends of restriction fragments were labeled using biotinylated nucleotides and ligated in a small volume . After reversal of cross - links , ligated DNA was puriﬁed and sheared to a length of (cid:1) 400 bp , at which point ligation junctions werepulled downwithstreptavidin beadsand prepped for Illumina sequencing . Dilution Hi - C was performed as in Lieberman - Aiden et al . ( 2009 ) . 3D - FISH 3D DNA - FISH was performed as in Beliveau et al . ( 2012 ) with minor modiﬁcations . Hi - C Data Pipeline All sequence data were produced using Illumina paired - end sequencing . We processeddatausingacustompipelinethatwasoptimizedforparallelcompu - tation on a cluster . The pipeline uses BWA ( Li and Durbin , 2010 ) to map each readendseparatelytotheb37ormm9referencegenomes ; removesduplicate and near - duplicate reads ; removes reads that map to the same fragment ; and ﬁlters the remaining reads based on mapping quality score . Contact matrices were generated at base pair delimited resolutions of 2 . 5 Mb , 1 Mb , 500 kb , 250 kb , 100 kb , 50 kb , 25 kb , 10 kb , and 5 kb , as well as fragment - de - limitedresolutionsof500f , 200f , 100f , 50f , 20f , 5f , 2f , and1f . Forourlargest maps , we also generated a 1 kb contact matrix . Normalized contact matrices are produced at all resolutions using Knight and Ruiz ( 2012 ) . Annotation of Domains : Arrowhead To annotate domains , we apply an ‘‘arrowhead’’ transformation , deﬁned as A i , i + d = ( M * i , i - d – M * i , i + d ) / ( M * i , i (cid:3) d + M * i , i + d ) . M * denotes the normalized contact matrix ( see Figures S2A – S2F ) . This is equivalent to calculating a matrix equal to (cid:3) 1 * ( observed / expected (cid:3) 1 ) , where the expected model controls for local background and distance from the diagonal in the simplest possible way : the ‘‘expected’’ value at i , i + d is simply the mean of the observed values at i , i (cid:3) d and i , i + d . A i , i + d will be strongly positive if locus i (cid:3) d is inside a domain and locus i + d is not . If the reverse is true , A i , i + d will be strongly negative . If the lociarebothinsideorbothoutsideadomain , A i , i + d willbeclosetozero . Conse - quently , if there is a domain at [ a , b ] , we ﬁnd that A takes on very negative values inside a triangle whose vertices lie at [ a , a ] , [ a , b ] , and [ ( a + b ) / 2 , b ] and very positive values inside a triangle whose vertices lie at [ ( a + b ) / 2 , b ] , [ b , b ] , and [ b , 2 b (cid:3) a ] . The size and positioning of these triangles creates the arrow - head - shaped feature that replaces each domain in M * . A ‘‘corner score’’ matrix , indicating each pixel’s likelihood of lying at the corner of a domain , is efﬁciently calculated from the arrowhead matrix using dynamic programming . Assigning Loci to Subcompartments Toclusterlocibased onlong - rangecontactpatterns , weconstructeda100kb resolution interchromosomal contact matrix such that loci from odd chromo - somes appeared on the rows , and loci from even chromosomes appeared on the columns . ( Intrachromosomal data and data involving chromosome X were excluded . ) We cluster this matrix using the Python package scikit . For subcompartment B4 , the 100 kb interchromosomal matrix for chromosome 19 was constructed and clustered separately , using the same procedure . Annotation of Peaks : HiCCUPS Our peak - calling algorithm examines each pixel in a Hi - C contact matrix and compares the number of contacts in the pixel to the number of contacts in a series of regions surrounding the pixel . The algorithm thus identiﬁes ‘‘enriched pixels’’ M * i , j where the contact frequency is higher than expected and where this enrichment is not the result of a larger structural feature . For instance , we rule out the possibility that the enrichment of pixel M * i , j is the result of L i and L j lying in the same domain by comparing the pixel’s contact count to an expected model derived by examining the ‘‘lower - left’’ neighborhood . ( The ‘‘lower - left’’ neighborhood samples pixels M i 0 , j 0 where i % i 0 % j 0 % j ; if a pixel is in a domain , these pixels will necessarily be in the same domain . ) We requirethat thepixelbeingtestedcontainat least50 % morecontacts thanex - pected based on the lower - left neighborhood and the enrichment be statisti - callysigniﬁcantaftercorrectingformultiplehypothesistesting ( FalseDiscovery Rate < 10 % ) . Thesamecriteriaareappliedtothreeotherneighborhoods . Thus , tobelabeledanenrichedpixel , apixelmustbesigniﬁcantlyenrichedrelativeto four neighborhoods : ( 1 ) pixels to its lower - left , ( 2 ) pixels to its left and right , ( 3 ) pixels above and below , and ( 4 ) a donut surrounding the pixel of interest ( Fig - ure 3A ) . The resulting enriched pixels tend to form contiguous interaction re - gions comprising 5 – 20 pixels each . We deﬁne the ‘‘peak pixel’’ ( or simply the ‘‘peak’’ ) to be the pixel in an interaction region with the most contacts . Because of the enormous number of pixels that must be examined , this calculation requires weeks of central processing unit ( CPU ) time to execute . ( For instance , at a matrix resolution of 5 kb , the algorithm must be run on 20 billion pixels . ) To accelerate it , we created a highly parallelized im - plementation using general - purpose graphical processing units resulting in a 200 - fold speedup . Aggregate Peak Analysis We perform APA on 10 kb resolution contact matrices . To measure the aggre - gate enrichment of a set of putative peaks in a contact matrix , we plot the sum ofaseriesofsubmatricesderived from thatcontact matrix . Each ofthesesub - matrices is a 210 kb 3 210 kb square centered at a single putative peak in the upper triangle of the contact matrix . The resulting APA plot displays the total number of contacts that lie within the entire putative peak set at the center of the matrix ; the entry immediately to the right of center corresponds to the total number of contacts in the pixel set obtained by shifting the peak set 10 kb to the right ; the entry two positions above center corresponds to an up - ward shift of 20 kb and so on . Focal enrichment across the peak set in aggre - gate manifests as larger values at the center of the APA plot . The APA plots shown only include peaks whose loci are at least 300 kb apart .
