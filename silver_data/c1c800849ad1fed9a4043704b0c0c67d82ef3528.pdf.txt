Epithelial morphogenesis during development defines organ architecture by forming different types of tubes and glands with apical lumens . These apical compartments can form via multiple mechanisms [ 1 , 2 ] . Cavitation involves clearance of selected cells in a cell cluster by means of apoptosis although other mechanisms such as autophagy may play an additional role [ 3 – 5 ] . Loss of matrix anchorage ( anoikis ) is thought to be the main trigger but secreted death factors may also contribute to lumenal cell death [ 6 ] . Hollowing of individual cells ( cell hollowing ) or clusters of cells ( cord hollowing ) is driven by polarized membrane trafficking machinery and orientation of cellular cytoskeleton according to extracellular cues [ 1 , 2 , 7 ] . Cues from the extracellular microenvi - ronment not only direct the positioning of the forming apical lumen but also govern the mechanism by which it is formed [ 5 , 8 , 9 ] . b 1 - integrins , which function as ab - heterodimers , are important ECM - receptors implicated in conveying the polarity cues from the ECM [ 9 ] . However , the contributions of specific integrin heterodimers in these processes have not been addressed in detail . In this study we have analyzed the specific roles of different integrin heterodimers in the formation of apical membrane using 3D cultures of Madin Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells . It was found that two distinct integrin - dependent pathways regulate epithelial cystogenesis . Whereas a 2 b 1 - and a 6 b 4 - integrins were required for apical lumen formation in collagen gels , a 3 b 1 - integrin function was critical in BM - extract ( BME ) gels . Importantly , despite being mechanistically distinct , these integrin - dependent pathways were found to complement each other functionally to ensure efficient cystogenesis under different ECM environments . Results Characterization of the adhesive properties of integrin - KD MDCK cells The expression profile of different integrins in MDCK cells was studied using a quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analysis that revealed abundant expression of several integrin chains , including b 1 - , b 3 - , b 4 - , b 5 - b 6 - , b 8 , a 2 - , a 3 - , a 6 - and a V - subunits ( Figure S1A ) . Integrin mRNA expression levels were determined in three different culture conditions used in this study ; 1 ) subconfluent on tissue culture plastic , 2 ) cells grown for 6 days in 3D collagen I gels PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19453 and 3 ) 3D cultures in BME gels grown for 3 days . Notable reduction in mRNA levels was observed for b 1 - and a 2 - subunits seeded into BME gels and for a 6 - and b 1 - subunits embedded into collagen when compared with 2D cultures indicating that cellular microenvironment controls integrin expression . To address the functional roles of the most abundant laminin - ( a 3 b 1 , a 6 b 1 , a 6 b 4 ) and collagen - binding ( a 2 b 1 ) integrins we generated retroviral shRNA - knockdown ( KD ) constructs targeting a 2 - , a 3 - , a 6 - , b 1 and b 4 - subunits . Efficient depletion of the specific target mRNAs was confirmed by qPCR ( Table S1 ) . Down - regulation of protein levels was demonstrated either by western blotting or by immunofluorescence ( Figure S1B ) . Adhesive properties of the integrin - KD ( Itg - KD ) MDCK cells were characterized by employing a standard adhesion assay on selected substrates . Itg b 1 - KD cells lacking functional b 1 - integrin heterodimers showed marked adhesion defects on all substrates ( Figure 1A ) . Inhibition of the Itg b 4 - or individual Itg a - subunits revealed more modest and / or specific defects . All of these KDs slightly reduced adhesion on LN - 511 agreeing with the reported redundancy between different laminin - receptors in MDCK cells [ 10 ] . Depletion of Itg a 2 - subunit , component of the collagen receptor a 2 b 1 , had prominent effects on adhesion to collagens and BME , suggesting that adhesion to laminin - rich BME was mainly mediated via a 2 b 1 - integrin / collagen IV interactions . Depletion of a 6 - or b 4 - subunits of the a 6 b 4 - integrins diminished adhesion to BME and collagen IV to some extent . Itga3 - KD cells had a tendency to adhere better on collagens and BME , which may reflect its proposed role as a negative regulator of other integrins [ 11 ] . However , these positive effects observed in Itg a 3 - KD cells were not statistically significant . To analyze the specific integrin - ECM interactions in more detail , we studied cell spreading by seeding Itg - KD cells on collagen I or laminin - 511 coated surfaces and compared average cell areas ( Figure 1B and C ) . Itg b 1 - and Itg a 2 - KD cells spread poorly on collagen I indicating that a 2 b 1 - integrin is crucial not only for adhesion but also for cytoskeletal reorganization upon binding to collagen . Whereas individual Itg a - subunits did not markedly reduce adhesion to LN - 511 , Itg a 3 - and b 1 - subunits were required for efficient cell spreading on laminin . Curiously , whereas Itg a 6 - KD cells displayed no spreading defects , depletion of the b 4 - subunit inhibited spreading on LN - 511 . Why depletion of a 6 - or b 4 - integrins led to differing phenotypes is not clear but it Figure 1 . Adhesive properties of the integrin - depleted MDCK cells . A ) Single cell suspensions of control , Itg a 3 - , Itg a 6 - , Itg a 2 - , Itg b 1 - and Itg b 4 - KD MDCK cells were allowed to settle for 90 minutes on collagen I ( COL - I ) - , basement membrane - extract ( BME ) - , laminin - 511 ( LN - 511 ) - or collagen IV ( COL - IV ) - coated tissue culture wells .

The specificities of the RNAi phenotypes were confirmed by using independent shRNA constructs ( Figure S2A and B ) . This data indicated that cytoskeletal reorganization upon binding to collagen I and LN - 511 were regulated by a 2 b 1 - and a 3 b 1 - integrins , respectively . In addition , b 4 - integrins contributed to cell spreading on LN - 511 . Integrins play distinct roles in epithelial cystogenesis To study the role of specific integrins in the biogenesis of apical lumen we embedded control cells and the different Itg - KD cells into 3D collagen I gels where parental MDCK cells form polarized epithelial cysts [ 14 ] . When cultured in collagen I gels for 10 days , the majority ( , 80 % ) of control cells formed cysts with dilated central lumens ( Figure 2A ) . Cysts with smooth - surfaced circular lumen ( s ) stained with apical marker podocalyxin ( Podxl ) , whose subcellular localization is known to be restricted to free surfaces [ 15 ] , were classified as normal ( arrows in Figure 2Aa and Ag ) . Unlike the control cysts , the majority of Itg b 1 - and Itg a 2 - KD cysts lacked big central lumens and instead grew as poorly organized clusters of cells with uneven basal surface ( Figure 2Ad , Ae , and Ak ) . Approximately half of the abnormal Itg a 2 - KD cysts contained small lumens that accumulated apical markers indicat - ing some degree of cell polarity ( arrow in Figure 2Aj ) . However , many Itg a 2 - KD and most Itg b 1 - KD cysts appeared unpolarized and mistargeted apical pole marker Podxl to the basal plasma membrane facing the ECM ( arrows in Figure 2Ad and Ae ) . This finding is in line with an earlier report where a function - blocking antibody against integrin a 2 - subunit inhibited tubulocyst forma - tion upon collagen overlay [ 16 ] . Similar to spreading data , Itg b 4 - and Itg a 6 - KD cells behaved differently as the former showed a phenotype similar to Itg a 2 - and Itg b 1 - KD cells ( Figure 2Af and Figure 2 . Epithelial cystogenesis in collagen requires a 2 b 1 - and b 4 - integrins but depends on a 3 b 1 - integrin in BME gels . A ) Control , Itg a 3 - , Itg a 6 - , Itg a 2 - , Itg b 1 - and Itg b 4 - KD MDCK cells were grown in 3D collagen I matrix for 10 days ( Upper panels , COL - I ) or in 3D BME gel for 7 days ( lower panel , BME ) . Cysts were fixed and stained for DNA ( DAPI , blue ) , filamentous actin ( red ) and an apical marker podocalyxin ( green ) . Cysts were phenotypically classified as normal when they had 1 – 2 central main apical lumen ( s ) with smooth contour . Cysts with poorly organized lumens , multiple small lumens or with no lumen were scored as abnormal . B ) Quantitation of the cyst phenotypes in collagen I and BME .

Data shows averages + SD from two independent experiments with duplicate samples . A minimum of 100 cysts were analyzed per sample . Size bars are 30 m m . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0019453 . g002 Integrins Regulate Epithelial Cystogenesis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19453 Al ) . Itg a 6 - KD cells , on the other hand , formed polarized cysts with essentially normal morphology . Itg a 3 - KD cysts contained central lumens and were properly polarized although it was noted that Itg a 3 - KD cells had a slightly elevated susceptibility to apoptosis and grew more slowly than controls upon seeding to collagen gels . Also 2D cultures of Itg a 3 - KD cells were found to proliferate with slower kinetics and to contain apoptotic cells more frequently than the controls ( data not shown ) . Mostov and coworkers demonstrated that addition of exogenous laminin at least partially bypasses the requirement of b 1 - integrin activation for cystogenesis [ 8 ] . To examine if exogenous laminin can revert the observed cystogenesis phenotypes , all the integrin - KD MDCK cells were embedded into 3D BME - gels rich in laminin . Whereas the cystogenesis defects of Itg a 2 - and Itg b 4 - KD cells appeared to be completely rescued , Itg b 1 - KD cysts were still grossly abnormal and contained either no lumen or many small lumens ( Figure 2Aq ) . In both cases , however , Podxl staining disappeared from the basal membrane ( compare Figures 2Ae and 2Aq ) . Given the laminin spreading and collagen cystogenesis phenotypes of Itg b 1 - and Itg b 4 - KD cells we next addressed the possibility that b 4 - integrin may partially rescue the polarity by conveying the basal signal in BME environment where high concentration of laminin is provided basally . To this end , we studied the localization of Podxl in control and Itg b 4 - KD cells in BME gels treated or not with b 1 - function - blocking antibody ( AIIB2 ) . Whereas b 1 - blocking antibody - treatment in control cells resulted in multiple lumen phenotype similar to Itg b 1 - KD cells , combining AIIB2 - treatment with Itg b 4 - KD led to a severe polarity defect similar to Itg b 1 - depleted cells in collagen ( Figure 2C ) . Apical markers were retained basally in Itg b 4 - KD / Itg b 1 - inhibited cells suggesting that b 4 - integrins can mediate a basal cue in Itg b 1 - depleted cysts in BME gels . Interestingly , significant number of Itg a 3 - KD cysts , which were seemingly normal in collagen gels , failed to form a central lumen and instead displayed multiple small rudimentary lumens ( white arrow in Figure 2An ) . When compared with cells in the Itg b 1 - KD cysts , individual Itg a 3 - KD cells had more cuboidal morphology and were seemingly polarized and connected to small apical compartments in the cysts . However , the overall cellular organization was abnormal . While a single layer of cells surrounded the lumens in control cysts , Itg a 3 - KD cysts frequently contained multiple cell layers ( yellow arrow in Figure 2An ) . Itg a 6 - KD cells showed no overt cystogenesis phenotype in BME - gels . Experiments with alternative shRNA constructs yielded similar results ( Figure S2C and D ) . These experiments suggest that different integrin - mediated cascades orchestrate efficient cystogen - esis , a 2 b 1 - and a 6 b 4 - integrins seem to regulate establishment of apico - basal polarity whereas a 3 b 1 - integrins contribute to cysto - genesis in BME environment by an unknown mechanism . a 2 b 1 - and a 3 b 1 - mediated mechanisms to form apical lumens are mechanistically distinct A recent study by Martin - Belmonte et al . reported that polarization dynamics , depending on the strength of the polarity cue and the initial size of unpolarized cell clusters , both apoptotic and non - apoptotic mechanisms contribute to cystogenesis in MDCK cells [ 5 ] . However , it remains unclear whether different molecular machineries at the cell / ECM - interface are involved in such regulation . Because Itg a 2 - KD cysts were normal in BME gels and Itg a 3 - KD cysts were normal in collagen gels it is likely that these two integrins are not in a linear pathway , but rather seem to constitute two independent or parallel mechanisms . Upon prolonged culture ( followed up to 15 days ) in BME gel it was noted that the small apical lumens in Itg a 3 - KD cysts grew in size and occasionally seemed to fuse to form a more central lumen ( Figure 3Ab and c ) . These lumens contained a significant number of small nuclei with no detectable actin staining indicating cell borders thus suggesting that these may represent apoptotic cells ( arrow in Figure 3Bb ) . In addition to nuclear morphology , apoptosis was determined by staining the cysts for cleaved caspase - 3 ( Figure 3Bc and d ) . To analyze the involvement of apoptotic cavitation in the cystogenesis in BME gels in more detail we screened for apoptotic nuclei in the different integrin - KD cysts . It was found that while the control cells typically formed lumens via non - apoptotic mechanisms , Itg a 3 - and , to lesser extent , Itg b 1 - KD cysts contained significant amount of lumenal apoptosis ( Figure 3C ) . Itg a 2 - KD cysts did not show lumenal accumulation of fragmented nuclei suggesting that lumens formed via hollowing . Both apoptotic and non - apoptotic mechanisms seemed to be inhibited in BME - embedded Itg b 1 - KD cysts in which apical lumens did not grow in size upon prolonged culture ( Figure 3Ad ) . When QVD - O - Ph , an apoptosis inhibitor , was added to cyst cultures , a robust accumulation of lumenal cells was observed in Itg a 3 - KD cysts whereas very few were seen in control or Itg a 2 - KD cysts that continued to develop normally ( Figure 3D and data not shown ) . This data indicated that non - apoptotic ( hollowing ) lumen formation is abrogated in BME gel - embedded Itg a 3 - KD cysts but lumens can still form via apoptotic cavitation . Taken together these findings suggest that although b 1 - integrins are important for efficient lumen formation under all conditions tested , a 2 b 1 - and a 3 b 1 - integrins operate in two distinct pathways . Next , we went on to characterize these affected pathways in more detail . a 2 b 1 - integrin mediated pathway is required for the establishment of a basal cue that guide apico - basal polarization b 1 - integrin - dependent assembly of laminin guides cell polari - zation in collagen - grown MDCK cysts [ 8 ] . Thus , abnormal laminin assembly may underlie the cystogenesis defect in Itg a 2 - , Itg b 1 - and Itg b 4 - KD cysts . In some cases laminin deposits were observed seemingly laterally between the cells ( see arrowheads in Figure 4B ) . However , the fact that the overall morphology of the affected Itg - KD cysts was disturbed complicates the assessment of the integrity of their BME . Because laminin was still secreted and at least to some extent assembled in a 2 b 1 - and ( a 6 ) b 4 - integrin - depleted cysts , it is possible that the seemingly abnormal BME staining in Itg a 2 - , Itg b 1 - ( Figure 4B ) and Itg b 4 - KD ( data not shown ) cells merely reflect their perturbed cellular organization . On the other hand , basal staining of the free surface marker Podxl observed in these Itg - KDs ( Figure 2A ) strongly supports a conclusion that the establishment of ECM - triggered basal cue is affected . A small GTPase Rac1 reportedly mediates this basal cue and it was reported that forced activation of Rac1 bypasses the requirement of b 1 - integrin activation [ 9 ] . We measured the steady - state levels of active Rac1 in the control and the different Itg - KD MDCK cysts . However , basal Rac1 activity was low and no Itg - subunit specific effects were seen as all the Itg - KDs tended to have slightly reduced levels of active Rac1 ( data not shown ) . To overcome this problem we first addressed the functional role of Rac1 - activation by utilizing a cell line in which expression of dominant negative Rac1 can be regulated by doxycycline ( T23 MDCK - Rac1 T17N - Tet - Off , [ 17 ] , Figure S3C ) . T23 MDCK - Rac1 T17N cells were seeded into the different 3D gels in the presence or absence of doxycycline . We could confirm the role of Rac1 as normal cysts formed in the presence of doxycycline , but induced expression of Rac T17N led to appearance of non - polarized cell clusters in both collagen I and BME environments ( Figure S3A Integrins Regulate Epithelial Cystogenesis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19453 and B ) resembling the phenotypes of Itg a 2 - , Itg b 1 - and Itg b 4 - KD cysts in collagen ( Figure 2 ) . The possibility that these cyst phenotypes resulted from impaired Rac1 - activation was further assessed by overexpressing a dominant - active GFP - tagged form of Rac1 ( GFP - Rac1 G12V ) in Itg a 2 - and Itg b 1 - KD cells grown in collagen . Constitutive Rac1 - activation smoothened the contour of basal surfaces , led to more continuous basal laminin network ( Figure 4B ) and , importantly , exclusion of an apical pole marker Podxl from the cell - matrix contact sites ( arrows in Figure 4A ) . Although the ECM - contacting cell surfaces adopted basal identity in these rescued Itg - KD cysts , apical lumens did not form properly . This is probably due to effects of aberrant Rac1 - activation on survival or motility of luminal cells as GFP - Rac1 G12V perturbed lumen biogenesis in a similar manner also in control MDCK cysts ( Figure 4A and B ) . Others have also reported similar findings on the effects of Rac1 G12V on cystogenesis [ 18 ] . Rac1 - activation plays multiple roles during epithelial morphogenesis and it is crucial for not only for the initial signal guiding basal laminin assembly in collagen gels but also for the laminin - dependent polarity cue that orients apico - basal cell polarity in BME environment . One of the well - documented consequences of Rac1 - activation is its reciprocal regulation of the RhoA / ROCK / MyosinII - pathway Figure 3 .

Indeed , recent data has implicated RhoA inhibition in the establishment of the basal cue in MDCK cysts [ 20 ] . Yu and coworkers showed that the polarity defect in cysts where integrin signaling was blocked could be rescued by inhibiting the RhoA / ROCK1 / MyosinII - pathway . To assess if the phenotype observed in our model system could be similarly rescued , we treated collagen - embedded control , Itg a 2 - and Itg b 1 - KD cysts with a ROCK - inhibitor Y27632 . Control cysts remained properly polarized in the presence of Y27632 although they often formed 2 – 3 smooth - surfaced lumens instead of one main lumen ( Figure 4C ) . Why Y27632 led to formation of multiple big lumens is unclear . Importantly , the cell polarity was rescued in most of the Y27632 - treated Itg a 2 - and Itg b 1 - KD cysts that now displayed very similar overall morphology than the ROCK - inhibitor - treated control cysts ( Figure 4C , D ) . This data suggests that the phenotype of a 2 b 1 - integrin - depleted cells is due to perturbed signaling activities of Rac1 and RhoA - GTPases . Taken together , our data strongly suggest that impaired activation of Rac1 / RhoA - mediated signaling cascade that is essential for the establishment of basal cue underlies the cystogenesis defect in a 2 b 1 - and ( a 6 ) b 4 - integrin - depleted cells . a 3 b 1 - integrins are required for proper orientation of mitotic spindles in BME gels Cdc42 , another small GTPase of the Rho - family , is an important component of the cell polarity signaling machinery Figure 4 . Defective basal cue in a 2 b 1 - integrin - depleted cysts is rescued by Rac1 activation or inhibition of RhoA .

Cell division axis in polarized epithelial cells is tightly regulated and follows a defined sequence of events in both 2D and 3D culture systems [ 22 , 23 ] . First , subapical centriole duplicates and one the centrioles migrates towards the basal side of the nucleus . Second , during early prophase the forming mitotic spindle aligns parallel to apico - basal axis but then rotates 90 u such that the metaphase spindle is perpendicular to apico - basal axis . Interestingly , inhibition of Cdc42 function in epithelial 3D cultures leads to very similar multilumen phenotype as was observed here for Itg a 3 - KD cells [ 24 , 25 ] . Hall and coworkers provided evidence that the multilu - men phenotype in Cdc42 - depleted cysts is due to misaligned spindles in dividing cells of the growing cysts [ 23 , 25 ] . To characterize the observed multilumen phenotype of Itg a 3 - KD cells in BME gels in more detail , control , Itg a 3 - , Itg a 2 - and Itg b 1 - KD cysts were grown for 4 days after which dividing cells were visualized by staining nuclei and actin . The angles of division in relation to the center of mass of the forming cysts were determined . To avoid possible error resulting from rotating metaphase plates , only post - metaphase cells ( including mitotic cells between anaphase to late telophase / cytokinesis ) were analyzed in which the coordinates of the separated post - metaphase chromatids relative to cyst center could be determined . The majority of the dividing cells in control and Itg a 2 - KD cysts divided perpendicular to the forming apico - basal axis ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , many Itg a 3 - KD and Itg b 1 - KD cells divided at sharper angles relative to cyst center . The distribution of the angles of mitotic divisions in Itg a 3 - and Itg b 1 - KD cysts was significantly broader than in controls suggesting that defective orientation of mitotic spindles could underlie the observed multilumen pheno - types ( Figure 5B ) . Again the fact that Itg a 3 - KD cysts were in general less well organized than controls complicated the assessment how much the observed difference in the cell division axes contributes to the lumen formation . To follow cell divisions in the developing cysts in a more dynamic fashion , we set up a time - lapse assay . For this purpose we generated MDCK cells stably expressing mouse E - cadherin fused to GFP ( ECad - GFP ) . The majority of Ecad - GFP - expressing cells formed polarized cysts with prominent lumens confirming that cystogenesis was not perturbed by the ectopically expressed Ecad - GFP or the imaging conditions used ( data not shown ) . Importantly , after reaching a certain cluster size , cells in control cysts almost invariably seemed to divide in the plane of the epithelial monolayer surrounding the forming lumen ( Figure S4A and movie S1 ) . On the contrary , in Itg a 3 - KD cysts cell division axes had variable orientations and were difficult to determine even at later stages of cystogenesis ( Figure S4B and movie S2 ) . Given the central role of Cdc42 in the epithelial hollowing and the similarity of the Itg a 3 - KD cystogenesis phenotype with that reported for Cdc42 - depleted cells we next addressed the possible involvement Cdc42 regulation in the different integrin - depleted MDCK cells . Cells were grown on top of BME gels and allowed to reach confluency prior to determination of Cdc42 activity . The steady state activity of Cdc42 was relatively low in all of the cell lines studied but Itg a 3 - KD cells displayed a modest two - fold increase suggesting that a 3 b 1 - integrin might contribute to negative regulation of Cdc42 ( Figure 6B ) . The possible role of Cdc42 as a downstream effector in the a 3 b 1 - integrin - mediated pathway was further investigated by expressing a GFP - tagged dominant - active mutant of Cdc42 ( GFP - Cdc42 Q61L ) in the control , Itg a 2 - and Itg a 3 - KD cells . Overexpression of GFP - Cdc42 Q61L elongated the lateral membrane domains resulting in columnar morphology in all cell types ( Figure 6A ) . Whereas Cdc42 activation had no significant effects on the morphology of Itg a 3 - KD cysts which still contained either no or small lumens , it did perturb the cystogenesis of control and Itg a 2 - KD cells which often contained multiple cell layers and lumenal cell populations thereby resembling the phenotype of Itg a 3 - KD cysts ( white arrows in Figure 6A ) . Interestingly , whereas in control and in Itg a 2 - KD cells GFP - Cdc42 Q61L localized mainly to lateral and apical membranes , basal accumulation of Cdc42 was observed in many Itg a 3 - KD cysts ( Figure 6A , yellow arrow ) . This signal coincided with robust basal actin - staining typical for Itg a 3 - KD cysts thus raising the possibility that abnormal recruitment and / or activation of Cdc42 at the basal surface could be the underlying cause of the basal actin accumulation observed especially in cysts grown from selected Itg a 3 - KD cell clones with efficient silencing of Itg a 3 mRNA . Although further studies are certainly needed to establish molecular connections between a 3 - integrin and Cdc42 , these data suggest that a 3 b 1 - integrin may participate in the regulation of cellular localization and / or activity of Cdc42 during cystogenesis . Nevertheless , our data show that , similar to Cdc42 - KD cells [ 25 ] , Itg a 3 - KD cells fail to properly orient their mitotic spindles despite apparently normal apico - basal polarity . This defect disrupted cellular organization in Figure 5 . a 3 b 1 - integrin is required formitotic spindle orientation . A ) Control , Itg a 3 - , Itg a 2 - and Itg b 1 - KD MDCK cells were grown in 3D BME gel for 4 days , fixed and stained for nuclei ( DAPI ) and actin ( TRITC - phalloidin ) .

B ) To analyze the orientation of cell division axis in cysts , stacks containing 74 mitotic post - metaphase cells from control , Itg a 3 - , Itg a 2 - and Itg b 1 - KD cysts were collected .

Discussion Extracellular matrix is a dynamic scaffold that conveys environmental signals to regulate epithelial morphogenesis during organogenesis . Here we found that two separate integrin - mediated signaling cascades regulate formation of apical lumens in epithelial cells . Importantly , although these two pathways were mechanis - tically distinct , a cystogenesis defect in Itg a 3 - depleted cells was functionally alleviated by the a 2 b 1 / a 6 b 4 - cascade . a 2 b 1 - and a 6 b 4 - integrins were found to be required to establish a Rac1 - dependent basal cue upon binding to collagen matrix leading to apico - basal polarization of the ECM - contacting cell layer . Subsequently , cells entrapped in the forming lumen are cleared by apoptotic cavitation . Because depletion of the laminin - binding b 4 - subunit in collagen gels resulted in a phenotype comparable to those of Itg a 2 - or Itg b 1 - KD cells , it appears that a 2 b 1 ( which is capable of interacting with both collagens and laminins ) alone is not sufficient for generate a laminin - dependent basal cue that would then be conveyed by a 6 b 4 - integrins . Instead , it seems more likely that both a 2 b 1 and a 6 b 4 are required to establish the basal laminin - dependent cue while either one alone is sufficient to convey this signal once the cue is present . Interestingly , only depletion of b 4 - subunit resulted in cystogenesis phenotype whereas Itg a 6 - KD cells appeared largely normal despite robust reduction of both mRNA and protein levels of the a 6 - integrin subunit . It has been reported that ( the cytoplasmic tail of ) b 4 - integrin is sufficient for the recruitment of other hemidesmosomal components and has signaling capacity of its own [ 12 , 26 ] . Although it is currently unclear if b 4 - subunit can reach the cell surface in the absence of a 6 - subunit , a 6 - subunit seems to be dispensable for both of these functions as well as for the cystogenesis phenotypes observed in this study . Once BM is formed or if cells are embedded into laminin - rich BME , apical lumen is generated and maintained by hollowing that is in part regulated by Cdc42 - regulated orientation of mitotic divisions [ 24 , 25 ] . a 3 b 1 - integrins were found to be involved in guiding the orientation of cell division axis in the forming cysts in BME gels . Interestingly , the basal activity of Cdc42 seemed to be stimulated in Itg a 3 - KD cells . Moreover , a dominant active Cdc42 Q61L accumulated at basal side of the Itg a 3 - KD cysts whereas it was predominantly apical when expressed in control cysts . It is tempting to speculate that a 3 b 1 - integrins , for example by recruiting Cdc42 - GTPase - activating proteins or some other factors function to restrict Cdc42 - activity at the cell - ECM contact site and thereby contribute to the signal guiding the orientation of mitotic spindles . On the other hand , previous work has shown that phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is restricted to basolateral membrane domain while PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulates at the apical membrane where it seems to contribute to apical targeting of Cdc42 [ 24 , 27 ] . It is possible that integrin - mediated signaling could regulate , at least to some extent , generation and / or maintenance of specific phosphoinositide domains and thereby affect localization of the key down - stream effectors , such as Cdc42 . Figure 6 . a 3 b 1 - integrin modulates the function of Cdc42 . A ) Control , Itg a 2 - andItg a 3 - KDMDCK cellswere transducedwithGFP - or Cdc42 Q61L - GFP expressing retroviruses .

In addition to spindle orientation , Cdc42 - activation plays a role in the regulation of biosynthetic basolateral membrane trafficking , a process that could potentially contribute to the observed hollowing defect in Itg a 3 - KD cysts [ 28 – 30 ] . However , we have not observed significant biosynthetic membrane traffick - ing phenotypes in Itg a 3 - KD cells ( unpublished data ) suggesting that distinct Cdc42 - signaling complexes participate in the two processes and only the former is regulated by a 3 b 1 - integrins . The seemingly differing roles of a 2 b 1 / a 6 b 4 - and a 3 b 1 - integrins in the regulation of Rac1 - , RhoA - and Cdc42 - mediated pathways during cystogenesis is an interesting finding . RhoGT - Pases are crucial regulators cytoskeletal dynamics , epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation [ 31 ] . More than 20 RhoGT - Pase genes have been described in mammals and they are accompanied by a daunting number of regulatory proteins . The most studied Rho - family members , Rac1 , Cdc42 and RhoA , all regulate integrin signaling but via somewhat different mechanisms [ 32 – 34 ] . The functions of the different RhoGTPases in 3D epithelial culture systems are also clearly distinct [ 8 , 18 , 20 , 24 , 35 ] . Integrin - mediated adhesion activates both Rac1 and Cdc42 but their activation profiles differ due to complex network of regulatory feedback loops that are incompletely understood [ 31 , 36 ] . The role of specific integrins in determining the activation profiles of particular RhoGTPases has not been systematically addressed although different roles for a 2 b 1 - and a 3 b 1 - integrins in the regulation of RhoA - activation have been reported [ 37 , 38 ] . We are not aware of studies systematically addressing the potential integrin - mediated spatial regulation of specific RhoGTPases . Although more detailed analyses are certainly needed , this current study suggests that a 2 b 1 / a 6 b 4 - integrins function to regulate Rac1 / RhoA - dependent basal cue whereas a 3 b 1 - integrins seem to contribute to Cdc42 - dependent positioning of mitotic spindles . As discussed above , such functional specificity could result from selective recruitment of effector complexes to different integrin adhesions . One indication to this direction could be our observation that although a 3 b 1 also contributed to basal Rac1 - activity on collagen ( data not shown ) , it could not rescue the basal cue in Itg a 2 - KD cells . Interestingly , recent studies implicated two distinct Cdc42 - specific GEFs , Intersectin - 2 and Tuba , as regula - tors of mitotic spindle orientation [ 39 , 40 ] . Intersectin - 2 localized to centrosomes whereas Tuba was found subapically . Although both Intersectin - 2 and Tuba regulated Cdc42 - activity , spindle defects in Tuba - deficient cells could not be rescued by overex - pression of Intersectin - 2 suggesting that they activate Cdc42 in distinct complexes [ 39 ] . Clearly , detailed further studies are warranted to address the possible mechanisms how specific integrins might direct RhoGTPase activation to different cellular locations . Further complexity arises from the fact that interacting effectors and co - receptors themselves largely define the function of integrin signaling . For example , a 3 b 1 - integrin appears to participate in two distinct signaling complexes , one at the cell - ECM contact sites and another at adherens junctions where it regulates E - cadherin function and the stability of cell - cell contacts [ 41 – 43 ] . A lot of interaction data exists on specific sets of cytoplasmic effectors that associate with different integrin b - subunits but less is known about integrin a - subunits [ 44 ] . Which are the molecules that could determine the specificity of , for example , a 3 b 1 - and a 2 b 1 - integrin - mediated signals in the regulation of cystogenesis is an important question for further studies . The current findings again highlight the fact that integrins are much more than mere adhesion receptors and reveal a complex functional interplay between different integrins that is not limited by their ligand specificity . Having two redundant mechanisms that depend on different ECM signals is likely to be more error - proof than two pathways triggered by a common cue . Given the importance of robust apical membrane biogenesis during generation and maintenance of epithelial tissues , such plasticity is likely to be crucial to ensure robust epithelial polarization and morphogenesis in vivo .

Generation and modifications of KD - cells Knockdown cells were created as described previously [ 53 , 54 ] . Two functional constructs ( . 70 % KD efficiency as determined by qPCR ) were generated for each gene . For the target sequences see table S1 . When indicated , individual integrin - KD shRNA - expressing MDCK cell clones were picked and expanded . These clonal cell lines were infected with retroviral constructs encoding for dominant active forms of Rac1 or Cdc42 or GFP . Time - lapse fluorescence microscopy The cDNA of mouse E - cadherin was amplified using primers listed in Table S2 and ligated into a modified pN1 - GFP vector using In - Fusion TM PCR cloning kit ( Clontech ) . The resulting fusion protein expresses a full - length mouse E - cadherin followed by an in - frame linker sequence ( GTVPGGGPGGGPGPVAT ) and GFP before the stop codon . For live cell time - lapse movies of developing cysts , a stable MDCK cell line expressing mouse E - cadherin - GFP fusion protein was created and KDs were established as described above .

For imaging of cysts , confocal stacks where collected with approximately 0 . 5 m m increments . Cdc42 - activation assays For analysis of Cdc42 - activation , 3 6 10 5 cells were seeded onto BME gel as described above . After 24 hours of culture , medium was replaced with serum - free MEM . After 48 hours of starvation , cells were lysed and Cdc42 - activities were assayed according to manufacturers instructions ( Cdc42 G - Lisa TM , Cytoskeleton Inc . ) . Analysis of mitotic cells KD and control cells grown 4 Days in BME gels were fixed and stained to visualize actin , acetylated a - tubulin and nuclei . Confocal stacks of the whole cyst structure were collected with approximately 0 . 5 m m increments . The X , Y and Z - coordinates of segregated post - metaphase chromatids and the centre of the cyst were measured with the MacBiophotonics ImageJ software . The relative distances in microns between the three points were calculated and the angles of the resulting triangle solved ( See figure 5C ) . The distance from the midpoint between separated chromatins to the centre of the cyst was calculated and used for determination of the division angles . Statistics Statistical analysis was carried out with the PASW statistics software ( SPSS , Inc . ) . Normal distribution of samples was assessed with the Shapiro - Wilk test . Normally distributed samples were tested for significant differences by one - way ANOVA with multiple comparisons done by Tukeys post hoc method for equal variances or Games - Howells post hoc method for unequal variances . In some cases samples were presented as knockdown / control ratios and tested for significant differences from the value 1 with the Wilcoxon signed rank test or one sample t - tests when normally distributed . The distributions of measured cell division angles in KDs and controls were tested for significant differences using the Mann - Whitney - U test . P - values , 0 . 05 were considered significant . P - values were not calculated for sample sizes smaller than 3 .
