We previously reported the involvement of the actin - severing protein cofilin and the Ca 2 + ATPase secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 ( SPCA1 ) in the sorting of soluble secretory cargo at the TGN in mammalian cells . Now we report that cofilin in yeast is required for export of selective secretory cargo at the late Golgi membranes . In cofilin mu - tant ( cof1 - 8 ) cells , the cell wall protein Bgl2 was secreted at a reduced rate and retained in a late Golgi compartment , whereas the plasma membrane H + ATPase Pma1 , which is trans - ported in the same class of carriers , reached the cell surface . In addition , sorting of carboxy - peptidase Y ( CPY ) to the vacuole was delayed , and CPY was secreted from cof1 - 8 cells . Loss of the yeast orthologue of SPCA1 ( Pmr1 ) exhibited similar sorting defects and displayed synthetic sickness with cof1 - 8 . In addition , overexpression of PMR1 restored Bgl2 secretion in cof1 - 8 cells . These findings highlight the conserved role of cofilin and SPCA1 / Pmr1 in sort - ing of the soluble secretory proteins at the TGN / late Golgi membranes in eukaryotes . INTRODUCTION Secretory cargoes of eukaryotic cells are transported from the en - doplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to the Golgi membranes by COPII - coated vesicles ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ) . ER - resident KDEL ( HDEL in yeast ) - containing proteins are transported back to the ER in COPI vesicles by binding the KDEL ( HDEL ) receptor ( Lewis and Pelham , 1990 ) . Within the Golgi apparatus , there are many exit routes , and secretory cargo must be sorted to ensure that it is delivered to the correct destination . In yeast and higher eukaryotes the trafficking and sorting of secreted proteins from the Golgi membranes remain poorly understood . In the late Golgi mem - branes of higher eukaryotes , mannose - 6 - phosphate – containing lysosomal hydrolases bind the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( M6PR ) and are packed into clathrin - coated vesicles for export to the endosomes / lysosomes ( Baranski et al . , 1990 ) . Sorting of lyso - somal hydrolases in yeast also occurs via endosomes and clathrin - coated vesicles , and the best - characterized example is carboxy - peptidase Y ( CPY ) , which is sorted by direct interaction with its receptor Vps10 ( Cooper and Stevens , 1996 ) . A distant M6PR ortho - logue does exist in yeast , Mrl1 , which affects transport of some soluble hydrolases , but it is unclear whether this is through a gly - can - based interaction as in mammalian cells or through a peptide - based interaction as observed for CPY ( Whyte and Munro , 2001 ) . In yeast , there are at least two transport routes from the late Golgi compartment to the cell surface , which have been classified based on vesicle densities , cargoes , and some of the molecular re - quirements for their biogenesis ( Harsay and Bretscher , 1995 ; David et al . , 1998 ) . The low - density secretory vesicles ( LDSVs ) are trans - ported directly to the cell surface and contain the soluble cargo Bgl2 and the plasma membrane H + ATPase Pma1 , whereas the high - density secretory vesicles ( HDSVs ) transit through the endosomal system , require clathrin and the dynamin - like GTPase Vps1 , and contain invertase and acid phosphatase as cargoes ( Gurunathan et al . , 2002 ; Harsay and Schekman , 2002 ) . No receptors for secre - tory cargo in the Golgi compartments have been identified in yeast or mammals . More recent studies revealed the involvement of calcium and pH in cargo sorting from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) .

J . Curwin et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell in vitro for various functions such as F - or G - actin binding , actin filament depolymerization , and PIP 2 binding ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Drubin and colleagues generated three co - filin temperature - sensitive ( ts ) alleles : cof1 - 5 , cof1 - 8 , and cof1 - 22 . The cof1 - 22 – mutant protein is defective in F - actin binding , the mutant cof1 - 5 protein is defective in G - actin binding , and the cof1 - 8 – mutant protein was not characterized for these activities but was later shown to be defective in PIP 2 binding ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Clearly these mutants are severely defective in cofilin function in vivo at the nonpermis - sive temperature of 37°C , as indicated by dramatic changes in ac - tin organization and defective endocytosis . We tested these alleles for their ability to affect secretion of the cell wall protein Bgl2 . Cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 25°C and shifted to 37°C for 2 h before removal of the cell wall and determination of intracel - lular Bgl2 . Bgl2 is secreted rapidly postsynthesis and nearly unde - tectable in the spheroplasts of wild - type cells . All three cofilin ts alleles accumulated Bgl2 to similar levels as a sec14 - 1 ts strain known to block transport of Bgl2 ( Figure 1A ; Curwin et al . , 2009 ) . We also tested these cofilin mutants at permissive temperatures of 25 and 30°C . The sec14 - 1 control only accumulated Bgl2 at the nonpermissive temperature of 37°C , whereas all cofilin ts alleles exhibited a Bgl2 transport defect regardless of temperature ( Figure 1A ) . To discard the possibility of differences in protein translation , we also examined total and extracellular Bgl2 . There was no reduction in the extracellular levels of Bgl2 in cofilin mu - tants or the sec14 - 1 control , as Bgl2 is highly abundant in the cell wall , and a complete block in transport over a long period of time would be required to see reduction in the steady - state extracellu - lar levels ( Supplemental Figure S1A ) . Total Bgl2 was determined in nonspheroplasted cells , and overall levels of Bgl2 were virtually unaltered . A slight increase in total Bgl2 compared with controls was observed only at 25°C for cof1 - 8 , cof1 - 5 , and cof1 - 22 , but this did not account for the accumulated internal Bgl2 ( Supplemental Figure S1A ) . Other non – temperature - sensitive alleles , which affect the function of cofilin to a lesser extent , were also tested . For ex - ample , two alleles cof1 - 18 and cof1 - 19 that do not affect in vivo actin organization or growth ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) also did not affect Bgl2 transport ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) . It has been shown the cof1 - 19 allele affects actin patch mobility in vivo , and the mu - tant protein has defects in PIP 2 and G - actin binding in vitro , whereas the cof1 - 18 mutant protein has no characterized defects ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ; Ojala et al . , 2001 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ) . One allele , cof1 - 4 , which does not affect growth but affects actin orga - nization ( to lesser extent than the ts alleles ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , did accumulate Bgl2 ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) . The cof1 - 4 allele contains a serine - to - alanine mutation in the conserved serine residue known to regulate cofilin function in higher eukaryotes . Together these data indicate that cofilin activity is required for Bgl2 transport . Mildly perturbing cofilin function was not sufficient to result in Bgl2 accumulation , and this phenotype was only ob - served in those alleles severe enough to lead to noticeable changes in the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure S1 ) . We chose to focus on the cof1 - 8 allele at 30°C for fur - ther analysis to maintain a background with relatively high reduc - tion in cofilin activity but less effect on endocytosis compared with cof1 - 5 and cof1 - 22 , which reportedly exhibit more endocytic prob - lems , even at permissive temperatures ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . We first determined that the defect in Bgl2 transport in cof1 - 8 cells could be restored by exog - enous expression of wild - type COF1 ( Figure 1B ) . the LDSV - specific integral membrane protein Pma1 depends on the pH of the late Golgi membranes in yeast ( Huang and Chang , 2011 ) . Calcium homeostasis in the TGN and its role in secretory cargo sort - ing require the actin filament – severing protein cofilin and the Ca 2 + ATPase secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 ( SPCA1 ) in mammalian cells ( von Blume et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . A defect in the activity of these proteins causes retention of some of the secretory cargoes in the TGN , whereas others are exported at normal or higher rates . Of in - terest , under such conditions , a soluble TGN resident protein , Cab45 , and the lysosomal protease cathepsin D are also secreted from the cells ( von Blume et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . These findings are beginning to reveal components of the secretory cargo - sorting ma - chinery from the TGN . However , one key issue is whether cofilin and SPCA1 have a similar role in the sorting of secretory cargo in other organisms . In addition , the yeast Golgi membranes , unlike the mam - malian Golgi apparatus , are not stacked , thus raising the question of whether cargo sorting for trafficking to the cell surface in yeast is by a mechanism similar to that in mammalian cells . Cofilin and actin dynamics clearly regulate endocytosis in yeast ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . The requirement of cofilin in protein transport from the Golgi apparatus of yeast is not known . Actin , on the other hand , has been implicated in secretion ; however , its exact role in this process , or more specifically at the Golgi mem - branes , is not well understood ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Mulhol - land et al . , 1997 ; Karpova et al . , 2000 ) . Cofilin functions by binding monomeric or filamentous actin and depolymerizing actin filaments and as such regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cortical actin patches , which are proposed sites of endocytosis in yeast ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . The regulation of cofilin has similarities in yeast and higher eukaryotes , such as regulation by pH and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) binding ( Van Troys et al . , 2008 ) . Regulation by phosphorylation is an important mechanism of regulation in mammalian cells , although no cofilin kinases or phosphatases have been identified in yeast ( Mor - gan et al . , 1993 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ) . However , this may be a con - served mode of regulation , since mutation of the conserved serine residue to glutamate , which would constitutively inactive cofilin , is lethal ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . We tested the requirement of cofilin in cargo sorting and export from the Golgi apparatus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Our findings reveal that cofilin is required for the sorting of select cargo at the late Golgi membranes . The LDSV cargo Bgl2 was found to accumu - late in the Golgi membranes of cofilin - mutant cells , whereas Pma1 transport was unaffected . The trafficking of HDSV - specific cargo in - vertase was mildly affected , whereas the rate of CPY transport to the vacuole was reduced and CPY was secreted from cofilin - mutant cells . Similar sorting defects are described for cells lacking the Golgi apparatus – localized Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 , and we report here that a cofilin mutant interacts genetically with loss of PMR1 . Moreover , ex - ogenous expression of PMR1 restored the Bgl2 secretion in cofilin - mutant cells . Together these data indicate that cofilin and actin dy - namics regulate protein sorting in the yeast Golgi apparatus and likely do so through Pmr1 as in mammalian cells . RESULTS Bgl2 secretion is impaired in cofilin mutants S . cerevisiae contains a single cofilin gene , which is essential for viability ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . A number of mutant alleles of cofilin have been generated , and these have facilitated the analy - sis of cofilin’s role in regulation of actin dynamics through the activ - ity of actin filament depolymerization . Many of these cofilin mu - tants have been generated as recombinant proteins and examined Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Cargo sorting at the Golgi apparatus | 2329 To examine the effect of cof1 - 8 in endocytosis at the permissive temperature of 30°C , we analyzed the trafficking of the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 from the plasma membrane to the vacuole via endo - somes . Cells were incubated with FM4 - 64 for 15 min , washed , and incubated for 45 min to examine the rate of transport to the vacuole via the endosomes . As expected , at the nonpermissive tempera - ture of 37°C , the cof1 - 8 mutant failed to internalize the majority of FM - 464 . However there was no defect in the internalization or the rate of FM - 464 transport at the permissive temperature of 30°C ( Figure 1C ) . Next we determined the organization of the actin cy - toskeleton in cof1 - 8 cells compared with wild type at 30 and 37°C by staining fixed cells with phalloidin . Wild - type cells , regardless of temperature , contained actin patches mostly in the daughter ( budding ) cell ; filamentous actin cables were often observed tra - versing the mother – bud axis ; however , these were less pronounced at 37°C . In cof1 - 8 cells at 37°C , the actin cytoskeleton was clearly perturbed , with fewer actin patches that were much larger and de - polarized . No actin cables were visible , but instead thick actin struc - tures were observed in nearly all cells . In cof1 - 8 cells grown at 30°C , the actin cytoskeleton was much less affected than at 37°C , and al - though depolarized , it was fairly normal in overall appearance . ( Figure 1D ) . Latrunculin A ( Lat - A ) blocks actin polymerization and therefore counteracts the activity of cofilin . There was no change in intracellular accumulation of Bgl2 in cof1 - 8 cells treated with Lat - A ( Figure 1E ) . On the other hand , 30 min of treatment with Lat - A treatment in wild - type cells resulted in Bgl2 accumulation , indicat - ing that general perturbations in actin dynamics affect Bgl2 export from the Golgi membranes . This is not surprising , as Lat - A treat - ment has been shown to result in the intracellular accumulation of invertase and post – Golgi compartment vesicles ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Karpova et al . , 2000 ) . A reduced rate of endocytosis does not affect Bgl2 export from the Golgi membranes To further address the connection between cofilin’s roles in regula - tion of endocytosis and secretion , we examined Bgl2 transport in a number of mutants defective in endocytosis . Abp1 and Aip1 are two proteins that function intimately with cofilin in the formation of actin patches and the regulation of endocytosis . Abp1 localizes to sites of endocytosis before cofilin and is required to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Aip1 interacts directly with cofilin and is required to restrict cofilin localization to cortical patches and promote actin filament turnover ( Clark and Amberg , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ) . As before , intracellular accumulation of Bgl2 was deter - mined in spheroplasted cells . Deletion of either of these proteins did not lead to intracellular accumulation of Bgl2 ( Figure 2A ) . We also examined the secretion of Bgl2 in other endocytic mutants that do not interact directly with cofilin at actin patches but are report - edly blocked in all forms of endocytosis , including receptor - medi - ated endocytosis , fluid - phase endocytosis , and FM4 - 64 transport ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . These included endocytic mutants that function directly at sites of endocytosis ( Sla1 , Sla2 , Inp51 , and End3 ) and endocytic mutants that block endocytosis in - directly by affecting ergosterol synthesis ( Erg2 , Erg3 , and Erg6 ) . Sla1 binds actin and End3 , and these are required for cortical actin as - sembly and endocytosis ( Tang et al . , 1997 , 2000 ; Warren et al . , 2002 ) ; Sla2 is a transmembrane protein that links actin and clathrin at sites of endocytosis ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) ; Inp51 is a PIP 2 phosphatase of the synaptojanin family that regulates PIP 2 homeostasis at the plasma membrane ( PM ) and is required for en - docytosis ( Singer - Kruger et al . , 1998 ) ; Erg2 is a sterol isomerase catalyzing an intermediate step in ergosterol biosynthesis ( Ashman FIGURE 1 : Cofilin and actin are required for proper secretion of Bgl2 . ( A ) Wild - type , sec14 - 1 , and the indicated cofilin mutant cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 25 or 30°C . Cells grown at 25°C were also shifted to 37°C for 2 h . Equal cell numbers were treated to generate spheroplasts , washed to remove the cell wall , and analyzed by Western blot to determine the amount of intracellular Bgl2 . ( B ) Wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells expressing empty vector or COF1 were grown at 30°C and treated as in A to determine the intracellular levels of Bgl2 . ( C ) FM4 - 64 transport was determined in live cells grown at 30°C or preshifted to 37°C for 1 h . Cells were labeled with 40 μM FM4 - 64 for 15 min ( at 30 or 37°C , respectively ) . Cells were washed and resuspended in fresh , prewarmed YPD and further incubated at 30 or 37°C for 45 min . Scale bar , 5 μm . ( D ) Actin organization was examined by staining with phalloidin . Cells were grown at 30°C to logarithmic phase and either fixed directly in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde or shifted to 37°C for 1 h before fixation . Scale bar , 5 μm . ( E ) Wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells were grown to 30°C and treated with 100 μM latrunculin A ( Lat - A ) or dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . Equal cell numbers were taken at the indicated times , and spheroplasts were generated and analyzed by Western blot for detection of Bgl2 . 2330 | A . J . Curwin et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell expected , at steady state , in wild - type cells Snc1 - GFP was visible at the PM of the growing bud and internal structures previously identi - fied as TGN and endosomes ( Figure 2B ; Robinson et al . , 2006 ) . However , in cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C Snc1 - GFP was only visible in the PM , and the localization was no longer polarized to the growing bud but instead was distributed uniformly in the PM of the growing cells ( Figure 2B ) . This implies that the rate of endocytosis and polarized secretion is affected in cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C . This is not surprising , since the actin cytoskeleton is also depolarized at this temperature ( Figure 1D ) . Snc1 – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) localization is of - ten used to assess the rate of endocytosis , and a PM - only localiza - tion is a hallmark of a defect in endocytosis . However , when we ex - amined the localization of the Snc1 - GFP in the other endocytic mutants described , we observed varying phenotypes . Snc1 - GFP lo - calization was similar to cof1 - 8 cells in end3 ∆ and sla2 ∆ cells : only PM and depolarized . A similar phenotype was observed in sla1 ∆ cells but to a lesser extent , with some internal punctate structures still visible and a polarized localization . In inp51 ∆ cells , Snc1 - GFP localization was almost normal , with occasional depolarization . Of interest , erg3 ∆ and erg6 ∆ cells exhibited more internal Snc1 - GFP localization compared with wild type , and erg3 ∆ cells had even less signal of Snc1 - GFP at the PM than erg6 ∆ . However , erg3 ∆ and erg6 ∆ cells still retained a polarized localization of Snc1 - GFP , whereas erg2 ∆ cells were virtually indistinguishable from wild type . The two deletion strains defective in Bgl2 transport , sla2 ∆ and erg6 ∆ , exhibited opposite Snc1 - GFP localizations ; wild type – like lo - calization in erg6 ∆ cells , and PM only in sla2 ∆ cells . Steady - state Snc1 - GFP localization is dependent on the rate of export from the Golgi membranes , the rate of endocytosis , and the rate of retrieval from endosomes . Clearly a decreased rate of endocytosis does not always lead to a PM - only localization of Snc1 - GFP , as observed in inp51 ∆ , erg2 ∆ , erg3 ∆ , and erg6 ∆ cells . Loss of function of proteins affecting multiple steps in the Snc1 - GFP cycling ( which is likely the case for Sla2 , Erg6 , and cofilin ) leads to varying phenotypes . Bgl2 rate of transport is decreased and accumulates in a late - Golgi compartment in cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C To determine more precisely whether the rate of Bgl2 transport was affected in cof1 - 8 cells and to control for a potential increase in rate of Bgl2 synthesis in cof1 - 8 cells , we performed a pulse chase and immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized Bgl2 in intracellular ver - sus extracellular fractions . Wild type and cof1 - 8 and cells were labeled at 30°C with [ 35 S ] methionine for 5 min and chased with 50 mM methionine for 0 , 10 , and 30 min ( sec14 - 1 cells were labeled in the same way but at 37°C , with a 30 - min pre - shift to this tempera - ture ) . In wild - type cells Bgl2 is clearly secreted much faster when compared with cof1 - 8 and sec14 - 1 cells ( Figure 3A ) . Results of three independent experiments were quantitated , and the percentage of internal Bgl2 compared with total ( intracellular and extracellular ) was plotted over time . At time 0 wild - type cells had 90 . 0 % Bgl2 internal , compared with 95 . 3 and 94 . 1 % for cof1 - 8 and sec14 - 1 cells , respec - tively , indicating that during the 5 - min pulse period wild - type cells secreted ∼ 5 % more than either mutant . By 10 min postchase , wild - type cells contained 46 . 3 % internal Bgl2 , compared with 66 . 9 % in cof1 - 8 cells and 81 . 8 % in sec14 - 1 cells , and by 30 min postchase , the difference in the rate of Bgl2 secretion was even more pro - nounced , with wild - type cells only retaining 12 . 1 % of total Bgl2 in - ternally , compared with 49 . 2 and 62 . 4 % in cof1 - 8 and sec14 - 1 cells , respectively ( Figure 3B ) . Therefore the accumulation of internal Bgl2 observed in cof1 - 8 cells is due to a decreased rate of transport and not to increased Bgl2 expression in cof1 - 8 cells compared with wild type . et al . , 1991 ) ; Erg3 is a sterol desaturase , generating a precursor in ergosterol biosynthesis ( Arthington et al . , 1991 ) ; and Erg6 is a meth - yltransferase converting zymosterol to fecosterol in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway and acts upstream of both Erg2 and Erg3 ( Lees et al . , 1995 ; Parks et al . , 1995 ) . Of these seven endocytic mu - tants , only two , erg6 ∆ and sla2 ∆ , exhibited accumulation of Bgl2 ( Figure 2A ) . Of interest , Sla2 is a clathrin adapter , linking clathrin and actin , and sla2 ∆ cells have been shown to accumulate post – Golgi compartment vesicles ( Mulholland et al . , 1997 ) . The human Sla2 ho - mologue ( Hip1R ) has also been implicated in transport from the TGN ( Carreno et al . , 2004 ) . Erg6 is an enzyme required for ergos - terol synthesis , and perturbing ergosterol levels would alter lipid homeostasis in the Golgi membranes , which is known to affect se - cretion of some cargoes ( Proszynski et al . , 2005 ; Klemm et al . , 2009 ) . We suggest that the accumulation of Bgl2 in erg6 ∆ and sla2 ∆ mu - tant cells is likely due to direct effects on the function of the Golgi apparatus . Taken together , these data strongly indicate that the de - fect in Bgl2 secretion in cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C is not due to a defect in endocytosis . To further assess defects in endocytosis in cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C , we examined the localization of the vesicle soluble N - ethylmaleim - ide – sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( v - SNARE ) Snc1 . Snc1 is packaged into both HDSV and LDSV transport carriers for export from the Golgi apparatus ( Gurunathan et al . , 2002 ) . After reaching the PM , Snc1 is internalized via endosomes , recycled back to the TGN , and then transported to the PM ( Lewis et al . , 2000 ) . As FIGURE 2 : Endocytosis is not required for proper secretion of Bgl2 . ( A ) The indicated endocytosis - defective strains were grown at 30°C to logarithmic phase , spheroplasts were generated , cell walls were removed , and intracellular Bgl2 was examined by Western blot . ( B ) Snc1 - GFP localization was examined in live cells grown to logarithmic phase at 30°C . Scale bar , 5 μm . Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Cargo sorting at the Golgi apparatus | 2331 was readily reproducible in the fractioned membranes , and ER and Golgi membranes were separated by this method . The Bgl2 - con - taining fractions were clearly excluded from the ER and followed a Golgi membrane – like distribution . The results of three independent gradients were compiled and plotted ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . To further ascertain the location of Bgl2 in cof1 - 8 cells , we visualized endogenous Bgl2 by immunofluorescence microscopy using a puri - fied anti - Bgl2 antibody . Cells were grown at 30°C and fixed in form - aldehyde , and extracellular Bgl2 was removed by digestion of the cell wall before permeabilization and detection by immunofluores - cence . In cof1 - 8 cells , Bgl2 - containing punctate structures were eas - ily observed . Such structures were only evident in wild - type cells with increased exposure , whereas bgl2 ∆ control cells contained no such elements ( Figure 3C ) . Colocalization with Golgi membranes and endosome markers in cof1 - 8 cells revealed Bgl2 in a compart - ment closely apposed to the late Golgi membrane – specific marker Sec7 - RFP , whereas no such proximity was observed with the early Golgi membrane marker Anp1 - RFP or the endosome marker Pep12 - RFP or Tlg1 - RFP ( Figure 3D ) . Together these data indicate that Bgl2 accumulates in cof1 - 8 cells in a late Golgi compartment . Cargo - selective effect on secretion in cof1 - 8 cells To determine whether cofilin affects protein secretion in general , we asked whether the cof1 - 8 allele affected total secretion of proteins into the medium at the permissive temperature of 30°C . Wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells were labeled with [ 35 S ] methionine for 10 min , and this pulse medium was replaced with chase medium containing 50 mM methionine to clearly see the rate of protein transport during 10 - , 30 - , and 60 - min chase periods . Cells with a ts allele of the gene encoding N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) – sensitive factor , sec18 - 1 , were cultured in the same way but shifted to the nonpermissive tempera - ture of 37°C at 1 h before and during the pulse chase as a control to block secretion ( Graham and Emr , 1991 ) . There were no obvious changes in the total levels of proteins secreted , indicating that cof1 - 8 cells do not exhibit a general block in protein secretion . There were some minor differences between the proteins secreted into the medium from wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells at the 30 - min time point , with three bands present in higher amounts ( labeled + ) and four bands present in lower amounts ( labeled – ) ; however , these dif - ferences were virtually undetectable at the 60 - min time point , indi - cating there may be differences in the rate of secretion of some proteins but not in the overall amounts secreted ( Figure 4A ) . To further determine cofilin’s ability to affect export of proteins from the Golgi membranes , we tested a number of other cargoes directly that are transported by various routes from the Golgi appa - ratus . Invertase , a soluble enzyme of the periplasmic space , is se - creted in response to glucose deprivation and known to be trans - ported by HDSV ( Harsay and Bretscher , 1995 ) . The activity of invertase was measured in intact cells ( extracellular pool ) versus ly - sed cells ( total ) to determine the percentage of invertase secreted by cells starved of glucose for 2 h . Wild - type cells secreted 82 % of invertase , whereas sec14 - 1 cells ( grown and starved at nonpermis - sive temperature ) , known to block transport of this enzyme , exhib - ited 36 % secretion ( Bankaitis et al . , 1989 ) . However , cof1 - 8 cells ex - hibited a modest decrease in invertase secretion , to 69 % , and this was only marginally statistically significant ( p = 0 . 04 ; Supplemental Figure S3A ) . To determine more precisely the rate of transport of invertase , we performed pulse - chase and immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized invertase . After 15 min of glucose deprivation , cells were labeled with [ 35 S ] methionine for 5 min and then incubated with 50 mM methionine for 0 , 10 , and 30 min . Invertase was then immunoprecipitated from intracellular and extracellular fractions . To determine the intracellular location of the Bgl2 in cof1 - 8 cells , we tested its location with respect to ER and Golgi membranes . Wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells grown at 30°C were spheroplasted and homogenized , and the membrane - bound compartments were frac - tionated to equilibrium on a continuous 30 – 60 % sucrose gradient . The accumulation of Bgl2 in cof1 - 8 cells compared with wild type FIGURE 3 : Bgl2 rate of transport is decreased and accumulates in a late Golgi compartment . ( A ) Bgl2 rate of transport was determined in wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C and sec14 - 1 cells at 37°C by pulse - chase labeling of newly synthesized protein with [ 35 S ] methionine . Equal cell numbers were labeled with 100 μCi / time point , spheroplasts were generated , and Bgl2 was immunoprecipitated from intracellular and extracellular fractions at the indicated times and detected by SDS – PAGE / autoradiography . ( B ) Results of three independent Bgl2 pulse - chase and immunoprecipitations were quantitated , and the sum of internal and external fractions at a given time point was taken as 100 % . The percentage internal Bgl2 was plotted vs . time using GraphPad Prism software . Error bars represent SEM . ( C ) Wild - type , cof1 - 8 , and bgl2 ∆ cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 30°C . Cells were fixed in formaldehyde , spheroplasted , and permeabilized for indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti - Bgl2 antibody ( green ) . Nuclei were stained with 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( blue ) , and the samples were slightly overexposed to clearly show the cells in wild type and bgl2 ∆ . Scale bar , 3 μm . ( C ) cof1 - 8 cells were grown at 30°C expressing the indicated Golgi membrane ( Sec7 - DsRed , trans - Golgi membrane ; Anp1 – red fluorescent protein [ RFP ] , early Golgi membrane ) and endosome ( mCherry - Pep12 and mCherry - Tlg1 ) markers . Cells were treated as in B for immunofluorescence staining with anti - Bgl2 antibody ( green ) and anti - RFP ( red ) to detect the marker protein . Stacks of images were taken and treated with deconvolution software to reduce the background signal . Scale bar , 3 μm . 2332 | A . J . Curwin et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Invertase is core glycosylated in the ER and is hyperglycosylated within the Golgi apparatus . In wild - type cells invertase was com - pletely secreted in a hyperglycosylated form by 10 min postchase , with no detectable internal invertase . The cof1 - 8 cells exhibited a decrease in the amount of secreted invertase , and a very small amount of hyperglycosylated invertase was still present intracellu - larly at 10 and 30 min postchase ( Figure 4B ) . This correlates well with the slight decrease we observed by measuring activity after 2 h of glucose deprivation and also indicates that this effect is due to a decrease in the rate of transport at the level of the Golgi apparatus . The plasma membrane H + ATPase Pma1 is transported from the TGN via LDSV ( Harsay and Bretscher , 1995 ) . We expressed Pma1 - GFP in wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells and visualized its location by fluo - rescence microscopy . As expected , in wild - type cells Pma1 - GFP lo - calized uniformly in the plasma membrane . In cof1 - 8 cells grown at 30°C the localization of Pma1 - GFP was unaffected , indicating that there is not a complete block in the LDSV pathway and no missort - ing of Pma1 - GFP to the vacuole ( Supplemental Figure S3B ) . How - ever , as Pma1 is very stable at the PM , it is possible there are differ - ences in the rate of transport not detectable by this method . Therefore we examined the localization of hemagglutinin ( HA ) - Pma1 under the control of MET25 promoter by immunofluorescence mi - croscopy . HA - Pma1 reaches the PM after 90 min of derepression in methionine - free medium ( Luo and Chang , 2000 ) , and therefore we examined the localization after 30 and 60 min . Unfortunately , we were unable to detect intermediate steps ( ER and Golgi membranes ) of HA - Pma1 transport by this method , which was likely complicated by the fact that under repressing conditions a very low level of HA - Pma1 was detectable ( even when double repressing amounts of methionine were used ) , and this was more pronounced in the wild - type cells ( Figure 4E ) . Similarly , upon derepression , the overall ex - pression level of HA - Pma1 was somewhat higher in wild - type cells compared with cof1 - 8 cells . Despite these slight differences in the expression of HA - Pma1 , there was no major difference in the rate of transport of newly synthesized HA - Pma1 , as both 30 - and 60 - min time points showed mostly PM staining in wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells , although we cannot exclude the possibility of a minor kinetic delay that could not be detected by this method ( Figure 4C ) . Hxt1 - CFP and Can1 are transmembrane proteins of the plasma membrane , and whereas the route for their transport from the TGN to the cell surface is not known , there was no defect in their trafficking in cof1 - 8 cells when compared with wild type ( unpublished data ) . These findings indicate that the cof1 - 8 allele affects protein sorting at the Golgi apparatus , since the rate of transport of some cargoes leaving the Golgi membrane was affected without a general block in secretion or in the trafficking of a specific subset of Golgi mem - brane – derived vesicles destined to the cell surface . The role of Pmr1 in cofilin - dependent Bgl2 secretion Pmr1 is the yeast orthologue of SPCA1 , a Ca 2 + / Mn 2 + ATPase local - ized to the Golgi apparatus ( Antebi and Fink , 1992 ) . Yeast cells lack - ing Pmr1 display various phenotypes associated with Golgi appara - tus dysfunction , including secretion of heterologous yeast / mammalian proteins normally retained internally , secretion of CPY , and a defect in glycosylation ( Rudolph et al . , 1989 ; Antebi and Fink , 1992 ; Durr et al . , 1998 ; Bonangelino et al . , 2002 ) . We previously identified SPCA1 as a downstream component of cofilin / actin – de - pendent protein sorting in human cells ( von Blume et al . , 2011 ) . We therefore asked whether Pmr1 in yeast cells was also involved in cofilin - dependent cargo sorting from the late Golgi membranes . First we examined transport of CPY in pmr1 ∆ and cof1 - 8 cells . CPY FIGURE 4 : General secretion is not blocked in cof1 - 8 cells , but some cargoes are specifically affected . ( A ) Proteins secreted in the medium of wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells grown at 30°C and sec18 - 1 cells grown at 30°C and preshifted to 37°C for 1 h were detected by pulse - chase labeling of newly synthesized proteins . Cells were labeled with 150 μCi / ml [ 35 S ] methionine for 10 min . The pulse medium was removed and replaced with chase medium containing 50 mM methionine for 10 , 30 , and 60 min . Secreted proteins in the medium were precipitated with TCA and detected by SDS – PAGE / autoradiography . Bands labeled ( + ) are secreted at higher rates and bands labeled ( – ) are secreted at lower rates in cof1 - 8 cells . These differences were much less pronounced at 60 min . ( B ) Invertase rate of transport was determined in wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C by pulse - chase labeling of newly synthesized protein with [ 35 S ] methionine . Cells were cultured in SC - methionine and 0 . 1 % glucose for 15 min before ( and during ) labeling , equal cell numbers were labeled with 100 μCi / time point , spheroplasts were generated , and invertase was immunoprecipitated from intracellular and extracellular fractions at the indicated times and detected by SDS – PAGE / autoradiography . ( C ) Transport of newly synthesized Pma1 at 30°C was determined in cells expressing Pma1 - HA under the control of the MET25 methionine - repressible promoter . Synthesis was induced by washing cells free of methionine , and samples were fixed , spheroplasted , and permeabilized at the indicated time points for indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti - HA antibody .

Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Cargo sorting at the Golgi apparatus | 2333 CPY , similar to the vacuolar protein - sorting mutants vps4 ∆ and vps27 ∆ , whereas wild - type cells did not ( Figure 5A ) . CPY transport from the ER to Golgi apparatus results in the conversion from p1 to p2 form of CPY , and further transport to the vacuole leads to pro - teolytic processing of CPY to the mature form ( Valls et al . , 1987 ) . The rate of CPY transport was assessed in cof1 - 8 and pmr1 ∆ cells grown at 30°C by pulse - chase analysis . Cells were labeled for 5 min with [ 35 S ] methi - onine and chased with 50 mM methionine for 0 , 10 , and 20 min , and CPY was immuno - precipitated from the lysates . Trafficking and processing of CPY occurs rapidly in wild - type cells , and by 10 min postchase all CPY was processed to the mature , vacuolar form . In cof1 - 8 cells , CPY trafficking was delayed , and at the 10 - min time point all three forms were detected ( Figure 5B ) . However , by 20 min postchase nearly all CPY was found in the mature form in cof1 - 8 cells . The de - creased rate of CPY transport was even more pronounced in pmr1 ∆ cells , and at the 20 - min time point a significant amount of CPY was still in the unprocessed form ( Fig - ure 5B ) . Therefore this decrease in the rate of CPY transport leads to its secretion from the Golgi membranes , further indicating a defect in protein sorting and not complete block of transport from the Golgi mem - branes in cof1 - 8 cells . Then we tested whether cofilin and PMR1 exhibit a genetic interaction . Double - mutant pmr1 ∆ cof1 - 8 strains were gener - ated and tested by serial dilution for growth . There was a slight growth defect in the dou - ble mutant compared with single mutants at 25°C , and at 30°C a strong synthetic sick - ness was observed ( Figure 5C ) . To test the specificity of the genetic interaction , dou - ble - mutant pmc1 ∆ cof1 - 8 strains were gen - erated . Pmc1 is a homologue of Pmr1 that localizes to the vacuole ( Cunningham and Fink , 1994 ) . Pmc1 and Pmr1 can functionally complement one another , as either single deletion is viable , but a strain lacking both Pmr1 and Pmc1 is not viable ( Cunningham and Fink , 1994 ) . Cells with pmc1 ∆ cof1 - 8 did not exhibit any synthetic sickness as ob - served in pmr1 ∆ cof1 - 8 cells ( Figure 5C ) . Furthermore , the growth defect in pmr1 ∆ cof1 - 8 cells at 30°C could be restored by expression of wild - type COF1 and / or PMR1 ( Figure 5D ) . The cofilin mutants and pmr1 ∆ cells secrete CPY . Therefore we examined secretion of Bgl2 and invertase in pmr1 ∆ cells , as de - scribed . Secretion of invertase was only mildly affected in cof1 - 8 cells , at 69 compared with 82 % in wild - type cells ( Figure 4B ) . Simi - larly , in pmr1 ∆ cells invertase was unaffected , secreting 79 % ( unpub - lished data ) . Bgl2 secretion was also affected in pmr1 ∆ cells , al - though not to the extent observed in cof1 - 8 cells ( Figure 5E ) . However , statistical analysis of multiple experiments revealed that is transported from the ER to the vacuole via the Golgi apparatus ( Valls et al . , 1987 ) . Secretion of CPY extracellularly can occur if there is a block or delay in CPY transport from the late Golgi compartment to vacuole via endosomes , a phenotype previously reported for cof1 - 22 cells ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) and pmr1 ∆ cells ( Bonan - gelino et al . , 2002 ) . We tested whether cof1 - 8 cells grown at 30°C secreted CPY . Yeast harboring the indicated mutations and the wild - type cells were grown on solid medium on nitrocellulose filters for 48 h . Filters were removed and tested for the presence of secreted CPY by Western blotting . Both pmr1 ∆ and cof1 - 8 cells secreted FIGURE 5 : cof1 - 8 and pmr1 ∆ cells have a synthetic sickness and share protein - sorting phenotypes . ( A ) Yeast cells were grown in YPD to logarithmic phase , and equal cell numbers were spotted on YPD solid medium and allowed to dry , and a nitrocellulose filter was overlaid for 48 h at 30°C . Secreted CPY was detected on the filter by Western blot against CPY . ( B ) CPY transport at 30°C was examined in wild - type , cof1 - 8 , and pmr1 ∆ cells by pulse - chase labeling of newly synthesized protein with [ 35 S ] methionine . Equal cell numbers were labeled with 100 μCi / time point , and CPY was immunoprecipitated from lysates at the indicated times and detected by SDS – PAGE / autoradiography . ( C ) The indicated strains were grown to logarithmic phase at 25°C , and equal cell numbers were serially diluted and spotted on YPD medium and further incubated at 25 or 30°C for 48 h . ( D ) Yeast strains expressing the indicated vectors were grown to logarithmic phase , and equal cell numbers were serially diluted and spotted on selection medium to maintain plasmids and incubated 48 h at 30°C . ( E , F ) Cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 30°C , and equal cell numbers were treated to generate spheroplasts and washed to remove the cell wall ; spheroplasts were analyzed by Western blot to determine the amount of intracellular Bgl2 . Quantitation of Bgl2 was performed and normalized to Pgk1 loading control . Amounts relative to wild type were determined for three independent experiments , analyzed , and plotted using GraphPad Prism software . Error bars represent SEM . 2334 | A . J . Curwin et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Bgl2 and Pma1 are transported in the same class of vesicles from 3 . the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface ( Harsay and Bretscher , 1995 ) . The fact that cof1 - 8 does not affect trafficking of Pma1 strongly suggests that the defect is in the sorting and / or packing of Bgl2 and not in the budding or the departure of the specific vesicles from the late Golgi compartment . Bgl2 rate of transport is decreased , and it is retained in a late 4 . Golgi compartment , which further supports our proposal that cofilin is required for the sorting of secretory cargo in the late Golgi membranes . Cofilin and Pmr1 function in the same sorting pathway at the Golgi apparatus Pmr1 was first identified in a screen for “supersecreting” mutants based on elevated secretion levels of heterologously expressed proteins ( Smith et al . , 1985 ) . The protein was then characterized as a Ca 2 + ATPase localized to the Golgi apparatus and identified as orthologue of human SPCA1 ( Antebi and Fink , 1992 ; Durr et al . , 1998 ; Ton et al . , 2002 ) . Defects associated with loss of Pmr1 in yeast can be complemented by expression of human SPCA1 in yeast , in - dicating a conserved function in eukaryotic cells for the Ca 2 + / Mn 2 + ATPases of the Golgi membranes ( Sorin et al . , 1997 ; Ton et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , we recently showed SPCA1 functions in a cofilin / actin – dependent sorting mechanism of secretory cargo at the TGN in mammalian cells ( von Blume et al . , 2011 ) . Pmr1 was shown to affect vacuolar protein sorting , and loss of PMR1 and cof1 - 8 show synthetic sickness , which affirms the role of these two proteins in a similar pathway . Moreover , pmr1 ∆ cof1 - 8 double mutants show a more severe effect on the secretion of Bgl2 from the late Golgi membranes compared with that observed in ei - ther of the single mutants alone . Taken alone , these findings are con - fusing , as we would not expect an increase Bgl2 accumulation if Pmr1 acts downstream of cofilin . Similarly , we would expect at least the same defect in Bgl2 transport in pmr1 ∆ cells as is observed for cof1 - 8 . The vacuolar Ca 2 + ATPase Pmc1 forms an essential pair with Pmr1 , indicating that loss of both calcium pumps leads to lethal mis - mainte - nance of overall calcium homeostasis ( Cunningham and Fink , 1994 ; Marchi et al . , 1999 ) . Of interest , it has been shown that a portion of Pmc1 is retained in the Golgi membranes when Pmr1 is not present , and this could account for the mild effect in Bgl2 transport observed in pmr1 ∆ cells . cof1 - 8 and pmc1 ∆ do not show a synthetic genetic interaction as observed in cof1 - 8 pmr1 ∆ cells , although Pmc1 can aid in maintaining Golgi membrane calcium homeostasis and may be able to function downstream of cofilin in regulating sorting of Bgl2 from the TGN , as cof1 - 8 pmr1 ∆ cells showed an increased accumula - tion of Bgl2 compared with either individual mutant . The fact that overexpression of PMR1 in cof1 - 8 cells rescued the Bgl2 secretion defect strongly indicates the involvement of Pmr1 downstream of the cofilin - dependent cargo sorting in the Golgi membranes . It is noteworthy that Pma1 and Bgl2 , which are transported in the same carriers from Golgi membranes to the cell surface , have differ - ent requirements for their sorting : the sorting of Pma1 is pH depen - dent , whereas Bgl2 export depends on Ca 2 + ( Huang and Chang , 2011 ) . This highlights the importance of ion homeostasis in the sort - ing of specific secretory cargo in the late Golgi compartments . Taken together , these new findings suggest that the function of cofilin / actin and the Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 / SPCA1 in secretory cargo sorting in the late Golgi membranes is conserved in eukaryotic cells . The obvious next challenge is to identify events that are triggered by the cofilin - and Pmr1 / SPCA1 - dependent Ca 2 + import into the late Golgi compartments . Does binding of Ca 2 + change the properties of the increased intracellular Bgl2 accumulation observed in pmr1 ∆ cells was slightly significant ( Figure 5E ) . In addition , in the cof1 - 8 pmr1 ∆ cells the accumulated Bgl2 was increased , and this was also statistically significant compared with cof1 - 8 cells alone ( Figure 5E ) . pmr1 ∆ cells display a compensatory increase in PMC1 expression , and Pmc1 localizes not only to the vacuole , but also to Golgi mem - branes , where it aids in maintaining calcium homeostasis in the ab - sence of Pmr1 ( Marchi et al . , 1999 ) . If Bgl2 transport is dependent on proper calcium levels in the Golgi apparatus and these are only partially perturbed in pmr1 ∆ due to Pmc1 activity , then this could account for the milder accumulation of Bgl2 in pmr1 ∆ cells com - pared with cof1 - 8 . The increased accumulation of Bgl2 observed in cof1 - 8 pmr1 ∆ cells indicates that cofilin still functions to regulate calcium homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus in the absence of Pmr1 , and this is likely through the relocalized Pmc1 . In addition , we found that overexpression of exogenous PMR1 in cof1 - 8 cells could re - store the transport of Bgl2 ( Figure 5F ) , further supporting that Pmr1 acts downstream of cofilin in regulating transport of Bgl2 . DISCUSSION Our findings reveal the requirement of cofilin for the secretion of the cell wall – specific protein Bgl2 from the late Golgi compartment . Mutant cofilin ( cof1 - 8 allele ) also affected the sorting of CPY from the Golgi membranes , similar to the finding in mammalian cells , in which cofilin knockdown led to cathepsin D secretion ( von Blume et al . , 2009 ) . Many other proteins were exported from the late Golgi membranes normally in cof1 - 8 cells , although some differences in the rate of transport were observed , again mimicking the observed phenotype in mammalian cells ( von Blume et al . , 2009 ) . As cofilin is essential , we must work with mutant alleles , which obviously retain some function . This may account for the fact that we do not see more protein - sorting events affected in cof1 - 8 cells . The situation is further complicated in yeast , as it is known that they can reroute a number of cargoes between different secretory pathways when one is not available . For example , invertase , which normally follows the HDSV - clathrin – dependent pathway , can be transported by the LDSV when necessary , and similarly , when CPY cannot be transported to the vacuole by the HDSV pathway , it is secreted by the LDSV path - way ( Gurunathan et al . , 2002 ) . We observed a mild defect in the se - cretion of invertase in cof1 - 8 cells , which may be a reflection of this rerouting , as CPY transport was also affected in cof1 - 8 cells . The fol - lowing data suggest a direct role for cofilin in the selective sorting / export of the secretory cargo from the late Golgi compartment : Bgl2 and CPY trafficking is affected in the 1 . cof1 - 8 mutant even at the permissive temperature of 30°C . At this temperature , there is a milder defect in endocytosis , since FM4 - 64 was endocytosed at a normal rate in cof1 - 8 cells , although the steady - state local - ization of the v - SNARE Snc1 - GFP was altered and mostly visible at the plasma membrane . Many of the endocytic mutants have no effect on the trafficking 2 . from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface and display varying Snc1 - GFP localizations , indicating that defective endocytosis cannot account for the sorting defects in cof1 - 8 mutants . The two proteins that show a clear phenotype for transport of Bgl2 are Sla2 and Erg6 . Sla2 and the mammalian orthologue Hip1R have been implicated in export of cargo at the TGN ( Mulholland et al . , 1997 ; Carreno et al . , 2004 ) . Sterols are important for traf - ficking out of the Golgi membranes in both mammalian and yeast cells , and the requirement of Erg6 in Bgl2 export is further proof of this requirement in selective cargo export from the Golgi apparatus ( Proszynski et al . , 2005 ) . Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Cargo sorting at the Golgi apparatus | 2335 specific cargoes and enable their packing into transport carriers des - tined to the cell surface ? Is there a specific protein ( receptor ) that binds specific cargoes in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner and packs them into the budding transport carriers ? What is the precise role of actin in this process ? Is it required for the activation of Pmr1 or generation of a specific domain that sequesters the secretory cargo sorting machin - ery ? Yeast is a good system to search for proteins involved specifically in the export of Bgl2 and could reveal the identity of components of the Ca 2 + - dependent cargo sorting in the late Golgi membranes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Media Yeast cells were grown in rich YPD ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , and 2 % glucose ) or synthetic complete ( SC ) media ( 0 . 67 % yeast ni - trogen base , 2 % glucose supplemented with amino acid drop - out mix from Sigma - Aldrich [ St . Louis , MO ; lacking uracil , histidine , leu - cine and tryptophan ] or Clontech [ Mountain View , CA ; lacking me - thionine ] ) , with required amino acids for auxotrophies and / or plas - mid selection added as required . Yeast strains and plasmid construction Cofilin mutant strains were acquired from David Drubin ( University of California , Berkeley ) and sequenced to confirm the mutation . The cof1 - 8 mutant was not correct upon sequencing , and to maintain isogenic strains a cof1 - 8 strain in the background of BY4741 was ob - tained from Charlie Boone ( University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada ) and used for all analyses ( see Table 1 ) . Strains ACY4 , ACY18 , and ACY19 were generated by homologous recombination of two PCR - generated fragments , one containing 80 base pairs upstream of the cof1 - 8 allele to the STOP plus the beginning of the NatNT2 cassette from vector pYM17 ( Janke et al . , 2004 ) and a fragment containing the NatNT2 cassette plus 45 base pairs downstream of COF1 locus . Frag - ment 1 was amplified from genomic DNA from the cof1 - 8 , KanMx4 strain using primers 5 ′ - GGAAACAAGAAAAGACTGGTTAGCAAC - TAC - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - TAATTAACCCGGGGATCCGTCGACCTGCAGCG - TACG TTAATGAGAACCAGCGCCTCTGCTGACTCT - 3 ′ ( COF1 se - quence in bold ) . Fragment 2 was amplified using pYM17 as template and primers 5 ′ - CGTACGCTGCAGGTCGACGGATCC - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - TTTCATTTTTCTTGAAGATTGTTGTCATTTGTGAAATCATTTAC - C ATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCGATTAC - 3 ′ ( downstream COF1 se - quence in bold ) . Strains were assessed for temperature sensitivity and confirmed by sequencing of the COF1 gene . To construct the COF1 plasmid , wild - type COF1 was amplified from genomic DNA from START to STOP using primers 5 ′ - CTAGCTACTAGT ATGTCTAGATCT - GGGTATGC - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - CTAGCTCTCGAGT TAATGAGAACCA - GCGCCTCTG - 3 ′ ( COF1 sequences in bold ) and cloned into a pRS416 vector containing the ADH1 promoter and CYC1 terminator ( provided by Sebastion Leon , Université Paris Diderot , Paris , France ) using Spe I and Xho I restriction enzymes ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) .

Samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and detected by SDS – PAGE / autoradiography . Bgl2 and invertase labeling and immunoprecipitation These were performed as described in Graham ( 2001 ) . Briefly , cells were grown in SC - methionine at 30°C ( or 37°C as indicated for ts controls ) , and equal cell numbers ( ∼ 1 OD per time point for Bgl2 and 3 OD per time point for invertase ) were labeled with 100 μCi / time point of [ 35 S ] methionine and chased with 50 mM methionine for the indicated times . In the case of invertase , cells were cultured in SC - methionine containing 0 . 1 % glucose for 15 min before and during the labeling . At the indicated times cells were removed and added to 2 × stop / spheroplasting buffer ( 2 M sorbitol , 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 40 mM NaN 3 , 40 mM NaF , 1 mg / ml bovine serum al - bumin ) . After 10 min on ice , 1 μl of β - mercaptoethanol and 30 μg of zymolyase were added , and spheroplasts were generated at 37°C for 20 min with gentle shaking . Cells were separated from cell walls by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min , and cell wall proteins were TCA precipitated . Cell pellets and TCA pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS / urea buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % SDS , 6 M urea ) , incubated at 100°C for 4 min , and 900 μl of IP buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP40 ) was added . Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4°C . Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4°C with 30 μl of Protein A / G PLUS Agarose and 1 μl of Bgl2 ( from Randy Schekman ) or invertase ( from Howard Riezman , University of Geneva , Geneva , Switzerland ) antibody . Immunoprecipitations were washed as described , resuspended in SDS sample buffer , and de - tected by SDS – PAGE / autoradiography . Subcellular fractionation Approximately 150 OD 600 of wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells cultured in YPDA at 30°C were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g , washed once with ice - cold 10 mM NaN 3 / NaF , and further incubated on ice in NaN 3 / NaF . Cells were resuspended at 20 OD / ml in pre - sphero - plasting buffer ( 10 mM NaN 3 , 10 mM NaF , 100 mM Tris - H 2 SO 4 , pH 9 . 4 , 0 . 36 μl / ml β - mercaptoethanol ) , and incubated for 20 min at 25°C . Cells were collected and spheroplasted at 50 OD 600 / ml in spheroplasting buffer ( 40 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethane - sulfonic acid [ HEPES ] – NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , 1 . 4 M sorbitol , 1 μl / ml β - mercaptoethanol ) by treatment with 50 U / OD 600mn zymolyase 100T for 45 – 60 min at 37°C . Efficiency of spheroplasting was monitored by measuring OD 600 of a 1 : 1000 dilution in H 2 O versus spheroplast buffer , with a 10 - fold reduction in OD 600 indicating complete sphero - plasting . Spheroplasts were harvested , resuspended in 1 . 5 ml of ly - sis buffer ( 10 mM HEPES - NaOH , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 3 M sorbitol , pro - tease inhibitors ) , and lysed by 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer . Lysates were cleared twice by centrifugation ( 600 × g for 3 min ) . Equal protein concentrations were loaded on top of a continuous sucrose gradient ( 10 ml of 30 – 60 % sucrose in 10 mM HEPES - NaOH , 1 mM EDTA ) and centrifuged for 18 h at 100 , 000 × g . Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top , and proteins were separated by SDS – PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against Mnn9 ( a gift from Yoichi Noda , University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan ) and Kar2 ( a gift from Mark Rose , Princeton University , Princ - eton , NJ ) . Protein bands were quantitated with the Odyssey 2 . 1 soft - ware for three independent experiments , and the averages were plotted using Prism software ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA ) . Fluorescence microscopy Cells were imaged with a Leica DMI6000B microscope ( Leica , Wet - zlar , Germany ) equipped with a DFC 360 FX camera using an HCX in spheroplast buffer containing 167 μg / ml zymolyase 100T ( Seika - gaku Biobusiness , Tokyo , Japan ) , and incubated with gentle mixing for 30 min at 30°C . Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 × SDS sample buffer be - fore separation by SDS – PAGE and Western blotting to detect Bgl2 ( a gift from Randy Schekman , University of California , Berkeley ) and Pgk1 loading control ( Invitrogen ) . Invertase secretion Invertase secretion was performed using standard methods ( Gold - stein and Lampen , 1975 ) with minor modifications . Yeast cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 30°C in YPD , and equal cell numbers were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min . Cell pellets were washed twice , resuspended in 0 . 1 % glucose YPD , and cul - tured for 2 h further at 30°C to induce SUC2 gene expression . Cells were harvested as before , washed twice , and resuspended in cold 10 mM NaN 3 . An equal cell number was transferred to two new tubes—one containing 10 mM NaN 3 to keep cells intact ( secreted fraction ) and the other containing 10 mM NaN 3 plus 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 to lyse cells ( total internal and secreted fractions ) . In triplicate , equal cell numbers of secreted and total samples were used to as - say invertase activity in 0 . 1 M sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 1 ) . Tubes were equilibrated at 30°C , and 2 . 5 mol of sucrose ( invertase substrate ) was added in timed intervals to start the reaction . Exactly 30 min later the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0 . 2 M sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 0 ) with 10 mM NEM and boiling for 3 min . The glucose produced by the invertase was measured by standard glu - cose oxidase reaction . Tubes were equilibrated at 30°C , and fresh glucostat reagent ( 0 . 1 M potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , 4 . 34 U glu - cose oxidase , 2 . 5 μg / μl , 0 . 1 mM NEM , 150 μg / ml O - dianisidine , and 1 mg / ml horseradish peroxidase ) was added in timed intervals . Samples were incubated at 30°C for a maximum of 30 min ( less , if color change was observed quickly ) , and the reaction was termi - nated with the addition of 12 N H 2 SO 4 before reading absorbance at 540 nm . [ 35 S ] methionine labeling of secreted proteins Cells were grown SC - methionine to logarithmic phase at 30°C ( and shifted to 37°C for 1 h in the case of sec18 - 1 control ) , labeled for 15 min with 150 μCi / ml [ 35 S ] methionine , and chased with 50 mM methionine for 30 min . Secreted proteins in the medium were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) and detected by SDS – PAGE / autoradiography . CPY secretion filter assay Yeast cells were grown in YPD to logarithmic phase , and equal cell numbers ( 5 μl of 1 OD ) were spotted on YPD solid medium ; a nitro - cellulose filter was overlaid for 48 h . Secreted CPY was detected on the filter by Western blot against CPY ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . CPY labeling and immunoprecipitation Cells were grown in SC - methionine at 30°C , and equal cell numbers ( ∼ 1 OD per time point ) were labeled with 100 μCi / time point of [ 35 S ] methionine and chased with 50 mM methionine for the indicated times . Cell lysates were generated in 200 μl of 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM EDTA , and protease inhibitors by glass bead disruption . SDS was added to 0 . 5 % , and lysates were boiled 5 min before addi - tion of 800 μl of IP buffer ( 30 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 120 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . Immunoprecipitates ( IPs ) were cleared by centrifugation at 10 , 000 × g for 10 min , and 35 μl of Protein A / G PLUS Agarose ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) and 2 μl of CPY monoclonal antibody ( Invitrogen ) were added and incubated overnight at 4°C . IPs were washed extensively , first in IP buffer with 0 . 1 % SDS , then in Volume 23 June 15 , 2012 Cargo sorting at the Golgi apparatus | 2337 minor modification ( Luo and Chang , 2000 ) . Cells were grown in re - pressing conditions to logarithmic phase , washed in distilled water , and grown in methionine - free medium to derepress the MET25 pro - moter to allow HA - PMA1 expression . Normally , 600 μM methionine is sufficient to repress the MET25 promoter , but concentrations up to 2 mM were used to avoid the low - level of expression observed in wild - type cells . Cells were fixed for 2 h in 0 . 1 M KPO 4 , pH 6 . 6 , washed in the same buffer , and treated for immunofluorescence as described . The HA epitope was detected with a monoclonal HA antibody ( Covance , Berkeley , CA ) used at a concentration of 1 : 1000 and the secondary anti – mouse Alexa 488 ( Invitrogen ) . Serial dilutions to assess growth Cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 25°C , set to an OD 600 of 0 . 1 , and serially diluted three times . Cells were plated to appropri - ate medium ( YPD or SC lacking uracil or leucine to select plasmids as required ) using a 96 - well replica plate and incubated at the indi - cated temperatures for 48 – 72 h . The PMR1 – expressing vector was provided by Kyle Cunningham ( Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD ) and contains PMR1 under the control of its own promoter cloned in a URA3 - marked 2μ vector . Pl APO 100 × 1 . 4 objective . Images were taken using Leica LAS AF software . Snc1 - GFP and Pma1 - GFP were expressed exogenously from their own promoters and visualized in live cells cultured at 30°C in SC - uracil . The plasmid expressing Snc1 - GFP was a gift from Hugh Pelham ( MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , UK ) , and Pma1 - GFP was kindly provided by Annick Breton ( CNRS [ Cen - tre national de la recherche scientifique ] , Bordeaux , France ) . FM4 - 64 uptake and trafficking were determined as described previously ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) with slight modifications . Cells were grown in YPD at 30°C and directly labeled with FM4 - 64 or shifted to 37°C for 1 h before labeling with 40 μM FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen ) for 15 min ( at 30 or 37°C , respectively ) . Cells were washed and resus - pended in fresh , prewarmed YPD and further incubated at 30 or 37°C for 45 min , and live cells were immediately visualized . Actin was visualized by staining with phalloidin linked to Alexa 488 ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were grown at 30°C in YPD and directly fixed or shifted to 37°C for 1 h . Cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 30 min and washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Fixed cells were permeabilized for 15 min with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS with 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , washed in PBS , and incubated with 0 . 2 U / ml Alexa 488 – phalloidin in PBS with 2 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature . Cells were washed again in PBS and visualized imme - diately or stored at 4°C for visualization later . Immunocolocalization of Bgl2 The immunocolocalization experiments were performed on wild - type and cof1 - 8 cells containing either genomic Anp1 - RFP or expressing exogenously Sec7 - DsRed ( kindly provided by Scott Emr , Cornell Uni - versity , Ithaca , NY ) , mCherry - Tlg1 , or mCherry - Pep12 ( kindly pro - vided by David Katzmann , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) . Cells were grown in SC medium to logarithmic phase at 30°C and fixed for 30 min in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . Immunofluorescence was performed as described ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ) , with slight modifications . Cells were washed twice in 0 . 1 M potassium phosphate ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 1 . 2 M sor - bitol ( phos / sorb ) and resuspended in 1 ml of phos / sorb . Cells were treated with 50 mg / ml zymolyase 10 T and 2 ml of β - mercaptoethanol at 30°C for 30 min . Cells were harvested gently by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min , washed twice , and resuspended in 200 – 500 ml of phos / sorb . Polylysine ( molecular weight , > 300 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) - coated slides were prepared in advance by adding of 10 ml polylysine ( 1 mg / ml ) to the well of a Teflon - printed microscope slide ( Immuno - Cell , Mechelen , Belgium ) , incubating it at room temperature for 10 min , washing it with distilled water , and allowing it to air dry . Sphero - plasted cells ( ∼ 20 ml ) were spotted onto the coated slides and incu - bated at room temperature for 20 min . Cells were permeabilized by immersing the slide in ice - cold methanol for 6 min and ice - cold ace - tone for 30 s . Cells were immediately covered in PBS with 3 % BSA for rehydration and blocking and incubated for 30 min at room tempera - ture . Cells were treated with primary antibody in a humid chamber at 4°C overnight , washed three times for 10 min in PBS , and treated with secondary antibody for 2 h in the dark at room temperature . Cells were washed again three times for 10 min in PBS before mount - ing and visualization . A purified Bgl2 antibody ( a gift from Patrick Brennwald , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC ) was used at 1 : 1000 , and anti - RFP mouse antibody ( Abcam ) was used at 1 : 500 . Secondary antibodies were anti – mouse Alexa 594 and anti – rabbit Alexa 488 ( Invitrogen ) , each used at 1 : 5000 . Images were taken in three - dimensional stacks with 10 – 12 slices of 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 mm and subjected to Leica deconvolution software .
