Weitz , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , and approved August 21 , 2017 ( received for review January 20 , 2017 ) Integrins are transmembrane receptors that , upon activation , bind extracellular ligands and link them to the actin filament ( F - actin ) cytoskeleton to mediate cell adhesion and migration . Cytoskeletal forces in migrating cells generated by polymerization - or contractility - driven “ retrograde flow ” of F - actin from the cell leading edge have been hypothesized to mediate integrin activation for ligand binding . This predicts that these forces should align and orient activated , ligand - bound integrins at the leading edge . Here , polarization - sensitive fluorescence microscopy of GFP - α V β 3 integrins in fibroblasts shows that integrins are coaligned in a specific orientation within focal adhe - sions ( FAs ) in a manner dependent on binding immobilized ligand and a talin - mediated linkage to the F - actin cytoskeleton . These findings , together with Rosetta modeling , suggest that integrins in FA are coal - igned and may be highly tilted by cytoskeletal forces . Thus , the F - actin cytoskeleton sculpts an anisotropic molecular scaffold in FAs , and this feature may underlie the ability of migrating cells to sense directional extracellular cues . cell migration | mechanosensing | fluorescence polarization microscopy I ntegrins are transmembrane cell surface receptors that mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or other cells and signaling that directs proliferation , differentiation , and survival ( 1 ) . Interaction of integrins with ligands is regulated such that high - affinity binding and signaling are induced by extracellular or intracellular cues in a process termed integrin activation ( 2 ) . Ac - tivated integrins localize to focal adhesions ( FAs ) , multimolecular plasma membrane - associated complexes that indirectly link ligand - bound integrins to the cytoskeleton through FA adapter proteins such as talin ( 3 ) . In addition to sensing ligands , integrins sense and promote re - sponses to mechanical cues in a process called mechanotransduction ( 4 ) . Cues include ECM stiffness , tension , or shear force , and can be inherently directional , as with tension and shear , or presented in gradients , as with ECM stiffness . These directional mechanical cues elicit behaviors such as polarization of endothelial cells in response to blood flow or cancer cell migration out of tumors ( 5 – 7 ) . However , how integrins in FAs sense the direction of me - chanical cues is not known . The anisotropic intracellular mechanical environment and shape of FAs may underlie FA sensitivity to directional mechanical cues . The F - actin linked to integrins is anisotropic in its organization and dynamics . In migrating cells , integrins engage to ECM to form FAs at the leading edge , where actin filaments ( F - actin ) orient with their growing ends facing the plasma membrane ( 8 ) . Polarized actin assembly pushes against the membrane , driving F - actin to - ward the cell center in a process termed “ retrograde flow ” ( 9 ) . The forces of F - actin retrograde flow and myosin II contractility are transmitted through FA and integrins into traction on the ECM that drives the cell forward ( 10 ) . The elongated shape of FAs re - sults from force - dependent , directional recruitment of integrins and FA proteins along the axis of retrograde flow ( 8 ) . Thus , polarized intracellular forces mediate FA growth and function in driving cell migration , suggesting that integrins and / or their activation may be intrinsically sensitive to directional force . How could transmembrane receptors sense directional force ? Cytoskeletal forces are thought to provide an ultrasensitive mech - anism for triggering integrin activation by inducing structural transitions between inactive and active integrin conformations ( 11 ) . This model for integrin activation , termed “ the cytoskeletal force hypothesis , ” predicts that directional forces exerted on the integrin β - subunit through a talin - mediated linkage to F - actin would activate and orient integrins with the β - subunit toward and the α - subunit away from the direction of applied force ( 11 ) . This implies a translation of F - actin retrograde flow into a molecular - level , direction - dependent activation and organization of membrane receptors and could underlie the directional mechanosensing of physical cues by integrins . Here , we sought to test whether talin - mediated linkage of in - tegrins to F - actin forces and subsequent activation and binding to an immobilized ligand orients and aligns activated integrins in FAs of migrating cells . We used engineered green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - integrin chimeras and imaging with polarization - sensitive Significance Integrins are adhesion receptors linking cells to their environ - ment , which function as sensors of physical and chemical in - formation to regulate development , immune response , and vascular function . How integrins receive and transduce di - rectional forces including flow or tissue tension has remained elusive . We used polarization - based microscopy techniques to discover that activated α V β 3 integrins are aligned with one another in focal adhesions in migrating fibroblasts . Integrin coalignment is sensitive to mechanical resistance of its ligand and coupling to a dynamic F - actin cytoskeleton , consistent with the “ cytoskeleton force model ” for integrin activation . Our work suggests that activated integrins are actively ordered at the molecular scale by cellular forces , which may underlie their ability to sense directional forces in their environment to me - diate critical functions .

We show that α V β 3 integrins are coal - igned in FAs by F - actin flow , talin , and ligand binding . Rosetta modeling suggests that ligand - bound α V β 3 may be markedly tilted relative to the cell surface . This supports the cytoskeletal force hypothesis for integrin activation and suggests that the highly or - ganized , anisotropic molecular scaffold of FAs may underlie the cells sensitivity and response to directional mechanical cues . Results To test the hypothesis that integrins are aligned in FAs by en - gagement to immobilized ligand and cytoskeletal flow , we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) coexpressing untagged β 3 integrin together with GFP - α V integrin chimeras plated on the α V β 3 ligand fibronectin ( FN ) ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . 1 A ) . To analyze ensemble GFP - integrin organization and mobility , we used emission anisotropy – total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( EA - TIRFM ) ( Fig . 1 B , Top and Fig . S1 ) . Fluorescence excitation is plane polarized so that GFPs whose transition dipoles ( henceforth called dipoles ) are oriented parallel to the plane of excitation will be selectively excited . The parallel ( I II ) and per - pendicular ( I ⊥ ) components of the emission are separated by a polarizing beam splitter onto two cameras ( 12 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . If the GFPs are sterically constrained relative to the integrins and the integrins are immobile and coaligned such that the GFP dipole is parallel to the plane of polarization , the emission of the ensemble , averaged over the diffraction limit and camera exposure time will be collected mainly in the parallel channel , since the excitation and emission dipoles of GFP are nearly colinear ( 13 ) . If the integrins are not immobile and coaligned , or the GFPs are not constrained relative to immobile and aligned integrins , the emission will not be biased to the parallel channel . Constrained GFPs in integrins that are coaligned but not oriented parallel to the excitation axis will be minimally excited . The relative intensities in the parallel and perpendicular channels thus reflect the coalignment and steric constraint of both , integrin and GFP . To quantify GFP - integrin emission anisotropy ( henceforth re - ferred to as anisotropy ) , we defined a microscope coordinate system XYZ , where the Z axis is the optical path , the X and Y axes are in the microscope stage plane , and the plane of excitation polarization is along the Y axis ( Fig . S1 A ) . The anisotropy ( r ) of the emission is r = ( I II − I ⊥ ) / ( I II + 2 I ⊥ ) , where I II is the emission component that is polarized parallel to the excitation , and I ⊥ is the intensity of the perpendicular component ( Fig . S1 B and C ) . We validated results obtained by EA - TIRFM using Instantaneous FluoPolScope where the sample is illuminated with isotropic polarization and anisotropy is determined using detectors sensitive to four different emission polarization orientations ( 14 ) ( Fig . 1 B , Bottom ) . To parse the effects of coalignment and steric constraint on anisotropy of integrins measured with EA - TIRFM , we generated two integrin - GFP chimeras with different degrees of constraint of GFP relative to α V β 3 . In “ α V - GFP - unconstrained , ” the N termi - nus of GFP was fused by a 9 - aa flexible linker to the C - terminal cytoplasmic tail of α V integrin ( Fig . 1 A ) . This allows the orientation between integrin and the GFP dipole to be random such that any measured anisotropy is due to constraint or alignment imposed on GFP and / or integrin by the environment . The second chimera was designed to constrain the GFP relative to integrin ( Fig . 1 A ) , thus reporting on constraint and coalignment of the integrin itself ( 15 ) . In α V - GFP – constrained , GFP was fused in frame to a β - loop be - tween Lys - 259 and Asn - 260 in the β - propeller in the extracellular headpiece of α V , with the unstructured 5 aa at the N terminus and 3 aa in the C terminus of the GFP replaced with a structurally neutral two - residue linker ( Fig . 1 A ) . When expressed in MEFs , both α V - GFP chimeras concentrated at paxillin - mCherry – marked FAs , paired with β 3 integrin ( evidenced by immunofluorescence of α V β 3 with LM609 antibody ) , and had no effect on FA size or number ( Fig . S2 ) . α V Integrins Are Coaligned and Oriented with Respect to the FA Long Axis . We then performed EA - TIRFM imaging to analyze integrin mobility and alignment . We expressed the integrin - GFP chimeras in MEFs and validated that anisotropy in FAs was independent of expression level , FA size , and FA location in the cell ( Fig . S3 A and B ) . We used α V - GFP – unconstrained to analyze the effect of the FA environment on integrin - GFP mobility . This showed that anisotropy was low throughout the basal cell surface ( Fig . 1 C ) ex - cept for within segmented FAs , where it was significantly higher than regions outside FAs ( Fig . S3 C ) .

S3 C ) . Thus , GFP - integrin mobility is constrained in FAs , in agreement with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and single - molecule analyses ( 16 , 17 ) . Next , we analyzed the anisotropy of the α V - GFP – constrained chimera . Similar to the α V - GFP – unconstrained chimera , α V - GFP – constrained showed higher anisotropy inside FA than outside FAs ( Fig . 1 C and Fig . S3 C ) . However , in contrast to the unconstrained chimera where anisotropy was at a similar intermediate level in all FAs , the anisotropy for α V - GFP – constrained was highly variable between individual FAs in a cell , spanning the full dynamic range of the measurement ( Fig . 1 C ) . Thus , integrins in a subset of FAs have constrained mobility and their attached GFPs have their dipoles oriented parallel to the plane of excitation . FAs themselves exhibit an anisotropic shape with the FA long axis generally oriented perpendicular to the leading edge . Examina - tion of EA - TIRFM images of cells expressing α V - GFP – constrained suggested that FAs with similar orientations of their long axes with respect to the excitation polarization exhibited similar anisotropy , implying that integrins may be coaligned with respect to the FA long axis . This , in turn , predicted that α V - GFP – constrained an - isotropy should vary as a function of the angle of the FA long axis with respect to the excitation plane ( Fig . 1 D ) . To test whether integrins were coaligned relative to the FA axis , we fitted segmented FAs with an ellipse , determined the angle of the ellipse long axis relative to the plane of excitation polarization , and plotted average anisotropy in FAs as a function of FA orientation . This “ radial sector analysis ” confirmed that anisotropy varied as a function of FA orientation with respect to the plane of excitation , with peak anisotropy at approximately − 15 to − 30° , and minimum at ∼− 60 to − 75° ( Fig . 1 E ) . The anisotropy vs . FA orientation data were fitted to a cos 2 function that is expected if dipoles are coal - igned and orientated with respect to the FA long axis ( Fig . 1 D and E ) : r = C + A · cos 2 ( γ + θ d ) , where C is the isotropic background ; A , the amplitude of peak - to - peak anisotropy modulation , is directly related to the fraction of sterically constrained and coaligned GFP dipoles ; γ is the angle of the FA with respect to the exci - tation polarization axis , and θ d is the angle of the GFP dipoles with respect to the FA long axis . We validated this approach by performing EA - TIRFM and radial sector analysis of in vitro actin filaments stabilized with Alexa 488 – phalloidin , where the emission dipole is aligned along the filament axis ( 18 ) ( Fig . S1 D and E ) . The FA orientation vs . anisotropy data for α V - GFP – constrained was well fit by the cos 2 function with an amplitude A = 0 . 065 ± 0 . 008 and θ d = − 24 . 3 ± 2 . 86° , suggesting that GFP dipoles on α V - GFP – constrained are coaligned at this angle relative to the FA long axis ( Fig . 1 E and Table S1 ) . In contrast , similar radial sector analysis for α V - GFP – unconstrained or CAAX - GFP showed much lower amplitudes of anisotropy vs . FA orientation data ( Fig . 1 E and Table S1 ) . The orientation of the GFP dipole with respect to the FA long axis of α V - GFP – constrained derived from EA - TIRFM was verified using Instantaneous FluoPolScope ( 14 ) , which indicated a dipole orientation of − 19 . 5° ± 3 . 85° relative to the FA long axis ( Fig . 1 F ) . Thus , α V β 3 integrins are sterically constrained and organized in an anisotropic fashion , coaligned with one another , and specifically oriented relative to the FA long axis . α V Integrin Alignment in FAs Requires Engagement to Immobilized Ligand . To test the role of ligand binding in α v β 3 integrin align - ment , we plated cells expressing α V - GFP – constrained and paxillin - mCherry on either poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) to mediate nonspecific cell adhesion ( 19 ) or laminin that is not an α v β 3 ligand ( 20 ) . TIRFM images of paxillin - mCherry showed that PLL inhibited FA for - mation , although rapid FN secretion by MEFs precluded complete FA abolition , while MEFs on laminin had robust paxillin - containing FA with poor enrichment of α V - GFP – constrained ( Fig . 2 A ) . Immuno - localization of the extended conformation of β 3 integrin with LIBS2 antibody confirmed that PLL or laminin reduced α v β 3 integrin extension compared with FN ( Fig . S4 E ) . EA - TIRFM images of cells on PLL showed that anisotropy was low throughout the basal cell surface , with slightly higher or lower values in remnant FAs , while on laminin , anisotropy was at a high level throughout the basal cell surface , independent of location inside or outside of FAs ( Fig . S3 C ) . Radial sector analysis showed that , unlike cells plated on FN where anisotropy varied strongly as a function of FA orientation , in cells plated on PLL or laminin , the am - plitude of the anisotropy vs . FA orientation data were similar to that of α V - GFP – unconstrained ( Fig . 2 B ) . Our results show that α V integrin alignment in FAs requires specific ligand binding and suggests crosstalk between laminin and FN receptors . To determine whether integrin extension was sufficient for coalignment , cells expressing α V - GFP – constrained were pretreated with 1 mM Mn 2 + and plated on PLL to prohibit ligand binding ( 21 ) . Cells spread and formed large peripheral FAs and small FAs throughout their ventral surfaces ( Fig . 2 A ) , and LIBS2 staining confirmed increased β 3 extension compared with PLL alone ( Fig . S4 E ) . EA - TIRFM and radial sector analysis showed that Mn 2 + treatment and PLL plating reduced the amplitude of modulation of anisotropy as a function of FA orientation compared with cells on FN ( Fig . 2 B ) . Thus , integrin extension is not sufficient for coalignment in FAs . We tested the requirement for ligand immobilization in integrin coalignment by plating cells on supported lipid bilayers function - alized with biotin - RGD ( RGD - SLBs ) as a freely diffusing α V β 3 ligand . Here , α V - GFP – constrained and paxillin - mCherry formed mobile clusters with very low anisotropy , and cells did not spread ( 22 ) ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S3 C ) . Since the long axis of clusters could not be determined reliably , we analyzed anisotropy in clusters as a function of orientation of their closest leading edge ( Fig . S5 ) . This anisotropy vs . cell edge orientation data exhibited a very low am - plitude of modulation ( Fig . 2 B and Figs . S3 C and S5 C ) , although because orientation was not referenced to the polarization exci - tation , θ d was meaningless . Thus , binding immobilized ligand pro - motes integrin coalignment in FAs , but binding to mobile ligand or adopting the extended conformation is not sufficient for alignment .

We next sought to determine the role of F - actin organization and dynamics in integrin alignment in FAs . We first asked whether F - actin and integrin alignment in FAs are related . EA - TIRFM and radial sector analysis of cells expressing α V - GFP – constrained and F - actin stained with Alexa 568 – phalloidin showed that anisotropy vs . FA orientation data for both integrin and F - actin was well fit to the cos 2 function , with different orientations of the dipoles with respect to the FA and greater dipole alignment ( A ) for F - actin than for α V - GFP – constrained ( 18 ) ( Fig . 3 A and B , Fig . S4 A , and Table S1 ) . Plotting anisotropy of fluorescent phalloidin vs . that of α V - GFP – constrained in FAs showed a strong correlation ( Fig . S4 C ) . Thus , α V integrin and F - actin both align at FA . We then tested the requirements for an intact F - actin cytoskel - eton and the talin - mediated link between F - actin and integrins in promoting integrin alignment in FAs . In cells plated on FN , F - actin was disrupted by low - dose treatment with cytochalasin D ( 500 nM , 15 min ) ( Fig . 3 C and D and Fig . S4 B and C ) , while the integrin – F - actin link was inhibited by overexpressing the talin head domain tagged with mCherry ( 23 ) ( Fig . 3 E and F ) . LIBS2 staining showed that , compared with control , disruption of F - actin reduced integrin extension , while talin head overexpression had little effect ( Fig . S4 E ) . SiR - 655 - actin , a far - red F - actin binding probe that has its dipole oriented differently with respect to the actin filament axis than that of fluorescent phalloidin ( Fig . 3 F and Fig . S4 D ) , allowed simultaneous imaging of α V - GFP – constrained , talin head - mCherry , and F - actin . Phalloidin or SiR - actin staining and EA - TIRFM radial sector analysis of F - actin showed that cytochalasin disrupted the cytoskeleton and reduced F - actin anisotropy and its dependence on FA orientation ( Fig . 3 D , Fig . S4 B , and Table S1 ) , while talin head overexpression had no effect on F - actin morphology or anisotropy and its modulation ( Fig . 3 F ) . Despite these different effects on F - actin , both treatments attenuated α V - GFP – constrained anisotropy in FAs and its orientation dependence ( Fig . 3 D and F and Table S1 ) . Thus , although integrins and F - actin both align in FAs , F - actin alignment is not sufficient for integrin alignment . Instead , integrin alignment requires an intact cytoskeleton and is enhanced by the talin - mediated link between integrin and F - actin . We then pursued the role of F - actin retrograde flow in integrin anisotropy and alignment . We first determined the speed and di - rection of F - actin flow in FAs by coexpressing paxillin - mApple and low levels of actin - GFP and performed TIR – fluorescent speckle microscopy ( TIR - FSM ) ( 24 ) . Speckle flow - tracking algorithms ( 24 ) followed by plotting FA long axis vs . local F - actin flow orien - tation showed that F - actin flows along the FA long axis ( Fig . 3 G ) . Together with results above , this shows that integrin alignment is correlated with the direction of F - actin flow in FAs . We next wanted to determine whether F - actin retrograde flow was required for integrin coalignment in FAs . As there is no reliable way to block all retrograde flow or alter its rate without disrupting F - actin integrity , we instead asked whether there was a regional correlation between F - actin flow and integrin alignment . We used the myosin - II inhibitor blebbistatin , which abolishes myosin - II – driven flow in the lamella and FAs , but leaves actin polymerization - driven flow and cytoskeletal integrity in the lamellipodium intact ( 25 ) . As expected , blebbistatin eliminated cell polarity and blocked FA elongation , leaving a rim of diffraction - limited nascent adhesions ( NAs ) in lamellipodia ( 26 ) ( Fig . 3 H ) . EA - TIRFM of α V - GFP – constrained in blebbistatin - treated cells revealed higher levels of anisotropy in NA where retrograde flow remained intact , but very low levels in the cell interior where retrograde flow was blocked ( 25 ) ( Fig . 3 I ) . Since the long axis of NAs could not be determined , we analyzed anisotropy in NAs relative to the orientation of their closest leading edge ( Fig . S5 ) . This anisotropy vs . cell edge orienta - tion data was well fit to the cos 2 function , albeit with lower amplitude than untreated cells , although it had significantly higher ampli - tude than GFP - CAAX , α V - GFP – constrained in cells on PLL and α V - GFP – constrained on supported lipid bilayers ( Fig . 3 J and Fig . S5 B and C ) . Therefore , integrin coalignment in NAs spatially correlates with F - actin retrograde flow . We wondered whether the loss of integrin coalignment induced by plating cells on PLL with or without Mn + 2 or by overexpressing talin head could be due to effects of these perturbations on F - actin retrograde flow . TIR - FSM and speckle tracking analysis of F - actin dynamics showed that , for all three perturbations , F - actin under - went directed retrograde flow at enhanced speed compared with untreated cells ( Fig . 3 K and Movie S1 ) . Together , these results show that F - actin retrograde flow spatially and directionally correlates with integrin alignment and suggests that integrin alignment requires binding immobilized ligand and a talin mediated linkage to a flowing cytoskeleton .

Interpretation of integrin orientation in cells from the experimentally measured GFP dipole orientation in FAs required estimating the orientation of the GFP dipole with respect to integrin in our chimera , then “ placing ” the chimera in the frame of reference of the microscope with the dipole in the chimera ori - ented to match our measured dipole orientation in FAs . Because the measured dipole orientation is a 2D projection on the image plane of a dipole oriented in 3D , multiple orientations of α V - GFP – constrained can lead to a projection compatible with the measured orientation . To constrain the range of integrin orien - tations compatible with the measured orientation , we determined the GFP dipole orientation in FAs for a second chimera in which GFP was positioned differently relative to integrin than that in α V - GFP – constrained . We generated α V - GFP – less - constrained by retaining the disor - dered N - and C - terminal portions of GFP and inserting at the same site in integrin as α V - GFP – constrained ( 27 ) ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . EA - TIRFM and radial sector analysis of cells expressing α V - GFP – less - constrained showed that the anisotropy vs . FA orientation data was well fit to the cos 2 function , albeit with a reduced amplitude com - pared with that of α V - GFP – constrained ( Fig . 4 C and Table S1 ) , as expected from the longer linkers at the integrin - GFP junctions contributing to increased GFP mobility ( Fig . 4 E ) . The dipole was oriented at θ d = − 85 . 5° ± 6 . 3° with respect to the FA long axis ( confirmed using Instantaneous PolScope ) , distinct from the θ d = − 24 . 3 ± 2 . 86° measured for α V - GFP – constrained . To model the orientations of GFP relative to α V β 3 integrin for both chimeras , we used Rosetta ( 28 ) . Integrin and GFP were treated as rigid bodies , and alternative conformations of the connecting segments at the integrin - GFP junctions that produced no steric clashes or strain in the linker region were sampled . Rosetta predicted an ensemble of permissible model structures for each chimera ( Fig . 4 E ) . A reference plane in the α V β 3 integrin was defined by three conserved positions in the integrin headpiece : Asp of the RGD ligand at the origin ; and one at each junction between the headpiece and the α V and β 3 legs . The orientation of the GFP dipole with respect to this plane was calculated for each model structure . This predicted a broader range of possible dipole orientations relative to the integrin for α V - GFP – less - constrained compared with that for α V - GFP – constrained , as expected ( Fig . S6 A ) . To relate the measured GFP dipole orientations in FAs to integrin orientation in FAs , we created an integrin / microscope frame of reference ( Fig . 4 F ) . The X – Y plane was defined as parallel to the substrate / plasma membrane , with the FA long axis aligned along the X axis with + X toward the cell leading edge , the X – Z plane defined by the three conserved positions in the integrin headpiece , and the ligand - binding site pointed toward the substrate in the − Z direction along the optical axis ( Fig . 4 F and Fig . S6 B ) . We modeled the effect of rotating the integrin headpiece and ensemble of Rosetta structures associated with it around the integrin - ligand point in the integrin / microscope frame of reference on the projected dipole orientation in the image plane ( Fig . S6 C and D and Movie S2 ) . We assumed that the integrin was aligned with the line defined by the α - leg junction to β - leg junction along the FA ( X ) axis , as would be expected if tension were applied to the β - leg via retrograde flow . We determined the tilt ( rotation around Y axis ) of the integrin headpiece relative to the membrane that maximized the overlap between the dipole orientations in the projection of Rosetta models and the measured dipole orienta - tions for both chimeras . We found that the maximum overlap is obtained when the headpiece is highly tilted ( φ = 0 – 15° ) toward the membrane plane ( Fig . 4 H ) . Considering our assumptions , the possible caveats of Rosetta modeling , and the broad spread in the possible orientations for α V – less - constrained , we speculate that the α V β 3 integrin headpiece is tilted relative to the membrane - normal ( optical ) axis along the axis of F - actin retrograde flow ( Fig . 4 I ) . Discussion Our results show that integrins can be ordered and aligned by the F - actin cytoskeleton . For decades , FAs have been described as “ clusters ” of integrin that recruit cytosolic FA - associated proteins . However , “ cluster ” implies no spatial ordering of proteins or framework for understanding the sensitivity of FAs to directional physical cues . Unlike F - actin , which is intrinsically ordered , ordering of integrins is actively imposed by extrinsic factors and correlates with conditions favoring directional F - actin motion and tension across the ligand – integrin – F - actin link , suggesting this factor is physical force . This is consistent with in vitro mixtures of F - actin and myosin II on SLBs where self - organization drives anisotropic clustering of membrane proteins ( 29 ) . Our results support a key prediction of the cytoskeleton force hypothesis for integrin activation ( 11 ) : that linkage of integrins to F - actin retrograde flow through an adapter protein and activation and binding to a mechanically resistant ligand should orient and β - prop . βI β subunit αV less - const . α subunit A E C Paxillin aV - GFP - less - const .

We show that alignment of α v β 3 integrins in FAs requires binding to β 3 - specific , immobilized li - gand , and that F - actin alignment in stress fibers is not sufficient for integrin alignment , but requires coupling to F - actin via talin . Local inhibition of myosin - II – dependent retrograde flow in the lamella revealed a spatial correlation of integrin alignment with remaining flow in lamellipodia , supporting the notion that retrograde flow drives alignment . Lamellipodia consist of branched networks in which F - actin has a broad range of orientations relative to the cell edge ( 30 ) , further supporting the notion that integrin ordering in lamellipodia is not templated by F - actin , but rather driven by F - actin flow . Together , this strongly suggests that the talin - mediated linkage between flowing F - actin and activated integrins bound to immobilized ligand actively orients and aligns integrins in FAs . By using different GFP - tagged integrins and Rosetta modeling , our results suggest that activated , ligand - bound integrins are not erect on the cell surface as has been assumed , but may be tilted more parallel to the membrane along the direction of F - actin flow . Tilting of integrins on the cell surface was predicted using molecular - dynamics simulation to model integrin conformations in the presence of lateral forces , and may be allowed by the flexible residues connecting the extracellular domains and transmembrane domains ( 11 ) . The tilt of integrins described here is similar to the tilts of both F - actin and talin in FAs ( 31 , 32 ) , suggesting force coaligns the integrin – talin – F - actin link ( Fig . 4 I ) . Additionally , the coalignment and tilting of integrins is not specific for α V β 3 or other FN binding integrins , as a concurrent study shows a similar orga - nization for the LFA - 1 / α L β 2 integrins in migrating T cells ( 33 , 34 ) . We speculate that integrins are strain sensors whose activation by force lies at the core of FA - mediated mechanotransduction . Integrins that happen to be oriented properly relative to applied force may be “ chosen ” for activation and ligand engagement , while misoriented integrins either remain inactive or , if already active , dissociate from ligand ( 11 ) . This is consistent with the observation that stretch induces disassembly of FAs oriented perpendicular to the strain vector and growth of FAs parallel to the strain ( 35 ) . Such force - induced activation of oriented integrins could mediate di - rection - dependent mechanosensing that promotes cell polarization in response to stretch and / or blood flow in the vasculature . This work with previous studies show that FAs are built on an anisotropic molecular scaffold with distinct protein strata along their 150 - nm thickness that sterically limits the possible interactions between FA proteins ( 36 ) . The architecture of this scaffold pro - hibits a small protein like vinculin from simultaneously binding paxillin near the membrane and F - actin 120 nm away ( 37 ) . Integrin alignment imposes an additional tier of steric regulation by orienting faces of the cytoplasmic tails relative to each other , thus constraining access of binding proteins to dimerization domains or other pro - teins . Force - dependent organization of the FA scaffold may thus sterically dictate specific protein interactions depending on the force magnitude to mediate mechanosensitive changes in FA sig - naling that drive distinct downstream cell behaviors .
