The aim of this study is to identify the network of genes that are associated with CEA - induced colorectal cancer liver metastasis . We compared the genome - wide transcriptomic profiles of CEA pos - itive ( MIP101 clone 8 ) and CEA negative ( MIP 101 ) colorectal cancer cell lines with different metastatic potential in vivo . The CEA - producing cells displayed quantitative changes in the level of expression for 100 genes ( over - expressed or down - regulated ) . They were con - firmed by quantitative RT - PCR . The KEGG pathway analysis identified 4 significantly enriched pathways : cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction , MAPK signaling pathway , TGF - beta signaling pathway and pyrimidine metabolism . Our results suggest that CEA produc - tion by colorectal cancer cells triggers colorectal cancer progression by inducing the epithe - lial - mesenchymal transition , increasing tumor cell invasiveness into the surrounding tissues and suppressing stress and apoptotic signaling . The novel gene expression distinc - tions establish the relationships between the existing cancer markers and implicate new potential biomarkers for colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis . Introduction Intestinal cancers rank fourth in cancer incidence in the world . Despite the improvement of early diagnostics , 20 % of primary colorectal cancer diagnoses reveal remote metastases . Avail - able therapies still offer a poor prognosis and patients have a less than 10 % five year survival rate [ 1 ] . The serum CEA test is recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology [ 2 ] and by the European Group on Tumor Markers [ 3 ] as a prognostic and postoperative PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0161256 September 1 , 2016 1 / 10 a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Bajenova O , Gorbunova A , Evsyukov I , Rayko M , Gapon S , Bozhokina E , et al .

Clinical efficacy of CEA screening has been demonstrated in the follow - up management of patients with colorec - tal , breast , lung , prostate , pancreatic and ovarian carcinoma [ 4 ] . CEA is a large glycoprotein ( ~ 180 kD ) , a member of the Carcinoembryonic antigen gene family and the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gene superfamily and comprises an exceptionally diverse array of highly glycosylated glycoproteins http : / / www . carcinoembryonic - antigen . de / index . html [ 5 ] . CEACAM genes are expressed in multiple cell types including epithelial , endothelial and immune cells such as leukocytes and dendritic cells . CEACAM molecules are generally inserted into the cell membrane via a transmembrane domain or physically linked to mem - brane via glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol anchorage [ 5 ] . Regulation of intercellular adhesion is a major function of CEA [ 6 ] and CEA can establish and maintain tissue architecture and func - tion in the colon . The tumorigenic effects of CEA include inhibiting cell differentiation , block - ing cell polarization , distorting tissue architecture and inhibiting anoikis ( cell death due to the loss of cell - cell contacts ) [ 7 , 8 ] . Nonetheless , the molecular mechanism of CEA related metasta - sis is not well understood . We used 2 human colorectal derived MIP101 cell lines of the same origin with a different metastatic potential [ 9 ] to study the influence of CEA on metastasis . Original low - differenti - ated , poorly metastatic MIP101 cell lines do not produce CEA . The derivative MIP101 - clone 8 was genetically modified by transfection with a construct contaning the full - length CEA gene and a G418 antibiotic resistance selected to express CEA . Here we measured transcriptome differences induced by CEA production in colorectal can - cer cells with differing levels of CEA production and metastatic potential . The RNA sequencing technology ( RNAseq ) allows for the comparison of RNA produced by different cell lines , esti - mation of the level of gene expression , and identification of changes in gene splicing and in the signaling pathways that are involved in response to CEA over - expression . Materials and Methods Cell Culture MIP101 is the CEA - negative cell line and MIP 101 clone 8 is the CEA - positive cell line . Both cell lines are generous gift from Dr . P . Thomas of Creighton University , Omaha , NE . The MIP 101 clone 8 cell line was produced by transfection of MIP - 101 with the full - length CEA cDNA and was selected by culturing the cells in the presence of G 418 ( Thermo Scientific , Lafayette , CA , USA ) . The cell lines were cultured under the same conditions in a sterile incubator at 37 degrees C in a liquid RPMI ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , CA ) medium with supplements on Petri dishes until 70 – 80 % of the confluence . The RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , CA ) medium was supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Hyclone , Thermo Scien - tific , Lafayette , CA , USA ) , 100tte , CA , USAA , ntifiSigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 100Aldrich , St . Louis , MSigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , and 300ich , St . Louis , MOSigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) at 37ldrich , St . Lo 2 atmosphere . Cells were trypsinized and counted . Over 10 million cells from each strain were collected by centrifugation . Two cell lines were cultured in two replicates . RNA Isolation and Sequencing Total RNA was extracted from human colon carcinoma cells using Trizol reagent , according to the manufacturer ' s protocol ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , CA ) and cleared from ribosomal RNA . Poly - ( A ) RNA were isolated from 3 mg of total RNA using Sera - Mag oligo ( dT ) spheres ( Thermo Scientific , Lafayette , CA , USA ) . Transcriptome Analysis of Carcinoembryonic Antigen Producing Cancer Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0161256 September 1 , 2016 2 / 10 Libraries for sequencing were obtained using the Truseq kit , universal adapter sequences , and specific PCR primers , recommended by Illumina . ( Illumina , SanDiego , CA , USA ) . The mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instru - ment at the Broad Institute , Boston , USA . More than 50 M reads were produced for each library with read length of 76 bp . Transcriptome analysis We tested sequence reads using the quality control program FastQC ( http : / / www . bioinformatics . babraham . ac . uk / projects / fastqc / ) [ 10 ] . Reads were cleaned using FAS - TX - Toolkit ( http : / / hannonlab . cshl . edu / fastx _ toolkit / ) to remove the low - quality reads and traces of Illumina adapter sequences . Clean reads were mapped to the GRCh37 human reference genome using TopHat ( v2 . 0 . 9 ) as part of a Tuxedo pipeline [ 11 ] . The expression level for the genes and their isoforms were calculated by Cufflinks and resulted in FPKM values ( fragments per kilobase of exon per mil - lion fragments mapped ) . Differential expression levels between samples were calculated by EdgeR package [ 12 ] , and the p - value was adjusted using the FDR ( false discovery rate ) control method . EdgeR package is based on the statistical method quantile - adjusted conditional maxi - mum likelihood estimator for the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial distribution which was developed for very small sample sizes , typical of those from analysis of gene expres - sion studies with small number of observations ( e . g . 2 libraries for a given experimental condi - tion ) [ 12 ] . The genes were considered differentially expressed between two conditions if they showed a log2 fold - change ratio more than 2 and displayed an FDR - adjusted p - value < 0 . 05 . We identified relevant biological processes and molecular pathways using the Gene Set Enrich - ment Analysis ( GSEA ) tool ( http : / / www . broadinstitute . org / gsea ) . Validation of RNA - sequencing data by qRT - PCR Using the Primer 3 program ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / tools / primer - blast / ) PCR primers were designed to be suitable for all significant isoforms of each differentially expressed gene ; forward and reverse primers were located in different exons of the corresponding gene ( S3 Table ) . The sequences of the selected primers shown in the S3 Table were used , the expression levels of the CEA and GAPDH genes were used as controls for PCR analysis . Each qRT - PCR reaction was performed with three replicates . Results Global Gene Expression Profiling by RNA sequencing To analyze the changes of transcriptome associated with CEA up - regulation , we compared global transcript levels in the CEA - up - regulated ( MIP101 clone 8 ) and CEA negative ( MIP101 ) cell lines using the Tophat pipeline [ 10 , 11 ] . One hundred transcripts of known genes were significantly different in expression . 32 genes were up - regulated and 68 were down - regulated in CEA - producing cells having a fold change in expression > 2 and FDR < 0 . 05 ( S1 Table ) . The top 30 up - regulated and down - regulated genes with an FDR < 0 . 0001 are summa - rized in Fig 1 . Molecular Pathways and Biological Processes Analysis In order to identify putative biological processes affected by changes in gene expression , we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) tool ( http : / / www . broadinstitute . org / gsea ) . 49 biological processes were functionally Transcriptome Analysis of Carcinoembryonic Antigen Producing Cancer Cells PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0161256 September 1 , 2016 3 / 10 enriched including cell proliferation and apoptosis in response to stress and other cancer - related processes .

Table 3 summarizes phenotype - related genes which were selected from the list of differently expressed genes after CEA over - expression . Validation of RNA - seq data by qRT - PCR We performed qRT - PCR to validate RNA - seq technology and bioinformatics methods . Three up - regulated genes ( DSP , PCDH1 and WFS1 ) and two down - regulated genes ( GADD45A and KLF11 ) were randomly selected from the list of differently expressed genes . CEA gene expression was used as a positive control and GAPDH gene was used as an endog - enous control . As demonstrated in Fig 3 , the up - regulation and down - regulation of all selected genes were in accordance with RNA - seq analysis results . The results of classic PCR analysis are presented in S1 Fig . Discussion The steady growth of cancer incidence , increasing survival ages , and high mortality from can - cer metastasis requires the development of more specific and effective methods for diagnostics and prevention of metastasis . Metastasis is the end product of a multi - step , cell - biological pro - cess termed the invasion - metastasis cascade which involves dissemination of cancer cells to anatomically distant organs and their subsequent adaptation to a foreign tissue microenviron - ment . Each of these events is driven by the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations within the tumor cells and multiple interactions between the metastatic population and micro - environment [ 13 ] . Metastasis is a highly specific process . Colorectal cancer cells frequently develop metastases to the liver and lungs , whereas prostate and breast cancers more frequently target the bones as their site for metastasis [ 13 ] . Table 2 .

We discov - ered and cloned the gene for the CEA receptor from the liver macrophages — Kupffer cells [ 15 ] . It has been shown that the CEA / CEAR interaction on the surface of Kupffer cells stimulates the IL1a , IL6 , IL10 and TNF - alpha cytokine production and influences the cell adhesion mole - cules in the liver that enhances the survival and homing of metastatic cancer cells in the liver that trigger metastasis [ 16 ] . In this study we carried out an in - depth analysis on the effect of CEA on colorectal cancer cells . The new information on the gene expression , biological processes and signaling pathways involved in response to CEA were elucidated . The transcriptomic profiling revealed changes in the level of expression for 100 genes ( Fig 1 ) including VEGFA , CXCL5 , TNFSF15 , PCDH1 etc . Previously , we have shown the influence of CEA synthesized by cancer cells on the forma - tion and function of E - cadherin adhesion junction complexes [ 8 ] . These complexes are one of the main contacts between the epithelial cells . CEA disrupts the interactions between the pro - teins that form these complexes : E - cadherin , alpha - and beta - catenins , and catenin p120 . CEA production also changed the splicing variants of catenin p120 protein and triggered the nuclear expression of beta - catenin [ 8 ] . P120 - catenin is a master regulator of cadherin stability and a modulator of Rho GTPase activity . Although p120 - catenin stabilizes E - cadherin at the plasma membrane and promotes cell - cell adhesion , it can also promote cell motility and invasion [ 17 ] . Fig 3 . Validation of RNA - Seq results was performed by qRT - PCR analysis on 5 randomly chosen genes from the list of differentially expressed genes . CEACAM5 also was analysed as positive control . Results obtained by RNA - Seq and qRT - PCR methods show high accordance . Each qRT - PCR was performed with three replicates . All data are means ± SD .

First , CEA receptor protein ( CEAR ) has been described as heterogeneous nuclear RNA - binding protein M ( HNRNPM1 - 4 ) [ 18 ] . This protein belongs to a large family of heterogeneous nuclear RNA - binding proteins ( HNRNPs A - U ) , also called “ histones of RNA ” [ 18 ] . It is an abundant nuclear shuttling protein that has at least 4 protein isoforms [ 18 ] and only 2 transcripts have been experimentally vali - dated : the full - length protein ( isoform 1 ) and the short form ( isoform 2 ) that has a deletion [ 19 ] . We identified the isoform 2 as the CEA - binding protein on the surface of Kupffer cells [ 20 ] . The HNRNPM is a multifunctional protein that is involved in mRNA processing [ 21 ] and splicing [ 22 ] . In human cells , CEAR / HNRNPM plays a role in regulating FGFR2 alternative splicing and can affect the splicing of several other genes [ 23 ] . Post - transcriptional modifications can modulate HNRNPM activity by altering its localiza - tion , its RNA binding specificity , and interaction with other cellular factors [ 19 ] . Generally , HNRNPM has a diffuse nuclear distribution and remains bound to the mRNA as it is trans - ported through nuclear pores . Using isoform specific antibodies , we have shown that in macro - phages and colorectal cancer cells the full - length HNRNPM protein - isoform 1 is localized in the nucleus versus the short isoform 2 , which appears in the cytoplasm and on the surface of the cells [ 20 ] . In support of our data , new evidence has emerged regarding CEA / CEAR signaling pathway activation in the endothelial cells [ 24 ] . Endothelial cells do not synthesize CEA . However , solu - ble CEA , produced by cancer cells , binds with the CEAR receptor on the endothelial cells . Importantly , down - regulation of HNRNPM / CEAR and not VEGF in endothelial cells sup - presses tumor angiogenesis [ 24 ] . Clinical research also shown that up - regulation of HNRNPM / CEAR protein is associated with the aggressive types of colon [ 25 ] and breast can - cers [ 22 ] . Together , these results elucidate a novel function for CEA / CEAR signaling in the tumor angiogenesis and metastasis . Using RNA sequencing we performed KEGG analysis and identified 4 new significantly enriched by CEA over - expression pathways : cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction , MAPK signaling pathway , TGF - beta signaling pathway and pyrimidine metabolism ( see Table 2 ) . The transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) signaling pathway is involved in the control of multiple cancer - related biological processes , including cell proliferation , differentiation , migra - tion , and apoptosis . TGF - β and CEA signaling also induce the epithelial - mesenchymal transi - tion that is essential for metastasis in tumor cells . Recently it has been reported that TGF - β may signal through HNRNPM / CEAR [ 26 ] . The authors suggested that NF - kappaB could be a common point between these pathways [ 26 ] . Our data also show that MAPK pathway is dereg - ulated by CEA overexpression . MAPK signaling pathway is closely related to the TGF - β signal - ing pathway . In this study the large - scale RNA sequencing analysis has provided a wealth of information on the biologically relevant systems that are involved in the response to CEA . We identified the key signaling pathways and proteins that are involved in the CEA - induced colorectal cancer . It represents a major step toward the understanding of the mechanism of colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis . A successful design of novel therapeutic regimens to target CEA producing cancers is only possible if the network - based pathways are correctly identified . Uncovering the underlying molecular mechanisms of CEA / CEAR signaling in angiogenesis and metastasis will lead to the development of new therapeutic possibilities and agents to suppress the CEA expression and to prevent metastasis .
