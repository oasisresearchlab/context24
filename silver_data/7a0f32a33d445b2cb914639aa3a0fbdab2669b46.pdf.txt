Data on contact patterns in Africa , especially South Africa , are limited . We measured and compared contact patterns in a rural and urban community , South Africa . We assessed participant and contact characteristics associated with differences in contact rates . Methods : We conducted a cross - sectional study nested in a prospective household cohort study . We interviewed participants to collect information on persons in contact with for one day . We described self - reported contact rates as median number people contacted per day , assessed differences in contact rates based on participant characteristics using quantile regression , and used a Poisson model to assess differences in contact rates based on contact characteristics within age groups . We also calculated cumulative person hours in contact within age groups at different locations . Results : We conducted 535 interviews ( 269 rural , 266 urban ) , with 17 , 252 contacts reported . The overall contact rate was 14 ( interquartile range ( IQR ) 9 – 33 ) contacts per day . Those ≤ 18 years had higher contact rates at the rural site ( coefficient 17 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 10 – 23 ) compared to the urban site , for those aged 14 – 18 years ( 13 , 95 % CI 3 – 23 ) compared to < 7 years . No differences were observed for adults . There was a strong age - based mixing , with age groups interacting more with similar age groups , but also interaction of participants of all ages with adults . Children aged 14 – 18 years had the highest cumulative person hours in contact ( 116 . 3 rural and 76 . 4 urban ) . Conclusions : Age played an important role in the number and duration of contact events , with children at the rural site having almost double the contact rate compared to the urban site . These contact rates can be utilized in mathematical models to assess transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in similar communities .

BMC Public Health ( 2021 ) 21 : 1055 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12889 - 021 - 11136 - 6 Introduction Contact patterns within communities impact disease transmission and may inform development of interven - tions to reduce transmission [ 1 ] . To evaluate the impact of both pharmaceutical and non - pharmaceutical inter - ventions on disease transmission , mathematical models are utilized when intervention studies may be unethical or too expensive to perform [ 2 ] . Mathematical modelling results are only as reliable as the data used for paramet - rization and the validity of the assumptions made . Dis - ease transmission models usually require accurate age - related contact patterns [ 3 ] . Although sub - Saharan Africa has the highest burden of infectious diseases globally , [ 4 ] data on contact pat - terns within the region are limited , making modelling in - fectious disease transmission challenging [ 5 ] . Contact studies have been carried out in Kenya , [ 6 , 7 ] Uganda , [ 8 , 9 ] Senegal , [ 10 ] Zimbabwe [ 11 ] and South Africa [ 12 , 13 ] . The South African studies were performed in Cape Town communities , and it is unknown how contact pat - terns reported in Cape Town compare to other South African communities . The Prospective Household cohort study of Influenza , Respiratory Syncytial virus and other respiratory patho - gens community burden and Transmission dynamics in South Africa ( PHIRST study ) was a three - year , randomly selected , household - level community cohort study con - ducted at two sites , from 2016 through 2018 [ 14 ] . The primary objectives of the study were to estimate the community burden of and assess the transmission dy - namics of influenza , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , Bordetella pertussis and Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization . To better understand the role of contact patterns on the transmission of these organisms , we nested a contact diary study in the final year of the PHIRST study . We aimed to measure and compare contact patterns in a rural and an urban community in South Africa using interviewer completed contact diaries , and to as - sess participant and contact characteristics that influence differences in contact rates . Methods Study population From August to October 2018 , participants in a pro - spective household cohort study in two sites were in - vited to participate in the contact survey . One hundred and seventeen households , 56 households with 282 par - ticipants at the rural site , and 61 households with 285 participants at the urban site , were included . In short , PHIRST was a three - year household - level community cohort study conducted in a rural community in Bush - buckridge Municipality ( Mpumalanga Province ) and an urban area in the Matlosana Municipality ( North West Province ) from 2016 through 2018 . A random selection of approximately 50 households were enrolled each year from 2016 through 2018 . The rural site formed part of a health and socio - demographic surveillance site ( HDSS ) at the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) / University of Witwatersrand Rural Public Health and Health Transi - tions Research Unit , Agincourt . At the rural site , a list of households with 3 or more members were requested from the HDSS and at the urban site , a list of 450 global positioning system ( GPS ) coordinates within the Jouber - ton geographical area was generated . Households from these lists were approached sequentially and were eli - gible for enrolment if it consisted of 3 or more house - hold members ( sharing at least 4 meals a week ) and > 80 % of household members consented to participant in the study . As part of the main study , households were visited twice weekly for 8 – 10 months for collection of upper respiratory specimens , symptom and healthcare consultation information from all participating house - hold members . Sample size calculations for the cohort study were based on the primary objective that focussed on transmission dynamics of influenza and RSV , and was based on 10 % risk of infection , with 95 % confidence intervals and 5 % precision [ 14 ] . Data collection We interviewed participants of the PHIRST study once to ascertain information on all the persons they were in close contact with for one day . For each participant ’ s contact diary , we collected age ( or age group if age in years was unknown : < 7 , 7 – 13 , 14 – 18 , 19 – 64 , or ≥ 65 years ) ; sex ; if contact occurred in enclosed space or not ; and whether there was physical contact for each person contacted on the day . We also ascertained if the contact was a member of the participant ’ s household ; total time spent with the contact during the day ( < 5 min , 5 – 14 min , 15 – 59 min , 1 – 4 h , > 4 h ) ; where the contact took place ( home , school , work , transport or other ) and how often the participant came into contact with the person ( daily / almost daily , once or twice a week , once or twice a month , less than once a month , or never met before ) . We assigned each household a random day of the week to measure contact events . Fieldworkers visited each household the day prior to the measurement day to explain study procedures to all household members . Fieldworkers informed participants of what information would be collected , provided a blank notebook and pen and encouraged participants to make notes that might be of use during the interview . The day following the measurement day , the field worker visited the household again and conducted an interview with each participant to complete the contact survey ( Additional file 4 ) . A time use survey was completed at the same time to assist with recall of contacts . If the entire household or a Kleynhans et al . BMC Public Health ( 2021 ) 21 : 1055 Page 2 of 10 participant within the household was not available for interview on the selected day , a more convenient day was chosen , based on the age distribution of individuals allocated to the days of the week , giving preference to ensure that there were children aged < 5 years and eld - erly individuals ≥ 65 years allocated to each day of the week . The investigation spanned from 14 August – 14 October and 2 August – 26 September at the rural and urban site , respectively . There were 2 public holidays within this period , which were not investigated for any participants . The school holiday was from 29 September – 8 October , in which period no investigations were done , except for 9 surveys from the rural site performed on the first day of the holiday which fell on a Saturday . We collected both contact events within the household and the community using the contact diaries and cap - tured data on a REDCap database [ 15 , 16 ] . Contact classification and contact rates We investigated contact rate as the primary outcome , which we defined as the median number of people con - tacted per day per group ( based on characteristics of the study participant such as age , sex , etc . ) . A contact was defined as a two - way conversations of at least three words at a distance not requiring voices being raised ( < 2 m between individuals ) , with or without physical con - tact , or where physical contact took place without con - versation . We further classified contacts as physical and non - physical , where physical contacts included kissing , touching , or hand shaking . We analyzed the data using Stata 14 . 2 ( StataCorp , Col - lege Station , Texas , USA ) . We accounted for within - household clustering using the Taylor - linearised vari - ance estimation ( “ svy ” Stata function ) when calculating contact rates . Ninety - five percent confidence intervals for median contact rates were obtained using the ‘ epc - tile ’ function . Stratified contact rates are only presented where data were available for four or more participants within the stratum . Participant characteristics associated with contact rate To assess differences in contact rates based on partici - pant characteristics , or day investigated , we used quan - tile regression , with 500 bootstrap replications and accounting for clustering at site and household level [ 17 ] . Quantile regression allows univariate and multivari - able comparison of percentiles ( including medians ) be - tween groups or categories [ 18 ] . This analytical approach was selected a priori due to the right skewed nature of contact data . Contact events are not normally distributed , but rather follow a power - low distribution where several individuals have few contacts and a few have large numbers of contacts [ 19 ] , making the use of linear regression unsuitable for the analysis of contact events . The quantile regression model outputs a coeffi - cient that quantifies the increase / decrease in median number of contact events for each category of the evalu - ated predictor when compared to the reference category . Predictors were first assessed on univariate analysis , and those with a p - value of < 0 . 2 were included in multivari - able analyses . We did separate analysis for children ( aged 0 – 18 years ) and adults ( ≥ 19 years ) . We assessed site , age , relationship to head of household , sex , if day investigated was a weekday ( Monday - Friday ) or weekend ( Saturday / Sunday ) , day of the week investigated and HIV status . For adults we also assessed education , employment , al - cohol consumption , and cigarette smoking . Backwards elimination was done by excluding categories with the highest p - values until all remaining predictors had a p - value of < 0 . 05 . Age - related mixing patterns and contact characteristics associated with differences in contact rates To investigate age - related mixing patterns , we calculated the total number of contacts each age group had with a specified age group ( < 7 , 7 – 13 , 14 – 18 , 19 – 64 and ≥ 65 years ) and then calculated the proportion of contacts with that age group out of total contacts for the day . To assess differences in contact rates based on the characteristics of the contact ( contact type , contact with a household member , duration of contact , frequency of contact and location of contact ) , we utilized a Poisson model for each age group described above . Lack of over - dispersion was assessed using a negative binomial model , hence a Poisson model was retained for the analysis . Cumulative person hours in contact As a secondary outcome , we estimated the total time spent in contact with persons . We assigned a minute value to each category of total time spent with the con - tact , based on the mid - point for the first 4 categories , and the lower point for the last . We assigned : < 5 min = 2 . 5 , 5 – 14 min = 7 . 5 , 15 – 59 min = 30 , 1 – 4 h = 120 , > 4 h = 240 . For each age category and location , the contact took place we calculated cumulative person hours in con - tact = ( summed total minutes for each contact / partici - pant in age category ) / 60 . Since contact could have been with multiple people simultaneously , the time spent in contact could be more than the 24 - h reporting period . Where more than one location was selected for the con - tact , the time spent counted towards both locations . Results Study population We conducted 535 interviews from August through Oc - tober 2018 , representing 95 % of the 2018 PHIRST co - hort ( N = 565 ) , of which 269 / 280 ( 96 % ) were conducted in the rural , and 266 / 285 ( 93 % ) in the urban site Kleynhans et al . BMC Public Health ( 2021 ) 21 : 1055 Page 3 of 10 ( Additional file 1 ) . The average household size was five in - dividuals at each site ( range 3 – 11 at the rural site ; 4 – 10 at the urban site ) . There were more females ( n = 337 , 63 % ) in - cluded than males . Most adults were unemployed ( 127 / 225 , 56 % Additional file 2 ) . The most common relationship to the head of the household was being their child ( 165 / 423 , 39 % ) , followed by being a grandchild ( 91 / 423 , 22 % ) . Contact rates Overall , 17 , 252 contacts were reported by 535 partici - pants , of which 59 % ( 10 , 304 ) were reported from the rural site . Many individuals reported a low number of contacts and few individuals reported a high number of contacts . The overall contact rate was 14 ( IQR 9 – 33 , Fig . 1 , Additional file 2 ) , with the highest number of contacts from one participant reported as 153 . There were 58 / 269 ( 21 . 6 % ) participants at the rural site and 20 / 266 ( 7 . 5 % ) at the urban site that reported more than 50 contacts for the day . We observed a higher contact rate at the rural site compared to the urban site ( 21 , IQR 11 – 46 vs 12 , IQR 7 – 18 , p = 0 . 001 ) . The highest contact rate was observed in children aged 14 – 18 years , with a contact rate of 22 contacts ( IQR 12 – 91 ) per day ( Fig . 1 , Additional file 2 ) . For both sites , higher contact rates were reported for Wednesdays and Thursdays ( Add - itional file 2 ) . Participant characteristics associated with contact rate Using quantile regression ( median difference ) site , age and day of the week investigated were found to be associated with differences in contact rates for children ( aged ≤ 18 years , Table 1 ) . There was a higher contact rate at the rural site compared to the urban site ( coeffi - cient 17 , 95 % CI 10 to 24 ) . Compared to those < 7 years old , children 7 – 13 years and 14 – 18 years had a higher contact rate ( 9 , 95 % CI 4 – 14 and 13 , 95 % CI 4 – 22 ) . Compared to Saturdays , there were more contacts on Wednesdays ( 18 , 95 % CI 4 – 32 ) and Thursdays ( 12 , 95 % CI 1 – 23 ) . HIV status was not associated with number of contacts for children or adults . For adults there were no factors associated with number of contacts on multivari - able analysis ( Table 2 ) . Age - related mixing patterns and contact characteristics associated with differences in contact rates There was a strong age - based assortment ( mixing ) , with age groups interacting with similar age groups , but also a higher interaction of participants of all ages with other adults ( Fig . 2 ) . Using Poisson regression , we found children aged < 7 years were more likely to have contact with children their own age ( risk ratio ( RR ) 8 . 2 , 95 % CI 5 . 8 – 11 . 6 ) than those aged ≥ 65 years , to have contact with the same people daily ( RR 16 . 1 95 % CI 6 . 7 – 38 . 7 ) compared to once or twice a month , and to have longer contacts ( > 4 h , RR 2 . 9 95 % CI 1 . 9 – 4 . 4 ) compared to those lasting < 5 min ( Table 3 ) . Children aged 7 – 13 and 14 – 18 years had a similar contact profile , except for being more likely to have contact with household members ( RR 1 . 3 95 % CI 1 . 2 – 1 . 4 and RR 1 . 2 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 1 . 4 , respectively ) than Fig . 1 Contact rate by age group , South Africa , 2018 .

Adults aged 19 – 64 years also had shorter contacts and were less likely to see people daily compared to once or twice a month ( RR 0 . 3 95 % CI 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 ) . Adults ≥ 65 years were more likely to come into contact with some - one they never met before ( RR 5 . 8 95 % CI 1 . 8 – 18 . 9 ) than someone they see once or twice a month , and less likely to have contacts at home ( RR 0 . 3 95 % CI 0 . 2 – 0 . 4 ) than in public transport ( Table 3 ) . Cumulative person hours in contact A total of 339 . 8 and 257 . 5 cumulative person hours in contact were reported for the rural and urban site , re - spectively . Children aged 14 – 18 years at both sites had the highest cumulative person hours in contact ( 116 . 3 h rural and 76 . 4 h urban , Fig . 3 and Additional file 3 ) . For children between 7 and 18 years the most person hours in contact were at school ( 75 . 9 – 116 . 3 h ) . Children < 7 years at the rural site spent more time at school ( 47 . 1 h ) compared to home ( 17 . 4 h ) , whereas those at the urban site had 12 . 4 person hours in contact at school and 20 . 0 person hours in contact at home . Adults ( 19 – 64 years ) had most of their person hours in contact at home ( rural 17 h , urban 17 . 8 h ) or another location ( rural 13 . 7 h and urban 11 . 5 h ) . The elderly ( ≥ 65 years ) had the lowest number of person hours in contact of all the ages , most being at home ( rural 13 . 4 h , urban 19 . 8 h ) . The elderly at the urban site had the highest person hours in contact during transport ( 7 . 4 h ) than other ages . Discussion In this study including participants from randomly se - lected households , site , age and the day of the week were independently associated with differences in contact rates in children ≤ 18 years , estimated with contact diary survey data representing > 17 , 000 contacts . We observed higher contact rates among participants in the rural site , among children aged less than 14 years and on Wednes - days and Thursdays . Children reported seeing the same individuals daily , whereas adults and the elderly had more variation in how often they were in contact with the same individual . The difference contact rates observed between the rural and urban site ( 21 and 12 , respectively ) in our study is in contrast to what was seen in Zimbabwe where individuals at the urban site had a greater number of contacts than the rural site ( median of 11 vs . 10 , re - spectively ) . Although the number of contacts at the urban site for both South Africa and Zimbabwe was similar , there was a lower number of contacts at the rural site in Zimbabwe compared to South Africa . This could also be influenced by cultural , household compos - ition and geographical differences between the sites . We observed that these differences were driven by children . The contact rate recorded in a prior study of the Cape Town community in South Africa was more comparable to the rural site , with 20 in Cape Town compared to 21 contacts at the rural and 12 at the urban site in our study [ 13 ] . A contact study performed in rural Uganda found the mean number of contacts per person as 7 , [ 8 ] and in Kenya 18 contacts were observed per day , the trend of having more contacts in a rural setting compared to a semi urban setting was also observed [ 6 ] .

BMC Public Health ( 2021 ) 21 : 1055 Page 5 of 10 the variability that can be observed in contact rates between different settings , and most likely the under - lying culture and social - demographic situation may dictate contact rates , but could also be attributed to differences in study methods . Surveys where partici - pants are informed in advance of information that will be collected generally results in less recall bias , and self - completed contact diaries can allow a large sample size as less interviewers are needed , but have a lower response rate [ 20 ] . We observed a strong age - based mixing pattern as with many prior contact studies , [ 6 , 11 , 21 ] which was most pronounced for the 14 to 18 year old age group . The highest contact rate was observed in children , espe - cially those of primary school age ( 7 – 13 years ) . This also holds true for studies done in Britain , [ 22 ] China , [ 21 ] Kenya [ 6 ] and Zimbabwe [ 11 ] . Certain age groups were also more or less likely to have contact with other age groups , have contact with individuals for certain dura - tions and frequencies and have contacts at certain loca - tions . This information can be useful when looking at targeted intervention strategies to reduce disease trans - mission in specific age groups , for example providing transport for the elderly where safe physical distancing can be practiced . The cumulative person hours in contact was also high - est in children and dominated by school contacts . Schools have previously been described as a focal point for contact and transmission events for respiratory vi - ruses [ 23 – 25 ] . School closure has been shown to reduce influenza transmission – whether done so for holidays or in response to an outbreak [ 26 – 28 ] . However , the im - plementation of reactive school closures is challenging , and comes at a social and economic cost [ 28 ] . Adaption of schools to accommodate physical and social distancing is a promising alternative [ 29 ] . During the coronavirus dis - ease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , school closures were also used as part of a multi - faceted approached to curb the spread of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome cor - onavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , [ 30 , 31 ] although it seems that Table 2 Participant characteristics associated with differences in median number of people contacted for participants > 18 years , South Africa , 2018 Univariate Coefficient 95 % CI Site Rural 2 0 to 4 Urban Reference – Age 19 – 64 years 2 0 to 4 ≥ 65 years Reference – Relationship to head of household Head of home 3 − 1 to 7 Parent Reference – Grandchild 3 − 3 to 9 Child 3 − 1 to 7 Other adult * 2 − 2 to 6 Gender Male 0 − 2 to 2 Female Reference – Type of day investigated Weekend day 2 0 to 4 Weekday Reference – Day of week investigated Monday 1 − 3 to 5 Tuesday 1 − 2 to 4 Wednesday 3 − 1 to 7 Thursday 2 − 2 to 6 Friday Reference – Saturday 4 0 to 8 Sunday 3 − 1 to 7 Education No schooling 2 0 to 4 Primary 1 − 1 to 3 Some secondary Reference – Completed secondary 2 0 to 4 Post - secondary 3 − 1 to 7 Employment Employed 2 0 to 4 Unemployed Reference – Drinking alcohol No 2 1 to 3 Yes Reference – Smoking cigarettes No 2 1 to 3 Yes Reference – Table 2 Participant characteristics associated with differences in median number of people contacted for participants > 18 years , South Africa , 2018 ( Continued ) Univariate Coefficient 95 % CI HIV Status Negative 1 0 to 2 Positive Reference – 95 % CI – 95 % confidence interval * Other adult – Includes relationships of participants 18years and older to the head of household ( n ) : brother ( 7 ) , sister ( 7 ) , wife ( 19 ) , husband ( 4 ) , cousin ( 1 ) , niece ( 4 ) , nephew ( 2 ) , other relative ( 3 ) , not related ( 4 ) Kleynhans et al . BMC Public Health ( 2021 ) 21 : 1055 Page 6 of 10 specifically for SARS - CoV - 2 , schools may not be a specific driver for transmission [ 32 ] . Sex , education status , employment , alcohol use and smoking cigarettes were not found to be independent factors associated with number of contacts in our study . Employment was found to influence the number of contacts in Britain , but was also dependent on type of employment [ 22 ] . A previous study within a South African community in Cape Town found differences in contact rates based on employment status and level of education , although different methods were utilized [ 13 ] . A greater number of contacts was observed for employed individuals , and those with secondary school education [ 13 ] . The high proportion of study partici - pants which were unemployed , and low proportion with secondary education in our study may have contrib - uted to not observing differences between these groups . This also limits the generalizability of our results to other communities . Our study had limitations . Compared to other contact surveys preformed , we had a smaller sample size which could lead to results not being representative for the com - munity . The advantage however is that households were randomly selected . The characterization of contact pat - terns in the PHIRST cohort will also be used in future re - search on influenza transmission patterns in these households . We only surveyed one day per participant and therefore cannot describe variability in day - to - day contacts by individual participants . We used this sampling frame to prevent fatigue and subsequent reduction in re - ported number of contacts as seen in other studies [ 33 ] . We were not able to measure differences in holiday and non - holiday periods . Relationships within the households were complex and capturing function within the house - hold ( breadwinner , child - caregiver , etc . ) might have led to differences in contact rates , but the information was not collected for the PHIRST cohort . As a general limitation of the contact survey , we could have missed some contact Fig . 2 Age - related contact matrix for total number of people contacted , South Africa , 2018 .

BMC Public Health ( 2021 ) 21 : 1055 Page 7 of 10 events , especially in younger children and shorter contacts due to recall bias . We believe by employing the time - use survey to guide participants and interviewers through the day , missed contact events would have been reduced . Conclusions We used contact diaries to describe the contact patterns in a rural and urban South African community . Age played an important role in the number and duration of contact events , with children having the highest contact rates ; most of this contact time occurred at school . Chil - dren at the rural site included in our study had almost twice the contact rate than children from the urban site , and contact rates also differed based on day of the week . Our results , compared to previous studies , highlight how contact rates may differ based on the setting , and this Table 3 Contact characteristics associated with differences between contact rates within age groups , South Africa , 2018 Risk ratio ( 95 % confidence interval ) All ages < 7 years 7 – 13 years 14 – 18 years 19 – 64 years ≥ 65 years Type of contact Physical 1 . 2 ( 1 . 1 to 1 . 2 ) 1 . 5 ( 1 . 4 to 1 . 6 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 0 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 7 to 0 . 9 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 0 ) 0 . 3 ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 4 ) Non - physical Reference Age of contact < 7 years 6 . 1 ( 5 . 5 to 6 . 8 ) 8 . 2 ( 5 . 8 to 11 . 6 ) 0 . 6 ( 0 . 4 to 0 . 8 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 ) 0 . 3 ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 ) 0 . 3 ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 7 ) 7 – 13 years 8 . 5 ( 7 . 7 to 9 . 5 ) 2 . 9 ( 2 . 0 to 4 . 1 ) 3 . 5 ( 2 . 7 to 4 . 4 ) 0 . 4 ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 ) 0 . 2 ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 2 ) 0 . 4 ( 0 . 2 to 1 . 0 ) 14 – 18 years 6 . 7 ( 6 . 0 to 7 . 5 ) 0 . 6 ( 0 . 4 to 0 . 8 ) 1 . 8 ( 1 . 4 to 2 . 4 ) 6 . 3 ( 4 . 4 to 9 . 1 ) 0 . 2 ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 ) 0 . 2 ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 5 ) 19 – 64 years 11 . 9 ( 10 . 7 to 13 . 2 ) 1 . 2 ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 7 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 7 to 1 . 1 ) 1 . 9 ( 1 . 3 to 2 . 8 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 0 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 6 to 2 . 9 ) ≥ 65 years Reference Gender of contact Male Reference Female 1 . 2 ( 1 . 1 to 1 . 2 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 1 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 8 to 0 . 9 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 1 ) 1 . 2 ( 1 . 1 to 1 . 3 ) 1 . 1 ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 5 ) Not reported 0 . 1 ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 1 ) 1 . 4 ( 1 . 2 to 1 . 7 ) 0 . 4 ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 ) 1 . 2 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 5 ) 1 . 3 ( 1 . 1 to 1 . 6 ) NEO Contact is household member No 3 . 9 ( 3 . 7 to 4 . 0 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 0 ) 1 . 3 ( 1 . 2 to 1 . 4 ) 1 . 2 ( 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 8 to 0 . 9 ) 0 . 4 ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 ) Yes Reference Total time spent with contact during the day < 5 m Reference 5 - 15 m 2 . 5 ( 2 . 2 to 2 . 9 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 8 to 2 . 1 ) 1 . 4 ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 1 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 6 to 1 . 1 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 1 ) 0 . 6 ( 0 . 2 to 1 . 8 ) 15 m - 1 h 8 . 7 ( 7 . 7 to 9 . 9 ) 2 . 0 ( 1 . 3 to 3 . 1 ) 1 . 6 ( 1 . 1 to 2 . 2 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 6 to 1 . 1 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 7 to 0 . 9 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 3 to 2 . 2 ) 1 - 4hts 16 . 8 ( 14 . 8 to 19 . 1 ) 2 . 9 ( 1 . 9 to 4 . 5 ) 2 . 5 ( 1 . 8 to 3 . 5 ) 0 . 6 ( 0 . 5 to 0 . 8 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 4 to 0 . 6 ) 0 . 7 ( 0 . 3 to 1 . 7 ) > 4 h 22 . 1 ( 19 . 5 to 25 . 0 ) 2 . 9 ( 1 . 9 to 4 . 4 ) 2 . 3 ( 1 . 6 to 3 . 2 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 7 to 1 . 3 ) 0 . 4 ( 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 2 to 1 . 3 ) Frequency of contact Daily / almost daily 34 . 6 ( 30 . 8 to 38 . 8 ) 16 . 1 ( 6 . 7 to 38 . 7 ) 8 . 9 ( 4 . 9 to 16 . 1 ) 1 . 4 ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 ) 0 . 3 ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 3 to 2 . 7 ) Once or twice a week 5 . 7 ( 5 . 1 to 6 . 5 ) 5 . 5 ( 2 . 2 to 13 . 3 ) 4 . 4 ( 2 . 4 to 8 . 1 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 9 ) 0 . 7 ( 0 . 6 to 0 . 8 ) 2 . 4 ( 0 . 8 to 7 . 9 ) Once or twice a month Reference < 1 a month 0 . 7 ( 0 . 6 to 0 . 9 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 2 to 3 . 5 ) 0 . 4 ( 0 . 1 to 1 . 3 ) No observations 1 . 2 ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 4 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 0 to 4 . 4 ) Never met before 1 . 8 ( 1 . 6 to 2 . 1 ) 3 . 9 ( 1 . 5 to 10 . 0 ) 4 . 5 ( 2 . 4 to 8 . 4 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 7 to 0 . 9 ) 5 . 8 ( 1 . 8 to 18 . 9 ) Location of contact Home 3 . 6 ( 3 . 3 to 3 . 9 ) 1 . 2 ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 ) 2 . 1 ( 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ) 1 . 1 ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 5 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 7 to 0 . 9 ) 0 . 3 ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 4 ) School 8 . 2 ( 7 . 7 to 8 . 8 ) 1 . 5 ( 1 . 2 to 1 . 8 ) 3 . 7 ( 2 . 8 to 4 . 9 ) 2 . 6 ( 2 . 0 to 3 . 5 ) 0 . 1 ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 1 ) No observations Work 0 . 8 ( 0 . 7 to 0 . 8 ) No observations 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 to 0 . 1 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 to 0 . 1 ) 2 . 0 ( 1 . 7 to 2 . 3 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 to 0 . 1 ) Transport Reference Other 5 . 1 ( 4 . 7 to 5 . 5 ) 0 . 8 ( 0 . 6 to 1 . 0 ) 2 . 2 ( 1 . 7 to 2 . 9 ) 1 . 2 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 7 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 1 ) 0 . 1 ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 1 ) Cells indicate risk ratio with 95 % confidence interval in parenthesis .

BMC Public Health ( 2021 ) 21 : 1055 Page 8 of 10 could influence results when building transmission models . These data will be useful when building infectious disease models in similar communities to assess transmis - sion dynamics and possible intervention strategies . A specific approach to explore would be interventions to reduce contacts , and therefore disease transmission , within schools .
