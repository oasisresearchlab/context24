This large and tightly regulated multi - protein complex links the centromeric chromatin to the microtubules attached to the spindle pole body and as such leads the segregation process . Understanding the architecture , function and regulation of this vital complex is therefore essential . However , due to its complexity and dynamics , only its individual subcomplexes could be studied in high - resolution structural detail so far . In this study we construct a nanometer - precise in situ map of the human - like regional kinetochore of Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( S . pombe ) using multi - color single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) . We measure each kinetochore protein of interest ( POI ) in conjunction with two reference proteins , cnp1 CENP - A at the centromere and sad1 at the spindle pole . This arrangement allows us to determine the cell cycle and in particularly the mitotic plane , and to visualize individual centromere regions separately . From these data , we determine protein distances within the complex using Bayesian inference , establish the stoichiometry of each POI for individual chromosomes and , consequently , build an in situ kinetochore model for S . pombe with so - far unprecedented precision . Being able to quantify the kinetochore proteins within the full in situ kinetochore structure , we provide valuable new insights in the S . pombe kinetochore architecture . 2 Introduction The proper segregation of chromosomal DNA during cell division is one of the most crucial processes in the cell cycle of living organisms . Aneuploidy , caused by chromosome maldistribution , leads to cancer , birth defects and cell death ( Pfau and Amon , 2012 ; Santaguida and Amon , 2015 ; Yuen et al . , 2005 ) . During chromosome segregation , sister chromatids are separated by the microtubules of the spindle apparatus . Here , the kinetochore , a multiprotein complex , acts as the link between the centromeric DNA and the microtubules emerging from the spindle ( Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ; Roy et al . , 2013 ) . In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the kinetochore appears as a structure of about 126 nm in diameter containing a large central hub surrounded by multiple outer globular domains ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . A single kinetochore connects one single microtubule to a 125 base - pair region , a so - called point centromere of defined sequence ( Clarke , 1998 ; Winey et al . , 1995 ) . In contrast , in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , the kinetochore complex links 2 - 4 kinetochore microtubules ( kMTs ) to a regional centromere in the kilobase - pair range ( Chikashige et al . , 1989 ; Ding et al . , 1993 ) . In higher eukaryotes , the structure is even more extensive . For example , for human chromosomes , the centromeric region spans 0 . 5 - 1 . 5 megabase pairs and is built in ùõÇ - satellite repeats ( Wevrick and Willard , 1989 ; Zinkowski et al . , 1991 ) . Accordingly , the human kinetochore structure allows attachment to approximately 20 kMTs ( McEwen et al . , 1998 ; McEwen et al . , 1997 ) . Despite these differences in centromere length and number of kMTs , the general kinetochore architecture is highly conserved ( Drinnenberg et al . , 2016 ; van Hooff et al . , 2017 ) . The position of the centromeric region is epigenetically defined by a H3 histone variant , cnp1 CENP - A , which replaces one or both H3 proteins in the centromeric nucleosomes ( Dunleavy et al . , 2011 ; Lando et al . , 2012 ) . ( In this report , the terminology of S . pombe is used , with the human homolog in superscript , if different . ) cnp1 CENP - A provides the scaffolding for the assembly of the kinetochore , which consists of several subcomplexes : the CCAN network , the Mis12 / MIND complex , the KNL1 complex , the NDC80 complex and the DAM1 / DASH complex ( or Ska complex in humans ) ( Kixmoeller et al . , 2020 ; Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) . The structures of these subcomplexes have been made available by cryo - EM and x - ray crystallography studies , e . g . the structures of the CENH3 nucleosome ( Migl et al . , 2020 ; Tachiwana et al . , 2011 ) , the CCAN network ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019a ; Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019b ; Yan et al . , 2019 ) , the MIND / Mis12c ( Dimitrova et al . , 2016 ; Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) , the NDC80c ( Ciferri et al . , 2008 ; Valverde et al . , 2016 ) and the Dam1 / DASH complex ( Jenni and Harrison , 2018 ) . Nevertheless , despite recent advances in reconstituting large sub - complexes , e . g . success in resolving the structure of the 13 - subunit Ctf19c / CCAN with a 4 √Ö resolution in vitro ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019a ) , the assignment of kinetochore elements to 3 specific subcomplexes within the fully assembled kinetochore structure has not been successful so far ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ; Walstein et al . , 2021 ) . Fluorescence microscopy can visualize selected proteins of interest ( POIs ) using fluorescent labels such as fluorescent proteins ( FPs ) ( Tsien , 1998 ) . Fluorescent labels can be used quantitatively and as such can yield kinetochore protein copy numbers ( Coffman et al . , 2011 ; Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ; Joglekar et al . , 2008 ; Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Johnston et al . , 2010 ; Lawrimore et al . , 2011 ; Schittenhelm et al . , 2010 ; Suzuki et al . , 2015 ) or intra - complex distances ( Aravamudhan et al . , 2014 ; Haase et al . , 2013 ; Joglekar et al . , 2009 ; Schittenhelm et al . , 2007 ; Suzuki et al . , 2014 ; Suzuki et al . , 2018 ; Wan et al . , 2009 ) . However , the spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy is not sufficient to resolve individual kinetochores ( Tournier et al . , 2004 ) . Here , super - resolution microscopy ( SRM ) bridges the resolution gap between conventional fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy . The kinetochore has been studied by structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2019 ; Schubert et al . , 2020 ; Venkei et al . , 2012 ; Wynne and Funabiki , 2016 ; Zielinska et al . , 2019 ) and by stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy ( Drpic et al . , 2018 ; Zielinska et al . , 2019 ) . Both SRM techniques provided detailed pictures of the structure at about 100 nm resolution . Only a handful of studies have been carried out at single molecule resolution , so far . Two in situ studies each target a single kinetochore POI , cnp1 CENP - A ( Lando et al . , 2012 ) and Ndc80 ( Wynne and Funabiki , 2016 ) , and one study focuses on two - color POI pairs in vitro ( Ribeiro et al . , 2010 ) . In this study , we investigate the architecture of the regional kinetochore of the fission yeast S . pombe . We created a triple - color S . pombe strain library of fluorescent fusions of key proteins of the inner and outer kinetochore . Using quantitative multi - color single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) imaging and Bayesian inference , we report in situ inner - kinetochore distances to the centromere as well as protein copy numbers per centromeric cluster for each POI imaged . With those numbers at hand , we can determine the protein architecture of the kinetochore during mitosis and build an in situ kinetochore model at a nanometer resolution . Our study confirms in vitro studies on reconstituted kinetochore subcomplexes and adds new S . pombe specific insights to our current kinetochore architecture knowledge . 4 Materials and methods Strain construction To construct a dual - color reference strain with both a reference at the centromere and at the spindle pole body ( SPB ) , we added a spindle reference to the S . pombe strain DL70 , which already carries a PAmCherry1 - cnp1 CENP - A N - terminal fusion ( Lando et al . , 2012 ) . To tag the SPB protein sad1 with mScarlet - I ( Bindels et al . , 2017 ) at its C - terminus , we adapted a cloning strategy from Hayashi et al . ( Hayashi et al . , 2009 ) : DL70 cells were made chemically competent ( Frozen - EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit , Zymo Research , # T2001 ) and were transformed with a linear DNA fragment consisting of the mScarlet - I sequence and a hygromycin resistance cassette flanked by 500 - 600 bp of homology arms on both sides for homologous recombination into the genome downstream of the native sad1 gene . Additionally , we inserted the terminator ADH1 from S . cerevisiae ( Curran et al . , 2013 ) between POI - FP and resistance genes to ensure native protein expression independent from the resistance gene . Cells were streaked on a YES agar plate , incubated overnight at 32¬∞C and replica - plated on a YES agar plate containing 100 mg / L hygromycin B ( Roche , # 10843555001 ) . The hygromycin plates were incubated for 1 - 2 days at 32¬∞C until colonies had formed . Colonies were checked for successful integration of the mScarlet - I ADH1 hygromycin cassette by colony PCR and subsequent sequencing . When we tested the resulting strain SP129 for single - molecule imaging , we noted a high level of autofluorescence that we could attribute to an accumulating precursor in the interrupted adenine biosynthesis pathway due to the ade6 - 210 mutation , which is as bright as the single - molecule FP intensities and therefore severely compromises the SMLM read - out ( Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Text S1 ) ( Allshire , 1995 ; Levenberg and Buchanan , 1957 ; Lukens and Buchanan , 1959 ) . We thus repaired the ade6 gene using a wildtype strain template . Transformed cells were streaked on EMM 5S agar plates and grown overnight at 32¬∞C , replica - plated on EMM agar plates containing 225 mg / L of histidine , leucine , lysine and uracil each , but only 10 mg / L of adenine and incubated for 1 - 2 days at 32¬∞C . Cells that still possessed the truncated ade6 gene turned pink due to accumulation of the precursor ( which is also used as a selection marker in the literature ( Allshire , 1995 ) ) . Colonies with a successfully integrated wildtype ade6 gene stayed white and were checked by sequencing . This new strain ( SP145 ) was used as the parent strain for the construction of a three - color kinetochore library : Here , each POI was tagged with the FP mEos3 . 2 - A69T using the same procedure as for sad1 - tagging but using a kanamycin resistance cassette ( Supplementary Figure S2 a ) . Successful transformants were selected on YES agar plates containing 100 mg / L geneticin ( Roche , # 4727894001 ) and checked with colony PCR and sequencing . Sequencing was done with the Mix2Seq kit ( Eurofins Genomics , 5 Germany ) . A colony was picked for each newly generated strain , cultured to early stationary phase in rich YES medium , mixed in a 1 : 1 ratio with sterile 87 % glycerol and stored at - 80¬∞C . All strains used in this study can be found in Supplementary Table S1 and all primers used for strain construction can be found in Supplementary Table S2 . Spot tests To assess the effect of the FP tags on the POIs and reference proteins , spot tests were conducted to compare the temperature and thiabendazole ( TBZ , inducing mitotic defects by microtubule depolymerization ) sensitivity to the parental h + WT strain ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . For this , S . pombe strains from cryostocks were streaked on YES agar plates and incubated at 32¬∞C for two days . After growing the overnight cultures in YES medium at 25¬∞C to an OD 600 of 1 - 2 , all cultures were adjusted to an OD 600 of 1 . 0 and 2 ¬µL each of a serial dilution of 1 : 1 , 1 : 10 , 1 : 100 and 1 : 1000 were plated either on YES agar plates and incubated at 25 , 32 or 37¬∞C for three days for temperature sensitivity testing , or on YES agar plates containing 2 . 5 , 5 . 0 , 7 . 5 or 10 . 0 ¬µg / mL TBZ ( Cayman Chemical Company , # 23391 ) and incubated at 25¬∞C for three days . Flow Cytometry To assess the effect of the fluorescent protein tags on the phenotype of cells , flow cytometry was conducted ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Cells were streaked from cryostocks on YES agar plates and grown at 32¬∞C for 2 - 3 days until colonies were visible . A single colony was picked , inoculated in 10 mL rich YES medium and grown overnight ( 25¬∞C , 180 rpm ) . Subsequently , the OD 600 for each strain was measured and an appropriate cell amount was used to inoculate 10 mL of EMM 5S to the same starting OD 600 . Cells were grown overnight ( 25¬∞C , 180 rpm ) and the OD 600 was measured again the next morning to verify that cells were in logarithmic growth phase . Light scattering ( FSC and SSC ) was measured with a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Germany ) . Before each measurement , samples were mixed thoroughly to disperse cell aggregates . For each strain , 10 . 000 cells were recorded using the FACSDiva software ( BD Biosciences , Germany ) . Data was analyzed and plotted with the software FlowJo ( BD Biosciences , Germany ) . Sample preparation for SMLM imaging After streaking S . pombe strains from cryostocks on YES agar plates and incubating them at 32¬∞C until colonies were visible , overnight cultures were inoculated in rich YES media at 25¬∞C and grown to an OD 600 of 1 - 2 . Next , 2x 50 mL night cultures were inoculated in freshly prepared 6 EMM 5S media starting at OD 600 0 . 1 and grown at 25¬∞C for around 16 h to OD 600 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 . Cultures were centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 25¬∞C for 5 min , the supernatant was discarded , and the pellets were resuspended in 200 ¬µL fresh EMM 5S each . Meanwhile , for cell synchronization , two previously prepared and frozen 15 mL falcons containing 20 % lactose ( Carl Roth # 6868 . 1 ) were thawed at 30¬∞C and the cell suspension was carefully added on top of the still cold lactose gradient ( Supplementary Figure S2 b ) . The falcons were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 8 min and 1 mL of the resulting upper cell layer , which consists of cells in early G2 stage , was extracted , added to 1 mL fresh EMM 5S and centrifuged at 4000 x g for 1 min . The pellets were resuspended in 500 ¬µL EMM 5S , combined and the OD 600 was measured . The cell suspension was inoculated in fresh EMM 5S at a starting OD 600 of 0 . 6 and grown for 60 , 70 or 80 min at 25¬∞C . At each time point , 2 mL aliquots were taken from the main culture for chemical fixation with 3 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA , Sigma - Aldrich , # F8775 ) at 20 min at RT . The fixed cells were centrifuged at 4000xg for 2 min and washed six times with 1 mL washing buffer alternating between 1xPBS , pH 7 . 5 ( Gibco , # 70011 - 036 ) and 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 5 ( Carl Roth , # AE15 . 2 ) with each 10 min of incubation . The cells were resuspended in 500 ¬µL Tris - HCl after the last wash , a 1 : 1000 dilution of previously sonicated dark red ( 660 / 680 ) FluoSpheres ( Molecular probes , # F8807 ) was added to serve as fiducial markers for drift correction ( Balinovic et al . , 2019 ) and incubated for 10 min in the dark . Ibidi 8 - well glass bottom slides ( Ibidi , # 80827 ) were cleaned by incubating 1M KOH for 30 min , coated with poly - L - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich , # P8920 - 100ML ) for 20 min and air dried thereafter . Next , 200 ¬µL of the bead / cell mix were added to each well and were incubated for 10 min in the dark . Meanwhile , a 0 . 5 % w / v low gelling agarose solution ( Sigma - Aldrich , # A9414 - 100G ) was melted in 50 mM Tris - HCl at 70¬∞C for 1 - 2 min , a 1 : 1000 dilution of dark red ( 660 / 680 ) FluoSpheres was added , and the mix was kept at 32¬∞C until further use . The supernatant of the bead / cell mix incubating in the Ibidi 8 - well glass bottom slide was carefully removed on ice and six drops of the agarose mix were carefully added on each well and incubated for 5 min for proper gelation . Finally , 200 ¬µL 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 5 were added to each well . Samples were stored at 4¬∞C for a maximum of one day until being imaged . Microscope setup and SMLM Imaging A custom built setup based on an automated Nikon Ti Eclipse microscopy body including suitable dichroic and emission filters for SMLM imaging using Photoactivated Localization Microscopy imaging by primed photoconversion ( PC - PALM ) ( ET dapi / Fitc / cy3 dichroic , ZT405 / 488 / 561rpc rejection filter , ET610 / 75 bandpass , all AHF Analysentechnik , Germany ) and a CFI Apo TIRF 100√ó oil objective ( NA 1 . 49 , Nikon ) was used for multi - color imaging experiments as described earlier ( Virant et al . , 2017 ) . The Perfect Focus System ( PFS , Nikon , 7 Germany ) was utilized for z - axis control and all lasers ( 405 nm OBIS , 488 nm Sapphire LP , 561 nm OBIS , Coherent Inc . USA ) except the 730 nm laser ( OBIS , Coherent Inc . USA ) were modulated by an acousto - optical tunable filter ( AOTF ) ( TF525 - 250 - 6 - 3 - GH18 , Gooch and Housego , USA ) in combination with the ESio AOTF controller ( ESImaging , UK ) . Single - molecule fluorescence was detected using an emCCD camera ( iXON Ultra 888 , Andor , UK ) at a pixel size of 129 nm and the image acquisition was controlled by a customized version of ¬µManager ( Edelstein et al . , 2010 ) . Movie acquisition of all triple - color strains was performed sequentially in HILO mode ( Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ) . First , the sample was illuminated at low intensity 561 nm with 0 . 1 - 1 W * cm - 2 at the sample level to identify fields of view containing a good number of cells with two SPB spots ( metaphase and early anaphase A cells ) aligned in parallel to the focal plane . The sad1 - mScarlet - I signal was read - out by taking 100 images of 60 ms exposure time with the 561 nm laser at 200 W * cm - 2 ( at the sample level ) . Residual mScarlet - I signal was photobleached using 1 kW * cm - 2 of 561 nm laser light for 30 - 60 s . Next , the green - to - red photoconvertible FP mEos3 . 2 - A69T was imaged in the same spectral channel using primed photoconversion by illuminating the sample with 488 ( at every 10th frame ) and continuous 730 nm laser light ( 6 - 70 & 450 W * cm - 2 respectively ) and read - out by 561 nm at 1 kW * cm - 2 for 15 . 000 frames of 60 ms exposure . An additional post - bleaching step with 488 nm laser light ( 210 W * cm - 2 for 20 s ) was performed to ensure that no residual mEos3 . 2 - A69T signal was detected in the next acquisition step . Finally , PAmCherry1 - cnp1 CENP - A was photoactivated by illumination with 10 - 20 W * cm - 2 of 405 nm laser light and read - out by 561 nm at 1 kW * cm - 2 for 10 . 000 frames of 60 ms exposure . Keeping the field of view well defined , we ensured homogeneous illumination . Staining of samples with organic dyes The construction of the N - terminal Halo - cnp1 strain is described in ( Vojnovic , 2016 ) . An overnight Halo - cnp1 YES culture was harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in fresh YES and fixed with 3 . 7 % PFA at room temperature ( RT ) for 10 min . Afterwards , the sample was washed 3x and residual PFA was quenched using 1x PEM ( 100 mM PIPES ( Sigma - Aldrich , # P1851 - 100G ) , pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA ( Sigma - Aldrich , # EDS - 100G ) , 1 mM MgSO 4 ( Sigma - Aldrich , # M2643 - 500G ) ) containing 50 mg / mL NH 4 Cl ( Carl Roth , # P726 . 1 ) . Next , the sample was permeabilized using 1 . 25 mg / mL Zymolyase ( MP Biomedicals , # 320921 ) in 1x PEM at 37¬∞C for 10 min and subsequently washed 3x with 1x PEM for 10 min . The sample was incubated using a few drops of Image - iT FX signal enhancer ( Invitrogen , # I36933 ) at RT for 1 h to prevent non - specific staining and afterwards stained with 50 nM Halo - CF647 in PEMBAL buffer ( 1x PEM containing 3 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich , # A8549 - 10MG ) , 0 . 1 % NaN 3 ( Carl Roth , 8 # 4221 . 1 ) , 100 mM lysine hydrochloride ( Sigma - Aldrich , # L5626 ) ) at RT for 3 h . The stained cells were then washed four times for 10 min with alternating 1x PEM and 1x PBS and incubated at RT for 15 min on a previously washed and with poly - L - lysine coated Ibidi 8 - well glass bottom slide . Finally , the attached cells were washed twice with 1x PEM for 10 min . SMLM imaging and post - processing of dye - stained samples The stained Halo - cnp1 strains were imaged in a redox buffer ( 100 mM MEA ( Sigma - Aldrich , # MG600 - 25G ) with an oxygen scavenger system ( van de Linde et al . , 2011 ) in 1x PEM ) and illuminated with a 637 nm laser ( OBIS , Coherent Inc . USA ) at 1 . 4 kW * cm - 2 at the sample level with an exposure time of 50 ms for 10 . 000 frames on the same setup as described before , except that a different dichroic ( ZET 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 , Chroma ) and longpass filter ( 655 LP , AHF ) were used . Single - molecule localizations were obtained by the open - source software Rapidstorm 3 . 2 ( Wolter et al . , 2012 ) . In order to track localizations that appeared in several frames and thus belong to the same emitting molecule , the NeNA localization precision value ( Endesfelder et al . , 2014 ) was calculated in the open - source software Lama ( Malkusch and Heilemann , 2016 ) . Reconstruction of SMLM images For visualization , we aimed to reconstruct SMLM images that neither over - nor under - interpret the resolution of the SMLM data and resemble fluorescence images as closely as possible . Localizations were tracked together using the Kalman tracking filter in Rapidstorm 3 . 2 with two sigma , and the NeNA value used as sigma ( dSTORM data ) , or using kd - tree tracking ( 3D - color strain library data , described in detail in the data analysis section below ) . Images were then reconstructed in Rapidstorm 3 . 2 or 3 . 3 with a pixel size of 10 nm . Rapidstorm linearly interpolates the localizations and fills neighboring pixels based on the distance between the localization and the center of the main subpixel bin to avoid discretization errors ( Wolter et al . , 2012 ) . These images were then processed with a Gaussian blur filter based on their NeNA localization uncertainty in the open - source software ImageJ 1 . 52p ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Importantly , images were only used for image representation purposes , all data analysis steps were conducted on the localization data directly ( see data analysis ) . Construction of the FtnA protein standard The pRSETa - FtnA backbone was amplified from pRSETa BC2 - Ypet - FtnA ( Virant et al . , 2018 ) , the mEos3 . 2 - A69T fragment was amplified from pRSETa - mEos3 . 2 - A69T ( Turkowyd et al . , 2017 ) with a 18 and 23 bp overlap to the pRSETa - FtnA backbone respectively . Purified DNA fragments ( Clean & Concentrator - 5 Kit , Zymo Research , # D4013 ) were merged by Overlap - 9 Extension PCR in a 1 : 2 ratio of backbone to insert . The resulting plasmid was purified and transformed into competent DH5Œ± cells and incubated on LB AmpR agar plates at 37¬∞C overnight . Plasmids were isolated from individual colonies ( Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit , New England Biolabs , # T1010L ) and sequenced ( Mix2Seq Kit NightXpress , Eurofins genomics ) . The confirmed construct was transformed into competent Rosetta DE3 cells . Sample preparation and imaging of the FtnA protein standard Rosetta DE3 containing pRSETa mEos3 . 2 - A69T - FtnA were grown over night at 37¬∞C and 200 rpm in 50 mL AIM ( autoinducing medium containing freshly added 25 g / L glucose ( Carl Roth , # X997 . 2 ) and 100 g / L lactose ( Carl Roth , # 6868 . 1 ) ) . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 x g and 4¬∞C for 30 min and the pellet was resuspended in 2 mL 50 mM Tris HCl ( Carl Roth , # AE15 . 2 ) containing 25 mM NaCl ( Sigma - Aldrich , # S3014 - 500G ) at pH 8 . 5 . The bacterial cell wall was digested by incubation with 50 mg / mL Lysozyme ( Sigma - Aldrich , # L2879 ) for 2 h at 4¬∞C . The sample was homogenized ( Tough micro - organism lysing tubes ( Bertin , # VK05 ) with 0 . 5 mm glass beads in Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer at 3x 15 s and 5000 rpm at RT ) . The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4000 x g for 30 min at 4¬∞C and the supernatant was transferred into a clean Eppendorf tube . The centrifugation and transfer were repeated to ensure a debris - free supernatant . For long - term storage 30 % glycerol ( Sigma - Aldrich , # G5516 ) was added and the stock was kept at - 20¬∞C until further use . In order to prepare the FP - FtnA oligomer surfaces , the mEos3 . 2 - A69T - FtnA stock was diluted 1 : 5000 in 50 mM Tris HCl containing 25 mM NaCl at pH 8 . 5 and incubated with a sonicated 1 : 1000 dilution of dark red ( 660 / 680 ) FluoSpheres ( Molecular probes , # F8807 ) on a clean , poly - L - lysine coated Ibidi 8 - well glass bottom slide for 10 min . The sample was washed twice using 50 mM Tris HCl containing 25 mM NaCl at pH 8 . 5 and 0 . 5 % w / v low gelling agarose solution ( Sigma - Aldrich , # A9414 - 100G ) was carefully added to the top to ensure proper immobilization . After gelation for 5 min on ice 300 ¬µL of 50 mM Tris HCl containing 25 mM NaCl at pH 8 . 5 were added to the imaging well . The same microscope setup and imaging routine that was used for imaging the triple - color strain library was utilized to image the isolated mEos3 . 2 - A69T - FtnA oligomers . To simulate the mScarlet - I imaging & bleaching step prior to mEos3 . 2 - A69T imaging , the sample was first illuminated with the 561 nm laser at 1 kW * cm - 2 for 1 min before the PC - PALM read - out of mEos3 . 2 - A69T was recorded . Data analysis An overview of the workflow can be found in Supplementary Figure S5 . 10 Localization , drift correction and filtering First , all movies were localized using ThunderSTORM ( Ovesny et al . , 2014 ) with the B - spline wavelet filter with a scale of 2 . 0 pixel and order of 3 , a 8 pixel neighborhood and threshold of 1 . 5 * std ( wavelet ) , the integrated Gaussian PSF model with a sigma of 1 . 4 pixel and a weighted least squares optimization with a fit radius of 4 pixel . The fluorescent beads embedded in the sample were used for drift correction . The combined drift trace as well as the drift trace for each bead were saved and checked for inconsistencies . In those instances , the localization file was manually drift corrected using a custom script written in Python 3 that allowed the selection of individual beads . A nearest neighbor tracking algorithm based on kd - tree ( Jones et al . , 2001 ) was run on the localization files . For each localization , the nearest neighboring localization in a 150 nm radius was identified in the first subsequent frame . Neighbor identifiers were stored and used to connect localizations into tracks . Tracks were then merged by averaging the coordinates , intensity and PSF width of all localizations in a track . Averaged localizations were filtered based on these parameters to discard statistical outliers ( Q1 - 1 . 5 * IQR , Q3 + 1 . 5 * IQR ) in intensity and chi - square goodness of fit . For the PSF width , a set threshold of a sigma of 70 - 200 nm was used . Visualization and Manual Analytics For several manual steps , localizations were visualized in a custom software able to flexibly zoom in / out and to switch between / overlay sad1 / POI / cnp1 CENP - A channels . Using this tool , individual localizations could be selected and classified . For channel alignment , localizations belonging to the same fiducial marker in all three channels were grouped together . Cells with visible kinetochore protein clusters in the focal plane were selected and classified as individual region of interests ( ROIs ) and all clusters were annotated . cnp1 CENP - A clusters were paired together with corresponding POI clusters . Whenever there was any doubt whether two clusters belonged to the same kinetochore or whether a cluster represented a single centromere region or several , the clusters were discarded . Two exemplary data sets can be found in the zip - file Supplementary data 1 . The annotation work was quality - checked by cross - checking the annotation of two different persons . Channel alignment The alignment between two channels along a given axis was calculated as the inverse - variance weighted mean displacement of beads present in both channels . The position of a bead in each channel was calculated as the mean position of all localizations associated with the given bead in this channel . The variance of the displacement is then given by the sum of 11 the squared standard errors of the two positions . The alignment of two channels was deemed viable if it was based on at least two beads and a minimum of 15000 ( channels 1 & 2 ) or 180 ( channel 3 ) localizations . Initially , only beads with e - | log ( FWHMx / FWHMy ) | > 0 . 9 were used . For all movies , where this did not result in a viable alignment , this threshold was successively lowered to 0 . 8 , 0 . 7 , 0 . 6 , and 0 . 5 until a viable alignment was found . Movies for which no viable assignment could be found using this procedure were not taken into consideration when estimating the cnp1 CENP - A - POI distances . Distance calculation We used Bayesian inference to determine the real distance between cnp1 CENP - A and the POI from the measured centers of their respective clusters , assuming Gaussian measurement errors of uncertain size . To improve accuracy , we also took the position of the associated spindle pole into account , as the three points ( centers of POI , cnp1 CENP - A and corresponding sad1 cluster ) can be assumed to lie on a straight line . As it is not possible to reliably determine which spindle pole a centromere is attached to , we built a mixture model to take both possibilities into account . ( The SPB closest to a kinetochore is not necessarily the SPB to which the kinetochore is attached to . The reasons for this are that S . pombe undergoes closed mitosis where the nuclear envelope doesn‚Äôt break up before chromosomes separate and , furthermore , kinetochores oscillate back and forth along the mitotic spindle until DNA segregation takes place ( Rieder et al . , 1986 ) ) . To formalize the idea that a centromere is more likely to be attached to the closer spindle pole , we calculated a mixture coefficient Œª = 1 / ( 1 + ( d 2 / d 1 ) - 3 ) , where d 1 and d 2 are the measured distances between cnp1 CENP - A and the first and second spindle pole , respectively . The coefficient then corresponds to the prior probability that the centromere is attached to the first spindle pole . We visualize the model in Supplementary Figure S6 . We considered three types of Gaussian measurement errors : the measurement error of the spindle , the measurement error of the center of the POI and cnp1 CENP - A clusters , and the error of the alignment of the different channels . As the localizations belonging to a single spindle pole are ( approximately ) normally distributed , the variance of their mean can be estimated with high precision from the sample variance in x and y . The variances of the errors of the clusters and the alignment are more difficult to estimate directly and were therefore estimated together with the cnp1 CENP - A - POI distances , using a scaled inverse œá 2 distribution as prior . Whereas the measurement error can be different for each individual cluster , the alignment error was assumed to be identical for all clusters in a movie . For the alignment error , we estimated the scale parameter œÑ 2 of the prior distribution from the position of the beads in different channels ( although this is likely to be an underestimation , as the same beads were 12 used to calculate the alignment ) and the degrees of freedom ŒΩ from the number of beads used in the movie . We used constant values œÑ 2 = 100 nm 2 and ŒΩ = 4 for the error of the cluster centers , as they seemed to work reasonably well upon visual inspection . A more objective estimation of this error is difficult , as it results mainly from errors in the clustering , which was performed manually . We used the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm as implemented by Stan ( Carpenter et al . , 2017 ; Stan Development Team , 2021 ) and the CmdStanPy python package ( Stan Development Team , 2019 ) to approximate the posterior distribution of the cnp1 CENP - A - POI distances according to our model ( code in Supplementary File 1 and on GitHub : https : / / github . com / Endesfelder - Lab / Kinetochore _ Distances ) . Posterior means are plotted in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 1 , full posterior distributions are shown in Supplementary Figure S7 . Protein Stoichiometry SMLM localization counts do not directly reflect on the real POI copy numbers due to several over - and undercounting factors ( e . g . incomplete FP maturation or photoconversion or FP blinking ( Turkowyd et al . , 2016 ) ) . A robust way to acquire statistically correct average POI copy numbers is to calibrate the localization count data with corresponding data of a protein standard of known stoichiometry using the same sample , imaging and analysis protocols as for imaging the POI . We utilized the Escherichia coli protein ferritin ( FtnA ) , a homo - oligomeric protein standard of 24 subunits labeled by mEos3 . 2 - A69T to calibrate our POI localization counts ( Finan et al . , 2015 ; Virant et al . , 2018 ) . FtnA assembles from monomers into dimers to form 8mers which then arrange into the final 24mer structure . As depicted in Supplementary Figure S8a , FtnA assembly intermediates ( FtnA monomers , dimers , 8mers ) , full 24mers as well as aggregates can be identified by eye and their intrinsic stoichiometric differences are sufficient to discriminate them by fluorescence intensities . We manually selected 1458 8mers and 725 24mers from 29 imaging ROIs from two imaging days . Their localization count distribution yields a mean of 7 . 27 ¬± 2 . 72 STD and 21 . 68 ¬± 10 . 2 STD counts per 8mer and 24mer cluster , respectively ( Supplementary Figure S8 b and c ) . Thus , both give a correction factor of about 0 . 9 to translate localization counts into POI counts . With the help of this factor , all POI counts were translated into POI copy numbers per centromeric cluster as given in Table 2 . Verifying the reliability of measured localizations counts and distances In all measurements , we quantitatively assessed not only the localization counts for the POI clusters , but also the counts of the corresponding PAmCherry1 - cnp1 CENP - A cluster . We use 13 these reference counts to identify possible inconsistencies in the sample preparations and imaging routines of the different experiments . The PAmCherry1 localization counts for the cnp1 CENP - A reference remained constant independent of individual sample preparations , imaging days and different strains as can be seen in Supplementary Figure S9 b , where the data is exemplarily sorted into the different strain categories . The POI protein copy numbers as given in Table 2 show a large coefficient of variation . To assess to which extend this variability reflects a technical inability to measure protein levels accurately or some flexibility in kinetochore protein stoichiometry ( e . g . due to differing numbers of kMTs per kinetochore ) , we can use the data of the FtnA oligomer counting standard : The FtnA oligomer is a biologically highly defined structure . Thus , our FtnA measurements can directly serve as a proxy for the contribution of the technical inaccuracy of our PALM imaging and analysis strategy to the variance . Using the results of 21 . 68 counts ¬± 10 . 2 STD for the 24mers and of 7 . 27 counts ¬± 2 . 72 STD for the 8mers , we can estimate that the technical inaccuracy causes a coefficient of variance of 0 . 35 to 0 . 5 , thus almost completely explaining the experimentally seen coefficient of ~ 0 . 5 for our POI data ( Table 2 ) . Due this high technical inaccuracy , we cannot resolve sub - populations of possibly different kinetochore structures ( and thus POI copy numbers ) on 2 - 4 kMTs in our current counting data ( Supplementary Figure S9 ) . For distances , we examined whether the POI - cnp1 CENP - A distance depends on the mitotic spindle length , e . g . due to different phases in chromosome separation or different forces . As seen in Supplementary Figure S10 for the POI dam1 ( but being true for all our measurements ( data not shown ) ) , we do not detect any dependence of the centroid distance to the mitotic spindle length and therefore conclude that the kinetochores , as we analyze them , all show the same layers and stretching . This is further validated by the posterior distributions of POI - cnp1 CENP - A distances in Supplementary Figure S7 , which consistently show only a single , well defined peak . Furthermore , using a nup132 - GFP strain in early G2 phase , we measured the average nuclear diameter of S . pombe to be 2 . 4 ¬µm ¬± 0 . 19 ¬µm ( data not shown ) , in agreement with the literature ( Maclean , 1964 ; Toda et al . , 1981 ) . The spindles included in our analysis have spindle lengths well below the nuclear diameter , thus excluding anaphase B cells ( Supplementary Figure S10 ) . Results & discussion A strategy to unravel the kinetochore structure To investigate the kinetochore architecture during mitosis , we first designed a robust and quantitative multi - color SMLM imaging strategy which did not exist for S . pombe before 14 ( Vojnovic et al . , 2019 ) . Specifically , our aim was to measure protein stoichiometries as well as distances between different POIs in the kinetochore to build a molecular kinetochore map ( Figure 1a and b ) . We planned a triple - color strain library in which each strain contained the same two labeled reference proteins and a varying POI : A spindle reference to identify cells in metaphase / early anaphase and the orientation of the mitotic spindle and a second , centromeric reference to serve as the landmark for kinetochore assembly . To be a reliable reference , the chosen proteins needed a defined organization , sufficient abundance and to be present throughout the cell cycle . This led us to choose sad1 , a protein from the SPB ( characterized in ( Vojnovic , 2016 ) ) and the centromere - specific histone protein cnp1 CENP - A ( characterized in ( Lando et al . , 2012 ) ) . From our imaging priority ( 1 . registering the mitotic spindle plane , 2 . quantitative read - out of POI to obtain protein stoichiometry and POI cluster distribution , 3 . quantitative read - out of cnp1 CENP - A as reference for stoichiometry read - outs and for centromere - POI - distances ) , literature knowledge and experience ( e . g . on autofluorescence ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) and labeling strategies ( Supplementary Figure S11 ) ) , we derived several alternative measurement strategies ( Supplementary Text S1 ) . As summarized in Figure 1c , we finally decided on using dual - color Photoactivated Localization Microscopy ( PALM ) imaging by UV - and primed photoconversion ( Turkowyd et al . , 2017 ; Virant et al . , 2017 ) together with a diffraction - limited SPB reference as third color . For the FP labels , we chose the bright red FP mScarlet - I ( Bindels et al . , 2017 ) as the SPB reference and the UV - photoactivatable FP PAmCherry1 ( Subach et al . , 2009 ) as the centromeric reference . For the quantitative SMLM read - out of all POIs we chose the primed photoconvertible FP mEos3 . 2 - A69T ( Turkowyd et al . , 2017 ) , whose read - out we calibrated using a FtnA 24mer standard ( Supplementary Figure S8 , Materials & Methods ) . We first created a dual - color reference strain containing the fusions for both references . Using this strain as template , we then built a triple - color ( 3C ) strain library targeting in total 10 different key POIs of the inner and outer kinetochore ( Figure 1c , Materials & Methods and Supplementary Table S1 ) . Health assessment of triple - color strain library The integration of FPs targeting important proteins of the chromosome segregation process may alter cell physiology and can cause reduced protein functionality . We performed spot tests checking for temperature sensitivity ( 25 , 32 and 37¬∞C ) and for kinetochore - MT attachment defects using thiabendazole ( 2 . 5 , 5 . 0 , 7 . 5 and 10 . 0 mg / mL ) , a MT depolymerizing drug characteristic for inherent mitotic defects ( Tang et al . , 2013 ) ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Furthermore , we tested all cells for a wildtype - like phenotype via flow cytometry ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . In both tests , our strains showed no deviations from the parental h + / WT strain except for two strains , the cnp3 CENP - C - 3C strain and the dam1 - 3C strain . cnp3 CENP - 15 C - 3C exhibited both , a TBZ sensitivity in the spot tests as well as a notably larger cell size in the flow cytometry data . Due to this prominent phenotype , the cnp3 CENP - C - 3C strain was excluded from further analyses . Interestingly , cnp3 CENP - C is thought to interact with the N - terminal CATD region of cnp1 CENP - A via its C - terminus ( Black et al . , 2007 ; Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Guse et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , the genetic tagging of both interacting protein termini might have caused the observed defects due to the proximity of the N - terminal cnp1 CENP - A and C - terminal cnp3 CENP - C FP - tags . This hypothesis is supported by measurements using a single - color strain where only the cnp3 CENP - C C - terminus was tagged but both reference proteins remained native . This cnp3 CENP - C - 1C strain did not show any modified phenotype ( data not shown ) . The dam1 - 3C strain appeared to be more stable in TBZ spot tests . Interestingly , similar results were measured in two other S . pombe studies : a deletion mutant for dam1 was hypersensitive to TBZ , whereas a C - terminal truncation mutant ( dam1 - 127 ) had some higher TBZ resistance ( Sanchez ‚Äê Perez et al . , 2005 ) . Second , a mutant with two mutations in the C - terminal region of dam1 ( H126R and E149G ) also proved to be more resistant to TBZ than the wildtype ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) . These observations suggest that the C - terminus of dam1 is important for controlling microtubule stability and that the C - terminal FP - tag in the dam1 - 3C strain increases stability . As the dam1 - 3C strain showed no mitotic delay or altered phenotype it was included in the study . Determining kinetochore distances and protein stoichiometry All triple - color strain library imaging samples were prepared and imaged by a strict protocol that was repeated on different days using several biological replicates ( Materials & Methods ) . Since single centromeres can only be resolved during metaphase / early anaphase ( examples in Supplementary Figure S10 , ( Tournier et al . , 2004 ) ) , the fraction of cells in this phase was increased via cell cycle synchronization ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . All data was classified and postprocessed by several manual and automated SMLM data analysis steps as outlined in Supplementary Figure S5 and described in the Materials & Methods . The final , annotated data was stored in a SQL database structure . For this work , we then focused on the distances of the different POI clusters to the centromeric region marked by cnp1 CENP - A and their copy numbers per POI cluster . To determine the best estimates for the POI - cnp1 CENP - A distances , we used Bayesian inference and derived the posterior probability distribution for each POI - cnp1 CENP - A distance using Stan ( Materials & Methods ) . In our Bayesian model ( Supplementary Figure S6 , Materials & Methods ) , we explicitly accounted for the angular offset between the kMT axes and the spindle axis . We visualize this offset for all cnp1 CENP - A centroids in Supplementary Figure S12 . We further calibrated the measured localization counts per POI 16 cluster using reference data of bacterial ferritin FtnA , an established homo - oligomer protein standard with 24 subunits ( Supplementary Figure S8 , Materials & Methods ) . In Figure 2 , we summarize all measured mean kinetochore distances in reference to cnp1 CENP - A and protein stoichiometries . The exact values and statistics can also be found in Tables 1 and 2 . As discussed in more detail below for each POI , our in - situ measurements are consistent with previous work based on conventional fluorescence microscopy ( these literature studies , however , show considerable variation between them ) and very accurately confirm structural data from in vitro EM and crystallography studies . For our direct distance comparisons to structural data below , it should be considered that i ) typically tens to hundreds of amino acids long sequences of the termini are unstructured and are therefore missing from structural data , which ii ) also do not carry FP tags of 2 - 3 nm barrel size . In our results below , we will discuss the kinetochore structure from the inner kinetochore building on top of the centromeric region to the outer kinetochore proteins which facilitate microtubule attachment . fta2 CENP - P and fta7 CENP - Q are part of the COMA complex / CCAN network and are known to possess a strict 1 : 1 stoichiometry with their C - termini oriented in the same direction and close to each other . Our in situ determined distances of 11 . 4 ¬± 1 . 9 nm for fta2 CENP - P and 11 . 7 ¬± 2 . 9 nm for fta7 CENP - Q and the POI copy numbers of 55 . 1 ¬± 3 . 3 and 57 . 4 ¬± 4 . 1 and thus in a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 reflect these properties and are consistent with recent cryo - EM data from the reconstituted S . cerevisiae COMA complex ( Yan et al . , 2019 ) , where the distances from N - cnp1 CENP - A to fta2 CENP - P - C and to fta7 CENP - Q - C were determined to be 9 . 7 nm and 10 . 7 nm , respectively . Mis12 and nnf1 PMF1 are both part of the MIND complex ( MINDc ) in a 1 : 1 ratio ( Maskell et al . , 2010 ; Petrovic et al . , 2010 ) . Our distances are 28 . 0 ¬± 1 . 6 nm for mis12 - C and 27 . 1 ¬± 1 . 4 nm for nnf1 PMF1 - C , respectively . They confirm fluorescence data where all C - termini of the MINDc proteins line up at a similar distance ( Joglekar et al . , 2009 ) and show FRET proximity signal ( Aravamudhan et al . , 2014 ) as well as EM data showing all C - termini near each other ( Petrovic et al . , 2014 ) . For spc7 KNL1 , we calculate 25 . 9 ¬± 1 . 2 nm . Whereas full - length spc7 KNL1 has not been purified ( Maskell et al . , 2010 ) , its C - terminal structure has been resolved in EM data ( Petrovic et al . , 2014 ) and was determined to be close to the C - termini of mis12 and nnf1 ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) . In fluorescence microscopy studies , the spc7 KNL1 C - terminus was found to colocalize with the spc24 C - terminus of the Ndc80 complex ( which is reflected in our data for spc25 , see below ) ( Joglekar et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , the MINDc and spc7 KNL1 proteins‚Äô measured stoichiometry amounts to 1 : 1 . 3 : 1 . 3 ( protein copy numbers of 73 . 1 ¬± 3 . 1 mis12 : 92 . 6 ¬± 3 . 6 nnf1 PMF1 : 95 . 4 ¬± 3 . 3 spc7 KNL1 ) in our hands . This differs from the reported 1 : 1 ratio for mis12 : nnf1 PMF1 but posits a 1 : 1 ratio for nnf1 PMF1 and spc7 KNL1 . From biochemical reconstitution and cross - linking experiments , it is known that the MINDc has one binding site 17 for spc7 KNL1 at the C - terminus of mis14 NSL1 ( Petrovic et al . , 2010 ) . The sequence of that binding site ( i . e . the C - termini of spc7 KNL1 and mis14 NSL1 ) is conserved over species ( Petrovic et al . , 2014 ) . This places our in situ measured 1 : 1 ratio of nnf1 PMF1 and spc7 KNL1 in agreement with the in vitro measured literature and demands for future work on mis12 . Interestingly , whereas the kinetochore structures of the outer kinetochore are highly conserved ( D ' Archivio and Wickstead , 2017 ; Meraldi et al . , 2006 ; van Hooff et al . , 2017 ) , several strategies exist for bridging the centromere and outer kinetochore ( Hamilton and Davis , 2020 ; van Hooff et al . , 2017 ) . Accordingly , the use and importance of the different inner kinetochore structures , i . e . either based on cnp20 CENP - T , cnp3 CENP - C or fta7 CENP - Q ( COMAc ) , varies between organisms ( van Hooff et al . , 2017 ) : E . g . while the inner kinetochore architecture of Drosophila melanogaster is defined by cnp3 CENP - C ( Ye et al . , 2016 ) , S . cerevisiae primarily relies on the COMAc with cnp3 CENP - C serving as a backup strategy ( Hamilton et al . , 2020 ; Hornung et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , while cnp20 CENP - T is non - essential in S . cerevisiae ( Bock et al . , 2012 ; De Wulf et al . , 2003 ; Giaever et al . , 2002 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ) , it is the primary strategy in chicken DT40 cells ( Hara et al . , 2018 ) and human cells ( Suzuki et al . , 2014 ) which also rely on cnp3 CENP - C as a backup pathway ( Hamilton and Davis , 2020 ) . To date , the preferred inner kinetochore pathway of S . pombe is unknown ( Hamilton and Davis , 2020 ) . The deletion of cnp3 CENP - C in S . pombe is viable ( Chik et al . , 2019 ; Kim et al . , 2010 ; Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) whereas deletion of cnp20 CENP - T is not ( Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) . This is inverted for S . cerevisiae where mif2 ( cnp3 CENP - C ) is essential but cnn1 ( cnp20 CENP - T ) is not ( Bock et al . , 2012 ; De Wulf et al . , 2003 ; Giaever et al . , 2002 ; Kim et al . , 2010 ; Meeks - Wagner et al . , 1986 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ) . This is also reflected in the protein copy numbers as mif2 ( cnp3 CENP - C ) is more abundant than cnn1 ( cnp20 CENP - T ) in S . c erevisiae , chicken and humans ( Cieslinski et al . , 2021 ; Johnston et al . , 2010 ; Suzuki et al . , 2015 ) . For the COMAc , fta7 ( Ame1 ) and mis17 ( Okp1 ) are essential for both organisms ( Hayles et al . , 2013 ; Kim et al . , 2010 ) and deletions of fta2 and mal2 are non - viable in S . pombe . In our measurements , cnp20 CENP - T has a distance of 8 . 3 ¬± 2 . 4 nm to cnp1 CENP - A and thus at a similar distance as the MIND proteins fta7 CENP - Q and fta2 CENP - P . Furthermore , when comparing the abundances of the inner kinetochore proteins in between the different subcomplexes , we measured a 1 : 0 . 9 ratio of cnp20 CENP - T to the COMAc ( Supplementary Table S4 ) . This underlines its importance for S . pombe kinetochores as an essential protein ( Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) and suggests that S . pombe relies on the COMAc as well as the cnp20 CENP - T pathway in equal measures - unlike S . cerevisiae , which relies on the COMAc and cnp3 CENP - C . As representatives for the Ndc80 complex , we measured the proteins ndc80 HEC1 and spc25 and obtained distances of 36 . 2 ¬± 1 . 5 nm and 21 . 9 ¬± 2 . 2 nm and protein copy numbers of 107 . 2 ¬± 4 . 3 and 119 . 1 ¬± 6 . 2 , respectively . The shorter distance of spc25 - C to cnp1 CENP - A in 18 comparison to the distances of the MIND proteins to cnp1 CENP - A might reflect a spatial overlap of the POIs termini to interlock and stabilize the contact sites of the two sub - complexes and is in agreement with cross - linking data ( Kudalkar et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , the order of increasing C - terminal distances from spc25 to spc7 KNL1 , nnf1 PMF1 , mis12 and ndc80 HEC1 in our measurements correlates with decreasing FRET signal between spc25 and the POIs as measured by Aravamudhan et al . ( Aravamudhan et al . , 2014 ) . A previous study shows an increase of Ndc80c and MIND complex copy numbers from metaphase to anaphase in S . cerevisiae and S . pombe cells ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . For our data , we only selected and analyzed cells in metaphase and early anaphase . Comparing the mitotic spindle length given by the sad1 spots distance and corresponding localization counts of POI and cnp1 CENP - A clusters in our data , we did not detect any interdependence of mitotic spindle length and POI copy numbers , which confirms our cell cycle selection ( data not shown ) . For the dam1 / DASH complex , we calculated a distance of 64 . 2 ¬± 1 . 3 nm and a protein copy number of 63 . 7 ¬± 2 . 4 for dam1 . Comparing the distance of ndc80 HEC1 - C to dam1 - C , dam1 is closer than one would expect it when colocalizing with the N - term / globular head of ndc80 HEC1 ( Aravamudhan et al . , 2014 ; Roscioli et al . , 2020 ) . Dam1 possesses a highly variable length for different fungi ( Jenni and Harrison , 2018 ) . Whereas the dam1 C - terminus has been shown to interact with the globular head of ndc80 HEC1 in S . cerevisiae , it is predicted to be too short ( only 155 aa in S . pombe in comparison to 343 aa in S . cerevisiae ) to do so in S . pombe ( Jenni and Harrison , 2018 ) . Furthermore , deleting dam1 is viable for S . pombe ( Zahedi et al . , 2020 ) but inviable for S . cerevisiae ( Giaever et al . , 2002 ) . Consistent with these observations , we deduct from our data that S . pombe dam1 indeed interacts and colocalizes with the ndc80 HEC1 - loop region . To explore this further , imaging ndc80 HEC1 tagged at its N - terminus , within its loop region or imaging the DASH complex protein dad1 ( shown to localize in the DASH complex ring structure within the ndc80 HEC1 loop ( Jenni and Harrison , 2018 ) ) will be targeted in the future . In contrast to the proteins of the outer kinetochore Ndc80 and MIND complexes , which exhibit higher protein abundance , our dam1 stoichiometry data shows a similarly low protein copy number as the inner kinetochore proteins from the COMAc . This was already indicated as a trend in fluorescence measurements by Joglekar et al . ( Joglekar et al . , 2008 ) , where the authors measured increasing fluorescence and thus protein abundance from the inner to the outer kinetochore structure for both , S . pombe and S . cerevisiae , and a substantial drop for dam1 in S . pombe but not in S . cerevisiae cells . Summary 19 In this work , we used quantitative SMLM imaging to map the kinetochore architecture at a nanometer resolution . It is the first holistic SMLM study of a multi - protein complex in S . pombe . We established quantitative dual - color SMLM imaging in S . pombe which with we were able to drastically improve the positioning and stoichiometry accuracy of 10 kinetochore proteins being assembled in situ and thus within the full , native kinetochore structure . Next to drastically improving the accuracy of data of proteins that have been studied before , we add important data on proteins that a ) never been quantified or b ) not been quantified in S . pombe so far and provide nanometer - precise distances between the individual components as well as their copy numbers . This work helps to close the gap between the highly resolved in vitro studies and previous in vivo experiments . Our measurements on the structural organization of the S . pombe kinetochore proteins confirm the highly conserved structure of the outer kinetochore complexes between different organisms and add important details of the S . pombe specific outer kinetochore organization , e . g . on dam1 localization at the DASH ring . For the inner kinetochore , there exist several strategies to bridge the centromere and the outer kinetochore . Recently , increasingly more insights have been found on the differences between organisms in the use and importance of the three different inner kinetochore structures , i . e . based on either cnp20 CENP - T , cnp3 CENP - C or fta7 CENP - Q . While other studies have reported the generally different use and importance of the inner kinetochore structures between organisms , the S . pombe inner kinetochore architecture so far remained unexplored ( Dimitrova et al . , 2016 ; Hamilton and Davis , 2020 ; Petrovic et al . , 2016 ; Przewloka et al . , 2011 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) . In our work , we were able to quantify the stoichiometry between the inner kinetochore pathways for S . pombe , and provide new insights into the S . pombe specific strategy for the inner kinetochore with an equal importance of the COMA and cnp20 CENP - T pathways . The SMLM study of the S . cerevisiae kinetochore by Cieslinski et al . ( Cieslinski et al . , 2021 ) , which was carried out in parallel to our work , is a perfect complement to our work . Together , the data consistently shows that kinetochores possess similar architecture when comparing the phylogenetically quite distant yeasts S . pombe and S . cerevisiae . The basic organizational principle of kinetochore assembly is universal despite S . cerevisiae maintaining a point centromere and S . pombe a regional structure . A detailed comparison of protein distances and stoichiometries can be found in Supplementary Table S4 and S5 . Importantly , one substantial organism - specific difference for the inner kinetochore strategy surfaced : The ratio of cnp20 CENP - T to COMA is 1 : 0 . 9 in our case and 1 : 2 . 0 for S . cerevisiae . This is a strong indication that cnp20 CENP - T organization indeed differs between the two organisms . Furthermore , the S . cerevisiae work measured the position of ask1 , a protein of the DASH ring . Their positioning of S . cerevisiae ask1 is consistent with the distance we measured for 20 S . pombe dam1 and thus directly supports our reasoning that the C - terminus of S . pombe dam1 is localized to the DASH ring and not to the ndc80 globular heads ( like for S . cerevisiae ) . In the outlook , our strain library and results provide an excellent platform for future quantitative SMLM work on the kinetochore that goes beyond numbers and distances , and we will ‚Äì by further dissecting our S . pombe kinetochore architecture data ‚Äì next focus on structural shape details and changes during the cell cycle , as well as extend our work to medically relevant mutants .

Code availability The Stan code and our raw data to approximate the posterior distributions of kinetochore protein distances can be found in Supplementary File 1 . 21 Figure 1 : Imaging strategy for measuring the kinetochore nanostructure a During mitosis , the three sister chromatid pairs in S . pombe are attached to the two spindle pole bodies ( SPBs ) by tethering microtubules ( green ) , and the SPBs are pushed apart by a bundle of spindle microtubules ( red ) . The attachment between the centromeric region of each chromatid ( blue ) and the microtubules is facilitated by the kinetochore - protein complex ( orange ) , which consists of an inner and outer part . b Each protein of interest ( POI ) in the kinetochore complex can be mapped into the kinetochore nanostructure by localizing it in relation to two references , a centromere and an SPB reference . Information about its copy number n POI and its orientation and distance d POI to the reference proteins is obtained . c Imaging strategy : First , the SPB protein sad1 - mScarlet - I fusion is imaged by conventional epifluorescence microscopy to map the mitotic spindle . Then , both the POI and the centromere reference cnp1 CENP - A are measured by super - resolution microscopy : Here , each POI - mEos3 . 2 - A69T fusion ( here spc7 ) is imaged by primed photoconversion PALM ( PC - PALM ) , followed by a read - out of PAmCherry1 - cnp1 CENP - A fusion using UV - activation PALM ( UV - PALM ) . Scale bar 500 nm . 22 Figure 2 : POI - cnp1 CENP - A distances and protein stoichiometry within the kinetochore complex Left Schematic of the regional S . pombe centromere with parts of the inner and outer kinetochore . Whenever information was available , the shapes of POIs and subcomplexes are shown according to cryo - EM or x - ray crystallography data . Red stars mark the position of the C - terminal fluorescent protein marker mEos3 . 2 - A69T . Structures drawn at 25 % opacity were not investigated . Right POI distances to the reference cnp1 CENP - A and POI copy numbers per centromeric region as measured in this study . The colored boxes mark the mean and the whiskers the standard deviation of the posterior probability density distribution for each cnp1 CENP - A - POI distance ( Supplementary Figure S7 , statistics in Table 1 ) . The color of the box represents the mean POI copy number per cluster , as indicated by the scale bar ( distributions of localization counts in Supplementary Figure S9 , statistics in Table 2 ) . 23 POI mean distance [ nm ] STD [ nm ] N cnp20 CENP - T 8 . 3 2 . 4 49 fta2 CENP - P 11 . 4 1 . 9 82 fta7 CENP - Q 11 . 7 2 . 9 58 spc7 KNL1 25 . 9 1 . 2 215 nnf1 PMF1 27 . 1 1 . 4 161 mis12 28 . 0 1 . 6 102 spc25 21 . 9 2 . 2 51 ndc80 HEC1 36 . 2 1 . 5 135 dam1 64 . 2 1 . 3 155 Table 1 : Statistics of distance calculations For each POI , the posterior mean distance , posterior standard deviation ( STD ) and the number of kinetochores analyzed is listed .
