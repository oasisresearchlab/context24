Here we combined recent developments in cryo – electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) to produce three - dimensional snapshots of the HeLa cell nuclear periphery . Subtomogram averaging and classification of ribosomes revealed the native structure and organization of the cytoplasmic translation machinery . Analysis of a large dynamic structure — the nuclear pore complex — revealed variations detectable at the level of individual complexes . Cryo - ET was used to visualize previously elusive structures , such as nucleosome chains and the filaments of the nuclear lamina , in situ . Elucidation of the lamina structure provides insight into its contribution to metazoan nuclear stiffness . C ellular functions arise from an intricate network of macromolecular interactions . Hence it is of fundamental importance to decipherthis “ molecularsociology ” ofcells , ideally by direct visualization ( 1 ) . Cryo – electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) provides three - dimensional ( 3D ) images of cellular landscapes at increasingly higher resolutions ; with cellular fractionations , subnanometer resolutions have been attained ( 2 , 3 ) . Structural investigations in situ sensu stricto are more challenging owing to a number of limitations , which can now be overcome ; ( i ) cryo – focused ion beam ( FIB ) micromachininghasopenedwindowsintofrozen - hydrated cells and tissues , otherwise too thick to be examined directly by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( 4 – 7 ) . However , freestanding lamellas produced by cryo - FIB have little contact with the conductive support film , increasing the likelihood of beam - induced specimen charging in the TEM ( 8 , 9 ) . We resolved this by sputtering a fine metal coating onto the FIB - lamellas , as rou - tinely applied for biological cryo – scanning elec - tron microscopy ( SEM ) imaging ( 10 ) . ( ii ) Direct detectorsimprovethequalityofcryo - TEMimages substantially ( 11 ) , and ( iii ) the recently developed Voltaphaseplate ( VPP ) enhances ( phase ) contrast especially for lower spatial frequencies without theneedofdefocusing , rendering thetomograms directly interpretable ( 9 , 12 , 13 ) . Here , we com - bined these developments to produce in situ high - resolution 3D snapshots of the HeLa cell nuclear periphery . HeLa cells expressing b - tubulin : green fluores - centproteinandhistone2B : mCherrywerecultured on TEM grids , vitrified by plunge freezing , and subsequently observed by cryo – fluorescence mi - croscopy ( 14 ) . Interphase cells were thinned by FIB milling ( fig . S1 , A and B ) . A central slice through a cell is generated by removing the bio - logical material above and below an area of inter - est , resulting in a 200 - nm - thick lamella traversing the whole cell ( figs . S1 , C and D , and S2 ) . Data ac - quiredwiththeVPPonnonconductive ( uncoated ) lamellas resulted in distorted images ( fig . S3 ) .

Ourreconstructedvolumesacquired with the VPP exhibit high contrast , which allowed for direct visualization and identification of mo - lecular complexesinhabiting the nucleus and the nuclear envelope ( NE ) ( Fig . 1 and movie S1 ) . To provide a quantitative measure for the at - tained resolution , we subjected 80 S ribosomes to subvolume averaging . Cytoplasmic ribosomes from a single tomogram ( 900 particles ) yielded an average with a resolution of 28 Å ( Fig . 2A and fig . S4A ) . Subsequently , ribosomes were sorted according to their spatial association to either the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) or the NE outer membrane ( Fig . 2 , B and D ) . An average of the ER - bound fraction ( 143 particles ) yielded a reso - lution of 35 Å ( Fig . 2C and fig . S4A ) . ER - luminal densities of the translocon - associated protein ( TRAP ) complex and the oligosaccharyltransferase ( OST ) complex ( 15 ) were clearly rendered in ER - and NE - bound particles ( Fig . 2C and fig . S4 , B to D ) . Further classification revealed that OST is found on 33 % of ER - translocon complexes , in agreement with the stoichiometry of OST ob - served with isolated rough - ER vesicles ( 15 ) .

S5B ) , in which mRNA entry and exit sites of adjacent ribosomes allow threading of an interconnecting mRNA molecule on a smooth path ( fig . S5C ) . We then performed automatic tracing of polysomes to quantify ribo - some organization at the level of individual poly - somes ( Fig . 2D and table S1 ) ( 14 ) . A large fraction of membrane - bound ribosomes were associated into polysomes comprising up to 10 particlesand exhibiting a close - packed arrangement with a mean distanceof28nm . Thisanalysisprovideda detailed description of the native structure and or - ganization of the cytoplasmic translation machin - ery in human cells , recapitulating information obtained from microsomes ( 15 , 16 ) in a single in situ data set . Large complexes tend not to be strictly deter - ministic and are often subject to functional and structural variations , which are obscured by aver - aging . We therefore set to investigate whether the quality of our data would allow characteri - zation of individual complexes . A cross - sectional view of the NE ( Figs . 1C and 3 ) shows four nu - clear pore complexes ( NPCs ) , in which we visually identified the eight protomers at the level of the spoke ( Fig . 3C ) and the cytoplasmic rings ( Fig . 3D ) . An additional ring density surrounding the membrane is distinguished within the NE lu - men at the level of the spoke ring ( Fig . 3C , inset : arrowhead ) . Structures at these positions were previously described as discrete luminal densities ( 17 , 18 ) . Here , these densities formed a com - plete flexible ring with radial connections to the protomers . The superior contrast provided by the VPP is demonstrated in comparison to data acquired at 6 - m m defocus ( fig . S6 ) . Density profiles of the NPC obtained from data acquired with and without the VPP show similar variation in the intensities ( Fig . 4 , A to C ) . However , the contrast is im - proved by almost 60 % with the VPP despite a lower electron dose ( 60 e / Å 2 with VPP versus 100e / Å 2 withdefocus ) . Thisallowedustoexamine previously reported variations in NPC diameter ( 17 , 18 ) . We extracted subvolumes of eight com - plete NPCs from three interphase cells and per - formed alignment and averaging . The average reproduced the densities for the cytoplasmic and nuclearringspreviouslydescribedforthehumanNPCobtainedbothinsituandfrompurifiednu - clei ( Fig . 4D and fig . S7 ) ( 18 , 19 ) . Deviations from previous structures were evident for the pore di - ameter in the spoke ring ( fig . S7C ) . We determined the membrane circumference at the spoke ring level for each of the eight particles and our aver - age and found up to 13 % difference in the mean particle diameter between the individual pores ( Fig . 4E , fig . S8 , and table S2 ) . Within the same particle , we observed radial variations of up to 18 % . Complexes from the same cells were more homogeneous among themselves , a phenome - non recapitulated in the averages ( fig . S8 and table S2 ) , pointing to the intriguing possibility that variations in pore dimensions are related to specific physiological states . This confirmed previous observations of NPC plasticity and illustrates the problem of analyzing large flexible structures by averaging methods . At the same time , it emphasizes the importance of obtain - ing high - quality primary data allowing analy - sis of individual complexes . A network of intermediate filaments , forming thenuclear laminaunderlying theNE , isthought to provide mechanical support to the nucleus ( 20 ) . TEM images of the lamina are rare ( 21 , 22 ) , and 10 - nm - diameter filaments arranged on an orthogonal lattice have been described in prep - arations of Triton - extracted and metal - shadowed oocyte NEs ( 20 ) . Here , a volume of 30 nm in thickness underlying the NE is dominated by entangled , 4 - nm - diameter filaments ( Fig . 3B and fig . S9 , B and C ) . The filaments ’ diameter in the somatic HeLa cells is in agreement with molec - ular models proposed for the structure oflamins ; namely , dimers of coiled - coils assembled head - to - tail ( 23 ) . Segmentation of such thin structures is chal - lenging ; nevertheless , careful inspection of traced filamentsallowedustoobtainanestimateoftheirflexibility . We measured a persistence length of ~ 560 nm ( fig . S10 and table S3 ) , well within the range described for intermediate filaments and lamins obtained ex situ ( 22 – 25 ) . However , the small filament diameter determined herein re - sulted in a radically higher elastic modulus for the putative lamina fibrils than what could pre - viously be derived based on a diameter of 10 nm ( 14 ) . An elastic modulus of 190 MPa calculated for the individual filaments recapitulates meas - urements on whole nuclei , primarily attributed to lamin A ( 26 ) , suggesting that the fine isotropic matrix is the key player in conferring high stiff - ness to metazoan nuclei . Thecomplexmolecularorganization attheNE is demonstrated in Fig . 3 . Nuclear volumes ex - hibit regions of dense material , wherein chains of 10 - nm - diameter toroid densities are observed ( Fig . 3A and fig . S9A ) . The morphology of the abundant nuclear complexes is reminiscent of nucleosome core particles ( 27 ) arranged in a staggered conformation of nucleosome chains ( 28 ) . The clarity with which the individual com - plexes are discerned should allow unambiguous localization of single nucleosomes by template matching ( 29 ) anddeterminingtheirconnectivity . Variationsinchromatindensitycorrelatewiththe appearance of the lamina filaments , and they are both diminished in the vicinity of NPCs ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) .

The cytoplasm contains filaments of the cell ’ s cytoskeleton , dis - tinguishable according to size and morphology : actin fibers with a helical pitch , smooth inter - mediate filaments of variable diameters , and 13 - protofilament microtubules ( Fig . 3E and fig . S10 ) . Occasionally , actin filaments formed direct phys - ical connections to NPCs ( Fig . 3E ) . With the NPCs embedded within the stiff lamina on one side and directlyconnected tothecytoskeletonon the other , it becomes feasible to comprehend how NPC diameter may differ considerably upon the action of mechanical forces . Inconclusion , thevolumesreconstructed from these data reveal that many macromolecular complexes can be visually recognized without the need for computational averaging approaches and provide insight into structural variations at the level of individual complexes . Assisted by the synergistic application of recent technical devel - opments , cryo - ET holds promise for revealing the molecular organization giving rise to cellular function in unperturbed environments .

Saleska 1 * In evergreentropical forests , the extent , magnitude , andcontrols on photosyntheticseasonality are poorly resolved and inadequately represented in Earth system models . Combining camera observations with ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes at forests across rainfall gradients in Amazônia , we show that aggregate canopy phenology , not seasonality of climate drivers , is the primary cause of photosynthetic seasonality in these forests . Specifically , synchronization of new leaf growth with dry season litterfall shifts canopy composition toward younger , more light - use efficient leaves , explaining large seasonal increases ( ~ 27 % ) in ecosystem photosynthesis . Coordinated leaf development and demography thus reconcile seemingly disparate observations at different scales and indicate that accounting for leaf - level phenology is critical for accurately simulating ecosystem - scale responses to climate change . T he seasonalrhythm of ecosystemmetabolism — theaggregatedphotosynthesis , transpiration , orrespirationofallorganismsinalandscape — emerges from interactions among climate , ecology of individuals and communities , and biosphere - atmosphere exchange ( 1 ) . In temper - ate zones , seasonality of terrestrial production drives annual oscillations in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( 2 ) . In the tropics , plant transpiration seasonality mediates tropical convection and the timing of dry - to - wet season transitions — a poten - tially important climate feedback ( 3 ) . Seasonality in temperate zones is tightly linked toplantphenology ( 4 ) ( thetimingofperiodiclife - cycle events , including leaf development and senescence ) , whichinturnissynchronizedbycold - season dormancy ( 4 ) . However , the extent , mag - nitude , and controls on seasonality of ecosystem metabolism in year - round warm tropical ever - green forest systems are less clear ( 5 – 7 ) . For example , mostcurrentEarthsystemmodelsrepre - sent little or no phenology in evergreen tropical biomes , so any seasonality in photosynthetic flux that emerges is due to seasonality in climatic dri - vers ( 8 – 10 ) . However , remote - sensingobservations ( 5 – 7 , 11 – 13 ) suggest that central Amazon forests seasonally increase their photosynthetic capacity ( “ green - up ” ) duringdry seasons , whereas south - ern Amazon and African tropical forests show declines ( 13 ) . There is extensive debate over the mechanisms driving these patterns ( including whether they might be remote - sensing artifacts ) ( 5 – 7 ) and how they might be modeled ( 8 – 10 , 14 ) . To determine the extent of seasonality in tropical ecosystem photosynthesis ( or gross eco - system productivity , GEP ) , and to develop a more mechanistic understanding of how it emerges from climatic and biological processes , we address two key questions : ( i ) What is the rel - ative importance of climatic drivers versus plant phenology in controlling GEP seasonality ? ( ii ) What are the mechanisms by which these fac - tors exert control ? These questions conceptualize GEP as potentially driven by climate variability ( e . g . , temperature , light , or water ) interacting with fixed photosynthetic infrastructure ( e . g . , leaf surface area , leaf photosynthetic capacity ) , or alternatively , by variability in that photo - synthetic infrastructure , or some combination of the two . To evaluate the first question , we compared GEP seasonality ( derived from eddy covariance 972 26 FEBRUARY 2016 (cid:127) VOL 351 ISSUE 6276 sciencemag . org SCIENCE RESEARCH | REPORTS Corrected 11 March 2016 ; see full text .
