Type Journal Article Textversion publisher Kyoto University ARTICLE AIP1 and co ﬁ lin ensure a resistance to tissue tension and promote directional cell rearrangement Keisuke Ikawa 1 & Kaoru Sugimura 1 , 2 In order to understand how tissue mechanics shapes animal body , it is critical to clarify how cells respond to and resist tissue stress when undergoing morphogenetic processes , such as cell rearrangement . Here , we address the question in the Drosophila wing epithelium , where anisotropic tissue tension orients cell rearrangements . We found that anisotropic tissue tension localizes actin interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) , a cofactor of co ﬁ lin , on the remodeling junction via cooperative binding of co ﬁ lin to F - actin . AIP1 and co ﬁ lin promote actin turnover and locally regulate the Canoe - mediated linkage between actomyosin and the junction . This mechanism is essential for cells to resist the mechanical load imposed on the remodeling junction perpendicular to the direction of tissue stretching . Thus , the present study delineates how AIP1 and co ﬁ lin achieve an optimal balance between resistance to tissue tension and morphogenesis .

Such control relies on the ability of cells to sense the distribution of forces and tune morphogenetic signaling pathways in response to the mechanical inputs . Moreover , cells must resist or release tension / compression when deforming , proliferating , and moving during development 2 , 11 – 13 . While an understanding of molecular mechanisms for stress generation has evolved in the past decade , much less is known on how cells respond to and resist such stresses at the molecular level during morphogenesis . The actin cytoskeleton is capable of sensing and resisting applied forces both at the network and ﬁ lament levels 14 , 15 . For example , mechanical strain on the actin network alters the structure of ﬁ lamin A , which crosslinks the orthogonal ﬁ laments , thus inhibiting the binding between ﬁ lamin A and a downstream signaling molecule 16 . Single actin ﬁ laments decrease their helical pitch when mechanically relaxed , and such structural changes are ampli ﬁ ed through positive feedback between F - actin twisting and co ﬁ lin binding 15 , 17 – 19 . The actin network increases its elasticity or reorients the stress direction to resist applied forces by changing ﬁ lament dynamics and / or network architecture 14 , 20 , 21 . Whether and how these force - responsive properties of the actin cytoske - leton and actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) are involved in the development of multi - cellular tissue is largely unknown . During morphogenesis , cells change their relative positions along the tissue axis by remodeling cell contact surfaces . This process , called directional cell rearrangement , shapes a tissue and develops its multi - cellular pattern 22 – 25 . The Drosophila pupal wing epithelium provides an excellent model system to study the mechanism through which tissue tension controls directional cell rearrangement . Starting ~ 15 h after puparium formation ( h APF ) , forces generated in the hinge stretch the wing along the proximal - distal ( PD ) axis ( Supplementary Figure 1a - d ) 6 . The resulting anisotropic tissue tension acts as a mechanical cue to specify the axis of cell rearrangement 6 – 8 , 26 . Wing cells relocalize myosin - II ( myo - II ) at the adherens junction ( AJ ) that runs along the PD axis ( PD junction ) to resist tissue tension , and the balance between extrinsic stretching force and intrinsic cell junction tension favors PD cell rearrangement , thereby accelerating relaxation into a hexagonal cell pattern ( hereafter called hex - agonal cell packing ; Supplementary Figure 1c , d ) 7 . This relaxation may be primarily driven through interface mechanics , consistent with the observation of shear - induced reconnection of interfaces and hexagonal lattice formation in foam , non - biological soft matter 27 , 28 . However , in biological tissues such as the wing epi - thelium , interface mechanics must be orchestrated with molecular regulators of cytoskeleton and cell adhesion ( e . g . , force - responsive ABPs ) responsible for responding to and resisting tissue tension . Answering the question in the wing should provide a general mechanism of epithelial development , as all cell rearrangements are associated with sensation and resistance to forces from the surrounding cells . Here , we show that actin regulation mediated through actin interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) and co ﬁ lin is responsible for sup - porting tissue tension - driven cell rearrangement and hexagonal cell packing in the Drosophila pupal wing . AIP1 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans . In vitro studies have shown that AIP1 binds co ﬁ lin and F - actin and promotes F - actin severing via co ﬁ lin 29 – 32 . In vivo , AIP1 and co ﬁ lin control F - actin disassembly and remodeling during development 33 – 38 . We show that AIP1 is localized on the remodeling anterior – posterior ( AP ) junctions of wing cells , and tissue stretch is necessary for the biased dis - tribution of AIP1 . Inhibition of actin turnover by AIP1 or co ﬁ lin loss - of - function ( l - o - f ) results in the detachment of myo - II from the AP junctions , which hampers the stabilization of newly formed PD junctions . Interestingly , the disorder of junctional actomyosin is rescued by releasing tissue tension . Together , our data illustrate that actin turnover ensures a resistance to aniso - tropic tissue tension and promotes directional cell rearrangement by reinforcing the structural stability of remodeling junctions . This proposed mechanism is likely to be relevant to development of other epithelial tissues in which tissue tension coordinates with morphogenetic signaling pathways in individual cells . Results AIP1 is localized on remodeling AP junctions . To investigate the molecular mechanisms through which cells respond to and resist tissue tension during directional cell rearrangements in the Drosophila wing , we screened candidate ABPs ( Supplementary Methods ) . First , we examined the subcellular distribution of 19 ABPs at 24 h APF . ABPs demonstrating interesting localization patterns were assayed for l - o - f phenotypes . Since the polygonal distribution of cells is much easier to measure than the dynamics of cell rearrangement , we used the fraction of hexagonal cells at 32 h APF , when the hexagonal cell packing process involving directional cell rearrangement is nearly complete , as a proxy for cell rearrangement defects . As described below , screening iden - ti ﬁ ed AIP1 , which promotes F - actin severing via co ﬁ lin 29 – 32 , as a potential key regulator of cell rearrangement in the wing . During the screening process , we detected a strong signal for GFP - tagged endogenous AIP1 along a subset of AP junctions at 24 h APF ( Fig . 1a , b , Supplementary Figure 1e ; see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figure 2a , c for characterization of ﬂ are ( ﬂ r ) ( Drosophila aip1 gene ) protein trap line 36 , 39 ) . The directional bias in the AIP1 distribution became weaker at 28 h APF , when tissue tension is thought to contribute less to directional cell rearrangement ( Supplementary Figure 1f , g ) 7 . Time - lapse analysis con ﬁ rmed that AIP1 accumulated on AP junctions during junctional remodeling , and AIP1 gradually disappeared from newly formed PD junctions ( Fig . 1e , f ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . In contrast , AIP1 - GFP signal intensity remains low at stable AP junctions ( Fig . 1g , h ; Supplementary Movie 2 ) , indicating that AIP1 speci ﬁ cally localizes to remodeling AP junctions . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) of utrABD - GFP showed a smaller fraction of stable F - actin at the AP junctions than at the PD junction , which is in agreement with the AIP1 subcellular localization ( Fig . 1i – l ; Welch ’ s t - test , P < 0 . 01 ) . Next , we examined the localization of AIP1 and its cofactor co ﬁ lin along the apico - basal axis . We con ﬁ rmed that AIP1 is enriched at the AJ plane , whereas co ﬁ lin is diffusely distributed , as has been reported in the eye disc 36 ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Figure 3f - h ; see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figure 2b , c for characterization of twinstar ( tsr ) ( Drosophila co ﬁ lin gene ) protein trap line 40 ) . In the ﬂ r RNAi wing , hexagonal cell packing was disrupted , consistent with a defect in directional cell rearrangement ( Fig . 2a , b , d ; Welch ’ s t - test , P < 0 . 001 ) . These results prompted us to further investigate a role for AIP1 in tissue tension - driven cell rearrangement . Tissue tension - dependent localization of AIP1 . To characterize the mechanism by which tissue tension acts on AIP1 , we exam - ined whether tissue tension is required to bias the subcellular distribution of AIP1 . To this end , we relaxed the tissue stretch by detaching the wing from the hinge 6 , 7 . AIP1 was more evenly distributed along junctions in the mechanically relaxed wing ( Fig . 3a – d ) . WT wing cells accumulate F - actin along the PD rather than AP junctions , and such F - actin localization becomes non - polarized by relaxing the tissue stretch ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Therefore , our data argue against the possibility that the loss of accumulation of AIP1 along the AP junctions in Fig . 3c , d is simply a result of ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 05605 - 7 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 3295 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 05605 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications the change in F - actin localization . For comparison , the same experiment was performed with another ABP , Enabled ( Ena ) , which promotes the elongation of actin ﬁ laments 41 . As shown in Fig . 3g , h , Ena retained its localization at junctions and vertices in the absence of an extrinsic stretching force . Thus , tissue tension - dependent subcellular localization is speci ﬁ c to a subset of ABPs , including AIP1 and myo - II 7 , 42 . In addition to mechanical anisotropy , the wing develops a planar cell polarity ( PCP ) along the in - plane axis of the epithelium 43 , which may bias AIP1 localization .

AIP1 - co ﬁ lin are required for ef ﬁ cient cell rearrangement . Next , we examined whether and how the depletion of AIP1 affects directional cell rearrangement . We expressed dsRNA against ﬂ r using the Gal4 - UAS system combined with a temperature shift ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . Under experimental conditions , GFP - tagged endogenous AIP1 was not detected in ﬂ r RNAi cells ( Supplementary Figure 2d - f ) . We also con ﬁ rmed that ﬂ r RNAi did not alter tissue stress anisotropy per se ( Supplementary Fig - ure 4 ; Dunnett ’ s test , P > 0 . 9 ) 47 . The angles of new junctions generated by cell rearrangement were measured in time - lapse movies obtained at 24 – 27 h APF . When junctions underwent multiple rounds of remodeling , ﬁ nal and preceding rounds of junctional remodeling were considered separately for analysis ( θ ﬁ nal and θ all , and N seq and N all in Fig . 2e ; METHODS ) . This is because the former affects the steady alignment of hexagonal cells along the PD axis that accelerates the formation of a hexagonal pattern ( Supplementary Figure 1d ) , whereas the latter is an intermediate process of searching for an ef ﬁ cient relaxation pathway 7 , 24 . ﬂ r RNAi did not lower the frequency of cell rear - rangement ( Supplementary Figure 5 ; Dunnett ’ s test , P > 0 . 05 for N seq / N cell and P > 0 . 05 for N all / N cell ) . Both θ ﬁ nal and θ all became less biased toward the PD axis following ﬂ r RNAi , and the dif - ference between WT and ﬂ r RNAi was larger for θ ﬁ nal than for θ all ( Fig . 2f – h ; Dunnett ’ s test , P < 0 . 001 for R θ ﬁ nal and P < 0 . 01 for R θ all ; semicircle in Fig . 2f shows angle classi ﬁ cation ) . Contraction - elongation was affected by ﬂ r RNAi as expected from disoriented cell rearrangement ( Supplementary Figure 6a , b ) . As AIP1 is a cofactor of co ﬁ lin , we examined whether co ﬁ lin is involved in regulating AIP1 localization and PD cell rearrange - ment .

Collectively , AIP1 and co ﬁ lin are mutually dependent for their localization , and phenotype quality and strength were conserved between ﬂ y and yeast . Next , we addressed the requirement for co ﬁ lin in directional cell rearrangement . tsr RNAi , without changing the inferred tissue stress anisotropy ( Supplementary Figure 4 ; Dunnett ’ s test , P > 0 . 9 ) , caused defects in hexagonal cell packing ( Fig . 2c , d ; Welch ’ s t - test , P < 0 . 001 ) , directional cell rearrangement ( Fig . 2f – h ; Dunnett ’ s test , P < 0 . 001 for R θ ﬁ nal and P < 0 . 01 for R θ all ) , and contraction - elongation ( Supplementary Figure 6c ) , similar to that caused by ﬂ r RNAi . The acute delocalization of AIP1 impairs cell rearrangement . We also pharmacologically inhibited the functions of AIP1 / co ﬁ lin using the F - actin stabilization drug Jasplakinolide ( Jasp ) . Jasp stabilizes F - actin by competitively inhibiting co ﬁ lin binding to F - actin and decreasing the monomer off rate at ﬁ lament ends 48 , 49 . As expected from the uniform distribution of AIP1 in tsr RNAi cells ( Supplementary Figure 3c ) , the biased distribution of AIP1 was lost in wings incubated with Jasp for 4 h ( Fig . 4a – c ) . In contrast , the average signal intensity of AIP1 - GFP along junctions was not signi ﬁ cantly affected ( Fig . 4d ; Welch ’ s t - test , P > 0 . 2 ) . Under these conditions , the directionality of cell rearrangement was weakened ( Fig . 4e – g ; Welch ’ s t - test , P < 0 . 01 for R θ ﬁ nal and P < 0 . 05 for R θ all ) , and the overall extent of contraction - elongation was decreased ( Supplementary Figure 6d , e ) . In summary , the acute delocalization of AIP1 resulted in disoriented cell rearran - gement , highlighting the importance of the subcellular localiza - tion of AIP1 in regulating directional cell rearrangement and suggesting that ﬂ r l - o - f phenotypes are unlikely to re ﬂ ect early developmental defects . Thus far , we showed that tissue tension speci ﬁ es AIP1 localization in a cell , and AIP1 and its cofactor co ﬁ lin are required for ef ﬁ cient directional cell rearrangement . Thus , we next undertook experiments to answer three questions . First , how do AIP1 and co ﬁ lin promote directional cell rearrangement ? Second , whether and how do AIP1 and co ﬁ lin facilitate a resistance to tissue tension during directional cell rearrangement ? Third , how are AIP1 localization and function related to tissue tension ? Fmi and Dsh polarities are largely normal in ﬂ r RNAi cells . Previous studies reported that hexagonal cell packing is regulated through the PCP pathway via cadherin traf ﬁ cking in the Drosophila pupal wing , and AIP1 is required for PCP establishment 34 , 37 , 50 . Thus , AIP1 potentially controls cell Fig . 3 AIP1 localizes to AP junctions in a tissue stretch - dependent manner . a , b Low magni ﬁ cation images of DE - cad - GFP of the WT ( a ) and mechanically relaxed ( b ) wings at 24 h APF .

However , we observed the enrichment of Fmi and Disheveled ( Dsh ) 51 at AP ( vertical ) junctions in ﬂ r RNAi cells , similar to WT cells ( Sup - plementary Figure 7b , d , f , h ) . To quantitatively evaluate these observations , we measured the orientation of Fmi and Dsh polarities in each cell using PCP nematics ( Supplementary Fig - ure 7a ) 6 . According to this analysis , an off - axis fraction was detected for the Fmi polarity of ﬂ r RNAi cells ( Supplementary Figure 7c , e ; Watson ’ s test , P < 0 . 001 ) , and Dsh polarity dis - tribution was indistinguishable between WT and ﬂ r RNAi ( Supplementary Figure 7g , i ; Watson ’ s test , P > 0 . 4 ) . The dis - crepancy with previous studies may result from different l - o - f conditions employed ( see Supplementary Note 2 for details ) . To address how the Fmi polarity map affects cell rearrange - ment , we transiently overexpressed fmi - GFP , which has been shown to be a functional allele 52 , and measured the orientation of cell rearrangement in such tissues . fmi - GFP overexpression abolished Fmi polarity ( Supplementary Figure 8a , b ; Watson ’ s test , P < 0 . 001 ) , whereas the directionality of cell rearrangement was only mildly affected compared with that of ﬂ r RNAi cells ( Supplementary Figure 8c - e ; Welch ’ s t - test , P > 0 . 2 for R θ ﬁ nal and P < 0 . 01 for R θ all ) . From these results , we concluded that cell rearrangement defects observed in the ﬂ r RNAi wing is unlikely to re ﬂ ect PCP signaling dysfunction . The detachment of myosin cables along remodeling junctions . We next focused on myo - II , a well - established regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics during junctional remodeling 22 – 25 . Pre - viously , we showed that myo - II is localized on PD junctions in response to tissue stretching 7 . This global myo - II polarization pattern was not affected by ﬂ r RNAi ( Fig . 5 ) . However , a local structural change in junctional actomyosin was observed during cell rearrangement . myo - II formed a small ring - like structure , accompanied by D - α - catenin ( D - α - cat ) signal loss , in the short junctions of WT cells ( Fig . 6a ; hereafter called the myo - II ring ) , and much larger myo - II rings were detected in ﬂ r or tsr RNAi cells ( Fig . 6b , c , j ; Steel test , WT vs . ﬂ r RNAi , P < 0 . 001 , WT vs . tsr RNAi , P < 0 . 001 ) . The septate junction ( SJ ) protein Discs large ( Dlg ) was present along short junctions ( Fig . 6d – f ) , indicating that the myo - II ring structure did not represent cell extrusion ; instead , it is generated by the detachment of myosin cables around the cell vertex ( a similar subcellular structure was reported in ref . 53 ) , and the larger myo - II ring may represent its precocious formation . Time - lapse analysis showed that the myo - II ring was only transiently formed immediately prior to the reconnection of cell contact surfaces in WT cells . In contrast , the myo - II ring was present for a longer duration in ﬂ r RNAi cells and occasionally failed to convert into stable junctions , potentially resulting in disoriented cell rearrangement ( Fig . 6l – n ) . Mechanical rescue of myo - II ring enlargement . Interestingly , myo - II ring enlargement in ﬂ r RNAi cells was partially rescued by relaxing tissue stretch beginning at 15 h APF , when the extrinsic force begins to stretch the wing ( Fig . 7a , b ; Steel – Dwass test , WT vs . ﬂ r RNAi , P < 0 . 001 , WT vs . ﬂ r RNAi + hinge cut , P > 0 . 4 , ﬂ r RNAi vs . ﬂ r RNAi + hinge cut , P < 0 . 001 ) . This result suggests that AIP1 prevents the detachment of junctional actomyosin , which runs perpendicular to the direction in which the wing is stretched , by anisotropic tissue tension ( Fig . 7c ) . Actin turnover ensures mechanoresitance of junctions . To characterize the molecular mechanism by which AIP1 and co ﬁ lin regulate the reorganization of junctional actomyosin , we searched for molecules that connect actomyosin to the AJ in an AIP1 / co ﬁ lin - dependent manner . Canoe ( Cno ) ( Drosophila Afadin ) , which maintains the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the AJ in epithelial cells 12 , 53 , 54 , is one such candidate . We observed the speci ﬁ c loss of Cno in short junctions following ﬂ r or tsr RNAi ( Fig . 6g – i ) . Moreover , cno RNAi induced the detachment of junctional actomyosin in wing cells ( Fig . 6k ) . Together , these data indicate that disruption of the Cno - mediated linkage between actomyosin and the AJ leads to precocious for - mation of the myo - II ring . This observation is similar to that of a previous study in which the inhibition of actin turnover destabilized the attachment of the actomyosin network to AJs during apical cell constriction 55 , 56 . FRAP analysis consistently showed that AIP1 and co ﬁ lin were required for ef ﬁ cient actin turnover along AP junctions ( Fig . 8a – e ; Steel test , WT vs . ﬂ r RNAi , P < 0 . 01 , WT vs . tsr RNAi , P < 0 . 001 ) . In addition , ectopic F - actin accumulation , which may potentially re ﬂ ect sites of impaired actin turnover , was detected in RNAi cells ( Supplementary Figure 9 ) .

Furthermore , myo - II ring size returned to normal values following tissue stretch relaxation ( Fig . 8h , i ; Steel – Dwass test , DMSO vs . Jasp , P < 0 . 001 , DMSO vs . Jasp + hinge cut , P > 0 . 8 , Jasp vs . Jasp + hinge cut , P < 0 . 001 ) . Collectively , these data show that AIP1 and co ﬁ lin promote actin turnover to regulate the Cno - dependent reorganization of junctional actomyosin in a speci ﬁ c region and at the appropriate time during cell rearrange - ment . This mechanism is essential for cells to resist the mechanical load imposed on the remodeling AP junction in a process of complete directional cell rearrangement . Cooperative co ﬁ lin binding links tissue tension and AIP1 . Finally , we addressed how tissue tension is related to AIP1 localization and function ( Fig . 9 ) . Actin ﬁ laments alter their helical pitch in response to applied forces , and these structural changes are ampli ﬁ ed by positive feedback between co ﬁ lin binding and F - actin twisting ( Fig . 10a ) 15 , 17 – 19 . This suggests that in the pupal wing , F - actin along the PD axis , which is under tension , adopts a less twisted con ﬁ guration , leading to the pre - ferential binding of co ﬁ lin and AIP1 to more twisted F - actin along the AP axis via positive feedback between co ﬁ lin binding and F - actin twisting . To examine this hypothesis , we took advantage of an actin mutant that inhibits cooperative co ﬁ lin binding to F - actin ( yeast actin G146V ) 57 . Following misexpression of the corresponding mutant Drosophila actin5C ( act5C ) gene , AIP1 - GFP did not accumulate at AP junctions ( Fig . 9a , b ) . In contrast , the global polarity of myo - II distribution was not sig - ni ﬁ cantly affected , although myo - II - GFP signals became diffuse along the junction ( Fig . 9c , d ) . Moreover , the misexpression of mutant act5C caused the detachment of junctional actomyosin and the AJ ( Fig . 9e , f ; Wilcoxon rank sum test , P < 0 . 001 ) , resulting in impaired hexagonal cell packing ( Fig . 9g – i ; Welch ’ s t - test , P < 0 . 001 ) .

Thus , our data support the hypoth - esis that the cooperative binding of co ﬁ lin to twisted , mechani - cally relaxed F - actin links anisotropic tissue tension and AIP1 localization and function ( Fig . 10b ) . Discussion In addition to global patterning determined by signaling mole - cules , global mechanical patterning represents another strategy for facilitating the long - range coordination of tissue development . This concept raises the questions as to how tissue - scale forces regulate biochemical signaling within or between cells and how cells subjected to tissue - scale forces maintain structural integrity when undergoing morphogenetic processes . The results of the present study highlight that actin regulation mediated through AIP1 and co ﬁ lin achieves an optimal balance between resistance to anisotropic tissue tension and morphogenesis . The current working hypothesis ( Fig . 10b ) is that cells respond to anisotropy in tissue tension via the cooperative binding of co ﬁ lin to twisted F - actin , leading to AIP1 accumulation along remodeling AP junctions . AIP1 and co ﬁ lin facilitate a resistance to anisotropic tissue tension and maintain junction stability , thereby supporting PD cell rearrangement . Our observation that the misexpression of mutant act5C induced the delocalization of AIP1 and phenocopied ﬂ r RNAi is consistent with the current working hypothesis that postulates the positive feedback between co ﬁ lin binding and F - actin twisting . Future development of a biophysical method to visualize the helical pitch of actin ﬁ laments inside a cell will enable a more direct test . We speculate that the myo - II ring is required to reconnect cell contact surfaces at four - way junctions . AIP1 and co ﬁ lin likely protect this temporally loosened junctional structure from ani - sotropic tissue tension by promoting actin turnover and strengthening the linkage between actomyosin and AJ via Cno , the Drosophila Afadin protein . Detailed molecular mechanisms that link actin turnover , junctional actomyosin , and E - cad / α - cat / Afadin remain elusive . Rapid actin turnover can prevent the aggregation of a contractile actin network and thereby maintain its uniform network structure 56 , 58 , which may be required for stable binding of F - actin to E - cad / α - cat / Afadin . AIP1 - mediated actin turnover can also activate biochemical signaling that b A r ea o f m y o - II r i ng ( μ m 2 ) a 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 WT flr RNAi flr RNAi + hingecut n = 24 n = 28 n = 35 flr RNAi + cut 2 μ m myoII - GFP D α - cat - TagRFP Merge c Control Actin turnover suppressed E - cadherin α - catenin Canoe / Afadin Actomyosin cofilin AIP1 Discs large ( SJ ) Tissue tension Fig . 7 myo - II ring enlargement in ﬂ r RNAi cells is rescued by relaxing tissue stretch . a Images of myo - II - GFP ( gray in a left panel , green in a right panel ) and D α - cat - TagRFP ( gray in a middle panel , red in a right panel ) in a mechanically relaxed ﬂ r RNAi wing .

In addition , it may potentially speed up lateral mobility of E - cad clusters to promote junctional remodeling 36 , 59 . Notably , candidate mechanisms mentioned above are not mutually exclusive . In the future , it would be necessary to address how different mechan - isms act in concert to realize mechanoresistance of remodeling junctions . This study uncovered a link between the biased distribution of AIP1 along the planar axis of a tissue and its function , a concept that was not addressed in previous studies investigating the role of AIP1 in tissue development 33 , 34 , 36 – 38 . Our data clearly indicate that tissue stretching is necessary for the AP - biased localization of AIP1 ; however , this observation also implies the existence of other factors because AIP1 accumulates speci ﬁ cally at remodeling AP junctions . Given that F - actin dynamically changes its dis - tribution during development according to tissue tension pat - terns ( Fig . 3e , f and our unpublished data ) , a more integrated understanding of actin dynamics and various ABPs is required to fully elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying AIP1 localization . In conclusion , the present study suggests two overlapping general strategies for the mechanical control of tissue develop - ment . First , tissue tension acts as a mechanical cue to bias protein localization and morphogenetic cell processes , thereby strength - ening adjustability and ﬂ exibility to regulate development . The conversion of tissue tension into structural changes in the actin ﬁ lament / network via ABP interactions may be a conserved strategy for mechanotransduction 60 , 61 , although conclusive , direct evidence in vivo is required . Second , global mechanical patterning must be reconciled to maintain the structural integrity of the cell / tissue . Future studies should explore whether the molecular mechanisms identi ﬁ ed in the present study potentially function in other developmental contexts , such as cell prolifera - tion and apoptosis , and / or in other epithelial tissues .

To determine an insertion site for the P - element containing an arti ﬁ cial exon encoding GFP in the tsr - GFP line ( # ZCL0613 ) 40 , we followed pro - tocols by BDGP ( http : / / www . fruit ﬂ y . org / about / methods / inverse . pcr . html ) and by Hoskins and Evans – Holm ( http : / / ﬂ ypush . imgen . bcm . tmc . edu / pscreen / ﬁ les / GDP _ iPCRProtocol _ 051611 . pdf ) . Brie ﬂ y , genomic DNA of the tsr - GFP line was extracted and subjected to restriction digestion using Sau3AI or HhaI , and the resultant DNA fragment was self - ligated . Then , the 3 ʹ end of P - element and its ﬂ anking genomic DNA was ampli ﬁ ed by using EY3 . F and EY3 . R primers for sequencing . The insertion site was determined using BLAST from FlyBase ( http : / / ﬂ ybase . org / ) . Western blotting . Pupae of yw , ﬂ areGFP , or tsrGFP at 24 – 28h APF were lysed in Laemmili ’ s sample buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 001 % bromophenol blue , and 713 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) . The lysates were boiled for 20 min and these samples were loaded into a 10 % poly - acrylamide gel . After SDS - PAGE , samples were transferred to a PDMS membrane ( Bio - Rad ) , blocked with 3 % BSA - TBS ( 20mM Tris ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 150 mM NaCl ) and incubated with anti - GFP ( 1 / 1000 , SantaCruz sc - 9996 ) or anti - α - tubulin ( 1 / 2000 , MBL PM054 ) diluted in 3 % BSA - TBS overnight at 4 °C . The membrane was washed with TBS - 0 . 05 % tween20 and incubated with HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( ThermoFisher ) diluted in 3 % BSA - TBS for at least 1h at room temperature . Blots were developed using ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents ( GE healthcare ) and imaged using LAS - 4000 IR multi color ( FUJIFILM ) . An original scan of the western blot is shown in Supplementary Figure 11 . Drosophila genetics .

Anti - Cno ( 1 / 400 ) 63 , anti - Dlg ( 1 / 500 ) 64 , anti - Dsh ( 1 / 1000 ) 65 , and anti - Fmi ( 1 / 10 ) 45 antibodies were used . Pupae at appropriate ages were dissected , and wings were ﬁ xed at room temperature for 30min in PBS containing 4 % paraformaldehyde . After washing with PBS con - taining 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , these preparations were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies . To visualize F - actin in wing cells , dissected wings were incubated overnight at 4°C with Alexa Fluor 546 Phalloidin ( 1 / 1000 , invitrogen A22283 ) . The condition of dissecting and ﬁ xing pupae was same as above . Image collection . To prepare the Drosophila pupal wing samples for image col - lection , pupae at appropriate ages were ﬁ xed to double - sided tape and the pupal case above the left wing was removed . The pupae were then placed on a small drop of water or Immersol W 2010 ( Zeiss 444969 - 0000 - 000 ) in a glass bottom dish with the left side facing downward 6 , 7 , 46 , 66 . The ﬁ xed time - point images other than Fig . 3a , b and time - lapse images shown in Fig . 6l , m were acquired using an inverted confocal microscope ( A1R ; Nikon ) equipped with a ×60 / NA1 . 2 Plan Apochromat water - immersion objective at 25 °C . Other images were acquired using an inverted confocal spinning disk microscope ( Olympus IX83 combined with Yokogawa CSU - W1 ) equipped with an iXon3 888 EMCCD camera ( Andor ) , an Olympus ×60 / NA1 . 2 SplanApo water - immersion objective , and a temperature control chamber ( TOKAI HIT ) , using IQ 2 . 9 . 1 ( Andor ) 66 . After imaging , we con ﬁ rmed that the pupae survived to at least the pharate stage . Surgical manipulation to relax the tissue stretch . Wings were detached from the hinges using forceps 6 , 7 . Hinges were severed at 23 . 5 – 24h APF to analyze the effects of tissue tension on AIP1 localization ( Fig . 3 ) or at 15h APF for rescue experiments ( Figs . 7 , 8 ) . Jasplakinolide treatment . A small drop of Jasplakinolide ( Jasp ) ( Invitrogen J7473 ) solution , which was diluted to 100µM or 200 μ M in 10 % or 20 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ; Nacalai # 13408 - 64 ) , was placed on a glass bottom dish . After removing the pupal case above the left wing , the pupae were placed in Jasp solution with the left side facing downward . Ten percent or 20 % DMSO solution was used as the control . Filter papers soaked in DMSO or Jasp solution were placed along the pupae to prevent drying . For the acute treatment shown in Fig . 4 , the pupae were incubated with 200 μ M Jasp solution starting at 20h APF and observed at 24 h APF . For the experiments shown in Fig . 8 , the pupae were incubated with 100 μ M Jasp solution starting at 15 h APF , when the extrinsic stretching force starts to act on the wing , and observed at 24h APF . Note that previous study has required two to three orders of magnitude higher concentrations of drugs in experiments using the pupal wing , likely re ﬂ ecting the fact that the drug solution must pass through the cuticle ( Tadashi Uemura , personal communication ) 46 . Therefore , the con - centration of Jasp in wing cells was ~ 0 . 1 – 1µM , which is within the range of values reported in other cells / tissues 48 , 49 . FRAP . sqhp - utrABD - GFP pupae at appropriate ages were mounted on an inverted confocal microscope ( TCS SP8 ; Leica ) equipped with a Leica HCX PL Apo ×63 / NA1 . 2 water - immersion objective . To photobleach utrABD - GFP along the AP junction , the region of the interest ( ROI ; 0 . 54 μ m ×0 . 54 μ m ) was irradiated for 0 . 1s using a two - photon laser tuned to an 880 - nm wavelength ( Chameleon ; Coherent ) . Images were collected at 0 . 437 - sec intervals . Fluorescence intensities ( FIs ) of ROIs were measured using ImageJ . FIs were normalized as the average FI at three subsequent time points immediately prior to photobleaching and subtracted the residual value immediately after photobleaching . A FRAP recovery curve was constructed by ﬁ tting the normalized FI to FI ( t ) = A ( 1 - exp ( - τ − 1 t ) ) using MATLAB , from which the stable fraction of utrABD - GFP was calculated . Image analysis Subcellular distribution of proteins . To characterize directional bias in the sub - cellular distribution of AIP1 - GFP , myo - II - GFP , and the AJ marker D α - cat - TagRFP , ﬂ uorescent signals along the AJ plane were extracted from a snapshot of live cells ( 0 . 094 µm / pixel ) . Subsequently , the following procedure was applied . First , the background signal was subtracted using the “ subtract background ” command ( r = 100 ) in ImageJ . Second , to avoid counting the signals at the vertices for all associated junctions , we omitted the signals for 2 pixels at the ends of the junctions when calculating the mean signal intensity along each junction . Each junction was divided into twelve bins according to its angle relative to the PD axis , and the average signal intensity in each bin was plotted . In addition , we calculated the magnitude R s and the orientation Θ s of the polarity , de ﬁ ned as R s 〈 s 〉 e i 2 Θ = 〈 s e i 2 θ 〉 − 〈 s 〉〈 e i 2 θ 〉 from a data set { s ij , θ ij } , where s ij and θ ij ( 0 ≤ θ ij < π ) are the ﬂ uorescent signal intensity and the angle of the contact surface between the i th and j th cells , respectively 7 , 47 . Larger values of R s indicate the stronger bias toward a particular axis . When analyzing time - lapse images ( 0 . 215 µm / pixel ) , we set r = 20 to subtract the background command . We omitted 1 pixel at the ends for junctions 6 – 8 pixels in length and 2 pixels at the ends for junctions longer than 8 pixels . The signal intensity along each junction was normalized to its temporal average . In Fig . 3l , Fig . 9a , and Supplementary Figure 2e , f , the animal was carrying one copy of AIP1 - GFP , and the brightness - contrast was adjusted using different parameters compared to those used for other homozygous samples . PCP polarity . We followed a protocol described in a previous study 6 to measure the orientation of Fmi , Fmi - GFP , Dsh , and DE - cad polarities . Brie ﬂ y , each pixel in an ROI was grouped into bins according to its angle relative to a cell center ( N bin = 36 ; the size of bin is π / N bin ) , and the average signal intensity in each bin { s i , θ i } ( j = 1 , 2 , . . . , N bin ) was measured . Subsequently , the mean polarity angle Θ s was calculated as cos 2 Θ s ¼ Q 1 = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Q 21 þ Q 22 p , where Q 1 ¼ P N bin i ¼ 1 s i cos2 θ i and Q 2 ¼ P N bin i ¼ 1 s i sin2 θ i , respectively . Hexagonal cell packing . DE - cad - GFP images were skeletonized using ImageJ . From the skeletonized images , the position and connectivity of vertices were extracted , and the polygonal distribution of cells was measured in OpenCV . If the distance between the centers of the end pixels of an edge was smaller than 3 pixels in length , the edge was regarded as a four - way vertex 7 . Quanti ﬁ cation of cell rearrangement process . Cell rearrangement was manually detected from time - lapse movies captured at 1 - min intervals starting from 24 h APF at 25°C ( WT , ﬂ r RNAi , DMSO , Japs ) or at 20 h 30min at 29°C ( tsr RNAi ) . Subsequently , remodeling at each junction was automatically detected and manually assessed when necessary . By repeating this automatic detection and manual correction process , we estimated that > 90 % of cell rearrangement in a ﬁ lmed region were counted in this analysis . θ ﬁ nal and θ all represent the sets of angles from the ﬁ nal round and all rounds of cell rearrangement , respectively . The magnitudes R θ ﬁ nal and R θ all ( one minus circular variance ) and the mean orientation of θ are given as R θ e i 2 Θ = 〈 e i 2 θ 〉 ( 0 ≤ θ j < π ) . Larger values of R θ indicate the stronger directional bias . N seq and N all indicate the numbers of remodeled junctions and cell rearrangements in each movie , respectively . The frequency of cell rear - rangement was calculated by dividing N seq and N all by N cell , which is de ﬁ ned as the average value of the number of cells at the ﬁ rst and last time points of a movie . Stress inference . Bayesian force / stress inference solves an inverse problem between forces ( i . e . , cell junction tension and cell pressure ) and epithelial cell shape ( i . e . , position and connectivity of vertices that appear in an image ) 47 and provides relative values for cell junction tensions and cell pressures , allowing the global stress tensor to be calculated by integrating tensions and pressures 47 , 67 . The accuracy and robustness of force / stress inference have been rigorously tested both in silico and in vivo 47 , 68 , 69 . In this study , we quanti ﬁ ed the normal stress difference σ A ≡ ( σ xx – σ yy ) / 2 as a measure for the anisotropy of tissue stress from images of DE - cad - GFP . Statistics . Data are presented as the mean± s . e . m . in plots of the signal intensity of AIP1 - GFP , myo - II - GFP , and D α - cat - TagRFP in each angular bin and as the mean ± s . d . in the other plots .
