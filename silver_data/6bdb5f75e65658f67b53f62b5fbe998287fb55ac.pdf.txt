Covid - 19 : breaking the chain of household transmission We urgently need new measures to protect household contacts Shamil Haroon , 1 Joht Singh Chandan , 1 , 2 John Middleton , 3 Kar Keung Cheng 1 The UK is one of the countries most severely affected by covid - 19 . Recent outbreaks in English towns such as Oldham , probably involving transmission within large multigenerational households , show the importance of getting the right public health measures in place now to prevent more widespread surges in infections . 1 Current test and trace policies have mainly focused on preventing spread in care homes , hospitals , and in the community . 2 However , contact within households is thought to be responsible for roughly 70 % of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission when widespread communitycontrolmeasuresareinplace . 3 InWuhan , the reproduction number ( R ) dropped from 3 . 54 to 1 . 18 after lockdown and cordon sanitaire . But the epidemic was only brought under complete control when Fangcang ( field ) hospitals were introduced to isolate cases outside the home , with R dropping to 0 . 51 after two weeks . 4 Current UK guidance advises household contacts to isolate within the same home as the index case for 14 days . 5 They make up the majority of contacts for infectedindividualsandarelikelytoremainexposedtotheinfectedhouseholdmemberduringthisperiodofisolation . 6 Despite guidance advising household members to socially distance , contacts are likely to interact repeatedly—during mealtimes , for example—and to share facilities such as bathrooms . We know that transmission is more likely to occur indoors than outdoors . 7 The cumulative risk to household contacts from an infected person is likely to be substantial during peak viral shedding . In one study in New York State , 38 % of household contacts testedpositiveforSARS - Cov - 2 , andsimilarsecondary infection rates have been reported in China . 8 9 Transmission may be even higher among household contacts of essential workers , who are at greater risk of being infected than the general population . 10 Household members who are older , have underlying medical conditions , or share a bed or vehicle with theindexcasearethemostsusceptible . 91112 Children seemtobeatlowerriskofbeinginfected . 13 However , their stool samples and nasopharyngeal swabs can remain positive for SARS - CoV - 2 for more than two weeksaftersymptomresolution , 14 althoughtheirrole in transmission remains to be established . Governments should consider new public health measures to prevent household transmission as we prepare for a potential second wave . Household quarantineislikelytoremainanimportantpandemiccontrolmeasure , andgovernmentsupportforpeople quarantined at home is conspicuously absent in the UK : thispositionhasbeenchallengedbyindependent experts . 15 Effective isolation Effective isolation of index cases from household members could reduce secondary infections . 12 Wearing masks within quarantined households may help , particularly if used by the index case as soon as infection is suspected . 16 The World Health Organization recommends that infected people and unavoidable close contacts , particularly those in vulnerable groups , should wear medical masks , but PublicHealthEnglanddoesnotcurrentlyrecommendthis . Other measures that should be considered ( and evaluated ) includeclearadviceonenhancedpersonal hygiene ; cleaninganddisinfectingsharedtoiletsand other common spaces , door handles , and touch points ; and staggering mealtimes . People who are unable to self - isolate safely at home couldbeaccommodatedinspecialisolationfacilitiessuchashotelsandhostels , an approach adopted by some other countries , including Italy , Finland , and Lithuania . 17 In China , field hospitals were created to manage and strictly isolate patients with mild - to - moderate covid - 19 . 18 Nightingale hospitals in the UK could be similarly repurposed to support isolation of infected people with mild - to - moderate disease . As medical and nursing care needs are mostly modest , the cost would be relatively low . However , such a system depends on access to rapid testing for anyone with symptoms or possible exposure so that infection can be confirmed and isolationstartedbeforetransmissionoccurs . Itwould also require public trust that isolation in these facilities would be voluntary , safe , and supportive . Important questions about household transmission remain . Research should be done to identify the determinants of household transmission and the optimal strategies for isolating cases and protecting household contacts . These strategies will be particularly important for those at higher risk of adverse outcomes , including ethnic minority communities , peopleinlowincomehouseholds , and those living in urban areas with overcrowded housing . Until an effective vaccine is widely available , strategies to prevent household transmission and to support those in quarantine will be vital and should be a core part of any government’s strategy . It is high time that the UK government amend its mantra of “test and trace” to “test , trace , isolate , and support . ” Competing interests : We have read and understood BMJ policy on declaration of interests and have no interests to declare .
