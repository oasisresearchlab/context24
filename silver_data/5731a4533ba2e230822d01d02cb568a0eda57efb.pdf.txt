Transmission Model We would like to congratulate Quick , Dey , and Lin on develop - ing the flexible statistical modeling framework MERMAID for assessing transmissibility of COVID - 19 and associated drivers with incomplete surveillance data ( Quick , Dey , and Lin 2021 ) . The impacts of the COVID - 19 pandemic have been dramatic both in their depth , breadth and duration . Under - ascertainment and delayed reporting of cases are common and their pat - terns vary in surveillance data generated from many counties , states , and countries . There is an urgent need for analytical approaches to align data from multiple sources to provide real - time monitoring of the effective reproductive number and num - ber of prevalent infections which informs the public and policy - makers about local risk level . Combining data across regions , retrospective estimates of the impact of non - pharmaceutical interventions can guide future strategic decisions . In the transmission model in MERMAID , the infection potential in population i is driven by the number of prevalent infections in a population and their infectiousness , where infectiousness changes as a function of time since initial infection ( Quick , Dey , and Lin 2021 ) . This is similar to the framework proposed by Cori et al . ( Cori et al . 2013 ) . The difference in the MERMAID model is that the number of new infections at a particular time t is Poisson - distributed with mean equal to the infection potential times the effective reproductive number R it . The vector R i = ( R i 1 R i 2 , . . . ) is modeled using a log - linear regression model that can include a B - spline basis functions to model smooth trends in time . In this regression , time - varying or region - specific covariates denoting non - pharmaceutical interventions can be added . With additional constraints , such as assuming that regions share background time trends of effective reproductive numbers , the model can estimate the impact of these covariates . We draw the authors’ attention to other efforts to statistically model smooth trends over time in infectious disease outbreaks . Chain - binomial models were originally developed for micro - level inference , such as the analysis of household outbreaks , but have also been scaled up for use on aggregate , surveillance data ( Becker 1981 ) . The transmission model in MERMAID starts with the definition of w ∗ t , the conditional probability that an individual infected t days ago infects a susceptible individual , CONTACT Natalie Dean nataliedean @ emory . edu Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics , Emory University , Atlanta , GA 30322 . given that the latter is exposed to the former at current time . Let n ∗ t be the number of susceptible individuals exposed to an infectious individual i on day t , and the infectious person was infected on day τ . The number of new infections generated by individual i on day t then follows Binomial ( n ∗ t , w ∗ t − τ ) in the chain - binomial model . w ∗ t − τ is actually the product of the probability that person i remains infectious t − τ days after infection and the daily transmission probability between an infectious person and an exposed susceptible individual . The two quantities always appear as a product and are therefore not separately identifiable . It has been previously established that the chain - binomial model can be approximated by a Poisson incidence model when n ∗ t → ∞ , w ∗ t − τ → 0 and n ∗ t w ∗ t − τ → c for some constant c . This result has been applied to use the chain - binomial model to estimate the basic reproductive number R 0 in the exponential growth phase of pandemic influenza ( Yang et al . 2009 ) and the effective reproductive number R t of Zika ( Rojas et al . 2016 ) . In the application to Zika , the conditional probability of transmission was modeled allowing further adjustment for covariates , including age and sex ( Rojas et al . 2016 ) . An additional advantage of chain - binomial models is that they accommodate certain features of infectious disease dynam - ics . The serial interval is the time from illness onset in the primary case to illness onset in a secondary case , while the generation interval is the time between successive infections . These impact the speed at which an outbreak grows . The gener - ation interval is often approximated by the serial interval , due to the fact we observe time of disease onset rather than time of infection . In MERMAID , the distribution of the generation interval is derived as w t = w ∗ t / (cid:2) m (cid:3) s = 0 w ∗ s , where m (cid:3) is the maximum duration of the infectious period . This formulation implicitly assumes all the contacts between people are transient , that is , the probability a pair of individuals make contact with each other for more than one day is ignorable . This assumption works well when individuals randomly mix in a large popula - tion . This is not true in all settings . In close contact settings such as households , contacts likely last throughout the entire infectious period . In this case , a better formulation for the generation interval distribution would be w t = [ w ∗ t (cid:3) t − 1 τ = 1 ( 1 − w ∗ τ ) ] (cid:4) (cid:2) m (cid:3) s = 0 [ w ∗ s (cid:3) s − 1 τ = 1 ( 1 − w ∗ τ ) ] . The difference between these two formulations , however , makes little difference when w ∗ t ©2021AmericanStatisticalAssociation 1588 N . DEAN AND Y . YANG is small . A further improvement of the model may consider changes in the generation interval distribution over the pan - demic ( Lu et al . 2020 ) . 2 . Lag Model Stochastic lags complicate the interpretation of COVID - 19 surveillance data . Notably , there is a variable incubation period from the time of infection to symptom onset , with some individuals never experiencing symptoms ( asymptomatic infection ) . There is a variable latent period from the time of infection to infectiousness , with SARS - CoV - 2 characterized by high infectiousness immediately preceding symptom onset ( presymptomatic transmission ) . There is a lag until laboratory testing when testing is sought at all . Finally , there is a lag between testing and reporting to the surveillance system . In MERMAID , the lags from infection to confirmation ( reporting ) are handled as latent variables following a multinomial distribution which is integrated out via an expectation - maximization ( EM ) algorithm with Laplace approximation for computationally efficient estimation . Modeling the lag from infection to confirmation through a multinomial distribution is a general unrestrictive approach , with no parametric restriction on the individual probabilities other than summing to one . The authors show that estimation of key epidemiological quantities is insensitive to misspecifi - cation of the lag distribution , but incorporation of informa - tive prior knowledge may improve efficiency , particularly when surveillance data are limited . There is abundant literature on the incubation period which is an important component of the lag . Backlogs in reported cases can be highly variable , and lags can be long during an epidemic surge . The incubation period , on the other hand , is a relatively stable biological quantity , although it could vary across viral strains . Where available , using the date of symptom onset is preferred over the date of reporting , with many surveillance systems including this information . 3 . Ascertainment Model It is well - understood that many SARS - CoV - 2 infections are not captured in the surveillance system , especially those generating no or mild symptoms . Estimation of R t within a region can still be reliable when the level of underascertainment is stable over time , but ascertainment can vary along with testing capacity and the demands of a large outbreak . Furthermore , different regions are likely to have different levels of underascertainment . Recon - structing the complete magnitude of the epidemic is important for making comparisons across regions . In MERMAID , the vector π i = ( π i 1 π i 2 , . . . ) is modeled by logistic regression , where π it is the ascertainment probability for region i at time t . The authors suggest covariates such as number of tests , as a measure of testing capacity . The flexibility of a regression framework that can accommodate a wide range of covariates is a major strength , but then it is necessary to identify and collect the most valuable explanatory variables . This may require exploration of different covariates to determine what improves performance . In general , the level of underascertain - ment varies widely by symptom status , with severe disease most likely to be captured and asymptomatic infection most likely to be missed . This is a major reason why many COVID - 19 models are calibrated to deaths rather than reported cases , assuming that death reporting is near complete . A recommended exten - sion for the model is to incorporate surveillance data on hospi - talizations and / or deaths . A separate underascertainment model can then be included for different levels of disease severity . This type of stratified approach has been described for a spatiotem - poral modeling framework applied to the surveillance of hand , foot , and mouth disease in China ( Tang et al . 2019 ) . Another key population subject to underascertainment is asymptomatic infections . Epidemiological studies have shown asymptomatic cases are generally less infectious than symp - tomatic cases ( Li et al . 2021 ; Sayampanathan et al . 2021 ) , yet their role in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 may not be trivial given the enormous amount and relatively high mobility . In a Poisson transmission model for the hand , foot and mouth epidemics in children , the implication of not explicitly mod - eling asymptomatic infections on the estimation of transmis - sion rate was discussed ( Wang et al . 2011 ) . In addition , chain - binomial models have considered asymptomatic infections in household transmission via EM algorithms for influenza ( Yang et al . 2012 ) and SARS - CoV - 2 ( Li et al . 2021 ) . None of these methods accounted for under - reporting and delayed reporting of symptomatic cases explicitly and statistically , whereas MER - MAID moved this important step forward . Serosurvey data may help identify the number of unobserved asymptomatic infections , but additional data are needed to simultaneously estimate asymptomatic infections and underascertained symp - tomatic cases , for example , prior information on the probability of symptom development given infection ( Sah et al . 2021 ) . 4 . Serosurvey Model To make the intercept of the region - specific underascertainment model identifiable , data from routine serosurveys are used to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection . This is the last component of the likelihood . In the model , the underlying seroprevalence is defined as p ij = 1 n i (cid:2) τ ij t = 0 Y it , where τ ij is the j th survey and n i is the population size in region i . Depending on the serological test , there is usually a delay from infection to detectable antibody response , several days for IgM and two to three weeks for IgG responses . Most serosurveys measure the long - lasting IgG response . Incorporating a delay to reflect the time between infection and detectable IgG antibody levels will better capture cumulative incidence , particularly during periods of rapid epidemic growth . Therefore , we suggest redefining the seroprevalence as p ij = 1 n i (cid:2) τ ij − d t = 0 Y it , where d is the average delay . Another challenge with using serosurvey data is the poten - tial for antibody waning . Seroreversion can occur after sev - eral months , which can lead to an apparent decline in sero - prevalance and underestimation of cumulative incidence . This phenomenon has been observed in US states hit earliest in the pandemic , including New York and Connecticut . Explicitly modeling the process of antibody waning and seroreversion can correct this underestimation ( Shioda et al . 2021 ) . JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION 1589 Finally , in the pandemic phase with wide vaccine uptake , the seroprevalence model may need to incorporate data on vaccination as this also increases population antibody levels to the spike protein . One approach rolled out in serosurveys is to measure antibody levels to a different target antigen not included in the vaccine . Infection with SARS - CoV - 2 elicits anti - bodies to the nucleocapsid protein , but vaccination with mRNA or adenovirus vaccines does not . If the measured antibodies are targeting antigens not included in the vaccines , then no adjustment is necessary ; otherwise , vaccination data are needed to adjust the number of positive samples . 5 . Conclusions The MERMAID model provides a comprehensive statistical framework for integrating COVID - 19 surveillance data across locations , and we commend the authors for their achievement . The model expands upon prior work for real - time estimation of the effective reproductive number ( Cori et al . 2013 ) to accommodate several unique data challenges . To model new infections , the authors construct a smoothed regression for the effective reproductive number using time - varying and region - specific covariates . Stochastic lags in the time until a case is reported are handled using latent variables with an EM algo - rithm . A smoothed regression model for underascertainment over time leverages covariates on testing capacity and test positivity . Finally , serosurvey data are directly incorporated into the likelihood to make the underascertainment model identifiable . This statistical framework provides a structure for analyzing epidemic data , yet a major persistent challenge is the availabil - ity of high - quality data and our confidence in drawing robust conclusions . The data example provided by the authors looks at the U . S . states . Lack of standardization across state surveillance systems has been a major barrier throughout the pandemic ( Dean 2021 ) and greatly limits what covariates can be included in the model . Furthermore , these analyses would ideally be conducted using a smaller spatial unit than state , as outbreak dynamics are inherently local and highly heterogeneous . Spatial correlation between units then becomes more important and is a recommended extension to smooth trends . For drawing robust conclusions , clear articulation of the public health goal and intended use of the model is key for determining the appropriate level of complexity . Characterizing underascertainment is important for reconstructing cumulative incidence . But unless there are big swings in underascertain - ment over time , it is less critical for estimating R t and cap - turing real - time changes in the epidemic . A strength of the MERMAID model is the ability to combine data across loca - tions to retrospectively investigate the impact of certain policy decisions . Yet , as noted by the authors , policy changes are often made concurrently , making identifiability challenging . Dates on which policies are enacted are also imperfect measures of human behavior , compared to widely available human mobility data themselves . Conclusions should be drawn carefully and very cautiously given the complexity of the problem and the uncertainty in the quality of available data . We encourage public health agencies and researchers to use MERMAID and similar analytic tools , and for biostatisticians to continue to work in this area to develop flexible , computation - ally efficient , and user - friendly methods to improve the quality of infectious disease surveillance .
