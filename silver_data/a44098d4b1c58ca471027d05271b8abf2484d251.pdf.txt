Evans and Harvey T . McMahon MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge , UK CB2 2QH Supporting Online Material Materials & Methods cDNAs and Protein expression Full - length arfaptin2 in the expression vector pGEX6P2 was a gift from Steve Gamblin ( National Institute for Medical Research , London , UK ) , and the cDNA for Drosophila amphiphysin was a gift from Cahir O’Kane ( Univ . of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK ) . cDNA for centaurin β 2 ( KIAA0041 ) was a gift from the Kazusa DNA research institute , Chiba , Japan . cDNAs for human BRAP1 / Bin2 ( 5722815 ) , mouse nadrin2 ( 3500822 ) were gifts from the I . M . A . G . E . consortium . Oligophrenin1 was cloned from a rat brain library , and amphiphysin1 ( residues 1 - 377 ) and 2 ( residues 1 - 422 ) were cloned from a rat brain library as previously described ( S1 ) . Derivatives and mutants were subcloned into pGEX4T1 or 4T2 , expressed in E . coli BL21 cells , purified by glutathione - affinity , cleaved with thrombin , and further purified by ion exchange chromatography before use . Clathrin was purified from rat brain as described on www2 . mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk / groups / hmm / techniqs / CCVprep . htm . CD spectra were measured at 20°C in 5mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl using a Jobin Yvon CD6 . Protein crystallization Drosophila amphiphysin ( residues 1 - 245 ) was expressed as an NH 2 - terminal GST fusion protein in minimal medium supplemented with selenomethionine . The protein was purified as above . Crystals were grown by vapour diffusion from a 2 . 5mg / ml protein solution in 18 % PEG4000 , 200mM NaCl , 1mM DTT , 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 mixed with the well solution 18 % PEG 4000 , 0 . 2M ammonium acetate , 100mM sodium citrate pH 6 . 0 . Crystals were equilibrated in 20 % glycerol for cooling to 100K . The crystal asymmetric unit contains one molecule , and the crystals belong to spacegroup P3 1 21 , cell dimensions a = b = 49 . 6Å , c = 190 . 3Å , γ = 120° . A single - wavelength X - ray diffraction dataset was collected to 2 . 6Å resolution at the Se edge at ESRF beamline ID29 ( Table S1 ) . Images were integrated with Mosflm ( S2 ) and scaled with Scala ( S3 ) . Two SeMet sites were located using the anomalous differences with the program Shake - and - Bake ( S4 ) . An additional two anomalous scattering sites at positions of the cysteine sulphur atoms were added during phasing by Sharp ( S5 ) . Phases were improved by solvent flattening with Solomon ( S6 ) . The model was built with O ( S7 ) and refined with Refmac ( S8 ) . Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL - A analytical ultracentrifuge with an An60 - Ti rotor , in 10mM Tris Cl , pH 7 . 4 , 200mM NaCl , 1mM TCEP . Sedimentation was at 11 , 000 rev / min , 20 . 0°C , with initial overspeeding at 18 , 000 rev / min for 6hr , to reduce the time to reach equilibrium ( S9 ) . Long sample columns were used , with cells loaded at a variety of initial concentrations . Scans ( averaging 10 readings ) were taken at 280nm at 24hr intervals , until no movement of the distribution was visible , when final scans ( averaging 100 readings ) were taken and assumed to be operationally at equilibrium . The rotor was then accelerated to pull the macromolecule away from the meniscus , and further scans taken to provide initial estimates of the baseline for each cell . Data were analyzed as described in detail in the supplementary information to ( S10 ) . Sequence alignments We first obtained a general BAR sequence alignment by overlaying the Drosophila amphiphysin and arfaptin2 BAR structures ( see Figs . 1E and S5 ) . Candidate BAR domain proteins were identified using repeated iterations of Psi - BLAST ( www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / BLAST / ) against the arfaptin and amphiphysin BAR domains . The BAR domains in these proteins were tested by aligning them with the Drosophila amphiphysin and arfaptin BAR domains using the clustalW function in MacVector , with an open gap penalty of 100 , extend gap penalty of 0 . 5 and delay divergent setting of 40 % . Generally when the third protein led to a correct alignment of the amphiphysin and arfaptin BARs , some charge conservation and a repeat of hydrophobic residues ( green in Fig 1E ) could be detected in the third BAR . Finally , candidate BARs were checked for α - helical content using Coils and Multicoil tools available at http : / / us . expasy . org / tools / . There should be caution in simple predictions of BAR domains given that α - helical repeats and coiled - coils are common in proteins . Liposome sedimentation , tubulation , and lipid monolayer assays Liposomes consisting either of 40 % phosphatidylcholine , 40 % phosphatidylethanolamine , 10 % cholesterol , and 10 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) , total bovine brain lipids ( Folch fraction 1 , sigma B1502 ; referred to in text as brain liposomes ) or total liver lipids ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) were resuspended at 1mg / ml in 20mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl ( 200mM NaCl for Drosophila amphiphysin ) , 1mM DTT and sized by extrusion ( S11 ) . For sedimentation assays , 5 µ M protein was incubated with 0 . 6mg / ml liposomes in 100 µ l of buffer for several minutes before sedimentation at 140000xg for 15 minutes in a Beckman TLA100 rotor . After spinning , supernatants were removed immediately , and pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of buffer . Proteins were subjected to SDS - PAGE , visualized by Coomassie stain , photographed with a Bio - Rad XRS system , and quantified using ImageQuant ( Molecular Dynamics ) . For tubulation assays , proteins were incubated as above , spread on glow - discharged carbon - coated grids and negatively stained with 5 % uranyl acetate . Mutations tested are described in the text , with the exception of arginines 65 and 68 in Drosophila amphiphysin , which were also mutated to glutamate but had no effect on binding or tubulation . Clathrin recruitment and lipid monolayer assays were performed at 20°C in 25mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 125mM potassium acetate , 5mM magnesium acetate , 1mM DTT . Monolayers composed of either brain lipids or synthetic lipid mixes ( which gave identical results ) were formed on a 40 µ l buffer drop in a Teflon well . A carbon - coated grid was placed on the droplet , proteins were injected underneath , and after 60min the grid was removed and negatively stained . A detailed protocol can be found on www2 . mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk / groups / hmm / techniqs / techniqs . htm . Transfections and immunofluorescence COS - 7 cells were transfected with pCMV - myc vectors using GeneJuice TM ( Novagen ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . 28 h after transfection , cells were transferred to serum - free medium and incubated with biotinylated transferrin for 15 min before fixation with 4 % PFA . Transfected cells were detected using a polyclonal anti - Myc tag antibody ( Cell Signalling ) , biotinylated transferrin was detected with labelled avidin , amphiphysin1 and arfaptin were detected with rabbit antisera raised against purified proteins , and TGN46 was detected with an anti - TGN46 antibody ( Serotech ) . Cells were mounted and imaged using a Radiance confocal system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . It should be noted that the amphiphysin constructs are not NH 2 - terminally tagged as this prevents the tubulation in vivo ( Fig . S3A ) , although in vitro an NH 2 - terminal histidine - or glutathione - S - transferase - tag does not prevent tubulation . Supplemental figures Fig . S1 . Analytical ultracentrifugation of Drosophila amphiphysin N - BAR The figure shows a plot of M w , app against concentration ( left ) , overlaying the individual cells , and also plots of the residuals for each cell against radius ( right ) . In practice , the correction factor for M 1 was close to 1 . 0 , while the concentration correction was < 0 . 05 absorbance units . The line plotted on the M w , app figure was calculated with M 1 = 40kDa and K d = 6 µ M , as derived from the fitting . The correspondence of the data with this line and , even more , the small and randomly distributed residuals for fitting the raw data , confirm that the Drosophila amphiphysin N - BAR reversibly dimerized under these conditions . Similar results were obtained for full - length arfaptin and centaurin β 2 BAR + PH .

S2 . Folding of an NH 2 - terminal amphipathic helix ( A ) Sequence alignment of predicted amphipathic helices in the the NH 2 - termini of proteins containing an N - BAR domain . Many other BAR - containing proteins do not contain this helix and thus this may help to define BAR domain subfamilies . Hydrophobic residues are highlighted in yellow , basic residues in blue , and acidic residues in red . Rvs161p , Rvs167p and Hob are yeast homologs of amphiphysin / endophilin . Abbreviations , d , Drosophila ; r , rat ; h , human ; Cele , C . elegans ; Sc , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Spombe , Schizosaccharomyces pombe ; m , mouse . ( B ) Top , Circular dichroism ( CD ) spectra of the N - BAR ( residues 1 - 244 ) or BAR ( residues 27 - 244 ) domain of Drosophila amphiphysin taken in the presence or absence of brain lipid liposomes . Minima at 208 and 222 nm indicate helical content ; the deepening of the second minimum is typical of an increase in α - helix content . Similar results were obtained with rat amphiphysin1 . Bottom , Control CD spectra showing the spectrum of liposomes only , and the effect of liposomes on Epsin1 ENTH ( Epsin NH 2 - terminal homology domain ) , which folds an extra α - helix upon lipid binding ( S12 ) . The folding of the NH 2 - terminal amphipathic helix in amphiphysin could aid tubulation by direct interaction with the membrane , by protein - protein interactions between dimers , or both , but we cannot distinguish them at present . In solution , analytical ultracentrifugation showed no aggregation beyond a dimer , but higher oligomers were detected by crosslinking on liposomes ( not shown ) . Mutation of phenylalanine 9 to glutamate in amphiphysin1 reduced but did not abolish tubulation ( Fig . 2E ) , in contrast to the effect seen in endophilin ( S13 ) . Mutation of lysine 15 ( in Drosophila amphiphysin ) or lysines 15 and 16 ( in mammalian amphiphysin1 ) to glutamates had little effect . Fig . S3 . Tubulation by BAR - containing proteins in vivo COS - 7 cells were transfected with pCMV vectors expressing NH 2 - terminally myc - tagged amphiphysin1 ( Amph1 ) , untagged amphiphysin1 , BRAP1 / Bin2 N - BAR , and centaurin β 2 BAR + PH . Scale bar = 20 µ m . ( A ) Expression of NH 2 - terminally myc - tagged amphiphysin does not cause tubulation , while expression of the untagged protein does . ( B ) Expression of the wild - type N - BAR of BRAP1 / Bin2 also causes tubulation , while the K163E + K165E mutant does not . ( C ) Overexpression of centaurin β 2 BAR + PH causes extensive tubulation and a defect in transferrin trafficking . In many cases these tubules emanated from foci within the cell but we were not able to identify the compartment . However , the PH domain of centaurin β 2 has been reported to bind PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( S14 ) a lipid implicated in endosome to multivesicular body trafficking ( S15 ) . Fig . S4 . Recruitment and polymerization of clathrin by amphiphysin ( A ) Rat amphiphysin2 ( rAmph2 ) was incubated with rat brain clathrin in the presence or absence of brain liposomes before sedimentation at 140000xg for 15min . In the Coomassie - stained gel , the first four lanes show the results obtained with wild - type protein and the last four lanes show the results obtained with the BAR mutant . Proteins in the pellet ( P ) or supernatant ( S ) were separated by SDS - PAGE . rAmph2 mut1 has the mutations K164E + K166E and was much less effective at recruiting clathrin to the membrane . Under these conditions no clathrin sedimented in the absence of other proteins . ( B ) Lipid monolayer assay demonstrating the ability of rAmph2 to recruit and polymerize clathrin . In the absence of amphiphysin , very little clathrin was on the monolayer , although occasionally a clathrin cage was seen ( top left panel ) . When wild type rAmph2 was incubated with clathrin in the absence of lipid , the rAmph2 induced extensive polymerization of the clathrin into cages , which stuck to the grid ( top right panel ) . However , in the presence of brain lipids , rAmph2 recruited clathrin and induced the formation of extensive lattices on the monolayers ( lower left panel ) . The monolayers now had a high background of clathrin , and some individual clathrin triskelia were discerned ( circle ) . Furthermore much of the clathrin was polymerized into lattice structures on the monolayer which were slightly invaginated given the presence of pentagons ( arrows ) . In contrast the mut1 rAmph2 monolayers showed a lower background of triskelia , and now all of the polymerized clathrin was in the form of cages . Cages sitting on the surface of the monolayer can be distinguished from lattices by ( a ) their more defined edges , ( b ) their higher electron density owing to accumulated stain inside the cage , and ( c ) less definition of their triskelia , together resulting in a ringlike appearance . Thus mut1 rAmph2 still polymerized clathrin in solution , which is expected as the dimerization interface and clathrin binding sites on amphiphysin were unchanged . However , mutations in the BAR seriously inhibited the ability of amphiphysin to form ordered clathrin structures on the membrane . Fig . S5 .

Movie S1 . Structure of Drosophila amphiphysin BAR Ribbon representation ( with a translucent electrostatic surface ) of the Drosophila amphiphysin BAR structure rotating through a full revolution . There is a buried accessible surface area per monomer of 2380 Å , and water filled cavities are in red . Helices 2 and 3 are kinked , and the kink in helix 3 is more pronounced . These kinks could introduce limited flexibility that would influence the local curvature of the bound membrane .
