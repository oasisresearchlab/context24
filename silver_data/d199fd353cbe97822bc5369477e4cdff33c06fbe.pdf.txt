The eﬀect of the ﬁlament - obstacle interaction on the force - velocity relation of a growing biopolymer F . Motahari and A . E . Carlsson ∗ Department of Physics and Center for Engineering Mechanobiology , Washington University , St . Louis , Missouri 63130 , USA ( Dated : December 4 , 2018 ) We investigate the eﬀect of ﬁlament - obstacle interactions on the force - velocity relation of grow - ing biopolymers , via calculations explicitly treating obstacle diﬀusion and stochastic addition and subtraction of subunits . We ﬁrst show that the subunit on - and oﬀ - rates satisfy a rigorous thermo - dynamic relationship determined by the ﬁlament - obstacle interaction potential . Both the on - and oﬀ - rates depend not only on the average force on the obstacle , but also on the shape of the potential on the nanometer length scale . Basing obstacle - induced reduction of the on - rate entirely on the force overestimates the stall force when there are ﬂuctuations in the force exerted on a ﬁlament tip . We then perform simulations and analytic calculations using the thermodynamic relationship . We ﬁnd , consistent with expectations from general thermodynamic relations , that the “Brownian - Ratchet” model is an upper bound to the growth velocity and that for purely repulsive potentials the growth velocity is essentially that predicted by the Brownian - Ratchet model . For shallow potential wells of depth ∼ 5 k B T , which might correspond to transient ﬁlament - membrane attachments , the zero - force velocity is a substantial fraction of the free - ﬁlament velocity . In this case , the growth velocity can depend strongly on the obstacle diﬀusion coeﬃcient even when the dimensionless diﬀusion coeﬃcient is large . The velocity also drops more rapidly than predicted by the Brownian - ratchet model , in some cases by as much as a factor of 50 at an opposing force of 1 pN . For deep potential wells , as might result from strong ﬁlament - membrane links , both the on - and oﬀ - rates are reduced signiﬁ - cantly , slowing polymerization . Such potentials can sustain pulling forces while polymerizing , but only if the attractive well has a “shelf” comparable to or greater than the monomer size . For such potentials , the slowing of polymerization by external force is almost linear . 1 . INTRODUCTION Polymerization of biopolymers such as actin ﬁlaments provides force to drive both protrusion and invagination of the cell membrane . This process is modulated by the interaction between the ﬁlament tip and the membrane , which varies considerably between diﬀerent cellular phenomena . In lamellipodia , ﬁlaments are likely weakly bound to the membrane by their interaction with , for example , WASP - family actin - nucleating proteins [ 1 ] . On the other hand , in ﬁlopodia actin ﬁlaments are nucleated by formins , which can bind actin ﬁlaments strongly [ 2 ] . Furthermore , in processes that require strong pulling forces to bend the membrane , such as endocytosis in yeast , some actin ﬁlaments must be strongly bound to the endocytic site . In this process , the binding is believed to result from the protein Sla2 , which has both actin - binding domain and a domain that links it to the membrane . [ 3 ] . Recent super - resolution experiments have shown that WASP ( Las17 in yeast ) forms a ring around a Sla2 dot [ 4 ] , and pulling forces are probably concentrated in the dot [ 5 , 6 ] . Similarly , microtubule interactions with the cell membrane are mediated by a range of proteins , which may lead to a variety of eﬀective interaction potentials [ 7 , 8 ] . In all of these cases , it is important to understand how the interaction between a growing ﬁlament and the membrane plus associated proteins aﬀects the polymerization rate . The ﬁlament - membrane interaction may be optimized for diﬀerent criteria , such as polymerization velocity where migration speed is crucial , or stability where strong pulling forces are required . Most previous calculations of force generation by polymerization have used hard wall repulsive potentials acting between the ﬁlament tip and the obstacle . The classic Brownian ratchet ( BR ) model [ 9 ] used such a potential to treat polymerization in the presence of a diﬀusing obstacle , assuming that the monomer on - rate increases suddenly from zero to its free - ﬁlament value at a certain distance from the membrane . Analysis of this model showed that in the limit of fast obstacle diﬀusion , the hard - wall potential gives rise to a growth velocity that decays exponentially with opposing force : v growth = δ [ k 0 on exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) − k 0 off ] , ( 1 ) ∗ Electronic address : aec @ wustl . edu a r X i v : 1 8 12 . 00061v1 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 3 0 N ov 2018 Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 2 where δ is the step size per added subunit , and k 0 on , off are the free - ﬁlament on - and oﬀ - rates . Calculations based on this analysis can qualitatively explain the mechanism behind the generation of pushing forces by actin polymerization in several types of cellular protrusions , such as ﬁlopodial and lamellipodial protrusions [ 10 – 19 ] . The basic features of intracellular motion of pathogens such as Listeria , which is driven by actin polymerization , can also be explained by BR - type models . I should also see if the geometry aﬀects the eﬃciency ( eout over ein ) more than it aﬀects eout . However , the true interaction is continuously varying and the force may have both attractive and repulsive com - ponents . It is not known how these variations aﬀect the force - velocity relation . For example , a potential with a deep well might trap the growing end of the ﬁlament near the obstacle , and thus slow polymerization . On the other hand , a smoother potential might speed polymerization . A small number of calculations have treated such smoothly varying potentials . Calculations in 2D using an explicitly moving obstacle with explicitly diﬀusing monomers to treat the growth rate of a single actin ﬁlament , interacting with an obstacle via a steeply increasing force ﬁeld , found that the velocity decays more rapidly than the BR prediction [ 20 ] . This eﬀect was attributed to a diﬀusion barrier in which monomers had to traverse a tunnel - like region to reach their binding site at the end of the ﬁlament . Such eﬀects are expected to be smaller in 3D . Calculations using a range of force ﬁelds to treat 3D polymerization [ 21 , 22 ] , including ﬁlament bending , found large acceleration of growth by a soft obstacle when the obstacle diﬀusion coeﬃcient was small . Refs . [ 23 ] and [ 24 ] considered actin ﬁlaments strongly bound to the obstacle , but assumed they did not grow . Studies of ﬁlament growth while clamped to a motile obstacle via a deep potential energy well suggested that the ﬁlament - obstacle attachment is the controlling factor for the elongation rate [ 25 , 26 ] . A later model considered ﬁlaments attached to an obstacle with a double - well potential [ 27 ] , explicitly treating diﬀusive motion of the obstacle . It was found that a ﬁlament can push the obstacle and grow with a speed of about half of the free ﬁlament speed and thus progressively polymerize , if the potential is suﬃciently deep . Among these preceding studies , there is no systematic exploration of a broad range of possible force ﬁelds , to establish how the force ﬁeld inﬂuences the force - velocity relation . In fact , the methodology for performing calculations with smoothly varying ﬁlament - obstacle interactions is not well established . One must choose spatial dependences for both the interaction energy between the obstacle and the ﬁlament tip , and the polymerization rate parameters . In previous work these dependences have often been chosen independently . Here we establish a thermodynamic relationship between the spatial dependence of the polymerization - rate pa - rameters and that of the interaction energy , simplifying the construction of appropriate force - generation models . This relationship applies to a ﬁlament growing against a diﬀusing obstacle whose motion is treated explicitly , with a smoothly varying ﬁlament - obstacle interaction . Performing calculations without this relationship can lead to an incorrect stall force . In our implementation , either the on - rate or oﬀ - rate is reduced , depending on the form of the interaction potential ; neither is increased . We then perform a systematic set of simulations for a broad range of possible ﬁlament - obstacle interaction potentials , treating polymerization and depolymerization as well as obstacle motion stochastically . We ﬁnd that monotonically decaying repulsive potentials lead to force - velocity relations very similar to the BR prediction , as expected from general thermodynamic principles . Weak attractive potentials both reduce the zero - force velocity , and lead to a decay that is more rapid than the Brownian - ratchet prediction . Deep and narrow potentials lead to slow polymerization at all force values . We ﬁnd that attached ﬁlaments stop growing if the potential well is deep enough to sustain pulling forces greater than about 1pN , unless the potential well has a shelf comparable to the monomer size . Potentials with such a shelf have fairly rapid polymerization at zero force and have a force - velocity relation that decays almost linearly . Although the model is highly simpliﬁed , multiscale calculations such as those of Ref . [ 10 , 12 , 19 , 28 – 32 ] have demonstrated the utility of simple , but approximate results for the force - velocity relation in calculating the properties of cells and processes inside cells . The general understanding gained from the present studies will enhance the physical relevance of such multiscale calculations . 2 . MODEL 2 . 1 . Filament - Obstacle Interaction The model ( Figure 1 ) treats the stochastic polymerization of a biopolymer , exerting force on an explicitly moving , ﬂat , penetrable obstacle . We envisage the base of the ﬁlament as being rigidly anchored . Actin ﬁlaments , for example , could be anchored in a crosslinked actin meshwork . For conceptual simplicity the results presented here are for a ﬁlament growing perpendicular to the obstacle without bending ﬂuctuations ; results for a ﬁlament growing at an oblique angle , including membrane ﬂuctuations , are described in the Appendices . We treat a range of ﬁlament - Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 3 obstacle interactions given by smooth potential functions having the form U ( r ) = Ae − κ 1 r − Be − κ 2 r ( 2 ) or U ( r ) = Ae − κ 1 r − Ce − [ κ 3 ( r − r 1 ) ] 2 − De − [ κ 4 ( r − r 2 ) ] 2 ( 3 ) Here , A , B , C , D , κ 1 , κ 2 , κ 3 , κ 4 , r 1 , and r 2 are constants , and r is the variable gap between the tip of the ﬁlament and the obstacle . Filament - obstacle binding can be naturally included in the force ﬁeld via the B term in Eq . 2 ; we denote such a potential a “simple well” . A non - zero C in Eq . 3 also adds a Gaussian “spike” to the potential at r = r 1 which can be either attractive or repulsive . Choosing both C and D to be positive in Eq . 3 generates a double - well potential , as shown in Figure 2 ( b ) . The depth of the wells in the potentials represents the energy of binding ﬁlaments to membrane - bound proteins . The corresponding forces that the ﬁlament exerts on the obstacle are F ( r ) = − dU dr = Aκ 1 e − κ 1 r − Bκ 2 e − κ 2 r ( 4 ) and F ( r ) = Aκ 1 e − κ 1 r − 2 Cκ 32 ( r − r 1 ) e − [ κ 3 ( r − r 1 ) ] 2 − 2 Dκ 42 ( r − r 2 ) e − [ κ 4 ( r − r 2 ) ] 2 , ( 5 ) respectively . We will denote a ﬁlament having only repulsive potential terms a “pusher” . A ﬁlament with an interaction potential containing a well or a spike is denoted a “puller” ( although it can also exert a pushing force ) . Figure 1 . Schematic of model applied to an actin ﬁlament : r is the distance between the ﬁlament tip and the obstacle , δ is the actin monomer size = 2 . 7nm , and ∆ z obst is the obstacle position ﬂuctuation in the + z direction during a given time step . We treat the ﬁlament’s base as being solidly anchored . 2 . 2 . Obstacle Dynamics The obstacle position is stepped forward in time according to biased Brownian motion driven by F ( r ) and thermal ﬂuctuations . We use a “ﬁlament - centric” approach in our simulations , in which the ﬁlament base is assumed to be stationary and the obstacle moves . Cases where the ﬁlament base is moving can be handled by a simple coordinate transformation , in which obstacle motion is the inverse of the base motion and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the obstacle is replaced by that of the entity to which the ﬁlament is anchored .

[ 33 ] , Chap . 3 ) : ∆ z obst = α √ 24∆ t (cid:112) D obst + D obst k B T ∆ t [ F ( r ) + F load ] ( 6 ) where D obst is the obstacle diﬀusion constant , F load is the external force applied on the obstacle , ∆ t is the time step , and α is a random number uniformly distributed between − 12 and 12 , so that < α 2 > = 112 . Consecutive time steps are uncorrelated . 3 . RESULTS 3 . 1 . Thermodynamic Relation between k on ( r ) and k off ( r ) It is physically clear that at least k on must be modiﬁed as a ﬁlament tip approaches an obstacle , because there is less room available for new subunits to add . Some previous models [ 34 – 37 ] treated hard - wall potentials and considered ¯ k on , the addition rate averaged over a time long in comparison with the time scale of ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations . They argued that when the distance between the ﬁlament tip and the closest obstacle position to the ﬁlament tip in a multi - ﬁlament simulation is less then the monomer length increment δ , ¯ k on is reduced by a factor of exp [ − F ( δ − r ) / k B T ] relative to the free - ﬁlament value , where F is the time - averaged force exerted on the ﬁlament tip , and r is the distance between ﬁlament tip and the obstacle . This relationship holds when the force required to bend a ﬁlament tip is fairly constant over the size of a subunit . Here we show that a more complex relationship holds when the ﬁlament - obstacle interaction varies strongly over distances on the order of the subunit size . In such cases , it is necessary to include obstacle motion explicitly in the calculations . Then one uses rates k on ( r ) and k off ( r ) that refer to polymerization and depolymerization events occurring at a given ﬁlament - tip and obstacle position , rather than time - averaged rates . We consider polymerization of ﬁlaments in the absence of nonequilibrium eﬀects such as hydrolysis of ATP to ADP in actin . In this case , the stall force must be independent of the form of the interaction potential U ( r ) between the ﬁlament tip and the obstacle . This follows from the thermodynamic arguments of Ref . [ 38 ] : At the stall force , changes in chemical free energy resulting from polymerization precisely balance changes in mechanical energy , relating the stall force to the polymerization free energy per subunit . Then the combined system of obstacle and ﬁlament can be described by a free energy function , containing a mechanical term F ext z where F ext is the external force ( measured Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 5 Figure 3 . Dynamics of obstacle motion and actin ﬁlament polymerization and depolymerization . Red arrow corresponds to the polymerization rate at the point where the ﬁlament - obstacle gap is r o , and the blue arrows correspond to the depolymerization rates at r o and r o − δ . in the direction opposite to ﬁlament growth ) acting on an obstacle with coordinate z , a chemical term N ∆ G where N is the number of subunits in the ﬁlament and ∆ G is the chemical free - energy increment per added subunit , and U ( r ) . Deﬁning r to be the obstacle - tip distance , z = r + Nδ . Then the total free energy as a function of N and r is G tot = N ∆ G + NF ext δ + F ext r + U ( r ) . ( 7 ) Here the free energy is deﬁned on a time scale shorter than the time scale of monomer addition and obstacle motion but still long enough that the free energy of an actin monomer interacting with water molecules is well deﬁned . The stall force F stall is deﬁned by G tot being independent of N at a ﬁxed value of r , so that F stall = − ∆ G / δ , ( 8 ) as is well known [ 9 , 38 ] . This result implies [ 38 ] that F stall = ( k B T / δ ) ln ( k 0 on / k 0 off ) , ( 9 ) where k 0 on and k 0 off are rates for a free ﬁlament not interacting with an obstacle . Note that k 0 on is the on - rate ( having units of s − 1 ) , which is the product of the on - rate constant with the free - actin monomer concentration . Now consider the dynamics of the ﬁlament - obstacle system at the stall force . The system is in equilibrium and thus obeys detailed balance ( recall that ATP hydrolysis is neglected ) . Since the system is at the stall force , the free energy G tot = F stall · r + U ( r ) , ( 10 ) is independent of N . The dynamic processes in the system are i ) Brownian motion of the obstacle , ii ) polymerization , and iii ) depolymerization . In Figure 3 , Brownian motion leads to inﬁnitesimal steps in r , while polymerization leads to jumps r → r − δ and depolymerization leads to jumps r → r + δ . Because the system is in equilibrium , the probability distribution P ( r ; N ) satisﬁes the Boltzmann relation . In particular , referring to Figure 3 and ignoring normalization of P , P ( r ; N ) = exp { − [ U ( r ) + F stall · r ] / k B T } ( 11 ) P ( r − δ ; N + 1 ) = exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) + F stall · ( r − δ ) ] / k B T } Detailed balance between the states ( r ; N ) and ( r − δ ; N + 1 ) , which holds for this equilibrium system , implies that k on ( r ) P ( r ; N ) = k off ( r − δ ) P ( r − δ ; N + 1 ) ( 12 ) Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 6 Therefore , using Eq . 9 , k on ( r ) k off ( r − δ ) = exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } · exp ( F stall · δ / k B T ) = exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } · k 0 on k 0 off ( 13 ) This relationship guarantees that the correct stall force is obtained . It generalizes the well - known result [ 38 ] for the average rates that ¯ k on / ¯ k off = exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) k 0 on / k 0 off . ( 14 ) Eq . 14 follows from Eq . 13 in the limit D obst → ∞ . To see this , note that from Eq . 13 the rate constants have the form k off ( r ) = k 0 off f ( r ) k on ( r ) = k 0 on exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } f ( r − δ ) ( 15 ) where f is a function of r . When D obst → ∞ , the obstacle position distribution P ( r ) has its thermal equilibrium form P ( r ) = exp { − [ U ( r ) + Fr ] / k B T } / Z , where Z = (cid:82) ∞ −∞ exp { − [ U ( r ) + Fr ] / k B T } dr . Then ¯ k on = ( k 0 on / Z ) (cid:90) ∞ −∞ exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } exp { − [ U ( r ) + Fr ] / k B T } f ( r − δ ) dr = ( k 0 on / Z ) (cid:90) ∞ −∞ exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) ] / k B T } exp [ − Fr / k B T ] f ( r − δ ) dr = ( k 0 on / Z ) exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) (cid:90) ∞ −∞ exp [ − U ( r ) / k B T ] exp [ − Fr / k B T ] f ( r ) dr ( 16 ) while ¯ k off = ( k 0 off / Z ) (cid:90) ∞ −∞ exp [ − U ( r ) / k B T ] exp [ − Fr / k B T ] f ( r ) dr ( 17 ) = ¯ k on [ exp ( Fδ / k B T ) k 0 off / k 0 on ] , ( 18 ) implying that Eq . 14 holds . When obstacle diﬀusion is not rapid , Eq . 14 will not necessarily hold because energy is dissipated by the obstacle drag , which is inversely proportional to D obst according to the Einstein relation . This is not accounted for in the thermodynamic analysis . The stall force , however , is unaﬀected by obstacle drag because the obstacle is stationary on average . Eq . 13 correctly implies that the force - velocity relation is independent of the choice of zero for evaluating r . For example , adding a constant shift ∆ r to r would cause the typical positions sampled by the ﬁlament tip to move out a distance ∆ r from the obstacle , i . e . remaining close to the minimum of U ( r ) if the potential has a deep well . Then the values sampled by the factor exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } will also remain the same , corresponding to the energy diﬀerence between a point at the minimum and one shifted in by ∆ r from the minimum . This also implies that for the repulsive potential , the force - velocity relation is independent of the prefactor A ; changes in the prefactor can be accounted for by changing the zero of the r - coordinate , which does not aﬀect the force - velocity relation . This is conﬁrmed by our numerical simulations below . The derivation above applies to a single - stranded ﬁlament growing perpendicular to the obstacle . However , Eq . 13 holds for a broader range of models . If the ﬁlament grows at an angle of θ relative to the obstacle , then the schematic of Figure 3 holds provided that δ is replaced by δ cos ( θ ) , the step size per added subunit . Similarly , for multistranded ﬁlament growth Figure 3 applies provided that a new subunit can add only at a unique speciﬁed site ( typically next to the preceding one ) ; then δ is again the step size per added subunit . Thus Eq . 13 holds for both these cases . It also holds when ﬁlament bending degrees of freedom are included , and for systems of many ﬁlaments . If , for example , one describes the bending of a single ﬁlament by angle θ , then Figure 3 applies to transitions occurring at a given value of θ . Because detailed balance must hold for all transitions in a system at equilibrium , Eq . 13 will still hold . In systems of many ﬁlaments , Figure 3 would apply to a single ﬁlament , and again transitions involving just that ﬁlament must satisfy detailed balance at the stall force . Eq . 13 does not uniquely determine k on ( r ) and k off ( r ) . In our simulations , we make a minimal assumption , that Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 7 has frequently been used for the rates ¯ k on and ¯ k off , by preventing both rates from exceeding the free ﬁlament on and oﬀ rates : k on ( r ) = k 0 on exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } if U ( r − δ ) > U ( r ) k on ( r ) = k 0 on if U ( r − δ ) < U ( r ) ( 19 ) k off ( r ) = k 0 off exp { − [ U ( r + δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } if U ( r + δ ) > U ( r ) k off ( r ) = k 0 off if U ( r + δ ) < U ( r ) ( 20 ) Thus if U ( r ) is monotonically repulsive , there is no correction to k off in Eq . 20 . This assumption has been made in most previous calculations in the literature . We do not have strong arguments justifying the assumption , but have decided to make it here in order to avoid investigating an unwieldy set of possibilities . In the limit of a hard obstacle , where U ( r − δ ) jumps suddenly from 0 to ∞ when r becomes less than δ , k on ( r ) in Eq . 19 will vanish when r < δ and equal k 0 on otherwise , as in the BR analysis . For a slowly varying repulsive U ( r ) , force balance on the obstacle implies that typical values of r will satisfy dU / dr (cid:39) − F ext . Then U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) (cid:39) F ext δ , so that k on is reduced by the familiar exp ( − F ext δ / k B T ) factor . However , in the case of an interaction potential with a deep narrow well , the results can be quite diﬀerent . For vanishing external force on the obstacle , basing the slowing on the average obstacle force will give no correction . However , Eqs . 19 and 20 will give corrections to both k on and k off . The ﬁlament tip will generally be near the bottom of the well . Therefore both U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) and U ( r + δ ) − U ( r ) are positive , so that k on and k off are reduced . 3 . 2 . Numerical results for diﬀerent potentials and ﬁnite D obst We calculated the force - velocity relations for a range of ﬁlament - obstacle interaction potentials described above , including “pusher” and “single - well” potentials ( Figure 2a ) , and potentials having positive or negative Gaussian spikes as well as a double - well potential ( Figure 2b ) . The key parameter values are given in Table I . The free - ﬁlament polymerization rate k 0 on is taken for a concentration of 1 µM actin with an on - rate constant of 11 . 6 µM − 1 s − 1 [ 39 ] . Because the fractional error of the oﬀ - rate k 0 off measured in Ref . [ 39 ] is much larger than that of the on - rate constant , we have assigned it a rough estimate of 1 s − 1 corresponding to the general range of values in the literature . The obstacle diﬀusion coeﬃcient D obst is taken as that of a sphere of radius R = 5 µm , using the Stokes relation D obst = k B T / 6 πµR , where the viscosity µ is taken as that of cytoplasm , assumed to have a value 8 . 9 × 10 − 3 Pa · s ten times larger than that of water . This corresponds to relatively rapid diﬀusion according to the measure D obst / k 0 on δ 2 (cid:39) 50 [ 9 ] . Because TABLE I : Symbol deﬁnitions and parameter values .

The eﬀects of using lower values of D obst are described in Appendix B . The value of ﬁlament tip diﬀusion coeﬃcent D tip ( used in the calculations in Appendix A ) is unknown . Because the moving part of the ﬁlament is much smaller than the sphere that we treat as an obstacle , we choose D tip to be 10 times larger than D obst , fast enough to ensure that ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations are much faster Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 8 Figure 4 . Time course of ﬁlament length and obstacle motion for zero external force . Upper black curve is obstacle motion time course for a repulsive ﬁlament - obstacle interaction potential ( corresponding parameter values from Eq . 2 are : A = 54 . 7 pN · nm , B = 0 , and κ 1 = 0 . 9 nm − 1 ) and the lower black curve is the ﬁlament height vs . time . Upper blue curve is the time course of the obstacle motion for an potential with an attractive well of depth 5 k B T ( parameter values from Eq . 2 are : A = 71 . 6 pN · nm , B = 35 . 8 pN · nm , κ 1 = 0 . 9 nm − 1 , and κ 2 = 0 . 3 nm − 1 ) with lower blue curve showing the ﬁlament height . Inset shows discrete polymerization and depolymerization steps , as well as the obstacle ﬂuctuations against the ﬁlament tip . than obstacle ﬂuctuations . We show results for a rigid ﬁlament growing at perpendicular incidence . Results for a ﬂuctuating ﬁlament tip , growing at oblique incidence , are given in Appendix A . Figure 4 shows sample time courses of ﬁlament length and obstacle position at zero load for two diﬀerent force ﬁelds . The black curves correspond to a “soft” repulsive potential ( see Figure 2a ) . The ﬁlament grows at roughly the free - ﬁlament rate and the obstacle has excursions of 100 nm or more away from the ﬁlament tip . The blue curves correspond to a force ﬁeld with an attractive well ( Figure 2a ) of depth 5 k B T . Here the growth is slower by about 50 % . The obstacle excursions are smaller on average . Although there are several “mini - excursions” of tens of nm , the obstacle returns to the ﬁlament . We consider this case to correspond to transient attachment of the ﬁlament to the obstacle . However , later in the time course ( at around 11 sec ) , the obstacle has an excursion similar to that seen for repulsive potential . Eventually , the ﬁlament will catch up to the obstacle and the excursions will diminish . Figure 5 shows the calculated force - velocity relations for the range of potentials considered . For all the potentials , the growth velocity lies at or below the BR prediction . This is expected from the assumption ( Eqs . 19 and 20 ) that k off ≤ k 0 off : Eq . 14 implies that ¯ k on − ¯ k off = k 0 on exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) f ( F ) − k 0 off f ( F ) , where f ( F ) ≤ 1 . Then ¯ k on − ¯ k off = f ( F ) [ k 0 on exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) − k 0 off ] , below the BR prediction . For all purely repulsive potentials , the force - velocity relation is essentially indistinguishable from the BR prediction . This again follows from Eq . 14 , 19 , and 20 . For repulsive potentials Eqs . 19 and 20 imply that k off ( r ) = ¯ k off = k off ( 0 ) , so that ¯ k on = k 0 on exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) and the BR relation holds . Simple - well potentials , as well as potentials having negative spikes and double wells ( Figure 2b ) , lead to slow - ing of growth relative to the BR model in the positive ( pushing ) force regime . For a well depth of 5 k B T , the zero - force velocity is about half of the free - ﬁlament velocity , larger than might have been expected from the exp { − [ U ( r − δ ) − U ( r ) ] / k B T } factor in Eq . 19 , which is approximately exp ( − 5 ) in the case of the Gaussian spike when the obstacle is near the bottom of the potential well . The reason for the faster growth is that in the absence of external force , the obstacle is outside the well a substantial fraction of the time . To see this , we assume fast obstacle diﬀusion and exploit the fact that the growth of the ﬁlament tip at veloc - ity v toward the obstacle has the same eﬀect on the distance distribution P ( r ) as a weak external eﬀective force F eff = k B Tv / D obst [ 9 ] . This holds because the equation of motion for P ( r ) in the presence of ﬁlament growth ( taken to have a constant velocity , and using the Einstein relation ) is ∂P / ∂t = D obst ∂ 2 P / ∂r 2 + [ F ( r ) D obst / k B T + v ] ∂P / ∂r , while the equation of motion in the presence of a constant force F eff is ∂P / ∂t = D obst ∂ 2 P / ∂r 2 + { [ F ( r ) + F eff ] D obst / k B T } ∂P / ∂r . We assume the obstacle to be in either the region of the potential well , where we ignore polymerization , or in the region outside the well , where it polymerizes at the free - ﬁlament velocity v 0 . This picture is most applicable to narrow wells , such as the “Negative Spike” treated in Figure 5c . The polymerization rate is then v / v 0 = Z free / ( Z well + Z free ) , Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 9 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 5 . Simulated force - velocity relation for several diﬀerent forms of ﬁlament - obstacle interaction potential . Error bars are smaller than the symbols , except indicated ; and they are calculated by ﬁnding the standard deviation of the mean for growth velocity , from 20 diﬀerent simulations of 20 seconds . The dashed line is the prediction of the BR model at large diﬀusion constant values for obstacle . Data points for pullers are shown out to forces where they detach from the obstacle . Frames ( a ) and ( b ) are for potentials in Figure 2a , while ( c ) and ( d ) are for potentials in Figure 2b . where Z well is the contribution to the obstacle’s partition function from the well region and Z free is the contribution from outside the well . We take Z free = (cid:90) ∞ 0 exp ( − F eff · r / k B T ) dr = k B T F eff = D obst v ( 21 ) where we have taken the integral to extend from 0 to ∞ for mathematical simplicity , which is valid as long as F eff is weak . This gives v v 0 = 1 1 + Z well / Z free = 1 1 + Z well v / D obst ( 22 ) The solution to this equation is v v 0 = 2 1 + √ 1 + 4 η , ( 23 ) Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 10 where η = v 0 Z well / D obst . Treating the “Negative 5 k B T Spike” as a square well of depth 5 k B T and width 2 nm , we obtain Z well = 2 nm · e 5 and v / v 0 = 0 . 52 , roughly consistent with the numerical results in Figure 5c . The growth velocity given by Eq . 23 is appreciable only if η (cid:46) 1 , so that D obst (cid:38) v 0 Z well . Therefore , even though D obst / k 0 on δ 2 > > 1 , the growth velocity depends strongly on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient . For the potentials with 5 k B T wells , the velocity also decays more rapidly with opposing force than the BR relation predicts . For example , the “5 k B T” curve in Figure 5a drops by nearly 75 % already at 1 pN force , while the BR model and repulsive force ﬁelds drop by only about 50 % . For the “Negative 5 k B T” spike in Figure 5c , the drop is practically down to zero . This rapid drop occurs because the external force reduces the statistical weight of the free region , which becomes Z free = k B T / ( F eff + F ext ) . Substituting this into Eq . 22 gives v v 0 = 2 1 + ˜ f + (cid:113) ( 1 + ˜ f ) 2 + 4 η , ( 24 ) where ˜ f = Z well F ext / k B T . Even small values of F ext can aﬀect the velocity strongly , because of the Z well factor in ˜ f . Solving Eq . 24 , again using a square well of depth 5 k B T and width 2 nm , we ﬁnd v / v 0 = 0 . 014 at F ext = 1 pN , consistent with the very rapid drop seen in Figure 5c . When diﬀusion is very rapid , η → 0 , and v / v 0 (cid:39) 1 / ( 1 + ˜ f ) . ( 25 ) Taking ( 1 / v ) ( − dv / dF ext ) ≥ 2 δ / k B T at zero force ( twice the BR value ) as a deﬁnition of rapid decay with force , we ﬁnd that rapid decay will occur when Z well (cid:38) 6 nm . For the double - well potential ( Figure 5d ) , the velocity decays less rapidly relative to its F = 0 value than the BR prediction ( although the magnitude of v growth is always smaller than the BR result ) ; in fact the drop is almost linear . Another feature of the systems with potential wells is that they can polymerize processively under pulling ( negative ) force , over a limited time [ 27 ] . As expected physically , there is a tradeoﬀ between maximum sustainable force and polymerization rate . High pulling force enhances polymerization , but at the same time accelerates detachment of the obstacle from the ﬁlament . For a 5 k B T potential depth , almost no pulling force can be sustained over 20 seconds ( Figure 5a ) . But for a 15 k B T depth ( Figure 5b ) , a force of about 1 pN can be sustained over 20 seconds . The growth velocity in this case is about 80 % greater than the zero - force value , but much lower than for the 5 k B T case . For the 25 k B T potential still larger pulling forces can be sustained , at an even smaller growth rate . Figs . 5 ( c ) and Figure 5d show that the same trade - oﬀ occurs for potentials with spikes . The trade - oﬀ is explicitly illustrated in Figure 6 . Frame a ) shows how the maximum pulling force that allows a 20 - second attachment period , depends on the depth of the potential well . Frame b ) shows how the growth velocity depends on the well depth . These two plots show that large sustainable pulling forces on the obstacle ( greater than about 1 pN ) come at the expense of greatly reduced growth velocity . Pullers with a well depth of about 5 k B T grows only half as fast as a free ﬁlament , but can sustain essentially no pulling force . If the depth is larger than about 15 k B T , which is needed to sustain pN forces , growth almost completely stops . The only form of potential used here that achieves a reasonable growth rate at a substantial pulling force is the double - well potential ( Figure 2b ) . As shown in Figure 5d , this potential eliminates the trade - oﬀ between sustainable force and polymerization rate that is seen with other potentials . This is because the well is wide enough that polymerization can occur inside even a very deep well . If the obstacle is pulled toward the large - r end of the well , U ( r − δ ) and U ( r ) do not diﬀer greatly , so there is no signiﬁcant slowing in Eq . 19 . 4 . DISCUSSION Our main ﬁndings are the following : • The ratio of the on - and oﬀ - rates depends on the details of the interaction potential with the obstacle on a nanometer scale ( see Eq . 13 ) . This implies that even at zero force , a deep well in the interaction potential can dramatically slow both polymerization and depolymerization . Polymerization is slowed because of the high - energy conﬁguration assumed by the ﬁlament tip after addition of a new subunit , while depolymerization is slowed because removal of an existing subunit also leaves the ﬁlament in a high - energy conﬁguration . Eq . 13 is automatically satisﬁed by calculations implementing the BR approximation that k on ( r ) = 0 when the ﬁlament tip is within a distance δ of a hard obstacle with no attractive well , but k on ( r ) = k 0 on beyond that distance . Not all single - ﬁlament calculations in the literature treating obstacle motion explicitly have satisﬁed the con - straint of Eq . 13 . We note that Eq . 13 does not apply to calculations such as as those of Refs . [ 20 ] , which ignored depolymerization . Ref . [ 22 ] assumed a variation of the on - rate resulting from the interaction potential with the obstacle , but it did not appear to satisfy Eq . 13 . On the other hand , Ref . [ 27 ] used a relationship very Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 11 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 6 . Eﬀect of binding strength of single - well potential on a ) the maximum pulling force allowing attachment up to 20 seconds , and b ) the growth velocity at zero external load . similar to Eq . 13 , in which the exponential factor corresponded to the energy diﬀerence between binding in two diﬀerent positions in a double - well potential . Some works treating force generation by actin networks stochastically have also treated smoothly varying tip - obstacle interactions [ 4 , 40 – 45 ] . In all of these works , actin polymerization was slowed by the obstacle . But none of the treatments satisﬁes Eq . 13 exactly . Ref . [ 40 ] used an approximate version in which the U ( r ) term in the exponential of Eq . 13 is ignored . In Refs . [ 41 ] and [ 42 ] , the mechanical energy , including the membrane deformation / position and states of actin ﬁlament bending , was minimized after each polymerization event . To evaluate the on - rate , the energy was reminimized with a hypothetical next subunit in place . The resulting energy diﬀerence ∆ U was used in a Boltzmann factor slowing the polymerization . This approach is similar in spirit to Eq . 13 , but diﬀers in that the energy is minimized in calculating ∆ U . In the context of the systems treated here , this would correspond to placing the obstacle , before and after the addition of the new subunit , at the minimum of the potential U ( r ) + F · r . Then ∆ U = Fδ , giving a slowing of the growth velocity of a single ﬁlament by a factor of exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) . As found above , this is correct provided there is no attractive well in the potential . Refs . [ 4 , 43 – 45 ] used criteria based on force rather than energy diﬀerence . In such approaches , even plausible assumptions regarding the slowing of actin polymerization can lead to substantial errors in the stall force . For example , one can assume [ 4 ] that a ﬁlament tip experiences a linear force F ( r ) = − k c rθ ( − r ) when in contact with the obstacle , and that this force slows polymerization according to k on ( r ) = k 0 on exp [ − F ( r ) δ / k B T ] , ( 26 ) while k off ( r ) = k 0 off is not aﬀected . This corresponds to applying the thermodynamic result Eq . 14 , for the averaged rate ¯ k on , to the instantaneous rate k on ( r ) . The force - velocity relation can be obtained exactly for this model in the limit D obst → ∞ . Using the same analysis as used to derive Eq . 16 , but incorporating Eq . 26 , we obtain ¯ k on = ( k 0 on / Z ) (cid:90) ∞ −∞ exp [ − F ( r ) δ / k B T ] exp { − [ U ( r ) + F ext · r ] / k B T } dr = ( k 0 on / Z ) (cid:34)(cid:114) πk B T 2 k c exp { [ F ext − k c δ ] 2 / 2 k c k B T } { 1 + erf [ ( F ext − k c δ ) / (cid:112) ( 2 k c k B T ) ] } + k B T / F ext (cid:35) ( 27 ) where U ( r ) = k c θ ( − r ) r 2 / 2 and Z = (cid:114) πk B T 2 k c exp ( F 2 ext / 2 k c k B T ) { 1 + erf ( F ext / (cid:112) ( 2 k c k B T ) } + k B T / F ext . ( 28 ) Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 12 The stall force for this model can be obtained by numerically locating the zero of ¯ k on − ¯ k off . In the limit of large stall force ( F ext − k c δ > > √ 2 k c k B T ) , Eq . 27 simpliﬁes . The error functions in Eqs . 27 and 28 approach unity , and the 1 / F ext terms can be ignored . Thus ¯ k on (cid:39) k 0 on exp ( − F ext δ / k B T ) exp ( k c δ 2 / 2 k B T ) . Solving for ¯ k on = ¯ k off we obtain F stall = ( k B T / δ ) ln ( k 0 on / k 0 off ) + k c δ / 2 , ( 29 ) which exceeds the thermodynamic stall force by the amount k c δ / 2 . Numerically , both from Eq . 27 and from our stochastic simulations with a large but ﬁnite D obst , we ﬁnd comparable overestimates of the stall force in other parameter ranges . The overestimates are equally large in parameter ranges where ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations dominate . For the spring constant assumed in Ref . [ 4 ] we obtain a stall force of 50 pN , about ﬁve times too high given the assumed actin concentration . We emphasize that these results hold only when thermal motion of the obstacle or ﬁlament tip is explicitly treated rather than being averaged out . Why does Eq . 27 , which appears to correctly implement the force dependence of actin polymerization by equating the instantaneous rates to the known results ( Eq . 14 ) for the average rates , fail to obtain the correct stall force ? The reason is that although the force F ( t ) acting on the tip of a ﬁlament polymerizing under an average force F ext satisﬁes ¯ F = F ext , the ﬂuctuating motion of the obstacle or the ﬁlament tip causes the tip to experience a range of forces described by a distribution p ( F ) , so that ¯ k on = k 0 on (cid:90) ∞ −∞ p ( F ) exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) dF ( 30 ) Since the exponential is convex upwards ( the second derivative of exp ( − Fδ / k B T ) is positive ) , ¯ k on will exceed k on ( ¯ F ) , leading to an overestimate of the stall force . If one assumes that p ( F ) ∝ exp [ ( F − ¯ F ) 2 / 2∆ F 2 ] where ∆ F 2 is the variance of F , Eq . 30 shows that ¯ k on = k 0 on exp [ − ¯ Fδ / k B T ] exp [ δ 2 ∆ F 2 / 2 ( k B T ) 2 ] . Setting this equal to k 0 off , one ﬁnds F stall = ( k B T / δ ) ln ( k 0 on / k 0 off ) + ∆ F 2 δ / 2 k B T . ( 31 ) For force ﬂuctuations induced by thermal motion in a harmonic potential , ∆ F 2 = ∆ r 2 k 2 c = k c k B T , and Eq . 31 is identical to Eq . 29 . On the other hand , if thermal motions of the ﬁlament tip or obstacle come from non - thermal sources , as in Refs . [ 43 – 45 ] , force ﬂuctuations could instead result from the geometrical constraints imposed on the individual ﬁlaments by the network structure . Then one might expect the bending - induced ﬂuctuation of a given ﬁlament tip position to be (cid:46) δ ; larger deformations would likely be evened out by the diﬀerences in growth velocity . As described in Appendix A , one can estimate the spring constant of a ﬁlament in the direction of motion as k bend (cid:39) 0 . 5 pNnm . Then ∆ F ∼ k bend δ (cid:46) 1 . 35 pN , and the overestimate in Eq . 31 is (cid:46) 0 . 6 pN , much smaller than for thermal force ﬂuctuations . • Provided that k off ( r ) ≤ k 0 off and D obst is large , no type of ﬁlament - obstacle interaction potential leads to polymerization faster than a hard wall ; for monotonically decaying force ﬁelds the force - velocity relation is very near that for a hard wall , which is described well by the BR prediction . These results follow from Eq . 14 and are conﬁrmed by the simulations . For intermediate values of D obst ∼ k 0 on δ 2 , we ﬁnd that softer potentials accelerate growth slightly ( see Figure B . 1 ) . But when D obst is very small , a soft potential can accelerate polymerization substantially . This was found in the simulations of [ 22 ] , where a soft obstacle accelerated polymerization by about 100 % using D obst = 0 . 0016 k 0 on δ 2 . To understand this physically , consider the case of zero external force . In the limit of a slowly varying potential , it is legitimate to ignore the randomness in polymerization and treat ﬁlament growth as occurring at a constant velocity . As described in Section 3 . 2 , obstacle drag can then be included via an eﬀective force F eff = k B Tv obst / D obst [ 9 ] . After a suﬃciently long time , the probability distribution P ( r ) will settle into a steady - state form P ( r ) = exp { − [ U ( r ) + F eff · r ] / k B T } / Z , where Z is the corresponding partition function . Then following the derivation of Eq . 16 , and taking f ( r ) = 1 in Eq . 15 so that ¯ k off = k 0 off , ¯ k on = ( k 0 on / Z ) exp ( − F eff δ / k B T ) (cid:90) ∞ −∞ exp [ − U ( r ) / k B T ] exp [ − F eff · r / k B T ] dr = exp ( − F eff δ / k B T ) k 0 on ( 32 ) Since v obst = ( ¯ k on − k 0 off ) δ , it follows that v obst = ( D obst x / δ − k 0 off δ ) , where x satisﬁes the transcendental Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 13 equation x / ˜ k on = exp ( − x ) exp ( ˜ k off ) and we deﬁne ˜ k on , off = ( k 0 on , off δ 2 / D obst ) . Therefore v obst = ( D obst / δ ) { W [ ˜ k on exp ( ˜ k off ) ] − ˜ k off } ( 33 ) (cid:39) ( D obst / δ ) ln ( ˜ k on / ˜ k off ) ( ˜ k on > > 1 , ˜ k off > > ln ( ˜ k on ) ) ( 34 ) (cid:39) ( D obst / δ ) [ ln ( ˜ k on ) − ln ( ln ˜ k on ) ] ( ˜ k on > > 1 , ˜ k off → 0 ) ( 35 ) where the Lambert function W is the inverse of the function x exp ( x ) . We have used the asymptotic expansion W ( x ) (cid:39) ln ( x ) − ln [ ln ( x ) ] , valid when x is large ( very slow diﬀusion ) . In cases of very slow obstacle diﬀusion , the simpliﬁed form Eq . 34 will hold if the ratio between the on - and oﬀ - rates is moderate . The physical content of this result is clariﬁed by considering the work done in moving the obstacle . The work done per added subunit is ( v obst k B T / D obst ) δ where the ﬁrst term is the force according to the Einstein relation . From Eq . 34 this equals k B T ln ( k 0 on / k 0 off ) , which is the free energy released per added subunit [ 38 ] . Thus the process is 100 % eﬃcient in that all of the free energy of polymerization is used to push the obstacle against the drag force . If ( k 0 on / k 0 off ) is large , the velocity in Eq . 34 could exceed the hard - wall limit 2 D obst / δ [ 9 ] substantially . For example , for a free - actin concentration of 10 µM , our parameters would predict that ( k 0 on / k 0 off ) (cid:39) 100 , and the logarithm is greater than 4 . Then the hard - wall limit would be exceeded by more than a factor of 2 . The simulations of Ref . [ 22 ] treated the case ˜ k on = 6 . 67 × 10 2 and ˜ k off = 0 . In this case , Eq . 33 gives v obst = 4 . 9 D obst / δ , while Eq . 35 gives v obst = 4 . 6 D obst / δ , both about a factor of two above the hard - wall limit and comparable with the value of 4 . 4 D obst / δ found in Ref . [ 22 ] . This suggests that the analytic theory captures the key eﬀects in these simulations . • For relatively shallow attractive potentials the velocity can be a substantial fraction of the free - ﬁlament velocity at zero force , but decay rapidly with opposing force . This ﬁnding may help explain the results of experiments [ 46 ] studying small number of actin ﬁlaments growing against a hard wall , if the ﬁlament tips are weakly bound to the wall . The ﬁlaments propelled acrosomes attached to beads held in an optical trap ( backwards ) . The ﬁlaments / acrosome / bead are moving rather than the obstacle , so as discussed above it is their motion that is considered . The growth velocity was found to drop oﬀ much more rapidly than expected from the BR model at forces of a few tenths of a pN per ﬁlament , especially at a 2 µM actin concentration . We cannot treat their many - ﬁlament system within our model , so we consider a single ﬁlament growing against an obstacle with a force of a few tenths of a pN . Because the bead is trapped in potential well of spring constant k c (cid:39) 0 . 008 pN / nm , the “free” contribution Z free is diﬀerent from that calculated in Sec . 3 . 2 . The energy of the bead in the potential well , displaced a distance r from the minimum , is k c r 2 / 2 . Thus Z free = (cid:82) ∞ 0 exp ( − F ext · r ) exp ( − k c r 2 / 2 ) dr . Provided that F ext ≥ √ k c k B T = 0 . 2 pN , the reduction in Z free from F ext will exceed that from k c , and it is reasonable to take Z free = k B T / F ext as in Sec . 3 . 2 . Then Eq . 25 applies , and a force of few tenths of a pN per ﬁlament could reduce the velocity by a large factor if Z well ≥ 15 nm . The validity of Eq . 25 requires that η = v 0 Z well / D obst < < 1 . In Ref . [ 46 ] , v 0 was less than 20 nm / s , so a diﬀusion coeﬃcient ≥ 600 nm 2 / s would be adequate . Experiments on whole cells [ 19 , 47 ] have shown that the growth velocity of lamellipodia drops very rapidly with opposing force . The velocity decay found here may contribute to this eﬀect , but only if the ﬁlaments are suﬃciently long to allow thermal ﬂuctuations greater than Z free = k B T / F ext away from the obstacle . In this system , mechanical factors may be the dominant eﬀect [ 19 ] . • Sustaining strong pulling forces at a signiﬁcant rate of polymerization requires a deep , broad well in the ﬁlament - obstacle interaction . Actin ﬁlaments polymerizing under pulling force may have several functions . They could act as parts of force sensors , or as mechanical absorbers for rapidly generated forces from myosin motors [ 2 ] . It is also believed that actin ﬁlaments in the central region of endocytic sites in budding yeast exert pulling forces on the membrane [ 4 , 6 ] , and it is important to know if ﬁlaments can polymerize suﬃciently quickly to generate a gel in the pulling region that can sustain the large stresses generated by the process . The behavior of actin ﬁlaments under pulling forces has been addressed by thermodynamic arguments [ 48 ] as well as kinetic models [ 2 , 49 ] and simulations [ 27 , 50 ] . Most of the calculations have predicted acceleration of polymerization by pulling force , but Ref . [ 50 ] found a competition between diﬀerent conformational factors that could either slow or speed polymerization . Experimental studies [ 2 , 49 , 51 , 52 ] have shown that polymerization under pulling forces of several pN is possible if actin ﬁlaments are linked to the obstacle via formins . They suggest , on the whole , that pulling force accelerates polymerization if rotational constraints are absent . These models have included eﬀects not explicitly included here , such as conformational changes of formins at the actin ﬁlament tip . Our ﬁnding that for narrow wells polymerization is incompatible with the ability to sustain large forces implies that in the Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 14 systems where this phenomenon occurs , the interaction between the actin ﬁlament and the obstacle must have a broad minimum . Our models are too simple to quantitatively describe the three - dimensional geometry of a formin - tipped actin ﬁlament , but the broad minimum in our “double - well” potential may approximately mimic the conformational ﬂexibility that appears to be at the heart of the phenomenon . The calculations described here make several major approximations , including the treatment of just a single ﬁlament , and the modeling of the ﬁlament - obstacle interaction via simple potential energy functions . To make direct contact with experiments will require more complex calculations for many - ﬁlament systems . The present results can help make progress toward this goal by informing multiscale calculations such as those of Ref . [ 10 , 12 – 19 , 28 – 32 , 53 , 54 ] , which treat force generation by multiﬁlament systems using a variety of approximations to include the single - ﬁlament force - velocity relation . The present results will provide useful guidance , especially in cases where diﬀerent types of ﬁlament - obstacle interactions are present in the same system .

Biopolymer Force - Velocity Relation 1 APPENDIX The eﬀect of the ﬁlament - obstacle interaction on the force - velocity relation of a growing biopolymer F . Motahari and A . E . Carlsson Here we extend the results beyond the simplifying approximations made in the body of the paper , by including ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations , oblique incidence , and slower diﬀusion . Appendix A : Filament - Tip Fluctuations and Oblique Incidence We treat oblique incidence together with ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations , since these ﬂuctuations are much greater at oblique incidence than at perpendicular incidence . We use an incidence angle of θ = 45 o as in Figure A . 1 . The ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations are modeled by a variable z tip describing the deﬂection of the tip , assumed to move according to Brownian dynamics in a quadratic potential well : ∆ z tip = α (cid:48) √ 24∆ t (cid:112) D tip + D tip k B T ∆ t [ − F ( r ) − k bend · z tip ] ( A1 ) Here D tip = 5 × 10 4 nm 2 sec = 10 D obst is the ﬁlament tip diﬀusion coeﬃcient . The true value of D tip is probably greater than this , since the part of the ﬁlament free to bend is much smaller than the 5 µm obstacle that we consider . However , using the actual value would render the simulations extremely demanding . For this reason we have chosen a value an order of magnitude larger than D obst , so that the tip ﬂuctuations will equilibrate on time scales much faster than that of obstacle motion . The variation of the deﬂection z tip is limited : the tip can not bend down past its own base or up so far that its height from the base exceeds the ﬁlament length . The time step ∆ t = 10 − 9 sec is is chosen so that ﬁlament tips will move much less than the subunit size in one time step . The tip bending stiﬀness k bend is obtained [ 55 ] as k bend = 3 k B TL p / L 3 sin 2 θ = 0 . 5 pNnm , where L p (cid:39) 20 µm [ 56 , 57 ] is the persistence length and L is the ﬁlament length , which we take to have a typical lamellipodium value of 100 nm . Finally α (cid:48) is a random number uniformly distributed between − 12 and 12 , so that < α (cid:48) 2 > = 112 . Consecutive time steps are uncorrelated . Figure A . 2 shows the resulting force - velocity relation for diﬀerent pusher and puller potentials described in Figure 2 . Notice that the stall force is larger in this case because δ in Eq . 9 is replaced by δ cos ( θ ) = δ / √ 2 . The BR relation remains an upper bound for the growth velocity , and the force - velocity relations for both the hard wall and soft walls are very similar to the BR relation . The 5 k B T well and spike potentials continue to have a zero - force velocity that is a substantial fraction of the free - ﬁlament velocity , with velocities decaying more rapidly than the BR prediction . In potentials with deep wells , the polymerization is slowed by roughly the same amount as in our baseline results ( Figure 5 ) . The tradeoﬀ between polymerization rate and maximum sustainable pulling force is also preserved . Figure A . 1 .

Simulations of 20 seconds showing the force - velocity relation for diﬀerent forms of ﬁlament - obstacle interaction potential for oblique ﬁlament orientation , including ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations . Error bars are smaller than the symbols , except where indicated . The dashed line is the prediction of the BR model at large diﬀusion constant values for obstacle . Data points for pullers are shown out to forces where they detach from the obstacle in less than 20 sec . Appendix B : Eﬀect of Slow Obstacle Diﬀusion We have repeated the force - velocity relations for the oblique ﬁlament case ( 45 ◦ orientation , including ﬁlament - tip ﬂuctuations ) with a smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient to see which ﬁndings in the main text depend strongly on the assumption of rapid diﬀusion . Figure B . 1 shows results for a diﬀusion coeﬃcient of D = 21 nm / s 2 . For this value of D , the dimensionless parameter characterizing diﬀusion δ 2 k on / 2 D obst has the value unity , so the eﬀects of diﬀusion should be substantial . The polymerization rate for the more rapidly growing potentials - including the “Hard Wall” , the “Soft Wall” , and the “Puller” with 5 k B T well depth , is slowed by about a factor of 2 . As in the main text , the completely repulsive continuous potentials have force - velocity relations similar to the hard wall . However , the sharp drop in velocity for the 5 k B T potentials is eliminated , as expected from the analysis of Sec . 3 . 2 showing that this eﬀect depends on rapid diﬀusion . The eﬀect on the other force - velocity relations for deeper wells is smaller . The general shape of the force - velocity is unchanged , and there is no eﬀect on the ordering of the curves . As Figure B . 1 indicates , the eﬀect of using a softer wall on the growth velocity is minimal even when diﬀusion is slow . For a still softer wall with decay coeﬃcient κ 1 = 0 . 2 nm − 1 ( data not shown ) , the acceleration is about 10 % . Figure B . 1 .
