Budding in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves a polarized deposition of new cell surface material that is associated with a highly asym - metric disposition of the actin cytoskeleton . Mutants defective in gene CDC24 , which are unable to bud or establish cell polarity , have been of great interest with regard to both the mechanisms of cellular morphogen - esis and the mechanisms that coordinate cell - cycle events . To gain further insights into these problems , we sought additional mutants with defects in budding . We report here that temperature - sensitive mutants defective in genes CDC42 and CDC43 , like cdc24 mu - tants , fail to bud but continue growth at restrictive temperature , and thus arrest as large unbudded cells . Nearly all of the arrested cells appear to begin nuclear cycles ( as judged by the occurrence of DNA replica - tion and the formation and elongation of mitotic spin - dies ) , and many go on to complete nuclear division , supporting the hypothesis that the events associated with budding and those of the nuclear cycle represent two independent pathways within the cell cycle . The arrested mutant cells display delocalized cell - surface deposition associated with a loss of asymmetry of the actin cytoskeleton . CDC42 maps distal to the rDNA on chromosome XII and CDC43 maps near lys5 on chromosome VII . A important class of questions about the cell division cycle concerns the dependency relationships or other coordinating mechanisms that ensure that cell - cycle events occur in an appropriate sequence . Such questions have been investigated in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using mutations and inhibitors that block specific cell - cycle events ( Hartwell et al . , 1974 ; Pringle , 1978 ; Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ; Moir and Botstein , 1982 ; Wood and Hartwell , 1982 ; Jacobs et al . , 1988 ; Hartwell and Weinert , 1989 ) . In this context , temperature - sensitive ( Ts - ) ~ mutants defective in gene CDC24 have been of great interest . The ob - servation that such mutants can continue DNA synthesis and nuclear division while bud emergence is blocked ( Hartwell et al . , 1973 , 1974 ) suggests that the nuclear cycle is not de - pendent on the cytoplasmic processes involved in budding . Conversely , experiments with a variety of other mutations and inhibitors suggest that bud emergence is not dependent on the nuclear cycle ( Hartwell et al . , 1974 ; Pringle and Hart - well , 1981 ) . Thus , it appears that many of the events of the yeast cell cycle are organized into two parallel and indepen - A . E . M .

Integration of these pathways appears to be achieved by their common dependence on a cell cycle - initi - ating event known as Start and by their common necessity for cytokinesis ( Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ) . A weakness of this model has been its pivotal dependence on the properties of the cdc24 mutants . In particular , it is possible that in these mutants , a control that normally links the nuclear cycle to budding has broken down ( Pringle , 1978 ; Hartwell and Weinert , 1989 ) . Thus , it is important to determine whether the nuclear cycle can also continue in other mutants with defects in bud emergence . CDC24 is also of great interest in the context of studies of cellular morphogenesis . Under restrictive conditions , Ts - cdc24 mutants continue to grow but display delocalized secretion and cell - surface deposition ( Sloat and Pringle , 1978 ; Field and Schekman , 1980 ; Sloat et al . , 1981 ; Roberts et al . , 1983 ) . cdc24 mutants are also defective in zygote for - mation ( Reid and Hartwell , 1977 ) and are unable to localize either actin or the CDC3 and CDCIO gene products to presumptive budding sites ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kim , H . B . , B . K . Haarer , and J . R . Pringle , unpublished results ) . Thus , the inability of cdc24 mutants to bud appears to be just the most conspicuous manifestation of a general inability to establish or maintain cell polarity . Several lines of evidence suggest that the CDC24 gene product may interact with Ca 2 . ( Ohya et al . , 1986a , b ; Miyamoto et ai . , 1987 ) , an in - triguing possibility given the evidence that gradients or cur - © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 90 / 07 / 131 / 12 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , July 1990 131 - 142 131 rents of calcium may be involved in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in other cell types ( Jaffe et al . , 1975 ; Kropf and Quatrano , 1987 ; Schmid and Harold , 1988 ) . Isolation of other cdc24 - 1ike mutants and character - ization of the corresponding genes and gene products should help to clarify further the nature of the cellular machinery involved in the establishment of cell polarity and the local - ization of growth and secretion in yeast . For these reasons , we undertook an intensive search for additional Ts - , cdc24 - 1ike mutants . We report here the iso - lation of several such mutants , defining genes CDC42 and CDC43 , and a characterization of the cdc42 and cdc43 mu - tant phenotypes . In the companion paper ( Johnson and Prin - gle , 1990 ) , we report a molecular characterization of CDC42 , which appears likely to encode a protein that binds and hy - drolyzes GTP while bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane . Materials and Methods Reagents Most reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources and were of the highest purity available . Ethyl methanesulfonate , 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) , Streptomyces griseus chitinase ( cat . No . C1525 ) , and FITC - labeled rabbit antiserum to rat IgG were obtained from Sigma Chemi - cal Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Giemsa stain was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . or Fisher Scientific Co . ( Liuonia , MI ) . Rhodamine phalloidin was ob - tained from Molecular Probes Inc . ( Eugene , OR ) , and 2 - 14Curacil was obtained from Amersham Corp . ( Arlington Heights , IL ) . Rat mAb to yeast tuhulin ( YOL1 / 34 ; Kilmartin et al . , 1982 ) was a gift from John Kilmartin ( Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , England ) , and Calcofluor White M2R New was a gift from American Cyanamid ( Bound Brook , NJ ) . Strains , Media , and Growth Conditions The primary wild - type and Ts - cell - division - cycle ( cdc ) mutant strains used are listed in Table I . Other strains derived from these are described where appropriate below . Solid media used were the rich medium YEPD and minimal medium containing appropriate supplements ( Sherman et al . , 1986 ) . Liquid cultures were grown in the rich , glucose - containing medium YM - P ( Lillie and Prin - gle , 1980 ) . Cultures used for physiological and morphological studies were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks with rotary shaking . Ts - mutants were grown at appropriate permissive and restrictive temperatures ( see below ) . Mutant Isolation and Genetic Methods Standard genetic methods ( Sherman et al . , 1986 ) were used for all crosses and complementation analyses in this study . Scoring of the segregation of Ts - mutations in crosses was found to be more reliable when very light in - ocula were used during replica plating . To this end , dilute suspensions of cells from the spore clones were made in the wells ofa microtiter dish , and droplets were then transferred to the appropriate replica plates using a 48 - prong wire inoculator . Mutants were isolated from strains C276 - 4A and C276 - 4B after muta - genesis with ethyl methanesulfonate ( Fink , 1970 ) to " - 1 % survival . To as - sure the independent origin of the mutants analyzed , aliquots of the mutage - nized culture were diluted with fresh medium to form numerous small subcultures immediately after mutagenesis , and no more than one mutant with a given phenotype was analyzed from each subculture . Ts - lethal mu - tants identified by replica plating at 23 - 24°C and 36 - 37°C were screened microscopically ( Hartwell et al . , 1973 ) to identify mutants of interest . In the early part of the mutant hunt , each Ts - clone was examined after tem - perature shift of an exponential - phase liquid culture from 23 to 36°C . Sub - sequently , however , the initial microscopic screening was done on cells scraped from the 36 - 37°C replica plate . Promising candidates were then reexamined after temperature shift of a liquid culture . To avoid problems of evolution of the mutant strains , deep frozen stocks ( Pringle , 1975 ) were prepared after minimal subculturing , as soon as promising mutants were identified . To evaluate dominance and segregation patterns , each mutant of interest was crossed to C276 - 4A or C276 - 4B and Ts - segregants were again crossed to C276 - 4A or C276 - 4B . Because of the ostensible isogenicity of C276 - 4A and C276 - 4B ( Wilkinson and Pringle , 1974 ) , these crosses can be regarded as backcrosses . After various numbers of such backcrosses , ap - propriate pairs of segregants were mated to produce the congenic , heterozy - gous and homozygous diploid strains used for detailed physiological and morphological analyses . Other Methods Procedures for fixing cells with formaldehyde , sonicating to disperse clumps , determining total cell numbers turbidometrically or with the Coulter counter ( model ZB ; Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) , examining cell morphologies and determining the proportions of unbudded ceils by phase - contrast microscopy , and measuring dry weights by filtration have been described previously ( Pringle and Mor , 1975 ; Pringle et al . , 1989 ) . The volumes of individual cells were calculated from phase - contrast micro - graphs as described previously ( Johnston et al . , 1977 ) . Time - lapse observa - tions were performed essentially as described by Hartwell et al . ( 1970 ) . Staining of nuclei with Giemsa or DAPI was performed as described ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Pringle et al . , 1989 ) , and incorporation of 2 - 14Curacil into DNA and RNA was determined as described by Wilkinson and Pringle ( 1974 ) , except that experiments were carried out in YM - P rather than minimal medium . Antitubulin immunofluorescence , staining of cell wall chitin with Calcofluor , and staining of actin with rhodamine phal - loidin were performed as described by Pringle et al . ( 1989 ) ; cell wall diges - tion before immunofluorescence used a mixture of glusulase and zymolyase at 37°C . Cell ghosts were prepared by sequential extractions as described by Cabib and Bowers ( 1971 ) ; these extractions remove cytoplasm and cell wall mannoproteins , leaving a glucan - chitin shell that is susceptible to chitinase digestion . Chitinase digestion used 0 . 25 mg / ml chitinase in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 3 , for 1 . 5 h at 37°C . The digested ghosts were collected by centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 5 min and washed once with water by centrifugation before staining with Calcofluor . Results Isolation and Genetic Analysis of Mutants Defective in Budding Of (cid:127)5 , 000 Ts - lethal mutants that were screened micro - scopically , 35 satisfied the two criteria ( a ) that they arrested predominantly as large , unbudded cells of normal ( i . e . , ellip - soidal ) or more nearly spherical shape at restrictive tempera - ture and ( b ) that they were sufficiently tightly arrested at re - strictive temperature and genetically tractable to be analyzed successfully . Of these , 23 carried cdc24 mutations and 1 car - ried a cdc41 mutation , as judged by complementation and linkage analyses , and were not studied further . Seven addi - tional mutants ( JPTI63 , JPT198 , JPTR37 , JPTRll4 , JPTR407 , JPTR415 , and JPTR592 ) are the subject of this report . ( The remaining mutants will be described elsewhere . ) When JPT163 was crossed to C276 - 4B , temperature sensi - tivity segregated 0 : 4 ( Ts ÷ not temperature sensitive : Ts - ) , 1 : 3 , and 2 : 2 in 2 , 15 , and 4 tetrads , respectively , and only a fraction of the Ts - segregants accumulated large , unbud - ded cells at 36°C . Thus , JPT163 contains two unlinked Ts - mutations . When appropriate segregants were backcrossed further to C276 - 4A and C276 - 4B , temperature sensitivity segregated consistently 2 : 2 through > 60 tetrads , and all Ts - segregants that were examined accumulated large , unbudded cells at 36°C , indicating that a single nuclear mutation was responsible for the phenotype of interest . As diploids hetero - zygous for this mutation grew essentially normally at 36°C ( see also below ) , the mutation is recessive .

When JPT198 , JPTR37 , JPTRll4 , JPTR415 , and JPTR - 592 were backcrossed to C276 - 4A and C276 - 4B , the hetero - zygous diploids grew essentially normally at 36°C ( see also below ) , and temperature sensitivity segregated consistently 2 : 2 in > - 15 total tetrads from at least three successive back - crosses in each case . All Ts - segregants that were examined accumulated large , unbudded cells at 36°C . Thus , each of these mutants harbors a single , recessive , nuclear mutation that is responsible for the phenotype of interest . In contrast , when JPTR407 was crossed to C276 - 4A , a mixture of 4 : 0 ( Ts * : Ts - ) , 3 : 1 , and 2 : 2 tetrads was obtained ; when a Ts - segregant was further backcrossed , this segregation pattern was repeated . Thus , at least two mutations are responsible for the Ts - phenotype of JPTR407 . All seven of the new mutants complemented well with cdc24 and other previously known Ts - mutants showing ac - cumulation of unbudded cells at restrictive temperature , and JPT163 - derived strains complemented well with JPT198 , JPTR37 , JPTRll4 , JPTR415 , JPTR592 , and JPTR407 ( Fig . 1 and data not shown ) . However , the last five mutants all failed to complement testers derived from JPT198 ( Fig . 1 and data not shown ; weak complementation was sometimes observed between JPTR407 and the JPT198 - derived strains ) . In addition , MATs strains derived from JPT198 failed to complement strain 104 , which is the original cdc3 mutant but also contains a second , unlinked Ts - mutation ( Hart - well et al . , 1973 ) . When the two mutations were separated by picking appropriate segregants from a cross of 104 to C276 - 4B , the cdc3 - 1 strains ( which accumulated multibud - ded , multinucleate cells at restrictive temperature ) com - plemented well with the JPT198 - derived strains ( Fig . 1 ) , whereas the other Ts - segregants ( which produced morpho - logically heterogeneous populations at restrictive tempera - ture ) failed to complement the JPT198 - derived strains . Thus , Adams et al . Cell Polarity and Budding in Yeast 133 Figure 1 . Complementation tests on the new and previously iden - tiffed mutants . The testers are in - dicated by allele designations ( see Table I for strain names ) ; they rep - resent previously known mutants that arrest as large unbudded cells ( Hartwell et al . , 1973 ; Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ) plus the cdc3 - 1 allele present in strain 104 ( Hart - well et al . , 1973 ; see text ) . The other strains define the new genes CDC42 ( JPTI63 derivatives ) and CDC43 ( JPT198 , JPTR37 , JPTR - 114 , JPTR415 , and JPTR592 ) . the complementation data suggested that the JPT163 - derived strains carry an allele ( cdc42 - 1 ) of a new gene , designated CDC42 , whereas 104 , JPT198 , JPTR37 , JPTRI14 , JPTR - 415 , and JPTR592 carry alleles ( cdc43 - 1 through cdc43 - 6 , respectively ) of another new gene , designated CDC43 . Al - though it has not been investigated further , the failure of the cdc434 strains to share the morphological phenotype of the other cdc43 mutants seems likely to reflect either the leaki - ness of the Ts - mutation or the presence of background mu - tations that arose during the very heavy mutagenesis used ( Hartwell , 1967 ) when strain 104 was isolated . Although it has also not been investigated further , JPTR407 presumably carries a weakly Ts - allele of CDC43 ( designated cdc43 - 7 ) together with an additional mutation ( s ) that enhances its tem - perature sensitivity . The interpretation of the complementation data was sup - ported by the results of linkage analyses . Dissection of 42 tetrads from a cross between strains JPT163BD2 - 10A ( cdc42 - 1 ) and JPT198BD2 - 2B ( cdc43 - 2 ) yielded 119 viable spores ( at 23°C ) , of which 44 were Ts ÷ , showing that the two Ts - mu - tations are unlinked . Interestingly , complementation analy - ses showed that the remaining viable spores contained either the cdc42 - 1 mutation or the cdc43 - 2 mutation but not both , implying that the double mutant spores were inviable at 23°C ( see Discussion ) . When Ts - strains derived from 104BD1 - 4C , JPTRll4 , JPTR415 , or JPTR592 were crossed with JPT198 - derived strains , no Ts ÷ segregants were obtained ( t > 13 tetrads and I > 35 viable spores per cross ) . In contrast , a cross between strains carrying the Ts - mutations from JPT198 and JPTR37 yielded at least 5 apparently Ts ÷ segre - gants ( plus several others that were Ts ÷ ~ - ) among 88 viable spores from 22 tetrads . Although the reason for this high fre - quency of apparent recombination or reversion involving the cdc43 - 2 and cdc43 - 3 mutations is not known ( see Discus - sion ) , the allelism of these mutations seems solidly estab - lished by ( a ) their essentially identical phenotypes , ( b ) their noncomplementation , and ( c ) the fact that each mutation showed tight linkage to lys5 ( next paragraph ) in crosses in which each Ts - mutation showed a clear 2 : 2 segregation . The novelty of genes CDC42 and CDC43 was further es - tablished by determining their map positions . CDC42 is on the right ann of chromosome XH , distal to the rDNA ( John - son et al . , 1987 ) . CDC43 maps near LYS5 on the left arm of chromosome VH . In a cross between a cdc43 - 3 strain and XS144 - S19 , 16 of 16 tetrads were parental ditype for cdc43 and lys5 . When a cdc43 - 2 strain was crossed to XS144 - S19 and STX88AD , 5 of 634 viable spores ( from 225 tetrads ) were recombinant for cdc43 and lysS ; of these , only one was recombinant between lys5 and the centromere - proximal marker aro2 . Thus , the gene order appears to be CEN7 - ARO2 - LYS5 - CDC43 , with CDC43 ~ 1 cM from LYSS . Most other known genes whose mutants have phenotypes even roughly similar to those of cdc42 and cdc43 have previously been mapped to other locations ( Hartwell et al . , 1973 ; Mor - timer et al . , 1989 ) . For the unmapped genes , the comple - mentation analyses cited above were supplemented by tetrad analyses where desirable and practicable . Numerous Ts + re - combinants were observed when cdc33 or cdc41 strains were crossed to cdc42 or cdc43 strains , supporting the distinctness of these genes . Attempts to do tetrad analysis with cdc22 or cdc32 strains were precluded by the same problems noted pre - viously ( Hartwell et al . , 1973 ; Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ) , and the distinctness of the cdcl phenotype ( Hartwell et al . , 1973 , 1974 ) seemed sufficient to obviate further analyses .

Cultures growing ex - ponentially at 20°C were split into two portions , one of which re - ceived 0 . 9 # Ci / ml of 2 - 14Curacil . After 12 - h further incubation at 20°C , each labeled and unlabeled culture ( at 1 - 2 × 106 cells / ml ) was split into two portions , one of which was incubated further at 20°C ( open symbols ) while the other was shifted to 36°C ( solid symbols ) . Samples removed from the unlabeled cultures were used to determine cell numbers with the Coulter counter ( squares , A - C ) and the proportions of unbudded cells ( G - l ) , whereas sam - pies from the labeled cultures were used to determine incorporation into DNA and RNA ( squares and circles respectively , D - F ) . Dry weight data for strains JPT163 - HO2 and C276 ( circles , A and B ) were collected in a separate experiment involving a shift from 22 to 36°C ; data for cell numbers and percents unbudded cells in this experiment were very similar to those shown here , except that growth was somewhat faster at 22°C than at 20°C , as expected . Growth Characteristics of cdc42 and cdc43 Strains Detailed characterization of the mutant phenotypes was con - ducted using homozygous and heterozygous diploids con - structed after backcrossing several times to C276 - 4A and C276 - 4B ( see Materials and Methods ) . We first examined the mutants after shifting cultures from 23 - 24°C to 36 - 37°C ( the temperatures used in the original mutant isolations ) . Under these conditions , both JPTI63 - HO2 and JPT198 - HO3 increased , , ol . 9 - fold in cell number before arresting as un - budded cells . Thus , both strains exhibited " first - cycle arrest " ( Hartwell , 1974 ) with apparent " execution points " ( Hartwell et al . , 1970 , 1973 ) between 0 . 05 and 0 . 1 of the cell . . cycle . This interpretation was consistent with the results of time - lapse observations ( data not shown ) , which suggested execu - tion points partway through the unbudded phase ( but also indicated some leakiness of the mutants , from the presence of cells that apparently divided and budded again at 36 - 37 °C ) . However , closer examination of the cultures revealed that this interpretation was misleading , especially for cdc43 , be - cause 23 - 24°C was in fact only semipermissive for the mu - tants . For several cdc43 - 2 strains , the generation time at 24°C was significantly longer than that of wild - type or het - erozygous mutant strains , and microscopic examination re - vealed that up to 30 % of the cells were distinctly abnormal morphologically . Presumably , these abnormalities reflected an abnormally low activity of the CDC43 gene product dur - ing growth of the mutant at 23 - 24°C . Abnormal cells were also apparent in cultures of cdc42 - 1 strains grown at 24°C , although the generation time was not significantly different from that of control strains . Reducing the permissive tem - perature to 18 - 20°C allowed cdc43 - 2 strains to grow with a generation time not grossly different from that of wild type at this temperature , and reduced the proportion of morpho - logically abnormal cells to 2 - 10 % ( for various strains on various occasions ) . Shift of mutant cultures from 18 - 20°C to 36°C did not produce results substantially different from those of a 24 - to - 360C shift for the cdc42 strains , but the cdc43 - 2 strains now underwent an approximate fourfold in - crease in cell number beforearresting ( see below ) . Strains carrying other cdc43 alleles also underwent an increase in cell number of fourfold or more upon shift from permissive ( 20 - 24°C ) to restrictive temperatures . These results illus - trate the difficulty of extracting useful information from exe - cution point data ( see Discussion ) . When cultures of cdc42 - 1 and cdc43 - 2 strains were shifted from 20 to 36°C , they underwent ~ , l . 9 - fold and about four - fold increases in cell number , respectively , before arresting uniformly as unbudded cells ( Fig . 2 , A and C ; Fig . 3 , A , C , G , and I ) . The slow increases in the apparent cell numbers at the later times in these experiments may reflect some leak - iness of the mutants ( see above ) , inadvertent counting ( with the Coulter counter ) of particles released by cell lysis ( which was apparent by microscopic examination in the cultures that had been 5 - 7 h at 360C ) , or both . Cells heterozygous for the cdc42 or cdc43 mutations grew essentially as well as wild type at 36°C in such experiments ( data not shown ) , confirm - ing the recessiveness of the mutations . As growth ( measured as cell volume , dry weight , or total RNA ) of the mutant cells continued for some time after cell proliferation had ceased ( Fig . 2 , A and C ; Fig . 3 , A , D , and F ) , the cells became ab - normally large . In the experiment of Fig . 3 , the volumes of individual unbudded cells were determined during growth at 200C and after 7 h at 360C ( n = 85 - 100 for each sample ) . The mean volume per cell increased , , ol2 - fold for cdc42 and about fivefold for cdc43 . Similarly , the mean dry weight per cell increased about fourfold for cdc42 ( Fig . 3 A ) and about threefold for cdc43 ( in a 24 - to - 360C shift experiment ; data not shown ) , fit should be noted that these data on mean dry weight per cell underestimate the increases undergone by in - dividual arrested cells , for several reasons . First , the starting population includes budded as well as unbudded cells . Sec - ond , the cell lysis , noted above , presumably causes a loss of measurable dry weight in the samples from the later time points . Third , for cdc43 particularly , the use of a semiper - missive temperature in these experiments meant that the cells were already larger than normal at the time of the shift to 36°C . ) In similar experiments , cdc43 - 3 strains yielded data very similar to those shown here for cdc43 - 2 .

After 7 - 8 h at 360C , cells were fixed and their nuclei stained with Giemsa ( see Materials and Methods ) , and counts were made of the number of nuclei per cell . Because it was not always possible to distin - guish a budded cell from a pair of adjacent unbodded cells , counts were done on the basis of " cell bodies ' ; thus , for example , a budded cell with a nucleus in the mother and another in the bud would have been counted as two cell bodies ; . each with one nucleus . Cell bodies containing no detectable nuclei ( e . g . , immature buds , or unstained or lysed cells ) were excluded from the counts . * Strains not described in Table I were constructed by backcrossing the appropriate original haploid mutant ( HartweU et al . , 1973 ; Sloat et al . , 1981 ; or this study ) the indicated number of times into the C276 - 4A / C276 - 4B background , then constructing homozygous diploids by mating appropriate pairs of segregants . ~ t 501 I - D3 is a diploid derived from mutant 5011 ( Hartwell et al . , 1973 ) without backcrossing into the C276 - 4AIC276 - 4B background ( Sloat et al . , 1981 ) . Continuation of the Nuclear Cycle in cdc24 , cdc42 , and cdc43 Mutants We used several assays to examine the extent to which the nuclear cycle could continue in mutants that were blocked in bud emergence . One assay was to stain the arrested cells with DAPI or Giemsa and determine the proportions that contained two or more nuclei ( or , at least , two or more sepa - rated sets of chromosomes : note that these DNA stains do not necessarily reveal the status of the nuclear envelope Pringle et al . , 1989 ) . As reported previously ( Hartwell et ai . , 1973 , 1974 ) , the cdc24 - 1 strain 5011 - D3 arrested with most cells containing two or more nuclei ( Table II ) . Surpris - ingly , however , the cdc24 - 3 strain E187 - JD1 and the cdc24 - 4 strains JPTI9 - HO1 and JPT19 - HO2 were much less success - ful in continuing nuclear division in the arrested cells ( Table II ) . To determine whether these differences were due to the cdc24 alleles themselves or to the genetic backgrounds of the strains ( the different cdc24 mutants were all of different origins and were isolated after heavy mutagenesis ) , we backcrossed all three cdc24 alleles extensively into the C276 - 4A / C276 - 4B genetic background and tested several of the resulting dip - loids for each allele . As the representative data in Table II show , these strains were rather similar in their behavior , but none was as successful in completing multiple nuclear cycles as 5011 - D3 . Similarly , strains harboring cdc42 or cdc43 mu - tations also arrested development with significant numbers of binucleate and ( in some cases ) multinucleate cells , but none was as successful in completing nuclear cycles as 5011 - D3 ( see representative data in Table II ) . Thus , the results sug - gested that the high proportion of binucleate and multinucle - ate cells achieved by 5011 - D3 was a special property of this strain , and left some uncertainty as to the normal dependence or independence of the nuclear cycle upon bud emergence . To shed more light on this issue , we asked if cells that failed to complete nuclear division could at least begin the nuclear cycle , as judged by their ability to replicate DNA and to form mitotic spindles . ( Previous analyse ~ have indicated that DNA replication and spindle formation are themselves independent events Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 . ) During Table III .

( A - F ) Fluorescence micrographs of cell " ghosts " of strain C276 ( A and B ) or JPT163 - HO2 ( C - F ) stained with Calco - fluor before or after chitinase treatment . Cells growing exponentially at 23 ( A and B ) or 19°C ( C and D ) or cells that had been shifted from 19 to 36°C for 6 h ( E and F ) were fixed with formaldehyde and extracted to prepare cell ghosts ( see Materials and Methods ) . The ghosts were then either stained directly with Calcofluor ( A , C , and E ) or treated with chitinase ( see Materials and Methods ) and then stained with Calco - fluor ( B , D , and F ) . Calcofluor staining used 0 . 005 % Calcofluor in water for 3 min at 23°C followed by two washes with water . A - F were all photographed and printed using identical magnifications and exposure times . Although not visible in B , D , and F , , the gen - eral outlines of the ghosts were not detect - ably affected by the chitinase treatments . ( G ) Fluorescence micrograph of JPT163 - HO2 cells during renewed budding after " shift - down " from restrictive to permissive temperature . Cells growing exponentially at 23°C were shifted to 360C for 4 h , then returned to 23°C for 6 h , then fixed with formaldehyde and stained with 0 . 1 % Calco - fluor for 10 min followed by two washes with water . Bars , 4 # m . the 6 - 7 h after a shift of cdc42 strains from 20 to 36°C , the amount of DNA increased ~ 3 . 5 - fold while the cell number increased only " ol . 9 - fold ( Fig . 3 , A and D ) . Given that , o50 % of the cells in the population at 20°C would already have been in G2 , these data suggest that most cells in the ar - rested population had replicated their DNA even when . nu - clear division was unsuccessful . Similarly , the amount of DNA in arresting cdc43 populations increased , o5 . 5 - fold while the cell number increased only , o4 - fold ( Fig . 3 , C and F ) , again suggesting that most cells in the arrested popula - tions had replicated their DNA . However , it must be noted that interpretation of these experiments was complicated by several factors , including ( a ) the leakiness of the mutants , ( b ) the unknown contribution of mitochondrial DNA synthesis to the total , ( c ) the appreciable amount of cell lysis at later times , and ( d ) the possibility that the binucleate cells might have replicated their DNA again while some of the uninucle - ate cells remained in G1 . The analysis of spindle formation appeared to be more straightforward . Immunofluorescence with antitubulin anti - bodies showed clearly that most arrested cdc42 cells had progressed into the nuclear cycle at least to the extent of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 138 forming complete spindles ( Fig . 2 , E and F ; Table III ) . Moreover , most of these spindles went on to elongate ( Table III ) ; as spindle elongation appears to be dependent on prior DNA replication ( Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ) , this observa - tion provided further evidence that DNA replication had oc - curred in these cells . Thus , taking the various results together , we conclude that when bud emergence is arrested , nearly all cells can begin the nuclear cycle , even though not all may be able to com - plete it ( see Discussion ) . Abnormal Morphogenesis in the cdc42 and cdc43 Mutants The fact that the cdc42 and cdc43 mutants continued to grow , but failed to bud , suggested that they wight be defective in establishing the polarization of secretion and cell - surface deposition that is necessary for budding ( see Introduction ) . Further evidence in support of this hypothesis was provided by the shape of the arrested cells , which were nearly spheri - cal ( Fig . 2 , A and C ) , suggesting that they had grown by an isotropic incorporation of new cell - surface material . Indeed , when the arrested cells were stained with Calcofluor , they appeared uniformly bright ( Fig . 2 , B and D ; the cdc43 cells were more variable in this regard than were the cdc42 cells ) . As Calcofluor appears to stain chitin specifically within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ) , the results suggested that chitin had been incorporated into the cell wall in a delocalized manner , rather than specifically at the budding sites ( compare the Calcofluor - staining patterns of the cells grown at permissive temperature in Fig . 2 , B and D ) . This interpretation was supported by the finding that chitinase treatment could remove the Calcofluor - positive ma - teriai from " ghosts " of normal or arrested cdc42 cells without detectably altering the overall outlines of the ghosts ( Fig . 4 , A - F ) . Moreover , the brightly stained cells were not simply cells whose staining properties had changed because they were dead : return of such ceils to permissive temperature al - lowed the formation of new buds , whose walls were Calco - fluor dark like those of normal cells ( Fig . 4 G ) . As the cellular actin network appears to be directly in - volved in the polarization of secretion and cell - surface depo - sition in yeast ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ; Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Drubin et al . , 1988 ) , we anticipated that this network might lose its normal asymmetric distribution in cdc42 and cdc43 cells at restric - tive temperature . Staining with rhodamine phalloidin showed that this was indeed the case for the vast majority of arrested cdc42 cells ( Fig . 5 ) . ( cdc43 was not examined because of the partial abnormality of the cells at permissive temperature and their slow arrest at restrictive temperature . ) Certain nonlethal mutations in CDC24 ( Sloat et al . , 1981 ) and several other genes ( Bender and Pringle , 1989 ; Chant , J . , and I . Herskowitz , personal communication ) can affect the pattern of bud - site selection , suggesting that the products of these genes are involved in the initial decision as to where the bud will form . Examination of the bud - scar patterns of strains carrying the available cdc42 and cdc43 alleles , after growth at permissive temperatures , did not reveal any obvi - ous abnormalities ( see Discussion ) . Discussion Isolation and Analysis of Mutants Defective in Budding Mutants defective in gene CDC24 , which continue growth but are unable to bud or establish cell polarity , have been of great interest with regard both to the mechanisms of cellular morphogenesis and to the mechanisms that coordinate cell - cycle events . To gain further insight into these problems , we sought additional mutants with defects in budding . To this end , a collection of ' ~ 5 , 000 Ts - lethal mutants was screened microscopically to identify mutants that arrested uniformly as large , unbudded cells of normal or rounder - than - normal shape at restrictive temperature . We have reported here the characterization of seven such mutants , which define the genes CDC42 and CDC43 . The genetic and phenotypic anal - yses presented several features of interest . Figure 5 . Cells of strain JPT163 - HO1 ( see Table II ) growing exponentially at 23°C were shifted to 36°C for 2 h , then fixed and stained with rhodamine phalloi - din as described in Materials and Methods . Bar , 4 / tm . Adams et al . Cell Polarity and Budding in Yeast 139 First , the distribution of mutations among genes was far from random : 23 additional mutations in CDC24 were iso - lated in comparison to six in CDC43 and just one in CDC42 . These results provide further illustration ( see also Hartwell et al . , 1973 ; Pringle , 1981 ; Kaback et al . , 1984 ; Pringle , 1987 ) of the markedly different susceptibilities of different genes to Ts - mutations ( at least during in vivo mutant hunts ) , and thus emphasize the impracticality of relying solely on Ts - mutations if all genes involved in particular cellular processes are to be identified . As expected , genetic strategies not relying on Ts - mutations have begun to iden - tify numerous additional genes whose products appear to be involved in bud emergence ( Bender and Pringle , 1989 ; Cor - rado , K . , A . Farewell , and J . R . Pringle , unpublished re - sults ; Chant , J . , and I . Herskowitz , personal communica - tion ) . A possibly related point is that all of the cdc43 mutants obtained arrested only gradually after shift from an ap - propriately permissive ( see below ) to restrictive tempera - ture . It is possible that this behavior reflects an intrinsic as - pect of CDC43 function ( for example , the CDC43 product could be involved in the synthesis of some component that is itself normally present in excess ) . However , it seems as likely that we simply failed to identify any cdc43 alleles in which the gene product was sufficiently thermolabile ( at least at 36 - 37°C ) to give a more rapid arrest . Second , the results illustrate a variety of other important but often neglected points about the handling of Ts - cell - cy - cle mutants . For example , the markedly different success of different cdc24 - 1 strains in completing the nuclear cycle ( Ta - ble II ) illustrates the potentially profound effect of " genetic background " on mutant phenotype , especially when heavy mutagenesis has been used , and thus emphasizes the impor - tance of backcrossing to achieve isogenicity if conclusions about the effects of particular mutations are to be dr ~ iwn . Moreover , achieving the desired isogenicity may not be triv - ial , as illustrated here by the rather different behavior of the twice - backcrossed strains JPT163 - HO1 and JPT163 - HO2 ( Table II ; the differences between the five times - backcrossed 5011 - JHO1 and 5011 - JHO3 are probably also significant ) . However , it should also be noted that the results obtained with " messier " strains may sometimes actually be more in - formative : for example , the success of strain 5011 - D3 in completing nuclear division seems in fact to be the best guide to the actual relationship between bud emergence and the nuclear cycle ( see further discussion below ) . ( Similarly , it seems that the nonlethality of clathrin - deletion mutations in genetic backgrounds that may involve suppressors is as in - formative as is their lethality in other genetic backgrounds Payne et al . , 1987 ; Lemmon and Jones , 1987 . ) Finally , the behavior of the cdc43 mutants illustrates dramatically that the " permissive temperature " at which a Ts - mutant was isolated may not in fact be fully permissive . A corollary of this conclusion is that the observation of " first - cycle arrest " ( Hartwell , 1974 ) , the correlated determination of an " execu - tion point " ( Hartwell et al . , 1970 , 1973 ) , and ( especially ) in - ferences from such an execution point about the time of gene product function may be quite misleading ( Pringle , 1978 ; Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ; Richmond and Williamson , 1983 ) . Third , the inviability of cdc42 cdc43 double mutants at 23°C is one of a rapidly proliferating number of examples ( see also Hinnebusch and Fink , 1983 ; Salminen and Novick , 1987 ; WaUis et al . , 1989 ) indicating that such " synthetic lethality " ( Dobzhansky , 1946 ; Sturtevant , 1956 ) may consti - tute a highly specific test for genetic interaction and perhaps a basis for novel genetic screens . In the present case , it should also be noted that overexpression of CDC42 can sup - press certain Ts - cdc24 mutations ( Bender and Pringle , 1989 ) . Thus , it is likely that CDC24 , CDC42 , and CDC43 or their products all interact in some common pathway , as indeed already suggested by their very similar mutant pheno - types . Finally , the large number of Ts + ( or Ts + / - ) segregants ob - served in crosses between strains carrying the cdc43 - 2 and cdc43 - 3 alleles was surprising , especially as each allele dis - played a simple 2 : 2 segregation in other crosses . Similar results have been obtained in crosses involving certain pairs of cdc24 alleles ( McAllister , M . , R . A . Preston , and J . R . Pringle , unpublished results ) and certain pairs of cdc28 al - leles ( Dutcher , 1980 ) . Such results may reflect the presence of recombinational hotspots ( Coleman et al . , 1986 ; Syming - ton and Petes , 1988 ) , perhaps involving allele - specific effects on gene conversion frequencies ( Borts and Haber , 1987 ; Ponticelli et al . , 1988 ; Schuchert and Kohli , 1988 ) . However , in the case of cdc24 , most of the apparently Ts ÷ segregants that were analyzed appeared to harbor suppres - sors rather than being bona fide wild - type recombinants . It is not clear what sort of mechanism would generate suppres - sors at high frequencies in particular crosses . The Functional Organization of CeU - cycle Events The discovery that cdc24 mutants could continue DNA repli - cation and nuclear division while bud emergence was blocked ( Hartwell et al . , 1974 ) provided an antidote to ex - treme " domino theories " ( Mitchison , 1971 ; Murray and Kirschner , 1989 ) in which the events of the cell cycle were viewed as comprising a single dependent sequence . Instead , confirming Mitchison ' s ( 1971 ) prediction , these events ap - peared to be organized as a set of dependent pathways that were independent of each other but were integrated by cer - tain key regulatory events . Although this general view has received support from other sources and is now widely ac - cepted ( Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ; Murray and Kirschner , 1989 ; Hartwell and Weinert , 1989 ) , its original experimen - tal justification had always been weakened by the possibility that cdc24 mutations might eliminate a control mechanism that would normally make the nuclear cycle dependent on bud emergence ( Pringle , 1978 ; Hartwell and Weinert , 1989 ) . Thus , it was important to ask whether the nuclear cycle could also continue in other mutants in which bud emer - gence was blocked . The results of monitoring DNA replication , spindle for - marion and elongation , and nuclear division in cdc42 and cdc43 mutants suggest that nearly all arrested cells begin and progress into the nuclear cycle , even though not all are able to complete it and only a few manage to complete a second cycle . Moreover , studies of various cdc24 mutant strains in - dicate that the ability of strain 5011 - D3 to complete multiple nuclear cycles ( Table II ; Hartwell et al . , 1974 ) is a special property of this strain ( presumably dependent on unidenti - fied elements in its genetic background ) and does not reflect a general disruption of a normal control by cdc24 mutations . Although we do not know why the various arrested mutants The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume I 1 I , 1990 140 do not uniformly complete multiple nuclear cycles , we sus - pect that interactions between the nucleus and the budding site ( as normally mediated by the cytoplasmic microtubules Huffaker et al . , 1988 ; Jacobs et al . , 1988 ) may be neces - sary for efficient nuclear division . Despite this remaining puzzle , the observation that mutations in three different genes , which encode very different kinds of proteins ( Miya - moto et al . , 1987 ; Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ; Johnson et ai . , 1990 ) , can all block bud emergence without blocking the nu - clear cycle considerably strengthens an important conclu - sion about the functional organization of cell - cycle events . The Generation of Cell Polarity in Yeast The abnormal morphogenesis of cdc42 and cdc43 mutants has not yet been characterized as fully as that of cdc24 mu - tants . However , from the available evidence it appears that the inability of cdc42 and cdc43 mutants to bud , like that of cdc24 mutants , reflects a general inability to establish nor - mal spatial organization and cell polarity in cells in which macromolecule synthesis continues unabated . This interpre - tation is supported by the lack of asymmetry of the actin net - work , the delocalized chitin deposition , and the essentially spherical shape ( presumably reflecting an isotropic incorpo - ration of glucan , the shape - determining component of the cell wall Cabib and Bowers , 1971 ; Zlotnik et al . , 1984 ) seen in the arrested cells . It was interesting that the loss of polarity at restrictive temperature was not irreversible : cells that had been at 36°C for 4 h were able to resume budding ( and make seemingly normal buds ) upon return to 23°C . Al - though examination of the bud - scar patterns of mutant cells grown at permissive temperature revealed no abnormalities , studies of CDC42 overexpression suggest that this gene , like CDC24 , is also involved in the initial selection of the budding site ( Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) . Thus , it can be anticipated that further studies of CDC24 , CDC42 , CDC43 , and other genes that interact with them will provide important insights into the mechanisms of mor - phogenesis in yeast , and thus , by extension , in other eukary - otic cells . Already , the predicted sequences of the CDC24 , CDC42 , and CDC43 products have provided provocative clues to the nature of these mechanisms : the CDC24 product appears to interact with Ca ~ ÷ ( Miyamoto et al . , 1987 ) ; the CDC42 product probably binds and hydrolyzes GTP while bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane ( Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) ; and the CDC43 product may be a nu - clear protein ( Johnson et al . , 1990 ) . It seems likely that the generation of antibodies specific for these gene products and use of these antibodies in immunolocalization experiments will provide further insights .
