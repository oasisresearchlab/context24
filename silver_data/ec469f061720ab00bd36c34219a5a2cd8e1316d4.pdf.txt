Rosenblatt 1 Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase , epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body . However , epithelial cell division must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation . How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers ? When epithelial cells become too crowded , they activate the stretch - activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that later die 1 . However , it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state . Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched . By experimentally stretching epithelia , we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel . To stimulate cell division , stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium - dependent phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 , thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis . Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state , the type of mechanical force controls the outcome : stretch induces cell division , whereas crowding induces extrusion . How Piezo1 - dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is activated , as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell density . In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide , Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm , whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude , it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates . Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch , it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers , triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions . To investigate how epithelial cell division is controlled at steady state , we seeded Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells and measured the percentage of mitotic cells daily by immunostain - ing cells for phospho - histone H3 ( H3P ) ( Extended Data Fig . 1a , b ) . Although epithelial cells never stop dividing , the rates of cell division reach a slow steady state by around day 5 , at an average density of 11 cells per 1 , 000 μ m 2 , 3 days after reaching confluence ( Extended Data Fig . 1a , asterisk ) . The approximately 7 % mitotic rate at seeding slows to 0 . 7 % at steady state , when most cells are in the G0 / G1 stage of the cell cycle ( Extended Data Fig . 1a – c and Supplementary Videos 1 , 2 ) . How epithelial cells regulate cell division once they reach an optimal density is unclear . Although the overall cell division rates decrease as the monolayer reaches steady state , videos reveal that cells divide in sparse sub - regions of the epithelium ( Supplementary Video 2 ) . Furthermore , cell division occurs in zones that are consistently around 1 . 6 - fold less dense than zones in which no division occurs , as quantified by cell lengths in dividing versus non - dividing regions in human colon crypts ( 1 . 6 - fold ) , zebrafish epidermis ( 1 . 5 - fold ) , and MDCK monolayers ( 1 . 7 - fold ) ( Supplementary Videos 2 , 3 and Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . These observations led us to wonder whether cell stretch due to low cell density could activate epithelial cell division . To test this hypoth - esis , we experimentally stretched MDCK cells at the steady state by either wounding or directly stretching cells in plates designed for uniaxial tension , and analysed mitotic rates at different times after stretch . Stretching cells 1 . 4 - fold using a previously published device 1 or a newly designed stretch device ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) was suffi - cient to induce an approximately 5 - fold increase in cell division within only 1 h ( Extended Data Fig . 3b and Fig . 1a ) . Although the increased proliferation rate was low ( 1 . 3 % ) , it returned cells to homeostatic densities , as measured by averaged cell lengths , within 4 h ( Fig . 1b ) . Furthermore , scratching an MDCK monolayer caused cells to stretch 2 . 5 - fold times their original length once cell migration ceased and triggered a wave of cell division ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Video 4 , n = 6 ) , similar to that seen previously 2 . Cell division typically occurred within 1 – 2 h of wound closure , similar to the kinetics occurring after stretch . To determine what regulates stretch - induced mitosis , we inhibited a variety of candidate proteins implicated in cellular stress or stretch responses . Gadolinium , a generic stretch - activated channel inhibitor , consistently blocked stretch - induced proliferation , compared to a generic inhibitor of mitosis , the CDK1 inhibitor roscovitine ( Fig . 2a ) . Because Piezo1 is a stretch - activated channel required for crowding - induced , extrusion - dependent epithelial cell death 1 , 3 , we tested whether it might also control stretch - dependent proliferation . Knockdown of Piezo1 by short interfering RNA ( siRNA ; or a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) Piezo1 construct , not shown ) reduced Piezo1 to 7 % of wild - type levels and prevented stretch - induced mitosis ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Notably , long - term knockdown of Piezo1 also reduced steady - state rates of proliferation ( Fig . 2a , unstretched ) . Transfection of a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged Piezo1 construct not targeted by the siRNA rescued stretch - induced proliferation , indicating that pro - liferation after stretch requires Piezo1 ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Piezo1 knockdown also blocked cell division after wound closure , in comparison to con - trol monolayers ( Fig . 2c ) . To test whether Piezo1 controlled epithelial cell division in vivo , we examined its role in zebrafish epidermis , a model for the simple epithelia that coat our organs . We assayed for H3P - positive cells in epidermis from 4 - day - old zebrafish larvae , a stage at which cell division reaches a steady - state rate ( Extended Data Fig . 4a and ref . 1 ) . Using a CRISPR - based technique to knockdown Piezo1 mosaically in the F 0 generation 4 , 5 , we found that reducing Piezo1 levels to approximately 50 % decreased the number of H3P - positive epidermal cells by 5 - fold ( Fig . 2d – f ) . Furthermore , a photo - activated morpholino targeting Piezo1 also reduced epidermal cell proliferation by around 5 - fold ( Extended Data Fig . 4b – d ) . Together , our data show that epithelial cells at the steady state become stretched before they divide , that stretch is sufficient to activate cell division rapidly , and that cell division either at the steady state or after experimental stretch requires the stretch - activated channel Piezo1 . We next tested where in the cell cycle stretch activates Piezo1 to induce mitosis . Because the mitotic response to stretch is so rapid , it seemed unlikely that stretch - activation of Piezo1 triggers cells to transit through an entire cell cycle from the G0 phase ( ~ 12 – 24 h ) . Indeed , 2 h of stretch did not increase the number of cells entering S phase , as 1 Huntsman Cancer Institute , University of Utah , 2000 Circle of Hope , Salt Lake City , Utah 84102 , USA . © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Moreover , other reports find that stretch induces epithelial cells to enter the cell cycle but reach G1 after only 6 h 6 – 8 . To determine whether stretch acti - vates mitosis at G2 or M , we tested whether stretch stimulates cyclin B , which accumulates in the cytoplasm at G2 . To prevent cyclin B deg - radation as cells shift into mitosis , we measured cytoplasmic cyclin B accumulation in the presence of the CDK1 inhibitor , roscovitine . We found that stretch induces cytoplasmic cyclin B accumulation over time ( Fig . 3a and Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . Inhibiting Piezo1 with gadolin - ium or transcription with α - amanitin blocks stretch - induced cyclin B synthesis ( Fig . 3a ) , suggesting that stretch - induced cyclin B induction requires both Piezo1 and transcription . However , because Piezo1 is a transmembrane protein that relays calcium in response to mechani - cal stress 3 , 9 – 11 , it probably activates transcription indirectly . Inhibiting calcium with either ruthenium red or BAPTA - AM blocked stretch - induced mitosis and cyclin B production , respectively , confirming that Piezo1 acts through calcium to activate mitosis ( Fig . 3b , c ) . Videos of MDCK monolayers expressing CMV - R - GECO1 ( ref . 12 ) reveal that a single spark of calcium precedes mitosis entry ( noted by physiological cell rounding ) by 65 min ( Extended Data Fig . 5b , c ) . Because both cyclin B and mitosis require Piezo1 and calcium influx ( Fig . 3b , c ) , we next inves - tigated what induces proliferation in response to calcium influx . A top candidate is the extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK1 ) , a calcium - activated target of MEK1 / 2 ( refs 13 – 15 ) with roles in controlling G2 / M 16 – 18 . We found that stretch - induced calcium activates ERK1 / 2 ( measured by phospho - ERK1 / 2 immunoblot ) within only 5 min , but is blocked by gadolinium addition ( Fig . 3d ) . Using the MEK1 / 2 inhibitor AZD6244 ( and U0126 , not shown ) , we found that both stretch - induced mitosis and synthesis of cyclin B require the ERK1 / 2 – MEK1 / 2 pathway ( Fig . 3b , c ) . Thus , we propose that stretch causes Piezo1 to trigger calcium currents that activate ERK1 / 2 via MEK1 / 2 , which triggers cyclin B transcription and initiate mitosis ( Fig . 3e ) . It is curious that one protein , Piezo1 , can control two opposing processes—cell division and cell death—to regulate cell numbers .

However , the type of mechanical tension is crucial for the type of response : we find that stretch induces cell division but not cell extrusion , whereas crowding induces cell extrusion but not cell division ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Notably , the magnitude of mechanical strain for each response is similar : 1 . 5 – 1 . 7 - fold stretch induces cell division whereas 1 . 7 – 1 . 8 - fold crowding induces cell extrusion 1 ( Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . Similar paradoxical signalling controls opposing outcomes in other systems , but typically through secreted molecules 19 – 21 . For instance , IL - 2 maintains homeostatic T cell numbers by controlling both cell division and cell death depending on the levels secreted 21 . Thus , Piezo1 signalling through calcium may represent a new mechanism for regulating a paradoxical feedback loop . While the benefit of having a single regulator control two opposing processes is that its loss should downregulate both processes , Piezo1 mutations and misexpression frequently found in colorectal , gastric and 30 60 90 120 0 200 400 600 Time after stretch ( min ) C y c li n B + ce ll s p e r 10 , 000 ce ll s Gd 3 + α - amanitin No stretch Control a d - 5 Gadolinium 15 0 0 5 15 p - E R K 1 / 2 A c t i n Control p - ERK1 / 2 after stretch Control BAPTA - AM R red AZD6244 0 20 40 60 H P 3 + ce ll s p e r 10 , 000 ce ll s NSS NSS * * * * * * * * * * * b Control BAPTA - AM R red AZD6244 0 200 400 600 C y c li n B + ce ll s p e r 10 , 000 ce ll s * * * * * * * * * * * * c e Ca 2 + Piezo1 Microtubules Cell – cell junctions ERK1 / 2 Cyclin B Wound or stretch Epithelia at steady state Stretch - induced mitosis Figure 3 | Stretch - activation of Piezo1 triggers calcium and ERK1 / 2 - dependent cyclin B transcription . a , Stretch induces cyclin B accumulation ( with CDK1 inhibition ) , which is blocked by Gd 3 + or α - amanitin .

Future work is needed to determine whether Piezo1 misregulation is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis , and if the relevant mutations affect both epithelial cell death and division . We next sought to determine how Piezo1 differentially interprets crowding versus stretching . Cellular responses could depend on how the cell is primed , the levels and localization of Piezo1 , as well as the type of tension . Our findings show that stretch - activation of Piezo1 target cells primed in early G2 to divide rapidly . It is not clear whether Piezo1 also collaborates with the transcriptional regulators Yap , Taz and β - catenin upon stretch to promote cell cycle entry at the G1 phase 6 , 8 , although it is a tempting prospect , since tension - dependent nuclear translocation of Yap requires Piezo1 in neuronal stem cells 26 . Older , crowded cells prone to extrusion may be post - mitotic , as typically seen in villus tips , and less likely to divide in response to calcium . The type of mechanical tension may also have a role in how Piezo1 signals . We find that while chemical activation of calcium currents is sufficient to activate cell division , it is not sufficient to promote cell extrusion and death ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Thus , either thapsigargin or the calcium iono - phore A23187 activates calcium at sites required for mitosis , or crowd - ing - induced extrusion requires mechanical crowding in addition to calcium currents . Finally , the ability of Piezo1 to sense different types of tension may depend on its subcellular localization and levels . At subconfluence , Piezo1 levels are low , mainly localizing to the nuclear envelope , but accumulate over time . In confluent but sparser epithelial regions prone to divide , Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum , whereas in crowded regions prone to extrude , Piezo1 develops into large cytoplasmic aggregates ( Fig . 4e ) . Notably , although Piezo1 accumulates over time , stretching dense MDCK mon - olayers either mechanically or by wounding causes Piezo1 levels to drop markedly and eventually relocalize to the nucleus ( Fig . 4f ) . At lower densities , when Piezo1 is predominantly at the nucleus , stretch does not appear to have a significant role in regulating mitosis ( Extended Data Fig . 7b , c ) , potentially because the division rate is already very high . In this way , Piezo1 levels and localization could adjust to regulate cell numbers once cells reach a steady state : in sites where cells are sparse , Piezo1 localizes to sites where it may sense stretch , whereas in sites where cells are older and crowded , Piezo1 accumulates into structures where it may sense crowding ( Extended Data Fig . 6b ) . Excessive cell death or wounding may reset the cell clock by degrading Piezo1 so that it would start measuring cell numbers only once cells reach the steady state again . Future studies will need to test whether Piezo1 abundance and localization control its response to different mechanical forces . Our work has defined a role for mechanical tensions regulating con - stant epithelial cell numbers , essential for maintaining a tight barrier and preventing cancers from forming . We have found that Piezo1 acts to link the number of cells dying with those dividing by measuring tensions . If epithelial cells become too dense , crowding induces some cells to extrude and die , but if they become too sparse , stretch triggers some cells to divide rapidly to equilibrate epithelia to optimal densities .

MDCK II cells ( tested for mycoplasma but not authenticated ) ( gift from K . Matlin ) were cultured in DMEM high glucose with 5 % FBS ( Atlas , Biologicals ) and 100 μ g ml − 1 penicillin / streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) at 5 % CO 2 , 37 °C . Cell stretching was done using a custom - designed Teflon chamber fabricated to culture cells on a flexible silicone membrane ( 2 × 2 . 4 cm , 0 . 5 mm thickness ) 1 . Before cell seeding , 2 × 2 . 4 cm silicone membranes were stretched and coated with 5 μ g ml − 1 fibronectin ( Sigma ) at 37 °C for 1 h . To stretch membranes with our device , one edge of the silicone membrane was clamped in place , while the other side was clamped to a movable shaft , which moves through a Teflon chamber with a sealing gasket . The movable shaft was pulled out between 2 and 6 mm , resulting in stretch of 10 – 33 % . Approximately 2 . 5 × 10 6 cells were plated onto the 2 × 2 . 4 cm silicone matrices in a neutral taut state in the device and grown to confluence , then stretched to desired lengths with control chambers being left in a neutral state . Epithelial monolayers were fixed in stretched or neutral state and stained . As an alternative stretching method , 2 × 10 6 cells were grown to con - fluence in pronectin - coated flexcell plates designed for uniaxial stretch ( Flexcell International Corporation ) , and stretched by clamping onto a custom - designed base plate ( publicly available at https : / / www . shapeways . com / as ‘Narrow Bump Base in white strong flexible nylon plastic’ ) using two ‘Clamp Bars in Stainless Steel’ ( Shapeways ) . The clamp bars and base must be tapped with a 0 . 25 inch ( 6 . 35 mm ) - 20 tap to match steel 0 . 25 inch - 20 fully threaded studs and rods and capped with knurled style thumbscrews ( both Essentra Components ) . Wounding assays and live cell imaging . Control MDCK II cells or those express - ing a pTRIPZ piezo1 shRNA construct were grown to confluence in 24 - well glass bottom dishes ( MatTek ) or 8 - chamber slides ( Labtek , Fisher Scientific ) . Cells were treated with 1 . 5 μ g ml − 1 doxycycline ( Sigma ) for 48 h to knockdown Piezo1 . For wounding experiments , monolayers were scratched with a 10 - μ l pipet tip . Cells were imaged in complete DMEM supplemented with 10 mM HEPES ( Invitrogen ) on a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope at 37 °C or an EVOS FL Auto with a Stable Z controller heated stage ( Bioptechs ) at 37 °C . Time - lapse videos were analysed using ImageJ . For calcium imaging , MDCK cells were transfected with CMV - R - GECO1 , a gift from R . Campbell ( Addgene plasmid 32444 ) 12 and imaged continuously ( 3 = s intervals ) for 4 h . For cell cycle imaging , MDCK cells were transfected with pEGFP - PCNA - IRES - puro2b , a gift from D . Gerlich ( Addgene plasmid 26461 ) 1 . Cells were imaged with a Nikon wide - field microscope at 37 °C coupled to an Andor Clara interline CCD camera . Drug treatments . The following drugs were used in experiments : 10 μ M gadolin - ium ( iii ) chloride ( for both zebrafish and cell culture ) to block Piezo1 , and 30 μ M ruthenium red or 10 μ M BAPTA - AM was used to inhibit calcium ( all from Sigma ) ; 10 μ M roscovitine was used to block CDK1 ; 5 μ M α - amanitin ( Sigma ) was used to inhibit RNA polymerase II and III ; 1 μ M AZD6244 ( Cayman Chemical ) or 1 μ M U0126 ( Sigma ) was used to inhibit MEK1 and MEK2 ; 1 μ M A23187 or 5 μ M thapsi - gargin ( both from Sigma ) was used to induce calcium influx . Cell immunostaining . Cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min . Fixed cells were rinsed three times in PBS , permeabilized for 10 min with PBS containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and blocked in AbDil ( PBS with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 2 % BSA ) , then incubated in primary antibody ( in AbDil ) for 1 h , washed three times with PBS and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and incubated in secondary antibodies . Antibody concentrations used for immunostaining were : 1 : 1 , 000 mouse phospho - histone H3 ( S10 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology ) ; 1 : 1 , 000 rabbit histone H3 ( phospho S10 ) ( Abcam ) ; 1 : 200 mouse β - catenin ( Cell Signaling Technology ) ; 1 : 200 rabbit cyclin B1 XP ( Cell Signaling Technology ) ; 1 : 200 rabbit Piezo1 ( Novus , NBP1 - 78446 ) . Only this Piezo1 antibody reliably worked for Piezo1 immunostaining , as it vanishes in cells mosaically expressing a Piezo1 - shRNA - mCherry construct ( Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . Actin was detected using 0 . 1 μ g ml − 1 Alexa Fluor 647 – phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . Replicating DNA was detected using a Click - it EdU labelling kit , according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Life Technologies ) . Alexa Fluor 488 , 568 and 647 goat anti - mouse and anti - rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . DNA was detected with 1 μ g ml − 1 DAPI in all fixed cell experiments . Fluorescent microscopy . Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 90i using a × 40 plan fluor 0 . 75 lens with a Retiga 2000R cooled mono 12 - bit camera ( Q Imaging ) driven by NIS Elements ( Nikon ) or on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope converted for spinning disc confocal microscopy ( Andor Technologies ) using a 20 × or 60 × plan fluor 0 . 95 oil lens with an electron - multiplied cooled CCD camera 1 , 000 × 1 , 000 , 8 × 8 mm 2 driven by the IQ software ( Andor Technologies ) . NIS Elements was used to quantify cell densities and measure cell length . Cell staining with cytoplasmic cyclin B1 or H3P was quantified per 10 , 000 cells using Nikon Elements Software . FACScan . One million MDCK II cells were collected by trypsin treatment and rinsing twice with 2 ml PBS . The cell pellet was resuspended in 250 μ l cold PBS and fixed for 2 h with 800 μ l ice - cold 100 % ethanol at − 20 °C . The tubes were warmed to 37 °C for 10 min and cells were washed twice with 1 and 2 ml PBS . The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μ l propidium iodide ( PI ) staining solution ( 50 μ g ml − 1 PI , 0 . 1 % Triton - X , 0 . 2 mg ml − 1 RNase A in PBS ) , vortexed and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C . The samples were filtered and then analysed for propidium iodide fluorescence with a BD FACScan Analyzer . Piezo1 knockdown and western blot analysis . Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) : For CRISPR - mediated knockdown of Piezo1 , exon 2 of the zebrafish piezo1 gene was targeted for CRISPR knockdown and the target sequence was GTAGCGAAATATGCAGGctgagg ( exonic sequence is uppercase , intronic sequence is lowercase ) . The 20 nucleotides minus the NGG motif were cloned into a plasmid containing the RNA loop structure required for recognition by the Cas9 enzyme and a T7 - binding site , which allowed for the synthesis of single - guide RNA ( sgRNA ) . To induce knockdown of Piezo1 , 75 pg of sgRNA and 1 , 200 pg of Cas9 - NLS encoding RNA were injected at the 1 - cell - stage into wild - type ( AB ) embryos and mitosis rates were measured in mosaic F 0 larvae at day 4 after ferti - lization . For Cas9 - NLS mRNA synthesis , pT3Ts - nCas9n was obtained from the Chen laboratory via Addgene ( 46757 ) . Piezo1 morphants were made by mixing 4 ng translation blocking morpholino 1 : 1 with a 25 bp antisense containing a photolinker and a 4 bp mismatch , and inject - ing into 1 - cell - stage wild - type ( AB ) embryos . At 28 – 32 hours after fertilization , embryos were exposed to 350 nm light for 20 s to activate the morpholino , then fixed and immunostained at 4 days post - fertilization . All experiments on zebrafish were done with accordance to our zebrafish IACUC protocol , approved by the University of Utah IACUC board . MDCKs : siRNA to canine Piezo1 mRNA ( from Sigma to the sense sequence GUGCUAUGGUCUCUGGGAUdTdT ) was transfected with RNAiMAX ( Thermofisher ) into MDCK cells 1 day after plating . For rescue , 1 μ g GFP – Piezo1 construct ( gift from A . Patapoutian ) was transfected after 1 day after addition of siRNA . Alternatively , a pTRIPZ human PIEZO1 lentiviral plasmid ( from Fisher Scientific to the sense sequence UGUCCUCCACACACAUCCA ) was transduced with psPAX and p60 ( gift from M . VanBrocklin ) into MDCK cells and selected for 14 days with 2 μ g ml − 1 puromycin , and expression was induced by treating with with 1 . 5 μ g ml − 1 doxycycline ( Sigma ) for 3 days . Cell lysate was obtained by trypsinising cells , resuspending the pellet in NP40 cell lysis buffer containing 1 × PMSF and protease inhibitors ( Life Technologies ) , and centrifuging for 10 min at 16 , 873 g at 4 °C . Then 30 μ g of protein lysate ( determined by Bradford assay ) was run on a 3 – 8 % Tris - acetate gel at 150 V for 1 h , transferred to PVDF , and probed for Piezo1 ( Proteintech ) or mouse - anti - tubulin ( Sigma ) antibody by standard enhanced chemiluminescence . Statistical analysis . No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size . For statistical analysis , all experiments , including those in zebrafish , were repeated on three separate days to ensure enough variation and numbers to measure significance by unpaired t - tests . To ensure randomization of measurements , we took random pictures within the middle ( region of consistent stretch or crowding ) of silicone membrane for quantification . For zebrafish experiments , all fish were analysed , so not randomized or blinded . After noticing a trend in low - density epithelia not responding to stretch , we excluded them in our main data , but included them in Supplementary Fig . 4 . Variance between compared samples was similar and expressed as s . e . m . in graphs . Data availability .
