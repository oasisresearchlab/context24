Slit diaphragm proteins assemble into functional signaling complexes on a raft - based platform , but how the trafficking of these proteins coordinates with their signaling function is unknown . Here , we demonstrate that a raft - mediated endocytic ( RME ) pathway internalizes nephrin . Nephrin internalization was slower with raft - mediated endocytosis than with classic clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Ultrastructurally , the RME pathway consisted of noncoated invaginations and was dependent on cholesterol and dynamin . Nephrin constituted a stable , signaling - competent microdomain through interaction with Fyn , a Src kinase , and podocin , a scaffold protein . Tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin triggered its own RME - mediated internalization . Protamine - induced hyperphosphorylation of nephrin led to noncoated invaginations predominating over coated pits . These results demonstrate that an RME pathway couples nephrin internalization to its own signaling , suggesting that RME promotes proper spatiotemporal assembly of slit diaphragms during podocyte development or injury .

Ectodomain engagement of nephrin induces tyrosine phosphorylation via the Src - family kinases , which , in turn , leads to recruit - ment of an adaptor ( e . g . , Nck ) and subsequent actin reorganization . 4 , 5 SD proteins are organized within a specialized submicrodomain of the plasma membrane called rafts , liquid - ordered structures enriched in choles - terol and sphingolipids . They are therefore re - garded as lipid – protein supercomplexes formed by a dynamic lateral assembly of the microdomains . 6 Clustering of nephrin leads to sequential coales - cence of preexisting small rafts , thereby forming a large - scale , stable signal platform through selective sequestration of adaptors and scaffolds . 7 , 8 In podo - cyte foot processes , a raft - resident scaffold protein , podocin , and a CD2 - associated protein , CD2AP , facilitate the selective recruitment of signaling mol - Received January 5 , 2009 .

These observations indicated that the spatiotemporal regulation of nephrin is a critical determinant of SD leakiness ; however , the detailed mechanisms are still unclear . In this study , we focused on the role of endocytosis , a fundamental process that coordinates cell - surface expression and signal transduction . 16 In mammalian cells , endocytosis is mediated via two principal routes : clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis ( CME ) and clathrin - independent , raft - mediated endocy - tosis ( RME ) . 16 – 19 CME targets proteins to the early endosome , a sorting station directing vesicles to either recycling or degra - dation . Besides this “classic” CME pathway , RME has recently been the focus of intensive research , uncovering a new concept that the microdomain itself behaves as a vehicle for internal - ization . RME is generally defined by its clathrin independence , cholesterol sensitivity , and a typical morphology of smooth invaginations . 18 , 19 Several subtypes of RME pathways are dif - ferentially regulated by caveolin , dynamin , and a small GT - Pase , and they have been implicated in diverse biologic pro - cesses ( e . g . , viral infection , immunologic reactions , receptor signaling ) . 19 Podocytes can internalize circulating proteins as well as SD constituents . 20 – 22 In nephrotic podocytes , the number of en - docytic vesicles is markedly increased and nephrin is down - regulated and / or dislocated . 23 , 24 In view of accumulating evi - dence that SD proteins are assembled into functional signal complexes on a raft - based platform , we reasoned that an RME pathway could play a key role in spatiotemporal regulation of nephrin ; however , it is still unclear how nephrin specifies CME or RME pathways and how these trafficking routes are coordi - nated with the signaling function . This study is the first to demonstrate that nephrin traffics via RME in cultured cells and podocytes in vivo . The results point to the possibility that this new RME pathway is implicated in remodeling and develop - ment of foot processes ; these observations should attract fur - ther research focusing on disease pathogenesis and drug dis - covery . RESULTS Internalized Nephrin Is Sorted into Endosomal Compartments We first traced the nephrin endocytic pathway using transfected COS - 7 cells , 25 because they have a favorable morphology for quantificationandtheyinternalizenephrininasimilarmannertoculturedpodocytes ( SupplementalFigure1 ) . Attheearlyphaseof internalization ( 2 min ) , nephrin was taken up into fine punctate structures near the cell periphery ( Figure 1 , A through C ) . The numbersofcytoplasmicvesiclesat2minweresignificantlygreaterthanthoseattime0 ( no temperature shift to 37°C after surface labeling ; data not shown ) . Internalized nephrin only partially overlapped with transferrin , a CME marker ( 9 . 9 (cid:2) 1 . 8 % ) , chol - era - toxin B ( CTxB ) subunit , an RME marker ( 15 . 2 (cid:2) 2 . 5 % ) , and EEA1 , anearlyendosomemarker ( 8 . 7 (cid:2) 1 . 2 % ) . Thissuggeststhat these organelles represent nascent , incoming endocytic interme - diates that are in transition to mature early endosomes ( Supple - mentalFigure2 ) . 19 , 26 Whencellswereallowedtoendocytosecon - tinually for 20 min ( Figure 1 , D through G ) , nephrin became sorted into larger vesicular organelles and distributed broadly from the cell periphery to the perinuclear area . The endocytic structures at 20 min were remarkably co - localized with CTxB ( 52 . 1 (cid:2) 2 . 8 % ) andEAA1 ( 31 . 7 (cid:2) 1 . 7 % ) butonlypartiallywiththe late endosome marker LAMP - 2 ( 8 . 4 (cid:2) 2 . 7 % ; data not shown ) . This indicated that additional nephrin was trafficked to early en - dosomes enriched in lipid rafts . By contrast , nephrin was co - lo - calized to a lesser degree with transferrin ( 10 . 8 (cid:2) 0 . 4 % ) , which was taken up much faster and condensed in the perinuclear re - gions . There was little if any co - localization of nephrin with the fluid - phase marker dextran at either stage of internalization ( data not shown ) . These observations suggest that nephrin is initially sorted into a peripheral pre - endosomal intermediate and be - comes increasingly incorporated into an EEA1 - positive , lipid raft – enriched compartment at later times . Ultrastructure of Early Endocytic Intermediates on the Plasma Membrane We next used electron microscopy to visualize the ultrastruc - ture of endocytic vehicles for nephrin in transfected COS - 7 cells . At 2 min , immunogold labeling showed that nephrin localized predominantly to the plasma membrane in flat re - gions and in invaginations , as well as to intracellular vesicles . Some nephrin also associated with coated structures at the cell surface and in the subplasmalemma zone ( clathrin - coated pits or vesicles ; Figure 2 , A and C ) . In addition , we detected neph - rin in 50 - to 75 - nm diameter noncoated , smooth membrane invaginations , which resembled caveolae , a canonical raft - based endocytic organelle ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . 8 , 27 Quantitative analysis of a total of 237 nephrin - gold particles counted at 2 min of internalization revealed that 15 % of surface - labeled nephrin was associated with nonclathrin structures , whereas 4 % was with clathrin - coated structures and 58 % was still at the plasma membrane ( Figure 2D ) . The data indicated that neph - rin is internalized via morphologically distinct endocytic inter - mediates of both coated and noncoated types . Nephrin Internalizes via Two Distinct Endocytic Routes To explore the detailed mechanisms of the endocytosis , we examined the effects of dominant negative mutants on nephrin trafficking . A dynamin - 2a K44A mutant inhibits most but not all endocytic pathways by perturbing scission of invaginated pits from the plasma membrane . 17 , 19 In COS - 7 cells , dy - namin - 2a K44A showed a marked inhibition of nephrin inter - BASIC RESEARCH www . jasn . org J Am Soc Nephrol 20 : 2534 – 2545 , 2009 Nephrin Endocytosis and Signaling 2535 nalization at both 2 and 20 min by 75 . 9 (cid:2) 2 . 2 % and 64 . 2 (cid:2) 2 . 5 % , respectively ( Figure 3 , A and C ) . This indicated that a dynamin - based fission mechanism is required for both the RME and CME pathways . The Eps15 (cid:3) 95 / 295 mutant inter - feres with clathrin - coated pit assembly by binding to the AP - 2 adaptor , thereby specifically blocking the CME pathway . Eps15 (cid:3) 95 / 295 significantly blocked nephrin internalization at 2 min by 77 . 4 (cid:2) 2 . 5 % , whereas it only slightly inhibited neph - rin uptake at 20 min by 23 . 3 (cid:2) 4 . 4 % ( Figure 3 , B and C ) . Together , these results indicate that a portion of nephrin rap - idly enters the cells via the CME pathway while even more nephrin is internalized by the nonclathrin RME route as endo - cytosis proceeds . We next examined the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors : Potassium chloride - deficient media were used because they inhibit CME through disruption of the clathrin - lattice assem - bly , 16 and methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin ( M (cid:1) CD ) , a cholesterol - depleting reagent , was used because it primarily inhibits the RME path - way but also interferes to some extent with the CME route . 28 , 29 Potassium depletion blocked nephrin endocytosis mainly at the early time points ( 2 min , by 67 . 5 (cid:2) 1 . 3 % compared with control ) while inhibiting the later phase uptake to a lesser degree ( 20 min , by 46 . 9 (cid:2) 1 . 6 % ; Supplemental Figure 3 ) . Conversely , inhibition of nephrin up - take was more pronounced by treatment with M (cid:1) CD at later stages ( 20 min ; 63 . 1 (cid:2) 1 . 9 % ) than at earlier stages ( 2 min ; 48 . 8 (cid:2) 2 . 4 % ) . This indicated that the later stages of endocytosis were more cholesterol depen - dent than the early phases . These results again support the notion that the CME pathway allows rapid internalization of nephrin , whereas the RME route mediates a much slower entry . Nephrin Forms a Microdomain via Dynamic Lateral Raft Assembly Compartmentalization of nephrin into spe - cific membrane microdomains is potentially a key mechanism for its own selective sorting into RME pathways . To address this possibil - ity , we performed co - patching experiments . When nephrin and GM1 were clustered on the cell surface by an anti - nephrin antibody and CTxB , respectively , the nephrin patches efficientlyco - clusteredwithGM1 ( Figure4 , A through C ) . Co - patching of nephrin was ob - served with another raft marker , GFP - fused glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI - GFP ; Figure 4 , D through F ) . Notably , a nonraft marker , transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , was spatially segregated from nephrin patches ( Figure 4 , G through I ) . The extent of nephrin co - localization with GMI and GPI - GFP ( 65 . 4 (cid:2) 3 . 7 and 59 . 5 (cid:2) 2 . 6 % , respectively ) was more remarkable than TfR ( 20 . 6 (cid:2) 5 . 0 % ; Figure 4 K ) . These data indicate that nephrin microdomains share a common liquid - ordered composition with the raft marker GM1 and GPI but not TfR , thereby constituting a highly specific subset of mi - crodomains . Nephrin Interacts and Co - internalizes with the Scaffold Protein Podocin Because nephrin co - localizes with podocin at the SD in vivo , we reasoned that interactions between these two proteins may have relevance in regulation of the RME . To address this issue , Figure 1 . Nephrin is internalized in pre - and early endosomal compartments . A single nephrin transfectant of COS - 7 cells ( no Fyn overexpression ) was surface - labeled using an anti - nephrin ectodomain antibody and was internalized at 37 (cid:4) C . Cells were double labeled with the endocytic markers of CME ( transferrin [ Tfn ] ; A and D ) , RME ( CTxB ; B and E ) , and the early endosomes ( EEA1 ; C and F ) . ( Insets ) Magnified views of boxed areas . Bar (cid:5) 10 (cid:2) m . At very early times ( 2 min ) , nephrin distributes at the cell periphery and co - localizes to some extent with Tfn ( A ) , CTxB ( B ) , and , to a lesser degree , EEA1 ( C ) . As endocytosis proceeds over a longer period of time ( 20 min ) , nephrin becomes sorted into a larger punctate structure that distributes evenly over the peripheral sorting endosomes . ( E and F ) Incoming nephrin overlaps markedly with CTxB ( E ) and EAA1 ( F ) . Note that nephrin merges only slightly with Tfn ( D ; a CME marker taken up more rapidly than nephrin ) .

BASIC RESEARCH www . jasn . org 2536 Journal of the American Society of Nephrology J Am Soc Nephrol 20 : 2534 – 2545 , 2009 we examined the biochemical basis for nephrin - podocin inter - actions . A sucrose gradient floating assay of COS - 7 cells and isolated rat glomeruli demonstrated that nephrin co - separates with podocin into a low - buoyant , detergent - resistance mem - brane fraction in a cholesterol - dependent manner ( Supple - mental Figure 4 , A through C ) . We next examined how internalization of these two pro - teins is coordinated . At a steady state in nephrin - podocin dou - ble - transfected COS - 7 cells , podocin displayed a punctate ves - icle pattern scattering throughout the cytoplasm with some linear staining at cell edges , whereas nephrin exhibited a fine reticular distribution with only a few scattered puncta ( data not shown ) . At early steps of internalization ( 2 min ; Supple - mental Figure 4 , D and E ) , incoming nephrin showed little co - localization with podocin , indicating that nephrin initially enters cells independent of podocin . In contrast , at later times ( 20 min ) , internalized nephrin was increasingly sorted into larger , brighter endocytic structures that co - localized with podocin . Quantification analysis demonstrated that the extent of nephrin co - localization with podocin at 20 min ( 49 . 6 (cid:2) 2 . 9 % ) was four - fold greater than at 2 min ( 11 . 7 (cid:2) 1 . 4 % ) . Im - munoprecipitation as well as GST pull - down assays demon - strated the ability of podocin to bind nephrin and vice versa ( data not shown ) . The data indicate that nephrin physically interacts with podocin through the rafts and is co - internalized with podocin primarily along the RME pathway . Diffusional Mobility of Nephrin Is Restricted by Podocin To examine the role of podocin in coordinating the nephrin microdomains , we examined diffusional mobility of GFP - nephrin in living cells by fluorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( FRAP ) techniques . 25 Wild - type L cells ( L - wt ) or L cells stably expressing podocin ( L - pod ) were transiently trans - fected with GFP - nephrin ( L - wt GFP - nephrin and L - pod GFP - Figure 2 .

As shown in Figure 5 , A and B , in L - wt GFP - nephrin cells , fluorescence intensity reached a plateau at 70 % of the prebleached level , with a recovery time of 60 to 90 s ( n (cid:5) 6 ) . In contrast , in L - pod GFP - nephrin cells , the fluorescence inten - sity recovered to only approximately 60 % of the ini - tial level , indicating that podocin enhanced seques - tration of GFP - nephrin into the immobile fraction 1 . 3 - fold ( 39 . 7 (cid:2) 2 . 9 % ) compared with the control ( 29 . 6 (cid:2) 7 . 3 % ; n (cid:5) 8 to 10 ; P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ; Figure 5 , C and D ) . After treatment with 10 mM M (cid:1) CD for 30 min at 37°C , both L - wt GFP - nephrin and L - pod GFP - nephrin cells recovered fluorescence to levels similar to prebleaching ( 25 . 2 (cid:2) 3 . 3 and 23 . 3 (cid:2) 3 . 7 % , respec - tively ; n (cid:5) 6 ; Figure 5 , C and D ) . The FRAP proper - ties did not significantly differ among the bleach sites ( peripheral or perinuclear portions ) or cell types ( i . e . , COS - 7 cells ; data not shown ) . The data indicate that podocin restricts diffusive motion of nephrin in a cholesterol - dependent manner . Nephrin Signaling Is Functionally Linked to Endocytosis In view of recent studies showing that the RME path - way is a triggered process , 8 , 19 we investigated whether nephrin signaling is linked to the endocytic process . Tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin was augmented by coexpression of an active form of Fyn ( Y531F ) in COS - 7 cells , whereas it was attenuated in the presence of the Src - family kinase inhibitor PP2 and by an inactive form of Fyn ( K299M ; Supplemen - tal Figure 5A ) , suggesting that nephrin signaling is Fyn dependent . Antibody - mediated clustering of nephrin at the cell surface caused a dramatic change in the intracellular distribution of Fyn , inducing large discrete puncta , in contrast to the fine , evenly dispersed pattern in control cells ( Supplemental Fig - ure 5B ) . To test directly the role of cytoplasmic ty - rosine phosphorylation in endocytic trafficking , we created a nephrin double mutant , Y1176F / Y1193F , in which two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites are mutated to phenylalanine ( Supplemental Figure 6 ) . 4 , 5 Fyn - mediated phosphorylation of the Y1176F / Y1193F construct was significantly reduced ( Figure 6A ) . Despite no appreciable alterations at 2 min of internalization in COS - 7 cells , the underphosphory - lated Y1176F / Y1193F exhibited more remarkable re - tention near the cell periphery at 20 min of uptake ( Figure 6B ) . These data indicate that underphospho - rylation of nephrin perturbs its own RME . To test whether activated endocytic pathways re - ciprocally affect spatiotemporal signal propagation , we examined the effects of pathway - specific inhibi - tors on nephrin phosphorylation ( Figure 6 , C and D ) . In control COS - 7 cells coexpressing nephrin and Fyn , phosphorylation of nephrin reached a maximum level at 2 min and gradually declined to the initial value during the sub - sequent 20 min . This suggests that the rates of assembly and breakdown of signaling - competent microdomains become equilibrated at 20 min . A CME pathway – specific inhibitor , Figure 4 .

These results raised the possibility that the CME pathway is not di - rectly implicated in the initial signal event but that its selective blockage attenuates signaling as a result of compensatory in - duction of the alternative RME pathway ( s ) 16 , 30 A dynamin - 2a K44A construct , a universal inhibitor for both RME and CME pathways , prolongs the time that nephrin is engaged in signaling at the plasma membrane . This mutant caused a slight increase in nephrin phosphorylation at 20 min while exerting little effect at 2 min ( Figure 6 , C and D ) . These data indicate that the signaling - competent microdo - main enters the cells via RME at a slow rate , thereby downregulating the signaling complexes . Uncoated Plasma Membrane Invaginations in Protamine Sulfate – Treated Podocytes To investigate the physiologic relevance of nephrin endocytosis , we examined the ultrastructure of foot processes in a protamine sulfate ( PS ) - induced rat podocyte injury model . 31 PS perfusion induces in - creased phosphorylation of the SD proteins . More - over , it leads to a reversible foot process effacement and SD dislocation without any destructive tissue damage , thereby providing a suitable model for ul - trastructural analysis of endocytic vesicles . Electron microscopy of the lateral domain in PS - treated foot processes revealed plasma membrane invaginations with diameters of 50 to 100 nm , a morphology sim - ilar to that observed in cultured cells ( Figure 2 ) . Membrane buddings in foot processes were signifi - cantly more abundant in the PS - model than in con - trols ( no pits in (cid:7) 200 randomly selected foot pro - cesses ) . In PS - treated foot processes , the proportion of noncoated smooth invaginations was greater than that of coated pits around the SD ( 82 (cid:2) 4 % ; n (cid:5) 67 ; Figure 7 ) . These data suggest that a fraction of neph - rin is endocytosed via a nonclathrin carrier in vivo , particularly in situations in which the podocyte is actively phosphorylated ( Figure 8 ) . DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that nephrin is internalized via dynamin - dependent RME pathways , in addition to the widely known classic CME route . Vesicle - like , noncoated vesicles were morphologically distinct from those of previously reported dynamin - inde - pendent RME formations , whereby tubular / ring - like structures internalize the raft proteins ( e . g . , GPI - linked proteins , flotillins , fluid - phase markers ; Supplemental Figure 2 ) . 19 , 26 , 32 We propose a new model of nephrin endocytosis in which the RME pathway coordinates endocytic trafficking and its signaling and may be implicated in the spatiotemporal assem - bly of SD complexes ( Figure 8 ) . Role of RME in Regulation of the Lipid – Protein Supercomplex Our results indicate that raft microdomains act as an organiz - ing platform for an efficient coupling of signaling to endocy - tosis . Several features of RME seem ideally suited for such a Figure 5 . Diffusional mobility of nephrin is restricted by the scaffold podo - cin .

BASIC RESEARCH www . jasn . org J Am Soc Nephrol 20 : 2534 – 2545 , 2009 Nephrin Endocytosis and Signaling 2539 functional interplay . First , the RME pathway allows co - inter - nalization of high - ordered multimers , leaving the specific composition of microdomains unchanged . The RME pathway can endocytose relatively large cargo , such as viruses , bacteria , and focal adhesion complexes of detached cells , thereby sug - gesting that it represents a primitive form of trafficking ma - chinery . 8 , 33 Unlike CME , RME does not require cyclic assem - bly and disassembly of coated proteins during the endocytic process . This feature of RME allows the maintenance of iden - tical constituents throughout trafficking and thus confers a “fixed shuttle” without losing or exchanging any component . 8 Second , RME is an inducible process that internalizes neph - rin microdomains at a slower rate relative to the classic CME pathway . This feature of RME enables effective signal trans - duction by increasing the surface resident time of the function - ing platform and by an intimate interaction between signaling components . RME may be the most suit - able machinery for shaping the foot process architecture because it could allow the fine - ly - tuned , spatial confinement of multi - meric complexes at desirable locations ( e . g . , the SD ) . Third , RME enables functional coupling of endocytosis to its own signal - ing . In the past several years , a functional link between endocytosis and signaling has been actively explored . 16 For example , Sim - ian virus SV40 is internalized via the RME pathway through activation of tyrosine ki - nase – based signaling . 34 Such signal activa - tion , in turn , recruits dynamin to endocytic sites and loosens the linkage with the corti - cal actin cytoskeleton , thereby facilitating the budding of noncoated vesicles from the plasma membrane . In analogy to these ob - servations , our data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin represents a signal for its own endocytic trafficking and simultaneously constitutes a shutoff loop through the preferential removal of acti - vated signaling platforms from the cell sur - face . On the basis of these data , we propose a model in which the RME pathway allows highly selective uptake of phosphorylated nephrin in the remodeling area while leav - ing nonphosphorylated nephrin undis - turbed at its desirable location in the SD ( Figure 8 ) . Our data indicate that internalized nephrin via RME is sorted into the early endosomes , but the intracellular destina - tion of the RME pathway is still unclear . In light of previous studies with several mem - brane receptors , 12 critical questions includ - ing whether the RME directs nephrin to re - cycle back to the surface or to proceed en route to the degradation pathway warrant further characteriza - tion . Relevance of Raft - Mediated Endocytosis in Podocytes Previous studies showed that podocytes can endocytose circu - lating proteins , including complement components and li - poproteins . 20 – 23 Tracer experiments revealed that uptake oc - curs via clathrin - coated vesicles on both the apical and the basal surfaces , some of which are sorted in multivesicular bod - ies at later times . 10 , 21 Generally , noncoated smooth pits and vesicles are rarely observed at the ultrastructural level in nor - mal foot processes in vivo . This may be due in part to the slower kinetics of RME and / or the technical difficulty of fixing lipid - based structures , thereby making it difficult to encounter non - coated smooth pits in conventionally processed electron mi - croscopy specimens . Several studies have proposed that Figure 6 . Nephrin signaling is functionally coupled to its endocytic trafficking . ( A ) Nephrin Y1176F / Y1193F is hypophosphorylated . Lysates of a COS - 7 transfectant coexpressing nephrin ( wild - type or Y1176F / Y1193F ) and Fyn were immunoprecipi - tated by the PY20 antibody and immunoblotted with an anti - nephrin antibody . ( B ) Reduced uptake of nephrin Y1176F / Y1193F . A COS - 7 cell transfectant singly express - ing either wild - type or Y1176F / Y1193F ( no Fyn overexpression ) was surface - labeled with anti - nephrin antibody and allowed to internalize at 37 (cid:4) C . The underphosphory - lated nephrin Y1176F / Y1193F is poorly internalized at 20 min compared with wild - type nephrin . ( C and D ) Effects of pathway - specific dominant negative inhibitors on signal - ing . The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was examined in nephrin - Fyn coexpressing COS - 7 cells with or without inhibitors ( either Dyn2a K44A or Eps - 15 (cid:3) 95 / 295 ) . The cells were surface - labeled with anti - nephrin antibody at 4 (cid:4) C and then allowed to endocy - tose at 37 (cid:4) C . Tyrosine - phosphorylated nephrin was detected by immunoblotting the PY20 antibody – derived immunoprecipitates with anti - nephrin antibody . Equivalent loading was confirmed by immunoblotting whole - cell lysates ( C ) . The degree of nephrin phosphorylation is quantified and graphed as a change ( fold ) of time 0 versus time 2 and 20 min ( D ) . Data are means (cid:2) SEM from four to seven separate experiments .

Mice lacking CD2AP or Fc recep - tors exhibited defective endocytosis in foot processes with glo - merular immunodeposits , pointing to the importance of en - docytic clearance by podocytes . 10 , 22 The detailed mechanisms underlying these observations must await further studies . Under in vivo conditions , nephrin molecules in podocytes in - teractwitheachothernotonlyin cis ( sidebyside ) butalsoin trans ( head to head ) manner . The limitation of our antibody cross - linkingapproachinthisstudyisthatitcouldreflectonlythelateralassemblyofmicrodomainsintheplaneoftheplasmamembrane ( cis - interaction ) . Another caveat of our studies is that our cul - tured cells all are of epithelial lineage and devoid of cell – cell junc - tions ; therefore , other experimental models , such as Heymann nephritis , whereby the SD is actively phosphorylated , may allow better characterization of the RME process . 11 Mechanisms for Sorting Nephrin into RME Pathways Rafts are small ( 10 to 200 nm ) and dynamic ( half - life 0 . 1 ms to 1 . 0 s ) , 29 and heterogeneous microdomains are likely captured by endocytic vesicles . In contrast to CME , in which specific adaptors recruitcargotothecoatedpits , sortingadaptorsforRMEhavenot yet been fully defined . An attractive hypothesis is that microdo - main assembly plays a key role in sorting nephrin into RME . Se - questration of nephrin into microdomains increases its time of residence at the plasma membrane , thereby protecting nephrin from nonspecific diffusion or internalization through the consti - tutively active CME pathway or passive bulk flow . Our live - cell FRAP analysis showed that nephrin microdomains are stabilized in the presence of podocin . A study of membrane dynamics dem - onstrated that immobilization of the microdomains occurs tran - siently before their budding into cells . 35 In light of these observa - tions , we speculate that the role of podocin is to organize microdomains so that RME could operate in a highly regulated manner . Podocin could allow highly site - specific , finely tuned budding at the plasma membrane by compartmentalizing mem - branelipidsandendocyticadaptorsnecessaryformembranecur - vatureandbuddingandbyprotectingthemfromnonspecificdif - fusion or internalization . 27 Previous studies showed that caveolin , a scaffold protein structurally similar to podocin , is involved in some RME path - ways . Moreover , it was reported that caveolin 1 physically in - teracts and co - localizes with nephrin in glomeruli 36 ; therefore , it is important to determine whether the smooth invaginations internalizing nephrin correspond to caveolin - positive “classi - cal” caveolae or a caveolin - negative , raft - derived morphologic equivalent ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . 18 , 19 Our caveolin 1 silenc - ing studies with cultured cells indicated that caveolin is not necessary for nephrin endocytosis ( Supplemental Figure 7 ) . Caveolae are highly immobile and regulated subdomains at the plasma membrane that , even after activation , are only slowly internalized ( half - time (cid:7) 20 min ) . This suggests that caveolae are not involved in endocytosis in podocytes under normal circumstances . 18 , 37 The lack of renal phenotypes in caveolin - null mice argues against its relevance in vivo . 17 , 27 The data col - lectively suggest that caveolin does not necessarily play a role in nephrin endocytosis . Relevance of the Classic CME Pathway At early steps of internalization , nephrin enters cells mainly via CME . Clathrin - coated pits are short - lived and highly mobile structures : They form and bud from the plasma membrane within 1 to 2 min and are recycled in approxi - Figure 7 .

Quack et al . 38 dem - onstrated that a fraction of nephrin is internal - ized via CME in association with (cid:1) - arrestin 2 , a clathrin - associated sorting protein . 39 (cid:1) - Arres - tin 2 preferentially binds to dephosphorylated nephrin that is disconnected from extracellular homophilic engagement and intracellular scaf - folds , thereby targeting the “free , ” nonraft frac - tion of nephrin into the CME pathway . Previ - ous studies demonstrated that nephrin phosphorylation is seen to some extent even under steady - state conditions but is remark - ably stimulated in particular situations in which rapid changes of cell shape and maximal cell – cell junction formation are required ( i . e . , developing and nephrotic podocytes ) . 4 , 5 , 11 (cid:1) - Arrestin 2 – mediated CME is possibly in - volved in internalization of dephosphorylated nephrin during remodeling of foot processes . In summary , we have characterized for the first time the RME pathway , which permits regulated entry of nephrin signaling microdomains into cells . We propose that cooperation between nephrin endocytosis and signaling is crucial for maintenance of SD integrity . Such coordinated functions become more important during podo - cyte development or injury , when signaling is ac - tivated to establish or restore cell – cell junctions . Endocytosis has been linked to a much more di - verse array of cellular processes than we previ - ously thought , including remodeling of cell shape and polarity . 19 , 33 Elucidation of more detailed mechanisms of podocyte endocytosis will thus in - crease our understanding of the pathogenesis of various proteinuric disorders . CONCISE METHODS Constructs , Cells , and Antibodies These details are provided as supplemental infor - mation . Internalization Assay All uptake studies were performed in COS - 7 cell trans - fectants expressing nephrin , with the exception of Sup - plemental Figure 1 , in which cultured podocytes were used . In all but one experiment ( Figure 6D ) , we used the COS - 7 / nephrin transfectants devoid of Fyn overex - pression , where nephrin is phosphorylated by endoge - nous Fyn . To label the surface nephrin , a divalent form of anti - nephrin antibody [ F ( ab (cid:9) ) 2 ] was used , because it Figure 8 . A model for differential sorting of nephrin along endocytic pathways is shown . ( A ) The SD is composed of the backbone nephrin , signaling molecules ( e . g . , Fyn ) , and scaffold proteins ( podocin ) , all of which reside individually in membrane microdomains . ( B ) Clustering of nephrin induces coalescence of microdomains that in turn leads to selective recruitment of the signaling com - ponents for its own tyrosine phosphorylation . Podocin facilitates the formation of a signaling platform and stabilizes the SD complex by linking it to the actin cytoskeleton of foot processes . ( C ) In the steady state , cell surface nephrin comprises two distinct membrane pools of raft and nonraft compartments . Most of the raft - resident nephrin molecules are organized into a largely immobile lipid – protein supercomplex in a dephosphorylated form , and they turn over at a slow rate in the foot processes . Clathrin - mediated machinery captures the membrane compartments spatially at random , irrespective of their raft associa - tion , and internalizes them quickly at a constant rate . (cid:1) - Arrestin 2 preferentially binds to the nonraft , dephosphorylated nephrin form and directs it toward the CME pathway . 38 This pathway ensures fast and continuous replacement of surface nephrin from a reservoir of its intracellular vesicles , thereby maintaining its steady - state surface expression level . Conversely , the nephrin residing within the functional signaling platform is internalized via a distinct , raft - enriched endocytic structure that traffics at a slower rate ( the RME pathway ) . This pathway specifically internalizes the signal - activated domains containing phosphorylated nephrin , which in turn removes the signaling microdomains from the cell surface ( in a “shut - off” feedback loop ) . The RME therefore enables a finely tuned , spatiotemporal sequestering of the SD complex by minimizing unnecessary breakdown of the signaling platforms . Such cooperation between signaling and endocytosis is particularly important when podocytes assemble a new SD com - plex ( e . g . , during development and the remodeling processes that follow injury ) .

The recovery values were expressed as pixel intensity and were normalized by the average prebleach val - ues of each region of interest ( Supplemental Figures 8 and 9 ) . The half - time required for the bleached fluorescence to rise to 50 % of the full recovery value ( t 1 ⁄ 2 ) and mobile fractions were estimated by nonlinear regression to a function for lateral diffusion .
