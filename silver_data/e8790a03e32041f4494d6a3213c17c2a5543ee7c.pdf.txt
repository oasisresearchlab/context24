Finger orientation input with pitch and yaw input can enlarge the input space for tabletops as well as for mobile de - vices . the main input technique . In current systems , a ﬁnger touch - ing a screen or surface is typically reduced to simple two - dimensional coordinates . A large body of research proposes to enrich such a touch interaction . In particular , previous work suggests using the orientation of a ﬁnger touching a surface as a means of input . For example , Wang et al . [ 23 ] adapted menus to ﬁnger orientation , Takeoaka et al . [ 21 ] used the an - gle of ﬁnger pitch as an input parameter , and Kratz et al . [ 14 ] enabled 3D touch gestures . A number of commercial systems , including devices by Multitaction 1 and the Microsoft Surface Hub 2 are now able toangle of ﬁnger pitch as input parameter sense the ﬁnger orientation and the angle of approach on an interactive surface . While previous work has suggested compelling ways to use the ﬁnger orientation as input and technology that cangle of ﬁnger pitch as input parameteran sense the orientation is now available , common commercial systems do not yet use ﬁn - ger orientation as part of the interaction . One reason is that the orientation of the ﬁnger is restricted by the physiological constraints of the user’s hand . Considering a ﬂat surface in 1 multitaction . com / last accessed : 05 - 17 - 2017 2 microsoft . com / microsoft - surface - hub / last accessed : 05 - 17 - 2017 front of a user , there are ﬁnger orientations in which touch is uncomfortable or even impossible to perform . As not all ﬁnger orientations can be used for the input , it is important to learn about users’ restrictions when designing orientation - aware input techniques . We propose readdressing the ergonomics of single - ﬁnger touch on interactive surfaces by investigating how systems can ef - fectively use different ﬁnger orientations . In this paper , we look closely at different ﬁnger orientations to understand the limitations they impose on the touch action . We systematically vary pitch and yaw conﬁgurations ( see Figure 1 ) to determine which ﬁnger orientations are optimal for touch interactions and when users ﬁnd it feasible to perform the touch action . To that end , we conducted a study where participants rated the perceived feasibility of the touch action when the ﬁnger pitch and yaw were varied independently . In a controlled experiment , we used pitch stabilizers to test 4 pitch values and 16 equally spaced yaw angles . Our ﬁndings indicate that pitch and yaw do signiﬁcantly affect perceived feasibility to perform a touch action . Further , we found that there is a sub - set of yaw angles at which users are comfortable performing touch actions , the comfort zone . Outside of this zone is the non - comfort zone , where the touch action is perceived to re - quire signiﬁcantly more effort , and some touch actions were found to be impossible to perform . Based on these results , we discuss design considerations for using ﬁnger orientation input in future applications . To summarize , this paper contributes the following : 1 . A systematic study of the perceived feasibility of a touch action with respect to ﬁnger pitch and yaw ; 2 . A characterization of the comfort and non - comfort zones for ﬁnger yaw input ; 3 . Design considerations for using ﬁnger orientation as an input modality . In the following sections , we review previous work that ad - dresses the nature of touch on interactive surfaces . We then present the details of our study design and the results of the experiment . Next , we interpret and discuss the implications of the data obtained . Finally , we present how our ﬁndings help to design future applications . RELATED WORK Enlarging the input space on touch devices has been the subject of a body of research . In this section , we provide an overview of research on touch input techniques as well as research addressing the ergonomics of touch . With the the success of mobile devices , touch - based interaction has become the dominant way of interacting with technology . However , compared to the use of indirect interaction tech - niques such as mouse , direct touch poses certain challenges . One such problem found by Siek et al . [ 20 ] is the fat ﬁnger problem . Holz and Baudisch further found that there is an off - set between the point where the user assumes to have touched the surface and their actual ﬁnger position [ 12 , 13 ] . They found that the touch offset is inﬂuenced by the angle of ﬁnger approach , and concluded that touch is not a 2 - dimensional in - teraction technique , but is a 3 - dimensional one . They showed that direct touch needs to be described by the 3D ﬁnger ori - entation with respect to the touch surface for pitch and roll gestures . Common touchscreens only provide the 2D position of the ﬁngers on the screen . To enrich the information gained from touch , a number of approaches have been proposed . Android , for example , enables access to the context menus with a long press and thereby uses dwell time as an additional input pa - rameter . With a similar motivation , Boring et al . [ 2 ] presented the fat thumb interaction technique , where the size of the touch can be used as an input parameter . Heo and Lee [ 10 ] proposed using force to augment touch and considered both normal and tangential forces . Recently Apple introduced 3D touch to ex - tend the interaction space of touch input . However , in 2008 Cao et al . [ 3 ] had already proposed ShapeTouch ; a system where the shape of the hand modiﬁes the action triggered when a touch occurs . Further , Goyal [ 5 ] builds upon that work to propose that shape - bending can also offer a novel vo - cabulary to a wide variety of 3D gestures that simulate touch , as an alternative to yaw and pitch . As is evident , signiﬁcant avenues are being constantly pursued to identify possibilities beyond the action of touch itself . Focusing speciﬁcally on ﬁxed horizontal surfaces like table - tops , Wang et al . [ 23 ] have proposed to adapt menus to ﬁnger orientation , e . g . for pie and torus menus . Finger orientation was also considered for creating novel interaction techniques for mobile devices . For example , understanding touch as a 3D ﬁnger orientation was the underlying concept of Z - touch by Takeoaka et al . [ 21 ] which used ﬁnger pitch angle as an input source , for controlling Bezier curves in a drawing applica - tion . Similarly , Kratz et al . [ 14 ] enabled 3D touch gesture detection by augmenting a tablet with a depth camera that captured the 3D space above the touchscreen . While Z - touch and the work by Kratz et al . [ 14 ] detect ﬁnger orientation using a vision - based sensing system , Rogers et al . [ 19 ] used a capacitive sensor array to detect the pitch and yaw of the ﬁnger . Zaliva [ 29 ] investigated detecting the ﬁnger orientation from the 2D contact point . Finally , Xiao et al . [ 28 ] used an off - the - shelf consumer touchscreen device to detect pitch and yaw gestures . While the proposed additional input dimensions enrich the input possibilities , this 3D gesture design space causes er - gonomic challenges . For example , Colley and Häkkilä [ 4 ] showed that pointing performance and gesture comfort of touch gestures vary with touch position and ﬁnger , whereby the lowest performance and comfort was found for the corners of the device , especially the top left one . The common direc - tion from which a ﬁnger approaches the screen was found to be from the bottom right for one - and two - handed interaction of right - handed users [ 1 ] . However , Hoggan et al . [ 11 ] , found that the feasibility of touch rotation depends on the rotation angle and input becomes harder when the hand rotation in - creases . Wolf et al . [ 26 ] further showed that the feasibility of pitch , yaw , drag , and ﬁnger lift gestures on hand - held de - vices depended on the grip and the touch location . They found that signiﬁcant modiﬁcations from the natural grasp cause ergonomic problems , especially for one - handed interaction . Le et al . [ 16 ] designers should concider ergonomic constraints when developing single - touch Back - of - Device ( Bod ) interac - tion techniques and therefore studies are needed to understand how users interact with devices . Beyond single - touch interac - tions , Lozano et al . [ 17 ] have shown that when designing new multitouch interaction techniques designers need to consider ergonomic factors . For example , Xiao et al . [ 28 ] identiﬁed additional ergonomic problems when using enriched touch input . Long ﬁngernails made a large pitch unfeasible to per - form . Xiao et al . [ 28 ] also restricted the yaw input to a range they “found comfortable to replicate in piloting” , thus they covered one third of the full 360 ◦ yaw range in their study . To reduce ergonomic problems they proposed to rotate the ﬁnger and the mobile device simultaneously , thus reducing the angle the ﬁnger actually had to be rotated . In the presented work we systematically vary pitch and yaw to better understand the ergonomic constraints when using pitch and yaw as an input . Overall , a body of recent work aims to extend the input space for touch interaction . A particularly active area aims to detect the 3D orientation of the ﬁnger that touches the screen and to use the pose as an additional input parameter . It is , however , unclear which ﬁnger orientations are actually feasible and er - gonomic . To extend the existing body of research on 3D touch gestures , this paper investigates the ergonomics of approach - ing a touch point with different ﬁnger orientations . We show that the ﬁnger pitch and yaw angle have an effect on feasibility , while the ﬁnger yaw angles can be divided into comfort and non - comfort zones . Our work addresses the ergonomic con - straints posed by human physiology on performing the touch action . HYPOTHESES Our study investigates the ergonomics of approaching a touch point with different ﬁnger orientations and is guided by the following three hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) : Even though users often use their non - dominant hand , e . g . in encumbered situations , users perceive touch actions performed with their dominant HAND as more feasible . Users prefer operating devices with their dominant hand , and we expected this inﬂuence our results . Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) : Changes in ﬁnger PITCH 3 would affect feasibility RATING s . We decided to explore this hypothesis as past work provided little evidence on how pitch values affected input feasibility . Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) : The more the ﬁnger YAW 4 would diverge from the direction parallel to the user’s arm , the lower the feasibility RATING would be . We noted that increased twist in the wrist was expected to decrease feasibility . While verifying 3 In this paper , we deﬁne PITCH as the angle between the ﬁnger and the horizontal touch surface . PITCH is 0 ◦ when the ﬁnger is parallel to the touch surface , i . e . the entire ﬁnger touches the surface . 4 In this paper , we deﬁne YAW as the angle between the ﬁnger and a mid - axis parallel the longer edge of the phone ( when in horizontal mode ) . YAW is 0 ◦ when the ﬁnger is parallel to the long edge of the phone and increases when the ﬁnger is rotated counterclockwise . Figure 2 . The study apparatus with the 3D printed 55 ◦ pitch stabilizer and the 16 yaw positions drawn on the touch surface . this hypothesis , we endeavored to identify how much twist was allowed while still producing a feasibility RATING suitable for designing interaction techniques . METHOD In our study , we systematically manipulated the ﬁnger pitch and yaw while performing a touch action . To study our three hypotheses , we conducted the study in a controlled environ - ment with a number of constraints to ensure the validity of the study . Our goal was to observe the touch action as an atomic task . Therefore , we artiﬁcially restricted the participants’ ﬁn - ger posture to prevent them from subconsciously adjusting their hand , which would result in a larger input range . More - over , movements of the participant’s body would have caused a larger input range . Therefore , participants were not allowed to move either the apparatus or their chair . To investigate the effect of ﬁnger orientation on the feasibility of a touch action , as an atomic task we explore the full poten - tial input range . We used 4 pitch angles and 16 yaw angles , each with a step size of 22 . 5 ◦ . Study Design In a repeated measures experiment , we asked participants to perform touch actions with their index ﬁnger . We asked them to rate the feasibility of the touch action resulting in the depen - dent variable RATING . Feasibility , in this context , was deﬁned as the effort required to perform the touch action . The experi - ment was conducted with three independent variables : PITCH and YAW of the index ﬁnger , as well as HAND . We used 10 ◦ , 32 . 5 ◦ , 55 ◦ , and 77 . 5 ◦ for PITCH . We did not investigate angles steeper than 77 . 5 ◦ , due to ﬁndings by Xiao et al . [ 28 ] who stated that a pitch of 90 ◦ cannot be detected and performed with long nails . For YAW , we covered the full 360 ◦ range resulting in 0 . 0 ◦ to 337 . 5 ◦ with 22 . 5 ◦ steps . All combina - tions were tested with the index ﬁnger of the right and the left Figure 3 . The four pitch stabilizers we used in the study to limit PITCH to 77 . 5 ◦ , 55 ◦ , 32 . 5 ◦ and 10 ◦ presented from left to right . HAND . Thus , we used a PITCH × YAW × HAND = 4 × 16 × 2 study design resulting in 128 conditions . Apparatus Our apparatus design aimed to maximize the control over the independent variables . Xiao et al . [ 28 ] stated that it is difﬁcult to reliably ensure that participants can touch a screen with a particular pitch . In their study , Xiao et al . used laser - cut plastic wedges to align the ﬁnger at a particular pitch . The wedges , however , were removed during the recording process , which inﬂuenced the accuracy . To ensure that participants perform the touch actions with a particular pitch , we used 3D - printed pitch stabilizers . We manufactured pitch stabilizers with a PITCH of 10 ◦ , 32 . 5 ◦ , 55 ◦ , and 77 . 5 ◦ as presented in Figure 3 . Participants had to place the ﬁnger on the pitch stabilizer while performing a touch action . The four pitch stabilizers ensured that participants performed a touch action with a given pitch . Further , the pitch stabilizers ensured that participants did not vary the roll of the ﬁnger during touch acquisition . We used a touch - sensitive sensor by Synaptics , to ensure that the participants touched the surface . The touch layer was surrounded by a white plastic frame to level the area around the touch layer ( see Figure 2 ) . This resulted in a ﬂat surface that enabled secure positioning the pitch stabilizer on the sensor . We marked the center of the touch sensor with a permanent marker . We further marked the 16 input yaw angles with a line on the surface and wrote the angle next to the line ( see Figure 4 ) . The touch sensor was ﬁxed on a desk to ensure that participants could not move it . We employed a tablet to guide participants through the study . During the study , an application running on the tablet showed the hand , the pitch , and the yaw that should be used for the next trial . The application randomized the order of yaw and pitch . Participants were asked to rate the feasibility of the performed touch action with a slider control on a scale with 100 steps from ’ easy ’ to ’ hard ’ . Using continuous rating scales that have a long history in psychophysical measurement and enables a robust evaluation [ 22 ] . Further , we choose a slider with no ticks as Matejka et al . [ 18 ] showed that ticks inﬂuence the distribution of the results . Additionally , the application gave the opportunity to tick a checkbox indicating that the input was not feasible . The checkbox enabled distinguishing between very hard but possible and physically impossible touch actions . Figure 4 . The apparatus we used in our study , showing the tablet , the touch layer and one of the pitch stabilizer while one participant touches the touch surface . Participants We recruited participants from an internal university self - volunteer pool . We invited all the volunteers to participate in the study . Of the volunteers , 9 female and 10 male partici - pants agreed to take part in the study . These participants were between 22 and 44 years old ( M = 25 . 9 , SD = 2 . 7 ) . Of all participants 16 participants were right - handed , 3 left - handed and none of the participants were ambidextrous . One of the right - handed participants did not follow the procedure of the study . Therefore , we discarded the data collected from this participant . Procedure After welcoming the participants , we explained the purpose and the procedure of the study . Afterwards , we asked them to ﬁll a consent form and a demographics questionnaire . The participants were seated on a chair in front of the desk with the apparatus . The chair was aligned with the center of the apparatus . We ﬁxed the position of the chair and asked par - ticipants to neither move the chair nor the touch layer of the apparatus during the study . We further explained to them how to place and use the pitch stabilizer . After the participants felt comfortable using the apparatus , we explained how to use the rating scale and the tick box , that is if they could not perform the touch action they should tick the box . Further , we explained that they should rate the effort required to perform the touch action and then explained the labels on the scale in detail . We explicitly mentioned that easy meant that little to no effort was required to perform that touch action whereas hard described an action that was near impossible to complete . Next , we started the main part of the study . The tablet showed PITCH , YAW , and HAND that should be performed next . Partic - ipants were asked to perform the touch action in the center of the sensor ( the center was marked as shown in Figure 2 ) three times using the given PITCH , YAW and HAND . We asked the participants to slide the ﬁnger in the guiding rail provided by the stabilizer . At the end of each condition , participants had to provide a feasibility RATING on the slider control on the tablet . Participants ﬁrst performed the touch actions using all combi - nations of PITCH and YAW with one hand followed by the other hand , with the order of HAND being counter - balanced . Within HAND , the PITCH condition was randomized , and within the PITCH condition , the YAW condition was randomized to avoid 180° 225° 270° 315° 0° 45° 90° 135° Yaw 20 40 60 80 100 Pitch 10 . 0° Pitch 32 . 5° Pitch 55 . 0° Pitch 77 . 5° ( a ) Left hand rating 180° 225° 270° 315° 0° 45° 90° 135° Yaw 20 40 60 80 100 Pitch 10 . 0° Pitch 32 . 5° Pitch 55 . 0° Pitch 77 . 5° ( b ) Right hand rating Figure 5 .

After the par - ticipants had performed all conditions , we thanked them for their volunteer participation . RESULTS We collected 2304 ratings from 18 participants . Out of the 2304 rated conditions , 485 ( 21 . 1 % ) were marked by the participants as not feasible to perform . All inputs that the participants marked to be not feasible where considered to be hard ( 100 points ) for the analysis . We applied the Aligned Rank Transform ( ART ) [ 25 ] procedure to the feasible RATING s , using the ARTool toolkit 5 to align and rank our data . We conducted a three - way ANOVA to determine whether the independent variables signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the perceived feasibility of performing the touch action . Our analysis re - vealed signiﬁcant main effects for PITCH , YAW , and HAND on feasibility ( F ( 3 , 2176 ) = 5 . 413 , p < . 005 ; F ( 15 , 2176 ) = 196 . 194 , p < . 001 . ; F ( 1 , 2176 ) = 22 . 701 , p < . 001 , respectively ) . Fur - ther , we found signiﬁcant two - way interactions between PITCH × HAND and YAW × HAND ( F ( 3 , 2176 ) = 3 . 027 , p = . 028 ; F ( 15 , 2176 ) = 147 . 566 , p < . 001 , respectively ) . However , there was no signiﬁcant two - way interaction between PITCH × YAW ( F ( 45 , 2176 ) = 1 . 179 , p = . 194 ) . Lastly , we found a signiﬁ - cant three - way interaction between PITCH , YAW , and HAND ( F ( 45 , 2176 ) = 2 . 361 , p < . 001 ) . Figure 5 presents the distri - bution of feasibility RATING s for all YAW s and both HAND s . Consequently , we employed further comparisons to investigate how the different variables inﬂuenced the results . 5 http : / / depts . washington . edu / madlab / proj / art / index . html last accessed : 05 - 17 - 2017 Zone HAND df F p comfort right 3 , 428 9 . 385 < . 001 comfort left 3 , 428 9 . 436 < . 001 non - comfort right 3 , 716 9 . 539 < . 001 non - comfort left 3 , 716 6 . 049 < . 001 Table 1 .

The blue line indi - cates the threshold between comfort and non - comfort zones . We calculated a Sine regression to predict the RATING based on YAW . We found a regression equation with R 2 = . 991 for the right index ﬁnger and R 2 = . 978 for the left index ﬁnger . The predicted RATING is equal to RATING = 54 . 8 − 44 . 5 sin ( YAW + 0 . 9 ) for the right hand and RATING = 58 . 4 − 43 . 1 sin ( YAW + 0 . 8 ) for the left hand with YAW in radians , see Figure 6 . Next , we investigated which YAW angles produced touch ac - tions that are perceived as impossible to perform . For the right index ﬁnger , the participants stated 244 out of 1152 ( 21 . 2 % ) times that touch was not feasible using the given orientation and 241 out of 1152 ( 20 . 9 % ) times for the left index ﬁnger . For the right hand , 99 . 18 % of trials that were perceived to be impossible fell into the range from 112 . 5 ◦ to 315 . 0 ◦ . In the case of the left hand , 100 % of the impossible trials were re - ported in the range from 45 . 0 ◦ to 247 . 5 ◦ . Considering that the RATING is harder to perform in some input zones , we deﬁned a threshold of 40 to mark the range where the trail was rated as impossible from the rest , as explained next . Consequently , we observed that the YAW space could be divided into two zones , which we named the comfort and non - comfort zones , as shown in Figure 7 . Further , we noted that for the right HAND , the comfort zone ( M = 51 . 89 , SD = 36 . 65 ) was rated signiﬁcantly different from the non - comfort zone ( M = 62 . 95 , SD = 36 . 29 ) by conducting a Welch Two Sample t - test ( t ( 900 . 61 ) = − 4 . 98 , p < . 001 ) . This was conﬁrmed for the left hand ( comfort zone : M = 45 . 04 , SD = 36 . 69 ; non - comfort zone : M = 60 . 92 , SD = 38 . 91 ) as well ( t ( 949 . 77 ) = − 6 . 954 , p < . 001 ) .

The bars represent how often a yaw angle was rated as not feasible to perform . fore , we choose the threshold of 40 for the RATING to divide the two zones . The comfort zone for the right HAND ranges from 326 . 25 ◦ to 101 . 25 ◦ and the comfort zone for the left HAND ranges from 258 . 75 ◦ to 33 . 75 ◦ . Therefore the span of both comfort zones is equal to 135 . 0 ◦ for both hands and two comfort zones overlap by 67 . 5 ◦ Thus the non - comfort zones are 225 . 0 ◦ wide . We used four one - way repeated measures ANOVAs to in - vestigate whether PITCH signiﬁcantly affected the feasibility RATING in the two zones and HAND . As Table 1 shows , we found signiﬁcant effects ; the ratings are presented in Figure 5 . Further , we did the same for YAW ; and results are presented in Table 2 . Left - handed Participants We also analyzed the data produced by the 3 left - handed par - ticipants . We collected 384 ratings from 3 left - handed par - ticipants . Out of the 384 ratings , 50 ( 13 . 0 % ) were rated not feasible . Figure 8 compares the average RATING for all YAW conditions between left - and right - handed participants . The data suggests that left - handed participants reported R ATING similar to right - handed participants . Thus this indicates that the ﬁndings are valid irrespective of the dominant hand . DISCUSSION Our results show that ﬁnger orientation has a signiﬁcant effect on perceived feasibility of touch actions . As expected , partici - pants perceived actions performed with the dominant HAND as more feasible than those performed with the non - dominant hand . Thus , the result of the initial three - way ANOVA con - ﬁrms H1 . Our analysis revealed a signiﬁcant effect of PITCH on the feasi - bility RATING . This indicates that the feasibility of performing touch actions is inﬂuenced by ﬁnger PITCH conﬁrming H2 . This is in contrast to Wang and Ren [ 24 ] who found no differ - ence in accuracy between vertical and oblique touch . Further - more , the results indicate that ﬂat angles are preferred when touching in the comfort zone while steep angles are overall rated to be easier when operating in the non - comfort zones . 180° 225° 270° 315° 0° 45° 90° 135° Yaw 20 40 60 80 100 Left hand - left - handed Left hand - right - handed Right hand - left - handed Right hand - right - handed Figure 8 . Comparison of HAND in respect to the handedness of the par - ticipants , showing the average value per YAW . Owing to a signiﬁcant requirement to twist the ﬁnger , higher ratings in comfort zone to otherwise are understandable . Further , our analysis revealed a signiﬁcant effect of YAW on the feasibility RATING . In particular , we found that the dis - tribution of RATING s can be approximated by a sine curve . This shows that the perceived feasibility of the touch action increases steeply while the ﬁnger diverts from the parallel - to - arm direction . We also observed that most YAW values could render the touch action impossible ( as evidenced by the exis - tence of comfort and non - comfort zones ) . Consequently , the range within which yaw input is feasible is highly restricted and a larger YAW results in decreased feasibility RATINGS which conﬁrms H3 . Design Considerations Here , we chart how our ﬁndings inﬂuence the design of future single - ﬁnger input techniques for interactive surfaces in the form of ﬁve design considerations . Avoid entering the non - comfort yaw zone The non - comfort zones cover 225 ◦ out of 360 ◦ of the possible input space for both hands and are therefore much larger than the comfort zones . The comfort and the non - comfort zones signiﬁcantly differ in perceived feasibility when touching a surface with different ﬁnger orientations . Consequently , future designs of input techniques should not require the user to use orientations that fall into the non - comfort zones . Requiring input in the non - comfort zone creates a possibility for the task to be perceived as impossible . Thus , tasks like widgets that require rotating with a single ﬁnger should be avoided at all costs . Range for effective yaw input depends on the hand While many interactive surfaces can detect from which angle the user’s hand is approaching , future designs must take that into account while designing yaw gestures . The yaw rotation possibilities depend on the hand used . If the interactive surface cannot detect which hand is being used , yaw gestures should be limited to the 45 ◦ - wide overlap in the comfort zones of the left and right hands to ensure that the gesture is feasible to perform with both hands . Make use of pitch - based techniques for contextual features We have shown that touch at different pitch angles is perceived as varying in feasibility . Previous work reported inﬂuence on accuracy . In contrast to yaw , the range of feasible pitch input is the same for the left and the right hand . This suggests that there is a design space for designing interactions based on ﬁnger pitch for interactive surfaces . Similarly to touch pressure techniques ( e . g . Apple’s 3D Touch ) , ﬁnger pitch could be used to activate additional functions such as contextual menus . Make use of pitch - based techniques for modal interaction As different pitch angles can be perceived and differentiated well , interacting at different ﬁnger pitch angles also affords different modes in touch - based reading devices like ebook readers and tablets . For example , pitch based techniques could offer an alternative mode ( to time or pressure ) when one needs to parse complex textual data . Most common techniques for parsing text include note - taking [ 8 ] , annotating [ 9 ] , and in - sight generation from these notes as a solo or collaborative activity [ 7 ] . Varying the pitch angles can activate the mode to highlight text , or annotate it with notes . Use edges of the comfort zone for safety - critical input Our results show that the perceived feasibility rating rises as the ﬁnger divert from the parallel - to - arm direction . Future designs could exploit this observation by using higher yaw angles for sensitive input . For example , when conﬁrmation to restore factory settings is required , the user could be asked to perform a 67 . 5 ◦ yaw rotation . While the task would still fall in the comfort zone ( and thus be feasible ) , it would require more effort than a single tap thus limiting possible slips . A combination of pitch and yaw can also be used to offer a second dimension to afford sharing or disclosure . For example , sharing digital notes has been shown to improve performance in critical tasks [ 6 , 27 ] . Setting the mode for digital notes to be private or transparent for public consumption could be done by varying pitch ( simultaneously or in succession ) with an angular yaw movement . Further work is required to address the opportunities and limitations resulting from this approach . Explore the beneﬁts of pitch when unsure about yaw Our results show a potential for future designs to use pitch input when yaw values may fall outside of the comfort zone . This may be the case when multiple users use a single touch device e . g . when collaboratively browsing photos on a tablet lying on a table . Further , yaw is often limited when users are likely to use one - handed input e . g . while shopping . Given that appropriate sensing is available , pitch input may enable effective two - dimensional navigation even when the ﬁnger approaches the touch surface at a yaw angle outside of the comfort zone . Consequently , we suggest enabling pitch - based navigation in scenarios when yaw - based techniques are possi - bly restricted . Limitations The study used a highly controlled setting , which ensured that neither the participant nor the device was moved . Thus , our results can be directly applied in interactions only to stationary devices . Allowing the user to move the device or allowing the user to move around the device would increase the range of feasible inputs , but would increase the complexity of the interaction and the time required to interact . We , therefore , believe that it is advisable that users should not be required to interact in the non - comfort zone . However , as this paper is a ﬁrst attempt to investigate the feasibility of a single touch action with varies pitch and yaw , the aim was to investigate the core limitations of using pitch and yaw as an input dimension . Our study mainly focused on right - handed participants . A larger number of left - handed participants would be required for conducting statistical analysis of data from left - handed users . However , we assume that the comfort zone is similar for left - and for right - handed users . This is supported by the results of the three left - handed participants . While we cannot be certain that there are no differences , the similarity between left - and right - handed participants suggests that potential differences are small . Our investigation is limited to pitch and yaw angles . We explic - itly limited roll variation by using pitch stabilizers . Existing interaction techniques already use roll as an input source . For instance , in Apple’s iOS , it is possible to roll the ﬁnger for precise text cursor manipulation . Fat thumb interaction by Boring et al . [ 2 ] used the pitch and the roll of the ﬁnger for pan and zoom operations . While the roll range is highly limited by the arm’s kinematic chain , it still requires further investigation . CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK We conducted a study to investigate the ergonomics of ﬁn - ger pitch and yaw as an additional touch input parameter . We asked participants to rate the perceived feasibility of per - forming touch actions with different ﬁnger orientations . We systematically manipulated the ﬁnger pitch and yaw while per - forming a touch action . We varied the input orientations using 4 different pitch and 16 different yaw angles . All combinations were performed with the index ﬁnger of the left and the right hand . The results show that not all orientations are equally feasible , with some orientations being infeasible to perform . Furthermore , we show that the input space for each hand can be divided into two zones ; the comfort and non - comfort zones . Only 135 ◦ out of 360 ◦ of all yaw orientations are within the comfort zone and perceived as feasible . Based on our results we contribute six design considerations . In this paper , device and participants remained at ﬁxed posi - tions which enabled us to identify the boundaries of human ability to perform pitch and yaw touch actions . While we investigated a static scenario , future work needs to explore the feasibility of different ﬁnger orientations when the device is held in the hands . This can be accomplished with smartphones which can track the hand while interacting with the smart - phone , e . g . [ 15 ] . Furthermore , we are interested in further investigating potential differences between left - handed and right - handed users . In future work , we will aim to design new interaction techniques that make efﬁcient use of pitch and yaw gestures . We hope that the considerations presented in this paper will inspire further developments in creating enhanced single - ﬁnger touch input interaction patterns .
