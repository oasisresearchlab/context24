However , a large - scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences , social sciences , and humanities re - veals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain . For instance , even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders , close inspection reveals that , in certain ﬁelds , men predominate in the prestigious ﬁrst and last author positions . Moreover , women are signiﬁcantly underrepresented as authors of single - authored papers . Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can appear in scholarly authorship . I . INTRODUCTION Gender inequities and gender biases persist in higher education . After decades of high female enrollment in most PhD ﬁelds , women represent one - quarter of full pro - fessors and earn on average 80 % of the salary of men in comparable positions ( West and Curtis , 2006 ) . A recent report ( National Research Council , 2010 ) surveyed 1800 faculty across six science and engineering disciplines and found men publish signiﬁcantly more in chemistry and mathematics , while women publish more in electrical en - gineering ( there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences found in biology , civil engineering , and physics ) . A recent exper - iment tested the role of gender in hiring by asking 127 science faculty to evaluate potential lab manager applica - tions and found faculty gave identical applications higher scores if the applicant had a male name ( Moss - Racusin et al . , 2012 ) . Another recent analysis of commissioned articles in two prestigious journals published in 2010 and 2011 showed that women scientists are underrepresented ; for instance , women wrote just 3 . 8 % of earth and en - vironmental sciences articles for Nature News & Views , although they represent 20 % of the scientists in this dis - cipline ( Conley and Stadmark , 2012 ) . With the use of al - phabetical authorship listings declining over time ( Walt - man , 2012 ) , and given the complexity of evaluating intel - lectual contributions ( Zuckerman , 1968 ) in increasingly collaborative eﬀorts , understanding patterns of author - ship order becomes increasingly important . Here we use the JSTOR corpus — a body of academic papers from a range of scholarly disciplines spanning ﬁve centuries — to examine trends in the gender composition of academic authorship through time . We pay particu - lar attention to authorship order , given that ﬁrst and sometimes last author publications are at least as im - portant as raw publication counts for hiring , promotion , and tenure , particularly in scientiﬁc ﬁelds ( Wren et al . , 2007 ) . Studies of authorship in the medical literature reveal , for instance , that women have been historically underrepresented in the prestige positions of ﬁrst and last author , and that while discrepancies have recently declined in the ﬁrst author position , women remain un - derrepresented as last authors ( Dotson , 2011 ; Feramisco et al . , 2009 ; Jagsi et al . , 2006 ; Sidhu et al . , 2009 ) . To view authorship patterns in their disciplinarily context , we use a network - based community detection approach to categorize hierarchically each paper in our study cor - pus . This yields a hierarchical classiﬁcation of all papers in our study and allows us to study and compare pat - terns of gender representation in individual ﬁelds of any size and scale . II . METHODS The JSTOR corpus The JSTOR corpus ( http : / / www . jstor . org ) is a digital archive of published scholarly research that spans the sci - ences and humanities from 1545 to the present day . At the time of this analysis , the JSTOR corpus comprised 8 . 3 million documents ranging from 1545 until early 2011 , including 4 . 2 million research articles . Approximately 1 . 8 million of these documents ( 97 % of which are research ar - ticles ) cite or are cited by other documents in the JSTOR corpus and thus are amenable to network analysis . We call this group the “JSTOR network dataset” . Moreover 94 % of these 1 . 8 million articles are part of a single gi - ant component of the citation network , such that any of these articles can be reached from any other by following citation trails forwards and backwards . We restrict our analysis to the JSTOR network dataset because this is the portion of the JSTOR corpus that we can hierarchi - cally categorize using citation information . For a list of the main ﬁelds available in JSTOR dataset , see Table II . The gender composition of the identiﬁed authors in the network dataset ( 21 . 9 % female ) is close to that of the identiﬁed authors in the entire corpus ( 20 . 8 % percent ) . a r X i v : 1 211 . 1759v1 [ phy s i c s . s o c - ph ] 8 N ov 2012 2 Mapping the hierarchical structure of scholarly research The scientiﬁc literature can be viewed as a large net - work in which papers are linked by citation relation - ships ( de Solla Price , 1965 ) . The topology of scientiﬁc networks can be used to map the structure of science , and the map equation ( Rosvall et al . , 2010 ; Rosvall and Bergstrom , 2008 ) has proven to be a particularly eﬀective method ( Lancichinetti and Fortunato , 2009 ) . However , such maps of science have typically shown only a single layer of structure . To map the structure of scholarly dis - ciplines , ﬁelds and subﬁelds , we turn to the hierarchical map equation ( Rosvall and Bergstrom , 2011 ) , which re - veals multiple levels of substructure within a network . Using the hierarchical map equation on the network of citations , we create a multi - scale map of the JSTOR net - work dataset in the form of a hierarchical classiﬁcation that assigns each paper to a major domain , ﬁeld , sub - ﬁeld , speciality within subﬁeld , and so forth . For exam - ple , Bill Hamillton’s classic 1980 paper “Sex versus asex versus parasite” is classiﬁed as residing in Ecology and evolution : Population genetics : Sexual and asexual re - production : Sex and virulence . We used the May 13th , 2012 version of the hierarchical map equation code ; im - provements to that search algorithm made subsequent to our analysis may ﬁnd somewhat ﬂatter hierarchies than that reported here . While the algorithm made the deci - sions about how many ﬁelds exist and which papers are assigned to which ﬁelds , we manually assigned descrip - tive names to each ﬁeld or subﬁeld to facilitate naviga - tion . The names are intended as a general indication of subject matter rather than as a deﬁnitive classiﬁcation . Determining gender of authors We use US Social Security Administration records to determine gender from ﬁrst names . The US Social Security Administration website ( http : / / www . ssa . gov / oact / babynames / ) makes available the top 1000 names annually for each of the 153 million boys and 143 million girls born from 1880 – 2010 . ( These data acknowledge only two genders . ) We assume we can identify an author’s gender if the author’s ﬁrst name is associated with a single gender in social security records at least 95 % of the time , as with ‘Mary’ , or ‘John’ . Otherwise , as with ‘Leslie’ or ‘Sidney’ , we are unable to identify the gender and do not include that author in our analysis . Since in any given era , androgynous names are more likely to be females , this may slightly downwardly bias our estimates of women ( Lieberson et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , we are unable to classify names that never appear in the top 1000 for either gender in the US records . As a result , authors of some nationalities may be underrepresented in our data set . In a few rare cases national diﬀerences may cause misleading assignments for non - US authors ( e . g . ‘Andrea’ is typically a female name in the US but a male name in Italy ) . By this method we are able to assign genders to 6879 unique ﬁrst names : 3809 female and 3070 male . We extracted the ﬁrst names of all authors in the JS - TOR network dataset , discarding those authors who list only initials . An instance of authorship consists of a per - son and a paper for which the person is designated as a co - author . There are 3 . 6 million authorships in the JS - TOR network dataset ; of these we are able to extract a full ﬁrst name for 2 . 8 million authorships ( 77 % ) associ - ated with 1 . 5 million papers 1 . Of these 2 . 8 million au - thorships with full ﬁrst names , we are able to conﬁdently assign gender to 73 . 3 % . The remaining authorships in - volve names not in the US social security top 1000 lists ( 24 . 3 % ) , or names associated with both genders ( 2 . 4 % ) . The ﬁnal data analyzed include all papers where we know the gender of one or more authors . Gender and authorship order We look at the gender composition of all papers with any number of authors in the JSTOR network dataset . For every ﬁeld , subﬁeld , and so - forth , we calculate both the overall gender composition and the gender compo - sition of each authorship position—ﬁrst , second , third , etc . In some ﬁelds , such as molecular biology , the last author position of a paper conveys a special meaning : the last author is typically the principal investigator or group leader of multi - author eﬀort . This is especially the case for papers with at least three authors . Therefore we also report the gender frequency in the last - author po - sition for all papers with three or more co - authors . We then compare the gender frequencies at each author po - sition with the overall gender frequency in the same ﬁeld . If authorship order were gender - unbiased , we would ex - pect to see the ﬁeld - wide gender composition reﬂected at each author position . III . RESULTS Authorship and author order In an interactive online visualization at http : / / www . eigenfactor . org / gender / , we report the gender composition by authorship position and overall , for each ﬁeld , subﬁeld , etc . , of the JSTOR network dataset . Women represent 21 . 9 % of the gender - identiﬁed authorships in the entire JSTOR network dataset , but these authorships are not distributed evenly in time across ﬁelds , or across authorship positions . For instance , women represent 17 % of total single - authored 1 The exclusion of authors with only ﬁrst initials may exclude women authors disproportionately , particularly in early eras when women may have been more likely than men to publish with initials to avoid potential discrimination . 3 0 100000 200000 300000 400000 500000 600000 A u t ho r s h i p s (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:230) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:224) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) (cid:236) 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 F r ac ti on w o m e n FIG . 1 Authorships and gender composition in the JSTOR network dataset , by decade .

Figure 1 shows that the fraction of female authorships in general has increased substantially since the 1960s . However , some of this increase may result from increased ease of identifying woman authors as individuals become more likely to use ﬁrst name instead of merely initials . Studies of the economics literature have noted consid - erable diﬀerences in gender representation in subﬁelds ( Boschini and Sj¨ogren , 2007 ; Dolado et al . , 2005 ) , and our analysis reveals a comparable pattern across the sub - ﬁelds within the JSTOR network dataset . Even within a ﬁeld such as sociology that has a relatively even gen - der balance , diﬀerent subﬁelds can vary dramatically in gender composition , as illustrated in Figure 3 . Women are not evenly represented across author posi - tions . Prior to 1990 , women were signiﬁcantly underrep - resented in the ﬁrst author position ; subsequent to 1990 much of this gap has been closed . However , a new gender gap has emerged in the last author position — a position of prestige in the biosciences which represent more than half of the authorships in the JSTOR network dataset ( Figure 4 ) . Authorship order patterns vary among ﬁelds as well ( Figure 5 ) . And because conventions of author order vary across disciplines ( Endersby , 1996 ; Waltman , 2012 ) , underrepresentation of women in the last author position does not hold up in all ﬁelds . In mathemat - ics , for instance , author order tends to be alphabetical irrespective of contribution , and in this ﬁeld women are evenly represented—albeit at low frequency—across au - thorship positions . As expected ( Wuchty et al . , 2007 ) , the proportion of multi - authored papers has increased over time ( Figure 2 ) . Some of the pattern in authorship order may be an 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 Y P A 1 2 3 4 5 FIG . 2 Distribution of author number over time for the JS - TOR corpus .

IV . DISCUSSION Only a century ago , women were forbidden from seek - ing degrees in most universities in Europe ( Etzkowitz et al . , 2000 ) . Women seeking a role in academia faced — and continue to face — diﬃculties at every stage , from admission ( Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge was the last all - male college to become mixed , which occurred in 1988 ) , to post - doctoral fel - 4 FIG . 4 Gender as a function of authorship order across the entire JSTOR network dataset .

Last author percentage is for papers with at least three authors . FIG . 5 Gender as a function of authorship position in three domains of scholarship from 1990 to present : cell and molec - ular biology ( 276 , 992 authorships ) , sociology ( 44 , 895 author - ships ) , and mathematics ( 6 , 134 authorships ) . In molecular biology , women are overrepresented as ﬁrst author but under - represented at the last author position . In sociology , women are underrepresented in both ﬁrst and last author positions . In mathematics , where the convention is for alphabetical au - thor order ( Waltman , 2012 ) , women are neither under - nor over - represented at ﬁrst or last author positions . lowships ( Wenneras and Wold , 1997 ) , to hiring ( Moss - Racusin et al . , 2012 ) , to tenure ( Spelke and Grace , 2006 ) . As both women and the belief that they belong in uni - versities have inﬁltrated the academic system , the situa - tion has greatly improved . Women have earned a higher proportion of bachelor’s degrees than men since the mid 1980s ( England and Li , 2006 ) . In 2004 , 48 % of PhD re - cipients were women , up from 16 % in 1972 ( West and Curtis , 2006 ) . Despite this increasing equity early in the pipeline , women are still signiﬁcantly underrepresented in tenure - track and research university faculty positions . Women occupy only 39 % of full - time faculty positions and make up an even lower percentage of full professors ( West and Curtis , 2006 ) . Since academic publishing is very important to be - ing hired as a faculty member and being promoted , the under - representation of women as authors in academic publications and in more prestigious authorship positions aﬀects the representation of women faculty in academia . 5 Field % female authorships Mathematics 10 . 64 6134 Philosophy 12 . 04 12190 Economics 13 . 68 69142 Probability and Statistics 18 . 11 28324 Political science - international 19 . 07 14908 Political science - US domestic 19 . 09 15705 Ecology and evolution 22 . 76 279012 Law 24 . 21 18503 Organizational and marketing 25 . 44 32119 Physical anthropology 27 . 05 16296 Radiation damage 27 . 69 7825 Classical studies 28 . 88 6372 Molecular & Cell biology 29 . 25 277032 History 30 . 47 15585 Veterinary medicine 31 . 81 10960 Cognitive science 32 . 12 12786 Anthropology 36 . 46 19900 Pollution and occupational health 37 . 57 32108 Sociology 41 . 41 44895 Demography 41 . 90 7600 Education 46 . 35 28635 TABLE II Gender composition from 1990 - 2011 for disciplines ( i . e . , groups at the ﬁrst level of hierarchical clustering ) with at least 5 , 000 authorships . Our research shows that women are increasingly repre - sented in JSTOR network dataset authorships : 27 . 2 % of authorships from 1990 - 2012 are women compared to just 15 . 1 % from 1665 – 1989 . However , our results also show that the academic publishing environment remains inequitable . For instance , since 1990 , women repre - sent only 26 % of single - authored papers in the JSTOR dataset . In many ﬁelds , it is not just sheer number of publica - tions , but author order that matters in promotion and tenure decisions . Here we show that women have tra - ditionally been underrepresented in the ﬁrst author po - sition , though this is changing , and women remain un - derrepresented in the last author position 2 . We should expect some lag between disparity in the ﬁrst and last author positions , as it takes time for younger scholars to become leaders of research groups . But the diﬀerence be - tween total female authorships and ﬁrst authorships has been less than 2 % since the 1960s , while the discrepancy between total and last authorships remains above 5 % . While our analysis can clearly delineate gendered pat - terns in authorship , the data do not allow us to uncover mechanisms that produce the gender disparities we ﬁnd . One possibility is that women submit fewer papers than men or that their contributions to papers are less signif - icant than their male coauthors , thereby landing them 2 Given these ﬁndings , we note the irony of our own authorship order on the present paper . in lower prestige positions on papers . While there is no evidence to support the claim of women’s lesser contri - butions , women are less likely to be involved with collab - orative research projects in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds ( Fox , 2001 ) . A second possibility is that in informal negoti - ation among a team of authors about author position order , men negotiate more forcefully for the more presti - gious positions . While we know of no studies that specif - ically examine authorship negotiations , men , in general , do negotiate more than women ( Babcock and Laschever , 2007 ) and are more likely to self - promote their accom - plishments ( Rudman , 1998 ) . A third possibility is that there is a bias against women in the review process , such that when they are in the more prestigious author po - sitions , papers of equal quality are less likely to be ac - cepted than when men occupy the prestigious positions . This would produce an underrepresentation of women in journals that do not rely on gender blind reviews . While some have claimed , using correlational data , that gender bias is no longer a factor in producing gender dispari - ties in academia ( Ceci and Williams , 2011 ) , controlled laboratory experiments and ﬁeld experiments continue to ﬁnd that biases negatively aﬀect judgments of women ( Correll et al . , 2007 ; Goldin and Rouse , 2000 ) . For exam - ple , a female applicant for science lab manager positions was less likely to be hired than an otherwise identical male applicant , based on judgments of competence by prospective hiring faculty ( Moss - Racusin et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , the report “Beyond Bias and Barriers” re - viewed the large literature on gender , bias and academic careers and concluded that subtle biases continue to af - fect women’s careers in academia ( National Academy of Sciences , 2007 ) . Our analysis reveals several important patterns : while there have been important gains in parity in the ﬁrst author position , with the proportion of women in ﬁrst author positions now even slightly exceeding the over - all proportion of female authorships , the proportion of women in the last author position and the proportion authoring overall remain disproportionately low . One strength of this study is that the large dataset represents a signiﬁcant number of all academics , women and men , across many ﬁelds of study and over a large timespan . Though signiﬁcant progress has been made toward gen - der equality , important diﬀerences in positions of intel - lectual authorship draw our attention to the subtle ways gender disparities continue to exist . The ﬁnding under - scores that we cannot yet disregard gender disparity as a notable characteristic of academia . 6 References Babcock , L . , and S .
