In zebrafish , loss - of - function mutations in moe result in defects in brain ventricle formation , retinal pigmented epithelium and neural retinal development , pericardial edema , and tail curvature . In humans and mice , there are two major alternately spliced isoforms of the Moe orthologue , Erythrocyte Protein Band 4 . 1 - Like 5 ( Epb4 . 1l5 ) , which we have named Epb4 . 1l5 long and Epb4 . 1l5 short , that differ after the FERM domain . Interestingly , Moe and both Epb4 . 1l5 isoforms have a putative C ' terminal Type - I PDZ - Binding Domain ( PBD ) . We previously showed that the N ' terminal FERM domain in Moe directly mediates interactions with Crumbs proteins and Nagie oko ( Nok ) in zebrafish , but the function of the C ' terminal half of Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 has not yet been examined . Results : To define functionally important domains in zebrafish Moe and murine Epb4 . 1l5 , we tested whether injection of mRNAs encoding these proteins could rescue defects in zebrafish moe - embryos . Injection of either moe or epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA , but not epb4 . 1l5 short mRNA , could rescue moe - embryonic defects . We also tested whether mRNA encoding C ' terminal truncations of Epb4 . 1l5 long or chimeric constructs with reciprocal swaps of the isoform - specific PBDs could rescue moe - defects . We found that injection of the Epb4 . 1l5 short chimera ( Epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD ) , containing the PBD from Epb4 . 1l5 long , could rescue retinal and RPE defects in moe - mutants , but not brain ventricle formation . Injection of the Epb4 . 1l5 long chimera ( Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD ) , containing the PBD from Epb4 . 1l5 short , rescued retinal defects , and to a large extent rescued RPE integrity . The only construct that caused a dominant phenotype in wild - type embryos , was Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD , which caused brain ventricle defects and edema that were similar to those observed in moe - mutants . Lastly , the morphology of rod photoreceptors in moe - mutants where embryonic defects were rescued by moe or epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injection is abnormal and their outer segments are larger than normal . Conclusion : Taken together , the data reveal tissue specificity for the function of the PBD in Epb4 . 1l5 long , and suggest that additional C ' terminal sequences are important for zebrafish retinal development . Additionally , our data provide further evidence that Moe is a negative regulator of rod outer segment size .

Drosophila Crumbs ( Crb ) and vertebrate Crumbs orthologues are important determi - nants of apical polarity and are critical for epithelial mor - phology [ 1 - 4 ] . The establishment of cell polarity within the developing retinal neuroepithelium is crucial for nor - mal retinal development , as zebrafish with loss - of - func - tion mutations in the polarity determinants aPKC / heart and soul ( has ) , pals1 / mpp5 / nagie oko ( nok ) , crb2a / oko meduzy ( ome ) , and mosaic eyes ( moe ) , fail to properly form cell - specific laminae [ 4 - 9 ] . In addition , ablation of aPKC in differentiating photoreceptors in a conditional knock - out mouse results in a loss of retinal lamination [ 10 ] . Crumbs proteins are also important for normal photore - ceptor morphogenesis and zonula adherens / adherens junction formation and / or maintenance in Drosophila [ 11 - 14 ] . In humans , mutations in the CRUMBS HOMO - LOGUE - 1 ( CRB1 ) gene cause retinal degeneration dis - eases [ 15 - 19 ] . Mouse models lacking functional Crb1 exhibit a compromised outer limiting membrane ( OLM ) in the retina and defects in photoreceptor morphology [ 13 , 14 ] . Furthermore , data from our lab and others have implicated the Crumbs complex as a key regulator of api - cal membrane size in photoreceptors [ 4 , 11 , 12 , 20 , 21 ] . The moe mutant was discovered in a zebrafish mutagene - sis screen , and the moe mutations affect retinal lamina - tion , brain ventricle formation , and heart and body morphology [ 7 , 22 ] . Orthologues have been identified in Drosophila ( Yurt ) and mammals ( Erythrocyte Protein Band 4 . 1 - Like 5 , Epb4 . 1l5 ) [ 22 , 23 ] . The yurt and epb4 . 1l5 locus encode four and two isoforms respectively [ 20 , 24 ] . We and our colleagues have shown that Moe and Moe orthologues form a complex with Crumbs proteins that is mediated by the FERM domain , and this interaction is important for Crumbs protein function [ 20 , 21 ] . The mouse mutant lulu has a null - allele mutation in epb4 . 1l5 , and has defects in the epithelial - mesenchymal transition in cells at the primitive streak and abnormal neural plate morphology that is accompanied by defects in the actin - cytoskeleton [ 24 ] . In this study we use a comparative genomic and proteomic approach to identify functionally important sequences within Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 by testing whether injection of mRNA encoding the long and short isoforms of Epb4 . 1l5 ( Epb4 . 1l5 long and Epb4 . 1l5 short ) can functionally substitute for moe function in zebrafish . We further investigate the role of Moe within different tissues by defining what Epb4 . 1l5 domains are necessary to res - cue distinct moe - defects . Lastly , we report the histological and morphological consequences of losing Epb4 . 1l5 long protein in the rescued zebrafish retina after the depletion of rescue construct . Results Injection of moe mRNA rescues embryonic defects in moe - mutants We tested whether injecting moe mRNA into moe - embryos could rescue embryonic and early larval defects . We found that injection of wild - type moe mRNA into moe - mutant embryos at the 1 – 4 cell - stage rescued brain ventricle for - mation , retinal pigmented epithelial ( RPE ) integrity , and retinal neural epithelial integrity and straightened the tail at 60 hours post fertilization ( hpf ) ( Figure 1 ) . We observed no abnormalities in injected wild - type embryos ( or larvae ) . Pericardial edema in moe - mutants was only partially rescued by moe mRNA injection ( Figure 1D , F , arrow ) . The remaining pericardial edema was a conven - ient marker , however , and made it possible to easily dis - tinguish between wild - type larvae and rescued moe - mutants , but we also confirmed that embryos were moe - mutants by labeling with anti - Moe antibodies at 60 hpf and comparing labeling to wildtypes and uninjected moe - mutants ( Figure 1G , H , I ) . In moe mRNA injected moe - mutants very little anti - Moe labeling was observed except background ( Figure 1I , double arrowheads ) . The weak anti - Moe labeling in moe mRNA injected moe - mutants suggests very little Moe protein encoded by the injected mRNA remains at 60 hpf . We have shown that Moe interacts with Crumbs proteins , which are important apical polarity determinants and that moe loss - of - function results in a failure to localize Crb2a and the junctional protein ZO - 1 at the apical surface of the retina and brain [ 21 , 22 ] . We examined whether injec - tion of moe mRNA into moe - mutants could rescue the api - cal localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO - 1 in the retina and brain . In order to examine Crumbs proteins in zebrafish , we used an antibody we raised against the highly conserved C ' terminal peptide and because this antibody recognizes all zebrafish Crumbs proteins by western blot ( data not shown ) we call this antibody a pan - Crb antibody . In wild - type embryos at 60 hpf , anti - pan - Crb and anti - ZO - 1 labeling localize to the apical / ventricle surface in the brain , and the apical surface and the newly forming outer limiting membrane in the retina ( Figure 1J , M , N ) . In moe - mutants , brain ventricles fail to form prop - erly , and panCrb and ZO - 1 fail to localize to the apical surfaces in the brain and retina ( Figure 1K , O , P ) . Injection of moe mRNA into moe - mutants leads to the apical relo - calization of Crumbs proteins and ZO - 1 in the retina and brain ( Figure 1L , Q , R ) . Conservation between Moe and mouse Epb4 . 1l5 To help identify functionally important domains in the Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 proteins , we first compared their BMC Developmental Biology 2008 , 8 : 3 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 213X / 8 / 3 Page 3 of 15 ( page number not for citation purposes ) sequences ( Figure 2 ) . The mammalian epb4 . 1l5 locus encodes two major splice isoforms that are represented by ESTs in both the human and mouse databases , which we term Epb4 . 1l5 short and Epb4 . 1l5 long . We provide the exon / intron structure of the mouse epb4 . 1l5 locus that has 25 exons : Epb4 . 1l5 short is encoded by exons 1 – 16 and Epb4 . 1l5 long by exons 1 – 15 and 17 – 25 ( Figure 2A ) . We have not found a zebrafish transcript that encodes a pro - tein similar to Epb4 . 1l5 short . A comparison between Moe and mouse Epb4 . 1l5 long shows very strong homology in the FERM domain ( 88 % identity ) , and there is also strong conservation flanking the FERM domain ( 44 amino acids preceding the FERM domain and about 35 amino acids after ) as well as addi - tional islands of strong conservation , notably a class I PDZ - binding domain ( PBD ) at the C ' terminus of both proteins ( Figure 2B ; [ 24 , 25 ] ) . Homology between Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 short ends at amino acid 444 ( Figure 2C , blue arrow ) , after which Epb4 . 1l5 short has 60 unique amino acids ( Figure 2C ) . Epb4 . 1l5 short is predicted to be 56 kDa , and interestingly also has a predicted binding motif for a class I PDZ domain at its C ' terminus ( Figure 2C ) . We raised isoform - specific antibodies against the unique C ' terminal sequences of the long and short isoform of Epb4 . 1l5 and used them for western analysis of mouse tis - sue . We observed two bands that were immunoreactive with Epb4 . 15 long anti - sera . A protein that migrated at approximately 100 kDa was present in eye , brain , heart , lung , kidney , and testis tissue ( Figure 2D ) . There was an additional protein recognized in all tissues at 75 kDa , which is probably non - specific reactivity . Two proteins were detected with anti - Epb4 . 1l5 short affinity - purified antibody . One protein migrated at the expected molecular weight of 56 kDa and was present in brain , liver , lung , kid - ney , pancreas , and gut . A second protein migrating at approximately 75 kDa was broadly expressed .

Functional comparative genomics reveals important domains in Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 To identify functionally important sequences in the Moe and orthologous protein Epb41 . l5 , we tested whether injection of mouse epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA could substitute for moe and rescue moe - mutant defects . We injected epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA into 1 – 4 cell moe - embryos and found that it rescued brain ventricle formation , retinal pig - mented epithelial integrity , and retinal lamination and straightened the tail like injection of moe mRNA ( Table 1 and data not shown ) .

( A - C ) At 30 hpf in wild - type embryos , Moe localizes cortically in brain and retinal neuroepithelial cells and is concentrated at the apical surface ( A ) and ZO - 1 ( green ) and panCrb ( red ) localize to the apical surface of the retina ( B ) and brain ( C ) . ( D - F ) At 30 hpf in moe - embryos , there is no Moe labeling ( D ) and ZO - 1 ( green ) and panCrb ( red ) fail to localize to the apical surface of the retina ( E ) and brain ( F ) . ( G ) At 30 hpf in moe - embryos injected with epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA , Epb4 . 1l5 long immunoreactivity is cortically localized in most retinal and brain neuroepithelial cells and ZO - 1 ( green ) and panCrb ( red ) localize to the apical sur - face in the retina ( H ) and brain ( I ) .

Using antibodies we raised against the unique sequence in Epb4 . 1l5 long , we found that Epb4 . 1l5 long protein in mRNA injected moe - mutants localized cortically like endogenous Moe in wild - type embryos ( Figure 3A , G ) . Because all the proteins shown to interact with Moe do so through its FERM domain [ 21 ] , we tested whether injection of epb4 . 1l5 mRNA encoding a myc - tagged FERM domain ( amino acids 1 – 346 , Epb4 . 1l5 FERM ) could rescue moe - mutant defects like full length moe and epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injec - tion . Injection of epb4 . 1l5 FERM mRNA at the 1 – 4 cell stage failed to rescue the defects in moe - mutants ( data not shown ) and did not lead to apical relocalization of ZO - 1 and anti - panCrb labeling ( Figure 3M , N ) . We also ruled out the possibility that the N ' terminal myc - tag interfered with protein function by showing that Epb4 . 1l5 long myc - tagged at its N ' terminus was still able to rescue moe - mutant defects as well as untagged Epb4 . 1l5 long ( data not shown ) We next tested whether injection of mRNA encoding Epb4 . 1l5 short could rescue moe - mutant defects since it is identical to Epb4 . 1l5 long until amino acid 444 after which there are ~ 60 unique amino acids that end with a pre - dicted PDZ binding domain that is the same class as that in Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 long . Injection of mRNA encoding Epb4 . 1l5 short into moe - mutants at the 1 – 4 cell stage failed to rescue moe - mutant embryonic defects and failed to api - cally relocalize ZO - 1 and anti - panCrb labeling in the ret - ina or brain ( Figure 3K , L ) . Epb4 . 1l5 short labeling with the Epb4 . 1l5 short specific antibodies appears more cytoplas - mic in injected moe - mutants ( Figure 3J ) . Because many proteins with PDZ domains have been implicated in the establishment of cell polarity , we asked whether the PDZ - binding domain in Epb4 . 1l5 long is nec - essary for its function . We injected mRNA constructs encoding Epb4 . 1l5 long with the PBD deleted ( Epb4 . 1l5 long _ Δ PBD ) , Epb4 . 1l5 long where its PBD is replaced by PBD from Epb4 . 1l5 short ( Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD ) and Epb4 . 1l5 short where its PBD is replaced by the PBD from Epb4 . 1l5 long ( Epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD ) . Injection of epb4 . 1l5 long _ PBD mRNA failed to rescue Crb2a and ZO - 1 apical localization in the retina or rescue brain ventricle formation ( Figure 3O , P ) . However , injection of epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD or epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD mRNAs did lead to apical relocaliza - tion of ZO - 1 and anti - panCrb labeling ( Figure 3Q - T ) . We confirmed that protein was expressed from each of the template rescue mRNAs by western analysis of injected zebrafish . Epb4 . 1l5 long and Epb4 . 15 short were not detecta - ble at time points beyond 72 and 48 hpf respectively ( Fig - ure 3U ) . Both Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD and Epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD were expressed at 6 hpf and faint sig - nal was visible at 24 hpf . Neither Epb4 . 1l5 FERM nor Epb4 . 1l5 long _ Δ PBD were detectable at time points beyond 6 hpf ( Figure 3V ) , therefore a failure to rescue any moe - defects in these cases may be due to a rapid loss of the pro - tein generated by rescue constructs . Analysis of rescue with chimeric Epb4 . 1l5 PBD isoforms At 60 hpf , mutant moe - embryos exhibit reduced or absent brain ventricles , pericardial edema , and RPE defects ( Fig - ure 4A , B ) . Injection of epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD mRNA restored RPE integrity ( Figure 4C ) and retinal lamination ( data not shown ) in moe - mutants , but did not rescue the edema , brain ventricles were small or absent , and the tail curved ( Figure 4C , data not shown ) . In a heterozygous moe + / - incross , a roughly Mendelian inheritance ( 20 / 88 ; 23 % ) of individuals injected with epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA exhibited RPE defects ; how - ever , in all but one case , those defects were minor com - Table 1 : Quantitative assessment of phenotypic rescue of moe - mutant defects by injection of moe and epb4 . 1l5 mRNA constructs .

The severity of RPE defects varies in uninjected moe - mutants : an exam - ination of 35 uninjected moe - mutants showed that 8 had mild RPE defects ( 23 % , Figure 4G ) , 26 had moderate RPE defects ( 74 % , Figure 4I ) , and 1 had severe RPE defects ( 3 % , Figure 4K ) . The shift in severity of RPE defects from mostly moderate in moe - mutants to nearly normal in injected moe - mutants , suggests that injection of epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA largely restores RPE integrity . Because Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD largely restored RPE integ - rity in moe - mutants we examined whether retinal lamina - tion was also restored in these individuals . At 4 dpf , in wildtypes , GPF + rods are localized adjacent to the RPE ( Figure 4F ) . In moe - mutants , GPF + rods are ectopically localized throughout the retina , regardless of the severity of RPE defects ( Figure 4H , J , L ) . In moe - mutants injected with of epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA , most GPF + rods local - ize normally and are adjacent to the RPE . ( Figure 4N ) . When we injected epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA into embryos resulting from an incross of moe - / + individuals , we observed that more than 25 % exhibited edema , sug - gesting that injection of epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA has a tissue - dependent dominant negative effect . We deter - mined that 61 % of embryos had pericardial edema and 96 % had small or missing brain ventricles ( Table 1 ) . We next injected epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA into embryos from a wildtype incross and found a large proportion of these individuals exhibited pericardial edema and brain ventricle defects , but the RPE was normal , confirming that the dominant negative effects of Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD are limited to edema and brain ventricle formation ( Table 1 and Figure 4O ) . Lastly , Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD retains immunoreactivity with the anti - Epb4 . 1l5 long sera , and we show that the protein localizes cortically like Epb4 . 1l5 long ( Figure 4F ) , suggesting that the Epb4 . 1l5 long PBD is not required for cortical localization . Early Epb4 . 1l5 function rescues later retinal lamination and function Because mRNA injection could rescue early moe - mutant defects , we investigated whether later defects of retinal development were also rescued , in particular , whether dif - ferentiated cells acquired their correct laminar position and photoreceptors their normal morphology . We com - pared the retinas of 6 dpf wildtypes , moe - mutants , and moe - mutants injected with moe or epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA ( Fig - ure 5 , data not shown ) . The western blot experiments and immunohistochemistry ( data not shown ) showed that there is very little , if any , remaining Epb4 . 1l5 long protein after 3 dpf ( Figure 3U ) , the time at which most photore - ceptors begin to undergo morphogenesis . In wild - type ret - inas , nuclei are arranged in distinct layers , Müller glia are radially oriented and project to and contribute to the inner ( basal ) and outer ( apical ) limiting membranes of the retina , and rods and double cones display a polarized morphology with their outer segments projecting into the RPE ( Figure 5A , D , G ) . In moe - mutants , nuclei do not form distinct layers and the numbers of Müller glia , rods and double cones are reduced and their morphology is abnormal , although interestingly rods do make outer seg - ments ( Figure 5B , E , H ) . Whereas Müller glial morphology and retinal lamination are rescued in moe - mutants by injection of either moe or epb4 . 15 long mRNA , the morphology of photoreceptors ( rods and double cones ) is not ; instead of standing per - pendicular to the normal RPE ( Fig . 5A , D , G and Fig . 6A ) , those in moe - mutants injected with either moe or epb4 . 15 long mRNA , lie collapsed in a twisted heap adjacent to the RPE ( Fig . 5C , F , I and Fig . 6C , and data not shown ) . The failure to rescue photoreceptor morphology is likely because Moe or Epb4 . 15 long protein from injected mRNA is lost by the time photoreceptors undergo morphogene - sis . Previously , we showed in genetic mosaics that the outer segments of rods lacking moe function are larger than those in wild - type rods [ 21 ] . We sought to determine whether outer segments are also larger in rods in larvae where all cells have lost moe function by about 3 dpf . We measured the size of rod outer segments using anti - Rho - dopsin labeling . We found that rods in rescued moe - mutants ( i . e . injected with epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA ) were signif - icantly larger than rods in wild - type retinas at 6 dpf , whereas , rods in moe - mutants were significantly smaller than those in wild - type retinas ( Figure 5J ) . We also tested whether injection of epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA could restore vision to moe - mutants as measure by the optokinetic response ( OKR ) . The OKR measures the track - ing of the eyes to a moving stimulus [ 26 ] . In our study the stimulus consisted of alternating white and black vertical bars moving to the right on a projection screen and we measured tracked eye movements ( TM ) in response to the stimulus over a minute time period . We measured TM in wild - type , moe - mutants , and epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injected moe - mutant larvae immobilized in methylcellulose at 5 dpf . We found that wild - type larvae exhibited an average of 7 . 8 ( + / - 0 . 6 ) TM / minute , moe - mutants completely lacked TM , and epb4 . 1l5 mRNA injected moe - mutant lar - vae had an average of 3 . 6 ( + / - 0 . 7 ) TM / minute ( Figure 5K ) . Thus , even though photoreceptors have morpholog - ical defects in epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injection into moe - mutants many of these larvae have functional vision as measured by the optokinetic response .

Crb2a and Crb2b are the only Crumbs proteins shown to be expressed by zebrafish photoreceptors [ 4 , 21 ] and the antibodies we use recognize both proteins ( [ 21 ] , and data not shown ) . The ability to rescue the embryonic defects and retinal lamination with moe or epb4 . 1l5 long injection allows us to ask whether the localization of Crb2a / b in photoreceptors also requires moe function .

We examined outer segments by transmission electron micro - scopy ( TEM ) at 6 dpf in wild - type , moe - mutant and epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injected moe - mutant larvae . We found that disk morphology and packing appeared relatively normal in photoreceptors in moe - mutants and epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injected moe - mutants ( Figure 6D - F ) . Discussion In this study we sought to identify functionally important domains in the orthologous FERM proteins , zebrafish Moe and mouse Epb4 . 1l5 . Our strategy was to use evolu - tion , comparative genomics , and protein engineering to discover regions and sequences necessary for rescue of embryonic and early larval defects in moe deficient zebrafish . We first established that injection of wild - type moe mRNA into moe - embryos rescued all embryonic defects with the exception that mild pericardial edema persisted . In mammalian EST databases there are two major splice isoforms of Epb4 . 1l5 , Epb4 . 1l5 long that is 731 amino acids in length and is similar in length and shares sequence identity with Moe beyond the FERM domain ( Figure 1 ) and Epb4 . 1l5 short that is 504 amino acids . These two isoforms are identical until amino acid 444 and inter - estingly both contain a predicted PDZ - binding domain at their C ' terminus . We raised isoform - specific antibodies and examined expression of the two orthologues by west - ern blot of different mouse tissues . Both antibodies recog - nized a protein of about 75 kDa in all tissues , which is likely to be non - specific reactivity . Anti - Epb4 . 1l5 long rec - ognized a protein of the expected molecular weight of about 100 kDa in eye , brain , heart , lung , kidney and testis ; this expression profile agrees well with recently published immunohistochemical and mRNA expression ( in situ hybridization ) data in mammalian retinal , brain , and kid - ney tissues [ 24 , 27 ] . Anti - Epb4 . 1l5 short recognized protein of the expected molecular weight of about 56 kDa in brain , liver , lung , kidney , pancreas , spleen and gut . Not all tissues expressed both isoforms , for instance Epb4 . 1l5 long but not Epb4 . 1l5 short is found in the eye and Epb4 . 1l5 short but not Epb4 . 1l5 long is found in the gut , suggesting that the two isoforms may have non - overlapping functions . We tested whether either of these Epb4 . 1l5 isoforms could functionally substitute for Moe during embryonic and early larval development . Injection of mRNA encoding Epb4 . 1l5 long into moe - mutants rescues moe - mutant defects and leads to the restoration of retinal lamination , RPE integrity , normal brain ventricle morphology , and the api - cal localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO - 1 in the devel - oping retina and brain , similar to injection of moe mRNA . Like injection of moe mRNA into moe - mutants , mild peri - cardial edema persisted in these epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injected moe - mutants . We found that injection of epb4 . 1l5 short mRNA into moe - mutants failed to rescue any phenotypic defects and also failed to relocalize Crumbs proteins and ZO - 1 to the apical surface of the retina and brain . Interestingly , while exogenous Epb4 . 1l5 long protein is cortically localized in neuroepithelial cells similar to endogenous Moe protein , Epb4 . 1l5 short is localized cyto - plasmically , suggesting that either the PBDs or sequences unique to Epb4 . 1l5 long underlie Epb4 . 1l5 long protein localization . Although edema was reduced in moe - mutants by injection of moe or epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA , it was never abolished by mRNA injection . We presume that the edema in moe - mutants is caused by kidney dysfunction . There are several possible reasons for failure of mRNA injection to rescue kidney function . It is possible that Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 long func - tion is required for a longer period of time or perhaps con - tinually in the kidney and protein from injected mRNA is not around long enough completely restore kidney func - tion . A second possibility is that the Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 long constructs we used lack the sequence ( s ) needed to rescue kidney function . If this is the case , then those specific sequence ( s ) do not seem to reside in Epb4 . 1l5 short , since injection of epb4 . 1l5 short mRNA failed to rescue any peri - cardial edema , and the severity of edema was as severe as uninjected moe - mutants . There are , however , many minor splice variants of Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 long in the zebrafish and mammalian EST databases . Because all the proteins so far identified that interact with Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 ( also known as Ymo1 ) do so via the FERM domain [ 20 , 21 ] , we tested whether expression of a Epb4 . 1l5 construct encoding the first 346 amino acids ( Epb4 . 1l5 FERM ) , which includes the FERM domain , could rescue apical Crumbs proteins and ZO - 1 localization or any defects in moe - mutants . This construct failed to rescue apical Crumbs protein and ZO - 1 localization and any moe - defects , however , we could not detect Epb4 . 1l5 FERM protein after 6 hpf , suggesting that this mRNA or protein is unstable . The same result was observed when the PDZ - binding domain in Epb4 . 1l5 long was deleted ( Epb4 . 1l5 long _ Δ PBD ) ; there was no phenotypic rescue in moe - mutants and no apical Crumbs protein and ZO - 1 , and we did not detect Epb4 . 1l5 long _ Δ PBD protein after 6 hpf . These observations suggest that the PDZ - binding domain might be important for stability of Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 protein . PDZ domains are important mediators of protein interac - tions and have been shown to be important during the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity [ 28 , 29 ] . We sought to identify the importance of the PDZ - binding domain in Epb4 . 1l5 long by replacing it with the PDZ - domain from Epb4 . 1l5 short to generate the chimeric pro - tein Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD and by replacing the PDZ - BMC Developmental Biology 2008 , 8 : 3 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 213X / 8 / 3 Page 12 of 15 ( page number not for citation purposes ) domain in Epb4 . 1l5 short with the PDZ - domain from Epb4 . 1l5 long to generate the Epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD chimera . We found that injection of epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD or epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD mRNA into moe - mutants rescued api - cal localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO - 1 in the reti - nal and brain neuroepithelium , RPE integrity ( epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD almost complete rescue ) , and retinal lamination , but did not rescue brain ventricle morphol - ogy . Furthermore , injection of epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA into wild - type embryos caused a dominant negative phe - notype - brain ventricles were small or failed to form . These observations have revealed important insights into the function of Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 and suggest that both the PDZ - binding domain of Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 long and additional internal sequences in the C ' terminal domain Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 long ( aa 444 – 727 ) are important for the localiza - tion of ZO - 1 and Crumbs proteins , RPE integrity and ret - inal lamination . Several observations support the importance of both the PDZ - binding domain of Epb4 . 1l5 long and internal sequences in Epb4 . 1l5 long . The importance of the PDZ domain in Epb4 . 1l5 long is shown by the experiment where injection into moe - mutants of the chimeric construct epb4 . 1l5 short + long _ PBD , in which the PDZ - binding domain of Epb4 . 1l5 short is replaced by the PDZ - binding domain from Epb4 . 1l5 long , rescues apical ZO - 1 and panCrb , retinal lam - ination and RPE integrity , whereas , injection of epb4 . 1l5 short mRNA does not . This result suggests that there is some specificity between the PBD of Epb4 . 1l5 long and the PBD of Epb4 . 1l5 short . The importance of the internal sequence in Epb4 . 1l5 long ( aa 444 – 727 ) is shown by the experiment where injection into moe - mutants of the chi - meric construct epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD , in which in which the PDZ - binding domain of Epb4 . 1l5 long is replaced by the PDZ - binding domain from Epb4 . 1l5 short , rescues apical ZO - 1 and panCrb , retinal lamination and mostly RPE integrity , whereas , injection of epb4 . 1l5 short mRNA does not . Unexpectedly , injection of epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD mRNA into wild - type embryos caused a dominant phenotype that included brain ventricle defects and edema that are similar to those in moe - mutants . One possibility is that Epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD competes with endogenous Moe and takes a protein necessary for brain ventricle formation away from the Crumbs complex . Taken together , our experiments have suggested that Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 proteins are modular proteins and that the PDZ - binding domains have specificity in some tissues . Moe and other cell polarity determinants , Crb2a / Ome , aPKC λ , and Nok , are required for proper lamination of the zebrafish retina [ 4 - 8 , 22 ] . The time at which these pro - teins are needed for lamination has not been determined . Since we see very little Moe or Epb4 . 1l5 long protein after 60 hpf , we suggest that early Moe or Epb4 . 1l5 long function is sufficient to rescue retinal lamination and function . In moe or epb4 . 1l5 long injected moe - mutants at 6 dpf , Müller glial cell processes are properly oriented and span the thickness of the retina , and the retina has distinct nuclear layers . Furthermore , the vast majority of rod and double cone photoreceptors localize correctly to outer most por - tion of the retina to form an outer nuclear layer . Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of Epb4 . 1l5 long rescued moe - mutant retinas , revealed that res - cued rods form outer segments , but they were not always oriented with their outer segments toward the RPE ( Figure 5D - I , 6D - F ) . This may be a consequence of the failure of the rescued individuals to establish or maintain the OLM ( Figure 6C ) . Despite the morphological defects of rods and cones in the moe - mutants injected with epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA , many of these larvae are visually competent as tested by optokinetic response . Interestingly , our ultrastructural analysis revealed that moe - rods formed outer segments , complete with organized membranous discs , suggesting that mechanisms that dictate apical opsin transport and disc formation do not require moe function . Previously , we showed that Moe function is required for the localization of Crb2a and ZO - 1 protein at the apical surface of the developing retina in zebrafish embryos [ 7 , 21 ] . We show here that in the wild type retina at 6 dpf , anti - panCrb labeling localizes just above the OLM in the subapical region . In moe - photoreceptors , anti - panCrb labeling is not detectible , and ZO - 1 appears disorganized . When we examined photoreceptors in epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA rescued moe - mutants at 6 dpf , which is several days after detectable Epb4 . 1l5 long protein , we observed that both ZO - 1 and Crumbs proteins are present in the photorecep - tor region ( Figure 6C ) . The design of our rescue experi - ment allowed us to analyze the localization of Crumbs proteins and ZO - 1 in rescued moe - photoreceptors several days after exogenous Epb4 . 1l5 long was gone . In epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injected moe - mutants , ZO - 1 and panCrb labeling is not normal and mislocalized ectopic plagues of ZO - 1 and panCrb labeling appears to be at the interface of pho - toreceptors , and / or photoreceptors and Müller glia and there is no clear relationship between ZO - 1 and anti - pan - Crb labeling . Thus , Epb4 . 1l5 / More function is required to maintain , or establish , the OLM and the localization of Crumbs proteins relative to it . We measured the size of rod outer segments in moe - mutants that had been injected with epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA but that lack measurable Moe protein during photorecep - tor morphogenesis , and found that these genetically moe - deficient rods were nearly twice the normal size ( 362 μ m 3 compared to wild - type outer segments 197 μ m 3 ) . This observation is in agreement with previous data from our BMC Developmental Biology 2008 , 8 : 3 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 213X / 8 / 3 Page 13 of 15 ( page number not for citation purposes ) lab and others implicating Moe and the Drosophila orthologue , Yurt , as negative regulators of apical mem - brane size in photoreceptors [ 20 , 21 ] . We observed that in uninjected moe - mutants , rod outer segments are smaller than wild - types ( 90 . 9 μ m 3 compared to 362 μ m 3 ) , this could be a consequence of the general ill health of moe mutants at 6 dpf , and / or the isolation of photoreceptors from factors secreted by the RPE and Müller glia [ 30 , 31 ] . Conclusion Our strategy to use comparative genomics and protein engineering has revealed that the function of Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 protein is modular and that particular regions can be assigned particular functions . We also show that the C ' terminal domain that encodes the PDZ - binding domain in Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 long is important but not suf - ficient to confer full protein function to the FERM domain and that other sequences in Moe and Epb4 . 1l5 long are important . The next challenge will be to identify the PDZ - containing protein that interacts with the PDZ - binding domain in Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 long and the additional pro - tein ( s ) that interact with the unique sequences in Epb4 . 1l5 long . Although the role of the Crumbs complex in epithelial morphogenesis has been much studied , the molecular mechanism of the Crumbs complex function is still unknown . The identification of additional proteins that interact with Moe / Epb4 . 1l5 long may help to deter - mine the mechanistic function of the Crumbs complex . Methods Animals AB wild - type strain and the moe b 781 allele were maintained and staged as described previously [ 7 , 32 ] . For analysis requiring EGFP - expressing rods , the moe b 781 allele was crossed into the Tg ( Xop : EGFP ) transgenic line [ 33 ] . To block pigmentation , embryos were treated with 2 . 5 μ g / mL phenylthiourea ( PTU ) beginning at about 20 hpf . RNA injections For mRNA transcription , PCRTopoII or pBSII vectors con - taining the cDNAs of full - length moe , epb4 . 1l5 long , epb4 . 1l5 short , or myc - tagged fusions of the following con - structs ; epb4 . 1l5 long , epb4 . 1l5 FERM ( 1 – 346 N - terminal amino acids ) , epb4 . 1l51 long _ PBD ( epb4 . 1l5 long with the four C ' terminal TTEL deleted ) , epb4 . 1l51 short + long _ PBD ( short C - terminal AAMTEI replaced with LLTTEL ) or epb4 . 1l5 long + short _ PBD ( long C - terminal LLTTEL replaced with AAMTEI ) , were linearized by NotI or PspOMI restric - tion digest , and transcribed with the Sp6 or T7 Message Machine transcription kit ( Ambion ) . Roughly 100 – 250 pg ( amount varied per construct for a final 0 . 2 fM ) of mRNA was injected into yolk of 1 – 4 cell embryos obtained from an incross of moe b 781 or moe b 781 / Xop - GFP heterozygotes . For those mRNAs that failed to rescue at the above molarity , we tested whether injecting more res - cued , and in all cases higher amounts failed . Concurrent with immunohistochemical analysis , we probed with anti - Moe on alternate sections to confirm the moe - geno - type . All constructs were sequenced prior to mRNA syn - thesis . Antibody production We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C - terminal 20 amino acids of mammalian Crb2 ( N ' AGAR - LEMDSVLKVPPEERLI C ' ; 95 % identity with D . rerio Crb2a , 90 % identity with Crb2b ) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin . This anti - Crb antibody recognizes GST - tagged recombinant purified intracellular domains of D . rerio Crb1 , Crb2a , Crb2b , Crb3a , and Crb3b by west - ern blot but not GST alone ( data not shown ) . Rabbit anti - bodies were generated to be specific for either Epb4 . 1l5 long or Epb4 . 1l5 short by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant His - Epb4 . 1l5 long _ 445 – 731 and His - Epb4 . 1l5 short _ 445 – 504 protein that was purified with His - Link resin ( Promega ) . All rabbits were immunized and boosted with about 500 μ g protein in PBS ( University of Massachusetts - Amherst antibody facility ) . Anti - Epb4 . 1l5 short serum was affinity purified against 2 mg GST - Epb4 . 1l5 short _ 445 – 504 ( cDNA cloned into pGEX - 4T1 vector ( Amhersham Biosciences ) that was purified with Glutathione Sepharose ( Amersham Biosciences ) , cross - linked to a NHS - activated Sepharose ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) column , and eluted in 100 mM glycine pH 2 . 5 . Affinity purified antibodies were dialyzed against PBS , and BSA was added to 1mg / ml and glycerol to 50 % . Western blot analysis Protein was extracted from mouse tissues by homogeniza - tion in PBS with protease inhibitors ( Complete Mini , Roche ) , 1 mM AEBSF , 0 . 2 mM Na 2 SO 4 , 1 % Trition X - 100 . 60 μ g of total protein from each tissue was resolved on a 10 % SDS - PAGE gel . Zebrafish protein was prepared by homogenizing zebrafish embryos or larvae in 2 μ l reduc - ing sample buffer ( plus protease inhibitors ) per individ - ual . To reduce interference from yolk proteins , embryos were deyolked according to Link et al . , 2006 [ 34 ] . Samples were denatured at 100°C for 5 min , vortexed , and insolu - ble debris pelleted by centrifugation . Western blotting was conducted according to standard procedures . Primary antibodies : rabbit anti - Epb4 . 1l5 long 1 : 750 ; affinity puri - fied rabbit anti - Epb4 . 1l5 short 1 : 15 , 5 μ g / mL final ; rabbit anti - Myc 1 : 10 , 000 ( Bethyl ) ; mouse anti - α - Tubulin 1 : 2000 ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) . Immunohistochemistry Zebrafish embryos and larvae were fixed in 4 % parafor - maldehyde / 0 . 1M NaPO 4 pH 7 . 2 for 1 hr at room temper - ature , washed in 0 . 1M NaPO 4 pH 7 . 2 , embedded in agar , and equilibrated in 30 % sucrose , and frozen sections cut ( 18 μ m or 30 μ m ) . Sections were incubated in blocking BMC Developmental Biology 2008 , 8 : 3 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 213X / 8 / 3 Page 14 of 15 ( page number not for citation purposes ) solution ( 20 % goat serum , 10 mg / mL BSA , 145 mM NaCl , 10 mM lysine , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) , then in primary and secondary antibody , overnight at 4°C and 3 hours at room temperature respectively ( rabbit anti - Moe 1 : 500 , rabbit anti - panCrb 1 : 1000 , mouse anti - ZO - 1 1 : 10 , rabbit anti - CAII 1 : 500 , mouse anti - ZPR1 1 : 100 , mouse anti - Rhodopsin 1 : 100 ( B6 – 30 ) , goat anti - mouse and goat anti - rabbit 1 : 100 ( Molecular Probes and Jackson Immu - noResearch ) , and TO - PRO - 3 1 : 500 ( Invitrogen ) ) . Slides were cover - slipped with Prolong anti - fade reagent ( Invit - rogen ) . Images were acquired on a Zeiss 510C META con - focal microscope and processed with ImageJ 1 . 37v [ 35 ] . Volume determination of outer segments was performed on albino larvae by quantifying the voxels represented by Rhodopsin ( B6 – 30 ) labeling in 3D reconstructions with the ImageJ plugin Sync Measure 3D [ 36 ] . Transmission electron microscopy Larvae were fixed at 6 days in 4 % PFA / 0 . 5 % gluaralde - hyde / 0 . 1M NaPO 4 pH 7 . 2 overnight at 4°C . Samples were rinsed , incubated in 1 % osmium tetroxide in PBS at room temperature , dehydrated in an ethanol series , and then rotated in a 1 : 1 ratio of 80 % ethanol : LR White resin ( Elec - tron Microscopy Sciences ) for one hour at room tempera - ture , and in a change of the same solution overnight at room temperature . Samples were then equilibrated in 100 % LR White 2X for 2 hours , and polymerized . Ultrathin sections ( 100 nm ) were cut then stained with 2 % uranyl acetate for 30 min and 0 . 5 % lead citrate for 12 min at room temperature . Sections were visualized on a JOEL100S Transmission Electron Microscope . Optokinetic response Briefly , Optokinetic Response ( OKR ) was measured according to protocol modified from Rinner et al . , 2005 [ 37 ] , at 5 dpf in WT , moe b781 , and epb4 . 1l5 long mRNA injected moe b781 mutants that were immobilized in a drop of 2 % Methyl Cellulose . A dissecting scope was used to visualize Tracked eye Movements ( TM ) per minute in response to a moving visual stimulus . Cycling vertical lines were generated with Optomotor 1 . 2 software ( f , 1Hz ; λ , 120 pxls ; speed , 5 ) , and rear projected with an inFocus LCD digital projector on a 180° curved screen approximately 4 . 5 cm from larvae ( Optomotor 1 . 2 soft - ware was generously provided by Harold Burgess ) .
