Does scientiﬁc eminence endure ? Making sense of the most cited economists , psychologists and sociologists in textbooks ( 1970 – 2010 ) Philipp Korom 1 Received : 24 October 2017 / Published online : 28 May 2018 (cid:2) Akade´miai Kiado´ , Budapest , Hungary 2018 Abstract This paper examines the concept of textbook eminence and asks whether this speciﬁc form of scholarly recognition is of a temporal rather than enduring nature . Based on an analysis of 30 leading textbooks in economics , psychology and economics from the 1970s and 2010s , it is established that less than a third of all eminent scholars remain across the period as the most cited authors . Therefore , the average ‘‘half - life’’ of textbook eminence is shorter than half a century . Textbook eminence , it seems , is associated ﬁrst and foremost with ‘certiﬁed recognition , ’ expressed through encyclopedia entries dedi - cated to individual scholars . In psychology , and partly in sociology , citation impact turns out to be a further signiﬁcant correlate . In economics , however , textbook eminence is completely detached from peer recognition , as measured by the h - index . The identiﬁed short ‘‘half - life’’ of textbook eminence does not necessarily imply a replacement of older elites by younger researchers . In sociology , very few 20th century newcomers have yet attained textbook eminence . Keywords Scientiﬁc eminence (cid:2) Textbooks (cid:2) Citation analysis (cid:2) Bibliometrics Introduction Psychology was the ﬁrst discipline to venture into measuring scientiﬁc eminence . The 19th century psychologist Francis Galton examined evidence for the inheritance of abilities by studying , among others , well - known scientists . In English Men of Science Galton ( 1874 ) makes great use of the word ‘eminence’ without rigorously deﬁning it . His ‘‘litmus test’’ for the word seems to be national acclaim or public consensus concerning greatness . Endeavors to quantify scientiﬁc eminence gained momentum with the publication of the directory American Men of Science ( Cattell 1906b ) , a collection of biographical sketches & Philipp Korom philipp . korom @ uni - graz . at 1 Department for Sociology , University of Graz , Universita¨tsstrasse 15 / G4 , 8010 Graz , Austria 123 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s11192 - 018 - 2781 - z of thousands of men of science in the USA edited by the owner of Science , McKeen Cattell ( Godin 2007 ) . Cattell based his studies on two concepts : productivity , deﬁned as the number of men of science a nation produces ( Cattell 1903 , p . 591 ) ; and performance , deﬁned as scientiﬁc contributions to research as judged by peers . Cattell believed that ‘‘expert judgement is the best [ … ] criterion of performance’’ ( Cattell 1906a , p . 702 ) . Many followed in his footsteps pursuing the goal of quantifying eminence in academia ; early scholars in this area appear to have regarded relying on peer judgment as a feasible route . Annin , Boring , and Watson , for example , identiﬁed important psychologists by asking a panel of nine judges—two of whom were Boring and Watson themselves—to rate names on a 3 - point evaluation scale . Such attempts were met with severe criticism ( Zusne 1975 ) , partly because it was doubted that any similar expert panel would come to the same conclusions . The effort was followed closely by calls for new methods . Psychology and other disciplines turned to citations as the key indicator of recognition , to gauge how widely a scholar’s research is used by others in the ﬁeld . Scientometric studies mushroomed after the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) was launched in 1964 , which provided researchers with citations to scientiﬁc papers appearing in an increasing number of digitalized journals ( Cole and Cole 1967 ) . To this day , journal - based citations are seen as a relatively objective , yet imperfect , indicator of scholarly reputation ( Offer and So¨derberg 2016 ) . Douglas ( 1992 , p . 405 ) refers to them as a ‘‘ … ‘blue - collar’ index of impact , made primarily by people in the trenches rather than by the generals’’ . A downside of journal - based citations is that they neglect many relevant genres of literature in the form of books . Therefore , strands of research emerged that centered principally on introductory textbook citations . Early studies along these lines can be found in sociology ( Bain 1962 ; Oromaner 1968 ) and psychology ( Kaess and Bousﬁeld 1954 ) . The ‘‘textbook approach’’ was later also adopted in economics ( Liner 2002 ) . Again it appeared to many that a complex phenomenon such as ‘‘scientiﬁc eminence’’ cannot be captured using a single method ( Roeckelein 1996 ) . The question was : Important from whose point of view ? Who is more important for the discipline , a sociologist who is recognized as such by the multitudes who have passed through an introductory sociology class or one who is recognized by the select few who are exposed to the American Sociological Review ? ( Oromaner 1969 , p . 334 ) . It is fair to say that state - of - the - art literature has settled on a mix of measures such as awards , surveys , and citations in textbooks and journals to operationalize scientiﬁc eminence ( Chan and Torgler 2015 ; Diener et al . 2014 ; Haggbloom et al . 2002 ; Zechmeister and Zechmeister 2000 , p . 6 ) . What remains unanswered , however , is what aspect of scientiﬁc eminence the ‘‘text - book approach’’ actually measures ? The assertion that ‘‘ … introductory textbook coverage reﬂects the degree to which textbook writers believe the work of a scientist is important , but also to some degree the extent to which they believe it will be interesting and understandable to students … ’’ is a gross oversimpliﬁcation of the nature of introductory texts ( Diener et al . 2014 , p . 21 ) . In his Confessions of a Textbook Writer , McConnell ( 1978 ) points to ﬁve different audiences—students , instructors , peers , colleagues , and publishers—that ‘‘make very different and often conﬂicting demands on the writer’’ ( ibid : 167 ) . It is well known that textbook writers and editors closely observe the textbook market and that textbooks go through extensive peer review ( Kendall 1999 ) . Some even argue that intrusive market pressures and editorial control make ‘‘books write authors’’ ( Agger 1989 ) . 910 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 Another difﬁculty inherent in the writing of textbooks is that authors are not only supposed to present the well - established fundamentals of the discipline , but also take account of recent work in a rapidly moving set of research problems over which there is substantial disagreement . Such new developments provide them some room to differ from previous textbooks , despite the predominance of uniform market strategies . A priori , what a textbook citation means is anything but clear and still needs to be empirically established , which is one of the main goals of this article . Once we can make a statement as to what textbook eminence actually stands for , the question becomes whether it is enduring or ephemeral . A common assertion is that , because of the progressive nature of scientiﬁc inquiry , prominent contributors to a disci - pline tend to fade into the background as new discoveries are made . It is often argued , particularly in the social sciences , that a scholar’s work is easily forgotten once the immediate ﬂush of theoretical ‘‘sex appeal’’ has subsided ( Rule 1997 ) . While we are aware that scientiﬁc truth is transitory , and therefore scientiﬁc eminence is highly unlikely to obtain longevity , empirical evidence concerning the ‘‘half - life’’ of eminent scientists is not available . Therefore , the second goal of this article is to investigate how long star scholars in three different disciplines are likely to remain heavily cited in textbooks . The analysis of ﬁve widely used introductory textbooks from the 1970s and the 2010s in economics , psychology and sociology—a total of 30 books—yields the following results : Scientiﬁc eminence in the ‘‘textbook world’’ indicates , ﬁrst and foremost , that the knowledge a given scholar contributes to the discipline is approved by at least one gen - eration of scholars ( ‘‘certiﬁed eminence’’ ) . In psychology , and to some extent in sociology , peer recognition—as measured by the h - index—is a weak correlate , but nevertheless important . Textbook economics appears , however , to have a clear distinctive culture ; whoever ﬁgures high in the ‘‘textbook world , ’’ ﬁgures low in the ‘‘journal world . ’’ For the bulk of eminent scholars , the ‘‘half - life’’ for textbook eminence is shorter than half a century . There are cross - disciplinary differences ; in economics and psychology newcomers replace already renowned authors , while only very few 20th century scholars attain text - book eminence in sociology . Introductory textbooks as genre That introductory textbooks comprise a genre of their own becomes apparent from the reactions these books elicit . Scientists from all disciplines jest about the deceptions and inaccuracies—made for the sake of clarity , simplicity , or proﬁt—contained in introductory texts ( Morawski 1992 , p . 162 ) . Another common complaint is that there is a considerable gap between what economists or sociologists do and what they teach . The economist Colander ( 2005 , p . 251 ) , for example , argues that new developments such as the blossoming of behavioral economics studies or the rise of evolutionary game theory and New Institutional Economics have not been incorporated in most textbooks . The sociologists Manza et al . ( 2010 , p . 271 ) bemoan that contemporary textbook writers persistently present structural functionalism , conﬂict theory , and symbolic interactionism to frame the theoretical core of the discipline , even if these paradigms are no longer central to research . Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 911 123 While there are many explanations for these observations , 1 one can easily guess why academicians view introductory textbooks with suspicion . The task put to a textbook writer—namely to comprehensively introduce students with little , if any , familiarity with the discipline and thereby sacriﬁcing detail and preferring consistency over eclecticism— conﬂicts with the canons of scholarship that they have internalized . In an essay revealingly entitled The Function of Dogma in Scientiﬁc Research , Thomas Kuhn introduces natural science textbooks as repositories of exemplars from the reigning paradigm within a ﬁeld conveying the impression that ‘‘ … scientists agree about what it is that every students of the ﬁeld must know’’ ( Kuhn 1963 , p . 349 ) . The same holds true for economics . Reading more recent editions of Samuelson’s Economics , 2 which had a con - siderable impact on the profession , one quickly realizes that economics is presented as an evolutionary science , suggesting to the students that ‘‘ … all insigniﬁcant theories have been weeded out and all that is important is incorporated in the current body of knowl - edge’’ ( Klamer 1990 , p . 141 ) . In general , the genre of textbooks has changed substantially over time . Very early textbooks , such as the psychologist William James’ lengthy Principles of Psychology ( James 1890 ) , set out to articulate what the discipline should be . Interestingly , even in the nineteenth century , when commercial publishing was elite - oriented , James had to dovetail closely with the editor and comply with restrictions ( James 1920 ) . In the 20th century , psychology textbooks became more student - oriented ( 1930s – 1940s ) , evolving towards becoming more encyclopedic ( 1950s – 1960s ) containing , among other things , signiﬁcantly more references ( Weiten and Brewer 1992 ) . In the late 1960s , a pervasive trend in psychology , sociology and economics set in : homogenization . For example , economists call the 1950s to 2010s the ‘‘Samuelson Era’’ ( Colander 2011 , p . 344 ) . From the 1950s onwards , economics textbooks were highly inﬂuenced by Samuelson’s Economics , even though it was ﬁrst published in 1948 . Of course , there were adaptations , most of which reﬂected the development of the discipline : When poverty was in , in went a chapter on poverty . When radical economics was in , in went a chapter on Marxian economics . When monetarism was in , in went a discussion of monetarism ( Stiglitz 1988 , p . 173 ) . In sociology , British ( and other national ) textbooks started to emulate the American - style blockbuster textbooks ( Platt 2008 ) . In psychology , few ‘‘instructors escape the impression when examining the row of publishers’ copies wedged on their shelves that they all look alike’’ , something conﬁrmed by several content analyses ( Zechmeister and Zechmeister 2000 , p . 6 ) . What explains the ‘‘mushrooming’’ of ‘‘copycats’’ in the introductory textbook market ? An innovator who departs from pre - established templates takes a risk . If the market fails to ﬁnd his approach attractive , the publisher’s large investment of resources is lost . Editors know from experience that marginally distinctive texts can turn quickly into loss making ventures . To control risk , editors increasingly turn to market research , surveying professors about their topical priorities and employing many internal and external reviewers . Fewer 1 Manza et al . ( 2010 , p . 300 ) make two strong arguments . On the supply side , publishers pressure for conformity to textbook norms and for content that is ‘‘tried and true’’ . On the demand side , heavy teaching loads , especially at the bottom of the academic hierarchy , encourage the routinization of instruction . 2 The ﬁrst edition of Economics was published in 1948 , and every 3 – 4 years later another edition was published . The ﬁrst edition sold 121 , 453 copies . In total , Economics had sold more than 4 million copies , and was translated into 41 languages ( Gottesman et al . 2005 , p . 97 ) . 912 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 resources are allocated to desirable innovations as publishers have become considerably more reluctant to try something new . Consequently , products at the fringes of the market decrease and even the number of new titles shrivels ( Manza et al . 2010 , 291 ) . These trends towards homogenization and market contraction suggest that the textbook genre in academic disciplines has become increasingly differentiated from handbooks , encyclopedias or scholarly monographs , a contention well supported by the observation that introductory textbooks’ impact on scholarship has been in strong decline since the 1980s ( Wright 1995 ) . Introductory textbooks and scientiﬁc eminence Textbooks are attributed a pivotal role in the certiﬁcation of knowledge , a concept pop - ularized by Norman W . Storer , which originated from Robert K . Merton . Merton postu - lated that ‘‘the institutional goal of science is the extension of certiﬁed knowledge ’’ ( Merton 1973 , p . 270 , italics added ) . However , while Merton was particularly concerned with the genuine values of science that explain science’s success as the locus of reliable knowledge of nature—disinterestedness , organized skepticism—Storer focused on the procedural aspects of truth - ﬁnding in science . He argued that if a direct proof of the validity of a novel theoretical framework is not possible , scientists base their judgment on how well the new contribution ‘ﬁts’ the current knowledge as a reﬁnement or extension of it : ‘‘Only when a contribution is ‘certiﬁed’ , that is , acceptable to other scientists under the canons of proof they share , will it be welcomed’’ ( Storer 1966 , p . 119 ) . 3 The concept of certiﬁcation implies the existence of different stages in the acceptance of an idea by a discipline . In the ﬁrst stage , empirical research may be replicated and theories evaluated in terms of consistency . In the second , peers may accept the contribution as a valid extension of knowledge . Rothman ( 1971 ) suggests that at stage three , the subject becomes a legitimate topic for inclusion in textbooks , and that it may be regarded a serious omission not to publish it . References to authors in textbooks thus appear to be a fairly clear indicator for a certain aspect of scientiﬁc eminence ; namely the extent to which an author has contributed to the stock of accepted core knowledge in a given discipline . Contemporary scholars expanding frontiers of knowledge or developing potentially fruitful lines of investigation are not captured as the scientiﬁc community has not yet reached any conclusive judgment as to whether or not the contributions are sufﬁciently signiﬁcant to be included in the disci - pline’s core texts . Many would disagree with this assertion , however . Economists Breit and Huston ( 1997 ) , for example , interpret textbook references as an indicator of ‘‘inﬂuence’’ that is often unrelated to ‘‘reputation’’ ; i . e . the professional judgment of peers . By ‘‘inﬂuence’’ the authors mean political inﬂuence . As an illustrative example of an economist who scores higher on inﬂuence—measured by references in textbooks—than on reputation ranking— measured by citations in journals—they name John K . Galbraith , a Harvard economist best known for his books that address a wide audience and which shaped political discourse . 4 3 Storer’s analysis of professional recognition is in part transferable to the social sciences as the verisimilitude manifest in many social theorists’ work is not easily empirically speciﬁable . Marx’s central notions , for example , cannot be simply veriﬁed or falsiﬁed . 4 It turns out that this assessment of John K . Galbraith’s scholarly reputation is wrong . Based on com - prehensive JSTOR citation data Offer and So¨derberg ( Offer and So¨derberg 2016 , p . 137 ) come to the Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 913 123 In what follows , we aim to further elucidate these matters by empirically exploring , among other things , the correlates of textbook references . Data and variables Data To tackle our research questions empirically , we selected ﬁve textbooks from the 1970s and a further ﬁve from the 2010s that are representative for one of three disciplines in the Anglo - Saxon world : sociology ; psychology ; and economics . All books were clearly intended to introduce college students to the discipline ( deduced from the preface ) and emphasize pedagogy ( best illustrated by the many pedagogic devices introduced ) . All three disciplines have a textbook tradition that reaches back to the middle of the 19th century ( Colander 2011 ; Weiten and Brewer 1992 ) . In the 1970s , the trend towards the homogenization of introductory textbooks was already established . Despite a certain ‘‘sameness’’ , all of the 1970s textbooks differ considerably more in content than those from the 2010s . 5 Most of the 1970s textbooks’ authors were no longer active in the 2010s . Much more important , however , is that the theories and perspectives to which the 1970s books adhered—such as structural functionalism in sociology or Keynesian theory in eco - nomics—had lost currency by the 2010s , which should enable us to trace change in all three disciplines . The selection of these textbooks was based on sales ﬁgures , as far as this type of information was available for economics ; McGraw - Hill shared this information for Samuelson’s and McConnell’s text ( Elzinga 1992 ) and both market leaders were sampled . Due to the general lack of respective information , we had to settle on an alternative indicator to discern whether certain books were more widely adopted than others . The digital tool used was WorldCat , a collaborative venture in which libraries contribute their records to a consortium collection , which then repackage them as a composition catalog . 6 WorldCat indicates the number of libraries in which a certain textbook is available , a ﬁgure that became our main selection criterion . For each discipline , we searched about 100 textbooks that are analyzed in the literature ( Griggs and Christopher 2016 ; Liner 2002 ; Oromaner 1968 ) . 7 We found patterns typical within ‘‘winner - takes - all’’ markets . For the 2010s , Gerrig’s text is the only psychology introductory textbook for which WorldCat identiﬁed more than 1300 libraries . In sociology , Macionis’ text is the only contemporary sociology introductory textbook with more than 800 hits . In each discipline , about ﬁve titles are placed in the upper middle - range , while the bulk of textbooks signiﬁcantly lag behind the few bestselling books . As can be seen from Table 1 , by discipline textbooks differ marginally in size and hugely in organization . Between 1970 and 2010 , the ‘average textbook’ in psychology stayed at about 730 pages , while in sociology the ‘average textbook’ grew from 510 to 750 Footnote 4 continued conclusion that ‘‘among the Nobel Prize winners , he [ John K . Galbraith ] would have ranked fourteenth in total citations in 2005’’ . 5 All 30 selected textbooks are listed in the Appendix A1 . 6 Abbott ( 2014 ) hints to the fact that the tool is not ﬂawless . In fact , one ﬁnds many separate records for what are in fact identical items . We thus had to double - check all WorldCat outputs . 7 Search results for selected textbooks are presented in the Appendix . 914 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 pages , and in economics it grew from 620 to 800 pages . The typical organization into chapters is by far the most ﬁne - grained in economics , with an average of 34 chapters in 2010 . In contrast , the latest editions of textbooks in sociology contain about 16 chapters , and 20 in psychology . The most pronounced interdisciplinary differences are observed with regard to citation practices ( see Table 1 ) . Working from the author indices , we determined the number of textbook pages on which scholars were referenced . 8 We adjusted for bibliography pages ( i . e . ‘‘55 – 57’’ counts as three pages ) but did not apply any weighting system for self - citations . 9 Citations of scholarly work are sparse in economics ; in both the 1970s and 2010s samples , fewer than 500 scholars are listed in the index , suggesting a strong ten - dency to discuss economic models without any reference to their intellectual origin . 10 The ‘person index’ has become substantially longer in psychology textbooks ( average of 3456 scholars listed ) than those in sociology ( average of 1389 scholars listed ) . Psychologists also tend to reference the scholars listed in the appendix more often , which is indicative of the encyclopedic nature of the key textbooks currently available in the discipline . In 8 We excluded non - scientists ( such as US presidents ) , celebrities and and other persons that have not contributed to the respective discipline . 9 It should be noted , however , that Anthony Giddens , for example , cites his own work in the 6th edition of Sociology on 14 different pages . 10 Samuelson’s textbook stands out through a comparatively many literature references . Other studied textbook in economics refer to less than 100 economists .

Contemporary psychology textbooks stand out insofar as we ﬁnd references in the name index to be more equally distributed between the bottom 50 % , the middle 40 % and the top 10 % of listed scholars . With scientiﬁc eminence our prime concern , we selected scholars with the highest page score . There is , however , no ‘‘magic’’ page count that separates scholars worthy of study from the rest . Therefore we settled on two different inclusion criteria . First , the scholar must be mentioned in at least two out of the ﬁve textbooks . Second , we set the cut - off line in such a way that we could compare an almost equal number of scholars across time in each discipline , thereby excluding a minimum number of scholars who are , in general , ranked among the most eminent representatives of their discipline ( Blaug and Vane 2003 ; Diener et al . 2014 ; Oromaner 1968 ) . These decisions left us with different numbers of top referenced scholars in each discipline ( see Table 1 ) . Even by putting the page count as low as three pages in economics , we still were able to include only 54 eminent economists for the 2010s . Variables To probe the meanings of textbook citations , we tested associations with sets of other variables that stand for productivity and / or publication impact , certiﬁed eminence , and academic prestige . In what follows , we explain how we generated these variables and what they capture . Table 2 Descriptive statistics of all variables used in this study Sociology Economics Psychology 1970s 2010s 1970s 2010s 1970s 2010s Google Scholar citations 35 , 217 . 1 56 , 617 . 3 35 , 716 . 6 54 , 426 . 2 39 , 448 . 9 75 , 346 Citations to most cited publication 9220 . 5 10 , 290 . 0 8272 9041 . 6 8378 . 2 11 , 343 . 5 H - Index 45 . 3 108 . 7 48 . 4 67 . 0 55 . 3 92 . 0 Number of eponyms / / 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 7 0 . 4 Number of quotations in SSQ 5 . 2 4 . 1 6 . 6 4 . 2 2 . 5 1 . 6 Britannica entry 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 5 0 . 2 Specialist encyclopedia entry 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 8 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 2 President ASA / ESA / AEA 0 . 3 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 1 W .

The average number of Google Scholar citations in sociology in the 1970s was thus 35 , 217 while about 30 % of all sampled scholars in sociology were elected president of the ASA 916 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 Google Scholar citations Google Scholar covers print and academic journals , conference proceedings , books , theses and other outlets available from major academic publishers , professional societies or gov - ernment agencies . Studies show that Google Scholar citations correlate with ISI ( Web of Knowledge ) citations 11 but that they are more comprehensive ( Kousha and Thelwall 2007 ) . Google Scholar is likely to provide a valid measure of high - impact within , and partly outside academia , especially for a book - heavy ﬁeld like sociology . To analyze Google Scholar citation data we used Harzing (cid:2) s Publish or Perish ( PoP ) software ( Harzing 2015 ) . We use overall citations as well as the number of citations given to the most cited publication . H - index ( Google Scholar based ) The h - index indicates the number of ‘papers’ by a scholar that have been cited at least h times ( Hirsch 2005 ) , Thus , an h of 40 indicates that a scholar has produced 40 ‘papers’ cited at least 40 times . The Google Scholar based h - index is arguably the best indicator for assessing the frequency and consistency with which authors have produced work that has had an impact on scholarship . The h - index is only marginally inﬂuenced by a small number of well - cited contributions and measures quality and quantity simultaneously . For example , scholars who contributed only few landmark studies will have a low h - index . Eponyms Eponymy is deﬁned by Robert K . Merton as ‘‘ [ the ] practice of afﬁxing the name of the scientist to all or part of what he has found [ … ] In this way , scientists leave their signatures indelibly in history ; their names enter into all the scientiﬁc languages of the world . ’’ ( Merton 1957 , pp . 642 – 643 ) . Eponyms function as implicit citations of contributions by certain scholars that are widely recognized and have stood the test of time , at least partly . In most cases a law , theory , hypothesis , effect , or principle is named after the ﬁrst scholar to have discovered it ( e . g . Pavlovian Conditioning Principles , Schumpeterian entrepreneur , etc . ) . For psychology and economics we used eponymous dictionaries ( Roeckelein 1998 ; Segura and Braun 2004 ) to count the eponyms referring to one of the selected scholars . In sociology , eponyms are rare and , for the purpose of this study , can be disregarded . Epo - nyms can be seen as a speciﬁc measure of what one may call ‘certiﬁed eminence’ . Encyclopedia entries Entries in encyclopedias are another manifestation of ‘certiﬁed eminence’ . Editors of key encyclopediasin their respective disciplinetypically devoteentries onlyto thosesociologists , economists and psychologists who are perceived to have deeply inﬂuenced the development of the discipline and whose inﬂuence on intellectual life is , at least to some degree , persistent . The sources used here are the encyclopedia Britannica , three discipline - speciﬁc encyclope - dias ( Durlauf and Blume 2008 ; Kazdin 2000 ; Ritzer 2007 ) and a book entitled Social Science Quotations ( SSQ ) , a supplement of the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences , which has a broad selection of quotations from scholars of authority and consequence ( Sills 11 Historically , Thomson’s ISI citations were gathered under the name of the ( Social ) Science Citation Index . Since the advent of the internet , Thomson has made its citation database accessible online and now the citations are under the label ‘‘ISI Web of Knowledge’’ . Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 917 123 and Merton 2000 ) . We ﬁnd in SSQ quotations from sociology , economics and psychology scholars alike , who not only wrote well but whose ideas also had a formative impact on social thought . In short , the book is about ‘‘memorable ideas memorably expressed’’ ( Sills and Merton 1992 , p . 168 ) . As the major criterion for inclusion is relevance to the social sciences , the number of quotations collected by Robert K . Merton for each scholar can be viewed as another alternative indicator for ‘certiﬁed eminence’ . Elected president / honoriﬁc awards Being elected president of the American Sociological Association ( ASA ) , the American Economic Association ( AEA ) , or the American Psychological Association ( APA ) confers prestige to the scholar and is a clear sign that his or her work has merit . ASA presidents are characterized by distinguished academic records and various publications strategies that include inﬂuential books ( Platt 2016 ) . In economics , the number of journal publications is an important determinant of election ( Diamond and Toth 2007 ) . Another important source of prestige in academia are merit - based awards that are , symbolically , an important part of the academic reward system . We consider the Nobel Prize for economics , the ‘W . E . B . DuBois Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award’ for sociology and the ‘APA Award for Distinguished Scientiﬁc Contributions’ for psychology . Obviously , there is no equivalent to the Noble Prize in the two other disciplines . However , in case of both the DuBois and APA awards , it might be said that the awarding committees established an elaborate system to ensure that the award goes only to deserving scholars . Similarly to the Noble Prize , being a recipient of these awards is likely to become a central part of any academic biography ( Table 2 ) . Results Agreement and disagreement on scientiﬁc eminence between textbook authors We start our analysis by ﬁrst asking whether there is substantial agreement between textbook authors as to whom to reference . In a sense , these references mirror the judgment of each textbook author as to how to evaluate contributions of a given author relative to the perceived merit of all other fellow scientists mentioned . Authors are very likely to vary the number of references to mentioned scholars such that , in the ﬁnal analysis , citation counts are not so different from expert ratings of eminence . Therefore it seems reasonable to apply standard measures of ‘inter - rater reliability’ . To do this , we used different data matrices . First we applied Cohen’s kappa to a matrix in which columns represent the different textbook authors ( ‘raters’ ) and rows represent the selected eminent scholars ( ‘items’ ) . The cells in the matrix contain zeros and ones indi - cating whether or not an eminent scholar appears in the subject index of a given textbook . The resulting Cohen’s kappa ( see Table 1 ) are very low and , in most cases , negative . Such negative numbers are usually found only in randomly collected data . To reﬁne the analysis , we scaled citations for each textbook individually to values between 0 and 1 and categorized each entry as belonging to three categories : low ; middle ; and high . 12 This procedure takes into account that some authors cite more than others and 12 The three categories created are [ - ? , x [ 25 ] ] , ] x [ 25 ] , x [ 75 ] ] , ] x [ 75 ] , ? ? ] ; where x [ 25 ] and x [ 70 ] are the 25th and 75 percentile of references in the respective index for the 1970s and 2010s . 918 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 builds on the simple assumption that references to authors can be transformed into prestige ratings on a scale with three reference points only . Applying Krippendorf’s alpha ( see Table 1 ) to this , ordinal metrics once again reveal poor agreement between textbook authors . 13 OneshouldbeawarethatCohens’skappaand Krippensdorf’salphaareglobalmeasuresthat consider all ‘raters’ and all ‘rated’ scholars , thereby masking many trends within the data matrices . By visualizing the data matrices with so called ‘‘heatmaps’’—that apply color - coding to the three - category scale—many consistent trends become apparent ( see Appendix ) . The heatmaps in Appendix A2 are structured in a way that considers the number of high , middle and low page counts ( in descending order ) by scholars across all ﬁve text - books . Authors who do not differ on one of these three criterions are alphabetically ordered . For all three disciplines , we observed that there was a small ‘core’ of top scholars that all introductory text authors deem essential to reference ( upper rows ) . Further , there is substantial agreement with regard to those authors whose work seems to be judged as less relevant to the discipline ( lower rows ) . It is only between these two poles that we see substantial disagreement about who should receive more references . There are , however , also substantial differences between disciplines . In sociology , the consolidation of the core - periphery - structure seems to advance the most between 1970 and 2010 . While all textbook authors seem to arrive at agreement over who to cite most , the number of scholars in the ‘periphery’ grows considerably . Similar trends become visible for economics , although they are less pronounced . In psychology , the top comprises considerably more scholars than in sociology , but crystallizes similarly over time . Overall , the visualizations unearth hidden order in the data and ‘rating’ consistencies between at least two or three textbook authors . Textbooks , ‘normal’ ( social ) science and lasting eminence Following Kuhn , textbooks have been designed to perpetuate normal ( social ) science , which means that they are written in accord with the principles of the dominant paradigms of the day . Being such a pedagogical device , textbooks are likely to be rewritten , in whole or in part , whenever the language , problem - structure or dominant perspectives in the discipline change . If there is development of knowledge , scientiﬁc advances are most likely to be made by new generations of scholars . What can we infer from textbooks about the rate at which rising scholars displace those already established ? Figure 1 shows that , for the 1970s , the median birth year of all considered scholars varies only marginally across all three disciplines ; it is approximately 1900 . In 2010 , the picture changes considerably . In psychology , textbook authors reference the work of a large number of authors born in the 1940s or later . The median in economics rises to about 1930 . It is in sociology that we see the least change ; only two of the most referenced scholars are born after 1950 compared to nine in economics and 22 in psychology . The heatmaps ( see Appendix ) also reveal that textbook eminence is not set in stone , only a fraction of authors ‘survive’ in the list from 1970 to 2010 . 14 In sociology 26 ( 29 % ) names occur in both the 1970 and 2010 samples , 16 in economics ( 35 % ) and also 16 in psychology ( 17 % ) . The group of scholars whose ‘fame’ endures appears quite diverse , at least at face value . In all three disciplines , we can identify ‘‘founding fathers’’ ( Baehr and O’Brien 1994 ) such 13 a = 1 indicates perfect reliability and a = 0 indicates the absence of reliability . 14 The names of the ‘surviving’ authors are given in capitalized letters in all heatmaps ( Appendix A2 ) . Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 919 123 as Durkheim or Weber in sociology , Ebbinghaus or Watson in psychology , and Smith or Ricardo in economics . Textbook authors seem to agree that these scholars have contributed formative ideas in their respective disciplines . Equally we encounter ‘‘classics’’—such as Parsons , Schumpeter or Ash—most likely because textbook authors are of the opinion that students can learn as much from this earlier work as they can from contemporary contributions . Finally , it appears that in each discipline those scholars that pioneered a research ﬁeld ‘survive’ : in sociology , Davis established social demography as a formally organized subﬁeld ; in psychology , Skinner developed behaviorism ; Nash laid the groundwork for the cooperative bargaining theory ( ‘‘Nash equilibria’’ ) . Thus when one takes the data at face value , there are only small differences between disciplines . Looking more deeply , how - ever , reveals different factors that foster lasting eminence in the three disciplines . Figure 2 presents average marginal effects ( AMEs ) derived from a logistic regression . 15 Given the high uncertainty of all estimates , there are only few conclusions that can be drawn . First , the variable ‘born after 1900’ has a signiﬁcant negative impact on the probability of ‘surviving’ in sociology , ﬁndings that resonate with Fig . 1 . Scholars born between 1800 and 1900 such as Comte , Marx or Durkheim—continue to play a central role . Robert Michels is a rare example of a 19th century scholar who vanishes from the list ( see Appendix ) . Scientiﬁc recognition—such as the ASA presidency or the W . E . B . DuBois Career Award—are the best predictors for lasting eminence in sociology . Having more than ﬁve quotations included in SSQ also relates positively to ‘survival’ in sociology . In economics , eponyms turn out to be the only reliable predictor , suggesting that eponyms are terms that perpetuate an original thinker in economics . As with sociology , above average quotations in SSQ indicate enduring importance in psychology . Being dedicated an Encyclopedia Britannica entry is also an important pre - dictor . It is interesting to note that an APA presidency or the APA award does not make much difference in psychology . 15 The average marginal effects ( AMEs ) presented are not only comparable across logistic models but also substantively more meaningful than simple coefﬁcients or odds ratios . AMEs measure the change in the expected probability of y ( that is , surviving in the list ) as one independent variables increases by unity while all other variables are kept constant .

Notes The middle bar is the 50 % percentile , the bottom and top of the box are the 25 and 75 % percentiles 920 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 Overall , the determinants of lasting eminence in textbooks vary across disciplines . While in sociology and psychology lasting eminence is reserved for those who ‘‘memo - rably expressed memorable ideas , ’’ in economics it is models and theories named after their discoverer ( e . g . ‘Phillips curve’ ) that make eminence robust . Correlates of textbook references In order to explore the most important correlates of textbook references , several inter - correlations are explored in a basic correlation matrix . The last row in Fig . 3 presents correlations between the textbook page count and eight other variables . As can be seen from the matrix , the correlation with the number of quotations in SSQ is the highest in all three disciplines . In psychology , the correlation is as high as 0 . 8 , suggesting that the two variables measure very similar concepts . Further , we can see that for sociology and psy - chology , the textbook page count relates to Google Scholar citation measures ( h - index , number of total citations ) . For economics , however , the correlation with the h - index is so low that one has to conclude that there is no substantive overlap . If one looks at indicators of certiﬁed eminence such as number of eponyms or ency - clopedia entries , similar correlations of between 0 . 3 and 0 . 4 in all disciplines can be seen . In contrast , indicators of institutionalized merit - based academic prestige—such as the presidency of the ASA , AEA or APA—are loosely associated with our indicator for textbook eminence . Perhaps the most striking result is that in economics textbook eminence and the sci - entiﬁc productivity and impact of a researcher as measured by the h - index is unrelated . To explore this in more depth , Fig . 4 presents a simple two - way scatterplot with each dot standing for a scholar born after 1900 . To give some examples : Milton Friedman and Paul A . Samuelson are the only economists who exhibit both a large textbook page count and a high Google Scholar - based h - index in both the 1970 and 2010 textbook sample . Most other economists score high on one or other dimension , not on both . The Nobel prizewinners Joseph Stiglitz or Paul Krugman , for example , have h - indexes above 140 but are men - tioned in less than 10 textbook pages . In contrast , central bankers—such as Paul Volcker or Fig . 2 Predictors for ‘surviving’ between the 1970s and 2010s , AMEs from logistic regression . Notes Crosshairs showing 95 % conﬁdence intervals Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 921 123 Alan Greenspan—are mentioned on more than 10 pages , while having a comparatively low h - index . In sociology , there are multiple people—such as Merton , Parsons , Foucault , Berger or Goffman—who score extremely high on both dimensions . Their exceptionally high h - in - dex is partly explained by the broad reception of their work in several academic disci - plines . Seligman or Plomin are examples of productive psychologists who are much cited in the ‘‘journal world’’ and whose work also ﬁnds recognition in introductory textbooks . If we concentrate purely on the larger patterns , in each discipline we see a pronounced concentration around median values on both axes . The overall association in economics appears extremely weak . Fig . 3 Correlates of textbook references ( correlation matrix ) . Notes All values in the correlation matrices are Pearson correlation coefﬁcients Fig . 4 Scatter plot of textbook references and Google scholar h - indexes ( 20th century scholars only ) . Note Dashed line indicates the median 922 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 Quantity as inﬂuence on textbook eminence The question of how productivity relates to textbook eminence is one that needs further analysis . There is a longstanding belief , especially in economics and psychology , that if you want to get ahead you must churn out an endless stream of articles . Creativity researchers argue that quantity may in fact be a necessary condition for quality as whoever produces many ideas , both good and bad , is likely to hit on ideas of great impact ( Simonton 1989 ) . In psychology , there is empirical evidence that quantity and impact are moderately positively related ( Feist 1997 ) . What we will examine below is to what extent the number of different publications by the same scholar relates positively to textbook eminence . Figure 5 visualizes , for each sampled scholar , the number of different publications referenced across the ﬁve sampled textbooks . At the upper end of the three discipline - speciﬁc distributions we ﬁnd scholars such as Immanuel Wallerstein , Milton Friedman or Robert Plomin , and at the lower end Karl Marx , Irving Fisher and Carl Gustav Jung . The distributions are quite distinctive . In sociology , between three and seven publications are cited in the 1970s and 2010s for the bulk of authors . In economics , this is one or two cited publications . Only in psychology do we see shifting citation patterns across years . While in the 1970s , textbook authors frequently cited only one publication per author—as in the case for Kurt Lewin , Jean Piaget or Kurt Koffka—this tendency completely disappeared , with citations of 20 or more publications per author now commonly observed , as in the case of Roy Baumeister or Ronald C . Kessler . Overall , one can conclude from Fig . 5 that producing large quantities of work relates positively to textbook eminence in psychology , while such a relation is moderate for sociology and does not exist at all in ‘textbook economics’ . Such a conclusion agrees with previous results that conﬁrmed a positive relation between ( Google Scholar ) h - indices and textbook eminence in psychology , while such an association is not observed in economics ( see Fig . 4 ) . Fig . 5 Number of different publications referenced by author Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 923 123 Conclusions This article set out to answer two questions : What does it take to attain eminence in textbooks ? And is textbook eminence enduring or ephemeral ? In attempting to answer the ﬁrst question , we discovered that different indicators of what we called ‘certiﬁed eminence’ principally relate to the number of pages on which a scholar is referenced . Across all three disciplines , quotations by scholars cited in the encyclopedia Social Science Quotations . Who said What , When and Where ( SSQ ) were the key correlate of textbook eminence . The editors of SSQ included authors who were con - sequential and memorable insofar as they ‘‘have been quoted over the generations , entering into the collective memory of social scientists and at times diffusing into popular thought’’ ( Sills and Merton 2000 , p . xvi ) . Eponyms , and entries in the encyclopedia Britannica , show similar associational meanings . However , it was also demonstrated that textbook eminence is to some degree ‘manu - factured’ differently across disciplines . The quantity and impact of research , as measured by the Google Scholar h - index , relates positively to textbook eminence in psychology , less so in sociology and not all in economics . Reading psychology textbooks , it becomes obvious that psychologists give great weight to the testing of theories . Textbook authors , it seems , need to not only introduce students to theories , but also to the results of empirical studies that buttress inferences from the observed to the unobserved . In psychology , textbook eminence is the least limited to classical ﬁgures , but also includes very productive scholars born after 1950 who consistently provide evidence from their highly specialized research and publish many high - impact studies . Examples of such psychologists with high h - indexes are Terrie Edith Mofﬁtt , who pioneered research on antisocial behavior , or Richard J . Davidson , best known for his work on the neurobiology of emotion . Because they aim to introduce students not only to the ‘core’ of the discipline but also to different empirical studies at the ‘research frontier’ ( Cole 1983 ) , psychology textbooks are distinct in the ﬁeld . In sociology , the need to show that a theory can accommodate a set of data is less prevalent ; it is , however , the professional standard to trace ideas back to the original source . As these sources are mostly inﬂuential book publications , the ‘textbook world , ’ and the world that Google Scholar captures , overlap to some degree . Neither applies to eco - nomics textbooks . Apparently , empirical studies are not cited in textbooks to evaluate the usefulness of economic models which are , in essence , simpliﬁcations designed to show speciﬁc mechanisms at work by isolating them from other effects ( e . g . Cobb – Douglas model of production ) . While the original ‘modeler’ rarely falls into oblivion , readers are not referred to the original paper that ﬁrst presented a given model ( e . g . Cobb and Douglas 1928 ) . The different epistemological styles adopted when writing textbooks in different disciplines complicate cross - disciplinary comparisons . In attempting to answer the second question , it transpired that textbook eminence is , in general , short - lived . As the zeitgeist moves on , most of the leading scholars of their time come to have only a marginal presence in contemporary textbooks ; Seymour Lipset and William Lloyd Warner in sociology or Joy Paul Guilford or Donald O . Hebb in psy - chology , for example . On the other hand , for each discipline we identify about twenty scholars who remain , e . g . Max Weber , Adam Smith and John M . Keynes . If in a world where all atoms have a natural decay time , these scholars appear to never fall into oblivion . Interestingly , we do not always observe that a new generation of eminent scholars takes the place of the older one . Sociology textbooks still draw overwhelmingly on knowledge 924 Scientometrics ( 2018 ) 116 : 909 – 939 123 that was produced by scholars more than half a century ago or earlier , which presents a paradox ; we currently have data about social life at a level undreamed of a 100 years ago , yet the foundational approaches to social life are little different from those of a century ago ( Abbott 2006 ) . Clearly , there is a different pace of accumulation of ‘certiﬁed knowledge’ in sociology compared to economics or psychology . Whether the mountain of key soci - ological ﬁndings is growing slowly in sociology , or whether the certiﬁcation process in sociology takes longer than in other disciplines , is a worthwhile question for future research . Limitations and future directions It is a limitation of this study that textbook eminence is measured by examining textbooks published 40 years apart and is thus somewhat imprecise . To determine a scholar’s ‘half - life’ , requires a more ﬁne - grained research design that would allow the study of multiple generations of textbooks . Such large - scale research would most likely be able to detect small differences in the average ‘half - life’ of textbook eminence , shed light on the different ‘expiration histories’ of scholarly recognition and understand how textbook writing has changed over time in each discipline .
