Modulation of membrane trafﬁc by mechanical stimuli . Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 282 : F179 – F190 , 2002 . —All cells experience and respond to mechanical stimuli , such as changes in plasma membrane tension , shear stress , hydrostatic pressure , and compression . This review is an examination of the changes in mem - brane trafﬁc that occur in response to mechanical forces . The plasma membrane has an associated tension that modulates both exocytosis and endocytosis . As membrane tension increases , exocytosis is stim - ulated , which acts to decrease membrane tension . In contrast , in - creased membrane tension slows endocytosis , whereas decreased ten - sion stimulates internalization . In most cases , secretion is stimulated by external mechanical stimuli . However , in some cells mechanical forces block secretion . External stimuli also enhance membrane and ﬂuid endocytosis in several cell types . Transduction of mechanical stimuli into changes in exocytosis / endocytosis may involve the cyto - skeleton , stretch - activated channels , integrins , phospholipases , ty - rosine kinases , and cAMP . membrane tension ; stretch ; mechanical forces ; exocytosis ; endocytosis ; secretion ; cytoskeleton ; mechanosensors ; signal transduction ALL CELLS , WHETHER INDIVIDUALLY or in a tissue , experi - ence and respond to intracellular and extracellular mechanical stimuli ( 43 ) . Cell - associated forces in - clude osmotic pressure and the forces generated by the cytoskeleton as it pushes and pulls against the plasma membrane and the intracellular organelles ( 58 ) . External forces can be static , incremental , or cyclical and include hydrostatic pressure , shear stress , twisting , compression , and high - frequency vi - brations ( 5 ) . The cell responds to these stimuli by modifying its rate of division , death , differentiation , movement , signal transduction , gene expression , se - cretion , and endocytosis ( 6 , 7 , 21 , 24 , 27 , 43 , 62 , 84 , 107 ) . The effects of mechanical forces on cell growth , signal transduction , gene expression , and ion trans - port have been the focus of several recent reviews ( 24 , 27 , 43 , 107 ) . This review is an examination of how endomembranous trafﬁc is modulated by me - chanical stimuli . ENDOCYTOSIS , EXOCYTOSIS , AND PLASMA MEMBRANE TENSION Endocytosis is a diverse set of processes whereby patches of membrane are invaginated and budded off of specialized domains of the plasma membrane ( 87 ) . A small amount of ﬂuid is trapped in the forming endo - cytic vesicles . Types of endocytosis include clathrin dependent ( also known as receptor - mediated endocyto - sis ) , caveolar dependent , non - clathrin dependent , mac - ropinocytosis , and phagocytosis ( 87 ) . Endocytosed ma - terial is delivered to endosomes and can be recycled back to the plasma membrane , delivered to the trans - Golgi network , sent to lysosomes ( where it is de - graded ) , or in polarized epithelial cells it can be deliv - ered to the opposite cell surface in a process termed transcytosis ( 87 ) . In exocytosis , intracellular vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane , delivering vesicle membrane proteins and releasing secretory cargo in the process ( 48 ) . Exocytic vesicles come in the form of constitutive cargo released from the Golgi , or special - ized secretory vesicles that are also formed at the Golgi but fuse with the plasma membrane in response to external stimuli .

Plasma Membrane Tension One intrinsic feature of the plasma membrane is its associated membrane tension ( 21 , 84 ) . As will be de - scribed below , plasma membrane tension has a signif - icant impact on exocytosis and endocytosis . For a sim - ple thin - walled sphere , Laplace’s law deﬁnes the in - plane tension as tension (cid:1) 1 ⁄ 2 ( pressure ) (cid:2) ( radius of curvature ) . The in - plane tension of a cell’s plasma membrane is more complicated to discern as the plasma membrane is attached to the underlying cy - toskeleton , and this adhesion contributes signiﬁcantly to the apparent membrane tension ( 115 ) . Other factors affecting plasma membrane tension include hydro - static pressure across the membrane and effects due to local membrane curvature ( e . g . , regions of membrane associated with microvilli ) ( 115 ) . Previously , mechanical deformation was used to study the physical nature of the plasma membrane ( 20 ) . A newer technique employs laser tweezers ( see Fig . 1 ) ( 120 ) . In these studies , antibody - , lectin - , or extracellular matrix - coated latex beads are allowed to bind to the plasma membrane . The bead is trapped by a laser tweezer , a device that depends on the small pressure generated as focused laser light refracts through the transparent bead , pushing the bead to - ward the focal point of the laser light . The trapped bead and the cell are pulled from one another at a constant velocity by a motorized stage , whereby the attached membrane is pulled into a thin long mem - brane tether that remains cell associated but is free of cytoskeletal attachment . The in - plane membrane ten - sion , bending stiffness of the membrane , and cytoskel - etal adhesion all act to pull the membrane tether back onto the cell ( 20 , 120 ) . In doing so , a tether force is generated that can be calculated by measuring the displacement of the bead in the laser trap . The bending stiffness of the membrane is thought to be relatively constant as is the in - plane membrane tension . Under most conditions , changes in tethering force are thought to result from changes in membrane - cytoskeleton at - tachment ( 9 , 21 ) . Membrane tension , which can be calculated from the tether force , is (cid:3) 0 . 02 – 0 . 12 mN / m across all regions of the plasma membrane ( 22 , 23 , 62 , 84 , 95 ) . The plasma membrane is largely inelastic and can increase in area only 2 – 3 % before rupture occurs ( lytic tensions are in the range of 1 – 12 mN / m ) ( 21 , 84 ) . When plant or animal cells are placed in hypotonic medium , which induces cell swelling , the plasma membrane tension rises dramatically and then settles at a new but higher steady - state level ( 20 , 22 , 62 ) . In some cell types , unfolding of surface membrane specializations ( e . g . , membrane folds and microvilli ) can accommodate some of this cell expansion ( 94 , 118 , 121 ) . However , in cells that either lack these reserves of plasma mem - brane or deplete them , cell swelling is accompanied by a rise in capacitance ( a measure of membrane surface area where 1 (cid:4) F (cid:5) 0 . 5 – 1 cm 2 of surface area ) and cell volume ( 22 , 54 ) . The increase in capacitance is the result of exocytosis , which acts to decrease plasma membrane tension . In general , increases in plasma membrane tension are followed by increases in exocy - tosis ( 43 , 84 ) ; however , this is not always the case ( see the discussion below ) . In the case of guard cell proto - plasts , the changes in capacitance occur in a stair - step manner , which may reﬂect the fusion of discrete pack - ets of exocytic cargo ( 55 ) . When the cells are returned Fig . 1 . Use of laser tweezers to probe plasma membrane tension . An antibody - , lectin - , or extracellular matrix - coated bead is bound to the plasma membrane of the cell . The bead is trapped by a laser tweezer and then pulled away from the cell at a constant velocity by a mechanical stage . Attached to the bead is a thin membrane tether that remains associated with the plasma membrane but is free of the cytoskeleton . The in - plane membrane tension , bending stiffness of the membrane , and cytoskeleton attachment pull the bead toward the cell and contribute to the tether force . The tether force is calculated by measuring the displacement of the bead from the center of the laser ( (cid:6) d ) and calibration of the trap . An apparent membrane tension can be calculated from the tether force ( 116 ) . The ﬁgure is redrawn from Ref . 116 .

In addition to modulating exocytosis , membrane ten - sion may also regulate endocytosis . In rat basophilic leukemia cells , stimulation of secretion is associated with a decrease in membrane tension ( the result of secretory vesicle exocytosis ) , which is followed by a rapid rise in endocytosis ( 23 ) . In Hela cells , membrane tension increases during mitosis , and endocytosis is inhibited in this phase of the cell cycle ( 95 ) . This inhibition was previously ascribed to cell cycle - depen - dent modulation of endocytic machinery , e . g . , phos - phorylation of regulatory Rab proteins ( 3 ) . Interest - ingly , treatment of mitotic cells with agents that decrease membrane tension ( DMSO , deoxycholic acid , or ethanol ) causes a rapid rise in the endocytic rate ( 95 ) . These and other observations have led to the hypothesis that tension , which is dependent on mem - brane trafﬁc and membrane - cytoskeleton adhesion , regulates the rate of endocytosis ( 23 , 62 , 84 , 95 , 115 , 138 ) . The underlying mechanism of how tension regu - lates endocytosis is unknown , but it may reﬂect the physical nature of the endocytic process . Endocytosis requires deformation of the membrane and detach - ment of membrane from the cortical cytoskeleton . This process is similar to tether formation ( 115 ) . When membrane tension is high it would counteract the force necessary to deform the membrane and decrease endo - cytic rate ( 115 ) . By adding or removing plasma membrane , exocyto - sis and endocytosis act to modulate plasma membrane tension . Moreover , exocytosis and endocytosis can be accompanied by local changes in the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( 2 , 130 ) . Because membrane tension is dependent on cytoskeleton - membrane adhesion , these changes may signiﬁcantly impact membrane tension . How the cell senses membrane tension or determines its set point is presently unknown . Nor is it understood how alterations in the set point are transduced into changes in membrane trafﬁc . Possible mechanosensors and mechanotransduction pathways are described at the end of this review . MECHANICAL STIMULATION OF SECRETION Experimental Simulation of Mechanical Stimuli Experimental manipulations that mechanically de - form cells cause changes in plasma membrane tension and alter secretion . In addition to osmotic stretch de - scribed above , other techniques used to mimic physio - logically relevant mechanical stimuli include passing ﬂuid over cells plated on solid supports ( e . g . , cultured endothelial cells ) , which generates shear stress , or passing ﬂuid through a tubule ( e . g . , an isolated nephron segment ) , which generates both hydrostatic pressure and shear stress ( see Table 1 for use of these methods ) . Alternatively , cells ( e . g . , cardiac myocytes ) are grown on ﬂexible supports such as silicone and then subjected to cyclical distension by a vacuum pulled under the support ﬁlm and then released ( Table 1 ) . This technique can be mechanized and computer controlled . Lung cells can be grown in foam matrices and these organotypic cultures are then mechanically elongated by a computer - controlled stretching device ( Table 1 ) . A summary of these and other methods can be found in a recent review by Brown ( 12 ) . Stimulation of Exocytic Trafﬁc by Mechanical Stimuli When cells are exposed to various mechanical ma - nipulations , exocytic trafﬁc is stimulated in several systems , including adult and fetal lung cells , endothe - lial cells , cardiac myocytes , smooth muscle cells , skeletal muscle cells , kidney mesangial cells , kidney tubular epithelial cells , astrocytes , bladder umbrella cells , ﬁbroblasts , plant guard cells , mammary gland cells , neuronal cells , osteocytes , pleural mesothelial cells , retinal pigment epithelial cells , and toad bladder cells ( see Table 1 for details ) . Stimulated secretion of extra - cellular matrix proteins , surfactant proteolipid , pro - teinases , growth factors such as platelet - derived growth factor , nerve growth factor and transforming growth factor - (cid:7) , and hormones such as atrial natri - uretic factor ( ANF ) , angiotensin II , and endothelin 1 is observed in stretched cells ( Table 1 ) . Moreover , stretch stimulates the release of small molecules such as ATP , prostacyclin , nitric oxide ( NO ) , and the cytosolic basic ﬁbroblast growth factor , which is se - creted by a nonclassic secretory pathway ( Table 1 ) . Secretion of angiotensin II is stimulated within 1 min of the introduction of the mechanical force ( 108 , 110 ) , whereas in other cases stimulation is observed after several hours of force application ( 75 , 77 , 91 , 113 , 127 , 129 , 134 ) . In the latter case , it is likely that the observed effects reﬂect stretch - regulated en - hancement of gene expression and may not represent direct effects on membrane trafﬁc . Inhibition of Exocytic Trafﬁc by Mechanical Stimuli Although increased membrane tension stimulates exocytosis in many cells , inﬂation of mast cells ( to 4 times their resting volume ) prevents degranulation ( 118 ) , and secretion of renin by juxtaglomerular cells and production of gelatinases by mesangial cells are inhibited by mechanical stretch ( 4 , 15 , 33 , 142 ) . Also , hypotonic swelling of Hela or COS cells causes a block in anterograde transport of cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi ( 71 ) . The underlying mechanism of this block is unclear , but it may reﬂect a disruption in COPI coat function . In contrast , retrograde trans - port ( between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticu - lum ) is not blocked in these cells and as a result the Golgi collapses into the endoplasmic reticulum . Sur - prisingly , the Golgi reappears after 3 – 6 h , and this reappearance requires a protein kinase C ( PKC ) - de - pendent pathway . Because recovery does not require protein synthesis , it is thought that PKC may play a role in activating a volume - recovery mechanism that facilitates Golgi reassembly . Apparently , treatments that seemingly would increase membrane tension do not always lead to increases in exocytic trafﬁc . This could reﬂect the specialized physiology of certain cell F181 INVITED REVIEW AJP - Renal Physiol • VOL 282 • FEBRUARY 2002 • www . ajprenal . org on J u l y 10 , 2010 a j p r ena l . ph ys i o l og y . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m types or differences in how each cell type responds to alterations in tension set point . Because the cell has multiple pathways for exocytosis , it is also possible that these pathways are differentially affected by changes in plasma membrane tension . Transport Steps Altered by Mechanical Forces Although the membrane trafﬁcking step altered by mechanical force is not deﬁned in all systems , it is known in some . In mechanically sensitive neuronal cells ( e . g . , hair cells in the inner ear ) , synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane is stimulated as a result of stretch - induced membrane depolarization ( 34 , 40 , 56 ) . A single cycle of stretch and relaxation is sufﬁcient to promote the exocytosis of lamellar bodies in type II pneumocytes ( 136 ) . These membranous or - ganelles contain whorls of lipid and associated proteins that , when secreted , function to reduce surface tension in the alveoli . When isolated toad bladders are stretched , a large increase in the fusion of subapical secretory granules with the apical plasma membrane of the granular cells is noted ( 11 ) . This leads to a corresponding decrease in the number of secretory granules within the cell . In cardiac myocytes , angio - tensin II is found in dense core granules , as is ANF ( 110 , 126 ) . These cargo vesicles are thought to fuse with the plasma membrane in response to stretch . Umbrella cells , which line the mucosal surface of the mammalian bladder , contain an abundant population of vesicles that , depending on species , have a discoidal or fusiform appearance . It is hypothesized that they fuse with the apical membrane as the bladder ﬁlls , thereby increasing the available surface area of the bladder ( 51 , 73 , 82 ) . Table 1 .

In our own studies , we measured stretch - induced changes in the surface areas associ - ated with discoidal vesicles , the apical plasma mem - brane , or the basolateral plasma membrane ( Truschel S , Wang E , and Apodaca G , unpublished observations ) . Epithelial tissue , dissected of underlying musculature , was placed in a modiﬁed Ussing chamber and then either left unstretched or bowed toward the serosal side by applying hydrostatic force until a pressure of 8 cm H 2 O was generated . Under control unstretched conditions , the membrane surface area per umbrella cell associated with vesicles ( (cid:3) 7 , 200 (cid:4) m 2 ) was about three times that of the apical surface area ( (cid:3) 2 , 900 (cid:4) m 2 ) . The basolateral surface area was (cid:3) 4 , 600 (cid:4) m 2 . After a 5 - h period of stretch , which mimics the long storage phase of bladder ﬁlling , the apical surface area was increased to (cid:3) 4 , 300 (cid:4) m 2 ( an (cid:3) 50 % increase ) , whereas no signiﬁcant change in the basolateral sur - face area was measured . Concordantly , the amount of uroplakin III ( a vesicle membrane protein ) at the api - cal surface increased by (cid:3) 65 % after stretch . The mem - brane area associated with vesicles signiﬁcantly de - creased from (cid:3) 7 , 200 to (cid:3) 1 , 000 (cid:4) m 2 . The magnitude of the loss in vesicle surface area ( (cid:3) 6 , 200 (cid:4) m 2 ) was signiﬁcantly greater than the amount added to the apical membrane ( (cid:3) 1 , 400 (cid:4) m 2 ) . As described below , this is the result of stretch - regulated endocytosis and membrane turnover . MODULATION OF ENDOCYTOSIS BY EXTERNAL MECHANICAL STIMULI Because the plasma membrane’s composition and surface area are regulated by both endocytosis and exocytosis , it is not unexpected that endocytosis would also be affected by mechanical forces . In fact , exposure of cultured endothelial cells to shear stress is sufﬁcient to enhance endocytosis of extracellular ﬂuid - phase markers ( 25 ) , and mechanical forces stimulate endocy - tosis in killiﬁsh epithelial cells and bladder umbrella cells ( 32 ) . Endocytosis in Response to Cell Shrinkage When osmotically swollen cells are returned to isos - motic conditions , they rapidly recover exocytosed mem - brane ( 22 , 55 , 67 , 84 ) . According to the tension hypoth - esis , this would be the consequence of decreased membrane tension ( 23 , 62 , 84 , 95 , 115 , 138 ) . Within minutes of a return to isotonic conditions , tubules are formed that rapidly branch and dilate to form what are called vesicular - like dilations ( VLDs ) ( 22 , 81 , 84 ) . VLDs are observed in several but not all cell types . They form at contacting surfaces , are reversible , and reform at the same locations when cells are exposed to cycles of swelling and shrinking ( 81 , 97 ) . They can be 10 (cid:4) m across and penetrate deep into the cytoplasm , and their cytoplasmic face is associated with actin and spectrin ( 49 , 50 , 81 ) . Treatment with actin - disrupting agents has no effect on VLD formation , implicating some other mechanism in their generation ( perhaps one involving spectrin ) ( 49 , 97 ) . Initially , VLDs are contiguous with the plasma membrane , but they are eventually reabsorbed by endocytosis and formation of intracellular vacuoles ( 81 , 97 ) . VLDs may also play a role in regulatory volume decrease , a process by which some cells recover their original volume after a sudden exposure to hypotonic conditions . When kidney tubule cells derived from the medullary thick ascending limb are exposed to hyposmotic medium , they rapidly swell and then are volume regulated ( 19 ) . This volume reg - ulation is accompanied by the formation of VLDs , pre - sumably as a mechanism to recover surface area and decrease cell volume ( 19 ) . Endocytosis During Development Forces generated during development may also im - pact membrane recovery . During embryogenesis of the killiﬁsh , a cap of epithelial cells on the embryo’s animal pole migrate and cover the embryo to form an envelop - ing layer , which will later form the yolk sac . This enveloping process , termed epiboly , involves morpho - logical transitions that include breaking and forming cell junctions and attendant changes in cell shape . When the apical membrane of the enveloping layer is labeled with ﬂuorescent lipid or lectins , the apical membrane internalizes most rapidly at the sites of cell - cell contact ( 32 ) . Endocytosis in these cells contin - ues in a centripetal fashion so that membrane turnover occurs at the periphery of the cell ﬁrst and then pro - ceeds toward the cell center as development continues . Interestingly , endocytosis at sites of cell - cell contact is also observed when , postepiboly , embryos are sub - jected to mechanical deformation , experimentally in - duced by pressing a slide on the embryo ( 32 ) . Similarly , decreasing the surface tension of Xenopus laevis em - bryos by explanting pieces of epithelial tissue is also accompanied by increased membrane turnover ( 7 , 8 ) . The underlying mechanism of this turnover is un - known ; however , it is likely to reﬂect regulation of plasma membrane tension . Stretch - Regulated Endocytosis in Umbrella Cells A useful model by which to study stretch - regulated endocytosis is the bladder umbrella system described above ( 51 ) . When this system was analyzed , it became apparent that the amount of vesicle - associated mem - brane far exceeded the amount of membrane added to the apical surface during stretch . This led us to exam - ine the hypothesis that stretch stimulates membrane turnover in this system ( Apodaca G , Truschel S , and Wang E , unpublished observations ) . In fact , we ﬁnd that stretch is accompanied by rapid endocytosis ; es - F183 INVITED REVIEW AJP - Renal Physiol • VOL 282 • FEBRUARY 2002 • www . ajprenal . org on J u l y 10 , 2010 a j p r ena l . ph ys i o l og y . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m sentially 100 % of labeled apical membrane proteins is endocytosed within 5 min . It is also observed that ﬁlling excised , but otherwise intact , bladders is sufﬁ - cient to stimulate internalization of ﬂuorescently la - beled lectins . Like the killiﬁsh system described above ( 32 ) , endocytic vesicles are most prominent near the sites of cell - cell contact . Consistent with previous mor - phological observations that vesicle membrane is found in multivesicular bodies and lysosomes ( 93 ) , it is ob - served that the majority of endocytosed membrane is directed to lysosomes , where it is degraded . Although it may seem counterintuitive that exocyto - sis and endocytosis are occurring simultaneously in stretched umbrella cells , exocytosis and endocytosis occur constitutively and simultaneously in all cells , even under resting conditions ( 48 , 87 ) . In synapses , compensatory endocytosis is necessary to recover mem - brane exocytosed as a result of neurotransmission ( 59 ) . Coupled exocytosis - endocytosis may allow the um - brella cell to ﬁne - tune its apical surface area and allow for turnover of membrane already exposed to urine . At ﬁrst glance , the stretch - induced endocytosis observed in the killiﬁsh and umbrella cell models seems incom - patible with the tension hypothesis ; manipulations that are likely to increase surface tension are stimu - lating endocytosis . However , in both cases endocytosis is accompanied by membrane turnover ( i . e . , exocyto - sis ) . Because exocytosis decreases membrane tension , the simultaneous endocytosis would act as a compen - satory mechanism to maintain plasma membrane ten - sion . MECHANOTRANSDUCTION AND REGULATION OF EXOCYTIC AND ENDOCYTIC TRAFFIC One goal of present research is to understand how mechanical forces are sensed by the cell and then transduced into downstream cellular events such as exocytosis . The ﬁrst step in this process is the activa - tion of a mechanosensor that is able to sense changes in membrane tension or alterations in the underlying cytoskeleton . This initial signal is transduced via sec - ondary messenger cascades into downstream cellular events including exocytosis and endocytosis . Several different mechanosensors have been identiﬁed ( 43 , 107 ) . Those that regulate membrane trafﬁc are de - scribed below and are shown in Fig . 2 . It is important to note that a single mechanical stimulus may activate multiple mechanosensors and that each cellular event may be regulated downstream of multiple mech - anosensors ( 43 , 80 , 107 , 108 ) . Alternatively , some mechanosensors may selectively regulate only a subset of downstream events ( 43 , 107 , 109 ) . Role of the Cytoskeleton The cytoskeleton , composed of actin , microtubules , and intermediate ﬁlaments , plays an important role in mechanotransduction ( 43 , 58 , 84 ) . Deformation of the plasma membrane is accompanied by a rapid and global reorganization of the cytoskeleton to counteract the external force . Because the cytoskeleton is at - tached to the plasma membrane , alterations in the cytoskeleton can affect membrane tension and thereby affect membrane trafﬁc ( 21 , 115 ) . Changes in the cy - toskeleton directly alter mechanotransduction by mechanisms involving integrins and stretch - activated ion channels ( 17 , 44 , 135 ) . Both of these mechanosen - sors are attached to the actin cytoskeleton , and disrup - tion of this cytoskeletal interaction can change their activities ( 43 ) . The cytoskeleton performs other func - tions that are important to mechanotransduction . It serves as a scaffolding that coordinates the organiza - tion of signaling complexes , which modulate cellular events like exocytosis - endocytosis ( 58 ) . Additionally , the cytoskeleton ensures efﬁcient transport of mem - branous cargo within the cell , and both exocytosis and endocytosis require access to regions of plasma mem - brane generally free of cortical cytoskeleton ( 2 , 128 ) . It is not surprising , therefore , that exocytosis and endo - cytosis are signiﬁcantly altered by agents that perturb the normal assembly and turnover of the cytoskeleton ( 2 , 130 ) . Role of Ion Channels One class of mechanosensors common to most cells includes stretch - activated and - inactivated ion chan - nels ( 43 ) . Several classes of these channels have been described , including nonselective cation channels , some of which conduct Ca 2 (cid:8) and can induce Ca 2 (cid:8) release from intracellular stores ( 42 , 43 , 45 ) . Increased intracellular Ca 2 (cid:8) triggers exocytosis in many cell types , and entry of Ca 2 (cid:8) through plasma membrane channels can also regulate endocytosis ( 10 , 117 ) . A nonselective cation channel underlies mechanosensory transduction by the hair cell of the inner ear ( 34 , 56 ) . Bending of the stereocilia activates a nonselective cat - ion channel that depolarizes the cell . Concomitant with this depolarization is the activation of voltage - sensi - tive Ca 2 (cid:8) channels that raise intracellular Ca 2 (cid:8) , which in turn stimulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis . More - over , stretch - activated secretion of ANF is blocked by gadolinium , a rare earth metal that inhibits many stretch - activated nonselective cation channels ( 69 ) . Re - cently , a nonselective cation channel was identiﬁed in vertebrates . This protein is called the vanilloid recep - tor - related osmotically activated channel ( VR - OAC ) and , like its OSM - 9 homolog in Caenorhabditis el - egans , is thought to be important in sensing osmotic stretch ( 76 ) . Any role that this channel plays in secre - tion has yet to be deﬁned . Other mechanosensitive channels conduct Cl (cid:9) , K (cid:8) , or Na (cid:8) ( 43 ) . Examples of the latter two include maxi - K channels and the epithelial sodium channel , the activ - ities of which have recently been shown to be upregu - lated in isolated kidney cortical collecting ducts sub - jected to ﬂow stimulation ( 111 , 137 ) . The epithelial sodium channel is homologous to the C . elegans family of degenerin proteins ( mec - 4 , mec - 10 , and deg - 1 ) ( 125 ) . These are thought to form a mechanosensitive ion F184 INVITED REVIEW AJP - Renal Physiol • VOL 282 • FEBRUARY 2002 • www . ajprenal . org on J u l y 10 , 2010 a j p r ena l . ph ys i o l og y . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m channel that , in a larger complex , couples touch sen - sation to neurotransmission ( 125 ) . It remains to be determined whether maxi - K or epithelial sodium chan - nels have any role in mechanotransduction . Finally , stretch - induced ANF secretion also requires the activ - ity of K ATP and Ca 2 (cid:8) channels and is blocked by inhib - itors of these channels ( 63 ) . Role of Integrins Integrins , which link extracellular matrix molecules to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton , are another class of mechanosensors ( 58 ) . Magnetic beads coated with an integrin ligand are capable of transmitting mechanical stress to the underlying cytoskeleton , whereas beads speciﬁc for nonadhesion receptors have no effect ( 131 ) . The (cid:10) - subunit , together with the (cid:7) - sub - unit , speciﬁcally binds extracellular ligands , and the (cid:7) - subunit forms interactions with several molecules , including talin and (cid:10) - actinin ( both of which can inter - act with actin ﬁlaments ) and focal adhesion kinase ( 13 , 58 ) . Focal adhesion kinase , in turn , interacts with a number of additional molecules including pp60 src , Fyn , Grb2 , and phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( 13 , 58 ) . These molecules further modulate other secondary messenger cascades , including those in the p21ras , mitogen - activated protein kinases , Rho / Rac / CDC - 42 , and PKC pathways ( 13 , 58 ) . The Rho family of GTP - ases is of signiﬁcant interest , as members of this family regulate the formation of focal adhesions / focal com - plexes , the organization of the actin cytoskeleton , and exocytosis and endocytosis ( 36 , 98 ) . Of the 20 or more integrins known , approximately half bind to the se - quence Arg - Gly - Asp ( R - G - D in single - letter amino acid code ) ( 105 ) . R - G - D peptide inhibits integrin binding to the extracellular matrix and , in frog skeletal muscle , it inhibits stretch - induced release of neurotransmitters from the motor nerve terminal ( 17 ) . R - G - D peptide also inhibits production of platelet - derived growth factor by smooth muscle cells that have been exposed to cycles of stretch and relaxation ( 135 ) . Fig . 2 .

The receptor tyrosine kinases have transmem - brane domains whereas nonreceptor kinases such as pp60 src are anchored via NH 2 - terminal myristoylation . It is possible that membrane stretch causes a confor - mational change in tyrosine kinases that results in their activation . In cardiac myocytes , stretch leads to an almost instantaneous ( within 5 s ) rise in tyrosine phosphorylation that is followed by a rise in intracel - lular Ca 2 (cid:8) ( 108 ) . The tyrosine kinase inhibitor laven - dustin A inhibits stretch - induced ANF secretion ( 124 ) , implicating tyrosine kinases in the regulation of me - chanical stimuli - induced secretion . Furthermore , stretch - induced secretion of vascular permeability fac - tor in mesangial cells is inhibited by genistein and herbimycin A ( inhibitors of tyrosine kinases ) and a speciﬁc peptide inhibitor of pp60 src ( 38 ) . Mechanical stretch of cardiac myocytes activates phospholipase C ( within 1 min ) ( 108 ) , which in turn generates diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate . DAG activates PKC , a known regulator of endocytic and exocytic trafﬁc ( 14 , 26 , 53 , 85 ) . Inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate promotes Ca 2 (cid:8) release , which stimulates exocytosis in many cell systems ( 10 ) . In fetal lung cells , a mechanical stimulus results in a rapid membrane translocation of pp60 src , where it ac - tivates phospholipase C - (cid:11) ( 78 ) . The subsequent pro - duction of DAG activates PKC . In mechanically stim - ulated cells , phospholipase D generates phosphatidic acid ( 108 ) , which has also been implicated in regulat - ing membrane trafﬁcking events including exocytosis ( 103 ) . Phosphatidic acid can be converted to DAG , which in turn activates PKC signaling pathways ( 31 ) . Role of cAMP The generation of cAMP may also play an important role in mechanotransduction . Mechanical stretch stim - ulates production of cAMP in some cell types including uroepithelium ( 72 , 133 ) ( Apodaca G , Truschel S , and Wang E , unpublished observations ) . Agents that raise cAMP ( e . g . , forskolin ) can have signiﬁcant effects on cellular function including stimulation of exocytic and endocytic trafﬁc ( 29 , 46 , 92 ) . H - 89 , an inhibitor of protein kinase A and the principal downstream target of cAMP , blocks stretch - activated discoidal vesicle exo - cytosis in umbrella cells ( Apodaca G , Truschel S , and Wang E , unpublished observations ) . In contrast , fors - kolin causes a signiﬁcant stimulation of discoidal exo - cytosis even in the absence of stretch . Under these conditions , there is an (cid:3) 120 % increase in apical sur - face area over untreated control cells . Forskolin treat - ment has no effect on endocytosis . This is surprising , as greater degrees of exocytosis would likely decrease membrane tension , and the tension hypothesis pre - dicts that endocytosis would be stimulated ( 23 , 62 , 84 , 95 , 115 , 138 ) . The implication of this ﬁnding will have to await direct measurements of membrane tension under these conditions . Growth Factors , Hormones , and Other Signaling Molecules Finally , mechanical stimuli can also enhance the production and / or secretion of multiple growth factors and hormones ( see Table 1 ) that , in an autocrine - paracrine fashion , can stimulate multiple secondary messenger systems downstream of a stretch response ( 107 , 110 ) . Within 1 min of stretch , angiotensin II is secreted ( 108 , 110 ) . On binding its receptor , it activates numerous downstream signaling pathways including activation of phospholipase C . As described above , the generation of inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate and DAG regulate membrane trafﬁc . Other molecules involved in mechanotransduction include ATP , heterotrimeric G proteins , prostaglandins , and NO . Their roles in this process are described elsewhere ( 24 , 27 , 43 , 107 ) . CONCLUDING COMMENTS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Although it is clear that mechanical stimuli modu - late endomembranous transport , several aspects of this regulation are poorly understood . For example , membrane tension is important , yet it is unclear how the cell determines its set point or how changes in tension are perceived . Exocytosis clearly impacts mem - brane tension , yet there has been little attempt to systematically explore how the various transport steps in the secretory pathway are modulated by mechanical forces . Moreover , it is possible that different types of forces may differentially affect these transport steps . There are few model systems that analyze external force regulation of endocytosis . The umbrella cell model described above is likely to shed light on this area of inquiry . Endocytosis occurs via a number of different pathways , and postendocytic trafﬁc , like se - cretory trafﬁc , involves sequential transport between a variety of compartments . The impact of mechanical stimuli on these different forms of endocytosis and transport steps is largely unexplored . The initial mech - anosensing mechanism for both exocytosis and endocy - tosis remains to be deﬁned in many cell systems and is likely to vary among cell types . Furthermore , the path - ways for signal transduction are only loosely deﬁned , and , in the case of stimulated endocytosis , very little is understood . Finally , the targets of these secondary messenger cascades and their impact on the vesicular trafﬁcking machinery require further inquiry . I thank Drs .
