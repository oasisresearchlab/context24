Gelsolin , an actin - binding protein with capping and severing activities , plays a crucial role in the septic response . We investigated if gelsolin infusion could attenuate neural damage in burned mice . Methods : Mice with 15 % total body surface area burns were injected intravenously with bovine serum albumin as placebo ( 2 mg / kg ) , or with low ( 2 mg / kg ) or high doses ( 20 mg / kg ) of gelsolin . Samples were harvested at 8 , 24 , 48 and 72 hours postburn . The immune function of splenic T cells was analyzed . Cerebral pathology was examined by hematoxylin / eosin staining , while activated glial cells and infiltrating leukocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry . Cerebral cytokine mRNAs were further assessed by quantitative real - time PCR , while apoptosis was evaluated by caspase - 3 . Neural damage was determined using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay of neuron - specific enolase ( NSE ) and soluble protein - 100 ( S - 100 ) . Finally , cerebral phospho - ERK expression was measured by western blot . Results : Gelsolin significantly improved the outcomes of mice following major burns in a dose - dependent manner . The survival rate was improved by high dose gelsolin treatment compared with the placebo group ( 56 . 67 % vs . 30 % ) . Although there was no significant improvement in outcome in mice receiving low dose gelsolin ( 30 % ) , survival time was prolonged against the placebo control ( 43 . 1 ± 4 . 5 h vs . 35 . 5 ± 5 . 0 h ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Burn - induced T cell suppression was greatly alleviated by high dose gelsolin treatment . Concurrently , cerebral abnormalities were greatly ameliorated as shown by reduced NSE and S - 100 content of brain , decreased cytokine mRNA expressions , suppressed microglial activation , and enhanced infiltration of CD11b + and CD45 + cells into the brain . Furthermore , the elevated caspase - 3 activity seen following burn injury was remarkably reduced by high dose gelsolin treatment along with down - regulation of phospho - ERK expression . Conclusion : Exogenous gelsolin infusion improves survival of mice following major burn injury by partially attenuating inflammation and apoptosis in brain , and by enhancing peripheral T lymphocyte function as well . These data suggest a novel and effective strategy to combat excessive neuroinflammation and to preserve cognition in the setting of major burns .

Background Brain is one of the remote organs subjected to injurious effects of severe burns [ 1 ] . Survivors suffering from extensive burn injury present long - term cognitive impairment , including depression , anxiety , post - trau - matic stress disorder [ 2 , 3 ] , and alteration in painful sen - sation as well as sensory sensitivity in later life [ 4 ] . In animal studies , magnetic resonance imaging has identi - fied marked changes in the brain up to 3 days postburn ( pb ) , most notably swelling and lesions [ 5 ] , changes in cerebral blood flow [ 6 ] , dysregulation of glucose meta - bolism [ 7 ] , and disruption of the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) [ 8 , 9 ] . Neuroinflammation is a frequent consequence of sep - sis and septic shock [ 10 ] . Approximately 93 % of burn patients show clinical signs of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome before succumbing to their injuries [ 11 ] , and this syndrome can deteriorate and develop into severe sepsis [ 12 ] . After burn injury , there is a dra - matic increase in proinflammatory cytokines in brain as early as 3 hours ( h ) [ 13 , 14 ] and a compromised BBB leading to a large infiltration of macrophages [ 9 ] . Benefi - cial as well as deleterious effects have been ascribed to immune cells that infiltrate the nervous system after neural injury [ 15 - 19 ] . Despite the correlation between cerebral complications in severe burn victims and mor - tality , burn - induced neuroinflammation continues to be an underestimated entity in critically ill burn patients [ 10 ] . Gelsolin was first described as a ~ 90 kDa cytoplasm actin - binding protein with capping and severing activ - ities [ 20 ] . Further studies have confirmed a secreted gel - solin isoform in blood plasma [ 21 ] . Recent reports have documented that it also participates in the regulation of the systemic immune response . Extracellular gelsolin is involved in host immune recognition of bacterial wall molecules during cell division or attack by immune components , while cytoplasmic gelsolin is necessary for macrophage motility in culture , and its absence is likely to impair recruitment of macrophages to a site of crush injury of sciatic nerve [ 22 ] . In fact , overexpression of gelsolin could alter actin dynamics in Jurkat T cells , cor - relating with inhibition of activation - dependent signaling pathways [ 23 ] . Moreover , cytoplasmic gelsolin depletion is observed in diverse states of inflammation that are associated with tissue injury and actin release , including hemorrhagic shock [ 24 ] , early sepsis , trauma , and rheu - matoid arthritis [ 25 ] . In addition , its deficiency has been found to correlate with septic mortality [ 26 ] and prog - nosis [ 27 ] , suggesting that gelsolin might play a crucial protective role in the course of sepsis . Accordingly , gelsolin replacement might be considered as a potential therapy for the lethal condition of sepsis [ 28 ] . It could solubilize circulating actin aggregates and shift expressed cytokines toward an anti - inflammatory profile [ 28 ] , resulting in a significant reduction of mor - tality in endotoxemic mice . Since gelsolin has been shown to significantly blunt neutrophil recruitment to lungs [ 29 ] and to markedly attenuate vascular perme - ability in burn injury in rats [ 30 ] , we hypothesized that , in severe burn injury of mice , a single dose of gelsolin might attenuate neuroinflammation , which might ulti - mately protect the brain from injurious effects following the acute insult . Methods Animal model of burn injury Male Balb / c mice ( 20 - 25 g , 8 - 9 weeks old , obtained from the Laboratory Animal Institute , Beijing , China ) were anesthetized , and the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the mice were shaved . Mice were secured in a protective template on their backs with an opening corresponding to 15 % of the total body surface area ( TBSA ) , and the exposed skin was immersed in 95°C water for 8 seconds ( s ) . This procedure has been shown to produce a 15 % TBSA full - thickness scald injury . Sham - injured mice were subjected to all of the procedures except that the temperature of the bath was the same as room tempera - ture . Immediately following injury , the mice were dried and allowed to recover under a heating lamp . Both sham - and burn - injured mice received 1 . 0 ml of fluid for resuscitation intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) ( Ringer ’ s solu - tion ) . Animals were then housed in individual cages in a temperature and humidity controlled room with 12 hours ( h ) light and 12 h darkness before being sacri - ficed . All experimental manipulations were undertaken in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , with the approval of the Scientific Investigation Board of the Chinese PLA General Hospital , Beijing , China . Intravenous gelsolin infusion Animals were randomly divided into five groups : intact controls , sham - burn mice , placebo controls that under - went burn injury with an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; Fisher Scientific , Fair Lawn , NJ ) , and burned mice treated with either a low dose ( 2 mg / kg , Gsn - L ) or a high dose ( 20 mg / kg , Gsn - H ) of recom - binant human gelsolin ( Sigma - Aldrich , Shanghai , China ) , according to a previous report [ 31 ] , in 0 . 1 ml of sterile saline via tail vein immediately after burn injury . Then the animals ( 9 - 10 mice per group ) were sacrificed at 8 , 24 , 48 and 72 h postburn ( pb ) . Tissue and plasma samples were collected and stored at - 80°C . Survival rate Survival rates were recorded for the low - or high - dose gelsolin - treated mice ( n = 30 per group ) , the placebo - Zhang et al . Journal of Neuroinflammation 2011 , 8 : 118 http : / / www . jneuroinflammation . com / content / 8 / 1 / 118 Page 2 of 18 treated mice ( n = 30 ) , and the sham - injured mice ( n = 10 ) without further intervention . Differences in survival rates among the groups were analyzed by the Kaplan - Meier method using an SPSS software package . Functions of T lymphocytes Splenic mononuclear cells ( MNC ) were separated by Ficoll - Paque density centrifugation and were cultivated in complete RPMI - 1640 medium in flat - bottomed 96 - well microtitre plates ( 4 × 10 5 cells per well ) stimulated by the T - cell mitogen concanavalin A ( ConA , 5 mg / L ; Sigma ) for 48 h . Cell - free supernatant fractions were col - lected and stored at - 80°C until analysis for IL - 2 by ELISA ( ExCell Biology Inc . , Shanghai , China ) . T cell pro - liferation was examined using a 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) method with absorbance at 450 nm in a multiplate spectrophot - ometer ( Spectra MR ; Dynex , Richfield , MN , USA ) . Tissue preparation for immunostaining Mice ( 3 - 4 per group ) were killed by cervical dislocation and the brains were removed and post - fixed for 24 h in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution , followed by 30 % sucrose in phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) for another 24 - 48 h . Brains were stored at - 80°C until used to prepare frozen sections at 30 μ m thickness . These were serially col - lected in PBS and finally stored in cryoprotectant solu - tion at - 30°C . Some of the brain sections were mounted on lysine - coated slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) Brains from the remaining mice ( 5 - 6 mice per group ) were carefully dissected and collected , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at - 80°C . Different regions ( cortex , hippocampus and striatum ) were used for total RNA extraction using a NucleoSpin ® RNA II Kit ( Macherey - Nagel Inc . , PA , USA ) following the manufac - turer ’ s instructions , and used for cDNA synthesis with Superscript II ( Promega , Beijing , China ) . Real - time PCR amplification was achieved in 25 μ l reaction mixtures containing 5 μ l of cDNA sample , 12 . 5 μ l of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( SYBR green ; Applied Biosystems , Fos - ter City , CA , USA ) and specific primers ( SBS Genetech Co . Ltd , Beijing , China ) . An ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system ( Applied Biosystems ) with SYBR - green fluorescence was used for assay . Cycling conditions were a 10 - min hot start at 95°C followed by 5 cycles of dena - turation steps at 95°C for 40 s , an annealing step at 60° C for 30 s , and an extension temperature at 72°C for 30 s . Each sample was run in triplicate . b - actin was used as housekeeping mRNA to normalize gelsolin transcript abundance . Data were analyzed by using sequence Detector Systems version 2 . 0 software . Each sample was tested in triplicate . The relative con - centration of mRNA was calculated using the formula x = 2 - ΔΔ Ct , where x fold change in the target gene at each detection time , normalized to b - actin and relative to the expression of intact mice [ 32 ] . Immunohistochemistry Sections used for immunocytochemistry were incubated in 0 . 3 % hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) for 10 min , and incubated free - floating in antibodies ( Abs ) of polyclonal anti - mouse ionized calcium - binding adapter molecule 1 ( Iba - 1 , 1 : 1000 ; Wako , Osaka , Japan ) , monoclonal anti - mouse CD11b ( Mac - 1 , 1 : 1000 ; EuroBioScience , Lund , Sweden ) , monoclo - nal anti - mouse CD45 ( 1 : 1000 ; EuroBioScience ) , or rabbit anti - cleaved caspase - 3 ( 1 : 50 ; Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA , USA ) with 3 % normal goat serum , 0 . 05 % Triton - X in PBS , for 24 - 48 h rotating at 4°C . The tissue was then rinsed in PBS and incubated for 1 h in biotinylated anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 200 ; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) , rotat - ing at room temperature . The tissue was then rinsed in PBS and incubated for 1 h in ABC solution ( Vector Laboratories ) . Following incubation , sections were rinsed with PBS for 20 min and were developed by incubating in 0 . 025 % diamino - benzidine ( DAB ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and 0 . 002 % H 2 O 2 in PBS . The DAB reaction was halted using PBS , followed by three 10 - min PBS rinses . Quantification of immunohistochemistry For quantitative image analysis of periventricular immu - nostaining , serial sagittal sections of one hemisphere were collected ( lateral position + 0 . 5 to + 2 . 25 from Bregma ) . Iba - 1 - , CD11b - and CD45 - immunostained pre - parations of sagittal brain sections were evaluated for 4 - 5 animals from each group . For each animal , antigens were detected in 10 parallel sections having a distance of 70 mm from each other and showing both striatum and cortex . All images were acquired on a BX - 61 micro - scope ( Olympus Optical Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) , equipped with a digital camera ( F - View II ; Olympus Optical Co . ) . Quantification of immunoreactive cells within the cortex and the striatum was performed at 40 × magnification by a researcher blinded to the treatment . For each ani - mal , average values from all sections were determined . Neuron - specific enolase ( NSE ) and soluble protein - 100 ( S100 ) detection Brain tissues were weighed and homogenized after addi - tion of 3 ml / g ( 1 : 4 ) saline with protease inhibitor cock - tail ( Applygen Technologies Inc . , Beijing , China ) . The supernatants were collected for NSE and S100 analysis in duplicate using available quantitative ‘ sandwich ’ enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay kits ( Rapidbio , CA , USA ) . Sensitivity of the assays was 1 . 0 pg / ml for S100 and 0 . 1 ng / ml for NSE . Zhang et al . Journal of Neuroinflammation 2011 , 8 : 118 http : / / www . jneuroinflammation . com / content / 8 / 1 / 118 Page 3 of 18 Western blot The dissected brain tissues were collected , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C . Tissue was homoge - nized in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor ( Applygen Technologies Inc . ) . The total amount of protein was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay ( Apply - gen Technologies Inc . ) . Samples ( 100 μ g protein ) were separated by 8 % SDS - PAGE and electroblotted to nitro - cellulose membrane , which were blocked by incubation in 3 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin dissolved in TBS - T ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) . Following transfer , proteins were probed using a rabbit monoclonal phospho - p44 / 42 extracellular regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) ( 1 : 2000 ; Cell Signaling ) in TBS - T . Horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary Ab was used at a 1 : 1000 dilution in TBS - T . After extensive washing , pro - tein bands detected by Abs were visualized by ECL reagent ( Applygen Technologies Inc . ) after exposure on autoradiograph film ( Fuji Film ; Kodak Scientific Imaging Film , Beijing ) . Membranes were then stripped and re - probed with p44 / 42 MAPK ( ERK1 / 2 ) mouse monoclonal Ab ( 1 : 1000 ; Cell Signaling ) to confirm equal protein load - ing . The films were subsequently scanned , and band intensities were quantified using Image software . Assessment of cysteinyl aspartate - specific protease ( caspase ) - 3 activity Caspase - 3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Bio - Vision , Mountain View , CA , USA ) . The brain tissues were lysed in buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 % CHAPS , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM EDTA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and centrifuged at 12 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4°C . After determination of protein concentration by bicinch - oninic acid method ( Applygen Technologies Inc . ) , the cell extract ( 200 μ g of protein ) was added to the assay buffer ( 100 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 % CHAPS , 10 mM DTT , 10 % glycerol , and 2 % ( v / v ) dimethylsulfoxide ) con - taining chromogenic substrates ( 2 mM ) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C . Caspase - 3 activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm using a microplate reader ( Spectra MR ; Dynex , Richfield , MN , USA ) . Determination of plasma gelsolin concentrations At 8 , 24 , 48 and 72 h after burns or sham injury , the animals were anesthetized , and blood obtained by car - diac puncture was placed in a heparinized tube ( n = 6 samples each group per time point ) . The blood was cen - trifuged and plasma gelsolin concentrations were deter - mined in duplicate with a mouse gelsolin ELISA detection kit ( USCN Life , Wuhan , China ) . Statistic analysis All data are expressed as mean ± SD from three or more independent experiments . Statistical comparisons among different groups were done by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Dunnett ’ s multiple compari - son tests using SPSS software ( IBM , Beijing , China ) . Dif - ferences with p < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Results Administration of gelsolin can improve the survival rate of burn mice The survival of gelsolin - treated mice at low ( Gsn - L ) or high doses ( Gsn - H ) , as well as of placebo - treated mice , was assessed over a 168 h period after burn injury ( Fig - ure 1 ) . All the mice exposed to sham injury survived the entire period ( n = 10 ) . Placebo - treated mice had a higher mortality than Gsn - H mice ( 70 % versus 43 . 33 % , p < 0 . 05 ) within 72 h after burn injury , and no further mortality occurred after that observation period . Mean survival time was prolonged in the Gsn - H group ( 51 . 17 ± 4 . 7 h , p = 0 . 0258 versus placebo ) and the Gsn - L group ( 43 . 13 ± 4 . 46 h , p = 0 . 4875 versus placebo ) in comparison with the placebo group ( 35 . 5 ± 4 . 96 h ) . Nevertheless , there was no significant difference in mean survival time between Gsn - L and Gsn - H groups ( P = 0 . 0791 ) . Treatment with gelsolin obviously ameliorated burn - induced brain damage As compared with sham - injured mice ( Figure 2A ) , the brains of mice subjected to thermal injury exhibited typical pathological lesions . There was invasion of dis - persed , or even clustered leukocytes in the cortex Figure 1 Survival rates in burn - injured mice after treatment with exogenous gelsolin at low ( Gsn - L ) or high dose ( Gsn - H ) . There was greater mortality for placebo ( burn , 21 of 30 ) than for Gsn - H - treated ( 13 of 30 ) mice after thermal injury , and survival time was significantly shorter in placebo - injected mice than in Gsn - L or Gsn - H - treated mice .

Concurrently , neurons were shrunken with con - densed nuclei , suggesting an early stage of apoptosis ( Figure 2D ) . As late as 24 h pb , a dispersed infiltration of leukocytes ( Figure 2E ) and even microabscesses ( Fig - ure 2F ) were seen in the cortex of the mice , indicating a progressive infiltration of inflammatory cells in brain over this time period . At 24 h pb , dispersed leukocytes were still observed in the cortex of Gsn - L mice , suggest - ing that treatment with gelsolin at low dose fails to ame - liorate the burn - induced brain injury ( Figure 2G ) . In contrast , administration of gelsolin at high dose could protect the brain from undergoing the pathological changes described above ( Figure 2H ) . Similar results were also obtained for Gsn - H mice at other time points ( data not shown ) .

Zhang et al .

In the worst situation , the lateral ventri - cle was filled with inflammatory exudates at 24 h pb ( Figure 2J ) . Moreover , a few leukocytes were observed to accumulate in the choroid plexus in brain of Gsn - L mice ( Figure 2K ) , but seldom in Gsn - H mice ( Figure 2L ) at 24 h pb . Consistent with the morphological observations , the neural injury markers cerebral S100 and NSE content were reduced by high dose gelsolin treatment at 24 h pb , while these remained at levels similar to control or sham - burned mice at 8 h pb ( Figure 3 ) . It is noteworthy that both S100 and NSE showed a small trend of increase at 48 h pb , which could also be slightly reduced by gelsolin infusion at high dose .

Journal of Neuroinflammation 2011 , 8 : 118 http : / / www . jneuroinflammation . com / content / 8 / 1 / 118 Page 6 of 18 Treatment with gelsolin decreased burn - induced proinflammatory cytokines in the brain To further validate and explore the above findings , we next investigated the time course of mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines by real - time PCR in brain of burned mice . On account of the lack of significant improvement in pathology in Gsn - L mice , only the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brains of Gsn - H mice was determined . Significant reductions in brain levels of early cyto - kines , including IL - 1 b and IL - 6 mRNA expression , and late cytokine high mobility group box - 1 protein ( HMGB1 ) , were found in the gelsolin - treated group compared to the placebo group at all time points ( Figure 4 ) . Most strikingly , IL - 1 b mRNA expression in the pla - cebo mice spiked rapidly , and continued to increase at various time points ( Figure 4A ) . IL - 6 mRNA expression in brain tissue was increased by approximately 1 . 5 - to 2 - fold that of the placebo group compared to normal con - trols following thermal injury ( Figure 4B ) . Gelsolin injection resulted in marked down - regulation of IL - 1 b mRNA expression compared with the placebo group . Similarly , IL - 6 mRNA levels in the brain were sup - pressed by approximately 70 % in the gelsolin - treated group compared with the placebo group , close to that of the sham - injured group ( Figure 4B ) . HMGB1 is a non - histone DNA binding protein that is secreted by activated monocytes and macrophages [ 33 ] , and passively released by necrotic or damaged tissues [ 33 - 35 ] including brain [ 36 ] . Thus , HMGB1 acts as an immediate trigger of inflammation [ 37 ] as well as a late mediator of inflammation [ 33 ] . We found that HMGB1 levels were significantly elevated in the brain at 24 and 48 h pb , while they were markedly decreased by gelsolin treatment at both dosages ( Figure 4C ) . In addition , we did not find changes in IL - 17A or IL - 10 mRNA in the brain tissue , implying that there might be no T cell infiltration in brain secondary to acute burns . Similarly , there was no expression of anti - inflam - matory cytokines , including IL - 10 mRNA , induced by gelsolin infusion ( data not shown ) . Administration of gelsolin suppressed burn - induced microglial activation in the brain Microgliosis is a common feature of central nervous sys - tem ( CNS ) injury and disease , and this involves micro - glial cell division , hypertrophy , and alterations in immunophenotype as well as secretory activity [ 38 ] . The augmented neuroinflammation may lead to dysregula - tion of microglial number and / or microglial activation in the CNS . To test such a hypothesis , we stained microglial populations in brains of burned mice with the microglial marker ( Iba - 1 ) at different intervals . We observed kinetic changes of Iba - 1 - immunoreactive cells in striatum and cortex after thermal injury . In brief , Iba - 1 - immunoreactive cells showed morphological changes and altered immunoreactivity in cortex , stria - tum and CA1 region with time after acute insults , peak - ing at 72 h pb in the striatum region ( Figure 5A ) . Iba - 1 + cells were well ramified in burned mice in contrast with a highly ramified ‘ resting ’ morphology in sham - injured brain ( Figure 5B ) . These alterations might be associated with delayed neuronal death of striatum cells in burned mice . In contrast , gelsolin administration at either dosage could suppress activation of Iba - 1 + microglia in cortex and striatum as exemplified by mice at 72 h pb , correlating with its anti - inflammatory effect in brain ( Figure 5C ) . Taken together , immunohistochemistry analyses revealed enhanced microglial density and activation sta - tus in brain at 72 h pb , implicating delayed activation of microglial proliferation and / or activation responses after thermal injury . Caspase - 3 activation in the brain was inhibited by gelsolin infusion after burn injury Caspase - 3 - positive cells were detected in striatum of burned mice by immunofluorescence ( Figure 6A ) . Immunohistochemistry analysis also verified reduced caspase - 3 - positive cells in both cortex and hippocampus by gelsolin treatment ( Figure 6B ) . To determine if gelso - lin could inhibit caspase - 3 activation in our model , we measured levels of caspase - 3 activity in the brain tissue . We found that there was an approximately 2 - fold increase in caspase - 3 activity in the placebo group in comparison to the sham group at 24 h and 48 h pb . However , at early 8 h and later 72 h time points , there were no marked differences in caspase - 3 activity between the placebo and sham groups . As expected , gel - solin injection either at low or high dosage could reduce the elevated caspase - 3 activity to levels comparable to sham - injured mice at 24 h pb , while at later time points such as 48 h pb , only the high dose of gelsolin could exert a similar effect ( Figure 6C ) . Gelsolin enhanced CD11b and CD45 monocyte / macrophage recruitment into brain following burn injury CD11b is expressed by mature monocytes [ 16 ] and by monocyte - derived microglia - like cells [ 39 ] , and CD45 is a pan - leukocyte marker . Unexpectedly , an increase in absolute numbers of macrophage / microglial cells ( CD11b + CD45 + ) [ 40 ] was found in the gelsolin - treated groups . It is intriguing that numerous CD11b + infiltrat - ing monocytes and resident microglial cells with promi - nent amoeboid morphology were noted in the periventricular regions at 24 h pb ( Figure 7A ) .

Since gelsolin is known as a strong chemoattractant [ 22 ] , we further investigated the invol - vement of gelsolin in the migration of myeloid - origin cells into the brain . To our surprise , the numbers of CD11b + cells were increased in sham and burn - injured groups as late as 72 h pb , implying that activation of CD11b + cells was delayed . By contrast , the number of CD11b + cells was decreased by treatment with gelsolin at both dosages ( Figure 7B ) . However , CD45 + macro - phages accumulated in the perivascular regions at 8 h pb in the Gsn - H group ( Figure 8A ) . At both 8 h and 24 h pb , numbers of CD45 + cells were arrested in the peri - ventricular region by both doses of gelsolin administra - tion with differential effects ( Figure 8B ) . Gelsolin down - regulated burn - mediated ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in brain Western immunoblotting for the active , dually phos - phorylated form of p44 / 42 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ( ERK1 / 2 ) revealed that thermal injury per se resulted in activation of this signal pathway in brain tissue ( Figure 9 ) . An increase in phosphorylation of p44 / 42 MAPK was observed at 8 h pb , and this was remarkably increased at 24 h pb . ERK1 ( 44 kDa ) density of the sham group was 18 , 207 ± 829 , while it reached 25 , 564 ± 914 and 30 , 546 ± 1077 in burned mice at 8 h and 24 h , respectively ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Exogenous infusion of gelsolin could markedly down - regulate ERK1 / 2 phos - phorylation at 24 h pb ( 12 , 883 ± 877 ) . Gelsolin improved the suppressed T lymphocytes functions induced by burn injury As expected , burn injury resulted in dramatic suppres - sion of T cell function , as shown by decreased prolifera - tion ( Figure 10A ) and IL - 2 secretion ( Figure 10B ) , compared with either intact control or sham - burned mice . Although infusion of gelsolin at high dose could partially prevent the decline , gelsolin at low dose failed to exert any effect on T cell function .

We found that in animals receiving gelsolin , there were not dramatic changes in circulating gelsolin concentrations . As exemplified in the Gsn - H group , gelsolin concentra - tions ranged from 851 ± 32 pg / ml at 8 h pb to 844 ± 128 pg / ml at 72 h pb . Baseline values of plasma gelsolin in both the intact control and placebo groups was approximately 1300 pg / ml , and they remained relatively constant at all observed time points ( Table 1 ) . Following burn injury , plasma gelsolin levels dropped rapidly to only 1 / 3 of the sham group within 8 h ( 407 ± 57 versus 1273 ± 145 , P < 0 . 001 ) and remained at low levels for up to 3 days . Although plasma gelsolin levels in the Gsn - H group were almost twice that of the placebo group at most time points , gelsolin administration in both dosages could only prevent part of the reduction in plasma gelsolin levels that accompanied burn injury compared with the sham - burned group . Discussion A successful therapeutic strategy for brain injury should include inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines , promo - tion of anti - inflammatory cytokines , suppression of autoimmunity to CNS antigens and reduction in recruit - ment of inflammatory cells , etc . In the present study , we report protective effects of gelsolin in brain of mice sub - jected to burn injury , characterized by amelioration of pathological lesions and suppression of microglial activa - tion , which might be associated with enhanced recruit - ment of CD11b + as well as CD45 + cells . Likewise , gelsolin could substantially down - regulate the marked expression of both early ( IL - 1 b , IL - 6 ) and late proin - flammatory cytokines ( HMGB1 ) in the brain . In addi - tion , treatment with gelsolin significantly reduced caspase - 3 activity and inhibited ERK phosphorylation in the brain secondary to severe burns . As a 90 kDa protein , it is not likely that gelsolin easily penetrates into brain to perform its effects . Yet a pio - neer study has demonstrated that peripherally expressed plasma gelsolin can affect amyloid - b dynamics in the CNS in two mouse models of Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) [ 41 ] . The authors suggested that one possible clearance mechanism might be via plasma gelsolin entrance into brain parenchyma across the BBB , as reports have indi - cated that the BBB is compromised in mouse models of AD [ 42 ] . Similarly , an increase in the permeability of the BBB is a common event in thermally injured animals [ 8 ] , as also shown in our study by the filling of the lat - eral ventricles with inflammatory exudates , so it is rea - sonable to speculate that intravenous infusion of gelsolin could penetrate the BBB into brain parenchyma to attenuate neuroinflammation . Inflammatory mediators are able to alter cellular metabolism by inducing oxidative stress and mitochon - drial dysfunction [ 43 ] , resulting in pathologic abnormal - ities [ 44 ] . Abnormally high levels of cytokines in brain have been found to correlate with both morbidity and mortality in patients with extensive burn injury . In our study , cerebral IL - 1 b and IL - 6 mRNA were up - regulated around 8 h pb and kept increasing throughout the entire period . It is likely that HMGB1 levels were significantly elevated in brain at both 24 and 48 h pb . Gelsolin treat - ment could significantly reduce expression and release of early as well as late proinflammatory cytokines . This down - regulation of the inflammatory response would lead to less damage and cell loss in the brain , which might , in the future , allow preservation of cognition in patients with severe burn injury . IL - 10 is an immuno - suppressant that is mainly secreted by regulatory T cells . It is well known for its positive effects in cerebral ische - mia in rats [ 45 ] . We did not detect IL - 10 gene expres - sion in brain during the entire observation period , suggesting that administration of gelsolin only inhibits proinflammatory cytokine transcription , without aug - menting expression of anti - inflammatory cytokines . Microglial cells are the primary immune effector cells in brain and play a pivotal role in neuroinflammatory processes associated with a variety of neurological as well as pathological disorders . Microgliosis is a common feature of CNS injury and disease [ 38 ] . Iba - 1 is specifi - cally expressed in microglia and plays an important role in regulation of microglial function . Increased Iba - 1 immunoreactivity is a hallmark of burn - induced inflam - mation . It has been proposed that microglial activation induced by sepsis is involved in the pathogenesis of delirium [ 46 ] . There are no reports to date dealing with direct investigation of the activation of microglia and glial scarring following severe burns . We observed kinetic changes in Iba - 1 + cells in striatum and cortex after thermal injury , indicating a highest level of Figure 9 Gelsolin down - regulates burn - induced phospho - ERK1 / 2 activity in hippocampus .

A number of studies have demonstrated that activated glial cells participate in the degeneration of dopamine neurons [ 47 ] . Our data sug - gest that burn injury per se might result in microgliosis and loss of vulnerable neuronal populations from inflammation - induced cell death . Inflammation and apoptosis are two of the most important underlying causes of septic encephalopathy [ 48 ] . Because local accumulation of cytokines may induce apoptosis and significantly extend the initial injury , we also wanted to clarify whether the ability of gelsolin to down - regulate cytokine signaling could lead to decreased activation of apoptotic proteins in brain . Previous investigations have documented that severe burn injury is associated with a significant increase in apoptosis in remote organs [ 30 , 49 , 50 ] including brain [ 47 ] . A number of markers such as S100B and NSE can serve as general markers of brain injury . Consistent with our observation of morphological improvement , cerebral S100B and NSE levels were diminished by gelsolin infu - sion . Our study further proves that gelsolin administra - tion immediately following burn injury can reduce caspase - 3 activity in brain , confirming a neuroprotective effect of gelsolin . In inflammatory diseases either inside or outside the CNS , communication between the periphery and the brain via humoral and / or neural routes results in central neural changes and related behavioral alterations . Monocytes are circulating antigen - presenting leukocytes that play critical roles in inflammation , T - cell differen - tiation , phagocytosis , and innate immunity [ 51 , 52 ] . Pre - vious studies have reported significant infiltration of activated monocytes into the brain of mice with hepatic inflammation [ 18 ] , stroke [ 19 ] , ischemia - reperfusion [ 15 ] and bacterial meningitis during the post - inflammatory period [ 16 ] . Importantly , these newly recruited mono - cytes became an integral part of the pool of parenchyma microglia and contribute to the clearance of damaged tissue [ 17 ] . CD11b is expressed by mature monocytes [ 16 ] and monocyte - derived microglia - like cells [ 39 ] , whereas CD45 is a pan - leukocyte marker . Resolution of CNS infection is often the result of a balance between immune - mediated pathogen clearance and the deleterious effects of inflammation . Indeed , in a murine model of rabies encephalitis , administration of a sex steroid enhanced permeability of the BBB , promoted immune cell penetration into the CNS , and improved survival [ 53 ] . It has also been reported that gelsolin is necessary for rapid motile responses in cell types involved in stress responses such as hemostasis , inflam - mation and wound healing [ 54 ] . In gelsolin - mutant mice , macrophage motility was impaired and this contri - butes to a reduced inflammatory response [ 54 ] and a reduced capacity to recruit macrophages to the injury site , which in turn , slows the clearance of myelin debris and consequently remyelination [ 22 ] . Consistent with these findings , we noticed that gelsolin infusion could accelerate the recruitment of CD11b + and CD45 + cells into the periventricular region of brain early after burn injury , but could still exert a suppressive effect on their recruitment at 72 h pb , indicating an early recruitment of monocyte / macrophage by gelsolin . The increased penetration of CD11b + cells and the enhanced micro - glial activation in gelsolin - treated animals were found to be associated with down - regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and caspase - 3 activities . Taken together , these results indicate that treatment with gelsolin could ame - liorate inflammatory responses in brain and apoptosis of cerebral cells after burn injury . To elucidate the potential signaling mechanism under - lying gelsolin - mediated neuroprotective activity , we examined expression levels of phospho - ERK in burn mice . Western blotting experiments using anti - phospho - p44 / 42 MAPK ( ERK1 / 2 ) mouse antibodies revealed acti - vation of phospho - ERK in brain following thermal injury , which is consistent with previous reports [ 7 , 13 ] . ERK activation may be downstream of free radicals for - mation , based on the finding that dopaminergic cells exposed to 6 - hydroxydopamine , a reactive oxygen spe - cies generating neurotoxin , exhibit a distinct temporal pattern of ERK1 / 2 activation and caspase - 3 activity [ 55 ] . It has been demonstrated that neurons are damaged fol - lowing prolonged exposure to high concentrations of corticosterone , with activation of p38 MAPK , ERK1 / 2 , and c - jun N - terminal protein kinase 1 [ 56 ] , particularly in chronic inflammatory and immune diseases .

We further found that gelsolin treatment dramatically inhibits expression of phospho - ERK1 / 2 in brain of burned mice . These biochemical results are not in agreement with a previous observation that the neuro - protective effects of estrogen could be attributed to increased phospho - ERK in brain [ 13 ] . However , other authors have reported that administration of neuropro - tective reagents reduces phospho - ERK1 / 2 activity [ 57 , 58 ] , and inhibition of ERK1 / 2 can protect against brain damage resulting from focal cerebral ischemia [ 59 ] . Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that gelso - lin overexpression inhibits ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , nuclear factor of activated T - cell activation , and IL - 2 production [ 23 ] . Thus , the exogenous supply of gelsolin in our experiments might protect the brain from expo - sure to pro - apoptotic stimuli , which in turn might down - regulate ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . Although cerebral complications have been related to increased mortality in severe sepsis [ 60 ] and major burn victims [ 10 ] , attenuation of neuroinflammation might not account for all of the benefit of gelsolin in reducing burn - induced mortality in our study . Considering that burn injury could result in severe suppression of the immune system , which plays an important role in the development of subsequent sepsis , multiple organ failure and even death , we examined the dynamic changes in immune function of splenic T cells as well . We found an immunosuppressive effect involving T cells following burn injury , which is consistent with a previous report of perturbed T cell homeostasis after burn injury [ 61 ] . It was encouraging to find that gelsolin infusion could markedly enhance cell - mediated immunity of splenic T cells , which might also contribute to reduced post - burn mortality . While these studies are intriguing , there are several limitations that should be addressed in future investiga - tions . The first shortcoming is that clinical outcome variables were not obtained . For clinical relevance , multi - organ dysfunction which may be the root cause of burn - induced mortality should be evaluated in further studies . Secondly , neurological outcomes like edema , BBB penetrability and cognitive function were not assessed in the current study . Better understanding of the improvement of neurological outcome with gelsolin may allow an in - depth understanding of the mechan - isms by which gelsolin attenuates the acute response , and to what extent neurological damage contributes to post - burn mortality . Although we initiated this study to observe the acute effects of gelsolin on neuroinflamma - tion following burn injury , it may be possible to solidify our current observations in a further study by also eval - uating the effects of gelsolin on these neurological com - plications which are frequently seen in our clinical patients . Thirdly , with regard to the time - window of gel - solin delivery , intravenous infusion of gelsolin immedi - ately after burn injury resulted in significantly reduced mortality . However , the interventional time could be postponed to later intervals to more closely simulate a clinical setting for this therapeutic strategy . The final , but foremost concern regards the pharmacokinetics of gelsolin in this model . With a half life as long as 2 . 3 days [ 62 ] , a single administration of gelsolin could pro - duce considerably elevated gelsolin levels as early as 8 h and remained high at 72 h pb . As BBB disruption may occur as early as 7 h after burn injury [ 8 ] , while gelsolin might not penetrate the BBB directly within the first hours , and it is reasonable to speculate that gelsolin could breach the BBB to perform its effect directly in the brain at later time points . Nevertheless , the precise mechanism of our observed gelsolin effect on response to thermal injury and immunomodulation in both the brain and the periphery requires further studies . Conclusion Despite these limitations , we conclude that , following severe burn injury in a rodent model , an early , single dose of gelsolin can dramatically reduce mortality by ameliorating cerebral inflammatory lesions and apopto - sis via acceleration of recruitment of monocytes and down - regulation of phospho - ERK1 / 2 expression , and also via improvement of peripheral T cell functions as well . Although further studies are warranted , these find - ings might be of importance in the near future in the development of a safe and effective new therapy aimed at significantly improving the outcome of patients with severe burns .
