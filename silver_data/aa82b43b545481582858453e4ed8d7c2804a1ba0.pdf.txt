Findings : As of March 4 , 2021 , the incidence of COVID - 19 cases among school staff was 13 per 1 , 000 ( N = 7 , 071 school staff ) since the beginning of the pandemic . In a cross - sectional seroprevalence analysis from February 10 to May 15 , 2021 , the adjusted seroprevalence among a sample of school staff ( N = 1 , 556 ) was 2 . 3 % [ 95 % CI : 1 . 6 – 3 . 2 % ] , compared to 2 . 3 % [ 95 % CI : 1 . 7 – 3 . 0 % ] in 1 : 2 age , sex and geographical location ( by postal code ) - matched reference group of blood donors .

However , there are limited school data accounting for asymptomatic cases , particularly late in the 2020 / 21 school year , and in the context of uninterrupted in - person schooling and widespread community transmission . Objectives : To determine the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in a sample of school staff , compared to the community , and to COVID - 19 rates among all students and staff within the same school population . Design : Incident COVID - 19 cases among students and school staff using public health data , with an embedded cross - sectional serosurvey among school staff sampled from February 10 to May 15 , 2021 , comparing to age , sex and geographic location - matched blood donors sampled in January 2021 . Setting : Vancouver School District ( British Columbia , Canada ) from kindergarten to grade 12 . Participants : Active s chool staff enrolled from February 3 to April 23 , 2021 . Main outcome measures : SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in a sample of school staff using spike ( S ) - based testing ( unvaccinated staff ) or N - based serology testing ( vaccinated staff ) . Results : The incidence of COVID - 19 cases among students attending in - person was 9 . 8 per 1 , 000 students during the 2020 / 21 school year ( N = 47 , 280 students ) , and among staff was 13 per 1 , 000 since the beginning of the pandemic ( N = 7 , 071 active school staff ) . In total , 1 , 689 school staff ( 64 % elementary , 28 % secondary , 8 . 3 % school board staff or multiple grades ) completed the questionnaire , 78 . 2 % had classroom responsibilities , and spent a median of 17 . 6 hours in class per week [ IQR : 5 . 0 – 25 hours ] . Although 21 . 5 % ( 363 / 1 , 686 ) reported close contact with a COVID - 19 case , only 1 . 4 % ( 24 / 1688 ) of the school staff reported having had a positive viral nucleic acid test . Of this group , five believed they acquired the infection at school . The adjusted seroprevalence in staff who gave blood ( 1 , 556 / 1 , 689 , 92 . 1 % ) was 2 . 3 % [ 95 % CI : 1 . 6 – 3 . 2 % ] compared to 2 . 3 % [ 95 % CI : 1 . 7 – 3 . 0 % ] in blood donors . Conclusion and relevance : Despite high reported COVID - 19 cases among students and staff , and frequent within - school exposures , we found no detectable increase in seroprevalence among school staff above the community seroprevalence . These findings corroborate claims that , with appropriate mitigation strategies , in - person schooling is not associated with significantly increased risk for school staff . All rights reserved .

Decisions to close schools , motivated by high case mortality in populations , had serious implications for children’s emotional , social , physical and educational outcomes 1 . The risk of secondary SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within schools has been heavily debated . On one hand , viral culture studies suggest that children may be less infectious than adults 2 , contact tracing studies show low rates of in - school transmission 3 - 13 , and surveillance studies demonstrate little increased transmission when schools re - opened 14 - 19 . On the other hand , seroprevalence studies have been conducted to account for asymptomatic transmission , but many studies have reported data early in the pandemic , or in the setting of partial school closure 15 , 20 - 22 . In the spring of 2020 , Public Health authorities in British Columbia ( BC ) ordered a cessation of in - person schooling provincially , with a transition to remote learning from home . Like most of the world , the province went under a nearly complete lockdown between March and early June when most sectors of the economy were paused . While BC reported relatively low community viral transmission early in the first pandemic wave , roughly > 50 times more COVID - 19 cases were reported ( 121 , 762 cases reported in a population of 5 , 017 , 000 ) between July 1 , 2020 and April 23 , 2021 , compared to February to May 2020 . Despite increasing cases in late summer , BC was unique within Canada in that it maintained in - person schooling for the entire duration of the 2020 / 2021 school year starting September 8 , 2020 , except for winter ( December 18 , 2020 to January 4 , 2021 ) and spring ( March 12 to March 29 , 2021 ) breaks . The main goal of this study was to determine the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in school staff in Vancouver public schools during the 2020 / 21 school year . The secondary objectives were to compare the seroprevalence in school staff to a reference population of matched Canadian blood donors , and to report on the incidence of COVID - 19 cases among all students and school staff . We hypothesized that with mitigation measures the occupational risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among school staff would remain low and comparable to the community risk . Methods Study design : The baseline questionnaire and serology data collected among active school staff of the Vancouver School District ( the District ) who are being followed for one year , was used to determine SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence . Seroprevalence in school staff was compared to an age , sex and geographic location - matched sampled of blood donors collected in January 2021 . In addition , we obtained retrospective data on COVID - 19 cases in all staff and students attending the District from Vancouver Coastal Health ( VCH , detailed below ) . Participants : School staff self - enrolled from February 3 to April 23 , 2021 after receiving an introduction email from school principals from the District in early February 2021 , inviting them to register online at : https : / / www . bcchr . ca / COVIDatschools , for both a questionnaire and to provide blood for serology testing . A flyer was posted on the District website , and reminder emails were also sent . Interested participants completed a screener to identify whether they met eligibility criteria . Staff were included if they were a current , full or part - time staff member ( confirmed by District email address ) . Staff who reported being temporary staff , on - leave , or on - call with no reported classroom time were excluded . Informed consent was obtained from all school staff . The study was approved by the University of British Columbia Children’s and Women’s Research Ethics Board ( H20 - 03593 ) . Blood donors were screened prior to donation to ensure they were in good health , including questions about COVID - 19 . People were ineligible to donate blood if they had a recent COVID - 19 infection two weeks after symptoms resolved , or were hospitalized within 3 weeks before . All rights reserved .

Following a complete closure in March 2020 , schools opened in a limited fashion , except for students who use English as a second language and those with complex learning needs who were able to attend in - person 5 days / week until June 30 , 2020 . On September 8 , 2020 schools reopened for the 2020 / 21 school year , except for a winter break from December 18 , 2020 to January 4 , 2021 , and spring break from March 12 to 29 , 2021 . COVID - 19 mitigations measures implemented in District schools as well as indications for viral testing are detailed in Appendix 1 . Data Collection : Data was collected from school staff using a questionnaire that asked , among others , about risk factors for COVID - 19 , household structure , physical distancing behavior , close contacts with COVID - 19 cases ( defined by asking : “someone diagnosed with COVID - 19 with whom you’d been within two meters of for greater than two minutes” ) , history of viral testing ( including dates and symptoms ) and vaccination , etc . 23 A second questionnaire about mental health and vaccine perception was also administered but not reported in this paper . COVID - 19 vaccination in blood donors was collected by asking at the time of blood donation . To estimate the degree of exposure to known COVID - 19 cases , we obtained data from VCH’s Case and Contact Management Interface . The District provided student and staff lists to VCH , which linked the data to determine the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among students and staff in District schools . Adult education staff were excluded . Staff and students affiliated with Vancouver Alternate Secondary School programs were counted as attending a single school for the purposes of incidence calculations . Given that the history of viral testing in the prospective school staff sample was obtained via questionnaires , we selected the median date of questionnaire completion ( March 4 , 2021 ) as the end date for data extraction . We extracted all lab - confirmed , probable , and epidemiologically - linked COVID - 19 cases reported to VCH . To assess the incidence of known infection among staff over the course of the pandemic , we calculated the incidence of reported staff cases from January 15 , 2020 ( corresponding to the first case reported to VCH ) to March 4 , 2021 . Similarly , exposure to student cases during the school year was estimated by calculating the incidence from September 8 , 2020 to March 4 , 2021 . Serology testing : Blood samples were collected from February 10 to May 15 2021 , at clinics set - up in various participating Vancouver schools , at the BC Children’s Hospital or outpatient clinical laboratories in metro Vancouver . The presence of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 was used as a marker of prior COVID - 19 infection , using dual S - and N - based serology testing , where S - based serology was used in unvaccinated participants and N - based serology testing was used with vaccinated participants ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . Antibodies directed against the spike ( S1 ) protein were detected using the Ortho T VITROS TM Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Total antibody assay ( Ortho IgG ; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics , Rochester , NY ) , a Health Canada and FDA - licensed qualitative assay which detects all types of antibodies ( IgA , IgG and IgM ) . S - based serology testing was done on a Vitros 5600 analyser at the BC Children’s & Women’s Hospital Laboratory , which is accredited for clinical testing . Literature and in - house validation demonstrated this assay can identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals > 7 days post illness onset with a sensitivity between 90 . 7 % and 97 . 7 % , and specificities between 99 . 4 % and 100 % 24 , 25 . Specimens were considered reactive at a cut - off index ≥ 1 . 00 . All S - tested negative samples with S - antibody indexes > 99 th centile were also confirmed to be negative on the Roche assay . Testing for anti - nucleocapsid ( N ) protein SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was performed using the Roche Elecsys TM Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ( Roche T ; Roche , USA ) .

Testing was performed on a Cobas e601 analyzer at St . Paul’s Hospital Laboratory . Blood donors were tested for both SARS - CoV - 2 spike and N antibodies using the Roche Elecsys TM Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 S and Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ( Roche , USA ) assays , respectively , on a Cobas e801 analyzer , and assigned using a similar S / N strategy for vaccinated / unvaccinated cases ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . Statistical analyses : Blood donors were identified to match study participants by age and sex ± 2 years and two donors randomly selected without replacement for each study participant . As not all participants could be matched , criteria were relaxed to include additional donors ( Supplemental Data ) . The Rogan - Gladen estimator was used to calculate the true prevalence adjusting for test specificity and sensitivity , with 95 % confidence intervals estimated using Blaker’s method . 29 For seroprevalence in school staff and blood donors , sensitivities of 95 . 3 % and 96 . 6 % , and specificities of 100 % were used for the two S - based assays , respectively . 25 , 30 Results COVID - 19 cases from VCH contact tracing data in District schools ( N = 47280 students and N = 7071 school staff ) : During the 2020 - 2021 school year 46879 students attended District schools in - person , and 401 students attended an Alternate District School ( total of 47280 students ) . As shown in Figure 1 , the overall weekly rates of reported COVID - 19 cases among staff and students during the pandemic followed a trend similar to the weekly rates among Vancouver residents . The population - level incidence of COVID - 19 cases among students ( including Vancouver Alternate Secondary Schools ) during the 2020 / 21 school year was 9 . 8 cases per 1000 students , ranging from 0 to 63 cases per 1000 between schools ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . Among schools with at least 1 student case , the median number of student cases was 3 , and the median school population was 376 students . In addition , 67 out of the 107 schools ( 62 . 6 % ) had no staff members diagnosed as confirmed , probable , or epidemiologically - linked COVID - 19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic . Twenty - six of the 40 schools ( 65 % ) with staff cases had only one staff case . Including staff of Vancouver Alternate Secondary Schools , the incidence of reported cases from January 15 , 2020 to March 4 , 2021 among staff within specific schools ranged from 0 cases per 1000 staff to a maximum of 167 COVID - 19 cases per 1000 staff . Among schools with at least 1 staff case , the median number of staff cases was 1 , and the median size of each school’s staffing complement was 46 . 5 staff members . All schools with incidences higher than 80 COVID - 19 cases per 1000 staff had only 1 or 2 staff cases among a staffing complement of under 25 staff . The incidence of reported COVID - 19 cases from January 15 , 2020 to March 4 , 2021 was 13 cases per 1000 classroom staff , and 14 cases per 1 , 000 non - classroom staff ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . COVID - 19 cases self - reported in school staff sample ( N = 1689 ) : Staff COVID - 19 cases reported to VCH were compared to questionnaire data . In total , there were 2162 access to the screener , of which 1743 staff identified themselves , provided contact information and consented on - line ( Figure 2 ) . The characteristics of 1689 staff who completed the questionnaire , corresponding to 23 . 9 % of eligible staff ( Table 1 ) . Notably , 63 . 7 % of study participants were elementary school staff and 28 . 1 % were secondary school staff ( Table 1 ) , which align with District data ( not shown ) . Overall , a majority ( 78 . 2 % ; n = 1320 ) of school staff were classroom staff , and spent a median of 17 . 6 hours of contact time with students per week ( Table 1 ) . The District estimated that 5091 staff have classroom responsibilities . Therefore , we estimate that the study enrolled at least ~ 26 % of all staff with classroom responsibilities .

Among the school staff who completed the questionnaire , 51 reported a positive viral test among their household members ( Table 2 ) . In total , 363 ( 21 . 5 % ) reported a history of close contact with a COVID - 19 case at or outside school , but only 24 reported ever testing positive by nucleic acid testing ( Table 2 ) . Four ( 16 . 7 % ) tested positive by nucleic acid testing prior to the beginning of classes in September 2020 . In total , 24 of 1689 school staff self - reported a positive viral test which represents an incidence rate of COVID - 19 case of 1 . 4 % . Of the 24 school staff who reported a positive viral test , 5 ( 21 % ) reported close contact with a student or co - worker case , including one who required hospitalization during the 2020 / 21 school year . Seven ( 29 % ) reported close contact with a friend or family member with COVID - 19 , and one reported close contact with both a co - worker and family member with COVID - 19 . Eleven had unknown sources of acquisition and were not aware of any close contact with a COVID - 19 case . SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in school staff ( N = 1556 ) : Of 1689 school staff with prospective questionnaire data , 1556 completed serology testing ( median date : March 11 , 2021 ) . Serology results for vaccinated and SARS - CoV - 2 - infected staff are shown in Supplemental Table 2 and 3 , respectively . In total , 35 tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by serology . Therefore , the unadjusted prevalence was 2 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 6 – 3 . 1 % ) , and the seroprevalence after adjusting for the sensitivity and specificity of the test was 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 6 to 3 . 2 % ) . Of the 35 school staff who seroconverted , 29 worked in a classroom setting and one did not work in a classroom setting , but reported more than 20 hours of contact time with students per week , for a seroprevalence also of 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 5 – 3 . 1 % ) . The proportion of staff who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by serology between secondary and elementary schools ( Table 3 ) corresponded to the proportion of staff in each school level ( Table 1 ) . In comparison , the unadjusted seroprevalence in age , sex and geography - matched blood donors was 2 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 5 – 2 . 7 % ) , and 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 7 – 3 . 0 % ) after adjusting for the sensitivity and specificity of the serology test . Discussion To the best of our knowledge , this study is one of the largest to report seroprevalence estimates in the school setting in the later phases of the pandemic in the context of in - person schooling and widespread viral transmission . This study found that the seroprevalence among staff in Vancouver public schools was low after a period of widespread community transmission . Results were consistent with both self - reported infection as well as COVID - 19 cases reported by VCH . Findings are in keeping with modelling studies 31 , 32 and data from the UK where low seroprevalence was also measured in teachers , but this was earlier in the pandemic 15 . Moreover , despite that the seroprevalence in this study represents an approximately three - fold increase relative to previous estimates of 0 . 55 % to 0 . 6 % obtained from Vancouver residents in spring 2020 33 - 35 , it remained comparable to age / sex and area of residency - matched blood donors . A major advantage of the current study is that it was conducted in BC , one of the few , if not only ( as far as we are aware ) jurisdictions in North America that maintained in - person schooling during the 2020 / 21 school year . Study results are drawn from a large sample of staff , including a majority of those exposed to COVID - 19 in the classroom . The use of S - based serology assays identified COVID - 19 cases up to a year before . The study utilized sensitive serology testing to identify cumulative SARS - CoV - 2 cases that may have not come to clinical attention , but could still contribute to the transmission chain 36 . Conversely , the N - based serology test allowed us to account for vaccinated staff towards the end of recruitment . Among our study participants , 21 . 5 % ( 363 ) of school staff reported a close contact with a COVID - 19 case , and the majority ( 76 . 6 % , 278 / 363 ) identified contact with a COVID - 19 case at school . These data alone could reinforce the perception that schools are a risky environment . However , we could not find All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Despite the high frequency of school staff who reported symptoms ( Table 2 ) , 90 . 1 % ( 598 / 664 ) had no serological evidence of infection using a conservative testing strategy . Under - ascertainment by viral testing could have been related to the use of targeted testing up until April 2020 . However , the relatively high proportion ( 60 % ) of cases diagnosed by nucleic acid testing who tested positive via serology suggests good access to viral testing in this specific testing , during the study period . Mitigation strategies employed in BC schools have been shown elsewhere to minimize risk in educators to a level comparable to the risk in the community 37 , 38 . Although non - medical masks were encouraged , but not required in schools until February 2021 ( grades 8 - 12 ) and end of March 2021 ( grades 4 - 12 ) ( Appendix ) , and are still not required for K - 3 students – a situation that is unique in Canada - we also did not detect any meaningful difference in seroprevalence between elementary and secondary school staff . This study has limitations . First , study volunteers are typically healthier , raising a possibility that seroprevalence estimates were underestimated . To estimate this bias , the incidence of COVID - 19 cases based on self - report ( 1 . 4 % ) was compared to the contact tracing data in classroom staff across the entire District ( 1 . 3 % ) and suggests that we did not under sampled those who are in direct contact with students . Second , the seroprevalence of school staff was compared to matched blood donors which may underestimate the community prevalence as the blood donors serology were taken in January 2021 , prior to sampling of the school cohort , which could only reinforce our conclusions . As others have found , serologic testing in blood donors in general does reflect overall seroprevalence in the community 39 - 42 and we would expect the seroprevalence in the reference group of blood donors for the same period to be higher , which reinforces our study conclusion . Consistent with this , seroprevalence estimates based on anonymized , residual specimens collected by the BC Centre for Disease Control in January 2021 from working age adults ( attending one of ~ 80 diagnostic service centres in the only outpatient laboratory network in the greater Vancouver area ) ranged from 3 - 4 % ( DM Skowronski , personal communication ) . Second , the study had limited power to detect small differences between seroprevalence in school staff and the community . However , it is unlikely that small differences would drastically change the public health recommendations that can be made from the data . Third , exposure risks may differ between school and community settings , which needs to be taken into account when attempting to generalize our findings . In conclusion , this study shows no detectable increase in SARS - CoV - 2 infections in school staff working in Vancouver public schools following a period of widespread community transmission ( October – May 2021 ) . The combination of population - level COVID - 19 data based on nucleic acid testing in symptomatic cases and sensitive serology testing among school staff provide strong evidence that their risk of COVID - 19 , in the context of mitigation strategies , is not substantially higher than the community .

COVID - 19 safety plans included public health measures ( e . g . , protocols for testing and contact tracing ) , environmental measures ( e . g . , maximization of distance in classrooms , enhanced cleaning and disinfection , improved fresh air intake ) , administrative measures ( e . g . , staggered scheduling , assigning students and staff cohorts ) , personal measures ( e . g . , daily symptom checks , physical distancing , hand hygiene , respiratory etiquette ) , and personal protective equipment . At the beginning of the school year ( late August / September ) , parents were given the option of : 1 ) full time in - person schooling , 2 ) home schooling , 3 ) online learning and 4 ) a temporary online learning with return to full time schooling with re - entry dates offered later in fall and in January 2021 . Daily health assessments were required by all staff and students ( via parents ) prior to arriving at school and again upon arrival . Anyone with even minor symptoms of cold or flu - like illness was to stay home or go home if these symptoms developed mid - day . Classrooms and other spaces were arranged to maximize distance between students and staff . Class sizes were set by grades : 20 students / class for kindergarten ; 22 for grades 1 to 3 ; 30 for grades 4 to 12 . School staff and their students were assigned specific classrooms which were between 75 m 2 – 83 m 2 for elementary students ( K to grade 7 ) and 75 m 2 – 80 m 2 for secondary students ( grades 8 to 12 ) with larger spaces available for elective courses ( e . g . , physical education , food studies , metal , woodworking , automotive ) . In addition , secondary classrooms were divided into two separate groupings ( AM and PM ) of 15 students . The plan also included revising school schedules and learning groups where students also had staggered recess and lunch breaks , and were assigned specific outside areas . Elementary students ( K - 7 ) received full day in - class instruction in their assigned learning groups / cohorts . Secondary students ( grades 8 to 12 ) had both in - class instruction and remote learning and their schedules shifted to a quarter system with maximum two in - person classes a day with further instruction given remotely . Ventilation measures included opening windows to promote fresh air flow to classrooms as well as indoor air ventilation improved with the HVAC systems running longer during the day , recirculating less air and the filters changed to higher efficiency ( MERV13 ) filters . Other measures included , the addition of hand sanitizer to classrooms and common areas , directional traffic flow within the school , provision of plexiglass as needed for certain staff roles , and the training of all staff on the safety plan and protocols . In addition to the regular daily cleaning by custodial staff , twice daily disinfection of all high touch frequency items was conducted . Shared items in classrooms were limited and the teachers , or if in secondary school , the students disinfected those used . Initially , masking was encouraged , but not required . Non - medical mask use was encouraged but not required early in the school year , and then in February 2021 masks were required for all staff and students in grades 6 - 12 in common spaces , and ultimately from April onward for students grades 4 - 12 at all times while indoors at school . This guidance did not apply if staff or students did not tolerate a mask for health or behavioural All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Masks remained recommended for K - 3 students . Two reusable cloth masks were distributed to all staff and students in September 2020 and again in January 2021 . SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid amplification ( PCR ) was available for anyone with symptoms through the provincial health system , and advised for students or staff with fever or new symptoms which persisted for over 24 hours . Tests were generally processed within 24 hours , and positive tests were automatically reported to Public Health which investigated cases within 24 hours , and initiated contact tracing . Symptomatic close contacts were asked to seek testing ; asymptomatic testing was not used to release contacts from isolation on an earlier timeline . All close contacts , including close contacts at school , were isolated for at least 14 full days . Entire classes were not isolated unless all members were identified as close contacts . School closures to control transmission were not required during the study period . Also , at the time , vaccination programs had not substantially reached working - age people until April 14 , and the majority of school staff vaccinations occurred in May . All rights reserved .
