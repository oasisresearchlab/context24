Using contact tracing data , we 30 identified and characterized SARS - CoV - 2 clusters in Hong Kong . Given a 31 superspreading threshold of 6 - 8 secondary cases , we identified 5 - 7 probable 32 superspreading events and evidence of substantial overdispersion in 33 transmissibility , and estimated that 20 % of cases were responsible for 80 % of local 34 transmission . Among terminal cluster cases , 27 % ( 45 / 167 ) ended in quarantine . 35 Social exposures produced a greater number of secondary cases compared to 36 family or work exposures ( p < 0 . 001 ) while delays between symptom onset and 37 isolation did not reliably predict the number of individual secondary cases or 38 resulting cluster sizes . Public health authorities should focus on rapid tracing and 39 quarantine of contacts , along with physical distancing to prevent superspreading 40 events in high - risk social environments . 41 42 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is a novel beta - 43 coronavirus that was first identified in patients in China in December 2019 and 44 January 2020 , and has since caused over four million confirmed human infections 45 worldwide and more than 300 , 0000 deaths ( 1 ) . Disease caused by SARS - CoV - 2 is 46 termed coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) and was declared a global pandemic 47 on March 11 , 2020 ( 2 ) . Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 48 ( SARS - CoV ) in 2002 - 03 and Middle - East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - 49 4 CoV ) since 2013 have been notable for the occurrence of superspreading events 50 ( SSEs ) ( 3 - 6 ) . SSEs are generally defined as outbreaks in which a small number of 51 cases infect a large number of secondary cases well - above the expected average ( 7 ) . 52 For SARS - CoV , with an basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) of around 3 , ( 8 ) , greater than 53 eight or 10 secondary cases have been suggested to constitute SSEs ( 9 , 10 ) , while for 54 MERS - CoV , SSEs have reportedly involved up to 82 secondary cases ( 11 ) . For SARS - 55 CoV - 2 , the R 0 has been estimated between 2 and 3 ( 12 , 13 ) , and the degree to which 56 SSEs are involved in transmission of COVID - 19 remains unclear . Here , we used 57 contact tracing data to identify and describe clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in 58 Hong Kong and estimate the degree of variance or overdispersion in 59 transmissibility , and therefore the potential for SARS - CoV - 2 SSEs . 60 61 RESULTS 62 Cases and Clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 in Hong Kong 63 As of 28 April 2020 , there have been a total of 1 , 037 laboratory - confirmed cases of 64 SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Hong Kong , and one probable case based on clinical and 65 epidemiological features . The first case of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Hong Kong was 66 confirmed on January 23 , 2020 , imported from Hubei , China ( Onset January 18 , 2020 . 67 The first local cases without known travel history were confirmed on February 4 , 68 2020 among a family cluster with symptom onsets ranging from January 22 , 2020 to 69 February 4 , 2020 indicating potentially undocumented community transmission had 70 occurred in mid - January 2020 prior to the first travel restrictions implemented from 71 5 January 25 , 2020 ( Figure 1 ) . Stable numbers of sporadic and cluster cases were 72 detected until early March when a substantial increase in the number of imported 73 cases was observed ( Figure 1 ) . Cases continued to rise until a total ban on non - 74 resident entry and mandatory 14 - day quarantine for all arrivals was implemented . A 75 rise in the number of local cases including clusters initiated by local or imported 76 cases saw the implementation of various physical distancing measures such as 77 restrictions on gatherings and bar closures to prevent community transmission 78 ( Figure 1 ) . 79 80 Overall the majority ( 51 . 9 % ; 539 / 1 , 038 ) of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in Hong Kong have 81 been associated with at least one of 135 known clusters . The median cluster size was 82 two and the largest involved 106 local cases . The remaining 38 . 9 % ( 210 / 539 ) of 83 cluster cases solely involved imported cases where no onward local transmission 84 could be identified . Most clusters comprised only imported cases ( 82 / 135 ; 60 . 7 % ) , 85 followed by clusters initiated by an imported case ( 30 / 135 ; 22 . 2 % ) and clusters 86 initiated by a local case ( 23 / 135 ; 17 . 0 % ) . Among the 499 sporadic cases not linked to 87 any cluster , 90 . 0 % of infections were acquired overseas ( 449 / 499 ) , while the 88 remaining 50 ( 10 . 0 % ) had no history of travel and could not be linked to any other 89 case either as a source or subsequent generation . Of cluster cases , 225 ( 41 . 7 % ; 90 225 / 539 ) belonged to clusters initiated by another local case , compared to 19 . 3 % 91 ( 104 / 539 ) of cluster cases which belonged to clusters initiated by an imported case . 92 The composition of clusters is described further in Supplementary Table 1 . 93 6 94 Transmission Pairs & Individual variation in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 95 From the 539 infections that occurred in clusters , all 210 solely imported cases 96 ( 210 / 539 ; 38 . 9 % ) were excluded from subsequent analysis due to uncertainties 97 concerning transmission within each cluster whilst overseas . Within the remaining 98 53 clusters initiated by a local or imported infection , 245 ( 245 / 329 ; 74 . 5 % ) could be 99 linked resulting in 171 unique infector - infectee transmission pairs with 94 unique 100 infectors . The age of distribution of infectors and infectees was not significantly 101 different ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) however a positive trend by age can be seen in 102 the transmission pair matrix ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . 103 104 Figure 2A shows the empirical serial distribution between all infector - infectee pairs 105 and fitted normal and lognormal distributions . The median serial interval was 4 106 days ( IQR 3 – 8 days ) , and the mean of the fitted normal distribution was 5 . 6 days 107 ( standard deviation 4 . 3 days ) . We observed at least eight instances of likely pre - 108 symptomatic transmission where symptom onset of the infectee preceded that of the 109 infector by one day ( N = 2 ) or occurred on the same day ( N = 6 ) . Thirty - four unique 110 infectors ( 35 / 94 ; 37 . 2 % ) were linked to two or more secondary cases , and the largest 111 number of individual secondary cases was 11 . From the empirical offspring 112 distribution and fitted negative binomial distribution shown in Figure 2B , we 113 estimated an observed reproductive number ( R ) of 0 . 58 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 45 – 0 . 71 ) and 114 dispersion parameter ( k ) of 0 . 45 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 31 – 0 . 76 ) . Given a superspreading 115 7 threshold of 6 - 8 secondary cases , we directly observed 2 - 4 SSEs where the source 116 was known . Likelihood analysis based on final cluster sizes increased the estimate of 117 R to 0 . 75 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 6 – 0 . 96 ) and decreased estimates of k to 0 . 37 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 16 – 118 1 . 16 ) . Based on these estimates we determined a coefficient of variation of 2 . 5 and 119 inferred that approximately 20 % of SARS - CoV - 2 infections are responsible for 80 % 120 of all transmission events in Hong Kong ( Table 1 ) . Epoch analyses by wave ( before 121 or after March 1 , 2020 ) showed similar estimates of R and k ( Supplementary Table 2 ) 122 from their respective offspring distributions ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . A peak 123 however in the number of index cases per day could be seen in wave two 124 ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Parameter estimates and distributions for all fitted 125 distributions are shown in Supplementary Tables 3 & 4 , and Supplementary Figures 126 4 & 5 . 127 128 Chains of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in Hong Kong 129 The largest local cluster was 106 cases and was traced back to multiple social 130 exposures among a collection of bars across Hong Kong ( Figure 3A ) . Evidence 131 suggested this “bar and band” cluster originated in Lan Kwai Fong among a few 132 staff and customers before being spread to additional venues by a number of 133 musicians , however the source and chains of transmission between many bar cases 134 could not be determined from epidemiological data . The earliest reported exposure 135 was reported on March 7 th among two customers who later presented with 136 symptoms on March 11 th ( Supplementary Figure 6A ) . The earliest symptom onset 137 8 was among two staff members on March 10 th & 11 th , however neither case was 138 confirmed until March 24 th and 25 th and neither reported their history of exposure at 139 the bar during this time . Given the serial intervals between these four cases and later 140 cases ( Supplementary Figure 6A ) , it is possible that an undetected source may have 141 initially infected these staff and customers on March 7 , before being spread to the 142 musicians . The earliest onset among the musicians was on March 17 , with most 143 subsequently affected customers reporting exposures between March 17 and March 144 20 ( Supplementary Figure 6C ) , which is suggestive of at least one or more probably 145 SSEs within this exposure period . The bars were voluntarily closed from March 23 146 for cleaning prior to mandated closures from April 3 . Of the 73 primary bar cases , 39 147 customers , 20 staff , and 14 musicians were infected , while the remaining 33 148 infections were secondary , tertiary or quaternary contacts ( Supplementary Figure 149 6A ) . This single outbreak accounts for 10 . 2 % ( 106 / 1 , 038 ) of all cases in Hong Kong 150 regardless of the source , but 30 . 4 % of all local cases acquired in Hong Kong 151 ( 106 / 349 ) . Evidence of asymptomatic transmission was determined in a single case ( a 152 staff member at the bar ) who was placed in quarantine before their wife 153 subsequently presented with symptoms and tested positive . Supplementary Figure 154 6B shows the age distribution of all cases associated with this cluster . 155 156 Figure 3B describes a cluster of 21 cases linked to a wedding . Ten cases resulted from 157 a previous social exposure ( SSE ) , of which four cases subsequently attended the 158 wedding . Individual transmission pairs within the wedding could not be 159 9 determined , however there were at least seven secondary infections , and therefore 160 another potential SSE , and an additional two tertiary cases among family members 161 of the wedding guests . A final potential SSE of undetermined origin was associated 162 with religious activities at a local temple and resulted in 11 primary cases and 18 163 recorded cases total ( Figure 3C ) . Cases reported multiple exposures over a number 164 of days such that a single point source exposure was unlikely . Six secondary cases 165 were linked via family exposures . The last case who worked at the temple was also 166 infected however remained asymptomatic . It is unknown if this case was the source 167 of the temple exposures or was infected by the undetermined source / s . 168 169 Figure 3D shows all other local cluster cases and chains of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 170 in Hong Kong . In total , 51 subsequent cases were quarantined . Among terminal 171 transmission cases , 26 . 9 % ( 45 / 167 ) ended in quarantine ( excluding five quarantined 172 bars cases whose terminal transmission position was ambiguous ; Figure 4A ; 173 Supplementary Table 5 ) . The odds that a terminal case ended in quarantine was 174 16 . 97 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 27 – 126 . 69 ) , while the probability that a case was terminal and 175 quarantined was 21 . 0 % ( 45 / 214 ) compared to 57 . 0 % ( 122 / 214 ) for cases who were 176 terminal but not quarantined ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Transmission within families 177 was the most frequent event among all recognised transmission pairs ( 96 / 171 ; 56 . 1 % ) 178 followed by transmission in social settings ( 55 / 171 ; 32 . 2 % ) and at work ( 20 / 171 ; 179 11 . 1 % ) . However , there was very strong evidence that the number of individual 180 secondary cases resulting from social exposures was significantly higher compared 181 10 to work or family exposures ( μ = 2 . 89 vs . 1 . 36 ; p < 0 . 001 , negative binomial regression 182 model ) . 183 184 Relationship between delayed case isolation and potential COVID - 19 cluster size 185 Figure 4A shows the median individual delay from symptom onset - to - 186 confirmation / isolation among SARS - CoV - 2 infections in Hong Kong by cluster 187 membership on the basis of size . We found that the delay from symptom onset to 188 confirmation among cluster cases did not predict the overall cluster size although if 189 excluding the two largest clusters there was a slight increase in onset - to - isolation 190 delays in some of the larger clusters ( Figure 4A ) . Delay from symptom - onset to 191 isolation among infectors similarly was not associated with the number of secondary 192 cases or the overall size of each cluster ( p = 0 . 955 , linear regression ; Figure 4B ) . 193 194 DISCUSSION 195 Public health measures have successfully suppressed transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 196 infections in Hong Kong with an estimated reproductive number below 1 ( Table 1 ; 197 R = 0 . 58 , 95 % : 0 . 45 – 0 . 71 ) compared to estimates of the basic reproductive number R 0 198 of 2 - 3 ( 12 , 13 ) , and our estimate varied only marginally between phase one ( Jan - Feb ) 199 and phase two of the epidemic in Hong Kong ( Mar - Apr ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ; 200 R = 0 . 60 , 95 % : 0 . 35 – 0 . 94 and R = 0 . 56 , 95 % : 0 . 43 – 0 . 70 ) . Thirty - three percent ( 349 / 1 , 038 ) 201 of all SARS - CoV - 2 infections in have been acquired within Hong Kong , either within 202 clusters or as sporadic local cases occurring through limited community 203 11 transmission that has been controlled through a range of public health measures 204 ( 14 ) . Our results indicate 5 - 7 probable SSEs in Hong Kong , and substantial 205 individual heterogeneity in the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Table 1 ; 206 k = 0 . 45 , 95 % : 0 . 30 – 0 . 72 ) and therefore potential for future superspreading , albeit less 207 than SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV ( k = 0 . 16 and 0 . 26 respectively ) ( 15 , 16 ) . Super - 208 spreading events pose considerable challenges for local control as they can quickly 209 overwhelm public health contact tracing capacity , and because most infected 210 persons will generate few secondary infections , while a small fraction can generate 211 many ( Figure 2B ) . Indeed , we estimated that approximately 20 % of cases were 212 responsible for 80 % of all SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in Hong Kong ( Table 1 ) . These 213 results however should be interpreted in the context of constrained community 214 transmission given moderate levels of physical distancing currently practiced in 215 Hong Kong , including school closures , some adults working at home , cancellation of 216 mass gatherings , as well as improved hygiene and universal mask wearing ( 17 ) . 217 Recent findings from Shenzhen , China estimated comparable levels of 218 overdispersion using contact tracing data ( k = 0 . 58 ) ( 18 ) , however other studies 219 utilizing global datasets have estimated even greater potential for SARS - CoV - 2 220 superspreading ( k = 0 . 1 given a global R of 2 . 5 ) and suggest as little as 10 % of cases 221 could account for 80 % of all transmission ( 19 ) . Such degrees of overdispersion 222 however can be advantageous to disease control efforts if interventions can 223 effectively target the core high - risk group responsible for the majority of 224 transmission ( 20 , 21 ) . 225 12 226 Superspreading is considered a function of both variations in individual 227 transmissibility and individual susceptibility or exposure . Our results show that the 228 number of individual secondary cases was significantly higher within social settings 229 such as bars and restaurants compared to family or work exposures ( p < 0 . 001 ) . This is 230 certainly due to the greater numbers of contacts expected in such settings . Social 231 exposures are therefore at an increased risk for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and likely 232 constitute the core behavioural risk factor for SSEs . Targeted interventions should 233 therefore focus on reducing extreme numbers of social contacts at high - risk venues 234 such as bars , nightclubs and restaurants , which also appear at increased risk of SSE 235 ( 22 ) , either via closures or physical distancing policies , both of which currently 236 remain implemented in Hong Kong ( 17 ) . Models have shown however that 237 heterogeneity in exposure may also have disproportionate effects on herd immunity 238 ( 23 ) , including SARS - CoV - 2 ( 24 , 25 ) . Because some individuals are at greater risk of 239 exposure , achieving herd immunity in this core risk group may therefore have 240 suppressive effects on local transmission more generally , potentially reducing the 241 otherwise necessary duration and intensity of more disruptive community - wide 242 physical distancing policies . Given a coefficient of variation of 2 . 5 from our study 243 ( Table 1 ) this roughly corresponds to an adjusted herd immunity threshold of 20 % 244 ( 25 ) , which is consistent with our estimate that 20 % of individuals are responsible for 245 80 % of transmission in Hong Kong . This compares to a herd - immunity threshold of 246 60 - 70 % via vaccine - acquired immunity . The real - world effects of naturally acquired 247 13 herd immunity however should be further studies and measured with serology 248 along with the progressive easing of restrictions . 249 250 Previous modelling has suggested that reduced delays between symptom onset and 251 isolation are important indicators for the control of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks ( 20 ) , 252 however this did not appear to play a major role in Hong Kong : in our analysis , 253 delay from symptom onset to isolation were not associated with the number of 254 individual secondary cases , nor the final cluster size ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . In contrast , 255 for SARS - CoV various epidemics in 2003 , due to delayed viral shedding among 256 cases ( highest approximately seven days after symptom onset ) ( 26 , 27 ) , delays in 257 case isolation adversely affected disease control efforts ( 28 ) . For COVID - 19 , 258 confirmation and isolation of symptomatic cases will have a limited effect on 259 reducing overall SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the community unless done very 260 quickly , noting the growing body of evidence of substantial transmission during the 261 pre - symptomatic and early symptomatic period ( 29 - 31 ) . In Hong Kong , the average 262 delay to isolation was 5 . 6 days for cluster cases ( Figure 4 ) , and by this time most 263 onwards transmission had perhaps already occurred . The most important public 264 health measures therefore are likely to be case identification followed by rapid and 265 parallel ( e . g . before contacts are confirmed as cases ) contact tracing and quarantine . 266 Some degree of intermittent physical distancing may also be required to supress 267 potential local transmission from unidentified infections and pre - symptomatic 268 14 transmission , but must necessarily be balanced with the social , economic and 269 educational costs associated with such policies . 270 271 Overall our study has a few limitations . Primarily , because this study relies on the 272 completeness of case ascertainment and contact tracing data , any degree of 273 incompleteness could therefore bias our estimates . Further , because the source of 50 274 sporadic local infections could not be determined , we likely underestimated R based 275 on the empirical data alone . In fact , the expected difference between of R and k from 276 our observed estimates and likelihood model indicates the presence of some 277 incompleteness and therefore potential bias , however only marginally so ( Table 1 ) . 278 Secondly , our results also suggest a potential caveat : despite evidence supporting 279 rapid contact tracing and the effectiveness of quarantine ( Figure 4 ) , in our analysis , 280 most chains of transmission did not terminate in quarantine ( Figure 3 ; 281 Supplementary Table 5 ) . This however must be interpreted in the context of 282 moderate physical distancing in Hong Kong as highlighted previously ( 17 ) , rather 283 than a suggestion that quarantine was not essential . 284 285 Overall there is substantial potential for SSEs in COVID - 19 , but less so than for SARS 286 and MERS . In the absence of non - pharmaceutical interventions such as physical 287 distancing implemented in Hong Kong , the potential for SSEs is likely greater than 288 observed in our study . Assuming local elimination is not possible , disease control 289 efforts should focus on rapid tracing and quarantine of confirmed contacts , along 290 15 with the implementation of physical distancing policies or closures targeting high - 291 risk social exposures such as bars , nightclubs and restaurants to prevent the 292 occurrence of SSEs . Given the long right - hand tail of the distribution of individual 293 reproductive numbers ( Figure 2B ) , preventing SSEs would have a considerable effect 294 in reducing the overall reproductive number . In lieu of an effective vaccine , these 295 results have significant implications for the control of COVID - 19 and public health 296 measures such as physical distancing and the relaxation of lockdowns around the 297 world . 298 299 METHODS 300 Characterisation of clusters and chains of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 301 Using case line lists and contact tracing data obtained from the Centre for Health 302 Protection ( CHP ) of the Department of Health in Hong Kong we characterised 303 clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 infections and chains of transmission within clusters . Cases 304 of SARS - CoV - 2 infection were laboratory confirmed via RT - PCR . Clusters were 305 defined as two or more confirmed infections with close contact prior to or following 306 symptom onset . Each cluster was characterised by the travel history of the index case 307 as either initiated by an imported case ( i . e . index acquired SARS - CoV - 2 infection 308 overseas ) , initiated by a local case or clusters of solely imported cases . Cases not 309 linked to any cluster were categorised as sporadic local or sporadic imported cases if 310 infection was acquired locally or overseas . We determined probable infector - infectee 311 transmission pairs and chains of transmission within clusters from reported contact 312 16 histories and symptom onset dates for all clusters initiated by an imported or local 313 case . Transmission pairs were characterised by the reported site of contact as either 314 family , social , work or during local travel such as on public transport and modelled 315 using a negative binomial log - linear model . Transmission between cases within 316 clusters of solely imported cases were not considered due to substantial ambiguities 317 concerning transmission within each cluster whilst overseas . 318 319 Calculation of serial interval and empirical offspring distribution 320 We calculated the median serial interval as the difference between the symptom 321 onset dates of each infector - infectee pair , excluding asymptomatic cases , and fitted 322 normal , lognormal , gamma and Weibull distributions using the R package 323 “ fitdistrplus " and maximum - likelihood methods , excluding eight non - positive data 324 points for the latter three distributions . We generated the empirical offspring 325 distribution from the observed number of secondary cases per individual infector 326 and similarly fit negative binomial , geometric and Poisson distributions as before . 327 Cases terminal to the inferred chain of transmission and sporadic local cases were 328 considered to have zero secondary cases . We investigated the relationship between 329 delay in days from symptom onset - to - confirmation as a proxy for potential 330 infectiousness in the community and the number of secondary cases per infector by 331 linear regression . We compared each fit distribution using Akaike information 332 criterion ( AIC ) scores and calculated confidence intervals for parameter from 1000 333 bootstrapped replicates . 334 17 Superspreading and individual variance of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 335 Individual variation in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 336 Following the approach described by Lloyd Smith et al . ( 15 ) , estimates of the 337 observed reproductive number ( R ) was determined from the mean of the negative 338 binomial distribution fit to the empirical offspring distribution , and the degree of 339 individual variation on transmission from the corresponding dispersion parameter k . 340 We repeated this analysis for both wave one ( January - February 2020 ) and wave two 341 ( March - April 2020 ) , sub - setting by illness onset date of the index case . Due to 342 potential biases affecting the empirical offspring distributions , we simultaneously 343 implemented a likelihood - based branching process model to jointly infer R and k 344 given the final size of all local clusters following Kucharski and Althaus ( 16 ) where 345 the probability that an index case generates clusters n of size j is given by ( 32 , 33 ) : 346 347 𝑟 𝑗 = Γ ( 𝑘𝑗 + ( 𝑗 − 1 ) Γ ( 𝑘𝑗 ) Γ ( 𝑗 + 1 ) ( 𝑅 0 𝑘 ) 𝑗−1 ( 1 + 𝑅 0 𝑘 ) 𝑘𝑗 + 𝑗−1 348 And the likelihood is : 349 𝐿 = ∏ 𝑟 𝑗𝑛 𝑗 ∞ 𝑗 = 1 350 351 For a given range of values for R ( 0 . 10 – 3 . 00 ) and k ( 0 . 01 – 55 ) , the probability of an 352 index case generating a cluster equal to or greater than j is given by : 353 354 18 𝑝 𝑗 = 1 − ∑ 𝑟 𝑖 𝑗−1 𝑖−1 355 356 From the empirical and likelihood model estimates of R and k , we calculated the 357 coefficient of variation as the ratio of standard deviation of the corresponding 358 negative binomial distribution and the mean . Following from Endo et al . ( 19 ) , given 359 parameters R and k , the expected proportion of cases responsible for 80 % of 360 transmission in Hong Kong is given by : 361 362 1 − P80 % = 1 𝑅 0 ∫ ⌊𝑥⌋NB ( ⌊𝑥⌋ ; 𝑘 , 𝑘 𝑅 0 + 𝑘 ) 𝑋 0 𝑑𝑥 363 where X satisfies : 364 1 − 0 . 8 = 1 𝑅 0 ∫ ⌊𝑥⌋NB ( ⌊𝑥⌋ ; 𝑘 , 𝑘 𝑅 0 + 𝑘 ) 𝑋 0 𝑑𝑥 365 and : 366 1 𝑅 0 ∫ ⌊𝑥⌋NB ( ⌊𝑥⌋ ; 𝑘 , 𝑘 𝑅 0 + 𝑘 ) 𝑋 0 𝑑𝑥 = ∫ ⌊𝑥⌋NB ( ⌊𝑥⌋ ; 𝑘 + 1 , 𝑘 𝑅 0 + 𝑘 ) 𝑋−1 0 𝑑𝑥 367 368 Finally , as per Lloyd Smith et al . ( 15 ) given R 0 , the superspreading threshold is 369 calculated as the 99 th - percentile of the Poisson ( R 0 ) distribution where : 370 Pr ( 𝑍 ≤ 𝑍 ( 99 ) | 𝑍 ~ Poisson ( 𝑅 0 ) ) = 0 . 01 . Therefore , with the global consensus of R 0 in 371 the range 2 – 3 , we define the superspreading threshold for SARS - CoV - 2 here as 6 - 8 372 19 individual secondary cases .

The lognormal distribution was fitted excluding 505 observations ≤0 days . ( B ) Empirical offspring distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 among 506 local and imported COVID - 19 cases in Hong Kong ( excluding clusters of cases 507 where infections had been acquired overseas ) and a fitted negative binomial 508 distribution with R = 0 . 58 and k = 0 . 45 . 509 510 Figure 3 . Local chains of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in Hong Kong initiated by 511 another local case or an imported case . ( A ) Tran smission network of the “bar and 512 band” cluster of cases . The source case of the initial exposure could not be 513 determined . ( B ) Transmission network associated with a single wedding exposure 514 subsequently linked to a preceding social gathering and local source exposure . ( C ) 515 Transmission network associated with a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong . Primary 516 cases report multiple distinct exposures to the temple over the course of many days . 517 It is suspected that an asymptomatic monk at the temple may have been the source 518 26 ( indicated by the pink circle ) however it cannot be known if they were exposed to 519 another case , possibly an environmental exposure . ( D ) All other clusters of SARS - 520 CoV - 2 infections initiated by local and imported cases where the source and 521 transmission chain could be determined . Footnote 1 : An asymptomatic employee at one 522 of the bars was placed in quarantine on 26 March following recognition of the cluster and 523 tested positive on 4 April . Was transferred to hospital for observation but did not develop 524 symptoms . This employee’s wife developed symptoms on 1 April and was confirmed to have 525 SARS - CoV - 2 infection on 6 April . 526 527 Figure 4 .
