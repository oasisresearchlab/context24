Turkey , one of the countries severely affected by the disease , has 81 provinces showing regionally different incidence rate patterns . This study explores the effect of social , economic , demographic , climatic , and geographic characteristics of different regions on the COVID - 19 spread in Turkey . Geographic Information System ( GIS ) - based spatial interpolation techniques and multiple linear regression analysis have been conducted to examine the relationship between provincial incidence rates and eighteen explanatory variables determined by an in - depth literature survey . Results show that five of eighteen predictors have a statistically significant impact and can explain 57 % of the regional variability of the COVID - 19 incidence rates . Urbanization level , education index , and wind speed positively associate with the virus spread , but the sunshine duration and average temperature negatively correlate . On the other hand , 43 % of the variation is due to other factors not included in this study . Therefore , an interdisciplinary study should be carried out by participating in all the related fields such as natural sciences , engineering and technology , medical and health sciences , social sciences , and humanities to understand the dynamics of the disease . Keywords COVID - 19 · GIS · Regression analysis · Turkey Introduction After the first case in China in December 2019 , COVID - 19 pandemic now threatens all humanity . Currently , there are 393 , 502 , 787 confirmed cases and 5 , 735 , 289 deaths on the global scale ( JHU 2022 ) . Until now , many scientific studies have been carried out , and a vast amount of scientific articles has been published worldwide to understand the effects of social , demographic , economic , physical , biological , geo - graphic , and environmental factors on COVID - 19 incidence rates . The literature survey proffers that few researchers have addressed the issue of principal reasons of the virus spread in Turkey . In addition , previous works have been limited to specific parts of the problem . This study investigates the relationship between possible causes and COVID - 19 inci - dence rates in Turkey with a comprehensive and holistic approach by Geographic Information System ( GIS ) - based spatial modeling techniques and advanced statistics . Hays ( 2009 ) claims that physically inadequate living spaces and environments played an essential role in spread - ing epidemic and pandemic diseases throughout history and the spread of diseases to enormous masses occurred because of people living together more intensely in line with the development of urbanization . Alirol et al . ( 2011 ) state high - density cities as the breeding ground for pandemics . People live together in cities , come together in public spaces , use public transportation , and consciously or unconsciously violate the social distance necessary to protect themselves . An increasing number of studies have found that population density has a strong positive correlation with the COVID - 19 spread ( Sarkar et al . 2021 ; Arif and Sengupta 2021 ; Coşkun et al . 2021 ; Mehmood et al . 2021 ; Mishra et al . 2020 ; Man - sour et al . 2021 ; Hamidi et al . 2020 ; Almagro and Orane - Hutchinson 2020 ; Rocklöv and Sjödin 2020 ; Wheaton and Thompson 2020 ) . More recent evidence reveals that trans - mission of the virus increases with the social and spatial interaction between people , so urbanized areas are favora - ble environments for the spread of outbreaks because of their building and population density . Conversely , Carozzi Responsible Editor : Biswajeet Pradhan * Cem Kırlangıçoğlu kirlangicoglu @ sakarya . edu . tr 1 Faculty of Art , Design and Architecture , Sakarya University , Sakarya , Turkey / Published online : 22 February 2022 Arabian Journal of Geosciences ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 et al . ( 2020 ) have found no association between population density and COVID - 19 incidence rates in urban counties of the USA . On the other hand , Bhadra et al . ( 2021 ) have found a moderate association between population density and COVID - 19 spread in India through deep regression and correlation analyses based on case numbers and mortality rates . Gavi ( 2020 ) argues that urbanization rate and climate change are effective on the virus spread , too . Since COVID - 19 is an airborne disease , meteorological conditions such as daily sunshine duration , temperature , wind , humidity , and air quality may influence the spread of the virus ( Iqbal et al . 2020 ; Qi et al . 2020 ; Xie and Zhu 2020 ; Wu et al . 2020 ) . Gupta et al . ( 2020 ) , Xie and Zhu ( 2020 ) , Tosepu et al . ( 2020 ) , Bashir et al . ( 2020 ) , Chen et al . ( 2020 ) , and Şahin ( 2020 ) affirm that there is a linear correlation with average air temperature and COVID - 19 cases in different countries such as India , Indonesia , Turkey , and the USA . Humidity is accepted as another influential factor in virus spread by some researchers , such as Ahmadi et al . ( 2020 ) , Ali and Alharbi ( 2020 ) , Auler et al . ( 2020 ) , and Wu et al . ( 2020 ) . Thangariyal et al . ( 2020 ) point out a negative and substantial correlation between daily sunshine duration and COVID - 19 cases after examining 138 countries worldwide . In addition , Zhu et al . ( 2020 ) , Frontera et al . ( 2020 ) , and Wang et al . ( 2020 ) consider that the wind has an indirect effect on virus spread by affecting air quality . Alternatively , Coşkun et al . ( 2021 ) report the direct effect of wind speed on virus spread by increasing air circulation in Turkey . Corre - spondingly , air quality may be another comprehensive indi - cator of the spread of many airborne viruses like COVID - 19 ( Zhang et al . 2020a ) . Firstly , where air pollution is high , the virus can stay in the air longer , travel further distances , spread over larger areas , and penetrate deeper into the lungs ( Andree 2020 ; Zhu et al . 2020 ; Doremalen et al . 2020 ) . Secondly , air pollution may negatively affect the normal functions of the lungs and make some people more vulner - able than others to the virus ( Ali and Alharbi 2020 ; Korber 2020 ; Helen 2020 ; Fattorini and Regoli 2020 ) . Saadat et al . ( 2020 ) found that different socioeconomic groups react dif - ferently to the virus spread , especially that household size may positively affect the incident rates . The household - based studies highlight the virus’s secondary attack rate for household contacts , which is much higher than that for non - household close contacts ( Jing et al . 2020 ) . That means if infected people are not isolated , the disease risk increases for their household . In their overview , Zhang et al . ( 2021 ) underline that cities with higher GDP values are more at risk than others because of the virus spread due to higher trade and commercial activities among people . Likewise , Zhang et al . ( 2020b ) investigated a robust positive corre - lation between case numbers and GDP in Chinese cities . Mansour et al . ( 2021 ) explored sociodemographic and health factors such as age structure , population density , hospital beds , and nursing practitioners to explain and predict the spatial transmission of the incidence rates in Oman . They maintain that the incidence rate increases as parallel to an increase in age , especially that people older than 65 years are more at risk than the others . Age may be a crucial fac - tor for the incident rates because younger and older people have different susceptibility levels . Reniers ( 2020 ) outlines several reasons that young people take more risks against social distancing and other precautions . Zhang et al . ( 2021 ) draw our attention to the inverse correlation between the health indicators such as the number of health institutions , health personnel , hospital beds , and the case numbers after examining 342 cities of China . In their review , Sands et al . ( 2016 ) affirm that health infrastructure , health surveillance , and response measures directly affect any virus spread ; thus , each province’s physician number and hospital bed capacity are crucial factors to fight against these types of viruses . In a study conducted in Oman , COVID - 19 incidence rates have been found to be negatively associated with hospital bed numbers ( Mansour et al . 2021 ) . Understanding the principal variables and the main char - acteristics of the virus will help us propose a new way of urbanism for post - pandemic cities ( Megahed and Ghoneim 2020 ) . There may be hundreds of factors affecting the virus spread in different regions under divergent physical and social conditions . In line with the official data available , this study focuses on eighteen possibly explanatory variables , which are population density , urbanization level , median age , household size , GDP per capita , average air tempera - ture , humidity , daily sunshine duration , average wind speed , air quality index , health index , income and wealth index , education index , environment index , social life index , life satisfaction ratio , number of hospital beds , and total physi - cian number in the cities . Area of the study The study area , Turkey , is mathematically positioned between approximately 26° – 45° eastern meridians and 36° – 42° northern parallels given in Fig . 1 ( Doğanay and Orhan 2019 ) . The population of Turkey is reported as 83 , 614 , 362 by the Turkish Statistical Institute ( Turkstat 2020 ) , and the total surface area is 777 , 971 km 2 . According to the Turkish Republic Ministry of Environment and Urban - ization ( MoEU 2011 ) , 97 % of the country is in Asia , and the rest is in Europe . Database of Coordination of Information on the Environment ( CORINE ) , a prototype project work - ing on many different environmental issues , is serviced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Turkey ( MoAF 2019 ) . It shows that 1 . 94 % of the country is an artificial area , 42 . 26 % is an agricultural area , 50 . 31 % is forest and semi - natural area , 0 . 51 % is wetland , and 4 . 98 % is water body . 401 Page 2 of 16 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 In Turkey , the first COVID - 19 case was notified on March 11 , 2020 . As of July 9 , 2021 , the confirmed total case num - ber is 5 , 514 , 373 and the death number is 50 , 450 , as main - tained by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health ( MoH 2021 ) . This paper will focus on 81 provinces of Turkey to determine the influential factors and reasons for regional differences in confirmed incidence rates . Data and method The Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health releases weekly situation reports about COVID - 19 statistics , including pro - vincial incidence rates and case numbers since February 8 , 2021 . This study has been conducted by 5 months of pro - vincial data published until July 9 , 2021 . Table 1 enumer - ates the COVID - 19 numbers for each province based on the official data published between February 8 , 2021 , and July 9 , 2021 . Statistical studies are usually carried out on numbers , but numbers visualized on maps are much more effective for understanding the spatial distribution of statistics . So , inverse distance weighted ( IDW ) interpolation tool of Arc - GIS , a commercially available software package , has been used to produce spatial distribution maps related to all the variables . The dataset is based on point data of 81 city cent - ers , including spatial and non - spatial data about the prov - inces , acquired from Turkey’s Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning . Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of con - firmed case numbers in Turkey . İstanbul has 924 , 793 cases , the highest COVID - 19 case number among Turkish cities . Ankara , İzmir , and Konya provinces follow it . A distribution map of case numbers is not enough to understand the reasons and regional differ - ences of the virus spread . While the population of İstanbul is 15 , 519 . 267 , the population of Tunceli Province is just 84 , 660 ( Turkstat 2020 ) . Naturally , the case counts are much higher in Istanbul , which has a 183 times greater population size . For this reason , the case distribution has been normal - ized for all provinces . Figure 3 depicts the spatial distribu - tion of confirmed COVID - 19 incidence rates ( case number per 100 , 000 people ) in Turkey . Figure 3 demonstrates that the Marmara , Mid - Black Sea , and Eastern Black Sea regions have the highest inci - dence rates while Southeast Anatolia and the south part of Eastern Anatolia regions have the lowest rates . As the figures reveal the regional differences , this study will use correlation and regression analyses to determine the reasons and the association between possible factors and COVID - 19 incidence rates . While correlation is a model that defines the relationship between two or more variables through their covariance ( Demir 2019 ) , a regression model gives the relationship’s mathematical function among vari - ables . That function may estimate the value of a variable based on other variables . Regression analysis explains a variation on the dependent variable ( Y ) with independent variables ( X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , … , X n ) . The dependent variable is Fig . 1 Location of the study area ( Turkey ) Page 3 of 16 401 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 explained or predicted in the regression model ( Ersöz and Ersöz 2019 ) . This variable is assumed to be associated with the independent variables , also called explanatory variables in the regression model ( Karataş 2014 ) . The linear equation between Y i and X i variables is obtained as follows : where Y is the expected value of the dependent variable , X is the independent variable , β is the regression coefficient , Ɛ is the residual , and n is the number of independent variables . Table 2 lists the variables used in this study in line with the literature survey and available official data . The data about all the variables have been ensured from the local and central government agencies .

It can be calculated by proportioning the population size with the province’s total surface area . Popu - lation numbers and case counts have an obvious positive relationship , but the relationship of incidence and popula - tion density differs . Figure 4 portrays the population density distribution in different regions of Turkey . The population density of Turkey is 107 . 45 people per km 2 all over the country . Marmara region is the most densely populated region , including İstanbul ( 2842 p / km 2 ) and Kocaeli ( 575 p / km 2 ) cities . On the other hand , Erzincan ( 20 p / km 2 ) , Ardahan ( 19 . 7 p / km 2 ) , and Tunceli ( 11 p / km 2 ) have the lowest population density in the country . In Turkey , while people living in urban areas are 93 % of the citizens , 7 % of residents live in rural areas ( MoH 2018 ) . The median age is 32 . 4 ( Turkstat 2020 ) , the average household size is 3 . 35 ( Turkstat 2019 ) , and according to Turkstat ( 2018b ) , the average GDP per capita is 9693 USD . Figure 5 illustrates the Fig . 2 Distribution of confirmed COVID - 19 case numbers in Turkey Fig . 3 Distribution of COVID - 19 incidence rates in Turkey Page 5 of 16 401 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 distribution maps of urban population ratio , household size , median age , and GDP per capita values . The spatial distribution maps of the meteorological fac - tors in Turkey based on official annual data are given in Fig . 6 . While heat is a sum of the kinetic energy of particles that make up a substance , temperature refers to the reflection of this energy to the outside . Temperature is measured by a thermometer and expressed in °C ( Doğrusöz 2018 ) . The annual average temperature of Turkey is 13 . 2 °C . Air quality index ( AQI ) classifies air pollution to characterize the air quality in particular regions , and it is based on five basic contaminative which are particulate matters ( PM10 ) , sul - fur dioxide ( SO 2 ) , nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2 ) , ozone ( O 3 ) , and carbon monoxide ( CO ) emissions ( WAQI 2020 ) . AQI data for Turkey has been gathered from IQAir ( 2020 ) and MoEU ( 2021 ) . The average AQI for Turkey is 45 . 60 , which means air pollution poses a minor threat except for some regions with polluted and unhealthy air conditions .

( per 1000 people ) Fig . 4 Population density distribution in Turkey 401 Page 6 of 16 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 water vapor in the atmosphere is called humidity . A hygrom - eter is used to measure the humidity of the air . Turkish State Meteorological Service ( TSMS 2020a ) reported the average relative humidity in Turkey as 63 . 7 % . The length of time that shows how much of the day is sunny is called daily sunshine duration , and it is measured by heliograph . In Turkey , the average daily sunshine duration is 6 . 6 h by the measurements between 2011 and 2018 ( TSMS 2020b ) . The wind is another meteorological factor that may allow the virus to spread in the air and travel longer dis - tances . The average wind speed of Turkey is 2 m / s at 10 m above ground ( TSMS 2020b ) . Figure 7 shows the spatial distribution of wind speed in different regions of Turkey . Çanakkale has the highest wind speed , which is 6 . 6 m / s , followed by İzmir ( 5 m / s ) , Mardin ( 4 . 9 m / s ) , and İstanbul ( 4 . 5 m / s ) .

Hospital beds are placed in patient rooms or units where patients are provided with a minimum of 24 h of medical care ( MoH 2018 ) . According to reports of Turkstat ( 2018a ) , the average hospital bed number is 2 . 76 , and the aver - age physician number is 1 . 5 per 1000 residents in Turkey ( Fig . 8 ) . Life index , produced by the Turkish Statistical Institute based on the OECD Better Life Index , is a study for monitor - ing and comparing people’s living conditions under objec - tive and subjective criteria at a local level . This composite index includes 11 leading indicators and 41 sub - indicators at province - based statistics ( Turkstat 2015 ) . However , the primary indicators are housing , career , income and wealth , education , health , safety , environment , civil engagement , social life , access to infrastructure services , and life satisfac - tion ; just five of these indicators have been used in this study to investigate their relationship with COVID - 19 patient den - sity . Health index is calculated by some fundamental fac - tors such as satisfaction rate about health infrastructure and public health services available in the cities . The average health index is 0 . 59 for Turkey . Income and wealth index is calculated by average daily earnings , savings deposit per capita , job satisfaction rate , and percentage of households in the lower - , middle - , and higher - income levels . The aver - age income and wealth index is 0 . 40 for Turkey . Education index includes the percentage of higher education gradu - ates , schooling ratio of kindergartens , and average points of necessary examinations like the transition to secondary and higher education . The average education index is 0 . 53 for Turkey . Environment index includes active green area per km 2 , percentage of the population receiving waste ser - vices , satisfaction rate with municipal cleaning services , and infrastructure . The average environment index is 0 . 59 for Turkey . Social life index is another leading indicator , Fig . 7 Annual average wind speed distribution map of Turkey ( Süzek 2007 ; World Bank Group , 2021 ) Fig . 8 Spatial distribution of health infrastructure . a Number of hospital beds . b Physician number per 1000 people in Turkey 401 Page 8 of 16 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 including cinema and theater audience ratio , satisfaction rate with social life and social relations , and shopping mall area per thousand people . The average social life index is 0 . 42 for Turkey . Life satisfaction ratio shows residents’ happiness level about their living standards in the provinces where they live . The average life satisfaction ratio is 61 . 2 % for Turkey ( Turkstat 2016 ) . Figure 9 depicts the spatial distribution maps of these indexes in Turkey . After defining , visualizing , and understanding all the variables , a multiple linear regression analysis will be per - formed to explore relationships between dependent and independent variables to understand the factors behind observed spatial patterns of COVID - 19 . However , firstly , it is required to understand the characteristics of the data for further steps . For this purpose , descriptive statistics of all the variables have been prepared in SPSS software and are given in Table 3 . Descriptive statistics are essential to understand that the data is normally distributed or not . For a normal distribu - tion , the central tendency measures like mean and median values must be close to each other as much as possible . Also , smaller standard deviation values mean less spread out of the observations . In addition , if kurtosis and skew - ness values are between − 1 and + 1 , that means distribution is inside the range of normality . The degree and direction of asymmetry in the dataset are measured by skewness . If the skewness value is zero , that means a perfectly normal dis - tribution . If the skewness value is positive , the mean value is more than the median in the dataset , and vice versa . By kurtosis value , which is a measure of tail extremity , it is possible to see there are outliers in a distribution or not . Positive and negative kurtosis values show the occurrence of outliers in the dataset ( UCLA 2021 ) . Table 3 presents that , although the datasets of the dependent variable and most of the other variables are trustworthy , some independent vari - ables such as household size , population density , and GDP are not entirely reliable due to lack of data . Some scatterplot diagrams have been prepared to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables ; to detect the outliers , if any ; and to determine whether a relationship is linear or not ( Fig . 10 ) . The scatterplots in Fig . 10 reveal that there may be a positive association between the incidence rate and popu - lation density , median age , GDP , humidity , different types Fig . 9 Life index distribution in Turkey . a Health . b Income and wealth . c Education . d Environment . e Social life . f Life satisfaction ratio Page 9 of 16 401 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 of well - being indexes , and number of hospital beds . There may be moderate or almost no relationship between the dependent variable and urbanization level , wind speed , air quality index , life satisfaction ratio , and physician number . On the other hand , sunshine duration , average temperature , and household size show a negative linear relationship with the incidence rates . For a better understanding , the Pearson correlation coefficient of each independent variable has been calculated to measure the statistical relationship , summa - rized in Table 4 . The Pearson correlation coefficient changes between − 1 and + 1 , where − 1 indicates a perfect negative correlation while + 1 means a perfect positive correlation , and 0 indi - cates no relationship between the variables . A coefficient value between ± 0 . 5 and ± 1 states a strong correlation , a value between ± 0 . 3 and ± 0 . 49 means moderate correla - tion , and a value under ± 0 . 29 indicates small correlation ( Statistics Solutions 2021 ) . Table 4 presents that sunshine duration and household size have the strongest correlation with the incidence rates . Income level , education index , and median age variables seem like the other strongly cor - related factors . Moreover , correlation is significant for all these variables at the 0 . 01 level . GDP , humidity , health index , environment , social life , and number of hospital beds show a moderate correlation while the other variables have small or no correlation with COVID - 19 incidence rates . Descriptive statistics , scatterplot diagrams , and cor - relation coefficients suggest that model estimates are not biased and have been conducive to understand the data’s characteristics and associations between dependent and independent variables . In addition , the data seems well founded for the robustness and accuracy of the regres - sion model . This study has only one dependent variable and eighteen predictors , so a multiple linear regression analysis has been conducted in SPSS software . Table 5 summarizes the model . In Table 5 , R is the multiple correlation coefficient , and its value ( 0 . 827 ) indicates a good level of prediction for the dependent variable . R 2 value ( 0 . 685 ) means that our explora - tory variables explain 68 . 5 % of the variability of COVID - 19 incidence rates , while 31 . 5 % of the variation occurs due to other factors not included in this model . Nevertheless , the model is effective enough to determine the relationship . The adjusted R 2 value ( 0 . 593 ) means the predictors explain true 59 . 3 % of the variation in the outcome variable in the model . The standard error of the estimate value ( 808 , 666 ) , also called the root mean square error , seems higher than average , but it is acceptable due to the lack of data and sam - ple size used in the study . To sum up , the model summary table is satisfactory , and the database used in the study is plausible . Therefore , as the next step , the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) tool has been used to test whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of independent groups or not .

The F ratio is important to see if the overall regression model is a good fit for the data or not . Here , the F ratio value ( 7 . 48 ) is greater than 1 and shows that the exploratory variables statistically Table 3 Descriptive statistics of variables Variables Mean SD Median Min Max Kurtosis Skewness COVID - 19 incidence rate 3037 1268 3003 521 5959 − 0 . 55 0 . 22 Population density 130 . 2 318 . 7 63 11 . 2 2842 67 . 5 7 . 93 Urbanization level 68 . 4 23 . 75 63 . 40 22 . 40 100 − 1 . 30 − 0 . 01 Median age 10 . 16 3 . 46 10 . 90 3 . 20 18 . 3 − 0 . 57 − 0 . 18 Household size 3 . 45 0 . 75 3 . 18 2 . 63 6 . 11 1 . 99 1 . 60 GDP 7250 2571 6745 3204 16 , 791 2 . 79 1 . 32 Avg . temperature 13 . 03 3 . 25 13 . 10 3 . 60 19 . 1 0 . 43 − 0 . 41 Humidity 66 6 . 75 65 48 81 − 0 . 28 0 . 24 Annual sunshine duration 2688 283 . 6 2690 2124 3508 − 0 . 31 0 . 12 Avg . wind speed ( m / s ) 2 . 70 0 . 93 2 . 56 1 . 24 6 . 56 2 . 76 1 . 23 Air quality index 45 . 6 21 . 4 41 2 116 1 . 07 0 . 63 Health index 0 . 59 0 . 11 0 . 62 0 . 30 0 . 84 0 . 24 − 0 . 61 Income and wealth index 0 . 40 0 . 17 0 . 44 0 . 02 0 . 88 − 0 . 03 − 0 . 22 Education index 0 . 53 0 . 14 0 . 57 0 . 10 0 . 75 0 . 89 − 1 . 12 Environment index 0 . 59 0 . 12 0 . 61 0 . 20 0 . 81 1 . 17 − 1 . 03 Social life index 0 . 42 0 . 12 0 . 41 0 . 19 0 . 67 − 0 . 72 0 . 15 Life satisfaction ratio 61 7 . 53 60 . 4 42 77 . 7 − 0 . 27 0 . 15 No . of hospital beds 2 . 76 0 . 82 2 . 60 1 . 20 5 . 02 0 . 39 0 . 76 Physician no 1 . 5 0 . 57 1 1 3 − 0 . 63 0 . 59 401 Page 10 of 16 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 significantly predict the COVID - 19 incidence rates . Table 7 summarizes the analysis results for coefficients . The constant value ( 732 . 25 ) is the predicted value for the dependent variable . That means we can expect the COVID - 19 incidence rate to be 732 . 25 anywhere in Turkey . The B column includes the values for predicting the dependent var - iable from the exploratory variables in the regression equa - tion . In the B column , a 1 - unit increase in any positive vari - able causes an increase in the COVID - 19 incidence rate , but each negative value in the column causes a reduction in the dependent variable . The beta weight ( beta column ) values are the standardized coefficients , and they measure how much the outcome variable changes in standard deviations when the exploratory variable is changed by 1 standard deviation ( Dhakal 2018 ) . Hence , the education index ( 0 . 39 ) , median age ( 0 . 39 ) , and urbanization level ( 0 . 38 ) seem like the high - est contributing predictors to explain COVID - 19 incident rates . Zero - order correlation values show the bivariate cor - relation between the dependent and independent variables . The highest values in this column , sunshine duration value ( − 0 . 61 ) and household size value ( − 0 . 60 ) , are the direct effect of these variables on COVID - 19 incidence rates . Mul - ticollinearity check is also substantial for a well - specified regression model . Dhakal ( 2018 ) says that if the VIF value is higher than 10 or the tolerance value is lower than 0 . 1 , there is a multicollinearity problem . That means just median age and household size seem as the problematical predic - tors in the model in terms of multicollinearity , which means Fig . 10 Scatterplots showing the association between dependent and independent variables Page 11 of 16 401 Arab J Geosci ( 2022 ) 15 : 401 1 3 there is a very high relationship between these two variables . Therefore , the median age has been excluded from the final regression model . In the most important column , signifi - cance values show that urbanization level ( p ( 0 . 006 ) < 0 . 05 ) , average temperature ( p ( 0 . 01 ) < 0 . 05 ) , sunshine duration ( p ( 0 . 029 ) < 0 . 05 ) , wind speed ( p ( 0 . 038 ) < 0 . 05 ) , and educa - tion index ( p ( 0 . 036 ) < 0 . 05 ) are statistically significant to be used in the model while the others are not more useful in the model . The analyses show that the regression model is not specified well enough , and there is multicollinearity among some of the variables . Thus , a final regression model has been tested by using only the statistically significant explora - tory predictors . Table 8 gives the model summary of the final regression analysis . R value ( 0 . 755 ) indicates a good level of prediction for the dependent variable . R 2 value ( 0 . 570 ) indicates that these five variables explain 57 % of the variability of COVID - 19 incidence rates , while 43 % of the variation is because of other factors not included in this study . Adjusted R 2 value ( 0 . 542 ) means true 54 . 2 % of the variation in the COVID - 19 incidence rate is explained by the predictors in the final model . As an additional and final analysis , spatial depend - ency among the COVID - 19 incidence rate observations was tested using the ArcGIS Spatial Autocorrelation ( Global Moran’s I ) tool , and a statistically significant spatial cluster pattern was found ( Fig . 11 ) . In Fig . 11 , the z - score is + 7 . 20 , which means the ana - lyzed attributes are not randomly distributed among the fea - tures in the area , and COVID - 19 incident rates are clustered in some regions in Turkey . Also , the p value ( significance level ) in the analysis is less than 0 . 01 and seems statistically significant , and the regression model used in this study has a confidence level of 99 % . That means the model is genuinely specified , and results can be trusted . Discussion The distribution of COVID - 19 incidence rates was examined for Turkey to understand how a province’s spatial and non - spatial structure can regulate the overall pattern , and the results were found to be heterogeneous across Turkey . While some regions have higher incidence rates than usual , some regions have lower rates than expected . This clustered dis - tribution could be attributed to many corresponding factors such as geographical , physical , environmental , sociocultural , socioeconomical , demographic , and meteorological differ - ences among the provinces . A multiple linear regression analysis has been conducted to determine the relationship between COVID - 19 incidence rates and the chosen explana - tory variables . Based on the COVID - 19 incidence rate distri - bution map and spatial autocorrelation results , it seems that Marmara , Mid - Black Sea , and Eastern Black Sea regions have the highest incidence rates while Southeast Anatolia and south part of Eastern Anatolia regions have the lowest rates as clustered . For instance , the incidence rate ( cases per 100 , 000 people ) was found maximum in İstanbul , Kırklareli , Çanakkale , Yalova , Tekirdağ , Kocaeli ( Marmara Region ) , and Samsun , Giresun , Ordu , and Rize ( Middle and Eastern Black Sea ) , while the incidence rate was found minimum in Mardin , Şanlıurfa , Siirt ( Southeast Anatolia Region ) , and Şırnak , Hakkâri , and Van ( south part of Eastern Anatolia Region ) provinces .

These statistical results indicate that the rate of COVID - 19 incidences must be considered for unbiased estimation and compelling interpretation of the results . Statistical results of this study show that : – As the urbanization ratio of cities increases , the COVID - 19 incidence rate increases . – As the education index increases , the COVID - 19 inci - dence rate increases , too . – As the sunshine duration increases , the COVID - 19 inci - dence rate decreases . – As the average temperature increases , the COVID - 19 incidence rate decreases . – As the wind speed increases , the COVID - 19 incidence rate increases . Transmission of the virus increases with the social and spa - tial interaction between people , so urbanized areas are favora - ble environments for the spread of outbreaks because of their higher building and population density . So , the positive associa - tion between the urbanization ratio and the incidence rates is reasonable and acceptable . Furthermore , educated people gen - erally live in bigger cities such as İstanbul , İzmir , and Ankara , which are significant attraction points . The percentage of higher education graduates , schooling ratio of kindergartens , univer - sity number , and average points of necessary examinations like the transition to secondary and higher education are higher in these cities , too . Thus , the positive correlation between the edu - cation index and the incidence rate makes sense since educated people prefer to live in urbanized areas . Many recent studies report that daily sunshine duration and average air temperature negatively correlate with COVID - 19 incident rates . In addition , many kinds of research in different parts of the world show that wind increases virus spread directly by increasing air circula - tion among people , cities , and regions . Conclusion In conclusion , this study has tested eighteen potential factors on the COVID - 19 incidence rate .

As a result , it is recognized that these five factors can explain 57 % of the variability of COVID - 19 incidence rates in Turkey , while 43 % of the variation is due to other factors not included in this study . That means after this study and thousands of other related studies , COVID - 19 still stands as a complex phenomenon that is not fully understood , and its causes have not been entirely resolved . Today , billions of people continue liv - ing together in cities without knowing the fundamental dynamics of this virus , but we have to find out all the reasons and solutions as soon as possible to finish this outbreak . We have to comprehend that an alternative life - style emerging toward the COVID - 19 pandemic is not a location - independent phenomenon . All human beings and most of their activities are related to space , so all occupational groups dealing with space , especially urban planners , must think about the effects of social and spatial urban life on the disease’s spread . However , the study’s model and the results are trustworthy ; the eighteen fac - tors examined in this study do not explain all reasons for different spread rates of COVID - 19 in different regions . This complex phenomenon cannot be explained by a single discipline such as medicine , sociology , urban planning , or psychology . All human - related disciplines must combine their data , experience , and knowledge to identify a col - lectively exhaustive list of significant factors affecting the spread rates . Governments and non - governmental organi - zations , public and private sectors , universities , and all kinds of actors must unite their forces against COVID - 19 disease to solve the current problems and to design the post - pandemic cities of the near future .
