Upon initial attachment , chromosomes un - dergo oscillatory movements to reach metaphase . Once a chromosome is correctly attached and posi - tioned , these oscillatory movements are reduced by the motor protein Kif18A , and loss of Kif18A results in chromosome hyper - oscillations . By using a haploid genetic approach , we found that loss of Kif18A is lethal in wild - type human HAP1 cells , but not in SAC - deﬁcient HAP1 cells . Unexpectedly , we found that the hyper - oscillations after Kif18A loss are not associated with chromosome missegrega - tions . Rather , we found that loss of Kif18A results in a loss of tension across a subset of kinetochores accompanying SAC activation . Strikingly , the SAC - active kinetochores appear to have established fully functional kinetochore - microtubule ( k - Mt ) attach - ments , allowing proper chromosome segregation . These ﬁndings shed new light on the role of Kif18A in chromosome segregation and demonstrate that the SAC can be activated at kinetochores that are occupied by fully functional k - Mts that lack tension . INTRODUCTION Missegregation of chromosomes compromises cellular ﬁtness and drives chromosomal instability , a major hallmark of cancer cells [ 1 ] . To ensure proper chromosome segregation , the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) has evolved to delay anaphase onset until all paired sister chromatids are properly aligned at the metaphase plate [ 2 ] . It is well established that SAC activation can occur at unattached kinetochores [ 2 , 3 ] , as unattached ki - netochores recruit a variety of checkpoint proteins , such as Mad1 and Mad2 , and the checkpoint kinases Mps1 and Bub1 [ 3 – 5 ] . These players act together to produce a soluble complex known as the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) , which consists of Cdc20 bound to Mad2 , BubR1 , and Bub3 [ 6 , 7 ] . Cdc20 is an essential co - factor of the multi - subunit E3 ligase anaphase - pro - moting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) , and incorporation of Cdc20 in the MCC renders it incapable of activating the APC / C [ 8 ] , thereby preventing premature chromatid separation [ 9 ] . SAC inactivation occurs when correct kinetochore - microtubule ( k - Mt ) attachments displace the various checkpoint proteins from the kinetochore , so that MCC production will cease and Cdc20 can activate the APC / C [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] , resulting in anaphase onset . Thus , attached kinetochores silence the SAC . However , attachment of a microtubule to a kinetochore does not always produce a correct attachment . Erroneous k - Mt attachments can occur , for example , when both sister kinetochores become attached to the same pole or a single kinetochore is attached to both poles of the mitotic spindle [ 12 – 14 ] . Whether erroneously attached kinetochores can directly promote MCC production has been a long - standing debate . What has become clear is that , due to physical constraints , erroneously attached k - Mts fail to produce tension across sister kinetochores [ 15 ] . This lack of tension is sensed by the Aurora B kinase , which phosphorylates outer kinetochore components involved in microtubule attachment [ 16 ] . This is thought to make erroneous attachments unstable , and therefore they are easily converted back to unattached kinetochores [ 16 ] . Thus , it is clear that ten - sion plays a critical role in accurate chromatid segregation , but whether the lack of tension itself can directly promote SAC activity remains an unresolved issue . The leading view is that the SAC is activated by unattached kinetochores and that lack of tension causes SAC activation as it results in the displacement of attached microtubules through Aurora B activity [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 17 – 20 ] . Nonetheless , in some cases , a tension defect is thought to play a direct role in SAC activation . For example , it has been suggested that tension defects delay anaphase onset in budding yeast by interfering with SAC silencing [ 21 ] . Besides , there are multiple additional studies that point toward a direct role for tension defects in SAC activity [ 22 – 24 ] . However , direct evidence for this model is still lacking . We recently obtained full Mad1 and Mad2 ( both essential pro - teins for SAC function ) knockout cell lines in a human haploid cell line ( HAP1 ) and used these SAC - deﬁcient cells to perform syn - thetic lethality screens in order to identify factors that mediate chromosome congression in human cells [ 25 , 26 ] . Interestingly , Current Biology 28 , 2685 – 2696 , September 10 , 2018 ª 2018 The Author ( s ) . Published by Elsevier Ltd . 2685 This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc - nd / 4 . 0 / ) . besides several synthetic lethal interactions with SAC deﬁciency , we also identiﬁed two synthetic viable interactions . This implied that two essential genes , KIF18A and SPAG5 ( from this point on referred to as Astrin ) , become non - essential in a SAC - deﬁcient setting . This surprising ﬁnding suggested an unknown link be - tween these proteins and the SAC . RESULTS The Requirement of Kif18A and Astrin for Cell Viability Is Rescued by SAC Deﬁciency In order to identify novel genes with functions in chromosome congression , parallel screens were performed in D Mad1 and D Mad2 HAP1 cells to identify genes required for optimal ﬁtness of cells lacking a functional SAC [ 26 ] . These screens use inser - tional mutagenesis by genome - wide integration of a gene trap in near - haploid HAP1 cells , which are derived from the KBM - 7 cell line [ 25 ] . Besides several synthetic lethal interactions [ 26 ] , two synthetic viable interactions were identiﬁed , KIF18A and ASTRIN ( Figures 1A and 1B ) , indicating that these genes become non - essential in a SAC - deﬁcient background . The strongest synthetic viable interactor was Kif18A , a plus - end directed microtubule motor protein that either directly depo - lymerizes microtubules or inhibits microtubule polymerization [ 27 , 28 ] . As Kif18A showed the most prominent synthetic viable interaction , we ﬁrst focused on establishing the interaction between Kif18A loss and SAC activity . Kif18A depletion was previously linked to chromosome hyper - oscillations , alignment defects , segregation errors , and elongated mitotic spindles [ 27 , 29 , 30 ] . Given the proposed role for Kif18A in chromosome alignment , we were surprised to ﬁnd Kif18A as non - essential in a SAC - deﬁcient setting . If loss of Kif18A leads to alignment de - fects that compromise cell viability , we would expect viability to be even further compromised in SAC - deﬁcient cells , as the percentage of missegregations would be expected to increase . Instead , we found the opposite interaction , suggesting that A B 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 KIF18A ASTRIN % S en s e I n s e r t i on s WT ∆ MAD1 ∆ MAD2 C ∆ MAD2 ASTRINKIF18A 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 1 2 3 4 5 % S en s e I n s e r t i on s log10 ( number of insertions ) WT 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 1 2 3 4 5 % S en s e I n s e r t i on s log10 ( number of insertions ) ASTRINKIF18A ∆ MAD1 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 1 2 3 4 5 % S en s e I n s e r t i on s log10 ( number of insertions ) ASTRINKIF18A Synthetic viable hits Viability screen Viability screen Viability screen W T ∆ M A D 2 siNT siKif18A 0 50 100 150 W T + s i N T W T + s i K i f 18 A ∆ M A D 2 + s i N T ∆ M A D 2 + s i K i f 18 A Colony formation I n t en s i t y ( A .

See also Figures S1 and S4 . 2686 Current Biology 28 , 2685 – 2696 , September 10 , 2018 loss of Kif18A does not perturb correct chromosome segrega - tion . Rather , loss of Kif18A somehow promotes the inhibition of cell growth through an unknown interaction with the SAC . There - fore , we decided to investigate this unexpected result in more detail . As a ﬁrst conﬁrmation of our screen , we demonstrated that small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated depletion of Kif18A ( Fig - ure S1A ) speciﬁcally perturbed colony outgrowth in wild - type ( WT ) HAP1 cells , but not in D Mad2 HAP1 cells ( Figure 1C ) . In line with these observations , the Kif18A - depleted cultures dis - played an increased mitotic index ( Figure S1C ) , consistent with previous results in other cell types [ 27 , 29 ] . Lethality of Kif18A Loss Is Caused by a Prolonged Mitotic Arrest To understand the cause of the mitotic enrichment observed in Kif18A - depleted cells and the observed rescue of viability in the SAC - deﬁcient cells , we performed live - cell imaging experi - ments . We observed that the siKif18A - depleted cells indeed displayed hyper - oscillations and spent an unusually long time in mitosis , often followed by cell death as observed by hyper - condensation and fragmentation of the DNA ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Interestingly , the behavior of siKif18A - depleted cells was rather heterogeneous ; although a subset of siKif18A - depleted cells displayed near - normal timing in mitosis , there was also a notable population of siKif18A - depleted cells that displayed a prominent mitotic delay followed by slippage [ 31 ] and / or cell death ( Figure 2A ) . Interestingly , the subpopulation of Kif18A - depleted cells that reached anaphase did not display an increase in missegregations when compared to WT HAP1 cells ( Figures 2B and 2C ; Videos S1 and S2 ) , despite the fact that loss of Kif18A has previously been associated with chro - mosome segregation errors [ 29 , 30 ] . Besides , as we found Kif18A loss to be non - lethal in a SAC - deﬁcient background , this would also hint that Kif18A loss does not cause segrega - tion defects . To test the effect of SAC deﬁciency on the pheno - type seen upon Kif18A loss in more detail , we generated double - knockouts for Kif18A and Mad2 ( Figures 2D and S1B ; single Kif18A knockouts could not be obtained as predicted by the screen results in Figure 1 and the mitotic arrest in Fig - ure 2A ) . Importantly , the mitotic delay as well as mitotic cell death , but not the chromosome oscillations ( Video S3 ) , were completely rescued in two independent double - knockout clones for Kif18A and Mad2 ( D Mad2 D Kif18A _ A1 and _ B1 ) , and we observed a similar mitotic timing and doubling time compared to D Mad2 cells ( Figures 2A and 2E ) . Moreover , the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells showed a mild increase in segregation er - rors as compared to the parental HAP1 cells , which was similar to the increased missegregations observed in the D Mad2 cells ( Figure 2C ) . Therefore , this increase could be attributed to Mad2 loss . Importantly , as predicted by the screens , we could conﬁrm these results in D Mad1 and D Mad1 D Kif18A cells ( Fig - ure S2 ) . In order to rule out minor segregation defects in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells , we quantiﬁed karyotypes with chromo - some spreads . When karyotyping WT HAP1 cells , D Mad2 cells , and D Mad2 D Kif18A cells , no signiﬁcant differences were found in chromosome gains or losses ( Figure S1D ) . Thus , even in the absence of the SAC , the segregation errors do not increase upon Kif18A loss , implying that Kif18A is not required for normal chromosome segregation . This observation contradicts previous ﬁndings , where Kif18A depletion resulted in increased chromosome segregation errors [ 29 , 30 ] . Moreover , our ﬁnd - ings were surprising as Kif18A - depleted cells never seem to fully reach alignment due to chromosome hyper - oscillations . To rule out the possibility of knockout adaptation leading to proper chromosome segregation in the D Mad2 D Kif18A dou - ble - knockout cells , we sought to acutely reactivate the SAC in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells . To this end , we generated a GFP - T2A - Mad2 cell line co - expressing GFP and Mad2 from the same vector , where we could induce the expression of Mad2 by the addition of doxycycline ( DOX ) ( Figure 3A ) . Mad2 - expressing cells were selected based on GFP positivity , which were then used for the subsequent experiments . To test whether the re - expression of Mad2 could completely rescue the SAC defect in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells , we treated both WT HAP1 and D Mad2 D Kif18A cells expressing the DOX - induc - ible Mad2 with nocodazole . As expected , WT HAP1 cells treated with nocodazole arrested in mitosis , although the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells failed to do so ( Figure 3B ) . Expression of GFP - T2A - Mad2 did not have any effect on the mitotic arrest observed in the WT HAP1 cells ( Figure 3B ; WT + DOX ) . Impor - tantly , expression of GFP - T2A - Mad2 in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells produced a nocodazole - induced mitotic arrest that was indistinguishable from the arrest observed in the WT HAP1 cells ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , re - expression of Mad2 completely restored SAC function in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells . We next examined the effect of Mad2 ( re - ) expression on cell division by live - cell imaging . The induced expression of GFP - T2A - Mad2 in WT cells slightly increased the average time spent in mitosis , whereas re - expression of Mad2 in the D Mad2 cells rescued the time spent in mitosis to the same extent as WT cells ( Figure 3C ) . Most importantly , GFP - T2A - Mad2 re - expression in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells caused a signiﬁcant fraction of the cells to arrest in mitosis , eventually followed by mitotic cell death ( Fig - ure 3C ) . Besides the induction of a mitotic arrest , the re - expres - sion of Mad2 in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells also reduced the percentage of segregation errors seen in the D Mad2 background ( Figure 3D ) , further conﬁrming that the segregation errors observed in the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells are entirely due to loss of Mad2 , not loss of Kif18A . Finally , to test whether the pleiotropic response to the acute restoration of SAC function was sufﬁcient to reduce cell viability , we measured the amount of GFP - T2A - Mad2 - expressing ( GFP - positive ) cells over multiple days by ﬂuo - rescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) ( Figure 3E ) . We found that re - expression of Mad2 did not interfere with cell viability in WT or in D Mad2 cells but did progressively reduce viability of the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells ( Figure 3E ) . This shows that , although Kif18A loss will only cause a subset of the mitotic cells to die , this is sufﬁcient to reduce the long - term viability of the whole cell population . Interestingly , the heterogeneity in the cellular response to loss of Kif18A by re - expressing Mad2 was very similar to what we observed in WT HAP1 cells depleted of Kif18A using siRNA ( compare Figures 2A and 3C ) . This indicates that the heterogeneity is intrinsic to the loss of Kif18A and not due to an incomplete depletion of the protein in a subset of cells . Additionally , this means that the viability of the D Mad2 D Kif18A cells is not due to adaptation but reﬂects a real SAC - dependent essentiality .

This mitotic delay and the concurring cell death can be rescued by disabling SAC activity , in which case cells are viable with no apparent defects in chromosome segre - gation . Importantly , we could validate these ﬁndings in HeLa cells , the cell type used in previous Kif18A studies ( Figures S3A and S3B ) [ 29 , 32 ] . It is interesting to note that loss of Kif18A results in SAC activation , although without a functional SAC , its loss does not lead to major problems in chromosome segregation . We therefore investigated the underlying cause for the observed SAC activation in Kif18A - deﬁcient cells . DOX - + - + - + - + A1 B1 WT pCW _ GFP - T2A - Mad2 Δ Mad2 GFP Mad2 , s . e .

Loss of Kif18A Reduces Tension at Kinetochores To investigate why loss of Kif18A results in SAC activation , we ﬁrst investigated whether the SAC is activated at all or only at a subset of kinetochores . To test this , we quantiﬁed the number of Mad1 - positivekinetochoresbyimmunoﬂuo - rescence microscopy in WT HAP1 cells , si - Kif18A - depleted cells , and the D Kif18A - D Mad2 double - knockout clones . As WT HAP1 cells display limited checkpoint activ - ity ( Figure 4B ) , we activated the SAC in WT HAP1 cells as a control by treating them with a low dose of nocodazole to interfere directly with k - Mt stability or an Eg5 inhibitor to interfere indirectly with k - Mt stability by creating a situation where tension cannot be established because the spindle poles are clustered . As anticipated , loss of Kif18A produced a clear increase in the number of Mad1 - positive kinetochores in both si - Kif18A - depleted HAP1 cells and the D Kif18A - D Mad2 double - knockout clones ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Importantly , only a subset of kinetochores was Mad1 positive in the cells lacking Kif18A , suggesting that the SACisonlyactivatedatspeciﬁc kinetochores . TheMad1 - pos - itive kinetochores seen in the cells lacking Kif18A seemed to be mostly located outside of the main chromosome pack , in line with previous observations [ 27 ] . Because previous studies showed that Kif18A depletion could result in a loss of tension across sister kinetochores [ 27 , 33 ] , we investigated whether loss of Kif18A indeed leads to tension defects in our setting . For this analysis , we made a distinction between Mad1 - negative and Mad1 - positive kinetochores . The inter - kinetochore distance of Mad1 - negative kinetochore pairs in Kif18A - depleted and D Mad2 D Kif18A cells was the same as Current Biology 28 , 2685 – 2696 , September 10 , 2018 2689 W T + E g5 i B C E F W T s i N T W T s i K i f 18 A Mad1 Crest W T + s i N T W T + E g5 i W T + no c oda z o l e W T + s i K i f 18 A Δ M ad2 Δ K i f 18 A _ A 1 Δ M ad2 Δ K i f 18 A _ B 1 Mad1 - positivity per cell + MG132 A 0 50 100 1 - 3 4 - 10 > 10 75 25 125 M ad1 - po s i t i v e c e ll s ( % ) G Astrin Merge + DAPI Astrin levels Astrin levels A s t r i n / C r e s t i n t en s i t y ( A .

This implies that these kinetochores are all properly attached to the mitotic spindle or at least the spindle is able to generate the same amount of force on these attachments . In contrast , the Mad1 - positive kinetochores in the control samples ( Eg5 inhibitor or nocodazole treatment ) , siKif18A - depleted and D Mad2 D Kif18A cells , displayed a clear decrease in inter - kineto - chore distance compared to Mad1 - negative kinetochores ( Fig - ure 4C ) . As previous work indicated that the intra - kinetochore stretch is more important for SAC inactivation than inter - kineto - chore distance [ 34 ] , we also measured the intra - kinetochore dis - tance in the same conditions as Figure 4C by performing immu - noﬂuorescent staining of the outer kinetochore component Hec1 , the inner kinetochore component CENP - C , and BubR1 as a marker for checkpoint activation . Here , we ﬁnd a similar trend where checkpoint - active ( BubR1 - positive ) kinetochores display decreased intra - kinetochore distance ( Figure 4D ) . As an independent measure of tension , we looked at the localization of astrin , which is recruited to kinetochores once tension is es - tablished and Aurora B activity is reduced [ 35 ] . Both in WT HAP1 and siKif18A - depleted cells , there was a strong correlation between Mad1 positivity and astrin negativity ( Figures 4E – 4G ) , again indicating that checkpoint - active kinetochores in Kif18A - depleted cells are under low tension . In addition , the fact that we ﬁnd astrin on kinetochores in cells lacking Kif18A indicates that astrin is not recruited by Kif18A , as previously proposed [ 30 ] . Together , our data conﬁrm the previously observed tension defects upon loss of Kif18A [ 27 , 33 ] . Kinetochores of Kif18A - Depleted Cells Show SAC Activation in the Presence of Kinetochore - Microtubule Attachments In summary , our data thus far show that loss of Kif18A results in chromosome oscillations and a loss of tension , resulting in SAC activation . However , when the SAC is inhibited , Kif18A cells do not display chromosome segregation errors . This is quite unex - pected , as it suggests that , despite the recruitment of SAC proteins , kinetochores in Kif18A - depleted cells are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle . To investigate this in more detail , we visualized the kinetochore - attachment status by immunoﬂu - orescence microscopy . SAC - active kinetochores were selected based on Mad1 positivity . As expected , we observed that Mad1 - negative kinetochores in WT HAP1 cells display a k - Mt attach - ment ( Figure 5A ) . In addition , checkpoint activation in WT HAP1 cells through Eg5 inhibition or nocodazole treatment showed the expected result of Mad1 positivity at unattached kinetochores ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . In striking contrast , the major - ity of Mad1 - positive kinetochores in siKif18A - depleted and D Mad2 D Kif18A cells did display a k - Mt attachment ( Figures 5A , 5B , S3C , and S3D ) . Previous work has proposed that Mps1 and microtubules bind competitively to kinetochores [ 36 , 37 ] , supporting the idea that only a lack of attachment is able to activate the SAC through Mps1 localization . However , other work has shown that Mps1 can be recruited to tension - less microtubule - bound kinetochores [ 36 ] . As Mps1 is an up - stream factor for Mad1 recruitment , we also visualized the attachment status of Mps1 - positive kinetochores in control - depleted and Kif18A - depleted HAP1 cells ( Figures S1E – S1G ) . Here , we again ﬁnd that the majority of the checkpoint - signaling kinetochores in Kif18A - depleted cells harbor a microtubule attachment . This , together with our previous data , implies that the kinetochores that signal to the SAC in Kif18A - deﬁcient cells are attached to the spindle despite the fact that they lack tension . Thus , these data imply that the SAC can be active even when a microtubule attachment is present . But if there are still microtubule attachments present , how is the lack of tension translated into SAC activation ? One could argue that not all of the microtubule - binding sites present at the single kinetochore are occupied [ 37 , 38 ] . Thus , the reduced tension could be both a cause and a consequence of a relative reduction in the total number of microtubules bound per kineto - chore , resulting in a number of unoccupied microtubule - binding sites that could activate the SAC . In an effort to resolve this , we determined the quality of the microtubule attachments by measuring the width and intensity of the microtubule bundles at Mad1 - positive and Mad1 - negative kinetochores in all previ - ously described settings ( Figure 5C ) . In untreated , Eg5 - inhibi - tor - treated and low - dose - nocodazole - treated WT cells , very dense microtubule staining was exclusively observed adjacent to Mad1 - negative kinetochores , suggesting they are attached by a k - ﬁber . Strikingly , in Kif18A - deﬁcient cells , the Mad1 - posi - tive and Mad1 - negative kinetochores displayed a similar inten - sity of microtubule staining , suggesting that the Mad1 - positive kinetochores contain just as many microtubules as the Mad1 - negative kinetochores ( Figure 5C ) . This could explain why D Mad2 D Kif18A cells exhibit normal chromosome segregation . More importantly , these results imply that , under speciﬁc condi - tions , the SAC can be active in response to loss of tension , without any evident loss of attachment . Loss of Astrin Phenocopies Loss of Kif18A Besides Kif18A , we also found astrin as a synthetic viable inter - actor with SAC deﬁciency . Astrin is found to localize to kineto - chores upon tension generation [ 35 ] and is thought to be needed for stabilization of k - Mt attachments , which are needed to enable SAC silencing and proper chromosome segregation [ 30 ] . As we found both Kif18A and astrin to be synthetic viable with Mad1 / Mad2 loss , both proteins might inﬂuence chromosomal ( D ) Measurementsofintra - KT distance ofWT HAP1cellstreatedwithsiNT ( 48hr ) , Eg5inhibitorSTLC ( 10 m M ; 4hr ) , nocodazole ( 50nM ; 4hr ) , D Mad2 D Kif18A _ A1 , and D Mad2 D Kif18A _ B1 .

Indeed , astrin - depleted cells showed a mitotic arrest similar to Kif18A - depleted cells and displayed chromosomal oscillations ( Figures S4A and S4B ; Videos S4 and S5 ) . No signiﬁcant in - crease in segregation errors were found ( Figure S4C ; Video S4 ) , and the Mad1 - positive kinetochores were mostly attached by microtubules ( Figures S4D – S4F ) . These astrin phenotypes seemed to be a bit milder than the phenotypes seen after Kif18A depletion but do indicate that astrin , like Kif18A , results in SAC activity at kinetochores under low tension that are prop - erly attached to the mitotic spindle . DISCUSSION Previous studies have shown that loss of Kif18A results in align - ment problems , attributed to severe chromosome oscillations [ 27 , 29 , 30 , 39 , 40 ] . These alignment problems are associated with a prolonged mitotic duration that is fully dependent on the SAC [ 27 , 29 ] . Here , we show that loss of Kif18A is not compatible with cell viability in human HAP1 cells .

See also Figures S1 , S3 , and S4 . that lethality of Kif18A loss is rescued by deletion of Mad1 or Mad2 , indicating that cell death in Kif18A - deﬁcient cells is a consequence of ( persistent ) SAC activa - tion . Indeed , we could show that loss of Mad2 prevents the mitotic cell death we see after Kif18A depletion . Surprisingly , combined loss of Kif18A and Mad2 did not produce high rates of segregation er - rors . This was unexpected in light of the previous observations , where loss of Kif18A caused problems in chromosome alignment . Because the missegregation rates in D Mad2 can be attributed to SAC deﬁciency , and the loss of Kif18A leads to a mitotic arrest and not to increased misse - gregations , it is unlikely that the Mad2 - deﬁcient background in - ﬂuences the phenotype of Kif18A loss . Our ﬁndings indicate that loss of Kif18A in HAP1 cells does not cause problems in attachment of kinetochores to the mitotic spindle but neverthe - less does lead to a persistent SAC activation . In fact , we ﬁnd that the k - Mt attachments that are established in Kif18A - deﬁ - cient cells are functional enough to correctly separate sister chromatids , and therefore , HAP1 cells lacking Kif18A maintain a high ﬁdelity of chromosome segregation . This has created a unique situation in which lack of tension is observed on kinet - ochores that are attached to microtubules that appear to be fully mature and functional . The classic view is that in unperturbed conditions , the SAC senses loss of k - Mt attachments . Recently , it was shown that stabilizing k - Mt attachments with a non - phosphorylatable Hec1 mutant was sufﬁcient to satisfy the SAC under conditions 2692 Current Biology 28 , 2685 – 2696 , September 10 , 2018 of low tension [ 20 , 41 ] . Moreover , it was shown that Mps1 directly competes with microtubules for binding to Hec1 , indi - cating that microtubule attachment can directly displace an essential checkpoint component , consistent with a direct rela - tion between attachment and SAC silencing [ 42 , 43 ] . These data suggest that SAC activation depends on a lack - of - attach - ment signal for its activation and implies that a lack - of - tension signal , due to erroneous attachments , cannot be sensed directly by the SAC . This potential caveat is ﬁxed via an error - sensing mechanism that efﬁciently promotes detachment of misattached k - Mts , thus recreating an unattached kinetochore that can ( re - ) activate the SAC [ 13 , 44 ] . However , another study shows that depleting Mklp2 leads to retention of Aurora B , which in turn re - cruits different checkpoint proteins , such as Mps1 , to the micro - tubule - bound kinetochores in anaphase . In this setting , the recruitment of SAC proteins did not induce a mitotic delay ; how - ever , it does implicate that Mps1 can be recruited to microtu - bule - bound kinetochores [ 36 ] . In conclusion , many studies have conﬁrmed a tight link between tension and attachment [ 23 , 34 , 45 ] , and the general consensus is that SAC activation is due to a lack of k - Mt attachments [ 3 , 46 ] . However , despite the evidence in favor of unattached kinetochores as the primary source of SAC activation , the role of tension in SAC activation has never been fully resolved due to the intricate links between tension and attachment . Under normal circumstances , tension is needed to stabilize k - Mt attachments [ 47 ] , and besides , unat - tached kinetochores will never be under tension , making it challenging to obtain a setting where tension is normal but attachments are lacking . Several studies in budding yeast have suggested a direct role for tension in SAC activation [ 21 , 48 , 49 ] . There is only scant ev - idence for attachment - independent activation of the SAC in higher organisms . For example , PtK1 cells grown in hypothermic conditions are severely delayed in mitosis , despite the fact that their kinetochores acquire normal numbers of k - Mts [ 24 ] . These kinetochores are not under full tension , and the mitotic delay can Attachment SAC - active Tension Attachment Wild - type Kif18A loss SAC - inactive ; cell - division Mitotic arrest ; cell - death No tension Kif18A Kinetochore Mitotic spindle ( microtubules ) Kinetochore Mitotic spindle ( microtubules ) SAC Figure 6 . Loss of Kif18A Results in SAC Activation at Microtubule - Attached Kinetochores Schematic overview of hypothetical model of Kif18A loss . In WT cells , Kif18A is recruited to the plusendsofmicrotubuleswhenchromosomesare properlyalignedatthemetaphaseplate , leadingto a reduction of chromosome oscillations , stabili - zation of k - Mt attachments , and the generation of tension , which silences the SAC and promotes anaphase onset . Upon loss of Kif18A , the oscilla - tory movements of chromosomes are no longer reduced and tension defects are found at the checkpoint signaling kinetochores . Thus , the ten - sion defect is able to activate or maintain the SAC , leading to a mitotic arrest and subsequent cell death without destabilizing the k - Mt attachment . be rescued by inhibition of the SAC , indi - cating that loss of tension can directly activate the SAC under these conditions . However , there was no evidence of Mad2 recruitment to these kinetochores . Another study in PtK2 cells shows that Mad1 starts to be lost af - ter end - on microtubule attachment and before a full k - ﬁber forms . This Mad1 loss is subsequently associated with force generation , leading to tension generation [ 50 ] . These data imply a switch - like interplay between SAC activity and tension . Our current study provides a new set of data that need to be considered in this tension - versus - attachment debate . As mentioned above , tension and attachment are interlinked , mak - ing it difﬁcult to experimentally dissect the two . Here , we provide a unique setting where a tension defect is established without chemically interfering with microtubule dynamics . We ﬁnd that human HAP1 cells lacking Kif18A can establish fully functional k - Mt attachments that can facilitate proper chromosome segre - gation but that the attached kinetochores experience defects in tension . Our intensity measurements of the k - Mts could not discern any reductions in the overall thickness or intensity of the staining of the k - Mts bound to kinetochores in Kif18A - deﬁ - cient cells . However , the inter - and intra - kinetochore distance indicated a clear reduction in tension across checkpoint - signaling kinetochores , altogether suggesting that Mad1 is re - cruited to kinetochores that have functional k - Mt attachments . Of course , it is possible that minor differences in microtubule oc - cupancy at kinetochores of Kif18A - deﬁcient cells cannot be de - tected with these assays , but it should be noted that these cells are perfectly capable to drive proper chromosome segregation . Thus , this implies that either the SAC is activated by very minor defects in attachment , not detectable with our assays and not giving rise to segregation errors , or that the checkpoint is directly responsive to lack of tension , causing kinetochores to recruit Mad1 . Based on our data , we conclude that the tension defects in Kif18A - depleted cells activate the SAC ( Figure 6 ) . In contrast , a direct role for Kif18A in SAC inactivation could also explain the observed SAC - dependent arrest in Kif18A - depleted cells . However , if Kif18A would be necessary for SAC inactivation , we would not expect to see Mad1 activity at only a subset of kineto - chores , and we would not expect such a pleiotropic phenotype . Current Biology 28 , 2685 – 2696 , September 10 , 2018 2693 We hypothesize that the tension defects upon Kif18A deple - tion are linked to the hyper - oscillations of the chromosomes . Possibly , these extreme oscillations perturb the ability of the spindle microtubules to produce stable forces across sister ki - netochores , especially when the chromosomes switch from poleward to anti - poleward movements and vice versa . These se - vere ﬂuctuations in tension could then be translated into SAC activation . This hypothesis also ﬁts with the fact that we mostly observe SAC activation on the kinetochores that reside outside the metaphase plate . Another possible explanation for the ten - sion defects and hyper - oscillations observed in Kif18A - depleted cells could be that Kif18A is needed to directly stabilize the k - Mt attachment [ 51 ] . When stabilization is impossible due to Kif18A loss , tension cannot be established across sister kinetochores . This lack of k - Mt stabilization could be the underlying cause of the chromosome hyper - oscillations seen after Kif18A loss . How - ever , it needs to be noted that we observe that the loss of tension in Kif18A - depleted cells occurs at kinetochores with apparent correct k - Mt attachment . A remaining question is : if tension is lost , then why do we not see a loss of k - Mt attachments ? We envision several explana - tions for this . First , it could be that the tension defect is very tran - sient because chromosomes continuously move back and forth . This could provide insufﬁcient time for Aurora B to destabilize the attached k - Mts yet provide enough time to recruit Mad1 . Sec - ond , Kif18A has microtubule depolymerase activity , making it not unlikely that loss of Kif18A leads to hyper - stable k - Mts , leav - ing only room for SAC activation by tension defects . This tran - sient state of tension loss , followed by SAC activation could also explain the pleiotropic mitotic phenotype observed upon loss of Kif18A ; the stochasticity of SAC activation could result in a situation where there are no or an insufﬁcient number of SAC - positive kinetochores to maintain the mitotic delay . This then results in anaphase onset and would explain why not all cells remain in mitosis persistently . One other synthetic viable hit in our screen was astrin , a pro - tein that is known to bind to kinetochores upon generation of ten - sion [ 35 ] . Astrin has previously been linked to stabilization of k - Mt attachments , chromosome alignment , and SAC silencing [ 30 ] . The fact that we ﬁnd both Kif18A and astrin to be synthetic viable with Mad1 / Mad2 loss suggests that both proteins work in the same process , inﬂuencing chromosomal movements and thus tension . Indeed , astrin - depleted cells behave similar to Kif18A - depleted cells . In contrast to another study [ 30 ] , we observe astrin localization in Kif18A - depleted cells . Thus , although Kif18A does not affect the recruitment of astrin to kinet - ochores , it is likely that Kif18A and astrin work in a similar pathway to suppress chromosome oscillations . Taken together , our data show that loss of Kif18A ( or astrin ) can induce SAC activation in the presence of fully functional k - Mt attachments . This not only allowed us to gain a better un - derstanding of the function of Kif18A but also provided us with a unique setting in which tension is lacking and attachments appear to be normal . Our observations suggest that the SAC can be activated , even when microtubules are bound , disputing a model where the SAC only senses unattached kinetochores . We cannot rule out that minor attachment defects that we fail to detect are the source of the checkpoint signal , but at least our data show that a lack of tension is enough to ( re - ) activate the SAC in a situation where the attachment is good enough to ensure proper segregation of the attached chromatid . It would therefore be interesting to look for other settings where the SAC is activated when fully functional k - Mt attachments are pre - sent , but most intriguingly , it would be interesting to unravel how the lack of tension could promote Mps1 and Mad1 recruitment .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Cell Lines and Tissue Culture Human derived near - haploid HAP1 cells were cultured in IMDM ( GIBCO ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , 1 % GlutaMAX supplement ( GIBCO ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 m g / ml streptomycin . siRNA transfections were performed using RNAiMax ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufactures guidelines . The following siRNAs were used in this study : siNon - Targetable ( Dharmacon ) , siKif18A ( Dharmacon , custom : CCAACAACAGUGCCAUAAAUU ) , siAstrin ( Dharmacon OTP smartpool ) . All compounds ( Nocodazole , MG132 , Eg5 - inhibitor STLC ) were dissolved in DMSO and used at indicated concentrations . METHOD DETAILS Insertional mutagenesis screens Genes essential for ﬁtness of WT and two D MAD1 and two D MAD2 cell lines were identiﬁed as previously described [ 25 ] . In brief , gene trap retrovirus was produced in HEK293T cells , as previously described [ 55 ] . Retrovirus was harvested twice daily for a min - imum of three days , and pelleted by centrifugation ( 2 hours , 21 , 000 rpm , 4 (cid:3) C using a SW28 rotor . Approximately 40 million D MAD1 and two D MAD2 HAP1 cells were mutagenized by transduction of the concentrated gene trap virus in the presence of 8 m g / ml protamine sulfate in a T175 ﬂask for at least two consecutive days . The mutagenized cells were passaged for an additional 10 - 12 days after the last infection . After passaging , cells were collected by trypsin - EDTA followed by pelleting . Cells were ﬁxed using ﬁx buffer I ( BD biosciences ) . To minimize confounding from diploid cells potentially harboring heterozygous mutations , ﬁxed cells were stained with DAPI to allow sorting on G1 haploid DNA content using an Astrios Moﬂo . 30 million sorted cells were lysed overnight at 56 (cid:3) C to allow for de - crosslinking followed by genomic DNA isolation using a DNA mini kit ( QIAGEN ) .

Mapping and analysis of insertions sites is described in detail by Raaijmakers et al . [ 26 ] . Brieﬂy , following sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 or HiAeq 2500 ( Illumina ) , insertion sites were mapped to the human genome ( h19 ) allowing one mismatch [ 25 ] , and intersected with RefSeq coordinates to assign insertions sites to genes [ 56 ] . Gene regions overlapping on opposite strands were not considered for analysis , while for genes over - lapping on the same strand gene names were concatenated . For each replicate for both genotypes ( MAD1 and MAD2 ) gene essen - tiality was determined by binomial test . Synthetic lethality and viability was assessed by comparing the distribution of sense and anti - sense orientation integrations for each gene in the MAD1 / 2 replicates with 4 wild - type control datasets previously published [ 57 ] ( NCBI SRA accession number SRP058962 ) using Fisher’s exact tests . A gene was considered a hit when it passed all Fisher’s tests with a P value cutoff of 0 . 05 and an effect size of at least 20 % . CRISPR - mediated generation of knockout cell - lines Mad2 knockout cells were generated using CRISPR / Cas9 mediated genome editing . Guide sequences were designed using CRISPR design . Guides to generate knockout cell lines were targeted against exon 1 - 3 of the gene of interest , and subsequently cloned into the pX330 vector [ 54 ] . pX330 and a donor vector containing a blasticidine resistance - cassette [ 58 ] were co - transfected in HAP1 cells and selected with 5 m g / ml blasticidin . Double - knockouts were generated by repeating the same procedure in Mad2 knockout cells , using a donor vector containing a puromycin resistance - cassette . Individual clones were selected and knockouts were conﬁrmed using both PCR to conﬁrm integration of the blasticidin cassette at the correct locus and by western blot analysis . Guides used were : Mad2 forward caccGATTTCGGCGCTCCCGCGCA , Mad2 reverse aaacTGCGCGGGAGCGCCGAAATC , Kif18A clone A for - ward caccgAGTAGTAGTTCGTGTACGTC , Kif18A clone A reverse aaacGACGTACACGAACTACTACTc , Kif18A clone B forward caccgCTACTTTCATATGGTGGCAC , Kif18A clone B reverse aaacGTGCCACCATATGAAAGTAGc , Astrin forward caccgTGCAGGG TAAGTTCACGGAG , and Astrin reverse aaacCTCCGTGAACTTACCCTGCAc . Plasmids and cell lines The lentiviral plasmid pCW57 . 1 ( Addgene # 41393 ) was used as an all - in - one Tet responsive system . GFP - Mad2 was inserted into the pCW57 . 1 plasmid by using the Nhel and Agel restriction sites . To insert the T2A sequence between GFP and Mad2 , a synthetic block was ordered ( IDT ) and inserted using EcoRI and PSTI restriction sites . To obtain a successfully cloned plasmid , the ligation product was transformed into StBL3 bacteria using heat shock and selected on LB ampicillin plates . Sequencing of plasmids conﬁrmed suc - cessful insertion . Stable cell - lines were created by lentiviral production in HEK293T cells . For this , cloned plasmids were co - trans - fected with lentiviral packaging and viral envelope constructs . Virus was harvested 48 hours after HEK293T transfection and added into the cell culture medium of HAP1 cells to achieve stable pCW _ GFP _ T2A _ Mad2 integration into the genome . Western blot Cells were lysed using Laemmli buffer ( 120 mM Tris pH 6 . 8 , 4 % SDS , 20 % glycerol ) . Equal amounts of protein were separated on a polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane . Membranes were blocked in a 5 % Milk / TBS solution .

Softworx ( Applied Precision ) , ImageJ , Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS6 were used to process acquired images . For Mps1 stainings , cells were grown , ﬁxed , stained and imaged as described for the tubulin stainings . However , before ﬁxation , cells were pre - treated for half an hour with MG132 , followed by one hour of Mps1 inhibition using 100nM Cpd - 5 [ 52 ] . The following primary antibodies were used : rabbit anti - alpha - tubulin ( Abcam , ab18251 ) , mouse anti - Mps1 ( Millipore , NT , clone 3 - 472 - 1 ) , human anti - Crest ( Cortex Biochem , cs1058 ) . Live - Cell Microscopy Cells were plated on 8 - well glass - bottom dishes ( LabTek ) and cultured in L - 15 CO 2 independent medium ( GIBCO ) . Cells were imaged using a Deltavision deconvolution microscope ( Applied Precision ) equipped with a heat chamber . For DNA visualization , 250nM SiR - DNA ( Spirochrome ) was added 2 hours before imaging . Images were acquired every ﬁve minutes using a 20x ( 0 . 25 NA ) objective . Z stacks were acquired with 2 m m intervals . Images were analyzed and processed using Softworx ( Applied Precision ) and ImageJ . Chromosome spreads Chromosome spreads were prepared from WT HAP1 cells treated with siNT for 48 hours , D Mad2 cells , and D Mad2 D Kif18A _ A1 / B1 cells . Cells were treated with Nocodazole for 1 hour prior to harvesting through shake - off . Cells were then incubated with 0 . 075M of KCl at 37 (cid:3) C for 10 minutes . Thereafter , a drop of ﬁxative ( methanol : acidic acid , in a 3 : 1 ratio made fresh ) was added and the samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes . Supernatant was discarded and cells were ﬁxed with 1 mL of ﬁxative for 30 minutes . Fixative was then replaced by ﬁxative + Dapi ( 1 : 1000 ) . Subsequently , 15 m L of the cells suspension was dropped from 5 cm distance onto an ethanol cleaned coverslip . After the slides dried at room temperature , chromosome spreads were mounted with ProLong Gold ( Invitrogen ) . Images were acquired using a Deltavision deconvolution microscope ( Applied Precision ) with a 100x 1 . 40 NA oil objective . Softworx ( Applied Precision ) , ImageJ , Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS6 were used to process acquired images . FACS Cells were harvested with trypsin and ﬁxed in 70 % ethanol . GFP - positivity was measured on a LSR Fortessa ( BD Biosciences ) . Single cells were selected based on forward and side scatter diagrams , GFP - positive cells were identiﬁed by 488nm excited short pass ( 530 nm ) versus long pass ( 710 nm ) plots to exclude HAP1 auto - ﬂuorescence . 10 . 000 gated events were detected for each sample . Data were analyzed using FlowJo software ( LLC ) . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Signiﬁcant differences between cell - lines were calculated using a Student’s t test . The number of cells or kinetochores measured per individual experiment can be found in the corresponding ﬁgure legends . In all ﬁgures : * , p value < 0 . 05 ; * * , p value < 0 . 01 ; * * * , p value < 0 . 001 ; * * * * , p value < 0 . 0001 .
