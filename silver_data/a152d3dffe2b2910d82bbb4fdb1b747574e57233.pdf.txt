Proper partitioning of NE and ER is crucial for cellular activity , but the key factors maintaining the boundary between NE and ER remain to be elucidated . Here we show that the conserved membrane proteins Lem2 and Lnp1 cooperatively play a crucial role in maintaining the NE - ER membrane boundary in ﬁ ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Cells lacking both Lem2 and Lnp1 caused severe growth defects associated with aberrant expansion of the NE / ER membranes , abnormal leakage of nuclear proteins , and abnormal formation of vacuolar - like structures in the nucleus . Overexpression of the ER membrane protein Apq12 rescued the growth defect associated with membrane disorder caused by the loss of Lem2 and Lnp1 . Genetic analysis showed that Apq12 had overlapping functions with Lnp1 . We propose that a membrane protein network with Lem2 and Lnp1 acts as a critical factor to maintain the NE - ER boundary . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 OPEN 1 Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences , Osaka University , Suita 565 - 0871 , Japan . 2 Advanced ICT Research Institute Kobe , National Institute of Information and Communications Technology , Kobe 651 - 2492 , Japan . 3 Electron Microscope Laboratory , Keio University School of Medicine , Shinjuku - ku , Tokyo 160 - 8582 , Japan . 4 Present address : Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine , Hiroshima University , Hiroshima 734 - 8553 , Japan . ✉ email : yhira @ fbs . osaka - u . ac . jp ; hiraoka @ fbs . osaka - u . ac . jp COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 | www . nature . com / commsbio 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; T he eukaryotic genome is organized within the nucleus surrounded by the nuclear envelope ( NE ) . The NE com - prises of inner and outer nuclear membranes , which are continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membranes . Integrity of the NE is crucial for retaining the nuclear barrier and thereby maintaining cell viability 1 ; yet , the NE is dynamic , repeatedly breaking down and reforming during mitosis ( open mitosis ) in higher eukaryotic cells 2 , 3 . To seal the membrane holes during NE reformation at the end of mitosis , the endosomal sorting complex required for transport - III ( ESCRT - III ) is transiently recruited to the reforming NE by charged multivesicular body protein 7 ( CHMP7 in metazoa ; Chm7 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Cmp7 in the ﬁ ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) 4 – 8 . ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities ( AAA ) - ATPase Vps4 is loaded on the NE reforming sites and induces disassembly of ESCRT - III to complete the NE sealing 5 , 8 , 9 . Recent studies have demonstrated that Lem2 , a member of the conserved LEM - domain NE protein family , is also involved in the nuclear membrane sealing at the end of mitosis 5 – 8 , 10 , 11 by acting as a nuclear - targeting adaptor for CHMP7 5 . Unlike “ open mitosis ” in metazoan cells , fungal cells undergo “ closed mitosis , ” in which the NE remains intact throughout the process of mitosis 12 – 14 . In S . pombe , however , the spindle pole body ( SPB ) is inserted into the NE prior to mitosis and excluded from the NE at the end of mitosis and thus requires sealing of the hole of the NE 15 , 16 . All ESCRT - III components and related proteins are conserved in S . pombe 5 , suggesting that S . pombe may also be using similar mechanisms to seal the membrane hole . ESCRT - III is involved in sealing a membrane rupture not only during mitosis but also during interphase in mammalian cells , illustrating its global role in maintaining NE integrity 17 , 18 . S . pombe Lem2 , which shares LEM - like domain ( HEH / LEM domain ) with metazoan Lem2 , plays a role in the integrity of the NE and in stability of the chromosomes 5 , 19 – 25 . Defects in the cells lacking Lem2 are suppressed by an increased amount of Lnp1 24 . Lnp1 ( homolog of human Lunapark ) is an ER membrane protein conserved from yeasts to humans . Lnp1 localizes at the three - way junction of the tubular ER network in humans and S . cerevisiae and stabilizes the junction in cooperation with GTPase Sey1 ( a yeast homolog of human atlastin that mediates ER membrane fusion ) and reticulons and DP1 / Yop1p ( curvature - stabilizing proteins ) 26 – 31 . Accordingly , loss of Lem2 and Lnp1 induces severe growth defects 24 , suggesting that these proteins have a cooperative role in crucial cellular processes . However , the roles of these NE / ER membrane proteins in cellular processes and the functional relationship between these membrane proteins remain unknown . To understand the roles of the NE / ER membrane proteins in cellular processes , we observed the morphology of the intracel - lular membranes in S . pombe cells lacking these proteins using ﬂ uorescence microscopy and electron microscopy . To further understand the functional relationship between several mem - brane proteins , genetic interaction analyses were performed in combination with cytological analyses . In this report , we describe the role of Lem2 and Lnp1 in maintaining the boundary between NE and ER membranes and discuss the membrane protein net - work in S . pombe . Results Loss of Lem2 and Lnp1 disorders partitions of the NE and ER . We have previously reported that the double disruption of lem2 + and lnp1 + ( lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ ) induces severe synthetic growth defects in S . pombe , while the single disruption of each gene shows no growth defects 24 . To elucidate the functional relationship between NE and ER proteins , we examined the growth of double mutants of Lnp1 with inner nuclear membrane proteins , Lem2 ( HEH / LEM - domain protein ) , Man1 ( another HEH / LEM - domain pro - tein ) , or Bqt4 ( Lem2 - binding protein ) . We observed that , while lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ induces severe growth defects in minimum medium ( Edinburgh minimal medium with glutamate ( EMMG ) ) and rich medium ( Yeast Extract with Supplements ( YES ) ) , man1 Δ lnp1 Δ or bqt4 Δ lnp1 Δ grew normally in either medium ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . These results suggest that Lnp1 has a unique genetic interaction with Lem2 among these inner nuclear membrane proteins . We then investigated the cellular phenotypes associated with severe growth defects in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . We ﬁ rst observed the NE morphology by expressing mCherry - tagged Ish1 ( Ish1 - mCherry ) as an NE marker 32 , 33 in wild - type ( WT ) and mutant cells ( Fig . 1a ) . Remarkably , > 85 % of the lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells displayed an abnormal NE morphology , a phenotype that was rarely ( 0 . 3 – 3 . 9 % ) observed in WT , lem2 Δ , and lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Abnormal nuclear shapes deviating from the circular shape , disordered membranes extending from the nucleus ( Fig . 1a , arrows ) , and highly aggregated membrane structures near the nucleus and in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1a , arrowheads ) were observed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . We also examined localization of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) using green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion of various nucleoporins ( Nups ) , Cut11 ( one of the transmembrane Nups ) , Nup97 ( a component of the inner ring subcomplex ) , Nup62 ( a component of the central channel ) , and Nup120 ( a component of the outer ring subcomplex ) 34 . These Nups in the mutant cells , carrying double disruption of lem2 + and lnp1 + , were localized at the nuclear periphery as in WT cells ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) but did not localize to the abnormally extended membranes outside the nucleus ( Fig . 1c , arrows ) . These results suggest that the NE and ER membranes are disorganized by the double disruption of lem2 + and lnp1 + , leading to production of extra NPC - free membranes extending from the nucleus . To further examine whether the NE and ER are properly partitioned in the mutant cells , we observed the NE and ER membranes by expressing Ish1 - mCherry and GFP - ADEL ( an ER retention signal ) 35 as a marker protein , respectively ( Fig . 1d ) . Ish1 - mCherry was localized at the NE and GFP - ADEL was localized at the perinuclear and cortical ERs in WT , lem2 Δ , and lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 1d , WT , lem2 Δ , and lnp1 Δ ) , whereas in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells , Ish1 - mCherry and GFP - ADEL were localized at the NE , the deformed ER , and the highly aggregated membranes ( Fig . 1d , lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ ) ; quanti ﬁ cation of localization of Ish1 - mCherry and GFP - ADEL showed that their separate localization at perinuclear and cortical ER was lost in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In addition , Rtn1 protein , which participates in tubular ER network formation and is localized in the cortical ER 36 , was also mislocalized in the aggregated membranes but not in the perinuclear ER in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 1e , arrow ) . These results suggest that the boundary between the NE and ER membranes is lost in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . Because the double disruption mutant of lem2 + and lnp1 + , but not single disruption mutants , causes severe deformations of the NE or ER membranes , Lem2 and Lnp1 seem to have redundant functions in partitioning the NE and ER membrane compartments . Lem2 and Lnp1 are necessary for the nuclear barrier function . To examine whether the severe deformations of the NE and ER membranes in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells are associated with breakage of the nuclear barrier function , we observed localization of the nuclear proteins by expressing nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) tagged with GFP - GST ( GFP - GST - NLS ) . We assessed the nuclear barrier function by quantifying fold enrichment of the ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 | www . nature . com / commsbio GFP signal in the nucleus ( nucleus / cytoplasm ratio ) ( Fig . 2a – e ) . The GFP signal was accumulated in the nucleus in WT , lem2 Δ , and lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 2a – c ) , while it severely leaked from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( arrows in Fig . 2d ) . Leakage of the GFP signal was observed during both interphase and mitosis . The percentage of cells with leakage during mitosis was 97 % ( 143 / 147 ) in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells , while it was 0 . 46 % ( 1 / 216 ) in WT , 1 . 1 % ( 2 / 182 ) in lem2 Δ , and 3 . 0 % ( 7 / 233 ) in lnp1 Δ cells . To dissect the timing of the mitotic leakage , we co - expressed Atb2 - mCherry to visualize the mitotic spindle simultaneously with GFP - GST - NLS ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells undergoing mito - sis , leakage started immediately after mitotic spindle forma - tion , reached a maximum during chromosome segregation , and continued until mitotic spindle disassembly ( Fig . 2f ; see Fig . 2g , h for quanti ﬁ cation ) , suggesting that the mitotic leakage cor - relates with SPB insertion / extrusion . In contrast , only transient and faint leakage during chromosome segregation was observed in the WT and single mutants ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . During interphase in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells , the transient leakage of GFP - GST - NLS occasionally occurred ( time of leakage is indi - cated by red arrows in Fig . 2f , g ) .

As shown in Fig . 2h , var - iations of the fold enrichment values were larger in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells than in WT , lem2 Δ , and lnp1 Δ cells ( compare with Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , re ﬂ ecting the transient nuclear leakage that occurred at random timings in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . Because the leakage of the GFP signal was transient and the signal was able to recover in the nucleus during a relatively short period of time , it is unlikely that nuclear transport is defective in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . Taken together , these observa - tions suggest that the nuclear barrier function is lost in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 . f 0 20 40 W T l np1 Δ l e m 2 Δ l e m 2 Δ l np1 Δ F o l dd en r i c h m en t ( N u c l eu s / cy t op l a s m ) 10 30 e * * * 107 68 75 92 n = : individual trace : trace shown at the upper panels g h a WT lnp1 Δ GFP - GST - NLS Ish1 - mCherry Merge Ish1 - mCherry Merge lem2 Δ Ish1 - mCherry Merge GFP - GST - NLS b c d GFP - GST - NLS lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ Ish1 - mCherry Merge GFP - GST - NLS 0 10 20 50 - 10 - 20 - 30 ( min ) I s h1 & A t b2 - m C he rr y G F P - G S T - N L S M e r ge ( o r i g i na l ) ( h i gh b r i gh t ne ss ) 70 60 80 0 20 40 60 Time after nuclear division ( min ) 5 10 15 - 20 80 100 mitotic spindle formation F o l d en r i c h m en t ( N u c l eu s / cy t op l a s m ) 30 … : average ( n = 7 ) 0 20 40 60 Time after nuclear division ( min ) 5 10 15 - 20 80 100 F o l d en r i c h m en t ( N u c l eu s / cy t op l a s m ) ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 4 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 | www . nature . com / commsbio Lem2 and Lnp1 maintain the boundary between the NE and ER . Loss of NE and ER partitioning and nuclear barrier function implied that NE and ER membranes were largely disordered in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . To examine the membrane structures in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells that show nuclear protein leakage , we observed those cells by correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ; Fig . 3 ) . In the cells with nuclear protein leakage , abnormally developed membrane structures were observed : ( 1 ) highly aggregated membranes associated with the NE ( Fig . 3a , b ; white arrows ) , ( 2 ) nuclear membrane rupture ( Fig . 3a – c ; green arrows ) , ( 3 ) multi - layered nuclear membrane ( Fig . 3c ; purple arrows ) , ( 4 ) multi - layered membrane vesicles distinct from the nucleus ( Fig . 3b , c ; blue arrows ) , and ( 5 ) membrane invagination ( Fig . 3b – d ; yellow arrows ) . In addition , vacuole - like structures were often observed inside the nucleus ( 25 / 49 cells , Fig . 3a , c ; arrowheads ) . Serial section images of the nucleus sometimes showed a crystal - like structure penetrating the nuclear mem - branes and fused with the vacuolar structures ( Fig . 3a , d ; double arrowheads ) . Such abnormal membrane structures were not observed in WT cells ( 0 / 89 cells , Fig . 3e , f ) . These results show that the boundary between the NE and ER is lost in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells and thereby suggests that Lem2 and Lnp1 play a role in maintaining the nuclear boundary . Domains of Lem2 and Lnp1 for their cooperative functions . To understand the functional relationship between Lem2 and Lnp1 , we examined the molecular domains required for cell growth . To do this , protein fragments of Lem2 were expressed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells and the growth recovery was determined by a spot assay ( Fig . 4a ) . Lem2 fragments lacking the HEH / LEM - domain ( Δ LEM ) or the bqt4 - binding domain ( Δ 200 - 307 ) fully recovered growth to the level of the full - length Lem2 ( Fig . 4a , + Δ LEM and + Δ 200 - 307 ; compare with + Lem2 ) , indicating that these two domains are dispensable for cell viability in the absence of Lnp1 . Lem2 fragments lacking the LuC domain or the N - terminal domain ( N and LuC , respectively ) partially recovered growth ( Fig . 4a , + N and + LuC ) , whereas the fragment lacking the C - terminal domain ( NLu ) fully recovered the growth ( Fig . 4a , compare + N with + NLu ) . These results suggest that the N - terminal and luminal domains , but not the C - terminal domain , are necessary for the Lnp1 - involving Lem2 function . To further investigate the role of the luminal domain , a mutant in which the luminal region of Lem2 was substituted by that of Man1 ( Lem2N - Man1Lu - Lem2C ; Supplementary Fig . 5a ) were expressed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells and the growth recovery was determined by a spot assay . A fragment of Lem2N - Man1Lu - Lem2C fused with GFP ( Lem2N - Man1Lu - Lem2C - GFP ) was localized to the NE ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) ; however , it displayed a very weak growth recovery ( Fig . 4a , + Lem2N - Man1Lu - Lem2C ) . This result sug - gests that the luminal region of Lem2 plays an important role in cell viability in the absence of Lnp1 . Similarly , to identify functional domains in Lnp1 , we examined the growth recovery effect of different Lnp1 fragments in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 4b ) . Lnp1 lacking the N - terminal 37 amino acid residues ( Δ N ) displayed a weak growth recovery ( Fig . 4b , + Δ N ) . Since human Lunapark is myristoylated at the second glycine residue 37 , which is conserved in S . pombe Lnp1 , we examined the effect of an un - myristoylated point mutant ( Lnp1 - G2A ) . Expression of the Lnp1 - G2A fragment in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells recovered the growth defect ( Fig . 4b , + G2A ) . This result suggests that myristoylation has a minor effect on the N - terminal function of Lnp1 . A more striking effect was observed with Lnp1 fragments lacking the lunapark domain , which is a highly conserved domain from yeasts to humans . Expression of the fragments lacking lunapark domains ( Fig . 4b , + Δ 104 - 334 , + Δ 177 - 334 , and + Δ 177 - 231 ) in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells conferred negligible growth recovery . In contrast , the fragment bearing the lunapark domain ( Δ 232 - 334 ) fully recovered the growth to the level of the full - length Lnp1 ( Fig . 4b , + Δ 232 - 334 ) . These results indicate that the N - terminal and lunapark domains of Lnp1 play a crucial role in cell viability in the absence of Lem2 . We then examined the intracellular localization of these Lnp1 fragments by expressing them as a GFP fusion protein . The full - length Lnp1 was localized to both the cortical and perinuclear ER ( Fig . 4c , Lnp1 ) . The N - terminal deletion ( Δ N ) and the un - myristoylated Lnp1 - G2A ( G2A ) showed the same localization as that of the full - length Lnp1 ( Fig . 4c , Δ N and G2A ) . Lnp1 fragments lacking the lunapark domain dispersed through vacuoles as con ﬁ rmed by co - staining with vacuole membrane - staining reagent FM4 - 64 38 ( Fig . 4c , Δ 104 - 334 , Δ 177 - 334 , and Δ 177 - 231 , and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , the Lnp1 fragment bearing the lunapark domain ( Δ 232 - 334 ) recovered its localization to the cortical and perinuclear ER ( Fig . 4c ) . These results indicate that the conserved lunapark domain is crucial for proper localization of Lnp1 . Collectively , these domain analyses indicate that the luminal region of Lem2 and the cytoplasmic N - terminal and lunapark domains of Lnp1 are necessary for their genetic interaction although other factors may be involved in connecting Lem2 and Lnp1 . Apq12 compensates Lnp1 functions in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 . To further understand the molecular basis of how Lem2 and Lnp1 cooperatively participate in partitioning between NE and ER membranes , we attempted to identify genes that genetically interact with the lem2 + or lnp1 + gene . For this pur - pose , we screened a multi - copy suppressor in the lem2 Δ lnp1 - Δ N genetic background because the Lnp1 - Δ N fragment ( Δ N ) showed growth defects without changing its localization ( see Fig . 4b , c ) . Thus we expected factors that compensated functions of Lem2 and Lnp1 to localize in the NE and ER membranes . In this screening , we transformed the lem2 Δ lnp1 - Δ N cells with a plas - mid library of the S . pombe genome and obtained 223 well - grown Fig . 2 Nuclear protein leakage occurs in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . a – d The lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells showed a leaky phenotype of GFP - GST - NLS .

PCR analysis or DNA sequencing revealed that 186 suppressor colonies carried the lem2 + gene , 29 carried the lnp1 + gene , and 8 carried other genes ( see “ Methods ” ) . We determined the DNA sequences of the 8 unidenti ﬁ ed suppressors and identi ﬁ ed apq12 + in 4 suppressors , sec8 + in 1 suppressor , and vid27 + in 2 sup - pressors as a responsible gene for suppression . These three genes rescued the growth defect of lem2 Δ lnp1 - Δ N cells to varying extents ( Fig . 5a ) . Among them , apq12 + encoding an ER mem - brane protein Apq12 almost fully rescued the growth defect to the level comparable with that of lem2 + and lnp1 + . The rescue by apq12 + overexpression on a multi - copy plasmid was also observed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) , strongly suggesting that Apq12 can compensate for the function of either Lem2 or Lnp1 . We next examined whether Apq12 rescued the NE and ER membrane defects . Expression of Apq12 under the constitutive adh1 or adh11 promoter on the chromosome rescued the growth to a level similar to that of the multi - copy plasmid ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 8 ) .

Under these conditions , expression of Apq12 rescued the NE and ER membrane defects during interphase , that is , abnormal NE shape ( Fig . 5b , c ) and nuclear protein leakage ( Fig . 5d , e ) . However , the defect in nuclear protein leakage during mitosis was not restored ( arrows in Fig . 5d ; Supplementary Fig . 9 , and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . To reveal the genetic relationship among Apq12 , Lem2 , and Lnp1 , we constructed double deletion mutants of the lem2 + , lnp1 + , and apq12 + genes and examined the growth and the NE morphology of these mutant cells ( Fig . 5f – h ) . No growth defects were observed in cells of the single deletion of apq12 + ( apq12 Δ ) , as in lem2 Δ and lnp1 Δ ( Fig . 5f ) . Growth defects and abnormal NE shape were observed in lem2 Δ apq12 Δ similar to lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ but not in lnp1 Δ apq12 Δ ( Fig . 5f – h ) . These results suggest that Apq12 has an overlapping function with Lnp1 , both of which are necessary in the absence of Lem2 , and that the overlapping functions of Lnp1 and Apq12 are redundant with Lem2 lunapark domain transmembranedomain ( TM ) HEH / LEM domain transmembranedomain ( TM ) MSC domain a c Δ104 - 334 Δ177 - 334 Lnp1 Δ232 - 334 ΔN Δ177 - 231 G2A + vector + Lem2 + N + ΔLEM + Δ200 - 307 + LuC + Lem2N - Man1Lu - Lem2C WT + NLu 316338 563583 704 Lem2N Man1Lu Lem2C 199 308 345 1144 316338 548567 688 308 688 10 45 574 EMMG l e m 2 Δ l np1 Δ 41 6378100 177 231 334 1 38 334 231 1 176 1 103 1 + vector + Lnp1 + ΔN + G2A + Δ104 - 334 + Δ177 - 334 + Δ232 - 334 b WT EMMG l e m 2 Δ l np1 Δ + Δ177 - 231 176 231 Fig . 4 Functional domains of Lem2 and Lnp1 . a Lem2 fragments indicated on the left were expressed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells .

Vps4 is mislocalized in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 . Over - expression of Apq12 recovered the NE – ER boundary in the lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ genetic background as described above . Considering that APQ12 genetically interacts with CHM7 , which encodes an ESCRT - III component in S . cerevisiae 4 , 11 , 39 , the ESCRT - III complex may be involved in maintenance of the Lem2 - Lnp1 - dependent NE - ER boundary . To test this hypothesis , we exam - ined whether overexpression of ESCRT - III - related vps4 + and cmp7 + genes could rescue the phenotypes of lem2 Δ lnp1 - Δ N cells . Since BRR6 has been identi ﬁ ed as a genetic interactor of APQ12 in S . cerevisiae 40 , 41 , we also tested the overexpression of brr6 + in lem2 Δ lnp1 - Δ N cells . Our results showed that overexpression of vps4 + , but not cmp7 + or brr6 + , partially restored the growth defect in lem2 Δ lnp1 - Δ N cells ( Fig . 6a ) . We con ﬁ rmed that overexpression of vps4 + also restored the growth of lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . We also tested whether over - expression of these genes had any effects on cell growth and found no effects on the growth of WT and lem2 Δ cells ( Supple - mentary Fig . 7b ) . These results suggest that higher levels ofVps4 is necessary to restore the growth in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 . As a possible cause for this , we speculated that functional endogenous Vps4 may be reduced in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 . To test this possibility , we expressed Vps4 tagged with mCherry ( Vps4 - mCherry ) in WT and mutant cells and examined their protein levels ( Fig . 6b ) . First , we con ﬁ rmed that Vps4 - mCherry was functional by performing the following experi - ments : ( 1 ) substitution of endogenous Vps4 with Vps4 - mCherry rescued the growth defect of vps 4 Δ cells ; ( 2 ) overexpression of Vps4 - mCherry rescued the growth defect of lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 6b ; Supplementary Fig . 7c ) .

COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 | www . nature . com / commsbio 9 compared protein levels of WT with those of mutant cells by western blotting . Results obtained showed that the protein level of Vps4 decreased in lem2 Δ and lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells compared with that in WT and lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 6b ) , suggesting that Lem2 affected the stability of Vps4 . We next examined the intracellular localization of Vps4 - mCherry in these strains . In WT cells , the ﬂ uorescence signal of Vps4 - mCherry was localized at the cytoplasmic dots ( Fig . 6 ) , and this localization overlapped with the localization of ESCRT - III components , Did2 , Did4 , Vps24 , Vps32 , and Vps60 ( S . pombe homologs of CHMP1 – CHMP5 , respectively ; Supplementary Fig . 10a ) , except for Cmp7 ; Cmp7 - GFP formed cytoplasmic dots distinct from the Vps4 dots ( Fig . 6c ) . Bright dots of Vps4 - mCherry were localized adjacent to the FM4 - 64 - positive vacuolar membranes ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) , suggesting that some fractions of Vps4 are associated with endosomes , as described previously 42 , 43 . In lnp1 Δ cells , Vps4 - mCherry and Cmp7 - GFP showed the cytoplasmic dots distinct from each other ( Fig . 6e ) , same as in WT cells . In lem2 Δ cells , Vps4 - mCherry remained at the cytoplasmic dots , whereas Cmp7 - GFP lost the dotted localization and diffused to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6d ) , suggesting that Lem2 may affect Cmp7 - dependent ESCRT - III functions . In lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells , both Vps4 - mCherry and Cmp7 - GFP lost their dotted localization and were diffused to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6f ) . Accordingly , the number of Vps4 dots remained unchanged in WT , lem2 Δ , and lnp1 Δ cells but signi ﬁ cantly decreased in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 6g ) . The number of Cmp7 dots signi ﬁ cantly decreased in lem2 Δ and lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 6h ) . Other ESCRT - III components ( Did2 , Did4 , Vps24 , Vps32 , and Vps60 ) remained at the cytoplasmic dots in lem2 Δ , lnp1 Δ , and lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . These results suggest that Lem2 and Lnp1 are necessary for the localization of Vps4 at the endosome . Taken together , Lem2 and Lnp1 synergistically affect the stability and localization of Vps4 . It has been previously reported that depletion of Vps4 induces a strong deformation in the membrane phenotype and growth defect , and these phenotypes are rescued by disruption of the cmp7 + gene 5 . Because vps4 Δ cells exhibit phenotypes similar to those observed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells , we speculated that disruption of the cmp7 + gene may bypass the phenotypes observed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells by analogy with vps4 Δ cells . To test this possibility , we disrupted the cmp7 + gene with lem2 + and lnp1 + . However , cmp7 + gene disruption did not rescue the growth defect or the disordered membrane phenotype in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Supplementary Fig . 12 , lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cmp7 Δ ) . Next , we tested whether the nuclear barrier function was defective in cmp7 Δ cells . For this purpose , we observed nuclear localization of GFP - GST - NLS during the cell cycle ( Supplementary Fig . 13 and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Results showed that no obvious nuclear protein leakage was observed in cmp7 Δ cells throughout the cell cycle , unlike in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ; compare with Fig . 2h ) , although a slight leakage was observed at the end of mitosis ( see 20 min after the nuclear division in Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Thus it is unlikely that the nuclear protein leakage in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells results from the dysfunction of Cmp7 . Taken together , these results indicate that Cmp7 did not bypass the functions of Lem2 and Lnp1 . Vps4 localization at the SPB during mitosis . We next examined localization of Vps4 during mitosis because Vps4 , together with Cmp7 , is predicted to participate in repairing the NE hole at the site where the SPB is inserted and extruded . We observed GFP - tagged Vps4 co - expressed with an SPB marker S ﬁ 1 tagged with mCherry and found that Vps4 - GFP was localized to the SPB during mitosis in WT and lnp1 Δ ( Fig . 7a , WT and lnp1 Δ ) . However , the SPB localization of Vps4 - GFP was lost in lem2 Δ and lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 7a , lem2 Δ and lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ ) , sug - gesting that localization of Vps4 at the SPB during mitosis depends on Lem2 . Cmp7 - GFP showed similar results to Vps4 during mitosis in these mutants ( Fig . 7b ) . Considering that the localization of Vps4 was independent of Lem2 during interphase ( see Fig . 6c – f ) , this result suggests that the mitotic localization of Vps4 is regulated differently from that of the interphase . Apq12 recovers Vps4 localization in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 . Because our results suggested that Apq12 has overlapping functions with Lnp1 , we examined the effect of Apq12 over - expression on Vps4 localization . As shown in the previous sec - tion , dotted localization of Vps4 - mCherry found in WT was lost in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 6f ) . Interestingly , overexpression of Apq12 in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells restored the dotted localization of Vps4 ( Fig . 8a ) ; the number of Vps4 dots that had decreased in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells was also recovered ( Fig . 8b ) . Western blotting showed that overexpression of Apq12 restored the protein levels of Vps4 , which was decreased in lem2 Δ and lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells to a comparable level of WT cells ( Fig . 8d ) . Thus Apq12 is likely to stabilize Vps4 and maintain its proper localization during inter - phase . In contrast , during mitosis , Apq12 overexpression did not restore the SPB localization of Vps4 in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells ( Fig . 8e ) . We also tested the effect of Apq12 overexpression on Cmp7 and found no effects on its localization and protein levels ( Fig . 8a , c , d ) . These results suggest that Apq12 has overlapping functions with Lnp1 in Vps4 localization and stability . Genetic interaction of the NE / ER membrane proteins . Our ﬁ ndings suggest that genetic interaction of membrane proteins maintains the membrane boundary between NE and ER , as depicted in Fig . 8f . Lem2 and Lnp1 have a redundant function required for proper Vps4 localization . Apq12 has an overlapping function with Lnp1 . Because Vps4 is necessary for membrane remodeling 44 , 45 , Lem2 and Lnp1 / Apq12 cooperatively maintain the membrane boundary between NE and ER by remodeling membranes through the functions of Vps4 and the ESCRT - III complex independently of Cmp7 . Discussion In this report , we have demonstrated that the membrane boundary between the NE and ER is severely affected in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 . In lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells , various types of membrane defects , such as highly aggregated membrane con - tinuous with the outer nuclear membrane , nuclear membrane invagination , and vacuole - like structure inside the nucleus , were observed ( Fig . 3 ) , strongly suggesting a role for Lem2 and Lnp1 in maintaining the boundary for proper partitioning of the NE and ER membrane compartments . This is consistent with a recent report which demonstrates that Lem2 and Lnp1 buffer the membrane ﬂ ow into and out of the NE 46 . The phenotypes observed in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells are remarkably similar to those in vps4 Δ cells . The deletion of vps4 + gene causes a severely disordered nuclear membrane phenotype and strong growth defect in S . pombe 5 . It has also been reported that ESCRT - III ﬁ lament and Vps4 cooperatively remodel the membrane and induce membrane scission by using ATPase activity of Vps4 44 , 45 . Our ﬁ ndings ( Fig . 6a , e and Supplementary Fig . 11 ) consistently indicate that Lem2 and Lnp1 cooperatively regulate Vps4 locali - zation . Thus it is likely that Vps4 dysfunctions in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells , and consequently lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells exhibit phenotypes similar to vps4 Δ cells , that is , abnormal membrane and growth defect . In light of a previous report showing that Lem2 and Lnp1 act as a barrier to membrane ﬂ ow and contribute to the control of ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 10 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 | www . nature . com / commsbio nuclear size 46 , we speculate that membranes to be transported between organellar compartments including NE and ER are not cropped from organelles because of dysfunction of Vps4 in lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells . It has been reported that ESCRT - III compo - nents have a Vps4 - binding motif necessary to recruit Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex 47 – 49 . However , our ﬁ ndings ( Fig . 6g ) showed that localization of Vps4 on endosomes was signi ﬁ cantly decreased in the absence of Lem2 and Lnp1 , even in the presence of ESCRT - III complex bearing the functional Vps4 - binding motif . This implies that Lem2 and Lnp1 may provide a structural scaffold that ensures interaction of Vps4 with the ESCRT - III complex . Based on this idea , we propose that Lem2 and Lnp1 cooperatively maintain the NE – ER boundary by regulating the recruitment of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex . Cmp7 - dependent NE membrane sealing by ESCRT - III at the end of mitosis has been reported in S . cerevisiae , Schizosacchar - omyces japonicus , S . pombe , and human cells 5 , 11 , 18 , 43 as well as in interphase 17 , 18 . Cmp7 is recruited to the reforming NE by Lem2 to form the ESCRT - III complex , and then Vps4 dissociates the ESCRT - III complex to complete the NE sealing 5 , 6 , 8 . In this study , we found that Lem2 was required for the localization of both Cmp7 and Vps4 at the mitotic SPB , only where NE sealing occurs in S . pombe ( Fig . 7 ) . Our ﬁ ndings are consistent with the previous ﬁ ndings described above . However , Cmp7 may not be a critical factor for sealing the interphase NE breakage that occurs in S . pombe lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells because deletion of the cmp7 + gene caused no nuclear protein leakage or growth defects during interphase ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ; also Gu et al . 5 ) . Thus it is likely that NE sealing associated with SPB extrusion during mitosis is Cmp7 dependent , but the NE – ER boundary during interphase is regulated independently of Cmp7 in S . pombe . It is reported that Lem2 and Chm7 play a role in NPC sur - veillance in S . cerevisiae 50 . However , Lem2 does not seem to play a role in S . pombe . Instead , S . pombe Lem2 play a role in the control of lipid metabolism and traf ﬁ cking . All suppressors of lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ identi ﬁ ed in this study ( Apq12 , Sec8 , and Vid27 ) have a function related to lipid metabolism . Apq12 participates in neutral lipid biosynthesis , especially for steryl esters and triacylglycerols 40 , 41 , 51 Sec8 and Vid27 are involved in membrane vesicle traf ﬁ cking in many biological processes as a component of exocyst complex and vacuolar import and degradation family , respectively 52 – 54 . In addition , our recent study has demonstrated that the synthetic lethality of lem2 Δ bqt4 Δ is rescued by over - expression of very - long - chain fatty acid elongase Elo2 23 . There - fore , Lem2 seems to play an important role in regulating membrane composition and / or structure . This study sheds light on the involvement of a membrane protein network in the maintenance of the nuclear membrane barrier . Methods S . pombe strains and culture media .

The strains including lem2 Δ were maintained in EMMG medium as previously reported 23 , 24 , 56 . For selection , 100 μ g / ml G418 disulfate ( Nacalai Tes - que , Kyoto , Japan ) , 200 μ g / ml hygromycin B ( FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp . , Osaka , Japan ) , 100 μ g / ml nourseothricin sulfate ( WERNER BioAgents , Jena , Germany ) , and 100 μ g / ml blastcidin S ( FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp . ) were added to the media , respectively . Gene disruption , integration , and tagging . Gene disruption , integration , and tagging were performed using the direct chromosome integration method , as previously described 57 , 58 . Brie ﬂ y , ~ 500bp upstream and downstream genomic regions from open reading frames ( ORFs ) of interest were ampli ﬁ ed as the homologous recombination sites for both the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends by PCR using KOD plus neo or KOD One ( TaKaRa Bio Inc . , Kusatsu , Japan ) . These PCR products are used as primers to amplify a cassette for disruption , integration , and tagging , including selection markers . The cassette was transformed to S . pombe , and the transformants were selected on an appropriate selection plate . The correct dis - ruptions , integrations , and tagging were con ﬁ rmed by genomic PCR using KOD Fx neo ( TaKaRa Bio Inc . ) from both the 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends . Plasmid construction . All plasmids used in this study were constructed using the NEBulider system ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , USA ) according to the manu - facturer ’ s protocol . Restriction enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa Bio Inc . ( Kusatsu , Japan ) and New England Biolabs ( Ipswich , USA ) . DNA sequences coding Lem2 fragments were ampli ﬁ ed by PCR from the genome and cloned into authentic lem2 promoter - harboring pCST3 - FLAGHA into Bam HI and Bgl II sites 56 . DNA sequences coding Lnp1 including the promoter ( ~ 700bp upstream from the start ATG codon ) , the protein - coding region , and the terminator ( ~ 1000 bp downstream from the stop codon ) were ampli ﬁ ed by PCR using the cDNA library pTN - FC9 as a template ( obtained from the National BioResource Project Yeast in Japan ) , respectively , and then cloned into pYC36 59 at the Bam HI site . Spot assay . S . pombe cells were cultured overnight in EMMG medium at 30°C to attain the logarithmic growth phase . Fivefold serially diluted cells were spotted on EMMG plates ( initial cell numbers spotted are 4 . 0× 10 3 cells ) and cultured at 30 °C for 2 – 4 days . Multi - copy suppressor screening . S . pombe genomic library , pTN - L1 , was pro - vided by the National BioResource Project Yeast in Japan . H1N532 cells ( h - leu1 - 32 lem2 Δ : : kan r lnp1 Δ : : hph lys1 + : : lnp1 - Δ N ) of 8 . 0× 10 7 were transformed with 6 . 5 μ g of the genomic library , plated on EMMG , and then incubated at 30°C for 4 – 5 days . Approximately 60 , 000 transformants were screened on EMMG plates .

ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 12 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 276 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 0999 - 9 | www . nature . com / commsbio determined the genomic region inside the plasmids from the remaining 8 sup - pressors by sequencing . Because most of the plasmids contained multiple genes , the genomic region of a single gene including ORFs , 5 ′ and 3 ′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ) , and ~ 1 . 0 kb upstream and downstream sequences from the UTR were ampli ﬁ ed again by PCR and inserted into the pAL - SK vector ( obtained from the National BioResource Project Yeast in Japan ) at the Bam HI site . The plasmids were then introduced into the H1N532 cells to identify the gene responsible for rescuing growth . Microscopic observation . S . pombe cells were observed using the DeltaVision Elite system ( GE Healthcare Inc . , Chicago , USA ) equipped with cool SNAP HQ 2 ( Photometrics , Tucson , USA ) or pco . edge 4 . 2 sCMOS ( PCO , Kelheim , Germany ) , ×60 PlanApo N OSC oil - immersion objective lens ( numerical aperture [ NA ] = 1 . 4 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) or the DeltaVision OMX ( GE Healthcare Inc . ) equipped with Cascade II ( Photometrics ) and ×100 UPlanSApo silicone - immersion objective lens ( NA = 1 . 35 , Olympus ) . Intracellular localization of GFP - S65T ( designated GFP throughout this study ) , mRFP , and mCherry fusion proteins was observed in living cells . For live cell imaging , cells were cultured overnight in EMMG medium at 30°C to attain the logarithmic growth phase before placing them onto the glass - bottom dish . The cells were attached to the glass via soybean lectin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) and covered with EMMG medium . Chromatic aberration except time - lapse observation for multi - color images was corrected using the Chro - magnon software ( v0 . 70 ) using a bleed - through ﬂ uorescence image as a refer - ence 61 . Optical section images were presented after deconvolution using the built - in SoftWoRx software unless otherwise noted . Denoising by the ND - sa ﬁ r pro - gram 62 was performed before deconvolution when necessary . The brightness of the images was changed using the Adobe Photoshop CS6 software for better visuali - zation , without changing the gamma settings . CLEM imaging . CLEM imaging was performed as described previously 63 , 64 . Brie ﬂ y , lem2 Δ lnp1 Δ cells were cultured overnight in EMMG medium . Cells were attached onto a dish with a gridded coverslip ( ibidi , Martinsried , Germany ) as described above and ﬁ xed by replacing the medium with a ﬁ xative ( 2 % glutar - aldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 ) . During ﬁ xation , the cells were observed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( DeltaVision system ) and then further ﬁ xed with fresh ﬁ xative at 4 °C for 2h . After washing with buffer , the cells were post ﬁ xed in 1 . 2 % KMnO 4 overnight , dehydrated , and embedded in epoxy resin . Serial sec - tions of 80 - nm thickness were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and analyzed using a transmission electron microscope ( JEM1400Plus , JEOL , Japan ) at 80 kV . Western blotting . Cells cultured in an appropriate minimum medium as descri - bed above were harvested at mid - log phase by centrifugation . The cells were lysed in 1 . 85N NaOH for 15 min on ice . Proteins were precipitated by adding 27 . 5 % trichloroacetic acid . After washing the precipitated proteins with ice - cold acetone twice , the proteins were resolved in 2× Laemmli sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer without dye . Protein concentration was quanti ﬁ ed by bicinchoninic acid assay ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Waltham , MA , USA ; cat . # 23225 ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . The same amount of total protein was subjected to SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene di ﬂ uoride membrane . The ﬂ uorescent proteins were probed with anti - GFP monoclonal ( JL8 , 1 : 2000 dilution ; TaKaRa Bio Inc . ) and anti - RFP polyclonal ( PM005 , 1 : 5000 dilution ; MBL , Nagoya , Japan ) antibodies , respectively , and detected using chemiluminescence ( ImmunoStar LD , FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp . ) . The membrane was stained with amidoblack to determine the amount of loaded protein . Statistics and reproducibility . For the quanti ﬁ cation of ﬂ uorescent signals , nuclear and cytoplasmic regions in the original unprocessed image were manually marked as regions of interest ( ROIs ) using the Fiji software 65 . After subtraction of the background noise , measured outside the cells , the mean ﬂ uorescent intensities of the ROIs were measured . Fold enrichment ( mean intensity ratio of nucleus / cytoplasm ) was calculated for each cell and plotted as a box chart . Signi ﬁ cance was assessed by Steel – Dwass test for non - parametric multiple comparison by Microsoft Excel . The number of cells examined are shown in ﬁ gure legends . For phenotype quanti ﬁ cation , images were collected from at least three independent experiments . Percentages of the phenotype were calculated in each experiment ( total number of cells examined were > 500 ) , and the values are represented as mean with standard deviation . Signi ﬁ cance was assessed by Tukey ’ s test or unpaired two - tailed Student ’ s t test using Microsoft Excel . Reporting summary .
