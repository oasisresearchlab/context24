Of these , current research is focused majorly on the etiological agent of the COVID - 19 pandemic , SARS - CoV - 2 . Understanding the host response and metabolic changes during viral infection may provide better therapeutic targets for the proper management of pathophysiological conditions associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection . We have achieved control over most emerging viral diseases ; however , a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular events prevents us from exploring novel therapeutic targets , leaving us forced to witness re - emerging viral infections . SARS - CoV - 2 infection is usually accompanied by oxidative stress , which leads to an overactive immune response , the release of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines , increasing lipid production , and also alterations in the endothelial and mitochondrial functions . PI3K / Akt signaling pathway confers protection against oxidative injury by various cell survival mechanisms including Nrf2 - ARE mediated antioxidant transcriptional response . SARS - CoV - 2 is also reported to hijack this pathway for its survival within host and few studies have suggested the role of antioxidants in modulating the Nrf2 pathway to manage disease severity . This review highlights the interrelated pathophysiological conditions associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection and the host survival mechanisms mediated by PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 signaling pathways that can help ameliorate the severity of the disease and provide effective antiviral targets against SARS - CoV - 2 .

Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Review PUBLISHED 01 June 2023 DOI 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2023 . 1158133 can cause mild to severe respiratory and gastrointestinal complications in humans ( Capron , 1987 ) . Historically these viruses were linked to the human CoVs ( 229E and OC43 ) that caused mild upper respiratory tract diseases . The emergence and re - emergence of Coronavirus diseases in the twenty - ﬁ rst century has sparked public concern since 2002 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) ( Ksiazek et al . , 2003 ) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) outbreaks ( Zaki et al . , 2012 ; Cui et al . , 2019 ) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is a highly transmissible novel virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae ( betacoronavirus 2B lineage ) , together with SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV viruses that caused previous outbreaks . SARS - CoV - 2 is the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) epidemic that emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan , China . On 11 March 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared COVID - 19 a pandemic with a high transmission rate , mortality , and morbidity ( Team , 2020 ) . Although a great deal of research has been conducted regarding viral emergence and transmission , there is very little available information explaining the pathophysiology and viable therapeutic options . In majority of cases , the infected patients do not require any special medical intervention , however in about 20 % of the COVID - 19 cases , patients do necessitate hospitalizations ( Wu and McGoogan , 2020 ) . Most of the hospitalizations are accounted to hyperin ﬂ ammation damaging organs and endothelium of blood vessels , thrombosis and immunosuppression with a possible role in latent long COVID or post - COVID conditions ( Ackermann et al . , 2021 ; Zhu et al . , 2022 ) . Several reports in the past have already documented that oxidative stress and in ﬂ ammation mutually reinforce each other and the same have also been observed in COVID - 19 patients ( Jensen et al . , 2021 ) . Although elevated levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) have detrimental consequences on cell viability and many viruses have still evolved to induce oxidative stress for their own bene ﬁ t of replication inside cells ( Lee , 2018 ) . Another important event associated with viral infection is the host lipid metabolism that plays vital role in oxidative stress , in ﬂ ammatory response and thrombotic complications associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Casari et al . , 2021 ) . Lipids also form the structural foundations of viral and cellular membranes and thus during viral infection , viruses hijack host cellular signaling and lipid biogenesis to produce lipids and other metabolites in favour of the virus life cycle . Lipidomic approaches may provide valuable insights into the host response to COVID - 19 and studies highlighting such roles may provide potential therapeutic targets ( Abu - Farha et al . , 2020 ) . The virus - host harmonious balance is the key to the survival of these viruses . Since many of the antiviral signaling pathways are initiated due to infection induced oxidative stress , it is imperative to understand the mechanistic details of how host cells maintain the redox balance . A clear understanding will allow to effectively modulate the antiviral targets . To date , there is no speci ﬁ c treatment strategy for curing COVID - 19 , however , new research and developments have paved pathways to select potent antiviral agents that can be used effectively as therapeutics against COVID - 19 . From the previous ﬁ ndings , it can be deduced that one of the best and most ef ﬁ cient cellular targets for the management of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and pathogenicity could be the PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 signaling pathways . PI3K ( phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ) is a family of enzymes that are involved in cell survival and intracellular traf ﬁ cking . Nrf2 ( nuclear factor erythroid 2 – related factor 2 ) is a key transcription factor that acts as a sensor of oxidative stress and an important regulator of antioxidant defense mechanism via modulating the transcription of more than 200 cytoprotective genes ( Tebay et al . , 2015 ) . Previous studies have shown that multiple viruses including Herpes simplex virus , Porcine circovirus , In ﬂ uenza A viruses , vaccinia and cowpox viruses utilize the PI3K / Akt signalling pathways for replication and establising successful infection ( Ehrhardt et al . , 2007 ; Soares et al . , 2009 ; Wei et al . , 2012 ; Eaton et al . , 2014 ) . Studies have also reported that the PI3K pathway is activily involved in the endocytic uptake of in ﬂ uenza viruses ( Ayllon et al . , 2012 ) and ebola viruses ( Saeed et al . , 2008 ) thus demonstrating the extent of involvement of signalling pathways in viral infections . PI3K / Akt pathway has been shown to play a critical role in regulating SARS - CoV - 2 entry ( Shou et al . , 2020 ) and evidence from other studies further suggest that the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway also inhibits NF - κ B and subsequently reduces the expression of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines ( Li et al . , 2021 ) . Nrf2 and NF - κ B has also been known to transcriptionally co - regulate the response of cells to oxidative stress and in ﬂ ammation via the PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 signaling pathway ( Lekshmi et al . , 2019 ) , thus making it a crucial target to develop host directed antiviral strategies against SARS - CoV2 and other related viruses . A comprehensive analysis of all data suggests that PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 signaling could be a powerful tool to manage SARS - CoV - 2 infection via antioxidant , anti - in ﬂ ammatory , and lipid metabolism regulation . In this review , possible cellular targets and molecular mechanisms involved in SARS - CoV - 2 infection , as well as therapeutic approaches to treat its pathophysiological complications , are discussed with special emphasis on PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 pathway . Viruses hijack PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 pathway for survival Several viruses exploit the host metabolic pathways in order to meet their needs of survival . The phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinases ( PI3K ) - Akt pathway is one such signaling event that is central to metabolism and other cellular functions as well as a common target of many viruses ( Cooray , 2004 ; Buchkovich et al . , 2008 ; Diehl and Schaal , 2013 ) . Although the PI3Ks belong to a large family of lipid kinases belonging to 3 classes : class 1 ( 1A and 1B ) , class II , and class III ; the PI3K - Akt pathway falls within the class 1A PI3Ks . The class 1A PI3Ks get activated directly or indirectly via small GTPase RAS . The PI3K activation further phosphorylates and activates its most prominent effector Akt which then localizes to the plasma membrane . Viruses have evolved to utilize this pathway for successful entry into target cells or traf ﬁ cking through the cytoplasm ( Saeed et al . , 2008 ; Feng et al . , 2011 ; Fujioka et al . , 2011 ; Izmailyan et al . , 2012 ) . Nrf2 , nuclear factor ( erythroid - derived 2 ) - like 2 , is a cytoprotective transcription factor belonging to the cap´n´collar basic leucine zipper family that binds to antioxidant response element ( ARE ) for regulating the transcription of genes encoding proteins which maintain cellular redox homeostasis and metabolic balance ( Cuadrado et al . , 2019 ) . Under normal conditions , Nrf2 is maintained in an inactive state in the cytosol by binding with KEAP Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin . org 02 Lekshmi et al . 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2023 . 1158133 1 ( Kelch - like ECH - associated protein 1 ) , an adaptor subunit of Cullin 3 - based E3 ubiquitin ligase which acts as a sensor of oxidative stress . ROS , by modifying the speci ﬁ c cysteine residues , inactivates KEAP1 and thereby releases Nrf2 into the nucleus to induce transcription of Nrf2 - responsive genes by binding with ARE . This in turn activates ARE - dependent gene expression of a series of cytoprotective and antioxidative proteins including heme oxygenase - 1 ( HO - 1 ) , glutathione peroxidase 1 , glutathionine S - transferase ( GST ) , glutathione reductase ( GR ) , and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , NAD ( P ) H dehydrogenase , quinone 1 ( NQO1 ) and c - glutamylcysteine synthetase ( Sun et al . , 2021a ) . The pathophysiology of respiratory viral infections generally involves a redox imbalance or oxidative stress that is associated with the release of cytokines , in ﬂ ammation and cell death . Studies have shown crucial roles of overproduction of ROS in virus replication and virus - associated diseases ( Gu and Korteweg , 2007 ) . Since excessive oxidative stress can be detrimental to the host cells , several viruses maintain an optimal level of oxidative stress , enough to support its replication without killing cells , by manipulating the Nrf2 pathway . When ROS are released upon viral infection , the host cells activate an antioxidative defense mechanism , in which the Nrf2 pathway acts as a ﬁ rst line of defense for cytoprotection and detoxi ﬁ cation . Virus - induced modulation of the host antioxidative response have been reported to be an important factor in the progression of several viral diseases . Recently several studies have also reported that groups of clinically relevant viruses can regulate the Nrf2 pathway in both positive and negative manner ( Lee , 2018 ) . Human immunode ﬁ ciency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) , the etiological agent of acquired immunode ﬁ ciency syndrome ( AIDS ) is also linked with the development of neurocognitive disorders . The viral protein , gp120 is known for its causative role in the HIV - 1 - associated neurodegeneration through induction of oxidative stress . Based on studies conducted in HIV infected astrocytes , the use of Nrf2 activators was suggested as a promising approach to enhance lung innate immunity in HIV patients ( Reddy et al . , 2012 ) . In 2012 , Zhang et al . , demonstrated that a major catechin from tea , Epigallocatechin - 3 - O - gallate ( EGCG ) , was able to improve the cellular alterations induced by oxidative stress associated with Tat - induced HIV - 1 transactivation by regulating nuclear levels of Nrf2 and NF - κ B . The ﬁ ndings make the Nrf2 pathway the prime therapeautic target ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) , responsible for chronic hepatitis , exerts differential effects on the Nrf2 pathway depending on the cellular context and level of oxidative stress . Numerous HCV proteins , including the core , NS3 , and NS5A , cause hepatocellular damage as a result of oxidative stress . The production of ROS during HCV infection promotes the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 , which activates target genes such as HO - 1 and glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit ( γ GCSH ) ( Carvajal - Yepes et al . , 2011 ; Ivanov et al . , 2011 ) . Numerous cellular kinases have been implicated in the phosphorylation and activation of Nrf2 , including PI3K - Akt , JNK , ERK1 / 2 , p38 MAPKs , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) . In light of these ﬁ ndings , activation of Nrf2 pathway was suggested as one possible mechanism for HCV - infected cells to survive ( Carvajal - Yepes et al . , 2011 ; Ivanov et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , in ﬂ uenza viruses induce infection mainly through oxidative stress and respiratory in ﬂ ammation . In addition , in ﬂ uenza viruses have also been shown to stimulate apoptosis and cytotoxicity in alveolar epithelial cells , as demonstrated by an increase in caspase 1 , caspase 3 , and the proin ﬂ ammatory cytokine IL - 8 via activation of Nrf2 pathway by facilitating nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and subsequent expression of Nrf2 - target genes such as HO - 1 ( Kosmider et al . , 2012 ) . The suppression of Nrf2 gene was also found to enhance the replication of in ﬂ uenza virus which was reversed by the pharmacological induction of Nrf2 via EGCG supplementation ( Kesic et al . , 2011 ) . In a proteomic analysis performed by Simon and colleagues , Nrf2 was found to be negatively affected by in ﬂ uenza virus infection . Thus , like HCV infection , in ﬂ uenza virus infection has also been found to induce differential antioxidative responses depending on cellular context ( Simon et al . , 2015 ) . Likewise , positive or negative regulation of Nrf2 via PI3K / Akt or other signaling pathways through pharmacological modulators have shown to regulate the infection of various viruses including RSV , HCV , HBV , Herpes , DENV and Zika virus ( Cho et al . , 2009 ; Zhu et al . , 2010 ; Schachtele et al . , 2012 ; Huang et al . , 2017 ) . The respiratory syndrome caused by SARS - CoV - 2 continues to be a major healthcare concern around the globe because of no speci ﬁ c treatment availability for COVID - 19 . Since the treatments for COVID - 19 are known to suppress the symptoms , modulating signaling pathways via therapeutic targets could be important for managing the disease severity . The PI3K / Akt signaling pathway has been identi ﬁ ed as a novel therapeutic target against SARS - COV - 2 infection due to its involvement in virus entry and host immune response . ACE2 and CD147 are known to be the prime entry receptors for SARS - COV - 2 ( Hoffmann et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . The reduced cell surface expression of ACE2 during infection results in angiotensin 2 accumulation , which upon binding to AT1R ( angiotensin 2 receptor type 1 ) activates the in ﬂ ammatory pathway via NF - κ B signaling . Recent studies have demonstrated that CD147 and furin , as well as clatherin - mediated endocytosis , also induce P13K / Akt signaling ( Khezri , 2021 ) . A recent study has also shown that SARS - CoV - 2 S protein can modulate in ﬂ ammatory responses via the PI3K / Akt pathway to allow propagation of virus at early stages of infection ( Al - Qahtani et al . , 2022 ) . Apart from being exploited by the viruses during their life cycle , the PI3K / Akt pathway also serves to counteract viral invasion by inducing phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 ( IRF3 ) and type I interferons ( IFN - I ) ( Schabbauer et al . , 2008 ; Joung et al . , 2011 ) . Infection with many double / single stranded viruses also activate the PI3K / Akt for TLR - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and RIG - I dependent activation of the IRF3 ( Sarkar et al . , 2004 ; Yeon et al . , 2015 ) . A better understanding of how virus - induced lipid kinase pathways and oxidative stress communicates with the host ’ s antioxidative response , will provide insights into potential antiviral therapeutics that can be discovered and developed for ef ﬁ cient viral disease management . Structure of SARS - CoV - 2 , its life cycle and host cell invasion Coronaviruses have a genome size of 27 – 32 kb , which is generally larger than any other RNA viruses . SARS - CoV - 2 has a genome size of approximately 29 . 9 kb and codes for 4 structural Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin . org 03 Lekshmi et al . 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2023 . 1158133 proteins S ( spike glycoprotein ) , N ( nucleocapsid protein ) , M ( membrane protein ) , and E ( Envelope protein ) , 16 non - structural ( Nsp1 - 16 ) , and nine accessory proteins ( Orf3a , Orf3b , Orf6 , Orf7a , Orf7b , Orf8 , Orf9b , Orf9c , Orf10 ) ( Gordon et al . , 2020 ; Lu et al . , 2020 ; Mariano et al . , 2020 ) ( Figure 1 ) . The proteins S , M , and E make up the viral envelope . The invasion of a host cell , the ﬁ rst step in SARS - CoV - 2 infection , is mediated by the transmembrane spike protein ( 180 – 200 kDa ) . This allows SARS - CoV - 2 virions to attach to the host cell membrane receptors ( ACE2 ) and invade those cells by subsequent fusion of viral and host cell membranes or endocytosis . The nucleocapsid protein N is recruited at the replication - transcription complex by Nsp3 where it plays a multifaceted role in the infection cycle of SARS - CoV - 2 . The N protein bind to and package the viral RNA to form ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) complexes that locates in the internal face of the viral membrane as a separate layer from the envelope proteins S , M and E ( Chang et al . , 2014 ) . N protein has two structured domains that allow it to carry out many functions during the viral life cycle , such as virion assembly , RNA replication / transcription , and immune system interference . Since the domains of the N protein are separated by a long ﬂ exible linker , it has a high degree of conformational freedom ( McBride et al . , 2014 ) . Similarly , the primary function of the membrane protein M , which is embedded by three transmembrane helices , is to drive the assembly of virions to the host cell and maintain other structural proteins at the budding site , and recruit the same by promoting membrane curvature ( Neuman et al . , 2011 ) . Also , SARS - CoV - 2 - M proteins are reported to have high pro - apoptotic properties and induce apoptosis by disrupting the interaction of PDK1 ( 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase 1 ) with cell - survival protein PKB ( protein kinase B ) / Akt in cells expressing M - protein ( Tsoi et al . , 2014 ) . Like M protein , SARS - CoV - 2 envelope protein E also shows oligomerization properties . Coronavirus E protein has only one transmembrane domain that can self - interact to form ion channels and can also establish interactions with the nucleocapsid protein N ( Stertz et al . , 2007 ) . The M protein oligomerizes at the membrane of the intermediary compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi . The interaction of the C - terminus of E with M guides the recruitment of E and initiate virus budding into the host cells ( Pervushin et al . , 2009 ; Schoeman and Fielding , 2019 ) . In response to the viral infection , a “ cytokine storm ” ( also known as hypercytokinemia ) is triggered to induce further in ﬂ ammatory changes in the pneumocytes . Excessive in ﬂ ammation and apoptosis ultimately cause lung damage . The released viruses after cell apoptosis , further infects the adjacent type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in the same manner , resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome ( Jackson et al . , 2022 ) . Even though respiratory epithelial cells are the prime target for SARS - CoV - 2 , both direct and indirect cellular alterations due to virus replication , host response , and the triggered in ﬂ ammatory and hypercoagulative consequences make the condition more lethal ( Bezerra et al . , 2022 ) . COVID - 19 patients mainly exhibit the viral nucleocapsid and spike proteins as main immunogens , and plasma or serum quantitative measurements in SARS - CoV - 2 patients showed the N protein to be more sensitive to the adaptive immune response than the spike protein . This makes it an excellent indicator of early disease development ( Burbelo et al . , 2020 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 infection and oxidative stress Elevated ROS production and higher concentrations of oxidized biomolecules have been reported in the alveolar epithelium and endothelium of patients infected with viruses such as in ﬂ uenza ( Buf ﬁ nton et al . , 1992 ) , rhinovirus ( Martinez et al . , 2016 ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) ( Biagioli et al . , 1999 ) , and many other viruses , however different viruses are known to employ diverse FIGURE 1 ( A ) SARS - CoV - 2 genome ( B ) structure of SARS - CoV - 2 . Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin . org 04 Lekshmi et al . 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2023 . 1158133 molecular mechanisms to exhibit these cellular effects . While maintaining a proper redox homeostasis is very important for the regulated balance of viral - induced ROS - activated immune cell signal transduction , its excessive production may further induce an impaired immune response , in ﬂ ammatory reactions , mitochondrial dysfunction , and apoptosis impacting the disease pathogenesis ( Chernyak et al . , 2020 ) . Mitochondria is the major producer of ROS ( mtROS ) in non - immune cells like endothelial cells while NADPH oxidase ( NOX ) and xanthine oxidase are the major sources of ROS in immune cells ( Vorobjeva et al . , 2017 ) . Most viruses induce oxidative stress in order to facilitate viral replication in the host cell by activating innate immunity via NF - κ B - dependent cytokine production . RSV is also reported to induce ROS production and cytokine burst in host cells . To control the ROS levels these viruses are known to acquire the ability to manipulate Nrf2 dependent antioxidant pathway in their favor . RSV ameliorates glutathione ( GSH ) levels and increases lipid peroxidation in type II epithelial cells of the airway and human alveoli resulting in the downregulation of the Nrf2 pathway . This in turn reduces the expression of Nrf2 - dependent target genes ; superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , hemoxigenase 1 ( HO - 1 / HMOX1 ) , glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) , and glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , and triggers interferon ( IFN ) and Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) pathway to combat the virus infection ( Jamaluddin et al . , 2009 ) . The mechanism however , is different for the in ﬂ uenza virus . The in ﬂ uenza virus induces oxidative stress but it also favors translocation of Nrf2 and thereby activates the antioxidant defense mechanism for its survival in the host cells ( Imai et al . , 2008 ) . Oxidative stress is reported as the agent provocateur behind most viral infections and thus the host cell signaling activation accompanied by oxidative stress may have a profound impact on the pathogenesis of COVID - 19 and related disorders . A recent study found that the activation of Nrf2 / HMOX1 signi ﬁ cantly suppressed SARS - CoV - 2 replication through production of the metabolite biliverdin in different cell types . The same study also demonstrated that the virus impaired the Nrf2 / HMOX1 axis through its NSP14 which interacted with the catalytic domain of the NAD - dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) thereby inhibiting the Nfr2 / HMOX1 pathway . While this ﬁ nding revealed the crucial role of a viral protein in dysregulating the host antioxidant defense system , it further emphasized the important role of SIRT1 / Nrf2 pathway in the host cell for the pathological management of SARS - CoV - 2 infection via an antioxidant defense mechanism ( Zhang et al . , 2022 ) . Similarly , the Nrf2 - dependent antioxidant pathway have been found to be suppressed in the biopsies of COVID - 19 patients but interestingly the Nrf2 agonists like dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) and 4 - ocy - itaconate ( 4 - OI ) were reported to induce cellular antiviral effects that could inhibit the replication of SARS - CoV - 2 by suppressing the pro - in ﬂ ammatory response of the SARS - CoV - 2 ( Olagnier et al . , 2020 ) . Nrf2 has also been reported as an important transcriptional repressor of the in ﬂ ammatory genes in macrophages by blocking the transcription of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines , most notably interleukin1 β ( IL - 1 β ) ( Hayes and Dinkova - Kostova , 2014 ) . The main protease ( Mpro ) in SARS - CoV - 2 responsible for viral polyprotein processing is called 3C - like protease ( 3CLpro ) or 3 - chymotrypsin - like - proteases , a highly conserved protease among coronaviruses . It is a cysteine protease that corresponds to Nsp5 of coronavirus and acts as a potential drug target for antiviral therapy against the coronavirus . Several protease covalent inhibitors targeting 3CLpro like CLpro - 1 , GC376 , rupintrivir ( formerly AG7088 ) , lufotrelvir ( PF - 07304814 ) have already been discovered by structural - based drug designs which are advantageous with low minimum side effects and maximum therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy . Of these , the prodrug PF - 07304814 ( lufotrelvir ) entered clinical trials in September 2020 ( Owen et al . , 2021 ) . As the Nrf2 pathway plays a signi ﬁ cant role in the pathophysiology of both host cells and viruses , Nrf2 modulators have been recommended as promising supplements for the treatment of viral infections by reducing the effects of virus - induced oxidative stress . In 2021 , Qi Sun and co - workers discovered oleanolic acid - derived semi - synthetic triterpenoids like bardoxolone and bardoxolone methyl compounds with electrophilic moieties as 3CL pro inhibitors that may covalently bind to the active site cysteine of SARS - CoV - 2 3CLpro . These compounds were identi ﬁ ed as Nrf2 activators that can inhibit the NF - κ B pathway promoting resolution of in ﬂ ammation , inhibiting viral replication , and thereby facilitating cytoprotection and tissue repair ( Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) . Using a murine model of infection and airway epithelial cells , Qu et al . demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 can alter cellular redox balance and inhibit Nrf2 - mediated antioxidant responses . Infection with SARS - CoV2 downregulated Nrf2 protein levels and Nrf2 - dependent gene expression , resulting in increased in ﬂ ammation and disease progression . In addition , mice lacking the Nrf2 gene exhibited worse clinical signs , had increased in ﬂ ammation , and showed a tendency toward higher lung viral titers , demonstrating that Nrf2 has a protective role during SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The results of this study provided a mechanistic explanation for the oxidative unbalance associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection , suggesting that activating Nrf2 by pharmacological agents could be a therapeutic strategy for COVID - 19 ( Qu et al . , 2023 ) . Similar observations have been reported for other viruses . In 2006 , Jiang et al . discovered that α - Luminol ( monosodium 5 - amino - 2 - 3 - dihydro - 1 - 4 - phthalazine dione ) , an anti - in ﬂ ammatory drug extensively used by Russian scientists , was able to suppress oxidative stress induced by the infection of temperature sensitive mutant virus Moloney murine leukemia virus ( MoMuLV ts - 1 ) ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) . In COVID - 19 patients , in addition to viral propagation , the in ﬂ ammatory response of host cells is also important in determining the disease outcome and fatality . In most viral infections the lethality is found to be associated with the in ﬂ ammatory response orchestrated by the host immune system through cytokine storm rather than the cytolytic action of the pathogen ( Fung et al . , 2020 ; Guan et al . , 2020 ) . For the comprehensive management of SARS - CoV - 2 , it is always advised to introduce an anti - in ﬂ ammatory and antioxidant therapy to complement an antiviral therapy to control in ﬂ ammation without altering the host cell ’ s adaptive immunity against the infected virus . Role of PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 pathway in SARS - CoV - 2 infection induced in ﬂ ammation Cellular homeostasis and responses to stress and in ﬂ ammation are regulated by Nrf2 through NF - ĸ B - dependent pathways . There is Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin . org 05 Lekshmi et al . 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2023 . 1158133 compelling evidence that Nrf2 is capable of counteracting NF - ĸ B - driven in ﬂ ammation in many experimental models ( Tu et al . , 2019 ) . The SARS - CoV - 2 infection has similar pathophysiology to SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV infections , with aggressive in ﬂ ammatory responses strongly implicated in the damage to the lungs . COVID - 19 is a multifactorial and complex disease that primarily FIGURE 2 Graphicalabstractshowingthesigni ﬁ cance ofP13K / Akt / Nrf2signaling pathway forthemanagementofSARS - CoV - 2infectionviamodulatinghost cellin ﬂ ammatoryresponses , antioxidantmechanismandlipidmetabolism . 1 – 9 : SARS - CoV - 2entersatargetcellbyeitherfusionorendocytosisfollowed byreleaseofgeneticmaterial .

Hepatocytes , monocytes , and other endothelial cells are also found to be susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection , and evidence suggests that virus - induced hyperin ﬂ ammation can be triggered by virus - mediated intracellular sensing pathways in cellular targets ( Figure 2 ) . Similar to several other viral infections , the alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages recognize pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , such as viral RNA , and damage - associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) , such as ATP , DNA , and ASC oligomers , using a variety of pattern - recognition receptors ( PRRs ) during SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Huang et al . , 2020 ; Asha et al . , 2021 ) . These activated monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells in ﬁ ltrate into the target cells and cause the release of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines and chemokines , like TNF - α , IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , CCl2 , MCP1 and IP 10 upon interaction of viral particles with antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) . The release of these indicators of T helper 1 ( TH1 ) cell - polarized response results in severe lung damage and multi - organ dysfunction . IL - 1 β is known to induce pyroptosis and is also found to be elevated during SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Tang et al . , 2021 ) . These data strongly suggest that a COVID - 19 patient ’ s disease severity is not only in ﬂ uenced by the virus but also by the host ’ s immune response . SARS - CoV - 2 infection has been reported to initiate cell death by both apoptosis and necroptosis pathways . In a SARS - CoV - 2 - infected HFH4 - hACE2 ( Hepatocyte nuclear factor - 3 / forkhead homolog 4 - human Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ) transgenic mouse model and in the postmortem lung sections of deceased COVID - 19 patients , SARS - CoV - 2 infection was found to activate caspase - 8 to trigger cell apoptosis and in ﬂ ammatory cytokine processing in the lung epithelial cells . The study further revealed massive in ﬂ ammatory cell in ﬁ ltration and pulmonary interstitial ﬁ brosis , typical of immune pathogenesis as the reason of excessive lung damage in those diseased patients ( Li et al . , 2020 ) . Such ﬁ ndings may assist in the development of speci ﬁ c therapeutic strategies to treat COVID - 19 . ACE2 - associated lung injury has also been suggested by both SARS - CoV infection and in ﬂ ammatory cytokines such as IL - 1 β and TNF - α through enhancement of ACE2 shedding ( Haga et al . , 2008 ) . In a study on SARS - CoV and human coronavirus NL63 infection , the spike protein was found to modulate ACE2 ( Haga et al . , 2008 ; Glowacka et al . , 2010 ) . The loss of pulmonary ACE2 function occurs as a result of the loss of catalytically active ACE2 ectodomains . Ultimately , this resulted in acute lung injury by disrupting the renin - angiotensin system and enhancing in ﬂ ammation and vascular permeability . The action of disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 ( ADAM17 , also known as TNF - α cleavage enzyme , TACE ) constitutively sheds ACE2 to release enzymatically active soluble ACE2 ( sACE2 ) . Since SARS - CoV S protein - induced ACE2 shedding is tightly coupled with TNF - α production in cell culture conditions , it is possible that sACE2 plays a role in the in ﬂ ammatory response to SARS - CoV and possibly SARS - CoV - 2 as well ( Haga et al . , 2008 ; Fu et al . , 2020 ) . Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) is a vasoconstrictor that produces oxidative stress via ROS production and elevated blood pressure . In general ACE converts Ang I to Ang II which in turn is converted into Ang by ACE2 . Ang remains bound to MAS receptor , a G protein - coupled receptor for Ang , in various tissues including the heart , brain , kidney , etc . To protect against aneurysms by activating PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 pathway ( Shimada et al . , 2015 ; Kamel et al . , 2018 ) . A recent study identi ﬁ ed 34 compounds with anti - SARS - CoV - 2 activity that targeted the mTOR / P13K / Akt pathway and DNA - damage response signaling pathways to block SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Garcia et al . , 2021 ) . The kinase inhibitor berzosertib also blocked the SARS - CoV - 2 at post entry levels in target epithelial cells ( Garcia et al . , 2021 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated the crucial role of ACE2 / Ang / MAS axis in activating the Akt signaling to manage oxidative stress , in ﬂ ammation , and hepatic steatosis ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) and that Akt inhibitors signi ﬁ cantly reduce the ACE2 mediated lipid metabolism , thereby providing insights to manage the SARS - CoV - 2 infection - induced metabolic changes in host cells ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) . Uncontrolled in ﬂ ammatory responses known as the cytokine storms have been reported previously in case of SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV infections giving rise to heightened immune response leading to overproduction of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines such as the IL - 6 , TNF - α and IL - 1 β ( Teijaro , 2017 ) . SARS - CoV2 infection is also known to active immune response , more speci ﬁ cally in older adults or those with comorbidity , to a level that can give rise to uncontrolled in ﬂ ammatory responses ( Nile et al . , 2020 ) . It is very crucial to control excessive in ﬂ ammation in COVID - 19 patients with severe disease at right time , in absence of which , the condition quickly deteriorates leading to acute respiratory failure , cardiac damage or multi - organ failure ( Costela - Ruiz et al . , 2020 ) . Naturally occurring phytochemicals , since decades , have been in use as therapeutics to manage diseases with minimal or no side effects . Flavonoids are secondary plant metabolites that have been shown to have anti - viral , anti - in ﬂ ammatory and immunomodulatory activities ( Chen et al . , 2018 ; Hosseinzade et al . , 2019 ; Liskova et al . , 2020 ; Badshah et al . , 2021 ) . For example , Smilax campestris aqueous extract , containing the catechin and derivatives of quercetin , has been shown to reduce the production of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines such as the TNF - α , IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and MCP - 1 in lipopolysaccharide - activated macrophages derived from THP - 1 cells ( Salaverry et al . , 2020 ) . Hesperetin and chrysin have been shown to have immunomodulatory potential in physiological and pathological conditions through the cellular as well as humoral responses ( Sassi et al . , 2017 ) . Similarly , many ﬂ avonoids have also been demonstrated to exert immunomodulatory activities against human coronaviruses and in silico studies have further provided evidence that these ﬂ avonoids have potential to bind to ACE2 protein and ultimately inhibit the production of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines ( Ngwa et al . , 2020 ) thus making them an attractive therapeutic agent . Likewise , rhamnocitrin , a ﬂ avonoid extracted from Nervilia fordii , has shown its potential to inhibit the endothelial activation ( via miR - 185 / STIM - 1 / SOCE / NFATc3 ) which is responsible for excessive cytokine production . Since a similar endothelial activation in case of SARS - CoV or COVID - 19 have also been documented , rhamnocitrin may serve as potential modulator of the cytokine storm and effective management of COVID - 19 ( Lin et al . , 2020 ) . Recent reports suggest the direct or indirect role of the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway in SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV - Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin . org 07 Lekshmi et al . 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2023 . 1158133 2 infection ( Mizutani et al . , 2005 ; Kindrachuk et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2021b ) . This signaling pathway has also shown to be the target of some ﬂ avonoids such as the quercetin , hesperidin , acacetin , geninstein , silibinin and delphinidin among many others ( reviewed in ( Zughaibi et al . , 2021 ) ) wherein they inhibit the deregulated signaling signi ﬁ cantly in different types of cancer . NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome has also been shown to be regulated by PI3K / Akt signaling in atherosclerosis and inhibitors of PI3K ( GDC0941 ) and Akt ( MK2206 ) signi ﬁ cantly reduced the activation of NLRP3 and expression levels of p - p65 / p65 . The inhibitors further reduced the mitochondrial ROS in THP - 1 cells and mice model ( Liu et al . , 2021 ) . Since NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome is also reported to be activated by SARS - CoV - 2 , it ’ s imperative to understand the management of virus induced ROS and in ﬂ ammatory response by modulating the PI3k / Akt signaling pathways using the anti - in ﬂ ammatory and immunomodulatory properties of ﬂ avonoids . These natural products might be very helpful in minimizing the SARS - CoV - 2 complications by regulating in ﬂ ammatory mediators and endothelial activation by toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome , Nrf2 , bromodomain - containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) , or 3CL pro ( Liskova et al . , 2021 ) . COVID - 19 disease severity has also been correlated with TLR2 and MYD88 expressions , and it has been observed that TLR2 senses the SARS - CoV - 2 envelope protein to produce in ﬂ ammatory cytokines . MyD88 , the adaptor protein for TLRs , leads to the activation of NF - ĸ B and MAPKs for the production of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines . As a result of TLR2 and Myd88 activation , during coronavirus infection , TLR2 - dependent signaling leads to the production of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines independent of viral entry . In healthy tissues , the TLR - mediated signaling leads to the activation of the PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 pathway for the positive regulation of cell growth ( Laird et al . , 2009 ; Zheng et al . , 2021 ) . In light of these data , better therapeutic strategies to counter the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic could be developed and effectively manage disease burden . SARS - CoV - 2 infection and host lipid metabolism Lipids are one of the fundamental components of a cell that make up the structural building blocks . As a signaling and energy storage molecule , it has a wide range of biological functions . Lipid plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle . The enveloped viruses , like SARS - CoV - 2 , are surrounded by a lipid bilayer and each step of the viral infection such as fusion of membrane to host cell , endocytosis , viral replication , maturation , and exocytosis utilizes host lipid metabolism ( Abu - Farha et al . , 2020 ) . The coronaviruses create double - membrane vesicles ( DMVs ) , a membranous structure consisting of viral proteins and some host factor , for viral genome ampli ﬁ cation after seizing the intracellular membrane of host cells . Such a lipid micro - environment that contains speci ﬁ c phospholipid composition is ideal for viral replication . Recent studies have shown that an important lipid processing enzyme belonging to the phospholipase A2 superfamily , cytosolic phospholipase A2 enzyme ( cPLA2 ) is crucial for DMV formation and viral replication ( Muller et al . , 2018 ) . Fatty acids and cholesterol are the inevitable components of viral replication as they constitute the major component of the viral membrane . Therefore , Acetyl - CoA carboxylase ( ACC ) , fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) , and 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methyl - glutaryl - CoA reductase ( HMG - CoA reductase , the major modulators of lipid metabolism , can act as possible antiviral targets against SARS - CoV2 infection ( Heaton and Randall , 2011 ) . The recent studies on HIV infection ( Kulkarni et al . , 2017 ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection ( Yang et al . , 2008 ) , and Epstein – Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic and latent infection ( Li et al . , 2004 ) con ﬁ rmed this hypothesis . An increase in the intracellular level of FAS was observed in all these conditions and it was also evident that FAS inhibition impaired the replication of the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) and other respiratory viruses ( Ohol et al . , 2015 ) . These ﬁ ndings make this enzyme a novel host - dependent antiviral target . The intracellular levels of fatty acids and cholesterol are regulated by a feedback mechanism mediated by SREBPs ( Sterol regulatory element binding proteins ) , which are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as inactive precursors . When the cells are deprived of cholesterol , SREBPs are proteolytically cleaved and the active SREBP migrates to the nucleus for the transcriptional regulation of genes responsible for lipid metabolism . This can also be a potential candidate related to lipid metabolism - related antiviral approaches , that can also be modulated by the PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 pathway ( Ye and DeBose - Boyd , 2011 ) . The major cellular receptors of SARS - CoV - 2 , ACE2 may be expressed in cholesterol - rich domains of lipid bilayer known as lipid rafts that serve as an entry port for certain viruses especially enveloped viruses . An experiment conducted in Vero E6 cells revealed that integrity of lipid rafts was required for productive infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) ( Lu et al . , 2008 ) . The role of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( PPARs ) , belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily , as an antiviral candidate is a recent matter of investigation during the COVID - 19 pandemic . There are mainly 3 subtypes of PPAR receptors : PPAR α , PPAR γ , and PPAR β / δ that play well - established roles in cellular differentiation , proliferation , energetic homeostasis , glucose , and lipid metabolism . Several in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that the stimulation of PPAR by natural or synthetic agonists like curcumin , capsaicin , and eicosapentaenoic acid could prevent cytokine overproduction and the in ﬂ ammatory cascade associated with virus infections ( Ciavarella et al . , 2020 ; Fantacuzzi et al . , 2022 ) . Pioglitazone , a PPAR agonist , is also proposed as an effective treatment in COVID - 19 people affected by type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular complications , and hypertension by reducing in ﬂ ammatory parameters and also by inhibiting 3CLpro thereby downregulating SARS - CoV - 2 RNA synthesis and replication ( Carboni et al . , 2020 ) . There is evidence that the PPAR α / γ - adenosine 5 ′ - monophosphate - ( AMP - ) activated protein kinase - ( AMPK - ) sirtuin - 1 ( SIRT1 ) pathway and fatty acid metabolism may be involved in in ﬂ uenza A virus ( IAV ) replication and pneumonia caused by IAV ( Bei et al . , 2021 ) . These all synergistically work together to inhibit NF - κ B signaling and suppress in ﬂ ammation . Furthermore , Nrf2 and antioxidant response element ( ARE ) pathways also interact mutually with , PPAR α / γ - AMPK to inhibit in ﬂ ammation , constituting a positive feedback loop ( Kauppinen et al . , 2013 ) . In adipose tissue , Gamma - oryzanol , the principal bioactive constituent of ice bran , reduced the Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin . org 08 Lekshmi et al . 10 . 3389 / fmolb . 2023 . 1158133 levels of TNF - α , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) , and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) ( Francisqueti - Ferron et al . , 2021 ) . Due to its potent and multi - PPAR activity , astaxanthin has been investigated as a therapeutic strategy to regulate in ﬂ ammatory and immune responses , contrast cytokine storms , and prevent in ﬂ ammatory effects following COVID - 19 ( Talukdar et al . , 2020 ) . PI3K / Akt pathway is also known to play a signi ﬁ cant role in host lipid biogenesis as revealed by the study on goose hepatocyte where researchers observed that inhibition of the PI3K - Akt - mTOR pathway drastically reduced the lipids accumulation in hepatocytes ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) s . These alternative approaches that are under development , when backed up by clinical trials , can potentially be promising tools for reducing the pathophysiological complications of SARS - COV - 2 infections . Conclusion and future perspectives Despite the widespread use of vaccines , the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 infection is on the rise , which enables new variants to emerge frequently . As a consequence of this unprecedented threat in the 21st century , to alleviate case fatality and patients ’ symptoms , therapeutic interventions are urgently needed to compliment currently available vaccines . It is still required to conduct studies to develop a universal vaccine against COVID - 19 , which can neutralize all variants of SARS - CoV - 2 . Viruses and hosts have a strict interplay that can be destructed through metabolic disruption , which is an attractive novel strategy to combat viral infections . In this regard , broad spectrum antiviral compounds that target PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 signaling pathways to offer host - mediated antiviral responses in every manner , may be considered as the best drug candidates for the future management of COVID - 19 and related post - COVID syndromes . Several FDA - approved inhibitors targetting PI3K and Akt are in use in clinical settings ( Basile et al . , 2022 ) . While most of the inhibitors of PI3K are used to treat some forms of cancer , its utility in viral infections have not been reported adequately . Similarly the Akt inhibitor ( Miltefosine ) have been in use for Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis ( Sundar and Olliaro , 2007 ) , however the role in viral infections are still limited to research settings ( Sharma et al . , 2018 ) . The processes of oxidative stress , in ﬂ ammation , and changes in lipid metabolism are interconnected and all contribute to both SARS - CoV - 2 infection and post - COVID - 19 complications . According to the World Health Organization , many patients are experiencing short - to long - term post - COVID - 19 sequelae such as cardiovascular , neurological , nephrological , gastro - intestinal , and even psychological effects . A major cause of mortality was reported to be thromboembolism , the cumulative risk product of all the above discussed pathophysiological conditions . PI3K / Akt pathway is known to be an important regulator of coagulation pathways and hence a key player in disease modulation ( Shan et al . , 2019 ) . Another critical area of concern is the ‘ postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ’ ( POTS ) occurring after SARS - CoV - 2 infection or COVID - 19 vaccination . POTS is a condition in which there is an increase in heart rate of at least 30 beats per minute within 10 min of standing . SARS - CoV - 2 infected people and those who have been vaccinated against COVID - 19 have had an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) , but it is unclear if this is due to the virus infection or the vaccination ( Blitshteyn and Fedorowski , 2022 ) . The situation is unfortunate as there is no complete cure . However , the overall immunity can be strengthened in order to compete with viral infections . Reports indicate that the best natural immunity boosters are functional foods that offer health bene ﬁ ts beyond their nutritional values . Incorporating functional food ingredients in diet can activate cell survival pathways like PI3K / Akt / Nrf2 , that can reduce long - term health risks associated with COVID - 19 . Overall , in this review article , we propose potential anti - in ﬂ ammatory and antioxidant therapies that can also regulate lipid metabolism by targeting transcription factor Nrf2 via the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway . Combined , the research discussed in this article strongly suggests that activating Nrf2 could be a promising strategy for combating COVID - 19 . Further investigations along this line are needed to develop ef ﬁ cient counteracting strategies to ameliorate disease severity and improve treatment outcomes , especially for patients with underlying complications .
