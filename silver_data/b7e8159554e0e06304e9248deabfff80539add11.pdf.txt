These changes , 4 collectively called capacitation , culminate in the exocyto - 5 sis of the acrosome , a large vesicle overlying the nucleus . 6 Acrosomal exocytosis is not an all - or - nothing event , but 7 rather a regulated process in which vesicle cargo disperses 8 gradually . However , the structural mechanisms underlying 9 this controlled release remain undeﬁned . In addition , un - 10 like other exocytotic events , fusing membranes are shed as 11 vesicles ; the cell thus loses the entire anterior two - thirds of 12 its plasma membrane and yet remains intact while the re - 13 maining non - vesiculated plasma membrane becomes fuso - 14 genic . Precisely how cell integrity is maintained through - 15 out this drastic vesiculation process is unclear , as is how 16 it ultimately leads to the acquisition of fusion competence . 17 Here , we use cryo - electron tomography to visualize these 18 processes in unﬁxed , unstained , fully - hydrated sperm . We 19 show that crystalline structures within the acrosome disas - 20 semble during capacitation and acrosomal exocytosis , rep - 21 resenting a plausible mechanism for gradual dispersal of the 22 acrosomal matrix . We ﬁnd that the architecture of the sperm 23 head supports an atypical membrane ﬁssion - fusion pathway 24 that maintains cell integrity . Finally , we detail how the acro - 25 some reaction transforms both the micron - scale topography 26 and the nano - scale protein landscape of the sperm surface , 27 thus priming the sperm for fertilization . 28 sperm | fertilization | acrosome reaction | membrane fusion | cryo - electron 29 tomography 30 Signiﬁcance 31 Mammalian sperm must undergo a complex series of bio - 32 chemical and morphological changes in the female reproduc - 33 tive tract in order to become fertilization - competent . These 34 changes culminate in acrosomal exocytosis , during which 35 multiple membrane fusions destabilize the acrosomal vesicle 36 and liberate its contents , which include proteins implicated in 37 penetrating and binding to the egg vestments . Here , we use 38 cryo - electron tomography to visualize acrosomal exocytosis 39 intermediates in unﬁxed , unstained sperm . Our results sug - 40 gest structural bases for how gradual dispersal of acrosome 41 contents is regulated , as well as for how the cell remains in - 42 tact after losing much of its plasma membrane , We also show 43 that acrosomal exocytosis transforms both the micron - scale 44 topography and the nano - scale molecular landscape of the 45 sperm surface , thus priming it for interaction and fusion with 46 the egg . These ﬁndings yield important insights into sperm 47 physiology and contribute to our understanding of the funda - 48 mental yet enigmatic process of mammalian fertilization . 49 Introduction 50 Mammalian sperm must reside in the female reproductive 51 tract for several hours before they are able to fertilize the egg . 52 During this time , sperm undergo a plethora of biochemical 53 changes collectively called capacitation ( Aitken and Nixon , 54 2013 ; Bailey , 2010 ; Gervasi and Visconti , 2016 ) . The dis - 55 covery of this phenomenon was crucial to the development 56 of in vitro fertilization ( Austin , 1951 ; Chang , 1951 , 1959 ) . 57 Capacitation is characterized by cholesterol efﬂux , phospho - 58 lipase activation , and altered membrane ﬂuidity , along with 59 a multitude of biochemical changes ( Bailey , 2010 ; Harrison 60 and Gadella , 2005 ; Nolan and Hammerstedt , 1997 ; Travis 61 and Kopf , 2002 ) . Together , these changes render sperm capa - 62 ble of undergoing the acrosome reaction , a unique exocytotic 63 event that is an absolute requirement for sperm to become 64 fusion - competent ( Yanagimachi , 1981 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . 65 The acrosome is a large regulated secretory vesicle over - 66 lying the anterior two - thirds of the nucleus ; its crucial role 67 in mammalian fertilization manifests in the fact that malfor - 68 mation of the acrosome causes infertility in both humans and 69 mice . Three distinct segments of the acrosome can be de - 70 ﬁned based on their positions along the sperm head ( Fig . 1a ) : 71 the apical segment extends beyond the nucleus and forms the 72 most anterior region of the acrosome ; the principal or pre - 73 equatorial segment forms the major part of the acrosome ; 74 and the equatorial segment delimits the posterior part of the 75 acrosome . During acrosomal exocytosis , the plasma mem - 76 brane fuses with the outer acrosomal membrane at multiple 77 points . This destabilizes the acrosome and liberates its con - 78 tents , which include several proteins implicated in either pen - 79 etrating through or binding to the egg vestments ( Foster and 80 Gerton , 2016 ) . 81 Acrosomal exocytosis is not an all - or - nothing event but in - 82 stead involves the gradual dispersal of vesicle cargo ( Hardy 83 et al . , 1991 ; Kim and Gerton , 2003 ; Kim et al . , 2001 ) . Bio - 84 chemical analyses deﬁned two classes of acrosome contents : 85 a soluble fraction that is released shortly after the onset of 86 the acrosome reaction , and a matrix fraction that disperses 87 more slowly . Consistent with this , conventional electron 88 microscopy ( EM ) studies showed discrete zones within the 89 acrosome , including crystalline material that extends across 90 large areas of the vesicle in sperm from several mammalian 91 Leung et al . | July 30 , 2021 | 1 – 19 species ( Fléchon , 2016 ; Olson and Winfrey , 1994 ; Phillips , 92 1972 ) . However , the structural changes in the acrosomal ma - 93 trix that lead to differential release of acrosome contents are 94 unclear . 95 Another distinctive feature of acrosomal exocytosis is the 96 lack of membrane recycling . The plasma membrane and the 97 outer acrosomal membrane are shed as vesicles , so the sperm 98 head loses a large portion of its limiting membrane while the 99 remainder becomes fusogenic . Acrosome vesiculation has 100 been studied extensively with classical EM ( Barros et al . , 101 1967 ; Flaherty and Olson , 1991 ; Jamil and White , 1981 ; Na - 102 gae et al . , 1986 ; Russell et al . , 1979 ; Sosa et al . , 2015 ; Stock 103 and Fraser , 1987 ; Yudin et al . , 1988 ; Zanetti and Mayorga , 104 2009 ) , identifying acrosome swelling and membrane dock - 105 ing as clear intermediates leading to exocytosis ( Sosa et al . , 106 2015 ; Tsai et al . , 2010 ; Zanetti and Mayorga , 2009 ) , How - 107 ever , the membrane remodeling pathways that ensure the cell 108 remains intact throughout this dramatic vesiculation process 109 remain undeﬁned . 110 Here , we use cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) to im - 111 age sperm undergoing in vitro capacitation and acrosome ex - 112 ocytosis . Cryo - ET provides three - dimensional information 113 about rare events in unﬁxed , unstained , fully - hydrated sam - 114 ples , and thus in close to native conditions ( Ng and Gan , 115 2020 ) . We show that the crystalline component of the acro - 116 somal matrix gradually dissolves during acrosomal exocyto - 117 sis , explaining the differential release previously observed . 118 We also ﬁnd that the deﬁned ultrastructural organization of 119 the sperm head facilitates a unique ﬁssion - fusion mechanism 120 that maintains cell integrity despite drastic membrane vesic - 121 ulation . We demonstrate that acrosome exocytosis also fa - 122 cilitates massive membrane protein re - localization onto the 123 post - acrosomal plasma membrane , building a platform for in - 124 teraction with the egg . 125 Results 126 In unstimulated sperm , the plasma membrane ( PM ) 127 and the outer acrosomal membrane ( OAM ) are closely 128 apposed along the entire acrosome . We plunge - froze 129 sperm from highly fertile , commercial artiﬁcial insemination 130 pigs ( Sus scrofa domestica ) and imaged them using cryo - ET . 131 In intact unstimulated sperm , the plasma membrane ( PM ) and 132 the outer acrosomal membrane ( OAM ) are closely apposed 133 along the entire acrosome ( Fig . 1b , c ; Fig . S1 ) . The PM and 134 the OAM are ~ 8 - 10 nm apart and lie parallel to each other 135 until the equatorial segment of the acrosome , where the vesi - 136 cle tapers ( Fig . S1d - f ) . This differs from many classical EM 137 images of unstimulated sperm , in which the PM and OAM 138 appear wavy with estimated interbilayer distances of > 10 nm 139 ( Sosa et al . , 2015 ; Tsai et al . , 2010 ; Zanetti and Mayorga , 140 2009 ) , and demonstrates the beneﬁts of using cryo - ET to vi - 141 sualise acrosomal exocytosis . 142 The crystalline fraction of the acrosomal matrix pro - 143 gressively disassembles during exocytosis . We sought 144 to determine how the internal organization of the acrosome 145 changes during acrosomal exocytosis . We ﬁrst imaged acro - 146 some contents in intact unstimulated sperm cells thinned to 147 ~ 150 - 200 nm with cryo - focused ion beam ( cryo - FIB ) milling 148 ( Marko et al . , 2006 ; Rigort et al . , 2012 ) . Even after thinning 149 and imaging with the Volta phase plate ( VPP ) ( Danev et al . , 150 2014 ; Fukuda et al . , 2015 ) , the acrosome lumen was still very 151 dense ( Fig . 1b , c ) . Nonetheless , we observed large patches 152 of crystalline material in both the apical and pre - equatorial 153 regions of the acrosome ( insets in Fig . 1b , c ) , similar to 154 the structures observed in rat sperm ( Phillips , 1972 ) , rabbit 155 sperm ( Olson and Winfrey , 1994 ) , and ram sperm ( Fléchon , 156 2016 ) . 157 To visualise acrosomal exocytosis , we imaged sperm incu - 158 bated in capacitating media ( containing calcium , bicarbon - 159 ate , and bovine serum albumin ) for ~ 2 h and subsequently 160 treated with calcium ionophore A23187 ( Fig . S2 ) or proges - 161 terone for up to 30 min . Following treatment , fully acrosome - 162 reacted sperm could be readily targeted in low - magniﬁcation 163 cryo - EM projection images ( Fig . S3 ) . These cells were sur - 164 rounded by a cloud of vesicles ( the acrosomal shroud ) ( Fig . 165 S3a ) and their apical regions had become very thin due to the 166 loss of the acrosome ( Fig . S3b ) , allowing us to image them 167 without cryo - FIB milling . We note that acrosomal shrouds 168 tend to remain associated with sperm heads despite several 169 pipetting and dilution steps before imaging . In our analyses , 170 we excluded sperm in which the plasma membrane peeled off 171 at the equatorial / post - acrosomal regions , which would likely 172 result in loss of cell integrity and thus in cell death ( Fig . S3c - 173 d ) . 174 We found that the acrosomal shroud consists of a highly 175 heterogeneous population of vesicles that are decorated with 176 membrane proteins ( Fig . 1e , f ) . Interspersed between these 177 vesicles are the contents of the acrosome , including striking 178 crystalloid patches that were heterogeneous in both size and 179 shape ( Fig . 1e ; Fig . S4a , b ) ( ionophore : 12 / 13 tomograms , 180 each from a different cell , from 3 different animals ; proges - 181 terone : 5 / 5 tomograms , each from a different cell , from 1 182 animal ) . 183 To follow the crystalloids during intermediate stages of 184 exocytosis , we imaged cells incubated in capacitating media 185 without ionophore treatment . Crystalloids were readily visi - 186 ble in swollen acrosomes ( Fig . 1d ) , where they had already 187 begun to dissociate into smaller fragments . We then used 188 subtomogram averaging to resolve the structure of the crys - 189 talloid patches at a resolution of ~ 30 - 40 Å ( Fig . 2 ) . We chose 190 to average from capacitated sperm since the surrounding ma - 191 terial was too dense in naïve sperm . The patches were also 192 larger in capacitated sperm than in the shrouds of acrosome - 193 reacted sperm , which facilitated averaging by increasing par - 194 ticle numbers . Our averages reveal that the crystalloids adopt 195 a tetragonal body - centered crystal lattice with apparent unit 196 cell dimensions a = 28 nm , b = 28 nm , c = 40 nm . 197 Taken together , our data indicate that the crystalloids in 198 the acrosomal shroud result from disassembly of an initial 199 larger superstructure . These crystalloids may thus represent 200 the core of the acrosomal matrix , acting as a structural scaf - 201 fold onto which soluble components of the acrosome are 202 anchored . Their progressive disassembly may represent a 203 2 | Leung et al . | cryo - electron tomography of acrosomal exocytosis Fig . 1 .

We then 207 sought to trace membrane remodelling intermediates in - 208 volved in capacitation and acrosomal exocytosis . Sperm 209 within an ejaculate are inherently variable ( Buffone et al . , 210 2014 ) , which precludes a strictly timepoint - based assess - 211 ment of the reaction coordinate . We instead imaged sev - 212 eral cells from several different animals ( Table S1 ) , analysed 213 the dataset for membrane remodelling intermediates that we 214 could observe consistently , and ordered these stages relative 215 to one another ( Fig . 3 , Fig . 4 ) . 216 We captured a range of intermediates already in capaci - 217 tated sperm without ionophore stimulation ( Fig . 3 ) , includ - 218 ing acrosome swelling , membrane docking , and membrane 219 destabilization ( Fig . S5 ) . Acrosome swelling is one of the 220 earliest stages of acrosomal exocytosis ( Sosa et al . , 2015 ; 221 Zanetti and Mayorga , 2009 ) , and indeed was observed even 222 in capacitated cells ( Boerke et al . , 2014 ) . Swelling is associ - 223 ated with decondensation of acrosomal contents , but our to - 224 mograms reveal that decondensation is not uniform . Specif - 225 ically , a dense core remains near the center of the vesicle 226 ( white arrowhead in Fig . 3b ) , which is continuous with a 227 thin streak of electron - dense material sandwiched between 228 the OAM and the IAM at the end of the acrosome ( white ar - 229 rowhead in Fig . 4b ) . Decondensation also improves contrast 230 in the acrosome , making visible large membrane protein den - 231 sities on the luminal surface of the OAM ( green arrowhead 232 in Fig . 3b , c ) . These structures are also visible in VPP tomo - 233 grams of FIB - milled unstimulated sperm ( green arrowheads 234 in Fig . 1b inset and Fig . 3a ) . The OAM proteins form rows 235 of teeth - like densities , each extending ~ 14 nm into the OAM 236 lumen and spaced ~ 18 nm from its neighbours . 237 We could further distinguish between two stages of acro - 238 some swelling : one in which the acrosome swells but the 239 overlying membranes are still intact ( Fig . 3b , e ) , and another 240 in which the OAM already destabilizes ( Fig . 3c , f ) . OAM 241 destabilization is characterised by local membrane rupture 242 ( Fig . 3c , f ; Fig . 4c ; Fig . S5g - l ) . OAM rupture was associated 243 with the extent of acrosome swelling ; in cells with ruptured 244 OAMs , the acrosome had swollen to nearly twice its original 245 width ( 136 ± 24 nm versus 71 ± 11 nm , with an intermediate 246 value of 100 ± 18 nm in cells with swollen acrosomes but 247 intact membranes ) ( Fig . 3g ) . In contrast , the width of the 248 equatorial segment did not change signiﬁcantly even in cells 249 with ruptured OAMs ( acrosome swollen , membranes desta - 250 bilized : 38 ± 2 nm ; acrosome swollen , membranes intact : 38 251 4 | Leung et al . | cryo - electron tomography of acrosomal exocytosis Fig . 3 .

No - 252 tably , OAM rupture occurred just anterior to the equatorial 253 segment , on average 260 ± 80 nm from the end of the acro - 254 some ( mean ± s . d . , 8 tomograms , each from a different cell ) 255 ( Fig . 3f ) . 256 Focusing on the equatorial segment , we observed an atypi - 257 cal membrane ﬁssion - fusion pathway that mediates resealing 258 of the sperm head ( Fig . 4 ) . The ruptured end of the OAM 259 fuses with the overlying PM ( Fig . 4c , d ; Fig . S5j - l ) and after 260 this fusion event , the electron - dense streak also diffuses , leav - 261 ing a hairpin - shaped membrane ( Fig . 4e , Fig . S6a - b ) . This 262 hairpin - shaped membrane then constricts and buds off just 263 anterior to the post - acrosomal sheath ( Fig . 4e , arrowhead ) , 264 yielding the characteristic morphology of acrosome - reacted 265 cells ( Fig . 4f , Fig . S6c ) . 266 Acrosomal exocytosis transforms the molecular land - 267 scape of the sperm plasma membrane . After loss of the 268 acrosome , the inner acrosomal membrane ( IAM ) is the new 269 limiting membrane of the apical segment of the sperm cell 270 ( Fig . 1e ) . The PM overlying the equatorial / post - acrosomal 271 segment remains intact and is now continuous with the IAM 272 ( Fig . 5 ) . Segmentation of high - contrast tomograms acquired 273 with a VPP revealed that the PM forms a “sheath” around 274 the post - acrosomal region ( Fig . 5d , Fig . S6 ) . Our tomo - 275 grams also showed tubulovesicular projections overlying the 276 equatorial segment ( Fig . 5d , Fig . S6 ) . These tubular mem - 277 branes are consistent with those observed by freeze - fracture 278 EM ( Aguas and da Silva , 1989 ) . Thus , the acrosome reaction 279 remodels the overall topography of the sperm surface . 280 We then compared the post - acrosomal segment in naïve 281 versus acrosome - reacted sperm ( Fig . 5b , e ; Fig . S7 ) . In - 282 specting the PM overlying the post - acrosomal sheath reveals 283 major differences in protein decoration . In unreacted cells , 284 the post - acrosomal PM is relatively smooth , with only a few 285 small protein densities protruding from the membrane ( Fig . 286 5b , Fig . S7a - c ) ( 14 / 14 tomograms , each from a different cell , 287 from 6 different animals ) . In contrast , the post - acrosomal 288 PM was densely packed with membrane protein densities in 289 ~ 80 % of tomograms of acrosome - reacted cells ( 30 / 37 tomo - 290 grams , each from a different cell , from 5 different animals ) 291 ( Fig . 5e , g ; Fig . S7d - f ) . These densities do not appear to be 292 ordered , which suggests that they represent a range of differ - 293 ent conformations , proteins , or protein complexes . Thus , the 294 acrosome reaction results in massive membrane protein re - 295 localization that alters the molecular landscape of the sperm 296 surface . 297 We then used subtomogram averaging to deﬁne the sub - 298 structure of the post - acrosomal sheath in more detail ( Fig . 299 5c , f ) . The peripheral layer of the post - acrosomal sheath , 300 immediately underlying the PM , consists of a multi - layered 301 structure with an ~ 8 - nm repeating unit . Our averages reveal 302 that neither the substructure nor the overall organization of 303 the post - acrosomal sheath change noticeably after acrosomal 304 exocytosis , which is consistent with measurements directly 305 from tomograms ( Fig . 5h ) . Similarly , the distance between 306 the PM and the post - acrosomal sheath remains relatively un - 307 changed ( unreacted : 15 ± 2 nm , reacted : 18 ± 3 nm ) . 308 Discussion 309 Gradual disassembly of the crystalline matrix may rep - 310 resent a mechanism for controlled release of acro - 311 some contents . Leading up to and during acrosomal exocy - 312 tosis , acrosome contents disperse at rates dependent on their 313 partitioning into either soluble or particulate fractions . The 314 particulate fraction , also known as the acrosomal matrix , dis - 315 perses gradually in a process dependent on alkalization and 316 proteolytic self - digestion ( Buffone et al . , 2008 ) . However , 317 we do not understand the underlying structural transitions in 318 the acrosomal matrix that regulate the dispersal of acroso - 319 mal contents . Studies of acrosomal matrix dispersal are often 320 performed on guinea pig sperm , which have large acrosomes 321 partitioned into subdomains easily visible by transmission 322 EM ( Flaherty and Olson , 1988 ; Hardy et al . , 1991 ; Kim et 323 al . , 2001 ; Olson and Winfrey , 1994 ) . Here , we use cryo - ET 324 to show that the acrosome is structurally compartmentalized 325 also in boar sperm ( Fig . 1 ) , which have comparatively thin 326 acrosomes and no obvious subdomains when viewed by con - 327 ventional EM ( Buffone et al . , 2008 ) . 328 Speciﬁcally , we ﬁnd an extensive crystalline fraction in 329 the boar sperm acrosome . Although crystalline structures 330 have been demonstrated previously in acrosomes of other 331 mammals , they were not followed throughout capacitation 332 and acrosomal exocytosis . Our data now show that the 333 crystalline fraction begins to disassemble during capacitation 334 ( Fig . 1d ) and continues to do so during acrosomal exocyto - 335 sis , resulting in small patches scattered amongst the vesicles 336 of the acrosomal shroud ( Fig . 1e , f ) . Gradual disassembly 337 of the crystalline matrix thus represents a plausible mecha - 338 nism for controlled release of acrosome contents . Reﬁning 339 this model will require further studies aimed at determining 340 the nature of the crystalline fraction – for instance , whether 341 it represents a scaffolding structure or a storage phase for in - 342 active enzymes . The subtomogram averages we present here 343 ( Fig . 2 ) can help towards this goal by providing constraints 344 on the molecular dimensions of candidate proteins . 345 Cryo - ET reveals how capacitation - associated mem - 346 brane destabilization relates to the membrane ﬁs - 347 sion - fusion processes involved in acrosomal exocy - 348 tosis . Our observations suggest that acrosome swelling re - 349 lates directly to membrane destabilization ( Fig . 3 ) , which is 350 likely caused by an increase in membrane tension in addi - 351 tion to known changes in membrane composition mediated 352 by cholesterol efﬂux and phospholipase activation ( Aitken 353 and Nixon , 2013 ; Asano et al . , 2013 ) . A role for swelling - 354 dependent membrane destabilization is also supported by ob - 355 servations that hyper - osmotic conditions inhibit the acrosome 356 reaction ( Bielfeld et al . , 1993 ) and that lysophosphatidyl - 357 choline , a positive curvature amphiphile that reduces the 358 energetic barrier for membrane rupture ( Glushakova et al . , 359 2005 ) , promotes the reaction ( de Lamirande et al . , 1997 ; Par - 360 rish et al . , 1988 ) . Meanwhile , the equatorial region is stabi - 361 lized by the electron - dense core of the acrosome ( Fig . 3d - 362 f ) and the post - acrosomal region likewise stabilized by the 363 post - acrosomal sheath . Thus , the precise organization of the 364 6 | Leung et al . | cryo - electron tomography of acrosomal exocytosis Fig . 4 .

This may be particularly rel - 376 evant given that one of the molecular signatures of capacita - 377 tion is cholesterol efﬂux . 378 Acrosomal exocytosis transforms the molecular land - 379 scape of the sperm plasma membrane . Acrosomal exo - 380 cytosis is an absolute requirement for mammalian sperm to 381 fuse with the egg ( Yanagimachi , 1981 ) . Fluorescence mi - 382 croscopy has shown that as a result of the acrosome reac - 383 tion , Izumo1 re - localizes onto the plasma membrane , allow - 384 ing it to interact with its oocyte - borne partner , Juno , to medi - 385 ate sperm - egg adhesion ( Satouh et al . , 2012 ) . However , the 386 Izumo1 - Juno interaction is not sufﬁcient to mediate mem - 387 brane fusion ( Bianchi et al . , 2014 ) . Our understanding of 388 sperm - egg fusion is hampered by the fact that , beyond the 389 translocation of Izumo1 , we know very little about what hap - 390 pens to the molecular landscape of the sperm surface after the 391 acrosome reaction . 392 Here , we show that acrosomal exocytosis transforms both 393 the micron - scale topography and the molecular landscape of 394 the sperm surface ( Fig . 5 ) . We ﬁnd that the post - acrosomal 395 plasma membrane becomes heavily decorated with mem - 396 brane protein densities . Such changes may be due to the 397 re - localization of membrane proteins , similar to the phe - 398 nomenon observed by freeze - fracture EM for the acrosomal 399 cap region ( Aguas and da Silva , 1989 ) , or to the binding of 400 liberated acrosomal proteins to pre - existing receptors . The 401 post - acrosomal membrane protein densities do not appear to 402 be ordered , which suggests that they represent a range of dif - 403 ferent conformations , proteins , or protein complexes . Indeed , 404 in addition to Izumo1 , there are now a number of proteins on 405 mammalian sperm that are known to be essential for sperm - 406 egg binding and fusion ( Fujihara et al . , 2020 ; Inoue et al . , 407 2005 ; Lamas - Toranzo et al . , 2020 ; Noda et al . , 2020 ) . Our 408 results therefore complement the emerging view that mam - 409 malian sperm - egg fusion involves several molecular species 410 acting in concert . Our work also opens avenues for future 411 Leung et al . | cryo - electron tomography of acrosomal exocytosis 7 Fig . 5 .

Freshly - ejaculated pig ( Sus scrofa domestica ) semen 437 was purchased from an artiﬁcial insemination company 438 ( AIM Varkens KI Nederland ) . Semen was typically di - 439 luted in Beltsville’s thawing solution ( BTS : 205 mM glucose , 440 20 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 15 mM NaHCO 3 , 3 mM EDTA ) 441 and stored at 18 ◦ C until use . Sperm were used within 1 day 442 of delivery . Sperm were gently layered onto a discontin - 443 uous gradient consisting of 2 mL of 70 % Percoll overlaid 444 with 4 mL of 30 % Percoll , both in HEPES - buffered saline 445 ( HBS : 20 mM HEPES , 137 mM NaCl , 10 mM glucose , 446 2 . 5 mM KCl , 0 . 1 % kanamycin , pH 7 . 6 ) and centrifuged 447 at 750 g for 15 min . Pelleted cells were washed once in 448 phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS : 137 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 449 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) , resuspended in 450 PBS , and counted . 451 Washed sperm were resuspended in 1X TALP 452 ( 20 mM HEPES , 90 mM NaCl , 21 . 7 mM sodium lac - 453 tate , 15 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM glucose , 3 . 1 mM KCl , 454 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 0 . 4 mM MgSO 4 , 455 0 . 3 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 100 µg / mL kanamycin , 0 . 3 % w / v fatty 456 acid - free BSA ( Sigma ) , pH 7 . 4 ) at ~ 10 - 20 x 10 6 cells / mL . 457 Sperm were allowed to capacitate for between 2 and 2 . 5 458 hours at 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 . In order to stimulate the acrosome 459 reaction more rapidly and in a larger percentage of cells , 460 either calcium ionophore A23187 ( Sigma ) or progesterone 461 ( Sigma ) was added to capacitated cells to a ﬁnal concen - 462 tration of either 5 µM or 3 µM , respectively . Cells were 463 incubated for a further 30 min ( for ionophore ) or 1 h ( for 464 progesterone ) at 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 . 465 For ﬂow cytometry , cells were ﬁrst washed with PBS 466 and their concentration adjusted to 30 - 50 x 10 6 cells / mL . 467 Sperm were then stained with propidium iodide ( PI ) 468 ( LifeTechnologies ) and with PNA - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate 469 ( FITC ) ( Sigma ) , both at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 µg / mL . 470 Sperm were then diluted 1 / 100 to 0 . 5 x 10 6 cells / mL and 471 analyzed using a BD FACSCanto II ﬂow cytometer . Viable , 472 acrosome - reacted cells were deﬁned as those in the PI + FITC + 473 quadrant of the cytogram . 474 Cryo - EM grid preparation . Typically , 3 µL of a suspen - 475 sion containing either 2 - 3 x 10 6 cells / mL ( for whole cell to - 476 mography ) or 20 - 30 x 10 6 cells / mL ( for cryo - FIB milling ) 477 was pipetted onto a glow - discharged Quantifoil R 2 / 1 200 - 478 mesh holey carbon grid . One µL of a suspension of BSA - 479 conjugated gold beads ( Aurion ) was added , and the grids then 480 blotted manually from the back ( opposite the side of cell de - 481 position ) for ~ 3 s ( for whole cell tomography ) or for ~ 5 - 6 s 482 ( for cryo - FIB milling ) using a manual plunge - freezer ( MPI 483 Martinsreid ) . Grids were immediately plunged into a liquid 484 ethane - propane mix ( 37 % ethane ) ( Tivol et al . , 2008 ) cooled 485 to liquid nitrogen temperature . Grids were stored under liq - 486 uid nitrogen until imaging . 487 Cryo - focused ion beam milling . Grids were mounted into 488 modiﬁed Autogrids ( ThermoFisher ) for mechanical support . 489 Clipped grids were loaded into an Aquilos ( ThermoFisher ) 490 dual - beam cryo - focused ion beam / scanning electron micro - 491 scope ( cryo - FIB / SEM ) . All SEM imaging was performed at 492 2 kV and 13 pA , whereas FIB imaging for targeting was per - 493 formed at 30 kV and 10 pA . Milling was typically performed 494 with a stage tilt of 18° , so lamellae were inclined 11° rela - 495 tive to the grid . Each lamella was milled in four stages : an 496 initial rough mill at 1 nA beam current , an intermediate mill 497 at 300 pA , a ﬁne mill at 100 pA , and a polishing step at 30 498 pA . Lamellae were milled with the wedge pre - milling tech - 499 nique described in ( Schaffer et al . , 2017 ) and with expansion 500 segments as described in ( Wolff et al . , 2019 ) . 501 Tilt series acquisition . Tilt series were acquired on ei - 502 ther a Talos Arctica ( ThermoFisher ) operating at 200 kV 503 or a Titan Krios ( ThermoFisher ) operating at 300 kV , both 504 equipped with a post - column energy ﬁlter ( Gatan ) in zero - 505 loss imaging mode with a 20 - eV energy - selecting slit . All 506 images were recorded on a K2 Summit direct electron detec - 507 tor ( Gatan ) in either counting or super - resolution mode with 508 dose - fractionation . Tilt series were collected using SerialEM 509 ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) at a target defocus of between - 4 and - 6 510 µm ( conventional defocus - contrast ) or between - 0 . 5 and - 1 . 5 511 µm ( for tilt series acquired with the Volta phase plate ) . Tilt 512 series were typically recorded using either strict or grouped 513 dose - symmetric schemes , either spanning ± 56° in 2° incre - 514 ments or ± 54° in 3° increments , with total dose limited to 515 ~ 100 e - / Å 2 . 516 Leung et al . | cryo - electron tomography of acrosomal exocytosis 9 Tomogram reconstruction . Frames were aligned either 517 post - acquisition using Motioncor2 1 . 2 . 1 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) 518 or on - the - ﬂy using Warp ( Tegunov and Cramer , 2019 ) . 519 Frames were usually collected in counting mode ; when 520 super - resolution frames were used , they were binned 2X dur - 521 ing motion correction . Tomograms were reconstructed in 522 IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) using weighted back - projection , 523 with a SIRT - like ﬁlter ( Zeng , 2012 ) applied for visualization 524 and segmentation . Defocus - contrast tomograms were CTF - 525 corrected in IMOD using ctfphaseﬂip while VPP tomograms 526 were left uncorrected . 527 Tomogram segmentation . Tomogram segmentation was 528 generally performed semi - automatically . Initial segmenta - 529 tion was performed using the neural network - based TomoSeg 530 package in EMAN 2 . 21 . Segmentation was then reﬁned man - 531 ually in either Avizo 9 . 2 . 0 ( FEI ) or Chimera 1 . 12 . Membrane 532 distance measurements were performed using built - in func - 533 tions in Avizo 9 . 2 . 0 . 534 Subtomogram averaging of crystalloid patches . Subto - 535 mogram averaging with missing wedge compensation was 536 performed using PEET 1 . 13 . 0 ( Heumann et al . , 2011 ; Nicas - 537 tro et al . , 2006 ) . Alignments were performed ﬁrst on 4x - 538 binned defocus - contrast tomograms , after which aligned po - 539 sitions and orientations were transferred to 2x - binned data 540 using scripts shared by Dr . Daven Vasishtan . 541 Particle positions were seeded by generating a three - 542 dimensional grid of points in crystalloid patches using the 543 gridInit program . All particle orientations were randomized 544 and initial alignments allowed for full rotational searches 545 around all axes . To ensure consistency , two independent 546 initial alignments were performed , each using a randomly - 547 selected particle from a separate tomogram as an initial ref - 548 erence . Since alignments converged on a similar structure , 549 alignments were continued . The dataset was cleaned by 550 ( i ) removing all particles with a cross - correlation value less 551 than one standard deviation above the mean ( which removed 552 poorly - aligning particles such as those at the edges of crystal - 553 loid patches ) and by ( ii ) removing overlapping particles . The 554 orientations of the remaining particles were again random - 555 ized and another alignment performed . After a ﬁnal parti - 556 cle clean - up by classiﬁcation , a ﬁnal restricted alignment run 557 was performed . Averages presented in the manuscript were 558 ﬁltered to the estimated resolution based on the Fourier shell 559 correlation ( FSC ) at a cut - off of 0 . 5 ( Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) . 560 Measurements and quantiﬁcation . All measurements 561 were performed on ~ 20 - nm thick central tomographic slices . 562 Acrosomal width was measured manually in IMOD as the 563 distance between the outer and inner acrosomal membranes . 564 For each tomogram , three measurements were recorded at 565 different locations to account for slight variations in the shape 566 of the acrosome . Linescans for measurement of the post - 567 acrosomal sheath were performed in Fiji v 2 . 0 . 0 - rc - 69 / 1 . 52p . 568 Data availability .
