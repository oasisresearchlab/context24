This study examined the inhibition mechanism and profile of actions of Y - 27632 and a related compound , Y - 30141 [ ( 1 ) - ( R ) - trans - 4 - ( 1 - aminoethyl ) - N - ( 1H - pyrrolo [ 2 , 3 - b ] pyridin - 4 - yl ) cyclohexan - ecarboxamide dihydrochloride ] . Y - 27632 and Y - 30141 inhib - ited the kinase activity of both ROCK - I and ROCK - II in vitro , and this inhibition was reversed by ATP in a competitive man - ner . This suggests that these compounds inhibit the kinases by binding to the catalytic site . Their affinities for ROCK kinases as determined by K i values were at least 20 to 30 times higher than those for two other Rho effector kinases , citron kinase and protein kinase PKN . [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 was taken up by cells in a temperature - and time - dependent and saturable manner , and this uptake was competed with unlabeled Y - 27632 . No con - centrated accumulation was found , suggesting that the uptake is a carrier - mediated facilitated diffusion . Y - 27632 abolished stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells at 10 m M , but the G 1 - S phase transition of the cell cycle and cytokinesis were little affected at this concentration . Y - 30141 was 10 times more potent than Y - 27632 in inhibiting the kinase activity and stress fiber forma - tion , and it caused significant delay in the G 1 - S transition and inhibition of cytokinesis at 10 m M . The Ras - related small GTPase Rho functions as a molecu - lar switch of various cellular processes by shuttling between the inactive , GDP - bound form and the active , GTP - bound form . Cellular actions of Rho have been studied by two ways . One is to express or microinject the active GTP - bound form of the protein in the cells and identify the phenotype of Rho activation . The other is to treat cells with botulinum C3 exoenzyme that specifically ADP - ribosylates and inactivates endogenous Rho and thereby identify the phenotype of Rho inactivation . Studies using either or both of these approaches have identified various cellular actions of Rho . They include regulation of stimulus - induced cell - to - substrate adhesion and motility , neurite retraction , cytokinesis , calcium sensiti - zation of smooth muscle contraction , the G 1 - S progression of the cell cycle , cell transformation , and nuclear transcription by serum response factor [ reviewed in Narumiya ( 1996 ) ] . The cell - to - substrate adhesion is seen in cultured fibroblasts and epithelial cells as induction of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions . Thus , Rho has a variety of actions , each being critical in the respective process . It may be therapeutically useful if these Rho actions can be selectively manipulated by pharmacological means . Rho acts on downstream effectors to exert the above ac - tions . Several proteins have been isolated as putative Rho effectors on the basis of their selective interaction with the GTP - bound form of Rho . These include the Rho - associated coiled - coil forming protein serine / threonine kinase ( ROCK ) family comprised of p160ROCK ( ROCK - I ) ( Ishizaki et al . , 1996 ) and ROK a / Rho - kinase / ROCK - II ( Leung et al . , 1995 ; Matsui et al . , 1996 ; Nakagawa et al . , 1996 ) , protein kinase PKN ( Amano et al . , 1996 ; Watanabe et al . , 1996 ) , citron and citron kinase ( Madaule et al . , 1995 , 1998 ) , and mammalian diaphanous homologs , mDia 1 and mDia 2 ( Watanabe et al . , 1997 ; Alberts et al . , 1998 ) . Among them , the ROCK family of kinases has been shown to be involved in Rho - induced for - mation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions ( Leung et al . , 1996 ; Amano et al . , 1997 ; Ishizaki et al . , 1997 ) and in down - This work was supported in part by Grants - in - Aid for Specially Promoted Research ( 08102007 ) and for Scientific Research ( C ) ( 2 ) ( 10670120 ) from the Ministry of Education , Science , and Culture of Japan , and grants from Searle Fellowship , the Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology , the Tanabe Med - ical Frontier Conference , and the Human Frontier Science Program .

We recently reported a new synthetic compound named Y - 27632 [ ( 1 ) - ( R ) - trans - 4 - ( 1 - aminoethyl ) - N - ( 4 - pyridyl ) cyclohexanecar - boxamide dihydrochloride ] as a specific inhibitor of the ROCK family of kinases ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . This compound inhibits agonist - induced contraction of vascular as well as bronchial smooth muscles through the inhibition of the cal - cium sensitization mechanism of smooth muscle contraction . The photoaffinity labeling using a 125 I - labeled analog of Y - 27632 identified the target protein of this compound as ROCK - I , and the initial characterization revealed that Y - 27632 inhibits the ROCK family of kinases 100 times more potently than other kinases including protein kinase C , cAMP - dependent kinase and myosin light chain kinase . Since this report , Y - 27632 has been widely used as a ROCK inhibitor to identify and evaluate the involvement and roles of ROCK kinases in a variety of systems , including platelet activation ( Klages et al . , 1999 ) , aortic smooth muscle contrac - tion by various stimuli ( Fu et al . , 1998 ) , thrombin - induced responses of aortic smooth muscle cells ( Seasholtz et al . , 1999 ) , hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes ( Kuwahara et al . , 1999 ) , bronchial smooth muscle contraction ( Yoshii et al . , 1999 ) , activation of volume - regulated anion channels ( Nilius et al . , 1999 ) , neurite retraction ( Hirose et al . , 1998 ) , neutro - phil chemotaxis ( Niggli , 1999 ) , wound healing ( Nobes and Hall , 1999 ) , tumor invasion ( Itoh et al . , 1999 ) , and cell trans - formation ( Sahai et al . , 1999 ) . However , the mechanisms of kinase inhibition and cell permeation of Y - 27632 as well as the selectivity of Y - 27632 among various Rho - mediated cel - lular actions have not yet been fully addressed . Information regarding these issues will be useful in interpreting the find - ings obtained by the use of this compound . In this study , using Y - 27632 and a related compound , Y - 30141 [ ( 1 ) - ( R ) - trans - 4 - ( 1 - aminoethyl ) - N - ( 1H - pyrrolo [ 2 , 3 - b ] pyridin - 4 - yl ) cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride ] , we have examined the kinetics of their kinase inhibition and cellular uptake , and compared their actions on three Rho - mediated cellular events , stress fiber formation , the G 1 - S phase progression of the cell cycle , and cytokinesis . Experimental Procedures Materials . Y - 27632 and Y - 30141 , hereafter referred collectively as the “Y - compounds , ” were synthesized as described in USP 4997834 and USP 5478838 , respectively . They were dissolved in water and stored . These compounds are stable in an aqueous solu - tion at room temperature for at least 4 weeks . Nocodazole and bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) were purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . Thymidine , anti - BrdU antibody , and human recombinant pro - tein kinase C a ( PKC a ) were purchased from Kohjin Co . Ltd . ( Tokyo , Japan ) , Becton Dickinson ( San Jose , CA ) , and Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) , respectively . [ g - 32 P ] ATP ( 3000 Ci / mmol ) was purchased from DuPont New England Nuclear ( Boston , MA ) . [ pyrro - 4 - 3 H ] Y - 30141 ( 17 . 1 Ci / mmol ) was synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech by catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding aryl bromide with tritium gas by the use of 10 % paradium on carbon . It was delivered in 50 % ethanol solution and stored at 2 20°C for 1 year before this experiment . Because it decomposed spontaneously during storage , we purified [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 by a two - step extraction procedure before use . Briefly , the aqueous solution of [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 was diluted with an equal volume of water , alkalized to pH 9 . 0 with ammonia water , and extracted with one volume of ethyl acetate . The ethyl acetate phase was saved and then extracted with one volume of diluted acetic acid at pH 4 . 0 . [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 , first extracted into the organic phase , was extracted back to the aqueous solution by the second procedure . The purity of Y - 30141 was examined by silica gel thin - layer chromatography using Kieselgel - 60 ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) with a solvent system of methanol / water / 28 % ammonia water ( 10 : 1 : 1 ) . A single radioactive band comigrated with authentic Y - 30141 at an R F value of 0 . 59 . Kinase Assay . Recombinant ROCK - I , ROCK - II , PKN , or citron kinase was expressed in HeLa cells as Myc - tagged proteins by trans - fection using Lipofectamine , and was precipitated from the cell ly - sates by the use of 9E10 monoclonal anti - Myc antibody coupled to G protein - Sepharose ( Ishizaki et al . , 1997 ) . Recovered immunocom - plexes were incubated with various concentrations of [ 32 P ] ATP and 10 m g of histone type 2 as substrates in the absence or presence of various concentrations of either Y - 27632 or Y - 30141 at 30°C for 30 min in a total volume of 30 m l of the kinase buffer containing 50 mM HEPES - NaOH , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM MnCl 2 , 0 . 02 % Briji 35 , and 2 mM dithiothreitol . PKC a was incubated with 5 m M [ 32 P ] ATP and 200 m g / ml histone type 2 as substrates in the absence or pres - ence of various concentrations of either Y - 27632 or Y - 30141 at 30°C for 10 min in a kinase buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM magnesium acetate , 25 m g / ml phosphatidyl serine , 50 ng / ml 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate and 0 . 001 % leupep - tin in a total volume of 30 m l . Incubation was terminated by the addition of 10 m l of 4 3 Laemmli sample buffer . After boiling for 5 min , the mixture was subjected to SDS - polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis on a 16 % gel . The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue , and then dried . The bands corresponding to histone type 2 were excised , and the radioactivity was measured . K i values were either determined by the double reciprocal plot or calculated from an equa - tion of K i 5 IC 50 / ( 1 1 S / Km ) , where S and K m are the concentration of ATP and the K m value for ATP , respectively . Cellular Uptake of Y - 30141 . HeLa cells and Swiss 3T3 cells were plated on a 24 - well dish at a density of 2 3 10 4 cells / well and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) for 1 day . Rat platelets were prepared from rat platelet - rich plasma , and suspended in DMEM . Rat lym - phocytes were prepared from the spleen . After contaminated red blood cells were lysed by the treatment of Tris - NH 4 Cl buffer , they were suspended in DMEM . For the time course experiments , cells were incubated with 1 m M [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 ( 0 . 4 m Ci / well ) at either 4°C or 37°C for indicated times in 0 . 5 ml of DMEM . For the saturation kinetics , Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated with various concentrations of [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 ( 0 . 4 m Ci / well ) at 37°C for 10 min in 0 . 5 ml of DMEM . After incubation , the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and lysed with 0 . 2 ml of 1 N NaOH . The radioactivity in the lysates was determined in an ACS - II liquid scintillator ( Amersharm Pharmacia Biotech ) . To determine an intracellular Y - 30141 concentration , Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated with 1 m M [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 at 37°C for 30 min , and the cellular uptake by this culture was determined as described above . Cells in parallel cultures were dissociated by trypsin treat - ment , and the viable cell number was determined using the trypan blue dye exclusion method . For determination of a cell volume , 3 3 10 5 viable cells were suspended in 1 ml and an aliquot of the sus - pension was aspirated into a micro - hematocrit capillary tube ( Becton Dickinson ) . The tube was then centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min , and a packed cell volume was determined . Effect of Y - Compounds on Cell Morphology . Swiss 3T3 cells were plated on a coverglass at a density of 2 3 10 4 cells per 3 . 5 - cm dish and cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS . After 1 day , various concentrations of Y - 27632 or Y - 30141 or vehicle were added to the culture and the cells were cultured for either 30 min or 24 h . Alternatively , after culture in serum - containing DMEM for 1 day , the cells were cultured in 2 . 7 ml of DMEM without serum for 24 h . Various concentrations of Y - 27632 or Y - 30141 were then added , and the cells were incubated for additional 30 min . Lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) was then added at 5 m M concentration , and the cells were incubated for indicated times in the continued presence or absence of Pharmacological Properties of Y - 27632 , a ROCK Inhibitor 977 b y gue s t on O c t obe r 9 , 2011 m o l pha r m . a s pe t j ou r na l s . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m the Y - compounds . Fixation , permeabilization , blocking , and immu - nofluorescence were performed as described previously ( Ishizaki et al . , 1997 ) . For F - actin staining , Oregon green - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) was used . Cells were analyzed in 0 . 36 - m m optical sections using a Bio - Rad MRC - 1024 confocal imag - ing system , and built - up images were constructed . Effect of Y - Compounds on G 1 - S Transition . Swiss 3T3 cells were plated on a coverglass at a density of 3 3 10 4 cells per 3 . 5 - cm dish and cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS . After 1 day , the medium was changed to serum - free DMEM and the cells were fur - ther cultured for 36 h . The medium was removed , and the cells were incubated in fresh DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 10 m M BrdU in the presence or absence of various concentrations of Y - 27632 or 10 m M Y - 30141 for indicated times at 37°C in a CO 2 incubator . The cells were then fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS , without CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 , and stained for BrdU incorporated in the cell nucleus as described previously ( Olson et al . , 1995 ) . The number of BrdU - incorporated cells was counted in 300 cells per sample . Effect of Y - Compounds on Cytokinesis . HeLa cells were plated at a density of 3 3 10 4 cells per 3 . 5 - cm dish . The cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS in the presence of 10 mM thymidine for 16 h . After the cells were washed with DMEM con - taining 10 % FBS , they were cultured for an additional 8 h , and then 40 ng / ml of nocodazole was added . After 11 . 5 h of the nocodazole treatment , various concentrations of Y - 27632 , Y - 30141 , or vehicle was added and the cells were incubated for another 30 min . The mitotic round cells were then collected by repeated pipeting , washed three times with DMEM containing 10 % FBS with or without the Y - compounds , and replated onto a coverglass . The cells were cul - tured fo r 4 h inDMEM containing 10 % FBS in the continued absence or presence of the Y - compounds and then fixed . Cell nuclei were stained with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole as described previously ( Madaule et al . , 1998 ) . The number of multinucleated cells were counted in at least 100 cells . Results Inhibition of ROCK Kinases by Y - Compounds . Myc - tagged ROCK - I precipitated from lysates of HeLa cells over - expressing this kinase was incubated with 330 m g of pro - tein / ml of histone type 2 and 1 m M ATP at 30°C . Recombinant ROCK - I phosphorylated histone as previously reported ( Ish - izaki et al . , 1996 ) ; under the standard assay conditions , the phosphorylation proceeded linearly for 45 min and occurred in a manner dependent on the amount of the enzyme in the reaction ( Fig . 1A ) . Recombinant ROCK - I was then incubated with various concentrations of ATP at 37°C for 30 min , and the enzyme kinetics was analyzed . This analysis revealed the Michaelis - Menten kinetics for this reaction , and the K m value for ATP was calculated to be 0 . 15 m M by the double reciprocal plot of the reaction ( Fig . 1B ) . To elucidate the inhibition mechanism of Y - 27632 , the reaction was further performed in the presence of 0 . 3 and 1 m M Y - 27632 . As shown in Fig . 1B , the addition of Y - 27632 increased the apparent K m values for ATP of ROCK - I in a concentration - dependent manner without any change in the V max value . These findings suggest that Y - 27632 inhibited ROCK - I by competing with ATP for its binding to the kinase . Similar results were obtained with ROCK - II ( data not shown ) , and the K i values of Y - 27632 were estimated to be 0 . 22 and 0 . 30 m M for ROCK - I and ROCK - II , respectively ( Table 1 ) . A re - lated compound , Y - 30141 , acts similarly on ROCK kinases ( Fig . 1C ) with about 10 times higher affinities , the K i values being 0 . 03 m M for ROCK - I and 0 . 05 m M for ROCK - II ( Table 1 ) . Selectivity of inhibition by Y - compounds was then exam - ined by comparing their K i values for two other Rho effector kinases , citron kinase and PKN , as well as PKC a . The K i values of the Y - compounds for citron kinase and PKN were at least 20 times higher , and the K i values for PKC a were about 200 times higher than those for ROCK kinases ( Table 1 ) . Cellular Uptake of Y - 30141 . Y - compounds , added at mi - cromolar concentrations outside tissues and cells , could po - tently inhibit various ROCK - mediated processes , including agonist - induced smooth muscle contraction [ see for example , Fig . 1 .

Structures of the Y - compounds are shown in B and C . Typical results of four to five experiments are shown . 978 Ishizaki et al . b y gue s t on O c t obe r 9 , 2011 m o l pha r m . a s pe t j ou r na l s . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Uehata et al . ( 1997 ) and Hirose et al . ( 1998 ) ] . To elucidate the cell permeation mechanism of these compounds , we incu - bated cells with [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 and examined the incorporation of the radioactivity into the cells . As shown in Fig . 2A , [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 was incorporated by Swiss 3T3 cells in a time - depen - dent manner . This incorporated radioactivity reached a pla - teau by 30 min of incubation and was not reduced by the addition of an excess amount of cold Y - 30141 at the plateau phase , indicating that the cell - associated radioactivity repre - sented the uptake into the cells and not the binding to the cell surface . This uptake occurred in a temperature - dependent manner ; only negligible uptake was found at 4°C . A similar extent of uptake occurred when Swiss 3T3 cells were incu - bated with [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 in either DMEM or PBS alone or DMEM containing 10 % FBS . Similar time - and temperature - dependent uptake was observed in rat blood platelets , rat lymphocytes , and HeLa cells ( data not shown ) . To character - ize this uptake mechanism , we next incubated Swiss 3T3 cells with various concentrations of [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 and exam - ined the saturation kinetics . As shown in Fig . 2B , the uptake increased hyperbolically with increasing concentrations of Y - 30141 , and the K m value of Y - 30141 was estimated to be 3 mM from the analysis using a double reciprocal plot . The addition of Y - 27632 reduced the [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 incorporation in a concentration - dependent manner ; at 10 mM about 50 % reduction was observed ( Fig . 2C ) . A similar concentration - dependent inhibition curve was obtained with cold Y - 30141 ( data not shown ) , indicating that Y - 30141 and Y - 27632 have similar affinities for the uptake . To see if this uptake can concentrate the Y - compounds in the cells , we determined the intracellular concentration of [ 3 H ] Y - 30141 from the incorpo - rated radioactivity and the packed cell volume . The intracel - lular concentration of Y - 30141 was estimated to be 1 to 2 m M , when the cells were incubated with 1 m M Y - 30141 for 30 min . Effects of Y - Compounds on Cell Morphology of Swiss 3T3 Cells . We previously showed that Y - 27632 abolished stress fibers induced in HeLa cells by expression of an active Rho mutant , Val 14 - Rho , but not membrane ruffles induced by an active Rac mutant , Val 12 - Rac ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . We now examined the effects of Y - compounds on LPA - induced stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells . Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in serum - free medium and stimulated with LPA in the ab - sence or presence of various concentrations of Y - 27632 or Y - 30141 . The cells were then stained for actin . Swiss 3T3 cells became thin in serum - free medium , and showed disor - ganized F - actin structures in the cells . On stimulation with LPA , they resumed extended cell shape and induced actin stress fibers . Prior treatment of cells with Y - compounds for 30 min prevented these changes in a concentration - depen - dent manner ; almost complete inhibition was observed at 10 m M Y - 27632 and 1 m M Y - 30141 ( Fig . 3 , A – F ) . We next added these compounds to Swiss 3T3 cells cultured in serum - con - taining medium , and asked whether the Y - compounds caused morphological changes . Two types of changes were TABLE 1 K i values of Y - 27632 and Y - 30141 for Rho effector kinases and PKC a Protein Kinase K m for ATP K i Y - 27632 Y - 30141 m M m M ROCK - I 0 . 15 / 0 . 15 a 0 . 22 0 . 03 ROCK - II 0 . 25 / 0 . 29 a 0 . 30 0 . 05 Citron kinase 0 . 12 / 0 . 24 a 5 . 3 1 . 1 PKN 0 . 17 / 0 . 08 a 3 . 1 1 . 4 PKC a 6 . 1 73 b 6 . 0 b PKA c 13 25 0 . 3 MLCK c 50 . 250 14 a K i values for Y - 27632 and Y - 30141 were calculated from the Linewaver - Burk analysis based on two series of competition experiments , and the K m values of various kinases for ATP were determined in each experiments , one for competition with Y - 27632 and the other for competition with Y - 30141 , are shown at the left and the right of the slash , respectively . b Calculated from IC 50 values . c Cited from Uehata et al .

The former phenotype was seen within 30 min after the addition of both Y - compounds ( Fig . 4 , C and E ) . The latter became striking on longer incubation with Y - 27632 ( Fig . 4D ) , whereas the cells treated with 1 m M Y - 30141 showed long spikes already on 30 - min incubation ( Fig . 4E ) . These changes were produced in a concentration - dependent manner ; stress fibers almost disappeared in 30 min on incubation with 10 m M Y - 27632 and with 1 m M Y - 30141 . This ratio of the poten - cies of the Y - compounds is identical with that of their inhib - itory activities for ROCK kinases in vitro . After 24 h of treatment , thin F - actin bundles reappeared in the treated cells , but the effects on the cell shape continued to be ob - served ( Fig . 4 , D and F ) . The resumed F - actin bundles were abolished by treating the cells with freshly prepared Y - com - pounds ( data not shown ) . Effects of Y - Compounds on the Cell Cycle Progres - sion from the G 1 - S Phase of Swiss 3T3 Cells . The involve - ment of Rho in the G 1 - S phase progression of the cell cycle has been well documented ( Yamamoto et al . , 1993 ; Olson et al . , 1995 ; Hirai et al . , 1997 ; Olson et al . , 1998 ) . However , the downstream member of Rho effectors mediating this process remains unknown . Using the Y - compounds , we examined whether ROCK is involved in the G 1 - S progression . Swiss 3T3 cells were enriched in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation . The cells were then cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and BrdU . In control culture without the Y - compounds , BrdU - positive cells were detected at 12 h after serum addition , increased time - dependently , and al - most all cells were labeled by 24 h . Y - 27632 prolonged the lag time and delayed the appearance of BrdU - labeled cells in a concentration - dependent manner , delays of about 1 and 4 h were noticed in the cells treated with 10 and 100 m M Y - 27632 , respectively ( Fig . 5 ) . However , all the cells were eventually labeled with BrdU by 31 h after serum addition . Y - 30141 was 10 times more potent in this action , causing a delay at 10 m M that was comparable with that found at 100 m M Y - 27632 . All the cells again progressed into the S phase by 31 h ( Fig . 5 ) . The potency ratio was identical with that of their ROCK inhibitory activities , although higher concentra - Fig . 3 . Effects of the Y - compounds on LPA - induced actin stress fibers . Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in serum - free medium for 24 h . Before LPA stimulation , the cells were incubated with either 1 ( C ) or 10 ( D ) m M Y - 27632 or 1 ( E ) or 10 ( F ) m M Y - 30141 . These cells were stimulated with either vehicle ( A ) or 5 m M LPA ( B , C , D , E , and F ) for 30 min at 37°C . The cells were then stained with Oregon green phalloidin . Bar , 50 m m . Fig . 4 .

Effects of Y - Compounds on Cytokinesis of M Phase - Enriched HeLa Cells . Experiments using C3 exoenzyme and / or Rho GDP - dissociation inhibitor revealed that Rho critically regulates cytokinesis by inducing and maintaining the contractile ring ( Kishi et al . , 1993 ; Mabuchi et al . , 1993 ; Drechsel et al . , 1997 ) . Involvement of Rho effectors such as mDia ( Watanabe et al . , 1997 ) , citron kinase ( Madaule et al . , 1998 ) and Rho - kinase ( Yasui et al . , 1998 ) in this process have been suggested . Using a specific antibody to ROCK - I ( Ish - izaki et al . , 1996 ) , we first determined the localization of endogenous ROCK during cytokinesis in HeLa cells by im - munofluorescence analysis . As shown in Fig . 6 , ROCK - I im - munoreactivity was distributed homogeneously in the cyto - plasm through G 1 to metaphase , but a part of the molecules appeared to be concentrated in the cleavage furrow in telo - phase , suggesting that ROCK is involved in cytokinesis . We then evaluated the involvement of ROCK in this process by using the Y - compounds . HeLa cells were subjected to thymi - dine block followed by nocodazole treatment . By this proce - dure about 60 % of the cells were enriched in the M phase . When these cells were released by washing free of nocoda - zole , about 80 % of the M phase - enriched cells underwent cytokinesis that completed in 4 h after the release . Y - 27632 added 30 min before the release inhibited cytokinesis in a concentration - dependent manner . However , inhibition was first detected at 30 m M Y - 27632 and became significant only at 100 m M ( Fig . 7 ) . Y - 30141 showed higher inhibitory po - tency ; inhibition appeared at 3 m M and became significant at 30 m M . Discussion In this study we have characterized the mechanisms of the kinase inhibition of Y - 27632 and a related compound Y - 30141 . We found that these compounds inhibit ROCK ki - nases by competing with ATP for binding to the kinases . This finding led us to speculate that the selectivity of these com - pounds as kinase inhibitors is derived from a difference in their K i values to various kinases . Indeed , experiments using different types of kinases in this study as well as in our previous study ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) showed that both Y - compounds showed much lower K i values to the ROCK family of kinases than to other kinases , including citron kinase , PKN , PKC , cAMP - dependent protein kinase , and myosin light chain kinase . We next investigated the cell permeation mechanism of these compounds , and found that they are taken up by cells by a carrier - mediated facilitated diffusion without concentration in the cell . This finding suggests that the extracellular concentration of the Y - compounds added outside tissues and cells are almost equivalent to their intra - cellular concentration to exert inhibition of biological re - sponses in the cell . The concentration - inhibition relationship of Y - 27632 was examined in several systems , including inhi - bition of phenylephrine - induced contraction of rabbit aorta ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) , inhibition of LPA - induced neurite re - Fig . 5 . Effects of the Y - compounds on G 1 - S progression in Swiss 3T3 cells . The cells were cultured for 36 h in serum - free medium , and then cultured in the medium containing 10 % FBS . Ten m M BrdU and various concen - trations of either Y - 27632 or 10 m M Y - 30141 were also added . The cells were fixed at indicated times and stained with anti - BrdU antibody . The numbers of BrdU - positive cells were counted under fluorescence micros - copy of 300 cells . The results of three independent experiments are shown . Fig . 6 . Localization of ROCK - I in the cleavage furrow in HeLa cells .

The cells were incubated with nocodazole for 11 . 5 h and then treated with various concentration of Y - 27632 ( M ) or Y - 30141 ( f ) for 30 min . The cells were washed free of nocodazole , resuspended in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and the Y - compounds , and cultured for 4 h . The number of cells showing cytokinesis failure was counted in 200 cells . The results of three inde - pendent experiments are shown as mean 6 S . E . Statistical significance of differences between the control and each treated group was determined by the Dunnett’s multiple comparison test . A difference was considered to be statistically significant when the P value was less than . 01 ( * P , . 01 ) . Pharmacological Properties of Y - 27632 , a ROCK Inhibitor 981 b y gue s t on O c t obe r 9 , 2011 m o l pha r m . a s pe t j ou r na l s . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m traction of N1E - 115 cells ( Hirose et al . , 1998 ) , inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation in neutrophils ( Niggli , 1999 ) , inhibition of bronchial smooth muscle contraction ( Yo - shii et al . , 1999 ) , and inhibition of agonist - induced secretory response in platelets ( Suzuki et al . , 1999 ) . In all cases , the inhibition was detected at 10 2 7 M and almost complete at 10 2 5 M . This is almost identical to the concentration - inhibi - tion relationship of Y - 27632 for inhibition of stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells in this study . These results suggest that Y - 27632 can exert specific effects at lower m M concentrations in the cells . This appears contradictory to the property of Y - 27632 as a competitive inhibitor for ATP described above , because it is generally accepted that ATP is present at mil - limolar concentrations in the cell [ see for example , Stryer ( 1995 ) and Traut ( 1994 ) ] . In that case , the competitive inhi - bition kinetics suggests that millimolar concentrations of the Y - compounds are required to inhibit the kinase activity of ROCK in situ in the cell . It is also difficult to imagine that the Y - compounds exert specific inhibition of ROCK kinases un - der these conditions , where the IC 50 value and not K i deter - mines the specificity , raising a possibility that Y - 27632 acts on another target to exert cellular effects . However , accumu - lating evidence strongly suggests that ROCK kinases are indeed the target of Y - 27632 and related compounds . First , the photoaffinity labeling using a photoactivable derivative of Y - 27632 detected ROCK kinases as an exclusive cellular binding protein with a specificity to various compounds iden - tical with that of cellular effects of these compounds ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . Second , as shown in this study as well as by other studies described above , the Y - compounds exert spe - cific inhibition of cellular processes such as stress fiber in - duction and neurite retraction , in which the involvement of ROCK kinases has been verified independently by the use of a dominant negative form of ROCK ( Ishizaki et al . , 1997 ; Hirose et al . , 1998 ) . Third and most intriguingly , Y - 27632 added at m M concentrations to permeabilized smooth muscle preparations together with millimolar concentrations of ATP induced specific inhibition of smooth muscle contraction through the Ca 2 1 sensitization mechanism , which is medi - ated by ROCK kinases ( Uehata et al . , 1997 , Fu et al . , 1998 ; Yoshii et al . , 1999 ) . These results suggest that , although the Y - compounds inhibit purified ROCK kinases in vitro in a cell free system by competing with ATP , an additional mecha - nism operates in the cell for Y - compounds to elicit specific inhibition of the kinases in situ . Recently , a variety of kinase inhibitors directed to the ATP - binding site have been devel - oped ( Toledo et al . , 1999 ) . These compounds exert specificity of their action by binding to the ATP - binding sites and occu - pying spaces that are diverse among various kinases . X - ray crystallography of the enzyme - inhibitor complex in some studies revealed that inhibitors such as SU - 5402 and PD 173074 , both directed to the fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase , induced additional conformational change of the en - zyme specific to each inhibitor ( Mohammadi et al . , 1997 ; Mohammadi et al . , 1998 ) . These compounds show competi - tion with ATP in an in vitro phosphorylation reaction using purified kinase , but nonetheless exert selective and potent inhibition of the target kinase expressed in the cells with almost identical IC 50 concentrations as their K i values , as seen for Y - 27632 [ see for example , Hirose et al . ( 1998 ) ] . These findings suggest that binding of these inhibitors and subse - quent conformational change of the target kinase not only competes for ATP binding but also causes additional inhibi - tory effects on the enzyme catalysis , possibly by interfering with binding of specific protein substrates . Whether Y - 27632 also induces specific conformational change in ROCK kinases awaits results of additional crystallization studies of the ROCK kinase in complex with the Y - compounds . This study also compared the inhibitory effects of the Y - compounds on three Rho - mediated processes , namely , the stress fiber induction , the G 1 - S progression , and cytokinesis . Y - 27632 inhibited the LPA - induced stress fiber formation at 10 m M , and Y - 30141 was about 10 times more potent than Y - 27632 in this action . These results are consistent with their potencies in inhibition of smooth muscle contraction and of neurite retraction , the involvement of ROCK kinases in both of which processes have been well established . The involvement of ROCK kinases in the formation of stress fibers have been established by the use of dominant negative mutants of these kinases ( Ishizaki et al . , 1997 ) . Prolonged incubation with Y - 27632 induced long neurite - like processes in Swiss 3T3 cells in a similar concentration - dependent man - ner . Our previous study showed that these processes were made mainly of microtubules and intermediate filaments , the growth of which was stimulated presumably by the loss of tension of the ROCK - mediated contractile actomyosin fila - ments ( Hirose et al . , 1998 ) . Whether ROCK has a direct action on the assembly and disassembly of microtubules re - mains unknown . During this study we noted that actin bun - dles reappeared in 24 h in the treatment with Y - 27632 and that these bundles were again abolished by the addition of freshly prepared Y - 27632 solution . We also found that the Y - 27632 - containing medium recovered from 24 - h culture with cells showed the decreased activity to inhibit stress fibers , whereas Y - 27632 incubated with the culture medium alone retained the original potency ( data not shown ) . These results indicated that Y - 27632 was somehow inactivated dur - ing incubation with cultured cells . In this study we found that the Y - compounds did not block but delayed the G 1 - S progression . Consistent with inhibition of other ROCK actions , Y - 30141 was ten times more active than Y - 27632 . However , much higher concentrations of both compounds were required for this action ; significant delay was observed only at 100 m M Y - 27632 . The treated cells also eventually moved to the S phase . This is in contrast to the action of C3 exoenzyme on the same line of cells that sup - presses the G 1 - S transition completely ( Yamamoto et al . , 1993 ; Olson et al . , 1995 ) . These results suggest that ROCK may not be a critical component in the regulation of the G 1 - S progression by Rho in this line of cells . This study , however , does not exclude that ROCK works critically in the G 1 - S transition in some other lines of cells . Y - 27632 significantly inhibited the thrombin - induced DNA synthesis in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells at 10 m M ( Seasholtz et al . , 1999 ) . Finally , we used the Y - compounds and examined the role of ROCK kinases in cytokinesis . We found that the actions of the Y - compounds on cytokinesis were different from those on stress fiber induction and that , like the delay in the G 1 - S transition , much higher concentrations were required ; more than 100 m M concentrations of Y - 27632 is required for sig - nificant inhibition , which exerted damaging effects on these cells . On the other hand , the present immunocytochemical study as well as the previous report ( Yasui et al . , 1998 ) revealed the enrichment of ROCK in the cleavage furrow , 982 Ishizaki et al . b y gue s t on O c t obe r 9 , 2011 m o l pha r m . a s pe t j ou r na l s . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m suggesting its involvement in cytokinesis . These results sug - gest the presence of a redundant or compensatory mecha - nism that can complement the inhibition of ROCK kinases . We have reported that another Rho effector , citron kinase , which shares about 40 % amino acid sequence identity in the kinase domain to ROCK kinases , also accumulates in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . As shown in this study , citron kinase is about 10 times more resistant to the Y - compounds ( Table 1 ) . Acknowledgments We thank T . Murozono for measuring the Y - 27632 concentration , H .
