INTRODUCTION Flow through microﬁlters occurs in numerous biological and industrial ﬂuid transport processes . Man - made examples include ﬁltering of air - or water - borne particles and biological agents . 1 – 3 Bi - ological microﬁlters are found , for example , in the phloem and xylem vascular systems of plants , where neighboring cells are separated by planar membranes covered with pores , 4 , 5 and in cell mem - branes where ﬂow occurs through aquaporin channels . 6 Figure 1 presents some of these examples as well as a sketch of a model microﬁlter . Such ﬂow conﬁgurations are usually modelled based on classical pressure - driven Stokes ﬂow through a single pore . In this paper , we further consider how ( i ) hydrodynamic interactions between the pores , ( ii ) the non - uniformity of pore sizes , and ( iii ) wall slip affect the pressure drop versus ﬂow rate relationship . Together , these features constitute the major practical factors governing a microﬁlter operating at low Reynolds numbers . We present a theoretically derived design formula that accounts for all three of these factors . Finally , we give the order of the scaling associated with the small inertial effects and compare it to experimental data derived from the literature . The ﬂow through a microﬁlter is induced by applying a pressure drop (cid:2) p across it . We denote U as the average velocity in a microﬁlter pore , a the pore radius , t the pore thickness , ρ the ﬂuid density , and μ the shear viscosity of the ﬂuid ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . In typical applications , the Reynolds number , R e = ρ Ua / μ , is small . For example , in MEMS applications involving ﬁltering of air , typical Reynolds number falls in the range 0 . 1 - 20 , 7 while in phloem sieve plates R e ≈ 10 − 4 ( see , e . g . , Jensen et al . 5 ) . Inertial effects are therefore expected to be small to moderate for microﬁlter ﬂows . Also , recall that the Mach number M a = U / c is deﬁned as the ratio of a typical ﬂuid velocity a ) Electronic mail : khjensen @ fysik . dtu . dk b ) Electronic mail : hastone @ princeton . edu 1070 - 6631 / 2014 / 26 ( 5 ) / 052004 / 13 / $ 30 . 00 C (cid:2) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC 26 , 052004 - 1 This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article .

For viscously dominated ﬂows , compressibility effects are negligible when the square of the Mach number is much smaller than the Reynolds number ( M 2 a (cid:4) R e ) , 8 which is typical for gas ﬂows of interest here . For example , based on the average velocity through a pore , the microﬁlters of Ho and co - workers 7 for handling gas ﬂows were always used at Mach numbers below 0 . 2 . It is therefore safe to assume compressibility effects are negligible , even for gas ﬂows . We will assume incompressibility of the ﬂow throughout our analysis . 9 Numerous studies on the topic of ﬁlter ﬂow have been performed . In the following we summarize results relevant to the context of our study . More than a century ago , Couette 12 was among the ﬁrst to discuss viscous dissipation of energy near the oriﬁce of a cylindrical tube . He added a ﬁctitious length to the actual tube length in Poiseuille’s formula to account for the pressure drop associated with ﬂow close to the aperture . One year later , in 1891 , Sampson 13 published an analytical solution of pressure - driven Stokes ﬂow through a single pore in an inﬁnite plane of zero thickness . Roscoe 14 later corrected a numerical error in Sampson’s formula and found solutions for ﬂow through elliptical pores and long slits using an electrostatic analogy . Weissberg 15 and subsequently Dagan et al . 16 considered the effects of a ﬁnite pore thickness . They showed that the ﬂow can be characterized by a linear superposition of the resistances due to Sampson ﬂow at the aperture and Poiseuille ﬂow inside the pore , in qualitative agreement with the observations by Couette . To account for hydrodynamic interactions , Hasimoto 17 studied ﬂow through an array of parallel slits , and found that interactions among neighboring slits tend to decrease the pressure drop required to drive a given ﬂow . This work was extended by Tio and Sadhal 18 and Wang , 19 who considered hydrodynamic interactions in ﬂows through regular arrays of circular and rectangular pores . Finally , Jensen et al . 5 studied the effect of a non - uniform pore size distribution on the ﬂow in biological ﬁlters . We extend these results to obtain a general analytical formula for the pressure drop across a mi - croﬁlter versus the ﬂow rate , which accounts for pore separation , the geometrical layout of the pores , wall slip , small inertial effects , and a non - uniform distribution of pore sizes . In particular , we go be - yond the simple superposition given by Eq . ( 5 ) by including the inﬂuence of the pore size distribution ( see Eq . ( 9 ) below ) and the interaction between pores ( see Eq . ( 15 ) below and Appendix A ) . This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article .

THE WEISSBERG - SAMPSON - POISEUILLE APPROXIMATION We begin our analysis by neglecting all inertial effects and approximating the ﬂow as an incompressible Stokes ﬂow . Sampson 13 solved the problem of Stokes ﬂow through a circular pore in an inﬁnitely thin plate due to a pressure drop applied across the pore . This conﬁguration is shown in Figure 2 ( a ) . Above and below the plate , the steady ﬂow satisﬁes the continuity and Stokes equations , ∇ · v = 0 and μ ∇ 2 v − ∇ p = 0 , ( 1 ) where v ( x ) and p ( x ) represent , respectively , the steady velocity and pressure ﬁelds . The boundary conditions are that ( i ) the velocity decays uniformly at inﬁnity , ( ii ) the no - slip condition holds everywhere at the ﬁlter ( x − y ) plane except at the pore , and ( iii ) the pressure approaches two distinct constants at + ∞ and at −∞ , hence inducing a ﬂow through the pore . Sampson found the pressure drop (cid:2) p = p −∞ − p ∞ versus ﬂow rate q relationship for a single pore to be 13 , 20 (cid:2) p q = 3 μ a 3 . ( 2 ) The streamlines are hyperbolae , and at large distances from the aperture the solution becomes identical to that for ﬂow from a point source in a wall . 20 In spherical coordinates ( see Fig . 2 ) the ﬂow is thus purely radial when ρ (cid:6) a v ρ = a 3 (cid:2) p 2 πμρ 2 cos 2 θ , ( 3a ) v θ = 0 . ( 3b ) The ﬂow proﬁle at the aperture ( z = 0 ) can be computed directly from Sampson’s stream function solution in cylindrical coordinates v r = 0 , ( 4a ) v z = a (cid:2) p 2 πμ (cid:2) 1 − (cid:3) r a (cid:4) 2 . ( 4b ) The relationship between pressure drop and ﬂow rate in Eq . ( 2 ) is valid for an inﬁnitely thin plate . In several applications , however , the plate thickness t is comparable to the pore radius a . This is the case , for example , in phloem sieve plates where t / a (cid:7) 0 . 5 . For low - Reynolds - number ﬂow through a pore of ﬁnite thickness t we can add the pressure drop 8 q μ t / ( π a 4 ) associated with the Poiseuille ﬂow along the pore ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) to the basic Sampson result to obtain the isolated FIG . 2 . ( a ) Sampson ﬂow through a circular pore in an inﬁnitely thin plate . The pore radius is denoted by a and the ﬂow rate by q . The pressure drop (cid:2) p = p −∞ − p ∞ is the difference between the pressures at plus and minus inﬁnity . ( b ) Poiseuille ﬂow along the thickness of a pore . The microﬁlter thickness is denoted by t . At low Reynolds numbers , the simplest result for the ratio of pressure drop to volumetric ﬂow rate per pore is obtained by linearly adding the pressure drops associated with the Sampson and Poiseuille ﬂows . 15 , 16 This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article .

Fluids 26 , 052004 ( 2014 ) pore - resistance formula (cid:2) p q = 3 μ a 3 + 8 μ t π a 4 . ( 5 ) This superposition approximation was ﬁrst proposed by Weissberg 15 and later conﬁrmed by Da - gan et al . , 16 who showed that the error incurred by linearly adding the Sampson and Poiseuille contributions to the pressure drop is greatest when t = 2 a , but less than one percent for all values of t / a . From the typical values of t and a in man - made and biological conﬁgurations , 7 , 11 we note that in general both the Sampson and Poiseuille contributions are signiﬁcant . In Secs . III – VI we address various hydrodynamic and geometric corrections to the basic result given in Eq . ( 5 ) . III . THE INFLUENCE OF A PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION In many practical ﬁlter applications , the pore radius a in Eq . ( 5 ) represents the mean value of a distribution of pore sizes . Here we quantify the effect of a distribution of radii by introducing a distribution function P ( a , σ ) , where σ indicates the parameters describing the distribution . In some cases it is plausible to consider a distribution of pore lengths , but we shall not do this here . To elucidate how a distribution of pore radii affects the ﬂow rate we begin by considering a ﬁnite set of N pores of radius a n , chosen according to the distribution function P ( a , σ ) . For a parallel coupling of pores , the pressure drop over each pore is identical (cid:2) p n = (cid:2) p , while the ﬂow rates q n add up to the total ﬂow rate Q = (cid:5) Nn = 1 q n . The average pore resistance is therefore (cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7) = (cid:2) p Q / N = (cid:2) p 1 N (cid:5) Nn = 1 q n . ( 6 ) For sufﬁciently large values of N we can replace the denominator on the right - hand side of Eq . ( 6 ) by its statistical expectation value 21 1 N N (cid:8) n = 1 q n = (cid:9) q ( a ) P ( a , σ ) d a = (cid:8) q (cid:9) , ( 7 ) where the integral goes over all permissible values of the pore radius a . Using the expression for the isolated pore resistance in Eq . ( 5 ) , we now ﬁnd that the average pore resistance is (cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7) = 3 μ (cid:10)(cid:9) (cid:11) 1 a 3 (cid:12) 1 + 8 3 π t a (cid:13)(cid:14) − 1 P ( a , σ ) d a (cid:15) − 1 . ( 8 ) To simplify Eq . ( 8 ) we normalize the pore size a by its average values ¯ a and introduce the variable ξ = a / ¯ a . With this change of variables we have (cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7) = 3 μ ¯ a 3 (cid:10)(cid:9) (cid:11) 1 ξ 3 (cid:12) 1 + A ξ (cid:13)(cid:14) − 1 P ( ξ ¯ a , σ ) ¯ a d ξ (cid:15) − 1 , ( 9 ) where the non - dimensional parameter A = 8 t / ( 3 π ¯ a ) is the ratio of the Poiseuille and Sampson contributions to the pore resistance . In the spirit of the approximations introduced by Weissberg 15 and Dagan et al . , 16 we approximate this integral by linearly superposing the limits of a thin pore , A (cid:4) 1 , and a long pore , A (cid:6) 1 , which has the form (cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7) ≈ 3 μ ¯ a 3 (cid:12) 1 M 3 + A M 4 (cid:13) . ( 10 ) Here , M 3 and M 4 are the third and fourth scaled statistical moments of the distribution P 21 M 3 = (cid:9) ξ 3 P ( ξ ¯ a , σ ) ¯ a d ξ and M 4 = (cid:9) ξ 4 P ( ξ ¯ a , σ ) ¯ a d ξ .

For each of these distributions the average pressure versus ﬂow rate relation can be calculated directly from Eq . ( 10 ) . A . Normally distributed pore radii We proceed to consider the case of a normal distribution of pore radii in detail . This distribution of pore radii is found , for example , in biological ﬁlters such as phloem sieve plates . 5 To quantify the effect of a distribution of radii on the resistance to ﬂow , we keep the average pore radius ¯ a constant and consider the pressure drop per ﬂow rate as a function of the polydispersity of the pore sizes . A measure of the dispersion is the ratio B = σ / ¯ a of the standard deviation σ to the mean pore radius ¯ a . The case B = 0 corresponds to a uniform pore size distribution . To elucidate how the pressure drop - ﬂow rate relation is affected by variations in pore size we introduce the function γ , which is the ratio of resistances with and without a pore size distribution , γ ( B ) = (cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7) B = 0 ≈ 1 1 + 3 B 2 + A 1 + 6 B 2 + 3 B 4 1 + A , ( 12 ) where we have used the expressions for the scaled moments M 3 and M 4 given in Table I . The resistance ratio γ is plotted as a function of the distribution width B for different values of the pore aspect ratio A in Fig . 3 ( a ) . We observe that the inﬂuence of the distribution is to diminish the pressure drop required to drive a given ﬂow . For narrow distributions ( B = 0 . 15 ) the required pressure is 5 % − 10 % lower , while for broad distributions ( B = 0 . 5 ) (cid:2) p is reduced by 40 % − 60 % , indicating that most of the ﬂow is diverted through larger pores . The variability in γ for a given value of B is determined by the pore aspect ratio A , bounded by the limiting cases of long pores ( A (cid:6) 1 ) and thin pores ( A (cid:4) 1 ) , as indicated in Fig . 3 ( a ) . The slope of γ ( shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) ) is most negative in the interval between B (cid:7) 0 . 25 and B (cid:7) 0 . 33 indicating that the gain in conductivity diminishes beyond this point . We note that distribution widths observed in phloem sieve plates fall in the range 0 . 21 < B < 0 . 34 . 5 IV . THE INFLUENCE OF HYDRODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS A . A pair of pores As described above , as a ﬁrst approximation to ﬂow through a microﬁlter , the ﬂow through each pore is assumed to be independent . In reality , there exist hydrodynamic interactions between the ﬂow through different pores . These interactions arise due to the pressure ﬁeld induced by ﬂow through individual pores . In this section , via elementary geometric arguments , we calculate the lowest - order correction to Sampson’s single - pore result that accounts for the hydrodynamic interactions between This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article .

Effect of pore size distribution on ﬁlter resistance . ( a ) Resistance ratio γ plotted as a function of the distribution width B = σ / ¯ a for normally distributed pores . The resistance ratio γ was calculated from the approximate result in Eq . ( 12 ) ( thin lines ) and from direct evaluation of the integral in Eq . ( 9 ) ( circles ) . Values of the pore aspect ratio A = 8 t / ( 3 π ¯ a ) are indicated in the plot . ( b ) Slope of the resistance ratio d γ / dB plotted as a function of the distribution width B . Depending on the value of A , the slope is most negative in the interval 0 . 25 < B < 0 . 33 ( shaded area ) . In ( a ) and ( b ) , thick solid and dashed lines show the asymptotic limits for A (cid:4) 1 and A (cid:6) 1 in Eq . ( 12 ) . identical pores . Under certain conditions , our procedure works for pores of different radii , which we discuss brieﬂy in Appendix A . An exact calculation for identical pores with square or hexagonal layouts was given by Tio and Sadhal 18 and Wang , 19 and we compare our approximate results to theirs . We ﬁrst treat the case of low - Reynolds - number ﬂow through two adjacent pores in the plane , depicted in Fig . 4 . Note that we let the pressures at ±∞ be anti - symmetric , with the positive pressure being at −∞ . Also , the upward volumetric ﬂow rate per pore q is taken as positive . We obtain the lowest - order correction for the change in the ﬂow rate as a function of the non - dimensional relative distance between the pores , L / a . Because of the symmetry of the problem : ( i ) the solution is anti - symmetric about the x − y plane , i . e . , v ( x , y , z ) = (cid:18) − v x ( x , y , − z ) , − v y ( x , y , − z ) , + v z ( x , y , − z ) (cid:19) and p ( x , y , z ) = − p ( x , y , − z ) , ( ii ) the pressure everywhere at the pore throats equals zero , and ( iii ) the velocity everywhere at the pore throats is strictly vertical , i . e . , v x ( x ) = v y ( x ) = 0 at z = 0 , see Eq . ( 4b ) . In view of these symmetries , we need only consider the upper half - plane z > 0 . To account for hydrodynamic interactions , and with reference to Fig . 4 , we note that adding Sampson’s single - pore solution centered about the left pore to Sampson’s single - pore solution centered about the right pore does not yield a valid solution to the two - pore problem because each single - pore solution produces a pressure proﬁle at the other pore that violates condition ( ii ) above . Speciﬁcally , for a single open pore , the axisymmetric pressure at the upper side of the x − y plane , FIG . 4 . Pressure - driven ﬂow through two pores in an inﬁnitely thin plane . The hydrodynamic interaction of the ﬂow between the two pores yields a larger ﬂow per pore than that predicted by Sampson’s classic result for an isolated pore , under the same pressure drop . The upward ﬂow per pore q is taken as positive . Here L denotes the center - to - center distance between the pores and a denotes the pore radii .

The inﬂuence of hydrodynamics interactions . ( a ) Plot of the pressure p single produced by ﬂow through a single pore on the top surface of the ﬁlter ( z = 0 ) . The pressure is a function of the distance r from the pore center , and it approaches the value p ∞ = − 3 μ q / ( 2 a 3 ) from below when r / a → ∞ . Results are shown for Sampson’s exact solution ( Eq . ( 13 ) , circles ) and the power series expansion ( Eq . ( 14 ) , red solid line ) . ( b ) Plot of the lowest - order correction G ( a / L ) 3 associated with hydrodynamic interaction effects to Sampson’s single - pore result , see Eq . ( 16 ) . Results are given for pores distributed in a square ( G = 1 . 9 ) and hexagonal ( G = 2 . 3 ) pattern . The correction is a function of the non - dimensional parameter L / a , where L denotes the center - to - center shortest distance between pores and a is the pore radius . p single , as a function of the radial distance r from the center of that pore is 20 p single ( r , z = 0 ) = (cid:23) 0 ( r < a ) − 3 π μ qa 3 (cid:3) 1 sinh ζ + tan − 1 ( sinh ζ ) (cid:4) ( r > a ) , ( 13 ) where ζ = cosh − 1 (cid:18) ra (cid:19) . When written as a power series for ( r / a ) (cid:6) 1 , Eq . ( 13 ) is p single ( r , z = 0 ) = − 3 μ q a 3 (cid:12) 1 2 + 1 3 π (cid:3) a r (cid:4) 3 + O (cid:11)(cid:3) a r (cid:4) 4 (cid:14)(cid:13) . ( 14 ) At large distances from the pore the pressure approaches the value p ∞ = − 3 μ q / ( 2 a 3 ) from below , as shown in Fig . 5 . The negative contribution to the pressure thus enhances the volume ﬂux through an adjacent pore . As a ﬁrst correction to account for the hydrodynamic interaction between the pores , we therefore subtract the value of the pressure produced by each single - pore solution at the center of the other pore ( r = L ) . Therefore , the formula for the pressure drop versus ﬂow rate per pore becomes (cid:2) p q = 3 μ a 3 (cid:12) 1 − 2 3 π (cid:3) a L (cid:4) 3 + h . o . t . (cid:13) , ( 15 ) where the order of magnitude of higher - order terms ( h . o . t . ) needs to be established by a more detailed argument . The factor of 2 in the (cid:18) aL (cid:19) 3 correction arises from the added pressure of opposite sign but equal magnitude on the lower half plane ( z < 0 ) . Equation ( 15 ) demonstrates that hydrodynamic interactions decrease the pressure drop required to produce a given ﬂow through a pore or , alternatively , for a given pressure drop , the ﬂow rate per pore is higher than predicted by Sampson’s single - pore result . We note that even after subtracting the single - pore pressure produced at the center of the other pore , condition ( ii ) above is still not satisﬁed , owing to pressure variations at distances r ≈ L + a . These pressure variations suggest corrections at least O ( a / L ) smaller than given in Eq . ( 15 ) . B . An array of pores To Sampson’s (cid:2) p / q ratio for an isolated pore one must linearly add the hydrodynamic corrections associated with the interaction between that pore and every other pore in the microﬁlter . The number of pores a given distance away depends on the geometrical arrangement of the pores in the microﬁlter . The correction is therefore a function of ( i ) the pattern layout of the pores in the ﬁlter and ( ii ) L / a , where L is deﬁned as the shortest distance between pores in that pattern . Thus , in general , we have (cid:2) p q ≈ 3 μ a 3 (cid:12) 1 − G (cid:3) a L (cid:4) 3 (cid:13) , ( 16 ) This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article .

Fluids 26 , 052004 ( 2014 ) where G is a constant dependent only on the geometrical layout of the pores in the microﬁlter . In particular , G is calculated by linearly adding the hydrodynamic interaction corrections between any given pore and all the other pores in the microﬁlter . For example , for the case where the pattern is a square grid of circular pores , with center - to - center spacing L , we ﬁnd G sq = 2 3 π ⎛ ⎝(cid:18) 4 + 2 1 / 2 (cid:19) ⎛ ⎝ ∞ (cid:8) j = 1 j − 3 ⎞ ⎠ + 8 ∞ (cid:8) j = 2 j − 1 (cid:8) i = 1 1 (cid:18) j 2 + i 2 (cid:19) 3 / 2 ⎞ ⎠ , ( 17 ) where (cid:5) ∞ j = 1 j − 3 ≈ 1 . 2 . Therefore , we ﬁnd G sq ≈ 1 . 9 . In addition , for the case of an hexagonal pattern , taking the limit where the pore pattern extends to inﬁnity , G hex ≈ 2 . 3 . These limiting results for the cases of inﬁnitely many pores have also been derived via an analytical corrective - iterative procedure by Tio and Sadhal , 18 whereby higher - order corrections were also found . Figure 5 shows the correction to Sampson’s base result as a function of L / a for the square and hexagonal patterns . Typical ﬁlters shown in Fig . 1 have values of L / a in the range 3 to 7 , thus , in practice , the increase in ﬂow due to the hydrodynamic interactions can change from being negligible to being about 10 % of Sampson’s isolated pore result . V . THE INFLUENCE OF SLIP A fundamental assumption used when deriving the base case , Eq . ( 5 ) , is that the ﬂow occurs in the continuum regime , where the Navier - Stokes equations and the no - slip condition at solid boundaries apply . For gas ﬂows , the validity of this approximation is measured by the Knudsen number ( K n = λ / a ) , the non - dimensional ratio of the mean free path λ of a molecule in the ﬂuid to the macroscopic characteristic lengthscale of the geometry , e . g . , the pore radius a . 9 , 22 For gas ﬂow through microﬁlters ( see , e . g . , Yang et al . 7 ) , based on the mean free path of air under standard conditions ( ≈ 65 nm ) , the Knudsen number is K n ≈ 0 . 01 − 0 . 03 . 7 At these values the dynamics are in the slip - ﬂow regime , 10 − 2 < K n < 10 − 1 , where the Navier - Stokes equations are still valid but they must be supplemented by a slip - ﬂow boundary condition at solid walls . 9 , 22 In this section , we provide a correction to Eq . ( 5 ) to account for slip effects . A similar slip ﬂow boundary condition is applicable to liquid ﬂows at the sub - micron scale when the liquid is adjacent to a solvophobic boundary . 23 In the slip - ﬂow regime the local tangential velocity v t ( x ) at a solid boundary is proportional to the tangential ﬂuid rate of strain at that point . 22 , 24 , 25 Speciﬁcally , for gas ﬂows adjacent to solid boundaries v t ( x ) = (cid:11) 2 − σ m σ m (cid:14) λ (cid:20) n · (cid:18) ∇ v ( x ) + ( ∇ v ( x ) ) T (cid:19)(cid:21) t . ( 18 ) Here , σ m is the tangential momentum accommodation coefﬁcient , whose value depends on wall surface properties , though empirically σ m ≈ 0 . 9 − 1 . 0 for air ﬂow . 9 , 26 For simplicity , henceforth we assume σ m = 1 , which corresponds to the case of perfect diffuse reﬂection of the gas molecules at the wall . 9 Finally , the [ · ] t notation indicates ( twice ) the tangential component of the ﬂuid strain rate at the wall ( n is the unit normal vector to the wall ) . We consider the corrections to the Sampson and Poiseuille pressure drops separately , implicitly assuming that the linear addition of the two terms remains a good approximation . First , a direct calculation shows that in Sampson’s solution the tangential stress at the ﬁlter walls is zero . 13 , 20 Thus , Sampson’s solution remains valid even under slip and the slip effects correction only affects the Poiseuille ﬂow pressure drop contribution , to which we turn next . For ﬂow along the pore , we take r as the radial distance from the pore axis and z as the axial coordinate along the ﬂow direction ( see Fig . 2 ( b ) ) , so the slip boundary condition ( 18 ) simpliﬁes to v z (cid:28)(cid:28) wall = − λ d v z dr (cid:28)(cid:28) wall . ( 19 ) For liquid ﬂows λ is referred to as the slip length . Solving the Stokes ﬂow equations ( 1 ) with this boundary condition and a pressure drop (cid:2) p across the pore of thickness t is a standard exercise .

For gas ﬂows , the slip effects decrease the Poiseuille pressure drop required to drive a given ﬂow rate by up to approximately 10 % for typical Knudsen numbers mentioned above . VI . THE INFLUENCE OF INERTIA A fundamental approximation used when deriving the basic result ( 5 ) was to neglect inertial effects . In this section we discuss how to account for low - Reynolds - number inertial corrections to this result . We do not consider high - Reynolds - number ﬂow here , but refer the reader to Refs . 8 and 28 . A general equation relating the pressure drop (cid:2) p , ﬂow rate q , viscosity μ , density ρ , and pore radius a can be obtained by dimensional analysis following , for example , Bond 29 and Johansen . 27 Since there are only two independent non - dimensional products of the ﬁve variables , we can write without loss of generality (cid:2) p q = μ a 3 φ ( R e ) , ( 21 ) where φ is an unknown function of the pore Reynolds number R e = ρ Ua / μ . Experimental values of φ can be obtained from the data collected by Johansen 20 , 27 who ﬂowed lubrication oil through sharp - edged circular oriﬁces situated inside a larger pipe . For low - Reynolds - number ﬂows in these conﬁgurations , we are only aware of two experimental papers dating back 80 years . 27 , 29 As shown in Fig . 6 , the prefactor in Eq . ( 21 ) determined by Johansen approaches φ = 3 at low Reynolds numbers , in accord with Sampson’s prediction in ( 2 ) . Similar results were found by Bond 29 who reported a prefactor of φ = 2 . 92 ± 0 . 05 in the limit R e (cid:4) 1 . In Fig . 6 , for values greater than R e ≈ 4 , the prefactor φ increases linearly with R e . To rationalize the dependence φ on the Reynolds number R e observed in Fig . 6 we note that at moderate Reynolds numbers , a signiﬁcant part of the pressure drop (cid:2) p is used for accelerating the liquid and thus increasing the kinetic energy of the ﬂow . To estimate this effect we use Bernoulli’s equation to approximate the inertial contribution to the total pressure drop 28 , 30 as (cid:2) p ≈ 3 μ q a 3 + ρ u 2 . ( 22 ) FIG . 6 . The prefactor φ in Eq . ( 21 ) plotted as a function of Reynolds number R e . Experimental data ( circles and squares ) from Johansen 20 , 27 ( Fig . 13 ) , who ﬂowed lubrication oil through sharp - edged circular oriﬁces of radius a situated inside a larger pipe of diameter D . Data shown here were obtained with 2 a / D = 0 . 090 ( circles ) and 2 a / D = 0 . 209 ( squares ) . Lines show the predictions of Eqs . ( 23 ) ( solid ) and ( 24 ) ( dashed , R te = 4 ) .

Fluids 26 , 052004 ( 2014 ) Rearranging , the pressure drop per ﬂow rate relation is (cid:2) p q ≈ μ a 3 (cid:12) 3 + R e π (cid:13) . ( 23 ) This result corresponds to φ ( R e ) = 3 + R e / π , which is plotted as a solid line in Fig . 6 . While the slope d φ / d R e = 1 / π is well capture by Eq . ( 23 ) , the onset of inertial corrections to the pure Sampson ﬂow ( i . e . , deviations from φ = 3 ) is seen to occur around a transition Reynolds number R te = 4 . Bond , who used thicker pores , found that the transition occurred at R te ≈ 10 . 29 The precise value of R te is thus likely to depend on the pore thickness , and on details of the ﬂow and the experimental boundary conditions . From the rough experimental data available , however , R te observed to approximately coincide with the point where the two contributions to the pressure loss in Eq . ( 22 ) are equal , i . e . , when R te = 3 π ≈ 9 . 4 . From these considerations , we present an empirical formula for the prefactor φ in Eq . ( 21 ) φ ( R e ) = 3 [ 1 + f ( R e ) ] , ( 24 ) where the function f is given by f ( R e ) = (cid:23) 0 R e < R te ( R e − R te ) / ( 3 π ) R e > R te . ( 25 ) This expression for the prefactor φ with R te = 4 is plotted as a dashed line in Fig . 6 . We can also discuss brieﬂy the limit R e (cid:4) 1 . In Appendix B we report the calculation of the O ( R e ) correction to the pressure - drop - ﬂow - rate relation . We use a regular perturbation expansion familiar in low - Reynolds - number ﬂows . 31 In fact , we ﬁnd there is no O ( R e ) correction , which suggests the next correction is O ( R 2 e ) . This feature is not inconsistent with the small variation in Fig . 6 for R e < 4 . VII . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In this article , we have classiﬁed the effects that contribute to the hydraulic resistance of a microﬁlter . Consider ﬁrst the case of a ﬁlter with a regular array of identical circular pores . Combining the different results presented in the article , we ﬁnd a formula for the pressure drop versus ﬂow rate per pore under the assumptions of incompressibility and low Reynolds numbers (cid:2) p q = 3 μ a 3 (cid:12) 1 − G (cid:3) a L (cid:4) 3 + 8 3 π t a (cid:11) 1 1 + 4 K n (cid:14) + f ( R e ) (cid:13) . ( 26 ) The μ / a 3 general scaling form for an inﬁnitely thin plate follows from dimensional analysis . The factor 3 represents the pressure drop associated with Sampson ﬂow through an isolated pore in a plane . The term − G ( a / L ) 3 represents the correction to Sampson’s result associated with the hydrodynamic interactions between the ﬂow through different pores , which turns out to increase the ﬂow through the pores at any given pressure drop . The constant G is a geometric factor , dependent on the pattern of pores , e . g . , G sq = 1 . 9 for a square pattern , G hex = 2 . 3 for an hexagonal pattern . The term 8 t / ( π a ) accounts for the pressure drop due to the Poiseuille ﬂow along the pore axis . This result assumed no - slip at the walls and therefore it is corrected by the factor 1 / ( 1 + 4 K n ) , where K n is the Knudsen number . Finally we found that the correction associated with the presence of inertial effects is given by f ( R e ) in Eq . ( 25 ) which we obtained using scaling arguments and comparison to experimental data obtained by Johansen . 27 If we then account for a distribution of pore radii with probability function P ( a , σ ) and focus on the case where hydrodynamic interactions , wall slip , and inertial effects are negligible , then Eq . ( 5 ) can be generalized to the average pressure drop per ﬂow rate (cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7) = 3 μ ¯ a 3 (cid:12) 1 M 3 + 1 M 4 8 3 π t ¯ a (cid:13) . ( 27 ) Here , ¯ a is the average pore radius and the factors M 3 and M 4 are the scaled moments deﬁned in Eq . ( 11 ) . The moments increase in magnitude with the distribution width , and the factors M 3 and This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article .

Fluids 26 , 052004 ( 2014 ) M 4 thus quantify by how much the ﬂow rate increases at a given pressure due to the dispersion of radii . As discussed in Appendix A it is straightforward to incorporate the effects of hydrodynamic interactions , wall slip , and inertia in the averaging over pore radii performed in Eq . ( 8 ) that leads to ( 27 ) . The formulas ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) allow for accurate design of microﬁlters for applications such as removal of air - or water - borne particles . The various effects discussed suggest that even slight modiﬁcations to pore size and density can have a large impact on the effective hydraulic resistance of the ﬁlter . We further note that all the effects considered here appear relatively straightforward to study experimentally in a microﬂuidic system . It would also be interesting to generalize the results to other pore geometries , for example , by considering ﬁbrous materials . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank N . M . Holbrook and M .

APPENDIX A : THE INFLUENCE OF HYDRODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PORES OF DIFFERENT SIZE We consider the hydrodynamic interaction between a pore of radius a i and the neighboring pores in an inﬁnitely thin plane . We assume that the pore radii follow a probability function P ( a , σ ) as discussed in Sec . III . For simplicity we ﬁrst assume that pore i only interacts with the n nearest pores located a distances L away from the centre of pore i . It is possible to consider longer range interactions and distributions of L but we shall not do that here . The pressure drop per ﬂow rate for pore i in the presence of neighboring pores can be written as (cid:2) p + δ p q i = 3 μ H i , ( A1 ) where 1 H i = 1 a 3 i (cid:12) 1 + 8 3 π t a i (cid:11) 1 1 + 4 K n , i (cid:14) + f ( R e , i ) (cid:13) ( A2 ) and δ p is the additional pressure drop due to hydrodynamic interactions . As discussed in the text leading to Eq . ( 15 ) , the change in the pressure drop due to one neighbor is 2 μ q / ( π r 3 ) , where r is the distance between the two interacting pores . Taking into account the nearest n neighbors leads to δ p = 2 π μ L 3 n (cid:8) j = 1 q j = 2 3 π (cid:2) p L 3 n (cid:8) j = 1 H j . ( A3 ) We evaluate the sums over the radii by taking the statistical average of H following Eq . ( 7 ) δ p = 2 n 3 π (cid:8) H (cid:9) L 3 (cid:2) p . ( A4 ) Using Eq . ( A4 ) in Eq . ( A1 ) and taking the expectation value of q leads to (cid:8) q (cid:9) = (cid:8) H (cid:9) 3 μ (cid:12) 1 + 2 n 3 π (cid:8) H (cid:9) L 3 (cid:13) (cid:2) p .

Fluids 26 , 052004 ( 2014 ) Equation ( A5 ) ﬁnally allows us to determine the ratio of pressure drop to ﬂow rate (cid:6) (cid:2) p q (cid:7) ≈ 3 μ (cid:8) H (cid:9) (cid:12) 1 − 2 n 3 π (cid:8) H (cid:9) L 3 (cid:13) . ( A6 ) Equation ( A6 ) has the same form as ( 16 ) and we identify 2 n / ( 3 π ) as the geometric factor G discussed in Sec . IV B . For the square array we can approximate n = 8 which yields G ≈ 1 . 7 in rough accord with the value G sq = 1 . 9 obtained from Eq . ( 17 ) . APPENDIX B : THE INFLUENCE OF INERTIA In this Appendix we argue that the low Reynolds number inertial correction to Eq . ( 5 ) scales as R 2 e . Since it is not clear that one may simply linearly add separate inertial corrections to the Sampson and the Poiseuille ﬂow results , let us address the full microﬁlter geometry , that is , we consider both the Sampson pore - in - a - plane geometry and the axial pore channel geometry as a single problem . To include inertial effects , we begin with the full Navier - Stokes equations . Non - dimensionalizing lengths by ˜ x = x / a , pressure by ˜ p = p / (cid:2) p , and velocities by ˜ v = v / ( (cid:2) pa / μ ) , the Reynolds number is deﬁned as R e = (cid:2) Pa 2 ρ / μ 2 , and the steady incompressible Navier - Stokes equations become ∇ 2 ˜ v − ∇ ˜ p = R e ( ˜ v · ∇ ˜ v ) , ( B1a ) ∇ · ˜ v = 0 . ( B1b ) These equations are subject to the boundary conditions ˜ v → 0 and ˜ p → ± 1 / 2 as | ˜ x | → ∓∞ and ˜ v = 0 at the ﬁlter walls . Let us denote the exact solution to Stokes equations in this non - dimensional formulation of the problem by ( ˜ v 0 , ˜ p 0 ) . Because of mass conservation the velocity at ±∞ decays as 1 / | ˜ x | 2 and consequently the Stokes solution is uniformly valid everywhere , i . e . , as R e → 0 , the relative size of the inertial term compared to the other two terms goes to zero , uniformly , everywhere in space . Therefore we conclude that the problem admits a regular perturbation expansion 31 ˜ v = ˜ v 0 + R e ˜ v 1 + R 2 e ˜ v 2 + O ( R 3 e ) , ( B2a ) ˜ p = ˜ v 0 + R e ˜ p 1 + R 2 e ˜ p 2 + O ( R 3 e ) . ( B2b ) Symmetry arguments will now sufﬁce to show that the ﬂow rate through the pore associated with the ˜ v 1 velocity ﬁeld must be zero . Substituting ( B2a ) and ( B2b ) into ( B1a ) and equating terms order by order in R e , yields at order 1 the equations ∇ 2 ˜ v 1 − ∇ ˜ p 1 = ˜ v 0 · ∇ ˜ v 0 ∇ · ˜ v 1 = 0 . ( B3 ) The symmetry of the geometry , the symmetry of the Stokes equations , and the symmetry of the boundary conditions imply that the Stokes solution ( ˜ v 0 , ˜ p 0 ) is anti - symmetric about the ˜ z = 0 plane ˜ v 0 ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) = ( − v 0˜ r ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) , v 0˜ z ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) ) , ( B4a ) ˜ p 0 ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) = − ˜ p 0 ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) , ( B4b ) where the subscripts indicate the corresponding velocity components . Therefore the term ˜ v 0 · ∇ ˜ v 0 satisﬁes the symmetry ( ˜ v 0 · ∇ ˜ v 0 ) ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) = ( ( ˜ v 0 · ∇ ˜ v 0 ) ˜ r ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) , − ( ˜ v 0 · ∇ ˜ v 0 ) ˜ z ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) ) . ( B5 ) Based on this symmetry of the inertial term ( B5 ) , the symmetry of Eq . ( B3 ) and the homogeneity of the boundary conditions that ( ˜ v 1 , ˜ p 1 ) satisﬁes ( both ˜ v 1 and ˜ p 1 go to zero at ±∞ ) , we conclude that ˜ v 1 ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) = ( ˜ v 1˜ r ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) , − ˜ v 1˜ z ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) ) . ( B6 ) This result implies that ˜ v 1 at ˜ z = 0 does not have a vertical component and thus there is no ﬂow across the pore associated with the ˜ v 1 velocity ﬁeld .

This time , deﬁning A ≡ ˜ v 0 · ∇ ˜ v 1 + ˜ v 1 · ∇ ˜ v 0 for notational simplicity , we have A ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) = ( − A ˜ r ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) , A ˜ z ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) ) , ( B7 ) and the symmetry of ˜ v 2 is of the form ˜ v 2 ( ˜ r , ˜ z ) = ( − ˜ v 2˜ r ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) , ˜ v 2˜ z ( ˜ r , − ˜ z ) ) , ( B8 ) hence , we cannot assert that ˜ v 2 has no vertical component at z = 0 . In dimensional form , we can therefore write the asymptotic correction to Eq . ( 5 ) that accounts for inertial effects as (cid:2) p q = 3 μ a 3 (cid:11)(cid:12) 1 + 8 3 π t a (cid:13) + O ( R 2 e ) (cid:14) . ( B9 ) 1 L . A .
