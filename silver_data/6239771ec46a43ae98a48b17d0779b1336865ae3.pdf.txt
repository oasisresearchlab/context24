For tier 1 , we individually genotyped 198 , 345 uniformly spaced and informative single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 443 sibling pairs discordant for PD . For tier 2a , we individually genotyped 1 , 793 PD - associated SNPs ( in tier 1 ) and 300 P ! . 01 genomic control SNPs in 332 matched case – unrelated control pairs . We identiﬁed 11 SNPs that were associated with PD ( ) in both tier 1 and tier 2 samples and had the same direction of effect . For these SNPs , we combined P ! . 01 data from the case – unaffected sibling pair ( tier 1 ) and case – unrelated control pair ( tier 2 ) samples and employed a liberalization of the sibling transmission / disequilibrium test to calculate odds ratios , 95 % conﬁdence intervals , and P values . A SNP within the semaphorin 5A gene ( SEMA5A ) had the lowest combined P value ( P p 7 . 62 # ) .

Introduction Association - based genome scans provide localizing in - formation that is much more precise ( often extending over a few thousand base pairs ) than the corresponding information from linkage - based studies ( which often ex - tend over many millions of base pairs ) . To date , there has been only one published high - resolution genome scan for association for any human disease ( Klein et al . 2005 ) . Here , we report the results of a high - resolution , whole - genome association study of Parkinson disease ( PD [ MIM 168600 ] ) . Our ﬁndings contribute to the cre - ation of a genomic predisposition map for PD , and we illustrate a tiered genotyping approach that can be ap - plied to the study of other complex diseases .

All methods of the study were approved by the investigational review board of the Mayo Clinic . Tier 1 For tier 1 , we included sibling pairs that were discor - dant for PD . Cases were enrolled prospectively from the clinical practice of the Department of Neurology of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , MN , from June 1996 through May 2004 . They all resided within Minnesota or one of the surrounding four states ( Wisconsin , Iowa , South Da - kota , or North Dakota ) . All cases underwent a standard - ized clinical assessment performed by a neurologist sub - specialized in movement disorders . Cases had at least two of four cardinal signs of parkinsonism ( rest tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia , and / or postural instability ) and no features atypical for PD ( such as unexplained upper mo - tor neuron signs or cerebellar signs ) . When nonmotor manifestations such as dysautonomia or dementia were present , they were mild and occurred late in the disease course . Subjects with secondary causes of parkinsonism ( e . g . , history of neuroleptic exposure , encephalitis , or multiple strokes ) were excluded . All patients treated with a daily dosage total of (cid:1) 1 g of levodopa ( in combination with carbidopa ) had a more than minimal improvement 686 Am . J . Hum .

We obtained a genealogical history from all cases , and , when permitted , we contacted available siblings for a telephone inter - view , to exclude parkinsonism via a validated screening instrument ( Rocca et al . 1998 ) . For cases , we obtained blood after a clinical assessment performed either at the Mayo Clinic or in the subjects’ homes . For siblings who screened negative for PD ( i . e . , who had none of the fol - lowing : prior diagnosis of PD , prior treatment with levo - dopa , or three or more of nine symptoms ) , we obtained blood via mail - in kits ( we did no clinical assessment ) . All subjects provided written informed consent ; their whole blood was obtained , via venipuncture , for DNA extraction ( via the Puregene method [ Gentra Sciences ] ) and storage . Cases were matched to a single participating sibling , without PD or parkinsonism , ﬁrst by sex ( when possible ) and then by closest age . For each subject ( matched discordant sibling pairs ) , ∼ 1 m g of DNA was shipped to Perlegen Sciences for laboratory study . Whole - genome ampliﬁcation was per - formed as described elsewhere ( Dean et al . 2002 ) . For each subject , DNA was individually genotyped , for a set of 248 , 535 SNPs , with unique positions on National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) build 34 . These SNPs were selected to have relatively uniform spacing across the genome and to preferentially in - clude haplotype - deﬁning common SNPs from the Perle - gen haplotype map ( Patil et al . 2001 ) . Details regarding the distribution of genomic gaps is provided in table 1 . The genotyping platform employed high - density oligo - nucleotide , photolithographic microarrays ( DNA chips ) , such that one hybridization yielded genotypes for 85 , 000 SNPs in a single individual . We performed a liberalization of the sibling transmis - sion / disequilibrium test ( sTDT ) ( Schaid and Rowland 1998 ) to identify SNPs that had signiﬁcant allele - fre - quency differences in cases versus unaffected siblings , adjusting the analyses for age and sex . For each SNP , we calculated odds ratios ( ORs ) , 95 % CIs , and P values ( using a log - additive or “trend” model ) . Tier 2 For tiers 2a and 2b , we individually genotyped case – unrelated control pairs . Cases were enrolled as for tier 1 but had no siblings available . Unrelated controls were identiﬁed via random digit dialing from the same ﬁve - state region as the cases and were screened negative for parkinsonism via the same validated telephone instru - ment as for siblings in tier 1 . DNA was collected at the time of clinical assessment for cases and via mail - in kits for controls . Case – unrelated control pairs were matched for sex and age ( (cid:2) 3 years ) . DNA was again shipped to Perlegen Sciences for whole - genome ampliﬁcation and genotyping . The genotyping for tiers 2a and 2b was per - formed using customized oligonucleotide microarrays . For tier 2a , a subset of SNPs that were associated with PD ( in tier 1 ) were genotyped . An additional P ! . 01 predeﬁned set of 311 SNPs was genotyped for genomic control ( Hinds et al . 2004 ) . Conditional logistic regres - sion analyses were performed , to test for and model as - sociations between the SNPs and PD . The analyses were adjusted for age and sex , as appropriate . We calculated ORs , 95 % CIs , and P values ( as for tier 1 , using a log additive or “trend” model ) . We also checked for popu - lation structure , using the genomic - control method ( Dev - lin and Roeder 1999 ; Bacanu et al . 2000 ; Devlin et al . 2004 ) . This method treats the subjects as unmatched and does not include adjustments for covariates ; however , it should still provide guidelines for assessing the degree of stratiﬁcation in tier 2 . For the SNPs associated with PD ( ) in both the tier 1 and 2a analyses , we P ! . 01 pooled data for the case – unaffected sibling and case – unrelated control pairs and again analyzed the data , us - ing a liberalization of the sTDT ( Schaid and Rowland 1998 ) . This allowed us to maximize statistical power for the analyses to obtain a more precise ranking of repli - cated SNPs by ascending P values and a more precise estimate of ORs and 95 % CIs . For tier 2b , we also selected for genotyping additional SNPs that in tier 1 were only borderline signiﬁcant but that tested a priori biological or genetic hypotheses re - garding genomic susceptibility to PD . These SNPs did not achieve a P value ! . 01 in the tier 1 sample overall . However , some of these SNPs ( 1 ) had P values ! . 001 in tier 1 strata deﬁned by sex or by median age at study ; ( 2 ) had P values ! . 05 and were positioned within 10 kb of the linkage - derived candidate genes a - synu - clein ( SNCA [ MIM 163890 ] ) , parkin ( MIM 602544 ) , ubiquitin carboxy - terminal hydrolase L1 ( UCHL1 [ MIM 191342 ] ) , microtubule - associated protein t ( MAPT [ MIM 157140 ] ) , oncogene DJ1 ( DJ1 [ MIM 602533 ] ) , and PTEN - induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 [ MIM 608309 ] ) ; ( 3 ) had P values ! . 05 and were positioned within ad - ditional loci linked to PD ( i . e . , PARK3 [ MIM 602404 ] , PARK8 [ MIM 607060 ] , PARK9 [ MIM 606693 ] , PARK10 [ MIM 606852 ] , PARK11 [ MIM 607688 ] ) ; ( 4 ) had P values ! . 05 and were positioned within exons or within 10 kb 5 (cid:2) of the transcript , genomewide ; or ( 5 ) were redundant tags of European American linkage - dis - equilibrium bins ( Hinds et al . 2005 ) highlighted by some Maraganore et al . : Whole - Genome Association Study of PD 687 Table 2 Demographic and Clinical Characteristics ( Tiers 1 and 2 ) C HARACTERISTICS F INDINGS FOR S UBJECTS Tier 1 Tier 2 PD Cases Siblings PD Cases Controls No .

We note that the tier 2b SNP se - lection predated the discovery of mutations in the leu - cine - rich repeat kinase 2 gene ( LRRK2 [ MIM 609007 ] ) as the cause of PARK8 - linked parkinsonism ( although SNPs within the gene were indeed selected and geno - typed ) . We tested the association of these tier 2b SNPs with PD in the combined samples , using a liberalization of the sTDT ( as above ) . Results Tier 1 For tier 1 , we genotyped 443 case – unaffected sibling pairs . Table 2 summarizes demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample . For the 248 , 535 SNPs se - lected , the genotyping call rate was 1 80 % for each of 220 , 143 SNPs . Of these SNPs , 205 , 031 ( 93 % ) were polymorphic within the study sample . The Hardy - Wein - berg equilibrium ( HWE ) P value was 1 . 001 in con - trols for 198 , 345 SNPs ( 97 % of polymorphic SNPs , with an average gap between adjacent SNPs of 12 , 363 bp ) . Ultimately , for these subjects and informative SNPs , 172 , 420 , 019 genotype calls ( 98 . 1 % of possible geno - types ) were made . We regenotyped , in triplicate , 96 SNPs for each subject , with 99 . 8 % concordance of genotypes . The concordance of genotypes called by the oligonucleo - tide array platform , as compared with genotypes called by other platforms employed as part of the multicenter HapMap project , was 99 . 5 % ( Hinds et al . 2005 ) . As a sensitivity analysis and to assess the genomic coverage of the informative SNPs , we determined our statistical power to detect unassayed , disease - associated variants with this SNP collection . Speciﬁcally , we pre - viously genotyped these same SNPs in a different sample of European Americans who were also sequenced across selected genes by the SeattleSNPs Program for Genomic Applications ( PGA ) ( SeattleSNPs ) ( Hinds et al . 2005 ) . Our metric of coverage was the mean r 2 value for any common PGA SNP ( minor - allele frequency 1 10 % ) with the most - correlated SNP in the same region from the 198 , 345 informative SNPs . The statistical power to de - tect an unassayed , disease - associated allele indirectly by use of a correlated allele of an assayed SNP is related to r 2 . Speciﬁcally , the power to detect an association indirectly in N samples is equivalent to the power to detect it directly in Nr 2 samples ( Pritchard and Przewor - ski 2001 ) . Despite our assaying only 3 . 3 % of all of the common SNPs in these intervals ( and only 1 % of the less common SNPs ) , the mean r 2 for unassayed SNPs was 0 . 57 . 688 Am . J . Hum . Genet . 77 : 685 – 693 , 2005 Table 3 Column Descriptions for Text Files 1 and 2 The table is available in its entirety in the online edition of The American Journal of Human Genetics . There were 1 , 862 SNPs that were associated with PD in tier 1 ( ) , after exclusion of SNPs with fewer P ! . 01 than nine discordances between sibling pairs ( SNPs for which ORs could not be reliably estimated ) . We provide details for all informative tier 1 SNPs ( including their dbSNP reference sequence identiﬁcation numbers , gene names , case and control allele frequencies , ORs , 95 % CIs , and P values ) in tab - delimited text ﬁle 1 ( online only ) ; the columns are described in table 3 . Tier 2 For tier 2a , we genotyped 332 case – unrelated con - trol pairs . Table 2 summarizes demographic and clinical characteristics for these samples . Genotypes and analy - ses were attempted for the 1 , 862 SNPs selected in tier 1 and for 311 genomic control SNPs . Of these , geno - typing call rates of 1 80 % and HWE P values 1 . 001 ( in controls ) were achieved for 1 , 793 SNPs . We were able to call successfully 1 , 176 , 772 ( 99 % of possible ) geno - types for these SNPs . To assess the impact of population structure on tier 2 associations , trend tests were performed on the ge - nomic control SNPs . The mean trend test statistic over the genomic control SNPs , l m , was 0 . 96 , which is less than the expected value of 1 for no population structure ( Devlin et al . 2004 ) . Therefore , there was no indication of substantial confounding due to population structure bias . There were 26 SNPs with P values ! . 01 in both tier 1 and tier 2a . Of these SNPs , 11 had nominal P val - ues ! . 01 and the same direction of the effect in tier 1 and tier 2a ( termed “replicated SNPs” ) . A SNP ( rs7702187 ) within the semaphorin 5A gene ( SEMA5A [ MIM 609297 ] ) had the lowest P value ( OR 1 . 74 ; 95 % CI 1 . 36 – 2 . 24 ; ) . A second SNP (cid:2) 6 P p 7 . 62 # 10 ( rs10200894 ) tagged the PARK11 late - onset PD sus - ceptibility locus ( OR 1 . 84 ; 95 % CI 1 . 38 – 2 . 45 ; P p ) . Table 4 lists the 11 replicated SNPs , in - (cid:2) 5 1 . 70 # 10 cluding their dbSNP reference sequence identiﬁcation numbers and , when applicable , the corresponding gene ontology annotation of nearby genes . The SNPs are or - dered by ascending combined P values . We provide ad - ditional results for the tier 2a SNPs ( including their dbSNP reference sequence identiﬁcation numbers and gene names and , for the combined samples , the case and control allele frequencies , ORs , 95 % CIs , and P values ) , in tab - delimited text ﬁle 2 ( online only ) ; the columns are described in table 3 . The 11 replicated SNPs from tiers 1 and 2a ( table 4 ) had 20 neighboring SNPs within a distance of 15 kb of the reported data . None of these 20 SNPs were signiﬁcant enough to be selected for in - clusion in tier 2a . However , 6 of the 20 SNPs had tier 1 P values ! . 1 ( on a binomial test ) , and 14 of P p . 011 these 20 had P values ! . 2 ( ) . Thus , there (cid:2) 6 P p 1 . 8 # 10 is evidence of correlations among neighboring SNPs . Table 5 summarizes the rationale for inclusion of the tier 2b SNPs , primarily on the basis of a priori biologi - cal and genetic hypotheses regarding susceptibility to PD . We considered 975 tier 2b SNPs . Of these , geno - typing call rates of 1 80 % and HWE P values 1 . 001 in controls were achieved for 941 SNPs . We were able to call successfully 617 , 257 ( 99 % of maximum possible ) genotypes for these SNPs . Of these , the two SNPs ( rs682705 and rs7520966 ) with the lowest combined tier 1 and tier 2b P values ( , OR 0 . 66 , (cid:2) 6 P p 9 . 07 # 10 95 % CI 0 . 54 – 0 . 79 and OR 0 . 67 , 95 % (cid:2) 5 P p 2 . 96 # 10 CI 0 . 55 – 0 . 81 , respectively ) tagged the PARK10 late - on - set PD susceptibility locus . The r 2 value between the two SNPs was 0 . 993 ( highly correlated ) . We provide addi - tional results for the tier 2b SNPs ( including their dbSNP reference sequence identiﬁcation numbers , gene names , case and control allele frequencies , ORs , 95 % CIs , and P values ) in tab - delimited text ﬁle 2 ( online only ) . Discussion Twin studies and familial aggregation studies have sug - gested that the genetic contribution to PD is small and limited to younger - onset cases ( Rocca et al . 2004 ; Wirde - feldt et al . 2004 ) . However , parametric linkage studies have assigned 11 loci to PD , and causal mutations have been identiﬁed in six genes ( SNCA , parkin , UCHL1 , DJ1 , PINK1 , and LRRK2 ) ( Polymeropoulos et al . 1997 ; Ki - tada et al . 1998 ; Leroy et al . 1998 ; Bonifati et al . 2003 ; Valente et al . 2004 ; Zimprich et al . 2004 ) . Nonpara - metric linkage studies have also assigned the locus con - taining the MAPT gene to PD ( Martin et al . 2001 ) . Whereas mutations in these genes only rarely cause PD , common variations in some of these genes may confer susceptibility with a more sizable population - attributa - ble risk ( Farrer et al . 2001 ; West et al . 2002 ; Maraganore et al . 2004 ; Mamah et al . 2005 ; Mueller et al . 2005 ) . However , the search for PD susceptibility genes has been largely limited to the candidate - genes approach . Our study is unique because we aimed to discover common PD susceptibility gene variants via a whole - genome association design . Despite the low heritability of PD , we have nominated several new susceptibility genes for PD ( table 4 ) . Findings for the SEMA5A gene are particularly noteworthy and highlight the apoptosis pathway ( Tatton et al . 2003 ) . The SEMA5A gene ( sema domain , seven thrombo - spondin repeats [ type 1 and type 1 – like ] , transmem - brane domain [ TM ] , and short cytoplasmic domain , [ semaphorin ] 5A ) has not been previously implicated in T a b l e 4 G e no m i c S N P s A ss o c i a t e d w i t h P D i n T w o Sa m p l e s ( T i e rs 1 a nd 2 ) db S N P N U M BE R G E N E N A M E N C B I B U I L D 35 . 1 B R A I N a G E N E O N T O L O G Y b S U MM A RY b , c O R d ( 95 % C I ) P d F un c t i on P r o ce ss C o m pon e n t rs 7702187 S E M A 5 A 5p15 . 2 Y e s R ece p t o r a c t i v i t y C e ll a dh e s i on ; ce ll - ce ll s i g n a li n g ; n e u r o g e n e s i s I n t e g r a l t o m e m b r a n e A xon a l g u i d a n ce ( n e u r a l d e v e l op m e n t ) ; i n i t i a - t i on o f n e u r on a l a pop t o s i s 1 . 74 ( 1 . 36 – 2 . 24 ) (cid:2) 6 7 . 62 # 10 rs 10200894 … 2q36 … … … … P ARK 11 l o c u s 1 . 84 ( 1 . 38 – 2 . 45 ) (cid:2) 5 1 . 70 # 10 rs 2313982 … 4q31 . 1 … … … … … 2 . 01 ( 1 . 44 – 2 . 79 ) (cid:2) 5 1 . 79 # 10 rs 17329669 … 7p14 … … … … … 1 . 71 ( 1 . 33 – 2 . 21 ) (cid:2) 5 2 . 30 # 10 rs 7723605 … 5p15 . 3 … … … … … 1 . 78 ( 1 . 35 – 2 . 35 ) (cid:2) 5 3 . 30 # 10 ss 46548856 e … … … … … … … 1 . 88 ( 1 . 38 – 2 . 57 ) (cid:2) 5 3 . 65 # 10 rs 16851009 G A L N T 3 2q24 Y e s M a n ga n e s e , s u ga r b i nd i n g ; t r a n s f e r a s e a c t i v i t y C a r boh y d r a t e m e t a bo li s m G o l g i a pp a r a t u s ; i n t e g r a l t o m e m b r a n e M a r k e r o f d i ff e r e n t i a t i on a nd agg r e ss i v e n e ss ( s e v e r a l c a n ce rs ) 1 . 84 ( 1 . 36 – 2 . 49 ) (cid:2) 5 4 . 17 # 10 rs 2245218 P R D M 2 1p36 . 2 Y e s D N A , m e t a l , z i n c b i nd i n g ; t r a n s c r i p t i on f a c t o r , r e g u l a t o r a c t i v i t y T r a n s c r i p t i on r e g u l a t i on N u c l e u s T u m o r s upp r e ss i on ; n e u - r on a l d i ff e r e n t i a t i on ; e s t r o g e n r ece p t o r b i nd - i n g ; e s t r o g e n e ff ec t o r 1 . 67 ( 1 . 29 – 2 . 14 ) (cid:2) 5 4 . 61 # 10 rs 7878232 P A S D 1 X q28 Y e s S i g n a l t r a n s du ce r a c t i v i t y S i g n a l t r a n s du c t i on … X - li nk e d 1 . 38 ( 1 . 17 – 1 . 62 ) (cid:2) 5 6 . 87 # 10 rs 1509269 … 4q31 . 1 … … … … … 1 . 71 ( 1 . 30 – 2 . 26 ) (cid:2) 5 9 . 21 # 10 rs 11737074 … 4q27 … … … … … 1 . 50 ( 1 . 21 – 1 . 86 ) (cid:2) 4 1 . 55 # 10 a E v i d e n ce o f b r a i n e xp r e ss i on .

Although the effect size is small ( OR 1 . 7 ; 95 % CI 1 . 36 – 2 . 24 ) , the disease - associated allele occurs with suf - ﬁcient frequency to confer a sizable population - attrib - utable risk ( minor - allele for unre - frequency p 19 . 6 % lated controls ) . This gene maps to the deletion candidate interval for cri du chat syndrome . This chromosomal deletion syndrome is associated with severe abnormal - ities in brain development , with resultant mental retar - dation ( Simmons et al . 1998 ) . The encoded semaphorin protein has receptor activity and contributes to neuro - genesis and apoptotic processes . It elicits multiple func - tional responses through its receptor plexin - B3 ( Arti - giani et al . 2004 ) . Speciﬁcally , semaphorins may play a role in the development of the mesencephalic dopamine neuron system ( Kawano et al . 2003 ) . They are also pos - itive mediators of dopamine - induced apoptosis ; anti - bodies directed against semaphorins inhibit dopa - mine - induced neuronal death ( Shirvan et al . 1999 , 2000 ; Barzilai et al . 2000 ) . The expression of sema - phorin genes is abnormal in Alzheimer disease , which shares clinical , pathological , and etiological features with PD ( Hirsch et al . 1999 ) . It has also been suggested in a rat model of PD that the neuroprotective effects of vascular endothelial growth factor may be mediated via semaphorin inhibition ( Yasuhara et al . 2004 ) . To date , there have been no clinical studies of semaphorin in - hibitors as neuroprotective therapy for PD . Our genetic ﬁndings converge with cell biology and animal experi - ments to support the research and development of ther - apies targeting semaphorins as neuroprotection for PD . Several additional ﬁndings of the whole - genome scan are consistent with our current understanding of PD ( table 4 ) . One of the replicated SNPs mapped the PARK11 locus , which showed signiﬁcant linkage to PD in one study but not in another ( Pankratz et al . 2003 ; Prestel et al . 2005 ) . Another replicated SNP was within the cancer - related UDP - N - acetyl - a - D - galactos - amine : polypeptide N - acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 gene ( GALNT3 [ MIM 601756 ] ) . This may be consis - tent with epidemiological studies that suggest that pa - tients with PD have a higher risk of cancers after the diagnosis of PD ( Elbaz et al . 2005 ) . Another replicated SNP was within the PR domain – containing protein 2 gene ( PRDM2 [ MIM 601196 ] ) , which is also related to neuronal differentiation and cancer . That gene is also estrogen related . This may be consistent with epide - miological data suggesting that endogenous estrogen and estrogen treatment are protective against PD ( Be - nedetti et al . 2001 ) . Finally , a replicated SNP was within the chromosome X gene PASD1 ( PAS domain – contain - ing 1 ) . X inactivation of a major susceptibility gene could explain the sex difference in lifetime risk of PD ( men have a 1 . 5 - times - greater risk than women ) ( Elbaz et al . 2002 ; Carrel and Willard 2005 ) . Our tier 2b , hypothesis - based SNP analyses were noteworthy for highlighting a chromosome 1p32 locus previously linked to late - onset PD susceptibility . The PARK10 locus was originally identiﬁed in Icelandic fami - lies via a genomewide scan with use of microsatellite markers ( Hicks et al . 2002 ) . This locus was subse - quently shown to inﬂuence age at onset in a multicenter study of families with PD ( Li et al . 2002 ) . To date , a speciﬁc gene within the PARK10 locus has not been identiﬁed . Our disease - associated SNPs ( rs682705 and rs7520966 ) are within a gene designated LOC200008 , which encodes a hypothetical protein with inferred oxi - doreductase activity and potential involvement in cho - lesterol biosynthesis and electron transport . The SNPs are also within 21 kb upstream of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L37 gene ( MRPL37 ) . Mitochondrial mechanisms of PD pathogenesis have been described ( Dauer and Przedborski 2003 ) , and a role for mito - chondrial ribosomal protein genes in human disorders has been postulated ( Kenmochi et al . 2001 ) . To our knowledge , our study is the ﬁrst high - reso - lution , whole - genome association study published about PD . Recent review articles anticipated such studies ( Hirschhorn and Daly 2005 ; Wang et al . 2005 ) , but our present understanding of human genome variability and the available high - throughput genotyping technologies currently allow for whole - genome studies ( Patil et al . 2001 ; Olivier et al . 2001 ; Hinds et al . 2005 ) . Also , our Maraganore et al . : Whole - Genome Association Study of PD 691 two - tiered study design had several strengths . First , we performed a family - based case - control study ( tier 1 ) . This limited false - positive results due to population stratiﬁcation bias ( Maraganore 2005 ) . However , the re - latedness of cases and siblings may have reduced sta - tistical power to detect genetic associations ( false - nega - tive results ) . Second , we performed a case – unrelated control study ( tiers 2a and 2b ) . The use of unrelated controls ( rather than unaffected siblings ) optimized sta - tistical power for the replication study ( Maraganore 2005 ) . It is noteworthy that , for tier 2 , there was mini - mal population structure , despite the inclusion of un - related cases and controls . This is fortunate , since we therefore did not need to stratify the analyses for the tier 2 sample . It is also a strength of our study that all subjects were individually genotyped ( no pooling of DNA samples was involved ) . This allowed analyses ad - justed or stratiﬁed for age and sex , factors that have been shown elsewhere to inﬂuence heritability in PD ( Rocca et al . 2004 ; Mueller et al . 2005 ) . Individual ge - notyping will also allow us to perform studies of com - plex gene - gene and gene - environment interactions and genotype - phenotype correlations within the available data set . It is intriguing that 7 of the 11 replicated SNPs are intergenic . This may suggest that intergenic sequences are important to health , perhaps via gene regulatory effects ( Martens et al . 2004 ) . It is likely that the number of SNPs genotyped—or the speciﬁc ones selected—as well as the available sam - ple size resulted in our missing disease - associated loci across the human genome ( Carlson et al . 2003 , 2004 ; Wang et al . 2005 ) . However , we observed an association of SNPs neighboring the 11 replicated SNPs ( “cluster - ing” ) , which suggests that we achieved an appreciable map density . Also , with the available samples , we de - tected signiﬁcant ( ) ORs (cid:1) 1 . 34 in tier 1 , (cid:1) 1 . 33 P ! . 01 in tier 2a , and (cid:1) 1 . 21 in the combined analysis . It is also likely that multiple statistical comparisons or other factors resulted in false - positive ﬁndings ( Storey and Tibshirani 2003 ; Hirschhorn and Daly 2005 ) . None of our results were signiﬁcant with use of a strict Bonfer - roni correction for the number of tests ( 198 , 345 SNPs for tier 1 and the combined analyses , 1 , 466 SNPs for tier 2a , and 1 , 312 SNPs for tier 2b ) . However , this is a very conservative evaluation of signiﬁcance ; it assumes total independence of the tests , and properly correcting for the correlational structure among the SNPs is not straightforward . Eleven SNPs had P values ! . 01 and the same direction of the effect in both tiers 1 and 2a , and many of these SNPs have compelling potential biologi - cal relationships with PD or are in regions otherwise implicated in PD via linkage analysis ( “convergence” ) . The results of this study draw a ﬁrst genomic map of PD , which awaits replication across populations ( includ - ing collaborative - pooled analyses within global consor - tia ) . Our ﬁndings may ultimately identify biomarkers that contribute to early disease detection and primary prevention strategies . Also , they may nominate new mo - lecular targets for disease - modifying therapies ( second - ary prevention ) . Correlation studies of genotypes to prognostic outcomes may predict the effect of treat - ments targeting these genes and their proteins ( “virtual clinical trials” ) and thus reduce research and develop - ments costs and identify subgroups of patients most likely to beneﬁt from treatment ( personalized medicine ) .
