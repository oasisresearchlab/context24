Arp2 / 3 Branched Actin Network Mediates Filopodia - Like Bundles Formation InVitro Yaron Ideses 1 , Yifat Brill - Karniely 2 , Lior Haviv 1 , Avinoam Ben - Shaul 2 , Anne Bernheim - Groswasser 1 * 1 Ben - Gurion University of the Negev , Beer - Sheva , Israel , 2 The Hebrew University , Jerusalem , Israel Abstract During cellular migration , regulated actin assembly takes place at the cell leading edge , with continuous disassembly deeper in the cell interior . Actin polymerization at the plasma membrane results in the extension of cellular protrusions in the form of lamellipodia and filopodia . To understand how cells regulate the transformation of lamellipodia into filopodia , and to determine the major factors that control their transition , we studied actin self - assembly in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex , WASp - VCA and fascin , the major proteins participating in the assembly of lamellipodia and filopodia . We show that in the early stages of actin polymerization fascin is passive while Arp2 / 3 mediates the formation of dense and highly branched aster - like networks of actin . Once filaments in the periphery of an aster get long enough , fascin becomes active , linking the filaments into bundles which emanate radially from the aster’s surface , resulting in the formation of star - like structures . We show that the number of bundles nucleated per star , as well as their thickness and length , is controlled by the initial concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] ) . Specifically , we tested several values of [ Arp2 / 3 ] and found that for given initial concentrations of actin and fascin , the number of bundles per star , as well as their length and thickness are larger when [ Arp2 / 3 ] is lower . Our experimental findings can be interpreted and explained using a theoretical scheme which combines Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for aster growth , with a simple mechanistic model for bundles’ formation and growth . According to this model , bundles emerge from the aster’s ( sparsely branched ) surface layer . Bundles begin to form when the bending energy associated with bringing two filaments into contact is compensated by the energetic gain resulting from their fascin linking energy . As time evolves the initially thin and short bundles elongate , thus reducing their bending energy and allowing them to further associate and create thicker bundles , until all actin monomers are consumed . This process is essentially irreversible on the time scale of actin polymerization . Two structural parameters , L , which is proportional to the length of filament tips at the aster periphery and b , the spacing between their origins , dictate the onset of bundling ; both depending on [ Arp2 / 3 ] . Cells may use a similar mechanism to regulate filopodia formation along the cell leading edge . Such a mechanism may allow cells to have control over the localization of filopodia by recruiting specific proteins that regulate filaments length ( e . g . , Dia2 ) to specific sites along lamellipodia .

The distinct organization and generation of filaments in each structure uses a different mechanism to produce mechanical force . In the lamellipodia , the actin filaments organize into a flat 2D branched network [ 2 , 4 ] whereas in the filopodia they are assembled into long , parallel , closely packed bundles [ 5 – 7 ] . Different proteins control the assembly of these structures ; in the lamellipodia , the branched nucleation is driven by activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 8 ] by Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein family [ 9 , 10 ] ( WASP ) , followed by filament elongation and barbed - end capping by capping proteins ( CP ) [ 11 ] . Formin and Ena / VASP proteins are concentrated at the tips of filopodia [ 12 – 15 ] promoting the continuous elongation of filaments [ 3 , 16 ] and their successive binding by fascin , which crosslinks actin filaments of the same polarity into the bundles constituting the ‘‘body’’ of filopodia [ 17 ] . In both structures , the barbed ( i . e . , the fast growing ) ends of actin filaments point towards the plasma membrane [ 18 ] . Most cultured animal cells assemble both lamellipodia and filopodia . Some cells , like dendritic cells , are dominated by filopodia [ 16 ] while keratocytes grow exclusively lamellipodia [ 19 ] . It is still not fully understood what determines the in vivo preference to lamellipodia vs . filopodia , and why certain cells are dominated by only one type of structure . So far , two mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of filopodia [ 20 ] . In the ‘‘ de novo filopodia nucleation’’ model , actin filament nucleation and elongation is mediated by Dia2 proteins [ 15 , 21 ] . According to this mechanism bundles do not emanate from lamellipodia and Arp2 / 3 complex is not essential for filopodia formation . In the second mechanism , known as the ‘‘convergent elongation’’ model , filopodia emerge from the Arp2 / 3 lamellipodial network [ 22 – 25 ] . During formation of filopodia , lamellipodial filaments associate at their barbed ends with mDia2 or VASP , elongate continuously and gradually converge into PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 September 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e3297 filopodia bundles , by the cross - link of fascin . In contrast to the first mechanism , here filopodia are anchored to lamellipodia . Both systems can be reconstituted in vitro . This work primarily focuses on the ‘‘convergent elongation’’ model . Notwithstanding recent advances in understanding the dynamic organization of lamellipodia and filopodia protrusions , it is still not fully understood how cells control the transition between these structures , what directs the localization of filopodia formation along the cell leading edge , and how their thickness is regulated . It is expected that the emergence of filopodia from lamellipodia would be strongly affected by the properties ( e . g . , the density and length of filaments ) of the branched lamellipodial network from which they emanate . The concentration of Arp2 / 3 , which strongly affects these structural properties , was recently observed to have a dramatic influence on the formation of filopodia in vivo [ 25 ] . The abundance of fascin , which is the driving force for bundling is also expected to affect bundles formation . Yet , it is still not clear how the structure of lamellipodia and the fascin concentration control filopodia formation . To resolve these issues , it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia and evaluate the factors controlling their structure and dynamics . To this end , in the present work we study a system containing the major proteins participating in the assembly of lamellipodia and filopodia : a ) the constitutively active VCA [ 26 ] ( or WA [ 8 ] ) domain of WASp ; b ) Arp2 / 3 complex ; c ) fascin , and d ) actin monomers . This model system enables us to control the concentrations of the various proteins , and to observe actin organization in bulk . Recently , we have demonstrated the feasibility of using such a simple reconstituted system for studying the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia - like structures in vitro [ 27 ] . In this early work , the roles of Arp2 / 3 complex and fascin in the transition from the Arp2 / 3 branched network to filopodia - like bundles was addressed only briefly . Also , no attempt was made to model this transition nor to resolve the primary factors controlling the bundling process . Our goal in the present work is to study in detail the self - assembly characteristics of actin in the presence of variable amounts of Arp2 / 3 complex and fascin . We will show that in the absence of fascin , actin organizes into dense 3D , aster - like , structures composed of branched networks of actin filaments [ 27 ] . The growth of the network advances with the barbed ends of the peripheral actin filaments pointing on average outward , as also demonstrated in the simulations [ 27 ] . Addition of fascin leads to the formation of star - like structures , where actin / fascin bundles are nucleated and emanate radially from the branched network core . The polarity of the actin filaments during the transition is preserved , as in the transition from lamellipodia to filopodia [ 27 ] . Our experiments show that in the early stages of actin polymerization , Arp2 / 3 mediates the formation of the dense and highly branched aster - like network , whereas fascin is rather passive . Fascin becomes dominant at a later stage of actin polymerization , when the ( sparsely branched ) filaments in the periphery of the aster become long enough , so that the energy gained due to actin - fascin - actin links between neighboring filaments overcomes the unfavorable bending energy required to bring them into contact . As time evolves the initially thin bundles elongate , thus lowering their bending energy thereby enabling their association into thicker bundles , and so on until no more actin monomers are left . This picture of stepwise bundle elongation and thickening underlies our structural - energetic model of bundle formation and growth . Using reasonable approximations for the bending energies of actin filaments and bundles , and the cohesive energy due to fasin - actin bonds we can explain the dependence of the thickness and length of the mature bundles upon [ Arp2 / 3 ] . More explicitly , using Kinetic Monte Carlo ( KMC ) simulations we can model the nucleation and growth of asters and derive their structure as a function of time thus obtaining two central structural parameters : the length , L , of filament tips at the aster periphery , and the spacing , b , between their origins ( i . e . , their pointed ends , anchored at Arp2 / 3 branch points ) . These parameters , which determine the initial conditions at the onset of bundling , depend sensitively on [ Arp2 / 3 ] . As we shall see , our theoretical scheme , which combines the KMC and the stepwise bundle assembly model , accounts adequately for the experimentally observed dependence of bundle structure on the initial concentration of Arp2 / 3 in the system . Results The first part of this section describes the three types of structures , i . e . , asters , stars and network of bundles ( a phase of actin - fascin bundles ) that were experimentally observed and the transition between them . We also present a phase diagram of the system to illustrate the regions of existence of the three types of structures as a function of the initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] and [ fascin ] . In the second part , we focus specifically on the transition from asters to stars , as it mimics the transition from lamellipodia to filopodia in cells . Special attention is given to evaluating the roles of [ Arp2 / 3 ] and [ fascin ] on filopodia formation and dimensions . In the last part of this section we describe our theoretical model for bundle assembly and apply it to explain our experimental results . Fascin mediates structural transition of actin self - assembly First , we aimed at studying the self – assembly of actin in the presence of increasing amounts of fascin , at a given [ Arp2 / 3 ] . At low Arp2 / 3 complex concentration of 6 . 25 nM ( the [ VCA ] / [ Arp2 / 3 ] ratio was kept equal to two in all experiments ) two structural transitions are observed , the first , from ‘asters’ to ‘stars’ , and the second , from ‘stars’ to ‘network of bundles’ ( Fig . 1 ) . At a very low fascin concentration ( 3 nM ) the structure of actin network is dominated by Arp2 / 3 nucleation and branching activity – the system organizes into diffuse highly branched 3D aster - like structures ( Fig . 1a ) , similar to those formed in the absence of fascin [ 27 ] . Surprisingly , a minute concentration of fascin ( [ fascin ] = 4 nM ) was sufficient to mediate the nucleation and growth of bundles emanating from branched asters’ cores . Fig . 1b shows such a star - like structure after reaching final dimensions . The bundles grow with their barbed ends pointing outward , as previously demonstrated [ 27 ] . The time span of this process ranges between few to ten minutes , depending on [ Arp2 / 3 ] and [ fascin ] ( data not shown ) . In this work all the experimental data analyses were performed for systems that have reached their final state . Gradual addition of fascin , from 0 . 005 to 0 . 2 m M , increases the number of bundles emanating from the asters core as well as their length ( Figs . 1c – 1f ) . Above 0 . 2 m M of fascin , the system is dominated by the bundling activity of fascin . Most of the actin appears to be located in actin / fascin bundles residing in the bulk solution ( see image background , Fig . 1g ; [ fascin = 0 . 5 m M ] ) . The stars that still exist are composed of fewer and shorter bundles . Eventually , at high enough [ fascin ] ( 3 m M ) stars no longer form ; instead , a network of actin / fascin bundles is generated ( Fig . 1h ) . [ Arp2 / 3 ] controls fascin ability to induce structural changes Structural transformations mediated by fascin seem to be facilitated when the initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] was reduced . The top and bottom panels in Fig . 2 distinguish between fluorescence microscopy images corresponding to mixtures containing low Arp2 / 3 Network Control Bundles PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 September 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e3297 ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 12 . 5 nM ) and high ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 100 nM ) initial Arp2 / 3 contents , respectively . In both cases [ fascin ] varies in the same manner . Initially , at a very low [ fascin ] of 3 nM ( Figs . 2a and 2e ) , actin organization is fully dominated by Arp2 / 3 complex activity ; diffuse asters are formed , whose number increases with the initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] . These asters are smaller and their branched actin cores are denser ( Fig . 2e ) compared to those formed at the lower [ Arp2 / 3 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . Increasing the concentration of fascin to 6 nM ( blue arrow ) induced a transition from asters to stars when [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 12 . 5 nM ( Fig . 2b ; Figs . S1a and S1b show that the transition occurs between 5 nM and 6 nM of fascin ) . On the other hand , 6 nM fascin is not sufficient to induce bundle formation in the [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 100 nM system ( Fig . 2f ) . In this latter case , more fascin ( 7 nM ) is required to nucleate bundles from the branched network core ( see also Figs . S1c and S1d ) . Further addition of fascin induces the formation of additional and longer bundles , resulting in the appearance of fully developed stars , as shown in Figs . 2c and 2g . The total number of bundles nucleated per star in the low [ Arp2 / 3 ] ( 12 . 5 nM ) case appears to be larger than in the high [ Arp2 / 3 ] ( 100 nM ) case . Moreover , the bundles in the low [ Arp2 / 3 ] system look both thicker ( i . e . , they comprise a larger number of actin filaments ) and longer . Clearly Figure 1 . Phase transition as a function of fascin concentration . Conditions are 7 m M G - actin , 6 . 25 nM Arp2 / 3 , and 12 . 5 nM GST - VCA . Fascin concentration is : ( a ) 3 nM , ( b ) 4 nM , ( c ) 5 nM , ( d ) 7 nM , ( e ) 50 nM , ( f ) 200 nM , ( g ) 500 nM , and ( h ) 3 m M . At very low concentrations of fascin asters are formed . Transition to star - like structures occurs above a fascin concentration of 4 nM ( b ) . The density and the length of the bundles emanating from the star core increase with fascin concentration ( b – f ) . Above a certain fascin concentration of 0 . 5 m M ( g ) the size and the number of stars decreases ; the stars coexist with an entangled network of actin / fascin bundles , seen in the image background . At 3 m M stars do not form anymore ; the system is composed solely of entangled network of actin bundles ( h ) . Bar is 10 m m . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0003297 . g001 Figure 2 .

Transition from aster to stars and from stars to network : occurs between 3 to 6 nM and between 0 . 2 to 3 m M at 12 . 5 nM [ Arp2 / 3 ] ( blue and red arrows , respectively ) . At 100 nM [ Arp2 / 3 ] only the transition from aster to star is visible ; transition to a network structure is not visible in these fascin concentration ranges .

Finally , when the amount of fascin was further elevated to 3 m M ( red arrow ) , a transition from ‘stars’ to ‘a network of bundles’ was observed in the 12 . 5 nM Arp2 / 3 system ( Fig . 2d ) . In contrast , the system with 100 nM Arp2 / 3 remained unchanged ( Fig . 2h ) and did not show any structural transition up to 6 m M fascin ( data not shown ) . Actually ‘networks of bundles’ did not appear in any of the systems containing more than 25 nM of Arp2 / 3 complex , regardless of [ fascin ] . In Fig . 3 we present a phase diagram of the system , depicting the regions of existence of the three types of experimentally observed structures , as a function of the initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] and [ fascin ] . The data shown here corresponds to experiments conducted at [ G - actin ] = 7 m M ; a similar qualitative behavior was observed for the other concentrations of actin we have tested , ranging between 1 m M and 5 m M ( data not shown ) . Careful inspection shows that below 3 nM of fascin only aster - like structures form ( circles ) , regardless of [ Arp2 / 3 ] . Increasing [ fascin ] , for a given amount of Arp2 / 3 complex , induces structural transitions into stars ( inverted triangles ) . The amount of fascin required to mediate this transition increases nonlinearly with [ Arp2 / 3 ] , saturating above 40 nM Arp2 / 3 , ( the blue curve marks the approximate boundary between the two regions ) . While only few nano - molars of fascin are sufficient to induce the transition from asters to stars , the subsequent transition to ‘networks’ ( squares ) requires much larger amounts of fascin ( several m M ; the red curve marks the approximate boundary between the two regions ) . We note that a transition to ‘networks’ is observed only for sufficiently low [ Arp2 / 3 ] ( , 25 nM ) , within this region , the amount of fascin required for the nucleation of bundles increases monotonically with Arp2 / 3 content . Aster to star transition – Experimental results The densities of asters and stars depend on [ Arp2 / 3 ] but not on [ fascin ] . To test our assumption that each star originates from a preformed aster , we have measured the number of ‘‘aggregates’’ ( i . e . , asters or stars ) per unit area ( surface density ) , within the 1 m m section of the bulk sample observed . The surface density of aggregates s = d 2 2 was evaluated by measuring the average distance , d , between adjacent aggregates . Keeping a constant ratio [ VCA ] / [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 2 , we have measured d 2 2 for several values of the initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] and [ fascin ] ( Fig . 4 ) . For clarity we present only two concentrations of fascin : 5 nM ( triangles ) and 0 . 2 m M ( circles ) . Data points taken at 5 nM fascin correspond to density of asters , while those taken at 0 . 2 m M fascin are associated with density of stars . In both cases , d 2 2 increases monotonically with [ Arp2 / 3 ] . In contrast , [ fascin ] does not appear to affect d 2 2 ( see inset ; conditions : [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 12 . 5 nM ) , indicating that the density of aggregates is dictated primarily by the amount of Arp2 / 3 complex in the system . These results support our previous findings that Arp2 / 3 complexes are aster nucleators and that stars develop from preformed asters [ 27 ] . This is consistent with our present conclusion that , at early times , actin polymerization is governed by Arp2 / 3 nucleation and branching . Fascin comes into play and becomes dominant in star formation only later , when the structural properties of the aster enable the onset of filament bundling . The length of bundles in stars depends on Arp2 / 3 and fascin concentrations . For all the concentrations of Arp2 / 3 that we have tested , the mean final length of bundles , L Fin , was found to increase with [ fascin ] , reaching asymptotically a maximal ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] dependent ) value , L max Fin ( Fig . 5a ) . The system appears more sensitive to fascin addition when [ Arp2 / 3 ] is lower ( as reflected by the steeper slopes in Fig . 5a ) . Consequently , the amount of fascin required to reach L max Fin decreases with the Figure 3 . Phase diagram for actin - fascin - arp2 / 3 complex . Condition is : 7 m M G - actin , Arp2 / 3 complex and fascin concentration was changed according to the graph . Condition for images is : 3 nM , 200 nM and 3 m M fascin ; 6 . 25 nM , 12 . 5 nM and 6 . 25 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( a , b and c , respectively ) . Experimental points demonstrate different type of structures formed ; these are represented by squares - entangled network , triangles - stars and circles - asters . Phase changes from asters to stars ( blue line ) and from stars to entangled bundle network ( red line ) . Lines of phase separation are plotted as averages of two points of different structures . For low concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex phase transition is more abrupt for the same change in fascin concentration . No transition to entangled network was visible for high concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0003297 . g003 Figure 4 . The surface density of objects ( asters or stars ) is controlled solely by Arp2 / 3 and not by fascin .

The [ VCA ] / [ Arp2 / 3 complex ] = 2 in all experiments . We observe a monotonic growth in density of objects with Arp2 / 3 complex concentration . The density of objects doesn’t show a dependence on fascin concentration ( inset , a half log plot is given in order to see clearly all experimental data points ) . Error bars represent standard deviation from average values . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0003297 . g004 Arp2 / 3 Network Control Bundles PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 September 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e3297 decrease in [ Arp2 / 3 ] . In contrast , for a fixed concentration of fascin , we found that L Fin decreases monotonously with [ Arp2 / 3 ] , ( as seen for [ fascin ] = 100 nM in Fig . 5b ) . The inverse correlation between L Fin and [ Arp2 / 3 ] results from the reduced amount of actin monomers available for bundle growth when [ Arp2 / 3 ] is increased , as discussed in more detail in the theory section below . Theoretical model and analysis Bundle formation : A simple model and Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations . Our experiments show that upon mixing actin monomers with Arp2 / 3 complex , VCA and fascin molecules , the first structures to appear in solution are dense and highly branched aster - like networks of actin filaments [ 27 ] . The asters grow radially outwards , and since Arp2 / 3 joins both old and newly formed filaments , the density of branching points and hence also of polymerized actin is highest in the center of the aster , decreasing gradually towards its periphery , where the average spacing between adjacent branches is relatively large [ 27 ] . To associate into bundles , nearby filaments are generally required to bend towards each other . Inside the aster core , owing primarily to excluded volume interactions between the rigid , dense and highly branched network , filament bending involves a prohibitively large energetic penalty and bundle nucleation is thus highly unlikely . Bending the filaments emanating from the surface of the aster is easier , yet two conditions must be fulfilled to enable the onset of bundle formation . First , L , the average length of the filament tips in the aster periphery , should be larger than the distance , b , between their pointed ends ( which mark their origins ) . The second requirement is that the energy gained due to fascin links between neighboring filaments should exceed the bending energy associ - ated with bringing them into contact . Both conditions are met at some time t i , in the late stages of aster growth , owing mainly to the decrease in [ Arp2 / 3 ] and hence the increase in L . Qualitatively , this explains why in the early stages of actin polymerization the ( dense aster - like ) structure of the actin network is dominated by Arp2 / 3 , with fascin playing a rather passive role . However , once the peripheral filaments are long enough , fascin comes into play – linking the filaments into bundles , whereas branching essentially ceases ; especially along and within the bundles , because the ( already largely depleted ) Arp2 / 3 complexes cannot penetrate the dense bundle . Our goal in this section is to explain the experimental observation that bundles are thicker and longer when the initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] is low ( see Figs . 2 and 5 ) . Qualitatively , this behavior is understood based on the fact that since Arp2 / 3 is an aster nucleator , so that for a given concentration of G - actin , higher [ Arp2 / 3 ] results in the appearance of more asters in solution . Thus , on average , fewer actin monomers participate in the growth of each aster . Also , since the asters formed are denser , fewer monomers are later available for bundle growth , resulting in relatively short bundles , as observed in our experiments ( Figs . 2 and 5 ) . It should be noted that in living cells , the plasma membrane also affects the length of filopodia , as was previously analyzed theoretically [ 23 , 28 ] . Furthermore , in our system , owing to the large energy penalty associated with the bending of short bundles towards each other , and because the bending energy increases rapidly with bundle thickness ( see below ) , when [ Arp2 / 3 ] is high , association of bundles is energetically costly , and the mature bundles are both shorter and thinner than in the case of low [ Arp2 / 3 ] . The structural properties of the asters at the onset of bundle formation , primarily the distances b and L defined above , enter our model as input parameters . Numerical estimates of these quantities were derived using our 3D KMC simulations of aster growth . To derive the aster structural characteristics relevant to the experiments reported here , we have used a limited version of the simulation , which includes only actin polymerization and Arp2 / 3 mediated branching [ 27 ] , ( see also Appendix S1 , in ‘‘Supporting informa - tion’’ ) . A simulation snapshot of an aster is shown in Fig . 6a . It should be noted that ( at least presently ) these simulations do not account for filament bending , and thus cannot describe bundle formation ; they are used here only to provide the initial L and b . At the onset of the aster - to - star transition the radius of the aster is generally much larger than both b and L . Since bundles are formed by the association of neighboring filaments whose origins are just a few b ’s apart , we ignore the curvature of the aster’s surface and treat it as being planar . It may be noted , however , that once bundles become much larger than the aster core , surface curvature correction should ( and can ) be taken into account . Assuming that all the M filaments participating initially in bundle formation are of the same length L , and organize into M / N identical bundles , each of which consists of N filaments , the total energy of the system is given by E tot = ( M / N ) E bundle ( N ; L , b ) . The bundle energy E bundle ( N ; L , b ) includes the cohesive energy due to the fascin - mediated linking of filaments , the bending energy cost of bringing the filaments into contact , and the ( unfavorable ) surface energy of a finite size bundle . All these contributions depend on N , Figure 5 . Mean star - like bundles’ length , L Fin , dependence on the [ Arp2 / 3 ] and [ fascin ] . ( a ) Conditions are : [ G - actin ] = 7 m M ; [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 6 . 25 nM ( green dots ) , 25 nM ( blue dots ) , and 100 nM ( red dots ) . For all three cases , the mean bundles’ length , L Fin , increases with [ fascin ] . ( b ) Conditions are : 7 m M G - actin ; 100 nM fascin and variable amounts of Arp2 / 3 complex . The data shows that the average of bundles length , L Fin , decrease with [ Arp2 / 3 ] monotonically ( error bars are 6 SD ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0003297 . g005 Arp2 / 3 Network Control Bundles PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 September 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e3297 and parametrically on L and b ( Additional contributions , such as the entropy loss experienced by the filaments upon bundling can be neglected ) . If bundle elongation were slow compared to filament ( and bundle ) binding - unbinding events , then the optimal bundle size N * could be derived by minimizing E tot with respect to N . Using reasonable models for the bending , cohesion and surface energies one can show that the resulting N * is indeed larger when [ Arp2 / 3 ] is lower . It must be noted , however , that in this scheme the optimal size and length of bundles is determined by the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics . However , kinetic estimates of the rates of bundle dissociation ( based on calculations of filaments dimerization time , [ 29 , 30 ] ( data not shown ) indicate that once bundles are formed , their life time is significantly longer than the time scale of actin polymerization , so that filament and bundle associations are practically irreversible on the time scale of our present experiments . Based on this notion we propose here an alternative , stepwise , mechanism whereby single filaments first associate into thin bundles ( Fig . 6b ) . The nascent thin bundles are hard to bend , but after elongating their bending and hence fascin - mediated association into thicker bundles becomes easier . This scenario may continue , leading to stepwise bundle thickening . It should be noted that in vivo observations of bundles roots also indicate that bundles initiate in a gradual process of elongation and thickening [ 5 ] . In our in vitro experiments , this process terminates when there are essentially no more actin monomers in the system . Suppose for simplicity that all possible bundles have a circular cross section consisting of a central straight filament surrounded by s concentric shells of filaments ; s = R / d where R is the radius of the bundle , and d is the average distance between adjacent filaments . Fig . 6c shows D E dim ( s ) , the energy change corresponding to the dimerization of two bundles of the same size s containing N < p s 2 filaments , into a thicker bundle comprising 2 N filaments . This simplified calculation ignores many association processes other than bundle doubling ( e . g . , monomer - dimer , monomer - tetramer binding , etc . ) Yet , it captures , at least qualitatively , the kinetic - energetic picture of bundle growth . Results are shown for two of the initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] studied experimentally ( 12 . 5 and 100 nM ) , and several representative values of L which , according to our aster growth simulations , represent relevant filament lengths for the time and concentration scales of the experiments . More specifically , the range of L considered is L min ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] ) , L , L max ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] ) , where L min ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] ) is the length of filaments at the time t i , marking the onset of bundling , and L max ( [ Arp2 / 3 ] ) is the length of bundles when all G - actin was consumed . Our simulations show that there are about 10 6 free monomers per aster at t i ( see methods ) when [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 100 nM , compared to , 10 8 monomers for 12 . 5 nM . In both cases , the number of filaments in the aster periphery is about 5000 at t i . Thus L ranges between 0 . 8 – 1 . 2 m m for 100 nM Arp2 / 3 . In the 12 . 5 nM Arp2 / 3 L is much larger : 1 . 5 – 30 m m . Figure 6 . Analytic Model and KMC simulations emphasize the role of Arp2 / 3 in determining the thickness of bundles . ( a ) .

Fig . 6c shows , for instance , that for [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 12 . 5 nM , bundles of length 9 m m that are composed of 5 shells of filaments will not associate with each other . However , once their length increases to , say , L = 12 m m , they tend to stick to each other since D E dim becomes negative . From Fig . 6c we note that for both values of [ Arp2 / 3 ] considered , as L increases thicker bundles become energetically favorable ; the optimal bundle thickness ( correspond - ing to the minimum of D E dim ( s ) ) increases as well . For example , in the case [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 12 . 5 nM , when L = 9 m m dimerization is favorable for bundles comprising no more than s = 4 shells , and the highest energetic gain is obtained upon dimerization of bundles comprising of s = 2 shells . On the other hand , when L = 12 m m , the maximum number of shells in bundles capable of dimerization to is s = 5 , and the optimal thickness is obtained for doubling s = 3 bundles . Fig . 6c also reveals the important role of [ Arp2 / 3 ] on the length and thickness of the bundles . When [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 100 nM a larger fraction of actin monomers ( as compared to the case [ Arp2 / 3 ] = 12 . 5 nM ) are consumed during aster’s assembly , leaving less monomers for bundle growth . This fact , as well as the initial b and L , are responsible for the shorter and thinner bundles corresponding to the high [ Arp2 / 3 ] system , ( see magnified box ) . In this case , the typical bundle consists of a small ( s , 1 ) number of shells . To derive the results shown in Fig . 6c we expressed the dimerization energy as a sum of bending and fascin linking energies : D E dim = E bend + D E fascin , both depending on s . To calculate the bending energy of a bundle upon joining another one we have used a simple geometrical model , whereby its bent portion , of length l , is represented as composed of two oppositely ( and moderately ) bent , but otherwise identical arcs , joining smoothly each other to an s - like shape ( as may be seen in Fig . 6b ) . It can be shown that this implies E bend = c a 2 / l 3 ( details will be published elsewhere ) . Here a is the distance between the origins of the bundles ( a = bs for two neighboring bundles of size s ) , c = 32 j kT where j is the persistence length of the bundle , k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the absolute temperature . Since fascin is abundant in the system , the actin filaments within bundles are tightly bound , and the bundles thus behave as semiflexible rods of thickness s , and persistence length j s = p 2 s 4 j 1 , where j 1 < 10 m m is the persistence length of a single actin filament . The energy change upon linking two bundles is proportional to the length , L - l , of their straight and parallel portions ( Fig . 6b ) , i . e . , D E fascin = 2 ( L 2 l ) e , where e is the gain , per unit length , in the cohesive energy due to the fascin - F - actin bonds . Assuming that all possible actin - fascin contacts are saturated , and that actin filaments are hexagonally packed within a bundle , we find that for two cylindrical bundles which associate into a thicker cylindrical bundle e = 0 . 2 p s e 1 , where e 1 = 833 kT / m m is the binding energy of fascin to a unit length of a single F - actin . Minimizing D E dim = c b 2 s 2 / l 3 2 ( L 2 l ) e with respect to l , we find the optimal length of the bent ( ‘root - like’’ , Fig . 6b ) portion of the bundle : l s = a b 1 / 2 s 1 / 2 , where a = ( 3 c / e ) 1 / 4 . Substituting l s into D E dim ( s ) we get D E dim ( s ) = C A s 9 / 4 2 C B Ls where C A ~ 5 : 2 e 3 = 4 1 j 1 kT ð Þ 1 = 4 b 1 = 2 and C B = 0 . 2 pe 1 . We conclude this analysis by noting that from some point in time onwards , the bundles observed experimentally appear to continue elongating without changing their thickness . Based on our model we may conclude that this happens when the time scale of bundle bending fluctuations which lead to bundle - bundle association becomes long compared to the experimental time scale , or simply long relative to the time it takes to all actin monomers to join the growing bundles . Discussion In this work we studied in detail the steady state structures formed in a simple in vitro system , in which Arp2 / 3 complex and fascin compete on their binding to actin filaments . Varying mixtures of actin , Arp2 / 3 , and fascin were analyzed in order to elucidate their delicate interplay in determining which of the structures – asters , stars , or networks of bundles – appear in a given concentration regime . We found that in the absence or at very low concentration of fascin the system is dominated by Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation and branching activities , resulting in the appearance of dense 3D aster - like networks of actin . Increasing fascin concentration induces phase changes , first to stars and then to network of bundles . A star is composed of a dense aster core with actin / fascin bundles emanating radially from its surface . Our experiments show that in the early stages of actin polymerization fascin is passive , while Arp2 / 3 mediates dense aster - like structures of actin , whose structure is very similar to the one observed in the absence of fascin . Fascin comes into play when actin filaments in the periphery of the aster get long enough , and can thus bend and associate with each other into bundles of parallel filaments , held together by fascin linkers . This is in accordance with in vivo experiments that emphasize the importance of filaments length in the creation of filopodia [ 16 ] . The aster - star transition appeared for all Arp2 / 3 concentrations that we have tested . The second transition , from stars to network of bundles , has only been observed at sufficiently low [ Arp2 / 3 ] . In conclusion , we find that the system is more sensitive to phase changes when [ Arp2 / 3 ] is low , and the concentration of fascin necessary to induce structural transformations is lower . The competition between Arp2 / 3 and fascin is critical in determining the actin structures formed . This is because these two proteins are nucleators of different actin geometries ; Arp2 / 3 complex promotes the formation of branched actin seeds [ 8 ] while fascin initiates unbranched bundle seeds [ 31 ] . The ability of fascin to nucleate actin bundles in vitro , was recently demonstrated in experiments showing that fascin enhances actin polymerization by promoting the formation of stable disc - like bundle nuclei . These nuclei are composed of short filaments ( a few monomers long ) , which serve as seeds for subsequent actin polymerization [ 31 ] . In the presence of Arp2 / 3 , this process competes with branch nucleation of actin . The rates of these two processes are expected to be regulated by the abundance of Arp2 / 3 complex and fascin . In formulating our model for bundle formation and growth we assumed that only filaments originating at the surface of the aster take part in this process ( similar to in vivo systems where filopodia originate in the vicinity of the plasma membrane ) . Filaments from the inner core of the aster cannot significantly contribute to this process , owing to severe excluded volume interactions on the bending of these highly branched , dense , and entangled filaments . We assumed that bundles begin to form when filaments in the aster surface are long enough so that their bending energy penalty is compensated by the gain of actin - fascin linking energy . Since the unbinding time of bundles is significantly longer than the polymerization time of filaments , their association is essentially irreversible , and thus cannot be adequately described based on thermodynamic equilibrium consideration . We have thus pro - posed a step - wise mechanism of irreversible assembly of single filaments / bundles into thicker bundles , followed by their elonga - tion . The newly formed bundles elongate until their bending energy decreases , and their net association energy into a thicker bundle becomes energetically favorable , etc . This model can also explain the gradual thickening of newly formed bundles in vivo , forming L - precursors shaped roots [ 5 ] . In our experimental Arp2 / 3 Network Control Bundles PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 September 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e3297 system , the elongation - thickening sequence terminates when all actin monomers are consumed . Based on this picture we could explain why at low [ Arp2 / 3 ] the bundles emerging from the aster’s core are both longer and thicker as compared to those observed in systems with a higher initial [ Arp2 / 3 ] . The evolution of asters to stars is of direct biological relevance because of its similarity to lamellipodia to filopodia transition in cells . Recall that two structural parameters , L and b , characterize the periphery of aster’s network . In our in vitro system , the length , L , of the ( unbranched sections of the ) surface filaments increases in time , while the spacing between their origins decreases . In living cells , analogous structural parameters may determine the condi - tions favoring the formation of filopodia . In the cellular system , filaments length ( L ) and the density of the lamellipodial network ( characterized by b ) is controlled by specific regulatory proteins , such as Arp2 / 3 complex , VASP and Dia2 . In particular , Dia2 was recently shown to be recruited to lamellipodia , where it induces the formation of many long , unbranched filaments ( thus locally increasing L and reducing b ) , which then gradually converged into filopodial bundles [ 24 , 32 ] . This behavior is qualitatively consistent with our model , according to which an increasing L or decreasing b , favors the onset of bundle formation . By recruiting proteins like Dia2 to specific sites along lamellipodia , such a mechanism may enable the cell to control the localization of filopodia along its leading edge . To conclude , using a minimal model system containing only Arp2 / 3 complex , actin and fascin we were able to mimic complex events which take place at the leading edge of cells . Compared to a cell this system is simple and easily controlled , making it possible to characterize the roles of a limited set of proteins in the higher order assembly of actin filaments . In the future , it will be interesting to measure the size of the actin / fascin bundle using high resolution electron microscopy , and correlate it with the properties of the aster network structure ( e . g . , density of the actin network , filament length and orientation at the aster periphery ) . It is worthwhile to test the effects of mDia2 and capping proteins concentrations on bundle formation and dimensions . Finally , quantitative information from in vivo studies will be of great value , especially regarding the correlation between filopodia thicknesses and structural properties of the lamellipodial network .
