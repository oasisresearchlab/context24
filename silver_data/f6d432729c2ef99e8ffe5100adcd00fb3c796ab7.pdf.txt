Three main technology attributes have been considered : ( i ) the level of establishment , ( ii ) the scope of appli - cation , and ( iii ) the technological breadth . We have then developed three hypotheses about the in ﬂ uence exerted by these characteristics and have chosen the green energy as the ﬁ eld of investigation . The analysis is based on a sample of 4363 green energy patents registered by PROs at the United States Patent and Trademark O ﬃ ce in the 1976 – 2011 period . The results of a set of Tobit regression have revealed that the level of establishment , the scope of application and the technological breadth of public environmental technologies are positively related to the technological development of an industry . Hence , these ﬁ ndings can help advance the current debate on whether the green outputs of public research can stimulate ﬁ rms to generate environmental technologies . 1 . Introduction The need to reduce human - induced climate changes , while avoiding shrinking economic growth is crucial to maintain sustainable economic growth ( EC / EACI , 2011 ; OECD , 2012 ) . In order to achieve this win - win e ﬀ ect , the development of technological solutions that favour the creation of and at the same time address environmental issues has be - come of foremost importance ( Alkemade et al . , 2011 ; Ghisetti et al . , 2015 ; Mowery et al . , 2010 ) . Green energy technologies ( i . e . , alternative energy production and energy conservation solutions ) are of utmost importance in this respect . On the one hand , since energy production and consumption account for two - thirds of the world ' s greenhouse - gas ( GHG ) emissions ( OECD / IEA , 2015 ) , “ e ﬀ ective action in the energy sector is essential to tackle the climate change problem ” ( OECD / IEA , 2015 : 20 ) . On the other hand , greening the energy sector is necessary to create new business opportunities ( OECD , 2012 ) . The invention , adoption and di ﬀ usion of green energy technologies should therefore be at the core of a sustainability transition in order to replace the current dirtier technologies , improve environmental protection , and boost the economy ( Benson and Magee , 2014 ; Geels et al . , 2016 ; OECD / IEA , 2015 ) . However , market failures often hamper the capabilities of ﬁ rms to capture the full economic return of their environmental R & D activities ( Mowery et al . , 2010 ) , which are subject to the so - called double ex - ternality problem ( Ja ﬀ e et al . , 2005 ; Rennings , 2000 ; Popp et al . , 2010 ; Hoppmann et al . , 2013 ) . In other words , environmental R & D activities lead to two types of positive externalities , that is , knowledge creation and environmental bene ﬁ ts ; nonetheless , neither are well captured by market prices ( Rennings , 2000 ) . As a result , only a suboptimal number of green energy technologies would be generated by the industrial sector in the absence of a proper regulatory push ( e . g . Ja ﬀ e and Palmer , 1997 ; Johnstone et al . , 2012 ) , thus making governmental intervention essential to compensate for this misalignment ( Foray et al . , 2012 ; Ghisetti and Pontoni , 2015 ) . The recent increase in public research organisation ( PRO ) spending on environmentally friendly energy solu - tions is seen as a means to compensate for such sub - optimal investment ( Albino et al . , 2014 ; Hargadon , 2010 ) and may be explained by both neoclassical and evolutionary economic theories . As far as the former are concerned , the public funding of PROs ( e . g . , universities , public research centres , governmental organisations ) may compensate for market failures and generate new technological solutions that i ) would not be developed by private research alone and ii ) may be of use to as many ﬁ rms as possible to generate related technological advancements . Instead , as far as the evolutionary economic theory is concerned , the availability of new technologies developed by PROs would not auto - matically lead to the setting of the basis for the development of https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . techfore . 2019 . 04 . 007 Received 9 August 2018 ; Received in revised form 18 January 2019 ; Accepted 9 April 2019 ⁎ Corresponding author at : European Commission , Joint Research Centre ( JRC ) , Via E .

In fact , ﬁ rms are often not always willing and / or able to draw on public research outcomes because of their weaker connection to market needs or a lack of ﬁ rms ' absorptive capacity ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ; Salter and Martin , 2001 ) . Con - sequently , the degree to which ﬁ rms bene ﬁ t from the research e ﬀ orts of PROs has yet to be fully understood ( Coccia and Rolfo , 2008 ; Cohen et al . , 2002 ) , and this knowledge can be used to improve the e ﬀ ec - tiveness of public investments in producing research externalities for the industrial sector ( Beise and Stahl , 1999 ; Bornmann and Marx , 2014 ) . The present paper aims to be part of this debate and it deals with an application to the green energy ﬁ eld . In fact , its focus is not on the public incentives that may stimulate private environmental R & D ( R & D tax credits , R & D subsidies , etc . ) , as is the case for most of the existing research ( e . g . , Hoppmann et al . , 2013 ) , but is instead on whether and under which conditions the knowledge underlying green energy tech - nologies created by PROs spills to ﬁ rms intensively and whether it boosts a ﬁ rm ' s contribution towards technological development . The empirical analysis has drawn on a sample of 4363 patents re - gistered by PROs during the 1976 – 2011 period at the United States Patent and Trademark O ﬃ ce ( USPTO ) and has labelled them as en - vironmentally based on their International Patent Classi ﬁ cation ( IPC ) code . The results , obtained through Tobit regressions , have revealed that the level of establishment , the scope of application , and the tech - nological breadth of public environmental technologies all have a po - sitive e ﬀ ect on the degree to which the industrial sector builds on green public knowledge for further technological development . The remainder of the paper is structured as follows . Section 2 pre - sents the theory and hypotheses . Section 3 outlines the methodological approach , while Section 4 shows the results . Finally , Section 5 provides the discussion , implications , limitations and future research directions . 2 . Theory and hypotheses The paper assesses whether and to what degree companies build upon the technological knowledge generated by PROs , ultimately sti - mulating an industry to generate new ( environmental ) technologies . To the best of our knowledge , this is still an underdeveloped area of re - search . A recent exception is that of from Popp ( 2017 ) , whose con - tribution has shed light on the value of knowledge ﬂ ows between academia , the private sector and governmental research by means of US patent data which were used to answer questions about whether quality science has been useful for future technology development in the green energy ﬁ eld ( namely biofuels , solar and wind ) and about which in - stitutions produce the most valuable research . His ﬁ ndings suggest the importance of public institutions in increasing the impact ( citations ) on renewable energy research and in helping new energy technologies overcome barriers to their exploitation ( Mowery et al . , 2010 ) . Our contribution adds to the above work by conducting a speci ﬁ c investigation on the nature of the attributes of the green energy tech - nologies developed by PROs . Since the evolutionary economic theory recognises that not all the technologies developed by the public sector a ﬀ ect the industrial domain ( Bornmann and Marx , 2014 ; Coccia and Rolfo , 2008 ; Cohen et al . , 2002 ) , this paper attempts to understand what types of PRO technologies lead to the technological development of industry . Technologies are not all equal and , depending on their attributes , they may be more ( or less ) attractive to and useful for ﬁ rms ( see , e . g . , Chen et al . , 2011 ; Shane , 2001 ) . Such an investigation would allow more light to be shed on how the outputs of PRO research can help the transition to more environmentally friendly R & D e ﬀ orts in the industrial sector , a transition which would require high levels of in - vestment for the development of environmental technologies and thus riskier research activities that are unlikely to be sustained by the private sector on its own ( Mowery et al . , 2010 ) , given the double externality features of such research activities ( Rennings , 2000 ) . It will be argued that , depending on the technology attributes , not only may the technologies developed by PROs be attractive to di ﬀ erent extents to ﬁ rms , but they may also facilitate the transition of ﬁ rms to - wards more environmentally friendly research activities , hence over - coming the double externality problem . Therefore , according to the previous discussion , the main research question of this study is : how does the research generated by PROs impact the technological development of industry in the green energy ﬁ eld ? In other words , we question whether the attributes of the technological knowledge generated by PROs can explain if , and to what extent , such knowledge impacts the industry technological development of industry . The technology attributes under investigation were selected on the basis of a review of the existing literature on technology management ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2011 ; Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ; Nerkar and Shane , 2007 ; Shane , 2001 ; Sohn et al . , 2013 ) and of the emerging lit - erature on environmental technology development ( e . g . , Popp , 2006 ; Popp et al . , 2010 ; Nemet , 2012 ; Guan and Yan , 2016 ; for a review , see Barbieri et al . , 2016 ) . By focusing on the role of knowledge ﬂ ows from PROs as a de - terminant of a ﬁ rm ' s technological development , the paper contributes to the current debate on the conditions under which the outcomes of public environmental research can stimulate the generation of more environmentally friendly technologies by industry , which is becoming more and more important to promote economic growth and address environmental issues ( Alkemade et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , an alter - native perspective is provided to evaluate the societal impact of public environmental research which , although di ﬃ cult for governments to undertake , is necessary to better design e ﬀ ective funding policies ( Bornmann and Marx , 2014 ) . 2 . 1 . Technology attributes Hereafter , we argue that the attributes of the ( environmental ) technologies created by PROs can predict whether public research will set the basis for a ﬁ rm ' s further technological development in the case of such technology - intensive industries as the energy sector . In fact , technology attributes re ﬂ ect the opportunities and knowledge base that characterise technological solutions ( Shane , 2001 ) . These attributes may explain to what degree ﬁ rms build upon certain types of technol - ogies , since they choose technologies for subsequent development on the basis of their expectations for the future and their ability to exploit them ( Nerkar and Shane , 2007 ; Shane , 2001 ) . Technology attributes of PRO green energy technologies re ﬂ ect the public environmental knowledge and opportunities available to ﬁ rms that can be drawn on for subsequent technological development . Those attributes might thus alleviate / strengthen the double externality problem , mainly by fos - tering ( or hampering ) the intentions of ﬁ rms to acquire the initial en - vironmental knowledge needed for their research activities , but not internally developed by them , given the impossibility of capturing its full value . After reviewing the extant literature on technology management and environmental technology drivers , three attributes have been identi ﬁ ed , namely ( i ) the level of establishment ( Heeley and Jacobson , 2008 ) , ( ii ) the scope of application ( Novelli , 2015 ) and ( iii ) the tech - nological breadth ( Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ) . The level of es - tablishment re ﬂ ects to what extent technologies are known and their underlying knowledge has been exploited ; the more ( / less ) known and exploited the technologies are , the more established ( / nascent ) they can be considered ( Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ; Heeley and Jacobson , 2008 ) . The scope of application refers to the extent of di ﬀ erent domains a technology is related to , i . e . , a higher scope re ﬂ ects a broader set of potential applications ( Gambardella et al . , 2007 ; Lerner , 1994 ) . Finally , technological breadth captures the extent to which the knowledge base of a technology is diversi ﬁ ed , thus re ﬂ ecting a wider search process during its development ( Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ) . From a technology management perspective , it has been proved that such attributes may point out if and how a ﬁ rm relies on related L . Ardito , et al . Technological Forecasting & Social Change 144 ( 2019 ) 25 – 35 26 ( public ) technologies , for instance by explaining the likelihood of ﬁ rm formation ( Shane , 2001 ) , technology selling / acquisition ( Nerkar and Shane , 2007 ; Sohn et al . , 2013 ) and the commercialisation of en - vironmental technologies ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , some stu - dies have revealed that the three selected attributes a ﬀ ect the techno - logical impact of patents ( e . g . , Fischer and Leidinger , 2014 ; Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ; Sterzi , 2013 ) - i . e . , the impact of a patent on the development of any related and subsequent patents ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) - even in the case of green energy technologies ( Nemet , 2012 ) . As far as the setting under examination is concerned , the develop - ment of green energy technologies involves technological knowledge that covers a long time period and / or is subject to a faster ( or slower ) exploitation process ( Nemet , 2012 ) , hence highlighting the need to investigate the level of establishment of PRO technologies . Further - more , the green energy sector may a ﬀ ect multiple industries ( e . g . , transportation , waste management , and energy production ) and the respective technological development may rely on multiple knowledge domains ( Benson and Magee , 2014 ; Guan and Yan , 2016 ) , given the complexity that characterises such solutions ( Carrillo - Hermosilla et al . , 2010 ) , which are usually more distant from the traditional sectorial knowledge base ( De Marchi , 2012 ) . Accordingly , Popp and Newell ( 2012 ) outlined that alternative energy technologies are more general than dirtier technologies , serve multiple sectors and are hence cited more often than other technologies . Furthermore , clean energy in - novations are found to create more knowledge spillovers than dirtier innovations ( Dechezleprêtre et al . , 2014 ) , so that their inventions are more pervasive and applicable than dirtier ones . It has recently been con ﬁ rmed that environmental technologies di ﬀ er signi ﬁ cantly from non - environmental ones under multiple attributes ( e . g . , originality , radicalness and generality ) , including their scope ( Barbieri et al . , 2018 ) . As far as the latter aspect is concerned , the higher a patent scope is , the greater the complexity of an invention , the higher the number knowl - edge components it would draw upon ( Lerner , 1994 ) . Green technolo - gies have in fact been found to draw on more dispersed technological ﬁ elds and knowledge components than other technologies ( Barbieri et al . , 2018 ) . Overall , this evidence would seem to suggest the need to investigate the energy technology realm to assess the e ﬀ ect of the selected tech - nology attributes on the generation of green knowledge , given the speci ﬁ cities and di ﬀ erences from standard technologies . 2 . 1 . 1 . The level of establishment Prior research suggests that established technologies may positively impact subsequent technological development , since they are more codi ﬁ ed than novel ones , and hence require an lower level of absorptive capacity ( Dosi and Nelson , 2010 ; Heeley and Jacobson , 2008 ) . Thus , it is easier and more cost - e ﬀ ective for ﬁ rms that have not developed so - lutions to build on established technologies with fewer risks . Second , a better understanding of a given technology provides ﬁ rms with more chances to come up with useful recombinant opportunities , which may then act as a catalyst for the generation of new technologies ( Fleming , 2001 ; Savino et al . , 2015 ) . Third , the exploitation of established tech - nologies is legitimated more by the operating market , because custo - mers usually consider them as more familiar ( Story et al . , 2014 ) . The evidence that green energy technologies that are more radical ( espe - cially in a systemic vision ) and at their initial stage are considered by ﬁ rms as less reliable and / or more costly than dirtier and already es - tablished solutions ( Oltra and Saint Jean , 2009 ) is particularly relevant for the energy sector . This perception , in turn , increases the rigidity of the energy regime , which makes the entry and switching costs of less established green energy technologies higher ( Geels et al . , 2016 ; Wainstein and Bumpus , 2016 ) , so that , in the absence of policy stimulus ( including PRO innovations ) , technological lock - in and path depen - dence may lead ﬁ rms and the market to favour established ( and dirtier ) solutions for future economic activities ( Oltra and Saint Jean , 2009 ) . Thus , the argument is that the higher the level of establishment of a PRO technology is , the more likely it is to in ﬂ uence a ﬁ rm ' s own R & D e ﬀ orts in the green energy ﬁ eld . According to evidence collected for “ standard ” technological solu - tions , this positive e ﬀ ect deteriorates after a certain threshold , as a technology loses its potential exploitability ( U - shaped e ﬀ ect ) ( e . g . , Capaldo et al . , 2017 ; Ardito et al . , 2016a ) . Notwithstanding this , we do not expect to experience any inverted U - shaped e ﬀ ect in the green energy realm . In fact , we argue that the energy sector faces certain speci ﬁ cities that make the level of establishment of PRO technologies positively and linearly supportive of the technology development of an industry . These speci ﬁ cities are the high path dependency of the energy sector ( see , e . g . , Oltra and Saint Jean , 2009 ) and the evidence that industrial economies have su ﬀ ered from a lock - in e ﬀ ect pertaining to “ fossil fuel - based energy systems ” , which were augmented by the co - evolution of technological and institutional settings that were path dependent , to the advantage of dirtier technologies ( Unruh , 2000 ) . This is what has happened , for instance , in the automotive sector , in which the persistent dominant design of the more conventional engine tech - nology ( internal combustion regime ) has led to continuous and incre - mental improvements to this technological path in order to make ve - hicles greener ( more e ﬃ cient and sustainable ) , at the expense of the less established technological path of alternative engine technologies ( such as electric batteries , fuel cells , or hybrid vehicles ) ( Oltra and Saint Jean , 2009 ) . Consequently , the transition to greener energy technolo - gies is less mature and needs longer , so that no detrimental e ﬀ ect of the level of establishment may be expected . Therefore , PROs that aim at providing research externalities to industry may have a greater chance of attracting several companies , if they continue with the initial im - provement of a certain green energy technology , instead of providing completely new solutions . In this way , they help ﬁ rms rely on green energy solutions that might be relevant for the future objectives of the ﬁ rms , but without the necessity of making them in - house , thus limiting the in ﬂ uence that the double externality problem has on the engage - ment of ﬁ rms in environmentally friendly R & D activities ( Hoppmann et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we expect that : H1 . The level of establishment of public environmental technologies has a positive e ﬀ ect on the related technological development of industry . 2 . 1 . 2 . The scope of application Recent research has revealed that non - innovating companies are more likely to build on technologies with a broad scope of application than on innovating ones ( Novelli , 2015 ) . Innovative ﬁ rms in fact usually fail to protect and exploit broad technologies , because they do not have the complementary assets or internal capabilities required to pursue developments across all the potential domains in a timely manner ( Gambardella and Giarratana , 2013 ; Rosenberg and Trajtenberg , 2004 ) . On the other hand , given the high visibility of broad technologies , many non - innovating companies may come across them during their respective search processes and focus on the domain in which they are more expert or which needs a speci ﬁ c contribution to solve an ongoing issue ( Lee and Lee , 2010 ; Novelli , 2015 ) , and hence develop follow - up inventions that substitute the original ones . This in turn implies that the broader the technological solutions developed by PROs are , the more likely ﬁ rms will be to come across those solutions and build on them . In other words , the scope of a technology signals its pervasiveness , and the higher this pervasiveness is , the more likely it is that relevant innovations will be developed , as occurs in the case of General Purpose Technologies ( GPTs ) ( Bresnahan and Trajtenberg , 1995 ) . The literature on GPTs shows interesting patterns that can par - tially be extended to this context , and which support the need to ana - lyse technology attributes in depth . GPTs are currently bene ﬁ ting from the recombination of knowledge from diverse knowledge areas , and their development is being a ﬀ ected by the technological attributes of L . Ardito , et al . Technological Forecasting & Social Change 144 ( 2019 ) 25 – 35 27 the knowledge they build upon ( Appio et al . , 2017 ) . The analysis of a patent ' s attributes ( of any technology ) may help to discern and predict whether it could become a transformative GPT or not ( Feldman and Yoon , 2011 ) . Technology attributes themselves a ﬀ ect the likelihood of their sustaining ( or not ) the di ﬀ usion of GPTs and the e ﬀ ects of GPTs on subsequent long - run economic growth ( Andergassen et al . , 2017 ) . The role played by this pervasiveness may be accentuated in the ( green ) energy sector because it is related to multiple domains ( e . g . , building , transportation , waste management and energy production ) ( OECD , 2012 ) . Therefore , a number of di ﬀ erent companies can en - counter a green energy technology with a broad application scope . Furthermore , the adoption of broad PRO technologies with en - vironmental bene ﬁ ts may increase the competitiveness of ﬁ rms . These solutions may be sources of competitive advantage for ﬁ rms who build on existing technologies to develop new ones that expand existing ( environmental ) knowledge bases ( De Marchi , 2012 ) without the costs associated with their internal development and , hence , going beyond a ﬁ rm ' s core competencies ( Teece et al . , 1997 ) . Moreover , even though several companies build on the same broad environmental technology , it may still be a source of competitive advantage , since not all the companies will adopt the technology on the same market or for the same application , given its pervasive nature . This is the case , for in - stance , of LED lighting technologies , which are considered important solutions within the energy conservation umbrella ( WIPO , 2012 ) . In fact , these technologies have been adopted by several ﬁ rms in di ﬀ erent kinds of industries ( e . g . , illumination , television , computers , and car manufacturing ) to develop more energy e ﬃ cient products , whose launching would have been hampered ( or prevented ) without the R & D programmes of some PROs , such as “ LED lighting facts ” by the US Department of Energy . 1 The foregoing discussion supports the hy - pothesis that : H2 . The scope of application of public environmental technologies has a positive e ﬀ ect on the related technological development of industry . 2 . 1 . 3 . The technological breadth Technologies resulting from wide searches are more likely to be understood by companies operating in di ﬀ erent industries ( Banerjee and Cole , 2010 ) . This indicates that more companies may build on solutions with higher technological breadth . Accordingly , environ - mental technologies , such as energy ones , are multi - faceted in nature ( Markard et al . , 2012 ) and are more systemic than standard innovations ( Carrillo - Hermosilla et al . , 2010 ) . Consequently , they may serve to spur further technological advancements . Moreover , the various companies that attempt to build on technologies with a high technological breadth may bene ﬁ t from a large pool of potential links and associations be - tween various knowledge domains , and this may in turn lead to more opportunities for knowledge recombination ( Maggitti et al . , 2013 ) and , hence , more chances of contributing to technological development ( Fleming , 2001 ; Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ) . Such recombinant opportunities are particularly relevant to allow ﬁ rms to build on green energy technologies . Green energy technologies , based on multiple knowledge domains , are more likely to set the basis for future tech - nological developments ( Benson and Magee , 2014 ; Nemet , 2012 ) and thus they have a higher impact as they may be used to solve diverse technological problems while addressing environmental concerns ( Ardito et al . , 2016b ) . The work of Noailly and Shestalova ( 2017 ) , who pointed out that renewable energy patents in general broadly serve external knowledge development , is an interesting example , as one - third of their citations came from technology ﬁ elds other than power generation . More speci ﬁ cally , the authors established what external technology ﬁ elds build most on the knowledge developed within the renewable energy ﬁ eld and found interesting speci ﬁ cities : solar patents are mainly cited for semiconductors , thermal processes and apparatus , and civil engineering ; wind patents for electrical machinery , engines , pumps and turbines , mechanical elements and transport ; storage patents for electrical machinery ; waste and biomass for basic material chemistry , chemical engineering and environmental technology patents . It may be expected that those PROs that combine more knowledge domains during their environmental research processes will ﬁ nd solu - tions of a higher impact on the technological development of industry . In addition , in the same way as for the development of environmental technologies , these bene ﬁ ts have been observed from an open innova - tion mode . In fact , the breadth of external knowledge sourcing has been found to positively in ﬂ uence the rate of adoption of those solutions ( Ghisetti et al . , 2015 ) , since relying broadly on multiple knowledge sources provides ﬁ rms with valuable knowledge ﬂ ows which are later transformed into actual environmental technologies . This is especially true for green energy technologies , for which the lack of external knowledge sourcing in R & D has been found to be a detrimental barrier to their subsequent adoption and exploitation ( Rennings and Rammer , 2009 ) . Therefore , we hypothesise that : H3 . The technological breadth of public technologies has a positive e ﬀ ect on the related technological development of industry . 3 . Data and methodology 3 . 1 . Industry setting The green energy ﬁ eld is a suitable ﬁ eld to test the proposed hy - potheses for many reasons . First , although PROs are usually set up to provide scienti ﬁ c knowledge , their roles as technology providers has gained increasing importance in this speci ﬁ c context ( Albino et al . , 2014 ; Oltra et al . , 2012 ) . Second , patents are widely used to identify and examine green energy technologies ( Guan and Yan , 2016 ; Nemet , 2012 ; Popp , 2017 ; Veugelers , 2012 ) . Moreover , patent data allow several attributes of patented inventions to be identi ﬁ ed and the degree to which they have impacted subsequent technological developments to be established ( Kaplan and Vakili , 2015 ; Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ; Nerkar and Shane , 2007 ) . Patent citations have also been dis - cussed to obtain a good indication of knowledge transfer among in - ventors ( Ja ﬀ e et al . , 2000 ) . Finally , many governments have changed their intellectual property policies to increase incentives for public re - search patenting ( e . g . , the Bayh - Dole Act ) . Consequently , the rate of PRO patenting has increased ( Sterzi , 2013 ) , especially in the green energy ﬁ eld ( Albino et al . , 2014 ; Hargadon , 2010 ) . Therefore , patents can be considered as a reliable information source to conduct the pre - sent research . 3 . 2 . Data collection We ﬁ rst detected technologies developed by PROs in the green en - ergy ﬁ eld by looking into patents registered at the USPTO and by la - belling them as environmental on the basis of the IPC codes pertaining to the “ Alternative energy production ” and “ Energy conservation ” technology ﬁ elds , as de ﬁ ned in the IPC Green Inventory ( WIPO , 2012 ) . All the patents related to the following macro categories : Bio - fuels ; Fuel cells ; Harnessing energy from manmade waste ; Hydro energy ; Wind energy ; Solar energy ; Geothermal energy ; Other productions or uses of heat , not derived from combustion , e . g . natural heat and Using waste heat all belong to the ﬁ rst category . Those patents related to the fol - lowing macro categories : Storage of electrical energy ; Power supply circuitry ; Low energy lighting ; Thermal building insulation , in general and Recovering mechanical energy all belong to the second category . All the patents that matched our search criteria , but were not registered by a research organisation or were applied for after 2011 , were ex - cluded to allow enough time for the patents to be cited ( e . g . Katila , 2002 ) . Finally , websites , reports and other additional sources were 1 See http : / / www . lightingfacts . com / About . L . Ardito , et al . Technological Forecasting & Social Change 144 ( 2019 ) 25 – 35 28 scrutinised to distinguish between patents registered by private and public research organisations . This procedure yielded a ﬁ nal sample of 4363 patents that had only been developed by PROs during the 1976 – 2011 period . The ﬁ nal sample included patents by PROs estab - lished in diverse countries , such as the US Department of Energy , the French Commissariat à l ' énergie atomique et aux énergies , the National Research Council of Canada , the Indian Council of Scienti ﬁ c and In - dustrial Research , and the Taiwanese National Tsing Hua University , which are also among the most patent - intensive public organisations in the world . It is important to stress that our empirical design selected the pa - tents , developed by PROs , which had been taxonomised as belonging to the green energy ﬁ eld in existing classi ﬁ cations as belonging to the green energy ﬁ eld , as detailed before , and not those ﬁ rms or , more generally , the population of actors belonging to the energy sector . In other words , our de ﬁ nition of the green energy sector was driven by the patents ( which constitute our unit of analysis ) and not by the actors active in the energy sectors . This implies that , on the one hand , it has not been possible to perfectly overlap the evidence obtained from looking at aforementioned patents with the evidence regarding the status quo and the overall evolution of the sustainability of the energy sector , which is discussed elsewhere , for instance in recent ad hoc re - ports ( EEA , 2018 ) . On the other hand , we have not restricted our analysis on the subsequent technological development of the sector to actors who necessarily belong to this sector , i . e . we have looked at the industrial use of those patents , generated by PROs , that have been la - belled as being related to the green energy ﬁ eld , regardless of whether the user of those patents is connected to the energy sector or not . 3 . 3 . Variables 3 . 3 . 1 . Dependent variable Forward citations have been widely considered as a proxy for the impact of patents on subsequent technological developments ( Arts et al . , 2013 ; Kaplan and Vakili , 2015 ; Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ) . In fact , “ external citations indicate that other players have internalised part of the knowledge underlying the original invention and succeeded in building on it ” ( Novelli , 2015 : 494 ) . In line with this reasoning , the citations received by the patents in the sample were analysed to assess whether they had been referenced by patents developed by companies , in order to test whether PRO patents have had an impact on the tech - nological development of the related industry . In other words , we identi ﬁ ed the citing patents for each patent in our sample and to whom they belong . Once the owners of the citing patents had been identi ﬁ ed , a distinction was made between those registered by ﬁ rms and those registered by other types of assignees , such as universities and research organisations , single inventors and ﬁ nancing institutions . Finally , after checking the company names , the dependent variable ( In - dustryTechDevelopment ) was built as follows : ∑ ⎜ ⎟ = − ⎛ ⎝ ⎞ ⎠ IndustryTechDevelopment C C 1 , F FP P 2 where C FP indicates the number of times ﬁ rm F cited focal patent P , while C P is the total number of citations of patent P from patents owned by ﬁ rms . This is a Her ﬁ ndahl - type index , which is based on the gen - erality index proposed by Trajtenberg et al . ( 1997 ) . Unlike Trajtenberg et al . ' s ( 1997 ) generality index , this measure does not account for the diverse technological classes of the citing patents ; it instead considers the diverse ﬁ rms that own the cited patents . The rationale behind this index is that the greater the variety of ﬁ rms that own the cited patents is , the higher the impact of the PRO patent on the technological de - velopment of the industry . This variable may alternatively be computed as a simple count of diverse ﬁ rms that own at least one patent which cites a PRO patent . However , in this way , the actual degree to which the PRO patent a ﬀ ects the industrial sector would not emerge . This can be understood by considering the following example : let a patent receive 15 citations equally distributed among patents owned by companies A , B and C , and let a second patent also receive 15 citations , but 13 of them are from patents owned by company A , one citation is from company B , and one citation is from company C . The ﬁ rst invention actually has a wider impact on the industry than the second one , which mainly has an im - pact on company A . In addition , if we adopted a count measure , its value would be the same for the two patents ( three ) . On the other hand , the Her ﬁ ndahl index , IndustryTechDevelopment , would have amounted to 0 . 88 for the ﬁ rst invention and 0 . 24 for the second invention . The latter would better characterise the diverse impact of the two inven - tions , but the former would re ﬂ ect a wider impact . Furthermore , although this study covers a long period of time and there may be a bias towards older patents , in terms of forward citations , we are con ﬁ dent that our measure is still reliable for the following reasons . First , the most recent patents in our sample were ﬁ led for in the year 2011 , with forward citations collected until the beginning of 2017 . Hence , we have captured all the received citations for at least ﬁ ve years after the patent applications , which is considered the time span when patents obtain most of their citations ( e . g . , Griliches , 1987 ; Katila , 2002 ; Nooteboom et al . , 2007 ) . Second , our models include time - period e ﬀ ects to account for systematic intertemporal di ﬀ erences ( see Section 3 . 3 . 3 ) . 3 . 3 . 2 . Independent variables The ﬁ rst independent variable measures the extent to which a technology is established ( Established ) . It is computed as the natural logarithm of the number of a patent ' s backward citations . The loga - rithmic transformation was adopted to correct for skewness and kur - tosis . 2 The rationale behind this measure is based on previous studies that argued that the higher the citations made by a focal patent are , the higher the level of establishment ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ; Ardito et al . , 2016a ; Nerkar and Shane , 2007 ; Ziedonis , 2007 ) . In fact , since a technology is often the result of a cumulative process over a techno - logical trajectory ( Dosi , 1982 ; Dosi and Nelson , 2010 ) , it can be as - sumed that patents that refer to a large number of previous patents re ﬂ ect inventions with a stronger link to a well - established technolo - gical paradigm ( Dornbusch and Neuhäusler , 2015 ; Martinelli , 2012 ) . Conversely , a small number of backward citations signal that a patent is disconnected from previous technical solutions , thus highlighting its novel nature ( Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ; Ziedonis , 2007 ) . Second , ac - cording to the literature in this ﬁ eld , the scope of application ( Scope ) was operationalised as the number of di ﬀ erent three - digit US classes assigned to each patent by USPTO ( Lerner , 1994 ; Novelli , 2015 ) . Fi - nally , in order to assess the breadth of the technological base upon which a patent was built ( TechBreadth ) , Trajtenberg et al . ' s ( 1997 ) originality index was adopted ( see also Arts et al . , 2013 ) . This index is computed through a Her ﬁ ndahl index , which highlights the degree of diversi ﬁ cation , in terms of technological classes , of the patents upon which a focal patent is based ( i . e . the backward citations ) . Speci ﬁ cally : ∑ = − Technological breadth S 1 , ij 2 where S ij refers to the fraction of patents cited for patent i that belong to the three - digit US class j out of n technological categories assigned to the patents by USPTO . 3 . 3 . 3 . Control variables Several control variables were included to improve the reliability of our analyses . First , the scienti ﬁ c nature of the knowledge underlying a patented technology ( Scienti ﬁ c ) was accounted for by counting the 2 The skewness and kurtosis values before the logarithmic transformation were 7 . 78 and 93 . 81 , respectively . After the logarithmic transformation , they decreased to zero and three , respectively . L . Ardito , et al . Technological Forecasting & Social Change 144 ( 2019 ) 25 – 35 29 number of patent references to non - patent documents ( Narin et al . , 1997 ) . Since this variable was skewed and kurtotic , a logarithmic transformation was also used . 3 Second , a dummy variable that assessed whether a patent had been jointly developed by several organisations was included ( value one ) ( Joint ) ( Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ) . Third , we controlled for the number of patent claims ( Claims ) ( Novelli , 2015 ; Reitzig , 2004 ) . Fourth , we accounted for the number of inventors ( Singh , 2008 ) who had been involved in the invention process ( Team - Size ) . Fifth , since a patent may attract the attention of companies , whether it has been published in other patent o ﬃ ces or not , and whether the innovating organisation has been willing to pay renewal fees or not , we took into account the number of patent o ﬃ ces ( besides USPTO ) where the patent had been registered ( PatFamily ) ( Reitzig , 2004 ) and whether the patent renewal fees had been paid at least once ( Renewal ) ( Fischer and Leidinger , 2014 ) . Sixth , we distinguished be - tween PROs from universities , governmental organisations ( e . g . , the U . S . Department of Energy ) and other public research centres ( e . g . , national research councils ) , each of which was represented by a dummy variable . Thus , we included two dummies ( dummy PRO ) to control for the di ﬀ erent types of PRO , with the “ University ” PRO being the benchmark . Seventh , we also included dummy variables to control for relevant time period e ﬀ ects ( dummy period ) . Time ﬁ xed e ﬀ ects were considered for 1976 – 1987 , 1988 – 1997 , 1998 – 2002 and 2003 – 2011 , and the latter was considered as the benchmark . Eighth , we added a dummy variable to assess whether a PRO that owned a patent was US based ( value one ) in order to control for a potential country bias ( dummy US ) . Finally , we included a dummy variable that took on the value of one if a patent was an “ Alternative energy production ” tech - nology ( dummy AEP ) , and zero in the case it referred to an “ Energy conservation ” technology . 3 . 4 . Model speci ﬁ cation Since our focus has been on the technology attributes of an inven - tion , the unit of analysis of this study is a single patent . Speci ﬁ cally , IndustryTechDevelopment has been operationalised through a Her ﬁ ndahl index , which takes on continuous values , ranging from zero to one . Given the double bounded nature of this variable and its non - normal distribution , it falls into the category of limited dependent variables ( LDVs ) ( Long , 1997 ) . Therefore , we employed a Tobit regression ( see , for example , Banerjee and Cole , 2010 ; Köhler et al . , 2012 ) . This type of regression is in fact suitable when the dependent variable is limited to a range of values and is not normally distributed ( Long , 1997 ) . Con - versely , other types of regressions ( e . g . , OLS ) cannot account for the nature of LDVs and tend to estimate incorrect parameters ( Long , 1997 ; Wiersema and Bowen , 2009 ; Wooldridge , 2012 ) . Furthermore , the bias in the ﬁ xed e ﬀ ect estimates , due to the “ incidental parameter problem ” , is attenuated in the case of Tobit models ( Greene , 2004 ) . 4 . Results Tables 1 and 2 show the descriptive statistics and pairwise corre - lations , respectively . According to Table 2 , the correlations are essen - tially low , with the exception of 0 . 66 for Technological Breadth and Establishment , but the maximum variance in ﬂ ation factor for each model is below two , hence signalling the absence of severe multi - collinearity issues ( Cohen et al . , 2013 ) . Table 3 presents the results of the Tobit regression . Model 1 is the baseline model , which only includes the control variables . Models 2 – 4 are the partial models , each of which contains one of the three in - dependent variables . Model 5 is the full model . Model 1 reveals that PRO green energy patents have a wider impact on the industrial sector if the number of claims is high ( β = 0 . 008 , p < 0 . 01 ) , and if they are owned by several organisations ( β = 0 . 057 , p < 0 . 10 ) , have been re - newed at least once ( β = 0 . 244 , p < 0 . 01 ) and the PRO is US based ( β = 0 . 110 , p < 0 . 01 ) . The opposite e ﬀ ect can be ascribed to the re - liance on basic research ( β = − 0 . 081 , p < 0 . 01 ) , team size ( β = − 0 . 011 , p < 0 . 05 ) , and the development of an “ Alternative en - ergy production ” technology ( β = − 0 . 246 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Model 2 tests H1 and suggests that the level of establishment is positively related to IndustryTechDevelopment ( β = 0 . 114 , p < 0 . 01 ) , according to H1 . In line with H2 , Model 3 reveals that the scope of application has a po - sitive impact on the technological development of an industry ( β = 0 . 027 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Finally , Model 4 supports H3 , in that the coe ﬃ cient of TechBreadth is positive and signi ﬁ cant ( β = 0 . 296 , p < 0 . 01 ) . We added the squared term of the independent variable under analysis to establish robustness for each partial model . No squared terms resulted signi ﬁ cant , thus con ﬁ rming the initial hy - potheses ( see Models 2a , 3a , and 4a ) . The full model also corroborated the results of the partial models . In addition , we measured the patent scope considering the number of diverse sub - classes instead of the number of di ﬀ erent three - digit IPC classes . All the hypotheses con - tinued to be supported in this case . 5 . Discussion and conclusion Boosting the development of green energy solutions by the private sector is pivotal for policymakers in order to simultaneously improve economic growth and environmental bene ﬁ ts ( Hoppmann et al . , 2013 ; Rennings , 2000 ) . The aim of public research is to correct market fail - ures ( e . g . , the double externality problem ) while hampering private environmental R & D e ﬀ orts , yet PROs often fail to achieve this goal ( Balachandra et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , it has been pointed out that green technologies di ﬀ er substantially from non - environmental ones , both as far as their nature and their impacts are concerned , not only because of their “ double externality ” nature , but also because they are more complex and have a greater and more pervasive impact on the subsequent related inventions ( Barbieri et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , the present paper has been aimed at understanding under which conditions the research outcomes of PROs in ﬂ uence the tech - nological development of an industry in the green energy sector . To do so , the attributes of PRO technologies ( i . e . , the level of establishment , the scope of application , the scienti ﬁ c nature , and the technological breadth ) have been analysed . A Tobit regression , which was conducted on a sample of 4363 pa - tents registered by PROs during the 1976 – 2011 period , and which were classi ﬁ ed as “ Alternative energy production ” or “ Energy conservation ” technology ﬁ elds , revealed that the level of establishment , the scope of application and the technological breadth had a positive e ﬀ ect on the degree to which many companies will build on PRO research outcomes , thus supporting our conjectures . Considering that “ understanding the impact of public research on industrial R & D is central to understanding the innovation process itself ” ( Cohen et al . , 2002 : 1 ) , these results provide relevant theoretical and policy implications . 5 . 1 . Theoretical implications From a theoretical perspective , this research has investigated a novel and understudied set of antecedents ( i . e . , technology attributes ) that may help explain when the outcomes of public R & D e ﬀ orts in the green energy ﬁ eld provide externalities for the industry sector . To the best of our knowledge , prior research has widely investigated the policy incentives that foster private R & D activities ( e . g . , public subsidies ) ( e . g . , Hoppmann et al . , 2013 ; OECD , 2012 ) , but negligible e ﬀ orts have been devoted to examining situations in which the results of public research have an impact on the industrial sector by explicitly focusing on the same nature of the technological results as this research . 3 The skewness and kurtosis values before the logarithmic transformation were 11 . 57 and 254 . 98 , respectively . After the logarithmic transformation , they decreased to 0 . 68 and 2 . 72 , respectively . L . Ardito , et al . Technological Forecasting & Social Change 144 ( 2019 ) 25 – 35 30 We have revealed that investigating the role of technology attri - butes is relevant to assess the impact of public environmental research on the technological development of an industry , in particular with reference to the green energy ﬁ eld , which has been at the core of academic ( e . g . , Barbieri et al . , 2016 ; Hoppmann et al . , 2013 ) and po - litical debates ( OECD , 2012 ; OECD / IEA , 2015 ) . These technologies present distinctive features with respect to standard technologies , and hence call for ad hoc investigations . Moreover , their role has been proved to be central to move towards a low - carbon society ( Benson and Magee , 2014 ; Nemet , 2012 ) . Notwithstanding this , these studies have not provided insights about the potential in ﬂ uence of technology - level factors , such as technological attributes , to explain whether green en - ergy technologies , developed by PROs , have an impact on the sub - sequent research and technological activities of ﬁ rms . Moreover , among the few studies that have examined the results of public research in promoting R & D initiatives related to the private sector ( e . g . , university - industry - government collaborations and Spin - o ﬀ creation ) ( e . g . , Bruneel et al . , 2010 ; Dornbusch and Neuhäusler , 2015 ) , very few of them have narrowed the level of analysis to the technology level ( e . g . , Shane , 2001 ) , which , instead , has been proved to be pivotal to understand innovation phenomena and the impact of developed technologies ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2011 ; Nerkar and Shane , 2007 ) . In the same way , studies that have examined public - private knowledge transfer have mainly focused on ﬁ rm / university characteristics , modes of knowledge transfer and proximity dimensions ( e . g . , geographic ) ( Agrawal , 2001 ; Azagra - Caro et al . , 2017 ; Lindelöf and Löfsten , 2004 ) . However , except for in the work of Bekkers and Bodas Freitas ( 2008 ) , knowledge speci ﬁ c characteristics ( e . g . , codi ﬁ cation ) have been un - dervalued ; additionally , whether these knowledge characteristics help ﬁ rms improve their innovation processes has remained unclear . These arguments help to point out the relevance of our contribution , which re ﬁ nes earlier works on the in ﬂ uence of public research on the in - dustrial sector by o ﬀ ering empirical evidence about the role of tech - nology attributes . Finally , this study also contributes to the discussion on “ where ” to measure the in ﬂ uence of a ( green ) technology . In fact , a technology may in ﬂ uence the technological landscape in which R & D e ﬀ orts suc - ceed within or beyond a technological , geographic or institutional do - main ( see , for example , Ardito et al . , 2016b ; Messeni Petruzzelli et al . , 2015 ) . In line with this perspective , our results highlight when ( green ) technologies belonging to the public domain have an impact on the industrial sector . These results may be added to the literature on re - search evaluation ( e . g . , Bornmann and Marx , 2014 ; Lyall et al . , 2004 ) . This literature claims that measuring the societal bene ﬁ ts of public research is still a complex task , and we believe our approach may have provided further insights on how to measure the societal impact of public research , in light of its in ﬂ uence on achieving sustainable goals . 5 . 2 . Policy implications From a policy perspective , we have provided guidance on how governments can allocate public funds to develop green energy tech - nologies in order to play a relevant role in the technological develop - ment of an industry . We advise policymakers that the attractiveness of such public technologies is not the same for all companies . Therefore , when it is relevant to produce research externalities for the industrial sector , policymakers should design funding schemes that are devoted speci ﬁ cally to developing explicit types of technical solutions . In turn , it is important that PROs receive clear indications regarding the R & D outcomes they are expected to produce . Therefore , we suggest that policymakers should invest in strengthening their networks with cor - porate executives in the green energy ﬁ eld to obtain a better Table 1 Descriptive statistics .

In this way , the environ - mental and business requirements may be better matched and there will therefore be more chances for governments to supply relevant green energy technologies to the industrial domain , in order to set the basis for their future research activities . More in detail , we have found that green energy technologies that are more established are more likely to have an impact on the tech - nological development of an industry . Although it may appear that this result suggests policymakers should disregard more basic research , we advocate that PROs should instead focus on both basic and applied research . In other words , PROs should continue re ﬁ ning a technology until it reaches a level that may be understandable and usable by companies , without necessarily limiting their e ﬀ orts to the creation of a new solution . This may also help to overcome the double externality problem that private research activities have to face by reducing knowledge leakage and uncertainty . Whether a policy can be designed accurately to this aim , is certainly hard to say . However , we retain that technological knowledge generated by PROs ( be it more established or less established ) can a ﬀ ect the technological development of an in - dustry at two stages ( early and mature ) , and both stages should be stimulated in an appropriate way . On the other hand , sustaining only more established – and mature – technologies , may come at the price of not witnessing a rise in future radical advancements , which may even serve future economic growth by serving as GPTs . Accordingly , the scope of application and technological breadth were both revealed to be core attributes that help make green energy technologies more usable by ﬁ rms . This implies that green technologies that can readily be ap - plied to diverse domains or which are grounded on a knowledge base that enables several recombinant opportunities will likely spread more easily to multiple companies . Therefore , policymakers are advised that developing more pervasive green solutions or green solutions that are based upon broad innovation activities will sustain the related tech - nological development of an industry . 5 . 3 . Limitations Some limitations of the current study could not be solved and have been left for future research . First , although the use of patents to cap - ture technology development is widely di ﬀ used , especially in the green energy ﬁ eld ( Albino et al . , 2014 ; Hoppmann et al . , 2013 ; Popp , 2006 ) , some inventions have not been patented and / or are not patentable . Hence , direct interviews with companies and policymakers would help to close this information gap and would allow the additional char - acteristics of technologies ( e . g . , operational complexity ) that cannot be captured through patent measures to be scrutinised . Second , in this research , we have only focused on the role of technology attributes , given the limited attention they have received , to analyse the impact of public research . However , we acknowledge that organisational - and environmental - level factors might moderate the technology - level re - lationships between the attributes of PRO technologies and the tech - nological development of an industry , and this aspect would require multilevel analyses . Third , although the energy sector has been con - sidered particularly relevant for this research , other green domains could also be investigated to ensure the generalisability of the results . Fourth , a properly designed counterfactual impact evaluation could be an important future extension of the work . It could be aimed at testing whether PRO knowledge would have a greater / less impact on the green energy ﬁ eld than knowledge created elsewhere ( and by how much ) . The current design does not allow such a test to be conducted . Finally , from a purely environmental viewpoint , the analysis and its ﬁ ndings do not necessarily imply a positive environmental impact . In other words , it is not known whether the technology attributes under study posi - tively a ﬀ ect the technological development of an industry at the cost of creating technological lock - ins that hamper the uptake of cleaner technologies . However , this kind of investigation is beyond the scope of the current contribution and deserves further ad hoc investigations .
