De La Cruz , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and accepted by Editorial Board Member Yale E . Goldman December 26 , 2018 ( received for review July 28 , 2018 ) Proteins of the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family are the central regulators of actin filament disassembly . A key function of ADF / cofilin is to sever actin filaments . However , how it does so in a physiological context , where filaments are interconnected and under mechanical stress , remains unclear . Here , we monitor and quantify the action of ADF / cofilin in different mechanical situa - tions by using single - molecule , single - filament , and filament net - work techniques , coupled to microfluidics . We find that local curvature favors severing , while tension surprisingly has no effect on cofilin binding and weakly enhances severing . Remarkably , we observe that filament segments that are held between two anchoring points , thereby constraining their twist , experience a mechanical torque upon cofilin binding . We find that this ADF / cofilin - induced torque does not hinder ADF / cofilin binding , but dramatically enhances severing . A simple model , which faithfully recapitulates our experimental observations , indicates that the ADF / cofilin - induced torque increases the severing rate constant 100 - fold . A consequence of this mechanism , which we verify ex - perimentally , is that cross - linked filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments . We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF / cofilin ’ s ability to sever highly connected filament networks in cells . cytoskeleton | mechanotransduction | actin dynamics | microfluidics A number of essential cellular processes rely on the regulated assembly and disassembly of actin filament networks ( 1 , 2 ) . The main proteins responsible for actin filament ( F - actin ) dis - assembly are the members of the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin protein family ( 3 – 5 ) . ADF / cofilin binds to ADP – F - actin in a cooperative manner , leading to the formation of ADF / cofilin domains ( 6 – 10 ) . These domains make filaments locally more flexible , for both bending and twisting ( 11 – 14 ) , and shorten their right - handed helical pitch ( without changing their length ) ( 15 – 17 ) . Filaments consequently sever at , or near , do - main boundaries ( 8 – 10 , 18 – 25 ) . ADF / cofilin - saturated filament fragments do not sever , since they contain no domain bound - aries , but they depolymerize from both ends . In particular , ADF / cofilin - decorated filaments have barbed ends that can hardly elongate or get capped , and thus depolymerize extensively , even in the presence of monomeric actin or capping proteins ( 10 , 26 ) . We have recently measured the rate constants of these different binding , severing , and depolymerizing reactions ( 10 ) . These results were obtained , as for many in vitro characterizations , by monitoring filaments that were barely constrained mechanically . In contrast , most filaments in cells are part of interconnected , or cross - linked , networks , and are exposed to various mechanical stresses . The specific activity of ADF / cofilin in this context is unclear . Mechanical stress has long been proposed to potentially en - hance severing by cofilin ( 27 – 31 ) . Filaments immobilized on coverslips were reported to sever preferentially in bent regions when exposed to actophorin , a member of the ADF / cofilin family found in amoeba ( 27 ) . Tension has been reported to protect filaments from ADF / cofilin binding and severing ( 32 ) , and so has , very recently , formin - induced filament torsion ( 33 ) . A recent theoretical study proposes that buckled filaments are easier to sever , while twisting a filament would mostly favor the dissociation of cofilin ( 31 ) . In addition to the external application of mechanical stress , seemingly passive mechanical constraints such as filament an - choring may also play a role . For instance , it has been demon - strated that the number of severing events induced by cofilin increased with the density of anchoring points to the coverslip surface ( 34 ) . The authors interpreted their observation by pro - posing that severing was enhanced because anchors made it more difficult for filaments to relax structural strain induced by cofilin binding . In cells as well as in vitro , filaments cross - linked into bundles by fascin have been reported to sever faster than individual filaments when exposed to ADF / cofilin , and several explanations have been proposed , including a contribution of mechanical constraints ( 35 ) . A primary aspect is that , according to structural data , ADF / cofilin domains locally change the helical pitch of actin filaments ( 15 – 17 ) . When filaments are anchored or cross - linked , their overall twist is constrained and this feature thus appears to be in conflict with ADF / cofilin binding . Existing data thus indicate that twist constraints and torque are likely to be key parameters affecting cofilin activity . Whether they contribute to favor or hinder cofilin binding , and / or severing , and to what extent , are all open questions . Significance Actin filaments assemble into ordered networks able to exert forces and shape cells . In response , filaments are exposed to mechanical stress which can potentially modulate their inter - actions with regulatory proteins . We developed in vitro tools to manipulate single filaments and study the impact of me - chanics on the activity of actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin , the central player in actin disassembly . While tension has almost no effect , curvature enhances severing by ADF / cofilin . We also discovered a mechanism that boosts the sev - ering of anchored filaments : When binding to these filaments , ADF / cofilin locally increases their natural helicity , generating a torque that accelerates filament fragmentation up to 100 - fold . As a consequence , interconnected filament networks are sev - ered far more efficiently than independent filaments . Author contributions : H . W . , A . J . , and G .

We show that cofilin generates a torsional stress when binding to twist - constrained filaments , leading to a drastic enhancement of their severing . Results and Discussion Cofilin Binding Appears to Induce a Torsional Stress on Actin Filaments Which Cannot Freely Rotate Around Their Main Axis . To directly assess the effect of ADF / cofilin binding on filament torsion , we monitored the polarization of the light emitted by single labeled actin subunits ( 36 , 37 ) , incorporated within filaments that were anchored by either one or two ends in a microfluidics chamber ( Fig . 1 ) . In the absence of cofilin , the polarization index of labeled subunits fluctuated mildly around a constant value , indicating that these subunits remained pointing in a fixed direction . When exposed to cofilin , the polarization index began to vary , reflecting the rotation of the subunits ’ orientation around the filament ’ s main axis ( for 13 out of 15 , and 12 out of 25 observed subunits on filaments anchored by one or two ends , respectively . Fig . 1 C and D shows subsets of four representative measurements for each condition ) . Variations of the polarization index were more pronounced and more regular when only one filament end was anchored ( Fig . 1 and SI Appendix , Fig . S1 E ) . These observations are in agreement with numerical simula - tions that we performed ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 ) assuming that cofilin - decorated regions have a 25 % shorter right - handed helical pitch ( 15 ) and are 18 - fold more compliant to twist than bare regions ( 11 ) . Filament rotation induced by cofilin binding could be most clearly characterized by monitoring the appearance and growth of a labeled cofilin - 1 domain , between the anchored filament end and a labeled actin subunit ( Fig . 1 E – G ) . Within the reso - lution of our experiment , this subunit began to rotate when the fluorescent signal from the cofilin - 1 domain was first detected between the anchoring point and the subunit . We have calibrated the fluorescence intensity of EGFP – cofilin - 1 , and could thus estimate that one full turn was achieved when 91 ± 32 ( std , n = 10 filaments ) cofilin molecules were bound between the labeled actin subunit and the anchoring point . This number is close to what one would deduce from the reported reduction in the right - handed helical pitch for cofilin - decorated filaments , which leads to an estimated 80 cofilins to cause one full turn . Consistently , we found the rotation velocity of the filaments to be correlated with cofilin concentration , which modulates domain nucleation and growth rate ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) .

Direct visualization of the torsional stress induced by cofilin binding to anchored actin filaments . ( A ) In a microfluidics chamber , filaments with a low fraction of labeled subunits are either polymerized from surface - anchored spectrin - actin seeds ( single anchor , twist is unconstrained ) , or anchored by their sides via biotin – neutravidin bonds ( between two anchoring sites , the twist is constrained ) . ( B ) The polarization of the emitted light indicates the orientation of a single actin subunit . The polarization P = ( I + 45 − I − 45 ) / ( I + 45 + I − 45 ) is determined by measuring the emitted intensity through two different polarization filters ( I + 45 and I − 45 ) . ( C , Top ) For a twist - unconstrained filament , time - lapse of the fluorescent intensities measured for a single actin subunit through the two polarization filters . ( C , Bottom ) Variation of the polarization P over time , measured for a single labeled subunit on four different twist - unconstrained fila - ments . The green curve corresponds to the same subunit as the time - lapse shown above . From time t = 0 onward , 500 nM cofilin was injected . Here only , filaments were polymerized for 15 – 20 min but not aged further . F - actin was partially in a ADP state to slow down cofilin binding ( see SI Appendix , Fig . S2 for full ADP - F - actin ) . ( D ) Variation of the polarization P over time , measured for a single labeled subunit on four different twist - constrained filaments , exposed to 500 nM cofilin from time t = 0 onward . ( E ) Sketched from above : ADF / cofilin binding shortens the right - handed helical pitch and thus rotates the filament segment located between the ADF / cofilin domain and the free barbed end ( BE ) , including subunit 2 , while subunit 1 ’ s orientation does not change . ( F ) Time - lapses of the fluorescent intensities measured in the configuration sketched in E : the two labeled actin subunits , each seen through the two polarization filters , as well as the total intensity of the growing EGFP – cofilin - 1 domain positioned between these two labeled subunits . ( G ) Polarization of the same two labeled actin subunits , compared with the estimated number of cofilin monomers bound between these two subunits . From time t = 0 onward , 250 nM EGFP – cofilin - 1 was injected . On this specific example , subunit 2 ( filled green symbols ) made one full rotation at t ∼ 30 s , when ∼ 60 EGFP – cofilin - 1 molecules had bound the filament . 2596 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1812053116 Wioland et al . These results show that filaments with a free end rotate around their main axis upon cofilin binding , thereby preventing the ap - plication of torsional stress . In contrast , cofilin domains decorat - ing a filament segment between two anchoring points will impose a mechanical torque on this segment : Both bare and decorated regions will be undertwisted relative to their natural helicity ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B ) . Twist - Constrained Filaments Are Severed Faster by ADF / Cofilin . We next sought to examine the consequences of this mechanical torque . To do so , we compared the action of cofilin on filaments held be - tween two anchoring points ( i . e . , twist - constrained , thus experienc - ing a torque as cofilin binds ) with its action on filaments held by a single anchoring point ( i . e . , free to rotate , and thus not subjected to torque ) . These two configurations were achieved simultaneously in the same microfluidics chamber , by anchoring sparsely biotinylated filaments with one flow direction and then exposing them to labeled cofilin - 1 with an orthogonal flow direction ( Fig . 2 A ) . We monitored the increase in the fluorescence signal of EGFP – cofilin - 1 on each population and found that cofilin binds equally fast to twist - unconstrained or twist - constrained filaments ( Fig . 2 C ) . We measured the survival fraction of unsevered filaments in each population ( excluding events observed near the anchoring points ) and found that twist - constrained filaments were severed significantly faster ( Fig . 2 D ) . Severing occurred near domain boundaries , both on unconstrained ( 83 % of severing events , n = 24 ) and constrained filaments ( 93 % of severing events , n = 28 ) ( Fig . 2 B ) . In the absence of cofilin , no significant severing was observed in either population ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . We also verified that , after a severing event on a twist - constrained filament , the two resulting single - anchored filament fragments exhibited the same , lower severing rate as filaments in the twist - unconstrained pop - ulation ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) . The enhanced severing was also observed with ADF or at pH 7 . 0 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 ) . It thus appears that cofilin severing is enhanced by the tor - sional stress induced by cofilin binding to filament segments between two anchoring points . Here , local filament curvature ( which we specifically address in the next section ) does not ap - pear to contribute to this enhancement of severing , because the curvature of double - anchored filaments is very weak ( with a typical curvature radius of more than 10 μ m ; see Fig . 2 B and SI Appendix ) and because these filaments sever at the same rate when no curvature is imposed , in the absence of flow ( SI Ap - pendix , Fig . S7 B ) . Sharp bends can occur near the anchoring points ( Fig . 2 B ) , but these regions were excluded from our analysis . Filament Bending Enhances Severing by Cofilin , While Tension Has Almost No Effect . We next examined if an externally applied stress could alter the severing rate . Due to the helical nature of the actin filament , twist and bending are coupled ( 38 ) and we thus expected sharp filament bends to also enhance severing by cofilin ( 19 , 29 , 31 ) . To test this idea , we anchored short phalloidin - stabilized filaments to the bottom of the flow chamber and , thanks to the flow , we imposed a different direction to the unanchored filaments that elongated from them ( Fig . 3 A ) . We found that larger angular differences between the anchored and free segments , which correspond to higher local curvatures near the anchored segment , led to faster severing by ADF / cofilin in that region ( Fig . 3 A – D ) . We also compared these results to severing on straight filament portions ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 ) .

S6 ) . The flowing solutions also put filaments under tension . When filaments are anchored by a single point , they are exposed to a tension gradient ( 39 ) , which we have modulated up to a maxi - mum tension of 30 pN by varying the flow rate ( SI Appendix and SI Appendix , Fig . S8 ) . We found that the local tension had no effect on the binding of cofilin ( Fig . 3 F and G ) , while severing was slightly favored on regions exposed to the highest tensions ( above 25 pN , Fig . 3 H and I ) . Filaments anchored between two points , perpendicular to the flow , are exposed to a nearly uni - form tension ( SI Appendix ) . On these twist - constrained fila - ments , we observed no effect of tension ( up to 13 pN ) on the cofilin severing rate and severing events were homogeneously distributed ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 B ) . Globally , our results on tension differ from those previously published by Hayakawa et al . ( 32 ) , reporting that both cofilin binding and severing were hindered by filament tension , as low as 3 . 4 pN . To further test our results , we have repeated our ex - periments probing lower force ranges , using different isoforms ( ADF , cofilin - 2 , cytoplasmic actin ) , and anchoring filament barbed ends with gelsolin ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) . These experi - ments all confirmed that , in our assays , filament tension had no significant effect on ADF / cofilin activity . Perhaps our experiments fail to show an effect of tension because they lack some of the conditions used by Hayakawa et al . ( 32 ) , such as the anchoring of filaments to surfaces with inactivated myosins , which may induce specific conformational changes upon the application of force , or the use of rhodamine - labeled actin ( from Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) with a possibly high labeling fraction ( not specified ) , which may give rise to a specific mechanical response of the filament . In cells , there is evidence of a mechanosensitive disassembly of filaments ( 40 ) . In this context , filament tension may affect other factors modulating the activity of cofilin , such as tropomyosins ( 41 ) . A Simple Model Accounts for the Torque - Induced Enhancement of Severing . To further describe and quantify the enhanced sever - ing of twist - constrained filaments by ADF / cofilin , we have re - capitulated our results in the following model ( summarized in Fig . 4 A , and detailed in SI Appendix ) , which we compared with our experimental data thanks to numerical simulations . To ac - count for ADF / cofilin cooperative binding , we assume domain nucleation to follow a quadratic dependence on cofilin concen - tration , and grow with the rate constants that we have previously measured ( 10 ) . When twist is constrained , ADF / cofilin domains nucleate and grow with the same rates as on twist - unconstrained filaments , as indicated by our observations ( Fig . 2 C ) . A simple energy balance also supports this hypothesis : We can estimate spectrin - seed tension gradient 0 max cofilin - 1 domain : 1 2 3 flow severing E 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time ( s ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 F r a c t i on o f un s e v e r ed f il a m en t s < 39° ( N = 21 ) 39° < < 76° ( N = 23 ) > 76° ( N = 21 ) 2 μM ADF C D 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time ( s ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 F r a c t i on o f un s e v e r ed f il a m en t s 15° ( N = 20 ) 45° ( N = 21 ) 1 μM cofilin - 1 0 10 15 20 25 30 Tension ( pN ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 N o r m a li z ed c u m u l a t i v e d i s t r i bu t i on f un c t i on 5 Severing distribution after exposing to 1 μM cof1 for 2s ( N = 86 filaments ) 0 10 15 20 25 30 Tension ( pN ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 N o r m a li z ed s e v e r i ng p r obab ili t y 5 0 . 1 p = 0 . 077 ( n . s . ) p = 0 . 025 H I Tension ( pN ) 0 10 15 20 25 30 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 N o r m a li z ed c u m u l a t i v e d i s t r i bu t i on f un c t i on 5 Domains distribution after exposing to 1 μM mCh - cof1 for 4s ( N = 208 domains ) 0 10 15 20 25 30 Tension ( pN ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 m C h - c o f 1 do m a i n s den s i t y ( / μ m ) 5 0 . 1 p = 0 . 082 ( n . s . ) p = 0 . 055 ( n . s . ) F G A PE anchoredactin segment flow free actin segment BE B = 110° 2 μm 2 μm = 20° t = 0 t = 20s + 2μM ADF BE Fig . 3 . ADF / cofilin - induced severing is faster on bent filaments but barely affected by tension . ( A ) To assess the effect of curvature , a segment of biotin – F - actin is stabilized with rhodamine – phalloidin and left to bind the neutravidin – biotin - poly - L - lysine - PEG surface with a random orientation ( red ) . A second segment , that does not bind the surface , is then polymerized from this seed with Alexa - 488 – actin ( green ) .

The angle θ is defined as the angle between the flow direction and direction of the anchored segment . ( C and D ) ADF / cofilin - induced severing rate is significantly larger on curved filaments . The filament population was split into two or three subsets of equal size and different angle θ . The free filament segment ( green ) was on average 5 . 5 μ m long ( std 1 μ m ) . The flow gradient was kept low ( 300 / s ) , resulting in a tension of about 0 . 2 pN in the curved region .

The growth of a cofilin domain applies a mechanical torque Γ on the double - anchored filament . Using published values of tor - sional stiffness for ( stiffer ) bare and ( softer ) cofilin - decorated F - actin ( 11 ) , we can compute Γ , which is uniform throughout the filaments , as a function of the cofilin coverage ratio ( SI Appendix ) . We find that , due to the greater flexibility of cofilin - decorated regions , this torque rapidly reaches its maximum value ( Fig . 4 B ) . Severing occurs at domain boundaries . Fitting the survival fraction for twist - unconstrained filaments ( Fig . 4 C ) allowed us to determine the zero - torque severing rate constant k 0sev . Since actin is partially labeled here , this severing rate constant is larger than the one we have measured in earlier work on unlabeled F - actin ( 10 ) . We assumed that torque increased the severing rate exponentially , following a modified Bell model : k sev = k 0sev exp ð α Γ = k B T Þ , where α , quantifying the torque sensitivity of severing , was the only unknown parameter and was determined by fitting the ex - perimental survival fractions for twist - constrained filaments ( Fig . 4 D ) . Our model appears to be in very good agreement with our experimental data . We can estimate the maximum cofilin - induced torque to be ∼ 3 . 9 pN nm ( Fig . 4 B ) , based on published values of torsional stiffness , which are on the order of 10 − 27 N m 2 ( 11 ) . Recent computations ( 31 ) indicate that these numbers correspond to intersubunit torsional rigidities and that the filament torsional rigidity would be ∼ 10 - fold larger ( 42 , 43 ) . Our observation , using polarization microscopy , that individual subunits located micro - meters away from the anchored end of the filament have a well - defined orientation ( Fig . 1 ) , appears consistent with these larger values of torsional rigidity . These values would lead to a larger estimate of the maximum torque and thus to a lower value of α , but our conclusion would remain : As cofilin domains nucleate and grow on twist - constrained filaments , they rapidly generate a torque , thereby enhancing the severing rate per cofilin domain . Based on our computations , the severing rate per domain is increased over 20 - fold when 10 % of the filament is decorated by cofilin , 50 - fold when 20 % is decorated , and up to 100 - fold when the filament is nearly saturated by cofilin . However , as in the absence of torque , a fully decorated filament will not sever be - cause it lacks domain boundaries . Constraining a Filament ’ s Twist Allows It to Sever Before Being Saturated by Cofilin . Since severing occurs at the boundaries between cofilin domains and bare filament regions , cofilin - saturated filaments do not sever ( 8 , 10 ) . Thus , a factor that will determine the number of severing events is their ability to occur before the filament is fully decorated by cofilin ( 44 ) . Enhancing severing with torsional stress not only allows it to occur faster , it may also allow it to happen on segments that would otherwise not sever at all . We expected this effect to be more pronounced on short filaments , which are more prone to become saturated without severing . This situation is certainly common in cells , where filament segments between cross - links can be a few hundred nanometers long . However , individual severing events are difficult to resolve at such short length scales in our experiments . Therefore , to investigate and quantify this point further , we have performed numerical simulations using our knowledge of the different reaction rates . We found that the torque - induced amplification of severing indeed allows cofilin to sever filaments in conditions where they would otherwise reach saturation without being severed ( Fig . 4 E ) . The difference is particularly strong for short filaments , which will be faster to saturate with cofilin . Note that , in this race against saturation , the enhance - ment of severing is made particularly effective by the fact that a significant torsional stress is already imposed by low densities of cofilin ( Fig . 4 B ) . Similarly , multiplying anchoring points allows cofilin to break filaments into more fragments ( Fig . 4 F ) . This result explains why severing is more efficient when fila - ments are immobilized on a coverslip densely coated with myo - sins ( 34 ) .

Model for the torque - induced enhancement of severing by cofilin . ( A ) Sketch and summary of the model used for simulations . ( B ) Computed cofilin density and resulting torque on twist - constrained filaments . The experimental curves for cofilin density ( in red and blue ) come from Fig . 2 C . The maximum torque applied on twist - constrained filaments corresponds to an undertwist of ∼ 5 rotations per micrometer . ( C and D ) Fit of the fraction of unsevered fil - aments in free ( C ) and constrained twist ( D ) conditions . k 0sev = 2 . 4 × 10 − 2 s − 1 was determined by fitting the data at 1 μ M cofilin with unconstrained twist , and α = 5 was then determined by fitting the data at 1 μ M cofilin with constrained twist . All other curves were simulated using these same parameters , with no further adjustment . The experimental curves are from Fig . 2 D . Simulations were performed over 50 - fold larger samples of filaments with the same lengths . Shadows represent 95 % confidence intervals ( SI Appendix , Supplementary Methods and Information ) .

We show here that , within our range of concentrations , every filament segment between two anchoring points is likely to be severed before being saturated by cofilin , thanks to this torsional stress . Cross - Linked Networks Sever Much Faster than Unconnected Filaments . Our observations and calculations suggest that the rate and extent of severing by cofilin will be greater in networks of cross - linked filaments than equivalent populations of free filaments . To test this prediction , we have performed experiments on filament net - works in T - shaped flow chambers ( Fig . 5 A ) . Preformed bio - tinylated actin filaments , with a 20 : 1 unlabeled - to - labeled filament ratio , were injected in the short end of the T - shaped chamber , which was then sealed , thereby creating a dead end which contained the filaments . We made similar observations where all of the fila - ments were fluorescently labeled , but having only a fraction of labeled filaments allows one to monitor and quantify single events ( 45 ) . Methylcellulose was present in the buffer , to maintain the filaments close to the passivated surface at the bottom of the chamber , thus forming a dense , quasi - bidimensional filament network . Different solutions could then be flowed in the main channel of the chamber , and their components could diffuse into the chamber dead end , without mechanically perturbing the fila - ment population . We first introduced either a neutravidin solution or buffer in the main channel , to either cross - link filaments or not . In this experiment , the cross - links are thus artificially mediated by biotin and neutravidin , and are certainly stronger than what would be typically encountered in cells . We then flowed a solution of cofilin in the main channel , and observed its impact on the fila - ments . In each experiment , we monitored filaments in the same region of the chamber , 500 μ m away from the channel junction . Upon exposure to cofilin , the fates of the two filament pop - ulations were dramatically different , with the interconnected filaments experiencing far more severing ( Fig . 5 B – D ) . We have quantified the severing events in each population ( Fig . 5 C ) and we can estimate that , shortly after flowing in cofilin , interconnected filaments severed more than 30 - fold faster than nonconnected fil - aments ( with initial severing rates of ∼ 0 . 001 and 0 . 035 events per micrometer per second , for nonconnected and interconnected fila - ments , respectively ) . On longer timescales , when the filaments were saturated by cofilin , many filaments of a few micrometers in length could be observed in the nonconnected network , while only sub - micrometer fragments remained of the interconnected network ( Fig . 5 D ) . By creating new filament ends , severing also promotes the depolymerization of the filaments in the network : 250 s after flowing in cofilin , only 22 % of the cross - linked F - actin remained visible ( the rest being either fully depolymerized or in fragments too small to be detected ) while 73 % of the nonconnected F - actin was still visible . Compared with our single - filament observations , severing appears to take place slower in our network experiment , possibly due to the diffusion and consumption of the finite cofilin pool by the dense actin filament network in the closed , T - shaped micro - chamber [ such a depletion was recently reported in branched actin networks ( 46 ) ] , and to the presence of methylcellulose . None - theless , our experimental observations are in good quantitative agreement with the results of our simulations , which were based on our measured rates and our model ( Fig . 4 ) . From the observed filament density , and taking into account that there were 20 un - labeled filaments for every labeled filament , we could estimate that the cross - link density in our experiment was on the order of 1 μ m − 1 . According to Fig . 4 E we could thus expect that inter - connected filaments would typically experience one severing event per micrometer , while most of the equivalent segments in non - connected filaments will saturate and not sever . This is indeed what we observed : After 200 s , interconnected filaments cumu - lated a bit more than one severing event per micrometer , while nonconnected filaments were still several micrometers long on average ( Fig . 5 C and D ) . Implications for Actin Disassembly in Cells . We show here that torsional stress and bending enhance filament severing by cofilin . These observations are consistent with early reports showing that , in the absence of cofilin , imposing a torque ( 42 ) or sharp bends ( 47 ) to actin filaments makes it easier to break them by applying tension . In our study , however , the torque is applied by cofilin itself as it binds to twist - constrained filaments , and the resulting torque is enough to dramatically increase the severing rate at the boundaries of cofilin domains . In cells , where fila - ments are typically interconnected and are not free to rotate , this mechanism is likely to play an important role . In particular , since its consequences are more drastic on densely connected fila - ments , it may modulate the disassembly of filament networks based on their cross - link density . In cells , additional effects may come from the application of a torque to actin filaments by other factors . A recent theoretical study predicts that undertwisting an actin filament , beyond the maximum of ∼ 5 rotations per micrometer that cofilin can induce on its own , would lead to an enhancement of cofilin dissociation , and that overtwisting would have a stronger effect ( 31 ) .

Enhanced severing of interconnected actin filament networks . ( A ) Experimental setup , using T - shaped chambers , seen from above . A solution of biotinylated F - actin , containing one fluorescently labeled filament for 20 unlabeled filaments , was first injected in the short channel . The filaments could either be left nonconnected ( Top , blue ) or be cross - linked by injecting neutravidin through the main channel ( Bottom , red ) . Cofilin - 1 ( unlabeled ) was then injected in the main channel and F - actin severing was observed in the same region 500 μ m away from the channel junction .

These results suggest that formin - induced torque can reach higher values than the cofilin - induced torque we report here , and future studies will be needed to further explore the specificities of the different means to apply a torque to actin filaments . The enhancement of severing by a cofilin - induced torque is a very general mechanism since all it requires is for filaments to be constrained in twist . This situation arises whenever filaments are anchored , or cross - linked , regardless of the molecular nature of the cross - links , even though the strength of the cross - linking bonds is likely to modulate the global outcome . Our results are sufficient to explain why severing by cofilin is enhanced when filaments are bundled by fascin ( 35 ) . Consistently , when fila - ments are bundled by a crowding agent , without cross - links that would constrain their twist , no enhancement of severing is ob - served ( 48 ) . Other factors , specific to different cross - linkers , may also modulate severing , in addition to the generation of a torque . For instance , severing may be further enhanced by cofilin dis - continuities due to its competition with cross - linkers , or by local changes in stiffness due to the presence of cross - links ( 21 ) . Bulky cross - linkers ( 49 ) or very tight filament packing may also alter cofilin ’ s access to the sides of the filaments . The torque generated by the binding of cofilin onto twist - constrained filaments may also affect the binding of other reg - ulatory proteins , such as tropomyosins ( 41 , 50 ) or Aip1 ( 9 , 23 , 51 ) , and thereby modulate the competition or the cooperative binding of these proteins . Cofilin - induced torque on inter - connected filaments is thus likely to have consequences beyond the enhanced severing we report here , and may play an essential regulatory role in cells .
