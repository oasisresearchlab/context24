Moore * Molecular Virology Program , University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute , University of Pittsburgh , 5117 Centre Avenue , Suite 1 . 8 , Pittsburgh , PA 15213 , USA Abstract Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals , a feature suggestive of an infectious origin . We studied MCC samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus T antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase . Further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387 - base - pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV or MCPyV ) . MCV sequences were detected in 8 of 10 ( 80 % ) MCC tumors but only 5 of 59 ( 8 % ) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 ( 16 % ) control skin tissues . In six of eight MCV - positive MCCs , viral DNA was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern , suggesting that MCV infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells . Thus , MCV may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of MCC . Polyomaviruses have been suspected as potential etiologic agents in human cancer since the discovery of murine polyoma virus ( MuPyV ) by Gross in 1953 ( 1 ) . However , although polyomavirus infections can produce tumors in animal models , there is no conclusive evidence that they play a role in human cancers ( 2 ) . These small double - stranded DNA viruses [ ∼ 5200 base pairs ( bp ) ] encode a variably spliced oncoprotein , the tumor ( T ) antigen ( 3 , 4 ) , and are divided into three genetically distinct groups : ( i ) avian polyomaviruses , ( ii ) mammalian viruses related to MuPyV , and ( iii ) mammalian polyomaviruses related to simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) ( 5 ) . All four known human polyomaviruses [ BK virus ( BKV ) , JCV , KIV , and WUV ( 6 , 7 ) ] belong to the SV40 subgroup . In animals , integration of polyomavirus DNA into the host genome often precedes tumor formation ( 8 ) . Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) is a neuroectodermal tumor arising from mechanoreceptor Merkel cells ( Fig . 1A ) . MCC is rare , but its incidence has tripled over the past 2 decades in the United States to 1500 cases per year ( 9 ) . It is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer ; about 50 % of advanced MCC patients live 9 months or less . Gene expression profiling studies indicate that MCC may comprise two or more clinically similar diseases with distinct etiologies ( 10 ) . Like Kaposi’s sarcoma ( KS ) , MCC occurs more frequently than expected among immunosuppressed transplant and AIDS patients ( 11 ) . These similarities to KS , an immune - related tumor caused by KS - associated herpesvirus ( 12 ) , raise the possibility that MCC may also have an infectious origin . To search for viral sequences in MCC , we used digital transcriptome subtraction ( DTS ) , a methodology we developed that can identify foreign transcripts by using human high - To whom correspondence should be addressed . yc70 @ pitt . edu ( Y .

Published in final edited form as : Science . 2008 February 22 ; 319 ( 5866 ) : 1096 – 1100 . doi : 10 . 1126 / science . 1152586 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t throughput cDNA sequencing data ( 13 ) . We generated two cDNA libraries from a total of four anonymized MCC tumors . One library was prepared with the use of mRNA from a single tumor ( MCC347 ) , and the other was prepared with mRNA pooled from three tumors ( MCC337 , 343 , and 346 ) to increase the likelihood of detecting rare viral sequences ( table S1 ) . From these two libraries , we respectively pyro - sequenced 216 , 599 and 179 , 135 cDNA sequences ( ∼ 150 to 200 bp ) . These 395 , 734 cDNA sequences were trimmed with LUCY stringency equivalent to PHRED scores of 20 or higher ( 14 ) . Copolymers of adenine or thymidine [ poly ( A ) and poly ( T ) , respectively ] , dust ( low - complexity ) , human repeat , and primer adaptor sequences were then removed , leaving 382 , 747 sequences to form a high - fidelity ( HiFi ) data set . Of these , 380 , 352 ( 99 . 4 % ) aligned to human RefSeq RNA , mitochondrial , assembled chromosomes , or immunoglobulin sequences in National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) databases . Of the remaining 2395 HiFi candidate sequences , one transcript ( DTS1 ) from MCC347 cDNA aligned with high homology to African green monkey ( AGM ) lymphotropic polyomavirus ( LPyV ) and to human BK polyomavirus T antigen sequences . A second DTS transcript ( DTS2 ) had no homology to deposited polyomavirus sequences but was subsequently identified by aligning HiFi candidates to the full - length viral genome ( see below ) . These two sequences define a previously unknown human polyomavirus that we call Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV or MCPyV ) because of its close association with MCC . Rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( 3 ′ - RACE ) extended DTS1 to three different cDNAs ( Fig . 1B ) : One transcript terminated at a poly ( A ) site in the T antigen sequence , and two cDNAs read through this weak poly ( A ) site to form different length fusions with intron 1 of the human receptor tyrosine phosphatase type G gene ( PTPRG ) ( GenBank : 18860897 ) on chromosome 3p14 . 2 . Viral integration at this site was confirmed by sequencing DNA polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) products with the use of a viral primer and a human PTPRG primer . The same three RACE products were independently cloned from MCC348 , a lymph node metastasis from the MCC347 primary tumor , indicating that this tumor was seeded from a single tumor cell already positive for the T antigen - PTPRG fusion transcript . By viral genome walking , we sequenced the complete closed circular genome of MCV ( 5387 bp , prototype ) from tumor MCC350 . A second genome , MCV339 ( 5201 bp ) , was then sequenced by using MCV - specific primers . The sequences of MCV350 and MCV339 have GenBank accession numbers EU375803 and EU375804 , respectively . Both viruses encode sequences with high homology to polyomavirus T antigen , VP1 , VP2 / 3 , and replication origin sequences ( Fig . 2A ) . MCV has an early gene expression region [ 196 to 3080 nucleotides ( nt ) ] containing the T antigen locus with large T and small T open reading frames and a late gene region containing VP1 and VP2 / 3 open reading frames between 3156 and 5118 nt . The T antigen locus has features conserved with other polyomavirus T antigens , including cr1 , DnaJ , pRB1 - binding Leu - X - Cys - X - Glu ( LXCXE ) motif , origin - binding , and helicase / adenosine triphosphatase ( ATPase ) domains . Mutations in the C terminus of MCV350 and 339 large T open reading frames are predicted to truncate large T protein but are unlikely to affect small T antigen protein expression . The replication origin is highly conserved with that of other polyomaviruses and includes features such as a poly ( T ) tract and conserved T antigen binding boxes ( fig . S1 ) . MCV has highest homology to viruses belonging to the MuPyV subgroup and is most closely related to AGM LPyV ( Fig . 2B ) ( 15 ) . It is more distantly related to known human polyomaviruses and SV40 . The principal differences between MCV350 and MCV339 are a 191 - bp ( 1994 to 2184 nt ) deletion in the MCV339 T antigen gene and a 5 - bp ( 5216 to 5220 nt ) insertion in the MCV339 late promoter . Excluding these sites , only 41 ( 0 . 8 % ) nucleotides differ between MCV350 and 339 . Feng et al . Page 2 Science . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2009 September 10 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t To investigate the association between MCV infection and MCC , we compared tumors from 10 MCC patients to two tissue control groups . The first control group was composed of unselected tissues from various body sites ( including nine skin samples ) from 59 patients without MCC ( table S2 ) . These samples were taken consecutively on a single surgical day and tested for MCV positivity with two PCR primer sets in the T antigen locus ( LT1 and LT3 ) and one in the VP1 gene ( VP1 ) . These primers do not amplify cloned human BKV or JCV genomic DNA or SV40 genome from COS - 7 cells . A second control group composed of skin and skin tumor samples from 25 immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients without MCC were tested with LT1 and VP1 primers ( table S2 ) . Samples were randomized and tested in a blinded fashion . Southern blotting of PCR products was performed to increase sensitivity ( fig . S2 ) . Of the 10 MCC tumors from different patients , 8 ( 80 % ) were positive for MCV sequences by PCR ( Table 1 and table S1 ) . Seven tumors showed robust amplification , and one tumor was positive only after PCR - Southern hybridization . MCC348 ( metastasis from MCC347 ) and MCC338 ( infiltrating tumor from MCC339 ) were also positive . Two tumors , MCC343 and 346 , remained negative after testing with 13 PCR primer pairs spanning the MCV genome . None of the 59 control tissues , including nine skin samples , was positive by PCR alone , but five gastrointestinal tract tissues tested weakly positive after PCR - Southern hybridization ( 8 % , P < 0 . 0001 , table S2 ) . Viral T antigen sequences were recovered from three of these samples , confirming low copy number infection . Similarly , only 4 of 25 ( 16 % , P = 0 . 0007 , table S2 ) additional skin and non - MCC skin tumor samples from immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients tested positive for MCV sequences ( Table 2 and table S2 ) . To determine whether MCV DNA was integrated into the tumor genome , we examined MCC samples by direct Southern blotting without PCR amplification . When MCV DNA in MCC tumor is digested by single - cutter restriction endonucleases , such as EcoRI or BamHI , and probed with viral sequence , four possible patterns are predicted to occur : ( i ) if the viral DNA exists as freely replicating circular episomes , then a ∼ 5 . 4 kilobase ( kb ) band will be present ( integrated - concatenated virus will also generate a ∼ 5 . 4 kb band ) ; ( ii ) if MCV DNA integrates polyclonally , as might occur during secondary infection of the tumor if MCV is a passenger virus , then diffuse hybridization from different band sizes is expected ; ( iii ) if MCV DNA integrates at one or a few chromosomal sites , then the tumors will have identical or near - identical non - 5 . 4 - kb banding patterns ; or ( iv ) if MCV DNA integrates at different chromosomal sites before clonal expansion of the tumor cells , then distinct bands of different sizes will be present ( monoclonal viral integration ) . Eight of 11 MCC DNA samples ( including MCC348 metastasis from MCC347 ) digested with either BamHI or EcoRI showed robust MCV hybridization , and these corresponded to the same tumors positive by PCR analysis with multiple primers ( Fig . 3A and fig . S3 ) . Monoclonal viral integration ( pattern iv ) was evident with one or both enzymes in six tumors : MCC339 , 345 , 347 , 348 , 349 , and 352 ( solid arrowheads ) . EcoRI digestion of MCC339 , for example , produced two distinct 7 . 5 - and 12 . 2 - kb bands that would arise only if MCV is integrated at a single site in the majority of tumor cells . MCC344 and 350 bands have episomal or integrated - concatemeric bands ( open arrowhead , pattern i ) . MCC352 has a monoclonal integration pattern ( solid arrowheads , pattern iv ) on BamHI digestion as well as an intense 5 . 4 - kb band ( open arrowhead ) , consistent with an integrated concatemer . All three tumors negative by PCR with ethidium bromide staining ( MCC337 , 343 , and 346 ) were also negative by direct Southern blotting . The Southern blot banding patterns ( Fig . 3A ) were identical for MCC347 and its metastasis , MCC348 , in line with 3 ′ - RACE results ( Fig . 1B ) and confirming that MCC348 arose as a metastatic clone of MCC347 . Because the genomic integration site ( the PTPRG locus on chromosome 3p14 ) is mapped for these tumors , we performed Southern blotting with flanking Feng et al . Page 3 Science .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t human sequence probes to examine cellular monoclonal integration . NheI - SacI digestion of MCC347 and 348 is predicted to generate a 3 . 1 - kb fragment from the wild - type allele and a 3 . 9 - kb fragment from the allele containing the integrated MCV DNA . Hybridization with a flanking human PTPRG sequence probe revealed that the 3 . 9 - kb allele was present in MCC347 and 348 DNA but not in control tissue DNA ( Fig . 3B ) . As predicted , the same fragment hybridized to a MCV T antigen sequence probe , consistent with both cellular and viral monoclonality in this tumor . These results provide evidence that MCV infection and genome integration occurred in this tumor before clonal expansion of tumor cells . MCV in MCC may have some parallels to high - risk human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , which causes cervical cancer mainly after viral episome disruption and integration into the cervical epithelial cell genome ( 16 ) . If MCV plays a causal role in tumorigenesis , it could conceivably do so by several mechanisms , including T antigen expression , insertional mutagenesis , or both . Our DTS results show tumor expression of MCV T antigen , which has conserved DnaJ ( 4 ) , pocket protein - binding LXCXE ( 17 ) , and pp2A - binding ( 18 , 19 ) domains previously shown to play roles in polyomavirus - induced cell transformation . Mutational disruption of the PTPRG gene , which is suspected to be a tumor suppressor ( 20 ) , could also play a role in MCC , although our Southern blot data suggest that MCV integration occurs at various genomic sites in different MCC tumors . Our study validates the utility of DTS for the discovery of cryptic human viruses , but it has also revealed some limitations of the approach . Of the four tumors we sampled , only one ( MCC347 ) was infected at high copy number . MCV transcripts in this tumor were present at 10 transcripts per million or about 5 transcripts per tumor cell . In future searches for other directly transforming tumor viruses ( 21 ) , DTS should be used on multiple highly uniform samples sequenced to a depth of 200 , 000 transcripts or greater . Because DTS is quantitative , it is less likely to be useful in its current form for discovery of low - abundance viruses in autoimmune disorders or other chronic infectious diseases . Discovery of MCV by DTS nonetheless shows that DTS and related approaches ( 22 ) are promising methods to identify previously unknown human tumor viruses .
