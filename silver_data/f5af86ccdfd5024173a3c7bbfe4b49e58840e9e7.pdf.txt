A series of physio - logical and pathological conditions favour the accumulation of misfolded proteins at the ER lumen , resulting in a cellular state known as ER stress 1 . To cope with misfolded proteins , cells engage a dynamic signalling pathway known as the UPR 2 . In vertebrates , the UPR has evolved towards the establishment of a network of inter - connected signalling cascades initiated by three types of transduc - ers known as inositol - requiring enzyme 1 ( IRE1 ) alpha and beta , activating transcription factor - 6 ( ATF6 ) alpha and beta , and pro - tein kinase RNA ( PKR ) - like ER kinase ( PERK ) . The UPR controls specific transcription factors that feedback to restore proteostasis 1 or activate apoptotic programmes 3 . ER stress is also emerging as a relevant factor driving diverse pathological conditions , including cancer , diabetes , inflammatory diseases and neurodegeneration 4 , 5 . IRE1 α is a serine / threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease that catalyses the unconventional processing of the messenger RNA encoding X - box binding protein 1 ( XBP1 ) , resulting in the expres - sion of an active transcription factor ( XBP1s ) that enforces adap - tation programmes 6 , 7 . In addition to the classical role of IRE1 α as an ER stress mediator , a series of novel physiological outputs of the pathway have been reported that are dependent on XBP1s and affect cell differentiation , angiogenesis and energy metabolism 2 . IRE1 α signalling is tightly regulated by the assembly of protein complexes that fine - tune its activity , a platform referred to as the UPRosome 8 . Thus , defining the IRE1 α interactome may reveal unexpected func - tions to delineate the significance of the UPR in cell physiology . Here , we performed a protein – protein interaction screen and identified filamin A as a major IRE1 α binding partner . Filamin A is involved in crosslinking polymerized actin and has a crucial role in adhesion , cell morphology and migration 9 . We demonstrate that the IRE1 α – filamin A axis regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell movement . Unexpectedly , this function of IRE1 α is con - trolled by its dimerization , independent of its canonical signalling as a UPR mediator . We also provide evidence indicating that the regulation of cell migration by IRE1 α is disease relevant and evolu - tionarily conserved . Overall , our results reveal an unanticipated site of control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics from the ER , where IRE1 α serves as a scaffold to engage filamin A signalling and modulate cell movement . IRE1 α governs cytoskeleton remodelling and cell migration through a direct interaction with filamin A Hery Urra 1 , 2 , 3 , Daniel R .

Here , we identified filamin A as a major binding partner of the ER stress transducer IRE1 α . Filamin A is an actin crosslinking factor involved in cytoskeleton remodelling . We show that IRE1 α controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics and affects cell migration upstream of filamin A . The regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics by IRE1 α is independent of its canonical role as a UPR mediator , serving instead as a scaffold that recruits and regulates filamin A . Targeting IRE1 α expression in mice affected normal brain development , generating a phenotype resembling periventricular heterotopia , a disease linked to the loss of function of filamin A . IRE1 α also modulated cell movement and cytoskeleton dynamics in fly and zebrafish models . This study unveils an unanticipated biological function of IRE1 α in cell migration , whereby filamin A operates as an interphase between the UPR and the actin cytoskeleton .

To identify new IRE1 α - interacting proteins we performed a yeast two - hybrid screen using the Matchmaker pretransformed complementary DNA library together with the cytosolic domain of IRE1 α ( IRE1 α - Δ N ) as bait . Multiple candidates were found ( Supplementary Table 1 ) to be involved in different biological processes ( Supplementary Fig . 1A , B ) , including COPS5 , a known IRE1 α binding partner 10 . Among the top ten candidates selected on the basis of the growth index , filamin A presented the strongest interaction ( Fig . 1a ) . Filamin A is an actin - binding protein involved in the orthogonal crosslinking of polymerized actin 9 . It is composed of 24 IgG - like repeats , containing several domains including the CH2 domain , Rod1 and Rod2 , and an IgG - like 24 repeat involved in filamin A dimerization 11 . All clones selected corresponded to the carboxy - terminal portion of filamin A ( Fig . 1b , c ) . To validate our findings , we transfected HEK293T cells with expression vectors for full - length HA ( human influenza hemagglutinin ) - tagged IRE1 α ( IRE1 α - HA ) and a filamin A con - struct fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) at the C - terminal region ( filamin A - GFP ) . Immunoprecipitation of IRE1 α - HA revealed a clear association of filamin A with the cytosolic domain of IRE1 α ( Fig . 1d ) . Additionally , we detected an association between IRE1 α - HA and endogenous filamin A in IRE1 α knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) reconstituted with physiological levels of IRE1 α 12 ( Fig . 1e ; see controls in Supplementary Fig . 1C ) . Interestingly , this interaction was enhanced under ER stress induced by tunicamycin , a pharmacological inhibitor of N - linked glycosyl - ation ( Fig . 1e ) , or with fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , a pro - migratory stimulus ( Fig . 1f ) . We also corroborated the existence of an endog - enous protein complex in Huh7 cells ( Fig . 1g ) . Using individual IgG - like repeats of filamin A , we demonstrated that domains 22 – 23 e f g j h FLNA IRE1 α IgG FLNA IRE1 α I npu t I P : I R E 1 α Huh7 170 130 55 170130 i FLNA - GFP IRE1 α - HA ER ER C o l o c a li z a t i on F L N A / I R E 1 α 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 Total * * * * FLNA CH2 Rod1 Rod224 Clone 1 Clone 2 Clone 3 Gene name Growthindex No . clones Flna 12 3 Adnp 12 1 Bpgm 11 2 Negr1 10 2 Arcn1 10 1 Msl2 9 1 Cops5 9 1 Zmym2 - 5 9 3 Cnrip1 7 1 Eef1a1 6 6 a b d c Dilution : ( + ) IRE1 α∆ N IRE1 αΔ N / FLNA - Leu / - Trp - Ade / - His / - Leu / - Trp / x - α - Gal IP : HA WB : GFP IP : HA WB : HA WB : GFP Total extract – – – + – IRE1 αΔ N - HA : IRE1 α - HA : FLNA - GFP : + – + – – – + + + – Δ N FL 170 130 70 130 100 kDa HEK293T k C o l o c a li z a t i on F L N A / E R 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 * FLNA HA FLNA Total extract I P : H A + – + Tm : 170 130 170 + + IRE1 α - HA : – kDa MEFs IRE1 α KO 1 . 0 Fold : 5 . 2 – FLNA Total extract FLNA HA I P : H A + – + FBS : 170 130 170 + + IRE1 α - HA : – kDa MEFs IRE1 α KO 1 . 0 Fold : 2 . 7 – IRE1 α GST GST 100 10070 35 55 * IP : HA WB : GFP IP : HA WB : HA WB : GFP Total extract IRE1 α - HA : FLNA - GFP : + + + – – 19 20 – HEK293T + + + + 21 22 23 24 130 40 40 55 20 μ m I R E 1 α K O + I R E 1 α - H A I R E 1 α K O + M o ck FLNAER 20 μ m 1 10 – 1 10 – 2 10 – 3 1 10 – 1 10 – 2 10 – 3 N I S I R E 1 α kDa kDa – 19 – 2120 – 24 kDa 10 μ m FBS : – – + + 10 μ m Zoom + FBS FBS : IRE1 α - HA : – – – – + + + + Fig . 1 | IRE1 α physically interacts with filamin A . a , Results of the yeast two - hybrid screen of the cytosolic domain of IRE1 α and the Matchmaker pretransformed cDNA library from adult mouse brain .

NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | VOL 20 | AUGUST 2018 | 942 – 953 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 943 Articles NATURE CEll BIology account for the interaction with IRE1 α ( Fig . 1h ) . These domains are central to the interaction with several signalling proteins , but they are unrelated to its ability to associate with polymerized actin 9 . Finally , using recombinant proteins , we replicated the direct bind - ing of IRE1 α to a fragment of filamin A spanning the 20 – 24 IgG - like repeat region , but not to the adjacent domain ( Fig . 1i ) . Quantification of colocalization using the Manders coefficient between IRE1 α - HA and filamin A - GFP showed an enhanced asso - ciation after stimulation of cells with FBS . Similar results were obtained when the analysis was confined to the ER ( KDEL - RFP sig - nal ) ( Fig . 1j ) , suggesting that filamin A relocates to the ER in close proximity to IRE1 α . Importantly , the redistribution of filamin A to the ER was dependent on the expression of IRE1 α ( Fig . 1k ) . Taken together , these results indicate that filamin A interacts directly with IRE1 α at the ER in multiple cellular systems . IRE1 α controls the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton . Since filamin A has an active role in modulating morphological changes through local actin cytoskeleton remodelling 13 , we tested the con - tribution of IRE1 α to this process . We monitored actin cytoskel - eton dynamics using LifeAct 14 . Time - lapse confocal microscopy of IRE1 α - deficient cells revealed a reduced number of filopodia and lamellipodial protrusions ( lamellipodia index ) per cell ( Fig . 2a , b ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) .

NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | VOL 20 | AUGUST 2018 | 942 – 953 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 944 Articles NATURE CEll BIology of cortical filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , measured by the total area showing protrusions and retractions over time , presented a marked decrease in IRE1 α - deficient cells ( Fig . 2a - c ; Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . This observation correlated with an altered distribution of polymer - ized actin across the cell upon targeting IRE1 α expression ( Fig . 2d ; Supplementary Fig . 2B ) . Furthermore , the velocity of protru - sions and retractions was dramatically reduced in IRE1 α - null cells ( Fig . 2e ) . For comparison , we also analysed filamin A - deficient cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2C ) . Similar results were obtained when the lamellipodia index was evaluated in fixed cells ( Fig . 2f ) . In addi - tion , electron microscopy analysis of the distribution of cortical actin bundles , a structure highly concentrated in crosslinked actin 13 , indicated a narrower area of actin bundles in IRE1 α - deficient cells ( Fig . 2g ) . Actin cytoskeleton dynamics is dependent on the activity of small GTPases from the RhoA family 15 . Therefore , we evaluated the activity of Rac1 , a RhoA GTPase that mediates the formation of actin protrusions in different cells types 15 and is regulated by fila - min A 16 . The amount of active Rac1 coupled to GTP was decreased in IRE1 α - null cells as determined using pull - down assays with the recombinant CRIB1 domain ( amino acids 67 – 150 ) of p21 - activated kinase ( PAK1 ) as bait ( Fig . 2h ) . Remarkably , stimulation with FBS or ER stress enhanced the activation of Rac1 in an IRE1 α - depen - dent manner ( Fig . 2i ) . These results indicate that IRE1 α expression modulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics and Rac1 activation . IRE1 α deficiency impairs cell migration . We then determined whether IRE1 α regulates cell movement as a readout of cytoskeleton alterations . Stimulation of IRE1 α knockout cells with FBS revealed a significant decrease in cell migration in wound - healing assays com - pared to control cells ( Fig . 3a ) . Similar results were obtained when transmigration was evaluated using the Boyden chamber assay ( Fig . 3b ) . As a control , we measured cell proliferation , a parameter that was not modified in IRE1 α - null cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3A ) . Importantly , filamin A ( Flna ) knockout MEFs presented a similar extent of cell movement impairment as IRE1 α - deficient cells ( Fig . 3b ; Supplementary Fig . 3B ) . Targeting IRE1 α expression using short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) or via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) – Cas9 also led to a significant attenuation of cell migration in MEFs ( Fig . 3c , d ) . Notably , target - ing IRE1 α expression affected cell movement in different cell lines ( Fig . 3e ; Supplementary Figs . 3C , and 8A ) . Finally , transient overex - pression of IRE1 α - HA in wild - type MEFs also enhanced cell migra - tion ( Supplementary Fig . 3D ) . We next investigated whether filamin A is involved in the regu - lation of cell movement by IRE1 α . Remarkably , the impairment of cell movement generated by knocking down IRE1 α was reversed by the overexpression of filamin A ( Fig . 3f ; Supplementary Fig . 3E ) . In sharp contrast , overexpression of IRE1 α failed to enhance cell migration in filamin A - null cells ( Fig . 3g ; Supplementary Fig . 3F ) . Thus , IRE1 α requires filamin A to regulate cell migration . In addi - tion , as reported in filamin A - null cells 17 , 18 , IRE1 α deficiency led to decreased ER and cell spreading upon attachment ( Fig . 3h ) and reduced cell adhesion ( Fig . 3i ) . Recently , it was described that PERK interacts with filamin A , affecting actin localization and the formation of ER – plasma mem - brane contact sites 19 . Thus , we determined the contribution of other UPR signalling branches to cell movement . Knocking down PERK or inhibiting it with GSK2606414 reduced cell migration with a similar ratio in both IRE1 α - null and control cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3G , H ) . This result suggests that the effects of IRE1 α in cell migration are independent of PERK signalling . In contrast , knocking down ATF6 did not affect cell migration in MEFs ( Supplementary Fig . 3I ) . IRE1 α regulates cell migration by interacting with filamin A . An analysis of the primary sequence of IRE1 α indicated the presence of a proline - rich domain at the distal C - terminal region that is similar to a SH3 - binding domain ( XXPXXP or PXXPX ) but of unknown function and structure 20 ( Fig . 4a ) . Although filamin A does not con - tain an SH3 domain , it associates with several proteins containing proline - rich sequences 11 . We performed a pull - down assay using a region containing the proline - rich portion of IRE1 α ( previously named F11 21 ) and observed a positive interaction with endogenous filamin A ( Fig . 4b ) but not with a different IRE1 α region ( F6 pep - tide ; Fig . 4c ) . We repeated the pull - down assay and then performed Coomassie Blue staining and a mass spectrometry analysis to iden - tify the most abundant proteins . Remarkably , filamin A was one of the major F11 - binding partners found in this screen ( Fig . 4d ) . We then tested the contribution of the proline - rich domain of IRE1 α to cell movement . Deletion of the complete F11 sequence abrogated the ability of IRE1 α to enhance cell migration ( Fig . 4e ) . Mutagenesis of the proline - rich domain by deleting the fragment spanning amino acids 965 – 977 of IRE1 α ( IRE1 α Δ 965 ) or by replac - ing all three proline residues to alanine ( IRE1 α AAAA ) ( Fig . 4a ) did not affect the RNase activity of IRE1 α ( Fig . 4f , bottom panel ) , but fully blocked the ability of IRE1 α to regulate cell migration ( Fig . 4g ) and actin cytoskeleton remodelling ( Fig . 4h ; Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . These experiments fully dissected the activity of IRE1 α on UPR and cell migration . In agreement with these findings , a reduction in the binding between IRE1 α and filamin A was observed when IRE1 α Δ 965 and IRE1 α AAAA mutants were tested ( Fig . 4i ) . We also performed competition experiments using different F11 peptide mutants . The expression of the F11 peptide disrupted the interaction between the filamin A - 22 domain and IRE1 α - HA in co - immunoprecipitation experiments , whereas this effect was attenuated by mutations in the proline - rich region ( Fig . 4j , k ) . Overall , our results suggest that the physical interaction between filamin A and IRE1 α is required to enhance cell migration . IRE1 α is an upstream regulator of filamin A phosphorylation . The activity of filamin A in cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migra - tion depends on the phosphorylation of serine 2 , 152 ( S2152 ) 11 , 22 . A robust enhancement of filamin A phosphorylation was detected in cells stimulated with serum in IRE1 α - expressing MEFs compared with knockout cells ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Similarly , stimulation of cells with tunicamycin showed significantly higher filamin A phosphory - lation in IRE1 α - expressing cells ( Fig . 5a , c ) . The remaining phos - phorylation observed in IRE1 α - deficient cells was independent of PERK , as demonstrated by transfecting cells with small interfering ( siRNAs ) or by treating cells with GSK2606414 ( Supplementary Fig . 5A ) . We also determined that the fraction of filamin A bound to IRE1 α is phosphorylated in cells stimulated with FBS ( Fig . 5d ) or tunicamycin ( Fig . 5e ) . We then determined whether filamin A phosphorylation is required for the modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics down - stream of IRE1 α . Transient transfection of wild - type filamin A , and not a S2152A mutant , restored the normal levels of actin cytoskele - ton dynamics and cell migration observed when IRE1 α was targeted ( Fig . 5f , g ; Supplementary Fig . 5B – E ) . In addition , simple overexpres - sion of filamin A resulted in its phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . 5F ) , which may explain the ability of this strategy to bypass IRE1 α deficiency . Importantly , deletion of the filamin A - binding domain in IRE1 α led to in reduced filamin A phosphorylation ( Fig . 5h ) . Based on our results , we hypothesized that IRE1 α serves as a scaffold to recruit the kinases involved in filamin A phosphory - lation . The most relevant regulators of filamin A are PAK1 16 , CDK4 23 , PKC α 24 and MEKK4 22 , 25 . A pharmacological screen indi - cated that PAK1 and PKC α mediated filamin A phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . 5G ) . These results were then validated using siRNAs . Knocking down PKC α reduced filamin A phosphoryla - tion under ER stress ( Fig . 5i ; Supplementary Fig . 5H ) and FBS stimulation ( Supplementary Fig . 5I ) . In addition , IRE1 α deficiency NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | VOL 20 | AUGUST 2018 | 942 – 953 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 945 Articles NATURE CEll BIology rendered cells less sensitive to the inhibition of migration by the PKC α inhibitor Gö6976 ( Fig . 5j ) . In agreement with this result , PKC α activation was decreased in IRE1 α - deficient cells upon FBS stimulation ( Supplementary Fig . 5J , K ) . We also detected an interaction between IRE1 α , filamin A and PKC α in immunopre - cipitation experiments ( Fig . 5k ) . Using cellular fractionation and colocalization experiments , we observed a relocalization of PKC α to the ER in an IRE1 α - dependent manner ( Fig . 5l , m ; see controls in Supplementary Fig . 5L ) . Taken together , these data indicate that IRE1 α facilitates filamin A phosphorylation , which is mediated by PKC α , to induce actin cytoskeleton remodelling and cell migration . IRE1 α acts as a scaffold to regulate cell migration and filamin A phosphorylation . Since IRE1 α is required for cell migration , we explored the contribution of XBP1 to this biological function . Remarkably , XBP1 deficiency or inhibition of the RNase activity of IRE1 α had no impact on cell migration ( Fig . 6a ; Supplementary Fig . 6A ) . We also expressed IRE1 α carrying different mutations that impair its kinase activity ( K599A ) , kinase and endoribonucle - ase activity ( P830L ) or its ability to dimerize ( D123P ) 26 . Although all three IRE1 α mutants lost their ability to catalyse Xbp1 mRNA splicing under ER stress ( Fig . 6b ; Supplementary Fig . 6B ) , only the D123P variant impaired the pro - migratory activity of IRE1 α ( Fig . 6c ; Supplementary Fig . 6C ) . Consistent with these results , the expression of the D123P mutant did not restore actin dynamics in IRE1 α - null cells ( Fig . 6d ; Supplementary Fig . 6D ) . These findings indicate that IRE1 α facilitates cell migration independent of its canonical signalling but requires its dimerization . We studied IRE1 α oligomerization using an IRE1 α - GFP construct ( IRE1 - 3F6H - GFP ) to visualize IRE1 α clustering 27 .

NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | VOL 20 | AUGUST 2018 | 942 – 953 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 947 Articles NATURE CEll BIology associations with filamin A compared with wild - type IRE1 α ( Fig . 6f ) . However , interaction studies using the D123P mutant with the filamin A - 22 domain alone indicated reduced binding under resting and ER stress conditions ( Fig . 6g , h ) . Similar results were observed when IRE1 α Δ 965 and IRE1 α AAAA mutants were tested ( Fig . 6g ) . In addition , IRE1 α expression favours the forma - tion of dimers and larger order oligomers of filamin A ( Fig . 6i ) . Remarkably , filamin A phosphorylation was abolished in IRE1 α knockout cells expressing the D123P dimerization mutant ( Fig . 6j ) . Taken together , these results suggest that IRE1 α acts as a scaffold to recruit filamin A at resting conditions , inducing its phosphoryla - tion upon IRE1 α dimerization . IRE1 α regulates actin dynamics and cell migration in multi - ple model systems . To explore the physiological relevance of our findings , we used two in vivo models of cell migration coupled with genetic manipulation . We studied Drosophila melanogaster plasmatocytes ( haemocytes ) , which are motile cells with functions and features similar to that of vertebrate macrophages 28 . Knocking down fly IRE1 α ( Ire1 ) by RNA interference resulted in reduced dis - tance and velocity of movement ( Fig . 7a ; Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Under these conditions , haemocytes exhibited an elongated mor - phology with reduced lamellipodia ( Fig . 7b ) . Remarkably , overex - pression of Cheerio ( the filamin A form in D . melanogaster ) fully rescued the migratory impairment triggered by knocking down fly IRE1 α ( Fig . 7a ) . To further examine the role of IRE1 α in cell migra - tion , we used an insertional Ire1 mutant coupled with a mosaic analysis , whereby only IRE1 α - deficient cells are labelled with GFP 29 ( scheme shown in Supplementary Fig . 7A ) . Primary cultures from Ire1 α mutant cells were smaller in size area and showed reduced number of lamellar extensions ( Fig . 7c ) . Remarkably , knocking down IRE1 α led to a reduction of the retrograde flow of actin , reflected in a lower frequency in the velocity maps using the LifeAct reporter ( Fig . 7d ; Supplementary Movie 3 ) .

Remarkably , the vegetal progression of epiboly was delayed in IRE1 α - DN embryos compared with control animals ( Fig . 7f ) . Furthermore , this phenotype was associated with an increased head - to - tail angular separation ( Fig . 7g ) that is indica - tive of reduced anterior – posterior axial movements 33 . Finally , the width of the first somites at 12 h post fertilization was increased by ∼ 40 % in IRE1 α - DN embryos compared with controls ( Fig . 7h ) , suggesting that the paraxial mesoderm suffered defective con - vergence . These alterations resulted in embryos with a shortened anterior – posterior axis at 24 h post fertilization ( Fig . 7i ) , a pheno - type that is suggestive of defective early gastrulation movements 34 . Importantly , none of these phenotypes were observed in embryos overexpressing wild - type IRE1 α ( Supplementary Fig . 7D ) . We also observed reduced cell movement with single - cell track - ing during the epiboly process ( Fig . 7j ; Supplementary Movie 4 ) . In addition , using an actin reporter 35 , we observed that epiblast cells of embryos injected with IRE1 α - DN became rounded and less cohesive during gastrulation , showing reduced filopodial - like activity and increased formation of blebs compared with controls ( Fig . 7k ; Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Moreover , the cortical distribu - tion of F - actin appeared more homogeneous and less dynamic in IRE1 α - DN embryos compared with controls ( Fig . 7k ; Supplementary Fig . 7E ) . Together , these experiments indicate that IRE1 α expres - sion has a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved activity in controlling actin cytoskeleton function and cell movement in vivo . IRE1 α deficiency alters radial migration of cortical neurons mimicking periventricular nodular heterotopia . Filamin A expression is essential for neuronal migration during brain cortex development , and mutations in the FLNA gene are the main cause of periventricular nodular heterotopia , a syndrome characterized by the abnormal localization of neurons along the walls of the lat - eral ventricle 36 , 37 .

The UPR transducer IRE1 α signals through an unconventional mechanism that is independent of its enzymatic activities to control actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Monomeric IRE1 α physically interacts with filamin A through a novel domain located at the distal C - terminal region . A pro - migratory stimulus triggers IRE1 α dimerization , increasing the binding of filamin A and the recruitment of PKC α . Phosphorylation of filamin A at S2152 by PKC α increases actin cytoskeleton remodelling and cell migration in various animal species .

Therefore , we generated IRE1 α ( Ern1 ) - null animals and examined brain tissue at embryonic day 14 . 5 ( E14 . 5 ) . An analysis of post - mitotic cells of layer VI of the brain cortex after Tbr1 stain - ing revealed a delay in the formation of this layer in IRE1 α knock - out animals compared with heterozygous mice ( Fig . 8a ) . Similar observations were obtained when the width of the cortex was quantified ( Fig . 8a ) . We defined whether the morphological alterations observed during brain development in IRE1 α - deficient animals were due to altered radial cell migration in vivo . We studied animals at E14 . 5 because high levels of filamin A and IRE1 α were detected at that developmental stage ( E12 . 5 – 14 . 5 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 8C , D ) . We then performed in utero brain electroporation to knock down IRE1 α in the developing cortex together with GFP at E14 . 5 to tar - get cortical neural progenitors ( strategy in Supplementary Fig . 8B ) . Normal development of neurons in layers II / III at birth was observed in control brains electroporated with a construct expressing a shRNA against luciferase mRNA ( control ) . In contrast , brains elec - troporated with a shRNA to target IRE1 α showed delayed migration ( Fig . 8b ) . Quantification of neuronal distribution in cortical layers demonstrated that knocking down IRE1 α resulted in a significant delay of neuronal migration , with cells accumulating at inferior cor - tical layers ( Fig . 8c , d ; Supplementary Fig . 8E ) . For comparison , we also knocked down filamin A , which also resulted in altered neuro - nal migration ( Fig . 8b – d ) . Remarkably , electroporation of wild - type filamin A together with the shRNA targeting IRE1 α , but not the filamin A S2152 mutant , rescued the detrimental effects of IRE1 α deficiency in cortical neuronal migration , leading to a recovery in the percentage of cells reaching layer II / III and IV / V ( Fig . 8e , f ; Supplementary Fig . 8F , G ) . Overall , these results demonstrate that the regulation of filamin A by IRE1 α plays an essential role in neu - ronal migration during brain cortex development . Discussion Although IRE1 α represents the most conserved UPR signal trans - ducer , its physiological function is still poorly understood . Most studies addressing the biological relevance of IRE1 α in tissue homeostasis have been developed in artificial models of ER stress , and only a few reports support the existence of alternative activities of the pathway beyond protein - folding stress . Here , we identified filamin A as a major IRE1 α interactor and uncovered a previously unanticipated function of this protein in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics , with a significant impact on cell migration in various model systems . Remarkably , although many interac - tome studies have been performed to identify novel IRE1 α binding partners 2 , no direct connections between IRE1 α and cytoskeleton dynamics have been reported . We characterized an unconventional signalling mechanism underlying IRE1 α function , whereby it serves as a scaffold to recruit filamin A and potentiate the migratory capacity of the cell . We fully dissected the impact of IRE1 α in cell migration , which is distinct from its classical role in the UPR and mediated by a previously uncharacterized proline - rich domain . We propose a two - step model whereby filamin A is associated to the ER through direct binding to IRE1 α . Then , after stimulation with a pro - migratory stimulus , IRE1 α dimerization and oligomerization induces a further recruit - ment of filamin A , scaffolding to PKC α , to increase filamin A dimer - ization and phosphorylation . This mechanism results in increased cytoskeleton dynamics ( Fig . 8g ) . At the molecular level , we provide evidence to indicate that IRE1 α increases filamin A phosphoryla - tion at S2152 , a specific regulatory event controlling cytoskeleton dynamics . One main question that remains to be addressed is the nature of the signals promoting IRE1 α oligomerization during cell migration . Alterations of filamin A are the underlying cause of periven - tricular nodular heterotopia , a human condition affecting brain development and is associated with mental retardation and cogni - tive impairment 36 , 37 . Our study demonstrates that targeting IRE1 α phenocopies the consequences of filamin A deficiency in the devel - oping brain . At least ten different regulators of filamin A are able to modulate neuronal migration 39 , suggesting that a tight regula - tory network that fine - tunes filamin A function is fundamental for brain development . Fingerprints of UPR activation were reported during the brain development in mouse , Caenorhabditis elegans and D . melanogaster models ( reviewed previously 40 ) . Interestingly , PERK expression also affects brain development at the level of neurogenesis and the generation of intermediate progenitors and projection neurons of the brain cortex 41 . Moreover , the alternative activity of IRE1 α described here may be relevant in the context of other diseases . FiIamin A has been proposed to contribute to the metastatic potential of cancer 42 . Thus , the IRE1 α – filamin A axis may also enhance the occurrence of metastasis , an activity that may be insensitive to chemotherapy based on IRE1 α RNase inhibitors . Overall , our study demonstrates a conserved function of IRE1 α in actin cytoskeleton dynamics that is independent of its well - known role as an ER stress transducer , acting as a scaffold that recruits and potentiates filamin A function . Our findings illuminate how fun - damental processes surveilling ER homeostasis are interconnected with the global machinery controlling cell movement .

Tunicamycin was purchased from Calbiochem EMB Bioscience . Cell culture media , fetal calf serum and antibiotics were obtained from Life Technologies . Fluorescent probes and secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescent markers were purchased from Molecular Probes , Invitrogen . All other reagents used were from Sigma or of the highest grade available . Cell culture and DNA constructs . All MEFs and HEK cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 5 % FBS , non - essential amino acids and grown at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . IRE1 α - deficient cells were produced as previously described 6 . Briefly , retroviral plasmids were transfected using Effectene ( Qiagen ) into HEK293GPG cells in order to prepare IRE1 α - HA expressing retroviruses were generated , as previously described 43 , in the pMSCV - Hygro vector , whereby the IRE1 α contains two tandem HA sequences at the C - terminal domain and a precision enzyme site before the HA tag . pRK5 - F6 or F11 plasmids were generated as previously described 21 . Constructs of pEGFP expressing filamin A were generated as previously described 18 . Wild - type filamin A or S2152A mutants in pcDNA3 . 1 plasmids were a gift from J . Blenis ( Addgene plasmid # 8982 and # 8983 ) ( Weill Cornell Medicine , New York , NY ) . Wild - type filamin A or S2152A mutants in pcDNA3 . 1 plasmids were subcloned into the pCAGIG vector for in utero electroporation experiments 44 . Yeast - two hybrid assays . The interaction between the IRE1 α Δ N protein and a library of adult mouse cDNA was performed using a Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two - Hybrid System ( Clontech ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Briefly , AH109 yeast cells were transformed with plasmid pGADT7 ( bait ) encoding the cytoplasmic domain of IRE1 α ( IRE1 α Δ N ) . The Y187 yeast strain contains the plasmid pGBKT7 ( prey ) encoding for a Normalized Yeast Two - Hybrid cDNA Library derived from adult mouse brain . Both plasmids encode for four different reporters : HIS3 , ADE2 , MEL1 and LacZ . AH109 and Y187 were mated for 24 h at 30 °C in YPDA media ( common media containing yeast extract , peptone , dextrose and adenine ) . Mated yeasts were plated in synthetic defined medium SD - Leu / - Trp ( DDO ) , SD - Leu / - Trp / - His ( TDO ) or SD - Leu / - Trp / - His / - Ade ( QDO ) for 3 – 7 days at 30 °C . The positive interactions were re - tested by re - streaking on TDO and QDO media after 3 – 7 days at 30 °C . Media lacking amino acids were also supplemented with X - α - galactoside ( 40 μ g ml – 1 ) , which changes the colonies that exhibit a positive interaction blue in colour . A growth index was calculated by visual observation ( 0 to 3 score ) of the size and blue colouration of the selected colonies in TDO and QDO media . We used the interaction between pGBKT7 - p53 and pGADT7 - T as a positive control ( Clontech ) . Plasmids of yeast colonies that showed positive interactions were rescued and transformed into Escherichia coli and then purified . Purified clones were then sequenced , and bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify target sequences . To validate the interaction between IRE1 α and filamin A , AH109 yeast cells were co - transformed with plasmid pGADT7 - IRE1 α Δ N and pGBKT7 - filamin A . Eight microlitres of each suspension and three subsequent tenfold serial dilutions were individually spotted onto a medium SD - Leu / - Trp , SD - Leu / - Trp / - His and SD ( - Leu / - Trp / - His / X - α - Gal ) plates for selection . Cells were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days . RNA isolation , RT - PCR and real - time PCR . PCR primers and methods for the Xbp1 mRNA splicing assay have been previously described 45 .

Expression and purification of the CRIB domain of PAK1 or the FLNA - 19 – 21 and FLNA - 21 – 24 IgG repeats were performed as described previously 47 . BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli strains carrying pGEX - glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - CRIB were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria broth media containing ampicillin . Cultures were diluted 1 : 100 and grown in fresh medium at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0 . 7 . Next , IPTG ( isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM . The cultures were grown for an additional 2 h and then samples were collected and sonicated in lysis buffer A ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 25 mM NaF , 0 . 5 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor complex ( Roche ) ) .

GST fusion protein was quantified and visualized in SDS – polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue . Pull - down assays . FLNA - 19 – 21 and FLNA - 21 – 24 GST filamin domains bound to Sepharose - glutathione resin were incubated with 4 µ g of the cytoplasmic domain of GST - tagged IRE1 α for 6 h at 4 °C on an end - to - end rotor . After incubation , the mixture was centrifuged at 2 , 000 r . p . m . for 4 min and the supernatant was discarded . The resin was washed with 400 µ l of lysis buffer at 4 °C for 10 min and subsequently centrifuged . This process was repeated five times . The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min and analysed by western blotting . Western blot analysis . Cells were collected and homogenized in RIPA buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) in presence of 50 mM NaF and 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 . Protein concentrations were determined in all experiments by micro - BCA assay ( Pierce ) , and 20 - 40 µ g of total protein was loaded onto 8 – 12 % SDS – PAGE minigels ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) before transfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes . Membranes were blocked using PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween20 ( PBST ) containing 5 % milk for 60 min at room temperature then probed overnight with primary antibodies . The following antibodies diluted in blocking solution were used : anti - HSP90 ( 1 : 5000 ) ; anti - HA ( 1 : 1000 ; Roche ) ; anti - GFP ( 1 : 3000 ; Sigma ) ; anti - filamin A ( 1 : 1000 ) ; anti - phospho S2152 filamin A ( 1 : 1000 ) ; and anti - IRE1 α ( 1 : 1000 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) .

Subcellular fractionation was performed following a previously described protocol 48 . In brief , cells were washed and ground in a stainless - steel dounce dura - grind tissue grinder ( Wheaton ) . Cellular integrity was evaluated every five strokes with trypan blue staining . Homogenate was centrifuged 2 times at 640 × g to remove unbroken cells and nuclei . Supernatant was centrifuged twice at 9 , 000 × g to pellet crude mitochondria . The supernatant was further spun at 20 , 000 × g for 30 min to obtain a pellet of lysosomes and plasma membrane and a supernatant that , upon further 100 , 000 × g centrifugation , gave a supernatant ( cytosol ) and a pellet ( ER ) . Western blot analyses were used to validate each fraction with different antibodies . Indirect immunofluorescence analysis . IRE1 α - HA , PKC α - Flag and KDEL proteins were visualized by immunofluorescence . Cells were fixed for 30 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % NP - 40 in PBS containing 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 10 min . After blocking for 1 h with 10 % FBS in PBS containing 0 . 5 % BSA , cells were incubated with anti - HA , anti - Flag or anti - KDEL antibodies overnight at 4 °C . Cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0 . 5 % BSA , and incubated with Alexa - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) for 1 h at 37 °C . Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye . Coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount G onto slides and visualized by confocal microscopy ( Fluoview FV1000 ) . We used a sensitive method based on a confined displacement analysis algorithm to calculate colocalization coefficients between IRE1 α - HA and filamin A - GFP 49 . NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATURE CEll BIology The colocalization of images was performed as previously described 49 . Briefly , images obtained by confocal microscopy using a × 60 oil objective lens ( NA : 1 . 35 ) were subjected to Huygens deconvolution software . Each channel used for filamin A - GFP , IRE1 α - HA and KDEL RFP ( or Flag ) was then segmented using a series of filters using IDL software to obtain masked images of each channel . These masked images were used to determine Manders colocalization coefficients and to quantify true and random colocalization between channels . In addition , a specific mask was applied to evaluate colocalization in the ER region ( KDEL - RFP ) or total cellular area ( filamin A - GFP ) . Targeting IRE1 α in MEFs . We generated stable MEFs with reduced levels of IRE1 α using previously described methods 50 by targeting IRE1 α mRNA with two different shRNAs using the lentiviral expression vector pLKO . 1 and puromycin selection . As a control , a shRNA against the luciferase gene was used . Constructs were obtained from The Broad Institute . Targeting sequences used for mouse IRE1 α were as follows : GGAATCCTCTACATGGGTAAA and GCTGAACTACTTGAGGAATTA . To generate lentiviruses , HEK cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate protocol with 1 µ g of VSV - G vector , 1 µ g of Δ 8 . 9 vector and 1 µ g of shRNA vector . After 48 h of transfection , the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0 . 45 µ m filter .

This statement should provide the following information , where applicable : - Accession codes , unique identifiers , or web links for publicly available datasets - A list of figures that have associated raw data - A description of any restrictions on data availability All data and materials along with detailed instructions on their use are available from the authors upon request . No raw data have been linked in the manuscript . Field - specific reporting Please select the best fit for your research . If you are not sure , read the appropriate sections before making your selection . Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences Ecological , evolutionary & environmental sciences For a reference copy of the document with all sections , see nature . com / authors / policies / ReportingSummary - flat . pdf Life sciences study design All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative . Sample size All experiments performed in this work were repeated at least three times , unless indicated otherwise in individual figure legends . All repeats performed resulted in exact agreement or similar results . No sample size calculation were performed for in vitro experiments and sample sizes were chosen for individual experiments according to pur previous expertise . For cellular based - assays we repeat a minimun of 4 experiments in order to perform statistical analysis . For in vivo experiments using in utero electroporation we define a minimum of experimental animals based on the indications suggested in " Guidelines for the Care and Use of Mammals in Neuroscience and Behavioral Research " using the following model n = 1 + 2C ( s / d ) ^ 2 ( n is the number of animals ; C is a constant that depend on the power and statistical differences ; s is the standard deviation of the measurement and d is the differences expected in each condition ) Data exclusions No data was excluded from the analysis . Replication For immunoprecipitation experiments every time we prepared freshly made lysis buffer we stock solutions . For endogenous IP we always used a 10 cm plate containing around 7x106 cells . For IP using over expression of proteins we transfected 2 well of 6 - well plates . Transfection efficiency was observed every time to be sure to have enough material . Although initial experiments were hard to observe the co - IP , once we setup the right buffer we always observed the co - IP of Filamin A and IRE1a . For cell culture experiments , we track the passage of cells in order to used cells in similar passages and used new batch after 10 passages . Selection of cells was done every two week to always work with cells expressing WT and mutant IRE1a . Wound healing assays , transmigration and actin cytoskeleton dynamics were done almost at same days or weeks to ensure reproducibility . Since working with tunicamycin is complicated since freezing cycles affects the stability of the molecule we always used small aliquots that only have been thawed once in order to ensure reproducibility . Randomization For in utero electroporation samples were devided in control and the experimental condition based in the position in the uterine horns . Left side of the uterine horns were injected with control conditions always . The experimental condition was injected in pups in the right side of the horns . No randomization was done Blinding Quantification of actin bundles by EM and the GFP % neurons in the in utero electroporation experiments were done blinded .

For the antibodies used for IP , the antibody was tested using the over expression of tagged proteins . All antibodies used for indirect inmmunofluorescence we performed primary and secondary antibodies control in addition to used en knockout cells . Eukaryotic cell lines Policy information about cell lines Cell line source ( s ) MEF IRE1 WT and knockout cells were provided David Ron .

All other cells used including HEK - 293 ( ATCC ) , MDA - 231 , HT22 , HELA and HCT116 were obtained from the University of Chile . The cell line U2OS was obtained from Guido Kroemer laboratory . Authentication Since cell lines were obtained from animals in a previously described publication and their are not commercially available we did not performed any cell line authentication . We surely perform validation of knockout cells by PCR and western blot of selected proteins . To evaluate the activity of IRE1a mutants we performed XBP1 mRNA splicing assay as described in methods . Mycoplasma contamination All cells were negative for mycoplasma contamination . All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination using the EZ - PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit ( Biological Industries ) .
