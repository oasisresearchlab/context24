In 100 - nm extruded liposomes containing 50 mM MnCI2 , water exchange between internal and external solutions was monitored via changes in the linewidth of the 170 water resonance of external water . Liposome size and shape were characterized by light scattering methods and determination of liposome trapped volume . At 250C , the following water permeability coefficients were determined : 18 : 0 - 18 : 1n - 9 PC , 155 ± 24 , tm / s ; 18 : 0 - 18 : 3n - 3 PC , 330 ± 88 , um / s ; and 18 : 0 - 22 : 6n - 3 PC , 412 ± 91 , tm / s . The addition of 1 M ethanol reduced permeability coefficients to 66 ± 15 , um / s for 18 : 0 - 18 : ln - 9 PC and to 239 ± 67 , um / s for 18 : 0 - 22 : 6n - 3 PC . Furthermore , the addition of 50 mol % 18 : 1n - 9 - 18 : 1n - 9 PE reduced the water permeability from 122 ± 21 , um / s for pure 18 : 1n - 9 - 18 : 1n - 9 PC to 74 ± 15 , um / s for the mixture . The significant increase in water permeation for membranes with polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains correlates with looser packing of polyunsaturated lipids at the lipid - water interface and the suggested deeper penetration of water into these bilayers . Ethanol may block water diffusion pathways by occupying points of water entry into bilayers at the interface . The addition of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine increases lipid packing density and , consequently , reduces permeation rates . INTRODUCTION Lipid bilayers are excellent dialysis membranes , represent - ing an invincible obstacle for ion diffusion , but allowing rapid permeation of solutes such as water or ethanol . Water is known to permeate the membrane with relative ease , even in the absence of special water channels , allowing nature to regulate cell volume rapidly ( Finkelstein , 1987 ) . Water permeability across lipid bilayers has been studied for more than 25 years by a variety of experimental methods ( Disalvo et al . , 1989 ; Finkelstein , 1987 ; Deamer and Bram - hall , 1986 ; Fettiplace and Haydon , 1980 ) . It was observed that rates of water permeation are higher for liquid crystal - line lipids than for the gel state ( Fettiplace and Haydon , 1980 ) . Furthermore , water permeation depends on mem - brane lipid composition , e . g . , lipid headgroups , chain length and unsaturation , and cholesterol concentration ( Paula et al . , 1996 ; Jansen and Blume , 1995 ; Koenig et al . , 1992 ; Ye and Received for publication 8 January 1997 and in finalform 21 April 1997 .

It has been suggested that polyunsaturated membranes like those found in brain synaptosomes and the retina are particularly permeable to water , but their perme - ability coefficients have not been measured yet . In recent studies conducted at our laboratory , the bio - physical properties of a series of mixed - chain polyunsatu - rated lipids with one to six double bonds in the sn - 2 chain have been investigated ( Barry and Gawrisch , manuscript submitted for publication ; Separovic and Gawrisch , 1996 ; Holte et al . , 1995 ) . We studied sn - I chain order as a func - tion of sn - 2 chain unsaturation and concluded that polyun - saturated lipids occupy a larger area per lipid in the bilayer , which may ease penetration of water molecules ( Holte et al . , 1995 ) . Looser packing of unsaturated lipids and , perhaps , deeper water penetration have been also detected by dif - fraction methods ( Wiener and White , 1992 ; Simon and McIntosh , 1986 ) . Furthermore , fluorescence measurements on polyunsaturated lipids revealed that water content in the bilayer hydrocarbon region increases with increasing chain unsaturation ( Ho et al . , 1995 ; Slater et al . , 1993 ; Straume and Litman , 1987 ) . Ethanolamine headgroups result in phospholipid bilayers that are more tightly packed ( Thurmond et al . , 1991 ; Lafleur et al . , 1990 ) . Smaller cross - sectional areas in PC also result when PE is mixed with PC ( Barry and Gawrisch , manu - script submitted for publication ; Separovic and Gawrisch , 1996 ; Fenske et al . , 1990 ; Lafleur et al . , 1989 , 1990 ) . Following the previous argument that water permeability through membranes is strongly related to packing density of lipids , one would expect lower water permeability coeffi - cients for mixed PC / PE compared to pure PC membranes . 855 Volume 73 August 1997 The addition of ethanol may alter water permeation be - cause of ethanol ' s influence on lipid order . Ethanol in lipid bilayers binds to the lipid - water interface region , including lipid phosphate groups , glycerol , and upper hydrocarbon chain regions ( Holte and Gawrisch , 1997 ; Barry and Gaw - risch , 1994 , 1995 ) . Interface binding increases separation between lipid molecules , which increases the motional free - dom of lipid hydrocarbon chains ( Barry and Gawrisch , 1994 ; Taraschi et al . , 1985 ) . Lower lipid order is expected to translate into higher water permeation rates . However , ethanol molecules compete with water for the same binding sites at the lipid - water interface and may interfere with water entry into bilayers . Water permeability of bilayers in the presence of ethanol has been investigated , but results from different laboratories appear to contradict each other . Whereas recent experiments on model membranes by Jansen and Blume ( 1995 ) and Lahajnar et al . ( 1995 ) found decreased water permeability in the presence of ethanol , previous investigations on cell membranes reported in - creased permeability ( Inoue et al . , 1985 ; Seeman et al . , 1970 ) . Absolute membrane water permeability coefficients are measured with great difficulty . Relative differences in water permeability typically have good reproducibility , but abso - lute values measured at different laboratories by different experimental techniques may deviate , even in the order of magnitude ( Haines and Liebovitch , 1995 ) . This divergence reflects the hardship in calibrating a permeation measure - ment and , perhaps , specific membrane perturbations caused by the experimental approach . Our NMR experiments on water permeation rely on para - magnetic ion - induced differences in water relaxation ( Swift and Connick , 1962 ) . The range of water permeation coef - ficients that can be measured with NMR depends critically on the magnitude of change in the relaxation rate . Fast water permeation , as in polyunsaturated lipids , requires particu - larly short relaxation times that are not accessible with the ' H NMR signal of water at modest concentrations of para - magnetic ions . The 170 NMR signal of water has excep - tional sensitivity for spin - spin relaxation time , T2 , to Mn2 + concentration and is therefore better suited for measure - ments on polyunsaturated lipids . Isotopic enrichment is not required for most experiments because modem high - and medium - field spectrometers detect the 170 NMR signal of water at natural abundance . In most previous 170 NMR experiments the relaxation time of water outside liposomes or cells was shortened and the exchange - mediated relaxation effect on trapped water inside the particles was measured ( see , e . g . , Haran and Shporer , 1976 ; Conlon and Outhred , 1972 ) . This approach requires trapped water volumes of 10 % or higher , which translates into very high lipid concentrations . A more suit - able method is the one by Lipschitz - Farber and Degani ( 1980 ) , which uses entrapped Mn2 + inside small sonicated vesicles . We modified the experiment by trapping the Mn2 + ions inside 100 - nm extruded liposomes . This radius of cur - ture on lipid packing but small enough to guarantee forma - tion of single - walled unilamellar liposomes ( Noy et al . , 1995 ; Mui et al . , 1993 ; Fenske and Cullis , 1993 ; Mayer et al . , 1986 ) . Calculated permeation rates depend on the pre - cise determination of lipid concentration , liposome - trapped water volume , and liposome stability , which were investi - gated in parallel to the permeation experiments . At a con - centration inside liposomes of 50 mM MnCl2 , permeability coefficients in the range of 50 - 1000 , xm / s can be measured . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC , 16 : 0d3 - 18 : 1 PC , 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC , 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PE , and 22 : 6 - 22 : 6 PC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . The polyunsaturated lipids 18 : 0 - 18 : 3 PC and 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC were obtained from Matreya ( Pleasant Gap , PA ) . Lipids were used without further puri - fication . Lipid purity of the docosahexaenoic acid - containing lipids was checked by high - performance liquid chromatography , using a light scat - tering detector , and judged to be 98 % . To prevent oxidation of lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids , the antioxidant butylated hydroxy - toluene ( BHT ) was added at a molar lipid / BHT ratio of 250 / 1 , and sample preparation and experiments were conducted with degassed solvents under an argon atmosphere . Anhydrous 200 proof ethanol was purchased from Pharmco Products ( Brookfield , CT ) . Sample preparation 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC , 16 : 0d3l - 18 : 1 PC , and 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC were weighed into plastic vials as dry powders and hydrated as described below . Mixed PC / PE samples and polyunsaturated PCs were prepared from lipid chlo - roform or methylene chloride solutions . The organic solvent was removed under a stream of argon . The remaining lipid film was dispersed in water , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and lyophilized at a pressure of 100 , um Hg for a minimum of 8 h . Liposome samples ( 1 wt % ) were prepared in either 50 mM MnCI2 to record the permeation process , or in a 72 . 9 mM NaCl solution ( environ - ment A , Fig . 1 ) . The manganese - containing sample was used to measure T2 , and the sodium sample was used to determine T2A ( see Eq . 1 ) . Both solutions yield an osmolarity of 134 ± 1 mOsmol / kg , as measured with the Advanced Osmometer 4995 ( model 303 ; Advanced Instruments , Norwood , MA ) . Before extrusion , samples were freeze - thawed five times with liquid nitrogen . Unilamellar liposomes were produced by a three - step extrusion process through polycarbonate filters ( Nuclepore Filtration Products , Cam - bridge , MA ) , using an extruder ( Lipex Biomembranes , Vancouver , BC , Canada ) operated with argon as previously described ( Mayer et al . , 1986 ; Hope et al . , 1985 ) . Dispersions were extruded three times through 400 - nm filters , three times through 200 - nm filters , and six times through 100 - nm filters . Lipids extruded in either MnCl2 or NaCl were dialyzed against a 72 . 9 mM NaCl solution in the same beaker for 20 h , using a double - sided biodialyzer ( Sialomed , Columbia , MD ) . The solution was changed three times during dialysis . This procedure removes bulk manganese from so - lution while maintaining an identical ionic composition in the outer solu - tion for both types of samples . For lipid species containing more than one double bond per chain , the entire sample preparation was carried out in an argon atmosphere . Liposome size determination The mean diameters and size distribution of extruded liposomes were determined by light scattering methods . Static and dynamic light scattering were measured on an instrument equipped with a BI - 200SM goniometer , a vature is large enough to prevent an influence from curva - Biophysical Journal 856 BI - 9000 AT digital coffelator , and an argon ion laser ( , k = 514 . 5 mm ) Water Permeability of Membranes FIGURE 1 Water exchanges rapidly between a pool with long relaxation times on the outside of liposomes ( A ) and a pool inside the liposomes ( B ) with short NMR relaxation times due to 50 mM MnCI2 . Approximately 105 water molecules diffuse per second across the area occupied by one lipid . The effective relaxation time , T2 , is determined by the rate of water exchange between the two pools . Powder spectra were de - Paked according to the method of Sternin et al . ( 1983 ) . The influence of Mn21 on acyl chain order was evaluated by analyzing quadrupolar splittings . Phospholipid concentration After completion of measurements , the lipid concentration in the samples was determined by 3 ' P NMR . To obtain well - resolved isotropic resonance lines , lipids were solubilized in the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate ( 400 mM ) containing 0 . 1 mM EDTA . An aliquot of Na2HPO4 in D20 was added to the sample for use as an internal 31P intensity standard and to lock the magnetic field strength with a deuterium lock . High - resolution 3 ' P NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DMX500 spectrometer ( Bruker Instruments ) operating at 202 . 4 MHz , using a spec - trum width of 10 kHz . Phosphorus signals from lipid headgroups ( PC , PE ) and inorganic phosphorus were well separated ( Colman and Gadian , 1976 ) and could be easily integrated by a peak - fitting procedure ( Xedplot ; Bruker Instruments ) . Permeability measurement The permeation process was treated as an exchange of water between two pools ( Fig . 1 ) , the external pool ( A ) , with a long relaxation time ( T2A ) and the internal ( B ) , with a short relaxation time ( T2B ) due to the presence of paramagnetic Mn21 ions . The effective relaxation time , T2 , of external water depends on T2A , T2B , and the lifetime of water inside the liposomes , TB , according to 1 f I = B + TB T2 T2B + TB T2A ( 1 ) manufactured by Brookhaven Instruments Corp . ( Holtsville , NY ) . Data for each sample were acquired in triplicate at angles of 300 , 450 , 600 , 900 , 1200 , and 1500 between incident and scattered light beams . The lipid concentration for this measurement was 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 wt % . Measurement of trapped volume VB Liposomes extruded in the presence of electrolyte are reported to be nonspherical ( White et al . , 1996 ; Clerc and Thompson , 1994 ; Mui et al . , 1993 ; Lichtenberg et al . , 1981 ) . Therefore , the hydrodynamic liposome diameter does not provide liposomal trapped volume . The amount of trapped water was calculated from the Mn21 concentration in the extruded liposome dispersion after dialysis and liposome lysis by Triton X - 100 . The Mn2 + concentration was measured by a colorimetric Mn2 + assay ( Spect - roquant Manganese ; Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) . The NMR experiments gave no indication for Mn21 leakage from the extruded liposomes . It was assumed that the Mn21 concentration inside the liposomes did not change from the initial value of 50 mM during extrusion and dialysis . Influence of Mn2 , on lipid packing Samples of 16 : Od3l - 18 : 1 PC , perdeuterated in the sn - I chain , were prepared in H20 , 50 mM MnCl2 , or 50 mM CaC12 solutions . Preparations were freeze - thawed and extruded as described above . After ultracentrifugation at 100 , 000 X g for 3 h , the pellet was transferred to glass tubes and freeze dried . Samples were rehydrated in deuterium - depleted water to the initial water content and equilibrated at 50C for several days . 2H NMR powder spectra were acquired on a Bruker DMX300 spec - trometer ( Bruker Instruments , Billerica , MA ) at 46 . 1 MHz using a high power probe with a 5 - mm solenoidal sample coil . A quadrupolar echo sequence ( Davis et al . , 1976 ) was used with two 1 . 8 - , us 900 pulses and an interpulse delay of 50 jus . Between 10 , 000 and 30 , 000 scans were accu - mulated at a spectral width of 200 kHz . ( Andrasko and Forsen , 1974 ; Swift and Connick , 1962 ) . The ratio of internal to external water volume is given by the factorf ( f = VB / VA ) . This equation assumes that resonance lines in environments A and B have the same chemical shift , confirmed experimentally for 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC . Further - more , a size distribution of the liposomes modifies Eq . 1 in such a way that f and TB must be replaced by expressions that sum over all volume ratios , fj , and lifetimes , TBi , that occur according to the liposome size distribution function . This scenario was modeled and resulted in deviations of only 1 - 2 % from permeability coefficients calculated from average values of f and TB . Therefore , the influence of size distribution was neglected . High - resolution natural - abundance 170 NMR spectra of water were accumulated on a Bruker DMX300 spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 40 . 7 MHz , using proton broadband decoupling . Typically , 1024 scans were accumulated with a repetition delay time of 100 ms . The relaxation times T2 and T2A were directly obtained from the Lorentzian fit of the lineshape . To determine the relaxation time of the internal water , T2B , 10 mg of 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC was dispersed in 51 . 6 , ul of 50 mM MnCl2 solution , which yielded the same lipid - to - water ratio throughout the sample as inside the 100 - nm unilamellar liposomes . The MnCl2 solution contained 10 % H2170 / 90 % H20 ( Cambridge Isotope Labs , Andover , MA ) for detec - tion of this severely broadened signal . The dispersion was freeze - thawed 10 times and stored for 2 - 3 days at 50C for equilibration . T2B was measured with a Hahn - echo pulse sequence with a between - pulse delay of 10 , us , using a solids probe . Free induction decays were left - shifted and Fourier transformed with a line broadening of 100 Hz . For comparison , T2B was also obtained from a lineshape fit . The permeability coefficient , Pd , was computed according to VB Pd - = ( 2 ) VB is the internal volume of the liposomes , and A is their surface area . The trapped volume , VB , was measured by the Mn2 + assay as described above , the surface area was calculated using the values of area per molecule shown in Table 1 , and the lipid concentration was determined by 3 P NMR .

In a recent study on 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC and 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC con - ducted at our laboratory , somewhat smaller areas per molecule have been determined ( Koenig et al . , manuscript submitted for publication ) . The activation energy , EA , for the permeation process was computed from the slope of a plot ln Pd versus IIT , according to Pd ( 7 ) = Poe ( ART ) ( 3 ) RESULTS Water permeability coefficients depend on accurate deter - mination of trapped water volume ( see Eq . 1 ) . Liposomes are deformed by shear forces in the extrusion process ( Clerc and Thompson , 1994 ) . If extrusion is performed in an electrolyte solution , the liposomes remain nonspherical be - cause water influx to convert liposomes into spheres would result in an osmotic stress gradient between inside and outside solutions , which is energetically unfavorable . Liposome characterization Liposome size The size and shape characteristics of the extruded liposomes were measured by static and dynamic light scattering . All extruded liposome samples are found to have relatively narrow , unimodal , hydrodynamic diameter distributions . The mean liposome hydrodynamic diameter varied from 92 to 127 ± 36 nm . The diameter remained constant over a period of 72 h , which indicates that no vesicle aggregation or fusion occurred during preparation and measurement . Assuming an ellipsoidal shape for the liposomes as a model , the ratio of major to minor axes was calculated from the differences between static and dynamic light scattering . The resulting parameters yielded vesicle - entrapped volumes that agree with the trapped Mn2 + measurement reported below . The addition of 1 M ethanol does not influence the size and shape of extruded liposomes . Trapped volume The progress of liposome dialysis was monitored by deter - mination of T , proton relaxation time for water in the dialysis solution . Dialysis was judged to be complete after - 18 h , indicated by no further increase in relaxation times . The 170 NMR spin - spin relaxation time , T2A , is very sen - sitive to traces of Mn2 + ions in the outer solution . The measured T2A values indicate that the Mn2 + concentration in the outer solution was lowered by about three orders of magnitude during dialysis . Within experimental error , the T2A values remained unchanged during the time course of the experiment , confirming that no leakage of Mn2 + ions had occurred . The amount of external Mn2 + that remained after dialysis was one to two orders of magnitude lower than the amount of trapped Mn2 + inside the liposomes and , therefore , did not perturb the measurement of liposome - trapped water volume . Values of trapped water volume ( given in , ul of trapped water per mg of lipid ) are shown in Table 1 . Typically , these values are - 20 - 40 % smaller than volumes calculated assuming a spherical shape of the lipo - somes . There is a tendency for 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PE - containing liposomes to have a larger trapped volume . Apparently these liposomes assume a shape that is less asymmetrical than those formed by pure PCs . Unilamellarity of extruded liposomes Liposomes extruded through 100 - nm pores are reported to . be unilamellar ( Noy et al . , 1995 ; Mui et al . , 1993 ; Mayer et al . , 1986 ) . A control measurement was performed on 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC . The 31p spectrum of extruded liposomes prepared in 72 . 9 mM NaCl solution was accumulated . Addition of 5 mM MnCl2 broadened the phosphorus signal of the outer leaflet beyond detection . Integration of the remaining signal revealed that - 50 % of the signal was eliminated , confirm - ing that our liposomes are unilamellar . Perturbation of lipid order due to the influence of Mn2 + 2H NMR on sn - i chain deuterated 16 : 0d3l - 18 : 1 PC was employed to confirm that the addition of 50 mM MnCl2 does not alter lipid packing . Fig . 2 shows the powder and de - Paked spectra of 16 : 0d31 - 18 : 1 PC prepared in a ) H20 , b ) 50 mM MnCl2 , and c ) 50 mM CaCl2 . Within experimental error ( ± 100 Hz ) , the 2H NMR spectra in the presence of water and MnCl2 are identical . However , the addition of 50 mM CaCl2 resulted in a 5 % order increase . Membrane permeability The 170 NMR spin - spin relaxation times T2 , T2A , and T2B were measured as a function of temperature . Fig . 3 shows the temperature dependence of all three relaxation times for a 1 wt % 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC preparation . The values for T2A are slightly shorter than values for pure 72 . 9 mM NaCl solution because of traces of Mn2 + that have not been removed during dialysis . T2B of the water signal in the internal pool ( Fig . 3 B ) is also reduced by binding of water molecules to the lipid surface . Bound water molecules have longer mo - 858 Biophysical Journal Water Permeability of Membranes c ) 10 lklz c ) b ) 5 kHz FIGURE 2 2H NMR powder spectra ( left ) and de - Paked spectra ( right ) of 16 : 0d31 - 18 : 1 PC at 25°C . Lipids were prepared in water ( a ) , 50 mM MnCl2 ( b ) , and 50 mM CaCl2 ( c ) . The addition of 50 mM Mn2 + did not change quadrupolar splitting ; however , 50 mM Ca2 ' increased the hydro - carbon chain order by 5 % . tional correlation times , which translates into shorter relax - ation times . Therefore , for the measurement of the internal relaxation time , T2B , the lipid / water ratio had to be adjusted , 6 5 - 4 - 2 - 1 - 0 - reproducing exactly the environment inside of a liposome ( 210 water molecules per lipid of the inner leaflet for 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC ) . T2A becomes longer with increasing tem - perature because of shorter water correlation times at higher temperatures . T2 , however , decreases with increasing tem - perature , indicating the fast exchange of water across the membrane and the related loss of magnetization due to much faster relaxation inside the liposomes ( Eq . 1 ) . Lipid bilayers are generally characterized by very low permeability to mono - and divalent ions . However , a dra - matic increase in the permeability of ions occurs at the phase transition from gel to liquid - crystalline ( Mouritsen et al . , 1995 ; Papahadjopoulos et al . , 1973 ) . Our permeability measurements were conducted well above the phase transi - tion temperature of the lipids to avoid leakage of Mn2 + . Acyl chain unsaturation Fig . 4 shows the influence of chain unsaturation and tem - perature on water permeability . Permeability coefficients increase drastically with the introduction of more double bonds from 155 + 24 , um / s for 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC to 662 ± 189 gtm / s for 22 : 6 - 22 : 6 PC at 25°C . The perme - ability coefficients of 18 : 0 - 18 : 3 PC and 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC are about a factor of 3 higher then those of 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC , but no significant differences between the two polyunsaturated lipids were found . Activation energies of water permeabil - ity , EA , increase slightly with increasing unsaturation .

At this temperature 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC is in the gel phase ( Niebylski and Salem , 1994 ) , where water permeability is much lower ( Jansen and Blume , 1995 ; Fettiplace and Haydon , 1980 ) . We calculated a lifetime of water inside the vesicles of TB = 18 ± 3 ms and a permeability coefficient of Pd = 0 . 62 + 0 . 15 , gm / s . Permeability coefficients of this magnitude cannot be mea - sured with the 170 NMR method , because the difference in the linewidth is too small to be resolved . Water permeability of PC / ethanol mixtures The influence of ethanol on water permeability is shown in Fig . 5 . The addition of 1 M ethanol decreases permeability coefficients of 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC to almost half of the value measured in the absence of ethanol . The same effect is observed for the highly unsaturated 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC . Mea - surement of the permeability coefficient began at 15°C to prevent vesicle fusion , which may occur in the presence of ethanol at lower temperatures ( Komatsu and Okada , 1995 ) . Ethanol slightly reduces the thermal activation energy of water permeation . The reduction is larger for 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC than for 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC . pure 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC bilayers , as shown in the two lower curves in Fig . 6 . Activation energy of water permeation increases from 9 . 9 kcal / mol for pure 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC to 12 . 9 kcal / mol for the mixture . In contrast , water permeation of 18 : 1 - 22 : 6 PC remains almost unperturbed by the presence of equimolar 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PE . Finally , the lifetime of water inside the vesicles and the permeability coefficients at temperatures from 5°C to 40°C were calculated for all nine lipid preparations ; these are shown in Table 2 . DISCUSSION The permeation results support the hypothesis that water permeability across polyunsaturated bilayers is significantly higher than across saturated and monounsaturated bilayers . Measurements on polyunsaturated membranes are challeng - ing because of lipid sensitivity to oxidation and special requirements of the experimental method for measuring short lifetimes of water inside liposomes . The 170 NMR method with Mn2 + ions trapped inside liposomes , initially used by Lipschitz - Farber and Degani ( 1980 ) on sonicated small unilamellar liposomes , is very well suited for mea - surement of fast water permeation through highly unsatur - ated phospholipid bilayers . Permeation measurements on liposomes " loaded " with Mn2 + ions have the highest sen - Water permeability of PC / PE mixtures Water permeability of 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC / 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PE mixtures ( 1 / 1 , mol / mol ) is significantly reduced in comparison to T ( K ) 8 7 T ( K ) 8 7 I - - , cn t I - - , , I : : $ 0 - 4 r . 6 5 4 - 3 320 310 300 - , 0 . 003 1 290 280 0 . 0032 0 . 0033 0 . 0034 0 . 0035 0 . 0036 1 / T ( K - 1 ) FIGURE 5 Permeability coefficients of 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC ( O , * ) and 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC ( V , V ) with ( - , V ) and without ( C ] , V ) 1 M ethanol versus temperature .

Permeability coefficients of the mixture are 20 - 70 % smaller than those of pure PC . The activation energy of water permeation for the 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC / 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PE mixture is somewhat higher than for pure 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC .

Permeability measurements have the highest precision for water lifetimes inside liposomes from 15 to 150 As , translating into permeability coefficients of 70 - 700 , um / s . # The activation energy error was calculated from the standard deviation of experimental data points to the linear fit of ln Pd versus lIT . sitivity , at lipid concentrations near 1 - 2 wt % . Extrusion at such low lipid concentration results in more uniform unila - mellar liposomes with less tendency for aggregation , fusion , or leakage of internal electrolyte . Measurement of fast water exchange , as in the case of polyunsaturated membranes , requires short relaxation times , T2B . This can be achieved with a high concentration of relaxation agent ( Koenig et al . , 1992 ) or , as in our experi - ments , by observing the resonance signal of natural - abun - dance 170 in water , which is more sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic ions . T2 relaxation times have been deter - mined by fitting the 170 resonance lineshape with a Lorent - zian function . Resonance lines appear to be homogeneously broadened , and a linewidth analysis results in smaller ex - perimental errors than a measurement of T2 relaxation times by a Carr - Purcell - Meiboom - Gill pulse sequence . 170 NMR experiments must be conducted with proton decoupling to remove unresolved scalar coupling between water protons and oxygen ( lJOH 90 Hz ) , which broadens the 170 reso - nance line ( Earl and Niederberger , 1977 ; Burnett and Zelt - mann , 1974 ) . Because divalent ions bind to neutral lipid surfaces ( Lis et al . , 1981a , b ) , the influence of the paramagnetic Mn2 + ions on the lipid chain order was measured . Although it was reported that Ca2 + and Mn2 + bind to about the same extent to 16 : 0 - 16 : 0 PC ( Lis et al . , 1981a ) , lipid chain order is not influenced by Mn2 , but is increased because of Ca2 . We conclude from this measurement that the 50 mM MnCl2 solution is unlikely to influence the permeability measurement . The value of water permeability coefficients depends critically on accurate determination of trapped water vol - ume . In previous investigations , trapped water volume has been determined from average liposome size , assuming that the liposomes are spheres ( Jansen and Blume , 1995 ; Koenig et al . , 1992 ; Spineni et al . , 1983 ; Haran and Shporer , 1976 ) . However , it has been shown by others ( White et al . , 1996 ; Mui et al . , 1993 ; Clerc and Thompson , 1994 ; Lichtenberg et al . , 1981 ) , and was confirmed in this study , that extruded liposomes are nonspherical , resulting in an internal water volume that is 20 - 40 % lower than that of a spherical particle with identical hydrodynamic radius . This may ex - plain why our calculated water permeation coefficients for monounsaturated lipids are slightly higher than values pub - lished previously ( Koenig et al . , 1992 ; Haran and Shporer , 1976 ; Reeves and Dowben , 1970 ) . Our values for 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC and 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC are in excellent agreement with recently published data by Paula et al . ( 1996 ) . Water permeability and unsaturation Increasing lipid hydrocarbon chain unsaturation enhances diffusion - controlled water permeability of phospholipid bi - Huster et al . 861 Volume 73 August 1997 layers . Increased rates of water permeation are related to differences in lipid packing . This general rule does not apply to the transition from 18 : 0 - 18 : 3 PC to the more unsaturated 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC , where more unsaturation results in a marginal increase of permeability coefficients only . The sixfold unsaturated docosahexaenoic acid chain ( 22 : 6 ) has four more carbon atoms than the three - fold unsaturated a - linolenic acid . Most likely the degree of unsaturation and the chain length of the unsaturated chain determine water permeation rates . As revealed by 2H NMR order parameter profiles , the sn - 1 chain exhibits a selective increase in motional freedom in a region located toward the bottom half of the chain as sn - 2 unsaturation increases ( Holte et al . , 1995 ) . This corre - sponds to an area increase around carbon atom 14 that is three to four times greater than the increase for the top part of the chain , and may result in an interface regime that is less tightly packed . Thus the capability of water to penetrate the lipid - water interface may be enhanced for polyunsatu - rated lipids , resulting in increased water permeability . This model is supported by molecular dynamics studies on lipid bilayers . In these simulations the area occupied by glycerol and the upper part of lipid hydrocarbon chains exerts the main resistance to water permeation , because of higher free energy and lower diffusion rates of water ( Marrink and Berendsen , 1994 , 1996 ; Marrink and Berkowitz , 1995 ) . We suggest that polyunsaturation lowers resistance to water permeation in the critical upper third of lipid hydrocarbon chains . Influence of the ethanolamine headgroup PEs have higher chain order than PCs ( Lafleur et al . , 1990 ; Sternin et al . , 1988 ) . The chain order of PCs increases when PEs are added to the mixture ( Barry and Gawrisch , manu - script submitted for publication ; Separovic and Gawrisch , 1996 ; Fenske et al . , 1990 ; Lafleur et al . , 1989 , 1990 ) . Order increase with addition of PE to PC is biggest in mixtures of saturated and monounsaturated lipids and much smaller for polyunsaturated lipids ( Barry and Gawrisch , manuscript submitted for publication ; Separovic and Gawrisch , 1996 ) . Increased order is equivalent to higher lipid packing density and smaller area per molecule ( Separovic and Gawrisch , 1996 ) , which reduces interchain water concentration , as observed in fluorescence measurements ( Stubbs et al . , 1995 ) . In good agreement with these observations , water permeation is significantly lower in equimolar mixtures of 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PC / 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PE , and somewhat lower in 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC / 18 : 1 - 18 : 1 PE . Water permeability and ethanol Whereas polyunsaturation reduces hydrocarbon chain order and increases water permeation , the addition of 1 M ethanol also reduces hydrocarbon chain order but reduces water Stubbs and colleagues ( Boni et al . , 1993 ) suggest that water concentration increases in membranes containing ethanol , therefore eliminating the possibility that lower water con - centration inside the membrane hydrophobic core limits water permeation . However , ethanol may also reduce water permeation by restricting entry of water molecules into the bilayer . Because of its amphipathic nature , an ethanol mol - ecule has the lowest free energy when located at the lipid water interface . In recent NMR investigations we measured ethanol location in bilayers by two - dimensional NOESY spectroscopy and summarized results as an ethanol distri - bution function ( Holte and Gawrisch , 1997 ) . Ethanol con - centration is highest at the lipid - water interface near the glycerol and decreases toward the center of the bilayer and the upper end of headgroups . We hypothesize that ethanol limits the dynamic access of water molecules to the bilayer by blocking diffusion pathways of water into the membrane core . CONCLUSIONS We observed that perturbation of lipid packing by chain polyunsaturation and headgroup composition , as well as modifications of the lipid - water interface region by ethanol , influence diffusion - controlled water permeability . The activation energy of water permeation in the range of 8 - 12 kcal / mol , measured in this study , is much higher than the 4 . 6 kcal / mol characterizing the self - diffusion of water ( Wang et al . , 1953 ) and higher than the 4 - 6 kcal of acti - vation energy for water permeation through the CHIP 28 pores in erythrocyte membranes ( Benga , 1994 ) . The higher values suggest that water molecules interact with the lipid matrix during the course of water transit , which is in better agreement with the solubility diffusion model of water permeation ( Finkelstein and Cass , 1968 ; Hanai and Haydon , 1966 ) than with the hypothesis of water diffusion through pores . In its recent modification , called the inhomogeneous sol - ubility - diffusion model , the complexity of a phospholipid membrane is reproduced by dividing the membrane into four regions with different properties of membrane - solubi - lized water ( Marrink and Berendsen , 1994 , 1996 ; Marrink and Berkowitz , 1995 ) . Resistance to water permeation is highest in the area containing the upper hydrocarbon chains . Lower chain order as a result of chain unsaturation ( Holte et al . , 1995 ) correlates with increased water permeation , whereas higher order , as in PE - containing membranes ( Separovic and Gawrisch , 1996 ) , decreases permeation rates . The lower water permeation rates in the presence of ethanol can be explained with a model whereby ethanol and water compete for identical polar binding sites in the lipid - water interface region .
