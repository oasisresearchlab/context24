Materials and Methods : A retrospective , secondary database review study was conducted . The information was collected from an epidemiological surveillance activity in close contacts ( co - inhabitants ) in 52 households in Metropolitan Lima with only one member with COVID - 19 . A reevaluation was carried out in 10 households . Epidemiological and clinical variables were evaluated and its association with the result of the rapid serological test ( presence of IgG , IgM or both ) . Results : Secondary cases were found in 40 households , which represents an average of 49 . 9 % identification per household . A secondary attack rate of 53 . 0 % ( 125 cases ) was found among cohabitants , with 77 . 6 % of cases being symptomatic ( symptomatic / asymptomatic ratio : 3 . 5 ) . The presence of fever and / or chills was found in 40 . 0 % of people with a positive result , followed by a sore throat , in 39 . 2 % . Ageusia and anosmia were present in 22 . 4 % and 20 . 8 % of cases , respectively . A reevaluation in 40 family members 33 . 6 ± 2 . 7 days after the first evaluation , show the persistence of positive IgM and IgG in the 20 positive cases in the first evaluation . Conclusion : Having a primary case of COVID - 19 in home , the secondary attack rate of this infection is 53 % ; however , in a significant proportion of households evaluated there was no positive case , beyond the primary case . The epidemiological and clinical characteristics found in this case were in accordance with what has already been reported in other international series .

In Peru , the first case of COVID - 19 was identified on March 6 , 2020 , while the first two deaths occurred thirteen days later [ 2 , 3 ] . Three months later , the country exceeds 260 000 cases and reports more than 8 700 deaths [ 4 ] . One of the most important characteristics of COVID - 19 , is the dynamics of transmission due to highly effective mechanisms . The infection agent is usually propagated through the airway or by contact of secretions ; therefore , the human - to - human transmission has turned into the main dissemination path to be considered during the pandemic [ 5 ] . Previous studies have determined that SARS - CoV - 2 has an average reproduction number ( R 0 ) of 2 . 2 , but it range from 1 . 4 to 6 . 5 ; however , these estimates may vary according to the study context [ 6 , 7 ] . Close - to - case contacts , such as family members , relatives , or friends , are those who are most at risk of contracting the infection and , therefore , can be sources of contagion for others who come in contact with them . This chain of contagion is reinforced by the fact that a percentage of the infected population can act as asymptomatic carriers of the virus , making it difficult for them to be identified by health systems [ 8 ] . In this regard , an effective way to break the chain of transmission of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus is through epidemiological surveillance and follow - up of all those who were in close contact with a confirmed case [ 9 , 10 ] . This process is called “contact tracing” . Some previous experiences have used these strategies to evaluate the transmission dynamics between COVID - 19 cohabitants . A study carried out in China remarks that there was a correlation between confirmed cases in other communes in Hubei province and the number of migrants from Wuhan , who usually travel to visit their family . [ 11 ] . Likewise , Liu et al . ( 2020 ) , showed that family reunion events became important sources of contagion in some provinces of China , so they recommend that public health interventions should consider specific measures to reduce contact in cohabitants [ 12 ] . Additionally , previous research have found an increase between 7 - 10 times in secondary attack rates , when studying only the people who cohabit the home with the primary case , compared to the calculated rate when they include all contacts [ 13 , 14 ] . However , the evidence is still divergent among regions and countries where close contact studies are taking place . In Latin America , the weakness of the health systems and the lack of financial resources are added to the difficulty in following cases and contacts for this disease [ 15 ] . In our country , centralism is an additional factor ; thus , the capital ( Metropolitan Lima ) , concentrates approximately 60 % of reported national cases . Additionally , within it , districts with high and low proportion of cases have been identified , which have varied over time [ 4 ] . Although a previous study has been found that preliminarily analyzes the dynamics of the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Lima [ 16 ] , no analyzes have been found that evaluate the information of activities that have involved the monitoring of contact clusters narrow , as are the people who live in the same household , considering the case burden by districts of residence . Therefore , the objective of the present study is to describe the characteristics of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among household members with a confirmed primary case of COVID - 19 in low burden districts in Metropolitan Lima .

Population and sample The study population was defined as the totality of contacts with a serological test result for COVID - 19 . We include contacts with complete epidemiological records with IgG / IgM results , made by National Institute of Health ( NIH ) personnel , included in the epidemiological surveillance of households were selected . Those contacts who do not cohabit in the home of the primary case were excluded . Therefore , this study is considered a census type . Epidemiological surveillance In the context of pandemic control and surveillance , the National Institute of Health ( INS ) carried out an epidemiological surveillance activity in households with a single primary case COVID - 19 ( identified by RT - PCR ) , between April 23 and May 2 , 2020 . This evaluation was carried out , on average , 13 . 6 ± 3 . 7 days after the diagnostic test . In order to avoid distortions in data produced by a community transmission scenario , this activity was carried out in the districts with the lowest burden of disease in each of four health areas of Metropolitan Lima , called Directorates of Integrated Health Networks ( DIRIS , for its acronym in Spanish ) , until surveillance of 10 households in each DIRIS was reached . In addition , 10 households in the district of Metropolitan Lima with the highest burden at the time the surveillance began was evaluated . Subsequently , as part of the surveillance , 10 households from one of the DIRIS were re - evaluated , on average 33 . 6 ± 2 . 7 days after the first evaluation . The serological test used was Coretests ® COVID - 19 IgM / IgG Ab Test ( Core Technology Co . Ltd ) , a lateral flow immunochromatographic test that qualitatively detects the presence of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 , with a sensitivity and specificity reported by the manufacturer for IgM / IgG of 97 . 6 % and 100 % , respectively . Variables The study considers a main variable called SARS - CoV - 2 infection , and defined as the presence of antibodies ( IgM , IgG or both ) in people who had not previously being tested with a positive result ( RT - PCR or rapid serological test ) . The positive cases were classified in turn , according to the presence / absence of symptoms . Likewise , information was collected on the number of members in the household , evaluation time , defined as the time in days between the issuance of the index case result and the first evaluation ; and time of illness , characterized as the time in days ( reported by the patient ) from the onset of symptoms to the day of evaluation . Socio - demographic characteristics of the household members ( age , gender , presence of health professionals ) , and clinical characteristics ( presence of symptoms and risk conditions ) were also described . In this regard , the presence of cough , sore throat , nasal congestion , fever , general discomfort , respiratory distress , diarrhea , nausea / vomiting , headache , irritability / confusion , pain in general , among others , were considered as symptoms ; while the following were included as risk conditions : age greater than or equal to 60 years , hypertension ( HT ) , cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , obesity , asthma , chronic lung disease , chronic kidney failure ( CKF ) , disease or immunosuppressive treatment , cancer , pregnancy or postpartum , being a health professional or others that the health personnel consider convenient to register [ 17 ] .

This evaluation was carried out in a differentiated way , expressing simple measures for the information of the subjects in general ; while , to identify the values of the people within each household , average measures were used considering the variability that exists in each household according to the density of its members . Analyzes were repeated for reevaluated individuals and households to identify changes over time . All calculations were performed with the statistical software Stata v . 16 . 0 ( Stata Corporation , College Station , Texas , USA ® ) , and Microsoft Excel 2016 ® . Ethical aspects Due to the use of secondary data analysis for this study , the investigation represents a minimal risk to the study participants . The study has the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee for Research from the National Institute of Health . RESULTS Records of 326 people were evaluated , in which 54 . 7 % ( n = 129 ) were women , with an average age of 36 . 2 ± 20 . 1 . The 37 . 3 % had some risk condition ( n = 88 ) , being the most frequent belonging to the risk age group older than 60 years ( n = 35 , 39 . 8 % ) , followed by HT ( n = 20 , 22 . 7 % ) and bronchial asthma ( n = 14 , 15 . 9 % ) . Regarding the clinical characteristics , 68 . 6 % presented some sign and / or symptom ; highlighting the presence of sore throat ( 49 . 4 % ) , while fever and / or chills , as well as cough occurred in 41 . 4 % of people . Of all the subjects , 53 . 0 % were identified as a secondary case infection , finding 15 people only with positive reaction to IgM , and 110 with reaction for both IgM and IgG . No patients were found who only exhibited a positive reaction to IgG . Among secondary cases , it was observed that 77 . 6 % were symptomatic , the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic secondary cases was 3 . 5 ( Table 1 ) . Similar age was found among people classified by results ( positive / negative ) and by symptoms ( symptomatic / asymptomatic ) . The 40 . 2 % of the symptomatic cases and 32 . 1 % of the asymptomatic had some risk condition , being the most frequently found characteristic , belonging to the age group over 60 years , in both groups . Among the evaluated signs and symptoms , fever and / or chills were found in 40 . 0 % of the people with a positive result , followed by sore throat , in 39 . 2 % . Ageusia and anosmia were present in 22 . 4 % and 20 . 8 % of cases , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . The type of immunoglobulin detected was similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic secondary cases ( Table 2 ) . The 236 people evaluated belonged to 52 households , finding a density of 4 . 5 ± 2 . 5 members for each household ; considering the variability in the number of members per household , it was found that 54 . 1 % of the members were women , 34 . 7 % of the members per household had some risk condition , and 68 . 1 % presented some sign and / or symptom . On average , 49 . 9 % of the members of each household were identified as a secondary case for COVID - 19 . Of the 40 households that presented secondary cases , in 9 ( 22 . 5 % ) all of its members had a positive result . Additionally , on average , 39 . 4 % of the members of each household were symptomatic secondary cases , and the ratio of finding symptomatic secondary cases was 3 . 8 with respect to the asymptomatic ones ( Table 3 ) . When evaluating the characteristics of the households according to the positivity of its members , it was found that in those where all of its members were positive , 66 . 7 % were women , while where all were negative was 55 . 0 % . Regarding conditions of risk , a higher frequency was found as households had more positive members ( Table 4 ) . The reevaluation was conducted in 40 people distributed in 12 households 33 . 6 ± 2 . 7 days after the first evaluation . The average age of the people included was 34 . 2 ± 17 . 2 years .

On the first visit , an average of 1 . 9 ± 1 . 4 inhabitants per household had any sign and / or symptom ( 59 . 2 % ) of COVID - 19 , while in the reevaluation there were 0 . 9 ± 0 . 5 ( 41 . 6 % ) . In the first evaluation , 1 . 8 ± 1 . 5 positive cases per household were found ( 57 . 0 % ) , while for the re - evaluation this average was 2 . 0 ± 1 . 5 ( 65 . 6 % ) , and the ratio of positive cases in the members per household went from 1 . 33 to 1 . 91 . All IgM + IgG positive cases in the first evaluation showed positive IgM + IgG in the reevaluation . The only case reactive only to IgM in the first evaluation , also present IgG for the second evaluation . Additionally , three new cases were identified that were initially negative and on the second visit exhibited positive reaction for IgM and IgG . The average of positive symptomatic cases per household , on the first visit , was 1 . 3 ± 1 . 4 ( 44 . 6 % ) ; and on the second visit was 0 . 8 ± 0 . 4 ( 37 . 4 % ) . The ratio of symptomatic positives to asymptomatic ones changed from 3 . 60 to 1 . 33 . ( Table 5 ) DISCUSSION This research found a secondary attack rate among cohabitants of 53 . 0 % , which is higher than that found in other research evaluating the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in similar clusters . The study that obtained similar results to those shown in our study was that of Wu et al . ( 2020 ) , in which 148 close contacts in China were evaluated , all cohabitants of a primary case . In the publication , a secondary attack rate of 32 . 4 % was found ( 95 % CI 22 . 4 % - 44 . 4 % ) [ 18 ] . In other countries such as China , the United States or Korea , secondary attack rates in cohabitants ranged from 4 . 6 % to 17 . 0 % . However , it should be considered that these estimates are affected by the sample size obtained , which was from a minimum of 151 to a maximum of 2 , 370 cohabitants of confirmed cases . [ 13 , 19 – 21 ] . This divergence can be explained by the social and cultural differences between the countries in which these studies have been carried out , as well as the measures of social isolation and quarantine applied by the country . It should be mentioned that no history of similar studies has been found in Latin America , so the true magnitude of the influence of these factors on the progression of COVID - 19 transmission in the home environment is not known . Another explanation for these results is the time elapsed between the detection of the primary case and the secondary case , which in this investigation was an average of 13 days . Guan et al . ( 2020 ) found , in a follow - up of contacts living in the same home , that 13 days after the detection of the first case , more than half of the secondary cases had already been identified [ 22 ] . Similarly , Qian et al ( 2020 ) showed 88 . 8 % detection of secondary cases in the same household , in a follow - up carried out in China . [ 23 ] . The secondary cases had an average age of 36 . 1 ± 20 . 1 years and 54 . 7 % were female cases . This distribution is consistent with that found by the results of the systematic review by Lovato and De Phillips ( 2020 ) , which found 42 . 5 % of male cases and a mean age of 49 . 1 years . [ 24 ] . Likewise , it is similar to reports by the National Center for Epidemiology , Prevention and Control of Diseases ( CDC - Peru ) , which mentions that , in Peru , 59 . 9 % of cases are distributed in an age range between 30 - 59 years and 41 . 8 % in male patients [ 25 ] . The 38 . 4 % of positive cases reported at least one risk conditions , according to current regulations in Perú [ 26 ] . The most frequent risk condition was age older or equal to 60 years ( 18 . 4 % ) ; similar to the official information of the CDC - Peru ( 17 . 3 % of cases older than or equal to 60 years ) [ 25 ] . Davies et al ( 2020 ) , estimate that 69 % of cases in older adults present clinical symptoms , while the susceptibility to infection decreases by half in people under 20 years of age . [ 27 ] .

Previous research is contradictory regarding the frequency of cases of HT found in patients with COVID - 19 , being reported from 1 . 9 % [ 28 ] to 17 , 4 % [ 24 ] ; while the antecedent of asthma varied between 8 . 8 % - 12 . 5 % [ 29 , 30 ] , similar to that found in this research , and to that reported in Metropolitan Lima ( 18 - 19 % ) by other researchers [ 31 , 32 ] . Finally , the frequency of T2DM , found in this research is consistent with that found by Tabata et al . ( 2020 ) [ 28 ] ; although it is higher than that reported by other studies , in which the frequencies are 3 % , on average [ 24 , 33 ] . The triad of symptoms most frequently found was fever , sore throat and cough , observed in approximately 40 - 50 % of symptomatic positive cases . These findings are consistent with previous studies that show that fever and cough were the most frequent symptoms present in up to 80 % of cases . [ 24 , 34 ] . Bi et al . ( 2020 ) found a statistically significative relation with a PR : 3 , 06 [ IC 95 % 1 , 69 - 5 , 49 ] between the finding of fever and the detection of COVID - 19 [ 19 ] . Although , previous reports indicates that IgM emergence is prior of IgG , and they are positive during the first - second week after the onset of symptoms [ 35 ] . Because of that , it should be considered in the current context , that the appearance of suggestive clinical characteristics , such as those previously mentioned , should lead to a rational diagnostic suspicion , with the decision to apply a test only to confirm it . Additionally , 22 . 4 % of the symptomatic cases presented ageusia and 20 . 8 % , anosmia . The evidence is not yet clear regarding the frequency of these findings in cases of COVID - 19 , some investigations estimate its presence in more than 50 % of cases [ 36 ] however , this is not supported by national evidence provided by CDC - Peru , which reports a frequency of 1 . 1 % anosmia and 0 . 3 % ageusia [ 25 ] . The information bias that may exist must be considered , since these symptoms were not frequently consulted in the epidemiological evaluation of cases . However , it was evidenced that 92 . 9 and 90 . 3 % of the contacts with these symptoms were positive to the serological test . Additionally , Patel et al . ( 2020 ) reported that 58 % of cohabiting contacts in patients with anosmia and COVID - 19 [ 36 ] . Future studies should better assess the characteristics related to the appearance of these symptoms and transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . This research found 22 . 4 % of positive cases asymptomatic , which is similar to the proportion of 29 % reported by CDC - Peru [ 25 ] . Likewise , this is consistent with what was found in other contact surveillance studies , such as the one carried out by Bi et al ( 2020 ) , in China , where 20 % of secondary cases were asymptomatic [ 19 ] ; and by Hao - Yuan et al ( 2020 ) , in Taiwan , who calculated 18 . 2 % of secondary asymptomatic cases [ 37 ] . On the re - evaluation of cases , it was found that although the frequency of people with symptoms fell , the ratio of positive cases rose from 1 . 33 to 1 . 91 . This is consistent with the reevaluation time ( more than 30 days on average ) , since the sensitivity of the detection of antibodies in the population increases proportionally to the time of illness [ 38 ] . Despite this , no significant number of seroconversions were found in people who were negative in the first evaluation , and the IgM persisted positive . It should be noted that in this research , households have also been characterized as units of measurement , establishing corrections in epidemiological indicators for household density . This consideration is extremely important if a contact study is carried out in specific conglomerates such as houses , especially in a non - random selection mode , as in this case . Thus , in 23 . 1 % of the homes evaluated , no positive case was found , with an average density of 4 . 5 ± 2 . 5 people per home and 3 . 7 ± 3 . 1 people in the homes where all the members were positive . This density was similar and would not explain the absence or increased infection of contacts in these households . Jing et al ( 2020 ) , carried out a similar experience , finding 65 % of households without positive cases , with a median of members per household of 6 ( 4 - 10 ) people ; however , they did not analyze the characteristics of households with positive cases [ 21 ] . Additionally , and as expected , there was found an important difference between the percentage of people with symptoms in households with all positive contacts , compared to households with all negative contacts ( 83 . 6 vs . 48 % ) .

This research has important limitations to consider : the selection of the households in the epidemiological surveillance activity was carried out for convenience , so the results presented cannot be extrapolated to the general population . Likewise , there was no component of temporality for all the cases , which does not allow establishing whether the cases called " asymptomatic " were actually pre - symptomatic cases . The reevaluation activity could not be carried out in all the households initially included , which adds an important selection bias and reduces the external validity of the conclusions that can be obtained from these data . Despite this , due to not finding similar antecedents in Latin America , this study presents results that can serve as a basis for future research that generates knowledge about the dynamics of household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Finally , it is concluded that having a primary case of COVID - 19 in the home , the secondary attack rate of this infection is 53 % ; however , in 23 % of the homes evaluated there was no positive cases , beyond the primary case . The epidemiological and clinical characteristics found in this study were in accordance with what has already been reported in other international series . Similarly , the proportion of asymptomatic patients found ( 22 . 4 % ) is consistent with that evidenced by previous publications and the national epidemiological data . Likewise , the persistence of positive IgM is evident in the reevaluation of cases on average 30 days later .
