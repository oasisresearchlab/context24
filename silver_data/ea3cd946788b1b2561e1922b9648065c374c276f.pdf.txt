An Enzyme That Removes Clathrin Coats : Purification of an Uncoating ATPase DAVID M . SCHLOSSMAN , SANDRA L . SCHMID , WILLIAM A . BRAELL , and JAMES E . ROTHMAN Department of Biochemistry , Stanford University Medical School , Stanford , California 94305 ABSTRACT (cid:9) Uncoating ATPase , an abundant 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide mediating the ATP - dependent dissociation of clathrin from coated vesicles and empty clathrin cages , has been purified to virtual homogeneity from calf brain cytosol . Uncoating protein is present in cells in amounts roughly stoichiometric with clathrin . This enzyme is isolated as a mixture of monomers and dimers , both forms being active . ATP can support protein - facilitated dissocia - tion of clathrin at micromolar levels ; all other ribotriphosphates as well as deoxy - ATP are inactive . The clathrin that is released from cages consists of trimers ( triskelions ) in a stoichio - metric complex with uncoating ATPase . These complexes with clathrin have little tendency to self - associate at neutral pH , and at acidic pH they interfere with the assembly of free clathrin . The possible existence and function of these complexes as clathrin carriers in cells would explain why uncoating protein is made in quantities equivalent to clathrin . Clathrin - coated vesicles transport selected sets of membrane - associated macromolecules between subcellular compart - ments ( 6 , 10 , 13 , 25 - 30 ) . Isolated coated vesicles have offered fruitful opportunities for structural study ( 3 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 24 , 39 , 41 , 42 , 46 , 47 ) , but as inert objects they can only provide limited insights into the dynamic mechanisms that underlie intracellular transport . Can purified coated vesicles be activated in vitro to function as they do in cells ? Coated vesicles can be regarded as inter - mediates in a transport cycle ( 30 ) that happen to be trapped during their isolation . Thus , addition of suitable cellular com - ponents to isolated coated vesicles may engage them to pass through subsequent steps in the cycle , offering at once a means to identify the needed components , to elucidate unknown steps in the pathway , and to study the mechanisms involved . In this paper we illustrate this approach and describe the purification of the first enzyme believed to facilitate intracel - lular protein transport . Shortly after budding of a coated vesicle , and apparently before fusion of the vesicle with its target , clathrin appears to be removed from the membrane ( 1 , 13 , 28 , 44 ) . We have reported ( 23 ) that the high speed supernatant fraction ofbrain possesses an ATP - dependent activity that rapidly disassembles clathrin coats . In this and the following paper ( 5 ) we describe the purification and characterization of the protein responsi - ble for this activity . Because this 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide uses the hydrolysis ofATP to drive the energetically unfavor - THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 99 AUGUST 1984 723 - 733 0The Rockefeller University Press - 0021 - 9525184 / 08 / 0723111 $ 1 . 00 able release of the clathrin from coats , we have termed this activity " uncoating ATPase .

Purification of Coated Vesicles , Clathrin Triskelions , and Empty Clathrin Cages Calfbrains were frozen on dry ice within 15 min of slaughter and stored at - 80°C . Crudemembrane vesiclefractionswere prepared ( 16 ) ; these werefurther purified in some cases to obtain coated vesicles using sucrose or Ficoll - 1320 gradients ( 24 , 27 ) . To prepare Clathrin , either crude membranes ( 21 ) or coated vesicles ( 16 ) wereextracted in buffer E at 4°C for 60 min , centrifugedat 100 , 000 g , for 60 min , and the supernatant precipitated with ammonium sulfate ( 30 % ofsaturation ) . The precipitate , redissolved in 8 ml ofbuffer F ( but not dialyzed ) was chromatographedon a 3 - x . 115 - cm ( 800 - ml ) column of Sepharose 4B ( 33 ) equilibrated in buffer F ( flow rate about 40 ml / min ) . The Clathrin containing fractions ( located by SIDS PAGE ofcolumn fractions ) were pooled , and Clathrin was precipitated with ammonium sulfate ( 50 % of saturation ) , redissolved in buffer F at a protein concentration of 10 mg / ml , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored as aliquots at - 80°C . As reported ( 16 ) , these preparations consisted mainly ofClathrin ( 180 , 000 mol wt ) and light chains ( 33 , 000 and 36 , 000 mol wt ) , although contaminants ( e . g . , the 100 , 000 - 110 , 000 - mol - wt family ofcoated vesicle proteins ) were present up to 10 % of the total . The procedure yielded - 15 mg of Clathrin per kiligram of brain tissue ( when coated vesicles were extracted ) and - 40 mg ofClathrin perkiligram oftissue ( when crudemembranes were extracted ) . This " column - purified Clathrin " was reassembled into empty cages by dialysis into buffer A for 12 - 16 h at 4°C as described ( 16 , 23 , 32 ) . Synthesis of 3 H - Clathrin and Preparation of 3H - Empty Cages Clathrin was labeled by reductive methylation with formaldehyde and NaB [ ' H ] 4 according to the procedure of Tack et al . ( 37 ) . Typically , 0 . 2 ml of buffer F containing 2 mg of Clathrin was dialyzed extensively against 0 . 2 M Na - borate buffer ( pH 8 . 9 ) , transferred to a microfuge tube and held on ice for 30 min to thoroughly equilibrate the temperature . Then 15 Al of 0 . 2 M formaldehyde in water and 10 gi of 0 . 12 M NaB ( ' H ] 4 in 0 . 01 N NaOH ( 8 . 4 Ci / mmol ) were added sequentially , and the tube was held on ice for an additional 10 min . The reaction was then terminated by addition of 10 / if of 0 . 5 M ( NH4 ) 2SO4 , and the labeled Clathrin was separated from unbound radioactivity by filtration over a 10 - ml column ofSephadex G - 25 equilibrated in buffer F . Fractions of0 . 6 ml were collected andthe labeled protein peak was located and pooled . The final product , typically - 1 . 4 mg of ' H - Clathrin ( 1 - 2 x I0 5 cpm / lag ; 90 % trichloroacetic acid precipitatee ) , was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored as aliquots at - 80°C . For use in assays , the ' H - Clathrin triskelions were mixed with unlabeled triskelions to achieve a final specific activity of 1 - 5 x 10 ' cpm / lag , and then dialyzed against buffer A to form ' H - empty cages , The cages were pelleted by centrifugation at 95 , 000 g , for 10 min in an airfuge ( Beckman Instruments Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) ( A 30 / 100 rotor ) , and the pellet ( containing 80 - 90 % of the starting material was resuspended in buffer C and preincubated at 37°C for 10 min to release a pool of poorly assembled Clathrin that would otherwise contribute to the background in the release assay . The remaining cages ( 30 - 40 % of total ) were pelleted in the airfuge , and resuspended in buffer A at 1 - 2 mg / ml . These " preincubated " ' H - empty cages , now stable to further incuba - tions in buffer C , were indistinguishable from standard preparations of unla - beled empty cages by electron microscopy , agarose gel electrophoresis ( 3I ) , polypeptide composition , and limited tryptic hydrolysis ( 32 ) . Possibly , some of the ' H - Clathrin molecules , damaged by the labeling procedure , are unable to assemble normally but co - polymerize with unlabeled Clathrin to render a fraction ofthe final cages defective and unstable . Assay of ATP - dependent Release of 3 H - Clathrin Incubations ( 50 ul final volume ) contained ATP ( 2 . 5 nmol ) and the protein fraction to be tested ( 0 . 25 - 1 ug of pure uncoating ATPase ; 10 - 40 ug of crude cytosol ) in 45 ul ofbuffer C . Reactions were initiated by adding 5 Al of buffer A containing either 5 or 10 ug of preincubated ' H - empty cages . To stop the incubation ( usually after 5 min at 37°C ) , we degraded free ATP by adding 5 JAI of a mixture ofyeast hexokinase ( 100 U / ml ) and glucose ( 50 mM ) in buffer C . After a further incubation of45 s at 23°C , samples were chilled on ice , diluted to 120 ul with ice - cold buffer C , and the remaining cages were pelleted in the airfuge at 95 , 000 g for 10 min . The top half ( 60 Al ) ofeach supernatant was 724 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 99 , 1984 counted for ' H , and the percent of total Clathrin released was calculated as twice this radioactivity divided by the total added to the assay . The background ofspontaneous release of ' H - Clathrin into the supernatant was measured in parallel incubations in which ATP was omitted and the hexokinase - glucose cocktail was added at the start of the incubation . This background was 10 ± 5 % of the total ' H in the assay . All of the values for ATP - dependent Clathrin release reported in this paper have had this " minus ATP " background subtracted . Similar backgrounds were also obtained when cages were incubated in buffer without uncoating protein . Purification of Uncoating ATPase All operations were at 4°C unless otherwise noted . STEP 1 : CRUDE CYTOSOL . (cid:9) Frozen calfbrains ( - 500 gm ) were thawed overnight at 4°C in 1 liter of buffer D , rinsed , and then homogenized in 1 ml / gm offresh buffer D by three 15 - s pulses in a Waring blender . The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 14 , 000 rpm in a Beckman JA - l4 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . ) , and the supernatant was further centrifuged for 60 min at 45 , 000 rpm in a Beckman Type 45 Ti rotor . This high speed supernatant ( - - 400 ml ) was dialyzedfor 8 h against 20 literof25 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 0 ) , centrifuged for 60 min at 45 , 000 rpm in the 45 Ti rotor , and dialyzed for 12 h against a second 20 - literportion of25 mM Tris ( pH 7 ) . Crude cytosol at this stage could be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C for up to 6 mo without detectable loss of activity . ST E P 11 : DE A E - CE LLU LOSE . (cid:9) The dialyzed cytosol wasappliedat a flow rate of 150 ml / h to a 4 - x - 18 - cm ( 225 - ml ) column of Whatman DE - 52 equilibrated with 25 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 ) , and the column was washed ( flow rate 250 ml / h ) with 200 ml of 25 mM Trís ( pH 7 ) followed by 450 ml of25 mM Tris ( pH 7 ) containing 50 mM KCI . No activity was found in these fractions . The column was then eluted with 25 mM Tris ( pH 7 ) containing 150 mM KCI at a flow rate of 250 ml / h and 8 - ml fractions were collected and assayed for ATP - dependent Clathrin releasing activity . Uncoating activity emerged as a broad peak between 120 and 280 ml of this buffer . STEP 111 : HYDROXYLAPATITE . (cid:9) The pooled active fractions ( 160 ml ) from step II were applied at a flow rate of 100 ml / h to a 2 . 5 - x - 25 - cm ( 125 - ml ) hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris - HCI , ( pH 7 ) , 150 mM KCI . The column was washed with 150 ml of 20 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 ) followed by 250 ml of 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 ) containing 50 mM potassium phosphate ( pH 7 ) . The column was then eluted with 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 ) containing 150 mM potassium phosphate ( pH 7 ) at a flow rate of 150 ml / h , and 6 - ml fractions were collected and assayed for ATP - dependent release of Clathrin as described . This activity emerged in a broad peak between 114 and 222 ml of elution . STEP Iv : ATP - AGAROSE . The peak fractions from step III ( 108 ml ) were dialyzed for 12 h against 4 liter of buffer C and then applied at a flow rate of 60 ml / h to a 1 . 5 - x - 16 - cm ( 28 - ml ) column of ATP - Agarose equilibrated in buffer C . The column was then washed successively with 60 - ml portions of buffer C , buffer C containing 1 M KCI , and buffer C again . These fractions contained most ofthe protein but did not contain significant activity and were discarded . The column was then eluted with buffer C containing I mM ATP at a flow rate of 60 ml / h , and 8 - ml fractions were collected and assayed for activity . These fractions were , of course , no longer nucleotide - dependent be - cause of the ATP present in the buffer ; therefore , ' H - Clathrin released in an incubation containing cages and ATP but no column fraction was subtracted as background . Activity emerged as a broad peak between 32 and 128 ml of the ATP eluate . STEP v : ( NH4 ) 2SO4 PRECIPITATION . (cid:9) Acombined ammonium sulfate precipitation and an EDTA treatment served to concentrate the activity and to restore ATP - dependence in the release assay by removing tightly bound Mg - ATP . The pooled active fractions from step IV ( 96 ml ) were adjusted to 4 mm EDTA ( from a 200 mM stock ) . After about 15 min , solid ( NH , ) 2SO4 was gradually added to achieve 75 % of saturation , and the mixture was stirred for 30 min . The precipitate was collected at 100 , 000 ga , for 1 h and redissolved in a minimum volume ( - 2 ml ) ofbuffer C . This fraction , consisting ofessentially pure protein ( - 2 mg / ml ) was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C after dialysis against buffer C . The frozen protein was stable for months at - 80°C , and when thawed , aliquots typically retained uncoating activity for up to 2 wk at 4°C . Other Methods SIDS PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli ( l8 ) using 10 % poly - acrylamide / 0 . 1 % SDS gels unless otherwise specified . For quantitation , gels stained with Coomassie R - 250 or autoradiographs were scanned with a densi - tometer ( Quickscan [ Helena Laboratories , Beaumont , TX ] ) . Electron micros - copy was performed as previously described ( 23 ) . Protein was determined as described by Bradford ( 4 ) , using bovine serum albumin as the standard . RESULTS Assay of Uncoating Activity Assay of ATP - dependent release of ' H - clathrin into the supernatant was approximately linear with protein up to 20 Ag / ml of purified uncoating ATPase ( or 800 ug / ml of crude cytosol ) . Under these conditions , the assay was also linear with time up to 7 . 5 min of incubation ( Fig . 1 ) . Clathrin and light chains were released together ( Fig . 2 ) and seemed to be free of proteolysis , since we could detect no net loss of ' H , decrease in molecular weights , or change in the molar ratio of clathrin heavy chains to light chains . Purification of Uncoating ATPase Uncoating ATPase was purified 38 - fold from bovine brain cytosol using a combination of DEAE - cellulose , hydroxylapa - tite , and ATP - agarose column chromatography ( Table 1 ) . The product was a single polypeptide chain of 70 , 000 mol wt that was > 95 % pure as measured from densitometer tracings of SDS polyacrylamide gels ( Fig . 3 ) . Mixing experiments did not reveal activators ofpurified uncoating ATPase activity present in crude cytosol that might have made us overestimate total activity at the start of purification . We were surprised that such a modest degree of purification was necessary , implying that the uncoating ATPase was abun - dant . We were therefore concerned as to whether the major protein we had purified was in fact responsible for the un - coating activity . The evidence in support ofthis , and a possible explanation for the abundance of this protein based on our findings , is provided in the Discussion . The major step in the purification was the ATP - agarose affinity column , whose use was suggested by the unusually low K for ATP evident from our earlier work with crude cytosol ( 23 ) . The DEAE cellulose step served principally to concentrate the activity , but also afforded a threefold purifi - cation . The hydroxylapatite step removed a major 45 , 000 - s (cid:9) ts (cid:9) is W (cid:9) TIME ( min ) WQ IU e B 4 i A FIGURE 1 (cid:9) Assay for ATP - dependent release of clathrin .

Trace amounts of an 135 , 000 - mol - wt contaminant were also pres - ent . After the ATP - agarose step , the uncoating protein was found to be ATP - independent in the clathrin - release assay . This is due to tightly bound ATP that resists dialysis ( our unpublished observations ) acquired during elution from the ATP - agarose column . ATP - dependence could be restored by adding EDTA ( 4 mM ) to remove the tightly bound Mg - ATP , followed by dialysis or gel filtration on Sephadex G - 25 . Rou - tinely , this was combined with an ammonium sulfate precip - itation , as described in Step V of the purification scheme in the Materials and Methods section , but an additional G - 25 desalting step was sometimes necessary . Properties of Uncoating ATPase The subunit molecular weight of the uncoating ATPase protein , under denaturing conditions , was determined by SDS PAGE ( 45 ) to be 70 , 000 ( Fig . 3 , lane D ) . However , native uncoating ATPase consists principally of a mixture of mon - omers and dimers as judged from its pattern of elution from SCHLOSSMAN ET AL .

Arrows indicate the migration positions of reference proteins ( not shown ) with molecular weights as follows ( x 10 - 3 ) : Escherichia coli ß - galactosid - ase ( 116 ) , phosphorylase b ( 93 ) , transferrin ( 77 ) , bovine serum albumin ( 67 ) , ovalbumin ( 43 ) , and carbonic anhydrase ( 30 ) .

Sephacryl S - 300 in assay buffer ( Fig . 4A ) . Protein and activity both eluted in two major peaks corresponding to apparent molecular weights ( for spheres ) of 100 , 000 and 220 , 000 and were recovered in 75 % yield . Cross - linking of the column fractions with glutaraldehyde followed by sodium borohydride ( Fig . 4B ) confirmed that the peak centered at fraction 54 consisted primarily of 70 , 000 - mol - wt monomer while the peak centered at fraction 49 contained a species whose migration on SDS PAGE after 726 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 99 , 1984 TABLE I Purification of UncoatingATPase Samples of the pooled active fractions from each purification step ( see Materials and Methods ) were dialyzed exhaustively against buffer C before assay . Assays contained 5 ug ' H - empty cages , andwere all confirmed to be in the linear range . 1 unit of activity is defined as the ATP - dependent release of 1 % of the ' H - clathrin into thesupernatant in 1 min . cross - linking was most consistent with a 140 , 000 - mol - wt di - mer . The possibility of a trimer could not be completely ruled out , however , because intramolecular cross - linking produces broad bands that migrate somewhat anomalously when com - pared to the uncross - linked standards . Differences in intra - molecular cross - linking were probably also responsible for the doublet seen in cross - linked monomer fractions 51 - 57 . Sub - stantial amounts of a higher molecular weight multimer ( probably tetramer ) were seen in fractions 45 and 46 . All species show activity , indicating either that they are intrinsically active or that they can interconvert during the uncoating reaction . Incubating a pool offractions 53 - 55 with ATP , ADP , or a mixture ofthe two nucleotides did not induce formation ofdetectable amounts of dimer ( Fig . 4B , lanes A - C ) . There was no detectable molecular weight difference between the material in fraction 49 and that in fraction 54 when they were run on the gel without exposure to the cross - linking reagents ( Fig . 4B , lanes D and E ) . Our preparation of 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide also focused as a single spot ( pl = 5 . 2 ) upon two dimensional SDS PAGE ( 22 ; data not shown ) . Therefore , the dimer probably consists of two identical 70 , 000 - mol - wt subunits . Siegel and Monty ( 34 ) showed that the elution volume of a protein in gel filtration correlated better with Stokes radius than with molecular weight . Using their methods , Stokes radii of 39 and 59 Á were calculated for the monomer and dimer species respectively ( Fig . 4A , inset ) . The ATP - dependent release activity of uncoating ATPase was unaffected by treatment with N - ethylmaleimide at con - centrations as high as 2 mM for 60 min at 25°C . No loss of activity was observed during incubation of uncoating ATPase at 37°C under assay conditions for up to 1 h . Coated Vesicles and Clathrin Cages as Substrates for Uncoating ATPase Uncoating ATPase was purified on the basis of its ATP - dependent ability to dissociate cages that consisted almost exclusively of clathrin heavy and light chains . Such cages are artificial substrates representing only the outermost shell of coated vesicles . Does the pure protein retain the ability of the crude cytosol ( 23 ) to uncoat coated vesicles ? Pure uncoating ATPase was incubated with calf brain coated vesicles in the presence of ATP , and an ATP regenerating system , the latter needed to overcome ATPases present in coated vesicle frac - tions ( 31 ) . The coated vesicles were indeed dissociated , but the rate of release of clathrin from coated vesicles was about I / 4 of that of clathrin cages tested under the same conditions , in which initial rates are being measured ( Fig . 5 ) . Although the initial rate of release of clathrin from coated vesicles is slower than from cages , the extent is the same , given sufficient Purification step Total protein Specific activity Total activity Purification Yield mg U1mg U ( fold ) 1 .

For example , the incubations used in Fig . 5 contained uncoating enzyme at a level of 0 . 025 pg / wg coated vesicle protein . In parallel incubations contain - ing 0 . 15 ug enzyme / Fcg coated vesicles , clathrin release was 86 % in 15 min , consistent with our earlier results for crude cystosol ( 23 ) . Also , as observed previously with crude cytosol , release via the pure uncoating protein was highly selective for clathrin and its light chains . For example , when 80 % of the clathrin had been released from coated vesicles , only - 15 % of the 100 , 000 - and 50 , 000 - mol - wt family of polypeptides had been released ( not shown ) . To test the possibility that ATP - generated ion gradients across the vesicle membrane might in some way be needed for uncoating from coated vesicles , we employed Triton X - 100 - extracted coated vesicles ( TCVs ) as substrate . These lose most of their membrane lipid but retain all of the major proteins ( 27 ) . TCVs were equivalent to intact coated vesicles in the release assay , even when assayed in the presence of Triton X - 100 ( Fig . 5 ) . Duramycin , an inhibitor of the ATP - dependent proton pump ofcoated vesicles ( 9 , 35 , 36 ) also had no effect on uncoating when used at levels up to 50 ug / 100 Ag of coated vesicles , an amount sufficient to inhibit ATP - dependent proton translocation - 80 % ( 36 ) . The initial rate of release of clathrin increased with cage concentration until a saturation was achieved ( Fig . 6A ) ; half - saturation required 0 . 14 mg / ml of cages .

Clathrin is likely to be present at this or higher concentrations in cells . Nucleotide Requirements for Clathrin Release from Cages The initial rate of clathrin release via the pure uncoating protein was measured as a function of the concentration of ATP ( Fig . 6B ) . A double reciprocal plot ofthe data ( Fig . 6 B , inset ) yielded a K , n of 0 . 9 pM ( 19 ) . Of all the nucleotides tested ( Table 11 ) , ATP was uniquely effective . Other ribonucleotides and deoxy - ATP did not sub - stitute for ATP , even at millimolar levels , at which point traces of contaminating ATP become significant . Substantial clathrin release was observed with 1 mM oftwo nonhydrolyz - able analogues AMP - PNP and ATP - y - S ( but not AMP - PCP ) . The ability of these two analogues to release clathrin was largely resistant to hexokinase and glucose treatment ( Table 11 ) under conditions in which added radioactive ATP is quan - titatively converted to ADP ( data not shown ) . This suggests that the observed release is a direct effect of the analogues and not traces of contaminating ATP . ADP and AMP were inactive . pH Dependence of Clathrin Release Because both coated vesicles and clathrin cages are known to dissociate spontaneously on exposure to pH levels 7 . 5 and above ( 15 , 16 , 40 , 43 , 46 , 47 ) , the pH dependence of sponta - neous and ATP - dependent clathrin release from empty cages and coated vesicles was carefully investigated . Spontaneous release of clathrin from empty cages incubated in the absence of ATP was quite substantial above pH 7 . 0 ( Fig . 7A , open circles ) . Release in the presence of ATP increased rapidly above pH 6 . 6 ( Fig . 7A , closed circles ) . The ATP - dependent component of release ( Fig . 7A , inset ) was maximal between 30 20 10 r (cid:9) I (cid:9) i (cid:9) I 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 0 CAGE CONCENTRATION ( np / ml ) FIGURE 6 (cid:9) Dependence of clathrin release on substrate concentra - tions .

' Control experiments showed that 1 mM ATP - PNP did not inhibit theability of the hexokinase / glucose cocktail to degrade as little as 1 uM ATP in 30 s at 37°C . pH 6 . 8 and 7 . 2 . The pH dependence of clathrin release from coated vesicles was similar to that observed with empty cages , except that for coated vesicles release in the absence of ATP did not become substantial until pH 7 . 4 and above ( Fig . 78 ) . The data in Fig . 7B reflect initial rates of clathrin release and thus differ somewhat from our previous data on the pH dependence ofclathrin release ( reference 23 , Fig . 2 ) where the extent of release was measured at the various pH values . Dependence of Clathrin Release upon Monovalent and Divalent Cations A broad optimum was observed for KCl ( Fig . 8A ) , and release was stimulated by including up to 10 mM ( NH4 ) 2SO4 ( Fig . 8 B , filled circles ) . This was an effect of NH4 ' and not S04 2 - as NH4Cl gave similar results ( Fig . 8B , open circles ) . Since release assays contained no membranes , the effect of NH4 ' did not involve any change in pH gradients . Rather , stimulation was direct and probably independent of the well known mechanisms ( 6 ) by which NH4 ' acts in vivo . Mg " was inhibitory > 1 mM ( Fig . 9 ) . However , Mg " was only required in amounts about equivalent with ATP ( ATP was 50 juM in Fig . 9 ) , suggesting that the major role played by Mg " lies in its chelation to ATP . Manganese was similar although inhibition began at 0 . 5 mM and was more precipi - tous . Calcium ion did not substitute for Mg " at any concen - tration . Properties of Clathrin Released from Cages via Uncoating ATPase What is the oligomeric state of the clathrin released from cages via the uncoating protein and ATP ? At one extreme , clathrin could be released as fragments of cages that simply do not sediment under the rather arbitrary conditions em - ployed in the assay . At the other extreme , an ATP - dependent process could release clathrin as monomers rather than as the trimers ( " triskelions " ) produced when physical - chemical con - ditions favor spontaneous cage disassembly .

Incubations at 37°C for 5 min were carried out in the presence of 50 kM ATP ( " ) or the presence of 10 U / ml hexokinase and 5 mM glucose ( O ) .

Assays in which the buffer C was adjusted to the indicated pH value contained 1 . 2 jig of un - coating ATPase and 10 Ag of coated vesicles . For pH values below pH 6 . 8 , the HEPES in buffer C was replaced by 20 mM MES titrated to the appropriate pH . Control experiments showed that MIES itself did not affect the assay . Incubations at 37°C for 10 min were carried out in the presence of 50 gM ATP and an ATP regenerating system ( " ) or the presence of 10 U / ml hexokinase and 5 mM glucose ( O ) . Release of clathrin into the supernatant was quantitated by SIDS PAGE and densitometry as described in the legend to Fig . 5 . Clathrin release in the presence of ATP but no uncoating enzyme did not differ significantly from that observed in the presence of uncoating enzyme but no ATP . Two lines of evidence demonstrate that the end product of ATP - dependent release is a trimer of clathrin . First , the released clathrin eluted from Sepharose 4B as a symmetrical peak in the position of clathrin triskelions ( Fig . 10 , filled circles ) . Second , when material in this peak was examined in the electron microscope after rotary shadowing ( 38 ) only trimeric structures were observed ( Fig . 11 ) . To our surprise , these ATP - released trimers contained stoi - chiometric amounts of bound uncoating ATPase . About half ofthe uncoating protein ( Fig . 10 , open circles ) co - eluted with the clathrin trimers , evidently bound to them . The ratio of uncoating ATPase monomer to clathrin heavy chain deter - mined by scanning gels of these fractions was constant across the clathrin peak ( Fig . 10 , inset ) . A stoichiometry of about 1 . 4 70 , 000 - mol - wt uncoating protein for every 180 , 000 - mo1 - wt clathrin heavy chain can be calculated from these data , assuming that the two species stain equally per unit of mass 0W W s sás Mi 0 X Eo . 0Wy a W W z a U S 16 12 B 18 12 B A 50 100 200 400 POTASSIUM CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION ( MM ) 0 B 11 (cid:9) 20 1 , 11 1 ~ ~ eo AMMONIUM SULFATE CONCENTRATION ( MM ) FIGURE 8 (cid:9) Effects of monovalent cations .

(cid:9) An Enzyme That Removes Clathrin Coats (cid:9) 729 á W FRACTION NUMBER FIGURE 10 (cid:9) Separation of the products of an uncoating reaction on Sepharose 4B . Unlabeled empty cages ( 4 . 3 mg / ml ) were incubated with uncoating ATPase ( 1 . 3 mg / ml ) and 0 . 7 mM ATP and an ATP regenerating system ( 22 ) in a total volume of 0 . 35 ml of buffer B for 30 min at 37°C . The reaction was stopped by addition of hexokinase and glucose and centrifuged at 95 , 000 g , for 10 min in the airfuge . The supernatant ( containing 90 % of the added protein ) was applied to a 1 - x - 30 - cm column of Sepharose 413 equilibrated in buffer B and eluted at 2 . 1 ml / h at 4°C while collecting 0 . 26 - ml fractions . An 100 - wl aliquot of each fraction was precipitated with 10 % trichlo - roacetic acid in the presence of 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 as carrier . The redissolved , neutralized precipitates were electrophoresed on 10 % polyacrylamide gels and the content of clathrin ( 180 , 000 - mol - wt band ) and uncoating ATPase ( 70 , 000 - mol - wt band ) in each fraction was quantitated from densitometer tracings of the Coomassie - stained gels . The vertical arrows indicate the peak elution positions of several reference standards which were ( from left to right ) : purified calf brain coated vesicles chromatographed in buffer A ( V . ) , authentic clathrin triskelions chromatographed in buffer F , uncoating ATPase chromatographed in buffer B , and ATP chromat - ographed in buffer B ( VI ) . The inset shows the ratio of stain in the uncoating ATPase band to stain in the clathrin heavy chain band in the column fractions , expressed as a molar ratio ( i . e . , normalized to molecular weights ) . with Coomassie Blue . The clathrin light chains also co - eluted with the heavy chains , and were recovered in the expected amounts ( 1 mol light chain per mole heavy chain ) . Although the incubation analyzed in Fig . 10 contained 0 . 3 Wg of un - coating ATPase / Ag clathrin before gel filtration , the input ratio of uncoating protein to clathrin could be varied over the range of 0 . 05 to 0 . 4 without substantially changing the result ( data not shown ) . It is probably significant that the clathrin trimers with stoichiometric amounts of bound uncoating protein eluted from Sepharose 4B in the same place as free triskelions . Evidently , the uncoating protein is positioned in the complex so as to minimally perturb its shape . Though the appearance ofthe complex in the electron microscope ( Fig . 11 ) was similar to that already published for free triskelions ( 16 , 39 ) , released trimers not infrequently had a bulge at their vertex , possibly representing bound uncoating ATPase ( Fig . 11 , arrows ) . This position at the vertex is the same region already documented 73 0 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 99 , 1984 as the location of the clathrin light chains ( 17 , 42 ) . However , triskelions prepared by standard chemical methods did not show such a bulge , even though their full complement of light chains was present ( data not shown ) . Properties of Released Clathrin Complexes Can uncoating ATPase - clathrin complexes spontaneously assemble into closed cages , as free triskelions do ? Complexes were dialyzed against buffer A under our standard conditions for the reconstitution ofempty cages and then sedimented in the airfuge . About half the protein assembled into structures that could be pelleted ( Table III ) . These structures appeared as large amorphous extended aggregates rather than closed cages when viewed in the electron microscope ( not shown ) as in earlier experiments ( 23 ) . The aggregates were very unstable under assay conditions . More than 85 % dissociated upon incubation in assay buffer ( buffer C ) for 10 min at 37°C . By contrast , only 37 % ofempty cages dissociated under the same conditions ( Table I1I ) . More than half of the authentic clathrin cages survived two succes - sive incubations ; only 10 % of the aggregates of uncoating protein - clathrin complexes were this stable . Indeed , the small fraction of aggregates that were stable to repeated incubations contained essentially no uncoating ATPase ( Table 111 ) and thus represented a subpopulation perhaps equivalent to pure clathrin . These experiments show that the complexes lack the ability of clathrin to form regular , closed cages at pH 6 . 2 , and that at neutral pH the complexes have little or no tendency to self - associate . In fact , uncoating ATPase - clathrin complexes in - terfere with the ability offree triskelions to assemble properly . Cages and aggregates electrophorese differently in agarose gels ( Fig . 12 , compare lanes D and E ) , as reported earlier ( 23 ) . When mixtures of complexes and triskelions were dialyzed into pH 6 . 2 assembly buffer , the two species co - polymerized into aggregatesofintermediate electrophoretic mobility whose value was determined by their content of enzyme - clathrin complexes ( Fig . 12 , compare lanes B , C and D ) . Evidently the complexes can interact with triskelions at acidic pH , but do so in a defective manner . These data with purified uncoating ATPase confirm the behavior documented in our earlier report ( 23 ) for clathrin released from coated vesicles by ATP and crude brain cytosol and discussed in terms of an ATP - dependent " modification " of clathrin ' s assembly properties . It now appears likely that this " modification " of clathrin consists of the noncovalent binding of stoichiometric amounts of the uncoating protein during ATP - dependent release . However , we have not yet established whether dissociation of the bound uncoating pro - tein restores native assembly properties to clathrin . It is not inconceivable that additional ATP - dependent changes in the clathrin trimer may be present as well and account for the modified assembly properties . DISCUSSION This paper describes the purification from bovine brain of a 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide that can dissociate clathrin coats in an ATP - dependent fashion . As shown in the next paper , this uncoating protein hydrolyzes ATP in the process of uncoating . To connote these properties , we have named this protein " uncoating ATPase . " Uncoating ATPase presumably facilitates intracellular transport in cells through its action TABLE III Relative Stability of Clathrin Cages and Aggregates of Clathrin - uncoating Protein Complexes Molar ratio of 70 , 000 - mol - wt uncoating pro - tein to 180 , 000 - mol Percent of (cid:9) wt clathrin heavy sedimentable protein (cid:9) chain Complexes of uncoating protein and released clathrin were isolated , pooled , and precipitated as described under Figs . 10 and 11 , except that the ( NH4 ) 2SO4 pellet was redissolved in buffer F .

First , this polypeptide enriches with activity during the purification ( Fig . 3 ) and coincides with activity on Sephacryl S - 300 gel filtration ( Fig . 4 ) ; although whether the monomer or dimer or both represents the primary active form remains to be determined . Second , this same 70 , 000 - mol - wt protein is bound in molar amounts to the released clathrin ( Fig . 10 ) . This same polypeptide is also selectively bound in stoichio - metric amounts from crude cytosol to coated vesicles during their uncoating ( see Fig . 1 , reference 23 ) , Third , as illustrated in the accompanying paper , this 70 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide has an ATP binding site whose affinity and specificity is the same as that of the ATP - dependent activity that releases clathrin . Fourth , stable complexes of ATP with this protein can be prepared ; the ATP in this complex is promptly hydro - lyzed when clathrin cages are added ( 5 ) . It was because of its surprising abundance that we were especially concerned to establish that we had indeed purified the right protein . About 4 mg of uncoating ATPase were obtained from - 500 gm of calf brain with an apparent yield of 7 % . It can be calculated that this corresponds to - 115 mg of uncoating protein per kiligram of brain tissue , roughly 0 . 1 % oftotal protein . By way of comparison , Pearse ( 24 , 25 ) estimates that clathrin also comprises - 0 . 1 % ofbovine brain protein . One possible explanation for the approximate equiv - alence of uncoating ATPase and clathrin is that much of clathrin in cells is sequestered in the form of uncoating ATPase - clathrin complexes ( as identified in Fig . 10 ) rather than in coated pits or coated vesicles . This " soluble " form of clathrin may be the pool used in assembling coated vesicles . Louvard et al . ( 20 ) have recently presented immunocyto - chemical evidence for just such a pool . Experiments are in progress to determine whether clathrin in a soluble pool is associated with uncoating ATPase . The uncoating protein was purified on the basis of its ability to dissociate clathrin cages in an ATP - dependent fashion . The pure protein retains the capacity of crude cytosol ( 23 ) to uncoat coated vesicles . However , further data will be required to determine whether this represents the protein ' s major activity in intact cells . Conceivably , however , this protein may function in cells in other capacities . For example , extensive rearrangement of clathrin lattices ( such as transitions from hexamers to pentamers ) may need to occur during coated vesicle budding ( 12 ) . The protein we have purified may cata - lyze such rearrangements in addition to ( or even instead of ) its postulated role in uncoating . The endproduct of ATP - dependent uncoating , mediated by the uncoating ATPase ( " enzymatic " uncoating ) , is a clath - rin trimer ; clathrin trimers are also released by perturbations in physical - chemical conditions , such as changes in pH ( " spontaneous " uncoating ) . The products of enzymatic and spontaneous uncoating differ in that the former contains bound uncoating ATPase and does not self - assemble into regular cages , whereas the latter lacks accessory protein and assembles correctly . The conditions in the clathrin release assay were selected to maximize the ATP - dependent release of clathrin from an empty cage substrate by any given amount of uncoating ATPase . The relative efficiencies of coated vesicles and clath - rin cages as substrates in the assay may partly reflect this selection . In addition , we do not yet know whether all of the events involved in the uncoating protein - facilitated disassem - bly ofa cage are enzymatic . For example , it may be that only a few ATP - dependent enzymatic " hits " are needed to break 732 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 99 , 1984 the cage into inherently unstable fragments that then disso - ciate spontaneously into triskelions . The rates of these spon - taneous , secondary dissociations would depend upon prevail - ing conditions such as pH and divalent cation concentration ( 14 - 16 , 42 , 45 , 46 ) so that the number of enzymatic " hits " needed to disassemble a cage might be greater the more inherently stable the cage . Alternatively , or in addition , clath - rin triskelions dissociated at only one or two of the three legs may snap back into the cage structure , increasing the number ofhits needed to effect a complete release . Conditions increas - ing cage stability could slow release due to both of these effects , perhaps explaining why clathrin is released more slowly from coated vesicles than from empty clathrín cages ( Fig . 5 ) , and why lower pH and higher Mg " slow the rate of release ( Figs . 7 and 9 ) . The empty cages used contain only clathrin and light chains and will be less stable than coated vesicles whose clathrin is additionally held in place by inter - actions with other coat proteins ( such as the 100 , 000 - mol - wt polypeptide family ) and the vesicle membrane . Clearly , how - ever , intact membrane permeability barriers are not required for uncoating , since treatment of coated vesicles with Triton X - 100 has little effect on this process ( Fig . 5 ) . Is the uncoating " ATPase " in fact an enzyme ? As illustrated in the next paper , the uncoating protein is literally an enzyme in the sense that a single uncoating protein can hydrolyze hundreds of molecules of ATP , especially under conditions that stabilize cages against spontaneous dissociation . But it would also appear , at least superficially , that the uncoating protein is consumed during uncoating , as it can be recovered stoichiometrically bound to clathrin ( Fig . 10 ) . It seems only reasonable to assume that the uncoating protein acts in re - peated rounds ofdissociation in cells . We do not yet know if , under the conditions we have employed in vitro , each un - coating ATPase can only participate in only one round or whether it is recycled . Elucidation of the properties ofthe complex ofclathrin and uncoating ATPase that can now be isolated in milligram quantities ( Fig . 10 ) should help clarify this issue . This complex may be the carrier of clathrin in the cytoplasm . Additional components may be needed to recycle uncoating ATPase from complexes , freeing the clathrin for assembly . If located on membranes , these components might serve to ensure an efficient coupling of clathrin assembly to vesicle budding . Using the complexes as substrates , it may now be possible to construct functional assays to search such for the molecules involved in later steps in the clathrin - coated vesicle cycle .
