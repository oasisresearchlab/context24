Cryo - electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl - shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint , which indirectly suggest that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other’s spatial distribution and interact functionally . Here , we use cell - attached patch - clamp electrophysiology and pressure - clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels . Our data , together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions , show that both at endogenous densities ( 1 - 2 channels / μm 2 ) , and at non - physiological densities ( 10 - 20 channels / μm 2 ) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap , Piezo1 density has no substantial effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension . The results suggest that Piezo channels , at densities likely to be physiologically relevant , inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers . We propose this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane . Keywords Mechanotransduction ; Piezo1 ; force - gated ion channel ; clustering ; cooperativity Introduction 1 Cells are constantly exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved diverse molecular 2 mechanisms that enable force detection . The rapid sensing of mechanical forces that occurs in 3 milliseconds is achieved by force - gated ion channels that convert mechanical energy into 4 electrochemical signals ( Kefauver , Ward , and Patapoutian 2020 ) . For example , Piezo1 is a 5 mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension ( T ) with high 6 sensitivity ( T 50 ~ 1 . 4 mN / m ) ( Coste et al . 2010 , Lewis and Grandl 2015 , Cox et al . 2016 , Syeda 7 et al . 2016 ) . Therefore , theoretically any mechanical disturbance of the cell membrane may lead 8 to changes in Piezo1 channel open probability ( P o ) . However , the propagation of membrane 9 tension away from its source has been shown to be relatively slow ( D ~ 0 . 024 µm 2 / s ) , poising 10 Piezo channels with the ability to efficiently and rapidly transduce only mechanical forces that 11 are nearby ( Shi et al . 2018 ) . 12 More generally , it can be said that the ability of a cell to transduce forces homogeneously 13 across the cell membrane depends critically on i ) the spatial distribution of force - gated ion 14 channels , and ii ) on their functional independence . Any substantial deviation from a uniform 15 distribution of force - gated ion channels will result in domains that fall short to detect forces 16 ( where there are no ion channels ) as well as domains that transduce forces disproportionately 17 ( where many ion channels are nearby ) . Functional interactions and / or cooperativity between 18 force - gated ion channels may further skew transduction efficiency or kinetics in a manner that 19 depends on channel density , effectively creating a patchwork of blind spots and sensitized 20 areas . 21 Experimental evidence on the spatial distribution of Piezo1 ion channels is just beginning to 22 emerge : TIRF imaging of Piezo1 channels revealed their free diffusion over the surface of live 23 neural stem / progenitor cells , indirectly suggesting channels are not tethered to other static 24 structures and that random membrane distribution may be possible . However , in the same cells , 25 Piezo1 - related activity was spatially enriched , which could arise from non - uniform distribution of 26 Piezo1 channels , variable membrane tension , or both ( Ellefsen et al . 2019 ) . STORM imaging of 27 HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP - tagged Piezo1 also suggests a non - homogenous spatial 28 distribution , but at channel densities that are likely not physiological ( Ridone et al . 2020 ) . Finally , 29 intensity distributions of GFP - tagged Piezo1 have been used to propose the existence of 30 clusters with varying numbers of channels ( Jiang et al . 2021 ) . 31 In contrast , a compelling theoretical framework predicting spatial and functional interactions 32 between nearby Piezo channels has been constructed based on cryo - em structures of Piezo1 33 and Piezo2 , which revealed their large and extremely curved dome - shaped structure ( Guo and 34 MacKinnon 2017 , Saotome et al . 2018 , Haselwandter and MacKinnon 2018 ) . Theoretical 35 calculations based on these structures suggest that Piezo1 can both sense and curve the 36 proximal membrane with a characteristic decay length extending ~ 14 nm beyond the channel . 37 The energetic cost of this membrane curvature implies that Piezo1 channels that are within ~ 3 38 decay lengths ( a “footprint” of ~ 50 nm ; see Methods ) may influence each other via multiple 39 mechanisms : opposing curvature may cause nearby Piezo1 channels to repel each other , as 40 well as influence each other’s gating properties ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon 2018 ) . Indeed , 41 imaging of vesicles containing reconstituted Piezo1 have demonstrated the ability of Piezo1 to 42 curve the membrane locally and suggested that flattening of the channel dome may directly 43 couple to channel opening , but the precise effects of membrane energetics on gating have yet 44 to be explored experimentally ( Lin et al . 2019 , Jiang et al . 2021 ) . Here , we set out to precisely 45 quantify the spatial distribution and potential functional interactions of Piezo1 ion channels 46 across multiple orders of channel densities . Specifically , we use electrophysiology and large 47 numbers of independent measurements to simultaneously quantify channel number and 48 function , including single - channel current , open probability , and pressure - sensitivity , with a high 49 level of precision . Collectively , our electrophysiological data , together with stochastic 50 simulations show that Piezo1 ion channels , at densities likely to be physiologically relevant , 51 inherently function as independent mechanotransducers . We propose this property enables 52 cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane . 53 54 Results 55 56 Piezo1 function at low channel densities 57 To simultaneously measure and thus directly correlate Piezo1 channel density with its gating 58 properties , we performed cell - attached patch - clamp electrophysiology on Neuro2A cells , which 59 natively express Piezo1 ( Coste et al . 2010 ) . We chose Neuro2A cells over human umbilical vein 60 endothelial cells ( HUVECs ; Figure S1A - C ) and other cell lines because they have among the 61 highest endogenous levels of Piezo1 expression , thus offering the highest likelihood for 62 observing any potential functional effects of local channel density on function . We then designed 63 a novel stimulation protocol that we optimized to assess Piezo1 single - channel conductance ( i ) , 64 pressure sensitivity ( P 50 ) , and number of channels ( n ) in each patch with high accuracy . Since 65 Piezo1 inactivation precludes a precise measurement of maximal current ( I max ) at negative 66 potentials , we recorded currents at + 60 mV , where inactivation is minimal ( Coste et al . 2010 , 67 Wu et al . 2017 ) . However , traditional step protocols are well - known to induce irreversible 68 changes in patch geometry owing to membrane creep , particularly at positive voltages 69 ( Suchyna , Markin , and Sachs 2009 , Lewis and Grandl 2015 ) . Indeed , a direct step to a 70 saturating pressure ( - 60 mmHg ) caused substantial changes in current due to leak and / or 71 capacitance even in patches that were later classified to have zero channels ( see below ; 72 mean  S . D . : 2 . 6  1 . 3 pA ; n = 33 patches ; Figure S2A - B ) . Consistent with this idea , the same 73 pressure step caused a similarly small , but measurable current in patches from Neuro2A - 74 Piezo1ko cells , which have been CRISPR - engineered to lack Piezo1 channels ( mean  S . D . : 3 . 8 75  1 . 5 pA , n = 15 patches ; Figure S2C ) . Consequently , a step protocol consistently overestimates 76 current and thus channel numbers ( Figure S2B ) . 77 To overcome this limitation , we instead designed a protocol in which the pressure was 78 decreased incrementally in 1 mmHg steps from 0 mmHg to - 60 mmHg in 50 ms intervals , thus 79 approximating a ramp ( Figure 1A - D ) . The total duration of this ramp is short enough to 80 minimize membrane creep ( 3 s ) , but each step is long enough ( 50 ms ) to allow pressure 81 equilibration , which occurs within ~ 7 ms ( Lewis et al . 2017 ) . Similar to the step protocol , the 82 ramp protocol elicited small background changes in current amplitude in all patches . However , 83 instead of the square - like current increases evoked by the step protocol , here the background 84 changed more steadily ( Figure 1A - D , middle ) , allowing us to perform linear background 85 subtractions for each individual patch and ultimately achieve a more reliable detection of 86 channel gating events , which were easily discerned as nearly instantaneous changes in current 87 amplitude ( Figure 1A - D , bottom ) . We are confident that the slow changes in current are 88 unrelated to Piezo gating , as we never observed channel openings during the ramp phase of 89 the protocol in 15 patches from Neuro2A - Piezo1ko cells ( data not shown ) . Ultimately , we 90 decided to use the ramp stimulus protocol followed by a brief ( 200 ms ) saturating pressure step , 91 the latter of which allowed us to confirm post - hoc that inactivation of Piezo1 at these voltages is 92 minimal ( step pulse : mean current at 200 ms = 92 . 5  14 . 2 % of peak ; n = 281 patches ; Figure 93 S2A ) . 94 Next , we focused on titrating the sizes of our patch pipettes such that a substantial fraction of 95 patches had zero channels ( Figure S2D ; see Methods for details ) . We limited our pipettes to 3 - 96 6 . 5 M  reasoning that this choice maximizes our ability to detect potential channel clusters and 97 thus resolve the overall spatial distribution of channels . Also , to address the possibility that 98 Piezo1 cellular distribution could be altered by the cell - substrate interface , which we reasoned 99 may trap Piezo1 channels and deplete them from cell - attached patch - recordings on the cell 100 roof , we performed day - matched experiments of Neuro2A cells that had either been seeded to 101 adhere overnight or were acutely replated < 1 hour before recording , therefore allowing limited 102 time for channel redistribution ( see Methods ) . Importantly , we found that the mean channel 103 number and distributions in these two datasets were identical ( mean  S . E . M : overnight = 104 2 . 4  0 . 4 channels , n = 28 patches ; acute = 2 . 7  0 . 4 channels , n = 26 patches , p = 0 . 6 , Student’s t - 105 test ; Figure S2E ) , which argues against an effect of channel redistribution to the cell - substrate 106 interface . Finally , in order to obtain good representations of the spatial distribution and function 107 of Piezo1 channels , we executed this protocol on patches from a very large number of individual 108 Neuro2A cells ( n = 281 ) . 109 After background subtraction , we could easily recognize in most patches ( 248 / 281 ) discrete , 110 nearly instantaneous increases in current amplitude that are reflective of individual channel 111 openings , as well as clearly identify a plateau phase of the current ( Figure 1B , middle ) . The 112 remaining patches ( 33 / 281 ) were classified as having zero channels ( e . g . , Figure 1A ) . We next 113 used the mean single channel current from all patches with one channel ( i = 0 . 98  0 . 04 pA , n = 114 35 patches ; Figure S2F ) to calculate the precise number of channels ( n = I max / i ) in all other 115 patches . Ultimately , we obtained a continuous , bell - shaped distribution of Piezo1 channel 116 numbers per patch ( Figure 1E ) . The distribution average was 3 . 5  3 . 1 channels per patch , 117 which given our small pipette sizes is consistent with previously reported levels of expression in 118 Neuro2A cells ( Coste et al . 2010 ) . We also applied each protocol twice per patch and then 119 performed pairwise comparison of current amplitudes ( Figure S2G - H ) . This analysis revealed 120 an extremely low variability ( ratio of 2nd / 1st recording = 1 . 1  0 . 4 ; n = 261 ) , supporting that the 121 assessment of channel numbers is highly accurate . We then used an estimate of the dome size 122 of membrane patches inside patch - pipettes from imaging experiments we performed previously 123 in our lab ( ( Lewis and Grandl 2015 ) ; Figure S3 ; see Methods ) to calculate the average density 124 Piezo1 channels to be 1 - 2 channels / µm 2 . 125 Next , we used two different approaches to assess if density of Piezo1 channels affects their 126 sensitivity to membrane tension : First , we calculated P 50 values , measured from sigmoidal fits to 127 the ramp phase of the current , and plotted them as a function of channel number ( Figure 1F ) . 128 Although P 50 measurements varied widely in individual patches , especially for those with < 5 129 channels , because of the stochastic nature of channel gating ( e . g . , Figure 1C ) , this variance is 130 partially overcome by the large number of recordings we performed ( n = 248 ) . Importantly , while 131 there was some variability between two protocols executed on the same patch , there was only a 132 slight systematic shift in P 50 values toward smaller pressures in the second protocol , likely due 133 to creep and corresponding increase in patch radius ( mean  S . D . first = - 33 . 1  7 . 2 mmHg , 134 second = - 31 . 1  7 . 7 mmHg ;  P 50 = + 2 . 0  8 . 2 mmHg ; p < 0 . 05 , paired t - test ; Figure S2I ) , providing 135 further evidence that our protocol allowed for highly reproducible measurements . Altogether , the 136 results show that , for patches containing 1 - 15 channels , average P 50 values do not vary 137 substantially with channel number ( Figure 1F ) . 138 Still , to measure P 50 values in patches with few channels more precisely , we also performed a 139 different analysis : Specifically , we idealized recordings with ≦ 5 channels by identifying discrete 140 openings ( Figure 2A - E ; see Methods ) and then averaged all traces with equal channel 141 numbers in order to obtain their pressure - response curves ( Figure 2B ) . Visual inspection as 142 well as fits with sigmoidal functions show that P 50 and slope ( k ) values are virtually identical for 143 patches containing 1 - 5 channels ( 1 channel : P 50 = - 23 . 2 mmHg , k = - 3 . 3 mmHg ; 5 channels : P 50 144 = - 23 . 7 mmHg , k = - 4 . 2 mmHg ) . We therefore conclude from both analyses that at densities of 145 up to 2 channels / µm 2 , Piezo1 channels do not influence each other’s mechanosensitivity . 146 147 148 Spatial distribution of Piezo1 149 Multiple mechanisms may explain our above result that Piezo1 pressure sensitivity does not 150 vary with channel density . First , Piezo1 channels may be randomly distributed and therefore 151 spatially too distant to functionally interact via their membrane footprints . Alternatively , Piezo1 152 channels may indeed tend to localize in close spatial proximity ( i . e . , groups of 2 - 3 channels ) , but 153 this localization may have no effect on their pressure sensitivity . To begin distinguishing among 154 these possibilities , we built a statistical model for spatial localization , based on a Thomas point 155 process ( see Methods for details ) . First , we simulated a distribution of randomly dispersed 156 Piezo1 channels . Then we randomly sampled from this population , accounting for variability of 157 pipette sizes and single - channel currents by using our experimental mean values and standard 158 deviations of pipette size and single - channel conductance ( Figure S2D , F ) . The resulting 159 distribution fits the experimental data reasonably well , indicating that in Neuro2A cells , Piezo1 160 channels may be homogenously distributed across the cell surface , rather than being spatially 161 localized in close proximity ( Figure 3A - D ) . 162 In order to challenge this interpretation , we next simulated a random distribution of Piezo1 163 clusters in which individual Piezo channels are distributed across a 2D - Gaussian distribution 164 with a standard deviation of 50 nm which is our estimate for the Piezo channel footprint , all while 165 holding the overall channel density constant . Strikingly , a distribution in which on average 1 . 6 166 Piezo1 channels ( drawn from a Poisson distribution centered at 1 ; see Methods ) interact over 167 50 nm also describes the experimental data well . However , simulating larger channel clusters ( n 168 ~ 5 ) fails to reproduce the experimental distribution , specifically the probability of capturing 169 patches without any channels ( Figure 3A - E ) . Thus , our experimental data are most 170 parsimoniously explained by either a random spatial distribution or a weak propensity for Piezo 171 channels to spatially localize in groups of 2 - 3 . Interestingly , the two distributions differ 172 significantly in the predicted fraction of channels that are within one footprint of at least one 173 other channel : in a truly random distribution , the mean nearest neighbor distance is ~ 390 nm , 174 and only ~ 5 % of channels are within 100 nm of another channel , whereas if channels tend to 175 cluster in groups of 2 - 3 , the mean nearest neighbor distance is reduced to 225 nm and almost 176 50 % of channels are within 100 nm of another channel ( Figure 3F ) . However , our functional 177 data support the idea that if the latter spatial localization indeed occurs , it does not have a 178 substantial effect on Piezo1 pressure sensitivity ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . 179 180 181 Piezo1 function at high channel densities 182 Our above results do not answer if , in principle , Piezo1 channels have the ability to functionally 183 interact . We therefore decided next to examine Piezo1 function using a heterologous 184 overexpression system , in which channel densities are much higher . For these experiments , we 185 chose Neuro2A - Piezo1ko cells , in order to retain the same cellular background , but avoid 186 heterogeneity from endogenous and overexpressed Piezo1 , especially given that there are 187 known splice variants of Piezo1 ( Geng et al . 2020 ) . In pilot experiments , we found that 188 transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 maximizes channel density 42 - 48 hours post - transfection 189 ( data not shown ) . Since overexpression yields I max currents that are much larger , but also 190 causes a higher variability in the degree of inactivation even at positive potentials ( Figure S4A - 191 C ; current at 200 ms = 53 . 3  18 . 1 % of peak , n = 138 patches ) , this time we chose a classic 192 pressure - step protocol to best measure both peak current ( I max ) and pressure - sensitivity ( P 50 and 193 k ) . While the step protocol still produces a 2 - 3 pA background in peak amplitude , in the 194 overexpression system this error is very minor compared to the generally large currents , 195 especially for patches with many channels . To reduce bias from resting membrane tension , 196 each pressure step was preceded by a 5 second + 5 mmHg prepulse ( Lewis and Grandl 2015 ) , 197 and to minimize the effects of repetitive stimulation on membrane creep , we recorded at - 80 mV 198 and limited each step to 250 ms . We also used a pressure increment (  P ) of - 5 mmHg , so that 199 we could better resolve small changes in pressure sensitivity ( Figure 4A - B ) . As before , we 200 restricted our pipettes to 3 - 6 . 5 M  , a range in which peak current amplitudes do not vary 201 substantially ( Figure S6A ) . We again repeated this measurement for many individual patches ( n 202 = 133 patches ) in order to capture an accurate representation of channel densities and 203 functional interactions . 204 The low channel activity during the prepulse allowed us to measure the single - channel current 205 of each individual patch ( Figure S5 ) and therefore to precisely calculate the minimal number of 206 channels ( n = I max / i ) . This is particularly important in a cell - attached configuration , where even in 207 a high K + solution , there can be slight variance in the resting membrane potential and 208 correspondingly variance in the single - channel current in each cell that introduces an additional 209 source of error . Importantly , there was no correlation between number of channels and single - 210 channel current , suggesting that unitary conductance of Piezo1 is not modulated by channel 211 density ( Figure S5C ) . The number of channels per patch was well - described by a Gaussian 212 distribution with 35 . 3  15 . 9 channels per patch ( Figure 4C ) , which we estimate corresponds to a 213 Piezo1 density of 10 - 20 channels / µm 2 ( see Methods ) . The most extreme current amplitude we 214 observed ( - 160 pA , or ~ 80 channels ) corresponds to a maximal density of ~ 40 channels / µm 2 . At 215 this maximal density , if Piezo channels were randomly distributed in the membrane , their mean 216 next - neighbor distance would be ~ 80 nm , and 31 % of the membrane surface would be covered 217 by Piezo proteins and their corresponding membrane footprints ( Figure S7 ) . This calculation 218 suggests that we have reached densities in which Piezos are likely in close enough proximity to 219 influence each other’s function . Moreover , this calculation likely represents a slight 220 underestimate of the true channel density , owing to inactivation at negative potentials . 221 Two groups had previously predicted that nearby Piezo1 channels may influence each other’s 222 gating , even in the absence of membrane tension ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon 2018 , Jiang et 223 al . 2021 ) . We therefore chose first to analyze the activity during the prepulse , which is designed 224 to minimize resting membrane tension . We found that open probability was generally small 225 ( ~ 1 % ) , which was consistent with previous work in our lab ( Wu , Goyal , and Grandl 2016 ) . Most 226 notably however , we found that Piezo1 open probability did not increase with channel density ; 227 rather , open probability slightly decreased , from 0 . 86  1 . 00 % for patches with 1 - 10 channels 228 ( mean  S . D . ; n = 6 patches ) to 0 . 40  0 . 09 % for patches with 60 - 70 channels ( n = 5 patches ) 229 ( Figure 4D ) . There was no change in open probability with pipette resistance , indicating that 230 variability in the ability of the prepulse to minimize resting tension with pipette size does not 231 account for this trend in open probability with channel number ( Figure S6B ) . 232 As an alternative test , we measured the effect of channel number on pressure sensitivity ( P 50 and 233 slope ( k ) ) . The results show that for patches containing > 20 channels , neither slope nor P 50 values 234 are affected by channel number ( Figure 4E ) . The average P 50 value for < 20 channels appears 235 slightly right - shifted , but is also relatively imprecise , because the stochastic nature of channel 236 gating makes pressure - response curves noisy and hard to capture with sigmoid fits , and efficient 237 averaging is precluded by the few patches with low channel numbers . Therefore , we also 238 analyzed the data in a separate way : We normalized each patch to its maximal current , binned 239 patches according to their number of channels , and then averaged pressure - response curves 240 ( Figure 4F ) . The results show at most a slight left - shift in pressure - response curves and increase 241 in sensitivity ( slope ) with increasing channel number ( for 20 - 30 channels , P 50 = - 24 . 1 mmHg , k = 242 - 9 . 9 mmHg , n = 27 ; for 60 - 70 channels , P 50 = - 17 . 1 mmHg , k = - 6 . 7 mmHg , n = 10 ) . Altogether , 243 we conclude that at high densities , Piezo1 channels may be slightly more sensitive to pressure , 244 but that there is no positive cooperativity in the nominal absence of membrane tension . 245 246 Discussion 247 We sought to characterize the inherent ability of Piezo channels to spatially localize and 248 modulate each other’s function . We chose cell - attached patch - clamp electrophysiology as a 249 method for investigation , which has several inherent limitations that need to be considered . 250 First , our spatial resolution is naturally limited by the size of the patch pipette . Consequently , our 251 statistical approach of counting channels within membrane patches works best when the spatial 252 distance between Piezo1 channels is comparable to the size of the membrane dome inside the 253 patch pipette . The fact that ~ 15 % of patches in wild - type Neuro2A cells contained no Piezo1 254 channels ( Figure 1E ) is therefore an extremely important quality benchmark for adequate 255 spatial resolution . Our modeling does not allow us to rule out the possibility of moderate 256 clustering ( 2 - 3 Piezo1 channels ) , but we find no evidence for clusters of larger sizes ( ~ 5 257 channels ) , which we would have been able to detect . 258 Next , our measurement of endogenous Piezo1 density in Neuro2A cells ( 1 . 75 channels / µm 2 ) 259 has several sources of error : First , while we have modest control over the pipette shape during 260 its fabrication and a precise measure of its resistance , the exact surface of each membrane 261 dome is not known . We returned to previous experiments , where we optically determined the 262 geometry of membrane domes inside patch pipettes , to estimate patch dome area , but the 263 drastically limited throughput of that technique precluded individually measuring each pipette 264 ( Lewis and Grandl 2015 ) . In order to minimize this size variability , we therefore limited our 265 analysis to measurements from a narrow range of pipette resistances and incorporated this size 266 variability of patch pipettes into our statistical model of Piezo1 spatial distribution ( Figure S2D ) . 267 Certainly , when overexpressing Piezo1 , the variability in Piezo1 membrane levels is high , in part 268 due to variable expression level among cells . It is also subject to additional error due to the 269 presence of inactivation , which prevents observation of P o = 1 . However , none of the above 270 statistical errors , or others we did not consider and that skew channel number distributions , 271 affect our ability to correlate Piezo1 channel number with its function . 272 The weaknesses of cell - attached patch - clamp electrophysiology are balanced by two clear 273 strengths : the method has relatively high throughput so that large numbers of independent 274 measurements yield good population averages , and it has unmatched precision : channel 275 number and function , including single - channel current , open probability and pressure - sensitivity 276 can be extracted over nearly two orders of magnitude ( 1 - 80 channels ) with high accuracy . For 277 example , repeated execution of pressure ramps on each patch revealed that channel number 278 ( n ) is measured with only 24 % variability , demonstrating that this assessment is extremely 279 accurate . 280 Neither endogenous Piezo1 in Neuro2A cells or overexpression of Piezo1 in Neuro2A - P1ko 281 cells are perfect model systems for investigating how Piezo1 channels function when they are 282 directly contacting each other : experimental channel densities do not reach the theoretical limit 283 of a tightly packed 2D hexagonal lattice . However , the maximal densities we obtained are 284 certainly sufficient for Piezo1 membrane footprints to geometrically overlap : for example , at the 285 highest density we measured ( ~ 80 channels / µm 2 ) , the centers of randomly spaced Piezo1 286 domes are on average 80 nm from their nearest neighbor , which results in a substantial number 287 of channels having overlapping membrane footprints ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon 2018 ) . 288 Additionally , in the overexpression experiments our step protocol may slightly underestimate 289 channel numbers , as inactivation at negative potentials likely precludes piezo1 from reaching 290 maximal open probability . In any case , two distinct analyses show that at densities of 1 - 2 291 channels / µm 2 ( Figure 1 - 2 ) and 10 - 20 channels / µm 2 ( Figure 4 ) Piezo1 pressure sensitivity is not 292 modulated by channel numbers . A mechanistic explanation for this result at low densities is 293 directly provided by our data and statistical model of spatial distributions , which suggest that in 294 Neuro2A cells , Piezo1 channels are either randomly distributed or have at best a very low 295 probability of aggregating . This is consistent with Haselwandter and MacKinnon’s prediction that 296 the Piezo structure favors channels to repel each other . However , the result does not mean that 297 Piezo1 channels in close proximity can never be found . A mild tendency for clustering predicts 298 20 % of all Piezo1 channels to be within 50 nm of each other ( cluster size = 1 . 6 ; Figure 3F ) , 299 which is fully consistent with studies that have captured images of neighboring Piezo1 channels 300 ( Ridone et al . 2020 ) , but 80 % of all Piezo1 channels are outside this range . In other words , in 301 wild - type Neuro2A cells , most Piezo1 channels are too far apart to ‘feel’ each other . As a 302 consequence , they behave as functionally independent mechanotransducers . This result is 303 important , because it shows that Piezo1 channels have no strong intrinsic tendency to spatially 304 concentrate and functionally modulate each other’s mechanical sensitivity . Both of these 305 properties are ideal for a cell in order to transduce mechanical forces homogeneously . 306 Still , does the Piezo1 membrane footprint allow for the possibility of cooperativity among nearby 307 channels ? Our experiments at high channel densities ( 10 - 20 channels / µm 2 ) reveal at most a 308 modest sensitization of Piezo1 pressure sensitivity with increasing channel numbers . While this 309 result supports the idea of an interaction via the membrane footprint other mechanisms may 310 well be responsible and must be considered : for example , calcium permeating through Piezo1 311 may activate or sensitize nearby channels . Indeed , calcium - induced cooperativity is a well - 312 known phenomenon in other ion channels , such as TRPA1 ( Wang et al . 2008 ) . Our experiments 313 cannot directly rule out this explanation . 314 Surprisingly , our data suggest that in the nominal absence of membrane tension Piezo1 open 315 probability is slightly reduced with channel number and overall , very low ( < 1 % ) at all channel 316 densities we probed . This is notable , because the opposite result was recently obtained by 317 simulations of Piezo1 that are in extreme proximity to each other ( 1 - 3 nm dome - dome distance ; 318 ( Jiang et al . 2021 ) ) . The reasons for this discrepancy may be technical limitations in the 319 modeling , which was performed with a partial Piezo1 structure , or our own experiments , which 320 cannot generate the extreme channel densities probed in the simulation . 321 Altogether , our conclusions may be applicable to other cell types that express Piezos at levels 322 similar or lower to that of Neuro2A . However , we fully expect that specific cell types may 323 concentrate Piezo channels into locations that are dedicated to detecting forces . For example , it 324 is plausible that in sensory neurons Piezo2 channels may be highly concentrated in free nerve 325 endings as compared to the cell soma . However , our work directly predicts that if such a 326 clustering was indeed observed , it would require a dedicated mechanism that is not Piezo - 327 intrinsic , such as a still elusive tethering molecule . 328 329 330 331 Acknowledgements 332 This study was supported by NIH 5R01NS110552 ( A .

Human umbilical vein 349 endothelial cells ( HUVECs ; Lonza CC - 2519 , pooled ) were cultured in EGM - 1 . For experiments 350 without transfection , cells were directly plated on poly - L - lysine and laminin - coated coverslips 16 - 351 24 hours before recording . For overexpression experiments , cells were transiently transfected 352 with 4 µg mouse Piezo1 - pIRES - EGFP in pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) or 4 µg YFP 40 - 48 hours before 353 recording in 6 - well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the 354 manufacturer’s protocol . Transfected cells were reseeded onto poly - L - lysine and laminin - coated 355 coverslips 16 - 24 hours before recording . Only one patch was made from each cell ; in some 356 cases , two protocols were run on each patch ( as noted ) . For acute plating experiments , cells 357 were reseeded onto poly - L - lysine and laminin - coated coverslips , allowed to settle for 45 358 minutes , and then recorded for up to one additional hour . 359 360 Electrophysiology 361 Electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature using an EPC10 amplifier 362 and Patchmaster software ( HEKA Elektronik , Lambrecht , Germany ) . Data were sampled at 5 363 kHz ( wild - type Neuro2A ) or 10 kHz ( Neuro2a - p1ko + mPiezo1 ) and filtered at 2 . 9 kHz . The cell - 364 attached bath solution used to zero the membrane potential was ( in mM ) : 140 KCl , 10 HEPES , 365 1 MgCl 2 , 10 glucose , pH 7 . 3 with KOH . Borosilicate glass pipettes ( 1 . 5 OD , 0 . 85 ID , Sutter 366 Instrument Company , Novato , CA ) were filled with pipette buffer solution ( in mM : 130 NaCl , 5 367 KCl , 10 HEPES , 10 TEACl , 1 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 3 with NaOH . In a small dataset obtained 368 with pipettes with a resistance of less than 3 M  peak current was strongly correlated with 369 pipette size and few patches had zero channels ( Figure S2D ) ; we therefore restricted our final 370 dataset to pipettes between 3 - 6 . 5 M  Negative pressure was applied through the patch pipette 371 with an amplifier - controlled high - speed pressure clamp system ( HSPC - 1 ; ALA Scientific 372 Instruments , Farmingdale , NY ) . All pressure protocols were preceded by a + 5 mmHg prepulse 373 ( + 60 mV recordings , 2 seconds ; - 80 mV recordings , 5 seconds ) to remove resting tension due 374 to the gigaseal ( Lewis and Grandl 2015 ) . 375 376 Quantification and Statistical Analysis 377 All data were analyzed and final plots were generated using Igor Pro 8 . 02 ( Wavemetrics ) . 378 For currents measured during ramp protocols , current was binned for each pressure ( 1 mmHg 379 increments ) and any linear changes in leak prior to the first channel opening were manually 380 identified and subtracted off prior to further analysis . Current - pressure curves were fit with a 381 Boltzmann function 382 I = I min + I max 1 + e ( P50−Pk ) 383 where I max is the maximal current , P is pressure , P 50 is pressure of half - maximal activation , and 384 k is the slope factor . The number of channels in each patch was calculated by dividing I max by 385 the mean single channel current from all patches with precisely one channel ( i . e . , I max during the 386 ramp phase for patches with only one visually identified discrete opening , Figure 1 ) or from 387 single channel openings during the prepulse ( step recordings with overexpressed channels , 388 Figure 4 ) . To generate idealized currents ( Figure 2 ) , the number of channels ( n ) in each patch , 389 as well as the time of openings , were manually identified . Patches with larger numbers of 390 channels ( 3 - 5 ) are underrepresented due to the increased difficulty in identifying discrete 391 openings . For currents measured during step protocols , to reduce artifacts from noise , the peak 392 was measured from a 0 . 5 ms rolling average around the true peak and the steady - state current 393 was calculated as the mean current during the last 10 ms of the step . 394 Single - channel currents during the + 5 mmHg prepulse were filtered offline ( 1 kHz ) using 395 Fitmaster v2x90 . 2 and baseline - subtracted using QuB online software ( Nicolai and Sachs 396 2013 ) . Single channel amplitudes during the prepulse were measured by generating all - points 397 histograms with binning calculated using the Freedman - Diaconis method and an optimal bin 398 width of 2 * IQR ( x ) / N 1 / 3 , where IQR is the interquartile distance , N is the number of observations , 399 and the bins are evenly distributed between the minimum and maximum values . Binned data 400 were then fit with a double - Gaussian equation of the form 401 𝑦 = 𝑦 0 + 𝐴 1 ∗ 𝑒 − ( 𝑥−𝑥 1 𝑤 1 ) 2 + 𝐴 2 ∗ 𝑒 − ( 𝑥−𝑥 2 𝑤 2 ) 2 402 where y 0 is the baseline current , A 1 and A 2 are the peak amplitudes , x 1 and x 2 are the centers of 403 the fits , and w 1 and w 2 their respective widths . The difference between x 1 and x 2 reflects the 404 difference between mean current in the open and closed state and was used to calculate single 405 channel current i . 406 Open probability during the prepulse was calculated as the mean current ( i * n * P o ) divided by the 407 maximum current elicited for that patch at saturating pressures , assumed to be P o = 1 ( i * n ) . 408 Data are reported as mean  SD unless otherwise indicated . For box and whisker plots , boxes 409 represent median and first and third quartiles . 410 411 Thomas Clustering Model 412 A model for spatial distribution of Piezo1 ion channels was built using a Thomas point process 413 in IGOR Pro 8 . 02 ( Wavemetrics ) ( Baddeley 2015 ) . Parent discs were randomly distributed in a 414 50 µm x 50 µm arena . Each parent disc was then randomly assigned a varying number of 415 daughter points . For a truly random distribution ( mean cluster = 1 ) every parent disc was 416 assigned precisely 1 daughter point . To introduce a slight propensity for channels to cluster , the 417 number of daughter points were drawn from a Poisson distribution centered at 1 , such that the 418 mean cluster size ( for populated clusters ) was 1 . 6 . To introduce a stronger propensity to cluster , 419 the number of daughter points were drawn from a Poisson distribution centered around 5 ( mean 420 cluster = 5 ) ; Figure 3A . The densities of parent discs and daughter points were adjusted such 421 that their product , and thus the final number of daughter points in the arena , was equivalent to 422 that of the wild - type Neuro2A dataset ( 1 . 75 channels / µm 2 ) . Daughter points were then 423 distributed in each parental disc according to a Gaussian distribution with an average distance 424 of sigma = 50 nm from the center of the disc , or roughly the distance of three Piezo footprint 425 decay lengths . The arena was then sampled with 1 , 000 circles whose centers were uniformly 426 distributed within the arena . To replicate variability in pipette size / patch dome size as source of 427 noise , the mean radius of all circles was 0 . 8 µm ( see below ) with a standard deviation of 0 . 15 428  m , which corresponds to our mean pipette size of 4 . 35 M  and standard deviation of 0 . 8 M  429 ( Figure S3 ) . Finally , the number of daughter points ( “channel counts” ) within each circle was 430 then counted . To further account for variability in transmembrane potentials as a source of 431 noise , we translated channel counts into current amplitudes using our experimentally obtained 432 normal distribution of single channel currents , which yielded a mean single channel current of 433 0 . 98 pA and standard deviation of 0 . 22 pA ( Figure S2F ) . Current amplitudes were then reverted 434 into channel counts and used to generate a channel count histogram . Nearest neighbor 435 distributions were obtained from the same simulated distributions as above , by calculating a 436 distance matrix between all channel centers and taking the minimal distance for each row . 437 438 Calculation of channel footprint and density 439 The characteristic decay length (  ) of membrane deformation induced by the large curved dome 440 of Piezo1 is estimated to be 14 nm ( Haselwandter and Mackinnon , 2018 ) . We put an upper 441 bounds of possible Piezo energetic interactions due to membrane curvature beyond the dome 442 itself as 3x this decay length ; when adding this to the radius of the channel dome , this yields an 443 approximate total membrane footprint of ( 10 nm + 3 * 14 nm ~ 50 nm ) . 444 From our previous data ( ( Lewis and Grandl 2015 ) ; Figure S3 ) we estimated that patch domes 445 from pipettes 3 - 6 M  have an approximate surface area of 2 µm 2 . If the patch dome is 446 approximated as a flat circle , this corresponds to a pipette radius of 0 . 8 µm , which was used for 447 simulation of Piezo1 spatial distribution in the Thomas point process model . For native 448 expression in Neuro2A cells , our average channel count was 3 . 5 channels , which corresponds 449 to an average density of 1 . 75 channels / µm 2 . For overexpression of Piezo1 in Neuro2A - p1ko 450 cells , our average channel count was 35 channels , which corresponds to an average density of 451 17 channels / µm 2 . For the maximal current amplitude we observed ( 160 pA = ~ 80 channels ) , 452 with an estimated in - plane area of 400 nm 2 ( Wang et al . 2019 ) , an estimated footprint of 7 , 800 453 nm 2 ( calculated from a footprint of 50 nm ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon 2018 ) ) and a patch 454 dome surface area of 2 µm 2  approximately 2 % of the membrane surface would be covered by 455 Piezo channels and 31 % of the surface covered by Piezos + corresponding footprints . 456 Figure 1 : Low levels of Piezo1 expression in Neuro2A cells do not influence pressure sensitivity .

Middle , Current - pressure relationship for the same patch . Mean current was calculated for each step , in 1 mmHg increments , and plotted as a function of pressure . Note the linear relationship between current and pressure during the step , despite no channel activity in this patch ( inferred from the lack of discrete channel opening events ) . This is likely due to small changes in seal quality and / or capacitance . The linear portion of the current - pressure relationship was fitted with a line ( red dashes ) .
