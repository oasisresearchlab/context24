By taking advantage of the methodology developed by Strumsky et al , we represent the different degrees of novelty of the inventive activity , and the evolution on their complexity . Results show that , Lead - Acid Batteries have become a complementary technology , for the design of all Alternative Energy Vehicles , rather than a rival technology . Keywords— recombination , complexity , technological classes , lead - acid batteries , alternative electric vehicles I . I NTRODUCTION Throughout XX century , lead - acid batteries ( LAB ) became the dominant design in automotive industry due to their low cost , safety , and level of performance [ 1 - 3 ] . However , with the emergence of alternative energy vehicles ( AEVs ) , LAB faces new requirements in terms of functionality , life cycle , design , development and production cost [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . From economics of innovation [ 5 , 6 ] and theory of Complex Adaptive Systems [ 7 - 10 ] the present research has as its central objective study the technological evolution of LAB , based on their inventive activity , for the period 1981 - 2013 . We address the following research questions : 1 ) What is the participation of LAB in the inventive activity of the total number of batteries designed for AEVs ? ; 2 ) Within the technological progress of AEV , has the technological complexity of LAB increased ? ; 3 ) What are the main types of novelty that characterize the technological evolution of the LAB ? and 4 ) In terms of exploration / exploitation activities , is there a foreseeable concentration of exploitation in a mature technology such as the LAB ? The discussion is organized as follows . The next section explains the relationship between complexity , recombination , and technology exploration and exploitation activities from the perspective of Complex Adaptive Systems . Section 3 describes the use of patent classes to quantify technological complexity and identify the various types of inventive novelty - based on the taxonomy of Strumsky et al [ 11 , 12 ] . Section 4 , using the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) patents , for the period 1981 - 2013 , presents the proportion of LAB with respect to advanced batteries for AEVs . In same section , presents the main findings about the changes in the complexity of LAB and some explanations of them , also the proportions of the different types of inventive novelty and of exploration / exploitation activities , that together account for the persistence of the technological activity in LAB , and some reasons that explain the identified patterns are described . Section 5 concludes . II . R ECOMBINATION AND T ECHNOLOGICAL C OMPLEXITY The emergence of new technologies has been analyzed from different perspectives . It is possible to distinguish , in principle , the following three approaches : 1 ) Gradualism : Technologies emerge and evolve through the variation of previous technologies and the selection of the most suitable ones . The accumulation of gradual variations and continuous improvements , resulting from deliberate modifications or unplanned discoveries , varies the set of elements and / or physical structures that make up a particular technology [ 13 - 17 ] . Technological complexity comes from the growing differentiation , specialization , and integration of its physical parts [ 18 ] . In this perspective , the analysis of patents is only presented as examples [ 19 - 21 ] . 2 ) Combination / Accumulation : Technologies emerge and evolve as new combinations of existing ones . These represent a cumulative synthesis [ 22 ] that is available , as building blocks , for the development of others [ 23 - 28 ] . Technologies are combinations of “mechanical” elements that accumulate as part of the social heritage [ 29 ] . This approach does not explain the emergence of unprecedented technologies ; likewise , it lacks a unit to quantify the inventive activity and , in terms of the measurement of complexity , it is not possible to precisely identify the original block from which the cumulative synthesis begins to be generated . 3 ) Recombination of natural phenomena : Origination of new technologies is a process that , to fulfill a purpose , links a phenomenon with a need [ 8 ] . Thus , a new principle is generated . However , the principles can rarely be used crudely ; to use them it is necessary to program a family of phenomena and encapsulate them in physical devices to create a physical architecture . This architecture has a modular , hierarchical , and nested structure ; that is , it is made up of components or modules linked to central and complementary functions ; where , a group of components 2023 I EEE I n t e r n a ti on a l A u t u m n M ee ti ng on P o w e r , E l ec t r on i c s a nd C o m pu ti ng ( R O P E C ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 3688 - 7 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EEE | DO I : 10 . 1109 / R O P E C 58757 . 2023 . 10409480 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

Ixtapa , Mexico exploit a family of phenomena associated with the central function ; while others use phenomena and principles to perform complementary functions ( protect and regulate devices , supply power , or perform other tasks ) . Any component or module is a technological subsystem composed , in turn , of other subsystems [ 7 , 8 ] . The technological components are interconnected , interact , and communicate with each other ( the output of one is the input of the others ) and work in a coordinated manner to achieve a common purpose , each of them performing a necessary task . This chain of interactions and interconnections ends up affecting the entire architecture [ 9 ] , in the sense that changes at one level imply changes at the others , to reconfigure and thus adapt the central and complementary purposes . From this perspective , the recombination of natural phenomena is a process that links a purpose with a principle and encapsulates them in an architecture that , through multiple components , performs functions . In this way , a technology is complex to the extent that it combines a greater diversity of components , which orchestrate different phenomena , to fulfill one or more functions . The complexity of technological systems thus depends on both the number of components and the resulting interactions . Complex Adaptive Systems theory has contributed to represent in a new way the underlying complexity in the nature and evolution of technology . Also , it has taken advantage of patent information to quantitatively describe inventive activity and technological complexity [ 11 , 12 , 30 , 31 ] . Novelty methodology Strumsky et al [ 11 ] makes it possible to distinguish different types of technological recombination and identify exploitation and exploration activities . III . C LASSES , C OMPLEXITY AND T YPES OF N OVELTY In the United States , patented technologies are identified through a class number system , the United States Patent Classification ( USPC ) system is based on a scheme created in the early 20th century and is legally mandated to provide a Comprehensive reference to all patentable subjects . This classification is reviewed periodically . USPC technology classes are made up of a pair of codes known as main class and subclass . Classes indicate specific features of knowledge and are combined by patent examiners to generate a complete description . Classes indicate capabilities , boundaries , and complexities of a technology and empirically establish the degree of novelty of a technology [ 30 ] . Classes can be used to measure the complexity of inventions . The degree of complexity can be understood as the minimum necessary length of a sequence of symbols or words that describe a process or result [ 9 , 32 , 33 , ] . Thus , an invention will be simple if the number of classes that describe its operation or process is small . And it will be complex insofar as it requires a large number of classes to describe its process or properties . On the other hand , Strumsky et al [ 11 , 12 ] have developed a taxonomy , based on the technological classes and their resulting binary combinations to characterize the technological novelty of a patent in four categories : ( 1 ) Origination : All the classes in the patent are new and , therefore , their resulting binary combinations are also new , ( 2 ) Novel combination : The patent contains at least one new technological class and , consequently , there are new binary combinations with that class , ( 3 ) Recombination : The patent contains new binary combinations generated with classes previously used in other Patents , and , ( 4 ) Reuse : All classes of the patent and their binary combinations have been previously used in other patents . IV . I NVENTIVE A CTIVITY OF B ATTERIES FOR AEV S Automotive companies have explored various materials – nickel - cadmium ( NC ) , nickel - metal hydride ( NMH ) , and lithium - ion ( LI ) – as alternatives to LAB . One way to capture the inventive efforts toward the transition to new and more sophisticated energy storage systems demanded by AEVs is to observe the evolution in the number of patents for each type of battery . Fig . 1 shows a general increase in inventive activity in batteries for AEVs . If it is analyzed in three periods of the same magnitude , it can be seen that from 1981 to 1991 , an average of 18 patents per year are registered , in total 203 , of which 98 . 5 % ( 200 ) are from LAB . From 1992 to 2002 , the average is 100 patents , with a total of 1108 , the percentage of LAB is reduced to 39 . 5 % , meanwhile , LI , NMH and NC patents represent 29 . 6 % , 25 % and 5 . 8 % respectively . And from 2003 to 2013 , the annual average of patents is 211 , reaching a total of 2327 where 66 . 8 % are LI , 14 . 4 % NHM , 11 . 3 % LAB and 7 . 3 % NC . Fig . 1 . Number of patents for advanced batteries for AEVs , by type of active material A . Evolution of technological complexity of LAB for AEVs A first way to identify the complexity of patents is by looking at the percentage frequency distribution of their number of classes . Fig . 2 shows this distribution for LAB . It stands out that of the 902 patents that make up the total , 16 intervals ( classes ) are formed . This number is in itself significant since , following Page [ 34 ] , in the combinatorial process , diversity and complexity are concomitant phenomena : “without diversity it is not possible to observe much complexity ; but without complexity , diversity becomes mere variation on the mean” . Likewise , it is observed that only a small fraction ( 5 . 6 % ) of the patents ( 50 ) have 1 technological class , while 64 . 7 % have 2 - 4 classes . It is now convenient to observe the evolution of the number of classes per period . Figure 3 depics annual average of classes has a slightly increasing tendency . During 1981 - 2013 , the average is 3 . 86 classes . However , the average hides significant differences .

Ixtapa , Mexico the number of classes changes during the period . From the point of view of their relative weight , the patents with the greatest growth are those with 5 or more classes . During 1981 - 1991 these represent 22 . 5 % ( 45 patents ) , while between 2003 - 2013 reached 33 % ( 87 patents ) . Fig . 2 . LAB patent distribution for AEVs , by number of classes ( 1981 - 2013 ) Fig . 3 . Annual Average LAB Patent Classes for VEAs ( 1981 - 2013 ) Table I reveals that as the inventive activity progresses , patents combine an increasingly greater number of classes , mostly 4 or more classes in the last period . Patents with 4 classes or more , in the last period , contribute 53 % of the inventive activity , while the first and second periods represent 46 % and 43 . 7 % , respectively . T ABLE I . N UMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF LAB PATENTS FOR AEV S , BY NUMBER OF CLASSES AND PERIODS Classes Periods 1981 - 1991 1992 - 2002 2003 - 2013 1981 - 2013 ( Total ) 1 10 ( 5 . 0 % ) 19 ( 4 . 3 % ) 21 ( 8 . 0 % ) 50 ( 5 . 5 % ) 2 38 ( 19 . 0 % ) 96 ( 21 . 9 % ) 47 ( 17 . 8 % ) 181 ( 20 . 1 % ) 3 60 ( 30 . 0 % ) 131 ( 29 . 9 % ) 56 ( 21 . 2 % ) 247 ( 27 . 4 % ) 4 47 ( 23 . 5 % ) 81 ( 18 . 4 % ) 53 ( 20 . 1 % ) 181 ( 20 . 1 % ) 5 or more 45 ( 22 . 5 % ) 111 ( 25 . 3 % ) 87 ( 32 . 9 % ) 243 ( 26 . 9 % ) LAB ( Total ) 200 ( 22 . 1 % ) 438 ( 48 . 6 % ) 264 ( 29 . 3 % ) 902 ( 100 % ) Why LAB are increasingly complex systems ? From the point of view of the nature of technology [ 8 ] the following factors are identified : ( 1 ) the discovery of an increasingly diverse and profound set of scientific phenomena and principles applied to LAB ( nanotechnology ) [ 35 ] , ( 2 ) the convergence and interaction of previously separate technological domains ( mechatronics , electrochemistry , physical - biology , and nanotechnology [ 36 ] , ( 3 ) more complex designs of the internal components and / or modules ( the electrical / electronic ( E / E ) modules to manage and monitor battery health and energy [ 37 ] , and , ( 4 ) the requirements of different market niches that demand increasingly differentiated performance and functions ( greater capacity and charging speed , high cycle longevity , etc . [ 4 ] . Three relevant trajectories emerge . For one thing , all AEVs require an advanced auxiliary battery to power the low - voltage E / E systems . In the case of hybrid vehicles for the ignition , lighting and ignition of the combustion engine ; for electric vehicles , to power the infotainment system in particular . Advanced LAB are safe , stable , cheap , and sufficient to power these systems [ 38 ] . In accordance with the requirements of AEVs , these advanced auxiliary batteries are more complex than the relatively simple conventional LA technology : the power , lighting and ignition ( SLI ) battery . In addition to powering the E / E systems , they are used as reserve power for traction , provide power to certain critical functions in the vehicle , and power new cooling systems . These batteries have developed new and more complex technologies : Valve Regulated Lead Acid ( VRLA ) ; Enhanced Flooded Batteries ( EFB ) or the Gel Battery ( GB ) and Absorption Glass Mat ( AGM ) , these last two derivatives of the VRLA itself [ 39 ] . Thus , a dual battery system is implemented , where the LAB are a complementary system to the traction batteries [ 40 , 41 ] . Second trajectory explains the increase in the complexity of LAB is their application as traction batteries in single and two - seater microvehicles weighing less than 1 , 000k ( electric bicycles , scooters , electric wheelchairs , light forklifts , golf , passenger and / or cargo transport at airports , etc . systems [ 38 ] . Various technologies have been developed for these : VRLA ; GB ; EFB ; AGM ; and advanced lead carbon ( ALC ) . Third trajectory , associated with the increasingly complex interactions between batteries and the new systems of vehicles with internal combustion engine - alternators with Start - Stop ( ICE + ) , microhybrid ( MHVs ) and mild hybrids ( MHEVs ) systems [ 40 ] . These vehicles have a high energy variation , and , in these conditions , the advanced LAB are more complex and provide an optimal technological solution for the Start - Stop or energy absorption functions for the regenerative brakes typical of these vehicles . The batteries used in these AEVs are ALC technology because they are less expensive , safer , less heavy / bulky and more sustainable [ 37 , 38 ] . Design and development of LAB shows an increase in their complexity , in the sense that , in order to fulfill their new central or complementary functions : 1 ) inside the batteries , there are more components ( in theoretical terms N increases ) that interact with each other in novel ways ( again , in theoretical terms , interdependence increases , k ) [ 42 , 43 ] ; and 2 ) these components interact with more and new external elements that make up the new architectures of the AEVs . B . Persistence of innovation , nolvety and E / E activities Having analyzed the increasing complexity of LAB , it is pertinent to determine if this is the result of a simple process of recombining existing knowledge and skills or if it is an original and novel development . In this way , it is possible to understand why technological innovation has been maintained in an apparently mature and replaceable good such as the LA battery . 1 ) Types of inventive novelty in LAB Based on the novelty taxonomy [ 11 , 12 ] , the evolution of the types of inventive novelty of LAB is described ( Fig . 4 ) . Two opposing and significant trends are identified . The Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . 2023 IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power , Electronics and Computing ( ROPEC 2023 ) : Electric Vehicles International Symposium . Ixtapa , Mexico proportion of origination patents is decreasing , going from 60 . 5 % in the first period ( 1981 - 1991 ) to 32 . 2 % in the last period ( 2003 - 2013 ) . This seems to be normal in a mature technology since at the beginning a greater number of origination patents is expected ( the technology is new ) and over time a greater frequency of reuse patents is expected ( new developments take advantage of the knowledge and skills acquired previously ) . Fig . 4 . Percentage of LAB patents , by type of inventive novelty ( 1981 - 2013 ) However , it stands out that origination remains the main source of novelty in the three periods ( 1981 - 1991 , 1992 - 2002 , 2003 - 2013 ) despite the expected displacement of the LA battery from VEAs by other types of batteries . For their part , recombination and reuse patents gain importance , going from 24 % in the first period to 52 . 6 % in the last period . According to these patterns , it can be affirmed that inventive activity is being reconfigured , promoting less innovative forms of invention and greater use of pre - existing building blocks . Together , these results can be considered as an expression of the evolution process from conventional LAB ( SLI ) to advanced LAB . In which the novelty emerges throughout the period , through different types . Where origination is important because it allows opening new opportunity niches that transcend to better and new combinations and , in turn , to more complex combinations . 2 ) Exploration / Exploitation in LAB Indicators of types of novelty makes it possible to identify the exploration or exploitation activities [ 44 ] underlying the technological evolution of LAB . Exploration activities can be identified with origination and recombination patents , while exploitation activities can correspond to recombination and reuse patents . It is observed that during the analysis period there is a balance between exploration / exploitation activities – Fig . 4 Textured areas ( scan ) versus solid color areas ( scan ) . Contrary to what would be expected , the technological evolution characterized by the predominance of exploitation over exploration over time , LAB have adapted to the technological progress of AEVs through a balance of both activities . Such levels of exploration draw attention to an apparently mature technology [ 38 ] and considered , in principle , incapable of meeting the various requirements of AEVs [ 41 ] . 3 ) Persistence in innovation of LAB Once the permanence of the exploration activities in the LAB in the last 3 decades has been determined , it is necessary to describe the qualitative characteristics of their technological evolution and for this , the main facts for each period will be analyzed . During the period 1981 - 1991 , little inventive activity , high levels of exploration and relatively low complexity are observed . It is explained because in the face of the emergence of new generation electric vehicles , the strategy of the automotive industry was to incorporate electric motors in the vehicles and provide them with energy through LAB with SLI technology . The inventive activity of LAB during this period is associated with the effort to solve the functional deficiencies of these batteries ( weight , load capacity , life cycles , voltage , power and volume ) . The physical limits of SLI batteries are being sought , with little success [ 4 , 45 ] . With the change in vehicle design ( from ICEs to EVs ) , battery goes from being a simple , mature and standardized component , to a complex component , increasingly integrated . Thus , between 1992 - 2002 , the industry branches out its strategies in the following areas . On the battery side : a ) the development of new traction batteries with different materials ( LI , NHM or NC ) is being explored , and b ) the aim is to improve LAB through the development of VRLA technology . On the vehicle side , changes are proposed in its structure : a ) in EVs , an external battery recharging system is added and the regenerative braking system is improved , to extend the autonomy and speed ranges of the vehicle and , b ) hybrid vehicles are developed , which allow reducing the wasted energy associated with the internal combustion engine and mechanical processes compared to electronic systems [ 46 ] . In this way , a tree structure of the architectures in hybrid vehicles ( in series , in parallel , in series - parallel ) was generated . These processes affect LAB , promoting greater inventive activity , an increase in their complexity and a balance between exploration and exploitation , all compared to what was recorded in the previous period . Despite the arduous efforts to improve the performance of LAB , it is identified that VRLA technology ( both GB and AGM ) is not suitable for use in any of the vehicles that are explored in this period ( EVs and HEVs ) . It is stated that compared to SLI technology , the AGM concept provides a much longer service life and more constant dynamic load acceptance ; Meanwhile , the GB concept has a longer service life , but its power capacity is too low even to perform the cold start function of the vehicle [ 37 ] . Likewise , it is identified that the weight of LAB increases , reducing their viability as a traction technology . During 2003 - 2013 , vehicle designers seek to build cars that meet the emissions and fuel consumption challenges promoted by the regulatory institutions of the United States and the European Union , and that are attractive to consumers [ 39 ] . Automotive industry responds defining various complementary routes . Transition from analog mechanical systems to digital electromechanical systems was consolidated and expanded , not only in VEAs , also in internal combustion vehicles ( ICE ) . Acceleration systems , electronic driving control , driver assistance ( ADAS ) , infotainment , comfort and the incorporation of autonomous driving systems , have increased the number and complexity of computers , harnesses , programming codes , cameras , systems of communication and actuators of the vehicles [ 47 , 48 ] . These systems are delicate Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

Ixtapa , Mexico and traction batteries , subject to large voltage changes , pose a risk to vehicle performance and user safety . A viable and economical solution , due to the low specific cost of raw materials , the mature and cost - optimized manufacturing technology , the robustness of the battery , its low - temperature discharge power , heat tolerance , and low self - discharge [ 40 ] , for the provision of energy to these systems is the development of a dual battery system , which consists of a passive parallel connection between an auxiliary battery , low power ( 12V ) , and a main battery , high power ( 12V or more ) . The dual battery system guarantees the ability to start the combustion engine and maintain vehicle mobility even in the event of failure or loss of the main battery , which is especially important when you have a high degree of electronic vehicle automation ( the electromechanical power steering system ( EPS ) or the electrohydraulic breakaway system ( EHB ) ) [ 49 , 50 ] . V . C ONCLUSIONS Theoretical works of technological change agree that : combination of new and existing technological capabilities is the main source of inventive novelty . Under this combinatorial view , three perspectives dominate the discussion : Gradualism , Combination / Accumulation , and Recombination of natural phenomena . For their part , empirical studies provide general aspects of innovation using the number of patents and the number of claims as indicators of inventive activity , however , there is no methodological consensus for the empirical analysis of the recombinatorial process . In summary , there are controversies both in the theoretical and empirical fields about the treatment of technological recombination . Methodology of Strumsky et al [ 11 , 12 , 30 ] uses patent classes to identify the degree of technological complexity and four types of inventive novelty ( origination , new combination , recombination and reuse ) for innovations registered in the USPTO . However , his theoretical approach is typical of gradualism . Their findings conclude that new technologies are more likely to emerge from existing technologies , and this implies that innovations emerge through the reuse and recombination of previously generated skills and knowledge , consequently , they are typical of exploitation activities . It does not have an explanation of the emergence of absolutely new knowledge , nor of the reasons that explain the emergence and increase in complexity . Methodology of Strumsky et al [ 11 , 12 , 30 ] contributes to systematically measure technological complexity and to classify novelty , but when assuming a theoretical perspective , to understand the complexity and the recombination process , care must be taken , as this can lead to misleading interpretations , confused or incomplete . This work contributes to the study of technological evolution by establishing a bridge between the " recombination of natural phenomena " approach [ 7 ] and the " taxonomy of novelty " [ 11 , 12 , 30 ] for the case specific to LAB . The analysis allow us to identify the following patterns :  Changes in trend and composition of inventive activity of batteries for AEVs . Between 1981 - 1991 , LAB were the dominant design due to their economical characteristics , their technological progress developed over more than a century , and the lack of knowledge of the technical requirements of a traction battery . During 1992 - 2002 , although the participation of LAB continues to be relevant ( 40 % of patents ) , it is displaced by LI , NMH and NC batteries ( representing 29 % , 25 % and 6 % , respectively ) . In contrast , its inventive activity is growing rapidly , going from 18 annual average patents in the first period to 40 in this second . Between 2003 - 2013 , LAB patents represent only 11 % of battery inventions for AEVs and , their inventive activity slows down ( from 438 to 264 patents ) . However , these prevail as auxiliary batteries suitable for supplying and managing energy for electrical / electronic and digital applications in vehicles . Also , as a central energy device for light electric vehicles .  Slightly and gradually increasing in the complexity of LAB . Annual average of classes goes from 3 to 4 , during 1981 - 2013 . This increase is the result of the discovery and convergence of phenomena ( nanotechnological applications ; discoveries in new materials ) and technological domains ( advances in electrochemistry or computation .  Novelty configuration have changed between periods . But origination is the main type of novelty in LAB . This indicates that , despite LAB being a mature technology , a high rate of original invention remains , followed by increasing refinement activity .  Balance between exploration and exploitation activities predominates in the innovation of LAB . The search for solutions has tended from origination and new combination patents , associated with exploration ( from 76 % in the first period to 50 . 9 % and 47 . 3 % in subsequent periods ) to recombination and reuse patents , associated with exploitation ( represent for each period 24 % , 49 . 1 % and 52 . 7 % , respectively ) . For more than 150 years , automotive industry has used LAB and , despite the drastic change it has undergone , it continues to innovate in this battery , with newer , more complex and advanced technologies ( VRLA , ALC , EFL ) that , as sources reliable , low - cost , long - lasting power have been tailored to meet the requirements of AEVs ( as an auxiliary battery ) ; of the ICE + , MHVs and MHEVs ( as main battery ) and ; of micro - vehicles and single - seaters ( as a traction battery ) .
