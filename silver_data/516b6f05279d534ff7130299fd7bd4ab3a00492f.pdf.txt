Autologous tissue transfer is the standard treatment for such defects , but is hindered by donor site morbidity , risk of infection , poor cosmetic and functional outcome , and reduced graft integrity . Allografts are an insufﬁcient solution due to immune response and a lack of sufﬁcient donor tissues . Synthetic materials suffer from erosion , infection and poor outcome .

Long bones have a complex hierarchal vascular structure consisting of diaphyseal , metaphyseal , epiphyseal and periosteal arteries . Due to their high metabolic need , osteocytes are typically within 100 l m of a blood vessel [ 1 ] . Capillar - ies within Haversian and Volkmann canals supply the osteons ( Fig . 1 ) , and vasculature in the surrounding periosteum supplies nutrients , oxygen and osteoblast progenitor cells to superﬁcial regions [ 2 , 3 ] . Vascularization and bone formation are highly linked . It is widely agreed that vascularization occurs prior to osteogenesis during both embryonic development and healing of adult bone . During foetal development , mesenchymal precursors in the embryonic limb bud differentiate into chondrocytes , assemble into an avascular cartilagi - nous bone template and then secrete extracellular matrix and the angiogenic protein VEGF [ 4 ] . VEGF initiates angiogenesis from nearby vessels , creating a vascular network within the matrix which allows for osteoprogenitor cell migration , differentiation and subsequent bone formation [ 4 ] . In adult bones , a ﬁbrin clot forms within a dam - aged region following an injury . The clot serves as a provisional matrix for invasion of vascular networks . This granulation tissue is ﬁrst replaced by ﬁbrocartilage tissue that is remodelled as bone develops . The extent of bone formation is reduced if the vasculariza - tion process is interrupted [ 5 , 6 ] . The vasculature regulates bone formation in a variety of ways . It serves as a source of oxygen , nutrients and progenitor cells but also regulates bone behaviour through direct interactions between endo - thelial cells ( ECs ) and bone cells . Endothelial cells induce differentia - tion of osteoprogenitor cells [ 7 ] and enhance osteoblastic gene expression independent of perfusion [ 8 ] . This is a reciprocal relation - ship , as osteoblasts stimulate tube - like structure formation of ECs in vitro [ 8 ] and induce angiogenesis in vivo [ 9 ] , resulting , in part , from secretion of VEGF [ 10 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) , which reside in bone marrow , interact with ECs [ 11 ] and promote angiogen - esis [ 12 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow endothelial pro - genitor cells ( EPCs ) in co - culture results in increased alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity , expression of angiogenic and bone mark - ers , and tubulogenesis in comparison to monoculture of either cell type [ 13 ] . Interactions between vascular and bone cells are vital to the development , function and stabilization of bone . Cellular crosstalk A complex network of communication occurs between ECs and osteo - blasts , osteoclasts and osteoprogenitor cells . One of the primary mechanisms by which this communication occurs is through the secretion of soluble factors . Mesenchymal stem cells secrete a num - ber of soluble factors that can inﬂuence nearby ECs , including VEGF , angiopoietin - 1 ( Ang - 1 ) , basic ﬁbroblast growth factor , platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) [ 11 , 14 ] . VEGF acts on ECs to induce angiogenesis and also binds to VEGF receptors on osteoblasts to induce bone formation [ 15 , 16 ] and stimulate bone repair [ 9 ] . VEGF receptor - 2 ( VEGFR2 ) is expressed in bone tissue , and its activation by VEGF is required for osteoblastic cell proliferation , differentiation and survival [ 17 , 18 ] . Bone morphoge - netic proteins ( BMPs ) promote angiogenesis by inducing osteoblastic secretion of VEGF [ 19 ] , and also play a major role in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation [ 20 , 21 ] . Bone morphogenetic protein - 2 is involved in the crosstalk between EPCs and MSCs , as it is secreted by MSCs and induces chemotaxis of EPCs [ 22 ] . Cellular production of osteogenic and angiogenic factors plays a key role in intercellular communication within bone tissue . Gap junctions allow for direct cytoplasmic connections between two cells and are essential for cellular communication within bone . Connexin43 ( Cx43 ) is the most abundant gap junction protein in bone tissue and plays a critical role in its development and maintenance . Deﬁciency in Cx43 results in general osteoblast dysfunction and delayed ossiﬁcation [ 23 ] . Cx43 is also present in the endothelium of stable microvasculature and a reduction in Cx43 may reduce the angiogenic potential of EPCs [ 24 ] . Due to the common presence of Cx43 in vasculature and bone , it is widely hypothesized that ECs and osteoblasts communicate through this connection . Human osteo - blasts and dermal microvascular ECs can couple through Cx43 [ 25 ] , and the Cx43 coupling of human umbilical vein ECs ( HUVECs ) and bone marrow stromal cells can regulate osteoblastic gene expression and differentiation [ 26 ] . Cx43 not only serves to passively bind mole - cules , but also actively participates in cell signalling process by recruiting signalling factors to inﬂuence which signals are transmitted [ 27 ] . Cell communication via Cx43 is essential for the maintenance and function of bone tissue . Design criteria for clinical success Bone regeneration continues to be one of the most active areas of tis - sue engineering research . It is well - established that vascularization is critical to the ﬁeld and there are a number of excellent reviews that discuss strategies for engineering vascularized bone [ 1 , 5 , 28 – 32 ] . However , these reviews primarily focus on developments in basic Fig . 1 Section of porcine rib stained with haematoxylin and eosin dem - onstrating the microstructure of bone . Arrows denote Haversian canals . Scale bar represents 100 l m . 904 ª 2015 The Authors .

The focus of this review is on the potential for clinical applica - tion of tissue engineering strategies under development . The clinical relevance of a particular tissue - engineered bone strategy depends on several factors , including size and volume of the defect / scaffold , mechanical strength , availability of cells , surgical practicality and cost - effectiveness . In most cases , one primary role of the skeletal system is mechanical support . The strength of any bone tissue implant is fundamental to maintaining appropriate function . The mechanical properties vary signiﬁcantly within a given bone [ 33 ] and between types of bone . The elastic moduli of native trabecular and cortical bone are approximately 10 – 15 and 18 – 20 GPa , respectively [ 34 ] . Craniofacial bone has a mechanical strength ~ 2 orders of magni - tude lower than long bones . The mandibular condyle has an elastic modulus of approximately 120 – 440 MPa depending on orientation [ 35 ] . When an implant has a tensile strength far greater than native bone , stress shielding can occur and result in resorption of sur - rounding bone due to underutilization [ 36 ] . In tissue engineering , it is more common that the strength is lower relative to native bone . The polymer scaffolds used are either unable to achieve the appro - priate strength or the mechanical properties decrease rapidly after implantation due to degradation . This results in a structurally weak defect prone to failure . Strategies have been proposed in which an implanted engineered bone is combined with a transient support structure that allows for mechanical development in situ . The sup - port structure would then be removed once the implanted bone developed sufﬁcient strength . Engineering bone of sufﬁcient volume to treat large defects com - monly encountered in the clinic is one of the most signiﬁcant barriers to application . Critical - sized defects in simple fractures in humans often result in a 2 – 3 cm gap [ 30 ] , and defects resulting from trauma or tumour resection can be much larger . Tissue engineering strate - gies are commonly evaluated in much smaller volumes than what is required for reconstruction of large clinical defects . For these approaches to be clinically applicable , they will need to be successful when scaled up . The 3D shape of the defect is also of critical impor - tance . Irregular or complex shapes are difﬁcult to match and poor graft ﬁt can lead to non - union with surrounding bone . The large majority of tissue engineering strategies apply cells to scaffolds to enhance tissue formation . For these techniques to be realized clinically , cell sources would need to be readily available . When evaluating vascularization of tissues , many studies use ‘model’ cell types , such as HUVECs which may form extensive vascular net - works in vitro and in vivo [ 37 , 38 ] . However , these cells are not avail - able in the potential patient population . Results discovered with similar ‘model’ cells or cell lines need to be conﬁrmed with autolo - gous cell sources such as EPCs or MSCs , which can be isolated from adults . Mesenchymal stem cells are primarily extracted from bone marrow or adipose tissue , while EPCs are generally isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow . While these cells have the potential to be isolated from the targeted populations they may have altered function due to age or disease [ 39 , 40 ] . Other cell types that are not involved in the natural bone healing process have also been investi - gated in bone tissue engineering , including embryonic stem cells [ 41 ] and induced pluripotent stem cells [ 42 , 43 ] . Induced pluripotent stem cells are created from adult ﬁbroblasts by the transduction of four genes that reprogram the cell back to a pluripotent stem cell pheno - type [ 44 ] . These cells can then be differentiated into bone and / or EC lineages for the formation of vascularized bone , which makes them of signiﬁcant clinical interest . Surgical practicality and cost - effectiveness are necessary for a technique to become standard of care . Strategies involving multiple surgeries or implant locations increase the risk of complications and associated costs . In addition , the medical community ( surgeons , hos - pital administration , etc . ) must be willing to adopt a new procedure . This may require that the treatment have signiﬁcantly improved out - come in comparison to current standards of care . The decision is also inﬂuenced by trends , personal preferences , patient opinion and cost . Cost - effectiveness is an increasingly important consideration in any clinical treatment . Strategies that require extended in vitro culture , complex scaffold materials or preparation , or expensive proteins may place a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden on patients and / or the healthcare system . With continuously evolving healthcare systems , tissue engi - neers must proceed with careful consideration of approaches that may ultimately be cost - prohibitive . In this review , we discuss literature on vascularized bone forma - tion with an emphasis on these important clinical considerations . Var - ious strategies based on cellular implantation , growth factor delivery , scaffold design and surgical pre - fabrication are described in more detail in the following sections . Each section includes a discussion of challenges to the clinical translation of the strategies . Cell - based strategies Many approaches for engineering vascularized bone consist of a bio - material scaffold seeded with cells . Cell types typically include an EC source ( such as EPCs or HUVECs ) and a bone source , often osteo - blasts or stem cells ( mesenchymal or adipose - derived ) . The scaffolds may be supplemented with soluble factors or matrix proteins in an attempt to further enhance tissue formation . Cells and scaffolds Several groups have investigated the use of polymer scaffolds com - bined with a single cell source to engineer vascularized bone . There have been numerous studies in which MSCs ( bone marrow or adi - pose derived ) have been seeded on a scaffold , resulting in increased osteogenesis in model systems in vivo [ 45 – 48 ] . These approaches do not directly attempt to build vessels within the scaffolds . Instead , they depend on host vessel ingrowth in response to the release of para - crine factors by the implanted MSCs . Mesenchymal stem cells , regardless of the source , release pro - angiogenic factors upon implan - tation , including VEGF , BMP - 2 , and Ang - 1 [ 12 ] . In these approaches , vascularization may also result from direct assembly of MSCs into vascular structures [ 49 – 51 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells can participate in vessel assembly by functioning as peri - vascular support cells [ 49 ] , or a subset of MSCs may be able to ª 2015 The Authors .

Vol 19 , No 5 , 2015 directly differentiate along the EC lineage [ 50 , 51 ] . This phenomenon has been exploited to form vascularized structures using MSCs alone . Cell sheet constructs of bone marrow MSCs were shown to differenti - ate into both angiogenic and osteogenic lineages and form vascular - ized bone following implantation in vivo [ 52 ] . Ossiﬁed trabeculae , woven bone and medullary cavities were all found in the newly devel - oped bone [ 52 ] . Endothelial cells derived from adipose derived stem cells ( ASCs ) have also been shown to improve vascularization of bone allografts in critical sized calvarial defects [ 53 ] . In this case , it is not clear if the seeded cells directly form vascular networks or stimulate vascularization from surrounding host vessels via the release of angiogenic factors . Interestingly , combining these ECs with ASC - derived OBs in the same model resulted in less bone volume and mi - crovessel density than ASC - derived ECs alone [ 53 ] . This could result from the lack of sufﬁcient porosity in the scaffolds potentially com - promising the viability of the ASC - derived OBs [ 53 ] . A more common strategy is to seed cells from both osteogenic and endothelial lineages into a scaffold to coordinate new bone for - mation and vessel assembly . Demineralized bone matrix scaffolds seeded with both bone marrow - derived EPCs and MSCs resulted in a signiﬁcantly higher blood supply , biomechanical strength and bone mineral density than scaffolds without EPCs when implanted in a seg - mental defect model [ 54 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells combined with EPCs and seeded on polyurethane scaffolds with hydroxyapatite ( HA ) nanoparticles formed tubular structures in vitro after 7 days and exhibited earlier osteogenic differentiation than in monoculture [ 55 ] . HUVECs formed elongated networks and stimulated increased early osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs on three - dimen - sional porous beta - tricalcium phosphate ( b - TCP ) scaffolds in vitro [ 56 ] . Pericyte - like MSCs have been also shown to increase the stabil - ity of HUVEC networks within mineralized tissue [ 57 ] . Cell spheroids have been investigated in a variety of tissue engi - neering applications due to increased cell - cell interactions [ 58 ] and the ability to induce 3D sprouting of ECs [ 38 ] . Osteoblast / human der - mal microvascular endothelial cells co - culture spheroids implanted in a dorsal skinfold chamber model without any additional scaffold formed a vascular network that demonstrated initial inosculation by day 3 and extensive perfusion by day 14 [ 59 ] . HUVEC spheroids with osteoblasts seeded onto processed bovine cancellous bone ( PBCB ) scaffolds implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice formed dense , functional vascular networks that anastomosed with host vessels within the 21 - day implantation period [ 60 ] . In a following study , decalciﬁed PBCB scaffolds seeded with HUVEC spheroids and osteo - genically predifferentiated MSCs improved angiogenesis and pro - moted bone regeneration in a mouse cranial defect model [ 61 ] . These studies show that the combination of ECs and bone cells can increase both bone formation and vascularization . A more com - plex approach involves assembly of ECs into a vascular network in a scaffold in vitro prior to implantation . The goal of this approach is to achieve rapid and enhanced perfusion of the networks following implantation in vivo [ 62 , 63 ] . Generation of a vascular network prior to initiating osteogenesis in vitro results in increased bone volume and vascular structures in vivo [ 64 ] . HUVECs and MSCs were encap - sulated in ﬁbrin , seeded onto decellularized bone scaffolds , and then incubated for 2 weeks in endothelial growth media followed by 4 weeks with additional MSCs and osteogenic media [ 64 ] . When these scaffolds were implanted , they exhibited bone formation with a vascu - lar network that anastomosed in vivo in under 2 weeks [ 64 ] . HUVECs seeded into collagen - glycosaminoglycan scaffolds formed networks within 6 days in vitro [ 65 ] . The addition of MSCs to the HUVEC - seeded scaffolds halfway through in vitro culture resulted in enhanced vessel formation and higher vessel density following implantation in vivo , with the MSCs exhibiting a pericyte - like stabilizing role [ 65 ] . The periosteum is a rich source of vasculature and osteoprogeni - tor cells that is known to enhance bone formation and healing . A tis - sue engineered periosteum is an emerging strategy for enhancing the formation of vascularized bone . HA / poly ( ester urethane ) scaffolds surrounded by a platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) gel and seeded with MSCs have been investigated as an engineered periosteal substitute [ 66 ] . The engineered periosteum scaffold functioned as a source of growth factors and improved bone growth in rabbit ulnar defects after 4 months [ 66 ] . This approach primarily treated the periosteum as a rich source of progenitor cells . However , the high vascular density of the periosteum is also important to its ability to enhance bone growth . Work in the area of engineered periosteum has not yet addressed the important issue of vascularity . Despite the success of cell - based bone tissue engineering strate - gies in research settings , many of the techniques used model cell types ( e . g . HUVECs ) that are not a realistic cell source for clinical treatment of patients . In addition , the cells that are actually available in the potential patient population have substantial variability in osteo - genic or angiogenic potential that could hinder translation into clinical application [ 28 ] . For example , EPCs isolated from the peripheral blood exhibit increased angiogenic potential over those derived from the bone marrow [ 67 ] . Age or co - morbidities may also affect the presence or function of cell sources in the patient population [ 68 , 69 ] . Adipose - derived MSCs from aged patients with coronary artery dis - ease exhibit decreased secretion of angiogenic factors [ 70 ] . Addition - ally , prolonged in vitro culture expansion could decrease the proliferation , differentiation potential and bone formation potential of MSCs [ 71 ] . These factors are signiﬁcant questions that need to be answered for cell - based strategies . Cells and soluble factors Cell - based therapies are often supplemented with growth factor deliv - ery strategies designed to enhance cell function and integration . Growth factors commonly used in tissue engineering of vascularized bone include VEGF , BMP - 2 and PDGF - BB . These are chosen for their beneﬁcial effects on ECs , osteogenic cells or both [ 72 ] . PDGF - BB secreted by ECs also plays a key role in recruitment and proliferation of vessel stabilizing pericytes [ 73 ] . These soluble factors can be intro - duced to a system through gene therapy and / or polymer delivery systems . A number of combined cell and growth factor delivery systems have been investigated for tissue engineering of vascularized bone in vitro and in vivo . Addition of physiologically relevant concentrations of PDGF - BB to growth media enhanced both angiogenesis and osteo - genesis in vitro in ASC spheroids encapsulated in ﬁbrin gels [ 74 ] . 906 ª 2015 The Authors . Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine . Degradable poly ( DL - lactic acid ) scaffolds encapsulated with VEGF and seeded with bone marrow MSCs exhibited increased bone vol - ume and blood vessel formation following implantation in vivo [ 75 ] . In lieu of adding a single growth factor , multiple soluble factors can be delivered simultaneously through the use of PRP [ 76 ] . Platelet - rich plasma consists of plasma and platelets from autologous blood and contains soluble factors secreted by platelets , including PDGF , VEGF , IGF - 1 and von Willebrand Factor [ 76 ] . Platelet - rich plasma - loaded alginate microspheres seeded with ASCs exhibited enhanced minerali - zation and formation of an anastomosed capillary network in vivo [ 77 ] . Gene therapy is often used to target a sustained delivery of growth factors [ 78 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells transduced with a recombinant adenoviral vector carrying BMP - 2 displayed increased ALP activity , type I collagen expression , matrix mineralization and bone formation in vitro and in vivo [ 79 ] . Hypoxia inducible factor - 1 ( HIF - 1 a ) regulates oxygen homeostasis , targets VEGF and activates the transcription of several angiogenic genes [ 80 , 81 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells overex - pressing HIF - 1 a and seeded within gelatin sponge scaffolds exhibited signiﬁcantly upregulated expression of angiogenic factors in vitro and created substantial blood vessel networks within mineralized tissue in vivo [ 81 ] . Bone marrow MSCs genetically modiﬁed to over - express VEGF seeded in a scaffold of silicate - substituted apatite granules in a ﬁbrin gel created dense vascular networks in nude rats , though this resulted in a reduced quality of bone mineralization [ 82 ] . This may result from increased degradation of bone due to increased osteoclast differentiation [ 82 ] . Other studies with VEGF - overexpressing cells did not report this phenomenon [ 83 ] , indicating that more research into the mechanisms behind this shift in bone homeostasis is necessary . Though these techniques show potential for clinical success , cost and safety remain signiﬁcant considerations that may inhibit clinical implementation . Applications of large amounts of soluble factors and cells even for relatively small defects may be costly . Cells that overex - press soluble factors may be an efﬁcient method for growth factor delivery , but the paracrine effects of high growth factor concentration could be a concern . Ectopic growth in untargeted regions is also a risk of growth factor therapies as has been seen clinically for studies involving BMPs [ 84 ] . Bioreactors Bioreactors have been widely investigated in tissue engineering to enable long - term culture of large engineered tissues . The techniques are typically focused on enhancing nutrient transport in scaffolds in the absence of functional vascular networks . Several weeks of culture is often necessary for optimal tissue growth and development . For bone applications , bioreactors may also enhance osteogenic differen - tiation of MSCs due to shear stress resulting from media ﬂow [ 85 ] . Cell behaviour in the bioreactors depends on a variety of factors , including ﬂow conditions , cells used , and biomaterial environment . Steady ﬂow followed by pulsatile ﬂow increased mineralization and mechanical strength of ASC - seeded porous silk ﬁbroin scaffolds in a bioreactor [ 86 ] . A tubular perfusion bioreactor was shown to enhance osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of MSCs encapsulated in alginate beads as a function of ﬂow rate [ 87 ] . Perfusion culture resulted in a more uniform distribution of cells and matrix in compari - son to static conditions when HUVECs and MSCs ( in monoculture or co - culture ) were seeded onto electrospun poly ( e - caprolactone ) ( PCL ) scaffolds and incubated in osteogenic medium [ 88 ] . In addition , increased mineralization was observed in perfusion MSC cultures rel - ative to static co - culture [ 88 ] . This was not seen in perfusion co - cul - ture , possibly due to shear stress affecting the function of HUVECs [ 88 ] , as EC function varies with shear stress [ 89 ] . While the strategies discussed above have shown that bioreactors can be used to enhance engineered bone formation , there has been little investigation into formation of vascular networks within scaf - folds in a bioreactor setting . In one study , MSCs and MSC - derived ECs seeded on a porous poly ( lactic acid ) scaffold assembled into vas - cular - like structures within bone tissue in a rotating wall vessel biore - actor [ 90 ] . Endothelial cells were grown in the bioreactor in EGM for 1 week prior to the addition of MSCs and the induction of osteogenic differentiation for an additional week [ 90 ] . Additionally , the co - culture bioreactor conditions exhibited increased spatial distribution and pro - liferation relative to static controls [ 90 ] . Bioreactor strategies have seen some success in clinical studies , but these efforts have not yet transitioned to clinical use for bone tis - sue engineering . A primary concern is cost . The cost of a clinical bio - reactor bone graft has been estimated to be $ 10 , 000 – $ 15 , 000 , taking into account the cost of cells , labour , testing , miscellaneous expenses and a portion of the initial cost to set up a bioreactor system ( esti - mated at $ 25 , 000 – $ 35 , 000 ) [ 91 ] . However , this is only an estimate of the graft cost and does not include surgical and hospital costs that would also be incurred for the procedure . In addition , the large vol - umes of tissues potentially generated in a bioreactor will need to be combined with strategies that promote rapid vascularization in order for the constructs to survive post - transplantation . Bioreactor strate - gies will likely need to implement approaches for creating vascular networks within the scaffolds for successful clinical implementation . However , the high costs and long culture times present a signiﬁcant challenge to ultimate clinical acceptance . Cell - free strategies Not all tissue engineering strategies focus on the application of iso - lated cells . Cell - free strategies avoid issues of cell sourcing by focus - ing on the ability to induce surrounding cells to invade and generate bone of sufﬁcient volume in time frames appropriate for clinical suc - cess . Typically , this is done through the delivery of growth factors or the application of specially designed bio - active scaffolds . Growth factor delivery VEGF is one of the most widely investigated growth factors for con - trolled stimulation of angiogenesis . An injectable alginate hydrogel releasing VEGF was shown to enhance angiogenesis in a rodent cra - nial defect model and concomitantly enhanced bone regeneration in the absence of additional cells [ 92 ] . Phosphonic acid self - assembled ª 2015 The Authors . Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine . 907 J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 19 , No 5 , 2015 monolayers ( SAMs ) were used to modify HA scaffold surfaces to bind VEGF to the interior surface of the scaffold as another sustained deliv - ery strategy [ 93 ] . Human aortic ECs seeded onto the VEGF - bound , SAM - coated scaffolds saw an increase of proliferation and angiogenic activity compared to HA scaffolds alone , with VEGF remaining on the surface for up to 28 days in vitro [ 93 ] . Bone morphogenetic protein - 2 has been studied extensively in bone tissue engineering due its signiﬁcant role in the induction of bone formation [ 21 ] . It is also known to possess pro - angiogenic properties [ 19 ] and play a role in the crosstalk between EPCs and MSCs [ 22 ] . Critical - sized femoral segmental defects in rats were trea - ted with an injectable alginate hydrogel for BMP - 2 delivery combined with an electrospun PCL nanoﬁbre mesh for guided bone regenera - tion [ 94 ] . Bone healing was observed after 4 weeks and substantial bone formation after 12 weeks [ 94 ] . VEGF and BMP - 2 can also be delivered simultaneously to stimulate bone and vascular network for - mation . Dual - delivery of VEGF and BMP - 2 via gelatin microparticles within a porous poly ( propylene fumarate ) scaffold resulted in increased bone and blood vessel volume in a rat cranial defect model ( Fig . 2 ) [ 95 ] . Though VEGF and BMP - 2 dual delivery had similar amounts of bone formation as BMP - 2 alone , dual delivery may enhance bone bridging and union of the defect [ 95 ] . This synergistic effect may be model - speciﬁc . In a study using lower doses of VEGF and BMP - 2 , the effect of BMP - 2 on bone growth was found to be dose - dependent [ 96 ] . The addition of higher amounts of VEGF did not offset the decreased bone formation observed with low concentra - tions of BMP - 2 [ 96 ] . The effects of BMP - 2 and VEGF dual delivery may also be dependent on location and rate of release [ 97 ] . Growth factor delivery treatments appear successful in many small volume pre - clinical studies , but large volume bone defects present additional challenges that must be overcome . Many strategies have only been tested in small volume applications , and scaling up for large volume defects may present issues . Vascular in growth from the host may be too slow to overcome ischaemia throughout the entire implant volume . Treatments with multiple growth factors may beneﬁt from synergistic interactions , however , the cost of recombi - nant proteins is high . The requirement of greater amounts of proteins for large volume defects will only further increase price . Researchers need to identify the minimal elements needed for success and may be able to reduce dose through the use of controlled delivery strategies .

Scaffold design techniques include developing new materials , investigating novel fabrication methods or optimizing mechanical or physical properties to improve osseointegration and vascularization [ 98 ] . Bioactive glass [ 99 ] has been utilized in bone tissue engineering applications due to its osteoconductive properties . Additionally , bio - active glass has also been shown to have pro - angiogenic proper - ties , particularly 45S5 glass ( a silicate - based glass ) [ 100 ] . Direct or indirect cellular contact with 45S5 glass can result in increases in angiogenic indicators [ 100 ] , which makes this material of particular interest for vascularized bone applications . Bioactive glass scaffolds of various compositions were implanted in a rat cranial defect model for 12 weeks and displayed new bone formation , HA conver - sion and blood vessel inﬁltration [ 101 ] . Samples with 45S5 glass had highest blood vessel area , while 1393B3 ( borate - based ) had the highest amount of bone formation and converted completely to HA [ 101 ] . Bioactive glass foam scaffolds of 70S30C ( 70 % SiO 2 , 30 % CaO ) composition demonstrated evidence of remodelling by osteo - clasts as well as supported EC tube formation in vitro [ 102 ] . Meso - porous bioactive glass scaffolds may offer increased bioactivity and degradation [ 103 ] , and can also be used for drug delivery . One study combined osteogenic mesoporous bioactive glass with a strategy to induce angiogenesis through the induction of HIF - 1 a via cobalt ions [ 104 ] . Hypoxia - mimicking mesoporous bioactive glass scaffolds were created by incorporating 2 % or 5 % Co 2 + ions to replace parts of Ca 2 + ions , then seeded with bone marrow stromal cells and cultured for 7 days in vitro [ 104 ] . Cells extracted from these scaffolds exhibited signiﬁcantly increased HIF - 1 a and VEGF gene expression and VEGF secretion , suggesting the induction of the hypoxic cascade , which may stimulate neovascularization in vivo [ 104 ] . Scaffolds have been designed with physical and chemical fea - tures designed to enhance bone formation . The degradation rate of biomaterials can inﬂuence tissue development . Hyaluronic acid hy - drogels with controlled degradation properties have been investi - gated to encourage oriented bone growth when combined with soluble factors [ 105 ] . Hydrogels loaded with BMP - 2 and / or VEGF were implanted into a rat cranial defect model for up to 6 weeks [ 105 ] . Fast - degrading BMP - 2 loaded hydrogels had increased ori - ented collagen area compared to slow and intermediate degradation rate [ 105 ] . Dual delivery of BMP - 2 and VEGF in fast - degrading hyal - uronic acid hydrogels resulted in increased mineral volume over BMP - 2 and VEGF alone [ 105 ] . Shell - core bi - layered PCL scaffolds developed to mimic osteon structure were able to stimulate bone tis - sue formation in the shell and blood vessel formation in the core region [ 106 ] . Seeding the inner core with mouse ECs and the outer shell layer with mouse pre - osteoblasts resulted in osteogenic differ - entiation of the pre - osteoblasts and formation of a continuous lining of ECs mimicking Haversian canals [ 106 ] . 3D - printing allows for the rapid generation of custom - shaped scaffolds from a variety of start - ing materials . 3D - printed porous PCL scaffolds seeded with ASC aggregates suspended in ﬁbrin gel formed integrated vascularized tissue with dense mineral deposits within the scaffolds after 2 weeks of culture in vitro [ 107 ] . Scaffolds were designed with uniform pore size and ﬁbre width with 40 % inﬁll density to support cellular inﬁltration and allow for uniform distribution of cellular aggregates throughout the pores [ 107 ] . After subcutaneous implantation for 1 week in vivo , scaffolds seeded with ASC aggregates exhibited increased cellularity and vascular density , particularly within the cen - tre of the scaffold [ 107 ] . Vessel formation was further increased in scaffolds that were pre - vascularized for 18 - days in vitro prior to implantation [ 107 ] . These scaffolds can also be created in the shape and volume of a human mandible and maxilla from computerized tomography ( CT ) scans [ 107 ] , indicating the potential for patient - speciﬁc scaffolds to be used clinically . Using bioactive materials to induce bone formation may be an effective treatment method that avoids the cost and risks associated with cells and soluble factors . However , many of these strategies may need to be supplemented with cells or soluble factors to optimize bone volume . Designing scaffolds to best mimic the structure of bone and its vasculature shows potential to speed bone formation by increasing the availability of nutrients and progenitor cells . The recent widespread popularity of 3D printing may make these techniques more accessible and clinically feasible , and could lead to further improvements in the design of patient - speciﬁc scaffolds . Surgical approaches Tissue engineering has often progressed with the goal of engineering ready - to - implant , fully functional tissues . These strategies sometimes neglect the inevitable remodelling process that occurs following implantation [ 108 ] . Surgeons , on the other hand , have a long history of utilizing the body’s own healing and inﬂammatory processes to enhance tissue vascularization . Recently , surgical approaches have been used to assist in enhancing construct vascularization within the patient prior to implantation at the defect site [ 109 ] . These techniques have the advantages of exploiting the patient’s own healing capacity by implantation in an ectopic location selected , in part , on an ability to enhance vascularization . A vascular bundle inserted within a scaffold can help prefabricate the construct to improve vascularization and bone formation . An in vivo bioreactor was created in rabbits by implanting a tissue engineering strategy around the saphenous vessel bundle and wrap - ping it with the muscularis membrane [ 110 ] . Application of b - TCP granules embedded with BMP - 2 modiﬁed bone marrow MSCs in this model resulted in active bone formation with an increased capillary density made from autologous cells after 4 weeks [ 110 ] . b - TCP scaf - folds created with a groove to house the femoral vascular bundle were seeded with osteogenically differentiated MSCs [ 111 ] . The MSCs were differentiated for 3 weeks in vitro and allowed to adhere on scaffolds overnight prior to implantation in critical - sized segmental femoral defects in rabbits [ 111 ] . Bone remodelling with a bone mar - row cavity was observed after 8 weeks . Prefabricated scaffolds had higher vascular density with more spatial uniformity , whereas scaf - folds without prefabrication had vessels localized primarily at the periphery of the scaffold [ 111 ] . A surgically induced periosteal membrane takes advantage of the body’s natural healing processes and has been characterized in humans [ 112 ] . To induce membrane growth , a poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ª 2015 The Authors . Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine . 909 J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 19 , No 5 , 2015 ( PMMA ) cement spacer is placed within a critical sized bone defect and removed 6 – 8 weeks later [ 112 , 113 ] . A membrane grows around this spacer , and , similar to native periosteum , it contains MSCs , ECs , and growth factors essential for bone regeneration [ 112 ] . The induced periosteal membrane has been shown to pre - vent resorption of implanted cancellous bone graft and encourage vascularization [ 113 ] . While this has not been explored previously , a tissue engineering strategy could also be implanted into this opti - mized healing environment . A one - step procedure could be possible if a tissue engineering strategy was able to induce membrane growth in place of the PMMA spacer . An engineered periosteum may further accelerate the healing process by emulating the role of native periosteum in autograft healing [ 114 ] . Bone allografts were coated with degradable poly ( ethylene glycol ) hydrogels in a murine segmental femoral graft model to deliver MSCs and act as a mock periosteum [ 115 ] . Defects treated with tissue engineered perios - teum exhibited increased vascular volume , bone callus formation and mechanical stability compared to untreated allografts [ 115 ] . Existing periosteum can be exploited as a source of osteoprogeni - tor cells and vasculature to enhance ectopic bone formation . Follow - ing ectopic growth and development of a tissue engineering chamber implanted against the periosteum , the new tissue can then be trans - ferred to the defect site as a vascularized tissue . Chambers containing autologous morselized bone graft ( MBG ) implanted against rib perios - teum in sheep generated signiﬁcant calciﬁed tissue within the cham - bers , with maximal after 8 weeks of implantation [ 116 ] . A similar approach was used to generate the mental protuberance of the man - dible , using anatomically shaped chambers ( Fig . 3 ) [ 117 ] . Active bone formation and calciﬁed tissue area increased over 12 weeks of implantation , with chamber volume peaking at 9 weeks prior to sig - niﬁcant tissue regression [ 117 ] . This procedure was translated clini - cally in a patient to augment mandible height during reconstruction [ 118 ] . An MBG - ﬁlled chamber was implanted against rib periosteum for 8 weeks , at which time the bone graft and periosteum were har - vested and transferred to the mandible . The engineered bone graft remained viable after 16 months , and histology showed the formation of compact bone with numerous Haversian systems and mature osteocytes [ 118 ] . One approach that has been studied extensively for other engi - neered tissues is the arteriovenous - loop model [ 119 ] . In this proce - dure , the saphenous artery and vein are microsurgically dissected and anastomosed together to form a loop , which is placed inside a custom - made isolation chamber containing a tissue engineering strat - egy and ﬁxed to the underlying fascia [ 120 ] . The AV - loop provides large vessels within the engineered tissues , enhances vascularization , and can be used later for microsurgical tissue transfer to a defect location . b - TCP - HA granules with MSCs and recombinant human BMP - 2 were implanted in sheep around an arteriovenous - loop for 12 weeks [ 121 ] . Mature bone formation was observed with evidence of active remodelling , along with a dense vascular network [ 121 ] , demonstrating the potential for this model to be used for creation of vascularized transplantable bone . Space maintainers can be used in conjunction with these strate - gies to preserve and enhance a defect site while the bone graft is grown at an ectopic location [ 122 , 123 ] . In a rabbit composite man - dibular defect model , porous PMMA space maintainers inserted at the defect site exhibited enhanced soft tissue healing and implant cover - age over solid implants [ 122 ] . The space maintainer preserves the soft tissue envelope surrounding the defect , acts as a template for soft tissue regrowth , and prevents scarring at the defect site [ 123 , 124 ] . These implants could also be coupled with antibiotics or soluble factors to further improve defect healing and minimize risk of infec - tion [ 123 ] . Surgical solutions for vascularized bone tissue engineering may help to enable the translation of basic research strategies into the generation of large bone volumes . However , these techniques have not been exploited signiﬁcantly in the ﬁeld of tissue engineering . In some cases , these techniques utilize autologous cells and proteins without extensive in vitro culture . Two - step surgical procedures may be the required strategies for further translational clinical applications , however , these strategies introduce additional risks and hospitaliza - tion costs .

Conclusion Many recent advances have been made towards engineering vascular - ized bone . The widespread utilization of autologous , clinically avail - able cells is encouraging for the clinical translation of these methods . Additional insight into the complex interactions between osteogenic and ECs may lead to future success in cell - based strategies . Another major hurdle in developing tissue engineered vascularized bone grafts is scaling up to the appropriate volume . Many of the strategies dis - cussed here result in small volumes of tissue on the order of millime - tres , whereas defects are often on the centimetre scale . Surgical strategies are able to create larger volumes , but often require multiple surgeries or surgical sites , increasing risk of infection and other complications . Bioreactor - based approaches are designed to result in larger volumes , but high costs and long culture times could hinder their clinical implementation . The ultimate clinical success of tissue engineered vascularized bone requires novel strategies to overcome these challenges .
