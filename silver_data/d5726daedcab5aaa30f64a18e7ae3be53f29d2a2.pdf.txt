However , empiric data on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) among children and in educational settings are scarce . In Australia , most schools have remained open during the first epidemic wave , albeit with reduced student physical attendance at the epidemic peak . We examined SARS - CoV - 2 transmission among children and staff in schools and early childhood education and care ( ECEC ) settings in the Australian state of New South Wales ( NSW ) . Methods Laboratory - confirmed paediatric ( aged ≤18 years ) and adult COVID - 19 cases who attended a school or ECEC setting while considered infectious ( defined as 24 h before symptom onset based on national guidelines during the study period ) in NSW from Jan 25 to April 10 , 2020 , were investigated for onward transmission . All identified school and ECEC settings close contacts were required to home quarantine for 14 days , and were monitored and offered SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid testing if symptomatic . Enhanced investigations in selected educational settings included nucleic acid testing and SARS - CoV - 2 antibody testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts . Secondary attack rates were calculated and compared with state - wide COVID - 19 rates . Findings 15 schools and ten ECEC settings had children ( n = 12 ) or adults ( n = 15 ) attend while infectious , with 1448 contacts monitored . Of these , 633 ( 43·7 % ) of 1448 had nucleic acid testing , or antibody testing , or both , with 18 secondary cases identified ( attack rate 1·2 % ) . Five secondary cases ( three children ; two adults ) were identified ( attack rate 0·5 % ; 5 / 914 ) in three schools . No secondary transmission occurred in nine of ten ECEC settings among 497 contacts . However , one outbreak in an ECEC setting involved transmission to six adults and seven children ( attack rate 35·1 % ; 13 / 37 ) . Across all settings , five ( 28·0 % ) of 18 secondary infections were asymptomatic ( three infants [ all aged 1 year ] , one adolescent [ age 15 years ] , and one adult ) . Interpretation SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rates were low in NSW educational settings during the first COVID - 19 epidemic wave , consistent with mild infrequent disease in the 1·8 million child population . With effective case - contact testing and epidemic management strategies and associated small numbers of attendances while infected , children and teachers did not contribute significantly to COVID - 19 transmission via attendance in educational settings . These findings could be used to inform modelling and public health policy regarding school closures during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Funding NSW Government Department of Health .

Introduction The global COVID - 19 pandemic has been addressed through implementation of aggressive public health meas ures focused on restricting mobility and ensuring physical distancing . Most countries have enforced school closures to mitigate transmission . 1 However , evidence suggests that COVID - 19 is less prevalent in children and generally causes milder illness , when compared with adults . 2 – 6 The extent to which children are asym p - tomatically infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , and what role they have in virus trans mission , particularly in schools , remains unclear . It appears children are less likely to be the primary infection source in household clusters , compared with adults . 7 , 8 School closures might be effective in controlling pan - demic influenza because children are important in transmission , and have high hospitalisation rates and severe outcomes from influenza . 9 , 10 However , school closures have significant social and economic impacts on children and families , with widespread implications for national and global economies . 11 Although past experiences of school closures might inform expectations of social and economic impacts , modelled effects of school closures have varied depending on the assumptions regarding children’s role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . 12 In China , schools were already closed for school holidays and remained so for a number of months , 13 and , to date , data on COVID - 19 from school or childcare settings are scarce . 14 – 16 Australian strategies to delay and reduce the impact of COVID - 19 following the first case in a traveller from Wuhan , China , on Jan 25 , 2020 , included thorough incoming traveller and community surveil lance , high Articles 2 www . thelancet . com / child - adolescent Published online August 3 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2352 - 4642 ( 20 ) 30251 - 0 testing rates , rapid case isolation and contact tracing , and border closures and quarantine . 17 Major changes in popu - lation behaviour and a low infection rate have ensued . 17 Consistent with national policy , most of Australia’s eight states and territories , including the most populous state New South Wales ( NSW ) , kept schools open during the pandemic . 18 In NSW , guidance for physical distancing , hygiene measures , and educational facility cleaning was issued . At the epidemic peak on March 23 , 2020 , distance ( online ) learning was implemented , and physical atten - dance recommended to be limited to children who needed to attend in person ( eg , children of health - care workers or those without other care options ) . 18 Early childhood education and care ( ECEC ) settings for children aged 6 weeks to 5 years remained open . This study aimed to prospectively examine SARS - CoV - 2 transmission among children and adults in educational settings and to provide real - time evidence for decision making on school - based policies related to COVID - 19 . We secondarily aimed to examine the rate and charac - teristics of NSW paediatric COVID - 19 cases in both educational settings and the wider population . Methods Study setting This study was done in NSW , Australia , population 8·1 million , of which 1·8 million residents ( 23·0 % ) are aged 18 years or younger . 19 Among laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases in NSW , we identified all children ( aged ≤18 years ) and staff who attended school or ECEC settings while considered infectious ( defined as 24 h before symptom onset based on national guidelines during the study period 20 ) . All NSW schools ( n = 3103 ; public , independent , and Catholic ) providing either primary ( ages approxi mately 5 – 12 years ) , or secondary school education ( ages approxi mately 13 – 18 years ) , or both , and any ECEC setting ( approxi - mately n = 4600 ; ages approximately 6 weeks to 5 years ) were eligible for inclusion . The estimated numbers of school staff and enrolled students state wide for 2020 were 143 084 and 1 232 367 , respect ively . Estimates of numbers of ECEC setting staffing and enrolment were not available . The study period for index case identification was from Jan 25 ( first NSW COVID - 19 case notification ) to April 9 , 2020 ( when the 10 - week school term 1 ended and scheduled holidays commenced ) . From March 22 , 2020 , children were encouraged to stay home for distance learning until term 1 end ; however , schools remained open if home schooling was not an option . The follow - up period for close contacts of COVID - 19 cases extended to May 1 , 2020 . The study was commissioned by the NSW Department of Health under the Public Health Act 2010 ( NSW ) and Research in context Evidence before this study Data on COVID - 19 in schools are scarce , particularly given many schools have been closed in response to the pandemic . We searched PubMed and medRxiv on June 5 , 2020 , for studies published from Jan 1 , 2020 , reporting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) in educational settings since the start of the outbreak in China , using the search terms COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , transmission , schools , and children , as well as manually searching the references used in other relevant papers . Terms were searched individually and in combination as necessary , and no language restrictions were used . We identified some studies that included mention of student cases as part of a larger outbreak . We identified one article that detailed transmission in a school setting in Ireland in children aged 10 years and older ; however , this study had few participants , a short study period ( 10 days ) , no data on testing rates , or serological testing in follow - up . Added value of this study We examined SARS - CoV - 2 transmission among children and adults in 25 educational settings ( primary and secondary schools , and early childhood education and care settings ) together with the rate and characteristics of all paediatric COVID - 19 cases in the Australian state of New South Wales over a 3 - month period . We found a low incidence of attendance of children and staff members with COVID - 19 at educational facilities , and low rates of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the 15 schools and childcare settings where a case occurred . The exception was an outbreak in a childcare centre . The use of enhanced surveillance and serological testing of close contacts within the educational setting enabled detection of a small number of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 secondary infections in schools and the childcare setting . Implications of all the available evidence This is the first comprehensive population - based assessment of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission among children and adults in educational facilities . Our results show that where effective case - contact testing and epidemic control strategies exist for the population , children and teachers did not contribute significantly to COVID - 19 transmission via attendance in educational settings . This study will assist modellers , policy makers , health - care providers , and the public to understand the risk of COVID - 19 occurring in educational facilities and help in decision making around school closures and reopenings . Our data also provide insights that can assist in comparing the economic and community costs of school closures against the potential benefits of reduced virus transmission .

Population - level data All laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases in NSW , using SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid testing , 20 were recorded and monitored daily using the NSW Notifiable Conditions Information Management System . All cases ( or their parent or carers ) were interviewed at diagnosis to deter - mine links to known COVID - 19 cases , ascertain move - ments , and identify close contacts while infectious , includ ing at educational facilities . Descriptive data for all laboratory - confirmed cases with onset from Jan 13 to May 1 , 2020 , were analysed . School and ECEC setting case and close contact definitions and management A COVID - 19 school or ECECs index case was defined as the first identified laboratory - confirmed case who attended the facility while infectious . A school or ECEC setting primary case was defined as the initial infectious case or cases in that setting , and might or might not have been the index case . A secondary case was defined as a close contact with SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( detected through nucleic acid testing or serologi cal testing , or both ) , which was considered likely to have occurred via transmission in that educational setting ( based on no other epidemiological link or risk factor ) . Data on all cases’ potential sources of infection and close contacts were obtained from interviews with cases , families , and school officials , and review of school time tables . Close contacts were defined as children or staff with face - to - face contact for at least 15 min , or who shared a closed indoor space for at least 40 min ( generally the same class or lesson , typically consisting of 20 – 30 students ) with a case during their infectious period . All close contacts quarantined at home for 14 days , had regular text message or telephone call contact to enquire about symptoms , and were instructed to be tested if they developed COVID - 19 - related symptoms at designated Figure : Onset date of total ( A ) and paediatric ( B ) confirmed COVID - 19 cases in NSW , Jan 13 – May 1 , 2020 , relative to control measures and school attendance Nucleic acid testing used for confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection , and definition of COVID - 19 case .

Schools and ECEC settings closed temporarily on case notification and gener ally reopened within 24 – 48 h after environmental cleaning and public health measures were instituted . We reviewed data for all close contacts for a minimum of 30 days from last exposure to the primary case , to ensure that any potential new cases were identified and investigated . Targeted enhanced school and ECEC setting - based investigations Selected educational settings were offered participation in enhanced investigations , in addition to routine public health management if logistically feasible and authoris - ation was provided by local public health and education authorities . Close contacts or their parents or carers were provided with information on enhanced investigations and informed consent was obtained ( appendix ) . Partici - pants could opt out at any time . Enhanced investigations of close contacts included a survey requesting more details on extent of contact with the case , and symptoms before and during quarantine ; upper respiratory tract ( nasopharyngeal ) swab for nucleic acid testing 5 – 10 days after last case contact if not previously collected and irrespective of symptoms ; and serological testing after day 21 following last case contact . Swabs were collected at home either by visiting health - care workers , or by the case or parent or carer using written and video instructions . Blood was collected at home visits , dedicated school - based collection days , or pathology collection centres . Laboratory testing Ten public and three private NSW laboratories were validated and did SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid testing during the study period . Blood and nasopharyngeal specimens for enhanced surveillance were tested by the NSW Pathology reference laboratory , the Institute for Clinical Pathology and Medical Research . Nucleic acid testing was done using an in - house real - time PCR as previously described . 21 SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG , IgA , and IgM detection was done using an indirect immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) that has a sensitivity compared with nucleic acid testing of detecting any of SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG , IgA , or IgM when samples were collected at least 14 days after illness onset of 91·3 % ( 95 % CI 84·9 – 95·6 ) and specifi city of 98·9 % ( 95 % CI 98·4 – 99·3 % ; MVNO , personal communication ) . Data analyses Percentages were calculated to describe demographic , laboratory , and epidemiological characteristics of all NSW cases , school or ECEC setting cases , and close contacts . Attack rates were calculated for different transmission scenarios and with denominators including all close contacts or only close contacts who were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . School attendance data were obtained from the NSW Department of Education .

Results As of May 1 , 2020 , NSW had 3033 confirmed COVID - 19 cases , representing 37·5 cases per 100 000 population and 44·8 % of 6777 cases nationally ( figure ) . In NSW , 1760 ( 58·0 % ) of 3033 cases were acquired overseas and 54 ( 1·8 % ) of 3033 cases were acquired interstate . Of 1220 locally acquired cases , 416 ( 34·1 % ) had an unknown source or were under investigation . Children aged 18 years or younger accounted for 97 ( 3·2 % ) of 3033 cases in NSW . 9 % ( n = 9 ) of children with COVID - 19 were admitted to hospital ( most for isolation purposes only ) , with one child , aged 18 years , admitted to intensive care ( table 1 ) . Notification of the first COVID - 19 case in an educational setting was on March 5 , 2020 ( figure ) . Among 97 nucleic acid testing - confirmed cases in children to April 9 , 2020 , 19 ( 19·6 % ) attended an educational setting while infectious and were included in the study ( table 1 ; figure ) . Of the other 78 paediatric cases , 44 ( 56·4 % ) were locally acquired from contact with a confirmed case , mostly from their household ( 70·5 % ; table 1 ) . The timing of measures implemented to ensure physical distancing and decrease population movement and school attendance rates are shown in the figure . Rates declined from approximately 90·0 % to 5·0 % after recommenda - tions for distance learning were made on March 23 , 2020 , and immediately before school holidays commenced on April 10 , 2020 . Cases peaked in late March , with primary cases in schools occurring earlier in the outbreak and primary cases in ECEC settings occurring later in the outbreak ( figure ) . There were 27 primary cases identified in 25 schools ( n = 15 ) and ECEC settings ( n = 10 ) ; of 27 cases , 15 ( 55·6 % ) were staff and 12 ( 44·4 % ) were children ( tables 1 , 2 ) . Of the child cases , eight ( median age 15 years ; range 14 – 16 ) were in secondary schools , with one ( age 10 years ) in primary school . Three ECEC setting primary cases were children ( median age 2 years ; range 2 – 3 ) . Staff ( median age 38 years ; range 31 – 50 ) were the primary cases in four ( 40·0 % ) of Symptomatic ( n = 65 ) Asymptomatic ( n = 223 ) Symptoms unknown ( n = 352 ) * Total secondary cases Percentage of contacts tested n NAT Serology Any test n NAT Serology Any test n NAT * Serology Any test Child contacts SS 2 20 0 / 19 1 / 16 ( 6 % ) 1 / 20 ( 5 % ) 90 0 / 51 0 / 52 0 / 74 83 0 / 47 0 / 3 0 / 47 1 73 % SS 6 4 0 / 4 0 / 3 0 / 4 43 0 / 5 1 / 36 ( 3 % ) 1 / 36 ( 3 % ) † 18 0 / 4 0 / 4 0 / 6 1 70 % PS 1 2 1 / 2 ( 50 % ) 1 / 2 ( 50 % ) 1 / 2 ( 50 % ) 18 0 / 18 0 / 13 0 / 18 46 0 / 8 0 / 1 0 / 8 1 42 % PS 2 1 0 / 1 0 / 1 0 / 1 8 0 / 1 0 / 6 0 / 6 34 0 / 4 0 / 8 0 / 12 0 44 % ECEC 1 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 16 0 / 16 0 / 5 0 / 16 0 100 % ECEC 3 21 0 / 18 0 / 4 0 / 20 22 0 / 6 0 / 7 0 / 11 108 0 / 55 0 / 4 0 / 59 0 60 % ECEC 6 7 3 / 6 ( 50 % ) 3 / 6 ( 50 % ) 4 / 7 ( 57 % ) 13 3 / 13 ( 23 % ) 2 / 8 ( 25 % ) 3 / 13 ( 23 % ) 5 0 / 4 0 / 2 0 / 4 7 96 % All 55 4 / 50 ( 8 % ) 5 / 32 ( 16 % ) 6 / 54 ( 11· % ) 194 3 / 94 ( 3 % ) 3 / 122 ( 3 % ) 4 / 158 ( 3 % ) 310 0 / 138 0 / 27 0 / 152 10 65 % Adult contacts SS 2 1 0 / 1 0 / 0 0 / 1 8 0 / 4 0 / 3 0 / 5 9 0 / 7 0 / 2 0 / 7 0 72 % SS 6 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 7 0 / 1 1 / 5 ( 20 % ) 1 / 5 ( 20 % ) 2 0 / 1 0 / 1 0 / 1 1 67 % PS 1 1 1 / 1 ( 100 % ) 0 / 0 1 / 1 ( 100 % ) 5 0 / 3 0 / 4 0 / 5 9 0 / 4 0 / 1 0 / 4 1 67 % PS 2 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 2 0 / 1 0 / 2 0 / 2 0 100 % ECEC 1 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 / 0 0 100 % ECEC 3 2 0 / 2 0 / 1 0 / 2 4 0 / 1 0 / 1 0 / 1 19 0 / 16 0 / 2 0 / 17 0 80 % ECEC 6 6 6 / 6 ( 100 % ) 2 / 2 ( 100 % ) 6 / 6 ( 100 % ) 5 0 / 4 0 / 2 0 / 4 1 0 / 1 0 / 1 0 / 1 6 92 % All 10 7 / 10 ( 70 % ) 2 / 3 ( 67 % ) 7 / 10 ( 70 % ) 29 0 / 13 1 / 15 ( 7 % ) 1 / 20 ( 5 % ) 42 0 / 30 0 / 9 0 / 32 8 77 % Total 65 11 / 60 ( 18 % ) 7 / 35 ( 20 % ) 13 / 64 ( 20 % ) 223 3 / 107 ( 3 % ) 4 / 137 ( 3 % ) 5 / 178 ( 3 % ) 352 0 / 168 0 / 36 0 / 184 18 67 % Data are n / N ( % positive of those contacts tested ) , unless otherwise stated .

Table 3 : Details of secondary cases resulting from COVID - 19 transmission in seven NSW educational settings where enhanced surveillance of symptomatic and asymptomatic close contacts was done Articles www . thelancet . com / child - adolescent Published online August 3 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2352 - 4642 ( 20 ) 30251 - 0 7 ten secondary schools , four ( 80·0 % ) of five primary schools , and seven ( 70·0 % ) of ten ECEC settings . The median time that primary cases attended the setting while infectious was 2 days ( range 1 – 10 ) . Infection was locally acquired for all primary cases , but the source was unknown for many ( 12 [ 44·4 % ] of 27 ) . Where known , a household member was usually the source , especially for children ( table 2 ) . Secondary transmission occurred in four of 25 settings : three schools ( five cases ) , and one ECEC setting that had an outbreak ( table 2 ) . In total , 663 ( 43·7 % ) of 1448 close con tacts were tested by nucleic acid testing or serology , or both ; 18 secondary cases were identified among the total 1448 close contacts ( attack rate 1·2 % ) . Among close child and staff contacts who had laboratory testing done , the attack rate was 2·8 % ( tables 3 , 4 ) . Seven of the 25 educational settings ( four schools ; three ECEC settings ) participated in enhanced investigations ( table 3 ) . Among contacts who completed symptom question naires ( 44·9 % ) , 65 ( 22·6 % ) of 288 developed symptoms consistent with COVID - 19 during the 14 - day quarantine , such as fever , sore throat , cough , or rhinorrhea . In these seven settings , 426 ( 66·6 % ) of 640 close contacts had nucleic acid testing or sero logical testing , or both . Secondary attack rates among symptomatic and asymp - tomatic contacts are shown in table 3 . Five secondary cases occurred in schools : one child in one secondary school ; one child and one staff member in another secondary school ; and one staff member , followed by one child in one primary school ( table 3 ) . This primary school was the only school to have a second - generation infection . Overall , two children were symptomatic and had nucleic acid testing ( one positive on day 6 and the other negative on day 4 after last exposure ) , whereas one child and one staff member were asymptomatic and did not have nucleic acid testing . One symptomatic staff member had nucleic acid testing only ( table 3 ) . The attack rate in the tested population in schools was five ( 1·3 % ) of 375 . No SARS - CoV - 2 transmission occurred in two of the three ECEC settings that participated in enhanced surveillance ( 25 staff and 167 child contacts ) . The third ECEC setting had a large outbreak first recognised via an index case in a child aged 2 years , but subsequently found related to a primary case in one staff member ( infection source unknown ; tables 2 and 3 ) . Overall , six other staff and seven children were infected ( attack rate 35·1 % ) . Among the infected close contacts , three of 13 were infants ( age 1 year ) who remained asymptomatic . The overall child to child transmission rate was 0·3 % , and the attack rate for child to staff member was 1·0 % ( table 4 ) . The rate of staff member to child transmission was lower ( 1·5 % ) than staff to staff transmission ( 4·4 % ) . Excluding the single ECEC setting with the large outbreak , staff member to child ( 0·2 % ) and staff member to staff member ( 0·7 % ) transmission rates were lower compared with all settings . Discussion This study of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools and early childcare settings in a defined population of 8·1 million Australians shows low case rates and secondary infections among children and staff attending educa - tional facilities throughout the first epidemic wave of the COVID - 19 pandemic . School closures during the COVID - 19 pandemic have affected more than 90 % of the world’s student population , 1 and contributed to reduc - ing overall population mobility , including via reduced parent and carer workforce participation . However , the insufficiency of data on age - specific and setting - specific susceptibility and transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 has limited our understanding of what school closure , or reopening , might contribute to COVID - 19 control . 9 , 12 Our data provide multiple insights that need to be viewed in the context of our setting . First , and related to overall epidemic activity in NSW , the reported incidence of an infectious child or staff member attending an educational facility was low , occurring in only 25 of 7700 NSW facilities . Second , despite only 10·0 % of school attendees being staff during the first part of the epidemic , when student attendance was high , overall , primary COVID - 19 cases were staff members in 56·0 % of educational settings ; this is consistent with higher population - based rates of COVID - 19 in adults than children . Third , secondary transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 only occurred in three of 15 schools and one of ten ECEC settings . Only one setting , Secondary attack All settings , all contacts , including single ECEC outbreak 1·2 % ( 18 / 1448 ) All settings , all contacts , excluding single ECEC outbreak * 0·4 % ( 5 / 1411 ) All settings , all child case to child contacts 0·3 % ( 2 / 649 ) All settings , all child case to staff member contacts 1·0 % ( 1 / 103 ) All settings , all staff member case to child contacts 1·5 % ( 8 / 536 ) All settings , all staff member case to staff member contacts 4·4 % ( 7 / 160 ) All settings , all staff member case to child contact , excluding single ECEC outbreak * 0·2 % ( 1 / 511 ) All settings , all staff member case to staff member contacts , excluding single ECEC outbreak * 0·7 % ( 1 / 148 ) All settings , tested population 2·8 % ( 18 / 633 ) All settings , tested population , excluding single ECEC outbreak 0·8 % ( 5 / 598 ) All schools , all contacts 0·5 % ( 5 / 914 ) All schools , tested population 1·3 % ( 5 / 375 ) Single ECEC outbreak , * all contacts 35·1 % ( 13 / 37 ) Child close contacts 28·0 % ( 7 / 25 ) Staff close contacts 50·0 % ( 6 / 12 ) Data are rate % ( n / N ) . SARS - CoV - 2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . ECEC = early childhood education and care . * This outbreak resulted in at least four generations of infection and there was no evidence of child to child or child to staff transmission ( unpublished ) . Table 4 : Secondary attack rates of SARS - CoV - 2 infection by educational setting and testing approach Articles 8 www . thelancet . com / child - adolescent Published online August 3 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2352 - 4642 ( 20 ) 30251 - 0 an ECEC setting , had a sustained outbreak of COVID - 19 following infection in a staff member , which was not apparent until investigation of a child index case . Excluding this single ECEC setting outbreak , the overall attack rate was five ( 0·4 % ) in 1411 , or one in every 282 contacts . Continued operation of schools throughout the moderate first epidemic wave in NSW , albeit with reduced face - to - face attendance in line with public health guidance , did not appear to contribute significantly to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( attack rate 0·5 % ) . Atten dance rates were still high during the period when transmission , in the two secondary and one primary schools , occurred . This finding was in contrast to other settings in NSW , where multiple outbreaks were contem poraneously identi - fied , including aged - care facilities and mass gatherings , such as weddings and religious services . 22 An important component of our study was enhanced follow - up in a subset of educational settings , including in both asymptomatic and symptomatic adult and child contacts . This resulted in laboratory testing in two - thirds of close contacts . The use of serology facilitated identi - fication of four additional secondary cases , including an asymptomatic student and staff member , who were not detected using routinely deployed nucleic acid testing and increased secondary case numbers from that in our preliminary report 23 to the NSW and Australian Government ( n = 2 ) . By comparison , a small study 16 from Ireland of six COVID - 19 cases in three schools , over less than 2 weeks , suggested no transmission to 1115 close contacts . How ever , children aged younger than 10 years and data on testing rates were not included . In our study , the attack rate among the tested population across all schools was low ( 1·3 % ) and was zero in nine of the ten ECEC settings . The single ECEC setting outbreak was complex and occurred early on in the epidemic in NSW . 13 ( 35·1 % ) of 37 contacts in this small centre were infected ; three of the seven infected children ( all aged < 3 years ) remained asymptomatic and the others had mild disease . Trans mission chains between staff and from staff to children were apparent . Child to child or child to staff transmission appeared unlikely to have occurred but could not be excluded . In addition , delayed primary case diagnosis , due to adherence to narrow nucleic acid testing criteria recommended at the time , close mix ing of staff and children and shared physical amenities , probably contributed to the several generations of trans mission ( data not shown ; unpub - lished ) . In summary , our findings add to emerging data 7 , 9 on the direction of transmission from household and similar settings , such as ECEC settings , that suggest children are unlikely to initiate , or propagate , outbreaks . We report a correspondingly low rate of paediatric disease ( 97 cases among 1·8 million aged 18 years or younger ; 5·2 per 100 000 ; 3·2 % of total ) across NSW , providing additional evidence of reduced transmission resulting in clinical disease to and between children . Studies from multiple countries have consistently shown lower rates of COVID - 19 and mild disease in children compared with adults , even in settings with much higher population - based disease rates than Australia . 2 – 5 , 24 Multiple hypotheses are being explored to explain the decreased susceptibility of children to SARS - CoV - 2 , including differ ences in immune responses 25 and age - dependent expres sion of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) virus receptor ; 26 however , the mecha - nisms responsible for this phenomenon remain unclear . The low case and transmission rates in NSW schools and childcare settings reported here were underpinned by rapid and effective state and national public health , and community , responses . 17 Although community - based trans mission occurred in some areas , particularly in Sydney ( based on the proportion of cases [ 34·2 % ] with a local or unknown source of infection despite intensive contact tracing , and an effective repro ductive number above 1 until mid - March , 2020 ) , the NSW epidemic was smaller and of shorter duration compared with that seen in many other countries . 17 , 27 Tracking SARS - CoV - 2 trans - mission was possible in this epidemic context because frequent simultaneous case introductions to schools and ECEC settings were not occurring , and enabled by continued operation of educational facilities throughout the epidemic period , albeit with reduced face - to - face attendance in the weeks before school holidays . Higher SARS - CoV - 2 primary case and transmission rates might have occurred in schools and ECEC settings if the epidemic had escalated or if extensive testing , tracing , quarantine of exposed close contacts , and other public health mitigation measures were not simultaneously and effectively implemented . Although there are no specific data on adherence to these measures by the public in NSW , several strategies were in place to support a high com pliance rate , including for quarantine of close contacts identified in this study . These strategies included regular wellbeing calls by public health staff to facilitate access to essential goods without breaching isolation , and issuing of fines to people found in breach of isolation requirements during random house calls by NSW police . Interpretation of our findings needs to be made in the context of the epidemic characteristics and COVID - 19 response in NSW . Our study is also limited by several factors . First , the majority of close contacts were tested after developing symptoms , so infected contacts with no or mild symp - toms might have been missed . Symptom data were also incomplete and might have been affected by participant recall bias . Additional enhanced surveillance was limited by geographical location and school or ECEC settings’ willingness to participate during a challenging time . Second , trans mission rates reported might have been affected by the sensitivity and specificity of assays ( nucleic acid testing and the IFA for virus - specific anti body ) used for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . When compared with nucleic acid testing for the diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , the IFA is reported to have high sensitivity and specificity in a mixed patient population Articles www . thelancet . com / child - adolescent Published online August 3 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2352 - 4642 ( 20 ) 30251 - 0 9 ( asymptomatic individuals to patients requiring intensive care unit admission ) . We did not attempt transmission rates to adjust for test performance characteristics , given the non - uniform application of diagnostic testing methods in this study . Third , variation in close contact definitions used across settings , declining school attendance rates in the 2 weeks before school holidays , and differing types of contact could not be controlled for and might have influenced attack rates . However , although face - to - face attendance declined rapidly later in the study period in response to public health advice , the number of close contacts monitored ( 1411 ; 1185 children and 263 adults ) was still substantial . The national public health definition of the infectious period for cases was extended from 24 h to 48 h before symptom onset after our study period based on the latest evidence . It is probable that additional close contacts would have been identified in our study had the 48 - h presymptomatic contact definition been operational before the commence ment of our study . Future studies in school settings in Australia or other countries using this criteria for the potential infectious period will build on our findings . Finally , we were unable to assess adherence to or the effect on transmission of recommendations regarding hygiene or physical dis tancing in educational settings , and these progressively increased in magnitude over the study period . The possible benefits of school closures on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission reduction must be considered against the adverse effects on child wellbeing , including the potential to exacerbate inequality . 28 Although this study did not aim to assess the impact of school operation on the NSW epidemic , and it is unlikely that the effect of school closure alone can be disentangled from other broader pandemic control measures , 29 our findings provide evidence that SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in educational settings can be kept low and manageable in the context of an effective epidemic response . These data should inform modelling and decision making regarding planned return of children and teachers to classrooms as pandemic control evolves . Where pandemic mitigation measures result in strong disease control , we anticipate that schools can be open in a safe way , for the educational , social , and economic good of the community as we adapt to living with COVID - 19 .
