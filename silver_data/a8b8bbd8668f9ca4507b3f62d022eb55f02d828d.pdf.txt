There are no widely accepted therapeutics available to prevent or treat the disease . CCHFV enters host cells through clathrin - mediated endocytosis and is subsequently transported to an acidified compartment where the fusion of virus envelope with cellular membranes takes place . To better understand the uptake pathway , we sought to identify host factors controlling CCHFV transport through the cell . We demonstrate that after passing through early endosomes in a Rab5 - dependent manner , CCHFV is delivered to multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . Virus particles localized to MVBs approximately 1 hour after infection and affected the distribution of the organelle within cells . Interestingly , blocking Rab7 activity had no effect on association of the virus with MVBs . Productive virus infection depended on phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) activity , which meditates the formation of functional MVBs . Silencing Tsg101 , Vps24 , Vps4B , or Alix / Aip1 , components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) pathway controlling MVB biogenesis , inhibited infection of wild - type virus as well as a novel pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) bearing CCHFV glycoprotein , supporting a role for the MVB pathway in CCHFV entry . We further demonstrate that blocking transport out of MVBs still allowed virus entry while preventing vesicular acidification , required for membrane fusion , trapped virions in the MVBs . These findings suggest that MVBs are necessary for infection and are the sites of virus - endosome membrane fusion .

The virus is endemic to much of Eastern Europe , the Middle East , Asia , and Africa , although recent studies have detected CCHFV in ticks collected in Spain , indicating an expanding geographic distribu - tion [ 1 – 4 ] . Despite the high mortality and global distribution of CCHFV , there are presently no licensed therapeutics to prevent or treat the disease . CCHFV belongs to the family Bunyaviridae . It is an enveloped , pleomorphic virus , possessing a tripartite single - stranded RNA genome in negative orientation . The small segment , S , encodes the nucleocapsid protein N , whose role is to encapsidate viral RNA during transcription and genome replication . The large segment , L , encodes the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase , which associ - ates with N to form the viral polymerase complex [ 5 ] . The medium segment , M , contains the gene for the viral glycoprotein polyprotein , which is co - translationally cleaved and post - transla - tionally modified to generate two structural transmembrane proteins , Gc and Gn , and non - structural proteins GP38 and NSm [ 5 – 9 ] . The Gc and Gn form complexes on the virion surface and are responsible for binding to the cellular receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral envelope with host membranes [ 10 , 11 ] . Virus entry into the cell is the first and critical step in the virus replication cycle . The host receptor of CCHFV has not been identified , although a recent study has suggested that nucleolin plays a necessary role in virus entry and that Gc is essential for binding to the cell [ 12 ] . Virus uptake occurs through clathrin - dependent endocytosis and requires cholesterol and low pH to productively infect host cells [ 13 , 14 ] . An earlier study implicated Rab5 , a small GTPase critical for vesicular transport from the plasma membrane to early endosomes , as important for infection [ 13 ] . The lack of the involvement of Rab7 , which controls PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 1 September 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 9 | e1004390 vesicular trafficking to late endosomes , in infection and the requirement for pH 6 . 0 to inactivate the virus led to speculation that virus fusion with host membranes takes place at early endosomes [ 13 ] , although direct localization of virus to the early endosomes was not demonstrated . Little else is known about trafficking of the virus along the endocytic route or the identity of cellular compartments where the fusion of the viral and host membranes takes place . Here , we investigated the mechanism of transport of CCHFV through the host cell in more detail . Results CCHFV traffics through early endosomes in a Rab5 - dependent manner CCHFV enters cells by clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 13 , 14 ] . The virus was also previously shown to require Rab5 during infection of cells [ 13 ] , suggesting a requirement for trafficking through early endosomes . However , localization of the virus to early endosomes has not been demonstrated , and so we examined uptake and trafficking kinetics of virus particles in more detail . Human adenocarcinoma cell line , SW13 , has been demonstrated to support CCHFV replication [ 15 ] and , therefore , was utilized in our study . SW13 cells were incubated with CCHFV for up to 120 min and then stained with antibodies to virus nucleoprotein N and early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) , which localizes exclusively to early endosomes [ 16 ] . CCHFV is known to enter cells within 90 min [ 14 ] , and therefore the N protein signal was likely to represent incoming virions . We observed that virus localized to early endosomes as early as 15 min and reached steady state by 30 min , with approximately 10 % of the virions being EEA1 - associated ( Fig . 1A ) . Our results directly confirm that CCHFV is trafficked through early endosomes during infection . To test whether Rab5A facilitates CCHFV movement to early endosomes , we expressed a fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) and the dominant negative form of the Rab5A containing a substitution of serine to asparagine at position 34 ( DN Rab5A ) in SW13 cells and then infected the cells with wild - type virus . The control included cells expressing eGFP . The DN Rab5A arrests transport of vesicles from the cell surface due to a block in maturation of early endosomes [ 17 , 18 ] and , therefore , we expected to observe accumulation of virions near the cell surface . Indeed , cells expressing the DN , but not eGFP , showed virions localized close to the plasma membrane , in EEA1 - positive structures ( Fig . 1B ) . This finding confirms that CCHFV is transported in a Rab5A - dependent manner . While expression of DN Rab5A inhibits formation of early endosomes , expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rab5A containing a substitution of glutamine to leucine at position 79 ( CA Rab5A ) enhances the formation of the endosomes , making the vesicles appear drastically enlarged , but also compromises maturation of and cargo transport to later endosomal compart - ments [ 19 – 22 ] . To determine whether CCHFV entry involves passage through endosomal compartments downstream of early endosomes , SW13 cells expressing a fusion of eGFP and CA Rab5A or eGFP alone as a control were infected with CCHFV for 24 h to allow virus to establish replication sites [ 13 , 14 ] . The N distribution in eGFP - expressing cells was similar to that seen in untransfected cells and likely represented pools of newly expressed protein due to virus gene expression and genome replication . In contrast , in CA - expressing cells , N staining was limited and likely represented incoming virus trapped in endosomes , consistent with that described in the above figures ( Fig . 1C , left and middle panels ) . The percentages of eGFP - expressing cells that were infected with CCHFV were found to be 47 % and 1 % in control eGFP - and CA - expressing cells , respectively ( Fig . 1C , right panel ) . These data demonstrate that productive infection by CCHFV requires trafficking through early endosomes as well as down - stream endosomal compartments . CCHFV localizes to MVBs during infection Over time , cellular cargo from early endosomes can become concentrated on intraluminal vesicles within vacuolar domains , generating multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) [ 23 , 24 ] . Several viruses traffic through the MVB and depend on its sorting machinery during early steps in infection , including influenza A virus , vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , Lassa fever virus ( LASV ) , and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) [ 25 – 28 ] . To test whether CCHFV localizes to MVBs during entry , we incubated SW13 cells with virus for up to 120 min and then stained them for N and tetraspanin protein CD63 , which is enriched in MVBs [ 29 ] . As shown in Fig . 2A , virus localized to CD63 - positive structures , presumably MVBs , starting at 60 min post - infection . This association appeared to accelerate over time until a major redistribution of the organelle occurred within the cell ( Fig . 2A ) . CD63 is also known to contain a putative lysosomal targeting signal and to colocalize with late endosomal / lysosomal - associated membrane proteins Lamp1 and Lamp2 [ 30 ] , suggesting that a fraction of this protein is in late endosomes and lysosomes . To address the question whether CCHFV localizes to these endosomal compartments during infection , we infected cells with CCHFV for 120 min and then stained them with antibodies detecting either ( i ) N and ALG - 2 - interacting protein X / apoptosis - linked - gene - 2 - interacting protein 1 ( Alix / Aip1 ) , which associates with MVBs to coordinate vesicle formation and biogenesis [ 31 ] ; or ( ii ) N and Lamp1 . As shown in Fig . 2B , 35 % of CCHFV particles localized with Alix / Aip1 , while only 3 % of virions were found in Lamp1 - positive endosomes . While it is possible that the Lamp1 - positive endosomes represent late endosomes or lysosomes , the relevance of the association to virus infection mechanism is questionable since Rab7 , which controls vesicular transport out of MVBs [ 32 ] , does not play a role in CCHFV infection [ 13 ] . Thus , our findings demonstrate that virus is transported through MVBs during early stages of infection . Several studies have reported that Rab7 controls cargo move - ment out of early endosomes [ 33 , 34 ] , while others indicate the function of this Rab later in the endocytic pathway , from MVBs to lysosomes [ 32 ] . To test whether Rab7A has a role in virus transport to MVBs in SW13 cells , we overexpressed the DN form of Rab7A , containing a substitution of threonine to asparagine at position 22 [ 35 ] , in cells , challenged them with virus , and then tested for localization of virus to CD63 - positive compartments . As a control , we transfected cells with a plasmid expressing eGFP alone . The Author Summary Crimean - Congo hemorrhagic fever virus ( CCHFV ) is the cause of a severe , often fatal disease in humans . While it has been demonstrated that CCHFV cell entry depends on clathrin - mediated endocytosis , low pH , and early endo - somes , the identity of the endosomes where virus penetrates into cell cytoplasm to initiate genome replica - tion is unknown . Here , we showed that CCHFV was transported through early endosomes to multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . We also showed that MVBs were likely the last organelle virus encountered before escaping into the cytoplasm . Our work has identified new cellular factors essential for CCHFV entry and potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention against this pathogen . MVB Is Required for CCHFV Cell Entry PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 2 September 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 9 | e1004390 MVB Is Required for CCHFV Cell Entry PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 3 September 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 9 | e1004390 overexpression of the DN or eGFP had no effect on localization of the virus to the MVBs ( Fig . 2C ) , suggesting that Rab7A does not control virus transport between early endosomes and MVBs . Because Rab7 was shown as not important for CCHFV infection [ 13 ] , our findings also indicate that CCHFV might not traffic beyond MVBs . CCHFV infection requires phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) activity According to our data , CCHFV colocalizes with and redistrib - utes MVBs during early stages of infection . It is unclear , however , whether there is a functional significance of this association . To study CCHFV infection in more detail , we generated CCHFV that incorporated a minigenome segment encoding the red fluorescent protein mKate2 ( CCHFV - mKate2 ) . BsrT7 / 5 cells [ 36 ] were transfected with the minigenome construct and plasmids expressing viral N and polymerase and then mock - infected or infected with wild - type CCHFV . The recombinant virus was collected 48 h after infection and inoculated onto fresh SW13 cells to assess packaging of the minigenome . As seen in Fig . 3A , inoculation of the supernatant from the cells infected with the virus resulted in the expression of the mKate2 gene in the cells , demonstrating the generation of recombinant CCHFV - mKate2 . Without superinfection , no mKate2 signal was seen ( Fig . 3A ) . To verify that CCHFV - mKate2 infection is comparable to the wild - type CCHFV , we tested a range of pharmacological inhibitors . Since CCHFV infection has been shown to depend on clathrin - dependent endocytosis , cholesterol , and low pH [ 13 , 14 ] , we used the following reagents : ( i ) bafilomycin A , a specific inhibitor of vacuolar - type H + - ATPase [ 37 ] ; ( ii ) 5 - ( N - Ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amil - oride ( EIPA ) , an inhibitor of the Na + / H + exchanger that specifically blocks macropinocytosis [ 38 ] ; ( iii ) nystatin , which sequesters cholesterol in the plasma membrane [ 39 ] ; ( iv ) dynasore , a specific inhibitor of dynamin , which is essential for the formation of clathrin - coated and caveolae vesicles [ 40 ] ; and ( v ) chlorprom - azine hydrochloride ( CPZ ) , a specific inhibitor of clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 41 ] . Similar to wild - type virus , CCHFV - mKate2 required low pH , free cholesterol , and the formation of clathrin - coated pits to infect host cells ( Fig . 3A , right panel ) . MVB formation requires class III PI3K activity , which directs synthesis of the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) [ 25 , 42 , 43 ] . The requirement for PI3K in CCHFV infection was examined using the drug LY294002 , a potent and specific inhibitor of this enzyme [ 43 , 44 ] . As shown in Fig . 3B , treatment of the cells with the inhibitor blocked CCHFV - mKate2 infection by approximately 80 % , supporting a possible functional role for MVBs in CCHFV infection . Endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) regulators control CCHFV infection MVB biogenesis critically depends on a group of class E vacuolar protein sorting ( Vps ) regulators , which form three large hetero - oligomeric complexes within the ESCRT pathway and are designated ESCRT - I , II , and III . The cargo , which is initially selected in early endosomes , is passed on to ESCRT - I on MVB membranes , where tumor susceptibility gene 101 ( Tsg101 ) protein plays a central role in recognizing the cargo and activating ESCRT - II and subsequently ESCRT - III complexes [ 45 ] . ESCRT - associated ATPases Vps4A and B are important in the later stages of the MVB pathway by catalyzing disassembly of ESCRT - III complex , a step critical for sorting cargo into intraluminal vesicles within MVBs [ 46 ] . Alix / Aip1 interacts with Tsg101 and components of ESCRT - III complex and , as indicated above , directly modulates the formation of intraluminal vesicles , giving rise to MVBs [ 31 ] . To further investigate whether MVB biogenesis is critical for CCHFV infection , we tested the effect of depleting cellular Tsg101 , Vps24 ( ESCRT - III component ) , Vps4B , and Alix / Aip1 ( Fig . 4C ) on efficiency of CCHFV - mKate2 infection . Treatment of cells with siRNAs specific to these ESCRT regulators , but not with a non - targeting siRNA , blocked infection by . 60 % , with Alix / Aip1 siRNAs being the most potent ( Figs . 4A – B ) . These data demonstrate that the MVB / ESCRT pathway controls CCHFV infection . ESCRT regulators control CCHFV entry Our results indicate that CCHFV is transported through MVBs and that productive virus infection requires MVB biogenesis . However , it is unclear what step of the viral lifecycle is regulated by the MVB pathway ; it could be entry and / or viral gene expression and genome replication . Pseudotyped virus particles have become a valuable tool for analysis of entry mechanism of numerous viruses . However , to date , no pseudotype system has been described for CCHFV . To generate VSV pseudotyped with CCHFV glycoproteins ( VSV - CCHFVG ) , we expressed CCHFV glycoprotein precursor G or b - galactosidase ( control ) in 293FT cells and then inoculated the cells with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus glycoprotein ( VEEV GP ) pseudotyped VSV stock encoding a firefly luciferase reporter gene ( VSV - VEEVGP ) . VSV - VEEVGP was used because of its ability to grow to high titers and because residual VEEV GP is short - lived in target cells ( our unpublished data ) . As VSV core is replicated and new viral particles are assembled , the overexpressed CCHFV glycoproteins would become incorporated into nascent virions . b - galactosidase - expressing cells served as an indicator of VSV - VEEVGP carryover in the media of the inoculated cells since no viral glycoprotein was expressed there . The pseudotyped virus was collected 48 h after addition of VSV - VEEVGP and added to monolayers of SW13 cells to assess titers by measuring luciferase activity . The intensity of luminescence in cells incubated with VSV - CCHFVG was typically 8 times higher than in cells incubated with the control supernatant ( Fig . 5A ) . Since Gc is crucial for CCHFV binding to the cell [ 12 ] , we performed a neutralization test using a polyclonal anti - Gc antibody to assess whether functional CCHFV glycoprotein Figure 1 . CCHFV traffics through early endosomes in a Rab5 - dependent manner . ( A ) SW13 cells were incubated with CCHFV for indicated times . Then , the cells were fixed , permeabilized , and treated with CellMask blue dye ( grey ) to stain the cytoplasm and nucleus , anti - N antibody ( virus , red ) , and anti - EEA1 antibody ( early endosomes , green ) . Images were obtained as Z - stacks , and three - dimensional ( 3D ) images of cells were generated to assess colocalization between virus and endosomes . The percentages of virus particles localizing to early endosomes were counted in 20 cells in each sample , and averages and standard deviations are shown .

Images were obtained and MVB Is Required for CCHFV Cell Entry PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 5 September 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 9 | e1004390 complexes were present on the pseudovirion surface . VSV - CCHFVG or VSV - VEEVGP was incubated with the antibody , and the pseudotype - antibody mixtures were transferred onto SW13 cells . Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later . The antibody treatment inhibited VSV - CCHFVG , but not VSV - VEEVGP infection in a dose - dependent manner , indicating that the pseudovirus entry was glycoprotein - mediated ( Fig . 5B ) . CCHFV infection is pH - dependent , requiring endosomal acidification during entry ( [ 13 , 14 ] and Fig . 2A ) . To test pH dependency of VSV - CCHFVG , SW13 cells treated with DMSO or bafilomycin A were challenged with the pseudotyped virus . As seen in Fig . 5C , bafilomycin A treatment inhibited infection by . 98 % , demonstrating that , similarly to wild - type CCHFV , the pseudotyped virus requires acidic environment for infection and confirming that glycoprotein activation depends on low pH . We next used VSV - CCHFVG to verify whether the MVB pathway had a role in CCHFV entry . SW13 cells depleted of cellular Tsg101 , Vps24 , Vps4B , or Alix / Aip1 ( Fig . 4C ) were incubated with VSV - CCHFVG . A recent study reporting the involvement of ESCRT regulators in arenavirus entry excluded the possibility that these ESCRT - specific siRNA treatments affected cytoplasmic transport or replication of the VSV core [ 25 ] . As seen in Fig . 5D , silencing ESCRT regulators significantly inhibited VSV - CCHFVG infection , suggesting that the MVB / ESCRT pathway is crucial for CCHFV entry . Lipid transport out of MVBs is dispensable for CCHFV entry According to our results , CCHFV is transported through MVBs and requires ESCRT regulators during entry . The drug U18666A inhibits lipid transport from MVB / late endosomal compartments [ 47 , 48 ] and disrupts the trafficking of MVB - associated membrane proteins [ 48 – 50 ] . To test whether virus needs to traffic beyond MVBs , mock - treated cells or cells treated with U18666A were challenged with wild - type CCHFV for 24 h and then stained with anti - N antibody to assess infection and with anti - CD63 antibody to examine MVB morphology . We found that U18666A had no effect on virus infection as the expression level and the intracellular distribution of N or infection efficiency ( approximately 4 % ) were similar to those in mock - treated cells ( Fig . 6A ) . The N distribution was consistent with previously reported data [ 51 ] , appearing as aggregates of various sizes close to the cell nucleus . These did not colocalize with the MVB marker CD63 , despite an increase in size and number of CD63 puncta ( Fig . 6A ) , likely due to the block of sphingolipid and cholesterol traffic out of the organelle [ 47 – 50 ] . Indeed , in agreement with previous reports [ 50 , 52 ] , we observed an accumulation of cholesterol in MVBs in cells treated with U18666A , but not in mock - treated cells , by staining with the cholesterol - binding compound filipin III ( Fig . 6B ) . We next examined whether U18666A treatment affected virus entry . Mock - treated cells or cells treated with U18666A were incubated with VSV - CCHFVG . Controls were pseudotyped viruses containing either Ebolavirus ( EBOV ) or LASV glycopro - tein ( VSV - EBOVGP and VSV - LASVGP , respectively ) . EBOV entry depends on the cholesterol transporter protein Niemann - Pick C1 and therefore is sensitive to U18666A treatment [ 53 , 54 ] . LASV passes through MVBs during entry to fuse with late endosomal membranes where Lamp1 serves as a fusion receptor [ 25 , 55 ] . We found that the inhibitor had no effect on VSV - CCHFVG infection , while infections of VSV - EBOVGP and VSV - LASVGP were blocked by . 98 % and . 85 % , respectively ( Fig . 6C ) , suggesting that lipid traffic out of MVBs is not required for CCHFV entry . These data and findings that Rab7 does not play a role in CCHFV infection [ 13 ] or localization to MVBs ( Fig . 2C ) demonstrate that virus does not require trafficking beyond MVBs during entry . Bafilomycin A treatment results in accumulation of CCHFV in MVBs Our results indicate that MVBs might represent the last endocytic compartment before CCHFV escape into the cytoplasm for replication ( Figs . 2C and 6 ) . In Fig . 3A and work by others [ 13 , 14 ] , the virus also requires an acidic environment to establish productive infection . Therefore , blocking endosomal acidification should trap virus in vesicles prior to sites of membrane fusion . Cells treated with bafilomycin A or DMSO were incubated with wild - type virus for 24 h . We then assessed the intracellular distribution of viral N protein and N - MVB colocalization . According to both Simon et al . [ 14 ] and our findings ( Fig . 5C ) , inhibition of vesicular acidification for 24 h blocked virus entry . We observed that , while DMSO treatment did not affect virus infection , treatment with bafilomycin A resulted in accumulation of N , presumably virions , within MVBs ( Fig . 7A , top and middle panels ) . The amounts of N found in MVBs were 4 % in DMS0 - treated cells and 67 % in bafilomycin A - treated cells ( Fig . 7A , lower left panel ) . Next , we determined whether virus genome replication took place in MVBs . Cells treated with DMSO in duplicate or bafilomycin A were inoculated with CCHFV . We then isolated RNA from one set of DMSO - treated cells 2 h later and from the other two samples 24 h after virus addition . The RNA was used to determine virus genome copies present , where the sample collected from the first set of DMSO - treated cells served as a control , since virus genome replication is not detectable 2 h after incubating cells with virus [ 14 ] . As seen in Fig . 7B , no significant difference in the genome copy number was observed between the control sample and the bafilomycin A - treated sample . In contrast , the second set of DMSO - treated cells exhibited a 6 - log increase in genome equivalents , demonstrating that bafilomycin A treatment blocks CCHFV replication . To test whether virus replication was a requirement for virus localization to MVBs , we repeated the experiment identical to that described in Fig . 7A but used CCHFV that was inactivated by gamma - irradiation . We observed that approximately 40 % of virions associated with MVBs in cells that were treated with either DMSO or bafilomycin A ( Fig . 7C ) , demonstrating that CCHFV association with MVBs is indepen - dent of genome replication . Altogether , our findings suggest that CCHFV membrane fusion or capsid penetration into the cell cytoplasm likely occurs from MVB compartments . Discussion Entry into host cells is the first committal step in any virus replication cycle . In this study , we characterized the entry route taken by CCHFV after internalization from the plasma membrane . analyzed as described in Figure 1A . Examples of N - Alix / Aip1 colocalization ( yellow ) are indicated with arrowheads . Colocalization was quantified by counting the number of N puncta overlapping with Alix / Aip1 or Lamp1 staining ( right panel ) . ( C ) SW13 cells were transfected with either pLenti - eGFP or pRab7A - DN . Twenty - four h later , cells were incubated with CCHFV for 120 min , then fixed and stained with anti - N antibody ( red ) , anti - CD63 antibody ( green ) , and CellMask blue dye ( grey ) . eGFP - expressing cells are pseudocolored white ( right panel of each pair ) . Images were generated and analyzed as described in Figure 1A . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1004390 . g002 MVB Is Required for CCHFV Cell Entry PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 6 September 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 9 | e1004390 We confirmed previous work that the virus was transported through early endosomes in a Rab5A - dependent manner , but additionally showed that MVBs play an important role in productive infection . Virions localized to and reorganized the intracellular distribution of MVBs , and ESCRT pathway - related proteins involved in MVB formation and function were needed for entry . We also determined that endocytic trafficking out of MVBs did not affect CCHFV infection and that blocking endosome acidification resulted in accumulation of virions in the MVBs . These findings indicate that during entry the MVB is a late stage destination of CCHFV particles and is likely the site from which they are released into the cell cytoplasm to initiate genome replication . Figure 3 . CCHFV infection depends on PI3K activity . ( A ) To generate CCHFV - mKate2 , BsrT7 / 5 cells transfected with pT7 - mKate2 , pcDNA - N , and pcDNA - L were either mock - infected or infected with CCHFV . After 48 h , supernatants were transferred onto SW13 cells for 24 h . Cells were subsequently fixed , stained with Hoechst 33342 dye to identify nuclei , and photographed ( left and middle panels ) . To assess the effect of pharmacological inhibitors on CCHFV - mKate2 infection , SW13 cells were pretreated with one of the following : bafilomycin A ( 20 nM ) , EIPA ( 10 m M ) , nystatin ( 100 m M ) , dynasore ( 200 m M ) , or CPZ ( 10 m g / mL ) . After 1 h , cells were incubated with the virus in the presence of the drug for 24 h . Subsequently , cells were fixed , stained with the Hoechst 33342 dye , and imaged .

The process is rapid , with endocytosed ligands and receptors being sorted to different organelles for processing [ 56 – 59 ] . Early endosomes have been considered to be initial sorting organelles [ 57 , 59 ] , and since CCHFV infection was shown to require Rab5 , the virus was thought to traffic through this compartment [ 13 ] . However , actual localization of virions to early endosomes was not previously demonstrated . In the current study , we used microscopy to track movement of CCHF virions through endocytic compart - ments . Virions were found in early endosomes starting at 15 min post - infection ( Fig . 1A ) , although we do not exclude the possibility that the virus localized to early endosomes at even earlier time points , as has been demonstrated for influenza A virus [ 59 ] . The increase in percentage of viral particles in the endosomes at later time points , however , indicates that CCHFV may enter host cells at a slower pace , reflecting potential differences in endosomal Figure 4 .

Recently , Lakadamyali et al . suggested that early endosomes consist of two populations with distinct maturation kinetics , designated dynamic and static [ 59 ] . Cargo in the static population undergoes endocytosis less rapidly and depends , at least in part , on the presence of adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP - 2 ) [ 59 , 60 ] . CCHFV infection requires AP - 2 [ 13 ] , while influenza A virus infection does not [ 59 ] , suggesting that these two viruses may utilize different sets of early endosomes for uptake into cells .

Several viruses , including those entering cells by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , have been demonstrated to localize to MVBs and depend on the sorting protein complex , ESCRT , during infection . Influenza A virus , LASV , and LCMV appear to pass through MVBs on their way toward late endosomes , while VSV needs the compartment to release genome into the cytoplasm for replication [ 25 – 28 ] . For CCHFV , MVB involvement seems to be distinct . We found that CCHF virions localized to and dramatically affected intracellular distribution of MVBs ( Fig . 2A ) . ESCRT regulators controlled CCHFV entry ( Figs . 4 and 5D ) , and trafficking beyond MVBs appeared to be dispensable for virus infection and entry ( Figs . 2C and 6 ) , suggesting that MVBs might be the last endosomal compartment before virus exit into the cytoplasm . The small number of virus particles in Lamp1 - positive compart - ments ( Fig . 2B ) raised a question about a role , if any , of late endosomes or lysosomes in CCHFV infection . Since Rab7 controls vesicular transport out of MVBs [ 32 ] and is not essential for virus infection [ 13 ] , it is unlikely that localization of virus particles to compartments downstream of MVBs has functional significance . Additionally , a small amount of Lamp1 is found in MVBs [ 61 – 63 ] , so CCHF virions might have localized to these Lamp1 - positive MVBs . We detected virus particles by staining infected cells with an anti - N antibody , and therefore our data indicate that MVBs may be where virus - endosome fusion takes place or where , similarly to VSV , nucleocapsids are released into the cytoplasm , or both , provided membrane fusion and nucleo - capsid release are concurrent . Because our data also showed that blocking vesicular acidification resulted in inhibition of a novel CCHFV pseudotype ( Fig . 5C ) , affecting glycoprotein function and therefore virus entry , and accumulation of N , presumably virions , in MVBs ( Figs . 7A and 7C ) , MVBs are likely the site of fusion of the viral and host membranes . The role of the MVB redistribution during CCHFV infection is unclear and requires additional examination , but , to our knowledge , was not observed during infection by any other virus . While we identified Rab5A as a factor controlling CCHFV traffic from the plasma membrane to early endosomes ( Fig . 1B ) , it is less clear how virions are transported from early endosomes to MVBs . Rab7 is known to localize on a variety of organelles including early and late endosomes , MVBs , and lysosomes [ 32 , 64 , 65 ] . It is unclear , however , whether Rab7 regulates transport between these organ - elles or is itself trafficked via each to reach compartment ( s ) it functions on . A study by Vanlandingham and Ceresa showed that silencing Rab7 expression had no effect on MVB biogenesis , but instead affected lysosomal degradation of the epidermal growth factor in complex with its receptor by blocking transport / fusion between MVBs and lysosomes [ 32 ] . Our current observations ( Fig . 2C ) are in agreement with those findings , demonstrating that for CCHFV , Rab7A does not contribute to early endosome - MVB transport and therefore does not control CCHFV infection , which is consistent with previously reported data [ 13 ] . Additional factors controlling the traffic between early endosomes and MVBs remain to be identified . The formation of internal vesicles within MVB compartments requires class III PI3K , whose cellular role is to facilitate synthesis of PI3P lipid [ 25 , 42 , 43 ] . Protein sorting machinery , which selects cargo in early endosomes , is thought to directly bind early endosome - specific PI3P [ 66 , 67 ] and subsequently recruit ESCRT complexes to MVB membranes [ 68 ] . Inhibition of PI3K activity , therefore , results in formation of defective MVB compartments devoid of internal vesicles and thus missorted cargo . In the presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 , CCHFV infection was significantly reduced ( Fig . 3B ) , most likely due to the block in MVB biogenesis . In addition to its role in vesicle formation and membrane trafficking , PI3K pathway is known to regulate various cellular functions such as survival and proliferation , glucose transport , superoxide production , and motility through actin rearrangement [ 69 ] . There is mounting evidence that the PI3K pathway is often disregulated in human tumors [ 70 ] . To date , several promising PI3K inhibitors have entered human trials for cancer treatments [ 71 , 72 ] . Our current results that the PI3K pathway is also required for CCHFV infection could be exploited for development of new therapeutics to treat the CCHFV disease . One of the limiting factors in studying early steps in CCHFV infection has been the lack of a pseudotyped virus . Although pseudotype systems have been described for several bunyaviruses [ 73 – 76 ] , no such system was reported for CCHFV to date . Here , we reported a VSV core virus pseudotyped with CCHFV glycoprotein . Treatment of the pseudotyped virus with anti - Gc antibody or bafilomycin A ( Figs . 5B – C ) inhibited its infection , indicating that the entry was glycoprotein - dependent . The finding that neutralizing antibody blocked pseudotype infection also demonstrated that the pseudotype can be used in rapid diagnostic assays , circumventing the need for high - level biosafety contain - ment and pathogenic virus stocks . The bunyavirus family consists of five genera with over 350 members [ 5 ] . Of those tested , each require low pH to productively infect host cells and so , require uptake into acidified endosomes [ 22 , 77 – 81 ] . CCHFV belongs to the Nairovirus genus , and its entry route is similar to that used by members of the Orthobunyavirus genus , particularly La Crosse and Oropouche viruses . La Crosse virus infection was shown to be inhibited by overexpression of DN Rab5 , but not DN Rab7 , leading to the conclusion that this virus undergoes fusion at early endosomes [ 77 ] , as was thought to occur for CCHFV [ 32 ] . While this might be the case , given our findings , MVBs may play a similar role in La Crosse virus infection ( Figs . 2A – B ) . For Oropouche virus , virions were not seen associated with early endosomes , but did localize to Rab7 - positive endosomes [ 80 ] , indicating that the virus may bypass the early endosome compartment . However , the location of Oropouche virus particles in cells was only examined after 40 minutes . This seemingly different mechanism of entry may be explained by the rapid and / or transient movement of virions through early endosomes , which , for CCHFV , occurred as early as 15 minutes after incubation with cells . The finding that Oropouche virus was Rab7 - associated does suggest trafficking to late endosomes ; however , Rab7 is not ideal for identifying the exact endosomal compartment since it localizes to various organelles , including subsets of MVBs , late endosomes , and lysosomes [ 32 ] . It is , therefore , important to determine if either La Crosse or Oropouche virus requires the MVB for infection or if CCHFV has a unique need for this compartment .

For Hantaan virus , virions were associated with Lamp1 - positive endosomes , although functional significance of this association was not investigated [ 79 ] . A comprehensive study by Lozach et al . used a combination of microscopy as well as overexpression of DN and CA forms of Rab5 and Rab7 to track UUkuniemi virions through the endosomal network . Their findings convincingly demonstrate that UUkuniemi virus infection depends on Rab7 and requires virion localization to late endosomes or lysosomes [ 22 ] . Unfortu - nately , passage of virus particles through MVBs was not studied . These differences in entry mechanisms for viruses may reflect the broad diversity of viruses across the Bunyaviridae family . In conclusion , our work has identified a novel requirement for trafficking of CCHFV through MVBs and has shown that host proteins controlling MVB function are important host factors needed for CCHFV infection and entry . Our findings were substantiated through the production and use of a novel pseudotyped virus bearing the glycoprotein of CCHFV . This reagent will most certainly stimulate further studies on entry mechanism of the virus as well as serve as a safe diagnostic tool overcoming the need to cultivate wild - type , pathogenic virus . The knowledge acquired during the studies will help to design new strategies for therapeutic intervention against this pathogen .

One hour later , one set of cells was infected with CCHFV for 24 h and then fixed in 10 % formalin , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 minutes , blocked with 5 % goat serum ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) in PBS , and stained with CellMask blue dye to define cell boundaries ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) , rabbit anti - N antibody to identify infected cells and mouse anti - CD63 antibody at 4 u C overnight . The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor - conjugated anti - rabbit and anti - mouse antibodies ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . The block of cholesterol transport out of the MVBs in the U18666A - treated cells was confirmed by staining the second set of cells with anti - CD63 antibody followed by an Alexa Flour - conjugated secondary antibody , filipin III ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) , and CellMask red dye ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . Z - stack immunofluores - cence imaging was done on 20 cells in each sample . 3D image reconstruction was performed using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Zurich , Switzerland ) after image deconvolution by AutoQuant X3 software ( MediaCybernetics , Rockville , MD ) . The experiment was repeated three times . Numbers of cells and N - positive cells were counted using CellProfiler software . The relative infection efficiencies were calculated by dividing the number of infected cells by the number of the cells in that sample . To test the effect of CA Rab5A on virus infection , SW13 cells transfected with 0 . 1 m g of either pLenti - eGFP or the CA by electroporation were plated into 8 - chamber m - slides . Twenty - four h later , cells were incubated with CCHFV for 24 h , then fixed and stained with the HCS CellMask blue stain to define cell boundaries and a rabbit antibody to N to detect infected cells . Twenty eGFP - expressing cells in each sample were used to determine infection efficiency . The number of cells expressing both eGFP and N in each sample was divided over the total number of eGFP - positive cells in the sample to determine infection efficiency . The experiment was repeated three times . Virus internalization All immunofluorescence experiments were repeated three times . To test the colocalization between CCHFV and early endosomes , MVBs , or late endosomes / lysosomes , SW13 cells grown in 8 - chamber m - slides were incubated with the virus for indicated times at 37 u C . Then , the samples were fixed , permeabilized , and stained with antibodies : ( i ) a rabbit antibody to N and a mouse antibody to EEA1 , ( ii ) a rabbit antibody to N and a mouse antibody to CD63 , ( iii ) a mouse antibody to N and a rabbit antibody to PDCD6 ( detecting Alix / Aip1 ) , or ( iv ) a rabbit antibody to N and a mouse antibody to Lamp1 at 4 u C overnight . The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor - conjugated anti - rabbit and anti - mouse antibodies . Then , the cells were stained with the HCS CellMask blue stain to identify cells . The Z - stack immunofluorescence imaging , 3D reconstruction , and deconvolution were done on 20 cells in each sample as described above . The virion - endosome colocalization was computed using Imaris software . To assess whether the overexpression of the DN Rab5A or DN Rab7A affected the localization of virions to endosomes , SW13 cells transfected with 0 . 1 m g of pLenti - eGFP or a DN by electroporation were plated into wells of 8 - chamber slides . After 24 h , cells were incubated with CCHFV for indicated time points . Subsequently , cells were fixed , stained , and analyzed as described above . To test the effect of bafilomycin A on virus internalization , SW13 cells grown in 8 - chamber m - slides were treated with bafilomycin A to a final concentration of 20 nM or with DMSO as a control . One hour later , cells were incubated with either infectious or gamma - irradiated CCHFV . After 24 h , samples were fixed in 10 % formalin , permeabilized , and stained with CellMask blue dye to define cell boundaries , anti - N and anti - CD63 antibodies . Immu - nofluorescence imaging and 3D reconstruction were done on 20 cells in each sample as described above . The percentages of N found in MVBs were computed by Imaris software . Real - time quantitative ( q ) RT - PCR To determine whether bafilomycin A treatment affected CCHFV replication , SW13 cells grown in three 35 - mm dishes were treated with DMSO in duplicate or bafilomycin A to a final concentration of 20 nM . One h later , all dishes were inoculated with an equal amount of CCHFV . After 2 h , one set of DMSO - treated cells was subjected to RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent ( Life Technol - ogies , Carlsbad , CA ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . RNA isolation from the second set of DMSO - treated cells and bafilomycin A - treated cells took place 24 h after virus addition . Five hundred ng of extracted RNA was used to calculate CCHFV genome copies in the samples . Viral RNA levels were determined by a qRT - PCR ( TaqMan ) assay detecting sequences in the S segment of the genome using an ABI 7500 real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . To obtain a standard curve to determine CCHFV genome equivalents , synthetic CCHFV S segment RNA was generated . pT7 - Sseg was linearized with SalI ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) and used as a template to synthesize RNA using MEGAscript T7 kit ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The RNA was purified using RNAzol - Bee reagent ( Tel - Test , Friendswood , TX ) and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate - treated water ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) to 2 6 10 5 copies per m l . Then , serial 10 - fold dilutions of the stock were used to create a linear regression of the standard curve . The CCHFV primer / probe sequences span from nucleotides 1086 to 1216 and were a forward primer ( 5 9 - CTT TGC CGA TGA TTC TTT CC - 3 9 ) , a reverse primer ( 5 9 - GAC TTA GTG TGT CCA GAT CC - 3 9 ) , and a FAM / TAMRA - labeled primer ( 5 9 - TTG GGC AGC ATC ATC AGG ATT GGC - 3 9 ) . The experiment was repeated twice in duplicate . Acknowledgments We thank members of our laboratory for helpful discussions and for excellent technical support from Ms . Ann Reyes .
