Exploring and Evaluating the Potential of 2D Computational Notebooks Jesse Harden jessemh @ vt . edu Virginia Tech Blacksburg , Virginia , USA Figure 1 : Example Multi - Column 2D Computational Notebook ABSTRACT Computational notebooks are popular tools for data science and pre - sentation of computational narratives . However , their 1D structure introduces and exacerbates user issues , such as messiness , tedious navigation , inefficient use of large screen space , performance of non - linear analyses , and presentation of non - linear narratives . In this Ph . D . , we address these issues through the design , exploration , and evaluation of computational notebooks which use 2D space to organize cells , or 2D computational notebooks . Specifically , we explore whether users would use 2D space , design and evaluate a 2D computational notebook prototype for individual work , explore how users collaborate in 2D space for data science and education , create and validate a theoretical understanding of how nonlinear processes in data science cause problems when forced into a linear , 1D computational notebook , and build upon the foundation we have made to refine 2D computational notebooks . Our work con - tributes insights on if and how expanded space usage can improve computational notebooks .

Since open - sourced notebooks like Jupyter [ 6 , 9 ] emerged , millions of users from diverse fields adopted computational notebooks for their work [ 14 ] . However , computational notebooks struggle with non - linear analyses , such as comparative analyses , and non - linear narratives [ 4 , 14 ] , as well as navigating longer notebooks [ 4 ] , preventing and managing messiness [ 5 , 8 , 10 , 14 ] , and using the benefits provided by large display spaces [ 4 ] , such as Space to Think [ 1 ] . We believe these issues are caused by the current 1D , top - to - bottom organization of notebook cells . Some works [ 17 , 18 ] explored bounded 2D space usage to im - prove computational notebooks , but none explored fully breaking from current linear , 1D structures . Fork - It [ 18 ] introduced fork - ing , the temporary creation of split columns in a 1D notebook . While Fork - It helps non - linear analyses , it does not help non - linear narratives , which may benefit from a persistent multiple column approach . Similarly , Stickyland [ 17 ] allows users to " stick " cells to a persistent dock at the top of the notebook interface even when scrolling , but does not fully break from 1D . Other works used vir - tual navigation techniques , such as switching tabs , to address issues such as version control in computational notebooks [ 7 , 8 ] , or pro - vided tools to address messiness [ 5 ] . However , none of these works make full use of the 2D space provided by large displays to organize items and engage in sensemaking [ 1 , 13 ] . We propose 2D space usage for computational notebooks , break - ing away from linear and mostly - linear notebooks . This direction is inspired by Space to Think [ 1 ] , and a deep understanding of issues with current computational notebooks [ 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 14 ] . We believe 2D space usage can address issues such as messiness , non - linear 97 ISS Companion ’23 , November 05 – 08 , 2023 , Pittsburgh , PA , USA Harden analyses and narratives , like those with comparisons between mul - tiple visualizations , and serve as a strong foundation for further exploration , design , and evaluation of expanded space usage for computational notebook , such as 3D with augmented or virtual reality . 2 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES & RESEARCH QUESTIONS The focus of this research is anchored on the general research ques - tion : How can we improve computational notebooks by utilizing 2D space ? 2D space can enable Space to Think [ 1 ] and expand options for organizing cells [ 4 ] . We divide this broad research question into more specific research questions : RQ0 : Given a 2D environment , how would users organize computational notebook cells ? It is important to first confirm users would actually use 2D space to create nonlinear computational notebooks . If users aren’t interested , our research might be used by no one . Previous studies [ 17 , 18 ] exploring bounded breaks from the linear , 1D computational notebook structure suggest users would use 2D space . Given the added complexity from moving from 1D to 2D , we also wanted to see what organizational patterns besides strictly linear might emerge . Thus , we ran a user study which gave users the option to organize cells in 2D space [ 4 ] , and found several nonlinear organizational patterns . RQ1 : Does a well - organized 2D computational notebook provide efficiency and usability benefits for individual work over 1D notebooks ? Given that we found users would use 2D space [ 4 ] , we next asked if 2D space provides improvements over 1D , and what those improvements might be . We designed an extension to Jupyter Notebooks that enables the Multi - Column organizational pattern found in our prior work [ 4 ] and evaluated it in comparison to 1D on several tasks in a controlled study [ 3 ] . We found that a well - organized 2D computational notebook enhances usability and efficiency on some common tasks in data science and analysis , especially as it concerns comparisons of outputs . RQ2 : How would users collaborate on data science and analysis in real time with a 2D computational notebook en - vironment using a large display and laptops ? While individual data science work improves in 2D , collaboration within such an en - vironment needs exploring . We plan to run a study like the second study in Wang et al . [ 16 ] with a 2D collaborative coding platform and focus on usage patterns and benefits compared to 1D . RQ3 : How would teachers and students use a 2D compu - tational notebook environment for lectures and classwork ? Given how computational notebooks are integrated into educa - tional settings for computer science , we will explore how teachers and students use 2D computational notebooks and compare that to previous works with current 1D computational notebooks . We are considering what to ask students and how to prompt reflections from instructors . RQ4 : What problems do computational notebooks have that may be caused by their linear , 1D structure ? Identifying and validating tasks within data science that lead to problems when they are forced into a linear , 1D computational notebook environ - ment enables targeted research . Learning how and why current computational notebooks suffer from linearity , we can better design and evaluate computational notebooks with expanded space usage , such as 2D notebooks , to address these issues . RQ5 : How can we make 2D computational notebook envi - ronments better ? With the foundation laid by the prior studies , we can further improve 2D computational notebooks . These works also explore design challenges and opportunities for 2D notebooks , such as navigation and organization issues ; building upon this knowl - edge , we will make 2D computational notebooks better for end users so that they can better reap the benefits of 2D space usage , such as Space to Think [ 1 ] . Thus , this Ph . D . dissertation attempts the following contribu - tions : a survey of existing work on computational notebooks , an exploration and empirical evaluation of 2D space for compu - tational notebooks for both individual and collaborative work , a theory of how nonlinear processes in data science cause issues with linear computational notebooks , and a refinement of 2D computa - tional notebooks with respect to design requirements , opportunities and / or challenges . 3 METHODOLOGY We have defined ( 5 ) five distinct phases of this research : ( 1 ) Review - ing Literature & Sanity Check , ( 2 ) Investigating Solo Work , ( 3 ) Investigating Collaborative Work , ( 4 ) Exploring How Non - linearity Causes Issues , and ( 5 ) Building on the Foundation of 2D Computational Notebooks . In the Reviewing Literature & Sanity Check phase , we re - viewed computational notebook literature , such as pain points [ 2 ] and recent developments using bounded 2D in current computa - tional notebooks [ 17 , 18 ] . Our review supports the idea of nonlinear notebooks from both the recent developments [ 17 , 18 ] and work by Rule , Tabard , and Hollan [ 14 ] ; the latter noted that support for nonlinear narratives was a key design opportunity . After our re - view , we conducted a user study to see if computational notebook users would actually use 2D space to organize notebook cells [ 4 ] , and how . Most participants used 2D space , either using a multi - column organizational pattern or more complex 2D patterns we called workboard patterns ; these included directed graphs . This phase’s findings validated our assumption that users would likely make use of 2D space , answering RQ0 . In the Investigating Solo Work phase , we developed and evalu - ated an extension enabling the multi - column organizational pattern we found earlier [ 4 ] . We did a within - subjects , counterbalanced user study with users performing a set of tasks in both 1D compu - tational notebooks and 2D , multi - column computational notebooks . We measured time to completion in both conditions , and surveyed said users on the usability of each condition . We found users gen - erally took less time to perform tasks in 2D and found 2D more usable than the standard 1D approach [ 3 ] . This phase validated our assumption that the use of 2D space for organizing computa - tional notebook cells could improve upon the current linear state of computational notebooks as an answer to RQ1 . In the Investigating Collaborative Work phase , we plan to run two distinct studies : one on collaborative data science and another on educational usage of a 2D computational notebook environment . Both studies will utilize SAGE3 . 98 Exploring and Evaluating the Potential of 2D Computational Notebooks ISS Companion ’23 , November 05 – 08 , 2023 , Pittsburgh , PA , USA The first study will extend work by Wang et al . [ 16 ] exploring real - time collaboration in data science with computational note - books by comparing 2D collaborative notebooks with 1D ones . We plan to mostly replicate the methodology of the second study , a user study , in the paper by Wang et al . [ 16 ] with some differences . We will have two 2 - hour sessions to complete the data science task instead of 4 1 - hour sessions , and sessions will be co - located with laptops and a large display instead of distributed in location . We currently plan to use the same general dataset and task that was used by Wang et al . [ 16 ] to better enable comparisons between our work and this prior work . This study will explore RQ2 . The second study will focus on exploring 2D computational note - books in computer science education to answer RQ3 . We will use student surveys and instructor reflections ( including our own ) to better understand how a 2D computational notebook environment can improve education . In the Exploring How Nonlinearity Causes Issues phase , we will survey data scientists to gain insights into RQ4 on how problematic nonlinear aspects of data science work is in current , 1D computational notebooks . We have identified some nonlinear aspects of data science work that may be problematic in 1D , and have written up definitions and potential challenges caused by them . As of this writing , we have drafted and refined the survey instrument , and plan to launch it soon . In the Building on the Foundation of 2D Computational Notebooks phase , we will build on the foundation laid for 2D com - putational notebooks . This phase could go various ways , such as connecting computational notebook cells and related items in a force - directed graph for ease of arrangement , creating and using templates for organizing computational notebook cells in 2D , au - tomated switching between templates , and targeted research on addressing design challenges found in previous studies or nonlinear aspects of data science work as found in the survey for RQ4 . 4 OPEN QUESTIONS & ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION We want a rich discussion on topics like ( i ) current works in progress and ( ii ) our final steps to refine 2D computational notebooks , such as design opportunities , further research questions , and more . On our current works in progress , we invite discussion on the studies for RQ2 , RQ3 , and RQ4 . For RQ2 , the collaborative data science study , we seek discussion on qualitative methods to gain in - sights from recorded videos of the sessions , interviews , and surveys . For RQ3 , the education study , we seek discussion on questions to survey students on and reflection prompts for instructors . We plan to have a draft survey for students by ISS 2023 . For RQ4 , the theory of nonlinearity in linear notebooks survey study , we seek discussion on questions for potential interviews of survey respondents . For the dissertation’s final steps , we seek discussion on what direction would likely prove most beneficial to researchers and data science practitioners to pursue . While we have our ideas on each item , we seek further input to ensure that more refined research , and we believe that the ISS 2023 Doctoral Symposium would be an excellent place for discussion .
