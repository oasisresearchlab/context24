In addition to generating mechanical forces and sensing mechanical deformation , dynamic F - actin networks serve as cellular tracks for myosin motor trafﬁc . However , much of our mechanistic under - standing of processive myosins comes from in vitro studies in which motility was studied on pre - assem - bled and artiﬁcially stabilized , static F - actin tracks . In this work , we examine the role of actin dynamics in single - molecule myosin motility using assembling F - actin and two highly processive motors , myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 . These two myosins have distinct func - tions in the cell and travel in opposite directions along actin ﬁlaments [ 1 – 3 ] . Myosin - 5 walks toward the barbed ends of F - actin , traveling to sites of actin polymerization at the cell periphery [ 4 ] . Myosin - 6 walks toward the pointed end of F - actin [ 5 ] , traveling toward the cell center along older segments of the actin ﬁlament . We ﬁnd that myosin - 5 takes 1 . 3 - to 1 . 5 - fold longer runs on ADP d P i ( young ) F - actin , whereas myosin - 6 takes 1 . 7 - to 3 . 6 - fold longer runs along ADP ( old ) F - actin . These results suggest that conformational differences between ADP d P i and ADP F - actin tailor these myosins to walk farther toward their preferred actin ﬁlament end . Taken together , these experiments deﬁne a new mecha - nism by which myosin trafﬁc may sort to different F - actin networks depending on ﬁlament age . RESULTS Actin Nucleotide Turnover as an Indicator of Filament Age Actin ﬁlaments in eukaryotic cells are typically born near the plasma membrane and age as they travel inward by retrograde ﬂow [ 6 ] . Concomitantly , they acquire diverse actin - binding pro - teinsthattuneF - actinorganizationanddynamics , deﬁningsubcel - lular actin compartments . These actin - binding proteinscould alter myosinmotility , directmyosinstoseparatecompartments , andul - timately serve to organize the cell . One example is tropomyosins , which differentially direct myosin - 1 s and myosin - 2 s [ 7 , 8 ] and are essential for the processivity of budding yeast myosin - 5 [ 9 ] . Here , we consider a simple process that might generate distinct F - actin populations independent of actin - binding pro - teins , namely actin ﬁlament aging . As new ATP - actin monomers add to the barbed end of a nascent ﬁlament , aging begins with ATP turnover serving as an internal molecular clock . Filament ag - ing is a process that occurs in three sequential events : addition of an ATP actin monomer to the barbed end of the ﬁlament , ATP hydrolysis , and phosphate release [ 10 ] . ATP hydrolysis oc - curs (cid:1) 3 s after monomeric ATP - actin adds to the F - actin barbed end . At typical growth rates of (cid:1) 10 monomers / s at 1 . 0 m M glob - ular actin ( G - actin ) , the barbed - end ATP cap has 30 monomers and is (cid:1) 100 nm long . Release of inorganic phosphate ( P i ) from ADP d P i F - actin is 100 - fold slower , taking (cid:1) 380 s and yielding ADP F - actin that persists for the lifetime of the ﬁlament . ATP hy - drolysis and P i release are stochastic processes , so the ATP and ADP d P i populations decay from the barbed to the pointed end as approximately single exponential functions . Whereas ATP and ADP d P i F - actin are structurally similar , ADP F - actin is less stable and more ﬂexible [ 11 , 12 ] . Thus , we focus here on the transition from ADP d P i to ADP actin . Reconstituting Myosin Motility on Growing Actin Filaments Standard motility assays use phalloidin - stabilized actin ﬁlaments that are prepared in advance [ 13 , 14 ] . Phalloidin is typically added after the assembly reaction reaches steady - state , although most of the myosin motility studies do not indicate when phalloidin was added , only that it was present . Here , we examined the motile properties of myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 on growing ﬁlaments with an ADP d P i population gradient ( ‘‘ADP d P i decay’’ ) , compared to aged , phalloidin - stabilized actin that is in a uniform ADP state ( Figure 1A ) . In both cases , the actin was polymerized with 5 % TMR - actin for visualization . Dual - color TIRF imaging shows the continuous growth of F - actin at the barbed end and directed myosin movements along the ﬁlament ( Figure 1B ; Movie S1 ) . Myosin Run Lengths Are Sensitive to Growing or Static F - Actin We projected actin ﬁlament tracings along the time axis to generate kymographs ( Figure 1C ) . We also separately traced Current Biology 25 , 2057 – 2062 , August 3 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 2057 the ﬁlament barbed and pointed ends in the kymographs . Myosin runs appear as diagonal lines with a slope that reports the speed and a projected y axis displacement that reports the run length . As expected , myosin - 5 travels toward the growing barbed end at the top of kymographs , whereas myosin - 6 travels toward the relatively static pointed end at the bottom of kymo - graphs ( Figure 1C ) . There is no signiﬁcant change in either motor’s speed ( Figures S1A and S1B ; Table S1 ) . Likewise , F - actin assembly rates are unaffected by either myosin motor ( Figure S1C ) . However , elon - gating ﬁlaments affected myosin run lengths with approximately equal magnitude but in opposite directions for the two myosins . Myosin - 5 mean run lengths are 1 . 4 - fold longer on growing ﬁla - ments ( ADP d P i decay ) compared to phalloidin - stabilized ﬁla - ments ( ADP ; Figures 2Ai , 2Aiii , and 2B ; Table S2 ) . Conversely , myosin - 6 mean run lengths are 1 . 7 - fold longer on phalloidin - sta - bilized ﬁlaments ( ADP ) compared to growing actin ( ADP d P i decay ; Figures 2Ai , 2Aiii , and 2C ; Table S2 ) . Myosin Run Lengths Correlate with Filament Age , but Not the Stabilizer Two primary features differ between the growing and stabilized ﬁlaments : the nucleotide state of the ﬁlament and the presence or absence of phalloidin . To determine the basis of the run length effect , we stabilized actin ﬁlaments without phalloidin . We added 10 nM capping protein after initial ﬁlament assembly to prevent the depolymerization of aged ﬁlaments upon dilu - tion . Although elongation is terminated , this arrangement produces F - actin with an ADP d P i decay along its length ( Fig - ure 2Aiv ) . To emulate the phalloidin - stabilized ﬁlaments in the ADP state , we simply aged the capped ﬁlaments before imag - ing ( Figure 2Aii ) . We observed the same trends on capped and aged ﬁlaments as on phalloidin - stabilized ﬁlaments . Myosin - 5 runs 1 . 3 - fold farther on capped ADP d P i actin decay ﬁlaments ( Figure 2D ) , whereas myosin - 6 runs 2 - fold farther on capped ADP actin ﬁla - ments ( Figure 2E ) . We expect weaker run length effects here , because after capping the ﬁlament decays to the ADP state without replenishment of ATP - monomers at the barbed end . Myosin run lengths on freshly capped ﬁlaments resemble the run lengths on growing actin tracks , whereas aged and capped ﬁlaments resemble aged and phalloidin - stabilized ﬁlaments ( Fig - ure S2 ) . We conclude that phalloidin does not directly alter myosin run lengths . The Actin Nucleotide State Dictates Myosin Run Lengths Our results suggest that the actin nucleotide state itself inﬂu - ences myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 processivity . We tested this hy - pothesis using phalloidin to generate actin ﬁlaments containing exclusively ADP d P i or ADP subunits . Phalloidin dramatically slows P i release , inhibiting the transition from ADP d P i to ADP actin ( for > 20 hr ) , but leaves ATP - hydrolysis unaffected [ 15 ] . Thus , copolymerization of actin with phalloidin yields uniform ADP d P i ﬁlaments ( Figure 2Av ) . In contrast , addition of phalloidin after ﬁlaments have assembled and aged yields exclusively ADP ﬁlaments ( Figure 2Ai ) . We rejected alternative approaches involving nucleotide analogs or P i competition because of their direct effects on myosin activity . Myosin motility on phalloidin - stabilized ADP d P i or ADP actin ﬁlaments show that run length trends follow the nucleotide state . Myosin - 5 mean run lengths are 1 . 5 - fold longer on ADP d P i than on ADP phalloidin ﬁlaments . Conversely , myosin - 6 run lengths are 3 . 6 - fold longer on ADP than on ADP d P i phalloidin ﬁlaments ( Fig - ures 2F and 2G ; Table S2 ) . Because these F - actin tracks have a uniform nucleotide state , rather than a mixture in our other exper - iments , this phalloidin experiment should more closely report the intrinsic discrimination ability of each myosin for ADP d P i versus ADP actin ﬁlaments . If the nucleotide state of actin dictates myosin run length , the transition to aged ﬁlaments should be detectable on the Figure 1 .

We therefore performed a time course experiment in which myosin - 5 run lengths were measured on assembling F - actin tracks where polymerization was quenched 0 or 5 min prior to imaging . As predicted , myosin - 5 runs 1 . 6 - fold farther on 0 - min - versus 5 - min - old F - actin ( Figure S3 ) .

Reported fold differences apply to mean run lengths , and p values report the log rank test . See Table S2 for summary statistics . the growing barbed end sample predom - inantly ADP d P i - actin , whereas those near the pointed end sample predominantly ADP - actin . To correlate myosin run lengths to actin nucleotide state , we associated each point in a myosin run with the age of the actin monomer at that point . From the actin age and the re - ported phosphate release decay rate , we calculated the probability of each actin subunit being in the ADP d P i - actin state ( P ( ADP d P i ) ) . The schematic kymograph in Fig - ure 3A of a representative assembling F - actin track shows P ( ADP d P i ) along an aging ﬁlament . We grouped myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 runs along growing ﬁla - ments into two categories : low or high P ( ADP d P i ) actin . Consis - tent with our earlier ﬁndings , the myosins exhibit opposite run length preferences . Myosin - 5 takes 1 . 1 - fold longer runs in the actin zone with the upper 33 % of P ( ADP d P i ) values ( Figure 3B ; Table S3 ) , where myosin - 6 runs are 1 . 8 - fold longer in the bottom 33 % of P ( ADP d P i ) values ( Figure 3C ; Table S3 ) . Thus , these two myosins can sense the F - actin nucleotide state in different Current Biology 25 , 2057 – 2062 , August 3 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 2059 regions of the same set of ﬁlaments . This ﬁnding rules out a concerted , all - or - none conformational change in the ﬁlament ; instead , the structural features of F - actin that these two myosins sense must be local in nature . The Actin Nucleotide State Also Affects Myosin Landing Rates Overall cellular transport may be regulated by controlling either the run length or the frequency of myosin runs . To determine whether actin nucleotide state also regulates run frequency , we examined the rate at which myosins encounter F - actin and start a processive run , also known as the landing rate ( Figure 4 ) . In general , conditions that favor increased run lengths also favor increased landing rates . For example , median myosin - 5 landing rates are 4 - fold enhanced on ADP d P i , phalloidin - copoly F - actin over ADP , phalloidin F - actin ( Figure 4A ) . Likewise , median myosin - 6 landing rates are 2 - fold enhanced on ADP , phalloidin ﬁlaments , compared to ADP d P i , phalloidin - copoly ﬁlaments ( Fig - ure 4B ) . Increased landing rates drive myosins on to ﬁlament populations that they are tailored for longer run lengths , leading to an overall increase in trafﬁcking capacity . DISCUSSION We ﬁnd that myosin - 5 runs farther on the younger , ADP d P i - rich actin , whereas myosin - 6 travels farther on older , ADP - rich actin . Interestingly , one study found that the myosin - 5 run length in un - treated cells was 1 . 5 - fold higher than in cells with blocked F - actin dynamics [ 16 ] . This difference is strikingly similar to what we ﬁnd here , under conditions where F - actin growth rates are also similar ( 20 monomers / s versus 10 monomers / s ) . Our results are also consistent with a 20 % reduction of kinesin proc - essivity on GMPCPP microtubules versus Taxol - stabilized GDP microtubules [ 17 ] , illustrating that similar principles apply to microtubule tracks and motors . Coupling of myosin motor activity to actin’s nucleotide state suggests two guidelines for future work . First , because order of addition matters , it is important to state when phalloidin is added in F - actin polymerization . We suspect that phalloidin is typically added after completion of polymerization . Second , when myosin motility is examined at high P i concentrations , sec - ondary actin effects should be considered alongside the primary myosin effects on force generation and stiffness [ 18 ] . We ﬁnd that myosin run lengths are affected by the actin nucleotide state , whereas myosin speeds are not . Myosin run lengths increase with the duty ratio , deﬁned as fraction of the ATPase cycle time when the motor is bound to its ﬁlament . An increased duty ratio decreases the period in which the myosin is vulnerable to detach . The two ways to increase the myosin duty ratio are to accelerate rebinding to F - actin or to inhibit F - actin detachment . Because the speed does not change , and because ADP release gates detachment while being rate - limiting for both of these myosins [ 19 , 20 ] , the F - actin nucleotide state likely affects the overall rate of strong binding to actin . This accelerated binding scenario is consistent with the increases in myosin landing rates in Figure 4 , on opposite types of actin for myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 . Myosins may sense the actin nucleotide state in two ways . The ﬁrst is a classical molecular recognition mechanism involving actin subdomain 2 ( SD2 ) , a key determinant of ﬁlament ﬂexibility and stability . Release of P i causes SD2 to rotate 15 (cid:4) , closing the nucleotide - binding cleft [ 21 , 22 ] . In addition , the DNase - I - bind - ing loop folds into an alpha helix upon P i release [ 23 ] , changing the longitudinal subunit contacts within the ﬁlament and A B C 0 . 6 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 4 Myosin - 5 Myosin - 6 Figure 3 .

Myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 may directly sense the orientation of actin SD2 . Recent work re - vealed that strong binding of myosin to F - actin involves interac - tions between actin SD2 and myosin loop 2 , loop 3 , and the car - diomyopathy loop [ 25 ] . There are many sequence differences between myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 at the actin - binding interface that could inﬂuence sensing of the SD2 orientation . In particular , loop 2 is longer in myosin - 5 , and changes in the loop 2 region are known to affect actin binding [ 26 , 27 ] . Alternatively , these two myosins may recognize ﬂexibility dif - ferences between the stiffer ADP d P i state and the softer ADP state of F - actin . Stiffened F - actin inhibits gliding ﬁlament motility on skeletal myosin - 2 , without affecting myosin enzymatic activity [ 28 ] . Furthermore , both myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 decoration in - crease the torsional dynamics of F - actin , whereas myosin - 2 has the opposite effect [ 29 , 30 ] . By thermodynamic linkage , we expect that changes in ﬁlament dynamics also affect myosin binding in an isoform - speciﬁc manner . One difﬁculty with this argument is that myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 both increase torsional dynamics . However , one signiﬁcant difference is that these studies used monomeric motor domain ‘‘S1’’ fragments , whereas ours used dimeric motors . Dimeric myosin - 5 may prefer stiffer ﬁlaments , because its long and stiff lever arms would serve to buttress the actin ﬁlament . In contrast , dimeric myosin - 6 has more ﬂexible lever arms that are oriented nearly parallel to the ﬁlament [ 31 ] and therefore provide little additional stiffening . Regulation of myosin motility by the nucleotide state of F - actin is expected to be important in cells . Although the nucleotide state of actin ﬁlaments in cells has not been experimentally determined , different F - actin networks are enriched for ADP d P i or ADP F - actin [ 32 ] . Because P i release takes (cid:1) 6 min [ 33 ] , net - works that turnover in seconds at the leading edge of migrating cells consist primarily of ADP d P i ﬁlaments . Remodeled networks farther from the leading edge turn over slowly and are likely to have ADP ﬁlaments . Given that the severing protein ADF / coﬁlin binds tighter to ADP F - actin than ADP d P i F - actin [ 34 ] , ADF / coﬁlin localization might indicate the cellular nucleotide state of F - actin . As predicted , ADF / coﬁlin is absent from F - actin at the leading edge of migrating cells but strongly localizes to F - actin deeper into the cell [ 35 ] . Actin - binding proteins may also regulate myosin activity in cells by indirectly affecting the nucleotide state of F - actin . For example , ADF / coﬁlin allosterically increases the amount of ADP F - actin by accelerating the rate of P i release from unoccupied ﬁlament subunits [ 36 ] . Because myosin - 5 moves 10 - fold faster than the elongation rate of the barbed end ( (cid:1) 300 nm / s versus (cid:1) 30 nm / s ) , myosin - 5 is able to overtake the F - actin ADP d P i decay and reach increas - ingly younger actin subunits as it walks . Myosin - 6 travels in the direction of aging and therefore reaches older actin subunits with each step . We ﬁnd it interesting that each myosin has evolved to move in a direction that carries it to more - favorable transport conditions . Thus , myosin - 5 and myosin - 6 both head toward greener pastures , allowing enhanced transport of myosin - 5 cargoes to the cell periphery and myosin - 6 cargoes to the cell interior . Although we fully expect that ABPs in the cell further modulate myosin activity , such effects would be in addition to the inherent ability of these myosins to discriminate ﬁlaments based on age . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Proteins and imaging conditions are described in the Supplemental Experi - mental Procedures . Myosin run lengths were analyzed using Kaplan - Meier survival curves to correct for the ﬁnite length of the F - actin track [ 37 ] . Motor run lengths were left truncated at 400 nm to handle missed events that were too short to detect . Myosin runs known to underestimate the true run length were treated as right censored intheKaplan - Meier estimator . These artiﬁcially short runs occur when a myosin reaches the end of a ﬁlament , myosins that start at the beginning of a movie or terminate at the end , or myosins that cross the P ( ADP d P i ) threshold indicated in Figure 3 .
