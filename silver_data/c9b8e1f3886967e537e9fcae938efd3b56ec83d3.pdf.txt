The regional and temporal viscoelastic mechanical properties in post - puncture inser - tion are valuable for guiding probe insertion into each region on the implanting trajectory . 1 Introduction Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) of the sub - thalamic nucleus ( STN ) has rapidly gained popularity in patients with Parkinson ’ s disease [ 1 – 4 ] . The surgical procedure involves inserting a coaxial probe comprised of a guide cannula and its internal core needle into brain tissues on the implanting trajectory before microelectrode recording ( MER ) is implemented to determine the exact position of the STN [ 5 , 6 ] . It appears that brain tissues beneath the insertion site will be impacted and compressed after the cortical surface is touched . Moreover , the probe will tear , shear , or compress extracellular matrix , capillaries , and ﬁ ber tracts after the cortical surface is punctured [ 7 , 8 ] . Consequently , mechan - ical traumas ( cell death , edema , or disruption of nervous tissues ) and brain tissue deformation ( dimpling or target shift ) will be ignited , which will inevitably cause brain injuries and targeting errors during the STN - DBS surgery [ 9 – 11 ] . To improve surgical safety and therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy , the STN - DBS surgery must minimize mechanical traumas and brain tissue deformation caused by probe insertion . A better understanding of brain tissue – probe interaction mechanism * Jianxin Deng jxdeng @ sdu . edu . cn * Jun Zhou zhoujun @ sdu . edu . cn 1 Key Laboratory of High Ef ﬁ ciency and Clean Mechanical Manufacture of MOE , Department of Mechanical Engineering , Shandong University , Jinan 250061 , PR China 2 Department of Neurosurgery , Qilu Hospital of Shandong University , Jinan 250012 , PR China is valuable for surgical operation planning , surgeon training , and optimizing probe insertion strategies [ 12 , 13 ] . However , brain is non - visible . It is impossible to directly visualize brain tissue – probe interaction and corresponding responses , which prevents the exploration of brain injuries and tar - geting errors [ 1 , 5 , 14 , 15 ] . Modern computational resources can offer the promise of biomechanical models capable of investigating internal surgical load patterns , stress – strain ﬁ eld distribution , as well as the causes and consequences of brain tissue deformation [ 16 – 19 ] . It is important to note that appropriate data required to characterize bio ﬁ delic mechanical properties of involved brain tissues is a pre - requisite . The brain is a morphologically and mechanically heterogeneous organ which is characterized by multiple anatomical structures and somewhat distinct mechanical properties [ 16 , 20 – 22 ] . Besides , due to the wide range of loading conditions , mechanical properties of brain tissues are dif ﬁ cult to reconcile [ 12 , 16 , 20 , 22 – 26 ] . Mechanical properties of brain tissues have been researched extensively . Nevertheless , the results are not associated with probe insertion during the STN - DBS sur - gery which has a straight implanting trajectory from the middle frontal gyrus to the STN [ 1 , 2 ] . Dommelon et al . [ 24 ] , Pervin et al . [ 27 ] , and Prevost et al . [ 28 ] conducted explorations of mechanical properties of brain tissues by indentation and compression but their qualitative results cannot accurately predict brain tissue responses under the inserting mode . The results by Miller et al . [ 23 , 26 ] obtained based on uncon ﬁ ned extension / compression experiments were regarded suitable for low strain - rate surgery , but their samples were idealized isotropic and taken from portions between the ventricle surface and the arachnoid membrane . Elkin et al . [ 16 , 20 , 22 ] proposed temporal and spatial heterogeneity of mechanical properties of rat / porcine brains , whereas their indentation tests were conducted in coronal or sagittal planes . Consequently , these data cannot be directly introduced into structures on the implanting trajectory of the STN - DBS surgery . During the STN - DBS surgery , the coaxial probe inser - tion can be divided into pre - puncture and post - puncture insertion , with their individual loading conditions and dif - ferent tissue responses . In pre - puncture insertion , the cap - sule of the cortical surface has not been penetrated by the probe tip . Insertion force is due to the elasticity of the intact capsule and brain tissues below [ 29 , 30 ] . In post - puncture insertion , brain tissues directly beneath the hemispherical probe tip will be tore apart and punched radially along the contour of the probe tip [ 7 , 8 ] . Then , the punched brain tissues will slip onto the sidewall of the guide cannula and relax therein . Note that , all brain tissues on the implanting trajectory will experience a step radial punch with the amplitude equal to the radius of the probe and a subsequent hold on the sidewall with further probe insertion . The process coincides well with indentation stress relaxation tests . Thus , viscoelastic mechanical behaviors of brain tis - sues are dominated in post - puncture insertion [ 16 , 20 , 22 ] . To improve simulation accuracy of probe insertion , mechanical properties of brain tissues should be de ﬁ ned according to their individual loading conditions of pre - puncture and post - puncture insertion , respectively . In this paper , elastic mechanical properties of brain tis - sues in pre - puncture insertion and viscoelastic mechanical properties in post - puncture insertion are investigated through pre - puncture needle insertion experiments and indentation stress relaxation tests , respectively . The Young ’ s modulus of brain tissues in pre - puncture is cal - culated from the slope of the force – displacement response of a ﬂ at - ended needle . Corresponding to post - puncture insertion , viscoelastic mechanical properties of six regions along a planned trajectory are tested through indentation stress relaxation tests . Using Boltzmann hereditary integral convolved with the velocity pro ﬁ le of the indenter , a linear viscoelastic model with a Prony series approximation is ﬁ tted to the average load trace of each region . Shear relaxation moduli of each region are calculated using the generated parameters of the Prony series approximation . Based on statistical comparisons between shear relaxation moduli of each region , spatial and temporal heterogeneity of brain tissues on the planned trajectory is revealed . 2 Materials and methods 2 . 1 Experimental setup Figure 1 shows the schematic of the experimental setup . XY - axis worktable and Z - axis linear actuator ( stroke length : 100 mm , maximum velocity : 50 mm / s , positioning repeat - ability : 0 . 5 μ m ; M - L01 . 4A1 , Physik Instrumente , Germany ) are actuated by programmable stepper motors . Linear travel is controlled with customized GUI software using a com - puter numerical control ( CNC ) system . A six degree of freedom force / torque sensor with resolution of 3 mN Fig . 1 The schematic of experimental setup 163 Page 2 of 12 J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2016 ) 27 : 163 ( NANO17 - SI - 12 - 0 . 12 , ATI Industrial Automation , USA ) is secured to the Z - axis linear actuator . A Φ 1 . 5 mm ﬂ at - ended stainless - steel cylindrical needle and a Φ 5 . 0 mm ﬂ at - ended stainless - steel cylindrical indenter can be attached to the NANO17 sensor using a customized holder . A ﬂ at - bot - tomed container with arti ﬁ cial cerebrospinal ﬂ uid ( aCSF ) at room temperature ( ~ 22 °C ) is put on the left of the work - table . Oxygen in an oxygen cylinder can be supplied into aCSF at the rate of approximate 35 ml / min to maintain freshness of ex - vivo brains for pre - puncture needle insertion experiments . A petri dish to which the slices are adhered for indentation stress relaxation tests is located on the right of the worktable . The entire setup is rested on a vibration isolation platform . 2 . 2 Tissue preparation Porcine brains can act as substitutes for human brains owing to similar anatomic and mechanical properties [ 20 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 32 ] . Prange et al . [ 25 , 31 ] demonstrated fresh adult human brain tissues were slightly stiffer than adult porcine brain tissues . Nicolle et al . [ 32 ] observed no signi ﬁ cant differences between mechanical properties of human and porcine brains . Considering these similarities and dif ﬁ cul - ties of obtaining human brains , all experiments were implemented using ex - vivo porcine brains . Fresh porcine brains from 6 month - old healthy pigs were collected as by - products of standard slaughtering procedures . All proce - dures were approved by Shandong University Animal Care and Use Committee . To maintain freshness , porcine brains were preserved in ice - cold oxygenated aCSF and trans - ported back . The dura , arachnoid membranes , pia , cerebellum , and partial brainstem were removed before exploring the corresponding implanting trajectory from the middle frontal gyrus to the STN of porcine brains . As shown in Figs . 2a and b , each hemisphere was separated using a surgical scalpel from the mid - sagittal plane . Based on the results of D ’ Haese et al . [ 33 ] , the position of the STN projected to the mid - sagittal plane was determined by an experienced neu - rosurgeon from Qilu hospital . To explore a speci ﬁ c plane containing a parenchymal trajectory avoiding sulcus , blood vessels , and lateral ventricles [ 1 , 4 ] , each hemisphere was sectioned along several planes passing through the middle frontal gyrus and the STN . Finally , as depicted by the coarse dotted line in Fig . 2b , the plane approximately per - pendicular to the mid - sagittal plane could satisfy the cri - teria . The cross section of the ﬁ nally determined plane was demonstrated in Fig . 2c . The coarse dotted line in Fig . 2c represented the planned parenchymal trajectory from the entry point within the middle frontal gyrus to the STN . As shown in Fig . 2a , on the cortical surface , the position of the entry point of the planned trajectory was within the labeled area described by the dotted ellipse . Therefore , pre - puncture needle insertion experiments would be conducted within the corresponding area of each hemisphere . To mimic arachnoid and pia incision for accommodating the probe [ 5 ] , arachnoid membranes and pia within the corre - sponding area were gently removed . Then , the porcine brain was directly placed in the ﬂ at - bottomed container in its natural state with entry points out of aCSF ( Fig . 1 ) . The level of aCSF located between half of the brain height and the labeled area . The buoyancy of aCSF could overcome partial gravity of the porcine brain as well as the corre - sponding deformation and help to keep its shape . As demonstrated in Fig . 2c , six regions along the planned trajectory were manually selected based on their morpho - logical characteristics . These regions included sub - thalamus Fig . 2 Harvest process of porcine brain slices a . Photograph of a whole porcine brain . The length of cerebrum is ~ 72 . 5 mm .

Six interested regions labeled by circles along the planned trajectory depicted by the coarse dotted line ( Sth = sub - thalamus around the STN , Dth = dorsal thalamus , RG 1 = the region 1 mainly composed of white matter close to lateral ventricle , RG 2 = the region 2 mixed by gray and white matter close to lateral ventricle , CR = corona radiate , and Ctx = the cortex ) J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2016 ) 27 : 163 Page 3 of 12 163 around the STN ( Sth ) , dorsal thalamus ( Dth ) , the region 1 mainly composed of white matter close to lateral ventricle ( RG 1 ) , the region 2 mixed by gray and white matter close to lateral ventricle ( RG 2 ) , corona radiate ( CR ) , and the cortex ( Ctx ) . Before each indentation stress relaxation test for a speci ﬁ c region , a 5 mm - thick slice between the ﬁ nally determined plane and a plane parallel with it ( Fig . 2b ) was harvested and adhered to the petri dish with a thin ﬁ lm of cyanoacrylate glue [ 20 , 22 ] ( one slice per region per hemisphere , 12 ≥ n ≥ 10 slices per region ) . During all pre - paring procedures , brain tissues were immersed in aCSF . 2 . 3 Mechanical testing 2 . 3 . 1 Pre - puncture needle insertion experiments Currently , the Ø1 . 5 mm stainless - steel guide cannulas are widely used during the STN - DBS surgery [ 1 , 6 ] . Thus , the Ø1 . 5 mm ﬂ at - ended stainless - steel cylindrical needle should be introduced into pre - puncture needle insertion experi - ments . Velocities of probe insertion into brain tissues during the STN - DBS surgery had never been clearly described in the literature . Based on estimating the experienced neuro - surgeon ’ s hands , the insertion velocity of 5 mm / s was employed . The sequence of pre - puncture needle insertion experi - ments was as follows . Firstly , the Ø1 . 5 mm needle was attached to the NANO17 sensor and positioned ~ 1 mm above an entry point by moving XY - axis worktable and Z - axis linear actuator . Next , the NANO17 sensor was reset to zero . Then , the needle was continually moved down at the velocity of 5 mm / s until the cortical surface was punctured . Insertion force data were collected using the NANO17 sensor , ﬁ ltered with an in - built 2nd order and 5 . 1 kHz low - pass anti - aliasing ﬁ lter , and acquired at 100 Hz via a data acquisition card ( NI PCI - 6220 , National Instruments ) . Simultaneously , the displacement of the Z - axis linear actuator was recorded by the GUI software . Lastly , the needle was retracted out of brain tissues at the same velocity as used for insertion and moved to another entry point on the other hemisphere to create a un - puncture position . The sequence was repeated 10 times . Between each insertion , the needle was rinsed with deionized water . Totally , 5 ex - vivo porcine brains were used for pre - puncture needle insertion experiments . 2 . 3 . 2 Indentation stress relaxation tests If the radially punched brain tissues around the probe were unfolded with its axis as the center onto a plane tangent to its sidewall , the transverse dimension of the punched area perpendicular to longitudes would equal the perimeter of the probe . Corresponding to the transverse dimension ( ~ 5 . 0 mm ) of punched brain tissues by the Ø1 . 5 mm coaxial probe , an Ø5 . 0 mm ﬂ at - ended stainless - steel cylindrical indenter was appropriate for indentation stress relaxation tests to investigate viscoelastic mechanical properties of the six regions . Note that the average punched velocity along the contour of the hemispherical tip in the radial direction equaled probe insertion velocity in the longitudinal direc - tion . During post - puncture insertion , the velocity of 5 mm / s was still implemented by that neurosurgeon , so all inden - tions were performed at 5 mm / s . Six regions along the planned trajectory of the 5 mm - thick slices were tested in random orders . Firstly , the Ø5 . 0 mm indenter was attached to the NANO17 sensor and randomly brought into delicate contact with the surface of a region to achieve 3 mN tare load . Then , the Ø5 . 0 mm indenter was displaced down 0 . 75 mm at 5 mm / s and held therein for 20 s . Reaction force data during the indentation and the subsequent hold period were collected by the NANO17 sensor . The force data were acquired at 500 Hz . Simultaneously , the displacement of the Ø5 . 0 mm indenter was recorded by the GUI software . The sequence was implemented once on each slice . If necessary , the aCSF could be dripped on the slices to prevent dehydration . All indentation stress relaxation tests were performed at room temperature and completed within 6 h of sacri ﬁ ce to mini - mize postmortem effects [ 34 ] . 2 . 4 Data analysis 2 . 4 . 1 Mechanical modeling of elastic properties in pre - puncture insertion For a pressure distribution corresponding to a ﬂ at - ended cylindrical indenter , the relationship between load and displacement of the surface relative to the specimen free surface is [ 35 – 37 ] F ð u Þ ¼ 2 E (cid:2) R ′ u ð 1 Þ F ( u ) is insertion force in pre - puncture , R ′ is the radius of the ﬂ at - ended stainless - steel cylindrical needle , u is the needle displacement in pre - puncture insertion , E * is the combined modulus of the needle and brain tissues given by [ 37 ] : 1 E (cid:2) ¼ 1 (cid:3) ν ′ 2 E ′ þ 1 (cid:3) ν 2 E ð 2 Þ E ′ , ν ′ , E , and ν describe the elastic moduli and Poisson ’ s ratio of the needle and brain tissues , respectively . The stiffness of the stainless - steel needle is far higher than brain tissues , so Eq . ( 2 ) can be expressed in terms 163 Page 4 of 12 J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2016 ) 27 : 163 of Eq . ( 3 ) . 1 E (cid:2) ¼ 1 (cid:3) ν 2 E ð 3 Þ The Poisson ’ s ratio ν is assumed 0 . 5 for incompressible brain tissues [ 16 , 19 , 20 , 22 ] . Substituting Eq . ( 3 ) into Eq . ( 1 ) gives Eq . ( 4 ) . As shown in Eq . ( 5 ) , the Young ’ s modulus ( E ) of brain tissues can be calculated from the slope ( K ) of the force – displacement response of the needle in pre - puncture insertion .

P ¼ 4 κ R δ G 1 (cid:3) ν ð 6 Þ P is the reaction force , R is the ﬂ at punch radius , δ is the indentation depth , G is shear modulus , and ν is the Pois - son ’ s ratio of brain tissues . In this paper , the relative indentation depth de ﬁ ned as the indentation depth divided by the smaller of the indenter radius or the slice thickness is 0 . 3 and exceeds the range ( 0 . 01 ~ 0 . 2 ) proposed by Finan et al . [ 39 ] . Consequently , the stronger weighted correction factor κ which equals 1 . 947 is adopted according to the study of Hayes et al . [ 38 ] . To capture the time - dependent mechanical behavior along the total temporal scale , a Boltzmann hereditary integral in which G ( t ) for each region is calculated and convolved with the velocity pro ﬁ le of the indenter is used to describe the total load trace of the corresponding region [ 16 , 20 ] .

The initial guesses for each τ j are chosen to re ﬂ ect behavior at different temporal scale ( i . e . , tens of ms , hundreds of ms , and seconds , etc . ) . The instantaneous modulus is calculated as the sum of G ∞ and G j . Equation ( 8 ) is substituted into Eq . ( 7 ) , then P ( t ) is used to determine the parameters of G ( t ) with 95 % con ﬁ dence intervals by ﬁ tting the solution of Eq . ( 7 ) to the average load trace in each region using nlin ﬁ t . m in MATLAB R2013a . To make balance of the weight between the short ramp and the long relaxation for ﬁ ttings , the raw data during the relaxation are re - sampled with a continuously decreasing sampling rate strategy , in which the number of omitted points between two selected points increases one until the end of the dataset . The same ﬁ tting procedure is repeated for load data of each region . G 10 ms , G 150 ms , G 2 s , G 20 s and G ∞ of each region are calculated using the Prony series parameters for the six regions . 2 . 5 Statistical analysis An F - test is used to determine the optimal number of Prony terms to suf ﬁ ciently capture the relaxation behavior of each region [ 22 ] . Statistical analysis is performed in SPSS . Each indentation is conducted in a different position within each region of each slice , so each is considered an independent measurement for statistical purposes . For all tests , a p - value < 0 . 05 is considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Multiple com - parisons of shear moduli ( G 10 ms , G 150 ms , G 2 s , G 20 s , and G ∞ ) obtained from the Prony series parameters are implemented with Student ’ s t tests with Bonferroni - corrected p value [ 40 ] , where p = 0 . 05 / number of comparisons ( 0 . 0033 ) . For each region , a logarithmically spaced distribution of 55 data points from 0 to 100 s ( when relaxation is assumed to reach equilibrium ) is calculated from normalized Prony series parameters . These six distributions are then compared using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov statistic [ 40 ] with Bonferroni - corrected p values . 3 Results 3 . 1 Elastic properties of brain tissues in pre - puncture insertion As shown in Fig . 3a , needle force almost increases linearly with the needle displacement in pre - puncture insertion . The peak on the force pro ﬁ le at the moment of puncture can be used to identify puncture events . Because of physiological variations among brain tissues beneath entry points of dif - ferent porcine brains , dimpling depth of each insertion differs . Therefore , the portion on each force pro ﬁ le J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2016 ) 27 : 163 Page 5 of 12 163 exceeding the minimal dimpling depth ( 3 . 12 mm based on 10 measurements of needle insertion ) should not be employed to calculate the average insertion force . Figure 3b shows the trace of the average insertion force with needle displacement before 3 . 12 mm in pre - puncture insertion , along with ﬁ tting lines using a linear polynomial ( 9 ) and a second order polynomial ( 10 ) processed by nonli ﬁ t . m in MATLAB R2013a . The r 2 values are up to 99 % and 99 . 4 % , respectively . The insert depicts the residuals between the average insertion force and the ﬁ tting lines . The residuals ﬂ uctuate between ± 1 mN with the similar ﬂ uctuating modes . F ð u Þ ¼ 8 : 088 u (cid:3) 0 : 1596 0 < u < 3 : 12 ð 9 Þ F ð u Þ ¼ 0 : 6426 u 2 þ 6 : 053 u þ 0 : 8564 0 < u < 3 : 12 ð 10 Þ The slope of polynomial ( 9 ) is constant 8 . 088 , whereas the slope of polynomial ( 10 ) increases slightly with needle displacement ( k = 2 × 0 . 6426 u + 6 . 053 , 0 < u < 3 . 12 ) . Thus , substituting the values of slope into Eq . ( 5 ) gives the Young ’ s modulus of brain tissues in pre - puncture insertion . A linear polynomial ( 9 ) gives a constant Young ’ s modulus of 4 . 044 kPa . A second order polynomial ( 10 ) gives Young ’ s modulus E ( u ) = 0 . 6426 u + 3 . 027 , 0 < u < 3 . 12 , ranging from 3 . 027 kPa to 5 . 032 kPa . Note that , Young ’ s modulus obtained from a linear polynomial ( 9 ) equals the mean value of Young ’ s modulus obtained from a second order polynomial ( 10 ) . 3 . 2 Viscoelastic properties of brain tissues in post - puncture insertion Figure 4 shows a representative of the average load trace of RG 1 along with the ﬁ tting line calculated from the her - editary integral . The load trace consists of a quickly increasing ramp stage and a dramatically decaying relaxa - tion stage . The ramp stage requires 150 ms to reach the indentation depth of 0 . 75 mm . The corresponding load data with peak magnitude of ~ 29 mN are recorded for ﬁ tting at short temporal scales when brain tissues on the insertion path are punched from the probe tip onto the sidewall along the contour of the tip . The load data relax quickly during the consequent 20 s hold period , but equilibrium is never achieved . The load data during the 20 s hold period are used for ﬁ tting at long temporal scales of the following probe insertion , pause , and retraction . The residuals between the load trace and the ﬁ tting line ﬂ uctuate between ± 2 mN at the short ramp portion , but stabilize at the consequent relaxation stage , as shown in the insert . The F - test shows that three decay terms in Prony series are suf ﬁ cient to optimally capture the relaxation behavior of Fig . 3 a .

Equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) are used to ﬁ t the Prony series parameters to the average load trace of each region . Generated Prony series parameters with 95 % con - ﬁ dence intervals are listed in Table 1 , with R 2 values ran - ging from 93 . 8 % to 98 . 1 % . The high R 2 values suggest that the linear viscoelastic model is capable of accurately describing the stress relaxation behaviors of tested regions . Substitute the generated Prony series parameters into Eq . ( 8 ) , shear relaxation moduli of each region along the total time history ( 0 , + ∞ ) can be calculated . Shear relaxa - tion moduli of the six regions during the ramp and the hold stages are plotted in Fig . 5a . Shear relaxation moduli decay dramatically from the beginning of the indentation . As demonstrated in the inset , shear relaxation moduli of the six regions decay by 41 % ~ 63 % before 20 ms . Equilibrium is either never truly achieved . These signi ﬁ cant time - depen - dent effects indicate that brain tissues are viscoelastic . Figure 5b shows statistical comparisons between the Prony series approximations for each region , according to the Kolmogorov – Smirnov statistic . The statistic takes into account of the magnitudes and the time - dependent changes in shear moduli . It is a useful tool to analyze signi ﬁ cant differences of different regions . Pairwise comparisons reveal that the six regions can be classi ﬁ ed into three categories , according to the regional shear moduli : super - ﬁ cial brain tissues ( Ctx and CR ) , regions close to lateral ventricle ( RG 1 and RG 2 ) , and the thalamus ( Sth and Dth ) . Within each category , tissues have no signi ﬁ cant difference . However , signi ﬁ cant differences exist between categories . Regions close to lateral ventricle are signi ﬁ cantly stiffer than super ﬁ cial brain tissues which are in turn stiffer than the thalamus . Note that 10 ms , 150 ms , 2 s , and 20 s are crucial moments of probe insertion during the STN - DBS surgery . Mechanical traumas of impacted brain tissues will occur within a short time scale of tens of milliseconds [ 22 ] . Brain tissues directly beneath the probe tip will be just impacted onto the sidewall at 150 ms . Most of the decay in shear relaxation moduli occurs before 2 s . Shear relaxation moduli almost reach pseudo - equilibrium at 20 s . Therefore , G 10 ms , G 150 ms , G 2 s , and G 20 s of each region are calculated by substituting the Prony series parameters into Eq . ( 8 ) . The results together with G ∞ are shown in Fig . 6a . Some signi ﬁ cant differences between regions obtained using Post - hoc comparisons are illustrated in Figs . 6b , c . Shear relaxation moduli of each region at these crucial moments also decrease quickly , indicating the viscoelastic behaviors of brain tissues . In accordance with statistical comparisons according to the Kolmogorov – Smirnov sta - tistic , the regional moduli at the ﬁ ve moments can also be classi ﬁ ed into three identical categories . Regional differ - ences at 10 ms are the same as those at 150 ms . Regional differences still exist at long time scales , although values of shear relaxation moduli become lower .

Insertion forces in pre - puncture are attributed to the elastic properties of the intact capsule and brain tissues below [ 29 , 30 ] . Besides , the average dimpling depth of the 10 measurements of needle insertion was 4 . 7 mm . Compared with the dimension of adult porcine brains ( Fig . 2 ) , the insertion depth was a small deformation [ 38 ] . Therefore , pre - puncture insertion of a Φ 1 . 5 mm needle into a porcine brain satis ﬁ es small loads to stay within the limits of the small - strain assumption [ 36 , 38 ] . Furthermore , 10 measurements of the Φ 1 . 5 mm needle insertion were performed at a high velocity of 5 mm / s . The corresponding insertion time for 3 . 12 mm insertion depth was only 0 . 6 s . As shown in Fig . 6a , at the crucial relaxation time of 2 s , the stress relaxation behaviors are still obvious . For a short period as compared to some characteristic relaxation time , brain tissues will exhibit instantaneous elastic responses similar to an elastic solid [ 41 ] . Therefore , pre - puncture insertion can be regarded as instantaneous indentations and the Young ’ s moduli of brain tissues in pre - puncture are valuable to investigate the instantaneous elastic responses of brain tissues . In previous studies , Okamura et al . [ 30 ] and Kobayashi et al . [ 42 ] found that the needle force in pre - puncture insertion into soft biological tissues showed non - linear increase with insertion depth and the trace in pre - puncture could be best ﬁ tted by a second order polynomial . However , their insertion depths and corresponding insertion time were greater than those in this paper . Okamura et al . performed their insertions at a slow velocity of 3 mm / s and their puncture depths were more than 12 mm . Kobayashi et al . initially inserted the needle at a slower velocity of 1 mm / s and their puncture depths were more than 5 mm . In this paper , the ﬁ tting goodness of a simple linear polynomial is enough . To clarify the differences of the two ﬁ ttings , both a linear polynomial and a second order poly - nomial are introduced into the ﬁ tting process . It is clear from Fig . 3b that both ﬁ tting lines can perfectly describe the average force trace . The two ﬁ ttings have almost identical r 2 values and residuals . Here , both a linear polynomial and a second order polynomial are suitable for ﬁ tting the average insertion force in pre - puncture . Therefore , the Young ’ s moduli of brain tissues in pre - puncture insertion obtained from the slope of a linear polynomial or a second order polynomial are worthy of trust to apply in ﬁ nite element models . The two kind results can be applied to modeling linearly elastic or nonlinearly elastic assumption of brain tissues , respectively . If some slower velocities are employed in pre - puncture insertion , it is probable that needle force in pre - puncture will increase nonlinearly with insertion depth . If so , a linear polynomial is not capable of describing the average force trace . However , a second order polynomial is still suitable for ﬁ tting the average insertion force in pre - puncture . Thus , the Young ’ s moduli of brain tissues in pre - puncture insertion can be obtained from the slope of a second order polynomial . Although the previous results of Young ’ s moduli vary signi ﬁ cantly due to different loading environment and species , they can act as references to verify the reliability of Young ’ s moduli obtained in this paper . The Young ’ s modulus calculated from a linear polynomial ( 9 ) agrees Fig . 6 a .

[ 19 ] . Subbaroyan et al . [ 18 ] also indented rat brains using a ﬂ at - ended cylindrical punch and computed the Young ’ s modulus as 5 . 51 ± 0 . 3832 kPa , which was a little larger than results of our studies . Nagashima et al . [ 43 ] obtained Young ’ s moduli of gray and white matter of feline brains and proposed the values of 4 . 0 kPa and 8 . 0 kPa , respectively . Entire porcine brains can be considered as composites of gray and beneath white matter , and Young ’ s moduli in pre - puncture insertion in this paper comply with their results . In post - puncture insertion of the STN - DBS surgery , all brain tissues along the implanting trajectory experience an instantaneous step punch in the radial direction along the contour of the probe tip and a subsequent hold period on the sidewall of the guide cannula with further probe insertion . Standard viscoelastic mechanical behaviors will appear in the process . Prange et al . [ 31 ] concluded that gray matter was primarily isotropic . Nicolle et al . [ 32 ] looked at direc - tional differences of corona radiata and found its anisotropy low . To reduce inter - sample variability , slice orientation during harvesting and testing was consistent . The results can also be applied to mechanical properties of brain tissues in other orientations . As shown in Figs . 5 and 6 , both region and time sig - ni ﬁ cantly affect the viscoelastic behaviors , which is con - sistent with observations in the literature [ 16 , 20 , 22 , 28 , 32 ] . The values of shear relaxation moduli obtained using adult porcine brains in our study are lower than results using adult rat brains by Finan et al . [ 16 ] . Regional differences still exist at long time scales , which is in accordance with reports of Elkin et al . [ 20 ] . In this paper , the regional and dynamic viscoelastic property of brain tissues within the tested regions can be directly employed to investigate brain tissue - probe interaction during the post - puncture insertion . The signi ﬁ cant effect of region indicates that the stiffness of brain tissues on the implanting trajectory is inhomo - geneity . According to the courses and regional differences of shear relaxation moduli , regions on the planned trajectory are classi ﬁ ed into three categories : super ﬁ cial brain tissues ( soft regions , Ctx and CR ) , regions close to lateral ventricle ( stiff regions , RG 2 and adjacent RG 1 ) , and the thalamus ( softer regions , Dth and Sth ) . Though Ctx is gray matter and CR is white matter , there are no signi ﬁ cant differences in stiffness , which is consistent with the results of Elkin et al . [ 20 ] . Thus , the increase of insertion force will keep steady with insertion depth within the two regions . It is not imperative to change probe insertion strategies when their interface is encountered by the tip . Regions close to lateral ventricle are the stiffest , so internal puncture may occur when the interface of CR and RG 2 is penetrated , as demonstrated by Okamura et al . [ 30 ] . Excessive brain tissue shift may be caused at the internal puncture moment . If vascular structures or lateral ventricle system displace to the implanting trajectory , intracerebral hemorrhage or leakage of cerebrospinal ﬂ uid will be caused . Therefore , internal puncture event can act as signal of arriving at RG 2 and attention should be paid to brain tissue shift . There are no signi ﬁ cant differences in stiffness between RG 2 and RG 1 , so they can be considered as the same region . When the probe tip comes to the interface of the stiffer RG 1 and the softer Dth , energy of probe insertion should be reduced . There are no signi ﬁ cant differences in stiffness between Dth and sth , so they can also be considered as the same region . The signi ﬁ cant effect of time indicates that the stiffness is dynamic and softens with time . High values of shear relaxation moduli before 150 ms are associated with brain tissue resistance to the hemispherical tip insertion . They can be used to investigate high - rate mechanical response of brain tissue to probe tip insertion and corresponding acute injury ( edema or disruption of nervous tissues ) [ 7 ] . The following decay values are relevant to subsequent events on the sidewall of the guide cannula with further probe inser - tion . They are appropriate for modeling clamping forces arising from brain tissues due to compression away from the insertion path , friction forces caused by shear action between brain tissues and the guide cannula , as well as chronic injury ( in ﬂ ammation and astroglial scar ) caused by micromotion around the de ﬁ nitive DBS electrode [ 8 , 44 ] . It should be note that the shear relaxation moduli of brain tissues passed by the probe tip will decay to lower values during the slipping process from the rostral to the caudal portion of the guide cannula . On the contrary , brain tissues just punched onto the sidewall still have higher shear relaxation moduli . Figure 7a illustrates the uneven dis - tribution of shear relaxation moduli at a moment when the probe is just inserted into the region of Sth . It takes ~ 150 ms for brain tissues beneath the probe tip slipping onto the rostral node of the guide cannula along the tip contour , so these brain tissues still own higher shear relaxation moduli ( G 150 ms ) . However , brain tissues of other regions have relaxed for a period . Thus , their shear relaxation moduli will decay to lower values ( < G 2 s ) . The further the distance to the rostral node is , the lower the shear relaxation moduli are . Therefore , the stress of brain tissues along the sidewall will dramatically decrease from the rostral to the caudal portion . The uneven distribution is consistent with the phenomenon proposed by DiMaio et al . [ 45 ] . That is the peak of insertion force exists at the rostral portion of a probe and the plateau exists at its caudal portion . Note that this uneven distribu - tion is mainly attributed to time - dependent viscoelastic mechanical behavior of brain tissues but not only tissue cutting . No brain tissues will slip onto the sidewall of the guide cannula when probe insertion pauses . Shear relaxation J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2016 ) 27 : 163 Page 9 of 12 163 moduli of all brain tissues on the implanting trajectory will decay to lower values . Moreover , after a long period of subsequent surgical process such as MER , shear relaxation moduli of all regions will decay to their equilibrium as demonstrated in Fig . 7b . The stress distributed on the sidewall of the guide cannula at equilibrium is lower and relatively consistent . The convex part on the distribution curve is due to higher values of G ∞ for stiffer RG 2 and RG 1 . It is clear that the area under the curve in Fig . 7a is more than that in Fig . 7b . Hence , the energy cost in probe insertion is larger than that cost in probe retraction . This ﬁ nding can be used to interpret the fact that insertion force and its slope of pro ﬁ le are larger than those of retraction force as illustrated by Andrei et al . [ 46 ] and Jensen et al . [ 10 ] . 5 Conclusions Depending on their individual loading conditions and brain tissue responses , elastic and viscoelastic mechanical prop - erties of brain tissues in pre - puncture and post - puncture insertion are investigated through pre - puncture needle insertion experiments and indentation stress relaxation tests , respectively . The following conclusions are obtained : 1 . In pre - puncture , insertion forces of the Ø1 . 5 mm needle almost increase linearly with needle displace - ment at the velocity of 5 mm / s . Both a linear polynomial and a second order polynomial can perfectly ﬁ t the average insertion force . A constant Young ’ s modulus ( E ) of 4 . 044 kPa is calculated from the slope of a linear polynomial ﬁ tting line . An expression E ( u ) = 0 . 6426 u + 3 . 027 ( 0 < u < 3 . 12 ) is obtained from the slope of a second order polynomial ﬁ tting line . Compared with previous studies , both results are worthy of trust to be applied in ﬁ nite element models to investigate the instantaneous elastic responses of brain tissues in pre - puncture insertion based on linear or nonlinear assumption , respectively . 2 . For post - puncture insertion , shear relaxation moduli of all regions on the planned trajectory are calculated from the Prony series parameters . Shear relaxation moduli of each region follow their individual courses along the total time history . Based on the Kolmo - gorov – Smirnov statistic and Post - hoc comparisons between shear relaxation moduli , regional and temporal heterogeneity of brain tissues on the planned trajectory is revealed . 3 . The six regions along the planned trajectory can be classi ﬁ ed into three categories in stiffness : super ﬁ cial brain tissues ( soft regions , Ctx and CR ) , regions close to lateral ventricle ( stiff regions , RG 1 and RG 2 ) , and the thalamus ( softer regions , Sth and Dth ) . These differences can be used to optimize probe insertion strategies for heterogeneous brain tissues . Attention should be paid when the interface between categories is penetrated . Note that brain tissue shift may occur at the interface of CR and RG 2 , due to possible internal puncture caused by dramatic increase of stiffness . 4 . The stiffness decreases dramatically in short time scales but the equilibrium is never truly achieved . Higher values in short time scales can be used to investigate high - rate mechanical response to probe tip insertion and consequent acute injury . Lower values in long time scales are appropriate for modeling clamping forces , friction forces , and chronic injury with further probe insertion , pause , and retraction . Moreover , the stress along the sidewall decreases quickly from the rostral to the caudal portion during probe insertion , which can interpret the phenomenon that insertion force and its slope of pro ﬁ le are larger than those of retraction force .
