IMAGING IN CELL BIOLOGY SEPTEMBER 2003 | S7 The discovery and development of fluorescent proteins from marine organisms are revolu - tionizing the study of cell behaviour by pro - viding convenient markers for gene expression and protein targeting in intact cells and organ - isms ( see also the review on page S1 of this supplement ) 1 , 2 . The most widely used of these fluorescent proteins — green fluorescent pro - tein ( GFP ) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria 3 — can be attached to virtually any protein of interest and still fold into a fluorescent molecule . The resulting GFP chimaera can be used to localize previously uncharacterized proteins 4 or to visualize and track known proteins to further understand cellular events 5 . The use of GFP as a minimally invasive tool for studying protein dynamics and func - tion has been stimulated by the engineering of mutant GFPs with improved brightness , photostability and expression properties 2 , 6 , 7 . Cells that express proteins tagged with these GFPs can be imaged with low light intensities over many hours and so can provide useful information about changes in the steady - state distribution of a protein over time . Time - lapse imaging alone , however , cannot reveal a protein’s kinetic properties ( for example , whether it is freely diffusing , bound to an immobile scaffold , or undergoing binding with and dissociation from other compo - nents ) . Yet , it is these kinetic properties that are arguably of most interest , as they underlie protein function within cells . In this review , we discuss two techniques — photobleaching and photoactivation — that , when combined with time - lapse imaging , can uncover the kinetic properties of a protein by making its movement observable 2 , 7 – 11 . Photobleaching — the photo - induced alter - ation of a fluorophore that extinguishes its fluorescence — accomplishes this through flu - orescence depletion within a selected region . Photoactivation , on the other hand , works by converting molecules to a fluorescent state by using a brief pulse of high - intensity irradia - tion . After fluorescently highlighting specific populations of molecules by either method , the fluorescent molecules can be followed as they re - equilibrate in the cell . The extent and rate at which this occurs can be quantified and used with computer - modelling approaches to describe the kinetic parameters of a protein . Photobleaching and photoactivation : following protein dynamics in living cells Jennifer Lippincott - Schwartz , Nihal Altan - Bonnet and George H . Patterson Cell biology is being transformed by the use of fluorescent proteins as fusion tags to track protein behaviour in living cells . Here , we discuss the techniques of photobleaching and photoactivation , which can reveal the location and movement of proteins . Widespread applications of these fluorescent - based methods are revealing new aspects of protein dynamics and the biological processes that they regulate . REVIEW S8 | SEPTEMBER 2003 www . nature . com / focus / cellbioimaging R E V I E W S Photobleaching techniques Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching . Developed over two decades ago to study the diffusive properties of molecules in living cells 12 – 17 , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) has experienced a resurgence due to the introduction of GFP and the development of commercially avail - able confocal - microscope - based photo - bleaching methods 8 , 11 , 18 . In this technique , a region of interest is selectively photo - bleached with a high - intensity laser and the recovery that occurs as molecules move into the bleached region is monitored over time with low - intensity laser light ( FIG . 1a ) . Depending on the protein studied , fluores - cence recovery can result from protein diffusion , binding / dissociation or transport processes . Analysis of fluorescence recovery can be used to determine the kinetic parameters of a protein , including its diffusion constant , mobile fraction , transport rate or binding / dissociation rate from other proteins . In experiments in which the protein of interest moves freely , the fluorescence will recover to the initial prebleach value and the shape of the recovery curve can be described mathe - matically with a single component recovery ( FIG . 1b , single ) 19 – 22 . Determining the effec - tive diffusion coefficient ( D eff ) and mobile fraction ( M f ) of a protein from such data is relatively straightforward , given the previ - ous analysis of FRAP kinetics 12 ( for several recent reviews , see REFS 8 , 11 , 18 , 23 ) . If the shape of the curve is complex ( that is , it requires a multi - component diffusion equation 20 , 24 , 25 ) , then multiple populations of the molecule with differing diffusion rates are present ( FIG . 1b , complex ) . This can occur when a molecule undergoes binding and release from intracellular components or exists as a monomer and multimeric forms 10 . Alternatively , the protein might not be diffusing but might be undergoing movement driven by molecular motors or membrane tension flow . A simple test for determining whether a fluorescent protein moves by diffusive movement or facilitated transport is to vary the size of the bleached area or beam radius , ω . The recovery will change with an ω 2 dependence for diffusive movement only 26 . Accurate analysis of FRAP data requires that the bleach event is much shorter than the recovery time and preferably as short as possible . Moreover , the recovery event must be monitored until a recovery plateau is achieved , which is much greater than the half - time for recovery . See TABLE 1 for other FRAP considerations . 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Complex Single Time F l u o r e s ce n ce b a Photobleach Photobleach 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Time F l u o r e s ce n ce c Photobleach Immobilefraction Mobilefraction 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 50 100 150 200 250 Time F l u o r e s ce n ce d Photobleach Photobleach Fullrecovery Figure 1 | Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching . a | A cell expressing fluorescent molecules is imaged with low light levels before and after photobleaching the strip outlined in red . Recovery of fluorescent molecules from the surrounding area into the photobleached region is monitored over time . Analysis usually includes compensation for the reduction in whole - cell fluorescence ( depicted in the bottom cartoons ) . b | Fluorescence recovery into the photobleached region can be quantified in a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) curve . These plots depict the recovery for a single species ( simulated by a single exponential curve shown in yellow circles ) or the kinetics for two equal populations recovering at two different rates ( simulated by a double exponential curve shown in orange circles ) . Note that the kinetics for recovery of the latter takes much longer to plateau . c | The level of fluorescence recovery in the photobleached region reveals the mobile and immobile fractions of the fluorophore in the cell ( see main text for details ) . d | A simple test for photo - induced immobile fractions is to perform a second FRAP experiment in the same region of interest . In the example here , the mobile fraction of the initial FRAP experiment is ~ 70 % . The level of recovery can be determined by normalizing the fluorescent signal in the region and repeating the FRAP experiment . In the absence of photodamage , full recovery should be observed . R E V I E W S highlighted and followed over time . Using cyan fluorescent protein ( CFP ) - and yellow fluores - cent protein ( YFP ) - tagged β - actin , monomer versus filamentous actin dynamicswas demon - strated 38 , and actin transport was monitored during cell protrusion 39 . In another study , CFP - and YFP - tagged histone H2B molecules were co - expressed in cells undergoing mitosis 40 . After one pool of the YFP - containing H2B molecules was photobleached , the movement of the non - photobleached pool was used to monitor chromosome positions throughout the cell cycle . Fluorescence loss in photobleaching . Com - plementary to the photobleaching techniques discussed earlier , the continuity of a cell com - partment can be monitored using a technique called fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) ( FIG . 2b ) . In a FLIP experiment , a fluo - rescent cell is repeatedly photobleached with - in a small region while the whole cell is repeatedly imaged . Any regions of the cell that are connected to the area being bleached will gradually lose fluorescence due to lateral Performing FRAP . Until recently , carrying out FRAP required custom - built systems to per - form the measurements . Development of FRAP methods for use on the laser - scanning confocal microscope has made this technique widely available . Images on the confocal microscope are obtained by scanning a focused laser beam across the specimen and recording the emitted fluorescence through a pinhole that is situated in front of the light detector . One way to photobleach using this system is to define a region - of - interest at the highest possible ZOOM , set the laser power to maximum , and set the laser ATTENUATION to zero . The high zoom increases the dwell time of the laser on the bleached region per line scan ( laser intensity increases proportionally to the square of the zoom factor ) , which therefore greatly increases the radiation per area . But a more advanced method is to use an acousto - optical tunable filter ( AOTF ; avail - able on more recent commercially available confocal microscopes ) , which allows rapid ( microsecond to millisecond ) attenuation of the laser as it scans a field . By allowing rapid switching between the bleaching and normal beam , the AOTF allows accurate measure - ments of diffusion rates in defined areas . Use of an AOTF also enables users to photobleach virtually any pattern or shape . This allows FRAP studies to be done on organelles of complex shapes , allowing the lateral mobility of organelle - specific mem - brane and lumenal proteins to be investigated . Selective photobleaching on a confocal micro - scope also provides a method for analysing aspects of protein dynamics other than diffu - sion ( including assembly / disassembly of pro - tein complexes in cells , the exchange of cytosolic proteins on and off organelles , and the lifetime and fate of membrane - bound transport intermediates 27 – 30 ( FIG . 2a ) . This type of analysis often requires measuring the fluo - rescence signal of GFP in a specific structure or area , to compare it with fluorescent intensities of other structures or areas . Once the quanti - ties of fluorescent molecules in different sites or states are known , computer modelling can then be used to determine the parameter values ( that is , the rate constants for binding interactions and exchange times ) of the processes of interest 10 . Recent applications in which kinetic modelling has been used suc - cessfully include analysing the dynamics of nuclear proteins 31 – 35 , protein transport through membrane trafficking pathways 27 , 36 , 37 and membrane coat protein dynamics 30 . Inverse FRAP . Inverse FRAP ( iFRAP ) is per - formed as a normal FRAP experiment with the exception that the molecules outside a region of interest are photobleached and the loss of fluorescence from the non - photo - bleached region is monitored over time . As opposed to the rate of recovery studied using a FRAP experiment , iFRAP offers a way to monitor the rate of movement out of a region . For example , iFRAP was used to monitor the dissociation kinetics of GFP - tagged RNA polymerase I components from sites of rRNA transcription 34 . Because this method indirectly highlights a pool of mole - cules by decreasing the background fluores - cence , it has also been used to follow Golgi to plasma membrane transport carriers as they moved from the Golgi and fused with the plasma membrane 27 , 37 ( FIG . 2c ) . Fluorescence localization after photobleaching . Fluorescence localization after photobleach - ing ( FLAP ) 38 also indirectly highlights a pool of molecules . For a FLAP experiment , the same protein - of - interest is tagged with two different fluorophores that co - localize when expressed in cells . By photobleaching one of these fluorophores , a selected pool can be IMAGING IN CELL BIOLOGY SEPTEMBER 2003 | S9 Table 1 | FRAP considerations Problem Potential explanations References Lack of recovery Possible explanations include : an immobile fraction of 8 or partial recovery unbleached molecules in the cytoplasm that could not diffuse after photobleach into the bleached region ; an immobile fraction of molecules in the bleached area that was unable to exchange with the incoming unbleached molecules ; or the bleached area is not continuous with the rest of the cell ( for example , a separate membrane compartment ) . Reversible The excitation might cause the GFP molecule to flicker or to 86 photobleaching be sequestered in a triplet state . Both of these situations can of GFP result in the recovery of fluorescence ( in milliseconds to several seconds ) of the GFP molecule in the absence of diffusion . To control for any reversible photobleaching of the GFP in a FRAP experiment , the FRAP conditions should be repeated in fixed samples in which no recovery of fluorescence should be expected . Or , alternatively , the bleach spot size could be varied and the changes in the timescale of recovery could be confirmed . Non - diffusive Measurements in FRAP studies are often complicated by the 10 , 30 behaviour binding and dissociation of fluorescent molecules to and from intracellular components . This is usually reflected in the FRAP curves by longer recovery times , by an incomplete recovery ( an immobile fraction ) or by the presence of several slopes ( indicating several recovery processes over different timescales ) . Kinetic modelling methods , along with computer simulations , have been useful tools to dissect and analyse the recovery curves obtained by FRAP . A kinetic model is characterized by biophysical parameters , such as binding and release rate constants , diffusion constants , flow rates and residence times . The model can be simulated on the computer for different parameter values . Once the parameters that best fit the experimental data have been determined , the predictions of the model can be tested experimentally . D values of the same A potential explanation is damage to the photobleached area . 87 ROI in the same cell Decreasing the bleach time , acquisition time or the excitation in two consecutive beam intensity during the recovery period could avoid experiments damaging the cell .

S10 | SEPTEMBER 2003 www . nature . com / focus / cellbioimaging R E V I E W S yeast showed that it continuously binds to and dissociates from a plasma - membrane - localized scaffold molecule , Ste5 . After being activated at the plasma membrane when bound to Ste5 , Fus3 rapidly relocates to the nucleus by diffu - sion . The spatial localization of Fus3 activation and its dynamics at the plasma membrane are thought to help control and amplify MAPK signalling . A second example from yeast is the behaviour of septins — small GTPases that recruit proteins to form a ring at the cleavage site during cell division . Using FRAP , GFP - tagged septins in yeast were shown to be mobile during most of the cell cycle but then to become immobilized at the cleavage site at the time of budding 48 . This leads to the recruitment of other proteins to this site , and thereby creates a diffusion barrier between mother and daughter cells 49 . So , by changing between mobile and immobile states , septins help to control the temporal and spatial regulation of cytokinesis . Protein dynamics in the nucleus . FRAP measurements of GFP - labelled nuclear pro - teins have revealed that many compartments in the nucleus — including nucleoli , Cajal bodies and splicing - factor compartments — are not stable entities but are steady - state assemblies of proteins that undergo continu - ous association and dissociation 31 – 35 . The diffu - sion of proteins ( including HMG17 , SF2 / ASF , fibrillarin , coilin and TBP ) and the U7 small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) in these subnuclear compartments are significantly lower ( D eff between 0 . 24 – 0 . 53 µ m 2 sec – 1 ) than reported for freely diffusing peptides , GFP molecules or fluorescently labelled dextrans ( ≥ 2 µ m 2 sec – 1 ) 46 , 50 . This indicates that exchange into and out of subnuclear compartments is the rate - limiting factor for the movement of these proteins and snRNA within the nucleus . In addition to providing insights into the dynamics of subnuclear structures , FRAP studies of the nucleus have revealed the kinetics of the binding of transcription - factor machinery to DNA promoters 51 , 52 , the intra - nuclear mobility of messenger RNA 53 and the geography of chromosomes 40 , 54 . Intra - and inter - organelle dynamics . The micro - environment within organelles and the exchange of components between organelles have also been probed using FRAP . One example is the mitochondrial matrix , which has traditionally been thought of as too dense to allow the rapid movement of its compo - nents . However , FRAP measurements of the GFP - tagged matrix enzyme cytochrome oxidase c revealed that this small enzyme diffuses extremely rapidly in mitochondria 55 . cellular compartments and their components , and are illuminating regulatory features of signalling and transport pathways . Protein dynamics in the cytoplasm . The cyto - plasm contains numerous macromolecular assemblies and cytoskeletal elements ( including microtubules , actin and interme - diate filaments ) . Yet , it has only recently become clear from FRAP studies that small molecules can rapidly diffuse through this system and bind reversibly to dynamic scaf - folds . Such studies have shown that molecules up to 200 kDa undergo unhindered diffusion through the cytoplasm with D eff values several times lower than those found in water 43 , 44 . By contrast , larger molecules ( > 200 kDa ) or macromolecular complexes have impeded diffusion , presumably due to the extensive cytoskeletal meshwork of cells 44 – 46 . These diffusional properties have recently been shown to participate in the spatial organi - zation and activity of signalling pathways . One example is the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . FRAP studies 47 that examined the dynamics of the MAPK Fus3 in movement of mobile proteins into this area . By contrast , the fluorescence in unconnected regions will not be affected . In addition to assessing continuity between areas of the cell , FLIP can be used to assess whether a protein moves uniformly across a particular cell com - partment or undergoes interactions that impede its motion 28 , 36 , 41 . Furthermore , it can be used to reveal faint fluorescence in uncon - nected compartments that normally cannot be seen against the bright fluorescence that arises in other parts of the cell 42 . Photobleaching applications Photobleaching techniques that are applied to live - cell imaging are transforming our understanding of cellular organization and dynamics . For the first time , the mobility of diverse molecules in the cytoplasm , nucleus , organelle lumens and membranes of living cells can be measured , and the viscosity of these environments analysed . Moreover , resi - dent components of organelles , once thought to be stable , have been shown to continuously enter and exit these structures . These findings are defining the biophysical characteristics of I Golgi M b c Pre - bleach 4 7 14 a Pre - bleach Bleach ROI Post - bleach 20 min 35 min 50 min Figure 2 | Photobleaching of GFP - tagged proteins to monitor dynamics . a | The Golgi complex ( blue outline ) was photobleached in a cell expressing galtase – GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) in the presence of cycloheximide and the recovery was monitored over time ( post - bleach image = time 0 ) . The observed recovery indicated galtase – GFP resident in the Golgi undergoes continuous exchange with non - Golgi pools ( such as those in the endoplasmic reticulum ) during its lifetime . b | Fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) of galtase – GFP in interphase and mitotic cells . A boxed area spanning an interphase and a metaphase cell was repetitively photobleached with high - intensity laser light over time . After each photobleach , an image of the entire field was scanned with low - intensity laser light . The number of bleach cycles is indicated in each panel . Note that in a metaphase cell , unlike in interphase , the galtase – GFP fluorescence is rapidly lost after 14 cycles of photobleaching ( see Movie 1 online ) . This indicates that it is in a continuous compartment in which it can rapidly diffuse .

The transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein ( VSV - G – GFP ) in membrane - bound carriers from the Golgi to the plasma membrane was visualized by photobleaching a region of interest , which included the whole cell except the Golgi complex . After the photobleach , the export of GFP - tagged VSV - G – GFP from the Golgi complex could be imaged with low laser light ( arrows ) ( see Movie 2 online ) .

R E V I E W S identity of which depends on continuous protein exchange with the cytoplasm and ongoing membrane input / output pathways . Finally , photobleaching techniques have provided a powerful method for highlighting transport intermediates as they move along specific membrane - trafficking pathways 27 , 37 , 69 , 70 ( FIG . 2b ) and for analysing the dynamics of the protein - trafficking machinery 29 , 30 , 40 , 71 . Studies of GFP - tagged components of membrane - trafficking machinery that sorts cargo into membrane - bound transport intermediates have shown that they undergo continuous binding to and dissociation from membranes irrespective of vesicle budding . By contrast , components of the large macro - molecular assemblies that comprise the fatty acid β - oxidation pathway were immobilized , presumably through associations with the inner mitochondrial membrane 56 . Based on these findings , it is thought that the clus - tered assemblies of proteins that are immo - bilized in the mitochondrial matrix provide a surface on which highly mobile substrates and enzymes can interact 55 , 56 . FRAP has also unveiled important charac - teristics of the ER lumen , which is enriched in molecules that are involved in protein biogen - esis , folding and assembly . Under normal conditions , small soluble proteins can diffuse rapidly throughout the ER lumen with access to all areas 42 , 57 . However , under conditions of cell stress — such as heat shock , change in osmolarity , calcium depletion , a glycosyla - tion block or the production of unfolded proteins 42 , 58 – 60 — there are marked changes in the mobility of proteins and lumenal conti - nuity . So , the ER lumen is not a stable envi - ronment , but undergoes significant global changes in response to cell stress , which could affect its numerous cellular roles . FRAP techniques have been crucial for characterizing the mobility of GFP - tagged proteins that are embedded in organelle bilayers . The measured D eff for many trans - membrane proteins localized in the ER , Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane have values ranging from 0 . 2 to 0 . 5 µ m 2 sec – 1 with little or no immobile fractions 41 , 42 , 61 . This indicates that these proteins have unhindered lateral mobility in the membranes of these com - partments . By contrast , large assemblies of membrane proteins in the ER ( for example , translocons , TAP transporters and nuclear pores ) or plasma - membrane proteins inter - acting with the extracellular matrix or cortical cytoskeletal elements , diffuse more slowly or have large immobile fractions 25 , 60 , 62 – 65 . Studies of the diffusion properties of these molecules have important implications for understand - ing how proteins are retained in different membrane - bound compartments , and what mechanisms coordinate the processing and transport functions of membranes . For instance , alterations in TAP1 – GFP D eff under different peptide loads have provided evidence of TAP - complex conformational changes and interactions with class I major histocompat - ibility complex ( MHC ) molecules during peptide translocation 25 , 66 . Additionally , FRAP experiments performed on the lamin - B receptor at various points during the cell cycle show that although the receptor is immobile in the nuclear envelope during interphase , it disperses to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and is completely mobile during mitosis 67 . Organelles of the secretory pathway , including the Golgi apparatus , have tradition - ally been thought to contain relatively stable resident components . But recent studies using FRAP techniques have revealed that membrane - bound and peripherally associated Golgi - resident proteins associate only transiently with this organelle 68 . Whereas transmembrane enzymes can reside in the Golgi for up to 1 – 2 hours before recycling to the ER , peripherally associated coat and matrix proteins on the Golgi exchange with the soluble pools in the cytoplasm every 30 – 60 seconds . These results indicate that the Golgi apparatus is a highly dynamic organelle , the IMAGING IN CELL BIOLOGY SEPTEMBER 2003 | S11 a Photoactivate b Photoactivate c Photoactivate Figure 3 | Photoactivation of fluorescent proteins . a | Before photoactivation , cells expressing photo - activatable proteins display little fluorescence in the spectral region that is used for detecting enhanced fluorescence . After photoactivation of a selected region ( indicated in red ) , an increase in fluorescence is observed . By directly highlighting specific populations of molecules , such as the nuclear pool of the fluorophore , the movement from this region throughout the cell can be monitored . b | Alternatively , the entire cell can be photoactivated and the fate of the fluorescence followed over time . Because newly synthesized proteins are not detected nor photoactivated during the imaging experiment , photoactivatable fluorescent proteins circumvent this possible artefact and might allow the fate of fluorescently tagged proteins to be monitored by ‘optical pulse labelling’ . c | Photoactivation of a single cell or population of cells can be used to monitor cell lineage within a developing organism . S12 | SEPTEMBER 2003 www . nature . com / focus / cellbioimaging R E V I E W S lineage or movement in a developing organism can be monitored by imaging the fluorescence dispersion after photoactivation of a single cell or subpopulation of cells 81 ( FIG . 3c ) . So , these proteins have remarkable promise to complement and extend the range of present fluorescent - protein imaging applications . Concluding remarks The battery of fluorescent proteins and imaging tools that allow us to monitor protein dynamics in living cells continue to provide numerous new insights into the behaviour of proteins , organelles and cells . In so doing , they have ushered in a new era of cell biology in which kinetic microscopy methods can be used to decipher pathways and mechanisms of biological processes . The microscopy tech - niques of photobleaching and photoactivation are perhaps the most versatile and widely used of these methods . Their ability to alter the fluo - rescence steady state without perturbing protein dynamics offers unprecedented oppor - tunities for obtaining quantitative information about protein concentrations , diffusion rates , binding kinetics and protein lifetimes in single live cells , which have been indiscernible using traditional biochemical approaches . Such information is paramount to understanding how biological processes unfold , are regulated and interact in the living cell . Looking to the future , photobleaching and photoactivation will almost certainly continue to provide important new results as their applications are extended by the development of newer instruments that push the limits of temporal and spatial detection , and by the dis - covery of brighter and differently coloured fluorescent proteins . For example , FRAP can be combined with other microscopic imag - ing approaches , including two - photon microscopy 84 , ( see MULTI - PHOTON MICROSCOPY ) or TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION microscopy 85 , to study events at specific sites in the cell . And , photo - bleaching or photoactivation can be combined with fluorescence energy - transfer techniques 2 , 8 to study protein interactions with greater pre - cision . These advances will continue to require computational approaches to comprehend the plethora of quantitative experimental data 10 , as well as new database tools for the analysis of specific models and their relationship to other more complex models .

All of these molecules share the common characteristic of displaying low levels of fluo - rescence before photoactivation and higher levels after photoactivation . In a typical experi - ment , a cell or organism that is expressing the photoactivatable fluorescent protein is imaged at one wavelength prior to , and at various intervals after , photoactivation of a selected region with a different wavelength . However , the properties of each protein , including the wavelengths used for imaging and photoacti - vation , offer distinct advantages and disadvan - tages . For example , PA - GFP and Kaede both require ~ 400 nm light for photoactivation , whereas KFP1 uses green light ( 532 nm ) , which is probably better for use with living cells . Kaede displays a remarkable 2 , 000 - fold increase in its red - to - green fluorescence ratio , but the use of both the red and green fluores - cence bands could make multilabel experi - ments problematic . On the other hand , the green fluorescence of Kaede is bright enough to visualize the localization of the non - photoactivated proteins easily , whereas visual - izing PA - GFP and KFP1 is more problematic due to their low fluorescence before photo - activation . The self - association properties of Kaede and KFP1 into tetrameric forms limit their usefulness as protein fusion tags because tetramerization might perturb parent protein localization and trafficking . The recent engineering of the DsRed protein into a monomeric form 82 is encouraging for the possibility of the eventual disruption of Kaede and KFP1 into monomers . Variants that are derived from A . victoria , such as PA - GFP , self - associate to a lesser degree , and even those interactions can be disrupted by one of three further point mutations 83 . Because of this , PA - GFP can be used as a reliable tag for creat - ing fluorescent reporter molecules . The ability to ‘switch on’the fluorescence of the photoactivatable proteins makes them excellent tools for exploring protein behav - iour in living cells . As the fluorescence of these proteins comes only after photoactivation , newly synthesized non - photoactivated pools are unobserved and do not complicate experi - mental results ( FIG . 3a ) . This signal indepen - dence from new protein synthesis could allow the study of protein degradation of tagged molecules by ‘optical pulse labelling’ and monitoring of the fluorescence over time ( FIG . 3b ) . Photoactivation of these proteins is generally rapid and gives stable fluorescence signals . Therefore , they can be used to exam - ine various kinetic properties of tagged pro - teins , such as their D eff , M f , compartmental residency time and exchange . Lastly , cell These include COPII ( Sec23 / Sec24 and Sec13 / 31 heterodimers assembled onto ER membranes with the small GTPase , Sar1 ) , COPI ( a heptameric cytosolic protein com - plex recruited to Golgi membranes ) , Arf1 ( a small GTPase ) and clathrin ( a major struc - tural constituent forming the lattice around clathrin - coated vesicles ) . Whether this exchange represents a ‘proof - reading’mech - anism for ensuring proper loading of coated vesicles , or is necessary for lateral membrane differentiation into pleiomorphic transport intermediates 72 , remains to be investigated . In either case , the kinetics of this exchange have major implications for models of coat protein function and of the GTP binding and hydrolysis cycles of Arf1 and Sar1 . Photoactivation Photoactivation is the photo - induced activa - tion of an inert molecule to an active state . It is generally associated with the ultraviolet - light - induced release of a caging group from a ‘caged’ compound . Photoactivation of CAGED COMPOUNDS in the study of living cells is reviewed elsewhere 73 , so our discussion is limited to recent advances in the develop - ment of genetically encoded photoactivatable fluorescent proteins . Included in the development and discov - ery of new fluorescent protein variants 2 , 6 , 7 ( see also the review on page S1 of this supplement ) were attempts to produce photoactivatable fluorescent proteins . These studies yielded several molecules or tech - niques for optically highlighting proteins , but each had drawbacks for use in living cells , such as modest activation 74 , 75 , low stability 76 or a requirement for low oxygen conditions 77 , 78 . Recently , three photoactivatable fluorescent proteins — photoactivatable GFP ( PA - GFP ) 79 , Kaede 80 and kindling fluorescent protein 1 ( KFP1 ) 81 — have been reported that offer improvements over the earlier versions . The PA - GFP 79 was developed with the aim of optimizing the photoconversion properties of Aequorea victoria wtGFP 74 , which produces only a ~ threefold increase in fluorescence under 488 nm excitation . Mutation of threo - nine 203 to histidine in wtGFP to produce PA - GFP decreases the initial absorbance in the minor peak region ( ~ 475 nm ) and leads to ~ 100 - fold increase after photoactivation 79 . Alternatively , for the Kaede protein , isolated from Trachyphyllia geoffroyi , photoactiva - tion results in a 2 , 000 - fold increase in its red - to - green fluorescence ratio 80 .

Following the advent of indirect immuno - fluorescence during the 1960s , fluorescence microscopy has become an indispensable tool for localizing proteins in fixed specimens , and it often complements in vitro analyses of mol - ecular mechanisms . The recent availability of a wealth of new vital markers for fluorescence microscopy 1 also allows defined molecular species to be conveniently labelled and , there - fore , molecular assays to be carried out in live cells . In particular , green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) can be used to visualize virtually any protein in live cells 2 , and a large number of GFP variants are now available , which have different spectral properties 3 and allow simultaneous detection of multiple tagged proteins 4 ( see also the review on page S1 of this supplement ) . When highly dynamic and spatially com - plex structures , such as live cells and organisms , are imaged , a more complete representation is achieved by recording the data in three spatial dimensions over time ( four - dimensional ( 4D ) imaging ) 5 – 10 . This generates complex data , typically consisting of thousands of indi - vidual image slices , which can occupy several gigabytes of storage space per experiment . Such data require dedicated computational tools for their quantitative analysis . Here , we review typical 4D acquisition systems , important considerations for 4D experi - ments , and image - processing procedures for visualization and quantitation ; in addition , we highlight the applications of this emerging approach in cell biology . Acquiring 4D sequences General considerations for 4D imaging . The fundamental consideration for any 4D live - cell imaging device is to keep the specimen alive during the acquisition of 100 – 10 , 000 images over a long period . A suitable and stable environment has to be provided , ensuring a constant temperature and a stably buffered culture medium . After this , the other signifi - cant concern in 4D imaging is the limited number of photons available to acquire fluo - rescence images from each cell . This is due to the limited number of fluorescent molecules that can be introduced into a cell at physio - logical concentrations and the limited photon yield before oxidation — which terminates fluorescence — for each fluorophore . Excessive illumination will lead to loss of signal by photobleaching and is toxic for cells ( see PHOTOTOXICITY ) . Therefore , excitation light is typically kept to a minimum in 4D experi - ments , which frequently results in a subop - timal signal - to - noise ratio and a lower spatial resolution when compared with images of fixed specimens . So , for each biological application , it is crucial to find a suitable compromise between sufficient , but not toxic , illumination , spatial resolution in the x , y and z axes , temporal resolution and the signal - to - noise ratio , so that the maximum number of acceptable images can be acquired before the specimen is completely photo - bleached or damaged . In some cases , a single z slice ( 2D time - lapse recording ) can yield the best results — for example , when the struc - ture of interest is flat and when there are no marked deformations along the z axis during the experiment . In this case , the lower number of frames in 2D time - lapse imaging would yield a better signal - to - noise ratio and a better time resolution , making it favourable to 4D imaging . Furthermore , when imaging dynamic processes in 4D , each of these para - meters might change during the experiment and should be adjusted interactively . A good illustration of this is 4D imaging of chromosome dynamics in mitotic cells ( FIG . 1 ) . For such an experiment , the time lapse would need to be shortened during more dynamic phases , such as congression — the rapid movement of chromosomes to the spindle equator in prometaphase — and then pro - longed during the stable metaphase orienta - tion . The number of z slices necessary is low in prophase , when the cell is still flatly attached to the substrate , and is increased when it rounds up in metaphase ( see the side view in FIG . 1d , e ) . In addition , 4D experiments often run for hours or days to record a biological process such as one cell cycle . Therefore , automatic 4D recording with application protocols on 4D microscopes that can autofocus , track cell movements and revisit multiple - stage loca - tions to follow several cells in parallel can markedly increase throughput and repro - ducibility of 4D imaging . Fluorescence microscopes for 4D imaging . The main difference to conventional epifluores - cence microscopy is that 4D imaging requires rapid and reproducible sectioning along the optical axis ( z axis ) . Ideally , the acquisition time for each z stack should be small com - pared with the time lapse between the acquisition of individual stacks to avoid movements within each 3D data set . In addition , the z positions have to be highly reproducible over time , through many stacks , to avoid drifts . Z stepping ( the movement 4D imaging to assay complex dynamics in live specimens Daniel Gerlich and Jan Ellenberg A full understanding of cellular dynamics is often difficult to obtain from time - lapse microscopy of single optical sections . New microscopes and image - processing software are now making it possible to rapidly record three - dimensional images over time . This four - dimensional imaging allows precise quantitative analysis and enhances visual exploration of data by allowing cellular structures to be interactively displayed from many angles . It has become a key tool for understanding the complex organization of biological processes in live specimens . REVIEW
