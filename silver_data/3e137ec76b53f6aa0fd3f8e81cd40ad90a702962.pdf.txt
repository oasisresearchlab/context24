These proteins include clathrin , clathrin - interacting proteins , actin binding proteins , and peripheral membrane proteins such as F - BAR proteins . Many questions remain regarding the interac - tions of these proteins , particularly the participation of F - BAR proteins in the assembly of actin ﬁlaments . Results : Our microscopic and genetic interaction experiments on ﬁssion yeast show that F - BAR proteins Cdc15p and Bzz1p accumulate in two distinct zones on invaginating membrane tubules and interact with Myo1p and Wsp1p , nucleation - pro - moting factors for Arp2 / 3 complex . The two F - BAR proteins peak prior to movement of the actin patch and their accumula - tion in actin patches depends on the nucleation - promoting factors . At their peak local concentrations , we estimated the stoichiometries of the proteins in actin patches to be one Bzz1p per two Wsp1p and one Cdc15p per Myo1p . Puriﬁed Bzz1p has two SH3 domains that interact with Wsp1p and stimulate actin polymerization by Arp2 / 3 complex . Cells lack - ing either Cdc15p or Bzz1p assemble 3 - to 5 - fold less actin in patches ( in spite of normal levels of Wsp1p , Myo1p , and Arp2 / 3 complex ) , and patches move shorter distances from the plasma membrane . Conclusion : We propose that during clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis , F - BAR proteins interact with nucleation - promoting factors to stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex in two different zones along the invaginating tubule . We further propose that poly - merization of actin ﬁlaments in these two zones contributes to membrane scission . Introduction Cells use endocytosis to take up nutrients and internalize cell surface molecules . Yeasts rely mainly on clathrin - dependent mechanisms for endocytosis , whereas animal cells also use other mechanisms [ 1 – 4 ] . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in - volves recruitment of proteins to a site where the plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off a vesicle . Fluores - cence microscopy documented the time course of assembly of many of these proteins in yeast [ 5 ] . Inmammaliancells , scissionofanendocyticvesicledepends on the GTPase dynamin , which accumulates at the neck of the membrane invagination [ 6 ] . Budding and ﬁssion yeast encode three dynamin homologs , but none localize in actin patches [ 5 ] . Some studies showed that the budding yeast dynamin homolog Vps1p interacts with Sla1p and that D vps1 mutants accumulate depolarized actin aggregates and fail to internalize membrane receptors [ 7 , 8 ] . Other studies reported that deletion ofVps1pdidnotaffectendocytosisortheultrastructureofactinpatchesinbuddingyeast [ 5 , 9 ] or ﬁssion yeast [ 10 ] . Both yeasts depend on actin polymerization to generate tubularinvaginations oftheplasmamembraneatsitesofendo - cytosis [ 9 ] . Actin assembly is also important in clathrin - depen - dent , caveolin - dependent , and clathrin - and caveolin - inde - pendent endocytosis in animal cells [ 1 , 11 – 15 ] . Mammalian cells use the same proteins to make both small clathrin - coated pits independent of the actin cytoskeleton and larger clathrin - coated plaques that require actin cytoskeleton [ 16 ] . In all care - fully studied systems , actin assembly during endocytosis depends on Arp2 / 3 complex and its nucleation - promoting factors [ 5 , 13 , 17 – 19 ] . Some early endocytic proteins such as Pan1 , Sla2 , Hip1 , Hip1R , proteins of the BAR superfamily ( amphiphysin , SNX9 , Toca1 , Cip4 , and FBP17 ) , and dynamin associate with both membrane lipids and components of the actin cytoskeleton . These interactions link the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton [ 6 , 20 – 22 ] , but the connections between actin polymerization and membrane reorganization are less well understood than actin assembly . We used quantitative ﬂuorescence microscopy to study the roles of F - BAR proteins Bzz1p and Cdc15p during endocy - tosis in ﬁssion yeast . Mutations in the bzz1 + gene or depletion of Cdc15p impaired endocytosis and assembly of actin ﬁla - ments in patches in spite of normal accumulation of WASp ( Wsp1p ) , myosin - I ( Myo1p ) , and Arp2 / 3 complex . Cdc15p assembled stoichiometrically with Myo1p , whereas Bzz1p assembled stoichiometrically with and activated Wsp1p . These features , as well as genetic interactions , lead us to propose that these two F - BAR proteins set up separate zones of actin assembly on tubular necks connecting coated pits to the surface membrane . Results F - BAR Proteins of Schizosaccharomyces pombe The Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome contains seven genes encoding F - BAR domains ( see also Figure S1 available online ) , a domain highly conserved from amoebas to mam - mals in the ‘‘pombe Cdc15 homology’’ ( PCH ) family of proteins . Previous work characterized six S . pombe F - BAR pro - teins , Cdc15p [ 23 ] , Bzz1p [ 24 ] , Imp2p [ 25 ] , Rga7p [ 26 – 28 ] , Rga8p [ 29 ] , and Rga9p [ 29 ] . Open reading frame ( ORF ) SPBC12C2 . 05c bzz1 + [ 24 ] groups with Saccharomyces cerevisiae bzz1 [ 30 ] on a phylogenetic tree of F - BAR domains ( Figure S1A ) . Uncharacterized S . pombe ORF SPBC4C3 . 06 grouped with S . cerevisiae , suppressor for yeast proﬁlin 1 , syp1 , so we named SPBC4C3 . 06 syp1 + . Figure 1 and Figure S1 illustrate the domain architecture of these proteins . The cdc15 + gene is essential for viability [ 23 ] , but strains with single dele - tions of the genes for ﬁve other F - BAR proteins were viable ( Table 1 ) . We did not attempt to isolate a D rga9 strain . * Correspondence : thomas . pollard @ yale . edu We expressed all seven F - BAR proteins fused with a mono - meric ﬂuorescent protein from their native loci under the control of their endogenous promoters . Cdc15p was tagged on the N terminus [ 31 ] , whereas the monomeric ﬂuorescent protein was fused to the C termini of the other proteins . All of the strains depending on F - BAR proteins tagged with mNFPs were viable and grew normally ( Figure S1J ) . Syp1p is associ - ated with early stages of endocytosis , Cdc15p and Bzz1p are associated with actin patches , and each of the other four F - BAR proteins had a unique temporal and spatial distribution in cells ( Figures 1A and 1B ; Figures S1B – S1I ; Table 1 ) . Cdc15p is unique among these proteins , because it participates in both endocytosis and cytokinesis [ 23 , 32 ] ( Figure 1A ; Figure S1B ) . Similar to S . cerevisiae Bzz1p , S . pombe Bzz1p - mNFP con - centrated in punctate structures at the tips of cells that we conﬁrmed to be actin patches by colocalization of Bzz1p - mEGFP with the actin patch markers ﬁmbrin or coronin tagged with mCherry ( Figure 1B ; data not shown ) . Our study focused on actin patches , so we tested whether mEGFP - tagged Cdc15p and Bzz1p were functional by crossing these strains with mutants that exhibit synthetic interaction phenotypes when combined with mutations of the cdc15 + or bzz1 + genes ( Table 2 ; see below ) . The mEGFP - Cdc15p fusion protein was functional because a genetic cross between mEGFP - cdc15 and a D wsp1 strain produced viable D wsp1 cells expressing mEGFP - Cdc15p . mEGFP - Cdc15p localized to actin patches and contractile rings in D wsp1 cells ( Figure S1K ) . Our failure to generate D myo 1 mutant cells expressing Bzz1p - mEGFP revealed that Bzz1p - mEGFP was not fully functional , but an endocytosis assay with FM4 - 64 showed that cells depending on Bzz1p - mEGFP took up the ﬂuorescent dye as well as wild - type cells ( Figure S1M ) . Bzz1p tagged on its N terminus was less functional , because mEGFP - Bzz1p expressed from the native locus failed to localize to the actin patches ( Figure S1L ) , and crosses with D myo1 cells produced only two or three viable spores . Time Course of Cdc15p and Bzz1p Assembly in Actin Patches Time - lapse microscopy of live cells expressing ﬂuorescent fusion proteins established the timing of the accumulation and disappearance of Cdc15p and Bzz1p in actin patches compared with tagged Wsp1p , Myo1p , and coronin Crn1p ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . We used the ﬂuorescence intensity of actin patches in cells expressing single ﬂuorescent fusion proteins to measure the numbers of molecules at 1 s time inter - vals [ 33 , 34 ] ( Figures 1C and 1D ; Figures S2E – S2H and S2M ) . We used two criteria to align all of the measured proteins on the same timescale : the initial movement of patches was deﬁned as time zero , and for patch components such as Myo1p and Cdc15p that did not move , we conﬁrmed their relative positions over time by imaging strains expressing a pair of ﬂuorescent proteins tagged with mYFP and mCFP ( Figures S2A – S2D ) . Bzz1p - mEGFP and mEGFP - Cdc15p appeared in , peaked , and disappeared from actin patches over w 10 s ( Figure 1D ; Figures S2E and S2F ) . The two proteins remained together in actin patches until they reached their peak concentrations and then began to separate . Myo1p peaked at w 170 ( 6 36 ; one standard deviation ) molecules w 2 s earlier than Cdc15p , but their numbers were equal when Cdc15p peaked at about 130 ( 6 27 ) molecules ( Figure 1D ; Figures S2F and S2G ) . Both Cdc15p and Myo1p were stationary as their numbers declined ( 0 . 05 6 0 . 07 m m and 0 . 03 6 0 . 04 m m from the origin ) ( Figures Cdc15p Myo1p Merge A F - BAR SH3 Cdc15p B Bzz1p Fim1p Merge 3 H S F - BAR Bzz1p 3 H S 20 0 Time [ s ] f o r eb m u N h c t ap r ep s e l u c e l o m 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Crn1p Myo1p Wsp1p Cdc15p Bzz1p - 15 - 10 - 5 0 5 10 15 D 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 ] m [ D S M 2 Crn1p Wsp1p Cdc15p Myo1p Bzz1p - 15 - 10 - 5 0 5 10 15 20 Time [ s ] E C Cdc15p Wsp1p Myo1p - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Crn1p - 6 - 4 - 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 s Bzz1p 8 s Figure 1 .

Wsp1p peaked at w 140 ( 6 16 ) molecules w 1 s before Bzz1p peaked at w 75 ( 6 15 ) molecules ( Figures 1C and 1D ; Figures S2H and S2E ) . Like Wsp1p ( 0 . 42 6 0 . 06 m m from the origin ) and verprolin Vrp1p , Bzz1p moved a short distance as it dissipated ( 0 . 25 6 0 . 03 m m from the origin ) ( Figures 1C and 1E ; Figures S2L and S2I ) [ 35 ] . Genetic Interactions among Activators of Arp2 / 3 Complex Wsp1p and Myo1p deﬁne two independent pathways of actin assembly at sites of endocytosis in vivo , with either path - way being sufﬁcient for cell viability [ 35 , 36 ] . To test genetic interactions with activators of Arp2 / 3 complex , we used a temperature - sensitive ( ts ) cdc15 + mutant ( cdc15 - 127 ) and a bzz1 + deletion mutant with the ura4 + gene replacing the entire bzz1 + ORF . Cells lacking Bzz1p were shorter than wild - type cells at 25 (cid:1) C and grew slower than wild - type cells at higher temperatures ( Table 2 ) . We generated double - mutant strains D bzz1 D wsp1 , cdc15 - 127 D wsp1 , and cdc15 - 127 D myo1 , but failed to generate D bzz1 D myo1 , suggesting that D bzz1 is synthetically lethal with D myo1 ( Table 2 ) . The cdc15 - 127 D wsp1 strain failed to grow at temperatures greater than 25 (cid:1) C , suggesting that cdc15 - 127 is synthetically lethal with D wsp1 ( Table 2 ) . Both the D wsp1 and D myo1 strains carried a complementing plasmid to assist in these crosses . Interactions of Bzz1p and Cdc15p with Nucleation - Promoting Factors In Vivo We isolated mutants to test the roles of Cdc15p and Bzz1p in endocytosis . The cdc15 + gene is essential , so we replaced the endogenous promoter with a thiamine - repressible nmt1 pro - moter [ 41 3 ] to allow thiamine to repress the level of Cdc15p 50 - fold from 12 m M to 0 . 2 m M in wild - type cells ( Figure S3A ) . An endocytosis assay showed that both Bzz1p and Cdc15p are required for normal uptake of a lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 ( Fig - ure 2A ) . We used a pulse - chase design , where a cold temper - ature blocked endocytosis while the plasma membrane was labeled by exposing cells to 20 m M FM4 - 64 dye for 15 min . Raising the temperature to 25 (cid:1) C on the microscope stage rein - itiated endocytosis , which we followed over time by ﬂuores - cence microscopy . Mutant D bzz1 and 41xnmt1cdc15 cells took up FM4 - 64 much slower than wild - type cells : by 15 min , 85 % of wild - type cells but none of the D bzz1 cells and only 15 % of 41xnmt1cdc15 cells concentrated the dye in the vacu - olar membranes ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Cells lacking Bzz1p or depleted of Cdc15p had serious defects in actin patch movement ( Figure 2C ) even though these patches contained normal amounts of Myo1p , Wsp1p , and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 2I – 2K ; Figures S3G – S3O ) . In wild - type cells , actin patches marked with coronin Crn1p - mEGFP moved persistently away from the plasma membrane ( Figures 2C and 2D ; Figure S3B ) , whereas coronin moved only w 300 nm in cells lacking Bzz1p ( Figure 2C ; Figure S3C ) , Wsp1p ( Figure 2C ; Figure S3F ) , or Myo1p ( Figure 2C ; Fig - ure S3F ) or depleted of Cdc15p ( Figure 2C ; Figure S3D ) . Furthermore , 38 % of patches in D bzz1 cells ( n = 24 patches ) and 19 % of patches in 41xnmt1cdc15 cells ( n = 32 patches ) stalled or retracted back to the plasma membrane after moving a short distance ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . Actin patches in cells without Bzz1p or depleted of Cdc15p assembled only 20 % – 33 % as much GFP - actin as in wild - type cells ( Figure 2L ; Figures S3P – S3R ) . GFP - tagged actin cannot replace native actin in ﬁssion yeast [ 33 , 37 ] , so we ex - pressed GFP - actin from the leu + locus in the genome under thecontrolofan nmt1 promoter ( mediumstrength 41xnmt1 pro - moter in D bzz1 cells and a strong 3xnmt1 promoter in 41xnmt1cdc15 cells ) . Thiamine repressed Cdc15p expression in 41xnmt1cdc15 cells , as evident from the phenotype , but the 3xnmt1 promoter allowed the cells to express about the same Table 1 .

Control experiments veriﬁed that expression of low levels ofmNFP - actindidnotalterthemorphologyofthecells , interfere with the formation of actin cables or contractile rings , or inter - fere with the dynamics of other patch components tracked with CapBp ( Figures S3U and S3V ) . Bzz1p SH3 Domains Bind Wsp1p and Stimulate its Nucleation - Promoting Activity We used domain deletion mutants to study the roles of the two Bzz1p SH3 domains in actin polymerization in cells . Bzz1p lacking one or both of the SH3 domains was tagged with mYFP at the C terminus and expressed at near wild - type levels from the bzz1 + locus ( Figure S4A ) . Bzz1p lacking a single SH3 domain accumulated in actin patches , which assembled 34 % less GFP - actin ( 268 molecules ) than wild - type cells ( 407 molecules ) ( Figure 3B ) . Bzz1p D SH3 D SH3 lacking both SH3 domains did not accumulate in actin patches ( Figure 3A ) , and these patches assembled only 81 molecules of GFP - actin , similar to D bzz1 cells ( Figure 3B ) . Equilibrium binding assays showed that both SH3 domains of Bzz1p contribute to binding S . pombe Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) . Puriﬁed S . pombe Wsp1p poly ( p ) - verprolin - central domain - acidic region of WASp ( VCA ) ( residues 129 – 574 including the polyproline domain and VCA ) bound glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - Bzz1p - SH3SH3 with both SH3 domains with a much higher afﬁnity ( K d w 0 . 1 m M ) ( Figure 3C ) than GST - Bzz1p - SH3 with just the C - terminal SH3 domain ( K d w 2 m M ) ( Figure 3D ) . Neither GST nor GST - Cdc15p - SH3 bound Wsp1p poly ( p ) - VCA ( data not shown ) . Actin polymerization assays showed that dimers of Bzz1p - SH3 domains stimulate the ability of Wsp1p poly ( p ) - VCA to activate Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . Puriﬁed S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex had little effect on the time course of spontaneous assembly of muscle actin even in the presence of 500 nM monomeric Wsp1p poly ( p ) - VCA with or without a monomeric construct consisting of the two Bzz1pSH3 ( Fig - ure 3E ) . On the other hand , the combination of Arp2 / 3 com - plex with monomeric Wsp1p poly ( p ) - VCA and dimeric GST - Bzz1pSH3 stimulated actin polymerization nearly as well as Arp2 / 3 complex with dimeric GST - Wsp1p poly ( p ) - VCA . The rate of actin polymerization reached a maximum with 1 m M GST - Bzz1pSH3 and 0 . 5 m M Wsp1p poly ( p ) - VCA ( Figure 3F ) . Myo1p Tail Is Required to Recruit Cdc15p to Patches Experiments with deletions from the tail of Myo1p showed that the tail homology domain 2 ( TH2 domain ) of Myo1p is required to localize Cdc15p in actin patches , in agreement with the pre - vious evidence from yeast two - hybrid and biochemical and immunoprecipitation assays [ 32 ] . We crossed cells expres - sing Cdc15p - mEGFP with D myo1 cells complemented with COOH - terminal deletion mutants of Myo1p known to localize to actin patches and rescue the growth and mating defects of D myo1 [ 36 ] . Cdc15p - mEGFP concentrated in actin patches with similar time courses in wild - type cells ( 8 – 12 s ) and cells depending on Myo1p - H / 1 / 2 / 3 ( myo1 D A , lacking the C - terminal A motif ) or Myo1p - H / 1 / 2 ( myo1 D 3A lacking the C - terminal TH3 domain and A motif ) ( Figure S4C ) . However , Cdc15p - mEGFP failed to concentrate in patches of cells lack - ing Myo1p or depending on Myo1p without tail domains TH2 , TH3 , and A ( myo1 D 23A ) ( Figure 3G ) , forming only a few spots that did not change in ﬂuorescence intensity over time ( Figure S4D ) . While full - length Cdc15p - mEGFP persisted in patches for 8 – 12 s , small numbers of Cdc15p - mGFP lacking the single C - terminal SH3 domain ( Cdc15p D SH3 - mEGFP ) accumulated in patches for only w 3 s ( Figure S4E ) in spite of being ex - pressed at a wild - type level from the endogenous promoter ( Figure S4B ) . This behavior conﬁrmed that the SH3 domain is required to concentrate Cdc15p in actin patches but not contractile rings [ 38 ] . Fic1p interacts with the SH3 domain of Cdc15p , colocalizes with Cdc15p during interphase and in mitosis , and copuriﬁes with clathrin heavy chain , a component of the actin patch [ 38 ] . Further work will be required to under - stand the role of Fic1p in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and its contribution to the function of Cdc15p . Discussion Localization and deletion of all seven F - BAR proteins and detailed analysis of two of these proteins suggest that each F - BAR protein has a distinct function in yeast cells , even along the pathway of clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 23 – 29 , 38 ] . Remarkably , one F - BAR protein , Cdc15p , has distinct roles in both endocytosis and cytokinesis [ 32 ] . The functional speciﬁcity of these proteins depends on unique properties of their F - BAR domains , which have very diverse amino acid sequences beyond the conserved amino acids . For example , long stretches of amino acids unique to Cdc15p link the a helices of the F - BAR domain . Spatial and temporal variations in the lipid composition of ﬁssion yeast plasma membrane may inﬂuence the distributions of Cdc15p , Rga7p , and Rga8p to different parts of the cell during the cell cycle . Rga7p and Rga8p also include Rho GTPase activating protein domains at their C termini and are localized to the cell tips during inter - phase and equatorial region during cell division . Steps in Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis Endocytosis in ﬁssion and the budding yeasts shares many common features , some with parallels in animal cells . Both yeasts require actin polymerization to form tubular invagina - tions of plasma membrane against turgor pressure [ 9 , 39 ] . Fluorescence microscopy of live budding and ﬁssion yeast cells [ 5 , 35 ] and electron microscopy of budding yeast [ 9 ] provided enough quantitative information [ 40 ] to formulate and test a mathematical model of actin assembly and turnover at sites of endocytosis [ 41 ] . In both yeasts , endocytosis occurs in at least three steps [ 1 – 4 ] ( Figure 4 ) . We use the actin patch timescale of Sirotkin et al . [ 40 ] with time zero deﬁned as the time when actin patch components move away from the plasma membrane . Cells initiate endocytosis more than a minute before time zero by concentrating F - BAR protein Syp1p ( both yeasts ) or FCHo1 / 2 ( animals ) locally in the plasma membrane [ 42 – 45 ] . The F - BAR domains of these proteins bind PIP 2 and demark the membrane for a new endocytic event . By time 2 30 s , an early module of proteins , consisting of clathrin ( Clc1p and Chc1p ) , an Eps15 homology ( EH ) - domain containing pro - tein Ede1p ( in budding yeast ) , and adaptor proteins Pan1p and End4p ( Sla2p in budding yeast ) , assemble on shallow ( < 50 nm ) invaginations of the plasma membrane [ 40 , 42 , 45 ] with the clathrin coat occupying about 30 nm at the tip of the invagination [ 9 ] . Syp1p and Ede1p disappear near the onset of actin polymerization [ 42 , 43 ] , whereas clathrin remains associated with the invaginating membrane .

Current Biology Vol 21 No 17 1454 During the second step beginning at time 2 11 s , nucleation - promoting factors Wsp1p and Myo1p start to accumulate fol - lowed by F - BAR proteins Bzz1p and Cdc15p ( Figure 1D ) . These four proteins promote assembly of actin ﬁlaments by Arp2 / 3 complex starting at time 2 6 s . We show that ﬁssion yeast require an F - BAR protein in addition to Arp2 / 3 complex and either Wsp1p or Myo1p [ 35 ] for actin polymerization , patch movement , and uptake of FM4 - 64 . The movement of patch components in budding yeast corresponds to invagination of a narrow tubule of plasma membrane into the cytoplasm [ 9 ] . Given the similarity of the process in the two fungi , we assume that this applies to ﬁssion yeast . The movement of actin patches in budding yeast depends on both the Arp2 / 3 com - plex activation and motor activity of type I myosins [ 18 ] . The numbers and locations of proteins associated with actin patches provide the basis to predict the structures formed by the F - BAR proteins . F - BAR domains bind to lipid bilayers and induce membrane tubulation or assemble helical structures around tubular membranes [ 46 ] . A membrane tubule 57 nm in diameter can accommodate eight F - BAR dimers around its circumference , so the peak number of 80 Bzz1p molecules would wrap around the tubular invagination ﬁve times and occupy as little as 20 nm along the length of the tubule . Elec - tron micrographs suggested that the F - BAR domains of Cdc15p might be as long as 30 nm [ 47 ] , so the peak number of 130 molecules might wrap w 8 times around the membrane invagination . These two zones of F - BAR proteins are not re - solved by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy early in the pro - cess , but starting at time zero , the center of the diffraction - limited spot of Bzz1p starts to move up to 250 nm from the cluster of Cdc15p , which is left behind in its original location near the cell surface . Therefore we expect that a 30 nm cuff of Cdc15p forms and remains close to the base of the tubule , whereas the 20 nm cuff of Bzz1p moves with the clathrin - coated tip of the invaginating tubule ( Figure 4 ) . Assuming that these F - BAR domains decorate the membrane in a closely packed helical array , our molecule counts show that the F - BAR proteins concentrate a high density of SH3 domains on these membrane invaginations : w 45 , 000 SH3 domains / m m 2 at the tip ( two SH3 domains / Bzz1p molecule ) and w 16 , 500 SH3 domains / m m 2 near the neck of the tubular invag - ination ( one SH3 domain from Cdc15p ) . The high density of Bzz1p SH3 domains is expected to activate Wsp1p , because dimers of WASp - VCA are much more effective in stimulating Arp2 / 3 complex than monomers [ 48 , 49 ] . One surprise is that recruitment of the F - BAR proteins follows in time and depends on the nucleation - promoting factors , because the F - BAR domains presumably associate withthemembranetubule , andit is easiertoenvisage a layered structure forming outward from the membrane surface with the F - BAR proteins acting as adapters between the membrane and their partners , the nucleation - promoting factors . Further work is required to clarify this conundrum . In addition to recruiting F - BAR proteins to sites of endocy - tosis , NPFs may activate the F - BAR proteins to tubulate membranes . Structural studies showed that the SH3 domain of the full - length F - BAR protein syndapin inhibits the potent membrane deforming activity and that ligand binding to the SH3 domain unclamps the protein leading to membrane defor - mation [ 50 , 51 ] . Thus SH3 domains of F - BAR proteins may serve both inhibitory and targeting roles [ 52 ] . Role of F - BAR Proteins in S . pombe Endocytic Vesicle Scission The endocytic vesicle separates from the plasma membrane during the third step . In animal cells , scission of the vesicle depends on dynamin and occurs just before dissociation of the clathrin coat [ 53 ] . Actin patch movements , vesicle scis - sion , and endocytosis in fungi are compromised in the absence of Wsp1p , Myo1p , Cdc15p , or Bzz1p , so this step depends on the contributions of each of these proteins to actin polymerization [ 39 ] . The time of scission has not been documented in fungi , but we suggest that it occurs at about time + 6 s when clathrin and coronin move beyond Wsp1p and Vrp1p , which stop moving about 300 – 400 nm from the cell surface . In cells lacking either Bzz1p or Cdc15p , patches marked with coronin either move only short distances from the cell surface or retract back to the cell surface , so we suggest that vesicles loaded with the cargo fail to pinch off at this step and remain associated with the plasma membrane as a consequence of this lack of movement . Clathrin disassoci - ates when it moves about 500 nm from the plasma mem - brane [ 5 , 40 ] , whereas coronin moves up to 800 nm into the cytoplasm . Our observations provide clues regarding the roles of F - BAR proteins in actin polymerization associated with endocytosis and suggest a possible mechanism of vesicle scission ( Fig - ure 4 ) . Because Bzz1p and Wsp1p separate from Cdc15p and Myo1p after time zero , actin polymerization driven by these nucleation - promoting factors should concentrate actin ﬁlament formation in two zones along the invaginated mem - brane tubule . A ring of Cdc15p and Myo1p might stimulate one zone of actin assembly near the cell surface . A ring of acti - vated Wsp1p would concentrate actin ﬁlament formation in a second zone near the tip of the invaginated membrane tubule . We suggest that the movement of Bzz1p and Wsp1p with most other patch proteins corresponds to the elongation of tubular invagination of the plasma membrane . We propose that the two rings of F - BAR proteins and their partner nucleation - promoting factors produce two opposing zones of actin polymerization that push against each other to elongate the tubular invagination of the plasma membrane , which breaks to release the coated vesicle ( Figure 4 ) . The high density of branched ﬁlaments arising in these two zones should preclude their interpenetration , allowing polymeriza - tion to produce force to stretch the membrane and contribute to scission of the vesicle without requiring precise orientation of the ﬁlaments relative to the membrane . This new idea complements previous proposals to ex - plain the vesicle scission . The ‘‘mechanochemical’’ model ( I ) mEGFP - Myo1p was expressed from the native locus and the numbers of molecules per patch were tracked over time in wild - type cells ( n = 21 patches ) , 41xnmt1cdc15 cells ( n = 15 ) , and D bzz1 cells ( n = 12 ) . ( J ) mEGFP - Wsp1p was expressed from the native locus and the numbers of molecules per patch were tracked over time in wild - type cells ( n = 12 patches ) , 41xnmt1cdc15 cells ( n = 23 ) , and D bzz1 cells ( n = 18 ) . ( K ) The Arp2 / 3 complex subunit ArpC5p - mEGFP was expressed from the native locus and the numbers of molecules per patch were tracked over time in wild - type cells ( n = 12 ) , 41xnmt1cdc15 cells ( n = 7 ) , and D bzz1 cells ( n = 8 ) . ( L ) GFP - actin was expressed from the leu + locus in the presence of wild - type levels of native actin from a 41xnmt1 promoter in wild - type cells ( B ) , D bzz1 cells lacking Bzz1p ( C ) , and from a 3xnmt1 promoter in 41xnmt1cdc15 cells ( , ) . The numbers of molecules per patch were tracked over time . F - BAR Proteins in Fission Yeast 1455 [ 54 ] focuses on the contributions of the membrane lipids and the actin cytoskeleton . BAR domain proteins are proposed to bind and protect PIP 2 from hydrolysis by phosphatidylinosi - tal phosphatases in the tubular invagination of the plasma membrane . Hydrolysis of PIP 2 elsewhere along the tubular invagination generates PIP . The mobility of PIP and immo - bility of PIP 2 bound to BAR domain proteins produce a lipid phase separation that changes the membrane tension along the boundary between the two phases [ 54 , 55 ] . The change in membrane tension coupled to the pulling and pushing forces of actin cytoskeleton and myosin I at the plasma membrane generate vesicle scission . An alternative model [ 56 ] based on in vitro reconstitution experiments proposes that BAR domain proteins mediate assembly of actin ﬁla - ments at an angle to the invaginating membrane providing a pushing force that squeezes the membrane tubule and facilitates ﬁssion of the vesicle . The localization of overex - pressed Las17 ( budding yeast WASp ) on the invaginating membrane [ 57 ] is consistent with this hypothesis . Much more information about the organization of the molecules in actin patches is required to evaluate all of these hypotheses . The overall pathway of endocytic patch assembly is similar in budding and ﬁssion yeast , but subtle differences include the total lifetime of the patches and the numbers of some patch proteins . Actin patches in S . cerevisiae depend on Bzz1p to activate the Wsp1p homolog Las17p [ 58 ] but appear to lack a second F - BAR protein . However , type I myosin Myo5p localizes with actin ﬁlaments to a different part of the plasma membrane invaginations than Bzz1p and Las17p [ 9 ] , so two zones of actin polymerization may also contribute to endocytosis in budding yeast .

Recruitment of Cdc15p requires Myo1p ( Figure 3G ) , and both the proteins remain near the cell surface . Bzz1p binds and activates Wsp1p to stimulate the assembly of branched actin ﬁlaments by Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 3C – 3F ) . We assume that movement of Bzz1p , Wsp1p , and many other patch proteins is associated with elongation of the plasma membrane tubule . We propose that expansion of branched ﬁlaments from two distinct zones of NPFs pushes the tip of the invaginating tubule away from the cell surface ( 2 – 6 s ) ( Figure 1E ) contributing to scission of the coated vesicle .
