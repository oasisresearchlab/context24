Journal of Statistical Physics , Vol . 52 , Nos . 1 / 2 , 1988 Possible Generalization of Boltzmann - Gibbs Statistics Constantino Tsallis 1 Received November 12 , 1987 , revision received March 8 , 1988 With the use of a quantity normally scaled in multifractals , a generalized form is postulated for entropy , namely Sq = = - k1 - Zwt pq / ( q - 1 ) , where qe ~ characterizes the generalization and { Pi } are the probabilities associated with W ( microscopic ) configurations ( WE N ) . The main properties associated with this entropy are established , particularly those corresponding to the microcanonical and canonical ensembles . The Boltzmann - Gibbs statistics is recovered as the q - - - , 1 limit . KEY WORDS : Generalized statistics ; entropy ; multifractals ; statistical ensembles . Multifractal concepts and structures are quickly acquiring importance in many active areas of research ( e . g . , nonlinear dynamical systems , growth models , commensurate / incommensurate structures ) . This is due to their utility as well as to their elegance . Within this framework , the quantity that is normally scaled is pq , where Pi is the probability associated with an event and q is any real number . ( 1 ) I shall use this quantity to generalize the standard expression of the entropy S in information theory , namely k w S = - Zi = lpilnpi , where WEN is the total number of possible ( microscopic ) configurations and { pi } is the associated probabilities .

Figure 1 illustrates definition ( 1 ) . One can rewrite Sq as follows : k w Su _ ~ . pi ( l _ pq 1 ) ( 2 ) q - l i = l which makes evident that Sq ~ 0 in all cases . It vanishes for W = 1 , Vq , as well as for W > 1 , q > 0 , and only one event with probability one ( all the others having vanishing probabilities ) . Microcanonical Ensemble . We want to extremize S u with the condition ZW ~ p ~ = 1 . By introducing a Lagrange parameter , it is straightforward to obtain that Sq is extremized , for all values of q , in the case of equiprobability , i . e . , Pi = 1 / W , Vi , and consequently H / q - q - 1 ( 3 ) Sq = k 1 - q Sq k Fig . 1 . 15 I 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 ' ~ o 0 . 5 p " Plot of Sq ( { Pi } ) for W = 2 and typical values of q ( numbers on curves ) . Notice the monotonic influence of q , a fact that reappears in a variety of properties . Generalization of Boltzmann - Gibbs Statistics 481 It is immediately verified that S 1 ~ - k In W ( Y ) thus recovering the celebrated Boltzmann expression . Figure 2 illustrates Eq . ( 3 ) . The Sq given by Eq . ( 3 ) diverges if q ~ < l and saturates at Sq = k / ( q - 1 ) if q > 1 , in the W - - * oo limit . It is straightforward to prove that the extremum indicated in Eq . ( 3 ) is a maximum ( minimum ) for q > 0 ( q < 0 ) ; for q = 0 , Sq ( { pi } ) = k ( W - 1 ) for all { Pi } . Finally , Eq . ( 3 ) implies Sq _ e ( 1 q ) Sl / k - - 1 ( 4 ) k 1 - q Concavity . Let us extend here a property already mentioned , namely that q > 0 ( q < 0 ) implies that the extremum of S u is a maximum ( minimum ) . Let { Pi } and { p ~ } be two sets of probabilities corresponding to a unique set of W possibilities , and 2 such that 0 < 2 < 1 . Define an inter - mediate probability law as follows : pT = = _ 2pi + ( 1 - 2 ) p ; ( Vi ) ( 5 ) Sq m k 2 _ 0 . 5 0 i 2 3 4 W Fig . 2 .

The equalities hold for q r 0 for p ~ = p ; , Vi . AdditiviW . Let us assume two independent systems A and B with ensembles of configurational possibilities g2 A = { 1 , 2 . . . . . i , . . . , WA } and g2 e - { 1 , 2 , . . . , j , . . . , We } , respectively , the corresponding probabilities being { pA } and { p ~ } . Now consider A w B , the ensemble of possibilities being g2 A ~ e = { ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , . . . , ( i , j ) , . . . , ( WA , We ) } ; let p ~ e denote the corresponding probabilities . The independence of the systems means that p ~ ~ s = p ~ p ~ , V ( i , j ) , hence E A ~ B q ( p ~ ) = ( pJ ) ~ ( pT ) ~ i , j i 1 Hence - using Eq . ( 1 ) ~ qA ~ e _ _ SA + SqS ( additivity ) ( 7 ) with Sq = k ln1 + ( 1 - q ) Sq / k ( 8 ) 1 - q In the q ~ 1 limit , Eq . ( 7 ) becomes S ~ ~ e = S A + Sf , thus recovering the standard additivity of the entropies of independent systems . For arbitrary q , Sq reproduces the Renyi entropy . ( 2 ) To study the case of correlated systems i . e . , n A ~ B is not equal to , - 0 ( SZwA 1 pA ~ e ) ( Zw , 1 p ~ e ) for all ( i , j ) , it is useful to define - - A ~ B A w B - - A - - Sq P u rq ( { pJ ~ e } ) sq ( { p ~ } ) - s ~ pj ~ e - e A ~ e \ kj = l i 1 It is clear from Eq . ( 7 ) that independence ( no correlation ) implies Fq = 0 , Vq . For arbitrary and fixed { p ~ ~ B } implying correlation , it is easy to prove that F 1 < 0 ( subadditivity of the standard entropies of correlated systems ) and F0 = 0 . For arbitrary values of q , Fq presents a great sensitivity to { pj ~ B } , it might be positive or negative for q > > 1 as well as for q ~ - 1 , and typically exhibits more than one extremum . Extensive and systematic computer verification indicates that , generally speaking , Fq varies smoothly with q , but presents no particular regularities besides F 0 = 0 and F ~ ~ < 0 . Generalization of Boltzmann - Gibbs Statistics 483 When { pA ~ , } gradually approach vanishing correlation , Fq gradually flattens until eventually achieving Fq = O , Vq . Canonical Ensemble . ditions Z ~ I Pi = 1 and We want to extremize Sq with the con - w 2 Pi ~ i : Uq ( 9 ) i = l where { e ~ } and Uq are known real numbers ( the same value ei might be associated with more than one possible configuration ) ; they will be referred to as generalized spectrum and generalized internal energy . I introduce the and fl Lagrange parameters and define the quantity Sq w w Oq - - - ~ + ~ ~ pi - c ~ fl ( q - 1 ) ~ Pi ~ i ( 10 ) k = l i = 1 which is written this way for future convenience . Imposing O ~ q / ~ Pi = O , Vi , one obtains picc 1 - fl ( q - 1 ) ei I / ( q 1 ) ; hence , 1 - fl ( q - 1 ) s ~ 1 / ( q - 1 ) Pi - ( 11 ) Zq with W Zq ~ - Z E1 - - fl ( q - 1 ) ~ 1 1 / ( q 1 ) ( 12 ) l = 1 It is immediately verified that , in the q ~ 1 limit , one recovers pi = e fl ~ i / Z 1 ( 11 ' ) with l , v Z1 - ~ e - ~ ( 12 ' ) l = 1 It is straightforward to see that an alternative manner for obtaining the power - law distribution expressed in Eq . ( 11 ) is to extremize Sq ( or equivalently Sq ) with the condition Y ~ w 1 pqei = Uq instead of Eq . ( 9 ) . If A and B are two independent systems with probabilities ( spectrum ) { pA } ( { e { } ) and { pT } ( { e ~ } ) , respectively , the probabilities corresponding to A w B satisfy p ~ U s = pAp ~ , V ( i , j ) . This implies Aug = 1 - fl ( q - 1 ) eA1 - - fl ( q - - 1 ) ST ( 13 ) 1 - - fl ( q - - 1 ) eij 484 Tsallis or equivalently with eo - A , ~ B = gA + gff ( 14 ) ln1 + 3 ( 1 - q ) e g - ( 15 ) 3 ( 1 - q ) In the q - - + 1 limit ( and / or 3 ~ 0 limit ) , Eq . ( 14 ) becomes % . A ~ B - - e ( + e ~ , - thus recovering the standard energy additivity . The property ( 14 ) , together with the factorization of probabilities , placed in Eq . ( 9 ) yields UuA ~ = C A + U ~ ( 16 ) with ln1 + 3 ( 1 - q ) Uq ( 17 ) Uq - 3 ( 1 - q ) In the q ~ 1 limit ( and / or 3 ~ 0 limit ) , Eq . ( 16 ) becomes U { ~ 8 = U { + Uf , thus recovering the standard additivity of the internal energies of indepen - dent systems . I now discuss the main characteristics of the distribution law ( 11 ) . First , notice that this distribution is invariant under the transformation 1 - 3 ( q - 1 ) et - ~ 1 - 3 ( q - 1 ) et - - I - 3 ( q - 1 ) eo for all l , e0 being an arbitrary fixed real number . In other words , the distribution ( 11 ) is invariant under gr this is in fact a trivial consequence of the fact that the distribution can be formally rewritten as Pi ~ : exp ( - 3gi ) . For fl ( q - 1 ) - ~ 0 , we recover the well - known invariance of the Boltzmann - Gibbs statistics under uniform translation of the energy spectrum . Figure 3 illustrates distribution ( 11 ) . Notice that , for q > 1 , pi = 0 for all levels such that s ~ > ~ l / fl ( q - 1 ) ( ~ < ~ - l / fl ( q - I ) ) if fl > O ( fl < O ) , i . e . , positive ( negative ) " temperatures . " On the other hand , for q < l , the levels such that e ; ~ < - lfl ( 1 - q ) ( ~ > ~ 1 / - 31 ( l - q ) ) are , if fl > 0 ( fl < 0 ) , highly occupied , in a way that is clearly reminiscent of the Bose - Einstein condensation . To better realize the unusual properties of the present statistics , it is instructive to analyze the following situation . Assume q > l , fl > O , and { ei } such that 0 < el < e2 < " ' " < e w ( W might even diverge ) . When 1 / 3 is above ( q - 1 ) ew , all levels have a finite occupancy probability ; when ( q - 1 ) ew l < l / 3 < ( q - 1 ) ew , then pl > p2 > " " > pw _ ~ > pw = O .

The curves are parametrized by q : q = 1 , standard exponential law ; q > 1 , the distribution pressents a cutoff at ~ ei = 1 / ( q - 1 ) ( with a slope of 0 , - 1 , and - ~ for q < 2 , q = 2 , and q > 2 , respectively ) and diverges for / ~ et ~ - ~ ; q < 1 , the distribution diverges at / 3e ~ = - 1 / ( 1 - q ) ( the dashed line indicates the asymptote for q ~ 0 ) and vanishes for / 3e ~ + co . probabilities successively vanish while 1 / / 3 decreases . One eventually arrives at ( q - 1 ) g ~ < 1 / / ~ < ( q - 1 ) g2 , which implies p ~ - - 1 . Finally , the tem - peratures 1 / / 3 in the interval 0 , ( q - 1 ) el are physically unaccessible , thus generalizing the nonaccessibility of 1 / / 3 - - 0 in standard thermodynamics . A simple example will illustrate this and similar facts . Application . Consider two nondegenerate levels with values el - = - 6 and ~ 2 = e + 6 ( 3 > 0 ; g - ~ 0 ) . The quantity Uq ( / 3 ) is given by Uq = g ~ Pl + e2P2 . A straightforward calculation yields 1 - ( q - 1 ) ( g / 6 - 1 ) / x l / ( q - ~ ) - 1 - ( q - 1 ) ( e / 6 + 1 ) / x 1 / ( q ~ ) Yq = - 1 - ( q - 1 ) ( g / 6 - 1 ) / x 1 / ( q - 1 ) + 1 - ( q - 1 ) ( g / 6 + 1 ) / x 1 / ( q - 1 ) ( 18 ) with x = I / f16 and yq = ( Uq - - 8 ) / c ~ E - 1 , 1 . Equation ( t8 ) is invariant under ( x , yq , q - - 1 , g / c ~ ) ~ ( X , yq , - - ( q - - l ) , - - e / b ) and also under ( x , yq , q , g / c ~ ) - . , , . ( - x , - yq , q , - e / 0 ) . Consequently , it suffices to discuss q > ~ 1 and g / 6 > ~ O . In the limit q - - , 1 , one obtains Yl = - th ( 1 / x ) , Vg / 6 . For q ~ 1 , yq ( X ) depends on e / 6 : see Figs . 4 and 5 . 486 Tsallis ( o } ( c ) 0 ( ~ : o ) - , ~ ( b ) _ _ o . . . .

The dashed region in ( d ) indicates the unaccessible " temperatures . " I conclude by recalling that , using the quantity normally scaled for multifractals , I have postulated an expression for the entropy that generalizes the usual one ( recovered for the parameter q ~ 1 ) . By preserv - ing the standard variational principle , I have established the microcanonical and canonical distributions , as well as several other proper - ties . Some of the emerging peculiar characteristics are illustrated through a simple example . One of the most interesting is the fact that the unaccessible " temperatures " might belong to a finite interval that shrinks on the T = 0 point in the q - - + 1 limit . Finally , the fact that Sq / k , 3ei , and BUq are additive under one and the same functional form { namely f ( x ) = _ In I - 1 + ( 1 - q ) x / ( q - 1 ) } opens the door to the generalization of standard thermodynamics through the introduction of appropriate generalized ther - modynamic potentials .
