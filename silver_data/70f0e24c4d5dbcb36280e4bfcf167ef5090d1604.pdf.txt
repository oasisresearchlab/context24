We have shown that CD2AP loss - of - function increases β - amyloid ( A β ) endocytic 36 production , but whether it contributes to synapse dysfunction is unknown . Because CD2AP is an 37 actin - binding protein , it may also function in F - actin - rich dendritic spines , the excitatory 38 postsynaptic compartment . Here , we demonstrate that CD2AP colocalises with F - actin in 39 dendritic spines . Cell - autonomous depletion of CD2AP specifically reduces spine density and 40 volume , with a functional decrease in synapse formation and neuronal network activity . Post - 41 synaptic reexpression of CD2AP but not blocking Aβ - production is sufficient to rescue spine 42 density . CD2AP overexpression increases spine density , volume , and synapse formation , while a 43 rare LOAD CD2AP mutation induces aberrant F - actin spine - like protrusions without synapses . 44 CD2AP controls postsynaptic actin turnover , with the LOAD mutation in CD2AP decreasing F - 45 actin dynamicity . Our data support that CD2AP risk variants could contribute to LOAD synapse 46 dysfunction by disrupting spine formation and growth by deregulating actin dynamics . 47 Graphical Abstract 48 49 Introduction 50 Late - onset Alzheimer ' s disease ( LOAD ) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease 51 that affects 1 in 9 people aged 65 , increasing with aging ( Alzheimer ' s Association , 2023 ) . 52 Unfortunately , no effective treatment is available . A better understanding of the causal 53 mechanisms may offer novel therapeutic strategies . The loss of neurones accompanying 54 the pathology that defines AD , β - amyloid ( Aβ ) plaques , and tau neurofibrillary tangles is 55 likely irreversible and untreatable . In contrast , early synapse dysfunction , which 56 precedes neurodegeneration , may be modifiable . We believe it is necessary to dissect 57 the causal mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction of LOAD to identify novel promising 58 therapeutic targets . 59 CD2AP gene encoding for CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) was identified as a 60 putative risk factor by genome - wide screens of thousands of LOAD patients 61 ( Hollingworth et al . , 2011 ; Naj et al . , 2011 ) , confirmed in meta - analysis studies ( Chen et 62 al . , 2015 ; Gao et al . , 2022 ; Kamboh et al . , 2012 ; Kunkle et al . , 2019 ) . While GWAS 63 identified frequent noncoding variants , whole gene sequencing identified a pathological 64 variant that introduces a mutation in CD2AP ( Lys633Arg or K633R ) highly associated with 65 AD ( Vardarajan et al . , 2015 ) , but with unclear biological significance . The level of CD2AP 66 brain expression in patients carrying CD2AP variants is unknown but was reduced in the 67 blood of LOAD patients ( Tao et al . , 2017 ) and accumulated in advanced AD ( Camacho et 68 al . , 2022 ) . The CD2AP susceptibility loci correlate with the burden of neuritic plaques in 69 AD patients ( Shulman et al . , 2013 ) . 70 CD2AP is an 80 kDa ubiquitously expressed scaffolding protein that belongs to the 71 CIN85 / CD2AP protein family , with three SH3 N - terminal domains , a proline - rich domain , 72 and a coiled - coil c - terminal domain with actin - binding sites ( Bruck et al . , 2006 ; Cormont 73 et al . , 2003 ; Rouka et al . , 2015 ) . Initially identified in T cells , CD2AP is important in kidney 74 glomeruli cells , and its loss of function is related to proteinuria and renal dysfunction 75 ( Kim et al . , 2003 ; Shih et al . , 1999 ) . CD2AP anchors slit diaphragm proteins to the actin 76 cytoskeleton in glomeruli ( Li et al . , 2000 ; Shih et al . , 2001 ) ; controls the polymerisation 77 and stability of F - actin in undifferentiated cells ( Tang & Brieher , 2013 ; Welsch et al . , 78 2001 ) ; interacts with F - actin , cortactin , or capping protein ( CP ) ( Lynch et al . , 2003 ; Zhao 79 et al . , 2013 ) ; and associates with membranes for endocytosis and endosomal 80 maturation ( Furusawa et al . , 2019 ; Gauthier et al . , 2007 ; Monzo et al . , 2005 ; Tolvanen 81 et al . , 2015 ; Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ) . 82 CD2AP is expressed in neurones ( Li et al . , 2000 ; Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ) , more in 83 dendrites than in axons in mature neurones ( Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ) , consistent with 84 postsynaptic function . CD2AP may also contribute to axonal neurite extension ( Harrison 85 et al . , 2016 ) . 86 CD2AP was first associated with an AD mechanism by modulating tau toxicity in a 87 Drosophila model of AD ( Shulman et al . , 2014 ) and then to A β production but not to A β 88 deposition in an amyloidosis model ( PS1APP mice ) ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) . We established 89 that CD2AP loss of function , induced by shRNA - mediated depletion , disrupts the 90 endocytic trafficking of A β precursor protein ( APP ) , increasing its processing and A β 91 generation at maturing early endosomes leading to intraneuronal A β accumulation in 92 dendrites ( Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ) . However , it is unclear whether this increase in 93 intraneuronal A β can cause synapse dysfunction in LOAD , as we showed in early - onset 94 familial AD ( eFAD ) ( Almeida et al . , 2005 ; Snyder et al . , 2005 ; Takahashi et al . , 2004 ) . 95 CD2AP , like other LOAD risk genes , may cause synaptic dysfunction upstream A β 96 production ( Perdigão et al . , 2020 ) . Since CD2AP is an actin regulator and the actin 97 cytoskeleton is essential for spines that hold excitatory synapses ( Hotulainen & 98 Hoogenraad , 2010 ) , we hypothesised that CD2AP might function at spines and thus 99 impact synapses . Interestingly , the loss of Cindr , the Drosophila homolog of CD2AP , 100 impaired neuromuscular synapses by interfering with synapse maturation ( Ojelade et 101 al . , 2019 ) supports our hypothesis . 102 Here , we investigate CD2AP synaptic function using knockdown and overexpression 103 approaches in primary cultures of mouse cortical neurones and determine that CD2AP 104 plays a direct role in spine density and morphology , modulating synaptic contacts . 105 Notably , we found that a LOAD - associated mutation in CD2AP confers an aberrant gain 106 of function in spines . Mechanistically , we established that CD2AP functions in the spines 107 through spinal F - actin , wit h a minor contribution from Aβ production . Therefore , CD2AP 108 risk variants can contribute to LOAD synapse dysfunction by deregulating spinal F - actin 109 independently of Aβ . 110 Results 111 112 A pool of CD2AP localises in the spines . 113 Previously , we localised CD2AP in dendritic endosomes relevant to APP endocytic 114 trafficking in cortical mouse neurones ( Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ) . To determine if CD2AP 115 localised to synapses , we started by analyzing CD2AP distribution in synaptic fractions 116 of the mouse adult brain ( Fig . 1A ) . We found CD2AP present in the postsynaptic fraction 117 ( P3 ) positive for postsynaptic density protein - 95 ( PSD - 95 ) and negative for synapsin but 118 not in the presynaptic fraction ( S3 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Next , we investigated whether CD2AP was 119 present in the spines . We detected CD2AP puncta in most spines . Interestingly , we 120 frequently observed a punctum of CD2AP in the tip of the dendritic spines . We analysed 121 the distribution of CD2AP in dendrites of mature cortical mouse neurones expressing 122 mCherry to allow the morphological identification of dendritic spines . ( Fig . 1B ) . We 123 quantified the fraction of dendritic CD2AP or mCherry present in the spines and found 124 that 34 % of dendritic CD2AP , more than soluble mCherry ( 27 % ) , localises to the spines 125 of mature neurones ( 15 days in vitro ( DIV ) in BrainPhys media , or 21 DIV in Neurobasal 126 media ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Furthermore , we measured CD2AP levels during the differentiation and 127 synaptic maturation of primary mouse neurones cultured in BrainPhys media for 5 , 11 128 and 15 DIV ( Fig . 1D ) . CD2AP increased 3 - fold from 5 to 15 DIV , similarly to PSD - 95 , the 129 postsynaptic marker ( Fig . 1E ) , supporting that CD2AP is expressed primarily in 130 synaptically mature neurones and suggests a synaptic function for CD2AP . We also 131 analysed the colocalisation of CD2AP with PSD - 95 in neurones expressing GFP to identify 132 dendritic spines ( Fig . 1F ) morphologically . Quantification revealed that 31 % of CD2AP 133 puncta colocalised with PSD - 95 , which was equal to the % of PSD - 95 puncta that 134 colocalised with CD2AP ( Fig . 1G ) , indicating that CD2AP is present in one - third of spines . 135 In the 3D reconstruction ( IMARIS ) of a GFP - filled spine , the location of a CD2AP punctum 136 at the tip of a spine , positioned laterally to the PSD - 95 punctum , is highlighted ( Fig . 1H ) . 137 Endocytic zones are also lateral to the PSD ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . Since we showed that CD2AP 138 also localises to early endosomes , we include an example of a spine where a CD2AP 139 punctum is laterally associated with the early endosome marker EEA1 to the F - actin - rich 140 spine head ( Fig . 1I ) . Furthermore , we imaged the movement of CD2AP - GFP puncta in a 141 spine in mature live neurones ( 15 DIV ) ( Fig . 1G , supplementary movie 1 ) . 142 Together , these data demonstrate that a pool of CD2AP is localised to the spines in 143 mature primary cortical neurones . 144 145 The removal of CD2AP reduces spine density and synapses . 146 The localisation of CD2AP in spines led us to investigate whether CD2AP has synaptic 147 function using a knockdown approach . To knock down CD2AP , we infected neurones 148 with lentivirus expressing GFP and different sequences of small hairpin interfering RNA 149 against CD2AP ( shCD2AP - 1 and shCD2AP - 2 ) ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) or a nontargeting shRNA 150 sequence ( shControl ) . We confirmed the CD2AP knockdown by western blot using a 151 mouse neuroblastoma cell line , Neuro2a cells and mouse fibroblasts ( Fig . S1A , B ) . 152 To determine the impact of CD2AP knockdown on spines , we analysed spines , 153 morphologically identified using the expression of GFP in shCD2AP - and shControl - 154 treated neurones by epifluorescence microscopy and 3D reconstruction using IMARIS . 155 We observed fewer and thinner spines after CD2AP knockdown ( Fig . 2A ) . Quantifying 156 spine density , the number of spines per dendritic length ( 10  m ) , revealed that it was 157 reduced by 55 % and 60 % with shCD2AP - 1 and shCD2AP - 2 treatment , respectively ( Fig . 158 2B ) . Furthermore , the volume of the remaining spines decreased by almost 30 % after 159 treatment with shCD2AP - 1 and shCD2AP - 2 ( Fig . 2C ) . 160 To assess whether CD2AP - dependent reduction in spines affected synapses , we 161 performed immunostaining for vGluT1 and PSD - 95 to identify pre - and postsynaptic 162 compartments , respectively , of excitatory synapses . In dendrites depleted for CD2AP , 163 there was a reduction in PSD - 95 and vGluT1 puncta ( Fig . 2D ) . We automatically 164 quantified their colocalisation as a proxy for synapses . The synapse density along 165 dendrites was reduced by 24 % and 41 % with treatment with shCD2AP - 1 and shCD2AP - 166 2 , respectively ( Fig . 2E ) . This synapse density reduction seems to be mainly accounted 167 by the reduction in PSD - 95 puncta density with shCD2AP - 1 and shCD2AP - 2 treatment 168 ( 25 % ) ( Fig . 2F ) since the vGluT1 puncta density remained unchanged ( Fig . 2G ) . We 169 measured the density of active synapses after shCD2AP treatment by monitoring the 170 density of FM4 . 64 labelled presynaptic puncta after induction of high potassium - 171 induced neuronal depolarisation ( 90 s ) ( Fig . 2H ) . The FM4 . 64 puncta density was 172 significantly reduced by 25 % and 15 % with shCD2AP - 1 and 2 , respectively ( Fig . 2I ) . 173 These results support synapse reduction due to the lack of functional spines in the 174 absence of CD2AP . 175 Since we and others showed that CD2AP knockdown increases intraneuronal Aβ42 176 ( Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ; Liao et al . , 2015 ) and that Aβ in early - onset transgenic mouse 177 primary cortical neurones reduces spines ( Almeida et al . , 2005 ) , we investigated 178 whether reduction in spine density would be rescued by blocking Aβ produc tion as 179 previously ( Burrinha et al . , 2021 ) . We measured the density of PSD - 95 puncta in 180 shCD2AP neurones treated with the BACE inhibitor ( BACEi ) and the gamma - secretase 181 inhibitor ( DAPT ) ( Fig . 2J - M ) . Treatment with BACEi and DAPT increased PSD - 95 puncta 182 density in neurones treated with shCD2AP - 2 , but remained significantly reduced 183 compared to shControl ( Fig . 2J - M ) . Notably , DAPT , but not BACEi , treatment reduced 184 PSD - 95 density in shControl neurones , supporting that γ - secretase has synaptic relevant 185 substrates ( Bittner et al . , 2009 ; Barthet et al . , 2018 ; Servián - Morilla et al . , 2018 ) . These 186 results support the notion that Aβ production contributes but does not fully account for 187 spine loss induced by CD2AP knockdown . 188 Thus , we discovered that CD2AP depletion reduces synapses by affecting the spines 189 in part independently of Aβ production . 190 191 CD2AP knockdown impacts neuronal network activity 192 To investigate the impact of CD2AP knockdown on basal neuronal activity , we 193 performed multielectrode array ( MEA ) recordings on primary neurones cultured in 194 BrainPhys for 15 DIV . A representative whole MEA ( 4096 electrodes ) shows bright 195 red / yellow / white active electrodes in the shControl - treated neurones , consistent with 196 spontaneous neuronal activity ( Fig . 3A ) . The neurones showed less bright 197 red / yellow / white electrodes . We quantified the percentage of active electrodes 198 displaying neuronal activity that registered more than three spikes per s and found , on 199 average , less active electrodes in shCD2AP - 2 neurones ( 2 . 9 % ) and a tendency to 200 decrease in shCD2AP - 1 neurones compared to shControl neurones ( 6 % ) ( Fig . 3B ) , 201 supporting that CD2AP depletion suppresses neuronal activity . 202 The raster profiles show the lower spiking and burst activity of shCD2AP - 1 and 203 shCD2AP - 2 neurones compared to shControl neurones ( Fig . 3C ) . The spike frequency on 204 each active electrode , as in the representative traces ( Fig . 3D ) , was reduced in shCD2AP - 205 1 neurones ( 6 . 0 Hz ) and shCD2AP - 2 neurones ( 5 . 9 Hz ) compared to shControl neurones 206 ( 6 . 7 Hz ) ( Fig . 3E ) . The cumulative frequency of spiking neurones showed a lower 207 frequency of high spiking neurones after shCD2AP - 1 and - 2 treatment than in control 208 neurones , suggesting that depleting CD2AP mitigates neural excitability ( Fig . 3F ) . 209 In the raster profiles , we also observed synchronised bursts of activity in the 210 neuronal network . By calculating the burst rate ( burst / min ) in each active electrode , we 211 found a lower burst frequency in shCD2AP - 1 ( 8 burst / min ) and shCD2AP - 2 neurones ( 7 212 burst / min ) compared to shControl neurones ( 13 burst / min ) . Although no significant 213 changes were observed in network burst rate ( Fig . 3H ) , network burst duration ( Fig . 3I ) , 214 average of spikes per network burst ( Fig . 3J ) and interburst interval ( Fig . 3J ) with the 215 knockdown of CD2AP , the interburst spike frequency reduced from 717 . 8 Hz in 216 shControl neurones to 269 . 7 Hz and 462 . 8 Hz , in shCD2AP - 1 and shCD2AP - 2 treated 217 neurones , respectively ( Fig . 3L ) . These results indicate that the basic structure of the 218 burst events and the time between them remained stable despite the overall reduction 219 in frequency , consistent with a decrease in the synchronised activity of the neuronal 220 network in the absence of CD2AP . 221 The findings suggest that the impact on neural activity is complex and may involve 222 changes in network synchrony and excitability . Further investigation is warranted to 223 understand the underlying mechanisms . 224 225 CD2AP mutant increases spine density more than CD2AP wild - type overexpression 226 After establishing that CD2AP knockdown reduced spines and synaptic activity , we 227 investigated the impact on synapses of the overexpression of CD2AP and of the K633R 228 coding mutation in CD2AP identified in LOAD patients and associated with a higher risk 229 of LOAD ( Vardarajan et al . , 2015 ) . We transfected primary neurones with CD2AP WT - GFP 230 CD2AP K663R - GFP and the control GFP plasmid at 7 DIV and evaluated spinal and synaptic 231 alterations at 15 DIV ( Fig . S2 A ) . We mutagenised CD2AP WT - GFP to obtain CD2AP K633R - 232 GFP ( Fig S2 B ) . 233 CD2AP WT and CD2AP K633R expression were evident in dendrites and dendritic 234 protrusions like spines ( Fig . 4A ) . We noted that overexpression of CD2AP WT led to an 235 increase in the number of primary dendrites , their length , and the number of 236 intersections , unaltered by the LOAD mutation ( Fig . S2 D - H ) . 237 Interestingly , 50 % of CD2AP WT and 58 % of CD2AP K633R are in dendritic protrusion - 238 like spines ( Fig . 4A - B ) , representing an increase of 47 % and 71 % relative to endogenous 239 CD2AP ( 34 % ; Fig . 1C ) , respectively . These data indicate that the LOAD mutation in CD2AP 240 increases its expression in spines . We assessed whether CD2AP - positive protrusions 241 were spines by labelling with PSD - 95 ( Fig . 4C ) . Colocalisation analysis revealed the 242 percentage of PSD - 95 puncta positive for CD2AP K633R ( 47 % ) inferior to CD2AP WT ( 64 % ) , 243 indicating that there are more spines positive for CD2AP WT than for CD2AP K633R ( Fig . 4D ) . 244 Dendritic spines are highly motile in vitro and in vivo ( Lendvai et al . , 2000 ; Tashiro & 245 Yuste , 2004 ) . This motility is likely related to extensions and retractions as if searching 246 for presynaptic partners . Spine motility also allows for maturation - related 247 morphological changes ( Bonhoeffer & Yuste , 2002 ) . Live neurones were imaged every 248 30 s for 10 minutes to examine rapid spine motility ( Fig . 3E ) ( Tashiro & Yuste , 2004 ) . We 249 observed spines showing motility with expansions and contractions during imaging . We 250 measured the spine area during the imaging and calculated the spine motility index to 251 quantify the degree of spine motility ( Dunaevsky et al . , 1999 ) . The motility index was 252 quantified by calculating the difference between the largest and smallest spine area , 253 normalised to the average spine area during the movie . While CD2AP WT tended to 254 decrease spine motility , only the CD2AP K633R - positive spines significantly reduced 255 motility by more than 50 % ( Fig . 4F ) . 256 CD2AP WT and CD2AP K633R - positive spines were denser and bulkier than the control 257 ( GFP ) ( Fig . 4G ) . We transfected primary neurones with CD2AP WT or CD2AP K633R and the 258 volume marker mCherry for spine density and spine head volume analysis . Spines were 259 manually identified and counted based on mCherry expression . Spine density increased 260 ( 25 % ) in neurones expressing CD2AP WT ( 8 . 3 spines / 10 µm ) and increased by 53 % in 261 neurones expressing CD2AP K633 ( 10 . 1 spines / 10 µm ) relative to control neurones ( GFP ) 262 ( 6 . 6 spines / 10 µm ) ( Fig . 4H ) . 263 Spine head volume was measured upon 3D reconstruction with IMARIS software 264 based on mCherry expression . Overexpression of CD2AP WT increased the spine head 265 volume by 26 % ( 0 . 058 µm 3 ) and the CD2AP K633R overexpression increased 2 . 5 times the 266 volume of the head of the spine ( 0 . 115 µm 3 ) compared to control spines ( 0 . 046 µm 3 ) 267 ( Fig . 4I ) . These results together with the negative impact of CD2AP knockdown on spines 268 ( Fig . 2A - C ) indicate that CD2AP is a positive regulator of spine formation and growth and 269 that the LOAD K633R mutation could enhance CD2AP spinal function . 270 To assess the impact of CD2AP WT and CD2AP K633R expression on excitatory synapses , 271 we analysed vGluT1 and PSD - 95 colocalisation ( Fig . 4J ) . Synapse density increased with 272 CD2AP WT expression ( Fig . 4K ) . As did PSD - 95 and vGluT1 density increased upon 273 CD2AP WT expression ( Fig . 4L - M ) . These results indicate that the postsynaptic expression 274 of CD2AP WT likely increased PSD - 95 , consistent with the induction of the formation and 275 growth of mature spines . This postsynaptic expansion may translate into a presynaptic 276 adaptation in the non - expressing presynaptic neurone since vGluT1 accompanied the 277 increase in PSD - 95 . Unexpectedly , given the increase in spine density and volume 278 induced by CD2AP K633R expression , synapse density only increased with CD2AP WT 279 expression ( Fig . 4K - M ) . In particular , PSD - 95 area increased in neurones ( Fig . 4N ) . The 280 LOAD CD2AP K633R did not enhance synapse density ; instead , it interfered with the 281 function of CD2AP . 282 These results and the negative impact of CD2AP knockdown on spines and synapses 283 support that CD2AP has a postsynaptic function that impacts synapses . 284 285 CD2AP controls spinal F - actin . 286 We established that CD2AP functions in spine formation and growth and that a LOAD 287 risk variant may interfere with its function . Since CD2AP is an F - actin binding protein and 288 a regulator of actin dynamics , we investigated whether CD2AP regulates spines through 289 F - actin . 290 We colocalised CD2AP with F - actin , labelled with phalloidin , and cortactin , a spinal 291 F - actin regulator ( Schnoor et al . , 2018 ) . We observed F - actin foci present in most spines , 292 while CD2AP , like cortactin , was detected in a subset of spines ( Fig . 5A ) . In higher 293 magnification , a partial overlap between CD2AP and cortactin puncta with F - actin foci 294 in spine heads was detected ( Fig . 5A ) . We found a 30 % colocalisation of CD2AP with F - 295 actin and cortactin ( Fig . 5B ) . 296 Next , we evaluated the impact of CD2AP knockdown on spinal F - actin . We observed 297 less F - actin in the spines of shCD2AP - treated neurones ( Fig . 5C ) . Quantification revealed 298 that 34 % of dendritic F - actin is in the spines of neurones treated with shControl . In 299 neurones treated with shCD2AP - 1 and shCD2AP - 2 , the distribution of F - actin between 300 the shaft and spines reduced to 19 % and 21 % of dendritic F - actin , respectively ( Fig . 5D ) . 301 In CD2AP WT expressing dendrites , the % of spinal F - actin was like in control dendrites 302 ( GFP ) ( Fig . 5E - F ) . In contrast , we found that F - actin mean intensity increased in CD2AP WT 303 expressing dendrites relative to control ( Fig . 5E , G ) . Differently in spines expressing 304 CD2AP K633R , F - actin increased ( Fig . 5E - F ) , with puncta with a larger area ( Fig . 4H ) . These 305 results indicate that changes in F - actin likely mediate CD2AP - dependent spine 306 expansion . Furthermore , the LOAD mutation in CD2AP may modify its function , inducing 307 a build - up of F - actin in the spines . 308 To determine the impact of CD2AP WT or CD2AP K633R overexpression on actin turnover 309 ( Koskinen & Hotulainen , 2014 ) , we measured the rate of actin filament assembly by co - 310 expressing mCherry - actin ( Koestler et al . , 2008 ) and performing fluorescence recovery 311 after photobleaching ( FRAP ) imaging experiments ( Fig . 5I , supplementary FRAP movies ) . 312 Consistent with previous reports ( Koskinen & Hotulainen , 2014 ) , we observed that the 313 fluorescence of mCherry - actin , after photobleaching correction and background 314 subtraction , recovered in GFP expressing spines at 76 % of the prebleached levels ( Fig . 315 5I , K ) . In spines expressing , CD2AP WT mCherry - actin recovered ( 75 % ) similarly to control 316 spines , suggesting that CD2AP WT does not alter the stable fraction of F - actin ( Fig . 5I , K ) . 317 In contrast , mCherry - actin recovery in spines expressing CD2AP K633R was significantly 318 decreased ( 65 % ) compared to spines - expressing GFP and CD2AP WT , suggesting that the 319 LOAD mutation reduces the dynamic actin turnover by increasing the stable fraction of 320 F - actin ( Fig . 5I , K ) . Differently , the half - time of recovery increased in CD2AP WT - expressing 321 spines ( 9 . 5 s ) , and tended to increase in CD2AP K633R - expressing spines ( 10 . 0 s ) compared 322 to GFP - expressing spines ( 6 . 5 s ) , indicative of an increase in the time needed for actin 323 monomers bind to the polymerizing actin filaments , suggesting that CD2AP may 324 sterically interfere with mCherry - actin binding to F - actin or cap the growing F - actin 325 barbed end resulting in a less dynamic actin turnover in spines ( Fig . 5 L ) . To correlate the 326 rate of actin recovery with the head size of the spine , we categorised the spines as small 327 ( < 0 . 2 um 2 ) , intermediate and large ( > 0 . 6 um 2 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . The large GFP control spines 328 tended to recover less , likely more stable , while the larger CD2AP WT and CD2AP K633R 329 expressing spines tended to recover more than larger GFP expressing spines and smaller 330 spines . Interestingly , the intermediate - size spines expressing CD2AP K633R were 331 significantly reduced compared to control or intermediate spines expressing CD2AP WT , 332 supporting an increase in the stability of F - actin , especially in intermediate - size spines 333 ( Fig . S3 ) . 334 335 The CD2AP LOAD mutation does not rescue synapses or spinal F - actin . 336 Finally , we investigated whether the loss of F - actin - positive spines induced by CD2AP 337 depletion could be rescued by the reexpression of CD2AP WT or CD2AP K633R ( Fig . 6 ) . We 338 found that CD2AP WT rescued the reduction in PSD - 95 density induced by shCD2AP - 1 and 339 - 2 to control levels , while in contrast the CD2AP K633R was unable to increase PSD - 95 340 density ( Fig . 6A , B ) . We also evaluated the impact on the PSD - 95 area and observed a 341 similar trend , with only the expression of CD2AP WT significantly increasing the PSD - 95 342 area compared to the neurones treated with shCD2AP - 1 treated neurones ( Fig . 6C ) . 343 We additionally analysed the density and area of F - actin puncta in dendrites . We 344 found that CD2AP WT but not CD2AP K633R rescued F - actin density , similarly to PSD - 95 ( Fig . 345 6D ) . Concerning the F - actin area , the reduction was significant both in shCD2AP - 1 and 346 shCD2AP - 2 treated neurones , and the rescue by CD2AP WT reached significance in 347 shCD2AP - 2 treated neurones ( Fig . 5E ) . 348 These results indicate that CD2AP controls synapses through spine formation and 349 growth and that the LOAD mutation K633R causes loss of function , likely interfering with 350 CD2AP control of spinal F - actin . 351 These results support a new specific function for CD2AP in controlling the balance 352 between F - actin polymerisation and depolymerisation , the actin dynamics required for 353 spine formation and growth . In addition , LOAD mutations may be associated with faulty 354 F - actin dynamics that affects spine formation and growth , compromising synapses . 355 356 Discussion 357 Spines depend on the protrusive force of actin polymerisation for filopodia 358 formation and spine expansion by recruiting postsynaptic scaffolds , such as PSD - 95 , 359 which allow the formation , plasticity , and strength of synapses . Actin - binding proteins 360 regulate the dynamics of F - actin in spines ( Bosch & Hayashi , 2012 ) . Here , we discovered 361 that the Alzheimer ' s disease risk factor CD2AP , an actin - binding protein , is a 362 postsynaptic protein . We localised CD2AP to spines and found that it is required for its 363 formation and expansion , affecting the density of the synapses and the 364 electrophysiological activity of the neurones . CD2AP likely functions in the spines via the 365 actin cytoskeleton , with loss of spinal F - actin while overexpression increased it . Notably , 366 the coding variant in CD2AP ( K633R ) associated with LOAD induces aberrant spine - like 367 formation and expansion . Not being able to rescue the CD2AP knockdown synapse 368 phenotype suggests that the LOAD mutation may cause loss of CD2AP function . The 369 LOAD mutation decreased the FRAP actin recovery , potentially interfering with the 370 depolymerization of F - actin . All these observations support CD2AP as an essential 371 synaptic regulator , which mutation may contribute to LOAD development . 372 How does CD2AP promote spine formation and expansion ? 373 CD2AP is likely a regulator of spine expansion and stabilisation into a functional 374 synapse via F - actin . Notably , CD2AP membrane recruitment is required for actin 375 assembly , which also depends on F - actin ( Spence et al . , 2016 ) . We demonstrated that 376 CD2AP knockdown decreased spinal F - actin . In contrast , overexpression increased 377 dendritic F - actin , supporting that CD2AP promotes F - actin directly ( Lehtonen et al . , 378 2002 ) . CD2AP can cap the barbed ends of F - actin in vitro , inhibiting actin polymerisation 379 and depolymerisation ( Tang & Brieher , 2013 ; Wang & Brieher , 2020 ) . The CD2AP 380 capping of actin filaments can also promote branched F - actin dependent on ARP2 / 3 381 ( Tang & Brieher , 2013 ) , triggering filopodia maturation into spines through spine 382 expansion ( Spence et al . , 2016 ) . CD2AP - dependent expansion can sequentially recruit 383 PSD - 95 , functionalising the spine ( El - Husseini et al . , 2000 ) . In agreement , CD2AP 384 knockdown reduced PSD - 95 , making fewer synapses and compromising neuronal 385 activity . On the contrary , when CD2AP was in excess , PSD - 95 increased in the spines , 386 creating more synapses . 387 CD2AP could act through its interaction partners , cortactin and capping protein ( CP ) , 388 which have known functions in spines via spinal F - actin regulation ( Catarino et al . , 2013 ; 389 Cornelius et al . , 2021 ; Fan et al . , 2011 ; Hering & Sheng , 2003 ) . The CD2AP - cortactin 390 interaction contributes to F - actin stabilisation and accumulation in vivo ( Wang & 391 Brieher , 2020 ) . Cortactin knockdown reduces spine density ( Catarino et al . , 2013 ; 392 Cornelius et al . , 2021 ; Hering & Sheng , 2003 ) , similar to CD2AP knockdown . Cortactin 393 stabilizes the ARP2 / 3 dependent branched F - actin , delays its depolymerisation , and can 394 directly activate the ARP2 / 3 complex ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , supporting a similar role for 395 CD2AP . However , unlike CD2AP , cortactin overexpression leads to longer spines with a 396 minor impact on spine expansion ( Hering & Sheng , 2003 ) , suggesting that CD2AP may 397 function in spines independently . CD2AP - CP interaction inhibits CP ( Bruck et al . , 2006 ; 398 Takeda et al . , 2010 ; Uruno et al . , 2006 ) , which binds actin filaments preventing the 399 addition or loss of actin subunits ( Billault - Chaumartin & Martin , 2019 ) , a nd thus could 400 promote spinal F - actin . However , CP knockdown affects spines differently from CD2AP 401 ( Fan et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that CD2AP functions in spines independently . 402 Nevertheless , the complex regulation of F - actin in dendrites ( Konietzny et al . , 2017 ) and 403 spines ( Honkura et al . , 2008 ) by CD2AP and its interactors will require investigation . 404 Impact of a LOAD mutation in CD2AP on spines 405 The coding mutation in CD2AP ( K633R ) ( rs 116754410 ) was identified in patients 406 with LOAD ( Vardarajan et al . , 2015 ) and recently in children with kidney disease ( Nandlal 407 et al . , 2022 ) . Although predicted to be pathogenic , it is unknown how K633R affects 408 CD2AP in an AD - relevant way . Our data suggest that the CD2AP ( K633R ) mutation 409 induces an aberrant gain of dysfunctional CD2AP in spines , increasing their density and 410 volume , likely due to the increased stability of F - actin in spines , with consequent 411 reduction in spine motility that could explain the impaired capacity to establish more 412 synapses ( Bonhoeffer & Yuste , 2002 ) . Rescue experiments further support that the 413 CD2AP mutant is dysfunctional since it did not rescue the decreased F - actin and PSD - 95 414 density induced by CD2AP knockdown . It will be necessary to determine the impact of 415 the K633R mutation on endogenous CD2AP and in vivo synaptic activity and plasticity to 416 establish how it contributes to AD . 417 CD2AP as a risk factor for AD synaptic dysfunction 418 Carriers of CD2AP coding variants are at higher risk of developing LOAD . 419 Interestingly , while large CD2AP truncations , likely causing CD2AP deletion , cause kidney 420 disease in children , a CD2AP coding mutation was recently associated with kidney 421 disease and mild cognitive decline in adult patients ( Tsvetkov et al . , 2016 ) . The same 422 mutation has also been found in LOAD ( Vardarajan et al . , 2015 ) . 423 Our data suggest that CD2AP coding mutations may only slightly alter CD2AP 424 function , which may enhance AD development with ageing . 425 Thus , it is crucial to determine their impact on synapses and other disease - relevant 426 mechanisms . The most common variants of LOAD are noncoding and are predicted to 427 alter CD2AP expression ; however , it is unknown how CD2AP levels change in the brain . 428 Our data on CD2AP knockdown support the hypothesis that a reduction in CD2AP 429 expression may contribute to synapse loss in AD . 430 However , if CD2AP levels increase , our data suggest that CD2AP may contribute to 431 the hyperexcitability described in early AD ( Vossel et al . , 2016 ) . Regarding the LOAD 432 coding variant in CD2AP ( K633R ) , although we observed that it increases spine density 433 and volume , it does not affect synapse density . Instead , it may affect synaptic plasticity , 434 which requires spine expansion to accommodate the increase in synaptic strength that 435 underlies long - term potentiation and memory ( Bosch & Hayashi , 2012 ) , a hypothesis 436 supported by our result of reduced spine motility of CD2AP mutant spines . 437 Concerning the contribution of CD2AP to Aβ - dependent synapse dysfunction in 438 LOAD , we found that the increase in i ntraneuronal Aβ production induced by CD2AP 439 knockdown in dendrites ( Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ) was insufficient to account for the spine 440 loss observed . These results indicate that CD2AP may cause synaptic dysfunction directly 441 and upstream of Aβ production in early AD . 442 CD2AP may also contribute to the later stages of AD . Indeed , CD2AP has been shown 443 to modulate tau - mediated mechanisms ( Shulman et al . , 2014 ) and the integrity of the 444 blood - brain barrier ( Cochran et al . , 2015 ) and is associated with cognitive functioning in 445 familial AD ( Manzali et al . , 2021 ) . Variations in the CD2AP locus are also associated with 446 the burden of neuritic plaques ( Shulman et al . , 2013 ) . CD2AP - positive neuronal 447 inclusions , resembling neurofibrillary tau tangles , have recently been detected 448 ( Camacho et al . , 2022 ) . 449 450 Conclusion 451 CD2AP is a regulator of actin - rich dendritic spines , contributing to spine formation 452 and expansion , mechanisms relevant to synaptic structural plasticity necessary for 453 memory , profoundly affected in AD ( Herms & Dorostkar , 2016 ) . 454 455 Acknowledgements 456 We thank the gift of plasmids to Dr M .

Briefly , E16 brain tissue was 495 dissociated by trypsinization and trituration in Dulbecco ' s medium Eagle medium 496 ( DMEM , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( heat - inactivated FBS , 497 Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Dissociated neurones plated in DMEM with 10 % FBS on poly - 498 D - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) - coated 6 - well plates ( 3×10 5 cells / cm 2 ) , glass coverslips ( 5×10 4 499 cells / cm 2 ) After 3 - 16 h , the media was substituted for Neurobasal supplemented with 2 500 % B27 ( Gibco ) , or BrainPhys Neuronal Medium ( BrainPhys ) ( Stemcell ) supplemented 501 with 2 % Neurocult SM1 ( Stemcell ) that allows for a more physiological neuronal 502 differentiation and activity ( Bardy et al . , 2015 ) and 0 . 5 % P / S and kept at 37 °C in 5 % 503 CO 2 . Neurones cultured in Neurobasal were used at 21 DIV and BrainPhys at 15 DIV . 504 cDNA transfection and shRNA infection were performed after 12 days in vitro ( DIV ) or 7 505 DIV for neurones cultured in Neurobasal or BrainPhys media , respectively . For rescue 506 experiments , cDNA transfection was performed with 10 DIV neurones ( BrainPhys ) after 507 shRNA infection at 7 DIV . 508 For live cell imaging , primary neurones were grown on 18mm glass bottom plates 509 ( FluoroDish , Thermo Fischer Scientific ; 3x10 5 cells / cm 2 ) . Before imaging , the medium 510 was exchanged for 37 ° C prewarmed imaging medium ( 120 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 2 mM 511 CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM glucose , 10 mM HEPES ) supplemented with B27 . 512 Neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells ( N2a ) ( ATCCCCL - 131 ) were provided by Z .

ShRNA infections were performed 515 24 h after plating for 72 h . 516 For cDNA overexpression , primary neurones were lipotransfected with 517 Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer ' s 518 instructions with a few modifications , 500 ng of DNA per coverslip and neurones were 519 incubated with lipid - cDNA complexes for 5 min at 37 ° C at 5 % CO 2 , and the medium 520 was replaced with conditioned and fresh BrainPhys media . The following cDNA plasmids 521 were used : p - GFP - C1 , Cherry - C1 , CD2AP - GFP and CD2AP - myc ( Cormont et al . , 2003 ) , 522 CD2AP ( K633R ) - GFP and CD2AP ( K633R ) - myc were generated by site - directed 523 mutagenesis with the primer 5 ' GAAATAGCAAAGCTGAAGAAAGCTGTTCTGTTG3 ' and 524 5 ' CAACAGAACAGCTTTCCTCAGCTTTGCTATTTC3 ' , mCherry - actin ( Koestler et al . , 2008 ) . 525 For shRNA infection , the lentivirus vector with yellow fluorescent tag ( YFP ) 526 encoding CD2AP shRNA oligonucleotides sh1 ( shCD2AP - 1 ; GTGGAACCCTGAACAATAAG ) 527 and sh2 ( shCD2AP - 2 , GGAACCAATGAAGATGAACTTACA ) ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) , or vector 528 encoding non - targeting shRNA ( shControl ; TR30021 , OriGene Technologies ) were 529 packed in LV by cotransfection with psPAX2 ( gift from Didier Trono ; Addgene plasmid # 530 12260 ) and pMD2 . G ( gift from Didier Trono ; Addgene plasmid # 12259 ) psPAX2 and 531 helper plasmids in STAR - Rdpro cells ( ECACC 04072117 ) . Lentivirus ( LVs ) were collected 532 by ultra - speed centrifugation and purified with the Lenti - X concentrator ( Takara ) 533 according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . 534 For CD2AP knockdown , cells were incubated with LVs expressing shControl , 535 shCD2AP - 1 , and - 2 for 5 minutes at 37 ° C in 5 % CO 2 . The LV media was replaced with 536 conditioned media and fresh BrainPhys . 537 When indicated , γ - secretase was inhibited with 250 nM γ - secretase inhibitor IX 538 ( Calbiochem ) , while BACE1 was inhibited with 10 µM β - secretase inhibitor compound IV 539 ( Merck - 565788 ) or 0 . 1 % DMSO ( solvent ) as a control . 540 Most experiments were performed with three independent cultures , except 541 when indicated . 542 543 Antibodies and Probes 544 The following primary antibodies were used : anti - CD2AP ( Merck , HPA00326 , 545 1 : 100 ( IF ) ; 1 : 1000 ( WB ) ) ; anti - PSD95 ( D27E11 , Cell Signaling , 3450 , 1 : 200 ( IF ) ; 1 : 2500 546 ( WB ) ) ; anti - synapsin ( Abcam , ab8 , 1 : 200 ( IF ) ; 1 : 2500 ( WB ) ) ; anti - tubulin ( T5168 , Sigma - 547 Aldrich , 1 : 5000 ( WB ) ) ; anti - GFP ( Sicgen , AB0020 , 1 : 200 ( IF ) ) ; anti - vGluT1 ( Merck , 548 MAB5502 , 1 : 100 ( IF ) ) ; anti - cortactin ( p80 / 85 , Merck , 05 - 180 - I - 25UL , 1 : 200 ( IF ) ) ; anti - 549 MAP2 ( Abcam , ab5392 , 1 : 300 ( IF ) ) . The secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa - 550 488 , - 555 , and - 647 ( Invitrogen ) or HRP ( Bio - Rad ) . Phalloidin conjugated to Alexa - 488 , - 551 555 and - 647 ( Invitrogen ) was used to detect F - actin ( 1 : 500 ) . 552 553 Immunofluorescence 554 Immunofluorescence was performed as previously ( Almeida et al . , 2005 ; 555 Ubelmann et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , primary neurones were fixed with 4 % 556 paraformaldehyde / 4 % sucrose in PBS 1x for 20 min , permeabilized with 0 , 3 % Triton - X 557 in PBS 1x for 5 min and blocked with 2 % FBS , 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature 558 ( RT ) before primary antibody incubation for 16 h at 4 ° C . After washing , secondary 559 antibodies were incubated for 1 h at RT . Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount - 560 G ( Southern Biotech ) . 561 562 Labelling of active synapses with FM4 . 64 563 Primary neurones were incubated with the lipophilic dye FM4 . 64 ( 10µM ) 564 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 90 s in a high potassium saline solution ( 119 mM NaCl 565 ( Enzymatic ) , 70 mM KCl ( Enzymatic ) , 2 mM CaCl 2 ( Sigma ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 ( Sigma ) , 5 mM 566 HEPES ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and 30 mM glucose ( NZYtech ) , washed with a low 567 calcium solution saline solution ( 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM CaCl2 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 568 5 mM HEPES and 30 mM Glucose ) with 1 µM tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) ( Tocris ) for 30 s , fixed 569 for 10 min and mounted . 570 571 Immunoblotting 572 Cell lysates were prepared using modified RIPA buffer [ 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 573 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxycholate , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , and 0 . 1 % SDS , with 574 protease inhibitor cocktail ( PIC , Roche ) ] as described ( Burrinha et al . , 2021 ) . Proteins 575 separated by 10 % Tris - glycine SDS – PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes 576 ( GE Healthcare ) and processed for immunoblotting using the ECL Prime kit ( GE 577 Healthcare ) . Immunoblot images were captured using a ChemiDoc Gel Imaging System 578 ( Bio - Rad ) within the linear range and quantified by densitometry using the Analyse gels 579 function in ImageJ . 580 581 Brain synaptosomes preparation 582 Synaptosomes were prepared from the forebrains ( including cortex and 583 hippocampus ) of 6 - month - old ( adult ) C57BL / 6 mice . All steps were performed at 4 ºC . 584 The samples were homogenised with a pestle in ice - cold buffer 1 ( 0 . 32 M sucrose 585 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ; 10 mM HEPES ; 2 mL PIC ( 1X ) ; 1mM EDTA , 1× complete PIC tablet ; pH 586 7 . 4 ; diluted in ddH 2 O ) using 10 ml buffer per gram of tissue . The homogenate was 587 centrifuged ( 10 min , 1000xg , 4ºC ) to obtain a pellet containing nuclear fractions ( P1 ) and 588 the postnuclear supernatant ( S1 ) . S1 was saved and centrifuged ( 15 min , 10000 xg , 4 ºC ) 589 to generate a pellet that contains crude synaptosomes ( P2 ) and a supernatant fraction 590 ( S2 ) . P2 was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer 1 , saved , and centrifuged ( 15 min , 10000 xg , 591 4ºC ) , generating the washed synaptosome fraction ( P2 ' ) . P2 ' was lysed by hypoosmotic 592 shock in ice - cold ddH2O + 10mM HEPES , homogenised with a pestle , and let under head - 593 over - heels rotation at 4ºC for 30 min to ensure complete lysis . P2 ' was further 594 centrifuged ( 30 min , 21000 xg , 4 ºC ) to generate a supernatant that contains crude 595 synaptic vesicles ( S3 ) and a pellet that contains synaptosomal membranes ( P3 ) . P3 was 596 resuspended in 100 μl modified RIPA buffer . 597 598 MEA recordings and analysis 599 Primary neurones were cultured as described above and plated in single - well 600 MEA at a density of 50 , 000 cells in BrainPhys media per well coated with poly - L - ornithine 601 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 16 h at 37 ºC and laminin ( Sigma ) for 4 h . Primary neurones were 602 transduced with lentivirus expressing shCD2AP - 1 , shCD2AP - 2 or shControl as described . 603 Each MEA well ( 3Brain Prime HD - MEA ) contained 4096 recording electrodes coupled to 604 a ground electrode . MEA recordings of basal neuronal network activity were performed 605 at 15 DIV for 30 s at 37 ° C using the BioCamX recording system and BrainWave v . 4 . 5 606 software ( 3Brain ) . 607 Spikes were detected with the analysis tool " spike detection " of the BrainWave 608 software . The precise timing spike detection ( PTSD ) algorithm was used to detect 609 negative spikes , with SD of 8 . 0 , 2 . 0 ms peak lifetime and 1 . 0 ms refractory period . For 610 the quantification of active electrodes , we considered the ones with a minimum an 611 average firing rate of 3 spikes / second in percentage of the total ( 4096 ) . The average 612 firing rate refers to the total number of spikes per 30 s of recording . Spiking frequency 613 refers to the number of spikes detected by each electrode per 30 s recording . The 614 cumulative frequency of the firing rate was calculated using Prism 8 . 0 . Bursts were 615 detected by the " burst detector " analysis tool , with a maximum spike interval of 30 ms 616 and a minimum number of 5 spikes . The burst rate was calculated by dividing the total 617 bursts by 30 s of recording . The number and duration of network bursts , synchronised 618 bursts , spiking frequency of network bursts , interburst intervals , and spiking frequency 619 were calculated using Brainwave v4 . 620 621 Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) 622 To measure F - actin FRAP in spines , primary neurones were transfected with GFP , 623 CD2AP - GFP , CD2AP ( K633R ) - GFP , and mCherry - actin . GFP . GFP and mCherry - actin were 624 imaged using the LSM980 the 63× NA - 1 . 4 oil Plan - Apochromat objective at 37 ° C , and 625 FRAP was performed using the ZEN ( Blue 3 . 3 edition : Zeiss ) bleaching module . ROIs of 626 12 pixels in diameter were placed on 3 - 6 spines per dendritic segment . Cells were 627 imaged at 1 frame per 1 - 4 s in a single plane . After five baseline frames , ROIs were 628 photobleached and imaged for 2 min , allowing recovery to reach a stable plateau . FRAP 629 analysis of mCherry - actin fluorescence intensity in bleached spines was performed as 630 described ( Koulouras et al . , 2018 ) using EasyFRAP - web ( freely accessible platform - 631 independent ; https : / / easyfrap . vmnet . upatras . gr / ) . Briefly , fluorescence was 632 background subtracted , corrected for photobleaching and baseline normalised to 100 % 633 for each photobleached spine . FRAP recovery and half - time were calculated by fitting 634 an exponential curve . 635 636 Image acquisition 637 Images were acquired on an epifluorescence microscope , the Zeiss Imager Z2 638 system ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) equipped with a 20x air EC Plan - Neofluar 639 objective 63× NA - 1 . 4 oil Plan - Apochromat objective and a Zeiss Axiocam 506 mono 640 camera , and on a confocal microscope with super - resolution , LSM980 – AiryScan 2 641 ( Zeiss ) equipped with 63× NA - 1 . 4 oil Plan - Apochromat objective . 3D z - stacks were 642 acquired to enable 3D reconstructions as indicated . The samples were imaged in parallel 643 and using identical acquisition parameters for direct comparison . 644 645 Quantitative Bioimaging Analyses 646 Image analysis was carried out using Fiji ( ImageJ 1 . 53 , https : / / fiji . sc / ) , ICY 647 ( icy . bioimageanalysis . org ( de Chaumont et al . , 2012 ) , or IMARIS ( version 9 . 5 . 0 ) 648 ( https : / / imaris . oxinst . com / ) . 649 For the quantification of spinal enrichment , spinal and dendritic F - actin , ICY was 650 used to outline a region of interest ( ROI ) corresponding to a dendritic section manually 651 or automatically based on the GFP signal and outline spines , either by selecting spines 652 with the " ellipse " selection tool or subtracting the dendritic shaft from the dendritic ROI . 653 Each ROI ' s fluorescence mean intensity and area were obtained with ICY ROI 654 measurements . Spinal enrichment was obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity 655 in the spine ROI by the fluorescence intensity in the dendritic ROI and presented as a 656 percentage . Spinal F - actin puncta was segmented using the ICY " Spot detector " module 657 in the spines ROI , and each puncta area was obtained using ICY ROI measurements . 658 For the quantification of vGluT1 , PSD - 95 and FM4 . 64 puncta density or size , 659 dendritic ROIs were outlined with the ICY ' Area ' selection tool , puncta were segmented 660 with the ICY " Spot detector " module and ROI ' s measurements were exported as 661 previously including the dendrite ROI length ( Feret ' s diameter ) ( Burrinha et al . , 2021 ) . 662 Alternatively , dendritic ROIs were outlined using the ' polygon selection ' tool on FIJI , and 663 the " ComDet v . 0 . 5 . 5 " plugin was used for segmentation , colocalisation considering the 664 max distance between objects less than 5 pixels , and the other measurements as 665 previously ( Burrinha et al . , 2023 ) . 666 For the Sholl analysis , single pyramidal neurones expressing GFP were 3D 667 reconstructed using IMARIS ' Filament Tracer . The Filament Sholl analysis was used to 668 quantify neurite number , intersections , and length . 669 To quantify spine density volume , IMARIS " Filament Tracer " was used to 3D 670 reconstruct dendrites based on the GFP ( shRNA ) or mCherry ( OE ) signal . The spine 671 module automatically detects spines and provides spine head volume . When automatic 672 detection was impossible , spine density was manually counted using the point selection 673 tool in FIJI . 674 To quantify spine motility , dendrites were 4D reconstructed , and the spine 675 volume was measured using IMARIS in dendrites imaged live 1 frame every 30 s for 30 676 min . The spine motility index was measured as described ( Dunaevsky et al . , 1999 ) with 677 slight modifications . Briefly , the motility index was obtained for each spine by calculating 678 the ratio of the difference between the largest and smallest spine volume to the average 679 spine volume during the time - lapse . 680 681 Statistics 682 Prism 8 ( GraphPad ) was used for statistical analysis and for graphic 683 representation of individual or average replicates with mean ± S . D . as indicated in the 684 figure legends . The sample size was determined on the basis of pilot studies . Data were 685 tested with the D ' Agostino - Pearson omnibus normality test . For paired data , the 686 Wilcoxon t - test was applied . For nonparametric and unpaired data , the Mann – Whitney 687 test was applied . For parametric and multiple comparisons , statistical analysis of data 688 ordinary one - way ANOVA with Holm - Sidlak ' s multiple comparisons test was applied . For 689 nonparametric and multiple comparison statistical data analysis , one - way ANOVA 690 ( Kruskal - Wallis test ) with post hoc Dunn ' s testing was applied . Significance was 691 considered as * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ; ns , not significant . 692 693 References 694 Almeida CG , Tampellini D , Takahashi RH , Greengard P , Lin MT , Snyder EM & Gouras GK 695 ( 2005 ) Beta - amyloid accumulation in APP mutant neurones reduces PSD - 95 and 696 GluR1 in synapses .
