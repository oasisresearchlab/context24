De Camilli , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , and approved January 14 , 2003 ( received for review July 15 , 2002 ) To investigate the role of clathrin in coated vesicle formation , a cell line with inducible expression of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) anti - sense RNA was produced . After 18 h of CHC antisense RNA expression , theinternalizationoftransferrinwasinhibitedby90 % . Although the amount of CHC was reduced by only 10 % , the frequency of clathrin - coated pits at the cell surface increased by a factor of 3 – 5 , and clathrin - coated structures also accumulated on a pleiomorphic , multivesicular , endosomal compartment . Remark - ably , the coated pits were connected to the cell surface by long , tubular necks wrapped by dynamin rings , and the level of dynamin in the CHC antisense RNA - expressing cells was up - regulated 10 - fold . In contrast , the amount of several other proteins associated with clathrin coat formation was unaffected . Thus , this study demonstrates that CHC antisense RNA causes accumulation of clathrin - coated pits with dynamin rings around the neck in intact cells not transfected with dynamin mutants , suggesting the exis - tenceofapreviouslyuncharacterizedfunctionalinterplaybetween clathrin and dynamin . C lathrin coats are involved in a variety of transport processes , and different ways to interfere with clathrin - dependent steps are of interest in elucidating mechanisms of coat and vesicle formation and in clarifying functions of clathrin coats on various organelles . At the plasma membrane , clathrin - coated pits are involved in uptake of receptors and ligands . Clathrin also is present in the trans - Golgi network and on lysosomes and endo - somes ( 1 , 2 ) . In the perinuclear recycling compartment , clathrin may be involved in both transport to the Golgi apparatus ( 3 ) and transferrin receptor recycling ( 4 ) . Flat clathrin - coated microdo - mains could function to sort ubiquitinated membrane proteins destined for degradation ( 5 , 6 ) . Furthermore , clathrin may be important for early endosome distribution ( 7 ) . The exact mechanism ( s ) involved in formation of clathrin - coated vesicles is not known , but molecules such as dynamin , endophilin , and epsin ( 8 ) all might be involved . Several ap - proaches have been used to inhibit vesicle formation from clathrin - coated structures ( 9 ) . Recently , overexpression of mu - tant proteins or protein domains has been used to block clathrin - dependent endocytosis , but this method is likely to affect more than one function . For instance , overexpression of mutant dynamin ( K44A ) will inhibit not only uptake from clathrin - coated pits but also other types of endocytosis ( 10 ) . Futhermore , overexpression of protein domains might lead to low - affinity interactions that normally do not occur , thereby depleting the cytosol of interacting proteins required for other functions . It is therefore useful to apply methods based on different principles . To investigate the importance of clathrin , we have established a cell line with inducible expression of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) antisense RNA . In the present article we demonstrate some unexpected results concerning regulation of dynamin levels and accumulation of clathrin - coated structures . Materials and Methods Materials .

Western Blot Analysis . For analysis of clathrin and tubulin ( as internal standard ) , cells were scraped off the plastic and lysed in Mes buffer ( 0 . 1 M Mes , pH 6 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 (cid:1) 1 mM EGTA (cid:1) 20 (cid:2) M leupeptin (cid:1) 1 mM PMSF (cid:1) 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ) . Samples were resolved on a 7 . 5 % SDS (cid:1) PAGE gel under reducing conditions . The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose ( Schleicher & Schuell ) , and the membrane was blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 . For analysis of the different accessory proteins playing a role in clathrin - coated pit formation , cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 8 (cid:1) 150 mM NaCl (cid:1) 1 % deoxycholate (cid:1) 0 . 1 % SDS (cid:1) 1 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with the Complete protease inhibitor mixture ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Samples were resolved on 10 – 12 . 5 % SDS (cid:1) PAGE gels , and the proteins were trans - ferred to poly ( vinylidene difluoride ) membranes ( Millipore ) . The filters were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature , washed three times for 10 min with 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , and finally incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 45 min at room temperature . The results were developed with a chemilu - minescent detection kit ( Pierce ) . Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Immunoprecipitation . The cells were starved for 30 min in DMEM lacking Met (cid:1) Cys . [ 35 S ] Met (cid:1) [ 35 S ] Cys ( Expre 35 S 35 S label ) was added to the medium ( 75 (cid:2) Ci (cid:1) ml ; 1 Ci (cid:1) 37 GBq ) , and the cells were incubated for another 30 min . The cells were then scraped off and lysed in a Mes buffer containing 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( see Western Blot Analysis ) . The cell lysate was aspirated six times through a 21 - gauge needle , incubated on ice for 20 min , and centrifuged at 6 , 800 (cid:2) g for 10 min at 4°C . The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by using the Protein Assay kit ( Bio - Rad ) . One hundred micrograms of total protein was im - munoprecipitated with goat anti - CHC ( 30 (cid:2) l ) bound to protein G agarose ( 25 (cid:2) l ) for 24 h at 4°C on a rotating platform . Immunocomplexes were washed four times with 500 (cid:2) l of TBS buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 6 (cid:1) 0 . 5M NaCl ) , resuspended in sample buffer , and separated on a 7 . 5 % SDS (cid:1) PAGE gel under reducing conditions . For degradation experiments , cells were plated and incubated overnight before they were transferred to Met - and Cys - free medium . A mixture of [ 35 S ] Met (cid:1) [ 35 S ] Cys ( 10 (cid:2) Ci (cid:1) ml ) was added , and the cells were incubated for another 24 h in the presence of tet . The cells then were incubated in normal medium without tet , in the presence or absence of lactacystin ( 10 (cid:2) M ) for 24 h . Cell lysates were prepared , and CHC was immunoprecipitated , as described above . Radioactive bands were visualized by fluorog - raphy , and quantification was performed by using a scanning densitometer . The rate of dynamin synthesis was measured by a metabolic pulse labeling experiment . Cells grown for 2 days with or without tet were Met (cid:1) Cys - starved for 30 min . Then they were pulsed with [ 35 S ] Met (cid:1) [ 35 S ] Cys ( 75 (cid:2) Ci (cid:1) ml ) for 30 min and chased in com - plete DMEM (cid:1) 10 % FCS for 10 min . The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 3 , 800 (cid:2) g for 10 min . Cell lysates were incubated with 20 (cid:2) l of protein A Sepharose prebound to anti - dynamin ( 5 (cid:2) l of Hudy 1 ) . Immunocomplexes were washed with RIPA buffer and resolved by using a 10 % SDS / PAGE gel . The gel was exposed to PhosphorImager screens and ana - lyzed by using PHOSPHORIMAGER and IMAGEQUANT software ( Molecular Dynamics ) . Measurements of Endocytosis and Recycling . Endocytosis of trans - ferrin was measured after a 5 - min incubation at 37°C with 125 I - transferrin ( (cid:3) 100 ng (cid:1) ml ) in Hepes medium . The cells were washed with ice - cold Hepes and then treated with pronase ( 2 mg (cid:1) ml ) in Hepes medium for 1 h on ice . The cells were removed from the incubation medium by centrifugation , and the radio - activity in the cell pellet ( endocytosed transferrin ) and in the supernatant ( surface - bound transferrin ) was measured . Recy - cling of transferrin was measured by using TAG - and biotin - labeled transferrin as described ( 15 ) . Sorting and Processing of Cathepsin D . The assay was performed as described ( 25 ) : The cells were starved for Met (cid:1) Cys for 30 min , pulsed with [ 35 S ] Met (cid:1) [ 35 S ] Cys for 30 min , and chased for various time periods in the presence of mannose - 6 - phosphate ( 5 mM ) to inhibit endocytosis of released enzyme . Metabolically labeled cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and media . The relative amounts of procathepsin D and mature forms of cathepsin D were determined by SDS (cid:1) PAGE , autora - diography , and densitometry . Electron Microscopy . The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde and 2 % formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 , followed by dehydration and embed - ding in Epon . Alternatively , the fixed cells were processed for ultracryosections and subsequent ImmunoGold labeling to lo - calize dynamin ( 16 ) . In some experiments , cells were fixed in the presence of ruthenium red ( 0 . 5 mg (cid:1) ml ) before they were washed and embedded in Epon ( 16 ) . Finally , some cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with horseradish peroxidase ( 5 mg (cid:1) ml ; Sigma type II ) before fixation as described ( 16 ) . Sections were analyzed with a Philips 100 CM electron microscope ( Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) . RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis . Total RNA was iso - lated by using the RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) , was run on a 1 % agarose gel with formaldehyde , and finally was blotted onto a Hybond - N membrane ( Amersham Biosciences ) . The probe for dynamin 2 detection was generated by labeling the entire cDNA of dynamin 2 with Redivue [ (cid:1) - 32 P ] dCTP by using the Random Primers DNA labeling system ( Invitrogen ) . Hybridization was done overnight at 60°C . Results and Discussion Synthesis of CHC Is Reduced in Cells Expressing CHC Antisense RNA . Here we have used a tet - controlled expression system that is tightly regulated ( 17 ) to produce BHK cells with inducible expression of CHC antisense RNA . The maximum level of expression of the inserted gene in this system is (cid:3) 48 h ( 12 , 18 ) . The synthesis of CHC in different experiments was reduced by 25 – 40 % after 48 h of CHC antisense RNA expression ( Fig . 1 A ) . As shown by Western blot analyses , the protein level was reduced by 50 % after 2 days of induction , and after 4 days of induction the level was reduced to 28 % ( Fig . 1 B ) . In this experiment we used an anti - CHC that recognized an epitope close to the C - terminal end of the protein . The reduction of CHC was similar when an anti - CHC against the N - terminal part of the protein was used ( data not shown ) . After 24 h of induction , a reduction in the CHC level was barely detectable , a finding that agrees with earlier results demonstrating that the half - life of CHC is rather long ( 19 ) . Furthermore , total RNA was extracted from cells grown in the absence or presence of tet for 2 and 4 days . After 2 days , the reduction in the endogenous CHC mRNA level was (cid:3) 50 % of control cells . After 4 days there was no detectable CHC mRNA ( data not shown ) . Transferrin Trafficking in CHC Antisense RNA - Producing Cells . Trans - ferrin endocytosis was inhibited significantly after 16 h of CHC antisense RNA expression , and after 48 h the transferrin endo - cytosis was reduced by 90 – 95 % ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . This level remained constant when the cells were incubated for up to 6 days 5176 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0534231100 Iversen et al . ( data not shown ) . The inhibition of transferrin endocytosis was accompanied by an increased binding of transferrin ( 2 - to 3 - fold ) at the plasma membrane ( data not shown ) , suggesting that recycling of the internalized transferrin receptor continued although the uptake became blocked . The rapid inhibition of transferrin uptake could be due to partial cleavage of clathrin molecules that might interfere ( pos - sibly in a dominant negative manner ) with the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles . We therefore investigated whether lac - tacystin , an inhibitor of proteolysis , could counteract degrada - tion of clathrin and the inhibition of transferrin endocytosis , and indeed this was the case . A pulse – chase experiment showed that incubation with lactacystin decreased the degradation of clathrin ( Fig . 1 E ) . Western blot analysis revealed an increased clathrin level when cells were grown without tet and in the presence of lactacystin ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , the reduction in transferrin endocytosis was partially abrogated by lactacystin ( Fig . 1 F ) . Lactacystin is an inhibitor of proteasomes ( 20 ) and of a newly characterized giant protease , tripeptidyl peptidase II ( TPPII ) , possessing both the ability to remove tripeptides from the N terminus and an endoprotease activity ( 21 ) . Although the effect of lactacystin might be indirect , the data are compatible with the idea that proteolytic processing of preexisting clathrin molecules might be involved in inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Effect of CHC Antisense RNA Expression on Transport and Maturation of Cathepsin D . The lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D is normally transported by a clathrin - dependent pathway from the Golgi apparatus to endosomes , where it is processed to a mature form . To test whether this pathway was affected by expression of CHC antisense RNA , we studied the kinetics of procathepsin D maturation . Induced expression of CHC antisense RNA inhib - ited the formation of mature cathepsin D by 50 % after a 4 - h chase ( Fig . 1 G ) , and there was a 5 - fold increase in extracellular secretion of procathepsin D ( Fig . 1 G ) . Furthermore , the rate of procathepsin D synthesis was increased (cid:3) 2 - fold . Lysosomes seemed normal by electron microscopy after 2 days of CHC antisense RNA induction , probably because of the high stability of lysosomal enzymes . However , 4 days of induction led to formation of very large lysosomes containing a lot of internal membrane ( data not shown ) . Their formation is most likely a consequence of impaired transport (cid:1) maturation of lysosomal enzymes . Fig . 1 .

The effect of CHC antisense RNA expression on clathrin - associated structures at the plasma membrane and on endosomes was examined at the ultrastruc - tural level . Numerous clathrin - coated pits and vesicular profiles were noticed at the cell surface ( Fig . 2 ) . The clathrin coats appeared structurally normal , even when cut tangentially , where the characteristic honeycomb - like pattern was evident ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . Their diameter varied from 80 to 150 nm . They often formed aggregates ( Fig . 2 C – E ) and appeared to be connected to the cell surface by long tubules ( necks ) with a diameter of 25 – 30 nm . These tubules often showed a cross - striation with a periodicity of (cid:3) 20 nm ( Fig . 2 ) . It turned out that virtually all clathrin - coated profiles at the cell surface were indeed con - nected to the cell surface , because they were stained by ruthe - nium red added during fixation ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . Small vesicular profiles with a diameter of (cid:3) 30 nm were often also stained by ruthenium red . These may represent cross - sectioned tubules . There appeared to be roughly one striated tubule per three to four clathrin - coated vesicular profiles . However , whereas the clathrin - coated vesicular profiles are readily identified no matter the section plane , the striated tubules can be identified unequiv - ocally only in longitudinal sections . Because many tubules will be cross - sectioned , we find it likely that there is close to one tubule per clathrin - coated pit or aggregate of pits . The number of clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface in CHC antisense RNA - expressing cells from 2 to 6 days of induction was quan - tified and found to be 3 - to 5 - fold higher than in control cells ( Table 1 ) . Similarly , the number of striated tubules appeared constant from 2 to 6 days of induction . Thus , CHC still present at this time is able to form coat structures , but the coated pits cannot pinch off . Whether these coated structures contain some partially cleaved molecules interfering with normal clathrin function is not known . The first signs of multiple coated pit Fig . 2 . Representative examples of clathrin - coated vesicular structures at the cell surface of BHK21 - tTA (cid:1) anti - CHC cells expressing CHC antisense RNA for 2 – 4 days . The clathrin - coated structures often form clusters . Moreover , they are frequently connected to the cell surface by long tubules . These tubules show a cross - striation ( indicated in G and H ) . Arrowheads in A and B show the characteristic honeycomb - like pattern of tangentially sectioned clathrin - coated pits (cid:1) vesicles . ( Bar (cid:1) 200 nm . ) 5178 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0534231100 Iversen et al . structures and some formation of striated tubules were noticed after 18 h of CHC antisense RNA induction , suggesting that their formation correlated with inhibition of endocytosis . The cross - striated 20 - to 30 - nm tubules connecting the clath - rin - coated pits to the cell surface in CHC antisense RNA - expressing cells resemble the dynamin - wrapped necks of clath - rin - coated structures found in permeabilized synaptosomes after incubation with guanosine 5 (cid:5) - [ (cid:3) - thio ] triphosphate ( 22 ) , or upon overexpression of mutant dynamin ( 8 ) . Thus , we incubated ultracryosections of CHC antisense RNA - expressing cells with an anti - dynamin antibody ( Hudy 1 ) . This antibody not only labeled the clathrin coats as reported ( 16 , 18 ) , but also the tubular structures ( Fig . 3 C – E ) . Thus , in CHC antisense RNA - expressing cells , clathrin - coated pits accumulated at the cell surface , connected to the plasma membrane via long , dynamin - wrapped necks . The reason for this phenotype is not obvious but could depend on , although it is not caused by , the increased expression of endogenous dynamin ( see below ) . Another striking structural effect of antisense - CHC expres - sion was a highly pleiomorphic , multivesicular compartment ( Fig . 4 ) . This compartment was not associated with the cell surface , because it was not stained after fixation with ruthenium red ( data not shown ) . In contrast , it contained internalized horseradish peroxidase ( data not shown ) , and we therefore consider it a modified endosome compartment . This multive - sicular compartment was associated with numerous 70 - to 120 - nm clathrin - coated vesicular structures ( which were rarely observed on endosomes in control cells ) ( Fig . 4 ) . This image is reminiscent of images observed in shibire nerve terminals during Fig . 3 .

Interestingly , in con - trast to the situation at the plasma membrane , the endosome - associated clathrin - coated pits never showed tubular neck or ring structures , even though a high level of dynamin was present in the cytosol ( see below ) , suggesting differences in the mechanism of vesicle formation at the two donor membranes . Despite accumulation of clathrin on endosomes , endocytosed transferrin seemed to be exocytosed at a normal rate ( data not shown ) . Dynamin Synthesis Is Increased upon CHC Antisense RNA Expression . The observation of accumulated clathrin - coated pits in the CHC antisense RNA cells made us investigate expression levels of different proteins participating in clathrin - coated vesicle forma - tion ( 24 ) . Western blot analysis revealed that the steady - state level of dynamin was increased (cid:3) 20 - fold , whereas there was no change in the other proteins investigated ( clathrin light chain , AP1 , AP2 , Eps15 , epsin , amphiphysin , and endophilin ; data not shown ) . Furthermore , the synthesis of dynamin was found to be up - regulated (cid:3) 10 - fold as determined by a metabolic pulse experiment ( Fig . 5 A ) . This increase also was reflected in differ - ent Northern blot analysis experiments . An (cid:3) 5 - fold higher level of dynamin 2 mRNA in the CHC antisense RNA - expressing cells is demonstrated in Fig . 5 B . Interestingly , the time course of this increased level of dynamin corresponded to the time course of the inhibition of transferrin endocytosis ( data not shown ) , as if the cells tried to counteract the inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Such an up - regulation might be required for for - mation of dynamin rings in the cells studied here , but it is clearly not the explanation for this phenotype . Immunofluorescence microscopy of the uninduced BHK21 - tTA (cid:1) anti - CHC cells tran - siently overexpressing hemagglutinin - tagged dynamin 2 wild type displayed no inhibition in uptake of Cy3 - labeled transferrin ( data not shown ) . This agrees with previous studies of wild - type dynamin overexpression ( 18 ) . In conclusion , despite an increased level of dynamin in the cells expressing CHC antisense RNA , dynamin at the neck of clathrin - coated pits in our CHC antisense RNA cells is not sufficient for release of vesicles . The function of dynamin in fission might require a critical level of clathrin or recently synthesized intact clathrin . Interestingly , our data suggest a new and unexpected link between synthesis of CHC and dynamin .
