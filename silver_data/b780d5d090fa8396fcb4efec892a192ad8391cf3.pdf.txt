For years , it was assumed that this was the extent of the coats ’ function and that the coats depolymerized immediately after vesicle budding , leaving the exposed fusion machinery free to find , dock , and fuse with the proper target membrane . Recently , however , it has become increasingly clear that the coat remains on transport vesicles during their post - budding life and in fact helps properly pair up the vesicle with its intended target membrane . These data have brought up urgent questions about exactly when vesicles do uncoat and how uncoating is regulated . Here , we summarize the latest round of evidence for post - budding roles for coats , including a few hints about how the uncoating process may be coupled to docking and fusion . We also speculate about the possibility of post - fusion functions for residual coats . Introduction and context Vesicular transport Intracellular protein transport is , in part , vesicle - mediated with biochemically distinct vesicles trafficking along different routes . Three well - studied examples include clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) ( plasma mem - brane endocytosis , transport from trans - Golgi network [ TGN ] to endosomes and lysosomes ) , coat protein complex II ( COPII ) vesicles ( endoplasmic reticulum [ ER ] to Golgi ) , and COPI vesicles ( intra - Golgi and Golgi to ER ) . These diverse vesicles are formed by fundamen - tally similar processes involving ( a ) protein cargo selection through cargo receptors ; ( b ) cargo receptor interaction with inner - coat subunits coordinated or monitored by GTPases of the Arf family ( COPI vesicles and CCVs formed in the TGN ) , Sar family ( COPII vesicles ) , or dynamin family ( endocytic CCVs ) ; ( c ) recruitment of outer - coat subunits by the cargo - bound inner coat ; ( d ) membrane curvature ; and ( e ) vesicle scission / budding . Newly budded coated vesicles move ( often through interactions with the cytoskeleton ) , encounter target membranes through specific tethering protein interactions that involve Rab GTPases , and then undergo SNARE ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ) - mediated membrane fusion , delivering their cargo to the appropriate target compartment . The conventional view of uncoating A priori , one can imagine that vesicle coats would be a physical impediment to subsequent membrane fusion , so considerable attention has been given to how coats come off . Experiments with COPII coats in the 1990s suggested that , in fact , uncoating takes place soon after budding , leading to an informal consensus that uncoated vesicles are the substrate for tethering and fusion . How did this picture , which now appears to be inaccurate , develop ? The formation of a COPII - coated vesicle is initiated by the ER - localized guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for the Sar1 GTPase ( Sec12 ) , which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Sar1 . This exchange results in a conformational change in Sar1 , exposing an amphipathic alpha - helical membrane - bind - ing domain . Membrane - bound Sar1 - GTP recruits the inner - coat subunits Sec23 / 24 , which in turn recruit the outer subunits Sec13 / 31 .

This conclusion was supported by experiments in permeabilized mammalian cells [ 2 ] , where it was found that if Sar1 GTPase activity was inhibited , the vesicle retained its COPII coat . Real - time monitoring of the coat assembly and disassembly processes using liposomes [ 3 ] with purified coat subunits confirmed that , indeed , Sec23 stimulated the GTPase activity of Sar1 , which initiated coat disassembly . In addition , the GAP activity of Sec23 activity was itself enhanced 10 - fold by Sec13 binding ( i . e . , assembly of the outer coat ) . In the COPI system , GTP hydrolysis by Arf1 was required for coat release and vesicle fusion [ 4 ] . Positive membrane curvature ( i . e . , forming the spherical vesicle ) was shown to increase the ability of ArfGAP1 to stimulate the GTPase activity of Arf1 and trigger COPI coat disassembly [ 5 ] . Coupled with a lack of any data implying that the coat stays on , all of these findings together naturally led to a model wherein the state of the coat is regulated by the GTP cycle of the small GTPases , which in turn is regulated by associated GEFs and GAPs : in other words , when Sar1 or Arf1 is GTP - bound , the coat comes on , and when it is GDP - bound , the coat comes off . As illustrated in the following sections , newer and more physiological data argue that coats stay on ( at least partially ) until at least the tethering step . We must therefore amend our view of the meaning of the GTPase cycle in vesicle uncoating . While beyond the focus of the present review , we will briefly outline two addi - tional functions for Sar / Arf GTP hydrolysis that under - score its importance in steps prior to uncoating . These functions are ( a ) ‘ proof - reading ’ the cargo selection process and ( b ) actuating vesicle fission . The role in cargo selection was suggested by work with cargo - spiked COPII liposomes and planar membranes [ 6 , 7 ] . During formation of prebudding complexes comprised of Sar1 - GTP and Sec23 / 24 , the Sec24 subunit is free to interact with transmembrane cargo . In the absence of cargo , Sec23 / 24 stimulates the GTPase activity of Sar1 and both Sec23 / 24 and Sar1 - GDP are released from membranes . However , in the presence of cargo , Sec23 / 24 remains membrane - associated for multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis and Sar1 release . Furthermore , multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis appear to drive accumulation of cargo in prebudding complexes and exclusion of non - cargo molecules . These in vitro experi - ments are supported by in vivo analysis of COPII subunit turnover at single ER exit sites in living cells [ 8 ] , where decreasing the available cargo results in a decreased residence time of Sec23 / 24 on the membrane . A requirement for GTP hydrolysis in the fission of the budded vesicle has been proposed for CCVs [ 9 ] , COPI vesicles [ 10 ] , and COPII vesicles [ 11 ] . So while the GAP and GTPase activities may play a less central role in uncoating than we thought , they clearly have plenty to do with cargo sorting and vesicle fission . Major recent advances Coats are retained at least through the initiation of tethering Since coats physically interact with cargo proteins , lipids , accessory factors , and themselves , it is not surprising that they can hang on to membranes after vesicle fission . Furthermore , over the last several years , the conventional uncoating model has been challenged by numerous studies demonstrating interactions between coat sub - units and tethers or other components of the target membrane . The key advance was the realization , established using in vitro reconstitutions of heterotypic and homotypic COPII vesicle tethering , that these interactions were functionally important for the tether - ing step per se [ 12 ] . This work formed a functional basis for numerous other examples of coat - tether interactions to be interpreted along the same lines . Table 1 summarizes nine instances from work on functionally distinct coated vesicles in both yeast and mammalian systems . The notes are included to highlight particularly strong evidence that the proposed coat - tether interaction is required for the delivery or consumption of transport vesicles . An earlier functional result from permeabilized yeast cells – that excess COPII inner - shell protein Sec23 inhibited fusion but not tethering – is compatible with the apparent functional role of Sec23 in targeting COPII vesicles [ 13 ] . Altogether , this literature suggests that the coat is at least partially retained on vesicles in the cytosol and that this residual coat participates in at least the initiation of tethering . Advances in the last year on the study of yeast retrograde Golgi to ER transport are worthy of extra discussion . At this transport step , COPI vesicles dock and fuse with the ER via the Dsl1 tethering complex . The 2009 papers from this system together make a compelling case that , as shown with COPII coats , COPI coats linger on vesicles in the cytosol and may play an important role in vesicle targeting . First , Schmitt ’ s group [ 14 ] mapped multiple interactions between the Dsl1 tether subunit and COPI subunits comprising both the inner and outer shell of the coat . When living yeasts were depleted of the Dsl1 subunit , heavily coated COPI vesicles accumulated , just as would be predicted if the tethering step preceded and was a prerequisite for uncoating . The authors speculated that , in addition to mediating the tethering event itself via COPI binding , the Dsl1p complex might be involved Page 2 of 6 ( page number not for citation purposes ) F1000 Biology Reports 2010 , 2 : 47 http : / / f1000 . com / reports / biology / content / 2 / 47 in disassembly of the coat at the target membrane . Meanwhile , a structural study on the Dsl1 complex provided a very congruent model of Dsl1 - mediated tethering [ 15 ] . The Dsl1 complex is shaped like a two - legged tower with the Dsl1 subunit at the peak . Both legs of the tower , which are comprised of subunits Sec39 and Tip20 , are anchored at the ER membrane by their interactions with the N - terminal domains of the ER SNAREs Use1 and Sec20 , respectively . The Dsl1 subunit positioned at the apex of the tower is presumed to reach a height of 20 nm above the vesicle surface and contains within it an unstructured , flexible ‘ lasso ’ region . The lasso region contains the sites responsible for COPI interactions – perfectly poised to grab passing COPI vesicles and keep them near the ER until all four SNARES ( Use1 , Sec20 , and Ufe1 on the ER , and Sec22 on the vesicle ) can assemble a fusogenic four - helix bundle . While elegant , the Dsl1 - COPI vesicle tethering model remains to be functionally verified . The recent advances from this system and the others listed in Table 1 [ 16 - 24 ] bring into focus major questions about transport vesicle uncoating : Is the quantity of residual coat required for tethering sufficient to block SNARE engagement or membrane fusion ( or both ) ? If so , what components and events cause release of the ‘ excess ’ coat ? Future directions Future research will undoubtedly focus on trying to pin down exactly how vesicle uncoating is spatio - temporally regulated . On the one hand , full uncoating cannot precede tethering since multiple tethers apparently rely upon coats as a basis for assembly and specificity . On the other hand , at least some uncoating or coat destabiliza - tion must precede trans - SNARE pairing since otherwise the coat would render the SNAREs functionally inacces - sible . Clearly , the uncoating process must be regulated . When and where does uncoating take place ? Figure 1 is a speculative model for uncoating events and their relationship to tethering and fusion . Vesicle uncoating may occur at one or more of several phases in trafficking . As originally envisioned , uncoating may begin in the cytosol soon after budding ( labeled ‘ 1 ’ ) . Cytosolic factors that promote uncoating may include Hsc70s [ 25 - 27 ] , Rabs ( membrane GTPases that can be recruited from a cytosolic pool ) and their effectors [ 28 ] , and other factors that promote coat post - translational modifications [ 28 - 30 ] . However , the new advances discussed above argue that , although cytosolic uncoating could be significant , it cannot be complete ; functional necessity demands that some coat be present during the tethering event itself . Coat stabilizers such as the EF - hand - containing Sec31 - binding protein ALG - 2 ( apoptosis - linked gene 2 ) could act to counteract the uncoating , retaining more coat to promote tethering , delay fusion , or regulate subsequent membrane - mixing steps [ 31 ] . Key questions are how much coat remains during the tethering step and whether this amount is compatible with fusion . Unfortunately , a rigorous quantitative picture of the remaining coat in a tethered but unfused stage is not available . By way of approxima - tion , immuno - isolated mammalian COPII vesicles , the large majority of which were at least tethered ( with an unknown but much smaller component also fused ) , retained close to 60 % of their original Sec23 relative to a fully coated vesicle with a GMP - PNP ( 5 ’ - guanylyl imidodiphosphate ) - locked COPII coat [ 12 , 31 ] . As depicted , the tethering event involves a macromolecular Table 1 .

Suppose that the amount of coat remaining is not compatible with fusion ; then perhaps , following the initial culmina - tion of this complex , comes an uncoating event ( labeled ‘ 2 ’ ) in which the coat must be destabilized or shed to a degree necessary to expose the SNAREs , allow close membrane apposition , and provide sufficient membrane fluidity for fusion to be initiated . It makes a lot of sense to posit that the tethering complex itself , or some other focally associated component , initiates this coat depoly - merization . For the Dsl1 tethering complex , a complex web of interactions between the Dsl1 subunit and exposed ( as well as cryptic ) binding sites on the COPI coat has been proposed to initiate a focal depolymeriza - tion process [ 14 ] . For the transport protein particle ( TRAPP ) I complex involved in homotypic and hetero - typic COPII vesicle fusion , the fact that TRAPPI is a Rab1 GEF and a tether that interacts with the COPII inner layer during tethering suggests a role for Rab effectors in uncoating [ 12 ] . Multiple examples ( discussed above ) now provide evidence that coated vesicles accumulate when tethering is prevented , and yet the nature and directness of tether involvement in uncoating remain a mystery for now . Furthermore , there is no reason to assume that a focally initiated uncoating could cause depolymerization of the entire vesicle coat – most of the coat would be quite distant from the tether site . Whether or not a triggered uncoating step ( ‘ 2 ’ ) exists , trans - SNARE pairing and fusion would ensue once the tethered proximal membrane leaflets are sufficiently clear . This would potentially bring about dramatic changes , from the coat ’ s point of view , in membrane curvature , lipid composition , and the availability of cofactors potentially catalyzing coat post - translational modifications [ 28 - 30 ] . The balance of these factors would determine the degree of uncoating occurring during a third , fusion - dependent phase of coat depolymerization ( ‘ 3 ’ ) . Is uncoating an all - or - nothing process ? The recent data and our speculative model of uncoating leave big holes to be dealt with in the future . For example , to what degree do the two coat layers – the inner cargo adaptor layer and the outer - shell layer – come off simultaneously as opposed to separately ? Do potential phases of uncoating ( ‘ 1 ’ , ‘ 2 ’ , or ‘ 3 ’ ) operate primarily on different layers of coat ? To date , there are not enough data on this subject , although one could naturally assume that if the layers uncoat sequentially , then the outer layer should depolymerize first , with the cargo - bound inner layer lingering on the vesicle longer . This order of events has been established as the case for CCVs , for which the outer clathrin layer is removed by Figure 1 . Model of potential vesicle - uncoating steps Transport vesicle uncoating may take place in the cytosol prior to tethering ( ‘ 1 ’ ) , at the target membrane following tethering ( ‘ 2 ’ ) , following fusion ( ‘ 3 ’ ) , or a combination of these . See the ‘ When and where does uncoating take place ? ’ section of the text for a detailed explanation . Vesicle coat is represented by heavy dashed lines . A Rab protein is represented by a blue oval .

In addition , we wonder how cooperative the uncoating process is . When an uncoating factor disrupts the coat at a focal spot on the vesicle , would that destabilize the entire coat and necessitate complete depolymerization of the coat ? Finally , until proven otherwise , we should remind ourselves not to assume that uncoating goes to completion even after fusion with the target organelle . Remnants of coat could well serve the purpose of defining a domain with similar cargo remaining relatively concentrated , facilitating sorting from cargo with distinct destinations ( labeled ‘ residual coat domain ’ in the model ) . An example where such a post - fusion role for remnant coat might make sense would be the vesicular tubular cluster , which is involved in concentrating and distilling COPII - derived antero - grade cargo by eliminating most membrane through the generation of retrograde COPI vesicles . Interestingly , immuno - electron tomography revealed free , dumbbell - shaped , partially coated COPII - coated carriers – perhaps the fusion products of two COPII vesicles [ 34 ] . These dumbbells , which were abundant near ER exit sites , exhibited COPII coat on opposite ends but not at the neck region where membrane fusion may have just occurred . In another recent case , it appeared that residual clathrin present on post - Golgi carriers after fusion with the plasma membrane determined the balance between kiss - and - run and complete exocytosis [ 35 ] . Such effects on fusion pore dynamics could have important con - sequences for the mixture of materials that get secreted ( with small molecules preferentially released by kiss - and - run ) and would signify an unexpected post - fusion sorting function for residual coats .
