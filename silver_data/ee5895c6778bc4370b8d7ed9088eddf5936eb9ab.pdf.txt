INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in numerous cellular processes , including motility , cytokinesis and cell shape ( Bretscher , 1991 ; Condeelis , 1993 ) . Mammalian cells exhibit two major types of actin networks . Actin stress ﬁbers are contractile elements consisting of numerous bundled ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) ﬁlaments , which extend throughout the cell and terminate at sites of cell - substratum contacts termed focal adhesions . Cells also contain a cortical cytoskeletal network rich in highly crosslinked F - actin that is indirectly attached to the overlying plasma membrane ( Bretscher , 1991 ; Stossel , 1993 ) . Direct morphological changes in plasma membrane topology are produced by polymerization and rearrangement of underlying cortical actin ﬁlaments initiated through a variety of signal transduction pathways ( Stossel , 1993 ; Gips , 1994 ) . One of the most prominent responses is the formation of membrane ruffles , which is prerequisite for directed cell locomotion ( Ridley , 1994 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ) . The small GTPases of the Rho family have been implicated in the control of both cell motility and morphology through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Zigmond , 1996 ; Tapon and Hall , 1997 ; Hall , 1998 ) . In serum - starved Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , introduction of activated ( GTP - bound ) RhoA leads to the formation of stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) , whereas activated Rac1 causes the formation of membrane ruffles and smaller focal complexes around the periphery of the cell ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Activation of a third family member , Cdc42 , promotes the production of ﬁner , hair - like projections rich in bundled actin ﬁlaments , termed ﬁlopodia ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . These speciﬁc cytoskeletal changes can be elicited by treatment of cells with extracellular agonists that lead to the activation of individual Rho family members . For instance , treatment of cells with lysophosphatidic acid or sphingosine - 1 - phosphate leads to the formation of extensive stress ﬁber and focal adhesion networks that can be effectively inhibited by prior injection of cells with C3 transferase , which inactivates Rho by ADP ribosylation ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Nobes et al . , 1995 ; Postma , 1996 ) . Cells treated with either insulin , EGF , PDGF or PMA exhibit extensive membrane ruffling due to activation of Rac1 ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Nobes et al . , 1995 ) , whereas treatment of cells with bradykinin leads to Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia formation ( Kozma et al . , 1995 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . Microinjection with activated and dominant negative Rho family members have led to the deﬁnition of a hierarchy of GTPase activation , where activation of Cdc42 leads to rapid activation of Rac1 , which in turn activates RhoA ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . These results have established the Rho family of GTPases as direct regulators of the actin cytoskeleton in response to physiological signaling events . In addition to regulating the actin cytoskelton , Rho family GTPases have been implicated in a number of diverse cellular 2433 Journal of Cell Science 111 , 2433 - 2443 ( 1998 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1998 JCS4584 Small GTPases of the Rho family regulate signaling pathways that control actin cytoskeletal structures . In Swiss 3T3 cells , RhoA activation leads to stress ﬁber and focal adhesion formation , Rac1 to lamellipoda and membrane ruffles , and Cdc42 to microspikes and ﬁlopodia . Several downstream molecules mediating these effects have been recently identiﬁed . In this report we provide evidence that the intracellular localization of the actin binding protein cortactin , a Src kinase substrate , is regulated by the activation of Rac1 . Cortactin redistributes from the cytoplasm into membrane ruffles as a result of growth factor - induced Rac1 activation , and this translocation is blocked by expression of dominant negative Rac1N17 . Expression of constitutively active Rac1L61 evoked the translocation of cortactin from cytoplasmic pools into peripheral membrane ruffles . Expression of mutant forms of the serine / threonine kinase PAK1 , a downstream effector of Rac1 and Cdc42 recently demonstrated to trigger cortical actin polymerization and membrane ruffling , also led to the translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex , although this was effectively blocked by coexpression of Rac1N17 . Collectively these data provide evidence for cortactin as a putative target of Rac1 - induced signal transduction events involved in membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation . Key words : Actin , Rac , Cortactin , PAK , Membrane ruffling SUMMARY Translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery is mediated by the small GTPase Rac1 Scott A . Weed , Yunrui Du and J .

For example , activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 has been shown to be essential for progression into the G 1 phase of the cell cycle ( Olson et al . , 1995 ) by complexing with and activating the 70 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase ( Chou and Blenis , 1996 ) . Rac1 activation is essential for Ras transformation and metastatic invasiveness in a variety of cell lines ( Qui et al . , 1995 ; Keely et al . , 1997 ) supporting its role in cellular growth processes . Furthermore , both Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate the c - Jun N - terminal or stress - activated MAP kinase ( JNK / SAPK ) as well as the p38 MAP kinase cascades ( Coso et al . , 1995 ; Minden et al . , 1995 ) . Thus Rho family GTPases are molecules which control multiple divergent signal transduction pathways . Several candidate effector molecules directly interacting with activated Rho family members have been identiﬁed in an effort to elucidate the speciﬁc molecular mechanisms these GTPases use in actin remodeling ( reviewed in Tapon and Hall , 1997 ; Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey , 1997 ) . In the case of Rac1 , these include a component of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex p67 phox ( Diekmann et al . , 1994 ) , the rasGAP homologues IQGAP1 and 2 ( Brill et al . , 1996 ; Hart et al . , 1996 ) , mixed lineage kinases ( MLK ) 2 / 3 ( Burbelo et al . , 1995 ) , the Rho binding kinase p160 ROCK ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) , and a novel 34 kDa protein termed POR - 1 ( partner of rac - 1 ) ( Van Aelst et al . , 1996 ) . Perhaps the best - characterized Rac1 targets to date are members of the 62 - 65 kDa family of serine / threonine kinases termed PAKs ( Sells and Chernoff , 1997 ) . PAK kinases bind both activated Rac1 and Cdc42 with high affinity , which in turn triggers PAK autocatyltic activity ( Manser et al . , 1994 ) . PAKs are reported to mediate the Cdc42 and Rac1 - induced activation of the JNK / SAPK and p38 MAP kinase cascades ( Zhang et al . , 1995 ; Bagrodia et al . , 1995 ) . By the use of point mutations within the Rac1 effector domain , the ability of Rac1 to activate PAK and subsequent MAP kinase cascades has been functionally separated from the ability of Rac1 to induce membrane ruffling ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ; Joneson et al . , 1996 ; Westwick et al . , 1997 ) , leading to the conclusion that PAK did not play a role in Rac - induced cytoskeletal changes . Conversely , other groups have recently shown that PAK1 localizes to sites of peripheral membrane ruffling in cells stimulated with growth factors and , surprisingly , mutants of PAK1 that have lost the ability to interact with Cdc42 or Rac1 are capable of inducing cortical actin polymerization and membrane ruffles ( Sells et al . , 1997 ; Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ) . The reasons for these discrepancies are currently unknown . Our laboratory has previously identiﬁed a cytoskeletal - associated tyrosine kinase substrate , termed cortactin , which binds F - actin with high affinity ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Originally identiﬁed as a substrate for oncogenic v - Src in transformed chicken ﬁbroblasts ( Kanner et al . , 1990 ) , cortactin contains a multidomain structure consisting of six complete and one incomplete copies of a 37 - amino - acid tandem repeat in the amino terminus followed by an alpha helical region and a region rich in proline , serine , threonine and tyrosine residues . The extreme carboxyl terminus contains a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( Wu et al . , 1991 ; Miglarese et al . , 1994 ) . The F - actin binding site has been shown to lie within the tandem repeat region ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Cortactin is a nearly ubiquitous protein , being absent only in erythrocytes and lymphocytic cells , where it is replaced by a homologous protein termed HS1 ( Kitamura et al . , 1989 ) , which has been shown to be an important component in ZAP70 and Syk kinase signaling pathways ( Taniuchi et al . , 1995 ; Ruzzene et al . , 1996 ) . In non - transformed cells cortactin is highly enriched at the cell periphery , within membrane ruffles and lamellipodia of several different cell types ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Transformation of cells with oncogenic Src variants leads to the redistribution of cortactin into cell - substratum contact sites termed podosomes ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . A similar redistribution of cortactin within podosomes is seen in human squamous carcinoma cells overexpressing cortactin ( Schurring et al . , 1993 ) , which correlates with an increase in serine / threonine phosphorylation ( van Damme et al . , 1997 ) . Although the functional signiﬁcance of cortactin redistribution is currently unknown , it is apparent that the subcellular localization of cortactin is tightly controlled in both normal and transformed cell types by speciﬁc cell signaling events . Here we report that the localization of cortactin to membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in non - transformed cells is controlled by Rac1 . Cortactin redistributes from the cytoplasm to the cell periphery within membrane ruffles and colocalizes with F - actin in response to Rac1 activating agonists . Translocation of cortactin is inhibited in cells overexpressing dominant negative Rac1N17 , and is stimulated in cells overexpressing constitutive active Rac1L61 . Mutant forms of PAK1 previously demonstrated to trigger membrane ruffling also led to peripherial cortactin translocation , which was effectively blocked by the presence of Rac1N17 . We conclude that cortactin is a potential mediator of Rac1 - induced membrane ruffling , where it may be involved in transducing signals involved in actin - based cortical cytoskeletal rearrangements . MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA constructs The CMV - driven eukaryotic expression vector pRK5 - myc ( Olson et al . , 1996 ) , pRK5 - myc constructs containing dominant negative Rac1N17 , constitutive active Rac1L61 , effector loop mutants Rac1L61A37 , Rac1L61C40 and constitutive active RhoAL63 were kindly provided by A . Hall ( University College , London , UK ) and have been previously described ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) . Wild - type PAK1 , kinase - activated PAK1 423E , GTPase - binding negative PAK1 83 , 86LL and NCK / GTPase - binding negative PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL in the vector pCMV6 ( Sells et al . , 1996 ) were kindly provided by J . Chernoff ( Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia , PA ) . All pCMV6M PAK1 constructs were digested with Bam HI and Eco RI and the PAK1 cDNAs subcloned into Eco / Bam - digested pRK5 - myc . For production of cortactin - GST fusion proteins , an amino - terminal murine cortactin fragment encompassing codons 2 - 335 ( GST - SR1 ) was ampliﬁed using the primer pair 134 ( 5 ¢ - TCCCCCGGGGAAAGCCTCTG - CAGGCCAT - 3 ¢ ) and 1135 ( 5 ¢ - CCGGAATTCTGATAGGCAGA - TGGCAC - 3 ¢ ) . The resulting fragment was digested with Sma I and Eco RI and subcloned into the yeast vector pPC97 ( Clonetech , Palo Alto , CA ) . The resultant construct was digested with Sal I and Not I and subcloned into pGex 4T - 2 ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . A carboxyl - terminal GST fusion construct ( GST - cte ; codons 329 - 546 ) was produced by PCR ampliﬁcation using primer pair 1113 ( 5 ¢ - CGCGGATCCAGGTGCCATCTGCCTAT - 3 ¢ ) and 1843 ( 5 ¢ - CGCGGATCCAACTCAAACACACGCAG - 3 ¢ ) , the resulting fragment digested with Bam HI and subcloned into Bgl II - digested pPC97 . This construct was then digested with Sal I and Not I and S . A . Weed , Y . Du and J . T . Parsons 2435 Rac activation and cortactin translocation subcloned into pGex4T2 . The validity of all PCR - generated constructs was conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing . Cell culture , microinjection and transfection Swiss 3T3 and 10T1 / 2 cells ( ATCC , Rockville , MD ) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Summit Biotechnology , Fort Collins , CO ) , 50 units / ml penicillin and 50 m g / ml streptomycin ( Gibco / BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Conﬂuent and subconﬂuent serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as described ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) . Membrane ruffling was induced by the addition of platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( 5 ng / ml ; Amersham Life Science , Arlington Heights , IL ) or phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) ( 100 nM , Sigma Chemical , St Louis , MO ) for 10 minutes . Eukaryotic expression constructs were microinjected into the nuclei of serum - starved subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells ( typically 40 - 60 cells ) at a concentration of 200 ng / ml over a period of 15 minutes , then returned to an incubator for 2 - 3 hours before analysis . In some cases microinjected cells were treated with growth factor as described above . Over 80 % of microinjected cells expressing DNA constructs as determined by anti - myc immunostaining gave the indicated response . For transfection experiments , 10T1 / 2 ﬁbroblasts were seeded onto 100 mm 2 tissue culture dishes and grown overnight to approx . 70 % conﬂuency . Cells were transfected with either pRK5 - myc Rac1N17 or empty vector and pRK5 - myc PAK1 83 , 86LL , PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL or empty vector at a 4 : 1 ratio ( w : w ) using Superfect ™ ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Following transfection for 18 hours cells were trypsinized and replated on ﬁbronectin - coated glass coverslips ( 40 m g / ml ) and allowed to spread for 90 minutes before being ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Antibodies Polyclonal antisera reactive against cortactin were produced using a chicken cortactin fusion protein induced from the pGex construct GST . p80 and puriﬁed as described ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Antibodies reactive against either the amino or carboxyl terminus of murine cortactin were obtained by passage of the antisera over a cyanogen bromide Sepharose 4B ( Pharmacia ) column coupled with either GST - SR1 or GST - cte . Antibodies were removed from the columns by acid elution ( Lombardo et al . , 1992 ) to produce anti - Nterm and anti - Cterm polyclonal antibodies . The cross - reactive anti - cortactin mAb 4F11 has been previously described ( Kanner et al . , 1990 ; Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . The 9E10 monoclonal antibody against the cMyc epitope and polyclonal anti - PAK1 ( C - 19 ) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . Goat anti - mouse and anti - rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC and Texas Red were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch ( West Grove , PA ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Following transfection , growth factor treatment and / or microinjection , cells were rinsed twice in PBS then ﬁxed for 15 minutes in a fresh solution of 4 % paraformaldehyde / PBS . After ﬁxation , cells were rinsed three times with PBS before being permeabilized for 4 minutes with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / PBS . After rinsing three times with PBS , cells were blocked for non - speciﬁc secondary antibody reactivity with a solution of 20 % goat serum ( Gibco ) / 2 % BSA in PBS for 30 minutes . Cells were then labeled with either 4F11 , or with a combination of anti - Nterm and anti - Cterm polyclonal antibodies ( all at 1 m g / ml ) for detection of endogenous cortactin ; microinjected cells expressing myc - tagged recombinant proteins were detected by double labeling with 9E10 ( 1 : 500 ) . In transfected cells coexpressing both myc Rac1N17 and myc PAK1 mutants , PAK1 was detected with polyclonal anti - PAK C - 19 ( 1 : 500 ) . All primary antibodies were diluted in 10 % goat serum / 1 % BSA / PBS and cells were labeled for 1 hour at room temperature , after which the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody ( 1 m g / ml ) in 0 . 5 % BSA / PBS . F - actin was detected with Texas Red - conjugated phalloidin ( 0 . 2 units / ml ) incubated with secondary antibody . After 45 minutes , the cells were rinsed three times with PBS , twice with distilled water and coverslips mounted onto glass slides with Vectasheild ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA ) and sealed with Cytoseal ( Stephens Scientiﬁc , Riverdale , NJ ) . Cells were viewed under a Leitz DMR ﬂuorescence microscope and images were captured with a cooled CCD camera controlled by a UNIX platform with the software program ISEE ( Inovision , Durham , NC ) . Images were further processed on a Macintosh computer with Adobe Photoshop . RESULTS Cortactin colocalizes with F - actin in growth factor - induced membrane ruffles In order to deﬁne signal transduction pathways involved in mediating the localization of cortactin to the cell cortex , we examined the distribution of cortactin in murine Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , a cell line well established as a model system for the study of cortical actin polymerization dynamics ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Mackay et al . , 1997 ) . Previous observations demonstrating the presence of cortactin within membrane ruffles of several different cell types ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) indicated that the localization of cortactin at the plasma membrane might be controlled by the small GTPase Rac1 . To examine the effects of growth factor - induced membrane ruffling on the subcellular distribution of cortactin , conﬂuent , quiescent Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were serum - starved and costained for cortactin and F - actin ( Fig . 1B , C ) . As previously described ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Nobes et al . , 1995 ) , serum - starved cells were largely devoid of stress ﬁbers and displayed a ﬁne line of F - actin around the circumference of the cell ( Fig . 2C ) . In these cells cortactin was totally absent from the cell cortex , being distributed as punctate dots scattered throughout the cytosol ( Fig . 2B ) . Induction of membrane ruffling with either PDGF ( 5 ng / ml ) or PMA ( 100 nM ) caused an increase in polymerized actin localized in plasma membrane edge - ruffles ( Fig . 2E , G ) . Membrane ruffling in response to these growth factors led to the near complete translocation of cortactin from the cytoplasm and into the ruffled membrane , where it was concentrated at the outermost edge of the ruffles ( Fig . 2D , F ) . These results indicated that treatment with factors that activate Rac1 was sufficient to translocate cortactin into lamellipodia and membrane ruffles and established cortactin as an accurate marker for membrane ruffling . Rac1 activation is required for translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery In order to directly examine the role of Rac1 involvement on cortactin translocation , subconﬂuent serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with myc - tagged Rac1 constructs ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) . Swiss cells were initially microinjected with pRK5 - myc Rac1N17 , which encodes a dominant negative mutant with a preferential affinity for GDP previously demonstrated to inhibit growth factor - mediated membrane ruffling ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Microinjected cells were detected with the anti - myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and costained with a polyclonal antibody against cortactin . In subconﬂuent serum - starved Swiss cells , cortactin localized primarily in the cytoplasm with little staining at the cell 2436 periphery ( Fig . 2A ) . The distribution of cortactin remained unchanged in cells overexpressing Rac1N17 ( Fig . 2C ) . Cortactin retained this cytoplasmic distribution in cells overexpressing Rac1N17 treated with either PDGF or PMA ( Fig . 2E , I ) . These cells also did not display a characteristic ruffled phenotype as detected in uninjected cells labeled with S . A . Weed , Y . Du and J . T . Parsons Fig . 2 . Dominant negative Rac1 blocks growth factor - induced translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery . Subconﬂuent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with the dominant negative expression construct pRK5 - myc Rac1N17 . 2 hours after microinjection cells were treated for 10 minutes with 5 ng / ml PDGF ( E - H ) or 100 nm PMA ( I - L ) . A non - injected cell ( A , B ) and a microinjected cell ( C , D ) not treated with growth factor are also shown . Following incubation and / or growth factor stimulation , cells were ﬁxed and coimmunostained for cortactin using a combination of anti - Nterm and anti - Cterm polyclonal antibodies ( A , C , E , G , I , K ) as well as for the expression of myc - tagged Rac1N17 with the monoclonal antibody 9E10 ( B , D , F , H , J , L ) .

The SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus is also indicated . Amino acid boundaries delineating major structural motifs are shown .

Bar , 50 m m . 2437 Rac activation and cortactin translocation cortactin following PDGF and PMA treatment ( Fig . 2G , K ) , indicating that membrane ruffling was also inhibited by Rac1N17 overexpression . To further verify that cortactin cortical translocation was controlled by Rac1 activity , subconﬂuent serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with pRK5 - myc Rac1L61 , which encodes a GTPase - defective mutant that leads to the abundant production of membrane ruffles and cortical actin polymerization ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . In contrast to uninjected cells ( Fig . 3A ) , the majority of the cortactin was translocated into membrane ruffles in cells overexpressing Rac1L61 ( Fig . 3E ) . The staining of cortactin was observed around the entire circumference of the cell , and appeared to precede membrane ruffling in cells expressing low levels of Rac1L61 ( Fig . 3 , compare C versus E ) . The translocation event was not due to downstream activation of RhoA by Rac1L61 , since microinjection of a constitutive active RhoA mutant ( RhoAL63 ) did not trigger translocation ( Fig . 3G ) . In order to identify the downstream nature of the Rac1 pathway that inﬂuenced cortactin translocation , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with pRK5 - myc constructs encoding either Rac1L61A37 , which stimulates G 1 cell - cycle progression and activates the serine / threonine kinase PAK1 but fails to induce membrane ruffling , or Rac1L61C40 , which induces membrane ruffling and binds to the serine / threonine kinase ROCK but fails to bind PAK1 ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) . Overexpression of Rac1L61A37 failed to generate the translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex ( Fig . 4A ) , while Fig . 3 . Activated Rac1 stimulates the translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex . Subconﬂuent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with pRK5 - myc constructs containing activated Rac1L61 ( C - F ) or RhoAL63 ( G , H ) . ( A , B ) Uninjected . 2 hours after injection cells were ﬁxed and costained with polyclonal anti - cortactin antibodies ( A , C , E , G ) and with the anti - cMyc mAb 9E10 ( B , D , F , H ) . Expression of Rac1L61 is higher in E and F than in C and D . Arrowheads indicate sites of membrane ruffling . Bar , 50 m m . Fig . 4 . Translocation of cortactin induced by activated Rac effector loop mutants . To determine which downstream Rac pathway is involved in cortactin translocation , subconﬂuent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with pRK5 - myc constructs containing the activated Rac1L61 effector loop mutants Rac1L61A37 ( A , B ) and Rac1L61C40 ( C , D ) . 2 hours after injection cells were ﬁxed and costained with polyclonal anti - cortactin antibodies ( A , C ) and with the anti - cMyc mAb 9E10 ( B , D ) . Bar , 50 m m . 2438 expression of Rac1L61C40 stimulated the near complete translocation of cortactin to the cell perimeter ( Fig . 4C ) and gave a staining pattern nearly identical to that of cells expressing low levels of Rac1L61 ( Fig . 3C ) . These data suggest that cortactin serves a role in Rac1 - induced actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and not in JNK - or p38 MAP kinase - driven cell - cycle progression meditated by PAK1 . Translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex mediated by the serine / threonine kinase PAK1 Recent reports have indicated that PAK1 can induce lamellipodia formation and actin - based membrane ruffling ( Sells et al . , 1997 ; Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ) . We sought to determine if PAK1 activation would also direct cortical cortactin localization . PAK1 cDNAs were subcloned into pRK5 - myc and microinjected into serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Overexpression of wild - type PAK1 ( PAK1 WT ) and the catalytically active PAK1 423E failed to stimulate the cortical translocation of cortactin ( Fig . 5A , C ) . Cells overexpressing PAK1 83 , 86LL , a PAK1 mutant previously shown to induce membrane ruffling ( Sells et al . , 1997 ; Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ) caused the translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery ( Fig . 5E ) . This form of PAK1 harbors two point mutations in the GTPase binding domain , which prevents direct binding of Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Sells et al . , 1997 ) . The phenotype of cells expressing PAK1 83 , 86LL varied from that of cells expressing Rac1L61 in that some areas of the cell periphery failed to contain detectable cortactin labeling ( Fig . 5E ) . The amino terminus of all known PAK kinases contains a PXXP motif , which has been shown to mediate the binding of PAK1 to the second SH3 domain of the adapter protein NCK ( Bokoch et al . , 1996 ; Galisteo et al . , 1996 ) , and this complex is required for translocation and catalytic activation of PAK1 at the plasma membrane ( Lu et al . , 1997 ) . Cortical actin rearrangements induced by PAK1 83 , 86LL are blocked by the introduction of a point mutation at position 13 , which disrupts NCK binding and membrane ruffling ( PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL ) ( Galisteo et al . , 1996 ; Sells et al . , 1997 ) . Expression of PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL in serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells also led to the translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex ( Fig . 5G ) . The pattern of cortactin immunostaining in cells expressing PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL was nearly identical to that in cells expressing PAK1 83 , 86LL ( Fig . 5E , G ) , indicating that translocation of cortactin by PAK1 83 , 86LL does not require NCK - mediated PAK1 membrane localization . In order to verify the activity of the PAK1 mutants , subconﬂuent serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with PAK1 83L , 86L or PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL and colabeled with 9E10 and Texas Red phalloidin ( Fig . 6 ) . Cells overexpressing PAK1 83 , 86LL displayed a ruffled phenotype that was not evident in cells overproducing the PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL mutant ( Sells et al . , 1997 ) . Serum - starved cells expressing PAK1 83 , 86LL displayed numerous lamellipodia and areas of cortical membrane ruffling ( Fig . 6C ) but were not ruffled to the same extent as cells stimulated with growth factors ( Fig . 1E , G ) . These lamellipodia were completely absent in cells expressing PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL ( Fig . 6E ) . Serum - starved cells expressing both PAK1 mutant forms contained abundant stress ﬁbers , indicative of endogenous RhoA activation ( Fig . 6C , E ) , as has been observed before ( Sells et al . , 1997 ) . Because serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells displayed very poor viability when comicroinjected with Rac and PAK expression constructs , 10T1 / 2 ﬁbroblasts were cotransfected with Rac1N17 and either PAK1 83 , 86LL or PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL to determine if PAK1 - induced cortactin translocation required Rac1 activity ( Fig . 7 ) . When trypsinized and plated onto ﬁbronectin in media containing 10 % serum , a signiﬁcant amount of cortactin localized at the cell periphery in 10T1 / 2 cells that had spread for 90 minutes ( Fig . 7A ) . Cortactin translocation in these cells was also dependent on Rac1 activity , since cells overexpressing Rac1N17 effectively blocked cortactin translocation ( Fig . 7C ) , while cells S . A .

To examine the involvement of PAK1 in cortactin translocation , serum - starved subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with pRK5 - myc constructs containing wild - type PAK1 ( A , B ) , kinase - activated PAK1 423E ( C , D ) , GTPase - binding defective PAK1 83 , 86LL ( E , F ) and the NCK / GTPase negative PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL ( G , H ) . 2 hours after injection cells were ﬁxed and costained with polyclonal anti - cortactin antibodies ( A , C , E , G ) and with the anti - cMyc mAb 9E10 ( B , D , F , H ) .

Cells transfected with PAK1 83 , 86LL and PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL also contained translocated cortactin ( Fig . 7G , I ) ; however , the intensity of staining indicated a discontinous distribution of cortactin at the cell periphery similar to that seen in serum - starved Swiss cells ( Fig . 5E , G ) . When coexpressed with Rac1N17 , neither PAK1 83 , 86LL nor PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL induced cortactin translocation to the cell periphery ( Fig . 7M , O ) . These results indicate that the ability of PAK1 to contribute to cortactin organization at the cell cortex is dependent on the activity of Rac1 . DISCUSSION Although cortactin has been well documented to be involved in signaling events involving tyrosine phosphorylation , the signaling pathways that lead to the subcellular localization of cortactin at the cell cortex are poorly understood . In this study we demonstrate that localization of cortactin into peripheral membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in Swiss 3T3 and 10T1 / 2 ﬁbroblasts is controlled by Rac1 activation . In serum - starved cells , stimuli that induce membrane ruffling led to the translocation of cortactin from an undeﬁned cytoplasmic compartment to the cell periphery , where it colocalized with F - actin within membrane ruffles . Treatment of cells with PMA and PDGF , which activate Rac1 through two distinct upstream signaling pathways ( Zigmond , 1997 ) induced both membrane ruffling and cortactin translocation . PDGF stimulated cortactin translocation was blocked by expression of Rac1N17 , previously demonstrated to block membrane ruffling ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Expression of a constitutive active Rac1 variant ( Rac1L61 ) led to cortactin translocation , as did an effector loop Rac1 mutant ( Rac1L61C40 ) , previously demonstrated to stimulate membrane ruffling but not PAK1 activation ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) . Nevertheless , overexpression of PAK1 mutants demonstrated to cause membrane ruffling also efficiently induced cortactin translocation to the cell periphery , although PAK1 - induced translocation was effectively blocked by coexpression of Rac1N17 . Thus we suggest that cortactin participates in signaling events involved in Rac1 - induced cortical actin rearrangements . The growth factor - stimulated translocation of cortactin into sites of membrane ruffling indicates that cortactin participates in physiological signaling events that are triggered by Rac1 activation . Several other proteins have recently been reported to be translocated to the plasma membrane as a consequence of Rac activation . In neutrophils , Rac - induced translocation of p67 phox to the plasma membrane has been shown to be critical Fig . 6 . Differential effects of PAK1 mutants on the actin cytoskeleton . Serum - starved subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with pRK5 - myc PAK1 83 , 86LL ( C , D ) and with pRK5 - myc PAK1 13A , 83 , 38LL ( E , F ) . ( A , B ) ; uninjected .

PDGF treatment of NIH 3T3 cells leads to targeting of c - Src to the peripheral membrane , presumably through activation of Rac1 ( Fincham et al . , 1996 ) . A recent report demonstrating cortactin regulation of F - actin bundling by c - Src phosphorylation in vitro ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) would provide a mechanism by which Rac1 activation would lead to the compartmentalization of c - Src and cortactin to regulate F - actin dynamics within membrane ruffles . Although cortactin has been shown to be a substrate for c - Src in murine ﬁbroblasts treated with FGF ( Zhan et al . , 1993 ) and EGF ( Maa et al . , 1992 ) , we have been unable to detect changes in the level of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation or enrichment of c - Src in membrane ruffles serum - starved quiescent Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts treated with PDGF for 10 minutes ( S . A . Weed and J . T . Parsons , unpublished observations ) . Whether these discrepancies are growth factor - and / or cell type - speciﬁc remains to be determined . Overexpression of constitutive active Rac1L61 leads to the translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery and into membrane ruffles in a manner similar to growth factor - induced cortactin translocation , indicating the dependence on Rac1 activity of cortical cortactin translocation . We have not detected a direct interaction between Rac1 and cortactin ( not shown ) , and thus we presume that cortactin translocation is triggered by the activation of one ( or more ) molecules whose activity is initiated by complexing with activated Rac1 . Expression of the activated effector loop mutant Rac1L61C40 resulted in the translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery while expression of the Rac1L61A37 mutant did not . Prior studies have shown that Rac1L61C40 retains the ability to bind to the RhoA - activated kinase p160 ROCK and POR1 ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ; Joneson et al . , 1996 ; Westwick et al . , 1997 ) . These data would suggest that cortactin participates in p160 ROCK and / or POR1 signaling events initiated by Rac1 activation . While the binding of Rac1L61 to p160 ROCK was initially identiﬁed using yeast two - hybrid analysis ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) , it is not clear if this enzyme is an in vivo target for Rac1 . S . A . Weed , Y . Du and J . T . Parsons Fig . 7 . Dominant negative Rac1 inhibits PAK1 - induced cortactin translocation . 10T1 / 2 ﬁbroblasts were transfected with pRK5 - myc ( A , B , K , L ) , pRK5 - myc Rac1N17 ( C , D ) , pRK5 - myc Rac1L61 ( E , F ) , pRK5 - myc PAK1 83 , 86LL ( G , H ) , pRK5 - myc PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL ( I , J ) or cotransfected with pRK5 - myc Rac1 N17 and PAK1 83 , 86LL ( M , N ) or pRK5 - myc Rac1 N17 and PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL ( O , P ) . 18 hours after transfection cells were resuspended by trypsinization and replated onto ﬁbronectin - coated coverslips in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and allowed to spread for 90 minutes before ﬁxation . Cells were double - labeled with either polyclonal anti - cortactin antibodies ( A , C , E , G , I ) and the anti - cMyc mAb 9E10 ( B , D , F , H , J ) or with the monoclonal anti - cortactin antibody 4F11 ( K , M , O ) and anti - PAK polyclonal antibody ( L , N , P ) . Bar , 50 m m . 2441 Rac activation and cortactin translocation It appears more likely that p160 ROCK acts as a downstream effector for RhoA , since it binds to RhoA with a much higher affinity than to Rac1 ( Ishizaki et al . , 1996 ) and overexpression of the closely related isoform Rho kinase leads to the formation of Rho - dependent stress ﬁbers and focal adhesion formation ( Amano et al . , 1997 ) , and not membrane ruffles . Thus , a possible candidate for participating in Rac1 - induced cortactin signaling events may be POR1 , which localizes to membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in cells overexpressing activated Rac1 ( Van Aelst et al . , 1996 ) . While the ability of Rac1L61C40 to promote cortactin translocation seemed to exclude the role of PAK kinases as mediators of Rac1 - induced cortactin translocation , our studies with PAK1 mutants demonstrate that forms of PAK1 effective in inducing membrane ruffling can stimulate cortactin translocation to the cell cortex . Both PAK1 mutants 83 , 86LL and 13A , 83 , 86LL failed to bind Cdc42 or Rac1 , but effectively translocated cortactin to cortical regions , although the distribution of cortactin was discontinuous around the perimeter of the cell ( Fig . 5 ) . PAK1 83 , 86LL has been previously reported to initiate actin polymerization and membrane ruffling in Swiss 3T3 and other cell types in the presence of dominant negative Rac1N17 , indicating that the ruffling response was not due to a feedback loop that activated endogenous Rac1 ( Sells et al . , 1997 ) . However , our studies indicate that the ability of both this mutant and of PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL to translocate cortactin is completely inhibited in the presence of Rac1N17 ( Fig . 7 ) . While it is conceivable that these PAK1 mutants utilize divergent pathways for cortactin translocation and membrane ruffling , a more plausable explaination may involve the participation of a member of the recently identiﬁed PAK - associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) termed PIX ( PAK - interacting exchange protein ) ( Manser et al . , 1998 ) . PIX proteins are tightly associated with PAK and act as GEFs for Rac1 in vivo , as indicated by the ability of overexpressed PIX to induce membrane ruffling in Hela cells ( Manser et al . , 1998 ) . PIX - induced membrane ruffling is also blocked by Rac1N17 ; therefore PAK1 may be viewed as acting upstream of Rac1 by participating in the regulation of PIX activity , which in turn increases Rac1 activity as has been previously suggested ( Manser et al . , 1998 ) . Such an explanation would account for the ability of Rac1N17 to block PAK1 83 , 86LL and PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL - induced cortactin translocation . PAK1 83 , 86LL mutants have been suggested to exist in a more ‘open’ conformation , allowing the binding of SH3 - containing proteins to occur through numerous PXXP motifs found within the PAK amino terminus ( Sells et al . , 1997 ) . The binding of the adaptor protein NCK to PAK1 has been shown to occur through a PXXP motif found at the extreme amino terminus of PAK1 ( Bokoch et al . , 1996 ; Galisteo et al . , 1996 ) , which is required for PAK1 translocation and activation ( Lu et al . , 1997 ) as well as for PAK1 83 , 86LL - induced ruffling ( Fig . 6 ; Sells et al . , 1997 ) . While the PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL mutant lacks the ability to induce membrane ruffling it is capable of inducing cortactin translocation inhibitable by Rac1N17 ( Fig . 7O ) . PIX proteins contain an SH3 domain that mediates the binding to PAK1 at a site distal to that of NCK ( residues 186 - 203 ; Manser et al . , 1998 ) , therefore they are capable of binding PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL . The overabundance of this open form of PAK1 within the cell therefore may somehow serve to stimulate endogenous PIX activity , which in turn would lead to Rac1 activation and cortactin translocation . The abundance of actin stress ﬁbers in cells overexpressing PAK1 13A , 83 , 86LL ( Fig . 6E ) is indicative of Rac1 - induced RhoA activation and not PAK activation , since PAK activity has been demonstrated to downregulate focal adhesion and stress ﬁber formation ( Manser et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , our data support a model in which translocation of cortactin to cortical sites of actin polymerization occurs by activation of Rac1 through a Rac1 / PAK / PIX complex . Activation of Rac1 subsequently allows for either the activation of a positive regulator or sequestration of a negative regulator of cortactin , thus enabling cortactin to translocate to the cell cortex . It is of interest to note that a tyrosine - phosphorylated protein of approximately 90 kDa has been reported to bind PAK1 and be a component of the PAK / PIX signaling complex ( Galisteo et al . 1996 ; Manser et al . , 1998 ) . The molecular weight of cortactin very similar ( 80 / 85 kDa ) and we are currently examining if cortactin is part of this complex . In summary , the translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex and into membrane ruffles is controlled by Rac1 activity , implying that cortactin functions in events occurring as a consequence of membrane ruffling . Membrane ruffles contain several proteins which bind and / or crosslink F - actin , and it is postulated that their activity is required for the overall organization and regulation of F - actin dynamics within the ruffle ( Condeelis , 1993 ; Ridley , 1994 ) . Membrane ruffling is required for cell locomotion ( Stossel , 1993 ) and pinocytosis ( Ridley , 1994 ) , and both events require Rac1 activity ( Keely et al . , 1997 ; Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . In addition , Rac1 activation has been reported to be involved in both receptor mediated endocytosis ( Lamaze et al . , 1996 ) as well as regulated exocytosis in certain cell types ( Norman et al . , 1996 ; Kowluru et al . , 1997 ) . A recent model has been proposed describing cell migration as largely independent of F - actin dynamics and primarily based on regulated exocytic membrane ﬂow into the leading edge of motile cells in order to drive motility ( Bretscher , 1996a , b ) . The punctate localization of cortactin within the cytoplasm , along with the striking localization at the leading edge ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , could suggest the participation of cortactin in such a process . Recently , a novel endocytic recycling pathway has been described that is controlled by the small GTPase ARF6 ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson , 1997 ) . Activation of overexpressed ARF6 by treatment of cells with aluminum ﬂuoride stimulates the translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery as well as the formation of actin - rich lamellae that are distinct from Rac1 - induced lamellipodia ( Radhakrishna et al . , 1996 ) . ARF6 also binds POR1 , which acts as a point of divergence for ARF6 - and Rac1 - induced cortical cytoskeletal reorganization ( D’Souza - Schorey et al . , 1997 ) . Given that POR1 and cortactin both reside within the same Rac1 pathway , as determined by Rac1 effector - loop mutant analysis ( Fig . 4 ) , these data suggest that cortactin may play an important role in signaling events at the lamellipodium involving actin dynamics , membrane recycling and cell migration .
