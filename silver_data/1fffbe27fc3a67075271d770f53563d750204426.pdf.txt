L E T T E R S Actin dynamics counteract membrane tension during clathrin - mediated endocytosis Steeve Boulant 1 , 2 , 4 , Comert Kural 1 , 2 , 4 , Jean - Christophe Zeeh 1 , 2 , Florent Ubelmann 3 and Tomas Kirchhausen 1 , 2 , 5 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is independent of actin dynamics in many circumstances but requires actin polymerization in others . We show that membrane tension determines the actin dependence of clathrin - coat assembly . As found previously , clathrin assembly supports formation of mature coated pits in the absence of actin polymerization on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of non - polarized mammalian cells , and also on basolateral surfaces of polarized cells . Actin engagement is necessary , however , to complete membrane deformation into a coated pit on apical surfaces of polarized cells and , more generally , on the surface of any cell in which the plasma membrane is under tension from osmotic swelling or mechanical stretching . We use these observations to alter actin dependence experimentally and show that resistance of the membrane to propagation of the clathrin lattice determines the distinction between ‘actin dependent and ‘actin independent’ . We also ﬁnd that light - chain - bound Hip1R mediates actin engagement . These data thus provide a unifying explanation for the role of actin dynamics in coated - pit budding . The coordinated action of a large number of structural and regulatory proteins and lipids is required for the assembly – disassembly of a clathrin - coated vesicle . Budding coated pits and other clathrin - coated structures can be followed in living cells by labelling component proteins with fluorescent markers 1 – 7 . Recent live - cell imaging studies reveal unexpected modes of endocytic coat assembly , with distinct kinetics , recruitment of associated proteins , requirements for the participation of actin and its accessory proteins , and mechanisms of membrane deformation 7 – 13 . Electron microscopy of B - lymphoblastoid cells showed association of actin microfilaments with clathrin - coated structures 14 , indicating that actin may participate in coated - vesicle assembly by pulling the membrane inward . In cultured mammalian cells , actin polymerization is usually dispensable for coated - pit formation 7 , 15 , but in some 1 Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , USA . 2 Immune Disease Institute and Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Children’s Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , USA . 3 Laboratoire de Morphogénèse et Signalisation Cellulaires , Institut Curie Paris , Paris , Cedex 05 , France . 4 These authors contributed equally to this work . 5 Correspondence should be addressed to T .

One such actin - dependent structure , termed a coated plaque , assembles at adherent surfaces of cultured mammalian cells 11 , 20 . Actin dynamics are essential for membrane invagination and scission associated with coated - plaque uptake . Actin dynamics also rescue the clathrin - mediated uptake of elongated ( 180nm ) vesicular stomatitis virus particles 6 ( VSV ) , which block closure of the curved pit , causing endocytosis to stall . Coordinated actin polymerization and inward movement of the partially clathrin - coated virus narrows the neck between the pit and the plasma membrane , leading to dynamin - induced scission . Thus , actin assembly is a pathway required under stringent conditions , rather than an essential process under more permissive ones 10 . In contrast , clathrin - mediated internalization is constitutively actin dependent in yeast cells 9 where actin dynamics are needed to counteract the inhibition of endocytosis induced by elevated membrane tension 21 . Inhibition of actin dynamics blocks endocytosis from the apical but not the basolateral surface of polarized cells 22 – 29 . We sought an explanation for this difference by combining live - cell , spinning - disc confocal imaging with electron microscopy . We show in polarized MDCK cells , that pharmacologically inhibiting actin dynamics or disrupting the link between actin and clathrin ( by blocking the interactionbetweenclathrinandHip1R , Huntingtininteractingprotein 1 related ; refs 11 , 30 ) selectively traps apical clathrin - coated pits at a late stage of assembly . More generally , if we raise membrane tension and inhibit actin dynamics , coated pits stall at a late stage of assembly in BSC1 or MDCK cells . Local actin dynamics seem to prevent stalling by imparting additional constriction force . We compared the dynamics of endocytic clathrin adaptor protein 2 ( AP - 2 ) - coated structures at the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized MDCK cells 1 ( Fig . 1a ) .

Their mean lifetime was 39 ± 13s ( Fig . 1d ) . The mean lifetime of clathrin - coated pits on the apical surface of the same polarized MDCK cells was significantly longer ( 55 ± 18s ; P < 0 . 001 ; NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 1125 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . L E T T E R S Fig . 1d and Supplementary Movie S1 ) , although both had a similar maximum fluorescence intensity ( Fig . 1c , e ) and hence reached a similar final size 1 , 11 . Disturbance of actin assembly in polarized MDCK cells with latrunculin or jaskplakinolide resulted in a marked increase in the lifetime of apical pits . About 90 % of the pits arrested and remained for at least 10min ( the upper limit of the time series ) , and the remaining ∼ 10 % had lifetimes significantly longer than at the apicalsurfaceinnon - treatedcells ( Fig . 1fandSupplementaryMovieS2 ) and transferrin endocytosis ceased 22 , 23 , 25 ( Supplementary Figs S1a , b ) . In contrast , basolateral pits from the same cells were unaffected by jaskplakinolide and showed a small increase in lifetime ( from 37s to 59s ) and in the fraction of arrested pits ( from 0 % to 4 % ) in response to latrunculin ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Movie S2 ) . The dependence on actin dynamics required cell polarization . Incubation with jaskplakinolide did not affect the formation and lifetime of dorsal pits in non - polarized MDCK cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . We ruled out the possibility that cessation of coat growth at the apical surface resulted from depletion of free cytosolic coat components by transiently exposing the cells to 1 - butanol , which induces coat disassembly 7 . Incubation of jasplakinolide - treated polarized MDCK cells for 3min with 1 - butanol led to rapid disappearance ( ∼ 10s ) of all AP - 2 spots ( Supplementary Fig . S3a , 1 - butanol ) . Removal of the 1 - butanol with jasplakinolide still present led to synchronous appearance of newly formed apical coated pits that again stalled at late assembly ( Supplementary Fig . S3a , b ) . The fluorescence intensity of the long - lived apical pits in jaskplakinolide - treated cells was on average 10 % lessthanthemaximumintensityinuntreatedcells ( Supplementary Fig . S3b ) . As fluorescence intensity is proportional to coat size 11 , this indicates that the long - lived pits may arrest at a late stage of coat assembly , but before full completion . Electron microscopy of MDCK cells treated with jasplakinolide or latrunculin showed a substantial increase ( from 10 to ∼ 70 % ) in the fraction of coated pits at the apical surface linked to the plasma membrane by wide necks ( U - shaped ) , representing incomplete coats arrested at a relatively late stage of assembly ( Fig . 1g , h ) . Narrower necks were less common , and we saw no long tubules decorated at their end by clathrin coats . Untreated control cells showed the expected distribution of coated profiles ( Fig . 1g , h ) . Jaskplakinolide or latrunculin did not affect the distribution of basolateral coated profiles ( Fig . 1h ) . Dynamin associates with the neck of a fully formed coated pit and promotes release of a coated vesicle 1 , 4 , 31 . Dynamin does not associate with the wide neck of incomplete pits , and indeed very few ( ∼ 5 % ) of the long - lived apical pits generated by jasplakinolide treatment recruited a detectable amount of dynamin - 2 ( Supplementary Fig . S4a , b ) . The apical pits of untreated cells recruited dynamin normally ( ∼ 30 % of pits co - localize with the relatively strong dynamin signal ; Supplementary Fig . S4b ) . We conclude that clathrin - coated pits assembling on the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells require actin dynamics for closure but not for initiation , whereascoatassemblyonthebasolateralsurfaceisactinindependent . We next examined the differential effects at the two surfaces of inhibiting the small GTPases Cdc42 , Rac1 and Arf6 ( regulators of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization 26 , 32 ) and of blocking clathrin binding of Hip1R . Cdc42 inhibition did not arrest pit formation , had only a small effect on the formation and lifetime of apical or basolateral pits ( Fig . 2a ) and had no evident influence on the distribution of apical coat morphologies ( Fig . 1h ) . Rac1 inhibition seemed to arrest apical - pit assembly , as a large fraction of the pits ( 60 % ) were present throughout the complete movie ; it also retarded basolateral pit assembly by about twofold , with a modest effect on completion and budding ( 15 % arrest ) . Arf6hasbeenlinkedtoclathrin - basedendocytosisinHeLacells 33 andat the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells 24 . Arf6 inhibition similarly arrested most of the apical pits ( 76 % ) , but had no detectable effect on basolateral coat dynamics . In all cases , the fluorescence intensity of the arrested coated pits was equivalent to the maximum intensity of pits imaged in untreated cells , indicating that the coats arrested at a late stageofassembly . Consistentwiththisconclusion , wefoundbyelectron microscopy an accumulation of U - shaped coats at the apical surfaces of polarized MDCK cells following SecinH3 treatment ( Fig . 1h ) . These inhibitorshadnoeffectonpitassemblyinnon - polarizedMDCKcells . Hip1R interacts with F - actin , cortactin and clathrin light chains 34 – 36 and connects the actin cytoskeleton with clathrin coats 34 . It is essential for assembly of coated plaques 11 and for endocytosis of VSV ( ref . 6 ) , but not for completion of coated pits in non - polarized cells 11 . We detected a role for Hip1R in apical - pit assembly by blocking the association of Hip1R with clathrin — either by overexpression of a dominant - negative form of clathrin light chain B ( CLCb - EED / QQN ) , whichbindstheclathrinheavychainbutdoesnotrecruitHip1R ( refs10 , 11 , 30 ) , or by depletion with short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) of both forms of the clathrin light chain . CLCb - EED / QQN overexpression in non - polarized cells does not inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis 11 , 30 ; it prevents formation of clathrin - coated plaques , but not of coated pits 11 . Overexpression in polarized MDCK cells inhibited completion of apical pits ( 60 % arrest , as defined by pits with lifetimes longer than the upper limit of the time series we recorded ) but affected basolateral pits in the same cells only modestly , increasing their lifetimes from 47s to 86s and generally permitting complete assembly ( 15 % arrest ; Fig . 2b ) . Overexpression of wild - type LCb had no detectable effect on pit dynamics 11 ( Fig . 2b ) , confirming that failure of the mutated light chain to recruit Hip1R had produced the observed late - stage arrest . siRNA - mediated knockdown of light chains led to late - stage arrest of pits at the apical but not at the basolateral surface ( Fig . 2b ) . Results from Hip1R depletion were not interpretable because of the massive upregulation of the number of actin filaments throughout the cells 17 , 35 , 37 ( SupplementaryFig . S3c ) , theincreaseinthelevelofcytosolic AP - 2 and the general arrest of coated - pit formation at the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized MDCK cells ( Supplementary Fig . S3d ) , explaining the previously observed partial inhibition of transferrin uptake 35 . Thus , under actin - independent conditions , inhibiting Hip1R recruitment has no influence on clathrin - mediated endocytosis 30 or on coat assembly 11 . When actin dynamics are required to finish coat assembly , however , blocking Hip1R recruitment has the same effect ( late - stage arrest ) as blocking actin dynamics . As for Hip1R , the light chains are dispensable for initiation and early growth of coats under all conditions examined . Apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells have large numbers of microvilli . Treatment of polarized MDCK cells with a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) probe specific for ezrin , on which microvilli depend , resulted in substantial loss of the protein and disappearance of microvilli ( Supplementary Fig . S5a ) . Following ezrin depletion , actin was no longer required for apical - pit completion ( Supple - mentary Fig . S5b ) . Moreover , overexpression of villin - 1 – Cherry in non - polarized BSC1 cells generated a large number of microvilli - like 1126 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

S5c ) and caused actin - dependent coated - pit maturation ( Supplementary Fig . S5d ) . Thus , the actin dependence of coat completion correlates with a property imparted to the plasma membrane in response to the formation of microvilli or microvillus - related structures . Membrane tension in polarized cells is greater in apical than in basolateral regions 38 . We investigated whether clathrin - coat assembly might be sufficient to deform the underlying membrane completely under conditions of low membrane tension , whereas an additional activity associated with actin dynamics might be needed under conditions of high membrane tension . Increasing membrane tension by exposing cells to hypotonic medium ( Fig . 3 ) revealed strong correlation between the severity of the hypotonic treatment and the appearance of arrested pits in non - polarized cells treated with jaskplakinolide ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Movie S3 ) and at the basolateral surface of polarized MDCK cells treated first with jasplakinolide ( not shown ) . The actin requirement induced by hypotonic treatment was reversible ( data not shown ) . Electron microscopy of jaskplakinolide - treated BSC1 cells incubated with hypotonic medium confirmed that most apical coated pits had U - shaped structures . The pits from these cells also failed to accumulate dynamin ( not shown ) . We also increased membrane tension by laterally stretching cells growing on an elastic support . Pits at the basolateral surface of control , unstretched MDCK cells had an average lifetime of 43 s that was insensitive to jasplakinolide ( Fig . 4b ) , comparable to pits in MDCK cells grown on glass coverslips ( Fig . 1d ) . Linear stretching by 25 % led to a small but statistically significant increase in pit lifetime ( from 43s to 52s ) and pit arrest ( from 4 % to 8 % ) . Jaskplakinolide treatment of the stretched cells resulted in a marked increase in pit lifetimes and percentage of arrested pits ( from 8 % to 60 % ; Fig . 4b ) . Thus , local actin dynamics must coordinate with clathrin assembly to achieve complete vesiculation following increased membrane tension .

Polarized MDCK or non - polarized BSC1 cells incubated for 10min in serially diluted medium ( from 100 % to 50 % ) of decreasing osmolarity , ranging from 311 to 174 mOsM , were analysed for the effects of altering actin dynamics on the lifetimes of their AP - 2 - coated structures .

Bottom , fraction of AP - 2 objects with longer duration than the time series . Thus , we show that interfering with actin dynamics induces arrest of canonical coated - pit assembly under some circumstances , but not under others . Indeed , actin activity is essential for efficient completion of coated pits at the apical surfaces of polarized cells in culture , but not at the basolateral surfaces of the same cells . Coat assembly in various non - polarized cells does not ordinarily depend on actin 7 , 11 , 15 . Furthermore , the actin dependence of coated - pit assembly can be modulated experimentally by modifying membrane tension : coat formation in a non - polarized cell can be rendered actin dependent by exposure to hypotonic medium , by stretching the substrate or by inducing the formation of microvillus - like structures ; coat formation at the apical surface of a polarized cell can be rendered actin independent by shrinking its apical microvilli . In addition , interfering with actin dynamics under conditions that require actin activity causes coats to stall late in assembly . Most AP - 2 complexes are recruited during earlier stages 11 , 20 , 39 . Therefore , we estimate ( from the fluorescence intensity of tagged AP - 2 and from the appearance of the U - shaped pits that accumulate ) that the stalled coats are roughly two - thirds to three - quarters complete . At this stage of completion , the ‘neck’ is probably not yet narrow enough to allow dynamin recruitment , as the dynamin burst normally associated with maturation of a coated pit into a coated vesicle was not detected . Finally , we show that perturbing actin dynamics does not directly affect coat initiation 7 . Thus , canonical coated pits differ in this respect from coated plaques , which require actin dynamics for both initiation and invagination 11 . 1128 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

We investigated what determines actin engagement if coat assembly stalls . In principle , there may be a ‘sensor’ of assembly arrest . Alternatively , actin may be engaged constitutively , but with at most a small contribution to observable coat dynamics except in circumstances of elevated membrane tension . The distinction between ‘actin dependent’ and ‘actin independent’ would then be determined by the threshold of membrane tension ( or other resistance to propagation of the coat lattice ) at which the free energy of clathrin – clathrin contacts can no longer overcome membrane resistance to generating a constricted neck . Our experiments , in which we switch from actin dependence to actin independence and vice versa , are consistent with this threshold picture . Indeed , increased tension is a common feature Plasma membrane Arf6 - and Rac1 - dependent actin polymerization facilitates constriction of the U - shaped pit Actin Actin Membrane tension Time W o r k a g a i n s t t e n s i o n W o r k a g a i n s t t e n s i o n – tension Time + tension Membrane tension a c b Hip1R attachment to F - actin ActinArf6Rac1 Cortactin , Arp2 / 3 Hip1RDynamin Figure 5 Model depicting the role of actin polymerization during the formation of endocytic clathrin - coated pits . ( a ) Under non - stringent conditions and low membrane tension , assembly of the clathrin coat is sufﬁcient to deform the membrane into a tightly constricted coated pit . ( b ) Under more stringent conditions of high membrane tension , clathrin assembly is not sufﬁcient and membrane invagination stalls ; actin polymerization then provides the additional work needed to complete membrane bending . Hip1R links the assembling clathrin coat to actin polymers , and if sufﬁcient time is allowed , then assembly of short - branched actin rescues the stalled coat . The two main forces resisting membrane deformation are bending and tension . The bending work per unit area depends inversely on the curvature and hence is uniform for a spherical or nearly spherical vesicle . The work done against a constant membrane tension depends on the net increase in membrane area—that is , the area of the invaginated membrane minus the area of the opening it covers . The plot represents the cumulative work required to counteract membrane tension , and does not include the work required to create the membrane vesicle . The cumulative work was calculated according to W = π r 2 T ( 1 − cos α ) 2 , where T is the membrane tension and α is the angle ( in radians ) between the pole of the budding pit and the position at which the curved pit intersects the plane of the plasma membrane ( see Methods ) . When the neck begins to constrict ( α = π / 2 ) , the area of the opening decreases and the net increase in area rises sharply . When the pit is complete , α = π . ( c ) Hip1R links actin ﬁlaments with the clathrin coat by interactions with F - actin and clathrin light chains . Branched actin ﬁlaments grow towards the plasma membrane through new ﬁlament assembly at the barb end of the stabilized actin ﬁlaments ; this growth relies on Arp2 / 3 stimulation , mediated by cortactin and by small GTPases such as Arf6 and Rac1 . in which actin dynamics are required for coated - pit maturation beyond the ‘U’ stage . One explanation for why coated - pit assembly may stall at this point is embodied in Fig . 5 . Under conditions of constant membrane tension , the work needed to invaginate the first hemisphere of a coated vesicle is substantially less than that needed to complete the second hemisphere ( see Methods ) . Extreme levels of tension will NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 1129 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . L E T T E R S probably block invagination altogether ; an intermediate level may stall the process when the work needed to counteract the tension is greater than incremental coat assembly can contribute . Clathrin - mediated uptake in yeast cells depends constitutively on actin dynamics . Initial steps in coat formation precede local actin assembly , which is essential for invagination and inward movement 9 . Increased turgor diminishes internalization 21 , in agreement with our observations on membrane tension in mammalian cells . Exposure to hyperosmotic medium , which reduces turgor to below - normal levels , rescues internalization of a fluid phase marker , even when actin dynamics are blocked 21 , but it is not clear whether the rescue involves a clathrin - coated structure . We have shown that actin polymerization takes over from clathrin polymerization in driving membrane invagination , when the latter processstalls . Actinisengagedatthecoatbyclathrin - light - chain - bound Hip1R . We have not determined whether actin simply pushes the plasma membrane away from the coat , or whether branching at Arp2 / 3 helps constrict the neck . Actin polymerization similarly takes over when clathrin polymerization and assembly stalls because of steric interference from cargo ( for example , VSV ; refs 6 , 10 ) , and actin alone drives the remaining membrane invagination and constriction . Coated plaques are also examples of this phenomenon , in which adhesion of cell - surface proteins to the substrate generates the steric interference .

Jasplakinolide ( Alexis Biochemical ) , latrunculin A , NSC - 23766 ( Rac1 inhibitor 40 ) , SecinH3 ( inhibitorforcytohesins 41 , smallguaninenucleotideexchange factors ( GEFs ) forArffactorsincludingArf6 ; Calbiochem ) andsecramine ( inhibitor of Cdc42 ; ref . 42 ) were used at 1 µ M , 1 µ M , 50 µ M and 1 µ M , respectively . Cellcultureandtransfections . MDCKandBSC1cellsstablyexpressing σ 2 – eGFP ( the small subunit of AP - 2 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein , eGFP ) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10 % FCS , penicillin and streptomycin . The MDCK cells expressing σ 2 – eGFP were generated by transfection with Fugen HD selected with G418 . Plasmids encoding Cherry fused to wild - type and mutant bovine clathrin light chain B ( Cherry – LCb and Cherry – LCb - EED / QQN ) were made by exchange of eGFP with Cherry from eGFP – LCb and eGFP – LCb - EED / QQN ( P . McPherson ) . Transientexpressionofvillin – Cherry , Cherry – LCband Cherry – LCb - EED / QQNwascarriedoutusingTransIT - LT1 ( MirusBioLL ) andcells were analysed 12 – 16h after transfection unless otherwise indicated . Gene silencing . Simultaneous depletion of clathrin light chains A and B was achieved in MDCK cells stably expressing σ 2 – eGFP by siRNA - mediated gene silencing as described previously 11 . Depletion of villin - 1 and ezrin was achieved by shRNA . siRNA se - quences specific for villin - 1 ( 5 (cid:48) - CCGGGCCAAGATGAAATTACAGCATCTCG - AGATGCTGTAATTTCATCTTGGCTTTTTG - 3 (cid:48) ) and ezrin genes 5 (cid:48) - CCGGCCTG - GAAATGTATGGAATCAACTCGAGTTGATTCCATACATTTCCAGGTTTTTG - 3 (cid:48) ) were incorporated into the lentivirus vector pLKO . 1 ( Addgene ) . MDCK cells ( 1 × 10 6 ) stably expressing σ 2 – eGFP were transduced with 50 – 100 µ l of thawed supernatants , and cells containing integrated viral sequences were selected by serial passage in medium containing 4 µ gml − 1 puromycin . Osmotic swelling . MDCK or BSC1 cells kept at 37 ◦ C and in the presence of humidified 5 % CO 2 were exposed for 10min to diluted medium ( 311 , 251 , 220 and 174 mOsM ) prepared by mixing 100 , 80 , 70 or 50 % of phenol red - free DMEM containing 10 % FCS serum with 0 , 20 , 30 or 50 % water containing 10 % FCS serum . Live - cell imaging time series were acquired immediately before and after the hypo - osmotic treatment . In some experiments , jasplakinolide was added after 10min of exposure to the hypotonic medium ; in other experiments , jasplakinolide was included before and during the treatment with the hypotonic medium . Both protocols elicited the same actin dependence on the dynamics of clathrin coat formation . The actin dependence imparted by osmotic swelling of cells incubated for 10min with 50 % medium was fully lost on incubation for 10min with normal medium . Controlled stretching . To form the support chamber , first a thin sheet of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ; 50 µ m in thickness ; Specialty Silicone Products ) was placed on the bottom of a 35 - mm - diameter glass Petri dish . An optically flat - ended fused silica rod ( Techspec , Edmund Optics ) was placed on top of the PDMS sheet and used to cast the lateral walls of the PDMS chamber . The chamber was made by pouring PDMS ( Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit ; Ellsworth Adhesives ) degassed for about 20min until no more bubbles formed , and then cured for 2h at 65 ◦ C . Afterextensivewasheswithwater , thePDMSsheetwascoatedovernightat4 ◦ Cwith 50 µ gml − 1 fibronectin ( dissolved in water ) and then washed once more with PBS . About 1 × 10 4 cells were plated for 16h at 37 ◦ C . The PDMS chamber with cells was attached to a 37 ◦ C pre - equilibrated stretching device equipped with a micrometre screw and then mounted on the temperature - controlled stage of the microscope . Imaging was done before and immediately after ∼ 25 % mechanical stretching along one horizontal axis . Immunofluorescence microscopy . Cells were fixed for 15min at room tempera - ture with 4 % w / v paraformaldehyde in PBS , followed by sequential incubation with primary and secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0 . 05 % w / v Triton X - 100 and 2 % FCS . Electron microscopy . Electron microscopy was carried out as described previously 10 . Live - cell spinning - disc confocal imaging . About 1 × 10 5 BSC1 cells were plated 16h before imaging on 25 - mm - diameter glass No . 1 . 5 coverslips ; a similar number of MDCK cells were plated 1 day or 3 days ( to allow for cell polarization ) before imaging . Imaging medium was phenol red - free DMEM with 10 % FCS and 20mM HEPES . For imaging , the coverslips were placed on a temperature - controlled 5 % CO 2 - humidified chamber ( 20 / 20 Technologies ) mounted on the stage of a Mariana imaging system ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) based on an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) , a CSU - X1 spinning - disc confocal unit ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation ) , a spherical - aberration - correction device ( SAC ; Infinity Photo - Optical ) and a × 63 objective lens ( Plan - Apochromat , NA 1 . 4 , Carl Zeiss ) 10 . The SAC resolved the severe spherical aberration especially noticeable on the apical surface located 8 – 10 µ m away from the coverslip using SAC values of 1 , 100 and 850 for basolateral / bottom and apical surfaces of cells on glass coverslips , and 0 for bottom ( attached ) surfaces of cells on PDMS . Two - dimensional ( 2D ) and 3D time series were obtained using Slidebook 5 ( 3I ) . Data acquisition , image processing and statistical analysis . 2D movies from the attached surfaces ( basolateral for polarized and ventral for non - polarized cells ) were obtained with 100ms exposures from a single optical plane . 3D movies from the free surface ( apical for polarized and dorsal for non - polarized ) correspond to z stacks of 3 – 5 consecutive optical planes spaced 0 . 5 µ m acquired at a frequency of 0 . 5Hz per stack and 100 ms exposure ; a 2D movie was then obtained by generating for each time point a maximum - intensity z projection . The 3D movies had a duration of 120 – 160s , sufficient to fully track the few non - arrested AP - 2 spots ; the remaining ones had lifetimes longer than 10min when stalled by the absence of actin dynamics . Time series from the bottom surface were acquired from a single optical plane because the intensity and lifetime data obtained from these 2D movieswereequivalenttodataobtainedfrom3Dmovies , thusminimizingpotential photobleaching and phototoxicity effects . AP - 2 spots were identified and tracked using a MATLAB routine ( Kural , C . , Boulant , S . & Kirchhausen , T . , manuscript in preparation ) using three sequential steps composed of 2D Gaussian and Laplacian filtering followed by a local maxima - findingalgorithm . Theintensityprofileasafunctionoftimewasusedtocharacterize the dynamics of each of the AP - 2 spots selected according to the following criteria : fluorescentobjectswerediffractionlimited ; dynamic , non - arrestedobjectsappeared and disappeared within the time window of the time series with lifetimes of at least 20s ( thus , shorter - lived objects corresponding to abortive pits were not included for analysis ) ; arrested objects were those present throughout the duration of the time series ; the fluorescent objects did not collide with each other . Statistical tests . The statistical significance for the differences between the lifetime or maximum fluorescence intensity of the data determined under specific experimental conditions was established using a two - tailed Student t - test . Estimate of the work required to deform a membrane vesicle under conditions of membrane tension . We estimate the work done against tension as the product of the tension and the net increase in membrane area required to advance the bud to the point in question . During budding of the initial hemisphere , the increase in membrane area in the pit is accompanied by a decrease in area in the plane of the cell surface . However , when the membrane starts to constrict , both areas increase together ( Fig . 5 ) . Measured membrane tensions for cells in culture are in the range 10 – 50mNm − 1 . To generate a typical coated pit , which encloses a vesicle of diameter ∼ 700Å in a shell of about 60 – 80 clathrin trimers ( ∼ 200 heavy chains ) , from a membrane under 30mNm − 1 tension , the work needed to form the first hemisphere is about 10 − 19 J or 60kJmol − 1 ( 15kcalmol − 1 ) , whereas the work needed to complete the second hemisphere is three times that value . If 100 heavy chains contribute to the lattice surrounding the initial hemisphere , the corresponding membrane deformation requires only about 0 . 6kJmol − 1 of net free energy per heavy chain beyond the free energy needed to generate a membrane - free clathrin lattice — that is , a contribution considerably less than k B T , where k B is Boltzmann’s constant and T is temperature . Note that the estimated work required to bend a membrane into a hemisphere is roughly ten times this amount , but still only the equivalent of 1 – 2 well - placed hydrogen bonds per heavy chain and therefore easily within the free energy likely to come from assembly of the clathrin lattice . If the tension rises 10 - fold ( from cytoskeletal stretching , osmotic changes and so on ) , to levels comparable to the tension of cytoskeletally constrained red blood cell membranes 38 , 43 , the work needed to overcome tension becomes comparable to the bending work . Our observations indicate that in the absence of actin dynamics this contribution is enough to stall invagination . Addition of one actin monomer to a growing filament generates a force of about 10pN ( refs 44 , 45 ) and a displacement at the tip by about 3nm , for example about 3 × 10 − 20 J or 18kJmol − 1 . Thus , the addition of about 20 actin monomers NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .
