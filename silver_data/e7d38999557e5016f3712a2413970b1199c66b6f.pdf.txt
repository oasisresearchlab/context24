CATH . a is a central nervous system ( CNS ) catecholaminergic cell line derived from a transgenic mouse carrying the SV40 T antigen oncogene under the transcriptional control of regulatory elements from the rat tyrosine hydroxylase gene ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) . CATH . a cells express several differentiated neuronal characteristics including medium and light chain neuro - filament proteins , synaptophysin , tyrosine hydroxylase , and dopamine (cid:98) - hydroxylase ; they synthesize dopamine and norepinephrine . Conversely , they do not express glial - specific fibrillary acidic protein . To establish definitively that CATH . a cells are of neuronal origin , we characterized the repertoire of volt - age - gated inward currents expressed by CATH . a cells . Such inward currents are necessary for neuronal excit - ability . We report that all CATH . a cells possess a tetro - dotoxin - sensitive sodium current ( peak amplitude (cid:52) 590 ± 319 pA ) and 68 % possess a high voltage - activated calcium current ( peak amplitude (cid:52) 175 ± 67 pA ) . Phar - macological analyses suggest that individual cells ex - press varying levels of L - and N - type calcium current , but no P - type current . In addition , in 55 % of the cells with a calcium current , about a half of this current is resistant to selective antagonists for L - and N - type cur - rents , suggesting that another calcium current exists in these CATH . a cells which is not L - , N - , or P - type . The heterogeneous pattern of current detected persisted in several CATH . a subclones , suggesting that factors other than genetic variability influence current expression . The demonstration that CATH . a cells express these currents indicates that they have excitable membrane properties characteristic of neurons . Although many pe - ripheral nervous system ( PNS ) cell lines exist , very few CNS cell lines with differentiated neuronal properties exist . Since the CATH . a cells can be grown continu - ously in large amounts , they may be useful for purifying , characterizing , and / or cloning various neuronal - specific molecules and thereby may add to our understanding of CNS catecholaminergic neurons . Key words : Catecholaminergic — Cell line — Neuro - blastoma — Voltage clamp — Sodium current — Cal - cium current Immortalized cell lines with differentiated neuronal properties offer unique advantages for studying neuronal function . They provide a homogeneous source of a single cell type which can be grown indefinitely in large quantities , allowing the characterization and purification of neuronal - specific molecules . Central nervous system ( CNS ) cell lines are especially valuable because of the difficulty in preparing pure CNS cultures of defined neu - ronal subpopulations in significant quantities . Several catecholaminergic cell lines exist . All , ex - cept the CATH . a line ( see below ) are partially derived from the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . Many sym - pathetic neuroblastomas exist , in addition to lines from adrenal medullary tumors . The most widely used cat - echolaminergic cell line is the neural crest - derived PC12 pheochromocytoma line which arose from a rat adrenal chromaffin tumor ( Greene & Tischler , 1976 ) . While the neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma lines are purely PNS in origin , several somatic hybrid lines ( MN9D and the MES23 . 5 lines ) have been gener - ated by fusion of a PNS neuroblastoma and a primary embryonic CNS catecholaminergic neuron ( Choi et al . , 1991 ; Crawford et al . , 1992 ) . Although the hybrid lines express differentiated properties , it is difficult to deter - * Present address : Department of Physiology , University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 4200 East Ninth Avenue , Denver , CO 80262 * * Present address : Department of Neurobiology , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , NC Correspondence to : M . Lazaroff J . Membrane Biol . 151 , 279 – 291 ( 1996 ) The Journal of MembraneBiology © Springer - Verlag New York Inc . 1996 mine to what degree PNS characteristics dominate or modify CNS - specific traits as chromosomes from both CNS and PNS parents persist in the hybrids . This is of particular concern because genes can be activated that were previously silent in the parental cells ( Minna , Yavelow & Coon , 1975 ; Me´vel - Ninio & Weiss , 1981 ) . To obtain a CNS cell line and avoid complications arising from biparental hybrids , tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) - expressing CNS tumors were induced in transgenic mice carrying the SV40T antigen oncogene under the transcriptional control of upstream elements from the rat TH gene . CATH . a was derived from such a brainstem tumor ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) . CATH . a cells appear morpho - logically undifferentiated under normal culture condi - tions ; only a small percentage possess short neurites . Nevertheless , they express some differentiated neuronal characteristics such as high levels of TH ( the first and rate - limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis ) , synaptophysin , and neurofilament protein . They do not express glial fibrillary acidic protein which is character - istically expressed in glial cells . CATH . a cells accumu - late and secrete high levels of dopamine and norepineph - rine . These data suggest that CATH . a cells are immor - talized derivatives of CNS catecholaminergic neurons ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) . To determine if CATH . a cells have membrane prop - erties characteristic of neurons , we tested for the pres - ence of voltage - gated inward currents using tight - seal , whole - cell recording ( Hamill et al . , 1981 ) . The results indicate that CATH . a cells possess voltage - gated sodium and calcium currents . The sodium currents are tetrodo - toxin - sensitive . The calcium currents are heterogeneous . Pharmacological results suggest the presence of L - and N - type calcium channels . However , in many cells , a sig - nificant fraction of the calcium current remains in the presence of selective antagonists for L - , N - , and P - type channels , suggesting that another calcium current ( ‘‘re - sistant’’ - type ) exists in these CATH . a cells which is not L - , N - , or P - type . Because CATH . a cells exhibited heterogeneity with respect to the current type and size , independent sub - clones were isolated and recorded from to determine whether the CATH . a cells were truly clonal . Surpris - ingly , heterogeneity persisted within each subclone , sug - gesting that differences between individual cells are not primarily due to genetically different subpopulations within the parental CATH . a cultures or within each sub - clone . This study and previous work ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) demonstrate that CATH . a cells express a neuronal phe - notype . Since the CATH . a cells can be grown continu - ously in large amounts , they may be useful for purifying , characterizing , and / or cloning various neuronal - specific molecules such as a ‘‘resistant’’ - type calcium channel . In addition , the CATH . a cells have been shown to be useful for investigating induction of TH transcription in response to membrane depolarization ( unpublished data ) . Future work will involve examining the mecha - nism of depolarization - induced TH transcription and possibly isolating the transcription factor ( s ) involved . Materials and Methods C ELL C ULTURE Cells were grown at 37°C and in 5 % CO 2 on tissue culture plastic ( Falcon , Becton Dickinson , Lincoln Park , NJ ) in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 8 % horse serum ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY ) , 4 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 % stocks were 10 , 000 U / ml penicillin G and 10 , 000 (cid:109) g / ml streptomycin sulfate ; Gibco ) . 24 – 48 hr before recording , cells were passaged using 0 . 25 % trypsin without EDTA ( Gibco ) to disrupt cell clumps ; the cells were replated on 35 mm Falcon tissue culture plates at low density such that isolated cells were easily obtained for recording . CATH . A S UBCLONES The CATH . a cells were subcloned twice in 96 - well microtiter tissue culture plates ( Falcon ) . Clones ( colonies derived from a single cell ) were identified by visual inspection and selected . Four subclones , C12C1 , A12A2 , A5H8 , and A5G11 , were obtained . A5H8 and A5G11 arose from the same parental subclone in the first cloning cycle , while C12C1 and A12A2 were independent isolates . E LECTROPHYSIOLOGY CATH . a cells ( or the various subclones ) on tissue culture plates were rinsed once with phosphate buffered saline and once with the appro - priate external bath solution . The cells were then placed in the external bath solution used for whole - cell recording . Standard tight - seal , whole - cell recordings were performed at room temperature with a List EPC - 7 patch - clamp amplifier . Current traces were digitized at 5 – 10 kHz . These were saved and analyzed on an Atari Mega 4 ST computer using data acquisition and analysis software from Instrutech ( Elmont , NY ) . Displayed records were not filtered further . A standard P / 4 pro - tocol starting from a holding potential of −100 mV was used to subtract linear components of capacitive and leak current from all trac - es . Although the cells varied in size , no correlation was observed be - tween current amplitude and membrane surface area ( proportional to cell capacitance ) . We , therefore , have reported most data in terms of current amplitudes ( pA ) . Voltage steps were applied to the test cell every 3 sec . Fisherbrand ( Pittsburgh , PA ) glass microhematocrit cap - illary tubes ( No . 02 - 668 - 68 ) were used to make patch pipettes . These were filled with the appropriate internal solution ( see below ) . Pipette resistances prior to forming high - resistance seals ranged from 1 . 75 to 4 . 0 megaohms . S OLUTIONS Solutions used for whole - cell recordings are described in Table 1 . For a general characterization of voltage - gated currents present in CATH . a cells and the CATH . a subclones , we used External solution # 1 280 M . Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line and Internal solution # 1 . To examine sodium currents in isolation , we used External solutions # 2 , 3 , and 4 and Puffer solutions # 1 and 2 , all containing cadmium and tetraethylammonium chloride ( TEA - Cl ) to block calcium and potassium currents , respectively and Internal solu - tions # 2 and 3 containing cesium to block potassium currents . To examine calcium currents in isolation we used External solution # 5 and Puffer solutions # 3 and 4 , all containing tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) and TEA - Cl to block sodium and potassium currents , respectively and Internal solution # 3 . C HEMICALS All drugs were stored as stock solutions at −20°C and then diluted in the appropriate external solution on the day of the experiment .

Scriabine , Miles Pharmaceuticals , respectively . Stock solu - tions of these dihydropyridines were made at a concentration of 10 m M in 95 % ethanol ; working concentrations were 10 (cid:109) M and 5 (cid:109) M for ( + ) - ( S ) - 202 - 791 and nimodipine , respectively . (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA ( Bachem , Torrance , CA ) was stored as a stock solution of 1 m M in distilled water ; working concentration was 10 (cid:109) M . (cid:118) - agatoxin - IVA ( Peptides International , Louisville , KY ) was stored as a stock solution of 100 (cid:109) M in distilled water ; working concentration was 100 – 200 nm . Drugs were applied via a puffer with a tip diameter of approximately 5 (cid:109) M . Table 1 .

Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line Results G ENERAL P ROPERTIES OF V OLTAGE - GATED C URRENTS IN CATH . A C ELLS Whole - cell voltage - clamp recording revealed that the CATH . a cells express several biophysically distinct volt - age - gated currents . We detected a rapidly inactivating inward current in all cells ( n (cid:52) 44 / 44 ) , a long - lasting inward current in 68 % of the cells ( n (cid:52) 30 / 44 ) , and a delayed outward current in 66 % of the cells ( n (cid:52) 29 / 44 ) . The cells can be divided into four classes defined by the various combinations of currents detected : ( i ) a transient inward current alone ( 4 / 44 ; Fig . 1 A ) , ( ii ) transient and long - lasting inward currents ( 11 / 44 ; Fig . 1 B ) , ( iii ) tran - sient inward and delayed outward currents ( 10 / 44 ; Fig . 1 C ) , and ( iv ) transient inward , long - lasting inward , and delayed outward currents ( 19 / 44 ; Fig . 1 D ) . A histogram summarizing these data is shown in Fig . 1 E . The transient inward current activated near −40 mV , reached its peak at −10 mV , and was similar to voltage - gated sodium currents observed in other excitable cells . The long - lasting inward current activated between −40 and −30 mV , peaked near + 10 to + 20 mV , and appeared similar to high voltage - activated calcium currents ob - served in other preparations . The delayed outward cur - rent was revealed with depolarizing pulses above 0 mV . It increased monotonically with increasing depolariza - tion and appeared similar to some voltage - gated potas - sium currents . In cells where all three currents were de - tected , the long - lasting inward current was most easily observed at potentials between −10 and + 10 mV . The delayed outward current masked the inward current at more depolarized potentials . Fig . 1 . Heterogeneity of voltage - gated membrane currents in CATH . a cells .

Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line T HE R APIDLY I NACTIVATING I NWARD C URRENT IS THROUGH T ETRODOTOXIN - S ENSITIVE S ODIUM C HANNELS To examine the transient inward current in isolation , we blocked calcium and potassium currents ( External solu - tions # 2 , 3 , 4 and Internal solution # 2 , 3 ) . Cadmium in the external solutions entirely eliminated the long - lasting inward current ; external tetraethylammonium chloride ( TEA - Cl ) and internal cesium largely blocked outward currents , although they were occasionally detected at test potentials more positive than + 60 mV . The threshold for activation of this inward current was −40 ± 4 mV ( n (cid:52) 19 ; Fig . 2 A and B ) . Peak current was reached at −10 ± 6 mV ( n (cid:52) 19 ; Fig . 2 A and B ) . Fig . 2 .

External solution # 4 ; Puffer solution # 2 ; Internal solution # 3 . 283 M . Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line Typically peak current amplitudes varied between 200 pA and 1000 pA ( mean (cid:52) 590 ± 319 pA ; n (cid:52) 17 ) ; however , in 2 other cells it approached 5 nA . Current densities ranged from 1 . 4 – 6 . 7 pA / (cid:109) m 2 . The current re - versed at + 55 ± 8 mV ( n (cid:52) 19 ; Fig . 2 A and B ) . Run - down of the transient inward current was not observed in cells voltage - clamped for as long as 45 min . Several observations support the contention that the transient inward current flows through voltage - dependent sodium channels . First , the reversal potential is near + 55 mV , close to the calculated Nernst potential of + 62 mV for sodium under our recording conditions . Second , the amplitude of the current greatly diminishes in a reversible manner at all test potentials from −80 to + 80 mV when the NaCl in the external solution is re - placed with N - methyl - D - glucamine ( NMDG ) , which is impermeant through sodium channels ( Fig . 2 C ) . Finally , the current activates near −40 mV ; at −10 mV , it acti - vates within 0 . 7 msec and inactivates in an exponential manner ( (cid:116) (cid:52) 0 . 7 msec ) . The reversal potential , sodium dependence , threshold potential , activation and inactiva - tion kinetics are similar to those of voltage - dependent sodium currents characterized in other excitable cells ( Fernandex , Fox & Krasne , 1984 ; Stu¨hmer et al . , 1987 ; Mandel et al . , 1988 ; Barres , Chun & Corey , 1989 ) . Pharmacological experiments provided additional evidence for the presence of voltage - gated sodium chan - nels in CATH . a cells . Puffer application of 250 n M te - trodotoxin ( TTX ) , a specific and potent ( K d (cid:52) 1 – 10 n M ) sodium channel blocker , eliminated the transient inward current at all test potentials from −80 to + 80 mV in CATH . a cells ( Fig . 2 D ) . This block was completely re - versible following washout of TTX . Together these data argue strongly that the transient inward current in CATH . a cells is due to the activation of TTX - sensitive sodium channels . T HE L ONG - LASTING I NWARD C URRENT IS D UE TO THE A CTIVATION OF C ALCIUM C HANNELS Sixty - eight percent of CATH . a cells exhibited a long - lasting inward current similar to high voltage - activated ( HVA ) calcium currents observed in other cells . To iso - late this current , we blocked sodium and potassium cur - rents ( External solution # 5 , Internal solution # 3 ) . Only the long - lasting inward current was regularly observed . The amplitude of the long - lasting inward current varied among different cells , ranging between 40 – 300 pA at its peak , and averaging 175 ± 67 pH ( n (cid:52) 8 ) . Current densities ranged from 0 . 57 – 1 . 9 pA / (cid:109) m 2 . In con - trast to previously characterized HVA calcium currents , rundown was insignificant in CATH . a cells voltage - clamped up to 20 min ( n (cid:52) 10 ) ; time points after 20 min were examined in 2 cells where rundown was not ob - served for as long as 45 min . However , similar to other HVA calcium currents , the current - voltage relationship ( Fig . 3 A , B ) demonstrates that the long - lasting inward current activated between −40 and −30 mV , peaked be - tween + 10 to + 20 mV , and reversed at + 66 ± 6 mV ( n (cid:52) 8 ) . The current was calcium dependent as it was blocked by cadmium , one of the several divalent cations known to effectively block voltage - gated calcium channels ( Hagiwara & Byerly , 1981 ; 1983 ; Nachshen , 1984 ; By - erly , Chase & Stimers , 1985 ; Lansman , Hess & Tsien , 1986 ) . Puffer application of 50 or 100 (cid:109) M cadmium in the standard external solution reversibly blocked the in - ward current at all test potentials ( −80 to + 80 mV ; Fig . 3 C ) . Furthermore , the amplitude of the inward current was dependent on the external calcium concentration . When cells were switched from a standard high calcium external solution ( 10 m M ) to a low calcium solution ( 0 . 1 m M ) , the long - lasting inward current became greatly di - minished at all test potentials ( −80 to + 80 mV ; Fig . 3 D and E ) and this effect was fully reversible . Together , these observations suggest that this current is generated through HVA calcium channels . P HARMACOLOGICAL C HARACTERIZATION OF C ALCIUM C URRENTS Several types of HVA calcium current ( L - , N - , and P - type ) have been defined by their sensitivity to selective pharmacological agents : 1 , 4 - dihydropyridines for L - type , (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA for N - type , and (cid:118) - agatoxin - IVA for P - type ( Tsien et al . , 1988 ; Bean , 1989 ; Hess , 1990 ; Catterall & Striessnig , 1992 ; Tsien , Ellinor & Horne , 1991 ; Llina´s et al . , 1992 ; Miller , 1992 ; Snutch & Reiner , 1992 ; Dunlap , Luebke & Turner , 1995 ) . We uti - lized these agents to characterize calcium currents in CATH . a cells . To test for the presence of L - type calcium currents , we employed both agonist and antagonist dihydropyri - dines ( Hess , Lansman & Tsien , 1984 ; Nowycky , Fox & Tsien , 1985 a ; Hof et al . , 1985 ; Kokubun et al . , 1986 ; Fox , Nowycky & Tsien , 1987 a , b ; Hosey & Lazdunski , 1988 ; Plummer , Logothetis & Hess , 1989 ) . 1 , 4 - dihydropyridine agonists , such as ( + ) - ( S ) - 202 - 791 , pro - long L - type channel open time and hence increase the whole - cell calcium current ; they also shift the voltage dependence of activation causing the I - V relationship to shift to more hyperpolarizing potentials . In 15 out of 23 CATH . a cells , puffer application of 10 (cid:109) M ( + ) - ( S ) - 202 - 791 increased the calcium current by 102 ± 41 % ( at test potentials of −10 to 0 mV ) and produced a hyperpolar - izing shift in the I - V curve ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . The rela - tively slow voltage clamp provided by the high - resistance patch pipettes required for recording from the CATH . a cells prevented us from discriminating a change in tail current deactivation kinetics that is commonly observed with dihydropyridine agonists acting on L - type channels ( Plummer et al . , 1989 ) . 284 M . Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line Puffer application of 5 (cid:109) M nimodipine , a dihydro - pyridine antagonist , reduced the calcium current evoked by step depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 mV by 42 ± 13 % in 9 out of 10 CATH . a cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . Previous studies suggest that dihydropyridine antago - nists work more effectively when cells are clamped at more positive holding potentials ( Bean , 1984 ; Sangui - netti & Kass , 1984 ) . However , we did not determine whether nimodipine blocked calcium currents more ef - fectively when CATH . a cells were clamped at more posi - tive holding potentials because control calcium currents evoked from holding potentials more positive than −50 mV were too small ( < 40 pA ) to measure reliably . The ( + ) - ( S ) - 202 - 791 and nimodipine effects on calcium cur - rents suggest that part of the calcium current is carried through L - type calcium channels in 73 % of the CATH . a cells ( 24 / 33 cells ; combined results from nimodipine and ( + ) - S - 202 - 791 experiments ) .

Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line To test for the presence of N - type calcium currents , we employed (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA , a peptide from the marine snail Conus geographus which irreversibly blocks N - type currents ( Olivera et al . , 1984 , 1985 , 1990 ; Aosaki & Kasai , 1989 ; Plummer et al . , 1989 ) . Puffer application of 10 (cid:109) M (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA irreversibly de - creased the calcium current by 40 ± 16 % in 8 out of 23 ( 35 % ) CATH . a cells ( Fig . 4 D ) . These results suggest that in 35 % of the CATH . a cells , part of the calcium current is carried through N - type calcium channels . The above findings suggest that specific pharmaco - logical agents of L - and N - type channels affect distinct calcium current classes in CATH . a cells , one sensitive to dihydropyridines and the other sensitive to (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA . This interpretation is further supported by results of experiments in which currents were not blocked by puffer application of 10 (cid:109) M (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA but were potentiated by subsequent application of 10 (cid:109) M ( + ) - ( S ) - 202 - 791 ( dihydropyridine - sensitive / (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA - resistant current ) . Additional evidence for the existence of distinct L - and N - type channel classes comes from experiments in which calcium currents were blocked by puffer application of 10 (cid:109) M (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA but not by the presence of 5 (cid:109) M nimodipine in the external so - lution ( (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA - sensitive / dihydropyridine - resistant current ) . The demonstration that dihydropyri - dine - sensitive / (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA - resistant and (cid:118) - cono - toxin - GVIA - sensitive / dihydropyridine - resistant currents exist indicates the presence of distinct classes of L - and N - type currents , respectively . A peptide from the funnel web spider Agelenopsis aperta , (cid:118) - agatoxin - IVA , blocks P - type currents in Pur - kinje neurons ( Adams , Bindokas & Venema , 1992 ; Mintz et al . , 1992 a , b ) ; at concentrations higher than 200 n M , (cid:118) - agatoxin - IVA may block other types of calcium current as well ( Sather et al . , 1993 ; Soong et al . , 1993 ) . Puffer application of 100 – 200 n M (cid:118) - agatoxin - IVA for up to 3 min did not affect the calcium current in any of 17 CATH . a cells suggesting that P - type calcium channels are not present in CATH . a cells . HVA currents could still be detected when CATH . a cells were bathed in a solution containing 5 (cid:109) M nimo - dipine , 10 (cid:109) M (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA , and 200 n M (cid:118) - aga - toxin - IVA , suggesting the presence of calcium channels which are not L - , or N - , or P - type . The average size of these ‘‘resistant’’ currents was 75 ± 16 pA ( n (cid:52) 9 ) . Fifty - five percent of the cells ( 9 / 16 ) exhibited this ‘‘re - sistant’’ HVA current . The presence of ‘‘resistant’’ cur - rents was further confirmed when 10 (cid:109) M ( + ) - ( S ) - 202 - 791 was puffer applied to CATH . a cells bathed in a solution containing 10 (cid:109) M (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA and 200 n M (cid:118) - agatoxin - IVA ; in 50 % of the cells ( 4 / 8 ) exhibiting a calcium current , ( + ) - ( S ) - 202 - 791 had no effect .

In summary , in 73 % of the CATH . a cells exhibiting a calcium current , about 40 % of the current was dihy - dropyridine - sensitive , indicating flow through L - type channels ; in 35 % of the cells expressing a calcium cur - rent , 40 % of the current was sensitive to (cid:118) - conotoxin - GVIA , indicating the presence of N - type channels . In 55 % of the cells with a HVA calcium current , approxi - mately half of the current was resistant to a combination of L - , N - , and P - type channel antagonists , suggesting the presence of HVA channels which are not L - , N - , or P - type . VOLTAGE - GATED C URRENTS IN CATH . A S UBCLONES It is possible that the heterogeneity in voltage - gated cur - rents expressed amongst different CATH . a cells was due to genetically different subpopulations within the CATH . a cultures . To test this possibility , the CATH . a cells were subcloned twice at limiting dilution in microti - ter wells and those colonies that arose from a single cell were identified by visual inspection . Whole - cell record - ings were then performed on four subclones . The C12C1 and A12A2 subclones were independent isolates , while A5H8 and A5G11 were sibling colonies from the same first - cycle parental clone . Surprisingly , within each subclone , heterogeneity still persisted . However , the C12C1 , A12A2 , and A5H8 differed from the parental CATH . a cells . Almost all C12C1 , A12A2 , and A5H8 cells exhibited putative po - tassium currents ( 93 % , 93 % , and 100 % respectively ) in contrast to 66 % of the parental CATH . a cells . Few ( 34 % , 0 % , and 16 % respectively ) expressed detectable calcium currents although 68 % of the parental CATH . a cells did ( Table 2 A ) . Almost all C12C1 , A12A2 , and A5H8 cells , like the parental CATH . a cells , exhibited sodium currents ( average amplitude 500 – 648 pA ; Table 2 A and C ) . The A5G11 line differed the most from the parental line . Only 50 % of A5G11 cells exhibited a small sodium current ( 153 ± 127 pA ; Table 2 A and C ) . This was particularly surprising given that its sibling clone , A5H8 , behaved like the parental CATH . a line and consistently exhibited a sodium current . However , the A5G11 cells were similar to the other subclones in re - gard to potassium ( 94 % ) and calcium ( 12 % ) current ex - pression . The currents were observed in various combi - nations and amplitudes amongst individual cells within each subclone as they were in the parental CATH . a cells ( Table 2 B and C ) . In total , these results suggest that genetic heterogeneity of the parental CATH . a line can account only partially for the heterogeneity in types and levels of voltage - gated currents . Discussion The major finding of this study is that CATH . a cells possess voltage - gated TTX - sensitive sodium currents and HVA calcium currents similar to those found in other neuronal preparations . By extending the number of neuronal properties characterized in these cells ( e . g . , Suri et al . , 1993 ) , this study further supports the use of CATH . a cells for biochemical and molecular studies of CNS catecholaminergic neurons . Because CATH . a cells are noradrenergic , it is likely that they originated from the locus coeruleus or lateral tegmental nuclei . Prelimi - nary evidence supports this contention ( Duman , Terwil - liger & Nestler , Soc . Neurosci . Abstr . 18 , 343 . 5 , 1992 ) . CATH . a cells express corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF ) and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) receptors which activate adenylate cyclase and express (cid:97) 2 adren - ergic , opiate , and neuropeptide ( NPY ) receptors which inhibit adenylate cyclase . These receptor responses are typical of those found in the locus coeruleus neurons in vivo . We demonstrated that calcium currents in CATH . a cells are heterogeneous ; they are affected by agonists and antagonists of L - and N - type currents to varying extents . In addition , a ‘‘resistant’’ HVA calcium current is de - tectable in some cells . This ‘‘resistant’’ current may be similar to that reported by Regan , Sah & Bean ( 1991 ) and Mintz et al . ( 1992 a ) in various neuronal prepara - tions . These results suggest that CATH . a cells express L - , N - , and ‘‘resistant’’ - type calcium currents . For the purposes of this study , we characterized cal - cium currents as L - type based on their sensitivity to di - hydropyridines and their insensitivity to N - and P - type channel blockers . Although a common characteristic of L - type channels is insensitivity to more positive holding potentials ( Nowycky , Fox & Tsien , 1985 b ; Fox et al . , 1987 a , b ) , the L - type channels in CATH . a cells do show voltage - dependent inactivation at a holding potential of −50 mV . However , defining calcium currents on the ba - sis of their voltage - dependent inactivation is not absolute in all systems ( Plummer et al . , 1989 ; Cox & Dunlap , 1992 ) . It is possible that L - type channels in CATH . a cells are of a different molecular composition than those pre - viously described thereby causing them to inactivate at more positive holding potentials . For example , it is pos - sible that they contain different auxiliary subunits which affect channel function . Alternatively , the ion - conducting (cid:97) subunit of L - type channels in CATH . a cells may be encoded by a novel L - type channel gene or may be an alternatively spliced product of a previously de - scribed L - type channel gene . Finally , L - type channels in CATH . a cells may differ in their post - translational modifications thereby promoting voltage dependent in - activation . L - and N - type currents have also been defined on the 287 M . Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line basis of their inactivation kinetics ; initially , L - type cur - rents were defined by their slow inactivation and N - type currents by their relatively rapid inactivation ( Nowycky et al . , 1985 b ; Fox et al . , 1987 a , b ) . However , defining calcium currents on the basis of their inactivation kinet - ics is not absolute in all systems . The existence of slowly inactivating N - type currents has been demon - strated in some neurons including sympathetic neurons ( Plummer et al . , 1989 ; Jones & Marks , 1989 a , b ) . In CATH . a cells the L - type currents are slowly inactivating . CATH . a cells express both slowly inactivating and rap - idly inactivating N - type current . Upon blocking the slowly inactivating L - type current with nimodipine in Fig . 4 C , a rapidly inactivating current is unmasked sug - gesting that this cell expresses an L - type current and a more rapidly inactivating N - type current . In other cells slowly inactivating N - type currents were revealed . Different calcium channel types mediate different cellular functions such as neurotransmitter release and neuronal gene induction in various cell types . Biochemi - cal studies using a rapid superfusion system to measure subsecond , calcium - dependent [ H 3 ] glutamate release from rat cortical and hippocampal synaptosomes have demonstrated that release is largely blocked by (cid:118) - aga - toxin - IVA , indicating that P - type channels are involved ( Turner , Adams & Dunlap , 1992 ; Luebke , Dunlap & Turner , 1993 ) . In hippocampal synaptosomes , (cid:118) - cono - toxin - GVIA partially blocks release , suggesting that N - type channels are also involved ( Luebke et al . , 1993 ) .

Lazaroff et al . : Voltage - gated Currents in a CNS Line cortical and hippocampal synaptosomes is not com - pletely blocked by these toxins , ‘‘resistant’’ - type cal - cium channels may also be involved ( Turner et al . , 1992 ; Luebke et al . , 1993 ) . It is conceivable that biochemical studies using a rapid superfusion system can be per - formed with CATH . a cells to investigate the relative im - portance of L - , N - , and ‘‘resistant’’ - type calcium chan - nels to catecholamine release in these cells . CATH . a cells should be amenable to these biochemical studies . The heterogeneity of CATH . a cells should not be prob - lematic for such studies considering that CATH . a cells are significantly less heterogeneous than rat cortical and hippocampal synaptosome preparations which have pro - vided valuable information regarding neurotransmitter release . Furthermore , since CATH . a cells can easily be transfected ( Lazaroff et al . , 1995 ) , they offer the unique opportunity to introduce genes which may affect the re - lease pathway and alter neurotransmitter secretion . L - type calcium channel activation during prolonged membrane depolarization has been shown to mediate in - duction of the c - fos gene via the cyclic - AMP response element ( CRE ) in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons ( reviewed in Sheng & Greenberg , 1990 ; Ghosh & Green - berg , 1995 ) . TH is also induced by membrane depolarization in vivo and in cell culture systems , however , the mechanism is less well understood ( Dreyfus et al . , 1986 ; Faucon - Biquet et al . , 1989 ; Schalling et al . , 1989 ; Ehrlich et al . , 1990 ; Banerjee et al . , 1992 ; Kilbourne et al . , 1992 ) . We have found that membrane depolarization of CATH . a cells increases TH transcription 100 – 200 % via the CRE ( unpublished data ) . Future work will involve examining the mechanism of this induction and the voltage - gated channels required . Whether the voltage - gated sodium and calcium channel density in CATH . a cells can be increased by differentiation remains to be determined . We observed no increase in channel density with dibutyryl cAMP treatment which has been shown to increase sodium channel density in PC12 cells ( Kalman et al . , 1990 ) and promote differentiation in some neuronal cell lines ( Pra - sad , 1975 ; De Laat & van der Saag , 1982 ; Rupniak et al . , 1984 ) . However , growth in serum - free medium resulted in a 2 - to 3 - fold increase in average sodium current size without affecting calcium current size , although the CATH . a cells did not appear more differentiated mor - phologically ( unpublished observations ) . CATH . a cells lack NGF receptors and do not respond to NGF ( unpub - lished data ) . Among different CATH . a cells , heterogeneity exists in the types and amounts of voltage - gated currents ex - pressed . These differences between individual cells are not primarily due to genetically distinct subpopulations since four subclones obtained from the CATH . a cells also exhibit heterogeneity in the types and amounts of voltage - gated currents expressed . It is possible that dif - ferences in channel expression are related to where cells are in the cell cycle or are due to unidentified microen - vironmental cues . For example , channel expression may be induced or repressed by factors secreted by the cells or interactions between cells . It is now possible to investi - gate whether various growth factors influence voltage - gated channel expression in the parental CATH . a cells and the various subclones . As only 50 % of the A5G11 cells express sodium currents and these currents are con - siderably smaller than those expressed in the other sub - clones , comparison of sodium channel gene regulation in the A5G11 cells to that in other subclones may provide insights regarding induction / repression of sodium cur - rent expression . Despite some heterogeneity , the C12C1 , A12A2 , and A5H8 cells are more homogeneous than the parental CATH . a cells ; in particular , almost all exhibit sodium and putative potassium currents whereas few have cal - cium currents . This greater uniformity within the sub - clones suggests that some heterogeneity in the parental CATH . a population may be due to genetic differences between cells . The parental CATH . a cells were origi - nally derived from small clumps of cells ( 1 – 10 cells ) because of the low efficiency of growing a colony from a single cell . The subcloning procedure employed here demanded that a single cell give rise to a colony ; thus clones may have been selected that express a particular subset of channels , i . e . , more potassium and less calcium current . The fact that three independent subclones were quite similar to each other argues that the subcloning procedure may have been a factor in selecting clones with a similar phenotype . This study and previous work ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) demonstrate that CATH . a cells express a neuronal phe - notype . Since the CATH . a cells can be grown continu - ously in large amounts , they may be useful for purifying , characterizing , and / or cloning various neuronal - specific molecules regardless of their heterogeneity . In future work , it may be possible to purify , characterize , and / or clone a ‘‘resistant’’ - type calcium channel from CATH . a cells . In addition , the CATH . a cells will be used to fur - ther investigate membrane depolarization - induced ex - pression of TH through the CRE and possibly isolate the transcription factor ( s ) involved . These studies are often not feasible when using small regions of dissected brain tissue or primary cultures where heterogeneity exists to a much greater extent and where the cells of interest may comprise a smaller percentage of the total population . The CATH . a cell line may contribute to our understand - ing of biochemical , molecular , and electrophysiological properties of CNS catecholaminergic brainstem neurons .
