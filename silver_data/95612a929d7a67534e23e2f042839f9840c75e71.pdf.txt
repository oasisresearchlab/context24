Rac1 binds to WRC at 26 two distinct sites—the A and D sites . Precisely how Rac1 binds and how the binding 27 triggers WRC activation remain unknown . Here we report WRC structures by itself , and 28 when bound to single or double Rac1 molecules , at ~ 3 Å resolutions by cryogenic - electron 29 microscopy . The structures reveal that Rac1 binds to the two sites by distinct mechanisms , 30 and binding to the A site , but not the D site , drives WRC activation . Activation involves a 31 series of unique conformational changes leading to the release of sequestered WCA ( WH2 - 32 central - acidic ) polypeptide , which stimulates the Arp2 / 3 complex to polymerize actin . 33 Together with biochemical and cellular analyses , the structures provide a novel 34 mechanistic understanding of how the Rac1 - WRC - Arp2 / 3 - actin signaling axis is regulated 35 in diverse biological processes and diseases . 36 37 Ding et al 3 The Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) family proteins play a central role 38 in promoting Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly in a wide range of processes , including cell 39 migration and intracellular vesicle trafficking 1 , 2 . These proteins share a conserved C - 40 terminal WCA ( WH2 - central - acidic ) sequence , which can bind to and stimulate the Arp2 / 3 41 complex to produce branched actin networks at membranes 1 , 2 . Most WASP - family 42 proteins are inhibited in the basal state 1 . Inhibition is achieved by keeping their WCA 43 sequence sequestered either in cis within a single polypeptide chain , as in WASP and N - 44 WASP , or in trans within large multi - protein complexes , as in WAVE and WASH 3 – 10 . A 45 variety of upstream signals , including ligand binding ( e . g . , GTPases , inositol phospholipids , 46 membrane receptors , and scaffolding proteins ) and post - translational modifications ( e . g . , 47 phosphorylation and ubiquitination ) , often act cooperatively in the cell to relieve the 48 inhibition and simultaneously recruit WASP - family proteins to their target membrane 49 locations to promote actin polymerization 8 , 10 – 17 . 50 The WASP - family member WAVE exists exclusively in a 400 - kDa , hetero - 51 pentameric assembly named the WAVE Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) 18 . Essential to most 52 eukaryotic organisms , the WRC plays a key role in promoting actin polymerization at 53 plasma membranes and producing sheet - like membrane protrusions known as lamellipodia , 54 commonly found at the leading edge of migrating cells 2 , 4 . Genetic mutations in various 55 subunits of the WRC are frequently associated with human diseases , including 56 neurodevelopmental disorders , immune syndromes , and many types of cancer 18 . 57 WRC by itself exist in an autoinhibited state 6 – 8 . Previous crystal structures of a 58 minimal , inhibited WRC ( WRC xtal ) revealed the overall structural organization and the 59 inhibition mechanism 8 , 12 . The studied complex is composed of a trimer formed by WAVE1 , 60 Ding et al 4 Abi2 , and HSPC300 , and a dimer formed by Sra1 and Nap1 subunits ( Fig . 1A ) . WAVE1 61 has a conserved sequence of ~ 100 amino acids ( a . a . ) defined as the “meander” sequence , 62 which meanders across the surface of Sra1 as a loose collection of loops and short helices 8 63 ( Fig . 1A ) . The meander region and a conserved surface on Sra1 collectively comprise the 64 WCA - binding site , which sequesters the WCA from accessing the Arp2 / 3 complex 8 . 65 A large variety of ligands can recruit WRC to membranes through direct 66 interactions and / or simultaneously activate it 18 . Among these ligands , the Rho - family 67 GTPase Rac1 is the ubiquitous activator of WRC 18 . Prior studies have shown that direct 68 binding of Rac1 to the WRC is necessary and , in many cases , sufficient to drive WRC 69 activation 5 , 11 , 12 , 19 – 21 . Determining how Rac1 binds to and activates WRC is key to 70 understanding the regulation and function of WRC - mediated signaling in diverse cellular 71 processes . 72 Previous biochemical and low - resolution cryo - EM studies proposed two distinct 73 Rac1 - binding sites on WRC 8 , 19 . Both sites were mapped on conserved surfaces of Sra1 , 74 which are separated by ~ 100 Å on the opposite ends of the WRC . The site a djacent to the 75 WCA was referred to as the A site , and the one d istant from the WCA as the D site 19 ( Fig . 76 1A ) . The two sites thus allow simultaneous binding of two individual Rac1 molecules , 77 albeit with distinct affinities , with the D site binding ~ 40 - 100 times stronger than the A 78 site 19 . Mutating key residues at either site abolished WRC activation by Rac1 in pyrene - 79 actin polymerization assays , suggesting both sites are critical for WRC activation 19 . In vivo , 80 however , the A site seemed to play a more important role in promoting lamellipodia 81 formation in both mammalian and amoeba cells , despite its much lower affinity for Rac1 21 . 82 Mutating the A site almost completely abolished lamellipodia formation , while mutating 83 Ding et al 5 the D site did not eliminate lamellipodia formation , but compromised their general 84 morphology 21 . Without high - resolution structures of the WRC bound to Rac1 , it remains 85 unclear how Rac1 binds the two sites and , more importantly , how Rac1 binding triggers 86 WRC activation . 87 Here we report WRC structures determined to ~ 3 Å resolutions by single - particle 88 cryogenic - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) in three different states : without Rac1 , with 89 Rac1 only bound to the D site , and with Rac1 molecules bound to both A and D sites 90 simultaneously . The structures reveal in detail how Rac1 interacts with both sites , and how 91 Rac1 - WRC interaction drives WRC activation . We find Rac1 uses two distinct 92 mechanisms to bind the two sites , and only binding to the A site , but not to the D site , 93 directly contributes to WRC activation . Rac1 binding to the A site flattens the interaction 94 surface and allosterically destabilizes a conserved region in the meander sequence of 95 WAVE1 critical for autoinhibition . These conformational changes release the sequestered 96 WCA sequence , making it accessible to Arp2 / 3 . Coupled with biochemical and cellular 97 studies , the new structures resolve a central mechanism of WRC activation , a key step in 98 Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin filament assembly in the cell . 99 100 Results 101 Structural solutions to understand Rac1 binding to WRC 102 Prior structural studies of WRC led to the identification of the A and D sites , but 103 could not determine the binding or activation mechanism due to several limitations 8 , 19 . The 104 crystal structures used a “minimal WRC” ( WRC xtal ) that lacked the polypeptide region ( a . a . 105 187 - 230 was deleted from WAVE1 ) necessary for activation , and hence could not be 106 Ding et al 6 activated by Rac1 8 , 19 . The cryo - EM structure of WRC bound to a single Rac1 lacked WCA 107 ( WRC 230∆WCA - Rac1 ) , and its limited resolution could not precisely delineate how Rac1 binds 108 to the D site , or whether D site Rac1 binding causes activation 19 . Moreover , many questions 109 about the A site remained open due to the lack of structural information , including exactly 110 where the proposed A site is , how Rac1 binds to it , and whether or how A site Rac1 binding 111 activates WRC . 112 Major challenge in addressing the aforementioned questions is the weak affinity 113 between Rac1 and WRC , especially at the A site 19 , which prevents the formation of stable 114 Rac1 - WRC complexes amenable for structural studies . To overcome this challenge , we 115 developed new strategies here to stabilize Rac1 binding . To optimize Rac1 binding to the 116 D site , we used a different tethering strategy than what was used in WRC 230∆WCA - Rac1 in the 117 previous study 19 ( Extended Data Fig . 2A , B ) . Firstly , we tethered Rac1 to the C - terminus 118 of Sra1 . This avoids tethering Rac1 to WAVE1 as in the previous strategy , which would 119 directly perturb WCA at the C - terminus of WAVE1 . Secondly , due to the close proximity 120 of Sra1 C - terminus to the D site , we used a significantly shorter , flexible peptide linker 121 ( shorter by 71 a . a . ) to tether Rac1 to WRC , which keeps Rac1 closer to the D site ( herein 122 referred to as WRC D - Rac1 ; Fig . 1B , red dot ) . In both the previous 19 and new constructs , we 123 use a Rac1 harboring Q61L / P29S mutations ( hereafter referred to as Rac1 or Rac1 QP 124 interchangeably ) , in which Q61L stabilizes GTP binding to Rac1 , and P29S ( an oncogenic 125 mutation identified in melanoma patients 22 , 23 ) enhances Rac1 binding to WRC 19 . 126 Stabilizing Rac1 binding to the A site was more challenging due to its lower affinity . 127 After exploring several different strategies , one of the approaches favored stable binding 128 of Rac1 to the A site ( Fig . 1C and Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . In this strategy , we inserted a 129 Ding et al 7 Rac1 QP to the middle of a non - conserved surface loop of Sra1 , between Y423 / S424 of a . a . 130 418 - 432 , using two separate flexible linkers . Additionally , we kept a Rac1 tethered to the 131 C - terminus of Sra1 as in WRC D - Rac1 . However , instead of using Rac1 QP , we used Rac1 P29S 132 for the D site as we found Rac1 P29S could be readily loaded with GDP or GTP ( or 133 GMPPPNP , a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog ) , while Rac1 QP remained locked to GTP in the 134 same condition ( Extended Data Fig . 3E ) . This unique feature allowed us to find that 1 ) 135 Rac1 tethered to the A site was sufficient to activate the WRC ( when Rac1 P29S at the D site 136 was loaded with GDP ) ; and 2 ) the D - site bound Rac1 could further improve WRC 137 activation by the A site bound Rac1 ( when Rac1 P29S at the D site is loaded with GMPPNP ) 138 ( Extended Data Fig . 3D ) . We refer to this construct as WRC AD - Rac1 . In both WRC D - Rac1 139 and WRC AD - Rac1 , we did not remove WCA to enhance Rac1 binding , which is contrary to 140 what was previously done for the WRC 230∆WCA - Rac1 construct 19 . Instead , we kept WCA 141 intact to unbiasedly validate the active state of the WRC - Rac1 complexes , both by activity 142 measurements and by the existence of WCA density in reconstructed maps ( Fig . 1 ) . 143 Using cryo - EM we determined structures of both WRC D - Rac1 and WRC AD - Rac1 , as 144 well as WRC apo ( WRC without tethered Rac1 ) to ~ 3 Å resolutions ( Fig . 1 , Extended Data 145 Fig . 1 - 3 , and Table S3 ) . The overall structures of WRC in these three complexes were 146 similar to the previous crystal structure ( WRC xtal ) 8 , with a root - mean - square deviation 147 ( r . m . s . d . ) of 0 . 83 - 1 . 22 Å ( Extended Data Fig . 1A ) . Except for local conformational 148 changes caused by A site Rac1 binding as described in detail below , Rac1 binding to either 149 A or D site did not cause large - scale , global conformational changes to WRC . The 150 additional sequence in WAVE1 , a . a . 187 - 230 , which was not included in the previous 151 WRC xtal construct , did not show any density in the cryo - EM reconstructions , suggesting 152 Ding et al 8 that this region is disordered in WRC . Additionally , the structures unambiguously 153 determined that the N - terminal helix of Sra1 ( a A , a . a . 5 - 22 ) belonged to the same complex , 154 instead of a neighboring WRC as suggested by the previous structural study using X - ray 155 crystallography 8 ( Fig . 1A , dark green , and Extended Data Fig . 1B , C ) . 156 Comparison between the WRC apo , WRC D - Rac1 , and WRC AD - Rac1 structures clearly 157 reveal that Rac1 binding to the A site , but not the D site , leads to WRC activation . In 158 WRC D - Rac1 , D site Rac1 binding did not cause obvious conformational changes ; neither did 159 it destabilize the meander sequence or the W and C helices ( Fig . 1B vs . 1A and Extended 160 Data Fig . 2 ) . By contrast , in WRC AD - Rac1 , the density for the W and C helices and part of 161 the meander region were not observed in the reconstructed map , suggesting that upon Rac1 162 binding to the A site , these sequences were destabilized and released from the WRC ( Fig . 163 1C ) . Consistent with these observations , the pyrene - actin polymerization assay showed 164 both WRC apo and WRC D - Rac1 were autoinhibited and could be activated by the addition of 165 free Rac1 ( Fig . 1D , E , blue curves ) , whereas WRC AD - Rac1 was basally active ( Fig . 1F , solid 166 blue curve ) . Furthermore , a WRC with Rac1 P29S only tethered to the A site , but not the D 167 site ( herein referred to as WRC A - Rac1 ) , was also basally active in a nucleotide - dependent 168 manner ( Extended Data Fig . 3D ) . Together , these results confirm that A site binding , but 169 not D site binding , causes WRC activation . 170 It is important to note that densities corresponding to the flexible peptide linkers 171 used to tether Rac1 to WRC were not visible in the reconstructed maps , not did we observe 172 perturbations of local structures surrounding the tethering points ( Extended Data Fig . 2C 173 and 3C ) . These observations indicate the linkers only facilitated binding by increasing the 174 local concentration of Rac1 , but did not influence or perturb the native structures or caused 175 Ding et al 9 artefactual conformational states . Additionally , the poise of Rac1 at both A and D sites is 176 consistent with how GTPases interact with effectors in general and is compatible with 177 WRC orientation at plasma membranes 19 ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . Furthermore , the WRCs 178 used in our structural and biochemical studies behaved similarly during chromatographic 179 purifications , showing no sign of mis - assembly or aggregation ( Table S1 , S2 ; Extended 180 Data Fig . 5 ) . Together with complementary structural , biochemical , and cellular analysis 181 described below , our structures represent the native binding states of Rac1 to WRC . 182 183 Interactions between Rac1 and the D site of WRC 184 Both WRC D - Rac1 and WRC AD - Rac1 show nearly identical structures of Rac1 binding 185 to the D site ( 0 . 53 Å r . m . s . d . ) . Compared to WRC apo , WRC D - Rac1 does not show major 186 structural differences ( 0 . 46 Å r . m . s . d . over the whole complexes ; Fig . 1A , B ) . Importantly , 187 the density for structural elements crucial to WRC activation , including the meander 188 sequence and WCA , remains intact and virtually identical to WRC apo , suggesting that D 189 site Rac1 binding does not directly promote WRC activation ( Fig . 1B ) . This is consistent 190 with results from pyrene - actin polymerization assays , which show WRC D - Rac1 is 191 autoinhibited ( Fig . 1E , solid blue curve ) . That this inhibition can be relieved by free Rac1 192 emphasizes that WRC D - Rac1 is a functional complex ( Fig . 1E , dashed blue curve ) , 193 The D site engages with Rac1 mainly through a largely hydrophobic surface of ~ 194 550 Å 2 presented by a . a . 961 - 978 of Sra1 , which contains a helix - turn - loop structure 195 formed by the H11b1 helix and the loop between H11b1 and H11a helices ( Fig . 2A , B and 196 Extended Data Fig . 3B ) . Solvent - exposed residues , including R961 , R964 , Y967 , E974 , 197 F975 , and H978 , form multiple hydrophobic , p - p stacking , and polar interactions with 198 Ding et al 10 several parts of Rac1 , including a small portion ( a . a . 36 - 39 ) of Switch I motif , the helical 199 part ( a . a . 64 - 66 ) of Switch II motif , and W56 at the N - terminus of Switch II ( Fig . 2B and 200 Extended Data Fig . 6A - D , P ) . 201 The peptide backbone of contacting residues in either Sra1 or Rac1 does not show 202 major structural changes upon Rac1 binding , except a shift of ~ 1 - 1 . 5 Å of the helix ( a . a . 203 64 - 70 ) in Switch II of Rac1 towards Sra1 ( Fig . 2D , black arrow ) . Several side chains , 204 however , undergo significant rotations to establish the binding . Among them , the side 205 chains of Y967 on Sra1 and F37 on Rac1 undertake a dramatic rotation of ~ 80° and 110° , 206 respectively , creating a tight p - p stacking between the two residues ( Fig . 2C , curved arrows , 207 and Extended Data Fig . 6A ) . Further , but less ideal stacking of two additional aromatic 208 residues , Rac1 W56 and Sra1 F975 , which flank the Sra1 Y967 - Rac1 F37 core , creates an “interlock” 209 to stabilize Rac1 binding ( Fig . 2C , D , black dotted lines ) . 210 In addition to the p - p stacking , the conformation of Rac1 F37 is stabilized by a 211 hydrophobic pocket formed by Rac1 V36 , L67 , L70 and Sra1 P963 , I972 , Y967 , G971 , F975 ( Extended 212 Data Fig . 6D ) . This Sra1 Y967 - Rac1 F37 core interaction is further stabilized by several polar 213 interactions at the periphery , including a cation - p interaction between Sra1 R964 and Rac1 W56 , 214 hydrogen bonding between Sra1 Y967 and Rac1 N39 and between Sra1 H978 and Rac1 Y64 , and 215 two salt bridges , one between Sra1 E974 and Rac1 R66 and the other between Sra1 R961 and 216 Rac1 D38 ( Fig . 2B - D , and Extended Data Fig . 6A - C , P ) . In particular , the guanidino group 217 of Rac1 R66 swings forward by ~ 4 Å to engage with Sra1 E974 , while the side chain of Sra1 R961 218 swings away to avoid steric clashes with Rac1 and engage with Rac1 D38 ( Fig . 2D , curved 219 arrows , Extended Data Fig . 6B , C ) . These structures are consistent with observations made 220 in prior studies 19 , 21 , where substituting the key residues at the D site , including Y967A , 221 Ding et al 11 G971W , R961D / P963A / R964D , and E974A / F975A / H978A / Q979A , all disrupted Rac1 222 binding to WRC . 223 224 General overview of Rac1 binding to the A site of WRC 225 When the A site is occupied by Rac1 , we noticed that the A site , the meander region , 226 and the WCA helices have undergone significant local conformational changes . This is in 227 clear contrast to what is observed when Rac1 binds to the D site . Particularly , no densities 228 are observed for WCA helices in WRC AD - Rac1 , which indicates Rac1 binding to the A site 229 activates the WRC ( Fig . 1C ) . This is consistent with the biochemical observations that 230 WRCs with Rac1 bound to the A site are always active , irrespective of Rac1 binding to the 231 D site ( Fig . 1F and Extended Data Fig . 3D ) . In the following two sections , we will answer 232 two important questions : 1 ) how Rac1 binds to the A site ; 2 ) how Rac1 binding leads to 233 WRC activation . 234 235 Interactions between Rac1 and the A site of WRC 236 The A site constitutes an extensive surface on the N - terminal region of Sra1 ( also 237 called the DUF1394 domain ; Extended Data Fig . 3B ) . Distinct from the D site , which is 238 flat , relatively small , and largely hydrophobic , the A site is concave , nearly two times larger 239 ( ~ 1138 Å 2 ) than the D site , and mostly positively charged ( Fig . 3A , B ) . On the Sra1 side , 240 the binding involves a . a . 91 - 108 ( helix H1b1 and loop L2 that connects H1a to H1b1 ) and 241 a . a . 176 - 215 ( mainly a B and a C helices ) ( Fig . 3A ) . On the Rac1 side , the interactions 242 involve the end of the a 1 helix ( a . a . 23 - 25 ) , most of Switch I ( a . a . 26 - 37 ) , the b 2 - b 3 beta - 243 sheet connecting Switch I and Switch II ( a . a . 38 - 55 ) , and the beginning of Switch II ( a . a . 244 Ding et al 12 56 - 70 ) ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Majority of the interactions differ from those between Rac1 and its 245 inhibitor CYRI - B ( CYFIP - related Rac1 interactor , or FAM49B ) , which shares a remote 246 homology with the A site region of Sra1 24 – 26 ( Extended Data Fig . 6P - S ) . 247 Given the low affinity , it is surprising that A site Rac1 binding is mediated by 248 numerous , mostly polar interactions , including 17 hydrogen bonds , 3 salt bridges , and 249 several hydrophobic interactions ( Fig . 3B and see Extended Data Fig . 6E - M , P for more 250 details ) . Among them , the interactions clustered around Sra1 R190 seem to play a particularly 251 important role . Sra1 R190 , which is strictly conserved in almost all organisms 8 , is anchored 252 within an acidic pocket on the Rac1 surface formed partially by the Switch I loop ( Fig . 3C ) . 253 The anchoring of R190 is stabilized by the formation of a salt bridge with Rac1 E31 , which 254 is further bolstered by many interactions at the ridges of the pocket , including salt bridges 255 between Sra1 K189 and Rac1 D38 , and Sra1 R104 and Rac1 E31 , hydrogen bonding between 256 Sra1 K189 and Rac1 F37 CO , Sra1 Y108 and Rac1 E31 , Sra1 V96 CO and Rac1 G30 NH , and Sra1 Q95 , V96 257 CO and Rac1 S29 ( details of P29S mutation in Rac1 is described in later section ) , as well as 258 a hydrophobic interaction between Sra1 F194 and Rac1 I33 ( Fig . 3C and Extended Data Fig . 259 6E - G , P ) . This Arginine anchor is unique to Sra1 and CYRI - B , as it is not observed in other 260 reported Rac1 binding proteins ( Extended Data Fig . 6S ) . Consistent with the structural 261 analysis , mutating R190 to Aspartic acid ( R190D ) in previous studies disrupted Rac1 262 binding in vitro and abolished WRC activity in lamellipodia formation 8 , 21 . 263 In addition to R190D , the structure also explains another previously studied 264 mutation at the A site , C179R , which is located distant from R190 , but similarly abolished 265 WRC activity 8 , 19 , 21 . Limited to small side chains in all examined organisms 8 , C179 is 266 tightly packed against a concave pocket on Rac1 ( Extended Data Fig . 6N ) . Although it 267 Ding et al 13 does not form any specific interactions with Rac1 , mutating C179 to the long - chain residue 268 Arginine would cause steric clashes to disrupt Rac1 binding to the A site . 269 To further understand the contributions of individual interactions , we mutated 270 several additional conserved contacting residues at the A site , including N176W , N183R , 271 S186M , and K189M . They form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with N52 , T24 / S41 272 NH / CO , N39 NH / CO , and D38 / F37 CO in Rac1 , respectively ( Fig . 3B and Extended Data 273 Fig . 6G , H , K ) . All mutations disrupted WRC activation in vitro ( Fig . 3D ) and reduced 274 lamellipodia formation upon re - introduction of corresponding variants into B16 - F1 275 Sra1 / Cyfip2 double knock - out ( KO ) cells 21 ( Fig . 3E and Extended Data Fig . 7B ) . The 276 mutations did not affect WRC purification in vitro and rescued WRC expression in the cell 277 ( Extended Data Fig . 5E - J and 7C ) , suggesting they did not interfere with protein folding 278 or complex assembly . It is intriguing that the effects of these mutants varied based on their 279 relative location in the A site . N183R and S186M , which are located at the center of A site , 280 strongly impaired WRC function , while N176W and K189M , which are located at the 281 periphery of the A site , had milder effects ( Fig . 3B , D , E ) . This suggests individual 282 interactions have different contributions to the overall binding to Rac1 , with residues at the 283 center of the A site having major contributions . It is worth noting that the efficiency of 284 these mutants in disrupting WRC’s function in vitro correlates well with their extent in 285 compromising lamellipodia formation in cells ( Fig . 3D vs . E ) , thus supporting the fact that 286 the biochemical activity of Rac1 in binding and activating the WRC is directly correlated 287 with WRC activity in promoting lamellipodia formation . 288 In addition to aforementioned mutations , the WRC AD - Rac1 structure explains the 289 phenotype of several mutations found in human patients . P29S in Rac1 was initially 290 Ding et al 14 identified as one of the major somatic mutations in human melanoma , shown to enhance 291 Rac1 binding to various effector proteins , including PAK1 ( p21 protein activated kinase 292 1 ) , MLK3 ( mixed - lineage kinase 3 ) , and the WRC 19 , 22 , 23 . For this reason , we included the 293 P29S mutation in our constructs in order to strengthen Rac1 binding 19 . Our structure shows 294 that P29S provides additional hydrogen bonding with Sra1 Q95 and Sra1 V96 CO , which 295 explains why this melanoma - causing mutation promoted WRC binding and activation 19 296 ( Fig . 3B and Extended Data Fig . 6E ) . 297 Furthermore , Y108H in the Sra1 homolog Cyfip2 ( which shares 88 % sequence 298 identity and is analogously incorporated into a WRC ) is one of the hotspot mutations found 299 in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy - 65 ( DEE - 65 ) 27 . Unlike other 300 hotspot mutations in DEE - 65 ( described later ) , Y108H does not seem to directly affect the 301 meander or WCA sequence . Our structure shows that Sra1 Y108 forms hydrogen bonds with 302 Rac1 E31 ( one of the aforementioned interactions at the ridges of the acidic pocket stabilizing 303 R190 anchoring ) ( Fig . 3B , C and Extended Data Fig . 6F ) . Replacing this Tyr to a His , 304 which has a similar size as Tyr , but is more polar and positively charged , may further 305 enhance this polar interaction to promote Rac1 binding and WRC activation . Consistent 306 with this prediction , Y108H in Sra1 mildly sensitized WRC activation by Rac1 ( Extended 307 Data Fig . 7A ) , whereas Y108A slightly reduced the sensitivity ( Fig . 3D and Extended 308 Data Fig . 7A ) . The effect of Y108H or Y108A was subtle , suggesting the Sra1 Y108 - Rac1 E31 309 interaction has a limited contribution to Rac1 binding . In fact , in our complementation 310 assays using B16 - F1 Sra1 / Cyfip2 KO cells , where Rac1 expression was not disrupted 21 , 311 neither Y108H nor Y108A significantly affected WRC - mediated lamellipodia formation 312 ( Fig . 3E and Extended Data Fig . 7B , C ) . In contrast , in previously published results using 313 Ding et al 15 a sensitized cell line , Sra1 / Cyfip2 / Rac1 / 2 / 3 KO B16 - F1 cells ( clone # 3 / 4 ) , where Rac1 314 expression was substantially reduced ( but not completely eliminated ) making lamellipodia 315 formation more sensitive to Rac1 - WRC interaction , Y108H mutation indeed enhanced 316 WRC - dependent actin remodeling 28 . These observations provide an example that even a 317 moderate enhancement of WRC activity in the cell by Y108H mutation can disrupt the 318 finely tuned regulation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly , ultimately manifesting as a 319 neurological disease . 320 Having understood the underlying mechanism of Rac1 binding to the A site , we 321 next examine how this binding leads to WRC activation . 322 323 Rac1 binding to the A site causes activating conformational changes in WRC 324 Despite the extensive interactions between Rac1 and A site , why does Rac1 bind to 325 the A site with low affinity ? By comparing the WRC D - Rac1 with WRC AD - Rac1 structure , we 326 find that the conformation of the A site in WRC D - Rac1 is not compatible with Rac1 binding . 327 In particular , Rac1 binding would directly clash into part of the L2 loop ( Fig . 4A and 328 Extended Data Fig . 8A ) . To accommodate Rac1 binding , the A site must undergo a major 329 conformational change , which involves flattening the concave binding surface by ~ 8° . 330 This flattening is caused by an outward rotation of several key structural elements at the A 331 site , including H1b1 helix , N - terminus of H1b2 , loop L2 , and a B - loop - a C , relative to a 332 pivot axis running roughly through R87 in the L2 loop , K178 in the loop between H2a and 333 a B , and N124 in H1b2 , while keeping the neighboring structures beyond the pivot axis , 334 including H1a , most part of H1b2 , H2a , H2b , and H8a , unchanged ( Fig . 4A , B , black arrows , 335 Ding et al 16 and Extended Data Fig . 8A - C ) . The cost of the A site undergoing this conformational 336 change could antagonize Rac1 binding and reduce Rac1’s affinity to the A site significantly . 337 Another major conformational change occurring simultaneously when Rac1 binds 338 to the A site is the release of the C - terminal half of the meander sequence in WAVE1 ( after 339 Q130 , except part of the a 4 which is accounted for by a poorly defined density in WRC AD - 340 Rac1 ) , together with the W and C helices ( Fig . 4B , dark magenta vs . light pink ) . The release 341 of W and C helices explains why WRC AD - Rac1 is basally activated ( Fig . 1C , F ) . In addition 342 to the release of the C - terminal half of the meander sequence and WCA , the a 2 helix of 343 WAVE1 in the N - terminal half of the meander sequence partially unfolds and collapses 344 towards where the W helix is originally located ( Fig . 4B ) . Since a 2 interacts with the W 345 helix , which contributes to the sequestering of WCA , we believe the unfolding of a 2 is a 346 result of WCA release , leading to loss of support for the a 2 conformation . 347 Without a direct interaction , how does Rac1 binding to the A site allosterically 348 release the meander sequence or WCA ? Among the A - site elements that undergo rotations , 349 H1b1 and L2 ( a . a . 87 - 114 ) directly associate with the a 4 - loop - a 5 component ( a . a . 132 - 350 152 ) of the meander sequence in WAVE1 through a largely hydrophobic surface of ~ 686 351 Å 2 ( Fig . 4B and Extended Data Fig . 8C - E ) . The rotation of H1b1 and L2 would 352 simultaneously push a 4 - loop - a 5 to rotate around the pivot axis , which aligns to a critical 353 region of the meander sequence near residues P131 and Y151 ( Fig . 4B and Extended Data 354 Fig . 8B , C ) . At this region , Y151 inserts into a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by highly 355 conserved residues from both Sra1 and WAVE1 , analogous to a key being inserted into a 356 lock ( Fig . 4C , top ) . Based on this analogy , we herein refer to this region as the “Tyrosine 357 lock” . Half of the Tyrosine lock is contributed by Sra1 , including W86 / R87 / S88 / C89 from 358 Ding et al 17 the L2 loop and F686 from the H8a helix , while the other half comes from WAVE1 , 359 including P131 / P132 / P133 / L134 preceding a 4 and L148 in a 5 ( Fig . 4C ) . In particular , 360 P131 / P132 / P133 ( or PPP ) forms a rigid stereotypical left - handed polyproline II helix ( PPII 361 helix ) that lines up the binding pocket ( Fig . 4C ) . Rotating one side of the Tyrosine lock 362 ( including S88 , C89 in Sra1 and the rigid PPII helix in WAVE1 ) , while keeping the other 363 side stationary ( including W67 , R87 , and F686 in Sra1 ) , would pinch the Tyrosine lock 364 and destabilize the binding of Y151 ( Extended Data Movie 1 ) . 365 The sequence immediately following Y151 ( a . a . 151 - 161 , herein referred to as the 366 “stem” ) forms a series of highly conserved interactions with Sra1 and the C helix 8 ( Fig . 367 4D ) , which are critical for keeping the meander sequence and WCA sequestered . Many 368 missense mutations , either identified in Cyfip2 from human patients or previously designed 369 based on the crystal structure ( WRC xtal ; PDB : 3P8C ) to disrupt WRC autoinhibition , are 370 located in the Tyrosine lock region and the “stem” regions ( Fig . 4D , indicated by red and 371 yellow dots , respectively ) 8 , 27 , 29 , 30 . Single point mutation in these regions was typically 372 sufficient to cause disease or autoactivation of WRC , suggesting the interactions in the 373 Tyrosine lock and the “stem” region are highly cooperative 8 , 21 , 28 . Releasing Y151 from the 374 Tyrosine lock would disrupt the overall conformation of the “stem” sequence , subsequently 375 leading to WCA release and WRC activation . 376 The above analysis suggests Rac1 binding to the A site acts as an allosteric 377 competitor of Y151 in the Tyrosine lock . Given this model , if we disrupt the Tyrosine lock , 378 we should see enhanced Rac1 binding to the A site . To test this model , we designed three 379 separate mutations to disrupt the Tyrosine lock from different angles and then used GST - 380 Rac1 to pull down various WRC D - Rac1 that carry these mutations . Note in WRC D - Rac1 the D 381 Ding et al 18 site is occupied by Rac1 , which allows us to specifically measure Rac1 binding to the A 382 site . The first mutation , ∆PPP , replaces the rigid PPII helix on the WAVE1 side of the 383 Tyrosine lock with a flexible peptide linker . The second mutation is a phosphomimetic 384 mutation , Y151E , in WAVE1 . Y151 is strictly conserved from animals to plants and is 385 known to be phosphorylated by the Abl kinase in cells to promote WRC - mediated actin 386 polymerization and lamellipodia formation 31 – 33 . In a previous study , Y151E ( or Y150D in 387 WAVE2 ) or a mutation disrupting the binding pocket ( F686E ) , was shown to activate the 388 WRC both in vitro and in cells 8 . The third mutation is R87C in Sra1 , which is a hotspot 389 mutation in Cyfip2 in human patients with DEE - 65 and was shown to activate WRC in 390 cells 27 – 29 . R87C should disrupt the Tyrosine lock from the Sra1 side ( Fig . 4C ) . As expected , 391 the wild type ( WT ) WRC D - Rac1 showed marginal binding to GST - Rac1 due to the low 392 affinity of Rac1 to the A site in inhibited WRC . By contrast , all the above three mutations 393 significantly promoted the binding ( Fig . 5A - B ) and caused autoactivation of WRC in 394 pyrene - actin polymerization assays ( Fig . 5C ) . 395 Together , our analysis explains how Rac1 binding to the A site promotes WRC 396 activation through an allosteric competition mechanism . This mechanism is analogous to 397 a “door wedge” model ( Fig . 5D and Extended Data Movie 1 ) . In the basal state , the wedge 398 ( Y151 ) is inserted in the door hinge ( Tyrosine lock ) to stabilize the closed conformation . 399 To activate WRC , Rac1 binding must push the door ( the A site together with a 4 - loop - a 5 400 of WAVE1 ) to swing around the hinge , which will pinch out the wedge , leading to the 401 collective release of the attached “stem” region and WCA . The “tug of war” between the 402 wedge and Rac1 binding determines the equilibrium between the closed and open 403 conformations of the WRC and hence its activity level , while further phosphorylation of 404 Ding et al 19 Y151 by Abl can act synergistically with Rac1 to shift the equilibrium ( more details in 405 Discussion ) . 406 407 Discussion 408 Signaling from Rac1 GTPase to the WRC and Arp2 / 3 plays a central role in 409 promoting actin cytoskeletal assembly in various important processes 2 , 4 , 12 , 18 . Nevertheless , 410 how Rac1 binds to and activates WRC has remained a major conundrum for the last two 411 decades . Here , our structural , biochemical , and cellular analyses have resolved this central 412 mechanism , revealing precisely how Rac1 binds to both A and D sites through two distinct 413 surfaces and how Rac1 binding to the A site stimulates WRC activation . Distinct from two 414 other members of the WASP - family protein , WASP and N - WASP , in which the Rho - 415 GTPase Cdc42 releases the inhibited WCA through a direct competition mechanism 3 , 416 WAVE in the WRC is activated by an allosteric competition mechanism analogous to a 417 “door wedge” model , in which Rac1 binding to the A site drives conformational changes 418 that propagate to the Tyrosine lock region to destabilize meander binding and release WCA 419 ( Fig . 5D and Extended Data Movie 1 ) . 420 Among the many ligands of the WRC , Rac GTPases are the ubiquitous activator 18 . 421 Determining the activation mechanism by Rac1 gives insights into how other WRC ligands , 422 such as inositol phospholipids , kinases , Arf GTPases , and membrane receptors , may work 423 together with Rac to spatiotemporally control WRC activity in diverse processes 18 . For 424 example , phosphorylation of WAVE2 Y150 and WAVE3 Y151 ( equivalent to WAVE1 Y151 ) by 425 the Abl kinase promotes WRC - mediated actin polymerization and lamellipodia 426 formation 31 – 33 . Our data reveal that Abl and Rac1 utilize the same mechanism to promote 427 Ding et al 20 WRC activation . Y151 is entirely buried in the Tyrosine lock in the basal state and only 428 becomes accessible to Abl kinases when the A site Rac1 releases it . Once phosphorylated , 429 Y151 can no longer antagonize Rac1 binding . Instead , the phosphorylated Y151 will 430 sustain WRC activation until it is reversed by a phosphatase ( Fig . 5D ) . The crosstalk 431 between phosphorylation , dephosphorylation , and Rac1 binding can provide an intricate 432 mechanism for cells to control both the strength and duration of WRC activation . A similar 433 mechanism was previously proposed for WASP and N - WASP 34 . 434 The structural model also depicts how WRC can be possibly oriented on 435 membranes to interact with other molecules . WRC has an acidic and a basic surface 436 ( Extended Data Fig . 4B ) . When binding to two Rac1 molecules , WRC can readily 437 associate with acidic phospholipids on the membrane through the basic side . This 438 orientation allows both Rac1 molecules to be anchored to the lipid bilayer through their 439 prenylated basic tails , while the WCA can be readily released towards Arp2 / 3 in the 440 cytoplasm . It is known that acidic phospholipids , such as PIP 3 , cooperate with Rac1 to 441 activate WRC 14 . The synergy could be achieved by increasing membrane recruitment of 442 the WRC and / or simultaneously stabilizing a conformation compatible with Rac1 binding 443 ( such as capturing the released , positively charged a 6 helix of the meander region ) . 444 In addition , other membrane - associated proteins are thought to cooperate with Rac1 445 to promote WRC activity , including many proteins that contain a short peptide motif named 446 WIRS ( WRC interacting receptor sequence ) 12 and the Arf1 GTPase 11 . While the WIRS 447 peptide does not activate WRC , sequences flanking the WIRS motif were shown to 448 modulate WRC activity 12 . It is possible that these sequences act through secondary , weak 449 interactions with structural elements important for Rac1 - mediated activation , including the 450 Ding et al 21 A site , the meander sequence , and the Tyrosine lock . Knowing how Rac1 activates the 451 WRC will help dissecting the contributions of other WRC ligands ( e . g . , Arf1 GTPase and 452 various membrane receptors ) . 453 Our data also shed light on how various disease - related mutations influence WRC 454 activation . Many missense mutations that cause the neurodevelopmental disorder DEE - 65 455 are clustered around the A site and the Tyrosine lock region ( Fig . 4E ) , which was 456 previously named the “ Cyfip2 hotspot # 1” 18 . Our data suggest all known mutations in this 457 region increase WRC activity , either by destabilizing the Tyrosine lock or the “stem” 458 region ( such as R87C ) , or by promoting Rac1 binding ( such as Y108H ) . It is remarkable 459 that Y108H only mildly increases the sensitivity of the WRC for Rac1 , underscoring the 460 importance of precisely controlling WRC activity in the cell . Our structure also reveals 461 how the melanoma - causing mutation , Rac1 P29S , enhances WRC activation by facilitating 462 its binding to the A site . Together , these data emphasize the need of developing inhibitors 463 that can target Rac1 - mediated WRC activation for the treatment of related diseases . 464 Our data clearly support that D site Rac1 binding does not directly activate WRC . 465 We posit that the D site Rac1 binding has at least two major functions . First , the D site can 466 facilitate membrane recruitment of the WRC due to its high affinity . Second , D site Rac1 467 binding may enhance A site Rac1 binding . Several pieces of evidence support this notion . 468 First , the previously measured binding isotherms of GST - Rac1 binding to the WRC 469 suggested cooperativity between A and D sites 19 . Second , mutating the D site was shown 470 to abolish WRC activation in pyrene - actin assembly assays 19 —it is possible that without 471 D site Rac1 binding , A site affinity is too low to show activation in these assay conditions . 472 This is consistent with our new results , showing that while the WRC with Rac1 tethered to 473 Ding et al 22 the A site is basally active , the activity can be further promoted by D site Rac1 binding 474 ( Extended Data Fig . 3D ) . 475 Lastly , the WRC AD - Rac1 structure clearly reveals the similarities and differences 476 between Rac1 binding to the A site of Sra1 and the recently discovered Rac1 inhibitor , 477 CYRI - B 24 , 26 . CYRI - B and the A site region ( designated as the DUF1394 domain ) share 478 little homology in sequence ( 21 % identity ) 25 , but high similarity in structure ( 3 . 7 Å 479 r . m . s . d . ) ( Extended Data Fig . 6P - S ) . Our structure reveals that Rac1 has a similar 480 orientation in binding to both Sra1 A site and CYRI - B surfaces , which are both positively 481 charged ( Fig . 3B vs . Extended Data Fig . 6Q ) . Nevertheless , except for a few conserved 482 residues sharing a similar mechanism to bind Rac1 , including the Arginine ( Sra1 R190 vs . 483 CYRI - B R161 ) anchoring into the negatively charged pocket on Rac1 ( Fig . 3C vs . Extended 484 Data Fig . 6S ) , most other interactions are largely different , with the Sra1 A site involving 485 more extensive interactions . 486 In summary , our work delineates the binding and activation mechanism of WRC 487 by Rac1 GTPase . It clearly demonstrates that Rac1’s engagement to the A site and not just 488 to the D site leads to activation of WRC and suggests possible cooperativity between the 489 two sites . The later needs to be clearly established by future studies . Besides providing a 490 structural perspective for several disease mutations , this study provides a mechanistic 491 foundation for understanding how small GTPases can trigger the activation of WRC and 492 regulate the WRC - Arp2 / 3 - actin signaling axis . 493 Ding et al 23 494 Figure 1 .

WRC230WCA contains human full - length Sra1 , full - 661 length Nap1 , WAVE1 ( 1 - 230 ) - ( GGS ) 6 - WCA ( 485 - 559 ) , Abi2 ( 1 - 158 ) , and full - length 662 HSPC300 . Other WRCs contain modified subunits ( see Table S1 , S2 for detailed protein 663 sequences and WRC compositions ) . Briefly , WRC D - Rac1 was created by tethering 664 Rac1 Q61L / P29S ( 1 - 188 ) to the C - terminus of Sra1 using a ( GGS ) 4 peptide linker . WRC AD - Rac1 665 was created from WRC D - Rac1 P29S by inserting ( GGS ) 6 - Rac1 Q61L / P29S ( 1 - 188 ) - ( GS ) 6 between 666 Y423 and S424 of Sra1 . WRC D - Rac1 / ∆PPP was made from WRC D - Rac1 by replacing 667 137 PPPLNI 230 in WAVE1 with a GSGSGS linker . WRC D - Rac1 / Y151E and WRC D - Rac1 / R87C were 668 made from WRC D - Rac1 by introducing Y151E and R87C to Sra1 , respectively . 669 All WRCs were expressed and purified from the Tni insect cells ( for Sra1 and Nap1 , 670 Expression Systems ) and E . coli ( for WAVE1 , Abi2 , and HSPC300 ) through multiple 671 chromatographic steps , essentially as previously described for WRC230WCA and 672 WRC230∆WCA - Rac1 19 , 36 . A gel filtration step by a 24 - ml Superdex200 ( Cytiva ) was 673 always used as the final , polishing step of purification to exchange buffer and evaluate the 674 purity , assembly , and potential aggregation in each preparation . All WRC constructs 675 appeared to be properly assembled into stable complexes , behaving similarly to 676 WRC230WCA during each step of the reconstitution , showing no noticeable signs of 677 aggregation or misfolding ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . All other proteins were purified using 678 previously established procedures , including GST - Rac1 and untagged Rac1 WT or mutants 679 Ding et al 35 carrying P29S or P29S / Q61L , Arp2 / 3 complex , actin , WAVE1 WCA , TEV protease , and 680 HRV 3C protease 19 . Note Rac1 Q61L / P29S constitutively binds to GTP without noticeable 681 hydrolysis during long - term storage . The bound GTP cannot be exchanged with other 682 nucleotides ( such as GDP ) using standard EDTA - chelating procedures even at 37 °C 683 ( Extended Data Fig . 3E ) . Therefore , all constructs containing Rac1 Q61L / P29S were used as 684 the GTP form without being reloaded to other nucleotides . 685 Nucleotide test of Rac1 GTPases 686 Rac1 QP and Rac1 P29S ( 100 µl , 150 - 200 µM ) were first loaded with GTP or GDP by 687 using previous EDTA - chelating procedures 19 . The proteins were then desalted into the QA 688 buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 ) through a 5 - mL HiTrap Desalting column ( Cytiva ) and 689 then denatured by 5 volumes of 8 M urea for 30 min . The denatured protein samples were 690 filtered through a centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cut - off ( MWCO ) of 10 691 kDa . The collected flow - through , which contained the released nucleotides but not protein , 692 was loaded onto a 1 - mL HiTrap Q column at a flow rate of 1 mL / min and eluted with 25 693 mL of buffer developed along a gradient of 50 - 500 mM KCl . Pure GTP and GDP were 694 injected into the column separately as controls . 695 GST pull - down assay 696 GST pull - down assays were performed as previously described 19 . Briefly , 100 - 200 697 pmol of GST tagged proteins as bait and 100 - 200 pmol of WRCs as prey were mixed with 698 20 μL of Glutathione Sepharose beads ( Cytiva ) in 1 mL of binding buffer containing 10 699 mM HEPES pH 7 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 % ( w / v ) glycerol , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM β - 700 mercaptoethanol at 4 ̊C for 30 min , followed by three washes , each time using 1 mL of the 701 Ding et al 36 binding buffer . Bound proteins were eluted with GST elution buffer ( 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 702 8 . 5 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 30 mM reduced glutathione ) and examined by SDS - PAGE . 703 Pyrene - actin assembly assay 704 Actin polymerization assays were performed as previously described with some 705 modifications 19 . Each reaction ( 120 µL ) contained 3 - 4 µM actin ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) , 10 706 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 100 nM WRC230WCA and its variants or WAVE1 WCA , and 707 desired concentrations of untagged Rac1 Q61L / P29S ( 1 - 188 ) in NMEH20GD buffer ( 50 mM 708 NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES pH7 . 0 , 20 % ( w / v ) glycerol , and 1 mM 709 DTT ) or KMEI20GD buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM Imidazole 710 pH7 . 0 , 20 % ( w / v ) glycerol , and 1 mM DTT ) . We noticed that compared to KMEI20GD 711 buffer , NMEH20GD buffer tended to facilitate ligand - WRC interaction and actin 712 polymerization , which allowed us to reduce protein concentration and reaction time . 713 Pyrene - actin fluorescence was recorded every 5 seconds at 22 °C using a 96 - well flat - 714 bottom black plate ( Greiner Bio - One™ ) in a Spark plate reader ( Tecan ) , with excitation at 715 365 nm and emission at 407 nm ( 15 nm bandwidth for both wavelengths ) . 716 Sample preparation for electron microscopy 717 WRC apo and WRC D - Rac1 samples were diluted into a buffer containing 10 mM 718 HEPES - KOH ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , and 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol to a 719 final concentration of 1 . 2 µM . WRC AD - Rac1 sample was diluted using the same buffer to 720 0 . 4 µM final concentration . 3 . 5 µl of each sample were applied to freshly glow discharged 721 ( using air at 19mA for 120s in Pelco EasiGlow ( Ted Pella ) ) 300 mesh UltrAuFoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 722 holey gold grids ( Quantifoils ) . Grids were manually blotted using Whatman 1 filter paper 723 for ~ 5 s to remove excess sample and immediately plunged into liquid ethane at - 179°C . 724 Ding et al 37 Sample vitrification were carried out using a custom - built manual plunge freezing device , 725 and the entire process was performed in a 4 ℃ cold room with relative humidity maintained 726 between 90 % and 95 % . 727 728 Electron microscopy data acquisition 729 Cryo - EM data were acquired on a 200kV Talos Arctica ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 730 transmission electron microscope . Dose - fractionated movies were collected using a Falcon 731 3EC direct electron detector ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in electron counting mode . For all 732 the three sample datasets , each micrograph comprised of 62 dose - fractionated movie 733 frames acquired over 40 s . Cumulative exposure dose per micrograph are 44 . 06 e - / Å 2 for 734 the WRC apo dataset , 45 . 27 e - / Å 2 for the WRC D - Rac1 dataset , and 41 . 34 e - / Å 2 for the WRC AD - 735 Rac1 dataset . Automated data acquisitions were performed using EPU ( Thermo Fisher 736 Scientific ) , and 2 , 913 micrographs , 2 , 512 micrographs and 1 , 285 micrographs were 737 collected for the WRC apo , WRC D - Rac1 and WRC AD - Rac1 datasets , respectively . All datasets 738 were acquired at a nominal magnification of 120 , 000x corresponding to a physical pixel 739 size of 0 . 8757 Å / pixel . Data were collected with nominal defocus varying between - 0 . 6 740 and - 1 . 2 µm for the WRC apo dataset , between - 0 . 5 and - 1 . 0 µm for the WRC D - Rac1 dataset , 741 and between - 0 . 8 and - 1 . 2 µm for the WRC AD - Rac1 dataset . Due to preferred - orientation of 742 Rac1 bound WRC complexes in vitreous ice , the WRC D - Rac1 and WRC AD - Rac1 datasets had 743 ~ 15 % and ~ 30 % respectively of the micrographs collected by tilting of specimen to 36 ° 744 ( alpha - tilt ) . 745 Electron Microscopy data processing 746 Ding et al 38 For WRC apo dataset , beam induced motion - correction and dose - weighting to 747 compensate for radiation damage over spatial frequencies , were perform using UCSF 748 motioncor2 program 37 implemented in the RELION v3 . 0 . 6 image processing suite 38 . 749 Contrast Transfer Function ( CTF ) parameters were estimated for the motion corrected , 750 dose - weighted summed micrographs using Gctf 39 . 2 , 796 micrographs with estimated 751 defocus values below - 2 . 1 µm , were selected for further processing . 2 , 006 , 821 particles 752 were picked using reference - free Laplacian - of - Gaussian auto - picking program in RELION . 753 These picked particles were extracted with a box size of 424 pixels and binned by a factor 754 of four ( to 106 pixels box , with pixel size of 3 . 5 Å / pixel ) for 2D classification , which was 755 performed using Cryosparc v2 40 . Multiple rounds of 2D classification were performed to 756 remove 2D class averages containing particles which were either aggregates , or false 757 picked features , or did not contain features with well - defined secondary structures , or were 758 significantly off centered . Metadata for the clean stack of 957 , 365 particles selected from 759 Cryosparc 2D classification were converted to the RELION star format using 760 csparc2star . py script ( written by Dr . Daniel Asarnow ) . These particles were then re - 761 extracted after four - fold binning from 512 pixels box ( 0 . 8757 Å / pixel ) to 128 pixels box 762 ( 3 . 5 Å / pixel ) in RELION for faster computation . A D - site Rac1 tethered WRC Cryo - EM 763 map ( EMDB - 6642 ) 19 , which was rescaled and padded to 128 pixels box ( 3 . 5 Å / pixel ) , was 764 used as initial 3D reference map . After one round of 3D refinement , a three - class 3D 765 classification was performed to further sort out heterogeneity . 349 , 065 particles belonging 766 to the best resolved 3D class were selected for further processing . Another round of 3D 767 refinement was performed using these selected particles , and then the resulting particles 768 were re - extracted unbinned after re - centering picked co - ordinates from micrographs , with 769 Ding et al 39 a box size of 512pixels ( 0 . 8757 Å / pixel ) . Multiple 3D refinements ( without and with 770 masks ) were performed with these particles to improve alignments and 3D angular 771 assignments . For accurate per - particle CTF estimation and per - particle motion correction , 772 CTF refinement was performed , followed by Bayesian polishing within RELION v3 . 0 . 7 . 773 This resulted in improvement of resolution of the reconstructed map from 3 . 8 Å to 3 . 0 Å . 774 A three - step CTF refinement was performed in RELION v3 . 1 to further improve the 775 accuracy of CTF parameters and correct for higher - order imaging aberrations . Following 776 this step , 3D refinement further improved the resolution of the map to 2 . 9 Å . To further 777 sort out local structural heterogeneity , a three - class 3D classification without alignment 778 ( clustering ) was performed , and the best resolved class with the intact complex was 779 selected for further processing . 95 , 319 particles from this selected class were refined to a 780 resolution of 3 . 0 Å . Local resolution for the reconstructed map was estimated using 781 RELION v3 . 0 . 7 . This indicated that the core of the WRC apo complex was resolved to ~ 2 . 8 782 Å and the most flexible regions had a resolution close to 4 . 5 Å . 3DFSC server 39 783 ( https : / / 3dfsc . salk . edu ) was used for the estimation of directional Fourier Shell Correlation 784 ( FSC ) . Signal - subtracted focused 3D refinements were performed in RELION v3 . 0 . 7 by 785 dividing the full complex into three slightly overlapping sub - regions . This helped in 786 improving the map quality for the peripheral flexible regions . Focused unsharpened maps 787 and their respective half maps were individually fitted and resampled relative to the full 788 map in UCSF Chimera 41 . Composite half maps were generated from the half maps of the 789 individual focused regions by using the “ vop maximum ” function within UCSF Chimera . 790 The final sharpened composite map for the WRC apo complex was generated from these 791 Ding et al 40 composite half maps by post - processing within RELION . The resulting map was sharpened 792 with a B factor of - 35 Å 2 . 793 For WRC D - Rac1 , the general processing scheme is similar to the one described above 794 for WRC apo . 1 , 765 , 193 particles from 2 , 434 selected micrographs ( based on CTF 795 estimation result ) were extracted with an unbinned box size of 512 pixels , and subsequently 796 binned by a factor of four . Multiple iterations of 2D classification were performed using 797 Cryosparc v2 . 856 , 797 particles from 2D classes with well - defined secondary structures 798 were selected and were imported into RELION . These particles were re - extracted with an 799 unbinned box of 512 pixels and further binned by a factor of four . The resulting particles 800 were subjected to a 3 - classes 3D classification . 218 , 612 particles from the best 3D class 801 were selected and then re - extracted unbinned with recentering of picked coordinates , with 802 a box size of 512 pixels . Multiple rounds of 3D refinement were performed both prior and 803 after CTF refinement and Bayesian Polishing , leading to a reconstructed map with a 804 resolution at 3 . 1 Å ( at 0 . 143 FSC ) . 3D clustering ( classification without particle 805 realignment ) was performed with these particles for further sorting out local heterogeneity 806 and any mis - aligned particles . 87 , 810 particles were selected for subsequent 3D 807 refinements from the best 3D class . The final reconstructed WRC D - Rac1 map was at 3 . 0 Å 808 ( at 0 . 143 FSC ) resolution . Local resolution for the reconstructed map was estimated using 809 RELION v3 . 0 . 7 . The result indicated that the core of the WRC D - Rac1 complex was resolved 810 to ~ 2 . 8 Å and the most flexible regions had a resolution close to 4 . 5 Å . 3DFSC server 811 ( https : / / 3dfsc . salk . edu ) was used for estimation of directional Fourier Shell Correlation 812 ( FSC ) . To improve the map quality for peripheral flexible regions of the complex , focused 813 3D refinement with signal - subtraction were performed as described for WRC apo data 814 Ding et al 41 processing . The focused maps were then used to generate the composite map . The final 815 map was sharpened with a B factor of - 39 Å 2 . 816 For WRC AD - Rac1 dataset , complete image processing was performed using 817 Cryosparc v2 . To correct for beam - induced motion , full - frame motion correction followed 818 by patch motion corrections were performed . CTF parameters for these micrographs were 819 estimated using Patch CTF estimation program was used to accurately estimate local CTF 820 parameters . Twenty two micrographs were removed due to poor CTF fitting , and 1 , 263 821 micrographs were kept for subsequent processing . Template - free Gaussian blob picker was 822 used to pick 666 , 417 particles from these micrographs . Picked particles were extracted 823 unbinned with a box size of 512 pixels , and then binned by a factor of four . One round of 824 2D classification was performed to remove particles from 2D classes that did not represent 825 intact complex , aggregated , or had non - particle features . 657 , 065 particles from the 826 selected 2D classes were subjected to heterogenous refinement with 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 classes 827 in Cryosparc . 227 , 361 particles from the best 3D classes were re - extracted unbinned with 828 a box size of 512 pixels . The resulting stack of particles were subjected to homogeneous 829 refinement , and the resulting reconstruction reached 3 . 2 Å resolution . To accurately correct 830 for local beam induced motion and per - particle CTF estimation , the selected particles were 831 subjected to local motion correction followed by global and local CTF refinement . One 832 round of homogeneous refinement with the optimized particle set yielded a 3D 833 reconstruction at a resolution of 3 . 0 Å . A three - class ab - initio reconstruction was used to 834 further fish - out the best particles that are representative of the full complex . 139 , 296 835 particles belonging to the best resolved class from the ab - initio reconstruction were then 836 subjected to final 3D reconstruction ( one - class heterogeneous refinement ) which reached 837 Ding et al 42 3 . 0 Å resolution . Local resolution for the reconstructed map was estimated using Cryosparc 838 v2 , and showed the core of the WRCA AD - Rac1 complex was resolved to ~ 2 . 5 Å and the most 839 flexible region had a resolution close to 4 . 5 Å . 3DFSC server ( https : / / 3dfsc . salk . edu ) was 840 used for estimation of directional Fourier Shell Correlation ( FSC ) . To improve the map 841 quality of various flexible regions , local 3D refinements with masks applied on specific 842 regions were performed . The resulting focused maps were then stitched as described before 843 to generate the final map . The final map was sharpened with a B factor of - 59 Å 2 . 844 Atomic model building 845 Crystal structure of WRC ( WRC xtal ) ( PDB 3P8C ) , and Rac1 ( PDB 3SBD ) were 846 used as initial models . These models were rigid - body docked into the corresponding 847 regions in the reconstructed maps of WRC apo , WRC D - Rac1 and WRC AD - Rac1 using UCSF 848 Chimera . Flexible fitting of the docked models into the maps were performed using 849 Namdinator 42 ( https : / / namdinator . au . dk ) , and generated composite initial model for each 850 complex . The missing portions in the fitted models were manually built using COOT 42 . 851 Mutation of residues in the Rac1 molecules and bound nucleotides or nucleotide analogues 852 and divalent cations were manually edited in COOT . These models were then subjected to 853 repeated iterations of real - space refinement in Phenix 43 to fix geometry outliers and clash 854 issues . Manual editing of the model in COOT further improved model accuracy . The 855 atomic models were validated using the Molprobity server 44 856 ( http : / / moprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ) as well as the PDB Validation server 45 857 ( www . wwpdb . org ) . 858 Cell culture and co - immunoprecipitation 859 Ding et al 43 B16 - F1 - derived Sra1 / Cyfip2 KO cells ( clone # 3 ) were previously described 21 , and 860 maintained in DMEM ( 4 . 5 g / l glucose ; Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Gibco ) , 861 2 mM glutamine ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and penicillin ( 50 Units / ml ) / streptomycin ( 50 862 µg / ml ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Cells were routinely transfected in 6 well plates 863 ( Sarstedt ) , using 1 µg DNA in total and 2 µl JetPrime per well . 864 pEGFP - C2 - Sra1 ( CYFIP1 ) and derived C179R and Y108H mutant constructs were 865 described previously 21 , 28 and correspond to the splice variant CYFIP1a , sequence AJ567911 , 866 of murine origin . Various point mutations in the A site were introduced by site - directed 867 mutagenesis . The identity of all DNA constructs was verified by sequencing . 868 For EGFP - immunoprecipitation experiments , B16 - F1 - derived cell lines ectopically 869 expressing EGFP - tagged variants of Sra1 were lysed with lysis buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 870 140 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris / HCl pH 7 . 4 / 50 mM NaF , 10 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 871 Complete Mini , EDTA - free protease inhibitor [ Roche ] ) . Lysates were cleared and incubated 872 with GFP - Trap agarose beads ( Chromotek ) for 60 min . Subsequently , beads were washed 873 three times with lysis buffer lacking protease inhibitor and Triton X - 100 , mixed with SDS - 874 PAGE loading buffer , boiled for 5 min , and examined by Western Blotting using primary 875 antibodies against CYFIP1 / 2 ( Sra - 1 / PIR121 ) 46 , Nap1 46 , and WAVE 21 , and corresponding 876 HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . Chemiluminescence signals were 877 obtained upon incubation with ECL™ Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent ( Cytiva ) , 878 and recorded with ECL Chemocam imager ( Intas , Goettingen , Germany ) . 879 Fluorescence microscopy , phalloidin staining , and quantification 880 B16 - F1 - derived cell lines expressing indicated EGFP - tagged CYFIP1 constructs or 881 untransfected control cells were seeded onto laminin - coated ( 25 µg / ml ) , 15 mm - diameter 882 Ding et al 44 glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for about 24 hours prior to fixation . Cells were fixed 883 with pre - warmed , 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 20 min , and permeabilized with 884 0 . 05 % Triton - X100 in PBS for 30 sec . The actin cytoskeleton was subsequently stained using 885 ATTO - 594 - conjugated phalloidin ( ATTO TEC GmbH , Germany ) . Samples were mounted 886 using VectaShield Vibrance antifade reagent and imaged using a ×63 / 1 . 4NA Plan 887 apochromatic oil objective . 888 For assessment of lamellipodia formation , cells were randomly selected and 889 categorized in a blinded manner as follows : “no lamellipodia” if no phalloidin - stained 890 peripheral lamellipodia - like actin meshwork was visible , “immature lamellipodia” if the 891 lamellipodia - like actin meshwork was small , narrow , or displayed multiple ruffles , and 892 “lamellipodia” if the lamellipodia - like actin meshwork appeared to be fully developed 21 . 893 Statistical analysis 894 To assess statistical significance , one - way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post - hoc test was 895 applied to compare multiple groups with one control group . Statistical analyses were 896 performed using Prism 6 . 01 . An error probability below 5 % ( p < 0 . 05 ; * in Figure panels ) 897 was considered to indicate statistical significance . * * and * * * indicated p - values ≤ 0 . 01 and 898 ≤ 0 . 001 , respectively . 899 Data and materials availability 900 Cryo - EM reconstructed maps for WRC apo , WRC D - Rac1 and WRC AD - Rac1 were deposited in 901 the Electron Microscopy Data Bank under accession IDs EMD - 26732 , EMD - 26733 , and 902 EMD - 26734 respectively , and corresponding atomic models were deposited in the Protein 903 Data Bank with accession IDs 7USC , 7USD , and 7USE respectively . 904 905 Ding et al 45 Acknowledgements 906 Electron Microscopy data were collected at the Stony Brook University Cryo - EM center , 907 which is supported by the National Institutes of Health ( S10 OD012272 ) .

( A ) Structural 938 overlay of WRC apo ( color ) and WRC xtal ( grey , PDB : 3P8C ) , showing high similarity 939 between the two structures , with the whole complex r . m . s . d . = 0 . 827 Å as calculated in 940 Pymol . ( B ) Side - by - side comparison of WRC apo and WRC xtal showing the difference in the 941 Ding et al 54 assigned position of the a A helix . In WRC xtal structure , this helix was assigned to a 942 neighboring WRC in the crystal lattice , which raised the hypothesis that this helix might 943 promote WRC clustering or oligomerization at membranes . By contrast , the single particle 944 cryo - EM structure of WRC apo reveals the helix belongs to the same WRC . ( C ) Density for 945 the a A helix and L1 loop ( a . a . 27 - 56 ) in Sra1 . The weak density of the L1 loop following 946 the C - terminus of a A suggests L1 must wind through an internal cavity in WRC to connect 947 to the N - terminus of the H1a helix . This buried loop should restrain a A from approaching 948 another WRC , unless the complex is first disassembled . The missing density of the C - 949 terminal half of the L1 loop is indicated by a dashed line connecting to the N - terminus of 950 the H1a helix . ( D ) A representative cryo - EM micrograph of vitrified WRC apo sample . Scale 951 bar : 20 nm . ( E ) Representative 2D class averages of WRC apo . Scale bar : 20 nm . ( F ) Plot 952 showing the Euler angle distribution assigned to the particles contributing to the final 953 reconstructed map of WRC apo . The height of each cylinder corresponds to the number of 954 particles in each angular orientation . ( G ) Maps of WRC apo colored based on local resolution 955 values and showing two views that are rotated 180° along y - axis . ( H ) Directional Fourier 956 Shell Correlation ( FSC ) plot representing 3D resolution anisotropy in the cryo - EM map of 957 WRC apo . The blue histograms represent percentage of directional resolution over the spatial 958 frequency ; the red line indicates the global FSC ; the green dashed lines correspond to ±1 959 standard deviation from mean of directional resolutions ; and the grey dashed line shows 960 FSC at the cut - off value 0 . 143 . ( I ) Schematic showing cryo - EM data processing steps for 961 obtaining 3D reconstruction of WRC apo complex dataset . ~ 2 million particles went through 962 multiple iterations of 2D classification and one round of 3D classification to clean up the 963 particle stack . 3D clustering helped to further sort out heterogeneity existing in the data set . 964 Ding et al 55 This clean stack of particles was subject to 3D auto - refinement and signal - subtracted 965 focused refinement . The focused maps were combined to generate the final composite map . 966 967 Ding et al 56 968 Extended Data Fig . 2 Cryo - EM structure determination of WRC D - Rac1 . ( A - B ) Cartoon 969 and structural representations to show the previous and new strategies of stabilizing Rac1 970 binding to the D site . Dotted lines and arrow heads indicate flexible ( GGS ) or ( GS ) linkers 971 ( see Table S1 , S2 for linker details ) . ( C ) Density for Rac1 tethered to the D site , showing 972 no observable density accountable for the flexible linker used for tethering ( indicated by 973 Ding et al 57 dotted line ) . The WRC D - Rac1 structure is overlaid on WRC apo ( pale color ) , showing the local 974 structures surrounding the tethering points were not perturbed . ( D ) A representative cryo - 975 EM micrograph of vitrified WRC D - Rac1 sample . Scale bar : 20 nm . ( E ) Representative 2D 976 class averages of WRC D - Rac1 . Scale bar : 20 nm . ( F ) Plot showing the Euler angle 977 distribution of particles that contributed to final reconstruction of WRC D - Rac1 . The height 978 of each cylinder corresponds to the number of particles in each angular orientation . ( G ) 979 Maps of WRC D - Rac1 colored based on local resolution values and showing two views 980 rotated by 180° along y - axis . ( H ) Directional Fourier Shell Correlation ( FSC ) plot 981 representing 3D resolution anisotropy in the cryo - EM map of WRC D - Rac1 . The blue 982 histograms represent percentage of directional resolution over the spatial frequency ; the 983 red line indicates the global FSC ; the green dashed lines correspond to ±1 standard 984 deviation from mean of directional resolutions ; and the grey dashed line shows FSC at the 985 cut - off value 0 . 143 . ( I ) A schematic of the different data processing steps of WRC D - Rac1 986 complex dataset , which is similar to that of WRC apo . 987 988 Ding et al 58 989 Extended Data Fig . 3 Cryo - EM structure determination of WRC AD - Rac1 . ( A - B ) 990 Cartoon and structural representation of the new strategies to stabilize Rac1 binding to the 991 A site . Dotted lines and arrow heads indicate flexible ( GGS ) or ( GS ) linkers ( see Table S1 , 992 S2 for linker details ) . Four non - conserved surface loops in Sra1 ( red , Loop1 : a . a . 95 - 103 ; 993 Ding et al 59 Loop2 : a . a . 276 - 281 ; Loop3 : a . a . 329 - 342 ; Loop4 : a . a . 418 - 432 ) surrounding the A site 994 were chosen to insert Rac1 using two separate flexible linkers . Insertion at Loop4 between 995 Y423 and S424 produced the high - resolution cryo - EM structure of WRC AD - Rac1 . ( B ) 996 Secondary structure assignment of Sra1 , following the same scheme used in the crystal 997 structure of the WRC 8 . DUF1394 domain and Rac1 at both A and D site are indicated . ( C ) 998 Density for Rac1 tethered to the A site , showing very weak , if any , density could be 999 observed for the flexible linkers used for the tethering ( indicated by dotted lines ) . The 1000 WRC AD - Rac1 structure is overlaid on WRC apo ( pale color ) , showing the local structures 1001 surrounding the tethering points were not disturbed , except that no density was observed 1002 for a . a . 422 - 427 , which is the tip of Loop4 where Rac1 is inserted between a . a . 423 and 1003 424 . ( D ) Pyrene - actin polymerization assay showing tethering Rac1 to the A site was 1004 sufficient to promote WRC activation in a nucleotide dependent manner , and this activity 1005 was further promoted by Rac1 binding to the D site . The green curves show WRC A - Rac1 , in 1006 which Rac1 only contained the P29S mutation , instead of both P29S and Q61L . Unlike 1007 Rac1 QP , Rac1 P29S can be loaded with GMPPNP or GDP , as is shown in ( E ) . The orange 1008 curves compare the activities of WRC AD - Rac1 , in which the D - site Rac1 P29S was loaded with 1009 indicated nucleotides , while the A - site Rac1 QP remained bound to GTP . Reactions use the 1010 KMEI20GD buffer ( see Methods ) and contain 4 µM actin ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) , 10 nM 1011 Arp2 / 3 complex , 100 nM WRC230WCA or WAVE1 WCA . ( E ) Ion exchange 1012 chromatography to identify the nucleotide bound to Rac1 after the loading procedures ( see 1013 Methods for details ) , showing Rac1 P29S can be loaded with GTP ( or GMPPNP ) and GDP , 1014 while Rac1 QP stays bound to GTP after the same treatment .
