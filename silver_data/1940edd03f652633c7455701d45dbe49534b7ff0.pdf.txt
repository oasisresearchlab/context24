Here , we show that the clathrin heavy chain ( CLTC ) , involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , is vital for maintainingmouse ESC ( mESC ) pluripotency . Knockdown of Cltc resulted in a loss of pluripotency accom - panied by reduced E - cadherin ( E - CAD ) levels and increased levels of transforming growth factor b ( TGF - b ) and extracellular signal - regu - lated kinase ( ERK ) signaling . We demonstrate that both E - CAD and TGF - b receptor type 1 ( TGF - b R1 ) are internalized through CME in mESCs . While E - CAD is recycled , TGF - b R1 is targeted for lysosomal degradation thus maintaining inverse levels of these molecules . Finally , we show that E - CAD interacts with ERK , and that the decreased pluripotency upon CME loss can be rescued by inhibiting TGF - b R , MEK , and GSK3 b , or overexpressing E - CAD . Our results demonstrate that CME is critical for balancing signaling outputs to regulate ESC pluripotency , and possibly cell fate choices in early development . INTRODUCTION Mammalian development is an exquisitely controlled pro - cess involving the concerted action of numerous signaling pathways and cellular processes . Embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) isolated from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst represent a wonderful model system to follow develop - mental decisions and cell fate transitions in vitro ( Evans , 2011 ; Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ; Martin , 1981 ) . Recent re - ports have demonstrated that endocytosis plays a role in regulating the acquisition , as well as the maintenance of the pluripotent state ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ; Li et al . , 2010 ; Mote et al . , 2017 ; Qin et al . , 2014 ; Subramanyam et al . , 2011 ) . Endocytosis is a fundamental eukaryotic pro - cess , wherein membrane - bound proteins are trafﬁcked to different compartments of the cell depending on their function , with the help of small GTPases called RABs ( Doh - erty and McMahon , 2009 ; Traub , 2009 ) . Endocytosis is known to play a role in cell fate speciﬁca - tion during early metazoan development ( De Renzis et al . , 2006 ; Fabrowski et al . , 2013 ; Kawamura et al . , 2012 ; Song et al . , 2013 ) . However , the exact mechanistic role played by endocytosis in the regulation of early mammalian devel - opment remains to be elucidated . To this end , we undertook a small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) screen in mouse ESCs ( mESCs ) , wherein transcripts encod - ingforendocyticcomponentsweredepleted , andtheplurip - otency of ESCs was assessed . We found that knocking down clathrin heavy chain ( Cltc ) , a major coat protein required for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , resulted in a decrease inmESC pluripotency . Further , we show thatCME regulated mESC pluripotency by trafﬁcking two opposing molecular players , namely E - cadherin ( E - CAD or CDH1 ) and trans - forming growth factor b receptor type 1 ( TGF - b R1 ) . In mESCs , E - CAD is recycled back to the membrane after inter - nalization , while TGF - b R1 is targeted to the lysosome for degradation . We further discovered a novel interaction be - tween E - CAD and extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) in mESCs , and found that loss of CME resulted in elevated ERK signaling . b - CATENIN levels were also reduced upon loss of CME . A decrease in CME thus caused an imbal - ance between key signaling pathways , resulting in a loss of pluripotency . Our results demonstrate that trafﬁcking of moleculesviaendocytosisisrequiredtomaintaintheplurip - otent state and identity of mESCs , and that a change in endocytic thresholds may facilitate cell fate transitions . RESULTS Clathrin Heavy Chain Is an Essential Molecule for Maintaining the Pluripotency of mESCs While the contribution of endocytosis to the state of pluripotency has been minimally described over the last few years ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ; Li et al . , 2010 ; Mote et al . , 2017 ; Qin et al . , 2014 ; Subramanyam et al . , 2011 ) , a systematic study looking at speciﬁc endocytic ele - ments that are intimately involved in the maintenance of ESC pluripotency is lacking . We undertook an unbiased , small - scale siRNA - based screen , targeting 112 different 152 Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 12 j 152 – 164 j January 8 , 2019 j ª 2018 The Authors .

Efﬁciency of individual pools of siRNA was not determined . Levels of alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) activity , a marker of ESC plurip - otency ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) , was used as a readout based on the analysis described in the Experimental Procedures . High - throughput screening based on detection of AP was performed 4 days after transfection of siRNAs into mESCs . Knockdown of ﬁve genes resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in AP staining ( shown as red bars ) , while knockdown of two genes resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in AP staining ( shown in blue ) ( Figure 1A ) . We were speciﬁcally interested in understanding the role of endocytic genes in the main - tenance of pluripotency , and hence focused on genes whose knockdown resulted in a loss of AP staining . One such gene was the clathrin heavy chain ( Cltc ) ( Figure 1A ) . Cltc encodesfortheheavychainofclathrin , whichisanin - tegral component of the clathrin triskelion , which forms the clathrin coat during CME ( Kirchhausen et al . , 2014 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . The clathrin coat stabilizes endocytic structures through polymerization at the sites of endocytosis ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ; Tebar et al . , 1996 ) , fol - lowed by scission of the clathrin - coated pit with the help of the small GTPase , Dynamin ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . We validated the screen results by generating indepen - dent endoribonuclease - prepared siRNAs ( esiRNAs ) ( Kittler Figure 1 .

Knock - down of Cltc resulted in a decrease in the uptake of labeled transferrin ( a well - studied cargo for CME ) ( Kirchhausen et al . , 2014 ) into mESCs , indicative of a block of CME ( Fig - ures S1B and S1C ) . As previously reported , transferrin uptake was also signiﬁcantly reduced upon introduction of the dominant negative mutant of Dynamin , K44A Dnm ( Bitoun et al . , 2009 ; Herskovits et al . , 1993 ) , in mESCs ( Figures S1D and S1E ) . We found that blocking CME in mESCs through either the knockdown of Cltc , or upon overexpression of K44A Dnm , resulted in a decrease in AP staining ( Figure 1B ) , colony - forming ability ( Figure 1C ) , a reduction in the proliferation rate ( Figure 1D ) , and an altered cell - cycle proﬁle with increased number of cells in G1 ( Figure 1F ) . However , changes in the proliferation , or cell - cycle proﬁle were not observed in terminally differen - tiated mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) upon blocking CME ( Figures 1E and 1F ) . Reduced CME resulted in a signif - icant decrease in the expression of pluripotency markers ( Figures 1G , S1F , and S1H ) , and an increase in the expres - sion of differentiation markers corresponding to all three germ layers ( Figures 1H , S1G , and S1I ) . However , no induc - tion of apoptosis was observed upon blocking CME ( Fig - ure S1J ) . Teratomas generated from Cltc knockdown cells were smaller compared with those generated from wild - type cells ( Figure S1K ) , while containing structures corre - sponding to all three germ layers ( Figure S1L ) . However , teratomas generated from Cltc knockdown mESCs dis - played excessive hemorrhage , and appeared to have a greater bias toward mesodermal differentiation ( Fig - ure S1L ) . Our results thus demonstrate that CME plays an important role in maintaining the pluripotent state of mESCs . Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis of E - CAD Maintains mESC Pluripotency Interestingly , the knockdown of Cltc , or the introduction of K44A Dnm in mESCs , resulted in a striking phenotype , with cells showing a dispersed and ﬂattened morphology and loss of cell - cell contacts , reminiscent of the phenotype of ESCs lacking E - cad ( Redmer et al . , 2011 ) ( Figures 1B and S2 ) . These morphological features are different from normal mESCs , which grow in tight , three - dimensional , domed colonies that are AP positive ( Figure 1B ) . Indeed , we found that E - CAD levels were decreased upon blocking CME in mESCs ( Figures 2A , S3A , S3B , S4A , and S4B ) . In addition , E - CAD levels were also depleted from the plasma membrane under Cltc knockdown conditions ( Figure S3B ) . The transmembrane , Ca 2 + - dependent protein , E - CAD , is known to act by maintaining cell contacts through the for - mation of adherens junctions ( Leckband and de Rooij , 2014 ) . It is involved in maintenance of the pluripotent state of mESCs ( Redmer et al . , 2011 ) , and is required for normal mammalian development ( Larue et al . , 1994 ; Ste - phenson et al . , 2010 ) . Trafﬁcking of E - CAD has been shown to be essential for the generation and turnover of cell - cell contacts in the context of vertebrate development ( Nanes and Kowalczyk , 2012 ; Song et al . , 2013 ) . However , it is unclear whether E - CAD undergoes endocytosis in mESCs and , if so , which pathways of intracellular trafﬁcking are utilized , and whether this impacts pluripotency . We observed that E - CAD co - localized with CLTC ( Figures 2B and S3D ) , and co - immunoprecipitated with the clathrin adaptor AP2 complex subunit , AP2 a ( Figure S3C ) , conﬁrm - ing that E - CAD indeed associates with the CME machinery in mESCs . E - CAD localization was also abundantly de - tected in RAB11 - positive recycling endosomes ( Figures 2C and S3E ) . RAB7 - positive late endosomes and LAMP2 - posi - tive lysosomes , which target cargo for lysosomal degrada - tion , were largely devoid of E - CAD ( Figures S3F and S3G ) . E - CAD was predominantly present on the membrane in mESCs ( Figure 2B ) . We disrupted its normal localization through two approaches : ( 1 ) treatment with an E - CAD neutralizing antibody ( DECMA1 ) , which prevents the dimerization of E - CAD , resulting in its internalization ; and ( 2 ) treatment with EDTA , a metal ion chelating agent that chelates the extracellular Ca 2 + , preventing E - CAD ( E ) Scatterplot showing the quantitation of E - CAD levels , membrane versus cytoplasmic , in the presence of the E - CAD neutralizing antibody , DECMA1 . * * p < 0 . 01 by two - tailed Student’s t test .

Treatment of mESCs with either DECMA1 or EDTA resulted in a loss of cell - cell contacts and decreased E - CAD on the cell surface ( Figures 2D , 2E , S3H , and S3I ) . This was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of pluripotency marker genes ( Figures 2F and S3J ) , similar to what was previously observed in E - cad null mESCs ( Redmer et al . , 2011 ) . Treatment of mESCs with DECMA1 , or EDTA , resulted in increased accumulation of E - CAD in RAB11 - positive recyclingendosomes ( Figures2D , 2E , S3H , andS3I ) . Todeter - mine whether recycling of E - CAD was essential for the plu - ripotency of mESCs , we knocked down Rab11 ( Figure S3K ) , or blocked endosomal recycling by treating cells with the pharmacological inhibitor , Baﬁlomycin A1 ( vesicular ATPase inhibitor that blocks endocytic recycling ) ( Presley et al . , 1997 ) . This resulted in an increased accumulation of E - CAD in RAB11 - positive endosomes ( Figures 2G and 2H ) and a decrease in the expression of pluripotency marker genes ( Figures 2I and 2J ) . Taken together , our results imply that the normal membrane localization , internalization through CME , and the recycling of E - CAD are essential for the pluripotency of mESCs . Thus , the normal trafﬁcking of E - CADisimperativetomaintainthepluripotencyofmESCs . CME Suppresses TGF - b / SMAD Signaling to Maintain E - CAD Expression and mESC Pluripotency The loss of CME resulted in a dramatic phenotype , with loss of cell - cell contacts and a decrease in levels of E - cad / E - CAD at both the transcript and protein levels ( Figures 2A , 3A , S2 , S3A , S4A , and S4B ) , highly reminiscent of the action of a core epithelial - mesenchymal transition driver , TGF - b signaling ( Lamouille et al . , 2014 ; Nieto et al . , 2016 ; Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Increased TGF - b signaling is associated with the differentiation of ESCs ( Fei et al . , 2010 ) , and is also known to play a negative role during somatic cell re - programming ( Ichida et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Subrama - nyam et al . , 2011 ) . Activation of the TGF - b / SMAD signaling pathway results in the expression of transcription factors Snai1 ( Snail ) , Snai2 ( Slug ) , and Zeb1 , which tran - scriptionally repress E - cad ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Blocking CME resulted in the stabilization of TGF - b R1 levels accompanied by elevated levels of active TGF - b / SMAD signaling , deter - mined by phospho - SMAD2 / 3 levels ( Figures 3B , 3C , S4C , S4E , and S4F ) . Blocking CME resulted in increased expres - sion of Snai1 , Snai2 , Zeb1 , and Cdh2 in mESCs ( Figures 3D and S4D ) . TGF - b R1 co - localized with CLTC and the late endosomal marker , RAB7 ( Figures 3E , 3F , S4G , and S4H ) , suggesting that TGF - b R1 is internalized through CME and targeted for lysosomal degradation . Minimal to no co - localization was observed with RAB11 , suggesting minimal or no recy - cling of TGF - b R1 in mESCs ( Figure S4I ) . To determine whether TGF - b R1 was indeed targeted for lysosomal degra - dation , we used siRNAs to knock down Rab7 ( Figure S4J ) . We observed an accumulation of LC3 - 2 , a protein that is degraded in the lysosome ( Figure S4K ) , indicating a block in lysosomal degradation on loss of Rab7 . This was accom - panied by an increase in the levels of TGF - b R1 ( Figure 3G ) , pSMAD2 / 3 ( Figure 3H ) , and mesenchymal markers ( Fig - ure 3I ) . The mesenchymal genes Snai1 , Snai2 , and Zeb1 are known to transcriptionally repress E - cad expression . Indeed , knockdown of Rab7 resulted in a decrease in E - cad / E - CAD expression , presumably through a feedback loop involving downstream targets of TGF - b R1 signaling ( Figures 3J and S4K ) , similar to what was observed upon Cltc knockdown . These observations were further validated by treatment of mESCs with the lysosomal inhibitor , chlo - roquine , resulting in increased levels of LC3 - 2 ( Figure S4L ) , TGF - b R1 ( Figure S4M ) , and pSMAD2 / 3 ( Figure S4N ) . Block - ing lysosomal degradation also resulted in a decrease in E - CAD levels ( Figure S4O ) , similar to what we observed upon knockdown of Rab7 ( Figure S4K ) . Together these re - sults show that CME negatively regulates TGF - b / SMAD signaling to maintain E - CAD expression and the pluripo - tency of mESCs . Based on these observations , we constructed a mathe - matical model for the inter - relationships between TGF - b signaling , E - CAD , and CLTC ( Figure 3K ; Table S1 ) . Keeping all other parameters constant , clathrin depletion was modeled by decreasing the parameter for clathrin levels by 10 - fold . The depletion of clathrin resulted in a decrease in E - CAD levels , due to an increase in TGF - b signaling , consistent with the experimental observations . In addi - tion , the model predicted an initial transient increase in membrane - bound E - CAD ( not shown here ) upon clathrin depletion , which is explained as the effect of decreased internalization resulting from the depletion of CLTC . We further used the model to ask whether decreasing TGF - b signaling upon clathrin depletion could restore the cell to its original state . We simulated a decrease in TGF - b signaling following Cltc depletion , by changing the param - eter Kitmec ( Table S1 ) , which changes the sensitivity of the E - CAD formation rate to TGF - b R levels by 5 - fold , keeping other parameters constant . From the simulation results ( ‘‘reduced clathrin and TGF - b R dependence’’ set ) we pre - dicted that this leads to a restoration of E - CAD ( membrane bound ) , and possibly even a higher level due to the reduced internalization even though there is no effect on the mem - brane - bound TGF - b R levels ( Figure 3L ) . Based on the constructed model , we predicted that perhaps the normal balance of signaling could be restored in mESCs in the absence of CME by blocking the aberrant increase in TGF - b / Smad signaling . To test this , we treated Cltc - depleted mESCs with TGF - b R1 kinase inhibitors , RepSox ( Ichida et al . , 2009 ) , or SB431542 . Inhibition of TGF - b / Smad signaling resulted in a partial rescue of the 156 Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 12 j 152 – 164 j January 8 , 2019 phenotype with restoration of cell - cell contacts of mESCs , along with increased AP activity ( Figure 4A ) , OCT3 / 4 and E - CAD expression ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . The overexpression of E - cad alone also ( Figure 5A ) resulted in a rescue of plurip - otency in the background of decreased CME ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . These results indicate that CME plays a vital role in regu - lating the balance between opposing signals such as E - CAD ( pro - pluripotency ) and TGF - b ( pro - differentiation ) in ESCs . E - CADisalsoknowntoassociatewithotherproteinssuch as b - CATENIN ( Nanes and Kowalczyk , 2012 ) . b - CATENIN signaling is required for the maintenance of mESC pluripotency and self - renewal ( Anton et al . , 2007 ; Miya - bayashi et al . , 2007 ) . Indeed we found that as reported earlier ( Nanes and Kowalczyk , 2012 ) , b - CATENIN associ - ated with E - CAD in mESCs ( Figure S5A ) . Knockdown of Cltc resulted in decreased b - CATENIN levels ( Figure S5B ) and enhanced phospho - b - CATENIN levels ( Figure S5B ) , Figure 3 .

In addition , we also observed enhanced levels of active phospho - ERK1 / 2 levels ( Fig - ure S5E ) , which is associated with the differentiation of mESCs toward the neural and mesodermal lineages ( Ku - nath et al . , 2007 ; Stavridis et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , we also observed for the ﬁrst time an interaction between E - CAD and ERK in mESCs ( Figures S5C and S5D ) , indicating that E - CAD may function as a hub to regulate the activity of other proteins involved in the pluripotency of mESCs . The naı¨ve state of ESCs is maintained by culturing them in a media containing mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MEK ) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 b ( GSK3 b ) inhibitors ( Ying et al . , 2008 ) . We therefore sought to determine whether the loss of pluripotency upon Cltc knockdown could be rescued by treatment with either the MEK inhibi - tor , or the GSK3 b inhibitor ( 1i ) , or both ( 2i ) . Indeed , we found that the knockdown of Cltc in mESCs cultured in MEK inhibitor or 2i medium did not result in a signiﬁcant decrease in pluripotency ( Figures S5F and S5G ) , suggesting that the elevation in MEK signaling alone , or in combina - tion with decreased b - CATENIN levels in the absence of CME , plays a signiﬁcant role in exiting the pluripotent state . In summary , our data indicate that CME plays a crucial role in maintaining a ﬁne balance between antagonistic signalingpathways , suchasTGF - b / SMAD , ERK , b - CATENIN , andE - CAD . CMEisrequiredfortheinternalizationandrecy - cling of E - CAD , and for the lysosomal degradation of TGF - b R1inmESCs . Any disruptionin thistrafﬁckingmechanism leads to dominance of the differentiation signal , TGF - b , along with elevated levels of phospho - ERK , and reduced levels of b - CATENIN , resulting in a cell fate change . We ﬁnd that repression of the differentiation signal is sufﬁcient to some extent to restore the pluripotent state . Our results thus demonstrate that CME is required for the normal pluripotent state of mESCs , and that altering CME levels may permit ESCs to exit the pluripotent state . DISCUSSION While endocytosis plays a major role in metazoan develop - ment , it remains largely unknown as to whether and how it can function as a regulator of cell fate decisions . Here we demonstrate that CME functions as a novel regulator of ESC pluripotency . Decrease in the level of CME in ESCs results in an exit from the pluripotent state . We further Figure 4 .

It is well appreciated that cell - cell adhesion mediated by E - CAD is crucial for maintaining mESC self - renewal ( Murray et al . , 2013 ; Redmer et al . , 2011 ; Soncin et al . , 2011 ) . Our ﬁndings show that the internalization and recycling of E - CAD via CME is crucial to maintain the stem cell state of mESCs . Although the mechanistic un - derpinnings of this regulation are unclear , based on our data and previous studies with the NOTCH receptor and GPCRs ( Windler and Bilder , 2010 ; Eichel et al . , 2016 ) we speculate that E - CAD trafﬁcking via CME may facilitate its transition through different intracellular compartments to either undergo conformational changes or association with other proteins , ultimately resulting in an altered signaling output . While RAP1 has been previously described to play a role in the recycling of E - CAD , it is un - clear as to whether this is dependent on CME ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . Our data are also strengthened by our observation that E - CAD is enriched in ESC - derived endosomes ( Nar - ayana et al . unpublished data ) . A similar mechanism has also been described with pSTAT3 in mESCs , where its asso - ciation with the endosomal protein ASRIJ regulates STAT3 signaling , as well as the expression of pluripotency genes ( Sinha et al . , 2013 ) . In addition to the recycling of E - CAD , CME also plays a major role in maintaining the expression of E - cad by lysosomal degradation of the TGF - b receptor . Earlier studies in non - stem cells show that TGF - b receptors were recycled via CME ( Chen , 2009 ; Hayes et al . , 2002 ; Mitchell et al . , 2004 ) . Previous studies have also demonstrated that CME is involved in enhancing signals downstream of the TGF - b receptor , while the cav - eolin - mediated endocytic route targets these receptors for degradation ( Di Guglielmo et al . , 2003 ; Scita and Di Fiore , 2010 ) , indicating a requirement for speciﬁc compart - mentalization of the same receptor to achieve opposing outcomes . We have previously demonstrated that caveo - lin - mediated endocytosis is largely absent in mESCs ( Mote et al . , 2017 ) , and here we demonstrate that CME pro - motes the lysosomal degradation of the TGF - b receptor . Such varying utilizations of trafﬁcking pathways in the context of the same receptor may be a reﬂection of the spe - ciﬁc state of a cell , and an attempt to maintain a balance in signaling outcomes to support a particular cell fate . While it remains elusive as to how CME is involved in sorting a spe - ciﬁc cargo to different compartments in stem versus non - stem cells , our ﬁndings show that CME balances opposing signals to maintain ESC pluripotency by sorting molecules to different compartments . In addition , we also see that both b - CATENIN and ERK associate with E - CAD , implicating yet another layer of regulation in ESCs , linked to E - CAD . It remains to be seen whether the activity of ERK and b - CATENIN are dependent on the internalization of E - CAD . Our results demonstrate that we could rescue the decrease in pluripotency caused by the loss of CME by either inhibiting the TGF - b or MEK signaling pathway , or by overexpressing E - cad , indicating that CME does indeed regulate the activity of multiple signaling pathways and molecules in mESCs . Together , our data demonstrate that an intact trafﬁcking machinery is essential for regulating the activity of key signaling mol - ecules , all of which are intimately linked to the pluripotent state of a stem cell .

Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 12 j 152 – 164 j January 8 , 2019 159 Itis well established that CME isone of themajor routesof endocytosis in differentiated cells ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Traub , 2009 ) . Recent results comparing the rate of CME between human ESCs and differentiated cells show that the rate of endocytosis decreases as stem cells differen - tiate ( Dambournetetal . , 2018 ) . Further , thiswasalsoaccom - panied by changes in types of clathrin coats that were observed as ESCs underwent differentiation . This is in line with our observation that ESCs differentiate upon reduction of CME . In addition , our data suggest that a temporary reduction of CME , or a ﬁne - tuning of levels of endocytosis in a cell that possesses the potential to switch fate , such as a stem cell , can provide a novel handle to regulate cell fate changes . Further studies in understanding the mechanistic role of endocytosis will expand our understanding about the role of cellular trafﬁcking in stemness , cell fate decisions and development .

Non - targeting esiRNA was prepared using GFP as a template in all experiments . Western Blotting Protein lysates were separated on SDS - PAGE , blotted onto a poly - vinylidene ﬂuoride membrane , and blocked with 5 % BSA or skimmed milk . Primary antibodies were used at speciﬁc concen - trations overnight , followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody . Immunocytochemistry and Imaging mESCs were cultured on glass coverslips coated with 0 . 2 % gelatin . Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 10 min at 37 (cid:2) C , followed by blocking and permeabilization using 5 % BSA containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Incubation with primary antibody was done overnight at 4 (cid:2) C , followed by washing and incubation with secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature , and washing and mounting using VECTASHIELD ( Vector Labora - tories ) . All confocal imaging was done using the Leica SP5 confocal microscope , and imaged using a 63 3 1 . 4 NA objective . Bright - ﬁeld images were taken using Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope with either the 20 3 or 10 3 objective . Teratoma Formation Assay mESCs ( 25 3 10 5 ) stably expressing scrambled or Cltc shRNA were suspended in 50 m L knockout DMEM and 10 m L of Matrigel . Nude mice were anesthetized with diethyl ether and 60 m L of cell suspen - sion was injected subcutaneously into the dorsal ﬂank of mice . Tumors were surgically dissected and measured and ﬁxed in 4 % PFA 3 weeks post injection , and embedded in parafﬁn . Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin . All protocols involving animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee . Embryoid Body Formation Embryoid bodies were formed by hanging drop method ( 500 cells / 20 m L drop ) . Embryoid bodieswere formedinES mediawithoutLIF for 3 days . After 3 days these embryoid bodies were cultured on Matrigel - coated dishes for 6 days . Post 6 days , cells were collected for RNA isolation . Co - immunoprecipitation Co - immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the cell lysate ( lysed using 1 % NP40 cell lysis buffer ) with speciﬁc antibody and Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) . The supernatant was separated using Dynamag and analyzed by western blotting . Normal IgG was used as antibody control . Membrane - Cytoplasmic Fractionation For fractionation , cells were osmotically lysed in buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 8 ] , 0 . 1 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 20 % glycerol ) , followed by passing of the lysate through an insulin syringe . The supernatant ( cytoplasmic fraction ) was collected by spinning at 14 , 000 rpm for 60 min . The membrane fraction was collected by lysing the pellet in buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 8 ] , 0 . 1 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , 20 % glycerol , and 0 . 5 % Triton - X 100 ) , followed by spinning at 14 , 000 rpm , for 30 min . Mathematical Modeling TGF - b R and E - CAD are assumed to be present in membrane - bound , cytoplasmic , endosomal , and lysosomal forms . In addi - tion , E - CAD is assumed to also exist in a recycling endosome . The presence of additional compartments , such as recycling endo - some , or lumping / merging compartments , coupled with a compensatory change in the rate constants does not qualitatively change these results . The rates of interactions are assumed to follow mass - action kinetics . TGF - b ligand is assumed to be constantly available , and therefore the inhibition of E - cad expres - sion by TGF - b signaling is assumed to be mediated by the level of the receptors present at the membrane , and consequently the downstream signaling . Inhibition is incorporated by including a Hill - like inhibitory term ( with a coefﬁcient of 2 ) to the zero - order formation kinetics . Inhibition of TGF - b signaling is modeled as an increase in the inhibition constant , which is equivalent to a reduction in the amount of membrane - bound TGF - b R available for inhibition . Based on these kinetics , a mass balance for each of the nine components of the system shown , leads to a system of 9 coupled ordinary differential equations , which include the effect of the 22 reactions and 28 parameters ( equations and parameters are listed in Table S1 ) . The equations were integrated with the ode15s function of MATLAB version 9 . 2 and SimBiology version 5 . 6 with relative and absolute tolerance 10 (cid:3) 8 until steady state was achieved , and this state was assumed to be the pre - treatment state of the system . The values were scaled to the maximum value following all the simulations ( clathrin depletion , clathrin depletion with decreased TGF - b signaling ) . Transferrin Uptake Assay mESCs ( 20 , 000 ) were plated followed by transfection with Cltc esiRNAs or the mentioned plasmids after 24 hr . Next day , the cells were plated on 0 . 2 % gelatin - coated glass coverslips . After 48 hr , cells were serum starved in plain knockout DMEM at 37 (cid:2) C . After 1 hr , cells were incubated with Transferrin - Alexa Fluor 488 ( 5 m g / 100 m L ) ( no . 015 - 540 - 050 , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 10 min at 37 (cid:2) C , washed with acid wash buffer ( 0 . 2 M glycine , 0 . 15 M NaCl [ pH 3 . 0 ] ) for 30 s to remove surface - bound and non - speciﬁc transferrin . Cells were washed three times in PBS , ﬁxed in 4 % PFA , and imaged . All images were analyzed using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . The total amount of internalized transferrin was quantiﬁed from cells as mean gray value , and background - subtracted values are represented from three independent experiments . Statistical Analysis Error bars represent mean ± SD for three independent experiments ( n = 3 ) . Statistical signiﬁcance , * p < 0 . 05 ; * * p < 0 . 01 ; * * * p < 0 . 001 , was determined by two - tailed Student’s t test . mRNA expression is normalized to GAPDH and represented relative to non - targeting siRNA control . For comparing multiple groups of data , one - way ANOVA was used . If the p value for the comparison was < 0 . 05 , then individual groups were compared with each other using a post - hoc Tukey - Kramer test . Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 12 j 152 – 164 j January 8 , 2019 161 Apoptosis Analysis Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % PFA for 10 min , followed by staining with Hoechst 33342 for 10 min . Cells were scored as apoptotic based on the presence of fragmented and / or condensed DNA , as described previously ( Chakrabarti et al . , 2004 ) . As a positive control for apoptosis , cells were treated with camptothecin ( 6 m M ) for 12 hr . siRNA Screening mESCs ( 2 , 000 ) were plated per well in a 96 - well plate on day 0 . On day 1 , cells were transfected with siRNAs from the Dharmacon Membrane Trafﬁcking siGENOME Library ( GU - 015500 - 05 ) . None of the siRNAs were validated for their efﬁciency at the time of screening . Each well received a pool of four siRNAs against a single gene . At the time of transfection , cells were shifted to ESC medium minus LIF . Cells were ﬁxed on day 4 and stained for AP ( Vector Lab - oratories ) and co - stained with DAPI . Each plate included ten con - trol wells that were mock - transfected . Five were maintained in ESC medium and the other ﬁve in ESC minus LIF . Image Analysis All micrographs were analyzed using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . Im - ages were background - subtracted and quantiﬁed as mean gray values . For transferrin uptake assay , total cell ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed from three independent experiments . For E - CAD mem - brane / cytoplasmic quantiﬁcation , total and cytoplasmic protein expressions were quantiﬁed from the middle section of the z stack . The membrane E - CAD expression was calculated by subtracting cytoplasmic from total expression , and represented as membrane versus cytoplasmic ratio from three independent experiments . Screen Analysis Every individual well of screen plates was imaged using the BD pathway 855 , 4 3 objective , 5 3 5 matrix . All analysis was done using custom programs written in MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . All im - ages were read into MATLAB as two - dimensional matrices of pixel intensities . Images for the control wells were visually screened for the presence of imaging artifacts and wells with obvious artifacts like reﬂections were excluded . All pixels with intensity greater thanaspeciﬁedthresholdvalueintheDAPIimagewereconsidered to be cells . In a subset of wells , the choice of this threshold value was visually checked using two criteria : ( 1 ) all chosen pixels did indeed correspond to cells and ( 2 ) no cells were omitted . A threshold value of 950 was found to satisfy the above criteria and was used for all wells in all plates . Once pixels corresponding to cells were identiﬁed , the locations of these pixels were transferred to the Texas Red image and a cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the intensities of these pixels was calculated using ecdf ( MATLAB function ) for each well . The pixel values for all of the control wells ( ESCs – LIF ) in a given plate were combined and an average cdf was generated to represent the Control cdf in a given plate . The largest difference between the cdf for each well and the Control cdf was then calculated for each well ( kstest2 ) . These differences for each of the individual control wells gave us a mea - sure of differences that could occur purely by chance . The differ - ences for all wells were normalized into a Z score as follows : Wells with a Z score > 2 . 5 or % 2 . 5 were considered as wells that had signiﬁcant changes in their cdf and the direction of change was analyzed to see if they had more or less Texas Red staining compared with the Control cdf .
