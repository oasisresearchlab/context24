Beggs @ bham . ac . uk Abstract Background : In January 2020 reports of unidentified severe respiratory illness were described in Wuhan , China . A rapid expansion in cases affecting most countries around the globe led to major changes in the way people live their daily lives . In the United Kingdom , the Department of Health and Social Care directed healthcare providers to establish additional resources to manage the anticipated surge in cases that could overwhelm the health services . A priority area was testing for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA and its detection by qualitative RT - PCR . Design : A laboratory workflow twinning research environment with clinical laboratory capabilities was implemented and validated in the University of Birmingham within 4 days of the project initiation . The diagnostic capability was centred on an IVD CE - marked RT - PCR kit and designed to provide surge capacity to the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital . The service was initially tasked with testing healthcare workers ( HCW ) using throat swabs , and subsequently the process investigated the utility of using saliva as an alternative sample type . Results : Between the 8 th April 2020 and the 30 th April 2020 , the laboratory tested a total of 1282 HCW for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in throat swabs . RNA was detected in 54 % of those who reported symptoms compatible with COVID - 19 , but in only 4 % who were asymptomatic . Conclusion : This capability was established rapidly and utilised a cold - chain free methodology , applicable to a wide range of settings , and which can provide surge capacity and support to clinical laboratories facing increasing pressure during periods of national crisis .

Background SARS - CoV - 2 is an emerging sarbecovirus , closely related to SARS - CoV - 1 that emerged in China in 2004 [ 1 ] . This new strain was first described in January 2020 as a cause of a novel severe respiratory illness now known as COVID - 19 . As of the 3 rd May 3 , 356 , 205 confirmed cases were reported globally with 238 , 730 deaths , affecting 215 countries around the world [ 2 ] . The rapid development of the pandemic highlights the need to speedily assemble the capability to support healthcare services in a variety of international settings . Responsive capacity building was part of the United Kingdom’s strategy to rapidly scale up testing for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in respiratory samples using qRT - PCR . A directive from the Department of Health and Social Care , and National Health Service Improvement ( NHSI ) instructed NHS hospitals to identify the means to increase testing capacity [ 3 ] . Accordingly , the University of Birmingham ( UoB ) was included in an extended laboratory network to provide additional capacity to the existing diagnostic laboratories in the West Midlands region , particularly to support healthcare worker testing . Rapid technology and knowledge transfer combined with a partnership between a UKAS - accredited clinical service and academic research infrastructure reconfigured the laboratories into a molecular diagnostic service capable of providing quality assured testing using a verified commercial test . External support was provided by Public Health England clinical virologists in an advisory role . This manuscript describes the rapid implementation and validation of the process to support healthcare worker testing in the West Midlands at the University of Birmingham . Study design and Materials Initially , 120 specimens were tested by both the SARS - CoV - 2 testing process at the University and at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital to verify the assay and validate the diagnostic process . This total consisted of 94 residual RNA extracts anonymised at source , and 26 respiratory swabs collected from in - patients giving informed consent to provide 2 swabs to assist with improving diagnostics . Secondly , a total of 1283 nose & throat swabs were collected from volunteer healthcare workers ( HCW ) giving informed consent for their samples to be tested for SARS - 2 - CoV . Of these , 258 specimens were self - taken , and 1025 collected by research nurses in the Institute of Translational Medicine . Samples were received and logged at Containment Level 2 ( CL - 2 ) before safe transfer to Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens ( ACDP ) Containment Level 3 ( CL - 3 ) facilities , where sample inactivation [ 5 ] was performed with buffer ATL ( Qiagen ) . Samples were processed further at CL - 2 using the RNEasy Mini Kit reagents ( Qiagen ) . qRT - PCR testing for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was performed J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal of Clinical Virology 2020 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 10 using the VIASURE qRT - PCR detection test for SARS - CoV - 2 ( CerTest ; Prolabs ) . The VIASURE test is a multiplex of three targets : the viral N and ORF1ab genes ( China - CDC ) [ 4 ] , and a synthetic internal control to detect assay inhibition . Lyophilized reaction reagents were reconstituted , 15µl of master mix used per reaction with the addition of 5µl sample RNA . Thermocycling was performed on either ABI 7500 or QuantStudio 5 instruments . All preliminary data analysis from qRT - PCR analyses was performed using the Thermo Cloud software ( Thermo Scientific ) , with automated threshold and baseline setting followed by careful manual inspection of individual amplification curves by two senior experienced operators . Final interpretation of the RT - PCR assay results was as specified in the manufacturer instructions for use ( IFU ) . Confirmatory testing on indeterminate results was performed with E gene assay [ 4 ] . These results were transmitted electronically to the UKAS - accredited service , for reporting to the NHS Trust and Public Health England surveillance systems . Study Results To investigate the analytical sensitivity of the VIASURE qRT - PCR , it was compared to the analytical sensitivity of the SARS - 2 - CoV ‘E’ gene assay described by the WHO [ 4 ] , and which is a more widely characterised tests ( Table 1 ) . The VIASURE Orf1ab detection appears to be an estimated 10 - fold less sensitive than the E gene assay , but 10 - fold more sensitive than the RdRp gene . The VIASURE N gene assay appeared to be of comparable sensitivity to the RdRp gene target ( Figure 1 ) . Comparative testing against other validated assays was performed using in - house control material derived from pooled patient specimens where RNA from SARS - CoV - 2 had been detected . Samples were tested on WHO RdRp and E gene assays in parallel with the VIASURE qRT - PCR assay . The mean Ct value obtained with the E gene ( WHO ) , the N gene and Orf1ab gene assays ( VIASURE ) were not significantly different by repeated measures ANOVA . However , analysis demonstrated that RdRp was significantly different from E gene , N - gene and Orf1ab gene ( p = < 0 . 0001 ) , with an average deviation in Ct value of + 5 . 4 Ct , indicating a significant difference in assay sensitivity ( Figure 2 ) . Gaining experience of qRT - PCR testing and reproducibility of the workflow was initially assessed by testing ( a ) a panel of residual RNA preparations from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital which had been extracted and previously tested on the Altona commercial qRT - PCR assay ( n = 94 ) or ( b ) original respiratory samples collected from patients the same day and tested on an Abbott m2000 commercial qRT - PCR assay ( n = 26 ) . Results of these comparisons are shown in Table 2 . The Ct values obtained for each assay were analysed by Pearson correlation analysis in a pairwise fashion , indicating a strong correlation in all comparisons ( R 2 = > 0 . 88 ; Figure 3 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal of Clinical Virology 2020 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 10 In the comparison of the 94 RNA extracts tested by VIASURE and Altona , the majority of positive and negative results agreed between the two tests . Importantly , there were no Altona positive results that were found negative by VIASURE . Three Altona negative samples had equivocal results on VIASURE , where the ORF1ab target was negative but N gene target detected at Ct < 38 ; albeit still relative high Cts ( at 36 , 33 , and 36 ) . In the second analysis of 26 clinical samples , the end - to - end process of testing from fresh respiratory specimens was compared with that at QEH . By coincidence , the QEH Pathology testing method had changed from Altona to Abbott m2000 , an assay which has acknowledged greater analytical sensitivity than the Altona . Nevertheless , the results of the direct comparison showed that there was 100 % concordance between positive and negative results obtained by VIASURE and the Abbott test ( Table 2 ) . Combining the results and experience of performing the VIASURE test in a full diagnostic process , with further adjustments to reduce the chances of contamination , the VIASURE test was considered as verified for use . Accordingly , the VIASURE test was utilized in the analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic HCW . Throat swab samples were taken from 1283 subjects and tested between the 8th April and the 30 th April , with an overall SARS - 2 - CoV detection rate of 53 / 1230 . A detection frequency of 15 % ( 37 / 258 ) was found in cases where symptoms were in keeping with COVID - 19 diagnosis . Sixteen of 1025 ( 1 . 6 % ) HCW with no compatible symptoms and defined as asymptomatic had detectable levels of viral RNA in their throat swabs . Saliva was collected from 525 of the same HCW cohort as part of a prevalence study of asymptomatic viral shedding . Fifteen oral fluid samples from subjects with positive results by throat swab , were tested using the VIASURE , of which five were positive . The Ct values were lower ( by approximately 3 - 5 Ct ) compared to results on the subject’s throat swab , suggesting a higher viral load in saliva . Interestingly , follow - up of these asymptomatic HCW whose saliva specimens were positive indicated that they later developed symptoms compatible with COVID - 19 disease . It is unclear however whether patients were truly asymptomatic at the time of sampling , or possibly overlooked mild symptoms ; as they were not formally clinically assessed . Therefore , saliva may represent a specimen type that can provide a more unambiguous indicator of potential infectivity , removing the equivocality of low - level positive throat swab results . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal of Clinical Virology 2020 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 10 The capacity to rapidly deploy extra laboratory capabilities to support surges in diagnostic testing workload , or to support the development of testing infrastructure in rural and remote areas , will be essential to controlling the current SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic .
