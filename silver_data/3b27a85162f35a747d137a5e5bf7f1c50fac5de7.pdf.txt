L E T T E R S 46 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 8 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2006 Flotillin - 1 defines a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway in mammalian cells Oleg O . Glebov 1 , Nicholas A . Bright 2 and Benjamin J . Nichols 1 , 3 Previous studies provide evidence for an endocytic mechanism in mammalian cells that is distinct from both clathrin - coated pits and caveolae 1 – 5 , and is not inhibited by overexpression of GTPase - null dynamin mutants 1 – 4 , 6 . This mechanism , however , has been defined largely in these negative terms . We applied a ferro - fluid - based purification of endosomes to identify endosomal proteins . One of the proteins identified in this way was flotillin - 1 ( also called reggie - 2 ) 7 , 8 . Here , we show that flotillin - 1 resides in punctate structures within the plasma membrane and in a specific population of endocytic intermediates . These intermediates accumulate both glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - linked proteins and cholera toxin B subunit 4 , 9 . Endocytosis in flotillin - 1 - containing intermediates is clathrin - independent . Total internal reflection microscopy and immuno - electron microscopy revealed that flotillin - 1 - containing regions of the plasma membrane seem to bud into the cell , and are distinct from clathrin - coated pits and caveolin - 1 - positive caveolae 10 . Flotillin - 1 small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) inhibited both clathrin - independent uptake of cholera toxin and endocytosis of a GPI - linked protein . We propose that flotillin - 1 is one determinant of a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway in mammalian cells . We have developed a magnetic purification of endosomes based on ferro - fluid uptake 10 , 11 . A full biochemical and proteomic analysis of these endosomes will be published elsewhere . This study describes the function of one protein that was identified in purified endosomes , flotil - lin - 1 , during clathrin - independent endocytosis . Previous studies indi - cate that flotillin - 1 is localized to the cell surface in several cell lines 12 – 15 . Flotillin - 1 may be a component of morphologically defined caveolae in some cell types , but it is expressed in cells and organisms that lack the defining protein components of caveolae , caveolins , and the relationship between caveolins and flotillin - 1 is not clear 7 , 16 . Flotillin - 1 has also been reported to reside in lysosomes and other endocytic compartments , as well as in the nucleus 14 , 15 , 17 . Indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies against flo - tillin - 1 in HeLa cells revealed puncta that , in thin confocal sections , were 1 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 2QH , UK . 2 Cambridge Institute of Medical Research , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 2XY , UK . 3 Correspondence should be addressed to B .

Flotillin - 1 - specific siRNAs reduced the signal from indirect immunofluorescence to below 20 % of control , so these structures are likely to represent specific staining of flotillin - 1 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . Fluorescence from carboxy - terminal fusion of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) to flotillin - 1 had a distribution that was indistinguishable from that of the native protein when expressed at simi - lar levels ( Fig . 1a ) . Approximately 40 % of the larger flotillin - 1 - positive structures were identified as endosomes that are labelled with dextran ( M r = 10K ) that has been internalized for 15 min ( Fig . 1b ) . Flotillin - 1 is additionally present in lysosomes 14 , 15 , and we observed some colocaliza - tion between flotillin - 1 structures and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 ( not shown ) . Uptake for 15 min is , however , too short a period for fluid phase accumulation to occur in lysosomal compartments , indicating that flotil - lin - 1 is also present earlier in the endocytic pathway 10 . Magnetic purifica - tion of endosomes using internalization of ferro - fluid ( see Methods ) , and western blotting of purified endosomal and control fractions confirmed that fluid - containing endosomes contain flotillin - 1 and could be purified in a specific time - and temperature - dependent manner ( Fig . 1c ) . Ferro - fluid accumulated in flotillin - 1 - containing endosomes after as little as 5 min uptake , and flotillin - 1 was enriched relative to total protein in these endosomes ( Fig . 1d ) . Flotillin - 1 did not colocalize with endocytosed transferrin , indicating that it might be associated with a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway ( Fig . 1e , and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) . Glycosylphosphat idylinositol ( GPI ) - linked proteins can , at least in part , be endocytosed via such a pathway 3 , 4 , and colocalization between flotillin - 1 – GFP and internal - ized antibodies against the GPI - linked protein CD59 was readily observed ( Fig . 1f ) . Budding of caveolae from the cell surface provides one mechanism for clathrin - independent endocytosis 18 , 19 , but there was no colocalization between flotillin - 1 and caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 1g , 2a ) . These experiments in HeLa cells indicated that flotillin - 1 could be associated with endocytosis via a pathway that is independent of both clathrin and caveolin - 1 ( refs 1 , 3 , 4 , 20 ) . To address this possibility more carefully , we carried out experiments in COS - 7 cells , which have more favourable morphology than HeLa cells and express more glycosphingolipid GM1 , facilitating use of cholera toxin B subunit ( CTB ) as a marker for endocytosis 1 . print ncb1342 . indd 46 print ncb1342 . indd 46 13 / 12 / 05 4 : 51 : 52 pm 13 / 12 / 05 4 : 51 : 52 pm Nature Publishing Group ©200 6 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 8 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2006 47 L E T T E R S Flotillin - 1 – GFP that was expressed at low levels in COS - 7 cells was , as in HeLa cells , found in punctate structures that are apparently asso - ciated with the plasma membrane and also in assumed intracellular structures . There was no overlap between flotillin - 1 – GFP , caveolin - 1 and transferrin after a period of 1 min of uptake ( Fig . 2a ) . CTB can be internalized both via coated pits and via clathrin - independent mechanisms 1 , 9 , 20 – 22 . Its use as a marker therefore allows simultaneous visualization of different endocytic compartments . To visualize early or primary endocytic intermediates containing CTB , we labelled cells on ice , warmed them to 37°C for 1 min and then stripped the extracellular CTB by washing at pH 2 . 0 at 4°C . This was sufficient to remove more than 90 % of surface - bound CTB ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) . Although much of the internalized CTB colocalized with transferrin , there was also clear colocalization between flotillin - 1 – GFP and CTB in a separate population of endocytic structures ( Fig . 2b ) . These structures accounted for less than 15 % of total flotillin - 1 – GFP fluorescence , as most flotillin - 1 – GFP is localized to the plasma mem - brane rather than to internal membranes . Expression of the truncated form of the protein AP180 ( AP180 - C ) , which blocks recruitment of clathrin to the plasma membrane 23 , was used to address whether the uptake of CTB into flotillin - 1 - positive , intracellular structures is clathrin - dependent . In AP180 - C - expressing cells in which transferrin uptake was completely blocked , CTB was still endocytosed into flotil - lin - 1 – GFP - containing structures ( Fig . 2c ; internalization detected by low pH wash , as above ) . Acid washing at pH 2 . 0 causes changes in cell morphology and may alter the distribution of intracellular markers , so we sought an alternative approach to confirm that CTB is present in flotillin - 1 - positive intrac - ellular structures . Cells were labelled on ice with CTB – Cy3 and then warmed up to 37°C for 1 min before fixation . Fixed , non - permeabilized cells were then labelled with a fivefold excess of CTB – Cy5 , so that inter - nalized structures contained CTB – Cy3 but not CTB – Cy5 . The amount of CTB – Cy3 used in the initial labelling was sufficient to occupy only 20 % of total CTB - binding sites ( see Supplementary Information , Figs 3b , c ) . Endocytic vesicles containing CTB and either transferrin , caveolin - 1 or flotillin - 1 were readily detected ( Figs 2d – f ) . Given the absence of colocalization between caveolin - 1 , transferrin and flotillin - 1 described above , this implies that these three markers each define a discrete class of endocytic vesicle . The abundance of each class of vesicle varied from cell to cell , and those containing transferrin were consistently the most abun - dant . These observations imply that flotillin - 1 defines a specific class of clathrin - independent endocytic structure and indicate that uptake in flotillin - 1 - containing vesicles may account for a significant fraction of total clathrin - independent endocytosis . a c e b F1 mAb z = 5 µ m F1 − GFP f g F1 mAb F1 mAb Tf Cav1 pAb F1 − GFP CD59 z = 0 µ m 10K dextran F1 mAb L o a d E l u a t e E l u a t e 4 ˚ C Flotillin - 1 Shp2 ( cytoplasmic ) ERp72 ( ER ) d 0 1 2 0 20 40 60 80 100 Min Total protein Flotillin - 1 Y e il d ( p e r ce n t a g e l o a d ) Figure 1 Flotillin - 1 is found in endosomes and does not colocalize with transferrin or caveolin - 1 .

SDS – PAGE ( 12 % ) followed by western blotting was carried out ; the cleared lysate ( ‘load’ ) and magnetically purified endosomal fraction ( ‘eluate’ ) are shown . The eluate was purified from cells held on ice for the duration of the experiment . Antibodies against flotillin - 1 , Shp2 ( a cytosolic protein ) and ERp72 ( an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein ) were used separately ; specificity of the flotillin - 1 antibody was confirmed in subsequent small interfering RNA experiments ( Fig . 4a ) . A total of 0 . 1 % of lysate and 25 % of the eluate was applied to the gel .

S2 ) . Light microscopy does not allow definitive resolution of plasma - membrane structures compared with sub - membrane vesicles , so we also analysed the distribution of flotillin - 1 – GFP by immuno - electron microscopy . Immunolabelling of ultra - thin cryosections with anti - GFP antibodies confirmed that flotillin - 1 – GFP is localized predominantly to the plasma membrane , either in flat regions or invaginations , as well as to intracellular vesicles .

In agreement with the immunofluorescence data , these vesicles accounted for less than 15 % of total flotillin - 1 staining . Analysis of clathrin - coated pits has been facilitated by the fact that ligands such as transferrin are efficiently concentrated in these struc - tures . We asked whether CTB or GPI - linked proteins are detectably concentrated in flotillin - 1 - containing regions of the plasma membrane . The surface distribution of CTB was not visibly altered in regions of the plasma membrane containing flotillin - 1 – GFP , as assayed by electron microscopy ( Fig . 3a ) . The distribution of both fluorescent CTB and GPI - linked GFP in thin confocal sections or total internal reflection ( TIR ) images of live cells was no different in flotillin - 1 - positive regions of the c Control − Tf siRNA1 − Tf Flotillin - 1 Ponceau Tf CTB - total Tf control a b d CTB - surface CTB - surface CTB - total siRNA 1 Control siRNA 1 Control siRNA2 CTB + Tf CTB alone 20 100 Control siRNA 1 0 0 10 20 30 200 400 Endocytic structures per cell CD59 antibody uptake ( min ) e g f Tf CTB F1 − GFP Clathrin U n t r ea t e d C o n t r o l s i R N A F l o t illi n - 1 s i R N A 1 F l o t illi n - 1 s i R N A 2 Figure 4 Flotillin - 1 siRNAs inhibit clathrin - independent endocytosis .

Therefore , although these data are not sufficient to preclude some selectivity in recruitment of different molecules or lipid domains to flotillin - 1 - containing structures , GPI - linked proteins and CTB are unlikely to be highly enriched in these structures . To follow the dynamics of flotillin - 1 – GFP directly , we used TIR micro - scopy in live cells at 30°C ( as in other recent TIR studies of endocyto - sis 24 ) . Flotillin - 1 - containing regions of the plasma membrane were highly dynamic , and could be observed disappearing as if budding into the cell ( Fig . 3c , and see Supplementary Information , Movies 1 , 2 ) . The behaviour of flotillin - 1 - containing regions was compared with that of clathrin - coated pits ( clathrin - light - chain - B – GFP ) 9 and caveolae ( caveolin - 1 – GFP ) 25 . Flotillin - 1 – GFP puncta were around twice as abundant as either the coated pits or the caveolae and , when followed over time with particle tracking software , they moved laterally with higher mean velocities ( Figs 3d – g ) . Scoring of apparent budding events indicated that flotillin - 1 – GFP - positive structures bud from the plasma membrane at less than one - third the rate of coated pits ( Fig . 3f ) . TIR imaging therefore shows that flotillin - 1 – GFP - positive regions within the plasma membrane can be differentiated from both coated pits and caveolae by their dynamic behaviour , and that these structures seem to bud into the cell . Importantly , recruitment of flotillin - 1 – GFP to punctate structures was readily saturated at increased expression levels ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a ) , and so is unlikely to be due to self - organization by flotillin - 1 – GFP . Rather , there must be some Control Control + Dyn2 − K44A siRNA1 siRNA1 + Dyn2 − K44A Control Control + Dyn2 − K44A siRNA1 siRNA1 + Dyn2 − K44A Tf CTB Uptake ( percentage control ) 0 50 100 b a Dyn2 − K44A Dyn2 − K44A Tf Tf CTB CTB F1 − GFP CTB Tf c Control siRNA1 Figure 5 Combinatorial effects of flotillin - 1 siRNA and dynamin - 2 – K44A .

Two separate combinations of siRNAs against flotillin - 1 were suf - ficient to cause a specific reduction in flotillin - 1 expression to less than 25 % of control levels ( Fig . 4a , and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . There was no change in clathrin expression or total transfer - rin uptake per cell , although the distribution of transferrin - positive endosomes was slightly altered ( Fig . 4b ) . To assay the rates of clathrin - independent budding from the plasma membrane , we measured the proportion of CTB - positive , internalized vesicles that did not colocal - ize with transferrin after 1 min of uptake in COS - 7 cells . Internalized CTB was detected by two protocols : alternate labelling of total and surface - accessible pools of CTB ( Figs 4c , d ) and use of low pH washes ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . 4b ) , as described above ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a , and related text ) . Two separate flotillin - 1 siRNAs both caused a reduction in the pool of CTB that did not colocalize with transferrin , as detected using either of these pro - tocols ( Fig . 4e ) . This implies that the rate at which clathrin - independ - ent endocytic structures bud into the cell is dependent on flotillin - 1 expression . To confirm that this effect is not due to off - target effects of the siRNAs , we expressed flotillin - 1 – GFP in COS - 7 cells in which endogenous flotillin - 1 expression had been inhibited using siRNAs that targeted the 3 ' - untranslated region ( UTR ) of flotillin - 1 mRNA ( Fig . 4f ) . As expected , the pool of CTB - positive structures that does not colocal - ize with transferrin was restored to control levels ( 90 ± 25 per cell in cells expressing flotillin - 1 – GFP , 26 ± 9 per cell in neighbouring cells ) . Internalization of antibody against the GPI - linked protein CD59 was used as a second assay for clathrin - independent endocytosis in HeLa cells 3 , 4 . As shown in Fig . 1 , internalized anti - CD59 antibody colocalizes with flotillin - 1 . The kinetics of total uptake of CD59 across a popula - tion of siRNA - treated cells was followed by use of western blotting to detect internalised antibody after acid washing . Quantification using a fluorimetric blot scanner confirmed that the rate of CD59 uptake was approximately 50 % of control levels ( Fig . 4g ) . Therefore , reduction in flotillin - 1 expression causes a significant drop in uptake in two separate assays for clathrin - independent endocytosis , in two different cell lines . Dynamin is thought to be required for budding of both coated - pits and caveolae 10 , 26 , 27 , but several reports highlight the existence of a further endocytic pathway that is not blocked by overexpression of a domi - nant - negative mutant of dynamin - 2 , K44A 1 , 3 , 4 , 28 , 29 . If flotillin - 1 functions during dynamin - 2 – K44A - resistant endocytosis , then dominant - negative dynamin and flotillin - 1 siRNA should have additive effects on the total uptake of CTB . To test this hypothesis , we expressed dynamin - 2 – K44A in siRNA - transfected cells . Prolonged ( > 36 h ) expression of dynamin - 2 – K44A in flotillin - 1 siRNA - transfected cells caused the cells to become rounded up and to exhibit multiple membrane blebs ( not shown ) . Sixteen hours of dynamin - 2 – K44A expression , however , was sufficient to block transferrin uptake without inducing major morphological changes . As shown in Figs 5a and b , the combination of dynamin - 2 – K44A and flo - tillin - 1 siRNA was sufficient to reduce CTB uptake to less than 30 % of control levels in those cells in which transferrin uptake was completely blocked , whereas dynamin - 2 – K44A alone had a much less strong effect 1 . There was , moreover , a strikingly high degree of colocalization between internalized CTB and flotillin - 1 – GFP in dynamin - 2 – K44A - expressing cells ( Fig . 5c ) , confirming that most of the dynamin - independent endo - cytosis of CTB takes place via flotillin - 1 - positive structures . The data presented in this paper support the conclusion that clathrin , caveolin - 1 and flotillin - 1 define three separate types of region within the plasma membrane that can all undergo internalization . Whether flotillin - 1 plays a direct mechanistic role in vesicle morphogenesis or budding remains to be ascertained , and it remains possible that flotil - lin - 1 is a cargo that is recognized by separate endocytic machinery . The existence of flotillin - 1 - containing microdomains has been suggested previously , but their dynamics and function have been unclear 7 , 8 , 12 , 15 . The relationship between flotillin - 1 - containing regions of the plasma membrane and lipid microdomains , or rafts , is unclear . Both CTB - and GPI - linked proteins are found in biochemically defined lipid rafts 30 , 31 , but we did not detect enrichment of these markers in flotillin - 1 - con - taining regions . Both CTB - and GPI - linked proteins can enter multiple endocytic pathways , and the extent to which uptake in flotillin - 1 - con - taining regions involves efficient sorting or concentration of membrane components remains to be investigated fully . Identification of further protein components will help to address these questions . The homolo - gous protein flotillin - 2 could be detected with a specific antibody , and exhibited partial colocalization with flotillin - 1 ( not shown ) 7 . There have been some reports that flotillin - 1 colocalizes with caveolin - 1 , but these findings are disputed and we saw no such colocalization 7 , 8 , 15 , 16 . It is likely that there are additional endocytic mechanisms , such as the macropinocytotic events associated with membrane ruffles and activation of ARF6 ( ref . 32 ) . The patterns of inter - connection between different endocytic pathways that are likely to occur after uptake may well be complex and variable . We have observed that a block in the recruitment of clathrin to the plasma membrane by overexpression of AP180 - C causes an apparent increase in caveolar endocytosis 20 ( B . J . N . , unpublished observations ) . Earlier studies also highlight how a block in one type of endocytosis will probably lead to upregulation of alterna - tive pathways 28 . This emphasizes the difficulty in unravelling functional contributions . Nevertheless , the positive identification of flotillin - 1 - dependent endocytosis should greatly facilitate further studies that address these important questions . METHODS Materials .

For western blot and total protein analysis , samples were run in Novex pre - cast 4 – 20 % gradient Tris - glycine gel ( Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) ; for protein separation , larger 12 . 5 % Tris - glycine gels were used . Western blotting was carried out using a Trans - Blot semi - dry transfer cell and an Odyssey infra - red imager . Identification of proteins was carried out using a Voyager DE - STR MALDI - TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a reflector analyser . DNA constructs . Cav1 – GFP , Clath – CFP , Dyn2K44A , ARF6T27N and Cdc42S17N have been described elsewhere 3 , 9 , 25 , 26 . The murine flotillin - 1 gene was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) - amplified from the IMAGE clone AV2 - D11 using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers Fl1dir ( 5 ′ - TAGCTCGAGCCATGTTTT TCACTTGTGGCC C - 3 ′ ) and Fl1revN ( 5 ′ - CTAGAATTCCGGCTGTTCTCAAA GGCTTGTGA - 3 ′ ) . The PCR product was then cloned into pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech , Oxford , UK ) using Xho I and EcoR I sites , yielding F1 - GFP . RNA interference . Cells were grown in four - well LabTek chambered cover - slips ( Nalge Nunc , Napersville , IL ) , and transfected with duplex RNA oligonu - cleotides using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Transfection on day 1 was repeated on day 2 ; endocytosis assays were carried out on day 4 . In experiments that assessed the combination of Dyn2K44A and siRNA , Dyn2K44A transfection was carried out on the evening of day 3 . RNA oligonucleotides to conserved regions in human and murine flotillin - 1 with the sequences UGAGGCCAUGGUGGUCUCCdTdT and CACACUGACCCUCAAUGUCdTdT were prepared as duplexes with overhang - ing dTs ( Dharmacon , Lafayette , CO ) and were used in combination as siRNA1 . siRNA 2 was obtained from Santa Cruz ( Santa Cruz , CA ) , catalogue number sc - 35391 . For the rescue experiment , two duplex oligonucleotides against the 3 ′ UTR of flotillin - 1 were used in combination : CACAGAUGCCCAGCCUCAUAGdTdT and UAGUUUGUGCCUUGUCUUGAAdTdT . Cell imaging . Cells were transfected using FuGENE6 12 – 16 h before the experi - ment . For labelling of endogenous flotillin - 1 in HeLa cells , cells were fixed for 20 min in 2 % formaldehyde and then 5 min in methanol at – 20 ° C . After further permeabilization with 0 . 2 % saponin , monoclonal antibodies against flotillin - 1 were used at 2 . 5 µg ml – 1 and were detected with appropriate secondary antibod - ies . In endocytosis experiments , cells were incubated with fluorescently labelled endocytic markers on ice for 15 min before warm - up to 37 ° C for the indicated times , fixed with 2 % formaldehyde and stained with antibodies as described 5 . All confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope with standard filters for FITC / TRITC / Cy5 - type fluorophores ( 488 nm excitation , emission at 505 – 530 nm ; 543 nm excitation , emission at 560 – 600 nm , 633 nm excitation , emis - sion at > 650 nm , respectively 5 ) . Where confocal images are presented as three - channel overlays , the contrast in the images has been enhanced . TIR imaging was carried out as described previously 33 . Cells were plated onto dedicated Olympus coverslips with an appropriate refractive index 12 – 16 h before imaging and viewed with an Olympus APO100X OHR 1 . 65 NA oil - immersion objective at 30 ° C . Image analysis . TIR movies obtained at 1 Hz of flotillin - 1 – GFP , caveolin - 1 – GFP and clathrin - light - chain - B – GFP were analysed using the program Diatrack 3 . 0 ( Semasopht , Switzerland ) . This allowed counting and tracking of puncta . The validity of the tracking algorithm was confirmed by visual inspection . Structures that could not be tracked for more than 3 s were not included in further analysis . We found that budding events , defined as a > 50 % decrease in normalized fluo - rescence intensity over 2 s , could not be reliably scored using automated software , due to fluctuations in the overall image intensity . Therefore , we scored these events by comparing images taken 20 s apart by overlaying them in red and green channels with Adobe Photoshop , using the overlay to identify structures that dis - appeared during that time , and then referring back to the raw data ( image stacks ) to confirm that the relevant structure had , indeed , apparently budded rather than just translocated laterally in the plane of the membrane , and that the structure had previously persisted at the plasma membrane for at least 3 s . At least four separate movies , each covering > 1 min real time , were analysed for each parameter . Endocytosis assays . To detect early endocytic intermediates , cells grown to approximately 50 % confluence and transfected with the appropriate GFP con - struct using FuGENE6 in LabTek chambered coverslips were either : Cooled on ice , labelled with 1 µg ml – 1 CTB - Cy3 ( 1 µg per well of a six - well plate ) , warmed to 37 ° C by exchange with pre - warmed medium without labelled ligand , fixed but not permeabilized after 1 min and , after washing with PBS , labelled with 5 µg ml – 1 CTB – Cy5 ( 5 µg per well of a six - well plate ) ; or cooled on ice , labelled with 1 µg ml – 1 CTB – Cy3 , warmed to 37 ° C by exchange with pre - warmed medium without labelled ligand and then washed four times in ice - cold 150 mM glycine at pH 2 . 0 before fixation . To quantify colocalization images , thin confocal sections were contrast - enhanced to allow counting of the number of vesicles containing a specified combination of markers ( for example , only CTB compared with CTB plus transferrin ) for at least five cells in any one experiment . Anti - CD59 antibody uptake by HeLa cells was assayed in two different ways . In all experiments , the antibody was used at 0 . 5 µg ml – 1 . The first method used non - internalized monoclonal anti - CD59 antibody after binding on ice , which was removed after 15 min of uptake by washing with 150 mM glycine at pH 2 . 0 , as above , before fixation , permeabilization and staining with Cy5 - conjugated secondary antibody . The second method involved an assay of antibody uptake in a population of cells : the antibody was bound to HeLa cells on ice , cells were warmed for the times indicated , non - internalized antibody was removed by wash - ing with 150 mM glycine at pH 2 . 0 , cells were lysed in SDS – PAGE sample buffer and , following SDS – PAGE , the samples were transferred to nitrocellulose . The blots were probed with an Alexa680 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody and the amount of internalized monoclonal antibody was measured using an Odyssey infra - red gel imager . Internalized ( acid - wash - resistant ) antibody was expressed as a proportion of the amount of total antibody bound to the cells , as detected by omitting the low pH wash step . Electron microscopy . For immuno - gold labelling of cryosections , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 250 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 2 at 37 ° C , embedded in 10 % gelatin and infused with 1 . 7 M sucrose / 15 % poly - vinyl pyrolidone and prepared as previously described 34 . Ultra - thin frozen sections were collected from the knife - edge with 2 % methyl cellulose and 2 . 3 M sucrose in a ratio of 50 : 50 and immunolabelled using sequential labelling 35 , contrasted , dried and observed in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope .
