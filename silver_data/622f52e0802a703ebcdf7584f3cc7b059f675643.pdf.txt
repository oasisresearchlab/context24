It has also advanced efforts in developing human induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPSC - CMs ) as a promising human model for studies of heart structure and function . hiPSC - CMs have key physiological differences from primary human cardiomyocytes ( CMs ) , including lower sarcomere alignment and contractility , smaller area and lower aspect ratio , and lower force production . Protein micropatterning has been demonstrated to make hiPSC - CMs behave more like primary human CMs across these metrics . However , these micropatterned models typically use only extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and have not investigated whether providing a protein associated with CM - CM interactions , such as N - cadherin , further enhances hiPSC - CM structure and function . Here , we developed a novel dual - protein patterning process to geometrically control single - cell CM placement on deformable hydrogels suitable for traction force microscopy ( TFM ) . The patterns were comprised of rectangular laminin islands for attachment across the majority of the cell area , with N - cadherin “end - caps” imitating cell - cell interactions . We first photopatterned two proteins on a glass coverslip using a two - step process with photomolecular adsorption of proteins . After both photopatterning steps were complete , we transferred the pattern from the coverslip to a physiologically relevant ~ 10 - kPa polyacrylamide hydrogel . We seeded α - actinin - tagged hiPSC - CMs on the dual - protein - patterned hydrogels and verified interaction between the hiPSC - CMs and the N - cadherin end - caps via immunofluorescent staining . We found hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns have a higher cell area and contractility in the direction of sarcomere organization than those on laminin - only patterns , but no difference in sarcomere organization or force production . While N - cadherin modestly improves the single - cell patterned hiPSC - CM model , it is not sufficient to replicate the role of cell - cell contacts in CM development for in vitro hiPSC - CM systems . Introduction Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPSC - CMs ) are a promising model to bridge the gap between human heart function and the studies of the human heart in animal models [ 1 - 4 ] . Developments in cardiomyocyte ( CM ) differentiation protocols have expanded the use of hiPSC - CMs in research [ 5 ] and engineering interventions have helped overcome limitations to the use of hiPSC - CMs as models for primary human CMs . These limitations include differences in structure and function between hiPSC - CMs and adult human CMs , such as CM morphology , sarcomere organization , and contractile force [ 4 , 6 ] . Cardiac organoids or engineered heart tissues ( EHTs ) offer one approach to improving hiPSC - CM structure and function on average [ 7 - 10 ] . EHTs are commonly composed of hiPSC - CMs supported via some scaffolding , often made of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins with mechanical properties similar to the myocardium [ 7 ] . EHTs mimic the 3D , multicellular environment of human CMs , and exhibit improved structure and function in hiPSC - CM – with sarcomere length and alignment similar to adult human CMs [ 9 , 10 ] . However , EHTs require large numbers of hiPSC - CMs and supporting cells , show considerable heterogeneity in cell size and shape , and their complexity impedes live - cell imaging of subcellular structures , preventing investigations of sarcomere dynamics [ 6 ] . While EHTs provide a more realistic tissue environment for hiPSC - CMs , single hiPSC - CMs are prominently used in studies that seek to investigate intracellular processes , including assessments of cardiotoxicity in pre - clinical drug studies [ 11 - 14 ] . These studies use single - cell hiPSC - CMs to assess changes in contractile dynamics and ion channel function to investigate common and dangerous side effects of drugs before entering into clinical trials [ 11 - 14 ] . For this reason , developing better single - cell hiPSC - CMs is an important goal that could facilitate lower cost and higher throughput drug screening assays . Protein micropatterning on hydrogels mimicking the mechanical properties of the myocardium provides an engineering approach to improve the structure and function of hiPSC - CM for single - cell assays [ 15 , 16 ] . Protein micropatterning allows for the control of hiPSC - CM morphology by culturing the cells on rectangular ECM protein patterns in aspect ratios greater than or equal to 5 : 1 , similar to the aspect ratio of adult human CMs [ 1 , 15 - 17 ] . Patterned hiPSC - CMs present more highly aligned myofibrils and greater contractile forces than unpatterned hiPSC - CMs [ 16 ] . With these single - cell hiPSC - CMs , we have a high degree of control over the microenvironment and can study sarcomere dynamics and , by including fiducials in the deformable substrate , we can dynamically monitor force production . Protein micropatterning has been used with a range of cell types to control cell shape and to create organized arrays of cells that allow for high - throughput imaging and analysis [ 18 , 19 ] . Additionally , patterned cells have been shown to be more highly reproducible , creating more consistent intracellular phenotypes [ 18 - 20 ] . Théry and colleagues found that protein micropatterning of human retinal pigment cells created less intercellular variability and greater control over internal organization of the cells [ 18 ] . Tseng , et al . found that cell - cell junction positioning of mammary epithelial cells could be controlled by varying the spatial organization of ECM protein micropatterns [ 19 ] . Additionally , Rothenberg , et al . found that varying geometries of ECM protein micropatterns affected the number and organization of focal adhesions [ 20 ] . The reproducibility and higher control over subcellular organization are important benefits of the single - cell hiPSC - CM model , especially when screening for changing phenotypes , such as in drug studies [ 11 , 12 , 14 ] . Previous studies have investigated the effects of protein micropatterning on hiPSC - CMs , primarily focusing on the ECM proteins . A few studies have investigated CM - CM interactions using N - cadherin - functionalized substrates , culturing rat CMs on N - cadherin - coated polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels [ 21 ] and N - cadherin - patterned glass [ 22 ] . Chopra , et al . coated PA hydrogels with N - cadherin , using anti - Fc antibody as a linking protein and stabilizing the proteins on the hydrogel with the crosslinker sulfo - N - sulfosuccini - midyl - 6 - ( 4’ - azido - 2’ - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( Sulfo - SANPAH ) [ 21 ] . They then cultured single - cell rat CMs on the N - cadherin - coated hydrogels and found that the CMs produced traction force with a similar magnitude as single - cell rat CMs on ECM proteins [ 21 ] . Additionally , they showed that N - cadherin - mediated mechanotransduction is distinct from ECM - mediated mechanotransduction [ 21 ] . In another study , Chopra and colleagues patterned single - cell rat CMs on N - cadherin patterns on glass to learn that alpha - catenin serves as an adapter protein for N - cadherin - mediated mechanotransduction [ 22 ] . While these studies have provided useful insight into the role of N - cadherin in CM mechanotransduction , their translatability is limited because they are in rat CMs , which have key physiological differences compared to human CMs [ 23 , 24 ] . Some studies have investigated the role of N - cadherin in the heart using single - cell , multicellular , and whole animal models from rats , mice , cats , and chicks [ 25 - 27 ] . Goncharova , et al . found that blocking N - cadherin inhibits the development and organization of sarcomeres in in vitro single - cell rat and chick CMs cultured on glass [ 25 ] . Additionally , Simpson and colleagues showed that cell - cell contacts are necessary for in vitro feline CMs cultured on laminin - coated petri dishes to stabilize myofibrils and to beat on their own [ 26 ] . In a whole animal study , Wu and colleagues showed that N - cadherin and integrin - mediated stabilization of myofibrils occur independently during development [ 27 ] . These previous in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that N - cadherin is relevant to CM structure , function , and development [ 21 , 22 , 25 - 27 ] . These studies used cells from animal models , limiting the relevance to the human heart . Additionally , all but one [ 21 ] used non - physiologic stiffness substrates and could not monitor CM contractile dynamics . Here , we bridge these gaps using single - cell hiPSC - CMs on protein - patterned deformable hydrogels suitable for traction force microscopy ( TFM ) . The single - cell hiPSC - CM model allows us to investigate the impact of N - cadherin adhesions in human CM structure , including subcellular structures like sarcomeres , but also their contractile function . Here , we asked whether pattering both laminin ( an ECM protein secreted by CMs and abundant in their native microenvironment ) and N - cadherin improves the structure and function of single - cell hiPSC - CMs . To answer this , we developed a method for consistent and precise dual - protein patterning on deformable hydrogels , and tested the effects of these substrates on single - cell hiPSC - CMs . N - cadherin is a relatively short ( 130 kDa ) , asymmetric protein which requires rotational freedom for proper conformation and binding [ 28 ] . To ensure the covalent attachment of functional N - cadherin , we adapted a protocol from Sarker , et al . [ 29 ] for the covalent attachment of Protein A as a linker to bind N - cadherin with an Fc - domain [ 30 ] . We used our protein micropatterning method to imitate both CM - ECM and CM - CM interactions for single - cell hiPSC - CMs . We hypothesized that utilizing the dual - protein patterning to imitate CM - ECM and CM - CM interactions would improve hiPSC - CM structure , e . g . , cell spread area , sarcomere alignment , and contractile function , i . e . , sarcomere contractility and force production . Results and Discussion We created two single cell patterns : i ) single protein patterns consisting of laminin rectangles , and ii ) dual protein patterns , consisting of laminin rectangles flanked by N - cadherin caps ( Figure 1a ) . We patterned arrays of alternating single and dual protein patterns on each coverslip . We then transferred the protein patterns to a ~ 6 . 8 - kPa polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogel . We verified the patterning and the pattern transfer to PA hydrogel using a laminin antibody and a pan - cadherin antibody ( Figure 1a ) . Finally , we seeded hiPSC - CMs on the patterns ( Figure 1b ) and assessed their morphology , force production , and sarcomere organization and contractility on the laminin - only and dual - protein patterns .

Mechanical characterization of polyacrylamide hydrogels We used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to characterize four polyacrylamide hydrogels ( Figure 2 ) . Using the Hertz model ( Figure 2a ) , we found the mean stiffness of the polyacrylamide hydrogels to be 6 . 8 kPa , with a standard deviation of 1 . 5 kPa . We used multiple AFM cantilevers due to PA hydrogel build - up on cantilever tips after ~ 10 - 20 measurements . The three cantilevers had the following properties : ( 1 ) r t = 10μm , k c = 0 . 184N / m , sensitivity = 0 . 047V / nm , ( 2 ) r t = 10μm , k c = 0 . 060N / m , sensitivity = 0 . 027V / nm , and ( 3 ) r t = 3 . 46μm , k c = 0 . 191N / m , sensitivity = 0 . 042V / nm . We compared the data from each cantilever using a Kruskal – Wallis one - way analysis of variance test to ensure that the results were consistent . There was no statistically significant difference between any of the data sets , including the data set containing all of the datapoints together ( p - values between 0 . 44 and > 0 . 9999 ; Figure 2b ) .

Validation of hiPSC - CM interaction with N - cadherin on dual - protein patterns We first sought to verify that the hiPSC - CMs were interacting with the N - cadherin end - caps on the dual - protein patterns . We stained hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns with a pan - cadherin primary antibody and AlexaFluor - 647 secondary antibody . We manually outlined each cell in FIJI ( ImageJ ) as described in Methods . We outlined the N - cadherin end - cap using the 647 channel ( N - cadherin ) . We isolated the overlap between the cell outline and the N - cadherin end - cap and quantified the average fluorescence intensities in the overlap area and the N - cadherin end - cap area ( Figure 3a ) . We compared the two conditions using a two - tailed Wilcoxon matched - pairs signed rank test . We observed a significant difference ( p < 0 . 0001 ) between the intensity of N - cadherin signal where the hiPSC - CMs overlapped the N - cadherin patterns and the intensity of the N - cadherin patterns themselves ( Figure 3b ) . This overlap confirms that the hiPSC - CMs localized endogenous N - cadherin on the in vitro N - cadherin patterns . Figure 3 . Dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs have greater cell area than those on laminin - only patterns .

Scale bar is 20 μm . hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns have increased cell area and attachment rates To investigate the effect of dual - protein patterns on hiPSC - CM structure , we assessed cell area and aspect ratio , as well as the rate of attachment of hiPSC - CMs to laminin - only and dual - protein patterns . Most studies that pattern hiPSC - CMs use rectangles with an aspect ratio of 5 : 1 to 7 : 1 , corresponding to the range of adult human ventricular CMs [ 1 , 16 , 17 ] . In early experiments , we used patterns with an aspect ratio of 7 : 1 , but found most cells did not fill the entire pattern , meaning many did not reach the N - cadherin end - caps on the dual - protein patterns . We adjusted the length of the patterns to address this issue , bringing our pattern aspect ratio down to ~ 6 : 1 . The cell area and aspect ratio of the hiPSC - CMs were assessed by drawing an outline of the cell in FIJI , as described in Methods . The areas of hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns were larger than those of laminin - only patterns , with average areas of 824 . 4μm 2 and 739 . 9μm 2 , respectively ( P = 0 . 0023 ; Figure 3d ) . For reference , the total pattern area is 1190μm 2 . The mean aspect ratios of hiPSC - CMs on the laminin - only and dual - protein patterns were 5 . 4 and 5 . 5 respectively ( Figure 3d ) . The laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs had a larger variance than the dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs , with standard deviations of 1 . 21 and 0 . 96 , respectively ( F - test p = 0 . 0085 ) . The mean aspect ratios were compared using an unpaired , two - tailed T - test with Welch’s correction and had no significant difference ( P = 0 . 8705 ) . These results confirm that both laminin - only and dual - protein patterns support spreading of hiPSC - CM near the patterned aspect ratio . In addition to hiPSC - CM area and aspect ratio , we considered whether the addition of N - cadherin end - caps influenced the rate of cell attachment . To determine attachment rates , we counted the number of single - cell hiPSC - CMs attached to each pattern type . For this data , we included all cells on dual - protein patterns , regardless of whether they overlapped an N - cadherin end - cap or not . We assessed the difference in attachment rates using a parametric , two - tailed , ratio paired T - test . The rate of attachment was higher on dual - protein patterns than laminin - only patterns , with average attachment rates of 5 . 5 % and 4 . 3 % , respectively , on seventeen total devices ( P = 0 . 0441 ; Figure 3c ) . This increased attachment suggests that dual - protein patterns may promote increased hiPSC - CM attachment rates , even if the hiPSC - CMs didn’t overlap the N - cadherin end - caps at the time of fixation / imaging . hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns have increased contractility in the direction of sarcomere alignment To investigate the effect of dual - protein patterns on hiPSC - CM function , we analyzed the contractility of the hiPSC - CM sarcomeres . Sarcomeric contractility is a commonly used metric to compare hiPSC - CMs to adult human CMs , with adult human CMs exhibiting greater contractility than hiPSC - CMs [ 1 , 4 , 16 ] . We analyzed sarcomere contractility and organization using a previously published , open - source program called Sarc - Graph [ 31 ] . Sarc - Graph segments videos of fluorescently - tagged sarcomeres in beating hiPSC - CMs and outputs parameters representing the orientation , spacing , and contractility of the sarcomeres , all of which are important metrics for hiPSC - CM structure and function [ 31 ] . In overall sarcomere shortening , we did not see a significant difference between hiPSC - CMs on laminin - only vs dual - protein patterns ( Figure 4a ) . The percent shortening is calculated by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum length for an individual sarcomere and dividing it by the average length of the sarcomere [ 31 ] . The percent sarcomere shortening for all of the sarcomeres in one cell are averaged to calculate a single percent sarcomere shortening for each hiPSC - CM . The mean percent sarcomere shortening for laminin - only and dual - protein patterns were not significantly different , with values of 16 . 89 % and 17 . 67 % , respectively ( P = 0 . 6273 ) . To further investigate sarcomere contractility , we assessed C | | , a parameter calculated by Sarc - Graph that relates sarcomere contractility to sarcomere alignment and represents the shortening of the entire cell domain in the direction of dominant sarcomere orientation [ 31 ] . To define C | | , we first need to understand how Sarc - Graph defines sarcomere alignment . Zhao , et al . use a structural tensor to quantitatively assess the sarcomere orientation , defining the structural tensor with the equation 𝕋 = 〈2 [ 𝑟 𝑥 𝑖 𝑟 𝑥 𝑖 𝑟 𝑥 𝑖 𝑟 𝑦 𝑖 𝑟 𝑦𝑖 𝑟 𝑥𝑖 𝑟 𝑦𝑖 𝑟 𝑦𝑖 ] − [ 1 0 0 1 ] 〉 where r = [ r ix , r iy ] is a unit vector representing the orientation of the i th sarcomere [ 31 ] . The structural tensor has eigenvalues of a max and a min , with a max providing the magnitude of sarcomere alignment ( OOP ) . The eigenvectors of the structural tensor are v max and v min , with v max representing the direction of sarcomere alignment [ 31 ] . To define the contractility , Zhao and colleagues define the deformation gradient D avg with the equation 𝐃 avg 𝚲 0 = 𝚲 where Λ 0 = [ v 01 , v 02 , … , v 0 n ] , representing the vectors v that connect neighboring sarcomeres in the initial reference frame , and Λ = [ v 1 , v 2 , … , v n ] , representing the vectors v connecting neighboring sarcomeres in the current deformed frame [ 31 ] . Zhao , et al . relate the deformation gradient back to the sarcomere alignment expressions with the equation 𝐯 max = 𝐃 avg 𝐯 0 [ 31 ] , where v max is the eigenvector representing the direction of sarcomere alignment in the contracted ( deformed ) state and v 0 representing the direction of sarcomere alignment in the relaxed ( initial ) state [ 31 ] . They then define C | | as 𝐶 | | = | 𝐯 0 | − | 𝐯 max | | 𝐯 0 | , representing the fractional shortening of the sarcomeres in the direction of sarcomere alignment [ 31 ] . We found that hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns had larger C | | values , with an average of 0 . 041 compared to 0 . 029 for laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs ( P = 0 . 0294 ; Figure 4a ) . This result suggests that the contractility of the sarcomeres along the long axis of the myofibrils is enhanced in hiPSC - CMs patterned with N - cadherin end - caps mimicking CM - CM interactions . We determined the statistical significance with an unpaired T - test with a Welch’s correction for the unequal variance ( F - test P = 0 . 0403 ) in the dual - protein - patterned data ( standard deviation = 0 . 026 ) compared to the laminin - only - patterned data ( standard deviation = 0 . 019 ) . Figure 4 . Dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs have higher contractility in the direction of sarcomere organization , but no difference in sarcomere alignment compared to laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs .

( b ) OOP and mean sarcomere length for hiPSC - CMs on laminin - only ( right ) and dual - protein ( left ) patterns . For both laminin - only and dual - protein patterned conditions , n = 39 . For all plots , centerlines indicate medians , dotted lines indicate 25 th and 75 th percentiles . P - values with significance at P < 0 . 05 are designated with ( * ) . hiPSC - CM sarcomere organization is similar on laminin - only and dual - protein patterns We further examined the impact of dual - protein patterning on hiPSC - CM structure by analyzing sarcomere structure and organization . Previous studies have suggested that adult CMs have average sarcomere lengths of ~ 2 . 2 μm , while immature CMs have average sarcomere lengths of ~ 1 . 6 μm [ 1 ] . To investigate sarcomere structure and organization , we assessed hiPSC - CM sarcomere lengths and the orientational order parameter ( OOP ) , a metric commonly used to assess sarcomere organization in CMs that ranges from zero ( random orientation ) to 1 ( perfectly aligned ) [ 31 ] . We hypothesized that hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns would have more highly organized sarcomeres because previous studies found that N - cadherin is important in sarcomere formation and organization [ 21 , 22 , 25 - 27 , 32 ] . Surprisingly , sarcomeric organization , as assessed via the OOP , was not significantly different between hiPSC - CMs on laminin - only and dual - protein patterns , with average values of 0 . 6330 and 0 . 6254 , respectively ( P = 0 . 6205 ; Figure 4b ) . The lack of difference in sarcomere organization between laminin - only and dual - protein patterned hiPSC - CMs suggests that the patterned N - cadherin end - caps are not sufficient to increase organization . We also found no difference between the mean sarcomere lengths of hiPSC - CMs on laminin - only and dual - protein patterns . Both groups had mean sarcomere lengths of 1 . 8 μm , with minimum and maximum sarcomere lengths of 1 . 7 μm and 2 μm , respectively ( P = 0 . 6193 ; Figure 4b ) . We assessed the statistical significance using an unpaired T - test with a Welch’s correction because the standard deviations of the laminin - only and dual - protein data , 0 . 10 μm and 0 . 14 μm , respectively , were significantly different ( F - test p = 0 . 0408 ) . hiPSC - CM force production is similar on laminin - only and dual - protein patterns To further investigate the impact of dual - protein patterning on hiPSC - CM function , we assessed force production of hiPSC - CMs with Traction Force Microscopy ( TFM ) , using the streamlined TFM module of a custom , open - source code called CONTRAX [ 33 , 34 ] . The streamlined TFM module of CONTRAX provides a user - friendly TFM analysis tool that reads in fluorescent microbead displacement videos and assesses a number of functional metrics , including traction force [ 33 - 35 ] . We looked at multiple parameters output by CONTRAX , including total force production , peak traction stress , average contraction displacement , and contraction velocity . We also assessed total contractile moment , which is a scalar value representing the sum of moments taken at the center of the cell [ 36 ] , and total impulse , which is the integrated area under the curve from the force versus time plot [ 33 ] . Force production , average contraction displacement , and contraction velocity are all directly related to hiPSC - CM contractility and are commonly used to assess CM function [ 16 , 37 , 38 ] . The peak traction stress avoids the homogenization caused by integrating over the cell area , providing insight into the maximum stress produced by each cell . Total force production is calculated by integrating the traction stresses over the cell area at each time point , creating a trace of force versus time , and identifying the maximum amplitude of the trace peaks [ 33 - 35 ] . To assess average contraction displacement , CONTRAX averages the displacement magnitudes over the cell area for each video frame . CONTRAX then creates a one - dimensional trace of average displacement over time and extracts the displacement between the fully contracted and fully relaxed states [ 33 , 34 ] . CONTRAX calculates the contraction velocity using the same displacement versus time trace , dividing the contraction displacement by the time elapsed during contraction [ 33 , 34 ] . Peak traction stress is extracted by identifying the timepoint with greatest traction stress and reporting the highest absolute value of traction stress within that timepoint . The total contractile moment provides information about the distribution of stresses by weighting the traction forces by their distance from the cell center . We hypothesized that the force production of hiPSC - CMs might be more concentrated at the N - cadherin end - caps compared to the hiPSC - CMs on laminin - only patterns . The contractile moments are calculated by multiplying the traction force by the distance from the cell center , using the equation 𝑀 𝑖𝑗 = ( 1 2 ) ∫ 𝑑 2 𝑟 [ 𝑥 𝑖 𝑇 𝑗 ( 𝑟⃗ ) + 𝑥 𝑗 𝑇 𝑖 ( 𝑟⃗ ) ] = − ( 𝑖 2 ) [ 𝜕𝑇 𝑗 ̃ ( 𝑘⃗⃗ ) 𝜕𝑘 𝑖 + 𝜕𝑇 𝑖 ̃ ( 𝑘⃗⃗ ) 𝜕𝑘 𝑗 ] | 𝑘⃗⃗ = 0 where 𝑇⃗⃗ ( 𝑟⃗ ) is the traction vector at point 𝑟⃗ on the hydrogel surface [ 36 ] . The second expression represents the equation in Fourier space , which we operate in when using Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry ( FTTC ; see Methods ) . The tilde indicates the two dimensional Fourier transform with wave vector 𝑘⃗⃗ [ 36 ] . Using x and y for indices i and j , we have four possible equations representing scalar values : M xx , M yy , M xy , and M yx . M xy and M yx represent torque on the substrate due to the traction forces , and M xx and M yy represent contractile forces weighted by their distance to the center of the cell [ 36 ] . To investigate the weighted contribution of x - and y - forces to the cell contraction , we assess the total contractile moment by adding the x - and y - contractile moments together : 𝜇 = 𝑀 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑀 𝑦𝑦 [ 36 ] . The total impulse is calculated by calculating the area under the force versus time trace [ 33 , 39 ] . It is equivalent to the tension - integral parameter used in a previous study that found that hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies could be differentiated in hiPSC - CMs by the tension - integral magnitude [ 39 ] . We did not expect to see a difference in total impulse between our two conditions , but assessed the parameter to verify that there was no difference . For all of these parameters except for average contraction displacement and contraction velocity , we used the peak measurements , meaning the values calculated when the cell is either fully contracted or fully relaxed . Our analysis tools assume these are quasi - static states ; however , we note this assumption is violated during active contraction or relaxation occurring across all frames of our ~ 800 frame videos . We did not find significant differences between total force , peak stress , average contraction displacement , contraction velocity , total contractile moment , or total impulse ( Figure 5 ) . This result is consistent with the overall contractility result , further indicating that the difference in functional outputs of hiPSC - CMs on laminin - only and dual - protein patterns are modest . Within both laminin - only and dual - protein pattern conditions , we saw a large variance in force production , as can be seen in Figure 5a . For the laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs , the mean force was 104 . 1nN + / - 98 . 2nN , while the dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs had an average force of 118 . 3nN + / - 107 . 1nN . Figure 5 . Dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs demonstrate no difference in ( a ) total force , ( b ) peak traction stress , ( c ) total contractile moment , ( d ) total impulse , ( e ) average contraction displacement , and ( f ) contraction velocity compared to laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs . For all data in this figure , N = 81 with n = 35 for laminin - only and n = 46 for dual - protein condition . For all plots , centerlines indicate medians , dotted lines indicate 25 th and 75 th percentiles . All of the parameters reported by CONTRAX , including those assessed above , are single scalar values for each cell . These parameters allow for quantification of force production but result in the loss of spatial information of hiPSC - CM contractility . This flattening of spatially distributed forces into scalar values is necessary to quantify and assess data sets that consist of ~ 800 frames per video and hundreds of displacement data points in each frame of each video . While the scalar outputs provide quantifiable comparisons between cells , the spatial information can contain differences in force distribution that are not discernible in scalar variables . To investigate the spatial distribution of force production for each condition , we averaged the peak contraction traction stress heatmaps of all the cells in each condition ( Figure 6 ) , with 34 cells in the laminin - only condition and 46 cells in the dual - protein condition . We visually see a difference between the traction stresses in the laminin - only - and dual - protein - patterned conditions , with the peak stresses appearing to occur closer together in dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs compared to laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs . The inward shift in peak traction stress location for the hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns could be reflecting the inward shift of the laminin pattern boundary compared to the laminin - only patterns . The red squares in Figure 6a indicate the location of the N - cadherin end - caps and the peak traction stresses occur within the laminin portion of the dual - protein patterns . This suggests that the focal adhesions still drive the traction force production in hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns . Additionally , we see lower traction stresses in the laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs compared to the dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs . While the location of peak traction stress appears to have moved toward the cell center , the area of the peak traction stress is larger in dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs compared to laminin - only - patterned hiPSC - CMs . The areas of peak traction stress for the laminin - only patterns on the left and right are 170 μm 2 and 155 μm 2 , respectively . For the dual - protein patterns , the areas of peak traction stress on the left and right are 310 μm 2 and 292 μm 2 , respectively . This could suggest that while the mechanotransduction occurs near the edge of the laminin pattern , the hiPSC - CMs on dual - protein patterns are establishing mechanical connections to the patterns with larger areas .

Conclusions In this work , we have developed a method for precise patterning of multiple proteins on a single device and applied this method to create patterns mimicking cell - cell and cell - ECM interactions for hiPSC - CMs . Our method applies a novel dual patterning method to functional cellular studies . We have demonstrated the use of the method by making dual - protein patterns to mimic cell - cell interactions for single - cell hiPSC - CMs . Our results indicate that our dual - protein patterning increases hiPSC - CM attachment rates , spread area , and the efficiency of sarcomere contraction along myofibrils . We found no significant difference in force production , overall sarcomere contractility , and sarcomere organization between laminin - only and dual - protein patterned hiPSC - CMs , suggesting that N - cadherin end - caps offer modest benefit alone . More complexity is likely necessary to improve hiPSC - CM structure and function beyond single ECM patterning alone . In addition to greater complexity in the patterning approach , more detailed spatial analysis of force production and sarcomere contractility could provide more insight into the differences between laminin - only and dual - protein - patterned hiPSC - CMs . Detailed spatial analysis is made difficult by the high quantity of data – there are almost 2 , 000 data points per frame , 800 frames per cell , and ~ 40 cells per condition . In addition to the high volume of data , the data are heterogeneous , with variations in the time point of peak contraction for each cell as well as variations in cell area and cell location in relation to the pattern . Methods Protein patterning glass coverslips N - cadherin is an asymmetric protein and a linking protein is necessary to ensure the extracellular binding site is available when patterning N - cadherin [ 30 , 40 , 41 ] . In this work , we used an N - cadherin Fc chimera ( R & D Systems , 1388 - NC - 050 ) and a 546 - nm fluorescently tagged Protein A ( ThermoFisher , P11049 ) as our linking protein . Protein A is a protein with a high affinity to Fc - regions of IgG molecules [ 42 ] . It has been previously used to ensure the correct orientation of E - cadherin [ 41 , 43 ] . The Fc region of the N - cadherin chimera protein binds to the Protein A , ensuring the correct orientation of the N - cadherin on the device surface . To begin protein micropatterning , we activated 18mm diameter # 1 glass coverslips with oxygen plasma for 5 minutes at 18W ( Harrick , PDC - 32G ) . Immediately after plasma treatment , we sealed an 8mm inner diameter silicone ring ( B & J Rubber Products ) to the center of the glass coverslip . The silicone ring was cut from a Silhouette CAMEO 3 electronic desktop cutter ( Silhouette America ) . We immediately pipetted a solution of 100 µg / mL of poly ( l - lysine ) - graft - poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PLL ( 20 ) - g [ 3 . 5 ] - PEG ( 2 ) ; SuSoS AG ) diluted in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ; Gibco , ThermoFisher , 10010049 ) within the ring and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature . We rinsed the PLL - g - PEG thoroughly ( 10x ) with PBS prior to micropatterning . Following PLL - g - PEG incubation and rinsing , we pipetted 20μL of UV sensitive photoinitiator ( PLPP ; Alvéole ) into the silicone ring on the glass coverslip . Then we placed the glass coverslip on the stage of a Leico Dmi8 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Fluotar 20x / 0 . 40 NA objective and the Alvéole Primo photopatterning system ( Alvéole ) with a 375 nm , 7 . 10 mW laser . We made digital masks for the protein A “end - cap” patterns as well as the main laminin patterns using the open - source software Inkscape ( https : / / inkscape . org ) . We used the pixel - to - micron ratio generated by Primo calibration to define the geometries of all patterns . We defined two patterns for constraining the single - cell hiPSC - CM : 1 ) 14 µm x 85 µm laminin - only patterns ; and 2 ) 14 µm x 85 µm dual - protein patterns . Dual protein patterns are comprised of Protein A end - cap patterns ( 14 µm x 10 µm ) overlapped with laminin rectangles ( 14 µm x 69 µm ) by ~ 10 % to mitigate any alignment artifacts . We loaded the digital masks into the Leonardo plugin ( Alvéole Laboratory ) on Micro - Manager software [ 44 ] , and made a 6 by 6 array with 150 µm spacing between each instance of the patterns . We illuminated the glass coverslip with the first digital mask for the Protein A end - caps at a dosage of 1 , 000 mJ / mm 2 . Following micropatterning , we rinsed off the photo initiator with PBS and incubated the glass coverslip with 100 µL of a 100 µg / mL solution of 546 - nm fluorescently tagged Protein A overnight at 4 °C . We then thoroughly rinsed the Protein A from the glass coverslip using PBS and added another 20 µL of PLPP photoinitiator . We illuminated the glass coverslip with the second digital mask for the laminin rectangles at a dosage of 1 , 000 mJ / mm 2 . We designed the array of patterns to alternate between dual - protein and laminin - only patterns . Before UV illumination , we aligned the shortened laminin bodies within the digital mask to the already - patterned protein A end - cap patterns using a Texas Red fluorescent excitation filter . Following this second UV illumination step , we rinsed off the photoinitiator with PBS and incubated the glass coverslip with a 500 µg / mL solution of laminin ( Corning , 354232 ) for 2 hours at room temperature . For pattern verification experiments , we incubated the glass coverslip with a 500 µg / mL solution of green fluorescent laminin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . , LMN02 ) for 2 hours at room temperature . Finally , we rinsed the patterns with PBS and removed the silicone containment ring prior to gel transfer . A schematic of the protein micropatterning process flow can be seen in Figure 7a . Figure 7 . Dual - protein patterning of PA hydrogels . ( a ) Process flow of dual - protein patterning on a glass coverslip using photomolecular adsorption . ( b ) Process flow of transfer of dual - protein pattern from glass coverslip to PA hydrogel and incubation of N - cadherin . ( c ) Schematic of final result – alternating laminin - only and dual - protein patterns on PA hydrogel . Preparation of polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels In preliminary work , the Protein A—N - cadherin complex could not anchor hiPSC - CMs on unfunctionalized polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels ( Figure S2 ) , so we employed oxidized N - Hydroxyethyl acrylamide ( oHEA ) to create a covalent bond between the hydrogel and the Protein A . We transferred the laminin and Protein A patterns to a ~ 10kPa oHEA - functionalized PA hydrogel before adding N - cadherin , to ensure that the final hydrogel presented the N - cadherin binding domain on the hydrogel surface . We prepared the oHEA - functionalized PA hydrogels following a previously published protocol with some modifications [ 29 ] . Briefly , we began by oxidizing N - Hydroxyethyl acrylamide ( HEA ; Sigma , 697931 ) by adding 0 . 01 g of sodium metaperiodate ( Sigma , 71859 ) to 2 . 338 mL of HEA , then incubating in the dark on a shaker for 4 hours . To adhere the PA hydrogels to the glass bottom dishes used in this work , we treated the glass with bind - silane . We prepared a solution with 95 μL of 100 % ethanol , 50 μL of acetic acid , and 3μL of 3 - ( Trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( Bind - silane ; Sigma , M6514 ) . Then , we treated the glass with oxygen plasma for 30 seconds at 18W ( Harrick , PDC - 32G ) . Directly after plasma treating the glass , we added ~ 50 μL of the bind - silane solution to the glass surface . We incubated the solution on the glass for 1 minute , after which we removed the excess bind - silane solution . We left the remaining solution to react for 10 minutes , after which we rinsed the glass twice with 1 mL of 100 % ethanol and dried with nitrogen gas . To prepare the PA hydrogel solution , we combined 732 μL of 40 % Acrylamide solution ( Bio - Rad , 1610140 ) and 260 μL of 2 % Bis - acrylamide solution ( Bio - Rad , 1610142 ) with 4 . 008 mL MilliQ water . For experiments used in TFM analysis , we added 326μL of 1 . 0 μm - diameter blue fluorescent microbeads ( ThermoFisher , F8814 ) and decreased the MilliQ volume to 3 . 682 mL to maintain the total volume of 5mL . Finally , we added 200μL of oxidized HEA , bringing the total volume to 5 . 2 mL . Separately , we prepared a 10 % weight by volume ( w / v ) solution of ammonium persulfate ( APS ; Sigma , A9164 ) in MilliQ water . To begin polymerization , we added 2 . 6 μL of N , N , N′ , N′ - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ; Sigma , 411019 ) and 260 μL of the 10 % w / v APS solution to the PA solution . We gently mixed the solution with a P1000 pipette and then pipetted 35μL of the solution onto the bind - silane - treated glass surface . We then placed a protein patterned coverslip on top of the solution , sandwiching the PA solution between the bind - silane - treated glass and the protein patterned glass . After casting , the hydrogel polymerized in the dark for 30 minutes before we hydrated it with PBS and left it to fully polymerize at 4°C for 6 - 8 hours . After full polymerization , we removed and discarded the protein patterned top coverslip . A schematic of the protein transfer to oHEA - functionalized PA hydrogel can be seen in Figure 7b . Following the removal of the top coverslip , we aspirated the PBS from the dish and incubated each PA hydrogel with ~ 50 μL of 100 μg / mL N - cadherin ( R & D Systems , 1388 - NC - 050 ) for 3 hours at 4˚C . After 3 hours , we washed the PA hydrogel three times with 1mL PBS and then stored it overnight at 4°C in PBS with 10 % Antibiotic - Antimycotic 100X ( Anti - Anti ; Gibco , ThermoFisher , 15 - 240 - 062 ) and 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; ThermoFisher , PI37525 ) . The following day , we washed the hydrogel three times with 1 mL PBS and then stored it in PBS + 10 % Anti - Anti until cell seeding . A schematic of the final device can be seen in Figure 7c . We verified the patterning and the pattern transfer to PA hydrogel using green fluorescent laminin ( as described in Protein patterning glass coverslips ) and a pan - cadherin primary antibody ( Sigma , C3678 ) . We diluted the pan - cadherin antibody 1 : 200 in PBS and incubated on the devices for 1 hour at room temperature . We washed the devices three times with PBS and then incubated the devices with anti - rabbit AF - 647 diluted 1 : 500 in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature . We rinsed the devices three times with PBS and then imaged ( Figure 1a ) . Stiffness characterization by Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) We characterized our PA hydrogel stiffness using AFM indentation based on a previously published protocol [ 45 ] . Briefly , we used a WITec AFM ( Alpha300 ) and large tip cantilevers with tip radii of curvature ( r t ) of 3 . 46 μm and 10 μm and nominal spring constants ( k c ) of 0 . 191 N / m ( 3 . 46 μm tip – Bruker , SAA - HPI ) and 0 . 184 N / m and 0 . 191 N / M ( 10 μm tip – Bruker , SAA - SPH - 10UM and MLCT - SPH - 10UM ) . We measured four hydrogels , assessing 3 locations per hydrogel with between 2 - 3 measurements per location . Each hydrogel was measured 2 days after polymerization . The PA hydrogels were attached to a glass bottom dish and submerged in PBS . We measured Optical Lever Sensitivities [ 46 ] before each experiment by performing force - distance scans against the glass surface of a glass bottom plate using the following parameters : feedback control with 1 . 0 V set point , 1 % p - gain , and 0 . 2 % i - gain , force - distance using 0 . 2 μm pull and 0 . 6 μm push at 0 . 2 μm / s speed . After determining the Optical Lever Sensitivity , we loaded the PA hydrogel sample and centered the cantilever above a point on the hydrogel . We then approached the surface using the following parameters : 1 . 0 V set point , 1 % p - gain , and 0 . 2 % i - gain . We then performed the force - distance curve measurement using WITec’s Distance Curve mode with approach and retract distances of 20 μm and 10 μm , respectively , at a speed of 3 μm / s . We analyzed the force - distance curves using the Hertz model [ 47 ] , with the assumption that the PA hydrogel is linearly elastic . Stem cell culture and cardiomyocyte differentiation For this work , we used human induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPSC - CMs ) . The hiPSCs were GFP - tagged alpha - actinin - 2 ( cell line 75 ) developed at the Allen Institute for Cell Science ( allencell . org / cell - catalog ) and available through Coriell ( AICS - 0075 - 085 ) [ 48 , 49 ] . We cultured the hiPSCs on tissue culture plastic coated in Matrigel ( Corning , 356252 ) using feeder - free culture conditions in standard conditions of 5 % carbon dioxide at 37°C . The hiPSCs were cultured in Essential 8 Medium ( Gibco , ThermoFisher , A1517001 ) which was changed daily . We passaged the cells with EDTA when confluency reached 75 % . We differentiated the hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes ( hiPSC - CMs ) using a previously published protocol [ 50 ] and maintained the hiPSC - CMs until seeding in RPMI 1640 Medium ( ThermoFisher , 11875119 ) with B - 27 Supplement ( B27 ; ThermoFisher , 17504044 ) . We seeded the hiPSC - CMs on devices at a density of ~ 100 , 000 cells / cm 2 between day 24 - 30 and imaged 3 - 4 days after seeding ( day 27 - 34 ) . Microscopy We performed all microscopy with a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 inverted microscope with a high speed camera ( Photometrics Prime 95b ) and a water immersion 40X objective ( Plan Apochromat , 1 . 2 NA ) . The microscope was equipped with an incubation chamber ( PeCon ) that maintained a temperature of 37°C and 5 % CO 2 during live - cell imaging . Before live - cell imaging , we changed the media from B27 to B - 27 Supplement in RPMI 1640 Medium , no phenol red ( ThermoFisher , 11835030 ) with 10mM HEPES and 1 % Anti - Anti . For each cell , we took a still image in brightfield , 405 ( fluorescent microbeads ) , 488 ( alpha - actinin ) , and 546 ( Protein A ) . We used the still images in the 546 channel to determine whether the cell was on a laminin - only or dual - protein pattern . After the still images , we recorded ~ 10 second long videos of sarcomeres ( 488 channel ) and fluorescent microbeads ( 405 channel ) . The frame rate was ~ 40 frames per second for the sarcomere videos and ~ 80 frames per second for the microbeads videos . For the data presented in this work , unless otherwise noted , we included only cells that overlapped at least one N - cadherin end - cap in the dual - protein datasets . Sarcomere contractility quantification We acquired sarcomere shortening videos using alpha - actinin - tagged hiPSC - CMs ( as described in Methods ) . After collecting a video , we cropped it in FIJI ( ImageJ ) [ 51 ] and applied the “Subtract Background” tool with a rolling ball radius of 5 pixels . We then adjusted the brightness and contrast in FIJI using the “auto” option and saved the video as an AVI with a 40 frames per second frame rate . To quantify the average alignment , sarcomere length , sarcomere shortening , and radial contraction , we ran the videos through Sarc - Graph , a previously published , open - source code that segments the images and tracks sarcomere alignment and contraction [ 31 ] . Traction force microscopy We utilized CONTRAX , a custom , open source workflow that acquires images and videos , then analyses fluorescent bead displacements using an Ncorr tracking module on pairwise frames from videos of beating hiPSC - CMs to generate matrices of spatiotemporal displacement field data [ 33 , 34 ] . The traction force microscopy ( TFM ) module in CONTRAX uses the displacements to calculate traction stresses . The traction stresses are then integrated over the area of the cell to determine the total traction force produced by the cell [ 33 ] . We first uploaded bead displacement videos ( ~ 800 frames each ) and their corresponding brightfield still images into CONTRAX . For each video , we drew the outline of the cell in FIJI using a composite image of the brightfield and 488 still images of the cell . We saved the cell outline as an ROI and loaded it into CONTRAX with the corresponding bead displacement video ( Figure 8a ) . CONTRAX uses the cell outline to isolate the forces produced by the cell from background noise . The size of the area around the cell included in the analysis can be set using the “mask parameters” in CONTRAX . Force production is calculated from bead displacements , so we can expect to see forces slightly outside of the cell outline due to the cell deforming the gel at the cell boundary , causing bead displacements outside the cell outline , as can be seen in Figure 8a . To capture the forces at the cell boundary , while excluding background noise , we adjusted the “area factor” and “scale factor” in the “mask parameters” section of CONTRAX . After outlining the cell , CONTRAX calculates an ellipse that best fits the outline . The area included in the analysis is equal to the best fit ellipse times the “area factor” , so a larger “area factor” equals a larger analyzed area . The “scale factor” controls the aspect ratio of the analysis region ellipse , with a “scale factor” of greater than 1 increasing the aspect ratio and a “scale factor” of less than 1 decreasing the aspect ratio . In this work , we chose an analysis region “area factor” of 3 and a “scale factor” of 0 . 75 . The area factor of 3 allows us to capture the forces just outside the cell boundary as described above , while excluding much of the noise around the cell , as can be seen in Figure 8c . The “scale factor” of 0 . 75 ensures the analysis region stays within the frame , especially with long , thin cells . After loading the cell outline , we input the material properties for the PA hydrogel the cell was on . For this study , all the cells were cultured on PA hydrogels with a Young’s modulus of ~ 6 . 8 kPa . The Poisson’s ratio for PA hydrogels is generally accepted to be between 0 . 45 and 0 . 5 [ 52 - 54 ] , and in this work , we used a Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 45 . These parameters are used in the force calculation with the assumption that the gel is linearly elastic and homogenous , which is a generally accepted approximation when the strain on the hydrogel is very small ( less than 1 ) , as it is in TFM [ 53 ] . Additionally , we assume that the gel is thick enough and wide enough to prevent the cells from experiencing any boundary effects of the gel and that all cell - produced forces normal to the hydrogel surface are negligible . These assumptions are approximately true given that the hydrogel is ~ 10 times as thick as the cell height [ 55 ] and are generally accepted assumptions for traction force microscopy [ 53 , 55 , 56 ] . After the video initialization , we set the displacement parameters for the Ncorr displacement tracking module . We used a subset radius of 30 px , spacing coefficient of 10 px , cutoff norm of 1e - 6 , and cutoff iteration of 20 . These parameters are used to optimize the bead tracking in Ncorr , minimizing the amplification of noise and the loss of information due to over - smoothing . Using the resulting displacement maps at each timepoint ( Figure 8b ) , CONTRAX calculates the regularization parameter , lambda , based on L - curve optimization [ 57 ] . The regularization parameter constrains the accepted force vectors , minimizing the error due to noise and the error due over - smoothing . Finally , using this regularization parameter , CONTRAX calculates the traction force heatmaps for each timepoint ( Figure 8c ) using Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry ( FTTC ) [ 36 , 58 ] .

Cell fixation and immunostaining Following live cell imaging , we fixed the hiPSC - CMs with 4 % formaldehyde ( ThermoFisher , 28908 ) for 10 minutes . Then we washed the cells with PBS three times and stored them in PBS at 4°C until immunostaining . Before antibody incubation , we incubated the cells for 5 minutes with a permeabilization solution of 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( ThermoFisher , A16046 . AE ) in PBS . We then incubated them with a blocking solution of 0 . 3 % Tween20 ( ThermoFisher , 28352 ) and 2 % BSA in PBS for 30 minutes . We diluted a pan - cadherin primary antibody ( Sigma , C3678 ) 1 : 200 in a solution of 0 . 1 % Tween20 and 1 % BSA in PBS ( dilution buffer ) . We incubated the hiPSC - CMs with the pan - cadherin antibody solution for 1 hour at room temperature , then washed three times with dilution buffer . We diluted anti - rabbit AF - 647 secondary antibody ( ThermoFisher , A - 32733 ) 1 : 500 in dilution buffer and incubated on the cells for 1 hour at room temperature . We washed the cells three times with PBS and then stored in PBS at 4°C until imaging .
