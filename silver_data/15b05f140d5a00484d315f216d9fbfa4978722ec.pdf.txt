However , how actin assembly forces are harnessed has not been fully revealed for any vesicle forming process . In this study , three - dimensional ( 3D ) super - resolution microscopy , live - cell imaging of triple - genome - edited , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) , and newly developed machine - learning - based computational analysis tools , were used to comprehensively analyze assembly dynamics and geometry of proteins representing three different CME functional modules . When hundreds of CME events with and without associated Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin network assembly were compared , sites with actin assembly showed a distinct delay between completion of endocytic coat expansion and vesicle scission , consistent with the notion that these were stalled sites requiring actin assembly forces to complete vesicle formation . Importantly , our analysis showed that N - WASP is preferentially recruited to one side of CME sites , where it stimulates actin assembly asymmetrically . These results indicate that in mammalian cells actin assembly is induced at stalled CME sites , where asymmetric forces pull the plasma membrane into the cell much like a bottle opener pulls off a bottle cap . Main Formation of clathrin - coated vesicles requires forces to first bend the membrane into a sphere or tube , and to then break the thin neck that connects the vesicle to the plasma membrane . These forces are generated through the combined actions of proteins that directly bend the membrane and actin filament assembly 3 – 5 ( Fig . 1a ) .

In yeast cells , where turgor pressure is particularly high , super - resolution data suggest that actin assembles symmetrically around CME sites and indicate that actin regulators including Las17 , yeast WASP , is present in a ring surrounding the base of the clathrin coat 6 . However , studies on mammalian cells raised the possibility that actin assembly may at least in some cases be initiated asymmetrically at clathrin coats 7 – 9 . Which CME sites assemble actin , and how actin networks are organized with respect to CME sites , has not been determined systematically , in a large - scale , unbiased manner , particularly in live mammalian cells . This information is essential to understanding how and why actin assembly forces are harnessed for CME . To investigate the physiological roles and spatiotemporal regulation of actin assembly at CME sites in mammalian cells , we applied genome - editing techniques to generate a human iPSC line ( hereafter referred to as ADA cells ) that co - expresses a TagRFP - T fusion of the mu1 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex ( AP2M1 ) , a TagGFP2 fusion of dynamin2 ( DNM2 ) , and a HaloTag fusion of the ARPC3 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex as representatives of the CME coat , scission and actin modules respectively 3 , 10 , 11 ( Fig . 1a , Extended Data Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Video 1 , 2 ) . Previous studies showed that endogenously tagged AP2M1 , DNM2 and ARPC3 can serve as reliable markers of these CME functional modules that avoid disruption of physiological spatiotemporal organization of the process as might be caused by overexpression of fluorescently labeled proteins 12 – 15 . We observed dynamic CME events on the basal plasma membrane of the genome - edited cells using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) .

At the early stage of CME , a relatively small amount of DNM2 is recruited to CME sites . Shortly before the end of a CME event , the DNM2 recruitment rate increases rapidly with DNM2 levels reaching a peak concomitant with vesicle scission 10 , 15 , 18 ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) . This later rapid - recruitment phase represents the assembly of dynamin helix on the highly curved neck of the budding vesicle after the U to Ω shape transition of the endocytic membrane 15 , 18 – 21 . We analyzed how actin networks are organized at CME sites in both fixed and live cells . First , we performed two - color 3D Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy ( STORM ) imaging 22 on fixed ADA cells , localizing either AF647 phalloidin - labeled actin filaments 23 or HaloTag - fused ARPC3 at CME sites . Due to the dense phalloidin labelling of cortical actin filaments under plasma membrane , it was often challenging to unambiguously identify the CME - specific actin structures in iPSCs . However , in regions with thinner cortical actin layers , we observed that actin was typically distributed asymmetrically around CME sites ( Fig . 1b and Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . Antibody labeling of ARPC3 - Halotag in the ADA cells had the advantage of a less complex staining pattern . Besides being highly concentrated in lamellipodia , ARPC3 was associated with CME sites asymmetrically , like actin ( Fig 1c and Extended Data Fig . 2b ) . These data indicate that ARPC3 can be used to study Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly at CME sites as a more specific maker of branched actin networks than a general actin label . We next used ADA cells to investigate actin assembly at CME sites in live cells , which has several advantages over studies in fixed cells . During the fixation and subsequent sample preparation , actin structures may not be faithfully preserved . In addition , in fixed cells it is very difficult to identify the stage of the CME , so the timing , geometry and dynamics of actin assembly cannot be related to the endocytic stage .

By visualizing endogenously tagged AP2M1 to mark the initiation of CME , and DNM2 to mark scission , together with ARPC3 to specifically label Arp2 / 3 - nucleated , branched actin filaments ( Fig . 1a ) , we were able to precisely study the spatial and temporal regulation of actin assembly during CME . Using TIRF live - cell imaging , we observed ARPC3 - labeled branched actin networks at lamellipodia and a subpopulation of CME sites ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Dynamic actin assembly and disassembly occurred at CME sites with different spatio - temporal characteristics , including discrete CME sites , clathrin plaques and at clathrin coat splitting sites , as previously reported 7 ( Fig . 2c and Extended Data Fig . 3a , b ) . In the analysis described below , we focus on the discrete CME events and not the more complex ones ( plaques and splitting events ) . Quantitative analysis of these events with 1s / frame temporal resolution revealed that ARPC3 is mainly recruited during the late stages of CME with similar timing to the rapid recruitment stage of DNM2 14 ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Interestingly , we observed clear spatial displacement between ARPC3 ( actin module ) and AP2 ( coat module ) before and after vesicle scission ( Fig . 2c ) . Imaging fluorescent beads using the same settings indicates that the displacement is not an artifact caused by misalignment between different imaging channels ( Supplementary Video 3 and Extended Data Fig . 3c ) . To analyze the intrinsic recruitment order and timing for up to three endocytic proteins at CME sites quantitatively and systematically , we developed a high - throughput method that does not involve any manual selection of CME sites , which is prone to bias ( see Materials and Methods ) . Briefly , AP2 tracks were identified using standard particle - tracking algorithms 24 . was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

The AP2 and DNM2 tracks were decomposed into dynamic features describing the events’ position and brightness . These features were used for clustering via unsupervised machine learning , which enabled grouping of similarly - behaved tracks ( Extended Data Fig . 4a and b ) . DNM2 - positive events were refined by a detection scheme that determined the number of DNM2 peaks using various characteristics of a single DNM2 - peak : the peak height , width , and minimum peak - to - peak distance ( Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . Events with a single DNM2 peak were analyzed as described below . The method detects low signals from endogenously tagged CME proteins , such as the low - level recruitment of DNM2 at the early stages of CME , and accurately reveals the different CME stages ( Extended Data Fig . 4d ) . Next , the timing of actin network assembly at CME sites was determined using ARPC3 as a branched actin filaments marker by analyzing over one thousand CME events . Although actin appearance early in CME has been reported 7 , determining the actin assembly timing is challenging because actin dyes lack the specificity required to distinguish newly assembled branched actin at CME sites from the nearby cortical actin filaments or actin filaments attached to other vesicles or organelles . Also , whether actin functions during the early stage of CME has not yet been shown conclusively due to the potential side effects such as changes in membrane tension caused by actin inhibitors . Our endogenous ARPC3 tagging approach sidesteps these problems . We classified ARPC3 positive CME events into two groups : one with ARPC3 appearance early in CME and the other late in CME ( Fig . 3a ) . We observed that in most of the events ( N = 1 , 385 , 67 . 8 % ) a sharply increasing ARPC3 signal appears with similar timing to the rapid - recruitment phase of DNM2 concomitant with the U to Ω membrane shape transition . This timing is consistent with previously proposed role for actin in membrane invagination , as studies was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

In some cases ( N = 657 , 32 . 2 % ) we detected ARPC3 signals at early CME stages . To test whether random overlap between nearby actin structures and CME sites might be responsible for the apparent early actin recruitment , we generated a randomized data set by pairing ARPC3 images with AP2 and DNM2 images from an unrelated movie ( Fig . 3b ) . In this data set , we detected early “assembly” of actin in the majority of ARPC3 positive CME events ( N = 17 , 282 , 72 . 9 % ) , and the intensity profiles of these events resembled the early - actin CME events we observed in the real data set ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Therefore , we conclude that the presence of actin early in CME is very likely due to unrelated nearby actin structures overlapping with CME sites . Our live - cell analysis allowed the timing of branched actin network assembly to be compared to the scission timing , and the spatial offset between the clathrin coat and the associated actin network to be determined . Super - resolution imaging of yeast CME sites suggested that actin and actin nucleators localize symmetrically in a ring around CME sites , and computational modeling suggested that an asymmetric actin arrangement would not provide sufficient force for the membrane invagination during yeast CME 6 . In contrast , in mammalian cells , which require less actin force production during CME , imaging of fixed cells suggested that actin structures associate adjacent to apparent flat clathrin coats . However , these studies proposed that at the later CME stages the actin structures become larger and more symmetric to provide sufficient force for membrane deformation and scission 7 , 8 . Surprisingly , in our live cell studies designed to highlight sites of new actin assembly , we observed off - centered branched actin networks at CME sites throughout even the latest CME stages ( Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , most ARPC3 - positive CME sites accomplish scission within 30s from the initiation of ARPC3 recruitment ( Fig . 3c ) .

This observation is consistent with the observation that ring - shaped actin structures at clathrin coats were rarely observed in the high - resolution , live - cell imaging in a previous study 26 . In total , these live - cell data suggest that in mammalian cells , asymmetric actin network assembly can provide enough force to assist membrane deformation and scission during the late stages of CME . To gain new insights into the function of this asymmetric actin network assembly , we quantitatively compared CME events with or without ARPC3 recruitment . We observed that about 30 % of CME events are completed in the absence of detectable actin assembly , which is consistent with the hypothesis that in mammalian cells actin assembly is required for CME only under relatively high membrane tension , which can vary regionally within cells 9 , 25 . Consistent with the possibility that increased membrane tension stalls membrane deformation during CME 5 , 27 , 28 , CME lifetimes were markedly longer for ARPC3 positive events compared to the ARPC3 negative events ( Fig . 4a ) . In addition , when the AP2M1 intensity vs time profiles were compared between ARPC3 positive and negative CME sites , a plateau , which lasts for approximately 10 seconds , was observed for the ARPC3 positive events ( Fig . 4b ) . Based on these observations and previous experimental and computational modeling data 5 , 9 , 25 , we propose that this plateau in branched actin - positive CME events represents stalled membrane bending due to an unfavorable local membrane environment , such as higher membrane tension 5 , 27 , 28 . We hypothesized that the asymmetric actin network might affect the lateral movements of endocytic coats on the plasma membrane . Interestingly , the ARPC3 positive CME sites showed significantly slower , but more directional lateral movement before the scission compared to the ARPC3 negative CME sites ( Fig . 4c , d ) . After scission both ARPC3 positive and negative vesicles showed fast , apparently random movements ( Fig . 4c , d ) .

To further explore how the asymmetrical assembly of actin networks at CME sites is regulated , we endogenously tagged N - WASP , an actin nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) that plays roles in CME , in AP2M1 - tagRFP - T / DNM2 - tagGFP2 genome - edited iPSCs ( hereafter referred to as ADW cells , Fig . 5a and Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . In these cells , N - WASP was recruited asymmetrically to CME sites at the late stage ( Fig . 5b - d and Extended Data Fig . 5b , c ) . Longer lifetimes and a plateau in the AP2 intensity vs time plot were observed specifically in the N - WASP positive CME events ( Extended Data Fig . 5d , e ) . These data indicate that asymmetric NPF recruitment underlies the asymmetric architecture of branched actin networks at CME sites . Using large - scale , comprehensive analysis of thousands of CME sites , our study demonstrates that in mammalian cells coat assembly dynamics predict which sites will assemble actin , and show that at apparently stalled sites , actin assembles asymmetrically to facilitate successful vesicle formation . Based on the data presented here , we propose an updated model of actin assembly at mammalian CME sites ( Fig . 5e ) : ( 1 ) Where the local membrane tension is lower , ( Fig . 5e upper scenario ) the membrane can undergo flat - U - Ω shape transitions without actin assembly in a relatively short time . When the coat grows large enough to form a Ω - shaped bud , sufficient dynamin can be recruited to perform scission , and there is little delay between coat expansion and scission ; ( 2 ) Where the local membrane tension is high and the coat protein - membrane interaction does not generate sufficient force to curve the membrane , extra force generation from actin assembly is required 5 , 25 . Asymmetric N - WASP recruitment activates actin nucleation mostly at one side of the clathrin coat , generating an asymmetric force that pulls the membrane was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

We speculate that this asymmetrical force generates asymmetric membrane deformation at endocytic sites observed by high - speed atomic force microscopy 29 and may twist the clathrin pit to promote scission at the neck . CME events with associated actin assembly have longer lifetimes , likely due to a delay between coat expansion and scission , requiring adaptive recruitment of actin regulators followed by actin network assembly and membrane remodeling . Under the cell culture conditions used in this study , we observed asymmetric actin assembly at CME sites in living mammalian cells , which is different from the symmetric actin structures observed at CME sites in yeasts 6 , which grow under high turgor pressure and require actin assembly for membrane invagination 30 . However , interestingly , a recent study has shown that when the membrane tension is increased artificially , actin coverage over the clathrin coat is increased at CME sites in mammalian cells as well 9 . This observation , together with our new data , suggests that actin assembly at CME sites undergoes conserved but highly adaptive regulation in yeasts and mammalian cells . Asymmetric actin assembly is the default mode when a relatively small amount of force is sufficient to drive membrane remodeling . However , adaptive mechanisms result in assembly of larger or more symmetric actin structures that provide larger amounts of force to counter high membrane tension or turgor pressure . Future computational modeling studies of how asymmetric actin network assembly provides forces for vesicle formation and membrane remodeling will deepen our understanding of actin ' s functions in a host of actin - mediated processes . Our model provides further insights into the basis for inconsistent effects of actin drugs on CME 7 , 12 , 25 , 30 – 35 .

Global disruption of actin dynamics is expected to dramatically change membrane tension and therefore to have both direct and indirect effects on CME . The results presented here also provide considerations relevant to the constant coat area vs constant coat curvature models for how the clathrin coat assembles and develops curvature . In the constant area model , flat clathrin coats grow close to their final size before becoming curved into a vesicle . In the constant curvature model , clathrin coats grow with a fixed curvature . These two models of CME are under active debate 27 , 36 – 39 . Our observations suggest that coat expansion and curvature generation may be regulated via distinct mechanisms , with different actin requirements . Our data show that at actin - positive CME sites , actin assembles at the late stage of CME when coat assembly is mostly completed ( Fig . 3d and Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . In the constant curvature model , we would find actin - associated clathrin coats in only highly curved dome and spherical shapes ( Extended Data Fig . 6b ) . However , actin - associated flat or shallow clathrin coats have been observed in multiple studies 8 , 9 , which supports the constant area model at actin - positive CME sites ( Extended Data Fig . 6c ) . Mathematical modeling predicts that at actin - negative CME sites , where coat proteins provide sufficient force to bend the membrane 23 , the membrane smoothly evolves from a flat to budded morphology as the coat area increases 5 , which supports constant curvature model . Therefore , in the future studies , the constant coat area and constant coat curvature models need to be tested separately on a single type of CME event . was not certified by peer review ) is the author / funder .

Cultures were passaged with Gentle Cell Dissociation reagent ( StemCell Technologies , Cat # : 100 - 0485 ) twice every week . Genome - editing The AP2M1 gene was edited in WTC10 hiPSCs as previously described using TALENs targeting exon 7 of the AP2M1 gene ( 1 ) . Both alleles of AP2M1 were tagged with tagRFP - T . The Cas9 - crRNAtracrRNA complex electroporation method was used sequentially to edit DNM2 and ARPC3 gene in AP2M1 - tagRFP - T genome - edited hiPSCs , as previously described ( 2 , 3 ) . The same method was used to edit the WASL gene in AP2M1 - tagRFP - T / DNM2 - tagGFP2 genome edited hiPSCs . S . pyogenes NLS - Cas9 was purified in the University of California Berkeley QB3 MacroLab . TracrRNA and crRNA that target CCTGCTCGACTAGGCCTCGA ( DNM2 ) , CCTGGACAGTGAAGGGAGCC ( ARPC3 ) and AGCTCATGGTTTCGCCGGCG ( WASL ) , were purchased from IDT .

Clones were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the genomic DNA locus around the insertion site . Both alleles of DNM2 and ARPC3 were tagged with tagGFP2 and HaloTag , respectively , and one allele of WASL was tagged with HaloTag in the hiPSC lines used in this study . Western blotting Cells were dissociated from the well using Gentle Cell Dissociation reagent ( StemCell Technologies , Cat # : 100 - 0485 ) . Total proteins were extracted by adding 1ml of cold 10 % TCA to the cell pellets , incubated on ice for 30min , and spun down by centrifuging at 4 °C , 12000rpm for 10min . Protein pellets were dissolved in loading buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 5 % BME , 5mM DTT and protease inhibitor ) and loaded onto an acrylamide gel for SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting .

Cells were imaged on a Nikon Ti - 2 inverted microscope fitted with TIRF optics and a sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Cells were maintained at 37 °C with a stage top incubator ( OKO Lab ) in StemFlex medium with 10mM HEPES . Images were acquired with Nikon Elements . Channels were acquired sequentially at a 1 sec interval and 300ms exposure time over 4 minutes . TIRF image processing Four generalized processing steps were applied identify of clathrin - coated pits with single DNM2 peaks : track feature abstraction , feature dimensionality reduction , event clustering , and DNM2 - peak detection . First , tracks that are defined by fitted positions and intensities for single events were generated using cmeAnalysis ( 5 ) . Then , AP2 and DNM2 tracks were decomposed into dynamic features describing the dynamics of the events’ position and brightness . The mapping of each track to discrete features was done to generalize the dynamics of tracked events into a set of interpretable coordinates . These features were clustered after feature scaling to normal distributions , dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis , and Gaussian mixture modeling . DNM2 - positive events represented a distinct cluster of tracks that had detectable DNM2 throughout the event , were long lived , and were below the threshold of motility expected for transient , non - CME - derived clathrin - coated vesicle “visitors” at the TIRF field . Single DNM2 - peak events were found by searching over a range of values set for the minimum DNM2 peak height , width , and peak - to - peak temporal distance . After finding single - peaked events in a fixed peak - parameter combination , the lifetime distribution of single peak events’ lifetimes were fit to the expected underlying distribution , a Rayleigh distribution ( 6 ) , where the best - fitting parameter combination was chosen to identify single - peaked events .

Two - color 3D STORM imaging 12 mm round coverslips were sonicated in distilled water and sterilized for 20 min in 70 % ethanol , air - dried and coated with Matrigel in 24 - well plates . Cells were seeded onto Matrigel - coated coverslips two days before fixation . For clathrin and actin two - color imaging , cells were fixed first for 1 min in 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde ( GA ) solution containing 0 . 25 % ( v / v ) Triton in cytoskeleton buffer ( CB : 10mM MES , 150mM NaCl , 5mM EGTA , 5mM Glucose , 5mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , pH 6 . 1 ) and then immediately fixed for 20 min in 2 % ( v / v ) GA solution in CB . Both solutions were prepared fresh from a 10 % GA stock ( Electron Microscopy Science , cat # 16120 ) . After fixation , samples were incubated twice for 5 min in freshly prepared 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) NaBH4 in PBS . For clathrin and ARPC3 - HaloTag imaging , cells were fixed for 20 min in 4 % ( v / v ) PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Cat # : 15710 ) in CB . Subsequently , both types of samples were washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS . Samples were then blocked for 20 min in blocking buffer [ 3 % ( w / v ) BSA and 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) Saponin in PBS ] . Clathrin light chain ( Invitrogen , Cat # : MA5 - 11860 , 1 : 200 dilution ) and Halotag ( Promega , Cat # : G9281 , 1 : 200 dilution ) antibodies were used in blocking solution . Primary antibody immunostaining was performed overnight at 4°C . On the next day , samples were washed three times in washing buffer ( 0 . 1x blocking buffer in PBS ) for 10 min .

Homemade mouse secondary antibody - CF680 ( 1 : 50 ) was used to stain clathrin and actin samples . Commercial mouse secondary antibody - AF647 ( ThermoFisher , cat # A32787 ; 1 : 400 ) and homemade rabbit secondary antibody - CF680 ( 1 : 50 ) were used to stain the clathrin and ARPC3 - HaloTag . Clathrin and actin samples were then stained with 0 . 5µM Phalloidin - AF647 ( Fisher Scientific , Cat # : A22287 ) in PBS and kept at room temperature in the dark for 2 hours . Samples were washed three times with PBS before STORM imaging . STORM imaging was performed as previously described on a homebuilt STORM setup ( 7 , 8 ) . Samples labeled by AF647 and CF680 were excited by an 647nm laser . The emission of both AF647 and CF680 was then split into two light paths as two channels using a dichroic mirror ( Chroma , cat # T685lpxr ) , and each channel was projected onto one - half of an EMCCD camera ( Andor iXon Ultra 897 ) . Color assignment of each localization was based on its intensity in the two channels . A cylindrical lens was inserted into the transmitted channel to acquire 3D localization ( 9 ) . 3D position of each localization was determined from the ellipticity of each point spread function .
