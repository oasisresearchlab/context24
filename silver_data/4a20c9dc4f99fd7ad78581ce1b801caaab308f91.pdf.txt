Because of the important role filopodia play in cell migration , fascin is emerging as a major target for cancer drug discovery . Critically lacking , however , is an understanding of the mechanism of bundle formation by fascin . Fascin consists of four ! - trefoil domains . Here , we show that fascin contains two major actin - binding sites , coinciding with regions of high sequence conservation in ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 . The site in ! - trefoil - 1 is located near the binding site of the fascin inhibitor macroketone and comprises residue Ser - 39 , whose phosphorylation by protein kinase C downregulates actin bundling and filopodia formation . The site in ! - trefoil - 3 is related by pseudo - twofold symmetry to that in ! - trefoil - 1 . The two sites are ~ 5 nm apart , resulting in a distance between actin filaments in the bundle of ~ 8 . 1 nm . Residue mutations in both sites disrupt bundle formation in vitro , as assessed by co - sedimentation with actin and electron microscopy , and severely impair filopodia formation in cells , as determined by rescue experiments in fascin - depleted cells . Mutations of other areas of the fascin surface also affect actin bundling and filopodia formation , albeit to a lesser extent , suggesting that in addition to the two major actin - binding sites , fascin makes secondary contacts with other filaments in the bundle . In a high - resolution crystal structure of fascin , molecules of glycerol and polyethylene glycol are bound in pockets located within the two major actin - binding sites . These molecules could guide the rational design of new anticancer fascin inhibitors . Fascin is the major actin filament ( F - actin ) bundling protein in protrusive cellular structures such as filopodia , dendrites and invadopodia that play critical roles in cell motility , guidance , and invasion of the extracellular matrix ( 1 - 3 ) . Fascin expression is upregulated in various types of cancers , including lymphomas , glioblastomas and carcinomas , where its overexpression correlates with increased tumor metastasis and invasiveness ( 4 ) . As a result , fascin is used as a marker in cancer diagnosis and prognosis , and is also emerging as an attractive target in cancer drug discovery ( 1 , 5 ) . The development of such therapeutic applications requires a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanism of F - actin bundling by fascin . An important step in this direction was the recent description of crystal structures of fascin , including that of a complex of fascin with the anti - metastatic agent macroketone ( 5 , 6 ) . The 55 - kDa fascin polypeptide folds into four ! - trefoil domains , with domains 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 forming two semi - independent units related by pseudo - twofold symmetry . The binding site of macroketone is located in ! - trefoil - 4 , near Ser - 39 in ! - trefoil - 1 , whose phosphorylation by protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibits actin bundling by fascin ( 7 ) . Ser - 39 is also part of a sequence motif ( 29 FGFKVNASASSLKKK 43 ) that shows similarity with an actin - binding site of another PKC substrate , myristoylated alanine - rich protein C - kinase substrate ( MARCKS ) ( 8 ) . Based on these observations , it is thought that the area surrounding Ser - 39 , near the interface between ! - trefoil domains 1 and 4 , harbors one of the actin - binding sites of fascin . Yet , this has not been conclusively demonstrated . Moreover , since its discovery fascin was shown to be monomeric ( 9 ) , implying that it must contain at least one more http : / / www . jbc . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1074 / jbc .

In accord with this notion , limited proteolysis indicated that a second actin - binding site could be contained within the fragment 277 - 493 , encompassing most of ! - trefoil domains 3 and 4 ( 7 ) . Mutagenesis screening in the Drosophila fascin homolog singed further identified two amino acids , Ser - 289 in ! - trefoil - 3 and Gly - 409 in ! - trefoil - 4 ( corresponding to Ser - 274 and Gly - 396 in human fascin ) , that when mutated produce severe kinked bristle phenotypes ( 10 ) . However , these two studies predate the determination of the crystal structure of fascin . In the structure , Ser - 274 and Gly - 396 are mostly buried , whereas the fragment 277 - 493 lacks one of the ! - strands of ! - trefoil - 3 , such that in both cases folding might have been compromised . Thus , our knowledge of the exact location and disposition of the actin - binding sites within the three - dimensional structure of fascin is unsatisfactory , and the mechanism of bundle formation is not well understood . Based on a high - resolution crystal structure of fascin , structure - guided mutagenesis , biochemical and cellular studies we show here that fascin contains two major actin - binding sites , coinciding with areas of high sequence conservation in ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Proteins – The cDNA encoding for human fascin - 1 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( clone MGC - 3899 ) and cloned between the Nde I and Eco RI sites of vector pTYB12 ( New England BioLabs ) . Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit ( Agilent ) . Cells were grown in Terrific Broth medium at 37°C to A 600 = 1 . 0 - 1 . 2 . Expression was induced with addition of 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - ! - D - thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 20°C . Cells were resuspended in chitin - column equilibration buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF ) and purified through a chitin affinity column , followed by purification on a Mono - Q ion exchange column ( GE Healthcare ) using a 40 - 500 mM NaCl gradient in 20 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] and 1 mM DTT . Selenomethionine - substituted fascin was obtained by growing cells in SelenoMet medium ( Athena Enzyme Systems ) , supplemented with 70 mg / ml selenomethionine ( Acros Organics ) . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described ( 11 ) . Crystallization , data collection and structure determination – Fascin was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM DTT and concentrated to 10 mg / ml using a Vivaspin centrifugal device ( Sartorius Stedim Biotech ) . Crystals of wild type and selenomethionine - substituted fascin were obtained by optimization of previously reported conditions ( PDB code : 1DFC ) using the hanging drop vapor - diffusion method at 20°C . A typical 2 µL drop consisted of a 1 : 1 ( v / v ) mixture of protein solution and a well solution containing 0 . 2 M lithium acetate dihydrate , 20 - 24 % PEG 3500 and 4 % glycerol . Crystals were flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen after a short passage through a solution containing 20 % glycerol added to the crystallization buffer . X - ray datasets were collected from wild type and Se - Met - substituted crystals ( Table 1 ) using beamline 17 - ID of the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association - Collaborative Access Team at the Advance Photon Source ( Argonne , IL ) . Data indexation and scaling were performed with the program HKL2000 ( HKL Research Inc . ) . The structure was determined using a combination of molecular replacement and single - wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing as implemented in the subroutine AutoSol of the program Phenix ( 12 ) . Model building and refinement were performed with the programs Coot ( 13 ) and Phenix . Illustrations were prepared with the program PyMOL ( DeLano Scientific LLC ) . Sedimentation ( pelleting ) assay – Actin ( 25 µM ) in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 ) was polymerized with addition of 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM ATP for 7 min at room temperature . Fascin constructs were first centrifuged at 224 , 000 x g for 30 min to remove potential aggregates . F - actin ( 15 µM ) was incubated with 15 µM fascin constructs overnight at room temperature . Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at two different speeds , 10 , 000 x g ( for bundling experiments ) and 224 , 000 x g ( for binding experiments ) . Equal volumes of supernatant and pellet were analyzed by 8 . 5 % SDS - PAGE . EM analysis of fascin - actin bundles – For EM visualization , actin at 25 µM was polymerized by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 5 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ! 3 ! as above . Bundles were prepared by mixing pre - polymerized actin with wild type or mutant fascin at a 1 : 1 molar ratio and incubating overnight . The samples were then diluted to 1 µM in F - buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT and 5 mM PIPES pH . 7 . 6 ) and applied to formvar and carbon - coated 200 mesh copper grids . The samples were adsorbed onto grids for 30 s , blotted to remove excess solution , negatively stained with 1 % ( wt / vol ) uranyl acetate for 1 min , blotted and dried . The EM study of actin filaments and fascin - actin bundles was performed on a JEM - 1011 transmission electron microscope ( JEOL ) at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and magnifications of 40 , 000X or 100 , 000X . Images were captured on an Orius 835 . 10W CCD camera ( Gatan ) . Bundle parameters , including width , inter - filament distance , and the number of filaments per bundle were measured using the Linescan tool of the MetaMorph imaging software ( Molecular Devices ) . The intensity profile along a line drawn across a bundle showed a series of peaks corresponding to the number of filaments in the bundle . The distance between peaks in the intensity profiles was taken as the distance between filament centers . Two - dimensional bundles in which all the actin filaments were in the same plane ( known as rafts ) were selected for determination of inter - filament distances , to circumvent typical problems encountered with the study of three - dimensional bundles such as disorder and polymorphism ( 14 ) . The two - dimensionality of the bundles was confirmed by analysis of tilted images at ±20° . For each fascin construct , ten or more bundles were analyzed . Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t - test with the program Excel ( Microsoft ) . Cell culture , transfection and microscopy – A fascin knockdown was generated as described ( 3 ) , by transfecting mouse melanoma B16 - F1 cultured cells ( 15 ) with shRNA construct pC - SUPER - fascin - Tm that targets nucleotides 741 – 759 of mouse fascin - 1 ( GenBank code : NM _ 007984 ) . CFP was expressed under a different promoter , to allow for the visualization of transfected cells . Transfection of one day old cultures ( day 1 ) of B16 - F1 cells at 60 – 80 % confluency was performed using Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS Reagents ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The following day ( day 2 ) , cells were replated and cultured overnight . On day 3 , cells were transfected with rescue constructs ( GFP vector or GFP - tagged human fascin constructs refractory to RNAi ) . On day 4 , cells were transferred onto laminin - coated glass coverslips and cultured for 3 days . On day 7 ( 6 days after the transfection with shRNA ) , cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min , permeabilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min , and stained with Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin for 30 min . Samples were analyzed using an inverted microscope ( Eclipse TE2000 , Nikon ) equipped with a Plan Apo 100X N . A . 1 . 3 objective ( Nikon ) and a Cascade 512B CCD camera ( Roper Scientific ) driven by the MetaMorph Imaging software ( Molecular Devices ) . For the quantification of filopodia , pC - SUPER - fascin - Tm positive cells were identified in the CFP channel , and GFP - fascin signals were imaged in the YFP channel . Filopodia were counted based on YFP fluorescence or filamentous actin staining . Only the bundles that showed 1 . 2 or higher fluorescence intensity above the local background were included . RESULTS Crystal structure of fascin . As a first step toward identifying the actin - binding sites on the surface of the fascin molecule , we turned to its crystal structure . A recently described crystal structure of fascin ( 6 ) had been deposited in the protein data bank approximately ten years ago ( PDB code : 1DFC ) . Based on this original work , two additional structures of fascin were recently reported ( 5 ) , alone and in complex with macroketone ( PDB codes : 3LLP and 3O8K ) . The reported structures , however , lacked numerous surface loops , limiting our ability to perform a careful analysis of the fascin surface to identify potential actin - binding sites . By optimizing the original crystallization conditions and combining molecular replacement phases with experimental phases from a Se - Met derivative ( see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1 ) , we obtained a 2 . 0 Å resolution structure of fascin that comprises all the surface loops ( Fig . 1 and supplemental Movie 1 ) . The asymmetric unit contains two fascin molecules . Molecule A is well defined in the electron density map , except for the by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 5 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ! 4 ! first seven N - terminal residues . Molecule B lacks five residues at the N - terminus and four residues of one of the loops ( 52 PDEA 55 ) . The surface of the fascin molecule is irregular , displaying many cavities and grooves , which in the current structure are occupied by solvent molecules and compounds used in crystallization and freezing , such as fragments of polyethylene glycol and molecules of glycerol ( Fig . 1 ) . As we explain below , the serendipitous occurrence of some these compounds within the actin - binding sites of the fascin molecule opens new opportunities for the rational design of fascin inhibitors . A large groove separates the four ! - trefoil domains into two pairs ( 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 ) disposed in V - shape with respect to one another ( supplemental Fig . 1 ) . A comparison of the two molecules of the asymmetric unit reveals that extensive interdomain interactions keep the relative position of ! - trefoil domains within pairs mostly unchanged ( C " RMSD of 0 . 56 Å and 0 . 47 Å between pairs 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 , respectively ) . In contrast , the orientation of the pairs with respect to each other varies more significantly , resulting in an overall C " RMSD of 1 . 2 Å between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit . Mapping the actin - binding sites by structure - guided mutagenesis . The architecture of the fascin molecule suggested that each pair of ! - trefoil domains could function semi - independently and could thus each harbor an actin - binding site . Because of the pseudo - twofold symmetry of the pairs , one possibility was that the actin - binding sites would be located at the interface between ! - trefoil domains . To test this possibility , we made triple mutants targeting well - separated , surface - exposed residues at the interface between ! - trefoil domains 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 , as well as 2 - 3 and 1 - 4 ( as a control ) . Because the surface of the actin filament is mostly negatively charged , we targeted for mutagenesis positively charged amino acids ( Lys and Arg ) on the surface of the fascin molecule , which were replaced by glutamate to interfere with potential electrostatic interactions ( see Figs . 1 A and 2 A for a detailed description of the mutants and their location in the structure ) . The mutants were named 1 - 2 , 2 - 3 , 3 - 4 and 1 - 4 , according to the numbers of the ! - trefoil domains that were mutated in each case . With the exception of mutant 3 - 4 , the circular dichroism spectra of the mutants aligned well with that of wild type fascin ( supplemental Fig . 2 ) , indicating that the mutated proteins were properly folded . The spectrum of mutant 3 - 4 was slightly shifted , possibly due to the breakage of a salt bridge linking ! - trefoil domains 3 and 4 between residues Lys - 464 ( mutated ) and Asp - 342 . Nevertheless , this mutant retained strong bundling activity in vitro ( see below ) , suggesting that it was properly folded . The actin binding and bundling activities of the fascin mutants were first assessed using high - speed ( 224 , 000 x g ) and low - speed ( 10 , 000 x g ) co - sedimentation with F - actin , respectively ( Fig . 2 A ) . All the mutants seemed to bind actin similarly to wild type fascin . In contrast , their bundling activities varied ; mutant 1 - 4 did not appear to bundle actin , mutant 1 - 2 showed somewhat reduced bundling activity , and mutants 2 - 3 and 3 - 4 showed actin bundling activities comparable to that of wild type fascin . This assay , however , could not reveal if these bundles were properly formed . Negative staining EM was used to investigate the morphology of the bundles ( Fig . 2 B ) . In the absence of fascin , the actin filaments did not form bundles , whereas filaments incubated overnight with wild type fascin formed parallel bundles . As determined by decoration with myosin subfragment 1 , the fascin - actin bundles had well defined polarity , i . e . all the filaments in a bundle had the same orientation ( supplemental Fig . 3 ) . The bundles formed by wild - type fascin had an average width of ~ 142 nm and contained ~ 17 filaments ( Fig . 2 C and Table 2 ) . For simplicity , the inter - filament distance was determined using bundles in which all the actin filaments were in the same plane ( rafts ) , as confirmed by analysis of tilted images at ±20° ( supplemental Fig . 4 ) , resulting in an apparent separation between filaments of ~ 8 . 1 nm ( Fig . 2 C and Table 2 ) . The bundles showed transverse periodicity of 36 . 9 nm , roughly corresponding to the crossover distance of the actin filament ( 35 . 7 nm ) ( 16 ) . Our observations are generally consistent with a previous study of wild - type fascin - actin bundles ( 17 ) , but contrary to these authors we found that the transverse pattern occurred at an angle of 63 . 0 ± 6 . 23° ( Fig . 2 B and Table 2 ) , and not perpendicular to the bundle axis as they had reported . In agreement with our results , another study of bundles reconstituted with mouse fascin also found 36 nm periodicity , with an angle of ~ 60° to the bundle axis ( 18 ) . It thus by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 5 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ! 5 ! appears that adjacent actin filaments in the fascin - actin bundle are either uniformly rotated or staggered by ~ 4 . 1 nm . EM analysis further revealed that all the fascin mutants had impaired bundling activity , albeit to different extents . Generally , the mutants produced bundles containing fewer and less densely packed filaments than wild type fascin ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Consistent with the low - speed co - sedimentation assay , mutant 1 - 4 showed the most dramatic defects , forming thin disordered bundles with fewer than five filaments per bundle . The remaining three mutants exhibited intermediate bundling defects , with ~ seven filaments per bundle . All the mutants , except mutant 2 - 3 , also displayed a statistically significant increase in the average distance between filaments in the bundle . Mutants 1 - 4 and 1 - 2 failed to produce the transverse periodicity observed in wild type fascin - actin bundles , an indication that significant changes had occurred in the architecture of their bundles . Mutant 3 - 4 , and to a lesser extent mutant 2 - 3 , showed less severe defects , forming bundles that displayed the characteristic transverse striation , albeit not as distinctly and regularly defined as in control bundles . Together , these data showed that despite their varying defects , none of the initial fascin mutants had entirely lost the ability to bundle F - actin , which suggested that the main actin - binding sites had not been totally disrupted . The two major actin - binding sites of fascin coincide with regions of high sequence conservation in ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 . We then attempted to identify the actin - binding sites by amino acid conservation analysis on the surface of the fascin molecule . Indeed , actin is highly conserved throughout evolution , which imposes significant constraints on the conservation of the actin - binding sites of proteins that interact with it . Through analysis of a large number of fascin sequences ( supplemental Fig . 5 ) , we determined and plotted the conservation scores of amino acids on the surface of the fascin structure using the program ConSurf ( 19 ) . This analysis identified two highly conserved regions related by pseudo - twofold symmetry and wrapping around ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 ( Fig . 3 A and supplemental Movie 1 ) . As above , mutations were introduced to perturb these sites ( Fig . 3 B ) . Mutant 1 ( so named because it targeted ! - trefoil - 1 ) combined four point mutations , adopted from mutants 1 - 2 and 1 - 4 that coincidentally displayed the weakest bundling activities among the mutants analyzed above . In high - and low - speed co - sedimentation assays with F - actin , mutant 1 and 3 ( a triple mutant targeting the conserved region in ! - trefoil - 3 ) bound actin , but only mutant 3 showed any bundling activity ( Fig . 3 B ) . More precise evidence was obtained by EM analysis , showing that mutants 1 and 3 recruited only a small fraction of the actin filaments into bundles ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . Moreover , the few bundles that were observed contained a small number of loosely packed and poorly aligned filaments . Individual actin filaments in both samples frequently showed laterally associated particles ( Fig . 3 C ) , most likely corresponding to fascin molecules . Combined , these results suggested that the mutations introduced in ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 disrupted one of two major actin - binding sites , whereas the other site was still functional , which would explain the inability of these mutants to form bundles while still binding to the sides of individual filaments . Based on the EM results , one might have expected to observe less bundling activity for mutant 3 in the low - speed co - sedimentation assay ( Fig . 3 B ) . Note , however , that even the loose bundles formed by mutants 1 and 1 - 4 ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , co - sedimented with F - actin when centrifuged for prolonged time ( supplemental Fig . 6 ) . This observation illustrates the susceptibility of the sedimentation assay to small changes in experimental conditions , and confirms that definitive conclusions about the bundling activity of the mutants can only be drawn after additional analysis by EM . Cellular phenotypes of the fascin mutants . To test the cellular effects of the fascin mutants , knockdown and rescue experiments were performed in mouse melanoma B16 - F1 cells ( Fig . 4 ) . As shown previously ( 13 ) , shRNA depletion of endogenous fascin dramatically decreases the number of filopodia in these cells . Using this system , we attempted to rescue filopodia formation by co - expressing GFP - tagged fascin mutants in cells co - expressing fascin shRNA . In control knockdown cells co - expressing a GFP vector , we observed very few filopodia that were typically buckled near the cell edge , which is consistent with previous observations ( 3 ) . by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 5 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ! 6 ! Moreover , these filopodia could only be detected by actin - staining with phalloidin , as they did not accumulate the GFP fluorescence marker . The co - expression of wild type GFP - fascin resulted in a ~ 3 - fold increase in the number of GFP - fascin - enriched filopodia compared to control cells . The co - expression with fascin mutants revealed that all the mutants were deficient in their ability to rescue filopodia formation and to localize to filopodial bundles , albeit to different extents . Thus , mutants 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 retained some activity , producing a slight increase in the number of filopodia and showing some enrichment in filopodia compared to control cells . Mutants 3 - 4 , 1 - 4 , 1 and 3 were unable to rescue filopodia formation . These four mutants also failed to localize to the few remaining filopodia detected by phalloidin staining , and instead appeared to be evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm . DISCUSSION Actin bundling proteins present at least two actin binding sites , which is commonly accomplished through dimerization , as is the case with the prototypical actin - bundling protein " - actinin ( 20 ) . However , some actin bundling proteins , such and fimbrin ( 21 ) , are monomeric but display internal pseudo - symmetry , and thus bind actin through two structurally related but different sites . As we have shown here , fascin belongs to the latter category . Collectively , our results suggest that fascin contains two major actin - binding sites located within ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 and related by pseudo - two - fold symmetry . Some evidence already implicated the site identified here in ! - trefoil - 1 in actin binding , including its proximity to the binding site of the fascin inhibitor macroketone ( 5 ) and the presence within this region of Ser - 39 that when phosphorylated by PKC inhibits F - actin bundling by fascin ( 7 ) . This area also includes residues 29 - 43 that had been postulated to participate in actin binding , based on limited sequence similarity with an actin - binding site in MARCKS ( 8 ) . The identification here of the actin - binding site in ! - trefoil - 1 was based on entirely different criteria , notably sequence conservation on the surface of a crystal structure of fascin in which all the loops could be visualized . This method also resulted in the identification of a novel actin - binding site in ! - trefoil domain 3 . Corroborating the results of the bioinformatics analysis , mutations of residues in both conserved surfaces ( mutants 1 and 3 ) impaired bundle formation in vitro and filopodia formation in cells . Mutant 1 - 4 , which also displayed severe F - actin bundling defects , partially overlaps with mutant 1 . Particularly , residues Lys - 22 and Lys - 43 , which were substituted in both mutants , fall near the regulatory residue Ser - 39 and form part of the MARCKS - related sequence ( Fig . 5 A ) , providing strong experimental support for the involvement of this sequence in actin - binding . Mutations outside the two major conserved regions generally had a milder phenotype in vitro and in cells . However , while the in vitro and cellular results were generally in good agreement , mutant 3 - 4 showed significant bundling activity in vitro but had no activity in cells . Certain discrepancy between the two sets of data was not totally unexpected , because some of the mutations may affect interactions with proteins other than actin in cells . For instance , fascin is known to interact with ! - catenin ( 22 ) , and was recently shown to also interact with Rab35 ( 23 ) . The latter interaction was proposed to play an important role in recruiting fascin to filopodia . However , the binding sites of ! - catenin and Rab35 on fascin are still unknown . It is thus likely that some of the mutations studied here , which cover almost the entire surface of the fascin molecule , affect the interactions of fascin with ! - catenin , Rab35 , as well as other binding partners of fascin in cells of which little is still known ( 1 ) . The bundling defects produced by mutations outside the two major actin - binding sites also suggest that fascin makes secondary contacts in the three - dimensional bundle , i . e . each fascin molecule might interact with more than two filaments in the bundle . This appears a likely possibility since the bundles are tightly packed , with an average apparent distance between filaments of ~ 8 . 1 nm , and the fascin molecule has a high degree of internal symmetry and similar dimensions ( ~ 5 - 6 nm ) in most directions . The observed distance between filaments in the bundle seems surprisingly small given the dimensions of the fascin molecule and those of the actin filament , whose thickness oscillates between ~ 6 and ~ 10 nm along the longitudinal axis ( 24 ) . Most likely , fascin binds at the interface between actin subunits by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 5 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ! 7 ! in the filament , a location where most actin - binding proteins bind ( 25 , 26 ) , bridging the narrow area of neighboring filaments . Another observation made here is that the transverse periodicity in wild type fascin - actin bundles occurs at an angle of ~ 63 . 0° , which is in agreement with a study of reconstituted bundles formed by mouse fascin ( 18 ) , but disagrees with another study that found that the repeat is perpendicular to the bundle axis ( 17 ) . Our results thus suggest that neighboring filaments in the bundle are either uniformly rotated or staggered by ~ 4 . 1 nm , which could help accommodate fascin molecules in the tight bundle . While the goal of our EM analysis was to compare bundles formed by wild type and mutant fascin under reported conditions ( 17 , 18 ) , it remains unclear how fascin constrains F - actin into such a tight bundle and what is the exact position and conformation of fascin in the bundle . These observations underscore the need for future high - resolution studies of the bundle using cryo - EM tomography . The conserved surface of ! - trefoil - 1 extends slightly into ! - trefoil - 4 and that of ! - trefoil - 3 extends into ! - trefoil - 2 ( Fig . 3 A ) , such that the actin - binding sites might straddle slightly into these adjacent domains . This probably explains why the binding of macroketone in ! - trefoil - 4 , at the edge of the conserved surface , interferes with filopodia formation . In this regard , the crystal structure determined here provides one additional important clue ; molecules of glycerol and polyethylene glycol are bound in pockets and clefts formed at the interface between domains within the two major actin - binding sites ( Fig . 5 ) . Particularly , the molecules of polyethylene glycol bound in the cleft formed at the interface between ! - trefoil domains 1 and 4 are positioned halfway in between the macroketone - binding site and Ser - 39 and the MARCKS - related sequence ( Fig . 5 A ) . These molecules seem to be tightly bound and their pockets appear better suited for small molecule recognition than that of macroketone , which looks loosely bound on the surface of the fascin molecule . These molecules of glycerol and polyethylene glycol could therefore guide the rational design of new fascin inhibitors to be used as anticancer agents . REFERENCES 1 . Machesky , L .

Structure of fascin and amino acids mutated in this study . Wall - eye stereo diagram of the 2 . 0 Å resolution crystal structure of fascin , showing ribbon and surface representations . There are two fascin molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal ; only molecule A is shown . The four ! - trefoil domains are highlighted with different colors , as indicated by the diagram at the bottom of the figure . Also shown are the side chains of residues mutated in this study ( cyan ) , molecules of glycerol and polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) bound in the structure , and Ser - 39 ( red ) , which is phosphorylated by PKC . Note that a large groove effectively separates the four ! - trefoil domains into two pairs , 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 . Inter - ! - trefoil domain contacts are more extensive within pairs ( see also supplementary Fig . 1 and supplementary Movie 1 ) . FIGURE 2 . Actin binding and bundling activities of wild type and mutant fascin . ( A ) Results of binding ( high - speed ; 224 , 000 x g ) and bundling ( low - speed ; 10 , 000 x g ) co - sedimentation ( pelleting ) assays with filamentous F - actin , including control experiments ( actin and fascin alone ) . Supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis . Also shown is a description of the mutants , including specific amino acids substituted in each mutant and schematic representations of their locations in the structure ( ! - trefoil domains colored according to figure 1 , mutated residues and Ser - 39 represented by blue balls and a red ball , respectively ) . Mutants are named according to the numbers of the ! - trefoil domains that were mutated in each case . ( B ) Representative transmission electron micrographs of negatively stained actin filaments alone and in the presence of wild type or mutant fascin ( aligned with part A ) . Low - magnification images ( left , scale bar 200 nm ) show that nearly all the actin filaments are incorporated into bundles in the presence of wild type fascin or fascin mutants . High - magnification images ( right , scale bar 50 nm ) show examples of a thick ordered bundle with periodic striations ( indicated by arrows ) formed by wild type fascin and thinner bundles with aberrant morphology formed by the fascin mutants . The bundles formed by mutants 2 - 3 and 3 - 4 often show striations ( indicated by arrows ) . ( C ) Quantitative analysis of the bundles formed in the presence of wild type and mutant fascin ( N = 10 ) . Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences relative to wild type fascin ( p < 0 . 02 ) . FIGURE 3 . Identification of two major actin - binding sites in ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 . ( A ) Two views of the surface of the fascin structure rotated by ~ 180° and colored by residue conservation ( conservation decreases from blue to red as indicated by the bottom bar ) . For reference , small domain - colored diagrams , in the same orientation , are shown alongside . The alignment of fascin sequences used to determine the conservation score of each residue is shown in supplemental Fig . 5 . Conservation scores were calculated and displayed with the programs ConSurf ( 19 ) and PyMOL ( DeLano Scientific LLC ) , respectively . Note that the two largest patches of conserved residues occur in ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 . The patch in ! - trefoil - 1 comprises residue Ser - 39 . The anti - metastatic drug macroketone ( 5 ) , also binds at the edge of this patch ( shown , although not part of this structure ) . In the current structure , molecules of polyethylene glycol and glycerol bind in pockets within the two conserved patches and could guide the design of anticancer drugs . Residues mutated in this study are labeled . ( B ) Actin binding and bundling assays with fascin mutants 1 and 3 targeting the conserved patches in ! - trefoil domains 1 and 3 ( conducted as in Fig . 2 A ) . ( C ) Transmission electron micrographs of negatively stained actin filaments alone and in the presence fascin mutants 1 and 3 ( conducted as in Fig . 2 B ) . These mutants have almost completely lost the ability to bundle actin , but can bind to the sides of individual actin filaments ( arrowheads ) . ( D ) Quantitative analysis of the bundles formed by mutants 1 and 3 ( conducted as in Fig . 2 C ) . by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 5 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ! 10 ! FIGURE 4 . Expression of GFP - fascin mutants in fascin - knockdown B16 - F1 cells . ( A ) B16 - F1 cells co - expressing fascin - shRNA and GFP - fascin constructs ( green ) . Cells are co - stained with phalloidin ( red ) to visualize F - actin . The expressed GFP - fascin constructs are indicated at the top of each column ( mutants are named according to Figs . 2 and 3 ) . Boxed regions are enlarged at the bottom ( scale bar , 5 µm ) . ( B ) Quantitative analysis of the number of filopodia per cell based on phalloidin staining ( red ) or the GFP signal ( green ) for each GFP - fusion construct . Data are shown as box - and - whisker plots : box length represents values from low to upper quartile , whiskers encompass 5th to 95th percentile , boxes are divided by the median and a bar represents the mean value ( N = 27 to 36 per construct ) . FIGURE 5 . Molecules of Glycerol and PEG bound in pockets within the two major actin - binding sites of fascin . ( A ) Surface representation of the actin - binding site in ! - trefoil - 1 colored by residue conservation ( left ) and a enlarged view ( right ) showing molecules of polyethylene - glycol ( PEG ) bound in the cleft formed at the interface between ! - trefoil domains 1 and 4 ( see also supplemental Movie 1 ) . Residue conservation decreases from blue to red as indicated by the bar at the bottom of the figure . Note that the actin - binding site in ! - trefoil - 1 includes the MARCKS - related sequence ( fascin residues 29 - 43 , indicated by a mesh surface ) and residue Ser - 39 ( labeled ) , which have been implicated in actin binding ( 7 , 8 ) . An alignment of the sequences of human fascin ( UniProt Q16658 ) and MARCKS ( UniProt P29966 ) is shown for this region ( identity – dark blue ; conservation – different shades of cyan ) . ( B ) Surface representation of the actin - binding site in ! - trefoil - 3 ( left ) and an enlarged view ( right ) of a molecule of glycerol bound in a pocket formed at the interface between ! - trefoil domains 2 , 3 and 4 . The two actin - binding sites are related by pseudo - twofold symmetry as indicated . Also shown are some of the amino acids that form the binding pockets for the molecules of PEG and glycerol as well as the 2Fo - Fc electron density map contoured at 1 . 0 # around these molecules . Shown alongside are small domain - colored diagrams of the fascin structure in the same orientation . by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 5 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ! 11 !
