It represents the most frequent primitive malignant tumour of the skeletal system and is characterized by an extremely aggressive clinical course , with rapid development of lung metastases . In the last few years , targeting Src in the treatment of OS has become one of the major challenges in the development of new drugs , since an elevated Src kinase activity has been associated with the development and the maintenance of the OS malignant phenotype . Recently , SI - 83 , a novel pyrazolo [ 3 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine derivate Src inhibitor , was selected as a promising OS therapeutic drug because of its elevated anti - tumour eﬀects toward human OS . In the present study , gel - based proteomics and phosphoproteomics revealed significant changes in proteins involved in many cancer related processes . We got insight into SI - 83 proapoptotic and antiproliferative properties ( overrepresentation of GRIA1 , GRP78 , and CALR and underrepresentation of NPM1 , RCN , and P4HB ) . Nevertheless , the most significant findings of our work are the SI - 83 induced dephosphorylation of ARPC5L , a subunit of the actin related Arp2 / 3 complex , and the decrease of other cytoskeleton proteins . These data , together with a dramatic impairment of SaOS - 2 cell migration and adhesion , suggest that SI - 83 may have antimetastatic features that enhance its use as a potent OS chemotherapeutic drug . Introduction Osteosarcoma ( OS ) is a primary highly malignant tumour of bone , aﬀecting mainly children and young adults with an annual incidence rate of 5 . 6 per million , and accounts for 60 % of paediatric bone tumours . It is characterized by an extremely aggressive clinical course , with rapid development of metastases to the lungs and distant bones . 1 Although the prognosis of OS has been notably improved ( 5 - year survival rates of up to 50 – 70 % ) by multimodal therapy , a considerable number of patients develop pulmonary metastasis , decreasing their overall 5 year survival rate to only 28 % . 1 Hence , there is a real need to develop novel targeted therapeutic approaches aimed at treating OS . During the past decade , Src has attracted interest as a thera - peutic target . Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the c - Src proto - oncogene and it is involved in myriad funda - mental cellular processes , such as cell proliferation , migration , invasion and survival . Although activating Src mutations are rarely associated with human cancer , both overexpression and overactivation of Src have been shown to contribute to trans - formation and malignant cancer progression . 2 Recently , numerous Src inhibitors have been identified based on diﬀerent mechanisms of inhibition . 2 Among them a novel pyrazolo [ 3 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine derivative , namely SI - 83 , was selected by us because of its high antiproliferative and proapoptotic a Dipartimento di Biotecnologie , Chimica e Farmacia , Universita ` degli Studi di Siena , via Fiorentina 1 , 53100 Siena , Italy .

To get insight into the complex molecular mechanism of SI - 83 in OS cells , we conducted a comparative proteomic and phospho - proteomic investigation combined with mass spectrometry tech - nology . To our knowledge , this is the first 2 - DE based analysis of human OS cells treated with SI - 83 or any other Src inhibitor . Overall , our results revealed Src inhibition by SI - 83 induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in SaOS - 2 cells through the deregulation of glutamate receptor 1 ( GRIA1 ) , two proteasome subunits ( PSMA 5 and PSMA6 ) , and several ER resident proteins such as GRP78 , CARL , P4HB , NPM1 , and RCN . In addition , we demonstrated the antimetastatic activity of our compound in which the dephosphorylation of ARPC5L represents the key event leading to disruption of cytoskeletal architecture and impairment of cellular migration . Materials and methods Ethics statement The whole study was conducted following the approval of the University of Florence Hospital Ethics Committee , namely ‘‘Comitato Etico Locale dell’Azienda Ospedaliera - Universitaria Careggi’’ . The investigation conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki . Bone biopsies were obtained from patients who underwent orthopedic surgery after a written informed consent . Cell cultures and reagents The human OS cell line SaOS - 2 was obtained from ATCC ( HTB - 85 ; Manassas ) ; primary human osteoblasts ( HOB ) were obtained as reported in ref . 4 and 5 and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 U ml (cid:2) 1 penicillin , and 100 m g ml (cid:2) 1 streptomycin at 37 1 C , in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air . DMSO treated cells were used as a negative control . Unless otherwise indicated , all high quality reagents were from Sigma - Aldrich ( Milan , Italy ) . All water used was Milli - Q ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , USA ) . Two - dimensional electrophoresis ( 2 - DE ) and mass spectrometry Confluent SaOS - 2 cells were treated with 25 m M SI - 83 for 3 hours , and then resuspended in lysis buﬀer ( 9 M urea , 65 mM CHAPS , 65 mM DTE , 40 mM Tris , 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 50 mM NaF ) , sonicated for 10 minutes at 4 1 C and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 12 000 (cid:3) g at 4 1 C . One mg of protein samples were subjected to 2 - DE as previously reported . 6 Protein samples were applied to an Immobiline strip ( 18 cm , IPG strips , GE Healthcare ) consisting of a nonlinear gradient , pH range 3 – 10 , previously rehydrated . IEF was carried out on Multiphor II ( GE Healthcare ) . After the first dimension , the strips were equilibrated for 15 min in a buffer containing 6 M urea , 20 % glycerol , 2 % SDS , 2 % DTE and then for 15 min in the same buffer containing 2 . 5 % iodoacet - amide instead of DTE . After equilibration , strips were loaded on 9 – 16 % gradient SDS polyacrylamide gels for second - dimension separation . Gels were run at 40 mA per gel . For total protein detection , CBB G - 250 staining was performed and images of gels were acquired ( ImageScanner , GE Healthcare ) . Alternatively , for specific phosphoprotein staining , ProQ Diamond dye ( Invitrogen Molecular Probes , Eugene , USA ) was used according to the manu - facturer’s instructions . 5 Images were acquired using a Typhoon scanner ( ex : 532 nm , em : 555 nm ; Amersham Bioscience ) . Images were analyzed using ImageMaster t Platinum ( GE Healthcare ) . For comparative proteomic analysis , spot % relative abundance was used ( threshold set at 2 . 0 - fold change ) . Protein spots of interest were identified by MALDI - ToF / MS or by gel matching with proteomic reference maps , already produced , calibrated and characterized in our laboratories . 5 , 6 Protein spots from 2 - DE were excised from the gel , triturated , alkylated and digested with trypsin . Digested peptides were analyzed using a Voyager - DE PRO spectrometer ( Applera ) , using CHCA as a matrix . Peptide mass spectra for PMF experiments were acquired in reflectron mode ; internal mass calibration was performed with peptides derived from trypsin autoproteolysis . PSD fragment ion spectra were eventually acquired after isolation of the appropriate precursor . Data were elaborated using the DataExplorer 5 . 1 . Mascot software v . 2 . 2 ( Matrix Science ) was used to identify spots from the NCBI non - redundant database . Candidates with a score 4 81 ( corresponding to p o 0 . 05 for a significant identification ) were further evaluated by comparison with experimental coordinates from 2 - DE . Measurements of intracellular Ca 2 + release in SaOS - 2 cells 5 (cid:3) 10 5 cells were treated with or without 12 . 5 m M SI - 83 for 1 , 2 or 3 hours to detect the changes in intracellular Ca 2 + . The cells from each treatment were individually harvested , washed with PBS twice and resuspended in PBS containing Fluo - 4 / AM ( 2 . 5 m M ) and probenecid ( 2 mM ) . After incubation for 30 min at 37 1 C in the dark , cells were resuspended with PBS and the fluorescence intensities were measured by FACSCalibur 4CA flow cytometry ( Becton - Dickson ) at Ex / Em 488 / 525 nm . Results were quantified using BD CellQuest Pro software . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) Cell samples were fixed in a cold Karnovsky fixative and maintained at 4 1 C for 2 hours . Fixed cells were washed in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buﬀer ( pH 7 . 2 ) for 12 hours , postfixed in 1 % buﬀered osmium tetroxide for 1 hour at 4 1 C , dehydrated and embedded in Epon Araldite .

BioPlex phosphoprotein assay The relative phosphorylation level of Akt and ERK 1 / 2 was deter - mined using the Bioplex t phosphoprotein detection kit ( Bioplex , BioRad , Hercules , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Serum starved SaOs - 2 cells were pretreated with SI - 83 25 m M for 30 minutes ( T 0 ) , then the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10 % FCS and treated with 25 m M SI - 83 for 15 minutes , 30 minutes , 1 hour , 2 hours and 3 hours . Data are reported as mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) ; relative MFI was calculated by normal - izing values of phosphoproteins to total protein levels . Fluorescence microscopy SaOS - 2 and HOB cells were treated for 24 hours with 25 m M SI - 83 . After treatment , immunofluorescence staining for actin , tubulin or vimentin ( Molecular Probes ) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Slides were observed under a LeitzAristoplan light microscope equipped with a fluorescence apparatus . Migration and adhesion assays Migration was measured by wound healing assay . Cells at 80 % confluence were streaked with a sterile pipette tip , and allowed to recover in 25 m M SI - 83 treated media . After 24 hours , plates were visualized at 10 (cid:3) magnification and migration was deter - mined as the area that had been reinvaded with SaOS - 2 at 24 hours after wounding . The wound area was quantified using NIH Image J software . For adhesion assay , a 96 well plate was coated with collagen type I at 4 1 C overnight and nonspecific sites were blocked with heat denatured BSA . SaOS - 2 cells were seeded at 5 (cid:3) 10 4 cells per well in the presence of 25 m M SI - 83 and allowed to adhere for 20 minutes . Nonadherent cells were removed by rinsing with PBS , fixed with 5 % glutaraldehyde and washed with water . Attached cells were stained with a 0 . 1 ( w / v ) crystal violet solution for 1 hour . The dye was solubilized with 10 % acetic acid , and the stain intensity was quantified by spectrophotometry ( 570 nm ) . Statistical analysis All experiments were carried out in triplicate ; data are presented as average values with standard error . Unpaired Student’s t - test and multiple measures ANOVA analysis followed by the Bonferroni - type multiple comparison were used when necessary . Diﬀerences with at least a p - value r 0 . 05 were considered significant . For comparative proteomic analysis , only representative gels are shown . Results Comparative proteomics and phosphoproteomics Comparative proteomic analysis allowed us to highlight the eﬀects of SI - 83 treatment on OS cells ( Fig . S1 , ESI † ) . For proteomic experiments , we used SaOS - 2 cells not subjected to serum starvation prior to treatments . Similarly to our previous studies , 3 , 4 we adopted this strategy in order to avoid the complex and unpredictable eﬀects that incubation in serum free medium might possibly have on cells . 7 , 8 In our proteomic maps , we globally detected 31 protein spots diﬀerently represented , corresponding to 25 diﬀerent gene products . Identified proteins were clustered into functional groups ( Table S1 , ESI † ) . Energy metabolism . One of the two a - enolase molecular species was more abundant ( spot ENO1 , 3 . 8 - fold ) while the other was ( spot ENO1 _ b ) completely absent after treatment with SI - 83 . Triosophosphate isomerase was also overrepresented ( spot TPI1 , 3 . 28 fold ) in the SI - 83 treated sample . Actually , we expected a reduced energetic metabolism after treatment with a cell viability inhibitor . Spot ENO1 _ b experimental coordinates ( p I 5 . 84 / M r 39 334 ) suggested an alternative splicing of ENO1 , whose tran - script encodes two structurally and functionally distinct proteins , a 48 kDa ENO1 enzyme and the 37 kDa MYC promoter binding protein ( MBP - 1 ) . MBP 1 is a negative regulator of c - myc gene expression and its tumour suppressor role was proposed . 9 Never - theless , the decrease of MBP - 1 protein in SI - 83 treated SaOS - 2 cells was in agreement with what was already demonstrated in several cancer cells as a consequence of their arrest in the G0 – G1 phase of the cell cycle by antiproliferative agents . 9 , 10 Redox regulation . Three protein spots ( SOD1 , TXNDC17 and SH3BGRL ) corresponding to Cu – Zn superoxide dismutase , thioredoxin domain containing protein 17 and SH3 domain binding glutamic acid - rich - like protein , respectively , have not been found in SI - 83 treated SaOS - 2 cells . SOD1 represents the primary enzymatic defence against ROS and is involved in gene expression regulation , in cytoskeleton organization and in mitochondria homeostasis . 11 Low levels of SOD1 , caused for example by chemotherapy , 12 , 13 impairs mitochondrial activity promoting apoptosis . 11 TXNDC17 has disulphide - reductase activity and is a NF - k B signalling pathway modulator . In RNA interference experiments , the depletion of TXNDC17 promotes TNF - a induced apoptosis . 14 Nucleotide metabolism . Following SI - 83 treatment , a general decrease in proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism , like spots APRT and NDPKA , was observed and this finding directly correlates with the inhibition of cellular proliferation . More - over , high levels of NDPKA were detected in advanced stage thyroid carcinoma and associated with a significant reduction in survival for neuroblastoma and OS patients . 15 Only bifunctional purine biosynthesis protein PURH ( spot ATIC ) was found to be overrepresented ( 2 . 37 fold ) . In addition , this protein spot shifted towards a more basic p I value ( from 6 . 40 to 6 . 42 pH units ) suggesting a dephosphorylation event , the latter was confirmed by our phosphoproteomic approach ( Fig . 1 , panels A – D ) . ATIC , whose phosphorylation is a key event in enhancing its enzymatic activity , catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and thus it is an interesting target for chemotherapeutic intervention . 16 Protein fate . We observed low levels of protein disulfide - isomerase ( spots P4HB and P4HB _ a ) , nucleophosmin ( spots NPM1 , NPM1 _ a and NPM1 _ b ) , reticulocalbin - 1 ( spot RCN1 and RCN1 _ a ) Molecular BioSystems Paper P ub li s h e d on 10 F e b r u a r y 2014 .

P4HB represents the main source of cellular protein disulphide isomerase ( PDI ) activity . PDI activity inhibition enhances apoptotic response to ER stress inducing agents in melanoma cells . 17 NPM1 is a nucleolar phosphor protein related to a variety of signalling pathways regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis . Its expression is downregulated in OS MG - 63 and leukemia HL - 60 cells after treatment with proapoptotic agents . 18 RCN1 is a calcium - binding high aﬃnity protein . Although the detailed physiological functions of RCN1 have not been fully elucidated yet , it may have a role in protein synthesis , modifica - tion and transport , due to its localization in the ER lumen of several cell lines . 19 RCN1 is overexpressed in hepatoma cancer 19 and in breast cancer cell lines , 20 showing a highly invasive phenotype thus suggesting a potential role in tumour progression and metastatic power . RCN1 underexpression was observed in hepatoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma following the treatment with proapoptotic agents . 19 HSPA8 is a molecular chaperone belonging to the HSP70 family and possesses well known anti - apoptotic properties . 21 CAPNS1 is the regulatory subunit of the calpains system , a family of Ca 2 + regulated cysteine proteases that are important regulators of intracellular activities such as apoptosis , protein kinase abundance , and cell - cycle progres - sion . Calpains are important players in cell death signalling with both pro - or antiapoptotic functions . 22 However , calpain activation has been established in glioblastoma cell lines after the treatment with anticancer drugs . 23 CALR is an abundant ER Ca 2 + - binding chaperone with important functions in Ca 2 + homeostasis and signalling , as well as in protein and glycoprotein folding . 24 Its overexpression is an indicator of ER stress mediated apoptosis in drug treated cancer cells . 24 – 26 GPR78 is an ER mole - cular chaperone and a key regulator of the ER stress transducer . 25 GRP78 is upregulated in cancer cell lines as a hallmark of ER stress and a biomarker of drug induced apoptosis . 24 – 27 Protein degradation . Spots PSMA5 and PSMA6 , corresponding to the proteasome subunits alpha type - 5 and - 6 , respectively , were not present in SI - 83 treated SaOS - 2 cells , suggesting the overall inhibition of the proteasome system , a multi - catalytic proteinase complex responsible for intracellular protein degradation and regulating a number of cellular processes including apoptosis . 28 Signal transduction . A significant increase of glutamate receptor 1 ( spot GRIA1 , 3 . 98 - fold ) was observed after SI - 83 treatment in SaOS - 2 cells , whose overstimulation may be responsible for an excessive Ca 2 + influx into the cell . In the same functional class , transcriptionally controlled tumour protein 1 ( TCTP ) was found to be absent following SI - 83 treatment . TCTP is an antiapoptotic factor protecting cells from Ca 2 + stress induced apoptosis . The increased TCPC expression level was found in many human cancers while its reduction makes cancer cells more sensitive to cell death by oxidative and metabolic stress . 29 Cytoskeleton and microtubules . Two actin - binding proteins , namely coatosin - like protein ( spot COTL1 , 0 . 13 fold ) and tropomyosin a - 4 - chain ( spot TPM4 , 0 . 28 - fold ) have been found to be underrepresented after SI - 83 treatment . COTL1 is a human filamentous actin - binding protein , whose role in actin polymerization or cytoskeleton organization is not well defined . 30 COTL1 interacts and stabilizes the chaperone for 5 - lipoxygenase . 30 COTL1 is upregulated in SCLC , urinary bladder cancer cells and in the serum of pancreatic cancer patients . 30 TPM4 belongs to the low molecular weight ( LMW ) class of tropomyosins , a ubiquitous family of highly conserved proteins . They bind along the length of actin filaments and stabilize their structures by regulating access of the filament to other actin regulatory proteins such as gelsolin , Arp2 / 3 , and ADF / cofilin . 31 LMW tropomyosins are associated with processes where higher cytoskeletal plasticity is involved , as they are present in high amounts in the highly motile ruﬄe regions of fibroblasts , as well as in transformed and cancerous cells . 32 To verify changes in the global phosphoproteome of OS cells after SI - 83 treatment , we carried out 2 - DE analysis coupled to ProQ staining . Three phosphorylated molecular species were observed in DMSO treated SaOS - 2 cells whose signals were completely missing in the SI - 83 treated sample ( Fig . 1 ) : ATIC , spot HSPB7 corresponding to the heat shock protein beta - 7 and spot ARPC5L corresponding to actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex subunit 5 ( p16 - Arc ) - like protein . HSPB7 is a member of the small heat shock protein ( sHSP ) family , which is able to interact with components of the actin structures to protect the cytoskeleton against stress mediated injuries and thus to maintain the cellular functionality . 33 Although phosphoryla - tion was demonstrated to regulate and mediate functionality of sHSP family members , this kind of modification in HSPB7 is still under investigation . 33 ARPC5L was identified as the isoform B of ARPC5 within the Arp2 / 3 complex , 34 a multiprotein complex that mediates the Fig . 1 Expanded views of two - dimensional gel regions . Zooms from the two - dimensional gels show the diﬀerent expression ( A and B ) and phosphorylation ( C and D ) patterns of PurH in DMSO - and SI - 83 - treated SaOS - 2 cells . Zooms from the two - dimensional gels show the diﬀerent phosphorylation patterns of the ARP2 / 3 complex subunit 5 - like protein spot ( ARPC5L ) and heat shock protein beta - 7 ( spot HSPB7 ) in DMSO - ( E ) and SI - 83 - treated ( F ) SaOS - 2 cells .

Eﬀects of SI - 83 on intracellular Ca 2 + release in SaOS - 2 cells To confirm that the SI - 83 - induced apoptosis could be related to contributions from the ER stress pathways , SaOS - 2 cells were treated with 12 . 5 m M SI - 83 for the indicated period of time , the release of Ca 2 + was examined , the quantities and results are shown in Fig . 2 . The flow cytometry assay indicated that SI - 83 administration resulted in a right shift of the Fluo - 4 fluorescence indicating the release of Ca 2 + . In detail , SI - 83 treatment induced an increment of about 25 % over a period of three hours . SI - 83 negatively aﬀects SaOS - 2 cells morphology , cytoskeleton organization and migration In comparison to untreated SaOS - 2 cells , incubation with 25 m M SI - 83 for 3 hours led to dramatic alterations of normal cellular architecture , showing ultrastructural changes typical of apoptosis ( Fig . S2A , ESI † ) : evident condensation and marginalization of chromatin , diﬀused vacuolization of cytoplasm and break - down of the cell membrane . In contrast , SI - 83 treatment induced only minor changes in the ultrastructures of HOB ( Fig . S2B , ESI † ) . In addition , we examined the phosphorylation state of AKT and ERK1 / 2 , downstream eﬀectors of Src in pathways for cellular survival and proliferation ( Fig . S3 , ESI † ) . These results confirmed what was observed in dasatinib treated SaOS - 2 cells , 35 where Src inhibition aﬀects cell growth and proliferation through downstream AKT and ERK1 / 2 independent signalling . Alternatively , as suggested by the rapid reactivation of ERK1 / 2 to basal levels , a compensatory pathway may be activated by cells in response to Src inhibition . 36 Upon SI - 83 treatment , SaOS - 2 cells displayed a very diﬀerent morphology , becoming more rounded and having smaller dimensions : actin and tubulin structures were not organized and were poorly present , cell – cell contact points were very few and extensive granulation was visible all around nuclei ( Fig . 3A , B and E , F ) . In contrast , only minor effects were visible in SI - 83 - treated HOB ( Fig . 3C , D and G , H ) . This behaviour was consistent with the specificity of action of SI - 83 towards cancer cells that we previously observed concerning the inhibition of cell viability , the arrest of the mitotic cycle and the induction of apoptosis . 4 Despite some important differences existing between SaOS - 2 and HOB cells concerning vinculin structure , treatment with SI - 83 did not induce appreciable changes in vinculin organiza - tion ( Fig . 3J – L ) . Based on the observed morphological changes in SaOS - 2 cells following SI - 83 treatment , we investigated the eﬀect of Src inhibition on cell migration and invasion . Our compound significantly inhibited both SaOS - 2 cell migration ( 45 % p o 0 . 05 , Fig . 4A ) and adhesion ( 44 % p o 0 . 05 , Fig . 4B ) . Discussion SI - 83 is a new pyrazolo [ 3 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine derivative Src inhibitor , with novel potential therapeutic eﬀects on bone sarcomas . 3 , 4 We demonstrated that SI - 83 decreased the percentage of viable cells Fig . 2 Eﬀects of SI - 83 on the intracellular Ca 2 + release in SaOS - 2 cells .

To our knowledge , this is the first 2 - DE based analysis of human OS cells treated with SI - 83 or any other Src inhibitors . Overall , twenty - six diﬀerentially represented or diﬀerentially phosphorylated proteins were identified and functionally clas - sified into categories associated with typical cancer processes such as cell proliferation , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis , cell migration and invasion . Our proteomic and phosphoproteomic data integrated with the biological data provided in this study and the biological data on apoptosis and proliferation that we previously reported , 3 , 4 and allowed us to suggest a hypothetical mechanism of action of SI - 83 as described in Fig . 5 . Decrease of NDPKA and APRT together with dephosphoryla - tion of ATIC strongly indicated that purine synthesis was highly impaired after SI - 83 treatment . These data suggest that SI - 83 may exert its antiproliferative activity through inhibition of both de novo and salvage nucleotide synthesis using a mecha - nism independent of PI3K / Akt cassette regulation . 16 , 37 More - over , ATIC dephosphorylation , and its consequent decreased enzymatic activity , could make methotrexate therapeutic inter - vention much more eﬀective . 16 SI - 83 treatment of SaOS - 2 cells caused the increase of GRIA1 protein , whose overstimulation may be responsible for the observed excessive Ca 2 + influx into the cell that significantly disrupts cellular ion homeostasis overdrawing ER mediated stress and apoptosis . 38 – 40 This mechanism of action of SI - 83 induced apoptosis in cancer cells is also reinforced by the observed low levels of two proteasome subunits ( PSMA5 and PSMA6 proteins ) , and the altered levels of some ER resident proteins such as NPM1 , CAPNS1 , CALR , GRP78 and RCN1 . A decreased proteasomal activity was demonstrated during Src inhibitor induced apoptosis in SaOS - 2 cells 41 and was found to be responsible for the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER , which in turn promoted ER stress mediated cell death and apoptosis . 42 Moreover , the change in expression levels of ER resident proteins is considered a hallmark of ER stress , 19 , 23 , 27 and the deregulation of such proteins in tumour cells has been frequently associated with treatment with anticancer drugs as well as proapoptotic agents . 18 , 19 , 23 – 27 , 43 Our findings are in agreement with our previous report on proapoptotic and noncytotoxic activity of SI - 83 . 4 Moreover , the morphological analysis reported here confirmed the pro - apoptotic behaviour of our compound with little or no eﬀect on normal HOB . Proteomics and phosphoproteomics also revealed signifi - cant quantitative changes in proteins involved in cytoskeleton Fig . 4 Migration and adhesion assays of SI - 83 - treated SaOS - 2 cells . ( A ) Migration assay . Wound closure by SaOS - 2 at 24 hours ( reinvaded area ) was measured as an index of migration .

BioSyst . , 2014 , 10 , 1305 - - 1312 | 1311 organization and regulation of actin polymerization , such as decreased levels of COTL1 and TPM4 proteins , and dephos - phorylation of HSPB7 and ARPC5L proteins . The most significant change was represented by SI - 83 induced ARPC5L dephosphoryla - tion . ARPC5L was identified as the isoform B of the ARPC5 subunit within the Arp2 / 3 complex . 34 , 44 This complex is a key cell machinery mandatory for the formation of branched actin networks at the leading edge of motile and invasive tumour cells . 34 , 44 , 45 Despite the high grade homology and the same cellular localization , the two ARPC5 isoforms show clear diﬀerences in their tissue expression patterns , in their solvent exposed surfaces as well as in their phosphorylation patterns . 34 , 44 Such diﬀerences strongly suggest a functional distinction between the two isoforms and a more specialized , although still undetermined , role for ARPC5L . It is well known that Src indirectly regulates Arp2 / 3 complex activity through cortactin within processes crucial in cancer progression such as tumour cell migration or invadopodia mediated extracellular matrix degradation . 45 , 46 In particular , Src phosphorylated cortactin plays a role in stabilizing the binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex to F - actin and thus enhances Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerization . 47 Our results suggest that Src kinase may additionally regulate Arp2 / 3 complex activity by altering the phosphorylation state of ARPC5L , although through so far undetermined downstream eﬀectors . Other studies demon - strated that a decrease in actin turnover and an impaired Arp2 / 3 complex function may promote apoptosis . 48 Observed alterations of proteins playing roles in cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal regulation were accompanied by severe morphological , ultrastructural and functional changes in SI - 83 treated SaOS - 2 cells showing disruption of cytoskeletal architecture and consequent dramatic impairment of migration and adhesion , while normal HOB were poorly aﬀected by SI - 83 treatment . In agreement with previous reports on dasatinib , 49 – 51 taken together these results indicate that , in addition to its already characterized proapoptotic properties , SI - 83 may have antimetastatic features mediated by impaired actin polymeriza - tion and cytoskeletal control , thus enhancing its potential use as a potent anti - osteosarcoma chemotherapeutic drug with less side effects on non - neoplastic counterpart cells .
