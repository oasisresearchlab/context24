We identified four polypeptides of 47 , 44 , 40 , and 35 kD that bind to profilin - Sepharose and elute with high salt . When purified by conventional chromatography using an antibody to the 47 - kD poly - peptide , these four polypeptides copurified as a stoichiometric complex together with three additional polypeptides of 19 , 18 , and 13 kD that varied in their proportions to the other polypeptides . Partial protein sequences showed that the 47 - kD polypeptide is a homologue of S . pombe act2 and the 44 - kD polypep - tide is a homologue of S . cerevisiae ACT2 , both un - conventional actins . The 40 - kD polypeptide contains a sequence similar to the WIM0 motif of the Ga subunit of a trimeric G - protein from Dictyostelium dis - coideum . From partial sequences , the 35 - , 19 - , and 18 - kD polypeptides appear to be novel proteins . On gel filtration the complex of purified polypeptides cochromatograph with a Stokes ' radius of 4 . 8 nm , a value consistent with a globular particle of 220 kD containing one copy of each polypeptide . Cell extracts also contain components of the complex that do not bind the profilin column . Affinity purified antibodies localize 47 - and 18 / 19 - kD polypeptides in the cortex and filopodia of Acanthamoeba . Antibodies to the 47 - kD unconventional actin cross - react on immunoblots with polypeptides of similar size in Dictyostelium , rabbit muscle , and conventional preparations of rabbit muscle actin but do not react with actin . p ROFILIN was onginaUy characterized as an actin monomer sequestering protein that forms a 1 : 1 com - plex with actin monomers in vitro and inhibits sponta - neous nucleation of actin filaments ( Carlsson et al . , 1977 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ; Lal and Korn , 1985 ) . Profilin in - hibits elongation more effectively at the pointed end of actin filaments than at the barbed end , since the actin profilin com - plex can bind to the barbed end but not the pointed end ( Pol - lard and Cooper , 1984 ) . Profilin also catalyzes actin nucleo - tide exchange by binding to actin monomers and lowering the affinity of actin for bound nucleotide ( Mockrin and Korn , 1980 ; Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991b ) . This activity may contribute to recycling ADP - actin released from de - polymerizing filaments to ATP - actin ready for repolymer - ization during the turnover of filaments in the cell ( Gold - schmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991b ) . Recent evidence suggests that profilin may even aid in the transfer of actin from the se - Dr . L . M .

Profilin also binds to membrane phospholipids phosphati - dylinositol 4 monophosphate ( PIP ) ~ and phosphatidylinosi - tol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) and inhibits hydrolysis of these lipids by phospholipase C - ~ ( PLC - y ) ( Goldschmidt - Cler - mont et al . , 1990 ; Machesky et al . , 1990 ) . Phosphorylation of PLC - y by the activated EGF receptor overcomes the pro - filin inhibition ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991a ) . This provides a plausible biochemical mechanism for regulation of PLC - ~ by EGF and a possible way to release profilin from the membrane to interact with actin . Profilin does not bind to actin and phosphoinositides simultaneously ( Lassing and Lindberg , 1985 ) . Poly - L - proline is another ligand of profilin ( Tanaka and Shibata , 1985 ) . This interaction has no known physiologi - cal function , but poly - L - proline Sepharose affinity columns have been very useful for purifying profilin ( Kaiser et al . , 1989 ; Janmey , 1991 ) . It is conceivable that profilin binds to polyproline sequences that are present in many cytoplasmic 1 .

In a search for new profilin ligands , we discovered seven proteins that bind to profilin - aflinity columns . These seven polypeptides co - purify by conventional ion - exchange chro - matography . Two of these proteins are the Acanthamoeba homologs of S . cerevisiae ACT2 and S . Pombe act2 , two un - conventional actins ( or actin - related proteins ) . Several of these polypeptides are localized in the cortex of Acan - thamoeba by immunofluorescence . Unconventional actins have been identified previously in yeast and vertebrates ( reviewed by Herman , 1993 ) . From their sequences , they are clearly homologues of actin , but they are less than 50 % iden - tical to conventional actins , all of which have highly con - served primary structures . The 47 - and 44 - kD unconven - tional actins were discovered during sequencing of cloned DNA from two species of yeast ( Schwob and Martin , 1992 ; Lees - Miller et al . , 1992b ) . The vertebrate unconventional actins of 46 kD are found as part of a complex associated with the microtubule motor dynein ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1992a ) and concentrated near the centrosome ( Clark and Meyer , 1992 ) . Relatively little is known about the biochemi - cal properties and functions of the unconventional actins . Materials and Methods Profilin - Sepharose Chromatography A mixture of 30 mg profilin - I and profilin - II from Acanthamoeba castellanii ( 24 mg profilin - I , 6 rag profilin - O ) . was covalently linked to 10 g of CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B ( Fharmacia , piscataway , NJ ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . This affinity resin was used in a 1 . 5 x 30 cm column at 4°C . Acanthamoeba castellanii were grown in liquid culture , harvested by low - speed centrifugation and ' °700 g cells were lysed in either pyrophos - phate or sucrose buffer using a Parr nitrogen bomb ( Kern et al . , 1982 ) . These buffers have been used for more than 15 yr to solubilize actin , myosin - I , myosin - H , and many of the cell ' s actin - binding proteins . Pyre - phosphate buffer consisted of 150 mM KC1 , 12 mM sodium pyrophosphate ( NaPPi ) , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM benzamidine , 1 mM PMSF , 30 mM imida - zole , pH 7 . 0 , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 5 mM diisopropylfluorophosphate . Su - crose buffer contained 0 . 34 M sucrose , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM benzamidine , 1 mM PMSE Homogenates were centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 90 rain at 4°C . 50 / ~ 1 of a high - speed supernatant from a sucrose extract of Acan - thamoeba were loaded onto either a 10 mi profilin - Sepharose 4B affinity column or a control column of 10 ml Sepharose 4B with either no protein or an irrelevant protein ( a myosin II tail fragment ) coupled . Columns were washed in 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , until no protein could be detected by the Bradford protein assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) . The columns were eluted with a variety of different buffers as specified in the figure legends . Protein Purification Conventional Chromatography . Sucrose extracts of amoeba were chro - matographed on a column of DEAE - cellulose equilibrated with I0 mM im - idazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 , 0 . 1 mM benzamidine , 0 . 5 ram PMSF ( Tseng et ai . , 1984 ) . Pyrophosphate ex - tracts were dialyzed into 7 . 5 raM NaPPi , 10 mM Tris - C1 , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 6 mM PMSF before chromatography on the DEAE column equilibrated with 7 . 5 mM NaPPi , 10 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM dithiothrei - tel , and 0 . 6 mM PMSF . The 47 - kD polypeptide was purified as follows by ion - exchange chroma - tography from the fractions that flowed through the DEAE column . In a su - crose preparation , potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , was added to a concentra - tion of 20 mM . The DEAE flow - through was then applied to a 1 . 5 x 30 cm column ( 88 g ) of hydroxylapatite ( Bio - gel HTP , Bio - Rad Laboratories ) equilibrated with 1 liter 50 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , and washed with 200 ml 50 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 . This column was eluted with a 500 ml gradient of 50 - 400 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 . SDS - PAGE ( Laemmli , 1970 ) and immunoblotting were used to detect the pres - ence of the 47 - kD polypeptide in fractions eluting at " 0100 mM potassium phosphate . In the case of the pyrophosphate preparation , the peak fractions from the first hydroxylapatite column were pooled , dialyzed into 20 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , and re - loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column ( 1 . 5 × 30 cm ) equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , and eluted with a 500 mi gradient of 50 - 400 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 . Peak fractions were detected by immunoblotting , pooled , and dialyzed into 20 mM KCI , 20 mM Tris - C1 , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , and loaded onto a 1 . 5 × 30 cm column of phosphoceilulose ( Whatman , Maidstone , England ) pre - eqnilibrated with the dialysis buffer . This column was eluted with a 400 mi gradient of 20 - 500 mM KCI in 20 mM Tris - C1 , pH 7 . 5 . The 47 - kD polypeptide was identified by immunoblotting . As an additional step , we sometimes loaded peak fractions from the phosphocellulose column onto a 0 . 5 x 20 cm column of QAE - Sepharose ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM KC1 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothrei - tel , washed with 100 mM NaC1 , and eluted with 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris - C1 , pH 7 . 5 . Poly ~ L - Proline AjOinity Chromatography . The DEAE flow - through was fractionated by poly - L - proline Sepharose affinity chromatography ( Kaiser et al . , 1989 ) . Proteins eluted with 4 M urea were dialyzed into 10 mM im - idazole , pH 7 . 5 , 20 raM NaC1 . The proteins were chromatographed on the profilin - Sepharose affinity column and eluted with 0 . 4 M MgCI2 column buffer . Profilin was eluted from the poly - L - proline column with 8 M urea ( Kaiser et ai . , 1989 ) . Antibody Preparation and Purification A New Zealand white rabbit ( Bunnyville Farms , Littletown , PA ) JH30 was immunized subcutaneously in four locations with 47 - kD polypeptide purified by profilin - Sepharose chromatography and PAGE ( Fig . 1 , lane 12 ) . The gel was stained for I h with 0 . 2 % Coomassie blue , 0 . 1 % SDS , 25 mM " Iris base , 192 mM glycine , and destained for 10 - min each in two changes of deionized H20 . The gel slice was excised , frozen in liquid N2 , and pulverized to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle . The powder con - taining " 050 / ~ g protein was added to 0 . 5 ml Freund ' s complete adjuvant and sonicated for 30 s with a probe sonicator ( Branson , VWR , Bridgeport , NJ ) . This mixture was injected under the skin at 0 and 6 wk after a preimmune bleed . Antibodies from rabbit JH30 bound to one band on immunoblots of cell extracts ( Fig . 2 , lane A ) . A polyspecific serum to the polypeptides that copurilied with the 47 - kD polypeptide , was prepared by immunizing rabbit JH43 with 500 / zg of pro - tein purified by ion - exchange chromatography ( Fig . 3 ) in Freund ' s complete adjuvant boosting with antigen in Freund ' s incomplete adjuvant after 6 wk . Rabbit JH43 produced antibodies to most of the injected polypeptides ( Fig . 2 , lane B ) . From this complex serum we affinity - purified antibodies to the individual polypeptides ( not attempting to separate the 19 - and 18 - kD anti - gens ) using immunoblot strips ( Pollard , 1984 ) . Mock - purification of im - mune serum was carded out in an identical fashion with nitrocellulose strips from an immunoblot in a region containing no protein . Purified 47 - kD anti - body recognized one band at 47 kD on immunoblots of Acanthamoeba ex - tracts ( Fig . 2 , lane C ) and affinity purified 19 / 18 - kD protein recognized one band ( or a close - running doublet ) ( Fig . 2 , lane D ) . Purified antibodies to 44 - , 40 - , 35 - , and 13 - kD polypeptides bound weakly to their antigens and had high backgrounds on immunoblots , so they had limited usefulness . Antibodies to Acanthamoeba profflin were purified from previously characterized antisera of rabbits JH15 and JHI6 ( Tseng et ai . , 1984 ) using immunoblots containing recombinant Acanthamoeba profflin - I and prafilin - II ( Aline et al . , 1994 ) . Mouse monoclonai antibodies ( 4D6 ) that react with amoeba actin were obtained from Sigma Immunocbemicals ( St . Louis , MO ) and Dr . James Lessard of the University of Cincinnati ( Cincinnati , OH ) ( Lessard , 1988 ) . Crude extracts for immunoblotting were prepared from a variety of cells . Live Dictyosteliwn discoideum and Acanthamoeba were lysed in boiling SDS - PAGE sample buffer ( 10 % wt / vol SDS , 1 M Tris - Cl , pH 6 . 8 , 50 % vol / vol glycerol , trace bromophenol blue , 5 % vol / vol 2 - mercaptoethanol ) . Conventionally purified actin ( Spudicb and Watt , 1971 ) was obtained from rabbit muscle acetone powder . Approximately equal protein loads as deter - mined by the BCA assay ( Pierce Biocbemicals , Rockford , IL ) were applied to SDS - PAGE , and blotted onto nitrocellulose . After reaction with antibod - ies , the blots were washed and bound antibodies detected with the ECL che - miluminescence system ( Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights . , IL ) .

The column was washed with 100 ml of 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM KCI , and eluted with 10 ml of 400 mM MgC12 in the same buffer . No other polypeptides were detected after elution with 8 M urea . Fractions were monitored for protein using a Brad - ford ( 1976 ) assay . Volumes of flow through and elution peaks were equiva - lent . Immunoblots using antiserum JH 43 were quantitated and used to cal - culate the fraction of each polypeptide present in the two fractions . Comparable results were obtained in two separate experiments using differ - ent extracts , and with both profilin - I - and profilin - II - Sepharose . Gel Filtration Stokes ' radius was determined by the method of Siegel and Monty ( 1966 ) using a 1 × 120 cm column of Sephacryl S - 300 equilibrated at 40C with 75 mM KCI , 20 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , and calibrated with Sigma gel - filtra - tion standards ( carbonic anhydraso , bovine serum albumin , ~ - amylase , and apoferritin ) . ATP marked the salt volume and blue dextran mol wt 2 million the void volume . Analytical gel - filtration was carried out at 22°C on a 0 . 5 × 50 cm column of Sephadex G - 100 in 10 mM Tris - C1 , pH 7 . 5 , 75 mM KC1 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , with or without 5 M KSCN . Immunofluorescence Acanthamoeba castellanii were cultured in plastic dishes ( Becton Dickinson & Co . , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and processed for immunofluorescence ( Yonemura and Pollard , 1992 ) . Briefly , ceils removed from plastic dishes by shaking were allowed to grow overnight on glass coverslips and fixed for 5 min in a 2 % formaldehyde - methanol solution at - 20 " C . All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature . Cells were washed in PBS ( 0 . 15 M NaCI , 0 . 01 % NAN3 , 10 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 4 ) and in - cubated with a 1 : 1 dilution of purified first antibody and a 1 : 50 dilution of rhodamine - labeled goat anti - rabbit ( Organon Teknika , West Chester , PA ) . Crude preimmtme serum was used at a 1 : 500 dilution . Confoeal fluores - cence micrographs were taken with a Bio - Rad MRC 600 . Peptide Sequencing The proteins in the profilin - binding complex were separated by SDS - PAGE on a large gel ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Corresponding bands from several lanes were excised and applied to an elution and concentration gel ( Vandekerek - hove et al . , 1993 ) . The concentrated protein was blotted on Immobilon P membranes ( Millipore ) ( Bauw et al . , 1988 ) , treated with trypsin , and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and run on an Applied Bi - osystems gas phase sequencer ( model 470A ) equipped with an on - line FrH amino acid analysis system ( model 120A ) . Quantitation Gels and immunoblots were digitized and analyzed using Collage software ( Fotodyne , New Berlin , WI ) running on a Macintosh Quadra 650 com - puter . Results Several Polypeptides Bind to Profilin - Sepharose The vast majority of polypeptides in soluble extracts of Acan - thamoeba ( Fig . 1 , lane 1 ) flow through the affinity column with Acanthamoeba profilins coupled to agarose beads ( Fig . 1 , lanes 2 - 5 ) . A 43 - kD polypeptide , identified by microse - quencing as conventional actin , bound weakly and eluted with low - salt buffer and buffer containing 5 mM ATP ( Fig . 1 , lanes 6 - 11 ) . Polypeptides with molecular weights of 47 , 44 , 40 , and 35 kD bound and were eluted with a high - sait sorbed to the profilJn - agarose column . After washing with low - salt buffer , bound proteins were eluted 0 . 4 M MgCI2 . Arrows indicate the positions of the 47 - , 44 - , 40 - , 35 - kD polypeptides . Figure 1 .

Anti - actin antibodies did not cross - react on immunoblots with the 44 - kD species that eluted in high salt . KI eluted residual 47 - and 44 - kD poly - peptide from the column ( Fig . 1 , lane 15 ) . Several other polypeptides , including the low molecular weight polypep - tides shown in Fig . 1 ( lane 12 ) and a high molecular weight polypeptide shown in Fig . 1 ( lanes 12 and 15 ) were present variably in fractions eluted by high salt . The Bradford assay detected no protein eluting from a control Sepharose 4B column without coupled protein . Polypeptides that eluted from a control column of a myosin - II tall fragment coupled to Sepharose did not correspond in molecular weight to those that eluted from profilin - Sepharose , nor did they react with antiserum JI - I43 ( see below ) on immunoblots . The ex - periment in Fig . 1 used a mixture of amoeba profilins im - mobilized on the agarose . Columns with either pure pro - filin - I or profilin - II gave similar results . Polypeptides of 47 , 44 , 40 , and 35 kD copurified with profilin during chromatography on DEAE - cellulose and affinity chromatography on poly - L - proline . These as - sociated proteins were separated from profilin by elution of the poly - L - proline column with 4 M urea or 400 mM MgCI2 . ( The profilin eluted from the poly - L - proline col - umn with 8 M urea ( Kaiser et al . , 1989 ) . ) After removing the MgCI2 or the urea by dialysis , the 47 - , 44 - , 40 - , and 35 - kD polypeptides rebound to the profilin affinity column ( Fig . 1 , lane 16 ) . Binding of the complex to the profilin column was blocked by 30 # M profilin - I but not by 30 # M lysozyme . Fractions purified by poly - L - proline affinity chromatogra - phy contained variable amounts of polypeptides of ' ~ 19 and 13 kD . Purification of the Profilin - binding Protein Complex by Ion Exchange Chromatography A rabbit antiserum to the 47 - kD polypeptide reacted specifically with the 47 - kD polypeptide on immunoblots of amoeba extracts ( Fig . 2 , lane A ) and with polypeptides of the same size from Dictyostelium discoideum , conventionally purified rabbit muscle actin and rabbit muscle extracts ( not shown ) . However , neither the anti - 47 - kD antiserum nor purified anti - 47 - kD antibodies ( Fig . 2 , lane C ) reacted with actin on immunoblots of pure amoeba or rabbit actin or actin in crude extracts ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus we could use these antibodies to assay for the 47 - kD polypeptide during its purification by conventional chromatography . We were surprised that polypeptides of 44 , 40 , and 35 kD ( like those identified by profilin affinity chromatography ) copurified with the 47 - kD polypeptide through four ion ex - change columns ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , these fractions con - tained polypeptides of 19 , 18 , and 13 kD . Two different purification procedures produced the same complex of poly - peptides . We started the purification with a soluble extract , because an immunoblotting assay showed that the 47 - kD polypeptide was found primarily in the soluble fraction of cells lysed in either sucrose or pyrophosphate . First extracts were chro - matographed on DEAE - cellulose . About half of the 47 - kD polypeptide flowed through with profilin . The other half was eluted with KC1 along with actin ( Tseng et al . , 1984 ) . The flow - through fractions contained profilin and the 47 - kD pro - tein as shown in Fig . 1 ( lane 16 ) . These fractions were chro - matographed on hydroxylapatite and eluted with a linear gra - Figure 2 .

The 47 - kD polypeptide eluted in 150 mM potassium phosphate . ( Peak fractions from the pyrophosphate preparation were dialyzed into 20 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , and rerun on a second hydroxylapatite column . ) Peak fractions from hy - droxylapatite were run on phosphocellulose and eluted with a 20 - 500 mM linear KCI gradient . The 47 - kD protein co - purified with polypeptides of 44 , 40 , 35 , 19 , 18 , and 13 kD ( Fig . 3 A ) . Further chromatography of a pyrophosphate ex - tract on QAE - Sepharose did not separate these seven poly - peptides ( Fig . 3 B ) . Copurification of these seven polypep - tides through several ion - exchange columns suggested that they might form a complex that interacts with profilin . Poly - peptides purified in this way bound to profilin Sepharose and were eluted with buffer containing 0 . 4 M MgC12 . The yield of the seven polypeptides was about 1 mg from ~ , 700 g packed Acanthamoeba , from either sucrose or Figure 3 .

This is considerably less than routine yields of profilin ( 100 nag ) or actin ( > 200 nag ) from these extracts . Physical Properties of the Profilin - binding Complex The seven purified polypeptides eluted together as a single peak with a Stokes ' radius of 4 . 8 nm during analytical gel filtration . A spherical particle with a partial specific volume of 0 . 73 and this Stokes ' radius would have a molecular weight of 220 kD .

Peptides from the 44 - kD protein are similar to the predicted amino acid sequence of C . elegans act c ( Waterston et al . , 1992 ) and S . cerevisiae ACT2 ( Schwo b and Martin , 1992 ) . The 44 - kD polypeptide did not react with ac - tin antibodies on immunoblots and no actin peptides were detected in the 44 - kD band by microsequencing . The iden - tity of both amoeba proteins has been confirmed by sequenc - ing full length cDNAs ( Kelleher , J . , S . Atkinson , and T . D . Pollard , unpublished results ) . The 40 - kD Polypeptide Is Similar to the Ga Subunit of a Trimeric G Protein A 10 - amino acid polypeptide fragment of the 40 - kD protein ( Fig . 4 , peptide pl ) contains 5 amino acids which are identi - cal to a WIM0 motif ( Iniguez - Lluhi et al . , 1993 ) found in the 40 - kD GB subunit of a Dictyostelium G protein ( Pupillo et al . , 1988 ) . This G protein ~ - subunit is essential for aggre - gation of cells during the early stages of Dictyostelium devel - opment ( Lilly et al . , 1993 ) . Further sequence data will be required to confirm the identity of this amoeba protein . The partial peptide sequences of the 35 - , 19 - , and 18 - kD polypeptides are not similar to any proteins in the PIR data - base ( Fig . 4 ) . We were unable to obtain sequences of pep - tides from the 13 - kD protein . Antibodies to amoeba profilin did not react with the 13 - kD polypeptide or any of the other polypeptides in the complex . Stoichiometry of the Polypeptides in the Profilin - binding Complex Assuming equal dye binding , the 47 - , 44 - , 40 - , and 35 - kD polypeptides were present in equal amounts in the purified complex ( Fig . 3 , legend ) . The 19 - , 18 - , and 13 - kD compo - nents were substoichiometric and differed in the two prepa - rations that we quantitated ( Fig . 3 ) . We do not know the stoichiometry of the seven polypep - tides in the cell , but fractionation on the profilin - aflinity column suggests that some of these polypeptides are present in excess in the cell extract . First , when limiting amounts of extract are adsorbed to the profilin column , much of each of the polypeptides in the purified complex binds to the column , but different proportions of each flow through the column ( Fig . 5 ) . Nearly all of the 40 - , 35 - , 19 - , and 18 - kD components bound to the column , but 35 % of 47 kD and 20 % of 44 kD are unbound . Second , during the high - salt elution of the polypeptides bound to the profilin column , part of both unconventional actins trail behind the main peak of complex and are eluted by KI ( Fig . 1 , lanes 12 - 15 ) . The 47 - and 19 / 18 - kD Polypeptides Are Localized in the Cortex of Acanthamoeba Three members of the purified complex localize to filopodia and cortex of Acanthamoeba along with actin filaments and some of the profilin . Affinity - purified antibodies to 47 - kD unconventional actin stained filopodia and the cortex of Acanthamoeba ( Figs . 6 and 7 B ) strongly compared with the rest of the cytoplasm . By confocal microscopy 47 - kD uncon - ventional actin was concentrated in spots corresponding to filopodia on the free surface of cells ( Fig . 6 A ) and through - Machesky et al .

Purified antibodies to 44 - kD unconventional actin also stain the cortex and filopodia ( J . Kelleher , unpublished results ) . Antibodies to the 19 - and 18 - kD polypeptides stained filopodia and the cortex of Acamhamoeba ( Fig . 7 D ) strongly compared with the rest of the cytoplasm . Purified 19 / 18 - kD antibodies reacted only with polypeptides of this size on im - munoblots of amoeba extracts ( Fig . 2 , lane D ) . Mock - purified serum stained the cytoplasm and contents of vacu - oles weakly ( Fig . 7 F ) . Affinity - purified antibodies to the 44 - , 40 - , and 35 - kD polypeptides also stained the cortex , but these antibodies cross - reacted with the 47 - kD polypeptide on immunoblots , so they are not illustrated . Profilin and actin are concentrated in the cortex ( Fig . 8 , A - l ) along with the 47 - kD unconventional actin and 19 / 18 - kD polypeptides . Affinity - purified polyclonal antibodies to Acanthamoeba profilin - I and profilin - II stain the cytoplasm as observed previously ( Tseng et al . , 1984 ) but they also stain striking cortical patches . Fibroblasts also have cortical patches of profilin ( Buss et al . , 1992 ) . Purified antibodies from the sera of rabbits JH34 and JH35 gave the same result . Preimmune serum did not stain the cells at a dilution of 1 : 500 . A monoclonal antibody to actin ( Fig . 7 , F - I ) and rhodamine - phalloidin also stained the cortex and filopodia . By confocal microscopy this staining was more uniform than that with the anti - 47 - kD unconventional actin . Discussion Two unconventional actins with several other polypeptides from crude extracts of Acanthamoeba bind to profilin - aga - rose and copurify by ion - exchange chromatography . At least three of the seven are localized together in the cortex of Acanthamoeba . The unconventional actins are homologues of S . pombe act2 and S . cerevisiae ACT2 . We present the the first biochemical purification and initial characterization of members of these families of proteins . The evidence sug - gests that these unconventional actins interact with proteins of the actin cytoskeleton , specifically with profilin and con - ventional actin ( given the presence of 47 kD in actin purified from rabbit muscle ) . Given these associations and their es - Figure 6 . Localization of the 47 - kD unconventional actin in Acan - thamoeba by indirect immunofluorescence with affinity - purified antibodies .

Since amoeba is closer to the root of the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree than yeast or vertebrates ( Olsen and Woese , 1993 ) , the presence of the 47 and 44 kD unconven - tional actins in amoeba confirms that these proteins are an - cient and likely to be present in many eukaryotes . The se - quences of these two unconventional actins from yeast , amoeba and vertebrates are remarkably similar . They clearly stand apart from each other and conventional actins , which have at least 70 % amino acid identity from protozoa to plants , fungi , and animals . The 44 - kD unconventional ACT2 from S . cerevisiae is only 47 % identical to yeast actin ( Schwob and Martin , 1992 ) , but much more similar to its homologues from Dictyostelium ( S .

The 47 - kD unconventional act2 from S . pombe is only 35 - 40 % identical to conventional actins , including its own actl , but has similar 47 - kD homo - logues in cows ( Tanaka et al . , 1992 ) , Dictyostelium and Acanthamoeba . Properties of the Profilin - binding Complex The copurification of seven polypeptides through five con - ventional chromatography columns indicates that they form a relatively stable complex . The Stokes ' radius of the purified material is consistent with a globular complex con - taining one copy of each of the seven polypeptides , but more rigorous studies are required to establish the stoichiometry definitively . Some of the components of the complex , partic - ularly the 47 - and 44 - kD unconventional actins , appear to be in excess in cell extracts , so in the cell some of the seven polypeptides must be free or have associations outside of the complex . Unconventional actins are the best candidates in the com - plex for binding profilin . Since the complex bound to the Machesky et al .

Bar , 10 # m . profilin - attinity column more tightly than actin ( Fig . 1 ) , one or both of the unconventional actins may have a higher affinity for profilin than conventional actin . This will be tested once the individual components are purified in quanti - ties adequate for binding studies . Compared with conventional actin , the components of the complex are minor cellular proteins judging from affinity chromatography of cellular extracts on profilin - Sepharose ( Fig . 1 ) . Bovine act2 is also predicted to be a minor protein ( Tanaka et al . , 1992 ) . Clearly these proteins have a different role than conventional actins . Functions of Unconventional Actins To date only the actin - RPV / centractin class of unconven - tional actins has been studied biochemically . They represent a third class of unconventional actins , different from the two that we have isolated . These 46 - kD unconventional actins are reported to be concentrated in centrosomes and perinuclear regions of MDCK cells ( Clark and Meyer , 1992 ) . They are also part of the dynactin complex ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1992a ) , which co - purifies with cytoplasmic dynein ( Paschal et al . , 1993 ) and promotes dynein based motility of vesicles along microtubules ( Gill et al . , 1991 ; Schroer and Sheetz , 1991 ) . Our work establishes that two other unconventional actins , the 47 - kD homologue of S . cerevisiae ACT2 and the 44 - kD homologue of S . pombe act2 , are present in low concentra - tions in the cortex of amoebas , apparently in association with each other and a small number of other polypeptides . The low abundance of the complex and its association with profilin and actin in the cortex of the cell , suggest to us that the complex has a regulatory rather than a structural role in the cell . This suggestion is consistent with genetic studies in yeast . Overexpression of the budding yeast ACT2 gene for the 44 - kD unconventional actin results in large rounded cells that do not bud ( Schwob and Martin , 1992 ) . Deletion of this gene is lethal late in cytokinesis of budded cells . Deletion of the 47 - kD unconventional act2 gene from fission yeast is also lethal ( Lees - Miller , et al . , 1992b ) . Further work is required to learn whether the unconven - tional actin complex from the amoeba is regulated by profilin or regulates one of the known functions of profilin such as its interactions with actin or the phosphoinositide signaling pathway . Another possibility is that the unconventional ac - tins in the complex dimerize to form a cryptic nucleus for actin filament formation or an actin filament cap . The 40 - kD polypeptide or other components in the complex could regu - late these activities . We gratefully acknowledge Dr . James Lessard for the gif ~ of monoclonal antibody 4D6 .
