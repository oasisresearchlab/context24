These proteins consist of actin - binding domains that are separated and geometrically organized by different numbers of rod domains . The detailed molecular structure of the cross - linking molecules determines the structural and mechanical properties of actin networks in vivo . In this study , we systematically investigate the impact of the length of the spacing unit between two actin - binding domains on in vitro actin networks . Such synthetic cross - linkers reveal that the shorter the constructs are , the greater the elastic modulus changes in the linear response regime . Because the same binding domains are used in all constructs , only the differ - ences in the number of rod domains determine their mechanical effectiveness . Structural rearrangements of the networks show that bundling propensity is highest for the shortest construct . The nonlinear mechanical response is affected by the molecular struc - ture of the cross - linker molecules , and the observed critical strains and fracture stress increase proportional to the length of the spacing unit . actin cytoskeleton (cid:1) cross - linking molecules (cid:1) mechanical properties F or living cells , tight control of the structure and mechanics of their cytoskeleton is crucial for the cells to function properly . The dynamic and local reorganization of one of the major constit - uents , the actin network , is coordinated by various actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) . Cross - linking proteins are a major class of ABPs , consisting of actin - binding domains , which are separated and geometrically organized by different numbers of rod domains . Cross - linker molecules vary ( i ) in the type of actin - binding affinity caused by specific binding domains used and ( ii ) in the structure , number , and organization of their spacing rod domains . Both the geometrical structure and actin - binding affinity of ABPs are be - lieved to determine mechanical function in vivo ( 1 ) . Instead of classifying the ABPs by the mechanical function of the cross - linker molecules , the architecture of actin networks is commonly used for a classification of different cross - linking molecules . Whereas very short cross - linkers , such as plastin or fascin , are generally classified as bundling proteins , longer cross - linkers , such as (cid:1) - actinin or filamin , are thought to induce orthogonal isotropic networks . This qualitative classification does not consider the observed concen - tration dependence of the structural rearrangements in actin net - works ( 2 – 4 ) . Different phases , from isotropic cross - linked , com - posite , or purely bundled networks , have been predicted to occur depending on the interaction potential between rods and the concentrations of linkers and rods ( 5 , 6 ) . Nevertheless , the effect of the structural rearrangements on the mechanical properties of such cross - linked networks is not fully understood . Thus , a correlation of the specific molecular structure of the cross - linker to the resulting network structure and its mechanical response is of great impor - tance . For very rigid cross - linkers , such as scruin , structural rear - rangements were successfully related to macroscopic mechanical behavior ( 7 , 8 ) . However , for the biologically important class of compliant cross - linkers , a detailed description is still far from being obtained . Recently , small changes in the molecular structure of human filamins have been shown to especially affect the nonlinear behavior of actin networks ( 9 ) . For this class of ABPs , ( i ) the number of rod repeats , ( ii ) the rod domain structure , and ( iii ) variable actin - binding affinities are believed to be responsible for the different mechanical properties of the ABPs ( 1 ) . Although structural arrangements are difficult to quantify , the viscoelastic properties are reliably determinable . The dependence of the elastic moduli on the concentration of cross - linking molecules allows the quantitative characterization of the mechanical effectiveness of different cross - linking molecules . Therefore , the elastic moduli will depend on molecular structure , the binding affinities of the cross - linker , and the resulting structural phases . Consequently , a system - atic variation of the molecular structure of cross - linker molecules is needed to correlate the mechanical response of cross - linked net - works to the molecular structure of the cross - linkers . In this work , we relate the geometric structure of different cross - linking molecules with mechanical effectiveness . Synthetic cross - linker molecules based on the naturally occurring Dictyo - stelium discoideum filamin ( ddFLN ) and hisactophilin ( 10 ) are expressed , and the effect on the formation of orthogonal net - works and ordered bundles is observed . We demonstrate that the mechanical effectiveness of the different constructs in in vitro actin networks depends on the geometrical length of the con - structs , respectively on the number of spacing domains . Results We analyzed the elastic response and structure of networks , cross - linked by ddFLN ( also known as ABP120 ; GenBank accession no . XP (cid:1) 646669 ) and compared the obtained results with networks cross - linked by different synthetically constructed cross - linking molecules . For all networks we determined the frequency - dependent elastic modulus G (cid:1) and the loss modulus , G (cid:2) and extracted the quasiplateau modulus ( G 0 (cid:3) G (cid:1) at 5 mHz ) as a function of the molar ratio of cross - linker to actin ( R (cid:3) c xlink (cid:2) c actin ) . The filamin isoform ddFLN is a dimeric molecule , consisting of six tandem repeats of a 100 - residue motif ( rod domain ) with an Ig ( IgG ) fold and an N - terminal , 250 - residue calponin homology domain responsible for actin binding ( 11 , 12 ) . Both chains are arranged in an extended antiparallel fashion interconnecting the two actin - binding domains . The dimeriza - tion is mediated by the sixth domain , resulting in an end - to - end distance of (cid:4) 35 nm ( 13 ) . Conﬂict of interest statement : No conﬂicts declared .

In all constructs , hisactophilin was used as the actin - binding domain , and , in two cross - linkers , the length of the spacer region was varied by using different numbers of IgG repeats of ddFLN ( see Fig . 2 ) . Depending on the number of rod domains the different constructs were named HisAc - D2 - 6 ( rod repeats 2 – 6 ) and HisAc - D5 - 6 ( rod repeats 5 and 6 ) . To inves - tigate a cross - linker without any rod repeat , we constructed a nonspaced , chemically linked head - to - head dimer of hisactophi - lin , which was designated HisAc - S - S - HisAc . The junction point between the rod repeat ( ddFLN - 5 ) and the hisactophilin moiety in construct HisAc - D5 - 6 could be easily defined on the basis of the x - ray structure of ddFLN [ Protein Data Bank ID code 1WLH ( 14 ) ] , which shows the folding of repeats 4 – 6 . Because of the lack of structural information of the other rod domains of ddFLN , the junction point in construct HisAc - D2 - 6 had to be determined on the basis of a sequence alignment ( see Fig . 5 , which is published as supporting infor - mation on the PNAS web site ) . All constructs were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified by Ni - nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatog - raphy and gel filtration chromatography ( Materials and Methods ; see also Supporting Materials and Methods and Tables 1 and 2 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The purified proteins appeared homogeneous as judged by SDS (cid:2) PAGE . The binding properties of these constructs were systemati - cally checked in binding assays with different molar concen - trations of cross - linkers compared with actin molecules ( R (cid:3) c xlink (cid:2) c actin ) spanning more than one order of magnitude ( from 0 . 1 to 1 ) . After centrifugation of those mixtures , all cross - linking constructs were found to be totally incorporated into the actin network as shown by SDS (cid:2) PAGE ( see Fig . 6 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Thus , all of the cross - linking proteins have been immobilized by binding to the actin network . Consistently , none of the cross - linkers was detected in the supernatant , except when the construct was centrifuged in the absence of actin . Western blot analysis with monoclonal anti - hisactophilin antibodies ( 15 ) confirmed these results . These experiments clearly show the similar binding affinities of all three constructs under the experimental conditions . In addition to our synthetic recombinant constructs , we used the naturally occurring ddFLN in our experiments . Polymerizing actin in the presence of ddFLN resulted in a mainly isotropically cross - linked actin network . Electron micrographs show that , even at high concentrations of ddFLN isotropic networks , only a few embedded bundles are present . The bundles appear loosely packed and significantly curved ( Fig . 1 G ) . These structural observations depict that the elongated cross - linker ddFLN is rather ineffective in forming strong bundles of actin filaments . Because it is not possible to obtain a reliable quantification of the structural rearrangements from electron micrographs , we deter - mined the mechanical effect of the compliant cross - linker ddFLN on actin networks . In the linear response regime , ddFLN (cid:2) actin networks show only a weak frequency dependence for the loss ( G (cid:1) ) and storage ( G (cid:2) ) moduli , as can be seen in Fig . 2 D . The effectiveness of ddFLN in strengthening actin networks was determined by measuring the elastic modulus G 0 at 5 mHz at a given actin concentration ( c A (cid:3) 9 . 5 (cid:2) M ) . Fig . 3 shows that , above a critical concentration of ddFLN ( R * (cid:4) 0 . 01 (cid:5) 0 . 008 ) , the elastic modulus gently inclined with increasing cross - linker con - centration G 0 (cid:4) R 0 . 4 (cid:5) 0 . 3 ( Fig . 3 ) . Accordingly , the ddFLN is not only ineffective at bundling actin filaments but also has only a modest effect on raising the viscoelasticity of these networks . The question arises whether these observations can be related to the extended molecular structure of ddFLN . HisAc - D2 - 6 , which contains rod repeats 2 – 6 of ddFLN , was the longest synthetic cross - linker protein used in this study . Addition of HisAc - D2 - 6 cross - linker molecules resulted in an isotropically cross - linked network with curved and widely packed embedded bundles at high concentrations ( Fig . 1 B and F ) . Furthermore , rheological measurements showed that , below a transition concentration R * , the mechanical properties of the network are not affected by the addition of the cross - linker . However , above a critical concentration ( R * (cid:4) 0 . 0023 (cid:5) 0 . 0015 ) , increasing amounts of HisAc - D2 - 6 resulted in ( i ) an increase of the viscoelastic moduli , ( ii ) a flattening of the frequency depen - dence of the plateau modulus , and ( iii ) a shift in the crossover frequency ( Fig . 2 C ) . For all concentrations , the HisAc - D2 - 6 (cid:2) actin networks are predominantly elastic . As can be seen in Fig . 3 , the modest effect of the longest construct on the elastic properties of the network is comparable with that of ddFLN . Again , exceeding a critical concentration , G 0 increases weakly with the concentration of the cross - linker ( G 0 (cid:4) R 0 . 5 (cid:5) 0 . 2 ) . This similarity in mechanical effectiveness is obtained , although the actin - binding domains in ddFLN and HisAc - D2 - 6 are very different , which suggests that the spacing structure of the cross - linker molecules predominantly determines their mechan - Fig . 1 .

This result implies that the mechanical effectiveness should be affected by shortening the spacing domains without modifying the binding domains . Indeed , we observed that a stronger effect on the mechanical properties can be achieved with a decreased number of rod domains . The construct with two rod domains ( HisAc - D5 - 6 ) already has a significantly stronger effect on the elastic modulus of the network . When the critical concentration ( R * (cid:4) 0 . 0015 (cid:5) 0 . 0005 ) is passed , a remarkable increase as a function of cross - linker concentration is observed ( G 0 (cid:4) R 0 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 1 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . For the shortest cross - linker studied , a simple dimer of two hisactophilin molecules chemically fused by a disulfide bridge ( HisAc - S - S - HisAc ) , a high increase in the elastic modulus is observed for R (cid:9) 0 . 01 . Further increase in the cross - linker concentration causes the elastic modulus to change more than two orders of magni - tude and scale with R 1 . 2 (cid:5) 0 . 2 . Thus , at concentrations above the critical concentration , a clear dependence of the rheological behavior on the number of rod domains can be observed . This increased effectiveness of the shorter constructs in fortifying actin networks can be related to pronounced structural rear - rangements . In electron micrographs , a composite network was observed with a significant number of bundles embedded in an isotropic network of filaments above a concentration of R * (cid:9) 0 . 004 . The number of bundles increases with increasing concen - tration of the cross - linker molecules , and , at concentrations of R (cid:3) 0 . 1 , a percolation of bundles was observed . For HisAc - S - S - HisAc , a pure network of bundles was induced at R (cid:3) 1 . Interestingly , the structure of bundles , as observed by electron microscopy , also was closely related to the structure of the constructs . Whereas the shortest cross - linker induced dense and rather straight bundles , all structures observed after addition of the longest construct or of ddFLN seemed to be significantly bent and appeared fuzzier in the electron microscope pictures ( Fig . 1 ) . Below the transition concentration , a purely isotropic network was observed for all constructs studied . Consequently , the structural rearrangements and the mechan - ical effectiveness differ significantly between the constructs . The increase of the elastic modulus with increasing concentration of cross - linker molecules ( G 0 (cid:4) R x ) depends on the molecular mass ( MW ) and thus on the contour length of the cross - linker constructs . The MW dependence can in first order roughly be approximated by a power law : x (cid:4) MW (cid:10) 0 . 7 . For the threshold value , R * , no direct dependence was observable . . . . . . . . .

Considering the moderate effect on the linear mechanical response of the actin network , it may be surprising that living cells use ddFLN as a cross - linker . One important aspect could be that cross - linking actin networks by ddFLN adds additional compliances to the network that affect the nonlinear response . Indeed , the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of the networks depends strongly on the structure of the cross - linking molecules ( Fig . 4 ) . For all constructs , the onset of the nonlinear response regime (cid:4) crit and the fracture stress (cid:5) max was determined at a concentration of R (cid:3) 0 . 1 . As can be seen in Fig . 4 , (cid:4) crit was observed at increasingly higher strains the longer the construct was . Simultaneously , (cid:5) max , the stress at which weakening of the network was observed , depends significantly on the studied constructs . The longest cross - linkers were withstanding the largest stresses , attaining a stress up to 3 (cid:5) 0 . 4 Pa . In contrast , the shortest cross - linker ruptured first , reaching only 0 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 3 Pa . Concomitant with the differences in (cid:5) max for each cross - linker , the maximal absolute modulus is increased from 1 . 1 Pa for the shortest cross - linker to 2 . 2 Pa for HisAc - D5 - 6 and 4 . 5 Pa for HisAc - D2 - 6 . The increase of the (cid:4) crit and the maximal obtainable modulus depends almost linearly on the MW and thus the contour length of the constructs , as can be seen in Fig . 4 . Discussion The systematic variation of the molecular structure of cross - linker molecules shows that the geometry of the cross - linker determines the mechanical network fortification . Short cross - linker constructs result in composite networks in which isolated bundles are embed - ded in an isotropic network of single filaments . The short cross - linkers are most effective in enhancing the linear viscoelastic properties of actin networks . Longer constructs and ddFLN do not result in a significant increase of the linear elastic moduli , which can be attributed to their lower bundling propensity . For all cross - linker constructs studied , two regimes were distinguishable in the linear mechanical response : ( i ) one regime with no remarkable increase of the viscoelastic moduli and ( ii ) another regime with an increase of the plateau modulus G 0 correlated with the concentration of cross - linkers . Because the binding affinity is the same for all of the constructs , the differences in the mechanical response of the networks are affected by the number of rod domains and thus the resulting compliance . The structural transition from a weakly isotropically cross - linked network to a strongly isotropically cross - linked network or to a composite network with embedded bundles depends on the geometrical structure of the ABPs . Because of the relatively lower entropic cost associated with cross - linking two filaments , the longer constructs cross - link filaments already at lower concentrations than the shorter constructs but with an impeded bundling efficiency ( 5 ) . The short - range interaction of shorter constructs results in an increased cooperativity favoring bundling with the transition occurring at higher concentrations . It is important to point out that , although the binding constants of all constructs are kept constant , the molecular structure sensitively affects their effectiveness in bundling , which requires simultaneous binding of both actin - binding domains and there - fore may be easiest for the shortest construct . For the almost covalent and rigid cross - linker scruin , the observed increase of the moduli of G 0 (cid:4) R 2 and its observed transition at R * (cid:3) 0 . 01 are in excellent agreement with the shortest cross - linker in the present study ( 8 ) . Depletion forces induce a direct transition from an isotropically cross - linked network to a pure bundle phase , in which the moduli increase as G 0 (cid:4) R 3 . 5 ( 16 ) . These results suggest that the increase of the moduli as a function of concentration in the second regime can be understood as a measure of the bundle propensity that dominates the mechanical effectiveness . Furthermore , it is important to keep in mind that not only the number of rod repeats but also their structure and the degree of dimerization determine the compliance of a cross - linker mole - cule . For example , in (cid:1) - actinin , the spacing domain is composed of four repeats ( based on a triple - stranded , coiled - coil (cid:1) - helix called spectrin domain ) , which are completely dimerized , result - ing in a presumably rigid rod of a contour length of (cid:4) 36 nm . This cross - linker increases the linear elastic modulus of cross - linked networks quite effectively : G 0 (cid:4) R 2 . 4 ( 3 ) or G 0 (cid:4) R 1 . 7 ( 17 ) , and , for different long isoforms of (cid:1) - actinin , significant differences in bundling propensity were observed ( 18 ) . In addition , the nonlinear response regime of actin networks is drastically affected by cross - linker proteins ( 7 , 19 ) . Once a critical strain is passed , further increase of the strain on actin (cid:2) cross - linker Fig . 3 .

WhereasddFLNcross - linked networks harden by a factor of 10 , the shortest cross - linker con - struct results only in a modest hardening response , almost compa - rable with pure actin networks , before weakening of the network was observed . The structure of these networks and the increased compliance of the longer cross - linkers allow the network to with - stand higher shear stresses . Consistently , the critical strain (cid:4) crit , upon which a nonlinear response occurs , is linearly dependent on the MW of the cross - linker constructs ( Fig . 4 Inset ) . The fracture stress depends on the force redistribution inside the network , which was observed to depend on the MW and thus the length and compliance of the cross - linkers . Because the binding affinity is kept constant between the constructs , the measured differences have to be attributed to structural differences of the cross - linkers and the resulting networks . Recently , it was shown that a small difference in the molecular structure of human filamin isoforms has significant effects , especially in the nonlinear response of cross - linked net - works . Hinged filamins reached fracture stresses of 10 – 30 Pa , which were 10 - fold higher than for nonhinged filamins ( 9 ) . For all cross - linker molecules under study , composite network structures were observed in which nonpercolating bundles were integrated in an isotropic network below R (cid:4) 0 . 1 . The electron micrographs suggest that the bundle stiffness depends on the cross - linker used , which could be due to the limited number of filaments inside the ddFLN cross - linked bundles or an increased flexibility between the bundled filaments cross - linked by ddFLN or HisAc - D2 - 6 ( 20 , 21 ) . Therefore , one has to understand how the different compliant bundle structures installed in actin networks affect their mechanical viscoelastic properties . So far , analytical theories fail to describe such composite networks due to the lack of information about the stress distribution over the heterogeneous structural elements ( 22 , 23 ) . Recently introduced mesoscopic sim - ulations of such networks appear to offer the promise of quanti - tatively describing the underlying physical principles ( 24 , 25 ) . On the basis of well defined synthetic constructs , we were able to correlate the macroscopic mechanical behavior of cross - linked actin networks with the structure and geometry of actin cross - linking proteins . The observed dependence of the linear elastic properties and the phase behavior on the molecular structure exemplifies how single - molecule properties affect the macroscopic behavior of networks . Because the mechanical properties of the rod domain of ddFLN are well studied ( 26 ) , such a bottom - up strategy appears to offer the promise of bridging the gap between the understanding of properties of single molecules and complex materials . Materials and Methods Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt ( ref . 27 ; see also Supporting Materials and Methods ) . All cross - linker constructs were expressed in E . coli , and ddFLN was purified from D . discoideum cells ( see Supporting Materials and Methods ) . The different cross - linking proteins ( ddFLN , HisAc - D2 - 6 , HisAc - D5 - 6 , or HisAc - S - S - HisAc ) were added in a molar ratio of cross - linker to actin ( R (cid:3) c xlink (cid:2) c actin ) from 1 : 10 , 000 to 1 : 1 before initiating polymerization . All measurements were per - formed at room temperature ( 21°C ) . Samples were gently mixed with pipettes with a cutoff tip . The samples for transmission electron microscopy ( EM 400T ; Philips , Eindhoven , The Neth - erlands ) were adsorbed ( 60 s ) to glow - discharged , carbon - coated formvar films on copper grids that were washed in a drop of distilled water ( 60 s ) before negative staining ( 60 s ) with 0 . 8 % uranyl acetate . Excess liquid was drained with filter paper to the edge of the grid , which was subsequently permitted to air dry . The bulk rheological measurements in the linear response regime were performed with a self - built , magnetically driven , rotating - disk rheometer . A sample volume of 400 (cid:2) l was covered with a phospholipid monolayer of dimystriolphosphatidyl - choline dissolved in chloroform to prevent denaturation of actin at the air – water interface . G - actin polymerization was induced by adding 10 - fold F - buffer ( Supporting Materials and Methods ) , and , after 2 min of gentle mixing , the polymerizing actin was transferred to the sample cuvette and the lipid layer was spread on the surface . After evaporation of the solvent of the lipids for 2 min , the rotating disk was placed onto the sample , and the cuvette was covered with a glass slide to eliminate any evapo - ration effects . All rheological experiments were performed after 2 h of polymerization at room temperature . We detected the frequency - dependent moduli G (cid:1) ( f ) and G (cid:2) ( f ) in a frequency range from f (cid:3) 1 Hz to 5 mHz for all samples studied . To obtain the scaling factor x , it was crucial to determine the threshold concentration of the cross - linkers ( R * ) , which was done by considering the typically observed measurement error in G 0 of 0 . 01 Pa , which sets the range of all possible R * . For this range , a power - law fit was applied to the data , and from all possible slopes the scaling factor x and its error were determined . The nonlinear regime was probed with a Physica MCR301 ( Anton Paar , Graz , Austria ) stress - controlled macrorheometer . All measurements were done with plane plate geometry of 50 mm in diameter and gap width of 160 (cid:2) m at a constant temperature of 21°C . A sample volume of 517 (cid:2) l was pipetted on the base plate . After polymerizing the sample for 1 h , a constant shear rate ( d (cid:4) (cid:2) dt (cid:3) 12 . 5 % per second ) was applied for 40 s while the resulting stress was recorded . We thank Klaus Kroy and Mark Bathe for many fruitful discussions , M . Rusp for technical assistance in actin purification , and Michael Schleicher ( Ludwig - Maximillians University , Munich , Germany ) for supplying ddFLN .
