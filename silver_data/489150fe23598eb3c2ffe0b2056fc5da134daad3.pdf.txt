Optically distinguishing lipid raft domains in cell membranes would greatly facilitate the investigations on the structure and dynamics of raft - related cellular behaviors , such as signal transduction , membrane transport ( endocytosis ) , adhesion , and motility . However , current strategies about the visualization of lipid raft domains usually suffer from the low biocompatibility of the probes , invasive detection , or ex - situ observation . At the same time , naturally derived biomacromolecules have been extensively used in biomedical field and their interaction with cells remains a long - standing topic since it is closely related to various fundamental studies and potential applications . Herein , noninvasive visualization of lipid raft domains in model lipid bilayers ( supported lipid bilayers and giant unilamellar vesicles ) and live cells was successfully realized in - situ using fluorescent biomacromolecules—the fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labeled glycol chitosan molecules . We found that the lipid raft domains in model or real membranes could be specifically stained by the FITC - labeled glycol chitosan molecules , which could be attributed to the electrostatic attractive interaction and / or hydrophobic interaction between the probes and the lipid raft domains . Since the FITC - labeled glycol chitosan molecules do not need to completely insert into the lipid bilayer and will not disturb the organization of lipids , they can more accurately visualize the raft domains as compared with other fluorescent dyes that need to be premixed with the various lipid molecules prior to the fabrication of model membranes . Furthermore , the FITC - labeled glycol chitosan molecules were found to be able to resist cellular internalization and could successfully visualize rafts in live cells . The present work provides a new way to achieve the imaging of lipid rafts and also sheds new light on the interaction between biomacromolecules and lipid membranes .

For example , the estimates of lipid raft domain size are controversial , with reported values varying from 10 to 300 nm 10 , 11 , 14 and even to several micrometers . 12 The large deviation may be related to different techniques , cell types , and probe molecules . 13 Currently there are only several techniques that are suitable for studying lipid rafts , such as nuclear magnetic resonance , 15 – 17 mass spectrometry , 18 – 20 atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , 14 , 21 – 24 and optical imaging techniques 25 . Within these techniques , the last two are the only common techniques that can directly visualize the lipid raft boundaries in situ under ambient conditions . Since a lipid bilayer is not stable in air , the direct observation of lipid raft bilayers must be carried out under water . Even though AFM experiments have been widely performed , the AFM operation has more vigorous requirements for samples and experiences compared to optical imaging . Therefore , with its fast , noninvasive , and in - situ labeling advantages , optical imaging method is believed to be powerful for imaging lipid raft domains , 26 especially with the development of confocal and two - photon fluorescence microscopic imaging techniques .

Commonly used probes include fluorescent lipids that can selectively partition into liquid ordered or disordered phases , 27 , 28 local viscosity - responsive fluorescent dyes that change their fluorescence intensity in different lipid phases 29 and polarity - sensitive dyes . 30 – 32 Besides , fluorescent antibodies that bind to raft - specific membrane proteins ( such as CD90 ( Thy - 1 ) , CD59 , and caveolin - 1 ) or cholesterol ( using anti - cholesterol monoclonal immunoglobulin G ) , and fluorescent cholera toxin B that binds to GM1 gangliosides have also realized the visualization of lipid rafts . 33 , 34 However , disruption to lipid rafts , immatureness , and even mispartitioning 26 , 35 , 36 significantly limit the application of the conventional probes . For fluorescent lipids , the most frequently used raft probes , bind preferentially to liquid - disordered phase , not lipid raft domains . 26 , 27 Besides , these lipid - like dyes need to be pre - incorporated into the lipid components when preparing model raft membranes , making the in - situ observation of the lipid rafts impossible . Hence , the development of alternative fluorescent probes for lipid rafts research is necessary . Herein , we proposed a simple method to visualize lipid rafts by using fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labeled glycol chitosan , and realized the highly specific imaging of the lipid raft domains ( Figure 1 ) . Model lipid membranes prepared in the form of supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) 37 – 47 and giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) 48 – 54 were applied as the platforms for imaging phase - separated lipid raft domains using confocal fluorescence microscopy . Glycol chitosan , a naturally derived biomacromolecule , is highly biocompatible and is soluble in aqueous solution at a wide pH range . 55 , 56 The excellent water solubility of this molecule endows its ease of chemical modification . The conjugation of FITC to glycol Page 4 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 5 chitosan is very simple and only requires the control of solution pH at ~ 9 . 5 . The as - prepared glycol chitosan - FITC conjugate has a hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 21 . 6 nm in aqueous solution as measured by dynamic light scattering ( Figure S1 ) . By using the glycol chitosan - FITC molecules , wash - free in - situ visualization of lipid rafts was successfully achieved , without the need for premixing fluorescent dyes with lipid components when preparing model lipid raft membranes .

Size Characterization of Glycol Chitosan - FITC . Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out for the size characterization of glycol chitosan - FITC ( 100 µg / mL ) in Page 6 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 7 conventional phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( NaCl / KCl / Na 2 HPO 4 / KH 2 PO 4 , ~ 150 mM , pH = 7 . 4 ) at 25 °C using a Malvern Nano ZS Zetasizer . Preparation of Supported Lipid Bilayers ( SLBs ) . SLBs were prepared through the fusion of liposomes which were formed by the extrusion method . Firstly , DOPC / SM / Chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) powders were dissolved in chloroform to give a total lipid concentration of 4 mg / mL . LR - DOPE in chloroform was added to the above solution ( with a final concentraion of 1 mol % ) for selectively staining the DOPC - rich domains . Secondly , the organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas and the sample was further dried under vacuum overnight to remove the residual solvent . Next , the lipids were hydrated in deionized water and extruded through a 100 nm pore size polycarbonate membrane filter using an Avanti mini - extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) for 21 times . Then , suspension of liposomes was deposited onto the clean glass substrate that was already treated with oxygen plasma , and then incubated with a buffer ( 400 mM KCl , 4 mM Tris , and 2 mM CaCl 2 ; pH 8 . 0 ) for 2 h at 60 °C . Finally , excess lipids were removed by rinsing with one of the following buffer solutions : water , 0 . 9 % NaCl solution , 10 mM PBS ( Na 2 HPO 4 / NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) , and conventional PBS . SLBs consisting of DOPC only were prepared by the similar method stated above . Preparation of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles ( GUVs ) . Mixtures of DOPC / SM / Chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) containing 1 mol % of LR - DOPE were dissolved in chloroform to make a lipid solution with a final concentration of 4 mg / mL . Then we used spin coating to produce a thin , homogeneous film which was dried under vacuum overnight to evaporate the residual chloroform in the film . Subsequently , GUVs were formed by a widely used electroformation method according Page 7 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 8 to the literature . 54 In our experiment , the electroformation chamber between the two indium tin oxide ( ITO ) glasses was filled with buffer solution of 0 . 23 M sucrose . The electroformation process lasted for 2 h with a 3 V , 10 Hz ac field at 60 °C . After the completion of electroformation , the solution was gently removed from the chamber . Samples were diluted 3 times with an iso - osmolar solution of 0 . 23 M glucose and the density difference between sucrose ( inner pool ) and glucose ( external medium ) led to the settlement of GUVs onto the coverslip , which enabled the microscopic imaging of GUVs possible . Confocal Microscopic Observation . Confocal images of supported lipid bilayers and GUVs were taken with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope TCS SP8 ( Leica , Germany ) with a 63× oil immersion objective at room temperature . LR - DOPE and glycol chitosan - FITC were excited at 552 and 488 nm , respectively . Cell Culture and Incubation Experiment . MCF - 7 human breast cancer cells were seeded at a density of 10 4 cells per well in 8 - well plate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . ) and incubated at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 for 24 h . After washing with 0 . 9 % NaCl solution for 3 times , the cells were incubated with glycol chitosan - FITC ( 100 µg / mL ) at 37 °C for 15 min . Subsequently , the cells in each well were washed with 0 . 9 % NaCl solution and incubated with 200 µL phycoerythrin ( PE ) - conjugated anti - CD59 antibody solution that was diluted 50 - fold from stock solution in 0 . 9 % NaCl solution ( containing 4 % BSA ) . After 15 min , the cells were washed with 0 . 9 % NaCl solution for 3 times . Finally , 200 µL of 0 . 9 % NaCl solution was added into each well and then the 8 - well plate was examined under a confocal microscope . The excitation and emission of each channel were adjusted to a suitable value to avoid the interference between the two fluorophores ( FITC and PE ) .

SLBs with DOPC / SM / Chol ( molar ratio = 1 : 1 : 1 ) containing 1 mol % of LR - DOPE were prepared by the fusion of nano - sized liposomes ( ~ 100 nm ) formed through extrusion method . The thus formed lipid raft domains resembled those reported in previous studies . 23 , 24 , 49 , 57 The dark regions were the liquid - ordered lipid raft domains enriched in SM and Chol , while the red regions were the surrounding DOPC - rich liquid - disordered domains in which LR - DOPE were preferentially distributed 26 , 27 ( Figure 2A ) . We have first confirmed that the addition of glycol chitosan - FITC ( the final concentration is 100 µg / mL ) did not change the morphology of the bilayer since the confocal image in Figure 2A did not change before and after the addition of the polymeric dye . However , after the addition of the dye , we surprisingly found that the lipid raft domains were specifically illuminated ( Figure 2B and C ) . The line fluorescence intensities of panel A and B ( the white straight lines ) in Figure 2 at the same place were also recorded ( Figure 2D ) , with the red curve representing the red fluorescence intensity of LR - DOPE - staining DOPC - rich domains ( Figure 2A ) and the green curve representing the green fluorescence intensity of glycol chitosan - FITC - stained lipid raft domains ( Figure 2B ) . From the results , we can see that in every region if the green fluorescence intensity increased , the red fluorescence intensity would decrease , or vice versa , confirming that the glycol chitosan - FITC stained the lipid raft domains specifically .

Confocal images ( A – C ) of SLB consisting of DOPC / SM / Chol ( molar ratio = 1 : 1 : 1 , doped with 1 mol % LR - DOPE ) after the interaction with glycol chitosan - FITC ( 100 µg / mL ) excited at 552 nm ( A ) , 488 nm ( B ) , and the overlay ( C ) . ( D ) Line fluorescence intensity of the same place ( marked with straight white lines ) in ( A ) and ( B ) . The SLB was treated with glycol chitosan - FITC for 10 min . The red channel ( 552 nm ) shows the non - raft DOPC - rich regions containing LR - DOPE , while the green channel ( 488 nm ) shows the glycol chitosan - FITC stained raft regions . The black areas in ( C ) are some defect regions of the lipid bilayer . Before observed by the confocal microscope , the SLB was rinsed 3 times by 10 mM PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Scale bar is 10 µm . Note : The results represent the typical data obtained from three independent experiments . Although the size and morphology of the raft pattern may differ from batch to batch , the staining performance of the polymeric dye is always the same . To see if the polymeric dye ( glycol chitosan - FITC ) can be exclusively adsorbed onto the lipid raft domains in a fluorescent lipid - free lipid membrane , we also prepared an SLB consisting of DOPC / SM / Chol without LR - DOPE . Prior to the addition of glycol chitosan - FITC , no fluorescence could be seen when the bilayer was either excited at 488 nm Page 10 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 11 or at 552 nm ( Figure S2 , panel A ) . When excited at 488 nm , the lipid raft domains in the SLB displayed green fluorescence ( Figure S2 , panel B ) after interacting with 100 µg / mL glycol chitosan - FITC , confirming that the polymeric dye could successfully realize in - situ visualization of lipid raft domains . In addition , after adding glycol chitosan - FITC , we found that the fluorescence images did not change before and after washing the SLB 10 times by 10 mM PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) , indicating that the fluorescent polymers were still on the raft domains , enabling the wash - free and stable fluorescence imaging for lipid raft domains . To prove that the polymeric dye did adsorb onto a lipid bilayer , not the glass substrate , we carried out the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiment . The results ( Figure S3 ) revealed that the domains stained by glycol chitosan - FITC had the fluorescence recovery phenomenon , indicating that there were lateral mobile lipid molecules on the substrate . Collectively , we confirmed that the domains in which glycol chitosan - FITC preferentially adsorbed are lipid raft domains . Comparison between Different Biomacromolecules . To elucidate the lipid raft specific staining mechanism of glycol chitosan - FITC , we prepared lysozyme - FITC and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) - FITC conjugates . Considering that the isoelectric points of lysozyme and BSA are 10 . 7 and 4 . 9 , respectively , lysozyme is positively charged while BSA is negatively charged at physiological pH ( 7 . 4 ) . After interacting with 100 µg / mL BSA - FITC , the whole SLB consisting of DOPC / SM / Chol ( molar ratio = 1 : 1 : 1 , doped with 1 mol % LR - DOPE ) excited at 488 nm emitted negligible green fluorescence after washing treatment ( Figure 3B ) , indicating that almost no BSA - FITC molecules were adsorbed onto the lipid bilayer . However , after interacting with 100 µg / mL lysozyme - FITC , the SLB excited at 488 nm Page 11 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 12 showed strong green fluorescence only in lipid raft domains ( Figure 3D – F ) . To further evaluate whether the electrostatic interaction plays a role in raft staining , we used 500 mM NaCl solution to wash the SLB that had been pretreated with glycol chitosan - FITC , and the results in Figure S4 showed that the fluorescence of glycol chitosan - FITC decreased to half of its original value , indicating that the binding between glycol chitosan - FITC and SLB could be weakened by salt screening . Such a salt screening weakened binding is a typical characteristic of electrostatic interaction . Besides , the remaining fluorescent dyes on SLBs may indicate that other interactions , such as the hydrophobic insertion of FITC moieties into the raft region , may also affect the interaction between glycol chitosan - FITC and raft domain . Therefore , we proposed that the selective staining of lipid raft domains by glycol chitosan - FITC might be attributed to the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between biomacromolecules and lipids . Besides , we have also verified that both glycol chitosan - FITC and lysozyme - FITC can successfully stain lipid raft domains in SLBs in pure water , 0 . 9 % NaCl solution , 10 mM PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) , and conventional PBS ( ~ 150 mM , pH 7 . 4 ) , indicating that the interaction is strong enough for successful adsorption of the biomacromolecules onto the lipid raft domains .

Confocal images of SLBs consisting of DOPC / SM / Chol ( molar ratio = 1 : 1 : 1 , Page 12 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 13 doped with 1 mol % LR - DOPE ) after the interaction with 100 µg / mL BSA - FITC ( A – C ) or lysozyme - FITC ( D – F ) excited at 552 nm ( A , D ) , 488 nm ( B , E ) , and the overlay ( C , F ) . The SLBs were treated with 100 µg / mL BSA - FITC or lysozyme - FITC for 10 min . The red channel ( 552 nm ) shows the non - raft DOPC - rich regions containing LR - DOPE , while the green channel ( 488 nm ) shows the BSA - FITC or lysozyme - FITC stained raft regions . Before observed by confocal microscope , the SLBs were rinsed 3 times by 10 mM PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Scale bar is 20 µm . Note : The results represent the typical data obtained from three independent experiments . Furthermore , to prove that the formation of heterogeneous structures in the SLB consisting of DOPC / SM / Chol ( molar ratio = 1 : 1 : 1 , doped with 1 mol % LR - DOPE ) is due to the lipid phase separation , we prepared an SLB of DOPC ( doped with 1 mol % LR - DOPE ) using the same preparation method . Compared to the DOPC / SM / Chol SLB , the SLB consisting of DOPC was homogeneous ( Figure 4 ) . This implied that the preparation method of the SLB was reliable and the lipid phase separation occurred due to the intermolecular interactions between the various lipids in DOPC / SM / Chol bilayer . Besides , after addition of glycol chitosan - FITC , a negligible green fluorescence could be observed on the DOPC bilayer ( Figure 4 ) , further demonstrating that the DOPC - rich domain cannot be stained by the polymeric dye . Moreover , to test the binding ability of glycol chitosan - FITC to different lipid components , SLBs consisting of DOPC , SM / Chol , or DOPC / SM / Chol without fluorescent lipid doping were also prepared , and the results in Figure 5 show that glycol chitosan - FITC can preferentially bind to the SM / Chol region .

The SLB was treated with glycol chitosan - FITC at a final concentration of 100 µg / mL for 10 min . Before observed by confocal microscope , the SLB was rinsed 3 times by 10 mM PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) .

To see whether glycol chitosan - FITC can visualize the lipid raft domains in a more cell - like geometry , GUVs composed of DOPC / SM / Chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) containing 1 mol % of LR - DOPE were prepared and observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope after interacting with 20 µg / mL glycol chitosan - FITC . The appearance of the fluorescent lipid - labeled GUVs ( Figure 6 ) was similar to that in the previous work . 36 The confocal imaging results of GUVs also indicate that glycol chitosan - FITC could stain lipid raft domains preferentially ( Figure 6 ) , in line with that of SLBs ( Figure 2 ) . Besides , Page 14 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 15 LR - DPPE - labeled GUVs and non - fluorescent GUVs were also prepared to further confirm the selective binding of glycol chitosan - FITC to the liquid ordered raft domains in GUVs ( Figure S5 ) .

To further study whether glycol chitosan - FITC can visualize lipid raft domains in live cells , human breast cancer cells ( MCF - 7 ) were co - treated with glycol chitosan - FITC and a commercial lipid raft probe , phycoerythrin ( PE ) - conjugated anti - CD59 antibody . PE - conjugated anti - CD59 is a fluorescent antibody that can selectively target the raft marker CD59 in live cells . 9 , 34 Figure 7 shows that the green dots of glycol chitosan - FITC co - localized with the red dots of PE - conjugated anti - CD59 , indicating that glycol chitosan - FITC can be used as a fluorescent probe for rafts in live cells . As a control , we have also evaluated the staining effect of lysozyme - FITC molecules but found that they were internalized by cells within several minutes . Thus glycol chitosan - FITC molecules are especially useful for raft staining since they can resist cellular endocytosis for Page 15 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Langmuir 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 16 at least several hours ( which can be confirmed by the time - dependent confocal imaging results in Figure S6 ) . Besides , to exclude that the stained dots are the endocytosed glycol chitosan - FITC molecules , we carried out the staining procedure at 4 °C since a lower temperature would inhibit the endocytosis . Results in Figure S7 show that glycol chitosan - FITC can still stain the raft domain of cells even when the active cellular internalization was inhibited , indicating that these fluorescent dots did not come from the endocytosed glycol chitosan - FITC molecules . Furthermore , we found that the green dots of glycol chitosan - FITC had a smaller co - localized area with the red dots of PE - conjugated anti - CD59 in conventional PBS ( data not shown ) compared to that in NaCl solution , indicating that glycol chitosan - FITC had a weaker interaction with lipid rafts in conventional PBS , mainly because that glycol chitosan , with the isoelectric point value of 8 . 8 , 58 does not have enough positive charges in conventional PBS with a pH value of 7 . 4 . While the lower pH value ( 6 . 0 – 6 . 5 ) of 0 . 9 % NaCl solution ensures sufficient positive charges of glycol chitosan , enabling a better staining performance of lipid rafts in NaCl solution . This difference between model membranes and live cells in the raft staining results could be attributed to the complexity of live cell surfaces , where glycol chitosan - FITC may interact with the negatively charged sialic acid - rich glycolipids or glycoproteins in raft domains .

CONCLUSION In summary , the present work developed a facile way to visualize lipid raft domains in situ in model lipid bilayers existing either as an SLB or a GUV . Positively charged fluorescence - labeled biomacromolecules such as glycol chitosan - FITC or lysozyme - FITC can successfully distinguish the lipid raft domains mainly via the electrostatic attraction interaction between biomacromolecules and raft lipids . However , we cannot rule out the role the hydrophobic interaction between the FITC moieties of the biomacromolecules and raft lipids plays during the staining . Most traditional fluorescent dyes ( such as LR - DOPE in this work ) that can distinguish lipid raft domains employ the property of their different interaction affinities with saturated and unsaturated lipid molecules and are therefore not in - situ ( that is , these dyes need to be premixed with the various lipid molecules prior to the fabrication of model membranes ) . Besides , since these biomacromolecules do not need to insert into the lipid bilayer and will not disturb the organization of lipids , they can more accurately visualize the raft domains as compared with other fluorescent probes . Considering the size of glycol chitosan - FITC ( ~ 20 nm ) , glycol chitosan with a smaller molecular weight should be chosen to prepare smaller glycol chitosan - FITC conjugates to visualize smaller lipid rafts ( e . g . , < 50 nm ) . Furthermore , the FITC - labeled glycol chitosan was found to be able to resist cellular internalization and could successfully visualize rafts in live cells . Finally , with their good biocompatibility , 55 , 56 , 59 , 60 glycol chitosan derivatives hold a great promise in biological applications .
