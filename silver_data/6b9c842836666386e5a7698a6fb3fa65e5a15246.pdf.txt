Introduction The nanomechanical characterization of biological materials [ 1 – 8 ] , thin rigid ﬁlms [ 9 – 16 ] and soft matters [ 17 – 28 ] has been becoming increasingly important over the last two decades , because these materials are often too soft , fragile , inhomogeneous , or simply too small to be characterized through conventional , large scale mechanical tests . Nanoindentation is a suitable technique to analyze the local mechanical properties of very small , soft or thin samples [ 29 – 32 ] . Among the nanomechanical testing techniques , an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) can be used as a nanoinden - ter to obtain force – distance curves by applying very low loads in order to obtain small indentation depths . When force – distance curves are performed , an AFM probe is used as a nanoinden - tation tool , allowing the determination of elastic modulus of materials at the nanoscale By employing AFM for nanoindenta - tions , the possible damage of delicate samples like living cells or hydrogels can be avoided [ 1 , 2 , 6 ] and local mechanical measure - ments with a nanoscale lateral resolution can be performed on ﬁnely featured samples [ 29 ] . Recently , the atomic force microscopy ∗ Corresponding author . Tel . : + 39 0223993249 ; fax : + 39 0270638173 . E - mail address : raffaella . suriano @ polimi . it ( R . Suriano ) . ( AFM ) has found increasingly wide applicability to investigation of mechanical properties of synthetic and biological samples . A greater understanding of the appropriate probe in terms of can - tilever spring constant and tip shape as well as of the suitable theoretical model to be employed depending on samples exam - ined during AFM indentation experiments is essential to achieve a good and reliable estimation of Young’s modulus . AFM probes are manufactured with different spring constants and tip shapes , and their surfaces can also be functionalized to optimize the experimental protocol for the speciﬁc sample to be analyzed . On the other side , this technique is sensitive to the adhe - siveforcesoccurringbetweenthesampleandtheprobeduebothto the atomic interactions and the presence of an aqueous meniscus [ 33 – 36 ] . Tominimizetheseeffects , AFMnanoindentationsareoften carried out in an aqueous environment [ 1 , 6 , 7 , 17 , 20 , 25 ] , even if this methodcanhavesomedisadvantageslikethedifﬁcultsettingofthe laser on the cantilever , and the disturbed signal on the photodiode due to the refraction effects given by the water – air interface . The measurement of force – distance curves through AFM is obtained by recording the AFM cantilever deﬂection as a func - tion of its vertical displacement when the tip is pressed against the surface of the sample ( loading curve ) , and then removing it ( unloading curve ) at a given rate . The indentation depth can be derived from the experimental data , and corresponds to the dif - ference between the probe vertical movement and its deﬂection . The indentation measurements can be related to the elastic modu - lus of the sample . To obtain the Young’s modulus , it is necessary to applyamathematicalmodeldescribingthecontactbetweenthetip and the surface . Several theories describe the elastic deformation of the sample [ 33 , 36 – 39 ] , and the differences in the mathemati - cal equations mostly depend on the role played by the adhesion in the system under investigation . The classical Hertz model does not consider the adhesive contribution , and it is therefore appli - cable only when the adhesion interaction is negligible compared to the loading force , as in the case of stiff materials in dry environ - ment , orwhentheanalysisisconductedinanaqueousenvironment [ 33 , 37 , 38 ] . Other models were derived from the Hertz model for tests conducted in air , in particular the Johnson – Kendall – Roberts ( JKR ) and the Derjaguin – Müller – Toporov ( DMT ) that both consider the adhesive contribution in the outside ( JKR ) or inside ( DMT ) of the contact area [ 33 , 37 , 38 , 40 ] . In addition to these analytical mod - els , several instrumental factors such as tip shape , spring constant and z - piezoelectric scanner movement can largely inﬂuence the quantiﬁcation of the elastic moduli [ 41 – 44 ] . In this paper , an adaptable method to measure force – distance curves in air by means of an AFM instrument is presented for the determination of the Young’s modulus for a series of highly diversiﬁed polymeric materials , like hydrogels , sol – gel hybrids , thermoplastics , and elastomers . Actually , no careful investigation on the selection of the cantilever spring constant and geometrical features of AFM probes to achieve an optimal indentation range of diverse samples was presented so far in the scientiﬁc literature . In order to take into account the different stiffness and adhe - sion phenomena , a thorough evaluation and comparison of various mathematical models is however necessary and still to be accom - plished . In the present study , several mathematical theories such as Hertz , Sneddon , DMT , JKR and Pietrement – Troyon ( PT ) models are applied critically discussing their application limits and thresh - old . A proper probe selection in terms of spring constant and tip shape is also discussed for all the samples under investigation . In addition , a hydrophobic surface functionalization of the probe is developed and examined in order to minimize adhesion phenom - ena on soft samples . More speciﬁcally , the hydrophobic treatment of the tips was introduced to decrease capillary forces which cause high tip - surface adhesion . This surface modiﬁcation allowed the challenging evaluation of Young’s modulus of very soft and aque - oussamplesbyAFMindentationinair . Theresultsderivedfromthe AFM nanoindentation tests were compared with literature data or with independent determinations derived from dynamic mechan - ical measurements in order to evaluate their reliability . We believe thatthisstudywillthereforeprovidehelpfulandgeneralguidelines for the AFM nanoindentation measurements of elastic moduli in air for a wide range of polymeric materials with very diverse char - acteristics that encompasses very soft hydrogels and stiff hybrid organic – inorganic coatings . 2 . Theoretical background Different approaches were employed to determine the elastic modulus from indentation experiments . The classical theory for a spherical indenter of radius R on a planar surface was ﬁrst devel - oped by Hertz in 1882 [ 45 ] . Using the Hertz model , the relationship between the applied force , F and the elastic indentation depth ı is represented by the following equation : F = E tot R 1 / 2 ı 3 / 2 ( 1 ) where E tot is the total modulus , which is deﬁned as follows : 1 E tot = 3 4 (cid:2)(cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) E s + (cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 t (cid:4) E t (cid:5) ( 2 ) being E s , (cid:2) s and E t , (cid:2) t theYoung’smoduliandthePoisson’sratiosfor the sample and the tip , respectively [ 46 ] . By neglecting the defor - mation of the tip , which can be considered inﬁnitely stiff when compared to the sample , the Eq . ( 2 ) is simpliﬁed to : 1 E tot = 3 4 (cid:2)(cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) E s (cid:5) . ( 3 ) Starting from the classical Hertz theory , another equation suit - able for a conical indenter was proposed by Sneddon [ 47 ] and according to this model , F is related to indentation by : F = 2 (cid:3) tan ˛ E s (cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) ı 2 ( 4 ) where ˛ is the half - opening angle of an AFM conical tip . Using the Hertz and Sneddon models , adhesion phenomena are assumed to be negligible and do not affect the sample deformation . In case of interactions between tips and samples strongly inﬂu - enced by adhesion , both the Derjaguin – Müller – Toporov ( DMT ) [ 48 ] and the Johnson – Kendall – Roberts ( JKR ) models [ 49 ] can be employed for spherical tips . The DMT model is suitable for samples with small adhesion force , F ad and is represented by the following equation : F + F ad = 4 E s 3 (cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) R 1 / 2 ı 3 / 2 ( 5 ) where F ad can be also deﬁned as the pull - off force , at which the tip and the sample separate when being pulled apart . The DMT theory also predicts that the contact radius a between the tip and the sample and the indentation depth ı are given by : ı = a 2 R ( 6 ) a = (cid:6) R E tot ( F + F ad ) (cid:7) 1 / 3 . ( 7 ) When large adhesion phenomena are observed , the more com - plex JKR model can be used and expressed by the following equations : ı = a 2 R − 4 3 (cid:8) aF ad RE tot ( 8 ) a = (cid:9) R E tot (cid:10)(cid:11) F ad + (cid:11) F + F ad (cid:12) 2 (cid:13) 1 / 3 ( 9 ) In all AFM measurements the extent of indentation depends on the contact radius , tip radius and adhesion force eventually present [ 33 ] . Theappliedforceisdirectlyrelatedtothecantileverdeﬂection through the Hooke’s law : F = k ( d − d 1 ) ( 10 ) where k is the spring contact of the cantilever and d 1 is the zero - deﬂection point of the cantilever . The AFM does not provide direct measurements of force and indentation depth . The sample indentation ı is obtained by the dif - ference between the probe vertical displacement (cid:4) z = ( z − z 0 ) , and the AFM cantilever deﬂection (cid:4) d = ( d − d 0 ) , where z 0 and d 0 are , respectively , the zero indentation position of the z - piezo and of the cantilever , corresponding to the contact point : ı = ( z − z 0 ) − ( d − d 0 ) . ( 11 ) The point of zero applied force ( z 1 , d 1 ) and the zero indenta - tion point ( z 0 , d 0 ) are coincident only in Hertzian mechanics . By combining the Eqs . ( 1 ) or ( 4 ) with ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , the Hertz and Sneddon models can be thus expressed as follows , respectively : z = z 0 + ( d − d 0 ) + (cid:2) k ( d − d 0 ) 3 (cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) 4 E s R 0 . 5 (cid:5) 2 / 3 ( 12 ) z = z 0 + ( d − d 0 ) + (cid:2) k ( d − d 0 ) (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) 2 E s tan ˛ (cid:5) 1 / 2 . ( 13 ) A relationship between ı and F can be obtained using the Pietrement – Troyon ( PT ) model [ 50 ] , which describes adhesion dominated contact mechanics and includes the DMT and JKR mod - els as two limiting cases by means of a generalized transition equation . According to PT model , the DMT equation becomes : z = z 0 + ( d − d 0 ) + a 20 R (cid:2)(cid:8) 1 + k ( d − d 1 ) F ad (cid:5) 4 / 3 ( 14 ) where a 0 is the contact radius when F = 0 . Applying the Eq . ( 14 ) to the raw AFM curves , the value of a 0 is eventually determined and the modulus of the sample E s can be calculated by : E s = (cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) 3 F ad R 4 a 30 ( 15 ) obtained by setting F = 0 in Eq . ( 7 ) , substituting the deﬁnition of E tot given by Eq . ( 3 ) and solving for E s . The PT model gives the following expression for the JKR theory : z = z 0 + ( d − d 0 ) + a 20 R ⎛ ⎝ (cid:2) 1 + (cid:11) 1 + k ( d − d 1 ) / F ad 2 (cid:5) 4 / 3 − 2 3 (cid:2) 1 + (cid:11) 1 + k ( d − d 1 ) / F ad 2 (cid:5) 1 / 3 ⎞ ⎠ ( 16 ) and the modulus E s is obtained by setting F = 0 in Eq . ( 9 ) , substitut - ing the deﬁnition of ı and of E tot given by Eq . ( 8 ) and by Eq . ( 3 ) , respectively , and solving for E s , as follows : E s = (cid:3) 1 − (cid:2) 2 s (cid:4) 3 F ad R a 30 .

Ethanol , hydrogen peroxide ( 30 % w / w ) , H 2 SO 4 ( 95 – 97 % ) , 1 H , 1 H , 2 H , 2 H perﬂuorodecyltriethoxysilane ( PFDTES , 97 % ) , tetraethylorthosil - icate ( TEOS ) , hyaluronic acid solution salt from streptococcus equi - bacterial glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide , divinyl sulfone , and HPLC pure water were all purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Dimethyldichlorosilane ( DMDCS , 99 . 0 % ) and (cid:2) - propyl - isocyanate triethoxysilane were purchased from Fluka . Silicon wafers were purchased from SILTRONIC AG , and all the Esco ® microscope slides are from Erie Scientiﬁc LLC . Poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) samples ( Perspex XT , bulk samples from injection molding ) were supplied from Lucite . Fs 36 S 62 is an experimental organic – inorganic hybrid coating synthesized by sol – gel chemistry and applied on cleaned glass substrates as described previously [ 51 ] . In brief , this particular hybrid material consists of 36wt . % of a ﬂuorocar - bon resin ( Lumiﬂon LF - 910 from Asahi Glass , Japan ) , which is a chlorotriﬂuoroethylene – vinylether copolymer used as base ﬂuo - ropolymer , 1 . 6wt . % of SiO 2 wt . % derived from the functionalization of ﬂuoropolymer resin with (cid:2) - propyl - isocyanate triethoxysilane and 62 . 4wt . % of SiO 2 derived from TEOS [ 51 ] . Polydimethylsilox - ane ( PDMS ) samples ( Sylgard184 , DowCorningCorporation ) witha thickness of 1mm were obtained using a two - component heat cur - ing system , composed of a pre - polymer and a cross - linker ( curing agent ) . In this study , the pre - polymer was mixed with the curing agent in the weight ratio of 10 / 1 . Hyaluronic acid hydrogels ( HA ) were diluted in NaOH 0 . 5M solutions up to 3 % w / v solid . Divinyl sulfone ( DVS ) was added as a crosslinker in separate experiments ( 5 / 1 molar with respect to HA primary hydroxyls ) , and crosslinked at 40 ◦ C for 24h before testing . Samples with various thickness ( 0 . 4 – 2mm ) were obtained by casting [ 52 ] . 3 . 2 . AFM measurements and data ﬁtting Every force – distance curve was obtained in air by means of an NSCRIPTOR TM atomic force microscope ( NanoInk , Inc . , Skokie , IL ) . TheNSCRIPTOR TM instrument , designedanddevelopedforDip - Pen Nanolithography applications , is provided with a closed - loop cor - rection , which consists in a piezo scanner ﬁtted with a secondary monitoring system that has its own feedback loop . This allows the closed - loop scanner to perform with a high degree of linearity , as also certiﬁed in the NanoInk datasheet ( Supplementary mate - rials ) . In addition , to correct time - independent non - linearity of the scanner , before any experimental round , a linearization procedure available in the SPMCockpit was carried out , determining the opti - mum linear range of the x – y feedback sensors ( x – y area in which thescanneriscurrentlylinear ) . Alltheprobeswerepurchasedfrom AppNano ( Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Every curve was performed with a tip rate of 0 . 05Hz and evaluated using the Cockpit ® software . Fitting of the raw AFM curves was carried out by means of Orig - inPro 8 . 5 software and the quality of the ﬁtting was evaluated in terms of coefﬁcient of determination R 2 ( the maximum number of iterations was set to 400 for each ﬁtting ) . For the ﬁtting , all the datasets were ﬁrstly restricted so that the maximum penetration depth of the tip into the sample was acceptable for the mathemat - ical models considered . In particular , for the Hertz , DMT and JKR model , this implies that the maximum penetration depth should be comparable to the tip radius . The datasets were then limited to the beginning of the experimental range in order to consider not onlytheelasticpartofdeformationsbutalsoarangeofindentations lower than 0 . 1 % of sample thickness . This prevented the stiffness of substrates from affecting modulus measurements of samples . The datasets were lastly selected from a statistical point of view . The adjusted R 2 coefﬁcientwascomparedfordifferentdatasetsinorder to select a dataset with an adjusted R 2 value higher than 0 . 99 . This coefﬁcient was considered as a reliable measure of the goodness of interpolation , and is deﬁned by the following equation : adjusted R 2 = 1 − (cid:18) ni = 1 ( y i − (cid:5) y ) 2 / ( n − k ) (cid:18) ni = 1 ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 / ( n − 1 ) ( 18 ) where y i and (cid:5) y are the original measured data values and modeled values , respectively , ¯ y is the mean of the observed data , n is the number of dataset points and k is the number of parameters calcu - lated by the interpolation . As shown by the Eq . ( 18 ) , the adjusted R 2 value allows for the number of dataset points that corresponds to the size of the considered range and it is higher by increasing the number of dataset points . This method , therefore , avoided a very small portion of curves being selected . 3 . 2 . 1 . Probes calibration All probes were calibrated by applying a load on a substrate ( a piranha - cleaned Si surface ) , much stiffer than polymers so that no indentation occurred . The calibration of probes is needed to calcu - late the probe sensitivity , a parameter that converts the cantilever deﬂection signal from mV to nm . Every calibration was carried out loading the reference surface with a maximal cantilever deﬂection of 400 – 500nm . The sensitivity is then obtained by calculating the slope of the contact linear part of the force – distance curves gained . 3 . 2 . 2 . Characterization of PMMA and Fs 36 S 62 coatings Every sample surface was blown with a dry nitrogen ﬂux to remove most of the impurities from the surfaces . PMMA surfaces and hybrid inorganic – organic coatings were analyzed with stan - dard ACT mounted probes ( AppNano , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) , whose spring constants were calculated by the Sader method [ 53 ] , result - ing in a value of 36N / m for PMMA and 63 . 3N / m for Fs 36 S 62 . For PMMA samples , force curves were carried out at three different rates ( 0 . 05 , 1 and 10Hz ) , using the same tip rate for loading and unloading curves . In order to control and minimize the adhesive forcesduetotheformationofawatermeniscusbetweenthetipand the sample surface , AFM indentation tests were carried out with a relativehumidity ≤ 15 % . Justafterthetipapproachincontactmode , the probe was raised in order to avoid any interaction between the probe and the surface that could affect the indentation . To prevent that an indentation experiment could affect the following one , the position of probes was changed after every applied load , including the approach procedures . All the measurements were carried out in at least 20 different areas of the samples , and the results were averaged . 3 . 2 . 3 . Characterization of PDMS elastomers Silicone rubber samples were analyzed using two spher - ical probes , HYDRA 6R100NG ( k = 0 . 757N / m ) and HYDRA 6R200NG ( k = 0 . 035N / m ) probes with a colloidal SiO 2 tip ( tip radius = 2 . 5 – 4 . 5 (cid:3) m ) in a controlled atmosphere with a relative humidity ≤ 15 % . HYDRA 6R200NG probes were silanized in air with PFDTES at 100 ◦ C overnight to reduce the strong adhesive interactions observed between very ﬂexible probes and compliant PDMS samples . To obtain the force – distance curves on these samples , the same procedure used to indent the stiffer samples was applied . 3 . 2 . 4 . Characterization of hyaluronic acid hydrogels All the samples were supported over a glass microscope slide . Since the swelled hydrogel must remain hydrated , all the sam - ples were indented just after the hydration process , keeping a constant relative humidity of 50 % . Colloidal probes ( series HYDRA 6R200NG , k = 0 . 035N / m ) were used to analyze the hydrogel sam - ples and silanized in air with PFDTES at 100 ◦ C overnight to make it hydrophobic . After any AFM indentation , the probe was retracted from the surface and moved off to avoid any interaction with the sample or the water layer on the hydrogel surface before any sub - sequent indentation . 3 . 3 . Dynamic – mechanical measurements Dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) was performed with a DMA / SDTA861e Mettler Toledo dynamic mechanical analyzer . PMMAspecimenswithathicknessof2mm , awidthof14mmanda length of 75mm were mounted in a three - point bending accessory and analyzed at 25 ◦ C with displacement - controlled scans from 1 (cid:3) m to 400 (cid:3) m and oscillation frequency of 0 . 05Hz and 1Hz . As for PDMS samples , 1 . 5mm thick , round specimens with a diameter of 6 . 7mm were tested in shear mode at 25 ◦ C in the linear vis - coelastic range , with dynamic shear displacement - controlledscans from0 . 1 (cid:3) mto100 (cid:3) mandoscillationfrequencyof0 . 05Hz . TheHA hydrogel samples were analyzed by a stress - controlled rotational rheometerRheometricsDynamicStressRheometer200 . Frequency sweep tests were performed in a frequency range of 0 . 01 – 1Hz , Fig . 1 . z - Piezo displacement vs . forward deﬂection curve measured by AFM on a PMMA surface ( the initial values of cantilever deﬂection are negative because the probewasliftedupbeforeindentationtesttopreventanypossibleinteractionwith the surface ) . with 25mm parallel plates at 37 ◦ C , after having checked the linear viscoelastic range in separate experiments . 4 . Results and discussion The elastic modulus was investigated for a variety of different materialsbymeansofAFMnanoscaleindentationtests . Fig . 1shows a typical forward raw curve obtained directly by AFM on a surface of PMMA . Notwithstanding a positive piezo displacement z in the starting part of the loading curve , no variation in cantilever deﬂection is measured by AFM , because the tip is not still in contact with the surface of sample when the piezoelectric system begins to move the probe toward the sample ( non - contact region ) . When the tip reaches the surface , an abrupt change in the deﬂection of cantilever is then observed ( contact part ) . By interpolating the contact part of rawcurvesintheformofverticalpiezodisplacement z asafunction of cantilever deﬂection d , it is possible to determine the zero inden - tation point of the z - piezo z 0 and the elastic modulus of samples E s through the estimation of ı according to the Hertz ( Eq . ( 12 ) ) , Sned - don ( Eq . ( 13 ) ) , DMT ( Eq . ( 14 ) ) and JKR ( Eq . ( 16 ) ) equations . When adhesive interactions are observed , the DMT and JKR models are more suitable than two others , as discussed in Section 2 . In our experiments , reliable force vs . displacement curves were obtained on PMMA surfaces using a probe with a pyramidal tip and a stiff cantilever ( spring constant k = 36N / m ) ( Fig . 2a ) . Fig . 2a shows that the reverse ( unloading ) curve does not overlap with the forward ( loading ) curve . This result is due to PMMA plastic defor - mation during the loading phase and shows that the sample cannot recover completely the deformation at the end of the unloading phase [ 54 ] . As indicated by the presence of a plastic deformation in the loading phase ( Fig . 2a ) , the unloading curves also appeared to be more suitable than the loading ones to determine elastic modu - lus from AFM indentation tests due to the absence of plastic effects , as also conﬁrmed by previous works [ 41 , 55 ] . In order to calculate the elastic modulus , the zero deﬂection d 0 was determined as the ﬁrst point in the non - contact part of force curves and a Poisson’s ratio (cid:2) s of 0 . 35 was assumed for PMMA [ 56 ] . Considering that adhesive forces are negligible for PMMA samples ( as visible in Fig . 2a ) , interpolation of displacement vs . deﬂection curves of PMMA according to the Hertz and Sneddon models was performed by employing the Eqs . ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , respectively . The determination of two unknown parameters was thus allowed by using the Eqs . ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) : the zero indentation position of the piezo z 0 and the Young’s modulus E s . These results made also pos - sible the calculation of the indentation ı according to the Eq . ( 11 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . A maximum indentation ı max of approximately 150nm Fig . 2 . ( a ) Force vs . z - piezo displacement curve in the complete x - range , ( inset ) in the range where the curve was interpolated and ( b ) force vs . indentation curve obtained from unloading phase with superimposed Sneddon model curve in the dataset selected for the ﬁtting performed by employing the Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 13 ) for PMMA samples . and 90nm was found , respectively , considering the forward and reverse curves ( Table 1 ) . Initially , for the determination of E s , a tip radius R of 6nm was used for the Hertz model ( Eq . ( 12 ) ) and a half - opening angle ˛ of 18 ◦ for the Sneddon model ( Eq . ( 13 ) ) , as suggested by the nominal speciﬁcations provided by the AFM probe manufacturer and checked by electron microscopy ( SEM ) . However , the tips were checked by SEM after the AFM indenta - tions and a variation in features and dimensions was found out . The tip radius was changed from 6nm to 340nm and the half - opening angle from 16 ◦ to 24 ◦ ( Fig . S2 ) . The elastic modulus recalculated withtheSneddonmodelandwiththehalf - openingangleaftermea - surements was found more consistent to the reference value . In addition , the values of maximum indentation suggest that the tip penetrates considerably and deeply into the sample during inden - tation , behaving like a sharp indenter ( Table 1 ) . This behavior of the tip can be approximated by the Sneddon model ( conical inden - ter ) better than the Hertz model . Consequently , it is clear the ﬁtting of reverse curves with the Sneddon model is the most appropriate method to assess nanoscale mechanical behavior of PMMA . With the aim of considering viscoelastic effects on AFM inden - tations of PMMA , different tip rates were employed to perform force curves on this sample [ 57 – 60 ] . As shown in the Supple - mentary materials ( Table S1 and Fig . S1 ) , the values of maximum indentations obtained at 1 and 10Hz were lower than at 0 . 05Hz . Furthermore , the corresponding elastic modulus obtained from unloading curves with the Sneddon model are found to be higher by increasing the tip rate . Stiffening of PMMA samples is mainly duetothedistinctivetime - dependentbehaviorofpolymers [ 61 ] , as also conﬁrmed by measurements performed with well - established techniques such as DMA ( Table S1 ) . It is supposed that viscoelas - ticity of crosslinked polymers such as those analyzed below is less evident . By employing softer cantilevers with a spring constant of 0 . 035 and 0 . 757N / m , no corresponding indentations were found on PMMA ( data not shown ) . This indicates that soft cantilevers can - notapplyforceshighenoughtodeformthermoplasticsurfaces , and are too compliant compared to the sample . In contrast , cantilevers with a spring constant of nearly 30 – 40N / m are suitable to per - form nanoscale indentation tests on thermoplastic polymers such as PMMA . Force – distance curves were also measured on PMMA using spherical tips with a tip radius of 2500nm attached to stiff cantileversbutthemaximumvalueofelasticindentationwasquite low ( ∼ 30nm ) , leading to a poor quality of modulus prediction from force curves ( data not shown ) . With regard to Fs 36 S 62 hybrid coatings , Fig . 3a shows that for - ward and reverse curves obtained with a pyramidal tip and a stiff cantilever ( k = 63 . 3N / m ) overlappedverywelleachothers , suggest - ing a pure elastic behavior of this highly crosslinked material . In addition , likely due to the low surface tension ﬂuoropolymer resin present in Fs 36 S 62 coatings , no relevant adhesive interactions were observed between silicon tips and such surfaces ( Fig . 3a ) . Considering the range of indentations obtained for Fs 36 S 62 sur - faces ( Table 1 ) , the tip can be properly approximated to a sharp pyramidal indenter and therefore the prediction of elastic mod - ulus was performed also in this case by employing the Sneddon modelandahalf - openingangleof24 . 2 ◦ , checkedbySEMaftermea - surement session . Data present in literature for organic - inorganic hybrid coatings are in the range of 4 – 8GPa [ 62 , 63 ] , and appear to be rather lower than those shown in the present study . How - ever , it should be noticed that Fs 36 S 62 hybrid coatings have a much higher fraction of inorganic components , thus resulting in higher values of E s . Cantilevers with a spring constant of about 35N / m and pyramidal tips were also used to indent these hybrid surfaces . However , due to very low penetration depths obtained , this type of cantilevers appeared inappropriate for AFM indentation tests on hybrid coatings ( data not shown ) . The effect of cantilever spring constants on indentations mea - surements was also investigated for softer samples . Silicone samples are sufﬁciently soft to be indented with spherical probes which are more conveniently modeled through the various equa - tions . The force vs . displacement curve obtained on a PDMS surface using a spherical tip and a cantilever with k = 0 . 757N / m is shown in Fig . 4a . As a comparison , AFM indentation tests were also carried out on PDMS employing a cantilever with a lower constant spring ( k = 0 . 035N / m ) ( Fig . 5a ) . In the latter case , however , a hydropho - bic silanization of the tip with PFDTES was needed to reduce strong adhesioninteractionsbetweenSiO 2 sphericaltipandPDMSsurface .

( 1 ) and ( 12 ) for Fs 36 S 62 surfaces . In fact , the contact part of curves is signiﬁcantly reduced or even not present , if these adhesion - dominated interactions are predom - inant as observed without the hydrophobic treatment of tips ( Fig . S3 ) . Pristine silicon - based AFM tips are strongly attracted by PDMS surfaces and in case of very soft cantilever , the z - piezo is engaged in the non - contact part of curves with the adhesive phenomena for the majority of its displacement . As suggested by the nearly complete overlapping of the forward and reverse curves in Figs . 4a and 5a , this elastomeric sample exhibits an elastic behavior . Strong adhesion forces are however evident especially in unloading phase . Van der Waals attractive forces , which are smaller than adhesive forces in the unloading phase , were also noticed in loading curves . This ﬁnding suggests that AFM raw data for PDMS sample have to beanalyzedaccordingtheDMT ( Eq . ( 14 ) ) andJKR ( Eq . ( 16 ) ) models . According to the literature , the JKR approach is more valid for compliant materials and cases with high interfacial energies [ 49 ] , while the DMT theory is known to be applicable to stiffer samples and low interfacial energies [ 48 ] . Accordingly , the DMT model was preferentially applied to analyze the force displacement curves on PDMS surfaces . However , the JKR model was tentatively employed to interpolate the unloading curves because attractive interactions appeared to be considerably high relative to the contact forces in thereversecurves . FortheinterpolationofcurvesapplyingtheDMT and JKR models , datasets were selected as that the point where F = 0 was included and the value of R 2 was as high as possible , as discussed in Section 3 . 2 . Table 2 shows that the values of E s cal - culated using the JKR model are systematically higher than those measured by macroscopic dynamic mechanical analysis . This sug - gests that the JKR model tends to overestimate the elastic modulus Fig . 4 .

Considering the force curves measured using a cantilever with k = 0 . 757N / m , the DMT model gives a value of elastic modulus for PDMS in very good agreement with that obtained by macro - scopic mechanical measurements . By employing a probe with a lowerspringconstant ( k = 0 . 035N / m ) , alowelasticindentationwas reached and the estimate of elastic modulus according to the DMT model was slightly higher when compared to the reference value ( Fig . 5b and Table 2 ) . These results suggest that the DMT model is moreappropriatethantheJKRmodeltoanalyzesampleswithmod - ulus similar to that of PDMS by means of AFM indentation tests . In addition , a spring constant of approximately 0 . 757N / m appears to be suitable in this case because a good value of maximum indenta - tioncanbeobtained ( Fig . 4b ) andamoderateadhesionforcerelative to the max applied force can be observed . AFMindentationexperimentswerealsoperformedinaironsur - faces of hyaluronic acid hydrogels crosslinked with divinyl sulfone ( forbrevity , thesehydrogelswillbereferredtoasHA : DVSfromhere on ) . These samples required a very ﬂexible probe to get indented properly . Hydrogels are very soft and wet , therefore the adhesive forces are predominant in this case . Initially , pristine spherical tips were employed . However a sharp adhesion attraction of the tips toward the water layer above the hydrogel surface was noted , due to the high water content in HA : DVS hydrogels . Due to this strong adhesion phenomenon , the tip was not allowed to move to any directions , making the loading and unloading phases unfeasible . A hydrophobic coating was therefore deposited on the probes with two different silanes in order to analyze these samples . DMDCS was ﬁrstly used to silanized spherical tips , but it still led to sev - eral approach and adhesion issues due to the meniscus effect . The probes were ﬁnally silanized with PFDTES , resulting in an effective Fig . 5 .

Fig . 6 shows the force vs . displacement and force vs . indentation curves obtained on a HA : DVS hydrogel samples using a cantilever with a spring constant of 0 . 035N / m . Stiffer cantilevers did not pro - vide any appreciable indentation on HA : DVS hydrogels . As shown in Fig . 6a , the deﬂection and force due to the adhesion are much higher than the applied force and this affects both the loading and unloading curves [ 64 ] . In case of PDMS , the adhesion caused a sud - den change in the deﬂection value , while the curves obtained on the hydrogel are broader and the change induced by adhesion is smoother . As opposed to PDMS , the loading and unloading curves of HA : DVS are not overlapped , suggesting the presence of dissipa - tion phenomena due to the viscoelastic nature of the hydrogel and high water content of these crosslinked hydrogels . These phenom - ena could also explain the difference in the values of E s obtained Fig . 6 . ( a ) Force vs . z - piezo displacement curve measured using a PFDTES silanized probe with a spring constant of 0 . 035N / m and ( b ) force vs . indentation curve obtained from reverse phase in the dataset selected for the ﬁtting performed by employing the Eq . ( 16 ) for a HA : DVS 1 : 5 hydrogel sample . from forward and reverse curves ( Table 2 ) . Interpolation of the for - ward curves according to the DMT and JKR models provide a value of Young’s modulus lower than those obtained for reverse curves . This difference was observed both applying the DMT and JKR mod - els , which provide a comparable estimate of modulus . These values of modulus were compared with values derived from rheological measurements performed in a previous paper [ 52 ] on a hydrogel swelled in water , taking into account that the two analyses were performed at different temperature , i . e . T AFM = 25 ◦ C and T RH = 37 ◦ C The values of E s obtained from AFM indentations tests are higher than the elastic modulus by rheological measurements . This differ - ence may be partially attributed to some source of uncertainty in AFM - based property measurements , such as the actual cantilever spring constant and the AFM tip shape [ 39 , 41 , 65 ] . However it is likely that for these samples a major source of systematic error is thepartiallossofwaterduringtheindentationexperimentscarried out in air that contributed to make the hydrogels stiffer than those completely swelled .

Conclusive remarks This study presents a critical review of existing theoretical models and the development of an adaptable method for the mea - surements of Young’s modulus for a variety of polymeric and hybrid materials in air by means of an AFM instrument . Elastic moduli ranging from 10 1 kPa to 10 1 GPa were estimated and are in good agreement with rheological and mechanical measurements and with literature data , even allowing for the source of uncertainty in calibration of cantilever stiffness and tip probe geometry . This work also shows how the spring constant of cantilevers in AFM indentation should be chosen mainly taking account of the intrin - sic elastic properties of the sample . A careful selection of cantilever spring constant and geometrical features is indeed important to achieve an optimal indentation range of the sample . More precisely , a cantilever with a spring constant of 30 – 40 N / m and 50 – 60 N / m is recommended for samples relatively stiff up to about 3 GPa and 10 – 20 GPa , respectively . In both cases a pyramidal tip is found to be suitable to perform AFM indentations . In case of soft samples with an elastic modulus of a few thousands of kPa , a max indentation depth of 100 nm , which is appropriate and reliable , was measured using cantilevers with a spring constant of 0 . 5 – 1 N / m and a spheri - cal tip . For very soft materials with 1 – 100 kPa of modulus , the spring constant of cantilevers should be approximately 0 . 035 N / m and a spherical tip is suggested . The experiments were typically carried out in air , allowing a faster and easier sample handling and laser setting on the cantilever when compared to tests carried out in a liq - uid environment . Signiﬁcant adhesion phenomena were observed where ﬂexible cantilevers were used , but they were effectively con - trolled carrying out an easy preliminary hydrophobic treatment of tips . The main limitation of measurements performed in air is prob - ably that of hydrogel samples , due to a partial evaporation of the water during the test . In these speciﬁc cases AFM nanoindenta - tion tests can still be used for an approximated estimate of elastic moduli of very soft samples .
