During the formation of a conditioning layer , surface hydrophobic forces increased and the range of characteristic hydrophobic forces diversiﬁed with time , becoming progressively complex in macromolecular composition , which in return triggered irreversible cellular adhesion . AFM visualization of 1 to 8 week drinking water bioﬁlms showed a spatially discontinuous and heterogeneous distribution comprising an extensive network of ﬁlamentous fungi in which bioﬁlm aggregates were embedded . The elastic modulus of 40 - day - old bioﬁlms ranged from 200 to 9000 kPa , and the bioﬁlm deposits with a height 4 0 . 5 m m had an elastic modulus 5 600 kPa , suggesting that the drinking water bioﬁlms were composed of a soft top layer and a basal layer with signiﬁcantly higher elastic modulus values falling in the range of fungal elasticity . Keywords : bioﬁlm ; drinking water ; AFM ; conditioning layer ; elasticity ; bacteria Introduction Bioﬁlms are formed when free - ﬂoating microorgan - isms attach to a surface . As a microorganism - free environment is diﬃcult to achieve , the presence of bioﬁlms is ubiquitous in many domestic and industrial environments where they are undesirable in most cases . The formation of bioﬁlms in an aquatic environment takes place as a result of several consecutive steps including the formation of an initial conditioning layer ( reversible ) , followed by irreversible adhesion of microbial cells to the conditioned surface , excretion of extracellular macromolecules to reinforce bacterial adhesion ( steady state ) , and ﬁnally detachment which releases microorganisms into the bulk ﬂuid ( Richard - son and Steiner 1995 ; Kjelleberg and Givskov 2007 ; Garrett et al . 2008 ) . Most bioﬁlm investigations indexed in the literature are related to mono - species bioﬁlms ( Klausen et al . 2003 ; Rupp et al . 2005 ; Beloin et al . 2008 ) . In contrast to these , all environmental bioﬁlms are poorly studied due to their heterogeneity , including drinking water bioﬁlms , because of their complexity in terms of population , structure and heavy dependency on environmental condition ( ie the geo - graphical location , the temperature , the season , the quality of the water distribution network or the water treatment ) . Indeed , drinking water bioﬁlms are com - posed of a wide variety of microorganisms ( eg bacteria , protozoa and fungi ) and their structure , topography and physico - chemical properties are closely related to the physico - chemical properties of the surface to be colonized ( Oh et al . 2009 ) and to the diﬀerent microbial populations constituting the system ( Bur - mølle et al . 2006 ) . Numerous analytical techniques , both chemical and physical , have been applied to study the steps in bioﬁlm formation , including various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques ( Denkhaus et al . 2007 ) . Among the microscopic techniques , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) has emerged as a powerful tool in the study of bioﬁlms . Furthermore , this technique provides topographic images from the micro - to the nano - scale . Atomic force spectroscopy provides qua - litative and quantitative information on the physico - chemical properties of the sample such as bioﬁlm - substratum interactions ( Beech et al . 2002 ) or the local hydrophobicity ( Dague et al . 2007 ) . In addition , in contrast to bacterial suspensions for which the immobilization of cells to a substratum is necessary to characterize them by AFM , bioﬁlms are already and naturally attached onto a substratum which facilitates AFM analysis . Indeed , immobilization processing in AFM analyses is often the drawback to studying a biological sample in situ ( Gaboriaud and Dufreˆne 2007 ) . While most bioﬁlm studies using AFM are based on contact - mode topographic images to visua - lize the bioﬁlm morphology ( Surman et al . 1996 ; Beech * Corresponding author .

To the authors’ knowledge , most in situ experi - ments were performed only to study bioﬁlm - substra - tum interactions ( Fang et al . 2000 ; Ahimou et al . 2007 ; Oh et al . 2009 ) . However , few studies have been devoted to the characterization of drinking water bioﬁlms . Among the features of these bioﬁlms , the wide diversity in bacterial populations could imply diﬀerent capacities to condition and colonize surfaces than those already observed for classical mono - species bioﬁlms ( Oh et al . 2009 ) . Furthermore , most previous AFM studies are related to mono - species bioﬁlms whereas the major problem encountered in the industry involves multi - species environmental bioﬁlms . Hence , in this study , applications of the AFM technique , such as nano - indentation and chemical force spectroscopy were employed , in order to investigate the physico - chemical properties ( ie elasti - city , hydrophobicity and adhesion forces ) at diﬀerent formation steps and ages of drinking water bioﬁlms . The objective of this study was to investigate environmental bioﬁlm characteristics , ie ( 1 ) to characterize variations or modiﬁcations in the physico - chemical properties of the samples during the formation of an initial conditioning layer in terms of adhesion and hydrophobicity ; ( 2 ) to demonstrate the development of surface morphological features during the bioﬁlm coloni - zation steps from 1 to 8 weeks ; and ( 3 ) to estimate the range of elastic properties of young and older bioﬁlms . Drinking water bioﬁlm samples were prepared on a glass surface under a hydraulic shear stress of 0 . 12 Pa and the drinking water used here was provided by the water distribution network of town of Nancy ( France ) . The formation of a conditioning layer was studied using a modiﬁed AFM tip to characterize the progress of surface modiﬁcation in terms of hydrophobicity over a short period of time . The quantiﬁcation of the lengths of attached macromolecules and the enumeration of attached bacterial cells were performed on the same samples . The surface colonization processes of drinking water bioﬁlms was monitored by air - phase AFM imaging to visualize the details of bioﬁlm structure and morphology . The elastic properties of the bioﬁlms were investigated by performing nano - indentation experiments and interpolating the ap - proaching force – distance curves while the lengths of macromolecules within bioﬁlms were estimated from the analysis of retreating force – distance curves . Finally , to facilitate further AFM studies on bioﬁlms , some short - comings of using AFM to analyze in situ bioﬁlm samples are mentioned . The study illustrated that AFM techniques can provide useful and otherwise unobtainable informa - tion for studying bioﬁlm formation . Materials and methods Bioﬁlm sample preparation Drinking water bioﬁlm samples were formed on glass coupons ( radius ¼ 0 . 9 cm , thickness ¼ 0 . 1 cm ) placed in a rotating disc reactor . The concept of rotating disc reactors is detailed elsewhere ( Schlichting and Gersten 1979 ) . For sample preparation , new glass coupons were used , and prior to mounting on the reactor they were cleaned in Piranha solution ( 1 : 3 mixture of H 2 SO 4 and H 2 O 2 ) for 3 h at room temperature , rinsed with NaOH ( 20 % ) until the pH was stabilized at 7 , then the coupons were extensively rinsed with milli - Q water . The reactor was operated at a rotational speed of 21 rpm , yielding a hydraulic shear stress of 0 . 12 Pa and a shear rate of 120 s 7 1 . The disc was submerged 3 mm from the top in a water reservoir ﬁlled with tap water , and the glass coupons were held in place by vacuum suction generated by a vacuum pump ( A - 1000S , Tokyo Rikakikai Co . Ltd , Tokyo , Japan ) . The disc reactor was submerged in a suﬃciently large cylindrical water reservoir ( radius ¼ 25 cm , depth 30 cm ) to maintain a stable hydraulic condition , and this cylindrical reservoir was placed in a larger water basin ( 80 cm 6 80 cm 6 50 cm ) to maintain a con - stant reservoir water temperature of 21 8 C . The water in the cylindrical reservoir was continuously supplied from a drinking water tap ( inlet located at the bottom and the outlet at the level of free water surface ) at a water residence time of approximately 24 h . The quality of the water was analyzed during the course of experiments ( pH : 8 . 1 ; bacterial cells : * 10 7 l 7 1 ; conductivity : * 500 m S cm 7 1 ; anions : 5 . 10 meq l 7 1 ; cations : 4 . 90 meq l 7 1 ; chlorine concentration : (cid:2) 0 . 03 mg l 7 1 Cl 2 ) . AFM measurements AFM images and force – distance curves were recorded using an MFP3D - BIO instrument ( Asylum Research Technology , Atomic Force F & E GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) . Conical silicon nitride cantilevers were purchased from Veeco ( MLCT - AUNM , Veeco Instru - ments SAS , Dourdan , France ) , and their spring constants , denoted as k , were determined using the thermal calibration method ( Le´vy and Maaloum 2002 ) , providing k values ranging from 10 – 15 pN nm 7 1 . Prior to use in an experiment , the geometry of the tip was systematically controlled using a commer - cial grid for 3 - D visualization ( TGT1 , NT - MTD Company , Moscow , Russia ) and the tip curvature in its extremity was found to lie in the range * 15 to 40 nm . All the experiments were performed in tap water at room temperature ( 21 8 C ) to maintain the physiological conditions of the bioﬁlm . 740 Y . Abe et al . D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C onn ec ti c u t ] a t 06 : 15 09 O c t ob e r 2014 Imaging Images were acquired at a scan rate of 1 Hz and scan size of 80 m m 6 80 m m with a 512 6 512 line / pixel resolution . AFM imaging in air was carried out after drying a bioﬁlm sample by gently blowing with nitrogen gas . Imaging in liquid was performed in tap water at room temperature with a maximal applied force of 200 pN ( see Figure S3 [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . Nano - indentation experiments Force – distance curves representing the deﬂection of the AFM tip relative to the sample surface were used to quantify the vertical force applied to the surface ( see Figure S4a [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . This technique can be used to measure the local elastic properties and the adhesion forces of the sample surface ( see Figure S4b and S4c [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . The force – volume mode allows force – dis - tance curve cartography to be used , and thus visualiza - tion and measurement point by point of the changes in the adhesion forces on the surface sample . Force – volume images were carried out by collect - ing 32 6 32 nano - indentation events , or force – dis - tance curves , at a scan rate of 1 Hz for a scan size of 80 m m 6 80 m m with a trigger point of 400 nm ( see Figure S3 [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . The cantilever spring constants were systematically veriﬁed before use . The elastic modulus of the drinking water bioﬁlms was calculated from analysis of the approach - ing force – distance curves based of the Hertz theory for elastic media ( Hertz 1881 ) , using conical tip geometry as detailed elsewhere ( Touhami et al . 2003a ) . The physical parameters ( contour length , persistence length ) of the bioﬁlm macromolecules were calculated from the retreating force – distance curves using the Free Jointed Chain ( FJC ) and / or the Worm Like Chain ( WLC ) models with a numerical method described elsewhere ( Polyakov et al . 2011 ) . In this study , the majority of the force – distance curves ( 95 to 98 % ) could be processed with the FJC or WLC models . The results obtained with the FJC model are presented and discussed because those represent the majority of the treatable force curves . It was observed that 5 5 % of 1024 force – distance curves constituting each force – volume image could not be entirely processed with FJC or WLC models and this minority of adhesion peaks could probably represent nonspe - ciﬁc interactions . Within the framework of the FJC model , it is assumed that a macromolecule consists of rigid segments connected through ﬂexible joints . The extension z FJC of the macromolecule may then be expressed as a function of the pulling force F as ( Ortiz and Hadziioannou 1999 ; Janshoﬀ et al . 2000 ) : z FJC ¼ (cid:3) L c cot h Fl k k b T (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) k b T Fl k (cid:4) (cid:5) ; ð 1 Þ where T is the absolute temperature , the Kuhn length l k is a direct measure of the chain stiﬀness , L c is the total contour length of the macromolecule and k b is the Boltzmann constant . The number of monomers N in the macromolecule is simply related to L c and l k according to N ¼ L c / l k . Chemical force spectroscopy Gold - coated silicon nitride cantilevers ( NPG - 10 , Vee - co , Santa Barbara , CA ) were chemically modiﬁed with alkanethiols to obtain hydrophobic probes ( Alsteens et al . 2007 ) . A hydrophobic model surface was prepared from a gold - coated glass slice using the same protocol for the cantilever modiﬁcation . Local hydrophobicity measurements were performed in deionized water at a resolution of 32 6 32 curves , at a scan rate of 1 Hz and a scan size of 80 m m 6 80 m m ( see Figure S4 [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . The hydrophobic speciﬁcity of each modiﬁed probe was veriﬁed on the hydrophobic model surface before sample measurements . Epiﬂuorescence microscope enumeration and multi - staining of drinking water bioﬁlm Enumeration of bacterial cells The number of bacteria attached on a glass coupon was counted using a 20 6 objective lens mounted on an inverted optical microscope ( Axiovert200 , Carl Zeiss Light Microscopy , Germany ) . For each sample , a total of 20 ﬁelds of 860 m m 6 680 m m were analyzed , and the average number of attached bacteria was reported . Optical microscope images were analyzed with an automatic MATLAB 1 algorithm as pre - viously described ( Paris et al . 2007 , 2009 ) . Multi - staining with SYBR 1 Green II / Concanavalin A - Texas red ( ConA - Tx Red ) SYBR Green II 1 and Concanavalin A – Texas Red ( Molecular Probes ) were purchased from Invitrogen ( Invitrogen SARL , France ) . ConA - Tx was diluted in a TRIS - maleic buﬀer solution ( pH * 5 . 8 ) . The buﬀer consisted of a mixture of TRIS at 0 . 06 M , maleic acid at 0 . 04 M , MnCl 2 and CaCl 2 at 0 . 001 M Biofouling 741 D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C onn ec ti c u t ] a t 06 : 15 09 O c t ob e r 2014 concentration . One m l of the commercial SYBR 1 Green II solution was diluted in 2 ml of the TRIS - maleic acid buﬀer and deposited on the sample coupons for 20 min . The glass coupon was rinsed with non - pyrogenic sterile water to eliminate excess SYBR 1 Green II , and slightly dried with ﬁlter paper to remove excess water . Then , the bioﬁlm formed on the glass disk was stained with 0 . 5 ml of ConA – Tx ( at 0 . 5 mg ml 7 1 in TRIS - maleic buﬀer ) for 20 min and extensively rinsed with buﬀer solution . The samples were visualized with an inverted optical microscope ( Axiovert200 , Carl Zeiss Light Microscopy , Germany ) . Two separate images were taken at the same place to visualize SYBR 1 Green II and Texas Red ﬂuorescence ( see Figure S1 [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . Multi - staining with SYBR 1 Green II and CalcoFluor White ( CFW ) CalcoFluor White was purchased from Invitrogen ( Invitrogen SARL , France ) . Drinking water bioﬁlms were also stained with SYBR 1 Green II as previously described and stained with CalcoFluor White . CFW is used as whitening agent by the paper industry and selectively binds to cellulose and chitin . CFW ﬂuor - esces when exposed to UV light and represents a very sensitive method for direct microscope examination of fungal elements ( Monheit et al . 1984 ; Harrington and Hageage 2003 ) . Thirty ﬁve mg of CFW were added to 7 ml 7 1 of sterile distilled water at pH 10 . Then , the bioﬁlm formed on the glass disk was stained with 0 . 2 ml of a solution of CFW and rinsed with sterile water to eliminate excess of CFW . The samples were visualized with an inverted optical microscope and two separate images were taken at the same place to visualize SYBR 1 Green II and CFW ﬂuorescence ( see Figure S2 [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . Results and discussion Formation of a conditioning layer Four samples which were exposed to tap water under a shear stress of 0 . 12 Pa for 1 h , 3 h , 6 h , and 24 h respectively were analyzed . First , the progress of surface modiﬁcations caused by the formation of a conditioning layer was assessed in terms of hydro - phobicity probed by the modiﬁed AFM cantilever tip . Modiﬁed tips were ﬁrst tested on a model surface ( gold surface totally covered by alkanethiols ) to ensure their eﬃciency , and these model - surface tests conﬁrmed the presence of a strong hydrophobic adhesion force with the mean value 4 4 – 6 nN ( Figure 1f ) . Tested tips were then used to map the hydrophobicity of a 80 m m 6 80 m m surface of the samples . Figure 1 shows that the hydrophobicity of a clean glass surface ( without exposure to tap water ) gave rise to small hydrophobic adhesion forces with a tight distribution ( F ¼ 0 . 49 nN and s ¼ 0 . 16 nN ) . The results for the 1 - h exposure sample indicated that hydrophobic adhesion forces had increased signiﬁcantly ( F ¼ 1 . 13 nN and s ¼ 0 . 23 nN ) . The hydrophobic forces of exposed surfaces increased with increasing exposure duration from 1 to 24 h as indicated by a gradual shift in mean values . Furthermore , the shape of the hydrophobic adhesion force distribution became broader with exposure duration and reached a bimodal and multi - modal distribution after 6 h and 24 h exposure periods , respectively . The results are in concordance with previous observations that showed the development of a conditioning layer on a hydrophilic glass surface exposed to natural seawater was accompanied by an increase in hydrophobicity ( Schneider 1997 ; Bakker et al . 2003 ; Fang et al . 2004 ) . Marine conditioning layers are known to consist generally of diﬀerent classes of organic macromolecules such as proteins , lipids , humic acids , nucleic acids , polysaccharides and aromatic amino - acids ( Taylor et al . 1997 ; Compere et al . 2001 ) . Although a drinking - water conditioning layer may very well be diﬀerent from that of marine origin , it is plausible to assume that it also consists of various macromolecules , ubiquitous in drinking water ( Batte´ et al . 2003 ) , and the layer should be hetero - geneous and discontinuous over the coupon surface . In order to investigate the possible presence of diﬀerent classes of macromolecules within a condition - ing layer , the contour lengths ( maximal extension length of a polymer chain ) of the macromolecules attached to the glass surface were quantiﬁed by analyzing the retreating force – distance curves collected from the same samples using a standard , non - modiﬁed , AFM cantilever . The retreating force – distance curves were analyzed by the FJC model . The analyses revealed that the number of adhesive events over the sample surface increased with exposure duration ( 5 2 % at 1 - h and 3 - h exposure , 5 . 5 % and 6 . 9 % at 6 - h and 24 - h exposure , respectively ) . Figure 2 shows the molecular characteristics of the macromolecules pre - sent in the initial conditioning layer after 24 - h exposure . Most of the macromolecules were relatively short , between 50 and 500 nm ( Figure 2a ) , and adhesive retreating force – distance curves were char - acterized by the presence of 1 or 2 adhesion peaks as shown in Figure 2b . Peak ﬁtting with the FJC model indicated that most of the macromolecules detected by AFM had a Kuhn length ranging from 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 nm , suggesting that these macromolecules were quite ﬂexible . In general , the peak occurrence frequency decreased steadily with increasing molecular length . 742 Y . Abe et al .

Biofouling 743 D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C onn ec ti c u t ] a t 06 : 15 09 O c t ob e r 2014 This was expected as the adhesion of macromolecules is controlled by convective diﬀusion and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient decreases as a function of molecular size , as described in the Einstein – Stokes equation for diﬀusion of spherical particles under a low Reynolds number ( Son and Hanratty 1969 ; Paris et al . 2009 ) . Therefore , smaller macromolecules have a higher tendency to collide with a surface than larger molecules . The reported studies on the conditioning layer of bioﬁlms in marine environments revealed that the presence of such a layer strongly inﬂuences the adhesion of microorganisms ( Bakker et al . 2003 ; Jain and Bhosle 2009 ) . In terms of the relationship between surface hydrophobicity and microbial adhesion , it has been reported that the surface hydrophobicity plays a signiﬁcant role in bacterial retention onto a surface after successful bacterial attachment , but it does not inﬂuence the eﬃciency of initial attachment to a surface ( Bos et al . 2000 ; Boks et al . 2008 ) . In this study , the number of attached bacteria was enumer - ated with an automatic MATLAB 1 algorithm for each sample ( 1 - h , 3 - h , 6 - h , and 24 - h exposure samples ) . It was found that there were ( 9 . 3 + 3 . 4 ) 6 10 3 , ( 8 . 5 + 3 . 1 ) 6 10 3 , ( 39 + 11 ) 6 10 3 cells cm 7 2 attached to surfaces after 1 h , 3 h , and 6 h exposure time , respectively . The 24 - h exposure time sample contained many bacterial aggregates , prohibiting the precise counting of attached cells . Although the data are limited , no signiﬁcant increase in the number of attached bacteria was observed after the ﬁrst 3 h . This suggests that the most bacterial collisions could result in ineﬃcient attachment . Given that the number of bacteria in the bulk water was assumed constant during the experiment and the apparent doubling time of attached cells in drinking water networks is expected to be 4 20 days ( Block et al . 1993 ) , the kinetics of bacterial adhesion was reversible during 1 - h to 3 - h exposure periods . Increasing numbers of attached bacteria suggests that bacterial desorption should signiﬁcantly decrease between 3 - h and 6 - h exposure periods . The increase in the eﬃcient bacterial collision rate implies that the kinetics of bacterial adhesion became progressively irreversible . Furthermore , the broadening of the hydrophobic adhesion force dis - tribution coincided with the observed increase in the number of attached bacteria at the 6 - h exposure period . It could imply that a conditioning layer capable of facilitating irreversible bacterial adhesion could require a complex composition of diﬀerent classes of macromolecules as evidenced by the broadening of the distribution . Further experiments with other technique would be necessary to conﬁrm these observations . Progress of surface colonization by bioﬁlms The progress of surface colonization by drinking water bioﬁlms was visually monitored at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 weeks after the initial contact was established under a constant hydrodynamic condition ( shear stress of 0 . 12 Pa ) . Images performed in situ by AFM on bioﬁlms in hydrated medium ( see Figure S3 [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) show a structure composed of clusters and aggregates . It was emphasised that it is very diﬃcult to clearly identify on these images the bacterial colonies or isolated bacteria that constitute the bioﬁlm . In addition , the aggregates were fragile and aﬀected by AFM when samples were scanned by the tip . This attests to the viscoelastic properties , the fragility Figure 2 .

Exopolysaccharides are known to be soft materials that contribute to bioﬁlm viscoelasticity and formation ( Cogan and Keener 2004 ; Lahaye et al . 2007 ) . When samples were slightly dehydrated and imaged in air , the resolution was better and it was easier to identify bioﬁlm structure ( Figure 3 ) , although dehy - dration is likely to aﬀect or alter the bioﬁlm structure . This ﬁgure illustrates the evolution of the bioﬁlm at various ages . The development of drinking water bioﬁlms was already recognizable after 1 week , and the images show that bioﬁlms were discontinuous and heterogeneously distributed as previously described ( Paris et al . 2007 ) . These AFM images clearly demonstrate the increase in surface colonization with time . Additionally , ﬁlamentous bacterial structures ( see Figure 3 ) and probably fungal structures ( Supple - mentary Information and Figure S3 ) embedded within the bioﬁlms were depicted from the ﬁrst week . Multi - staining images ( CFW / SYBR 1 Green II ) revealed important ﬁlamentous structures ( 20 – 300 m m long ) , rich in cellulose that did not contain RNA or DNA ( Figure S1a and S1b [ Supplementary material is available via a multimedia link on the online article webpage ] ) . The structures exposed in Figure 3 seemed to become longer , thicker and denser with time until a network was ﬁnally established throughout the entire surface at 8 weeks . Although relatively little is known , the presence of waterborne fungi in drinking water has long been recognized ( Nagy and Olson 1982 ) . Furthermore , a close inspection of images shown in Figure 3 reveals that drinking - water bioﬁlms appear to anchor themselves on top of this microbial network , implying that this fungal structure may assist in reinforcing bioﬁlm adhesion to a substratum surface . Nanomechanical properties of drinking water bioﬁlms The mechanical properties of bioﬁlms play crucial roles in understanding bioﬁlm resistance to external shearing forces ( Ohashi et al . 1999 ; Stoodley et al . 1999 ; Klapper and Dockery 2006 ) , and the elastic moduli of bacterial bioﬁlms have been measured by various methods ( Stoodley et al . 1999 ; Korstgens et al . 2001 ) . Analysis of AFM nano - indentation experiments were used to calculate the local elastic modulus of soft biological materials ( Touhami et al . 2003a ) . In this study , the elastic moduli of 36 and 40 - day - old drinking water bioﬁlms were calculated based on the approaching force – distance curves recorded during indentation experiments . Figure 4 shows the distribu - tions of an elastic modulus of a typical bioﬁlm - covered surface ( Figure 4a ) and a surface containing a large aggregate ( Figure 4b ) . Both types of bioﬁlm - covered surfaces ( with or without an aggregate ) were found on the same 40 - day - old sample . The elastic modulus ranged from 200 kPa to 9000 kPa , and the column at 10 , 000 kPa represents the total frequency of solid substratum elasticity ( 4 10 , 000 kPa ) where no soft material was encountered . There is no distinctive multimodal distribution of the elastic moduli , but some elasticity ranges can be associated with typical classes of microbial communities . For example , several AFM studies reported elastic moduli of 50 – 500 kPa for microalgae ( Francius et al . 2008b ) , 50 – 2000 kPa for common bacteria ( Abu - Lail and Camesano 2002 ; Gaboriaud et al . 2005 ; Francius et al . 2008a , 2008c ) , approximately 600 kPa for yeast spores ( Touhami et al . 2003b ) , and 2000 to 8000 kPa for germinating yeast and fungi ( Touhami et al . 2003a ; Alsteens et al . 2008 ) . It is reported that drinking water bioﬁlms are composed of various materials such as inorganic hard deposits , microorganisms , and polymeric substances ( Batte´ et al . 2003 ) . A complex composition of bioﬁlms was visually demonstrated by AFM images shown in Figure 3 , explaining the observed large variation in elastic modulus . In addition , a bioﬁlm surface with a large aggregate ( Figure 4b ) contained an increased event frequency especially for the large elasticity range ( 4 1200 kPa ) , falling in the range of representative values for fungi . It may imply that the fungal structure is more abundant near a large bioﬁlm aggregate , and its presence may have resulted in a signiﬁcantly decreased percentage of solid substratum coverage ( 62 % and 17 % for surfaces without and with an aggregate , respectively ) . Soft materials possessing a low elastic modulus value ( 5 600 kPa ) occupied a signiﬁcantly elevated proportion of the distribution for both types of bioﬁlm - covered surfaces ( 12 and 20 % for surfaces without and with a large aggregate , respectively ) . Based on the corresponding AFM height images , the surface coverage rates by bioﬁlm deposits ( the propor - tion of analyzed surface containing an object with a height 4 0 . 5 m m ) were calculated for both cases . The surface coverage rates were 14 % and 20 % for a bioﬁlm surface without ( Figure 4a ) and with a large aggregate ( Figure 4b ) , respectively . The agreement between the percentage of low elasticity proportion and that of surface coverage suggests that the observed soft bioﬁlm materials ( elasticity 5 600 kPa ) were associated with the presence of bioﬁlm deposits having a height 4 0 . 5 m m . Several studies investigated the stratiﬁcation of environmental bioﬁlms , and most of these reported the Biofouling 745 D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C onn ec ti c u t ] a t 06 : 15 09 O c t ob e r 2014 Figure 3 .

AFM nanoindentation experiments can only indicate the elastic property of the outermost layer of a bioﬁlm aggregate . Besides , the elastic modulus values between the soft bioﬁlm deposits ( 5 600 kPa ) and the sub - stratum surface ( 4 10 , 000 kPa ) could be interpreted as the range of values corresponding to the bioﬁlm basal structure . It is important to note that diﬀerent components of drinking water bioﬁlms possess diﬀer - ent elastic properties , which refer to their resistance to external shearing forces . Apparently , it is easier to deform soft bioﬁlm materials found in bioﬁlm aggre - gates than the basal structure . Thus , diﬀerent compo - nents of bioﬁlms will resist diﬀerent levels of shearing stresses . Hence , attention must be paid when assigning a range of values to a certain type of bioﬁlm in modeling studies . The selected range of values needs to correspond to the bioﬁlm component of interest . Figure 4c and 4d presents the results of analyzing retreating force – distance curves from the same experi - ments as used for calculating the elastic moduli as shown in Figures 4a and 4b . The curve ﬁtting results indicate a very large contour length distribution for both types of bioﬁlm - covered surfaces . Although the majority had contour lengths of 100 – 500 nm , some long macromolecules were uncoiled to 3000 nm with Kuhn lengths ranging from 0 . 05 to 2 nm , reﬂecting the presence of very long and ﬂexible macromolecules . Unlike the curves obtained from a 24 - h exposure sample ( Figure 2 ) , those of the 40 - day exposure sample contained numerous adhesion peaks ( 3 to 15 adhesion peaks per curve ) as shown in Figure 4e and 4f , indicating that each indentation event encountered a number of macromolecules of diﬀerent sizes . Also , it is important to note that the macromolecules whose length was 5 500 nm were always detected in signiﬁ - cant amounts whatever the exposure period . These short macromolecules could come from the bulk water or partly from microbial activity . The remainder of the longer macromolecules detected from the 40 - day exposure sample were most likely metabolically pro - duced by bioﬁlm microbial communities as extracel - lular biopolymers to reinforce bacterial adhesion to a surface . The comparison between a typical bioﬁlm - covered surface ( Figure 4c ) and a surface containing a large bioﬁlm aggregate ( Figure 4d ) indicates that the latter type contained longer macromolecules at a higher frequency , strongly suggesting the microbial origin of these long macromolecules . Remarks on using AFM in bioﬁlm studies This investigation illustrates the use of diﬀerent AFM applications to study drinking water bioﬁlms at diﬀerent developmental steps and physiological condi - tions and at a micro - to nano - metric scale , which could not be achieved by other techniques . For example , the measurement of elastic modulus of a basal bioﬁlm structure is probably not measurable by other methods as it is too small to perform a deformation test , and it would require a very large force to deform such a rigid structure . Although AFM remains a powerful tool in bioﬁlm studies , several shortcomings have been ob - served with its use to study bioﬁlms during the work . First and foremost , the requirement of a smooth surface as a substratum material prevents observation of the bioﬁlms formed on frequently employed pipe materials in industry ( eg cast iron and stainless steel ) in which surface roughness demonstrated a strong correlation with the bioﬁlm formation rate ( Pedersen 1990 ; Percival and Walker 1999 ) . The AFM used in this study could not image an object with a height 4 5 m m from the substratum surface due to the photodiode size restriction . Detailed images can readily be obtained when analyzed in air while imaging bioﬁlms in situ in a liquid environment was diﬃcult as the AFM cantilever tip scratched soft bioﬁlms , rendering the image highly streaked . In addition , the cantilever became quickly contaminated by bioﬁlm materials while imaging in liquid ; thus , cantilevers needed to be changed frequently . In terms of study size , the AFM analysis frame is restricted at 90 m m 6 90 m m , hence the information obtained is highly localized . As for the application of modiﬁed cantilever tips , it was observed that the quantiﬁcation of a speciﬁc adhesion force ( such as a hydrophobic force ) was not feasible on bioﬁlm aggregates as the extracellular macromolecules readily stuck to the modiﬁed tip , concealing the speciﬁc adhesion force peak in a broad non - speciﬁc adhesion force . Conclusions The study demonstrated that the steps in drinking water bioﬁlm formation can be followed and investi - gated by AFM techniques ( imaging and force spectro - scopy ) and multi - staining ﬂuorescence microscopy . During the formation of an initial conditioning layer , there was an increase in surface hydrophobicity as a function of time . After a 6 - h exposure period to tap water under a shear stress of 0 . 12 Pa , the distribution of hydrodynamic adhesion forces became broader and multimodal , indicating the presence of diﬀerent classes of macromolecules attached on the surface . The length of these macromolecules ranged from 50 to 500 nm . In addition , the broadening of the distribution curve coincided with a signiﬁcant increase in the number of attached bacteria , hence , the modiﬁcation of the surface by a conditioning layer probably composed 748 Y .

D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C onn ec ti c u t ] a t 06 : 15 09 O c t ob e r 2014 of diﬀerent classes of macromolecules could be necessary for further bacterial adhesion . Surface colonization by drinking water bioﬁlms was visually studied by air - phase AFM images which revealed that the bioﬁlms were discontinuous and heterogeneously distributed in space . Filamentous fungal structures were already visible in 1 - week - old bioﬁlms , and these became longer , thicker and denser with time and appeared to reinforce adhesion of the bioﬁlm onto the surface . In terms of the nanomechanical properties of drinking water bioﬁlms , the distribution of elastic moduli for 40 - day - old bioﬁlms ranged from 200 to 9000 kPa , indicating the complex composition of the bioﬁlm materials , as was evident from air - phase AFM images . The bioﬁlm aggregates with a height 4 0 . 5 m m had an elastic modulus 5 600 kPa , suggesting that the drinking water bioﬁlms were composed of a soft top layer and a basal layer with a signiﬁcantly higher elastic modulus values . The length of macromolecules in 40 - day - old bioﬁlms ranged from 100 to 3000 nm , with Kuhn lengths of 0 . 05 to 2 nm , reﬂecting the presence of very long and ﬂexible macromolecules . The comparison between the macromolecule length dis - tributions of 24 - h and 40 - day old surfaces suggested that the macromolecules with a length 4 500 nm were likely to be microbial extracellular biopolymers .
