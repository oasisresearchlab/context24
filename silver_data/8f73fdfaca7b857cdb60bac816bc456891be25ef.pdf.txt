Ge - netic linkage studies and investigations of both spo - radic and familial tumors suggest that NF2 is caused by inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene in chromo - some 22q12 . We have identified a candidate gene for the NF2 tumor suppressor that has suffered nonover - lapping deletions in DNA from two independent NF2 families and alterations in meningiomas from two un - related NF2 patients . The candidate gene encodes a 587 amino acid protein with striking similarity to sev - eral members of a family of proteins proposed to link cytoskeietai components with proteins in the ceil membrane . The NF2 gene may therefore constitute a novel class of tumor suppressor gene . introduction Neurofibromatosis ( NF ) is a term used to describe two major human genetic disorders both of which display au - tosomai dominant inheritance and involve tumors of the nervous system , but are distinct clinical entities ( Mulvihili et al . , 1990 ) . NFl , or von Reckiinghausen NF , is more common ( incidence of 1 in 4000 ) and is characterized by the highly variable expression of an array of features that include neurofibromas , cafe - au - iait macuies , Lisch nod - ules of the iris , and a predisposition to certain malignant tumors ( Riccardi , 1981 ; Riccardi and Eichner , 1986 ) . it is caused by defects in a chromosome 17 gene that has recently been isolated and characterized ( Viskochii et al . , 1990 ; Cawthon et al . , 1990 ; Wallace et al . , 1990 ) . The NF7 gene product , termed neurofibromin , is a large protein with a GTPase - activating protein - related domain and is presumably involved in modulating a signal transduction pathway whose disruption can lead to tumor formation ( Bailester et al . , 1990 ; Buchberg et al . , 1990 ; Xu et al . , 1990 ; DeCiue et al . , 1992 ; Basu et al . , 1992 ) . By contrast , NF2 , which occurs in about 1 of 40 , 000 live births ( Evans et al . , 1992 ) , is characterized by bilateral schwannomas that develop on the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve . Pressure from these tumors often causes hearing loss and vestibular symptoms in the sec - ond and third decade . Other tumors of the brain , especially meningiomas , and schwannomas of other cranial nerves and spinal nerve roots ( Martuza and Eldridge , 1988 ) as well as posterior capsular lens opacities ( Kaiser - Kupfer et al . , 1989 ) are common and are generally present in the young adult . The NF2gene is highly penetrant , and individ - uals with it have a 95 % chance of developing bilateral vestibuiar schwannomas . NF2 is often more severe than NFl , with teenage or early adulthood onset of multiple slow growing tumors that can gradually cause deafness , balance disorder , paralysis , or increasing neurological problems necessitating repeated surgical procedures . NF2 was shown to be genetically distinct from NFl by linkage studies that assigned the NF2 gene to chromo - some 22 ( Rouleau et al . , 1987 ; Wertelecki et al . , 1988 ; Rouleau et al . , 1990 ; Narod et al . , 1992 ) . The tumor types that occur in NF2 are found more frequently in the general population as solitary , sporadic tumors . Since frequent loss of alleles on chromosome 22 from both sporadic ves - tibular schwannomas and meningiomas and from their counterparts in NF2 had been noted previously , the iocai - ization of the inherited defect to the same chromosome region suggested that the NF2 locus encodes a recessive tumor suppressor gene ( Knudson , 1971 ) whose inactiva - tion leads to tumor formation ( Seizinger et al . , 1986 , 1987a , 1987b ) . A number of studies of both sporadically occurring tumors and tumors from NF2 patients have pro - vided consistent support for this hypothesis ( Couturier et al . , 1990 ; Rouieau et al . , 1990 ; Fiedler et al . , 1991 ; Fon - taine et al . , 1991a , 1991b ; Bijlsma et al . , 1992 ; Wolff et al . , 1992 ) . The combined use of family studies and tumor deletion mapping has progressively narrowed the location of NF2 within the q12 band of chromosome 22 , defining a candidate region in which to search for the genetic defect ( Rouieau et al . , 1990 ; Wolff et al . , 1992 ) . Here , we report a gene from the NF2 region that has suffered nonoveriap - Cell 792 1234 kbp - 600 - 230 - 200 Figure I .

This candidate gene encodes a novel protein related to the moesin ( membrane - organizing extension spike Not I 17Okbp 230 Not I protein ) - ezrin ( cytovillin ) - radixin family of cytoskeleton - associated proteins ( Gould et al . , 1989 ; Turunen et al . , 1989 ; Funayama et al . , 1991 ; Lankes and Furthmayr , 1991 ; Sato et al . , 1992 ) . This protein , which we have named merlin ( for moesin - ezrin - radixin - like protein ) , may represent a new class of tumor suppressor whose function is mediated by interactions with the cytoskeleton . Results Scanning the NF2 Candidate Region for Rearrangement The NF2 candidate region on chromosome 22 lies be - tween D22S7 and D22S28 and is estimated to encompass 6 Mb of band q12 ( Frazer et al . , 1992 ) . Since some germ - line NF2 mutations might involve a deletion of the tumor suppressor gene as has been found in Wilms’ tumor and retinoblastoma ( Riccardi et al . , 1978 ; Francke et al . , 1979 ; Dryja et al . , 1986 ) , we set out to scan the candidate region for such alterations . Pulsed - field gel blots containing lymphoblast DNAs from various NF2 patients were probed for several loci in the candidate region , including D22S7 , D22S15 , 022828 , 022532 , 022S42 , 022846 , D22S56 , the leukemia inhibitory factor gene , and the neurofilament heavy chain gene ( NE / % ) . This analysis revealed that in a lymphoblast cell line ( GUS5069 ) derived from a female kbp Not I > 20kbp NEFH 5’ 3’ ml9 7c4 3D ; 1’ - 47All 4D7 - 02AT - 9769 1OHll 24A7 2rJn6 121610 103w - X X X L 4 W t . . . . . . - l - l STS : 96T3 96T7 Probes : B A C . . . . . . . . . * 5’ 3’ Figure 2 .

NF2 patient , a probe for the NEFH locus hybridized to apparently altered fragments of reduced size with both Not1 and Nrul . In Notl - digested DNA ( Figure 1 ) the NEFH probe de - tected fragments of approximately 600 kb , 400 kb , and 230 kb in most lymphoblast cell lines . We were unable to confirm that the 600 kb fragment originates from chromo - some 22 , leaving the possibility that it may derive from hybridization to a related locus ( A . G . M . et al . , unpublished data ) . Variable intensity of the 230 kb fragment in many samples suggested that it resulted from partial digestion of the 400 kb fragment . In GUS5069 , additional fragments of approximately 370 kb and 200 kb were observed , con - sistent with the possibility of a deletion within the region common to the 400 kb and 230 kb fragments . The alter - ation was transmitted along with NF2 from the patient to her affected daughter ( represented by GUS5066 ) ( Fig - ure 1 ) . Chromosome Walking toward the Putative Deletion To isolate DNA corresponding to the region of chromo - some 22 apparently deleted in GUS5069 , a bidirectional cosmid walk was initiated from NEFH . At each step , single restriction fragments of the cosmids were used as probes on pulsed - field gels to establish the location of the putative deletion relative to NEFH . On the 5’side of NEFH , we soon identified a Notl site that was rarely cleaved in lymphoblast DNA . Probes beyond the Notl site detected the same - 400 kb Not1 fragment along with a 170 kb fragment of variable intensity . Thus , infrequent cleavage of this Notl site divides the 400 kb fragment into fragments of 230 kb and 170 kb . Since the putative deletion in GUS5069 affects the 230 kb fragment but not the 170 kb fragment , we con - tinued to walk only 3’of NEFH , again probing pulsed - field gel blots containing DNA from GUS5069 . The Notl pulsed - field gel map , a minimal set of clones representing the cosmid walk , and the extent of the geno - mic deletion ( see Figure 5b ) are shown in Figure 2 . The deletion was reached when we tested a probe ( Figure 2 , probe A ) from cosmid 96ClO that failed to detect the al - tered Notl fragment in GUS5069 . However , various probes from cosmids 28H6 and 121GlO did detect the altered fragment . To estimate the extent of deletion , probes B and C ( Figure 2 ) were tested . Probe B is an 6 kb Hindlll fragment from 26H6 that overlaps with the T3 end of 96ClO . Probe C is a 9 kb Hindlll fragment from the T7 end of 96ClO . Probe B detected both the normal and the altered Notl pulsed - field gel fragments , but probe C de - tected only the normal fragment . For more precise analysis of the deletion , the altered chromosome 22 from GUS5069 was segregated from its normal counterpart in human X hamster somatic cell hy - brids . We created sequence - tagged site ( STS ) assays for the T3 and T7 ends of 96ClO and tested hybrids containing the separated chromosomes 22 . In contrast with the above hybridization results , the T3 end of 96ClO was absent in hybrid GUSH1 34A3 , which contains the deleted chromo - some , but present in GUSH134A10 , which contains the Cell 794 123456789 kb - 9 . 5 - 2 . 4 - 0 . 2 Figure 4 . Northern Blot Analysis of RNA Derived from Human Tumor Cell Lines RNA was size fractionated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde - aga - rose , blotted , and hybridized as described in Experimentaf Procedures . The blot was hybridized with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to bases 1256 - 1942 of the JJR - 1 cDNA .

SW460 colon carcinoma ; lane 9 , EJ bladder carcinoma . normal chromosome . Moreover , the T7 assay was positive in both hybrids . The locations of probes 6 and C and of both STS assays were confirmed on the cosmid walk . Thus , the failure of probe C to detect the altered fragment suggests that the deletion spans most but not all of this sequence . Similarly , the other deletion breakpoint must occur within the region spanned by probe 6 . Therefore , the combination of hybridization and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) results indicates that the deletion must en - compass almost all of 96ClO and up to an additional 5 kb of 26H6 . This 35 - 45 kb region is expanded below the cosmid walk in Figure 2 . Identification and Characterization of the Merlin cDNA Exon amplification ( Buckler et al . , 1991 ) , which produces cloned “trapped exons , ” was applied to cosmids 26H6 , 96C10 , 121GlO , 123F5 , 10Hll , and 7C4 surrounding the site of the NF2 deletion as a rapid method of obtaining exonic probes for cDNA cloning . Each exon clone can represent a single exon or multiple exons spliced together in the trapping procedure . We obtained and sequenced 24 exon clones , 6 of which displayed sequence similarity with the cytoskeieton - associated proteins moesin , ezrin , and radixin ( see below ) . The latter exons were used to screen human frontal cortex and hippocampus cDNA libraries . Figure 3 shows the complete DNA sequence of JJR - 1 , the longest clone obtained in cDNA screening . This se - quence contains eight of the cloned exon segments as shown in Figure 5a . The cDNA is 2256 bp long and shows no evidence of a poiy ( A ) tail . However , two shorter cDNA clones , JJR6 and JJR - 9 , which overlapped the restriction map of JJR - 1 , had apparent poly ( A ) tails beginning at base 2230 . JJR - 1 contains an open reading frame of 1761 bp encoding a predicted protein of 69 kd . There are two in - frame stop codons within 60 bp upstream of the putative initiator methionine . The JJR - 1 cDNA spans at least 50 kb of genomic DNA and is transcribed in the same orientation as NEFH , as shown by the arrows in Figure 2 . Both the JJR - 1 DNA sequence and the predicted protein product were used to search for similarity in nucleic acid and protein data bases using the BLAST network service of the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . The DNA sequence displayed signif - icant similarity to moesin and ezrin genes from several species , including humans ( P = 9 . 0e - 125 and 9 . 0e - I” ) , to mouse radixin ( 1 . le - lo * ) and to Echinococcus multilocu - laris tegument protein ( 2 . 4emZ1 ) . Striking similaritywas also detected at the amino acid level with these same proteins ( 2 . 5e + , 5 . 0e - ‘46 , 2 . 7e - le , and 7 . 6e - 73 , respectively ) and to a potential product of a sequence tag from Caenorhabditis elegans ( 3 . 7e - 43 ) . Weaker similarities were detected to the sequences of two protein - tyrosine phosphatases , PTP - MEG and PTP - Hl ( 1 . 3e - I7 and 9 . 6e - 16 , respectively ) , to erythrocyte protein 4 . 1 ( 9 . 9e - ‘3 and to a wide range of myosin , tropomyosin , and paramyosin proteins . Because this novel gene is most closely related to moesin , ezrin , and radixin ( 450 / o - 47 % identity ) , we have called it merlin . Northern blot analysis using total RNA from various cul - tured human tumor cell lines ( Figure 4 ) revealed two major hybridizing species of 2 . 6 kb and 7 kb , and a less intensely hybridizing RNA of 4 . 4 kb . A similar pattern was detected in poly ( A ) ’ RNA from various human tissues , including heart , brain , lung , skeletal muscle , kidney , pancreas , and liver ( weakly ) , indicating that the merlin gene is expressed widely . The apparent poly ( A ) tails detected in JJR - 6 and JJR - 9 suggest that these clones may have derived from the - 2 . 6 kb RNA . The JJR - 1 clone likely derived from one of the larger RNAs that apparently has a much longer 3’ untranslated region . However , it cannot be excluded that the larger RNAs arise by alternative splicing that alters the length and composition of the coding sequence or by hybridization to related family members . Nonoverlapping Deletions Interrupt the Candidate NF2 Gene To determine whether the deletion detected in GUS5069 interrupts the merlin gene , we prepared exon probes from across the coding sequence ( Figure 5a ) and analyzed Southern blots containing DNA from GUSH134A3 and from GUSH13481 , two independent hybrid lines con - taining the deleted chromosome 22 . The results for probes I and II , shown in Figure 5b , demonstrate that the probe I sequence was absent from both hybrids , while the probe II sequence was present in both . Thus , the genomic deie - tion truncates the merlin gene within the coding sequence between probes I and II , removing the 5’ end . In a search for additional alterations in the merlin gene , we scanned blots of restriction - digested DNA from 33 un - related NF2 patients using the cDNA as probe . One pa - tient , represented by cell line GUS5722 , displayed altered fragments with several restriction enzymes suggestive of a small - 3 - 4 kb genomic deletion . This patient was ana - lyzed in the Southern blots shown in Figure 5c .

IV , and V all reside on the same 21 kb EcoRl fragment . In GUS5722 , probes Ill and V detect both the normal EcoRl fragment and a second fragment reduced in size by the deletion . Probe IV fails to detect the altered fragment in GUS5722 because it lies within the region deleted . We have performed PCR amplification of first strand cDNA from GUS5722 and confirmed the presence of two types of PCR product ( Figure 6A ) . Direct sequencing revealed that the novel PCR product was missing bases 1559 to 1792 of the cDNA , representing deletion of at least two exons . The absence of this segment would remove 76 amino acids from the protein , while leaving the reading frame intact . The GUS5722 cell line was generated from a member of a large NF2 kindred ( family 3 in Narod et al . , 1992 ) and the deletion was present in 5 affected members and absent in 11 unaffected members of this pedigree . The presence of nonoverlapping deletions affecting the merlin gene in two independent families suggests that this gene represents the Nf2 tumor suppressor . We searched for additional alterations by single - strand conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis of PCR - amplified first strand cDNA from tumor and lymphoblast samples . We used mRNA from four primary cultures of meningiomas ( three from NF2 patients with a family history of the disor - der , and one from a probable new mutation to NF2 ) and analyzed only selective regions of the mRNA . Two of the tumors yielded aberrant patterns . A meningioma from a female patient likely to have NF2 ( see Experimental Procedures ) displayed a reduced size for the expected nondenatured PCR product on SSCP gels ( Figure 6B ) . The vastly reduced level of the normal - sized PCR product suggests that this tumor had lost alleles in this region of chromosome 22 . However , lymphocyte DNA was not available from this patient to confirm this . Cell 796 A . 123456 B . 123456 C . 123456 Figure 6 .

All lanes contain a proportion of undenatured product , detected by comparison with lane 1 . Direct sequence analysis of the PCR product confirmed the presence of a 4 bp deletion that removes bases 1781 to 1784 thereby altering the reading frame and generating a shorter protein . A meningioma from a male patient with NF2 displayed an altered pattern on SSCP analysis ( Figure 6C ) . This meningioma was known to have lost heterozygosity on chromosome 22 based on prior comparison of polymor - phic markers in blood and tumor DNA . Thus , the tumor suppressor model would suggest that the normal homolog had been lost and that the remaining copy of the gene represented the altered NF2 allele . Direct sequence analy - sis revealed a single base pair deletion at position 488 ( Figure 3 ) which introduced a frameshift that dramatically alters the predicted protein by introducing a stop codon within 100 bases . Discussion The delineation of nonoverlapping germline deletions af - fecting different portions of the same chromosome 22 gene in two independent NF2 families suggests strongly that the Nf2 tumor suppressor has been found . It is con - ceivable that one or both of these two deletions also affect a second gene in the area . However , for such a gene to supplant our candidate as the Nf2 tumor suppressor , it would have to be affected by both deletions and must therefore be composed of exons interspersed with those of the merlin gene . The larger of the deletions truncates the 5’ end of the merlin gene , removing at least 112 amino acids . In addition , the extent of this deletion suggests that the 5’ regulatory elements may also be missing . The smaller germline deletion removes 78 amino acids from the C - terminal portion of the protein . One would anticipate that such alterations would have drastic consequences for the function of the merlin protein . However , ultimate proof that this locus is NF2 will require reversal of the tumor phenotype by reintroduction of the merlin gene . The 4 bp and single base pair deletions in meningiomas from unrelated NF2 patients could arguably be of somatic origin and unrelated to the inherited predisposition . How - ever , the almost exclusive expression of the altered copy of the merlin gene suggests that the normal sequence has been lost as a somatic event in tumor formation . This is consistent with the tumor suppressor model and would suggest that the frameshift alterations actually represent germline mutations in these patients , further implicating the merlin gene . The merlin protein encoded at the candidate NF2 locus is a novel member of a growing family of proteins that have been proposed to act as links between the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton ( Luna and Hitt , 1992 ; Sato et al . , 1992 ) . All members of the family , which includes moesin , ezrin , radixin , erythrocyte protein 4 . 1 , and talin , contain a homologous domain of - 200 amino acids near the N - ter - minus , followed by a segment that is predicted to be rich in a helixstructure , and a highly charged C - terminal domain . Where they have been characterized from more than one mammalian species , members of this family are remark - ably conserved . Moreover , highly related genes have been detected in the nematode , C . elegans ( Waterston et al . , 1992 ) and in the parasitic cestode , E . multilocularis ( Frosch et al . , 1991 ) . Although most distantly related to merlin , protein 4 . 1 and talin are the best studied members of this family of proteins and have been most revealing concerning their apparent function . Protein 4 . 1 plays acritical role in maintaining mem - brane stability and cell shape in the erythrocyte by con - necting the integral membrane proteins glycophorin and protein 3 ( the anion channel ) to the spectrin - actin lattice of the cytoskeleton ( Leto and Marchesi , 1984 ; Conboy et al . , 1986 ) . Genetic defects in protein 4 . 1 lead to one form of hereditary elliptocytosis ( Tchernia et al . , 1981 ; Delau - nay et al . , 1991 ) . The binding site for glycophorin in protein 4 . 1 has been mapped to the N - terminal domain , sug - gesting that the homologous region in other family mem - NFZ Tumor Suppressor Gene 797 1 100 Hmmn Woesin .

Comparison of Sequence Identities in Merlin - Related Proteins The program PILEUP of the GCG package ( Devereux et al . , 1964 ) was used to generate an optimal alignment of the protein products translated from the following GenSank files : human moesin ( M69066 ) ; mouse radixin ( S66620 ) ; human ezrin ( X51521 ) ; E . multilocularis tegument protein ( M61166 ) ; human erythrocyte protein 4 . 1 ( M14993 ) . Only amino acid identities are shown ; nonidentical residues are indicated by dots , and gaps introduced by the program are represented by empty spaces . bers might also bind to proteins in the membrane ( Let0 et al . , 1988 ) . Interestingly , a related domain is also found in two protein - tyrosine phosphatases , PTP - MEG and PTP - Hl , perhaps allowing these enzymes to associate with the membrane or the cytoskeleton ( Gu et al . , 1991 ; Yang and Tonks , 1991 ) . Binding of protein 4 . 1 tospectrin is mediated by the a - helical region of the protein , suggesting that the analogous segments of the other family members might also bind to cytoskeletal components ( Correas et al . , 1988 ) . Talin , a large protein found in regions of focal adhe - sions at cell - cell or cell - substrate contacts , appears to behave similarly , binding to the integrins in the cell mem - brane and to vinculin , thereby connecting the extracellular adhesion matrix to the cytoskeleton ( Rees et al . , 1990 ; Luna and Hitt , 1992 ) . Moesin , ezrin , and radixin are highly related proteins ( - 70 % - 75 % amino acid identity ) that have each been postulated to provide a link between the cytoskeleton and the cell membrane . Each of these proteins shares 450 / o - 47 % amino acid identity with merlin . Moesin , originally proposed as a receptor for heparan sulfate , has been found at or near the membrane in filopodia and other cell surface protrusions ( Lankes and Furthmayr , 1991 ; Furth - mayr et al . , 1992 ) . Ezrin ( cytovillin ) has been seen in asso - ciation with microvilli and cellular protrusions in many cell types ( Pakkanen , 1988 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ; Turunen et al . , 1989 ; Hanzel et al . , 1991 ; Birgbauer et al . , 1991 ) . Rapid redistribution of ezrin to regions of membrane remodeling , such as microvillar formation and membrane ruffling in response to growth factor stimulation , may be regulated by phosphorylation of the protein on both tyrosine and serine residues ( Bretscher , 1989 ; Krieg and Hunter , 1992 ) . Radixin was isolated from the cell - cell adherens junction , where it is proposed to cap actin filaments and provide for Cdl 798 their attachment to thecell membrane ( Tsukitaet al . , 1989 ; Funayama et al . , 1991 ) . Interestingly , in mitotic cells , ra - dixin is concentrated at the cleavage furrow ( Sato et al . , 1991 ) . Merlin possesses an N - terminal domain that is similar to protein 4 . 1 ( 28 % identity ) and to talin ( 21 % identity ) , but is much more closely related to moesin , ezrin , and radixin ( Figure 7 ) . Amino acid identity between merlin and the three latter proteins is concentrated in the first 342 resi - dues ( - 63 % identity ) . Like these other family members , the merlin protein is predicted to have avery long a - helical domain spanning 160 - 170 amino acids , beginning around residue 300 . The first third of this domain overlaps with the region of strongest homologyto moesin , ezrin , and radixin . The remaining stretch , however , shows limited similarity with these proteins and with a wide variety of myosins and tropomyosins . The C - terminal region of merlin contains a hydrophilic domain analogous to those of the other family members . The similarity in structure of merlin to the other members of this family suggests that it too may normally act as a link between the cytoskeleton and the cell mem - brane and may thus represent a new class of tumor sup - pressor gene . The cytoskeleton of mammalian cells is a complicated latticework of many different kinds of interconnected fila - ments ( Luna and Hitt , 1992 ) . It participates in a wide range of crucial cellular activities , including determining and al - tering shape , movement , cell division , cell - cell communi - cation , cell anchorage , and organization of the intracellu - lar milieu ( Bernal and Stahel , 1985 ) . A defect in a protein that connects some component of this network to the plasma membrane could affect any of these processes and have a consequent effect on growth control . Whether inactivation of the merlin protein disregulates growth by disrupting a signal transduction pathway , by altering an - chorage dependence , by upsetting the cell cycle regula - tion , or by some other mechanism remains to be deter - mined . However , the characteristic structure of the merlin protein suggests that a search for its membrane and cy - toskeletal binding targets might provide a logical route to exploring this question . Experimental Procedures NF2 Cell Lines Lymphoblast cell lines were established ( Anderson and Gusella , 1964 ) from affected members of NF2 pedigrees and from their unaffected relatives . Diagnosis of NF2 conformed to the criteria set forward by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on neurofibromatosis ( Mulvihill et al . , 1990 ) , except for the patient whose meningioma displayed a 4 bp deletion . This patient had a right vestibu - larschwannomaand multiple meningiomas . Although shedid not have a history of NF2 , she probably represents a new mutation . Primary meningioma cells were cultured as described ( Logan et al . , 1990 ) and analyzed after less than five passages . Somatic cell hybrids were prepared by fusing GUS5069 lympho - blasts with a Chinese hamster cell line deficient in hypoxanthine phos - phoribosyltransferase activity ( CHTG49 ; Athwall and McBride , 1977 ) using GIBCO PEG 4000 . Fused cell lines were selected by their ability to grow in media containing hypoxanthine . aminopterin , and thymi - dine . Hybrids were screened for the chromosome 22 homologs using the polymorphic simple sequence repeat marker , TOPIP ( Trofatter et al . , 1992 ) . Control hybrids GM10886 and EyeSFAG ( NA10027 ) are described in the listing of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository collection ( Cornell Institute , Camden NJ ) . DNA / RNA Blotting DNA was prepared from cultured cells , and DNA blots were prepared and hybridizedas described ( Gusellaet al . , 1979 ; Gusellaet al . , 1983 ) . For pulsed - field gel analysis , agarose DNA plug preparation and elec - trophoresis were carried out as described ( Bucan et al . , 1990 ) . RNA was prepared , and Northern blotting was performed as described by Buckler et al . ( 1991 ) . Cosmld Walking The NEFH probe used for blot analysis and to initiate cosmid walking was pJL215 , representing a 4 . 4 kb Kpnl - Xbal genomic fragment con - taining exon 4 and 3’ untranslated region ( Lees et al . , 1988 ) . Cosmid walking was performed in an arrayed cosmid library prepared from DNA of flow - sorted human chromosome 22 ( LL22NC03 ; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ) . Cosmid overlaps were identified ei - ther by hybridization of whole cosmid DNA or isolated fragments to filter replicas of the gridded arrays or by PCR screening of row and column DNA pools . STSs were developed by direct cosmid sequencing using the T3 or T7 end primers ( McClatchey et al . , 1992a ) . cDNA Isolation and Characterization Human frontal cortex and hippocampus cDNA libraries in ZAPII ( Stra - tagene ) were screened using exon probes isolated and prepared as describedbyBuckleretal . ( 1991 ) . cDNAclonesand trappedexonwere sequenced as described ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) . Direct PCR sequencing was performed as described ( McClatchey et al . , 1992b ) . Screening for variations by SSCP analysis followed the procedure described by Ambrose et al . ( 1992 ) . RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo ( dT ) primer ( BRL reverse transcriptase ) to prepare first strand cDNA . Por - tions of the cDNA were amplified using the following primer sets : 5’ ~ CCAGCCAGCTCCCTATGGATG - 3’ and Y - AGCTGAAATGGAAT - ATCTGAAG - 3’ to amplify base pairs 824 - 2100 and 5’ - GCClTCTCC - TCCCTGGCCTG - 3’ and 5’ - GATGGAG’ITCAATTGCGAGATG - 3’ to amplify base pairs 314 - 1207 . These cold PCR products were then reamplified with specific regional primers for SSCP as described in Figure 6 .
