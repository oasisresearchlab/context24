In rme - 4 and rab - 35 mutants , yolk receptors do not accumulate on the plasma membrane as would be expected in an internalization mutant , rather the receptors are lost from cortical endosomes and accumulate in dis - persed small vesicles , suggesting a defect in receptor recycling . Consistent with this , genetic tests indicate the RME - 4 and RAB - 35 function downstream of clathrin , up - stream of RAB - 7 , and act synergistically with recycling regulators RAB - 11 and RME - 1 . We ﬁnd that RME - 4 is a conserved DENN domain protein that binds to RAB - 35 in its GDP - loaded conformation . GFP – RME - 4 also physically interacts with AP - 2 , is enriched on clathrin - coated pits , and requires clathrin but not RAB - 5 for cortical associa - tion . GFP – RAB - 35 localizes to the plasma membrane and early endocytic compartments but is lost from endosomes in rme - 4 mutants . We propose that RME - 4 functions on coated pits and / or vesicles to recruit RAB - 35 , which in turn functions in the endosome to promote receptor recycling .

Internalization of many receptor - ligand complexes from the plasma membrane is clathrin mediated ( Brodsky et al , 2001 ) . Clathrin and cargo molecules are assembled into coated pits on the plasma membrane together with adaptor proteins that link clathrin and transmembrane receptors , concluding in the formation of mature clathrin - coated vesicles . Clathrin - coated vesicles are then actively uncoated and transported to early endosomes . After delivery to early endosomes , sorting oc - curs , determining whether the cargo is degraded or recycled ( Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ) . Transport from early endo - somes to late endosomes , and ultimately to lysosomes , leads to degradation . Cargo to be recycled from early endosomes , such as the transferrin receptor , are sorted into carriers that take them to recycling endosomes , or directly to the plasma membrane . These processes are highly regulated , but the precise molecular mechanisms controlling these steps are not fully understood . Rab GTPases have emerged as critical regulators of intra - cellular transport and have been proposed to deﬁne func - tional domains within the endomembrane system ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Rab function is primarily controlled via nucleotide binding , by which the protein cycles between the active GTP - bound state , in which it physically interacts with effectors on membranes , and the inactive GDP - bound state , where it is thought to be quiescent in the cytoplasm complexed with its chaperone Rab - GDI . The nucleotide cycle is locally controlled by speciﬁc nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) . GTP - bound Rabs associate with speciﬁc membrane compartments and , through their effectors , inﬂuence critical steps in membrane trafﬁc such as vesicle tethering / fusion , vesicle budding , cargo sorting , and membrane - cytoskeleton interaction . These Rab - regulated processes are not acting all at once , but rather are spatially and temporally controlled . In the genomes of higher eukaryotes , Rabs represent the largest group within the Ras superfamily ( Pereira - Leal and Seabra , 2001 ) . The Caenorhabditis elegans genome contains 30 Rabs , whereas the human genome contains over 60 Rab genes . A number of Rab proteins are known to function in the endocytic pathway . For instance , Rab5 is a master regulator of early endocytic events ( Christoforidis et al , 1999 ; McBride et al , 1999 ; Rink et al , 2005 ) . Rab7 functions directly down - stream of Rab5 and is required for transport / maturation from early endosomes to late endosomes ( Bucci et al , 2000 ; Rink et al , 2005 ) . Rab11 regulates endocytic recycling through the recycling endosomes , whereas Rab4 is thought to direct recycling from the early endosomes to the plasma membrane ( van der Sluijs et al , 1992 ; Ullrich et al , 1996 ) . Some Rabs are expressed and function only in the more elaborate context of polarized cell endomembranes , such as those of epithelia and neurons ( Fischer von Mollard et al , 1994 ; Chen et al , 2006 ; Sato et al , 2007 ) . Although a few Rabs have been studied in great detail , the role of many Rabs still remains to be established , along with their regulators and effectors .

We previously described a sensitive in vivo assay for the receptor - mediated endocytosis and trafﬁcking the yolk protein YP170 , a ligand related to the mammalian cholesterol carrier ApoB - 100 ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) . A YP170 – GFP fusion protein , like endogenous YP170 , is synthesized in the intestine and secreted basolaterally into the body cavity from which it is endocytosed by the receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) - 2 yolk receptors expressed in the oocytes , in a clathrin - and adaptor complex AP - 2 - depen - dent manner ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) . This assay has allowed us to isolate a large number of rme mutants showing defects in endocytosis ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ; Grant et al , 2001 ; Zhang et al , 2001 ; Sato et al , 2005 , 2006 ) . Here , we report molecular cloning and functional charac - terization of rme - 4 and rme - 5 , previously uncharacterized complementation groups showing very similar phenotypes . We found that RME - 4 is a DENN domain protein with a proline - rich domain and consensus AP - 2 and clathrin - binding sequences , most similar to the mammalian coated - pit protein Connecdenn ( Allaire et al , 2006 ) . RME - 5 is the worm Rab35 orthologue , a protein recently implicated in the regulation of endocytic recycling in cultured mammalian cells ( Kouranti et al , 2006 ) . We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that RME - 4 functions with RAB - 35 , likely recruiting or acti - vating it on endocytic vesicles . In turn , RAB - 35 accumulates on early endosomes where it is required for the recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane . In the absence of RME - 4 or RME - 5 / RAB - 35 , yolk receptors are lost from the early endocytic pathway and accumulate aberrantly in small cyto - plasmic vesicles , indicating a defect in receptor recycling . These results identify an unexpected connection between coated - pit biogenesis and the downstream recycling of endocytosed cargo . Results rme - 4 and rme - 5 are required for yolk uptake by oocytes We isolated one allele of rme - 4 ( b1001 ) and two alleles of rme - 5 ( b1013 and b1034 ) in our previously described genetic screen for mutants defective in endocytosis of YP170 – GFP ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) . In both rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants , yolk uptake by oocytes was strongly reduced , resulting in high level accumulation of YP170 – GFP in the body cavity ( Rme phenotype ; Figure 1C and E ) . Similar to other endocy - tosis mutants such as rme - 1 and rme - 6 ( Grant et al , 2001 ; Sato et al , 2005 ) , the block in uptake in rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants was not absolute , as some YP170 – GFP could still be detected in mutant oocytes ( Figure 1D and F ) . YP170 – GFP that was taken up localized to vesicles that were fewer and smaller than in wild - type oocytes ( average yolk granule area ; WT , 0 . 915 7 0 . 192 m m 2 ; rme - 4 ( b1001 ) , 0 . 283 7 0 . 086 m m 2 ; rme - 5 ( b1013 ) , 0 . 320 7 0 . 086 m m 2 ) . These results indicate that RME - 4 and RME - 5 are important regulators of receptor - mediated endocytosis in oocytes . Another well - developed assay for endocytosis in C . elegans is based upon the uptake of foreign compounds by scavenger cells called coelomocytes . This is most easily followed in strains in which the muscle cells have been engineered to secrete a signal sequence modiﬁed form of GFP ( ssGFP ) ( Fares and Greenwald , 2001 ) . In wild - type animals , ssGFP is efﬁciently cleared from the body cavity and accumulates in the endosomes and lysosomes of coelomocytes before its degradation ( Figure 1G ) . However , in rme - 4 mutants , an abnormally high level of ssGFP remains in the body cavity , indicating that endocytosis by coelomocytes is impaired ( Figure 1H ) . Some ssGFP was taken up by rme - 4 coelomo - cytes , but the size and morphology of the GFP - positive endocytic compartments were abnormal . On the other hand , rme - 5 mutants showed normal coelomocyte endocyto - sis ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that rme - 4 is generally required for endocytosis in multiple cell types , whereas rme - 5 may be cell type or cargo speciﬁc . RME - 2 is lost from cortical endosomes in rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants Several types of endocytic defects can result in failure to efﬁciently internalize ligands . These include defects in the uptake or transport of cognate receptors to the early endo - some or the failure to recycle such receptors back to the plasma membrane for multiple rounds of uptake . Results of epistasis tests suggested that RME - 4 and RME - 5 function upstream of RAB - 7 ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . To better understand the defect in yolk endocytosis displayed by rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants , we determined the fate of the yolk receptor ( RME - 2 ) in these mutants . We have previously shown , by immunoﬂuorescence and immunoelectron micro - scopy , that at steady state , endogenous RME - 2 yolk receptors are found sparsely distributed on the oocyte plasma mem - brane and are enriched in cortical vesicles and tubules representing early and recycling endosomes ( Figure 2A and G ; Supplementary Figure 2A ) ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ; Sato et al , 2005 ) . Little or no yolk receptor can be detected in the late endosomal yolk granules in wild - type oocytes , indicating efﬁcient sorting of yolk from yolk receptors during endocytic transport . The late endosomal yolk granules are thought to be storage organelles with relatively little degradative capacity , only acquiring high - level proteolytic activity during embryo - genesis , probably via fusion with lysosomes later in development . In rme - 4 or rme - 5 mutant oocytes , the intensity of cortical RME - 2 detected by immunoﬂuorescence was reduced by about twofold ( Figure 2C and D ; Supplementary Figure 2C and D ) . Conversely , the diffuse RME - 2 signal deeper in the cytoplasm was increased in rme - 4 or rme - 5 mutants . The remaining cortical RME - 2 was found in small punctate struc - tures lacking YP170 – GFP , suggesting residence in early endosomal compartments ( Supplementary Figure 2C and D ) . By immunoelectron microscopy , the loss of RME - 2 from cortical endosomal vesicles in rme - 5 mutants was also clear ( Figure 2G – I ) . In the cortex of rme - 5 ( b1013 ) oocytes , we found a twofold reduction in anti - RME - 2 labelling . The vesicles containing RME - 2 appeared smaller and more spar - sely distributed than in wild - type oocytes . In accordance with the immunoﬂuorescence results , we also observed a measur - able increase in anti - RME - 2 labelling of vesicles deeper in the cytoplasm . In mutant oocytes , mislocalized RME - 2 was found in ﬁne vesicles and tubules smaller than 30nm in diameter . There was no increase in plasma membrane RME - 2 labelling , suggesting that uptake of receptors from the plasma membrane was not impaired . These results suggest that , in rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants , sorting and / or recycling of RME - 2 is impaired such that RME - 2 is not maintained in the cortical endosomes . This is different than the phenotype in rme - 6 mutants , where yolk receptors accumulate in small cortical vesicles , failing to fuse with early endosomes Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 1184 ( Sato et al , 2005 ) . This is also different than rme - 1 mutants that are impaired in a late recycling event , leading to yolk receptor accumulation in enlarged cortical vesicles ( W . Liou and B . D . Grant , unpublished data ; Grant et al , 2001 ) . The overall level of RME - 2 protein in rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants as determined by immunoblotting was unchanged , indicating that the altered RME - 2 receptor distribution does not reﬂect a change in receptor synthesis or degradation ( Figure 2J ) . rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutations strongly enhance rab - 11 ( RNAi ) - associated defects As rme - 4 and rme - 5 appeared to be required for sorting / recycling of RME - 2 after endocytosis , we investigated their relationship with RAB - 11 , a well - known regulator of endocy - tic recycling in many eukaryotic species . As we have reported previously , in C . elegans oocytes , RNAi of rab - 11 causes a yolk uptake defect and results in accumulation of RME - 2 yolk receptors in a tubular endosomal compartment in the cortex Figure 1 rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants display endocytosis defects . ( A , C , E ) YP170 – GFP endocytosis by oocytes of adult hermaphrodites . In wild - type , YP170 – GFP is efﬁciently endocytosed by oocytes ( A ) . In the rme - 4 ( b1001 ) and rme - 5 ( b1013 ) mutants , endocytosis of YP170 – GFP by oocytes is greatly reduced and YP170 – GFP accumulation in the body cavity is greatly increased ( C , E ) . Positions of oocytes ( Oo ) and embryos ( Emb ) are indicated . ( B , D , F ) Gonads from wild - type or mutants expressing YP170 – GFP were dissected and ﬁxed before imaging .

Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 1185 and deep in the cytoplasm ( Figure 2B ; Supplementary Figure 2B ) ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) . We measured an overall reduc - tion of cortical RME - 2 under these conditions ( Figure 2B ) . This phenotype is somewhat different from that of rme - 4 or rme - 5 mutants in which non - cortical RME - 2 showed a ﬁne punctate and diffuse staining rather than tubular accumula - tion ( Figure 2C and D ; Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Our results suggested that loss of any of these proteins affects yolk receptor recycling . Using genetics , we asked whether RME - 4 / RME - 5 and RAB - 11 function sequentially in the recycling pathway or in parallel pathways . If RME - 4 / 5 and RAB - 11 function in the same pathway , simultaneous knockdown would be expected to give a phenotype similar to single mutants of either gene . However , when RNAi of rab - 11 was performed in rme - 4 ( b1001 ) or rme - 5 ( b1013 ) mutants , the phenotype was dramatically enhanced . The punctate RME - 2 staining disappeared completely from most cortical areas . The remaining RME - 2 signal accumulated in enlarged Figure 2 RME - 2 is lost from cortical endosomes in rme - 4 and rme - 5 mutants .

( G , H ) Immunoelectron microscopy of RME - 2 was performed in wild - type N2 ( G ) and rme - 5 ( b1013 ) mutants ( H ) . In the cortical area of wild - type oocytes , RME - 2 localizes to the plasma membrane and tubular and vesicular structures ( endosomes ) . In rme - 5 mutants , the RME - 2 signal , and the number of yolk - containing vesicles were signiﬁcantly reduced . Bars , 200nm . ( I ) Quantitative analysis of RME - 2 localization in oocytes . The number of gold particles in the cortical or central regions of oocytes per unit area were counted , and the ratio as compared with wild - type controls is shown ( see Materials and methods ) .

Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 1186 tubular structures ( Figure 2E and F ) . These tubular structures were often observed aggregated in small patches of the oocyte cortex ( Figure 2E 0 and F 0 , arrowheads ) . In some double - mutant animals , the gonad was severely disorganized ( data not shown ) . These strongly enhanced phenotypes resulting from rme - 4 / rme - 5 mutations combined with rab - 11 ( RNAi ) depletion suggest that RME - 4 / 5 and RAB - 11 func - tion in parallel pathways rather than sequentially . We ob - served a similar synthetic effect on RME - 2 localization when another known recycling endosome regulator rme - 1 was depleted in rme - 4 / 5 mutant backgrounds ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . rme - 4 encodes a DENN domain protein We identiﬁed the wild - type rme - 4 gene ( F46F6 . 1 ) by standard methods ( see Materials and methods ) . It encodes an unchar - acterized protein of 661 amino acids containing an N - terminal DENN domain ( Figure 3A ) . The DENN domain occurs in several proteins involved in Rab - mediated processes as well as mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signalling path - ways ( Levivier et al , 2001 ) . The molecular function of the DENN domain remains unclear . Human DENN ( differentially expressed in neoplastic versus normal cells ) is also called MADD ( MAPK activating protein containing death domain ) and functions in signalling pathways that regulate neuronal cell death ( Chow and Lee , 1996 ; Schievella et al , 1997 ; Miyoshi and Takai , 2004 ) . Human DENN / MADD is ortholo - gous to rat Rab3GEP and C . elegans AEX - 3 , guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rab3 / RAB - 3 ( and RAB - 27 in C . elegans ) , GTPases that regulate neurotransmitter release at synapses ( Iwasaki et al , 1997 ; Wada et al , 1997 ; Mahoney et al , 2006 ) . The DENN domain is also found in Rab6ip1 , a protein that physically interacts with Rab6 and Rab11 ( Miserey - Lenkei et al , 2007 ) . In addition to the DENN domain , RME - 4 contains a cluster of SH3 - binding motifs ( PXXP ) in the C - terminal region . This organization of domains within RME - 4 is most similar overall to mouse Connecdenn , a neuronal protein associated with clathrin - coated pits ( Allaire et al , 2006 ) . The rme - 4 ( b1001 ) mutation results in a predicted single amino - acid change ( G257D ) in a highly conserved residue of the RME - 4 DENN domain ( Figure 3B ) . We obtained another allele of rme - 4 , tm1865 , from the Japanese National Bioresource Project for nematodes . This deletion mutant re - moves part of the RME - 4 protein ( at least residues 465 – 529 , Figure 3A ) . rme - 4 ( tm1865 ) mutants display a yolk - endocytosis defect identical to that of rme - 4 ( b1001 ) ( data not shown ) . Using an antibody that we developed against RME - 4 in western blot analysis , we detected a single band of the predicted size for RME - 4 ( 74kDa ; Figure 3C ) . The intensity of the band was greatly reduced after RNAi of rme - 4 , con - ﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the antibody . Consistent with the predicted partial deletion , rme - 4 ( tm1865 ) blots displayed an apparent reduction in molecular weight for the anti - RME - 4 reactive species and strongly reduced band intensity . The missense mutant rme - 4 ( b1001 ) displayed an RME - 4 reactive band of normal mobility but with strongly reduced intensity , suggesting that the integrity of the DENN domain is impor - tant for RME - 4 folding or stability . rme - 5 encodes C . elegans Rab35 We cloned the wild - type rme - 5 gene using standard methods and found that it encodes C . elegans Rab35 ( RAB - 35 ) , a member of the Rab GTPase family recently implicated in recycling from early endosomes ( see Materials and methods ) ( Kouranti et al , 2006 ) . Nonsense mutations were associated with each rme - 5 allele ( b1013 and b1034 ) and are predicted to truncate the protein at amino acid 69 and 64 , respectively ( Figure 3D ) . Both alleles are thus predicted null alleles of rab - 35 . RME - 4 speciﬁcally interacts with the GDP form of RAB - 35 Given the similarity in phenotypes of rme - 4 and rme - 5 / rab - 35 mutants , and the RME - 4 DENN domain that suggests associa - tion with a Rab protein , we hypothesized that RME - 4 and RAB - 35 might function together . As a ﬁrst test of this possi - bility , we examined physical interaction in a yeast two - hybrid assay ( Figure 3E ) . Full length of RME - 4 did not interact with the wild type or a GTPase - defective mutant form ( Q69L ) of RAB - 35 . However , RME - 4 strongly interacted with a mutant form of RAB - 35 predicted to be locked in the GDP - bound conformation ( S24N ) . RME - 4 did not interact with similar GTP - or GDP - locked forms of other endocytic Rab proteins ( RAB - 5 , - 7 , and - 11 ) , indicating the speciﬁcity of the interac - tion . To verify this physical interaction , we also performed co - immunoprecipitation experiments testing the interaction of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in worm lysates . As predicted by the two - hybrid interactions , YFP – RME - 4 co - precipitated with mRFP CherryHA – RAB - 35 ( S24N ) ( Figure 3F ) . Little or no inter - action was observed between YFP – RME - 4 and the wild - type or the Q69L mutant of mRFP CherryHA – RAB - 35 . These results show that RME - 4 preferentially interacts with RAB - 35 ( S24N ) , suggesting that RME - 4 normally interacts with GDP - bound RAB - 35 . RME - 4 regulates the association of RAB - 35 with cortical endosomes To determine the subcellular localization of RAB - 35 in oocytes , we expressed GFP – RAB - 35 using a germline - speciﬁc promoter or its own promoter . GFP – RAB - 35 driven by its own promoter was ubiquitously expressed with a punctate dis - tribution in many cell types ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . We conﬁrmed that expression of GFP – RAB - 35 in the germ line of the rme - 5 ( b1013 ) mutants fully rescued the yolk - uptake defect , indicating that GFP – RAB - 35 is functional and very likely properly localized ( Supplementary Figure 4A and C ) . In oocytes , GFP – RAB - 35 was mainly found on small punctate structures in the cortex ( Figure 4A and B ) . In addition , some GFP – RAB - 35 was also observed on larger vesicles deeper within the cytoplasm ( Figure 4A ) . The latter large vesicles contained high levels of YP170 , indicating that they are yolk granules , which are late endosome - like compartments in these cells ( Figure 4C – C 00 ) . During ovulation , residence of GFP – RAB - 35 on yolk granules became more prominent ( Figure 4A , arrowhead ) . In fertilized embryos , GFP – RAB - 35 was found on yolk granules , smaller vesicles , and on or near the cell surface ( Figure 4F ; Supplementary Figure 3E ) . Human Rab35 ( HsRab35 ) , expressed as a GFP fusion , also rescued yolk endocytosis in rme - 5 ( b1013 ) mutant worms , indicating that the worm and human proteins are true orthologues ( Supplementary Figure 4B and D ) . The subcel - lular localization of GFP – HsRab35 in oocytes was very similar to that of worm RAB - 35 . Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 1187 Rab35 has recently been shown to function in recycling from early endosomes to the plasma membrane in mamma - lian cells ( Kouranti et al , 2006 ) . To determine if the cortical GFP – RAB - 35 signal that we observed corresponds to early endosomes in C . elegans , we tested for colocalization with early endosome marker mRFP Cherry – RAB - 5 in oocytes and early embryos . We observed partial overlap , suggesting re - sidence of RAB - 35 on early endosomes ( Figure 4F – F 00 ; data not shown ) . Colocalization of GFP – RAB - 35 and the early endosome became more evident on the enlarged endosomes present in oocytes expressing low levels of activated mRFP Cherry – RAB - 5 ( Q78L ) ( Figure 4E – E 00 ) . Most often , the RAB - 35 and RAB - 5 signals appeared as partially overlapping puncta , suggesting that the two Rab proteins may segregate into distinct subdomains within the endosome . We also observed occasional GFP – RAB - 35 puncta associated with clathrin - coated pit markers mRFP – clathrin heavy chain - 1 ( CHC - 1 ) or mRFP – a - adaptin ( APT - 4 ) ( Figure 4D – D 00 ; data not shown ) . Our results indicate that most punctate GFP – RAB - 35 signal represents cortical early endosomes , whereas the diffuse cortical GFP – RAB - 35 signal represents the plasma membrane and perhaps occasional clathrin - coated pits .

C . elegans RAB - 35 , RAB - 5 , RAB - 7 , RAB - 11 , and their mutant forms were expressed in the same yeast cells as fusions with the DNA binding domain of LexA ( bait ) . Interaction between bait and prey was tested using LEU2 ( shown ) and b - galactosidase ( not shown ) reporter assays . ( F ) Co - immunoprecipitation of EYFP – RME - 4 and mRFP CherryHA – RAB - 35 or their mutant forms . Total lysates were prepared from worms co - expressing EYFP – RME - 4 and mRFP CherryHA – RAB - 35 or its mutant forms and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - GFP antibody ( upper panel ) or anti - HA antibody ( lower panel ) . Precipitants were probed on immunoblots with anti - HA and anti - GFP antibodies . T ( total lysate ) equals approximately 4 % of the total input into the assay . Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 1188 If RME - 4 regulates RAB - 35 recruitment or activity , then loss of RME - 4 should adversely affect the subcellular locali - zation of RAB - 35 . In rme - 4 mutants , the large cortical GFP – RAB - 35 puncta were lost , although a weaker , fuzzy - appearing GFP – RAB - 35 signal persisted in the cell periphery on or very near the plasma membrane ( Figure 5B and B 0 ) . By contrast , GFP – RAB - 5 ( Figure 5E ) or GFP – CHC - 1 ( data not shown ) labelling of cortical endosomes and pits was not greatly altered in rme - 4 mutants , although the number of GFP – RAB - 5 - positive endosomes were reduced by about one - third . The level of GFP – RAB - 35 protein was normal in rme - 4 mutants as judged by anti - GFP western blot , indicating that RME - 4 affects the localization of RAB - 35 but not its stability ( Figure 5C ) . Taken together , these results suggest that RME - 4 functions as a regulator of RAB - 35 , important for its associa - tion with endosomes . RME - 4 localizes to the clathrin - coated pit and physically interacts with AP - 2 To further understand how RME - 4 regulates the endocytic pathway , we determined its subcellular localization . This was achieved by analysis of a GFP – RME - 4 fusion protein expressed in oocytes that we found rescued the yolk - endo - cytosis defect of rme - 4 mutants , showing that it is functional and therefore is very likely to faithfully represent RME - 4 localization ( Supplementary Figure 4A and C ) . Unlike RAB - 35 , we found that , at steady state , GFP – RME - 4 colocalized well with coated pit markers mRFP – CHC - 1 ( Supplementary Figure 5G – G 00 and H – H 00 ) and mRFP – APT - 4 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that GFP – RME - 4 is mainly found in clathrin - coated pits and / or vesicles . GFP – RME - 4 also colocalized with endogenous CHC - 1 on the oocyte surface , whereas GFP – RME - 4 failed to colocalize with endogenous EEA - 1 , an early endosome marker ( Figure 6C – C 00 and D – D 00 ) . GFP – RME - 4 expressed under the control of its own promoter was broadly expressed with notably high levels in coelomocytes , neurons , pharynx , and intestine ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . In coelomocytes , GFP – RME - 4 localized to puncta on or very close to the plasma membrane . In agreement with our results in oocytes , GFP – RME - 4 in coelomocytes also colocalized with coated - pit marker mRFP – APT - 4 ( Figure 6E – E 00 and F – F 00 ) . Given that RME - 4 localizes to clathrin - coated pits and contains consensus binding sites for coated - pit components CHC - 1 and AP - 2 ( Figure 3A ) ( ter Haar et al , 2000 ; Brett et al , Figure 4 Subcellular localization of rescuing GFP – RAB - 35 in the germ line .

In developing oocytes , GFP – RAB - 35 mainly localizes to small puncta in the cortex .

We found that full - length RME - 4 interacted with the C - terminal ear - domain of APT - 4 in a yeast two - hybrid assay ( Figure 7A ) . N - or C - terminal fragments of RME - 4 , or the mutant form of RME - 4 ( G257D ) , failed to interact with APT - 4 in this assay . We Figure 5 RME - 4 is required for correct subcellular localization of GFP – RAB - 35 in the oocytes .

Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 1190 conﬁrmed the physical interaction in lysates from C . elegans expressing GFP – RME - 4 under its own promoter control . We found that immunoprecipitation of endogenous APT - 4 co - precipitated GFP – RME - 4 ( Figure 7B and C ) . The converse was also true : immunoprecipitation of GFP – RME - 4 co - precipitated endogenous APT - 4 . In contrast , GFP – RME - 4 did not co - immunoprecipitate with EEA - 1 , an early endosome protein , under the same conditions . Collectively , these results indicate that RME - 4 physically interacts with AP - 2 . We further examined whether the cortical localization of GFP – RME - 4 depends on clathrin - coated pit structures . Indeed , we found that RNAi - mediated knockdown of chc - 1 , but not rab - 5 , disrupts the cortical localization of GFP – RME - 4 in oocytes ( Figure 7D ) . Under the conditions used , RNAi of Figure 6 GFP – RME - 4 colocalizes with clathrin in the oocyte cortex .

Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 1191 either chc - 1 or rab - 5 blocked yolk endocytosis and resulted in embryonic lethality , indicating that the RNAi - mediated deple - tions were efﬁcient . Thus , the cortical localization of GFP – RME - 4 depends upon clathrin . We also examined the effect of chc - 1 ( RNAi ) on the subcellular localization of GFP – RAB - 35 ( Figure 7E ) . RNAi - mediated knockdown of chc - 1 impaired accumulation of GFP – RAB - 35 on cortical endosomes , similar to the effect observed in rme - 4 ( b1001 ) mutants , further suggesting that the coated - pit localization of RME - 4 is im - portant for downstream regulation of RAB - 35 . Discussion Here , we genetically identiﬁed C . elegans RME - 4 and RAB - 35 as regulators of endocytic transport and provide in vivo evidence that they function to promote receptor recycling . Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 1192 RME - 4 and RAB - 35 are required for recycling of yolk receptors at early endosomes Our detailed phenotypic analyses indicate that , in rme - 4 and rab - 35 mutants , RME - 2 yolk receptors are internalized from the plasma membrane , but are not efﬁciently retained in cortical endosomes . In the case of rab - 35 , we showed directly that many of the mislocalized receptors are found in small vesicles , approximately 30nm in diameter , suggesting that the receptors are accumulating in transport intermediates . The synthetic phenotype produced by combining loss of rme - 4 or rab - 35 with depletion of rab - 11 or rme - 1 suggests that RME - 4 and RAB - 35 function in a recycling pathway in parallel to that controlled by RAB - 11 and RME - 1 on recycling endosomes . Given our ﬁnding that GFP – RAB - 35 strongly localizes to early endosomes in developing oocytes , our results suggest that RAB - 35 functions in a direct recycling route from early endosomes to the plasma membrane . Consistent with the results from C . elegans null - mutant analysis , Rab35 has also recently shown to associate with early endosomes in mammalian tissue culture cells , and kinetic tests suggested a requirement for Rab35 in rapid recycling of transferrin from early endosomes to the plasma membrane ( Kouranti et al , 2006 ) . Knockdown of Rab35 in HeLa cells causes a defect in the abscission step of cytokinesis ( Kouranti et al , 2006 ) . As C . elegans rab - 35 null mutants are viable and fertile , we conclude that RAB - 35 is not essential for cytokinesis in the nematode . On the other hand , rab - 35 mutants do show a slightly reduced brood size ( N2 , 329 7 30 ; rab - 35 ( b1013 ) , 250 7 12 at 20 1 C ) . In addition , we observed severely disorga - nized oocytes in animals lacking rab - 35 and rab - 11 , suggest - ing a redundant function for these Rabs in oogenesis ( data not shown ) . Cytokinetic events producing individual oocytes from the germline syncytium might be impaired under these conditions . RME - 4 is an upstream regulator of RAB - 35 To date , nothing has been reported on regulators or direct effectors of Rab35 in any species . We genetically identiﬁed rme - 4 and rab - 35 as functionally related genes . The most notable feature of RME - 4 is the DENN domain at its N - terminus . DENN domains appear in several proteins involved in Rab function and are also associated with signalling path - ways ( Levivier et al , 2001 ; Miyoshi and Takai , 2004 ; Miserey - Lenkei et al , 2007 ) . However , the molecular function of the DENN domain has remained elusive . Importantly , this do - main was found in rat Rab3GEP and worm AEX - 3 , guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rab3 / RAB - 3 ( Iwasaki et al , 1997 ; Wada et al , 1997 ; Mahoney et al , 2006 ) . The DENN domain of Rab3GEP is necessary for its biochemical GEF activity ( Miyoshi and Takai , 2004 ) , suggesting that the DENN domain may contribute part of the catalytic function . The preferential interaction of RME - 4 with RAB - 35 ( S24N ) , and the RME - 4 - dependent early endosomal localization of GFP – RAB - 35 , suggests that RME - 4 functions to recruit RAB - 35 to the early endosome , possibly leading to nucleotide exchange and Rab activation . Alternatively , RME - 4 could act to recruit RAB - 35 to membranes where it is activated by other regula - tors . Further investigation will be required to address these possibilities . It is also clear from our studies that RME - 4 has additional functions independent of its regulation of RAB - 35 , as rme - 4 mutants show clear defects in endocytosis by coelomocytes , whereas rab - 35 mutants have no such defect . One likely explanation is that RME - 4 regulates at least one additional Rab GTPase , one that is required in coelomocyte cells . A similar situation has been well documented for AEX - 3 , which acts as a GEF for both RAB - 3 and RAB - 27 and displays mutant phenotypes similar to rab - 3 ; rab - 27 double mutants ( Mahoney et al , 2006 ) . Regulation of RAB - 35 by a clathrin - coated pit component RME - 4 The colocalization of GFP – RME - 4 with clathrin - coated pit markers and its physical interaction with AP - 2 suggest that RME - 4 is a clathrin - coated pit component . RME - 4 is likely to bind directly to AP - 2 , and possibly CHC - 1 , through its con - sensus AP - 2 - and clathrin - binding motifs . It should be noted that RME - 4 also has several SH3 - binding motifs . Many com - ponents of clathrin - coated pits contain SH3 domains , or SH3 - binding motifs , and are known to form complex networks of interacting proteins ( Brett and Traub , 2006 ) . Thus the proline - rich motifs present in RME - 4 could also contribute to coated - pit association . Three human proteins are similar in overall domain structure to RME - 4 ( DENN / MADD - containing pro - tein 1A , 1B , and 1C ) . Recently , mouse Connecdenn , which is an orthologue of human DENN / MADD - containing protein 1A , was shown to localize to clathrin - coated pits in neurons and was shown to interact with endophilin A1 and inter - sectin , SH3 domain proteins involved in synaptic clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Allaire et al , 2006 ) . These results suggest that RME - 4 is a conserved component of clathrin - coated pits , and further suggest potential interaction with additional clathrin - coated pit components . Knockdown of Figure 7 RME - 4 physically interacts with AP - 2 . ( A ) RME - 4 interacts with the C - terminal ear region of APT - 4 in a yeast two - hybrid assay . The ear domain of APT - 4 ( 682 – 925 residues ) was expressed in a yeast reporter strain as a fusion with the DNA - binding domain ( bait ) . Full - length RME - 4 or mutant forms of RME - 4 were expressed in the same yeast cells as fusions with the transcriptional activation domain ( prey ) . Interaction between bait and prey was tested using the LEU2 growth assay . Cell were serially diluted 1 - , 10 - , or 100 - fold and spotted on growth medium . ( B , C ) Co - immunoprecipitation of GFP – RME - 4 and endogenous APT - 4 . Total lysates were prepared from worms expressing GFP – RME - 4 or GFP alone and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - APT - 4 antibody ( B ) or anti - GFP antibody ( C ) . Precipitants were probed on immunoblots with anti - APT - 4 , anti - GFP , and anti - EEA - 1 antibodies . T ( total lysate ) equals approximately 1 . 5 % of the total input into the assay . ( D ) RNAi - mediated knockdown of chc - 1 but not rab - 5 disrupts the cortical localization of GFP – RME - 4 in oocytes . RNAi of chc - 1 or rab - 5 was performed in worms expressing GFP – RME - 4 in the germ line . P 0 worms were grown on RNAi bacteria for 24h at 25 1 C .

Role of RME - 4 and RAB - 35 in endocytosis M Sato et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 8 | 2008 1193 Connecdenn in cultured neurons partially reduced FM4 - 64 uptake by synaptic boutons after chemically stimulated de - polarization ( Allaire et al , 2006 ) . Connecdenn function was not tested in non - neuronal cells , and connecdenn was not tested for effects on recycling that might indirectly affect uptake . We provide evidence that , in C . elegans , RME - 4 primarily functions in receptor recycling rather than receptor uptake per se and thus suggest that a similar situation may exist for RME - 4 homologues in other species such as mam - malian connecdenn . This unexpected connection between coated - pit biogenesis and the downstream recycling of en - docytosed cargo indicated by our work represents a new paradigm that will need to be taken into consideration . We have shown that the coated - pit localization of RME - 4 is disrupted by depletion of CHC - 1 and that the endosomal localization of GFP – RAB - 35 is impaired under these same conditions . This suggests that recruitment of RME - 4 to the coated pit is important for downstream control of RAB - 35 , linking clathrin - coated vesicle formation with subsequent recycling processes . These results suggest that receptor recy - cling is primed during vesicle formation , ensuring that this important downstream event occurs efﬁciently . Our results with RME - 4 and RAB - 35 are highly reminiscent of the pre - viously demonstrated recruitment of exocyst components to the coated pits of Drosophila oocytes , a process that is also not required for yolk receptor internalization but rather is required for the subsequent recycling of yolk receptors ( Sommer et al , 2005 ) . Our results with RME - 4 and RAB - 35 are also reminiscent of our previous results with RME - 6 , a RAB - 5 GEF that is recruited to coated pits and is required to activate RAB - 5 for downstream fusion events ( Sato et al , 2005 ) . Taken together , these studies suggest that formation of clathrin - coated vesicles includes the loading and activation of multiple components not required for uptake per se , but are rather required to prepare the cargo carrier for multiple downstream events , including fusion with early endosomes and rapid recycling of receptors from endosomes back to the plasma membrane . Materials and methods General methods Worm cultures , genetic crosses , and other C . elegans methods were performed according to standard protocols ( Brenner , 1974 ) . Strains expressing transgenes in germline cells were grown at 25 1 C . Other strains were grown at 20 1 C . RNA interference ( RNAi ) was performed by the feeding method ( Kamath and Ahringer , 2003 ) . cDNAs were prepared from EST clone provided by Yuji Kohara ( National Institute of Genetics , Japan ) and subcloned into RNAi vector L4440 ( Kamath and Ahringer , 2003 ) . For RNAi knockdown of rab - 5 , rab - 11 , or chc - 1 , L4 worms were placed onto RNAi plates , and P 0 adults were subsequently scored for phenotype after 24h . For RNAi of rme - 4 , rme - 5 , or rme - 1 , F1 progeny were scored for phenotype . Strains Transgenic strain bIs1 ( vit - 2 : GFP ) , arIs37 ( p myo - 3 : ssGFP ) , pwIs53 ( p pie - 1 : mRFP : chc - 1 ) and pwIs177 ( p unc - 122 : mRFP : apt - 4 ) were described previously ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ; Fares and Greenwald , 2001 ; Sato et al , 2005 ) . A deletion allele of rme - 4 ( tm1865 ) was provided by Shohei Mitani of the Japanese National Bioresource Project for nematodes . rab - 7 ( ok551 ) / mIs1 and unc - 119 ( ed3 ) were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center . Genetic mapping and molecular cloning rme - 4 ( b1001 ) and rme - 5 ( b1013 and b1034 ) were isolated in a screen described previously ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) . The rme - 4 mutation was mapped between unc - 115 and egl - 15 of LGX by classical three - point mapping . To identify a candidate for rme - 4 , we surveyed predicted genes in the C . elegans genomic sequence in this region by RNAi for the Rme phenotype and found that RNAi for one of genes , F46F6 . 1 , caused a strong Rme phenotype . All exons from this gene were ampliﬁed from the rme - 4 ( b1001 ) mutant by PCR and sequenced . Comparison of these sequences with the wild - type gene revealed a single change in the coding region ( G770A ) . To determine the precise coding region of rme - 4 , the apparently full - length cDNA yk629b9 was sequenced . The rme - 5 mutation was mapped between vab - 7 and dpy - 18 on LGIII by three - point mapping . The map position was further reﬁned by complementa - tion test with deﬁciencies ; tDf5 failed to complement rme - 5 but ctDf3 complemented . Similarly , predicted genes in this region were surveyed by RNAi , and the candidate gene of rme - 5 , Y47D3A . 25 / rab - 35 , was identiﬁed . All exons of this gene ampliﬁed from the rme - 5 mutants were sequenced and identiﬁed a single mutation for each allele ( b1013 ; C205T , b1034 ; G191A ) . Expression of F46F6 . 1a or rab - 35 as GFP fusions under the pie - 1 promoter rescued the Rme phenotype of the rme - 4 ( b1001 ) or rme - 5 ( b1013 ) mutants , respec - tively . RNAi of F46F6 . 1 and rab - 35 by the feeding method caused the Rme phenotype only in the F1 and subsequent generations . Plasmids and transgenic strains To express GFP fusions in the germ line , rme - 4 genomic DNA or cDNAs of C . elegans rab - 35 and human Rab35 ( Guthrie cDNA Resource Center ) were cloned into pDONR221 and then transferred into pID3 . 01B ( Pellettieri et al , 2003 ) by Gateway cloning ( Invitro - gen , CA ) . To express RFP mChery – RAB - 5 and RFP mChery – RAB - 5 ( Q78L ) , rab - 5 and its mutant form were cloned into AZ132 _ m - Cherry _ Gtwy ( a gift from A Audhya and K Oegema ) . To express EYFP – RME - 4 in the intestine , the coding region of GFP in p vha - 6 - GFP ( Chen et al , 2006 ) was replaced with that of EYFP and a genomic rme - 4 fragment was cloned downstream of EYFP . To express mRFP CherryHA fusions , the act - 5 promoter ( 2005bp ) and the coding sequence of mRFP CherryHA was subcloned into pPD117 . 01 ( a gift of A Fire ) . A Gateway cassette ( Invitrogen , CA ) and the unc - 119 gene from C . briggsae was further subcloned into the vector . The coding sequence of mRFP Cherry was ampliﬁed from AZ132 _ mCher - ry _ Gtwy by PCR , and a linker fragment coding an HA epitope ( YPYDVPDYA ) was inserted just after the mRFP Cherry coding sequence . cDNA fragments of rab - 35 , and its mutant forms generated by site - directed mutagenesis , were cloned into this destination vector by Gateway cloning . To construct GFP – rme - 4 driven by its own promoter control , the entire genomic rme - 4 fragment including the upstream ( 2369bp ) and downstream ( 2140bp ) regions was cloned into pBluescriptII SK ( þ ) ( Stratagene ) , and then a GFP fragment was inserted in frame into the intrinsic Nde I site at the start codon of the rme - 4 gene ( pBSSK – GFP – rme - 4 ) . As we could not subclone the entire genomic fragment of rab - 35 , a genomic fragment containing the 1st to 3rd exons were subcloned into pDONR221 - rab35 ( cDNA ) , resulting a genomic - cDNA hybrid minigene . This rab - 35 minigene was cloned into p vha - 6 - GFP , and then the genomic fragment upstream of rab - 35 ( 6049bp ) was subcloned upstream of GFP . All integrated transgenic lines were obtained by the microparticle bombardment method ( Praitis et al , 2001 ) . pBSSK – GFP – rme - 4 was cobombarded with plasmid MM016B encoding the wild - type unc - 119 gene into unc - 119 ( ed3 ) mutant worms . A list of transgenic lines constructed for this study is provided in Supplementary data . Immunoblotting and antibodies For immunoblotting of whole worm lysates , lysates were prepared from 50 adults ( 24h after L4 ) by boiling in Laemmli sampling buffer and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit anti - RME - 4 or anti - RME - 2 antibodies or goat anti - GFP antibody . The entire coding sequence of rme - 4 was subcloned into pEXP1 – DEST ( Invitrogen ) . cDNA sequences encoding the hub domain of CHC - 1 ( aa 1176 – 1681 ) were subcloned into the pET15 vector ( Novagen ) . His - tagged RME - 4 and CHC - 1hub were expressed in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed under denaturing conditions and outsourced for injection into rabbits ( Advanced Technology Planner , Japan ) . This RME - 4 antibody worked well on western blots but could not detect RME - 4 in situ after aldehyde or methanol ﬁxation . The CHC - 1 antibody worked well on both western blots and in situ after aldehyde ﬁxation .

Two - hybrid assay The DupLEX - A two - hybrid system ( OriGene Technologies Inc . , MD ) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions . A full - length cDNA of rme - 4 was cloned into pJG4 - 5 . A cDNA fragment corresponding to the C - terminal region of APT - 4 ( aa 682 – 925 ) was cloned into pEG202 . cDNA of rab - 35 lacking the last four residues and its mutant forms ( S24N and Q69L ) were cloned into pEG202 . C . elegans rab - 5 , rab - 7 , rab - 11 , and their mutant forms were also cloned into pEG202 . These plasmids were introduced into a reporter strain EGY48 included with the system . To assess the expression of the LEU2 reporter , transformants were grown on plates lacking leucine , histidine , tryptophan , and uracil , containing 2 % galactose / 1 % rafﬁnose at 30 1 C for 3 days . Immunoprecipitation To detect physical interaction between GFP – RME - 4 and endogenous APT - 4 , a transgenic line expressing GFP – RME - 4 ( pwIs268 ) was used to prepare whole worm lysates . Co - immunoprecipitation experi - ments between GFP – RME - 4 and APT - 4 were performed as described previously ( Sato et al , 2005 ) . To detect physical interaction between RME - 4 and RAB - 35 , transgenic worms strains were constructed expressing EYFP – RME - 4 ( dkIs163 ) and either mRFP CherryHA – RAB - 35 ( dkIs187 ) or with its mutant forms ( dkIs191 or dkIs194 ) . Approximate 0 . 3ml of young adults harbouring the two transgenes were harvested and washed with M9 buffer . They were resuspen - dend in 1ml of 25mM HEPES – KOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 50mM potassium acetate , 5mM magnesium acetate , and 1mM dithiothreitol contain - ing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and protease inhibitors ( Complete EDTA - free , Roche Diagnostics GmbH ; IP buffer ) and homogenized in a stainless steel homogenizer ( Wheaton Science Products , NJ ) . Homogenates were incubated on ice for 30min and cleared twice by centrifuga - tion for 10min at 16000 g at 4 1 C . For immunoprecipitation , extracts were incubated with mouse anti - GFP monoclonal antibody ( 3E6 , Q - BIOgene Inc . , CA ) or mouse anti - HA monoclonal antibody ( 16B12 , Covance Research Products Inc . , CA ) for 2h at 4 1 C followed by incubation with protein G - Sepharose ( Sigma ) for 2h at 4 1 C . Beads were washed with IP buffer three times and IP buffer without Triton X - 100 once . Precipitants were eluted with Laemmli sampling buffer and subjected to immunoblotting using goat anti - GFP polyclonal antibody ( Research Diagnostics Inc . , NJ ) and rat anti - HA mono - clonal antibody ( 3F10 , Roche Diagnostics GmbH ) . Microscopy To observe live worms expressing transgenes , worms were mounted on agarose pads with 10mM levamisol in M9 buffer . In some cases , when two germline - expressed transgenes were crossed together , one or both transgenes became silenced . In such cases , transgene expression was restored before imaging by blocking the silencing mechanism , using rde - 2 feeding RNAi ( Kim et al , 2005 ) . Immuno - staining of dissected gonads were performed as described pre - viously ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) . Confocal images were obtained using an Olympus confocal microscope system FV1000 with (cid:2) 60 , 1 . 35 NA UPlanSApo oil - objective lens ( Olympus Corp . , Japan ) . Quantiﬁcation of images was performed with software included in the FV1000 system . Fluorescence images were obtained using an Axiovert 200M ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc . , Germany ) micro - scope equipped with a digital CCD camera ( C4742 - 95 - 12ER , Hamamatsu Photonics , Japan ) and Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging Corp . , PA ) and then deconvolved with AutoDeblur software ( AutoQuant Imaging Inc . , NY ) . For immunoelectron microscopy , adult N2 and rme - 5 ( b1013 ) were anaesthetized in M9 containing 20mM sodium azide , transferred to a drop of ﬁxative ( 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer ) , and cut immediately at the level of the pharynx . After 2h of ﬁxation at room temperature , animals were embedded in 12 % gelatin . Ultrathin cryosectioning and immuno - gold labelling with anti - RME - 2 INT antibody were performed sequentially as described ( Sato et al , 2005 ) . To quantify the RME - 2 labelling density , sampling was taken from a block that harboured N2 and rme - 5 gonads side by side , so that both could be subject to precisely the same preparation and labelling conditions . Electron micrographs were taken from 11 section pairs from ﬁve different grids . The cortical zone was deﬁned as within 500nm of the cell surface . Gold particle number per unit area was estimated by the point counting method ( Grifﬁths , 1993 ) . Total areas quantiﬁed were 20 m m 2 ( N2 ) and 22 m m 2 ( rme - 5 ) for the central zone and 82 m m 2 ( N2 ) and 127 m m 2 ( rme - 5 ) for the cortical zone , respectively .
