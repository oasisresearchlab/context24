Here we identify a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by an actin regulatory and signaling protein , Abelson Interactor 1 ( ABI1 ) . Using prostate cancer models , we uncover a reciprocal regulation between ABI1 and the Androgen Receptor ( AR ) . ABI1 is a direct , androgen - regulated target ; in turn , ABI1 interacts with AR and its splice variant ARv7 , and co - regulates a subset of specific transcriptional targets . ABI1 directs transcription through transient yet well - defined interaction of its intrinsically disordered region with DNA . Clinical evaluation shows that the ABI1 - DNA binding ( through Exon 4 splicing ) and ABI1 - AR interaction are regulated during androgen deprivation therapy and prostate cancer progression , thus controlling tumor plasticity through connecting actin cytoskeleton and cellular signaling to transcriptional regulation . We propose ABI1 as epigenetic regulator of transcriptional homeostasis in AR - driven cancers . Statement of importance This study describes fundamental discovery in prostate cancer identifying novel mechanism of transcription by unique DNA binding mechanism involving actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein ABI1 . ABI1 - DNA binding activity predicts survival of prostate cancer patients . Moreover , we discover ABI1 - AR reciprocal regulation that has far reaching implications for tumor plasticity and androgen - sensitive pathogenesis . Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 2 Introduction Epigenetics regulates cellular and organismal fate , overlaying the role of genetics in human disease and tumor evolution . This is particularly evident in Androgen Receptor ( AR ) driven cancers , in which targeting transcriptional regulation with androgen pathway inhibitors ( ARPI ) is a mainstay therapy . These treatments lead to the induction of transcriptional reprogramming , plasticity , and re - adaptation , which becomes a major challenge in effectively targeting therapy - resistant cancers such as castrate - resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) [ 1 ] . AR pathway inhibition leads to transcriptionally - induced plasticity . The insult from the ARPI therapy leads to clonal selection of tumor cell population with either reversible or irreversible states , resulting in heterogeneity of prostate tumors . A critical mechanism of prostate cancer ( PCa ) heterogeneity is the deregulation of transcriptional co - activators of AR that contribute to DNA binding specificity [ 2 - 4 ] . Here , we identify a novel regulatory mechanism of AR - mediated transcription by a cytoskeleton - and signaling - regulatory protein , Abelson Interactor 1 ( ABI1 ) . ABI1 is a key component of the WAVE regulatory complex that promotes branched actin polymerization underlying cell motility and cell - cell adhesion [ 5 ] . The WAVE complex delivers signals from cellular receptors to downstream signaling proteins [ 6 ] . ABI1 regulates PI3 kinase as well as nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as ABL and SRC [ 7 , 8 ] , sequestering the latter from activating STAT3 [ 5 ] and thus preventing non - canonical WNT pathway activation . The latter observation underscores ABI1’s tumor suppressor role as a signaling protein in advanced PCa , but no role for ABI1 in transcription or DNA binding has been identified . Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 3 Here , we define ABI1 - AR reciprocal regulation involving two non - exclusive molecular mechanisms of ABI1 - AR and ABI1 - DNA interactions . These interactions are co - regulated during PCa evolution and clinical treatment promoting tumor plasticity and progression . We show that ABI1 binds AR via a multivalent interaction mechanism resulting in the co - liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) of the N - terminal intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of AR and ABI1 as well as the C - terminal SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) folded domain of ABI1 . We also demonstrate that ABI1 binds chromatin through the homeobox homology region ( HHR ) located within the IDR of ABI1 . The HHR binds dsDNA without inducing a disorder - to - order transition , thereby resulting in the formation of a “fuzzy complex” [ 9 ] . The interaction between HHR and DNA is modulated by the splicing states of HHR’s Exon 4 , whose expression is associated with high - grade , advanced - stage PCa tumors and lower survival . Together , our results demonstrate that the ABI1 - AR transcriptional program is altered during tumor progression and by anti - androgen treatments , suggesting that ABI1 is a key plasticity regulator in PCa by coupling its actin regulatory and signaling functions to transcriptional regulation . Our results provide new paths for biomarker and drug design discovery in PCa . Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 4 RESULTS ABI1 is an androgen - regulated AR target modulated by clinical hormonal therapies . Changes in ABI1 expression during the natural progression of PCa [ 5 ] prompted us to evaluate AR - dependence of the ABI1 gene in the clinical PCa samples undergoing androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) ( Fig . 1A - B ) . Immunoexpression analysis indicated that ABI1 is overexpressed in CRPC compared to primary / untreated tumors . Moreover , ABI1 expression is suppressed by Neoadjuvant Hormone Therapy ( NHT ) and in tumors with neuroendocrine PCa ( NEPC ) phenotype ( Fig . 1A ) . Analysis of mRNA expression in PCa tumors from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas and Firehose / PRAD datasets indicated a positive correlation of ABI1 and AR expression ( Fig . 1C - D ) [ 10 , 11 ] . We further confirmed changes in ABI1 expression in PCa PDX models representing hormone - sensitive primary PCa , CRPC , and NEPC ; and confirmed overexpression of ABI1 in CRPC and downregulation in NEPC models ( Fig . 1E - F ) . Similarly , Abi1 expression was also downregulated in the prostatic epithelium of castrated mice ( Fig . 1G - H ) . In summary , analysis of ABI1 levels in PCa tumor and mouse tissue indicates a positive correlation between ABI1 levels and AR activity . It was important to determine whether ABI1 is a bona fide AR - regulated gene as suggested by the expression data . The hormone - sensitive cell line LNCaP showed increased expression of ABI1 upon treatment with synthetic androgen R1881 while treatment with enzalutamide , an AR inhibitor , decreased ABI1 expression ( Fig . 2A - B ) . Investigation of ChIPseq datasets of hormone - dependent cell lines , including LNCaP [ 12 , 13 ] and VCAP [ 13 - 15 ] , revealed the presence of an intronic AR - binding site ( ARBS ) within the ABI1 gene ( Fig . 2C ) and the presence of active methylation marks Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 5 ( H3K4m1 / 3 ) and H3K27ac upstream , indicating active transcription and regulatory regions ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . ChIP - qPCR of the ARBS within the second intron of the ABI1 gene increased AR binding thus confirming regulation of ABI1 expression ( Fig . 2D ) . In the same LNCaP cells overexpressing AR [ 16 ] we showed that increased AR binding at the ARBS within the ABI1 gene correlated with the increased ABI1 gene mRNA expression ( Fig . 2E ) . These data indicate direct transcriptional regulation of ABI1 by AR . We then investigated whether AR stimulation impacts a known function of ABI1 in promoting cell - cell adhesion . Previous studies have shown that ABI1 regulates cell - cell adhesion through E - cadherin localization at cell junctions through downstream WAVE complex formation [ 17 ] . AR stimulation with R1881 in LNCaP cells promoted E - cadherin levels at cell junctions in a hormone sensitive manner ( Fig . 2F , H - I ) . E - cadherin accumulated at 48 - , and 72 - hours post - hormone stimulation in presence but not in absence of ABI1 , indicating that AR - dependent regulation of E - cadherin at cell junctions is mediated by ABI1 ( Fig . 2G , J ) . Collectively , these data indicated that ABI1 regulation of cell - cell adhesion is AR regulated and androgen - dependent . ABI1 interacts with the full - length AR and its splice variant ARv7 in prostate cancer cells and tissues . Since both AR [ 18 ] and ABI1 [ 19 ] can reside in the cytoplasm and the nucleus , we investigated whether these proteins could interact in these subcellular compartments . Protein sequence analysis of AR and ABI1 indicated a potential binding region between the proline rich motifs within the N - terminal Intrinsically Disordered Region ( N - IDR ) of AR and the C - terminal SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of ABI1 ( Fig . 3A ) . Using co - immunoprecipitation , we demonstrated that Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 6 ABI1 - AR interacted across multiple PCa lines ( Fig . 3B - F ) . In 22Rv1 cell lines we observed the interaction of ABI1 not only with the full - length AR , but also with the truncated AR splice variant ARv7 ( Fig . 3E ) , notoriously associated with emergence of CRPC [ 20 ] . By expressing either the full - length AR or ARv7 in the AR - negative cell line PC3 we further confirmed that ABI1 co - immunoprecipitated with both AR forms independently ( Fig . 3F ) which is consistent with the conservation of the PXXP - rich region in the ARv7 mutant ( Fig . 3A ) . To examine whether the ABI1 - AR interaction is SH3 domain - dependent , we performed experiments re - expressing ABI1 in the genetically modified LNCaP cells where the endogenous ABI1 expression was disrupted by CRISPR and replaced with recombinant ABI1 . This allowed us to probe ABI1 variants with mutations in SH3 or lacking SH3 ; here , we used the specific isoform 2 of ABI1 ( ABI1 Iso2 ) , which is one of the dominant Abi1 isoforms expressed in prostate tissue [ 21 ] . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments in recombinant LNCaP lines expressing ABI1 Iso 2 variants showed that the interaction between AR and ABI1 was partially abolished for an ABI1 Iso2 - W485N mutant , lacking a critical residue within the SH3 domain [ 22 ] ) , or completely abolished in the mutant lacking the SH3 domain ( ABI1 - Iso2 - ∆SH3 ) ( Fig . 3G - H ) . These observations indicated that the interaction between AR and ABI1 is dependent on the SH3 domain . ABI1 interacts with AR through a phase separation mechanism . To understand the biochemical nature of ABI1 - AR protein interactions we investigated a LLPS state [ 23 ] between these two proteins in vitro . AR was shown to form transcriptionally active biomolecular condensates , and while C - terminal folded DNA - and Ligand - binding domains of AR contribute to LLPS formation , the PXXP - containing N - IDR plays the predominant role [ 24 , 25 ] . Using computational biology analyses , we Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 7 found that ABI1 is predominantly disordered with only one structured SH3 domain at the C - terminus and an helical region shown to bind WAVE at the N - terminus [ 26 ] ( Supplementary Figure S2A - B [ 27 ] ) . Interestingly , the N - IDR of ABI1 also contains multiple PXXP motifs , suggesting that both proteins may compete for the same ABI1 - SH3 domain . Using recombinant proteins , we established conditions under which the N - terminus of AR can phase separate individually as demonstrated [ 28 ] or together with the full - length ABI1 ( Supplementary Figures , S3 - 4 ) . This supports the hypothesis that multivalent interactions between AR and ABI1 can mediate the assembly of LLPS droplets in vitro and potentially form condensates in cells consistent with the proposed mechanisms [ 29 ] . To visualize the ABI1 - AR interaction in prostate cancer cells we used proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) using AR , ARv7 , and ABI1 - specific antibodies . We observed the positive signal of ABI1 - AR complexes in the nuclei of LNCaP cells treated with R1881 ( Fig . 3I ) , and ABI1 - ARv7 in 22Rv1 cells ( Fig , 3I ) . Importantly , we also observed the positive PLA signal in clinical specimens of primary PCa , NHT , and CRPC tumors for ARV7 - ABI1 complexes ( Fig . 3J ) . These observations are consistent with ABI1 interacting with activated AR , or its constitutively active ARv7 . To validate the ABI1 - AR interaction using biochemical assays we performed subcellular fractionation followed by co - immunoprecipitation using LNCaP or 22Rv1 cells and confirmed the presence of ABI1 - AR complexes in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments ( Fig . 3E , K , L ) . Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 8 ABI1 binds chromatin and is a transcriptional co - regulator of AR . Having established that AR and ABI1 complexes can phase separate and generate potentially transcriptionally active condensates in the nucleus of PCa ( Fig . 3I - J ) , we investigated the nuclear functions of ABI1 in co - regulating AR - transcriptional activity . We first observed that the nuclear fraction of AR is decreased in ABI1 - KO cells and rescued in cells expressing the wild - type ABI1 Iso2 , but not in the ABI1 SH3 domain mutant , Iso2 - W485N that cannot bind to AR ( Fig . 4 A - B ) , suggesting that the presence of nuclear ABI1 is important for nuclear AR localization . We also observed that loss of ABI1 in LNCaP cells reduced several canonical AR - target gene expressions such as KLK3 , FKBP5 and AR , but did not affect TMPRSS2 , another known AR target ( Fig . 4C ) . Disruption of ABI1 also significantly reduced the expression of the WASF1 gene encoding for a canonical WAVE complex component . Expressing ABI1 - Iso2 recovered WASF1 expression but the two SH3 domain mutants did not ( Fig . 4C ) . Importantly , KLK3 , FKBP5 and AR gene expression was enhanced in ABI1 - Iso2 expressing cells . These results indicated that ABI1 contributes to AR transcriptional activity , and that its SH3 domain may be involved either through its interaction with AR , and / or its impact on AR nuclear localization . Given the effect of ABI1 - Iso2 on the transcription of specific target AR genes we performed ChIP - seq to assess the ability of ABI1 to bind chromatin . ABI1 ChIP - seq in the ABI1 - Iso2 LNCaP cells mapped binding predominantly to promoter regions ( Fig . 4D ) . To determine the potential collaboration of ABI1 - AR in transcriptional activity , we also examined whether the AR DNA binding profile could be modulated by ABI1 . Data from the AR ChIP - seq profile of the same cells displayed AR chromatin binding sites in proximity of genes that had ABI1 bound at promoter sites ( Fig . 4E - F ) . Most Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 9 importantly AR ChIP - seq profiles in ABI1 - KO and ABI1 - Iso2 rescued LNCaP cells showed that the disruption of ABI1 resulted in reprogramming of ~ 20 % of AR chromatin binding . The loss of ABI1 resulted in chromatin occupancy alteration for AR in proximity of a subset of genes coding for cell adhesion proteins , chromatin remodeling complexes , Forkhead family of proteins , and other transcription factors ( Fig . 4G ) . Motif sequence analysis using HOMER identified top ABI1 binding DNA sequences including the homeobox gene binding motif ( Fig . 4H ) . These data demonstrated that ABI1 can bind specific DNA in vivo i . e . , in cells . RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) data from ABI1 - KO and ABI1 - Iso2 LNCaP cells indicated several pathways that were either positively or negatively regulated by ABI1 in response to androgen treatment ( Fig 4I ) . These pathways include JAK / STAT , FOXO , and cell adhesion . Integration of ABI1 ChIP - seq data with RNA - seq data revealed correlations of chromatin binding with modulation of gene expression coding for multiple ABI1 associated complexes ( CRK , CYFIP2 , STAT3 / 5A ) , known EMT regulators ( SMAD6 , SMARCA4 , SOX13 , FZD1 / 8 ) , microtubules ( MAP9 ) , transcriptional initiation complex / chromatin remodeling complexes ( MED31 , CHD4 / 9 ) , and AR - ABI1 dually regulated genes ( FKBP4 , L3MBTL2 , MED31 , NCOR2 , NCOA2 / 3 / 7 , GLI3 , PARP1 / 8 ) ( Fig 4J ) . Overall , these results indicate that ABI1 binds to chromatin , and it is a transcriptional co - regulator of AR . Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 10 ABI1 binds DNA through a binding mechanism involving the HHR region . ChIP - seq data indicated the potential for direct binding of ABI1 to DNA . Moreover , the analysis of ABI1 - dependent expression profiles revealed the regulation of several homeobox transcriptional factors by ABI1 including HOXB4 [ 5 ] that has a weak homology to the ABI1 homeobox homology region or HHR ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Apparently , ABI1 - HHR includes a 5 amino acid region encoded by alternatively spliced Exon 4 . To determine the DNA - binding mechanism of ABI1 we designed several double stranded ( ds ) DNA probes derived from the CHIP and ABI1 expression analysis ; representative dsDNA probes are listed in Supplementary Material , Table 1 . We also used the ABI1 - HHR lacking Exon 4 sequence ( ABI1 - HHR - DelEx4 ) . An in vitro binding assay with dsDNA probes indicated binding affinities in the low micromolar range for dsDNA probes BATF3 , EP300 - AS1 , MIR1289 - 1 , C1orf106 , L3MBTL2 and HOXB4 . ( Fig . 5A - B ) . The recombinant ABI1 - HHR polypeptide spanning amino acid residues 93 - 170 of ABI1 retained similar DNA binding affinity as determined for the full - length ABI1 . Assay results using DNA mutants demonstrated lower affinities for the 2 - residue - mismatched dsDNA HOXB4 probe , and for the ABI1 HHR lacking Exon 4 ( ABI1 - HHR - DelEx4 ) ( Fig . 5C ) . As the DNA mismatch introduces both sequence and shape changes into dsDNA , these data indicated the binding specificity of ABI1 - HHR to HOXB4 , as well as the critical importance of Exon 4 sequence . Analysis of ABI1 mRNA expression during PCa progression revealed differential splicing of the ABI1 gene involving ABI1 - HHR , with Exon 4 expression associated with high grade and stage of PCa tumors and lower survival . Exon 8 and Exon 10 did not show this association ( Fig 5D - F ) . Therefore , we can conclude that ABI1 transcripts containing Exon 4 that carry DNA binding property associated with poor prognosis are selected during PCa progression . Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 11 NMR revealed the molecular determinants for the affinity between DNA and ABI1 - HHR . Because deleting Exon 4 seemed to reduce the affinity of ABI1 - HHR for HOXB4 and this deletion plays a key role in PCa progression , we used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) to identify the molecular determinants for this behavior . NMR reports on changes in the chemical environment of nuclei during binding events making it an ideal tool to probe the interaction with disordered proteins such as ABI1 . ABI1 - HHR was titrated with HOXB4 , and chemical shift perturbation ( CSP ) analysis revealed five distinct regions ( i - v ) of ABI1 - HHR involved in DNA binding ( Fig . 5K ) . The amide signals of the bound form do not display increased dispersion even when approaching saturation , suggesting that the protein does not fold upon binding ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) in contrast to many interactions involving IDRs [ 30 ] . Instead , the ABI - HHR : DNA interaction appears to occur through a “fuzzy complex” [ 31 ] , whereby multiple weak , but specific interactions lead to DNA recognition . Most notably , residues in the deleted region representing Exon 4 do not interact with DNA ( Fig . 5K ) and cannot account for a change in affinity upon deletion . To identify the molecular determinants for the change of affinity of ABI1 towards HOXB4 upon deletion of the five residues 155 - 159 of Exon 4 , we titrated ABI1 - HHR - DelEx4 with HOXB4 and observed smaller changes in chemical shifts when compared to ABI1 - HHR - WT , reflecting a weaker affinity for DNA ( Fig . 5I - J , K ) , in agreement with Fig . 5C . However , residues in region v and residue 139 in region iv displayed markedly smaller CSPs , indicating that they no longer interact with DNA ( Fig . G - H , K ) . To gain insights on the molecular mechanism for this change in affinity , we compared the NMR spectra of apo states of ABI1 - HHR and ABI1 - HHR - DelEx4 . CSP analysis revealed Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 12 that this deletion not only affects the molecular environment of residues at the deletion site but also alters the molecular environments of residues in binding regions v and iv ( Fig . 5L ) . Because residues 155 - 159 of the deleted region do not interact with HOXB4 in ABI1 - HHR , we conclude with confidence that the deletion affects binding through an allosteric mechanism , wherein changes in conformational fluctuations alter residues in regions iv and v such that they can no longer interact with HOXB4 . DISCUSSION Here , we identify a novel genomic function of ABI1 in regulating transcription . ABI1 binds DNA using a combination of weak , yet well - defined interactions . We also demonstrate that ABI1 localizes to the nucleus with AR and modifies its transcriptional activity . Parallel changes of ABI1 and AR during PCa progression and treatment indicate that these proteins co - function together in tumor cells . ABI1 levels intimately regulate prostate tissue phenotype , hence , we propose that the ABI1 and AR axis represents a novel mechanism of tumor plasticity in PCa . ABI1 recognizes DNA through an unusual mechanism that is increasingly reported for disordered proteins , notably for transcription regulation . Protein - nucleic acids interactions have traditionally been thought to be mediated by direct , static contacts between specific protein residues and specific sites on the nucleic acid bases and / or phosphate backbone . While IDRs may undergo disorder - to - order transition when interacting with their binding partners ( i . e . , fold upon binding ) , some IDRs with tight binding affinities remain mostly flexible even in their bound states [ 32 , 33 ] . ABI1 operates through such a mechanism as evidenced by our NMR studies . As pointed Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 13 out by Fuxreiter et al [ 9 ] transient , dynamic interactions within the nucleic acid binding interface , as well as flexible regions outside the binding interface can significantly modulate the sequence specificity and / or binding affinity via the formation of fuzzy complexes rather than the adoption of well - defined static structures in the bound state . These fuzzy complexes result in a dynamic DNA readout mechanism , where multiple distinct regions contribute to the conformational ensemble of the complex and the flexibility required to mediate binding . Such disordered motifs are crucially important for transcriptional regulation via protein : protein and protein : nucleic acid interactions , as well as post - translational modifications and / or alternative splicing [ 34 ] . ABI1 is involved in all these processes as discussed above , ABI1 PTMS have been reported [ 7 , 8 ] , and hence adopts such a disordered scaffold and binding strategy . As observed for many protein complexes involving IDRs , this lack of stability enhances binding by reducing the loss of conformational entropy upon binding . ABI1 recognizes multiple DNA sequences , and such a binding mechanism may provide versatile target recognition while ensuring functional affinities . Hence , ABI1 may provide fine tuning to transcriptional regulation depending on its binding partner . The DNA sequence sites we have identified will provide a basis to alter binding between ABI1 and its partners , whether through mutagenesis or drug design . Direct DNA binding of ABI1 indicates that ABI1 may function as a transcriptional factor alone or in collaboration with another transcription factor , such as demonstrated here for AR . ABI1 binds AR in the nucleus and modifies its transcriptional activity , as reflected by changes in AR - regulated gene expression and chromatin occupancy . ABI1 regulates chromatin remodeling proteins and several transcription factor families such as zinc finger binding proteins , homeobox protein , and forkhead proteins , some Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 14 of which have been implicated in PCa , KLF5 [ 35 ] , or in multiple cancers such as FoxP2 / 3 [ 36 ] . PLK2 is negatively regulated by ABI1 which suppresses EMT , while it promotes MLKL a key regulator of necroptosis [ 37 ] that has been implicated in tumor progression and drug response in PCa [ 38 ] . Notably , ABI1 regulates transcription of cell - adhesion genes thus suggesting a positive feedback mechanism for its role in actin cytoskeleton and cell motility . ABI1 and AR transcriptional axis drives a specific gene expression program that can lead to phenotypic changes during PCa progression . Critically , AR acts on ABI1 gene to control the phenotype of prostate epithelium in an androgen dependent manner . AR promotes cell - cell adhesion homeostasis through ABI1 , which can be dysregulated after significant changes in AR expression . High levels of AR / ABI1 in CRPC and low in NEPC suggests a phenotypic switch during PCa progression from AR - dependent to AR low / negative state . Moreover , ABI1 is also sensitive to clinical treatments targeting the AR pathway as indicated in by results from NHT samples . Hence , AR - ABI1 axis represents novel mechanism of tumor plasticity in PCa . Binding data indicate that the critical region responsible for ABI1 - DNA binding encompasses the homeobox homologous region termed HHR , residues 93 - 170 of ABI1 . Evolutionary analysis indicates that this region is unique to the ABI protein family in worms , flies , bony fishes , vertebrates , and does not have predictable structural features characteristic of homeobox family proteins ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Our clinical data indicates the important role of ABI1 Exon 4 , coding for residues 155 - 159 , as its expression is selected in high - grade and advanced stage PCa ; critically Exon 4 expression is associated with poor survival . We show that deletion of Exon 4 dramatically reduces ABI’s affinity for DNA . NMR spectroscopy analysis indicates that , Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 15 while not directly contacting DNA , the five residues of Exon 4 affect DNA binding via an allosteric mechanism . In conclusion , we identified the novel function of ABI1 in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation . ABI1 connects transcriptional activity to cell signaling and actin cytoskeleton , thus exerting cellular and phenotypic plasticity of PCa . Considering widespread expression of ABI1 in many tissues , AR might be just one example of a transcription factor co - regulated by ABI1 .

Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 18 MATERIALS AND METHODS Generating ABI1 CRISPR KO and rescue cell lines . The target sequence identification for designing gRNA was performed using the online software crispr . mit . edu . The gRNA sequence CTAGAGGAGGAGATCCCGTC ( TGG ) in exon 1 of ABI1 was cloned into a pCas - Guide - EF1a - GFP vector ( cat . # : GE100018 ) from Origene Technologies ( Rockville , MD ) . PC3 and LNCaP cells were transfected with the CRISPR plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Then , the cells were trypsinized and sorted via fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) to obtain GFP - positive cells using a Becton Dickinson FACS Aria III Cell Sorter . Clonal selection of single GFP - positive cells yielded several surviving clones , which were screened for ABI1 protein levels via western blotting , followed by sequence verification by sequencing with ABI1 Exon1 specific primers as described [ 39 ] . ABI1 Isoform 2 , Isoform 2 ( W485N ) , Isoform 2 ( ∆SH3 domain ) , and Isoform 3 constructs were cloned into a pMSCV puro backbone ( Addgene ) and packaged into retrovirus using Phoenix - AMPHO producer cells ( ATCC ) . LNCaP ABI1 KO clone 1 . 5 or PC3 ABI1 KO clone 1 . 1 . 1 cells were transduced for two rounds with the retrovirus produced , and the resistant pool was selected with puromycin for use as “rescue” cell lines . Transient transfection of ABI1 KO cells were performed using the TransIT® - 2020 ( cat . # : MIR 5450 ) transfection reagent according to manufacturer protocol . Transfection incubation period ranged from 48 - 72h to obtain maximum plasmid incorporation into cells . Cell lines and cell treatments . Authenticated LNCaP , PC3 , 22Rv1 ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) , and LAPC4 cell line ( obtained from Dr . Martin Gleave ) were maintained in standard RPMI culture media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( HyClone ) and the appropriate components and rescue cell lines were supplemented with . 25ug / mL puromycin . VCaP cell line ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) were maintained in standard DMEM culture media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( HyClone ) and the appropriate components . LAPC - 4 plates were coated with 5ug / mL poly - L - lysine to help promote adherence to the plate . Cells were Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 19 maintained in standard phenol - free RPMI 10 % charcoal - stripped serum for 3 - 4 days followed by the addition of Vehicle control ( DMSO , androgen deprived media * ADM ) , 1nM R1881 ( Sigma , R0908 ) or 5 μM Enzalutamide ( MDV 3100 , Selleck Chemicals , S1250 ) for 5 , 16 , 24 , 48 , and 72h . Treatments for live cell assays were performed in CSS unless otherwise noted . DNA cloning and constructs . We used the recombinant ABI1 isoform 2 ( ABI1 - Iso2 ) [ 21 ] [ 5 ] for all rescue experiments . To generate SH3 domain mutation , we performed site - directed mutagenesis using Q5 site - directed mutagenesis kit ( New England Biolabs Inc . ) in the pMSCV - Abi1 Isoform 2 DNA plasmid and point mutated tryptophan at amino acid 485 in the SH3 domain to glutamine . The forward sequence was 5’ - GAATGATGATGGCAATTATGAAGGAGTCTGC - 3’ and reverse sequence 5’ - GCAGACTCCTTCATAATTGCCATCATCATTC - 3’ synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) . To produce the ABI1 Isoform 2 deleted SH3 domain we performed Q5 site - directed mutagenesis ( New England Biolabs Inc . ) with forward primer 5’ - TAGCTCGAGGTTAACGAATTC - 3’ and reverse primer 5’ - TTTCTCAATATAATTCTTGGGG - 3’ synthesized by IDT and then verified the sequence ( Genewiz ) . We used the same method to make AR N terminal deletion with forward primer 5’ - CCACCCCAGAAGACCTGC - 3’ and reverse primer 5’ - CCCTAACTGCACTTCTCCAG - 3’ synthesized by IDT .

The protein - protein interaction was investigated using a commercially available PLA kit ( Duolink ; Sigma - Aldrich ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , cells were stained with a pair of primary antibodies at 4 °C for overnight and then labeled with probes linked with complementary DNA ( cDNA ) at 37 °C for 1 hour . cDNAs were ligated at 37 °C for 40 minutes and the product was amplified at 37 °C for 100 minutes . The signal was inspected using the Olympus FV3000RS confocal microscope with a 60x UPLAPO oil objective ( Olympus Canada Inc . , Richmond Hill , Ontario , Canada ; Manufactured by Olympus in Tokyo , Japan . ) . The images were taken using the Z - stack model with the confocal pinhole set to “automatic” with the FC31S - SW software . For presentation purpose , images were exported as bitmap ( BMP ) files [ 41 ] . Recombinant Protein Expression . All His - SUMO - AR and ABI1 constructs were transformed and expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) codon plus E . coli cells using standard molecular biology techniques . Briefly , plasmid transformations were performed by incubating cells on ice for ~ 30 minutes , followed by heat shock at 42 o C for 30 seconds and subsequent icing for 1 minute . LB broth media was added to cells to allow recovery at 37 o C with shaking for 1 hour . Cells were spread / grown on LB - agar plates supplemented with the selection antibiotics chloramphenicol ( CP ) and kanamycin ( kan ) , and then were incubated overnight at 37 o C . The following morning , colonies from the plates were picked and used to inoculate a 5 ml LB media containing CP / Kan and grown at 37 o C for 8 hours with shaking . Cells cultures were then scaled up to a 250 mL flask containing 50 mL LB media with CP / kan and 0 . 5 % glucose , and then allowed to grow overnight at 37 o C with shaking . The following day , 10 - 20 mL of the overnight cell culture was then transferred into 2 . 8 L fernbach flasks containing 1 L of LB media supplemented appropriate antibiotics ( CP / Kan ) and allowed to grow at 37 o C until an OD 600 nm between 0 . 6 . - 1 . 0 was reached . Then , protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG and Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 24 grown overnight at 16 o C with shaking .

Protein Purification . Cell pellets were thawed and sonicated with pulsing of 2 secs on and 4 secs off for 5 minutes to lyse the cells , followed by centrifugation to remove any insoluble cell debris . Supernatant , which contains the protein of interest , was then added to a column containing Nickel - NTA beads , pre - equilibrated with NiA - Guad buffer . To allow the His - SUMO - tagged protein of interest to bind , the Ni 2 + column was incubated at 4 o C for 45 minutes with gentle agitation . After incubation , unbound protein was then collected in the flow - through fraction and stored for later purification . For subsequent Ni 2 + column protein purification of bound protein , the column was washed 3 times with ~ 30 mL of NiA - Guad buffer and then 3 times with NiA - Arg - Gly buffer ( 300 mM NaCl , 200 mM Arg - HCl , 10 % Glycerol , 50 mM Na 2 PO 4 , 5 mM betamercapto - ethanol , 20 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 5 ) . Protein was eluted off Ni 2 + column beads using NiB - Guad buffer ( i . e . NiA - Guad supplemented with 500 mM Imidazole ) in 8 elution fractions of ~ 10 mLs each . SDS - PAGE gel electrophoresis was used to identify the fractions containing the protein of interest and their purity . We then combined elution fractions that had the most abundant and pure protein , concentrated them and then load them them on size - exclusion 26 / 60 gel filtration column ( Cytiva ) for further purification in NiA - Guad buffer . Again SDS - PAGE gel were used to identify fractions containing pure protein , which were then combined , and then concentrated to around 7 - 10mg / ml using centrifugation at 4 o C . Some of the proteins of interest were labelled with Alexa Fluor ™ 488 C 5 Maleimide ( Thermofisher ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions .

Perform the fluorescence polarization reading using Spectra Max Ò i3 plate reader from Molecular Device . Set excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 535 nm . Extract raw fluorescence intensity and calculate the fluorescence polarization ( FP ) using following equation : FP = ( F parallel - F perpendicular ) / ( F parallel + F perpendicular ) , where F parallel = fluorescence intensity parallel to the excitation plane , and F perpendicular = fluorescence intensity perpendicular to the excitation plane . Calculate ΔFP from titrated wells to buffer + 1 μL Alexa dsDNA well by subtracting FP baseline from FP titrated wells .

Unambiguous assignment of ABI1 - HHR and ABI1 - HHR - DelEx4 was achieved by conducting triple resonance experiments with a 240 μM 15 N , 13 C doubly labeled sample of ABI1 - HHR ( 93 - 170 ) . Eight 3D experiments : 3D HNCO ( 4 scans , 1024 ( 1 H , 10 . 58 ppm at 4 . 696 ppm ) x 64 ( 15 N , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) x 75 ( 13 C , 7 ppm at 173 . 1 ppm ) complex points , 2 h 47 min ) , 3D HN ( CA ) CO ( 16 scans , 1024 ( 1 H , 10 . 58 ppm at 4 . 696 ppm ) x 64 ( 15 N , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) x 75 ( 13 C , 7 ppm at 173 . 1 ppm ) complex points , 11 h 14 min ) , 3D CBCA ( CO ) NH ( 16 scans , 1024 ( 1 H , 10 . 58 ppm at 4 . 696 ppm ) x 36 ( 15 N , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) x 58 ( 13 C , 58 ppm at 41 ppm ) complex points , 4 h 54 min ) , 3D HNCA ( 8 scans , 1024 ( 1 H , 10 . 58 ppm at 4 . 696 ppm ) x ( 15 N , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) x ( 13 C , 24 . 4 ppm at 49 . 75 ppm ) complex points , 7 h 16 min ) , 3D HNCACB ( 16 scans , 1024 ( 1 H , 10 . 58 ppm at 4 . 696 ppm ) x 64 ( 15 N , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) x 150 ( 13 C , 58 ppm at 41 ppm ) complex points , 22 h 2 min ) , 3D ( H ) N ( CA ) N ( N ) H ( 16 scans , 1024 ( 1 H , 10 . 58 ppm at 4 . 696 ppm ) x 128 ( 15 N ( t 1 ) , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) x 128 ( 15 N ( t 2 ) , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) complex points , 10 h 23 min ) , 3D ( HACA ) N ( CA ) CON ( 24 scans , 1024 ( 13 C , 7 ppm at 173 . 1 ppm ) x 90 ( 15 N ( t 1 ) , 33 . 4 ppm at 123 . 4 ppm ) x 90 ( 15 N ( t 2 ) , 33 . 4 ppm at 123 . 4 ppm ) complex points , 1d 22 h 42 min ) , 3D ( HACA ) N ( CA ) NCO ( 88 scans , 1024 ( 13 C , 7 ppm at 173 . 1 ppm ) x 90 ( 15 N ( t 1 ) , 33 . 4 ppm at 123 . 4 ppm ) x 90 ( 15 N ( t 2 ) , 33 . 4 ppm at 123 . 4 ppm ) complex points , 4d 4 h 14 min ) were recorded . A 4D HNHsNs Covariance map ( Harden & Frueh , 2018 ) [ 47 ] was calculated from HNCO , HN ( CA ) CO , CBCA ( CO ) NH , and HNCACB to prevent errors in peak picking and ensure that sequential residues were reliably assigned . All experiments were run with non - uniform sampling using a 10 % NUS sampling factor , processed in nmrPipe ( Delaglio et al , 1995 ) [ 48 ] , Porter , Li et al . , 2023 , manuscript 33 and analyzed in CARA methods from Keller , 1996 [ 49 ] . In the end , all residues of ABI1 - HHR could be assigned except for the first two N - terminal residues . NMR titrations . 15 N ABI1 - HHR and 15 N ABI1 - HHR - DelEx4 were titrated with HOXB4 DNA with stoichiometries 1 : 0 . 47 , 1 : 0 . 94 , 1 : 1 . 9 , 1 : 3 . 75 , and 1 : 7 . 5 and monitored by NMR . 15 N ABI1 - HHR , 15 N ABI1 - HHR - DelEx4 , and HOXB4 were buffer exchanged into the same freshly prepared buffer solution . The titrations were performed at constant protein concentration ( 80 µM ) by mixing solutions of free ABI1 with those of ABI1 in presence of DNA at various concentrations , starting with a solution with 7 . 5 equivalent of DNA ( 600 µM ) . 1 : 375 was obtained by mixing free ABI1 with 1 : 7 . 75 in equal amounts , 1 : 1 . 9 by mixing free ABI1 with 1 : 3 . 75 , 1 . 094 by mixing free ABI1 with 1 : 1 . 9 , and 1 : 0 . 47 by mixing free ABI1 with 1 : 0 . 94 . All samples contained 10 % D 2 O and 200 μM sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate ( DSS ) chemical shift referencing . All titration points were recorded sequentially in the order mentioned above at a temperature T = 20ºC as calibrated with methanol . This data collection scheme ensures that chemical shift perturbations report exclusively on binding and are not tainted by sample degradation . 15 N - 1 H HSQC experiments were run with 16 scans , 1024 ( 1 H , 16 ppm at 4 . 696 ppm ) x 256 ( 15 N , 25 ppm at 120 . 5 ppm ) complex points ( 2 h 45 mins ) . Chemical Shift Perturbations were calculated with an in - house MATLAB script using the formula from Williamson , 2013 [ 50 ] : ! " 1 2 % ∆𝛿 ( 𝐻 !
