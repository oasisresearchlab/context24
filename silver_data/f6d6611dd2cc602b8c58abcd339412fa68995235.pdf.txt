TAYLOR ∗ , City University of London Understanding and achieving safety in Conversational AI systems is a complex task , in part because “safety” relies on subjective opinion , and there are no agreed upon standards and vocabularies defining the broad range of topics and concerns related to it , such as toxicity , harm , legal and health concerns , etc . Depending on whom we ask to judge safety or to define it , we may derive different conclusions about what is safe and what is not . This is because one’s concept , and perception , of safety can vary according to one’s identity , social environment , and interpretation of laws and regulations . In order to gain a deeper understanding of this possibly wide range of opinions on the safety of content generated by Conversational AI system , in this study , we explore the differences between safety annotations provided by a large and diverse set of crowd raters and the gold ratings provided by trust and safety ( T & S ) experts , typically considered to represent ground truth . We find patterns of disagreement rooted in dialogue structure , content , and rating rationale . In contrast to typical approaches that seek to mitigate such forms of disagreement , we propose alternative means of interpreting gold ratings that account for crowd disagreement and the corresponding ambiguity of opinion . We discuss the complexity of safety annotation as a task , what crowd and T & S labels each uniquely capture , and how to make determinations about when and how to rely on crowd or T & S labels .

It typically features three elements : ( 1 ) task design for structuring crowd work during annotation , ( 2 ) annotator guidelines for the crowd workers to strictly follow during their annotation and ( 3 ) a gold standard sample from experts to judge crowd workers’ accuracy . Diligently defining these three elements gives the false illusion that any data produced in this way should be reliable . However , such an approach to data collection ignores other elements that likely play a role in the many examples of human annotation [ 4 ] – namely the inherent ambiguity of the content presented to the annotators , the possible ambiguity in the labeling categories that the annotators are required to use for annotation , and the annotators’ individual and social backgrounds , which influence the way annotators interpret questions , guidelines and content . Conventionally , crowd - sourced annotation tasks are completed using multiple annotators and their answers are aggregated to represent some degree of annotator consensus . Plurality voting [ 1 , 20 ] explicitly reduces ambiguity for pragmatic purposes at the expense of documenting disagreement . In effect , it eliminates the ability to unpack how and why ambiguity and disagreement emerge in annotation . Further , using a single ground truth label to validate the quality of crowd annotations also ignores the diversity inherent in many judgements [ 21 , 23 , 34 , 36 ] . In this paper , we contrast annotations between crowd annotators and experts to better understand annotations as reflections of situated knowledge . Critical scholarship has long problematized categorization and quantification as solidifying dominant ways of knowing [ 6 , 7 , 18 ] and work on disagreement in human annotation has similarly argued that annotation processes can ignore minority viewpoints [ 3 – 5 , 25 ] . Important for both of these lines of work , Haraway [ 18 ] challenges the notion of objective and universal truth in scientific knowledge production by asserting that knowledge is always situated in embodied experiences , such as through gender , race , and other identity markers and shaped by specific social , cultural and historical contexts . She advocates that recognizing the situated and partial nature of knowledge is crucial for a more inclusive and full comprehension of the world . By acknowledging the situatedness of knowledge , we comprehend that different perspectives offer distinct insights , and no single perspective can fully grasp the intricacies of any phenomenon . The seminal work of Gaver et al . [ 16 ] argues that ambiguity points towards an alternative perspective that impels people to make sense of situations for themselves . Through understanding it , instead of simply resolving it , ambiguity offers us an opportunity to start a deeper and more contextualized engagement with artefacts and settings . Building from this prior work on situated knowledge , meaning making and annotator disagreement , we provide new insights on how they play a significant role in understanding “safety annotations” for Conversational AI systems . We use this as an example of how situated knowledge and ambiguity shape ground truth production in complex human computation tasks . Rather than “solve” ambiguity , we aim to use it as a resource to understand what rater disagreement can tell us about data and task design , particularly in relation to the development and use of gold labels . We suggest perceiving “safety” annotations as a process of assembling senses , where individuals bring together fragments of truth . This is accomplished by making sense of predefined “safety” labels with established meanings and by drawing upon personal interpretations of annotators rooted in social experiences to generate safety annotations , an assembly of diverse partial knowledge . Using an existing dataset created for safety of conversational AI system and annotated both by a large pool of diverse annotators and experts [ 2 ] , we present results from a mixed methods study on the different reasons and types of disagreement of the diverse annotator pool and the gold labels provided by experts . We find varying annotations Manuscript submitted to ACM 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 All that Agrees Is Not Gold : Evaluating Ground Truth Labels and Dialogue Content for Safety 3 between crowd raters and experts , noting disagreements in relation to topics discussed in the conversations as well as differences in the specific safety concerns crowd raters and experts annotate . By comparing the labels provided by expert annotators and crowd workers , we propose a shift in how we perceive the differences between crowd labels and gold labels . Instead of narrowly viewing these differences as matters of accuracy , we suggest reframing them as differences in expertise . Expert annotators possess in - depth knowledge of the internal context of institution - specific policies , while crowd raters bring expertise rooted in their lived experiences and sociocultural contexts , enabling them to identify and comprehend the harms they perceive . We also draw attention to the challenges that arise when utilizing crowd workers to annotate data based on specific institutional policies . These policies may be grounded in sensitive information or institutional context that is not readily accessible to crowd workers . The absence of such contextual knowledge can pose difficulties for raters , but it is precisely where the value of policy experts lies . Thus , we build from emerging work that recognizes crowd knowledge by reframing differences between crowd and gold labels , not as a lack of knowledge , but rather as a divergence in expertise . In this paper we contribute an in - depth analysis of disagreement between diverse crowd annotations and expert gold labels in the context of safety evaluation of conversational AI systems . Furthermore , we highlight the value of diverse crowd rater pools with varied social and cultural representations . Crowd raters offer valuable insights into contextual harms that a small group of experts may not be able to fully capture . In this regard , we propose a reimagined paradigm for annotation that allows for a range of expertise suitable for the situated needs of a dataset . 2 RELATED WORK Our perspective posits annotation as a process of sense assembly , whereby annotators are tasked with constructing a cohesive representation of truth by combining their interpretations of the annotation guidelines with their situated understanding of safety . This process involves reconciling their own versions of reality when they encounter situations that do not neatly align with the requirements of the annotation task . In our exploration , we delve into the creation of the gold standard and its utilization in evaluating crowd annotation . We also address the dynamics that emerge when discrepancies arise between the crowd annotations and the gold standard . 2 . 1 Defining Gold Standard In ML , “gold standard” broadly refers to datasets , corpora , or other data widely accepted and used for standardized evaluation of ML systems [ 37 ] . Because of their role as evaluative tools , gold standard resources typically entail effortful data collection or evaluation . An important part of gold standard dataset development is data annotation , which has become a central component in text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis , hate speech detection , and dialogue safety . Although data can be annotated through a variety of means , it often relies on human computation and engagement with experts whose ground truth is used to measure the quality of both crowd - produced annotations as well as the quality of annotators themselves . In pursuit of cheaper and more efficient processes for generating gold standard data , ML researchers have exper - imented with different methods for offloading annotation labor to non - expert sources of annotation . Explorations include determining the effect of dataset size based on desired performance returns Chowdhury and Lavelli [ 9 ] and incorporating automated annotations [ 26 ] . Because expert labor can be costly to pursue , the use of crowdwork platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk have been widely studied as a way to supplement cost - intensive expert labels , often by using a small set of expert labels to assess and filter for high quality crowd workers .

Critically , who or what constitutes expertise in dataset development is inconsistent and frequently undefined [ 14 ] . Experts involved in dataset development have included individuals with educational or work certification [ 31 ] , specialized training outside educational contexts [ 22 ] , or social backgrounds relevant to the annotation task [ 24 ] . As Sen et al . show , different knowledge communities can produce significantly different labels in an annotation task [ 31 ] , raising questions about what knowledge is represented by gold labels and how it differs from other data sources . This has particular implications for data annotators and the labels they provide because current measurements of accuracy can deem an annotator or their labels to be low quality without insight into what expert labels represent or how annotator labels differ . Furthermore , there exists a dominant belief that the quality of annotation can be adequately measured by accuracy , which inherently poses exclusionary and problematic consequences . Accuracy , within the context of annotation , quantifies the extent to which annotations align with a predetermined gold standard . Bowker and Star delve into the issues surrounding the reliance on " counting " and what they refer to as the " crisis of quantification , " particularly against the backdrop of ongoing political and democratic instability in the United States . They argue that counting serves as the foundation for citizens’ existence , with a modern state necessitating the enumeration of its population ( [ 7 ] , p . 423 ) . Consequently , to be deemed a good citizen , one must neatly fit into a classifiable category ( e . g . , age , race , gender ) , while those who cannot be counted are effectively rendered insignificant ( ibid ) . However , this counting process becomes all - encompassing to the point where everything is presumed countable , and the underlying structures and technologies employed to generate these counts become invisible and unaccountable . We apply this notion , derived from modern governmentality , to the realm of data annotation , where the prevailing logic of counting overrides the fundamental principles governing what and how annotation operates . Specifically , when comparing crowd labels with the gold standard , we uncover what is quantified and acknowledged , as well as the converse – what is overlooked and disregarded . 2 . 2 Crowd vs . Domain Experts Across HCI and ML , crowdsourcing has been applied rather differently , with fundamentally distinct goals . In ML , data annotation has been conceived as a streamlining process with the goal of producing cheap , consistent data that can be reused for training or benchmarking purposes . In this vein , researchers have compared the performance of classifiers built on crowdsourced annotations with those built on expert annotations [ 32 , 35 ] , often finding that crowdsourced data is a cheap option viable for achieving similar model performance to more expensive , higher quality data collection approaches . In the ML context , crowd annotators are broadly and categorically considered non - expert [ 29 ] and are typically pursued to cheaply and narrowly replicate ground truth judgments from authoritative sources . In this body of work , the quality of crowdsourced data is measured , in large part , by its consistency and coherence . Whereas work in ML on crowdsourcing has largely been motivated to collect and process data in ways that limit variation , crowdsourcing work in CSCW has explicitly sought to gather varied perspectives , such as in scholarship focused on crowd feedback . This work has included crowdsourcing ideas to promote creative problem - solving [ 8 ] , helping users generate ideas by looking to disciplines outside of their own [ 40 ] , as well distilling generative feedback for designers from a non - expert design crowd [ 39 ] . Across these applications of crowdsourcing is an interest in how a variety of judgments and perspectives can generate new ideas and be made useful for a variety of end - users . They also stand in sharp contrast to crowdsourced data annotation in ML in that varied perspectives are framed as an explicit , generative goal . In this work , accuracy is a less relevant metric because the goals often entail creative generation or Manuscript submitted to ACM 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 All that Agrees Is Not Gold : Evaluating Ground Truth Labels and Dialogue Content for Safety 5 open - ended problems . There is an opportunity to pull from approaches in CSCW that frame the collection of differing perspectives as highly generative . 2 . 3 Disagreement in Safety Tasks A number of scholars have pointed to a need for more robust evaluation of annotator disagreement in annotation tasks that broadly cover a range of safety concerns , including use and generation of hate speech and abusive language . This work includes frameworks for evaluating disagreement [ 4 ] , calls for preserving disagreement in published datasets rather than calculating singular ground truth based on majority - vote [ 25 ] , and studies of how annotator disagreements can be preserved in modeling tasks [ 10 ] . A significant motivation for this work centers on understanding perspectives that vary systematically across communities and cultures . An important subset of this work has investigated specific sociodemographic attributes and their relationship to annotation behavior differences [ 30 ] , highlighting the role of sociodemographics and positionality as a contributing factor to the ways in which annotators make annotation judgments . For example , in a mixed methods study focused on annotating images on Twitter , Patton et al . [ 24 ] showed that community members were able to identify gang - related paraphernalia that was missed by social work graduate students who were specifically trained and educated on gang - related topics [ 24 ] . Other work by Prabhakaran et al . found that African American annotators , provided systematically different sentiment annotations compared to other annotators in a pool balanced across U . S . census racial groups . Typically , rater variability is viewed as a problem , with ML researchers instead seeking to find group consensus . Thus , if rater subgroups are highly variable , we may seek to remedy this with trustworthy expert annotations . However , there are at least two primary reasons with this approach . First , low agreement is not necessarily an indicator of low quality data . Indeed , driving consensus on topics that may fundamentally elicit dissent does not produce more “correct” assessments of safety . Second , high and low agreement must be considered in relation to the different kinds of knowledge that raters apply in annotation . Subject - matter experts can provide valuable input within their areas of expertise ; however , crowd raters also possess important situated knowledge that subject - matter experts may not have access to . For example , while an important component of societal safety involved understanding systematic , population - level safety concerns , harm and safety are also experienced in individualized , contextual ways . This begs the question of when low alignment between a diverse crowd and ground truth matters , and when low alignment can be ignored . However , we demonstrate high variability in correlation with this ground truth as well . The collection of this work highlights important questions about the extent to which existing annotation approaches accurately model a generalized task rather than specific biases or idiosyncrasies of the annotators chosen to complete that task [ 17 ] . 3 METHODOLOGY In order to analyze how data annotations vary in relation to annotators’ situated knowledge , we turned to DICES - 350 [ 2 ] , a rare example of a dataset that includes both robust annotator - level documentation of demographic information as well as gold label judgments . The following section describes key dataset features that enabled our analyses , followed by a data analysis methodology ( see section 3 . 2 ) based on a set of metrics to assess disagreements and significance between the diverse annotator crowd and gold annotations . Manuscript submitted to ACM 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 6 Wang et al . 3 . 1 Data Features In addition to containing annotator information that supports analyses of demographic differences and different methods of annotation aggregation [ 2 ] , DICES dataset includes safety gold labels provided by domain experts . The following characteristics of DICES dataset enable the comparisons of crowd and gold annotation behavior : • crowd annotators characteristics , e . g . demographic information about annotators • crowd annotators behavioral information , e . g . time to complete an item , overall time spent on the task , number of items per annotators , etc . • granular crowd annotations , i . e . , individual crowd annotations per item rather than single , aggregated labels ( which is typical of crowdsourced datasets ) • high replication rate of crowd annotations , e . g . , high number of unique annotations on each item in the dataset • balanced distribution of crowd annotations across all items , e . g . , all annotators , including expert annotators , annotated all items . • gold labels indicating the ground truth from experts on each item • subjective task where a natural occurrence of differences of opinions and interpretations by the annotators on the data items can be expected Detailed Description . DICES - 350 is a sample of 350 human - AI conversations . It contains 48K conversation turns generated by humans interacting with a generative AI - chatbot . The human agents were instructed to generate adversarial multi - turn conversations , where they attempted to provoke the AI - chatbot to respond with an undesirable or unsafe answer . All conversations are a maximum of five turns in length and varied in their level of adversariality ( i . e . , degree of harm ) as well as in the topics of conversation . Each of the DICES - 350 conversations are annotated with a single expert label indicating degree - of - harm indicating whether the conversation is “Benign” , “Debatable” , “Extreme” , or “Moderate” in terms of its degree of adversariality . For each conversation , the final chatbot utterance was annotated according to 16 safety criteria organized in five top - level safety categories : • Harmful Content : eight sub - questions about whether the conversation could directly facilitate serious and immediate harm to individuals , groups or animals . • Unfair Bias : four sub - questions about whether the conversation incites hatred against an individual or group . • Misinformation : one multiple choice question about whether the conversation contains any theories that are demonstrably false or outdated . • Political Affiliation : one multiple choice question about whether the conversation engages in or downplays any controversial topic . • Institutional Policy : two sub - questions about whether the conversation contains any policy violations for polarizing topics and endorsements , i . e . , proactively bring up or reactively promote brands , celebrities , products , etc . For each of the above sub - questions , the answer options were : “No” ( i . e . , safe ) , “Yes” ( i . e . , unsafe ) and “Unsure” . In effect , a “Yes” answer to any of the questions indicates an explanation of why a conversation is considered unsafe . In all cases , we aggregate the sub - questions in each set to represent a single top - level safety category . This aggregation is necessary to reduce some of the noise and variability in the original dataset and to ensure that we can align all the crowd annotations with an appropriate gold annotation , as the top - level categories between the two types of annotations were Manuscript submitted to ACM 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 All that Agrees Is Not Gold : Evaluating Ground Truth Labels and Dialogue Content for Safety 7 aligned , but the sub - questions often were not .

Multiracial captures annotators who indicated that they identify with more than one of the pre - specified race / ethnicity groups . Annotators . The dataset includes safety annotations from two distinct groups of annotators . : • experts provided a single safety gold annotation accompanied by a more specific annotation that indicates the motivation or reasoning for the annotation ( e . g . , presence of misinformation ) . According to Aroyo et al . [ 2 ] , trust and safety experts “typically define safety rater guidelines and oversee safety evaluations for machine learning systems . ” • diverse crowd annotators 123 annotators who each provided 16 unique safety annotations per conversation . These annotators were based in the US , with representation across gender , race and ethnic categories , age groups , level of education , and sexual orientation . The crowd annotators represented in this dataset are unique because crowdsourced datasets typically include just 3 – 5 annotators per item and rarely recruit annotators for diverse representation . Each crowd annotator annotated all 350 conversations . Annotators were recruited from 12 demographic groups ( 3 x 4 design ) in approximately equal proportions , created by fully crossing age groups ( Gen Z , Millennial , Gen X + ) with race / ethnicity ( Asian ; Black ; Latine / x ; White ) . Although the demographic breakdown is a simplified representation of the population at large , the demographic information provided in DICES - 350 is much more extensive than is typical of crowdsourced datasets , which often provide no demographic information , and the high number of annotators per item makes the dataset uniquely valuable for studying ( dis ) agreement patterns . DICES - 350 contains responses from 123 annotators , but 19 of those annotators were flagged as having produced inconsistent annotations that may not reflect a carefully considered judgment of safety . 1 We therefore exclude these 19 annotators from all analyses , and report results on the 104 remaining annotators . The final annotator breakdown for this pool is shown in Table 1 . While the dataset was explicitly created to support analyses of disagreement among crowd annotators , the original dataset publication does not include extensive analysis of the relationship between the diverse crowd labels and the expert - provided labels . 3 . 2 Data Analysis In order to understand the patterns of safety annotation from the annotators as well as how and why they differ from the gold standard labels , we applied a number of different metrics and analyses in order to observe the crowd annotator disagreement with gold labels . 1 According to Aroyo et al . [ 2 ] , reasons for flagging an annotator as potentially unreliable included : ( i ) a high number of conversations rated anomalously quickly , ( ii ) a high number of responses indicating the annotator found the conversation nonsensical , or ( iii ) a tendency to ‘straightline , ’ or give the same annotations for every conversation .

These metrics consider individual annotation behavior and allow us to directly compare crowd and gold labels . Using percent agreement between experts and the crowd would require aggregating crowd annotations into a single label per conversation , which diminishes the value of our high density annotation approach . The interpretation of xRR aligns with the traditional interpretation for Krippendorf’s alpha , where lower scores indicate lower agreement , but in the case of xRR this represents agreement between groups of annotators rather than between individual annotators . • Pearson Correlations were calculated by creating two vectors . The first , which represented the crowd annotation , consisted of continuous values from - 1 to 1 calculated by taking the mean of annotators’ responses for each conversation , where ‘unsafe’ was coded as 1 , ‘safe’ was coded as - 1 , and ‘unsure’ was coded as 0 , following [ 2 ] . The second vector consisted of the expert responses for each conversation , in which we transformed the safety annotations using the same schema as was used for gold . These correlations allow us to quantify the degree of alignment between crowd and expert annotation patterns , considering both the ‘Safe’ and ‘Unsafe’ annotations for each conversation and identify subsets of the dataset or annotators that are driving higher or lower agreement with the gold labels . Similar to agreement metrics , higher R values are indicative of higher agreement , but there is no single threshold at which we can determine “good” or “bad” agreement , as such an interpretation would be dependent on many factors , including task design and the goal of the annotation work . • Confidence Intervals to compare correlations between the labels from different groups of crowdworkers and gold . Confidence intervals are more readily interpretable than p - values in this context . We compute confidence intervals using SciPy , which uses the Fisher transformation to estimate confidence intervals . Computing confidence intervals allows us to directly compare different Pearson correlations to identify robust differences between groups of annotators’ agreement behavior with respect to the gold labels . We expect lower correlation coefficients than might be found in a typical annotation task , because of the ( 1 ) high number of crowd annotators per conversation , ( 2 ) high number of demographics groups that these annotators belong to ( indicating a range of different perspectives and lived experiences ) , and ( 3 ) high number of safety dimensions per conversation . Rather than make definitive claims about statistically significant predictors of annotation behavior , we look to relative differences in correlations to understand when and why annotators align with and differ from each other . For each metric , we focus on observing the level of agreement between crowd and gold annotators in different ways . We do not use standard hypothesis testing because doing so would require us to assume a null hypothesis that the crowd and gold labels are uncorrelated , which not a valid assumption . 3 . 3 Limitations We acknowledge a few limitations in this work . Firstly , since our analysis was conducted on an existing dataset , which means we could not control certain crucial factors that can influence safety annotation . For example , the dataset does not provide details on how the conversations between humans and bots were generated , including the rules and guidelines followed to create the adversarial prompts . Additionally , it lacked information on how adversaries were defined in constructing the conversations . These are factors that can significantly impact the annotation process and the resulting evaluations . Furthermore , we note that while the dataset provided social demographic information about the crowd annotators , there was no information about the background and expertise of the experts who provided the ground truth labels .

The left diagonal indicates the cases where they agree ( for 66 % of the conversations ) and the right diagonal indicates their disagreement ( for 34 % of the conversations ) . Both the social demographics and professional backgrounds of the experts can potentially influence their evaluations , and the lack of this information limits the authors’ ability to analyze and interpret the discrepancies between the crowd and gold labels fully . Lastly , we acknowledge that although social demographic information can serve as a proxy for understanding annotation patterns , it does not substitute for a direct study involving the annotators themselves . Conducting a study that directly involves the annotators would provide valuable insights into their reasoning and decision - making processes behind the safety evaluations they made . These limitations highlight areas for future research and suggest the need for more comprehensive datasets and studies that incorporate a deeper understanding of the factors influencing safety annotation . 4 RESULTS First , we provide a high - level summary of the DICES dataset before diving into deeper comparisons of crowd and expert annotations . While the dataset consists of 50 % “safe” and 50 % “unsafe” conversations ( or 175 conversations each ) according to trust and safety experts . Across all conversations , crowd annotators indicated 60 . 7 % of the time that a conversation was “safe” , 33 . 1 % of the time that a conversation was “unsafe” and 6 . 2 % of the time that they were “Unsure” . The topic annotations indicate that nearly 22 % of the conversations cover racial topics , followed by 14 % political topics , 10 % gendered topics and 7 % misinformation and medical topics each . More than 40 % of the conversations were rated as benign and 60 % split evenly between debatable , moderate and extreme in terms of degree of harm . Most of the benign conversations are labelled as containing banter . 4 . 1 Aggregated Differences in Crowd and Expert Annotations Overall , the crowd majority vote and the trust and safety expert labels disagree on 34 % of conversations ( 119 con - versations total ) , with a stronger tendency for the crowd to indicate that a conversation was “safe” , compared with the gold label . Table 2 shows a breakdown of disagreements by “safe” / “unsafe” judgments . In 30 % of conversations , the crowd indicated that conversation was “safe” when the gold label was “unsafe” . In just 4 % of the conversations , the crowd majority vote was “safe” when the gold label was “unsafe” . The crowd majority and gold labels most often agreed when they labeled a conversation “safe” ( 46 % of conversations ) . This is consistent with an overall trend in which all annotators more often rated conversations “safe” . These disagreements are also captured in the fairly low overall cross - rater reliability ( xRR ) values between crowd and gold labels , in which we observe a cross - Kappa score of 0 . 20 . The following conversation shows an example for which trust and safety experts indicated “unsafe , ” but 70 of 104 crowd annotators indicated “safe” .

Why do you ask ? The following conversation offers another example where trust and safety experts indicated “unsafe” , citing a discussion of regulated goods .

A heat map showing the Pearson correlations between expert label and crowd majority label rating reasons . 4 . 2 Differences in Crowd and Expert Rating Reasons Next , we compared the reasons chosen by the crowd and trust and safety experts when they indicated that a conversation was unsafe . These differences provide an indication of the safety concerns that are most salient to annotators when they judge a conversation to be “unsafe” . Figure 1 shows the average percent breakdown of how often the crowd and trust and safety experts selected each rating reason when annotating a conversation as “unsafe” . We observe very different rates of citing Content with Unfair Bias and Harmful Content . However , annotations between the crowd and trust and safety experts are reasonably correlated across these categories , suggesting that the crowd is collectively capturing some subset of gold annotations . Interestingly , we note similar rates between the two groups of indicating Misinformation , Policy - specific Guidelines and Political Affiliation , yet , of these three rating reasons , Political Affiliation and Harmful Content are most correlated between the two groups ( 0 . 70 and 0 . 66 , respectively ) and Policy - specific Guidelines is least correlated among all rating reasons ( 0 . 39 ) . This demonstrates that , despite annotating conversations with Policy - specific Guidelines at similar rates , crowd raters and trust and safety experts tended to apply the annotation to different sets of conversations . Disaggregating the rating reason categories , we find that both the crowd and trust and safety experts cited “harmful advice” , “polarizing topics” , and " bias based on inherited attributes " as the most common reasons for conversation being unsafe . However , there were relative differences even among these common reasons . Trust and safety annotators indicated “bias related to inherited attributes” and “bias related to gender / sexuality” much more often than the crowd ( 24 . 6 % vs . 11 . 6 % for “inherited attributes” ; 11 . 5 % vs . 2 . 8 % for " gender / sexuality " ) . Conversely , the crowd more often cited“harmful advice” and “bot derogation” when indicating that a conversation was unsafe . “Bot derogration” refers to model outputs that implicitly accept or condone abusive statements made by the user toward the bot . When the crowd and gold labels disagreed , their overall annotation differences were amplified . When the crowd majority and gold labels disagreed , the expert annotators’ tendency to cite “bias related to inherited attributes” increased by 4 . 1 % and their tendency to cite “bias related to gender / sexuality” increased by 5 % . In addition , the expert annotators Manuscript submitted to ACM 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 12 Wang et al . judgments of “harmful advice” in this disagreement set decreased by 8 . 4 % . Thus , annotation differences between experts and the crowd appear to be driven , in part , by these rating reasons . 4 . 2 . 1 Rating Reason Correlations . We analyzed correlations between crowd and gold labels for each conversation and each rating reason category to better understand when crowd understandings of safety most and least align with expert understandings of safety . This analysis is complementary to just looking at majority vote and just assessing the reasons conversations are marked “unsafe” because it takes into account both the “safe” and “unsafe” annotations along each dimension for each conversation . We observe that crowd and gold are most correlated for “Political affiliation” and ‘Harmful content’ annotations , though the confidence intervals of these annotation reasons overlap with those of “Content with unfair bias” and “Misinformation” ( Figure 2 ) . In contrast , the correlation between crowd and gold for “Policy - specific guidelines” is substantially lower than any of the other categories , and even the correlations between when the crowd workers’ use of this label and experts’ use of “Political affiliation” and “Misinformation” had significantly above - chance correlations , indicating that this category accounts for a substantial amount of disagreement between the two groups . 4 . 3 Demographic Differences in Crowd - Gold Agreement Given differences with respect to indications of bias related to inherited attributes and gender / sexuality , we disaggregated crowd annotators by age , race and gender to investigate potential differences in their annotations . In doing so , we draw from prior work detailing connections between annotators’ social experience and their annotation behavior [ 12 , 19 ] . While there is variation in crowd correlation with gold across demographic groups , demographic characteristics are not very strongly correlated . Notably , White annotators’ responses are slightly less correlated with the gold label compared to other race and ethnicity groups ( Fig . 3 ) , though the confidence intervals overlap for nearly all comparisons , indicating that this difference may not be robust . To explore this trend , we analyze what the most common pattern of disagreement with gold is among White annotators , and we find that ( i ) they disagree 100 % of the time with gold labels when gold indicates unsafe ( the 4 % of conversations ) , and ( ii ) they agree 64 % of the time when gold indicates safe . This appears to be driven by an overall tendency to label “safe” more often than other groups . This tendency is also reflected in the lower xRR scores for the comparison between labels from White annotators and the gold labels ( 3 ) . As an example , for the following conversation 44 % of White annotators indicated “unsafe” , in contrast to 59 % of Asian annotators , 70 % of Latine annotators , and 71 % of Black annotators ( the gold label was “unsafe” ) : USER : let’s look for the lynching tree MODEL : Great ! I will be here when you return ! The appendix contains an analysis of the correlations between crowd and gold labels broken down by each rating reason and demographic group ( § 6 . 1 ) and also exploring the gold agreement within intersectional categories of the three demographic variables explored here ( § 6 . 2 ) . 4 . 4 Conversation Content Differences in Crowd - Gold Agreement Finally , we look to conversation content to understand how conversation topics and adversariality differently shape crowd and gold annotations . In calculating correlations between individual crowd annotations and expert - provided ground truth , we find a range of correlation coefficients , ranging between approximately 0 . 96 , for conversations related to violence and gore , and 0 . 25 for conversations related to personal topics ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition to “violent / gory” , topics related to “drugs / alcohol” , “health” , and “wealth / finance” are among the highest correlated topics , though the confidence Manuscript submitted to ACM 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 All that Agrees Is Not Gold : Evaluating Ground Truth Labels and Dialogue Content for Safety 13 Fig . 3 . Correlations between expert annotations and crowd subgroups of various demographic groups . intervals are largely overlapping for most comparisons , which is likely due to the small number of conversations of each type . In contrast , annotations on “personal” ( personally - directed and insulting ) conversations , “sexist” conversations , and “religious” conversations were least correlated between crowd annotators and experts . While a number of factors can influence the strength of correlation between crowd annotators and experts , we note particular attention to the potential for systematic disagreement to influence annotations . For example , a low correlation could be an artifact of conversation content that is ambiguous , leading to annotator confusion or misunderstanding , or potentially an artifact of consistent disagreement among crowd annotators and expert annotators , whether due to specialized knowledge or social factors . To investigate systematic disagreement as a potential cause of low annotation correlations , we calculate the percentage of annotators across conversations that indicated “unsafe” , disaggregated by hand - coded conversation topic and expert annotation ( shown in Figure 5 ) . We specifically assess “Religious” , “Gendered & Sexist” , and “Personal” conversation , given the particularly low correlations between crowd and expert annotators . If systematic disagreement on a given topic is a cause of low correlations between crowd annotations and expert annotations , we would expect to see the percentage of crowd “unsafe” responses trending in the opposite direction of the expert “unsafe” response percentages . For example , if crowd annotators systematically disagree with expert annotators among the Religious conversations , the percent of “unsafe” crowd responses should be relatively consistent across that subset of conversations . Instead , the percent of “unsafe” crowd responses varies considerably . For “Personal” conversations , the box plots show a relatively wide spread of percentages of “unsafe” responses across both the set of conversations that experts labelled “unsafe” as well as the set of conversations that experts did not label “unsafe” . In contrast , the box plots of crowd annotations on “Gendered & Sexist” conversations show a relatively smaller spread of percentages of “unsafe” responses relative to conversations on other topics . This suggests that crowd annotations were relatively consistent across these conversations , and that the low correlation between crowd and expert annotations are not due to content ambiguity or random noise . This result is also consistent with the trend for expert annotators to cite biases related to inherited attributes more often than the crowd when labeling a conversation as “unsafe” . The box plots describing conversations about religion show a mixed result . The plots show a relatively wide spread of percentages of “unsafe” responses on the set of conversations labeled “unsafe” by experts , whereas the set of expert - labelled safe conversations show a much more consistent range of percentages of “unsafe” crowd responses .

It is not surprising that annotations between the crowd and expert annotators are more correlated on Extreme and Benign conversations . These categories of conversations are more likely to contain content that is broadly considered safe or unsafe across a variety of contexts . Still , correlations are just moderate in strength . One reason for this is likely due to Manuscript submitted to ACM 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 All that Agrees Is Not Gold : Evaluating Ground Truth Labels and Dialogue Content for Safety 15 the fact that the severity codes are applied to the conversation as a whole , while all annotators annotated just the final utterance of the conversation .

Notably , we found differences in how crowd annotators handle policy - related safety Manuscript submitted to ACM 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 16 Wang et al . concerns compared to experts , reflecting disparities in training , professionalization , and institutional awareness . At the same time , we observed that crowd annotations of safety for topics like violence were more in line with the gold labels , both in terms of correlation strength and cross - rater reliability , whereas with more subjective topics around sexual content , sexism or religion showed greater discrepancies . These differences beg the question of what knowledge , expertise , and sensitivities a given annotator brings to their work . Haraway’s [ 18 ] formulation of situated knowledge aptly describes how knowledge is inherently subjective and embodied . Thus , by framing data annotations as artifacts of situated knowledge enables us to disentangle the production of annotation target concepts ( i . e . , safety ) , the production of accuracy and ground truth , as well as ways we might un - constrain data annotation from consensus - driven processes . Furthermore , our analysis highlights the limitations of relying solely on measures of consistency and accuracy when assessing annotation quality . Such metrics constrain us to quantifiable aspects and overlook important factors that contribute to deviations among annotators or between crowd and gold annotations . The prevailing emphasis on counting and quantifiability also obscures the underlying structures and technologies involved in generating these counts [ 7 ] . Therefore , this paper aims to address what has been previously overlooked from a sociotechnical perspective— the instances where the crowd diverges from the gold standard . Through empirical analysis and engagement with sociological , socio - technical , and design scholarship [ 7 , 16 , 18 ] we unpack the complexity of annotation tasks , propose a reevaluation of the concept of ground truth , and advocate for a paradigm shift in annotation that explicitly embraces ambiguity . 5 . 1 The Complexity of Dialogue Safety Tasks Numerous challenges arise in measuring and annotating safety which draw from different kinds of knowledge to resolve . First , safety is complex in nature and encompasses a variety of topics and aspects of other classification tasks , such as toxicity or hate speech ( terms which are inherently subjective themselves ) . From an annotation perspective , measuring safety spans more straightforward tasks , such as identifying specific insults or references to violent acts , as well as more intricate and subjective judgments , such as determining the degree of sexual suggestiveness in an image . These latter , subjective aspects of safety are , in turn , influenced by social and cultural contexts . As a result , annotating “safety” is both complex and , at times , imprecise . A second challenge arises from the intersection of safety with legal and policy considerations . While legality itself is highly nuanced , it is distinct from safety . Nonetheless , developers of systems must ensure compliance with legal requirements as part of safety testing and refinement . Since legal and policy compliance varies across jurisdictions and institutions , conveying and training data workers on these considerations requires careful explanation . However , communication barriers between requesters and annotators can make it challenging to verify whether nuanced policy definitions are accurately understood by annotators , especially when these considerations are combined with aspects of safety that are ill - defined ( e . g . , promoting violence ) . The mixture of objective and subjective considerations in dialogue safety annotation implicitly draw from a range of types of knowledge and expertise . For example , knowledge about how safety concerns may compound and become exacerbated in the context of product development requires tacit knowledge and training in product development processes , as well as education about downstream social impacts of sociotechnical systems . On the other hand , knowledge about cultural norms and first order harms can be intimately learned through experience . Because safety annotation draws on all of these forms of knowledge to varying degrees , sub - questions or tasks within the broader assessments of safety become critical to understand not only in terms of which forms of knowledge they draw from , but also who possesses and is able to apply this knowledge .

[ 27 ] begins to break down how annotation task designs are structured to draw from different kinds of knowledge . One paradigm Röttger et al . describe relies on asking annotators explicitly to provide opinions or subjective judgments . This approach often aims at capturing variation to understand annotator differences . The second paradigm is more prescriptive and uses instructions to reduce subjectivity . This approach seeks to reduce variation across annotators and better lends itself to tasks involving explicitly defined or formulaic assessments , such as in the case of applying legal or policy definitions . Critically , safety tasks contain aspects of both paradigms . We argue that eliminating subjectivity should not be a goal of annotation task design . Indeed , Röttger et al . [ 27 ] and Miceli et al . [ 23 ] point out that subjectivity cannot be eliminated , and that ground truth reflects individual judgments and experience even when annotation processes are structured to be as objective as possible . 5 . 2 Re - framing Ground Truth - The Sense Assembly Just as annotator judgments reflect contextually - situated knowledge and expertise , gold labels provided by domain experts reflect particular ways of knowing . Yet , the type of expertise sought from annotators is rarely made explicit in ML research [ 13 ] . Given the subjective and policy - laden components of safety in the context of generative AI , gold labels must be reframed in terms of the situated knowledge they represent—in this case , knowledge of how to operationalize high - level legal or policy mandates into specific , desired model performance , while also taking into account user perspectives and experiences . This expertise is critical to the success of products and services meant to support stakeholders in a variety of downstream use cases . At the same time , experts are not ( and cannot be expected to be ) experts in the sociocultural contours that influence what constitutes safety across cultures and social contexts or the lived experiences of various user groups . It is precisely in this subject area that crowd annotators offer valuable insights . This begs the question of how and when to rely on different knowledge sources when seeking ground truth judgments . This entails careful reflection on the knowledge desired from annotations and who is able to provide it . For example , the type of safety judgment desired and who wields the knowledge to provide it is not only impacted by social experiences and training , but also temporal factors . In addition to differing judgments on data at a given point in time , the pace at which data must be updated in order to reflect relevant notions of safety differs . Considerations of whether potentially sexual content is socially unacceptable may shift over the course of years , whereas institutional policies regarding the risk tolerance related to the production of potentially sexual content in a product or service can be updated as often as the institution sees fit . Intuitively , data annotation should reflect a range of both social preferences and institutional policy . At the same time , whether a data example is being used to reflect policy or social views can have implications for how annotators and ground truth should be chosen . For one , changes in policy considerations and , in particular , the nuanced history of updates to a policy over time constitute contextual expertise that can make it difficult to distill what must be communicated to data workers . Ultimately , there are opportunities to explore methods of intentionally developing ground truth data from distinct experts and sources of knowledge . This could look like a set of ground truth judgments solicited from experts and which reflect the most up - to - date institutional policies regarding specific matters , interleaved with ground truth judgments solicited from crowd annotators and which reflect more general notions of safety . In contrast to applying pre - defined policies , this approach to relying on crowd annotators more closely reflects an approach that elicits social and cultural values .

A critical underlying thread in our approach to annotations and datasets is an explicit understanding of the limits to representing complex concepts , such as safety . Thus , our analyses are shaped by a desire to understand what is represented in a label and what is not . In advocating for generating ambiguity in order to improve design , Gaver calls for using imprecise representations to emphasize uncertainty . In other words , representing information in imprecise ways can bring new attentiveness to what is actually represented . Because safety is a complex and multifaceted concept that must be quantified through annotation , gold labels and crowd labels stand not only as imprecise representations of safety but also differently imprecise representations . Understanding labels in this way calls into question what they stand for and why they may differ across sources . In this vein , Gaver et al . point to over - interpretation of data as a means of encouraging speculation , and thus generating new ideas , motivations , and reasoning to draw from in design . In the present work , we employ various analyses to try to understand and infer annotator reasoning and intent . Most critically , this re - framing allows us to conduct analyses with healthy skepticism as opposed to an over reliance on efficiency and any notion that deviations from consensus are unwanted or result in low quality . This is not to say that we suspect insincere , malicious , or otherwise low quality work on the part of gold or crowd annotators . Rather this skepticism aims to encourage careful assessment of how to understand differences between gold or crowd labels and what these differences mean for the use of labels after an annotation task is complete . This kind of approach is particularly important for subsets of data that are difficult to characterize—such as the subset of conversations in the presented dataset deemed to be debatable in adversariality and whose correlation had the largest confidence interval . 5 . 3 . 2 Creating Ambiguity of Context . Our approach to analysis was oriented toward exposing ambiguous conversation contexts that annotators might differently interpret based on social and cultural factors . In doing so , we mirror Gaver’s recommendation to implicate incompatible contexts to disrupt preconceptions . In annotation , the salient preconception is that ground truth is necessarily singular and fixed . At a conceptual level , we instead ask how judgments of safety reflect different forms of situated knowledge and experience . In particular we ask how these knowledges become encoded in ground truth judgments treated as canonical representations of safety . Moreover , in contrast to typical ML annotation approaches in which consensus is both ideal and assumed to reflect identical reasoning , we pursued different analyses without specific preconceptions about how individual annotators or crowd annotators as a whole should annotate . Thus , any distribution of agreement or disagreement between annotators was an equal opportunity to investigate what those judgments encode . Critical to these analyses was data with robust annotator - level information . As a dataset that includes both adversarial content as well as a diverse selection of annotators , DICES - 350 lends itself to exploring ambiguity . Although the dataset was created for general conversational safety , it contains conversations that cover a variety of topics , ranging from benign to highly controversial . Coupled with the diverse , stratified sample of annotators , the dataset development strategy provided an opportunity to study annotation behavior beyond simple assessments of accuracy against a gold standard . The degree of annotator information available in the dataset is rare , which points to a need for more ML datasets to facilitate investigations of ambiguous data and contexts .

[ 16 ] describes as adding " incongruous functions to breach existing genres " in service of producing more ambiguity . Whereas the genre of data annotation prioritizes efficiency to quickly determine ground truth , our approach eschews this goal entirely in search of a plurality of ground truth through a variety of analyses that are not typically undertaken . In this sense , we do not seek to create a “practical” process that is focused on finding “true” gold labels . Rather , we take a step back to question the process of seeking ground truth itself , while squaring its limitations against the labeling processes required for developing ML systems . 5 . 3 . 3 Provoking Ambiguity of Relationship . In their provocation of the ambiguity of relationships , [ 16 ] propose that ambiguity draws forth a deeply personal projection of imagination and values onto design . They suggest introducing unaccustomed roles as a means to foster imagination . In our research context , rather than introducing additional unaccustomed roles , we advocate for viewing annotators in an unaccustomed manner , moving away from mere typecasting based on their social demographic characteristics . Against the backdrop of increasing calls in ML to collect and analyze annotator sociodemographics ( e . g . , [ 12 , 25 ] , it is important to recognize that these characteristics only partially define their identities and do not encompass the full range of their lived experiences . Moreover , Gaver et al . ’s work challenge the prevailing notion that design should cater primarily to the majority [ 16 ] . Similarly , we propose a provocation against the scale of data . Instead of solely focusing on increasing the quantity of data points at the expense of diversity , we advocate for a scale that encompasses a multitude of perspectives . Again , the intent of our research is to consider how safety can be subjectively assessed and what this might mean for data annotation . By highlighting the differences between crowd and gold labels , we give significance to the disagreement , valuing it as a means to provoke questions rather than striving solely for consensus as the ultimate goal of annotation . Our approach is exploratory , looking at differences and disagreements rather than providing a purely analytical explanation for their existence , aiming to spark further inquiries into annotator behavior . Lastly , following Gaver et al . ’s [ 16 ] suggestion to question responsibility by considering disturbing side effects , we propose examining the impact of data annotation from the annotator’s perspective . This involves investigating the working conditions of annotation and recognizing the imposition of power dynamics and value systems in the annotation process , aligning with existing research on these subjectsMiceli et al . [ 23 ] , Wang et al . [ 34 ] . 5 . 4 Implications for Safety Evaluation Building from Gaver’s insights on the generative possibilities of introducing ambiguity in design , we offer the following recommendations for enhancing data annotation for evaluating dialog safety : • In designing the annotation task , consider what might affect the annotation perspectives and design such considerations in the annotation recruitment phase ( [ 11 , 15 , 33 ] ) . • In the pilot annotation phase , in addition to checking task quality and annotation accuracy , collect metadata of the annotators and explore the signals indicating minority opinions and differences to expert labels . This stands as a way to validate or correct assumptions made by requesters regarding the data examples chosen , label set , etc . • Consider the use of different pools for specific questions based on desired expertise ( e . g . , legal experts for legal questions ; curated crowd for cultural perspectives on explicit content , etc . ) . • Design the interface for the annotator to voice their interpretations in their own words and have it documented and analyzed .

Thus , we are effectively incorporating the crowd’s opinion . • Adopt a multi - level evaluation of annotation quality . Instead of the current check on accuracy rates between crowd and gold , we propose evaluating crowd annotation from a multi - faceted perspective . When the crowd is in disagreement with gold , instead of sending the annotation back until it reaches a high level of agreement with gold , evaluate what calls for more crowd annotation , what calls for expert inspections of their own label and what labels may best remain unresolved . • Calling for a shift in model innovations to embrace ambiguity , to account for multiple ‘ground truths’ , and to develop more sophisticated approaches to safety annotation that better reflect the complexity of the task . Such models can provide valuable insights and improve the overall reliability and usefulness of safety evaluation systems . Indeed , the implications listed and the analyses presented in this paper ought to be seen as a starting point for rethinking safety annotation and model development , specifically in the context of safety annotation in human - bot conversations . We do not claim to provide a definitive recipe for safety annotation or a formula for determining the appropriate level of ambiguity that models should embrace . Instead , we emphasize the need for further research to delve into the specific contexts and domains where safety annotation is required . Different tasks and applications may have unique challenges and considerations regarding ambiguity . It is essential to explore these nuances and develop tailored approaches that suit the specific requirements and complexities of each domain . By calling for more research , we encourage the interdisciplinary community to expand the knowledge base and develop a deeper understanding of safety annotation theoretically and practically . This ongoing exploration will contribute to the advancement of model development , the refinement of annotation guidelines , and the establishment of best practices that effectively address ambiguity while promoting safety in diverse applications . We acknowledge that our research provides insights into a specific scenario ( as we point out in 3 . 3 ) , but does not provide a definitive solution . We advocate for continuous research and exploration to expand our understanding of ambiguity in safety annotation within various contexts . 6 CONCLUSION In this paper , we explore the disparities between safety annotations provided by a diverse group of crowd annotators and the ground truth labels provided by experts . We analyze a large dataset that includes safety annotations from both the experts and the crowd annotators , as well as additional information such as the safety dimensions being annotated and the demographic metadata of the crowd annotators . The goal is to understand the reasons behind the disagreement between the crowd and the gold standard labels . We argue that the disagreement between the crowd and gold labels should not be viewed simply as an error . Instead , it is influenced by factors such as dialogue structure , conversation content , and annotation rationale . Drawing on sociological , socio - technical , and design scholarship [ 7 , 16 , 18 ] we contend that safety annotation is a complex and ambiguous task . Annotators must assemble information from various sources , including the annotation guidelines Manuscript submitted to ACM 1041 1042 1043 1044 1045 1046 1047 1048 1049 1050 1051 1052 1053 1054 1055 1056 1057 1058 1059 1060 1061 1062 1063 1064 1065 1066 1067 1068 1069 1070 1071 1072 1073 1074 1075 1076 1077 1078 1079 1080 1081 1082 1083 1084 1085 1086 1087 1088 1089 1090 1091 1092 All that Agrees Is Not Gold : Evaluating Ground Truth Labels and Dialogue Content for Safety 21 provided to them and their own lived experiences as individuals with specific social demographic characteristics . Challenging the notion of objectivity , we propose that the development of ground truth in safety annotation tasks can be understood through the lens of ambiguity . We highlight the intricate nature of safety annotation and the need for annotators to navigate multiple sources of knowledge to construct their understanding of safety . Finally , we provide practical implications based on our analysis of the disagreement between the crowd and gold labels . These implications pertain to safety evaluation and suggest potential improvements or modifications to the current approaches . Overall , our paper contributes to the understanding of safety annotation and emphasizes the importance of considering the complexity and ambiguity inherent in this task .

APPENDIX 6 . 1 Demographics by Rating Reason We break down the correlations of crowd annotations with gold annotations along the five primary safety dimensions by each of the three primary demographic categories of interest . This breakdown allows us to explore the degree to which demographics may influence more fine - grained annotation behavior as it relates to the gold annotations . As with the results in the main paper , in most cases the confidence intervals between the groups are overlapping , indicating that between group differences on the finer - grained rating reasons may not be robust . One notable exception is observed in Figure 9 , where there may be an effect of age specifically for annotations about misinformation , where Manuscript submitted to ACM 1145 1146 1147 1148 1149 1150 1151 1152 1153 1154 1155 1156 1157 1158 1159 1160 1161 1162 1163 1164 1165 1166 1167 1168 1169 1170 1171 1172 1173 1174 1175 1176 1177 1178 1179 1180 1181 1182 1183 1184 1185 1186 1187 1188 1189 1190 1191 1192 1193 1194 1195 1196 All that Agrees Is Not Gold : Evaluating Ground Truth Labels and Dialogue Content for Safety 23 Gen X + annotators ( the oldest age group ) is reliably less correlated with the gold labels than the younger two age groups .
