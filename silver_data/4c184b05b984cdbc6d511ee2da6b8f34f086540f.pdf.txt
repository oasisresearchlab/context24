This allows excitation at longer wavelengths , which is less harmful or toxic to biological samples , induces less autofluo - rescence 11 , 17 and enables multiplexing of several FRET sensors . Unfortunately , the aforementioned drawbacks of current mRFPs seriously limit their use in FRET experiments . Therefore , we focused on engineering a novel bright monomeric RFP with a high quantum yield and complete maturation . Rather than evolving from a tetrameric natural ancestor , we designed a synthetic gene template to start the development of a new monomeric RFP . We based the template on mCherry and multiple other naturally occurring RFPs and chromo proteins ; and we used knowledge about residues at the outer barrel surface to break the dimerization interfaces . We dubbed this template ‘mRed7’ ( Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Remarkably , mRed7 was fluorescent when expressed in bac - teria . However , it exhibited a very low fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield . We performed two rounds of multiple site - directed mutagenesis using the OmniChange method 18 , targeting the simultaneous change of multiple amino acid residues in the inte - rior of the beta - barrel in an unbiased manner ( Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . The resulting libraries of new RFP variants were initially screened mainly for increased fluores - cence lifetime in bacteria . Because the fluorescence lifetime is pro - portional to the quantum yield but not dependent on expression level , sample thickness or maturation efficiency , it allows for direct screening of the intrinsic brightness of FPs as shown previously for the evolution of mTurquoise and mTurquoise2 ( refs . 19 , 20 ) . Following the multiple site - directed mutagenesis strategy , the RFPs were subjected to several rounds of random mutagenesis and screened for both increased brightness and proper matura - tion ( i . e . , minimal dead - end green chromophore formation 21 ) by ratiometric screening using a cotranslated mTurquoise2 protein as reference ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Eventually , we obtained three monomeric RFPs with distinct properties : a very bright mRFP with a high quantum yield that we dubbed ‘mScarlet’ and two variants with a single amino acid substitution , called ‘mScarlet - I’ and ‘mScarlet - H’ ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The normalized absorbance emission spectra indicate that the mScarlet variants are genuine RFPs ( Fig . 1a ) with mScar - let absorbance and emission maxima of 569 nm and 594 nm , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Of note , the fluorescence lifetime of mScarlet is 3 . 9 ns , the highest value recorded to date for mRFPs ( Fig . 1b and Table 1 ) , and it shows monoexponential decay ( Supplementary Fig . 4 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . The quantum yield of mScarlet is 0 . 70 ; much higher than the quantum mscarlet : a bright monomeric red fluorescent protein for cellular imaging Daphne S Bindels 1 , 4 , Lindsay Haarbosch 1 , 4 , Laura van Weeren 1 , Marten Postma 1 , Katrin E Wiese 1 , Marieke Mastop 1 , Sylvain Aumonier 2 , 3 , Guillaume Gotthard 2 , 3 , Antoine Royant 2 , 3 , Mark A Hink 1 & Theodorus W J Gadella Jr 1 We report the engineering of mscarlet , a truly monomeric red fluorescent protein with record brightness , quantum yield ( 70 % ) and fluorescence lifetime ( 3 . 9 ns ) . We developed mscarlet starting with a consensus synthetic template and using improved spectroscopic screening techniques ; mscarlet’s crystal structure reveals a planar and rigidified chromophore . mscarlet outperforms existing red fluorescent proteins as a fusion tag , and it is especially useful as a förster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) acceptor in ratiometric imaging . Fluorescent proteins ( FPs ) have become indispensable in biologi - cal research 1 . After the cloning of GFP from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria 2 , several GFP spectral variants were developed , including blue , cyan and yellow FPs 3 . The palette of FPs was greatly expanded after the cloning of red FP ( RFP ) homologs from corals and other Anthozoa species 4 , 5 . However , all Anthozoa RFPs form obligate tetramers , which can seriously interfere with localization and functioning of RFP - fusion proteins . Monomerization of tetrameric RFPs was accompanied by a serious deterioration of the bright - ness and incomplete and / or partial green maturation of the result - ing monomer 6 . After the development of the first monomeric RFP ( mRFP ) , mRFP1 ( ref . 6 ) , several improved mRFPs have been reported : mCherry 7 , mApple 8 , TagRFP ( - T ) 8 , 9 , mKate2 ( ref . 10 ) , mRuby2 ( ref . 11 ) , mRuby3 ( ref . 12 ) and FusionRed 13 ( reviewed in ref . 14 ) . But all these mRFPs are dimmer than their tetrameric ancestors ; they have quantum yields below 50 % , and several still harbor additional problems due to incomplete or partial green maturation and a residual tendency to dimerize 15 . Spectral variants of FPs can be applied in FRET - based biosen - sors to probe molecular interactions , conformational changes and metabolite concentrations within living cells 16 .

The extinction coefficient of mScarlet is 100 , 300 M −1 cm −1 , resulting in the highest calculated brightness in the mRFP spectral class , with a > 3 . 5 - fold increase relative to mCherry . Brightness analysis in mammalian cells confirmed that mScarlet is an extremely bright mRFP ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig . 5a – j ) , especially when compared with mRuby2 , mRuby3 and TagRFP - T . Its p K a of 5 . 3 indicates that mScarlet is very tolerant to acidic environments ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The maturation speed of mScarlet in cells favorably compares with maturation speeds of existing mRFPs ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . The single amino acid sub - stitution T74I found in mScarlet - I results in a marked maturation acceleration in cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , but at the cost of a moderate decrease in fluorescence quantum yield ( 0 . 54 ) and fluorescence lifetime ( 3 . 1 ns ) , although both values are still higher than those of all previously engineered bright mRFPs ( Table 1 ) . mScarlet bleaches with simple kinetics ( Supplementary Figs . 8 and 9 ) and can be used for prolonged imaging at normal light doses ( < 0 . 5 W cm −2 ) . Screening for a more photostable mScarlet variant yielded mScarlet - H , with a single amino acid substitution ( M164H ) causing a > 2 - fold improvement in photostability ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , albeit accompanied by a serious decrease in quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime . Using the organized smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( OSER ) approach 22 , the mScarlet series proved to be monomeric in mamma - lian cells , with over 75 % of cells showing normal phenotypes ( see Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figs . 10 and 11 ) , whereas mKate2 , mRuby2 and mRuby3 did not pass the OSER test , with the latter two accumulating in the Golgi apparatus ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . To investigate the structural basis for the high quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime , the crystal structure of mScarlet was solved at 1 . 47 Å at the near - physiological pH of 7 . 8 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . The relative positioning of the two conjugated rings of the chromophore is the most striking difference between the crystal structures of mCherry and mScarlet . This difference is at the six - membered ring ( phenolate ) , which is out of plane in mCherry and almost perfectly in plane in mScarlet ; the two dihedral angles controlling their planarity are as high as 26° and −13° in mCherry and only 1° and −2° in mScarlet ( Fig . 1c ) . The two key mutations to explain this are M164 on the side and R198 on top of the phenolate moiety , which provides two sets of strong van der Waals interactions ( Fig . 1c ) that are virtually absent in mCherry . In addition , the introduction of the bulky F178 induces an upward movement of residue 164 , which in turn forces the chromophore to adopt a planar conformation . Another striking feature is that the stabilizing R198 is held in place particu - larly well by a cobweb composed of numerous hydrogen bonds connecting water molecules and a number of hydrophilic residues that are different from mostly hydrophobic residues in mCherry ( Fig . 1c ) . This cobweb ensures that both the water molecules , R71 and R198 , are rigidly held against the chromophore . We assume that the planarity of the chromophore and the rigidified surrounding cobweb are the key structural features causing the high quantum yield of mScarlet . Consistent with its high brightness , monomeric behavior and low p K a , the mScarlet series performs well in fusion constructs and in labeling various cell organelles ( Fig . 2a – f , Supplementary Results , Supplementary Fig . 13 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . Furthermore , a cytotoxicity test in HeLa cells showed that the mScarlet series belong to the least cytotoxic mRFPs and clearly out - perform mRuby2 , mKate2 and mCherry ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Importantly , the profound difference in fluorescence lifetime between mScarlet and mScarlet - H ( with equal fluorescence emission spectra ) can be used for lifetime unmixing experiments ( see Supplementary Results and Supplementary Fig . 15 ) .

Third in line is mApple ( Fig . 2g , h ) . However , mApple shows severe photochromic behavior 8 . Since this is highly undesirable for FRET acceptors , the photochromic behavior of the new mScarlets and existing RFPs was further examined by alter - nately exciting the RFPs with 556 - nm and 448 - nm light ( Fig . 2h and Supplementary Figs . 17 and 18 ) . Negligible photochromic behavior was measured for the mScarlet variants , while TagRFP - T , mRuby2 , mRuby3 and mApple showed 15 % , 19 % , 41 % , and 51 % photochromic behavior , respectively . Hence , extreme care must be taken when using the latter four RFP variants as acceptors in FRET studies , since a photochromic effect is easily confused with a changed FRET state , especially if one considers that the typical FRET contrast in many sensors is in the range of only 5 – 20 % . The photochromic behavior can also interfere with characterization of FPs , like determination of photostability ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) or brightness ( Supplementary Fig . 5l ) . To demonstrate beneficial features of mScarlet - I in single - chain dynamic ratiometric FRET biosensors , we created new single - chain green – red RhoA ( GR - RhoA ) sensors from the DORA – RhoA sensor23 . Following histamine - triggered GPCR signaling , RhoA is acti - vated by guanine exchange , which is reflected by enhanced FRET . Notably , the GR - RhoA sensor with mScarlet - I yields a much higher change in sensitized emission compared with the GR - RhoA sensor with mCherry ( Fig . 2i and Supplementary Fig . 19 ) . Finally , the performance of mScarlet was evaluated in a mul - timeric ratiometric FRET biosensor reporting on phosphati - dylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) levels in cells 24 . Histamine - triggered GPCR signaling can decrease PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in seconds ( Fig . 2j ) , and indeed a substantial FRET ratio change was observed upon activation . While YFP ( de ) quenching is roughly equal , a much higher sensitized emission change ( > 2 . 5 - fold ) was detected for mScarlet and mScarlet - I when compared with mCherry , underlining the superior behavior of mScarlet and mScarlet - I as acceptors in FRET biosensors ( Fig . 2j and Supplementary Video 2 ) . In conclusion , ( see Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Fig . 20 ) we describe the development of three new mRFPs : mScarlet , the brightest and highest quantum yield mRFP in its spectral class ; and two variants , mScarlet - I with enhanced maturation and mScarlet - H with improved photostabil - ity . All three mScarlets show great performance in protein fusions and in cellular functional imaging . mScarlets do not show com - plications due to photochromicity , cytotoxicity , unwanted resid - ual dimerization in cells or incomplete maturation . Therefore , mScarlets are the preferred FPs in the RFP spectral class for cellular microscopy and quantitative functional imaging . methods Methods , including statements of data availability and any associated accession codes and references , are available in the online version of the paper .

If applicable , the AgeI and / or BsrGI rec - ognition sites within sequence that encoded the DNA of the RFP were removed by using a silent mutation at the amino acid level . mRuby3 ( ref . 12 ) was ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies as a synthetic human codon optimized DNA sequence ; mRuby2 ( ref . 11 ) was obtained from the plasmid pcDNA3 - mRuby2 ( 40260 , Addgene ) and was a gift from M . Lin ( Department of Bioengineering , Stanford University , Stanford , California , USA ) . mKate2 ( ref . 10 ) was a kind gift from D . Chudakov ( Shemiakin - Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry , Russian Academy of Science , Moscow , Russia ) . TagRFP - T 8 was created by intro - ducing the S158T mutation into a plasmid containing TagRFP 9 . mApple 8 was cloned from the plasmid Myo1E – pmApple – C1 25 ( 27698 , Addgene ) and was a gift from C . Merrifield ( Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell , Gif sur Yvette cedex , France ) . mCherry 7 and tandem dTomato 7 were kind gifts from R . Tsien ( University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , California ) . The dTomato plasmid was created from the tandem dTomato ( tdTomato ) by cloning only one dTomato sequence in the C1 Clontech plasmid . A general purpose dual expression system with two FPs was created , containing mTurquoise2 ( ref . 20 ) and an RFP of inter - est ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . The gene is regulated by a CMV promoter ( 70823 - 3 , Merck Millipore ) and rhamnose - inducible promoter ( 49011 , Lucigen corporation ) for mammalian and bac - terial expression , respectively . The CFP and RFP are linked with a large linker in bacteria 26 and not linked in mammalian cells on account of a P2A sequence 27 . The dual expression vector was used for the fluorescence lifetime imaging ( FLIM ) screen , the ratiomet - ric screen ( RFP brightness and green component ) , the photosta - bility assay using widefield microscopy , the assay for measuring photochromic behavior , brightness in mammalian cells , and mat - uration kinetics . The RFP sequences were cloned into this plas - mid by using AgeI and BsrGI restriction sites . The mTurquoise2 , large spatial linker , and P2A sequences were removed from the plasmid using NheI restriction sites . The plasmid with only RFP was used for protein isolation , FLIM measurements in bacte - ria and as template for random mutagenesis . In this situation a 6×H - tag is fused to the N terminus of the RFP . Quantum yield and side mutagenesis libraries were constructed with the OmniChange method 18 using the primers shown in Supplementary Table 1 . Random mutant libraries were con - structed using Genemorph II ( 200550 , Agilent ) , up to four amino acid changes per FP size ( 232 amino acids ) . PCRs were performed with Pfu DNA Polymerase and Phusion High - Fidelity polymerases according to manufacturer’s protocol ( EP0502 and F532S , Fermentas ) . All primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies . For bacterial screening and protein isolation , chemically com - petent E . cloni 5 - alpha cells ( Lucigen corporation ) were used and transformed according to the manufacturer’s heatshock protocol . Super optimal broth ( SOB , 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) yeast extract , 2 % ( w / v ) tryptone , 10 mM NaCl , 20 mM MgSO 4 , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 100 mg / ml kanamycin , and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) rhamnose to induce transcription ) was used as bacterial growth medium . SOB medium was sup - plemented with 1 . 5 % ( w / v ) agar for agar plates . Most mammalian cell imaging was conducted with U - 2 OS cells ( HTB - 96 , ATCC ) unless stated differently . Mammalian cells were grown on round cover slips ( Menzel , no . 1 , 24 mm diameter , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , in DMEM ( 61965059 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( 10270106 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and 100 U ml −1 Penicillin – Streptomycin ( 15140122 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) under 7 % humidified CO 2 atmosphere at 37 °C . Polyethylenimine ( PEI ) in ddH 2 O ( 1 mg / ml , pH 7 . 3 , 23966 , Polysciences ) was used as a transfection reagent unless stated otherwise . The transfection mixture was prepared in Opti - MEM ( 31985047 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with 3 – 4 . 5 µ g PEI and 200 – 800 ng plasmid . The transfection mixture was incu - bated for 20 – 45 min . Cover slips were mounted in an AttoFluor cell chamber ( A7816 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and microscopy medium ( 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) was added . Bacterial screening . The RFP library was transformed into bacteria and plated on SOB agar plates . The bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C . To further complete maturation the Petri dishes were left at 4 °C for several days . FLIM screen . A 561 nm continuous wave laser of 200 mW ( Genesis MX 561 - 500 STM , Coherent ) was used for excitation . The excitation light was modulated at 75 . 1 MHz as previously described 28 . Additional hardware and analysis of the FLIM screening setup has been previously described 19 . For the detection of RFP fluorescence , a dichroic mirror 595 nm ( 600dcxr , Chroma Technology Corporation ) and a 630 / 60 nm emission bandpass filter ( HQ630 / 60 , Chroma Technology Corporation ) were used . Ratiometric screen . A Petri dish adaptor ( tube , diameter , 100 mm ; and length , 760 mm ) was installed on the stage of an Eclipse Ti - E ( Nikon ) equipped with an Intensilight Epi - fluorescence Illuminator ( Nikon ) . One of the objectives was replaced with an 80 cm focal lens ( FL 800 , Melles Griot ) . For cyan detection the excitation light was filtered using a 448 / 20 nm bandpass ( FF01 - 448 / 20 , Semrock ) . The excitation light was directed to the sample with a 466 nm dichroic mirror ( Di02 - R442 , Semrock ) , and the emission light was filtered with a 482 / 25 nm bandpass ( FF01 - 482 / 25 , Semrock ) . For green detection a 500 / 24 nm excitation bandpass ( FF01 - 500 / 24 , Semrock ) , a 523 nm dichroic mirror ( Di02 - R514 , Semrock ) , and a 542 / 27 nm emission bandpass ( FF01 - 542 / 27 , Semrock ) were used . For red detection , a 556 / 20 nm excitation bandpass ( FF01 - 556 / 20 , Semrock ) , a 577 nm dichroic mirror ( Di02 - R561 , Semrock ) , and a 609 / 54 nm emis - sion bandpass ( FF01 - 609 / 54 , Semrock ) were used . The micro - scope stage and filter wheels were controlled by a ProScan III unit ( ProScan H31 , Prior Scientific ) . Images were recorded by an ORCA - Flash4 . 0 V2 Digital CMOS camera ( C11440 - 22CU , Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Three images using ( in sequence ) red , cyan , and green detection settings were acquired of each Petri dish . These three images were also recorded of an empty SOB agar plate and stored as background image in the NIS - elements software ( Nikon ) . The background was subtracted , after which the red / cyan and red / green fluorescence ratios were determined by NIS - elements software . Colonies with increased fluorescence ratios , and therefore producing improved RFP variants , were selected for further optimization . © 2 016 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4074 nature methods Protein purification . Bacteria were transformed and 100 µ l of recovery culture medium was transferred to 50 ml growth medium ( see “General” ) . The cultures were grown overnight ( 200 r . p . m . , 37 °C ) and an additional 6 h incubation at 21 °C was applied to improve maturation . The cultures were washed twice with buffer - A ( 20 mM Tris – HCl , 200 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , and the pellets were stored at −20 °C . The pellets were defrosted and incubated on ice with 5 ml buffer - A supplemented with lysozyme ( 1 mg / ml , L7651 , Sigma - Aldrich ) and benzoase nuclease ( 5 unit / ml , Merck / Millipore , 71205 - 3 ) . The lysate was centrifuged ( 30 min , 40 , 000 g , 4 °C ) . The supernatant was added to Ni 2 + loaded His - Bind resin ( Novagen , 69670 - 2 ) and incubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C . The resin was washed three times with buffer - A and eluted with 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 M imidazole ( in buffer - A ) . The eluent was filtered ( 0 . 22 µ m ) , and the protein solution was dialyzed overnight in 20 mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 using 3 . 5 kD membrane tubing ( 132720 , Spectrum Laboratories ) . Proteins were short - term stored at 4 °C or flash frozen and stored at −80 °C for long - term storage . Spectroscopy . Extinction coefficient . Purified proteins were diluted in PBS ( 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 – NaH 2 PO 4 , 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) . Absorbance spectra were acquired with a spectrophotometer ( Libra S70 , Biochrom ) . The spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 260 – 700 nm with a step size of 1 nm . PBS was used as a background reference . The samples were diluted such that the absorbance of the red chromophore peaked between 0 . 2 and 0 . 3 . To denature the RFPs , 10 – 30 µ l 10 M NaOH was subsequently added to the samples as well as to the reference cuvette , which was directly mixed by pipetting . Spectra were acquired continuously after addition of the sodium hydrox - ide until the absorbance spectra showed a complete loss of the absorbance peak associated with the red chromophore and dis - played only the peak associated with the green chromophore at 457 nm . This absorbance spectrum was used for further analysis ; and , if necessary , the average absorbance value in the wavelength range 670 – 680 nm was subtracted from the spectra , in order to correct for a minor offset . The concentration of the denatured green chromophore was calculated assuming an extinction coef - ficient of 44 , 000 M −1 cm −1 at 457 nm for the green chromophore in the denatured RFP 29 , 30 . Based on the concentration of the red chromophore , the extinction coefficient for the red chromophore was determined at the maximum absorbance wavelength . The above procedure was repeated three times per RFP variant , and the average extinction coefficient and the average RFP absorbance spectra ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) were calculated . Quantum yield . Purified proteins were diluted in PBS ( 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 – NaH 2 PO 4 , 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) . Absorbance spectra were recorded with a spectrophotometer ( Libra S70 , Biochrom ) in the wavelength range 260 – 700 nm with a step size of 1 nm . PBS was used as a background reference . Four dilu - tions of each RFP variant were prepared with an absorbance at 540 nm ( A 540 ) of 0 . 005 < A 540 < 0 . 05 . Fluorescence emission spectra were taken from the same sample cuvette with a fluorimeter ( LS 55 with red sensitive PMT R928 detector , PerkinElmer ) . The excitation wavelength was set at 540 nm , the emission spectrum was recorded from 550 to 800 nm with a step size of 0 . 5 nm at a scan speed of 150 nm min −1 . The excitation as well as the emission slits were set at 2 . 5 nm . The average RFP emission spectra were calculated from the four dilutions ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Absorbance spectra were corrected for a minor offset by sub - tracting the average absorbance at 670 – 680 nm from the entire spectrum , if applicable . Fluorescence spectra were background corrected by subtracting a spectrum measured with PBS . The emission spectra were corrected for spectral sensitivity , and the spectral area ( I em ) was obtained by integrating from 550 – 800 nm . The absorbance at 540 nm ( A 540 ) was plotted versus the area under the emission spectrum , subsequently the slope of the line was determined using linear regression . The regression lines were constrained to go through the origin , hence I em = a × A 540 . Equation ( 1 ) was used to calculate the quantum yield : QY QY s r s r = a a ( ) 1 In equation ( 1 ) QY denotes the quantum yield ( s and r denote sample and reference RFP , respectively ) , and α corresponds to the acquired slope . The effect of unequal refractive indices is omitted from equation ( 1 ) because all measurements were performed with water as solvent . dTomato was used as a reference with a quantum yield of 0 . 69 ( ref . 7 ) . Fluorescence lifetime . Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed at an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with a PicoHarp 300 TCSPC module ( PicoQuant , Germany ) . Purified RFP proteins ( section protein purification ) were diluted in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 4 and meas - ured in a blackened glass - bottom cell imaging plate with 96 wells ( 0030741030 , Eppendorf ) placed at the microscope . Samples were excited using a 561 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser ( LDH - D - TA - 560 , PicoQuant ) operating at 20 MHz , using an Olympus UPLS Apo 60× water NA 1 . 2 objective lens . The fluorescence signal was detected for 180 s in confocal mode with the pinhole diameter set at 150 µ m at a fixed position . The fluorescence passed through a 455 / 570 dichroic mirror ( ZT445 / 561rpc - UF2 , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) and was filtered by a 593 / 40 nm emission filter ( FF01 - 593 / 40 , Semrock ) and detected with an avalanche photodiode ( MPD ) at 16 ps resolution . The decay curves were fitted over the whole timespan using a single or a sum of two exponential functions and were recon - volved with the instrument response function , IRF ( t ) , in the SymphoTime software ( Picoquant ) . The general model for single ( n = 1 ) or double ( n = 2 ) decay curves , h ( t ) was : h t t A t i i i i n ( ) / exp ( ) = + ⊗ −   ∑ bg IRF ( ) t t 2 where bg denotes the background intensity , A i denotes the ampli - tude parameter in total photon counts for fluorescence lifetime component i , and τ i denotes the fluorescence lifetime of com - ponent i . By visual inspection of the fit , the fit residuals and the reduced chi - square the fit quality was evaluated . Two measure - ments , which were highly reproducible , were performed per RFP variant . The estimated parameter values and standard errors of one fitted measurement are reported in Supplementary Table 2 . pH dependence of RFP fluorescence intensity . Fluorescence emission and absorbance spectra were acquired using a Synergy MX plate reader ( BioTek ) . Purified RFPs ( section protein puri - fication ) were diluted in a black µ - clear 96 wells plate ( 655090 , ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) © 2 016 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4074 nature methods Greiner ) . The samples were diluted to four different concentra - tions in a pH series ranging from pH 3 . 0 to pH 10 . 8 using 50 mM citric acid – sodium citrate buffer ( pH 3 . 0 – 5 . 0 ) , 50 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 – 8 . 0 ) or 50 mM sodium carbonate – sodium bicar - bonate buffer ( pH 9 . 2 – 10 . 8 ) . Absorbance was measured between 450 and 700 nm in steps of 4 nm to check protein concentration . Fluorescence emission spectra were generated using excitation at 540 nm and detection between 560 and 700 nm , using 4 nm steps . Both excitation and emission slits were set at 9 nm . The spectra were background corrected using the spectra of the cor - responding buffers , and the integrated area under the emission spectrum for each pH value was used as a measure for intensity at that particular pH . In order to remove the effect of dilution on the overall intensity , the dose – response curves were scaled to the mean dose – response curve . The dose – response curves of pH versus normalized integrated fluorescence of the four dilution series , F ( pH ) , ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) were fitted using the Hill function ( equation ( 3 ) ) in order to estimate the apparent p K a of the RFP and the Hill coefficient n : F pH F F F n K ( ) ( ) min max min ( ) = + − + − 1 10 3 p a pH After fitting , the curves and F min were normalized with the esti - mated F max . The normalized intensity at low pH then becomes f min = F min / F max . Determination of the mScarlet protein structure . Crystallization of mScarlet . mScarlet was isolated from a 1 l culture as described in the section “Protein purification . ” The protein solution was concentrated to A 569 ± 70 using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters ( UFC801096 , Merck Millipore ) . Trypsin - digested ( 1 / 100 w / w ratio for 2 h at 20 °C ) mScarlet was crystallized using the hang - ing drop method at 20 °C at a concentration of 8 – 10 mg ml −1 in 40 % PEG300 , 100 mM sodium phosphate – citrate buffer pH 4 . 2 . Crystal quality was improved using the microseeding technique 31 . In order to obtain a structure at a pH close to that of physiological conditions , a crystal was soaked for 45 min in 40 % PEG300 , 100 mM sodium phosphate – citrate buffer pH 7 . 8 . X - ray diffraction data collection and structure refinement . X - ray diffraction data were collected at 1 . 47 Å resolution on beamline ID29 of the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble 32 . The data set was integrated , merged and scaled in the C2 space group using the XDS package suite 33 . The structure of mScarlet was solved by the molecular replacement method with Phaser 34 , using the structure of PAmCherry1 ( 3kcs , PDB ) as a starting model . The complete model of mScarlet was built in Coot 35 and refined with Refmac5 ( ref . 36 ) . Data collection and refinement statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 3 . The mScarlet structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under ID 5lk4 . Photostability . Screening for photostability in mammalian cells . An RFP mutant library was transformed into bacteria as described in “General . ” The DNA of individual RFP mutants was isolated . U - 2 OS cells were grown in Ibitreat µ - plate 96 - well ( 89626 , Ibidi ) . Each well was transfected with 300 ng plasmid and 1 µ g PEI in 20 µ l Opti - MEM . The culture medium was replaced by microscopy medium directly before imaging . The same microscope setup as described in the “Ratiometric screen” was used . Here the sample ( 3 ) ( 3 ) was placed directly in the stage holder , and a 20× CFI Plan Apochromat NA 0 . 75 ( MDR00205 , Nikon ) was used . The sample was excited with a mercury lamp line filtered at 556 / 20 nm , result - ing in a local light density above the objective of 6 . 9 W cm −2 , and the red settings were used for detection . A timeseries was acquired for each well for 3 min , recording an image every 3 s . The acquisi - tion was fully automated by NIS - elements software ( Nikon ) . The images were background subtracted . The mean intensity of all cells was calculated per frame and normalized to 1 at the initial timepoint ( t 0 ) . The timepoint where the fluorescence intensity was decreased to 50 % of the initial fluorescence intensity was cal - culated ( t 1 / 2 ) . Also , the percentage of final fluorescence intensity after 3 min was determined . The mutants with a prolonged t 1 / 2 and elevated percentage of final fluorescence intensity were selected for further optimization . Widefield bleaching . U - 2 OS cells were cultured , transfected and mounted 1 d after transfection as described in “General . ” The same microscope setup as that described in “Ratiometric screen” was used . Here the sample was placed directly in the stage holder , and the light was focused using a 20× CFI Plan Apochromat NA 0 . 75 objective ( MDR00205 , Nikon ) . Cells were positioned and focused using cyan settings to pre - vent any red prebleaching ( 0 . 36 W cm −2 ) . For the photobleaching acquisition , red settings were used . Only the center part of the camera chip was used to ensure homogenous illumination , result - ing in 3 – 8 imaged cells per acquisition . For the first 10 s the camera acquired images at high speed ( ~ 8 ms per frame ) ; during the fol - lowing 3 min , one image was acquired every 3 s . The sequence was finalized by acquiring one image per 5 s . The total acquisition time was adjusted for each RFP variant in order to reach at least 50 % decrease of the initial intensity at the final image . The continuous excitation light was manually switched on within the first 5 s of the camera acquisition in order to fully capture fast kinetics . During the bleaching experiments , the light intensity above the objective at the focal plane corresponded to 6 . 9 W cm −2 for all RFPs . Confocal spinning disk bleaching . mTurquoise2 from the Histon 2A containing plasmid pmTurquoise2 – H2A ( 36207 , Addgene ) was replaced with RFP variants ( mScarlet , mScarlet - I , mScarlet - H , mRuby2 , mKate2 , TagRFP - T , mApple , mCherry or dTomato ) by digestion with AgeI and BsrGI . U - 2 OS cells were cultured as described in “General . ” The cells were cotransfected with 4 . 5 µ g PEI and 100 – 500 ng of each plasmid ( pmTurquoise2 – H2A and pRFP – H2A ) . 1 d after transfection , cells were mounted as described in “General . ” Images were acquired on an Eclipse Ti - E ( Nikon ) microscope equipped with 405 nm and 561 nm lasers ( for cyan and red detec - tion , respectively ) and a Yokogawa CSU X - 1 spinning disk unit ( operating at 5 , 000 r . p . m . ) . The excitation light was directed to the sample via a custom - made dichroic mirror 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 through a 100× APO TIRF 100× 1 . 49 oil objective ( Nikon ) . For cyan and red detection , the emission signal was filtered with a 482 / 25 nm bandpass ( FF01 - 482 / 25 , Semrock ) and 500 - 535 / 580 - 690 bandpass ( FF01 - 512 / 630m , Semrock ) , respectively . The signal was recorded by an iXon 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor ) . Cells were positioned and focused using cyan settings to prevent any red prebleaching . The red setting was used for the acquisition . The illumination was continuous and switched on automatically from the first image . During the bleaching experiments , the illumination intensity was 1 . 35 W cm −2 , measured above the objective at the © 2 016 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4074 nature methods focal plane for all RFPs . For the first 20 s , images were acquired at maximum speed ( ~ 200 ms per frame ) , after which images were recorded every 3 s for the remaining time of the acquisition . The total acquisition time was adapted for each variant until the initial intensity was decreased by at least 50 % . Analysis . The time when the illumination was switched on was set to t 0 . The mean intensity was determined per cell , and the background was subtracted . The intensity at t 0 was normalized to 1 , 000 photons s −1 molecule −1 , and the time - axis was adjusted according to the method described by Shaner to correct for RFP - specific excitation and emission properties 8 . All cells were aver - aged , and average t 1 / 2 values ( 500 photons s −1 molecule −1 ) are given in Table 1 ( t 1 / 2 values are based on multiple cells from one to three acquisitions ) . The individual t 1 / 2 values obtained from all cells are displayed in Supplementary Fig . 9 . Photochromic behavior . The sample preparation and micro - scope setup was described in “Photostability . ” Cells were posi - tioned and focused using cyan settings ( 0 . 36 W cm −2 ) to prevent any red prebleaching . The cyan excitation light converted the photochromic variants to a brighter state . For acquisition , the excitation light was directed into the sample by a 577 nm dichroic mirror ( Di02 - R561 , Semrock ) , and the signal was filtered with a 609 / 54 nm emission bandpass filter ( FF01 - 609 / 54 , Semrock ) . The acquisition was executed at maximum speed ; at t 0 the illu - mination shutter was opened with a 556 / 20 nm excitation filter ( FF01 - 556 / 20 , Semrock ) . The excitation light was manually alternated between 556 / 20 nm at 6 . 9 W cm −2 and 448 / 20 nm at 11 . 5 W cm −2 every 2 s for three illumination cycles . The mean intensity was determined per cell and was background subtracted . The photochromic behavior was determined from the mean intensity immediately after ( I 2 ) and immediately before ( I 1 ) 448 / 20 nm induced switching . The photochromic amplitude ( Ph chr ) was calculated using equation ( 4 ) and is depicted with the blue arrow in Supplementary Figure 17 . Phchr = − × I I I 2 1 2 100 4 % ( ) Two to four acquisitions were performed per RFP variant . The average photochromic amplitudes are presented in Table 1 . The number of illumination cycles used to calculate the aver - age photochromic amplitudes were : mScarlet , n = 6 ; mScarlet - I , n = 12 ; mScarlet - H , n = 12 ; mRuby3 , n = 12 ; mRuby2 , n = 12 ; mKate2 , n = 12 ; TagRFP - T , n = 12 ; mApple , n = 12 ; mCherry , n = 12 ; dTomato , n = 9 . The individual values are displayed in Supplementary Figure 18b . Brightness in mammalian cells . U - 2 OS cells were grown as described in “General . ” The cells were transfected with 4 . 5 µ g PEI , 450 ng carrier DNA ( empty cloning vector ) and 35 ng mTur - quoise2 – P2A – RFP ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . The low plasmid concentration was used to prevent bystander FRET ( this was con - firmed by fluorescence lifetime measurements of mTurquoise2 ) . The cells were imaged 2 d after transfection . The mounting method and microscope setup have been described in “General” and “Photostability . ” An RFP and a CFP image were recorded sequentially with exci - tation power 0 . 053 – 0 . 11 W cm −2 and 0 . 21 W cm −2 , respectively . ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Multiple positions ( 9 or 25 ) on the same coverslip were imaged ; care was taken to avoid pre - excitation . The red over cyan fluores - cence intensity ratio was determined per cell ( more than 800 cells per RFP variant ) . The RFP fluorescence intensities were corrected for the spectral differences per RFP variant ; for example , the RFP fluorescence intensities were divided with the relative absorbance at excitation wavelengths and the relative emission at emission filter wavelength . The median of the ratio was calcu - lated per variant , and the values were subsequently normalized to the ratio of mCherry . The normalized values of two experiments were averaged . For Supplementary Figure 5k an RFP – T2A – mTurquoise2 was compared with an mTurquoise2 – P2A – RFP , resulting in an RFP with or without additional polypeptides fused at the C and N terminus ( the RFP – T2A – mTurquoise2 plasmid was cloned in a similar fashion as was plasmid no . 60494 from Addgene ) . The samples were prepared and recorded as described above . The photochromic behavior can be a severe issue in quantitative assays . For Supplementary Figure 5l the same field of view of a sample with TagRFP - T was recorded four times ( sequentially red and cyan settings as described above ) . Maturation kinetics . U - 2 OS cells were seeded in an Ibitreat µ - plate 96 - well ( 89626 , Ibidi ) . After one night the culture medium was replaced by microscopy medium , and each well was trans - fected with 300 ng plasmid ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) and 1 µ g PEI in 20 µ l Opti - MEM . Directly after transfection the 96 - well plate was placed on the setup described in “Brightness in mam - malian cells . ” In this experiment the sample was kept at 37 °C . An RFP and a CFP image were acquired every 15 min for a total duration of 48 h . The timecourse of fluorescence intensity in individual cells was determined in background - corrected RFP and CFP images . Using ImageJ , regions of interest ( ROIs ) were carefully drawn around single cells or two cells that exhibited the same timecourse . Typically , cells only started to produce fluorescent proteins after cell division . The time trace was interactively checked for arti - facts . All ROIs were stored and processed in Matlab ; time traces were extracted by calculating the mean fluorescence intensity in the ROIs ; all curves were subsequently visually inspected , and the timepoint was determined where the signal in the CFP chan - nel surpassed the baseline . All curves were registered using these starting timepoints in order to synchronize the RFP and CFP time traces . Average curves were calculated for both the CFP and the RFP channels , and they were subsequently normalized to the fluorescence level at t = 16 h . Only traces that were 16 h or longer were used . For each average time trace a tangent line was deter - mined at the timepoint with the maximum slope . Subsequently , the time where the tangent line intersected the time - axis was cal - culated both for the CFP and RFP channels . This timepoint was used as a measure for apparent delay observed in the timecourse of the increase in CFP and RFP fluorescence . The difference in apparent delay between RFP and CFP was used as a comparative measure for maturation kinetics in mammalian cells . The time range used to calculate the tangent line at the maximal slope was adjusted for each RFP variant in order to make sure the average time trace comprised the inflection point . The exact number of curves used to estimate the tangent line and maturation delay were : mScarlet , n = 28 ; mScarlet - I , n = 26 ; mScarlet - H , n = 45 ; © 2 016 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e .

Davidson ( National High Magnetic Field Laboratory , Tallahasee , Florida , USA ) and was digested with AgeI and BsrGI to replace Emerald with SGFP2 , dTomato , mCherry , mApple , TagRFP - T , mKate2 , mRuby2 , mRuby3 , mScarlet , mScarlet - I or mScarlet - H . U - 2 OS cells were cultured and transfected as described in “General . ” 1 d after transfection , the samples were mounted as described in “General . ” Images were acquired on a spinning disk setup as described in “Photostability . ” In addition , the spinning disk setup was equipped with a 488 nm laser to excite GFP . For SGFP2 detection , the emission was filtered by a 500 nm longpass filter . The sig - nal was acquired by an iXon 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor ) or an ORCA - Flash4 . 0 V2 Digital CMOS camera ( C11440 - 22CU , Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Tilescans ( 5 × 5 ) with 4 – 8 times averag - ing were acquired using NIS - elements software ( Nikon ) . Cells were visually inspected and scored for correct ER struc - ture and localization . Cells that showed fragmented nuclei were excluded from the analysis . For better determination of OSER structures , dTomato was included as a positive control for dimeri - zation , and both SGFP2 and mCherry were included as negative controls as these are stated to be true monomers 22 . Cells with OSER structures , nuclear envelope ( NE ) thickening and / or incor - rect localization ( to other organelles ) were scored 0 . Cells with normal ER structure were scored 1 . The percentage of cells with normal looking ER was calculated per fluorescent protein variant . For a more accurate determination of the monomeric state , including a correction for total fluorescent protein production among cells , a ratio of intensities within a cell was measured 22 . The ratio of the mean intensity of the OSER structures over the mean of three NE regions was calculated . For checking possible Golgi localization of CytERM - fusions , the Giantin DNA coding sequence of FRB – ECFP ( W66A ) – Giantin ( 67903 , Addgene ) was cloned into pmTurquoise2 – C1 ( 60560 , Addgene ) using the restriction enzymes BsrGI and BamHI . U - 2 OS cells were cultured and cotransfected with 250 ng of mScarlet – CytERM - N - 17 or mRuby3 – CytERM - N - 17 or mRuby2 – CytERM - N - 17 and 250 ng of pmTurquoise2 – Giantin . 1 d after transfection , the samples were mounted as described in “General . ” Images were acquired on a spinning disk setup as described in “Photostability . ” mTurquoise2 was excited at 405 nm , and the cyan emission was filtered by a 435 – 490 nm bandpass filter ( FF02 - 447 / 60 , Semrock ) . Organelle localization . The Giantin DNA coding sequence of FRB – ECFP ( W66A ) – Giantin ( 67903 , Addgene ) was cloned in to pmScarlet – C1 , pmScarlet - I – C1 and pmScarlet - H – C1 using the restriction enzymes BsrGI and BamHI . The following constructs pLifeAct – mTurquoise2 ( 36201 , Addgene ) , pmTurquoise2 – Mito ( 36208 , Addgene ) , pmTurquoise2 – H2A ( 36207 , Addgene ) , pmTurquoise2 – Tubulin ( 36202 , Addgene ) , and pmTurquoise2 – Peroxi ( 36203 , Addgene ) were digested with AgeI and BsrGI to exchange mTurquoise2 for mScarlet , mScarlet - I or mScarlet - H . Cells were seeded as described in “General . ” For Golgi apparatus and the peroxisomes labeling , U - 2 OS cells were transfected with 200 – 500 ng plasmid and 1 µ l Lipofectamine 2000 ( 11668027 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in order to obtain a moderate protein production . For F - actin , nuclei and mitochondria labeling the protein production level is less critical ; for these samples U - 2 OS cells were transfected with 200 – 500 ng plasmid and 4 . 5 µ g PEI . For visualization of microtubules , HeLa cells ( CCL - 2 , ATCC ) were transfected with 200 – 500 ng plasmid and 4 . 5 µ g PEI . 1 d after transfection , all samples were mounted and imaged as described in the OSER assay section . Cytotoxicity in HeLa cells . The RFP – C1 plasmids as described in “General” were used for transfection . FusionRed ( FP433 , Evrogen ) was cloned into pEGFP – C1 ( Clontech ) by using AgeI and BspEI restriction sites . HeLa cells ( CCL - 2 , ATCC ) were cultured in T25 flasks . On day 0 , they were transiently transfected with 4 µ g expression vectors coding for the indicated RFP variants , EGFP as noncytotoxic control , or an empty C1 cloning vector as negative control . The cells were passaged on days 2 and 4 . On days 2 and 6 , the percentage of fluorescent cells was analyzed on a cell sorter ( BD FACSAria III , BD Biosciences ) using a 100 µ m nozzle at 20 psi with a flow rate of 1 . 0 . Prior to acquisition , cell pellets were washed with HBSS ( 14175129 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) containing 2 % fetal bovine serum ( 10270106 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and 1 µ g ml −1 DAPI ( D1306 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) to exclude dead cells from the analysis and resuspended in HBSS containing 2 % fetal bovine serum . At least 30 , 000 viable cells per sample were recorded . RFPs were excited with a 561 nm laser , and fluorescence emission was filtered with either a 582 / 15 nm bandpass filter ( for detecting mScarlet , mScarlet - I , mScarlet - H , mRuby3 , mRuby2 , TagRFP - T , mApple and dTomato ) or a 610 / 20 nm band - pass filter ( for detecting FusionRed , mKate2 and mCherry ) . DAPI and EGFP were measured using a 405 nm laser with a 450 / 50 nm bandpass emission filter and a 488 nm laser with a 530 / 30 nm bandpass emission filter , respectively . Raw data were analyzed with FlowJo v 10 . 1 ( FlowJo , LLC ) . The percentage of living fluorescent cells was determined for each timepoint . The percentage of positive cells at day 6 relative to the percentage at day 2 was normalized to EGFP . Three independent experiments from transfections on three different days are shown in Supplementary Figure 14 . FLIM unmixing . Construct pmScarlet – H2A was used as described in “Photostability . ” mScarlet - H was C - terminus fused to the nuclear export sequence ( NES , SELQNKLEELDLDSYK 37 ) . Cells were seeded as described in “General . ” The cells were cotransfected with 200 – 400 ng of each plasmid ( pmScarlet – H2A and pmScarlet - H – NES ) and 4 . 5 µ g PEI . The control cells were transfected with 300 – 600 ng plasmid ( pmScarlet – H2A or pmScarlet - H – NES ) and 4 . 5 µ g PEI . 1 d after transfection , the sample was mounted as described in “General . ” The sample was placed on an Eclipse Ti - E ( Nikon ) equipped with a LIFA system ( Multi - Led illumination and LI 2 CAM ; Lambert Instruments ) . The modulated 532 nm LED excitation light passed through a 534 / 20 excitation filter ( FF01 - 534 / 20 , Semrock ) and was directed to the sample by a 577 nm dichroic mirror ( Di02 - R561 , Semrock ) and focused using a 60× CFI Plan Apochromat NA 1 . 4 oil objective ( MDR01605 , Nikon ) . The emission was filtered by a 609 / 54 nm © 2 016 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4074 nature methods emission bandpass ( FF01 - 609 / 54 , Semrock ) . The LI - FLIM software ( Lambert Instruments ) recorded 18 phase steps ( with three times averaging ) in pseudorandom order at a frequency of f = 40 MHz . Erythrosin B ( 198269 , Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in ddH 2 O was used as reference dye ( fluorescence lifetime 0 . 086 ns ; ten times averaging for reference stack ) . t j and t M images were calculated by the LI - FLIM software . Two - component fluorescence lifetime unmixing was per - formed as previously described 19 , 37 . In frequency domain FLIM , two average fluorescence lifetimes can be obtained from the phase shift ( ) j and from the demodulation ( M ) of the fluorescence emission relative to the excitation light ( t j and t M , respectively ) according to equation ( 5 ) , in which ω is the angular frequency of modulation ( = 2 π f ) : G M S M S G M S G = =   = = + −      cos sin j j w t w and t j 1 1 1 2 2 1 5 ( ) From the phase and modulation lifetimes the polar coordinates G and S can be calculated in the polar plot or phasor plot using the following equation : G S G M = + +  = 1 1 1 6 2 2 2 2 ( ) ( ) ( ) w t w t w t j j In case a fluorophore exhibits multiexponential decay with n sin - gle exponentially decaying components of which the i th compo - nent has a lifetime t i and a fractional contribution to the steady state fluorescence α i , then in the frequency domain the fluores - cence decay can be represented by a single coordinate ( G , S ) in the polar plot as follows : G S i i i n i i i i n = + = +      = = ∑ ∑ a w t a wt w t 1 1 7 2 2 1 2 2 1 ( ) Equation ( 7 ) is linear with respect to the fractional steady - state contributions α i . Consequently , the coordinate in the polar plot of a mixture of two fluorophores ( one with polar coordi - nates ( G 1 , S 1 ) and the other with polar coordinates ( G 2 , S 2 ) ) can be described by : G f G f G S f S f S = + = +  1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 8 ( ) In equation ( 8 ) , f 1 and f 2 are the fractional contributions of fluoro - phores 1 and 2 to the total steady - state fluorescence with f 2 = 1 – f 1 . In the polar or phasor plot , the coordinates of the mixture ( G , S ) therefore lie on the line connecting the polar coordinates of the individual fluorophores ( G 1 , S 1 ) and ( G 2 , S 2 ) , and f 1 is the relative distance from ( G , S ) to ( G 2 , S 2 ) as compared to the distance from ( G 1 , S 1 ) to ( G 2 , S 2 ) . ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) For two - component lifetime unmixing , the single - pixel ( G , S ) coordinates were first projected perpendicularly on the line connecting ( G 1 , S 1 ) and ( G 2 , S 2 ) ; and , subsequently , the fractions f 1 and f 2 were calculated . These fractions multiplied by the DC steady - state fluorescence image yielded the unmixed component images . The polar coordinates ( G , S ) for the individual fluoro - phores were calculated with equation ( 6 ) using single - fluoro - phore t j and t M lifetime values measured in triplicate from single transfected cells with exactly the same FLIM settings . For mScarlet - H – NES , t j = 1 . 179 ± 0 . 017 ns and t M = 1 . 353 ± 0 . 014 ns ; for H2A – mScarlet , t j = 3 . 521 ± 0 . 016 ns and t M = 3 . 642 ± 0 . 022 ns . Ratiometric FRET analysis . The RFPs were fused to YPet 38 , this latter sequence was derived from pPBbsr2 - Raichu - 2247× and was a kind gift of M . Matsuda ( Laboratory of Bioimaging and Cell Signaling , Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan ) . To ensure equal linker length from the last amino acid from the beta - barrel of the RFP until the M1 of YPet , the linker had a different length for mRuby2 ( SGLRSRAQNSAVDGT , 15 aa ) as for the other RFPs used ( SGLRSRAQASNSAVDGT , 17 aa ) . Cells were seeded as described in “General . ” The cells were cotransfected with 4 . 5 µ g PEI , 450 ng carrier DNA ( empty cloning vector ) and 17 . 5 ng plas - mid ( RFP – YFP fusion ) . To measure direct excitation of the RFP at the donor excitation wavelength and the shape of the acceptor and donor spectrum , cells were transfected with acceptor or donor only ( 4 . 5 µ g PEI , 450 ng carrier DNA and 17 . 5 ng pRFP – C1 or pYPet – C1 ) . The low plasmid concentration was used to prevent bystander FRET ( this was confirmed by fluorescence lifetime measurements of YPet in a similar P2A construct ) . The cells were imaged 2 d after transfection . The samples were mounted as described in “General . ” The spectral imaging setup was previously described 39 and was equipped with a Plan Neofluar 20× air objective ( Zeiss ) . First , cells were selected in an unbiased manner toward acceptor matura - tion by using donor microscope settings , hence 500 / 20 nm for excitation ( HQ500 / 20 , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) , a 528 dichroic mirror ( 525dcxr , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) , and a 542 / 27 nm emission filter ( FF01 - 542 / 27 , Semrock ) . The sensitized spectrum was captured using 500 / 20 nm excita - tion filter , an 80 / 20 beam splitter ( 20 / 80bs , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) , and a 530 longpass emission filter ( # 46 - 059 , Edmund optics worldwide ) . Immediately after , an acceptor - only image was recorded to correct for protein production , using a 577 / 20 nm excitation bandpass filter ( D577 / 20 , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) , a 596 nm dichroic mirror ( 600dcxr , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) , and a 630 / 60 nm emission filter ( HQ630 / 60 , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) . For each variant at least 37 cells were imaged and analyzed . Briefly , two spectral images were acquired ; one was acquired using donor excitation with the longpass filter , and subsequently one was acquired using acceptor excitation with the bandpass filter . Cells were selected semiautomatically using a custom - made Matlab script , and the spectrum obtained with donor excitation settings was normalized with the peak intensity of the spectrum measured using acceptor excitation settings . Using these micro - scope settings , the donor was not excited with acceptor excitation light ; however , the acceptor was directly excited when using the donor excitation settings . Spectra of the samples that contained © 2 016 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4074 nature methods both donor and acceptor were unmixed using linear regression with the spectra measured in cells expressing donor only and acceptor only , and all spectra from the samples were averaged over multiple cells . The amount of direct acceptor excitation was estimated from normalized spectra measured in cells expressing acceptor only . The wavelength axis and spectral sensitivity ( tail of longpass filter and camera ) were corrected in order to obtain calibrated spectra . Finally , for each mRFP variant , the spectra were normalized with respect to the donor peak at 527 nm . Single - chain FRET sensor for RhoA activity . In the DORA - RhoA sensor - wt biosensor ( a kind gift from Y . Wu 23 ( Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling , University of Connecticut Health Center , Farmington , USA ) ) the donor ( mCerulean3 ) was replaced by SGFP2 using BamHI and NheI restriction sites . The SGFP2 insert for this color swap was obtained by performing PCR on a Clontech - style pSGFP2 – C1 ( 22881 , Addgene ) using RhoA prim - ers set 1 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , thereby introducing BamHI and NheI restriction sites before and after the SGFP2 , respectively . Next , the acceptor ( cpVenus6 ) was replaced by either mCherry or mScarlet - I in a two - step process . First , a BglII restriction site was introduced into the sensor plasmid , behind the acceptor FP sequence , and simultaneously the original acceptor was swapped for mNeonGreen ( a kind gift from N . Shaner 40 ( The Scintillon Institute , San Diego , California , USA ) ) via overlap - extension PCR 41 . The first PCRs were performed on the Clontech - style C1 plasmid containing mNeonGreen using RhoA primers set 2 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and on the RhoA sensor plasmid using RhoA primers set 3 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The second PCR was performed on a mix of both PCR products using RhoA primers set 2 FW and RhoA primers set 3 RV . The resulting PCR product and the RhoA sensor are digested with AgeI and HindIII , and the PCR product containing the BglII restriction site and mNeonGreen is ligated into the sensor . Second , mNeon - Green was replaced by mCherry or mScarlet - I using AgeI and BglII restriction sites . The mCherry and mScarlet - I inserts for this color swap were obtained by performing PCR on a clontech - style pmCherry – C1 and pmScarlet - I – C1 using RhoA primers set 4 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . To create the constitutive active forms of the GR - RhoA sensor ( ca - GR - RhoA sensor ) containing SGFP2 and mCherry – mScarlet - I , the part containing the consti - tutive activating Q63L mutation from the DORA - RhoA sensor - ca ( a kind gift from Y . Wu 23 ) was introduced using HindIII and NheI restriction sites . Response curves . HeLa cells were seeded as described in “General . ” The cells were transfected with 500 ng plasmid encod - ing wtGR – RhoA sensor and 500 ng plasmid untagged H1R recep - tor ( HRH0100000 , cDNA ) . For bleedthrough controls , cells were transfected with 500 ng pSGFP2 – C1 ( 22881 , Addgene ) , pmCherry – C1 or pmScarlet - I – C1 . 1 d after transfection the sam - ples were mounted as described in “General” and were placed on a widefield fluorescence microscope described by van Unen et al . 23 . A timeseries with three sequential images ( donor excita - tion – donor emission ( D ) , donor excitation – acceptor emission ( S ) , acceptor excitation – acceptor emission ( A ) ) was recorded using an oil - immersion objective ( Plan - Neo - fluor 40 × / 1 . 30 ; C . Zeiss , GmbH ) at 37 °C . The time interval in the timeseries was 4 . 4 s , and the image size was 348 × 260 pixels with pixel size of 340 nm . The donor was excited at 480 / 10 nm . The excitation light passed through a 375 – 490 nm ( e490sp , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) excitation filter and was reflected by a 490 nm dichroic mirror ( 490dcxr , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) . The donor emission was filtered by a 500 nm longpass filter ( HQ500LP , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) and a 525 / 40 nm bandpass ( BP525 / 40 , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) . The acceptor emission was filtered by a 600 / 37 nm bandpass ( FF01 - 600 / 37 , Semrock ) . The acceptor was excited at 545 / 10 nm , the excitation light passed a 375 – 580 nm excitation filter ( e580sp , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) and was reflected on the sam - ple by a 591 nm dichroic mirror ( 585dcxr , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) . The acceptor emission was filtered by a 593 nm longpass ( E590lpv2 , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) in com - bination with a 600 / 37 nm bandpass ( FF01 - 600 / 37 , Semrock ) . Cells were stimulated with 100 µ M histamine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 10 µ M mepyramine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . In order to extract the pure donor emission and sensitized emission , filter FRET coefficients were determined from cells expressing donor only and acceptor only ; the same microscope settings were used for these measurements . The bleedthrough of the donor in the acceptor emission channel ( β ) , the bleedthrough of the acceptor in the donor channel ( δ ) and the direct excitation of the acceptor with donor excitation light ( γ ) were determined 42 . The background intensity of each image in the timeseries was calculated using a hand - drawn region of interest , and it was sub - sequently subtracted . The background images were stored in an ImageJ tif hyperstack containing the three channels ( D , S and A ) . Before applying the filter FRET calculations , the images with sensitized emission ( S ) were registered to the images with donor emission ( D ) using the Lucas – Kanade algorithm . The images with direct acceptor emission ( A ) were registered to the regis - tered sensitized emission images ( S ) . Filter FRET was applied , and the resulting corrected images were stored in a separate ImageJ tif hyperstack . Regions of interest were drawn around cells using ImageJ , and the time traces of the mean intensity for all channels were extracted . The ratio of the pure sensitized emission and pure donor emission was calculated and baseline subtracted . The latter retains the effect of the quantum yield on the amplitude of the FRET ratio change . Sharp spikes due to pipetting or other causes in the time traces were removed with the aid of a median filter algorithm . The 95 % confidence interval of the mean response curve was calculated using statistical bootstrapping . FRET spectra . HeLa cells were seeded as described in “General” and transfected with 500 ng plasmid encoding wtGR – RhoA or caGR – RhoA sensors . For unmixing controls cells were transfected with 500 ng pSGFP2 – C1 ( 22881 , Addgene ) , pmCherry – C1 or pmScarlet - I – C1 . 1 d after transfection the sample was mounted as described in “General . ” The spectra were recorded on a widefield spectral imaging microscope as described in “Ratiometric FRET analysis” in a similar manner . Only here , the donor was excited by using a 436 / 20 nm excitation filter ( D436 / 20 , Chroma Technology Incorporation ) , and the emission was filtered by a 458 nm long - pass ( BLP01 - 458R , Semrock ) . The same analysis was applied as described in “Ratiometric FRET analysis . ” Multimeric ratiometric FRET biosensor . An intermolecu - lar ratiometric FRET biosensor was created that contains PH – PLC δ 1 – RFP and SYFP2 – PH – PLC δ 1 produced in a three - to - one ratio due to an IRES sequence . The PH – PLC δ 1 encoding sequence © 2 016 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . , p a r t o f S p r i ng e r N a t u r e . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4074 nature methods was derived from plasmid PH – PLCD1 – GFP 43 ( 51407 , Addgene ) and was a gift from T . Balla ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . The IRES - encoding sequence was obtained from G β 2A – cpV – G γ 2 – IRES – G α i3 – mTq2 ( 69625 , Addgene ) . The cells were cultured as described in “General . ” U - 2 OS cells were trans - fected with 300 ng carrier DNA ( empty cloning vector ) , 100 ng untagged H1R receptor ( HRH0100000 , cDNA ) and 100 ng of the biosensor plasmid . Acceptor comparison . 2 d after transfection , the sample was mounted as described in “General” and was stimulated with histamine to a final concentration of 0 . 1 mM . A timeseries of images was acquired on an Olympus FV1000 confocal micro - scope equipped with a 488 nm laser ( LDH - P - C - 485 , PicoQuant ) . The excitation light was directed via a 488 dichroic mirror ( Di01 - R405 / 488 / 561 / 635 , Semrock ) and focused by a 10× UPLSApo NA 0 . 4 air objective ( Olympus ) . The donor signal was collected with an open pinhole and filtered using a 525 – 555 nm bandpass filter ( Chroma Technology Incorporation ) . The acceptor signal was filtered by a 610 – 710 nm bandpass filter ( Chroma Technology Incorporation ) . The images in both channels were background corrected , and an upper threshold of 4 , 000 counts was applied such that pixels associated with background and pixels associated with cells pro - ducing extremely high amounts of protein were excluded . For each timepoint the mean intensity was calculated for both the RFP and the YFP channel . Time traces from three different measure - ments were averaged , and the baseline was subtracted ( Fig . 2j ) . Ratiometric FRET video with mScarlet - I as acceptor . 1 d after transfection , the sample was mounted as described in “General” and was stimulated with histamine to a final concentration of 0 . 1 mM . The sample was placed on an Eclipse Ti - E ( Nikon ) equipped with a 513 nm LED ( SpectraX , Lumencor ) . The excita - tion light passed through a 510 / 24 bandpass and was directed via a triple - band cube ( blue , teal , yellow ; MXU74157 , Nikon ) and focused by a CFI Plan Apochromat K 60× NA 1 . 4 ( Nikon ) objective in the sample . The donor emission was filtered with a 550 / 49 nm bandpass ( FF01 - 550 / 49 , Semrock ) , and the acceptor emission was filtered with a 593 / 46 nm bandpass ( FF01 - 593 / 46 , Semrock ) . The optical filters were moved by an optical filter changer ( Lambda 10 - B , Sutter instrument ) . The donor and accep - tor emission were sequentially recorded by an ORCA - Flash4 . 0 V2 Digital CMOS camera ( C11440 - 22CU , Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Images of 2 , 048 × 2 , 044 pixels , with a pixel size of 108 nm , were taken every 1 . 6 s . The cells were stimulated with histamine ( 0 . 1 mM ) in order to activate PLC . Each frame in both the RFP and YFP channels was background corrected , and the channels were registered using the Lucas – Kanade algorithm to remove any spectral shift between the chan - nels . Images were subsequently smoothed with a 5 × 5 box filter , and the ratio image of acceptor over donor intensity was calculated . A mask was applied to the ratio image in order to remove back - ground . The mask treshold was based on a smoothed intensity image . The ratio was visualized using the Fire false color LUT , and an overlay image was created combining the smoothed intensity image and the false color - coded image associated with the FRET ratio . Statistical methods . Data were analyzed according to the methods described in the sections above . In case an analysis was based on multiple individual cells , the data from any cell showing possible signs of dying ( e . g . , rounding up ) were excluded . The resulting parameter values ( e . g . , mean or median ) are presented with their 95 % confidence intervals , except for the time - domain fluorescence lifetimes for which the s . e . m . was reported . For the cytotoxicity data mean values and individual data points are presented . In order to make sure the results were repeatable and consistent , the experimental design for each type of experiment was systemati - cally optimized . Analysis was performed on results obtained from optimal experiments , and confidence intervals were calculated and evaluated ; if necessary , sample size was increased in order to obtain more accurate estimates . Error propagation was used in the case of composite parameters that were calculated based on two or more measured parameters , especially in the case of the normalization of parameters with respect to a reference RFP ( e . g . , mCherry standard ) . Confidence intervals were calculated using the estimated standard error of the parameter , the inverse Student ′ s t - distribution , which included the number of degrees of freedom . For the mean values the degrees of freedom was the sample size minus one , and for composite parameters with error propagation the generalized Welch – Satterthwaite equation was used for calculating the degrees of freedom . Statistical bootstrap - ping applied to average maturation curves was used to calculate the confidence intervals for the maturation delay times . Boxplots where generated using BoxPlotR ( http : / / boxplot . tyerslab . com / ) 44 , which includes the median values , the individual data points and the 95 % confidence intervals ( notches ) .

NATURE METHODS Corrigendum : mScarlet : a bright monomeric red fluorescent protein for cellular imaging Daphne S Bindels , Lindsay Haarbosch , Laura van Weeren , Marten Postma , Katrin E Wiese , Marieke Mastop , Sylvain Aumonier , Guillaume Gotthard , Antoine Royant , Mark A Hink & Theodorus W J Gadella Jr Nat . Methods doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4074 ; corrected online 12 December 2016 In the version of this article initially published online , the last sentence of the abstract was incorrect ; it should read “mScarlet outperforms existing red fluorescent proteins as a fusion tag , and it is especially useful as a Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) acceptor in ratiomet - ric imaging . ” In addition , the third author affiliation was incorrect ; it should read " Institut de Biologie Structurale , Université Grenoble Alpes , CNRS , CEA , Grenoble , F - 38044 , France . ” Table 1 contained three errors : the symbol for fluorescence lifetime ( column 6 ) was incorrect ; the unit for column 7 was τ , and it should be p K a f . Finally , Equation 6 in the Online Methods was written incorrectly , with the denominator included within the square root . These errors have been corrected for the print , PDF , and HTML versions of this article . CORRIGENDA
