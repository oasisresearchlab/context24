Persons sharing a dwelling with someone who has COVID - 19 have a substantial 3 risk of being exposed to the virus . However , environmental monitoring for the detection of virus 4 in such settings is limited . We present a pilot study on environmental sampling for SARS - CoV - 2 5 virions in the residential rooms of two volunteers with COVID - 19 who self - quarantined . Apart 6 from standard surface swab sampling , based on availability , four air samplers positioned 0 . 3 - 2 . 2 7 m from the volunteers were used : a VIable Virus Aerosol Sampler ( VIVAS ) , an inline air 8 sampler that traps particles on polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) filters , a NIOSH 2 - stage cyclone 9 sampler ( BC - 251 ) , and a Sioutas personal cascade impactor sampler ( PCIS ) . The latter two 10 selectively collect particles of specific size ranges . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected by real - time 11 Reverse - Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction ( rRT - qPCR ) analyses of particles 12 in one air sample from the room of volunteer A and in various air and surface samples from that 13 of volunteer B . The one positive sample collected by the NIOSH sampler from volunteer A’s 14 room had a quantitation cycle ( Cq ) of 38 . 21 for the N - gene , indicating a low amount of airborne 15 virus [ 5 . 69E - 02 SARS - CoV - 2 genome equivalents ( GE ) / cm 3 of air ] . In contrast , air samples and 16 surface samples collected off the mobile phone in volunteer B’s room yielded Cq values ranging 17 from 14 . 58 to 24 . 73 and 21 . 01 to 24 . 74 , respectively , on the first day of sampling , indicating that 18 this volunteer was actively shedding relatively high amounts of SARS - CoV - 2 at that time . The 19 SARS - CoV - 2 GE / cm 3 of air for the air samples collected by the PCIS was in the range 6 . 84E + 04 20 to 3 . 04E + 05 using the LED - N primer system , the highest being from the stage 4 filter , and 21 similarly , ranged from 2 . 54E + 03 to 1 . 68E + 05 GE / cm 3 in air collected by the NIOSH sampler . 22 Attempts to isolate the virus in cell culture from the samples from volunteer B’s room with the 23 aforementioned Cq values were unsuccessful due to out - competition by a co - infecting Human 24 adenovirus B3 ( HAdVB3 ) that killed the Vero E6 cell cultures within 4 days of their inoculation , 25 although Cq values of 34 . 56 - 37 . 32 were measured upon rRT - qPCR analyses of vRNA purified 26 from the cell culture medium . The size distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 - laden aerosol particles 27 collected from the air of volunteer B’s room was > 0 . 25 µm and > 0 . 1 µm as recorded by the PCIS 28 and the NIOSH sampler , respectively , suggesting a risk of aerosol transmission since these 29 particles can remain suspended in air for an extended time and travel over long distances . The 30 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f detection of virus in surface samples also underscores the potential for fomite transmission of 1 SARS - CoV - 2 in indoor settings . 2 Keywords : Self - isolation rooms ; Residential setting ; Size - fractionated aerosols ; Aerosol 3 transmission ; Human adenovirus B3 4 1 . Introduction 5 Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the coronavirus 6 disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic has resulted in more than 191 million cases and over 4 . 1 7 million deaths as of July 22 , 2021 ( WHO , 2021 ) . To contain the spread of the virus , it is critical 8 to understand how the virus is transmitted from person to person . Current epidemiological 9 evidence suggests SARS - CoV - 2 is spread among people by two main routes of infection : ( a ) 10 direct or indirect contact of a recipient with virus - laden coughed or sneezed droplets produced by 11 a COVID - 19 patient situated nearby , and ( b ) inhalation of aerosol particles containing the virus . 12 Aerosol transmission of infectious microorganisms can occur when they are inhaled in the form 13 of droplet nuclei or small particles bearing these agents in aerosols . By definition , aerosols are 14 colloidal suspensions of small solid or liquid particles suspended in air or another gas . As a result 15 of their small sizes , particles in aerosols can remain suspended in air for prolonged times and 16 travel long distances from the emitting source ( Pan et al . , 2019 ) . The World Health Organization 17 ( WHO ) originally stated that airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 might occur during aerosol 18 generating procedures such as tracheal intubation , non - invasive ventilation , tracheotomy , 19 cardiopulmonary resuscitation , bronchoscopy , sputum induction , and dentistry and autopsy 20 procedures ( WHO , 2020a ) . Since these procedures are carried out in hospital settings and due to 21 the exposure risk for healthcare personnel attending to COVID - 19 patients , previous studies 22 wherein infectious virus was isolated , were focused on COVID - 19 patient isolation rooms in 23 hospital settings ( Ahn et al . , 2020 ; Lednicky et al . , 2020a ; Santarpia et al . , 2020 ) . Airborne 24 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 outside of healthcare facilities , particularly in indoor settings 25 and / or in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces requires further study ( WHO , 2020b ) since 26 infectious microorganisms in small droplets or droplet nuclei in aerosols can linger in air within 27 closed , air - conditioned spaces , for several hours ( Carbone et al . , 2021 ) . Additionally , 28 superspreading events are reported to have occurred in such settings ( Lewis , 2021 ) . With stay - at - 29 home orders issued across the world and most of the infected individuals advised to self - isolate 30 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f unless they require medical attention , household transmission becomes a concern . Moreover , in 1 contrast to the isolation rooms in hospitals , residential settings do not have negative pressure 2 isolation rooms , and disinfection processes differ between these two settings . 3 Based on epidemiological investigations and contact tracing , airborne transmission of 4 SARS - CoV - 2 has been reported among household contacts ( Hwang et al . , 2021 ; Lewis et al . , 5 2020 ; Wu et al . , 2020 ) . The secondary infection rate increases in such settings ( Grijalva et al . , 6 2020 , Qian et al . , 2020 ) , implicating household transmissions as a major source of new infections 7 ( Metlay et al . , 2021 ) . In a residential setting , people share common spaces and are hence prone to 8 substantial risk of infection while residing with SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals ( Fung et al . , 9 2020 ) . Monitoring the environments of individuals who self - isolate or quarantine in their 10 residences is important for assessing the risk of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 for other inhabitants 11 of the same domiciles . According to an environmental sampling conducted by Maestre et al . , 12 ( 2021 ) , detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in samples collected from the surface of a carpet in a 13 room unused by self - isolating COVID - 19 individuals suggests the dispersal and deposition of 14 virus - laden aerosols shed by the infected individuals . In another study monitoring the household 15 of quarantining individuals with COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in samples 16 collected from surfaces and wastewater , but not in the air samples ( Döhla et al . , 2020 ) . Because 17 the authors used only one type of sampler ( Coriolis micro , based on cyclonic technology ) to 18 collect airborne particles , they recommended the use of different air samplers to exclude method - 19 related false negative results . In both the studies mentioned above ( Döhla et al . , 2020 ; Maestre et 20 al . , 2021 ) , environmental monitoring of the households of quarantining individuals with COVID - 21 19 detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA but did not prove the infectivity of the virus . Demonstration that 22 the sampled SARS - CoV - 2 is infectious is exceptionally important : non - infectious SARS - CoV - 2 23 cannot cause COVID - 19 , and thus detection alone does not equate with inhalation risk . Thus , 24 current literature reveals a need for studies in residential settings to : ( 1 ) determine if self - 25 isolating individuals with varying degrees of symptoms shed infectious virus as people with 26 severe COVID - 19 symptoms are considered to have high viral load and a long period of virus 27 shedding ( Liu et al . , 2020a ) ; and ( 2 ) ascertain the size range of virus - laden particles shed by such 28 infected individuals . The latter is important because large droplets can be deposited onto surfaces 29 in close proximity to the infected individual while smaller droplets and droplet nuclei can remain 30 suspended in air for a long time in most indoor settings ( Fennelly , 2020 ; Pan et al . , 2019 ) . 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f In this pilot study , we collected ( 1 ) the entirety of airborne particles ( without size 1 classification ) using polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) filters and a VIable Virus Aerosol Sampler 2 ( VIVAS ) , ( 2 ) size - fractionated particles in aerosols according to aerodynamic size using a 2 - 3 stage cyclone aerosol sampler ( NIOSH bioaerosol sampler , BC - 251 ) and a Sioutas personal 4 cascade impactor sampler ( PCIS ) , and ( 3 ) high - touch surface swab samples in the residential 5 rooms of two self - isolating individuals with COVID - 19 . We report that SARS - CoV - 2 was 6 present in some of the samples collected from the air and surface samples in the rooms of the 7 volunteers . 8 9 2 . Methods 10 This work was IRB exempt as it does not involve research with human subjects or collect 11 information that may reveal the identity of the volunteers . Informed consent was obtained from 12 the volunteers to position the air samplers in their rooms and to collect surface samples from 13 frequently touched areas . 14 15 2 . 1 Sampling sites 16 The bedrooms of two 20 - year - old persons with symptomatic COVID - 19 were sampled 17 during their self - isolation periods within their apartments . After their diagnoses , both persons 18 volunteered to have their rooms tested for the virus through environmental sampling . Volunteer 19 A resided in a single - occupancy room ( 3 . 05 m×3 . 35 m ) of a 4 bedroom - 4 bath apartment , while 20 volunteer B resided in a single - occupancy room ( 4 . 69 m×2 . 96 m ) of a 2 bedroom - 1 bath 21 apartment . The air conditioners were set at 24 °C and 23 °C in volunteer A’s and B’s apartments , 22 respectively . The relative humidity in the rooms was not measured in this study . 23 24 2 . 2 Case descriptions 25 Volunteer A was asymptomatic when a nasopharyngeal ( NP ) swab specimen was 26 collected for a SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR test on 09 / 17 / 2020 and was notified the test was positive 27 the next day . The individual self - reported that symptoms were not apparent until 09 / 20 / 2020 , 28 when loss of sense of smell occurred and minor , nonproductive cough developed . A follow - up 29 rRT - qPCR test on 09 / 29 / 2020 was negative , yet this person continued to endure a minor cough 30 and a dull headache until 10 / 09 / 2020 . 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Starting 09 / 24 / 2020 , volunteer B experienced symptoms of COVID - 19 including 1 breathlessness , chills , fever , headache , loss of appetite , mild cough , nausea , sore throat , 2 tiredness , and whole - body ache . A NP swab was collected for a SARS - CoV - 2 rRT - qPCR test on 3 09 / 27 / 2020 , and the volunteer was informed the result was positive on 09 / 30 / 2020 . This 4 individual experienced persistent headaches and tiredness until 10 / 11 / 2020 , when another NP 5 sample was taken , which tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 . 6 7 2 . 3 Samplers 8 At each testing interval , air samplers were set at fixed points in the rooms with their air 9 inlets ~ 1 . 5 m from the ground , a height that approximates the distance from the ground to the 10 nose of a seated person . Air samplings were carried out in volunteer A’s room on 09 / 22 / 2020 , 11 09 / 23 / 2020 and 09 / 25 / 2020 with the PTFE filter , NIOSH bioaerosol sampler ( BC - 251 ) , and the 12 VIVAS . On 09 / 22 / 2020 , two samplers were set up in the bedroom – one at a distance of ~ 0 . 3 m 13 and the other ~ 1 . 8 m from volunteer A . The samplers were ~ 1 . 8 m away on 09 / 23 / 2020 and 14 09 / 25 / 2020 . Volunteer B was ~ 2 . 2 m away from the samplers on the days sampled ( 10 / 02 / 2020 15 and 10 / 06 / 2020 ) . A PCIS was used in place of the VIVAS in volunteer B’s room . The surfaces 16 of frequently touched areas as reported by the volunteers were swabbed with sterile nylon swabs . 17 The surfaces swabbed were on a mobile phone ( ~ 80 cm 2 ) , a laptop computer touch pad ( ~ 40 18 cm 2 ) , and the left elbow ( ~ 50 cm 2 ) of volunteer A , and a mobile phone ( ~ 80 cm 2 ) and room 19 doorknob ( ~ 16 . 8 cm 2 ) in volunteer B’s case . 20 PTFE filters ( 47 mm , 5 µm pore , LSWP04700 , Millipore Sigma , US ) placed in an inline 21 filter holder ( 47 mm , stainless steel , XX5004710 , Millipore Sigma , US or 47 mm , stainless steel , 22 Product ID : 2220 , Pall Corporation , US ) were run at 3 liter per minute ( LPM ) with Airchek 23 sampler pump ( Model 224 - PCXR4 , SKC Inc . , US ) or Escort ELF pump ( Item Number : 805560 , 24 Zefon International , US ) . This sampler collects all particles without size classification . The 2 - 25 stage cyclone aerosol sampler ( NIOSH bioaerosol sampler , BC - 251 ) developed by Lindsley et al . 26 ( 2006 ) was run at 3 LPM with Airchek PCXR4 pump . This sampler comprises of a 15 mL tube 27 ( Falcon conical centrifuge tubes , catalog no . 14 - 959 - 53A , Fisher Scientific , US ) , 1 . 5 mL 28 Eppendorf tube ( Microcentrifuge tubes , Fisher scientific , catalog no . 02 - 681 - 373 ) and a filter 29 cassette containing a PTFE filter ( 37 mm , 2 µm pore , catalog no . 225 - 1709 , SKC Inc . , US ) , 30 which collects particles of aerodynamic diameter > 4 . 4 µm , 1 . 1 - 4 . 4 µm and < 1 . 1 µm , 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f respectively . The calculation for cut - off size of each stage is described in the supplementary 1 material . 2 The VIVAS ( Aerosol Dynamics Inc . , US ) functions through a laminar air flow , water 3 vapor condensation mechanism , and has been proven to collect airborne SARS - CoV - 2 ( Lednicky 4 et al . , 2020a ; Lednicky et al . , 2020b ) . The operating principle and efficiency of this sampler in 5 collecting viruses has been documented elsewhere ( Lednicky et al . , 2016 ; Pan et al . , 2017 ) . 6 Briefly , as airborne particles are collected by the VIVAS , a shell of water molecules deposits 7 onto their surfaces , and that shell progressively enlarges through sequential water molecule 8 condensation as the particle travels along three distinct zones of the growth tubes inside the 9 VIVAS : viz . , conditioner ( 4 °C ) , initiator ( 40 °C ) , and moderator ( 31 °C ) . In this study , the 10 VIVAS was operated for 3 h at a flow rate of 8 LPM . The particles were subsequently collected 11 by gentle impaction onto 1 . 5 mL of sterile Virus Transport Medium ( VTM ) maintained at 25 °C 12 in a 35 mm Petri dish . The VTM used in an earlier study ( Lednicky et al . , 2020a ) was not used . 13 Instead , a different VTM that we have validated ( Lednicky , unpublished ) for coronaviruses that 14 we prepared and distributed for use in COVID - 19 diagnostic tests was used , as a large surplus 15 was available . The VTM used for this study was formulated with cryoprotectants in the form of 16 additional protein and sucrose to preserve infectivity of the virus . It is comprised of 1× brain 17 heart infusion broth ( Difco , US ) supplemented with 0 . 4 mg / mL neomycin sulfate ( Cell culture 18 grade , CAS Number : 1405 - 10 - 3 , Sigma Aldrich , US ) , 2 . 5 µg / mL gentamycin ( Cell culture , CAS 19 no . 1405 - 41 - 0 , Sigma Aldrich , US ) , 0 . 2 M sucrose ( Cell culture grade , CAS no . 57 - 50 - 1 , Sigma 20 Aldrich , US ) and 4 g / L of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) fraction V ( Lyophilized , Catalog no . 21 15260037 , Sigma Aldrich , US ) . 22 The PCIS ( catalog no . 225 - 370 , SKC Inc . , US ) was used with a Leland Legacy pump 23 ( catalog no . 100 - 3002 , SKC Inc . , US ) and operated at a flow rate of 9 L / min for 90 min . PTFE 24 filters ( 25 mm , 0 . 5 μm pore , catalog no . 225 - 2708 , SKC Inc . , US ) were used to collect particles 25 of size > 2 . 5 µm , 1 - 2 . 5 µm , 0 . 5 - 1 µm and 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 µm in the 4 collection stages . 37 mm PTFE 26 filters ( 2 μm pore , catalog no . 225 - 1709 , SKC Inc . , US ) were used for the 5 th stage , considered 27 the ‘after - filter’ stage ( SKC , 2021 ) . 28 Calibration of the pumps used for PTFE filters , NIOSH bioaerosol sampler and VIVAS 29 was performed with a Gilian Gilibrator - 2 NIOSH primary standard air flow calibrator 30 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f ( Sensidyne , US ) . The operating flow rate of PCIS was calibrated by a Defender Primary 1 Standard Calibrator ( catalog no . 717 - 510H , SKC Inc . , US ) . 2 3 2 . 4 Collection and processing of samples 4 The PCIS and NIOSH sampler were preloaded with filters / vials , their tubing connected to 5 the pump and sealed in sterile zip lock bags in a BSL2 laboratory . Similarly , 1 . 5 mL of sterile 6 collection medium was added to a Petri dish and sealed with parafilm . Sterile swabs and vials 7 containing virus transport medium for transport and storage of surface swab samples were 8 delivered along with the air samplers on a cart to the doorstep of the volunteer’s isolation room . 9 Thereafter , the volunteers moved the cart into the room , then positioned and turned on the air 10 sampling devices . After sampling intervals , the volunteers disinfected the surfaces of the cart , 11 sampling devices , zip lock bags , etc . , with 70 % ethanol before returning the surface - 12 decontaminated materials to the doorstep of the isolation rooms . The researchers again 13 disinfected the exterior of all the surfaces with 70 % ethanol and H 2 O 2 wipes when the cart was 14 outside the isolation room . All the sample containers and samplers were placed in secondary 15 polypropylene bags prior to transport to the laboratory . The volunteers wore gloves while 16 operating and returning the devices , and the researchers used N95 masks and gloves while 17 handling the devices and samples . The researchers did not have in - person contact with the 18 volunteers or their co - inhabitants . Positioning and operation of the samplers were pre - discussed 19 with the volunteers virtually . 20 The samples were processed and concentrated in a BSL - 2 + laboratory at the University 21 of Florida ( UF ) within 30 minutes of air sampling . After their removal from the sampler , 1 . 0 mL 22 and 0 . 5 mL of VTM were added to stages 1 and 2 tubes of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler , 23 respectively , while the after - filter was immersed in 5 mL of the medium . Swabs used for surface 24 samplings were immersed in 1 mL of the VTM . The filters from PCIS were individually 25 immersed in 1 mL of recovery solution [ 1×Phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) with 0 . 5 % w / v BSA 26 fraction V ] for 30 min at room temperature to rehydrate materials collected on their surfaces and 27 to help dislodge virions stuck on the filter surfaces ( Lednicky & Loeb , 2013 ) . The filters and 28 fluid were then transferred to a sterile 100 × 15 mm plastic Petri dish ( Fisher Scientific , Cat . No . 29 S33580A ) , and the filters scraped with flocked swabs pre - wetted with the recovery solution . The 30 residual fluid in each swab was extruded into the corresponding recovery solution . The solutions 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f were further concentrated by centrifugation in Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal filter units with 1 Ultracel - 100 membranes with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) at 2 4 , 000× g for 12 min , and the concentrates were adjusted to 400 µL by addition of recovery 3 solution . They were then aseptically transferred to sterile plastic cryotubes with silicone gaskets 4 ( Fisher Scientific , cat . No . 10 - 500 - 26 ) , and the tubes were thereafter transported in a Styrofoam 5 container with wet ice to a BSL2 - enhanced laboratory at UF’s Emerging Pathogens Institute 6 ( UF - EPI ) where they were stored in a locked - 80°C freezer until further analysis ( Dzung et al . , 7 2021 ; FDA , 2021 ) . 8 9 2 . 5 Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 genomic RNA ( vRNA ) 10 Virus genomic RNA ( vRNA ) for preliminary rRT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 screens was extracted 11 from thawed samples in a BSL2 - enhanced laboratory as described previously ( Lednicky et al . , 12 2020a , b ) . Briefly , vRNAs were purified using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , 13 CA , US ) and rRT - PCR tests were performed in a BioRad CFX96 Touch Real - Time PCR 14 detection system using the SARS - CoV - 2 N - gene detection primers and probe and rRT - qPCR 15 parameters described in Lednicky et al . ( 2020a , 2020b ) . The primers and probe for detection of 16 the virus’ RdRp gene ( Carbone et al . , 2021 ) are given in Table 1 and were used with the 17 following parameters : 400 nM final concentration of forward and reverse primers and 100 nM 18 final concentration of probe using SuperScript III One - Step RT - PCR system with Platinum Taq 19 DNA Polymerase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Cycling conditions were 20 minutes at 50 °C for 20 the reverse transcription step , followed by 2 minutes at 95 °C for the Taq polymerase activation 21 step , then 44 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 °C of denaturing , 30 seconds at 45 °C for annealing , and 22 20 seconds at 68 °C for extension . The Cq values were recorded from rRT - qPCR analysis . 23 24 2 . 6 Quantification of GE 25 SARS - CoV - 2 genome equivalents ( GE ) per cm 3 of air sampled was estimated from the Cq 26 values by the method described by Lednicky et al . ( 2020a ) . The process used to calculate 27 GE / cm 3 of air and GE / cm 3 of air per  log ( D p i . e . , particle diameter ) is described in the 28 supplementary information section . In this study , the lower size limit cannot be inferred for 29 NIOSH bioaerosol sampler since stage 3 of the sampler collects particles < 1 . 1 μm . Thus , the 30 lower limit of 0 . 1 μm based on the size of a SARS - CoV - 2 virion as evidenced by electron 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f microscopy of SARS - CoV - 2 cultured on Vero E6 cells ( e . g . , a median size of 100 nm shown in 1 Laue et al . ( 2021 ) ) was taken into consideration . While it is possible to detect SARS - CoV - 2 2 RNA in aerosol particles smaller than the size of a virion , such RNA is either incompletely 3 packaged virus genetic material or degraded virus RNA . This cannot be used as proof that 4 infectious virions are present . An upper limit of 10 μm for PCIS and NIOSH samplers as used 5 for graphing purposes ( Fig . 1 ) was adopted from prior studies ( Misra et al . 2002 ) . Since aerosol 6 particles can also deposit on surfaces , SARS - CoV - 2 GE that could be deposited on the sampled 7 surfaces during the sampling event was estimated from GE / cm 3 of air calculated for air samples . 8 As we did not measure the size distribution with a particle counter , we estimated this GE based 9 on the deposition velocity of the midpoint diameter of size range in each stage of PCIS and 10 NIOSH bioaerosol sampler ( supplementary information ) . The deposition velocities reported by 11 Hinds ( 1999 ) was used for the estimation ( values on Table S1 ) . 12 13 2 . 7 Sanger sequencing 14 Sanger sequencing was performed on vRNA extracted from the stage 4 filter of the PCIS , 15 since this sample had the lowest Cq value . A gene walking approach with non - overlapping 16 primers was used for sequencing ( Lednicky et al . , 2020b ) , details of which are provided in the 17 supplementary material . Briefly , cDNA produced using AccuScript high - fidelity reverse 18 transcriptase ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , US ) was amplified with Q5 polymerase 19 ( New England BioLabs , US ) and gene - specific primers . The 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome were 20 obtained using a Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends ( RACE ) kit ( Life Technologies , Inc . , 21 Carlsbad , CA , US ) . The sequences were assembled with Sequencher DNA sequence analysis 22 software version 2 . 1 ( Gene Codes , Ann Arbor , MI , US ) and the completed genome sequence , 23 designated as SARS - CoV - 2 UF - 30 , submitted to GenBank . 24 25 2 . 8 Isolation of virus in cell culture 26 For samples that tested positive by rRT - PCR , virus isolation was attempted in a BSL - 3 27 laboratory by analysts wearing powered - air purifying respirators . Vero E6 cells ( African green 28 monkey kidney cells , ATCC CRL - 1586 ) , procured from the American Type Culture Collection 29 ( ATCC ) , were used as the host cells . The cells were grown and maintained as monolayers and 30 were inoculated with aliquots of material collected at volunteer B’s room once they attained 80 % 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f confluence in T - 25 flasks room . Briefly , the samples that had been concentrated using 1 centrifugal filters were passed through sterile 0 . 45 - μm pore size PVDV syringe - tip filters to 2 remove large particulates and contaminating bacteria and fungi . The spent cell culture medium 3 was removed from the T25 flasks with Vero E6 cells and replaced with 1 mL of sterile cell 4 culture medium and 50 μL of the filtered samples , and the flasks with inoculated cells incubated 5 for 1 h at 37 °C . Following that , 2 mL of complete media was added to the flasks , which were 6 reincubated at 37 °C . The cells were periodically observed for cytopathic effects ( CPE ) . An 7 aliquot of the nucleic acids was also tested using a GenMarkDx multiplex PCR eSensor XT - 8 8 respiratory viral panel ( eSensor RVP ; GenMark Diagnostics , Inc . , Carlsbad , CA ) . The GenMark 9 sensor RVP detects the genomic material of common human respiratory viruses ( Pan et al . , 10 2017 ) . 11 12 3 . Results 13 Volunteer A developed mild COVID - 19 symptoms starting 09 / 21 / 2020 , which was 4 14 days after a positive NP swab test . All the air and surface samples collected from volunteer A’s 15 room on 09 / 22 / 2020 and 09 / 23 / 2020 were rRT - qPCR negative for SARS - CoV - 2 vRNA . On 16 09 / 25 / 2020 , a Cq value of 38 . 21 was produced in a rRT - qPCR test of material collected by stage 17 1 of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler , revealing the presence of 5 . 69E - 02 SARS - CoV - 2 GE per 18 cm 3 of air ( Table 2 ) . 19 SARS - CoV - 2 vRNA was detected in the samples collected from volunteer B’s room on 20 10 / 02 / 2020 ( day 9 from onset of symptoms ) , for which the corresponding Cq values resulting 21 from rRT - qPCR analyses and SARS - CoV - 2 GE / cm 3 of air are presented in Table 3a . The 22 positive air samples included those from stages 1 - 4 of the PCIS and all the stages of the NIOSH 23 bioaerosol sampler , implying the size range of the aerosol particles containing SARS - CoV - 2 to 24 be > 0 . 25 µm and > 0 . 1 µm as recorded by respective samplers . From Table 3a , it is evident that 25 the highest concentration was recorded in stage 4 filter of the PCIS , i . e . , 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 µm with both 26 the primer sets used ( 3 . 04E + 05 GE / cm 3 of air for LED - N and 1 . 19E + 05 GE / cm 3 of air for LED - 27 RdRp ) and the lowest was from stage 2 , which collects 1 - 2 . 5 µm particles . The samples collected 28 from the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler were estimated to have 2 . 9E + 04 , 1 . 68E + 05 and 2 . 54E + 03 29 GE per cm 3 air in stages 1 , 2 and 3 respectively , for LED - N primers . The estimated SARS - CoV - 30 2 GE per cm 3 of air per  log ( D p ) for the samples collected at volunteer B’s room by PCIS and 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f NIOSH bioaerosol sampler on 10 / 02 / 2020 are presented in Fig . 1 . The Cq values of surface 1 samples were lower than the air samples , and the corresponding GE estimated from the front and 2 back screens of the volunteer’s mobile phone were 1 . 48E + 09 and 3 . 2E + 09 , respectively , for 3 LED - N primer system . 4 Among the air and surface samples collected from volunteer B’s room on 10 / 06 / 2020 5 ( day 13 from onset of symptoms ) , SARS - CoV - 2 was detected only in stage 2 of the NIOSH 6 bioaerosol sampler ( Table 3b ) . The GE corresponding to this sample was 1 . 62E - 01 per cm 3 air , 7 which is ~ 10 6 lower than that recorded on 10 / 02 / 2020 for stage 2 of the NIOSH sampler . Even 8 after 14 days of inoculation onto Vero E6 cells , CPE were not observed , suggesting the absence 9 of infectious SARS - CoV - 2 in the sample collected on 10 / 06 / 2020 . This was confirmed by rRT - 10 qPCR tests of the cell culture media that were performed 7 - and 14 - days post - inoculation of the 11 cells . 12 The GE estimated for surface samples collected from volunteer B’s mobile phone on 13 10 / 02 / 2020 were 3 . 24E + 09 and 5 . 63E + 08 for the back cover and front screen , respectively 14 ( Table 3c ) . Considering particles in aerosols deposit onto surfaces at deposition velocities 15 corresponding to their size , the GE that would be deposited onto sampled surfaces was estimated 16 from the GE / cm 3 of air recorded for each size range by the air samplers . From Table S1 , it is 17 evident that the GE recorded for surface samples is of the same order of magnitude ( i . e . , 10 9 ) as 18 that of the GE estimated to deposit from air onto sampled surfaces . 19 Sanger sequencing was used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of the SARS - CoV - 2 20 genome in the sample collected on 10 / 02 / 2020 by stage 4 filter of the PCIS . The genome 21 sequence was deposited in GenBank ( Accession no . MW261767 . 1 ) and is also available through 22 GISAID ( Accession no . EPI _ ISL _ 641318 ) . Genome sequence alignment of SARS - CoV - 2 UF - 30 23 with that of the SARS - CoV - 2 reference strain , Wuhan - Hu - 1 , reveals 99 % identity ( 29879 / 29895 24 rnt ) and no sequence gaps . The deduced amino acid substitutions in UF - 30 compared to those of 25 Wuhan - Hu - 1 are : SPIKE D614G , SPIKE F220L , N G212C , NS3 Q57H , NS8 S24L , NSP2 26 L501F , NSP2 T85I , NSP4 T189I , NSP5 T45I , NSP12 P323L , NSP13 T96I , NSP15 M271V . 27 SARS - CoV - 2 UF - 30 has the D614G mutation , which is dominant in circulating SARS - CoV - 2 28 strains around the world ( Korber et al . , 2020 ; Plante et al . , 2021 ) . It has nucleotide ( Nt ) markers 29 C241T , C3037T , A23403G , G25563T and amino acid markers S - D614G + NS3 - Q57H , which 30 place the virus within GISAID clade GH , which along with GISAID clade G , were the two 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f predominant SARS - CoV - 2 clades in North America in Oct . 2020 ( GISAID , 2021 ) . The genome 1 sequence of UF - 30 conforms to Pango Lineage B . 1 ( version : 2021 - 04 - 23 ) , which is a large 2 European lineage that originated in Northern Italy in 2020 and one that was detected in the US 3 early in 2020 ( Rambaut et al . , 2020 ) . 4 Virus - induced CPE were observed in Vero E6 cells inoculated with air and surface 5 samples collected from volunteer B’s room within 4 days of their inoculation . Since the Cq value 6 was high ( > 34 ) when nucleic acids extracted from the cell growth media of the cell cultures were 7 tested by RT - qPCR for SARS - CoV - 2 , we suspected an additional respiratory virus was present , 8 as we have previously observed in other studies ( Pan et al . , 2017 ; Lednicky et al . , 2020 ) . The 9 GenMark sensor RVP produced a preliminary identification of human adenovirus . To gain 10 insights on the type of adenovirus , we interrogated the sample using the primer systems of Kuo 11 et al . , ( 2009 ) , which produced a specific amplicon of approx . 280 bp using primer pair HAdV 12 ABCDEF - hexon25f and B - hexon308r , presumptively identifying the virus as a B species human 13 adenovirus . For proof , primer pair HAdV B hex - for : 5 - ccgccgcagcagaggagaaag - 3’ and HAdV B 14 hex - rev : 5’ - ctgcagctgctgcttgcaagaagc - 3’ were synthesized and used in PCR to obtain the entire 15 hexon gene sequence . The resulting amplicon was sequenced and informed that volunteer B was 16 co - infected with HAdV species B type 3 . The hexon gene sequence that was obtained is provided 17 in the supplementary material . 18 19 4 . Discussion 20 We detected SARS - CoV - 2 in air - conditioned indoor residential settings , with the air 21 samplers placed ~ 0 . 3 - 2 . 2 m from volunteers who self - isolated following diagnoses of COVID - 22 19 . Only one SARS - CoV - 2 rRT - qPCR positive test resulted among the samples taken on three 23 separate days from volunteer A’s room . The positive sample was recovered on 09 / 25 / 2020 from 24 the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler’s stage 1 tube , and registered a high Cq value of 38 . 21 using 25 primer set LED - N . In contrast , the air and surface samples collected from volunteer B’s room on 26 10 / 02 / 2020 had low Cq values of 15 . 97 - 24 . 73 using the LED - RdRp and 15 . 9 - 23 . 33 with the 27 LED - N gene primer pairs . Information regarding the size fractionations of particles in the 28 aerosols were provided by data generated using the PCIS and NIOSH bioaerosol samplers , which 29 showed the virus - associated particles were > 0 . 25 µm and > 0 . 1 µm respectively . This is 30 consistent with the findings of previous studies on the collection of airborne SARS - CoV - 2 in 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f different settings ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2020b ; Feng et al . , 2021 ; Lednicky et al . , 2021a ; 1 Ong et al . , 2021 ) . In general , particles in the respirable size range , i . e . , particles of size < 4 µm 2 can reach the alveoli upon inhalation ( Brown et al . , 2013 ) . The WHO defines the size of particles 3 in aerosols as < 5 µm ( WHO , 2020a ) . This definition arises from the fact that small droplets ( < 5 4 µm ) and droplet nuclei can remain suspended in air for a long time while droplets ( > 5 µm ) can 5 settle down near the source . Thus , particle size is an important determinant of aerosol behavior 6 and size fractionation of aerosols is helpful in implementing suitable infection control measures 7 ( Fennelly , 2020 ) . Our study shows the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in aerosol particles of size < 4 8 µm in some samples collected by the PCIS and NIOSH bioaerosol samplers , suggesting the 9 possibility of aerosol transmission in a residential self - isolation room . Cq values lower than 25 10 were recorded by rRT - PCR analysis for all the air and surface samples collected , with the lowest 11 being 14 . 58 , from stage 4 filter of PCIS operated in volunteer B’s room on 10 / 02 / 2020 . 12 Estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 GE per cm 3 air show that stage 4 of PCIS which collects particles of 13 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 µm had the highest ( 3 . 04E + 05 ) , while the lowest was from stage 2 , which collects 1 - 2 . 5 14 µm particles . Previously , 1 - 40 copies of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA per m 3 of air were detected using a 15 PCIS in a hospital setting ( Liu et al . , 2020b ) . The infectivity of the virus was not proven in that 16 study , which is likely due to inactivation of the virus owing to long sampling duration ( 260 min 17 to 7 days ) . With lower sampling duration ( 135 min ) and immediate hydration after air sampling , 18 infectious SARS - CoV - 2 was isolated using a PCIS around a minimally symptomatic COVID - 19 19 individual ( Lednicky et al . , 2021a ) . Our attempts to preserve the infectivity of the virus with 20 much lower sampling time ( 90 min ) and immediate hydration of the filters post - sampling were 21 unsuccessful because volunteer B was apparently co - infected with HAdV B3 , which outgrew 22 SARS - CoV - 2 in our Vero E6 cells . Adenovirus B3 causes acute respiratory infections ( Lynch & 23 Kajon , 2016 ) , and likely contributed to the respiratory symptoms experienced by volunteer B . 24 Although a major objective of our environmental study was to determine whether SARS - CoV - 2 25 was infectious in the air and on environmental surfaces , we were unable to make that 26 determination as it was outgrown by the adenovirus . Indeed , this is a challenging issue when 27 multiple viruses that can grow in the same type of host cell are present in the environment 28 ( Lednicky et al . , 2020b ; Lednicky et al . , 2021b ) . The efficiency of collecting infectious virus 29 also differs corresponding to the air sampler deployed for the study . For example , the low 30 efficiency of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler for collecting infectious viruses ( ~ 26 % ) is well 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f documented and a consequence often attributed to drying of the virus along the walls of the tube 1 and filter ( Verreault et al . , 2008 ; Cao et al . , 2011 ; Leung et al . , 2016 ) . This may explain why we 2 were unable to isolate SARS - CoV - 2 from the samples collected by the NIOSH bioaerosol 3 sampler . Herein , isolation in virology means the ability to separate virions from host cells 4 inoculated with samples potentially containing the target virus to demonstrate the infectivity of 5 the virus rather than merely RNA determined from samples . 6 Detection of vRNA on surface samples suggests deposition of particles exhaled by the 7 infected individual onto surfaces through settling of airborne particles or through direct contact . 8 In this study , we recorded Cq values between 21 and 24 for the samples swabbed over volunteer 9 B’s mobile phone on 10 / 02 / 2020 . This demonstrates the deposition of SARS - CoV - 2 on high 10 touch surfaces and the possibility of fomite transmission in a residential setting . Unfortunately , 11 our attempts to isolate SARS - CoV - 2 in cell culture were unsuccessful as volunteer B was co - 12 infected with HAdV B3 and this virus outgrew SARS - CoV - 2 in cell culture . Döhla et al . ( 2020 ) 13 detected SARS - CoV - 2 on the surfaces of different areas in households occupied by quarantined 14 individuals , though all the air samples were negative . The surfaces that tested positive for rRT - 15 qPCR analyses in their study were an electronic device ( remote control ) , two metallic doorknobs 16 and a wooden stove overlay . A household of 2 self - isolating individuals with COVID - 19 had 17 high amounts of vRNA in dust samples ( 10 5 - 10 6 copies / g of floor dust and 10 4 - 10 5 copies / g of 18 HVAC filter dust ) ; while ~ 100 SARS - CoV - 2 N2 gene copies / swab were detected in surface 19 samples ( such as child’s toy , toilet handle and doorknob of primary bedroom ) and 20 copies / cm 2 20 in the carpet of primary bedroom ( Maestre et al . , 2021 ) . Interestingly , the authors detected 21 SARS - CoV - 2 vRNA in the carpet of an unused bedroom ( 4 . 8 N2 copies / cm 2 ) , which they 22 attribute to the dispersal and deposition of virus - laden aerosols shed by the infected individuals . 23 Mouchtouri et al . ( 2020 ) detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in surface swabs collected from doorknobs 24 on the outer side of a toilet door in a ferry boat and a patient room in a nursing home , with Cq 25 values of 37 and 32 , respectively . In the same study , the virus was not detected in other samples 26 collected from the doorknobs of a nursing home and a hospital . Because people in contact with 27 infectious surfaces may also have contact with infected individuals , it is hard to distinguish 28 between airborne and fomite transmission in a given setting . 29 Recently , Eilts et al . ( 2021 ) demonstrated that airborne particles can deposit onto surfaces 30 depending on the velocity and particle size , in a mock work environment . While aerosol particles 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f have longer lifetimes in the air , infectious viral particles may still possibly deposit and later 1 spread by fomite transmission . The equivalent GE deposit on the phone surface from measured 2 GE in aerosol is calculated ( supplementary information ) for comparison with the measured GE 3 on phone surface . The result shows the same order of magnitude as that of the surface samples 4 ( Table S1 vs . Table 3c ) , implying that the deposited material can come from contaminated room 5 air . The comparison points out that aerosol transmission may not mean infection solely spread by 6 inhalation , i . e . , inhalation is not mutually exclusive with deposition and contact transfer or 7 deposition onto an individual . While Port et al . ( 2021 ) showed higher SARS - CoV - 2 disease 8 severity and transmission efficiency for airborne compared to fomite exposure in Syrian 9 hamsters , positive passive surface sample results are equally important to quantify as active 10 aerosol sampler results . 11 Another major factor impacting the transmission and thus collection of airborne SARS - 12 CoV - 2 are the dynamics of COVID - 19 ( He et al . , 2020 ) , i . e . , the events that occur from start to 13 end of an infection within an individual . Generally , peak SARS - CoV - 2 load in the respiratory 14 tract is observed at the time of symptom onset or in the first week of illness , with subsequent 15 decline thereafter , which indicates the highest infection potential just before or within the first 16 five days of symptom onset ( Cevik et al . , 2021 ) . Other studies indicate that infectious virus is not 17 produced by a COVID - 19 patient after a week ( Wölfel et al . , 2020 ) or two ( Sohn et al . , 2020 ) of 18 onset of symptoms , though vRNA is persistently detected by RT - PCR analysis . This may be 19 related to the production of neutralizing antibodies in COVID - 19 patients after 5 - 10 days of 20 infection ( van Kampen et al . , 2021 ) . In our study , the onset of infection in volunteer A is 21 unknown since the patient was asymptomatic initially . The volunteer reported mild symptoms 22 and was active throughout the isolation period . While SARS - CoV - 2 was detected in the air of 23 volunteer B’s room by the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler on 10 / 06 / 2020 , estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 24 GE in air show decline from that collected on 10 / 02 / 2020 . The high Cq values recorded in PCR 25 analysis for the samples collected on 09 / 25 / 2020 and declining SARS - CoV - 2 GEs in air 26 estimated for samples collected on 10 / 06 / 2020 suggests that the concentration of virions shed by 27 the volunteers was low , consistent with expectations during recovery from COVID - 19 . 28 For American healthcare settings that deal with COVID - 19 patients , guidelines regarding 29 stringent infection control practices such as the use of personal protective equipment by the 30 caregiver and the patient , limited in - person visitors , periodical disinfection of the patient rooms , 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f optimized air - handling system , and limited movement of the patient outside of the room , are 1 available ( CDC , 2021a ) . However , these measures may not be followed rigorously in a 2 residential setting . It is thus recommended that CDC guidelines be followed regarding : ( a ) 3 limiting direct contact with the patient , ( b ) living in separate areas without sharing personal 4 items , ( c ) using mask and gloves as applicable when using common spaces , and ( d ) maintaining 5 self - hygiene practices ( CDC , 2021b ) to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus , while sharing a 6 residence with an infected individual . 7 Our study has a few limitations such as a small sample size , inconsistent use of samplers 8 and no measurements on size distribution . Firstly , because infected individuals prefer to reduce 9 social interactions due to the overall emotional burden following SARS - CoV - 2 infection 10 ( Verberk et al . , 2021 ) , knowledge of who is typically infected is restricted to limited numbers of 11 family members and close friends . Thus , gaining access to conduct experiments in their 12 residence is a challenge , at least in the US . Indeed , our study was an opportunistic sampling 13 event . Ideally , a larger cohort , including individuals with varying degrees of symptoms , 14 asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic COVID - 19 patients , such as in quarantine dorms , is 15 warranted to explain the differences in the virus transmission dynamics among these individuals . 16 Secondly , with no standard samplers for collecting airborne viruses ( Pan et al . , 2019 ) and limited 17 knowledge on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in a household setting , defining a standard sampling 18 protocol was not feasible , especially for such a new virus in the community . Thus , we deployed 19 different samplers with an aim to collect suspended particles with and without size fractionation 20 in this opportunistic sampling event . A systematic study to compare various air samplers , such as 21 that by Ratnesar - Shumate et al . ( 2021 ) , and to establish standard protocols to collect airborne 22 viruses is warranted . Thirdly , we did not measure the size distribution of particles in the self - 23 isolation rooms . Consequently , we fixed limits for calculations correlating active samplers and 24 passive samples . Future studies with aerosol measurements will provide information on the 25 relation between passive surface sample results and active aerosol sampler results to better 26 understand the dominating exposure route . 27 28 Conclusions 29 In this study , SARS - CoV - 2 was detected in air with air samplers placed at ~ 1 . 8 m from 30 an infected person with mild symptoms ( volunteer A ) , and ~ 2 . 2 m from an infected person with 31 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f severe symptoms ( volunteer B ) . In vitro isolation of SARS - CoV - 2 detected in volunteer B’s 1 room was challenging since the volunteer was co - infected with another respiratory virus that 2 outgrew SARS - CoV - 2 in cell culture . Cytopathic effects were observed within 4 days post 3 inoculation of the samples , and subsequent partial sequencing of this virus revealed it as HAdV 4 B3 . Results of rRT - PCR analyses of the cell culture with SARS - CoV - 2 primers revealed Cq 5 values of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA were > 34 , indicating either low - level replication or presence of 6 residual virions . With our study consistent with the possibility of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 7 through aerosols and fomites in a residential setting , it is recommended that infected individuals 8 under self - isolation in their own residence and the household members ( 1 ) wear masks when 9 sharing common spaces ; ( 2 ) regularly disinfect self and the environment ; and ( 3 ) have sufficient 10 air circulation through heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ( HVAC ) systems with high air 11 change rates or natural ventilation through open windows , as the weather permits . Such measures 12 can reduce the risk of being exposed to infectious virions released by an infected individual to 13 the environment . 14 15 Acknowledgement 16 The study was funded by National Science Foundation ( Grant No . 2030844 ) and National 17 Institutes of Health ( Grants No .
