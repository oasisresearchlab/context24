ORIGINAL PAPER Cell invasion by Trypanosoma cruzi amastigotes of distinct infectivities : studies on signaling pathways Adriana B . Fernandes & Ivan Neira & Alice T . Ferreira & Renato A . Mortara Received : 14 February 2006 / Accepted : 9 May 2006 / Published online : 22 June 2006 # Springer - Verlag 2006 Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes of the major phylogenetic lineages use specific signaling pathways to invade host cells . Using a panel of drugs , we studied if the differences in the ability of extracellular amastigotes ( EA ) from G ( T . cruzi I ) and CL ( T . cruzi II ) strains to invade host cells could be associated to activation of specific signaling routes . Sonicated extracts from G or CL strain EA induced transient raises in HeLa cell intracellular Ca 2 + levels in a dose - dependent manner . Treatment of EA with drugs that affect Ca 2 + release from inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate - sensitive stores did not signifi - cantly affect the infectivity of either strain , whereas EA of both strains treated with ionomycin plus NH 4 Cl or nigericin that release Ca 2 + from acidocalcisomes had their infectivity reduced . Treatment of parasites with adenylate cyclase activator forskolin increased the infectivity of both strains towards HeLa cells . These data , taken together , suggest that , for host cell invasion , G and CL strain EA engage signaling pathways that lead to an increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and Ca 2 + mobilization from acidocalcisomes . Moreover , treatment of EA with genistein reduced by ~ 45 % the invasion of HeLa cells by G but not by CL strain , implicating a protein tyrosine kinase in the process . In line with this , HeLa cell extracts contained a protein tyrosine kinase activity that mediated the phosphor - ylation of 87 - and 175 - kDa polypeptides of EA from G but not from CL strain . Regarding the target cell response , the activation of host PI3 kinase appears to be required for invasion by either strain as treatment of HeLa cells with wortmannin reduced EA infectivity . These data overall reinforce the concept that cell invasion by T . cruzi EA markedly differs from the process involving metacyclic trypomastigotes . Introduction The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas ’ disease in humans that represents a significant public health problem in Latin America . During its life cycle that takes place in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts , proliferative forms , respectively known as amasti - gotes and epimastigotes , transform into the non - prolifera - tive and highly infective trypomastigotes . In posterior portions of the digestive tract of the invertebrate host , epimastigotes transform into metacyclic trypomastigotes that may then be liberated with the insect ’ s feces and urine . In the vertebrate host , amastigotes multiplying within the host cell transform into trypomastigotes that are released after host cell rupture , reaching the extracellular space and the bloodstream where they may infect other cells ( Brener 1973 ; De Souza 1984 , 2002 ) . The premature lysis of infected cells may release amastigotes to the extracellular Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00436 - 006 - 0236 - 6 A . B . Fernandes : R . A .

Neira Unidad de Parasitología , Facultad Ciencias de la Salud , Universidad de Antofagasta , Antofagasta , Chile milieu ( Behbehani 1973 ; Nogueira and Cohn 1976 ; Hudson et al . 1984 ; Ulisses de Carvalho and De Souza 1986 ) and extracellular differentiation of trypomastigotes may gener - ate amastigote - like forms ( Pan 1978 ; Andrews et al . 1987 ) . These extracellular amastigote forms are capable of invading both professional and non - professional phago - cytes , where they not only survive but can sustain the parasite ’ s life cycle ( Behbehani 1973 ; Nogueira and Cohn 1976 ; Pan 1978 ; Hudson et al . 1984 ; Ley et al . 1988 ; Mortara 1991 ) . Procópio et al . ( 1998 ) investigated the entry of extracellular amastigotes ( EA ) into HeLa and Vero cells as compared to the infectivity of metacyclic trypomasti - gote forms and confirmed that the mechanisms of cell invasion by the two forms is distinct , in line with the previous results of Schenkman et al . ( 1991 ) who observed no competition towards cell binding between them . When HeLa and Vero cells were treated with cytochalasin D before parasite invasion , amastigote invasion was inhibited indicating that , unlike what was observed with trypomastigotes , amastigotes had a more passive role in the entry process ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) . A number of studies have shown that invasion of mammalian cells by T . cruzi requires the activation of signal transduction pathways that lead to an increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration , both in the parasite and the host cell ( Moreno et al . 1994 ; Tardieux et al . 1994 ; Yakubu et al . 1994 ; Ruiz et al . 1998 ) . The efficiency in entering non - phagocytic mammalian cells may vary widely between T . cruzi strains and strains belonging to different phylogenetic lineages , and it has been well established that metacyclic trypomastigotes from CL strain ( T . cruzi II ) are highly invasive whereas parasites from the G strain ( belonging to T . cruzi I ) are poorly infective ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . However , EA of highly infective strains such as Y and CL are poorly infective when compared to type I parasites , particularly from the G strain , showing the opposite behavior of the corresponding metacyclic trypomastigote forms ( Mortara et al . 1999 ; Fernandes and Mortara 2004 ) . For metacyclic trypomasti - gotes , the developmental forms that initiate infection in mammalian hosts , the variability between these strains has been associated to the differential expression of surface glycoproteins that bind to target cells in a receptor - mediated manner and exhibit differential Ca 2 + signaling activities ( Ruiz et al . 1998 ; Yoshida et al . 2000 ) . By treating parasites with different drugs , Neira et al . ( 2002 ) established that the metacyclic trypomastigote forms of G strain ( T . cruzi I ) engage in different signaling mechanisms to invade HeLa cells when compared to CL strain ( T . cruzi II ) parasites . They demonstrated that G strain engages adenylate cyclase activation for cellular invasion whereas CL strain depends on tyrosine phosphorylation to accom - plish this process , and Ca 2 + appears to be mobilized from acidocalcisomes and 1 , 4 , 5 - inositol - triphosphate - sensitive stocks , respectively . In this study , by using drugs that interfere with specific signaling processes , we investigated whether the differ - ences in the ability of EA of G and CL strains to invade HeLa cells could be associated to the activation of specific signaling routes . Although substantial differences between the two strains were not disclosed , our results suggest , that for host cell invasion , G and CL EA engage signaling pathways that lead to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) and parasite intracellular Ca 2 + would be mobilized from acidocalcisomes . A protein tyrosine kinase activity also appears to be associated with G but not with CL strain EA invasion . Materials and methods Cell lines and cultures Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney fibroblasts , obtained from Institute Adolfo Lutz , São Paulo , Brazil ) were grown at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 humid atmosphere , in RPMI - 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , streptomycin ( 100 ìg / ml ) and penicillin ( 100 U / ml ) . These cells were used to maintain the in vitro T . cruzi cycle . HeLa cells , the human - carcinoma - derived epithelial cells ( obtained from American Type Culture Collection ) , which were grown at 37°C in Dulbeccos ’ s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and antibiotics , were used for all cell invasion assays . Parasites In this study , two T . cruzi strains were used : G strain isolated in the Amazon from a marsupial of the Didephidae family ( Yoshida 1983 ) and CL strain isolated in southern Brazil from Triatoma infestans in human dwellings where people were infected with T . cruzi ( Brener and Chiari 1963 ) . Extracellular amastigotes were derived from the axenic differentiation of cell - derived trypomastigotes . Vero - cell - derived trypomastigotes were isolated from culture supernatants of infected cells by centrifugation at 2 , 500× g for 5 min . The pellet was resuspended in liver infusion tryptose ( LIT ) medium and incubated for 24 – 48 h at 37°C , when at least 95 % pure extracellular amastigotes were obtained ( Ley et al . 1988 ; Mortara 1991 ) . Control experiments , carried out to check for the predicted effect of each drug used , were performed with metacyclic trypomastigotes obtained from stationary - phase hemocul - tures of infected mice , in LIT medium ( Camargo 1964 ) . Grace ’ s medium was also used to obtain cultures enriched 60 Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 in metacyclic trypomastigotes , which were purified by passage through diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns ( Yoshida 1983 ) . Cell invasion assays Host cell invasion assays were carried out by seeding parasites onto each well of 24 - well plates containing 13 - mm - diameter round glass coverslip coated with 1 . 5×10 5 HeLa cells , at a parasite - to - cell ratio of 20 : 1 for G strain and 40 : 1 for CL strain . After 1 h of incubation , the triplicate coverslips were washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and stained with Giemsa . Intracellular parasites were scored in a total of 100 cells to calculate the percentage of cell invasion ( Fernandes and Mortara 2004 ) . Determination of intracellular Ca 2 + fluctuations in HeLa cells after addition of extracellular amastigote extracts To measure the fluctuations in cytosolic free Ca 2 + ( [ Ca 2 + ] i ) , the following procedure , based on previously described techniques ( Dorta et al . 1995 ) , was used . In brief , HeLa cells were washed in buffer A , pH 7 . 2 , containing 116 mM NaCl , 5 . 4 mM KCl , 0 . 8 mM MgSO 4 , and 5 . 5 mM N - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - piperazine - N ′ - 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) . After adjusting the concentration to 10 8 cells / ml , the cells were loaded with 5 μ M Fura2 / AM ( Sigma ) for 3 h at room temperature and the non - incorporated Fura2 was washed out . Fluorescence was measured in a fluoro - photometer SPEX AR - CM system ( Spex ) with dual wavelength excitation ( 340 and 380 nm ) and emission set at 510 nm . The variations in HeLa cell [ Ca 2 + ] i , resulting from the addition of parasite extracts ( 50 μ g protein / 100 μ l extract ) to 2 . 5 ml of cell suspension , were calculated as previously described ( Grynkiewicz et al . 1985 ) . R max and R min that correspond to the fluorescence ratios at 340 and 380 nm in the presence of saturating Ca 2 + after treatment with 50 μ M digitonin and in the absence of Ca 2 + upon addition of 10mM EGTA , respectively , were determined for each preparation . The use of cellular extracts instead of live parasites was necessary due to the potential hazard of contamination . Treatment of parasites and HeLa cells with different drugs Treatment of parasites or HeLa cells with 250 μ M genistein or 10 μ M forskolin was performed by incubation of the parasites or HeLa cells at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of the drug , followed by washing in PBS . Other treatments included incubation with 1 μ M thapsigargin for 30 min at 37°C , 1 μ M U73122 for 4 min at 37°C , 100 μ M neomycin for 4 h at 37°C , 10 μ M caffeine for 30 min at 37°C , ionomycin ( 1 μ M ) plus NH 4 Cl ( 20mM ) or nigericin ( 1 μ M ) for 10 min at 37°C , 10 μ M dibutyryl cAMP at room temperature for 15 min , and 10 nM wortmannin for 60 min at 37°C . All drugs were obtained from Sigma and the stock solutions were prepared in dimethylsulphoxide or PBS . To verify that the different treatments were effective , parallel experiments using appropriate G or CL strain metacyclic trypomastigotes as controls ( Neira et al . 2002 ) were carried out in each experiment . Transmission electron microscopy The parasites ( 10 7 / ml ) were washed three times with buffer A ( 119 mM NaCl , 5 . 4 mM KCl , 0 . 8 mM MgSO 4 , 50 mM HEPES , and 5 . 5 mM glucose , pH 7 . 2 ) and resuspended in the same buffer ( 1 : 4 ) . Drops ( 5 – 10 μ l ) of whole parasites , unfixed and unstained , were applied to Formvar / carbon - coated copper grids , and the cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min and then carefully blotted dry ( Lu et al . 1998 ) . The specimens were observed directly by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) using a JEOL 1200 EXII microscope operated at 80 kV . Preparation of HeLa cell extracts HeLa cells washed in PBS were detached by scraping , suspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors ( 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride , 1 mM iodoacetamide , 25 μ g / ml leupeptin , and 25 μ g / ml antipain ) , and then sonicated on ice in an ultrasonic processor XL ( two pulses of 30 s each ) . Once checked under phase contrast microscopy that the cells were disrupted , the sonicated preparation was centrifuged at 12 , 000× g for 5 min , and the supernatant was collected and stored at − 80°C until it was used . Detection of T . cruzi tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins In standard experiments , 5×10 7 parasites were incubated for 20 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of HeLa cell extract ( equivalent to 160 μ g / ml protein ) in a total volume of 200 μ l . After washing in PBS , the parasites were dis - rupted at 4°C in a lysis solution containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors ( 50mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 ; 150 mM NaCl ; 1 mM EDTA ; 1 % Triton X - 100 ; 1 mM NaVO 4 ; 1 mM NaF ; 1mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ; 1 mM iodoacetamide ; 25 μ g / ml leupeptin and 25 μ g / ml antipain ) . The lysates were dissolved in loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in a 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel , under reducing conditions , and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane . After blockage with PBS containing 5 % defatted milk , the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti - phosphotyrosine antibodies ( mouse Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 61 monoclonal antibody from Sigma ) diluted in PBS – milk . After several washes in PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , the membrane was incubated with anti mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase . The final reaction was revealed by chemiluminescence using the ELC Western blotting detection reagent and Hyperfilm - MP from Amersham ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . Quantitation of experiments and statistical calculations All experiments were performed in triplicate using three coverslips . On average , 100 cells per coverslip were analyzed . The statistical calculations were done with SigmaStat ( version 1 . 0 , Jandel Scientific , USA ) , using the t test for significance and standard deviations . Results Increase of HeLa cell intracellular Ca 2 + concentration is induced by extracts of G and CL strain EA The experiments of intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization were carried out by adding parasite extracts to HeLa cells preloaded with Fura - 2 . As shown in Fig . 1 , significant transient increases in [ Ca 2 + ] i were detected after addition of EA extracts from either strain , an effect comparable to that were that of metacyclic trypomastigotes used as positive control ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . The relatively small [ Ca 2 + ] i transients induced by epimastigote form extracts used as negative controls could possibly be due to either a basal contamination of epimastigote cultures with metacyclic trypomastigote forms or a non - specific basal effect . Parasites and HeLa cells are differentially affected by drugs that interfere with intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization We tested several drugs that interfere with intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization on EA infectivity towards HeLa cells . First , we confirmed that , in spite of using twice as much CL parasites ( 40 : 1 , parasites to HeLa cells ) , G strain EA ( used at 20 : 1 ratio ) displayed much higher infectivity . Using the protocol for cell infection , we found in control samples ( untreated parasites ) around 320 G strain EA per 100 cells , compared to around 180 of the CL strain . To determinate the effect of U73122 ( Bleasdale et al . 1990 ) and neomycin ( Ma and Michel 1998 ) , phospholipase C inhibitors , the parasites were incubated in the absence or presence of the drugs . As shown in Fig . 2 , G and CL strains infectivity was unaltered by pretreatment with either compound . By contrast , the treat - ment of HeLa cells with U73122 or neomycin inhibited to some extent the penetration of parasites from both strains . To test whether cell invasion involved Ca 2 + mobilization from intracellular stores , EA from G or CL strains were treated with thapsigargin or caffeine . Similarly to what was observed with phospholipase C inhibitors , EA infectivity was somewhat reduced only when HeLa cells were pre - treated with these drugs ( Fig . 2 ) . Positive controls for drug treatment were run in parallel with CL strain metacyclic trypomastigotes , which display marked reduction in their infectivity upon treatment of parasites with these compounds ( not shown ; Neira et al . 2002 ) . Fig . 1 EA extracts from G and CL strains induce increases in HeLa cell intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in a dose - depen - dent manner . Intracellular calcium transients induced by different T . cruzi infective forms . Sonicated extracts of EA , containing an equivalent of 5×10 7 parasites / 50 μ l were added separately to live HeLa cells preloaded with Fura2 . Extracts of epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes ( G strain , 5×10 7 parasites / 50 μ l ) were used as negative and positive controls , respectively . These traces are representative of at least four independent experiments 62 Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 Drugs that interfere with Ca 2 + release from acidocalcisomes inhibit HeLa cell invasion by EA from both T . cruzi strains Acidocalcisomes , the acidic vacuoles containing Ca 2 + / H + exchange system rich in Ca 2 + , have been detected in all developmental stages of T . cruzi ( Docampo et al . 1995 , 2005 ) . To examine the participation of acidocalcisomes in the Ca 2 + response required for host cell invasion by EA , the parasites or HeLa cells were treated with calcium ionophore ionomycin , combined with NH 4 Cl or nigericin , compounds that increase the pH of acidic compartments and release Ca 2 + ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . As shown in Fig . 3 , the treatment of parasites with these drugs caused a small but significant inhibition of HeLa cell invasion by EA from both G and CL strains but had no direct effect upon the target cells . G strain metacyclic trypomastigotes that mobilize Ca 2 + from acid - ocalcisomes to invade HeLa cells were used in these experiments as positive controls for drug treatments ( not shown ; Neira et al . 2002 ) . The detection and quantification of acidocalcisomes in the EA from G and CL strains was by transmission electron microscopy . As the drugs that interfere with calcium recruitment from acidocalcisomes inhibit EA invasion , we carried out morphological observations by TEM of EA from G and CL strain to verify possible differences in the relative abundance of these organelles . Acidocalcisomes in whole EA , mounted without any treatment such as fixation or staining , appear as electron - dense granules of different sizes ( Fig . 4 ) . The acidocalcisomes were equally abundant in EA from G and CL strains : 23 . 2±8 ( G strain ) and 22 . 5±6 ( CL strain ) electron - dense granules / parasite ( n = 23 ) . Adenylyl cyclase activation increases infectivity of EA from G and CL strains Cyclic AMP , synthesized from ATP by adenylyl cyclase , is a ubiquitous messenger that has been shown to play a role in the control of T . cruzi growth and differentiation ( Oliveira et al . 1984 ; Gonzales - Perdomo et al . 1988 ) . The activation of parasite adenylyl cyclase with forskolin increased HeLa cell invasion by EA from both G and CL strains ( Fig . 5 ) . By contrast , the treatment of HeLa cells with this drug did not affect infection by EA of either strain . The involvement of cAMP in EA internalization was further examined in experiments in which the parasites were pre - incubated with dibutyryl cAMP , a phosphodies - terase inhibitor . Pretreatment of parasites with 10 μ M dibutyryl cAMP also resulted in an increase ( ∼ 35 % ) of Fig . 3 Release of Ca 2 + from parasite acidocalcisomes reduced the infectivity of EA from G and CL strains towards HeLa cells . EA or HeLa cells were pretreated or not with the indicated drugs .

EA or HeLa cells were pretreated or not with the indicated inhibitors . The results of invasion assays are expressed as percentage of parasites in relation to controls , counted in 100 cells in triplicate coverslips ( * p < 0 . 05 ) . These results represent the means ± standard deviations of three independent experiments Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 63 HeLa cell invasion by parasites of both T . cruzi strains ( data not shown ) . The positive controls were carried out using G strains metacyclic trypomastigotes that , upon treatment with forskolin , had their infectivity towards HeLa cells increased ( not shown ; Neira et al . 2002 ) . Host cell PI3K activation increases EA internalization The involvement of P13 kinase ( PI3K ) in T . cruzi host cell invasion has been examined by using specific inhibitors like wortmannin ( Burgering and Coffer 1995 ; Todorov et al . 2000 ; Wilkowsky et al . 2001 ; Woolsey et al . 2003 ) . The treatment of EA from either G or CL strain with wortmannin had no effect on HeLa cell invasion ( Fig . 6 ) . However , the treatment of HeLa cells significantly dimin - ished the infectivity of parasites from both strains ( Fig . 6 ) . These data suggest that PI3K activity is implicated in the entry of EA into non - phagocytic mammalian cells . Host cell invasion by EA from G and CL strains is differentially affected by treatment of parasites with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor Protein tyrosine kinases are also involved in cellular invasion by T . cruzi infective forms , as the inhibitor genistein affects invasion of both amastigote ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) as well as of metacyclic trypomastigote ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . When we tested the effect of 250 μ M genistein on EA invasion of HeLa cells , only EA from the G strain had their infectivity reduced by ∼ 45 % ( Fig . 7 ) , in line with previously described observations ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) . The treatment of host cells with genistein did not affect Fig . 5 EA from G or CL strain treated with forskolin have increased infectivity towards HeLa cells . EA or HeLa cells were pretreated or not with 10 µM forskolin for 30 min at 37 °C . The results of invasion assays are expressed as percentage of intracellular parasites in relation to controls , counted in 100 cells in triplicate coverslips ( * p < 0 . 05 ) . These results represent the means ± standard deviations of three independent experiments Fig . 4 Acidocalcisomes in EA of CL and G strains . EA were placed directly onto coated grids and examined under transmission electron microscopy . Acidocalcisomes appear as electron - dense spots ( arrows ) . Scale bars , 1 μ m 64 Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 invasion by EA from either G or CL strain , indicating that host cell protein tyrosine kinases are not implicated . Genistein also reduced the invasion of CL strain metacyclic trypomastigotes , used as positive control for this drug ( not shown ; Neira et al . 2002 ) . Protein - tyrosine - kinase - mediated phosphorylation is in - ducible by HeLa cell extract in G but not in CL strain EA . It has been shown that HeLa cell invasion by CL strain metacyclic forms requires the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates a 175 - kDa protein ( p175 ) ( Favoreto et al . 1998 ) . This phosphorylation is inducible by soluble HeLa cell extracts and inhibitable by genistein and occurs in CL but not in G strain parasites ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . Based on these studies , tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins in EA extracts from G and CL strains were examined by Western blotting using anti - phosphotyrosine antibodies . In G strain , EA tyrosine phosphorylation of 87 and 175 kDa proteins was inducible by soluble HeLa cell extracts ( Fig . 8 ) . In contrast to G strain , CL strain EA polypeptides of 87 and 170 kDa displayed high tyrosine phosphorylation content regardless of parasite contact with HeLa cell soluble components ( Fig . 8 ) . In these experiments , metacyclic forms of G strain that contain a tyrosine - phosphorylated form of p175 insensitive to HeLa cell extracts and epimastigote forms were added as positive and negative controls , respectively ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . Discussion The mechanisms by which T . cruzi infective forms gain access to the intracellular milieu are gradually being disclosed . Our findings contribute to further understanding the mode of cell invasion by EA of T . cruzi strains G and CL , which belong to distinct phylogenetic groups . They also reinforce the concept that EA differ markedly from metacyclic trypomastigotes , as target cell invasion is concerned . The involvement of parasite ligands and host cell receptors for particular duets ( Ming et al . 1995 ; Scharfstein et al . 2000 ; Magdesian et al . 2001 ) has been characterized and the signaling pathways involved in these different interactions are being intensively studied ( Yoshida et al . 2000 ; Neira et al . 2002 ; Burleigh and Woolsey 2002 ) . Fig . 7 G strain EA treated with genistein had reduced infectivity towards HeLa cells . EA or HeLa cells were pretreated or not with 250 μ M genistein for 30 min at 37 °C . The results of invasion assays are expressed as percentage of intracellular parasites , counted in 100 cells in triplicate coverslips ( * p < 0 . 05 ) . These results represent the means ± standard deviations of three independent experiments Fig . 6 HeLa cell PI3 kinase activity is required for invasion by EA from G and CL strains . EA or HeLa cells were pretreated or not with 10 nM wortmannin for 60 min at 37 °C . The results of invasion assays are expressed as percentage of intracellular parasites in relation to controls , counted in 100 cells in triplicate coverslips ( * p < 0 . 05 ) . These results represent the means ± standard deviations of three independent experiments Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 65 In spite of the growing evidence regarding the components implicated in trypomastigote invasion , the signaling path - ways involved in T . cruzi amastigote invasion remain unknown . HeLa cell calcium transients triggered by T . cruzi extracellular amastigotes Similar to what has been observed for metacyclic trypo - mastigotes ( Dorta et al . 1995 ; Ruiz et al . 1998 ) , cellular extracts from extracellular amastigotes induce significant transient raises in target cell cytoplasmic calcium levels ( Fig . 1 ) . For metacyclic trypomastigotes , the 82 - kDa surface glycoprotein ( gp82 ) has been implicated , thus promoting cell invasion ( Yoshida et al . 2000 ) . It is interesting to note that the extracts of metacyclic trypomas - tigotes of either G or CL strains that express distinct repertoires of surface molecules related to their different infectivities are capable of inducing comparable levels of intracellular calcium transient raises in HeLa cells ( Ruiz et al . 1998 ) , similar to what has been observed here for EA of the same strains . In a previous work , we found that EA from T . cruzi I strains are typically more infective than T . cruzi II parasites ( Mortara et al . 1999 ; Fernandes and Mortara 2004 ) . The amastigote surface component ( s ) that trigger the HeLa cell calcium oscillations observed here have not yet been identified but preliminary evidences indicate that a carbohydrate epitope defined by a monoclo - nal antibody designated 1D9 , abundant in T . cruzi I amastigotes ( Barros et al . 1997 ; Mortara et al . 1999 ) , could be implicated in this process . Signaling pathways activated during HeLa cell invasion by T . cruzi extracellular amastigotes Whereas metacyclic trypomastigotes of G and CL strains clearly engage distinct routes for cell invasion ( Neira et al . 2002 ) , amastigotes of the same strains , which display cellular infectivity as opposite to that of metacyclic trypomastigotes , do not show such differences . For instance , drugs like thapsigargin and U73122 that have an effect on cell invasion by CL strain metacyclic forms do not show significant effect on EA invasion of either CL or G strain . A discrete effect was observed only when HeLa cells were treated with these compounds ( Fig . 2 ) . The enhancement of EA adenylate cyclase activity and the recruitment of calcium from acidocalcisomes by both G and CL strains appear to be required for HeLa cell invasion , both characteristics only found in G strain metacyclic trypomastigotes ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . It is interesting to note that EA of both G and CL strain appear to mobilize calcium from acidocalcisomes that are equally abundant in these parasites , in a process that could be modulated by cAMP . HeLa cell treatment with wortmannin , a PI3 kinase inhibitor that interferes with tissue - culture trypomastigote invasion in several cell types , also inhibits EA invasion ( Fig . 6 ) . In fact , of all the drugs tested , the greatest inhibition in cell invasion was obtained when HeLa cells , but not the parasites , were treated with this compound ( Fig . 7 ) . These results , suggesting pathways akin to tissue - culture trypomastigotes , indicate that host cell PI3 kinase is activated for HeLa cell invasion EA of both G and CL strains . Lysosomal markers appear in trypomastigote para - sitophorous vacuoles after an orchestrated sequence of events that involve cell PI3 kinase pathways and the recruitment of endosomal as well as lysosomal markers ( Todorov et al . 2000 ; Wilkowsky et al . 2001 , 2002 ; Woolsey et al . 2003 ; Andrade and Andrews 2004 ) . We have observed that a proportion of recently internalized EA from both G and CL strains may be found in para - sitophorous vacuoles displaying endosomal marker EEA - 1 ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , after invasion of HeLa cells , EA are found in parasitophorous vacuoles positive for lysosomal marker Lamp - 1 ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) that is now believed to be a downstream marker of parasitopho - rous vacuole maturation . Of the several drugs that were employed in this study to verify the possible differences between G and CL strain EA , only the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein had a distinct effect . In fact G , but not CL , EA infectivity was reduced upon inhibition of parasite tyrosine kinase activity , indicating that , in this respect , G strain EA behave like the highly infective CL strain metacyclic trypomastigotes ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . In this context , it seems relevant that the HeLa cell extracts specifically induce G strain EA Fig . 8 HeLa cells induce tyrosine phosphorylation of 175 and 87 kDa proteins in G strain EA . The parasites were incubated for 20 min at 37°C in the absence ( − ) or presence ( + ) of HeLa cells extract ( HCE ) , washed in PBS and disrupted in Triton X - 100 lysis solution . The lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti - phospho - tyrosine antibodies . Metacyclic trypomastigotes ( Meta G ) and epi - mastigotes ( Epi G ) were run as positive and negative controls , respectively . The arrowheads indicate the relevant polypeptides in G ( Ama G ) and CL ( Ama CL ) strains EA 66 Parasitol Res ( 2006 ) 100 : 59 – 68 tyrosine phosphorylation of 175 - and 87 - kDa polypeptides . By contrast , the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of both 170 - and 87 - kDa polypeptide in CL strain EA are not affected by HeLa cell extracts ( Fig . 8 ) . Our results , taken together , clearly demonstrate that the signaling pathways engaged during HeLa cell invasion by T . cruzi extracellular amastigotes are distinct from the routes used by G or CL strain metacyclic trypomastigotes . The drugs that differentially affected invasion of either G or CL strain metacyclics had little or no discriminative effect on EA . With the available data , we hypothesize that , to invade HeLa cells , EA of both strains recruit calcium from acidocalcisomes through a putative cAMP - sensitive chan - nel and mobilize a PI3 - kinase - dependent pathway of the target cell . Although we cannot formally demonstrate it yet , the higher infectivity of G strain EA could be related to their ability to induce larger calcium transients in the host cell and their susceptibility to the tyrosine kinase activity . The identification and characterization of surface compo - nents of EA amastigotes involved in these events will clearly hopefully substantiate these hypotheses .
