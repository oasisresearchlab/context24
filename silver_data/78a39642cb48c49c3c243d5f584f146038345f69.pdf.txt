As with all protein tyrosine phosphatases the activity of PTPN22 is redox 38 regulated , but if or how such regulation can modulate inflammatory pathways in vivo is not 39 known . To determine this , we created a mouse with a cysteine - to - serine mutation at position 40 129 in PTPN22 ( C129S ) , a residue proposed to alter the redox regulatory properties of PTPN22 41 by forming a disulfide with the catalytic C227 residue . The C129S mutant mouse showed a 42 stronger T cell - dependent inflammatory response and development of T cell dependent 43 autoimmune arthritis due to enhanced TCR signaling and activation of T cells , an effect 44 neutralized by a mutation in Ncf1 , a component of the NOX2 complex . Activity assays with 45 3 purified proteins suggest that the functional results can be explained by an increased 46 sensitivity to oxidation of the C129S mutated PTPN22 protein . We also observed that the 47 disulfide of native PTPN22 can be directly reduced by the thioredoxin system , while the C129S 48 mutant lacking this disulfide was less amenable to reductive reactivation . In conclusion , we 49 show that PTPN22 functionally interacts with Ncf1 and is regulated by oxidation via the non - 50 catalytic C129 residue and oxidation - prone PTPN22 leads to increased severity in the 51 development of T cell - dependent autoimmunity . 52 Significance statement : A hitherto unstudied aspect of PTPN22 biology is its regulation by cell 53 redox states . Here we created a mouse model where PTPN22 was mutated to respond 54 differentially to redox levels in vivo and found that PTPN22 function is regulated by reactive 55 oxygen species and that redox regulation of PTPN22 impacts T - cell - dependent autoimmune 56 inflammation . 57 58 59 4 Introduction 60 Complex autoimmune diseases affect 4 - 5 % of the human population and large efforts have 61 been invested in finding the underlying genetic polymorphisms [ 1 ] . Though a major genetic 62 contribution comes from the major histocompatibility complex region , many other loci have 63 also been identified . Two important single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) have emerged , 64 one located in PTPN22 [ 2 ] , a cytoplasmic class I protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) , and the 65 other in NCF1 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] , a component of the NOX2 complex , controlling induction of reactive 66 oxygen species ( ROS ) in antigen presenting cells . Mutations in Ncf1 , leading to a lower NOX2 67 dependent ROS response , have been shown to be a major predisposing genetic factor for 68 autoimmune diseases in both mice and humans [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . PTPN22 is primarily a dominant 69 negative regulator of T cell responsiveness , acting by dephosphorylating important target 70 proteins in the T cell signaling machinery including LCK , FYN and ZAP70 [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . Studies on 71 PTPN22 have thus far focused on the effects of knocking out the gene or on the autoimmune 72 variant PTPN22 - R620W , but with divergent results [ 7 ] . Importantly , however , PTPN22 is likely 73 to be redox regulated . Its activity is , as with other protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) , 74 dependent upon the integrity of a catalytic active site Cys residue . The reactivity of this 75 cysteine makes it particularly susceptible to oxidation via reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) 76 leading to concomitant abrogation of PTP activity . Reversible oxidation and reduction of such 77 reactive cysteines has previously been shown to be a regulatory mechanism in signal 78 transduction , regulating important T cell downstream signaling molecules such as NF - KB , 79 NRF2 , MAPK and ERK [ 8 ] - [ 9 ] . Control of redox regulation of PTPs in cells depends upon the 80 balance between inhibitory oxidation of the catalytic Cys residue and its activation by 81 reduction , where the latter is typically maintained by the thioredoxin system . We have now 82 investigated the possibility that redox regulation of PTPN22 could modulate inflammatory 83 5 pathways in vivo . Interestingly , the PTPN22 catalytic cysteine ( C227 ) has been suggested to 84 form a disulfide bond with another “ back - door ” cysteine ( C129 ) , possibly altering the 85 threshold for irreversible oxidation of C227 and thereby affecting the redox state of the active 86 site [ 10 ] . By creating a mouse with a cysteine - to - serine mutation at position 129 in PTPN22 87 ( C129S ) we could investigate the possible pathophysiological impact of its redox regulatory 88 properties in vivo . We found that mice with this amino acid replacement developed increased 89 T cell - dependent inflammatory responses due to enhanced T cell receptor signaling , which 90 was dependent on NOX2 - produced ROS . This correlated well with findings of a lower overall 91 turnover , higher sensitivity to inhibitory oxidation , and a lower capacity of reductive 92 reactivation by the thioredoxin system of recombinant mutant PTPN22 C129S , as compared to 93 wild - type PTPN22 . These results show that redox regulation of PTPN22 modulates 94 inflammation in vivo , with a lower resistance to oxidation of PTPN22 promoting aggravated 95 disease . 96 Results 97 Recombinant PTPN22 C129S has lower catalytic activity , higher sensitivity to inhibition by 98 oxidation and lower capacity for reductive reactivation by the thioredoxin system 99 To investigate the potential impact of a C129S replacement in the PTPN22 protein , we 100 recombinantly produced the catalytic domain of the corresponding human wild - type PTPN22 101 and PTPN22 C129S mutant proteins ( the C129 and the catalytic C227 residues have the same 102 numbering in both mouse and human ) . The recombinant proteins were purified to > 95 % 103 purity as judged by SDS - PAGE and kinetic parameters were determined using p - NPP as 104 substrate ; wild - type PTPN22 enzyme had a basal turnover of 19 . 6 min - 1 with a K m of 4 . 57 mM 105 while PTPN22 C129S displayed a turnover of 11 . 9 min - 1 and a K m of 8 . 02 mM under the same 106 6 conditions , showing that the C129S protein has retained PTP activity but with an overall lower 107 catalytic efficiency ( Fig . 1A ) which confirms Tsai et al . ’s results [ 10 ] . 108 Next , we wanted to assess sensitivity of pre - reduced wild - type PTPN22 to inhibition by 109 oxidation . We found that addition of 50 µM H 2 O 2 to the pure protein led to inhibition of 110 approximately half the activity after 20 min incubation ( Fig . 1B ) . We also found that addition 111 of bicarbonate together with H 2 O 2 noticeably potentiated the inactivation ( Fig . 1C ) , similar to 112 the properties shown earlier for PTP1B that are likely due to formation of 113 peroxymonocarbonate that reacts more efficiently than H 2 O 2 with the PTP enzyme [ 11 ] . When 114 comparing the H 2 O 2 - sensitivity of PTPN22 C129S with that of wild - type PTPN22 , we found that 115 the mutant enzyme was clearly more sensitive to inhibition by H 2 O 2 than wild - type PTPN22 , 116 although it had a lower basal turnover ( Fig . 1D ) . The same effect was also seen in the presence 117 of a functional thioredoxin system of thioredoxin reductase 1 ( TrxR1 ) coupled with thioredoxin 118 ( Trx1 ) , but perhaps less so coupled with thioredoxin related protein of 14 kDa ( TRP14 ) ( Fig . 119 1E ) . It should be noted that also PTP1B displays different reactivities with Trx1 and TRP14 [ 12 ] , 120 which may have physiological importance . 121 True redox regulation of PTPN22 requires that the fully oxidized and thus inactivated enzyme 122 can be subsequently reactivated by reduction . Since the thioredoxin system has been 123 previously shown to reactivate phosphatases PTP1B and PTEN [ 11 ] [ 13 ] [ 16 ] , we next tested 124 this property . We found that H 2 0 2 - inactivated PTPN22 species could be re - activated in vitro 125 using either DTT as reductant , or the thioredoxin system composed of NADPH together with 126 TrxR1 and Trx1 . Interestingly , wild - type PTPN22 , but not the PTPN22 C129S mutant , could be 127 directly reactivated by TrxR1 together with NADPH , without inclusion of Trx1 ( Fig . 2A ) . 128 Subsequent experiments showed that the effect of TrxR1 - dependent reactivation was 129 7 concentration dependent and that the oxidized forms of wild - type PTPN22 were clearly more 130 amenable to direct reactivation by TrxR1 than those of PTPN22 C129S ( Fig . 2B ) . Since the only 131 difference between PTPN22 and PTPN22 C129S is the integrity of the non - catalytic C129 residue , 132 we reasoned that the direct reductive reactivation by TrxR1 + NADPH of wild - type PTPN22 , not 133 seen with the PTPN22 C129S mutant , might indicate that TrxR1 can directly reduce the disulfide 134 involving C129 that may be formed in the wild - type PTPN22 enzyme . To assess this possibility , 135 we subjected both forms of the enzyme to oxidative conditions , or to reduction by either DTT 136 or TrxR1 , and then analyzed the enzymes on a non - reducing SDS - PAGE . Indeed , only PTPN22 137 but not PTPN22 C129S displayed a second faster migrating form of the protein upon oxidation 138 that disappeared upon reduction with DTT or TrxR1 ( Fig . 2C ) . The effect was seen with several 139 concentrations of H 2 O 2 and DTT treatment could always revert the double band of PTPN22 140 ( Suppl . Fig . S1 ) . We also found that the reactivation of wild - type PTPN22 , with either DTT or 141 the thioredoxin system ( TrxR1 alone , or coupled with either Trx1 or TRP14 ) , was always more 142 efficient than that of the mutant PTPN22 C126S enzyme , also in cases where prior oxidation was 143 further potentiated by bicarbonate ( Suppl . Fig . S2 ) . 144 These findings with recombinant human PTPN22 and PTPN22 C129S enzymes suggest that the 145 mutant is more amenable to oxidation and that the thioredoxin system is less efficient in 146 reactivating its oxidized form . The notion that TrxR1 directly can reduce the disulfide which is 147 not formed in the mutant enzyme , but which may be formed upon oxidation of wild - type 148 PTPN22 , was interesting , as to our knowledge no PTP has earlier been shown to form a 149 disulfide species that is a direct substrate of TrxR1 . Based upon these findings , we propose a 150 model for redox regulation of PTPN22 ( Fig . 2D ) , which illustrates how PTPN22 C129S can be more 151 easily inactivated than the wild - type enzyme . Next , we wished to assess if mutant PTPN22 C129S 152 yields any phenotypic effects in mouse models of inflammation . 153 8 Establishment of PTPN22 C129S mutant mice 154 To study redox - dependent regulation of PTPN22 in vivo and its possible downstream effects 155 on inflammation we generated a mouse with the PTPN22 C129S mutation ( schematic in Fig . 3A ) . 156 This disrupts the mechanism by which the catalytic C227 can be protected through formation 157 of a disulfide that can be reduced by TrxR1 ( Fig . 2D ) , thus making PTPN22 C129S in the mice more 158 prone to inactivation by oxidation . The mice were backcrossed to C57Bl6 / N mice together 159 with a major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) region containing an Aq MHC class II allele , 160 making it susceptible to autoimmune arthritis [ 15 ] , and also with the m1j mutation of Ncf1 161 [ 16 ] , allowing interaction studies . 162 PTPN22 C129S enhances Th1 - mediated inflammation via NOX2 - mediated ROS 163 To study the effect of PTPN22 C129S on cell - mediated immunity we used the delayed - type 164 hypersensitivity ( DTH ) model , which is known to drive inflammation via IFN ɣ producing type 165 1 T helper cells ( Th1 ) [ 17 ] . Littermate wild - type and PTPN22 C129S mice were immunized with 166 heterologous collagen type II ( COL2 ) , challenged on day 8 by injection with the same antigen 167 in the ear and subsequently , swelling was assessed . We observed increased ear pinna 168 thickness in PTPN22 C129S mice 24 , 48 and 72 hours after challenge compared to littermate wild - 169 type mice ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , PTPN22 C129S did not enhance ear swelling in NCF1 mutant mice 170 with a lack of NOX2 activity ( Fig . 3C ) [ 18 ] . To assess the antigen - specific T cell response we re - 171 stimulated cells from inguinal lymph nodes with the immunodominant COL2 peptide ( 259 - 172 273 ) and observed a marked increase in IFN ɣ and IL - 2 producing PTPN22 C129S cells when 173 comparing wild - type supporting a Th1 phenotype ( Fig . 3D , 3E ) . No difference was observed 174 on the NCF1 mutant background . Within the ears , flow cytometry analysis showed that the 175 challenge with COL2 increased percentages of CD45 + leucocytes and CD45 + TCRb + cells as 176 9 compared to PBS injection with the NCF1 mutants showing higher cell infiltration even in PBS - 177 injected ears ( Fig . 3F ) . Additionally , we observed higher CD4 expression in COL2 - injected 178 PTPN22 ears as compared to wild - type with no difference in the NCF1 mutants ( Fig . 3G ) . To 179 further support the Th1 phenotype we performed qPCR analysis of the ears which showed 180 increased expression of CXCR3 in inflamed PTPN22 C129S ears ( Fig . 3H ) . 181 In the periphery , immunized PTPN22 C129S mice had increased cell numbers in the spleen as 182 compared to wild - type ( Fig . 3I ) . Within the inguinal lymph nodes we observed a reduction in 183 CD4 + T cells which expressed higher levels of CD44 , a marker for effector - memory T cells 184 ( Fig . 3J ) . This was not seen in circulating T cells within the blood , however there was a 185 significant reduction in FOXP3 + T cells in PTPN22 C129S mice 48 hours after initial immunization 186 ( Fig . S3A ) . 187 As we observed differences in T cell activation levels , we wanted to address the role of 188 PTPN22 C129S in antigen - specific T cells . To do this , we used the V β 12 - transgenic mouse ( V β 12 - 189 tg ) which expresses a TCR  chain specific for the galactosylated COL2 ( 260 - 270 ) epitope and 190 can be tracked using the clonotypic B22a1 antibody . Upon priming of V β 12 - tg mice with COL2 191 these T cells expand 50 - fold , acquire an activated phenotype and play an important role in the 192 early phase of the arthritogenic immune response [ 19 ] . Upon immunization with COL2 , 193 PTPN22 C129S did not affect the expansion of antigen - specific V β 12 + T cells per se ( Fig . 3K ) , but 194 did change their activation status : COL2 reactive T cells in the periphery expressed higher 195 levels of CD44 on CD4 + T cells as compared to wild - type ( Fig . 3K ) . In the DTH model , we could 196 also observe higher B22a1 expression among CD4 + T cells in the inflamed ears of 197 V β 12 . PTPN22 C129S mice ( Fig . 3L ) . 198 10 Together , these results indicate that the oxidation prone PTPN22 C129S mutant enhances T cell - 199 mediated inflammation . Conversely , wild - type PTPN22 with a higher basal activity and more 200 resistance to oxidation counteracts these inflammatory processes . 201 PTPN22 C129S enhances T cell responses and development of arthritis 202 As PTPN22 is heavily associated with the development of autoimmunity we also sought to 203 explore the effects of PTPN22 C129S on arthritis development by using the glucose - 6 - phosphate - 204 isomerase peptide ( GPIp ) - induced arthritis model ( GIA ) , which causes acute autoimmunity 205 that resembles the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis , and which is regulated by NOX2 - 206 derived ROS [ 20 , 21 ] [ 21 ] . As shown in Fig . 4A , we observed increased arthritis severity in 207 PTPN22 C129S mice from day 10 up to day 22 after onset as well as increased incidence in mutant 208 mice . On the NCF1 deficient background we observed a trend in the opposite direction with 209 PTPN22 C129S mice showing less disease and no significant difference in disease incidence ( Fig . 210 4B ) . 211 Increased disease was further supported by higher antigen - specific T cell responses in 212 PTPN22 C129S mice as shown by increased numbers of IFN ɣ - secreting T cells , both upon GPIp 213 and anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 stimulation ( Fig . 4C ) . CD4 T cells in the draining lymph nodes exhibited 214 increased activation as evidenced by higher numbers of CD4 + CD69 + , CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + and 215 CD4 + PD1 + T cells ( Fig . 4D ) . No differences were observed in serum antibody levels against the 216 hGPI peptide ( Fig . 4E ) . In summary , PTPN22 C129S enhances autoimmune inflammation due to 217 enhanced T cell reactivity . 218 219 220 11 PTPN22 C129S enhances T cell signaling in vitro and slightly affects thymic T cell development 221 To understand where the observed T cell activation phenotype in PTPN22 C129S mice originates 222 from , we first confirmed that PTPN22 expression was comparable between wild - type , 223 PTPN22 C129S , NCF1 m1J and PTPN22 C129S / NCF1 m1J mice , both via mRNA and protein analysis ( Fig . 224 5A - B ; Fig . S3B ) . Next , we analyzed expansion of naïve immune cell populations . PTPN22 C129S 225 was found to not affect immune cell populations in peripheral lymphoid organs in naïve mice ; 226 the percentages of B cells ( B220 + ) , T cells ( CD3 + ) , dendritic cells ( CD11c + ) and macrophages 227 ( CD11B + ) were comparable to wild - type littermates as was MHC II expression on antigen - 228 presenting cells ( Fig . S3C ) . 229 As PTPN22 has been previously shown to affect T cell tolerance [ 14 ] [ 15 ] , we analyzed T cell 230 development in the thymus . We observed a slight reduction in the percentage of CD4 - CD8 - 231 ( DN ) population whilst CD4 + CD8 + ( DP ) , CD4 + , and CD8 + were comparable between groups . 232 Further fractionation of the early CD4 - CD8 - progenitor population showed a slight increase in 233 DN1 ( CD44 + CD25 - ) and decrease in DN4 ( CD44 - CD25 - ) populations in PTPN22 C129S thymi ( Fig . 234 5C ) . No changes were observed in TCRb , CD5 and CD69 expression ( Fig . 5C ) . Percentages of 235 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells as well as expression of CD44 , and CD69 activation markers on CD4 + T 236 cells were not affected ( Fig . 5D ) . Furthermore , percentages of CD4 + FOXP3 + and 237 CD4 + FOXP3 + CD25 + cells were comparable between groups in thymus and peripheral 238 lymphoid organs . ( Fig . 5D ) . 239 As we consistently observed a differential T cell phenotype in mice with mutated PTPN22 C129S 240 in vivo , we studied T cell function in vitro . To assess signaling , we measured Ca 2 + - flux , one of 241 the earliest signaling events upon TCR engagement and observed slighly increased 242 intracellular Ca 2 + in PTPN22 C129S CD4 T cells upon anti - CD3 stimulation ( Fig . 5E ) . Proliferation 243 12 of CD4 T cells , as assessed by CellTrace dilution , was also increased upon anti - CD3 / antiCD28 244 stimulation ( Fig . 5F ) . We observed increased activation of ex vivo - stimulated CD4 T cells as 245 measured by the early T cell activation marker CD69 as well as markedly different IFN ɣ 246 production resembling the in vivo results ( Fig . 5G - H ) . 247 Enhanced phosphorylation of PTPN22 targets and enhanced PKC expression in PTPN22 C129S 248 cells 249 To assess whether the differences in T cell reactivity could be correlated with altered PTPN22 250 catalytic activity we analyzed the phosphorylation of its targets Fyn , LCK and Zap70 . TCR - 251 stimulation of wild - type and mutant cells revealed increases in phosphorylation of tyrosines 252 Y420 and Y394 of the Src family kinases Fyn and LCK , respectively as well as of Y493 of Zap70 , 253 thus agreeing well with lower intracellular phosphatase activity of the PTPN22 C129S mutant 254 protein ( Fig . 6A - B ) and confirming findings with recombinant PTPN22 proteins . 255 Next , we wanted to assess if downstream T cell - signaling mediators were affected by 256 PTPN22 C129S . TCR - signaling induces activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) - θ , an essential player 257 in peripheral T cell activation . As compared to wild - type , PTPN22 C129S lymph node cells showed 258 constitutive phosphorylation of Y538 on PKC - θ , independent of TCR stimulation whereas in 259 wild - type cells phosphorylation increased with TCR stimulation , hinting at higher basal activity 260 of PKC - θ in the mutant ( Fig . 6C ) . To assess how changes in the redox status affect T cell 261 signaling we used buthionine sulphoximine ( BSO ) , an inhibitor of ɣ - glutamyl - cysteine 262 synthetase , which is essential for glutathione synthesis . Treatment with BSO increases the 263 oxidative burden in cells without directly affecting the thioredoxin system . Here , it initially 264 reverted the phospho - PKC - θ levels in the mutant to be comparable with wild - type , followed 265 by a slower TCR - activation - dependent phosphorylation ( Fig . 6C ) . Next , we investigated how 266 13 differential signaling was affecting the proteome signature using sorted CD4 + T cells from 267 wild - type and PTPN22 C129S mice . Mass spectrometric proteomics analysis of activated cells 268 revealed differential expression of multiple genes under both untreated and BSO - treated 269 conditions : Up - regulation of Nudt16l1 [ 18 , 19 ] , Clic4 [ 26 ] , Mgmt [ 27 ] , Hsp [ 28 ] , Serpina1e [ 29 ] 270 and Fscn1 [ 30 ] as well as down - regulation of Fuca1 [ 31 ] and Rps6kb1 [ 32 ] have all been shown 271 to be associated with increased PKC signaling ( Fig . 6D ) . 272 Thus , PTPN22 C129S that is prone to inactivation by oxidation with decreased catalytic activity 273 results in enhanced T cell signaling , which has broad signaling effects that can yield aggravated 274 inflammatory disease . 275 276 Discussion 277 In this study we investigated whether redox regulation of PTPN22 has an impact on 278 inflammation and autoimmune arthritis . We found that the C129S mutation in Ptpn22 leads 279 to reduced catalytic activity and increased susceptibility to oxidative inactivation in vitro , 280 causing concomitant upregulation of T - cell activation and T - cell - mediated autoimmunity in a 281 NOX2 - dependent manner . 282 Redox regulation describes the modulation of signaling pathways by oxidation and reduction , 283 the effects of which must always be considered in relation to enzymatically driven oxidative 284 and reductive pathways , and the signaling properties of redox - modified cellular targets 285 [ 33 ] [ 34 ] . Significant ROS producers include the membrane - bound NADPH oxidase ( NOX ) 286 complexes as well as the mitochondrial respiratory chain , modulating responses such as cell 287 growth , death and immune function under both physiological and pathological conditions 288 [ 35 ] 38 ] . The interplay between redox signaling and the immune response is complex and 289 14 multi - faceted . The protective effects of ROS against inflammatory diseases in vivo is best 290 evidenced in the Ncf1 m1J mouse where diminished ROS leads to exacerbated inflammation in 291 arthritis and lupus models [ 18 ] [ 37 ] . In T cells , ROS , most likely derived from NOX2 expressing 292 antigen presenting cells have been shown to regulate NFAT activation , IL2 production and 293 plasticity by both influencing the redox status of kinases involved as well as through metabolic 294 reprogramming [ 8 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] . The list of intracellular signaling molecules regulated by ROS is 295 long : transcription factors such as Nrf2 / Keap1 , NF - kB , HIF - 1a , AP - 1 as well as key TCR 296 downstream mediators such as MAPK / ERK , LCK , Zap70 , LAT , PKC - θ and PLC γ 1 are all redox - 297 sensitive [ 40 ] . The impact of the thioredoxin - and glutathione - dependent reductive systems 298 on these signaling pathways is also of crucial importance [ 34 ] [ 41 ] . 299 Reversible cysteine modifications have emerged as a major redox regulatory mechanism 300 important for ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , calcium flux , cell growth , and proliferation of naïve 301 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 42 ] . Proteins containing cysteine residues , such as protein tyrosine 302 phosphatases ( PTPs ) , are particularly susceptible to redox effects in part due to the low pKa 303 value of their active site . Oxidation leads to inhibition of PTP activity and several PTPs such as 304 Src homology region 2 domain - containing phosphatase - 1 and 2 ( SHP1 / 2 ) and tyrosine - protein 305 phosphatase non - receptor type 1 ( PTP1B ) are well studied in terms of their redox regulation 306 [ 9 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] . Again , the balance between oxidative and reductive pathways is crucial for 307 overall PTP activities and in this context the thioredoxin system is important for its reductive 308 PTP - activating capacity [ 13 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] . 309 PTPN22 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase expressed in all hematopoietic cells and a known 310 negative regulator of T cell signaling . The R620W variant of PTPN22 has been associated with 311 an increased risk of several autoimmune diseases , amongst them diabetes , rheumatoid 312 15 arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus . It has been shown to interfere with the binding 313 of PTPN22 to the C - terminal SRC kinase ( CSK ) affecting downstream signaling . However , 314 whether R620W is a gain - of - function or loss - of - function variant remains controversial 315 [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 48 ] . A possibility for redox regulation of PTPN22 was highlighted by Tsai et al . who 316 discovered an atypical disulfide bond formation between the catalytic cysteine C227 and a 317 “back - door” cysteine C129 , as visualized in a crystal structure of the catalytic domain of 318 PTPN22 [ 10 ] . As physiologically relevant oxidative regulation of PTPN22 has thus far not been 319 studied , we decided to mutate C129 into a serine , thereby abrogating the capacity of C129 to 320 contribute to redox regulation of PTPN22 , both in vitro and in vivo . 321 In our in vitro experiments , PTPN22 C129S showed a lower basal catalytic activity , higher 322 sensitivity to inhibition by oxidation , and a lower capacity for reactivation by the thioredoxin 323 system , compared to the wildtype enzyme . The reason behind the initial drop in activity 324 remains to be studied ; the single cysteine - to - serine change may affect the PTPN22 protein 325 conformation or dynamics and crystallography studies would be needed to address this . It 326 should also be noted that the pure PTPN22 C129S migrated slightly slower than wild - type 327 PTPN22 , despite the only difference between the two proteins being the single C129 residue . 328 This also suggests an overall effect on protein characteristics by the C129S mutation , which 329 should be studied further . Based on our findings , we propose a model for the redox regulation 330 of PTPN22 , with the disulfide bond that can be formed between C227 and C129 protecting the 331 catalytic C227 residue from overoxidation to sulphinic or sulphonic acid . It is also possible that 332 an alternative sulphenylamide motif can be made between the thiol group of the C227 with 333 the peptide bond amine , which can also be reduced by the thioredoxin system , similar to that 334 seen with PTP1B [ 13 ] [ 14 ] even if that motif was not seen in the crystal structure of PTPN22 335 [ 10 ] . This model explains how PTPN22 C129S can still show activity and a certain protection 336 16 against oxidation and reactivation by the thioredoxin system , but simultaneously be more 337 susceptible to oxidation because the protective disulfide cannot be formed . 338 In T cells , the PTPN22 C129S mutation led to enhanced T cell activation and proliferation . This 339 was not due to altered PTPN22 expression levels , but rather a consequence of downstream 340 signaling . The PTPN22 targets LCK , Fyn and Zap70 showed increased phosphorylation , arguing 341 for lower catalytic activity of PTPN22 C129S in vivo and confirming our in vitro findings . In TCR 342 signaling , phosphorylation of PKC - θ is a late - stage event that leads to the activation of 343 transcription factors Nf - Kb , NFAT and AP - 1 controlling T cell functions down the line [ 49 ] . We 344 observed baseline upregulation of p - PKC - θ in PTPN22 C129S T cells which did not respond to 345 further TCR stimulation . PKC phosphorylation is regulated by GLK ( germinal center kinase - like 346 kinase ) and LCK [ 49 ] – [ 51 ] . An increase in LCK phosphorylation as previously observed might 347 therefore be causing increased p - PKC - θ . In an oxidative mi croenvironment created by BSO 348 treatment , the initial difference in unstimulated cells disappeared and PTPN22 C129S instead 349 showed slower phosphorylation kinetics compared to wild - type . This might be mediated by 350 direct effects of ROS on PKC as it contains several redox - sensitive residues that can lead to 351 PKC inactivation [ 52 ] . Proteomics data further corroborated the enhanced activation state . 352 Interestingly , in the Ptpn22 mutant , we observed down - regulation of CENPF , a cell cycle 353 protein that was shown to be upregulated upon TrxR inhibition [ 53 ] . 354 Enhanced T cell activation led to increased inflammation in vivo and we observed a 355 pronounced skewing towards Th1 responses . A link between PTPN22 and Th1 responses has 356 previously been established ; PTPN22 - / - and PTPN22 R619W mice accumulate Th1 effector cells in 357 their lymphoid organs with age or upon immune challenge . Th1 expansion in these mice was 358 found to be dependent on LFA - ICAM1 interactions [ 54 ] . A collagen - induced arthritis ( CIA ) 359 17 model produced no visible differences in inflammation in PTPN22 C129S mice , in line with 360 previous data showing that even a complete lack of PTPN22 does not result in significant 361 differences in inflammation ( Supp . Fig . 3D ) [ 54 ] . An explanation could be that the major 362 pathogenic factor in the CIA model are autoreactive B cells producing pathogenic antibodies , 363 rather than autoreactive T cells [ 55 ] . 364 In both T cell mediated inflammatory models ( DTH and GPI ) as well as on the COL2 - T cell 365 transgenic background , PTPN22 C129S mice displayed higher T cell activity as well as more 366 regulatory T cell markers such as FOXP3 and PD1 ( shown for GPI model ) . A rise in Treg numbers 367 is a measure to combat inflammation , but where they originate from is a matter of discussion . 368 They can originate from the thymus and migrate to the tissue in response to inflammation or 369 result from conversion of CD4 + CD25 - naïve T cells in the periphery [ 56 ] . PTPN22 plays an 370 important role in determining TCR signal strength during central tolerance ; PTPN22 - deficient 371 mice show increased positive selection in the thymus as well as increased Treg numbers both 372 in the thymus and periphery leading to protection from the experimental autoimmune 373 encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) model of autoimmunity [ 18 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] . In our study , Treg numbers 374 were comparable between wild - type and PTPN22 C129S thymi , suggesting peripheral induction 375 of Tregs upon inflammation in PTPN22 C129S mice . This may be a consequence of increased IFN ɣ 376 production by PTPN22 C129S T cells as studies have also associated FOXP3 induction to Th1 377 responses ; this mechanism links IFN ɣ and IL27 with amplifying TGF - b - induced FOXP3 378 expression via STAT1 [ 61 ] [ 62 ] . Previous studies have also shown the essential role of PKC - θ in 379 NFAT - dependent FOXP3 expression . PKC - θ − / − mice have significantly reduced CD4 + FOXP3 + 380 Tregs in the thymus , spleen and lymph nodes [ 51 ] . Accordingly , the rise in Tregs in PTPN22 C129S 381 mice may be a consequence of the enhanced baseline PKC - θ signaling . 382 18 In summary , our results show how the activity of PTPN22 , a gene where a risk variant is 383 associated with autoimmune diseases , can be regulated by ROS through its non - catalytic C129 384 residue , which is likely to have a major impact on its function in addition to that of merely 385 altered basal turnover ( Fig . 6D ) . It has been notoriously difficult to target PTPs in vivo with drug 386 therapies due to the nature of their active sites [ 61 ] , but recent advances in targeting the 387 redox status of T lymphocytes might represent a novel strategy to treat T - cell - driven diseases . 388 Antibody - trapping of the oxidized form of PTP1B , a highly touted drug target for diabetes and 389 obesity , has been shown to increase insulin signaling in vitro [ 6 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] . It is therefore of 390 importance to study the redox regulatory effects on the T cell machinery and its effects on 391 immune processes . As such , our study contributes to the understanding of redox regulation 392 of PTPN22 and possibly represents a new avenue for targeting PTPN22 . 393 Materials and Methods 394 Recombinant expression of PTPN22 The open reading frame of human PTPN22 catalytic 395 domain ( 1 - 303 residues ) , codon optimized for recombinant expression in E . coli , was 396 synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies , Inc . The ORF was subcloned into an in - house 397 developed pD441b plasmid ( pD441b - HsPTPN22cd ) that generates a fusion protein of His6 - 398 sfGFP - SUMO - HsPTPN22cd , where His6 is an N - terminal His - tag for IMAC purification , sfGPF 399 ( superfolder GFP , [ 64 ] ) included for enhanced protein folding , solubility and direct visibility , 400 and SUMO ( small ubiquitin - related modifier ) being a 110 residue sequence recognized by 401 SUMO protease ULP1 that hydrolyzes the peptide bond at the C - terminus of the SUMO 402 domain , resulting in release of the target HsPTPN22cd from its N - terminal fusion partner . The 403 C129S mutation of human PTPN22 was introduced into the wild - type PTPN22 - encoding 404 plasmid pD441b - HsPTPN22cd by PCR using primer pairs HsPTPN22 - C129S - fwd 405 19 ( GATCGGTCTCATGGCGAGCATGGAGTACGAGATGGG ) and HsPTPN22 - C129S - rev 406 ( GATCGGTCTCCGCCATAACAATGATCAGTAC ) , and the resulting plasmid was named pD441b - 407 HsPTPN22cd - C129S . Both plasmids were respectively transformed into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) strain 408 for propagation and protein expression . The full sequences of the open reading frames of the 409 constructs for the wild - type PTPN22cd and its C129S mutant were verified by sequencing 410 ( Eurofins Biotech ) . Briefly , for each protein expression and purification , a 40 mL overnight 411 culture was inoculated into 2L terrific broth ( TB ) medium containing 50 µg / mL kanamycin in a 412 5L - bottle placed on a shaking incubator at 37 °C . Four hours after the inoculation , the 413 incubator temperature was lowered to 25 °C and 0 . 5 mM IPTG was added to induce protein 414 expression overnight . The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation , suspended in IMAC 415 binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 ) and lysed by 416 sonication . The soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation and purified by applying a 417 HisPrep FF 16 / 10 column used with an ÄKTA explorer FPLC system ( Cytiva Life Sciences ) . The 418 eluted and purified fusion protein was subsequently treated with an in - house expressed and 419 purified His - tagged ULP1 ( 1 % w / v ) and the cleavage solution was again re - applied onto the 420 HisPrep FF 16 / 10 column for separation of non - tagged target protein from its N - terminal His - 421 tagged fusion partner as well as from the His - tagged ULP1 . The target protein was then 422 concentrated , buffer exchanged and stored in the freezer . The purity of the product was 423 greater than 95 % as assessed by SDS - PAGE . 424 PTP activity assay PTP activity of recombinant wild - type PTPN22 and PTPN22 C129S ( 1400nM ) 425 was measured spectrophotometrically using as substrate 15mM chromogenic p - nitrophenyl 426 phosphate ( pNPP ) ( P4744 - 1G , Sigma - Aldrich ) , as described previously [ 65 ] . The absorbance 427 increase rates were measured at 410 nm at 22 °C using an Infinite M200 Pro plate reader 428 20 ( Tecan ) . Reduced PTPN22 ( 1400nM , 49 . 9μg / ml ) was preincubated in 20 mM HEPES , 0 . 1mM 429 diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and 100 mM NaCl buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 0 . 05 % BSA 430 to prevent PTPN22 from time - dependent inactivation [ 11 ] together with 1 mM sodium azide . 431 Sodium azide was used to inhibit any trace amounts of catalase . At the indicated 432 concentrations human Trx1 , TrxR1 and NADPH ( N7505 - 100MG , Sigma - Aldrich ) were added 433 ( with Trx1 and TrxR1 expressed and purified as described in [ 66 ] . Variations in activity were 434 observed between different batches of PTP purifications , and activities were thus always 435 compared with the controls within each experiment . 436 PTP treatment with H 2 O 2 and bicarbonate Pre - reduced and desalted PTPN22 was exposed to 437 H 2 O 2 and different components of the Trx system at the indicated time points followed by the 438 addition of pNPP and measurement of activity . The activity after each H 2 O 2 treatment was 439 related to the activity of untreated PTPN22 incubated for the same time . For analysis of the 440 effects of bicarbonate , similarly pre - reduced PTPN22 ( 1400nM ) was pre - incubated in 20mM 441 HEPES , 100 mM NaCl buffer , pH 7 . 4 , containing 0 . 1mM EDTA , 0 . 05 % BSA . For treatment with 442 oxidant , bicarbonate and H 2 O2 were premixed in the same buffer before addition to PTPN22 443 for treatment . Each PTPN22 in reaction mixture was exposed for the indicated times to H 2 O 2 444 with or without bicarbonate ( pH 7 . 4 ) and subsequent to this treatment , measurement of PTP 445 activity was performed . 446 PTP reactivation assay PTPs from stock storage solutions were exchanged into reactivation 447 buffer as described previously [ 67 ] containing 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Tween 80 . Subsequently the PTPs 448 were inactivated by treatment with 1 mM H 2 O 2 for 5 min at 25°C . Following this inactivation 449 incubation , 20 μg / ml catalase was added to quench excess H 2 O 2 whereafter the reactivation 450 experiment was performed by adding the components of the Trx system as indicated . 451 21 Animals 452 Establishment of mouse strains 453 Vector construction A genomic fragment encompassing exon 2 to 10 of the Ptpn22 gene was 454 isolated from a BAC clone of C57BL / 6 origin ( n° RP23 - 189D14 , Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum 455 f ü r Genomforschung ) . The TGT codon found in exon 5 of the Ptpn22 gene and coding for the 456 cysteine residue present at position 129 of PTPN22 was converted into a TCC codon coding 457 for a serine . A lox P - tACE - CRE - PGK - gb2 - neo r - lox P cassette ( NEO ; [ 68 ] ) was introduced in the 458 intron separating exons 5 and 6 of the Ptpn22 gene , and a cassette coding for the diphtheria 459 toxin fragment A abutted to the 5’ end of the targeting vector . 460 Isolation of recombinant ES clones . After electroporation of Bruce 4 C57BL / 6 ES cells [ 69 ] and 461 selection in G418 , colonies were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot . A 462 probe specific for the NEO cassette was also used to ensure that adventitious non - 463 homologous recombination events had not occurred in the selected ES clones . 464 Production of Mutant Mice . Mice were handled in accordance with national and European 465 laws for laboratory animal welfare and experimentation ( EEC Council Directive 2010 / 63 / EU , 466 September 2010 ) , and protocols approved by the Marseille Ethical Committee for Animal 467 Experimentation . Mutant Ptpn22 C129S ES cells were injected into FVB blastocysts . Germline 468 transmission led to the self - excision of the NEO selection cassette in male germinal cells . 469 Presence of the intended mutation was checked in homozygous Ptpn22 C129S mice by DNA 470 sequencing . Screening of mice for the presence of the Ptpn22 C129S mutation was performed 471 by PCR using the following oligonucleotides : 5’ - CATGCAGGACTGTCCTCTCT - 3’ and 5’ - 472 GTATTCTTGTCTCCCTTCCT - 3’ . This pair of primers amplifies a 283 b p band in the case of the 473 wild - type allele and a 368 bp band in the case of the Ptpn22 C129S allele . Mice harboring the 474 22 Ptpn22 C129S mutation have received the international strain designation C57BL / 6 - 475 Ptpn22 tm1Ciphe , and founders were sent to Karolinska for further experiments . 476 The mice were backcrossed to C57Bl6 / N . H2 q ( B6Q ) mice . This genetic background was used in 477 all experiments . In some experiments we introgressed a TCR VDJ beta knock in as well as a 478 TCR alpha locus originally derived from the DBA / 1 mouse [ 70 ] . For other experiments , the 479 Ncf1 m1j mutation was inserted , leading to a functional impairment of the NOX2 mediated ROS 480 response [ 71 ] . Mice were kept under specific pathogen free ( SPF ) conditions in the animal 481 house of the Section for Medical Inflammation Research , Karolinska Institute in Stockholm . 482 Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages containing wood shavings in a climate - 483 controlled environment with a 14 h light - dark cycle , fed with standard chow and water ad 484 libitum . All mice were healthy and basic physiological parameters were not affected . All the 485 experiments were performed with age - , and sex - matched mice and in a blinded fashion . 486 Experimental procedures were approved by the ethical committees in Stockholm , Sweden . 487 Ethical permit numbers : 12923 / 18 and N134 / 13 ( genotyping and serotyping ) , N35 / 16 ( DTH , 488 GPI , CIA ) . 489 Delayed Type Hypersensitivity ( DTH ) . 12 - week old mice were sensitized by intradermal 490 injection of 100ug rat collagen type II ( COL2 ) in 100ul of a 1 : 1 emulsion with Complete 491 Freund’s adjuvant ( BD , Difco , MI , USA ) and 10mM acetic acid at the base of the tail . Day 8 492 after sensitization the right ear was injected intradermally with 10ul COL2 in PBS ( 1mg / ml ) 493 whilst the control left ear was injected with 10ul acetic acid in PBS . Ear swelling response was 494 measured 0h , 24h , 48 and 72 hours after challenge using a caliper . Change in ear thickness 495 was calculated by subtracting the swelling of the PBS - injected ear from the swelling of the 496 COL2 - injected ear normalized to day 0 thickness . Ear tissue was processed according to [ 72 ] . 497 23 GPI - induced arthritis ( GPI ) . Arthritis was induced by the hGPIc - c peptide ( NH2 - 498 IWYINCFGCETHAML - OH ; Biomatik ) emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund’s 499 adjuvant . Each mouse was intradermally injected with 100ul emulsion ( 10ug / mouse ) at the 500 base of the tail and arthritis development was monitored using a macroscopic scoring system 501 where visibly inflamed ankles or wrists received 5 points each and inflamed toes / fingers were 502 given 1 point . 503 Collagen - induced arthritis ( CIA ) . Arthritis was induced with 100 µg of heterologous rat COL2 504 in 100 µl of a 1 : 1 emulsion with CFA and 10mM acetic acid injected intradermally at the base 505 of the tail . Mice were challenged on day 28 with 50 µg of COL2 in 50 µl of IFA ( BD , Difco ) 506 emulsion . Arthritis development was monitored using a macroscopic scoring system as 507 described above . 508 Cell culture . 10 6 splenocytes or lymph node cells were cultured in 200 µl of complete DMEM 509 per well in U - shaped bottom 96 - well plates ( Thermo ) at 37°C and 5 % CO2 . Complete DMEM 510 consisted of : DMEM + Glutamax ( Gibco ) ; 5 % FBS ( Gibco ) ; 10 µM HEPES ( Sigma ) ; 50 µgml − 1 511 streptomycin sulfate ( Sigma ) ; 60 µgml − 1 penicillin C ( Sigma ) ; 50 µM beta - mercaptoethanol 512 ( Gibco ) .

Samples were combined , acidified by 594 trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ; Sigma ; Cat # 302031 - M ) , cleaned using Sep - Pak ( Waters ; 595 Cat # WAT054960 ) and dried using a DNA 120 SpeedVac™ concentrator ( Thermo ) . Samples 596 were then resuspended in 20mM ammonium hydroxide and separated into 96 fractions on an 597 XBrigde BEH C18 2 . 1 × 150 mm column ( Waters ; Cat # 186003023 ) , using a Dionex Ultimate 598 3000 2DLC system ( Thermo Scientific ) over a 48 min gradient of 1 – 63 % B ( B = 20 mM 599 ammonium hydroxide in acetonitrile ) in three steps ( 1 – 23 . 5 % B in 42 min , 23 . 5 – 54 % B in 4 min 600 and then 54 – 63 % B in 2 min ) at 200 µL min −1 flow . Fractions were then concatenated into 24 601 samples in sequential order ( e . g . 1 , 25 , 49 , 73 ) . After drying and resuspension in 0 . 1 % formic 602 acid ( FA ) ( Fisher Scientific ) , each fraction was analyzed with a 90 min gradient in random 603 order . 604 LC - MS analysis . Samples were loaded with buffer A ( 0 . 1 % FA in water ) onto a 50 cm EASY - 605 Spray column ( 75 µm internal diameter , packed with PepMap C18 , 2 µm beads , 100Å pore 606 size ) connected to a nanoflow Dionex UltiMate 3000 UPLC system ( Thermo ) and eluted in an 607 increasing organic solvent gradient from 4 to 28 % ( B : 98 % ACN , 0 . 1 % FA , 2 % H 2 O ) at a flow 608 rate of 300nLmin −1 . Mass spectra were acquired with an orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass 609 spectrometer ( Thermo ) in the data - dependent mode with MS1 scan at 120 , 000 resolution , 610 and MS2 a t 50 , 000 ( @ 200 m / z ) , in the mass range from 400 to 1600 m / z . Peptide 611 fragmentation was performed via higher - energy collision dissociation ( HCD ) with energy set 612 at 35 NCE . 613 28 Protein identification and quantification . The raw data from LC - MS were analyzed by 614 MaxQuant , version 1 . 6 . 2 . 3 [ 74 ] . The Andromeda engine [ 75 ] searched MS / MS data against 615 UniProt complete proteome database ( Mus musculus , version UP000000589 , 22 , 137 entries ) . 616 Cysteine carbamidomethylation was used as a fixed modification , while methionine oxidation 617 and protein N - terminal acetylation were selected as a variable modification . Trypsin / P was 618 selected as enzyme specificity . No more than two missed cleavages were allowed . A 1 % false 619 discovery rate was used as a filter at both protein and peptide levels . First search tolerance 620 was 20ppm ( default ) and main search tolerance was 4 . 5 ppm ( default ) , and the minimum 621 peptide length was 7 residues . After removing all the contaminants , only proteins with at least 622 two unique peptides were included in the final dataset . Protein abundances were normalized 623 by the total protein abundance in each sample in deep datasets . In the original dataset , 624 protein abundances were normalized to ensure same median abundance across all channels 625 in all replicates . Then for each protein log2 - transformed fold - changes were calculated as a 626 log2 - ratio of the intensity to the median of all control replicates . All the proteins quantified in 627 each experiment were used as the background . 628 Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v6 . 0 . Statistical 629 comparison of two unpaired groups was carried out using Mann - Whitney U non - parametric 630 test unless stated otherwise . Welch’s variant of the Student t - test was used in indicated 631 experiments . P - values under 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant and are denoted as 632 * ( p < 0 . 05 ) or * * ( p < 0 . 01 ) . 633 References 634 [ 1 ] J . Ye , K . M . Gillespie , and S .

( error bars ) ( n = 3 ) and activities are given as % of 891 buffer control for each enzyme . E ) Pre - reduced wild - type ( green ) and PTPN22 C129S ( orange ) proteins were first 892 preincubated for 10 min either in only buffer ( ■ ) , with 300μM NADPH and 0 . 25μM TrxR1 ( ▲ ) , with 300μM 893 NADPH , 0 . 25μM TrxR1 and 10μM Trx1 ( ▼ ) , or with 300μM NADPH , 0 . 25μM TrxR1 and 10μM Trp14 ( ◆ ) , 894 whereupon H 2 O 2 ( 100μM ) and 1mM NaN 3 was added , except to the control ( ● ) , and samples were taken at 895 indicated times for measurement of PTP activity .

A ) Pre - reduced wild - type ( black ) or PTPN22 C129S ( grey ) proteins were 899 treated with H 2 O 2 ( 1mM ) for 5 min whereupon residual H 2 O 2 was removed by addition of catalase . Thereafter , 900 the enzymes were incubated for 60 min at 37°C with either only buffer , DTT ( 10 mM ) , or with combinations of 901 TrxR1 ( 2 . 5μM ) and NADPH ( 300μM ) and Trx1 ( 10μM ) , as indicated . Finally , the samples were analyzed for PTP 902 activity , with activity reported as percentage of control samples treated identically but without addition of H 2 O 2 . 903 B ) Pre - reduced PTPN22 ( green ) and PTPN22 C129S ( orange ) were treated as described in A , reactivated with either 904 10mM DTT , or NADPH ( 300μM ) and different concentrations of TrxR1 as indicated . After 60 min at 37 °C , samples 905 were analyzed for PTP activity , given as turnover in min - 1 ( mol of product / mol of enzyme / min ) . C ) SDS - PAGE 906 analysis of PTPN22 or PTPN22 C129S treated similarly to the assay shown in A ) but incubated with H 2 O 2 ( 100µM ) , 907 DTT ( 10 mM ) or TrxR1 ( 0 . 5µM together with 300 µM NADPH ) , as indicated in the figure .

D ) A proposed model for redox regulation of PTPN22 . Only the 911 reduced form of the enzyme is active ( top , light green ) , which upon oxidation with H 2 O 2 and as further facilitated 912 by bicarbonate ( HCO 3 - ) can form several oxidized species ( bottom , purple ) , possibly being either a sulfenylamide 913 as suggested for PTP1B or some other species that require the complete thioredoxin system for reactivation 914 ( left ) , as well as irreversibly oxidized with the catalytic C227 converted to sulfinic / sulfonic acid ( middle ) , or by 915 forming a disulfide with C129 ( right ) . This disulfide was here found to be amenable to reduction directly by TrxR1 , 916 but as the PTPN22 C129S mutant cannot form this species , it can also not be reactivated by that reduction path 917 ( dashed green arrow ) . Both PTPN22 and PTPN22 C129S can however be reactivated by the thioredoxin system from 918 its other non - irreversibly oxidized states ( solid green arrow ) . 919 39 920 Fig . 3 : PTPN22 C129S enhances Th1 - mediated inflammation via NOX2 - mediated ROS .

E ) A proposed model for 986 redox regulation of PTPN22 in vivo : upon oxidative pressure within the cell C227 of PTPN22 forms a disulfide 987 bond with the back - door cysteine C129 as a means of protection from irreversible oxidation and inactivation . 988 When the C227 - C129 bond cannot be formed , as is the case in PTPN22 C129S mutant , PTPN22 is less sensitive to 989 reactivation by the thioredoxin system which leads to increased TCR signaling and inflammation .
