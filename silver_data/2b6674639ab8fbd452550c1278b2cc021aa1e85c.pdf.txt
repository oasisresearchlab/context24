Beaudry Abstract Inﬂuence of cognitive , geographical , and collaborative proximity on knowledge production of Canadian nanotechnology Elva Luz Crespo Neira We address the question of whether or not geographical , cognitive , and collaborative proximity have an impact on citation probability in the scientiﬁc writings of Canadian nanotechnology . Even though a number of studies in the proximity literature deal with the eﬀects of spatial distance , scientiﬁc specialization , and social network structure , to our knowledge no one has combined all three to explore the production of academic information . We generate a feature framework based on measurements from these factors , relying on statistical and classiﬁcation approaches to assess their inﬂuence on eﬀective citations . Speciﬁcally , by means of applying binary regression models along with tree - based machine learning algorithms , we found statistical signiﬁcance proving that these features have both a veriﬁable impact and predictive potential . Importantly , our work is the ﬁrst one that we have seen combining these techniques to infer the establishment of positive citation links . Moreover , we employed inductive network analysis comprehensively to examine the co - authorship links between authors publishing in nanoscience , considering additional network metrics to the ones usually adopted in the literature . Our ﬁndings reveal that cognitive proximity , closely followed by the collaborative aspect , are the most important elements inducing Canadian scholars to cite , with geography sometimes acting as their base . Our results enable us to reach better understanding related to the citation behavior of the nanoresearch community in Canada , making our work a valuable contribution to scholarly literature , also giving us ground to make policy recommendations . iii Acknowledgments This thesis is the ﬁnal product of a long journey that has been ﬁlled with learning and all kinds of challenges at every step of the way .

, that sometimes they are even used interchangeably . Science , however , entails formal processes for its creation , so we should rather call it structured knowledge . The use of existing knowledge is vital for innovating , discovering , and generating new ideas . Learning is also essential , since it involves gaining new knowledge , as well as sharing and exchanging it . Knowledge being the raw material , its production in terms of academic research and invention is key for the development of technology and sciences . Throughout this thesis , we will be focusing on one scientiﬁc ﬁeld in particular : nanotechnology , an emerging technology based on solid particles in the size range of 1 - 100 nm . Government organizations reported that investment targeted at its research and evolution increased worldwide over the past years , from roughly $ 432 million in 1997 to $ 4 . 1 billion in 2005 ( Yegul et al . , 2008 ) , ﬁgures which illustrate its potential for global economy . Developments and applications in this area over the past two decades have been dramatic , and will continue into the foreseeable future ( EPA , 2005 ) . Canada being one of the seven major advanced economies in the world , relevant investigations show that it is among the top countries producing nanotechnology research ( Yegul et al . , 2008 ) . Since research in general concerns the ﬂow and expansion of knowledge , we seek to ﬁnd out more about possible causes that could be behind knowledge production , driving and modeling its diﬀusion among the 1 scientiﬁc community . Moreover , we suggest that knowledge production in Canadian nanotechnology is inﬂuenced by three key proximity factors : Cognitive , geographical , and collaborative . Cognitive proximity refers to the closeness between scientiﬁc branches . Visualizing the interactions of scientists coming from diﬀerent knowledge ﬁelds or disciplines will prove helpful to get an overview of the level of interdisciplinarity , which is very important , considering the multidisciplinary nature of nanotechnology . The geographical or spatial proximity is perhaps the easiest concept to understand from all the proposed aspects , since it clearly alludes to physical distance . With the expansion and evolution of communication technologies nowadays , it is interesting to examine if distance still has weight to determine the feasibility or facilitate academic research , since it is well known that spatial separation is no longer an obstacle for information exchange ( Feldman , 2002 ) . With collaborative proximity , we aim to get a sense of how close scholars are to each other in terms of a co - authorship social network , as well as the importance of their position within the network . The idea is to examine the relationships between scientists and their attributes with respect to the whole network , and evaluate the cohesion level among individuals . In the present work , we propose to test the hypotheses that these proximities have both an observable impact and a predicting inﬂuence in knowledge production , in terms of academic citation probability . We consider that ﬁnding empirical evidence for this will be of interest to the scientiﬁc society , because it will contribute to explain how proximity factors aﬀect the resulting scholarly output . In addition , we seek to know if the importance of these elements lies within each factor separately , or if their eﬀect is based upon an existing interaction between them . Throughout the literature , we have a few examples of studies sharing some similarities to ours . However , they are geared towards innovation and economics , or rather focusing on other branches of science . Plus , they have been conducted either with considerably smaller databases , or inspecting proximity inﬂuence only at a macro level . At any rate , to our knowledge , there has been no analysis concerning all three proximity aspects together in nanotechnology research , nor in any other ﬁeld . Furthermore , none of these works address the establish - ment of citation links by means of both regression and classiﬁcation modeling . Thus , we expect the results from this thesis to be a good contribution in terms of its conclusions and the proposed methodology . 2 1 . 2 Objectives The main purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the importance of the aforementioned three key factors for the creation of knowledge in the area of nanotechnology in Canada : 1 . Cognitive proximity , 2 . Geographical proximity , and 3 . Collaborative proximity . With the results from this research , we aim to determine whether or not these aspects have an actual inﬂuence on research conducted by scholars . 1 . 3 Contributions We consider one of the major contributions of this work to be leading to a better understanding on the production of knowledge for Canadian nanotechnology , which can provide more guidance in terms of academic research . Particularly , to have an improved grasp on the dynamics , evolution , and structure of formal research conducted in this ﬁeld , focusing on the three distinctive aspects we have selected to analyze more in depth . We expect the results of our analysis to be encouraging for nanotechnology researchers , motivating them to pursue trans - disciplinary research , that is , making use of the best research ideas and methodologies from other ﬁelds . In addition , we anticipate that observable eﬀects from scholarly collaboration will drive institutions to promote the establishment of social connections in this academic domain . Policy makers shall also gain result - based evidence to support ﬁne - tuning of science and technology poli - cies that encourage multidisciplinary research teams . We anticipate that this study will provide supportive arguments for the creation of tools that will facilitate the expansion of research ﬁelds within Canada . 1 . 4 Organization This thesis is organized as follows : The “Literature Review” section provides an overview of the bibliography found relevant to the topic . Then follows a section that introduces the data and the methodology used in the diﬀerent stages of our work . The “Results” section presents the outcome of the various analysis techniques applied to the data , followed by a discussion on their signiﬁcance and an account of the limitations found . Finally , the last section concludes by presenting a summary on the ﬁndings of this research , while also making suggestions for future research opportunities emerging from our analysis . 3 CHAPTER 2 Literature Review 2 . 1 Nanotechnology research in Canada We set the background for this thesis by taking a brief look at the development of nanotechnology , an emerging technology based on solid particles in the size range of 1 - 100 nm ( see Yegul et al . , 2008 , p . 1 ) , with special consideration in its knowledge production at the hands of Canadian scholars . According to Delemarle et al . ( 2009 ) , scientiﬁc publications in this area have substantially increased since the last decade of the 1990s ( 12 % per year from 1998 to 2006 ) , with nanoscience programs ﬂourishing throughout the world . Furthermore , nanotechnology is a ﬁeld where the involvement of academic research is preeminent . With universities as an important source for its knowledge generation and even innovative activities , nanotechnology appears to rely on sciences to a higher degree than other technology ﬁelds ( Wang and Guan , 2011 ) . As mentioned previously , Canada is one of the top countries producing scientiﬁc literature in nanotech - nology ( Yegul et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , Canadian nanotechnology inventors show an increasing tendency to collaborate more closely with researchers on the ﬁeld ( Beaudry and Schiﬀauerova , 2011 ) . This scenario would then be ideal for knowledge production , given that the dynamics of such collaboration results in greater information sharing , in turn favoring its diﬀusion among the scientiﬁc community . However , since this technology requires sustained investment along with favorable conditions , nanotech - nology does not thrive just anywhere , nor is it spread uniformly around the globe ( Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) . 4 The context of this study is nanotechnology , which makes for a particularly good setting to study knowl - edge ﬂows and the role of proximity inﬂuences ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . Thus , we shall now take a look into the concepts of academic knowledge , aiming to better understand what elements play a major role to constitute a favorable environment for the knowledge production in nanotechnology , as measured by attributes of scholarly publications . 2 . 2 Knowledge diﬀusion Knowledge is deﬁned by Howells ( 2002 ) as a dynamic framework from which information can be stored , processed , and understood . The sharing of learned knowledge is essential for innovation to take place , going hand in hand with academic research ( Moodysson and Jonsson , 2007 ) . We could interpret this mutual exchange of knowledge and shared learning as meaning that knowledge is intrinsically a socially constructed process ( Berger and Luckmann , 1991 ) . Extensive literature associates social networks as the pathways that channel the ﬂow of knowledge among actors ( Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . When evaluating some properties and the structure of networks itself , it is well documented that they have a decisive inﬂuence on the spread of knowledge ( Eslami et al . , 2013 ) . If we go a step further , and focus on the realm of scientiﬁc communication , it is unquestionable that individuals are connected in intellectual and social networks shaped by formal and informal channels through which knowledge ﬂows ( Marion et al . , 2003 ) . Marion et al . ( 2003 ) also emphasize that these studies , when applied to scientiﬁc communities , have re - vealed their capacity for analyzing and understanding the growth and diﬀusion of information . Consequently , research on collaboration and knowledge ﬂows has just recently started to be applied to areas of emerging technology ( Eslami et al . , 2013 ) . This is particularly relevant , if we consider science as an “epistemic com - munity” , which means that the sole objective of its members is the production of knowledge ( Gittelman , 2007 ) . Considering the key role that the knowledge ﬂow plays in a wide variety of ﬁelds ( Rogers , 2010 ) , the processes involved in its diﬀusion have spurred investigation since way back , with most of the work originating from the ﬁeld of Sociology ( e . g . Valente and Rogers , 1995 ; Zinkhan et al . , 1992 ; Baber , 1992 ; Shapin , 1995 ) . Moreover , the dynamics , evolution , and direction of these knowledge ﬂows have been the aim of analysts who seek to visualize and document the patterns of the relationships involved ( Marion et al . , 2003 ) , as well as discerning their inﬂuencing factors . 5 2 . 3 Proximity Factors 2 . 3 . 1 Deﬁning Proximity As mentioned above , social networks are the highways for knowledge diﬀusion . These networks are usually formed according to typical characteristics such as gender , ethnicity , age , education level , and so on , following people’s tendency to group together with individuals they have something in common . This similarity of attributes is called homophily by sociologists , but we shall rather use the terminology of proximity , since it is more common when studying scientiﬁc areas and innovation ( Boschma and Frenken , 2010 ) . Gilly and Torre ( 2000 ) deﬁne proximity as the existing interactions between actors , following the school of thought from the French Proximity Dynamics group , formed by a collection of industrial and spatial economists . Since the early 1990s , this group took the lead in a worldwide research movement who collabo - rated to show the concepts of convergence and coherence under the light of new approaches in economic space ( Shaw and Gilly , 2000 ) . Their purpose was to study proximity and explain the nature of its eﬀects within an organization setting . The book by Rallet et al . ( 1995 ) brings together the ﬁndings of this association , in which they mention that proximity is an important variable that aﬀects human activities , whether as cause or consequence . The interest given to the notion of proximity since then has inspired further investigation by scholars coming from multiple disciplines , since clearly this concept cannot be solely limited to the context of eco - nomics ( Shaw and Gilly , 2000 ) . Even though there is as yet little understanding of how it aﬀects innovation over time ( Boschma , 2005 ) , proximity is considered to be an inﬂuencing factor for knowledge ﬂows in sci - ence . Notably , former research on nanotechnology suggests that proximity plays a signiﬁcant role in the understanding of collaboration and development in this area ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . Speaking in terms of the scientiﬁc network , a certain degree of proximity is required to make the actors or agents connected to actually form the network itself . Furthermore , in the literature it is frequently argued that an increasing proximity leads to more interaction between actors , leading them in turn to learn and innovate more . However , Boschma ( 2005 ) takes a critical stand on this , by putting to question the virtues of proximity . Boschma and Frenken ( 2010 ) call it the proximity paradox , which states that whereas too little proximity will prevent interactive learning and innovation from happening , too much will also be harmful for these purposes . Hence , an optimal level of proximity between agents needs to be reached and not surpassed , to avoid negative impacts on their academic and innovative performance , due to the lack of openness and ﬂexibility ( Boschma , 2005 ; Broekel and Meder , 2008 ) . We shall see more details about the potential risks related to degree of proximity when we go through the concerning dimensions further on . Proximity is a somewhat “elastic” notion ( Moodysson and Jonsson , 2007 ) , and its deﬁnition and the 6 number of its diﬀerent dimensions vary among authors , since there are non - tangible aspects to be considered . Still , they agree that it is essential to clarify them in a framework that avoids overlap as much as possible , so the eﬀects of each dimension can be isolated and analyzed separately . The proximity dimensions found in the literature are discussed in the next section . 2 . 3 . 2 Proximity Types Proximity has been historically associated with location , starting with von Th¨unen ( 1826 ) , who studied its advantages in the context of urban and agricultural activities ( Gilly and Torre , 2000 ) . Nevertheless , various scholars amplify the meaning of proximity , since it clearly goes beyond a geographical connotation ( Boschma , 2005 ) . Refer to Table 1 to see a compendium of the proximity categories or dimensions that have been identiﬁed by major authors in the subject ( Gilly and Torre , 2000 ; Zeller , 2004 ; Boschma , 2005 ; Moodysson and Jonsson , 2007 ) . As we can see , there is , in some cases , wide conceptual variation between the categories proposed . Gilly and Torre ( 2000 ) Zeller ( 2004 ) Boschma ( 2005 ) Moodysson and Jonsson ( 2007 ) Geographical Spatial Geographical Functional Organizational Organizational Organizational Institutional Institutional Technological Cognitive Cultural Social Relational Relational Virtual Table 1 : Proximity dimension frameworks Source : Modiﬁed based on Moodysson and Jonsson ( 2007 , p . 6 ) The key contribution from the French School of Proximity Dynamics consisted in proposing for the ﬁrst time that proximity covers a number of dimensions . They analyzed innovation processes from the perspective of the interface between the space economy and the industrial economy ( Gilly and Torre , 2000 ) . Among the primary elements of their research were competition conditions at local levels , innovation and technological change dimensions , and the involvement of externalities . Within the setting of economics , externalities ( also called spill - overs ) are unintended side eﬀects caused by an economic activity , meaning that there is no actual payment involved for these externalities to happen . Thus , we have the ﬁrst categorization for proximity by this group , in terms of geographical and orga - nizational proximity . Since we will go more in depth about the diﬀerent approaches towards geographical proximity in a next section , we focus now on organizational proximity . It basically follows two ideas : simi - larity and adherence , referring respectively to either being part of the same relational framework , or sharing common knowledge and skills . 7 Conversely , the study performed by Zeller ( 2004 ) extends proximity dimensionality by adding ﬁve more categories on top of those already mentioned . His study was geared towards the pharmaceutical industry , and he speciﬁed the categories of spatial , organizational , institutional , cultural , relational , technological , and virtual proximity . In this case , geographical proximity is named spatial proximity , and the organizational proximity keeps one of the logics from the French Proximity Dynamics crew , the similarity aspect . Zeller gives more emphasis on the organization as a corporate unit , with its own set of rules and identity . The adherence logic is addressed in two separate dimensions : institutional and cultural proximities . Institutional proximity refers to the collection of practices , laws , and rules deﬁned by the geographical setting , that is , within a country or region . These elements are involved in the evolution of political power relations that contribute to a cultural aﬃnity ( Zeller , 2004 ) that inﬂuences , shapes , and constrains interac - tions between actors ( Kirat and Lung , 1999 ) . Having a correlation to this dimension , cultural proximity is based on a shared cultural background , and the consequent norms of behavior between innovative actors and researchers . It implicates as well the expected factors in social relationships , such as culture , language , and trust . However , personal relationships per se are studied by this author in the relational proximity , which is inﬂuenced by the cultural dimension , but focuses on the informal structures that facilitate knowledge transfer ( Zeller , 2004 ) . Technological proximity is , of course , related to technology , in terms of the sharing of its knowledge bases , experiences , and infrastructure in general . It is key for innovation to occur , because people in the ﬁeld that are technologically proximate , can contribute with their respective ﬁndings , developments , and know - how ( Zeller , 2004 ) . Sometimes , a sectoral proximity is used , which relates to the industrial distribution of innovative activity , and it is closely related to technological proximity ( Maggioni and Uberti , 2009 ) , however it does not form part of a bigger proximity categorization . The last dimension conceptualized in Zeller’s framework is the virtual proximity , which results from the use of ICT ( Information and Communications Technology ) . Shortly after the categorization by Zeller ( 2004 ) , Boschma ( 2005 ) introduced his model of proximity classiﬁcation in ﬁve dimensions : cognitive , organizational , social , institutional , and geographical . Similarly to Zeller’s relational dimension , social proximity deals with the ties among individuals in a social context , that is , it looks into the relations between agents in a micro - level . In the same fashion , Boschma also separates the cultural aspects of proximity , associating them to the notion of institutional proximity , which studies factors in agents at a macro - level . An institution in this context is not used as a synonym to company or ﬁrm , rather cultural elements like ethnics , beliefs , language , etc . are considered to be informal institutions , and laws and regulations would be formal institutions ( Boschma , 2005 ) . Coming from the ﬁeld of economic geography , the model by Boschma ( 2005 ) was also built on top of the work from the French research team , but diﬀering to some extent , particularly for the organizational 8 dimension , which is not as broadly deﬁned as by the French scholars . Instead , organizational proximity is delimited for relations inside or between ﬁrms , and for analytical reasons , the partaking in the same knowledge ﬁeld is isolated as a new type : the cognitive dimension , which we will address in a further section . As the most recent of these academic publications , Moodysson and Jonsson ( 2007 ) take a critical stance on previous works . Despite the French proximity framework ( Gilly and Torre , 2000 ) being a noteworthy contribution for deﬁning non - tangible aspects of proximity , its vague categorization would impede real ap - plicability ( Moodysson and Jonsson , 2007 , p . 5 ) . Nonetheless , they likewise take into consideration only two proximity dimensions , since according to their perspective , the models by Zeller ( 2004 ) and Boschma ( 2005 ) do not provide a consistent framework for empirical studies , due to the overlapping in their dimension categories . In spite of this assessment , they largely base their own work on these two contributions , since they were viewed as analytically sharper in deﬁning the non - tangible aspects of proximity . As a result , two categories were described : functional and relational proximity , in the context of biotech - nology innovation projects in Sweden ( Moodysson and Jonsson , 2007 ) . Relational proximity , based on aﬃnity and similarity , is close to the proposed organizational dimension from Gilly and Torre ( 2000 ) , yet it is diﬀer - ent in that the two logics ( adherence and similarity ) are seen as the same , or rather , one is the cause of the other . Finally , functional proximity is introduced , combining key concepts from the geographical dimension . Sometimes it is argued that the list of dimensions can be extended , without aﬀecting the meaning of a dimension itself ( Boschma and Frenken , 2010 ) . Such could be the case for splitting sub - factors , like religious or linguistic as their own proximity dimension . Boschma and Frenken ( 2010 ) claim that proximity dimensions are analytically orthogonal , or independent , even though many dimensions of proximity may empirically overlap and turn out to be correlated or mutually dependent ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . For instance , institutional proximity between two agents could be inﬂuenced by geographical proximity . It could imply that the cultural gap within short distances is smaller , with individuals pertaining to the same town or country . Overall , we see that even though there are some discrepancies towards the number of proximity dimensions between scholars , the factors to contemplate are common in each of their studies . Rather , they sometimes rename , or just either separate into several , or merge diverse aspects in one dimension . For the purpose of explaining and understanding how connections are encouraged into the formation of networks , it is useful to count with a framework constituted by multiple proximity dimensions . Boschma ( 2005 ) aﬃrms that in the context of innovation networks , proximity dimensions are substitutes rather than complements . Hence , at least one dimension is required to establish a successful connection , but if more than one is involved , it adds little to the probability of said connection to be successful or established in the ﬁrst place . In essence , proximity is mandatory to build networks that will allow knowledge diﬀusion resulting in learning or innovation , though not every dimension must be involved to arrange the connections . We base 9 on the scheme deﬁned by Boschma ( 2005 ) , and consider two categories from it : geographical and cognitive proximity . We have reviewed and put into context the frameworks into which these dimensions are situated . So , we shall now go in depth to explain the various approaches taken by several scholars when delimiting these dimensions and its implications . 2 . 3 . 3 Cognitive Proximity Cognitive Proximity can be deﬁned as the shared knowledge base and expertise of diﬀerent entities , labeled sometimes as actors , and by Cunningham and Werker ( 2012 ) as agents . Given this deﬁnition for this category , one could argue that the concept is similar to Zeller’s ( 2004 ) technological proximity , because it relates to the sharing of knowledge bases and experiences . However , we could say that a cognitive ﬁeld is a broader concept than a technological area , which is why sometimes technological proximity has been deﬁned as a subset of cognitive proximity . Boschma ( 2005 , p . 63 ) features the importance of cognitive proximity for enabling agents with a com - mon background in which to communicate , absorb , comprehend , and process new information . Cohen and Levinthal ( 1990 ) start from the analogy of how an individual’s prior knowledge and background is related to their cognitive basis , and coin the term absorptive capacity to deﬁne the ability for ﬁrms to achieve these tasks , and exploit its outcome in innovation activities . Accordingly , Nooteboom ( 2000 ) states that for learning reasons , that is , to obtain information and develop knowledge , the scope of cognition must be extended by the interaction with external partners . He also declares that comprehension at the company level can be improved when improving the company’s absorptive capacity , keeping in mind that it is key to have an awareness and understanding of the current information the ﬁrm already possesses ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ) . Thus , cognitive distance between entities is required to be at an optimal level in regards of their absorptive capacity , to be able to learn and realize opportunities in the others’ knowledge base and expertise . Knowledge is cumulative , localized , and tacit by nature ( Antonelli , 1995 ) . This author claims that it is because of this nature that you can generally ﬁnd cognitive diﬀerences between agents . Similarly , Boschma ( 2005 ) states that in a company , the processes of knowledge creation and innovation have a high degree of tacit knowledge themselves , and are the output of cumulative and localized research . Consequently , the cognitive base of diﬀerent organizations will tend to be diﬀerent from each other , along with their absorptive capacity and learning potential . Cognitive proximity between agents increases the chances for collaboration , since ﬁrms have an established tendency to look out for partners close to their own knowledge base . In addition , according to Perez and Soete ( 1988 ) , in order to obtain a new technology , companies require a minimum level of knowledge , without which they would be incapable of moving across their knowledge gap . Given that there is better communication 10 and absorbing new information is more likely because of a better understanding produced by having close cognitive bases , being cognitively proximate ensures a more valuable outcome ( Boschma , 2005 ; Boschma and Lambooy , 1999 ) . When it comes to innovation development and knowledge exchange , agents have a tendency to look for collaboration partners that are both close but at the same time complementary in their respective cognitive and technological capabilities . This is part of what Boschma and Frenken ( 2010 ) call an evolutionary approach , where partner selection is aﬀected by favoring some agents over others in terms of their current knowledge base . Cognitive Proximity and Interdisciplinarity Let us expand the idea of having agents coming from diﬀerent knowledge ﬁelds or disciplines , to the concept of interdisciplinarity . Thus , Boschma and Frenken ( 2010 ) relate interdisciplinarity research collaboration to cognitive proximity , when visualizing the interactions of scientists from complementary ﬁelds has proven helpful to obtain an overview of interdisciplinarity in academic research outputs . Schummer ( 2004 ) deﬁnes a scientiﬁc discipline as a category combining a cognitive and a social body , distinguished by the scientiﬁc community itself , especially , in cases where two disciplines share much of their knowledge set ( e . g . biochemistry and molecular biology ) . Sometimes , the term multidisciplinarity is used indistinctly and interchangeably with interdisciplinarity . However , there is a fundamental diﬀerence between these two terminologies , as explained by Klein ( 1990 , pp . 56 - 63 ) : When multiple disciplines are participating in the same research ﬁeld , but there is no interaction between them , such ﬁeld is said to be highly multidisciplinary , but not interdisciplinary . Likewise , strong interdisciplinary research ( interaction between diﬀerent ﬁelds ) can exist without having a high degree of multidisciplinarity . Interdisciplinarity can sometimes be a rather vague and ambiguous concept , because the underlying cog - nitive and social processes can substantially diﬀer depending on the collaborative project , the techniques used , and the social practices involved ( Rafols et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , the author mentions that interdis - ciplinary research not always implies collaboration between researchers from diﬀerent disciplines ( Bordons et al . , 2005 ) . Plus , when it does mean collaboration , this term may refer to various practices ( Laudel , 2001 ) . In any case , there is an increasing consensus that interdisciplinarity is characterized by knowledge inte - gration ( National Academies Committee on Science , Engineering , and Public Policy ( COSEPUP ) , 2005 ) , in the sense that it is a blend of concepts , tools , techniques , and the information or data itself , coming from numerous bodies of specialized knowledge . In the light of this deﬁnition , Rafols et al . ( 2010 ) note that there has been a signiﬁcant increase in its adoption since the early 1990s by both scientists and policy - makers . 11 It is noteworthy to mention that despite the encouragement for interdisciplinarity in scientiﬁc and in - novation research , this used to not be the case at all ( Rafols et al . , 2010 ) , with the direct opposite being stressed instead . In this regard , Weber et al . ( 1946 , p . 4 ) emphasizes that only strict specialization would ensure lifelong scientiﬁc achievements , warning that “ whoever lacks the capacity to put on blinders , so to speak , . . . may as well stay away from science ” . Nowadays , it would appear that the steps towards greater interdisciplinarity are driven by the need to meet the demands from society or the industry . Moreover , the topic of interdisciplinarity is closely related to innovation in knowledge production ( Weingart , 2000 , p . 30 ) . This has pushed the scientiﬁc realm to recommend it for dealing with issues and better supporting innovation and competitiveness ( Rafols et al . , 2010 ) . Additionally , policy reports have highlighted the importance of interdisciplinarity for strategic technolo - gies such as nanotechnology ( Malsh , 1997 ) . As a matter of fact , all funding programs in nanoscale research take a trans or interdisciplinary approach , so it is vital for the ﬁeld’s development ( Schummer , 2004 ) . Risks in Cognitive Proximity Ultimately , although having interdisciplinary agents that are cognitively proximate is beneﬁcial , we see that when the cognitive distance is too short , this could potentially represent a hindrance for learning , knowledge production , and innovation . Boschma ( 2005 ) provides three reasons to explain why some cognitive distance should necessarily be kept among agents : - In the ﬁrst place , the construction of new knowledge is dependent to some extent on having access to complementary bodies of knowledge . Thus , agents will increase their probability for learning new information from diﬀerent sources , which will , in consequence , trigger new ideas and creativity ( Cohendet and Llerena , 1997 ) . - Secondly , having too much cognitive proximity may result in “cognitive lock - in” when agents are closed to new technologies or market possibilities . To avoid being too cognitively proximate , organizations should guarantee a diversiﬁed supply of information and be broad - minded to the outside world . - Third , a small cognitive distance increases the risk of involuntary spill - overs , which in turn makes competing agents to become highly unwilling to share information . In short , agents need to be separate enough so that knowledge can be combined in new ways , to avoid lock - in potential issues , and decrease in learning possibilities ( Boschma , 2005 ) . However , when there is cognitive distance between agents , the tendency for their capacity for obtaining new knowledge increases , but , it could restrict learning because of problems of communication . Therefore , a compromise must be reached between cognitive distance , in behalf of novelty , and cognitive proximity , in behalf of absorptive capacity . Nooteboom ( 2000 , p . 153 ) aﬃrms that information is useless 12 if it is not new , but it is also useless if it is so new or so diﬀerent that it cannot be understood . As a way to mitigate the potential risks in cognitive proximity , Maskell ( 2001 ) proposes that there must exist a geographical cluster with a common knowledge base composed of diverse , but complementary , knowledge resources . In any case , it is noteworthy to be aware of the importance of having a balanced multidisciplinary environment for generating knowledge , due to the risks involved when balance is not achieved , as seen in the preceding section . We mentioned that a geographical cluster with a knowledge base built from diverse and complementary cognitive resources would be beneﬁcial to attain this balance . Thus , we go into the second proximity dimension targeted in this work : geographical proximity . 2 . 3 . 4 Geographical Proximity The inﬂuence of geography over learning and innovation has ever interested academics from diﬀerent research ﬁelds ( Boschma , 2005 ) , making geographical proximity the most common dimension throughout proximity literature ( Knoben and Oerlemans , 2006 , p . 74 ) . Gittelman ( 2007 ) explains that learning has a collective nature , where linked individuals proﬁt from contributing knowledge at the community level . Geography would in turn favor the transmission and sharing of knowledge , when taking into account that “ knowledge traverses corridors and streets more easily than continents and oceans ” ( Feldman , 1994 , p . 2 ) . We remarked previously on how proximity was originally attached to the notion of physical location , ﬁrst researched from a metropolitan and agronomic viewpoint ( von Th¨unen , 1826 ) . Later on , Marshall ( 1890 ) brought new theoretical approaches for geographical proximity research within an economical and industrial context . He highlighted the importance of physical closeness between ﬁrms with his famous saying : “ the secrets of industry are in the air ” , stressing that localized spill - overs contributed to form a beneﬁcial “industrial atmosphere” ( Shaw and Gilly , 2000 ) that would boost innovation . We ﬁrst ﬁnd geographical proximity as part of the French School of Proximity Dynamics framework , though the French academics did not limit the deﬁnition of this dimension of proximity with physical and natural constraints , claiming that they were not suﬃcient ( Gilly and Torre , 2000 ) . Instead , a social aspect was included , to allow for economic mechanisms and society factors to characterize what they deﬁne as functional distance , to be combined with the spatial aspect within geographical proximity . Among these inﬂuencing factors , we can ﬁnd access time , aﬀected by transport infrastructures , or the ﬁnancial resources that would facilitate the use of ICTs ( Information and Communication Technologies ) . Likewise , we see how in the second studied categorization , Zeller ( 2004 ) states that costs and resources monitoring can decrease when having quick face - to - face interactions , possible when agents are in close - by locations . Moreover , spatially proximate actors would belong to an interpretative community , making 13 them prone to beneﬁt from “noise” from their peers ( in the form of suggestions , approaches , rumors , etc . ) ( Grabher , 1980 , pp . 366 - 9 ) . Thus , geographical proximity is deﬁned by Boschma ( 2005 ) as the spatial or physical distance between agents , either measuring it with an absolute metric of length ( i . e . actual distance units , like meters ) , or a relative metric ( e . g . travel time ) ( Boschma and Frenken , 2010 ) . In their two - dimensional proximity model , Moodysson and Jonsson ( 2007 ) favor the same deﬁnition , in turn labeling it as functional proximity . They indicate that in society nowadays , more important than the location of actors , is the amount of eﬀort required for their interaction , or face - to - face contact ( see also Ter Wal and Boschma , 2009 ) . This would also account for accessibility , which is limited by the time and cost variables involved in the mobility of actors . Ultimately , we see that all the proximity models introduced agree that the deﬁnition of geographical proximity should not be constrained to bare Euclidean physical distance . In any case , Boschma ( 2005 ) remarks that it is imperative to have geographical proximity delineated in such a restrictive way , that it does not contain involvement from other dimensions , and rather keep it isolated for analytical purposes . The goal of this diﬀerentiation is being able to detect when spill - overs are inﬂuenced by geography only , without other kinds of proximity . Risks in Geographical Proximity Nevertheless , though spatial concentration could bring signiﬁcant beneﬁts , having too much geographical proximity between agents could also be harmful for knowledge production , and innovation . One potential risk is that agents within a region could become a too “inward - looking” community with weakened learning ability , and lose their capacity to come up with new ideas or respond to new developments ( Boschma , 2005 ; Gittelman , 2007 ) . This is why regions highly specialized in a certain technology have to make an eﬀort to keep open to external ﬂows of knowledge and solve or avoid situations of spatial lock - in . In fact , the lack of openness to the outside world is actually the factor that combined with geographical closeness , negatively aﬀects innovation and learning ( Boschma , 2005 ) . Likewise , scientists could also suﬀer from what Merton ( 1973 ) calls scientiﬁc parochialism , when restrict - ing their interactions to local colleagues would cause them to stay out of the loop of important information ﬂows in their ﬁeld . Nonetheless , the existing norms in the scientiﬁc research community would prevent these to happen , since the methods for publication and exchanges of draft papers would help scientists to keep updated with work from peers , regardless of geographic distance ( Gittelman , 2007 , p . 13 ) . She goes on highlighting the importance of attending events and conferences to stimulate knowledge exchange and evaluate the possibilities to establish a collaboration relationship among distant agents with shared interests . Yet , another risk of having short distances between agents is that it might make them fearful to share information and lose competitive advantages . The fact that companies could opt to keep the projects they 14 wish to patent in secret , would be a major concern , because it would mean that this knowledge would be missing from published data ( Gittelman , 2007 ) . However , Tallman et al . ( 2004 ) claim that scholars nowadays are leaving behind their concerns on com - petition , and are heading to form communities of knowledge that interact with near companies . These knowledge exchanges among co - located ﬁrms would help to create a knowledge - based theory for the ex - istence of regional geographic clusters ( Maskell , 2001 ) . Moreover , spatial proximity would enable greater transparency and lead to stronger benchmarking activities ( Lublinski , 2003 ) . In regards to potential patent projects , Gittelman ( 2007 ) explains that it would not be a potential source of bias , given that any published work has a grace period of 12 months to be patented , and thus , should not be a cause of concern . Relevance of Geographical Proximity Nowadays Throughout the literature , several authors bring to question whether geographic proximity may still be con - sidered a relevant factor for learning and innovation nowadays ( Lublinski , 2003 ; Boschma , 2005 ; Gittelman , 2007 ; Dettmann and Brenner , 2010 ; Bouba - Olga and Ferru , 2012 ) . It has been argued that the networks through which knowledge ﬂows do not necessarily need to be constrained to a speciﬁc location anymore . Furthermore , the concept that geography should have any impact whatsoever on knowledge production would constitute a paradox in itself , given the intangible nature of new ideas and their potential to diﬀuse widely ( Gittelman , 2007 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) . Nonetheless , there is evidence that suggests that there are strong clustering tendencies for location in some analytical sectors , such as biotechnology ( Asheim and Gertler , 2005 ) . Several authors state that spatial proximity no longer matters because digital means are substituting more and more the need for co - location . In a global economic world as we have these days , distance is not as indispensable as much as it used to before , back when the information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) as well as transportation means were not as developed ( Boschma , 2005 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ; Bouba - Olga and Ferru , 2012 ) . Nowadays , “ geographic separation no longer implies information deprivation ” ( Feldman , 2002 , p . 1 ) , with technology making its exchange regardless of great distance a reality . Some authors have even gone as far as dictating the death or “liberation” from the distance constraint for communications ( and hence , interactive learning ) ( Cairncross , 2001 ) , thanks mainly to the internet , among other factors like lower travel expenses and using English as a global language ( Rallet and Torre , 1999 ) . On the contrary , according to Frenken et al . ( 2010 ) , the idea that geography is not important anymore for scientiﬁc collaborations is just a matter of popular belief . Plus , since the studies performed to test this suﬀer from important limitations , the death of the distance hypothesis has not been proven ( Frenken et al . , 2010 ) . On one hand , it is unquestionable that scientists can communicate well over long distances , and we have examples of this happening at high - tech centers around the world ( such as Silicon Valley in the US , Shinju 15 Science Park in Taiwan , and Bangalore Software Park in India ) ( Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) . On the other hand , Feldman ( 2002 ) explains that the impact of internet is limited due to the tacit nature of knowledge itself , and the social nature intrinsic in the innovation and learning processes . There are two major branches in the discussion about relevance of geographical proximity : one is when considering its impact on knowledge production , and the other branch is when considering its eﬀects on innovation . Furthermore , some authors state that innovation , a particularly knowledge - intensive economic activity , is the only exception where geography still counts at all ( Bouba - Olga and Ferru , 2012 ) . However , we cannot separate the two , as they are closely related and dependent upon each other . It would seem that there are signiﬁcant beneﬁts of spatial proximity for technological innovation , and that they go hand in hand with speciﬁc mechanisms that facilitate rich knowledge exchange within a region . These conclusions were drawn from studies conducted using the only means of quantiﬁable data that would be considered the evidence of new technology : patents . Indeed , Feldman ( 1994 ) found a positive correlation between the amount of knowledge - generating inputs and technological innovation produced within a region . Shapira and Youtie ( 2008 ) call this phenomenon the Strong Path Dependency Hypothesis , indicating that geographic clusters of knowledge production have a strong correlation to either previous high technology waves ( like biotechnology ) or to the presence of powerful institutions ( such as academic or government labs ) . These factors would then become anchors for nanotechnology knowledge - generation ( Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) . Accordingly , some studies conclude that knowledge spill - overs from academic centers to businesses happen because spatial proximity increases the productivity of R & D ( Adams and Jaﬀe , 1996 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) , Jaﬀe ( 1989 ) being the pioneer with his research on each US state . Therefore , the dynamics of being physically close to sources of new knowledge would account for innovative and entrepreneurial activity to cluster geographically in places such as Silicon Valley ( Feldman , 2002 ; Gertler and Wolfe , 2006 ) . When speaking about the importance of geographical closeness in research collaborations , several authors in the literature point out that to establish the required partnerships , its signiﬁcance or necessity is decreasing more and more ( Boschma , 2005 ; Gilly and Torre , 2000 ; Bunnell and Coe , 2001 ; Breschi and Lissoni , 2003 ; Gertler and Wolfe , 2006 ) . In their study on European research collaborations , Bouba - Olga and Ferru ( 2012 ) hypothesize that these conclusions might have been drawn because the existing empirical studies are limited due to the collaboration indicators used . Indeed , only codiﬁed knowledge would be used to measure the knowledge spill - over process ( Howells , 2002 ) . Moreover , the indicators to measure geographical proximity , such as diﬀerentiating between national vs international collaborations , and between administrative divisions within the same country , would impact the results . Likewise , Howells ( 2002 ) criticizes that although these studies seem to conﬁrm that knowledge activity 16 is spatially constrained , the analysis of the mechanisms of knowledge transfer and sharing is greatly lacking . To this respect , Cairncross ( 2001 ) aﬃrms that if we are reaching a point where distance is dying , it should be evident that the importance of proximity is decreasing . However , it is hard to determine whether this importance is increasing or decreasing , due to most studies of knowledge ﬂows using data which does not allow for historical changes versus the spatial factor . In other words , the research performed has been somewhat static , meaning that the measurements are taken at one point in time ( Boschma , 2005 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) . Ultimately , even though it is true that the widespread use of internet has allowed easy and quick access to information regardless of its location ( Feldman , 2002 ) , globalization does not necessarily have to signal the “death of geography” as if they were binary opposites ( Morgan , 2004 ) . Instead , once the agents involved in the processes of innovation and knowledge creation are freed from location constraints , geography could in fact become more important ( Feldman , 2002 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) . Globalization and localization would then be considered as complementary processes , with geography as a framework for individuals and resources in which the spill - overs associated with knowledge creation take place ( Morgan , 2004 ) . For instance , technological companies tend to locate where labor markets with pools of specialized scientists or engineers are readily available ( Almazan et al . , 2007 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) . Paradoxically , improving ICTs and the integration of a global market would result in localized technological interactions ( Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) and a stronger localized ﬂow of knowledge ( Leamer and Storper , 2001 ) . Finally , the dimensions of geographical and cognitive proximity would give an overview of common environmental settings for agents . Yet , studies going in depth on these attributes are unable to fully explain the dynamics nor the fundamental characteristics of collaborative relationships ( Dettmann and Brenner , 2010 , p . 3 ) . Boschma and Frenken ( 2010 ) indicate that a dynamic proximity framework would be the basis for the geography of network formation , remarking on the growing role of networks in the study of ﬁelds with high interdisciplinarity over the last two decades . Nevertheless , they also claim that network analysis is still greatly underdeveloped in the geography of innovation and academic learning . We have seen how the social aspect is mentioned every so often as being primordial for collaborations that generate knowledge , so we will now review the third component of our research : collaborative proximity . 2 . 3 . 5 Collaborative Proximity “ Science is done by humans ” ( Heisenberg , 1969 ) , and scientiﬁc collaboration in academic research is a complex social phenomenon ( Gl¨anzel and Schubert , 2005 ) that scholars have been trying to measure ever since the 1960s ( de Solla Price , 1965 ) . Indeed , nowadays academic knowledge is generally seen as a social accomplishment ( Hyland , 1999 ) . It is then evident that scientiﬁc activities are not entirely devoid of inﬂuences 17 from social aspects , despite the ideal deﬁnition of science as a systematic pursuit for objective truth , without any eﬀect from personal beliefs , biases or social inﬂuence ( Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) . Collaborative proximity represents the distances between scholars and their position within academic col - laboration networks . However , the fact that collaboration is based upon social structure raises the question : Why do we not match this aspect to the social proximity factor deﬁned earlier in the literature as part of proximity dimensions ? As a matter of fact , we even ﬁnd that the term social proximity has been used for this purpose in the literature ( see Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . Nevertheless , we take into consideration that there is more to the social proximity aspect than just mere acquaintanceship , because it may or may not include cultural aspects , requiring a less structured deﬁnition of the social context to which the scholars belong to . Moreover , according to Newman ( 2001b , p . 1 ) , a scientiﬁc network may not be the best scenario to quantify a purely social component . This because they do not directly measure actual contact between people , though their structure would be a reﬂection of the society that built them . Subsequently , we rather coin the term collaborative proximity , adding it to the list of proximity aspects addressed in this study , by virtue of adjusting to the proper terminology in proximity frameworks . If we consider that original ideas arising from academic publications or technological innovation are the product of collaborations between agents ( either scientists or inventors ) ( Eslami et al . , 2013 , p . 1 ) , collaboration is thence key for knowledge production . Moreover , there is an increasing importance for using natural mechanisms of cognition and information ﬁltering for scholarly purposes through social connections ( such as collaboration links ) . This importance is a reasonable response to the fact that available research is increasing , and that we have a limited ability to keep track of potentially relevant articles ( Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) . However , how can we quantify collaboration ? First , we must clarify that the scope of collaboration throughout this thesis refers to scientiﬁc individual collaboration or “inter - individual” ( as labeled by ( Katz and Martin , 1997 ) ) , as opposed to collaboration at the institution or regional level . There are many ways that show how researchers collaborate , such as co - authorship , co - partnership in projects , and co - citing pub - lications ( Jiang , 2008 ) . Still , co - authored publication ( also , multiple - author publication ( Katz and Martin , 1997 ) ) is typically considered as the most visible and well documented indicator for collaborative activity among scholars ( Abbasi et al . , 2010 ; Gl¨anzel and Schubert , 2005 ) . In scientist networks , people co - writing articles would know one another quite well ( Newman , 2001b ) . In such respect , Katz and Martin ( 1997 ) bring to our attention that despite the abundance of studies using this technique to investigate collaboration , there is a clear distinction between the concept of collaboration and co - authorship , and that they should not be deemed as synonyms . Among the limitations of co - authorship metrics , we ﬁnd that sometimes scholars would be included as co - authoring a paper merely because of social conventions , and that in reality they could not be attributed to the research work itself , nor its credit 18 ( Hagstrom , 1965 ) . The opposite could also happen , when for example , two researchers have actually worked together , but decide to publish two independent ﬁeld - targeted articles respectively ( Katz and Martin , 1997 ) . It could also even go to the extremes of being part of scientiﬁc fraud , when the so - called “honorary co - authors” are not even aware of their listing in a publication ( LaFollette , 1992 , pp . 97 - 101 ) . Another concern is how the magnitude of contribution varies during the timeline of a research project , due to the complex nature of human interaction among collaborators ( Subramanyam , 1983 , p . 35 ) . There - fore , Katz and Martin ( 1997 ) insinuate that the only way in which co - authorship could truly be an accurate reﬂection of collaboration would be by setting a well - deﬁned scale of “joint work intensity” , in which re - searchers would only be listed as co - authors if they surpassed a certain threshold . But , at the same time , they also state how impossible setting or enforcing such a criterion would be . On the other hand , Gl¨anzel and Schubert ( 2005 ) dismiss these caution warnings to some extent . For them , even if co - authorship were considered as a partial or approximate indicator of scientiﬁc collaboration , studying it allows us to gain valuable insight into measurable interaction between collaborative work and performance metrics of scientiﬁc communication , particularly in science - based ﬁelds such as nanotechnology ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . Additionally , thanks to the scientiﬁc community’s strict authorship regulations , we should be able to safely assume that each co - author has indeed signiﬁcantly contributed to the common research in the paper ( Schummer , 2004 ) . Furthermore , more intense collaboration would go hand in hand with increasing co - authorship between researchers , ( Patel , 1973 ) , and thus , they conclude that there is an undeniable positive correlation between the both ( Gl¨anzel and Schubert , 2005 ) . All considered , co - authored papers are a proxy measure adequate enough to quantify collaboration among groups of researchers . Moreover , studies and reports show that scientiﬁc collaboration ( with co - authorship as metric ) has intensiﬁed in all science areas , though it has not yet been proved whether this eﬀect was caused by the formation of stable contributor teams , or if it is rather due to the temporary creation of casual links ( Gl¨anzel and Schubert , 2005 ) . Anyhow , two scientists who have worked together at least once are more likely to later keep in touch for meaningful information exchange , and thus , it would presumably result in repeated collaboration between researchers ( Agrawal et al . , 2006 ; Beaudry and Schiﬀauerova , 2011 ) . Finally , the fundamental process of science is communication , without which , science itself cannot exist ( Lievrouw , 1989 ) . It is critical then to establish communication and this is where proximity comes to facilitate it , by bridging gaps that would otherwise keep academics from learning and exchanging vital information for the development of science . 19 Collaboration and Co - authorship We ﬁnd in the literature that there are three established methods for studying scientiﬁc collaboration and endorsement ( e . g . Milojevic , 2010 ; Ding , 2011 ) : qualitative methods ( like using surveys , interviews , or obser - vations ) , bibliometric methods ( using publication counting , citation counting , or co - citation analysis ) , and complex network methods ( like shortest path , centralities , network parameters , or PageRank / HITS ) . From these , there are two approaches that have the potential to explain the structure of scientiﬁc com - munication , which are the use of citation analysis ( part of bibliometrics ) and social network analysis ( Marion et al . , 2003 ) . These two mechanisms have a lot in common , which is why researchers in each ﬁeld tend to use similar tools when conducting their studies ( Sternitzke et al . , 2008 ; Marion et al . , 2003 ) . A research paper is “a rhetorically sophisticated artifact” with a careful balance of both factual informa - tion and social interaction ( Hyland , 1999 ) . Based on scientiﬁc documents , citation analysis has been widely used in science research since a long time ago ( e . g . Hummon and Dereian , 1989 ) , and it is a valid way to describe relationships between scientiﬁc authors ( Otte and Rousseau , 2002 ) . Likewise , co - authorship has been traditionally studied with bibliometric analysis tools . Moreover , we ﬁnd authors in our review claiming that almost every aspect of scientiﬁc collaboration can be tracked through bibliometric techniques to analyze co - authorship networks ( Gl¨anzel and Schubert , 2005 ) . However , bibliometric methods still have some shortfalls for co - authorship studies , because they lack ways to see how it interacts with other important processes of scientiﬁc communication , such as publication activity and citation behavior ( Gl¨anzel and Schubert , 2005 ) . We ﬁnd another limitation in that it is yet unable to examine some aspects of scientiﬁc collaboration , particularly when considering scholar research interests and social connections ( Ding , 2011 ) . This happens because in bibliometric analysis the focus is on ranking individual nodes , which causes it to overlook the relationships found between two speciﬁc nodes . It would then lack the capacity to discover scholarly communication patterns ( notably for collaboration and knowledge diﬀusion ) with ﬁner granularity ( Ding , 2011 ) . On the contrary , the focus in social network analysis is on the characteristics of the relationships or ties , rather than on the intrinsic characteristics of the individual members ( Wetherell et al . , 1994 , p . 645 ) . Remarkably , previous research shows that coauthors tend to cite each other sooner after co - publishing a paper as compared to non - coauthors ( Martin et al . , 2013 ) . This strong tendency towards reciprocal citation patterns ( Bethard and Jurafsky , 2010 ) would already give an inkling as to the inﬂuence social aspects have over scholarly citing behavior . Furthermore , we have previously seen how scientiﬁc networks seem to be characterized by collaboration that takes place in many informal ways , ( e . g . mass media and interpersonal channels like conference par - ticipation ) . This would then represent another impediment for tracking knowledge spread solely by the use of conventional ( bibliometric ) measures for spill - overs , such as cross - citation and co - publication ( Murray , 20 2002 ; Rogers , 2002 ) , without considering the social connections between researchers found when taking the collaboration network into account ( Beaudry and Schiﬀauerova , 2011 ) . Nowadays , we ﬁnd more and more that social network analysis is used to analyze the way scientists are interconnected ( Beaudry and Schiﬀauerova , 2011 ) . Social network analysis is a methodology for studying formal communication networks , as opposed to the communication ties that naturally occur in informal networks , like between colleagues , or members of an institution ( Marion et al . , 2003 ) . The interest in social networks has rapidly been increasing for several years now ( Borgatti , 2003 ; Beaudry and Schiﬀauerova , 2011 ) , and its usage spans to a wide variety of ﬁelds . Furthermore , many empirical studies that applied it for researching scientiﬁc communities have proven how powerful this kind of analysis is for understanding the growth and spread of information ( Marion et al . , 2003 ) . Newman ( 2001b ) exempliﬁes the high potential of information spread with the famous experiment conducted by Milgram ( 1967 ) , who took a practical approach to demonstrate the small - world hypothesis . This experiment suggests that pairs of scientists in a population typically have a short path of intermediate acquaintances between them , even when the size of the population is very large . In other words , every researcher would “know someone who knows someone” , and thus information or knowledge diﬀusion would use collaboration networks as pathway . We ﬁnd some examples of this kind of analysis applied to co - authorship ( e . g . Newman , 2001b , 2004 ; Barab´asi et al . , 2001 ) , where the focus is on the structure of scientiﬁc collaboration networks , taking co - authorship patterns from individuals as basis . Ultimately , collaborative proximity would be an inﬂuential factor for knowledge diﬀusion in the scholarly realm , even if there could be involvement from other aspects . 2 . 3 . 6 Interaction between Geographical Proximity and other Dimensions Although the deﬁnition and measurement of proximity factors need to be strictly demarcated , this does not forcefully imply that their eﬀects should be analyzed without involving other dimensions . For instance , the eﬀect of the spatial dimension is not usually direct or evident , but it is rather a subtle and varied inﬂuence ( Howells , 2002 ; Dettmann and Brenner , 2010 ) . This is what makes it so diﬃcult to verify the claim of whether or not geography is signiﬁcant , since a methodology that completely isolates the geographical eﬀects from other factors has not been reported yet Katz ( 1994 ) . Howells ( 2002 ) argues that geography inﬂuences all knowledge activity in ﬁve speciﬁc ways , from the perspective of the individual or agent . If we regard an individual as a “knowing self” , we can say that this entity is inﬂuenced by the various factors related to geography , such as social , cultural , and economic . Likewise , human interaction , the exchange and interpretation of information ( in codiﬁed and tacit forms , also involving past experience ) , and learning itself ( in all the multiple settings where it can take place ) are all aﬀecting the individual . And they are all closely related to geography , distance , and proximity . 21 Throughout the literature , we ﬁnd that knowledge transfer can be associated with other proximity di - mensions other than the spatial one alone . This has been accepted even by some of the strongest supporters of a regional world , such as Storper ( 1997 ) . We see examples of interactive learning taking place in settings where other dimensions , such as techno - logical or organizational , are more relevant than the geographical aspect , like in a multinational corporation ( MNC ) ( Zeller , 2004 ) . This is due to the existence of information and communication technology nowa - days , which in turn allows for networks to exist and be kept alive outside of spatial constraints ( Rallet and Torre , 1999 ) . Given the non - territorial deﬁnition of networks , it would consequently follow that knowledge spill - overs are not necessarily spatially bounded ( Bunnell and Coe , 2001 ) . Hence , Boschma ( 2005 ) argues that geographical proximity should always be assessed with regard to other dimensions , given that spatial concentration alone is not an absolute generator of eﬀective synergies ( Zeller , 2004 , p . 5 ) . We could say that it rather enforces or strengthens other proximity categories , because it is a decisive factor in the channels through which knowledge is generated and transferred , which are the cultural , social , and psychological spaces ( Howells , 2002 ) . Moreover , when evaluating the prerequisites for learning to take place , geographical proximity alone is neither a necessary nor suﬃcient condition , despite the fact that it makes interaction and cooperation easier ( Malecki and Oinas , 1999 ; Boschma , 2005 ) . In particular , it is important to consider the social aspect involved in geographical proximity , given that social interactions are a key element for all the dimensions implicated in innovation ( Zeller , 2004 ; Tallman et al . , 2004 ; Murray , 2002 ) . Proof of this would be the correlation for better innovative performance when creative technological companies are located near knowledge sources when compared to that of companies placed farther away ( Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg , 1999 ) . Thus , a regional cluster formed by ﬁrms tied together by the links of geographical co - location and complex social interaction ( Tallman et al . , 2004 ) will be more inclined to geographically - favored spill - overs happening around agents concentrated in space . Likewise , the larger the combined geographical and social distance between agents , the less the intensity of these positive externalities will be ( Boschma , 2005 ) . Simply put , this means that when people are situated nearer , making new contacts as well as exchanging tacit , non - verbal knowledge between the parties is easier , so much so that these informal understandings in turn would contribute to sharing technical knowledge ( Katz , 1994 ; Tallman et al . , 2004 ; Boschma , 2005 ; Dettmann and Brenner , 2010 ) . Either by accidental meetings or by introductions from a third common party , spatial proximity allows for initial meetings that trigger the process that deﬁnes the starting point of a collaborative relationship ( Dettmann and Brenner , 2010 ) . Storper ( 1997 ) labels the exchanges of perceptions and shared experiences originated from regular social interactions as untraded interdependencies . These interdependencies are formed by informal rules and codes of conduct , running in parallel with the established and formal mechanisms in 22 which information exchanges would typically take place ( such as market procedures for licensing ) . Since interpersonal interaction is a requirement for untraded interdependencies , Tallman et al . ( 2004 ) state that they are more likely to be tied to geographic location , as opposed to regular economic transactions , which can spread more widely . In this respect , personal academic ties would seem to overcome geography , a behavior which might have been accentuated with the growth of Internet use ( Murray , 2002 ) . Given that location proximity to scientiﬁc and technological knowledge would not suﬃce , speciﬁc trans - fer mechanisms need to be in place for the diﬀusion of externalities from where they origin to where they are ultimately implemented ( Boufaden and Plunket , 2007 ) . Since scientists are not engineers ( Allen et al . , 1977 ) , these two groups have diﬀerent ways to create , communicate , and draw value from knowledge ( Git - telman , 2007 ) . Thus , Boufaden and Plunket ( 2007 ) remark that identifying technological opportunities and facilitating communication require dense networks of researchers , technicians , and entrepreneurs . We introduced previously the signiﬁcance of networks as pathways for knowledge ﬂow , particularly for knowledge externalities or spill - overs . On the one hand , it is likely that geographical proximity is a prereq - uisite for the very existence and sustaining of these social networks themselves , thus , making the consequent knowledge spill - overs to be spatially - bounded ( Boschma , 2005 ) . On the other hand , being involved in the social connectedness of agents networks within a speciﬁc region is key , because these social networks would exclude outsiders , even if the agents are locally situated ( Hudson , 1999 ) . The importance of this is exempliﬁed by an MNC trying to tap the knowledge base of a host location by setting up a local branch there ( Blanc and Sierra , 1999 ) , and failing because its members are not part of the tight networks of personal relationships through which local knowledge ﬂows ( Breschi and Lissoni , 2003 ; Boschma , 2005 ) . Dettmann and Brenner ( 2010 ) emphasize the social aspect , categorizing collaboration stages in terms of trust , which would be the outcome of personal interaction between agents , and the way the agents would evaluate reputation or prestige ( Gittelman , 2007 ) and overall trustworthiness . In this respect , the frequency for these face - to - face contacts would be enhanced by spatial proximity , since it would be easier for the processes that help building trust between agents to take place ( processes such as learning about character , respective motives , and sociocultural background ) ( Lublinski , 2003 ) . Katz ( 1994 ) goes as far as to say that this communication may lead to gradually greater commitments for cooperation in a fashion similar to courtship . In any case , social networks would be the main and most productive channel for knowledge diﬀusion ( Breschi and Lissoni , 2001 ) , by automatically leading to cooperative behavior for its sharing and common learning processes ( Asheim and Gertler , 2005 ) . However , not only social networks are required , or could substitute spatial nearness . Indeed , some of the other dimensions could compensate the need for geographical proximity . As a matter of fact , Boschma ( 2005 ) further hypothesizes that when spatial nearness is combined with some level of cognitive proximity , 23 it is a suﬃcient condition for interactive learning to occur . Thus , with the dynamics of knowledge creation and social networks , it is unlikely that the scientiﬁc knowledge of a speciﬁc domain would be demarcated within a single region ( Gittelman , 2007 ) . Rather , scientiﬁc communities would be geographically dispersed , with local groups being part of bigger communities that collectively respond to similar social and intellectual forces Merton ( 1973 ) . Companies or academic institutions need to ﬁnd ways to create proximity between their agents wherever they may be . Hence , they must either bridge the gap caused by physical dispersal , or take advantage of the beneﬁts of concentration when it does exist ( Schoenberger , 1997 , p . 21 ) . Furthermore , there seems to be an inverse relationship between geographical and cognitive proximity , meaning that only when cognitive proximity is low can then geographical nearness become important to overcome this gap ( Freel , 2003 ) . Singh ( 2005 ) supported this hypothesis with patents data , where he found that in interdisciplinary research collaboration ( when cognitive proximity is low ) geographical proximity plays an important role , whereas greater spatial distances are more common when agents work in the same ﬁeld ( that is , cognitive proximity is high ) . If we look at organizational proximity ( or relational proximity ) , we ﬁnd that there could also be an involvement of geographical proximity , in terms of the ease it brings to creating and maintaining institutional practices , such as codes of conduct , norms , and habits ( Boschma , 2005 ) . Moreover , Kraut et al . ( 1988 ) relate three dimensions : spatial , organizational , and social in terms of the probability of collaborations , proving that spatial proximity has a positive impact on it . An exemplary scenario would be agents having their oﬃces on the same ﬂoor or in the same building , forcefully having a higher frequency of interaction , such as unintended meetings , or getting together to have lunch . At the same time , this proximity dimension could also be in many cases more important and direct than geographical proximity ( Amin and Cohendet , 1999 ) , or even act as a valid replacement ( Rallet and Torre , 1999 ) , particularly when a strong central authority ( i . e . the managerial team in a MNC’s headquarters ) is the one coordinating all tasks and information ﬂow ( Boschma and Frenken , 2010 ) . Nevertheless , despite having other dimensions involved , which could maximize or even substitute the need for spatial closeness , it is essential to mention that personal contact was still required for exchanging tacit knowledge . In this respect , distance seems to be a discontinuous variable , meaning that the advantages of spatial proximity are not linear to distance ( looking more like a Gaussian curve ) . It follows that “ to be within walking distance is very diﬀerent from being slightly farther away ” ( Sonn and Storper , 2008 , p . 2 ) . Accordingly , the communication mechanisms that operate within close proximity are replaced by more formal means ( like publication ) beyond a certain distance where informal channels are no longer available ( Adams and Jaﬀe , 1996 ) . However , Boschma ( 2005 ) claims that this does not necessarily have to mean that the agents must have geographical proximity , if we refer to it as permanent co - location , but that these face - to - face contacts could be arranged by traveling . 24 All considered , we could say that even though we have inﬂuences of other dimensions , geography still plays a key role in learning . Particularly , when it comes by means of spill - overs happening around agents ( Wallsten , 2001 ) , allowing them to share knowledge in both formal and informal ways . 2 . 4 Citations We have discussed by and large about the diﬀusion of scholarly knowledge and how proximity aspects might serve as channels for its ﬂow . Yet , how do we track something as intangible as knowledge ? Trajtenberg et al . ( 1997 ) aﬃrm that even though knowledge ﬂows are invisible , leaving no trail by which they may be measured and their patterns discerned , they do leave a paper footprint in the form of citations . Citations have been extensively applied for studying knowledge diﬀusion across a variety of dimensions , and are considered to be valid measures for tracing out knowledge ﬂows ( Alcacer and Gittelman , 2006 ) . We refer to de Solla Price ( 1965 ) , who originally introduced the concept of scholarly research , for deﬁning academic knowledge as a collection of highly cited papers that represent the frontiers of science . It follows that citation is key for facilitating scientiﬁc collaboration and enhancing communication within a scientiﬁc domain . 2 . 4 . 1 Deﬁning Citation Garﬁeld ( 1998 ) labeled citationology as the theory and practice of citation . Citation is a basic component of an academic article , which helps authors to establish facts and communicate with others by setting the context of the knowledge addressed by the new contribution ( Hyland , 1999 ) . Moreover , in scholarly writing it is mandatory to explicitly refer to the work of others . This exigency is always enforced , given that “ new work has to be embedded in a community - generated literature to demonstrate its relevance and importance ” ( Berkenkotter and Huckin , 1995 , p . 3 ) . Formal referencing is crucial in scientiﬁc research , since citation counts are usually the raw data for evaluating scientiﬁc performance ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) , moreover , being cited is considered to be a critical goal in scholarship ( Garﬁeld , 1979 ) . The signiﬁcance of citation is highlighted by the fact that the number of citations within an article has been steadily increasing in time , which in turn has improved its value , by more focused and pertinent referencing ( Hyland , 1999 ) . Furthermore , citations are viewed as “a complex and multidimensional phenomenon” ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) due to authors using citations for diﬀerent reasons and meanings ( Garﬁeld , 1998 ) . Citing motivations were ﬁrst categorized by Garﬁeld et al . ( 1965 ) , then by Brooks ( 1985 ) , and ﬁnally by Cano ( 1989 ) and Shadish et al . ( 1995 ) ( who in addition typiﬁed citation factors ) , by means of either the semantic content of the citing papers , or through citer surveys or interviews ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) . 25 However , Small ( 1973 ) criticizes that classiﬁcation schemes have not been accumulative work , because each regarded their approach as unique . Indeed , useful though they may be , they suﬀer from methodological weaknesses that would aﬀect their reliability and replicability for further citation categorization ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) . Nevertheless , they all agree that there is more to the citing decision than mere content value or the need to acknowledge intellectual inﬂuences of peers ; in fact , there is a wide number of non - scientiﬁc factors playing a role in this behavior ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) . These are discussed in the following section . 2 . 4 . 2 Citing Behavior To cite or not to cite : what motivates scholars to reference particular works from fellow scientists ? Besides being an obligation in academic writing , we ﬁnd that it is common to cite authors with a perceived degree of success ( e . g . awards , Nobel laureateship , prestige , etc . ) or whose publication has been deemed as a well - known “concept marker” ( Case and Higgins , 2000 ) . In other words , “famous” scholars pioneering in their ﬁeld ( their research is thus considered a classic reference ) , would likely be cited by those writers wishing to pay them homage ( Garﬁeld et al . , 1965 ) , or those believing that citing a prestigious work will promote the cognitive authority of their own paper ( Case and Higgins , 2000 ) . Remarkably , the importance of reputation is such that it causes citations to follow an approximately log - normal distribution , with notorious names roughly balanced by obscure ones , and authors of middling reputation taking up the majority ( White , 2004 , p . 93 ) . According to Garﬁeld et al . ( 1965 ) , the most frequent use of citations was what Brooks ( 1985 ) calls professional motivations , where they become the groundwork for the new publication by providing theoretical and practical ( i . e . methodology and / or ﬁndings ) content of prior authors . Sometimes , the reason for this is that preceding articles have a degree of creativity , involving unusual or innovative methods or theoretical perspectives ( Shadish et al . , 1995 ) . All in all , writers use citations to “examine the products of science” ( Lievrouw , 1989 ) and give credit to colleagues whose work they use ; formal referencing would then represent intellectual or cognitive inﬂuence on scientiﬁc work ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) . On the contrary , Radicchi et al . ( 2008 ) argue that citation does not necessarily reﬂect the scientiﬁc merit of the cited work ( in terms of quality or relevance ) . Actually , it sometimes could even be superﬂuous , in cases where more references are required to meet compulsory citation numbers , thus becoming unnecessary ( Brooks , 1985 ) . Moreover , although Garﬁeld et al . ( 1965 ) recognize the need to substantiate claims by using supportive citations ( Shadish et al . , 1995 ) , academics would not be solely motivated by the pure interest of using literature as a testimony that allows them to situate new work in the context of already accredited research ( Hyland , 1999 ) . As a matter of fact , instead of “giving credit where credit is due” , they frequently fail to 26 cite pertinent work , rather tending to only cite those whose views support their own ( Cronin , 1982 ) , which is why this citing motivation has been frowned upon by some authors in the literature . Not to mention that this strategy of supporting current claims ( Hyland , 1999 ) is sometimes taken to the extreme , where citations rather portray the behavior of scholars “scouring the literature” for justiﬁcation ( Brooks , 1985 , p . 227 ) and arguments that would allow them to persuade through “manipulative rhetoric” ( White , 2004 , p . 93 ) . In addition , another tool employed is the use of negative citations ( Shadish et al . , 1995 ) , where previous works are criticized and their claims disputed , manifesting negative homage to the original writer ( Garﬁeld et al . , 1965 , p . 85 ) . On this subject , Case and Higgins ( 2000 ) explain that citers using this tactic expect their criticism to generate a perception leading to establish them as authoritative , critical thinkers . In spite of this , Garﬁeld et al . ( 1965 ) found that generally , scientiﬁc references were used more often for the positive purposes of citation than they were exploited as objects for refutation . Anyhow , citing behavior would mostly suggest endorsement , authority conferral , provenance tracking , and scholarly trust ( Ding , 2011 ) . However , citation counts do not have the potential of yielding insights into the motives behind a writer’s citing behavior ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) . Indeed , since citations are sometimes made for social reasons ( Shadish et al . , 1995 ) , citing behavior may be a simple indicator of more complex behaviors or social relationships ( Lievrouw , 1989 ) . Likewise , constructing academic facts is deemed as a social process with several interactions : there is the need for acceptance based on negotiation with editors , reviewers , and also readers granting their ratiﬁcation on the novel contribution ( Hyland , 1999 ) . The fact that social relations are important is made clear when , for example , new claims published by an academic whose credibility has been lost within a scientiﬁc community are pretty much ignored ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) . Scholars seek to establish a persuasive and social framework for the approval of their arguments ( Hyland , 1999 ) , aiming to build social relationships in the scientiﬁc community through what is known as connectional citations ( Brooks , 1985 ) . In this regard , credit is attributed to stand for the interaction among the authors and those whom they cite ( Lievrouw , 1989 ) . By the same token , to understand the social processes of science , which is essentially communicative in nature ( Lievrouw , 1989 ) , we need to understand that citations are aﬀected by social networks ( White , 2001 ) . In this respect , Bornmann and Daniel ( 2008 ) take a critical stance on the two competing traditional citing behavior theories : the normative theory , which concerns the relevance of cited works , and the social constructive view . In their ﬁndings , the latter contradicts the assumptions mentioned above about acknowledging useful background in prior publications , in turn stating that citations are inﬂuenced by personal bias and / or social pressures ( e . g . by Brooks ( 1985 ) : when a reference is included because the author depends on the cited writer in some way ) . 27 Among the social reasons , we ﬁnd scholars citing papers authored by an inﬂuential reviewer ( Shadish et al . , 1995 ) , wishing to build or maintain a professional connection to their writer ( Brooks , 1985 ) , because they want to gain the favor of editors , or colleagues ( Vinkler , 1987 ) , or simply to publicize their own or others’ previous research ( Brooks , 1985 ) . Furthermore , citation analysis reveals that clusters of research papers can be interpreted as networks of interpersonal contacts ( Lievrouw , 1989 ) , with authors mostly citing publications by people with whom they are personally acquainted ( White , 2001 ) . Additionally , scientists favor authors they have collaborated with in the past ( Martin et al . , 2013 ) , resulting in a strong tendency in citation patterns ( Bethard and Jurafsky , 2010 ) . Altogether , communicative interaction exists among members of the network ; though in the past , this aspect used to be neglected when describing social structures in citation ( Lievrouw , 1989 ) . Few studies have aimed to discern the behavior that causes non - citations ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) , among which Cronin ( 1981 ) was the ﬁrst to investigate the diﬀerences in writers’ opinions that would lead them to question the necessity to cite . Even though there is a number of minor reasons inducing non - citing behavior , such as poor availability of the document , technical issues such as typos , and cultural aspects like language , it would seem that authors decide to make reference or not according to social reasons and speciﬁcally , acquaintanceship ( Bornmann and Daniel , 2008 ) . Moreover , Bornmann and Daniel ( 2008 ) claim that giving credit to intellectual inﬂuences is deﬁnitely not a priority for writers when it comes to choosing whom to cite . In scientiﬁc literature , knowledge construction is in the hands of the scientiﬁc community members , so it follows that their decisions are socially grounded ( Hyland , 1999 ) . Nonetheless , citation potential varies among ﬁelds ( Garﬁeld , 1979 ) , and representatives would be inﬂuenced by the inquiry patterns and knowledge structures of their respective academic domains ( Hyland , 1999 ) . Certainly , ﬁeld variation aﬀects the evaluation of scientiﬁc performance , causing diﬀerent citation behavior according to discipline , due to , for instance , varying requirements for citation counts or unbalanced cross - discipline citations ( Radicchi et al . , 2008 ) . In conclusion , among the factors that inﬂuence citing behavior , social and cognitive reasons are involved to a great extent . In the next section , we review previous works of authors who have dealt with the eﬀect of the targeted proximity dimensions on citation . 2 . 5 Impact of Proximity on Citations As initially stated , our goal is to examine the inﬂuence of proximity on knowledge diﬀusion , as expressed by citation . Thus , in this section we include a comprehensive discussion ( summarized in Table 2 of the objectives , methods , and ﬁndings of the most relevant empirical studies found in the literature addressing this topic . 28 Authors studying proximity eﬀects on citation Author ( s ) Focus Proximity factors addressed Variables Network Level Data selected for analysis Assesment Cog / Tech Geo Collab Other Target Dependant Var Participants Database ( s ) Location Domain Baldi ( 1998 ) Academic (cid:2) (cid:2) * Citingbehavior Citationlink Social , noSNA Micro 5 , 000links Global Astrophysics Logisticregression RafolsandMeyer ( 2007 ) Academic (cid:2) (cid:2) * Crossdisciplinarity Citationcount Micro 5casestudies UK Bionanotech Descriptivestats Ding ( 2011 ) Academic (cid:2) (cid:2) Collabandcitationstrength Coauthor , citation Micro 15 , 367papers WoS Global Inforetrieval Descriptivestats Abbasietal .

Baldi ( 2013 ) was the ﬁrst to assess scholarly impact by means of inspecting several metrics and their inﬂuence on citation probability . The goal of his research was to conﬁrm which of the major citing behavior theories discussed above ( normative or social constructivism ) was the most inﬂuential for establishing an eﬀective citation . The analysis employed almost 5 , 000 cases of potential citation links , extracted from a matrix formed by 100 papers publications in the domain of astrophysics . While his focus was not prox - imity dimension per se , his model still makes use of certain variables denoting proximity . For instance , cognitive proximity was denoted by a categorization of the research topics and subtopics of the two papers ( citing / cited ) , revealing veriﬁable impact on citation probability . In addition , other explanatory variables were included , like quality ( in terms of citation counts ) , attributes of the article such as size ( number of pages ) , cited author rank and prestige ; interestingly , these last two failed to signiﬁcantly improve the model . As for the social aspect , despite the author’s claim of a network analytic approach , it did not strictly follow a collaborative deﬁnition , in that no co - authorship network nor any centrality metrics were analyzed . Instead , social ties between authors were represented by a scale indicating whether both writers ever worked at the same institution or graduated from the same department . Moreover , the only social aspect adopted that was found to have any signiﬁcance on the probability was author gender . In sum , the social constructivist hypothesis was rejected , in favor of the normative one , denoted by the cognitive closeness ; although , admittedly , the need for better social and collaboration metrics was evidenced ( Baldi , 1998 ) . Later , Rafols and Meyer ( 2007 ) assessed the cross - disciplinarity level of case studies on a bionanotech - nology specialization , expressed by the citation counts according to the department aﬃliation of the team , a scale of the case’s citation level ( cited by various sources ) , and an existing collaboration between the authors and the outside world ( again , no co - authorship network was employed ) . Despite the study limitations ( only 5 case studies ) , the authors took the result of the poor behavior of the cognitive aﬃliation of the team members on citation counts as potential evidence to indicate that nanotechnology is not as cross - disciplinary as in the idealistic “nano - visions” of having research teams from diﬀerent disciplinary departments ( Rafols and Meyer , 2007 ) . Furthermore , Ding ( 2011 ) inspected attributes of the co - author and paper - citation networks to verify collaboration and citation strength on papers about information retrieval from the Web of Science ( WoS ) database . The “strength” was denoted by a scale based on shortest path indicating the proximity between the authors in each network ( the closer , the stronger the link ) . The top 20 authors per topic ( productivity deﬁned in terms of individual citation counts ) were chosen to explore cognitive similarity between collaborators in 30 the co - publishing network , as well as the top 100 highly cited authors from the paper - citation network . He found that productive authors tend to directly coauthor and cite colleagues sharing the same cognitive interests ( research ﬁeld ) , while scholars with diﬀerent research interests were indirectly connected to these authors . Nonetheless , the approach taken in this study was geared more to relating the two networks rather than purely assessing the eﬀect of proximity on citations . Contrarily , Abbasi et al . ( 2011 ) studied the eﬀect of collaborative proximity on the performance ( evaluated by the citation counts manifested in the g - index ) of 2 , 139 publications in various science domains from the top ﬁve universities of United States . Their ﬁndings show that the research performance of scholars ( g - index ) is positively correlated with four Social Network Analysis ( SNA ) metrics : degree centrality ( coauthors count ) , eﬃciency ( strong co - authorship relationship to a single individual ) , and ties strength ( deﬁned by co - published works count ) , which manifested a positive signiﬁcant inﬂuence , whereas eigenvector centrality displayed a negative signiﬁcant eﬀect . On the other hand , betweenness and closeness centrality metrics did not reach statistical signiﬁcance , and were thus discarded as non - important measures for performance . Even though Onel et al . ( 2011 ) and Wallace et al . ( 2012 ) addressed citation counts aﬀected by collabora - tive proximity ( in papers from the WoS database on nanotechnology and miscellaneous ﬁelds respectively ) , they followed a high - level approach . That is , they focused on averages of SNA metrics of the whole network , performing an analysis on the distributions displayed . In this regard , Onel et al . ( 2011 ) explored shortest path , degree centrality , and clustering coeﬃcient mean values on both the co - authorship and paper - citation network ; the aim of the research was ﬁtting distribution models , so no conclusive eﬀects of these metrics were discerned . In contrast to this approach , Wallace et al . ( 2012 ) adopted a degree centrality - based category ( similar to the Erd˝os number ) , and determined that there is wide variation among ﬁelds in the propensity to cite co - authors , and co - authors of co - authors . Plus , papers citing collaborators exhibited a tendency to also cite distant collaborators ( i . e . authors indirectly connected in the network ) . Likewise targeting collaborative proximity , Liu et al . ( 2014 ) employed time - windows to inspect the co - authorship links between 16 , 582 scientiﬁc publications from ﬁve leading universities in the United States . However , a diﬀerent perspective was used to assess this eﬀect : the citation hazard rate , representing the likelihood of a paper being cited at a speciﬁc time . Among the SNA metrics adopted , degree centrality and structural holes ( representing tie strength in the network ) were found to be the best performing , while betweenness centrality only displayed a mild eﬀect , and the Bonacich power ( closely related to eigenvector centrality ) was altogether discarded . Abbasi et al . ( 2011 ) manifested that social network of researchers can be used to predict the future performance of scholars . By the same token , in a recent work Sarig¨ol et al . ( 2014 ) actually implemented predicting techniques , in addition to statistical testing and time - windows , to conclude that centrality metrics in co - authorship network , at the time of a paper publication , are indicative for future paper success ( as 31 measured by citation counts ) . They focused on the largest cluster of connected authors ( i . e . the giant component ) in a network formed by 108 , 758 publications of Computer Science extracted from MSAS ( the Microsoft Academic Search database ) , thus becoming the ﬁrst large - scale analysis of the relation between citation dynamics and the researcher’s position within a collaboration network . Moreover , they combined network characteristics based on degree , betweenness , eigenvector , and k - core centrality measurements , comparing the relationship between the position shifts in time of centrality distributions versus citation success . Their ﬁndings suggest that co - authorship centrality metrics can indeed signify citation success by discovering statistical dependencies between the two . In like manner , the inverse relation was explored , hence discovering that an academic with citation success would later become more central in the collaboration network ; although said author already had a good position in the network , which allegedly favored citation success to start with . However , each centrality separately only displayed weak , if at all , correlation with citation counts . Sarig¨ol et al . ( 2014 ) warn that this may be due to their chosen methods to test this statistical dependency ( Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney tests ) being more complex than simple correlation . Instead of , for example , having a scholar with a high number of coauthors ( degree centrality ) later becoming highly cited , this eﬀect would rather be dependent on more than just single network metrics . Finally , they attempted to predict whether a publication will be successful ( highly cited ) , based on the position of its authors within the co - authorship network . Interestingly , by means of machine learning models , citation counts representing the success of an academic publication were in fact anticipated by the social location of its authors ; such predictions achieved a precision of 60 % which is impressive , considering that a random guess would only discern the same eﬀect with a 10 % precision . 2 . 5 . 2 Proximity and the Interaction between Scholarship and Innovation Rather than dealing with academic citations , the works in this section deal with proximity dimensions when an interaction between science and industry exists . Citations are sometimes used to study this collaboration activity , rather than being the main target of these analyses . Mostly , products resulting from innovation ( such as patents ) are addressed , though in occasion , the collaborative links between scholars and inventors are inspected , and it is common to include institutional or organizational characteristics . Instead of cognitive proximity , technological distance is addressed , though they are close enough to consider ﬁndings in this dimension relevant . For instance , Liebeskind et al . ( 1996 ) studied the exchange of scientiﬁc knowledge in biotechnology patents at the organization and individual levels , in terms of the scholarly publications authored by scientists belonging to two companies , and their patent count . Despite concluding that social networks played a critical role in organizational learning by providing ﬁrms with access to knowledge generated by academic research , 32 they did not adopt a structural network approach to account for collaboration proximity . Furthermore , Schummer ( 2004 ) targeted the cognitive , geographical , and institutional dimensions by applying coauthor analysis to 600 papers from eight journals dealing with nanosciences . He developed indexes for these proximities based on categorical scales for discipline , institution , and the geographic region of the paper . As for the cognitive aspect , a publication was considered to be interdisciplinary when its coauthors belonged to more than one discipline . His ﬁndings indicate that nanotechnology research shows only an average degree of interdisciplinarity , and that it does not diﬀer much from academic practices in sciences and engineering regarding intercontinental and interinstitutional academic collaboration . Also , compared to both the interdisciplinarity and the interinstitutional index , the geographic collab - oration index generally appears quite low ; further , each geographical region seems to have its particular nanoscale research proﬁle ( e . g . Europe focuses more on physics and electrical engineering , whereas North America aims at chemistry , biomedical , and mechanical engineering ) . Anyhow , the number of papers au - thored by scientists from at least two diﬀerent continents remarked on the high degree of international exchange in the ﬁeld . From the literature dealing speciﬁcally with the eﬀect of geographical proximity , the works by Cun - ningham and Werker ( 2012 ) and Frenken et al . ( 2010 ) have some resemblance in that they considered a more speciﬁc categorization for location than Schummer ( 2004 ) ; further , they took collaborations between organizations and scientists extracted from the WoS database , and also , they both dealt with organizational proximity . These two works investigated the impact of spatial proximity on collaboration on European coun - tries , in terms of its success ( as reﬂected by citation counts ) , and intensity ( shown in co - published works count ) respectively . Nevertheless , Cunningham and Werker ( 2012 ) also included a more direct depiction of geographical distance , as did Boufaden and Plunket ( 2007 ) , Gittelman ( 2007 ) , and Delemarle et al . ( 2009 ) , by measuring spatial distance itself , with the sole diﬀerence among them that Boufaden and Plunket ( 2007 ) converted it into a weighted matrix of distances and nearest neighbors . Moreover , these last three authors assessed this proximity on widely diﬀerent representations of science - industry collaboration : patent application counts of 60 companies in biotechnology ( Boufaden and Plunket , 2007 ) , collaboration linkage expressed by citations by papers and patents , also in biotechnology ( Gittelman , 2007 ) , and scientiﬁc production described by nanotechnology publication counts of clusters based on highly - cited cities ( Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , the diﬀerent nuances in their ﬁndings on the importance of geographical proximity is not surprising , despite all of them having found it signiﬁcant . In this regard , spatial closeness is meaningful for global knowledge production because of the high number of publications produced at spatially concentrated clusters ( Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) ; plus , nearly - situated research teams tend to publish papers later cited in the ﬁrms’ 33 patents , whereas dispersed teams publish articles that are more highly cited in scholarly works ( Gittelman , 2007 ) . Additionally , due to also measuring technological proximity , Boufaden and Plunket ( 2007 ) found that being geographically close to patenting companies ( whose employees come from an academic background ) from related technology specializations does explain patent application counts . Likewise , spatially clustered organizations augment collaboration intensity , but not as highly when the institutions are technologically proximate ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . On the other hand , according to Frenken et al . ( 2010 ) , physical proximity would be more inﬂuential in some industries more than in others to achieve a successful interaction between scientiﬁc sources ( university ) and the industry : their results reveal that the citation impact of research collaboration is higher at the international level than at the scale of national and regional collaborations . Moreover , in a more recent study by Bouba - Olga and Ferru ( 2012 ) , traveling time ( by train ) , along with a location category , was chosen instead of purely spatial distance to signify geographical proximity . This time , a set of 32 , 764 scholar - inventor links was used to denote spatial impact on collaborations between ﬁrms and scientiﬁc laboratories from various disciplines in France . Interestingly , ﬁndings from this work indicate the still present signiﬁcance of geography , allegedly conﬁrming spatial dynamics in science - industry collaboration , though its inﬂuence extent would depend on the specialization of the research team . Similarly , Laursen et al . ( 2011 ) addressed spatial distance ( by a grid - based metric and location scale as well ) on the likelihood of establishing a collaboration link between 8 , 724 ﬁrms and 99 universities in the UK . However , they found that geographical distance plays a subtle role in shaping university - industry collaboration , given that other aspects ( such as collaboration quality and the university type ) revealed greater importance than spatial closeness when it comes to choose partners to collaborate with . Besides , though not directly addressing this dimension , the fact that the type of university was more inﬂuential than geography was is taken to signify a trade - oﬀ between cognitive and spatial proximity ( Laursen et al . , 2011 , p . 24 ) . By the same token , Wang and Guan ( 2011 ) employed information from the USPTO ( United States Patent and Trademark Oﬃce ) to quantify collaboration intensity , as measured by citation links between 1 , 447 articles in nanotechnology research and 275 Chinese inventions ( patents ) . The study concerned technological proximity by inspecting the diﬀerent application ﬁelds of the scientiﬁc and technology products , as well as the impact of collaborative proximity . For this purpose , three networks were built ( coauthor , coinventor , and both combined ) and SNA was applied to them to inspect the position of the individuals ( degree centrality ) and gather overall metrics of the network ( nodes , edges , components , density , and diameter ) . Their results suggest that knowledge production and diﬀusion is improved by the strong interaction between science and technology discerned in nanotechnology , by means of the author / inventor positions as well as their application ﬁelds . 34 Finally , Eslami et al . ( 2013 ) also measured collaborative proximity by inspecting the co - authorship net - work of 100 , 652 papers and 4 , 893 patents in Canadian biotechnology . Said inﬂuence was assessed on their research productivity and technological performance through paper and patent counts respectively , by means of the network structural properties . From the SNA metrics analyzed , the degree and betweenness centrality revealed substantial inﬂuence on knowledge and innovation creation . Still , we must mention that betweenness centrality only presented a signiﬁcant eﬀect due to the combi - nation of the scientiﬁc and technological aspects in a single network ; further , Eslami et al . ( 2013 , p . 17 ) indicate that only when research eﬀorts may translate into industrial applications , this metric displays its power of controlling knowledge ﬂows in the network . In addition , small - world properties were also found signiﬁcant , particularly the clustering coeﬃcient , which denotes a high “cliquish” network structure and would enhance knowledge creation ( this result dis - proved previous claims as to the opposite ) . Altogether , their results suggest that the structure and indi - viduals’ properties and interconnections within the collaboration network correlate to both knowledge and innovation production . 2 . 5 . 3 Proximity Inﬂuence on Patent Citation In the preceding discussion , citation is sometimes used as proxy for science - technology collaboration . How - ever , we make a clear distinction between analyzing citations from scientiﬁc publications versus citations in works produced either by the industry or academic entities ( like universities ) , but which have an economical purpose . We now consider proximity eﬀects in terms of citation behavior when targeted solely from the veriﬁed products of innovation : patents . Throughout the innovation literature , we ﬁnd that the impact of geography on patent citation has been the proximity dimensions most commonly measured . To begin with , Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg ( 1999 ) explored the citation intensity between 50 , 000 pairs of patents ( taken from the USPTO database ) , by considering the eﬀect of country location on citation frequency and probability . They aﬃrmed that geographic localization is signiﬁcant for knowledge diﬀusion , having found that patents with inventors in the same country are 30 to 80 % more likely to cite each other than inventors from other countries . Plus , they discovered that having pairs with the same technological class is decisive for there to be a citation link among the two , with this likelihood being 100 times greater than in patents pertaining to diﬀerent classes . Similar ﬁndings by Hu and Jaﬀe ( 2003 ) reveal that among 59 , 116 patents , those being technologically proximate are preferred for citing to distant patents from another ﬁeld . Finally , they discerned that knowledge diﬀusion ( as measured by citation count and frequency ) would display diﬀerent macro - level patterns according to the inventor’s country of residence . Further analyses by Breschi and Lissoni ( 2003 ) , Singh ( 2005 ) , and Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) chose instead 35 to take a closer look at geographical distance than mere country to conﬁrm whether they had the ability to increase the likelihood of an existing citation link between patents . Besides spatial distance , all three targeted the collaborative dimension as well by inspecting the structure of the co - inventor network . In this regard , Breschi and Lissoni ( 2003 ) used the inventor’s location category ( based on intra - national boundaries ) to match Italian patents from the European Patent Oﬃce ( EPO ) into 3 , 716 co - located patent links . To realize how closely related were inventors in the co - patenting network , they focused on the structural metrics of “know - who” ( shortest path ) , “conectedness” ( network component ) , and mobility ( betweenness centrality ) . Their results revealed that localization eﬀects tended to disappear when the co - located citing / cited patents were not additionally linked by any network relationship . Thus , they claimed that geography is not a suﬃcient condition for knowledge diﬀusion , instead requiring an active participation by inventors within a network of knowledge exchanges . Moreover , while betweenness centrality and shortest path were both found to be signiﬁcant , a high shortest path value ( meaning a more indirect connection ) would oﬀer much less inﬂuence than the betweenness of inventors . Diﬀerently , Singh ( 2005 ) considered the metropolitan area the inventors belong to , while Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) quantiﬁed distance in miles ( transformed ) ; both works relied only on a shortest path scale to assess collaborative proximity . They both addressed pairings of citing and potentially cited patents from United States to measure the probability of a positive citing connection . According to their ﬁndings , interpersonal networks expressed by collaboration ties are indeed important for knowledge diﬀusion by increasing the likelihood of eﬀective citation links among inventors . Further , such probability decreases as the shortest path length increases ( Singh , 2005 ) ; giving socially proximate inventors a greater advantage over distant ones for gaining knowledge ( Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . Nonetheless , the eﬀect of geography , as expressed by regional boundaries , decreases once interpersonal ties have been accounted for , implying that being in the same region has little to zero impact on the citing probability among inventor pairs already closely connected by network ties ( Singh , 2005 ) . Therefore , geographical proximity is regarded as a moderate inﬂuential factor on the citing likelihood between patent pairs , hence agreeing with Breschi and Lissoni ( 2003 ) . In a later analysis Singh and Marx ( 2013 ) followed a similar methodology to the one employed by Singh ( 2005 ) , with the diﬀerence that spatial aspects were quantiﬁed by three metrics of geographical proximity : a geopolitical level category based on the inventor’s city , a ﬂag value for when inventors are in the same state , and by distance measurement in miles . They conclude that both country and state limits had positive independent eﬀects on knowledge diﬀusion beyond the ones displayed by geographic proximity in the form of metropolitan collocation or shorter distances in the same region . By the same token , Sonn and Storper ( 2008 ) focused on the citation counts between 17 , 761 patent - pairs 36 from the US and discovered that American inventors displayed an increasing tendency to cite local patents at three geographical levels : country , state , and metropolitan . Their results suggest that inventors choose domestic knowledge , that is , they prefer national sources , over foreign knowledge . In addition , even though a preference over in - state knowledge was found signiﬁcant , it was rather weak , meaning that inventors do not really care if their citation sources are from out - state , as long as it is domestic ; plus , they would adopt knowledge from the same metropolitan area more than from outside sources . Similarly , Agrawal et al . ( 2008 ) adopted a co - location category based on metropolitan area levels as well as Euclidean measurements to account for the spatial distances between inventor - patent - citation linkages from the US and Canada . We ﬁnd it interesting that a purely social proximity aspect was considered , in terms of a co - ethnicity class that categorized inventors as Indian or non - Indian according to their names . Their ﬁndings reveal that both the spatial and social proximity dimensions increase the probability of knowledge ﬂows between inventors . However , only socially distant inventors would beneﬁt from geographic closeness ; spatial and social proximity thus become substitutes for being an inﬂuential factor on knowledge access . Moreover , by means of controlling for patent technological class , they conclude that being members of the same technical community helps spatially - dispersed inventors to gain access to knowledge . Finally , it is noteworthy to mention that although measuring technological proximity was not their main purpose , those authors in this section who did not directly inspect its inﬂuence still accounted for the cognitive aspect . Indeed , most aimed to remove its eﬀect and assess other aspects independently by using patent technological class as control variable as Agrawal et al . ( 2008 ) did . 2 . 5 . 4 Research Gaps Although one could argue that , overall , research related to knowledge production making use of citation analysis and collaboration networks has been well documented in the multiple studies discussed above , many of them have either been conducted only with bibliometric approaches , or with a special focus on patents data , having institutions as their publication source . It becomes evident that the literature predominantly deals with proximity concerns involved in innovative citation , or even its collaboration with scholarly communities but without really exploring their impact on citation ; studies on scientiﬁc citation are , as a matter of fact , rather scarce . Further , the inﬂuence of geography has only been examined on academic citation when innovation is implicated . Moreover , all of these works are based on either one proximity dimension or combinations of them , but never all three aspects together . Indeed , to our knowledge , there is no study dealing with the geographical , cognitive , and collaborative dimensions combined in a single analysis , let alone for exploring citation impact , on academic literature . 37 The only one we could ﬁnd that addressed all three dimensions was Cantner et al . ( 2013 ) , though we did not expand on their ﬁndings due to their focus being the behavior that would lead inventors to choose partners to establish a cooperation link with , without addressing any citation aspect . Findings by Radicchi et al . ( 2008 ) show that citations follow a similar distribution pattern , independently of the discipline they belong to . Whereas this could suggest that the mechanisms behind citation practices are universal across ﬁelds , citation practices seem to generally diﬀer signiﬁcantly in accordance with their scientiﬁc discipline ( Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) . As a result of this tendency , where knowledge bases would vary according to their industry ( Malerba , 2005 ) , knowledge ﬂows would be inﬂuenced and display characteristic patterns depending on their sector of science ( Gertler and Wolfe , 2006 ) . Therefore , another important aspect to highlight is that there has been no analysis executed in Canada which solely concerns the inﬂuence of proximity aspects on scientiﬁc collaboration in nanotechnology research . Even if Cunningham and Werker ( 2012 ) indeed targeted several types of proximity for European nan - otechnology , the use of social networks was merely suggested as ground for further studies . Throughout the literature , we have examples of studies applying collaboration network analysis for scientiﬁc publica - tions localized in Canada , but they are either outside the realm of nanotechnology , rather focusing on other branches of science ( e . g . Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) ; plus , sometimes the research was more geared towards business economics ( e . g . Schummer , 2004 ; Eslami et al . , 2013 ) , or even at a macro level ( e . g . Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) . Additionally , works dealing with SNA concerns on nanoscience knowledge production seem to be aggre - gated analyses that consider academic networks only from a high - level perspective ( see Onel et al . , 2011 ) or having a very limited scope ( see Rafols and Meyer , 2007 ) . In conclusion , there are signiﬁcant gaps in the literature on knowledge production and its ﬂow speciﬁ - cally from a scholarly standpoint , in light of the few studies that have been performed with this approach . Moreover , we ﬁnd the need to inspect knowledge - generating networks at the micro level of the academic com - munity , exploring the attributes of its individual members . Thus , we assert the relevance of this research , seeking important insights about proximity factors and their eﬀects concerning scientiﬁc citation . 38 2 . 6 Research Questions The preceding discussion enables us to pose the questions detailed below , which motivate the research reported here . In the ﬁeld of Canadian nanotechnology , 1 . Is cognitive proximity between two scholars a strong inﬂuencing factor as to increase the probability of an existing citation link among them ? 2 . Does geographical proximity between two researchers have impact enough to result on an increased probability for the establishment of a citation link among them ? 3 . Does collaborative proximity , as measured by the location of two authors within a co - authorship network , have an eﬀect on the probability of a citation link between them ? We expect to ﬁnd evidence - supported answers to our research questions throughout this thesis . We now go in detail about the data , methods , and tools used to obtain our answers in the next section . 39 CHAPTER 3 Methodology The literature has discussed many approaches that emphasize the importance of proximity for academic research and knowledge exchange and production . Recall that the theoretical proposition is that authors who are proximate to peers within scientiﬁc communities are more likely to result in paper citations , which in turn capture their impact on knowledge spill - overs . On these grounds , we will focus throughout this work on ﬁnding out how close the studied scholars are to each other . We shall also apply the know - how of social network analysis to the collaboration networks drawn out from articles specialized in the ﬁeld of nanotechnology . According to Gay and Dousset ( 2005 ) , the study of networks requires a delineation of explicit temporal and spatial boundaries . Thus , we circumscribe our research within a Canadian setting in the last 5 years . 3 . 1 Research Design The research design is quantitative with a correlational strategy , making use of research papers by scholars publishing about nanotechnology . The purpose of the design is to measure the level of interaction between the proximity amidst referenced authors and Canadian authors , and the probability of being cited by the latter . In our analysis , we explore several dimensions of proximity as the explanatory parameters for justifying citations , which can be relational as well as non - relational . Relational metrics correspond to a speciﬁc pair , and must be evaluated using both authors . However , we also introduce non - relational variables , which 40 describe attributes pertaining speciﬁcally to the cited author . The study has been conducted in two phases . During the ﬁrst phase , we develop methods to eﬀectively measure the deﬁned proximities . This stage also includes constructing the collaboration network of scientists , where social network analysis is performed to gather relevant network indicators . All these metrics are collected as input for the second stage of our work . In the second phase , the association between the proximity distances and eﬀective citation links is ex - amined . The latter phase comprehends a quantitative method using both statistical analysis and machine learning classiﬁcation , based on the data obtained from the previous phase . 3 . 2 Data This section deals with describing in detail the tools and steps taken to select the participants in our analysis . 3 . 2 . 1 Instrumentation The programming languages used throughout this project were mainly PHP and Javascript , running on a XAMPP ( Apache Friends , 2015 ) web server . Plus , we employed statistical , modeling , and network analysis software , which are speciﬁed later on , following the various procedures in data collection and analysis . In the end , our ﬁnal sample is stored in MySQL database ( Oracle , 2015 ) , with a table structure that can be found in Appendix B . 3 . 2 . 2 Setting and Participants Tracking publications in academic journals has largely been viewed as the easiest and most relevant measure of scientiﬁc knowledge production ( Delemarle et al . , 2009 ; Callon et al . , 1986 ) . However , nanotechnology being an emerging and highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld , scholars in the literature have raised the concern of counting with a proper data set for its study ( Schummer , 2004 ; Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) . Among these challenges are the lack of a speciﬁc tag for nanotechnology in many traditional databases , such as the Web of Science ( WoS ) , and the fact that words including the term “ nano ” do not exclusively refer to nanoscience publications ( e . g . “ nanokelvin ” . Fortunately , to answer our research questions we make use of a data set extracted from the SCOPUS database by another research team member ( Moazami , 2012 ) , who used specialized keywords related only to nanotechnology to select relevant academic papers , while also ﬁltering out those with misleading terms such as “ nanosecond ” . This data set was cross - referenced with WoS ( Web of Science ) database to obtain further paper details , such as the scientiﬁc ﬁeld of the article . 41 Thus , our original data set consists of 578 , 907 articles published in the period from the late 1900s to 2012 and written by a total of 538 , 780 authors ( 2 , 501 , 343 total authors records ) . We also have 2 , 174 , 607 cited articles written by 2 , 025 , 080 cited authors ( 12 , 515 , 392 cited authors records ) , leading up to 6 , 308 , 727 citation links between these articles . Our database also includes speciﬁc details about the article , such as the location of the scholars and the article’s publication year . The data was originally provided in 6 diﬀerent ﬁles in CSV format as follows , linked together by using the paper IDs and the author order : (cid:2) Papers (cid:2) Authors (cid:2) Addresses (cid:2) Cited Papers (cid:2) Cited Authors (cid:2) Cited Addresses We propose to conduct an empirical analysis with a subset of this database by adopting complementary strategies , which we will deﬁne in a further section . 3 . 2 . 3 Data preparation and Sampling We link scientists in pairs or “dyads” , which is the basic unit of analysis in social network theory ( Gittelman , 2007 ; Jawed et al . , 2015 ) . To this respect , Butts ( 2008 , p . 2 ) points out that relations need to be deﬁned as pairs of entities , with a qualitative distinction serving to discern present vs absent relationships . Hence , we gather proximity distances between these pairs , and use a citation link as the distinction of the type of relationship , similarly to the work by Cantner et al . ( 2013 ) on patent applications . Put simply , connected pairs of scholars are assigned to the positive class , while non - connected ones are assigned to the negative class ( Jawed et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , the statistical unit of our analysis is CC - REF pairs of nodes . We start by deﬁning these types of nodes , which we shall have in our ﬁnal data set , as follows : CC nodes : Citing Canadian authors who published at least one Canadian paper . REF nodes : Reference nodes , meaning authors of cited papers , who may or may not be cited by CC authors . These scientists can be from anywhere ( Canadian or non - Canadian ) . Throughout this research , we have established that a “ Canadian paper ” is an article with at least one Canadian scientist among its authors . CC nodes Our focus is on studying the citing behavior of Canadian scholars , and we have limited our research to only consider Canadian authors publishing in the most recent years . 42 You may refer to Figure 1 to see the count of Canadian publications vs the total of articles per year . As you can see , year 2012 has signiﬁcantly less papers than previous years , hence , we assume that the data was extracted sometime during that year , and thus is considered as incomplete and not useful for our analysis . Consequently , we shall work with 3 , 981 papers published by Canadian scientists during 2010 and 2011 . 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 39 , 512 43 , 118 53 , 279 52 , 186 60 , 723 57 , 232 17 , 116 1 , 318 1 , 404 1 , 721 1 , 780 1 , 956 2 , 025 537 Number of Articles Total Canadian Figure 1 : Nanotechnology articles per year We use the information on author aﬃliation as a proxy for geographical location , and thus we are able to identify Canadian - based scientists . The number of authors with Canadian addresses per year is shown in Figure 2 below . In total , we have 4 , 887 possible Canadian scholars ( CC nodes ) . Total = 4887 Year 2011 = 2734 Year 2010 = 2681 2206 2153 528 Figure 2 : Canadian authors publishing in 2010 and 2011 43 REF nodes Let us now take a look at the REF side of the pairing . We have set the time window for our research to be the last 5 years . Thus , we shall evaluate the citing behavior of the CC nodes against cited authors from 3 previous years respectively . In this case , we shall pair up Canadian scientists from 2010 and 2011 , against cited authors from 2007 to 2010 , and dismissing year pairs like : CC 2011 - REF 2011 , and CC 2010 - REF 2010 , so that no pair is from the same year . Throughout our whole database , we have 6 , 308 , 727 citation records , matched to the 2 , 174 , 607 unique cited papers for the complete time range . These cited papers are authored by 2 , 025 , 080 unique scientists ( corresponding to 14 , 847 , 753 records due to repeated citations of the same paper ) . As previously mentioned , our working range for cited scholars is between 2007 and 2010 . Therefore , we shall consider the authors from the 395 , 051 cited papers published between 2007 and 2010 , which gives us a total of 467 , 794 cited scholars ( corresponding to 1 , 375 , 611 records in our database ) . The counts of cited articles and authors in the studied period may be found in Figure 3 . 2007 2008 2009 2010 223 , 741 194 , 746 174 , 156 155 , 057 117 , 178 110 , 506 97 , 517 69 , 972 5 , 929 7 , 049 9 , 185 7 , 892 1 , 207 1 , 572 1 , 926 1 , 672 Number of Articles Total authors Total articles Authors cited by CC Articles cited by CC Figure 3 : Cited articles and authors per year 44 Sampling method Let us assume for a moment that we are to study every possible combination between our CC nodes and the REF nodes for the selected period . With over 400K cited authors , this would give us over 2 billion pairings ( 2 , 286 , 109 , 278 to be exact ) . It is evident then that some sampling method is required . Consequently , we decided to make use of R ( R Core Team , 2015 ) , a statistical computing software , to create our sample from the REF side , and then pair up combinations with our CC authors . First , we identiﬁed all the REF authors with at least one citation link to a CC author , by adding an extra column ( Citing ) with a boolean value . With this identiﬁcation , we were able to establish that during the period of 2007 to 2010 , only 26 , 987 authors have at least one citation connection to a Canadian author from 2011 and 2010 , while the majority ( 440 , 807 authors ) does not have this citation link . The fact that the amount of cited authors with a positive citation link is very little ( 5 . 77 % ) when compared to the population of all cited authors , could represent a potential issue at the moment of sampling . The proportion for cited authors with and without this citing connection is depicted in Figure 4a . Then , we ran a trial by taking a normal random sample with a size of nearly 12 % of the total population ( n = 54 , 000 ) , which resulted in 50 , 765 non - linked scholars vs 3 , 236 of positively linked authors ( 94 % vs 6 % ) . While we could say that this sample is pretty representative of our REF population , it is clear that having so little number of observations with the citing connection we want to study becomes a hindrance . It follows that random sampling is not practical for our purposes because actual citation links between CC and REF authors are very rare , making meaningful estimation impossible even if we took a large sample ( Singh , 2005 ) . However , modifying data distribution by simply undersampling the majority class could negatively aﬀect the results of later analysis , given that the distribution of the resulting data set would no longer present the same challenges as the real - world distribution ( Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , as sampling methodology we followed the SMOTE ( Synthetic Minority Over - sampling Tech - nique ) algorithm , which was developed by Chawla et al . ( 2002 ) , and implemented in R through the DMwR library ( Torgo , 2010 ) . This algorithm is useful for highly imbalanced data sets , and it has been used in several ﬁelds and for various purposes , such as network intrusion and fraud detection , medical imaging intelligence ( Padmaja et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ; Zhao et al . , 2009 ) , and notably , link prediction in social networks ( Munasinghe and Ichise , 2011 ) . SMOTE oversamples rare events by creating additional synthetic observations of that event , while at the same time undersampling the population majority that does not contain the desired eﬀect . The deﬁnition of rare event is usually attributed to an outcome or response variable that happens less than 15 % of the time in the whole population ( Amunategui , 2014 ) . With 5 . 77 % of positive REF scientists , it follows that we are dealing with a “rare event” . 45 We ﬁnd similar need for a balanced sample with both cases ( citing and non - citing ) in the literature , particularly for the study of knowledge diﬀusion by making use of citation links between patents ( Singh , 2005 ) . In their case , a choice - based sampling theory called Weighted Exogenous Sample Maximum Likelihood ( WESML ) is implemented to address this requirement . Similarly , Lichtenwalter et al . ( 2010 ) overcomes imbalance by applying SMOTE , stating it is one of the best sampling strategies for highly skewed class distributions , especially for researchers dealing with link classiﬁcation . To sample our data with SMOTE , we followed the guide by Amunategui ( 2014 ) as reference to write an R script to create our sample , which appears in Appendix C . 1 . The SMOTE sample left us with a quite balanced observation set of 27 , 014 non - linked authors vs 26 , 987 linked authors ( 50 . 02 % vs 49 . 98 % ) . ( a ) Population ( b ) SMOTE Sample 5 . 77 % 94 . 23 % Positive Negative 41 . 8 % 58 . 2 % Figure 4 : Proportion of citation links of REF authors between 2007 - 2010 As our next step , we created the combinations between our CC nodes and the REF authors from the sample . Since we have no speciﬁed path between the non - linked REF scientists and the Canadian authors , to pair these up we used an algorithm to randomize these combinations , whereas for the positively linked scholars , we followed the respective citation records . Although authors favor their own papers for citing , which has been deemed as a beneﬁcial factor in citation counts by others ( Bethard and Jurafsky , 2010 ) , we left out all self - citing links because we consider them uninteresting for our research goals . Besides , self - citations are naturally more geographically localized ( Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg , 1999 ) , so including them could favorably bias the eﬀect of the spatial dimension . As result , there were 116 , 256 potential author combinations generated , however , we observed that some authors among them were missing their aﬃliation information , hence lacking an address that would allow measuring geographical proximity . 46 After discarding records with missing information , we were left with 80 , 091 author pairs ( approximately 70 % of the original sample ) , from which 41 . 8 % ( 33 , 477 combinations ) are positively linked , that is , there exists an actual citation connection between them , and 58 . 2 % ( 46 , 614 combinations ) have a negative , or non - citing connection ( or “control” citation links ) . This proportion is depicted in Figure 4b . Finally , our working sample of 80 , 091 pairs consists of 2 , 824 Canadian papers published between 2010 ( 59 , 621 pairs ) and 2011 ( 20 , 470 pairs ) , authored by 3 , 747 distinct Canadian scholars ( CC nodes ) , and 34 , 877 reference papers published between 2007 and 2010 , authored by 47 , 380 distinct REF scientists . The number of pairs per reference year can be seen in Figure 5 . 2007 2008 2009 2010 33 , 257 21 , 694 17 , 853 7 , 287 Number of Pairs Figure 5 : Author pairs per cited year 3 . 3 Proximity Measuring The present section discusses the various methods used in the literature to measure each of the proximity factors . In addition , we introduce consequential metrics of each proximity aspect , also detailing the process followed to collect their respective data . 3 . 3 . 1 Measuring Cognitive Proximity Cognitive proximity measurement in the literature We have observed in the literature that there is no predeﬁned way to quantify interdisciplinarity ( and thus , cognitive proximity ) all authors can agree with ( Bordons et al . , 2005 ; Rafols et al . , 2010 ) . It would seem that this is partly due to the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of interdisciplinarity each one has , thus inﬂuencing the system of disciplinary categories used ( Schummer , 2004 ) . Consequently , we see heterogeneous methods in their work , starting from the basis taken for the analysis . On one hand , seeking a satisfactory measure for cognitive distance among ﬁelds has led some authors in the literature to come up with their own classiﬁcation of disciplines ( e . g . Schummer , 2004 ; Rafols and Meyer , 47 2007 ; Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . On the other hand , we ﬁnd examples adopting pre - existing ﬁeld categorization systems ( e . g . Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg , 1999 ; Boufaden and Plunket , 2007 ; Rafols and Meyer , 2010 ) , such as the patents classiﬁcation of the IPC ( International Patent Classiﬁcation ) ( WIPO , 2015 ) . For instance , Jaﬀe ( 1989 ) came up with a correlation coeﬃcient ( cosine index ) to measure the closeness between two companies , based on the distribution of the technology ﬁelds corresponding to their respective patents . Likewise , Malerba et al . ( 1998 ) built up on this approach , by analyzing the frequency of co - occurrence of IPC codes assigned to individual patents . This would be an indicator of the connection strength between the knowledge bases derived from the technological areas behind those classiﬁcation codes . Nonetheless , these cases are rather taken as quantifying technological proximity , since they involve technological publications regarding innovation rather than purely cognitive ﬁelds . On the contrary , the work of Rafols et al . ( 2010 ) concerns the degree of disciplinary diversity , by employing ISI ( Information Sciences Institute ) subject classes and cluster analysis to categorize research topics . Still , nanoscale research being such an ambiguous ﬁeld , its placement could vary among diﬀerent classiﬁcation systems due to the vagueness of its deﬁnition ( Schummer , 2004 ) . Regarding the subject of study , we usually ﬁnd the focus given to the interactions between patents or scientiﬁc publications , in terms of keyword or ﬁeld co - occurrences , authors’ aﬃliations , or citation links between disciplines . In the last case , the analysis would be geared towards the ﬂow of information between the distinct disciplines of the authors’ cross - disciplinary reading ( Schummer , 2004 ) . Moreover , an alternate approach has been to classify papers according to the specialization of the journal they are published at ( Katz and Hicks , 1995 ; Leydesdorﬀ and Zhou , 2007 ) . However , one drawback to this method would be that it becomes hard to distinguish multidisciplinary articles when they are published in general journals like Science or Nature ( Schummer , 2004 ) . Furthermore , Schummer ( 2004 ) criticizes the above mentioned approaches , by stating that these factors would only investigate the cognitive aspect of interdisciplinarity in terms of information . Therefore , he proposes studying interdisciplinarity based on co - author analysis , particularly for the domain of nanoscience , due to the combination of both cognitive and social aspects found in this type of relationship . He argues that usually , the co - authors’ disciplinary aﬃliation would correspond to their disciplinary knowledge contribution , and thus it would grant a better grasp on interdisciplinary research . Contrarily , Rafols and Meyer ( 2007 ) warn about collaborations among diverse disciplinary aﬃliations not always being an accurate indicator of interdisciplinarity . In their work , they take research projects as the unit of analysis , and compare the ﬁndings from the cognitive practices of academic research ( in this case , citations and references ) , and the social dimension ( by using aﬃliation and researcher practical background ) . In conclusion , they found that citation - based indicators better capture the generation of cross - disciplinary knowledge in nanotechnology , than through the tracking of co - authors’ aﬃliations . In a posterior study , 48 the use of these two approaches to quantify disciplinary diversity was combined with network coherence analyses , thereupon obtaining a clearer picture of knowledge integration ( Rafols and Meyer , 2010 ) . Similarly , Leydesdorﬀ and Zhou ( 2007 ) also draw conclusions about the interdisciplinarity level of nanotechnology - related journals from network indicators . In sum , the quantiﬁcation of cognitive proximity and their relation with interdisciplinarity would greatly depend upon the deﬁnition one has about these key concepts in the ﬁrst place . Metrics and data collection of cognitive proximity In the literature we ﬁnd that the ﬁeld or subject categorization by a scientiﬁc database is often adopted to measure cognitive proximity ( e . g . Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg , 1999 ; Boufaden and Plunket , 2007 ; Rafols and Meyer , 2010 ; Rafols et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , in our data the article information that could help identifying its scientiﬁc ﬁeld provided is the journal it was published in , the article’s domain , ﬁeld , and subﬁeld . These correspond to the categorization system from the Thomson Reuters WoS ( Web of Science ) database . We have observed that the domain is the same for all the papers , in this case : Natural Sciences and Engineering . The full list of the categories belonging to the data in question can be found in Table 11 in Appendix A . 1 . For this proximity factor , we discern only one metric applicable in our case : Cognitive category We expect to get a sense of interdisciplinarity in our citation set by creating a categorical scale of “closeness” between the cognitive ﬁelds and subﬁelds of each author in the pairing . Refer to Table 3 for the cognitive category scale we have deﬁned . Value Description 1 Same subﬁeld ( same ﬁeld as well ) 2 Same ﬁeld ( diﬀerent subﬁelds ) 3 Diﬀerent ﬁelds Table 3 : Cognitive distance scale We make the assumption that the ﬁelds and subﬁelds of an article apply to all of its authors , even though the ﬁeld and subﬁeld information in the database pertain to the paper , rather than speciﬁcally to the author . Reason for this is that we do not have particular information about the scholar’s scientiﬁc ﬁeld of interest , nor their department within the respective institution . Also , we noticed that cited papers older than 1980 do not include the ﬁeld and subﬁeld attributes , instead having an “Unknown” label . Still , we disregard this lack of information as we do not work with papers from these years . 49 Our method for obtaining cognitive distance is pretty straightforward . First , based on the IDs of both the article and the reference ( cited ) paper , we fetched the cognitive ﬁeld and subﬁeld information corresponding to the publication , and stored it to our combinations table . Next , we developed a simple program to compare the ﬁelds and subﬁelds between the two authors , and calculate the cognitive distance according to our predeﬁned scale . The obtained results are found in Figure 6 . We can observe that the great majority of non - citing pairs come from diﬀerent ﬁelds ( 48 . 15 % ) , while the citing pairs have a more even distribution among the categories . It would seem that citing pairs display an important preference for the same subﬁeld ( category value of 1 ) , as compared to the non - citing pairs .

Reason for this was that the category values are not too numerically distant from each other , which could potentially inﬂuence our analysis . Also , it gives us the ﬂexibility to measure each category on its own . Dummy Variable Value 1 Value 0 cog 1 Same subﬁeld Not same subﬁeld cog 2 Same ﬁeld Not same subﬁeld cog 3 Diﬀerent ﬁeld Not diﬀerent ﬁeld Table 4 : Cognitive distance into dummy variables 50 3 . 3 . 2 Measuring Geographical Proximity Geographical proximity measurement in the literature When measuring geographical proximity , there are basically two ways to go when it comes to the data as ground for the analysis . While some studies have adopted an approach of surveys for data collection ( e . g . Lublinski , 2003 ; Laursen et al . , 2011 ) , the majority we have seen makes use of existing formal databases , such as the Web of Science , in the case of academic publications , or databases from government patenting oﬃces , like the USPTO ( United States Patent and Trademark Oﬃce ) , or the EPO ( European Patent Oﬃce ) . We have previously made the distinction in the various deﬁnitions of what exactly is meant by geograph - ical proximity , and how it is typically decomposed into physical or Euclidean distance and functional or travel distance . First , we focus on the Euclidean , or a purely spatial distance . The methods used vary greatly , ranging from archaic measuring of accurate scale maps ( Katz , 1994 ) , to using specialized software applications as GIS ( Geographic Information System ) ( e . g . Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) . The primary concern that comes when trying to quantify distance is which address information to use , and that is directly related to the data set to be used . In the scenarios where formal scholarly databases are the data source , the data provides the aﬃliation information for every author , but it could happen that this address may not be the place where the study was done ( because a scientist could change their aﬃliation , or publish using the address of the research facility headquarters ) ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ; Eslami et al . , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , the aﬃliation is forcefully the only pointer available to assess the place where the actual research was carried out . Hence , the aﬃliation of the authors is customarily taken as a proxy for their geographical location . As a next step , researchers are usually required to perform geocoding , which refers to the translation from an address to its precise location coordinates ( longitude and latitude ) . We have reviewed some works in which the data included zip codes of the organizational aﬃliations of the individual authors ( e . g . Gittelman , 2007 ) . In some cases , there is no exact location speciﬁcation and scholars are forced to ﬁnd alternate ways , such as taking a general postal area for the calculations ( Laursen et al . , 2011 ) . In other cases , they count with speciﬁc geographical data for every address , and can get to be more precise in their computation of distances . Some examples of the precise measurements are addresses being geocoded by using Google Earth ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) , or using GIS engines such as MapPoint ( Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) . We now get to the functional aspect of measuring distance , which is associated with the transportation method and the actual time it would take to travel from point A to point B . In spite of the arguments stating that travel time has a high correlation to Euclidean measurements of distance ( Phibbs and Luft , 1995 ) , increasing measurement precision might be necessary according to the 51 research being performed ( Jones et al . , 2010 ) Also , because it could be important to account for the impact of topological considerations ( like mountains , rivers , etc . ) and the transportation pathway networks ( Jones et al . , 2010 ) . Another reason would be to avoid the potential for bias for the cases when straight line distance is not an accurate reﬂection of the travel time it requires ( Phibbs and Luft , 1995 ) . In any case , any Euclidean measurement is always equal to or lesser than a functional distance measurement , though the magnitude of this diﬀerence is unknown ( Jones et al . , 2010 ) . We ﬁnd in the literature that some authors have taken travel time by train ( Bouba - Olga and Ferru , 2012 ) for their functional proximity calculations . However , is it common to consider vehicles as the transportation means , in which case driving time would be the factor to use , like the case of Jones et al . ( 2010 ) , in which he combines the distance traveled over a road network with Dijkstra’s algorithm ( Dijkstra , 1959 ) to pick out the shortest path . Moreover , it is not uncommon for studies performed in this area to include a categorical variable that provides a way of ranking distance , such as creating their own classiﬁcation or scale of geographical unit ( Sonn and Storper , 2008 ; Bouba - Olga and Ferru , 2012 ) . Some examples are the grouping of addresses into geographic clusters ( Delemarle et al . , 2009 ) , or making use of existing nomenclature standards , like EU geocode standard NUTS ( Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . Metrics and data collection of geographical proximity To measure geographical proximity , we follow Cunningham and Werker ( 2012 ) and decompose it into physical proximity ( referring to Euclidean or spatial distance ) , and functional proximity ( referring to the traveling time existing between two authors ) . Euclidean distance This metric refers to the straight - line distance or metric between two points in Euclidean space , in this case , the locations of the two scholars , denoted in kilometers . It should be noted that this a measurement is in “as the crow ﬂies” or “in a beeline” kilometers , meaning that it is the shortest distance between two geographical coordinates on a map , disregarding terrain considerations . Note : This parameter is also referred to as “ﬂying distance” . To calculate spatial proximity , we followed a methodology similar to the one applied by Cunningham and Werker ( 2012 ) . However , since our data set did not contain postal codes within the aﬃliation address , specialized geocoding software could not be used to easily convert them into coordinates ( latitude and longitude ) , so we had to develop new methods . To gather the required location information to calculate Euclidean distance , we ﬁrst extracted the aﬃli - ation address of each author . We wrote code for this mapping , since they were situated in diﬀerent tables , 52 linked together by the article id and the author order . The address shown in Figure 7 corresponds to the ﬁrst author ( order = 1 ) of article id # 8325 , as an example of an aﬃliation record in its raw format in the addresses table . Institution : CARNEGIE - MELLON - UNIV City : PITTSBURGH Province : PA Country : United States Figure 7 : Example of aﬃliation record in raw format Next , we wrote several scripts of programming code to pass this address information to the web services oﬀered by Google Maps , in this case , the Geocoding API ( Google Inc . , 2015 ) . As stated in their developers website , geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates . The screenshot in Figure 8 shows our script obtaining sets of coordinates for each address , per the responses obtained from the Geocoding API . Figure 8 : Script querying Google Maps Geocoding API The response from Google Maps also allowed us to obtain complete geographical details along with the coordinates , as can be seen in the output depicted in Figure 9 . We store all the returned details in a table created speciﬁcally for this purpose , which contains a unique identiﬁer for each found address , so that there are no unnecessarily repeated records for the same location . Nonetheless , cleanup was required for problematic addresses where , for instance , the institution name would be incomplete or acronyms would be used instead . In some cases , Google Maps indeed recognized the address , and returned the correct full institution name , along with the rest of the details . In some other 53 cases , it was not recognized , and it returned an empty value . To solve this , we created several scripts to ﬁlter information and reuse geolocation data before hitting Google Maps again , since the web service limits the hits per day allowed in the free license version . The ﬁrst ﬁlter code compared records with valid geocode details versus not - found addresses and associated the same location data to the missing one , provided that they had at least 60 % similarity in their institution name ﬁeld ( string comparison ) and that the city , province , and country were the same for both . Address long name : Carnegie Mellon University , 5000 Forbes Avenue Locality ( city / town ) : Pittsburgh Administrative Area Level 2 ( province / state ) : Pennsylvania Postal Code : 15213 Country : United States Latitude : 40 . 4424925 Longitude : - 79 . 94255279999999 Figure 9 : Google Maps response output Even though this initial ﬁlter populated the majority of the missing geocoded addresses , there were a few left that still were not found ( such as empty institution names , or institution containing one or two uncommon acronym characters ) . For these cases , we had to use the “next best scenario” and gathered the geolocation information by using the city name instead , for which Google Maps returns the coordinates of the middle point in that city . Although for some particular cases of big cities it might not be as accurate , we consider it is still a good indicator for the spatial position , particularly when the target location is distant from the CC node . For instance , we found a higher probability of this happening in Asian locations due to misspellings . Nevertheless , this ﬁlter should not aﬀect much the results , since , for example , the distance from a Canadian point will not vary greatly from point A to point B in a North Korean city , yet allowing us to measure an approximate spatial separation between the two researchers . After applying these ﬁlters , we have the coordinates for all the authors in our sample . Finally , we obtain Euclidean distance by using an implementation algorithm of the Haversine formula ( GeoDataSource . com , 2015 ) , which calculates the distance in kilometers between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes by taking into account the radius and curvature of the Earth . Refer to Figure 10 for the distribution of Euclidean distance in our sample . Traveling time For the next step in our process , we collect the traveling time between scholars to have a more complete view of geographical proximity , per the literature . The time factor is collected from two diﬀerent methods of 54 Euclidean Distance 20000 15000 10000 5000 0 F r e qu e n cy 5 , 000 . 0 4 , 000 . 0 3 , 000 . 0 2 , 000 . 0 1 , 000 . 0 0 . 0 CitingNon - citing Citing Figure 10 : Distribution of Euclidean distance transportation : plane and vehicle . Consequently , we initially divide time into two sub - metrics : Flying time and Driving time , which are later combined in a single variable : Traveling time . All time parameters are denoted in the format of hours , minutes , and seconds ( hh : mm : ss ) . It is important to note that driving time will only be calculated when the Euclidean distance between two authors is less or equal to 500 Km . In the literature , some authors studying the inﬂuence of spatial distance on collaboration have used the threshold of 100 miles ( approx 160 Km ) as maximum distance indicator for preferring travel by car over ﬂying ( Laursen et al . , 2011 ; Bouba - Olga and Ferru , 2012 ) . However , in Canada we ﬁnd people choosing to drive for distances greater than this , for instance , from Montreal to Quebec City ( around 250 Km / 160 miles ) , or even outside their province , like from Montreal to Ontario ( around 500 Km / 310 miles ) . Therefore , we set our limit to be 500 Km as the maximum distance for which scholars would choose to drive . For all remaining distances greater than 500 Km , we make the assumption that an author would choose to mobilize to the location using an airplane as means of transportation . To measure ﬂying time we make use of the already calculated Euclidean distance , and as for speed , we make the airplane model assumption of a Boeing 747 aircraft with a cruising speed of 885 Km / h ( Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia , 2000 ) . Although we acknowledge that for local ﬂights the aircraft model might be diﬀerent ( resulting in other speeds ) , it still serves as a useful baseline for reference . Next , we ran a programming script that uses the basic speed formula of time = distance / speed to obtain the ﬂying time in seconds , which was later converted to time format ( hh : mm : ss ) and stored in our database . Note that this time parameter is based on “as the crow ﬂies” distance between two points , which means that it is not taking into account actual travel times or local amenities such as stop - over times , connections with diﬀerent cities , delayed ﬂights , customs waiting times , among other factors . This variable aims to 55 CALCULATING TRAVEL TIME Euclidean distance traffic conditions local flights international flights driving time if flying time if > 500 Km + 3 hours + 5 hours < = 500 Km “best guess” Figure 11 : Selection of transportation mode provide a reference for traveling time rather than being an exact travel measure in itself . Nevertheless , we make some adjustments to our ﬂying time factor , and allocate reasonable extra time to account for the time it takes to get to the airport , average waiting times before a ﬂight , and to get from the arrival airport to the ﬁnal destination ( Torres et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , we apply post - processing following these considerations : for local ﬂights , we add 3 extra hours , and for international ﬂights , 5 extra hours . Figure 11 sums up the conditions to select the transportation method . Recall the assumption that for Euclidean distances less or equal to 500 Km , a scholar will drive to the destination , whereas for longer distances , a scientist will prefer to travel by plane . For this reason , we calculate driving time only for all pairs meeting this distance condition . To this purpose , we wrote a programming script that queried the Google Maps Distance Matrix API web service ( Google Inc . , 2015 ) to obtain driving time . This Google Maps web service provides travel distance and duration for a set of origins and destinations , in our case , we pass the latitude and longitude values previously collected for each author . The output returned is based on the recommended route between start and end points , as calculated by the Google Maps engine , as depicted in the screenshot in Figure 12 . 56 Figure 12 : Script querying Google Maps distance API Even though there are several options for mode of transportation ( such as train or public transportation ) , we select “driving” , which indicates travel calculation using the road network . In addition , Google Maps allows for ﬁne tuning in the travel estimations , like the inﬂuence of traﬃc conditions on the result , for instance , “optimistic” or “pessimistic” traﬃc . Regardless , we decided to use the default setting of “best guess” traﬃc , which is the best estimate of travel time , deeming both historical traﬃc conditions and live traﬃc . In the end , we combine both of our traveling sub - variables into one , obtaining a consolidated metric for traveling time . Refer to Figure 13 for the distribution of traveling time measurements in the sample . Location category We ﬁnd in our review of previous research that some authors include a ranking tool that serves for classifying geographical distance besides the pure spatial measurement , also taking into account geopolitical boundaries ( e . g . Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . Hence , we include this factor in our variable framework , and classify according to the diﬀerence or likeness in the geopolitical location between the two scientists in the dyad . Thus , our location categorization variable is rated according to the scale deﬁned in Table 5 . 57 Traveling Time 25 : 00 : 00 20 : 00 : 00 15 : 00 : 00 10 : 00 : 00 05 : 00 : 00 00 : 00 : 00 F r e qu e n cy 5 , 000 . 0 4 , 000 . 0 3 , 000 . 0 2 , 000 . 0 1 , 000 . 0 0 . 0 CitingNon - citing Citing Figure 13 : Distribution of Traveling Time Value Description 1 Same city / town 2 Same state / province 3 Same country 4 Same continent 5 Diﬀerent continent Table 5 : Location category scale As mentioned earlier , an additional beneﬁt to ﬁnding the precise location coordinates by using Google Maps is that it also returns the address updated in a correct format . For example , we observed that some records in the data lacked the province ﬁeld , or in occasions , they had obsolete geopolitical information like : Union of Soviet Socialist Republics instead of Russia , Federal Republic of Germany , or Czechoslovakia . In the last case of these , according to the speciﬁc location , Google Maps would return either Czech Republic or Slovakia as the country info , following further information in the address . In the end , this was useful for our location category metric , which depends on country , state or province , and city / town information being stored properly to be able to compare and grade according to the deﬁned scale . However , we still lacked continent information , since Google Maps does not provide this attribute . Hence , we wrote a short program to assign the continent according to the country , per the seven - continent model below , which is the most common . 58 (cid:2) Europe (cid:2) Asia (cid:2) North America (cid:2) South America (cid:2) Africa (cid:2) Oceania (cid:2) Antarctica Lastly , we created a script that compared the geopolitical ﬁelds between the two authors , and assigned the location category according to the scale mentioned in Table 5 . The distribution graphs for our geography - related variables appears in Figure 14 . As we did with cognitive distance , we also transform location category into ﬁve binary or “dummy” variables ( see Table 6 ) . Dummy Variable Value 1 Value 0 loc 1 Same city Not same city loc 2 Same province Not same province loc 3 Same country Not same country loc 4 Same continent Not same continent loc 5 Diﬀerent continent Not diﬀerent continent Table 6 : Location category into dummy variables Finally , we have all the geographical measurements for each author pair which will allow us to validate our hypothesis about spatial proximity . Now we go to the next step , and take a look into the attributes related to the social network formed by the scientists . 3 . 3 . 3 Measuring Collaborative Proximity Collaborative proximity measurement in the literature To obtain a picture of the collaborative proximity between researchers , we make use of the full co - authorship network between every author publishing in our working time range . The metrics used for this purpose are obtained from social network analysis applied to the co - authorship network . SNA : Social Network Analysis Social Network Analysis ( SNA ) is a methodology , rather than a formal theory in itself , for analyzing social networks , providing a set of statistical techniques for the study of their structure , which is why sometimes it is referred to as structural analysis ( Wellman and Berkowitz , 1988 , p . 20 ) . A social structure can be represented as a network consisting of a set of entities ( the members of the social system , called vertices or nodes ) , and a set of ties showing their interconnections ( usually called edges ) 59 Location Category Differentcontinent Samecontinent Samecountry Sameprovince Samecity C oun t 50 , 000 40 , 000 30 , 000 20 , 000 10 , 000 0 CitingNon - citing Citing Figure 14 : Distribution of location category ( Wellman and Berkowitz , 1988 ; Newman , 2001b ; Butts , 2008 ) , which can be visualized with a variety of graphs ( Marion et al . , 2003 ) , like the one in Figure 15 . SNA originated under the inﬂuence of various ﬁelds , such as sociometrics , mathematics , and computer science ( Otte and Rousseau , 2002 ) . Based on a mathematical graph theory , SNA has become a multi - disciplinary approach with applications in many ﬁelds like sociology , information and computer sciences , geography , among others ( Otte and Rousseau , 2002 ; Marion et al . , 2003 ; Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ) . There are several parameters used to portray the characteristics of a complex network , such as calculating the network’s diameter , or various centrality measures such as eigenvector centrality and clustering coeﬃcient . According to the literature , the most important centrality measures are considered to be degree centrality , closeness centrality , and betweenness centrality ( Otte and Rousseau , 2002 ) . These network parameters mostly convey the way a node relates to the rest of the other nodes in the graph , while others , such as the shortest path between two vertices , may reveal features at the micro level ( Ding , 2011 ) . Moreover , SNA does not only consider people for its nodes , as is the case of Leydesdorﬀ and Zhou ( 2007 ) , where the betweenness centrality of journals dedicated to nanotechnology was used as a measure of interdisciplinarity in the ﬁeld . We remark on how network parameters may reﬂect on the node signiﬁcance and value in terms of knowledge generation . For instance , a scholar with high level of connectivity ( degree centrality ) and a key position within the network , has greater potential at performing better in knowledge creation and diﬀusion ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Similarly , research results by Sarig¨ol et al . ( 2014 ) indicate that several co - authorship centrality metrics can indicate citation success ( when considering its interactions rather than a single network 60 Figure 15 : Example visualization of a network graph Source : La connaissance est un r´eseau ( Grandjean , 2014 ) measure ) . Particularly , we ﬁnd that SNA is highly useful to study the structural relationships within the co - authorship network of an academic knowledge base , having several examples of this in the literature ( see Newman , 2001b , 2004 ; Barab´asi et al . , 2001 ) . Metrics and data collection of collaborative proximity The complete database of the Canadian nanotechnology articles published in our working time range ( 2007 - 2010 ) has been employed to build the scientiﬁc collaboration network . We base the collaboration aspect on the co - authorship relationships between all the scholars participating in the period . Note that we do not build the network only with the authors present in our sample , since this would limit our view on the existing connections between scientists . For this part of the analysis , we refer to the studied authors in the network terminology given to an indi - vidual entity , that is , as nodes or vertices . In addition , a co - authorship link would constitute a bidirectional relationship , hence its network graph would constitute an “undirected” graph , built with undirected edges ( represented as simple lines without direction ) as connections . First , we had to prepare the existing data to show the co - authorship relationships for every article , given that there was one record per scholar / article . Therefore , we used a script that combined all the authors for each article in a single line separated by comma , which we exported to CSV format . The reason for this pre - processing was to conform our data to the Scopus format used by the Sci2 software , for which we only 61 used three of the format ﬁelds : article id , comma - separated co - authors , and year . The Science of Science ( Sci2 ) Tool ( Sci2 Team , 2009 ) is a software that provides tools speciﬁcally designed for the study of scientiﬁc networks , such as geospatial , topical , social networks , allowing for the analysis and visualization of scholarly data sets . Afterwards , we loaded our data into Sci2 ( refer to Figure 16 ) , and extracted the co - authorship network , which consisted of an output ﬁle containing the lists of nodes and edges corresponding to our collaboration network from 2007 - 2011 . Figure 16 : Screenshot of Sci2 software Due to our network size , we had to run Sci2 on a Linux virtual machine ( Fedora 23 Workstation version , 64 - bit ) , due to the Java memory limitations when used on a Windows environment . Finally , we saved the extracted network to a CSV ﬁle , consisting of 674 , 113 nodes ( authors ) and 6 , 067 , 065 edges ( co - authoring relationships ) . Furthermore , the software displayed information about the extracted network in its console , among which we can observe that although there are 4 , 410 isolated nodes , our network is not weakly connected , with 94 . 87 % of the nodes ( 639 , 573 in total ) being part of the largest component ( also called giant component ) . The complete output can be seen in Appendix E . 1 . Moreover , the Sci2 software has in - built functionality that provides direct connection to visualization software such as Gephi ( Bastian et al . , 2009 ) , which displays network graphs and allows applying layout algorithms , among other functionality . However , our complete co - authorship network is too big ( over 6 million edges ) to obtain a good visualization . Nonetheless , we are able to retrieve the following general information by using the Network Analysis Toolkit ( NAT ) option of Sci2 , which helps us get an overview of our network , as depicted in Figure 17 . To inspect the collaboration network structure and obtain the SNA - based proximity values , we use two 62 Network Average Degree : 18 . 00014241 Network All Degree Centralization = 0 . 00935385 Watts - Strogatz Clustering Coefficient : 0 . 74904137 Network Clustering Coefficient ( Transitivity ) : 0 . 13400960 Network Diameter : From Quinto - et ( 925 ) to Meissner - ka ( 314063 ) is distance 14 ( longest shortest path ) Figure 17 : Network overview from Sci2 popular network analysis applications , Pajek version 4 . 06 ( Batagelj and Mrvar , 1998 ) and NetworkX version 1 . 10 ( Hagberg et al . , 2008 ) , which is a library based in the Python programming language . First , after uploading our co - authorship network ﬁle in Pajek , we ran the Network ⇒ Info ⇒ General option , which returned some of the general values already obtained from Sci2’s Network Analysis Toolkit ( see Appendix E . 1 ) . Refer to Figure 28 in Appendix E . 2 for Pajek’s output with general network information . In terms of our network setting , the total published articles authored by each author become a node’s weight , with the total works co - authored by a pair of nodes representing the weight of the edge or connection between the pair . However , all the SNA factors are computed without considering weight parameters . As the next step , we went in Pajek to Network ⇒ CreateV ector in the menu , and proceeded to run the diﬀerent options to obtain the network metrics , which are brieﬂy introduced below . Most of them were calculated relatively quickly , whereas some others ( betweenness and closeness centrality ) took 10 days each to complete . It is noteworthy to mention that all the parameters measuring individual characteristics of a node pertain to the “target” or reference node ( REF ) , in this case , the cited author . The only exception is the shortest path , which instead refers to pairs of scholars . Shortest path A fundamental concept in graph theory , a geodesic is the shortest path of vertices and edges that links two given nodes ( Newman , 2001a ) . In other words , the shortest path represents how many “steps” or authors are between two researchers tied up by co - authorship links with their peers . This variable is based on the implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm ( Dijkstra , 1959 ) for ﬁnding the shortest path , without considering weights . Typically , the distance between authors is short , with only a few steps in the shortest path between them . For the case when the two speciﬁc scholars have collaborated in a publication , they would be direct neighbors , and the shortest path would be 0 . It is relevant to mention that there might be no path between the nodes at all , in which case we set this value to a representation of inﬁnite ( 9999 ) ( Newman , 2004 ) . 63 Degree centrality The degree centrality of a node is deﬁned as the number of nodes that are connected to that node . In other words , this parameter is the sum of all of the node’s directly connected neighbors . When an author is “central” , it has often been taken as an indicator of that author’s popularity in the network . Betweenness centrality This centrality measures how often is a node located on the geodesic or shortest path between other nodes in the network . Since by deﬁnition betweenness centrality is normalized as the proportion of all geodesics that include the particular node , it can also be expressed as a percentage . A node’s betweenness would express its average capacity to control the ﬂow of information in the network ( Uddin et al . , 2011 ) . The idea of this parameter is that if a node with a high level of betweenness were removed , the network would fall apart into coherent clusters ( Leydesdorﬀ and Zhou , 2007 ) . Hence , nodes acting as proxies to join diﬀerent clusters would have a high betweenness value . Closeness centrality This parameter is the average of the shortest path distances between a speciﬁc node and all the other nodes in a network . Hence , this value would only be available for connected nodes . Closeness centrality would expand on the concept of of degree centrality by emphasizing how close a node is to all other nodes in the network ( Uddin et al . , 2011 ) . As a result , the more central a node is , the lower its total distance from all other nodes is going to be . Eigenvector centrality Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the centrality of its neighbors basing on the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of an adjacency matrix . This centrality metric relates to the inﬂuence of a node in the network by assigning relative scores to every node . The idea behind this concept is that links to nodes representing authors with high scores contribute more to the score of that particular authors than links to low - scoring authors . Unlike degree centrality , which considers every node equally , eigenvector centrality weighs nodes according to their centralities . Since this means taking into account not only direct connections but indirect links as well , eigenvector would be a centrality measure considering the entire network pattern ( Bonacich , 2007 ) . Clustering coefficient Social networks are inclined to form cliques , or tight groups with individual nodes highly tied together ( Watts 64 and Strogatz , 1998 ) . Thus , this coeﬃcient measures the degree of the clustering tendency of a particular node in a network , by making use of the links to all the other nodes in the system . In a co - authorship network , the clustering coeﬃcient of a node represents the willingness of this node’s collaborators to collaborate with each other , indicating the probability that two of its collaborators wrote a paper together ( Barab´asi et al . , 2001 ) . Roughly speaking , this metric stands for how well connected the neighborhood of the node is , thus revealing its “cliquishness” . If the node’s neighborhood is fully connected , the clustering coeﬃcient of such node would be 1 . Contrarily , a value close to 0 would mean that there are hardly any connections in that node’s neighborhood . Moreover , networks with a high clustering coeﬃcient and a low mean shortest path meet the criteria for being considered small - world networks , referring to the phenomenon in which two strangers often ﬁnd that they have a friend in common ( Watts and Strogatz , 1998 ) . This feature is typically exhibited in any human social network : in any cluster of friends , each friend is also connected to other clusters , thus usually taking only a short string of acquaintances to connect any two people on earth .

In particular , for degree centrality the majority of scholars seem to have a small number of coauthors , whereas a few scientists in the network have collaborated with many or even hundreds in some cases ( Newman , 2001b ) . Although Pajek provides a way to get the shortest path length matrix , which calculates the geodesics for every edge in the network ( option Geodesics Matrices ) , this operation is only available for small networks . Another way would be to calculate the shortest path between two nodes through manual input of the nodes identiﬁers . However , we need to compute the shortest path between all of the pairs in our sample , and this 65 large number makes it unfeasible for us to use Pajek for this purpose . Therefore , we had to use the scripting capabilities of NetworkX to obtain the shortest path between a speciﬁc set of nodes in our sample . The Python script we created to gather the geodesics by using NetworkX can be found in Appendix C . 2 . As previously stated , coauthors in the networks would have a 0 value for shortest path ; however , NetworkX assigns direct neighbors a shortest path value of 1 instead . Moreover , we deﬁne in our code an alternative value of “9999” to be used as the shortest path between scientists who are not connected , to avoid getting errors when running the script . We shall discuss later how we declare these as “missing values” for our analysis . Figure 18 shows the distribution for the shortest path parameter ( note that missing values have been excluded from the graph ) . As the ﬁnal step in the data collection concerning collaborative proximity , we imported the resulting SNA measurements to MySQL and mapped the values back to its corresponding author , keyed by the node id , a number assigned to each scientist by Sci2 . 3 . 4 Data Analysis In this section we start with an overview on the methods employed to analyze the various proximity factors involved in citation behavior . Then , we state the null hypotheses , summarizing as well the variables to be used in the analysis , which are based on the metrics discussed in the previous section . Finally , we implement the presented procedures with our data . 3 . 4 . 1 Regression and Classiﬁcation Modeling Data scientists and scholars in general dealing with quantitative research analyze data seeking to learn from it and be able to draw conclusions of various natures . The desired conclusions may range from descriptive or explanatory ( like discovering occurring patterns ) , to predictive conclusions , such as categorical classiﬁcation ( Getoor , 2005 ) . In particular , we ﬁnd that there has been a growing interest in learning from structured data , deﬁned as data forming a graph where the nodes are objects and the edges in the graph are links or relations between objects ( Getoor , 2005 ) . Notably , citation links constitute a form of structured data that indicates relationships concerning the behavior of formal knowledge and its ﬂow . The Merriam - Webster Web Dictionary ( 2014 ) deﬁnes classiﬁcation as the systematic arrangement in groups or categories according to established criteria . In machine learning and statistics , classiﬁcation is the problem of identifying which class ( also , category or sub - population ) a new observation belongs to , on the basis of a set of data containing observations ( also called instances or cases ) whose class is known ( Michie 66 et al . , 1994 ) . A class is thus deﬁned as an outcome that must be predicted from known attributes . In short , classiﬁcation is identifying group membership . From the numerous approaches taken towards the task of classiﬁcation , there are three main distinct lines of research addressing this goal : statistical analysis , machine learning , and neural networks ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . Throughout the literature , we ﬁnd that two of these major branches for classiﬁcation are applied in the study of citation analysis when considering its inﬂuential factors : statistical approaches and machine learning . Given the categorical nature of a citation link ( i . e . citing vs non - citing ) , it follows that we face the problematic of its correct classiﬁcation . In terms of machine learning , classiﬁcation has two distinct meanings ( Michie et al . , 1994 ; Alpaydin , 2014 ) : (cid:2) Unsupervised learning ( or clustering ) : When the classes or clusters are not known in advance , and they need to be construed from the data itself ; and (cid:2) Supervised learning : When we know a priori the set of classes , and the goal is to establish a rule by which to classify a new observation into one of the existing classes . Sometimes in statistical literature supervised learning is also be referred to as discrimination , where the importance resides in following classiﬁcation rules drawn from given correctly classiﬁed data ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . From this point forward , whenever we refer to classiﬁcation , we shall consider its deﬁnition with regard to supervised learning , i . e . , when the outcome classes are already known . Regression Statistical approaches rely on explicit probability models , providing observations with a probability for being in each class , rather than classifying them ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . For this reason , scientists studying the behavior of scholarly publications tend to use traditional statistical approaches and tools , such as linear discrimination analysis ( LDA ) or binomial logistic regression . Particularly , statistical models based on regression techniques that account for main eﬀects allow testing whether factors have incidence on a dependent parameter , being able to distinguish between those that do have some correlation and those constituting noise ( Lemon et al . , 2003 ) . For instance , linear regression has been applied to discern future number of citations by means of authors’ reputation ( Castillo et al . , 2007 ; Yan et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , with regression modeling we can assess the inﬂuence of statistical interactions among indepen - dent factors , while also having each factor as part of the model ( Lemon et al . , 2003 ) . Given that regression models are widely known in the academic realm , we do not explore their conceptual basis in depth , rather proceeding to discuss the other method of interest : classiﬁcation in terms of machine learning . 67 Classiﬁcation : Machine Learning Link prediction is an important task in network science , characterized by mining tasks performed on academic data with the goal of discovering patterns and factors to achieve such predictions . Data mining has greatly beneﬁted from advances in methodology since the mid - 1980s , with the academic community creating and increasingly improving the predictive accuracy of machine learning algorithms Breiman ( 2003 ) . A subﬁeld of computer science , machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building . It consists in algorithms that learn from data through their ability to independently adapt with each iteration , ﬁnding hidden insights without human intervention nor instructions of where to look ( Michie et al . , 1994 ; SAS Institute Inc . , 2015 ) . This technique is commonly used to extract useful information from large data sets , to later display it in simple and comprehensible visualizations of the relationship between the input variables ( the observed attributes or features ) and the responses ( the pre - deﬁned class ) ( Breiman , 2001 ; Song and Ying , 2015 ) . We focus on supervised learning ( which is the most widely adopted machine learning method ) , where the learning algorithm shapes the model through a set of inputs and outputs by comparing its actual output with known correct outcomes to ﬁnd errors , modifying the model accordingly ( SAS Institute Inc . , 2015 ) . With prediction usually as the main goal of data analysis ( Neville , 1999 ) , supervised learning algorithms use methods like classiﬁcation and regression to identify patterns that enable them to make such predictions . Moreover , any environment naturally mapping to a network would have an equivalent mapping from link prediction applied on that network back to a key factor in the environment ( Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 , p . 1 ) . Accordingly , they attempt to make the classifying expressions simple enough to be understood easily by humans , mimicking human reasoning reasonably enough as to provide useful insights into the decision process ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , they learn a ( classifying ) task from a series of examples by means of automatic computing procedures based on logical or binary operations , and produce reliable and repeatable decisions and results ( Michie et al . , 1994 ; SAS Institute Inc . , 2015 ) . From their broad applicability in diverse ﬁelds , we feature their application in the study of the behavior of scholarly data , for which we ﬁnd several examples . For instance , Getoor ( 2005 ) made use of the structure of binary citation links to improve classiﬁcation accuracy . Furthermore , researchers throughout the literature propose numerous approaches to predict the number of future citations and their success ( based on the author’s h - index 1 ) amid scholarly work ( e . g . Hirsch , 2007 ; Dietz et al . , 2007 ; Acuna et al . , 2012 ) . Among these , we call attention to Dong et al . ( 2015 ) and his predictions for scientiﬁc impact and collaboration based on citation analysis and academic social networks . While there are many algorithms for supervised learning out there , we emphasize those used to analyze factor contributions in academic data . We ﬁnd that many authors in the literature make use of a logistic 1 The h - index is an index that attempts to measure both the productivity and impact of a scholar’s published works . 68 regression classiﬁer ( LRC ) ( see Getoor , 2005 ; Bethard and Jurafsky , 2010 ; Dong et al . , 2015 ) . In this case , the statistical analysis performed by logistic regression is used iteratively for training as a supervised classiﬁer . LRC is often implemented for classiﬁcation purposes due to their output consisting of linear combination of the variables with weights , which would provide insights on variable importance ( Breiman , 2003 ) In addition , other prominent models such as support vector machines ( SVM ) would also have the potential to produce accurate predictions . Yet , SVM is arguably better when applied to regression problems ( i . e . when the response variable is of continuous nature ) than for binary classiﬁcation ( Bethard and Jurafsky , 2010 ; Breiman , 2003 ) . In the same way , we reviewed models based on decision trees ( DT ) classiﬁers , which were introduced in the 1960’s ( see Neville , 1999 ; Dong et al . , 2015 ) . Decision trees are one of the most popular methods for data mining , due to their ease of use and interpretation , robustness even with missing values , and their ﬂexibility to use both discrete ( categorical ) and continuous variables ( Song and Ying , 2015 ) . Originating from decision trees , random forests ( RF ) algorithms ( Breiman , 2001 ) grow an ensemble of trees ( i . e . “a forest” ) and lets them vote for the most prominent class . Notably , RF are considered to be accurate classiﬁers , showing comparable or even better prediction performance than other learning methods ( Breiman , 2001 ; Xu , 2013 ) . They have been extensively used in classiﬁcation problems ( e . g . Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ; Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ; Dong et al . , 2015 ) , having led to signiﬁcant improvements in classiﬁcation accuracy ( Breiman , 2001 ) thanks to their particular advantages , such as robustness against overﬁtting ( a potential problem with decision trees ) . Decision Trees Decision trees ( DT ) are a powerful tool for classiﬁcation and prediction that operate through a series of rules based on parameter selection . These rules consist on logical ( IF - THEN ) expressions , and their output is displayed as limbs in the form of a tree , making up branches as they split from the root ( the dependent variable ) or older branches ( parameters or descriptors ) , and ﬁnally , the unsplit nodes constitute the leaves of the tree ( Neville , 1999 ; Tong et al . , 2003 ) . Ideally , the data in a leaf must be related to a combination between the split of the parameter value and the target measure , so that the tree represents the correct classiﬁcation of data into puriﬁed groups ( Neville , 1999 ) . The split rules would be easy to interpret intuitively as answers to questions concerning how does the association between descriptors aﬀect the response variable , as opposed to nonlinear “black box” algorithms like neural networks ( Neville , 1999 ) . This ease of interpretation makes this method appealing because of their clear depiction of how a few inputs determine target groups ( Neville , 1999 ; Tong et al . , 2003 ) . Typically , DT allow missing values , treating them as a special case , which lead them to constitute an additional branch within the split rules ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . In addition , the popularity of trees would also 69 be due to the ﬂexibility they provide in accepting diﬀerent variable types for both target and predictors : nominal , ordinal , and continuous ( Neville , 1999 ) . We already mentioned that trees are formed by “branching” or splitting nodes according to the input parameters , in the search of achieving purity of a speciﬁc class . Here , an ideal “purity” would be having a single class at each resulting node . The splitting criteria , namely , “impurity functions” , basically select the split that has the largest diﬀerence between the impurity of the parent node and a weighted average ( Lemon et al . , 2003 ) . Some examples of impurity functions are : Gini index , entropy , and minimum error . There are several algorithms based on the concept of decision trees , whose variations in construction and implementation have improving performance as goal ( Tong et al . , 2003 ) . The tree - growing procedure is similar for all the algorithms in that they all generate trees by recursively splitting the data into smaller and smaller subcategories . Among these , we ﬁnd QUEST ( Quick , Unbiased , Eﬃcient Statistical Trees ) , CHAID ( Chi - square - Automatic - Interaction - Detection ) , C5 . 0 ( and its previous versions ) , and CART ( or C & RT : Classiﬁcation and Regression Tree ) . We summarize the most popular DT models by comparing their features and operating mechanism in Table 7 ( see also Neville , 1999 ; Lemon et al . , 2003 ; Tong et al . , 2003 ; Song and Ying , 2015 ) .

Based upon chi - square statistics ( Lemon et al . , 2003 ) , CHAID recursively partitions data using splits that must achieve a threshold level of signiﬁcance : the chi - square test of independence between the nominal target values and the branches . It terminates when no more merges or re - splits are signiﬁcant . C & RT analysis ( also called CART ) is a decision tree methodology ﬁrst developed by Breiman et al . ( 1984 ) that examines all possible binary splits , and implements a sophisticated “pruning” mechanism to minimize misclassiﬁcation error and overﬁtting . CART uses a generalization of the binomial variance called the Gini index , and it is considered to be one of the best decision tree methods due to its selection of most inﬂuential 70 predictors ( Lemon et al . , 2003 ; Loh , 2011 ) . A commercial improvement over C4 . 5 algorithm , C5 . 0 works by splitting the data according to the ﬁeld that provides the maximum information gain ( entropy ) at each level ( Loh , 2011 ) . It is developed by Quinlan ( 2014 ) , and for the most part , C5 . 0 works and performs quite similarly to CART . One notable diﬀerence between them is that CART grows the tree based on a splitting criterion iteratively applied to the data , whereas C5 . 0 includes the intermediate step of constructing sets of rules . Generally , all DT methods ( excepting C5 . 0 ) , provide the investigator with some level of control by applying what is known as “stopping rules” . These allow the user to specify how large a tree to grow , and establish thresholds for statistical diﬀerences before declaring results as meaningful ( Lemon et al . , 2003 ) . Nevertheless , there are some weaknesses to decision trees , and the most noteworthy is that DT can be prone to overﬁtting , particularly when using small data sets . Overﬁtting is when the model ﬁts noise by way of paying too much attention to irrelevant data , and ends up “memorizing” training data instead of learning from it . For instance , if a decision tree were allowed to grow freely , it could classify the given data with 100 % accuracy , at the expense of creating a very complex tree - structure that would most likely not perform well on new data ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . This could potentially mean a high bias to the training set , and it would ultimately limit the generalization capability of the resultant model ( Song and Ying , 2015 ) . At any rate , Michie et al . ( 1994 ) suggest correcting or avoiding altogether the bias by using cross - validation and / or independent data samples : one to learn the classiﬁcation rules and another to test it . As a result , comparing the predicted vs the true classiﬁcations on the test data would give an unbiased estimate of the error rate for the tree classiﬁer . Furthermore , DT may not be the best tool to quantify the impact of a single independent variable on the outcome of interest . On one hand , since decision trees estimate average eﬀect , if the goal is to learn the impact of each parameter separately , DT should not be used as a substitute for regression techniques ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . On the other hand , this could be seen as an advantage , given that DT already discover interactions between variables without having to specify them as a separate formula ( in contrast to logistic regression ) . The nature of the tree would allow formation of interactions not by explicit operations on the variables , but through the tree structure itself . Lastly , decision trees are deemed by some to be unstable , and their sensitivity to multicollinearity between independent variables has been criticized . In fact , strongly correlated inputs may result in selecting variables that improve the model statistics but do not explain the response variable ( Song and Ying , 2015 ) . However , these two issues would be addressed by means of using ensemble methods such as bagging , or random forests , instead of relying on a single tree ( Breiman , 2001 ; Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ; Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) . 71 Random Forest A random forest is a classiﬁer formed by of a collection of tree - structured classiﬁers and developed by Breiman ( 2001 ) . In RF , a subset of predictors are randomly chosen at each node , and then split by using the best among them . After a large number of trees has been grown , each tree votes for the most popular class . Though the splitting strategy might seem counterintuitive , it has been proven to increase classiﬁca - tion eﬃciency and performance , when compared to other classiﬁers such as SVM ( Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ; Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) . RF algorithm would provide various advantages , like allowing combining categorical with numerical variables ( Breiman , 2001 ) , overﬁtting prevention ( Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) , high scalability ( Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) , and ease of setup . Indeed , in this model , only two parameters need to be set : the number of variables used at each random subset , and the number of trees in the forest . Still , they usually have low sensitivity to these values ( Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ) , which means that RF models maintain their stability throughout diﬀerent parameter settings . Moreover , RF would be an eﬃcient method of variance reduction for large data sets , because they counter increased training time for the whole forest with decreased training time for each single tree ( Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) . In RF , the prediction error estimate is called Out - Of - Bag prediction error ( OOB error ) , which is the equivalent to the mean squared error in regression , and to misclassiﬁcation error in classiﬁcation ( Xu , 2013 ) . In general , the OOB estimate of error rate is quite accurate , provided that enough trees have been generated ( Breiman , 2001 ) . Besides , RF would eliminate the need for having separate cross - validation and further error estimation , because they already have these procedures as part of their internal classiﬁcation routine ( Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) . In terms of dealing with predictor dimensionality , RF estimate the variable importance by inspecting how much the OOB error increases when that parameter is permuted while all others are left unchanged ( Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ) . In the case of statistical techniques , such as logistic regression or the Cox model , the recommended practice is to delete less important covariates to reduce the dimensionality , or the resulting model might become unstable ( there would be too many competing models ) ( Breiman , 2003 ) . However , reducing dimensionality is not an easy task given that the importance of a variable might be related to its interaction with other variables ( Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ) . Indeed , RF has been known to yield accurate classiﬁcations for data with a large number of features ( Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , deleting variables would also decrease the amount of information available for prediction ( Breiman , 2001 ) . Never - theless , variable importance measures produced by RF are useful for model reduction by clearly identifying a few informative predictors and ignoring the other noise variables , with essentially the same prediction accuracy ( Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ) . 72 Finally , the main disadvantage of RF is the low interpretability due to its complex mechanism for pro - ducing a prediction . Indeed , “ trying to delve into the tangled web that generated a plurality vote from 100 trees is a Herculean task ” ( Breiman , 2003 , p . 10 ) . Yet , highly easy - to - understand algorithms might not make the most accurate predictors , and simplicity would have to be sacriﬁced to achieve greater accuracy ( Breiman , 2001 ; Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) . Prediction Models vs Statistical Approaches Arguably , the objective of statistics is to use data to obtain information about its underlying mechanism in order to understand it , and , as ultimate goal , being able to make predictions based on the conclusions drawn ( Breiman , 2003 ) . Contrarily , D . R . Cox , a prominent British statistician , admonishes in his comment on Breiman ( 2003 , p . 18 ) that emphasizing successful prediction as the sole objective does not go in hand with the pure goals of statistics : interpretation and understanding . However , Breiman ( 2003 ) criticizes that statisticians rely too heavily on assumptions and data modeling . Hence , their enthusiasm for ﬁtting data models would be a potential issue as data becomes more complex , and it needs modiﬁcations so it can ﬁt a model . As a result , the conclusions could turn out to be misleading in the sense that although they may pass goodness - of - ﬁt tests and residual checks , they would be about the model’s mechanism rather than the nature of the data . Likewise , Michie et al . ( 1994 ) bring to attention several practical problems like the removal of attributes ( if they are not high contributors to the discrimination ) and data transformation as well . Moreover , citation behavior may be diﬃcult to estimate using traditional regression analysis due to their intrinsically heavy - tailed distribution of citation counts ( Dong et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , it is assumed as a rule that human intervention is required to implement statistical techniques , especially in regards to variable selection and transformation , and overall structuring of the problem ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . Alternatively , the task of citation analysis can be formulated as a classiﬁcation problem ( Dong et al . , 2015 ; Jawed et al . , 2015 ) , to be solved with supervised learning techniques . Furthermore , link prediction is considered a well - known problem in ﬁeld of SNA , since we intend to guess the likelihood of the occurrences of connections between nodes ( Jawed et al . , 2015 ) . Another aspect to consider is the common inadequacy of regression to discern some relationships in data in social research , and the fact that classiﬁcation models like decision trees can easily get around it ( Neville , 1999 ) . Nevertheless , Michie et al . ( 1994 ) admonish practitioners of machine learning to assimilate and use statistical techniques as well , despite the ongoing debate between these two cultures . Reason for this would include , for instance , how decision trees should not be regarded as a substitute over proven statistical regression , in cases where the average eﬀect of parameters over a response variable wishes to be discerned ( Lemon et al . , 2003 ) . 73 3 . 4 . 2 Hypotheses and Variables Null Hypotheses We rephrase our research questions introduced in the previous chapter as null hypotheses , to be later assessed as statistical inferences . Importantly , we split the analysis of collaborative proximity into two sub - hypotheses . Null Hypothesis H 0 1 Citation probability does not increase when a Canadian author is cognitively prox - imate to another author . Null Hypothesis H 0 2 Citation probability does not increase when a Canadian author is geographically proximate to another author . Null Hypothesis H 0 3a The probability of a Canadian author citing another does not increase due to the referenced author’s position within the collaboration network . Null Hypothesis H 0 3b The probability of a Canadian author citing another does not increase if they are closely connected to each other within the collaboration network . Response Variable We study the impact of proximity on academic knowledge production through the performance measure of an existing citation link in a dyad , which is a pair of authors . The citation relationship is taken from the pairings , with this link expressed as a binary value ( i . e . yes / no represented by 1 and 0 ) . Per the literature , scientiﬁc citation probability can either be formulated as a regression problem ( the traditional approach ) , or alternatively , as a classiﬁcation problem to be solved with supervised learning techniques ( see Yan et al . , 2012 ; Jawed et al . , 2015 ; Dong et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , we adopt two distinct methodologies to conduct our analysis , given the boolean nature of our dependent variable : 1 . Binary regression modeling 2 . Machine learning - based classiﬁcation modeling Each method takes the citing behavior as the response or dependent variable , that is , if the citation link has been established or not . Independent Variables In like manner , we consider a set of independent variables based on the metrics representing collaborative proximity and general network attributes , as well as those representing cognitive and geographical proximity . Below we list the independent variables used in our analysis for testing each hypothesis . The variables are presented in the order of the hypotheses to whose validation they contribute . 74 1 . Cognitive proximity ( H 0 1 ) ( a ) Cognitive category 2 . Geographical proximity ( H 0 2 ) ( a ) Euclidean distance ( b ) Traveling time ( c ) Location category 3 . Collaborative proximity ( a ) Degree centrality ( H 0 3a ) ( b ) Betweenness centrality ( H 0 3a ) ( c ) Closeness centrality ( H 0 3a ) ( d ) Eigenvector centrality ( H 0 3a ) ( e ) Clustering coeﬃcient ( H 0 3a ) ( f ) Shortest path ( H 0 3b ) 4 . Control variables ( a ) Published works ( b ) Co - authored works Control variables We distinguished two particular parameters that could have an important eﬀect on citation probability . Hence , we consider them as control variables and also include them as independent parameters in our model . Published works This variable refers to the number of articles published by the target or cited author during the speciﬁed time period . Since we consider that a researcher that has published a high number of papers could be deemed prestigious in the ﬁeld , we expect the scientist to be highly cited by peers regardless of their proximity measurements . Co - authored works This parameter represents a simple count of the published works that have been co - authored by each pair of authors . It is likely that if two researchers have co - published scientiﬁc articles , they cite each other in their subsequent works . The output ﬁle of the extracted network previously obtained from Sci2 also contained the tabulated information for the number of authored works for each author , and the co - authored works for every pair of scientists , since they constitute the weight per node and per edge respectively . Thus , we collected the values for our control variables , whose distributions may be found in Figure 30 in Appendix E . 4 . Data Pre - processing Prior to running the analysis , we ﬁrst had to deal with repeated pairs of the same authors , given that our statistical unit is unique CC - REF node pairs . We found that in our sample , there were 538 pairs occurring more than once , usually repeated 2 times , and 4 times at maximum . Thus , for repeated pairs , we calculated 75 the means for scale variables , and for categorical variables , we chose either the most frequent category , or the highest one ( when there was no value occurring more often than the others ) . The resulting set contains 79 , 524 unique CC - REF author pairs , which will serve our goal of quantifying the impact from all proximity factors on the citation probability for unique pairs of authors . Finally , we have all the required information to go into the analysis stage of our work . 3 . 4 . 3 Applying Regression We use Stata ( StataCorp , 2015 ) , a data analysis and statistical software , to test the validity of our hypotheses through regression models . Importantly , we deﬁne the correct format for each variable ( e . g . time format hh : mm : ss for traveling time ) after uploading into Stata . In addition , we distinguish “missing values” in each variable , namely rows with a 0 value in closeness centrality ( isolate authors ) or where no shortest path existed ( 9999 value ) , so they can be excluded from further analysis . Descriptive statistics for the independent variables can be found in Tables 13 and 14 appearing in Appendix D . Correlation Analysis We know a priori that some of our independent variables might be inter - associated , such as travel time and Euclidean distance , or that high collinearity may exist between some centrality metrics ( Valente et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , we ﬁrst validate whether our variables are correlated or not . For this purpose , we use the most common correlation measure : the Pearson Product - Moment Correlation Coeﬃcient ( PC ) , which reﬂects the degree of linear relationship between two variables . Conventionally , variables are considered to be uncorrelated if PC < 0 . 1 , weakly correlated if 0 . 1 < PC < 0 . 3 , moderately correlated if 0 . 3 < PC < 0 . 5 and strongly correlated if 0 . 5 < PC < 1 . 00 ( Schiﬀauerova and Beaudry , 2011 ) . Figure 19 displays the correlation plot as a graphical representation . For the precise values , refer to Table 15 in Appendix D , which shows the correlation matrix with the coeﬃcients for each pair of independent variables . It is noteworthy to mention that all the correlations discussed here are statistically signiﬁcant , that is , they have a 2 - Tailed signiﬁcance value of less than or equal to 0 . 05 . We ﬁrst proceed to explore the correlation between explanatory parameters against the dependent vari - able . Cognitive category and shortest path were found to have a negative moderate correlation to the citing response , whereas the other proximity metrics displayed a weak correlation . In terms of the centrality metrics , we ﬁnd the weak linear correlation unsurprising due to similar ﬁndings by Sarig¨ol et al . ( 2014 ) . Next , we check correlations between our control variables and the rest of the independent parameters . Coauthored works was found to have a weak correlation to shortest path ( evidently , co - publishing pairs would always have zero hops in their shortest path ) , whereas published works is strongly correlated to the 76 −1 −0 . 8 −0 . 6 −0 . 4 −0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 C i t i n g C o g n i t i v e _ d i s t P u b _ w o r k s _ t a r g e t C o a u t h o r e d _ w o r k s S h o r t e s t _ p a t h D e g r ee _ t a r g e t B e t w ee n _ t a r g e t C l o s e _ t a r g e t E i g e n _ t a r g e t C l u s t e r _ t a r g e t E u c l i d e a n _ D i s t a n c e T r a v e l _ T i m e _ s e c L o c a t i o n _ C a t e g o r y Citing Cognitive _ dist Pub _ works _ target Coauthored _ works Shortest _ path Degree _ target Between _ target Close _ target Eigen _ target Cluster _ target Euclidean _ Distance Travel _ Time _ sec Location _ Category Figure 19 : Correlation Plot target author’s degree centrality , as well as to betweenness and eigenvector centrality . Now , among the independent variables involving the social network , we predictably found a strong correlation between degree and betweenness centrality , and to eigenvector and closeness centrality . Clustering coeﬃcient is in general weakly correlated to the rest of the SNA metrics , with the exception of a negative moderate correlation to the shortest path . Closeness centrality and shortest path have a negative moderate correlation between each other , while also being moderately correlated to degree centrality and clustering coeﬃcient , and a positive moderate correlation to location category . Moreover , as anticipated , there is a high correlation between Euclidean distance , traveling time , and location category . Even though the response variable is not strongly correlated to any of the studied proximity metrics , we do not take this as enough evidence to discard uncorrelated to poorly correlated variables . We consider the possibility that the correlations between response and predictors might not follow a linear relationship , which is the aim of the Pearson correlation analysis ; after all , linear correlation does not necessarily mean causation . In the end , we discard altogether the control variable of published works on account of its high correlation to degree centrality . As a matter of fact , this correlation was expected , as it is comparable to the correlation between number of collaborators and number of patents found by Schiﬀauerova and Beaudry ( 2011 ) : a scientist’s high number of co - authors would usually be related to an increased number of publications , unless said author would choose to continue working always with the same research group for all his / her published articles . Since these two parameters have the potential to account for highly proliﬁc authors , we cannot 77 control for the number of publications without removing the eﬀect of a scientist’s degree centrality . Finally , from the SNA metrics , we completely drop closeness centrality mostly due to being correlated with shortest path , besides correlating with the other centrality metrics as well . For the remaining centralities ( degree , betweenness , and eigenvector ) we decide to run the model using each one of them alternately at a time . In the same way , we shall assess the eﬀects of the geographical metrics ( Euclidean distance , traveling time , and location category ) by including them in the model by turns . Model Setup We implemented two regression models applicable for a binary response variable : Logistic ( Logit function in Stata ) and Probit . Logit uses the logistic distribution function , whereas the probit model employs a probit link function , both having an output based on probabilities as their predicted values , hence delimited between ( 0 , 1 ) . They are very similar in most cases , both using maximum likelihood estimation , and they are commonly used for the same kind of problems . Plus , these models are easy to interpret , enabling analysis for factor contributions and parameter settings ( Dong et al . , 2015 ) . Also , they are robust to small noise in the data and are not particularly aﬀected by mild cases of multi - collinearity ( Long and Freese , 2006 ) . Besides , Logit / Probit models have fewer assumptions than other types of analysis in that they make no assumption on the distribution of the independent variables ( Liao , 1994 ) . This means that since they can work with skewed distributions , no normalization procedure is required for our explanatory factors . Ultimately , we decided to carry out both models as a robustness check for our analysis , relying on a 95 % level of signiﬁcance to test the signiﬁcance of each variable and thus accept or reject the hypotheses . Furthermore , we represent our categorical variables ( i . e . cognitive and location category ) with the gen - erated dummy variables , excluding the dummy representing the last level for it to be considered as the reference category , as suggested by Le Cessie and Van Houwelingen ( 1991 ) . To start with , we need to account for the non - independence between individual dyads , since we are pairing up the CC authors multiple times with diﬀerent REF authors . To this purpose , we enable the following option : vce ( cluster clustvar ) , which indicates the regression to allow for intra - group correlation . This command relaxes the usual requirement for the observations to be independent from each other so we can obtain correct standard errors ( Baldi , 1998 ) ; clustvar speciﬁes the association for each observation , in our case , the source node id identiﬁes pairs having the same CC author . Interaction terms Given that the impact of spatial distance may be better comprehended in combination with other factors , as Morgan ( 2004 ) claims , we decide to check for interaction terms . Interestingly , the interaction between 78 Euclidean distance and shortest path yielded signiﬁcant behavior , so we shall include it in our model ; we also checked for combinations between cognitive and SNA metrics , with no veriﬁable eﬀect discovered . Goodness - Of - Fit ( GOF ) testing The GOF tests for the model , namely , the Hosmer - Lemeshow and R 2 tests , failed to reach signiﬁcance in our regressions . However , it has been previously suggested that these tests might not perform well every time ( as opposed to tests targeting linear models ) ( Le Cessie and Van Houwelingen , 1991 ; Hosmer et al . , 1997 ) . Accordingly , we presume that this issue might be caused by the large sample size we have . Moreover , the high number of observations increases the degrees of freedom used for the tests . Therefore , we decide to run an experiment with a smaller random sample . We discovered that for regressions using less than 1 , 000 observations ( we tested with a 1 % random sample of about 700 observations ) , the ﬁtting of our model was found to be signiﬁcant . With this in mind , we proceeded to run the experiment 10 times , each time with a diﬀerent 1 % random sample , as way of validating our assumption . Importantly , all the proximity variables remained signiﬁcant throughout each run , with the exception of coauthored works . In the majority of runs , the eﬀect of this control variable is omitted due to what is known as “separation or quasi - separation” ; also called perfect prediction , this condition refers to a scenario in which the response variable does not change by diﬀerent levels of the independent parameters ( Long and Freese , 2006 ) . In this case , having co - published at least one paper would ensure the existence of a citation link , which is the expected behavior for direct co - authors . Nevertheless , we observe that pairs with co - authored works have a very low incidence in our data ( only 1 , 798 pairs , that is , 2 . 26 % of the whole sample ) . At any rate , there is increasing consensus that GOF statistics need not always be presented for this type of regression analysis ( Menard , 2009 , p . 58 ) , due to their weaknesses ( Allison , 2013 ) . Controlling for co - publishing pairs We noticed in the ﬁrst regression run that we have a small number of completely determined successes . Given the condition of perfect prediction displayed by the coauthored works variable during the GOF experiment , we hypothesize that co - authoring academics will always cite each other , hence strongly aﬀecting the model . We inspected closely the data to see if all co - publishing pairs were indeed linked by an eﬀective citation , and found that out of the 1 , 798 direct co - author pairs , only three did not have a positive citing link . Since we are measuring the impact of the co - authorship network structure on citing behavior and not collaboration itself , we decide to account for this circumstance to better observe the inﬂuence of collaborative proximity on indirectly connected scientists in the network . The number of co - publishing pairs is low enough ( 2 . 26 % ) as to be deemed of no consequence , but we still control for it nonetheless . Therefore , we run the regressions excluding any pairs representing co - publishing scholars , i . e . links with 79 a value in the co - authored works control variable greater than 0 . Despite the three non - citing pairs with this condition , we only use non - directly connected pairs in the regression ( 73 , 949 ) , because there is a strong possibility that even if they did not cite in the period of this study , a citation between them is prone to occur later in time ( or perhaps it already occurred in the years prior to our analysis data ) . 3 . 4 . 4 Applying Classiﬁcation For this stage of our analysis , we ﬁrst need to identify which classiﬁer is the best ﬁt for our data set . We employ IBM SPSS Modeler version 17 . 1 and upload reﬁned data , with properly identiﬁed data formats and missing values . Note that from this point forward , the term node may include additional connotations besides referring to an author entity in the collaboration network ; in the terminology of the SPSS Modeler software , node instead refers to a particular functionality of the software , or a branching position within a decision tree . Validation Prior to getting started with classiﬁcation , we decided to implement validation techniques that would improve the predicting ability of models ( see Michie et al . , 1994 ; Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) . With this in mind , we adopt data partitioning and cross - validation . First , we include a Partition node , which randomly splits the data according to a speciﬁed percentage in training and test portions . Typically , about two - thirds of the data is reserved for training the classiﬁer model , while the remaining third is used for testing it . Even though not using the full sample to train the model might result in a slight loss of eﬃciency , this would not be a major issue when dealing with large data sets ( greater than 1000 ) ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) . In our case , we set the percentage to be 60 % for training data , which will help to construct the model . The remainder ( 40 % ) shall be used as testing partition , allowing us to see whether its classiﬁcation power is good enough to predict whether a citation occurs between two authors or not , based upon the predictor variables . Secondly , we employ 10 - fold cross - validation , meaning that the training data is ﬁrst divided into 10 subsets and then 10 models are trained . Each sub - model using a diﬀerent subset of the data as the test partition to determine how well the model performs on new data . Once all 10 models are built , they are combined in an ensemble by taking their mean accuracy for scoring . Lastly , some models ( such as decision trees ) have settings for overﬁtting prevention , which were enabled for our processing . 80 Choosing applicable models SPSS Modeler provides a procedure called Auto Classiﬁer node , which executes several algorithms in a single modeling run to ﬁnd which are best ﬁtted to successfully predict the outcome variable . Due to the binary nature of our target value , only certain models in SPSS Modeler are shown as applicable for this classifying task . We next discuss the evaluation metrics used to appraise the results of prediction models . Evaluating classiﬁers There are several measures used to evaluate the performance of a prediction model for binary classiﬁcation throughout the literature ( see Getoor , 2005 ; Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ; Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ; Dong et al . , 2015 ) . First and foremost , the Confusion Matrix ( also , classiﬁcation or error matrix ) summarizes the rela - tionship between the two sources of information : actual data vs model predictions . The correct predictions , as shown in Table 8 , are located on the diagonal . Predicted Negative Positive Actual Negative TN FP Positive FN TP Table 8 : Confusion Matrix Considering a positive prediction as being identiﬁed , and a negative one as being rejected , we have : TP = True Positive = correctly identiﬁed FP = False Positive = incorrectly identiﬁed ( Type I error ) TN = True Negative = correctly rejected FN = False Negative = incorrectly rejected ( Type II error ) From its results , various metrics can be calculated , in particular : (cid:2) Overall Accuracy ( AC ) is the total of correct predictions divided by the total number of cases . (cid:2) Recall Also known as the true positive rate or sensitivity , recall is the proportion of positive cases that were correctly identiﬁed , that is , TP divided by FN + TP . (cid:2) Speciﬁcity Also called the true negative rate , speciﬁcity measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identiﬁed as such , that is , TN divided by TN + FP . (cid:2) Precision ( P ) is the proportion of the predicted positive cases that were correct , that is , TP divided by TP + FP . 81 (cid:2) F1 - score Also F1 - measure , it combines precision and the recall in a single score . It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall : F 1 = 2 · precision · recall precision + recall (cid:2) Out - of - bag ( OOB ) error Term used exclusively for Random Forest , it constitutes the overall misclassiﬁcation error calculated by each tree formed . (cid:2) ROC area is another common metric to examine the decision - making ability of classiﬁers , which relies instead upon the Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve ( also known as area under the ROC curve ) . A ROC graph is a plot with the FP rate on the X axis and the TP rate on the Y axis . The top left corner is the optimal location on an ROC graph . The further the curve lies above the reference line , the more accurate the test , indicating a high TP rate and a low FP rate . Particularly , we shall make emphasis on accuracy , precision , recall , and the F1 - score , as well as in ROC area , considered as standard practice in Machine Learning to assess classiﬁers ( following Getoor , 2005 ; Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) . Selecting Predictors Most importantly for our work , we need to identify which independent parameters are the best predictors among the variable set . Depending on the model , feature importance is ranked according to each algorithm’s choice ( Michie et al . , 1994 ) for determining which features have more weight on the outcome . For instance , the C5 . 0 classiﬁer uses the maximum information gain ratio ( IGR ) to select the best attributes ( as does Dong et al . , 2015 ) . In SPSS Modeler , this ranking can be visualized on the predictor importance plot generated by each model .

FieldsUsed Area Under Curve Figure 20 : Best - performing models , as ranked by SPSS Modeler In the case of a Random Forest classiﬁer , there are two types of variable importance measures : 82 (cid:2) Mean Decrease Accuracy ( MDA ) , also known as permutation accuracy importance . This rate is determined during the OOB error calculation phase . The more the accuracy of the random forest decreases due to the exclusion ( or permutation ) of a single variable , the more important that variable is deemed . Put simply , the greater the drop in prediction capability , the more signiﬁcant the variable . This metric is particularly helpful for variable selection . (cid:2) Mean Decrease Gini ( MDG ) . The Gini importance describes the improvement in the Gini gain splitting criterion . The Gini index ( a measure of node impurity ) describes the overall explanatory power of the variables . The mean decrease in Gini coeﬃcient is a measure of how each variable contributes to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves in the resulting RF . Each time a particular variable is used to split a node , the Gini coeﬃcient for the child nodes is calculated and compared to that of the original node . The changes in Gini are summed for each variable and normalized at the end of the calculation . Variables that result in nodes with higher purity have a higher decrease in Gini coeﬃcient . Simply , the Gini metric gives information about the explanatory relationship between the variables selected . In other words , predictors with high Gini values are more likely to split a branch into “pure” classes . Finally , we shall use these measurements to determine which variables are the best contributors to the prediction task . Classifying with Decision Trees From the 12 diﬀerent models we set the program to test our sample data in , Figure 20 depicts the best - performing ones from the ranking of the model comparison . As a preliminary rule to pick models , we consider the overall accuracy , which refers to the percentage of observations correctly predicted by the model vs the total . It is noteworthy to mention that the models were evaluated by their performance on the testing partition . Importantly , due to the sensitivity to correlation , we ran the models using one set of uncorrelated vari - ables from the ones used with binary regressions : eigenvector as centrality metric , and Euclidean distance for geography measurement . In our case , decision tree algorithms turned out to be the best applicable models , outperforming other popular classiﬁers , like logistic regression , support vector machines , and linear discriminant analysis . Hence , we analyze the ones that did a better job at the classiﬁcation problem , namely , CART tree , C5 . 0 , and CHAID . The ﬁnal modeling structure built is depicted in Figure 21 . Given the traditional concerns perceived in decision tree - based models , we applied , to the best of our knowledge , ﬁne - tuning and validation techniques to prevent any bias and overﬁtting . Nevertheless , we follow the proposal by Sarig¨ol et al . ( 2014 ) and use a baseline predictor , and then proceed with what the literature considers to be a superior classiﬁer : Random Forest ( RF ) . 83 Citing Filter CART Tree Citing LRC Citing CHAID Tree Partition Citing Paired _ links Type Auto Classifier C5 Tree Citing Analysis Figure 21 : Modeling stream with SPSS Modeler Classifying with Random Forest As previously stated , Random Forest generates an ensemble of trees as their classiﬁcation mechanism . Since this model is not available by default on SPSS Modeler , we employ the RandomForest library ( Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ) in R . First , we calibrated the model settings , i . e . , the number of trees to build the model with , and the number of variables to be selected per tree ( mtry value ) . During the setup phase , we discovered that the algorithm has improved prediction performance ( better accuracy and reduced OOB error ) when using 600 trees with 6 variables per tree . Thus , we tested how the classiﬁcation power varies between 100 and 600 trees . In addition , we enabled the option to omit missing values from the process , while also controlling for co - publishing dyads as in the regressions . Given the robustness against correlation within the feature framework ( Breiman , 2001 ; Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ) , we decided to run the model using all the independent variables . Subsequently , we ran the RF with only 6 variables , the same ones used for regression and tree modeling , with the goal of ﬁnding out if the model is greatly aﬀected by removing correlated predictors . For the reduced model , we set 3 variables to be used per tree ( mtry value ) , also running the algorithm ﬁrst for 100 and then 600 trees . 84 CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion 4 . 1 Results In this section , we analyze the ﬁndings obtained from the two methods applied to predict the establishment of a citation link . 4 . 1 . 1 Regression Models Two diﬀerent regression models , logistic ( logit ) and probit , were run with varying factors accounting for the scientiﬁc domain , geography , and network centrality , as well as the spatial - social interaction , to check for statistical dependency between citing behavior and our set of explanatory variables . In total , we ran each model in 18 alternative variable combinations : 3 centralities x 3 geographic metrics x 2 interaction eﬀects ( with / without ) . Variable behavior was highly similar throughout each run ; we summarize the results for all 36 iterations ( see Table 9 ) by taking the average coeﬃcients , z - score , and robust standard error for each parameter . Remarkably , even after controlling for any co - publishing eﬀect , all variables in the model were found to be statistically signiﬁcant at a 95 % conﬁdence level , with associated p - values of less than 0 . 05 . The sole exception to this was the interaction term , whose importance dramatically decreased when the location category was used instead of a continuous metric . Even if one could argue that signiﬁcance was reached due to the large number of observations , the high z - score values would indicate otherwise ( see Singh , 2005 ) , thus conﬁrming the eﬀectiveness of our predictor 85 variables . In addition , we see that when actual non - signiﬁcant parameters are included ( as is the case of the interaction term ) , the model does manifest their low contribution . Regression performance Moreover , our regression modeling was able to correctly classify 76 . 20 % of the cases ( average accuracy of all runs ) , as depicted in Table 10 . Note that all predictions were calculated using 50 % as a cutoﬀ point for positive predictions . In addition to having an AUC ( Area under the ROC curve ) of 81 . 69 % , we can say that the proximity factors gave the regression rather good performance . Variable contribution We ranked the predictors with the z - statistic ( also z - score or Wald test ) as a measure of their association with the response variable ( Thompson , 2009 ) ; also , because this metric does not depend on the unit of measure of the parameters , as standardized coeﬃcients do in logistic and probit regression models . Note that , since some factors had negative eﬀects ( traveling time , Euclidean distance , shortest path , and clustering coeﬃcient ) , we used the z - score’s absolute value . 0 5 10 15 20 25 Same state Same continent Same country Same city Degree Euclidean distance Traveling time Betweenness Clustering Coef Eigenvector Shortest path Interaction ED - SP Same ﬁeld Same subﬁeld 6 . 46 6 . 96 9 . 48 12 . 84 12 . 69 9 . 94 12 . 62 12 . 81 12 . 25 9 . 19 6 . 17 5 . 11 13 . 42 23 . 29 Figure 22 : Variable ranking by z - statistic in binary regressions Overall , cognitive proximity was the most inﬂuential factor in the regression , followed by collaboration , and the geographical aspect . 86 Summary of 36 combinations of logit and probit regression models Variable Regression models Signiﬁcant ?

Table 9 : Regression models summary 87 Cognitive Proximity We included the scientiﬁc domain eﬀect in the regression by using the two dummy variables ( cog1 and cog2 ) actually representing the scenario of two cognitively close scholars . The high z - scores the cognitive parameters displayed ( 23 . 29 and 13 . 43 respectively ) are an indication of their high contribution for establishing citation links . In fact , the magnitude of having the same subﬁeld was the greatest factor among the explanatory variables , almost doubling the increased probability from being from the same ﬁeld at every turn . Clearly , a Canadian author would be decidedly more likely to cite peers within the same cognitive subﬁeld or ﬁeld rather than outside of it . Geographical Proximity We successfully veriﬁed that all the representations of geographical proximity were signiﬁcant throughout the regression runs . Moreover , they had comparable contributions to explaining citing behavior , either as continuous or level - based metrics . In the categorical form of spatial distance , we observed that being in the same city / town ( loc1 ) is decisive when it comes to establishing a link between CC and REF scholars , closely followed by being in the same country ( loc3 ) , and to a lesser degree , being within the same continent ( loc4 ) . Remarkably , the co - location term that mattered the least was when authors are in the same state or province ( loc2 ) . In any case , all the location levels remained signiﬁcant even when the centrality metric varied . Altogether , we can say that our scale is a good portrayal of spatial closeness between scientists , since the average z - statistic of all four categories roughly equates the magnitude of Euclidean distance . Additionally , both Euclidean distance and traveling time presented a negative eﬀect on the outcome , meaning that they increase citation probability by decreasing in value . However , traveling time did seem to perform slightly better than Euclidean distance at every combination , which was a somewhat unexpected ﬁnding . This could be explained by our composition of the traveling time variable : we deﬁned that CC scholars located within 500 Km from a REF author would drive , otherwise electing to ﬂy ; and we also gave local ﬂights less extra time ( 3 hours ) than international ﬂights . We already observed that scholar pairs in the same city , i . e . mostly driving for a few minutes , have a high citing tendency ( loc1 ) . Yet , for greater distances , the construction of traveling time resulted in the leveling of domestic co - located academics : CC - REF pairs from the same province driving for a long time , have a comparable traveling duration to those in the same country , which would have short ﬂights , or at least , those in nearby regions in Canada . It follows that the traveling duration diﬀerences between intra - national distances were smoothed , thus falling into the same country ( loc3 ) category , which as we know , contributed signiﬁcantly to the model . Plus , since out - of - country 88 ﬂights were given 5 extra hours in addition to the ﬂying time itself , which caused a bigger duration gap between national vs internationally co - located dyads . Anyhow , the magnitudes of the Euclidean distance and traveling time eﬀects are close enough to assume that these variables can be used interchangeably . Regarding the behavior of the other independent variables while alternating the geography metrics , the sole diﬀerence we observed was that the interaction term became non - signiﬁcant when using location category , whereas for traveling time it was not aﬀected . This is reasonable , since traveling time acts as a close linear substitute to Euclidean distance , unlike location category , where the main eﬀect of a continuous distance measurement is no longer present . Collaborative Proximity First of all , we found signiﬁcance for all the collaborative metrics included . Of course , closeness centrality is the one exception to this rule since we decided to drop it altogether from the beginning , on account of its high correlation to other parameters like shortest path , besides the other centralities . At any rate , we could have a similar perspective of its behavior by means of applying degree centrality , given that they are closely related by deﬁnition . As with alternating spatial metrics , we noticed that the eﬀects from degree , betweenness , and eigenvector centrality remained similar , with degree having a marginally better presence in the model than the other two . We presume that this may be due to degree being a numeric variable composed only by integers , while the values of betweenness and eigenvector centrality are not only decimals , but also the diﬀerences in their distribution are very small - scale , which is also why their standard errors went up despite remaining signiﬁcant . Surprisingly , clustering coeﬃcient exhibited a negative eﬀect at every turn . Recall that high clustering coeﬃcient values refer to nodes at well - connected “neighborhoods” ; hence , its negative inﬂuence could pos - sibly meaning that REF authors located in the middle of collaborator cliques are not being as highly cited . Moreover , in the iterations with eigenvector centrality , the contribution of the clustering coeﬃcient aug - mented to some extent while the eigenvector variable itself reduced its eﬀect , as opposed to their magnitudes in the presence of degree and betweenness centralities ( where the z - score generally persisted ) . Eigenvector centrality being the metric that better reﬂects a scholar’s central position in regards to the whole network structure , this behavior is coherent with the variations in clustering coeﬃcient . In light of this , CC authors would have a citing preference towards REF nodes either with a high number of collaborators ( degree ) or strategically located as proxy nodes between diﬀerent clusters ( betweenness ) , but not necessarily embedded in the midst of a highly - cliquish collaborator neighborhood . Anyhow , in the interchanging runs , the centrality metrics’ z - statistic varied among a range of 9 - 15 ( absolute value ) , thus constituting themselves as primordial factors within the regression , right after the 89 inﬂuence of cognitive proximity . Furthermore , shortest path reﬂected a negative contribution , which implies that there is indeed a certain preference for citing REF nodes that are closer to the CC authors by acquaintanceship ; however , its eﬀect is not as high . Presumably , it is because we are facing a small - world network , with almost 95 % connected authors ( giant component ) , overall clustered at 75 % and with a mean of almost 4 hops between dyads . Therefore , the collaborator - chain factor , although important in the model , is not absolutely decisive to establish a citing link . Finally , the spatial - social interaction eﬀect created by combining Euclidean distance and shortest path was always found signiﬁcant , apart from when location category was used instead , as explained above . As a matter of fact , the interaction inﬂuenced its main variables whenever included , although leaving the other parameters unchanged : it magniﬁed the eﬀect of shortest path by 2 - 3 points of z - statistic , while reducing the score of Euclidean distance , and most noticeably , traveling time . Thus , we conﬁrm what we suspected about shortest path , in that it sometimes has the capacity to substitute for spatial proximity , with the latter serving as its proxy . Generally speaking , we conﬁrmed that the structure of the co - authorship network , as measured by various collaborative metrics , is meaningful to academic citation , coming next after cognitive proximity . At any rate , disregarding what the metric selected to represent centrality and geographic aspects was , cognitive proximity still was the most important factor . Nevertheless , we conclude that all of our explanatory variables ( in their main eﬀects ) kept their signiﬁcance throughout all the combination runs , proving their importance towards explaining citing behavior , as well as the robustness of the models . 4 . 1 . 2 Classiﬁcation Models Classiﬁcation performance Table 10 summarizes the performance metrics used to evaluate the resulting classiﬁcation per model ( calcu - lated on the testing partition ) . We added the regression models to this table , to have a better reference for comparison . Overall , in terms of precision , recall , and ROC area scores , the performance by all models was promising . The logistic regression achieved an F1 - score of 67 . 65 % and a 76 . 20 % overall accuracy , which is already good , since it means that citing links can be identiﬁed more often than not . Likewise , the decision - tree models had similar performance . Even though they did manage to increase the overall accuracy over the regression model , the improvement is not impressive , with a few percentage points in diﬀerence as compared to logistic and probit models . However , the predictive power was signiﬁcantly boosted by applying Random Forest algorithms ; this classiﬁer clearly outperformed the baseline models ( going from an F1 - Measure of 71 . 76 % of the best tree 90 Model Accuracy Precision Recall F1 - Measure ROC area Run time ( sec ) Logit / Probit 76 . 20 76 . 37 60 . 72 67 . 65 81 . 69 1 . 28 CHAID 77 . 26 67 . 58 74 . 94 71 . 07 83 . 1 2 CART 77 . 44 65 . 46 76 . 77 70 . 67 80 . 2 4 C5 . 0 78 . 55 66 . 06 78 . 55 71 . 76 83 . 2 8 RF red ( 100 ) 83 . 66 83 . 02 77 . 23 80 . 02 90 . 42 20 . 65 RF red ( 600 ) 83 . 67 83 . 15 77 . 09 80 90 . 54 125 . 55 RF ( 100 ) 86 . 73 85 . 6 82 . 56 84 . 05 93 37 . 35 RF ( 600 ) 86 . 91 85 . 95 82 . 63 84 . 26 93 . 19 215 . 37 Table 10 : Classiﬁer performance metrics ( in % ) performer to 84 . 26 % in the fully - featured run with 600 trees ) . Regarding RF , we performed consistency checks with varying tree settings , and its output contributed to the robustness of our results . Interestingly , even the reduced RF model with 100 trees managed to outperform the best model from the decision trees . This veriﬁed the expectation of the better classifying capabilities of this model . Ultimately , prediction accuracy was reached at the expense of increased complexity ( 100 - 600 trees would be extremely hard to inspect ) and the processing time , which had a dramatic raise from just a couple of seconds to almost 4 minutes . Finally , improved performance was already accomplished with a reduced RF containing only uncorrelated variables , and though the accuracy slightly decreased , it brings the beneﬁt of having a less complex model . We next take a look at the citing - link attributes used to achieve classiﬁcation accuracy . Ranking predictor importance As we can see , all tree models seemed to mostly agree on variable ranking , according to their respective predictor importance plot depicted in Figure 23 . Contrarily to the regression , the predictor importance plot does not provide a clear indication of a positive or negative behavior . Notably , while generally the cognitive factor is seen by both tree and regression models as the best contributor , the perception about shortest path and spatial distance ( Euclidean measurement ) varies . We focused on the importance deduction by the C5 . 0 model , as our top - performer tree . Its ranking was very similar to the regression one , with the exception that shortest path was given more weight in the classiﬁcation job than the other SNA metrics . Interestingly , we took a look at the CHAID model ( which has the peculiarity of treating missing values as special cases in its tree - formation mechanism ) , and discovered that a citing link rarely occurred whenever two scientist were unconnected in the network ( refer to Figure 24 ) . Further , we inspected the data closely for this behavior and discovered that positively - linked pairs with missing shortest path predominantly had 91 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 Euclidean Distance Cluster target Eigen target Shortest path Cognitive dist 0 . 39 % 4 . 15 % 11 . 36 % 38 . 23 % 45 . 47 % ( a ) CART tree 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 Euclidean Distance Cluster target Eigen target Shortest path Cognitive dist 1 . 37 % 9 . 72 % 6 . 63 % 44 . 1 % 38 . 17 % ( b ) CHAID tree 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 Euclidean Distance Cluster target Eigen target Shortest path Cognitive dist 5 . 81 % 10 . 93 % 11 . 09 % 25 . 08 % 39 . 09 % ( c ) C5 . 0 tree Figure 23 : Variable Importance , as ranked per classiﬁer tree a cited author having a high degree centrality .

As we can see in Figure 25a , the tree - ranking for the two most inﬂuential variables held for RF as well , conveying that the model would lose the most if either cognitive distance ( cog1 and cog2 ) or shortest path are dropped . Moreover , we see that as more trees are grown , the importance of shortest path becomes more evident for the classiﬁcation . In addition , the relevance of each centrality measure ( along with the control variable of published works ) 92 has nearly the same weight ; this was expected , considering their existing correlation , and the observed behavior during the regressions . Additionally , eigenvector and degree centrality contributed slightly better to the model than betweenness , while traveling time marginally outperformed Euclidean distance , same as in the regression . Contrarily , location category was given the lowest rating in RF ; however , we presume that it might be due to the spatial levels losing importance whenever a continuous metric of geography is present . Besides , each level only accounts for a portion of the citing behavior , and correspondingly to the regressions , it is the average eﬀect of all location categories which matches the presence of a continuous metric . loc _ 2 loc _ 1 loc _ 3 loc _ 4 Between _ target Close _ target Euclidean _ Distance Travel _ Time _ sec Cluster _ target Degree _ target Pub _ works _ target Eigen _ target cog _ 2 Shortest _ path cog _ 1 0 200 400 MeanDecreaseAccuracy loc _ 2 loc _ 3 loc _ 1 loc _ 4 cog _ 2 Cluster _ target Between _ target cog _ 1 Travel _ Time _ sec Euclidean _ Distance Degree _ target Pub _ works _ target Eigen _ target Close _ target Shortest _ path 0 1000 2000 MeanDecreaseGini ( a ) 600 trees loc _ 2 loc _ 1 loc _ 3 loc _ 4 Between _ target Close _ target Travel _ Time _ sec Euclidean _ Distance Degree _ target Pub _ works _ target Cluster _ target Eigen _ target Shortest _ path cog _ 2 cog _ 1 0 50 150 MeanDecreaseAccuracy loc _ 2 loc _ 3 loc _ 1 loc _ 4 cog _ 2 Cluster _ target Between _ target cog _ 1 Travel _ Time _ sec Euclidean _ Distance Degree _ target Pub _ works _ target Eigen _ target Shortest _ path Close _ target 0 1000 2000 MeanDecreaseGini ( b ) 100 trees Figure 25 : Variable importance according to Random Forest In the reduced model with only 6 uncorrelated variables ( see Figure 26 ) , we can observe that their importance ranking does not seem to vary much when compared to a fully - featured model .

Following the reduced RF , it would seem that once inside a split , the power to reach purity in classiﬁcation ( i . e . to know for sure whether a citation will occur or not ) relies majorly on eigenvector centrality , followed by geographical distance and clustering coeﬃcient . Overall , the importance categorization from RF would mostly conﬁrm the selection of independent vari - ables for our problem and their contribution to the citing behavior of CC authors . 4 . 1 . 3 Testing the hypotheses At last , we are able to assess our null hypotheses concerning the impact of proximity aspects on the probability of scholarly citation . First of all , we tested H 0 1 : Citation probability does not increase when a Canadian author is cognitively proximate to another author . This parameter , as represented by its two levels of same subﬁeld ( cog1 ) and same ﬁeld ( 2cog ) , was found statistically signiﬁcant in the logit and probit regression models . Moreover , it was proven to be the main contributor to the citation eﬀect by both statistical and machine learning approaches ; CC scholars will decisively cite REF authors publishing in the same subﬁeld as themselves , and will also have a preference towards those from their own ﬁeld , as opposed to academics publishing outside of it . Consequently , we reject H 0 1 and instead , we assert that cognitive proximity is in fact an inﬂuential factor for citing . Likewise , we had evidence to reject hypothesis H 0 2 : Citation probability does not increase when a Cana - dian author is geographically proximate to another author , on the grounds of the signiﬁcance of all the metrics representing spatial proximity . Not only , were Euclidean distance and traveling time important to increase citing likelihood , both as alternate stand - alone factors as well as a combined eﬀect with dyad collaborative distance , but they also proved to have predicting capability . Importantly , authors co - located within the same country ( loc3 ) and city ( loc1 ) are very likely to be linked by citation . Next , we examined the hypotheses concerning collaborative proximity and an academic’s position within the co - authorship network . With null hypothesis H 0 3a : The probability of a Canadian author citing another does not increase due to the referenced author’s position within the collaboration network , we attempted to verify whether or not the citation probability increased the more central a cited author was found to be . Essentially , clustering coeﬃcient along with the various centrality metrics ( applying them one at a time ) turned out to be signiﬁcant , which gave us suﬃcient evidence to reject H 0 3a , having also displayed prediction power for the establishment of a citation link . This ﬁnding would imply that Canadian scientists are more likely to cite a REF author that has a good position within the collaboration network , in terms of : having co - published papers with a high number of people ( degree ) , whether he is more central in the network as a whole ( eigenvector ) , if the scholar acts as a proxy for clusters within the network ( betweenness ) , and if the 94 author is situated outside of highly - cliquish neighborhoods ( clustering coeﬃcient ) . Lastly , due to the signiﬁcance accounted to shortest path , we rejected H 0 3b : The probability of a Canadian author citing another does not increase if they are closely connected to each other within the collaboration network , in preference of the alternate statement : The closer two scholars are located with respect to each other within the co - authorship network ( through the chain of co - authoring peers ) , the higher the probability is for a positive citing link between them . Furthermore , shortest path would interact with Euclidean distance to add up to the explanatory power of the model , while also using the latter as proxy to establish such acquaintanceship connections , and thus substitute for spatial closeness . Having collaborative closeness would thus greatly serve to anticipate a citation link between authors , with shortest path being among the best - performer variables in the citing prediction . In sum , we determined that , regardless of the method used , the dependent variable of citation probability is successfully predicted by the chosen explanatory parameters deriving from each proximity aspect we decided to inspect , hence proving our hypotheses about the impact of proximity on citing behavior . 4 . 2 Discussion of Results In this section we present the implications of our ﬁndings , with respect to our research questions and aforementioned works in the literature . We now present them in the order of their discovered relevance towards citation probability . Importance of cognitive proximity We asked ourselves if having two scholars in the same scientiﬁc domain would increment the probability for there to be a citation between them . From our ﬁndings , it is a clear consensus that coming from close cognitive bases makes authors more prone to be linked by citation , and thus we gave a positive answer to our question . In fact , with the ﬁrst place ranking by both regression and classiﬁcation , it is likely the factor that inﬂuences the most at the time of choosing who to cite from . Moreover , our results align with those by Ding ( 2011 ) , who indicated that productive authors prefer peers sharing their same research ﬁeld to both cite and coauthor with , by analyzing academic citations in the ﬁeld of information retrieval . In turn , we conﬁrmed that despite nanotechnology commonly being depicted as a highly multidisciplinary ﬁeld , cognitive similarity still matters . In fact , Schummer ( 2004 ) had previously stated that nanotechnology displays a merely average multidisciplinarity level in its scientiﬁc citation patterns , not diﬀering much from other scientiﬁc bases . We also compare the impact of the cognitive proximity category to ﬁndings from innovation literature , 95 where Hu and Jaﬀe ( 2003 ) similarly indicated that technological proximity is important for knowledge ﬂows , as evidenced by increasing patent counts . Likewise , Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg ( 1999 ) had claimed that technologically proximate inventors are preferred for citing , with Cunningham and Werker ( 2012 ) aﬃrming the same behavior for patenting ﬁrms . In sum , the fact that cognitive interests are important for citing behavior , be it academic or innovative , remains unchallenged . More speciﬁcally , nanoscience citation appears to follow the classic tendency regarding information exchange that collaboration partners also display ( Boschma and Frenken , 2010 ) : knowledge base weighs heavily on peer - referencing selection . However , previous research indicates that interdisciplinarity is primordial in the development of nan - otechnology ( Malsh , 1997 ) for contributing to the academic society in terms of integrating knowledge from assorted domains . Also , since articles with an interdisciplinary background are allegedly more successful due to having increased value for the scholarly community ( Katz and Martin , 1997 ) , interdisciplinarity is an important factor for knowledge production . Besides , high levels of it in research are closely related to inno - vation ( Weingart , 2000 ; Rafols et al . , 2010 ) , and , on a practical note , it has been brought up that programs funding nanoscale research usually take interdisciplinary approaches ( Schummer , 2004 ) . In short , Canadian nano - scientists would have to balance the need of being cognitively proximate , and try to aim for the “idealistic nano - visions” ( Rafols and Meyer , 2007 ) of producing more interdisciplinary knowledge , in light of its weighty beneﬁts for knowledge production and innovation . This could be achieved by seeking information from complementary cognitive domains , thus avoiding the potential issues coming from cognitive lock - in Boschma ( 2005 ) warns about . Importance of collaborative proximity For our next research question , we hypothesized about the eﬀect of collaboration links between authors on the chance of being cited , for which we employed additional metrics to the ones usually adopted in inductive network analysis . Typically , authors in the literature ﬁnd it suﬃcient to focus on the eﬀects of just one or two variables , like degree centrality ( e . g . Wang and Guan , 2011 ) and / or shortest path . Instead , we preferred to examine the impact of this proximity on citations by constructing a comprehensive framework which accounted for various collaborative metrics . While the literature seems to agree with our results in that having a high degree centrality is favorable for citation purposes ( either academic or innovative ) ( e . g . Wallace et al . , 2012 ; Eslami et al . , 2013 ) , there are wide discrepancies regarding the other parameters . In this regard , Liu et al . ( 2014 ) argued that while degree is the best - performing centrality metric , be - tweenness centrality only evidenced a mild eﬀect on scholarly citation . Similarly , further analyses suggested 96 that solely by combining academic and innovation networks of collaboration ( i . e . when scientiﬁc research translates into practical applications ) , is the power of betweenness centrality to control knowledge ﬂows revealed ( Eslami et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , in the study by Abbasi et al . ( 2011 ) , both betweenness and closeness centralities did not even reach statistical signiﬁcance and were thus discarded . As for eigenvector centrality , whereas Liu et al . ( 2014 ) deemed it as non - signiﬁcant , Abbasi et al . ( 2011 ) claimed that it had a negative eﬀect on scholarly citation . Contrarily , our results prove otherwise , with the exception of closeness centrality , which was dropped from our statistical modeling . In this respect , although not evidenced by regression , the performance of closeness centrality was granted a comparable importance to all other centrality metrics in the prediction RF models . As a matter of fact , the positional features of authors in the co - authorship network , as characterized by the three centrality parameters of degree , betweenness , and eigenvector , were not only fairly equal ( with eigenvector slightly less so ) to inﬂuence the probability of citation , they also had similar predicting capabil - ities . Indeed , a Nanotechnology research paper is more likely to be cited if its authors are better located in the collaboration network . Moreover , the behavior exhibited by the clustering coeﬃcient of individual scholars , a factor that has been largely disregarded in previous works , contradicted the claim that being located in highly - cliquish neighborhoods enhances the possibility to receive citations from peers Eslami et al . ( 2013 ) . Additionally , in spite of the signiﬁcance displayed by betweenness centrality in his study , Breschi and Lissoni ( 2003 ) argued that shortest path was a more critical factor for resulting in citations , at least for patent literature . This conclusion would go more in hand with the behavior of shortest path in our analysis of citing prediction by using machine learning algorithms , where geodesic distance outperformed centrality metrics in the classiﬁcation task . Yet , this is not a regular centrality metric , but rather a precise value for every pair of scientists , for which reason we formulated a separate hypothesis to test this aspect . At any rate , although the impact of shortest path was not the highest among the factors in the regres - sion , our results from the statistical analysis displayed strong support for the general agreement that citing likelihood decreases as shortest path increases ( Singh , 2005 ; Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . This tendency revealed in our analysis contrasts with Wallace et al . ( 2012 ) , who claimed that apart from direct self - citations , they did not ﬁnd a strong preference to cite authors close in the co - authorship network , referring to number of hops in the shortest path . In addition , we must mention that we found only one case attempting to examine the impact of proximity on citation by means of prediction models . Sarig¨ol et al . ( 2014 ) were able to predict citation success only with SNA metrics , achieving what they considered to be high precision ( 60 % accuracy ) . We suspect that 97 our prediction accuracy has been much improved ( with 76 . 5 % accuracy at minimum to 86 . 91 % maximum ) by the other proximities , particularly cognitive distance , which turned out to be the most inﬂuential one . Nevertheless , we partially agree with their ﬁndings , in that they determined the eﬀect of most centrality measures by themselves to be almost negligible , having in turn to employ combined eﬀects . Moreover , we presume that the diﬀerences may be because , in addition to their chosen statistical methodology , their focus is predicting citation success rather than the establishment of a single citing link , which , although related , is not quite the same . In our case , the fact that the Random Forest algorithm gave notable weight to the SNA metrics , along with their statistical signiﬁcance in the regressions , gives us evidence to claim collaboration is decisive when it comes to pick academic references . Particularly , the eﬀects of the centrality metrics along with clustering coeﬃcient show the inﬂuence of how central authors ( taking the whole co - authorship network into consideration ) are preferred for citing . Ultimately , we aﬃrm that collaborative proximity , as measured by co - authorship , is relevant to the practice of citation , revealing the impact of social structure on the diﬀusion of scientiﬁc knowledge . Importance of geographical proximity Finally , we examine the most controversial factor from our research questions : geographical proximity . It has been argued in the literature ( Bouba - Olga and Ferru , 2012 ) that geography only matters when innovation , a knowledge - intensive economic activity , is involved . Bouba - Olga and Ferru ( 2012 ) proceeded to support this claim by means of analyzing the science - industry collaboration network of patent literature , being the only one that ever attempted to account for the traveling aspect of the geographical proximity deﬁnition in Boschma’s ( 2005 ) proximity framework , besides spatial levels . In our work , we refute this claim , since each of our geographical metrics were found signiﬁcant by the regressions and deemed important by the classiﬁers , manifesting a valid statistical dependence between spatial considerations and citation probability . Thus , our work constitutes , to our knowledge , the ﬁrst one that addresses scholarly citation without any involvement from innovation literature or sources . Moreover , we remark on the uniqueness of having considered the impact of several measures of geograph - ical proximities on citation ( as opposed to one or two , which is the common case in the literature ) . We also highlight the novelty of our construction of the traveling time variable , which contemplated two diﬀerent means of transportation according to distance conditions , and which required a high - level of precision in its measurement . Fortunately , we could achieve this precision by means of the developed methods which allowed us to beneﬁt from Google Maps and its geographic services , also allowing us to gather the actual aﬃliation location of the authors , with the corresponding correct location categories . Anyhow , our ﬁndings do seem to agree with conclusions from patent analyses , which assessed diﬀerent 98 scales of location category and their inﬂuence to establish a citing link ( Breschi and Lissoni , 2003 ; Singh , 2005 ) , in that geography is not a suﬃcient condition for knowledge diﬀusion , usually requiring an interaction from other aspects , like collaborative or cognitive proximity , as well . Other studies manifest the same for collaboration intensity as represented by patent citation count and frequency , although only one level ( country ) was considered ( Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg , 1999 ; Hu and Jaﬀe , 2003 ) . Furthermore , we discovered that from various location categories , being co - located in the same country and city is more important for citing , which was a similar case ( only country was proven ) for patents from the US Sonn and Storper ( 2008 ) . Overall , all three of our spatial metrics revealed that they are not inconsequential for studying citing behavior in a scholarly domain . However , given their perceived importance per diﬀerent models , along with the valid interaction discovered with shortest path , we take a conservative approach towards the conclusions on its eﬀect . Essentially , it would be the combination between distance and other aspects that have a greater impact on citation probability . Accordingly , we align with empirical studies presented on innovation works , as well as with researchers in the conceptual proximity literature ( such as Feldman , 2002 ; Morgan , 2004 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) that remark on the importance of geographical distance as complementary for other factors . To support our ﬁnding about geographical proximity , we take a look at the citation network , as repre - sented by the precise locations 1 of positively linked scientists in Figure 27 . We employed SNA attributes as ﬁlters to better adjust the visualization , in our case , the greater the node’s in - degree ( meaning an author being highly cited by others ) , the bigger the node shape is , and the darker its color . We can see a high density of incoming citations in North America , all over Europe , and in Asia near China , while citations are sparser in other places . Thus , from the perspective of Canadian scientists , although spatial co - location may be important , it would not make much diﬀerence of where the cited author is located , as compared to the richness of source in terms of scientiﬁc ﬁeld . Lastly , despite Canada’s place among leading countries in nanotechnology , it would still be surpassed by conglomerate areas of knowledge with a major concentration in the ﬁeld , located in the US , Europe , and Asia . Moreover , cognitive proximity would overall be more inﬂuential than geography , at least for Canadian scientists dealing with nanoscience research . Thus , spatial distance would act more like an underlying framework for scientiﬁc collaboration and the expansion of knowledge , as it has the potential to boost the development of other , more inﬂuential , proximities . Furthermore , the spatial impact would be better evidenced in the interaction between scholarly produc - tivity and innovation ( Gittelman , 2007 ; Almazan et al . , 2007 ; Sonn and Storper , 2008 ) , rather than in the mechanics of academic knowledge alone . Nonetheless , it is important to keep in mind that , however high its 1 We used the GeoLayout plugin with Mercator projection in Gephi . The background map was manually added for approxi - mate visualization purposes . 99 interplay with other attributes may be , geographical distance , still remained a critical actor in the evolution of science . Figure 27 : Geo - layout of nodes with positive citing link Last but not least , many studies have been conducted with positive citation links , usually , in terms of citation counts , whereas we chose to use both negative and positive linkages , and more importantly , because having deﬁned our problem as a classiﬁcation task , we were able to employ a prediction approach as well . Thus , we remark on the use of machine learning models to study the behavior of the proximity factors and discovering how strong a predictor they can be for citation probability . Research combining citation analysis and machine learning usually comes from other knowledge bases , such as physics ( Lichtenwalter et al . , 2010 ) and computer science ( Bethard and Jurafsky , 2010 ; Dong et al . , 2015 ; Getoor , 2005 ) . Notably , we did not ﬁnd any of them aimed at academic papers on nanotechnology nor addressing any combined proximity concerns . For example , in the study by Ib´a˜nez et al . ( 2009 ) , tokens from abstract and keywords were used to predict future citation patterns in terms of current citations . In the reviewed literature , the closest examples we could ﬁnd was citing prediction ( in the ﬁeld of computer science ) on the basis of collaboration network through supervised learning ( Sarig¨ol et al . , 2014 ) and unsupervised learning ( Jawed et al . , 2015 ) . Likewise , Dong et al . ( 2015 ) also makes use of SNA metrics , by anticipating scientiﬁc impact in terms of the author’s degree within the co - authorship network . Generally , all similar works in the domain of nanotechnology scholarly data have been conducted with statistical - only approaches ( e . g . Cunningham and Werker , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ; Singh , 2005 ) , or with 100 distribution models comparison ( e . g . Onel et al . , 2011 ) . And so , we supplement to the know - how of scholarly citation analysis by using both approaches in our investigation : statistical approaches and machine learning . Admittedly , the most diﬃcult task was to determine precisely which among these contributors is the most important . Nevertheless , our goal was to identify if the factors have inﬂuence or not by taking a three - fold proximity perspective , rather than exacting which among them is the most important . Finally , it is satisfactory to become , to our knowledge , the ﬁrst analysis which examines the impact of three proximities : cognitive , geographical , and collaborative , on citations at the same time . Plus , we were able to conﬁrm , by means of statistical evidence along with machine learning , that certain hypotheses and patterns of proximity inﬂuence from innovative citation also hold for academic citation , a feat which had not been previously undertaken . 4 . 3 Limitations and Assumptions Throughout our research we were exposed to some limitations , the ﬁrst of which is related to the sample selection . We had to narrow down our analysis to a few years , and restrict the selected authors within the period to come up with a manageable sample size . Had we taken the entire population for our working time range , our sample would have been constituted by millions of pairs due to all the possible author combinations . Clearly , although we would have liked to extend the period , we did not have the computational resources required to handle the task , such as the gathering of collaboration metrics . In particular , given the depen - dency on third - party applications for the geographical measurements , working with a greater data set would have been exceedingly time - consuming . However , we question whether a bigger sample would have been altogether beneﬁcial given that the case still would be that of a highly imbalanced data set . And , as we had established , the chosen methodology does not hold well in such scenario . Moreover , we were able to overcome this potential issue by means of the sampling technique implemented . Regarding our statistical analysis , we based our statistical inferences on the applied regression model in spite of the poor performance on the Goodness - of - Fit tests . We presume that this limitation is due to the large number of observations included in our sample . In this respect , we expect that the experiment performed apropos helps elucidate this point , and provides good evidence for the validity of our conclusions . Concerning the collaboration aspect , our research is circumscribed within a 5 - year window , implying the very real possibility that two authors may have co - authored a paper outside this time range . As consequence , in our network they appear as disconnected , aﬀecting the SNA metrics and shortest path , likely leading to isolated clusters . Surely , extending the collaboration network by more years would derive in more relation - ships between the authors and a closer - node network . Anyway , the big majority of authors were found to be 101 part of the giant component of the network , so this limitation did not turn out to be highly detrimental to our work . In addition , there is a chance that successful scholars ( in terms of published articles ) may have stopped publishing in year one of our focus period , due to passing away or simply having retired , just to name a few possible reasons . In such respect , the high degree that would account for receiving citations from Canadian researchers would be missing , whereas if we considered previous years , such author would be more central . Be that as it may , our insights about the collaboration factor are based on a glance “as - is” , which certainly could be improved upon by using time - windows and / or analyzing more years . Another limitation was the lack of address information in the database for some scientists . This resulted in the weeding out of a portion of our observations , because otherwise not every case would have had the geographic attributes required for our analysis . We suspect that the referenced scientiﬁc databases do not include aﬃliation details for all the possible co - authors in an article . Hence , although the proportion of discarded pairs was low , we advise caution to this potential bias in the interpretation of our results related to spatial distance . For cognitive proximity , we encountered the constraint of counting with ﬁeld and subﬁeld information pertaining to the paper rather than speciﬁcally to the author . Neither did we have speciﬁcs about the scholar’s scientiﬁc ﬁeld of interest , nor the department within their respective institution ( which could have provided an inkling to their scientiﬁc specialty ) . Thus , we made the assumption that the ﬁelds and subﬁelds of an article apply to its writers . Regrettably , this would provide a somewhat limited and not entirely correct view on cognitive impact , particularly for papers resulting from a highly multidisciplinary collaboration team . Nevertheless , we consider it is still a good indication ( and the results support our reasoning ) for knowing the ﬁeld of interest the author is publishing in , which could bring them to cite published works coming from similar ﬁelds . Besides , it has been argued in the literature that the discipline aﬃliation of coauthors corresponds to the discipline of their knowledge contribution ( Rafols and Meyer , 2007 ; Schummer , 2004 , p . 438 ) , Additionally , we considered papers with at least one Canadian author , without accounting for the fact that although one of the authors may have a Canadian address , the research may have been majorly conducted elsewhere . This restriction would be better examined through co - authoring pairs rather than citation dyads . Finally , we followed the literature and restricted our study to the domain of nanotechnology . As con - sequence , any collateral eﬀects due to diﬀerent citation patterns from diﬀerent disciplines were dismissed , although at the expense of generalization . However , in this limitation , we also ﬁnd an opportunity for future research . 102 CHAPTER 5 Conclusions 5 . 1 Conclusions This thesis explores the network of nanotechnology scientists in Canada and examines the relationship with the scholars they reference in their publications . We posed the questions of whether they are more likely to cite authors who are close to them in terms of : ( a ) cognitive proximity , ( b ) geographical proximity , and ( c ) collaborative proximity . Our study concerned a quantitative research that implemented mixed methods to establish the validity of our claims , and so , we validated our ﬁndings by means of a traditional statistical approach as well as through the more contemporary methods of machine learning . Consequently , we found as answer to research question ( a ) that Canadian authors do show a statistical strong tendency to reference within their own knowledge base . Moreover , this seems to be the distinct most inﬂuential factor among those inspected . For research question ( b ) our results established that there is a signiﬁcant association between the spatial separation between scientists and whether they choose to cite or not . Yet , given the revealed interactions with other factors arising from the results , we take a moderate stance in the aﬃrmation that geography can single - handedly cause citations . Finally , regarding research question ( c ) according to the results , the analyzed co - authorship network proved that the collaborative aspect in regards to increasing citation probability is signiﬁcant . In addition , an author’s chances of getting cited would increase either by having a central position within the network , or by being connected through collaborating peers . 103 Our ﬁndings related to geographical proximity support previous works coming from innovative literature that shows spatial separation acts in hand with the other elements as a framework for knowledge diﬀusion . Moreover , we took a critical approach at what the implications of nanoscale researchers having a marked preference for citing within their own cognitive domain could be for their research and its contribution to science and technology . Furthermore , our ﬁndings in the collaboration aspect challenged the idea that social centrality metrics have no predicting power by themselves in regards to citation , proving otherwise . Besides , our results agreed with other authors in the canon about the signiﬁcance of being well - connected in the network . Our work contributes to the literature by being a relational way of analyzing distinct eﬀects on knowl - edge creation , as measured by citation . Speciﬁcally , it augments on the understanding of nanotechnology information ﬂow , given the few studies targeting this domain from a purely academic standpoint . Also , it adds to the scholarly community know - how by inspecting the predicting power of proximity factors and structural properties of the collaboration network on scientiﬁc knowledge output . Furthermore , these ﬁndings would constitute an attention call for the government and policy - makers , to ﬁnd ways to stimulate interdisciplinarity on nanoresearch . While existing policies may be beneﬁcial towards encouraging the international collaboration of scientiﬁc community , our results could be of interest to determine that much can be done to improve other aspects , such as the already important social impact . In conclusion , either by regression or classiﬁcation , we can explain and even predict the citation behavior of nanoscience researchers , by inspecting the factors of cognitive specialization , geography , and collaboration . We are thus satisﬁed after having been able to determine through a diversiﬁed methodology that these attributes indeed contribute greatly to knowledge diﬀusion in Canadian nanotechnology . 5 . 2 Future Work As a result of our study , further research might well be conducted on the suggested lines of investigation : Replicate the analysis for innovative citation . It would be interesting to examine whether our model holds for Canadian innovators as well and if the same factors have incidence on patent creation , and compare the results to see if any diﬀerence is found between both knowledge - generating sources . Another research avenue would be to combine patent and academic literature on nanoscience , to obtain better understanding of the eﬀects of networks and proximities on innovation and the development of technological advances . Expand the proximity framework to investigate more proximity types , such as organizational or social . We wonder , for example , about the importance of cultural ( such as ethnicity , see Agrawal et al . ( 2008 ) ) and language factors for forming scientiﬁc collaboration ties . Future work could inspect their interactions with our studied parameters , though some of them may be harder to quantify . 104 Moreover , composite metrics could be developed to measure collaboration proximity in terms of SNA cen - tralities , such as forming combinations among them , or with values from a directed citation network . In addition , the concept of cognitive proximity could be expanded to include specialization ( topic clusters ) , given the wide variety of applications nanotechnology has . We could thus ﬁnd by how much our model can improve its classiﬁcation power for predicting citations by including these or other aspects . Besides , the same aspects of cognitive domain and geography could be inspected within the collaboration network , to see if the same proximities inﬂuence whom scientists choose to coauthor with . Implement time - windows , and widen the temporal coverage of the collaboration network . By adding a time - based frame for anticipating citation links , we might identify trends and expose other complex behaviors in citing practices . Likewise , associating the social networks of collaboration and citation within time - frames might reveal practices that increase citation probability , such as authors preferring to cite authors they have cited before . Compare to other scientiﬁc databases to validate if our conclusions remain for other scholarly col - lections . Although Scopus has a wide coverage from journals across the globe , this would eliminate any potential bias caused by choosing literature published only in the English language . Examine the reverse citation eﬀect . Our ﬁndings reveal who it is that Canadian scientists are citing , based on their proximity and attributes of the reference author . But , it would also be interesting to study the opposite eﬀect , that is , who among the academic nanotechnology community is citing Canadian scholars and why . Examine other ﬁelds to see if our models are applicable for bodies of knowledge from other disciplines . We could learn if they adhere to the observed patterns or if they exhibit diﬀerent tendencies on the ranking of variable importance and their interactions . Finding aﬃnities in their behavior would enable us to make generalized conclusions about scientiﬁc citation . Additionally , it would provide valuable insights to determine how similar or dissimilar diverse areas of science can be from one another . For instance , which ﬁelds rely more heavily on geographical proximity , or which academic community has a greater dependency on their social peers . Along these lines , we set this thesis as groundwork opening up an ample research agenda that would con - tribute to better understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the academic community of nanotechnology , and potentially in others as well . 105 Bibliography Abbasi , A . , Altmann , J . , and Hwang , J .
