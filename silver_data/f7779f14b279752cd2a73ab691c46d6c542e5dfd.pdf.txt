The family of Rho GTPases , in - cluding RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 , play a central role in many cell biological processes that involve cytos - keletal changes and cell movement . Speci ﬁ cally for Rac1 , we have shown that excision of Rac1 using a Tie2 - Cre animal line results in embryonic lethality in midgestation ( embryonic day ( E ) 9 . 5 ) , with multiple vascular defects . However , Tie2 - Cre can be also expressed during vasculogenesis , prior to angiogenesis , and is active in some hematopoietic precursors that can affect vessel formation . To circumvent these limitations , we have now conditionally deleted Rac1 in a temporally controlled and endothelial - restricted fashion using Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 transgenic mice . In this highly controlled experimental in vivo system , we now show that Rac1 is required for embryonic vascular integrity and angiogenesis , and for the for - mation of super ﬁ cial and deep vascular networks in the post - natal developing retina , the latter involving a novel speci ﬁ c function for Rac1 in vertical blood vessel sprouting . Aligned with these ﬁ ndings , we show that RAC1 is spatially involved in endothelial cell migration , invasion , and radial sprouting activities in 3D collagen matrix in vitro models . Hence , Rac1 and its downstream molecules may represent potential anti - angiogeneic therapeutic targets for the treatment of many human diseases that involve aberrant neo - vascularization and blood vessel overgrowth . & 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc . 1 . Introduction The Rho family of small GTPases is a family of small G proteins involved in cell signaling ; which encompasses twenty family members within the Ras superfamily in mammals ( Ridley , 2006 ; Vega and Ridley , 2008 ) . The best - studied Rho family members are RhoA ( Ras homolog gene family , member A ) , Cdc42 ( cell division control protein 42 ) , and Rac1 ( Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ) . Activation of RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 induces the assembly of three different F - actin containing structures via spe - ci ﬁ c signaling pathways ( Scita et al . , 2000 ) . These Rho family members have been recognized as intracellular switches that transduce signals cycling between a GDP - bound inactive form and a GTP - bound active form ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ) . Multiple cell surface receptors and their ligands stimulate Rho GTPases to control key biological processes . For example , tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors , such as those for platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) ( Olsson et al . , 2006 ) , as well as G protein coupled receptors ( GPCR ) and their ligands , including sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) ( Spiegel and Milstien , 2003 ) , stromal - derived factor 1 ( SDF1 ) Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / developmentalbiology Developmental Biology http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . ydbio . 2016 . 02 . 005 0012 - 1606 / & 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc . n Correspondence to : Moores Cancer Center , University of California , San Diego , 3855 Health Sciences Drive # 0803 , La Jolla , California 92093 - 0803 , United States .

Developmental Biology 411 ( 2016 ) 183 – 194 and its chemokine ( C – X – C motif ) receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) ( Guo et al . , 2015 ) , and histamine ( Mikelis et al . , 2015 ) all converge to activate Rho GTPases to initiate intracellular signaling pathways . Rho GTPases are also controlled by several cell adhesion molecules including integrins , cadherins , and Ig superfamily members ( Bur - ridge and Wennerberg , 2004 ) . On the other hand , Rho GTPases affect multiple downstream targets , all of which regulate a variety of cell processes including cell proliferation , migration , cell cycle , and gene expression ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ; Vega and Ridley , 2008 ) . Rac1 is well recognized for its role of regulating actin polymerization and the induction of lamellipodia ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Rac1 has several downstream effectors , such as ni - cotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidases ( Hordijk , 2006 ) , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein family ver - prolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) ( Miki et al . , 1998 ) , and the p21 activating kinases ( PAKs ) ( Bosco et al . , 2009 ) , to name but a few . The formation of blood vessels during development involves two distinct process , vasculogenesis and angiogenesis , which ex - hibit a partial temporal overlap ( Jain , 2003 ; Patan , 2004 ) . Vascu - logenesis is the process by which a rudimentary network or plexus of blood vessels are formed from primitive progenitor cells known as angioblasts , whereas angiogenesis is the process through which new blood vessels form from the remodeling , growth , and sprouting of pre - existing vessels ( Jain , 2003 ) . Vasculogenesis oc - curs in the heart and also forms the ﬁ rst primitive embryonic vascular plexus in extraembryonic tissues , such as the yolk sac ( Patan , 2004 ) . Angiogenesis is a multistep process , which is tightly regulated by a balance between pro - and anti - angiogenic factors ( Simons , 2005 ) . In a prior study , our laboratory showed that en - dothelial - speci ﬁ c excision of Rac1 results in embryonic lethality in midgestation ( around embryonic day ( E ) 9 . 5 ) , and the defective development of major vessels and complete lack of small branched vessels ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . This study provided evidence that Rac1 in endothelial cells ( ECs ) is essential for vascular development ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . However , the study was conducted using a Tie2 - Cre driver line , which , in addition to ECs , is also expressed in a small fraction of hematopoietic precursor cells that differentiate into a various cell types , including monocytes / macrophages that play an important role in vessel formation ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , it re - mains possible that Tie2 expression in cells other than ECs may be responsible for the observed vessels defects . Additionally , because Tie2 is expressed early during development , previous observations could have been due to an undesirable compound impact in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis . To circumvent these limitations , we have now employed mice harboring a ﬂ oxed allele of Rac1 , which were crossed with Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 transgenic mouse line ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) that has endothelial - restricted expression during developmental angiogenesis and in adults . We focused our analysis on the embryo back skin and post - natal retina as suitable and highly de ﬁ ned models for studying angiogenesis , both under physiological and pathological conditions . Indeed , we now show that in this highly controlled experimental system , Rac1 plays a B A Cdh5 Endothelial - specific Rac1 - KO mice Tamoxifen Embryonic Rac1 excision CreERT2 Rac1 loxP loxP + Tamoxifen Post - natal Rac1 excision : Retina sample Harvest E0 . 5 1 . 5 2 . 5 10 . 5 11 . 5 14 . 5 9 . 5 12 . 5 13 . 5 15 . 5 Plugged loxP P0 1 2 3 Tamoxifen 6 8 10 Harvest tsevraH htriB Harvest Rac1 + / + Rac1 fl / + mT / mG Cdh5 ( PAC ) iCreERT2 C P8 Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 mT / mG t dTo m a t o / E G F P 200μm Fig . 1 .

Materials and methods Mice and Breeding – C57BL / 6J Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 mice ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) were bred into a same background of animals carrying a ﬂ oxed allele of Rac1 gene ( Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . Rac1 þ / þ 7 Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 and Rac1 ﬂ / þ 7 Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 mice were bred with mT / mG reporter mice ( Gt ( ROSA26 ) ACTB - tdTomato - EGFP ) obtained from the Jackson labora - tory to con ﬁ rm the ef ﬁ ciency of Cre activation in mice ECs . All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animals ( Scienti ﬁ c Procedures ) Act of 1986 under an ACUC approved ani - mal protocol . Mice were administered Tamoxifen ( 2 mg per adult mouse , 50 μ g per new born mouse ; Sigma ) by intraperitoneal in - jection at E10 . 5 , post - natal day ( P ) 1 , P2 and P3 , respectively . Em - bryos and retinas were collected at E15 . 5 , and P6 , P8 , and P10 , respectively . Schemes of the protocol for gene deletion are shown in Fig . 1A and B . Genotyping assay for Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ , Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 , and mT / mG mutants – To genotype for the Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ , Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 , and mT / mG , PCR was performed on mice genomic DNA extracts from ear or tail biopsies with the use of JumpStart REDTaq ReadyMix Reaction Mix ( Sigma - Aldrich , Catalog no .

The primary an - tibodies used were : anti - Endomucin ( EMCN ) antibody ( rat monoclonal , clone V . 7C7 , Santa Cruz , 1 : 500 ) , and anti - PECAM - 1 antibodies ( rat monoclonal , clone MEC13 . 3 , BD Biosciences , 1 : 300 , or Hamster monoclonal , clone 2H8 , Millipore , 1 : 500 ) to detect ECs ; anti - ERG antibody ( rabbit monoclonal , clone EPR3864 , Abcam , 1 : 500 ) to detect ECs nuclei ; anti - α SMA antibody ( mouse mono - clonal with Cy3 conjugation , clone 1A4 , Sigma , 1 : 500 ) to detect vascular smooth muscle cells ; anti - phospho - Histon H3 ( pSer28 , rat monoclonal antibody , clone HTA28 , Sigma , 1 : 1000 ) to detect proliferating cells . The samples were then washed 3 times in 0 . 2 % TX - 100 and 2 % goat serum in PBS for 10 min each at room tem - perature . The samples were incubated with blocking buffer con - taining secondary antibodies for 5 h at 4 ° C . Different combina - tions of Alexa Fluor - 488 - , Alexa Fluor - 568 - , Cy3 - or Alexa Fluor - 647 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson Immunoreserch , 1 : 500 ) were used for different staining . The stained skins and re - tinas were mounted on slides in an anti - fade mounting media ( Prolong Gold , life technologies ) . Samples were photographed by a Leica TCS SP5 confocal ( Leica ) or an Axio Imager Z1 microscope equipped with ApoTome system ( Carl Zeiss ) . The vascular area density and number of branching points were analyzed by An - gioTool ( Zudaire et al . , 2011 ) . The number of tip cells were counted in ten ﬁ elds per each condition . Z - stacks were analyzed in ZEN software ( Carl Zeiss ) in order to perform cut - view analysis . A cut - view is a software - generated reconstruction of the x – z planes of the z - stack , allowing visualization through the depth of the ac - quired z - stack . EC culture – Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) were cultured in EGM - 2 media with SingleQuots kit ( Lonza ) . All cells were cultured at 37 ° C in 5 % CO 2 and used from passages 3 – 6 .

S1P ( catalog no . BML - SL140 - 0001 ) is from Enzo Life Science . siRNA transfection – Ambion Silencer Select Validated small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , targeting RAC1 ( Life Technologies , siRNA ID : s11713 ) were purchased and re - suspended in H 2 O at a con - centration of 50 μ M . Lipofectamine 3000 ( Life Technologies ) was used as the transfection reagent . A double transfection protocol was used with Lipofectamine 3000 and with a ﬁ nal concentration of 10 or 50 nM siRNA added per transfection . AllStars Negative siRNA AF488 ( QIAGEN , Catalog no . 1027284 ) was used as a nega - tive control siRNA . Immunoblot analysis – HUVECs were lysed in RIPA buffer ( Atto , Catalog no . WSE - 7420 ) and concentration was determined using Bio - Rad DC protein assay . 20 μ g total protein was separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane overnight at 4 ° C . Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5 % milk in TBST and then incubated overnight at 4 ° C with primary anti - bodies : RAC1 ( BD Biosciences , Catalog no . 610650 , 1 : 1000 ) , GAPDH ( Cell Signaling Technology , Catalog no . 2118 , 1 : 2000 ) . Membranes were washed three times in TBS þ 1 % Tween - 20 ( TBST ) , probed with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) conjugated secondary anti - bodies for 1 h at room temperature in 5 % milk , washed three times in TBST , and detected using the Immobilon Western Chemilumi - nescent HRP substrate ( Millipore ) . The expression levels of the gene were evaluated by ImageJ software ( ver . 1 . 44 ; http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . In vitro cell proliferation assay – HUVECs were transfected with siRNA and plated in 96 - well plates ( Corning ) at 3 (cid:2) 10 3 cells per well . At 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h , cell proliferation was determined using the alamarBlue cell viability reagent ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ' s recommended protocol . In vitro cell migration assay – Migration assays were performed using a 24 - well Boyden chamber with an 8 - μ m pore size poly - carbonate membrane ( Corning ) coated with ﬁ bronectin ( Life Technologies , Catalog no . 33016 - 015 ) . HUVECs transfected with siRNA were added to the upper chamber at 2 (cid:2) 10 5 cells per chamber , and chemo - attractant ( S1P 100 nM or VEGF 100 ng / mL ) was added to the lower chamber in serum - free EGM - 2 media . After incubation for 24 h at 37 ° C , the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were gently removed , and the cells on the lower surface were ﬁ xed and stained with Differential Quik Stain Kit ( Polysciences ) . Images of the entire lower surface of the mem - branes were taken , and the number of migrated cells was counted ( four wells per condition ) . In vitro three - dimensional collagen matrix invasion and sprout assays – For three - dimensional ( 3D ) observation angiogenesis in vitro , we performed invasion and sprout assay as described pre - viously ( Koh et al . , 2008 ; Uchida et al . , 2015 ) . In invasion assay , 2 . 5 mg / mL collagen type I ( BD Bioscience ) gels were prepared , including SCF , SDF1 , and IL - 3 in the gel at 200 ng / mL with S1P 100 nM or VEGF 100 ng / mL , and were seeded with HUVECs on the surface at a density of 4 (cid:2) 10 4 cells / well . Culture media included FGF and IGF - II . After incubation for 24 h at 37 ° C , assays were ﬁ xed in 3 % glutaraldehyde , and processed for future analysis . Cells were stained with 1 % toluidine blue in 30 % methanol to increase vi - sualization before imaging . Data analysis was done by imaging the HUVECs invasive front at 3 depths below the monolayer of cells N . Nohata et al . / Developmental Biology 411 ( 2016 ) 183 – 194 185 ( 50 m m apart in depth ) . Images were obtained and the number of HUVECs present at each depth counted ; the counts at the 3 depths were added together to give a total number of invading cells per well . In sprout assay , to make aggregates of HUVECs , 2 (cid:2) 10 3 cells were cultured in each well of ultra - low attachment round bottom 96 - well plate ( Corning ) overnight , then the cell aggregates were transferred into collagen gels . After collagen solidi ﬁ ed , the cell aggregates were cultured with EBM - 2 medium with SingleQuots kit for 24 h . The aggregates were ﬁ xed by 4 % PFA and stained with Alexa Fluor - 568 - conjugated Phalloidin ( Life Technologies , 1 : 500 ) to detect actin cytoskeleton and TO - PRO - 3 ( Life Technologies , 1 : 3000 ) to detect nuclei . Confocal microscopy was carried out on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal ( Leica ) . Statistical analysis – All of the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results . Statistical analysis of vas - cular networks , cell proliferation assay , cell migration assay , and 3D angiogenesis analysis was performed by unpaired two - tailed Student ' s t test using JMP ( version 12 . 0 , SAS Institute ) .

Results To investigate the role of endothelial Rac1 in vivo , mice carrying a ﬂ oxed allele of Rac1 were bred with mice carrying tamoxifen - inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the Cdh5 promoter ( Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 ) ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The harvest schedules for embryo and post - natal retina are depicted in Fig . 1B . Following tamoxifen administration , ef ﬁ cient Cre - recombinase activity was con ﬁ rmed using Rac1 þ / þ / mT / mG 7 Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 and Rac1 ﬂ / þ / mT / mG 7 Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 . EGFP was strongly and EC - speci ﬁ cally expressed only in the retinas with Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 line ( Fig . 1C ) . We collected the embryo back skin at E15 . 5 to observe the ef - fect of EC - speci ﬁ c Rac1 excision on embryonic angiogenesis , and avoided the effect of Rac1 excision during vasculogenesis by ad - ministrating tamoxifen at E10 . 5 since the formation of major vessels are already completed by around E9 . 5 ( Coultas et al . , 2005 ) . Homozygous deletion of endothelial Rac1 ( Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ / Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 ; henceforth referred to as Rac1 - eKO ) resulted in re - markable hemorrhage at E15 . 5 ( Fig . 2A ) .

Surprisingly , there was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the length of radial expansion of the retinal plexus at P6 ( Fig . 3A and B ) , suggesting that Rac1 is dispensable for this process , or that Rac1 gene deletion may not result in a critical reduction of Rac1 protein levels until later stages of angiogenesis . Aligned with the second possibility , a signi ﬁ cant delay of blood vessel expansion was noted in the retina of Rac1 - eKO at P8 ( Fig . 3C and D ) . Fur - thermore , deletion of endothelial Rac1 resulted in signi ﬁ cant re - duction of vascular area and the number of branching points in post - natal retina at P8 ( Fig . 3E and F ) . Around P6 – P8 , while the super ﬁ cial plexus expands radially , it also starts remodeling rapidly , generating vertical sprouts to form a deep plexus concomitantly . We found that there was an abnor - mal morphological change at the angiogenic front of P8 retina in Rac1 - eKO ( Fig . 3A ) . Normal sprouting structure was shown in control ( Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) ( Fig . 4A , lower left ) , whereas ECs were abnor - mally aggregated at the angiogenic front in Rac1 - eKO ( Fig . 4A , lower right ) rather than forming vessel sprouts . Indeed , the number of tip cells was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in Rac1 - eKO ( Fig . 4B ) . We compared the proliferative activity of ECs at the angiogenic front between control ( Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) and Rac1 - eKO using phospho - Histone H3 ( pHH3 ) staining ( Fig . 4C ) . We counted and calculated the ratio of pHH3 and ERG ( as an EC nuclear marker ) double po - sitive cells per total ERG positive cells . There was a signi ﬁ cant increase of the pHH3 and ERG double positive cells in Rac1 - eKO ( Fig . 4D ) , suggesting that vessels that cannot sprout normally in response to angiogenic cues instead remain as a disorganized hyperproliferative mass . We also examined vertical sprouting ac - tivity at P8 using Z - stack mode . Vertical sprouting vessels , which develop from surface plexus to form a deep plexus ( approximately 20 m m in depth ) are shown in Z - stack mode ( Fig . 4E , upper ) . Counting the number of sprouting vessel spots at 15 m m depth in control ( Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) versus Rac1 - eKO ( Fig . 4E , lower ) , we note a sig - ni ﬁ cant and remarkable decrease of vertical sprouts in Rac1 - eKO ( Fig . 4F ) . Around P10 – P12 , the deep plexus layer reaches the edge of peripheral retina . We found that the extension of the super ﬁ cial vascular network was completed in both control ( Rac1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) and Rac1 - eKO at P10 ( Fig . 5A ) , suggesting that compensatory me - chanisms may overcome Rac1 de ﬁ ciency as retinal blood vessel development progresses . However , the formation of the deep plexus network was still signi ﬁ cantly delayed in Rac1 - eKO ( Fig . 5B ) . Deletion of endothelial Rac1 resulted in signi ﬁ cant re - duction of vascular area and number of branching points in the deep plexus networks at P10 ( Fig . 5C ) . As vertical sprouting involves a complex process in which ECs need to invade the avascular extracellular matrix under not fully understood guidance cues , we explored whether RAC1 inhibition controls EC invasion of matrices in a more de ﬁ ned conditions . For these studies , we conducted in vitro experiments using HUVECs with negative control siRNA ( si - Control ) and siRNA for RAC1 ( si - RAC1 ) . si - RAC1 10 nM suppressed (cid:3) 75 . 5 % of Rac1 expression compared to si - Control . Moreover , si - RAC1 50 nM suppressed (cid:3) 92 . 8 % of RAC1 expression when compared to si - Control ( Fig . 6A ) . To ensure maximal protein suppression , all following functional experiments were performed with si - RAC1 50 nM . Cell prolifera - tion activity was measured by alamarBlue assay at 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h , respectively . Knockdown of RAC1 in HUVEC revealed that EC proliferation was signi ﬁ cantly suppressed in response to stimula - tion with both S1P and VEGF ( Fig . 6B ) .

These ﬁ ndings align with a role for RAC1 as part of the proliferative signaling response initiated from VEGF and S1P receptors . We then investigated cell invasion activity using quantitative collagen type I gel 3D invasion assays ( Koh et al . , 2008 ) . Knockdown of RAC1 in HUVECs revealed that EC invasion activities were nearly completely suppressed ( Fig . 7A ) . Finally , in cell sprouting assays in collagen type I gels ( Uchida et al . , 2015 ) , knockdown of RAC1 in HUVECs revealed that EC sprouting activities were signi ﬁ cantly suppressed ( Fig . 7B ) . 4 . Discussion Vasculogenesis , the process by which blood vessels are formed de novo , versus angiogenesis , the process through which new blood vessels form from pre - existing vessels ( Jain , 2003 ) , could have distinct regulatory process and can be studied separately through carefully timed gene deletion experiments . In this study , we used embryo samples treated at E10 . 5 with tamoxifen to by - pass the vasculogenesis process , and analyzed the overall impact of Rac1 deletion on embryonic angiogenesis using back skin vessel development as a de ﬁ ned biologically relevant system . We also studied post - natal retinal blood vessel development in the Cdh5 ( PAC ) - iCreERT2 Rac1 f / f line , as it provided a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of Rac1 excision in a well - documented process of developmental angiogenesis after birth . In this regard , we were now able to explore the role of Rac1 in an endothelial - speci ﬁ c and angiogenesis - speci ﬁ c manner . Immunostaining of embryo back skin provides a quite useful method for the mor - phological and quantitative evaluation of embryonic blood and lymphatic vessels during development ( James et al . , 2013 ; Uchida et al . , 2015 ) . Rac1 excision in the embryo at E10 . 5 resulted in se - vere hemorrhage at E15 . 5 , which is likely due to an overall impact of Rac1 in vascular integrity and a malfunction in embryonic an - giogenesis .

Nohata et al . / Developmental Biology 411 ( 2016 ) 183 – 194 191 formation in the back skin was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in Rac1 de - ﬁ cient embryos , speci ﬁ cally in terms of the vascular coverage of the skin and its complexity , as judged by a decreased number of branching points . Overall , these data further support a central role of Rac1 in developmental angiogenesis . Multiple possibilities may account for the defective vascular integrity and hemorrhages caused by Rac1 de ﬁ ciency during em - bryo development . For example , previous studies by our team and others have demonstrated that Rac1 activity is necessary to sta - bilize the cell - cell junction between ECs via VE - cadherin ( Da - neshjou et al . , 2015 ; Timmerman et al . , 2015 ) , while VEGF - and S1P - induced vascular leakage is blocked by Rac1 de ﬁ ciency ( Ga - vard and Gutkind , 2006 ; Tan et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , the coordinated activation and inactivation of Rac1 as the vessels grow may be required to maintain the proper barrier function during develop - ment , and its de ﬁ ciency may result in defective EC – EC cell junc - tions and vascular leakage and hemorrhages . Alternatively , Rac1 may play a role in the stabilization of junctions between ECs and mural cells , whose de ﬁ ciency may impair mural cell recruitment causing vascular regression during development . Further work may be required to clarify the precise mechanisms involved in the complex phenotype observed as a consequence of Rac1 gene de - letion in the developing vasculature . The mouse retina is a widely - accepted model for detailed analysis of developmental angiogenesis after birth ( Stahl et al . , 2010 ) . The initial features of the retinal vasculature are practically planar , yet hierarchical , and stereotypical ( Milde et al . , 2013 ) . In mice , development of the intra - retinal vasculature starts after birth in a tightly regulated temporal and spatial manner , which enables this process to be readily observed and be manipulated experimentally ( Dorrell and Friedlander , 2006 ) . In C57BL / 6 mice , the super ﬁ cial vessels plexus forms during the ﬁ rst week after birth by radial expansion from the optic nerve into the periphery , reaching the edge at approximately P8 . We observed a signi ﬁ cant delay of blood vessel expansion in the retina of Rac1 - eKO at P8 , and abnormal vessel morphology , reduction of the number of tip cells , and hyperproliferation at the angiogenic front . Indeed , both in vitro HUVEC sprouting assays and in vivo retinal vasculature analysis demonstrated that Rac1 is required for endothelial sprouting . We noted , however , that there was a discrepancy in cell proliferation activity upon Rac1 de ﬁ ciency between the retinal angiogenic front and the in vitro experiments . These differences could be explained by an increase in compensatory pro - angiogenic mechanisms in vivo as a consequence of an initial defect in vessel function and the establishment of hypoxic conditions , similar to that driving oxygen - induced retinopathy ( OIR ) in mouse models ( Grossniklaus et al . , 2010 ; Penn et al . , 1994 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , VEGF and S1P levels are upregulated by hypoxia in a number of cell types including ECs ( Jung et al . , 2012 ; Schwalm et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , one possibility that may explain our ﬁ ndings is that the de ﬁ cient en - dothelial sprouting caused by Rac1 excision may promote the ex - pression and release of hypoxia - induced angiogenic factors , such as VEGF and S1P , by ECs in the developing ocular tissues . This may cause secondary EC hyperproliferation , which in turn may cir - cumvent Rac1 de ﬁ ciency by over activating other Rho GTPases or alternative compensatory pathways . This possibility is aligned with the fact that by P10 the retinal angiogenesis in Rac1 - eKO is normalized resembling that of the controls . Overall , reduced vas - cular network complexity in the developing skin and retinal vas - culature may be due to a combination of reduced endothelial sprouting and proliferation , while the consequent hypoxic condi - tions may then trigger endothelial hyperproliferation by alter - native compensatory mechanism . From P7 , the super ﬁ cial plexus at the ganglion cell layer ( GCL ) sprouts vertically to form the deep plexus at the outer plexus layer ( OPL ) , followed by the intermediate plexus . The formation of the deep plexus is completed at approximately P12 by reaching the retinal edge , followed by the formation of the intermediate plexus between P12 and P15 ( Stahl et al . , 2010 ) . When vertical sprouts reach the inner and outer borders of the inner nuclear layer ( INL ) , the vessels turn sideways , sprout , and anastomose to form the deep plexus at the OPL . Vertical sprouting vessels can respond sharply to attractive and repulsive stimuli within their micro - environment from the GCL through the INL to the OPL ( Milde et al . , 2013 ) . Though very few studies have been performed to study vertical vessel sprouting , some studies indeed showed that there are distinct molecular differences between the layers . For example , vertical sprouting was completely absent in TSPAN12 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice ( Junge et al . , 2009 ) . Deletion of either Norrin or Frizzled - 4 showed similar defects to those of TSPAN12 ( Wang et al . , 2012 ; Ye et al . , 2009 ) . Snail knockdown decreased vertical sprouting and VEGFR3 mRNA expression , which lead to suppression of formation of the deep plexus ( Park et al . , 2015 ) . Rac1 acts as a mediator of signal transduction by acting as a binary switch , stimulated via guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , which convert Rac1 to its ac - tive form , and GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) , which make Rac1 inactive . Many extracellular molecules stimulate Rac1 - mediated signaling . Rac1 activity is increased by VEGF ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) , S1P ( Tauseef et al . , 2008 ) , platelet activating factor ( Kne - zevic et al . , 2009 ) , interleukin 8 ( Gavard et al . , 2009 ) , and Pros - taglandin E2 or I2 ( Birukova et al . , 2007 ) . In this study , we showed that vertical sprouting , followed by formation of the deep plexus were signi ﬁ cantly suppressed upon deletion of Rac1 . These results raise the possibility that Norrin , Frizzled - 4 , TSPAN12 , and Snail may act upstream or downstream from Rac1 - mediated signaling to promote ECs vertical sprouting activity . Furthermore , the in vivo studies were consistent with the in vitro 3D matrix EC morpho - genic assay models . In this regard , recently developed 3D matrix endothelial experimental models are quite useful to understand the function of molecules and related signaling pathways that control endothelial morphogenesis ( Koh et al . , 2008 ; Uchida et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , our study indicates that Rac1 has an important role in physiological angiogenesis in the retina not only for the formation of super ﬁ cial vascular layers but also for the establishment of in - termediate and deeper blood vessel networks . The precise molecular mechanism by which Rac1 acts in an - giogenesis in vivo is likely to be complex , and yet recent genetic studies may shed light on the critical Rac1 effectors in develop - mental angiogenesis . The active form of Rac1 binds to several downstream targets , which regulate wide variety of cellular functions , such as actin reorganization , superoxide production , gene transcription , and microtubule stability ( Bosco et al . , 2009 ; Ridley , 2006 ; Sawada et al . , 2010 ) . Rac1 regulates the activity of NADPH oxidase , resulting in the production of superoxide radicals ( Diekmann et al . , 1994 ) . Mixed lineage kinase 3 ( MLK3 ) mediates activation of JNK signaling by Rac1 activation ( Teramoto et al . , 1996 ) . Sra1 ( a component of WAVE ) ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ) and IRSp53 ( binds to WAVE ) ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) regulate actin poly - merization as effectors of Rac1 . Intriguingly , WAVE2 global knock - out ( KO ) mice are embryonic lethal with hemorrhage around E10 . 5 , and had no signi ﬁ cant effect on vasculogenesis , but decrease of sprouting and angiogenesis . Furthermore , WAVE2 KO ECs were also impaired in the formation of lamellipodia ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ) . In this regard , these Rac1 effectors , Sra1 , IRSp53 , and WAVE2 might play important roles in developmental angiogen - esis . p21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) are also well recognized as tar - gets of Rac1 ( Hofmann et al . , 2004 ; Radu et al . , 2014 ) . There are six isoforms in mammalian . Among the Group I Paks ( Pak1 – 3 ) , Pak1 is predominantly expressed in brain , muscle , gastrointestinal tract , and thyroid , and Pak3 in brain ( Manser et al . , 1994 ) , whereas Pak2 is globally expressed ( Galan Moya et al . , 2009 ; Kelly et al . , 2013 ) . It still remains unclear which isoforms of PAKs play essential roles in N . Nohata et al . / Developmental Biology 411 ( 2016 ) 183 – 194 192 developmental vascular formation . Pak1 - and Pak3 - knockout ( KO ) mice are viable ( McDaniel et al . , 2008 ; Meng et al . , 2005 ) . Recently , it was demonstrated that Pak2 EC - speci ﬁ c KO ( Tie2 - Cre model ) results in embryonic lethality with impaired blood vessel forma - tion in both mice embryo body and yolk sac ( Radu et al . , 2015 ) , phenocopying our previous Rac1 excision study ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . The results of migrating and sprouting activity in Pak2 - depleted ECs also showed high similarity with those of our present study . Although Pak4 KO are also embryonic lethal ( Qu et al . , 2003 ) , considering the prior genetic studies on Pak2 and the fact that Pak2 is the main isoform expressed in ECs , it is likely that Pak2 is the relevant target of Rac1 among Pak family members . In summary , our study demonstrates that Rac1 is required for embryonic vascular integrity and angiogenesis , as well as for the formation of super ﬁ cial and deep vascular networks in the post - natal developing retina . Consistent with these ﬁ ndings in vivo , in vitro studies using 3D collagen matrix models also revealed that RAC1 is spatially involved in ECs migration , invasion , and radial sprouting activities . Hence , Rac1 and its downstream molecules may represent potential anti - angiogeneic therapeutic targets for the treatment of many human diseases that involve aberrant neovascularization and blood vessel overgrowth .
