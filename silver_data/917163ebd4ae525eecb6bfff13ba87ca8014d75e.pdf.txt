Earlier pandemics have been characterized by age distributions that are distinct from those observed with seasonal inﬂuenza epidemics , with higher attack rates ( and correspondingly increased proportionate or relative mortality ) in younger individuals . While the genesis of protection against infection in older individuals during a pandemic is uncertain , diﬀerential vulnerability to infection by age has important implications for disease dynamics and control , and for choice of optimal vaccination strategies . Age - related vulnerability to infection may explain diﬀerences between school - and community - derived estimates of the reproductive number ( R ) for a newly emerged pandemic strain , and may also help explain the failure of a newly emerged inﬂuenza A ( H1N1 ) virus strain to cause a pandemic in 1977 . Age - related factors may also help explain variability in attack rates , and the size and impact of inﬂuenza epidemics across jurisdictions and between populations . In Canada , such eﬀects have been observed in the apparently increased severity of outbreaks on Indigenous peoples’ reserves . The implications of these patterns for vaccine allocation necessitate targeted research to understand age - related vulnerabilities early in an inﬂuenza pandemic . Key words : Epidemiology , infectious disease dynamics , inﬂuenza , mathematical modelling . INTRODUCTION A pandemic inﬂuenza A ( H1N1 ) virus emerged in Mexico in March 2009 and has subsequently spread rapidly around the world [ 1 ] . The World Health Organization aﬃrmed the existence of the ﬁrst inﬂu - enza pandemic of the 21st century on 11 June 2009 . As with earlier pandemic inﬂuenza strains in 1918 , 1957 and 1968 [ 2 – 6 ] , and as with the ‘Russian ﬂu’ H1N1 outbreak in the late 1970s [ 7 ] , the 2009 pan - demic H1N1 inﬂuenza A virus has been associated with higher attack rates in younger individuals [ 8 , 9 ] , and most early fatalities appear to have occurred in individuals aged < 50 years [ 1 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . This stands in marked contrast to mortality patterns observed during seasonal inﬂuenza epidemics , where mortality is seen predominantly in those at the extremes of age [ 10 ] . This unique pattern means that optimal pandemic response strategies will diﬀer from the well - tested strategies used for seasonal inﬂuenza and therefore , it is critical that we consider the following questions : What are the implications of diﬀerential age - related * Author for correspondence : D .

Why do pan - demics cause a ‘ W - shaped’ pattern of excess relative or absolute mortality ? How can these dynamics help explain the geographic variability in the apparent severity of inﬂuenza pandemics ? How do these dy - namics inﬂuence the choice of disease mitigation and control strategies ? In the following sections we will address each of these questions in the context of pan - demic H1N1 inﬂuenza A ( H1N1 ) virus ( pH1N1 ) . Disease dynamics and W - shaped mortality curves The basic reproductive number of an infectious dis - ease ( R 0 ) can be described as the number of new cases created by a single infected individual in a fully sus - ceptible population . As an example , when R 0 = 3 , each infected individual typically generates three secondary cases before they recover and each of these secondary cases go on to create three additional cases . When R 0 is > 1 , the disease can spread easily throughout the population , causing an epidemic [ 11 ] . However , R 0 is an idealized quantity , and represents the reproductive number of an infectious disease introduced into a completely susceptible population in the absence of intervention ( e . g . no attempt to keep infectious in - dividuals from interacting with susceptible individuals via isolation ) . When these conditions do not apply , the reproductive number is often denoted ‘eﬀective R ’ , or R e . As more individuals begin to acquire immunity ( as a result of previous infection ) , the reproductive number changes from R 0 to a smaller R e because each new case can no longer generate three new secondary cases due to immunity in the popu - lation . The relationship between R 0 and R e in a homogeneously mixed population is simply : R e = R 0 r S , ( 1 ) where S is the fraction of the population susceptible to the infectious disease in question . The distinction between R 0 and R e makes it possible to reconcile the varying estimates of R that have been derived for pH1N1 . For example , Paterson and colleagues investigated an outbreak of pH1N1 at the St Francis Preparatory School in New York early in the 2009 pandemic . Their analysis of the outbreak yielded a reproductive number of 2 . 7 in that particu - lar school setting [ 12 ] . They noted that another recent estimate of the reproductive number in the com - munity setting , based on events in Mexico in April 2009 , was lower ( y 1 . 5 ) [ 13 ] ; we have recently pub - lished similar estimates of community - based repro - ductive numbers for pH1N1 in the Canadian province of Ontario [ 14 ] . Elevated reproductive numbers in school settings could be related to crowding or behavioural factors . However , if notwithstanding the novel nature of pH1N1 , older individuals in the population are par - tially protected against infection by prior exposure to antigenically similar viruses , then the reproductive number estimated in a young population ( i . e . in a school outbreak ) should approximate R 0 ( the repro - ductive number in an entirely susceptible population ) whereas the R estimated by Fraser and colleagues would simply be R e in a partially susceptible popu - lation . Protection in older individuals is consistent with the young age of cases reported in Mexico , USA , Canada , and Japan [ 15 , 16 ] . Younger age distri - butions of cases were also noted in the 1918 , 1957 and 1968 inﬂuenza pandemics [ 2 , 5 , 8 , 9 ] , and have been attributed to early - life exposure to related inﬂuenza strains in older individuals [ 8 ] . Returning to R 0 and R e in a well - mixed population , we can use simple algebra to show that S = R e = R 0 , ( 2 ) If R 0 = 2 . 7 , and R e = 1 . 5 , then R e / R 0 in this case would be y 0 . 55 . It is interesting to note that y 55 % of the USA population is aged < 40 years [ 17 ] . We recently demonstrated that individuals aged > 40 years appear 0 2 4 6 P e r ce n t o f ca s e s ( n = 1819 ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 Age ( years ) Fig . 1 . Age distribution of pandemic inﬂuenza A ( H1N1 ) virus cases in Ontario , Canada . The histograms show the proportion of cases , by age , in individuals testing positive for pandemic inﬂuenza A ( H1N1 ) virus in the Ontario Public Health Laboratory system . Risk of infection de - creases with age , and is rare in individuals born prior to 1957 . Age eﬀects in a pandemic 1543 protected against infection with pH1N1 [ 18 ] . Older individuals may have prior exposure to H1N1 inﬂu - enza strains that circulated each year prior to the 1957 pandemic . Both epidemiological and serological data derived from the current pandemic suggest that in - dividuals born prior to 1957 have a high degree of protection against infection with pH1N1 , and those born between 1957 and 1976 appear to have a degree of protection as well [ 18 , 19 ] . Extending this concept provides an obvious hy - pothesis regarding the non - emergence of a H1N1 pandemic in 1976 – 1977 . As a disease with an initial R e < 1 cannot cause an epidemic following intro - duction , increasing the proportion of individuals in a given population who have pre - existing age - related immunity to a novel inﬂuenza strain decreases the likelihood of pandemic occurrence . The failure of the Russian ﬂu H1N1 inﬂuenza strain that emerged in 1977 to cause a pandemic may have , again , reﬂected population exposure to similar H1N1 strains that were circulating prior to 1957 [ 7 ] . However , in this situation , a much higher proportion of the population ( all individuals aged > 20 years ) would have had extensive prior exposure to H1N1 , driving down S . During the Russian ﬂu episode , attack rates > 70 % were observed in many high schools and military bases within the USA , but very few cases were ob - served in teachers , faculty members or staﬀ making ‘Russian ﬂu’ an epidemic only in the young , and not a true pandemic [ 7 ] . The atypical pattern of mortality associated with some pandemics , with elevated relative or absolute risk in individuals in the middle years of life , has been described as ‘ W - shaped’ , to denote the ap - pearance of histograms of fatalities by age [ 4 ] . Such a pattern emerged in the 2009 pandemic [ 1 , 20 ] and was famously associated with the 1918 inﬂuenza pan - demic [ 4 ] . However , such a pattern was also present in the 1957 pandemic when relative , rather than absolute , risk of mortality is considered ( i . e . the in - crease in pneumonia and inﬂuenza - related mortality in younger individuals relative to that seen in the preceding inﬂuenza season was far greater than that seen in older individuals [ 3 ] ) . Limited data suggest that W - shaped relative mortality patterns may have existed during the presumed 1837 inﬂuenza pandemic as well [ 21 ] . The signature W - shaped mortality identiﬁed in inﬂuenza pandemics may be seen entirely as a result of diﬀerences in age - related risk of infection , without the need to invoke diﬀerences in age - speciﬁc risk of poor outcome between seasonal and pandemic strains . In other words , it is not necessary to invoke the pres - ence of a superantigen response in a subset of other - wise healthy young adults [ 22 ] in order to make sense of W - shaped mortality . This concept is illustrated graphically in the schematic diagram presented as Figure 2 . It can be seen that when a disease process that is associated with U - shaped case - fatality , such as seasonal inﬂuenza ( which has highest case - fatality rates in the youngest and oldest individuals ) occurs with attack rates that diminish with age ( as is charac - teristic of pandemic inﬂuenza ) , the result is a W - shaped distribution of mortality by age . It may be surprising that a temporally distant in - ﬂuenza virus exposure would confer protection , when little durable immunity is conferred by seasonal ex - posure to closely related inﬂuenza strains as a result of antigenic drift [ 23 ] . However , this eﬀect may be con - sistent with the immunological model of ‘original antigenic sin’ [ 24 – 26 ] , which suggests that the ﬁrst exposure to an antigen provokes a strong humoral immune response ; as inﬂuenza antigens drift over time , neutralizing antibodies become less eﬀective , but re - challenge provokes expansion of the original B - memory response . A recent study evaluating banked sera from prior to the onset of the current pandemic has identiﬁed a high prevalence of cross - reactive neutralizing antibody to pH1N1 in older individuals , particularly those aged > 60 years [ 19 ] . 0 0·2 0·4 0·6 0·8 1·0 Increasing age 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 A tt ac k r a t e ( % ) o r d ea t h s p e r 1000 C a s e - f a t a lit y r a t e ( % ) Fig . 2 .

Fisman In this instance , it might be expected that pan - demic H1N1 haemagglutinin ( HA1 ) genes would bear similarity to those of inﬂuenza A strains circulating prior to 1957 . Preliminary evaluations of archived HA1 sequences in Genbank [ 27 ] do not suggest a close relationship between pH1N1 and pre - 1957 H1N1 strains , but the complexity of such comparisons and gaps in knowledge of pre - 1957 viral sequences suggest that this hypothesis warrants further investigation . Implications for populations with low mean age Increased susceptibility to pH1N1 infection in younger individuals , relative to older adults , would have sev - eral important epidemiological implications : it sug - gest that schools , universities , military bases , and other areas with large concentrations of younger in - dividuals will be major foci for pandemic inﬂuenza outbreaks . Similarly , it means that optimal vacci - nation strategies target younger adults than are usually targeted in seasonal inﬂuenza vaccination campaigns [ 9 ] ; and it means that low - income countries or speciﬁc segments of the population , which have ‘triangular’ population distributions ( younger individuals greatly in excess of older individuals ) will have attack rates higher than seen in countries with larger proportions of older individuals . In Canada , Indigenous populations have been severely impacted by the introduction and spread of pH1N1 in isolated communities [ 28 , 29 ] . Although this severity has been attributed to crowding and high rates of underlying illness in Indigenous communities [ 28 – 30 ] , and could also reﬂect diﬀerential functioning of surveillance systems in diﬀerent communities , a striking feature of these communities is that the age distribution of community members tends to be younger than the general Canadian population . In contrast to the general Canadian population where y 43 % of the population are aged < 34 years and 26 % are aged > 52 years , 60 % of Indigenous com - munities are aged < 34 years and only y 14 % are aged > 52 years [ 31 ] . We recently published data from Ontario demonstrating that the relative risk of infection with pH1N1 is y 0 . 42 in individuals aged 33 – 52 years ( i . e . those born between the 1957 and 1968 pandemics ) , and 0 . 15 in individuals aged o 53 years ( i . e . those born prior to the 1957 pan - demic ) [ 18 ] . If we assume that the risk of exposure suﬃcient to transmit infection ( P exp ) does not vary across age groups then we can estimate a crude relative risk for Canadian Indigenous communities , relative to the Canadian population as a whole as follows , using the age distributions and relative risks described above : RR FN = Risk FN = Risk Can = ( P exp r 1 r 0 (cid:1) 6 + P exp r 0 (cid:1) 42 r 0 (cid:1) 26 + P exp r 0 (cid:1) 15 r 0 (cid:1) 14 ) ( P exp r 1 r 0 (cid:1) 43 + P exp r 0 (cid:1) 42 r 0 (cid:1) 29 + P exp r 0 (cid:1) 15 r 0 (cid:1) 26 ) , = ( 1 r 0 (cid:1) 6 + 0 (cid:1) 42 r 0 (cid:1) 26 + 0 (cid:1) 15 r 0 (cid:1) 14 ) ( 1 r 0 (cid:1) 43 + 0 (cid:1) 42 r 0 (cid:1) 29 + 0 (cid:1) 15 r 0 (cid:1) 26 ) , = 0 (cid:1) 73 = 0 (cid:1) 59 , = 1 (cid:1) 24 : In other words , although poverty and associated crowding could result in higher attack rates in Indigenous populations in Canada , we would expect the risk of infection to be 24 % higher in Indigenous Canadians than in other Canadians on the basis of age distribution alone , with the attributable risk per - cent for infection in Indigenous Canadians being equal to 19 % . However , the relative risk of infection in some Indigenous communities during the ﬁrst wave of the 2009 inﬂuenza pandemic appeared many times higher than that seen in the general Canadian population [ 29 ] . How can these diﬀerences be re - conciled ? To understand that these observations are not in - consistent , it is important to recall that epidemics are dynamic , time - dependent processes , with risk of in - fection for individuals evolving over the course of an epidemic . We can capture the dynamic character of an epidemic by representing it in terms of reproductive numbers . Assume there is universal susceptibility to novel pH1N1 in young individuals , and universal exposure to pH1N1 . In that case , the proportion of the population susceptible ( S ) to infection in Canada’s Indigenous peoples would be Risk FN of 0 . 73 . Assum - ing that the R 0 is truly 2 . 7 , and using equation ( 1 ) , we can estimate that R e in this population would be 0 . 73 r 2 . 7 , or 2 . 0 ; the corresponding value for R e in the general Canadian population would be 1 . 6 . Figure 3 shows simulated epidemic curves and cumulative attack rates associated with infections with R = 2 . 0 and R = 1 . 6 , respectively . It can be seen that the simulated epidemic curve for the Indigenous population peaks earlier and has a narrower base than that for the general Canadian population . The ratio of cumulative attack rates ( i . e . cumulative attack rate in the Indigenous community divided by the cumu - lative attack rate in the general population ) at any point in time will be the estimated relative risk of in - fection available to public health practitioners at that point in time . In Figure 4 , these ratios are plotted ( on Age eﬀects in a pandemic 1545 a log scale ) over time ; because of the earlier peak of the epidemic in the younger ( Indigenous ) population the relative risk in this population is extremely high ( y 40 ) ; as the epidemic wanes in this population , and takes oﬀ in the general population , the relative risk declines . The relative risk of infection at the end of the epidemic is simply the ratio of ﬁnal epidemic sizes derived using the Kermack – McKendrick ‘ﬁnal size formula’ [ 32 ] , which in this case is 0 . 79 / 0 . 64 , or 1 . 23 , almost identical to the relative risk estimated using age - weighted estimates of risk and much smaller than the relative risk estimates derived by taking ratios of attack rates early on . The key , however , is that in younger populations , the epidemic takes a more rapid course with an earlier peak , which may have the practical eﬀects of over - whelming public health and hospital resources , causing concern or panic in the population , and / or occurring entirely before implementation of pro - grammes aimed at mitigation of the epidemic ( e . g . vaccine programmes ) can be put into place . This phenomenon will apply in any population with the ‘triangular’ age distribution characteristic of lower - income regions and countries , and may help explain some of the apparent geographic variation in severity characteristic of inﬂuenza pandemics [ 6 ] . Optimal disease mitigation and control Seasonal inﬂuenza vaccination campaigns typically target the elderly and those of any age with one or more chronic medical conditions , to protect those most at risk of complications from infection . The diﬀerent relationship between age and disease risk in seasonal inﬂuenza epidemics [ 33 , 34 ] compared to inﬂuenza pandemics [ 8 , 9 , 35 ] means that seasonal vaccination frameworks are not likely to be applicable in a pandemic situation . Miller and colleagues have pointed out that if the goal of vaccination in a pan - demic is to minimize life - years lost , strategies need to be ‘pandemic - speciﬁc’ , and reﬂect the age distribution of cases [ 9 ] . ( Of note , Galvani and colleagues have also pointed out that because of their relative mobility and high rates of contact with others , vaccine stra - tegies targeting younger individuals at diminished risk of poor outcomes may actually be optimal in seasonal inﬂuenza as well [ 36 ] . ) In the face of a higher force of infection in younger persons with the currently circulating pandemic strain , the apparent protection against infection in older adults , and the expectation that initial vaccine supplies were expected to be insuﬃcient to vaccinate the entire population , many jurisdictions have implemented alternate vaccination strategies that re - ﬂected age - related changes in susceptibility to infec - tion [ 37 , 38 ] . The WHO pH1N1 vaccine allocation guidelines also reﬂected the observed pH1N1 age - infection risk distribution , with younger adults rec - ommended for prioritization for vaccine receipt over older adults [ 39 ] .

The earlier epidemic peak in the younger population results in an extremely high relative risk of in - fection early in the epidemic . The relative risk of infection when the epidemic ends is the ratio of the ﬁnal epidemic sizes in the two populations ( relative risk y 1 . 25 ) . 1546 A . L . Greer , A . Tuite and D . N . Fisman on children and younger adults was adopted as a means of eﬀectively targeting the groups with the highest expected disease burden , as well as those most responsible for disease transmission [ 40 ] . The eﬀec - tiveness of these alternative vaccination schemes in reducing the population - level impact of pH1N1 re - mains to be determined , although the delayed avail - ability of vaccine in the northern hemisphere , relative to the peak of pH1N1 activity probably reduced the utility of vaccination in general as a disease mitigation tool [ 41 ] . In the absence of vaccine or other pharmaceutical interventions ( i . e . antiviral treatment or prophylaxis ) , social distancing measures , including school closures and cancellation of large public gatherings , are an ef - fective strategy for controlling inﬂuenza transmission [ 42 , 43 ] . Models suggest that school closures would act synergistically with other control interventions [ 44 ] . Closures were implemented in Mexico and other jurisdictions early in the pandemic [ 45 , 46 ] , but school closures were not widely adopted due to their high economic costs and disruptive nature . Finally , as might be expected given pH1N1’s pro - pensity to spread in susceptible populations , summer camps , which have large groups of children and young adults in close contact , were also observed to be hotspots for pH1N1 [ 47 ] . In the northern hemi - sphere , continued spread of pH1N1 during the summer months , when inﬂuenza activity generally declines , was a surprising phenomenon . Seasonal os - cillation has resulted in an apparent increase in R 0 for pH1N1 in North America in autumn 2009 [ 23 ] , a phenomenon that could be related to either environ - mental or social phenomena ( e . g . reopening of schools and universities closed during the summer ) . CONCLUSION As with previous pandemics , the 2009 emergence of pH1N1 strain has been associated with age - related risks of infection that are distinct from those seen during seasonal inﬂuenza epidemics . The dynamics of disease transmission and corresponding public - health planning priorities and intervention strategies will diﬀer depending on the age distribution of cases . As such , we echo the recommendations of Miller and colleagues , who note that rapid assessment of the relationship between age and infection risk needs to be a high priority for research with the emergence of an inﬂuenza strain with pandemic potential [ 9 ] . More broadly , however , the contrast between age eﬀects in inﬂuenza pandemics relative to those seen in seasonal epidemics , may be an important clue into the evolution , dynamics , emergence , and apparent dis - appearance of inﬂuenza strains over time .
