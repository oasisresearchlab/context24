ORIGINAL ARTICLE Talin1 phosphorylation activates β 1 integrins : a novel mechanism to promote prostate cancer bone metastasis J - K Jin 1 , 2 , P - C Tien 1 , C - J Cheng 3 , JH Song 1 , C Huang 4 , S - H Lin 1 , 2 , 5 and GE Gallick 1 , 2 Talins are adaptor proteins that regulate focal adhesion signaling by conjugating integrins to the cytoskeleton . Talins directly bind integrins and are essential for integrin activation . We previously showed that β 1 integrins are activated in metastatic prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells , increasing PCa metastasis to lymph nodes and bone . However , how β 1 integrins are activated in PCa cells is unknown . In this study , we identi ﬁ ed a novel mechanism of β 1 integrin activation . Using knockdown experiments , we ﬁ rst demonstrated that talin1 , but not talin2 , is important in β 1 integrin activation . We next showed that talin1 S425 phosphorylation , but not total talin1 expression , correlates with metastatic potential of PCa cells . Expressing a non - phosphorylatable mutant , talin1 S425A , in talin1 - silenced PC3 - MM2 and C4 - 2B4 PCa cells , decreased activation of β 1 integrins , integrin - mediated adhesion , motility and increased the sensitivity of the cells to anoikis . In contrast , reexpression of the phosphorylation - mimicking mutant talin1 S425D led to increased β 1 integrin activation and generated biologic effects opposite to talin1 S425A expression . In the highly metastatic PC3 - MM2 cells , expression of a non - phosphorylatable mutant , talin1 S425A , in talin1 - silenced PC3 - MM2 cells , abolished their ability to colonize in the bone following intracardiac injection , while reexpression of phosphorylation - mimicking mutant talin1 S425D restored their ability to metastasize to bone . Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that talin S425 phosphorylation is signi ﬁ cantly increased in human bone metastases when compared with normal tissues , primary tumors or lymph node metastases . We further showed that p35 expression , an activator of Cdk5 , and Cdk5 activity were increased in metastatic tumor cells , and that Cdk5 kinase activity is responsible for talin1 phosphorylation and subsequent β 1 integrin activation . Together , our study reveals Cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation of talin1 leading to β 1 integrin activation is a novel mechanism that increases metastatic potential of PCa cells . Oncogene ( 2015 ) 34 , 1811 – 1821 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2014 . 116 ; published online 5 May 2014 INTRODUCTION Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the western world with a total of nearly 122 000 deaths anticipated in 2013 . 1 , 2 Patients with organ - con ﬁ ned PCa are usually successfully treated , but for those with distant metastases , the 5 - year survival decreases to 28 % . 2 Although numerous alterations in both tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment are required for metastasis of solid tumors , 3 recent studies have implicated aberrant expression of talin in promoting such critical steps in metastasis as adhesion , migration , invasion , cellular survival and proliferation . 4 – 6 Two distinct talin genes ( talin1 and talin2 , 74 % sequence identity ) are expressed in vertebrates , with talin1 expressed in nearly every tissue and talin2 normally expressed primarily in heart , brain , testis and muscles . 7 – 9 Talins are located at the adhesion complex between cells and their extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , and regulate integrin and focal adhesion signaling . 10 Structurally , the ‘ talin head ’ is comprised largely of a FERM domain , which is linked to a structure termed the ‘ talin rod ’ , a long carboxy - terminal region . 11 , 12 Major insights into the principal function of talins were derived from experiments demonstrating that the talin head binds the cytoplasmic tails of β integrin subunits , 13 leading to the ﬁ nal step in ‘ inside - out ’ integrin activation . 14 Talin also functions as an adaptor protein as it can also bind vinculin , FAK and actin , thereby conjugating integrins to the cytoskeleton , 15 and further promoting integrin - mediated signal transduction . Talin is phosphorylated at multiple sites . 16 One of the phosphorylation sites in talin is S425 , which is phosphorylated by Cdk5 . 17 Phosphorylation of talin on S425 was shown to affect talin protein stability and ubiquitylation , 17 but potential roles of this phosphorylation in integrin binding have not been assessed previously . Our laboratories have focused on the roles of β 1 integrins in PCa metastasis . Using a conformation - speci ﬁ c antibody , we demonstrated that β 1 integrins are constitutively activated in PCa cell lines with high metastatic potential , but not in cancer cell lines with low metastatic potential . 18 Activation of β 1 integrins promotes resistance to anoikis through activation of FAK / Akt - mediated survival pathway ; and neutralizing β 1 integrin activation 1 Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology , Unit 18 - 4 , David H .

In this study , we demonstrate that talin1 S425 phosphorylation is required for β 1 integrin activation in PCa cells and bone colonization of metastatic PCa cells following intracardiac injec - tion . We further demonstrate that increased activity of Cdk5 in metastatic PCa cells is directly responsible for talin1 S425 phosphorylation . These results provide a novel mechanism by which talin1 leads to inside - out activation of β 1 integrins , and further provides a mechanism by which talin1 S425 phosphorylation - mediated integrin activation promotes meta - static potential of PCa cells . RESULTS Talin1 S425 phosphorylation correlates with β 1 integrin activation in PCa cells We previously demonstrated that β 1 integrins were constitutively activated in metastatic PC3 and PC3 - MM2 cells relative to less metastatic LNCaP and C4 - 2B4 cells . 18 We further examined β 1 integrin activation by immuno ﬂ uorescence staining using a conformation - speci ﬁ c antibody ( mAb 12G10 ) . Activation of β 1 integrins , determined by ﬂ uorescence area , was 20 - fold higher in metastatic PC3 - MM2 cells as compared with low metastatic C4 - 2B4 cells ( Figure 1a ) . As talin is required for inside - out integrin activation and is overexpressed in PCa , 4 we determined whether talin expression contributes to constitutive β 1 integrin activation . Because talins are expressed from two genes , talin1 and talin2 , we ﬁ rst compared the effect of talin1 and talin2 in β 1 integrin activation by gene silencing in PC3 - MM2 cells . Silencing of talin1 did not affect the expression of talin2 ( Figure 1b ) . Although both talin1 and talin2 are expressed in PC3 - MM2 cells , talin1 is far more abundant , as total talin1 and talin2 , detected by the pan - talin antibody , 8D4 , was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in talin1 - silenced cells ( Figure 1b ) . In addition , talin1 - silenced cells possessed a rounded morphology and impaired spreading ( Supplementary Figure S1b ) , a phenotype not observed in talin2 - silenced cells ( Supplementary Figure S1a , b ) . Next , the levels of total and activated β 1 integrins in talin1 and talin2 - silenced PC3 - MM2 cells were determined . Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that silencing of talin1 ( Figure 1c ) , but not talin2 ( Supplementary Figure S1c ) , reduced β 1 integrin activation , without affecting expression of total β 1 integrins . These results demonstrate that talin1 , but not talin2 , is primarily responsible for β 1 integrin activation in PCa cells . To determine the correlation of talin1 expression with β 1 integrin activation , we examined talin1 expression in low metastatic LNCaP , C4 - 2B4 , metastatic PC3 and PC3 - MM2 cells . The level of talin1 expression was similar in each cell line ( Figure 1d ) . These results suggest that increased talin1 expression alone is insuf ﬁ - cient to activate β 1 integrins . As talin phosphorylation on S425 is also associated with some integrin functions such as migration , 17 we next examined talin1 and talin2 phosphorylation on S425 by immunoblotting . Talin ( comprising talin1 and talin2 ) was highly phosphorylated on S425 in metastatic PC3 and PC3 - MM2 cells compared with low metastatic LNCaP and C4 - 2B4 cells ( Figure 1d ) . To examine talin1 phosphorylation speci ﬁ cally , cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a talin1 - speci ﬁ c antibody , followed by immunoblotting with talin S425 phosphorylation . Talin1 was highly phosphorylated in PC3 and PC3 - MM2 cells ( Figure 1e ) , consistent with immunoblotting observed from whole cell lysates ( Figure 1d ) . These results demonstrate that levels of talin1 S425 phosphorylation correlate with activated β 1 integrins in PC3 - MM2 cells . Talin1 S425 phosphorylation promotes β 1 integrin activation To determine if talin1 S425 phosphorylation were required for β 1 integrin activation , we silenced endogenous talin1 and stably expressed either talin1 wild - type ( GFP - talin1 WT ) , a non - phosphorylatable mutant ( GFP - talin1 S425A ) or a phosphorylation - mimicking mutant ( GFP - talin1 S425D ) in PC3 - MM2 and C4 - 2B4 cells as described in Materials and Methods . Levels of expression of each form of talin1 were similar ( Figure 2a ) . Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that talin1 WT expressed in talin1 - silenced PC3 - MM2 cells restored β 1 integrin activation ( Figure 2b ) . In contrast , expression of talin1 S425A inhibited β 1 integrin activation by 60 % , whereas talin1 S425D promoted β 1 integrin activation by 76 % relative to talin1 WT . Similar results were observed when talin1 WT and mutants were expressed in C4 - 2B4 cells in which endogenous talin1 was silenced ( Figure 2c ) . We further assessed the effects of talin1 phosphorylation on β 1 integrin activation by immuno ﬂ uorescence staining . In agreement with the ﬂ ow cytometric analysis , fewer activated β 1 integrins were expressed in talin1 S425A cells relative to talin1 WT cells , whereas talin1 S425D cells increased clustering of active β 1 integrins ( Figure 2d ) . Next , we examined whether talin1 phosphorylation affects downstream integrin signaling . The PC3 - MM2 talin1 S425A cells were decreased in expression of pFAK Y397 , pp130 Cas Y165 and pAkt S473 but not total FAK , p130 Cas or Akt ( Figure 2e ) , consistent with decreased signaling through activated β 1 integrins . Similarly , in talin1 - silenced cells , pFAK Y397 , pp130 Cas Y165 and pAkt S473 were decreased with no decrease in expression of these proteins ; whereas in cells retransfected with talin1 WT , activation of these downstream intermediates was restored . Together , these results demonstrate that talin1 S425 phosphorylation promotes β 1 integrin activation and downstream signaling in metastatic PCa cells . Effects of talin1 S425 phosphorylation on anoikis resistance , adhesion and motility We previously demonstrated that increased β 1 integrin activation promoted anoikis resistance , and increased adhesion and motility in PC3 - MM2 cells . 18 To determine the effect of talin1 S425 phosphorylation on these biologic properties , we used the PC3 - MM2 and C4 - 2B4 cells described above expressing talin1 WT and mutants . Expression of talin1 WT , integrin - activating and - inhibiting talin1 mutant proteins had no affect on proliferation rates of PC3 - MM2 cells or C4 - 2B4 cells ( Supplementary Figure S2a ) . However , in suspension ( anoikis conditions ) , 30 % of the non - phosphorylatable talin1 S425A - expressing cells died after 24 h and 40 % after 48 h ( Figure 3a ) . In contrast , no cell death was observed in both talin1 WT and talin1 S425D cells after 24 h . After 48 h , 35 % talin1 WT cells died , similar to talin1 S425A , but only 16 % talin1 S425D died ( Figure 3a ) . To determine if effects on viability were due to changes in apoptosis , propidium iodide staining was performed . A twofold increase in the sub - G0 / G1 population was observed in talin1 S425A cells compared with talin1 WT cells after 24 h ( Figure 3b ) . After 48 h , the sub - G0 / G1 population in talin1 WT cells and talin1 S425A cells was similar , whereas talin1 S425D cells were still resistant to anoikis ( Figure 3b ) . As a second measure of apoptosis , Poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) cleavage was examined . PARP cleavage occurred in talin1 S425A cells by 24 h , but no PARP cleavage was observed in talin1 S425D cells even after 48 h ( Figure 3c ) . Thus , increased anoikis resistance was associated with talin1 S425 phosphorylation . We next determined whether talin1 S425 phosphorylation promoted attachment of metastatic PCa cells to ECM . For these analyses , talin1 WT and mutant - expressing cells were subjected to adhesion to ﬁ bronectin and collagen I - coated culture plates . Binding of PC3 - MM2 cells expressing talin1 S425A to ﬁ bronectin was decreased by 74 % and to collagen I by 81 % relative to talin1 WT cells ( Figure 3d ) .

Very similar results were observed in adhesion assays when these mutants were expressed in C4 - 2B4 cells ( Supplementary Figure S2b ) . We next determined whether talin1 phosphorylation promotes motility of PCa cells on ECM . Migration assays were performed using collagen I - coated modi ﬁ ed Boyden chambers . The ability of PC3 - MM2 cells expressing talin1 S425A to migrate on collagen I was reduced 52 % ( 62 % in C4 - 2B4 cells expressing talin1 S425A ) as compared with talin1 WT cells , whereas the migratory ability of talin1 S425D - expressing PC3 - MM2 cells was increased by 30 % ( 55 % in C4 - 2B4 cells expressing talin1 S425D ) relative to respective wild - type transfected cells ( Figure 3e ) , again correlating with the level of β 1 integrin activation . Similar results were observed in invasion assays , in which cells invaded through Matrigel - coated modi ﬁ ed Boyden chambers .

Talin S425 phosphorylation is mediated by p35 activation of Cdk5 Next , we determined the mechanism by which talin1 S425 phosphorylation is increased in metastatic PCa cells . Previous work in neuronal cells demonstrated that talin phosphorylation on S425 is catalyzed by Cdk5 . 17 We therefore determined whether Cdk5 was responsible for talin1 S425 phosphorylation in PCa cells . For these studies , both Cdk5 expression and kinase activity were determined . Expression of Cdk5 by immunoblotting was similar in LNCaP , C4 - 2B4 , PC3 and PC3 - MM2 cells ( Figure 4a ) . As p35 has been shown to be the principal activator of Cdk5 , 19 , 20 and Cdk5 and p35 are both widely expressed in PCa , 21 we examined the expression of p35 in high metastatic PC3 , and PC3 - MM2 cells , and the low metastatic LNCaP and C4 - 2B4 cells . Expression of p35 correlated with metastatic potential of these cells , suggesting that p35 is responsible for Cdk5 activation ( Figure 4a ) . Cdk5 activity ( as assessed by ADP production through ADP - Glo Kinase Assay kit as described in Materials and methods ) increased in PC3 ( twofold relative to LNCaP ) and PC3 - MM2 cells ( 2 . 5 - fold relative to LNCaP ; Figure 4b ) . Inhibition of Cdk5 by the Cdk inhibitor , roscovitine , reduced talin1 phosphorylation in PC3 - MM2 cells in a time - dependent manner ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) , suggesting that Cdk5 might be responsible for talin1 phosphorylation . To examine directly whether Cdk5 mediated talin1 phosphorylation , Cdk5 was silenced in PC3 - MM2 and C4 - 2B4 cells . The results demonstrated that talin1 phosphorylation was decreased by ~ 90 % ( Figure 4c ) .

Phospho - talin1 S425 in prostate cancer metastasis J - K Jin et al 1815 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1811 – 1821 To examine whether Cdk5 kinase activity were required for talin1 phosphorylation , PCa cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid directing the expression of a dominant - negative Myc - Cdk5 . 17 Expression of this dominant - negative mutant inhibited talin1 phosphorylation in both PC3 - MM2 and C4 - 2B4 cells ( Figure 4d ) . These results demonstrate that Cdk5 activity , but not expression , promotes talin1 S425 phosphorylation in PCa cells . We next determined whether Cdk5 regulates β 1 integrin activation . Silencing Cdk5 resulted in reduced β 1 integrin activation in PC3 - MM2 cells ( Figure 4e ) , suggesting that Cdk5 is required for β 1 integrin activation . Next , we silenced Cdk5 in PC3 - MM2 cells in which talin1 was silenced and talin1 WT or talin1 S425D mutants were reexpressed ( Figure 4f ) . As expected , silencing Cdk5 inhibited β 1 integrin activation in talin1 WT cells , but did not affect β 1 integrin activation in phospho - mimicking talin1 S425D cells ( Figure 4g ) . These observations demonstrate that Cdk5 phosphor - ylates talin1 on S425 , and its activity promotes β 1 integrin activation . Talin1 S425 phosphorylation promotes PCa bone metastasis We determined whether talin S425 phosphorylation promoted metastasis in nude mouse models . To determine bone metastasis of disseminated tumor cells , intracardiac injections were per - formed ( experimental metastasis ) . For these experiments , ﬁ rst , the sh - control , talin1 - silenced , talin1 wild - type and mutated talin1 - expressing PC3 - MM2 cells were transduced with a plasmid directing luciferase expression .

Phospho - talin1 S425 in prostate cancer metastasis J - K Jin et al 1816 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1811 – 1821 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited of cells , bioluminescence imaging of mice was performed weekly . The presence of tumor in bone was examined by co - localization of X - ray and bioluminescence imaging . A representative image of mice inoculated with cells expressing each construct is shown in Figure 5a . No tumor growth was observed in any animal in the bone of talin1 - silenced and talin1 S425A groups . In contrast , three of four talin1 WT mice and four of ﬁ ve talin1 S425D mice demonstrated tumor growth . Tumors were noted in both legs of mice as expected in this model as well as in the heads of mice as previously observed 18 , 22 ( for examples of bioluminescence ima - ging , see Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Thus , blocking talin1 S425 phosphorylation completely inhibited bone metastasis of disse - minated PC3 - MM2 cells in this model . For tumors that grew , tumor size was estimated by bioluminescence imaging 7 , 14 and 21 days post - intracardiac injection . Exponential growth was observed in sh - control , talin1 WT and talin1 S425D groups , with no difference in talin1 WT and talin1 S425D observed ( Figure 5b ) . We next examined whether talin1 phosphorylation affects lymph node metastasis ( spontaneous metastasis ) of tumor cells injected orthotopically into the prostate . Mice were killed when primary tumors reached a similar size ( Figure 5c ) , and lymph node metastases were detected by bioluminescence imaging ( Figure 5d ) . Lymph nodes were excised and tumor was con ﬁ rmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining . Lymph node metastases developed in all groups ( PC3 - MM2 cells expressing talin1 WT , talin1 S425A and talin1 S425D mutants ; Figure 5d ) ; however , as shown sh - Control sh - Talin1 Talin1 WT Talin1 S425A Talin1 S425D Bone MetastasisIncidence ( 3 / 4 ) max 720 Luminescence 7 days 14 days 21 days T o t a l f l u x ( pho t on s / s e c ) 10 5 0 10 6 10 7 s h - C on t r o l s h - T a li n1 W T W T S 425 A S 425 D s h - C on t r o l s h - T a li n1 S 425 A S 425 D W T s h - C on t r o l s h - T a li n1 S 425 A S 425 D Talin1 S425A Talin1 WT Talin1 S425D T a li n 1 W T T a li n1 S 425 A T a li n1 S 425 D Lu m i ne sc en c e x10 8 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 245 min 364 482 601 ( 4 / 5 ) ( 0 / 5 ) * ( 3 / 4 ) ( 0 / 4 ) * Figure 5 .

Phospho - talin1 S425 in prostate cancer metastasis J - K Jin et al 1817 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1811 – 1821 in Table 1 , signi ﬁ cantly fewer lymph node metastases were observed in talin1 S425A mice compared with talin1 WT mice . Together , our results are consistent with talin1 S425 phosphoryla - tion promoting metastasis . Talin S425 phosphorylation in human PCa specimens To determine clinical relevance of talin S425 phosphorylation in PCa , we performed immunohistochemical analysis on formalin - ﬁ xed human prostate tumor specimens . We examined total talin1 expression in normal glands as well as primary tumors and lymph node metastases . Results were consistent with a previous report demonstrating that talin1 expression increases in progressive statuses of PCa . 4 Next , we examined talin S425 phosphorylation in human primary tumors , lymph node metastases and bone metastases by immunohistochemistry . The talin S425 phospho - speci ﬁ c antibody used in the immunohistochemical analysis was validated using a blocking peptide ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Representative images of normal glands , primary tumors , lymph node metastases and bone metastases are shown in Figure 6a . Talin phosphorylation was not detected in normal or atrophied glands ( Figure 6a ) , while 8 of 20 ( 40 % ) primary tumors and 6 of 13 ( 46 % ) lymph node metastases stained positive ( Figure 6b ) . Phospho - talin S425 was observed in 16 of 20 ( 80 % ) bone metastases , a signi ﬁ cant increase compared with either primary prostate tumors ( P = 0 . 009 ) , or to lymph node metastases ( P = 0 . 043 ; Figure 6b ) . There was no correlation between talin phosphorylation and Gleason score . These data demonstrate that increased talin S425 phosphorylation is associated with PCa bone metastasis . DISCUSSION In this work , we demonstrate the importance of talin1 S425 phosphorylation for inside - out activation of β 1 integrins and promotion of PCa bone metastasis . Talin1 S425 phosphorylation is signi ﬁ cantly increased in human bone metastases relative to primary tumors or lymph node metastases . Using phosphorylation - mimicking and non - phosphorylatable talin1 mutants , we demonstrated that talin1 S425 phosphorylation has an important role in β 1 integrin activation , cell adhesion , Table 1 .

( c ) Model of β 1 integrin activation by talin1 S425 phosphorylation in metastatic PCa cells . ( 1 ) Overexpression of p35 increases Cdk5 activity in tumor cells of high metastatic potential , increasing phosphorylation of talin1 on S425 , which induces a conformational change leading to talin1 activation . Binding of additional proteins may facilitate this conformational change . ( 2 ) Phosphorylated talin1 binds to the cytoplasmic tail of β 1 integrin and ( 3 ) increases β 1 integrin activation and ( 4 ) promotes integrin signaling , leading to increased survival , adhesion , motility and metastatic potential of PCa cells . Phospho - talin1 S425 in prostate cancer metastasis J - K Jin et al 1818 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1811 – 1821 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited migration , invasion and anoikis in vitro and metastasis of PCa cells to bone in vivo . Mechanistically , we demonstrated that talin1 S425 phosphorylation is catalyzed by Cdk5 , and that Cdk5 activity is increased in highly metastatic PCa cells corresponding with an increase in its activator , p35 , 19 , 20 as compared with poorly metastatic PCa cells . Together , these results provide a novel mechanism by which p35 - Cdk5 - ptalin1 - S425 - β 1 integrin activa - tion has a role in the metastatic progression of PCa in bone ( summarized in the model in Figure 6c ) . Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in talin binding to the cytoplasmic tail of β integrins . In the ‘ closed ’ , autoinhibited conformation , talin1 exists as a dimer that masks its integrin and actin - binding domains . 11 For either inside - out or outside - in integrin activation , talin must assume an ‘ open ’ conformation . 14 , 23 Several mechanisms may relieve this inhibitory conformation , including binding phosphotidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , 24 , 25 calpain cleavage , 26 binding kindlin and RIAM 27 , 28 and constitutive Rap1 activation . 29 Important to our study , the talin1 linker domain , where S425 is located , also binds the central portion of its rod domain . 11 Thus , phosphorylation of talin1 on S425 is predicted to promote an ‘ open ’ conformation . Overexpression of talin occurs in several solid tumors , including PCa , 4 oral squamous cell carcinoma 5 and ovarian serous carcinoma , 6 with overexpression correlating with higher tumor grade and metastasis . 4 – 6 In these studies , phosphorylation of talin was not examined ; therefore , overexpression and phosphorylation may not be mutually exclusive mechanisms for β 1 integrin activation . We previously demonstrated that constitutive activation of β 1 integrins speci ﬁ cally correlates with metastatic potential of established PCa cell lines , and blocking of β 1 integrin activation with a monoclonal antibody ( mAb 33B6 ) decreased metastatic growth . 18 In this study , we showed that activation of β 1 integrins by talin S425 phosphorylation provides a molecular mechanism of inside - out integrin activation important to PCa bone metastasis . We speculate that this process occurs through increasing the interaction of tumor cell β 1 integrins with bone stroma . During PCa bone metastasis , heterodimerization of integrin subunits is altered , allowing interaction with ECM in the bone matrix . 30 Several β 1 integrin family proteins binding ECM proteins have been shown mediate tumor cell interaction with both the bone matrix and with stromal cells . For example , expression of α 5 β 1 integrins facilitates adhesion and spreading of PC3 cells on ﬁ bronectin . 31 Blocking α 5 β 1 integrins by monoclonal antibodies inhibits adhesion of DU - 145 PCa cell to bone marrow stromal cells . 31 , 32 Another β 1 integrin family protein , α 2 β 1 , has been shown to increase migration and adhesion of collagen - binding LNCaP cells on collagen I , and promotes bone metastasis in vivo . 33 , 34 Similar to α 5 β 1 , α 2 β 1 was found to mediate adhesion of malignant tumor - derived prostate epithelial cells to human bone marrow stroma , which can also be inhibited by antibodies targeting α 2 β 1 . 35 These results suggest that interaction between tumor cell and bone matrix / stroma through β 1 integrins is critical for tumor cell colonization in the bone . Our studies also examined the roles of talin1 S425 phosphor - ylation in spontaneous lymph node metastasis following ortho - topic implantation of PCa cells . In contrast to the effects of talin1 mutants on bone colonization , lymph node metastases were observed in both cells expressing wild - type and talin1 S425A - expressing PC3 - MM2 cells , which is unable to activate β 1 integrins , although the number of lymph node metastases in talin1 S425A was decreased . Our results agree with a recent study of Barthel et al . 29 who found that β 1 integrins were highly activated in PCa cells derived from bone metastasis , but not in LNCaP variants selected for lymph node metastasis , from which the authors concluded β 1 ( and α v β 3 ) integrins were less important to lymph node metastasis than to bone metastasis . Finally , our studies examine only the role of the β 1 integrin subunit in PCa progression . Several integrins , including α 5 β 1 , α 2 β 1 and α v β 3 integrins have functional consequences for PCa metastasis . The β 1 and β 3 subunits have both been implicated in increased migration , 29 , 33 – 38 suggesting overlapping functions among activated integrins . The α subunits of integrins also likely have distinct but overlapping roles in PCa metastasis . Recently , the α 5 subunit , but not other α subunits has been implicated in insulin - like growth factor - 1R - mediated cell growth . 39 Increased expression of α 6 integrin leads to more invasive tumors in mice . 40 Further studies on roles of microenvironment in integrin expres - sion , activation and altered heterodimerization will be required to discern roles of speci ﬁ c heterodimers . In summary , we demonstrated the importance of phosphoryla - tion of talin in β 1 integrin activation . We further identi ﬁ ed a novel mechanism for β 1 integrin activation through p35 - Cdk5 - mediated talin1 S425 phosphorylation in metastatic PCa cells , suggesting that talin1 as well as Cdk5 may be potential targets for development of novel inhibitors of PCa bone metastasis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines , culture conditions and antibodies The PC3 and PC3 - MM2 cells were gifts from Dr Isaiah J Fidler at the M . D . Anderson Cancer Center . The PC3 - MM2 is a highly metastatic cell line derived following two passages of PC3 - M cells in nude mice of selecting and repassaging lymph node metastases . 41 LNCaP cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection . The C4 - 2B4 cells are a LNCaP variant derived from a mouse bone metastasis . 42 All cell lines were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute - 1640 medium supplemen - ted with 10 % fetal bovine serum , checked every 6 months and found to be mycoplasma free , and authenticated at the M .

Fluorescence - labeled cells were lysed by 1 % Triton X - 100 , and the ﬂ uorescence intensity was measured using an Envision plate reader ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Migration and invasion assays Migration assays were performed using collagen I - coated polycarbonate transwell membranes in 24 - well plates ( 8 - μ m pore size ; Corning , Tewksbury , MA , USA ) as described previously . 44 For invasion assays , Matrigel - coated ﬁ lters ( BD Biosciences ) were used . The medium in the bottom chamber was supplemented with 0 . 1 % fetal bovine serum as a chemoattractant . Cells were allowed to migrate for 8h or invade for 24h . Images of ﬁ lters were acquired using a microscope with camera ( Eclipse Ti - S ; Nikon , Melville , NY , USA ) .
