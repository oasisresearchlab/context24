Words ( but not Tones ) Facilitate Object Categorization : Evidence From 6 - and 12 - Month - Olds Anne L . Fulkerson 1 and Sandra R . Waxman 2 1 The University of Toledo 2 Northwestern University Abstract Recent studies reveal that naming has powerful conceptual consequences within the first year of life . Naming distinct objects with the same word highlights commonalities among the objects and promotes object categorization . In the present experiment , we pursued the origin of this link by examining the influence of words and tones on object categorization in infants at 6 and 12 months . At both ages , infants hearing a novel word for a set of distinct objects successfully formed object categories ; those hearing a sequence of tones for the same objects did not . These results support the view that infants are sensitive to powerful and increasingly nuanced links between linguistic and conceptual units very early in the process of lexical acquisition . Keywords Infancy ; Categorization ; Object Naming Questions concerning the relation between linguistic and conceptual organization have long occupied a central position in the cognitive sciences . Recently , considerable attention has been devoted to discovering the origin of this relation in infants and toddlers . Research in this arena has focused primarily on early word - learning . This is an apt focus because at its core , learning a word involves establishing a relation between a linguistic unit ( the word ) and a conceptual unit ( the concept to which the word refers ) . The key developmental question is when words begin to carry conceptual force , and how early in the process of word - learning they begin to influence infants’ representations of individual objects and the relations among them ( Balaban & Waxman , 1997 ; Booth & Waxman , 2003 ; Fulkerson & Haaf , 2003 ; Namy , 2001 ; Namy & Waxman , 1998 ; Roberts & Jacob , 1991 ; Waxman & Booth , 2003 ; Waxman & Braun , 2005 ; Waxman & Markow , 1995 ; Woodward & Hoyne , 1999 ; Xu , 1999 , 2002 ) . There is now robust evidence that words and conceptual organization are linked within the first year of life . Even at 9 to 12 months of age , when infants have just begun to produce their first words , naming has powerful conceptual consequences . Applying the same name to distinct objects ( e . g . , four different animals ) highlights commonalities among the objects and supports infants’ formation of an inclusive category ( e . g . , animal ) . This phenomenon was first documented in 12 - month - olds using a novelty - preference task ( Waxman & Braun , 2005 ; Waxman & Markow , 1995 ) . Infants were familiarized to four different category exemplars ( e . g . , four animals ) in conjunction with infant - directed speech . In the experimental conditions , an experimenter introduced these using a novel name ( e . g . , “See the fauna ? ” ) ; in the No Word Publisher ' s Disclaimer : This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t control condition , she introduced no novel words ( e . g . , “See here ? ” ) . At test , the experimenter introduced a new object from the now - familiar category ( e . g . , another animal ) and an object from a novel category ( e . g . , a vehicle ) , saying , “See what I have ? ” The results reveal a powerful effect of naming on object categorization . Infants hearing novel words successfully formed categories , as witnessed by their reliable preference for the novel test object ; those in the No Word control condition did not . Moreover , recent evidence reveals that by the close of the first year , naming supports the acquisition of novel categories comprised of entirely novel objects ( Booth & Waxman , 2002 ; Fulkerson & Haaf , 1998 , in press ) and also promotes the strength of object categories as an inductive base ( Graham , Kilbreath , & Welder , 2004 ; Welder & Graham , 2001 , 2006 ) . Additional research has considered whether the effect of naming on infants’ categorization stems specifically from the presentation of novel words , or is the consequence of a more general , attention - engaging function associated with auditory stimuli . To address this issue , researchers have compared the effects of novel words vs . non - linguistic stimuli on infant categorization . For example , Balaban and Waxman ( 1997 ) compared the influence of novel words vs . novel tone sequences on 9 - month - olds’ object categorization . Infants viewed a series of pictures representing one object category ( e . g . , rabbits ) in conjunction with an auditory stimulus that emanated from a hidden speaker . In the Word condition , this stimulus was a naming phrase ( e . g . , “a rabbit” ) . In the Tone condition , this stimulus was a sine - wave tone ( matched to the naming phrase in amplitude , duration and pause length ) . Infants in the Word condition successfully formed object categories ; those hearing tones did not . Subsequent work with a broader range of stimuli has extended this finding : words ( including content - filtered words ) promoted successful categorization , but non - linguistic sounds ( including tones , melodies , mechanical sounds , and even mouth sounds ) failed to do so ( Balaban & Waxman , 1997 ; Fulkerson and Haaf , 2003 ; Woodward & Hoyne , 1999 ) . Together , these results suggest that a link between words and concepts is in place quite early . As soon as infants say their first words , there is something special about words : they interpret words , but not other non - linguistic sounds , as inherently connected to meaning . What remains unclear , however , is the origin of this link ( Waxman , 1998 ; Waxman & Lidz , 2006 ) . We know that newborns are especially attuned to human speech ( Vouloumanos & Werker , 2004 ) , but this leaves open the question of when infants begin to interpret words as relevant to meaning . Might such a link be available when infants first begin to identify words reliably from the speech stream ? And if so , is this early link specific to words , or does it emerge from a more general attention - engaging function associated with auditory stimuli ? We designed the current experiment to address these questions , adapting the novelty - preference paradigm to compare the influence of words and tone sequences on object categorization in infants at two strategically - selected ages . We opened our developmental window at 6 months . There are several indications that this is the point at which infants are poised to make their first forays into mapping words to meaning . In particular , they reliably distinguish open - class ( content ) from closed - class ( function ) words , and prefer listening to the former ( Gomez , 2002 ; Shi & Werker , 2003 ) ; they are able to reliably identify some familiar content words within fluent speech ( Mandel - Emer , 1997 ) ; and they begin to map a small set of content words ( e . g . , ‘mommy’ , ‘daddy’ ) , to their referents ( Tincoff & Jusczyk , 1999 ) . At the same time , infants at 6 months are far from proficient in word - learning . There are several essential developmental milestones not yet in their repertoires . Notably , it is not until 7 months that infants’ begin to babble the speech sounds characteristic of their ambient language ( Oller , 1980 ; Oller & Lynch , 1992 ) . Moreover , it is not until 8 months that infants come to recognize the stress patterns typical of words in their ambient language ( Houston , Jusczyk , Kuijpers , Coolen , & Cutler , 2000 ; Johnson & Jusczyk , 2001 ) ; it is not until 9 months that they come to Fulkerson and Waxman Page 2 Cognition .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t recognize phonemic categories that are specific to their ambient language ( Cheour et al . , 1998 ; Werker & Lalonde , 1988 ; Werker & Tees , 1984 ) ; and it is not until 14 months that they are able to recruit their sensitivity to phonemic contrasts ( e . g . , ‘bin’ vs ‘din’ ) as they map words to meaning ( Fennell & Waxman , 2006 ; Werker , Fennell , Corcoran & Stager , 2002 ) . It is therefore an open question whether infants at this developmental juncture would interpret novel words as inherently connected to meaning and reference . We also included infants at 12 months to anchor the results of the current paradigm with infants for whom the link between words and concepts has been robustly demonstrated ( Fulkerson & Haaf , 1998 ; in press ; Waxman & Braun , 2005 ; Waxman & Markow , 1995 ) . Based on previous work , our predictions for 12 - month - olds were clear : novel words ( but not tone sequences ) should support the establishment of object categories ( Balaban & Waxman , 1997 ; Waxman & Markow , 1995 ; Fulkerson & Haaf , 1998 , 2003 , in press ) . At issue is the performance of the 6 - month - olds . One possibility is that for these young infants , words and tones will carry the same force . If this is the case , then infants should perform comparably in the context of words and tones ( either successfully establishing object categories , or failing to do so ) . But it is also possible that infants at this developmental juncture are already sensitive to the distinct conceptual force of words . If this is the case , then infants hearing words ( but not those hearing tones ) will successfully form object categories . Method Participants Participants included 64 six - month - olds ( 25 female ) averaging 185 . 0 days in age ( SD = 7 . 0 ) and 64 twelve - month - olds ( 38 female ) averaging 364 . 0 days in age ( SD = 14 . 5 ) . Infants were recruited from county birth records and were predominantly from white , middle - class families . All participating infants were full - term , healthy , and acquiring English as their native language . Eleven additional infants were excluded : equipment failure ( 4 ) , parental / sibling interference ( 2 ) , fussiness ( 2 ) , experimenter error ( 1 ) , obstructed view of infant ( 2 ) . Stimuli Visual stimuli— Twenty slides of line - drawn dinosaurs and fish were produced to form two familiarization sets of eight stimuli each and two test sets of two stimuli each ( see Figure 1 ) . Within each familiarization set , stimuli varied in color ; within each test set , stimuli were matched in color . Stimuli were outlined in black , filled with a solid color , and projected to an average angular size of 13 . 3 by 9 . 0 degrees onto a white screen . Auditory stimuli— Auditory stimuli included two sets of naming phrases ( “Oh look , it’s a toma / modi . Do you see the toma / modi ? ” ) and two sequences of pure tones ( 400 Hz , 800 Hz ) . Naming phrases were spoken by a female in the infant - directed speech register and recorded for presentation . Tone sequences were created to match the naming phrases in timing , duration ( 3 . 4 s ) , and volume ( 92 dB ) . Apparatus Infants sat on a parent’s lap in a gray three - sided booth . One wall of the booth contained two 18 by 18 cm screens ( with 12 cm of separation ) centered 61 cm from infants’ eye level . Visual stimuli were displayed via slide projector . Auditory stimuli were presented through a speaker hidden 58 cm below the midpoint of the screens . Infants were videotaped through a 6 cm hole located 11 cm below the projection screens .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Procedure Each infant participated in a novelty - preference task that included a familiarization phase and a test phase ( see Figure 1 ) . Parents were blind to the hypotheses and were instructed not to influence their infant’s attention in any way . Familiarization phase— Infants were presented with eight different exemplars from the same category ( e . g . , dinosaurs ) , one at a time , in random order , for 20 s each . The lateral position of the stimulus was determined randomly on the first trial and alternated thereafter . Half the infants at each age were randomly assigned to the Word or Tone condition . In the Word condition , infants heard a naming phrase as they viewed the stimuli ; in the Tone condition , infants heard a sequence of pure tones . In both conditions , the auditory stimulus was introduced during the first 4 s of each trial and once again approximately 3 s later . Stimulus set and auditory stimulus were counterbalanced . Test phase— In both conditions infants viewed two stimuli : a new exemplar from the now - familiar category ( e . g . , another dinosaur ) and an exemplar from a novel category ( e . g . , a fish ) . These were presented side - by - side in silence . The test phase began with infants’ first visual fixation to one of the stimuli and lasted 10 s . Test stimulus set and the lateral position of the stimuli were counterbalanced . Coding— A trained observer , blind to the hypotheses and condition assignment , coded infants’ visual fixations . Twenty - five percent of infants in each age and condition were re - coded by an independent observer . Reliability between observers was r = . 96 during familiarization and r = . 88 during test . Results Familiarization Phase We submitted infants’ total accumulated looking time during familiarization to an Age x Condition ANOVA . A significant effect of Age , F ( 1 , 124 ) = 31 . 67 , p < . 001 , prep = . 997 , d = . 99 , revealed that 12 - month - olds ( M = 115 . 6 s , SD = 18 . 1 s ) accumulated more looking than did 6 - month - olds ( M = 93 . 8 s , SD = 26 . 0 s ) . In addition , the Age x Condition interaction was significant , F ( 1 , 124 ) = 7 . 66 , p = . 007 , prep = . 959 , d = . 49 , indicating that with age , infants showed more interest in objects presented with words than objects presented with tones . Test Phase To measure categorization , we calculated a novelty - preference score for each infant , dividing looking to the novel - category exemplar by total looking . If infants formed a category , then they should reveal a novelty - preference score greater than chance ( . 50 ) . We therefore compared performance in each age group and condition to this level of responding . As predicted , 12 - month - olds in the Word condition demonstrated a reliable novelty - preference , ( M = . 59 , SD = . 18 ) , t ( 31 ) = 2 . 89 , p = . 007 , two - tailed , prep = . 959 , d = 1 . 02 , but those in the Tone condition performed at chance , ( M = . 53 , SD = . 14 ) , t ( 31 ) = 1 . 32 , p = . 20 , prep = . 724 , d = . 47 . Remarkably , 6 - month - olds demonstrated the same effect . Infants in the Word condition demonstrated a reliable novelty - preference ( M = . 63 , SD = . 19 ; t ( 31 ) = 3 . 95 , p < . 001 , prep = 1 . 00 , d = 1 . 40 , but those in the Tone condition performed at chance ( M = . 54 , SD = . 20 ; t ( 31 ) = 1 . 05 , p = . 30 , prep = . 645 , d = . 38 . We next submitted infants’ novelty - preference scores to an Age x Condition ANOVA . A significant effect of Condition , F ( 1 , 128 ) = 5 . 92 , p = . 016 , prep = . 935 , d = . 43 , revealed that infants in the Word condition ( M = . 61 , SD = . 19 ) showed reliably higher novelty - preference Fulkerson and Waxman Page 4 Cognition .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t scores than did infants in the Tone condition ( M = . 54 , SD = . 17 ) . There were no other main effects or interactions ( p s > . 45 ) . Thus , at both 6 - and 12 - months of age , words served as a more powerful impetus than tones in the establishment of object categories . A subsequent analysis of individual infants’ performance provides additional evidence that by 6 months , novel words have conceptual consequences that are not observed with tone sequences . We tabulated the number of infants in each age and condition with novelty - preference scores above . 50 . We then used the binomial probability distribution to determine whether this number differed from chance expectations ( 16 of 32 infants ) . At 12 months , 24 infants in the Word condition revealed a novelty - preference ( p = . 007 , two - tailed ) ; only 17 did so in the Tone condition ( p = . 86 ) . At 6 months , 25 infants in the Word condition exhibited a novelty - preference ( p = . 002 ) ; only 20 did so in the Tone condition ( p = . 22 ) . This suggests that results of the main parametric analyses reflect tendencies that are characteristic of most individuals . At both 6 - and 12 - months of age , words , but not tones , support the establishment of object categories . Discussion Previous work has documented that by the time infants begin to produce their first words , they are sensitive to a link between words and the concepts to which they refer . Present results reveal that infants are sensitive to this link as early as 6 months and suggest that this sensitivity is tied specifically to words , rather than to general attention - engaging properties associated with sound . To the best of our knowledge , this constitutes the earliest documentation to date of a link between linguistic units ( words ) and conceptual units ( object categories ) , and suggests that this link is available to guide infants’ earliest efforts to map words to meaning . These results provide insight into the capacities of infants as they enter the process of word - learning . Characterizing these capacities has been the focus of considerable recent debate . Some have argued that early word - learning is the product of a general associative mechanism , that infants’ first words are acquired without the benefit of any guiding expectations , and that it is only after infants have gained a substantial productive lexicon that they become sensitive to links between linguistic and conceptual units ( Roberts , 1997 ; Smith , 1999 ; Smith , Colunga & Yoshida , 2003 ) . Others have argued that words hinder infants’ ability to form categories ( Robinson & Sloutsky , in press ; Gogate & Bahrick , 2001 ; Gogate , Bahrick , & Watson , 2000 ) . We have argued for a very different view , asserting that infants are guided from the start by powerful and increasingly nuanced links between linguistic , conceptual , and perceptual units ( Balaban & Waxman , 1997 ; Booth & Waxman , 2003 ; Fulkerson & Haaf , 1998 , 2003 , in press ; Gopnik & Nazzi , 2003 ; Graham , Baker & Poulin - Dubois , 1998 ; Waxman & Braun , 2005 ; Waxman & Lidz , 2006 ; Waxman & Markow , 1995 ; Xu , 2002 ) . The current results favor this latter interpretation . They accord well with the view that there is indeed something special about words in the first year of life , and they challenge seriously the claim that infants enter the process of word - learning as tabulae rasae , with no links between linguistic units ( e . g . , words ) and conceptual units ( e . g . , object categories ) to guide acquisition . The current results represent a first step toward characterizing the relation between words and concepts in infants on the threshold of word - learning . They also open the door for further investigation . In particular , it will be crucial to examine infants’ responses to a broader range of stimuli , both linguistic and non - linguistic . Evidence is mounting that infants actually coordinate several kinds of cues in the service of establishing word meaning ( Hall & Waxman , 2004 ; Hollich , Hirsh - Pasek , & Golinkoff , 2000 ; Roberts , 1995 ) . For example , even non - linguistic elements such as whistles and brief melodic bursts may be interpreted as ‘names for Fulkerson and Waxman Page 5 Cognition .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t things’ when an experimenter makes it clear that her intention is to treat these stimuli as object names ( Campbell & Namy , 2003 ; Fulkerson & Haaf , 2003 ; Hollich et al . , 2000 ; Namy , 2001 ; Namy & Waxman , 1998 ; Woodward & Hoyne , 1999 ) . Importantly , when strong interpersonal cues to naming are stripped away , non - linguistic stimuli have no such effect ( Balaban & Waxman , 1997 ; Fulkerson & Haaf , 2003 ) . However , these findings highlight the need to identify the relevant linguistic and non - linguistic cues brought to bear in the service of word - learning and to ascertain how infants recruit these cues in mapping words to meaning . It will also be important to detail with greater precision which properties of linguistic stimuli provide them their conceptual force in the first year of life . We suspect that the influence initially reflects infants’ sensitivity to infant - directed speech and to content words and that a sensitivity to more specific syntactic and semantic properties follows . From birth , infants are exquisitely attuned to human speech ( Molfese , Freeman , & Polermo , 1975 ; Vouloumanos & Werker , 2004 ) , and are especially attracted to the heightened pitch and exaggerated intonational contours of infant - directed speech ( Cooper & Aslin , 1990 ; Fernald , 1992 ; Fernald , Taeschner , Dun , Papousek , de Boysson - Bardies , & Fukui , 1989 ) . During the first six months , infant - directed speech primarily engages and modulates attention ( Fernald , 1992 ; Kaplan , Goldstein , Huckeby , Owren , & Cooper , 1995 ) . However , in the second six months , “words begin to emerge from the melody” ( Fernald , 1992 , p . 403 ) as infants start to parse content words from the ongoing speech stream and to show a preference for content words over function words ( Mandel - Emer , 1997 ; Shi & Werker , 2003 ) . By their second year , infants show even greater differentiation as they begin to distinguish between more specific grammatical forms ( such as nouns and adjectives ) and link them to different kinds of meaning ( object categories and object properties , respectively ) ( Booth & Waxman , 2003 ; Waxman & Booth , 2001 , 2003 ) . In sum , the current results reveal that a link between linguistic and conceptual units is available early enough to guide infants’ first steps in word - learning . To characterize this link with greater precision , it will be critical to examine infants’ sensitivity to various properties of the speech signal , including acoustic , syntactic , semantic , and pragmatic properties of words , as they unfold over development and as they relate to meaning .
