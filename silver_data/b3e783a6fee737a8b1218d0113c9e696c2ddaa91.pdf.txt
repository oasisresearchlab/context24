Fish epidermal keratocytes that rapidly repair wounds comprise a frontal crescent - shaped lamellipodium and a rear rugby ball - shaped cell body . The cell body rotates like a wheel during migration . Stress fibers , which are bundles of contractile actomyosin filaments , are arranged along the seams of the rugby ball . Here we show the linear contraction of stress fibers to be the driving force for rotation . We constructed a mechanical model of the cell body that consisted of a soft cylinder with a contractile coil . From the motion of the model , it was predicted that contraction of the stress fibers would deform the soft cell body , as a result of which the deformed cell body would push against the substrate to generate torque . This prediction was confirmed by the observation of stress fiber dynamics in migrating cells . Linear - to - rotation conversion in migrating keratocytes is realized by simple soft - body mechanics . Conversion from linear motion to rotation is widely used in machines with moving parts , but requires somewhat complicated mechanics . An understanding of linear - to - rotation conversion in keratocytes has potential for use in the design of biomimetic soft robots . 2 / 27 Introduction Throughout the organismal life cycle , crawling cell migration plays an essential role in a variety of biological phenomena , including development 1 , wound healing 2 , immune function 3 , and cancer metastasis 4 . Wounds are healed by migration of surrounding epidermal cells to the injured area . The wound healing rate of fish skin is known to reach 500 µm / h 5 , about 50 times faster than in human skin 6 . The crawling migration of fish epidermal keratocytes 7 – 9 plays the main role in fast wound repair . A single keratocyte shows fast migration while maintaining its characteristic shape that consists of a frontal crescent - shaped lamellipodium and a rear rugby ball - shaped cell body 10 – 12 . At the leading edge of the lamellipodium , actin polymerization pushes the front 13 – 15 , whereas in the cell body , stress fibers composed of actomyosin are positioned to connect the left and right focal adhesions 16 – 19 . Contraction of the stress fibers retracts the rear 14 , 16 , 20 . However , the direction of the contractile forces is almost perpendicular to the direction of migration 13 , 20 – 23 , suggesting that the stress fibers play another role in cell advance . Several investigators 14 , 24 have reported that the cell bodies rotate in migrating keratocytes . Anderson et al . ( 1996 ) showed that cell membrane and nucleus also rotate , based on their observations of fluorescent beads in the inner part of the membrane and autofluorescence of the nucleus 24 . We also recently showed that multiple stress fibers , arranged like the seams of a rugby ball around the nucleus , rotate 25 . Ablation of some of the stress fibers induced the collapse of the left - right balance of the migrating cell . Rotation of the cell body , including stress fibers , appears to play an important role , at least in steering the cell while migrating . If rotation of the cell body contributes to cell migration in the manner of a wheel , how it rotates is an interesting question . Anderson et al . ( 1996 ) observed that the translocation of the cell body continued after the arrest of lamellipodial protrusions by cytochalasin B 24 . We also observed that the stress fibers continued to rotate even after cutting off the leading edge of a migrating keratocyte 25 . These facts indicate that the cell body rotates autonomously , rather than passively by pseudopod extension . Stress fibers are molecular machines that contract linearly like myofibrils 26 – 28 . We speculate that their linear contraction drives the rotation of the cell body , and that their linear motion is converted to rotation by as yet unknown mechanics . The construction of mechanical models that reproduce certain behaviors is a powerful technique for elucidating the mechanics of certain biological phenomena . For example , Nonaka et al . ( 2005 ) demonstrated , using a mechanical model composed of a rotating tilted wire that mimics a cilium 29 , that the cause of the nodal flow that creates left - right asymmetry in mice is the tilt of the cilia , which create a stream of viscous fluid . In this study , we first confirmed that the rotation of stress fibers is accompanied by the slower rotation of the membrane and nucleus , suggesting that the stress fibers cause the rotation . We also constructed a mechanical model that mimics a keratocyte cell body using a soft silicone gel and a contractile coil . From a motion analysis of our mechanical model , a torque generation principle 3 / 27 was posited : that the cell body , when deformed by stress fiber contraction , would push against the substrate . This prediction was confirmed by live cell imaging . Keratocytes use the elasticity of their cell body to achieve the conversion of linear motion into rotation . 4 / 27 Results Rotation of the nucleus and stress fibers in a migrating keratocyte In the rugby ball - shaped cell body of a migrating keratocyte ( Fig . 1A and Supplementary Video 1 ) , multiple stress fibers are arranged along the seams of the rugby ball around the nucleus ( Fig . 1B ) 25 . We first confirmed the rotation of the nucleus using sequential three - dimensional ( 3D ) recordings ( Supplementary Video 2 ) , as Anderson et al . ( 1996 ) reported . A time series of top and bottom optical sections of the nucleus was compiled from sequential 3D images ( Fig . 1C - F ) . Fluorescent spots of GFP - histone H1A at the top or bottom surfaces of the nucleus moved forward ( Fig . 1D and the blue column in G , Intact ) or rearward ( Fig . 1F and the red column in G , Intact ) , respectively , in the cell frame of reference . Next , to directly compare stress fiber rotation and nuclear rotation , we simultaneously recorded the dynamics of stress fibers and nucleus as sequential 3D images ( Supplementary Video 3 , top and Fig . 1H : snapshot from the images ) . The time series of perpendicular optical sections at the center of the cell ( gray in Fig . 1B ) were constructed from the sequential 3D images ( Fig . 1I , J and Supplementary Video 3 , bottom ) . At the bottom , a stress fiber ( white arrows in Fig . 1I , J and Supplementary Video 3 , bottom ) moved rearward in the cell frame of reference . At the same time , a protrusion from a slightly distorted nucleus ( yellow arrows in Fig . 1I , J and Supplementary Video 3 , bottom ) also moved rearward , dragged by the stress fibers ( 0 - 20 s in Fig . 1I and J ) . The protrusion then detached from the fiber ( 30 s in Fig . 1I and J ) , and the protrusion stopped moving rearward and contracted ( 40 - 50 s in Fig . 1I and J ) . A statistical comparison of the velocities at the bottom of the cell ( Fig . 1K ) also shows that the rearward velocities of nuclei were lower than those of the stress fibers in the cell frame of reference , indicating that the rotation of the nucleus is not the cause of rotation of the stress fibers . Treatment with low concentrations of blebbistatin , an inhibitor of myosin II ATPase , causes the disassembly of stress fibers but does not halt crawling cell migration 7 , 18 , 19 , 25 , 30 . We observed the dynamics of the nucleus in the blebbistatin - treated keratocytes during their migration . The velocities of fluorescent spots of mCherry - histone at both the top and the bottom surfaces significantly decreased in the cell frame of reference ( Fig . 1G , Bleb . ) . These results suggest the rotation of stress fibers to be the driving force of the rotation of the nucleus . However , other possibilities cannot be entirely ruled out , since blebbistatin inhibits not only the polymerization of stress fibers but also other functions related to myosin II ATPase . Rotation of the cell membrane and stress fibers in a migrating keratocyte Stress fibers are located inside the cell body and do not directly contact the extracellular substrate . If the rotation of the stress fibers contributes to cell migration , the cell membrane should also rotate in the same direction , at the same or at a slightly slower speed , in order to transfer the torque of stress fiber - rotation to the substrate . We stained the cell membrane of migrating keratocytes with 5 / 27 Concanavalin A ( Con A ) - Alexa and recorded the dynamics of the bright spots at the top and bottom surface of the cell ( Supplementary Video 4 ) . The Con A spots at the top and bottom of the cell body moved forward and rearward in the cell frame of reference , respectively ( Fig . 2A - D and E , Intact ) . Such movements , however , could not be detected in lamellipodia ( Fig . 2B , Supplementary Video 4 , Bottom ) . These results confirm the rotation of the membrane but not the lamellipodia , as indicated by Anderson et al . ( 1996 ) 24 . To reveal whether rotation of the stress fibers causes membrane rotation or vice versa , we simultaneously recorded the dynamics of the F - actin and membrane at the bottom cell surface ( Supplementary Video 5 ) , and compared their velocities ( Fig . 2F - L ) . During cell advance ( Fig . 2F - H ) , a Con A spot ( Fig . 2J and K , yellow circle ) moved rearward at a somewhat slower speed than a stress fiber ( Fig 2I and K , arrows ) in the cell frame of reference . Statistically , the rearward velocity of Con A spots was slower than that of stress fibers ( Fig . 2L ) , indicating that the membrane rotation is not the cause of stress fiber rotation . The rearward velocity of stress fibers is slower in Fig . 1K than in Fig . 2L . This is probably because after being extracted from a fish , keratocyte migration slows down over time 31 . Figure 2L shows cells one day after removal from the fish body , while Fig . 1K shows cells two days after extraction , kept to wait for the expression of GFP - histone . The migration velocity of the cells in Fig . 1K ( Fig . 2M , SF + N ) was slower than that in Fig . 2L ( Fig . 2M , SF + M ) . Next , we observed the Con A spots at the top and bottom of the cell body of migrating keratocytes whose stress fibers had been disassembled by treatment with low concentrations of blebbistatin . Blebbistatin treatment reduced the velocities of Con A spots at the top and bottom to 34 % and 30 % , respectively , of their original speed ( Fig . 2E , Bleb . ) . These results suggest the rotation of stress fibers to be the driving force for membrane rotation , but possibly not the only driving force . Reproduction of the cell body rotation using a mechanical model To test whether linear dynamics like stress fiber contraction can be converted into the rotation of the cell body , we constructed a mechanical model 1 , 500 × in scale ( 4 . 3 gf in weight , Fig . 3A and B ) : A shape memory alloy coil that mimics a stress fiber was embedded in the curved side of a soft cylindrical silicone gel , designed to model a cell body . The model was placed on a horizontal acrylic base plate . The adhesive force between the gel and the plate , measured as the force required to detach them , was 9 . 7 gf / cm 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1A ) . Electric current was applied to the coil , whose resistance was 10 ± 0 . 3 Ω ( SEM ; n = 11 ) using a purpose - built electric power circuit ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) . In response to the application of an electric current of 140 mA ( Fig . 3C ) , the coil contracted in response to Joule heating , causing the gel to deform . The model then rolled forward on its acrylic base plate ( Fig . 3D , E and Supplementary Video 6 ) . The movement characteristics of this model were then investigated in detail . We first clarified the relationship between the position where the coil contacts the gel and the angle of rotation of the gel cylinder ( θ 0 and θ r in Fig . 3F ) . The maximum angle of rotation was obtained by 6 / 27 the coil contraction at a position of 10 - 15º from the vertical . Thus , in the following experiments , the coil was caused to contract at the 15º position . From the time - courses of the contraction ratio of the coil ( Fig . 3G ) , which was defined as the linear distance between the two terminals of the contracted coil divided by the original distance , and the angle of rotation of the gel cylinder ( Fig . 3H ) , a contraction - to - rotation relationship ( Fig . 3I ) was obtained . The correlation coefficient ( r ) between contraction and rotation was 0 . 91 , indicating that contraction of the coil induces rotation of the gel Vehicles must exert traction forces on the substrate to be able to move . The distribution of traction forces depends on the principle of motion of the given vehicle . Comparing the traction force maps exerted by each vehicle is thus a useful technique for comparing the principles of different vehicles . The traction force map exerted by our model ( Fig . 4A and Supplementary Video 7 ) was almost same as that exerted by a migrating keratocyte ( Fig . 4B and Supplementary Video 8 ) . In both cases , traction forces are exerted mainly at the left and right edges toward the center . We constructed another model of a typical vehicle with front wheel drive and a trailing rear wheel ( Fig . 4C ) . The wheels are made not of soft silicone but of hard acrylic , and their diameter and length are the same as our model of a keratocyte cell body ( Fig . 3A and B ) . The traction force map of our model ( Fig . 4A ) was completely different from those of the vehicle model with front wheel drive and a trailing rear wheel ( Fig . 4D , E and Supplementary Video 9 ) . These results suggest that our mechanical model ( Fig . 3A and B ) accurately reproduces the rotation of keratocyte stress fibers and that both rotate according to the same mechanical principles . Rotation of the model is induced by pushing against the substrate To reveal how the model converts coil contraction into rotation of the gel , we accurately evaluated the deformation of the gel . By applying lime powder to the gel surface , the adhesive force of the gel was reduced to close to zero . Four glass rods were placed on the substrate parallel to the contraction direction of the coil without attaching them , and the model was placed on them such that θ 0 was 90º ( Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . In this situation , the contraction of the coil induces the deformation of the gel without being restricted by the adhesion of the gel to the substrate , but does not induce rotation of the gel . The images of the model before and after the coil contraction ( Supplementary Fig . 2B and C ) were taken from directly above ( arrow in Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . From the images , the displacement of the centroid of the gel ( l in Supplementary Fig . 2D ) was calculated using the following formula . 𝑙 = 1 𝐿 % { −𝑎𝑥 ! + 𝑎 ( 𝐿 / 2 ) ! } " / ! $ " / ! 𝑑𝑥 The centerline ( blue line in Supplementary Fig . 2D ) was approximated as a quadratic function . The term a is the constant of the function . The displacement of the centroid of the gel was proportional to the ratio of the coil contraction ( Supplementary Fig . 2E ) . Since the maximum contraction ratio of the 7 / 27 migrating mechanical model was about 20 % ( Fig . 3G ) , from the graph , we estimated the maximum displacement of the centroid to be 1 . 4 mm ( Supplementary Fig . 2E ) . From these results , we considered two possibilities as the cause of the model’s rotation ; ( 1 ) displacement of the centroid and / or ( 2 ) pushing against the substrate caused by deformation of the gel . First , we tested the former possibility . From the 1 . 4 - mm displacement of the centroid , it was calculated that when the substrate is tilted 2 . 5º ( ψ in Supplementary Fig . 2F ) , the center of gravity of the new centroid position moves toward the grounding point of the gel . In this situation , the displacement of the centroid should not affect the rotation . We then observed whether or not the model would rotate on a substrate tilted by 2 . 5º ( Fig . 5A ) . Coil contraction occurred normally ( Fig . 5B ) . Rotation of the gel also occurred ( Fig . 5C and D ) as it did on the horizontal substrate ( Fig . 3H and I ) . The correlation coefficient ( r ) between contraction and rotation was 0 . 95 , indicating that displacement of the centroid does not contribute in any way to the rotation . Then , to test the second possibility , we placed our model at the edge of the substrate ( Fig . 5E ) . In this situation , the pushing force ( blue arrow in Fig . 5E ) cannot transmit to the substrate . The coil contraction began normally ( Fig . 5F ) . However , the gel fell from the edge instead of rotating ( Fig . 5G and H ) , suggesting that pushing against the substrate is the cause of the rotation . We then tested whether the gel would always push against the substrate . The mechanical model was placed on a soft elastic substrate that had a Young’s modulus of 5 . 1 kPa ( Fig . 5I ) . The height of the space where the mechanical model could move was limited to 14 mm , identical to the diameter of the gel , using an acrylic plate . On contraction of the coil , the gel deformed and the substrate showed indentations just below both ends of the gel ( Fig . 5J - O , Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Video 10 ) . The depth and the radius of the indentations were 0 . 187 ± 0 . 0367 mm ( n = 6 ) and 1 . 73 ± 113 mm ( n = 6 ) , respectively . From those values , the force pushing against the substrate is calculated to be 0 . 96 mN ( = 98 mgf ) . These results indicate that our mechanical model generates the torque for its rotation from coil contraction by pushing against the substrate rather than via displacement of the centroid . Keratocyte cell bodies push against the substrate to effect rotation The similarity of the traction force distribution between our mechanical model ( Fig . 4A ) and keratocytes ( Fig . 4B ) suggests that the rotation of the cell body in keratocytes is realized via the same mechanics as that of our model . It is essential for rotation for our model to push against the substrate as a result of its deformation ( Fig . 5 ) . We dispersed keratocytes on a soft substrate with a Young’s modulus of 0 . 1 kPa . The height of the space in which the cells could move was limited to 8 / 27 the same height as the cell , by covering them with an agar sheet ( Fig . 6A ) . Under these conditions , the stress fibers did not rotate ( Fig . 6B and Supplementary Video 11 ) , and the indentations in the substrate were detected at the left and right ends of the cell body just before the cell body passed by ( Fig . 6C , red and yellow squares , D , Left and Right , and Supplementary Video 12 ) . The depth of the indentations was 225 ± 0 . 0125 nm ( n = 5 ) . From that value , the force pushing against the substrate is calculated to be 32 ± 2 . 6 pN ( n = 5 ) . On the other hand , since the cells were covered with an agarose sheet , the substrate just below the middle part of the cell body showed indentations due to the volume effect the entire time the cell body was on the area ( Fig . 6C , blue squares , D , Middle , and Supplementary Video 12 ) . These results suggest that the cell body rotation of keratocyte requires pushing forces against the substrate at the both ends of the cell body , created by contraction of the stress fibers . 9 / 27 Discussion Numerous studies that combine mathematical modeling and biological experiments have revealed various biological phenomena 12 , 32 – 39 . These studies have a common and powerful strategy , i . e . , mathematical model predictions that were confirmed by biological experimentation . We adopted the same approach in this study , using a mechanical model rather than a mathematical model . By combining mechanical modeling and biological experiments , we elucidated how stress fiber contractions are converted to cell body rotation ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Our mechanical model predicted that the cell body would rotate by pushing against the substrate ( Fig . 5 and Supplementary Video 10 ) ; then , as predicted , contraction of the stress fibers created indentations in the soft substrate just below both ends of the fibers ( Fig . 6C , D and Supplementary Video 12 ) , with no rotation of the stress fibers being observed ( Fig . 6B and Supplementary Video 11 ) . It is difficult to elucidate the mechanics by which the linear contraction of stress fibers is converted into rotational motion by means of biological experiments alone . Combining not only mathematical but also mechanical models with biological experiments is also useful . The forces involved in cell migration such as leading - edge elongation are on the order of several nN 40 . The force of the cell body pushing against the substrate was only 32 pN . The force of the mechanical model pushing against the substrate ( 98 mgf ) is also only 2 . 3 % of its weight ( 4 . 3 gf ) , suggesting that strong forces are not necessary for this type of rotation . Conversion from linear motion to rotation is used in many machines . For example , internal combustion engines that deliver rotational motion from the linear motion of pistons have a history of more than 100 years . The engine is made of rigid materials such as pistons , connecting rods , and a crankshaft . All of these complicated parts are needed to convert the linear motion of the pistons to the rotation of the crankshaft . Our mechanical model showed that linear contraction motion can be converted to rotational motion using only a contractile coil and a soft cylinder . This is a much simpler design than is used in existing machines . It appears that keratocytes have achieved a simple conversion strategy that uses their own flexibility , which is a characteristic of living organisms . Wounds are healed by the natural migration of surrounding epidermal cells to the injured area . Learning from this unique migration mechanism seen in fish keratocytes has the potential to lead to innovations in human wound healing therapy . ‘Soft robots’ that apply flexible features such as seen in living organisms to machines are a new concept that has attracted attention in recent years 41 – 44 . Our mechanical model not only elucidates the biological conversion mechanics from linear to rotational motion , but is also directly linked to biomimetics . In the near future , it may be possible to create a practical machine that converts contractile motion into rotational motion using simple mechanics consisting of multiple contractile fibers and a soft cylinder . 10 / 27 Methods Cell culture Primary cultures of keratocytes prepared from the scales of Central American cichlids ( Hypsophrys nicaraguensis ) as previously described 25 were used throughout this study . Briefly , without sacrificing the fish , a few of their scales were removed and washed in culture medium ( Leibovitz’s medium : L - 15 , L5520 : Sigma - Aldrich supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Nichirei ) and antibiotic / antimycotic solution ( 09366 - 44 : Nacalai Tesque ) . The scales were placed external side up on the floor of a square chamber ( 18 × 18 mm and 2 mm in depth ) , the bottom of which was made of a 24 × 24 mm coverslip ( No . 1 , Matsunami ) . They were then covered with another small coverslip and allowed to adhere to the bottom coverslip for 1 h at 23 ˚C . Culture medium was then added to the chamber . After removal of the upper coverslip , the scales were kept at 23 ˚C again overnight to allow the keratocytes to spread from the scale . Cells were treated with 0 . 5 g / L trypsin and 0 . 53 mM EDTA ( trypsin - EDTA , 32778 - 34 : Nacalai Tesque ) for 30 - 60 s to separate any cell - cell adhesions . All experiments were carried out in accordance with national guidelines and approved by Yamaguchi University Animal Use Committee . Transient transfection of keratocytes with eGFP - or mCherry - histone H1A construct Polyethylene glycol ( 28254 - 85 ; Nacalai Tesque ) was dissolved at 10 mM in Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS + + ) . This PEG medium was then added to the chamber , to the bottom of which the cells had adhered , immediately after removal of the culture medium ( Leibovitz’s medium : L - 15 , 21083 - 027 : Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Nichirei ) and antibiotic / antimycotic solution ( 09366 - 44 : Nacalai Tesque ) . After 10 min , the PEG medium in the chamber was carefully replaced with PBS + + without PEG . Then , 4 µl of 1 . 3 µg / µl eGFP - histone H1A or 1 . 5 µg / µl mCherry - histone H1A in Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS - - ) was applied to the cuvette of a purpose - built electroporator and was directly embedded in the migrating keratocytes as described previously 45 . Next , the medium in the chamber was replaced with the culture medium . The keratocyte cultures were then left overnight to allow expression of eGFP - or mCherry - histone H1A . Staining of actin filaments in live keratocytes Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( A12379 : Life Technologies ) in PBS + + or Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin ( A22283 : Life Technologies ) in PBS + + were introduced into the migrating keratocytes using the purpose - built electroporator 45 . SPY555 ( CY - SC202 : Spirochrome ) was used in some experiments ( Fig . 6B ) . It was dissolved in 50 µl DMSO , and diluted 1 : 500 in culture medium . This SPY555 11 / 27 medium was then added to the chamber , to the bottom of which the cells had adhered , just after removal of the culture medium . The chamber was kept at 37 ºC . After 30 min , the SPY555 medium in the chamber was carefully replaced with the culture medium . The cells were then allowed to recover for about 5 min before observation . Staining of the membrane in live keratocytes Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate of Con A ( C11252 : Thermo Fisher ) was dissolved at 50 µg / ml in culture medium . This Con A - Alexa medium was then added to the chamber , to the bottom of which the cells had adhered , immediately after removal of the culture medium . After 10 min , the Con A - Alexa medium in the chamber was carefully replaced with the culture medium . The cells were then allowed about 5 min to recover before observation . Blebbistatin treatment Blebbistatin treatment was performed as previously described 7 , 25 . Briefly , ( ± ) - Blebbistatin ( 13186 ; Cayman ) was dissolved at 100 mM in DMSO and then diluted 2 , 000 times with culture medium to a final concentration of 50 µM . This blebbistatin medium was then added to the chamber , to the bottom of which the cells had adhered , immediately after removal of the culture medium . After 30 min , the cells in the chamber were used for experiments without removal of the blebbistatin medium . Microscopy The migrating keratocytes were observed using an inverted microscope ( Ti ; Nikon ) equipped with a laser confocal scanner unit ( CSU - X1 ; Yokogawa ) and a high - speed z - axis scanner ( NZ100CE , Prior ) through a 100 × objective lens ( CFI Apo TIRF 100 × H / 1 . 49 : Nikon ) . The fluorescence images were detected using an EM CCD camera ( DU897 ; Andor ) . About 40 slices of the optical sections were recorded at 0 . 5 - µm intervals to construct a 3D cell image . The time interval for recording each optical section was 56 msec . The consecutive images of each optical section were reconstructed into 3D images using FluoRender ( SCI , Univ . of Utah ) . The image data were analyzed using Fiji ( https : / / fiji . sc ) . Construction of mechanical model A mechanical model ( Fig . 3A and B ) which mimics the keratocyte’s cell body containing stress fibers was made as follows . The main body was made from a type of PDMS ( CY52 - 276A and B , Dow Corning Toray ) . A mixture of CY52 - 276A and B at a weight ratio of 7 : 10 was poured into a 12 / 27 cylindrical polypropylene mold ( 14 mm in inner diameter and 30 mm long ) and allowed to solidify at room temperature ( 25 ˚C ) for two days . Before solidification , a 20 - mm long coiled shape - memory alloy ( SMA ; BMX150 , Toki Corp . ) was extended to 30 mm and embedded in the surface layer of the body in the length direction . The Young’s modulus of the gel was measured using the method of Lo et al . 46 . It was estimated to be 6 . 3 kPa for a mixture ratio of 7 : 10 . In response to the application of electric current to the expanded SMA , it contracts due to the self - generated heat as described elsewhere 47 . Electric current was applied to the coil using a purpose - built electric power circuit ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) . For comparison with the mechanical model , another mobile with a frontal self - propelled wheel and a rear passive wheel was also made . The wheels were made from acrylic plastic . Their diameter and length were the same as the model . The power source of the self - propelled wheel is a motor with low - speed gear ( 70189 , Tamiya ) . Traction force measurements Traction forces of migrating keratocytes were measured as previously described 13 , 48 with minor modifications . Briefly , CY52 - 276A and B were mixed at a weight ratio of 6 : 10 . A 40 - 45 - mg aliquot of the mixture was spread on a 22 × 22 mm coverslip ( No . 0 , Matsunami ) . After the mixture had solidified at room temperature ( 25 ˚C ) for two days , the substrates were kept in a hermetically sealed case with a 50 - ml aliquot of liquid silane ( 3 - aminopropyl triethoxysilane , Sigma - Aldrich ) at 70 ˚C for 1 h , to attach the silane to the surface of the substrate by vapor deposition . Fluorescent carboxylate - modified beads ( 0 . 1 µm in diameter ; F - 8800 , Life Technologies ) were then attached to the surface of the substrate . The Young’s modulus was estimated to be 13 . 8 kPa for the mixture ratio of 6 : 10 . To measure the traction forces exerted by the mechanical model , a large elastic sheet of substrate was made . A mixture of CY52 - 276A and B at a weight ratio of 8 : 10 was poured into a dish ( 90 mm in inner diameter and 15 mm in height ) and allowed to solidify at room temperature ( 25 ˚C ) for two days . Another mixture of CY52 - 276A and B at a ratio of 8 : 10 containing zirconia balls ( 0 . 5 mm in diameter ) was then poured on the top of the previous layer and allowed to solidify at room temperature ( 25 ˚C ) for two days . The thicknesses of the bottom and top layers were 10 mm and 0 . 5 mm , respectively . The Young’s modulus was estimated to be 5 . 1 kPa for the mixture ratio of 8 : 10 . The traction forces exerted by keratocytes or the mechanical models were calculated from the displacements of the beads or the zirconia balls using Fiji and its two plug - ins , PIV and FTTC 49 . The regularization parameters were set at 3 × 10 – 10 and 3 × 10 – 8 respectively for the keratocyte and 13 / 27 mechanical model traction force reconstructions . Detection of pushing against the substrate A soft elastic substrate was made in the same manner as the traction force measurements of the mechanical model , except that the zirconia balls were embedded in a straight line . The mechanical model was placed on the line ( Fig . 5I ) . The height of the space in which the mechanical model could move was limited to 14 mm , the same as the diameter of the gel , with an acrylic plate . The displacements of the zirconia balls caused by the movement of the model were recorded from directly behind the model . A soft elastic substrate was made in the same manner as the traction force measurements of keratocytes , except that CY52 - 276A and B were mixed at a weight ratio of 10 : 7 . The Young’s modulus was estimated to be 0 . 1 kPa for the mixture ratio of 10 : 7 . Keratocytes were dispersed on the substrate . The height of the space where the cells can move was limited to their height by placing a 1 % agarose ( 01163 - 76 ; Nacalai Tesque ) gel sheet ( 5 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm ) on them ( Fig . 6A ) . About 30 slices of the optical sections of the fluorescent bead images were recorded at 0 . 3 - µm intervals to construct a 3D image . The height of the beads was analyzed using a self - made Python script . In both the mechanical model and keratocytes , in order to estimate the pushing force using the method of Lo and colleagues 46 , we assumed that two spherical protrusions push the substrate . The pushing force F was calculated as F = 4d 3 / 2 r 1 / 2 Y / 3 ( 1 - p 2 ) , where Y is the Young’s modulus of the substrate , d is the indentation , r is the radius of the spherical protrusion , and p is the Poisson ratio ( assumed to be 0 . 5 50 ) . For keratocytes , focal adhesions were considered as the spherical protrusions , and their cross - sectional area was set to be 24 . 3 µm 2 from our previous study 18 . 14 / 27 Acknowledgements We thank K .
