We conducted a prospective household transmission study of 17 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 and their household contacts to collect data to understand severity and household 18 transmission dynamics in Australia and add to the emerging evidence base for decision making . Large 19 systematic reviews and meta - analyses of severity and transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in households 20 have since been published , although estimates vary by setting . 21 22 Added value of this study 23 This is the first multi - jurisdictional prospective household transmission study of its kind for SARS - CoV - 2 in 24 Australia . Australia experienced low epidemic activity during the study period in 2020 due to robust public 25 health and social measures including extensive PCR testing of symptomatic persons and isolation of all known 26 contacts of confirmed cases . Hence , we describe the transmission dynamics in our cohort , i . e . in a low incidence 27 setting and provide estimates of the household secondary attack rate , the relative susceptibility of children 28 compared to adults , and transmission from children compared to adults . 29 30 Implications of all the available evidence 31 Our findings describe the epidemiology of COVID - 19 in Australian households in 2020 , and demonstrate the 32 effectiveness of public health measures to limit transmission in this setting . Comparisons to other household 33 transmission studies must be interpreted in light of the local epidemiology and context including study design , 34 and sampling methods . Additional research is needed to incorporate genomic and serological data to further 35 study transmission dynamics in our cohort . Continued development of the FFX study platform in Australia will 36 enable integration into surveillance systems and help inform targetted public health responses to future 37 infectious disease emergencies . 38 .

Implementation strategies were developed for 47 participating sites ; all household members provided baseline epidemiological data and were followed for 14 48 days from case identification . Household contacts completed symptom diaries and had respiratory swabs taken 49 at baseline , day 7 and day 14 , and day 28 where applicable . We modelled the spread of COVID - 19 within 50 households using a susceptible - exposed - infectious - recovered - type model , and calculated the household 51 secondary attack rate and key epidemiological parameters . 52 53 Findings : 54 96 households with 101 cases and 286 household contacts were recruited into the study between April – October 55 2020 . Forty household contacts tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 in the study follow - up period . Our model 56 estimated the household secondary attack rate to be 15 % ( 95 % CI 8 – 25 % ) , which scaled up with increasing 57 household size . Children were less infectious than their adult counterparts but were also more susceptible to 58 infection . 59 60 Interpretation : 61 Our study provides important baseline data characterising the transmission of early SARS - CoV - 2 strains from 62 children and adults in Australia , against which properties of variants of concern can be benchmarked . We 63 encountered many challenges with respect to logistics , ethics , governance and data management that may have 64 led to biases in our study . Continued efforts to invest in preparedness research will help to test , refine and 65 further develop Australian FFX study protocols in advance of future outbreaks . 66 67 Funding : 68 Australian Government Department of Health 69 .

The findings from this 87 investigation are described here . 88 Australia’s first epidemic wave in 2020 was driven by returned international travellers and subsequent local 89 transmission in major urban centres across the country . Public health and social measures were introduced to 90 control the escalating epidemic , which included : border closures , expanded case management and contact 91 tracing , and social measures such as density quotients in workplaces and public venues and lockdowns . 92 Mandatory quarantine for returned international travellers was also introduced to reduce the risk of further 93 importation . These measures drove incident cases in Australia to very low levels , and effective elimination 94 ( sustained periods of zero case incidence ) was achieved in many states and territories by May 2020 . A national 95 strategy was set to pursue no community transmission of COVID - 19 in the absence of widespread vaccine 96 coverage . 9 97 .

Australia’s second most 99 populous state , Victoria , experienced a second epidemic wave of activity from late May 2020 to November 100 2020 . 101 Several Australian states , including New South Wales ( Australia’s most populous state ) , Victoria and the 102 Australian Capital Territory now have established community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 due to the delta 103 variant . As of December 13 th 2021 , there have been 228 , 930 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 in Australia , 104 including 2104 deaths . Of these cases , 220 , 083 were locally acquired and the majority have been confirmed 105 since June 2021 . 10 , 11 106 .

In addition , we enriched for 120 index paediatric cases by recruiting from the Royal Children’s Hospital Respiratory Infection Clinic ( RCH ) in 121 VIC . Recruitment was active between April – October 2020 , prior to the emergence of any variants of concern 122 ( Supplementary Figures 1 – 4 ) . 123 Households were defined as two or more people living together in a domestic residence or a dwelling or group 124 of dwellings with a shared space . Residential institutions were not included . All locally acquired cases were 125 eligible for recruitment regardless of local source of infection provided they lived within an appropriate 126 geographical area for logistics ( i . e . , metropolitan areas ) , and were not in mandated 14 - day quarantine . All 127 household members of eligible cases were required to provide their consent to participate . Hospitalised index 128 cases were eligible for recruitment as we assumed that household contacts were exposed by the time 129 hospitalisation of the index case has occurred . Households were excluded when all household members were 130 infected at the time of the initial visit , making the direction of transmission events unclear and unobservable . 131 132 Epidemiological data were collected from confirmed cases and household contacts as close as possible to 133 laboratory confirmation ( day 0 / baseline ) of the index case , including health status interviews on days 7 , 14 and 134 where available day 28 . The questionnaires collected details on participant demographics , symptoms and 135 .

Household contacts also completed 136 daily symptom diaries ( via SMS ) and provided specimens in line with Public Health Laboratory Network advice 137 at baseline , days 7 , 14 and where available day 28 . Respiratory swabs were professionally or self - collected 138 depending on study site and were tested by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) in the state of collection . 12 139 Households were cleared from the project at day 14 if all household contacts were symptom free and tested 140 negative for COVID - 19 at previous study timepoints ( baseline and days 7 / 14 ) . Index / primary cases did not 141 complete symptom diaries or provide further swabs during their involvement in the study . 142 143 Deidentified data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at The 144 University of Melbourne . Ethics approval was not required for the FFX public health components being led 145 through state and territory health departments as the project was recognised as an enhanced national public 146 health surveillance activity . Ethics approval for the FFX project at the RCH site was obtained through the 147 Murdoch Children’s Research Institute Ethics Committee ( ref : 63666 ) . 148 149 Analysis 150 Descriptive analyses were performed to explore the characteristics of initially confirmed cases and their 151 household contacts . 152 The household secondary attack rate ( HSAR ) was defined as the proportion of household contacts that were 153 eventually infected in their study follow - up . We assumed that individuals tested positive for COVID - 19 by PCR 154 if and only if they had COVID - 19 ( i . e . , the false positive rate is zero ) and infected household contacts had at 155 least one positive PCR test during their follow - up period . We classified all further detected cases within 156 households as secondary cases and assumed that the primary case was the source of infection . 157 We characterised and modelled disease spread within households using an SEIR - type compartmental 158 mathematical model previously developed for pandemic influenza 13 - 15 , and adapted it for COVID - 19 according 159 to early evidence about the incubation period and the generation interval . 16 The model allows for pre - and 160 asymptomatic infection status , and is age - structured allowing for age - specific contact rates . 17 Adults were 161 defined as 18 years old or older , and children were defined as less than 18 years old . The rate of transmission 162 was allowed to scale depending on the household size . Model parameters were estimated using a bespoke 163 Markov chain Monte Carlo method 15 - 16 ; additional model details are outlined in the Supplementary Technical 164 Appendix . Median posterior estimates and 95 % credible intervals ( CrI ) are reported . 165 .

We used logistic regression models to investigate the association between the HSAR and case - 169 and household - level covariates . Multilevel mixed - effects logistic regression models were used to account for 170 multiple observations per household in the contact - level HSAR analysis . The covariates used in these models 171 are detailed in Supplementary Table 3 . Households with co - primary cases were excluded from the statistical 172 HSAR analysis but are included in the household model analysis . 173 174 Alpha was set to 0·05 , and covariates that had a p - value of < 0·2 in univariate regression analysis were included 175 in the multivariable models for the different variable levels . Adjusted odds ratios , adjusted marginal estimates of 176 the HSAR , and associated 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) were produced for each included covariate . 177 178 Data cleaning and descriptive analyses were performed in R , ( https : / / www . r - project . org / ) . 18 Statistical HSAR 179 analyses were performed in Stata version 16·0 ( StataCorp LLC , College Station , Texas ) . 19 All modelling and 180 parameter estimation was performed using Julia 1 . 6 . 0 ( https : / / julialang . org ) . 20 181 .

Three households had a false positive index case and 187 were subsequently removed . Four households had incomplete study data . Supplementary Figure 1 shows 188 recruitment into our study over time in relation to the number of locally acquired cases in Australia and in states 189 that contributed data ( Supplementary Figures 2 – 4 ) . 190 191 FFX cases had a median age of 29 years ( Interquartile range 15 – 42 ) and there were slightly more female cases 192 than males . Thirty - five of the confirmed cases were children ( < 18 years old ) . Further case and contact 193 participant characteristics can be seen in Table 1 . The median household size was 4 ( IQR 3 – 5 ) and ranged from 194 2 – 10 persons ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . 195 196 Table 1 : Characteristics of included case and household contact participants in the FFX project 197 198 Confirmed cases ( n = 101 , from 96 households ) Household contacts ( n = 286 ) Age , years Mean ( SD ) 28·0 ( 18·3 ) 28·0 ( 19·3 ) Median ( IQR ) 29·0 ( 15·0 – 42·0 ) 26·0 ( 11·0 – 44·0 ) Age group , No .

The modelling analysis is based on 206 households with sufficient data ( 92 households comprising of 230 adults and 140 children ) . Of the included 207 households , 68 had a single case only and experienced no secondary transmission . Final size distributions ( i . e . , 208 the total number of individuals with laboratory - confirmed infections within a household over the period of 209 monitoring ) are shown in Figure 1 . 210 211 Figure 1 : Final size distributions for the 92 households , where N is the size of the household .

Prior distributions are shown in grey . 236 237 Household transmission dynamics – statistical analysis 238 239 Using the contact - level mixed - effects logistic regression model and excluding households with co - primary 240 cases , the HSAR estimate was found to be 12 % ( 95 % CI 7 – 17 % ) . Details of the multivariable logistic regression 241 models at the various factor - levels are presented in Supplementary Table 4 . The odds ratio estimate for 242 household size was 1·31 ( 95 % CI 0 . 97 – 1·77 , p = 0 . 080 ) , representing an average 31 % increase in the odds of 243 secondary infection within the household for each one person increase in household size . There is some 244 evidence to suggest that HSAR is associated with the relationship between cases and their contacts – 245 parents / guardians / carers and siblings had lower odds of being a secondary case when children were the primary 246 case . The other covariates included in the multivariable models were not found to be associated with the HSAR . 247 248 Severity 249 250 Four confirmed cases were hospitalised during their follow - up period ( Case hospitalisation rate , 2 . 8 % ( 4 / 141 ) , 251 95 % CI 0 . 9 – 7 . 5 % ) and no deaths were reported in our cohort . 252 253 Overall , 31 . 9 % ( 45 / 141 ) of confirmed cases were asymptomatic ( 95 % CI 24 – 40 % ) . 10 / 101 ( 9 . 9 % ) were 254 asymptomatic primary cases at baseline and 35 / 40 ( 87 . 5 % ) secondary cases were asymptomatic during their 255 follow - up .

We demonstrate that the HSAR increases with household size . Children were 262 relatively more susceptible to infection compared to adults when exposed and were also less infectious than 263 their adult counterparts . 264 265 The ‘gold - standard’ mathematical model captures the complex timing and dynamics of transmission in 266 households . Thus , we believe these results to be more robust than those produced by the statistical models . 267 Associations in the statistical modelling need to be taken with caution due to the small sample size and our 268 underlying assumption that all cases we observe in our households are attributed to the primary case – an 269 assumption that is not required in the mathematical model . However , the statistical model results are important 270 as they are broadly consistent with the results from the robust mathematical modelling approach , and represent 271 the standard analytic method that is used to analyse such household transmission studies . They are presented 272 here such that results from our cohort may be fairly compared to other international studies . 273 274 Our HSAR estimate is consistent with estimates from two systematic review and meta - analyses of household 275 transmission . 21 , 22 We note that our results differ from similar household transmission studies including studies 276 based on the WHO UNITY protocols , such as the FFX study conducted in the UK , which estimated a higher 277 base HSAR that decreased with increasing household size . 23 - 33 Other studies using population surveillance data , 278 which represent transmission within a broader range of settings than the household , have estimated lower 279 relative susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection for children compared to adults . 34 , 35 280 281 It can be difficult to make direct comparisons between studies that are conducted in different countries and 282 settings due to the unique features of local epidemics and adaptations required for implementation . Studies 283 should be interpreted in light of the local epidemiology and context – considerations should be made for the 284 surveillance and contact tracing capacity , local incidence of COVID - 19 cases during study implementation , 285 predominant circulating SARS - CoV - 2 variant , the timing and duration of the study , and study design including 286 case ascertainment strategies and specimen sampling methods . Characteristics of individuals affected by 287 COVID - 19 and recruited into the study such as socioeconomic status , occupation and size of recruited 288 households may also be significantly different across these studies , and therefore may influence aggregate 289 .

Additionally , differences in public health interventions such as : test , trace and isolate capacity and 290 practices ; behavioural and distancing measures ; mobility restrictions ; communication campaigns ; and varying 291 degrees of community engagement and cohesion in response , could also help to explain how estimates may vary 292 across countries and settings . 293 294 We note ascertainment and recruitment bias in our study cohort that may contribute to some of the differences 295 we observe to other studies – we excluded households where all members of these households were already 296 infected at baseline . This was more likely to exclude smaller households than larger households for 297 participation , and subsequently may have resulted in the HSAR for smaller households being underestimated . 298 Our modelling outputs are therefore influenced more strongly by larger households , particularly three large 299 outbreaks in households with more than five household members . These may be outliers and as such the 300 observed effect could disappear if more data had been collected including from smaller households who 301 experienced rapid transmission making them ineligible for recruitment . Additional sources of data could help us 302 understand the extent to which our results are influenced by our inherent study biases and if our HSAR estimate 303 is an underestimate , or if it is rather a feature of Australia’s unique epidemiology , i . e . transmission in a low 304 incidence setting with stringent public health and social measures to reduce within - household and community 305 transmission . 306 307 We did not observe longer chains of infection in households that had detected secondary transmission . As a 308 result , there were insufficient data to confidently estimate other quantities of interest such as the incubation 309 period , and the pre - symptomatic and symptomatic infectious periods . Although some households experienced 310 larger absolute numbers of cases , in the majority of such households most individuals were already infected at 311 the recruitment baseline or initial swabbing time point ( 90 % of secondary cases were positive by day 7 testing ) . 312 These outcomes were expected especially as public health units provided extensive advice to reduce the 313 probability of additional spread within the household , including advice on mask use , and how to isolate from 314 each other in their homes . Whilst not the case in this cohort , some cases were removed from their household to 315 further mitigate the risk of spread if their home environment was not suitable for quarantine . 316 317 We conducted sensitivity analyses to consider how the arbitrary age cut - off of 18 years to define adults and 318 children and the use of our contact matrices were impacting our results . We explored age cut - offs of 8 , 13 and 16 319 years of age . We found that the estimated HSAR was not sensitive to changes in the age cut - off ( Supplementary 320 .

There are small differences in the probability of symptom onset for the different age cut - offs 321 ( Supplementary Figure 9 ) , although these appear to be centred on the same values . The age cut - off of 16 yielded 322 posterior estimates for the probability of symptom onset that were very similar . There was no sensitivity to the 323 contact matrix being used – this is likely a result of the large number of households who experienced no 324 secondary transmission . 325 326 Our study has several strengths : This is the first multi - jurisdictional household transmission study of its kind for 327 SARS - CoV - 2 in Australia . We provide insights into household transmission with testing of known household 328 contacts regardless of symptoms in a sustained low incidence setting , where there is more certainty about the 329 source of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission being from within the household , rather than the community , compared to 330 a higher incidence setting . The pre - existing relationship between public health departments and APPRISE 331 researchers was an enabling factor to provide capacity for the implementation of the study , as Australian health 332 departments were prioritising hospital preparedness and scaling up testing and contact tracing in early 2020 333 when this study commenced . Our study enriched for paediatric cases through recruitment at the RCH site – 334 children were generally not index cases at the other sites , and as such this recruitment strategy provided us with 335 unique insights into household transmission from children in the Australian context . 336 337 Operationally , our data fields were aligned with the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance Scheme to 338 harmonise with enhanced surveillance efforts and reduce duplication of data collection where possible . Our 339 bespoke REDCap database provided a central repository to analyse FFX data as a national dataset . Analysis and 340 reporting of FFX data was performed in real time to key national and international stakeholders including , the 341 Communicable Diseases Network Australia ( CDNA ) , WHO Headquarters and the WHO Western Pacific 342 Regional Office . 343 344 The lack of an Australian specific protocol with a pre - determined implementation strategy led to issues with 345 logistics , and made it difficult to obtain the relevant ethics and governance approvals for all associated research 346 components . We originally anticipated a 6 – 8 week window of intense recruitment in line with a short and sharp 347 epidemic in early 2020 . Strong social and public health control measures including border closures and 348 mandated hotel quarantine reduced case numbers and subsequently the number of eligible cases and households . 349 Two of our sites ( QLD and SA ) had sustained zero community transmission of COVID - 19 by the time they 350 were ready to recruit in April 2020 and WA achieved this in May 2020 after only recruiting four households . 351 .

These 353 factors prolonged the duration of our study and may have further contributed to our ascertainment bias . 354 Future research will also involve further collection and analysis of associated genomic and serological data in 355 the FFX research components to better understand and confirm the transmission dynamics in our cohort . 356 Genomic data can help confirm our classification of individuals as we assumed additional cases in the 357 household were attributed to the index case . Serological data may identify historic infections in individuals who 358 continue to present as PCR positive but are non - infectious . Serological data may also be important to identify 359 previously undetected infections in household members especially as the rate of false negatives from PCR may 360 not be insignificant . 36 Together these can provide more accurate data to classify household members and 361 subsequently inform attack rate calculations . 362 Our study provides important baseline data characterising the transmission of early SARS - CoV - 2 strains from 363 children and adults in the Australian context , against which properties of emerging variants of concern such as 364 the Alpha and Delta strains can be benchmarked . 37 - 40 We plan to follow our recruited FFX households 365 longitudinally to continue to develop our understanding of household transmission and immunity in the context 366 of emerging variants of concern . This study will be conducted as Australia’s vaccination program continues and 367 throughout the eventual establishment of community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Australia . Research is 368 also currently underway to formally evaluate the implementation of our FFX study to help consolidate on 369 lessons learnt and inform preparedness efforts for future FFX studies in Australia for COVID - 19 or other 370 infectious disease emergencies . 371 372 Conclusion 373 374 The Australian FFX project for COVID - 19 has been useful to provide valuable insight into the epidemiology of 375 SARS - CoV - 2 in Australia despite encountering many challenges in the planning and implementation phases 376 with respect to logistics , ethics , governance and data management . Continued efforts to invest in preparedness 377 research will help to test , refine and further develop Australian FFX study protocols in advance of future 378 outbreaks of concern and ensure they are embedded in pandemic response plans . 41 , 42 Being able to rapidly 379 activate and provide high - quality information in real - time will be useful for epidemic situational assessment and 380 .

The grey curve 658 indicates the prior distribution . 659 660 Additional model details – modelling appendix 661 662 Disease spread within a household was characterised using an SEIR - type compartmental mathematical model 663 previously developed for pandemic influenza 1 - 3 , adapted to COVID - 19 . The model allows for pre - and 664 asymptomatic infection status , and is age - structured with age - specific contact rates . 4 Adults were defined as 18 665 years old or older , and children were defined as less than 18 years old . 666 667 The structure of the model is illustrated in Appendix Figure 1 with associated parameters described in Appendix 668 Table 1 . The classes are split into multiple , identical stages , which makes the distribution of time spent within 669 each class Erlang distributed ( rather than exponential ) to more accurately reflect the distribution time in each 670 period . The number of stages was chosen to reflect evidence about the distributions of the incubation period 671 and / or the generation interval . 5 672 673 cutoff = 16 cutoff = 18 cutoff = 7 cutoff = 12 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 probability of displaying symptoms den s i t y Adult Child Prior .

The transmission rate from an infectious adult of age n to a susceptible adult of age 675 m is given by 676 677 β(cid:2) (cid:0) , (cid:3) (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:5) 1(cid:7) (cid:4) 678 where parameters are as described in Appendix Table 1 . The infection rate is scaled based on an individual’s age 679 – specifically , the rate of transmission from an adult to a child is multiplied by (cid:8) (cid:5) , the rate of transmission from a 680 child to an adult is multiplied by (cid:8) (cid:6) , and the rate of transmission from a child to another child is multiplied by 681 (cid:8) (cid:5) (cid:8) (cid:6) . The terms (cid:8) (cid:5) and (cid:8) (cid:6) represent the relative susceptibility and transmissibility of children , respectively . 682 683 684 Appendix Figure 1 : SEIR model structure for the spread of COVID - 19 within a household . This illustrates the 685 epidemiological states an individual may be in and how they transition between these states . These states are : S 686 ( susceptible ) ; E 1 , 2 , 3 ( exposed ) ; P 1 , 2 , 3 ( pre - symptomatic and infectious ) ; I 1 , 2 ( infectious and symptomatic ) ; I 1a , 2a 687 ( infectious and asymptomatic ) , and ; R ( recovered ) . The red arrow indicates the transition when an individual 688 begins to show symptoms . At some point within the infectious period an individual may be hospitalised , and 689 hence removed from the household . 690 691 Appendix Table 1 : Parameters for the model shown in Appendix Figure 1 . 692 693 Parameter Description N Size of household (cid:2) (cid:0) , (cid:3) Contact rate between age n and m individuals 1 / (cid:11) Average time spent in exposed states 1 / (cid:12) Average time spent in pre - symptomatic states 1 / (cid:13) Average time spent in states I 1 , I 2 , I 1a and I 2a (cid:14) (cid:7) Probability of developing symptoms for adults (cid:14) (cid:8) Probability of developing symptoms for children (cid:15) Rate of infection from adults to adults per contact in a S E 1 E 2 P 3 I 1 I 2 I 1a I 2a R E 3 P 2 P 1 exposed pre - symptomaticinfectious symptomatic infectious asymptomatic infectious susceptible recovered .

The likelihood is estimated using a particle filter that targets the final size of the outbreak within 696 a house , thus we ignore temporal information such as the timing of tests and symptom onset . This approach is 697 adopted as there is very little temporal information and what is available is poorly resolved . 698 699 Prior distributions for all parameters of the model are given below : 700 (cid:17) (cid:9) (cid:18) (cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:12) (cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:19) (cid:13) (cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:7) (cid:20) Gamma (cid:3)5 , 1 / 3(cid:7) (cid:11) (cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:20) N(cid:3)5 (cid:23) 56 (cid:5) (cid:12) (cid:10)(cid:11) , 0 (cid:23) 41 (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:12) (cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:20) U(cid:3) 0 , 2 (cid:7) (cid:13) (cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:5) 1 (cid:20) Gamma(cid:3)5 , 3 / 5(cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:5) (cid:20) Gamma(cid:3)5 , 1 / 7(cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:6) (cid:20) Gamma(cid:3)10 , 1 / 9(cid:7) (cid:14) (cid:7) (cid:20) Beta(cid:3)4 , 8 / 3(cid:7) (cid:14) (cid:8) (cid:20) Beta(cid:3)4 , 8 / 3(cid:7) (cid:16) (cid:20) N(cid:3)1 / 2 , 1 / 4(cid:7) , truncated to (cid:3)(cid:5)1 . 5 , 1 . 5(cid:7) 701 702 The model priors for the average latent period and pre - symptomatic infectious periods ( σ (cid:10)(cid:11) and λ (cid:10)(cid:11) ) were fitted 703 using data on exposure windows and symptom onset times from Lauer et al . ( 2020 ) . 5 This distribution is 704 calculated using a particle marginal Metropolis Hastings method assuming a uniform [ 0 , 10 ] prior on 1 / σ ( the 705 average exposed period ) , a uniform [ 0 , 10 ] prior on 1 / λ ( the average pre - symptomatic infectious period ) and 706 discrete uniform ( 1 , 15 ) shape parameters for each distribution . The resulting joint distribution on (cid:11) (cid:10)(cid:11) and 707 (cid:12) (cid:10)(cid:11) was found to be well approximated by the parametric combination given above . 708 709 The prior for the average infectious period (cid:13) (cid:10)(cid:11) was chosen with a mode of 3·4 days and a mean of 4 days . The 710 key quantity which arises from these temporal parameters is the generation time . The distribution for this was 711 obtained by sampling from the joint prior of the parameters ( (cid:17) (cid:9) , (cid:11) (cid:10)(cid:11) , (cid:12) (cid:10)(cid:11) , (cid:13) (cid:10)(cid:11) ) and using simulation of the full 712 compartmental model in a fully susceptible population . The final size depends on the transmissibility and 713 generation time distribution , and the effective prior for the generation time distribution is shown in 714 Supplementary Figure 7 . 6 This is consistent with the distribution reported in Ferretti et . al ( 2020 ) . 7 715 .

Each of these distributions are 717 relatively uninformative which captures the prior uncertainty in the parameter values surrounding the 718 differences between children and adults in relation to transmission . The prior distribution on both the 719 observation probabilities was centered around 0·6 . The prior distribution on the effect of household size , (cid:16) was 720 taken to be a Normal distribution with mean 0 . 5 and variance 0 . 25 truncated on the interval ( - 1·5 , 1·5 ) . This 721 facilitates the possibility of density dependent transmission when (cid:16) (cid:18) 0 and frequency dependent transmission 722 when (cid:16) (cid:18) 1 . 723 References for supplementary information 724 1 Black AJ , Geard N , McCaw JM , McVernon J , Ross JV .
