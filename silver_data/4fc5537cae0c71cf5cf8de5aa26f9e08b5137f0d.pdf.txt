Capps b a Department of child care and Youth Services , Giresun University , Giresun , turkey ; b Department of Mathematics and Science education , University of Georgia , Athens , Georgia , USA ABSTRACT We present an example of a novel , model - based approach to instruction in which learners constructed a representation of a specific phenomenon , evaluated their representation , and then revised it , via an abstraction process , to construct a model . The example took place in high school in the context of solution chemistry . The aim of the instruction was to support students in developing a generalized model for a homogenous mixture where the ratio of the solute and solvent remains the same throughout the solution . Students also developed a general model of the effect of pressure and temperature on solubility . Pre - and posttests were administered to provide evidence of student learning because of the experience . Engaging students in scientific practices , like modeling , is important because it can support them in understanding natural phenomena ( National Research Council ( NRC ) 2012 ; Windschitl et al . 2012 ) and in learning about the nature of science ( NRC 2012 ; Schwarz et al . 2009 ) . The practice of modeling involves the gen - eration , evaluation , and revision of scientific models ( Gilbert and Justí 2016 ; NRC 2012 ; Schwarz et al . 2009 ) , where models are deliberate simplifications ( National Research Council ( NRC ) 2007 ) , or abstract representations of phenomena that make their central features explicit ( Schwarz et al . 2009 ) . In this article , we will provide an example of an innovative approach to model con - struction , developed based on the work of Author ( 2020 ) , in which students work toward generating an abstract model of a scientific concept by first generating a specific representation of a phenom - enon , then they evaluate their specific represen - tation against additional instances of that phenomenon , and finally revise their representa - tion so that it is sufficiently general , or abstract enough , to explain all instances , to be what we will call a model of the concept . The example was carried out in a 10th and an 11th grade classroom in Turkey , where students are learning about concepts in solution chemistry and about what models are . Data from pre - and posttests will provide evidence of student learning . Our conception of models and the approach to model generation There is widespread agreement in modeling lit - erature that models are abstractions ( Fortus , Shwartz , and Rosenfeld 2016 ; Schwarz et . al . 2009 ) . Following Capps and Shemwell ( 2020 ) we define models as “abstractions of the structure of their referents that have transferability to their referents” ( p . 2010 ) . The approach to model gen - eration we present here is an abstracting process , called synthesis modeling , where learners con - struct a pictorial model by pulling away a model structure from two or more specific situations that are outwardly different , but share the same underlying structure . Synthesis modeling com - bines an abstracting process for learning deep structures ( Gick and Holyoak 1983 ) with repre - sentational practices of explanatory modeling ( Clement and Steinberg 2002 ) . In the example of synthesis modeling , described below , students generate a specific representation for a phenom - enon in chemistry . Then , they evaluate their rep - resentation by comparing it to other examples of the phenomenon that are outwardly different , but © 2022 taylor & Francis Group , LLc CONTACT Gülüzar eymur guluzar . eymur @ giresun . edu . tr Giresun University , Güre campus , Department of child care and Youth Services , 28100 , Giresun , turkey . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1080 / 00368121 . 2022 . 2071814 KEYWORDS Molecular modeling ; solutions ; high school ; chemical education research 136 G . EYMUR AND D . K . CAPPS share the same underlying structure . Finally , they are asked to revise their initial representation so that it will pertain to all of the examples they encountered . In doing so , students construct an abstract model of the concept by pulling the structure away from the different examples they encountered . Solution chemistry : the context of the modeling activity Solution chemistry plays a key role in the high school chemistry curriculum . An understanding of solutions undergirds the learning of more complicated chemistry concepts such as chemical equilibrium , electrochemistry , chemical kinetics , and acid - base equilibrium ; Prieto , Blanco , and Rodriguez 1989 ) . However , when students learn about solutions , they tend to do so in the context of liquids , and this understanding does not always transfer to solutions of other states ( Çalık and Ayas 2005 ; Uzuntiryaki and Geban 2005 ) . As with many other concepts in chemistry , developing scientific understanding of solutions requires stu - dents to have a generalized understanding of concepts that often cut across macroscopic , sub - microscopic , and symbolic representations ( Gabel 1999 ) . We believe that the scientific practice of modeling , particularly a modeling process that is tooled for generating abstract representations , could be helpful in supporting students in learn - ing chemistry topics like these , that cut across different representational scales . This is consistent with arguments made in the Framework for K - 12 Science Education ( NRC 2012 ) and conforms with the architecture of Next Generation Science Standards performance expectations which advo - cate integrating science practices , disciplinary core ideas , and crosscutting concepts in instruc - tion ( NGSS Lead States 2013 ) . Instructional context The instruction took place in one 10th grade and one 11th grade classroom in a public high school in northeastern Turkey . There were 32 students in the 10th grade classroom ( 18 girls and 14 boys ) and 31 students in the 11th grade classroom ( 16 boys and 15 girls ) . Students ranged in age from 15 to 17 . All spoke Turkish as their native language and their socioeconomic statuses were unknown . The instructor was the first author of this article . Modeling lessons Modeling - based lessons were designed to engage students in generating , evaluating , and revising explanatory models for the arrangement of micro - scopic particles for two key topics related to solu - tion chemistry : homogenous mixtures and factors affecting solubility in homogenous mixtures such as temperature and pressure . Each topic consisted of two , 50 - min periods of instruction . For both topics , in the first lesson students generated a representation and in the second lesson they eval - uated and revised their representation so it would serve as a model . The mode of instruction of small group work punctuated by whole - class dis - cussion . During small group work the instructor encouraged students’ representation and model generation via guided questions and prompts . Students used chart paper to represent their ideas and present their developing ideas to the whole class . Students were not engaged by external information sources like internet . The instruction was self - contained in that students used only the materials provided and did not engage with addi - tional external resources ( e . g . , the internet ) during instruction . For the sake of brevity , we will pro - vide a detailed description , along with samples of student work , for the first cycle of model gen - eration , and provide only a brief description of the second cycle . Focal lesson sequence on homogenous mixtures Lesson 1 The purpose of this lesson was to help students understand the difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures and to identify the dissolving process of solutions at a micro - scopic state . To introduce the concept of a solution , the lesson began with two questions : “What is the homogeneous and heterogeneous mixture ? Can SCiENCE ACTiviTiES 137 you give examples of these mixtures from your daily life ? ” After eliciting students’ ideas , the instructor worked with their responses to reach a shared definition of the two types of mixtures and provided some examples of each ( see Table 1 ) . Then , to focus students’ attention on homogeneous mixtures the instructor had them watch a video about the dissolving process of salt in water . After the video students were arranged in small groups ( 3 or 4 students / group ) and asked to represent saltwater as a homogenous mixture using a “ ★ ” for H 2 O and a ■ ” and “ ⊚ ” for Na and Cl respectively . By doing this , students developed an initial representation of the disso - lution process of salt in water ( see example in Figure 1 ) . Lesson 2 The purpose of the second lesson was to help students evaluate their initial representation and revise it so it would be abstract enough to rep - resent not just NaCl , but all homogenous solu - tions . Also , the general model would work for other solutions , like sugar water and others in the table because all are homogeneous solutions . To support students in evaluating and revising their representation the instructor asked them to consider if their initial representation could stand for other homogenous mixtures , like steel and air . Through small group discussion the students came to realize that their representations were specific to saltwater , both because the symbols represented the ions in solution ( i . e . , sodium and calcium in water ) , and because their depictions represented an aqueous solution , whereas steel is solid mixture of iron and carbon , and air is a gaseous mixture of nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen , and various other gasses . After evaluating their initial representations , and determining that they were insufficient to represent the other mixtures , the instructor Table 1 .

Oil and water , fruit juice , soil Figure 1 . initial , representation developed by a group of students for nacl in water . 138 G . EYMUR AND D . K . CAPPS provided the image shown in Figure 2 . The image included the student’s initial representation for saltwater ( see Figure 1 , bottom right ) , and a rep - resentation for steel and air ( see Figure 1 ) , and challenged the groups to revise their initial rep - resentation so that it could represent all three of these mixtures , and any other homogenous mix - ture . As they began , most students drew repre - sentations in the center that were not models . These representations were not models because they included specific aspects from one or another of the mixtures pictured around the periphery . However , when the instructor pointed out that the model must stand for all the mix - tures , but not be the same as any of them , the students began to make progress . Once the models were constructed , the instruc - tor had the students present them to the class . An example final model constructed by students is shown in Figure 3 . During the presentations , the teacher asked students two questions : What is a solution ? What is a model ? As part of this discussion , students answered the questions and critiqued one anothers’ models . The consensus definition for a homogeneous mixture became a mixture where the composition is uniform throughout the mixture . In forming the class - wide definition , students became increasingly careful with their terminology , moving away from spe - cific features of one mixture to all general mix - tures . When asked to describe a model , students mentioned that their revised models were more powerful than their initial representations because they “could explain all kinds of homogeneous mixtures . ” Thus , the activity appeared to push on students’ thinking about what models are , spe - cifically , the students began to see models as something more than a copy of a phenomenon ( a well - known problem in the literature , see Grosslight et al . ( 1991 ) and Tasquier , Levrini , and Dillon ( 2016 ) for details ) , as they recognized that a good model should be abstract enough to explain many kinds of homogeneous mixtures , putting their thinking more in line with the defi - nition of models we provided at the beginning of the article , that is , models are abstractions of the structure of their referents that have trans - ferability to their referents . In lessons 3 and 4 , students learned about the effects of temperature and pressure on solubility and developed a general model to explain how temperature and pressure impacts solubility . In lesson 3 , students watched a video related to how temperature affected the solubility of carbon dioxide in water . After watching the video , the instructor asked students to develop an initial representation that included how these factors affect the solubility of the solution . In lesson 4 , students watched a second video on how pressure affected the gas in a movable piston . They then evaluated their initial repre - sentation and , as in lesson 2 , they were asked to construct a general model for how tempera - ture and pressure affected the solubility of both homogenous mixtures . The generalized model Figure 2 . image projected to start students on the modeling process . Figure 3 . example of a general model developed by students at the end of lesson . SCiENCE ACTiviTiES 139 showed that increasing the number of collisions between solid and solvent particles , either by increasing the temperature or pressure , increased the solubility of the solvent . Developing the assessment To measure students’ understanding of solutions , we developed an assessment that included nine multiple - choice items . The assessment was devel - oped based on procedures described by Treagust , Chittleborough , and Mamiala ( 2002 ) . Each item contained four distractors that were students’ misconceptions about solutions and one correct response . The items were based on the content of the model - based teaching lessons and high school chemistry curriculum in Turkey . Distractors came from known misconceptions about solutions identified in the literature ( Çalık and Ayas 2005 ; Uzuntiryaki and Geban 2005 ) and from the AAAS Science Assessment Website ( American Association for the Advancement of Science 2003 ) In advance of piloting the assessment , face valid - ity of the items was tested by four chemistry teachers . In advance of the instruction , the assess - ment was piloted with 63 10th and 11th grades students . Based on the pilot , several items were revised slightly because of unclear sentences and wording before preparing the last version of the assessment ( see Appendix A for final version ) . The assessment was given to students before and after the model - based teaching instruction . It took 25 min to complete . Results and discussion In this part of paper , we presented empirical findings to focus on differences in students’ understanding with grades that were analyzed by using independent t - test analysis . The pre - posttests results were analyzed to address differences between 10th and 11th grade students’ understanding on solutions after they engage in model - based teaching instruction . The pretest scores of 10th and 11th grades were as M = 3 . 92 , SD = 2 . 02 and M = 4 . 50 , SD = 1 . 50 , respectively . After modeling - based teaching instruction , the post - test scores of 10th and 11th grades were as M = 5 . 40 , SD = 1 . 32 and M = 6 . 66 , SD = 1 . 75 , respectively . There were significant differences between pretest and post - test scores of 10th and 11th grades ; t ( 60 ) = −3 . 06 and p = 0 . 004 for 10th grade and t ( 62 ) = −4 . 58 and p ≪0 . 001 for 11th grade . This suggests that although both groups of students gained under - standing as a result of instruction , the older stu - dents had greater gains . ( M : Mean , SD : Standard Deviation , t : t - statistics , p : p value ) . Conclusion In this article , we provided an example of an innovative approach to model construction in the context of solution chemistry and presented evi - dence that students learned science concepts and about the nature of models . Although there was no control group , evidence from the pre - and posttests suggest that the approach likely helped students advance their understandings about what homogenous solutions are and about how pres - sure and temperature impact solubility . In addition , our findings revealed that there was a significant difference between tenth and eleventh grade levels in terms of students’ under - standing of solution concepts . These results also contributed to the literature about students’ age and grade levels influencing their understanding of models . Our findings were also consistent with other research that presented that age has an impact on students’ understanding of models with older students understanding more ( Chittleborough et al . 2005 ; Grosslight et al . 1991 ) while some scholars did not confirm these differences with age and grade level ( Treagust et al . 2002 ) . Moreover , classroom discussions during model development provide evidence that students explicitly understood that models they con - structed were not copies , as they could explain a class of phenomena within a concept . Though the current example was set in a chemistry con - text , we believe that the ideas presented here can be easily adapted to other science contexts ( see Capps and Shemwell , 2020 and the https : / / mod - elingbigideas . org / . for more examples ) . Key to this adaptation would be selecting a concept to teach which would provide learners with multiple instances , which share an underlying structure , from which they could construct a model . 140 G .

SCiENCE ACTiviTiES 141 Appendix A Examples of Questions 1 . Sugar is added and mixed in a little water until no more sugar is dissolved . Which of the following statements would you agree with ? a . When sugar dissolves , sugar molecules melt and become liquid by mixing b . By mixing , sugar molecules are broken down into small particles and then they are not vis - ible in water c . Sugar molecules fill the air pockets in the water and disappear d . Sugar dissolves in water and forms a solution with water e . Sugar reacts chemically with water 2 . In the figure , if the piston is pressed at constant temperature while in equilibrium with CO 2 gas and CO 2 dissolved in water , which of the following state - ment is correct for the amount of CO 2 dissolved in water ? a . When the piston is pressed down , CO 2 gas reacts more easily with water and the amount of dissolved CO 2 increases . b . As the pressure increases when the piston is pressed down , the CO 2 gas becomes liquid and the amount of dissolved CO 2 increases . c . Since the volume of the solution decreases when the piston is pressed down , the solu - bility of CO 2 gas also decreases and dissolved CO 2 decreases . d . Since the pressure will increase when the pis - ton is pressed down , the dissolution rate of CO 2 gas increases , but the amount of dissolved CO 2 does not change since its solubility will not change . e . Since the pressure will increase when the piston is pressed down , the solubility of CO 2 gas in water increases and the amount of dissolved CO 2 increases . 3 . A certain amount of sugar water solution can be seen in Figure 1 . The bold shapes show the sugar molecules . Water molecules are not shown to facilitate the shape . Figure 2 shows the situation after half of the solution is poured . Which of the illustrations best shows the sugar solution after half pouring the solution at below ?
