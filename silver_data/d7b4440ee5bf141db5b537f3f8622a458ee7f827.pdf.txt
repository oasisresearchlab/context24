Acquiring the ability to internalize macromol - ecules and digest them intracellularly would have allowed primordial cells to move out from their food sources and pursue a predatory ex - istence ; one that might have led to the devel - opment of endosymbiotic relationships with mitochondria and plastids . Thus , it is ﬁtting that endocytosis was ﬁrst discovered and named as the processes of cell “eating” and “drinking . ” In1883 , thedevelopmentalbiologistIlyaMetch - nikoff coined the term phagocytosis , from the Greek “phagos” ( to eat ) and “cyte” ( cell ) , after observing motile cells in transparent starﬁsh larva surround and engulf small splinters that he had inserted ( Tauber 2003 ) . Decades later , in 1931 , Warren H . Lewis , one of the earliest cell “cinematographers” coined the term pino - cytosis , from the Greek “pinean” ( to drink ) , af - ter observing the uptake of surrounding media into large vesicles in cultured macrophages , sar - coma cells , and ﬁbroblasts by time - lapse imag - ing ( Lewis 1931 ; Corner 1967 ) . Importantly , these pioneering studies also revealed that the function of endocytosis goes well beyond eating and drinking . Indeed , Metchnikoff , considered one of the founders of modern immunology , realized that the phagocytic behavior of the mesodermal amoe - boidcellshehad observedunder themicroscope could serve as a general defense system against invasive parasites , in the larva as in man . This revolutionary concept , termed the phagocytic theory , earned Metchnikoff the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on phagocytic immunity , which he shared with Paul Ehrlich who discovered the com - plementary mechanisms of humoral immuni - ty that led to the identiﬁcation of antibodies ( Vaughan 1965 ; Tauber 2003 ; Schmalstieg and Goldman 2008 ) . The phagocytic theory was a milestone in immunology and cell biology , and formally gave birth to the ﬁeld of endocytosis . Key discoveries over the intervening years , aided in large part by the advent of electron mi - croscopy , revealed multiple pathways for endo - cytosis in mammalian cells that fulﬁll multiple critical cellular functions ( Fig . 1 ) . These mech - anistically and morphologically distinct path - ways , andtheirdiscoverers , includeclathrin - me - diated endocytosis ( Roth and Porter 1964 ) , caveolae uptake ( Palade 1953 ; Yamada 1955 ) , cholesterol - sensitive clathrin - and caveolae - in - dependent pathways ( Moya et al . 1985 ; Hansen et al . 1991 ; Lamaze et al . 2001 ) , and , more re - cently , the large capacity CLIC / GEEC pathway ( Kirkham et al . 2005 ) .

These electron - dense trac - ers allowed researchers to identify cellular struc - turesassociatedwiththeuptakeandintracellularsortingofreceptor - bound ligands . A particular - ly striking example is the pioneering work of Roth and Porter , who in 1964 observed the up - take of yolk proteins into mosquito oocytes . To synchronize uptake , they killed female mosqui - tos at timed intervals after a blood feed and ob - served the sequential appearance of electron - dense yolk granules in coated pits , coated and uncoated vesicles , and progressively larger vesi - cles . Their remarkable observations accurately described coated vesicle budding , uncoating , homo - and heterotypic fusion events , as well as the emergence of tubules from early endosomes ( Fig . 2 ) , all of which are now known hallmarks of the early endocytic trafﬁcking events . Another milestone in the ﬁeld of endocyto - sis was the discovery of the lysosome by Chris - tian de Duve ( Appelmans et al . 1955 ) . Whereas the ﬁnding of phagocytosis and other endocy - tic pathways was possible through microscopy , the discovery of lysosomes originated from a biochemical approach ( Courtoy 2007 ) , which beneﬁted from the invention of the ultracen - trifuge . de Duve and coworkers observed that preparations of acid phosphatase obtained by subcellular fractionation had an unusual behav - ior : contrary to most enzymatic activities , the activity of acid phosphatase increased rather than decreased with time , freezing – thawing of the fractions and the presence of detergents . Interestingly , the same was true for other hydro - lases , which depended on acidic pH for their optimal activity . This led him to postulate that the acid hydrolases were contained in acidiﬁed membrane - bound vesicles . In collaboration with Alex Novikoff , he visualized these vesicles , the lysosomes , by electron microscopy ( Beaufay et al . 1956 ) and later showed their content of acid phosphatase ( Farquhar et al . 1972 ) .

These include the growth , invagination , and pinching off of coated pits ( 1 , 2 ) , which concentrate cargo taken up by coated vesicles ( 3 ) , the rapid uncoating of nascent - coated vesicles ( 4 ) , homotypic fusion of nascent endocytic vesicles in the cell periphery ( 5 ) , the formation of tubules from earlyendosomes ( 7 ) , and changes in the intraluminal properties of larger endosomes ( 6 ) . Finally , yolk proteins are stored in granules as crystalline bodies ( 8 ) .

He shared it with Albert Claude and George E . Palade “for their discoveries concerning the structural and functional organization of the cell . ” The im - portance of this work lies also in the signiﬁcant therapeutic applications that followed . The dis - covery by Elizabeth Neufeld and collaborators of uptake of lysosomal enzymes by cells pro - vided the foundation for enzyme replacement therapy for lysosomal storage disorders ( Neu - feld 2011 ) . In the 1970s , research in endocytosis en - tered the molecular era . Using de Duve and Al - bert Claude - like methods of subcellular frac - tionation , Barbara M . Pearse puriﬁed clathrin - coated vesicles from pig brain ( Pearse 1975 ) . A year later , she isolated a major protein species of 180 kDa , which she named clathrin “to indi - cate the lattice - like structures which it forms” ( Pearse 1976 ) . It was a breakthrough that inau - gurated the molecular dissection of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Over the intervening years , the continued application of microscopy ( which now spans from electron cryotomography to live cell , high - resolution ﬂuorescence microscopy ) , ge - netics ( in particular , in yeast , Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster ) , biochem - istry ( including cell - free reconstitution of endo - cytic membrane trafﬁcking events ) , as well as molecular and structural biology have revealed a great deal about the cellular machineries and mechanisms that govern trafﬁcking along the endocytic pathway . A partial , and because of space limitations , necessarily incomplete list of milestones ( Table 1 ) shows how new technol - ogies ( e . g . , green ﬂuorescent protein [ GFP ] fusion proteins , total internal reﬂection micro - scopy , siRNA knockdowns ) enable new dis - coveries . OVERVIEW OF ARTICLES In organizing this collection , our intention was to summarize a great deal of established con - cepts and mechanisms , and also to highlight outstanding questions and controversies in the ﬁeld . We ﬁrst describe our current knowledge of the core molecular machinery governing en - docytosis and transport along the endocytic pathway , followed by examples of the impor - tance of endocytic trafﬁcking in organismal physiology and development , and how defects in endocytosis or its cooptation can lead to and also beneﬁt human disease . Each article ends with a discussion of future perspectives , includ - ing outstanding questions , challenges , and op - portunities for new discovery . The order of articles reﬂects broadly the spatiotemporal progression of cargo from the plasma membrane toward the lysosome . We be - gin with several articles that describe our cur - rent understanding of the molecular machinery and mechanisms driving entry of cargo ( e . g . , receptors and bound ligands ) into the cell , by clathrin - dependent and - independent endocy - tosis ( Traub and Bonifacino 2013 ; Kirchhausen et al . 2014 ; Mayor et al . 2014 ; Merriﬁeld and Kaksonen 2014 ; Mettlen and Danuser 2014 ) . Following internalization , the endocytosed ma - terial is shuttled along an ultrastructurally complex and dynamic pathway of tubular and vesicular compartments collectively known as endosomes , and described in the article by Klumperman and Raposo ( 2014 ) , from which they can be sorted for recycling back to the cell surface or delivered to lysosomes for degrada - tion . Several articles are then devoted to the signals and mechanisms governing these sorting decisions . They cover the molecular machiner - ies responsible for the compartmental organi - zation and function of endosomes ( Wandinger - Ness and Zerial 2014 ) and sorting and transport along endolysosomal pathways ( Bissig and Gruenberg 2013 ; Henne et al . 2013 ; Burd and Cullen 2014 ; Piper et al . 2014 ) . Lysosomes and lysosome - related organelles are discussed in the article by Luzio et al . 2014 ) . Once thought to be “dead - end” receptacles responsible only for degradation , lysosomes have revealed them - selves as dynamic and functionally diverse or - ganelles that can fuse with the plasma mem - brane in response to extracellular cues . The common biophysical challenges faced in de - forming the plasma membrane or endosomes to generate transport vesicles are discussed in S . L .

( 2014 ) , and the endosome - speciﬁc machinery for fusion and ﬁssion that creates the dynamic network of membranes essential for protein sorting along this pathway is described by Gautreau et al . ( 2014 ) . Recent work summarized by Settembre and Ballabio ( 2014 ) has provided insights into the transcriptional regulation of lysosome bio - genesis , autophagy , and clearance . The article by Tooze et al . ( 2014 ) describes recent progress in autophagy or “self - eating , ” a cellular repair mechanism very important for cell homeosta - sis , defense mechanisms , and the prevention of a number of human diseases . Not surprisingly , given its evolutionary im - portance , as suggested by de Duve , many of the proteins that drive endocytosis are highly conserved and can be traced to the earliest eu - karyotic ancestors ; more recent additions to the endocytic machinery are likely indicative of specialization and increased regulation of the endocytic pathways during evolution ( as dis - cussed in the article by Wideman et al . 2014 ) . Some components of the endocytic machinery play “moonlighting” functions in divergent cel - lular processes ( see Brodskyet al . 2014 ) . Wheth - er these components reﬂect their ancestral func - tionsandtheoriginsoftheendocyticmachinery , or new vocations , remains to be determined . The plasma membrane is the conduit for all interactions between cells and their environ - ment . Thus , it has become clear that , besides eating and drinking , these various endocytic pathways and subsequent endosomal sorting events play critical roles in regulating multiple aspects of cell and organismal physiology .

En - docytosis controls and constantly modiﬁes the protein composition of the plasma membrane to respond to environmental changes ( i . e . , up - or down - regulating nutrient receptors and transporters ) and is therefore essential to main - tain cellular and serum homeostasis ( Anto - nescu et al . 2014 ) . In its specialized forms , endocytosis controls the activity and composi - tion of neuronal synapses ( Morgan et al . 2013 ; Cosker and Segal 2014 ) , and immune surveil - lance and antigen presentation in dendritic cells ( ten Broeke et al . 2013 ) , which are critical to organismal physiology . Endocytosis of recep - tor tyrosine kinases and G - protein coupled re - ceptors spatially and temporally controls their signaling activities ( Di Fiore and von Zastrow 2014 ) , whereas endocytosis of adhesion mole - cules and polarity markers controls cell migra - tion and polarity . Together , these functions for endocytosis are essential for tissue morphogen - esis and development ( Bo¨kel and Brand 2014 ; Di Fiore and von Zastrow 2014 ; Eaton and Martin - Belmonte 2014 ; Gonzalez - Gaitan and Ju¨licher 2014 ) . Consequently , defects in endo - cytosis are linked to many human diseases ( Maxﬁeld 2014 ) including cancer ( Mellman and Yarden 2013 ) . Finally , many endocytic pathways are exploited by viruses , bacteria , and toxins to gain entry into the cell ( Cossart and Helenius 2014 ) , and more recently by re - searchers aiming to speciﬁcally and effectively deliver therapeutics for the treatment of human disease ( Akinc and Battaglia 2013 ) . Together , these articles outline the progress toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of macropinocytosis and phagocytosis more than a century after Metchnikoff ’s pioneering mi - croscopic observations . However , Metchnikoff used to translate his morphological observa - tions of cells and tissues into drawings . Photo - microscopy in the 19th century was not a com - mon method ( Schmalstieg and Goldman 2008 ) . Today , advances in light microscopy approaches allow the visualization of cells and tissues in living organisms and this practice promises a great future also in the clinics , as described by Weigert ( 2014 ) in this collection . FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Each article ends with a discussion of speciﬁc unanswered questions and opportunities for fu - ture research . However , collectively , we believe that the most important future challenges in en - docytosis are ( 1 ) to expand our analysis beyond the current limited number of cargo molecules so as to analyze the mechanisms and physiolog - ical implications for cargo - selective regulation of endocytic trafﬁcking ; ( 2 ) to move from cell culture model systems to the study of endocy - tosis and endocytic trafﬁcking in organ cultures and in vivo animal models so as to better un - derstand the diversity of endocytic pathways and their physiological signiﬁcance ; and ( 3 ) to understand how endocytic trafﬁcking and sort - ing processes are regulated at the cellular , tis - sue , and organismal levels to couple endocyto - sis with signaling , neurotransmission , motility , polarity , and other more complex cellular be - haviors . These studies will be aided by new developments in cellular engineering , in vivo imaging , high - throughput discovery research , and computational modeling that will identify the regulatory connectionsthat linkendocytosis with other cellular processes .
