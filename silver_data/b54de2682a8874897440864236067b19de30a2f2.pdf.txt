The receptor can transmit signals to cells : i ) upon interaction with ligands such as EGF , TGFa , amphiregulin or heparin binding EGF , ii ) upon truncation or mutation of extracellular and / or intracellular domains , iii ) upon amplification of a basal receptor activity ( in the absence of ligand ) through cooperation with other cellular signaling pathways or nuclear events ( e . g . expression of v - erbA ) . The activated EGFR can exert pleiotropic functions on cells , depending on their tissue origin and state of differentiation . Under certain conditions it can also contribute to neoplasia and devel - opment of metastases . Such conditions can exist upon aberrant receptor / ligand expression and activation ( e . g . in the wrong cell ; at the wrong time ; in the wrong amounts ) . Aberrant signalling can also occur through constitutive EGFR activation . Oncogenic potential of EGFR has been demonstrated in a wide range of ex - perimental animals . EGFR is also implicated in human cancer , where it may contribute both to the initiation ( glioblastoma ) and progression ( epithelial tumors ) of the disease . EGFR may influence key steps in the pro - cesses of tumor invasion and dissemination . Involvement of EGFR in tumor spread may indicate a potential use of this receptor as a target for antimetastatic therapy . L Introduction The seed and soil hypothesis formulated by Steven Paget more than 100 years ago to explain the orga - notropism of cancer metastases appears still as a valid hypothesis which can be examined at the cel - lular and even molecular level . Signals from the soil , the microenvironment , are transmitted via cell - sur - face receptors into normal or neoplastic cells which then react according to their state of differentiation and development in a specific way . Members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family are frequently im - plicated in experimental models of neoplasia as well as in human cancer . One of the best studied receptor signaling systems from this family is the EGF - receptor ( EGFR ) . The receptor can be stim - ulated upon autocrine or paracrine interaction with corresponding ligands such as EGF and TGF - ( x . Abnormal receptor signaling can occur with trun - cated forms of receptors or receptor over - expres - sion which is observed in some forms of neoplastic development . Receptor stimulation by itself or in combination with other signals can have a variety of biological consequences . Expression and activity of EGFR have been link - ed with a number of human neoplastic diseases or pre - neoplastic stages . We shall discuss influences of the EGFR on cell growth and differentiation , cell - cell interactions , cell matrix adhesion , cell motility , ECM - degradation , invasion and metastasis . From these observations it becomes clear that this recep - tor system can influence a variety of cellular func - tions of importance for malignant growth and me - tastasis and could therefore also play an important role in various forms of human cancer and its pro - gression towards metastasis . 256 EXTRA - CELLULAR REGION DOMAINS [ NH2 I II HI ~ , ~ IV [ INTRA - CELLULAR REGION JM TK CT - T 654 .

The EGFR : a subclass I tyrosine kinase receptor 2 . 1 . structure and function A model of the EGFR domain structure is drawn in Fig . 1 . The mature human EGFR ( HER1 ) is a single polypeptide chain of 1186 amino acids , Mr170 , 000 daltons , containing approximately 40 , 000 daltons of N - linked oligosaccharide and in some cell types mannose phosphate [ for review see : 1 ] . The recep - tor traverses the plasma membrane with a single hy - drophobic anchor sequence . The extracellular ami - no terminal end can be divided into four domains , with the third domain being responsible for high af - finity binding to EGF and probably also other spe - cific ligands of the receptor . The intracellular car - boxy - terminal sequences encode tyrosine kinase and carboxy - terminal regulatory functions . The structural organisation of the EGFR is commonly shared by at least four other monomeric growth fac - tor receptors , HER2 / neu , HER3 , HER4 [ 2 ] and Xmrk , which together with EGFR / HER1 comprise the family of subclass I tyrosine kinase receptors ( for review see : 3 ) . The binding by EGFR of EGF was reported to have a 1 : 1 stoichiometry but two possible affinity states , with the majority of the cell surface ex - pressed receptors exhibiting the lower affinity state . Binding of ligand has been proposed to drive the dimerization or oligomerization of receptors . This process promotes the interaction between kinase domains leading to their activation [ for review see : 3 ] . Binding of ATP to a lysine residue at position 721 within the EGFR kinase domain is the key event required to initiate tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor . All known functions of the EGFR , ex - cluding ligand binding , appear to depend on the ty - rosine kinase activity [ 4 , 5 ] . At least two cytoplasmic regions , the juxtamem - brane and the carboxy terminal domains , regulate the affinity for ligand as well as the activity and specificity of the protein tyrosine kinase function [ 6 , 7 ; for review see 8 ] . The major regulatory sites are targets for phosphorylation by PKC or cross phos - phorylation by EGFR . Phosphorylation of C - ter - minal tyrosine residues is also important for the physical interaction of EGFR with other cellular proteins that carry compatible so called src homol - ogy 2 ( SH2 ) domains ( see Fig . 1 , and below ) . Trun - cation of the carboxy terminal domain has led to constitutive EGFR activity [ 17 , 18 ] . However , sur - prisingly receptor activation does not always seem correlate with receptor phosphorylation [ 19 ] . The SH2 domain is a common feature of many nonreceptor kinases which act in the signal cascade downstream of activated growth factor receptors . This is the major structural feature responsible for interaction of PLC - y , PI3 - kinase , and ras - GAP with the activated EGFR . Raf , a serine / threonine kinase which also associates with EGFR does not contain an SH2 domain . Recruitment of these molecules to the cell surface , their phosphorylation and / or con - formational modulation through interaction with EGFR have been proposed to lead to their activa - tion and secondary signal transduction . The affinity of EGFR for these molecules is variable , being high for PLC - y but particularly low for PI3 - kinase . Therefore , for some molecules and in some cell types successful interactions may dependent on the level of EGFR expression . The complexities of such interactions have been used as a basis to explain the cooperation of different receptors in the activation of growth as well as transformation associated changes [ for reviews see : 21 - 23 ] . 2 . 2 . Naturally occuring truncations At least two EGFR transcripts of 10 . 5 and 5 . 8 kb 257 and occasionally a smaller 2 . 6 kb transcript have been reported in RNA from a variety of human cell lines [ 6 , 24 ] . These transcripts correspond to mRNAs of 10 , 5 and 2 kb in rat cell lines and tissues [ 19 , 25 ] and , 12 and 9 kb in normal chicken embryo [ 26 ] . The two larger EGFR mRNAs have been gen - erally assumed to differ in size because of different lengths of poly - adenylated tails . However the smaller transcript ( 2 - 2 . 6 kb ) is truncated , and hy - bridises only to probes corresponding to the extra - cellular domain of EGFR . This truncated receptor has been detected in the A431 human vulva carcino - ma cell line [ 6 ] and other human squamous carcino - ma cell lines [ 27 ] as well as in the WS1 diploid hu - man fibroblast line ( Khazaie , unpublished ) . A cor - responding truncated EGFR was detected in nor - mal rat liver and in the MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line [ 19 , 25 ] . The truncated EGFR transcript is by virtue of its expression in nomal rat liver and in diploid human fibroblasts , most likely a natural product arising from differential splicing of the EGFR gene tran - script . At least in the case of A431 cells the variant EGFR was shown to contain sequences from a nov - el gene fused at the C - terminal end [ 6 ] and to be secreted extracellularly [ 27 ] . The truncated EGFR can form in vitro a heterodimer with the intact re - ceptor and inhibit both basal and EGF - dependent kinase activity [ 28 ] , however expression of a genet - ically engineered soluble extracellular EGFR do - main had little if any effect on the growth and phe - notype of EGF stimulated NIH - 3T3 cells [ 29 ] . Al - though the physiological function of the protein is as yet unknown , it is tempting to speculate on the possibility of a potential regulatory interaction at the cell surface with the complete EGFR . 2 . 3 . Ligands The first known specific ligand for the EGFR was epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) / urogastrone , which seemed to have an epidermal proliferative function and antagonistic action on gastric acid secretion . EGF is expressed as a 1200 amino acid residue gly - cosylated transmembrane precursor or a 53 amino acid secreted product [ 30 - 32 ] . The secreted EGF is 258 usually considered to be a processed form of the transmembrane precursor . Several distinct pep - tides with specific EGFR binding properties are now known to exist . These include TGF - a , the pox virus growth factors , amphiregulin , and heparin binding EGF 33 , 34 ; for reviews see : 35 - 37 . Com - mon features of all these ligands are a cysteine rich region spanning a length of approximately 50 - 60 amino acid residues , and occurrence in two forms : as shorter secretory peptides , and as large mem - brane bound glycosylated putative precursors , which for EGF and TGF - a are also biologically ac - tive 38 , 39 . In adult tissues , EGF has been primarily local - ized to differentiated cells rather than to stem cells . In epidermis and various glandular tissues , both EGFR and EGF were expressed in differentiating cells 40 . Concentrations of TGF - ~ in the kidney are increased upon injury affecting a number of re - nal responses for reviews see : 41 , 42 . The kidneys are considered to be the major source of urinary EGF , while the prostate is the major source of EGF in the seminal fluid 43 , 44 . Likewise , the mammary tissue is the source of relatively high concentrations of EGF in milk 45 . The major sources of EGF in the CNS are macrophages , glial cells and neurons as well as uptake from the peripheral blood for re - view see : 46 , 47 . EGF - like peptide sequences are present in a va - riety of cell surface and extracellular proteins 45 . The potential function of these peptides as EGFR agonists is of interest , particularly in view of the re - ports on mitogenic activities of extracellular matrix proteins 48 , 49 . 3 . Role in normal development It is now established that the EGFR is expressed throughout development and in a variety of undif - ferentiated as well as differentiated cells for review see : 50 . EGFR and TGF - a are expressed in the preimplantation conceptus and may play a role in blastocoel expansion , embryo - uterine signalling , and the implantation process 51 - 54 . Among the functions attributed to EGFR activity are the pro - liferation and development of specific epithelial territories in the embryo , including branch point morphogenesis and maturation of early embryonic lung tissue , skin development , and promoting sur - vival of early progenitor cells of the cleft palate 55 , 56 ; for review see : 57 . EGFR exhibits a broad expression throughout the brain tissue , primarily in the early post - natal as - trocytes and purkinje cells and in the adult neu - rones of the cerebral cortex , where it may be impor - tant in promoting terminal differentiation 58 , 59 and determining the viability of neurones 60 ; for reviews see : 45 . Purified and cultured astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes respond mitogenically to EGF , in agreement with the higher levels of expres - sion of EGFR and EGF in astrocytic cells of glial origin 61 , 62 . In the hypothalamus , EGFR medi - ates the release of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone ( LHRH ) 63 . An interplay of the actions of EGFR and estro - gen receptor has been proposed to be required for the differentiation of normal mammary epithelial cells as well as the induction of uterine and vaginal growth 64 , 65 . EGFR expression is high in the cap - cell layer of the terminal end buds 66 , a proliferat - ing cell population 67 which is presumed to be the stem cell population of both the luminal and myoe - pithelial cells of the mammary ducts 68 . The cap cell layer is devoid of estrogen receptors which in - stead are abundant in the surrounding stromal cells 66 . It has been proposed that estrogen may regu - late the growth of cap - cells through a paracrine mechanism by stimulating the production of a pep - tide factor for which EGF or TGF - a are prime can - didates 69 . In ovariectomized mice , the exogenous delivery of either EGF or TGF - c ~ was sufficient to restore the pattern of normal ductal growth in the involuted mammary gland . In normal mice distinct - ly different patterns of immunolocalisation were observed for EGF ( inner layers of terminal end buds and in ductal cells of mammary epithelium ) and TGF - o ~ ( epithelial cap cell layer of the advanc - ing terminal end bud and in stromal fibroblasts at the base of the terminal end bud ) suggesting that each polypeptide plays a different role in normal mammary gland morphogenesis 70 . 4 . Role in malignant development Expression and activity of EGFR have been linked with a number of pre - malignant or malignant dis - eases . These include skin hyperplasia , erythroblas - tosis , and fibrosarcoma in animals ; and , in humans , notably benign hyperplasia of the skin , mammary carcinoma , glioblastoma , and hepatic carcinoma . In some instances truncations of the EGFR may be necessary to allow for its function as a dominant on - cogene . In others , over - expression may be needed to amplify a tumor promoting signal . However , it is also apparent that in some instances truncations or overexpression of EGFR are not necessary . Over - all , the combination of activation of EGFR , through autocrine or paracrine loops , and accumu - lation of appropriate genetic alterations may lead to neoplasia and metastasis . 4 . 1 . The oncogenic potential of EGFR in experimen - tal systems The nature of events subverted by EGFR activity may vary depending on the type of cancer studied . This conclusion is most evident when comparing the contribution to different neoplasias of , A : ab - erant expression , B : paracrine activation , C : trunca - tion of EGFR , or D : receptor activation in the con - text of complementing nuclear events . 4 . 1 . 1 . Truncations and aberrant expression in experi - mental neoplasia Initial interest in a transforming potential for the EGFR came from the realisation of the sequence homology between the cloned human receptor and the chicken v - erbB oncogene 71 . The v - erbB on - cogenes are retrovirally transduced and truncated form of the " chicken EGFR " . Expression of v - e rbB by the transforming retroviruses AEV - ES4 and AEV - H , led to erythroleukemia and fibrosarcoma in infected chicks , as well as to the transformation of bone marrow erythroblasts and chicken embryo fi - broblasts ( CEFs ) in culture for reviews see : 72 , 73 . A direct comparison of the transforming func - tions of v - erB and human EGFR was performed by simply using the AEV - ES4 retrovirus to express a 259 complete normal EGFR cDNA instead of v - erB 17 . Surprisingly , the complete human EGFR pro - moted the EGF dependent outgrowth of erythro - blasts from in vitro infected bone marrow cultures . Infection of young chicks with retroviral vectors that co - expressed v - erbA , an altered form of the thyroid hormone receptor gene 74 , 75 , and EGFR led to acute erythroleukemia . The major conse - quence of truncations affecting the extracellular amino terminal end ( removal of the ligand binding domain ) was constitutive activation of the receptor . Truncations of the intracellular carboxy terminal end had much wider consequences affecting not only receptor activity but also the biological func - tion of EGFR kinase . Truncation of 32 carboxy terminal amino acids removing the last two tyrosine autophosphoryla - tion sites ( see Fig . 1 ) conferred additional erythro - poietin receptor properties to human EGFR as as - sayed in primary chicken erythroblasts . Removal of a further 94 amino acids deleting more sites of tyro - sine autophosphorylation inactivated erythroid transformation without diminishing fibroblast transformation ( assayed in vitro ) by human EGFR . Thus , expression of the complete EGFR was suffi - cient to transform ( promote aberrant growth of ) immature erythroblasts , while truncations of the EGFR changed the function of EGFR in a lineage specific manner . In contrast to the apparent absence of EGFR in mature hematopoietic cells , recent observations in - dicate that this receptor is normally expressed in immature / progenitor hematopoietic cells 76 , 77 , Other reports suggest that the EGFR signal trans - duction pathway may function in transformed he - matopoietic cell lines 78 - 82 . Together these ob - servations suggest that EGFR may be a naturally occuring growth / survival factor for immature he - matopoietic cells , which in part explains how inap - propriate expression of this receptor may lead to manifestations of leukemia , the expansion of imma - ture hematopoietic cells . EGFR is abundantly and universally expressed in mature fibroblasts . Ligand induced activation and / or overexpression of the EGFR led to a num - ber of changes in the in vitro behaviour of primary chicken fibroblasts 17 as well as in established mu - 260 rine or rat fibroblast cell lines 83 , 84 which are as - sociated with neoplastic transformation , but did not promote invasive growth of fibroblasts in the chick - en embryo 85 or induce sarcoma in transgenic mice 86 ; Thomas von Rtiden , pets . comm . . These observations confirm earlier reports on the non - sarcomagenic character of v - erbB isolates with a complete C - terminus . Truncations of at least 23 car - boxy terminal amino acids of the chicken c - erbB seemed to be required for inducing sarcoma 87 - 89 . On the other hand , signals transmitted by the complete EGFR may cooperate with otherwise non - sarcomagenic nuclear oncogenes and lead to tumorigenic growth of fibroblasts 85 . This obser - vation may in part explain the apparently contra - dictory reports on the tumorigenic properties of EGF or TGF - a expressing established rodent cell lines 90 , 91 , suggesting that cooperative nuclear events 92 might have been overlooked in these cell lines . It is now understood that changes in the intracel - lular region of the EGFR not only induce ligand in - dependent activation of the EGFR but also change substrate recognition by EGFR kinase . Removal of the carboxy terminal tail of the EGFR significantly broadened the spectrum of cellular substrates for EGF dependent tyrosine phosphorylation 93 . Similar truncations markedly impaired EGF de - pendent increase of inositol phosphate formation in NIH3T3 cells 20 and the EGF dependent activa - tion of phospholipase A2 in CHO cells expressing ectopic human EGFR 94 . Even a single amino acid substitution , threonine for arginine at position 662 in the juxtamembrane domain , was sufficient to change both the pattern of intracellular proteins phosphorylated and mitogenic behavior of differ - ent transfected established cell lines in response to EGF 95 . Therefore the v - erbB oncogenes as well as truncated or mutated forms of the EGFR may be more than constitutively activated EGFR mole - cules , and can be expected to have distinct and nov - el properties . 4 . 1 . 2 . Aberrant activation in TGF - c ~ transgenic mice Paracrine , autocrine , and more recently adhesion activation of EGFR have been the focus of atten - tion for developmental biologists and tumor biol - ogists , attempting to explain controlled as well as self propagating mechanisms for growth , develop - ment , and neoplasia . Experiments with transgenic mice suggest that an autocrine mechanism involving the EGFR could be expected to play a role in the initiation and / or pro - gression of mammary and hepatocellular carcino - ma as well as pancreatic hyperplasia 96 , 86 . Trans - genic mice expressing TGF - cz were reported to de - velop hepatic carcinoma and abnormal breast tis - sue . Mammary carcinomas were observed in the post lactating gland . Evidently none of these neo - plias required amplification or truncation of the EGFR , but rather depended on the paracrine acti - vation of the endogenous receptor ( and perhaps complementing nuclear and / or environmental events ) . Transgenic mice over - expressing TGF - o ~ specifi - cally in the stratified squamous epithelia , devel - oped thicker epidermis and stunted hair growth as well as benign papillomas in regions of mechanical irritation or wounding . Areas of the skin that were subjected to mild irritation displayed localized leu - kocytic infiltration and granular layer loss , charac - teristic of psoriasis in humans 97 . These observa - tions are in agreement with those made on human cells , where an interplay of EGFR autocrine activ - ity and IGF - I receptor activity is believed to pro - mote the appearance of psoriatic lesions 98 , 99 , and in other instances promote skin carcinogenesis 100 - 102 . Interestingly , murine epidermal cells may be equally responsive to EGF as to other classi - cal chemical tumor promoters such as 12 - O - tetrade - canoylphorboM3 - acetate ( TPA ) for neoplastic transformation 103 - 105 . 4 . 2 . Involvement of EGFR in human tumors In the following sections we shall survey the evi - dence concerning the involvement of EGFR in hu - man mammary carcinoma , which so far is the most intensively investigated human cancer in connec - tion with EGFR . Other epithelial tumors will not be discussed in detail but only refered to . Glioblasto - ma , a non - epithelial tumor and the only human can - cer where truncation and over - expression of EGFR may play an important role , is briefly reviewed . The mechanism by which EGFR may contribute to ma - lignant transformation or progression of epithelial cells is not limited to mitogenic stimulation but is likely to involve a variety of cellular responses that have been associated with cellular migration and in - vasiveness . These will be discussed in the context of mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis . 4 . 2 . 1 . EGFR and mammary carcinoma In human breast carcinoma a strong inverse corre - lation between the expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and EGFR [ 106 - 109 ; also see review : 110 ] as well as between EGFR and ER plus progesterone receptor ( PR ) [ 111 - 118 ] has been established . In hu - man breast carcinomas the percentage of EGFR positive tumors reported in the literature varies from 22 % to 67 % [ 117 ] . Differences in assay meth - odology , tumor biopsy sample selection and cut - off level seem to offer plausible explanations for this variation . In addition , endogenous TGFc ~ may lead to the occupation of EGFR ligand binding domain and receptor downregrulation resulting in underes - timations of receptor number when analysed by re - ceptor binding [ 119 ] . EGFR expression , particular - ly in ER negative patients [ 107 ] has been a marker of morphological and functional de - differentiation related to a poor prognosis [ 106 , 109 , 111 , 113 , 115 , 117 ] . Expression of EGFR in ER negative / EGFR pos - itive tumors was reported to be heterogeneous , sup - porting the existence of subsets of tumor cells with differential aggressive potentials [ 118 , 119 ] . Further - more it was demonstrated that expression of the EGFR in breast tumor metastases is frequently ele - vated compared to the primary tumor [ 106 , 109 ] , which suggests involvement of EGFR in the meta - static process . Recent reports indicate that cross - talk between EGFR and ER or PR in the mammary gland may have important consequences on the regulation of normal and aberrant growth . Elevated and some - times estrogen inducible expression of TGF - cz has been reported in both human and experimental mammary cancers as well as mammary tumor cell lines [ for review see : 120 , 121 ] . In cultured human 261 breast tumor cell lines expressing constitutively either ER and EGFR [ 122 ] or ER plus a transfected EGFR [ 123 ] a heterospecific receptor modulation could be identified . Thus the simultaneous induc - tion of ER and EGFR signal transduction in these cells was not tolerated . Prolonged cultivation of EGFR plus ER expressing cells with EGF resulted in loss of estrogen - dependent proliferation , despite the presence of high amounts of ER [ 123 ] . Further - more , prolonged cultivation of these cells with ta - moxifen resulted in anti - hormone resistant sub - clones expressing EGFR but lacking ER and PR [ 122 , 123 ] . It remains to be established if this observ - ed unresponsiveness or down - regulation of ER in EGFR expressing cultured mammary tumors dur - ing antiestrogen treatment could contribute to the failure of endocrine treatment in the clinic . 4 . 2 . 2 . Involvement of EGFR in other epithelial ma - lignancies A number of other epithelial malignancies have ( through experimental observation and or clinical correlations ) been linked with EGFR function . The most convincing of these are hepatic carcinoma , where an interaction of TGF - ~ / TGF - [ 3 signal trans - duction pathways may play a key role [ 124126 ] and prostatic hyperplasia / cancer [ for reviews see : 127 , 128 ] . Other epithelial carcinomas associated with EGFR activity include renal carcinoma [ 129 , 130 ] , bladder cancer [ 131 ] , epithelial malignancies de - rived from human oral tissue [ 132 ] , laryngeal cancer [ 133 ] , oesophageal tumors [ 134 - 136 ] , stomach can - cer [ 137 ] , colon carcinoma [ 138 , 139 ] , ovarian ade - nocarcinomas [ 140 ] , and lung cancer [ 141 , 142 ] . 4 . 2 . 3 . Truncations of EGFR in glioblastoma Glioblastoma is the only human cancer so far causa - tively linked to expression of truncated EGFR . Amplification and rearrangement of the EGFR lo - cus are also common features , and therefore pre - sumably constitutive over - activity of the receptor is involved [ 143 - 146 ] . However the extent to which mutations and truncations other than those affect - ing the extracellular domain , may contribute to the onset of glioblastoma is not sufficiently document - ed . Characteristic rearrangements of the EGFR gene in glioblastoma give rise to novel antigenic 262 epitopes . An antibody made to the rearranged se - quences of the EGFR in glioblastoma multiforme , the most malignant of human primary brain tumors , was shown to react with rearranged EGFRs in sev - eral patients with the same particular EGFR dele - tion mutation , demonstrating the potential use of common antibodies for diagnosis and treatment 147 . 5 . EGFR and mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis Metastatic spread of tumors is a consequence of a series of events in which growth factors could be in - volved . Sequentially , tumor cells must proliferate , loose their anchorage dependence on the extracel - lular matrix ( ECM ) and their contacts with neigh - boring cells , pass through the vessel wall , enter the blood stream , seed the target organ and form a new colony 148 - 150 . During all these processes , tumor cells are submitted to a variety of environmental controls including growth factors from the host or from the tumor itself , as well as various substrates in contact with cells . EGF and TGF ~ are well known for their growth stimulating effects in a wide variety of systems . Accumulating evidence is presented that these growth factors have pleiotropic effects on cell motility , chemotaxis , secretion and differentia - tion which in some cases correlate with metastatic potential . 5 . 1 . Effects of EGF on tumor growth Besides the well known stimulatory effect , activa - tion of EGFR can inhibit growth of cells in tissue culture depending on the cell type , the number of receptors and the assay conditions . This may ex - plain occasional discrepancies in correlating the re - sponse of tumor cells to EGF in vitro with their re - sponse to EGF after transplantation into host ani - mals . 5 . 1 . 1 . Differential effects of EGF on growth of cultur - ed cells It has been shown that the effect of EGF on cell pro - liferation is dependent on the quantity of occupied EGFR and that occupation of additional EGFR in excess led to decreased growth stimulation and even to an inhibition of cells grown in monolayer tissue culture 151 , 152 . However , the growth of hu - man epidermoid A431 cells expressing high num - bers of EGFR ( 2 x 106 / cells ) was inhibited by EGF in monolayer culture , while it was stimulated under 3 - dimensional culture conditions 153 . Further - more , under tissue culture conditions the degree of cell - cell contacts may determine if EGF and TGF ~ induce either mitogenic or inhibitory signals as demonstrated with a human renal adenocarcinoma cell line 154 . 5 . 1 . 2 . Xenotransplants of EGFR expressing tumors in immune deficient mice A clear correlation between tumor growth and EGFR expression could be demonstrated in tumor xenografts . A relationship between a high number of EGFR and the tumorigenic potential in nude mice has been described for the human A431 cells 155 , human mammary MDA 468 cells 156 and a feline mammary carcinoma 152 . Ozawa 134 showed that growth rates of A431 human epidermal xenografts were markedly enhanced by EGF sup - plied by implanted osmotic pumps . Surgical remov - al of the submaxillary glands , a major source of EGF in male mice , decreased tumor growth rates in animals bearing transplanted mammary cancer 157 or human squamous cell carcinoma 158 . This inhibitory effect was reversed by supplying exog - enous EGE Implants of a human EGFR - expressing melanoma line in scid mice metastasized spontane - ously to multiple distant sites . Resection of the pri - mary tumor followed by the application of an EGFR specific MAb resulted in suppressed growth of established micrometastases 159 . Furthermore , an EGFR specific MAb inhibited growth of human epidermoid cells when transplanted subcutaneous - ly , intravenously or into the peritoneum of nude mice 160 . Moreover , the antitumor effect persist - ed when animals were treated with the F ( ab ) ' 2 frag - ment of the antibody suggesting that the antitumor effect was not due to immune mechanisms . 5 . 2 . The effects of EG F on metastasis in experimental systems 5 . 2 . 1 . Syngeneic animal models in which metastatic capability correlates with growth factor responsive - ness Tumor cells have been shown to demonstrate in vit - ro proliferative responses to defined growth fac - tors , such as platelet - derived growth factor , insulin - like growth factor , EGF and others . The ability to proliferate when stimulated with growth factors correlates in some systems with the metastatic capa - bility of the malignant cells as was shown in the mouse colon adenocarcinoma 26 for IGF - 1 [ 161 ] and in the 13762NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma system for transferrin [ 162 ] and EGF [ 163 ] . 5 . 2 . 2 . Syngeneic animal models in which metastatic capacity is enhanced by EGF In the rat rhabdomysarcoma ( RMS ) 9 - - 4 / 0 system , treatment of cultured tumor cells with 20 ng / ml EGF for 48 hours enhanced the lung colonising po - tential of i . v . injected tumor cells significantly [ 164 ] . In addition , tumor growth in the mediastinal lym - phatic tissue was observed in rats receiving EGF - treated cells . Furthermore , treatment of rats with EGF following ablation of the primary tumor re - sulted in a dramatic increase in the median number of spontaneous lung metastases , and high incidence of axillary lymph node and extrapulmonary ( mediastinal ) metastases as compared to saline treated animals . While this study clearly demon - strates that EGF can enhance the metastatic poten - tial of EGFR expressing tumors , it does not allow discrimination between the effects of EGF on the tumor cells or those on the host . In order to elucidate this question , closely related tumor cell clones with different metastatic potential and different levels of EGFR expression have to be used . Introduction of the gene for EGFR into the receptor negative clone should then confer meta - static capability to this cell clone . In order to per - form these studies we have chosen clones MTC and MTLn3 from the 13762 NF rat mammary adenocar - cinoma and introduced the gene for the human EGFR into low metastatic clone MTC . Our initial observations suggest that in this model system ex - 263 pression of EGFR may be a determining factor for metastasis of the tumor cells from the mammary fat pad to their target organ , the lungs . 5 . 3 . Effects of EGF on specific steps of the metastatic cascade While definitive experimental proof is still lacking that EGFR is involved in spontaneous metastasis , there are some indications that EGF can enhance the ability of cells to succeed in some steps of the metastatic cascade . Recent reviews have discussed in detail the basic mechanisms of tumor cell adhe - sion , invasion and motility [ 165 , 166 ] . Here we will concentrate on examples where stimulation of EGFR increased the potency of cells to succeed in these important steps of the metastatic cascade . 5 . 3 . 1 . Influence of EGF on the integrin receptor fam - ily , their ligands and adhesion to ECM Early work by Briles and Kornfeld [ 167 ] had indi - cated a correlation between tumor cell adherence to extracellular matrix proteins ( ECM ) in vitro and increased lung colonising potential of intravenously injected tumor cells . Subsequently the importance of cellular adhesion in lung colonising potential has been well documented by using closely related tu - mor cell clones of defined adhesive and metastatic properties [ for reviews see : 149 , 150 ] . Recently the integrins were identified as the ma - jor family of receptors by which cells attach to ECM . Accumulating data indicate that EGFR may directly influence the expression , organisation and function of the integrins . It has been known for a long time that EGF induces rapid changes in the in - teraction of tumor cells with their own ECM or de - fined matrices . For example , in the case of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells it was observed that within minutes of exposure to this factor , the cells undergo rapid morphological changes result - ing in retraction of the cells from the tissue culture substrata as they become significantly more round - ed [ 168 - 170 ] and exhibit membrane ruffling , and ill - opodia [ 171 , 172 ] . When A431 cells where plated on - to collagen , addition of EGF did not interfere with attachment but modulated spreading of ceils [ 169 ] . 264 This effect was inhibited by cytochalasin B , a com - pound which interferes with the actin - associated microfilament system , indicating dissociation of linked integrin - cytoskeleton interaction . Our group recently described that EGF increased with - in 5 minutes adhesion of highly metastatic rat mam - mary adenocarcinoma cell clone MTLn3 to fibro - nectin . Treatment of closely related mammary ade - nocarcinoma cell lines with EGF enhanced lung colonising potential only when the cells expressed EGFR ( Lichtner et al . , in preparation ) . Recently evidence has been provided that EGFR activation can influence the interaction of cells with defined matrix components , by modulating the sub - unit organisation of the integrins . For example , en - terocyte sheet migration was stimulated by EGF on laminin but not on collagen I or fibronectin , indicat - ing modulation of a specific integrin subunit 173 . Indeed , integrin c ~ 1 subunit pools were decreased after EGF treatment on collagen - I but increased on laminin . The EGF induced changes in immunreac - tivity required protein synthesis since they were in - hibited by cylcoheximide . This is in line with a re - port 174 , that in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells EGF in - duced rapid increase in vinculin and ~ l - integrin mRNA levels . Elucidation of the mechanism by which EGF affects integrin organisation and pool size awaits better understanding of the mechanisms which modulate integrins . In this respect it is of con - siderable interest , that the integrin 3 subunit con - tains in its intracellular domain a tyrosine residue whose neighboring sequences show high degree of homology with the tyrosine autophosphorylation site of the EGFR 175 . Perhaps critical interaction of integrins are influenced by EGFR mediated phosphorylation of these residues . However , EGFR mediated phosphorylation of integrins does not seem to happen in human KB cells 176 , and may be dependent on the cell type investigated . Several integrin subunits are phosphorylated up - on binding to ECM , suggesting that in addition to providing adhesive interactions with immobilised ECM proteins , integrins also modulate transmis - sion of intracellular signals 177 - 180 . Moreover transient tyrosine phosphorylation of protein ( s ) of 130 - 150 kd has been observed in KB carcinoma cells following cross linking of ~ 3131 integrins 176 . In mouse fibroblasts adhesion and spreading on fi - bronectin led to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of similar size , termed focal adhesion kinase and suggested to be a component in the putative in - tegrin signalling pathway 181 , 182 . It has been pos - tulated that integrins may even share some of the intracellular signal transduction pathways of tyro - sine kinase receptors for reviews see : 183 , 184 . Integrins have been recognised not only as sys - tems to provide adhesive strength by interaction with immobilised ECM proteins , but also as sys - tems which aid the cell in recognising and respon - ding to environmental signals . EGFR activity has been reported to induce the production and secre - tion of matrix proteins in several cell lines . In - creased secretion of fibronectin was reported for normal rat liver cells 185 , and of fibronectin and laminin for the human breast cancer cell line PMC42 186 . In the latter study EGF induced in - creased production of matrix proteins might have been causative for the increased adherence of cul - tured PMC42 cell organoids . The modulation of in - tegrin function as well as production / secretion of ECM proteins by EGFR could have significant bi - ological consequences , making the EGFR system perhaps a key regulator of the cellular response to the microenvironment . 5 . 3 . 2 . Influence of EGFR on cell - cell contact and cy - toskeleton Recent reports have opened the possibility that EGFR activity may also directly influence cell - cell contact , another critical parameter known to define epithelial invasiveness 188 . Both EGFR and E - cadherins were shown to co - localise in the basolat - eral membrane of A431 cells 189 . Changes in the level of expression of E - cadherin or tyrosine phos - phorylation of the associated protein ~ - catenin , in MDCK epithelial cell line were shown to lead to rapid loss of cell - cell contact , acquisition of fibro - blastoid morphology and invasive phenotype 190 , 191 ; for reviews see ; 192 , 193 . Direct phosphoryla - tion of ~ - catenin by EGFR or contact of EGFR with transmembrane TGF - ~ or EGF on neighbor - ing cells are possible mechanisms that may relate to the role of EGFR in the acquisition of invasive properties . We had reported recently that EGFRs localise preferentially in the cell - cell contact areas of A431 cells and that negative control mechanisms pre - venting EGFR activation may be exerted by adja - cent cells 194 . However , in detergent - permeabil - ized cells the cytoskeleton - associated EGFRs were fully active . It is of interest that in the highly meta - static mammary adenocarcinoma clone MTLn3 , cy - toskeleton - associated EGFRs are highly suscepti - ble to phosphorylation in permeabilized cells , while in intact cells mitogenic stimulation occurs without detectable receptor phosphorylation 19 . A number of recent studies indicate that EGFR , is itself in part associated with the cytoskeleton 194 - 196 . Furthermore , a number of cytoskeletal components have been shown to be phosphorylat - ed in vivo and in vitro by EGFR kinase , such as fo - drin , spectrin , tubulin and microtubulin associated protein 2 , ezrin and lipocortin 1 196 , 197 , 199 . Cy - toskeletal associated EGFRs may have specialised functions since they are mainly of the high affinity class 196 , 197 , 200 . It has been proposed that activation of PI3 - ki - nase , which occurs through association with tyro - sine kinase receptors , may directly influence actin filament reorganisation . However , due to the low affinity of EGFR for PI3 - kinase , overexpression of this receptor may be needed to allow for these events for review see : 22 . 5 . 3 . 3 . Effects of EGF on cell motility Another parameter often associated with epithelial invasiveness is motility for reviews see : 192 , 193 , 201 - 203 . Cell motility requires several distinct steps that must occur in a coordinated fashion for cellular translocation to occur . Following the estab - lishment of adhesion to the underlying substratum , the cell must be able to form protrusions , establish - ing new adhesions and be able to break older ad - hesions for translocation to occur for review see : 165 . In order to clearly demonstrate an effect of EGF on cell motility it had to be separated from its effect on cellular growth . This has been demonstrated in several cell lines grown in tissue culture , such as rat intestinal epithelium cells 204 , the human em - 265 bryonal carcinoma cell line Tera - 2 205 , and ker - atinocytes 206 for review see : 202 . Similarly , the human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells 207 or hu - man glioma line K - 343 M6a 172 showed relatively high motility and grew dispersely as single cells when cultured with EGE while in the absence of EGF cells grew in clusters . The migration and spread of closely related human glioma cells from spheroids on a plastic substratum was increased by EGF 208 . 5 . 3 . 4 . Effects of EGF on the production ~ release of ECM degradative enzymes and on invasion Many different types of ECM degradative enzymes have been implicated in invasion by metastatic cells , such as metalloproteinases , aminopeptidases , serine proteinases , cysteine proteinases and aspar - tic proteinases for reviews see : 209 , 210 . EGF has been shown , among other growth factors and cyto - kines , to modulate the level of cell - secreted serine proteinases and metalloproteinases . In human squamous cell carcinoma , EGF influences plasmi - nogen activator - mediated proteolysis of ECM 211 . In lung and colon carcinoma EGF induced the syn - thesis of urokinase type plasminogen activator ac - tivity ( uPA ) 212 , 213 and in normal fibroblasts of collagenase respectively 214 . In mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines EGF dependent secre - tion of proteinases was correlated with the meta - static properties of the cell lines 215 . Expression of transfected TGFa in a rat bladder carcinoma cell line resulted in highly mobile cells which produced a gelatinolytic activity not normally synthesized by untransfected or control neo transfected cells 216 . In RL 95 - 2 human endometrial adenosquamous carcinoma cells , EGF stimulated an increase in uPA 217 . In three cell lines with similar numbers of EGFR established from one patient with maxillary tumor , only one line responded to EGF with increased in - vasiveness into fibrin gels 218 . Subsequent analy - sis revealed that in this particular EGF - responsive cell line the production of the proteinase inhibitors PAI - 1 and TIMP was increased while the produc - tion of type IV collagenase and membrane bound PA were unaltered . 266 6 . Conclusions 1 . Expression of the EGFR , in contrast to initial expectations , is not restricted to a specific cellu - lar lineage but has been observed in a variety of different cell types throughout development . 2 . Biological functions of EGFR are equally varia - ble , ranging from providing signals for survival or terminal differentiation to inducing mitogenic response , cell motility , and invasion . 3 . EGFR activity has been shown to initiate or con - tribute to progression of neoplasia in a wide range of experimental systems ( cultured cells , retrovirally infected birds , rodent tumor model systems , and transgenic mice ) . 4 . In human malignancies , truncations or muta - tions of EGFR are rare events with exception of glioblastoma . This contrasts with the frequent deletions observed in the transduced EGFR genes of avian oncogenic retroviruses . 5 . In various human epithelial malignancies ex - pression of EGFR is associated with tumor pro - gression . In such carcinomas , paracrine or auto - crine activation of EGFR seems to be a common means of promoting growth and / or dissemina - tion . 6 . In human mammary tumors , an inverse correla - tion between expression of EGFR and ER in - dicates involvement of EGFR in tumor progres - sion . Interactions of EGFR and ER were also implicated in TGFa transgenic animals , leading to development of mammary carcinoma . 7 . EGF may support metastatic capacity of tumor cells by enhancing their ability to succeed in spe - cific steps of the metastatic cascade such as in - vasion , lodgement , extravasation , cell locomo - tion and growth in distant organs . The pleiotrop - ic effects of EGFR on cellular cytoskeletal reor - ganisation , adhesion , motility , expression and activation of proteases may be in many circum - stances a key to the success of cancer as a lethal disease . 8 . Future research should further elucidate the sig - naling pathways that are affected by EGFR and that can lead to transformation and / or tumor progression . Clarification is also needed with re - gard to the role of other tyrosine kinase recep - tors and of specific domains in these processes . Acknowledgements Dr . D . Henderson ( Schering A .
