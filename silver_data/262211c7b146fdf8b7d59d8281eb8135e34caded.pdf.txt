In erythroid cells , the locus control region ( LCR ) contacts b - type globin genes in a developmental stage - speciﬁc manner to stimulate transcription . Previously , we induced LCR - promoter looping by tethering the self - associa - tion domain ( SA ) of Ldb1 to the b - globin promoter via artiﬁcial zinc ﬁngers . Here , we show that targeting the SA to a developmentally silenced embryonic globin gene in adult murine erythroblasts triggers its transcriptional reactivation . This activity depends on the LCR , consistent with an LCR - promoter loop - ing mechanism . Strikingly , targeting the SA to the fetal g - globin promoter in primary adult human eryth - roblasts increases g - globin promoter - LCR contacts , stimulating transcription to approximately 85 % of total b - globin synthesis , with a reciprocal reduction in adult b - globin expression . Our ﬁndings demon - strate that forced chromatin looping can override a stringent developmental gene expression program and suggest a novel approach to control the balance of globin gene transcription for therapeutic applications . INTRODUCTION Long - range enhancers physically contact their target promoters to form chromatin loops . The b - globin locus has been at the fore - front of studies on the dynamics and mechanisms of chromatin looping and gene regulation . In erythroid cells , a powerful distal enhancer called the locus control region ( LCR ) , composed of multiple DNase I hypersensitive sites ( HSs ) , is in physical prox - imity to the b - globin genes in a developmentally dynamic manner ( Carter et al . , 2002 ; Tolhuis et al . , 2002 ) . In primitive murine erythroid cells , the LCR loops to the embryonic - type b - globin gene promoters ( ε y and b h1 ) , whereas in deﬁnitive erythroid cells , the LCR exclusively contacts the adult - type b - globin genes ( b - major and b - minor ) , with the intervening embryonic globin genes looped out ( Palstra et al . , 2003 ) . Humans additionally bear fetal stage - speciﬁc b - like globin ( g - globin ) genes that con - tact the LCR and are transcribed from the beginning of fetal liver erythropoiesis until birth when blood formation gradually shifts to the bone marrow . Several transcription factors have been impli - cated in loop formation at the b - globin locus , including Klf1 , GATA1 , and its coregulators Ldb1 and FOG1 ( Drissen et al . , 2004 ; Song et al . , 2007 ; Vakoc et al . , 2005 ) . In previous work we addressed whether any of these factors might be sufﬁcient for chromatin looping and whether looping is a causal event dur - ing transcription initiation or merely a reﬂection of it ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) . Speciﬁcally , in immature murine erythroblasts in which the b - globin promoter is not in contact with the LCR , tethering of Ldb1 to the promoter via artiﬁcial zinc - ﬁnger ( ZF ) proteins estab - lished an LCR - promoter loop similar to that observed in mature erythroid cells and stimulated transcription ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) . The self - association ( SA ) domain of Ldb1 was sufﬁcient for this activity . These results demonstrated that forced juxtaposition of an enhancer and promoter via chromatin looping can trigger gene activation and identiﬁed a relatively small functional domain of Ldb1 as a powerful mediator of such long - range inter - actions . Therefore , it should be possible to activate any other similarly regulated nearby gene by producing an interaction be - tween it and the active LCR . The molecular mechanisms mediating the developmental switch in globin gene expression have been widely investigated . A variety of nuclear complexes contribute to the silencing of the Cell 158 , 849 – 860 , August 14 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 849 embryonic and fetal globin genes in adult erythroid cells ( San - karan et al . , 2010 ) . Among these , arguably the most powerful one is nucleated by Bcl11a ( Sankaran et al . , 2008 , 2009 ) , which does not bind directly to promoters of the silenced human fetal globin genes but seems to repress them via a mechanism involving higher - order chromatin looping ( Kiefer et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2010 ) . Hence , manipulating chromatin loops might be a viable strategy to reverse the globin switch . The overarching in - terest in these questions stems in part from the clinical impor - tance of understanding hemoglobin switching . Patients affected by sickle cell anemia and b - thalassemia experience a milder course of the disease if they express elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin in adulthood ( Platt et al . , 1994 ; Weatherall , 2001 ) . This observation in particular provided a major impetus for studies over the last decades aimed at unraveling the mecha - nisms by which the fetal globin genes are silenced with the ulti - mate goal of reactivating their expression . Here , we tested whether developmentally silenced embryonic or fetal globin genes can be reactivated in adult erythroid cells by juxtaposing them with the LCR and whether reactivation would lead to a concomitant reduction in the adult - type globin genes . We found that ZF mediated tethering of the SA domain of Ldb1 to the murine embryonic b h1 - globin promoter activated tran - scription in an adult - type erythroblast cell line and primary deﬁn - itive erythroid cells . This activity was abrogated in erythroid cells from mice in which the LCR had been deleted , demonstrating that embryonic globin gene activation was dependent on a long - range LCR interaction . Primary human erythroid cells ex - pressing the SA domain fused to a ZF moiety that targets the g - globin promoters produced high quantities of g - globin mRNA and protein in the vast majority of cells with an accompa - nying reduction in adult - type globin expression . The reciprocal alteration in fetal versus adult globin gene transcription was re - ﬂected in corresponding changes in contact frequencies with the LCR . Together , these studies demonstrate that stringent develop - mental regulation of a gene can be overcome through the manipulation of higher - order chromatin structure and that such manipulations have the potential for therapeutic applications . RESULTS b h1 - SA - Mediated Activation of an Embryonic Globin Gene in Adult Erythroblasts To examine the potential of forced gene looping in reprogram - ming the b - globin locus , we began by using G1E erythroblasts . G1E is a murine adult - type erythroid cell line that lacks the erythroid transcription factor GATA1 ( Weiss et al . , 1997 ) . As a result , a productive interaction between the LCR and the adult b - globin ( b - major ) promoter fails to form , and b - major mRNA production is low ( Vakoc et al . , 2005 ) . GATA1 deﬁciency is asso - ciated with little to no Ldb1 recruitment to the promoter ( Tripic et al . , 2009 ) . Tethering Ldb1 or its SA domain to the b - major pro - moter restored looping in a manner highly similar to that in normal erythroid cells or G1E cells upon GATA1 restoration ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we asked whether a similar approach could be employed to achieve a distinct goal , which is to activate the embryonic b h1 - globin gene by tethering the Ldb1 SA domain to its promoter to induce an interaction with the LCR ( Figure 1A ) . We designed custom ZF proteins and screened them for binding to b h1 - globin promoter sequences in vitro ( see the Experimental Procedures ) . Functional proteins were fused to the SA domain of Ldb1 ( b h1 - SA ) and introduced into G1E cells by retroviral infec - tion . Infected cells were isolated by ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) revealed speciﬁc binding of b h1 - SA to the b h1 - globin promoter , but not to the promoters of the other b - like globin genes ( Figure 1B ) . We observed a low but reproducible ChIP signal at the DNase 1 hypersensitive ( HS ) sites of the LCR , likely due to b h1 - SA bind - ing to endogenous Ldb1 - containing complexes ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) . We next examined the effects of b h1 - SA on b h1 - globin transcription by qRT - PCR . b h1 - globin mRNA levels were increased 368 - fold over nonexpressing G1E cells or cells that express a ZF protein targeting HS2 of the LCR ( L - SA ) ( Figure 1C ) . Restoration of GATA1 activity in G1E cells via expression of an estradiol - inducible form of GATA1 ( GATA1 - ER ) leads to erythroid maturation and high - level induction of b - major transcription , as well as low - level induction of b h1 - globin ( Figures 1C and 1D ) ( Weiss et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 2004 ) . Hence , we investigated whether b h1 - SA expression was capable of raising b h1 - globin transcription in differentiating b - major producing erythroid cells . Notably , b h1 - SA induced b h1 - globin levels 26 - fold over control cells , amounting to (cid:1) 15 % of total b - globin expression compared to (cid:1) 0 . 5 % in vector only containing cells ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Tethering the SA domain to the LCR ( L - SA in Figure 1 ) or b - major promoter ( Dengetal . , 2012 ; datanotshown ) didnotactivate b h1 - globin expression , conﬁrming that the effects of b h1 - SA are spe - ciﬁc . Basal - level b h1 - globin expression and b h1 - SA - induced b h1 - globin transcription were higher in GATA1 replete cells when compared to parental G1E cells , likely due to increased LCR and promoter activities in the presence of GATA1 ( Fig - ure S1A available online ) . The substantial increase in b h1 - globin expression was associated with a trend toward lower b - major expression ( see also below ) but without signiﬁcant changes of other erythroid genes , including those encoding a - globin and Kit , indicating that the effects of b h1 - SA are not simply a conse - quence of differentiation induction ( Figures 1D and S1B ) . b h1 - SA - Mediated Activation of Embryonic Globin Gene Expression in Primary Adult Erythroblasts To address whether b h1 - SA activates expression of b h1 - globin in murine primary erythroid cells , we isolated immature deﬁnitive ( adult - type ) erythroid progenitor cells from E13 . 5 wild - type fetal livers by sorting for CD71 medium / low and Ter119 low popula - tions ( S0 cells ) as described previously ( Figure 2A ) ( Pop et al . , 2010 ) . Cells were infected with a retroviral vector expressing b h1 - SA ( infection rate > 75 % ; data not shown ) and expanded for 48 hr , followed by measurements of transcript levels by RT - qPCR ( reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reac - tion ) . b h1 - SA activated b h1 - globin transcription by almost 800 - fold compared to empty vector control ( Figure 2B ) , exceeding 30 % of total b - globin synthesis ( Figure 2C ) . We noted that the zinc ﬁnger alone also raised b h1 - globin expression but only to (cid:1) 1 / 6 of the levels achieved by b h1 - SA ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . Although the cause for this activity is unclear , we surmise that zinc - ﬁnger binding might increase chromatin occupancy of 850 Cell 158 , 849 – 860 , August 14 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . A B C D Figure 1 . Reactivation of the Silenced b h1 - Globin Gene in Adult Erythroid Cells by the Tethered Ldb1 SA Domain ( A ) Experimental strategy . In normal adult erythroid cells , Ldb1 is part of a multiprotein complex at the LCR and the b - major ( b maj ) promoter and con - tributes to LCR - b - major contacts . Zinc - ﬁnger - mediated tethering of the SA domain of Ldb1 to the b h1 - globin promoter might juxtapose the b h1 - globin promoter to the LCR at the expense of the b - major - LCR interaction .

We also examined the ability of b h1 - SA to increase b h1 - globin expression in erythroblasts that are further differentiated ( S1 populations ) and obtained similar results ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Importantly , b - major expression was slightly reduced in both b h1 - SA - expressing populations ( Figures 2B and S2A ) , consistent with the idea that b h1 - SA recruits the LCR toward the b h1 - globin gene at the expense of the b - major gene . We noted that b h1 - SA impaired expression of a few erythroid spe - ciﬁc genes , such as those encoding Band3 , AHSP , and Alas2 ( Figure S2C ) . Because these genes are in part regulated by pro - moter proximal Ldb1 - containing transcription factor complexes ( Tripic et al . , 2009 ) , b h1 - SA likely inﬂuences their expression in a dominant - negative fashion , especially when expressed very highly ( data not shown ) . However , in human erythroblasts , SA - fusion proteins did not inhibit the orthologous genes ( see below ) , which might be due to species - speciﬁc effects and / or lower expression levels . Nevertheless , these events do not substan - tially impact overall erythroid maturation and a - globin gene expression , indicating that b h1 - globin activation is gene speciﬁc and not the result of global differentiation induction . Interestingly , the embryonic globin gene ε y , which is located closer to the LCR than the b h1 gene , was also activated to some degree by b h1 - SA expression in both S0 and S1 erythroid precursor cells ( Figure S2D ) . Since b h1 - SA does not detectably bind to the ε y - globin gene promoter ( Figure 1B ) , this suggests that bringing the LCR closer into the vicinity of the ε y - globin gene increases its likelihood of expression . In sum , recruitment of the Ldb1 SA domain to the b h1 - globin promoter is capable of substantially antagonizing the stringent A B C Ter119 - APC CD 71 - PE 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % % of total globin maj h1 h1 - SA h1 - ZF Ctrl 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Fo l d c h a ng e h1 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 Fo l d c h a ng e maj h1 - SA h1 - ZF Ctrl h1 - SA h1 - ZF Ctrl S0 S1 S2 S3 Figure 2 .

See also Figure S2 . developmental silencing mechanisms operational in deﬁnitive murine erythroid cells . If a similar degree of reactivation of fetal globin genes could be achieved in adult human erythroid cells , this would be highlytherapeuticallyrelevant ( Platt , 2008 ) . b h1 - SA Activation of b h1 - Globin Expression Is LCR Dependent Based on our prior studies showing that tethering of Ldb1 to the b - globin promoter triggers looping ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) , the mechanism by which b h1 - SA activates gene expression most likely also involves pro - moting proximity between the b h1 - globin gene and the LCR . To test this directly , we carried out chromosome conformation cap - ture ( 3C ) experiments in G1E cells expressing b h1 - SA . However , the relatively short genomic distance between the LCR and the b h1 - globin gene as well as the intervening ε y - globin gene pro - duced high basal - level 3C signals . Moreover , because the acti - vation of b h1 - globin expression ranged around 15 % of total b - globin synthesis , the signal - to - noise ratio of the 3C experi - ments was not high enough to allow reliable detection of changes in contact frequencies ( data not shown ) . As an alterna - tive approach , we carried out genetic experiments using erythroid cells from mice lacking the LCR ( D LCR ) that contain a transgenic human b - globin locus to support erythropoiesis ( Bender et al . , 2000 ) ( Figure 3A ) . If long - range LCR looping underlies b h1 - SA function , the LCR deletion should impair b h1 - SA activity . If , on the other hand , b h1 - SA bypasses the requirement for the LCR by functioning locally as a strong tran - scriptional activator , its activity should be independent of the LCR ( Figures 1A and 3A ) . b h1 - SA was introduced into primary erythroid precursor cells ( S0 populations , gated as in Figure 2A ) isolated from E13 . 5 fetal livers derived from mice homozygous for the LCR deletion . Although the loss of the LCR had no impact on basal level b h1 - globin transcription , it completely abrogated the induction of b h1 - globin expression seen in the wild - type mice ( Figure 3B ) . As expected , b - major expression in the D LCR cells was low when compared with wild - type cells ( Figure 3C ) . Transcription of the a - globin gene that resides on a different chromosome was unaffected by the LCR deletion ( Figure 3D ) . Adventitious 852 Cell 158 , 849 – 860 , August 14 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . activation of ε y - globin expression was also abrogated in the absence of the LCR ( Figure S3A ) , consistent with a model in which the LCR can form productive sporadic contacts with nearby genes ( Noordermeer et al . , 2011 ) . Similar results were obtained using puriﬁed S1 cell populations ( Figure S3B ) . In conclusion , b h1 - SA - mediated activation of b h1 - globin transcrip - tion requires the LCR and , by extension , is dependent on chro - matin looping . 3C experiments carried out in human erythroid cells further support the concept that zinc - ﬁnger SA fusion pro - teins alter chromosome looping ( see below ) . Zinc Finger - SA - Mediated Activation of g - Globin Transcription in Primary Adult Human Erythroid Cells We next explored whether the strategy of forced chromatin loop - ing could be employed to activate g - globin expression in adult human erythroid cells ( Figure 4A ) . To tether the Ldb1 SA domain to the two highly similar G g - globin and A g - globin genes , we fused it to a previously characterized artiﬁcial zinc - ﬁnger protein ( called GG1 ) that targets both promoters ( Gra¨slund et al . , 2005 ) . The fusion construct ( GG1 - SA ) was HA - tagged and inserted up - stream of an IRES - GFP cassette into a lentiviral vector contain - ing the promoter of either the ANK1 ( ankyrin 1 ) or SPTB ( spectrin ) genes to drive erythroid - speciﬁc expression ( Wilber et al . , 2010 ) . As a control , we used a construct containing just the g - globin binding zinc - ﬁnger protein ( GG1 - Only ) . To assess DNA binding speciﬁcity of GG1 - SA in vivo , constructs were introduced into the human hematopoietic cell line K562 and analyzed by anti - HA ChIP . GG1 - SA targeting was highly speciﬁc for the g - globin promoters with little or no signal at the other globin promoters ( Figure 4B ) . To determine whether GG1 - SA augments g - globin expression in primary adult human erythroid cells , we collected bone marrow - derived human CD34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells and differentiated them toward the erythroid lineage using a previously described two - phase liquid culture system involving an expansion and differentiation phase ( Sankaran et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 4C ) . Cells were infected with lentivirus containing GG1 A B C D Figure 3 . LCR Dependence of b h1 - Globin Induction by b h1 - SA ( A ) Experimental concept . Testing the activity of b h1 - SA in the absence of the LCR addresses whether it functions locally at the b h1 - globin pro - moter or requires long - range LCR looping for function .

GFP - negative cells served as controls . Sorting yielded pure populations of cells ( Fig - ure S4A ) expressing comparable amounts of GG1 - SA or GG1 - Only mRNA ( Fig - ure S4B ) . Remarkably , GG1 - SA - expressing cells produced g - globin approximating 85 % of total globin synthesis ( deﬁned as g - globin plus b - globin ) compared with (cid:1) 25 % in GFP - negative cells ( Figure 4D ) . Basal levels of g - globin expression can rise upon exposure of human erythroblasts to in vitro culture conditions ( Fibach et al . , 1993 ; Sankaran et al . , 2008 ) . This is consistent with the human fetalgenesbeingsilencedlessstringentlycomparedtothemurine embryonic globin genes ( Sankaran et al . , 2009 ) . Nevertheless , GG1 - SA induced g - globin levels that rival or exceed those achieved by pharmacological g - globin inducers ( Atweh and Fa - thallah , 2010 ; Bradner et al . , 2010 ; Cao et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2000 ) ordepletionofBcl11a ( Sankaranetal . , 2008 ; Xuetal . , 2013 ) . We observed considerable variation in basal g - globin expres - sion among donors ranging from < 10 % to 50 % of total globin synthesis ( Figure S4C ) . As erythroid cells undergo maturation , the ratio of fetal to adult hemoglobin declines . To ensure that our observed increases in fetal globin production are not confounded by variable rates of erythroid maturation due to cell culture and donor variations and / or secondary to GG1 - SA expression , we normalized g - globin transcripts against a - globin mRNA as an indicator of erythroid differentiation ( Pope et al . , 2000 ) . GG1 - SA induced a (cid:1) 2 . 5 - fold increase in g - globin expres - sion compared to GG1 - Only and control ( sorted GFP - negative cells ) populations ( Figures 4E and S4D ) . Importantly , GG1 - SA expression resulted in a marked reduction in b - globin transcrip - tion ( 13 . 5 % versus control and 18 . 1 % versus GG1 - Only ) ( Figures 4E and S4D ) . Because the sum of g - globin and b - globin tran - scripts remained similar vis - a ` - vis a - globin mRNA levels , this further supports the idea that GG1 - SA functions via competition for the LCR . Similar reciprocal changes in globin transcription upon GG1 - SA expression were observed when mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH ( Figure S4E ) . Finally , GG1 - SA expression measurably increased the expression of the surface marker CD235a ( Figure S4F ) , suggesting that GG1 - SA might enhance erythroid maturation . This prompted us to assess a panel of erythroid genes , which revealed a modest ( % 2 - fold ) Cell 158 , 849 – 860 , August 14 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 853 increase of a subset of these ( Figure S4G ) , suggesting that the increased g - to b - globin ratio is not due to GG1 - SA - mediated alterations in erythroid differentiation . Together , these results demonstrate that GG1 - SA strongly induces the expression of g - globin , with resulting loss in b - globin transcription . GG1 - SA - Mediated Induction of Fetal Hemoglobin in Peripheral Blood - Derived Erythroid Precursor Cells We next examined whether the GG1 - SA - induced increase in g - globin mRNA transcription is reﬂected in fetal hemoglobin production at the protein level . CD34 + progenitor cells isolated from peripheral blood were expanded , lentivirally infected , and differentiated toward the erythroid lineage as described previ - ously ( Breda et al . , 2012 ) . Hemoglobin proﬁles were determined by high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . GG1 - SA expression led to a dramatic increase in the percentage of HbF compared to uninfected controls or GG1 - Only ( Figures 5A and S5A ; data not shown ) . Correspondingly , adult hemoglobin levels ( HbA and HbA2 ) declined markedly . These results match those measuring g - globin and b - globin mRNA levels from these popu - lations ( data not shown ) . Similarly , we observed a dramatic rise in absolute HbF production ( as measured in micrograms of pro - tein ) with a concomitant reduction in HbA levels ( Figure 5B ) . This shift in hemoglobin production is likely an underestimate because GG1 - expressing cells were not enriched by cell sorting in these experiments . Importantly , total hemoglobin produc - tion remained unchanged between controls and GG1 - SA con - taining cells ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that in these experiments GG1 - SA expression did not signiﬁcantly affect overall erythroid maturation . Finally , we followed the effects of GG1 - SA at two stages of differentiation ( day 4 and day 8 ) of peripheral blood - derived erythroid cells by analyzing globin mRNA levels and cell surface marker expression . At day 4 of erythroid differentiation , GG1 - SA A B C D E Figure 4 . Reactivation of the g - Globin Gene in PrimaryHuman Erythroid CellsbyGG1 - SA ( A ) Experimental concept .

See also Figure S4 . strongly stimulated g - globin transcription compared to controls with high levels being sustained at day 8 ( Figure S5B ) . GG1 - SA also attenuated b - globin tran - scription at both time points ( Figure S5B ) . GG1 - SA did not impair erythroid differentiation but slightly promoted it as measured by CD235a surface expression ( Figure S5C ) , similar to the results obtained with bone marrow - derived cells . Taken together , these results demonstrate potent induction of HbF by GG1 - SA at distinct stages of erythroid differentiation and independent of stem cell source . Cellular Distribution of g - Globin Protein in Adult Erythroid Cells Containing GG1 - SA Fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) production is heterocellular in normal in - dividuals in whom a small proportion of cells with high level of HbF accounts for the overall low HbF levels ( Boyer et al . , 1975 ; Wood et al . , 1975 ) . We examined the cellular distribution of HbF in GG1 - SA and GG1 - Only - expressing bone marrow - derived cultures by staining with an anti - HbF antibody , followed by ﬂow cytometry and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . GG1 - SA resulted in nearly pancellular HbF expression , whereas GG1 - Only triggered expression merely in a subset of cells ( Fig - ure 6 ) , consistent with the mRNA analyses . This observation further highlights the effectiveness of GG1 - SA in stimulating fetal globin synthesis . GG1 - SA Induces g - Globin Promoter - LCR Looping Several lines of evidence support the model that zinc ﬁnger - SA fusion proteins work via a looping mechanism , including their reciprocal effects on embryonic / fetal and adult globin expres - sion , the dependence on the LCR for activity , and prior 3C studies , demonstrating the ability of Ldb1 and its SA domain to trigger chromatin looping ( Deng et al . , 2012 ; Song et al . , 2007 ) . To directly assess the effects of GG1 - SA expression on chro - matin contacts within the b - globin locus , we carried out 3C experiments in adult erythroblasts . GG1 - SA expression estab - lished a strong interaction between the LCR and the g - globin 854 Cell 158 , 849 – 860 , August 14 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . genes that is absent in control cells ( Figure 7 ) . Please note that the primer pair ( Gg ) used for the two g - globin promoters does not distinguish between these sequences , and the values repre - sent the average normalized signals from both ( Kiefer et al . , 2011 ) . The contact frequencies of the intervening restriction frag - ment ( primer pair G / A ) between the two g - globin genes are also increased , albeit not as much as the g - genes themselves . Addi - tionally , interactions between the LCR and the adult globin genes ( d - and b - globin ) were diminished , consistent with GG1 - SA competitively reconﬁguring looped contacts toward g - globin promoter at the expense of the b - globin promoter . In light of the variation among donor samples leading to sizeable error bars , we plotted the individual 3C experiments showing essen - tially the same results in all samples ( Figure S6A ) . Finally , results were robust toward different ways of normalizing the data ( Fig - ure S6B ; data not shown ) . In sum , tethering the SA portion of Ldb1 to the fetal globin promoters promotes their juxtaposition , with the LCR leading to transcription activation , with accompa - nying reduction in the expression of adult globin genes . DISCUSSION Here , we reprogrammed a developmentally regulated gene locus by manipulating its chromatin organization . In adult erythroid cells , redirecting the LCR to the silenced embryonic or fetal b - type globin promoters by targeted tethering of the Ldb1 SA domain strongly activated transcription at the expense of the adult b - globin genes , thus at least partially reversing the developmental gene switch ( Figure 7B ) . Our ﬁndings support that chromatin looping plays an essential role in controlling globin switching and suggest a possible strategy for the treat - ment of those hemoglobinopathies that would beneﬁt from the activation of alternative b - like globin genes . More broadly , they exemplify controlled manipulation of chromatin folding in the A B Figure 5 .

Central to the mechanism of globin gene switching is the exclusive interaction be - tween the LCR and globin gene promoters at distinct developmental stages ( Carter et al . , 2002 ; Palstra et al . , 2008 ; Tolhuis et al . , 2002 ) . In adult - type murine erythroid cells , Ldb1 is required for the juxtaposition between the LCR and the adult b - major globin gene ( Deng et al . , 2012 ; Song et al . , 2007 ) . The present re - sults indicate that the Ldb1 SA domain is also capable of forging a chromatin interaction between the LCR and globin genes that represents earlier stages of development , leading to marked in - creases in transcription . Several lines of evidence strongly support loop formation as the underlying mechanism of transcriptional activation . First , deletion of the LCR essentially abrogated the effects of the teth - ered Ldb1 SA domain , indicating that it does not substitute for the LCR by simply enhancing promoter activity but instead re - quires long - range LCR action . Second , increases in embryonic or fetal globin gene expression were accompanied by a recip - rocal decrease in adult b - globin expression , consistent with competition for long - range LCR activity . Third , 3C experiments revealed that GG1 - SA expression strongly stimulated g - globin promoter - LCR interactions with a concomitant decrease in b - globin - LCR contacts . Finally , previous 3C experiments demonstrated the sufﬁciency of tethered Ldb1 for full reconstitu - tion of an LCR - b - globin promoter loop in immature adult erythroid cells in which the globin locus is otherwise unlooped ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , in aggregate these data strongly support that Ldb1 SA - induced transcriptional activation is a functional consequence of its impact on the higher - order chro - matin organization within the b - globin locus . Prior studies involving transgenic mice suggested that genomic proximity to the LCR correlates with the ability to compete for LCR activity , presumably because closer genes have a higher probability of forging a productive interaction ( Bauchwitz and Costantini , 2000 ; Hanscombe et al . , 1991 ; Peter - son and Stamatoyannopoulos , 1993 ; Tanimoto et al . , 1999 ) . We observed that b h1 - SA not only activated b h1 - globin expression but also , to some degree , activated the expression of ε y - globin , Cell 158 , 849 – 860 , August 14 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 855 which resides closer to the LCR than to b h1 - globin . Similar to b h1 - globin , ε y - globin upregulation was dependent on the LCR . Therefore , the newly imposed spatial constraint of the LCR also increases the likelihood for interaction with a nearby gene . This lends further support to the idea that spatial proximity is a key determinant of enhancer activity . Because numerous protein complexes orchestrate the devel - opmental switch in b - globin gene expression ( Sankaran et al . , 2010 ) , it came as a surprise that a single molecule could exert such strong activating effects on the embryonic or fetal globin genes in adult erythroid cells . This indicates that direct recruit - ment of the active LCR to the g - globin genes can effectively override its developmental repression . As a corollary , it is plau - sible that regulation of chromatin looping might also underlie the function of factors normally involved in globin gene switch - ing . Indeed , Bcl11a , a potent silencing factor of the g - globin genes in human cells , does not detectably bind to the g - globin gene promoters but appears to regulate the looped conﬁguration of the locus ( Xu et al . , 2010 ) . Future studies analyzing the effects of forced LCR - g - globin looping on the various postulated g - globin repression mechanisms are expected to provide addi - tional insights into the control of normal developmental globin switching . Tethering the SA domain did not activate murine embryonic genes to the same level as the human fetal genes . This is consis - tent with a more stringent developmental repression within the murine environment ( Sankaran et al . , 2009 ) . Exposure of devel - oping human erythroid cells to in vitro culture conditions variably elevates basal fetal globin gene expression , suggesting that the human g - globin genes are in a poised and therefore more responsive state when compared to the murine embryonic genes . ( Fibach et al . , 1993 ) . Hence GG1 - SA might act in an envi - ronment that is more favorable for further activation . It is also possible that the chromatin state at the fetal globin genes facili - tates more efﬁcient access of GG1 - SA to its target site . How - ever , even under the most restrictive conditions , as are found in murine cells , the silent b h1 - gene promoter remains accessible to b h1 - SA and allows for activation of b h1 - globin expression up to (cid:1) 30 % of total b - globin synthesis . In fact , such levels , if achieved at the fetal globin genes in human sickle cell anemia patients would be sufﬁcient to ameliorate the clinical course of their disease ( see also below ) ( Noguchi et al . , 1988 ; Platt et al . , 1991 ) . If desired , means to further increase the efﬁciency of em - bryonic or fetal globin transcription induction could be conceived . Improvements in ZF design or the use of multiple ZF proteins could potentially enhance the speciﬁcity and efﬁ - ciency to raise the competitiveness of the targeted gene for enhancer activity . Alternative approaches for recruiting the SA domain , such as through TALEs or catalytically inactive CRISPR - Cas9 systems , could also be tested ( Perez - Pinera et al . , 2013 ; Sun et al . , 2012 ) . Currently , numerous strategies involving molecular genetic tools are being pursued with the goal to ameliorate sickle cell anemia . These include the transgenic expression of g - globin or antisickling forms of b - globin and genome editing to repair the sickle cell mutation or to diminish the expression of Bcl11a ( Chandrakasan and Malik , 2014 ; Bauer et al . , 2013 ; Hardison and Blobel , 2013 ) . These approaches , including the one presented here have speciﬁc strengths but also weaknesses that must be considered prior to their potential use in human patients . Several insights from our studies are relevant when considering a forced looping approach for therapeutic 0 2M 4M 6M FSC 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 0 2M 4M 6M FSC 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 0 2M 4M 6M FSC 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 50 % 24 % 80 % H b F H b F GG1 - Only GG1 - SA Control H b F Figure 6 .

First , increases in fetal g - globin expression were accompanied by reduced adult b - globin expression . This agrees with the notion that the LCR is incapable of interacting with multiple globin promoters at once but instead contacts either the fetal genes or the adult genes ( Enver et al . , 1990 ; Wij - gerde et al . , 1995 ) . The reduction in adult b - globin expression might be an added therapeutic beneﬁt because diminished syn - thesis of defective b - globin chains , as occurs in sickle cell anemia , would further improve the ratio of g - globin chains avail - able to pair with the a - globin chains . Second , in normal adults , total fetal hemoglobin synthesis ranges below 3 % but is concentrated in a small fraction of cells with high fetal hemoglo - bin expression ( F - cells ) . However , GG1 - SA expression raised fetal globin expression in the vast majority of transduced cells . Therefore , it is expected that in a therapeutic setting fewer dysfunctional erythroid cells would remain to contribute to dis - ease . Finally , marked effects in fetal globin reactivation were achieved with relatively low levels of GG1 - SA transgene expres - sion ( < 1 % of globin genes ) , which may be a more easily achiev - able and sustainable compared to what would be required if expressing a g - globin transgene . In summary , we have shown that forced long - range chromatin interactions can be used to reactivate a developmentally silenced gene . When employed at a complex gene locus at A B Figure 7 .

See also Figure S6 . which promoters compete for enhancer activity , this strategy can lead to a recip - rocal reduction in the expression of alter - nate genes . Therefore , manipulation of chromatin looping can in principle be applied for gene activation or repression at any gene that is controlled by a looped distal enhancer . Reﬁnements in targeted tethering technologies and the explora - tion of additional nuclear factors involved in chromatin looping are expected to in - crease the appeal of this technology for a wider range of applications . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Artiﬁcial Zinc - Finger Design Custom ZF proteins each containing six tandem Cys2 - His2 domains were de - signed to target 18 – 19 base pairs at the b h1 - globin promoter . ZFs were assembled from two - ﬁnger units and screened for DNA binding by ELISA assay in vitro as described previously ( Bartsevich et al . , 2003 ) . Chosen target sequences were within the DNase I hypersensitive region to facilitate access but to avoid interference with known transcription factor binding sites . Five ZFs were FLAG tagged and screened by anti - FLAG ChIP for in vivo binding to the b h1 promoter in G1E cells . Two of these produced sufﬁciently high ChIP signals with the desired speciﬁcity . The better of the two with the target sequence AAGGGGAGCAAGGTCCAG was used for experiments in this report . The lesser one also activated b h1 expression albeit to a lower degree ( data not shown ) . The ZFs targeting HS2 of the mouse LCR and the human g - globin promoters have been described previously ( Deng et al . , 2012 ; Gra ¨ s - lund et al . , 2005 ) . Constructs The b h1 - globin zinc - ﬁnger cDNA was cloned into MigR1 retroviral vector with threeFlagtagsandanuclearlocalization signal ( NLS ) atitsNterminus .

K562 cells were grown in IMDM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin . Mouse Primary Erythroblasts Fetal livererythroid cells were isolated from strain - matched E13 . 5 wild - type or D LCR / D LCR embryos ( 129 strain ) ( Bender et al . , 2000 ) , according to protocol 2012 - 7 - 660 . Single - cell suspensions were reacted with PE - conjugated anti - CD71 and APC - conjugated anti - Ter119 antibodies and sorted by FACS . S0 and S1 populations ( Figure 2A ) were infected with retrovirus and cultured for 43 – 48 hr in medium containing IMDM with 15 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % peni - cillin - streptomycin , 1 % glutamine , 10 ng / ml mIL3 , 20 ng / ml mIL6 , 50 ng / ml mSCF , 10 ng / ml mFLT3L , 0 . 5 U / ml erythropoietin ( Amgen ) , and 1 m M dexa - methasone ( Sigma ) . Two - Phase Differentiation of Bone Marrow - Derived Human CD34 + Cells Human CD34 + cells were obtained from deidentiﬁed healthy bone marrow donors after informed consent by the University of Pennsylvania Stem Cell Core . Cells were expanded in StemSpan SFEM medium with 1 3 StemSpan CC100 cytokine cocktail ( STEMCELL Technologies ) and 1 % penicillin - strep - tomycin , followed by differentiation in medium consisting of SFEM medium , 1 U / ml erythropoietin , 5 ng / ml IL3 , 20 ng / ml SCF , 1 m M estradiol , and 2 m M dexamethasone . On day 10 – 12 of differentiation , GFP + cells were sorted on a MoFlo XDP ( Beckman Coulter ) or an Ariall ( BD Biosciences ) cell sorter . Cell purity was conﬁrmed by postsort ﬂow cytometry . Two - Phase Differentiation of Peripheral Blood - Derived Human CD34 + Cells Peripheral blood was obtained from healthy donors after obtaining written consent , in accordance with protocol 05070077971 from the Weill Cornell Medical College Institutional Review Board . The mononuclear fraction from a Ficoll - Hypaque density gradient was enriched for CD34 + cells by immuno - magnetic separation using the CD34 Microbeads Kit ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . Expan - sion and differentiation were achieved using a protocol as described previously ( Breda et al . , 2012 ) .

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Anti - HA ( clone 12CA5 ) and anti - Flag ( clone M2 , F3165 , Sigma ) ChIP was per - formed as described ( Tripic et al . , 2009 ) using primers listed in Table S1 . qRT - PCR RNA from 10 5 – 10 6 cells was extracted with Trizol ( Invitrogen ) . Reverse - tran - scription reactions were performed with random hexamers using Superscript II ( Invitrogen ) or iScript ( Bio - Rad ) . cDNA samples were quantiﬁed by SybrGreen qPCR . The primers for human b - globin amplify both b - globin and d - globin cDNA with d - globin contributing less than 6 % of the total . Immunostaining Human primary cells were stained with an APC - conjugated fetal hemoglobin antibody ( Invitrogen , MHFH05 ) using the BD Cytoﬁx / Cytoperm Kit ( BD Biosci - ences ) , per the manufacturer’s protocol . Surface staining was performed with PE - labeled antiCD71 and APC - labeled antiCD235a ( BD Biosciences ) . HPLC Analyses Hemolysis of cells was achieved in ice water for 30 min and two cycles of freeze thawing . Hemoglobin content and quality were analyzed by HPLC as described previously ( Ou and Rognerud , 1993 ) , using a PolyCAT A column ( cat # 3 . 54CT0315 ; 3 m , 1500 A˚ PolyLC ) on a System Gold 126 Solvent Module instrument ( Beckman Coulter ) . Hemoglobins were measured at a wavelength of 415 nm and compared to hemoglobin standards with known concentration ( Analytical Control System ) . Chromosome Conformation Capture 3C assays were performed as described ( Hage ` ge et al . , 2007 ) with the following modiﬁcations . Cells ( 2 3 10 6 ) were crosslinked with 1 % formalde - hydeatroomtemperaturefor 10min , followedby glycine quenching , celllysis , EcoRI digestion , and T4 ligation . 3C ligation products were quantiﬁed in tripli - cates by quantitative SYBR Green real - time PCR as described previously ( Kiefer et al . , 2011 ) . The 3C signals were normalized to template standards generated from a locus - speciﬁc BAC and to 3C signals from the tubulin locus . To eliminate variability between donor samples , interaction frequencies be - tween the anchor fragment and the fragment encompassing the G g - globin gene ( Figure 7A ) or the b - globin ( Figure S6B ) from the GG1 - SA sample of each donor were set to one .
