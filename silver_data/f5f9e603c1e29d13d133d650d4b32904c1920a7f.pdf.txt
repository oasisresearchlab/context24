Here , we explore non - coding functions for mRNAs associated with focal adhesions ( FAs ) , cellular structures responsible for mediating cell adhesion and response to changes in the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . Using high - throughput single molecule imaging and genomic profiling approaches , we find that mRNAs with distinct sequence characteristics localize to FAs in different human cell types . Notably , ~ 85 % of FA - mRNAs are not translationally active at steady state or under conditions of FA dissolution or activation . Untranslated mRNA sequences are anchored to FA based on their functional states by the RNA binding protein , G3BP1 , forming biomolecular granules . Removing RNA or G3BP1 , but not blocking new polypeptide synthesis , dramatically changes FA protein composition and organization , resulting in loss of cell contractility and cellular ability to adapt to changing ECM . We have therefor uncovered a novel , non - 2 coding role for mRNAs as scaffolds to maintain FA structure and function , broadening our understating of noncanonical mRNA functions . Main Text : Mounting evidence supports the notion that intracellular localization and organization of mRNAs is a prevalent mechanism to regulate protein production and function in numerous cellular processes 1 and that the dysregulation of such control results in multisystemic diseases 2 , 3 . Initially discovered in neurons and highly polarized cells such as oocytes 4 or migrating embryonic fibroblasts 5 , RNA localization is now recognized as a wide - spread phenomenon in many cell types . One of the main mechanisms to localize RNAs is the formation of hydrogel or phase - separated droplets where RNA Binding Protein ( RBPs ) form complexes with one or multiple RNA molecules , forming ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) granules 6 . Cytosolic mRNAs can also be enriched within several cellular compartments 7 , such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the mitochondria , to form messenger RNPs and mediate local translation that facilitates key protein - protein interactions and / or signaling 8 - 10 . In somatic cells , messenger RNP granules can also function to keep mRNA translationally inactive ( processing - p - bodies ) or to sequester it after translation is temporarily arrested by stress conditions ( stress granules ) 11 , 12 . Nevertheless , in homeostasis most cytosolic and compartmentalized mRNA are recognized to be translated and their control serves to locally regulate protein levels . Even though localized mRNAs have proven to be a critical mechanism to sustain cellular homeostasis , fundamental understanding of the spectrum of biological functions underlying these mRNA foci is lacking . Filling this knowledge gap will establish a comprehensive framework of how mRNAs regulate cell functions beyond their canonical role in encoding proteins . Here we took an unbiased approach to identify the nature and function of mRNA localized at focal adhesions ( FAs ) . FAs are multifunctional organelles that connect via cell surface receptors , such as integrins , the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . FAs respond continuously to mechanical cues , such as matrix protein composition and stiffness 13 , 14 , and are essential for cellular processes that , if lost , can contribute to numerous pathologies including cancer , defects in wound healing and fibrotic diseases 15 . To meditate mechanoresponses , FAs require an arsenal of ~ 200 proteins , whose composition and organization change from smaller , circular nascent structures to mature adhesive complexes 2  m wide and 3 - 10  m long in size 16 - 18 . FAs number , morphology and cellular distribution reflect the contractile state of the cell , which is key to transduce cell - matrix interactions 19 , 20 . Several RBPs have being identified as binding partners of FA proteins 21 - 26 , and mRNAs have been found localized and translated in multiple types of cell protrusions and lamellipodia , which are notably enriched in FAs 5 , 27 - 31 . However , potential non - canonical functions of mRNAs at FAs have not been addressed . 3 Here , we employed a hydromechanical method to isolate intact FAs from the rest of the cell body ( Fig . 1A and B and fig . S1A ) 32 . Total RNAs were collected from whole cells and FAs isolates from human dermal fibroblasts ( HDFs ) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , two different adherent cell type 33 , 34 , and polyadenylated mRNA was profiled using RNA - sequencing ( fig . S1B ) . We identified 236 and 119 mRNAs that were significantly enriched in HUVEC and HDF FAs , respectively , and that 57 were shared between the two cell types ( Fig . 1C and 1D and Table S1 ) . Interestingly , we found that ~ 80 % of the shared FA mRNAs encoded for proteins important for cellular processes controlled by FAs , such as proteins involved in actin , cytoskeleton and cell adhesion protein binding . In addition , the FA mRNAs systematically exhibited higher overall and 3’UTR sequence length , number of AU - rich elements , and intermolecular RNA - RNA interactions , as compared to the whole cell mRNAs control 35 ( Fig . 1D and E , fig . S1C and D ) . Therefore , mRNAs localized at FAs are conserved among human cells and possess distinctive sequence characteristics . Using single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization ( smFISH ) , we verified that FA - localized mRNAs ( FA - mRNAs ) were found near the center of Paxillin ( PXN ) proteins , a core FA component , of both HDFs and HUVECs , in comparison to mRNAs identified in the whole cell ( Fig . 1F and G , fig . S1E and Table S2 ) . To further spatially resolve FA - mRNA localization with high accuracy , we used the multiplexed error - robust FISH ( MERFISH ) 36 approach . We designed a library of oligonucleotide probes to visualize mRNAs commonly present in HDF and HUVEC FAs and a control library of mRNAs encoding for cell cycle proteins , unrelated to our identified FAs mRNAs ( Table S2 ) . To visualize mRNAs localization to FAs , we performed MERFISH using PXN as co - staining ( Fig . 1H ) . mRNA localization over five reproducible experiments found that the distribution of FA - mRNAs was significantly closer to FAs in comparison to cell cycle mRNAs and that this enrichment was independent of the mRNAs’ overall abundance within cells ( p < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1H and fig . S1F , G , and H ) . In all , these data suggest that there is a cohort of mRNAs specifically localized to FAs . Since mRNAs at FAs encoded for proteins relevant to FA function , we tested whether translation may be the main functional reason for their localization . HDF and HUVEC FA isolates were prepared for ribosome profiling and proteomics analysis to define both mRNA translation and protein localization , respectively ( Fig . 2A ) . Notably , in HDFs , 83 % of FA - associated mRNAs were not detected as proteins in the FA , nor were detected as being actively translated , ribosome - associated transcripts . 87 % of FA - associated mRNAs in HUVECs exhibited the same lack of protein product and association with active translation ( Fig . 2B and Table S3 ) . To confirm these observations , the nascent polypeptide of putative “translated” or “untranslated” FA - mRNAs was detected via puromycylation coupled with proximity ligation ( Puro - PLA ) 37 . We first tested mRNA translation by sampling “translated” mRNA species in HDF FAs that were identified together with their proteins and ribosome protected fragments ( ~ 27 % , Table S3 ) . 4 We found that both mRNA and the forming polypeptide localized at FA , confirming their translational status ( Fig . 2C , 2D and fig . S2A ) . Next , we tested FA mRNAs categorized as “untranslated” ( ~ 83 % , Table S3 ) . While we detected mRNAs localized at FAs for all the tested mRNA species , we found 35 to 90 % less mRNA - newly polypeptide FA localization , supporting that most FA - mRNAs were not translationally active ( Fig . 2C and 2D ) . We next tested whether the translation of FA - mRNAs was dependent on FA function . We thus performed smFISH and puro - PLA in HDFs under conditions that induce de - novo FA formation or activate pre - existing FAs . First , cells were treated for 30 min with a myosin II inhibitor , Blebbistatin ( Blebb ) to disassemble FAs , before the inhibitor was washed out to rapidly reinstate FA formation 38 . Under these conditions , we found that TRAK2 , an untranslated FA - mRNA , did not form its polypeptide at new FA sites nor in other cellular compartments when compared to untreated cells ( Fig . 2E and 2G ) . Second , we stimulated pre - existing FAs in HDFs via manganese ( Mn2 + ) - induced integrin maturation 39 . Notably , we detected an increased number of TRAK2 mRNAs near larger and Mn2 + - activated FAs but failed to detect a correspondent increase in puro - PLA staining at FAs or within the whole cells ( Fig . 2F and 2G ) . Other untranslated FA - mRNAs behaved similarly to TRAK2 , whereas putative translated FA - mRNAs showed changes in protein translation depending on FA dynamics ( fig . S2B and C ) . All together , these data suggest that much of the mRNA localized at FAs is untranslated in both steady state and activated FAs . In order to continually interpret cell - matrix interactions , FAs exist in different dynamics states , characterized by diverse morphologies , cellular distribution , and number 19 , 20 . Here , we sought to understand if mRNAs distribution is related to the functional states of FAs . We used PHATE , a method that provides a representation of a high - dimensional dataset 40 , to visualize the states of FAs defined by their nearby mRNA sequences . Strikingly , we found that untranslated mRNAs were differentially localized with four main subtypes of Paxillin ( PXN ) - positive FAs in HDF ( FA - clusters ) , whereas translated FA - mRNAs were not ( Fig . 3A and fig . S3A ) . Of the fours FA - clusters , FA - cluster 3 and 0 have the most distinct characteristic from each other , where FA - cluster 3 were significantly smaller , more circular , and further away from the nuclei than FA - cluster 0 ( Fig . 3B ) . To confirm these observations , we selected mRNAs markers ( Fig . 3C ) of these two distinct FA - clusters and performed smFISH analysis . We found KIF1C and TRAK2 , which were predicted by PHATE to localize near FA - cluster 3 , were indeed detected at FAs with smaller size , higher circularity , and longer distance from the nucleus ( Fig . 3D and fig . S3B ) . In contrast , STEAP3 and ZMPSTE24 were predominantly localized to larger FAs under the nucleus corresponding to FA - cluster 0 ( Fig . 3D and fig . S3B ) . Mn2 + - integrin - dependent activation of FA - cluster 3 and 0 resulted in an increased percentage of the respective mRNA sequence markers ( Fig . 3E ) . Overall untranslated mRNAs localization is tightly associated with key functional FA states . 5 Since our data suggest that mRNA sequences are associated to FA function rather that the proteins they encode , we set out to investigate this unexpected non - coding role for mRNA at FAs . We first assayed FA states in HDFs treated with ribonuclease ( RNase A ) for 10 min to remove RNA , as compared to cells treated with Cycloheximide ( CHX ) to block mRNA - protein synthesis ( Fig . 4A and fig . S4A and B ) . We found RNase A - treated cells exhibited a drastic diminishment of FA size , an increase in circularity and a slightly decrease in FA number , as compared to untreated or CHX - treated cells ( Fig . 4B and 4C ) . Furthermore , proteomics analysis of FA isolates from control , RNase A - and CHX - treated cells supported the observation that FAs protein composition was most significatively changed in cells after RNA depletion ( Fig . 4D and Table S4 ) . Thus , mRNAs have a distinct function from translation in the regulation of FAs protein composition and consequently morphology . To further investigate this point , we analysed the effect of depleting RNAs on FA protein architecture . FAs are vertically organized into strata , composed of a basal layer of integrin cytoplasmic tails and Paxillin , a middle layer of Talin and Vinculin and an upper - most Actin - regulatory layer that is essential to connect the matrix to the cytoskeleton 41 ( Fig . 4E ) . Remarkably , the abundance of these core proteins was not de - regulated in the FAs of RNase A - treated HDFs , but the protein organization of the middle and the actin - regulatory layer of the FA strata was completely lost ( Fig . 4F and fig . S4C ) . Furthermore , RNase A - treated cells showed a significant decrease in the nuclear localization of the mechanosensitive transcription factor Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) 42 and in the overall level of phosphorylated myosin 43 ( Fig . 4G ) , both of which are consistent with the disruption of the FA protein strata and the resulting smaller and circular FAs morphology . So far , our data suggest that mRNAs might have a non - coding role in the organization of FA protein composition and architecture , which in turns impacts FA mechanoresponses such as cell contractility . If this is the case , RNase A - treated cells would not be able to adapt to substrates consisting of different structural and compositional ECM proteins 44 . Indeed , we found that while control HDFs successfully adapted their FA size depending on the ECM protein they were cultured on ( fibronectin , collagen IV , laminin , or collagen I ) , we found no difference between FA size in RNase A - treated cells seeded on any of the four ECM proteins tested ( Fig . 4H and fig . S4D ) . Together , these data suggest that the mRNAs , rather than the protein they encode , are required to regulate FA proteins architecture and composition to ensure cytoskeletal contractility and ECM adaptation . We next searched for RBPs that could explain the localization and function of our identified non - coding FA - mRNAs . We selected RBPs enriched in our proteomics analysis of HDF FA isolates vs whole cells , and depleted after treatment with RNase A , but not with CHX treatment or in control untreated cells ( Fig . 4D and Table S4 ) . Surprisingly , the top four RBPs we identified , G3BP1 , G3BP2 , DDX3X , and RBM3 , are all components of the canonical stress granule proteome 45 , with G3BP1 being the most 6 abundant ( Fig . 5A ) . G3BP1 ( GTPase - activating protein - binding protein 1 ) is a protein with intrinsically disordered regions that triggers untranslated mRNAs - dependent liquid - liquid phase separation under stress - induced translational repression 46 , 47 . G3BP1 or 2 function is mainly described in the context of a variety of cellular stressors such as chemotherapeutic drugs , UV irradiation , heat shock or oxidative stress ; thus , its role is less recognized in isolated cells in otherwise healthy conditions . Interestingly , G3BP1 has been co - immunoprecipitated or localized with several core FA proteins in other studies , suggesting that G3BP1 could be the main protein linking the organizational function of mRNAs to the FA protein complex ( fig . S5A ) . To test this hypothesis , we examined the localization of G3BP1 in HDFs and co - stained for PXN as a marker of FAs . We found that G3BP1 localized at FAs , forming branched and elongated granules of ~ 150 nm in average diameter along the outline of PXN + FAs ( Fig . 5B , 5C and fig . S5B ) . G3BP2 and DDX3X proteins showed similar FA - co - localization patterns ( fig . S5C ) . HDFs treated with RNase A for 10 minutes lost FA G3BP1 + granules relative to control untreated cells , suggesting that mRNAs are necessary for FA - co - localization ( Fig . 5C ) . We next verify how FA - mRNAs could influence the formation of G3BP1 granules . We mixed purified G3BP1 protein with two in vitro transcribed FA mRNAs that mark either FA - cluster 0 or 3 , and 10 % of the molecular crowding agent , dextran , in vitro . We observed that G3BP1 formed primarily branched / elongated granules with both FA - cluster 0 and 3 mRNAs compared to when mixed with total HDF mRNA ( Fig . 5D ) . These G3BP1 complexes were dissolved after the addition of RNase A for 5 min , confirming the key role of mRNAs in the formation of FA - mRNA G3BP1 granules in vitro ( Fig . 5D ) . Overall , these data suggest that untranslated mRNAs are necessary to form G3BP1 - biomolecular granules that co - localize at FAs . To further study the contribution of G3BP1 in localizing mRNAs at FA , we used shRNAs to efficiently remove G3BP1 expression in HDFs and used smFISH to observe mRNA distribution ( fig . S5D ) . In cells depleted for G3BP1 , we found that both FA - cluster 3 and 0 markers TRAK2 and ZMPSTE24 , respectively , decreased their association with the respective FAs , without an overall reduction of total mRNA levels within the cells ( Fig . 5E ) . Furthermore , HDFs depleted of G3BP1 , but not G3BP2 or DDX3X , showed loss of FA properties and exhibited decreased HDF contractility associated with loss of nuclear Yap and cytosol p - myosin staining ( Fig . 5F , 5G and fig . S5E ) . Taken together , our data suggest that G3BP1 is the key molecular component that mediate the non - coding function of mRNAs in the mechanoresponses of FAs ( Fig . 5H ) . Here , we showed that cytosolic mRNAs when localized to cellular organelles can form biomolecular granules with local RNA binding proteins such G3BP1 , remain translationally inactive and function to organize the network composition of protein complexes such as those forming FAs . Since untranslated mRNAs do not appear to re - enter translation under conditions of FA homeostasis , depletion 7 or activation , we speculate the FA - mRNA - G3BP1 granules have a unique structural function that is uncoupled from protein synthesis . P - bodies , so far , are the only example of cytosolic granules in normal cells that segregate translationally repressed mRNAs for decay or storage before they are reactivated for translation 48 . Interestingly , analysis of P - body proteome has shown that proteins such as G3BP1 / 2 are not part of these granules 49 . Therefore , we propose that our FA - mRNA - G3BP1 granules represent a new type of cytosolic mRNP where the untranslated mRNA have an unexpected non - coding role as “scaffold” molecules . Furthermore , these observations broaden the functional role of mRNA localization as a way for mRNA to exploit non - canonical function , opening the interesting possibility that this phenomenon might be conserved in other cytoplasmic organelles and regulate new cell functions . How mRNA can function as a structural molecule is a subject for continued exploration within the field . RNAs can promote biochemical reactions directly or through helping to seed condensates by increasing the local concentration of reaction components , such as other nucleic acid molecules as well as proteins , within a particular location . For example , nuclear droplets of nascent or long - noncoding RNAs have the biophysical property to pull together even very distal regions of the genome to regulate transcriptional protein complexes 50 - 52 . Within the cytosol , there is evidence to suggest that localized mRNAs undergoing translation , by utilizing their 3’UTR sequence , can guide protein interactions with the nascent translated polypeptide to facilitate local signalling 8 , 53 . Since our FA mRNAs do not seem to be present as singletons 54 , it is possible that multiple mRNA - mRNA interactions within G3BP1 granules might help to regulate the ideal biophysical milieu for the over 200 proteins in the FA to properly organize , function , and respond to environmental cues . Our data unexpectedly reveal that in normal somatic cells , mRNAs can mediate the interaction between FA proteins and G3BP1 , a key protein required for the early condensation of stress granules . G3BP1 assemble liquid - liquid phase separation droplets by binding mRNAs not based on recognition of specific RNA sequence motifs but based on mRNA structural characteristics that include long length and the ability to form RNA - RNA interactions 55 , 56 . Interestingly , we found that these RNA features are particularly enriched amongst the FA - associated mRNAs in comparison to cytosolic mRNAs , suggesting that G3BP1 may form FA mRNP granules using the same molecular principles used to form stress granules . We also found that different mRNA species localized at different FA states , which may correspond to diverse networks of FA proteins . Since RNA sequences , properties and expression levels can modulate the biophysical properties of granules , such as size , shape , surface tension , viscosity and composition 35 , 57 , it is possible that a more dynamic smaller FA vs a larger more stable FA could require different condensate biophysical properties to function . Since the field of biomolecular condensates is evolving rapidly , more knowledge will be required to fully understand how distinct features of mRNAs within granules can influence the structural properties of the protein complexes they are a part of . 8 The composition and localization of mRNAs at FAs , although never directly characterized , has been suggested since the 1990’s , where extracellular matrix promoted the formation of cytoskeletal microcompartments near newly forming FAs in fibroblasts and stained positively for ribosomal RNAs riboprobes 58 - 60 . Since then , localization of β - actin mRNA and its translation at FAs was identified as an important mechanism of FA stability , cell migration and neurite outgrowth 5 , 61 . Our data support these initial discoveries since some FA mRNAs were found translationally active in our FA isolates , and their proteins level was accordingly regulated upon FA perturbations . However , with the exact identification and mechanistic distribution of the mRNA species at FA , our data also suggest that FA function is dependent largely on localized mRNAs with non - coding function . Inhibition of translation at FAs did not perturb FAs , although it is possible that protein lifetime might buffer the effects of blocking local translation at FA . Overall , it could be that FAs host different types of granules based on the translational status of mRNAs associated and that these complexes could share or acquire specific functions in response to different extra - or intracellular cues to modulate different cell behaviours . Removal of RNAs or G3BP1 dissolved FA protein strata , particularly the upper - most actin - regulatory layer that is essential to transducing matrix tension into cell contractility . Cell contractility is one of the main cellular behaviours resulting from mechanotransduction of the extracellular matrix , and it is indispensable to cellular adaptation to rapid change in extracellular matrix properties . In a sense , FAs are sentinels of cellular mechanical “stress” , thus they might have developed a shared mechanism to canonical stress granules . When a cell loses the ability to sense this matrix “stress” , several pathophysiological conditions form as a result , such as wound healing defects , atherosclerosis , or cancer metastasis . The discovery that mRNAs have a non - coding function in modulating FAs open a new avenue for thinking about how aberrant matrix - cell interactions can be therapeutically corrected . The current advance in using mRNA molecules as a drug will make our data of interest for the development of future RNA therapeutics where , without affecting endogenous protein level , mRNA might regulate critical cell behaviours . 9 Figures : 10 Figure . 1 .

For manganese treatment , cells were cultured in media supplemented with manganese ( Sigma , M3634 ) for a final concentration 3 uM for 20 minutes prior to fixation . For cycloheximide ( CHX ) and RNase A treatments , cells were cultured in media supplemented with either CHX ( Sigma , C4859 - 1ML ) for a final concentration of 100 μg / mL or RNase A ( ThermoFisher , EN0531 ) for a final concentration of 1 mg / ml for 10 minutes prior to either FA isolation or fixation . Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) coatings used were fibronectin ( 2 µg / cm 2 overnight at 4 °C in PBS ) , laminin ( 1 µg / cm 2 for 2 hours at 37°C in PBS ) , collagen IV ( 10 µg / cm 2 overnight at 4 °C in PBS ) , and collagen I ( 10 µg / cm 2 overnight at 4 °C in PBS ) . Focal Adhesion Isolation 25 Focal adhesions were isolated as previously described 32 . Cells were seeded on tissue culture plastic coated with bovine plasma fibronectin ( 10 µg / mL in PBS overnight at 4°C ) . After 24 hours in culture , cells were rinsed once with PBS and then treated for 3 minutes in a 2 . 5 mM triethanolamine ( Sigma , 90279 - 100ML ) low ionic strength buffer , pH 7 . 0 . Immediately after the incubation , cell bodies were removed using hydrodynamic force ( setting 1 , Interplak , Conair ) using PBS at ~ 0 . 5 cm from and ~ 90° to the surface of the dish . Dishes were immediately inspected for removal of cell bodies using phase microscopy . Isolated FAs were washed 3 times with PBS before fixation or collection from the dish using a cell scraper ( LabScientific , CL - 25 ) in the required buffer for further analysis . mRNA - and Ribo - seq Library Preparation Total RNA was extracted from four replicates of isolated FA samples ( each replicate was pooled from four 100 mm dishes ) or matched whole cell controls from HUVECs or HDFs using TRIzol reagent ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Prior to mRNA - seq library preparation , RNA was run on a 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . ) to ensure high quality RNA . Then , 500 ng of total RNA was used to prepare Lexogen QuantSeq 3′ mRNA - Seq FWD libraries for Illumina deep - sequencing according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Libraries were amplified for 13 - 14 PCR cycles . Ribo - Seq samples were prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions using the RiboLace Kit from Immagina BioTECHNOLOGY ( RL001 ) . For these samples , cells were treated for 5 minutes with 10 µg / mL cycloheximide ( C4859 - 1ML , Sigma ) at 37°C directly prior to focal adhesion isolation . High - throughput sequencing analysis For record keeping and configuring the bioinformatics analysis , samples annotations were stored in LabxDB 62 . Annotations of human genes and the genome sequence of GRCh38 assembly was obtained from Ensembl 92 63 . The “import _ ensembl” script from the FONtools 64 was used to ( i ) download FASTA and GFF3 files from Ensembl , ( ii ) create an index of the human genome , and ( iii ) generate FON1 files containing gene and transcript annotations . QuantSeq RNA - seq analysis 26 Raw reads were first trimmed using Skewer 65 using the sequence AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC with default parameters . They were then mapped to the human genome using STAR 66 with non - default parameters " - - alignEndsType Local " and " - - seedSearchStartLmaxOverLread 0 . 8 " . FON1 files containing genes ( or “metagenes” ) were generated by concatenating the isoforms of each gene together using the “ - - method union” option of the ”fon _ transform” tool 64 . Read counts per gene were computed by summing the total number of reads overlapping at least 10 nucleotides of the gene ( i . e . metagene ) annotation . Reads mapping to multiple loci were accounted for by dividing 1 ( each read ) by the number of loci to which the read was mapped to . To identify differentially expressed genes , genes with at least 1 count in both conditions in any of the replicates were first selected , and input to the “DESeq” function 66 . The “results” function with parameters “pAdjustMethod = " fdr " , independentFiltering = FALSE” returned the differentially expressed genes . Ribo - seq analysis Raw reads were first trimmed by aligning the adaptor sequence CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC requiring matching first five base - pairs and minimum alignment score of 60 ( Matches : 5 , Mismatches : - 4 , Gap opening : - 7 , Gap extension : - 7 ) . Trimmed reads were then filtered of small RNAs by mapping them onto sequences extracted from RepeatMasker 67 ( rRNA , snRNA , scRNA and tRNA types ) and Ensembl 63 ( rRNA , snoRNA , snRNA , misc _ RNA , Mt _ rRNA and Mt _ tRNA types ) using STAR 66 with the non - default parameters " - - alignEndsType Local " , " - - seedSearchStartLmaxOverLread 0 . 8 " and " - - outReadsUnmapped Fastx " . Unmapped reads ( obtained from the last option above ) were then mapped to human genome using STAR with the non - default options " - - alignEndsType EndToEnd " and " - - seedSearchStartLmaxOverLread 0 . 8 " . The coding sequences ( in genomic coordinates from FON1 file ) were shifted of 12 nucleotides upstream to take into account the nucleotide separating the read start from the P - site of the translating ribosome . Read counts per mRNA were computed by summing the total number of reads overlapping at least 10 nucleotides the shifted mRNA annotation . Reads mapping to multiple loci ( up to 5 loci ) were accounted for by dividing 1 ( each read ) by the number of loci to which the read was mapped to . 27 Measurement of mRNA length , 3′UTR length and the number of AU - rich elements in 3′UTRs mRNA length is the longest isoform of annotated protein - coding genes . 3′UTR length is the full - length 3′UTR length obtained from Refseq ( hg19 ) . For counting of AU - rich elements , we only considered the canonical sequence AUUUA . We counted the number of AU - rich elements in annotated 3′UTRs of mRNAs expressed in HDFs or HUVEC . All values are listed in Table 1 . Calculation of normalized ensemble diversity ( NED ) values Ensemble diversity is the number of potential RNA structures that are predicted for a given RNA ( Lorenz et al . , 2011 ) . As ensemble diversity increases with RNA length ( Ding et al . , 2005 ) , we are using a length - normalized value ( NED ) . RNAs with low NED values have predominantly strong local structures , whereas RNAs predicted to have high NED values often have large unstructured regions . The ensemble diversity of 3′UTR sequences was calculated using the RNAfold software ( version : 2 . 4 . 14 ; command line : RNAfold - - MEA - d2 - p - - infile = < RNA _ sequences . fasta > - - outfile = < RNA _ sequences . RNAfold . summary > ) 68 , 69 Only 3′UTRs with a length < 7500 nucleotides can be analyzed by RNAfold . To calculate NED , ensemble diversity values were divided by the length of the 3’UTR in nucleotides . Probe Design MERFISH probe design : The template oligo pools of Focal Adhesion mRNA MERFISH ( 126 transcripts ) and cell cycle mRNA MERFISH ( 60 transcripts ) were designed similarly to that previously described 36 , for enzymatic amplification of the RNA MERFISH primary probes targeting the transcripts of focal adhesion genes and cell cycle genes , respectively . Briefly , each oligo in the template oligo pools contained six regions : 1 ) a 20 - nt 5’ forward priming region , 2 ) a 20 - nt readout region , 3 ) a 30 - nt primary hybridization region , 4 ) a second 20 - nt readout region , 5 ) a third 20 - nt readout region , and 6 ) a 20 - nt 3’ reverse priming region . The priming regions were selected according to a previous MERFISH study 36 . The 16 readout sequences were selected from a previous publication 70 . Modified Hamming - Distance 4 ( MHD4 ) coding scheme 36 was used for combinatorial barcoding . Each RNA species 28 ( gene ) was represented by a unique set of 4 out of 16 readout sequences . Each oligo in the template oligo pools harbors 3 of the 4 selected readout sequences , which shuffles among the oligos targeting the same gene . Each gene is targeted by 48 oligos . Therefore , each of the 4 selected readout regions appears 36 times on the 48 oligos for the corresponding target gene . The primary hybridization regions were chosen from the focal adhesion - enriched genes via OligoArray 2 . 1 71 with the following criteria : 1 ) The melting temperature of the oligos is not lower than 66 °C ; 2 ) the oligos do not cross - hybridize with each other at 72 °C or higher temperature ; 3 ) the oligos cannot form stable secondary structures at 76 °C or higher temperature ; 4 ) there is no consecutive repeats of six or more identical bases in the sequence ; and 5 ) the oligos do not overlap with each other . The qualified oligos were then screened against human transcriptome , Ensembl 92 by BLAST + 72 , and oligos with significant homology with transcripts from more than one gene were excluded . 48 primary hybridization regions were selected for each target gene . Single - molecule FISH probe design : The single - molecule FISH ( smFISH ) primary probes of the following genes were enzymatically amplified from a template oligo pool : TLN1 , CALD1 , MACF1 , CTNNB1 , PPP1R12A , IQGAP1 . Each oligo contained four regions : 1 ) a 20 - nt 5’ forward priming region , 2 ) a 30 - nt readout region , 3 ) a 30 - nt primary hybridization region , and 4 ) a 20 - nt 3’ reverse priming region . The priming region sequences and the readout region sequence were chosen according to a previous study 36 . The primary hybridization regions were designed as introduced above . 36 primary hybridization regions were selected for each target gene . The smFISH primary probes of SKP1 , KPNA4 , FLNB , TRAK2 , KIF1C , ZMPSTE24 and STEAP3 were individually ordered from Intergrated DNA Technology ( IDT ) , Inc . , which carried the following two regions : 1 ) a 30 - nt primary hybridization region , and 2 ) a 30 - nt readout region . The primary hybridization regions were designed as introduced above . 36 - 48 primary hybridization regions were selected for each target gene . The selected primary hybridization regions were then appended a 30 - nt readout region selected from a previous study 36 and the whole 60 - nt sequences were reverse - complemented for the order to directly yield the smFISH primary probes without the enzymatic amplification . Probe synthesis : Template oligo pools were ordered from CustomArray , GenScript . MERFISH primary probes and a subset of smFISH primary probes specified in the section above were then 29 synthesized through an enzymatic amplification procedure reported in previous studies 36 , 70 . Briefly , oligo pools were amplified through limited - cycle PCR and in vitro transcription , and converted to single - stranded DNA via reverse transcription , alkaline hydrolysis and column purification . Synthesized primary probes were dried by ThermoFisher SpeedVac DNA120 Vacuum Concentrator and stored at - 20 °C , and resuspended in 10 μL ultrapure water before usage . Dye - labeled readout probes , the remaining smFISH primary probes specified in the section above , and PCR primers for probe synthesis were ordered from Intergrated DNA Technology ( IDT ) , Inc . smFISH and quantification Cells were seeded on 25 mm coverslips in 6 - well dishes coated with bovine plasma fibronectin ( 10 µg / mL in PBS overnight at 4°C ) and allowed to adhere overnight . All samples were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature and permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 10 minutes . For the IF counterstain , the incubation steps were all conducted at room temperature . Samples were first blocked in 0 . 3 % BSA in DPBS with RNase inhibitor ( 1 : 1000 , NEB M0314L ) for 30 minutes , then stained with anti - PXN ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , ab32084 ) and secondary ( 1 : 1000 , ThermoFisher , A32731 ) antibodies in DPBS with RNase inhibitor ( 1 : 100 ) for 1 hour each , and finally post - fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes before proceeding with the smFISH hybridization . Cells were incubated in pre - hybridization buffer ( 50 % formamide , 2× saline - sodium citrate ( SSC ) ) for 5 minutes at room temperature before proceeding to overnight smFISH primary hybridization . Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 - 24 h in a humid chamber in 25μL primary hybridization buffer ( 50 % formamide , 2× SSC , 0 . 1 % w / v yeast tRNA ( Life Technologies , 15401011 ) , 10 % dextran sulfate ( Sigma , D8906 ) and 1 : 100 diluted murine RNase inhibitor ) containing 40nM primary probes per primary probe sequence . After primary hybridization , cells were washed twice in 2× SSC with 0 . 1 % v / v Tween - 20 at 60 °C for 15 min each , followed by one wash in 2× SSC with 0 . 1 % v / v Tween - 20 at room temperature for 15 min . Cells were then incubated in secondary hybridization buffer ( 20 % v / v ethylene carbonate ( Sigma - Aldrich , E26258 ) in 2× SSC , 3nM readout probe ) at room temperature for 25 - 30 minutes , and then washed 3 times with wash buffer ( 20 % v / v ethylene carbonate in 2× SSC ) for 5 min each . Samples mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade with 30 DAPI ( Thermo , P36971 ) and imaged on a Leica SP8 or Zeiss LSM980 Airyscan 2 confocal . To quantify distance to focal adhesions , the centroid of each structure was calculated using previously published Mathematica code 73 and the distance between each centroid was calculated with in house Python code . MERFISH imaging MERFISH primary probe hybridization was conducted in the same way as smFISH introduced above , except that 1 ) cells were seeded on 1 . 5 # coverslips of 40 - mm diameter ( Bioptechs , 40 - 1313 - 03193 ) , and 2 ) during primary hybridization , 25uL primary hybridization buffer containing 4 - 8uM of primary probe sets were applied . Prior to overnight imaging , 0 . 1 - μm yellow - green fiducial beads ( Invitrogen , F8803 ) diluted in 2× SSC were applied to the cells , which served as markers for drift correction purpose during sequential imaging . Imaging of the 16 - bit MHD4 MERFISH scheme was conducted by 8 rounds of automated sequential hybridization , imaging and photobleaching , using a Bioptech’s FCS2 flow chamber and a home - built fluidic system 36 . The secondary probes of MERFISH were labeled at 5’ end with either Alexa Fluor 647 or Alexa Fluor 750 dyes , and in each round of readout hybridization , two secondary probes with the two different dyes were applied simultaneously and imaged sequentially , allowing the 16 - bit MHD4 codes to be read out in 8 rounds of readout hybridization . For each round of readout hybridization , cells were first treated with hybridization buffer ( 20 % v / v ethylene carbonate ( Sigma - Aldrich , E26258 ) in 2× SSC containing 3nM each of the corresponding MERFISH readout probes with Alexa Fluor 647 and Alexa Fluor 750 labeling , respectively , and 1 : 2000 diluted murine RNase inhibitor ) . Cells were incubated with hybridization buffer for 20 min at room temperature , and then 2 mL of wash buffer ( 20 % v / v ethylene carbonate in 2× SSC ) was applied to remove excessive readout probes . 2mL oxygen - scavenging imaging buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 5 % w / v glucose , 2 mM Trolox ( Sigma - Aldrich , 238813 ) , 0 . 5 mg / mL glucose oxidase ( Sigma - Aldrich , G2133 ) , 40 μg / mL catalase ( Sigma - Aldrich , C30 ) , 1 : 2000 diluted murine RNase inhibitor in 2× SSC ) was then applied to the sample for imaging multiple fields of view . A layer of mineral oil ( Sigma , 330779 ) was applied on top of the imaging buffer to prevent continuous oxidation . 31 During sequential imaging , a series of z - stack images was taken under illumination with 750 - nm , 647 - nm , 560 - nm and 488 - nm lasers sequentially . The 750 - nm and 647 - nm lasers were used for MERFISH readout hybridization dye excitation , the 560 - nm laser for Paxillin antibody staining excitation , and the 488 - nm laser for fiducial bead excitation . The step size of the z - stack images was 500 nm , with a full depth of 3 . 5 μm on the z dimension . The exposure time at each height was 0 . 4 s . After imaging was finished for all fields of view in the current readout imaging round , 2× SSC buffer was applied to the sample to allow photobleaching of MERFISH signals , which was done by exposing cells under 750 - nm and 647 - nm lasers for 29 s . After 8 rounds of sequential readout hybridization and imaging , 3mL of 1 : 3000 diluted Hoechst ( Thermo Scientific , 33342 ) in DPBS was applied to the sample and let stand for 2 min . Imaging buffer was then applied to the sample , and z - stack images with 405 - nm laser and 488 - nm laser illumination were taken as described above . MERFISH imaging system A home - built microscope was used for MERFISH experiments , which consists of a Nikon Ti2 - U body , a Nikon CFI Plan Apo Lambda 60× Oil ( NA1 . 40 ) objective lens , and an active auto - focusing system 74 . A 750 - nm laser ( 2RU - VFL - P - 500 - 750 - B1R , MPB Communications ) was used to excite and image Alexa Fluor 750 on readout probes . A 647 - nm laser ( 2RU - VFL - P - 1000 - 647 - B1R , MPB Communications ) was used to excite and image Alexa Fluor 647 on readout probes . A 560 - nm laser ( 2RU - VFL - P - 1000 - 560 - B1R , MPB Communications ) was used to excite and image the secondary antibody for Paxillin staining . A 488 - nm laser ( 2RU - VFL - P - 500 - 488 - B1R , MPB Communications ) was used to excite and image the yellow - green fiducial beads for drift correction . A 405 - nm laser ( OBIS 405 nm LX 50 mW , Coherent ) was used to excite and image the Hoechst stain . A multi - band dichroic mirror ( ZT405 / 488 / 561 / 647 / 752rpc - UF2 , Chroma ) was used on the excitation path to direct the five laser lines to the sample . A multi - band emission filter ( ZET405 / 488 / 561 / 647 - 656 / 752 m , Chroma ) and a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 . 0 V3 camera were installed on the emission path . The pixel size of the imaging system was 108 nm . An automated motorized x - y sample stage ( SCAN IM 112×74 , Marzhauser ) was used to automatically image multiple fields of view . MERFISH analysis MERFISH decoding : MERFISH images were processed using MATLAB version R2020a using a 32 previously reported pipeline 75 . Briefly , sample drift between sequential imaging rounds was corrected by fitting the fiducial beads markers with 2D Gaussian functions , identifying the movement of their center positions in x - y plane between the current imaging round and the first imaging round , and subtracting the movement by image translation . After drift correction , the background of each image was derived by image opening using a disk - shaped structural element with an empirically determined radius of 5 pixels , and the background were subtracted from the raw RNA MERFISH image . The potential RNA signals were then identified by finding the regional maxima with pixels above a threshold , binarization , and dilation using a square structural element with a width of 3 pixels . To determine the optimal threshold for identifying RNA signals , an adaptive thresholding procedure was applied to each round of imaging , so that the relative abundance of identified RNA molecules in the imaging rounds fit the expected relative abundance derived from bulk RNA - seq data . This process was applied to all MERFISH readout imaging rounds at all z - stacks for all fields of views . Afterwards , at each z height , all 16 - bits of binarized MERFISH readout images were assembled , and a 16 - bit binary code was determined for each pixel . Pixels with a binary code that existed in the MERFISH codebook were recognized as RNA molecules . Adjacent pixels sharing the same code were processed as the same RNA molecule . For downstream analysis , the identified RNA molecules at each height were projected onto a single x - y plane along the z dimension . Cell segmentation : Cells were segmented based on dilated MERFISH signals and Hoechst nuclear staining using a watershed - based algorithm . First , the movement between the fiducial beads in the Hoechst imaging round and the fiducial beads in the first MERFISH imaging round was subtracted as mentioned above . In some datasets , uneven illumination was observed in the 405 - nm channel , and in such cases the illumination was flattened by adaptive thresholding with an empirically determined neighborhood size of 401 pixels . Hoechst nuclear staining was max - projected along the z dimension , re - scaled to a 0 - 1 grayscale image , and the image intensity was adjusted to so that the top 1 % and the bottom 1 % pixels were saturated . The Hoechst images then underwent image opening and closing by reconstruction with a disk - shaped structural element with a radius of 20 pixels to serve as foreground markers during watershed segmentation . The mean - projection of raw RNA FISH signal from both 647 - nm channel and 750 - nm channel in the first hybridization round was merged and opened - closed by reconstruction using a disk - shaped structural element with a radius of 20 pixels , which served as the background marker . 33 Focal adhesion pattern extraction : The Paxillin antibody staining in the 560 - nm channel of the first imaging round was used to extract focal adhesion patterns . The z - stack of Paxillin antibody staining underwent max projection along the z dimension . Top - hat filtering was then performed on the max - z projected images with a disk - shaped structural element with a radius of 4 or 6 pixels . The intensity of the filtered images was then re - scaled and adjusted as mentioned above , after which the images were binarized . Focal adhesion patterns were extracted from the binarized images by removing small objects from the binarized image that were smaller than 90 or 100 pixels . The mentioned parameters that had variable values were manually optimized for each individual dataset to account for minor batch differences in labeling intensity so that the binary focal adhesion patterns best resembled those in the raw images . We noticed that high antibody staining background tended to appear in peri - nuclear region occasionally , which could be mis - identified as real focal adhesions , and therefore focal adhesion patterns within 15 pixels to the nucleus edge were removed . Distance measurement among focal adhesion , RNA and nucleus : The RNA molecules were z - projected onto the x - y plane to calculate the 2D distance between RNAs and other cellular structures . The edges of binarized focal adhesions and nuclei were extracted by Sobel methods , and the positions of the points on the edges were stored and further used in measuring distance between RNA and focal adhesion edge . The positions of focal adhesion centroids and points on the nuclear edges were used to measure distance between focal adhesion and nuclear edge . Focal adhesion clustering and grouped focal adhesion property analysis ( PHATE ) : To generate RNA profile for each focal adhesion from MERFISH images , focal adhesion patterns were extracted as mentioned above , and a focal adhesion - adjacent region was defined by dilating the focal adhesion patterns with a disk - shaped structural element with a radius of 20 pixels . The RNAs that resided in the focal adhesion or the focal adhesion - adjacent region in a 2D projection were considered to “belong to” the current focal adhesion . Each focal adhesion was also assigned a unique index . A matrix was generated for each MERFISH dataset , with each row representing a focal adhesion , and each column representing the count of RNA molecules that were considered to belong to the current focal adhesion for each RNA species . Five such matrices generated from five MERFISH replicates were then imported into the Seurat package 76 in R and merged . The focal adhesions were first filtered according to the number RNA species they exhibited , and only those with more than 3 non - translated mRNA species were retained . The excluded focal 34 adhesions were assigned as “clusterNA” . Then the RNA profiles of each single focal adhesion were normalized and scaled using standard parameters , and principle component analysis ( PCA ) was performed . Louvain clustering was subsequently applied on the first six principle components with a resolution of 0 . 3 , and the markers for each cluster was determined with the following criteria : 1 ) only genes that were detected in a minimal percentage of 25 % focal adhesions of one cluster were considered ( min . pct = 0 . 25 ) ; and 2 ) only genes that showed on average at least 0 . 25 - log - fold difference between two clusters were considered ( logfc . threshold = 0 . 25 ) . To visualize the grouping of identified clusters , PHATE package 40 was applied with a number of 10 principle components to find neighbors . Feature plots of selected RNA species were plotted using a minimal cutoff of 9 th quantile ( min . cutoff = “q9” ) . To compare the size , circularity and the distance to nuclear edge , focal adhesions of different clusters were then recovered in the images based on the unique focal adhesion indices , and the measurements were taken . Specifically , the size and circularity of focal adhesions were calculated using the regionprops function in MATLAB , and the size in pixel was subsequently converted to that in μm2 . The statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism using Kruskal - Wallis test , and pairwise comparisons were conducted using Dunn’s statistical hypothesis testing with alpha = 0 . 05 . Mass spectrometry sample preparation and analysis For proteomics analysis , total protein was extracted from isolated FA samples or matched whole cell controls from HUVECs or HDFs using TRIzol reagent ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Similarly , TRIzol was used on isolated FAs from control cells , cells treated with cycloheximide , or cells treated with RNase A ( four replicates for each group ) . For all samples , the dried protein was sent to the Keck Mass Spectrometry & Proteomics Resource of the W . M . Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University . Protein abundances were normalized to total abundances of detected spectral peaks for each sample . Puro - PLA and quantification Puro - PLA protocols were conducted as described previously 77 . Here , cells were seeded on 25 mm coverslips in 6 - well dishes coated with bovine plasma fibronectin ( 10 µg / mL in PBS 35 overnight at 4°C ) and allowed to adhere overnight . Samples were treated with 1 uM Puromycin ( Thermo , A1113803 ) for 5 minutes then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS and permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 5 minutes . Proximity ligation was performed using the Duolink kit from Millipore Sigma ( DUO92101 ) according to manufactures instructions . Primary antibodies used for Puro - PLA were specific to puromycin ( 1 : 5000 , Millipore Sigma , MABE343 ) , KIF1C ( 1 : 50 , Abcam , ab125903 ) , TRAK2 ( 1 : 100 , Sigma , HPA062163 ) , CTNNB1 ( 1 : 1000 , Sigma , C2206 ) , NET1 ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , ab113202 ) , TLN1 ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , ab71333 ) , FLNA ( 1 : 500 ) 78 - 81 . All samples were counterstained with anti - PXN primary ( 1 : 40 , R & D Systems , AF4259 ) and secondary ( 1 : 1000 , ThermoFisher , A - 11015 ) antibodies to identify focal adhesions . Samples were mounted with Duolink Mounting Media with DAPI ( Millipore Sigma , DUO8204 ) and imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal . To quantify distance to focal adhesions , the centroid of each structure was calculated using previously published Mathematica code 73 and the distance between each centroid was calculated with in house Python code . Cell immunostaining and quantification For immunofluorescence analysis , FAs were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS for 10 minutes . Cells were then washed and permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in DPBS with calcium and magnesium ( Thermo , 21300025 ) for 5 minutes . Cells were blocked with 10 % serum for 1 hour , incubated for either 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies , and incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibodies . Primary antibodies used were specific to VCL ( 1 : 500 , Sigma , V9131 ) , PXN ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , ab32084 ) , ITGB1 ( 1 : 100 , Abcam , ab30394 ) , TLN1 ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , ab71333 ) , ACTN1 ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz , sc - 17829 ) , YAP ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz , sc - 101199 ) , p - MCL2 ( pmyosin , 1 : 400 , Cell Signaling , 3671 ) , G3BP1 ( 1 : 400 , Santa Cruz , sc - 365338 ) , G3BP2 ( 1 : 400 , Sigma , HPA018425 ) , and DDX3X ( 1 : 200 , Bethyl Labs , A300 - 474A ) . Secondary antibodies for either rabbit ( 1 : 1000 , ThermoFisher , A - 32731 , A - 21244 ) or mouse ( 1 : 1000 , ThermoFisher , A - 11001 or A - 21235 ) . Samples were mounted with DAPI in Fluoromount - G ( SouthernBiotech ) and imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal or Zeiss LSM980 Airyscan 2 confocal . To quantify properties of focal adhesions ( size , circularity , number , distance to nuclei ) previously published Mathematica code was used 73 . To quantify the intensity of FA proteins , the plot profile function in Image J was used . A region 36 of interest was drawn across the length of the FA and the intensity of each protein was quantified and normalized to the max value . To align the FA proteins , the length of each FA was normalized to 1 and PXN or VCL were used as reference structures . YAP staining was quantified by taking the average nuclear YAP signal ( overlapping with the DAPI stain ) and dividing by the average cytoplasmic YAP signal ( area in the non - nuclear cell mask ) . pMyosin signal was quantified by taking the average signal within the cell . For G3BP1 granules , images were thresholded in Image J and the analyze particles function was used to quantify their size . Western Blots For western blot analysis , cells or FA isolates were collected in RIPA buffer ( Thermo 89900 ) with protease inhibitors ( 1 : 200 , Millipore 539134 ) and protein concentration was determined by BCA assay ( Thermo , 23225 ) . Samples were loaded onto 4 – 12 % SDS – PAGE gels , transferred on a Immun - Blot PVDF membrane ( Bio - Rad ) , and blocked with 5 % BSA or 5 % milk for 1 hour . Blots were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C . Primary antibodies used were specific to VCL ( 1 : 5000 , Sigma , V9131 ) , PXN ( 1 : 8000 , Abcam , ab32084 ) , TLN1 ( 1 : 2500 , Abcam , ab104913 ) , GAPDH ( 1 : 8000 , Cell Signaling , 2118 ) , AKT1 / 2 / 3 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz , sc - 81434 ) , α - Tubulin ( 1 : 1000 , Millipore , 05 - 829 ) , β - actin ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz , sc - 130656 ) , PDI ( 1 : 400 , Santa Cruz , sc - 474551 ) , TOM20 ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz , sc - 17764 ) , G3BP1 ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz , sc - 365338 ) , G3BP2 ( 1 : 1000 , Sigma , HPA018425 ) , and DDX3X ( 1 : 2500 , Bethyl Labs , A300 - 474A ) . Then , membranes were washed and incubated with secondary antibody anti - rabbit - HRP or anti - mouse - HRP ( 1 : 8000 , Cell Signaling , 7076 and 7074 ) for 1 h at room temperature . After washing , blots were developed with super signal west pico chemiluminescent substrate ( Thermo ) using a SYNGENE G - Box imager . Quantification was performed using ImageJ . shRNA knockdown of G3BP1 , G3BP2 , or DDX3X Knockdown of RNA binding proteins was performed using MISSION shRNA Plasmid DNA Vectors ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Lentiviruses were prepared in Lenti - X 293T cells using shRNAs targeted to G3BP1 ( TRCN0000008723 ) , G3BP2 ( TRCN0000047550 ) , DDX3X ( TRCN0000000002 ) , or a non - specific control ( pLKO . 1 - puro non - Mammalian shRNA Control Plasmid DNA , SHC002 ) . Briefly , shRNA plasmids ( 3 µg ) were mixed with packaging ( psPAX2 , 2 . 25 µg ) and envelope ( pMD2 . G , 750 ng ) plasmids , then mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 37 ( Thermo Fisher ) for 20 minutes before being added to cells . Virus containing supernatant was collected at 36 and 60 h post - transfection , filtered , and stored at - 80°C . Cells were then infected with filtered virus in the presence of polybrene ( 8 µg / ml ) and used for experiments 3 - 5 days post infection . G3BP1 in vitro phase separation assay Phase separation assay experiments were all conducted at room temperature using human G3BP1 protein ( NBP1 - 50925 , Novus Biologicals ) . Whole cell RNA was extracted from HUVECs using TRIzol reagent ( Life Technologies ) . Cluster 0 and cluster 3 RNA was in vitro transcribed using the T7 MEGAscript kit ( AM1334 , Thermo Fisher ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Template sequences were designed and purchased using GeneArt Gene synthesis from Invitrogen and a T7 promoter was added to the 5’ end of full - length mRNA sequences for IVT . The transcription reaction was incubated overnight at 37°C and RNA was purified using phenol chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation . RNAs were dissolved in Nuclease - free water and stored at - 20°C . Prior to LLPS , a nanodrop was used to determine the concentration of RNAs and they were diluted accordingly . All experiments were conducted with 100 ng / µl RNA , 5 µM G3BP1 , and 10 % dextran as a crowding agent . RNA and protein were mixed in PCR tubes before being transferred to a chamber created by a coverslip , a glass slide , and a double - sided spacer ( Sigma GBL654002 ) . Samples were imaged using a DIC microscope using a Nikon 80i microscope with a 20x DIC objective . All imaged were captured within 20 min after LLPS induction . Statistics All the statistical analysis was performed using Prism version 9 . 2 . 0 . Unless otherwise noticed , values were analyzed with either t - tests or one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , with pair - wise comparisons using a Tukey test as appropriate .
