For engineered nanomaterials , the central dogma is that nanoparticles pass through gaps between endothelial cells ( inter - endothelial gaps ) in the tumour blood vessels , which are formed during angiogenesis 2 – 5 . These gaps were found to have a size range up to 2 , 000 nm ( refs 3 , 5 ) . Engineers and scientists use this as a ratio - nale to design particles smaller than this size , expecting them to passively enter tumours and accumulate in sufficient quantity 1 , 6 . This principle of nanoparticle delivery was established in 1986 when Jain and Maeda’s groups independently demonstrated that proteins and dyes could accumulate in the VX2 carcinoma and sarcoma 180 ascites tumour models 7 , 8 . In 1998 , Jain’s group attrib - uted this enhanced tumour accumulation of engineered materi - als to gaps between endothelial cells 3 . This was demonstrated by injecting different - sized liposomes into mouse tumour models to identify the size ranges for accumulation and by visualizing a few gaps using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . The reported existence of these large permeable gaps and the development of methods to synthesize and tune the size and shape of nanoparticles drove the field of cancer nanomedicine for three decades . However , after 30 years of limited clinical translation , the field is question - ing these mechanisms again 1 , 9 – 17 . We explored the phenomenon of nanoparticle tumour permeability and questioned the mechanism of nanoparticle entry into solid tumours . Answering this question is important because this is the first tumour barrier for nanoparticles to overcome to gain access to the microenvironment for specific therapeutic action . Determining the dominant mechanism will guide the design of delivery carriers . Results Frequency of gaps in tumours does not account for nanoparticle tumour accumulation . The current paradigm is that leaky vessels have gaps that allow nanoparticles to enter tumours ( Fig . 1a ) . We first investigated the frequency of these gaps along tumour vessels . Our first line of evidence came from TEM analysis because it has a resolution of < 2 nm and can resolve breaks within the endothelial lining of blood vessels ( Fig . 1a , b ) . We analysed the vasculature of the U87 - MG glioblastoma xenograft model because it was used previ - ously to establish gaps as a potential route for extravasation 2 , 3 . We inoculated CD1 - nude mice with U87 - MG glioblastoma cells and allowed them to grow for three weeks . We then fixed and resected tumours and used an ultramicrotome to make 90 nm slices and imaged them using TEM . We observed a total of 21 gaps across all the analysed vessels of U87 - MG tumours ( Supplementary Note 1 gives the dataset ) . We also examined different tumour models , which included slower growing syngeneic ( 4T1 , breast cancer ) , genetically engineered ( MMTV - PyMT , breast cancer ) and patient - derived xenograft ( PDX ) breast cancer because of their relevance to human tumours ( Fig . 1b ) . Gaps occurred at a very low frequency in all the tumour types ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Overall , we anal - ysed 313 blood vessels across all the tumour models and found 26 gaps ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . The total sum of vessel length anal - ysed was 9 . 2 mm ( along the major axis ) and 23 . 6 mm ( vessel perim - eter ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . This amounts to an overall average of 2 . 8 gaps mm – 1 ( with respect to the total major axis length ) and 1 . 1 gaps mm – 1 ( with respect to the total vessel perimeter ) . The over - all gap coverage was calculated to be 0 . 048 % of the blood vessel sur - face area ( Nanoparticle diffusion model section in Supplementary The entry of nanoparticles into solid tumours Shrey Sindhwani 1 , 12 , Abdullah Muhammad Syed 1 , 12 , Jessica Ngai 1 , 2 , 13 , Benjamin R .

Chan 1 , 2 , 6 , 10 , 11 * The concept of nanoparticle transport through gaps between endothelial cells ( inter - endothelial gaps ) in the tumour blood vessel is a central paradigm in cancer nanomedicine . The size of these gaps was found to be up to 2 , 000 nm . This justified the development of nanoparticles to treat solid tumours as their size is small enough to extravasate and access the tumour microenvironment . Here we show that these inter - endothelial gaps are not responsible for the transport of nanoparticles into solid tumours . Instead , we found that up to 97 % of nanoparticles enter tumours using an active process through endothelial cells . This result is derived from analysis of four different mouse models , three different types of human tumours , mathemati - cal simulation and modelling , and two different types of imaging techniques . These results challenge our current rationale for developing cancer nanomedicine and suggest that understanding these active pathways will unlock strategies to enhance tumour accumulation .

Both of these provide passive pathways for nanoparticle extravasation . Endothelial cells are connected to each other via ( 3 ) tight junctions .

This corresponds to a gap density of 500 gaps mm – 2 ( see Supplementary Discussion for details ) . Surprisingly , only 7 out of 26 gaps were inter - endothelial , whereas the remaining 19 were transcellular channels . The current paradigm of nanoparticle trans - port into solid tumours is based on extravasating through inter - endothelial gaps to allow passive accumulation 2 , 3 , 5 . However , their extravasation through transcellular channels has not been explored . One way that these channels form is by the fusion of vesicles 18 – 24 , which leads to the formation of a channel across the cell . A limitation of the TEM analysis is that it surveys a small volume of the entire tumour . We addressed this issue by using three - dimen - sional ( 3D ) microscopy as a second line of evidence ( Fig . 1c ) 25 – 27 . 3D microscopy enables us to qualitatively assess the vasculature in a continuous manner over large volumes and also avoids misinterpre - tations of gaps that might occur in 2D histology due to out - of - plane vessels . We perfused mice with fixative and cross - linkers , resected tumours and rendered them optically transparent for large volume 3D microscopy . Transparent tumours were then stained for tight junctions using antibodies against VE - cadherin ( Fig . 1c ) . The blood vessels appeared to be uniformly stained and continuously labelled , which confirms the presence of intact tight junctions across large tumour volumes . The continuity of blood vessels is in line with the TEM analysis , which found gaps to be rare . We next investigated whether the number of gaps observed via TEM is sufficient to explain the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumours . We did this by comparing the nanoparticle accumulation in tumours from two sources : mathematical modelling built using 3D images of tumour vasculature , and measuring the accumulation in tumours post - intravenous injection . This approach allowed us to determine if the accumulation in the tumour could be explained by the observed density of gaps . We developed a mathematical model of extravasation with varying numbers of gaps using the blood vessel networks mapped from 3D images of tumours ( Methods and the Nanoparticle diffusion model section in Supplementary Discussion ) . We used the effective diffusion coefficient ( D ) previ - ously determined by Jain and co - workers in the U87 - MG model ( Fig . 1d ) 28 . We input the gap density based on our TEM observations ( 500 gaps mm – 2 ) and generated random gaps within 3D mapped ves - sels at this density . The map of vessels was derived from 3D images of U87 - MG tumours . We compared the simulated nanoparticle accumulation against the measured accumulation using inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry ( ICP - MS ) 29 . We injected 50 nm PEGylated ( PEG , polyethylene glycol ) gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs ) ( see Supplementary Table 3 for nanoparticle characterization ) intravenously into tumour - bearing mice . The tumour was resected and digested to measure the AuNP accumulation using ICP - MS . We found that the simulated nanoparticle accumulation in the tumours was 0 . 0158 % ID g – 1 , which is 40 - fold less than the ICP - MS measured accumulation of 0 . 63 % ID g – 1 ( Fig . 1e ) . Our simulation shows that a gap density of ~ 30 , 000 gaps mm −2 would be required to explain the measured accumulation ( Fig . 1e ) . The tumour has 60 - fold fewer gaps than needed to explain the observed accumula - tion of nanoparticles . As our TEM analysis and simulation experi - ments show that tumour vessels are mostly continuous and do not have enough gaps to explain nanoparticle tumour accumulation , we investigated other mechanisms of nanoparticle extravasation . Nanoparticles can enter tumours through trans - endothelial pathways . We next explored trans - endothelial pathways of nanoparticle extravasation . Schnitzer and co - workers previously showed that albumin binds to the gp60 protein in caveolae of endothelial cells for transport across the vasculature 11 , 30 , 31 . Dvorak and co - workers also showed that a subset of tumour and normal blood vessels form a chain of grape - like interconnected vesicles and vacuoles , termed vesiculo - vacuolar organelles , for transport - ing ultrasmall ferritin 1 , 18 – 22 . This transport pathway has relevance for transporting small - molecule drugs and albumin across tumour vasculature , but the role of tumour endothelial cells in transport - ing nanoparticles remains unexplored 18 – 20 , 23 , 24 , 30 , 32 – 34 . Transcytosis is a metabolically active process that requires endothelial cells to rearrange their cytoskeleton and cell membrane . This includes forming vesicles that can uptake nanoparticles , forming diaphragms called fenestrae or transporting through the cyto - plasm ( Fig . 2a ) 18 – 20 , 23 , 24 , 30 , 32 – 34 . TEM analysis again formed our first line of evidence in looking at trans - endothelial transport because of the high resolution and compatibility with AuNPs ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Our analysis of tumour vasculature across all the models found that fenestrae occur at an average frequency of 60 fenestrae mm – 1 ( with respect to the total major axis length ) and 24 fenestrae mm – 1 ( with respect to the total vessel perimeter ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Vacuoles occurred at a frequency of 290 vacuoles mm – 1 ( with respect to the total major axis length ) and 111 vacuoles mm – 1 ( with respect to the total vessel perimeter ) ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . These structures occur much more frequently than the gaps . Next , we used TEM to investigate where the nanoparticles were along the blood vessel . AuNPs were injected intravenously into tumour - bearing mice and were circulated for different times ( 15 and 60 minutes ) . We then fixed tumours through cardiac perfusion with fixative . Thin sections were imaged and analysed by counting the nanopar - ticles and their associated vessel structures during extravasation . Each of the 289 vessels and 57 , 080 nanoparticles ( Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Note 1 ) were analysed independently by 3 researchers to avoid bias and ensure internal validity . Annotated images were counted using MATLAB ( MathWorks ) to avoid any counting errors and bias . We found that nanoparticles inter - act with and are taken up by endothelial cells that lined tumour vessels ( Fig . 2b , c and Supplementary Table 3 ) . AuNPs of all three core sizes ( 15 , 50 and 100 nm ) were found inside the vesicles and cyto - plasm and along the membrane of the endothelial cells of tumour vessels ( Fig . 2b , c and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ) . This is direct evidence that nanoparticles can use trans - endothelial pathways to extravasate into the tumour . This process is continuous as AuNPs were found to be extravasating at four hours ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . We quantified this transport by measuring the proportion of 50 nm AuNPs that extravasated between 15 and 60 minutes of circula - tion ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . The proportion of nanoparticles in the extravascular space of U87 - MG and MMTV - PyMT tumours increased from 26 – 33 % to 42 – 44 % of the total quantified nanopar - ticles . Similar to mapping tight junctions , we used 3D microscopy as a second line of evidence to map the location of structures involved in the trans - endothelial pathway . PV - 1 is a structural protein found in fenestrae and vesicles 35 – 37 . We stained our transparent tumours with antibodies against PV - 1 and found continuous labelling of endothelial cells ( Fig . 2d ) . This uniform labelling is also in line with our TEM analysis of fenestrae and vesicles which occurred at a very high frequency along the blood vessels . Our analysis yields two conclusions . First , gaps occur infrequently along tumour vessels . Second , nanoparticles can use active transport through trans - endothelial pathways to enter solid tumours . This made us question which mechanism among these two mechanisms—passive transport through gaps or active transport through trans - endothe - lial pathways—accounts for the majority of nanoparticle accumula - tion in tumours . Trans - endothelial pathways are the dominant mechanism of nanoparticle extravasation into tumours . We do not know which of the above mechanisms dominates because it remains elusive to isolate and measure their individual contributions to nanoparticle accumulation in tumours . We solved this challenge by developing a model , termed Zombie , in which tumour - bearing mice were per - fused with a fixative to deactivate any cellular activity while preserv - ing the vessel architecture ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Video 1 ) . NATURE MATERiALS | VOL 19 | MAY 2020 | 566 – 575 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 568 Articles Nature Materials This model allowed us to separate the contribution of passive gap and active trans - endothelial transport and determine the domi - nant mechanism because the active mechanisms are deactivated . We hypothesized that the fixation step in the Zombie model would block the morphological changes that underlie trans - endothelial transport but would keep gaps along the tumour vessels open for nanoparticle extravasation . We validated this by showing that : ( 1 ) no new gaps were created in tissues such as muscle and skin ( Fig . 3c , d ) , ( 2 ) kidney gaps maintained their size ( ~ 6 . 5 nm ) as they did not allow 50 nm AuNPs to pass through ( Fig . 3e ) and ( 3 ) gaps in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells remained open for nanoparti - cle accumulation ( Fig . 3f ) . We provide a detailed validation of the Zombie model in the Supplementary Discussion . As AuNPs can be quantified using ICP - MS and imaged with 3D microscopy 25 – 27 , 38 , we compared nanoparticle accumulation in Zombie and tumour - bear - ing live mice ( that is , control tumours ) to delineate the individual contributions of passive gaps and active trans - endothelial mecha - nisms ( Fig . 3a ) . a b ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Fenestrae ( 2 ) Vacuoles i ii i ii i ii i ii i ii i ii d 15 n m 50 n m 100 n m Red : fenestrae ( PV - 1 ) i ii i ii c Fig . 2 | Nanoparticles can extravasate through active trans - endothelial pathways . a , Trans - endothelial pathways for nanoparticles include ( 1 ) formation of fenestrae and ( 2 ) uptake in vesicles and cytoplasmic shuttling .

NATURE MATERiALS | VOL 19 | MAY 2020 | 566 – 575 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 569 Articles Nature Materials We used the Zombie model to determine the dominant mecha - nism of nanoparticle accumulation .

The accumulation in this model is due to only passive pathways , such as gaps , compared to control mice , which account for both gaps and trans - endothelial pathways . This allows for the isolation of the contribution of each of those pathways . b , Photographs of mice before and after perfusion of the nanoparticles through cardiac access .

The kidney ( e ) and liver ( f ) are examples of tissues that have gaps to allow for filtration . The 50 nm AuNPs cannot cross the kidney glomerular filtration unit because their size is above the ~ 6 nm cutoff . The sinusoidal endothelial cell lining of liver vessels has bigger gaps and allows for nanoparticle extravasation into the space of Disse .

After circulating the nanoparticles for the same amount of time and the same concentration inside the animal , tumours were resected and digested to measure the amount of gold using ICP - MS . This measurement gave us the relative amount of injected dose ( ID ) of nanoparticles that accumulated in the tumour ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . We found that tumours in Zombie mice only accumulated 0 . 10 % ID g – 1 of the 50 nm AuNP dose , whereas control mice accumulated 2 . 01 % ID g – 1 after four hours ( Fig . 4a ) . As Zombie mice do not have a functional clearance system to cause the exponential decay of nanoparticle concentration in blood , we corrected for it in the Zombie tumours by adjusting the accumula - tion based on the observed area under the curve of nanoparticles in blood in the control ( see Methods for a detailed explanation ) . We found that the relative contribution of gaps for 50 nm AuNP is only 3 % compared to that of the control .

NATURE MATERiALS | VOL 19 | MAY 2020 | 566 – 575 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 571 Articles Nature Materials mimics human breast cancer . We found a similar relative contri - bution of gaps ( Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We also repeated the experiment with the inclusion of red blood cells in addition to nanoparticles and serum in the circulation and found similar relative contribution of gaps ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . We found that the contribution of gaps to drug accumulation is size dependent : it ranged from 35 % for cisplatin ( M r , 300 Da ) to 3 % for 50 nm AuNPs ( Fig . 4b ) . Surprisingly , we found the relative contribu - tion increased to 25 % for 100 nm AuNPs ( Fig . 4b ) . The contribution of different trans - endothelial transport pathways may vary with size and requires further investigation . Overall , gaps only account for 3 – 25 % of the nanoparticle extravasation . We further imaged tumours in Zombie and control mice using TEM and 3D micros - copy to investigate whether nanoparticles were able to extravasate out of vessels and into the tumour microenvironment ( Fig . 4c – f ) . We found that nanoparticles were able to extravasate in control animals but not in Zombie animals . We quantified this from TEM images to find that 49 % of the AuNPs had extravasated in control animals compared to 0 % in Zombie mice ( Fig . 4g ) . 3D microscopy also showed that AuNPs remained localized within the blood ves - sels of Zombie mice , but were able to extravasate deeper into the tumour in control mice ( Fig . 4e , f ) . We attribute these spatial find - ings to trans - endothelial pathways being active in control animals . Our quantitative and imaging data show that the dominant mecha - nism for nanoparticle entry is trans - endothelial . Our fourth line of evidence came from evaluating the endothelial features that are closest to the extravasated nanoparticles . We tested for correlations between the location of extravasated nanoparticles with active trans - endothelial or passive gap - based transport path - ways . For each image of a blood vessel , we divided the vessel into ten bins along the circumference of the blood vessel ( Fig . 5a , b ) . We measured the number of extravasated nanoparticles and blood ves - sel features ( tight junctions , fenestrae , vesicle and inter - endothelial gaps and transcellular channels ) within each bin ( Supplementary Note 2 gives the key ) . We counted nanoparticles that touched the luminal wall of the endothelial cell , and that were inside endothe - lial vesicles and cytoplasm . For all the images , we performed cor - relative analysis between the extravasated nanoparticles , blood vessel features and nanoparticles associated with endothelial cells ( Fig . 5a ) . The correlation between extravasated AuNPs and endothe - lial features is strongest with tight junctions ( P value of 4 . 28 × 10 − 13 ) , even though these junctions form a seal that prevents nanoparticle transport ( Fig . 5b ) . The region close to the tight junction is the thin - nest part of the lumen , which may allow transport through invagi - nations that form vesicles and fenestrae 21 , 22 , 24 . Extravasated AuNPs also significantly correlated with vesicles ( P value of 6 . 44 × 10 − 7 ) ( Fig . 5b ) and with nanoparticles found in one of the intermedi - ary states of trans - endothelial transport ( P values : nanoparticle on the luminal wall , 1 . 00 × 10 − 6 ; nanoparticle in an endothelial cell vesicle , 2 . 86 × 10 − 6 , nanoparticle in the endothelial cell cytoplasm , 8 . 07 × 10 − 10 ) ( Fig . 5b ) . This suggests that extravasated nanoparticles most likely followed one of these routes as they entered the tumour microenvironment . Our spatial analysis also shows that nanoparti - cle extravasation did not correlate significantly with any type of gaps , which is the basis for the current dogma of nanoparticle extravasa - tion into tumours ( P values : intercellular gaps , 0 . 54 ; transcellular channels , 0 . 097 ; all gaps , 0 . 14 ) . Surprisingly , when gaps were found , nanoparticles were not found near most of them ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Our spatial analysis also supports the trans - endothelial route as the dominant pathway of nanoparticle extravasation into the tumour ( Supplementary Fig . 5 gives the methodology ) . Last , we performed intravital microscopy to look at nanoparticle extravasation in two mouse tumour models ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Intravital microscopy captures the dynamic aspect of nanoparticle extrava - sation , which is different from static techniques used above . This enabled us to image the nanoparticle extravasation in real time and monitor their signal colocalization with other elements of the microenvironment . We saw focal spots of colocalization between the nanoparticle signal and endothelial cells ( Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Video 2 ) . These areas of nanoparticle colocalized with blood vessels indicate interactions between the nanoparticles and endothelial cells . These spots are not transient . We attribute these spots to different stages of extravasation via transcytosis that occurs in the endothelial cell vicinity , such as uptake , vesicular localization and exit into the tumour interstitium , as seen with TEM ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The combination of these five lines of evidence reinforces the conclusion that nanoparticles enter the tumour from blood vessels predominantly due to active trans - endothelial mechanisms . We attempted to find if one of the known pathways could be involved in transcytosis of the nanoparticles across the tumour endothe - lium . Based on work by other labs 39 – 43 , we investigated the role of caveolin and vessel normalization on nanoparticle transport and tumour accumulation . We found that the tumour accumulation of 50 nm AuNPs did not change by either knocking out caveo - lin - 1 ( Supplementary Figs . 6 – 8 and Role of caveolin - 1 section in Supplementary Discussion ) or by vessel normalization through VEGFR - 2 blockade using DC101 ( Supplementary Fig . 9 and Role of vessel normalization section in Supplementary Discussion ) . Future work that investigates these pathways for different nanoparticle types and chemistries , as well as tumours , will allow us to evaluate their broader role in extravasation . Gaps are also rare in tumour vessels from cancer patients . We wanted to ensure that the discovery of nanoparticle trans - endothe - lial transport was generalizable and relevant for tumours in humans . We found evidence for trans - endothelial transport of nanoparticles in xenograft ( U87 - MG ) , syngeneic ( 4T1 , breast cancer ) , geneti - cally engineered ( MMTV - PyMT , breast cancer ) and PDX breast cancer mouse models ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . We also examined human patient tumour samples to compare blood vessel structures with mouse models results ( Fig . 6 and Supplementary Table 8 ) . We obtained fixed human tumour samples that belong to three differ - ent tumours types from the Ontario Tumour Bank . These tissues were then fixed and sliced for TEM and 3D microscopy to investi - gate the vessel ultrastructure and analyse the large - volume tumour , respectively . We found that the blood vessels in human tumours were similar to those in mouse models . Specifically , we found that the frequency of features was similar to that in mouse models as shown in Supplementary Table 1 and that human tumours also had sealed blood vessels with tight junctions and fenestrae along the endothelial lining ( Fig . 6 and Supplementary Table 8 ) . The features were structurally identical when compared at an ultrastructure level across different human tumour models and with mouse models . Similar to 3D microscopy for mouse models , we immunolabelled tight junctions ( VE - cadherin ) and a component of diaphragms of fenestrae and vesicles ( PV - 1 ) in human samples . The vessels stained uniformly with these markers in large volumes , which indicates that the vessels are sealed and that they express proteins associated with transcytosis ( Fig . 6d – f and Supplementary Video 3 ) . Magnified images show clear patterns of junctional staining that mark the endothelial walls with no discontinuity ( Fig . 6d – f ) . This is similar to our findings in mice models . The combined evidence from TEM and 3D microscopy shows that opportunities for cancer nanomed - icine to enter tumours passively are also rare in human tumours because there are not enough gaps . Discussion We investigated whether nanoparticles are being transported into the tumour microenvironment by a passive or active process . Many perspectives have been written on this topic but there is a lack of original data that enables researchers to address this question 1 , 13 . NATURE MATERiALS | VOL 19 | MAY 2020 | 566 – 575 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 572 Articles Nature Materials The lack of data is likely due to multiple reasons . First , there is the lack of a single technique capable of visualizing individual nanopar - ticles entering into solid tumours . Second , there is a lack of studies that directly examine this mechanism . All the techniques used have advantages and disadvantages in addressing this question and , thus , answering it requires a multitude of complementary techniques . For example , TEM has nanoscale resolution but is static and has a limited volume of analysis . Intravital microscopy can provide real - time analysis of nanoparticle transport into tumours , but the resolution is limited 44 . Thus , we gathered multiple lines of evidence from different techniques and models to answer how nanoparticles enter solid tumours . We examined the current paradigm that nanoparticles are trans - ported through gaps measuring up to 2 , 000 nm between endothelial cells in a tumour 3 , 5 , 7 , 44 . This mechanism suggested that researchers should design particles smaller than this size to enter the tumour . We found that gaps occurred rarely and that transport through them was not the dominant mechanism of entry into mouse tumour models using a combination of TEM , 3D imaging , the Zombie experiment and computational analysis . We analysed over 300 randomly selected vessels because our computational analysis revealed that this large number of vessels is required to reduce the probability of measuring anomalies in the tumour gap frequency due to random angle sectioning of the tissue sample ( Sampling sec - tion in Supplementary Discussion ) . The sample preparation itself was randomized and blinded as well . These observations were fur - ther tested by the Zombie model , which decoupled the contribution of passive and active mechanisms .

NATURE MATERiALS | VOL 19 | MAY 2020 | 566 – 575 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 573 Articles Nature Materials by simulating nanoparticle extravasation through gaps in our 3D images and found that the observed gap frequency from TEM could not account for the measured nanoparticle tumour accumulation . We consistently found that passive extravasation contributed only a fraction of the nanoparticle tumour accumulation . This motivated us to look for an alternative transport mecha - nism . We again used a combination of tools , such as TEM , intra - vital imaging and 3D imaging across multiple tumour models to look for nanoparticles extravasating actively through endothelial cells . An active process could occur in many forms . This could be due to the binding of nanoparticles to endothelial cells and trans - port through them inside vesicles , transport through transcellular channels that are formed through connecting vesicles and / or fenes - trae or any other mechanisms that have not yet been discovered . All these processes are dynamic , require energy to drive the trans - port and can vary between tumours . The next set of studies ( dis - cussed below ) should delve deeper into these mechanisms to establish a further understanding of how nanoparticles are actively transported through tumour endothelial cells . Outlook Our key finding is that the dominant mechanism of nanoparticle transport is an active process and not a passive process . This will probably lead to debates , discussion , and studies that should aim at refining and manipulating the specific active mechanisms of trans - port . We have placed the original data in the open source FigShare for access . We outline 5 areas of investigation moving forward .

Second , we need to understand the role of surface adsorbed proteins on nanoparticle interaction with tumour endothelial cells . Third , we can devise strategies to manipulate tumour endothelium to enhance the trans - endothelial transport of nanoparticles ( an example of this has been demon - strated by the Schnitzer lab for antibody transport 32 ) . Fourth , the role of different tumour vessel types and different trans - endothelial pathways with respect to extravasation of varying nanoparticle size , shape and surface chemistry needs to be elucidated . Lastly , we also need to understand the role of immune cells and other cells gen - erating transient permeability 45 , 46 . These studies will fill remaining gaps in our understanding of nanoparticle entry into tumours and enable strategies to overcome the poor clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines .

All the materials were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich unless otherwise mentioned . Preparation of AuNPs . AuNPs were prepared using previously established reduction methods in our lab 47 , 48 . We used 15 nm AuNPs as seeds to make larger AuNPs ( 50 and 100 nm ) . The 15 nm AuNPs were synthesized by first boiling and stirring 100 ml of 0 . 25 mM chloroauric acid ( Sigma ) . Then 1 ml of 3 . 3 % w / v aqueous sodium citrate dibasic trihydrate was added to this solution , which subsequently reduced chloroauric acid . The solution changed colour from dark purple colour to bright red over 10 min . This solution was cooled to room temperature . The 15 nm AuNPs were then characterized for their size and concentration using dynamic light scattering and ultraviolet – visible absorbance spectroscopy , respectively 47 , 48 . To prepare the 50 nm AuNPs , 967 μ l of 25 mM chloroauric acid ( Sigma ) , 93 . 75 ml of deionized water , 967 μ l of 15 mM sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate and 3 . 35 ml of 2 . 4 nM 15 nm AuNP seeds were mixed and stirred overnight . Similarly , to prepare the 100 nm AuNPs , 997 μ l of 25 mM chloroauric acid ( Sigma ) , 96 . 7 ml of deionized water , 997 μ l of 15 mM sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate and 0 . 305 ml of 2 . 4 nM 15 nm AuNP seeds were mixed and stirred overnight . Both of these reactions to increase size can be scaled up tenfold by increasing the concentrations of the components by tenfold without increasing the deionized water volume . The next day , Tween 20 was added to these reactions at a final concentration of 0 . 05 % v / v . This stabilizes the AuNPs during centrifugation . The 50 nm and 100 nm AuNPs were concentrated by centrifuging for 2 h in 50 ml Falcon tubes at 2 , 000 and 1 , 000 g , respectively . Concentrated stocks were kept at 4 °C until PEGylation . Preparation of PEGylated AuNPs . The PEGylation of AuNPs refers to nanoparticle surface conjugation with PEG . For all three AuNP sizes ( 15 , 50 and 100 nm ) , this was done using thiol chemistry , as described previously 25 , 26 , 29 , 38 , 49 . Methoxy - PEG - thiol ( mPEG , 5 , 000 Da ; Laysan Bio ) was dissolved in deionized water at 10 mg ml – 1 . This solution was added to AuNPs ( dispersed in 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) such that the ratio of PEG to the AuNP surface was 5 PEG molecules nm – 2 of the nanoparticle surface area . This reaction was done at 60 °C for 1 h . Unconjugated excess PEG was removed by centrifuging the AuNPs , at the same speed as mentioned above , three times with PBS . These PEGylated AuNPs were stable and stored at 4 °C . Injection of PEGylated AuNPs into mice . The PEGylated AuNPs were injected intravenously , using a 29 gauge insulin syringe , into mice at doses of 2 × 10 12 AuNPs ( 100 nm ) , 2 × 10 13 AuNPs ( 50 nm ) , 1 × 10 14 AuNPs ( 15 nm ) . All of these injections were done by dispersing the required AuNPs in 150 µ l of PBS . Mice tumour models . Four different mouse tumour models were used in this work : U87 - MG , 4T1 , PDX and MMTV - PyMT . U87 - MG . This xenograft tumour was developed by injecting 5 – 7 million cells in 200 µ l of a 50 : 50 PBS : Matrigel solution into the subcutaneous area in the right flank of the CD1 Nude mouse ( Charles River Canada ) . The tumour was allowed to grow to 1 cm 3 over 4 – 6 weeks . 4T1 . This syngeneic tumour was developed by injecting two million cells in 200 µ l of a 50 : 50 PBS : Matrigel solution into the mammary fat pad of BALB / c mouse ( Charles River Canada ) . The tumour was allowed to grow to 400 – 600 mm 3 over 4 – 6 weeks . PDX . The PDX Triple Negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC ) tumours ( HCI - 002 ) were sectioned into ~ 2 × 4 mm chunks and surgically implanted within NOD - SCID ( Charles River Canada ) mice within the mammary fat pad . The rationale for using the PDX model here was threefold . First , it allowed us to preserve the tumour microenvironment from the patient and include cells such as fibroblasts , macrophages and immune cells while implanting the tumour . Second , it allowed us to develop a cancer model from a cell line that has not undergone years of passage , as is the case in xenograft models . This means that the cancer cells implanted have fewer mutations and are more representative of the patient . Lastly , the PDX model of breast cancer allowed us to examine breast cancer across three different tumour implantation models—orthotopic syngeneic ( 4T1 ) , PDX and MMTV - PyMT ( genetically engineered mouse model ) . MMTV - PyMT . This genetically engineered mouse model was graciously donated by M . E . ( Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ) . This has been previously used by their lab for visualizing the tumour microenvironment 50 . Purpose of 3D imaging and TEM . Images from TEM were analysed manually to count the gap frequency . This was done because gaps cannot be visualized by 3D optical microscopy due to the diffraction limit of light . 3D optical microscopy provided a qualitative evaluation of large - volume staining for markers related to the blood vessel structure . Transcardial perfusion fixation for 3D imaging . Perfusion procedures were the same as published previously 25 – 27 . We also conjugated Unconjugated Griffonia Simplicifolia Lectin I ( Vector Labs , Catalogue no . L - 1100 ) to Sulfo - Cy3 - NHS ( Click Chemistry Tools , Catalogue no . 1075 - 25 ) using previously established methods 25 – 27 . GSL1 - Cy3 ( 0 . 15 ml of 1 mg ml – 1 ) was injected intravenously via the tail vein to label the mouse vasculature . This was allowed to circulate for 5 min . Mice were then anaesthetized under a continuous flow of 3 % isoflurane in oxygen . Surgical procedures to access heart the were performed by opening the ribs and dissecting along the sides . The needle was inserted in the left ventricle and 60 ml of PBS solution that contained 10 U ml – 1 Heparin ( Bioshop Canada Inc . ) and 0 . 5 % w / v sodium nitrite ( Sigma Aldrich ) in 1 × PBS was injected at a constant flow rate of 5 – 7 ml min – 1 . Next , 60 ml of monomer solution was infused at the same flow rate . This monomer solution was made of 4 % formaldehyde ( Bioshop Canada Inc . ) , 2 % acrylamide ( Bioshop Canada Inc . ) and 0 . 25 % initiator ( VA - 044 azoinitiator , Wako Chemicals ) in 1 × PBS solution . After perfusion , the desired organs were resected and incubated in the same monomer solution at 4 °C for another 7 days . Tissue cross - linking for 3D imaging . After 1 week of incubation with the monomer solution , the tissues were cross - linked by following procedures as per previously published work 25 – 27 . The monomer solution was replaced with fresh 20 ml of the same solution . Fresh frozen human samples were also processed in a similar way and transferred to 20 ml of monomer solution . The samples were degassed and purged with argon three times . During these cycles , the caps on the falcon tubes were perforated . This removed most of the oxygen and the tubes were sealed by tightening the caps and wrapping with parafilm over the top . The samples were polymerized at 37 °C with shaking for 3 h . The solution was viscous due to cross - linking at the end of this cycle . Excess solution was removed and gelled tissues were rinse with deionized water and then stored in 10 ml of borate buffer ( 200 mM sodium borate , pH 8 . 5 , 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 and 0 . 01 % sodium azide ) at 4 °C . Tissue clearing . Tissues were cleared passively as established previously 25 – 27 . After the gelling in the previous step , tissues were placed in the clearing solution ( 4 % w / v sodium dodecyl sulfate and 200 mM sodium borate at pH 8 . 5 ) for 2 weeks at 50 °C using 15 ml of clearing solution for 1 – 2 mm slices . Once cleared , these were stored at 4 °C in borate buffer . 3D tissue immunostaining . Staining involved blocking and the use of primary and secondary antibodies . Details regarding these antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 9 . Non - specific staining was reduced by first blocking the cleared tissues with 5 % w / v bovine serum albumin in 1 × PBS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and 0 . 01 % sodium azide solution overnight at room temperature with gentle agitation . The tissues were then incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for 3 days in a solution that contained 1 ml of 2 % v / v goat serum , PBS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and 0 . 01 % sodium azide at a specific dilution ( Supplementary Table 9 gives the dilutions ) . The tissue was then washed three times with 10 ml of PBS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and 0 . 01 % sodium azide solution over a period of 24 h at room temperature . The tissue was then stained with secondary antibody at room temperature for 3 days in a solution that contained 1 ml of 2 % v / v goat serum , PBS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and 0 . 01 % sodium azide at a specific dilution ( Supplementary Table 9 gives the dilutions ) . The tissue was then washed three times with 10 ml of PBS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and 0 . 01 % sodium azide solution over a period of 24 h at room temperature . The tissue was transferred into 67 % 2 , 2 ′ - thiodiethanol solution in 200 mM borate , 0 . 1 % Triton - X and 0 . 01 % sodium azide solution for refractive index matching . This was done a day before imaging to make a homogeneous refractive index inside the tissues . Transcardial perfusion fixation for TEM . This procedure is same as that described above in the Transcardial perfusion fixation for 3D imaging except that only one solution , the TEM solution ( 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 1 × PBS ) , was infused instead of PBS or monomer solution . This was followed by storing the sample in the TEM solution at 4 °C until sample preparation for TEM . Zombie fixation and nanoparticle circulation . Zombie was developed by first fixing the whole mouse using transcardiac perfusion with the TEM solution ( 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 1 × PBS ) for 20 min . Supplementary Video 1 shows our set - up with a box , pump and circulation . The fixed animal was then placed inside the box for 1 h of further fixation at 37 °C . The box was closed and sealed to avoid any evaporation . After 1 h , the fixative was removed , the box was washed and nanoparticle solution was added for circulation . The concentration of this nanoparticle solution was same as that in the control animal assuming 1 . 8 ml of blood . To do this , we added a fivefold amount of nanoparticles in 9 ml of either PBS or 100 % serum solution ( CD1 nude mouse serum , Innovative Research ) . An additional condition was also tested in which nanoparticles were fivefold the amount of nanoparticles in 9 ml , a solution that contained 55 % serum ( CD1 nude mouse serum , Innovative Research ) and 45 % red blood cells ( CD1 nude mouse red blood cells , Innovative Research by volume . This was done to mimic blood . Each of these nanoparticle solutions was then circulated in the fixed mouse at a physiologically relevant flow ( 5 – 7 ml min – 1 ) rate using a peristaltic pump that alters the pressure during circulation . The circulation lasted for 4 h for NATURE MATERiALS | www . nature . com / naturematerials Articles Nature Materials PEGylated 15 s , and 50 s and 1 h for PEGylated 100 nm AuNPs . The tumours were then resected from these mice and processed for TEM and ICP - MS . Zombie fixation for 3D imaging . We modified the procedure for 3D imaging of Zombie mice because the initiator that cross - links the tissue to form the hydrogel before clearing is activated by temperature . The goal of doing 3D imaging with the Zombie mice was to visualize the distribution of nanoparticles when the active pathways were not present . We started the procedure by injecting the animal with Cy3 - labelled GSL - 1 intravenously . After 5 – 10 min , we proceeded with the transcardiac perfusion procedure for 3D imaging . We perfused the animal with 60 ml of a PBS solution that contained heparin and sodium nitrite ( see above ) . Then , we perfused it with 60 ml of the hydrogel monomer solution without the VA - 044 initiator ( 4 % formaldehyde and 2 % acrylamide in 1 × PBS ) . This was done to fix the proteins in place without polymerizing the acrylamide hydrogel . We then circulated AuNPs ( incubated in serum to mimic physiological conditions ) through the fixed mice . After this round , we then circulated the monomer solution with the initiator similarly to that for the 3D imaging processing and kept the tissues for a week incubating with the same solution . The rest of the procedure for the 3D imaging of Zombie mouse was same as described in the section above . Quantification of nanoparticle accumulation and pharmacokinetics using ICP - MS . The gold content inside any organ can be measured using ICP - MS . This was carried out using established procedures published previously 25 , 26 , 38 . Tumours were resected , weighed and placed in 50 ml Falcon tubes . They were then digested with 2 ml of nitric acid ( ACS grade , Caledon ) and 0 . 5 ml of hydrochloric acid ( ACS grade , Caledon ) at 70 – 80 °C overnight . The tissues appeared digested and dissolved . The samples were diluted to 50 ml with deionized water and then filtered with 0 . 22 µ m PES filters ( Millipore ) using a 10 ml syringe . The filtered digest was then processed using ICP - MS and analysed using a standard curve derived from stock with a known quantity of gold . The concentration inside the Zombie model remained the same because the circulation maintains a fixed amount in a given volume circulating through the animal with no active ongoing processes . This does not capture the exponential decay in concentration of nanoparticles that occurred in the control tumour - bearing mice . Thus , the nanoparticle accumulation measured in the tumours of Zombie mice using ICP - MS requires a correction factor that accounts for the decreasing blood correction of a control animal . To do this , we performed pharmacokinetics of AuNPs by collecting and digesting blood samples from mice at eight time points within the first 24 h . Blood ( 0 . 01 – 0 . 05 m ) was collected from the tail of mice and stored in Eppendorf tubes . The blood was digested with 0 . 5 ml of nitric acid ( ACS grade , Caledon ) and 0 . 1 of hydrochloric acid ( ACS grade , Caledon ) at 70 – 80 °C for 1 h . This was transferred to a 15 ml tube and diluted to 10 ml . Filtration and gold measurement was done as described in the paragraph above . After obtaining the blood concentrations of nanoparticles , we found how many AuNPs remained in the blood of a control mouse at a particular time t and then divided it by the amount that was in the Zombie mice ( constant concentration ) . This gave us the correction factor . Thus , the formula for the corrected nanoparticle accumulation due to passive pathways ( passive NP ) that account for the decaying nanoparticle concentration in the blood model is : PassiveNP Zombietumourat t ¼ MeasuredNP Zombietumourat t X AUC Controlbloodat t AUC Zombiebloodat t ð 1 Þ where X YZ at t ¼ amountof X in Z organof Y miceattime t I Supplementary Table 6 gives the analysed results . Patient tumour sample acquisition . Sections ( 1 – 2 mm ) of human patient biopsies were obtained from the Ontario Tumour Bank . The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto . The protocol ID is 34558 . All the required guidelines with respect to sample handling and confidentiality were followed . After receiving the samples , they were fixed in the TEM solution ( 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ) for 1 – 2 days before being sent to the Electron Microscopy Facility at the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning for further sample preparation . Sample preparation for TEM . Samples for TEM were prepared by D . Holmyard at SickKids Hospital , who had no knowledge of the sample parameters and sectioned randomly . This ensured the removal of any bias in the sample processing . Samples handed to the facility were in a solution of 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 1 × PBS ( TEM solution ) . The facility then fixed the tumour in 2 % glutaraldehyde in a 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer , rinsed with buffer , postfixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide in buffer , dehydrated in a graded ethanol series followed by propylene oxide , and embedded in Quetoi - Spurr resin . Next , sections of thickness 90 nm were cut on a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome , stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and digitally imaged using a FEI Tecnai 20 TEM . Analysis of TEM images . The variables of interest were tumour type ( 4T1 , MMTV , U87 , PDX and human ) , time point ( 15 min , 1 h ) , particle size ( 15 , 50 and 100 nm ) . the categories measured were blood vessel features ( tight junction , fenestrae and intercellular gap or intracellular gap ) . Manual annotation of TEM images . Images acquired from TEM were stored on a central server . For each organ analysed , we selected at least seven tiled images for annotation . These tiled images contained between 1 and 120 fields of view depending on the size of the blood vessel . Each image contained one vessel to be analysed for its features related to the endothelium ( such as tight junctions , fenestrae , intercellular gaps and intracellular gaps ) and the number of nanoparticles relative to the location within the vessel . We undertook several measures to remove sources of bias . First , each researcher was trained through seminars to recognize the nine features we wanted to annotate : nanoparticles in the blood vessel lumen , on the sidewall , in the endothelial cell vesicle , in the endothelial cell cytoplasm and in extravascular space , and tight junctions , fenestrae , inter - endothelial cell gaps and transcellular channels . Second , we tested the researchers who performed the annotations on two test datasets and provided them feedback on their accuracy before they began labelling the final data . Third , we assigned each vessel image randomly to three independent researchers who did not interact with each other while annotating the images . This ensured the removal of any bias and increased the accuracy due to triplicate measurements . Previous studies did not analyse the data in this manner . Fourth , we provided each researcher with a custom set of FIJI macros and scripts that created an interactive annotation process . The researcher would identify a feature , click on it and press a shortcut key to create a circular annotation that identified the feature ( and modified the image at that circle with a numerical value that corresponded to the feature ) . The annotations were then immediately visible to the user as a colour - coded circle ( colours were assigned using a custom lookup table ) to indicate the what kind of feature it was , such as a tight junction on an endothelial cell or a nanoparticle within the lumen . Fifth , we analysed these annotated images through an automated image analysis pipeline to reduce bias and error when counting thousands of particles . These measures ensured the robustness of quantification . Supplementary Fig . 5 gives the flowchart of analysis . Image analysis of manually annotated TEM images . After annotation by three independent researchers we analysed these images in MATLAB . We obtained a count of each feature by analysing these features from the annotated images . The images to be annotated were rescaled to have intensities between 0 and 235 with all the values greater than 235 corresponding to manual annotations . Each annotated feature had a unique intensity value ; for example , nanoparticles in the lumen were labelled with circles with an intensity of 246 . For each feature , we extracted only pixels that contained the corresponding intensity value . We then separated overlapping annotations using a watershed segmentation and counted the number of regions to quantify the number of instances of each feature in the image for each of the triplicate annotated images . Consensus gaps and quantification of other features . Most of these features are unambiguous in the TEM images with the exception of endothelial cell gaps . To improve the accuracy of this count for the measurement of gaps we collected all the images that had been labelled by at least one researcher as having any type of gap . We reviewed these images one by one and held a vote to determine whether each gap was a transcellular channel , an inter - endothelial gap , a misannotation , an imaging artefact or one of the other features . The revised consensus gaps were re - annotated on the images as new features . For all the other features , we chose the median count from each category counted between the three independent researchers of the same blood vessel . The median was calculated within each image in bins going around the blood vessel ( Spatial correlation analysis section ) . These features were tabulated based on the counts measured for the categories ( blood vessel features and nanoparticle location ) and organized based on the variables tested ( tumour type , particle size and time point ) . Median numbers for each feature were analysed either based on the vessel feature or nanoparticle location . For instance , to calculate the frequency of tight junctions per millimetre of blood vessel perimeter measured within U87 tumours , the number of tight junctions measured per vessel was divided by the perimeter of a vessel . The mean was calculated across all the vessels imaged from U87 tumours . This is the mean reported in Supplementary Tables 1 and 8 . The associated s . d . for each feature for a particular tumour type was calculated assuming a Poisson distribution , ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ mean ´ vesselperimeter p Þ = vesselperimeter I . For instance , to calculate the percentages for 50 nm , 30 min , 4T1 we would first take all six images from the first replicate mouse of that condition . We would sum all the nanoparticles within these six images and calculate the percentage in the lumen , or frequency of nanoparticle per cross - sectional area and so on . Then , these calculations would be repeated for each of the replicate animals and values from each replicate would be used to derive the mean and s . d . These results are reported in Supplementary Table 2 . Spatial correlation analysis . To quantify whether the presence of any type of feature was correlated with extravascular nanoparticles , we analysed the correlation with respect to the blood vessel . We traced the outline of each blood vessel and marked it as a new annotation . We loaded this vessel annotation in MATLAB and identified the perimeter of the blood vessel . We divided this perimeter into ten equal segments and all the extravascular nanoparticles and endothelial cell features were then assigned the nearest perimeter segment . Collected over all images , we NATURE MATERiALS | www . nature . com / naturematerials Articles Nature Materials then evaluated the Spearman correlation coefficient , ρ , of each type of blood vessel feature against the number of extravascular nanoparticles present in its proximity . Measurement of length and surface area for blood vessel and gaps . To determine the total length of the blood vessels examined , we measured the major axis Feret diameter of each traced blood vessel . To measure the surface area of the blood vessels , we calculated the perimeter of the traced vessel and multiplied it by the thickness of the slice ( 90 nm ) . To determine the surface area of the gaps , we measured the length of each annotated gap and multiplied it by the thickness of the slice . Mathematical modelling of extravasation and comparison with intratumoural accumulation of nanoparticles . To determine if the observed number of holes was sufficient to explain the observed accumulation , we simulated the distribution of nanoparticles in the tumour . Previous models of nanoparticle transport were limited because they could not account for the organization of the blood vessel architecture and density in the tumour . We performed 3D microscopy of U87 - MG tumours and visualized the blood vessel architecture using GSL1 - Cy3 . The tissue processing and staining methods are explained in detail in previous sections . Tissue slices were imaged using a Zeiss Lightsheet Z . 1 microscope at an isotropic resolution of 2 µ m and a field of view of 1 . 2 mm in all dimensions . The blood vessel images were segmented using a manually trained random forest algorithm implemented in Ilastik . Binary segmented blood vessel images were used for diffusion simulations . Mathematical formulation of diffusion simulation . The dynamics of nanoparticles in the tumour can be described using the diffusion equation : ∂ n ∂ t þ ∇ v n x ; t ð Þ ð Þ ¼ D ∇ 2 n x ; t ð Þ þ R n x ; t ð Þ ; x ; t ð Þ ð 2 Þ where v is a velocity field . Short of being able to solve this analytically , we numerically simulated this partial differential equation using a Euler method on a cubic lattice . The upper limit of D was calculated using the Stokes – Einstein equation : D ¼ k B T 6 π η r ð 3 Þ where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T the absolute temperature , η the dynamic viscosity and r the radius of the spherical particle . Using the dynamic viscosity of blood η = 2 . 87 mPa s – 1 and room temperature , we estimated the diffusion coefficient in blood to be D ≤ 1 . 5 μ m 2 s – 1 . In the tumour microenvironment , D is further limited by the collagen concentration . Previous experimental measurements of D estimated it to be around 0 . 05 μ m 2 s – 1 , which is what we used 28 . We assumed that the contribution of a velocity field to the dynamics of the nanoparticles was negligible . Effectively , we set v = 0 . Vasculature images obtained through the CLARITY technique were segmented to obtain vasculature data that we could use in our simulations ( images available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 6084 / m9 . figshare . 7485770 ) . Neumann boundary conditions were set along the vasculature so that particles did not enter or exit through the endothelial cells , ∇ n x ; t ð Þ ¼ 0 I . Locations along the vasculature were randomly selected for the fenestrae . The source terms in our equation are those holes that provide the diffusive flow of particles from inside the vessels to the tumour microenvironment . The concentrations at these hole locations were set to be equal to the observed concentrations inside the vessels as a function of time , that is : n 0 t ð Þ ¼ 0 : 5407e � 0 : 3465 t þ 0 : 4593e � 5 : 122 t ð 4 Þ This equation was fitted from the normalized observed pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles in CD1 nude mice that bore U87 - MG tumours . Simulations were run to obtain the concentration profiles at 30 min postinjection , with time steps of 0 . 25 s . All the code for these simulations can be found at https : / / github . com / jbRothschild / nano - extravasation . Comparison of accumulation in observed versus simulated distributions . Accumulation in the simulated tumour images was determined by taking the mean numerical value of the voxels in the simulated image and multiplying it by the normalization factor of the pharmacokinetic curve , 55 % ID g – 1 , which gives the concentration of particles in the tumour microenvironment . The total accumulation in the tumour was determined by multiplying this value by 1 g because this was the standard tumour size used in this study . Effect of caveolin - 1 knockout on nanoparticle tumour accumulation . Age - matched Cav - 1 knockout ( stock no . 007083 , strain B6 . Cg - Cav1 / J ) and control C57Bl / 6J ( stock no . 000664 , strain C57BL / 6J ) mice were ordered from Charles River . B16 . F10 melanoma tumours were induced by injecting 200 , 000 cells suspended in 0 . 2 ml of PBS into the right flank of the mice . At 2 weeks post - tumour induction , 2 × 10 13 50 nm PEGylated AuNPs were injected intravenously into these tumour - bearing mice via the tail vein . The nanoparticles were circulated for 4 h and the organs were dissected from mice for acid digestion and processing . The nanoparticle accumulation in organs was measured using ICP - MS using the same procedure as described above . Effect of tumour vessel normalization . Age - matched CD - 1 nude mice were ordered from Charles River and U87 - MG glioblastoma tumours were induced as described above . At 3 weeks post - tumour induction , the tumour vessel normalization protocol was induced by intravenous injection of 5 mg kg – 1 DC101 via the tail vein and left for 2 days . This is in accordance with work from the Jain lab . Next , 2 × 10 12 50 nm PEGylated AuNPs were injected intravenously into these tumour - bearing mice via the tail vein . the nanoparticles were circulated for 4 h and organs were dissected from mice for acid digestion and processing . The nanoparticle accumulation in organs was measured using ICP - MS using the same procedure as described above . Intravital imaging . Mammary tumour MMTV - PyMT Mice . Intravital microscopy for MMTV - PyMT mice was performed as described previously 51 . Briefly , 150 µ l of a 1 mg ml – 1 GSL1 - Cy3 solution was injected into the mice via the tail vein to label blood vessels . Then , the mice were anaesthetized with 4 % isoflurane ( at 21 % oxygen , balance nitrogen ) and surgery was performed with 2 . 5 % isoflurane . The ventral surface of the mouse was prepared for surgery with isopropyl alcohol and a ventral midline incision was then made with sterilized scissors . The inguinal mammary fat pad was surgically exposed and a glass microscope slide was glued to the skin behind the mammary gland . The glass slide was rotated to expose the inner surface of the mammary gland , and the mouse was transferred to the microscopic stage . During imaging , isoflurane was reduced to the lowest concentration at which the mouse did not react to pain . We used an oximeter probe ( MouseOx , Starr Life Sciences , ) to monitor and display the heart rate ( beats per minute ) , the arterial oxygen saturation of the blood ( % ) and the distension of blood vessels ( μ m ) caused by the pulse and breathing . This real - time feedback allowed us to adjust the anaesthesia levels to the individual mouse . During the imaging procedure , isoflurane was delivered in a humidified mix of nitrogen and oxygen ( at least 21 % ) , with oxygen adjusted to achieve a > 95 % oxygen saturation of the arterial blood as measured with an oximeter probe . Mice received 50 – 100 μ l h – 1 of saline intraperitoneally and were covered with a recirculating heated water blanket during imaging . The 50 nm AuNPs were synthesized as above . These nanoparticles were labelled with Alexa Fluor 647 using protocols published before 52 , 53 . Of these Alexa Fluor 647 - labelled AuNPs , 1 × 10 12 were injected intravenously into the mice via the tail vein . Imaging was performed using a custom microlensed spinning disk confocal microscope ( Solamere Technologies ) equipped with an ICCD camera ( XR - Mega - 10EX S - 30 , Stanford Photonics ) , 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 nm solid - state laser lines and selective emission filters . Images were collected at 60 s intervals with exposure times of ~ 330 ms . 4T1 Mammary tumours . This syngeneic tumour model was generated by injecting 1 million 4T1 cells in BALB / c mice ( 6 weeks old ) . The injection site was the fifth inguinal mammary fat pad . The tumour was allowed to grow for 14 days . On the day of imaging , the hair was removed using a shaver . Before putting the mice on the microscope stage for imaging , 150 µ l of a 1 mg ml – 1 GSL1 - Cy3 solution was injected via the tail vein to label blood vessels . Immediately thereafter , the mouse was anaesthetized with isoflurane at 5 % isoflurane in oxygen , initially in a chamber and then transferred to a supine position with a nose cone at 2 . 5 % isoflurane in 0 . 5 l min – 1 oxygen for anaesthesia maintenance . In the supine position , the legs and arms were immobilized to the stage by using tape . A heat lamp was used to maintain the body temperature , which was monitored using a rectal probe . The tumour was exposed by making incisions around it and peeling it off away from the peritoneum . Care was taken to not cause any vasculature injury . The skin that surrounded the tumour was used to pin down the tumour using needles . The tumour was wetted with a few drops of PBS and then a coverslip was placed on top and taped . This liquid layer avoided vessel collapse and maintained the refractive index . The stage could be moved in XY . The microscope used for this imaging was an upright Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a × 20 water - immersion Plan Apochromat objective lens with a 1 . 0 numerical aperture . It could be moved in the Z axis . A drop of water was put on the glass slide . Then , the objective was brought to the glass slide to be immersed . The laser power was set to 5 – 10 % and the signal - to - noise ratio was maximized by adjusting the gain . Other parameters were pinhole size of 1 Airy unit , acquisition rate of 1 image per second with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels ( without averaging ) . The scanning was one - directional scanning and laser speed was the maximum . The 50 nm AuNPs were synthesized as above . These nanoparticles were labelled with Alexa Fluor 647 using protocols published before 52 , 53 . Of these Alexa Fluor 647 labelled AuNPs , 1 × 10 12 were injected intravenously into the mice via the tail vein . Measurement of D in collagen before and after fixation . Collagen solutions ( 5 mg ml – 1 ) that contained 1 . 25 × 10 11 AuNPs and 50 % DMEM complete were prepared in a 1 . 6 ml semi - micro cuvette ( Biomart ) . Gels were formed at 37 °C for 1 h . The fixation sample was then incubated with an additional 2 ml of TEM NATURE MATERiALS | www . nature . com / naturematerials Articles Nature Materials fixative ( 4 % formaldehyde , 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 1 × PBS and 1 µ g ml – 1 of Cy3 ) overnight to fix the collagen . Samples without fixation were incubated with PBS . Collagen was assumed to be fixed when the Cy3 front reached the bottom of the gel . D was then measured using a Malvern Zetasizer instrument with 30 s acquisition time . Sample - size simulations . A 3D microscopy image of a U87 - MG xenograft tumour was thresholded for GSL1 positive blood vessels using Ilastik . The resulting image was cropped to 300 × 300 × 300 voxels and then supersampled to 600 × 600 × 600 voxels to provide a resolution of 1 µ m in all dimensions . Gaps were simulated in MATLAB using three distribution scenarios : first , an even distribution in which gaps were randomly chosen from all the surface voxels in the blood vessel network ; second , a localized distribution in which two points were randomly chosen on the blood vessel surface and all the gaps were randomly assigned to surface voxels within 50 µ m of the original two points ; third , clusters of 50 points were randomly chosen on the blood vessel surface and all the gaps were randomly assigned to surface voxels within 10 µ m of any clustering point . Distributions are shown in the section Statement on sampling in Supplementary Discussion . the vessel network was skeletonized using the Skeleton3D plugin for MATLAB ( www . mathworks . com / matlabcentral / fileexchange / 43400 - skeleton3d ) . Points on the skeleton were randomly chosen as locations of a TEM slice and 20 µ m x 20 µ m sections were analysed for the presence of a gap . To estimate the coefficient of variance of 10 vessels , 10 vessels were tested to derive an estimate of the gap density and then this process was repeated 300 times to measure the coefficient of variance of that estimate . The entire procedure was then repeated for 20 vessels , 30 vessels , … to 1 , 000 vessels . As we actually examined 380 vessels , the coefficient of variance we should expect is about 0 . 25 , which means that we observed 27 gaps with a s . d . of ~ 5 gaps . Statistical analysis . Prism ( GraphPad Software ) and MATLAB were used for the data analysis and graph plotting . All the scatter plot data are expressed as mean ± s . d . A two - way analysis of variance with a Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used to determine the statistical significance of the gold and platinum content in the Zombie and control animals ( Fig . 4a ) . The degree of freedom was 3 and the F value was 1 . 772 . The exact sample sizes for each figure that required statistical analysis are summarized in Supplementary Tables 10 and 11 . The spatial correlation coefficient was determined using the Spearman correlation analysis in MATLAB . In total , 126 vessels were analysed . The rest were excluded due to ( 1 ) no extravascular nanoparticles , ( 2 ) no Zombie experiment images and / or ( 3 ) TEM images at 1 h instead of 0 . 25 h ( the correlation is weaker at longer time points ) . Spearman ρ and P values are given in Supplementary Table 12 . Ethics statement . All the experiments that involved animal procedures and human sample acquisition were conducted in accordance with the animal use protocols approved by the University of Toronto . Reporting summary .
