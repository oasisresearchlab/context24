In a companion study , we report that myosin - 15 nucleates actin filament ( “F - actin” ) assembly and identify a progressive hearing loss mutation ( p . D1647G , “ jordan ” ) which disrupts stereocilia elongation by inhibiting actin polymerization . Here , we present cryo - EM structures of myosin - 15 bound to F - actin , providing a framework for interpreting deafness mutations and their impacts on myosin - stimulated actin assembly . Rigor myosin - 15 evokes conformational changes in F - actin yet maintains flexibility in actin’s D - loop , which mediates inter - subunit contacts , while the jordan mutant locks the D - loop in a single conformation . ADP - bound myosin - 15 also locks the D - loop , which correspondingly blunts actin - polymerization stimulation . We propose myosin - 15 enhances polymerization by bridging actin protomers , regulating nucleation efficiency by modulating actin’s structural plasticity in a myosin nucleotide - state dependent manner . This tunable regulation of actin polymerization could be harnessed to precisely control stereocilium height .

Each hair cell assembles a staircase - shaped mechanosensory hair bundle during development , which contains three rows of stereocilia of increasing height . Stereocilia are primarily composed of parallel bundles of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) crosslinked to form a para - crystalline array ( DeRosier et al . , 1980 ; Tilney et al . , 1980 ) . Stereocilia develop from microvilli that undergo an exquisite morphogenetic program characterized by F - actin elongation and bundling , presumed to be orchestrated by coordinated actin polymerization and bundling protein engagement ( Tilney et al . , 1992 ) . Once a stereocilium is established , slow actin dynamics maintain its architecture throughout adult life ( Drummond et al . , 2015 ; Narayanan et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . Finely - tuned regulation of actin dynamics is critical for stereocilium height determination , and mutations in actin and its regulatory factors are frequently associated with hearing loss ( Barr - Gillespie , 2015 ; Drummond et al . , 2012 ) . Nevertheless , the molecular mechanisms which precisely define the height of individual stereocilia during development and maintain them for a lifetime remain elusive . Unconventional myosin - 15 ( encoded by the Myo15 gene in mouse , and MYO15A in humans ) is a plus - end directed molecular motor essential for stereocilia development and maintenance ( Anderson et al . , 2000 ; Belyantseva et al . , 2003 ; Belyantseva et al . , 2005 ; Bird et al . , 2014 ; Fang et al . , 2015 ; Probst et al . , 1998 ; Wang et al . , 1998 ) . Over 300 mutations have been mapped to the human MYO15A gene that cause autosomal recessive non - syndromic deafness , DNFB3 ( Rehman et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 1998 ) . Within hair cells , myosin - 15 localizes to the distal tips of stereocilia , the major sites of actin turnover which are enriched with F - actin plus ( “barbed” ) ends ( Belyantseva et al . , 2003 ; Belyantseva et al . , 2005 ; Drummond et al . , 2015 ; Narayanan et al . , 2015 ; Rzadzinska et al . , 2004 ) . In mice homozygous for the Myo15 “ shaker 2 ” allele ( p . C1779Y ) , myosin - 15 trafficking is disrupted in nascent stereocilia ( Belyantseva 2003 ) , resulting in failure of stereocilia to elongate and profound hearing loss ( Probst et al . , 1998 ) . Myosin - 15 transports whirlin ( WHRN ) , EPS8 , GPSM2 , and GNAI3 to stereocilia tips , an “elongation network” of interacting proteins required for stereocilium biogenesis , each member of which .

As EPS8 is a known actin - binding protein ( ABP ) which exhibits filament bundling and plus - end capping activity ( Disanza et al . , 2004 ; Hertzog et al . , 2010 ) , it has been proposed that myosin - 15 mediates stereocilia growth by transporting elongation network components to the tip compartment , where they serve as the regulatory machinery governing F - actin assembly ( Belyantseva et al . , 2005 ; Delprat et al . , 2005 ; Manor et al . , 2011 ; Mauriac et al . , 2017 ; Tadenev et al . , 2019 ) . Nevertheless , the functional consequences of specific myosin - 15 mutations remain poorly understood due to the absence of structural data and limited functional characterization of the myosin - 15 protein . In a companion manuscript , we identified the myosin - 15 missense mutation p . D1647G , hereafter referred to as the “ jordan ” mutant ( Figure 1A ) , in a forward genetic screen for lesions leading to progressive hearing loss in mice ( Moreland , 2021 ) . The jordan mouse develops abnormally short stereocilia which retract during aging . Although its actin - activated ATPase activity and F - actin binding affinity are somewhat compromised , purified jordan myosin - 15 is nevertheless an active motor , and WHRN , EPS8 , GPSM2 and GNAI3 localize to the tips of developing stereocilia in the jordan mouse , leading us to hypothesize that myosin - 15 could control stereocilium height through additional mechanisms . Consistently , we found that the motor - domain containing myosin - 15 S1 fragment dramatically stimulates actin polymerization in vitro , with the nucleotide - free “rigor” state specifically acting as a nucleation factor , while the jordan mutant instead suppresses actin assembly ( Moreland , 2021 ) . Early studies of the S1 fragment of skeletal muscle myosin demonstrated its capacity to nucleate actin polymerization in vitro ( Fievez et al . , 1997 ; Lheureux et al . , 1993 ; Miller et al . , 1988 ) , but a physiological role for this activity has not , to our knowledge , been reported . Our studies suggest myosin - 15 directly regulates actin dynamics in stereocilia , but the underlying molecular mechanism , and how it is disrupted by a single amino acid substitution in the jordan mutant , remain unknown . F - actin assembly and disassembly are tightly regulated by dozens of ABPs , including severing proteins , capping proteins , and nucleators , whose activities must be precisely coordinated to construct .

These ABPs frequently utilize their actin - binding interfaces to modulate G - actin monomer / F - actin protomer conformation and thereby fine - tune actin polymerization dynamics ( Crevenna et al . , 2015 ; Dominguez and Holmes , 2011 ; Pollard , 2016 ) . The structurally polymorphic actin subdomain 2 , or “D - loop” , which mediates longitudinal interactions between F - actin protomers , plays a prominent role in this conformational regulation ( Das et al . , 2020 ; Durer et al . , 2012 ; Galkin et al . , 2010 ) . Several myosin motors have been reported to modulate actin’s conformation through direct contacts with the D - loop upon F - actin binding ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ; Mentes et al . , 2018 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2016 ) , and distinct actin conformations were visualized at the Mg - ADP and rigor stages of myosin - 6’s mechanochemical cycle ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ) . This led us to hypothesize that reciprocal conformational changes at the actin - myosin interface could be harnessed by myosin - 15 during its mechanochemical cycle to precisely regulate F - actin polymerization dynamics to control stereocilium height . Here we report the cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) structure of the rigor wild - type myosin - 15 motor domain bound to F - actin at 2 . 84 Å resolution , to our knowledge the highest - resolution actomyosin structure to date , providing a framework for broadly interpreting deafness mutations in the motor domain and at the actin - myosin interface . To probe the mechanisms by which myosin - 15 regulates F - actin assembly , we also obtained cryo - EM structures of F - actin alone ( 2 . 82 Å ) , rigor jordan myosin - 15 ( 3 . 76 Å ) , and Mg - ADP wild - type myosin - 15 ( 3 . 63 Å ) bound to F - actin . The unprecedented resolution of our F - actin alone structure reveals a region of the D - loop ( residues G48 - Q49 ) that is structurally flexible but nevertheless primarily adopts a mixture of two conformations . Rigor wild - type myosin - 15 engagement elicits rearrangements at the actin - myosin interface which are propagated through the actin structure , yet the D - loop continues to adopt two conformations . Binding of the jordan mutant evokes similar overall rearrangements but strikingly locks the D - loop in a single conformation , as does Mg - ADP wild - type myosin - 15 , which shows reduced F - actin stimulation relative to the rigor state in polymerization assays . Our studies suggest strongly - bound myosin - 15 promotes F - actin assembly by reinforcing longitudinal contacts between actin protomers with a nucleation efficiency controlled by the .

We propose this tunable direct regulation of actin assembly dynamics facilitates precise control of stereocilia height by myosin - 15 in vivo , which is completely compromised by the jordan deafness mutation . Results : Cryo - EM reconstructions of actomyosin - 15 complexes and bare F - actin Using cryo - EM and the iterative - real space helical symmetry reconstruction ( IHRSR ) procedure as implemented in RELION - 3 ( Egelman , 2007 ; Zivanov et al . , 2018 ) we determined structures of a wild - type mouse myosin - 15 construct containing the motor domain and 2 IQ motifs ( Bird et al . , 2014 ) ( “MD - 2IQ” , Figure 1A ) bound to F - actin at a 1 : 1 stoichiometry in the rigor and Mg - ADP states at an average resolution of 2 . 84 Å and 3 . 63 Å , respectively ( STAR Methods ) . We additionally determined the structure of the jordan deafness mutant bound to F - actin at 3 . 76 Å resolution ( Figures 1B , S1A , B ) . Our rigor wild - type structure represents a substantial improvement in resolution over previously reported actomyosin reconstructions ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ; Mentes et al . , 2018 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2016 ) , facilitating building an accurate atomic model of the myosin - 15 motor domain ( Figure 1C ) , which has not , to our knowledge , previously been structurally visualized in the absence or presence of F - actin . As has been reported in other cryo - EM studies of actomyosin ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ; Mentes et al . , 2018 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2016 ) , the local resolution of these reconstructions is highest in the center of the filament and decreases radially outwards towards the distal tip of the myosin lever arm ( Figure S1B ) . For all three complexes , the resolution of F - actin and the actin - myosin interface extends beyond 3 Å , yielding models with unambiguous side - chain density within these areas ( Figures 1D , E ; S1B ) . Most side chains in the motor domain are clearly resolved and secondary structures can be identified in and around the distal converter domain ( Figures 1E , S1B ) . To visualize structural changes evoked in F - actin by myosin - 15 , we also reconstructed bare F - actin at a global resolution of 2 . 82 Å ( Figures 1B ; S1A , B ) , to our knowledge the highest resolution mammalian F - actin structure reported to .

This density map facilitated direct model building and refinement of actin’s bound Mg - ADP and all actin residues except the first five at the protein’s flexible N terminus . Structural interpretation of deafness - causing myosin - 15 mutations Within the motor domain of myosin - 15 , a total of 59 missense mutations targeting 58 residues have been identified in DFNB3 patients ( Rehman et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Of these 58 residues , 2 are located in disordered regions which were not resolved in our reconstruction : the remaining 56 can be mapped onto the structure ( Figure 2A ) . Sequence alignment of the mouse and human myosin - 15 motor domains shows 54 of the 56 residues are identical and 2 of them are highly similar ( Figure S2 ) . Examining the distribution of these deafness - causing mutations leads us to classify them into four groups ( Figure 2A : unless otherwise noted , residues cited correspond to the human protein ) . Mutations in the first group are found in the core of the motor domain and are likely to disrupt proper folding and thereby completely compromise function . For example , the p . S1465P mutation introduces a proline in the middle of a long helix and the p . A1532T / p . A1535D mutations substitute alanine with a polar or charged amino acid in the hydrophobic core ( Figure 2B ) , all of which we anticipate will severely impede folding . This group additionally includes mouse C1779 , the site of the pathogenic p . C1779Y deafness mutation in the shaker 2 allele , contrary to its originally predicted location at an actin - binding interface ( Probst et al . , 1998 ) . This residue sits in a hydrophobic core surrounded by mouse I1297 , L1275 , A1308 and V1777 ( Figure S3A ) , where substitution with a bulky hydrophilic tyrosine would be anticipated to disrupt the proper folding of the transducer . Consistent with this interpretation , recombinantly expressed shaker 2 ( p . C1779Y ) motor domain is a soluble aggregate when purified and subjected to size exclusion chromatography ( Moreland , 2021 ) . Furthermore , the human counterpart ( A1324 ) of mouse A1308 , which is adjacent to C1779 ( Figure S3A ) , was also found to be substituted with the highly polar residue aspartic acid in a pedigree with profound deafness ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) , consistent with disruption of the hydrophobic core resulting in misfolding and aggregation . .

This interaction likely plays a stabilizing role in the cleft , and the charge inversion p . K1541E mutation is anticipated to disrupt it and hinder cleft closure . The third group are located in consensus ATPase motifs , including switch I , switch II , and the P - loop . These mutations are expected to have a deleterious impact on the mechanochemical cycle by impeding ATP binding and / or hydrolysis ( Figure 2D and Figure S2 ) . Finally , a fourth group of mutations are distributed in solvent exposed loop regions with no obvious pattern ( Figure 2A ) . We speculate these residues mediate binding contacts with yet to be identified partner proteins or intramolecular contacts involved in regulating myosin - 15’s motor function , which could include an interface between the motor domain and the large 133 kDa N - terminal domain of myosin - 15 isoform 1 ( MYO15 - 1 ; Figure 1A ) that is required for postnatal stereocilia maintenance ( Fang et al . , 2015 ) . Our structural mapping analysis suggests that mutations in myosin - 15 cause pathology by either interfering with canonical myosin - 15 ATPase motor activity , or with non - canonical functions such as mediating protein - protein interactions at the stereocilia tips . A structurally diversified myosin - 15 - actin interface We next undertook a detailed analysis of the myosin - 15 - F - actin interface to identify specific contacts which could contribute to myosin - 15’s F - actin nucleation activity . We also examined the interface for contacts which might be impacted by deafness mutations in both myosin - 15 and g - actin ( encoded by the ACTG1 gene in humans ) , one of the primary actin isoforms expressed in hair cells ( Figure S3B ) . Like other myosins , myosin - 15 employs conserved structural elements to interact with F - actin : the Helix - Loop - Helix ( HLH ) motif , the cardiomyopathy ( CM ) loop , loop 2 , loop 3 , and the activation loop ( Figure 3A and S4A ) . However , residue - level interactions have diversified among .

Myosin - 15’s HLH motif ( I1641 - P1671 ) mediates the major contact with F - actin through its engagement with two longitudinally adjacent actin subunits ( which we here refer to as subunits “i” and “i + 2” ) along a protofilament ( Figure 3A ) . The first helix of the HLH includes myosin - 15 residue D1647 , the site of the p . D1647G mutation in the jordan allele , which forms hydrogen bonds with S350 and T351 on subdomain 1 of subunit i ( Figure 3B ) . Notably , D1647 is highly conserved among myosin supefamily members , indicating this interaction is likely broadly important for myosin function ( Figure S2 ) . Mutation of this site in myosin - 2 resulted in a ten - fold reduction of F - actin binding affinity ( Furch et al . , 2000 ) , and the F - actin binding of jordan mutant myosin - 15 is also substantially decreased ( Moreland , 2021 ) . In the loop portion of the HLH , a pair of hydrophobic residues ( F1651 and P1652 ) inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by subdomains 1 and 3 of actin subunit i and the D - loop of subunit i + 2 ( Figure 3C ) , where L349 of subunit i closely engages with myosin - 15 F1651 . The g - actin mutation L349M causes profound deafness in human patients ( Sloan - Heggen et al . , 2016 ) , and we anticipate replacement of leucine by the bulkier methionine impairs myosin - 15 engagement by preventing access to this pocket ( Figure 3C and S3B ) . Additionally , Q1653 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of subunit i residue G146 ( Figure S4B ) . The second helix engages with the N - terminal portion of subunit i + 2’s D - loop through a network of electrostatic interactions . Residue K1662 of myosin - 15 forms a hydrogen bond with the sidechain of D - loop residue Q49 , and myosin - 15 Y1665 also forms a possible N - H···π bond with this actin residue ( Figure S4B ) . The activation loop ( I1634 - G1640 ) preceding the HLH motif has been suggested to activate myosins through contacts with actin’s negatively charged N terminus ( Varkuti et al . , 2012 ; Varkuti et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , K1637 forms a possible salt bridge with subunit i + 2 residue 4E , partially stabilizing actin’s flexible N terminus ( Figure S4C ) . This ionic interaction is present in both the Mg - ADP and rigor states ( Figure S4C ) , indicating that it is likely involved in the initial weak - to - strong F - actin binding transition in the case of myosin - 15 . Loop 2 has also been implicated in mediating initial contacts during .

This region is largely disordered in our structures , suggesting loop 2 engagement is dispensable for strong binding of myosin - 15 to F - actin . Discontinuous density is present for several residues extending from the C - terminal base of loop 2 , which orients towards the N terminus of actin and may form weak interactions ( Figure S4D ) . This is in striking contrast to non - muscle myosin - 1c ( hereafter “myosin - 1” ) or non - muscle myosin - 2c ( hereafter “myosin - 2” ) , where loop 2 is either partially or fully ordered at the strongly - bound interface ( Mentes et al . , 2018 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2016 ) . The CM loop adopts a beta hairpin fold and packs tightly against subdomain 1 of subunit i ( Figure 3A and 3D ) . In contrast to the CM loops of myosin - 1 and myosin - 2 , which primarily engage in hydrophobic interactions with F - actin ( Mentes et al . , 2018 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2016 ) , myosin - 15’s CM loop - F - actin hydrophobic interface is minimal and is instead dominated by a network of electrostatic interactions . Specifically , the non - conserved residue R1520 at the tip of the CM loop likely mediates a myosin - 15 - specific salt bridge with actin D56 . Similar to myosin - 1 , the highly conserved residue E1521 mediates electrostatic contacts with actin residues K336 and Y337 . The side chain of T1525 also forms a hydrogen bond with actin E334 , which is not observed for myosin - 1 or myosin - 2 ( Figure 3D ) . Myosin - 15 possesses a relatively short loop 3 which nevertheless mediates substantial contacts with subdomain 1 of subunit i + 2 . Compared with myosin - 1 and myosin - 2 , myosin - 15’s loop 3 assumes a distinct conformation to form divergent interactions ( Figure S4E ) . Notably , myosin - 15 P1679 makes Van der Waals contacts with actin N92 and R95 , and M1678 sits in a shallow hydrophobic groove cradled by actin Y91 , V96 , A97 and P98 . This interface is further strengthened by a probable salt bridge between myosin K1677 and actin E99 ( Figure 3E ) . Collectively , we observe numerous myosin - 15 - specific interactions with F - actin , consistent with specialization of this interface for myosin - 15 function in stereocilia . Rigor myosin - 15 evokes structural changes in F - actin while maintaining D - loop flexibility .

Consistent with previously reported actomyosin structures ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ; Mentes et al . , 2018 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2016 ) , the overall conformation of actin in the presence and absence of myosin - 15 is highly similar , with a global RMSD of 0 . 51 Å ( Figure 4A ) . We primarily observe remodeling adjacent to the myosin - 15 HLH , which is propagated through the structure into a global compression of the filament along the longitudinal axis clearly visible in a morph between the density maps of bare F - actin and rigor actomyosin - 15 ( Video S1 ) . Consistently , the helical rise decreases 0 . 12 Å upon myosin - 15 binding , with no substantial alteration of the helical twist ( Figure S1C ) . The short a - helix in actin subunit i which forms contacts with D1647 shifts slightly towards the minus end to mediate this compression ( Figure 4B ) . This is accommodated by rearrangements in the D - loop of subunit i + 2 , which is also engaged by the myosin - 15 HLH . Several recent high - resolution cryo - EM studies of F - actin have indicated that the D - loop is structurally dynamic within the context of the filament ( Chou and Pollard , 2019 ; Das et al . , 2020 ; Merino et al . , 2018 ; Pospich et al . , 2020 ) . At a high threshold ( 0 . 036 RMS ) our bare F - actin map features ambiguity surrounding residues G48 and Q49 , despite clear density for all other residues in the D - loop ( Figure 4C ) . However , at a lower threshold ( 0 . 025 RMS ) , the unprecedented resolution of our map reveals two continuous paths for the backbone , allowing two distinct conformations of the D - loop to be modeled : an “In” conformation where the main - chain of G48 flips in towards the center of the filament and Q49 faces the solvent , and an “Out” conformation where the main - chain of G48 is exposed and Q49 is buried in the center of the D - loop ( Figures 4C , S5 ) . Based on the respective strengths of the 2 density paths , the “Out” conformation is predominant in the bare F - actin structure , likely stabilized by an interaction between the side chain of Q49 of subunit i + 2 and the side chain of Y169 from the adjacent subunit i ( Figure 4C ) . Upon rigor myosin - 15 binding , the D - loop transitions to primarily being in the “In” state ( Figure 4B , D ) , but displaced 2 . 7 Å outward from the filament axis relative to the bare F - actin .

Nevertheless , at a lower threshold ( 0 . 028 RMS ) , density resembling the “Out” conformation in bare actin is clearly visible ( Figure 4D , Video S2 ) , suggesting that rigor myosin - 15 engages its binding site while maintaining F - actin’s intrinsic structural plasticity in the D - loop . The myosin - 15 jordan deafness mutant locks the D - loop in the “In” conformation To gain insight into structural mechanisms underlying the jordan mutant’s suppression of actin assembly and disruption of stereocilia growth ( Moreland , 2021 ) , we next compared the rigor structures of wild - type and jordan mutant actomyosin - 15 . The overall conformations of the motor domains are essentially indistinguishable , arguing the jordan mutation does not grossly compromise myosin - 15’s structure ( Figure S6A ) . The D1647G substitution abolishes the contacts formed between D1647 and actin residues S350 and T351 ( Figure 5A ) without disrupting the conformation and positioning of the HLH or discernibly perturbing any other contacts at the myosin - 15 - actin interface ( Figure S6B - E ) . We next examined the structures for global differences in actin conformation , hypothesizing these could underlie the differential effects upon actin polymerization . Morphing the density maps reveals minimal changes , and the refined helical parameters of the reconstructions are nearly identical ( Figure S1C and Video S3 ) , indicating the jordan mutation does not substantially impact the global structural rearrangements in F - actin evoked by myosin - 15 . Consistently , the short a - helix comprising S350 and T351 of subunit i still undergoes a shift indistinguishable from that observed in the wild - type reconstruction ( Figure 5B ) , indicating this conformational transition is not solely evoked by contacts formed with D1647 and is instead likely an allosteric effect driven by HLH engagement . Collectively , these data suggest that the jordan mutation also does not grossly disrupt the actin - myosin - 15 interface or myosin - 15’s conformational regulation of F - actin . We thus turned to an alternative hypothesis , that the jordan mutant could disrupt actin structural plasticity , rather than global actin conformation .

Density for the “Out” conformation , on the other hand , is completely absent , demonstrating that the jordan mutant locks the D - loop in the “In” conformation and eliminates its flexibility ( Video S4 ) . Thus , the jordan mutation appears to unexpectedly restrict the structural plasticity of the D - loop , presumably through a long - range allosteric effect , rather than eliciting structural rearrangements immediately adjacent to the site of the p . D1647 lesion . While we cannot rule out the possibility that the jordan mutation elicits additional perturbations of myosin - 15 or F - actin structure during other steps of the myosin mechanochemical cycle , wild - type myosin - 15 most potently stimulates F - actin assembly in the absence of nucleotide , arguing the jordan mutant’s defect likely occurs in a strongly - bound state ( Moreland , 2021 ) . As restricted D - loop flexibility is the only distinguishable difference between the two rigor structures , we propose that this dysregulation of actin structural plasticity contributes to inhibition of actin assembly by the jordan mutant ( Moreland , 2021 ) . Our structures furthermore support a key role for actin residue G48 in conferring D - loop flexibility mediating F - actin assembly . In g - actin , the p . G48R substitution ( Figure S3B ) has been documented to cause progressive hearing loss in human patients ( Miyagawa et al . , 2015 ) , phenocopying the jordan mutation . While D - loop flexibility at this position is likely a general feature of mammalian actin isoforms ( Graceffa and Dominguez , 2003 ; Otterbein et al . , 2001 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2015 ) , our data suggest that it is specifically required for efficient actin polymerization in stereocilia . The Mg - ADP state of myosin - 15 stabilizes the D - loop to restrict actin nucleation The ability of myosin - 15 to nucleate F - actin is potently reduced by the presence of ATP ( Moreland , 2021 ) , leading us to hypothesize that other states in the motor’s mechanochemical cycle could have distinct effects on actin polymerization by differentially regulating F - actin conformation , as we have previously reported for myosin - 6 ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ) . We next undertook a detailed comparison of the rigor and Mg - ADP - bound actomyosin - 15 wild - type structures . The overall conformation of the myosin - .

Clear density corresponding to ADP is present in the Mg - ADP state cryo - EM map ( Figure 6A ) , arguing that the observed lack of rearrangements is not due to insufficient nucleotide binding by the motor . Both myosin - 1 and myosin - 6 feature a minor lever - arm swing accompanying ADP release , which has been postulated by us and others to mediate the known force - sensitivity of this step in their mechanochemical cycles ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ; Mentes et al . , 2018 ; Nyitrai and Geeves , 2004 ) . As the myosin - 15 lever arm does not undergo a substantial transition ( Figures 6A , S7A ) , we speculate that ADP release by myosin - 15 is unlikely to be strongly mechanically - gated . We next compared the conformation of F - actin between the rigor and Mg - ADP structures . Consistent with the lack of conformational rearrangements in the motor domain , ADP release by myosin - 15 evokes minimal global conformational changes in F - actin ( Video S5 ) ; correspondingly , the helical rise of the two reconstructions is nearly identical ( Figure S1C ) . Density for the D - loop is clearly resolved in the “In” conformation , positioned as we observed in both the wild - type and jordan mutant rigor reconstructions . However , like the jordan mutant actomyosin - 15 reconstruction , density for the “Out” conformation is completely absent ( Figure 6B - C , Video S6 ) . As rigor jordan myosin - 15 suppresses both D - loop dynamics and actin polymerization , we hypothesized ADP binding would correspondingly reduce the actin - polymerization stimulating activity of wild - type myosin - 15 by also stabilizing the D - loop in the “In” conformation . Consistent with this prediction , we observe a slower rate of actin assembly when saturating Mg - ADP is included along with myosin - 15 in pyrene actin polymerization assays versus nucleotide - free conditions ( Figure 6D ) , with an approximate doubling of the half - time to reach steady - state ( Figure 6E ) . Inclusion of Mg - ADP did not substantially affect the assembly rate of actin alone ( Figure 6D ) , suggesting ADP downregulates the polymerization - stimulating activity of myosin - 15 rather than perturbing F - actin formation . We next sought to determine if ADP binding by myosin - 15 impacted the nucleation or elongation phases of actin polymerization by directly visualizing filament dynamics with Total Internal .

Relative to actin alone , we observed a striking increase in the density of filaments per unit area in the presence of myosin - 15 , which was blunted by the inclusion of saturating Mg - ADP ( Figure 6F , G ) , suggesting a specific effect on actin nucleation . When the growth of individual filament plus ends was monitored ( Figure 6H ) , both nucleotide - free and Mg - ADP myosin - 15 significantly slowed elongation to ~ 7 . 5 nm / s , relative to ~ 16 nm / s for actin alone ( Figure 6I ) . This rate was indistinguishable from that observed in the presence of the rigor jordan mutant in our companion study ( Moreland , 2021 ) . As a further control , the addition of ADP only modestly affected the elongation rate of actin alone ( Figure 6I ) . Myosin - 15’s opposing effects of stimulating nucleation while reducing elongation strongly suggest that the overall increased F - actin assembly rate is dominated by myosin - 15’s effect on stimulating nucleation , as previously reported for muscle myosin S1 ( Fievez et al . , 1997 ; Lheureux et al . , 1993 ) , in a manner which is specifically regulated by myosin - 15 nucleotide state . Discussion : Here , we establish structural mechanisms underpinning myosin - 15’s function in constructing the actin core of stereocilia , a process that is critical for hearing . Our actomyosin - 15 cryo - EM structures , the first myosin - 15 motor domain structures , to our knowledge , of any kind , assign the likely mechanistic deficiencies associated with many DFNB3 deafness mutations , as well as provide a framework for interpreting novel clinical variants ( Figure 2 ) . Many mutations are intuitively anticipated to impact the motor’s mechanochemical cycle . However , our structure also highlights surface substitutions which are not readily interpreted through this lens , suggesting additional functions of the myosin - 15 motor domain important for hearing remain to be identified , such as serving as a protein - protein interaction hub . Our studies additionally reveal how myosin - 15 modulates actin’s structural landscape to enhance F - actin nucleation in a manner controlled by the motor’s nucleotide state . We speculate this activity could be harnessed to provide fine - tuned control of F - actin assembly at stereocilia tips , facilitating the precise control of stereocilia height required for sound detection . .

While substantial D - loop rearrangements accompanying the soluble G - actin to polymerized F - actin conformational transition are well - established ( Dominguez and Holmes , 2011 ) , the extent and functional role of D - loop rearrangements within F - actin remain controversial . Substantially different “open” and “closed” conformations have been reported in cryo - EM reconstructions of F - actin in the presence of stabilizing drugs and actin nucleotide - state analogs ( Merino et al . , 2018 ; Pospich et al . , 2020 ) leading to speculation that an open - to - closed transition is associated with nucleotide hydrolysis and phosphate release concomitant with F - actin polymerization . However , others have reported minimal rearrangements when comparing highly similar conditions , with the D - loop constitutively adopting a closed conformation in F - actin ( Chou and Pollard , 2019 ; Das et al . , 2020 ) . The data we present here reveal the closed D - loop conformation in ADP F - actin to be a mixture of “In” and “Out” states whose occupancy can be manipulated by myosin - 15 engagement . Wild - type rigor myosin - 15 binding retains both the “In” and “Out” D - loop conformations and strongly stimulates actin polymerization , while ADP - bound wild - type myosin - 15 and rigor jordan mutant - 15 both lock the D - loop in the “In” state , with corresponding moderate and striking reductions , respectively , in F - actin - polymerization stimulation activity ( Figure 7 ) . Collectively , these data suggest that the co - existence of the “In” and “Out” D - loop conformations promotes polymerization relative to locking the D - loop in the “In” conformation , a model which is consistent with a recent report demonstrating that constraining D - loop flexibility with short - distance crosslinkers was refractory to actin polymerization and stimulated F - actin disassembly ( Das et al . , 2020 ) . Previous studies have further shown that muscle myosin S1 can rescue polymerization of actin featuring a proteolytically disrupted D - loop ( Wawro et al . , 2005 ) , consistent with a role for myosin in modulating D - loop dynamics during actin polymerization . Nevertheless , additional mechanisms are likely required to explain wild - type myosin - 15’s stimulation of actin polymerization and its striking disruption by the jordan deafness mutation . While actin polymerization by muscle myosin S1 has been subjected to extensive biochemical scrutiny , the exact mechanism remains controversial . Chaussepied and colleagues have suggested that each S1 engages .

Carlier and co - workers , on the other hand , have suggested that each S1 engages two G - actins , forming trimers with an F - actin - like actin - actin longitudinal bond which coalesce into filaments through a mechanism distinct from standard polymerization ( Fievez et al . , 1997 ) . While our data do not directly discriminate between these mechanisms , our observation that the jordan mutation is localized to the HLH interface , which bridges the contact between two longitudinally - adjacent protomers , supports a model in which high - affinity myosin - 15 binding promotes longitudinal interactions to stimulate polymerization ( Figure 7 ) . The modestly lower affinity of ADP - myosin 15 and strikingly lower affinity of the jordan mutant for F - actin , relative to the rigor wild - type ( Moreland , 2021 ) , also likely makes a major contribution to determining their potency in stimulating F - actin formation . This defect occurring at the level of nuclei formation , rather than elongation , is consistent with our observation that F - actin elongation rates are indistinguishable in the presence of ADP - bound or rigor wild - type myosin - 15 ( Figure 6H and I ) , as well as the rigor jordan mutant ( Moreland , 2021 ) , all of which slow actin polymerization relative to G - actin alone . Regardless , diminished affinity of the jordan mutant cannot be the sole explanation for its polymerization defect , as the presence of this myosin , which nevertheless binds F - actin with measurable affinity in an almost identical pose to the wild - type , actually initially suppresses the rate of F - actin formation relative to G - actin alone ( Moreland , 2021 ) . The most parsimonious explanation for this effect is through the suppression of D - loop flexibility as highlighted above , emphasizing the contributions of both myosin - 15 bridging actin monomers to stimulate nucleus formation , and the maintenance of actin conformational plasticity to the accelerated actin polymerization we observe ( Figure 7 ) . Our studies define a biophysical and structural framework for tunable stimulation of actin polymerization by myosin - 15 which could be modulated by the local biochemical environment at the tips of stereocilia , the major sites of actin polymerization . We speculate that hair cells harness the differential efficiency of actin nucleation by myosin - 15 in distinct nucleotide states as a regulatable mechanistic component of stereocilia height control . It is feasible that the ADP - bound state , which substantially .

Within this framework , control over myosin - 15’s actin nucleation could be exerted by the availability of ATP versus ADP ( Moreland , 2021 ) , which has previously been reported to be dynamically maintained by creatine kinase in stereocilia during mechanotransduction and adaptation ( Shin et al . , 2007 ) in a manner which may vary in different species and hair cell subtypes ( Krey and Barr - Gillespie , 2019 ) . Our structural data furthermore suggest that ADP release is unlikely to be mechanically - gated in myosin - 15 , which could facilitate the motor populating a nucleotide - free state in the cell in order to boost its nucleation activity in certain ATP / ADP concentration regimes . In future studies , it will be important to determine the dynamic availability of ATP and ADP in the tip compartment of developing stereocilia , and how myosin - 15’s direct effects on actin polymerization are coordinated with the WHRN - EPS8 - GPSM2 - GNAI3 elongation network that it transports . Other environmental conditions known to impact stereocilium integrity , such as oxidative stress ( Wagner and Shin , 2019 ) , could also potentially impact stimulated actin polymerization by myosin - 15 , both by dysregulation of nucleotide availability and by direct modification of the myosin - 15 protein , disrupting the actin - myosin interface in a manner conceptually analogous to the jordan mutation . Finally , our observation that the jordan mutation occurs at a conserved position suggests that other unconventional myosins could also feasibly stimulate actin polymerization in stereocilia , as well as in diverse physiological contexts beyond hair cells . The mechanistic framework we establish here will broadly facilitate investigating the functional role of unconventional myosins in actin assembly dynamics .

Briefly , Sf 9 cells were seeded at 2 x 10 6 cells / mL in ESF - 921 ( Expression Systems ) , and infected simultaneously with myosin - 15 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 5 . Additional dual - promoter baculoviruses expressing bovine smooth muscle essential ( MYL6 ) and chicken regulatory ( MYL12B ) light chains ( MOI = 5 ) , as well as mouse UNC45B and HSP90AA1 ( MOI = 5 ) were included ( Bird et al . , 2014 ; Pato et al . , 1996 ) . Cells were harvested 48 - 72 hours post - infection and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen . Myosin - 15 motor domains were purified as described ( Moreland , 2021 ) . Briefly , cells were homogenized in Extraction Buffer : 10 mM MOPS , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , 2 μg·mL −1 leupeptin , 1 x protease inhibitor cocktail ( Halt EDTA - free ; Thermo Scientific ) , pH 7 . 2 . Lysates were clarified at 48 , 000 x g for 30 minutes and incubated with FLAG M2 affinity resin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 3 hours at 4 °C . The FLAG resin was then washed in High - Salt Buffer ( 10 mM MOPS , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , 2 μg·mL −1 leupeptin , pH 7 . 2 ) followed by Low - Salt Buffer ( 10 mM MOPS , 60 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , 2 μg·mL −1 leupeptin , pH 7 . 0 ) . Myosin - 15 protein was subsequently eluted with 0 . 2 mg·mL −1 3x FLAG peptide ( American Peptide , CA ) in Low - Salt Buffer . Eluted myosin - 15 motor domain was then purified by anion exchange chromatography ( 5 / 50 MonoQ GL ; Cytiva ) . After injecting the sample , the column was washed with 10 mM MOPS , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 0 , then eluted with a linear gradient to 1M NaCl . Fractions eluting at ∼ 31 mS·cm −1 were concentrated ( 10 , 000 MWCO ) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography ( Superdex 200 , Cytiva ) with isocratic elution in 10 mM MOPS , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 1 mm NaN 3 , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM DTT , 1 μg·mL −1 , pH 7 . 0 . The myosin - 15 : ELC : RLC complex ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) eluted as a single peak , and was concentrated ( 10 , 000 .

Purity was confirmed by SDS - PAGE ( 4 – 20 % TGX , BioRad ) . Actin purification : Chicken skeletal muscle actin was purified as previously described ( MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ) and stored in G - Mg buffer : 2 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 at 4 °C . F - actin was prepared by mixing 5 μM monomeric actin with KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 ) supplemented with 0 . 01 % NP40 substitute ( Roche ) . The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to stimulate polymerization , followed by 4 °C overnight . Grid preparation : For the F - actin alone sample , 3 μl of F - actin diluted to 0 . 6 μM in KMEI + NP40 was applied to a glow discharged C - flat 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 holey carbon Au 300 mesh grid ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in a Leica GP plunge freezer operating at 25°C . After 60 s incubation , the grid was blotted from the back with Whatman no . 5 filter paper for 4 s and flash frozen in liquid ethane . To prepare the rigor wild - type and jordan mutant myosin - 15 bound F - actin samples , 10 U / ml apyrase was added to 6 μM myosin - 15 and incubated on ice for 20 minutes to remove nucleotide . 60 s after applying 3 μl of 0 . 6 μM F - actin to a glow discharged grid , 3 μl of myosin - 15 was added and incubated for 60 s . After that 3 μl of the mixture solution was removed and another 3 μl of myosin - 15 was applied . After an additional 60 s of incubation , 3 μl of the mixture solution was removed and the grid was blotted for 4 s and flash frozen in liquid ethane . The ADP - Mg state wild - type myosin - 15 bound F - actin specimen was prepared identically , except that wild - type myosin - 15 was incubated with 5 mM ADP - Mg for 20 minutes prior to grid preparation . Cryo - EM data collection : Data were collected on a FEI Titan Krios operating at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan K2 - summit detector using super - resolution mode . Exposures were targeted using stage translations with a single exposure per hole using the SerialEM software suite ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) , and movies were .

Each exposure was fractionated across 40 frames with a total electron dose of 60 e - / Å 2 ( 1 . 5 e - / Å 2 / frame ) and a total exposure time of 10 s , with defocus values ranging from - 1 . 5 to - 3 . 5 μm underfocus . Cryo - EM image processing : Image processing was carried out using the Iterative Helical Real Space Refinement ( IHRSR ) protocol as implemented in the RELION 3 . 0 pipeline ( Egelman , 2007 ; Zivanov et al . , 2018 ) . Unless otherwise noted , all steps were carried out in RELION . Movie stacks were motion corrected , dose weighted and summed with 2 x 2 binning ( to a 1 . 03 Å pixel size ) using the MotionCor2 algorithm ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) with 5 x 5 patches as implemented in RELION . Contrast Transfer Function ( CTF ) estimation was performed with CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . Filaments were auto - picked and split into overlapping segments with a step size of 81 Å , corresponding to 3 actin protomers , then extracted in a box size of 512 pixels and subjected to two - dimensional ( 2D ) classification . Segments contributing to featureful class - averages were selected and subjected to three - dimensional ( 3D ) classification with 4 classes , initialized with helical parameters of 27 Å rise and - 166 . 7° twist . The cryo - EM maps of F actin alone ( EMD - 7115 ) and myosin VI bound F actin ( EMD - 7116 ) were low pass filtered to 35 Å to serve as the initial models for F actin alone and myosin - 15 decorated F actin datasets , respectively . The best 3D class from each dataset was selected and low - pass filtered to 35 Å to serve as the initial reference for subsequent 3D auto - refinement . Segments contributing to all the 3D classes , which did not substantially vary in features , were included for 3D auto - refinement . After 3D auto - refinement , post - processing was performed for each dataset using a 3D mask with a Z length of 50 % of the box size , resulting in maps with 4 . 23 Å ( actin alone ) , 4 . 23 Å ( rigor wild - type myosin - 15 ) , 6 . 16 Å ( rigor jordan myosin - 15 ) , and 5 . 56 Å ( ADP wild - type myosin - 15 ) resolution based on the Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) 0 . 143 criterion . To further improve the resolution , iterative CTF refinement , Bayesian polishing and 3D auto - refinement was carried out by adapting a recently described procedure ( Mei et al . , 2020 ) .

Subsequent post - processing was performed using a 3D mask with a Z length of 30 % of the box size , then a second round of CTF refinement with beam - tilt estimation , Bayesian polishing and 3D auto - refinement using the converged map from the previous refinement low - pass filtered to 35 Å as the initial reference . A final masked refinement was performed for the rigor wild - type reconstruction using the 30 % Z length mask , which modestly improved the resolution : masked refinement did not improve either of the other actomyosin reconstructions . Final post - processing for each dataset was performed with a 30 % Z length mask , leading to final resolution assessments of 2 . 82 Å ( F - actin alone ) , 2 . 83 Å ( rigor wild - type myosin - 15 ) , 3 . 76 Å ( rigor jordan mutant myosin - 15 ) , and 3 . 63 Å ( ADP wild - type myosin - 15 ) by the FSC 0 . 143 criterion ( Figure S1 ) . Local resolution estimation and filtering was performed using RELION 3 . 0 . Data acquisition and processing details are listed in Table S1 . Model building and structure refinement : For F - actin alone , a published actin model ( PDB : 6BNO ) ( Gurel et al . , 2017 ) was docked into the EM density by rigid body fitting in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) and manually adjusted in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) . In this starting model , the D - loop was modeled in the “Out” conformation . For the actomyosin structures , an initial homology model of myosin - 15 was generated with I - TASSER ( Zhang , 2008 ) using the crystal structure of myosin V ( PDB : 1OE9 ) ( Coureux et al . , 2003 ) as the template . The myosin - 15 model and the F - actin alone model were then docked into each cryo - EM density map to generate actomyosin starting models . Models were then subjected to Rosetta density - guided model rebuilding ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ) . For each initial model , 200 models were generated , and the top 10 lowest energy models were manually inspected in Coot . Non - overlapping stretches of amino acids that fit the cryo - EM density best were selected from these individual models then stitched together to build the full model . For F - actin alone and rigor wild - type actomyosin - 15 , the D - loop of a subset of the 10 lowest - energy models adopted the “In” conformation , which were subsequently used to model this conformer for these states .

The stitched full models were refined using phenix . real _ space . refine in the Phenix software package ( Afonine et al . , 2018 ) , iterated with manual adjustment in Coot . Model validation was conducted with MolProbity ( Williams et al . , 2018 ) as implemented in Phenix . Molecular graphics and multiple sequence analysis : Figures and movies were generated with PyMol ( The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 2 . 3 . 4 ; Schrödinger , LLC ) , UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , and ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) . Multiple sequence alignment was performed with Clustal Omega ( Madeira et al . , 2019 ) and formatted with Jalview ( Waterhouse et al . , 2009 ) . Pyrene actin polymerization : Skeletal rabbit actin was purified and labeled on Cys 374 with N - ( 1 - pyrene ) - iodoacetamide ( Criddle et al . , 1985 ) . A correction factor was applied for determining pyrene actin concentration , A corr = A 290 – ( 0 . 127 * A 344 ) . Actin polymerization was measured in a cuvette - based fluorometer ( PTI Quantamaster 400 , HORIBA Scientific ) with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm . Gel filtered G - actin monomers ( 10 % pyrene labeled ) were desalted ( PD SpinTrap G - 25 , Cytiva ) into a modified G - buffer without ATP ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 , 1 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 ) , stored on ice and used within 3 hours . G - actin was converted to the Mg 2 + bound form by addition of 50 µM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA for two minutes at room temperature , before starting the polymerization reaction by mixing G - actin ( 3 x stock ) with KMEI buffer ( 1 . 5x stock ) in a 1 : 2 ratio , respectively . Wild - type myosin - 15 and ADP were included in the 1 . 5 x KMEI buffer , as needed . Final reaction conditions were 2 µM G - actin , 1 µM myosin - 15 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 at 25 ± 0 . 1 ºC . Data were corrected for the reaction dead - time . Single - filament actin polymerization : Skeletal rabbit actin was purified , labeled on Cys 374 using tetramethylrhodamine - 5 - maleimide ( Adipogen Life Sciences ) , and its concentration measured using A corr = A 290 – ( 0 . 208 * A 550 ) ( Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) .

G - actin stocks were prepared with TMR - actin ( 20 % ) and biotin - actin ( 10 % ) doping , and desalted into a modified ATP - free G - buffer as described above . Cover glass ( 24 × 50 mm , # 1 . 5 , Marienfeld Superior , Germany ) were sequentially sonicated in 2 % Hellmanex III ( Hellma , Germany ) , 1 M KOH , 100 % ethanol , and finally Milli - Q water , prior to drying under a nitrogen stream and processing under argon plasma ( ZEPTO , Diener Electronic , Germany ) . Cleaned cover glass were coated with mPEG - silane ( 2 mg / mL , Laysan Bio , AL ) and biotin – PEG – silane ( 2 μg∙mL - 1 , Laysan Bio ) diluted in 96 % ethanol , 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) HCl , and baked at 70 °C for 1 hour . Cover slips were rinsed in 96 % ethanol , sonicated , followed by rinsing and sonication in Milli - Q water , and finally dried under a filtered nitrogen stream . Flow chambers were assembled using double - sided sticky tape to create a channel on a glass slide . Flow cells were washed with T50 buffer ( 10 mM Tris∙HCl , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 ) , and incubated with 0 . 1 mg / mL neutravidin ( Thermo Scientific ) in T50 for 1 minute , then washed in 1 mg / mL bovine serum albumin ( A0281 , Sigma Aldrich ) in T50 for 30 s , followed by a final wash of T50 . Experiments were performed in the following buffer : 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole , 10 mM DTT , 15 mM glucose , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 20 μg∙mL - 1 catalase , 100 μg∙mL - 1 glucose oxidase , pH 7 . 0 at 21 ± 1 °C . Purified myosin - 15 motor domain ( 1 µM ) and ADP were included as needed . The reaction flow cell was imaged using an inverted microscope ( Nikon Ti - E2 ) equipped with an oil immersion objective ( CFI Apochromat TIRF 100x , 1 . 49 N . A . , Nikon ) for objective - style total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( H - TIRF , Nikon ) . TMR fluorescence was excited using 561 nm , and emission filtered ( ET630 / 75m , Chroma ) . Images were captured on an EM - CCD camera ( iXon Ultra 888 , Andor ) controlled by NIS - Elements ( AR version 5 . 2 , Nikon ) . Data were corrected for the assay dead - time . Images were background subtracted and registered ( descriptor - based series registration , 2d / 3d + t ) in FIJI ( https : / / fiji . sc ) . Actin filament densities were quantified using the Analyze Particle command ( size > 3 pixel 2 , circularity : 0 . 0 - 1 . 0 ) to count particles within a 50 x 50 μm region of interest ( ROI ) that was randomly selected from the image .
