RGCs have an elongated bipolar morphology with basal and apical endfeet which reside in distinct niches . 18 Yet , how this subcellular compartmentalization of RGCs controls cortical development is largely unknown . Here , 19 we employ in vivo proximity labeling using unfused BirA to generate the first subcellular proteome of RGCs and 20 uncover new principles governing local control of cortical development . We discover a cohort of proteins that are 21 significantly enriched in RGC basal endfeet , with MYH9 and MYH10 among the most abundant . Myh9 and Myh10 22 transcripts also localize to endfeet with distinct temporal dynamics . Although they each encode isoforms of non - 23 muscle myosin II heavy chain , Myh9 and Myh10 have drastically different requirements for RGC integrity . Myh9 24 loss from RGCs decreases branching complexity and causes endfoot protrusion through the basement 25 membrane . In contrast , Myh10 controls endfoot adhesion , as mutants have unattached apical and basal endfeet . 26 Finally , we show that Myh9 - and Myh10 - mediated regulation of RGC complexity and endfoot position non - cell 27 autonomously controls interneuron number and organization in the marginal zone . Our study demonstrates the 28 utility of in vivo proximity labeling for dissecting local control of complex systems , and reveals new mechanisms 29 for dictating RGC integrity and cortical architecture . 30 31 3 Introduction 32 Radial Glial Cells ( RGCs ) play a vital role in cortical development by regulating the production and 33 organization of diverse cell types , including neurons and glia [ 1 , 2 ] . These functions are influenced by the RGC 34 bipolar morphology . RGCs extend a long basal process to the pia ; this elongated structure can be several 35 hundred microns long in mice and centimeters long in humans . The basal process ends in subcellular 36 compartments , called basal endfeet that attach to the basement membrane ( BM ) ( Fig 1A ) . RGCs also maintain 37 connections to the ventricle through apical endfeet with their cell body positioned in the ventricular zone ( VZ ) . 38 The radially oriented basal processes serve as scaffolds to guide newborn neurons as they migrate from their 39 birth location in the VZ to the cortical plate ( CP ) . As development progresses , RGCs become morphologically 40 more complex , with increased endfoot number and branching at the distal end of the basal process [ 3 - 5 ] . 41 Importantly , basal endfeet are conserved structures , found not just in RGCs , but also in other essential neural 42 progenitors of the cortex , including outer or basal radial glia ( oRG / bRG ) [ 6 - 9 ] . Thus , understanding these 43 subcellular structures can give valuable insights into cortical development . 44 45 Fig 1 - In vivo proximity labeling reveals proteins enriched in radial glia basal endfeet compared to the 46 whole cell 47 ( A ) Cartoon representation of RGC morphology ( green ) and basement membrane ( black ) , and pial niche 48 composed of : interneurons and Cajal Retzius cells ( grey ) , blood vessels ( red ) , and fibroblasts ( brown ) .

They form a 63 physical barrier at the pia , preventing over migration of neurons [ 8 , 10 , 11 ] . Consistent with this , detachment of 64 basal endfeet from the pia can cause neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by ectopic neurons such as 65 Cobblestone Lissencephaly Type II [ 10 - 13 ] . Basal endfeet are embedded in a local niche composed of 66 interneurons and Cajal - Retzius cells ( CR cells ) in the marginal zone ( MZ ) and blood vessels and fibroblasts 67 ( meninges ) above the BM [ 14 - 16 ] . Extrinsic cues from this basal niche , including retinoic acid and fibroblast 68 growth factors , can influence RGC proliferation [ 17 , 18 ] . Hence from their physical position basal endfeet may 69 play a role in signaling and organizing surrounding cells of the niche [ 19 , 20 ] . The basal process and endfeet are 70 also preferentially inherited by daughter progenitors , suggesting they may influence cell fate [ 8 , 21 - 23 ] . However , 71 how these basal structures are controlled and influence critical features of cortical development is largely 72 unknown . 73 Emerging data suggest that gene expression within RGCs can be controlled at the subcellular level . A 74 number of mRNAs have been shown to localize to basal endfeet including Ccnd2 , and 115 transcripts bound by 75 the RNA binding protein FMRP [ 24 - 27 ] . Previous work from our lab has established the active trafficking of 76 mRNAs from the cell body to basal endfeet , where transcripts are competent to undergo local translation [ 27 ] . 77 Despite this , few endfoot localized proteins have been identified and functionally interrogated . Dystroglycan is 78 localized to basal endfeet at the protein level and is required for maintenance of the BM and prevention of 79 neuronal over migration [ 11 ] . Analysis of another localized gene , Arhgap11a , revealed roles for locally produced 80 ARHGAP11A in endfoot morphology [ 28 ] . These studies suggest the importance of subcellular control for cortical 81 development . Yet , beyond just a few examples , the local proteome of RGC endfeet has never been 82 characterized . 83 5 In this study , we leverage in vivo proximity labeling to determine the subcellular proteome of RGC basal 84 endfeet . Using mouse genetics , we interrogate the subcellular function of two highly enriched protein coding 85 isoforms of non - muscle myosin heavy chain II ( NMHC II ) . We demonstrate that these isoforms have 86 complementary and distinct requirements in maintaining the structural integrity of RGCs during development . 87 Dysregulation of this morphology causes non - cell autonomous alterations in cellular composition and 88 organization of the MZ . Collectively , our data illustrate a diverse repertoire of proteins which may influence 89 cortical development via local functions . Furthermore , we show how cells of the nervous system utilize distinct 90 protein isoforms to coordinate control of unique subcellular functions . 91 92 Results 93 BioID labels radial glial proteins in vivo in an unbiased fashion 94 Previously , a thorough biochemical characterization of radial glial endfeet had been intractable due to an 95 inability to efficiently and specifically isolate protein from this small ( < 10  m ) subcellular compartment . We 96 developed a method to circumvent this limitation by combining two techniques : endfoot microdissection [ 27 ] and 97 proximity - labeling proteomics . Endfoot microdissection allows for mechanical separation of basal endfeet from 98 the rest of the RGC by peeling the outer layer , which includes BM , meninges , and basal endfeet , from the 99 embryonic brain [ 27 ] . However , this approach alone cannot be used to distinguish endfoot - specific proteins from 100 those of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and the meninges . Therefore , we turned to proximity labeling to tag 101 proteins in RGCs . We chose to use BioID proximity - labeling due to its suitability for in vivo applications [ 29 , 30 ] . 102 The BirA * enzyme releases reactive biotin intermediates which biotinylate lysine residues on neighboring 103 proteins making it ideal for promiscuous biotinylation [ 31 , 32 ] . Canonically , BirA * can be fused to a protein - of - 104 interest to characterize an interactome . However , we conceived a new use of this system . We predicted that , 105 upon in utero electroporation ( IUE ) into the developing brain , unfused BirA * would freely diffuse through the 106 cytoplasm to broadly label proteins within RGCs including in endfeet . This would allow us to classify RGC 107 proteins which are enriched in BirA * ( BioID + ) cells compared to non - electroporated controls ( BioID - ) ( Fig 1B ) . 108 6 We first verified that cytoplasmic BirA * specifically biotinylates proteins within electroporated RGCs 109 including endfeet . We electroporated cytoplasmic BirA * under control of the CAG promoter into embryonic day 110 ( E ) 14 . 5 embryonic cortex , where it would be preferentially expressed in progenitors of the VZ . Importantly , 111 samples were harvested within 1 day of electroporation to minimize expression of BirA * in RGC progeny . 112 Exogenous biotin was administered by consecutive intraperitoneal injections of 10 mM biotin into the pregnant 113 dams at E13 . 5 , E14 . 5 ( at the time of electroporation ) , and E15 . 5 ( shortly before dissection ) ( Fig 1C ) . Brains were 114 harvested at E15 . 5 and immunofluorescence was used to detect the BirA * enzyme with anti - HA as well as 115 biotinylated proteins with fluorescently - conjugated streptavidin . The biotin signal was robust and restricted to the 116 electroporated hemisphere , evident in RGC cell bodies and endfeet ( Fig 1D ) . Similarly , HA tagged BirA * also 117 localized throughout the entire RGC . Importantly , the biotin signal was restricted to cells expressing the BirA * 118 enzyme , demonstrating that biotinylation only took place in the presence of BirA * and ensuring the cellular 119 specificity of this method . 120 Next , we verified that BirA * electroporated brains would enrich for biotinylated proteins , relative to 121 endogenously biotinylated proteins from non - electroporated brains . Using the experimental approach described 122 above , we collected samples from both BioID + and BioID - brains for affinity purification ( Fig 1E ) . In contrast to 123 BioID - brains , the BioID + brains contained many additional silver - stained bands ( S1A Fig ) . We confirmed the 124 biotinylation of these proteins by western blot with HRP - conjugated streptavidin ( Fig 1F ) . Among these was a 125 strong band at approximately 35 kDa corresponding to BirA * , which self biotinylates , as well as 2 endogenously 126 labeled proteins that correspond to endogenously biotinylated carboxylases [ 33 , 34 ] . These results demonstrate 127 that electroporation of BirA * results in robust protein biotinylation that is readily distinguishable from that of the 128 negative control . 129 To ensure that BirA * would label proteins with diverse subcellular localizations and molecular functions 130 in an unbiased fashion , we performed qualitative tandem mass spectrometry on proteins affinity purified from 131 BioID + and BioID - cortices . In total , 1 , 453 unique proteins were identified . Of these , 961 were BioID + specific , 132 110 were BioID - specific , and 382 were shared ( S1B Fig ) . In the BioID + sample we detected proteins from 133 diverse functional categories including cytoskeleton , RNA binding and proteostasis , vesicles and cell signaling , 134 mitochondria and metabolism , and nuclear structures and DNA binding ( S1C Fig ) . As expected , RGC - specific 135 7 factors , including the intermediate filament protein NES and the adhesion molecule NCAM1 , were detected . This 136 qualitative pilot experiment ensured that unfused BirA * would label functionally distinct classes of proteins across 137 the cytoplasm . 138 139 Discovery of an RGC basal endfoot enriched proteome 140 We next used quantitative proteomics to discover subcellularly localized proteins in RGCs . To purify 141 biotinylated endfoot proteins , we used microdissection to remove the endfeet and surrounding meningeal tissue 142 from electroporated brains ( Fig 1G ) . We pooled these endfoot preparations from multiple cortices for each 143 biological replicate for both electroporated ( BioID + ) and non - electroporated ( BioID - ) samples . To determine 144 which proteins were specifically enriched in endfeet relative to the rest of the cytoplasm , we also collected non - 145 microdissected ( whole RGC ) BioID + and BioID - cortices ( Fig 1H ) . For each condition ( endfeet BioID + , endfeet 146 BioID - , whole RGC BioID + , and whole RGC BioID - ) , three biological replicates were processed and affinity 147 purified simultaneously before performing quantitative tandem mass - spectrometry analysis . The quantitative 148 proteomics analysis revealed 1 , 532 unique proteins across all samples ( S1 - 3 Tables ) . To identify proteins 149 specific to RGCs , we filtered for proteins that were at least 1 . 5 - fold enriched in the BioID + condition relative to 150 BioID - condition for both the endfoot and whole RGC samples ( Fig 1I ) . This yielded 137 proteins from the endfoot 151 samples and 245 from the whole RGCs ( S4 and S5 Tables ) . To assess the reliability of these candidates , we 152 evaluated several endfoot proteins by IF and smiFISH ( S2 Fig ) . We validated PSME1 and PSEM2 , which had p 153 values of 0 . 28 and 0 . 21 respectively ( S2G and S2H Figs ) . Therefore , we further filtered the endfeet BioID + 154 candidates for those with a p value ≤0 . 28 . This revealed 103 proteins present in endfeet but not necessarily 155 subcellularly enriched ( S6 Table ) . Next , we selected for proteins that were enriched in basal endfeet relative to 156 the entire cytoplasm by filtering for those that were > 1 . 2 - fold higher in the BioID + endfoot samples relative to 157 the BioID + RGC samples . As a result of this filtering , we discovered 47 proteins that are abundant and clearly 158 enriched in endfeet relative to both the negative control and whole RGC ( Fig 1I , Table 1 , S7 Table ) . 159 160 Table 1 : Endfoot enriched proteome uncovered by BioID 161 8 Protein ID ProteinTeller Probability Fold Change ( Endfeet + / RGC + ) Fold Change ( Endfeet + / Endfeet - ) t - test ( Endfeet + / Endfeet - ) Protein Class MYH9 1 43 . 67 3 . 49 0 . 085 Myosin CMPK2 0 . 91 34 . 91 13 . 07 0 . 009 Mitochondria KIAA1107 0 . 86 28 . 93 3 . 92 0 . 074 Unknown ISG15 1 24 . 94 37 . 80 0 . 000 Ubiquitin LAMC1 1 23 . 23 1 . 57 0 . 116 ECM MYH10 1 20 . 78 2 . 95 0 . 110 Myosin LCP1 1 18 . 68 4 . 04 0 . 004 Actomyosin FGA 1 15 . 61 6 . 10 0 . 001 ECM CORO1A 1 14 . 50 5 . 54 0 . 001 Actomyosin FN1 1 13 . 31 6 . 20 0 . 001 ECM MYL6 1 13 . 01 2 . 19 0 . 086 Myosin COL6A1 1 12 . 88 2 . 12 0 . 005 ECM POSTN 1 12 . 43 4 . 41 0 . 034 ECM COL4A2 1 12 . 24 15 . 05 0 . 005 ECM TGM2 1 12 . 22 8 . 71 0 . 009 Protein Crosslinking H2 - K1 0 . 97 12 . 05 18 . 71 0 . 001 Signaling HSPG2 1 10 . 84 3 . 25 0 . 000 ECM BST2 1 9 . 39 8 . 09 0 . 051 Signaling TGFBI 1 8 . 90 14 . 10 0 . 013 Signaling TLN2 1 8 . 16 1 . 51 0 . 021 Actin FGG 1 7 . 77 4 . 06 0 . 004 ECM MYH14 0 . 87 7 . 45 3 . 39 0 . 070 Myosin COL5A1 0 . 99 6 . 86 12 . 62 0 . 026 ECM 9 COL4A1 0 . 86 6 . 40 9 . 20 0 . 004 ECM COL2A1 1 6 . 18 7 . 10 0 . 042 ECM COL1A1 1 6 . 09 7 . 69 0 . 017 ECM TNS3 0 . 99 5 . 78 5 . 32 0 . 000 Actin Focal Adhesion COL3A1 1 5 . 56 8 . 45 0 . 005 ECM COL1A2 1 5 . 39 8 . 82 0 . 009 ECM PSME2 1 5 . 36 2 . 17 0 . 214 Ubiquitin VPS29 0 . 97 4 . 11 1 . 66 0 . 174 Vacuolar LAMB2 0 . 99 3 . 90 1 . 51 0 . 045 ECM PSME1 1 3 . 48 1 . 67 0 . 283 Ubiquitin FBN2 0 . 99 3 . 42 7 . 31 0 . 011 ECM CNDP2 1 2 . 52 1 . 84 0 . 065 Signaling Mapk GGA1 1 2 . 47 2 . 67 0 . 159 Ubiquitin FGB 1 2 . 13 1 . 64 0 . 053 ECM KIF15 0 . 91 1 . 89 2 . 58 0 . 016 Microtubule EDC4 1 1 . 62 2 . 06 0 . 013 RBP SAMHD1 1 1 . 48 2 . 10 0 . 005 GTPase RBBP9 0 . 87 1 . 46 2 . 76 0 . 013 Hydrolase RNF213 1 1 . 34 5 . 04 0 . 002 Ubiquitin CEP295 0 . 97 1 . 30 3 . 57 0 . 099 Microtubule ACAD9 1 1 . 27 1 . 71 0 . 241 Mitochondria PSA7L 0 . 99 1 . 26 1 . 52 0 . 265 Ubiquitin DCTN1 1 1 . 24 4 . 27 0 . 000 Microtubule FERMT3 0 . 99 N / A 2 . 50 0 . 002 Integrin 162 10 Using STRING analysis , we investigated protein interaction networks of the endfoot enriched 163 proteins ( Fig 2A ) [ 35 ] . The endfoot proteome contained nodes related to actin and microtubule 164 cytoskeletal regulation , ubiquitin pathway , mitochondria function , and RNA metabolism . It also 165 contained a large interaction node of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins , including many collagens , 166 laminins , and fibrinogens . Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis reinforced these endfoot enriched categories 167 with ECM structural constituent , actin - dependent ATPase activity , and cell adhesion molecule binding 168 among the most enriched molecular functions ( Fig 2B ) . We validated several endfoot - enriched 169 proteins , including TNS3 and ISG15 , by co - immunofluorescence with EGFP - labelled RGC endfeet 170 ( S2B - G Figs ) . Notably , the mRNA encoding TNS3 was previously detected in the FMRP - bound 171 transcriptome in endfeet [ 27 ] . Moreover , If5 , Map1b , and Kif21a , also FMRP targets in endfeet , were 172 detected in the endfoot proteome , although not specifically enriched compared to the whole RGC . We 173 also validated additional endfoot - enriched proteins at the mRNA level by single - molecule inexpensive 174 fluorescent in situ hybridization ( smiFISH ) including Psme1 , Col4a1 , and Myl6 ( S2H - J Figs ) . This 175 suggests that at least a subset of endfoot enriched proteins may be locally translated . 176 177 Fig 2 - The endfoot proteome is enriched for ECM and cytoskeletal regulators , including non - muscle 178 myosin IIA and B . 179 ( A ) STRING analysis of the 47 endfoot enriched proteins .

Scale bar ( I , J ) : 5µm . n = 3 191 brains , 3 sections per brain ( I , J ) . 192 193 To interrogate the molecular similarity between endfeet and other subcellular structures in the nervous 194 system , we compared our proteome to a previously published synapse proteome ( Fig 2C ) [ 36 ] . 21 proteins were 195 shared between the two datasets , accounting for 44 . 7 % of the endfoot proteome including myosins , collagens , 196 and proteasome subunits . Even more overlap was observed between our subcellular proteome and two 197 independent synapse transcriptomes ( Fig 2D ) [ 36 , 37 ] . This intersection suggests that there may be a cohort of 198 conserved genes required for maintenance of distal , subcellular structures [ 38 , 39 ] . Furthermore , the non - 199 overlapping genes may provide insights into RGC specific components and functions . 200 Through these experiments , we have characterized the first subcellular proteome of RGC endfeet . We 201 identified both intracellular and extracellular proteins , some of which are candidates for local translation in 202 endfeet . These enriched proteins comprise functionally related categories which may provide further insights 203 into subcellular structures and functions of RGCs . 204 205 Non - muscle myosin II heavy chain isoforms are highly enriched in basal 206 endfeet 207 Non - muscle myosin heavy chain II ( NMHC II ) isoforms were among the most enriched proteins from the 208 endfoot proteome ( Figs 2E , F ) . Non - muscle myosin II ( NM II ) is a heteromeric complex composed of two heavy 209 chains , two regulatory light chains , and two essential light chains ( Fig 2G ) . The most highly enriched protein was 210 NMHC IIA ( MYH9 ) , encoded by Myh9 . MYH9 was enriched 43 . 7 in endfeet relative to the whole RGC . Mice and 211 humans have two additional heavy chain isoforms , NMHC IIB ( MYH10 ) and NMHC IIC ( MYH14 ) , encoded by 212 Myh10 and Myh14 , respectively . These isoforms were also highly enriched in endfeet with 20 . 8 - fold enrichment 213 for MYH10 and 7 . 5 - fold enrichment MYH14 ( Figs 2E - G ) . These heavy chain components are highly conserved 214 12 between mice and humans with 97 % , 99 % and 91 % amino acid homology for MYH9 , MYH10 , and MYH14 , 215 respectively . NM II light chain 6 ( MYL6 ) was also found in the endfoot proteome ( Table 1 , Figs 2A , E , F ) . 216 Localization of MYH9 , MYH10 , and MYH14 to endfeet in E15 . 5 brains was validated by immunofluorescence 217 ( MYH9 and 10 ) and with a MYH14 - GFP knock - in mouse [ 40 ] ( Figs 2H - J and S2A and S2B Figs ) . 218 In endfeet , MYH9 and MYH10 showed high protein levels and were some of the most enriched 219 candidates suggesting they may be particularly important in RGCs . We focus our analysis on these isoforms 220 because , in comparison , MYH14 had lower expression and less enrichment in endfeet ( Fig 2E , F and S2A and 221 S2B Figs ) . As part of the NM II hexamer , MYH9 and MYH10 are essential for actin cross - linking and contraction , 222 and implicated in cellular protrusions , cell migration , mitosis , and adhesion [ 41 , 42 ] . The enrichment of non - 223 muscle myosins in basal endfeet suggest they could locally control these cellular processes in RGCs . Previous 224 studies have shown Myh10 is essential for neural development , with Myh10 null or mutant mice presenting with 225 severe hydrocephalus , disrupted neuroepithelial adhesion , and disorganized neuronal migration [ 43 - 45 ] . While 226 NMHC II proteins have been implicated in cortical development [ 43 - 45 ] , their precise requirements in RGCs are 227 unknown . 228 229 Myh9 and Myh10 transcripts localize to basal endfeet with distinct 230 temporal dynamics 231 The proteomic screen and subsequent validation indicate that endfeet are significantly enriched for 232 NMHC II proteins , and particularly show high levels of MYH9 and MYH10 . Previous data indicate that endfeet 233 contain local transcriptomes and are capable of subcellular translation [ 24 , 27 ] . We therefore examined the 234 subcellular localization of Myh9 and Myh10 transcripts using smiFISH within EGFP - labeled endfeet . At E15 . 5 235 both Myh9 and Myh10 were localized within endfeet ( Figs 3A , B ) . To define the timing of this localization , we 236 characterized the localization of Myh9 and Myh10 across different stages of cortical development , from E12 . 5 to 237 E16 . 5 . Both transcripts were expressed at all stages as evidenced by smiFISH puncta in the cell bodies ( Figs 238 3C , E , G ) . However , surprisingly , the subcellular distribution of Myh9 and Myh10 in RGC endfeet was distinct over 239 the course of development . Myh9 mRNA was most enriched in endfeet at E12 . 5 and declined at E13 . 5 and 240 13 E14 . 5 , showing only sparse levels at E15 . 5 and E16 . 5 ( Figs 3C , D ) . In contrast , endfoot localized Myh10 showed 241 relatively low localization at early developmental stages ( E12 . 5 ) with gradual increases until the last stage 242 examined ( E16 . 5 ) ( Figs 3C , F ) . We did not observe corresponding changes in Myh9 and Myh10 mRNA 243 distribution in the cell body across development suggesting these changes are not driven solely by expression 244 differences ( Figs 3E , G ) . Our data suggest the intriguing possibility that Myh9 and 10 could have unique and 245 complementary roles in endfeet over the course of development . The observation that both mRNAs and proteins 246 localize to endfeet supports the possibility that they may be locally produced and have local functions . It further 247 proposes a role for isoform switching in endfeet , such that one isoform of non - muscle myosin II may be required 248 in endfeet early in development and then may be replaced by the other key isoform . 249 250 Fig 3 - Myh9 and Myh10 mRNAs localize to endfeet in complementary patterns that change across 251 development 252 ( A , B ) Co - localization of Myh9 smiFISH ( white , A ) or Myh10 smiFISH ( white , B ) with electroporated endfeet 253 ( green ) at E15 . 5 .

To test this , we crossed Myh9 lox / lox and Emx1 Cre / + ; 270 Myh9 lox / + mice to produce control ( Ctrl ) , cHet , and cKO littermates with Myh9 specifically removed from RGCs 271 and their progeny [ 47 , 48 ] ( S3A and S3B Figs ) . First , we injected carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) , 272 a dye which covalently labels intracellular molecules [ 49 ] , into the ventricles of E16 . 5 embryos ( Fig 4A ) . The 273 direct delivery of CFSE to the ventricle targeted its uptake to RGCs and allowed us to quickly label their 274 morphology including the basal process and basal endfeet [ 50 ] . We then collected the brains 2 hours later . In 275 the Ctrl and cHet brains , the basal processes were straight and radially oriented and the endfeet formed a single , 276 un - interrupted line at the pia ( Fig 4B ) . In contrast , there were obvious gaps between individual Myh9 cKO endfeet 277 with many extended past their normal stopping point and into the pia ( Fig 4B ) . These results indicate that Myh9 278 mutants have defects in RGC endfeet . 279 280 Fig 4 - Myh9 regulates basal endfoot complexity and organization relative to the basement membrane 281 ( A ) Cartoon schematic of ( Top ) mating scheme used to generate embryos and ( Bottom ) method for CFSE 282 labeling of RGC morphology .

At the same stage , E16 . 5 , there was no significant difference in the density of RGCs 302 ( SOX2 + ) nor in the number of apoptotic cells ( CC3 + ) ( Figs 4C , F and S3C ) . Additionally , the organization of 303 progenitors was normal , as shown by equivalent measurements of the SOX2 + cell layer thickness ( Fig 4E ) . 304 Furthermore , cortical thickness was similar across genotypes , further supporting the lack of a neurogenesis 305 defect ( Fig 4D ) . This indicates that Myh9 is not required in RGCs for their number , survival , and organization , 306 suggesting the impaired morphology is not due to cell body defects . 307 By E16 . 5 , RGCs have complex basal structures including extensive branching and multiple endfeet [ 4 , 308 28 ] . To examine the requirement of Myh9 for basal morphology at higher resolution , RGCs were sparsely labelled 309 using IUE of membrane bound EGFP ( pGLAST - EGFP CAAX ) at E15 . 5 . We examined E16 . 5 brains and made 310 3D reconstructions of individual cells , focusing on branching in the MZ ( Fig 4G ) . As an endfoot phenotype was 311 not observed in the CFSE - labeled cHet brains ( Fig 4B ) , we focused our in - depth analysis on the cKOs . First , we 312 quantified the total number of branches for each RGC and found that the cKO RGCs have significantly fewer 313 branches compared to their Ctrl counterparts ( Figs 4H , I ) . Next , we assessed the complexity of the branches 314 present by assigning 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th , 5 th , or 6 th branch order to each based on the number of ramifications between 315 the basal process and the branch of interest ( Figs 4H , J ) . The branches of Myh9 cKO RGCs were less complex 316 than those of Ctrl with significantly fewer 2 nd and 3 rd order branches ( Fig 4J ) . Additionally , Myh9 cKO RGCs had 317 fewer endfeet per cell ( Fig 4K ) . Altogether , these data reveal an essential requirement of Myh9 for RGC 318 complexity and endfoot number . 319 16 Next , we assessed the organization of RGC basal endfeet relative to the BM . For this we categorized 320 each endfoot as attached ( connected to the BM ) , unattached ( below the BM , but not touching it ) , or protruded 321 ( through the BM into the pia ) ( Figs 4L and S3D Fig ) . Ctrl and cKO RGCs showed similar percentages of 322 unattached endfeet , with 17 % and 15 % , respectively ( Fig 4L ) . However , there was a significant striking 323 difference in endfoot attachment , with 76 % of Ctrl endfeet attached and only 42 % of cKO . 8 % of Ctrl endfeet 324 protruded compared to 43 % of cKO endfeet . This suggests that endfeet which fail to attach properly are instead 325 protruding through the BM . Taken together with the CFSE labeling ( Fig 4B ) , these data indicate that Myh9 is 326 required for proper endfoot organization and morphology . Considering the 43 - fold enrichment of MYH9 protein 327 ( Figs 2E , F ) , localized mRNA ( Figs 3A , D ) , and the lack of cell body defects ( Figs 4C - F ) , our results are 328 consistent with a subcellular role for MYH9 in RGC complexity and endfoot organization . 329 330 Myh10 is required to maintain RGC basal and apical 331 endfeet attachments 332 In addition to MYH9 ( NMHC IIA ) , MYH10 ( NMHC IIB ) is also significantly and abundantly enriched in 333 endfeet . We therefore sought to investigate the specificity and necessity of this additional NMHC II isoform , 334 MYH10 , in endfeet . Following conditional removal of Myh10 from RGCs and their progeny with Emx1 - Cre ( S4A 335 Fig ) we labeled RGCs with in utero injections of CFSE to visualize morphology [ 48 , 51 ] ( Fig 5A ) . At E16 . 5 , we 336 observed a profound loss of endfeet at the BM in the Myh10 cKO cortices , compared to Ctrl or cHets ( Fig 5B ) . 337 In these brains , the basal processes lost their radially oriented organization ( Fig 5C ) . We then assessed earlier 338 developmental stages to understand if endfeet are initially attached to the pia and then detach . At E14 . 5 many 339 endfeet were organized at the pia , compared to E16 . 5 ( Fig 5D ) . By E15 . 5 , progressively more endfeet became 340 unattached from the BM ( Fig 5E ) . This indicates that while Myh10 is not initially required for endfeet attachment 341 at the BM , it is necessary to maintain their adhesion as development progresses . Notably , this phenotype was 342 drastically different than that of Myh9 cKO brains . 343 344 Fig 5 - Myh10 is required for attachment of both basal and apical endfeet 345 17 ( A ) Cartoon schematic of ( Left ) mating scheme used to generate embryos , ( Center ) method for CFSE labeling 346 of RGC morphology , and ( Right ) purple boxes representing regions in B and C .

Scale bar : ( B , C , I ) 50µm ; ( D , E ) , 10µm ; ( F ) 100µm ; ( J , L ) 25µm . 364 365 366 As Emx1 - Cre depletes Myh10 from RGC cell bodies as well as endfeet , we interrogated the requirement 367 of Myh10 for progenitor survival and neurogenesis . At E16 . 5 there was no significant difference in the density of 368 SOX2 + RGCs in the cortex ( Figs 5F , H ) . Widespread cell death was also not observed ( S4B Fig ) . Additionally , 369 cortical thickness was similar between Ctrl , cHet , and cKO brains ( Fig 5G ) . Altogether , this suggests that , similar 370 to Myh9 , Myh10 is not essential for neurogenesis at these stages . Furthermore , it indicates the reduction of basal 371 endfeet at the BM is not a result of RGC cell death or decreased RGC number . 372 18 While the number of SOX2 + progenitors was unaffected , their organization was disrupted , with fewer 373 cells in the VZ and more located basally throughout the cortical plate ( Fig 5F ) . The proliferative capacity of these 374 disorganized progenitors was maintained as shown by the distribution of KI67 + cells throughout the cortex ( S4C 375 Fig ) . To understand the cause of this mispositioning we examined earlier stages of development . The SOX2 + 376 RGCs were initially properly organized at E13 . 5 , however , as development progressed , they became 377 increasingly disorganized and displaced from the ventricle ( Fig 5I ) . 378 RGCs are anchored to the ventricle by an apical endfoot ( Fig 1A ) [ 52 , 53 ] . Indeed , basal displacement 379 of progenitors is also seen in mutants where apical endfeet are impaired [ 54 , 55 ] . Therefore , we hypothesized 380 that MYH10 may influence apical endfeet attachment to mediate RGC localization in the VZ . To test this , we first 381 examined MYH10 expression at the ventricle . This revealed that , in addition to basal endfoot localization , MYH10 382 is also strongly localized at the apical border across development ( E13 . 5 - E16 . 5 ) ( Fig 5J ) . This apical signal was 383 abolished in Myh10 cKO brains ( S4A Fig ) . We then used en face imaging of the cortices to assess apical endfoot 384 morphology with phalloidin to mark F - actin and β - catenin to mark cell - cell adhesions ( Fig 5K ) . We did this 385 analysis at E14 . 5 , a stage when some RGCs were still in the VZ and others were basally positioned ( Fig 5I ) . 386 Both F - actin and β - catenin showed clear disorganization of the apical endfeet in the cKO brains while the cHets 387 were indistinguishable from Ctrl ( Figs 5L and S4D Fig ) . These results suggest that MYH10 localization at apical 388 endfeet enables RGCs to remain attached to the ventricle , and indicates that loss of Myh10 impairs actin 389 organization . 390 391 The gradual loss of basal endfeet from the BM and apical endfeet from the ventricular border 392 demonstrates that MYH10 is essential for the attachment of both basal and apical endfeet . The divergent 393 phenotypes of Myh9 and Myh10 cKO RGCs highlight the unique functions of each NMMHC II isoform in endfeet 394 and cortical development . 395 396 RGC integrity impacts interneuron number and organization in the MZ 397 Our data show that MYH10 is essential for RGC basal endfeet attachment to the BM . We thus sought to 398 understand whether this endfoot phenotype impacted surrounding cells , with a goal of gaining new insights into 399 19 functions of RGC endfeet . In E16 . 5 Myh10 cKO brains almost all basal endfeet were detached from the BM and 400 absent from their niche in the marginal zone ( MZ ) [ 56 ] . We thus examined the general architecture of the MZ 401 which is populated by CR cells and interneurons ( Fig 6A ) . First , we used DAPI staining to label all nuclei ( Fig 402 6B ) . We discovered 33 % more DAPI + cells in the MZ of Myh10 cKO brains compared to Ctrl ( Fig 6C ) . However , 403 the thickness of the MZ was unchanged indicating the influx of additional cells caused an overall higher cell 404 density ( Fig 6D ) . To assess the identity of these cells , we stained brains for calretinin , which labels both CR 405 cells and interneurons at this stage [ 57 - 59 ] . We quantified a 2 . 4 fold increase in the thickness of the calretinin 406 layer in the Myh10 cKO brains , suggesting that cells within this region may either be disorganized and / or 407 increased in number ( Fig 6E , F ) . To determine if this defect preceded the endfoot phenotype , we assessed both 408 Calretinin and Reelin at E13 . 5 . Neither were impaired at this earlier stage , supporting the idea that endfeet 409 defects underlie altered MZ composition ( S5B and S5C Figs ) . To further identify the fate of these cells , we 410 quantified P73 , a marker for many CR cell subtypes [ 60 - 64 ] . Notably P73 + cells were not increased in the MZ of 411 Myh10 cKO brains ( Figs 6G , H ) . Likewise , there was also no difference in the thickness of the Reelin layer , which 412 is expressed by CR cells at this stage [ 65 ] ( S5A Fig ) . Together with the P73 data , this suggests that CR cell 413 number is intact in the absence of endfeet in Myh10 cKO brains . We then stained for interneurons using LHX6 414 ( Fig 7A ) . This revealed the identity of the DAPI + surplus cells to be interneurons with 43 % more in the MZ of 415 Myh10 cKO brains ( Figs 7A , B ) . As Emx1 - Cre is not active in these interneurons , this indicates that Myh10 416 controls interneuron organization in the MZ by acting non - cell autonomously in RGCs . These data further show 417 that RGC endfoot attachment is essential for maintaining proper number of interneurons in the developing cortex . 418 419 Fig 6 - Detached endfeet , caused by loss of Myh10 , impact cortical architecture 420 ( A ) Cartoon schematic of an RGC ( green ) and the local niche where the endfeet reside made up of BM ( black ) , 421 fibroblasts ( brown ) , vasculature ( red ) , CR cells ( grey ) and interneurons ( red ) .

Scale bar : ( A , C ) 50µm ; ( E , G ) 25µm . 448 449 Our data show that MYH9 controls unique aspects of RGC morphology and endfoot position , compared 450 to MYH10 , which promotes RGC endfoot adhesion to the BM . Given these complementary phenotypes , this 451 presented an opportunity to discover how endfeet influence interneurons . Myh10 cKO brains had 40 % more 452 LHX6 + cells in the MZ relative to ctrl ( Fig 7A , B ) . In contrast , there was no significant difference in the total 453 21 number of LHX6 + cells in the MZ between Ctrl and Myh9 cKO brains ( Figs 7C , D ) . This suggests that in the 454 absence of endfeet ( Myh10 cKO ) , more interneurons flood into the open space of the MZ . In comparison , 455 reduced complexity of RGCs ( Myh9 cKO ) does not affect interneuron number in the MZ . 456 In addition to their high density in the MZ , some interneurons are in tight contact with the BM . Myh9 457 deficient RGC endfeet have altered position and complexity relative to the BM . We therefore tested the possibility 458 that these defects would instead influence interneuron position . To measure this , calculated the fraction of all 459 LHX6 + cells in the MZ that were touching the BM . In Ctrl brains , a subset of LHX6 + interneurons in the MZ 460 directly contact the BM ( marked by laminin ) [ 66 ] . In contrast , in Myh9 cKO brains there was a significant reduction 461 in the fraction of LHX6 + cells touching the BM ( Figs 7E , F ) . Similarly , the Myh10 cKO mice , where endfeet were 462 completely missing from the MZ , showed a significant reduction in the fraction of LHX6 + cells contacting the BM 463 ( Figs 7G , H ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that endfeet are essential for both interneuron number 464 and organization in the MZ . This reveals distinct roles for Myh9 and Myh10 in shaping the pial niche of the 465 developing cortex ( Fig 8A ) . 466 467 Fig 8 - Endfoot enriched proteome highlights MYH9 and MYH10 which control RGC integrity and 468 interneurons 469 Cartoon summary illustrating the local proteome of RGC basal endfeet . The middle and right cartoons depict the 470 impact of Myh9 and Myh10 on RGC ( green ) morphology and the organization of CR cells ( grey ) and interneurons 471 ( red ) . 472 473 Discussion 474 Subcellular control is fundamental for functions of diverse cells and tissues , including those of the nervous 475 system . A key question is how subcellular specificity is conveyed . By employing in vivo proximity labeling , we 476 have discovered a local proteome of RGC basal endfeet , opening up a new understanding of this subcellular 477 structure . To demonstrate the power of these data , we functionally interrogated MYH9 and MYH10 . Surprisingly , 478 22 these two NMHC II isoforms exhibit contrasting and complementary functions in modulating RGC complexity 479 and endfoot position over the course of development . We further show that RGC morphology and adhesion to 480 the BM non - cell autonomously directs interneuron number and position at the pia . Taken together , our study 481 illustrates how two protein coding isoforms are differentially utilized spatially and temporally in RGCs to help 482 instruct cortical architecture . 483 484 In vivo proximity labeling uncovers first subcellular proteome of radial 485 glia 486 Basal endfeet are evolutionarily conserved structures across progenitors , yet their composition and 487 function has been largely enigmatic . Biological characterization of endfeet is technically challenging due to the 488 inability to purify this tiny subcellular compartment . By combining in vivo proximity labeling of RGCs with 489 mechanical dissection of the pia , we circumvented this limitation and produced an unbiased subcellular proteome 490 of radial glia . We discovered that endfeet are enriched for components of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and 491 ubiquitin - proteasome pathway , and cytoskeletal regulators . This screen thus nominates new candidates which 492 may influence cortical development via localized control of RGCs . 493 494 Why are proteins subcellularly enriched in RGC basal endfeet ? One answer lies in the complex , 495 elongated morphology of RGCs which can extend several hundred microns in mice to centimeters in humans . 496 This cellular architecture confers unique functions to apical and basal RGC structures . While the cell body 497 controls gene expression and cell division , the basal processes and endfeet are critical for orchestrating 498 migration of excitatory neurons from the VZ to the CP . Furthermore , as the cortex expands over the course of 499 development , RGCs elongate their basal process and endfeet become more complex [ 4 ] . Thus , signaling and 500 cytoskeletal components could be uniquely important for the acute remodeling and maintenance of these basal 501 structures , as illustrated by our study of myosins . Endfoot enriched proteins may be especially important in 502 gyrencephalic species such as ferrets or in primates where RGC morphology is highly complex and the basal 503 process extremely long [ 15 , 67 ] . Additionally , basal endfeet are conserved structures found in oRGs , a 504 23 predominant neurogenic precursor of primates implicated in human brain development [ 6 , 7 ] . Thus , in future 505 studies , it will be interesting and important to define the composition of basal endfoot proteomes of RGCs and 506 oRGs across species . 507 Endfoot enrichment of proteins may be achieved by at least two main mechanisms . The mRNA encoding 508 a specific protein may be trafficked to basal endfeet where it undergoes local translation , as we have previously 509 shown can occur [ 27 ] . In support of this mechanism , we demonstrated mRNA localization for several proteins 510 from our screen . This includes transcripts that were not previously identified [ 27 ] , such as Myh9 and Myh10 . 511 Further , a subset of this endfoot proteome is encoded by known FMRP - bound transcripts in endfeet [ 27 ] . The 512 endfoot proteins that were not identified in this FMRP interactome may be encoded by transcripts bound by other 513 RNA binding proteins . However , a second possible mechanism is that these proteins may be translated in the 514 cell body and then trafficked to basal endfeet . We posit that both mechanisms are at play to control RGC basal 515 structures . 516 517 Extracellular Matrix and ubiquitin components are enriched in basal 518 endfeet 519 Using a cytoplasmic BirA * we were surprised to discover ECM , including laminins , fibrillar collagens , and 520 integrin interactors , as the largest category of enriched proteins in basal endfeet . Of note , ECM proteins are 521 subcellularly represented at the mRNA and protein level in neuronal synapses [ 36 , 37 ] . Thus , across elongated 522 cell types , local production of ECM components may be conserved [ 68 ] . We speculate that RGC basal endfeet 523 may serve as hubs for local production and secretion of ECM components . Reciprocally , ECM may provide a 524 physical and signaling niche to influence RGC endfeet , scaffold structure , or neurogenesis [ 12 , 69 ] . For example , 525 germline knockout of Col3a1 , which encodes an endfoot enriched protein , impairs RGC morphology and causes 526 neuronal heterotopias [ 70 ] . Future studies will be valuable for understanding how RGCs contribute to ECM 527 production and function as well as the interplay within this niche . This question is relevant for human biology as 528 ECM is instrumental for human cortical development . Indeed , ECM transcripts are especially elevated in 529 24 developing human cortices compared to mice [ 71 , 72 ] . Furthermore , ECM is thought to help maintain the 530 proliferative capacity of oRGs and influence cortical folding [ 7 , 73 - 75 ] . 531 Ubiquitin and proteasome components including E3 ubiquitin - ligase RNF13 and proteasome subunits 532 PSME1 , PSME2 , and PSMA7 , were also enriched in endfeet . This suggests that beyond local translation , 533 endfeet may be competent for ubiquitin - mediated degradation of subcellular proteins . We speculate local 534 degradation could fine - tune protein levels including those which necessitate temporal restriction such as 535 signaling factors . Beyond tagging proteins for degradation , ubiquitination can also promote protein trafficking , 536 endocytosis , and cell division [ 76 ] . These additional roles may be important for endfoot maintenance and 537 function . 538 539 Non - muscle myosin isoforms control diverse aspects of RGC 540 morphology 541 We demonstrate that local function of cytoskeletal regulators is essential for dynamic remodeling of RGC 542 basal structures throughout cortical development . This is reflected by a focused analysis of Myh9 and Myh10 , 543 and also hinted at by the presence of additional cytoskeletal regulators in the local proteome . 544 Myh9 was especially important for RGC endfoot morphology and position . NM II can negatively regulate 545 cellular protrusion by modulating actin retrograde flow and pausing [ 77 - 79 ] . In fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and 546 monocytes , NM IIA inhibition results in failure to retract processes [ 80 , 81 ] . Likewise , MYH9 may control basal 547 endfoot protrusion via similar mechanisms . The mechanical force provided by NM II may also be used for 548 formation and remodeling of ECM , including collagen and fibronectin [ 82 - 86 ] . Although we did not observe an 549 overt defect in ECM in Myh9 or Myh10 mutants , altered ECM remodeling and / or production could contribute to 550 aberrant protrusion of RGC basal endfeet through the BM . 551 In contrast to Myh9 , we show that Myh10 is necessary for maintaining attachment of both basal and 552 apical endfeet . While Myh10 cKO endfeet were initially associated with the BM , this attachment is progressively 553 lost over development indicating an adhesion defect . Adhesion proteins , including tensin and talin , are enriched 554 in endfeet and integrin is required for the attachment of RGC endfeet to the BM [ 12 , 13 , 87 ] . Thus , MYH10 could 555 25 influence endfoot attachment by modulating these proteins . In this regard , mechanical force generated by NM II 556 can reverse steric inhibition of key adhesion components , including talin and integrin [ 88 - 90 ] . NM II can also 557 cluster vinculins , talins , and integrins at the cell membrane by bundling actin filaments [ 91 ] . Additionally , NM II 558 can promote nascent adhesion maturation and maintenance by attaching to adhesion - associated actin bundles 559 [ 77 , 92 , 93 ] . Furthermore , NM II may influence endfoot attachment to the BM by remodeling ECM [ 82 - 86 ] . Taken 560 together , this suggests several potential mechanisms by which MYH10 may promote endfoot adhesion . 561 562 Surprisingly , Myh9 and Myh10 conditional knockout mice had strikingly different RGC endfoot 563 phenotypes . Our findings beg the question : how do these two protein isoforms mediate diverse roles in RGCs ? 564 One explanation is they are functionally interchangeable and that distinct phenotypes are explained by their 565 subcellular localization rather than isoform - specific capabilities . In support of this possibility , in other contexts , 566 some Myh9 or Myh10 specific phenotypes are explained by spatial or temporal expression differences rather 567 than unique functions [ 94 , 95 ] . The smiFISH analysis of Myh9 and Myh10 across development revealed that 568 the NMHC II isoforms have complementary temporal localization patterns . Thus , the unique phenotypes may be 569 driven by developmental timing when each isoform is enriched in endfeet . MYH9 and MYH10 share 77 % 570 sequence homology at the protein level , suggesting they could , in fact , be interchangeable . Indeed , in the cell 571 body of RGCs , we observe clear compensation by these isoforms . NMHC II A and B are each essential for 572 cytokinesis , however , we did not observe proliferation defects in Myh9 or Myh10 cKO mice [ 96 - 98 ] . 573 Alternatively , the differential functions of NMHC II proteins in endfeet could also be conveyed by isoform 574 specific properties . NMHC II isoforms do not heterodimerize and each has unique kinetic properties [ 42 , 99 ] . NM 575 IIA generates quick actin contractions and can move filaments at least 3x faster than NM IIB [ 100 - 102 ] . NM IIB 576 can bear higher mechanical loads than NMIIA , as it uses less energy to maintain long - term tension [ 101 , 103 , 577 104 ] . These kinetic properties may be advantageous for distinct regulation of branching and adhesion by Myh9 578 and Myh10 respectively . Furthermore , MYH9 and MYH10 have differential phosphorylation sites in their coiled - 579 coil and tail domains which may regulate their activity and ability to form filaments [ 105 - 109 ] . In sum , our data 580 indicate that isoform switching , both temporally and subcellularly , can fine tune molecular responses within 581 endfeet . 582 26 583 RGC morphology and endfoot position regulate cortical composition 584 and organization 585 Our study provides evidence for new functions of RGC endfeet in cortical development . Previous genetic 586 models of endfoot perturbation suggest their involvement in BM maintenance and prevention of neuronal over 587 migration [ 10 , 11 , 13 ] . We did not observe such phenotypes in Myh9 and Myh10 conditional knockout models , 588 Here , we discover critical yet specific functions for endfeet in controlling proper number of interneurons in the 589 MZ . Loss of Myh10 led to 40 % more interneurons in the MZ compared to Ctrl , but did not affect transiently 590 migratory CR cells . This makes sense given that CR cells migrate very early into the MZ around E12 . 5 and are 591 dynamic . Hence a perturbation after that stage could be compensated for by reintroduction of new CR cells [ 65 ] . 592 We further show that reduced endfoot complexity or absence of endfeet reduces interneurons in contact with 593 BM . Both Myh9 and Myh10 mutants affected the fraction of LHX6 + cells in contact with the BM , consistent with 594 other findings from our group [ 28 ] . 595 How do endfeet control interneuron number and organization ? Endfeet may provide both chemical and 596 physical cues to influence interneurons . Interneuron migration is regulated by extracellular signals such as 597 CXCL12 from the meninges [ 110 ] . Endfeet could also be a source of attractive or repulsive signals . Thus , in the 598 absence of endfeet in Myh10 cKOs , such cues may be missing resulting in excess interneuron number in the 599 MZ . Additionally , as interneurons migrate tangentially through the MZ , they come in close contact with RGC 600 basal structures [ 16 , 111 ] . Therefore , these transitory neurons may use endfeet to both establish proper position 601 and number in the MZ . In Myh10 cKOs , where endfeet are absent , we show that interneurons fill this “empty 602 space . ” Thus , our data suggest that endfeet are necessary to limit the number of cortical interneurons within this 603 future synaptic zone . In comparison , in Myh9 cKOs , where RGC endfeet are present but disorganized , we posit 604 that interneurons may not receive proper chemical or physical cues to attach to the BM . In future studies it will 605 be interesting to consider the longer - term consequences of these interneuron positioning defects . Mutations in 606 NMHC II proteins are also linked to neurological disease and thus it will be interesting to further understand the 607 human relevance of these endfoot and interneuron defects [ 112 , 113 ] . 608 27 This work furthers our understanding of local gene regulation in RGCs by discovering the first subcellular 609 proteome of RGCs and uncovering endfoot enriched proteins . Our study further argues for the importance of 610 studying subcellular proteomes in understanding cell biology . While BirA * fusion proteins have been used for 611 discovery of synaptic proteomes [ 114 ] , we implement a new use of untagged BirA * to discover unbiased 612 cytoplasmic proteomes in vivo . Hence , beyond cortical development , this approach for subcellular proteomics 613 may be valuable in other cell types , such as neurons and glia . In sum , our study illustrates how discovery of 614 subcellular proteomes can give unique insights into cellular and tissue - level processes . 615 616 Acknowledgements 617 The authors thank past and present members of the Silver lab for discussions and careful reading of this 618 manuscript .

The following mouse lines were used : Myh9 lox / lox [ 47 ] ( Gift , Robert Adelstein ) , Myh10 lox / lox 625 [ 51 ] ( Gift , Robert Adelstein ) , Emx1 - Cre ( 005628 ) [ 48 ] ( Jackson Laboratory ) , Nestin - EGFP [ 46 ] ( Gift , Qiang Lu ) , 626 Myh14 - GFP [ 40 ] ( Gift , Terry Lechler ) . Proteomics and validation were performed on wild type C57BL / 6J mice 627 ( Jackson Laboratory ) . Background : Myh9 lox / lox and Myh10 lox / lox mixed C57BL / 6J ; SV129 , Emx1 - Cre and Nestin - 628 EGFP C57BL / 6J . Embryonic stage E0 . 5 defined as the morning the plug was identified . 629 630 28 Statistical Methods and Rigor 631 Description of specific n , statistical tests , and p values for each experiment are reported in the Fig legends . For 632 all experiments , male and female mice were used and littermates were compared when possible . All analyses 633 were performed by 1 or more investigators blinded to genotype and / or condition . 634 635 In utero biotinylation 636 The pcDNA3 . 1 - MCS - BirA ( R118G ) - HA construct ( gift , Scott Soderling ) was subcloned into the pCAG - Ex2 vector . 637 DNA for experiments was prepared using either the GenElute HP Endotoxin - Free Maxi Prep Kit ( Sigma , 638 NA0410 ) or the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit ( Qiagen , 12362 ) . For in utero electroporations , pregnant dams were 639 kept under anesthesia with an isoflurane vaporizer . After making an incision in the abdomen , uterine horns were 640 exposed . One μl of the plasmid solution was injected into the lateral ventricles of the embryonic brains using a 641 micropipette . Subsequently , brains were electroporated using five pulses at 40 - 60V for 50 ms at 950 - ms intervals 642 with platinum - plated BTX Tweezertrodes . The plasmid mixture consisting of pCAG - Ex2 - BirA - HA at 1 . 0 μg / μL , 643 pCAG - EGFP at 1 . 0 μg / μL , and FastGreen FCF Dye ( Sigma , 861154 ) in PBS was injected into C57BL / 6J 644 embryos at E14 . 5 . Embryos were dissected approximately 30 hours later at E15 . 5 . Embryos were exposed to 645 exogenous biotin by IP injection of the dam 3 times with 10 mM biotin / PBS pH 7 . 5 at E13 . 4 , E14 . 5 ( at the time 646 of IUE ) , and E15 . 5 ( shortly before dissection ) . Electroporated brains were harvested in cold , sterile PBS . The 647 electroporated regions were microdissected using a fluorescent microscope to visualize the GFP signal , and 648 endfeet were isolated by mechanically separating the meninges from the cortex , as previously [ 27 ] . For the whole 649 cortex sample , non - peeled brains containing the meninges and endfeet were used . For the no BirA samples , 650 non - electroporated littermate embryos were used . Tissues were stored at - 80°C until all samples had been 651 collected . 652 653 Affinity Purification 654 29 Samples were lysed in 0 . 5 mL of homemade RIPA lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM 655 NaCl , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % SDS , and 1 mM EDTA supplemented with Halt Protease 656 Inhibitor Cocktail ( Thermo Scientific , 78430 ) on ice for 10 minutes . They were then homogenized with an electric 657 homogenizer on ice for two 15 second pulses separated by a 30 second rest . 250 units of benzonase nuclease 658 ( Sigma Aldrich , E8263 ) were added and incubated on ice for 60 minutes to reduce lysate viscosity . Samples 659 were sonicated on ice at 30 % amplitude for two pulses of 15 seconds separated by a 60 second rest . The lysate 660 was cleared by centrifugation at 21 , 000 rcf for 60 minutes at 4°C . Cleared lysate was transferred to a tube with 661 50ul NeutrAvidin Agarose beads ( Thermo Scientific , 29200 ) in RIPA buffer . These tubes were incubated 662 overnight on a rotator at 4°C . After the overnight incubation , the flow - through was removed and beads 663 proceeded with a series of 8 - minute washes . The beads were washed twice with wash buffer 1 ( 2 % SDS ) , once 664 with wash buffer 2 ( 1 % deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 ) , 665 once with wash buffer 3 ( 250 mM LiCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , 1 mM EDTA , and 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 1 ) , 666 and twice with wash buffer 4 ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 and 50 mM NaCl ) . Finally , the beads were boiled with 50 μL of 667 Laemmli sample buffer , 50 mM DTT , and 40 mM biotin to elute the purified biotinylated proteins . The first 668 quantitative mass - spec analysis failed to detect many proteins because of deficiencies with the streptavidin 669 beads . The purification was repeated with fresh beads and the flow through from the first purification that had 670 been stored at - 80 before resubmitting for a successful second round of mass spec . The qualitative proteomics 671 experiment was performed on 8 pooled cortices ( whole cortex ) from 2 electroporation litters for each condition 672 ( n = 1 technical replicate ) . For the quantitative proteomics experiment , endfoot preps were pooled from 66 - 68 673 cortices for each technical replicate ( n = 3 ) and non - microdissected cortices from 6 embryos were pooled for each 674 technical replicate ( n = 3 ) . The samples were derived from a total of 51 electroporated litters . 675 676 Western Blot and Silver Stain 677 6 microdissected cortices were used for both BirA + and BirA - conditions in the protein gel analysis . The affinity 678 purified sample was split such that 60 % ( ~ 3 . 6 cortices ) was used for silver stain analysis and 20 % ( ~ 1 . 2 cortices ) 679 for western blot analysis . 4 - 20 % Mini - PROTEAN TGX polyacrylamide gels ( Bio - Rad , 4568094 ) were used . Silver 680 30 staining was performed with the Pierce Silver Stain Kit ( Thermo Scientific , 24612 ) according to manufacturer’s 681 instructions . For western blotting , the electrophoresed gel was transferred to Trans - Blot TURBO PVDF 682 membranes ( Bio - Rad , 1704157 ) , blocked in 1 % BSA / TBST for 1 hour at room temperature , and incubated with 683 HRP - conjugated streptavidin ( Thermo Scientific , SNN1004 , 1 : 10 , 000 ) in 1 % BSA / TBST for 1 hour at room 684 temperature . The was blot 3 times with TBST and developed with Pierce ECL Substrate ( Thermo Scientific , 685 32106 ) in a Gel Doc XR + ( Bio - Rad , 1708195 ) . 686 687 Quantitative Proteomics 688 50μL of each sample was loaded onto an Invitrogen NuPAGE 4 - 12 % SDSPAGE gel and run for approximately 689 5 minutes to electrophorese all proteins into the gel matrix . The entire molecular weight range was then excised 690 in a single gel - band and subjected to standardized in - gel reduction , alkylation , and tryptic digestion . Following 691 lyophilization of the extracted peptide mixtures , samples were resuspended in 12 μL of 2 % acetonitrile / 1 % TFA 692 supplemented with 12 . 5 fmol / μL yeast ADH . From each sample , 3 μL was removed to create a QC Pool sample 693 which was run periodically throughout the acquisition period . Quantitative LC / MS / MS was performed on 4 μL of 694 each sample , using a nanoAcquity UPLC system ( Waters Corp ) coupled to a Thermo QExactive HF high 695 resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometer ( Thermo ) via a nanoelectrospray ionization source . Briefly , 696 the sample was first trapped on a Symmetry C18 20 mm × 180 μm trapping column ( 5 μl / min at 99 . 9 / 0 . 1 v / v 697 water / acetonitrile ) , after which the analytical separation was performed using a 1 . 8 μm Acquity HSS T3 C18 75 698 μm × 250 mm column ( Waters Corp . ) with a 90 - min linear gradient of 5 to 40 % acetonitrile with 0 . 1 % formic acid 699 at a flow rate of 400 nanoliters / minute ( nL / min ) with a column temperature of 55°C . Data collection on the 700 QExactive HF mass spectrometer was performed in a data - dependent acquisition ( DDA ) mode of acquisition 701 with a r = 120 , 000 ( @ m / z 200 ) full MS scan from m / z 375 – 1600 with a target AGC value of 3e6 ions followed 702 by 12 MS / MS scans at r = 30 , 000 ( @ m / z 200 ) at a target AGC value of 5e4 ions and 45 ms . A 20s dynamic 703 exclusion was employed to increase depth of coverage . The total analysis cycle time for each sample injection 704 was approximately 2 hours . 705 706 31 Proteomic bioinformatic analysis 707 Following 16 total UPLC - MS / MS analyses ( excluding conditioning runs but including 4 replicate QC injections ) , 708 data was imported into Rosetta Elucidator v 4 . 0 ( Rosetta Biosoftware , Inc . ) , and analyses were aligned based 709 on the accurate mass and retention time of detected ions ( “features” ) using PeakTeller algorithm in Elucidator . 710 Relative peptide abundance was calculated based on area - under - the - curve ( AUC ) of the selected ion 711 chromatograms of the aligned features across all runs . The MS / MS data was searched against a custom 712 Swissprot database with Mus musculus taxonomy ( downloaded in April 2017 ) with additional proteins , including 713 yeast ADH1 , bovine serum albumin , and E . coli BirA , as well as an equal number of reversed - sequence “decoys” 714 for false discovery rate determination . Mascot Distiller and Mascot Server ( v 2 . 5 , Matrix Sciences ) were utilized 715 to produce fragment ion spectra and to perform the database searches . Database search parameters included 716 fixed modification on Cys ( carbamidomethyl ) and variable modifications on Asn and Gln ( deamidation ) . After 717 individual peptide scoring using the PeptideProphet algorithm in Elucidator , the data was annotated at a 1 . 1 % 718 peptide false discovery rate . GO analysis was performed using the Database for Annotation , Visualization and 719 Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) [ 115 , 116 ] . Molecular Function ( MF ) direct results were reported for categories 720 with p≤0 . 05 . STRING analysis was performed using version 11 . 5 . Network constructed with medium confidence 721 option . Network edges represent confidence with line thickness equal to the strength of data support [ 35 ] . 722 723 Immunofluorescence 724 In utero BioID brains were fixed prior to microdissection for immunofluorescence analysis . Briefly , embryonic 725 brains were fixed overnight in 4 % formaldehyde / PBS , rinsed with PBS , incubated in 30 % sucrose / PBS overnight , 726 and then embedded in NEG - 50 ( Thermo Scientific , 6052 ) . 20 μm sections were used for all staining unless 727 otherwise specified . For antibody staining , sections were thawed , rinsed in PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 25 % Triton 728 X - 100 / PBS , blocked with 5 % NGS / PBS , incubated with primary antibody in block buffer overnight at 4°C or room 729 temperature for 2 hours , rinsed 3 times with PBS , incubated with species specific secondary antibody ( Alexa - 730 Fluor conjugated , Thermo 1 : 500 ) and DAPI in block buffer for 30 minutes or 2 hours at room temperature ( LHX6 731 and p73 ) , rinsed 3 times with PBS , and mounted with Vectashield Anti - Fade Mounting Medium ( Vector Labs , H - 732 32 1000 ) .

Briefly , 24 equimolar probes were hybridized to flap 744 sequences conjugated to Cy3 ( IDT ) . Brain sections were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % triton in DEPC PBS for 30 745 minutes , washed twice with smiFISH wash buffer and incubated with the hybridized probes overnight at 37 746 degrees . Myh9 , Myh10 , Col4a1 , and Myl6 probes were used at a dilution of 1 : 50 in smiFISH hybridization buffer . 747 Ccnd2 and Psme1 probes were used 1 : 200 . The following day , samples were washed twice in smiFISH wash 748 buffer , incubated with 1 : 1000 hoechst ( Thermo ) , washed with DEPC PBS and mounted with vectashield ( Vector 749 Labs ) . 750 751 CFSE labeling of RGC morphology 752 CFSE ( cell trace , Thermo ) was diluted to 20µM in DMSO then mixed with PBS and Fast Green Dye to a final 753 concentration of 2 . 5µM . Pregnant mice were anesthetized as described above in the IUE section . 2µl CFSE 754 solution was injected into the brains of embryonic mice ( E13 . 5 - E16 . 5 ) to fill both ventricles . Embryos were 755 returned to the abdomen and brains were collected 2 hours later . 756 757 En face imaging of apical endfeet 758 33 We microdissected the cortices of E14 . 5 brains and fixed them overnight in 4 % PFA . Stained floating in 24 well 759 plates . Permeabilized 0 . 3 % triton in PBS for 20 minutes , blocked in 5 % NGS in PBS , primary antibody diluted in 760 5 % NGS in PBS ( β - catenin 1 : 200 , ProteinTech , rhodamine - phalloidin 1 : 200 , Molecular Probes ) for 36 hours at 761 4°C . Secondary and hoechst in 5 % NGS in PBS ( Alexa Fluor goat anti - rabbit 488 1 : 400 , Thermo , hoechst 762 1 : 1000 , Thermo ) at 4°C overnight . Imaged with Andor Dragonfly Spinning Disk microscope with 63x oil 763 immersion objective . 764 765 Imaging and Analysis of neurogenesis 766 Myh10 en face apical endfoot images , Myh9 3D reconstructions , and Myh9 LHX6 / Laminin images were captured 767 using an Andor Dragonfly Spinning Disk Confocal plus with 40X and 63X objectives . All other images were 768 captured using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z . 1 with Apotome for optical sectioning . 20X , 40X , and 63X objectives 769 were used . For each experiment , 3 - 4 sections per embryo were imaged . Identical exposures , apotome phase 770 images , and Z intervals were used . Cell counting was performed manually ( FIJI cell counter ) or automatically 771 ( QuPath ) . For QuPath quantification , the following parameters were used : requested pixel size = 0 . 1µm , 772 background radius = 5µm , minimum area = 10µm 2 , maximum area = 200µm 2 , cell expansion = 2µm , include cell 773 nucleus and smooth boundaries were unselected . For quantification of cells touching the BM , cells colocalizing 774 with the BM label ( Laminin or Collagen ) were counted manually . Cortical , SOX2 , MZ , and Calretinin thickness 775 measurements were taken using the line tool in ImageJ . 776 777 Analysis of RGC basal process branching complexity and endfoot 778 position 779 RGC branching complexity was quantified as previously described [ 28 ] . Briefly , Ctrl and cKO RGCs were 780 sparsely labelled with pGLAST - EGFP - CAAX by IUE . 20 - 40 µ m Z - stack images , 0 . 25 µ m per step , were acquired 781 on an Andor Dragonfly Spinning Disk Confocal microscope at 63X . 3D projections were then generated for 782 assessment of endfoot number and position , and quantification of branches of each order per individual RGC in 783 34 ImageJ . We count branches > 5um . Round - shaped branch ends thicker than the processes were considered 784 endfeet and categorized as attached , unattached or protruded relative to the Laminin staining of the BM . 785 786 References 787 1 .
