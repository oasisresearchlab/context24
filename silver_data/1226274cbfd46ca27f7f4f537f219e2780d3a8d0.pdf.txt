In this study , ventilation rates are determined using tracer gas decay and pressure - based measurements for a full - scale ( 6m tall ) cube . The cube was either isolated ( 2 months of observations ) or sheltered within a staggered array ( 7 months ) , for both single - sided and cross ventilation ( openings 0 . 4m×1m ) . Wind speeds at cube height ranged between 0 . 04ms − 1 and 13 . 1ms − 1 . Errors for both ventilation methods are carefully assessed . There is no discernible linear relation between normalised ventilation rates from the two methods , except for cross ventilation in the array case . The ratio of tracer gas and pressure derived ventilation rates is assessed with wind direction . For single - sided ( leeward opening ) cases it approached 1 . For cross ventilation the ratio was closer to 1 but with more scatter . One explanation is that agreement is better when internal mixing is less jet - dominated , i . e . for oblique directions in the isolated case and for all directions for unsteady array ﬂ ows . Sheltering may reduce the ﬂ ushing rate of the tracer gas from the cube relative to internal mixing rate . This new dataset provides an extensive range of conditions for numerical model evaluation and for understanding uncertainty of ventilation rates . Knowledge of the latter is critical in building design . 1 . Introduction Accurate predictions of ventilation rates are required for the health and well - being of the occupants inside a building . Natural ventilation is suited to mild climates [ 47 ] to create a comfortable and healthy indoor environment , and save energy compared to mechanical ventilation systems [ 11 , 26 ] . A variety of tools are used to simulate natural venti - lation : EnergyPlus ( e . g . [ 54 ] ) , TRNSYS coupled with CONTAM ( e . g . [ 31 ] ) and CFD ( Computer Fluid Dynamics ) models ( e . g . [ 32 , 33 , 69 ] ) . To verify natural ventilation simulations , detailed datasets are required with temperature , internal gains , operable window position , tracer gas concentrations and air velocity observed [ 42 ] . Given natural ventila - tion ' s dependence on the external conditions , many studies use test chambers ( e . g . [ 58 , 69 ] ) or wind tunnel models ( e . g . [ 35 ] ) to control the boundary conditions , but lose the true information of the impact from varying atmospheric conditions . Full - scale measurements in true atmospheric conditions are limited , because of the variability of ex - ternal conditions , measurement di ﬃ culties and cost limitations [ 42 ] . Furthermore , determining natural ventilation rate in the urban en - vironment is more challenging due to the complex wind environment and all scales of turbulence encountered [ 1 ] . To date few full - scale studies of natural ventilation within an urban area have been undertaken , though most agree that natural ventilation becomes less e ﬀ ective in urban areas [ 13 , 14 , 63 ] . For isolated buildings , opening shape , size and location [ 45 , 56 , 65 ] could a ﬀ ect natural ven - tilation performance . Instantaneous ﬂ uctuations in wind direction and wind speed also have an e ﬀ ect [ 24 ] . To our best knowledge , the long - term measurement of natural ventilation for both isolated and array cases under the varying realistic atmospheric conditions , allowing the direct comparison of the two , has never been studied . In terms of methods for full - scale measurement of natural ventila - tion rate , both tracer gas techniques and pressure taps are the most https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . buildenv . 2018 . 03 . 055 Received 22 January 2018 ; Received in revised form 15 March 2018 ; Accepted 28 March 2018 ∗ Corresponding author .

Despite the study of ventilation becoming more multi - disciplinary , there is no clear guidance on which method to use and how methods compare for realistic buildings in actual meteor - ological conditions . Typically , average climate data are used , which by de ﬁ nition , missing both the extremes and the variability . Comparisons between pressure di ﬀ erence and tracer gas methods for naturally ventilated livestock buildings [ 10 , 52 ] found pressure dif - ference methods were unable to provide ‘ accurate ’ estimates or of true ventilation rate because of the dependence on wind speed . Un - fortunately , the inaccuracy was not quanti ﬁ ed . The objective of this paper is to compare tracer gas and pressure - based methods to determine ventilation rates in a full - scale ﬁ eld en - vironment ( both isolated and building array ) , with a detailed metho - dology and error analysis . The mean ventilation rates are determined with tracer gas decay ( Section 2 . 1 ) and pressure - based ( Section 2 . 2 ) methods for a ventilated 6 m high cube in an isolated and staggered cube array and with cross and single - sided ventilation . Mean ventila - tion rates are compared over a range of weather conditions and wind directions . 2 . Description of tracer gas and pressure - based methods 2 . 1 . Tracer gas decay method Determining ventilation rates through measurement of tracer gas concentrations is best suited to single zone systems or where sections of a building can be completely isolated [ 55 ] . The tracer gas methods commonly used are constant injection ( e . g . [ 66 ] ) , constant concentra - tion ( e . g . [ 4 ] ) and tracer gas decay ( e . g . [ 9 ] ) . Of the three , the decay method is more common , as smaller amounts of gas are required and it is easier to implement [ 44 ] . Despite carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) being naturally present in the atmo - sphere , it is commonly used as an indoor air quality indicator and as a tracer gas . Advantages includes its low cost and straightforward safety requirements . CO 2 can be released ( e . g . [ 9 , 16 ] ) or generated by room occupants ( e . g . [ 39 , 70 ] ) to be utilised [ 41 ] . Other gases used include sulphur hexa ﬂ uoride ( SF 6 ) [ 57 ] , sulphur dioxide ( SO 2 ) [ 18 ] , carbon monoxide ( CO ) [ 59 , 67 ] and nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2 ) [ 68 ] . Few guidelines for sensor positioning are available [ 21 ] [ 22 ] ; de - spite this being crucial to obtaining representative measurements [ 40 ] . Within mechanically ventilated rooms , inappropriate sensor positioning can cause tracer gas decay ventilation rate errors of up to 85 % [ 62 ] . Van Buggenhout et al . recommend siting at the ventilation outlet , while acknowledging wind speed , thermal e ﬀ ects and wind direction may make this impractical . This lack of guidance combined with other ex - perimental aspects can make comparison of results di ﬃ cult [ 40 ] . Basic comparisons require : measurement method , application details , in - strumentation and their calibrations , timings , number of measure - ments , meteorological conditions and building conditions [ 48 ] . found only half of [ 60 ] 26 studies gave instrumentation details and only 4 of the 26 provided measurement uncertainty values . Tracer gas ventilation rates stem from the mass - balance equation [ 36 ] : = − + V dC t dt C C t Q E ( ) ( ( ) ) i a i ( 1 ) where V ( m 3 ) is the room volume , Q ( m 3 s − 1 ) is the volumetric ﬂ ow rate , C i ( kg m − 3 ) is the indoor concentration of tracer gas , C a ( kg m − 3 ) is the external concentration of tracer gas , E ( kg s − 1 ) is the amount of tracer gas emitted from an indoor source and t ( s ) is time . C i Q is the transport of tracer gas from the room to the outside through openings or cracks and C a Q is the transport of tracer gas from the outside into the room . If no indoor source is present , then by integrating equation ( 1 ) the indoor concentration is : = − − + C t C C λt C ( ) ( ) exp ( ) i a a 0 ( 2 ) where C 0 is the concentration of gas when t = 0 and λ is the ventilation rate in air changes per hour ( h − 1 ) . To derive ventilation rate , taking the natural logarithm of equation ( 2 ) gives a linear relation with slope λ : − = − − C t C C C λ t ln ( ( ) ) ln ( ) i a a 0 ( 3 ) Ventilation rates ( Q , in m 3 s − 1 ) can be converted to λ ( h − 1 ) using : = λ 3600 Q V ( 4 ) Here all ventilation rates are in m 3 s − 1 unless otherwise stated . Equation ( 3 ) requires several assumptions [ 36 , 55 ] : (cid:129) The tracer gas is chemically inert , with the room objects neither absorbing nor releasing the tracer gas ; (cid:129) Room air is well - mixed ; i . e . , C i is spatially uniform ; (cid:129) Exchange of internal and external air occurs in places with direct contact with the outside ; e . g . windows ; (cid:129) Room is a single zone system . Di ﬀ erences in room temperature may lead to strati ﬁ cation , in - e ﬀ ective mixing and the presence of dead - zones within a room [ 62 ] . 2 . 2 . Pressure - based method Pressure di ﬀ erences across a building provide a second ventilation rate method . Either the internal - external or windward - leeward ex - ternal face ( e . g . [ 12 , 25 , 59 ] ) pressure di ﬀ erences may be used . An al - ternative to direct pressure measurement is to assume a pressure coe ﬃ cient can be estimated . However , the e ﬀ ects of urban surround - ings on pressure coe ﬃ cients ( e . g . [ 2 , 32 , 33 , 64 ] ) ; are not well known . Research to determine pressure coe ﬃ cients often focuses on parts of a building design , e . g . wind towers [ 28 ] . The review by [ 8 ] of pressure coe ﬃ cient data models highlighted that signi ﬁ cant variations in esti - mates occur between sources . Given the lack of pressure coe ﬃ cient data for low wind speeds ( < 4 m s − 1 ) , building ventilation rates for these conditions are rare . The relative role of thermal or wind driven processes poorly understood [ 8 ] . If a pressure di ﬀ erence ( Δ p ) between the internal and external en - vironments or between the front and back of a building can be deduced , the ﬂ ow rate through the opening ( Q p ) is : = Q C A Δp ρ 2 p d ( 5 ) where ρ is the air density . C d A is the e ﬀ ective area of an opening . This changes with the number of openings and their relative positions . C d is the discharge coe ﬃ cient and A is the opening area . The assumptions required for equation ( 5 ) are : (cid:129) ﬂ ow is turbulent under normal pressures , (cid:129) kinetic energy is dissipated at the windward opening (cid:129) presence of openings does not in ﬂ uence the surface pressure dis - tribution . For cross ventilation with both inlets and outlets , some of the tur - bulent kinetic energy can be preserved and directed outside without interior dissipation , undermining the kinetic energy assumption [ 30 , 43 ] . Suggested alternatives ( e . g . [ 23 , 30 , 53 ] ) have not replaced the ori ﬁ ce equation . The largest source of error arises from using a mean rather than instantaneous pressure di ﬀ erences [ 6 ] . Uncertainty increases with very large ( unde ﬁ ned ) openings [ 46 ] as non - uniform pressure di ﬀ erences occur and the ventilation opening velocity pro ﬁ les vary with time . Er - rors arise if an incorrect discharge coe ﬃ cient is used , as C d is sensitive to opening size and wind direction and also for cross ventilation , the ratio of the two openings [ 5 , 29 ] . H .

Experimental design Observations were undertaken within the REFRESH ( Remodelling Building Design Sustainability from a Human Centred Approach ) Cube Campaign ( RCC ) . Full details of the array set - up , external and internal ﬂ ow patterns and an overview of the data gathered within RCC - REFRESH are given in [ 16 , 17 , 32 , 33 ] . Details pertaining to the de - termination of ventilation rates are given here . Observations ( Table 1 ) were taken at Wrest Park , Silsoe , Bed - fordshire , U . K . ( 52 . 01088° N , − 0 . 410979° W ) using an uninhabited instrumented cube ( height 6 m ) . The cube , was clad in ﬂ at , steel sheets to ensure uniform external surfaces . It was positioned to be perpendi - cular to the prevailing site wind direction ( Fig . 1 ) . Observations oc - curred in two phases , with the instrumented cube : ( i ) surrounded by a limited staggered array of eight cubes ( October 2014 – April 2015 ) and ( ii ) isolated ( May – July 2015 ) . Therefore , radiative di ﬀ erences occur between the array ( winter – spring ) and isolated ( early summer ) cases . These are accounted for as far as possible within the analysis . The real - world environmental factors are used to characterise the measure - ments . The cube ' s front and back faces had removable panels ( 0 . 4 m wide x 1 m high ) allowing both a sealed and a ventilated structure . Both single - sided and cross ventilated set - ups were used with the centre point of the opening 3 . 5 m above from the ground ( Fig . 1a ) . This is smaller than the 1 m 2 openings used by [ 59 ] as they found the ventilation rates were too large ( gas ﬂ ushed < 30 s ) to accurately measure the tracer gas decay curves and meteorological conditions . 3 . 1 . Temperature measurements Temperature measurements inside the cube ( Table 1 ) allowed de - termination of thermal strati ﬁ cation , and with the external tempera - tures on the Channel mast ( Fig . 1 , Table 1 ) the thermally - driven ven - tilation component . The Vaisala WXT520 weather station was positioned to minimise solar gains . Internal temperatures measured at 24 points ( Fig . 2 , Table 2 ) were sampled at 10 Hz to allow the average over a large number of samples in the 30 min value and a reasonably accurate mean . Eight thermocouples ( H1 to H8 ) were horizontally strung between the windows at a height of 3 m ( Table 2b ) . The other 16 were in four vertical pro ﬁ les of four thermocouples ( T1 to T4 ) , put at varying heights ( Table 2a ) below 4 m given access limitations . The thermo - couple errors ( 0 . 45 % ± 2 °C , junction error plus thermocouple error ) are unsuitable for measuring instantaneous ﬂ uctuations in temperature [ 27 ] . All thermocouples and the WXT520 were calibrated and corrected ( on average < 0 . 5 °C ) for instrument bias at the start and end of the experiment using an environmental chamber ( Design Environmental Delta 190H ) over a − 20 °C to 50 °C range , accounting for hysteresis e ﬀ ects due to instrumental time response . 3 . 2 . Tracer gas decay method set - up The combination of site limitations , safety concerns , a ﬀ ordability , lower environmental impact , wide range of sensors and lower risks ( cf . other tracer gases , e . g . Argon and SF 6 ) led to CO 2 being chosen as the tracer gas . The external CO 2 concentration ( C a ) was measured with an open path LI - COR LI - 7500 on the channel mast ( Fig . 1 , Table 1 ) . During the 10 - month study , C a varied between 365 and 450 ppm ( 95 % be - tween 371 and 403 ppm ) . Given the low natural variability ( standard deviation typically 3 – 4 ppm ) of C a during a decay experiment ( Table 3 ) , the mean C a for that period is used in equation ( 3 ) . The LI - COR LI - 7500 was su ﬃ ciently distant from the cube to ensure the tracer CO 2 releases did not have an e ﬀ ect . The three synchronised K30 NDIR sensors measuring internal CO 2 ( C i ) ( Fig . 3 , Table 1 ) were not electronically shielded . They were en - cased within modi ﬁ ed junction boxes to protect from frost , condensa - tion and to reduce magnetic noise ( Fig . 3 ) . Pre - experiment checks en - sured there was adequate air ﬂ ow to the sensors . The K30 sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer and compared in - house to the LI - 7500 in both a constant concentration test , and a decay from the sensor upper limit ( 10 , 000 ppm ) before and after the ﬁ eld campaign . None of the three sensors drifted over the course of the experiment . Fig . 3 shows the ‘ East ’ sensor ( E ) positioned under the east opening ( 1 m from the wall , 2 . 75 m above the ground ) . The ‘ Low ’ sensor ( L ) was hung under the steel girder of the east wall , ( 1 m from the North - East corner of the cube , 0 . 3 m above the ground ) . The ‘ Middle ’ sensor ( M ) was 3 m above the ground at the centre - point of the Northern wall ( ∼ 0 . 5 m from the wall ) but near a crack between the ﬂ oor and building to help understand in ﬁ ltration e ﬀ ects on the venti - lation rate . To reduce the in ﬁ ltration rates , cracks at the cube base were ﬁ lled with foam . Ideally more sensors would have been used to give more representative results of the cube over - all ventilation rate . The cube ' s nine inlet pipes ( Fig . 3 ) were used to release the tracer evenly throughout the cube .

Outlet number 6 was placed at ﬂ oor level in the centre of the room and had a pipe length ( outlet to reg - ulator ) of 2 . 2 m , whereas all others were 3 . 1 m . The CO 2 was heated by the regulator to approximately 10 °C to prevent the outlet freezing during release and to reduce the temperature di ﬀ erence between the tracer gas and the ambient air . Gas release was controlled externally . The procedural order for each tracer gas decay experiment was : 1 ) The openings ( if used ) were blocked from the outside with a tem - porary panel .

For in ﬁ ltration experiments , the cube was often left over - night due to the low air exchange rate The local air change rate ( λ ) for each sensor is calculated by linear ﬁ t ( equation ( 3 ) ) incorporating errors ( e . g . Fig . 5 , section 4 . 1 ) . The instrumental errors are accounted for in λ by ﬁ tting curves to measured data plus and minus the instrumental error ( Table 1 ) . The ﬁ nal venti - lation rate λ for an experiment is the average of all three sensors when a “ well - mixed ” criterion is satis ﬁ ed : ( i ) ﬂ ow structure veri ﬁ ed by ﬁ lming smoke release inside the cube or ( ii ) all 30 min horizontal ( di ﬀ erence of the average temperature of H1 , H2 and H7 , H8 ) and vertical temperature di ﬀ erences ( di ﬀ erence in average temperature of thermo - couples at 3 – 4 m and those at 0 – 1 . 5 m ) were less than 2 . 5 °C . The combination of temperature measurements and smoke releases elimi - nated 15 tracer gas releases from the dataset . Incomplete temperature or smoke data resulted in another 13 being excluded . Thus , 28 out of 156 releases were discarded . Only the tracer gas method permits in ﬁ ltration rate measurements , as the area of cracks and gaps could not be determined by other means . The mean in ﬁ ltration rate ( average of 15 in ﬁ ltration experiments , all wind directions ) is 0 . 562 h − 1 ( 0 . 034 m 3 s − 1 ) ( median 0 . 572 h − 1 ) with an inter - quartile range of 0 . 426 h − 1 ( 0 . 026 m 3 s − 1 ) and an error of approximately 5 % was removed from the total measured ventilation rate in all results presented ( see Table 3 ) . 3 . 3 . Pressure di ﬀ erence To measure the cube surface pressure , 30 external and 2 internal pressure taps were used . The external pressure taps had 7 mm holes located centrally on 0 . 6 m 2 steel panels . These were mounted ﬂ ush to the cube cladding . The taps , located closer together where sharper gradients in pressure were expected ( Fig . 4 ) , are in identical positions to [ 59 ] . Pressure signals were transmitted pneumatically , using 6 mm in - ternal diameter plastic tubes to transducers located within the cube , at a rate equivalent to 10 Hz . The sensors for taps 1 – 16 were Honeywell 163PC01D75 di ﬀ erential pressure sensors ; pressure taps 17 – 32 were Honeywell 163PC01D76 di ﬀ erential pressure sensors ( Table 1 ) . Two internal pressure taps were located directly under the openings on both the front and back of the cube . To combat instrument drift , the pressure tap system logged con - tinuously ( new ﬁ le every 30 min ) .

Building and Environment 137 ( 2018 ) 246 – 256 250 measurement ﬁ le 60 s of zero measurements based on a reference pressure and 60 s of calibration of the pressure transducers to the zero measurements were taken . The last second of data in each ﬁ le is not analysed as the valves switched to the reference rather than surface pressure . Reference pressure was measured with a static pressure probe at ground level ( custom - built as described in [ 49 ] ) . A reference dynamic pressure was measured using a directional pitot tube [ 37 ] at 6 m alongside the 6 m reference sonic anemometer ( Fig . 1 ) . External pres - sure was de ﬁ ned as the mean pressure measured around the opening at the front ( Taps 3 , 4 , 18 and 19 ) and back ( Taps 12 , 13 , 26 and 27 ) faces ( Fig . 4 ) . Tests undertaken of sealed and ventilated conditions found no e ﬀ ects of the opening on the mean surface pressure measurements closest to the opening . After the mean of the external taps is calculated , di ﬀ erence calcu - lations ( external and internal ) are performed for each 10 Hz reading . These di ﬀ erences ( averaged per 30 min ) is used in equation ( 5 ) to calculate Q P with a ﬂ ow direction dependent C d determined from wind tunnel tests . An open - ended wind tunnel ( cross section 1 . 7 m × 1 m , turbulence intensity ∼ 4 % ) was used with a model of the openings ( 0 . 4 m w x 1 m h x 0 . 23 m d ) . The sill pointed inwards for the inlet set up and outwards for the outlet set up . A fan within the rig drew air through the inlet cones . This was calibrated to give ﬂ ow rates from pressure at the conical outlet . Pressures inside the settling chamber box at the downstream end were measured by micro - manometer [ 50 ] . The test opening was mounted at the end of the settling box . Temperature , humidity and barometric pressure measurements allow for an accurate calculation of air density . Flow rates and resultant normalised pressure di ﬀ erences were compared , with the gradient between the two being equal to C d A ( Hoxey and Robertson , personal communication , 2015 ) . When acting as an inlet , C d = 0 . 616 ± 0 . 016 and as an outlet , C d = 0 . 658 ± 0 . 022 , with errors on C d being determined from the standard error of the ﬁ tted coe ﬃ cients . The local mean wind direction ( Front mast , Fig . 1 ) is used to select the C d . If the wind is from − 90° to 90° the inlet value is used , otherwise ( 91° to − 91° ) the outlet value is used . Directional ﬂ uctuations ( « 30 - min ) will introduce additional er - rors into the calculations . The errors in Q P are calculated with the error propagation method using the standard error of Δ p . Alternatively , the ventilation rates can be calculated for each in - stantaneous pressure measurement . The average of these is the mean ventilation rate . The two pressure - based methods have approximately a 10 % di ﬀ erence in 30 - min averages . This decreases to 3 – 5 % for 5 - min averages . 3 . 4 . Ventilation measurement summary Table 3 summarises the ventilation data . The 30 min averaging period for the pressure based ventilation and meteorological variables allows error statistics to be consistent with other meteorological studies [ 3 ] . The tracer gas decay length varied with experimental set up . Pressure - based ventilation rates from the full range of observed wind speeds are analysed , unlike earlier pressure coe ﬃ cient studies which restricted wind speeds ( e . g . [ 19 ] > 4 m s − 1 [ 49 ] , > 3 m s − 1 ) . Inclu - sion of lower wind speeds leads to higher scatter in the range of ven - tilation rates . The Archimedes number ( Ar ) : ratio of external forces to internal viscous forces can be used to determine whether a ﬂ ow is being driven by buoyant processes ( large Ar ) or is being a ﬀ ected by external pro - cesses ( e . g . wind driven , small Ar ) . The dataset has less than 10 cases where buoyant forces are completely dominant ; i . e . the most cares are wind driven . 4 . Results and discussion The pressure - based and tracer gas decay results are analysed in three ways : ( i ) error analysis is discussed and then a single tracer gas release case ( < 30 min ) is compared to the 1 , 5 , 10 and 30 min averages for pressure - based ventilation rate ( Q P ) for the same period ; ( ii ) the tracer gas decay timestamps are used for the Q P calculation times ; and ( iii ) all Q t rates are compared to the 30 min Q P averages for the entire dataset . The array and isolated cube data are treated separately . For more details about the sheltering e ﬀ ect of the array on the ventilation rate see [ 17 ] . To enable comparison across di ﬀ erent wind speeds , a normalised ventilation rate ( Q N ) is used : = Q Q A U N ref ( 6 ) where U ref is the reference wind speed taken at 6 m ( Fig . 1 ) . Tracer gas decay air changes per hour ( λ ) are converted into Q ( m 3 s − 1 ) before being normalised using equation ( 6 ) . Pressure di ﬀ erence derived ventilation rates are only used when the data series for that period is complete . 4 . 1 . Case study : isolated cube , cross ventilation During the isolated cube cross - ventilated case study ( 21 / 05 / 2015 ) the mean reference wind speed ( U ref ) is 5 . 3 m s − 1 ( standard deviation σ Uref = 0 . 24 m s − 1 ) and wind direction ( θ ref ) is 6° ( σ θ ref = 19° ) . The total time when the tracer gas was well - mixed within the cube was 9 min . The decay curves ( Fig . 5 ) are only for the 9 min well - mixed data . There is a gap in the pressure di ﬀ erence ventilation rate data ( Fig . 6 ) linked to the system calibration , meaning it zeroes itself every half hour ( Section 3 . 3 ) . For the tracer gas results , the “ Low ” sensor ( Fig . 3 , L ) has the greatest ventilation rate ( Fig . 5c , Table 4 ) . This sensor position ex - periences ﬂ ow exiting from both the back opening and a small gap at the base of the cube . This suggests that in ﬁ ltration may reinforce cross ventilation within the cube for this wind direction . However , the re - corded average in ﬁ ltration rate of the cube ( 0 . 034 m 3 s − 1 ) is ∼ 5 % of the measured ventilation rates ( Fig . 5b ) . The East and Mid [ CO 2 ] sen - sors have similar results ( Fig . 5a , c ) with the Low sensor being a ﬀ ected by the in ﬁ ltration rate , leading to faster decay rates in comparison Fig . 4 .

( drawing not to scale ) . Front and back faces are symmetrical as are the side faces [ 17 ] . H . L . Gough et al . Building and Environment 137 ( 2018 ) 246 – 256 251 ( Fig . 5d ) . For all tracer gas releases , the error is presented as the standard deviation of the measured , maximum and minimum ventila - tion rates for all sensors . The in ﬁ ltration rate of the cube may act against or reinforce the ventilation rate and as such is also included as an error on each ventilation rate ( Table 4 ) . Comparison of the pressure - based normalised ventilation rate ( Q NP ) for di ﬀ erent averaging times ( 1 , 5 , 10 , and 30 - min ) with Q NT mostly agrees within error the bounds for this case ( Fig . 6 ) . Within the release period , the pressure measurements were calibrated ( gap in in - stantaneous results , Fig . 6 ) . Most of the 1 - min average Q P values are within the Q T range . As expected , the variability of instantaneous Q P measurements is not en - tirely captured by these . The 5 - and 10 - min averages also lie within the Q T range . The 30 - min mean Q P is close to the lowest Q T rate as the instantaneous Q P values decrease after the decay period . Overall , the averaged Q P values are closer to the lower estimate of Q T , but shorter averaging times capture the variability of the ventilation rate . This case study suggests the pressure method tends to under - predict compared to the tracer gas method , in line with [ 52 ] . However , the missing data complicates this result . This conclusion is tested across all array , ven - tilation and meteorological conditions in the following sections . 4 . 2 . Comparison of tracer gas and pressure - based ventilation rates The normalised ventilation rates calculated from pressure ( Q NP ) and tracer gas ( Q NT ) data are compared for all the tracer gas release times , for both isolated and array cube cases in single - sided ventilation ( Fig . 7a ) and cross ( Fig . 7b ) con ﬁ gurations . There is no obvious linear relation between Q NP and Q NT ( Table 5 ) . However consistent with Fig . 6 , both normalised ventilation rates ( Fig . 7 ) have a similar order of magnitude . The lack of correlation between the two methods suggests that they are a ﬀ ected by di ﬀ erent parameters in dissimilar ways . Straw et al . [ 59 ] used a larger ( 1 m 2 ) opening and found the pressure based method were 21 % of the tracer gas ventilation rate . Across the con - ﬁ gurations analysed , and consistent with [ 10 ] and [ 52 ] ; the pressure di ﬀ erence method is an unreliable predictor of the ventilation rate measured through tracer gas decay . The poor agreement for individual periods for the single - sided ventilation cases ( Fig . 7a ) may be caused by bi - directional ﬂ ow across the opening . This process is not captured by the pressure measurements surrounding the opening . For the cross - ventilation array case ( Fig . 7b ) , there may be improved internal mixing due to the enhanced un - steadiness of the ﬂ ow with the array enhancing the e ﬀ ectiveness of the tracer gas measurement . However , the assumptions required for the ori ﬁ ce equation may not hold for cross ventilation . Some of the error for the pressure - based method may arise from the discharge coe ﬃ cient used not being valid for all wind directions [ 29 ] . It must also be acknowledged that the tracer gas derived ventilation rate may not be representative of the entire cube and rather a local ventilation measurement ( e . g . large errors Table 5 ) , causing di ﬀ erences Fig . 5 .

Normalised tracer gas ( Q T ) and pressure - based ( Q P ) ventilation rates for the 21 / 05 / 2015 case study . Q P averages for 1 , 5 , 10 and 30min periods ( black line ) and for the 9min gas release ( magenta ) . This case study had lower errors compared to the average ( Fig . 7 has more examples ) . Dashed lines denote the range of tracer gas ventilation rates . H . L . Gough et al . Building and Environment 137 ( 2018 ) 246 – 256 252 between the two methods . The representatively of the tracer gas ven - tilation rate for each experiment is di ﬃ cult to quantify and the cube itself may not remain well - mixed throughout the decay , as evident in deviations from the exponential decay ( Fig . 5 ) . 4 . 3 . E ﬀ ect of wind direction When the data from Fig . 7 are analysed as a ratio ( Q NT / Q NP ) with the reference wind direction ( θ ref ) it is evident that wind direction has an in ﬂ uence ( Fig . 8 ) . Large errors occur in the ratios as these are now combined across the two methods . For the single - sided case , the ratio is generally below 1 , suggesting that the pressure - based method over - estimates ventilation rate . For the isolated single sided cube , Q NT / Q NP is around 1 for θ ref = − 100° to − 145° and θ ref = 150° , suggesting that better agreement occurs between the methods when the ﬂ ow is not impacting on the front face of the cube ( opening side ) . For the isolated single - sided cube , as θ ref decreases from 150° towards 0° , Q NT / Q NP tends towards 0 . 5 , although for θ ref = 60° – 70° a range of Q NT / Q NP of 0 . 4 – 0 . 7 is measured . Other factors , such as wind speed ﬂ uctuations in separated ﬂ ow around the opening ( causing mixing at the opening ) may have an e ﬀ ect alongside wind direction . It also might suggest that the thermal com - ponent of the ventilation tends to act against the wind driven compo - nent for ﬂ ows perpendicular to the opening , leading to a lower ventilation rate measured by the tracer gas . For the present study , in - ternal - external temperature di ﬀ erences were mostly less than 5 °C , meaning that the stack e ﬀ ect is small and is very rarely dominant for both singled sided and cross ventilated con ﬁ gurations . It is unknown how representative the internal - external temperature di ﬀ erence is compared to the across opening di ﬀ erence . For both the single - sided and cross - ventilated isolated cubes there are a few points with ra - tios > 2 , i . e . Q NP « Q NT . For the single - sided case this occurs when the wind is impacting the cube back and is twice the ratio of measurements for similar wind directions ( Fig . 8a ) . For the cross ventilated cube , there are insu ﬃ cient data to determine the cause ( Fig . 8b ) . The cross ventilated isolated cube in general has higher values of Q NT / Q NP than those measured for the single sided case . For the cross ventilated isolated cube , when θ ref was perpendicular to the front opening ( θ ref = 0° ) , Q NT / Q NP was approximately 0 . 6 , increasing to 1 to 1 . 5 when θ ref ∼ 45° , suggesting that it is important to note wind di - rection when concluding whether the pressure di ﬀ erence method overestimates ( Q NT / Q NP = 0 . 6 ) or underestimates ( Q NT / Q NP = 1 . 5 ) the ventilation rate . This may be in ﬂ uenced by the internal mixing state of the cube . CFD simulations of the cube ' s internal ﬂ ow [ 32 , 33 ] : a jet was present for − 45° < θ ref < 45° for the isolated cube ; and for the array case internal ﬂ ow was too unsteady for a jet to be sustained . For similar wind di - rections ( e . g . θ ref = 0° ) the jet was also seen via smoke visualisation for Table 4 Tracer gas ventilation rate ( Q T , m 3 s − 1 ) for the cross ventilated isolated cube case study on 21 / 05 / 2015 with air changes per hour ( λ , h − 1 ) .

Comparison of the normalised ventilation rates for pressure method ( Q NP ) and tracer gas decay ( Q NT ) for a ) single - sided and b ) cross - ventilated cases . Pressure data are averaged for the period of each tracer gas experiment . Error bars are the mea - surement error of the instruments propagated through equation ( 5 ) for the pressure di ﬀ erence method , and the standard deviation of the measured , maximum and minimum rates for the tracer gas decay ( Table 4 ) . H . L . Gough et al . Building and Environment 137 ( 2018 ) 246 – 256 253 both single sided and cross ventilated cases but was often disrupted by ﬂ uctuations in wind direction . There may be better agreement between the ventilation methods when there is not a strong internal jet , and instead unsteady mixing dominates , though more data are required to con ﬁ rm this . Another possible reason is the variation of C d with wind direction , which is given one of two values in this study . For the isolated case , θ ref is similar to θ local ( Fig . 1 ) and little dif - ference in relation with wind direction can be seen when Figs . 8 and 9 are compared . Except when the reference ﬂ ow is coming from behind the cube ( θ ref = 180° ) and θ local is 45° – 135° and − 45° to − 135° , in - dicating that the local mast is in the recirculation region in front of the cube . This is related to the non - linear relation between θ ref and θ local ( for detail see [ 17 ] ) . Fig . 9a shows that the wide range of θ ref for the single sided array corresponds to a narrow range in θ local = 0° – 45° , suggesting that the array “ channels ” the ﬂ ow for these reference wind directions . Q NT / Q NP is approximately 0 . 3 , suggesting for when ﬂ ow is not quite perpendicular to the opening , the pressure di ﬀ erence method consistently overestimates the ventilation rate . For the cross ventilated array case there is a wider range of θ local than θ ref , suggesting that the local mast is located within overlapping wakes from neighbouring cubes , and the wide spread in Q NT / Q NP is visible across the range in θ local . Some of this spread , such as for θ local = 90° , could be associated with the ﬂ ow across the opening being caused by turbulent e ﬀ ects . Fig . 9b indicates that local wind direction alone is not enough to ex - plain the di ﬀ erence in the two methods . Determining which parameters have the largest e ﬀ ect on the ratio between the two methods is di ﬃ cult , although it is shown to be dependent on wind direction for all cases . 5 . Conclusions The large data set measured during the REFRESH Cube Campaign has enabled a detailed evaluation of two ventilation rate measurement methods ( tracer gas decay , pressure - based ) for a simpli ﬁ ed building across a wide range of conditions : wind speed and direction , single - sided and cross - ventilated con ﬁ gurations , and isolated and staggered building array . This provides a substantial contribution to the under - standing of the relative performance of the two methods under realistic meteorological conditions for a simpli ﬁ ed built environment . Errors in the tracer gas measurements are carefully considered . Results demonstrated that a single sensor does not necessarily give a ventilation rate representative of the whole space , and that some wind conditions led to more spatial variability and thus higher errors . Maximum and minimum ﬁ ts of a decay curve to concentration data within margins of measurement error are used to estimate the error for Fig . 8 . Ratio of normalised ventilation rates for the two methods with reference wind direction for ( a ) single - sided and ( b ) cross ventilated cases for the array and the isolated cube . Fig . 9 . As Fig . 8 but for the local wind direction ( θ local ) . H . L . Gough et al . Building and Environment 137 ( 2018 ) 246 – 256 254 the ventilation rate at each measurement location ; then all estimates are averaged across all three sensors . Assessment of pressure method averaging times , suggests 10 min or greater is needed to obtain a reliable measure of the average ventilation rate within the cube . Shorter periods are too variable compared to tracer gas results . However , shorter timescales show the variability with external conditions . Agreement between the two normalised ventilation rates ( tracer gas ( Q NT ) and pressure methods ( Q NP ) ) for the four con - ﬁ gurations ( single - sided and cross ventilated , isolated and array ) is poor . The pressure di ﬀ erence method does not capture similar venti - lation rates to the tracer gas methodology . Both ventilation rate methods have their shortcomings : tracer gas - requiring a well - mixed internal environment and minimal in ﬁ ltration ; and pressure di ﬀ erence - needing knowledge of C d and how it changes with wind direction alongside several assumptions which are unlikely to always hold in realistic outdoor ﬂ ow . The ratio Q NT / Q NP changes with reference wind direction . For single - sided ventilation it approached 1 when the opening was on the leeward side of the cube in the wake , and otherwise was small for windward ﬂ ows , suggesting that the pressure method was an over - estimate . For cross ventilation , the ratio was closer to 1 although there was more scatter . There was a slight trend for the ratio to approach 1 when the ﬂ ow was not directly perpendicular to the front face for the isolated case . There may be better agreement when the internal mixing state is less dominated by a single jet , i . e . for oblique wind directions for the isolated case , and in general for the array case where external ﬂ ows are highly unsteady . Sheltering may also reduce the ﬂ ushing rate of the tracer gas from the cube relative to internal mixing rate . The work could be extended by comparing the methods within controlled environments where the true ventilation rate is known , e . g . wind tunnel experiments . CFD modelling of the internal ﬂ ow and tracer gas dispersion would aid sensor positioning and allow either stagnant or jet areas to be avoided or actively focused on . Whilst some of the di ﬀ erences between methods may be explained by changing wind di - rections , more work is required to explore simultaneous thermal e ﬀ ects , e ﬀ ects of sensor positioning and variations in the internal ﬂ ow .
