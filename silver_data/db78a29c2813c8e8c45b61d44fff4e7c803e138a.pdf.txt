CD2 - associated protein directly interacts with the actin cy - toskeleton . Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 283 : F734 – F743 , 2002 . First published May 7 , 2002 ; 10 . 1152 / ajprenal . 00312 . 2001 . — CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) is an adapter protein asso - ciating with several membrane proteins , including nephrin , mutated in congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type , and polycystin - 2 , mutated in type 2 autosomal domi - nant polycystic kidney disease . Both proteins have critical roles in the maintenance of the integrity of the nephrons . Previous studies have suggested a role for CD2AP in the regulation of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton , but it has not been known whether the postulated association be - tween CD2AP and actin is direct or mediated by other pro - teins . In this study , we address this question by using vari - ous cellular and biochemical approaches . We show that CD2AP and F - actin partially colocalize in cultured cells and that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton results in disorga - nization of endogenous CD2AP . Using cytoskeletal fraction - ation by differential centrifugation , we demonstrate that a proportion of CD2AP associates with the actin cytoskeleton . Furthermore , using pure actin and puriﬁed CD2AP fusion proteins in an F - actin coprecipitation assay , we show that CD2AP directly associates with ﬁlamentous actin and that this interaction is mediated by means of the COOH terminus of CD2AP . The present results suggest that CD2AP is in - volved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and indicate that CD2AP may act as a direct adapter between the actin cytoskeleton and cell membrane proteins , such as nephrin and polycystin - 2 . Alterations in these interactions could ex - plain some of the pathophysiological changes in congenital nephrotic syndrome and polycystic kidney disease . METS - 1 ; microﬁlaments ; nephrotic syndrome ; polycystic kid - ney disease ; SH3 domain IN THE SEARCH FOR NOVEL developmentally regulated genes in the developing mouse kidney , we used differ - ential hybridization to identify a gene that is strongly upregulated during mesenchyme - to - epithelium transi - tion ( 13 , 18 ) . The encoded protein , originally named METS - 1 ( mesenchyme - to - epithelium transition pro - tein with multiple SH3 domains ) ( 18 ) , is identical to CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) , which has been iden - tiﬁed from mouse T cells as a CD2 cell adhesion pro - tein - binding partner ( 6 ) . The human homolog of CD2AP , Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains ( CMS ) , was identiﬁed as a focal adhesion protein p130 Cas - associated protein ( 16 ) . CD2AP is an 80 - kDa protein that is widely expressed in tissues ( 6 , 16 , 19 ) . The protein includes several putative protein - protein interaction domains , suggest - ing that CD2AP is an adapter molecule . Thus CD2AP contains three SH3 domains in its NH 2 - terminal re - gion , a proline - rich region in the midregion , and a coiled - coil domain and actin - binding sites in the COOH terminus ( 6 , 16 , 18 ) . SH3 domains are conserved pro - tein modules known to interact with proline - rich se - quences ( 21 , 24 ) that are present in a variety of signal - ing and cytoskeletal proteins . The proline - rich region of CD2AP provides several putative binding sites for SH3 domains , and coiled - coil domains are known to mediate protein - protein interactions . In accord with its proposed function as an adapter molecule , CD2AP has been shown to have several in - teraction partners . In the kidney in vivo , CD2AP asso - ciates with polycystin - 2 ( 18 ) and nephrin ( 21a , 27 , 28 ) , which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the nephrons ( 15 , 20 ) . In T cells , CD2AP binds the adhe - sion molecule CD2 , enhancing its clustering at the T cell - antigen - presenting cell contact area , thereby af - fecting the cytoskeletal polarity of the cells ( 6 ) . In addition , CD2AP interacts with the protoncogene prod - uct c - Cbl ( 17 ) , which is involved in tyrosine kinase signaling and regulation of lamellipodia formation and cell morphology ( 26 ) . Collectively , CD2AP may thus act as a scaffolding protein in various signaling cascades controlling cellular adhesion , motility , and morphol - ogy , all processes depending on the actin cytoskeleton . Interestingly , mice lacking CD2AP develop ne - phrotic syndrome resembling the human disease . These mice show effacement of the podocyte foot pro - cesses and accumulation of mesangial deposits ( 28 ) . Podocyte foot process effacement and the subsequent development of proteinuria is characterized by disag - gregation and redistribution of podocyte actin micro - ﬁlaments . This suggests an important role for actin and / or the associated proteins in the maintenance of Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : E .

In line with this , mutations in several actin - associated proteins have been shown to lead to glomerular disease . Thus muta - tions in the ACTN4 gene , encoding (cid:1) - actinin - 4 , cause familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( 14 ) , and mutations in the podocin gene NPHS2 lead to autoso - mal recessive steroid - resistant nephrotic syndrome ( 3 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence studies on cultured podocytes showed that CD2AP colocalizes with F - actin at the leading edge of lamellipodia and in small spots , which were unevenly distributed in the cytoplasm . The spot - shaped F - actin structures were also positive for the Arp2 / 3 protein complex and cortactin ( 36 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex has been shown to be activated by cortactin and to be involved in the regulation of actin assembly ( 32 , 35 ) . In addition , transient transfection of COS - 7 cells with CMS , the human homolog of CD2AP , has been shown to decrease actin ﬁber formation and lead to concentration of actin into small dots ( 16 ) . CD2AP may thus have a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , and the effacement of the podocyte foot processes in CD2AP - deﬁcient mice could result from dysregulation of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton orga - nization . The above studies on CD2AP and actin cytoskeleton organization rely on immunohistochemistry and do not reveal whether the postulated association between CD2AP and actin is direct or involves mediator pro - teins . In the present investigation , we have analyzed the association of F - actin and CD2AP at both the cellular and the biochemical levels . Our results indi - cate that the intracellular localization of CD2AP de - pends on an intact actin cytoskeleton and that CD2AP associates with the actin cytoskeleton . Most impor - tantly , by direct coprecipitation assays utilizing pure polymerized actin and puriﬁed CD2AP fusion proteins , we show , for the ﬁrst time , that the COOH terminus of CD2AP interacts directly with F - actin . These results suggest that CD2AP functions as a scaffolding protein connecting the actin cytoskeleton to plasma membrane proteins , such as CD2 , nephrin , and polycystin - 2 . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell culture . Mouse M - 1 kidney cortical collecting duct epithelial cells ( CRL - 2038 , American Type Culture Collec - tion ) were cultured in a 1 : 1 mixture of Ham’s F - 12 medium / Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing 5 (cid:2) M dexa - methasone and supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum . Production of CD2AP antisera . The rabbit antiserum ( R1774 ) generated against amino acid residues 6 – 574 of CD2AP has been described ( 18 ) . An independent rabbit an - tiserum ( R211 ) was raised against a glutathione S - trans - ferase ( GST ) - tagged fusion protein carrying amino acid resi - dues 1 – 330 of CD2AP . The fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed as recommended by the manu - facturer ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . To show the spec - iﬁcity of the antibody reactivity , the antisera were diluted to working concentration and preincubated with the corre - sponding puriﬁed recombinant protein at 1 or 10 (cid:2) g / ml at room temperature for 30 min , followed by Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , respectively ; this to - tally competed the signal ( Lehtonen S , unpublished observa - tions ) . Afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies were obtained by incubat - ing the antisera with the corresponding fusion protein immobilized on ﬁlter , followed by thorough washes . The antibodies were eluted using 0 . 2 M glycine - HCl , pH 2 . 9 , and neutralized with unbuffered 1 M Tris . The afﬁnity - puriﬁed antiserum R211 was used for immunoelectron microscopy ; all other analyses were performed with antiserum R1774 . The results with afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies and antisera were the same . Immunocytochemistry . Cells grown on glass coverslips were ﬁxed in 3 . 5 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 min or with (cid:3) 20°C methanol for 10 min . Oregon green 514 phalloi - din and rhodamine phalloidin for detection of F - actin were purchased from Molecular Probes , and the mouse monoclonal antibodies against actin and paxillin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Zymed , respectively . The mouse monoclonal antibodies against E - cadherin and protein disul - ﬁde isomerase ( PDI ) were from Transduction Laboratories and StressGen , respectively . Primary antibodies and the FITC / TRITC - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson Im - munoResearch Laboratories ) were diluted in PBS supple - mented with 0 . 5 % saponin and 5 % fetal calf serum . Micros - copy was performed with a Zeiss Axiophot 2 microscope and a Leica TCSSP1 confocal microscope . Immunoelectron microscopy . Nickel grids placed on cover - slips were covered with Formvar and coated with carbon . The grid assemblies were dipped into 1 % poly - L - lysine ( molecular weight 114 , 700 ; Sigma ) and rinsed with PBS , followed by incubation in a moist chamber overnight to make the surface wettable . The assemblies were sterilized with ethanol and rinsed with PBS and culture medium . M - 1 cells were plated on the grid assemblies at a density allowing them to reach 70 % conﬂuency in 3 days to ensure proper attachment and spreading on the grids . The cells were rinsed with 0 . 1 mM PIPES , pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , 4 % polyethylene glycol 8000 [ microﬁlament stabilizing buffer ( MSB ) ] , followed by incuba - tion with 1 mM short - arm crosslinker dithiobis ( succinimidyl propionate ) ( Pierce ) in MSB . Cells were extracted with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM dithiobis ( succinimidyl propionate ) in MSB before ﬁxation with 3 . 5 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( 2 ) . Filamentous actin was stabilized by 20 (cid:2) M phalloidin ( Mo - lecular Probes ) in PBS , and the cells were stained with afﬁnity - puriﬁed rabbit polyclonal CD2AP antibodies , a rabbit preimmune serum , and mouse monoclonal anti - actin anti - bodies ( Sigma ) . Cells were ﬁrst washed with PBS , followed by a rinse in 20 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM NaCl , and 0 . 01 % gelatin [ Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) buffer ] . Colloidal gold - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 5 - nm gold anti - rabbit and 10 - nm gold anti - mouse , Sigma ) were diluted in TBS . Cells were washed with TBS and postﬁxed with 2 . 5 % glutaralde - hyde , followed by washing with H 2 O and dehydration in ascending concentrations of acetone . The samples were crit - ical point - dried in a CPD - 30 apparatus ( Balzers ) and ob - served under a JEOL JEM 1200EX electron microscope . Cytoskeleton disrupting treatments . Mouse M - 1 kidney cells growing on glass coverslips were treated with 2 (cid:2) M cytochalasin D ( Sigma ) or 3 (cid:2) M jasplakinolide ( Calbiochem ) in culture medium at 37°C for 1 h and thereafter processed for immunocytochemistry . In some experiments , the cytocha - lasin D - treated cells were allowed to recover in the mainte - nance medium for 1 h before ﬁxation .

M - 1 cells cultured on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 4 M glycerol , 25 mM PIPES , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , pH 6 . 9 , at room tem - perature for 5 min ( 1 ) . Immunocytochemistry was performed as above . Preparation of cytoskeletal fractions . Mouse M - 1 kidney cells were grown to 90 % conﬂuency , washed with cold PBS , and lysed in 150 (cid:2) l of precooled ( in mM ) 100 Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 100 NaCl , 10 EGTA , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 PMSF , 10 NaF , 2 Na 3 VO 4 , 10 (cid:4) - glycerophosphate , and 0 . 2 ATP ( lysis buffer ) , as well as 2 % Triton X - 100 , 5 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , and 5 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin ( 7 ) on ice . In some experiments , 2 mg / ml DNase I ( preincubated with 1 mM PMSF on ice for 15 min ) were added to the lysis buffer to depolymerize ﬁlamentous actin ( 7 ) . After shaking in an ice bath for 15 min , the crude cytoskeleton fraction was prepared by centrifuging at 10 , 000 g at 4°C for 10 min . The supernatant was further centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge at 100 , 000 g at 4°C for 3 h to separate the membrane skeleton and soluble fractions . The pellets were washed three times and resuspended in lysis buffer , raising their volumes to correspond to the volume of the soluble fraction . Equal volumes of the crude cytoskeleton , membrane skeleton , and soluble fractions were resolved by SDS - PAGE and Western blotted with antibodies against ac - tin ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) or CD2AP . Actin ﬁlament precipitation assays . Truncated forms of CD2AP encompassing the NH 2 - and COOH - terminal do - mains of the protein ( amino acids 1 – 330 and 331 – 637 , re - spectively ) were subcloned into pGEX - 4T - 1 vector ( Amer - sham Pharmacia Biotech ) to produce GST - tagged fusion proteins . The fusion proteins were produced in E . coli and puriﬁed as recommended by the manufacturer ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( Cytoskel - eton ) was diluted in G buffer [ ( in mM ) 5 Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 dithiothreitol , and 0 . 2 ATP ] to produce a ﬁnal concentration of 3 (cid:2) M in the 50 (cid:2) l polymerization reaction volume . Actin was polymerized by adding 5 (cid:2) l of 10 (cid:5) actin polymerization initiation buffer [ 10 (cid:5) buffer ( in mM ) 500 KCl , 20 MgCl 2 , and 10 ATP ] followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min . The CD2AP GST fusion proteins , or GST as a control , were diluted in G buffer to produce a ﬁnal concentration of 1 (cid:2) M in the 50 (cid:2) l polymerization volume . The concentration of the intact COOH - terminal fusion pro - tein was estimated from Coomassie blue - stained gels . The fusion proteins were combined with polymerized actin and incubated at room temperature for 30 min . The samples were centrifuged in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge at 100 , 000 g at 4°C for 1 h . The pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer , and equal amounts of the supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS - PAGE . The Coomassie blue - stained gels were scanned , and the intensities of actin and the fusion protein bands were quantiﬁed by using the NIH Image 1 . 62 program . RESULTS Distribution of endogenous CD2AP in cultured cells . The sequence of CD2AP predicts a cytosolic protein with no apparent membrane spanning regions ( 6 , 16 , 18 ) . Accordingly , the predominant distribution pattern of CD2AP in various cultured cells is cytosolic , concen - trating around the nucleus in a ﬁne , reticular pattern ( Fig . 1 , A – D ) . Double staining for CD2AP and PDI revealed colocalization of the two proteins , suggesting that cytosolic CD2AP localizes to endoplasmic reticu - lum ( data not shown ) . In addition , accumulation of CD2AP to certain subcellular locations could be seen . In sparsely plated , well - spread cells , CD2AP accumu - lations were seen along the leading edge formations ( Fig . 1 A ) colocalizing with F - actin ( Fig . 1 , D – F ) . Accu - mulations of CD2AP were also detected in intercellular contact regions ( Fig . 1 B ) and in plaque - like structures often localizing close to cell - cell contacts ( Fig . 1 C ) . These plaque - like accumulations of CD2AP were found in solitary cells , subconﬂuent cells , and conﬂuent cells . The distribution of these structures differed from that of paxillin - positive focal adhesion plaques , although double staining for CD2AP and paxillin revealed par - tial overlap of the speciﬁc signals on rare occasions ( Fig . 1 , G – I ) . In subconﬂuent cells , paxillin - positive focal adhesions were frequently seen in the leading edge regions but rarely in cell - cell contact regions ( data not shown ) . The latter , however , regularly showed con - centrations of CD2AP ( Fig . 1 , A – C ) . To analyze whether the CD2AP concentrations colo - calize with proteins involved in cell contact formation , we performed double staining for CD2AP and E - cad - herin , a component of the cell - cell adherens junction . Analysis of sparsely plated cells revealed both CD2AP and E - cadherin in cellular projections extending from one cell to another on cell contact formation ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) . In subconﬂuent cultures , CD2AP partially colo - calized with E - cadherin in cell - cell contact sites ( Fig . 2 , D – F ) , suggesting that CD2AP may associate with ad - herens junctions . Collectively , the majority of CD2AP appears in the cytosol colocalizing with a marker ( PDI ) for endoplasmic reticulum , but a fraction of the protein accumulates in motile cellular structures and cell - cell contacts , suggesting that CD2AP could be involved in controlling cell movement and adhesion . Redistribution of CD2AP after cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide treatments . The NH 2 terminus of CD2AP contains three SH3 domains ( 6 , 16 , 18 ) . Many SH3 domain proteins are known to associate with cytoskeletal components and to direct the proteins to speciﬁc subcellular regions ( 1 ) . The COOH terminus of CD2AP contains sequences implicated in binding actin ( 33 , 34 ) . To investigate whether CD2AP associates with the actin cytoskeleton , M - 1 cells growing on cov - erslips were subjected to cytochalasin D and jas - plakinolide treatments ( Fig . 3 , A – I ) . Double staining of nontreated cells with CD2AP antibodies and phalloidin revealed cytosolic distribution of CD2AP , including pe - rinuclear accumulation , but also a distinct signal in the cell periphery rich in F - actin ( Fig . 3 , A – C ) . Cytochala - sin D , which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton , had a dramatic effect on CD2AP organization . In treated cells , CD2AP appeared as aggregates largely colocaliz - ing with the collapsed actin along the cell periphery ( Fig . 3 , D – F ) . On recovery in the maintenance medium , the cytoplasmic and ﬁlamentous staining patterns , re - spectively , of CD2AP and F - actin were restored ( not shown ) . Jasplakinolide stabilizes F - actin and induces actin polymerization ( 4 ) . Jasplakinolide treatment caused a redistribution of CD2AP into large aggre - gates , partially colocalizing with masses of actin , which F736 CD2AP ASSOCIATES WITH ACTIN AJP - Renal Physiol • VOL 283 • OCTOBER 2002 • www . ajprenal . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 5 on O c t obe r 29 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p r ena l . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m was visualized using anti - actin antibodies ( Fig . 3 , G – I ) . The results indicate that the organization of CD2AP depends on intact actin cytoskeleton . CD2AP is partially retained in detergent - extracted cells . To further investigate the association between CD2AP and the actin cytoskeleton , we used detergent extraction to produce cytoskeleton preparations of ad - herent M - 1 cells for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . In these preparations , proteins not connected to the cytoskeleton are extracted . In the detergent - extracted M - 1 cells , most of the CD2AP - speciﬁc ﬂuorescence was lost ( Fig . 3 J ) . However , some CD2AP was retained along the cell periphery in the cell contact regions and as diffusely distributed small granular structures ( Fig . 3 J ) . The extraction did not alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 3 K ) . The cytoskeleton prepara - tions exhibited regions positive for both F - actin and CD2AP , but also regions showing either F - actin or CD2AP alone ( Fig . 3 , J and K ) . The cells also showed distinct focal adhesion plaques positive for paxillin ( not shown ) . The results indicate that a fraction of CD2AP is resistant to detergent extraction , suggesting that CD2AP may associate with the actin cytoskeleton . CD2AP and actin colocalize in cortical actin cytoskel - eton . To further conﬁrm the close association of CD2AP and actin , detergent - extracted whole - mount cells were studied by immunoelectron microscopy . Actin and ac - tin - associated proteins were stabilized by a cross - linker before detergent extraction , and after the ex - traction , actin was further stabilized by treatment with phalloidin . As a result , the actin cytoskeleton was well preserved , and the motile structures of the cell , such as lamellipodia , leading edges , membrane rufﬂes , and microspikes , were clearly discernible ( Fig . 4 A ) . In immunoelectron microscopy , distinct CD2AP - speciﬁc staining could be detected in the cell periphery , espe - cially in leading edges ( Fig . 4 B ) .

Controls using rabbit preimmune serum showed negligible labeling ( Fig . 4 C ) . After double staining for CD2AP and actin , colabeling of the same structures was seen , suggesting a close association of the two proteins ( Fig . 4 D ) . A fraction of CD2AP pellets with membrane skeleton . Highly cross - linked actin ﬁlaments , representing the majority of ﬁlamentous actin , are pelleted at low - force centrifugation , and free or loosely cross - linked actin ﬁlaments , representing the submembranous actin ﬁl - aments , require high - speed centrifugation for sedimen - tation ( 7 , 30 ) . To analyze the partition of CD2AP in these two cytoskeletal structures , we prepared M - 1 cell extracts and analyzed equal volumes of the 10 , 000 g crude cytoskeleton fraction , the 100 , 000 - g membrane skeleton fraction , and the remaining Triton X - 100 - soluble fraction by Western blotting ( Fig . 5 , lanes marked DNase I (cid:3) ) . Most of the CD2AP protein was found in the Triton X - 100 - soluble fraction [ 100 , 000 soluble ( S ) , DNase I (cid:3) ] . Of the cytoskeleton - associated CD2AP , most was found in the high - speed membrane skeleton fraction [ 100 , 000 pellet ( P ) , DNase I (cid:3) ] and a negligible part in the crude cytoskeleton fraction ( 10 , 000 P , DNase I (cid:3) ) . As expected , most of the actin pelleted in the crude cytoskeleton fraction ( 10 , 000 P , DNase I (cid:3) ) . The presence of CD2AP in the membrane skeleton fraction could be due to either Triton X - 100 insolubility of the protein or its association with actin ﬁlaments . To distinguish between these two possibilities , we depoly - merized ﬁlamentous actin by using DNase I treatment ( Fig . 5 , lanes marked DNase I (cid:6) ) as described earlier ( 7 ) . The depolymerization of F - actin was conﬁrmed by Western blots showing the absence of the free or loosely cross - linked actin in the membrane skeleton fraction after DNase I treatment ( Fig . 5 , 100 , 000 P , DNase I (cid:6) ) . The depolymerization of F - actin led to a partitioning of CD2AP exclusively in the Triton X - 100 - soluble fraction ( Fig . 5 , 100 , 000 S , DNase I (cid:6) ) , suggest - ing that the protein , indeed , is actin associated . The COOH terminus of CD2AP directly associates with F - actin . To investigate whether CD2AP and F - actin interact directly , we performed an F - actin precip - itation assay using COOH - and NH 2 - terminal GST - fusion proteins of CD2AP . For this , pure , polymerized actin was mixed with the puriﬁed CD2AP fusion pro - teins . The samples were then centrifuged to pellet ﬁlamentous actin and the possible bound fusion pro - teins . Analysis of equal amounts of the soluble and pelleted fractions revealed that under the conditions used , about one - half of the COOH - terminal fusion pro - Fig . 2 .

In the absence of actin , the COOH - terminal fusion protein pelleted at a negligible level , suggesting that it does not precipitate by itself ( Fig . 6 A , lanes marked actin (cid:3) ) . Densitometric analysis showed that (cid:7) 60 % of the COOH - terminal CD2AP used in the assay cosedimented with F - actin ( Fig . 6 B , C (cid:6) actin ) . In contrast , the NH 2 - terminal fusion protein pelleted at a similar level in the absence ( Fig . 6 C , lanes marked actin (cid:3) ) and presence ( Fig . 6 C , lanes marked actin (cid:6) ) of F - actin . This suggests that the NH 2 terminus of CD2AP does not bind actin but that a part of the Fig . 3 .

GST alone did not pellet in the absence ( Fig . 6 D , lanes marked actin (cid:3) ) or pres - ence ( Fig . 6 D , lanes marked actin (cid:6) ) of F - actin . DISCUSSION In the present study , we show that endogenous CD2AP and F - actin partially colocalize in cultured epithelial M - 1 cells and that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton results in disorganization of CD2AP . Us - ing cytoskeletal fractionation combined with actin de - polymerization , we show that a fraction of CD2AP associates with the membrane skeleton . Finally , using an F - actin coprecipitation assay , we show that the COOH terminus of CD2AP directly binds F - actin . Our immunoﬂuorescence and immunoelectron mi - croscopy analysis showed that the distribution of CD2AP is related to the locomotory status of the cells . The prevailing localization of CD2AP was cytosolic , colocalizing with a marker ( PDI ) for endoplasmic retic - ulum . However , in motile cells , CD2AP accumulations were also found along the leading edge , colocalizing with F - actin , and in plaque - like structures , which were distinct from paxillin - positive focal adhesion plaques . CD2AP has previously been shown to associate with the protoncogene product c - Cbl ( 17 ) , which is involved in tyrosine kinase signaling and regulation of lamelli - podia formation and cell morphology ( 26 ) . Localization of CD2AP in the leading edge of lamellipodia ( this study and Refs . 16 and 36 ) suggests that CD2AP might also have a role in these processes . Furthermore , tar - geting of c - Cbl to the actin cytoskeleton of NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts has been shown to require interaction with an actin - associated SH3 domain - containing protein ( 26 ) , such as CD2AP . CD2AP could thus act as a scaffolding protein in speciﬁc signaling cascades con - trolling cellular motility and morphology . The above immunoﬂuorescence colocalization stud - ies suggest a close association between CD2AP and a fraction of cellular F - actin . In the present study , we also obtained ﬁndings suggesting that CD2AP is asso - ciated with a distinct cytoskeletal fraction , the mem - brane skeleton . First , double staining of detergent - extracted cells revealed that although the majority of CD2AP was extracted from these cytoskeleton prepa - rations , a distinct fraction of the protein was retained Fig . 4 . Immunoelectron microscopy of detergent - extracted M - 1 cells . M - 1 cells growing on grids were treated with a short - arm cross - linker dithiobis ( succin - imidyl propionate ) to crosslink actin and the associated proteins , extracted with Triton X - 100 , and ﬁxed with para - formaldehyde .

CD2AP coprecipitates with the membrane skeleton fraction of M - 1 kidney epithelial cells . M - 1 cells were lysed in Triton X - 100 containing buffer without or with DNase I . The samples were cen - trifuged at 10 , 000 g to obtain a crude cytoskeleton fraction [ 10 , 000 pellet ( P ) ] . The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100 , 000 g to obtain the membrane skeleton ( 100 , 000 P ) and soluble [ 100 , 000 soluble ( S ) ] fractions . Equal amounts of each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against CD2AP and actin . In the lanes marked DNase I (cid:3) , some CD2AP sediments with the membrane skeleton with the rest of the protein remaining soluble . Most of the ﬁlamentous actin sediments in the 10 , 000 - g crude cytoskeleton fraction . In the lanes marked DNase I (cid:6) , depolymeriza - tion of F - actin by DNase I ( 7 ) results in complete removal of both CD2AP and actin from the membrane skeleton fraction ( 100 , 000 P ) . The lower band detected by the CD2AP antibodies in the soluble fraction ( 100 , 000 S ) after the DNase I treatment apparently repre - sents a degradation product .

Second , cytoskeletal fractionation conﬁrmed that the majority of CD2AP is soluble but that a fraction of the protein pellets with the loosely cross - linked actin ﬁla - ments or the membrane skeleton . The crude cytoskel - eton fraction , which includes highly cross - linked actin ﬁlaments , representing the majority of ﬁlamentous ac - tin , contained scarcely any CD2AP . Our results from actin ﬁlament coprecipitation as - say , using pure actin and puriﬁed CD2AP fusion pro - teins , demonstrate that the association between CD2AP and F - actin is direct and does not depend on mediator proteins . Furthermore , the results indicate that the interaction between CD2AP and F - actin is mediated by the COOH terminus of CD2AP . These results agree with the observation that the formation of the specialized cell contact between the T cell and the antigen presenting cell , a process involving adhe - sion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton ( 9 ) , is dis - turbed by overexpression of a CD2AP construct lacking the COOH terminus ( 6 ) . The studies reported here provide strong evidence that CD2AP may link the actin cytoskeleton to neph - rin , earlier shown to interact with CD2AP ( 21a , 27 , 28 ) . Nephrin has been suggested to form the framework of the slit diaphragm , the ultraﬁltration unit of the glo - merulus ( 11 , 12 , 25 ) . In congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type ( NPHS1 or CNF ) ( 10 ) , nephrin is mutated ( 15 ) , leading to loss of slit diaphragms and effacement of the podocyte foot processes ( 15 , 23 ) . As CD2AP (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice develop nephrotic syndrome resem - bling the human disease , CD2AP apparently has a role in maintaining the integrity of the slit diaphragm , supposedly as a protein anchoring nephrin to the cy - toskeleton ( 28 ) . Our present results support this pro - posal and show that CD2AP may act as a direct adapter between nephrin and the actin cytoskeleton . In line with this , while the present manuscript was under review , it was demonstrated that nephrin an - chors the slit diaphragm to the actin cytoskeleton , possibly by linkage to CD2AP ( 37 ) . Collectively , the data suggest that disturbances in the protein complex , including nephrin , CD2AP , and actin , could account for the alterations observed on foot process effacement in CNF and in CD2AP (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice . Our present and earlier ( 18 ) ﬁndings suggest that CD2AP may have an important role in the signaling cascade involved in the pathogenesis of the type 2 autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( AD - Fig . 6 . The COOH terminus of CD2AP directly associates with F - actin . A : COOH - terminal GST - fusion protein of CD2AP ( GST - C ; calculated molecular mass of 60 kDa ) was mixed with pure polymerized rabbit skeletal muscle actin . The sample was centrifuged to sediment actin ﬁlaments , and equal amounts of the supernatant ( sup . ) and pellet were resolved by SDS - PAGE ( lanes marked actin (cid:6) ) . As a control , the fusion protein was centrifuged without actin to detect possible precipitation of the protein by itself ( lanes marked actin (cid:3) ) . In the absence of actin , practically all of the GST - C protein is found in the supernatant ( sup . , actin (cid:3) ) , with a negligible amount in the pellet ( pellet , actin (cid:3) ) . In the presence of actin , about one - half of the GST - C protein is found in the supernatant ( sup . , actin (cid:6) ) and the other one - half in the pellet ( pellet , actin (cid:6) ) . The higher and lower molecular mass bands apparently represent aggregated and partially degraded forms of the fusion protein , respectively . Staining was with Coomassie blue . B : graphic presentation of the data from three independent F - actin coprecipitation experi - ments with the GST - COOH terminus of CD2AP .

C : in the case of the NH 2 - terminal GST - fusion protein of CD2AP ( GST - N ; calculated molecular mass of 63 kDa ) , partial pelleting of the protein was seen in both the absence ( lanes marked actin (cid:3) ) and the presence ( lanes marked actin (cid:6) ) of F - actin , indicating that the GST - N protein does not bind F - actin , but a minor proportion of it precipitates by itself . D : GST alone did not pellet in the absence ( lanes marked actin (cid:3) ) or presence ( lanes marked actin (cid:6) ) of F - actin .

In polycystic kidney disease , the kidney tubular cells lose their differentiated function and morphology , and the kidney develops cystic struc - tures lined by ﬂattened epithelial cells , a process ap - parently involving changes in cytoskeletal organiza - tion ( 5 ) . We have shown earlier that CD2AP interacts in vivo with polycystin - 2 ( 18 ) , mutated in ADPKD2 ( 20 ) . Mutations in ADPKD2 typically result in the production of truncated forms of polycystin - 2 ( see Ref . 31 ) , which might be unable to associate with CD2AP , because the interaction involves the COOH - terminal domain of polycystin - 2 ( 18 ) . The data would thus be compatible with a molecular mechanism , in which a mutation in ADPKD2 results in loss of connection , mediated by CD2AP , between polycystin - 2 and the actin cytoskeleton . This would then lead to the devel - opment of the morphological and pathophysiological changes observed in ADPKD2 . The signiﬁcance of in - tact cell membrane - actin cytoskeleton interactions for protein complexes containing polycystin - 2 is further emphasized by the observation that cytochalasin D disrupts polycystin - 1 / polycystin - 2 - containing macro - molecular complexes ( 8 ) . In line with the proposed role of CD2AP in the polycystin - 2 protein complex , we also show here that CD2AP partially colocalizes with E - cadherin , a component of this complex ( 8 ) . In conclusion , the present ﬁndings demonstrate a direct association between CD2AP and the actin cy - toskeleton and indicate that CD2AP may act as a direct adapter between the actin cytoskeleton and cell mem - bane proteins , such as nephrin and polycystin - 2 . Both nephrin and polycystin - 2 have been shown to interact with CD2AP in vivo , thus associating CD2AP with CNF and ADPKD2 , respectively . Collectively , the data suggest that disturbances in CD2AP - mediated interac - tions between membrane protein complexes and the actin cytoskeleton may have an important role in the pathogenesis of the changes characteristic to congeni - tal nephrotic syndrome and polycystic kidney disease .
