Scaling up machine learning , edited by Bekkerman , Bilenko , Langford , Cambridge University Press , 2012 , ISBN - 13 : 978 - 0521192248 Grading : Homework assignments 25pts One in - class presentation 25pts Final Project : 25pts In - class discussions 25pts Total : 100pts We will use the following scale to assign final grades ( tentative and curving will be used ) : A : over 90 % B : 80 % - 89 % C : 70 % - 79 % D : 60 % - 69 % F : below 60 % Extra Credit : Extra credits will be given to creativity and / or additional efforts shown in the team project and exams . Details will be given in the related assignments . Attendance : I expect you to come to lectures on a regular basis and will generally be unwilling to answer questions about material covered in a class you missed ( unless you were sick or had another legitimate excuse ) . You are responsible for all announcements made in class . Participation is encouraged ; please feel free to stop me if you do not understand something that has been said . Academic Misconduct : The department , school and university have very strict guidelines regarding academic misconduct . Obviously , copying is not allowed on exams . Students are expected to submit their own work on individual programming projects . Lending or borrowing all or part of a program from another student is not allowed . Students ARE allowed to borrow and modify any code on this class web site in their labs or programming projects . Instances of cheating will result in a loss on one letter grade in the course and referral to the department chairman and the dean of engineering . If a second case of academic misconduct is reported in any class , a dismissal hearing may be initiated by the dean of engineering . Topics Covered ( subject to change during the course ) : 1 . Measure , Ïƒ - algebra , random variables 2 . Law of large numbers 3 . Statistical decision theory , subjective Bayesian 4 . Maximum likelihood , Bayesian , Minimax 5 . Linear regression 6 . Linear classification 7 . Bayesian regression 8 . SVM 9 . Decision tree , Boosting , Boosted Decision Tree 10 . Gaussian processes 11 . EM 12 . Statistical Learning Theory 13 . Approximate inference in Bayesian 14 . Probabilistic graphical models 15 . Bayesian nonparametrics 16 . Big data 17 . Other topics related to Machine learning and data mining
