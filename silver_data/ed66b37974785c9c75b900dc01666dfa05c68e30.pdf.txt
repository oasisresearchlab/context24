Supplementary Note Re - evaluation of text mining tools used in DigSee DigSee used several state - of - the - art text mining tools to identify disease - gene relations . To confirm if the performance is consistent with the Medline abstracts relevant to our study , we re - evaluated TEES and the other text mining tools against 100 sample Medline abstracts of our experiments and found similar results as follows : A . Turku event extraction system DigSee utilizes the Turku event extraction system ( TEES ) 1 to locate biological events in Medline abstracts . It was reported to achieve a precision of 53 . 98 % , a recall of 52 . 69 % , and an F measure of 53 . 33 % at the EPI task in BioNLP - ST 2011 . 2 We tested TEES with randomly selected 100 Medline abstracts . In the sample abstracts , TEES extracted total 1177 event relations , 55 . 14 % of which were identified correct ( 679 relations ) in both named - entity recognition ( NER ) and event relation . Among the incorrect relations , 83 relations were attributed to the errors of ABNER . B . ABNER ABNER , 3 the NER tool for identifying gene and protein mentions , shows a precision of 77 . 93 % in sample Medline abstracts . The accuracy of ABNER was previously known to achieve an F - measure of 69 . 9 % in the previous study . 3 We also compared BANNER 4 and Gimli 5 with ABNER in the DigSee pipeline . In the validation results , from the 100 abstracts , ABNER and BANNER extracted 1 , 278 and 1 , 265 gene names with similar accuracies ( ABNER : a precision of 77 . 93 % and BANNER : a precision of 76 . 44 % ) . Although the precision of Gimli was higher as 82 . 57 % than the other two tools , it identifies the smaller number of genes names ( 1 , 033 ) . Based on these empirical results , we used ABNER as the NER tool . C . DNorm We use DNorm 6 for extracting disease mentions and normalizing diverse disease names into standard terms . In the results of sample Medline abstracts that randomly selected 100 abstracts , DNorm recognized 778 disease mentions , 76 . 34 % of which were identified correct in both NER and normalization . DNorm was known to achieve an F - measure of 80 . 9 % against a test set of the NCBI disease corpus in the previous study . 6 D . tmVar For locating mutation event , DigSee utilizes tmVar . 7 tmVar was reported to achieve an F - measure of 91 . 39 % ( a precision of 91 . 38 % and a recall of 91 . 40 % ) . tmVar achieved a precision of 99 . 58 % from randomly selected 100 sample Medline abstracts . In the sample abstracts , tmVar recognized total 726 mutation mentions . E . Moara Moara 8 is a flexible and trainable text mining system for gene / protein tagger and normalization . The system has been trained for several model organisms and corpora , moreover it can be expanded to support new organisms and documents . DigSee utilizes the Moara to normalize recognized gene mentions with human model , but not used to recognize gene and protein mentions . Moara achieved a precision of 55 . 00 % , a recall of 83 . 31 % , and an F - measure of 66 . 26 % in the previous study . 8 In the randomly selected 100 Medline abstracts , Moara achieved a precision of 75 . 10 % in the normalization step . A ranking method for evidence sentences To distinguish positive sentences supporting the triplet relationship of gene , disease , and biological event from negative sentences that do not describe the relationship , we previously developed a Bayesian model based on ten linguistically motivated features were constructed using the feature selection sentences 9 such as event and edge scores , gene - event distance , event - regulation distance , and event - disease distance , event depth , cancer keywords count , hallmark keywords count , negative score , and agent . These features were obtained from ABNER 3 and Turku event extraction system 1 , dependency parse trees generated by Stanford parser , hand - crafted disease - related terms , and terms related to negative sentences . Developed Bayesian classifier with the features was modeled to identify positive evidence sentences from negative sentences . By assigning the same prior to positive and negative evidence sentences , we calculated a likelihood ratio of features , L ( features ) = 𝑝𝑝 ( features | positive ) 𝑝𝑝 ( features | negative ) Basically , naïve Bayesian classifier assumes conditional independence among features . However , we empirically chose two types of dependencies , a dependency between cancer keyword and event - cancer distance and a dependency between agent and hallmark keywords count , after analyzing the feature selection data set . Therefore , the likelihood ratio can be rewritten as follows : 𝐿𝐿 ( features ) = � 𝑝𝑝 ( features 𝑖𝑖 | positive ) 𝑝𝑝 ( features 𝑖𝑖 | negative ) ⋅ 𝑝𝑝 ( cancer keywords count | positive , event - cancer distance ) 𝑝𝑝 ( cancer keywords count | negative , event - cancer distance ) features 𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝑝𝑝 ( agent | positive , hallmark keywords count ) 𝑝𝑝 ( agent | negative , hallmark keywords count ) Among the features , two features of “cancer keywords count” and “hallmark keywords count” were based on hand - crafted disease - related terms that means disease - dependent features . To adopt two features for all diseases , we develop a method of collecting disease - related terms using Word2Vec . 10 Word2Vec computes continuous vector representations of words based on neural networks , where the word vectors can be used for certain inference . At first , we computed the vectors of words using all sentences in disease - related Medline abstracts . The ten most similar words of each disease name in the vector space were selected as disease keywords . In addition , we identified hallmarks of a given disease ( e . g . , hypertension ) by contrasting them with known pairs of cancers and their hallmarks ( e . g . , proliferation ) . In particular , we used vector operations such as vector ( “cancer” ) − vector ( “proliferation” ) + vector ( “hypertension " ) to predict terms related to the given disease . For example , term “blood pressure” was found to be the top hallmark of hypertension using example vector operation . Additional methods for ranking disease - related gene ranking In addition to the five measures introduced in “Improving disease - related gene ranking” in the Method section , we augmented the fourth and fifth measures with biological events in order to see whether particular biological events might affect gene ranking and generated four additional ranking . First , for each disease , the ratios of biological events were calculated , and the summation and the average of normalized scores were multiplied by the event ratio ( 6 th and 7 th rankings ) . Second , for each gene , event ratios were calculated and the summation and the average of normalized scores were multiplied by the event ratio of genes ( 8 th and 9 th rankings ) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) .
