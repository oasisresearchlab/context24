Gaslini , 16148 Genova Quarto , Italy sing two - hybrid screening , we isolated the integrin cytoplasmic domain - associated protein ( ICAP - 1 ) , an interactor for the COOH terminal region of the (cid:2) 1A integrin cytoplasmic domain . To investigate the role of ICAP - 1 in integrin - mediated adhesive function , we expressed the full - length molecule in NIH3T3 cells . ICAP - 1 expression strongly prevents NIH3T3 cell spreading on extracellular matrix . This inhibition is transient and can be counteracted by coexpression of a constitutively activated mutant of Cdc42 , suggesting that ICAP - 1 acts upstream of this GTPase . In addition , we found that ICAP - 1 binds both to Cdc42 and U Rac1 in vitro , and its expression markedly inhibits activation of these GTPases during integrin - mediated cell adhesion to ﬁbronectin as detected by PAK binding assay . In the attempt to deﬁne the molecular mechanism of this inhibition , we show that ICAP - 1 reduces both the intrinsic and the exchange factor – induced dissociation of GDP from Cdc42 ; moreover , puriﬁed ICAP - 1 displaces this GTPase from cellular mem - branes . Together , these data show for the ﬁrst time that ICAP - 1 regulates Rho family GTPases during integrin - mediated cell matrix adhesion , acting as guanine dissociation inhibitor . Introduction Rho family GTPases are cytoplasmic proteins controlling several crucial cellular functions such as organization of the cytoskeleton in cell motility , gene expression , and cell cycle progression . Three of these GTPases , Cdc42 , Rac1 , and RhoA , have been studied in some detail and shown to play a major role in regulating actin cytoskeleton in response to soluble extracellular stimuli known to induce cell motility , such as PDGF and lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) * ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Hall , 1998 ) . In particular Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate the ability of the cell to elongate membrane protru - sions , such as filopodia and lamellipodia , whereas RhoA controls the organization of actin in stress fibers ( Hall , 1998 ) ending at “focal adhesions , ” sites of cell matrix con - tact where integrins are clustered . Filopodia , lamellipodia , and stress fibers are also formed during integrin - mediated cell adhesion to and spreading on insoluble extracellular matrix proteins in the absence of soluble motogenic factors . Integrins are major membrane receptors involved in cell matrix adhesion that generate a cascade of intracellular signals , leading to the organization of the actomyosin filaments ( Schoenwaelder and Burridge , 1999 ; Schwartz and Shattil , 2000 ) . Analysis of such signals indicated that integrins can trigger activation of Rho family GTPases ( Clark et al . , 1998 ; Price et al . , 1998 ; Olivo et al . , 2000 ) . In particular , it has been shown that integrins can activate p21PAK and ACK2 , two known effectors of Cdc42 and Rac1 , very shortly after binding to fibronectin ( Price et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Activation of these effectors is inhibited by expression of a dominant negative form of Cdc42 ( Price et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) , which also strongly inhibited cell spreading ( Clark et al . , 1998 ; Price et al . , 1998 ; Olivo et al . , 2000 ) . On the other hand , only modest effect on cell spreading was observed with Rac1 dominant negative mutants or by inhibiting RhoA with C3 exoenzyme ( Clark et al . , 1998 ; Price et al . , 1998 ; Olivo et al . , 2000 ) .

Key words : integrins ; Cdc42 ; Rac ; ICAP - 1 ; GDI ; cytoskeleton 378 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 2 , 2002 These data clearly indicate that activation of Cdc42 is crucial for integrin - mediated cell spreading on matrix proteins . How - ever , the molecular mechanisms leading to regulation of Cdc42 upon integrin binding to their ligands are still poorly defined . Activation of monomeric GTPases is determined by cy - cling between the GDP - and GTP - bound states . This pro - cess is controlled by three major classes of molecules known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) , and guanine nucleotide dissocia - tion inhibitors ( GDIs ) ( Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey , 1997 ) . GEFs induce the exchange of GDP for GTP , thus promoting the activation of the GTPases . Over 30 different GEFs have been described , all of which contain a Dbl ho - mology ( DH ) domain flanked at the COOH - terminal by a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( Hart et al . , 1994 ) . Al - though the DH domain is responsible for the GEF catalytic activity , the PH domain localizes the GEF protein to the plasma membrane where their GTPase substrates reside . Numerous GAPs have also been identified , which increase the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of the GTPase , thus promoting the transition to the inactive GDP - bound state . The third class of GTPase regulators is represented by the GDIs . Only a few of these proteins have been identified to date , and their structure has been solved recently . GDIs form a complex with GTPases sequestering these molecules in the cytoplasm and preventing their membrane association ( Leonard et al . , 1992 ) . The formation of this complex is me - diated by the COOH - terminal region of the GDI molecule , which forms a hydrophobic pocket accommodating the GTP - ase - bound isoprenyl lipid necessary for membrane localiza - tion , of the GTPase ( Gosser et al . , 1997 ; Keep et al . , 1997 ; Hoffman et al . , 2000 ; Scheffzek et al . , 2000 ) . The NH 2 - ter - minal region of the GDI molecule consists of a flexible arm capable of inhibiting GDP dissociation by binding to the switch I and II domains of the GTPase ( Keep et al . , 1997 ; Hoffman et al . , 2000 ; Scheffzek et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , activa - tion of a Rho family GTPase likely involves activation of GEFs and the simultaneous inhibition of GDIs and / or GAPs . Using the two - hybrid system , we identified a group of proteins capable of binding to the cytoplasmic domain of (cid:2) 1 - integrin ( Brancaccio et al . , 1999 ) . Among these , we iso - lated the integrin cytoplasmic domain associated protein ( ICAP - 1 ) , which was also isolated by other laboratories us - ing similar baits but different cDNA libraries ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Zhang and Hemler , 1999 ) . The data presented here show that overexpression of ICAP - 1 strongly reduces the in - tegrin - mediated cell spreading on extracellular matrix and inhibits both Cdc42 and Rac1 . In addition , ICAP - 1 induces release of Cdc42 from cellular membranes and prevents the dissociation of GDP from this GTPase . Thus , ICAP - 1 is a new GTPase regulatory protein endowed with GDI activity and involved in the integrin - mediated actin cytoskeleton regulation during cell matrix adhesion . Results Isolation of ICAP - 1 by two - hybrid screening and binding specificity To identify proteins able to interact with the (cid:2) 1 - integrin cy - toplasmic domain , we performed an interaction trap ap - proach ( Gyuris et al . , 1993 ) . Using the entire (cid:2) 1A cytoplas - mic region as a bait to screen a cDNA heart neonatal rat library , we isolated three different proteins ( Brancaccio et al . , 1999 ) . One of these proteins was found to be the inte - grin cytoplasmic domain - associated protein , ICAP - 1 , iso - lated recently also in other laboratories by screening of dif - ferent cDNA libraries ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Zhang and Hemler , 1999 ) . ICAP - 1 was found to specifically bind to (cid:2) 1 - integrin but not to (cid:2) 2 , (cid:2) 3 , and (cid:3) 5 . In addition , no binding was observed with the (cid:2) 1B and (cid:2) 1D isoforms , which differ from (cid:2) 1A in the COOH terminus of the pro - tein ( Balzac et al . , 1994 ; Belkin et al . , 1996 ; Table I ) . To map the amino acid sequences of (cid:2) 1 required for binding to ICAP - 1 , swapping mutants were generated between the (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D molecules and tested in the two - hybrid system . The results of these experiments indicate that , although im - portant , the NPXY sequences alone ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) are not sufficient for ICAP - 1 binding ( bait (cid:2) 1A / D / A in Table I ) . In fact , the six amino acid region AVTTVV ( 878 – 884 ) of (cid:2) 1A located between the two NPXY motives is required for ICAP - 1 binding ( bait (cid:2) 1D / A / D in Table I ) . ICAP - 1 inhibits the initial phase of cell spreading To test the possible function of ICAP - 1 , we transiently transfected this molecule in NIH3T3 cells . As detected with Table I .

Transfected cells were detached from the dish and replated on fibronectin - coated glass to test their ability to adhere and spread . As shown in Fig . 1 , cells expressing ICAP - 1 attach to fibronectin , but only 35 % (cid:6) 6 spread af - ter 60 min of plating on the coated substratum , whereas 84 % (cid:6) 4 of control untransfected cells present in the same sample spread under the same plating conditions . The inhi - bition of cell spreading by ICAP - 1 expression was not the re - sult of a toxic or non specific effect , since cells recover from inhibition and spread normally after overnight incubation Figure 1 .

This ICAP - 1 inhibitory effect was compara - ble to that observed on fibronectin ( Fig . 1 , A and B , com - pared with Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Taken together , these results suggest that in our experimental condition ICAP - 1 effect seems not to be dependent on integrin binding . ICAP - 1 inhibition of cell spreading is reversed by an activated form of Cdc42 Rho family GTPases regulate the actin organization required for cell adhesion and migration ( Nobes and Hall , 1999 ) . Previous work has shown that transient expression of a Cdc42 dominant negative mutant strongly inhibits cell spreading during adhesion on extracellular matrix ( Clark et al . , 1998 ; Price et al . , 1998 ; Olivo et al . , 2000 ) . The fact that expression of ICAP - 1 and a dominant negative form of Cdc42 induce a similar phenotype raises the possibility that the two proteins act on the same pathway . To test this hy - pothesis , we cotransfected ICAP - 1 with the constitutively activated form of Cdc42 , V12Cdc42 . As shown in Fig . 1 , ICAP - 1 induced only a modest inhibitions of cell spreading in cells transiently transfected with V12Cdc42 . Similar re - sults were observed in cells stably expressing V12Cdc42 ( Fig . 1 ) . In these cells , ICAP - 1 induced a 1 . 8 – 2 . 7 - fold de - crease of cell spreading , whereas in control cells it induced much strong response ( 4 - fold decrease ; Fig . 1 B ) . These re - sults suggest that Cdc42 acts downstream of ICAP - 1 during cell spreading on extracellular matrix . ICAP - 1 binds and inhibits Cdc42 and Rac1 Based on the results described above , we tested the possibil - ity that ICAP - 1 could regulate the activity of Rho family GTPases . To measure the activation state of Cdc42 and Rac1 , the GTP - bound form of these proteins was isolated using the CRIB domain of the effector protein PAK ( Sander et al . , 1998 ) . Cells transfected with control vector or ICAP - 1 were either maintained in suspension or plated on fibronec - tin , and cell extracts were processed as described in Materials and methods . COS cells were used in these experiments in order to achieve high level of expression . As shown in Fig . 3 A and Fig . 4 A , the amount of GTP - bound GTPases is in - creased upon cell adhesion to fibronectin , indicating that both Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated during cell spreading on fibronectin . However , expression of ICAP - 1 in these cells strongly reduced the level of GTP - bound form of both GTP - ases ( Fig . 3 and Fig . 4 , A and B ) . In the experimental condition used to analyze the activa - tion level of Cdc42 and Rac1 during cell spreading , we were not able to detect any significant activation of RhoA , as measured by pull - down assay with the Rho effector protein mDia ( Kimura et al . , 2000 ) , in accordance with previous re - ports ( Ren et al . , 1999 ; Arthur et al . , 2000 ) . Given that the adhesive stimulus was not sufficient to induce RhoA activa - tion , we then activated RhoA by either treating COS cells with LPA or transfecting them with pCEFL - GST - DH / PH coding for a GST fusion protein containing the DH / PH do - mains of the GEF protein Dbl . However , in both of these conditions ICAP - 1 expression did not affect RhoA activity ( unpublished data ; Fig . 5 A ) . To better understand the inhibitory action of ICAP - 1 on Cdc42 and Rac1 , we performed affinity chromatogra - Figure 2 . ICAP - 1 inhibition of cell spreading on vitronectin . ( A ) NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with myc – ICAP - 1 , detached with EDTA , and allowed to attach on vitronectin - coated coverslips ( 10 (cid:7) g / ml ) in serum - free medium for 1 h . Transfected cells were visualized by anti - myc monoclonal antibody , whereas actin organization was detected in the same sample with FITC phalloidin . ( B ) The percentage of spread cells was calculated as described in Materials and methods . Values are means (cid:6) SD from three independent experiments in which (cid:8) 20 cells per condition were scored . on fibronectin ( Fig . 1 A , b ) . Moreover , expression of a dif - ferent (cid:2) 1 integrin interactor , such as melusin ( Brancaccio et al . , 1999 ) , did not alter cell adhesion or spreading ( unpub - lished data ) . Interestingly , ICAP - 1 effect can be appreciated only when cells were detached and replated on fibronectin . In fact , transient transfection of cell monolayer or microinjection of adherent cells with ICAP - 1 constructs did not significantly alter the cell morphology ( unpublished data ) . These data show that inhibition of cell spreading by ICAP - 1 is specific and occurs only when cells are replated on fibronectin , sug - gesting a crucial role of ICAP - 1 during the initial phases of cell – matrix interaction . Given that ICAP - 1 binds to (cid:2) 1 A but not to (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 5 in - tegrin subunits ( unpublished data ; Chang et al . , 1997 ) , we wondered whether the ICAP - 1 antispreading effect was de - pendent on integrin (cid:2) 1 A binding . To this purpose , we ana - lyzed spreading of ICAP - 1 – expressing NIH3T3 cells on vi - tronectin , a substrate for (cid:3) V (cid:2) 3 and (cid:3) v (cid:2) 5 . As shown in Fig . 2 , ICAP - 1 – expressing cells spread poorly on vitronectin after ICAP - 1 regulates Rho family GTPases | Degani et al . 381 phy experiments to test the ability of these proteins to in - teract with each other . COS cell extracts were incubated with Sepharose coupled to purified MBP – ICAP - 1 fusion protein . As shown in Fig . 3 C and Fig . 4 C , Cdc42 and Rac1 bind to MBP – ICAP - 1 but not to MBP carrier pro - tein . On the other hand , affinity chromatography experi - ments showed that RhoA did not appreciably bind to Figure 3 . ICAP - 1 inhibits and binds Cdc42 . ( A ) COS cells transiently transfected with myc - Cdc42 together with control vector or myc – ICAP - 1 were suspended by trypsin treatment , kept in suspension 2 h 30 min in serum - free DME ( Su ) , and plated on fibronectin ( 5 (cid:7) g / ml ) for 1 h ( Ad ) . Cdc42 activity assay was performed as described in Materials and methods using a GST - PAK - CD fusion protein that selectively binds to GTP - Cdc42 . The bound GTP - Cdc42 was analyzed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody to Cdc42 . To probe for Cdc42 and ICAP - 1 expression , total cell lysates were blotted with the corre - sponding antibodies . ( B ) The amount of GTP - bound and total Cdc42 ( A , bottom band of the doublets ) was quantified by densitometric analysis , and the activa - tion level of Cdc42 was expressed as a ratio between the values of GTP - bound and total Cdc42 . Comparable results were obtained in three independent experiments . ( C ) Total protein extract of COS cells transfected with GST - Cdc42 was loaded on Sepharose coupled with MBP – ICAP - 1 fusion protein or MBP as control . The proteins eluted with glycine - HCl , pH 3 . 0 , buffer ( fractions numbers 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 ) were analyzed by Western blot - ting with polyclonal antibody against Cdc42 . Note that in A , Cdc42 is detected as a doublet of bands ; comparison of the electrophoretic mobility indicates that the bottom band of the doublet in A comigrates with the band in C . The top band of the doublet is likely to represent an incompletely processed form of the GTPase .

The columns were loaded with equal amounts of GST - Cdc42 fusion protein obtained from either the membrane fraction of pCEFL - GST - Cdc42 – transfected COS cells ( a ) , the cytoplasmic fraction of the same cells ( b ) , or bacterial lysate of E . coli producing the GST - Cdc42 fusion protein ( c ) . The amount of fusion proteins loaded on the column are shown on the left as control for equal loading . Figure 4 . ICAP - 1 inhibits and binds Rac1 .

Rac1 activation level was evaluated as described in Materials and methods using a GST - PAK - CD fusion protein that selectively binds to GTP - Rac1 . The bound GTP - Rac1 was analyzed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody to Rac1 . To probe for Rac1 and ICAP - 1 expression , total cell lysates were blotted with the corresponding antibodies . ( B ) The amount of GTP - bound and total Rac1 ( A ) was quantified by densito - metric analysis ; the activation level of Rac1 is expressed as a ratio between the values of GTP - bound and total Rac1 .

Moreover , we tested the bind - ing of transfected molecules unrelated to GTPases , such as melusin ( Brancaccio et al . , 1999 ) , or endogenous COS proteins such as p125Fak and paxillin . None of these proteins bind to ICAP - 1 ( unpublished data ) , demonstrat - ing the specificity of the interaction with Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases . Rho family GTPases are posttranslationally modified in eukaryotic cells by covalent binding of an isoprenyl chain that allows association with cellular membranes to exert Figure 5 . ICAP - 1 does neither inhibit nor bind RhoA . ( A ) RhoA activity assay was performed as described in Materials and methods using COS cells either untrans - fected or transfected as indicated .

The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against RhoA .

Inhibitory effect of ICAP - 1 on the dissociation of [ (cid:3) - 32 P ] GDP from Cdc42 . GST - Cdc42 was expressed in COS cells , and the protein was purified from the membranous fraction and captured on glutathione - Sepharose . The Cdc42 immobilized on the beads was loaded with guanosine nucleotide by incubation with [ (cid:3) - 32 P ] GTP 25 min at room temperature . The dissociation of the GDP induced by chelating Mg 2 (cid:4) with EDTA ( A ) or by the GEF activ - ity of Dbl ( B ) was measured in the presence of either the buffer alone , MBP – ICAP - 1 ( 10 (cid:7) g ) , or the same amount of GST - Rho GDI fusion proteins after 10 min at room temperature . ( C ) Time course for [ (cid:3) - 32 P ] GDP dissociation from Cdc42 induced by chelating Mg 2 (cid:4) with EDTA in the presence of either 10 (cid:7) g of MBP – ICAP - 1 , GST - Rho GDI , MBP carrier protein , or buffer alone . Results shown are means (cid:6) SD of values from three experiments . [ (cid:3) - 32 P ] GDP remaining is expressed as the percentage of [ (cid:3) - 32 P ] GDP bound to Cdc42 after loading . ICAP - 1 regulates Rho family GTPases | Degani et al . 383 their biological activity . To test whether this modification affects binding to ICAP - 1 , Cdc42 - containing extracts were prepared from membrane and cytosol fractions of COS and prokaryotic cells . Maximal binding was observed for Cdc42 extracted from the membrane fraction , whereas binding of Cdc42 from prokaryotic cells was eightfold less efficient , suggesting that isoprenylation is important for this interac - tion ( Fig . 3 D ) . In addition , the reduced binding of cytosolic Cdc42 to ICAP - 1 compared with the membrane Cdc42 fraction is likely due to a preferential binding of cytoplasmic Cdc42 to endogenous Rho - GDI . In addition we found that ICAP - 1 binds with similar inten - sity to the GTP or GDP form of Cdc42 ( unpublished data ) . ICAP - 1 inhibits GDP dissociation GAPs and GDIs are important negative regulators of mono - meric GTPases . Comparative sequence analysis indicated a partial degree of homology between ICAP - 1 and known GDI molecules ( see Fig . 8 and Discussion ) . To test whether ICAP - 1 can exert GDI activity , Cdc42 was expressed in COS cells as a GST fusion protein , and the membrane - bound frac - tion was affinity purified . After loading of Cdc42 with radio - active GTP , the release of the nucleotide induced either by chelating Mg 2 (cid:4) ions or by the Dbl GEF was measured in the presence of purified ICAP - 1 , unrelated molecule , such as the carrier protein MBP , or a known GDI such as RhoGDI . As shown in Fig . 6 , ICAP - 1 inhibits the dissociation of GDP in - duced either by EDTA ( see Fig . 6 A ) or by Dbl GEF ( see Fig . 6 B ) . MBP control protein does not alter the release of GDP with respect to buffer control ( see Fig . 6 C ) . A known activity of GDIs is their ability to induce the re - lease of the GTPase from cellular membranes ( Leonard et al . , 1992 ) . To test for this activity , membrane fractions from COS cells transfected with Cdc42 constructs were incubated with purified MBP – ICAP - 1 fusion protein or MBP alone . As shown in Fig . 7 , increasing amounts of purified ICAP - 1 caused an increasing level of Cdc42 to be released into a sol - uble supernatant fraction . The result demonstrates that ICAP - 1 , besides being able to inhibit GDP dissociation , is also able to specifically elicit the release of Cdc42 from the membrane . Discussion Here we report that ICAP - 1 , a protein which binds to the (cid:2) 1 integrin cytoplasmic domain , inhibits cell spreading on extracellular matrix substratum by interfering with Cdc42 and Rac1 activation . Hemler and coworkers have shown that ICAP - 1 can pro - mote (cid:2) 1 - integrin – dependent cell migration ( Zhang and Hemler , 1999 ) . These authors have not analyzed the effect of ICAP - 1 on cell spreading on extracellular matrix proteins , but their observation is consistent with our finding that ICAP - 1 reduces cell spreading . Based on tests detecting effector protein activation , such as p21PAK and ACK2 , it has been proposed that cell matrix adhesion causes rapid and transient activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Price et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . On the other hand , during the initial phase of cell spreading RhoA activity is not increased ( Ren et al . , 1999 ) and might be even inhib - ited via a src - p190RhoGAP pathway ( Arthur et al . , 2000 ) . Although Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate actin polymerization and assembly of protrusive membrane structures , such as filopodia and lamellipodia , necessary for cell spreading and locomotion on the substratum , RhoA is known to promote actin filament assembly in stress fibers and to increase the contractile forces exerted by the actomyosin filaments ( Schoenwaelder and Burridge , 1999 ) . Thus , it has been pro - posed that inhibition of RhoA during initial phases of cell spreading is necessary to prevent contractile forces that would interfere with the highly dynamic actin - based activity occurring at membrane protrusions during cell adhesion or migration . Here , by directly measuring GTP - bound forms we show that adhesion to fibronectin induces activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 . Moreover , we report that ICAP - 1 binds to both Cdc42 and Rac1 and prevents their activation along with cell spreading . Interestingly , RhoA binds very poorly to ICAP - 1 and is not significantly activated during cell adhe - sion to fibronectin under the experimental conditions used . In addition , the activation state of RhoA triggered by the GEF protein Dbl or LPA treatment is not affected by ICAP - 1 expression . Together , these data suggest that ICAP - 1 acts as specific regulator of Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases during the initial phases of cell spreading on extracellular matrix pro - tein . Rho family GTPases are covalently modified by isopreny - lation that is required for their translocation from the cyto - sol to the cellular membrane where they perform their func - tion ( Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey , 1997 ) . On the other hand , through their isoprenoid moiety these GTPases can interact with GDI molecules that keep them in an inactive Figure 7 . ICAP - 1 stimulated release of Cdc42 from the membranes of COS cells . Membranes from COS cells transfected with myc - Cdc42 were prepared as described in Materials and methods . The mem - branes were incubated with the indicated amounts of purified MBP – ICAP - 1 or MBP alone as a control for 25 min at room temperature . After centrifugation , the supernatant fractions were examined for the presence of Cdc42 using SDS - PAGE and Western blotting with a specific antibody ( A ) . The relative amount of Cdc42 released into supernatant fraction was determined by densitometric scanning analysis ( B ) . 384 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 2 , 2002 cytoplasmic pool ( Regazzi et al . , 1992 ) . Interestingly , we found that addition of purified ICAP - 1 to a membrane frac - tion induces the release of membrane - bound Cdc42 and that ICAP - 1 is able to reduce the release of the guanine nu - cleotide from Cdc42 in the presence of a known exchange factor such as Dbl . In addition , ICAP - 1 was found to bind more strongly to Cdc42 isolated from the membrane frac - tion than to cytosolic Cdc42 or Cdc42 synthesized in prokaryotic cells where the GTPases cannot be isopreny - lated . These properties support the idea that ICAP - 1 exert a GDI activity . In our assay conditions , this activity was lower than that of RhoGDI , suggesting that ICAP - 1 has distinct and unique properties from a previously characterized GDI . We can hypothesize that ICAP - 1 acts only on the limited pool of Cdc42 and Rac1 involved in the turnover of new contact sites , spatially restricted to filopodia and lamellipo - dia during spreading or migration processes , whereas the re - maining pool of Cdc42 could be regulated by other GDI molecules such as RhoGDI . Interestingly , comparative sequence analysis indicated an overall homology of 27 % between ICAP - 1 and RhoGDI ( Fig . 8 ) and several other members of the GDI family ( un - published data ) . The homology was particularly striking ( 34 % ) in the COOH terminal region spanning from resi - dues 80 to 200 . As shown by Hoffman et al . ( 2000 ) , this re - gion of RhoGDI consists of an immunoglobulin - like do - main that binds to the isoprenyl moiety of the GTPase . More interestingly , 60 % of the RhoGDI residues shown to be crucial for this interaction ( Fig . 8 , gray shaded residues ) are conserved in the corresponding region of ICAP - 1 . More - over , the predicted secondary structure of this region of ICAP - 1 is significantly similar to the one determined by crystallography for the RhoGDI as shown in Fig . 8 ( Hoff - man et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , these structural homologies are consistent with the ability of ICAP - 1 to bind Cdc42 and re - lease it from the membrane . In addition , the amino acid res - idues 45 and 47 in RhoGDI ( Fig . 8 ) crucial for the GDI ac - tivity and conserved in several GDI molecules are also conserved in ICAP - 1 ( Fig . 8 ) . At present , we do not know whether ICAP - 1 has a GDI activity on Rac1 , and we cannot definitively conclude whether the inhibition of Rac1 observed with the pull - down PAK assay is due to a direct GDI activity on this GTPase . It is also possible that Rac1 is inhibited as a consequence of Cdc42 inhibition by ICAP - 1 . It has been proposed that these GTPases can act in cascade , Cdc42 being able to acti - vate Rac1 ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . However , the ability of ICAP - 1 to bind Rac1 suggests that ICAP - 1 should directly affect Rac1 activity . Further studies are necessary to precisely define the detailed mechanisms of ICAP - 1 function on Rac . Previous work has shown that integrins can regulate GEF function . GEFs are proteins capable of stimulating the ex - change of GDP with GTP , thus increasing the active GTP - bound form of the GTPases . In particular , two GEF mole - cules , Vav1 and cytohesin1 , can be regulated in response to cell matrix adhesion . Vav1 is an exchange factor for Rac1 that can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation ( Crespo et al . , 1997 ) . Indeed , integrin - mediated cell adhesion was shown to induce Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation in different cell types ( Cichowski et al . , 1996 ; Gotoh et al . , 1997 ; Miranti et al . , 1998 ; Yron et al . , 1999 ) . Cytohesin1 is a GEF for ARF , a GTPase known to be involved in the regulation of vesicle traffic in the secretory / endocytic pathway . Recent results have shown that cytohesin1 is crucial in regulating integrin affinity state for the extracellular ligand , a process known as inside / out signaling ( Geiger et al . , 2000 ) . Both Vav1 and cytohesin1 are expressed preferentially in he - mopoietic cell lineages and are likely to play a major role in this system . Another GEF protein that is likely to play a role in integrin - mediated activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 is PIX ( Turner et al . , 1999 ) . This protein is part of a large complex that includes PAK , NCK , p95PKL , and paxillin . The im - portant role played by paxillin in cell adhesion , and the lo - calization of this complex at focal adhesions ( Turner et al . , 1999 ) strongly argues for an important role of PIX as a downstream effector in integrin - mediated actin cytoskeleton organization . The existence of a GDI protein , like ICAP - 1 , in the path - way of integrin signaling suggests that during cell matrix ad - hesion not only GEF should be activated in order to increase the GTP - bound form of the GTPases , but the inhibitory ac - tion of the GDI molecule should be released . A hypothetical Figure 8 . Sequence alignment of bovine RhoGDI ( RhoGDIBt ) and ICAP - 1 proteins .

ICAP - 1 regulates Rho family GTPases | Degani et al . 385 model can be envisaged in which in cells detached from the matrix , ICAP - 1 forms an inhibitory complex with Cdc42 by displacing it from the plasma membrane and preventing the exchange of the GDP for the GTP . Upon interaction with extracellular matrix , ICAP - 1 is modified to neutralize its GDI activity . Indeed , it has been shown that ICAP - 1 is phosphorylated upon integrin - mediated cell adhesion to fi - bronectin ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Zhang and Hemler , 1999 ) , and it can thus be postulated that this event affects the GDI activity of the protein . In the experimental system used here , ICAP - 1 levels are increased several fold over the basal level in consequence of transfection , and thus its inhibition of the Rho family GTPases persists for longer times , causing the delay in cell spreading . The functional significance of ICAP - 1 binding to the (cid:2) 1 - integrin cytoplasmic domain is still to be defined . It is possible that ICAP - 1 binds to the in - tegrin cytoplasmic domain to perform other functions such as regulation of integrin affinity as proposed by Block and coworkers ( Bouvard and Block , 1998 ) . Indeed , we did not observe any difference in ICAP - 1 effect on cell spreading us - ing two distinct extracellular matrix substrates , such as fi - bronectin and vitronectin , suggesting that the potential (cid:2) 1 A integrin - mediated control of ICAP - 1 function was overcome due to ICAP - 1 overexpression levels . However , overexpres - sion approach led us to bring to light the important function of ICAP - 1 as a GDI molecule . Furthermore , ICAP - 1 specifically binds to the (cid:2) 1A iso - form in the COOH terminal region known to differ among the splicing isoforms ( Balzac et al . , 1994 ; Fornaro et al . , 1995 ; Belkin et al . , 1996 ) . Binding involves the more COOH terminal NPXY motive present in (cid:2) 1A integrin cy - toplasmic domain ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) and residues imme - diately upstream ( Table I ) . Interestingly , two isoforms of the (cid:2) 1 integrin , (cid:2) 1B and (cid:2) 1D , that do not bind ICAP - 1 are in - competent to support cell spreading and cell migration on fibronectin ( Balzac et al . , 1994 ; Belkin et al . , 1997 ) . These properties are consistent with the hypothesis that binding of ICAP - 1 to (cid:2) 1 integrin is required to release the inhibitory effect of this protein on Cdc42 and Rac1 , thus promoting cell spreading and migration . However , further work is nec - essary to test this hypothesis . In conclusion , the data reported here show that ICAP - 1 , a protein isolated as an interactor of the (cid:2) 1 - integrin cytoplas - mic domain , binds and negatively regulates Cdc42 and Rac1 , acting as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor . Thus , this protein is a new element , potentially connecting integrin - mediated cell matrix adhesion with regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Materials and methods Interaction trap Screening for proteins that interact with cytoplasmic tails of (cid:2) 1A was per - formed as described ( Gyuris et al . , 1993 ) . To construct the bait plasmid , DNA sequence encoding amino acids 752 – 798 of (cid:2) 1A was amplified by PCR using primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sites on either ends ( (cid:2) 1A , 5 (cid:9) - GGAATTCAAGCTTTTAATGA4TAATT - 3 (cid:9) and 5 (cid:9) - CGGGATCCT - CATTTTCCCTCATACTT - 3 (cid:9) ) and cloned in pEG 202 vector in frame with LexA coding sequence . This plasmid was unable to activate transcription when cotransformed in EGY48 yeast strain with pSH 18 – 34 reporter plas - mid . The expression of this fusion protein in yeast total protein extracts was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti - LexA antibody ( a gift from A . Zervos , University of Central Florida , Orlando , FL ) . A cDNA li - brary from heart neonatal rat fused to a galactose - inducible activation do - main ( a gift from A . Zervos ) was transformed in yeast strain EGY48 that al - ready contained pSH 18 – 34 reporter plasmid and pEG202 - (cid:2) 1A using a LiAc high efficiency transformation protocol ( Gietz et al . , 1992 ) . Primary transformants ( 2 (cid:10) 10 6 ) were screened by plating 10 7 colonies on select - able medium lacking Ura , His , Trp , and Leu . Several positive clones were isolated , and their specific binding to integrins was tested by assaying the interaction with control baits such as bicoid , bFGF , cyclin A , and c - Myc ( a gift from A . Zervos ) . Other baits were produced to test the ability of ICAP - 1 to interact with other integrin cytoplasmic tails . These baits were prepared by PCR amplifi - cation using the following primers : ( 5 (cid:9) - catgccatggaaggctctgatccacctg - 3 (cid:9) and 5 (cid:9) ccgctcgagctaactctcagcaaactt - 3 (cid:9) ) coding for amino acid residues 724 – 769 of (cid:2) 2 ; ( 5 (cid:9) - gcatgccatggaaactcctcatcaccatc - 3 (cid:9) and 5 (cid:9) - ccgctcgagttaagtgccccg - gtacgt - 3 (cid:9) ) coding for amino acid residues 716 – 762 of human (cid:2) 3 ; ( 5 (cid:9) - ggaat - tcaagcttttaatgataatt - 3 (cid:9) and 5 (cid:9) - cgggatccttataagccactttgctt - 3 (cid:9) ) coding for amino acid residues 752 – 789 of (cid:2) 1B ; ( 5 (cid:9) - ggaattcaagcttttaatgataatt - 3 (cid:9) and 5 (cid:9) - cgggatcctcagagaccagctttacg - 3 (cid:9) ) coding for amino acid residues 752 – 801 of (cid:2) 1D ; and ( 5 (cid:9) - ggaattcaagcttggattcttcaaa - 3 (cid:9) and 5 (cid:9) - cgggatcctcaggcatcagag - gtggc - 3 (cid:9) ) coding for amino acid residues 1022 – 1049 of (cid:3) 5 . To map the ICAP - 1 binding site in (cid:2) 1A , four swapping mutant con - structs of (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D cytoplasmic regions were generated by PCR ampli - fication and cloned in frame with LexA sequence in pEG 202 . The follow - ing mutants were generated : (cid:2) 1A / D ( A778 – 795 / D796 – 801 ) , (cid:2) 1D / A ( D778 – 795 / A796 – 798 ) , (cid:2) 1A / D / A ( A778 – 785 / D786 – 791 / A792 – 798 ) , and (cid:2) 1D / A / D ( D778 – 785 / A786 – 791 / D792 – 801 ) . Numbers indicate the amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic region of (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D ( Table I ) . Constructs and antibodies Positive clones selected with the two - hybrid screening were sequenced us - ing ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit ( PerkinElmer ) . A10 - 1 cDNA fragment contained the sequence of ICAP - 1 lacking a 5 (cid:9) fragment coding for the first 12 amino acids of the protein . The full length of ICAP - 1 was constructed by PCR amplification . A10 . 1 clone was used as template and annealed to a synthetic oligonucleotide coding for the first 12 missing amino acids of the protein . The coding sequence was obtained from the mouse ICAP - 1 cDNA ( Faisst and Gruss , 1998 ) . A second cycle of PCR amplification was made to introduce a myc tag and KpnI restriction site . The PCR products were digested with KpnI and XhoI and inserted into pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector . To produce large amounts of soluble protein , the full - length ICAP - 1 was fused to maltose binding protein for expression in prokaryotic cells . Using pcDNA3 - myc – ICAP - 1 as template , EcoRI restriction enzyme site was in - troduced by PCR amplification in ICAP - 1 full - length cDNA . The fragment was cloned into the EcoRI / XbaI sites of pMAL - p2 vector . All constructs were sequenced using ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit . The following prokaryotic expression constructs were used to express GST fusion proteins : pGEX PAK - CD , encoding the PAK - CRIB , was pro - vided by J . Collard ( Netherland Cancer Institute , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) ( Sander et al . , 1998 ) . pGEX RhoGDI was provided by Y . Zheng ( University of Tennessee , Memphis , TN ) ( Leonard et al . , 1992 ) . pGEX - Cdc42 was pro - vided by R . Cerione ( Cornell University , Ithaca , NY ) . PGEX - mDIA was pro - vided by S . Narumiya ( Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan ) . To express GST fusion proteins in eukaryotic cells , Cdc42Hs cDNA and cDNA coding for Dbl DH / PH domains ( residues 497 – 875 ) were cloned into the BamHI site of the pCEFL - GST vector provided by S . Gutkind ( Na - tional Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . pcEXV - myc - V12Cdc42 , pRK5 - myc - Cdc42 , and pRK5 - mycRac1 con - structs , a gift from A . Hall ( University College of London , London , UK ) , were used for transient expression in NIH3T3 and COS cells . Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against ICAP - 1 was prepared by immuniz - ing a rabbit with MBP – ICAP - 1 fusion protein . Antibodies against Cdc42 and RhoA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . 9E10 anti - myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Anti - Rac1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology . Cell cultures and transfection COS cells cultured in DME supplemented with 10 % FCS were transiently transfected at 80 % confluence by the DEAE - dextran method ( Kluxen and Lubbert , 1993 ) and used for experiments 48 h after DNA addition . NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in DME supplemented with 10 % calf serum . For Immunofluorescence experiments , cells were plated at a den - sity of 12 (cid:10) 10 4 into 6 - well culture plates and transfected with 10 (cid:7) g of 386 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 2 , 2002 plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate procedure ( Chen and Okayama , 1987 ) . In cotransfection experiments , the various DNA con - structs were used at a 1 : 1 ratio . Cells were used for experiments 36 h after DNA addition . To obtain stable expression of V12Cdc42 , NIH3T3 were transfected with pZipNeo - V12Cdc42 by the calcium phosphate procedure and grown for 3 wk in the presence of 375 (cid:7) g / ml G418 as described ( Olivo et al . , 2000 ) . Immunofluorescence analysis Transiently transfected cells were detached gently with 5 mM EDTA in PBS , washed with PBS containing 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and plated in serum - free DME for 1 h onto fibronectin - coated coverslips . Cells were fixed in 3 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / TBS ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 min . F - actin was revealed by staining with fluorescein - FITC - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Transiently transfected cells were revealed with anti - myc mono - clonal antibody 9E10 . Cells were observed and counted under an Olym - pus fluorescence microscope , and pictures were taken with an Olympus DP10 digital photomicrography system . To evaluate the degree of cell spreading , the cell area was measured by a computerized image analysis system . Cells with an area (cid:8) 150 (cid:7) m 2 were considered spread . Rho GTPases activity assays The assay described by Sander et al . ( 1998 ) based on the interaction of the GTP - bound GTPase to the PAK CRIB domain was used . To prepare the GST - PAK CRIB domain fusion protein , Escherichia coli TOPF 1 10 cells transformed with the GST - PAK - CD construct were harvested and resus - pended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Hcl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 100 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM DTT , 10 (cid:7) g / ml leupeptin , 0 . 4 (cid:7) g / ml pepstatin , 0 . 1 TIU / ml aprotinin , 1 mM PMSF ) and sonicated . Af - ter centrifugation , the cell lysate supernatant was incubated with glu - tathione - coupled Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) for 30 min at 4 (cid:11) C . The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer , and the amount of bound fusion protein was estimated after separation by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . COS cells transiently transfected with the indicated constructs were de - tached with trypsin - EDTA ( 0 . 05 % trypsin , 0 . 02 % EDTA in PBS ) , washed twice with serum - free DME , and maintained in suspension for 2 h 30 min at 4 (cid:11) C in serum free DME before plating on coated dishes . 1 h after seed - ing , the cells were washed in ice - cold PBS , incubated 5 min on ice in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 10 % glyc - erol , 1 % NP - 40 , 10 (cid:7) g / ml leupeptin , 0 . 4 (cid:7) g / ml pepstatin , 0 . 1 TIU / ml apro - tinin , 1 mM PMSF ) , and then centrifuged for 5 min at 4 (cid:11) C at 16 , 000 g . Ali - quots were taken from the supernatant to compare protein amounts . The supernatant was incubated with GST - PAK - CD bound to glutathione – Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) at 4 (cid:11) C for 30 min . The beads were washed three times with an excess of lysis buffer , and bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed for the pres - ence of Cdc42 or Rac1 molecules by Western blotting using antibodies specific for Cdc42 and Rac . Rho activation state was assessed by using GST - mDIA fusion protein to pull down GTP - loaded RhoA accordingly with Kimura et al . ( 2000 ) . Affinity chromatography To prepare the affinity matrix , ICAP - 1 was expressed as a MBP fusion pro - tein and purified from E . coli by affinity chromatography on amilose resin ( Biolabs ) . 5 mg of purified MBP – ICAP - 1 or MBP alone as control were dia - lyzed overnight at 4 (cid:11) C in coupling buffer ( 0 . 1 M NaHCO 3 / Na 2 CO 3 , pH 9 . 2 ) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 430 mg of dried CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Cdc42 - containing cell extracts were prepared by expressing the GST – Cdc42 fusion protein in E . coli and in COS cells using pGEX - Cdc42 and pCEFL - GST - Cdc42 constructs , respectively . Transfected COS cells were lysed with 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 10 (cid:7) g / ml leupeptin , 4 (cid:7) g / ml pepstatin , 0 . 1 TIU / ml aprotinin , and 1 mM PMSF . After centrifugation at 10 , 000 g , total soluble proteins were chromatographed on MBP – ICAP - 1 Sepharose . After washing with five volumes of TBS , the proteins were eluted with 0 . 1 M glycine - HCl , pH 3 . The collected fractions ( 500 (cid:7) l each ) were neutralized by titra - tion with 1 . 5 M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 8 , lyophilized , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit antibody against Cdc42 . To compare the binding capacity to ICAP - 1 of the membrane - bound cy - tosolic or E . coli produced Cdc42 extracts from cytoplasmic and mem - brane fractions of COS cells ( see below for membrane fraction prepara - tion ) or bacterial lysates were loaded on the MBP – ICAP - 1 Sepharose column . Columns were loaded with equal amounts of Cdc42 as deter - mined by Western blotting . To test if the binding activity of the GTPases to ICAP - 1 was affected by the nature of the bound guanine nucleotide , the procedure described by Hart et al . ( 1994 ) was followed . To test ICAP - 1 binding to Rac1 and RhoA , total extracts of COS cells were used in the affinity chromatography procedure described above , and the eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with specific mono - clonal antibodies . Assay of GDP dissociation from Cdc42 The release of GDP from Cdc42 was measured as described ( Leonard et al . , 1992 ) . To purify the isoprenylated form of Cdc42 , a construct encoding for the GST - Cdc42 fusion protein ( pCEFL - GST - Cdc42 ) was transfected in COS cells . 48 h after transfection , 4 (cid:10) 10 7 cells were trypsinized , washed with PBS , and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 TIU aprotinin , 10 (cid:7) g / ml leupeptin , 4 (cid:7) g / ml pepstatin ) with 20 strokes of a 7 - ml glass / glass Dounce homoge - nizer . Homogenates were centrifuged at 10 , 0000 g for 1 h , the cytosol - containing supernatant was removed , and the crude membrane pellet was solubilized with TBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 (cid:7) g / ml leupeptin , 4 (cid:7) g / ml pepstatin , 0 . 1 TIU / ml aprotinin , and 1 mM PMSF for 90 min at 4 (cid:11) C and then clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 0000 g for 1 h . The solubilized membrane fraction was incubated with glutathione - coupled Sepharose beads at 4 (cid:11) C for 30 min . The beads were then washed three times with PBS , and the amount of bound fusion protein was estimated using Coo - massie - stained SDS gels . To load Cdc42 with a radiolabeled nucleotide , the beads were first in - cubated with 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 100 (cid:7) M AMP - PNP , 100 (cid:7) M DTT , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 7 (cid:7) M [ (cid:3) - 32 P ] GTP for 25 min at room temperature and washed extensively in the same buffer to remove un - bound radiolabeled nucleotide . Aliquots ( 5 (cid:7) l ) of guanine nucleotide – loaded Cdc42 bound to the beads ( typically 200 – 300 ng in 5 (cid:7) l ) were in - cubated with 20 (cid:7) l of 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , and 2 mM MgCl 2 , containing purified proteins ( MBP , MBP – ICAP - 1 , GST - RhoGDI , GST - Dbl / DH - PH ) , or the buffer alone and were allowed to incu - bate for an additional 10 min at room temperature . To induce the release of the GDP , 32 (cid:7) l of GDI buffer ( 55 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 45 mM NaCl , 1 mM AMP - PNP , 100 (cid:7) M DTT , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM GDP , 0 . 55 mg / ml BSA ) were added to each sample . After the indicated time of incubation at room temperature , the reaction was stopped by diluting the samples in 1 . 8 ml of ice - cold buffer containing 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 100 mM NaCl , and 10 mM MgCl 2 , washed three times with the same buffer , and analyzed in the (cid:2) counter . When the dissociation of the GDP was measured in the pres - ence of 100 ng of the GEF GST - Dbl , the assays were performed essentially as outlined above except that EDTA was omitted and 2 mM MgCl 2 was added to the GDI buffer . RhoGDI was expressed as a GST fusion protein from pGEX vector and purified from E . coli using glutathione – Sepharose 4B column . GST - Dbl ( DH - PH domain ) was transfected in COS cells and purified using glu - tathione – Sepharose 4B column . Release of Cdc42 protein from COS cell membranes Adherent COS cells were transfected with pRK5 - myc - Cdc42 construct as described above . Transfected cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed in 10 ml hypotonic buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 6 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 TIU aprotinin , 10 (cid:7) g / ml leupep - tin , 4 (cid:7) g / ml pepstatin , and lysed with 10 strokes of a 7 - ml glass / glass Dounce homogenizer . The nuclei and any unbroken cells were removed from the sample by centrifugation at 1 , 000 g for 12 min . The supernatant was centrifuged at 27 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:11) C to pellet the particulate frac - tion . After removal of the supernatant , the membranes were washed twice in hypotonic buffer , resuspended in 1 . 5 ml of 20 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , pH 8 , and aliquoted for long - term storage at – 80 (cid:11) C . A 10 - (cid:7) l aliquot of membrane fraction was mixed with 8 (cid:7) l of reaction buffer ( 100 mM Tris - HCl , 250 mM NaCl , 25 mM MgCl 2 , pH 8 ) and 22 (cid:7) l of distilled H 2 O containing increasing amounts of purified MBP – ICAP - 1 or MBP as negative control . This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 25 min and then centrifuged at 27 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:11) C to separate the membranes from the soluble fraction . The supernatant and the pellet were then analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit antibody against Cdc42 . The relative amount of Cdc42 was deter - mined by densitometric scanning analysis . We are indebted to A . Zervos , J . Collard , Y . Zheng , R . Cerione , S . Gutkind , S . Narumiya , and A .
