Introduction The protozoan pathogens Trypanosoma brucei , Trypanosoma cru - zi , Leishmania major , Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania infan - tum are parasites that produce devastating human diseases [ 1 – 3 ] . Different species of trypanosomes infect a variety of vertebrates , including animals and humans , and most species are transmitted by insects ( http : / / www . who . int / trypanosomiasis _ african / parasite / en / index . html ) . Human African trypanosomiasis , or sleeping sickness , only oc - curs in Sub - Saharan Africa . It is caused by T . brucei . Sleeping sick - ness threatens millions of people in 36 countries . The most important pathogenic trypanosome in Central and South America is T . cruzi , the etiologic agent of Chagas’ disease , a major health problem with estimates of infected people ranging from 8 to 15 million . The actual magnitude of the disease , however , is rather uncertain and is geographically heterogeneous [ 4 , 5 ] . The leishmaniases are caused by 20 species pathogenic for hu - mans belonging to Leishmania spp . , including Leishmania ( Leish - mania ) major , L . ( L . ) infantum and L . ( Viannia ) braziliensis . These parasites cause several different forms of leishmaniasis , represent - ing a major burden in developing countries . For many years , the public health impact of leishmaniases has been grossly underesti - mated , primarily due to lack of awareness of its serious impact on health . Over the last 10 years , endemic regions have been spread - ing , and there has been a sharp increase in the number of recorded cases of the disease . As declaration is compulsory in only 32 of the 88 countries affected by leishmaniasis , a substantial number of cases are never recorded . In fact , 2 million new cases ( 1 . 5 million for CL and 500 , 000 for VL ) are thought to occur annually , with an estimated 12 million people presently infected worldwide ( http : / / www . who . int / leishmaniasis / burden / magnitude / burden _ magnitude / en / index . html ) . Undoubtedly , the elucidation of the complete genomic se - quence , as well as gene surveys and comparative studies of trypan - osomatid genomes have been a landmark in our knowledge of the biology of these pathogens [ 6 – 16 ] . The trypanosomatid - speciﬁc metabolic pathways revealed by comparative analysis currently serve as a basis for focused biochemical analyses to identify valid drug targets for development . In - depth functional analyses may ultimately unravel the relative contribution of parasite genes to disease progression in this spectrum of crippling infections [ 10 ] . The phosphatidylinositol kinase ( PIK ) pathway is currently one of the most popular targets for the development of new cancer treatments . Therefore , several pharmaceutical companies regard the components of this pathway as highly relevant for the design 0006 - 291X / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2009 Elsevier Inc .

A great deal of effort has been devoted to the development of subtype - speciﬁc inhibitors that can target isolated signal transduction systems with a view to providing therapeutic beneﬁt whilst minimizing side effects [ 17 – 20 ] . For example , PI3K and PKB ( protein kinase B , AKT / PKB ) are attractive targets for cancer therapy because they lie at the heart of a key oncogenic pathway at the point where it diverges and integrates with signals from other important cellular pathways Fig . 1 .

Bahia et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 963 – 970 [ 21 , 22 ] . PI3K or AKT / PKB inhibitors may thus potentially inhibit this pathway more effectively and be relatively less susceptible to feedback loops when compared to the targeting of single branch downstream pathways . We have recently performed a screen for conventional PIK and PIK - related kinases by similarity searches against the Schistosoma mansoni genome available to date [ 23 ] . We have classiﬁed the con - ventional PIK and PIK - related subtypes into ﬁve classes ( Models 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ) . Using the same methodology , we show herein the ﬁrst report of a PIK and PIK - related genomic survey from ﬁve hu - man pathogenic trypanosomatids : T . brucei , T . cruzi , L . major , L . bra - ziliensis and L . infantum . Materials and methods Complete protein sequences were used for the analyses and pseudogenes were excluded . Databases used for sequence analysis .

More details of other databases used can be obtained in [ 23 ] . Domain searches , classiﬁcation and phylogenetic inference . Classi - ﬁcation of different subtypes of PI - and related - kinases ( Models 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ) was performed according to [ 23 , 24 ] . Phylogenetic Inference was performed as described in [ 23 ] . Results Trypanosomatid PIKs genes and models In a recently study [ 23 ] we have proposed a novel classiﬁca - tion for the PIK genes of S . mansoni ( SmPIKs ) . SmPIKs were di - vided into ﬁve Models which were designated based on a previous report [ 24 ] . Using the same methodology , we show herein the ﬁrst survey of PIK and PIK - related genes from ﬁve human pathogenic trypanoso - matids , the so - called Try PIK inome ( Try panosomatid PI Kinome ) : T . brucei , T . cruzi , L . major , L . braziliensis and L . infantum . The trypan - osomatid PIK proteins ( TryPIKs ) were clustered into ﬁve groups according to their similarity and the presence of conserved do - mains ( described in Fig . 1 ) . The presence and order of the primary domains were used to determine the model to which the protein was assigned ( Table 1 ) . The Try PIK inome consists of four models ( Models 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , Fig 1 and Table 1 ) representing the conven - tional PI3 and PI4 kinases , and a ﬁfth model corresponding to PIK - related proteins ( Model 5 ) ( Tables 1 , 2 and Fig . 1 ) . In the Try PIK inome , Models 1 – 4 are comprised of 17 genes , whereas 31 genes are components of the Model 5 ( Fig . 1 and Tables 1 , 2 ) . In addition to the database mining strategy , our group has also currently been mapping all PIK members in the chromosomal bands of different T . cruzi lineages ( CL Brener clones and G strains ) in order to understand the genomic organization of the PIK family . PIK genes are not randomly dispersed throughout the genome of T . cruzi , suggesting that they are clustered in few chromosomes ( unpublished results ) . However , we also observed a chromosomal polymorphism between different parasite lineages , which may be due to the hybrid origin of the CL Brener genome [ 25 ] . Models 1 – 4 : trypanosomatid conventional PIKs Models 1 – 4 have been recently reviewed by our group [ 23 ] ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . In brief , Model 1 represents Class III PI3K , Model 2 represents Class I PI3K . and Models 3 and 4 represent the PI4 ki - nase family in humans . Model 3 is the ortholog of Pik1 in yeast and Model 4 is the ortholog of Stt4 in yeast . The biological functions of members of the Model 3 and Model 4 classes have not yet been de - scribed for trypanosomatids . For more details see [ 23 ] . Model 5 : PIK - related subtypes in trypanosomatids Model 5 contains the group of PIK - related proteins ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . The extreme C - terminus of PIK - related proteins contains the 33 - amino acid FATC motif , which is essential for the kinase activity of PIK - related proteins in mammalian systems . The FAT / kinase do - main / FATC structure occurs as a single unit in all known PIK - re - lated proteins [ 24 ] . The FAT motifs are weakly conserved between family members [ 24 ] . Ataxia - telangiectasia mutated Table 1 Phosphatydilinositol and related kinase proteins identiﬁed from the predicted proteomes of L . major , L . braziliensis , L . infantum , T . cruzi and T . brucei . Proteins were clustered into ﬁve groups according their similarity and the presence of the domains described in Fig . 1 . The primary domains determine the model to which the protein is assigned .

Bahia et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 963 – 970 965 ( ATM ) , ataxia - telangiectasia and Rad3 - related ( ATR ) , and the DNA - dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit ( DNA - PKcs ) are all members of the PIK - related family , and it has been argued that they are rapidly activated in response to different types of DNA damage [ 26 – 29 ] . ATM and DNA - PKcs respond primarily to DNA double - strand breaks , whereas ATR is activated by the presence of single - stranded DNA and stalled DNA replication forks . In all cases , activation involves recruitment of these kinases to the sites of DNA damage . As a result , the kinases activate cell cycle check - points and regulate DNA repair through phosphorylation of key protein targets . Members of the PIK - related family also regulate cell growth ( TOR ) and chromatin structure ( Trrap ) [ 24 ] . However , the mecha - nisms that regulate Trrap function remain unclear , since the PI - ki - nase domain of Trrap lacks the conserved amino acids required for ATP binding and catalytic activity ( see Fig . 3 ) . The wortmannin - reactive lysine is conserved in TryPIK phosphatidylinositol kinase domains Wortmannin interacts with many biological targets , but binds most tightly to PIK in vitro [ 30 , 31 ] . Previous proteolysis and muta - genesis studies of PIK revealed that Lys - 802 is the target for cova - lent attachment of wortmannin [ 30 ] . This lysine residue is found in the ATP binding site of the catalytic domain , and hence plays a cru - cial role in the phosphotransfer reaction . Inhibition of PIK is irre - versible and involves the formation of a vinylogous carbamate by an attack of the lysine side chain amino group onto the furan ring . This process leads to the covalent modiﬁcation of the lysine resi - due and formation of an irreversible adduct . In short , the noncova - lent binding interaction is sufﬁcient to inhibit the enzyme , and covalent Lys modiﬁcation makes it irreversible [ 31 ] . The kinase do - main of all TryPIKs is highly conserved ( Fig . 3 ) . Given that Lys is the site of covalent attachment of wortmannin , and is present in all TryPIK genes described in this study ( Fig . 3 ) , we expect that wort - mannin is likely to inhibit all PIK kinase activities of the ﬁve try - panosomatids described herein . Discussion The PIK pathway may present a novel target for treatment of parasitic diseases . In T . cruzi , for example , trypomastigote and amastigote treatments with wortmannin prevent parasite cell en - try , indicating that at least one PIK is essential for mammalian cell invasion by T . cruzi [ 32 , 33 ] . This observation suggests that the Try - PIK pathway is a suitable target for the design of speciﬁc inhibitors to prevent trypanosomatid parasitic infection . Exploring PIK activities in trypanosomatids At least two clear activities in which PIK may be the protagonist have been demonstrated in trypanosomatids , making PIK a prom - ising candidate target for designing drugs against trypanosomatid infection . First , the Model 1 kinase has been cloned and character - ized in T . brucei [ 34 ] and T . cruzi [ 35 ] . Moreover , the Model 5 TOR complex has also been cloned and characterized in T . brucei [ 36 – 38 ] . Here , we propose a putative signaling pathway for TryPIKs ( Fig . 2 ) . TryPIK Model 1 likely plays a role in membrane trafﬁcking and autophagy Model 1 or Vps34 ( the ‘oldest’ and the only Class III isoform present in yeast ) has been suggested to be involved in endosomal trafﬁcking , endocytosis , vesicle acidiﬁcation , and autophagy [ 39 – 42 ] . Autophagy is a mechanism that controls the degradation of cellular material to either provide nutrients during times of starva - tion or to eliminate unneeded proteins and / or organelles during normal growth and development [ 43 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Autophagosome for - mation is known to require PIP 3 and occurs near the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . A PIP 3 - binding protein with an unusual localization at ER and Golgi membranes relocates to a punctate compartment that colocalizes with autophagosomal proteins in response to ami - no acid starvation . Starvation - induced redistribution is dependent upon PIP 3 formation and recognition [ 44 ] . TryPIK Model 1 may potentially play this role in the trypanosomatid lysosomal / auto - phagosome system ( Fig . 2 ) . Recently Schoijet et al . [ 35 ] have demonstrated that overexpres - sion of the Model 1 kinase in T . cruzi epimastigotes produces distinctive morphological and functional changes related to mem - brane trafﬁcking . The presence of enlarged functional contractile vacuoles was evident in most overexpressing parasites . In addition , some of these cells showed hypertrophic alterations in the region near the cytostome and the ﬂagellar pocket . This phenotype could be originated by upstream membrane trafﬁcking from the enlarged contractile vacuole to these sites , where T . cruzi exchanges material with the environment [ 45 ] . Therefore , the authors concluded that the Model 1 has a role in osmoregulation [ 35 ] . T . cruzi Table 2 Accessory domains present in PIK - related proteins ( Model 5 ) .

Bahia et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 963 – 970 epimastigotes ( Y strain ) treated with wortmannin have also been shown to have morphological alterations in the ﬂagellar pocket and membrane detachment from the ﬂagellum [ 32 ] . Thus , the Try - PIK Model 1 likely plays a role in membrane trafﬁcking , since the ﬂagellar pocket and the cytostome are the main sites where this process occurs in trypanosomatids [ 46 , 34 ] . The same effect has been observed upon knockdown of TryPIK Model 1 expression by RNA interference in T . brucei [ 34 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Fig . 2 . Proposed signaling pathways for TryPIKs . ( I ) Signaling via trypanosomatid phosphatidylinositol kinases ( TryPIKs ) Model 2 may play an important role in growth control by regulating apoptosis , protein synthesis , cell proliferation , and autophagy . In multicellular organisms , the levels of intercellular growth factor signaling , such as insulin - dependent signaling , are reduced by starvation [ 47 ] . Binding of growth factors to cell surface receptors ( not yet well deﬁned in trypanosomatids ) activates Model 2 PIK for phosphorylation of plasma membrane bound PIP 2 to generate PIP 3 . PIP 3 functions as a high - afﬁnity binding ligand to recruit PH domain - containing proteins , including AKT / PKB , to the cell membrane [ 48 ] . The recruitment of AKT / PKB to the plasma membrane drives a conformational change in the protein , enabling the activation loop of AKT / PKB to undergo phosphorylation by the constitutively active phosphoinositide - dependent kinase 1 ( PDK1 ) . The small G protein Rheb stimulates TOR1 activity and is itself inhibited by the TSC1 / TSC2 complex . TSC2 is phosphorylated and inhibited by AKT / PKB . This signaling leads to regulation of the TOR pathway , which ultimately inhibits autophagy . By contrast , PTEN ( tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog ) antagonizes the action of Model 2 PIK by dephosphorylating PIP 3 and suppressing the activation of AKT / PKB . In addition , PTEN inhibits the TOR pathway . Therefore , the Model 1 PIK may be necessary for activation of autophagic vacuole formation . Model 1 is said to participate in late endocytosis and vesicular trafﬁcking in T . brucei [ 34 ] and osmoregulation and membrane trafﬁcking in T . cruzi [ 35 ] . Starvation or growth factor deprivation triggers autophagy by modifying TOR signaling [ 49 , 43 ] . TOR suppresses autophagy , whereas Atg proteins may be required for autophagic vacuole formation . As a result , TOR activity is assumed to be regulated via feedback loops that prevent insufﬁcient or excessive autophagy . In T . brucei , TOR2 forms a complex with the 12 kDa cytosolic protein FKBP - 12 and rapamycin [ 36 ] . In addition , TOR2 may directly phosphorylate and activate AKT / PKB , although the regulation of TOR2 signaling remains unclear . TOR2 has also been implicated in modulation of cytoskeletal organization , endocytosis , and cytokinesis [ 37 , 38 ] . ( II ) Autophagy is a self - digestive process in which portions of cytoplasm are sequestered into specialized vesicles known as autophagosomes [ 50 , 51 ] . Autophagosome fusion with the endosomal / lysosomal compartment leads to hydrolytic digestion of the autophagosome cargo , providing an internal source of nutrients that can support energy production or biosynthesis [ 51 , 52 ] . D . Bahia et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 963 – 970 967 TryPIK Model 5 regulates cell growth , cytoskeletal remodeling and cytokinesis Barquilla et al . [ 36 ] have shown that control of cell growth in T . brucei is regulated by two functionally distinct TOR kinases through signaling by two TOR complexes ( TORC ) . TOR proteins belong to the Model 5 group ( Fig . 2 and Tables 1 , 2 ) . TbTOR1 , which localizes to the nucleus , regulates temporal aspects of cell growth by signaling through TORC1 . In contrast , TbTOR2 binds exclusively to the TORC2 complex , which regulates cytoskeletal remodeling , cell polariza - Fig . 3 . Multiple alignment of the wortmannin - reactive lysine in the phosphatidylinositol kinase domain of PIKs and PIK - related proteins . TryPIKs sequences were aligned around the wortmannin - reactive Lys ( K ) of the catalytic subunit of PI3K . PI3K from pigs ( locus PK3CG _ PIG , Accession No . O02697 ) and humans ( locus PK3CA _ HUMAN , Accession Nos . P42336 , Q14CW1 and Q99762 ) were used as outgroups . The highlighted motifs DRHxxN and DFG show the parts of the catalytic site in the PIK proteins which are not found in Trrap related kinases . 968 D . Bahia et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 963 – 970 tion , and cytokinesis . TbTOR2 is cytosolic , localizing to cytoplasmic organelles , including the mitochondria and , to a lesser extent , the ER . This localization pattern and the role of the TORC2 complex in cytoskeletal remodeling suggests that TbTOR2 may be essential for interactions with downstream effectors involved in cytoskeletal regulation of membrane trafﬁc . Intriguingly , rapamycin , a potent TOR inhibitor , acts as an effective trypanocide and impairs cell pro - liferation . In most eukaryotes , rapamycin inhibits the TORC1 , but not the TORC2 , complex . However , in T . brucei , rapamycin decreases proliferation through inhibition of TORC2 complex formation ( Fig . 2 ) , while the TORC1 complex is unaffected [ 36 – 38 ] . Since the activities of TORC1 , including regulation of protein synthesis , are unaffected by rapamycin , the dramatic morphological defects in - duced by the drug in T . brucei , including defects in cell polarization , endocytosis , and cytokinesis , are likely due to inhibition of TORC2 activity [ 36 – 38 ] . Moreover , the T . brucei genome also contains two other TOR family proteins , termed TbTOR - like 1 and TbTOR - like 2 . These proteins have a similar domain structure to other TOR proteins . We have used this nomenclature to classify TOR - like proteins from other related trypanosomatids ( Table 1 ) . The unique and selective inhibition of the TORC2 complex by rapamycin in T . brucei , taken together with the essential role of TORC2 in trypanosomes , make TryPIK Model 5 an attractive target for anti - parasitic drugs . Model 5 are also attractive drug targets be - cause , in TbTOR proteins , multiple residues of the FRAP domain ( Table 2 ) , which is involved in FKBP12 - rapamycin binding , differ from those of the human protein . These differences could allow for the design of potent rapamycin analogs that selectively inhibit TbTOR2 , avoiding immunosuppression caused by inhibition of the human TOR proteins . Concluding remarks The involvement of TryPIKs in fundamental pathways , such as intracellular signal transduction and host invasion processes , makes the study of TryPIKs an important area for further inquiry . In addition to enhancing our understanding of trypanosomatid biology and host relationships , these studies may lead to the dis - covery of novel gene products which could serve as targets for the development of new drugs and vaccines to control parasitic diseases .
