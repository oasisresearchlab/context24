523 scientificreport ©2003 EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ORGANIZATION EMBO reports VOL 4 | NO 5 | 2003 scientific report We have examined the effect of covalently crosslinked profilin – actin ( PxA ) , which closely matches the biochemical prop - erties of ordinary profilin – actin and interferes with actin polymer - ization in vitro and in vivo , on Listeria monocytogenes motility . PxA caused a marked reduction in bacterial motility , which was accompanied by the detachment of bacterial tails . The effect of PxA was dependent on its binding to proline - rich sequences , as shown by the inability of P H133S xA , which cannot interact with such sequences , to impair Listeria motility . PxA did not alter the motility of a Listeria mutant that is unable to recruit Ena ( Enabled ) / VASP ( vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) proteins and profilin to its surface . Finally , PxA did not block the initiation of actin - tail forma - tion , indicating that profilin – actin is only required for the elonga - tion of actin filaments at the bacterial surface . Our findings provide further evidence that profilin – actin is important for actin - based processes , and show that it has a key function in Listeria motility . EMBO reports 4 , 523 – 529 ( 2003 ) doi : 10 . 1038 / sj . embor . embor823 INTRODUCTION A rapid and spatially controlled turnover of actin filaments is indis - pensable for a variety of biological processes , such as lamellipodia extension during cell motility , phagocytosis and the intracellular movement of some bacterial and viral pathogens , such as Listeria monocytogenes ( Frischknecht & Way , 2001 ; Cossart & Bierne , 2001 ) . Among the proteins that have been implicated in the regulation of actin - filament dynamics is profilin , which was originally discovered as an actin - monomer - binding protein ( Carlsson et al . , 1977 ) . Profilin is localized to highly dynamic regions of cultured cells , such as the tips of spreading lamellipodia and focal adhesions ( Theriot & Mitchison , 1993 ; Geese et al . , 2000 ) , and also accumulates at the rear end of motile Listeria ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; Smith et al . , 1996 ; Geese et al . , 2000 ) . The deletion of the genes encoding profilin alters the architec - ture of the actin cytoskeleton , severely impairs cell migration and leads , in most cases , to lethality ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ; Haugwitz et al . , 1994 ; Witke et al . , 2001 ; Schlüter et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , profilin binds to cellular components implicated in the con - trol of actin dynamics , such as phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , Enabled ( Ena ) / VASP ( vasodilator - stimulated phospho - protein ) proteins , N - WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) and p140mDia ( Frazier & Field , 1997 ; Schlüter et al . , 1997 ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ; Sechi & Wehland , 2000 ) . In vitro , profilin forms a 1 : 1 complex with actin ( profilin – actin ) , which can participate in the elongation of actin filaments at their ( + ) ends ( Korenbaum et al . , 1998 ; Kang et al . , 1999 ; Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . However , when actin filament ( + ) ends are capped , profilin acts as an efficient inhibitor of actin nucleation . Moreover , the binding of profilin to actin enhances the exchange rate of ADP to ATP on actin ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1992 ) , and profilin can synergize with other actin - monomer - binding proteins , such as thymosin - β 4 and the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin , to increase actin - filament turnover ( Pantaloni & Carlier , 1993 ; Didry et al . , 1998 ) . Finally , a crosslinked profilin – actin ( PxA ) complex , the structure and function of which is similar to that of unmodified profilin – actin , inhibits both the nucleation and the elongation rate of actin filaments in vitro ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . This provides evidence that profilin – actin can bind to the ( + ) ends of actin filaments as a complex . This is supported by the observation that PxA alters actin - filament organization and blocks lamellipodial extension in cultured cells ( Hajkova et al . , 2000 ) . To improve our understanding of the function of profilin – actin in actin - filament dynamics , we have studied the effect of PxA on Listeria motility . Our data provide further evidence that profilin – actin is important for actin - based processes and demonstrate that it has a key function in Listeria motility . RESULTSProfilin – actin impairs the intracellular motility of Listeria To test the effect of PxA on the intracellular actin - based motility of Listeria , we injected PxA at a needle concentration of 5 mg ml − 1 , which has been found to be effective when used on cultured cells ( Hajkova et al . , 2000 ) , into PtK2 cells infected with Listeria . Forty minutes after injection , cells were fixed and labelled with fluores - cent phalloidin to detect host - cell actin filaments and the bacteria - associated actin tails . In uninjected PtK2 cells or cells that were treated with G - buffer , Listeria were associated with normal actin tails ( Fig . 1A ; arrowheads in Fig . 1C ) .

Listeria - infected PtK2 cells were injected with 20 mg ml − 1 PxA and were observed by video microscopy .

Grenklo et al . 525 injected with 5 mg ml − 1 PxA , all bacteria were associated with short actin tails ( Fig . 1A ; arrowheads in Fig . 1B ) , indicating that PxA impairs Listeria motility . PxA reduces Listeria speed and causes tail detachment To gain further insight into the effect of PxA on Listeria motility , we analysed bacterial movement by video microscopy . Before injec - tion , Listeria were clearly associated with phase - dense actin tails and moved at an average speed of 10 . 2 ± 2 . 58 (cid:1) m min − 1 ( Fig . 2A – C ) . Shortly after injection of PxA ( needle concentration of 20 mg ml − 1 ) , typically within 30 s , bacterial speed was reduced to an average of 2 . 71 ± 0 . 73 (cid:1) m min − 1 ( Fig . 2A , green and red arrows ; Fig . 2B , C ; and supplementary information ) . Moreover , due to the impairment of actin assembly at the bacterial surface , the actin tails depolymerized within 3 min of injection of PxA ( Fig . 2A , frames for 130 s and 180 s ) , the bacteria remained associated with a fuzzy phase - dense material ( Fig . 2A , arrows in frame for 180 s ) , and their movement became irregular . The same result was obtained after injection of PxA at con - centrations as low as 3 . 5 mg ml − 1 , whereas no perturbation of bacte - rial motility was observed after injection of G - buffer ( Fig . 2B , C ; and data not shown ) . Next , we analysed the effect of PxA on Listeria motility using MDCK ( Madin – Darby canine kidney ) cells that stably express green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – actin . This actin derivative was incorporated into actin filaments and Listeria actin tails without markedly altering actin dynamics ( Choidas et al . , 1998 ) , and is therefore a reliable probe for analysing PxA - induced changes in actin tails in detail . Before and shortly after injection of PxA ( 5 mg ml − 1 ) , Listeria cells were associated with normal actin tails ( Fig . 3 , frame for 10 s ; compare with Fig . 1C ) . Approximately 30 s after injection , a break appeared between the bac - terium and its tail ( Fig . 3 , frame for 32 s ) and this , in agreement with the results obtained previously , was followed by the rapid depolymer - ization of the actin tail ( Fig . 3 , frames for 76 s and 120 s ; and supple - mentary information ) . At this stage , the bacterium , which was no longer associated with its tail , was surrounded by a cloud of actin , which presumably corresponded to the fuzzy phase - dense material observed around the bacteria in phase - contrast images ( Fig . 2A ) . Overall , the effect of PxA on Listeria motility appears to be charac - terized by two steps : the impairment of actin - tail assembly at the bac - terial surface , and the detachment of the bacteria from their actin tails . PxA binds proline - rich regions to inhibit Listeria motility Previous in vitro data have shown that PxA binds to the free ( + ) ends of actin filaments , thereby inhibiting their elongation ( Hajkova et al . , 2000 ; Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , it is possible that the impair - ment of Listeria motility is due to the binding of PxA to the ( + ) ends of the actin filaments that abut the bacterial surface . As the targeting of profilin , and possibly profilin – actin complexes , to the bacterial surface is mediated by the interaction with the central proline - rich region of Ena / VASP proteins ( Geese et al . , 2000 , 2002 ) , the local - ization of which at this site is not affected by PxA ( see supplemen - tary information ) , it is possible that this interaction is required for the inhibitory effect of PxA on bacterial motility . To test this hypothesis , we generated a PxA complex using the profilin mutant protein , P H133S , which does not bind to poly - L - proline , although it retains the ability to associate with both monomeric actin and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Björkegren - Sjögren et al . , 1997 ) . Injection of the complex of P H133S and actin ( P H133S xA ) at 5 mg ml − 1 into Listeria - infected PtK2 cells did not change the motility of the bacteria ( Fig . 4A – C ; and supplementary informa - tion ) , indicating that poly - L - proline - dependent interactions are essential for targeting PxA to the Listeria surface , where it exerts its inhibitory effect . This was also supported by the observation that PxA does not affect the motility of the Listeria mutant strain ActA5 , which expresses a modified version of ActA that lacks the central proline - rich region . As a consequence , these bacteria are unable to recruit Ena / VASP proteins and profilin , and move at a reduced speed ( Smith et al . , 1996 ; Niebuhr et al . , 1997 ; Geese et al . , 2000 ; see supplementary information ) . PxA does not inhibit formation of Listeria actin tails Next , we analysed whether PxA affects the initiation of actin - tail formation . Because the rapid and severe effects of PxA on cells ( Hajkova et al . , 2000 ) prevented us from carrying out this investi - gation in living cells , we decided to use a cell - free system based on mouse cytosolic brain extracts that are able to support Listeria motility . This system has been shown to be useful for studying inhibitors of actin cytoskeleton components ( May et al . , 1999 ) . We incubated mouse cytosolic extracts with various amounts of PxA on ice for 30 min , and then added Listeria to induce the formation of actin tails ( incubation with Listeria was carried out at 20 ° C for 15 – 30 min ) . In control extracts , Listeria induced the formation of actin tails and moved at an average speed of 0 . 5 ± 0 . 16 (cid:1) m min − 1 ( Fig . 5 ) . Interestingly , in the presence of PxA , Listeria were still able to induce the formation of actin tails , but their motility was impaired by PxA in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 5 ; and supplementary information ) . This effect was not due to the dilution of the cytosolic extract ( its total protein concentration was reduced by a half at the highest PxA concen - tration tested ) , as indicated by the observation that an extract diluted with G - buffer supported Listeria motility to the same extent as control extracts ( Fig . 5 ) . 10 s 32 s 76 s 120 s G F P – ac t i n P h a s e c o n t r a s t Fig . 3 | Effects of profilin – actin on Listeriamonocytogenes motility analysed in Madin – Darby canine kidney cells expressing green fluorescent protein – actin .

Upper panels show phase - contrast images ; lower panels show corresponding GFP – actin fluorescence . Shortly after injection , a break ( green arrow ; frame for 32 s ) appeared between the bacterium ( red arrowhead , lower frame for 32 s ) and its tail , followed by the complete depolymerization of the actin tail ( frames for 76 s and 120 s ) . The bacterium remained associated with a cloud of actin filaments ( white arrows and arrowheads , frames for 76 s and 120 s ) and moved slowly .

Grenklo et al . 526 DISCUSSION We have shown that profilin – actin has a crucial role in actin - based Listeria motility . The Ena / VASP - dependent recruitment of profilin or profilin – actin at the Listeria surface is thought to medi - ate the efficient elongation of actin filaments at this site . This notion is supported by two lines of evidence . First , displacement or absence of Ena / VASP proteins from the Listeria surface results in a lack of profilin recruitment to this site and impairs bacterial motility ( Smith et al . , 1996 ; Kang et al . , 1997 ; Niebuhr et al . , 1997 ; Geese et al . , 2000 , 2002 ) . Similarly , Ena / VASP mutants lacking the central proline - rich region cannot target profilin or profilin – actin to the bacterial surface , resulting in decreased and irregular Listeria motility ( Geese et al . , 2002 ) . Second , the deple - tion of profilin from cell extracts reduces Listeria motility ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ) , whereas its addition to a set of purified proteins that can support bacterial motility causes an increase in motility ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . Consistent with these findings , our data indicate that profilin – actin is the source of actin monomers required for efficient filament elongation at the Listeria surface . Because PxA does not affect the formation of Listeria tails , a process that requires the actin - nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( May et al . , 1999 ; Pistor et al . , 2000 ; Skoble et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) , we conclude that the initiation of actin tails does not depend on pro - filin – actin . This is also supported by the observation that PxA has no effect on the motility of Listeria ActA5 , the movement of which depends exclusively on the nucleation and inefficient elongation of actin filaments induced by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Our theory is also consistent with studies showing that Listeria ActA provides the actin monomers necessary for the actin - nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Skoble et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) . Current models for actin - filament elongation predict that profilin – actin interacts with free actin - filament ( + ) ends . Suggestions as to how profilin – actin might participate in actin polymerization have come from studies of the molecular organization of crystals of profil - in – actin ( Schutt et al . , 1993 ) . Actin monomers are tightly associated in a ribbon - like arrangement , which is suggested to be an intermediate state during actin polymerization ( Cedergren - Zeppezauer et al . , 1994 ) . In this model , a ribbon - to - helix transformation would take − 2 − 1 0 2 4 8 6 12 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 4 2 0 6 10 8 12 14 G - buffer G - buffer I n s t a n t a n e o u s s p ee d ( u m m i n v − 1 ) A v e r a g e s p ee d ( (cid:1) m m i n − 1 ) 5 mg ml − 1 PxA – ActA5 5 mg ml − 1 PxA – ActA5 5 mg ml − 1 H133S WT 5 mg ml − 1 H133S Before injection After injection ( 21 ) ( 20 ) ( 42 ) B A C Time ( min ) − 190 s + 100 s + 200 s − 90 s 0 s Fig . 4 | ( A ) The ability of profilin – actin to interact with proline - rich regions is essential for its inhibitory effect on Listeria monocytogenes motility . PtK2 cells infected with wild - type Listeria were injected with 5 mg ml − 1 P H133S xA ( a complex of the H133S mutant form of profilin with actin ) and observed using video microscopy . Before injection , wild - type Listeria were associated with actin tails and moved at normal speed ( arrow in frames for − 190 s and − 90 s ) , which was not affected by the injection of P H133S xA ( arrow in frames for + 100 s and + 200 s ) .

The injection of 5 mg ml − 1 P H133S xA or of G - buffer did not alter the motility of wild - type Listeria . Similarly , PxA did not change the motility of Listeria ActA5 .

Grenklo et al . 527 place after the release of profilin , allowing the formation of more actin – actin contacts ( Cedergren - Zeppezauer et al . , 1994 ) . This is sup - ported by the fact that PxA inhibits the incorporation of actin monomers into filaments in the presence of unmodified profilin – actin , without becoming incorporated into filaments itself ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , in the initial interaction state , PxA binds weakly to actin filament ( + ) ends , and the incoming actin must be freed from profilin to allow it to enter into the more stable helix conformation . The more dramatic effect of PxA on actin filament formation in vivo suggests that PxA blocks the actin - polymerizing machinery by binding to one of its components with high affinity . Our observations strongly suggest that the influence of PxA on Listeria motility is due to its high - affinity inter - action with Ena / VASP proteins , and that the failure to dislodge profilin prohibits stable incorporation of actin into the growing filaments , resulting in filament breakage . Recently , Dickinson & Purich ( 2002 ) proposed a model in which Listeria motility depends on a ‘molecular clamp’ that controls actin assembly at the interface between bacteria and actin tails . We argue that PxA blocks the ‘molecular clamp’ and causes actin - tail detachment , as described above . It should be noted that our results do not discriminate between an actin helix formed by a ribbon - to - helix process , as described above , and the Holmes model of F - actin ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) ; this requires the determination of the atomic structure of F - actin . In addition to being crucial for Listeria motility , profilin is required for the formin - dependent assembly of actin cables in budding yeasts , and enhances formin - induced actin filament assembly in vitro ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , the interaction of profilin with both actin and poly - L - proline is required for the forma - tion of microspikes in fibroblasts ( Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ) and actin cables in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Sagot et al . , 2002 ) , and for the intracellular motility of Shigella flexneri ( Mimuro et al . , 2000 ; Lommel et al . , 2001 ) ; it is also essential for the viability of fission yeast ( Lu & Pollard , 2001 ) . These findings , together with the present study and the work of Hajkova et al . ( 2000 ) , indicate that profilin – actin provides a pool of monomeric actin that is ready to support actin filament elonga - tion on interaction with key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics , such as WASP and N - WASP proteins , formins and Ena / VASP proteins . METHODS Preparation of crosslinked profilin – β - actin . Bovine profilin I and β - and γ - actin were purified as described in Hajkova et al . ( 2000 ) and Nyman et al . ( 2002 ) . Non - dissociable PxA was prepared as described by Nyman et al . ( 2002 ) . To generate P H133S xA , human H133S profilin ( Korenbaum et al . , 1998 ; and references therein ) was crosslinked to β - actin as for wild - type profilin , except that the coupling was done at a molar ratio of 12 : 1 of H133S profilin to β - actin . The crosslinked profilin – β - actin was concentrated using the Ultrafree - 15 Centrifugal Filter Device ( Millipore ) , stored on ice , and used within 2 – 6 days . Bacterial and cell culture , transfection and infection . The L . monocytogenes mutant ActA5 ( Niebuhr et al . , 1997 ) and wild - type strains were grown in brain – heart infusion broth ( BHI ; DIFCO Laboratories ) as described previously ( Geese et al . , 2002 ) . PtK2 and MDCK cells were grown as described in Geese et al . ( 2000 ) . MDCK cells were transfected with GFP – actin ( provided by B . Imhof ) using FuGene 6 , in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . One day after transfection , positive cells were selected using 1 mg ml − 1 G418 .

Grenklo et al . 528 Microinjection of Listeria - infected cells and in vitro motility assays . Injection of PxA was usually performed 3 h after the start of the infection , using an IM300 microinjector and an oil - driven manipulator ( Narishige ) . We estimated that we injected a volume of PxA that was , on average , one - tenth of the cellular volume . The intracellular concentration of PxA would , therefore , be in the range of 0 . 5 – 2 . 0 mg ml − 1 , depending on the experiment . Images of injected cells were acquired with an Axiovert 135 TV micro - scope ( Zeiss ) equipped with a LD - Achroplan 40 × / 0 . 60 NA ( numerical aperture ) lens using a C3077 CCD camera driven by the Argus 20 image processor ( Hamamatsu ) . Images were record - ed on videotape and digitalized using the Scion Frame Grabber VG - 5 and Scion Image 1 . 62 software . The effect of PxA on the motility of Listeria in mouse cytosolic brain extracts was analysed as described by May et al . ( 1999 ) . Images were acquired as described above . Immunofluorescence microscopy and analysis of bacterial speed . Fixation and labelling of Listeria - infected cells and the analysis of bacterial movement were carried out as described in Geese et al . ( 2002 ) .
