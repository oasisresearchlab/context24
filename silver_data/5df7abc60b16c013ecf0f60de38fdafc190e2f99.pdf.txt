CHEMISTRY EDUCATION : RESEARCH AND PRACTICE 2004 , Vol . 5 , No . 1 , pp . 33 - 50 RESEARCH REPORT ( EMPIRICAL STUDY ) Methods and issues of teaching and learning Panagiotis SARANTOPOULOS and Georgios TSAPARLIS University of Ioannina , Department of Chemistry ( Greece ) ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING AS A MEANS OF ATTAINMENT OF COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE OBJECTIVES : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY IN A NATURALISTIC SETTING , USING ANALOGIES WITH A STRONG SOCIAL CONTENT Received 23 December 2003 ; in final form / accepted 16 February 2004 ABSTRACT : A longitudinal study of the use of chemical analogies and their effect on cognitive and affective factors of tenth - and eleventh - grade Greek students in a naturalistic setting is reported . Attention was paid to the structural correspondence between the analogue and the target . Regarding the analogue domain , emphasis was placed on using analogies with a strong and familiar social context . An experimental - control group design was adopted . Although it is difficult to separate the direct effect of the analogies from the social relevance and the enjoyment factors , our findings from questions set immediately after the introduction of each analogy , as well as from final examinations , provide evidence for the possible usefulness of the long - term use of analogies in the teaching of chemistry . Gender was found to make no difference . Analogies can be more effective for lower cognitive development students . A positive affective effect to most students was also found . Both developmental level and motivational trait play a definitive role , with the concrete students on the one hand , and the curious students on the other found to be more favourably disposed to this teaching strategy . Finally , recommendations for the proper and effective use of analogies in chemistry teaching are made . [ Chem . Educ . Res . Pract . : 2004 , 5 , 33 - 50 ] KEY WORDS : instructional analogies ; chemical analogies ; analogue domain ; target domain ; developmental level ; motivational trait INTRODUCTION In a review of studies on the effectiveness of instructional analogies in science education ( Dagher , 1995a ) , a synthesis of the findings was provided , and implications for teachers and researchers in science education were presented . Among various suggestions for future investigations were that (cid:147)longitudinal studies in naturalistic ( formal and informal ) settings are needed to broaden our notion of the spontaneous and creative uses of analogy and metaphor as they relate to the learning of new concepts , the restructuring of old ones , and the interpretation of knowledge networks across domains over time . (cid:148) Friedel , Gabel and Samuel ( 1990 ) also considered it very likely that to be effective , analogies must be used for a long time . The desirability of longitudinal studies in science education , that is of following up the same subjects from the short to the long - term , has been repeatedly advocated , particularly in (cid:145)implications(cid:146) and (cid:145)recommendations(cid:146) sections of research articles . Yet , there is a mismatch between the importance placed on longitudinal studies and the actual number of such studies in science education ( Arzi , 1988 , p . 17 ) . Dagher ( 1995a ) , further pointed out that (cid:147)studies reviewed affirm that meaningful SARANTOPOULOS & TSAPARLIS 34 learning via instructional analogies is not a function of whether an analogy is used , as much as it is a function of how it is actually used ( in text , presentation , or discussion ) , by whom , with whom , and consequently how it is evaluated . (cid:148) The interaction of all these factors could provide a clearer understanding of the contribution of analogy to science learning . Although the work described in this paper was undertaken prior to the publication of the review by Dagher , we hope that it addresses at least some of the above recommendations . This work is longitudinal , in a naturalistic setting , with the junior researcher being the teacher himself , and an enthusiastic user of instructional analogies before undertaking the research work reported here . A consistent method of using the analogies throughout the instruction was used , a method that concentrated on the proper understanding of each analogy by the students , with the aid of the structural correspondence between the analogue and the target domains . We have paid special attention to the analogue domain of the analogies , so that it was familiar and interesting to the student ; thus , we have used in chemistry teaching , analogies with a strong social context . In recent years , there has been an increased number of studies on the role of analogies in students(cid:146) learning of science ( including chemistry ) . A special issue of the Journal of Research of Science Teaching ( Vol . 30 , Issue No . 10 , 1993 ) , plus a number of reviews ( Duit , 1991 ; Goswami , 1991 ; Dagher , 1995a ) and additional studies demonstrate the related interest of the science education community . Glynn , Duit and Thiele ( 1995 ) provided an overview of the teaching - with - analogies ( TWA ) model ( Glynn , 1989 ) , which shows how to use an analogy systematically to explain fundamental concepts in a meaningful way . In addition , Glynn , Duit and Britton ( 1995 ) have examined the use of analogies by students when solving problems to plan , monitor , evaluate , and improve their problem - solving efforts . Dagher ( 1994 ) has reviewed the contribution of analogies to conceptual change and noted a modest contribution of analogies to normal conceptual change . In another paper ( Dagher , 1995b ) , the analogies used by science teachers in naturalistic instructional settings were analysed , and some of their special characteristics highlighted . On a similar line , the use of analogies in science instruction by student teachers has been examined by Jarman ( 1996 ) . The effectiveness of teaching science with pictorial analogies has been tested , through a conceptual problem - solving test , on the concepts of density , pressure , and atmospheric pressure in Year - 8 classrooms ( Lin , Shiau , & Lawrenz , 1996 ) ; it was found that students taught with pictorial analogies scored significantly higher than the control group , while low achievers benefited more from this teaching than high achievers . Learning from analogy - enhanced science text , where an elaborate analogy having both graphic and text components was used , has been found conducive to better biology learning by sixth and eighth graders ( Glynn & Takahashi , 1998 ) . Concentrating on the use of analogies in chemistry teaching , Thile and Treagust ( 1994 ) reported the relevant practice by four teachers . The teachers used analogies spontaneously and on a planned basis , both for the whole classes and individually for students who had conceptual difficulties . The study described why the teachers chose to use analogies , the variation of the characteristics of the analogies from teacher to teacher , and the origin of the analogies . According to the authors , the analogies used had a motivational impact on the students . HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Analogies have been used by the followers of the mechanism doctrine ( 17 - 18 century ) , such as that used by the French physician and alchemist Nikola Lemery ( 1675 - 1715 ) for acids and bases , in his text cours de chymie , published in 1675 ( Lemery , 1716 , ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY 35 cited in Westfall , 1977 ) . In addition , analogies have often been used as mechanisms for theory change in science ( Vosniadou , 1989b ; p . 432 ) ; examples are Newton(cid:146)s theory on the corpuscular nature of light , Thomson(cid:146)s and Rutherford(cid:146)s models of the atom , the duality ( particles and waves ) of the nature of particles proposed by de Broglie ( Vosniadou , 1989b , p . 433 ) , and the analogy between classical mechanics and geometrical optics for the justification of the Schr(cid:246)dinger equation ( Landau & Lifschitz , 1965 ; Atkins , 1970 ) . Needless to add that the use of analogies by distinguished scientists constitutes both an incitement and an invitation to the teacher of chemistry to use analogies in teaching . We assume that an analogy is a system of relations ( correspondences ) that hold between parts of the structure of two domains . The analogue domain ( called also source or base domain ) is a domain that exists in memory , from which the analogy is drawn ; and the target domain , which contains the science concept under study , that is the instructional objective of the analogy . The analogue domain then contains the analogical representation of the target ( Dagher et al . , 1993 ) . An analogy involves the transfer of relational ( structural ) information from the analogue to the target , a transfer which is accomplished by mapping or matching processes , which consists of finding the correspondences between the two systems ( Vosniadou , 1989a ; 1989b , p . 414 ) . The two systems may belong to different domains , but share a similar explanatory structure . In this case , we have the between - domain ( or metaphorical ) analogies . One example is the analogy between the atom and the solar system , which is based on the similarity in the structure of the two systems . It may also be that the two items of the analogical mapping are drawn from the same or very close domains . In the latter case we have the within - domain ( or literal ) analogies , such as the use of examples of solved problems to work out how to solve other ( similar ) problems ( Anderson & Thomson , 1989 ; Thagard , 1992 ) . The two kinds of analogies represent the two ends of a continuum rather than a dichotomy ( Vosniadou , 1989b , p . 415 ) . The plethora of analogies published in the feature (cid:145)Applications and Analogies (cid:146) of the Journal of Chemical Education , ( edited by R . DeLorenzo ) , together with analogies from other sources ( for example , chemistry textbooks ) demonstrate that quite often we use situations from everyday life as analogues in chemistry teaching , that is between - domain analogies . We have used such analogies in this work , and will term them analogies with a strong social context . They have the feature that the analogue domain is familiar to the student , an important requirement for an effective instructional analogy . The familiarity and the closeness of the analogue domain favours the mapping of the elements of the two domains , and allows students to construct and examine their own knowledge , by attracting them to see and examine it through the process of the analogy ( Black & Solomon , 1987 ) . Note that the ineffective use of certain analogies has been attributed to the fact that students were not familiar with the analogue domain ( Gabel & Sherwood , 1980 ) . According to the multiple - constraint theory ( Holyak & Thagard , 1989 ; Thagard et al . , 1990 ; Thagard , 1992 ) an analogy should satisfy three fundamental constraints to be effective in teaching . One constraint is the pragmatic relevance of the analogue to the target , that is analogical thinking that is sensitive to the purpose for which the analogy is being used ; we are concerned with analogies whose purpose is to convey an understanding of unfamiliar material of chemistry to students . The second constraint is the structural correspondence between the analogue and the target . Finally , there must exist semantic similarity between the elements of the analogue domain and those of the target domain . Note that the multiple - constraint theory of Holyak and Thagard differs from the structure - mapping theory of Gentner ( 1983 , 1989 ) in adding the pragmatic and semantic constraints to the structural one . An important factor which should also be carefully checked and controlled is the SARANTOPOULOS & TSAPARLIS 36 information - processing demand of the analogy , since the student has to hold the analogy and the chemical actuality in working memory at the same time . If the demand exceeds a student(cid:146)s processing capacity , it may lead to mental overload , and this may be a major problem for some students ( Johnstone , 1995 ) . Analogical reasoning can be used in two distinct cases ( Vosniadou , 1989b , p . 422 ) . In one case , the underlying structure shared between the analogue and the target domains is present in the subject(cid:146)s representation of both domains at the time when the analogy is used . In the other case , the underlying structure needs to be present only in the subject(cid:146)s representation of the analogue . This latter case is important for the acquisition of new knowledge . Thus , the instructional use of analogy where the analogue is given , and similarity in explanatory structure is discovered by the learner on the basis of similarity in the salient properties of two systems , is an instance where analogical reasoning can lead to the acquisition of new knowledge . This case is therefore of paramount importance to the chemistry teacher , and it has been used in our work . With the instructional objectives in mind , analogies are further distinguished into clarifying and why - answering ones ( Thagard , Cohen & Holyoak , 1989 ; Thagard , 1992 ) . In our opinion , the former tend to satisfy objectives of the Bloom cognitive categories of knowledge and of understanding , while the latter extend their effect to the higher categories , viz . , application , analysis , synthesis and evaluation . Taking into account that the effectiveness of an instructional strategy is a function of the fulfillment of its instructional objectives , the above distinction provides a crucial criterion for the selection of the proper analogy in instruction . Finally , a good knowledge of the analogue domain , as well as a realisation of the limitations of the application of an analogy , are crucial for an analogy to be effective ( Vosniadou , 1989b , p . 425 ; Duit , 1991 , p . 664 ; Thagard , 1992 , p . 542 ) . Ignorance or lack of consideration of the limitations entails the risk of misconceptions , which are among the most serious pitfalls of the instructional use of analogies . It is generally acknowledged , however , that it is impossible to find perfect analogies within the context that do not lead to any misconceptions ( Dagher , et al . , 1993 ) . METHOD One hundred and forty - eight students , of which 61 were males and 87 females , attending year 1 ( tenth grade ) of a state upper secondary school in Athens , Greece , participated in the study . The school draws its students from an urban district , with an average family income . The subjects were randomly divided into an experimental group ( N = 82 , 35 males and 47 females ) , and a control group ( N = 66 , 26 males and 40 females ) . Of these 148 students , 116 ( 45 males and 71 females ) continued in year 2 ( eleventh grade ) , with 68 ( 31 males and 37 females ) in the experimental group and 48 ( 14 males and 34 females ) in the control group . The subjects were drawn from two consecutive cohorts , in the school years 1992 - 93 and 1993 - 94 . [ We define cohort as a group of subjects all of whom are at the same chronological stage at the same period , and hence share similar environmental influences ( Arzi , 1988 , p . 21 ) . ] Students were informed that the research aimed at helping them understand chemistry . Table 1 shows the units taught and the total teaching time . The teacher throughout the study was one of the authors ( PS ) , with about nine years of teaching experience , and a strong personal interest in the use of analogies in the teaching of chemistry . In the control group , formal instruction was used , with the teacher lecturing in the traditional way , that is , presenting the new knowledge , with the students just listening and ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY 37 TABLE 1 .

The method adopted included the three stages of analogical reasoning : ( i ) retrieving the analogue , ( ii ) mapping it to the target , and ( iii ) transferring to the target the relevant components of the analogue . Furthermore , the method showed considerable agreement with the teaching - with - analogies model ( Glynn , 1989 , p . 198 ) . The elements of the analogue domain ( that is the analogy itself ) were first presented to the students . A discussion followed or students answered questions concerning the analogue in writing . The aim was to find out the extent to which they were familiar with the analogue domain , as well as possible misconceptions or misunderstandings with respect to this domain . Subsequently , students were supplied with a list of one - to - one correspondences of the elements of the analogue with those of the target , and were asked immediately to answer a number of chemical questions , aiming at all categories of the cognitive domain of the Bloom taxonomy . The students were encouraged to make use of the correspondences , and informed that their correct or wrong answers would have no effect on their assessment . Each student was supplied with a sheet showing the analogue - target correspondences , and giving the chemical questions that the student had to answer . Table 2 has the structural correspondences for two of the analogies used . The possibility of cheating in these and all other examinations was reduced to a minimum , by having each student on a separate desk , and by the occasional presence of a second invigilator . The whole procedure took 15 - 25 minutes . After the sheets had been collected , a new discussion was held , this time with the aim of finding possible misconceptions and misunderstandings with respect to the target . In addition , students were invited to state their views orally , while the teacher made reference to the limitations of the analogy . A total of twenty - eight analogies was used , sixteen with tenth - grade students , and twelve with eleventh - grade students . The analogies were mainly between - domain , but some why - answering and some clarifying analogies were also given . Ten analogies had been suggested and used by one of the authors ( PS ) . The rest of the analogies were taken from various school books , as well as from the Applications and Analogies feature of the Journal of Chemical Education . All analogies were designed or modified so that the target was in agreement with the school curriculum , as well as to best meet the criteria of an effective analogy ( see the theoretical background ) .

It was hypothesised that the answer to each question could be facilitated ( for the experimental group ) by a corresponding analogy , while the control group had to invoke only their directly relevant chemical knowledge . The Appendix gives the five chemical questions under consideration . Four of these questions were numerical problems , and one was a conceptual question . The first three questions were set in tenth grade , and the remaining two in eleventh grade . We assumed that all five questions were moderately demanding , hence the comparison of the performances of the experimental and the control groups could inform us about the cognitive effect of the analogies . The end - of - year final examinations If the longitudinal use of analogies has a measurable effect , it must surely show up in the end - of - year examinations . Three mean marks from the end - of - year examinations will be considered : Examination 1 will represent the mean mark in all subjects except chemistry ; examination 2 will represent the mean mark in mathematics and physics , taken together ; and examination 3 is the chemistry examination . The end - of - year examinations took two hours for each subject , with the chemistry examination containing three items that were mainly knowledge questions , plus two numerical problems ( exercises ) . Students had to answer two knowledge questions and one problem . The marking in all subjects except chemistry was made by one teacher ; chemistry papers were marked by two teachers as previously . Pearson(cid:146)s r value was 0 . 80 for the tenth - grade chemistry examination , and 0 . 77 for the eleventh grade ( p < 0 . 01 ) . In making the comparisons of the end - of - year examinations , we must take into account that apart from the analogies , a number of (cid:145)chemical games(cid:146) as well as some pieces of historical information on some chemical concepts were used with the experimental group . ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY 39 Of necessity , their effect on the student achievement was integrated with that of the analogies . However , the following facts must also be considered : ( i ) Analogies were incorporated in most games ; ( ii ) the number of games , as well as of pieces of historical information was much smaller than the number of analogies ; and ( iii ) analogies alone made a considerably higher single contribution ( 28 . 3 % ) to the attainment of cognitive aims than games alone ( 5 . 8 % ) or historical information alone ( 11 . 1 % ) , as was found from students(cid:146) responses to a relevant questionnaire . Psychometric factors : developmental level and motivational style Finally , the effect of two psychometric factors was examined in this work ; developmental level in the Piaget sense , and student motivational style according to the four Adar categories ( Adar , 1969 ; Hofstein & Kempa , 1985 ; Kempa & Diaz , 1990a ) . Developmental level was judged by means of the Lawson paper - and - pencil test of formal reasoning ( Lawson , 1978 ) . The test consists of 15 items that examine the following cognitive abilities : weight conservation , volume conservation , numerical analogies , control of variables , combinations , and probabilities . Students had to justify their answers . One to five points were allocated , but only to correct answers , as follows : 5 points were allocated to completely justified answers ; 4 points to justified answers , but with errors in calculations ; 3 points to answers with insufficient justification ; 2 points to answers with unclear justification ; and 1 point to unjustified answers . Subjects with 0 - 25 points were classified as concrete ; with 21 - 50 points as transitional ( 2B / 3A ) , and with 51 - 75 points as formal . The marking of the answers to the Lawson test was made by two teachers , and Pearson(cid:146)s r values were 0 . 69 ( p < 0 . 01 ) for the tenth - grade sample , and 0 . 62 ( p < 0 . 01 ) for the eleventh - grade sample . In tenth grade , 24 . 3 % of the students were classified as late concrete ( 2B ) , 56 . 1 % as transitional ( 2B / 3A ) , and 19 . 6 % as early formal ( 3A ) . In eleventh grade , 22 . 4 % were 2B , 51 . 7 % were 2B / 3A , and 25 . 9 % were 3A . Note that all concrete students of our sample were late concrete ( 2B ) , while almost all formal subjects were early formal ( 3A ) ; the only two late formal students ( 3B ) were grouped with 3A . The above figures are within or close to the ranges reported by Shayer ( 1991 ) . Tenth - grade students(cid:146) motivational styles were judged by means of a simplified version of Adar(cid:146)s test material questionnaire ( Johnstone & Al - Naeme , 1995 ) that included 16 statements , four for each category of motivational style . The 16 items were partitioned equally into four subject areas : ( a ) work in classroom ; ( b ) work that requires information gathering from sources outside the school - books , as well as group - work in the laboratory ; ( c ) discovery learning ; and ( d ) social life . Students had to mark on the relevant sheet , the dominant view that was more relevant to them . The classification of each subject into one of the Adar categories was made according to the dominant view that was relevant to him or her , which resulted from summing his / her preferences for all four subject areas ( Johnstone & Al - Naeme , 1995 ) . In the few cases with no trait prevailing , students were asked to mark a secondary view . According to Kempa & Diaz ( 1990a ) , the classification of students in terms of the four motivational patterns does not imply that the patterns should be fully independent of each other ; actually , a certain degree of overlap between the traits was found , and in particular a very strong link between (cid:145)curiosity(cid:146) and (cid:145)consciousness(cid:146) . Consequently , the motivation to learn of many students stems from more than one source . The reliability of the answers was judged by having the subjects fill the same questionnaire twice , one at the start of the school year , the other after six months ( test - retest method ) . Ninety - one point two percent of the students were classified in the same category in both cases . Those who differed in the two cases , were deleted from the analysis . From the 148 tenth - grade students , 135 were SARANTOPOULOS & TSAPARLIS 40 sorted into distinct categories , of which 31 . 8 % were classified as conscientious , 45 . 9 % as curious , 19 . 3 % as sociable , and only 3 . 0 % ( 4 students ) as achievers . The distribution of these students into the experimental ( N = 73 ) and the control group ( N = 62 ) was as follows : conscientious , 24 ( 32 . 9 % ) versus 19 ( 30 . 6 % ) ; curious , 33 ( 45 . 2 % ) versus 29 ( 46 . 8 % ) ; sociable , 14 ( 19 . 2 % ) versus 12 ( 19 . 4 % ) ; and achievers , 2 ( 2 . 7 % ) versus 2 ( 3 . 2 % ) . All open answers were classified as either correct or wrong by two secondary teacher - chemists , according to : ( i ) their clarity , ( ii ) sufficient justification ( Zoller , 1995 ) , and ( iii ) correct calculations wherever they were required . For 89 . 9 % of the correct open answers of the tenth - grade experimental group and for 85 . 2 % of the correct open answers of the eleventh grade experimental group , there was agreement between the two markers . All answers for which there was disagreement between the two markers as to whether they were correct or wrong were discarded from the analysis . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Comparison of experimental and control group in chemical questions set immediately after each analogy was presented in class Table 3 has the data for this comparison . As a rule , formal students scored higher than transitional , and transitional students scored higher than concrete students . This is an expected result , since chemistry is a demanding subject with abstract concepts ( Herron , 1975 ; Shayer & Adey , 1981 ) . Now , in all five comparisons , there was an apparent outperformance of the experimental concrete students over the control concrete students . In addition , by comparing the answers of concrete students to the questions on the analogue and on the target domains , we have found a phrasal similarity , showing that concrete students of the experimental group did make use of the analogies . The effective use of analogies by the concrete students can be deduced also from their positive opinion with respect to the help offered by the analogies ( see below ) . From Table 3 , it is also obvious that there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the whole experimental group in four out of the five questions , with a similar trend for the fifth question . Some trend in favour of the experimental group was observed with the transitional students , while in the case of formal students there was neither a statistical significant difference nor a general trend . Although the results with formal students are not surprising , and demonstrate that these students were capable of functioning without the analogies , in accordance with the findings of Gabel and Sherwood ( 1980 ) , the very positive effect of the analogies in the case of concrete students is impressive and very encouraging . Achievement in the end - of - year final examinations ( i ) Comparison between the whole experimental and the whole control groups Table 4 has the mean percentage achievement in the end - of - year examinations of the whole experimental and control groups for both the tenth - and eleventh - grade samples . Although the differences on examinations 1 and 2 ( final examinations in all subjects except chemistry , and in mathematics plus physics , respectively ) were not statistically significant , for comparing the chemistry examinations we have carried out an analysis of covariance with examinations 1 and 2 as covariates . The differences in the chemistry examination was statistically significant for the tenth but not for the eleventh grade . ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY 41 TABLE 3 .

To see whether the above trends and findings characterize separately each of the two years of data collection , we examined the mean achievement in the three examinations for the two separate tenth - grade years .

We concentrate on the tenth grade because it provides a clearer case . In almost all examinations in both the experimental and the control group , formal students had higher achievement than transitional students ; similarly , transitional students outperformed concrete students .

ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY 43 lack of difference of the performance in examinations 1 and 2 demonstrates the equivalence of the experimental and the control groups . In all cases , students of the experimental group had superior achievement in the chemistry examination , although only in the case of transitional students the difference was statistically significant . In the case of the eleventh - grade sample ( data are not shown ) , the data were somehow obscure . To explain this , one could think of both negative ( discouraging ) and justifying reasons . On the negative side , students in eleventh grade might have become indifferent or even been worn out by the long use of analogies , so that the analogies became ineffective . On the other hand , a possible justification might be the fact that in eleventh grade , students as a rule , made a choice with respect to their future post - school careers . This preference was rather weak in tenth grade , but took a definite shape in eleventh grade . Thus , in the case of the concrete students of the eleventh grade , from the 13 concrete students of the control group , 6 students ( 46 . 2 % ) followed in the twelfth grade science - related study cycles , compared to only 2 out of 13 students ( 15 . 4 % ) of the experimental group . Affective factors It seems that apart from the positive effect that was traced above in connection with the cognitive objectives of teaching , analogies appealed to students from the affective perspective , especially towards satisfaction of the objectives of attendance and response . This conclusion derives firstly from the in - class observations of the teacher , where an active student participation in all stages of the educational process was realized ; and secondly from the students(cid:146) answers to the relevant item of the opinion questionnaire which was distributed in the end of the school year , with the students expressing on a five - point Lickert - type scale their positive or negative views about the used methodology . & In fact , for about half the students ( 52 . 2 % ) the reasons for their preference for the use of analogies were nearly evenly distributed into cognitive only ( 28 . 3 % ) and affective only ( 23 . 9 % ) , while the other half ( 47 . 8 % ) invoked mixed reasons ( cognitive and affective ) . Table 6 gives the percentage of positive opinions with respect to the help offered by analogies in the whole of the experimental group , as well as according to developmental level and motivational trait . It appears that concrete students were more positively disposed towards analogies . Turning now to the motivational styles , we note from Table 6 that curious students were more positive towards analogies than conscientious and sociable students . This is an expected finding , demonstrating the importance for the curious student of the constructivist learning environment , such as that offered in this work through the use of analogies . Note that as has been reported ( Kempa & Diaz , 1990b ) , curious students prefer to engage actively in their educational process through various activities ( for example , discovery learning ) , while they do not like to be passive receivers or listeners ( as in formal teaching ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ & Among cognitive reasons were assumed answers like (cid:147) ( the methodology / the analogies ) helped me understand the difficult chemistry concepts , or helped in chemistry problem solving(cid:148) . Among affective reasons were assumed answers like (cid:147) ( the methodology / the analogies ) made the lesson interesting , or made the lesson amusing , or provided a break to the monotonous flow of chemical concepts .

Attitude of students Here are representative positive and negative comments from students on the teaching methodology . Positive comments • (cid:147)Despite the fact that I had never had difficulty in understanding anything from any teacher , I am convinced that through this methodology many students are getting help . In addition , I was provided with the chance to understand and remember everything , by invoking the analogies . (cid:148) ( male student , formal , sociable ) • (cid:147)The methodology helped me a lot . It was quite unusual for me , and I feel sorry that such a methodology had not been used in my earlier chemistry courses . (cid:148) ( male student , formal , curious ) . • (cid:147)The methodology has succeeded in turning a difficult and boring subject into an entertaining and understandable one . Carry on , we have a lot to benefit . (cid:148) ( female student , formal , curious ) • (cid:147)The lessons were delivered in a very unusual and constructive way , and have helped me to understand chemistry , more than in any previous year . (cid:148) ( female student , transitional , sociable ) • (cid:147)The teaching methodology has made me love chemistry . My performance was higher than previous years . (cid:148) ( female student , transitional , curious ) • (cid:147)During all years I was taught chemistry , I had never understood anything . That was the reason I was not interested in chemistry . This year , however , thanks to the methodology and the way the lessons were manipulated , I feel that I have learnt , if not many , at least some elements of chemistry . (cid:148) ( female student , transitional , conscientious ) . • (cid:147)I think that the methodology was very good and unusual , and helped students understand chemistry . Even for those who did not like chemistry , I think that the methodology had changed them , because the lessons were interesting and never boring . (cid:148) ( female student , transitional , conscientious ) . • (cid:147)Despite the fact that chemistry is not among the subjects that will be useful in my post - school studies , this method has helped me to keep in my mind certain things that otherwise it is likely that I would not remember . (cid:148) ( female student , concrete , curious ) • (cid:147)I always had a problem with chemistry because I could not recall formulas , valences , ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY 45 symbols , etc . Nevertheless , with the analogies I managed to overcome this problem , and as result I don(cid:146)t run the risk of failing this subject . (cid:148) ( male student , concrete , sociable ) • (cid:147)The teaching methodology has made me think seriously about choosing chemistry instead of mathematics . (cid:148) ( female student , concrete , curious ) Negative comments • (cid:147)I did not like the way lessons were made . I believe that the lectures should be carried out only with purely chemical terms , not with analogies , because only chemical questions are given in the examinations . (cid:148) ( female student , concrete , conscientious ) . • (cid:147)I should have preferred the lessons to be the standard ones , for the methodology confused me at some times . (cid:148) ( male student , transitional , curious ) • (cid:147)I think that the lecture should follow the way it is written in the book , for it is the book that I have to study at home . (cid:148) ( female student , transitional , curious ) • (cid:147)The analogies made us lose time from the standard lessons . (cid:148) ( male student , transitional , sociable ) CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INSTRUCTION This paper has summarised a longitudinal study involving the use of socially - related analogies in the teaching of school chemistry , and its relationship to performance and student attitude . It was demonstrated that gains were observed . However , at the outset , we should issue a cautionary warning . A problem which characterises all this kind of work is being able to control variables tightly , and then being able to attribute outcomes to specific inputs ; that is , it is difficult to isolate clearly the effect of the analogies from the social and the student enjoyment factors . A counter - argument to this is that the social and enjoyment factors constitute an integral part of using analogies such as those employed in this study . Social relevance is a very important factor , suggesting that there must be educational gains from this on its own , without any specific use of analogies . It is possible then that this is at least part of the effect we are observing . On the other hand , the analogies were often fun for the students , turning the lessons into (cid:147)interesting and never boring(cid:148) sessions . Enjoyment is a very important factor in effective learning , and this may be a major contributor too . It is possible then that the observed gains are not simply and directly attributable to the use of analogies . Some of the quoted student comments would certainly favor the analogies , while some would support the increased enjoyment argument , and some would support the social relevance aspect . Relevant to the above discussion is the Award Address by Zafra M . Lerman , published in the November 2003 issue of the Journal of Chemical Education ( Lerman , 2003 ) . The author describes how she communicates chemistry effectively , and gives arguments and evidence that support the efficiency of her method . According to Lerman , the arts ( music , dance , drama , and fine arts ) are excellent vehicles for enhancing understanding : (cid:147)For example , most people are not interested in the concept of the ionic bond , but when presented as a love story between Sodium and Chlorine like Shakespeare(cid:146)s Romeo and Juliet , people enjoy learning about the bonding relationship(cid:133) The same is true for students who (cid:133) (cid:147)danced (cid:145)The Three States of Matter(cid:146) . (cid:148) ( p . 1234 ) There is no doubt that Lerman uses a multitude of instructional tools , and that the social and enjoyment factors play a dominant role . Equally , there is no doubt that analogies play a SARANTOPOULOS & TSAPARLIS 46 central role in her methodology . The most important finding of this work was that analogies can be more effective for lower cognitive development students . Concrete students who were taught the analogies scored much higher than control - group concrete students on demanding questions ( four problems and a conceptual question - see the Appendix ) . The opinion of Sutala and Krajcik ( 1988 ) is thus confirmed that students of low cognitive ability benefit from the analogies and have good results when they enjoy the help of the teacher in making the analogical connection . On the other hand , we have provided evidence that formal students ( in the Piaget sense ) can be successful without the need of analogies , in agreement with Gabel and Sherwood ( 1980 ) . However , the usefulness of the analogies to both transitional and formal students cannot be ruled out , as can be judged from both the wording of their answers and their positive views towards analogies . The above finding seems to come into conflict with the view of Enyeart ( cited in Duit , 1991 ) that there is no connection between the use of analogies and developmental level . We must take into account , however , that Enyeart refers to the personal analogies used by students , not to the instructional use of analogies . On the other hand , the fact that concrete students can benefit from analogies seems to come into conflict with Piagetian theory , according to which these students are not capable of using analogical reasoning . However , Piaget is referring to spontaneous and personal analogies . We had instructional use of analogies , whereby we enforced students to see and examine new knowledge through the correspondences ; at the same time , we provided allusions as to how to think , and showed the path to the answer , so important to the concrete student . Note that the one - to - one correspondence is an ability that has been established with concrete operations . In addition , the importance of allusions that contribute to the effective instructional use of analogies has been pointed by a number of workers ( Reed , Ernst & Banerji , 1974 ; Hays & Tierney 1982 ; Tenney & Gentner , 1985 ; Glyn et al . , 1989 , p . 392 ) . Thus , while the spontaneous use of analogies is common in everyday life and in problem solving , the fruitful use of analogies by teachers and learning media requires considerable guidance ( Duit , 1991 ) . From the affective perspective , we have demonstrated that analogies have a positive effect for most students . Developmental level , as well as motivational trait , both play a definitive role here , with the concrete students on the one hand , and the curious students on the other being more favourably disposed towards the use of analogies in teaching . Considering the implications for instruction , analogies should be used only when they contribute significantly to acquiring new concepts and processes . Thus the use of analogies is linked with the difficulty of the target domain for the learner . Analogies should be , and are used as an aid to understanding when the target is difficult to understand ( Royer & Cable , 1976 ) . Similarly , in the case of problem solving , the target problem must be sufficiently novel and challenging ( Gick & Holyoak , 1983 ) . Needless to add that time constraints make it difficult to advocate a massive use of chemical analogies , as was done in this work . A careful selection of analogies has then to be made . We must check each analogy for both its effectiveness and its limitations . The analogies should meet all requirements for an effective analogy . Most importantly , the analogue domain has to be familiar to the students . It is this fundamental requirement that is met by analogies with a social content . It is further desirable to use analogies in a constructivist manner ( Black & Solomon , 1987 ) , through the provision to the students , for instance , of the structural correspondences between the analogue and the target , a method used here . The information - processing demand of the analogies should also be carefully controlled . Last but not least , we must warn students about the possible misconceptions associated with each analogy . Although multiple analogies may help avoid the ANALOGIES IN CHEMISTRY TEACHING : A LONGITUDINAL STUDY 47 misconceptions caused by a single analogy , and so function as (cid:147)antidotes for analogy - induced misconceptions(cid:148) ( Spiro et al . , 1989 ) , we must take into account that multiple analogies demand multiple teaching ( and learning ) time . NOTE : Preliminary results of this work have been previously presented in two European conferences ( Tsaparlis & Sarantopoulos , 1993 , 1995 ) . NOTE ADDED IN PROOF : A paper published in the current issue of this journal ( Orgill & Bodner , 2004 ) deals with the use of analogies in chemistry teaching and reviews the relevant literature . In addition , the authors interviewed biochemistry students about the analogies that were used in their classes , and found that most students liked , paid particular attention to , and remembered the analogies their instructors provided . The paper includes students(cid:146) suggestions for improving the use of analogies in class . ACKNOWLEDGEMENT : We thank one reviewer ( Dr . Norman Reid ) for the critical comments regarding the difficulty of distinguishing the effect of the analogies from that of the social and enjoyment factors . These comments have been incorporated in the conclusions , and would certainly contribute to the critical appraisal of our findings . We also thank Dr . Michael Gagan for reading the final version of the manuscript and making suggestions for improvements .

Question after analogy # 15 ( Determining the density at a rally of a political party ) In 250 mL of solution (cid:145)A(cid:146) 60 g of NaCl are contained , while in 150 mL of solution (cid:145)B(cid:146) 42 g of NaCl are contained . Which solution is more concentrated ? Question after analogy # 16 [ Concentration calculations ( the calculation of the monthly income of a married couple ) : Lubeck , 1983 ] 11 . 2 L of a 0 . 5 M glucose solution were mixed with 0 . 8 L of a 0 . 45 M glucose solution . Calculate the total number of moles of glucose that were present in the final solution . Question after analogy # 19 ( A bloody nose : Last , 1983 ) Consider the reaction 2AB A 2 + B 2 . Which of the following collisions can lead to the formation of products ? Question after analogy # 23 ( Dancing couples : Last , 1983 ) 11 mol HCl plus 9 mol NH 3 were brought inside a closed reaction vessel . After chemical equilibrium was established , 3 mol NH 3 were found to be present in the vessel . What was the yield of the chemical reaction ? Question after analogy # 24 ( A hypothetical coffee vending machine : McMinn , 1984 ) In a reaction vessel , 2 . 5 moles of carbon plus 7 moles of hydrogen were placed . After the chemical equilibrium C + 2H 2 CH 4 was established , it was found that 1 . 5 moles of methane were produced . What was the reaction yield ? How many moles of carbon or / and hydrogen remained in the vessel ?
