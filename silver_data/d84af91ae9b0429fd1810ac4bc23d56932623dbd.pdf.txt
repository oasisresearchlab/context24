Crumbliss Chemistry Department , Duke University , Durham , NC , United States A novel approach to the description of the assembly mechanism of functional biological structures is presented . The approach is based on the identiﬁcation of fundamental self - assembling processes to which an additional structurization “engineered” by Nature to optimize functions is superimposed . Application of the approach to the structure and contraction of the striated muscle evidences a key role of the residual liquid crystallinity of a constrained structure and the alteration of the compatibility between the thin and thick ﬁlaments driven by ionic interactions . ATP hydrolysis boosts the relaxation process . A strong protein scaffold , engineered during the evolutionary process and based on the selective anchoring of coordinated ﬁlaments , directs a demixing tendency of the two ﬁlaments toward a sliding motion along the ﬁber axis . The Huxley - Hanson sliding ﬁlament hypothesis aimed to explain the contraction - relaxation function of the striated muscle , but does not offer any clue on the overall assembling mechanism of the myoﬁbril . Keywords : striated muscle , self - assembly , actin , myosin , titin , sarcomers INTRODUCTION The assembly processes of all structures , molecular , or macroscopic ones , must conform to the criteria of shape and chemical compatibility of the building blocks . The former arises from the geometrical shape , and the second from chemical or supramolecular interactions between the components . These two criteria are the basis of current self - assembling theories and are often referred to as shape and chemical recognition or , alternatively , as hard and soft interactions ( Ciferri , 2002 , 2005 ; Lehn , 2002 ) . A recent article has highlighted the translation of molecular order to the macroscopic level for several classes of synthetic and natural macrostructures ( Ciferri , 2016a ) . It was concluded that fundamental self - assembling treatments , such as molecular and supramolecular liquid crystallinity ( Flory , 1984 ; Khokhlov and Semenov , 1985 ; Khokhlov , 1991 ; Odijk , 1996 ; Ciferri , 2004 ) and supramolecular polymerization ( van der Schoot , 2005 ) , describe the occurrence of macroscopically - ordered model polymers . In the case of biological systems , the contribution of basic assembling mechanisms was readily evidenced in relatively simple cases . For instance , in the case of the collagen ﬁbrillogenesis , the geometrical parameters of the growing ﬁlaments promoted linear assembly driven by liquid crystallinity ( Ciferri , 2016a ) . Nevertheless , even in such a simple case , the ﬁber structure included modiﬁcations “engineered” by Nature for speciﬁc functions of collagen ﬁbers . When particularly thin ﬁbers are needed ( for instance collagen II that reinforces the vitreous structure of the eye ) , lateral growth is blocked by decoration of the ﬁber lateral surface with collagen type IX during some stage of the polymerization ( Ciferri , 2016a ) . The objective of the present work is to identify the basic self - assembling mechanism and associated engineered modiﬁcations used by Nature to produce even more complex functional Ciferri and Crumbliss The Assembling and Contraction Mechanisms of Striated Muscles systems . Striated muscles , particularly the cardiac one , exhibit a static and a dynamic function . For the past 50 years , the dynamic function of the contraction has been interpreted by the Huxley - Hanson sliding ﬁlament model ( Hanson and Huxley , 1953 ; Szent - Györgyi , 2004 ; Huxley , 2014 ) . This model is based on a structural analysis by X ray diﬀraction and does not account for recent developments regarding the phase behavior of rigid polymers and ion - polyelectrolyte interaction . STRIATED MUSCLES AND THE HUXLEY - HANSON MODEL Striated muscles have a relatively simple morphology with no bends or curvatures but exhibit large complexity in the organization of their main molecular constituents : actin , myosin , titin , and numerous minor components , all of which form the contractile sarcomer cell schematized in Figure 1A in the contracted state . Linear assembly of sarcomers produce the myoﬁbril that further aggregate into myoﬁbers , ( Cooper , 2000 ; Gregorio and Antin , 2000a , b ) . Titin , bound to myosin in the thick ﬁlament , is a giant protein that might include up to 33 , 000 amino acids , with an extended length exceeding 1 micrometer that spans the length of the sarcometer ( Lee et al . , 2007 ; Hsin et al . , 2011 ) . Its tertiary structure is characterized by 244 partially structured domains connected by unstructured sequences . Titin elasticity assists the recovery of the rest length following muscular contraction . It has been interpreted in terms of entropic contributions of the unstructured sequences , and the unfolding of the structured domains ( Lee et al . , 2007 ; Hsin et al . , 2011 ) . Thick and thin ﬁlaments within the sarcomer interdigitate in a hexagonal patterns where each thick ﬁlament is surrounded by six thin ones ( Figures 1B , C ) ( Cooper , 2000 ; Gregorio and Antin , 2000a , b ) . During contraction , calcium ions travel from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the sarcomeric cell following signals from motor neurons ( Ca + + concentration increases from ca . 10 − 7 to 10 − 5 M ) . Consistently with the sliding ﬁlament model originally proposed by Hanson , a weak interaction , ambiguously deﬁned as “salt bridges” links the thin and the tick ﬁlaments . This binding allows the thin ﬁlament to be pushed toward the center of the sarcomer , causing its shortening and muscle contraction . During relaxation , the salt bridge is dissociated and calcium ions are pushed back to the reticulum . Recognizing the weakness of the salt bridges ( Bosshard et al . , 2004 ) , Huxley contributed the idea of a direct link between the thick and the thin ﬁlament . His swinging cross - bridge model includes ATP hydrolysis , which displaces calcium ions and induces conformational changes in the myosin head of the thick ﬁlament . According to his model , calcium ions expose binding sites on troponin and tropomyosin ( linked to actin in the thin ﬁlament ) , promoting their binding to the myosin heads . Binding of consecutive molecules of ATP assists the sliding of myosin by “grabbing and swiveling” along the thin ﬁlament . In the absence of calcium ions , a change in the conﬁguration of troponin and tropomyosin inhibits the binding of the myosin heads , and relaxation occurs . Luther and Squire have discussed ﬁner details regarding how the rotation of the myosin - titin ﬁlaments around their long axes inﬂuences the interaction with neighboring actin ﬁlaments ( Luther and Squire , 2014 ) . ANALYSIS OF SELF - ASSEMBLING CONTRIBUTIONS Two main self - assembling features emerge from the appreciation of the chemical composition of the constituent polymers and their spatial orientation . The ﬁrst remarkable feature is a soft interaction contribution due to the polyelectrolyte character of the constituent polymers ( Pearstone et al . , 1976 ; Raszkowski et al . , 1977 ; Manning , 1978 ; Stone and Smillie , 1978 ; Maruyama et al . , 1981 ; Yang and Janmey , 1996 ; Xian et al . , 1999 ) . The data of Raszkowski et al show that the anionic charge grossly outweighs the cationic one ( for myosin : Glu + Asp = 227 , Lys + Arg + Hist = 130 ; for actin : Glu + Asp = 110 , Lys + Arg + His = 65 gmol / 10 5 g protein ) ( Raszkowski et al . , 1977 ) . A similar conclusion is obtained from the sequence studies for tropomiosin ( Stone and Smillie , 1978 ) and troponin ( Pearstone et al . , 1976 ) ( that bind to actin ) , and titin ( Maruyama et al . , 1981 ) ( that binds to myosin ) . These studies reveal that the sarcomeric polymers are all weak polyanions , and therefore programmed to be mutually repulsive unless the ﬁxed anionic charges are connected by the hypothetical “salt bridge , ” as claimed by the sliding ﬁlament model , or screened by interaction with mobile ions ( Manning , 1978 ; Yang and Janmey , 1996 ; Xian et al . , 1999 ; Ciferri and Perico , 2010 ; Ciferri , 2012a ; Crumbliss and Parker Siburt , 2012 ; Maglio et al . , 2012 ) . The latter possibility has not been previously considered , but should not be neglected . In fact , even though the Debye screening length is rather small in a 10 − 5 M solution of a conventional electrolyte , calcium ions have a speciﬁc binding power that greatly reinforces the simple Debye screening ( Ciferri and Perico , 2010 ; Ciferri , 2012a ; Maglio et al . , 2012 ) . It should moreover be remarked that current polyelectrolyte theory predicts the occurrence of “condensed” bivalent cations that are free to diﬀuse along the chain axis but unable to diﬀuse away ( Manning , 1978 ; Yang and Janmey , 1996 ; Xian et al . , 1999 ) . In addition to a reduced electrostatic repulsion between ﬁxed charges , the ion condensation actually promotes an attractive interaction between chains sharing counter - ions . Condensation eﬀects are predicted to occur above a critical value of charge density , deﬁned by the ratio of the Bjerrum length to the linear charge spacing . The charge density calculated for F - actin in the presence of magnesium ions exceeded the critical value , suggesting signiﬁcant condensation eﬀects . A contribution to the stabilization of the interdigitated state of the present system is anticipated , but its quantitative evaluation would be problematic . The second remarkable feature is the hard interaction contribution evidenced by the ordered hexagonal distribution of thick and thin ﬁlament in the contracted state , which is suggestive of a liquid crystalline assembly ( Flory , 1984 ; Khokhlov and Semenov , 1985 ; Khokhlov , 1991 ; Odijk , 1996 ; Ciferri , 2004 ) . Liquid crystalline structures evolving into smectic , hexagonal mesophases are predicted and observed for solutions of rigid polymers having persistence length above ∼ 50 Å , or axial ratio X Frontiers in Chemistry | www . frontiersin . org 2 November 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 570 Ciferri and Crumbliss The Assembling and Contraction Mechanisms of Striated Muscles FIGURE 1 | ( A ) Schematization of the structure of a sarcomer in the contracted state based on high resolution optical microscopy . The Z lines limit the length of each repeating sarcomer along a myoﬁbril . The thin ﬁlaments are based on rigid actin molecules with bound tropomyosin and troponin .

The thick ﬁlaments ) are ﬁrmly anchored to the central M zone and are based on rigid myosin bound to three to six tinin molecules . The N - terminals of ﬂexible segments of titin connect each thick ﬁlament to the Z region , from which subsequent sarcomeric units depart . The terminal C - sections of titin stabilize opposite half - sarcomers overlaps in the central M zone .

( length / diameter ) as small as ∼ 3 ( Flory , 1984 ) . The reduction of excluded volume within the ordered conﬁguration is the driving force for the thermodynamic stabilization of the mesophase at a critical concentration , v c , inversely related to the axial ratio of the mesogen ( Khokhlov , 1991 ) : v c ∼ 3 / X ( 1 ) . The lattice treatment evidences that the formation of an ordered mesophase will occur with rigid molecules , as well as with macroscopic rods ( Flory , 1984 ) . In the case of the muscle ﬁlaments , growth may radially occur within each sarcomer . Actin has one of the largest persistent lengths so far reported , exceeding 1 micrometer ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ) . However , there are not suﬃcient data to assess the persistence length of the complexes of interest here . Nevertheless , the axial ratios of the thin and thick segments , which can be tentatively estimated from the average length of the sarcometer ( Figure 1A ) and the ﬁlament diameters [ 7 and 15 nm , respectively ( Cooper , 2000 ; Gregorio and Antin , 2000a , b ) ] , appear to be in the order of 30 . Therefore , in terms of Equation ( 1 ) , an ordered mesophase will necessarily develop in solutions above v ∼ 0 , 10 of either the actin or myosin complexes ( total protein content in the sarcomer is in the order of 20 % ) . Their mixtures will also produce a single mesophase since rigid polymers are predicted to be mutually compatible in ternary solutions displaying athermal or negligible soft interaction between the two solutes ( when the Flory - Huggins parameter for the free energy of dilution χ 2 , 3 is close to zero ) ( Flory , 1984 ) . Alternatively stated , shape compatibility drives the mixing of two mesogens in the absence of any attractive or repulsive soft interaction . A single mesophase is commonly observed with mixtures of low molecular weight liquid crystals when the mesophase is stabilized by anisotropic , attractive soft interactions . Flexible segments , occurring within a prevalently rigid molecule , are excluded from the mesophase ( Flory , 1984 ; Khokhlov and Semenov , 1985 ; Khokhlov , 1991 ) . This situation is consistent with to the disordered elastic sections of titin outside the overlap region . The above analysis pertains to the case of contracted muscles , when electrostatic repulsion is screened out by calcium ions . Liquid crystalline polyelectrolytes should instead be relevant to the case of the relaxed muscle . Although more detailed experimental or simulation evidence is desirable , the occurrence of the net anionic charge is expected to introduce repulsion Frontiers in Chemistry | www . frontiersin . org 3 November 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 570 Ciferri and Crumbliss The Assembling and Contraction Mechanisms of Striated Muscles among the rods , distortions and destabilization of the ordered mesophase . Twisting eﬀects have been described for solutions of a single polymer or polymer mixtures ( Nyrkova and Khokhlov , 1986 ; Odijk , 1996 ; Ciferri , 2004 ) . Studies on ternary mixtures of rigid polymers displaying soft repulsive interactions ( hence poor chemical compatibility and χ 2 , 3 parameters > 0 ) were reported in the literature of the 1980s . Most systems exhibited demixing into two liquid crystalline phases having diﬀerent order parameters ( Marsano et al . , 1984 ; Sasaki et al . , 1988 ; Maissa and Sixou , 1989 ; Ciferri , 1991 ) . Therefore , It is postulated here that a demixing tendency of two anionic polymers is manifested when their ﬁxed anionic charges are unscreened . A direct veriﬁcation of the above postulate for the systems considered here would oﬀer additional support to our model . More recent data indicate that compositional segregation eﬀects are also triggered by the presence of a cylindrical body with perpendicular anchoring ( Rahini , 2017 ) . ENGINEERING THE SARCOMERS The foregoing analysis applies to solutions of the unrestricted actin and myosin components . In the sarcomer , however , opposite half units are strongly bound , and the relative orientation of myosin and actin ﬁlaments remains the same on both halves of the sarcomer . Anchoring of the ﬁlaments appears to be the primary “engineered” strategy used by Nature to produce a one - dimensional motion based on the interpenetration of the two set of ﬁlaments . The most interesting strategy is the anchoring of the thick ﬁlaments to the M zone , resulting in the interpenetration of the thin rods from two opposite directions , thus magnifying the contraction - relaxation dimensional change . Another fundamental strategy is the anchoring of several thin segments to the Z zone ( Figure 1B ) so that a ﬁx spacing between the ﬁlaments is assured , a coordinated displacement of several ﬁlaments is achieved , and the contraction - relaxation motion involves the whole sarcometer . The latter situation parallels the case of liquid crystals anchored to a surface , which have been extensively investigated due to their great technological relevance ( Marrucci and Ciferri , 1977 ; Ciferri , 2012b ) . Anchoring results in a further restriction to the lateral displacement of the ﬁrst layer of anchored molecules . The net results of the above combined strategies is that only the motion along the ﬁbrillar axis is allowed . The combined role of the calcium ions and of the anchorage is better appreciated by considering that the typical morphology of an unrestricted liquid crystal is based on multi - domain regions ( size ca 1 micrometer ) that have similar order parameter , but random director orientation ( Marrucci and Ciferri , 1977 ; Ciferri , 2012b ) . Under these conditions , the postulated demixing would not be coordinated along any speciﬁc direction . The engineered anchorage of the ﬁlaments within the sarcomer reproduces instead the situation of a single liquid crystal and allows a coordinated dimensional change restricted to the myoﬁbril axis ( Marrucci and Ciferri , 1977 ; Ciferri , 2012b ) . The early stage of myoﬁbrillogenesis have been documented by electron microscopy in embryonic material ( Cooper , 2000 ; Gregorio and Antin , 2000a , b ) . During the earliest growth stage , the protein components are randomly dispersed within the cytoplasm . Thereafter , precursors of the Z zone appear , accumulate along the membrane and form complexes with actin and alfa - actinin . During the following stage , complexes of myosin - titin are formed and become localized along the M line . These thick ﬁlaments assume their ﬁnal orientation before the thin ones . These observations were considered insuﬃcient to explain the selective localization of the components . The occurrence of a template was indeed postulated ( Cooper , 2000 ; Gregorio and Antin , 2000a , b ) . However , the above observations are consistent with a primary liquid crystalline orientation of the thick segments anchored along the ﬁbrillar axis , followed by the interdigitation of thin segments that become ﬁrmly anchored to the membrane , consistently with an hexagonal topology . The role of ATP in reducing the polymer - salt interaction is that of a booster of the relaxation process in both models . Additional support for the booster role of ATP comes from the development of the extreme rigidity ( rigor mortis ) manifested by striated muscles when vital functions cease ( Jerôme , 1991 ) . It is known that this situation is accompanied by an increase of the concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol , promoted by deterioration of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum and compounded by the absence of ATP , which no longer contributes to the rupture of calcium bridges 1 . The diﬀerence between our model and the Huxley - Hanson one is particularly evident in the case of the contraction step . In the latter model , the stabilization of the contracted state is based on the perplexing hypothesis that myosin ﬁlaments make discrete steps on actin , or to hypothetical salt bridges . In our model , the main driving force for the contracted state is the basic entropic contribution that drives the athermal mixing of two shape - compatible mesogens within a single liquid crystalline phase ( Flory , 1984 ; Khokhlov and Semenov , 1985 ; Khokhlov , 1991 ) , possibly enhanced by the parallelizing eﬀect of ion condensation ( Manning , 1978 ; Yang and Janmey , 1996 ; Xian et al . , 1999 ) . In both models , the relaxed conﬁguration is promoted by the removal of calcium ions , but our model emphasizes the prevailing of an enthalpic contribution arising from the r epulsion of the anionic charges . There is only partial conjectural evidence for the swinging cross bridge model , which is a however a useful concept in cell motility ( Mitchinson and Cramer , 1996 ) . On the other hand , there is compelling evidence for the role of liquid crystalline order on the organization of functional strucures ( Marsano et al . , 1984 ; Sasaki et al . , 1988 ; Maissa and Sixou , 1989 ; Ciferri , 1991 , 2016a , b ) . It is therefore possible to suggest that the sarcomer retains a memory of the interdigitated liquid crystalline distribution of the unrestricted components formed during the earlier development stages . When the ﬁxed charges on both ﬁlaments are screened out ( contracted state ) , full interdigitation is allowed , in line with theoretical predictions for mixtures of two compatible rods ( Flory , 1984 ; Khokhlov and Semenov , 1985 ; Khokhlov , 1991 ) . However , when the ionic strength of calcium ions is reduced 1 Rigor mortis . Wikipedia Frontiers in Chemistry | www . frontiersin . org 4 November 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 570 Ciferri and Crumbliss The Assembling and Contraction Mechanisms of Striated Muscles ( relaxed state ) , the increased electrostatic repulsion of ﬁxed charges , coupled with the engineered anchorage of the ﬁlaments , will trigger demixing and the linear expulsion of the coordinated thin ﬁlaments from the interdigitated conﬁguration ( Marsano et al . , 1984 ; Sasaki et al . , 1988 ; Maissa and Sixou , 1989 ; Ciferri , 1991 ) . It needs to be pointed out that in addition to a new interpretation of muscular contraction , our model allows an interpretation of the sarcomeric structure based on the superimposition of supramolecular assembling mechanisms to engineered anchorages . Similar approaches might allow the elucidation of even more complex assembly mechanisms of other functional biostructures . Moreover , new guidelines are now suggested to the material scientists attempting to mimic the functions of natural systems .
