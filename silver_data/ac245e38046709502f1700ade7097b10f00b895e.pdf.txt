Antimicrobial peptides generated in response to bacterial infection play a pivotal role in the ﬁrst line of host defense systems against the invasion of pathogens . These peptides possess bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of microbes , including Gram - positive bacteria , Gram - negative bacteria , fungi , and certain viruses . 1 ) Cathelicidins , which are one of the major antimicrobial peptide families , are com - posed of the cathelin domain and the C - terminal antimicro - bial domain . 2 ) The cathelin domain is highly conserved , but the C - terminal antimicrobial domain is a less conserved peptide that corresponds to mature antimicrobial peptides . 2 ) Among cathelicidin family members found in various mam - mals , only one cathelicidin , hCAP18 ( human cationic anti - bacterial protein of 18 kDa ) , has been found in humans . hCAP18 has 37 amino acid residues , termed LL - 37 , which are responsible for the antimicrobial effect at its C - terminal . 3 ) In addition to its bactericidal activity , LL - 37 is a chemo - attractant for immune and inﬂammation cells , including T cells , neutrophils , monocytes , and mast cells . 4 , 5 ) Thus , it ap - pears that LL - 37 may serve not only as a bactericidal sub - stance but also as an alarm signal when pathogens invade . Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) expressed on various types of immune cells also play a pivotal role in innate immunity . TLR1 , TLR2 , TLR4 , TLR5 , and TLR9 are especially impor - tant for host defense against bacteria because these TLRs recognize bacterial components and then promote cytokine secretion . 6 ) Mast cells express functional TLRs 7—10 ) and con - tribute to host defense or the initiation of an innate immune response by releasing cytokines and chemokines following TLR stimulation . 11—14 ) For example , the W / W v mouse , a mast cell - deﬁcient mouse , has an increased incidence of mortality from cecal ligation and puncture ; however , the increased mortality is reduced in mast cell - reconstituted W / W v mice . Mast cell - derived TNF - a released after TLR4 stimulation may contribute to this attenuated mortality . 11 , 15 ) Mast cells are located in the epithelial tissue in which LL - 37 is generated ; therefore , it is possible that LL - 37 sends an alarm signal to mast cells to reinforce the body’s defenses against infectious disease . In the present study , we demon - strate that LL - 37 up - regulates both TLR4 mRNA and protein expression , and observed that LL - 37 induced the release of Th2 - type cytokines and pro - inﬂammatory cytokine from mast cells . Further , the increased expression of Th2 cy - tokines selectively diminished by LPS treatment . These ob - servations may indicate that LL - 37 is a candidate modiﬁer of the host defense against bacterial entry by serving as an alarm for sentinels such as mast cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture The LAD2 human mast cell line was main - tained in StemPro - 34 serum - free medium ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY , U . S . A . ) supplemented with StemPro nutrient supplement ( 13 ml / 500 ml ; Gibco ) , penicillin – streptomycin ( 1 : 100 ; Gibco ) , 2 m M L - glutamine ( Gibco ) , and 0 . 1 m g / ml of human stem cell factor ( PeproTech Inc . , Rocky Hill , NJ , U . S . A . ) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . The culture media was replaced every 2 weeks , and the cells were used after at least 3 d of culture . bb - Hexosaminidase ( Hex ) Release Assay LAD2 mast cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of LL - 37 ( HyCult Biotechnology , Uden , Netherlands ) for 30 min at 37 °C .

Received November 7 , 2007 ; accepted November 29 , 2007 ; published online November 30 , 2007 The antimicrobial peptide LL - 37 is generated from skin keratinocytes during infection of Gram - negative bacteria and exerts a microbicidal effect . LL - 37 also causes functional changes in mast cells . Mast cells in the skin are involved in the innate immune system response against microbial infections via Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , such as TLR4 , which that is known to recognize lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , a bacterial component . Thus , in the present study , we examined the effects of LL - 37 on the expression of TLRs and the generation of cytokines on mast cells , and considered functional changes in the host defense system against bacteria . We observed that LL - 37 increased the level of TLR4 mRNA and TLR4 protein , and that LL - 37 induced the release of IL - 4 , IL - 5 and IL - 1 bb from mast cells . Cross - interaction between LL - 37 - triggered TLR4 augmentation and LL - 37 - inducible cytokine generation was also examined . Although the up - regulation of LL - 37 - inducible Th2 cytokines was can - celled by LPS , the augmentation of pro - inﬂammatory cytokine production was still observed . These ﬁndings in - dicate that LL - 37 co - existing with the bacterial component switches mast cell function and directs human mast cells toward innate immunity . In conclusion , LL - 37 may be a candidate modiﬁer of the host defense against bac - terial entry by serving as an alarm for sentinels such as mast cells .

HRP - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( for TLR2 , TLR5 , TLR9 , phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 , ERK1 , phos - phorylated p38 , and p38 ) and HRP - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG ( for TLR1 and TLR4 ) were purchased from Amersham Bioscience and used as secondary Abs . For the detection of TLR2 , TLR4 , TLR5 , ERK , and p38 , LAD2 cells were lysed in a mixture of protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) , NuPAGE sample reduction agent ( Invitrogen ) , and NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer ( Invitrogen ) and then heated for 10 min at 70 °C . Protein extracts were separated on NuPAGE 4—12 % Bis - Tris gels ( Invitrogen ) and then transferred onto a nitro - cellulose or polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane ( Invitro - gen ) . Western blotting was performed according to the in - structions for the Immobilon detection reagents ( Millipore Corp . , Billerca , MA , U . S . A . ) . Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an LAS - 1000 imaging system ( Fujiﬁlm , Tokyo ) . Isolation of RNA and Generation of cDNA by Reverse Transcription TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) was used to isolate total RNA from LAD2 cells incubated in culture medium with or without 1 m g / ml LL - 37 for 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 or 24 h . Isolated RNA was puriﬁed using an RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , U . S . A . ) and was reverse - transcribed to cDNA . For each reaction , 2 m g of RNA was diluted to 11 m l with UltraPure distilled water ( Gibco ) and mixed with 1 m l of oligo ( dT ) 12—18 primer ( Invitrogen ) and 1 m l of 10 m M dNTP mix ( Invitro - gen ) , heated to 65 °C for 5 min , and quickly chilled on ice .

To each reaction , 1 m l of SuperScript II RNase H (cid:4) Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) was added , and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 42 °C . Finally , each reaction was mixed with 0 . 5 m l of RNase H ( Invitrogen ) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C . Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - PCR ) PCR was carried out using AccuPrime SuperMix I ( Invitrogen ) . Ampliﬁcation was carried out for the following number of cycles : 48 for formylpeptide receptor like 1 ( FPRL1 ) and P2X 7 , and 25 for b - actin . Each cycle included denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C , annealing for 30 s ( 63 °C for FPRL1 , 57 °C for P2X 7 , or 61 °C for b - actin ) , and extension for 1 min at 68 °C . After the ﬁnal cycle , the samples were in - cubated for 10 min at 68 °C . PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis , followed by ethidium bro - mide staining . The primers were as described previously . 16 , 17 ) All primers were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science . Real - Time PCR Total RNA was isolated from LAD2 cells , and cDNA was synthesized as described above . To ex - amine the expression of TLR4 and b - actin mRNA , 0 . 5 m l ( for b - actin ) or 1 m l ( for TLR4 ) of cDNA were mixed with 1 m l of TaqMan primer / probe set ( Applied Biosystems , Fos - ter City , CA , U . S . A . ) , 10 m l of TaqMan Universal Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) , and UltraPure distilled water ( Gibco ) to bring the volume to 20 m l . Real - time PCR was performed with a model 7300 real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosys - tems ) . FlowCytomix LAD2 cells were treated with or without 1 m g / ml of LL - 37 for 6 h , and then LAD2 was washed with the culture medium twice after incubation with LL - 37 . They were incubated for 48 h in culture medium that included 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FCS ) , in the presence or absence of 150 ng / ml of LPS - binding protein ( LBP ) and lipopolysaccha - ride ( LPS ) .

RESULTS LAD2 Express FPRL1 and P2X 7 , and Induces Phos - phorylation of ERK1 / 2 or p - 38 by LL - 37 Treatment LL - 37 is known to directly bind to only FPRL1 , 18 ) a receptor for N - formylmethionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) , and is also reported to activate P2X 7 through the production of ATP . 19 ) And some studies have reported that LL - 37 activates mito - gen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , such as ERK1 / 2 and p38 20 , 21 ) ; therefore , to conﬁrm whether LAD2 cells can rec - ognize LL - 37 , we ﬁrst examined the expression of FPRL1 and P2X 7 using RT - PCR and evaluated the phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and p38 in LAD2 cells treated with LL - 37 . Both FPRL1 and P2X 7 were expressed by LAD2 ( Fig . 1A ) , and ERK1 / 2 and p - 38 were phosphorylated by LL - 37 treatment for 5 min and 30 min , respectively , as shown in Fig . 1B . Fur - thermore , LL - 37 induced b - Hex release from LAD2 cells February 2008 213 ( Fig . 1C ) , consistent with previous studies of rat mast cells . 22 ) These results indicate that LAD2 cells can recognize LL - 37 and are activated by LL - 37 . The Effect of LL - 37 on the Expression of TLRs on LAD2 Mast Cells In addition to its bactericidal activity , LL - 37 could activate immunocytes such as keratinocytes and mast cells 4 , 20 ) ; therefore , we hypothesized that LL - 37 might enhance mast cell capability to detect invading bacteria by modulation of TLR expression . TLR1 and TLR2 recognize peptidoglycan , 23 ) and TLR4 , TLR5 , and TLR9 recognize LPS , 24 ) ﬂagellin , 25 ) and CpG - DNA , 26 ) respectively . We exam - ined whether the expressions of these TLRs were changed in mast cells after incubation with 1 m g / ml of LL - 37 . Immuno - precipitation was used to detect TLR1 and TLR9 . Western blot study showed that TLR4 was up - regulated after 6 and 12 h of incubation with LL - 37 , but TLR1 , TLR2 , TLR5 , and TLR9 were not up - regulated ( Fig . 2A ) . Furthermore , LL - 37 increased TLR4 expression in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 2B ) . LL - 37 Up - Regulates TLR4 mRNA on LAD2 Mast Cells We further investigated the effect of LL - 37 on TLR4 by using real - time PCR . As shown in Fig . 3 , TLR4 mRNA was increased after 6 and 12 h of incubation with LL - 37 . Effect of LL - 37 on the Release of Cytokines and Chemokine from LAD2 Mast Cells LL - 37 has been re - ported to stimulate chemokine and cytokine secretion from a variety of cell types . 18 , 19 , 27 ) Thus , we examined the release of various humoral factors caused by LL - 37 treatment . LAD2 cells were treated with LL - 37 for 54 h . Cell culture super - natants were assayed by FlowCytomix to measure Th1 cy - tokines ( IFN - g , IL - 2 and TNF - b ) , Th2 cytokines ( IL - 4 , IL - 5 and IL - 10 ) , pro - inﬂammatory cytokines ( TNF - a , IL - 1 b and IL - 6 ) and chemokine ( IL - 8 ) . LL - 37 tended to increase IL - 2 and TNF - a , and signiﬁcantly increased IL - 1 b release from LAD2 cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Interestingly , LL - 37 also signiﬁcantly induced Th2 cytokines , IL - 4 and IL - 5 release ( Fig . 4 ) . LPS Negatively Regulates LL - 37 - Inducible Th2 Cy - tokine Release from LAD2 Cells LL - 37 generally co - ex - ists with the bacterial component at a local infection site be - cause microbe infection induces the generation of antimicro - bial peptide . To explore the cooperative effect of LL - 37 with bacterial components on mast cells , we next investigated the effect of LPS with LL - 37 on the generation of cytokines from mast cells . LAD2 cells were treated with LL - 37 for 6 h , and washed free of peptide before addition of the TLR4 agonist LPS , to avoid inactivation of LPS by LL - 37 in solution . 28 ) We then measured IL - 4 , IL - 5 and IL - 1 b in supernatant using FlowCy - tomix . LL - 37 signiﬁcantly increased IL - 4 , IL - 5 and IL - 1 b re - lease from LAD2 cells , as shown in Fig . 5 . LL - 37 - induced IL - 5 generation was cancelled by LPS and increased release of IL - 4 was also partly inhibited by LPS , although IL - 1 b 214 Vol . 31 , No . 2 Fig . 1 .

DISCUSSION It is well known that mast cells express FceRI , a high - afﬁnity IgE receptor , and induce allergic inﬂammation through aggregation of the receptor by antigen – antibody re - action . 29 ) Moreover , mast cells also express various func - tional TLRs and contribute to host defense or initiation of the innate immune response via TLRs . 11—13 ) Antimicrobial peptides secreted by epithelial and other cells possess bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of microbes , 1 ) and they have chemotactic activity against im - mune and inﬂammatory cells . 4 , 5 ) In addition to its chemotac - tic activity to mast cells , this peptide has other effects , such as the production of prostaglandins and interleukins , 22 ) im - plying that LL - 37 is an immune coordinator for mast cells . Thus , we examined the effects of LL - 37 on TLR expression and humoral factor release from human mast cells , and in - vestigated the role of LL - 37 in the functional change of mast cells . LL - 37 is known to directly bind to only FPRL1 18 ) ; how - ever , FPRL1 is not functional on rat mast cells . 5 ) LL - 37 pro - motes the processing and releasing of IL - 1 b from monocytes via the activation of P2X 7 , which is a nucleotide receptor , 19 ) but it is known that mast cells do not express this receptor 30 ) ; therefore , we ﬁrst conﬁrmed the expression of these recep - tors on LAD2 . Messenger RNA experiments revealed that LAD2 expressed these receptors . Next , to validate whether LAD2 cells can recognize LL - 37 , we examined the phospho - rylation of ERK1 / 2 and p38 in LAD2 cells treated with LL - 37 . We conﬁrmed that LL - 37 could activate LAD2 mast cells . Next , we examined the change in TLR expression in mast cells following stimulation with fMLP , a FPRL1 ligand , ATP or LL - 37 . In addition to its bactericidal activity , LL - 37 could activate immunocytes such as keratinocytes and mast cells . 4 , 20 ) Thus , we hypothesized that LL - 37 might enhance mast cell capability to detect invading bacteria by modulation of TLR expression . As expected , Western blot analysis showed that LL - 37 up - regulated TLR4 expression in a con - centration - and time - dependent manner but did not affect other TLRs on LAD2 mast cells . We further investigated the effect of LL - 37 on TLR4 expression by using real - time PCR . LL - 37 caused about a 1 . 6 - fold induction of TLR4 mRNA at 6 hours’ incubation . Kubo et al . demonstrated that about a 1 . 5 - fold increase of TLR4 mRNA by LPS treatment induces functional TLR4 protein expression using LAD2 mast cells , 31 ) suggesting that 1 . 6 - fold increase of TLR4 mRNA by LL - 37 may be involved in the up - regulation of TLR4 protein expression . We next examined the mechanisms of increased expression of TLR4 by LL - 37 . Whereas , neither fMLP nor ATP affected the expression of TLR4 , and they also did not cause cytokine release ( Supplemental Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Specu - lating that these receptors are not involved in the effect of LL - 37 : LL - 37 may affect LAD2 via unknown pathway . Oku - mura et al . and Yoshikawa et al . revealed that IFN - g up - regu - lated the TLR4 expression using mouse bone marrow - de - rived mast cells and human bone marrow - derived mast cells , respectively , 14 , 32 ) and Talreja et al . demonstrated that hista - mine induced TLR4 expression in endothelial cells . 33 ) We ex - amined IFN - g generation by LL37 , and assessed histamine release involved in the degranulation of mast cells ; however , 1 m g / ml of LL - 37 caused neither IFN - g release nor degranu - lation of mast cells , as shown in Figs . 1B and 4 ; therefore they might not participate in the mechanism of TLR4 up - reg - ulation . In fact , TLR4 expression was not changed by hista - mine treatment ( Supplemental Fig . 3 ) . Unfortunately , we could not indicate the mechanisms of the increased expres - sion of TLR4 by LL - 37 because details of the TLR4 expres - sion mechanisms are still unknown . Further investigation is therefore needed . It has been reported that LL - 37 could mediate both pro - in - ﬂammatory and anti - inﬂammatory effects by modulating hu - moral factor release . 34 ) We found that LL - 37 stimulates IL - 1 b February 2008 215 Fig . 4 . LL - 37 Induces the Release of IL - 1 b , IL - 4 and IL - 5 from LAD2 Mast Cells LAD2 cells were stimulated with or without LL - 37 ( 1 m g / ml ) for 54h .

Up - Regulation of Th2 - Type Cytokines by LL - 37 is Selectively Suppressed by LPS LAD2 cells were stimulated with or without LL - 37 ( 1 m g / ml ) for 6h . After washing free of peptide , these cells were incubated with or without LPS for 48h . The release of IL - 1 b , IL - 4 and IL - 5 in supernatants was then measured using FlowCytomix . Results are the means (cid:6) S . E .

The release of IL - 1 b would contribute to host defense by neutrophil ﬁltration . IL - 5 induces the growth , maturation and survival of eosinophils , 35 ) which play an essential role in the development of allergic inﬂammatory response . IL - 4 induces IgE production by B cells and promotes the preferential dif - ferentiation of T cells into the Th2 subset 36 ) ; therefore , our results suggested that LL - 37 can increase not only host de - fensive inﬂammatory response but also allergic inﬂammatory response . At local infection sites , bacterial components such as LPS would co - exist with LL - 37 because massive produc - tion is observed by bacterial infection although only a little LL - 37 is constantly produced on the skin surface . We there - fore investigated the change in cytokine generation on mast cells by costimulation of LL - 37 and LPS . LL - 37 - induced IL - 5 release was signiﬁcantly suppressed by LPS , and LL - 37 - in - duced IL - 4 release also tended to decrease with LPS . IL - 4 and IL - 5 are produced through the IL - 4 / STAT6 - dependent pathway . 37 , 38 ) IL - 4 / STAT6 signaling has been reported to be inhibited by SOCS - 1 , a suppressor of cytokine signaling , 39 ) whereas , it has been reported that SOCS - 1 is induced by LPS stimulation . 40 ) Therefore , we now speculate that SOCS - 1 is induced in response to LPS and this may cause the inhibition of LL - 37 - induced IL - 4 and IL - 5 release , although further in - vestigation is needed to clarify this point . Whereas , LL - 37 - induced IL - 1 b was not suppressed by LPS . These observa - tions might provide evidence that , in the presence of LPS , LL - 37 selectively induces host defensive inﬂammatory re - sponse in mast cells . In conclusion , this is the ﬁrst report to reveal that LL - 37 up - regulates TLR4 and Th2 - type and pro - inﬂammatory cy - tokine production , and that LL - 37 selectively induce host de - fensive inﬂammatory response in mast cells in the presence of LPS , and alter mast cell function by LPS stimulation . These observations may indicate that LL - 37 is a candidate modiﬁer of the host defense against bacterial entry by serv - ing as an alarm for sentinels such as mast cells .
