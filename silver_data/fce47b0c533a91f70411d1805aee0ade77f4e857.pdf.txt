Lee 1 Received : 30 July 2020 / Revised : 18 February 2021 / Accepted : 4 March 2021 # The Regenerative Engineering Society 2021 Abstract The cell plasma membrane suffers structural disruptions from both daily environmental stresses and trauma . Rapid loss of cell viability occurs if membrane integrity is not rapidly restored . Physiological membrane sealing involves alteration of local intermolecular thermodynamics that is manifested by changes in membrane tension which precede reassembly of the membrane planar bilayer structure . Certain block copolymer surfactants , including poloxamer 188 ( P188 ) , have been proven to seal - disrupted cell membranes . However , the specific molecular mechanics of poloxamer - mediated membrane sealing remains a target of investigation . A decrease in membrane tension precedes membrane sealing by natural intrinsic cell sealing processes . The effect of P188 on the quasistatic membrane tension of Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts cells under normal and saponin - permeabilized conditions was measured using laser optical tweezer ( LOT ) - extracted membrane tethers . The tether trap length of saponin - permeabilized MDCK cell membranes decreased from an uninjured control of 11 . 28 ± 1 . 1 μ m to 6 . 43 ± 0 . 67 μ m . Treatment with P188 ( 0 . 2 mM ) significantly increased the tether trap length to 9 . 69 ± 1 . 0 μ m ( p < 0 . 05 ) while the control polymer , polyethylene glycol ( 0 . 2 mM ) resulted in tether trap length of 7 . 02 ± 0 . 73 μ m that was not significantly different . Similar observations were made in the saponin - permeabilized fibroblasts . Corresponding fluorescence cell viability assays revealed that P188 - treated cells had a higher survival rate . Thus , surfactant copolymer membrane sealing restores the membrane integrity by decreasing the membrane tension . Lay Summary Cells quickly become non - viable when plasma membrane integrity is lost . Restoring or healing the cell membrane requires alteration in the forces that stabilize the membrane structure . The membrane defect healing processes are preceded by a decrease in membrane interfacial tension . This study demonstrated that amphiphilic block copolymer surfactants , such as poloxamer 188 ( P188 ) , reduce membrane tension and promote cell survival . Using laser optical tweezers , this work quantified the effect of surfactant copolymer - catalyzed sealing . Our work utilized laser optical tweezers to demonstrate that copolymer - catalyzed mem - brane sealing corresponds with a decrease in membrane tension , much like the physiologic response to membrane injury .

Laser optical tweezers Introduction Environmental physical stresses acting on biological systems are routine causes of cell injury , especially membrane disrup - tion . Because a large fraction of cell ATP production is used to maintain normal transmembrane electrolyte gradients , resto - ration of membrane structural integrity ( i . e . , sealing ) is essen - tial for post - injury cell survival . Intrinsically , cells have a fi - nite capability to repair damage because of intrinsic mem - brane repair processes .

When larger transmembrane defects occur , phospholipids are reordered that result in stable mem - brane defects . Repairing this requires energy expenditure and is often catalyzed by specific cellular fusogenic proteins that act to fuse intracellular vesicles with the plasma membrane at the site of the defect [ 25 ] . When cell membrane disruption is too extensive or repair processes have been completed , then membrane sealing can become feasible with the use of amphi - philic block copolymers [ 5 , 15 , 19 ] . It is now well established that sub - critical micelle con - centrations of biocompatible amphiphilic block copoly - mers like poloxamer 188 ( P188 ) catalyze rapid plasma membrane sealing of extensively disrupted skeletal mus - cle cell membranes [ 15 ] . This permeabilized plasma mem - brane sealing property of P188 is typical of amphiphilic block copolymers that are attracted to sites of cell mem - brane disruption , altering local molecular thermodynamics in such a way to favor regeneration of lipid bilayer struc - ture . The practical value and interest in these copolymers relate to their ability to augment survival after various forms of physical and chemical trauma that often lead to cell death [ 5 , 19 ] . For example , P188 also induces sealing of thermally injured skeletal muscle cells [ 22 ] , increases both survival and functionality of lethally heat - shocked fibroblasts [ 20 ] , reduces disruption due to high - dose ion - izing radiation [ 12 , 13 ] , and improves capillary blood flow following a burn [ 1 ] . Additionally , in embryonic hippocampal neurons , P188 protects against death due to membrane disruption induced by an excitotoxic drug , and death by oxygen - glucose deprivation [ 17 , 24 ] . A prior study by our group used atomic force micros - copy ( AFM ) imaging to visualize poloxamer - mediated membrane sealing [ 2 ] . AFM imaging provided direct ev - idence of cell membrane permeabilization by saponin . After treatment with 0 . 01 % saponin for 15 min , AFM imaging revealed increased surface roughness relative to control that has been previously correlated with increased membrane permeabilization . After subsequent treatment with P188 for 30 min , the membrane topography returned towards normal ( Fig . 1 ) . While our AFM study allowed for direct visualization of membrane damage by saponin and subsequent resealing by P188 , it does not answer the question of how poloxamers are capable of mediating resealing . Poloxamer 188 and similar copolymer surfactants only interact with the cell membrane at the site of the damage [ 10 , 11 , 18 ] . P188 inserts into phospholipid membranes at sites that correspond to increased spacing between the phos - pholipids where there are exposed hydrophobic components of the lipid bilayer [ 18 , 23 ] . This suggests that the mecha - nism of P188 attraction is dependent on interaction of the hydrophobic subunit of the P188 molecule with hydrophobic regions of the membrane [ 23 ] . In intact lipid vesicles , P188 has been shown to adhere to the surface of the phospholipid bilayer [ 3 , 4 , 31 ] . At the surface , P188 has been shown to modify the water interface at both the surface and interior of the bilayer , in both cases retarding the hydration dynamics and decreasing water diffusivity , while not interfering with lipid packing density [ 3 , 4 ] . It was suggested that P188 may modify hydration dynamics in the interior by slowing hydra - tion dynamics at the surface and reducing fluctuations of the lipid interface [ 3 ] . Togo et al . [ 26 ] reported that a decrease in membrane tension preceded sealing of disrupted cell membranes . The purpose of this study is to quantify the change in mem - brane stiffness of permeabilized mammalian cells before and after treatment with P188 . As an osmotic and antioxidant con - trol , polyethylene glycol of similar molecular weight and con - centration was used . Membrane elasticity and tension have been quantitatively determined for many cell types including human MSCs , fibroblasts , neuronal growth cones , and others through tether extraction via laser optical tweezers ( LOT ) [ 14 , 16 , 23 , 26 ] . Additionally , during recovery of disrupted mem - branes through intrinsic cell repair , there must be a decrease in membrane stiffness that precedes membrane sealing [ 28 , 29 ] . In this study , we used LOT as previously described by Titushkin et al . , to measure membrane stiffness and to eluci - date possible membrane sealing mechanisms of P188 [ 26 ] . Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Viability Assay Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells were obtained from the Karl Matlin lab , Department of Surgery at the University of Chicago . NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were pur - chased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) ( Manassas , VA ) . MDCK cells were chosen due to our extensive experience in maintaining them under culture conditions and with controlled phenotypic expression . 3T3 fibroblasts were also analyzed to determine whether the mechanism of action of P188 was generalizable to other cell types . The MDCK and 3T3 fibroblast cell lines were separately grown in different incubators in monolay - er culture in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) containing L - glutamine , 10 % fetal bovine se - rum , 5 mM fructose , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . The cultures were maintained in sterile cell culture plastic flasks at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . They became sub - confluent in 5 – 6 days and were split 1 : 3 every week . Swiss 3T3 fibro - blast cell lines were split 1 : 10 every week . Cells were dispersed with trypsin / EDTA and plated on a 22 × 22 - mm coverslip 1 or 2 days before the experi - ment . For microscopic observation and laser optical twee - zers ’ manipulation , the coverslip with confluent adhered Regen . Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2022 ) 8 : 134 – 144 135 cells was washed with Hanks buffered salt solution ( HBSS ) with 5 mM fructose three times , mounted on a microscope glass slide with a 100 μ m spacer , and sealed at the edges of the coverslip . All experiments were con - ducted at room temperature . Cell culture media and sup - plements were from Life Technologies ( Carlsbad , CA ) . In order to differentiate cells with significant membrane destabilization from cells with stable membranes , cells were stained with Ethidium Homodimer ( EthD - 1 ) and Calcein - AM according to the protocol of the manufacturer ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . EthD - 1 is a dye that will fluoresce red when it binds to DNA , while Calcein - AM green fluorescence indicates that the cell maintained its metabolic capabilities . Only cells that stained positive with EthD - 1 were considered saponin - permeabilized . For a positive control , cells that stained negative for EthD - 1 were also measured . Membrane Tension Assessment by Maximum Tether Length ( MTL ) To determine the maximum length that the membrane tether could be extracted , cells adherent to the coated glass coverslips were washed with Hanks buffered salt solution ( HBSS ) three times , incubated with cytochalasin D for 40 min at 37 °C , mounted on a microscope glass slide with a 100 μ m spacer , and sealed at the edges of the coverslip . All experiments were conducted at room tem - perature . Fluorescent polystyrene beads 0 . 5 μ m in diam - eter ( FluoSpheres , 515 nm emission , Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) were attached to the cell surface to achieve tether extraction from the cell membrane . To attach the beads to the membrane , mouse anti - CD29 monoclonal antibodies ( Research Diagnostics , Concord , MA ) were co - valently coupled to the carboxylate - modified bead surface via carbodiimide linkage using the conjugation procedure described by Titushkin et al . [ 9 , 26 ] Briefly , 200 mg of mouse anti - CD29 antibody in 200 ml MES buffer ( 50 mM 2 - morpholinoethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) , at pH 6 . 0 ) was mixed with the same volume of 2 % aqueous suspension of carboxylate - modified microspheres , and 5 mg N - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - N9 - ethylcarbodiimide hydrochlo - ride ( EDAC , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was added . After incubation on a shaker for 2 h at room temperature , the suspension was washed in PBS three times by centri - fugation . After final centrifugation , the precipitate was suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1 % bovine serum Fig . 1 AFM images of MDCK cell surface topography .

Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2022 ) 8 : 134 – 144 albumin ( BSA ) and 2 mM sodium azide and stored at 4 °C . Before each experiment , the suspension was sonicated and diluted 100 times with PBS . A coverslip with cells was incubated with a 3 % BSA solution for 10 min , then 100 ml of bead suspension for 5 min at room temperature . Cells were washed in PBS and mounted on a microscope slide . A laser optical “ tweezer ” device ( LOT system ) was used to pull fluorescent beads away from the membrane of monolayer - cultured cells as previously described by Dai and Sheetz et al . [ 6 , 7 ] The MTL was defined as the tether length reached from the start of bead pulling to its escape from the LOT . An inverted Nikon microscope ( Eclipse E - 800 , Nikon , Melville , NY ) and fluorescent im - ages were recorded with a CCD camera at 10 frames per second . The laser optical tweezers used for particle optical trapping consisted of an infrared Nd : YAG laser ( 1064 nm , continuous wave , 5 W maximum output power , Spectra Physics , Inc . , Mountain View , CA ) that was focused with a 60× oil - immersion microscope objective . In order to pull bead - attached membrane tethers from the cell mem - brane , a mobile latex bead attached to the cell was selec - tively chosen from the edge of a cell and optically trapped . The bead was displaced by moving the optical trap away from the cell at constant speed in the range 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 mm / s . The bead position was monitored and recorded continuously at a 10 - Hz frame rate . The bead was held 2 μ m above the coverslip to avoid viscous coupling to the glass surface during measurements . The bead position was monitored , tracked , and recorded continuously until the bead escaped from the trap and quickly moved back to the original position ( Fig . 2 ) . The capability to extract a membrane tether is dependent on the strength of the bead binding to membrane integrins . Therefore , only bead dis - placements greater than 1 μ m were analyzed . They were analyzed in nanometer - scale resolution using the analysis software MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices , Downingtown , PA ) . Typically , 15 beads from 15 cells were analyzed for each experiment condition and cell type . Displacement was measured by the position of the bead before and after tether formation . Cytochalasin Treatment Cytochalasin D is well known to increase plasmalemma cell membrane mechanical compliance by detaching the plasma membrane from the stiffer cytoskeleton [ 18 ] . Once adhesive forces are lessened , the cortical cytoskeleton loses its control of mechanical functions of the plasma membrane . Consequently , the plasma membrane becomes more flexible and easier to stretch during membrane tether formation by optically trapping membrane - bound and antibody - coated latex beads using LOT . Cytochalasin D - treated cells were found to form substantially longer tethers when compared to untreated cells [ 26 , 27 ] , sug - gesting Cytochalasin D decreases the membrane tension . Therefore , we incubated the coverslips containing MDCK cells with Cytochalasin D ( 2 μ M ) for 40 min at room temperature prior to measuring MTLs in all experiments . To quantify tension reduction during active membrane sealing , we treated cells with Cytochalasin D ( CTD ) . CTD is known to reduce membrane tension in a dose - dependent manner [ 30 ] . At a concentration of 3 μ M , 20 % tension reduction was observed , and at 30 μ M , the reduction increases to 50 % . CTD was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Five milligram of CTD was dissolved in 1 . 066 ml of DMSO into 3 . 00 M stock solution and was kept at – 20 °C . When used for an experiment , the stock solution was thawed and diluted with fresh buffer to twice the desired concentration ( 20 μ M ) . An equal v / v dilution with the cell suspension yielded the desired concentration of 10 μ M . Measurements were performed after 5 - min incubation , ex - cept during experiments investigating effects of long - term exposure to CTD . Before measuring the effect of poloxamer 188 and polyethylene glycol on the mechanical properties of permeabilized cell membranes , baseline measurements were made using cytochalasin - treated MDCK and Swiss 3T3 cells with intact cell membranes that had not been exposed to saponin . Membrane Disruption and Surfactant Sealing To study the effect of cell membrane disruption on MTL , the cell membranes were permeabilized at room temperature using 0 . 005 % saponin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) in DMEM for 5 min . The cells were quickly washed in HBSS three times to remove the saponin . Then the coverslips were placed in DMEM containing either ( 1 ) no polymer treatment , ( 2 ) 0 . 2 mM poloxamer 188 ( P188 , 8 . 4 kDa , Maroon Biotech Corp , Chicago , IL ) , or ( 3 ) 0 . 2 mM polyethylene glycol ( PEG , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , for 30 min at 37 °C . Samples were then washed with HBSS and mounted on microscope coverslips as previously described . All injured samples saw the same conditions . Quantifying Membrane Tension The LOT system involves optical trapping of a bead in this experiment . The trapped particle experiences dis - placement similar to an object attached to a mechanical spring [ 8 , 9 ] . The force , F r , exerted on the bead by the trap is therefore given by the product of the displacement , x , and the force constant , k , ( i . e . , Fr = kx ) [ 9 ] . In our protocol , a constant force is applied on the bead by the Regen . Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2022 ) 8 : 134 – 144 137 trap , and the magnitude of the force is constant through - out the various experiments . In our experiments , laser optical tweezers ( LOT ) were used as described in Titushkin et al . [ 26 , 27 ] Micrometer - sized beads were at - tached to the surfaces of MCDK cells and optically trapped . As the bead was pulled away from the mem - brane , a tether was formed . The capability to extract a membrane tether is dependent on the strength of the bead binding to membrane integrins . Therefore , only bead displacements greater than 1 μ m were considered for quantitative analysis . The membrane reservoir consists of extra plasma membrane stored in folds or invagi - nations of the plasma membrane [ 23 ] . Extraction of cell mem - brane tethers undergoes three phases : a pseudo - plastic phase in which a small increase in force is associated with tether extraction , then a plateau of the force curve in which constant force produces tether elongation , and finally an exponential force increase with tether extraction as the tether escapes the trap [ 23 , 26 ] . In our experiments , the membrane tether was extracted to the point where the membrane extraction energy exceeded the LOT bead confinement energy . The exact same membrane tether extraction protocol was repeated for each experiment with the specific goal to compare normal , perme - abilized , and polymer - sealed cell membranes ( Fig . 2 ) . Data Analysis Control normal membrane tension measurements were taken from healthy MDCK cells that had not been exposed to sapo - nin . Roughly fifteen tethers were pulled from MDCK cells on each coverslip and three coverslips were analyzed for each experimental condition . Experimental conditions compared were control ( no saponin ) , P188 ( 0 . 2 mM ) , PEG ( 0 . 2 mM ) , saponin ( 0 . 005 % ) , saponin followed by P188 , and saponin followed by PEG . There was considerable variability in the tether lengths for cell to cell . Thus , a set of experiments were performed to compare tether lengths from MDCK cells on the same coverslip that survived versus those that did not survive saponin exposure . At least 15 replicates were performed for all conditions . To compare between mean values of two data points , an unpaired Student ’ s t - test was performed . All statistical analysis was performed using R ( 3 . 4 . 0 ) . Fig . 2 ( Top ) Schematic representation of laser tweezers to probe plasma membrane tension of cell . An antibody - coated bead , trapped by the laser tweezers , was attached to the plasma membrane , and a membrane tether was formed by moving the laser . The force required to pull the bead increases as the membrane is stretched beyond its plastic phase until the forces exceeds the holding strength of the LOT . Photomicrographs of the measurement are shown : a : trapping the bead ; b : pulling the tether with LOT , and c : the bead escaped from trap 138 Regen . Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2022 ) 8 : 134 – 144 Results Cell Viability After plating in T - 75 flasks under standard cell culture conditions in our cell culture incubators , the population doubling time of the sub - confluent MDCK cells was ap - proximately 12 h . The MDCK cells adhered to the poly - D - lysine - coated glass coverslips sufficiently to permit membrane tension measurements . Disruption of the actin organization in the MDCK cells with cytochalasin D treat - ment did not cause a measurable decrease in cell viability as measured by the EthD - 1 staining ( Fig . 3 ) . As anticipat - ed , there was a tendency towards decreased cell viability following saponin treatment as determined by an apparent increase in cytoplasmic ethidium homodimer ( EthD ) staining compared to the control , and a subsequent de - crease in staining indicating improved survival after P188 treatment ( Fig . 3 ) . Similar results were obtained when using calcein - AM to test for metabolic pathway functions : saponin treatment causes a decrease in calcein - AM - positive cells relative to control , while treat - ment with P188 causes an increase in calcein - AM - positive cells after saponin treatment . Maximum Tether Length Measurements The mean maximum tether length ( MTL ) ± SEM for control ( non - injured and non - treated ) MDCK cells was 11 . 3 ± 1 . 1 μ m . The mean MTL ± SEM for control cells ( non - injured ) incubated with 0 . 2 mM poloxamer 188 was 12 . 8 ± 0 . 89 μ m and the mean MTL ± SEM for 0 . 2 mM PEG - treated cells was 12 . 3 ± 0 . 98 μ m . Neither the addition of P188 nor PEG to the bathing solution of uninjured cells resulted in a significant difference in MTL ( p > 0 . 2 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Also , the mean MTL did not depend on the pull rates in the range 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 mm / s . At these low velocities , the membrane viscosity has negligible effects on bead dynamics [ 26 ] . The slower rate may also allow the membrane cytoskeleton to biochemically rearrange in response to high tension , eliminat - ing the strain rate - dependent component of cytoskeleton reorganization Fig . 3 Fluorescence photomicrograph ( 200× ) of calcein / EthD - labeled MDCK cells . a Control uninjured cells . b Saponin - treated cells with re - duced density due to injury .

( 2022 ) 8 : 134 – 144 139 MTL Response to Saponin Permeabilization and Polymer Treatment Following saponin - mediated membrane cell disruption , mem - brane maximum MTL measurements were made as described . The mean MTL ± SEM decreased to 6 . 43 ± 0 . 67 μ m after treatment with saponin ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . The permeabilization by saponin created water - filled defects , which tend to increase the membrane tension . When MDCK cells were treated with P188 , the MTL significantly increased to 9 . 69 ± 1 . 00 μ m ( p < 0 . 01 ) . When treated with PEG and DMEM , MTLs became 7 . 02 ± 0 . 7 μ m and 5 . 61 ± 0 . 7 μ m ( p > 0 . 2 for both ) , respectively . These MTLs were not statis - tically different than the saponin - permeabilized cells . Furthermore , the saponin - permeabilized , DMEM - treated cells were significantly different than the non - permeabilized cells with HBSS ( p < 0 . 01 ) . An increase in membrane MTL is indicative of decreased membrane tension . Since it is unlikely that P188 restores the membrane tension by restoring mem - brane lipid reservoir , these results suggest P188 decreased membrane tension more likely by resealing the defects . Next we compared the effects of P188 in damaged yet viable cells to non - viable cells . The MTL ± SEM of saponin - permeabilized MDCK cells that were viable deter - mined by fluorometric assay ( i . e . , negative EthD - 1 uptake and positive for calcein uptake ) was quantified . The MTL was observed to increase from 7 . 5 ± 1 . 1 to 13 . 7 ± 3 . 6 μ m after P188 treatment ( p < 0 . 01 ) . P188 - treated viable cells had sig - nificantly longer MTLs than PEG - treated cells with a length of 6 . 3 ± 1 . 56 μ m ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . Using a similar method , we selected non - viable cells ( i . e . , positive EthD - 1 and nega - tive calcein uptake ) . MTLs of P188 - treated cells increased from 5 . 2 ± 1 . 8 to 8 . 7 ± 2 . 0 μ m ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Again , the MTLs of P188 - treated cells were significantly longer than PEG - treated cells with a length of 6 . 1 ± 1 . 2 μ m ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . This indicates that P188 catalyzed a change in cell mem - brane structure or properties to reduce membrane tension in both permeabilized viable and non - viable cells . Saponin - permeabilized MDCK cells that were treated with the mem - brane sealing surfactant P188 manifested membrane mechan - ical stiffness that was not significantly different from the non - injured and non - treated control MDCK cells ( p > 0 . 2 ) . P188 treatment led to significantly longer MTL in viable cells com - pared to non - viable cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) . This difference is likely because the defects incurred by a permeabilized , non - viable cell are likely significantly larger than that of a permeabilized Fig . 4 Scatter plots of maximum tether length ( MTL ) recordings achievable with laser optical tweezers using MDCK cells in monolayer lysine - coated cover - slips for : ( 1 ) Control uninjured cells .

This results in greater membrane water content and decreases the membrane reservoir for the tether to be pulled from in the non - viable cells . There was no difference in MTLs observed between viable - and non - viable - permeabilized MDCK cells treated with PEG which is similar to the insignificant difference be - tween the MTLs of permeabilized MDCK cells that were maintained in HBSS as shown in Fig . 5 . This supported the previous observations that PEG in 0 . 2 mM concentration does not catalyze sealing of saponin - permeabilized cell membranes . Comparison between MDCK and 3T3 Fibroblast Responses For comparison , the MTL ± SEM for control fibroblasts was 13 . 8 ± 1 . 31 μ m . For saponin - permeabilized fibro - blasts , the MTL significantly decreased to 4 . 6 ± 0 . 64 μ m which was substantially different than normal ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Regarding the ability of P188 and PEG to re - seal the saponin - permeabilized membranes , P188 treat - ment resulted in an increase in MTL to 9 . 8 ± 3 . 09 μ m , which was substantially different than permeabilized cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 6 ) but not significantly different than non - permeabilized controls . After treatment with PEG , the MTL was 5 . 27 ± 0 . 65 , and not significantly different than treatment with saponin only ( p > 0 . 2 ) . Treatment of saponin - permeabilized 3T3 fibroblasts with DMEM re - sulted in MTLs of 3 . 66 ± 0 . 56 , which were not signifi - cantly different than treatment with saponin only ( p > 0 . 2 ) . Furthermore , DMEM did not catalyze significant change in permeabilized fibroblasts ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Thus , P188 - mediated reduction in membrane line tension appears to be cell type independent . Discussion These experiments indicate that membrane sealing in saponin - permeabilized cells after P188 treatment correlates with a re - duction in membrane tension . We did not observe spontane - ous , non - surfactant - mediated sealing in these saponin - lysed cells . These findings are quite consistent with the well - established disrupted cell membrane sealing effect of P188 because P188 could not add phospholipid to the plasma membrane . Although we did not monitor membrane tension dur - ing the sealing process , we found that agents that do not reduce membrane tension also did not seal saponin - permeabilized membranes . This correlation be - tween membrane sealing and decreased membrane ten - sion corroborates Togo ’ s findings , and suggests that Fig . 5 Maximum tether length ( MTL ) data for saponin - treated MDCK cells plotted as a function of membrane permeability and polymer treat - ment . Data in this plot is derived from saponin - treated sub - confluent MDCK cells on coverslips . Some were permeabilized to extracellular EthD - 1 ( non - viable ) andothers ( viable ) werenot . MDCKcells withintact membranes ( i . e . , viable cells ) manifested longer MTLs . 0 . 2 mM P188 treatment increased MTL in both viable and non - viable MDCK cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) while 0 . 2 mM PEG had no significant effect on MTLs for either viable or non - viable cells Regen . Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2022 ) 8 : 134 – 144 141 P188 may be able to exert its effects on permeabilized cells by reducing membrane tension , which mimics the endogenous repair mechanism [ 23 , 24 ] . It is well established that amphiphilic triblock copoly - mers such as P188 seal and regenerate the structure of permeabilized cell membranes and pure lipid bilayer membranes [ 5 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 20 ] . Membrane sealing is de - fined as restoration of lipid bilayer structure and reduction of water - filled membrane . The mechanism of surfactant - catalyzed membrane sealing is linked to surfactant - mediated alteration in interfacial water structure . Thus , the reduction in tension is likely the result of altered water - membrane interactions that mediate membrane tension . Altering the structure of interfacial water at the cell membrane would alter LOT - measured membrane MTL by at least two mechanisms . The first is reducing the water content in membrane defects . The bulk modulus of water in confined compression is several GPa . Thus , lipid bilayer containing water will be much stiffer than an intact lipid bilayer . An intact lipid bilayer would be more compliant than a membrane with aqueous defects [ 8 ] . In addition , it is also feasible that A - B - A copolymer surfac - tants could accelerate the kinetics of cytoplasmic vesicle fusion to disrupted plasma membranes . Marks et al . [ 17 ] demonstrated increased membrane electrical capacitance measured during membrane sealing , suggesting added membrane surface area . We hypothesize that the hydrophobic domain of P188 will adhere to hydrophobic regions of the damaged plas - ma membrane ( Fig . 7c ) . After insertion , the hydrophilic tails of P188 alter the water interface of the defect , most likely by hydrogen bonding with the water molecules in the vicinity of the injury and competing for hydrogen - bonding sites on the exposed phospholipid head groups . ( Fig . 7 ) The effects of the water interface modifications should be similar to those described in Cheng et al . , in which P188 was able to reduce diffusivity of water mol - ecules at both the bilayer surface and interior [ 3 , 4 ] . The restoration of normal lipid density of the membrane leads to pushing out of the membrane - bound P188 ( Fig . 7d ) . This ability to target defects in the membrane distin - guishes P188 from PEG which has been well studied in the repair of membranes . PEG is a pure hydrophilic poly - mer that does not adhere to sites of membrane disruption [ 2 ] . Thus , concentrations of PEG required to seal - disrupted membranes are in the range of 100 mM , much higher than the 0 . 2 mM concentrations of the surfactant copolymer P188 used in these studies . This makes surfac - tant copolymers much more suitable for clinical use to Fig . 6 Scatter plots of maximum tether length ( MTL ) recordings achievable with laser optical tweezers using NIH 3T3 fibro - blasts in monolayer lysine - coated coverslips for : ( 1 ) Control unin - jured cells .
