This study provides an in - sight into distinct patterns of SARS - CoV - 2 household transmission in case of pedi - atric and adult index cases as well as age - dependent susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Methods : Immune analysis , medical interviewing , and contact tracing of 26 families with confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection cases have been conducted . Blood samples were analyzed serologically with the use of a SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG assay and virus neutralization test ( VNT ) . Uni - and multivariable linear regression and mixed effect logistic regression models were used to describe potential risk factors for higher con - tagiousness and susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Results : SARS - CoV - 2 infection could be confirmed in 67 of 124 family members . Fourteen children and 11 adults could be defined as index cases in their households . Forty of 82 exposed family members were defined as secondarily infected . The mean secondary attack rate in households was 0 . 48 and was significantly higher in house - holds with adult than with pediatric index cases ( 0 . 85 vs 0 . 19 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . The age ( grouped into child and adult ) of index case , severity of disease , and occurrence of lower respiratory symptoms in index cases were significantly associated with second - ary transmission rates in households . Children seem to be equally susceptible to ac - quire a SARS - CoV - 2 infection as adults , but they suffer milder courses of the disease or remain asymptomatic . Conclusion : SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from infected children to other household members occurred rarely in the first wave of the pandemic , despite close physical contact and the lack of hygienic measures . 2 of 9 | SIEBER et al . 1 | INTRODUCTION Children contribute strongly to the spread of respiratory viruses , such as seasonal influenza or rhinoviruses 1 and therefore were considered as potential silent spreaders of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) at the beginning of the pandemic . This as - sumption led to preventive measures such as school closures and isola - tion for a large number of children , which have had a significant impact on children ' s physical and mental health as well as their education . The evidence addressing the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from infected children is still scarce , and the findings are controversial , with some studies suggesting children to be relevant spreaders of the virus 2 – 7 and others emphasizing their limited role in disease transmission . 8 – 18 Only few studies give direct evidence of children acting as index cases in their households . 19 While this could be underestimated due to asymp - tomatic courses of disease in children and in consequence less fre - quent testing , there is growing evidence that secondary attack rates from infected children are lower than from infected adults . This study describes age - dependent SARS - CoV - 2 transmission pat - terns within households and determines the potential role of children in this process . Additionally , we tried to define risk factors for higher contagiousness of index cases and higher susceptibility of exposed in - dividuals . A better understanding of these issues is relevant not only for the control of future SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks but also to maintain the function of child - care facilities during the ongoing pandemic . 2 | METHODS 2 . 1 | Study population Twenty - six SARS - CoV - 2 seropositive and two qPCR - positive chil - dren were defined in a cross - sectional study with 2069 schoolchil - dren in Austria , performed from May 2020 to July 2020 at the end of the first national lockdown . 20 These children , their parents , and siblings were invited to participate in a longitudinal , follow - up study , which aimed to describe the transmission patterns of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in households ( current manuscript ) and to describe the immune response to SARS - CoV - 2 and its longevity in time 21 ( IRB of Medical University of Vienna # 2104 / 2020 ) . In total , 26 families with 124 family members were analyzed ( Figure 1 . ) . All subjects and / or legal representatives signed an informed consent form . 2 . 2 | Study design This manuscript includes data from the first follow - up visit of a longi - tudinal study and gathers nearly all family members of families with identified SARS - CoV - 2 infections ( Figure S1 ) . A comprehensive medi - cal interview covering sociodemographic data , concomitant diseases , personal history of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , and history of previous SARS - CoV - 2 testing as well as detailed contact tracing was performed . The blood samples were analyzed with the use of SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG against RBD ( ELISA , Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise , China ) and virus neutralization test ( VNT ) , as described previously . 22 For the ELISA , a cutoff of 1 U / ml ( equivalent to 5 . 4 IU / ml ) was used for detection of binding antibodies , for virus neutral - ization test ( VNT ) , a titer of ≥10 was considered positive for the de - tection of neutralizing antibodies . Sample collection was performed during Nov – Dec 2020 , which was around 9 - month postsymptom onset , as assessed for symptomatic individuals . 2 . 3 | Study definitions A confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection was defined as having a positive SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG ELISA result in the study or a history of a positive qPCR test or a positive validated antibody testing . The index case in a family was defined based on the chronology of the onset of the symptoms among confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases . Defined index cases were categorized as child ( 0 – 18 years old ) or adult ( > 18 years old ) . Asymptomatic cases were considered as index cases only if they were the exclusive person tested seropositive in the household . Secondary cases were defined as further household members with a confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Symptomatic patients were defined as those who presented COVID - 19 - like symptoms in the period ( ± 15 days ) linked to a con - firmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection in the household . Symptoms were categorized as upper respiratory , lower respira - tory , neurologic , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , joint and muscular symptoms , skin manifestation , fever , and nonspecific symptoms ( such as tiredness and headache ) . Disease severity was defined as K E Y WO R DS child , contagiousness , COVID - 19 , household transmission , SARS - CoV - 2 , secondary attack rate , susceptibility Key Message Child - to - child and child - to - adult transmissions of SARS - CoV - 2 were infrequent at the beginning of the pandemic , despite close physical contact and the lack of protective measures . Age of the index case , type of symptoms , and disease severity seem to play a role in the household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Susceptibility of children to acquire SARS - CoV - 2 infection seems to be similar to the susceptibility of adult individuals ; however , children suffer from milder courses of the disease or remain asymptomatic . | 3 of 9 SIEBER et al . minimal in case of exclusively unspecific symptoms lasting for a couple of days only ; mild in case of mild symptoms with good gen - eral condition ; intermittent in case of symptoms with a bad general condition , which could be managed in the outpatient settings ; se - vere in case of a need for hospitalization and oxygen support . The secondary attack rate ( SAR ) was defined as a rate of second - ary infection among all contacts of the index case within the family and was based on a seropositive immune status of tested individuals or PCR positivity by history . Secondary attack rate was calculated for each fam - ily by dividing the number of confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections among household contacts by the total number of tested household contacts . Exposed individuals were defined as close , unprotected house - hold contacts of defined index cases . 2 . 4 | Statistical analysis Statistical analysis were performed in order to determine predictors for the SAR within the family and for the risk of secondary infection for each individual , defined as binary variable . To examine the asso - ciation between the SAR and possible predictors , at first , univariable linear regressions were computed . Subsequently , a multivariable linear regression was performed , including all variables that were significant in the univariable models as predictors . Investigated pre - dictors were sex , age ( grouped into child or adult , cutoff 18 years ) , and occurrence of different symptoms in the index case ( symptoms were categorized as described in the section Study definitions ) , as well as disease severity and duration of symptoms in the index case , number of people in the household and living space area . The association between the risk of individual secondary infec - tion ( binary outcome— yes or no ) and possible predictors ( see below ) was investigated using generalized linear mixed models with a link function ( i . e . , mixed effects logistic regression ) , including the random factor “family ID” in order to account for possible correlation within the family . In more detail , at first , univariable models were computed , followed by a multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model including all predictors that were significant in the univariable mod - els as fixed effects and the “family ID” as a random effect . Predictors considered as independent variables in the univariable models were sex , age group ( child vs . adult , cutoff 18 years ) , and comorbidities of the individual , living space area , number of people in the household , as well as age group ( child vs . adult , cutoff 18 years ) , duration and type of symptoms ( as described in section Study definition ) of the index case . Due to the exploratory character of the study , no correction for multiplicity was performed , and p - values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . All statistical analyses and graphs were gen - erated in R ( version 4 . 1 . 3 ) , using packages stats ( version 4 . 1 . 3 ) , Ime4 ( version 1 . 1 . 30 ) , and ggplot2 ( version 3 . 3 . 6 ) . 3 | RESULTS 3 . 1 | Demographic description of the study population Twenty - six families agreed to participate . In total , 124 family mem - bers were analyzed , 62 children ( 5 – 18 years old ) and 62 adults ( > 18 years old ) . One hundred four individuals provided a full medical FIGURE 1 Overview of the study population . 26 families 124 family members 104 tested serologically in the study 20 not tested serologically in the study 10 confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections by history 10 without any SARS - CoV - 2 testing 57 serologically confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections 67 confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections 47 seronegative individuals 4 of 9 | SIEBER et al . history and a blood sample for serological analysis , 52 children and 52 adults ( Table S1 ) . In addition , for 20 family members , who did not provide blood samples in the study , medical history of COVID - 19 - like symptoms and / or qPCR - and / or antibody testing could be evaluated . The size of families varied from three to seven members ( Table S2 ) . 3 . 2 | Confirmation of SARS - CoV - 2 infection In total , 57 of 104 ( 54 . 8 % ) subjects tested positive for the SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG ELISA ( Wantai ) Neutralizing antibodies in VNT were detected in 39 of 57 ( 68 . 4 % ) seropositive subjects . The titers of SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG and VNT did not differ significantly between seropositive children and adults . Additionally , 10 family members , not tested in the study , reported a history of a positive SARS - CoV - 2 testing ( Table 1 . ) . 3 . 3 | Clinical presentation of SARS - CoV - 2 infections Among 57 seropositive individuals , 46 ( 80 . 7 % ) were symptomatic : 23 of 31 ( 74 . 2 % ) children and 23 of 26 ( 88 . 5 % ) adults . General symptoms , such as headache and tiredness , were most frequently reported , regardless of age , followed by lower respiratory symptoms in adults , taste and smell disorders and upper respiratory symptoms in children . There were no severe courses , cases of hospitalization , or deaths in any age group . The majority of symptoms were reported for March – April 2020 . In general , adults reported more symptoms than children and the duration of these was longer ( Table S3 ) . 3 . 4 | Contact tracing Contact tracing revealed 25 household index cases and their ex - posed household contacts . In case of one family , the determination of the index case in the household was inconclusive , and therefore was not analyzed for transmission patterns . Four family members could be defined as “not exposed” to SARS - CoV - 2 in the household , due to travel activities coinciding with SARS - CoV - 2 infection of the index case , and therefore were also not analyzed . Thus , 25 families with 107 family members were analyzed for age - dependent house - hold virus transmission patterns , and 82 exposed contacts were ana - lyzed for age - dependent susceptibility patterns ( Figure 2 . ) . 3 . 5 | Age - dependent transmission pattern Fourteen children ( Figure 3I ) were defined as index cases in their families . The majority of them could be linked to SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tions in educational settings . These pediatric index cases reported mild or minimal COVID - 19 - like symptoms , and only two of them were asymptomatic . In total , 10 of 46 ( 21 . 7 % ) contact persons of these pediatric index cases could be defined as secondary infected . Eleven adults ( Figure 3II ) were defined as index cases in their family , and the infection could be assigned either to an occupa - tional transmission , traveling , or contact with the healthcare sys - tem . These individuals reported mild or intermittent COVID - 19 - like symptoms , and none of them were asymptomatic . In total , 30 of 36 ( 83 . 3 % ) contact persons of these adult index cases could be defined as secondary infected . 3 . 6 | Secondary attack rate and the risk factors for higher contagiousness Overall , the SAR for all exposed individuals was estimated at 0 . 48 . Secondary attack rate was significantly lower ( p < 0 . 0001 ) in house - holds with pediatric index cases than households with adult index cases ( 0 . 19 ; 0 . 85 ; respectively ) ( Figure 4A ) . The age group of index cases ( p < 0 . 001 ) , severity of disease ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and occurrence of lower respiratory symptoms ( p < 0 . 05 ) were found to be associated with higher SARs in households in uni - variable analyses . In the subsequent multivariable analysis , solely the age group of the index cases remained statistically significant ( Tables 2 and S4 ) . 3 . 7 | Susceptibility to acquire SARS - CoV - 2 infection and its risk factors In total , 82 tested family contacts of 25 defined index cases were analyzed . Twenty - four of 46 ( 52 . 2 % ) adult contacts and 16 of 36 ( 44 . 4 % ) pediatric contacts tested positive . Children were not found to be less susceptible to acquire SARS - CoV - 2 infection than adults ( Table 2 ; Figure 4B ) . Mixed effect logistic models showed no statisti - cally significant associations between age groups , sex , or underlying comorbidities of exposed individuals and the risk of acquiring infec - tion . The age group of index case ( child vs . adult , p < 0 . 001 ) , with whom an exposed individual was in contact with , and the occurrence of lower respiratory symptoms ( p < 0 . 05 ) in the index case were sta - tistically significant in the univariable analyses . In the multivariable model , only the age group of the index case remained significantly associated with the risk of acquiring infection ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Table S5 ) . 4 | DISCUSSION Up to date , evidence of children acting as the source of SARS - CoV - 2 infection is scarce . In a recently published cross - sectional seropreva - lence study on schoolchildren , we were able to define a group of children infected in school settings and another group infected sec - ondarily to their parents . 20 The comprehensive analysis of these chil - dren and almost all their family members provided a unique insight into distinct age - dependent patterns of transmission in households | 5 of 9 SIEBER et al . at the beginning of pandemic . Our data suggest that children may acquire SARS - CoV - 2 and act as a source of infection in households , but the transmission of the virus to other family members occurs infrequently . The overall SAR of SARS - CoV - 2 in households was estimated at 48 % , and differed significantly between households with children and adults acting as a source of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Our observa - tion suggests that children may be less contagious than adults . Only the age of index cases , severity of the disease , and occurrence of lower respiratory symptoms seem to be risk factors associated with higher contagiousness . This observation , although based on a small study group , strengthens the data on a limited role of children in the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission compared with adults . Many recent studies suggest lower risk of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 infection from infected children in both household 8 – 13 , 23 and educational set - tings . 14 – 16 , 18 , 24 In addition , most countries did not observe any significant increase in SARS - CoV - 2 infections after school reopen - ing , with the exception of Israel , where school opening coincided with the opening of other facilities . However , contradictory data on higher or equal infectivity of children in respect to adults have been published as well . 2 – 7 In fact , epidemiological data on the contagiousness of children need to be analyzed with caution . Many transmission studies have a retrospective character and are based on a history of symptoms or a history of positive PCR , and only a few have performed com - prehensive immunological testing of all contacts . Thus , children may be underrepresented due to the lack of or very mild symptoms and consequently less frequently or later performed PCR testing . The possibility of false - negative PCR testing in asymptomatic individuals needs to be acknowledged as well . Furthermore , the risk of secondary infection is not only a matter of contagiousness of the index case but also a matter of susceptibil - ity of the exposed individual , which seems to be overseen in many transmission studies . Many studies suggested lower susceptibility of acquiring SARS - CoV - 2 infection by children . 25 – 30 This trend cannot be observed in our study . Only the age of the index case but not the age of the exposed individual itself was linked to a higher risk of TABLE 1 Confirmation of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among analyzed family members .

The reason for this divergence could be a prospective character of our study and similar proportion of pediatric and adult tested individuals , as well as the fact of serological testing , which revealed asymptomatic / mildly symptomatic individuals as well . It has been suggested that children acquire COVID - 19 mostly at home or through contact with other family members . 19 , 26 , 31 Our study showed a similar proportion of households with pediatric and adult index cases . The distinctness of our findings can be caused , apart from different population selections , by a different time point of the study assessment . Most of the abovementioned studies were conducted during a time when schools were closed and physical distancing was implemented . Under these circumstances , children ' s social contact with others than their household was limited . In con - trary to that , most COVID - 19 infections in our study can be linked to March – April 2020 , when schools were still open and no hygienic measures , such as wearing a facemask or social distancing , were im - plemented yet . Some limitations of our study need to be addressed . Although we tested all individuals regardless of symptoms and found TABLE 2 Contagiousness of index cases and susceptibility of exposed contacts by age .

Asymptomatic individuals might be underrepresented as index cases . Additionally , tertiary transmission within the household is impossible to define . In consequence , all subsequent cases are classified as secondary to the index case . Finally , seropositivity of secondary cases could potentially be caused by a later SARS - CoV - 2 infection , not related to the confirmed infection in the household . This , however , was verified by clinical data and did not reveal any hint of later SARS - CoV - 2 infections . The small sample size does not allow any definitive conclu - sions on population basis ; however , it provides detailed insights into household transmission . Serological testing of almost all family members combined with the history of PCR testing , detailed medical history , and contact tracing assures the possibility of a comprehen - sive analysis of transmission patterns in households . Similar proportion of pediatric and adult index cases provides a unique opportunity for a comparison of age - dependent transmission patterns , which cannot be done in big studies including only a small proportion of pediatric index cases . Although the data from an early stage of the pandemic may not mirror transmissibility in case of new variants of the virus , it provides an opportunity to analyze the patterns of transmission in settings of “normal life . ” In conclusion , our study shows that children can acquire a SARS - CoV - 2 infection in educational settings and at home . In most cases , the infection could be linked to adult index cases infecting the child , rather than a child - to - child transmission . Infected children did not seem to be very contagious to their parents and siblings , despite the close physical contact in the household . In fact , our infected children did not apply any isolation precautions with respect to their relatives during symptom occurrence . The possible explanation for that could be : ( a ) rapid virus neutralization in children and consequently lower virus load , ( b ) mild or minimal symptoms , or ( c ) occurrence of symp - toms with reduced risk of droplet transmissions . This observation , if confirmed in large prospective studies and with new virus variants , could significantly influence COVID - 19 pol - icies in child - care facilities and spare children from unnecessary iso - lation during the ongoing pandemic .
