Introduction The experience report consists of the results gained at the pilot areas by the project partners in the framework of WP 5 and its evaluation . In the first chapter the connection between the applied strategies and tools on pilot areas and the project goals is illustrated in form of mind maps prepared by all the project partners . Their differences reflect the weight of problems to be solved at each pilot area . The second part shows the data which were necessary for solving the local problems and its classification . The third part consists of the questionnaires completed by project partners and in the last part are included the analyses of the questionnaires . 2 .

Template of Data Classification The template is an instrument to evaluate eight tools through the use of soil quality parameters . Each tool is defined by ten parameters at the most . Project partners have their own rules based on their local legislations and possibilities for classifying single parameters and it is necessary to discuss them with local soil specialists . Project partners have already chosen which tool will be dealt with . Agriculture soil quality is assessed by partners of Celje , Prague , Salzburg , Vienna and Bratislava ; Ecosystem soil quality is assessed by partners of Celje , Prague , Salzburg , Vienna , Pulawy ) and Bratislava ; Loss of soil resources is assessed by partners of Celje , Stuttgart , Salzburg , Vienna , Pulawy and Bratislava ) ; Soil contamination is assessed by partners of Celje , Prague , Pulawy and Bratislava ; Water drainage is assessed by partners of Celje , Pulawy and Bratislava ) ; Sealing rate is assessed by partners of Celje , Salzburg , Pulawy ; Connectivity is assessed by partners of Prague , Pulawy and Milano ; Proximity is assessed by partners of Prague and Milano . Soil quality parameters are evaluated based on three or five scale system : good – medium – bad / or very good – good – medium – bad – very bad . The interpretation is done by points from 1 to 3 / or from 1 to 5 whereas 1 describes the best soil quality . The importance of each parameter is considered via weight of the parameters . The weight characteristic moves in range 1 – 3 , whereas three means the highest significance . Soil parameters to be used  Soil quality score : Soil quality was defined as “the capacity of a reference soil to function , within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries , to sustain plant and animal productivity , maintain or enhance water and air quality , and support human health and habitation” . Soil quality index can be read in Soil quality index map designed for some European countries ( European Environment Agency , 2009 ) . Regarding Czech case study , it was going from soil taxation maps and codes ( BPEJ ) . Based on the codes five classes of soil protection are distinguished ; where the first class defines the most valuable soils . The following soil parameters are used for evaluation of soil quality :  Soil organic matter content class – topsoil  Soil pH class – topsoil  Topsoil depth  Soil texture class  Nutrient status  Soil contamination  Soil porosity 12 4 . 1 .

Name : Alexandra Freudenschuß Position : Scientific officer ( soil expert ) Institution : Umweltbundesamt - Environment Agency Austria ( EAA ) PP : 3 1 ) On what device was the software installed ( laptop , PC , server ) ? Server Windows 2003 , installation on PC or laptop did not work ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 2 ) What was the reason for the device choice ? E . g . availability for broader public , software / hardware incompatibility , high costs , etc . Installation on the laptop did not function , server installation was recommended by software developer . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 3 ) Is the chosen device applicable ? Is it accessible for stakeholders , authorities , developers ? At the moment the software it is not accessible for stakeholders / planers outside the EAA ( Environment Agency Austria ) . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 4 ) On how many stations was the installation done ? Are these devices in the same network ( e . g . LAN ) ? The software runs on a central server at EAA . Access to the server is possible from many PC stations via internet explorer . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 5 ) Is the installed Soil Manager Suite system used by different authorities or only by PP members ? 42 So far the SMS system is only used by UBA - A staff and for the time being it is not likely that it will be installed somewhere else , because of technical complexity . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 6 ) Did you experience any troubles while installing the software on windows based operation system ( 98 , 2003 . . . . . ) / linux operation system ? Some problems occurred during the installation process , but those were solved quite fast . Main problems occurred with data preparation and setting up the system with data of the test region of Salzburg . ……………………………………………………………… 7 ) Did you use installation manual and guide documents or did you need CGS help while installing ? Did CGS install the software ? Installation of software was done by PP’s IT experts . However the implementation / installation / setting up of the software tools and with Grass , Maestro Web Guide and database structure required intensive support from CGS and the problems are still not sufficiently and satisfyingly solved . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 8 ) What problems occurred during installation ? How did you solve them ? Problems occurred with the Internet Exchange Server , but where solved from UBA - A IT expert . 9 ) What problems occurred within data uploading ? How did you solve them ? Problems solved with support from CGS : - Projection problems with raster data and background data - Problems with visualisation of raster data - Problems to create result files - Change of input from result files ( e . g . result NS ) to input as layer - Performance problems Problems not solved : - Inclusion from data sets from another test region ( e . g . Vienna ) - Inclusion of additional data sets with higher resolution ………… 10 ) Did you upload the data yourself or CGS support was needed ? Several times the support from CGS was needed ( via team viewer connection ) . Not all problems are solved so far . …………………………………………………………………………………… 43 11 ) What data format was used ? Test data are available as ArcGIS shp files . ……………………………………………………………………………………… 12 ) Did you have all required tool parameters ? If not how did you compensate missing data ? In a first step ESQ and ASQ tool were applied . Data for nutrient status and soil contamination are not available for the test region RVS , therefore missing data were compensated by default values ( value 2 – middle class of evaluation ) and weight 0 . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 13 ) Did you encounter any problems while applying compensated data ? How did you solve the problems ? Reliability of gained results could not be validated so far . It seems that the equation and other weights used need a detailed and thorough check and validation . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 14 ) Do you plan to spread the software to other workplaces ( e . g . other municipality , other cities , developers , universities ) ? No , installation and implementation is too complicated . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 15 ) Point out the main problems you encounter with software implementation . Implementation of soil manager suite requires special software knowledge ( Grass , Map Guide Maestro ) . Main problems identified : - projection issues with raster files , - transformation process from polygon to raster files ( - > not solved at the moment , standard format ) - setting up result files of ASQ and ESQ , - changes in software script required when NS and SCfood do not refer to a result file , but are single input layers , - Guidelines are not sufficient and detailed enough in some parts ( careful points in transformation process polygon to raster by Arc GIS ) ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 16 ) Recommendation for improvements . CGS support at PPs place , difficult to communicate all problems via mail or Team Viewer sessions , time consuming process and this leads some times to misunderstandings 44 between PPs and CGS people . However the CGS support was always very helpful and professional . …………………………………………………………………………………………… 17 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . Strong points : - high flexibility of tool to include / exclude parameters for evaluation , - once the data are classified and running in the system – adaptation for local needs via administration tool ( weights , equation of parameters , stratification of results ) is very user friendly Weak points : - good software skills of Grass / Maestro are important , - data upload to the system is a time consuming process - problems with projections and raster files , - Legends of parameterised input layers are not visible , - Stable run of system is not guaranteed , - not possible to run one tool on two different data sets - Visualisation of two or more test regions e . g . Salzburg and Vienna is not possible with the application – need further information from CGS people – problem not solved so far . 45 DRAFT GUIDANCE FOR SOIL IN SEA / EIA Based on experiences from “Draft guidance for soil in SEA / EIA” implementation please write comments to each of the points . Name : Markus Leitner Position : scientific officer Institution : Umweltbundesamt - Environment Agency Austria PP : 3 1 ) Does the document contribute to better soil protection in SEA / EIA process ? The document gives an overview and a maximum list of soil issues that need to be considered when performing an EIA / SEA ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 2 ) Which part do you consider to be the most important ? I consider the draft guidance from page 33 - 55 the most important part ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 3 ) Which part should be elaborated more deeply ? I think the most important part is a short and smart checklist that can be applied by all partners ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 4 ) What do you miss in the document ? A short checklist of soil issues that need to be considered in both , EIA and SEA ………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… …… 5 ) What problems appeared during implementation ? The guidance was not applied in the test area . EIA processes were already running and the guidance was seen as a very useful document . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 46 47 6 ) How did you solve them ? We are now developing checklists for EIA and SEA and include them in the updated Guidance document ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 7 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… …………………………………………………………………………………………… COMPENSATION MEASURES ; BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT Based on experiences from “Guidance on compensation measures” and “Report brownfield redevelopment testing” implementation please write comments to each of the points . Name : Tulipan Monika Position : scientific officer / soil expert Institution : Umweltbundesamt - Environment Agency Austria PP : 3 1 ) Is the compensation measures description sufficient and understandable to be used practically ? …… Yes definitely , it provides a good overview with concrete examples and detailed description as well as an assessment of the single methods related to soil functions . It can be seen as a good basis for practical implementation . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………… 2 ) Which chapters would you like to have elaborated in detail ? … Chapter 5 can be considered as the most important for practical application , so the addition of further examples and more detailed information ( e . g . a list of “state of the Art” literature on single compensation methods e . g . for different countries ) could be helpful to concretise methodical basics and make them easier accessible ………………………………………………………………………………………… Also chapter 6 can be considered as very helpful for assessment of soil functions and effects of compensation measures – it would be challenging to have some quantification to describe the effects on soil functions – that would facilitate assessment particularly in SEA or EIA ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 3 ) Are any important points missing in the document ? … no ………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… … 48 49 4 ) Is the Report brownfield redevelopment testing sufficient and understandable for utilisation ? ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 5 ) Which chapters would you like to have elaborated in detail ? ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 6 ) What problems did you deal with during implementation ? ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 7 ) How did you solve the problems ? ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 8 ) Is it possible to apply the documents for the process of soil quality classification via Soil Manager Suite ? ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 9 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… TEMPLATE OF DATA CLASSIFICATION Based on experiences from “Template of data evaluation” testing please write comments to each of the points .

Cap 11 , Table pages 41 , 42 to 49 , 50 ( all the chapeter ) 3 ) Which part should be elaborated more deeply ? Cas studies : it would be useful to point out where , in practical cases , necessary in - depth examinations were missing 4 ) What do you miss in the document ? No evidence of missing issues , at least at a general level 5 ) What problems appeared during implementation ? No implementation up to now . 6 ) How did you solve them ? n / a 7 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . Any guideline is outdates in the moment it is applied , it shouldn ' t be considered as a stable achievement but as an evolutive process . 55 COMPENSATION MEASURES ; BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT Based on experiences from “Guidance on compensation measures” and “Report brownfield redevelopment testing” implementation please write comments to each of the points . Name : Achille Rossi Position : Head of Dept Executive Building Plans and Programs Institution : Municipality of Milano PP : 4 1 ) Is the compensation measures description sufficient and understandable to be used practically ? Yes 2 ) Which chapters would you like to have elaborated in detail ? Chapter 8 on " Strategic Suitability " of compensation measures could be developed a bit more 3 ) Are any important points missing in the document ? No 4 ) Is the Report brownfield redevelopment testing sufficient and understandable for utilisation ? It is not very clear the difference between the 2 documents ( maybe because the technology sheets are very similar ) 5 ) Which chapters would you like to have elaborated in detail ? Technology sheets , comprehending also costs . 6 ) What problems did you deal with during implementation ? No implementation up to now . 7 ) How did you solve the problems ? ……………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 8 ) Is it possible to apply the documents for the process of soil quality classification via Soil Manager Suite ? The question isn ' t clear to us 56 57 9 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . The identification of guidelines and manuals is not clear , it ' s difficult to understand which doc is supposed to do what unless and in - depth analysis is carried on ( which cannot be expected by non - specialists ) CELJE SOIL MANAGER SUITE – SYSTEM SOFTWARE - TESTING Based on experiences from software installation and data application please write comments to each of the points . Name : Peter Medved Position : employee , project manager Institution : City of Celje PP : 06 1 ) On what device was the software installed ( laptop , PC , server ) ? Software is installed on HP BL460C G1 E5430 2G , RAM 4GB , hard disc 300 GB server . Programme software supporting its work is WS Enterprise for server . 2 ) What was the reason for the device choice ? E . g . availability for broader public , software / hardware incompatibility , high costs , etc . Because there was no space on current servers , expected needs for software when preparing project application and planned need for software production and testing SMS Suite we needed to provide new server for URBAN - SMS project . 3 ) Is the chosen device applicable ? Is it accessible for stakeholders , authorities , developers ? Yes , it is fully applicable . With some minor upgrade we were also able to let other project partners to access our data base and developed tools . It is currently accessible to project team , project partners representatives and chosen authorities from the city Spatial and Environmental Department . If needed it is also accessible to stakeholders . After project finalisation it will also be available to the public ( probably only already made final tables and pictures ) . 4 ) On how many stations was the installation done ? Are these devices in the same network ( e . g . LAN ) ? On our server . From there it is accessible to everyone who expresses a desire to test it . 58 5 ) Is the installed Soil Manager Suite system used by different authorities or only by PP members ? Currently is the system used only by City of Celje employees ( apart project partners ) . 6 ) Did you experience any troubles while installing the software on windows based operation system ( 98 , 2003 . . . . . ) / linux operation system ? We did not try this installation . As from the beginning system was installed on server . But we needed an upgrade of server operation system . 7 ) Did you use installation manual and guide documents or did you need CGS help while installing ? Did CGS install the software ? Basically we did not use installation manual as all work connected with installation was done by CGS and AIS . Probably without some of their help installation would be a longer process . 8 ) What problems occurred during installation ? How did you solve them ? Actually with installation were no bigger problems and were solved quickly between AIS and CGS . 9 ) What problems occurred within data uploading ? How did you solve them ? No problems occurs as geospatial frame for chosen area was properly defined in the programme . 10 ) Did you upload the data yourself or CGS support was needed ? AIS has done the upload of the data for us . 11 ) What data format was used ? We mostly used shapes ( with polygon vector data ) and point samples data . 12 ) Did you have all required tool parameters ? If not how did you compensate missing data ? We had most of the required parameters . During testing we realised some data need to be upgraded - more detailed ( polygon soil data , real land use ) so we ordered new maps , which were mostly finished until 31 . 8 . 2011 . This is the reason for new series of test and a small delay with final results . 13 ) Did you encounter any problems while applying compensated data ? How did you solve the problems ? No . 59 60 14 ) Do you plan to spread the software to other workplaces ( e . g . other municipality , other cities , developers , universities ) ? Yes . We plan to integrate it into working procedures of our spatial department . By the end of this year we will organise an in - house seminar as also local workshop , open for interested developers , municipalities , university professors , etc . Where we will present our results and possible usefulness of developed tools . 15 ) Point out the main problems you encounter with software implementation . Perhaps a complex and extensive installation process . 16 ) Recommendation for improvements . Regarding the software is running on free platform perhaps even more developed process of the installation which would be more end user friendly ( few mouse clicks installation ) . And , if not having a server available , a desktop computer consistent version . 17 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . We miss an option to export final report map as a new layer for further analysis or to just import it into operating GIS where it is then used for overlaying with existing spatial maps . COMPENSATION MEASURES ; BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT Based on experiences from “Guidance on compensation measures” and “Report brownfield redevelopment testing” implementation please write comments to each of the points . Name : Peter Medved Position : employee , project manager Institution : City of Celje PP : 06 1 ) Is the compensation measures description sufficient and understandable to be used practically ? Yes , it can be used practically because it is understandable . 2 ) Which chapters would you like to have elaborated in detail ? Perhaps when talking about direct measure of green roofs etc . There could be stated what amount / depth of soil is a minimum to be able to talk compensation was sufficient . 3 ) Are any important points missing in the document ? We think nothing important is missing . 4 ) Is the Report brownfield redevelopment testing sufficient and understandable for utilisation ? Have we overlooked this report ? Or is still in preparation phase ? 5 ) Which chapters would you like to have elaborated in detail ? / ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 6 ) What problems did you deal with during implementation ? / ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 7 ) How did you solve the problems ? / ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 8 ) Is it possible to apply the documents for the process of soil quality classification via Soil Manager Suite ? Yes , with the tool Loss of soil resource ( and Soil contamination ) area and soil quality loss can be calculated and further used for compensation measures based on this values . Perhaps only a direct digital result made in Soil Manager Suite is missing to directly use results in further analysis . 9 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . / ………………………………… 61 TEMPLATE OF DATA CLASSIFICATION Based on experiences from “Template of data evaluation” testing please write comments to each of the points . Name : Peter Medved Position : employee , project manager Institution : City of Celje PP : 06 1 ) What legislation / guidelines / directives / documents have been used for evaluation of soil contamination ? We used national Regulation for limit values , action values and critical values of dangerous values in soil ( in use since 1996 ) . 2 ) What background documents have been used for evaluation of soil parameters ? a . pH b . organic matter c . soil texture d . nutrient status class e . other parameters AIS has evaluated for us current soil status based on available national or local ( soil contamination ) soil parameters and national legislation defining agricultural soil quality . Additional evaluation will be made shortly on basis of new , detailed soil map done for our city . 3 ) Is the evaluation system transparent and understandable ? Yes , we think with possible adoptions when defining parameters limits the system is usable . 4 ) What should be changed ? Actually nothing . There already exists option to import and to set target values in use in partner city / region / country . 5 ) Do you consider the software application and classification to be in native language ? We think it is much easier for municipal experts , local developers and decision makers when the software and the reports in native language . Therefore we will , 62 after finalisation of all tools within SMS try to translate tools and reports into Slovene language . 6 ) Is it necessary to predefine the HEX colour palette ? Instead HEX palette we will use RGB as it is more common in our country . We think it is not necessary to predefine it – it can be defined for single purpose and need for further analysis . 7 ) Is it necessary to have the option to compare data classification ? ( Now it is not possible . Common evaluation model would be required ! ) . We do not understand this question very good . What is meant by option to compare data ? They are already put into classes based on national target limits . Should this comparison be made with classification in other countries ? If so , we would support this need . 8 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . It is hard to make a common classification and number of classes to be appropriate for all partners and countries . Because for some 3 are enough , other have legislation based on 5 classes . . . From soil experts a common target values should be defined and confirmed with EU legislation / regulative . As it is already done for water , air target limits , emissions and overall quality . 63 WROCLAV SOIL MANAGER SUITE – SYSTEM SOFTWARE - TESTING Based on experiences from software installation and data application please write comments to each of the points .

How did you solve them ? … First significant installation problem was unsuccessful installation on Polish version of Windows Server 2003 . GRASS scripts were not starting and the problem was related to script enabling through Message Queue . The application was successfully installed , however very important was the order of installation of the system components . The proper order is not described in the „UrbanSMS . WP4 . Web _ SWinstalationManual” . The problem appears during installation of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 that requires updating Windows Installer 4 . 5 . Map Guide attached to the software does not install with the Windows Installer 4 . 5 . Therefore the Map Guide must be installed before installation of MS SQL Server 2008 . There was a problem with configuration of Urban SMS application . In the file „web . config” there are configuration keys : „key = " urlPage " ” and „key = " urlRoot " ” that define the address of WWW server . When defining the keys as “localhost’ the internet service works only on local computer , not within Intranet or Internet . Definition through IP address makes it available to a network . It is not a problem when the computer works with routable IP ( public IP ) . However in case the it works with router with NAT ( network address translation ) on private IP number , the service is available in Intranet and Internet depending on the defined IP address … 9 ) What problems occurred within data uploading ?

Yes , because elaboration of soil aspects in SEA / EIA process will be more transparent and understandable . 2 ) Which part do you consider to be the most important ? As the important parts we consider list of soil topics to be assessed and impacts assessment definitions 3 ) Which part should be elaborated more deeply ? Each part is elaborated in detail . Maybe better distinguishing of SEA and EIA topic definition . It seems to be the same . 4 ) What do you miss in the document ? Practically nothing 5 ) What problems appeared during implementation ? There is a problem of data acquisition and reworking . To obtain many data is really time - consuming matter . 6 ) How did you solve them ? We did not solve any EIA / SEA project in practice 7 ) Other comments , suggestions , weaknesses or strong points . As referring EIA case study we have found one disproportion – in the brownfield area – toxic chemical waste dump do not require any EIA assessment if any developer plans project having less than 500 apartments . That is strange as each contaminated site represents risk of potential pollution and building of residential area in the vicinity contaminated site is doubtful . We propose to make EIA process for each contaminated brownfield . 80 81 COMPENSATION MEASURES ; BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT Based on experiences from “Guidance on compensation measures” and “Report brownfield redevelopment testing” implementation please write comments to each of the points .

Analyses of Questionaires for WP5 Analyses of questionairies for WP5 1 ) Soil manager suite – system software – testing First question was aimed on the technical background . In seven cases the software was installed on servers , only in one case ( Stuttgart ) was installed on laptop . Problems with further distribution of this software could be divided into two groups :  Lack of availability of municipal servers or not adequate free space on hard discs  It was not allowed to install foreign program on official hardware of municipalities . Some restrains in further use of software was in some cases caused by not adequate quality of hardware or by not suitable location of the server ( Vienna ) or it is not planned to distribute it for further public use . In Prague is system still tested and in future it is planned to persuade stakeholders to exploit it . In four cases ( Bratislava , Wroclaw , Milano and Celje ) it will be available for appropriate authorities and for developers . The installation of the tested software was usually done on one server and it is available for the local networks . In Celje it is available for all volunteers willing to test it now and now it is used by different departments of the City Council . The software was found demanding for the capacity of computers . If it was installed on Windows 2003 system there were almost no problems , but it is no more available on the PC market . The version of 2008 was not suitable . The installation was done by project partners without help in one case only ( Salzburg ) . Some project partners used the Guide but with some help of CGS . In majority of cases the help of CGS was needed and appreciated . The only serious problem was that two partners did not get permission to install the software on the official hardware . In all other cases the technical problems pilot areas partners tried to solve with help of CGS . Data loading process showed some difficulties in several cases . In Celje only there were no problems , because CGS tested the software on that locality . The other partners had to follow prescribed format strictly . In case of Wroclaw there was a problem with data analysis , because they applied it on a very large territory and the resolution was too high . The format of data was mainly ESRI grid , 10 m resolution and shapefiles . Lack of some data was no problem in Wroclaw . Prague partners resampled the studied area . Vienna partners exploited soil quality maps . The other partners found the way how to substitute missing data by expert judgment . 90 Application of compensation measures differed among project partners . Salzburg partners only came to conclusion that reliability of gained results was not validate so far . For the other partner it was not a substantial problem . Spreading the software to other workplaces was planned mainly in Celje . This partner plans to integrate it into working procedures of their spatial departments . They will organize an in - house seminar and local workshops open for developers , municipalities and universities . As the main problem almost all partners consider the installation process , which is not end users friendly . Some partners miss an option to export final report map as a new layer for further analysis . Majority of partners would appreciate the reports written in the local language . It could be concluded that majority of partners consider the tested software a very useful . Its future use however depends on it improvement . 2 ) Evaluation of questionnaires on compensation measures and brownfield redevelopment . All the partners considered the description of the compensation measures sufficient , clear and understandable . It provides a good overview with concrete examples and detailed description as well as an assessment of single methods related to soil functions and it can be seen as a good bases for practical implementation . The problem was found in the case of brownfield redevelopment . Some partners stated that the national legislative differs in each country . The others complained that this point was not sufficiently developed . The majority of partners considered it possible to apply compensation measures by Soil Manager Suite , because this tool can assess in what extent the soil functions would be lost in urban development process and what are the needs to compensate this loss . 3 ) Evaluation of questionnaires on data classification The answers on the question what legislation have been used for evaluation of soil contamination differed substantially . This was logical result . In each country there exists national legislative for this purpose . As a background documents for evaluation of soil parameters were used also different sources : national threshold values ( Poland ) , expert estimation ( Slovakia ) , parameters and national legislative of agricultural soil quality ( Slovenia ) , and of Austria , results of soil mapping ( Germany ) and soil survey evaluation methodology ( Czech Republic ) . 91 92 All the partners considered the evaluation system adequately transparent and understandable . The majority of partners consider as useful the software application and data classification to be in native language . 4 ) Evaluation of questionnaires on guidance for soil in SEA / EIA The document is generally considered as a good contribution to the better soil protection . Some partners emphasised the fact , that application of this document will , make the process more transparent and understandable . The partners view on the assessment of the most important part of the document differed but majority considered as a most important the table of SEA assessment and the Guidence for Soil in EIA / SEA – chapter 11 . The answer on the question which part should be elaborated deeply was almost uniform from majority of respondents . They considered the document detailed enough . The project partners did not miss anything in the document . The main problem in application of this document was found in the fact that until , now in all involved countries should be followed the national legislative . The partners from Bratislava complied on necessity to obtain many data and time consuming procedure . This partner suggested also the necessity to apply EIA process , on each contaminated brownfield . Some partners suggested to shorten the document .
