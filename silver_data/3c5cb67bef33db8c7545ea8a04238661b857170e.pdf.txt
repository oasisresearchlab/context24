Protected amino acids and Fmoc - Gly - Sasrin resin were obtained from Advanced ChemTech Europe ( Brussels , Belgium ) , Bachem Biochimie SARL ( Voisins - Les - Bretonneux , France ) and France Biochem S . A . ( Meudon , France ) . All amino - acids belong to the L - series . PyBOP was purchased from France Biochem . Analytical RP - HPLC was performed on Waters system equipped with a Waters 600 controller and a Waters 2487 Dual Absorbance Detector . Analysis was carried out at 1 . 0 mL / min ( EC 125 / 3 nucleosil 300 - 5 C 18 ) with UV monitoring at 214 nm and 250 nm using a linear A – B gradient ( buffer A : 0 . 09 % CF 3 CO 2 H in water ; buffer B : 0 . 09 % CF 3 CO 2 H in 90 % acetonitrile ) . Preparative HPLC was performed on Gilson GX 281 equiped with a fraction collector . Purifications were carried out at 22 . 0 mL / min ( VP 250 / 21 nucleosil 100 - 7 C 18 ) with UV monitoring at 214 nm and 250 nm using a linear A – B gradient ( buffer A : 0 . 09 % CF 3 CO 2 H in water ; buffer B : 0 . 09 % CF 3 CO 2 H in 90 % acetonitrile ) . Molecular modelling of compound 3b Structure calculations were performed using InsightII / Discover ( Version 2005 , Accelrys , SanDiego , CA , USA ) software . Calculations were performed in vacuo , and the energy of the system was calculated by the consistent CVFF force field ( version 2 . 3 ) . To shorten the range of Coulomb interaction , a distance - dependent relative dielectric constant , ε r , was used ( ε r = 4r ) . The resulting molecule was subjected to 2500 iterations of steepest descent minimization , followed by 5000 iterations of conjugate gradient minimization and the convergence of minimization was followed until the RMS derivative was less than 0 . 01 kcal . mol - 1 . Compound 3b was constructed by using the model of 2 that was previously proposed from NMR data . 12d Mannose units were removed and replaced by 16 cyclodecapeptides containing the fucosyl groups . Energy minimisation showed that compound 3b is stable and no steric clashes were observed . This result point out that our construct can well accommodate a large number of sugar residues . For clarity the arms have been spread out .
