Early detection in association with staging or grading the tumor is the most effective method to increase survival rates . Studies have revealed that cortactin overexpression may play a role in the final stages of tumor progression and affects invasion and cellular motility . The aim of this study is to evaluate cortactin gene expression among Iranian female patients with breast cancer . Materials and Methods : Samples belonging to 70 breast cancer patients were randomly selected from the Imam Khomeini tumor bank . Normal and tumor tissues were prepared and stored at −80˚C . Cortactin gene expression was evaluated by real - time PCR . Finally the data , along with demographic and clinical parameters , were analyzed using Prism 5 . 0 software , followed by t - test and ANOVA analysis . Results : Cortactin gene expression among tumor tissues increased 95 . 71 % in com - parison with normal tissues . A significant correlation between cortactin gene expres - sion and lymph nodes’ involvement ( P = 0 . 0077 ) and tumor stage ( P = 0 . 0030 ) was observed . However , tumor grade ( P = 0 . 8598 ) , tumor size ( P = 0 . 3058 ) , and patient’s age ( P = 0 . 4135 ) had no significant correlation with the gene’s expression level . Dis - cussion : This study demonstrated that the cortactin gene’s overexpression in breast cancer may enhance lymph nodes’ involvement . This study also found that the gene’s expression was raised significantly in progressed stages of the cancer . Therefore , cor - tactin gene overexpression is an important factor indicating breast cells’ invasion . Conclusion : The cortactin gene’s expression level can be considered an accurate in - dicator for female breast cancer and also an appropriate biomarker for this cancer in clinical evaluations .

Introduction At the beginning of the 20th century , with the brilliant medical developments that led to control of infectious disease , few could imagine that non - communicable diseases ( NCDs ) would offer the strongest clinical challenge in the next century . It is estimated that 38 million people die due to NCDs annually , and nearly three quarters of them ( 28 million ) live in less - developed countries [ 1 ] . Cancer , a major public health problem worldwide , is currently the second - leading cause of death , causing over 8 million deaths a year , second only to cardiovascular diseases , and cancer is expected to surpass cardi - ovascular diseases as a cause of death within the next few years [ 2 ] . Due to population growth and the aging of the population , cancer rates are increasing . In addition , the general risk factors for NCDs , such as smoking , overweight , physical inactivity , and changing reproductive patterns in association with urbanization and economic devel - opment are raising cancer rates [ 3 ] . Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both sexes in developed countries , while breast cancer remains the most preva - lent cause of death among females in less - developed countries [ 4 ] . In countries with powerful economies , thanks to developments in early detection methods and improved treatments , cancer incidence and mortality rates are decreasing [ 5 ] . However , the data demonstrate that in many countries of South America , Africa , and Asia cancer rates have been increasing , most likely due to lifestyle changes [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . Breast cancer is among the five most common cancers in Iranian women . Although Iranian women are famili - ar with the disease [ 8 ] , the incidence of breast cancer is rising ; most Iranian females suffer from later developed stages ( III or IV ) , and they are also relatively younger ( about 10 years ) than their Western counterparts [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . Breast cancer is a heterogeneous association of tumors that have different clinical , pathologic , and radiographic indications [ 11 ] . Ductal and lobular carcinomas are the two most common histologic types of invasive breast cancer [ 12 ] . In addition , breast cancer can be classified via different commonly - used methods , including staging the tumor through the TNM system [ 13 ] [ 14 ] , and grading the tumor through the Not - tingham grading system , or the Scarf - Bloom - Richardson system [ 15 ] [ 16 ] . To reduce mortality rates and improve the patients’ prognosis , early detection in association with staging or grading the tumor is used [ 17 ] . The cortactin gene ( CTTN ) is located on the amplicon 11q13 , which is often re - ported to be overexpressed in human cancers , such as breast and bladder cancers , and esophagus , epithelium , and hepatocellular carcinomas [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . Recent studies indi - cated that cellular motility increased , and no cell - to - cell cohesion was necessary for tumor progression . Cortactin is among the most important actin - assembling proteins [ 20 ] . Cortactin’s ability to interact with cytoskeleton proteins via the SH3 domain S . Reza et al . 144 makes it correlate with a variety of processes , such as endocytosis and cell migration . This protein is also responsible for invadopodia formation . Cancer cells decompose the extra - cellular matrix through the invadopodia used for cell migration [ 21 ] . Cortactin phosphorylation , acetylation , and deacetylation have been demonstrated , which are as - sumed to be important for cancer progression [ 22 ] . Although cortactin’s action within tumor progression is not clearly understood , it seems that high expression of CTTN correlates with patients’ worse prognosis or disease relapse . This means that CTTN overexpression may play a role in the final stages of tumor progression . Studies also re - veal that CTTN overexpression does not lead to morphological changes , and it does not affect proliferation but instead influences invasion and cellular motility [ 18 ] [ 23 ] . In this study , we evaluated cortactin gene expression among Iranian female patients with breast cancer to determine the correlation between cortactin gene expression with tumor size , grade and stage and also patients’ age . 2 . Material and Methods Population study and tissue specimens : Seventy female patients suffering from breast cancer , who were under the treatment at the Imam Khomeini hospital from 2013 - 2014 , were evaluated . Informed consent was obtained from each patient . Samples were ob - tained from the Imam Khomeini hospital’s tumor bank . Each sample then was stored at −80˚C until testing was performed . RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis : RNA extraction was performed using the Tri - Pure Isolation Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Roche , Ger - many ) . RNA quantity analysis was approached spectrophotometrically . cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit ( Roshe , Mannheim , Germany ) ac - cording to the manufacturer’s instructions . Sequences of CTTN and GAPDH mRNAs were obtained from the NCBI database , and the desired primers were designed utilizing Primer 3 software ( Table 1 ) . Real - time PCR was evaluated using a Rotor Gene 6000 ( Corbett Research , Australia ) apparatus . Statistical analysis : For each sample two reactions were applied and final output was calculated as the mean of two repeats . For final statistical analysis Prism 5 . 0 software was used . According to the obtained TCs from real - time PCR , genes’ relationships were assessed via the 2 ^ - ΔCt formula with clinical parameters among patients with breast cancer . Statistical significance of each parameter was analyzed by ANOVA ( P ≤ 0 . 05 ) and t - test . Table 1 . Primer sequences for CTTN and GAPDH target genes .

Results Pathological information : Samples were provided from the Imam Khomeini hospital tumor bank , including 70 tumor samples and 5 normal tissue samples that were utilized as controls . Patients’ clinical and pathologic characteristics were recorded ( Table 2 ) . CTTN gene expression : level of CTTN gene expression among normal and tumor tissues : CTTN gene expression among tumor tissues was increased 95 . 71 % in compari - son with normal tissues ( Figure 1 ) . The correlation between the level of CTTN gene expression and lymph node in - volvement , tumor grade , tumor stage , tumor size , and patient’s age were evaluated . Table 2 .

CTTN gene expression levels : Thirty patients ( 47 . 14 % ) had a low level of CTTN ex - pression ( + ) , while 20 patients ( 28 . 67 % ) displayed a moderate CTTN expression ( + + ) , and there was a high expression ( + + + ) of the gene in 17 patients ( 24 . 29 % ) . The comparison between these different groups was performed by t - test and ANOVA . * mean P value < 0 . 0001 . S . Reza et al . 146 A significant correlation between CTTN gene expression and lymph nodes’ involve - ment and tumor stage were observed . According to the results , the CTTN expression level was higher among patients who had lymph nodes’ involvement ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . Patients with cancer are classified based on their tumor stage : I , II , III , and IV . Due to Figure 2 . The correlation between the level of CTTN gene expression and lymph node in - volvement ( a ) , tumor grade ( b ) , tumor stage ( c ) , tumor size ( d ) , and patient’s age ( e ) . S . Reza et al . 147 metastasis to other organs or areas of the body , such as the liver , brain , and bones , stage IV patients were excluded . In addition , due to the small size of the sample groups , stage I and stage II patients were merged into one group , and patients at stage III were con - sidered a separate group . Based on results between CTTN gene expression and disease stage , a significant correlation was observed ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . However , tumor grade ( Figure 2 ( c ) ) , tumor size ( Figure 2 ( d ) ) , and patient’s age ( Figure 2 ( e ) ) revealed no significant correlation . 4 . Discussion This study’s results revealed that the cortactin gene’s expression was increased in 95 . 71 % of tumor samples . Cortactin is an action - binding protein . Its overexpression prevents cell junctions , facilitating tumor’s spread [ 24 ] . Despite indications of cortac - tin’s overexpression effects on carcinoma cell migration , invasion , and metastasis , its exact mechanism of action in cancer progression is not yet completely understood [ 25 ] . In this study , evaluating cortactin gene expression and lymph nodes’ involvement demonstrated that this gene’s overexpression in breast cancer may enhance lymph nodes’ involvement . In addition , the gene’s expression was raised significantly at more progressed stages of cancer . In agreement with this study’s results , Tsai et al . investi - gated the correlation of cortactin expression with gastric adenocarcinoma clinical pa - rameters through immunohistochemical and tissue microarray analysis [ 26 ] . They de - termined that cortactin overexpression had a direct relationship with more progressed stages of that cancer . In addition , Sang Jae et al . reported cortactin overexpression among 58 % of non - small cell lung cancer patients [ 27 ] and cortactin overexpression was remarkably asso - ciated with other clinical factors , including tumor size , and lymph nodes’ involvement . Chen et al . ’s 2011 survey of breast cancer patients , using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray , revealed that 23 . 2 % of the patients had low CTTN expression ( + ) , 60 . 6 % had moderate CTTN expression ( + + ) , and 16 . 2 % indicated high levels of CTTN expression ( + + + ) . However , Chen et al . did not report a significant correlation between cortactin expression and age , tumor grade , lymph nodes’ circumstances , or tumor stage , which could result from the cancer’s heterogeneity [ 20 ] . In other studies that evaluated cortactin gene expression among a variety of cancers , the gene’s overexpression was in direct correlation with cancer cell invasion and proli - feration capability . Subsequently , based on this study’s results , it could be claimed that cortactin gene overexpression is an important factor in breast cells’ invasion . However , no significant correlation was observed between the studied gene’s expression and tu - mor grade or size . The small sample size used in this study may be the cause for this result . Higher expression of the gene among the patients belonging to the elder age group , however this result was not statistically significant . 5 . Conclusion According to the results of this study , the cortactin gene expression level can be consi - S . Reza et al . 148 dered an indicator for female breast cancer and also an appropriate biomarker for this cancer in clinical evaluations . Subsequently , molecular inhibitors , including micro RNAs , can be designed to prevent the protein production by this gene and to restrict its action , and therefore the progression of breast tumors . Despite the valuable informa - tion garnered from this study , which improved our understanding of invasive behavior , metastasis mechanisms , and control methods for breast carcinoma cells , more studies are needed to carry these findings further .
