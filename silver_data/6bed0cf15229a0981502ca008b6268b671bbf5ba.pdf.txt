Author’s response to reviews Title : Student progress decision - making in programmatic assessment : can we extrapolate from clinical decision - making and jury decision - making ? Authors : Mike Tweed ( mike . tweed @ otago . ac . nz ) Timothy Wilkinson ( tim . wilkinson @ otago . ac . nz ) Version : 2 Date : 23 Apr 2019 Author’s response to reviews : I did notice , however , various errors of punctuation in the piece , comma splices and misplaced / absent commas being the most prevalent , and these need correcting . Please check the grammar of the manuscript once more . We have had the manuscript proof read and made several improvements to punctuation and grammar . We have included a tracked changes version to enable visibility of multiple small changes . The passing comment re the wisdom of crowds [ p11 ] I found a little odd as this was presented as if it were an unalloyed good and an uncontested concept , neither of which is without its problems . The notion that the average of many individuals’ estimates is close to reality is , I would argue , ontologically flawed in that it assumes that there is , in all cases , a single reality and that there is agreement as to the interpretation of that reality . I would suggest that this sentence be nuanced somewhat and made less definitive . We have changed the wording , in an attempt to re - iterate that this is a mathematical phenomena and not applicable to all cases eg those with narrative data , or when the aggregation of judgments is by discourse rather than averaging . Please ensure the manuscript on the PDF matches the title entered into the submission system . This has been done .
