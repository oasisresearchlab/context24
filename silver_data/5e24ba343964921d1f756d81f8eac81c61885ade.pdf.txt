First published July 28 , 2006 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajplung . 00055 . 2006 . —In patients requiring mechanical ventilation for acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , tidal volume reduction decreases mortality , but the mecha - nisms of the protective effect have not been fully explored . To test the hypothesis that alveolar macrophage activation is an early and critical event in the initiation of ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) , rats were ventilated with high tidal volume ( HV T ) for 10 min to 4 h . Alveolar macrophage counts in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) ﬂuid decreased 45 % by 20 min of HV T ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) consistent with activation - associated adhesion . Depletion of alveolar macrophages in vivo with liposomal clodronate signiﬁcantly decreased permeability and pulmonary edema followin g 4 h of HV T ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) . BAL ﬂuid from rats exposed to 20 min of HV T increased nitric oxide synthase activity nearly threefold in naı¨ve primary alveolar macrophages ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) indicating that soluble factors present in the air spaces contribute to macrophage activation in VILI . Media from cocultures of alveolar epithelial cell monolayers and alveolar macrophages exposed to 30 min of stretch in vitro also signiﬁcantly increased nitrite production in naı¨ve macrophages ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) , but media from stretched alveolar epithelial cells or primary alveolar macrophages alone did not , sug - gesting alveolar epithelial cell - macrophage interaction was required for the subsequent macrophage activation observed . These data dem - onstrate that injurious mechanical ventilation rapidly activates alveo - lar macrophages and that alveolar macrophages play an important role in the initial pathogenesis of VILI . alveolar epithelial barrier function ; ventilator - associated lung injury ; acute lung injury ; acute respiratory distress syndrome MECHANICAL VENTILATION with excessive end - inspiratory volume contributes to mortality in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . The patho - genesis of ventilator - associated lung injury is incompletely understood ; however , both clinical and experimental ventila - tor - attributable lung injury are characterized by activation of the inﬂammatory response ( 12 ) . For example , a variety of pro - and anti - inﬂammatory mediators have been correlated with mechanical ventilation strategy in both experimental and clin - ical studies , including IL - 1 (cid:2) , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and IL - 10 ( 5 , 28 , 33 , 34 ) . Previous reports have indicated that in vitro mechanical strain induces IL - 8 release from alveolar epithelial - like ( A549 ) cells and alveolar macrophages ( 32 , 38 ) . Because neutrophils contribute to ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) ( 3 ) , the release of neutrophil chemokines such as IL - 8 likely consti - tutes an early step in the pathogenesis of VILI . Although animal studies using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybrid - ization techniques have shown that a variety of lung cells produce inﬂammatory mediators in VILI ( 7 ) , the relative con - tributions of resident lung cell types to the pathogenesis of VILI has not been fully explored . We hypothesized that alve - olar macrophages have a central role in the initiation of VILI . The primary objective of the present study was to determine if alveolar macrophages contribute to the increase in lung vascu - lar and alveolar epithelial permeability characteristic of exper - imental VILI using a previously described macrophage deple - tion technique ( 19 ) . A second objective was to determine if injurious mechanical strain activates alveolar macrophages by inducing the release of soluble mediators from alveolar epithe - lial cells , or by a direct affect on alveolar macrophages . METHODS This protocol conforms to National Institutes of Health animal care and use guidelines and was approved by the University of California , San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) . Clodronate liposome preparation and delivery . Liposomes were prepared as previously described ( 19 ) . Brieﬂy , liposomes were com - posed of phosphatidylserine , phosphatidylcholine , and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 1 : 6 : 4 in chloroform . The lipid solution was dried under low vacuum and dissolved in diethyl ether . A clodronate ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) stock solution or PBS was added , and the mixture was placed under nitrogen and sonicated for 3 min . The ether was then removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure at 30°C . Any gel phase that formed was disrupted by vortexing the sample to facilitate the removal of ether . The liposome suspension was then repeatedly extruded through 200 - nm ﬁlters . The liposome solution was then delivered to anesthetized ( ketamine 90 mg / kg ip ) animals by aerosol ( 19 ) . Fluorescent liposomes were prepared separately by adding the dye DiO to the lipid mixture ( 35 ) . Compared with direct intratracheal instillation , aerosol delivery is associated with more macrophage depletion and fewer air space neutrophils ( 19 ) . VILI model . A previously described VILI model ( 17 ) with slight modiﬁcation was used . Brieﬂy , rats were anesthetized with 4 % isoﬂu - rane and 50 mg / kg ip pentobarbital . A tracheostomy tube ( 15 - gauge luer adapter ) was placed , and mechanical ventilation was started with a tidal volume of 6 ml / kg , a positive end - expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) of 5 cmH 2 O , a respiratory rate of 60 breaths / min , and 21 % oxygen .

Respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain normal arterial pH . Follow - ing a 10 - min stable baseline period , tidal volume was increased to 30 ml / kg without PEEP . Tidal volume was decreased if necessary to limit airway pressure to 30 cmH 2 O throughout the protocol . These settings were used to approximate ventilation at total lung capacity . Respira - tory rate was decreased to 30 breaths / min , and additional dead space was added to the ventilator circuit as needed to maintain normal arterial pH . Anesthesia was maintained with isoﬂurane ( 0 . 5 – 2 % ) , and muscle relaxation was maintained with pancuronium ( 2 mg (cid:1) kg (cid:3) 1 (cid:1) h (cid:3) 1 ) . Ventilation was continued from 10 min to 4 h . Normal saline ( 1 . 5 mg (cid:1) kg (cid:3) 1 (cid:1) h (cid:3) 1 ) was administered throughout the protocol . Airway pressures , blood pressure , and heart rate were monitored continuously using a computer - integrated data collection system . Arterial blood gases were measured at 1 , 2 , and 4 h , and plasma samples were collected at the start and end of the protocol . Pulmonary edema , permeability , and bronchoalveolar lavage . Pul - monary edema was measured as the blood - free , excess lung water determined by gravimetric methods ( 16 ) . Lung endothelial and alve - olar epithelial permeability to albumin were measured by determining the extravasation of intravascular 125 I - labeled albumin into the lung as previously described ( 16 ) . Permeability is expressed as the extravas - cular plasma equivalents in microliters . BAL was performed with three aliquots of 7 ml of warmed normal saline instilled into the lungs and gently withdrawn . A differential cell count was determined on an aliquot of the total BAL ﬂuid using a hemocytometer , and cytological centrifuge preparation was stained with Wright’s stain and eosin . For BAL ﬂuid used in the nitrite assay , a single aliquot of 7 ml of warmed RPMI 1640 was instilled three times , centrifuged , and stored for later use . Experimental groups for the macrophage depletion studies . A total of 44 rats were used for these studies . There were four groups : 1 ) empty liposomes , unventilated ( n (cid:4) 8 ) ; 2 ) clodronate liposomes , unventilated ( n (cid:4) 8 ) ; 3 ) empty liposomes , ventilated ( n (cid:4) 14 ) ; and 4 ) clodronate liposomes , ventilated ( n (cid:4) 14 ) . BAL was done at the end of the experimental protocol on 4 subjects from each group . These four animals were not used for the pulmonary edema or permeability measurements . Measurement of plasma CXC ligand 1 . Plasma samples were collected from rats at the beginning of the protocol and at the end of the high tidal volume ventilation period . Levels of the chemokine CXC ligand 1 ( CXCL1 ) were measured using a rat - speciﬁc ELISA with a detection threshold of 40 pg / ml ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) . Like human IL - 8 , CXCL1 is a ligand for CXC receptors 1 and 2 . CXCL1 is also known as GRO , KC , MIP - 2 , and CINC - 1 in rodents . All samples were tested in duplicate . CXCL1 levels were measured on four matched pairs of empty liposome - treated and clodronate lipo - some - treated rats ( i . e . , 4 subjects in each group of 14 subjects ) . Macrophage nitrite production assay . Nitrite production was mea - sured as a surrogate of macrophage nitric oxide production , a recog - nized functional marker of macrophage activation ( 25 ) . Primary alveolar macrophages from 10 rats were plated at 75 , 000 cells / well in 96 - well culture plates . Nitrite production was then measured 18 h after adding either BAL ﬂuid from rats or after adding supernatants from cultured alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages exposed to me - chanical strain in vitro . Nitrite concentration was determined with a colorimetric nitric oxide assay kit ( Caymen , San Diego , CA ) as previously described ( 17 ) . For the BAL ﬂuid studies , 200 (cid:5) l of cell - free BAL ﬂuid from unventilated rats ( n (cid:4) 4 ) or from rats exposed to mechanical ventilation for 10 ( n (cid:4) 3 ) or 20 min ( n (cid:4) 4 ) were added to the primary macrophages in 96 - well plates , and cells were incubated for 18 h at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . There was a minimum of six wells of macrophages per experimental condition , and the exper - iment was repeated ﬁve times . To normalize nitrite production to cell number , cell density was determined as follows . Cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed in 70 % ethanol for 10 min . Cells were then stained with 1 % crystal violet ( 15 min ) and thoroughly rinsed with tap water . The stain was extracted from cells by adding 50 (cid:5) l of 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 . Relative quantiﬁcation was done by reading absorbance at 570 nm on plate reader . Total nitrite is reported as the increase in nitrite per 5 (cid:6) 10 4 cells over the initial level in the BAL ﬂuid ( 30 ) . For the in vitro mechanical strain studies , alveolar epithelial type II cells were isolated from rat lungs ( n (cid:4) 10 ) as previously described ( 13 ) . Epithelial cells were plated at 3 (cid:6) 10 6 on 35 - mm ﬂexible membranes coated with ﬁbronectin ( Bioﬂex , Hillsborough , NC ) and recoated with ﬁbronectin ( 100 (cid:5) g / ml , Calbiochem no . 341631 ; San Diego , CA ) . On day 5 , epithelial monolayer conﬂuence was conﬁrmed , and media was changed to serum - free DME - H21 , and primary rat alveolar macro - phages ( 3 (cid:6) 10 5 ) were added to some epithelial monolayers . Macro - phages were allowed to settle to the epithelial monolayer for 1 h . In separate studies , primary alveolar macrophages ( 3 (cid:6) 10 5 ) were plated on ﬁbronectin - coated membranes and allowed to adhere for 1 h . Cells were exposed to mechanical strain ( 30 % membrane surface area change at 0 . 5 Hz ) for 30 min ( Flexcell 4000T ; Hillsborough , NC ) . Media was collected , centrifuged , and then added to naı¨ve primary alveolar macrophages on 96 - well plates for measurement of nitrite production as described above . There was a minimum of three wells of cells per experimental condition , and the experiment was repeated four times . Statistics . Comparisons between two groups were made using an unpaired , two - tailed t - test for normally distributed data and the Mann - Whitney test for nonparametric data . Comparisons among three or more groups were made using one - way analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc test for multiple comparisons . P values less than 0 . 05 were considered signiﬁcant . Data are expressed as means (cid:7) SD unless otherwise noted . RESULTS High tidal volume ventilation rapidly decreases BAL mac - rophage counts . BAL macrophage counts from rats ventilated with high tidal volume and without PEEP decreased with increasing duration of mechanical ventilation ( Fig . 1 ) . Macro - Fig . 1 .

At baseline the total BAL cell count was 313 (cid:7) 50 (cid:6) 10 3 cells / ml , of which 291 (cid:7) 44 (cid:6) 10 3 were macrophages , 7 (cid:7) 9 (cid:6) 10 3 were neutrophils , and 15 (cid:7) 4 (cid:6) 10 3 were lymphocytes . After 30 min of ventilation , the total BAL cell count decreased to 190 (cid:7) 32 (cid:6) 10 3 cells / ml with 169 (cid:7) 25 (cid:6) 10 3 macrophages , 9 (cid:7) 5 (cid:6) 10 3 neutrophils , and 12 (cid:7) 4 (cid:6) 10 3 lymphocytes . Only the change in macrophages was statistically signiﬁcant at the 30 - min time point ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) . Macrophage depletion . Rats were given increasing doses ( 0 – 20 mg / ml ) of clodronate liposomes by aerosol . Maximal macrophage depletion was observed with a clodronate concen - tration of 20 mg / ml ( Fig . 2 A ) . The nadir of BAL macrophage counts was 3 – 4 days after administration ( Fig . 2 B ) . Macro - phage uptake of liposomes occurred early and was conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescently labeled liposomes . Two hours after liposomes were given , (cid:8) 70 % of alveolar macrophages recovered in lavage ﬂuid contained liposomes ( not shown ) . Macrophage depletion preserves respiratory system elas - tance and oxygenation . During baseline ventilation with low tidal volume and a PEEP level of 5 cmH 2 O , elastance was comparable between animals treated with empty liposomes and clodronate containing liposomes ( Fig . 3 A ) . Upon increasing Fig . 2 . Clodronate liposomes depleted alveolar macrophages . A : dose response of alveolar macrophage depletion 4 days after clodronate was given .

One hour later , elastance was signiﬁcantly lower in the clodronate - treated group ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) . This effect persisted for at least 4 h . Arterial oxygenation was comparable between the two groups for the ﬁrst 2 h of the protocol , but by 4 h , Pa O 2 was signiﬁcantly higher in the clodronate - treated group ( Fig . 3 B ) . There were no signiﬁcant differences in arterial P CO 2 , tidal volume , mean arterial blood pressure , or heart rate at any time in the protocol . Effect of macrophage depletion on pulmonary edema and protein permeability . Macrophage depletion with liposomal clodronate signiﬁcantly decreased pulmonary edema in this model of VILI . Excess lung water in the vehicle - treated ani - mals was signiﬁcantly higher than in clodronate - treated ani - mals ( Fig . 4 A ) . Although excess lung water in the ventilated group that received clodronate was signiﬁcantly higher than in unventilated controls , the increase was less than 50 % of that in the empty liposome - treated , ventilated group . There was no difference in excess lung water in unventilated rats given either empty liposomes or clodronate liposomes ( not shown ) . Alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial permeability to labeled albumin measured as the 125 I - albumin activity in the extravascular space of the lung was signiﬁcantly increased in both groups by high tidal volume ventilation . However , per - meability was signiﬁcantly lower in rats given clodronate liposomes compared with controls ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . There was no difference in permeability in unventilated rats given either empty liposomes or clodronate liposomes ( not shown ) . Macrophage depletion decreases chemokine levels and air space neutrophils . Plasma levels of the neutrophil chemokine CXCL1 were signiﬁcantly higher in the vehicle - treated rats than in the clodronate - treated rats after high tidal volume ventilation ( Fig . 5 A ) . BAL neutrophil counts afte r 4 h of ventilation were signiﬁcantly higher in rats receiving empty liposomes ( Fig . 5 B ) . Fig . 4 . Effect of alveolar macrophages on alveolar barrier dysfunction in ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) . A : pulmonary edema measured as excess lung water ( (cid:5) l ) increased with HV T ventilation ( * P (cid:1) 0 . 05 compared with no ventilation ) . Macrophage depletion with clodronate resulted in signiﬁcantly less pulmonary edema compared with rats treated with empty liposomes ( vehicle ; † P (cid:1) 0 . 05 compared with the ventilated , clodronate group ) .

Excess lung water and permeability were not different in unventilated rats given either empty liposomes or clodronate liposomes . Data from these two groups are combined here ( No Ventilation ) .

Nitrite production in macrophages incubated with BAL ﬂuid from ventilated rats was signiﬁcantly higher than in macrophages incubated with BAL from unventilated animals ( Fig . 6 A ) . Nitrite levels from macrophages incubated with BAL from unventilated rats were not signiﬁcantly different from levels in macrophages incu - bated with media alone ( not shown ) . Cell - free media from cultured alveolar epithelial cells exposed to cyclic mechanical strain for 30 min did not signiﬁcantly increase nitrite produc - tion in naı¨ve alveolar macrophages compared with media from unstrained alveolar epithelial cells ( Fig . 6 B ) . Similarly , media from cultured primary alveolar macrophages exposed to me - chanical strain did not increase nitrite production in naı¨ve macrophages . However , media from alveolar epithelial cell and macrophage cocultures exposed to mechanical strain for 30 min signiﬁcantly increased nitrite production in naı¨ve mac - rophages compared with media from unstrained cocultures ( Fig . 6 B ) . DISCUSSION High tidal volume ventilation induces alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury , increases barrier permeability , and decreases alveolar epithelial ﬂuid clearance from the air spaces ( 14 , 17 , 18 , 23 , 39 ) . Previous animal studies have shown that tidal volume reduction preserves epithelial and endothelial permeability and decreases pulmonary edema ( 14 ) . In patients with acute lung injury and ARDS , tidal volume reduction reduces mortality ( 2 ) . The precise mechanisms by which me - chanical forces are translated into more severe lung injury are not fully understood . In many experimental and clinical stud - ies , low tidal volume ventilation with PEEP results in signiﬁ - cantly lower plasma and air space levels of inﬂammatory mediators ( 9 , 10 , 15 , 28 , 33 , 34 ) . Accordingly , it has been postulated that pathological mechanical forces are converted into proinﬂammatory signals early in the development of VILI ( 12 ) . Although many resident lung cells can produce inﬂam - matory mediators , alveolar macrophages have a large capacity for cytokine and chemokine production , as well as nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species elaboration . Alveolar macro - phages have been shown previously to be important in the pathogenesis of alveolar barrier dysfunction in Pseudomonas pneumonia ( 19 , 22 , 37 ) , endotoxin ( 6 , 8 ) , and ische - mia - reperfusion lung injury ( 11 , 26 , 27 ) models . The role of alveolar macrophages in the initial pathogenesis of VILI has not been fully explored ; however , previous reports have shown that injurious mechanical ventilation results in decreased alve - olar macrophage counts in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) ﬂuid ( 40 ) . We reasoned that alveolar macrophage activation in response to high tidal volume ventilation was an early event in the initiation of ventilator - attributable lung injury . Initial studies conﬁrmed that BAL macrophage counts pre - cipitously dropped with the initiation of high tidal volume , zero PEEP ventilation . Ventilation for 20 min decreased macro - phage counts 45 % ( Fig . 1 ) . To determine the contribution of alveolar macrophages to the increase in alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial permeability characteristic of VILI , alveolar macrophages were depleted using a previously reported lipo - somal clodronate technique ( 19 ) . Although macrophage deple - tion was not complete ( 82 % ; Fig . 2 ) , depletion was sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly decrease lung injury severity in this model . Mac - rophage depletion resulted in signiﬁcantly lower respiratory system elastance ( Fig . 3 A ) and preserved arterial oxygenation ( Fig . 3 B ) . It is notable that when ventilator settings were changed from a tidal volume of 6 ml / kg and a PEEP level of 5 Fig . 6 . Macrophage activation by mechanical ventilation and in vitro mechan - ical strain . A : BAL ﬂuid from rats ventilated with high volume ventilation activates naı¨ve alveolar macrophages . Macrophage activation was measured in primary alveolar macrophages as nitrite production , a marker of nitric oxide synthase activity . Naı¨ve macrophages were incubated with BAL ﬂuid from unventilated rats or from rats ventilated with HV T for 10 or 20 min . BAL ﬂuid from rats ventilated for 20 min signiﬁcantly increased nitrite production in naı¨ve primary macrophages ( * P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) . Data are expressed as means (cid:7) SE . B : mechanical strain of alveolar macrophages ( M (cid:9) ) alone and primary alve - olar epithelial cell monolayers ( AEC ) with or without alveolar macrophages ( 3 (cid:6) 10 5 ) in vitro . Media from alveolar epithelial cells cocultured with alveolar macrophages and exposed to strain in vitro for 30 min signiﬁcantly increased nitrite production in naı¨ve macrophages compared with media from stretched cultures of either cell type alone ( black bars ; * P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) . Nitrite production was not different in naı¨ve primary macrophages cultured with media from unstrained alveolar macrophages alone or alveolar epithelial cells with or without alveolar macrophages ( white bars ) . Data are expressed as means (cid:7) SE .

However , in the clodronate - treated rats , elastance continued to decrease for up to 1 h while elastance remained higher in the vehicle - treated controls . The initial decrease in elastance in both groups was likely the result of the change in ventilator settings . The subsequent decrease in elastance in the clodronate - treated group may have been due to changes in lung recruitment and surfactant secretion that were counterbalanced in the vehicle - treated rats by increased pulmonary edema . It is likely that the ﬁnal differences in elastance and oxygenation are partly ex - plained by differences in pulmonary edema severity between the groups ( Fig . 4 A ) . Furthermore , alveolar barrier permeabil - ity was signiﬁcantly lower in macrophage - depleted rats follow - ing high tidal volume ventilation . These data support the hypothesis that alveolar barrier dysfunction occurs rapidly in VILI , and alveolar macrophages are important in the initial pathogenesis of VILI . The data also show that alveolar mac - rophages are not solely responsible for the increase in perme - ability in the model as macrophage depletion decreased , but did not completely prevent lung injury . For example , others have demonstrated that high volume ventilation results in endothelial cell activation , P - selectin expression , and lung neutrophil recruitment ( 41 ) . Previous studies have shown that VILI is in part dependent on the recruitment of neutrophils into the lung ( 3 ) . One study found that blocking CXCL1 and CXCL2 / 3 signaling signiﬁ - cantly decreased air space neutrophil counts and lung injury severity in experimental VILI ( 3 ) . Therefore , one mechanism by which macrophages could initiate VILI is via the release of neutrophil chemokines and subsequent neutrophil recruitment into the lung . In the present study , circulating levels of the neutrophil chemokine CXCL1 and BAL neutrophil counts were signiﬁcantly lower in macrophage - depleted rats ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Part of the protective effect of macrophage depletion could be attributable to decreased lung neutrophil recruitment . Due to the rapidity of the change in macrophage counts with high volume , zero PEEP ventilation , we suspected that in - creased macrophage activation and adhesion , rather than cell death or emigration , was most likely . Although macrophage adhesion was not directly measured , increased adhesion is indicative of activation . In addition , previous studies have reported that high volume ventilation induced increased intra - cellular expression of GADD45 ( 1 ) and membrane expression of CD14 ( 24 ) in alveolar macrophages ( markers of activation ) and that LPS - induced TNF - (cid:10) production was signiﬁcantly higher in macrophages isolated from rabbits ventilated with high volumes for 6 h ( 24 ) . Macrophage activation during high tidal volume ventilation could be the result of direct mechan - ical sensing by alveolar macrophages . For example , Pugin and colleagues ( 32 ) have previously shown that alveolar macro - phages respond to mechanical stress in vitro by increasing IL - 8 and IL - 6 production . Alternatively , macrophage activation could be initiated by mediators released from alveolar epithe - lial cells or other resident lung cells in response to mechanical stress ; however , this hypothesis has not been thoroughly in - vestigated . We postulated that BAL ﬂuid from rats ventilated with high tidal volume would induce nitric oxide synthase activity and nitrite production in primary alveolar macrophages in vitro . When macrophages were incubated with BAL ﬂuid from rats exposed to 20 min of high volume ventilation , nitrite production was signiﬁcantly increased compared with BAL ﬂuid from unventilated rats ( Fig . 6 A ) . These data indicated that soluble mediators in the BAL ﬂuid accounted for at least part of the observed increase in macrophage activation . To deter - mine if alveolar epithelial cells were a source of soluble mediators responsible for macrophage activation , we cultured alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages separately and in coculture and exposed the cells to mechanical strain . Media from stretched or unstretched alveolar epithelial cells or alveolar macrophages alone did not increase nitrite production in naı¨ve primary alveolar macrophages ( Fig . 6 B ) . However , media from epithelial monolayers cultured with alveolar mac - rophages during a 30 - min period of stretch increased macro - phage nitrite production by 39 % ( P (cid:1) 0 . 05 ) in the subsequent macrophage nitrite assay ( Fig . 6 B ) . Taken together , these data provide evidence that alveolar macrophage activation is up - regulated early in VILI and that soluble mediators contribute to additional macrophage activation in VILI . Although either epithelial cells or macrophages could be potential sources of these mediators , the data suggest that an interaction between the cell types is required for mediator release . These data are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that alveolar macrophages detect and respond to mechanical strain ; however , in the culture conditions studied , mechanical strain alone was not sufﬁcient to induce the release of mediators capable of induc - ing nitrite production in naı¨ve macrophages . Of course , me - chanical forces may affect alveolar epithelial cell membranes directly and inﬂuence cytoskeletal organization ( 4 , 18 , 39 ) ; however , data from the present study support an important role for macrophage - epithelial cell interaction in the loss of epithe - lial barrier function in this model . Although clodronate treatment is a widely used tool for alveolar macrophage depletion , it is possible that clodronate had other effects on resident lung cells as well . These data must be interpreted in this context . For example , in one study , up to 30 % of alveolar epithelial cells contained liposomes following intratracheal instillation ( 31 ) . The precise effects of clodronate liposomes on epithelial function are not clear , but , consistent with previous reports ( 19 , 22 ) , we did not observe a signiﬁcant difference in permeability in unventilated rats treated with clodronate liposomes or empty liposomes . It has also been reported that clodronate liposomes inhibit cytokine production in a macrophage - like cell line ( 29 ) ; therefore , decreased cyto - kine production by macrophages remaining in the lung is an additional potential mechanism for the observed protective effect in the present study . It is noteworthy that the absence of alveolar macrophage function has been shown to result in more severe lung injury in some models , as macrophage phagocy - tosis of neutrophils and other apoptotic cells is an important step in the regulation of the inﬂammatory response ( 20 – 22 , 36 ) . Therefore , it is uncertain if sustained macrophage inacti - vation would have a net beneﬁcial effect in clinical ventilator - associated lung injury . In summary , we found that depletion of alveolar macro - phages in vivo decreased lung endothelial and alveolar epithe - lial permeability , resulting in lower plasma levels of CXCL1 and lower neutrophil counts in the BAL ﬂuid . These data suggest that alveolar macrophages are a key contributor to the early proinﬂammatory milieu and increased permeability pul - monary edema characteristic of VILI . In addition , soluble mediators released into the air spaces during high volume L1196 ALVEOLAR MACROPHAGES IN VILI AJP - Lung Cell Mol Physiol • VOL 291 • DECEMBER 2006 • www . ajplung . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 1 on M a y 30 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p l ung . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ventilation activated naı¨ve macrophages , as did media from stretched alveolar epithelial cell and macrophage cocultures . These data support the hypothesis that soluble factors released into the air spaces as a result of the interaction between alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages trigger ad - ditional macrophage activation in VILI . However , the potential role of the alveolar epithelium or other resident lung cells in initiating macrophage activation has not been entirely eluci - dated . This study provides important insights into the patho - genesis of ventilator - attributable lung injury . First , VILI is initiated in part by alveolar macrophages . These data also suggest that one mechanism by which alveolar macrophages contribute to VILI is through recruitment of neutrophils into the air spaces . Second , the onset of ventilator - attributable lung injury is rapid and begins within minutes of starting mechan - ical ventilation . Accordingly , in the clinical setting , protective ventilation strategies may need to be initiated as early as possible in the course of mechanical ventilation .
