Therapeutic treatment of P . aeruginosa infections is still very difﬁcult because the bacteria exhibit high intrinsic resistance against a variety of different antibiotics and , in addition , form stable bioﬁlms , e . g . in the human lung . Several virulence factors are produced by P . aeruginosa , among them the two lectins LecA and LecB , which exert different cytotoxic effects on respiratory epithelial cells and presumably facilitate bacterial adhesion to the airway mucosa . Here , the physiology has been studied of the lectin LecB , which binds speciﬁcally to L - fucose . A LecB - deﬁcient P . aeruginosa mutant was shown to be impaired in bioﬁlm formation when compared with the wild - type strain , suggesting an important role for LecB in this process . This result prompted an investigation of the subcellular localization of LecB by cell fractionation and subsequent immunoblotting . The results show that LecB is abundantly present in the bacterial outer - membrane fraction . It is further demonstrated that LecB could be released speciﬁcally by treatment of the outer - membrane fraction with p - nitrophenyl a - L - fucose , whereas treatment with D - galactose had no effect . In contrast , a LecB protein carrying the mutation D104A , which results in a defective sugar - binding site , was no longer detectable in the membrane fraction , suggesting that LecB binds to speciﬁc carbohydrate ligands located at the bacterial cell surface . Staining of bioﬁlm cells using ﬂuorescently labelled LecB conﬁrmed the presence of these ligands . INTRODUCTION Lectins represent a speciﬁc class of carbohydrate - binding proteins different from enzymes or antibodies ( Barondes et al . , 1988 ) . They are found in a wide range of organisms including viruses , bacteria , plants and animals , and are believed to play an important role in cell – cell interactions ( Gabius et al . , 2002 ) . Speciﬁc recognition of or attachment to target cells was demonstrated for the mannose - speciﬁc lectin FimH from Escherichia coli , which mediates adhesion between the bacterium and the urothelium ( Beachey , 1981 ) . Furthermore , lectins may have signiﬁcant biotechnological and medical potential , as exempliﬁed by the galactoside - speciﬁc mistletoe lectin , which is used on a large scale to support anti - cancer therapy ( Beuth et al . , 1995 ) . Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an important opportunistic pathogen associated with chronic airway infections , synthe - sizes two lectins , LecA and LecB ( formerly respectively named PA - IL and PA - IIL ) ( Gilboa - Garber , 1982 ) . Strains of P . aeruginosa that produce high levels of these virulence factors exhibit an increased virulence potential ( Gilboa - Garber & Garber , 1992 ) . The lectins play a prominent role in human infections , as it was demonstrated that a P .

The sugar solutions presumably prevented lectin - mediated bacterial adhesion to the corresponding host tissue . The expression of lectin genes in P . aeruginosa is coordinately regulated with certain other virulence factors and controlled via quorum sensing and by the alternative sigma factor RpoS ( Winzer et al . , 2000 ) . The galactophilic LecA has been characterized in great detail over the last 30 years . It consists of four 12 ? 75 kDa subunits ( Gilboa - Garber , 1972 ; Avichezer et al . , 1992 ) and has been shown to cause cytotoxic effects on respiratory epithelial cells by decreasing their growth rate , thus contributing to respiratory epithelial injury during P . aeruginosa infection ( Bajolet - Laudinat et al . , 1994 ) . In addition , it was demon - strated that LecA induces a permeability defect in the intestinal epithelium , resulting in increased absorption of exotoxin A , an important extracellular virulence factor of P . aeruginosa ( Laughlin et al . , 2000 ) . LecB consists of four 11 ? 73 kDa subunits , each exhibiting a high speciﬁcity for L - fucose and its derivatives ( Gilboa - Garber et al . , 2000 ; Garber et al . , 1987 ) and also for D - mannose , with lower afﬁnity . Its crystal structure was determined recently ( Mitchell et al . , 2002 , 2005 ; Loris et al . , 2003 ) . In cystic ﬁbrosis ( CF ) , increased terminal fucosyla - tion of airway epithelial glycoproteins is found , as well as a higher percentage of sialylated and sulfated oligosac - charides in Lewis A oligosaccharide side chains , which presumably represent preferential ligands for LecB ( Mitchell et al . , 2002 ) , which thereby contributes signiﬁcantly to chronic respiratory Pseudomonas infections ( Scanlin & Glick , 2001 ) . In addition , LecB decreases in vitro the ciliary beat frequency of the airway epithelium , hence inhibiting an important defence mechanism of the human lung ( Adam et al . , 1997a , b ) . Both P . aeruginosa lectins were shown to be located mainly in the cytoplasm of planktonic cells ( Glick & Garber , 1983 ) . These ﬁndings make it difﬁcult to explain the lectin - mediated cytotoxic and adhesive properties . Recently , it was suggested that LecB is exposed on the surface of sessile Pseudomonas cells , since the addition of L - fucose - branched chitosan leads to speciﬁc cell aggregation ( Morimoto et al . , 2001 ) . Bioﬁlms are accumulations of micro - organisms at solid – liquid or solid – air interfaces , where the cells are embedded in a matrix of self - produced extracellular polymeric sub - stances , with polysaccharides and proteins as characteristic components ( Wingender et al . , 1999 ) . Exopolysaccharides are considered as key components which determine the structural and functional integrity of microbial bioﬁlm aggregates by the formation of a three - dimensional , gel - like , highly hydrated and locally charged bioﬁlm matrix , in which the micro - organisms are immobilized . Also , binding of bioﬁlm cells ( cohesion ) and anchoring of bioﬁlms to the substratum ( adhesion ) are mediated by exopolysaccharides . Consequently , extracellular proteins with lectin - like func - tions may contribute to polymer network formation in bioﬁlms ( Higgins & Novak , 1997 ; Imberty et al . , 2004 ) . The formation of P . aeruginosa bioﬁlms on tissues of infected patients as well as on medical devices was recently shown to be responsible for the inherent resistance of the bacterium to certain antibiotics and other various antimicrobial agents ( Costerton et al . , 1999 ; Stewart & Costerton , 2001 ) . Since cell - surface - exposed oligosaccharide receptors on eukaryo - tic host cells are ubiquitous in nature , it is reasonable to assume that both lectins are involved in the attachment of cells to biotic surfaces . Moreover , lectin - mediated cell – cell interactions within a given bacterial population may be involved in the development and maintenance of bioﬁlms , thereby determining the ability of P . aeruginosa to colonize biotic and abiotic surfaces and to persist in the bioﬁlm mode of growth ( Parsek & Greenberg , 2000 ; Imberty et al . , 2004 ) . In this paper , we report on the role of LecB in bioﬁlm formation and its cellular localization in planktonic and sessile P . aeruginosa cells . Confocal laser scanning micro - scopy ( CLSM ) was used to monitor bioﬁlm formation of a LecB - deﬁcient mutant strain and the localization of LecB in sessile cells was investigated by fractionation of bac - terial cells grown as a bioﬁlm and determination of LecB localization in the different cellular compartments using a LecB - speciﬁc polyclonal antiserum . The interaction of LecB with the outer membrane of P . aeruginosa was investigated by constructing a LecB - mutant defective in sugar binding as suggested by analysis of the LecB crystal structure we have recently solved ( Loris et al . , 2003 ) . The presence of putative ligands on the surface of bioﬁlm cells was visualized by cell staining using ﬂuorescently labelled LecB . METHODS Bacterial strains and plasmids . The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . E . coli DH5 a was used for cloning experiments and E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) as a heterologous expression host for plasmid - encoded LecB . E . coli S17 - 1 was used for conjugal transfer . Media and growth conditions . Precultures for all experiments were prepared overnight in 5 ml Luria – Bertani ( LB ) medium in glass tubes at 37 u C . Plasmid - carrying E . coli cells were selected with 50 m g chloramphenicol ml 2 1 , 100 m g ampicillin ml 2 1 , 10 m g tetra - cycline ml 2 1 and / or 20 m g gentamicin ml 2 1 . In the case of plasmid - or cassette - carrying P . aeruginosa strains , 300 m g chloramphenicol ml 2 1 , 100 m g tetracycline ml 2 1 and / or 50 m g gentamicin ml 2 1 were added . Cultivation of bioﬁlms . Bioﬁlms were grown under static condi - tion on glass slides . Fifteen millilitres nutrient broth ( NB ) [ 8 g nutrient broth ( Oxoid ) ; 4 g NaCl l 2 1 ] in a sterile Petri dish was inoculated to an OD 580 of 0 ? 05 from overnight cultures grown in NB , glass slides were submerged and the cultures were incubated for 48 or 72 h at 30 u C . Prior to CLSM analysis , glass slides were rinsed with 2 ml 0 ? 14 M NaCl to remove unadsorbed cells . For staining of P . aeruginosa PAO1 cells with ﬂuorescently labelled LecB , bioﬁlms were grown on membrane ﬁlters ( Strathmann et al . , 2002 ) . Bacteria 1314 Microbiology 151 D .

Single colonies were suspended in 0 ? 14 M NaCl to a concentration of approximately 10 6 cells ml 2 1 . Ten millilitres of this suspension was vacuum - ﬁltered onto 25 mm black polycarbonate ﬁlters ( 0 ? 4 m m pore size ; Millipore ) , which were then placed on the surface of PIA plates and cultivated for 24 h at 37 u C . Lectin staining of bioﬁlm cells . The method was modiﬁed from Strathmann et al . ( 2002 ) . Fifty microlitres of a solution containing 10 m g LecB YFP ml 2 1 and 75 m M of the red ﬂuorescent nucleic - acid - binding dye SYTO 62 ( Molecular Probes ) in 10 mM phosphate buffer , pH 7 ? 5 , was carefully applied directly on top of bioﬁlms grown on membrane ﬁlters ( Strathmann et al . , 2002 ) . After incuba - tion for 1 h in the dark at room temperature , excess staining solu - tion was removed by three rinses with 1 ml phosphate buffer . Competitive inhibition of lectin binding was studied by preincuba - tion of the LecB YFP staining solution with 100 mg L - fucose ml 2 1 for 15 min at room temperature . CLSM . Bioﬁlms were always grown in two independent experiments and at least three different sites were analysed by CLSM . Bioﬁlms on glass slides were stained non - destructively with the green ﬂuorescent nucleic - acid - binding dye SYTO 9 ( Molecular Probes ) as described by the manufacturer . Images of bioﬁlms were obtained with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( LSM 510 ; Zeiss ) using an LD Achroplan 40 6 / 0 ? 60 NA ( corr . ) lens . Three - dimensional image stacks were recorded at 488 nm excitation wavelength using an LP 505 nm long - pass detection ﬁlter . Confocal images were recorded from at least three ﬁelds of view for each sample . The extent of the analysis was done in order to fulﬁl the minimum sampling area requirement as suggested by Korber et al . ( 1993 ) for bioﬁlm sam - ples . The pinhole size was adjusted to equal 1 ? 0 Airy unit . Image recording of CLSM optical thin sections was performed with the Zeiss LSM software ( version 2 . 8 ) . Bioﬁlm mean thickness , surface coverage , roughness and biomass were determined by digital image processing using COMSTAT image - analysis software ( Heydorn et al . , 2000 ) . Images of the bioﬁlms on polycarbonate ﬁlters were recorded by CLSM as described above at 488 nm excitation wavelength using a BP 505 – 550 nm band - pass detection ﬁlter and at 633 nm excita - tion wavelength using an LP 650 nm long - pass detection ﬁlter for LecB YFP and SYTO 62 , respectively . DNA manipulation and PCR . Recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al . ( 1989 ) . DNA fragments were ampliﬁed by standard PCR methods . DNA - modifying enzymes ( Fermentas ) were used according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . Plasmid DNA was prepared as described by Birnboim & Doly ( 1979 ) and by using the HiSpeed plasmid puriﬁcation midi kit or , for genomic DNA from P . aeruginosa , the DNeasy Tissue kit ( Qiagen ) .

The resulting fragments were cloned into the Xba I / Bam HI and Bam HI / Hin dIII sites of plasmid pBCSK , giving pL2US and pL2DS , respectively . An V - gentamicin cassette was isolated as a 1 ? 6 kb fragment by digesting the plasmid pBSL141 with Mlu I and subsequently cloned into the Mlu I site of pL2US resulting in pL2UG . This plasmid was digested with Xba I / Bam HI and the result - ing 2 ? 1 kb fragment was cloned into pL2DS to give pUGD2 . After restriction of this plasmid with Xba I / Hin dIII and blunt - ending with T4 polymerase , the resulting 2 ? 6 kb fragment carried the V - gentamicin cassette located between the upstream and downstream sequences of lecB . This fragment was ligated into Sca I - digested pSUP202 , resulting in the suicide vector pSUGD2 . Replacement of the chromosomal copy of lecB by the V - gentamicin cassette was achieved after conjugation and resulted in P . aeruginosa lecB - mutant strain PATI2 , as conﬁrmed by PCR and Western - blotting . Finally , the V - gentamicin cassette was removed by digestion of plasmid pSUGD2 with Mlu I and religation resulting in pSUD2 , which was subsequently transferred by conjugation into the D lecB : : Gm r strain of P . aeruginosa . Deletion of the V - gentamicin cassette was con - ﬁrmed by PCR and Western blotting and the resulting mutant strain was named P . aeruginosa PATI4 . Cloning of lecB for localization studies . The cellular distribu - tion of LecB was studied using the lecB - negative strains P . aeruginosa PATI2 and PATI4 , which were transformed with plasmid pBBC2 containing the lecB gene under transcriptional control of the lac pro - moter . This plasmid was constructed by digestion of plasmid pEC2 with Sac I / Xba I . The resulting fragment consisting of the lecB gene and the ribosome - binding site of pET22b was cloned into the Sac I / Xba I sites of pBBR1MCS giving pBBC2 , which was transferred into P . aeruginosa PATI4 by conjugation . Cloning of a yfp : : lecB fusion . A 765 bp DNA fragment carrying the gene encoding YFP ( a yellowish - green variant of the green ﬂuor - escent protein from Aequorea victoria ) excluding the stop codon was ampliﬁed by PCR using plasmid pFF19 - EYFP as the template with oligonucleotide primers YFPFusUp ( 5 9 - GCTCTAGAAAGAA - GGAGATATATATATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCT ) and YFPFusDWN ( 5 9 - GGAATTCCATATGCCATGGCTTGTACAGCT - CGTCCATGC ) , introducing an Xba I , Nde I or Nco I site . Primer YFPFusUp contained the sequence encoding the ribosome - binding site ( underlined ) . This fragment was digested with Xba I / NdeI and cloned into the lecB - carrying plasmid pEC2 , resulting in plasmid pEYL2 , which was transformed into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) . The fusion protein expressed from this plasmid is referred to as LecB YFP . Overexpression and puriﬁcation of LecB YFP . The overexpres - sion and puriﬁcation of LecB YFP was performed as described previously for the native LecB protein ( Loris et al . , 2003 ) . Mutation of the sugar - binding site in LecB . The lecB gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers LIINdeI ( 5 9 - AAAACATATGGCAACACAAGGAGTGTTCA ) and LIIXch ( 5 9 - AAAAGGATCCCTAGCCGAGCGGCCAGTTGATCACGGCGGC - GGCGGCGTTGTAGTCGTTGTC ) . The ampliﬁed DNA fragment was cloned into the Nde I / Bam HI sites of pET22b , excised by diges - tion with Sac I / Xba I and ligated into pBBR1MCS which had been digested with the same enzymes . The resulting plasmid pBBXCH2 was introduced into P . aeruginosa PATI4 by conjugation . Fractionation of P . aeruginosa cells . The method was modiﬁed from Witholt et al . ( 1976 ) . P . aeruginosa PATI2 and PATI4 , contain - ing pBBC2 or pBBXCH2 , was grown in NB medium or on NB agar plates at 37 u C for 48 h . Bacterial cells ( 1 ? 2 mg dry weight ) were washed off with 1 ml 0 ? 14 M NaCl and then centrifuged at 3000 g ; the supernatant was sterile - ﬁltered and used to determine the con - tent of LecB in the extracellular space . The cell pellet was carefully suspended in 240 m l 100 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 , containing 20 % ( w / v ) sucrose . After addition of 240 m l of the same buffer containing 5 mM EDTA and 20 m g lysozyme , the sample was incubated for 30 min at room temperature , spheroplasts were collected by centri - fugation at 10000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was used as the periplasmic fraction . Spheroplasts were disrupted by sonication ( Soniﬁer W250 ; Branson ) in 240 m l 100 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 . After centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 g to remove undisrupted cells and cell debris , the total membrane fraction was collected by centrifuga - tion for 45 min at 13000 g and the supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction . An amount equivalent to an OD at 580 nm of 0 ? 5 of each fraction was used for Western blotting . Isolation of inner and outer membranes . This was done as described by Wilhelm et al . ( 1999 ) . P . aeruginosa PATI2 cells con - taining plasmid pBBC2 ( 50 mg dry weight ) were isolated after growth for 48 h from NB agar plates by resuspension in 20 ml 0 ? 14 M NaCl . Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 u C with 1 mg lysozyme , disrupted using a glass bead mill followed by three freez - ing and thawing cycles and intact cells were separated from the cell extract by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min . The supernatant was centrifuged at 13000 g for 1 h . The pellet , consisting of the total membrane fraction , was resuspended in 1 ml 10 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 , containing 1 mM EDTA and 30 % ( w / v ) sucrose , and layered on the top of a discontinuous gradient prepared by combining sucrose solutions of the following concentrations : 0 ? 5 ml 60 % , 2 ? 1 ml 55 % , 2 ? 1 ml 50 % , 2 ? 1 ml 45 % , 2 ? 1 ml 40 % and 2 ? 1 ml 35 % ( w / v ) sucrose in 10 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 , 1 mM EDTA . The gradient was centrifuged using an SW41 rotor in an L8 - 70 ultra - centrifuge ( Beckman ) at 36000 r . p . m . and 4 u C for 36 h , and 0 ? 5 ml fractions were subsequently removed from the centrifugation tube . Enzyme assays . These were described by Wilhelm et al . ( 1999 ) . NADH oxidase and esterase activities were determined as marker enzymes for the inner and outer membrane , respectively , by spectro - photometric determination of the absorbance decrease at 340 nm for NADH oxidase and the absorbance increase at 410 nm for ester - ase . For NADH oxidase , 900 m l reaction mixture ( 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 ? 5 , 0 ? 2 mM DTT , 0 ? 12 mM NADH ) was incubated for 5 min at 25 u C with 100 m l of each fraction . For esterase activity , 23 ? 7 mg p - nitrophenyl caproate ( p NPC ; Sigma ) was dissolved in 5 ml ethanol and added to 95 ml 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer , pH 7 , supplemented with 10 mM MgSO 4 , to yield a ﬁnal p NPC concentra - tion of 1 mM . Aliquots ( 20 m l ) of each fraction were added to 180 m l substrate solution in a microtitre plate , the samples were incubated for 10 min at 25 u C and the A 410 was recorded . The fractions with the highest NADH oxidase and esterase activities , which respectively represented the inner and outer membrane frac - tions , were pooled . For immunodetection of LecB , 100 m l of these fractions was diluted to 2 ml with 10 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 . Proteins were collected by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid ( Sivaraman et al . , 1997 ) . Washing the outer membrane with solutions of different carbohydrates . Proteins from 100 m l of the outer - membrane fraction were collected by centrifugation at 13000 g for 1 h . The pellet was suspended in 100 m l 100 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 , contain - ing 20 mM p - nitrophenyl a - L - fucose ( p NPF ; Sigma ) or 20 mM D - galactose ( Sigma ) as a negative control , and shaken gently for 1 h at 37 u C . After centrifugation of the samples , the proteins in pellets and supernatants were analysed by immunoblotting using LecB - speciﬁc antibodies . 1316 Microbiology 151 D .

Prior to electrophoresis , samples were sus - pended in SDS - PAGE sample buffer , boiled for 5 min at 95 u C and loaded onto an SDS - 16 % polyacrylamide gel followed by electro - phoretic protein transfer at 0 ? 3 A for 30 min to PVDF membranes . LecB was detected using the polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1 : 20000 in TBST ( 25 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 0 ? 2 % v / v Tween 20 ) followed by an anti - rabbit immunoglobu - lin G – horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( Bio - Rad ) and developed with the ECL kit ( Pharmacia ) . RESULTS A LecB - negative mutant is impaired in bioﬁlm formation The bioﬁlm - forming capacities of the P . aeruginosa wild - type strain PAO1 and the LecB - deﬁcient mutant PATI2 were investigated by growing static bioﬁlms in NB medium on glass slides over growth periods of 48 and 72 h at 30 and 37 u C . Regular examination of the glass slides by CLSM revealed that the LecB - mutant P . aeruginosa PATI2 was affected in bioﬁlm formation at both temperatures . The bioﬁlms of the mutant strain were found to be thinner than those formed by the wild - type ( Fig . 1 ; Table 2 ) . Further - more , the surface coverage of the mutant strain was lower than that of the wild - type . This effect was not caused by a general growth defect , as planktonic populations of the wild - type and the LecB - negative mutant exhibited the same growth rates and reached the same maximal cell densities ( data not shown ) . LecB is associated with the outer membrane The ﬁnding that the LecB - deﬁcient P . aeruginosa strain was impaired in bioﬁlm formation prompted us to determine the subcellular localization of LecB . For this , planktonic cells were compared with sessile P . aeruginosa PATI2 cells , which harboured the plasmid pBBC2 containing the wild - type lecB gene under transcriptional control of the con - stitutive lac promoter and had been grown as an unsaturated bioﬁlm on the surface of NB agar . This method has been shown to result in the formation of unsaturated bioﬁlms ( Steinberger et al . , 2002 ) of the type that is also found in the lungs of CF patients suffering from a P . aeruginosa infection ( Lyczak et al . , 2002 ) . Cellular compartments were isolated using differential cell fractionation and proteins were analysed by SDS - PAGE and subsequent Western blotting using a LecB - speciﬁc antiserum raised against puriﬁed LecB . After 48 h of growth at 37 u C , LecB was detected in the cytoplasm as well as in the total membrane fraction in both sessile and planktonic cells ( Fig . 2 ) . The precise localization of LecB was investigated by separating the inner and the outer bacterial membrane of sessile P . aeruginosa cells by discontinuous sucrose - density centrifugation . Activities of the marker enzymes NADH oxidase and esterase were determined to identify inner - and outer - membrane fractions , respectively . The fractions showing the highest enzyme activities were pooled and analysed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting , revealing that LecB was located exclusively in the bacterial outer membrane ( Fig . 3 ) . LecB binds to carbohydrate ligands in the outer membrane The localization of LecB in the outer membrane of P . aeruginosa and its high afﬁnity for L - fucose and its derivatives , like p NPF ( Garber et al . , 1987 ) , suggested that this lectin might be bound to the outer membrane via fucose - containing structures . This assumption was tested by incubating an isolated outer - membrane fraction with 20 mM of either p NPF or D - galactose , which served as a negative control because the afﬁnity of LecB for D - galactose is extremely low ( Garber et al . , 1987 ) . The outer mem - brane was isolated by centrifugation and the proteins of the membrane - containing pellet and the supernatant were subjected to SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . LecB was detected in the supernatant obtained from the p NPF - treated outer - membrane fraction , whereas it was missing in the corresponding pellet ( Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , treatment with D - galactose did not result in any detectable release of LecB from the outer membrane . These ﬁndings strongly suggest that LecB is bound to the outer membrane by interaction with fucose - containing ligands . The outer - membrane localization of LecB depends on an intact sugar - binding site LecB was located in the outer membrane at an advanced stage of bioﬁlm formation ( Fig . 3 ) . Treatment of the outer - membrane fraction with p NPF resulted in the release of LecB , suggesting that this lectin interacts with fucose - containing receptors at the cell surface ( Fig . 4 ) . Analysis of the LecB crystal structure we have recently solved ( Loris et al . , 2003 ) allowed us to identify those amino acid residues which are involved in carbohydrate binding . Among them , D104 plays a crucial role by coordinating two calcium atoms which themselves are directly involved in carbohy - drate binding . Therefore , we have constructed plasmid pBBXCH2 , which expresses a mutated LecB carrying the substitution D104A , which renders this protein unable to bind carbohydrates ( Fig . 5a ) . This plasmid was introduced into the LecB - deﬁcient P . aeruginosa strain PATI4 . After growth for 48 h on NB agar plates , cells were fractionated and analysed for the presence of mutant LecB in compari - son with the wild - type . Both strains produced LecB in the cytoplasm , but , in contrast to the wild - type lectin , the mutated LecB was not detected in the membrane fraction ( Fig . 5b ) , indicating that the sugar - binding capacity of LecB may be essential for its outer - membrane localization . LecB speciﬁcally binds to the surface of bioﬁlm cells Our results clearly indicated that LecB interacted with the outer membrane via binding to carbohydrate ligands . The presence of these ligands on the surface of living bioﬁlm cells was investigated by growing P . aeruginosa PAO1 on http : / / mic . sgmjournals . org 1317 P . aeruginosa lectin LecB Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Wed , 09 Jan 2019 04 : 35 : 51 membrane ﬁlters for 24 h at 37 u C on PIA plates . After treatment for 1 h with a staining solution containing a ﬂuorescently labelled LecB ( green ) and the DNA - binding dye SYTO 62 ( red ) , bioﬁlms were washed and analysed by CLSM . The intense ﬂuorescent signal covering the cell peri - phery shown in Fig . 6 ( a , c ) demonstrates the binding of LecB YFP to the surface of the red - stained cells . This binding was even more pronounced when the mucoid P . aeruginosa strain SG81 was used ( Fig . 6b , d ) . Preincubation of LecB YFP with L - fucose prior to cell staining inhibited this interaction of the lectin with the cell surface ( Fig . 6e , f ) . These results clearly showed that carbohydrate receptors on the surface of P . aeruginosa bioﬁlm cells were accessible to LecB . DISCUSSION P . aeruginosa is the major pathogen in the respiratory tract of patients suffering from CF . The treatment of these chronic P . aeruginosa airway infections is thwarted by its innate antibiotic resistance , which is aggravated by Table 2 .

The application of drugs that inhibit or even prevent bioﬁlm formation seems to be a promising approach ( Stewart & Costerton , 2001 ) . Therefore , the mechanisms responsible for bioﬁlm forma - tion have been the subject of numerous recent studies and several proteins involved in bioﬁlm formation and develop - ment have been identiﬁed ( O’Toole & Kolter , 1998 ; Vallet et al . , 2001 ; Klausen et al . , 2003 ) .

This ﬁnding raises the question of how an internally localized lectin can contribute to the forma - tion of a bioﬁlm . Bioﬁlm cells differ fundamentally from their planktonic counterparts in a variety of physiological aspects ( Costerton et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore , we decided to investigate the subcellular localization of LecB in planktonic and sessile cells . In contrast to previous observations ( Glick & Garber , 1983 ) , our results showed that , in both cases , LecB was present in the outer membrane of P . aeruginosa , even though the protein lacks structural characteristics of outer - membrane proteins , e . g . a terminal F residue and typical b - barrel - forming structures ( Mitchell et al . , 2002 , 2005 ; Loris et al . , 2003 ) . The binding constants of LecB for L - fucose and D - mannose were determined to be 1 ? 5 6 10 6 M 2 1 and 3 ? 1 6 10 2 M 2 1 , respectively ( Garber et al . , 1987 ) . Treatment of the outer - membrane fraction with p NPF , which has been shown to be bound by LecB with an even higher afﬁnity than L - fucose itself ( Garber et al . , 1987 ) , caused the dissociation of LecB from the outer membrane . A mutation in the sugar - binding site of LecB resulted in a mutant LecB which no longer appeared in the membrane fraction . These results indicated that LecB is associated with the bacterial cell surface via binding to carbohydrate ligands . The presence of such putative LecB receptors on the surface of P . aeruginosa cells was demonstrated by speciﬁc cell staining using YFP - labelled LecB . As expected , this process could be inhibited by preincubation of the lectin with L - fucose . The carbohydrate ligands may reside on either lipopolysacchar - ide or glycosylated cell - surface proteins , which include P . aeruginosa pili and type A ﬂagella ( Brimer & Montie , 1998 ; Castric et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , O - antigenic oligosacchar - ides of different P . aeruginosa serotypes contain the a - L - fucose derivative a - L - N - acetyl fucosamine , which is also part of the trisaccharide which decorates the pili of the clinical P . aeruginosa isolate 1244 ( DiGiandomenico et al . , 2002 ) . Additionally , it was recently demonstrated that mannose is one of the primary constituents of the extra - cellular polysaccharide of bioﬁlms formed by the typically non - mucoid strain P . aeruginosa PAO1 ( Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , several other pathogenic bacteria are known to contain glycosylated cell - surface proteins , among them the Gram - positive organisms Streptococcus sanguinis ( Erickson & Herzberg , 1993 ) and Mycobacterium tubercu - losis ( Dobos et al . , 1995 ) and the Gram - negative Neisseria meningitidis , N . gonorrhoeae , Campylobacter jejuni , E . coli and Helicobacter pylori ( Power & Jennings , 2003 ) . However , in most of these cases , the structures of the glycans are unknown , as are the physiological roles of the glycosylation of the proteins . Surface - exposed LecB may mediate the adhesion of P . aeruginosa to receptors located on cells of either the same or different species , thus enabling the colonization of host tissues or the formation of mono - or multispecies bioﬁlms . Several P . aeruginosa proteins , including pilus and ﬂagellar proteins as well as the outer - membrane protein OprF , have Fig . 6 . Selective binding of LecB to the cell surface of P . aeruginosa . Bioﬁlms were grown on membrane ﬁlters for 24 h on PIA plates . Bioﬁlms of P . aeruginosa PAO1 ( a , c ) and the mucoid isolate P . aeruginosa SG81 ( b , d ) were treated with ﬂuorescently labelled LecB YFP ( green ) , washed and counterstained with the DNA - binding dye SYTO 62 ( red ) . Inhibition of lectin binding to P . aeruginosa PAO1 ( e ) and SG81 ( f ) by L - fucose is also shown . Prior to cell staining , LecB YFP was preincubated with 100 mg L - fucose ml ” 1 for 15 min at room temperature . Bars , 5 m m . 1320 Microbiology 151 D .

In an earlier report , it was shown that biotinylated LecB speci - ﬁcally binds to the surface of human nasal polyp explants ( Adam et al . , 1997a ) . Interestingly , it was demonstrated that mucin from patients suffering from CF contains increased amounts of fucosylated glycoproteins ( Shori et al . , 2001 ; Scanlin & Glick , 2001 ) , suggesting that surface - exposed LecB may bind to these glycoproteins and promote per - sistent infections with P . aeruginosa . This hypothesis is further substantiated by the recent ﬁnding that the up - regulation of a Fuc ( a 1 - 2 ) fucosyltransferase was responsible for increased fucosylation of intestinal mucins from CF mice ( Thomsson et al . , 2002 ) . For CF , the membrane glycoproteins from respiratory epithelial cells expressing a mutated cftr gene were shown to be more fucosylated than those from cells expressing the wild - type gene ( Rhim et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , LecB in particular may facilitate the attachment of P . aeruginosa to the CF airway epithelium . The successful treatment of a patient suffering from a Pseudomonas - induced respiratory tract infection with a solution containing LecA - and LecB - speciﬁc sugars ( von Bismarck et al . , 2001 ) supports the hypothesis that LecB contributes to the development of chronic airway infec - tions via binding to fucosylated glycoproteins of the mucin and / or the respiratory epithelium . Interestingly , P . aeruginosa LecB does not contain any of the presently known secretion signals ( Ma et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , it is unlikely that it is secreted via the type I pathway or via the Sec or Tat pathway . In a previous report , it was suggested that cell lysis was responsible for release of LecB into the extracellular medium ( Wentworth et al . , 1991 ) . This hypothesis seems unlikely , as we have found that mutant LecB was produced in the cytoplasm in the same amount as the wild - type protein ( see Fig . 5b ) , but it was neither translocated into the outer membrane nor released into the extracellular space . In conclusion , our ﬁndings support the notion that LecB may contribute to the pathogenicity of P . aeruginosa in CF in several different ways and therefore represents an interesting target for the development of anti - P . aeruginosa drugs .
