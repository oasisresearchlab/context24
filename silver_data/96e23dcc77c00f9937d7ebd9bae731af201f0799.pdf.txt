Alongside informal channels of communication such as personal communications and interactions , scholars today rely heavily on a central infrastructure of scholarly publishing : a system of monographs , abstracts , and papers in journals and proceedings , overlaid with citation indices and search databases . Together , this comprises the formal scholarly record . Through this scholarly communication infrastructure , scholars have access to a vast and rapidly growing literature , across disciplines — on the order of hundreds of millions of documents accessible through just a few clicks and keystrokes from a single search engine [ 9 ] — from which they can draw to construct new knowledge . How well does this infrastructure serve scholarly needs of shar - ing , reusing , and synthesizing knowledge ? Consider a researcher who wants to understand what interventions might be most promis - ing for mitigating online harassment . To synthesize an understand - ing of this complex interdisciplinary problem to advance the state of the art , she needs to work through detailed answers to a range of questions : which theories have the most empirical support in this particular setting ? Are there conflicting theoretical predictions that might signal fruitful areas of inquiry ? What key phenomena should be kept in mind when designing an intervention ( e . g . , perceptions of human vs . automated action , procedural considerations , noise in judgments of wrongdoing , scale considerations for spread of harm ) ? What intervention patterns are both theoretically predicted to be effective in this setting , and lack direct evidence of efficacy ? The answers to these questions lie at granular levels of theoretical and empirical claims and their interrelationships , not publications . For example , " viewers in a Twitch chat engaged in less bad behaviors after a user was banned by a moderator for bad behavior " , and " ban - ning bad actors from a subreddit in 2015 was somewhat effective at mitigating spread of hate speech on other subreddits " are claims that 278 CSCW’22 Companion , November 8 – 22 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Taiwan Joel Chan , et al . interrelate in complex ways , both supporting other claims / theories that are in tension with each other . This level of granularity is crucial not just for finding relevant claims to inform the synthesis , but also for constructing more complex arguments and theories , by connecting statements in logical and discursive relationships . Our researcher also needs to work through a range of contextual details . For example , to judge which studies , findings , or theories are most applicable to her setting , she needs to know key methodological details including the comparability of different studies’ interven - tions , settings , populations , and outcome measures . She might need to reason over the fact that two studies that concluded limited ef - ficacy of bans had ban interventions that were quite short , on a forum with no identity verification . To judge what findings have been established with sufficient certainty and where the frontier might be , she would need to know , which findings came from which measures ( e . g . , self - report , behavioral measures ) , and the extent to which findings have been replicated across authors from different labs , and across a variety of settings ( e . g . , year , platform , scale ) . Where appropriate , she would need integrated access to methods , protocols , and data . How might this researcher retrieve , reuse , and synthesize this information from our current scholarly communication infrastruc - ture ? Search engines operate over documents and their metadata ( authorship , date , publication outlet ) , not claims and their context and relationships ; scholarly documents are primarily archived as unstructured text , often in PDFs . If she is lucky , she might come across a published synthesis that is both on topic , with sufficient coverage , and up to date ; that would likely be difficult for an inter - disciplinary topic such as hers ! Perhaps she might also be able to piece together leads on papers and authors and verbal statements of key ideas from knowledgeable colleagues . Failing all this , she would need to do the laborious work of citation tracing , manually checking references because citation databases typically do not sur - face information about why and in what way scholarly works cite each other , and collecting documents through keyword searches and then screening first the titles and abstracts and then their full text , and then constructing her own database of claims and data , often in a bespoke system of notes , annotations , and spreadsheets . This example illustrates how the current scholarly commu - nication infrastructure is not acting as infrastructure for synthesis . The term infrastructure is meant to evoke reliability , sustainability , and " smooth functioning " that enables people to fo - cus on the task at hand instead of fussing over preparatory overhead [ 5 , 20 ] . Instead of this smooth functioning , as the preceding example illustrates , researchers make do with an assemblage of workarounds and hacks to find and synthesize relevant literature . While these hacks often work well enough for the task at hand , they are rarely transferred in systematic ways across projects and people , violating the dimensions of " reach or scope " and " embodiment of standards " of infrastructure [ 20 ] . These are also not " one - time " costs : scientific problems require many such queries , and likely spawn new queries as projects evolve and more is learned . It is unsurprising , then , that synthesis of prior literature is often subpar [ 2 , 8 , 13 , 14 ] . Similarly , systematic reviews are increasingly struggling to keep up with the pace of knowledge , with many becoming outdated soon after they are published [ 17 ] , but are rarely updated [ 6 ] . In this workshop , we ask : how might we design scholarly communication infrastructures that are actually optimized for sharing , reusing , and synthesizing knowledge ? And where might these issues intersect with CSCW , to stimulate fresh so - ciotechnical progress and theoretical development ? This set of ques - tions has deep roots within CSCW , connecting with long - standing threads of work on of work has continued to the present , studying the collaborative , practical , and social work of constructing and maintaining scientific knowledge infrastructures [ 15 , 16 , 21 , 23 ] , distributed cognition and organizational memory [ 1 ] , systems for peer production of knowledge , such as Wikipedia [ 12 ] , complex sensemaking in collaborative and distributed settings [ 3 , 7 , 22 ] , and social computing and human - machine systems for synthesis [ 10 , 19 ] . In the cognate field of library and information science , too , there are decades of standards and platform - level work on new scholarly communication infrastructures that incorporate more sophistical models of semantics and scientific argumentation to support synthesis [ 4 , 11 , 18 ] . We aim to stimulate fresh progress by bringing these deep roots into conversation with emerging trends in science and infrastruc - ture reform and innovation , such as new institutions for science outside the academy that are deliberately structured to pursue dif - ferent incentive structures , such as Invisible College , the Arcadia Institute , and LabDAO ; new coordination structures and technolo - gies , including open - source community publishing platforms like PubPub , and patterns from emerging technology around Decentral - ized Science and new decentralized Web infrastructures , such as IPFS ; and new experiments in science funding , from crowdfunding to larger investments in creating new kinds of scientific institutes . The potential intersection of these communities and technologi - cal developments offers new opportunities to grow new technical infrastructures on top of a different installed base than the publish or perish , neoliberal academy . We aim for these new infrastructural patterns to synergize and combine with long - running advances and innovations in open science ( sharing of code , data , and pro - tocols ) and open access and preprints . We hope this new wave of sociotechnical innovation will catalyze bottom - up evolution and growth towards new infrastructures for sharing , reusing , and syn - thesizing knowledge . Some examples of concrete topics include : • " living " syntheses that respond appropriately to retracted , outdated , or inconsistent findings as knowledge evolves ; • integrating formality and machine readability — e . g . , on - tologies , semantic markup , or argumentation patterns of relationships between lines of work — while respecting the limits of machine intelligence , maintaining diversity of per - spectives and epistemologies , and balancing the need for tacit and contextual knowledge required for synthesis ; • integrating novel forms of scholarly authorship and knowl - edge sharing into everyday individual and collaborative scholarly practices and workflows , and novel assemblages , bricolages , and repurposing of existing tooling to enable these integrations ; • the role of AI and machine learning systems in assisting — vs . automating — the construction of new synthesis - optimized knowledge sharing infrastructures ; 279 Growing New Infrastructures for Sharing , Reusing , and Synthesizing Knowledge CSCW’22 Companion , November 8 – 22 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Taiwan • the role of decentralized peer - to - peer technologies , and new developments in hypertext and personal knowledge graphs , in lowering barriers to community - owned and maintained syntheses of scientific knowledge ; • and applications and design patterns from crowdsourcing and social computing for new forms of scholarly communi - cation infrastructure . 2 WORKSHOP GOALS , STRUCTURE , AND PARTICIPANTS The purpose of this proposed two - day workshop is to catalyze new collaborations , prototypes , and research ideas at the intersection of research , tooling , and practice communities . Thus , the workshop will be structured around synchronous and asynchronous work sessions in working groups . This will include scheduled time to form and refine proposals , and short lightning talks about concrete proposals for artifacts to create , such as new syntheses / aggregations of resources and research theories and findings , pilot user studies and prototypes with novel tooling , and new designs and lo - fi proto - types . We will also schedule for an extended synchronous session at the end of the workshop to share progress , with ample time for discussion , feedback , and planning of next steps . All sessions will also be recorded and shared with participants to allow for contin - ued participation if time zones conflict . We also plan to organize a venue for invited publication of the mature results of the collaborations , approximately 3 - 6 months after the conclusion of the workshop . We envision the venue being a combination of community - owned open access publications , such as on PubPub , and a co - authored overview article in a more traditional publication such as CSCW or CACM . We estimate that the overall available time for synchronous work , accounting for time zone differences , will be on the order of 5 - 6 hours across the two days of the workshop . To maximize the likelihood of this focused time leading to concrete outputs , we will also design asynchronous structured activities in the lead - up to the workshop . Prospective participants will submit materials for consideration , appropriate for their background and interests : researchers will submit short summaries of their past relevant research , and / or detailed annotated bibliographies ; tool - builders will submit video demos , and / or links to learn and try out their tools ; practitioners will submit case studies of their attempts to shift practice ( along with problems and opportunities / solutions they have discovered ) , and / or training materials for practice innovations , and example datasets . These submissions will be reviewed by the organizers according to criteria of relevance for the core workshop themes , as well as balance across communities of research , tooling , and practice . Accepted submissions ( announced in early - October ) will then be curated into a shared github repository of materials . In the subsequent weeks leading to the workshop , participants will comment on and iterate on the ideas and resources in the repository . The materials in this repository will serve as important context and resources to fuel impactful collaborative work during the workshop . We will also host a chat platform , such as Discord or gitter , to facilitate interactions between participants prior to the workshop . Prior to the workshop , the organizing team will propose topical and time - zone - based groupings of participants . Participants will be invited to use these proposals as starting points for forming working groups . Given the time constraints and goals of producing and sharing work outputs , we expect that the maximum number of participants will be 20 - 30 ( to aim for no more than 5 - 6 working groups ) . We aim to recruit participants from personal connections ( to organizations like Arcadia and Invisible College ) , Twitter ( where many from the new infrastructural reforms are being discussed ) , and Discords ( where many DeSci efforts are being coordinated ) . 3 PROPOSED SCHEDULE Prospective participants will submit proposed materials by late Sep - tember , and receive notifications by early October . Pre - workshop activities , including commenting and iterating on materials , as well as initial formation of working groups , in the github repository and over our hosted chat platform , will begin shortly thereafter , and continue up to the workshop dates . We plan to limit synchronous joint sessions to 3 hours in the morning of US East timezone , to maximize overlap in schedules across Asia , Europe , and the US . This schedule will be adjusted as needed based on the final set of participants . To maximize informal and spontaneous interactions , we plan to host the workshop on gather . town . All sessions will also be recorded and shared with par - ticipants to allow for continued participation if time zones conflict . The following is a proposed rough schedule ( in US Eastern time ) . Day 1 : • 09 : 30 - 09 : 40 - Welcome and kickoff • 09 : 40 - 10 : 10 - Working groups finalize proposals • 10 : 10 - 11 : 40 - Work sprint 1 • 11 : 40 - 12 : 25 - Working group proposal lightning talks • Various times ( depending on time zone ) : Work sprint 2 Day 2 : • 09 : 30 - 12 : 30 - Working group proposal progress reports and discussion • 12 : 40 - 12 : 50 - Closing call to action , next steps 4 BACKGROUND OF THE ORGANIZERS Joel Chan is an Assistant Professor in the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies .
