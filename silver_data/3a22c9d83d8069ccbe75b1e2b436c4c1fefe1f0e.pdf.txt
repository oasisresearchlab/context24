The repetitive nature of the underlying centromeric sequence represents a major obstacle for high - resolution mapping of protein binding using methods that rely on annotated genomes . Here , we present a novel microscopy - based approach called “APEX - chromatin fibers” for localizing protein binding over the repetitive centromeric sequences at kilobase resolution . Results : By fusing centromere factors of interest to ascorbate peroxidase , we were able to label their binding profiles on extended chromatin fibers with biotin marks . We applied APEX - chromatin fibers to at least one member of each CCAN complex , most of which show a localization pattern different from CENP - A but within the CENP - A deline - ated centromeric domain . Interestingly , we describe here a novel characteristic of CENP - I and CENP - B that display extended localization beyond the CENP - A boundaries . Conclusions : Our approach was successfully applied for mapping protein association over centromeric chroma - tin , revealing previously undescribed localization patterns . In this study , we focused on centromeric factors , but we believe that this approach could be useful for mapping protein binding patterns in other repetitive regions .

Introduction The centromere is a specialized chromosomal locus that serves as the platform for the assembly of a multi - protein complex known as the kinetochore [ 1 ] . The kinetochore constitutes the structural element that mediates the interaction with microtubules , in order to ensure faith - ful chromosome segregation during every cell division [ 2 ] . At its base lies centromeric chromatin containing the centromere - specific histone CENP - A and the constitu - tive centromere - associated network of proteins ( CCAN ) , and both together form the inner kinetochore . In mitosis , the CCAN serves as a binding platform for outer kine - tochore proteins that mediate direct interactions with microtubules [ 2 , 3 ] . CENP - A is a histone H3 - variant and considered to be the epigenetic mark for centromere identity as it has been shown to be sufficient for the specification and the epigenetic propagation of the centromere [ 4 – 8 ] . Cen - tromeric chromatin is composed of interspersed blocks of CENP - A and H3 nucleosomes [ 9 ] and is decorated by both euchromatic and heterochromatic chromatin marks , while it is flanked by pericentric heterochromatin [ 10 – 12 ] . The CCAN consists of 16 proteins which can be grouped into five different sub - complexes : the CENP - H / I / K / M , the CENP - L / N , CENP - O / P / Q / U / R , CENP - T / W / S / X complexes , and CENP - C [ 2 , 3 ] . CENP - C plays a central role in the CCAN since it can directly bind both the CENP - A nucleosome and members of the outer kinetochore complex [ 7 , 13 – 19 ] . CENP - N was also shown to directly bind the CENP - A - con - taining nucleosome , while all the CCAN members together are thought to create a complex meshwork of Open Access Epigenetics & Chromatin * Correspondence : patrick . heun @ ed . ac . uk 3 Wellcome Centre for Cell Biology , University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh , UKFull list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 interactions important both for sustaining the kine - tochore structure and function but also involved in the propagation of the epigenetic mark by recruiting fac - tors responsible for the incorporation of new CENP - A [ 2 , 3 ] . Even though centromeres in most organisms are epigenetically defined , and no specific DNA sequence seems to be sufficient to drive centromere forma - tion , CENP - B is a protein constitutively present at all human and mouse centromeres , except for the Y - chro - mosome , by binding a specific 17 - bp DNA motif , termed the CENP - B box [ 20 – 23 ] . Recent reports high - light the requirement of CENP - B for the stabilization of both CENP - A and CENP - C at centromeres [ 5 , 24 , 25 ] . Notably , CENP - B was also shown to be required for the successful assembly of human artificial chro - mosomes [ 26 , 27 ] , pointing toward an important role in centromere establishment . Despite the fact that remarkable advances have been made in understanding the interactions of CCAN members and centromeric chromatin , these have been mainly restricted to the nucleosomal level , namely a view of a dinucleosome H3 - CENP - A particle and its interactions with different CCAN members [ 2 ] . Other studies have focused on the super - resolution organiza - tion of the kinetochore at the highly compacted meta - phase chromosomes [ 28 , 29 ] or extended kinetochore fibers [ 30 ] . However , how the CCAN members are organized over the centromeric chromatin domain rel - ative to CENP - A remains unclear . This is mainly due to the repetitive nature of centromeric sequences that does not allow the high - resolution mapping of CCAN and other centromeric proteins at endogenous cen - tromeres using conventional methods , such as chro - matin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) followed by DNA sequencing , that rely on annotated genomes . Here , we developed a novel microscopy - based approach , which we call “APEX - chromatin fibers” , for high - resolution mapping of centromeric proteins onto centromeric chromatin . Using proximity - mediated ligation of biotin , this method allowed us to indirectly map the association sites of these proteins on chro - matin fibers in relation to CENP - A . We systematically mapped members of all the CCAN complexes and describe novel localization patterns at centromeres . Importantly , we demonstrate that both CENP - B and CENP - I , unlike all the other tested CCAN mem - bers , expand beyond the CENP - A - bound centromere domain . While here we focused on centromeric fac - tors , we believe that our approach could be a useful tool for mapping protein association in other repeti - tive genomic regions . Results A novel approach for mapping protein association at repetitive sequences The extended chromatin fibers method was proven ben - eficial for elucidating the organization of centromeric chromatin in interspersed blocks of CENP - A and post - translationally modified H3 nucleosomes [ 9 , 10 ] . We decided to take advantage of this established method and develop it further in order to decipher the overall spa - tial organization of centromere - associated proteins over centromeric chromatin . For the preparation of chroma - tin fibers , a lysis buffer containing high concentration of salt and detergent ( salt - detergent lysis buffer ) [ 31 ] or the less disruptive low - ionic strength TEEN buffer has been used to allow for breaking up nuclei and the sub - sequent stretching of chromatin fibers [ 30 , 32 – 34 ] . In this study , we further introduced an extra lysis step in the salt - detergent buffer prior to fixation and achieved better stretching of the centromeric fiber , since longer stretches of CENP - A were obtained ( Fig . 1a ) . Each of the three methods ( TEEN buffer , single and double lysis with salt - detergent lysis buffer ) was analyzed for their extent of stretching and preservation of centromere factor stain - ing . While TEEN buffer allows for different centromeric proteins like CENP - B and CENP - C to be retained on the chromatin fiber , it achieves only relatively short fib - ers , as shown by the domain size occupied by CENP - A ( Fig . 1a , b ) . In turn , the higher degree of stretching and resolution of the double lysis approach comes at the cost of stripping most non - nucleosomal centromere proteins , including the members of the CCAN complexes , from the chromatin fiber , similar to the single lysis using the salt - detergent buffer ( Fig . 1b ) . To overcome this problem and inspired by the DamID method [ 35 ] , we took advantage of an existing proxim - ity - dependent protein labeling method that employs the enzyme Ascorbate Peroxidase 2 ( APEX ) and devel - oped a novel microscopy - based approach to map protein – chromatin association , which we call “APEX - chromatin fibers” . More specifically , we fused our pro - teins of interest to the engineered APEX which oxidizes phenol derivatives , like biotin - phenol , in the presence of H 2 O 2 [ 36 , 37 ] and produces highly reactive molecules that can attack electron - rich amino acids of proteins in very close proximity ( < 20 nm ) [ 38 ] . Combined with the extended chromatin fiber preparation , this method should allow to indirectly visualize the localization of proteins of interest fused to APEX by detecting bioti - nylation of salt - resistant chromatin proteins ( Fig . 2a ) . Therefore , we transiently expressed centromeric pro - teins fused to myc - APEX ( about 28 kDa ) in U2OS cells for three days , induced biotinylation through addition of biotin - phenol and H 2 O 2 , and prepared double lysis Page 3 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 extended chromatin fibers . Centromeres were marked by staining for CENP - A , and biotinylation was detected with Streptavidin conjugated to Alexa555 ( Fig . 2a ) . As a proof - of - principle , we started by analyzing APEX - myc - CENP - A and compared its biotinylation pattern to endogenous CENP - A , which itself is retained on chromatin fibers and can be used as a direct refer - ence . We first confirmed that the fusion protein is expressed and correctly targeted to the centromere by IF on interphase cells and mitotic chromosomes , and immunoblotting ( Fig . 2b , Additional file 1 : Figure S1A , B ) . Biotinylation was observed specifically at the centromeres only in the presence of biotin - phenol and not DMSO ( Fig . 2b , Additional file 1 : Figure S1A ) , indi - cating that the labeling reaction is spatially restricted to the centromeric region , and that the myc - APEX tag does not influence CENP - A localization . Next , we prepared extended chromatin fibers and compared the CENP - A and biotin profile over the centromere region ( Fig . 2c ) . As expected , no biotinylation was observed in the DMSO - treated preparations , while the bioti - nylation profile in the biotin - phenol - treated sample revealed a large overlap with the CENP - A staining . For more detailed analysis of the biotinylation profile , we focused on the intensity profile of the staining along the fiber ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1C , Materials and Meth - ods ) . We found that about 70 % of total CENP - A peaks co - localize with biotin , while 86 % of the total biotin peaks co - localize with CENP - A ( Fig . 2d ) . We also ana - lyzed the distribution of the CENP - A - mediated biotin peaks and found that only 12 . 7 % do not co - localize with CENP - A , and a minor fraction ( 1 . 3 % ) are found outside the centromere reference domain ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1D ) . Together , the above results show that the biotinylation profile on the chromatin fibers from cells expressing APEX - myc - CENP - A is very similar to the pattern of endogenous CENP - A , despite a noticeable amount ( 14 % ) of biotin signals not perfectly co - local - izing with CENP - A , which could be considered as the error of the method . Hence , for each APEX fusion pro - tein that we subsequently analyzed , we used the overlap of APEX - CENP - A - mediated biotinylation relative to endogenous CENP - A as the reference for comparison . In order to address how the CCAN proteins are organ - ized overall over centromeric chromatin , we applied APEX - chromatin fibers and analyzed the resulting bioti - nylation profiles . For each CCAN complex ( CENP - C , CENP - H / I / K / M , CENP - L / N , CENP - O / P / Q / U / R and CENP - T / W / S / X ) , we mapped at least one member to analyze the number of peaks and how they are distrib - uted over the centromere domain defined by CENP - A , allowing us to group them in different categories of dis - tribution patterns . CENP‑C , CENP‑N and CENP‑T APEX fusions are confined inside the CENP‑A‑bound domain but are differently organized than APEX‑CENP‑A First , we mapped CENP - C , which lies at the foundation of the kinetochore and is a key component of the CCAN . Following the confirmation that the APEX - CENP - C fusion protein is expressed and correctly targeted to centromeres ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2A ) , we analyzed the biotinylation profile on the chromatin fibers in rela - tion to CENP - A ( Fig . 3a , b , Additional file 1 : Figure S2D ) . Interestingly , significantly fewer CENP - C - mediated bio - tin peaks co - localize with CENP - A when compared to APEX - CENP - A ( 72 % vs . 86 % , Fig . 2b ) . This suggests that a fraction of CENP - C localizes at places where CENP - A is absent . In addition , we found that CENP - C is organized 0 5 10 15 20 Double lysis Single lysis TEEN buffer CENP - A ( m ) S a l t - d e t e r g e n t l ys i s bu ff e r CENP - A CENP - A CENP - A a b D oub l e l ys i s S a l t - d e t e r g e n t l ys i s bu ff e r S i ng l e l ys i s T EE N bu ff e r CENP - A CENP - B MERGE CENP - A CENP - C MERGE CENP - A CENP - B MERGE CENP - A CENP - C MERGE CENP - A CENP - B MERGE CENP - A CENP - C MERGE domain Fig . 1 Comparison of different methods for chromatin fiber preparation . a Scatter plot depicting the size of CENP - A domain on chromatin fibers prepared with three different methods ( left panel ) .

We then mapped CENP - N , a member of the CENP - L / N complex , which similarly to CENP - C was also found to be a direct binder of the CENP - A nucleosome [ 13 , 39 ] . After analyzing the biotinylation profile on chroma - tin fibers prepared from cells expressing CENP - N - APEX ( Fig . 3c , Additional file 1 : Figure S2B ) , we found that like CENP - C , CENP - N is organized in a similar number of peaks as APEX - CENP - A ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2E ) . In addition , similar to CENP - C , the CENP - N - mediated biotin peaks do not perfectly co - localize with CENP - A ( only 66 % of the total peaks shows co - localization with CENP - A ) but are also all confined inside the centromere domain ( Fig . 3d ) .

While super - reso - lution imaging of stretched kinetochore fibers places it closer to the H3 blocks composing centromeric chro - matin [ 30 ] , more recent findings using ChIP followed by sequencing of young α - satellites place CENP - T in the center of the CENP - B box , between two CENP - A nucleosomes [ 40 ] . It was also shown that it interacts both with CENP - B and CENP - C [ 40 ] . Our analysis of the biotinylation profiles shows that CENP - T is organ - ized in similar number of peaks as APEX - CENP - A ( Fig . 3e , Additional file 1 : Figure S2C , F ) but a smaller portion of those co - localize with CENP - A ( 72 % vs . 86 % ) ( Fig . 3f ) . Similar to CENP - C and CENP - N , we also find CENP - T to be confined inside the centromere domain but not exclusively where CENP - A is ( Fig . 3f ) . This defines our first category of association pat - terns , in which proteins are confined within the CENP - A domain , but reveal a pattern that is distinct from APEX - CENP - A , and includes CENP - C , CENP - N and CENP - T . CENP‑P , CENP‑K and CENP‑M APEX fusions are organized similarly to APEX‑CENP‑A Other CCAN members presented different distribution profiles than the one discussed above . For the CENP - O / P / Q / U / R complex we focused only on CENP - P . A CENP - P - APEX fusion was transiently expressed in U2OS cells ( Additional file 1 : Figure S3A ) and chromatin fibers were prepared ( Fig . 4a ) . We then analyzed the biotinylation profile of CENP - P and found that it is not significantly different from the biotinylation profile mediated by APEX - CENP - A ( Fig . 4a , b , Additional file 1 : Figure S3D ) . In particular , the ratio of biotin to CENP - A peaks is not significantly different between the CENP - P and CENP - A - APEX fusions ( Additional file 1 : Figure S3D ) . Similarly , the distribution of the biotin peaks over the centromere domain does not differ significantly ( Fig . 4b ) . For the CENP - H / I / K / M complex , we mapped CENP - I , CENP - K and CENP - M . CENP - K and CENP - M were also found to be organized in a similar pattern to APEX - CENP - A ( Fig . 4c – f , Additional file 1 : Figure S3B , C , E , F ) . In particular , we find that neither the number of bio - tin peaks mediated by CENP - K and CENP - M nor their distribution is significantly different from the respective number in cells expressing APEX - CENP - A ( Additional file 1 : Figure S3E - F , Fig . 4d , f ) . This defines a second category of distribution pat - terns , in which proteins are confined within the CENP - A domain and show no significantly different organization from APEX - CENP - A , and includes CENP - P , CENP - M and CENP - K . CENP‑I and CENP‑B extend outside the centromere domain We next focused on the localization of CENP - I on chro - matin fibers . After confirming the expression of the APEX - tagged protein and its specific localization at centromeres ( Fig . 5a , Additional file 1 : Figure S4A - C ) , we analyzed its biotinylation pattern . Unlike CENP - K and CENP - M of the CENP - H / I / K / M complex , CENP - I exhibited a different distribution profile that falls in nei - ther of the first two categories . First , it is organized in more peaks than APEX - CENP - A over the centromere ( Additional file 1 : Figure S4D ) and a large proportion of biotin peaks does not co - localize with CENP - A inside the centromere ( Fig . 5b ) . Surprisingly , a significant per - centage of peaks ( 11 . 7 % ) are also located outside the centromere domain and a large proportion of the fibers analyzed ( > 50 % ) show this “spreading” pattern ( Fig . 5b , e ) . In addition to the CCAN members , we also explored the high - resolution localization of CENP - B , a DNA - bind - ing protein present at all human and mouse centromeres except for the Y - chromosome . It binds a motif termed the CENP - B box , which is present in the α - satellite sequences [ 21 ] . After confirming that the CENP - B - APEX fusion protein is expressed , targeted and is specifically active at centromeres ( Additional file 1 : Figure S4E , F ) , we analyzed its biotinylation profile on chromatin fib - ers ( Fig . 5c ) . Similar to CENP - I , we found that CENP - B is organized in more peaks over centromeric chromatin when compared to APEX - CENP - A ( Additional file 1 : Figure S4G ) and inside the centromere domain not all biotin peaks co - localize with CENP - A ( Fig . 5d ) . Inter - estingly , on the majority of fibers ( > 70 % ) , we find that a significant proportion of CENP - B - APEX - mediated biotin peaks ( 16 . 2 % ) are located outside the centromere domain ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Our measurements revealed that both CENP - B - and CENP - I - mediated biotin peaks spread significantly fur - ther away from the CENP - A domain as compared to APEX - CENP - A ( Fig . 5f ) . In agreement with this , the domain that is occupied by the CENP - I and CENP - B - mediated biotin is significantly larger than the respective domain corresponding to APEX - CENP - A ( Fig . 5g ) . In summary , by applying APEX - chromatin fibers for mapping protein organization over centromeric chro - matin , three different association patterns of centromere factors over centromeric chromatin were revealed ( Fig . 5h ) . In the first category , in which CENP - C , CENP - N and CENP - T fall , the centromeric factors are confined inside the CENP - A - bound centromere domain , but are organized differently than the biotin marks deposited by APEX - CENP - A . In the second category , CENP - P , CENP - M and CENP - K are also confined inside the centromere domain but their pattern is similar to the biotinylation Page 7 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 a CENP - A CENP - P 0 25 50 75 100 125 APEX fusion % o f t o t a l b i o t i n p eaks ns nsns b C E N P - M - m yc - A PEX Biotin CENP - A MERGE 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 CENP - M - Biotin CENP - A G r ey va l u e co - localizing with CENP - A not co - localizing with CENP - A inside CENP - A domain outside CENP - A domain CENP - A CENP - M 0 25 50 75 100 125 APEX fusion % o f t o t a l b i o t i n p eaks ns nsns d c Biotin CENP - A MERGE A PEX - m yc - C E N P - P CENP - P - Biotin CENP - A G r ey va l u e 0 2 4 6 8 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 Biotin CENP - A MERGE C E N P K - m yc - A PEX 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 G r ey va l u e CENP - K - Biotin CENP - A CENP - A CENP - K 0 25 50 75 100 125 APEX fusion % o f t o t a l b i o t i n p eaks ns ns ns e f Fig . 4 CENP - P - , CENP - K and CENP - M - APEX are organized similarly to APEX - CENP - A .

In the last cate - gory , CENP - I and CENP - B were found to extend beyond the centromere domain . Endogenous CENP‑B and CENP‑I spread further outside the CENP‑A‑bound domain To confirm that the “spreading” pattern observed for CENP - B and CENP - I APEX fusions was not a result of overexpression of the transgenic APEX constructs , we prepared fibers using the TEEN buffer that allows the retention of different centromeric proteins ( Fig . 1b ) . By using antibodies against the endogenous proteins , we visualized CENP - B , CENP - I , CENP - C , CENP - H and CENP - T on TEEN fibers ( Fig . 6a , b , Additional file 1 : Fig - ure S5A - C ) . In agreement with the “spreading” pattern observed using our APEX approach , we find that the dis - tance that endogenous CENP - B or CENP - I spread out - side the CENP - A domain is significantly higher than the equivalent distance for CENP - C , CENP - H and CENP - T ( Fig . 6c ) . To test whether transient expression of the APEX - tagged proteins might exacerbate their spreading outside the CENP - A domain , we prepared fibers using the TEEN buffer from cells expressing either CENP - I or CENP - B APEX fusions ( Additional file 1 : Figure S5D - G ) . We did not observe a difference in the comparison for CENP - I , indicating that expression of the transgene does not affect its spreading . For CENP - B , we noticed a slight increase in average domain size for CENP - B , suggesting that additional CENP - B has a small effect on expanding further beyond the CENP - A domain than endogenous CENP - B does . To investigate whether CENP - B and CENP - I spread - ing correlates , we used CENP - C as a marker for the cen - tromere domain and simultaneously stained for both CENP - B and CENP - I . When we analyzed fibers that show spreading outside the centromere domain , we found that only 29 % show both CENP - B and CENP - I spreading outside the centromere domain ( Fig . 7a ) . In fact , most fibers show either CENP - B or CENP - I spread - ing alone ( 29 and 42 % , respectively ) ( Fig . 7a ) . Interest - ingly , in the vast majority of fibers with both proteins spreading outside the centromere domain , CENP - B and CENP - I are found together on the same side of the centromere domain ( 70 % ) ( Fig . 7b , c ) . Only in few cases CENP - B and CENP - I are located at the opposite sides of the centromere domain ( 12 % ) , while for some ( 18 % ) the two proteins are located together on one side and one of the two ( or both ) is also found on the opposite side of the centromere domain ( Fig . 7b ) . This suggests that when both CENP - B and CENP - I spread outside the centromere domain , they tend to localize on the same side . Discussion The extended chromatin fibers method has proven to be very useful to study the structural organization of cen - tromeric chromatin [ 9 , 10 , 41 ] . While some protocols favor stretching of the chromatin fiber and achieve bet - ter spatial resolution , their harsher lysis conditions come at the expense of many non - nucleosomal proteins being stripped from the chromatin . Accordingly , gentler lysis conditions ( e . g . , TEEN buffer ) allow the retention of chro - matin associated factors but result in shorter fibers . This led us to develop a method that achieves well - stretched chromatin fibers , yet maintains a read - out of protein association on the fiber , using biotinylation of chromatin . After successful establishment of the technique , we went on to elucidate the overall spatial organization of mem - bers of the CCAN over centromeric chromatin . Firstly , we were able to confirm the specificity of our approach by directly comparing the binding patterns of CENP - A and APEX - CENP - A - mediated biotin over cen - tromeric chromatin . As a control , we confirmed that in fixed interphase cells and mitotic chromosomes , bioti - nylation is restricted to the centromere . As expected , we Fig . 5 CENP - B - and CENP - I - APEX extend further than the CENP - A - bound centromere domain .

The first category includes CENP - C , - N and - T , which are confined inside the centromere domain but are differently organized than APEX - CENP - A . The second category includes CENP - P , - M and - K which are organized similarly to APEX - CENP - A . The last category includes CENP - I and CENP - B , which extend further than the centromere domain ( See figure on next page . ) Page 9 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 b a Biotin CENP - A MERGE CENP - I - Biotin CENP - A G r ey va l u e C E N P - I - m yc - A PEX 0 2 4 68 1 0 12 14 16 18 20 0 500 1000 1500 20002000 12000 22000 32000 c Biotin CENP - A MERGE 0 2 4 6 0 2500 5000 7500 10000 12500 15000 G r ey va l u e CENP - B - Biotin CENP - A A PEX - m yc - C E N P - B d CENP - A CENP - I 0 25 50 75 100 125 % o f t o t a l b i o t i n p eaks APEX fusion * * * * CENP - A CENP - B 0 25 50 75 100 125 % o f t o t a l b i o t i n p eaks APEX fusion * * * * ns co - localizing with CENP - A not co - localizing with CENP - A inside CENP - A domain outside CENP - A domain e f CENP - A CENP - B CENP - I 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 APEX fusion * * * CENP - ACENP - B CENP - I 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 APEX fusion * * * B i o t i n / C E N P - A do m a i n g 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 % o f f i b e r s s ho w i ng s p r ea d i ng C E N P - A C E N P - I APEX fusion C E N P - B * * Category 2 : CENP - P , - K and - M Confined in centromere domain in a similar distribution Category 1 : CENP - C , - N and - T Confined in centromere domain but different distribution Category 3 : CENP - I and - B Extend beyond the centromere domain CENP - A centromeric protein h Page 10 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 observe strong overlap of the CENP - A and biotin staining in the chromatin fibers , with 86 % of the CENP - A - medi - ated biotin peaks overlapping with CENP - A . A minor population ( 14 % ) of the biotin signals did not perfectly overlap with the CENP - A antibody staining , which could be explained by higher sensitivity in the detection of bio - tin as compared to CENP - A , and could be attributed as the error of the method . We could further confirm that biotinylation was restricted inside the CENP - A - bound centromere domain , suggesting that unspecific biotinyla - tion is not introduced to the adjacent chromatin . Having confirmed the specificity of our labeling approach , we mapped at least one member of each CCAN complex . We found biotin deposited by CENP - P , - K and - M to be organized similarly to biotin deposited by APEX - CENP - A over centromeric chromatin . CENP - P and the other members of the CENP - O / P / Q / U / R complex were described to be very close to centromeric chromatin in mitotic kinetochores [ 29 ] , while all three proteins , CENP - P , CENP - K and CENP - M , were reported to be important for proper kinetochore function but with no specialized role at the centromere . It was only recently that the complex , and in particular CENP - Q , was shown to play an important role in microtubule binding cooperatively with members of the outer kine - tochore [ 42 ] . Surprisingly , despite the fact that CENP - C and CENP - N were reported to directly interact with CENP - A - contain - ing nucleosomes [ 13 , 17 , 39 , 43 , 44 ] , we found that nei - ther of the two overlaps perfectly with CENP - A inside the centromere domain , but instead are also found in places where CENP - A is not present . Our finding might also point to the possibility that CENP - C or CENP - N interacts with proteins other than CENP - A or the CCAN at centro - meric chromatin , which are yet to be identified . CENP - C has been described to possess DNA - binding ability [ 45 , 46 ] . It is , therefore , possible that following its targeting to the centromere , it can associate with DNA in addition to its interaction with CENP - A nucleosomes , allowing it to be stably bound on centromeric chromatin even in places where there is no CENP - A , e . g . , after its distribu - tion to the two sister chromatids following DNA replica - tion . Likewise , CENP - N’s association with other CCAN members [ 44 , 47 ] might confer stability for binding over centromeric chromatin , despite the absence of CENP - A nucleosomes . While super - resolution study of chicken kinetochore fibers [ 30 ] , FRET analyses [ 48 ] and ChIP data [ 49 ] place CENP - T in close proximity to the H3 - rich domains of the centromere domain , we find that a high percentage ( 72 % ) of CENP - T peaks co - localize with CENP - A . This could be explained by the fact that the CENP - A signals seen on the chromatin fibers contain several CENP - A nucleosomes [ 9 ] and CENP - T was found to co - immunoprecipitate with CENP - A nucleosomes when chromatin was not fully digested [ 49 – 51 ] . In addition , it has recently been shown that in ChIP experiments carried out on young α - satellites , CENP - T constitutes a bridge between adjacent CENP - A nucleosomes [ 40 ] , suggesting that the two proteins are in close proximity , in agreement with our findings . Interestingly , we found CENP - B and CENP - I to extend beyond the CENP - A - bound centromere domain . It is unclear what the role of these proteins is outside the CENP - A domain at centromeres , but their localization a b c C E N P - H C E N P - B C E N P - I C E N P - T C E N P - C D i s t a n ce o f s p r ea d i ng f r o m 0 1 2 3 * * CENP - B CENP - A MERGE 0 1 2 3 45 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 CENP - B CENP - A G r ey va l u e T EE N bu ff e r CENP - I CENP - A MERGE 0 1 2 3 4 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 CENP - I CENP - A G r ey va l u e T EE N bu ff e r Fig . 6 Endogenous CENP - B and CENP - I extend further than the CENP - A domain on TEEN fibers .

Intensity plots for each staining along the length of the fiber ( in μm ) are shown on the right Page 12 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 half the amount of CENP - B at centromeres is associated with canonical H3 and not CENP - A nucleosomes on the type - I α - satellite array [ 52 ] . CENP - B boxes are regu - larly distributed across the α - satellite arrays and CREST antibodies , which recognize mostly CENP - B , displayed staining of an entire α - satellite array on low resolution chromatin stretches [ 20 , 53 , 54 ] . In contrast , CENP - A was shown to bind only a fraction of the whole α - satellite array [ 55 – 57 ] . Thus , using an alternative approach , we confirm here the previous notion that CENP - B displays extended binding outside the centromere domain . Its localization beneath the kinetochore during mitosis further suggests that CENP - B has a specialized binding pattern over cen - tromeric chromatin [ 58 ] . CENP - B’s role is diverse and among others , it is able to promote heterochromatin for - mation in ectopically integrated alphoid DNA in mouse cells through interaction with Suv39h1 [ 27 ] . Its presence beyond the centromere domain might hint toward a role of CENP - B in regulating the boundary between centro - meric chromatin and pericentric heterochromatin . How - ever , it was unexpected that CENP - I extends further than the CENP - A domain . Similar to CENP - B [ 27 ] , CENP - I has additional roles as compared to the other members of the CENP - H / I / K / M complex , especially in promot - ing CENP - A assembly [ 59 , 60 ] . Given a recent report that suggests that new CENP - A is loaded preferentially at the boundaries of the centromere domain , to ensure main - tenance of the CENP - A - bound domain size [ 57 ] , it is intriguing to speculate that CENP - B and CENP - I might be involved in the regulation of this process , since they localize to the boundaries of centromeric domain . While in this study we focused on understanding the organization of CCAN proteins in relation to CENP - A , it would be very interesting for our approach to be combined with FISH in future experiments . Great efforts are being made in order to assemble human cen - tromeric sequences [ 61 – 65 ] , and specific centromere probes have been used in the past to study particular centromeres [ 56 , 66 ] . These studies could be extended with our protein - mapping approach combined with FISH , to elucidate the organization of each CCAN on centromeres of specific chromosomes . Such a novel combination of methods could also allow exploring whether the asymmetric spreading pattern of CENP - B and CENP - I is chromosome specific , especially since it is not observed in all fibers analyzed . It is notewor - thy that CENP - A is also asymmetrically distributed on some human chromosomes , especially the centromere of the X chromosome [ 55 , 57 ] . It would be therefore interesting to address whether the asymmetric distribu - tion of CENP - B and CENP - I correlates with that . Alter - natively , it would be interesting to understand that this asymmetric extension of CENP - B and CENP - I outside the CENP - A bound domain reflects the chromosomes that contain more than one adjacent α - satellite arrays containing CENP - B boxes which are not all bound by CENP - A , like on chromosome 17 [ 67 ] . Despite the advantages of our approach , we also acknowledge several limitations involved . Although the extended chromatin fibers method is the only avail - able method for higher resolution mapping of protein binding over repetitive regions , it undoubtedly does not achieve the resolution of ChIP coupled to sequenc - ing methods . Here , we focused on proteins that exclu - sively localize to centromeres , which can be identified and visualized by the specific presence of CENP - A . For proteins that display broad distribution across the genome , the analysis of the binding patterns can be challenging , in part due to the entanglement of sev - eral fibers . Moreover , our mapping was carried out in the presence of the endogenous protein , which possibly reduces the coverage of biotinylation . Indeed , we find that for APEX - CENP - A , a small proportion of CENP - A does not co - localize with biotin , suggesting that there are endogenous CENP - A binding sites not labeled with biotin ( Fig . 2d ) . This can be solved by endogenously tagging the genes of interest with APEX . Additionally , as biotinylation through APEX takes place in a radius of 20 nm , the localization of fusion proteins on chro - matin can only be detected if they are sufficiently close to proteins which can be retained on the chromatin fiber . A longer flexible linker between the protein of interest and APEX might help circumventing this limi - tation . Thus , our approach can be tailored for different experimental contexts and combined with other meth - ods such as FISH , and provide a powerful tool for map - ping protein distribution in other repetitive genomic regions . Conclusions In summary , we developed a novel approach that allowed us to map the overall association pattern of at least one member of each CCAN complex over cen - tromeric chromatin . We find that the CCAN is organ - ized in three categories of distribution profiles , in which some present a localization similar to CENP - A , in another proteins are confined inside the centromere domain but are differently distributed than CENP - A , and lastly two proteins were found to extend fur - ther than the centromere domain . In this study , we focused on centromeric factors , but we believe that our approach could be applicable for mapping protein dis - tribution in other repetitive regions . Page 13 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 Materials and methods Cell culture and transfections U2OS cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % Penicillin – Streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . Cells were seeded in 6 - well plates , a day prior to transfection at a density of 2 . 5 − 4 × 10 5 cells per well . Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 3000 ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions , using 2 . 5 μg of plasmid DNA and Opti - MEM I reduced serum medium ( Life Technologies ) . Downstream experiments were performed three days post - transfection . APEX induction APEX induction was carried out according to published methods [ 37 ] . Briefly , the cell medium was replaced by complete DMEM containing 500 μ Μ final biotin - phe - nol ( Iris biotech ) or DMSO ( control ) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . The APEX enzyme was induced by addition of 1 mM final H 2 O 2 diluted in 1XDPBS , in the medium , for 1 min at room temperature ( RT ) . Following the induction , the medium was aspirated and cells were washed three times with quencher solu - tion ( 10 mM sodium azide , 10 mM sodium ascorbate , 5 mM Trolox in 1XDPBS ) . Next , cells were washed once with 1XDPBS , trypsinized , counted and used for down - stream applications . Cytological preparations Cells were allowed to settle on Poly - lysine coated slides in a humidified chamber at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 for at least 1 h and were fixed with 3 . 7 % Formaldehyde in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 1XPBS ( PBST ) for 10 min at RT . For preparation of mitotic chromosomes , following trypsinization and before fixation as described above , 1 . 5 × 10 5 cells were treated with Colcemid ( 1 μg / ml ) for 30 min at 37 °C , gen - tly shaking . Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min at RT , and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer ( 75 mM KCl ) and incubated for 10 min at RT , before it was cytospun into a single - chamber cytospin funnel for 10 min at 900 rpm on high acceleration in a Shandon Cytospin 4 onto a poly - lysine coated glass slide . For preparation of chromatin fibers , 5 × 10 4 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min at RT . The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer ( 75 mM KCl ) and incubated for 10 min at RT . Then , they were transferred into a single - chamber cytospin funnel and spun for 4 min at 800 rpm on high acceleration in a Shandon Cytospin 4 onto a poly - lysine coated glass slide . For TEEN fibers , the slides were incu - bated in TEEN buffer ( 1 mM Triethanolamine - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA ) for 30 min , they were slowly pulled out the buffer and fixed in 3 . 7 % Formal - dehyde in TEEN buffer . Slides were then washed three times in 1XPBS and processed for indirect immuno - fluorescence . For extended chromatin fibers preparation using salt - detergent lysis buffer , the slides were quickly transferred into a Coplin jar containing freshly prepared salt - detergent lysis buffer ( 25 mM Tris , pH 9 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 500 mM Urea , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM PMSF ) , incubated for 20 min at RT and were then slowly pulled out of the buffer . For the double lysis protocol , slides were then washed in PBST for 15 min at RT and incubated again in fresh salt - detergent lysis buffer for 15 min at RT and were slowly pulled out the buffer . Chromatin fibers were fixed 3 . 7 % Formaldehyde in PBST for 10 min at RT . Indirect immunofluorescence Following fixation as described in each relevant appli - cation , the slides were washed once in PBST and then blocked in Image - iT ® FX signal enhancer in a humidified chamber at RT for at least 30 min . All antibodies were incubated in a 1 : 1 mix of PBST and 10 % normal goat serum ( Life Technologies ) overnight at 4 °C in a humidi - fied chamber and were used in 1 : 50 dilution unless other - wise stated : CENP - A ( Abcam - ab13939 , 1 : 100 ) , CENP - B ( Abcam - ab25734 , Santacruz - sc376283 ) , myc ( Abcam - ab9106 , 1 : 100 ) , CREST ( Europa Bioproducts , 1 : 200 ) , CENP - I ( Abcam - ab118796 ) , CENP - C and CENP - H ( Tat - suo Fukagawa ) , CENP - T ( Ben Black ) . All antibodies were used in 1 : 100 dilution on mitotic chromosome prepara - tions . Secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 , 555 and 647 ( Invitrogen ) or Streptavidin conjugated to Alexa 555 were used at 1 : 100 dilutions ( except Strepta - vidin Alexa 555 on chromatin fibers , which was used in 1 : 25 dilution ) . Counterstaining of DNA was performed with DAPI ( 5 µg / ml ) , and coverslips were mounted on the slides with 25 μl of SlowFade ® Gold antifade reagent . Immunoblots For preparation of protein extracts , cell pellets were washed once in warm 1XDPBS , counted and then resuspended directly in 2X Tris – Glycine SDS sample buffer ( Novex , Life Technologies ) in a concentration of 2 . 5 × 10 4 cells / μl , sonicated and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C . The samples were loaded on 10 or 15 % self - casted SDS – polyacrylamide gels , and blotted on Nitrocellulose membranes . Immunoblotting was conducted with the following primary antibodies : anti - CENP - A ( Abcam - ab13939 ) or CENP - I ( Abcam - ab118796 ) , both used in a dilution of 1 : 1000 . Microscopy All IF images were taken as 20 – 50 z - stacks of 0 . 2 μm increments , using a 100 × oil immersion objective on a Page 14 of 17 Kyriacou and Heun Epigenetics & Chromatin ( 2018 ) 11 : 68 Deltavision RT Elite Microscope and a CoolSNAP HQ Monochrome camera . All images were deconvolved using the aggressive deconvolution mode on a SoftWorx Explorer Suite ( Applied Precision ) and are shown as quick projections of maximum intensity . Image analysis and quantifications All images were analyzed on Fiji software [ 68 ] . Quick projections of maximum intensity of the deconvolved images were imported in the software and analyzed as follows : quantifications were manually performed on the intensity profile plots of each staining as described in Additional file 1 : Figure S1C . For the generation of the intensity profile plots , a segmented line was manu - ally drawn above the identified fiber . The intensity profile was calculated for each staining separately , and graphs were plotted in Excel . Each peak with a gray value ≥ 300 was marked as a peak for all experiments , except experi - ments with TEEN fibers where the threshold for antibody signals was set to 200 ( except Streptavidin , for which the signal threshold was 300 , as above ) . The distance between peaks was measured by calculating the differ - ence between the X - axis positions of each marked peak involved in the quantification . A “threshold for co - local - ization” was set to 0 . 192 μm ( 3 pixels ) since the average width of dots on the fibers was measured as ~ 4 to 5 pixels and based on the optical resolution limit . For quantifica - tions of the size of fibers in Fig . 1a , a segmented line was manually drawn above the identified fiber and using the “measure” tool on Fiji , the size was determined . At least 10 fibers were analyzed for each condition , pooled from at least 2 experiments , except the experiment in Fig . 1 , which was performed only once . Statistical analysis All statistical analyses and graphs construction were per - formed in GraphPad Prism version 7 . 02 for Windows ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla California USA , www . graph pad . com ) . Before performing any analysis , datasets were checked for normality by performing a Shapiro – Wilkin - son normality test . Parametric or nonparametric tests were performed accordingly , as indicated in each figure . P values were adjusted in R using the FDR method and are indicated in each figure .

Insets represent threefold magnifications of the boxed regions . Scale bar : 5 μm . ( B ) Immunoblot of protein extracts from cells transiently expressing APEX - CENP - A and untransfected U2OS cells , using an antibody against CENP - A . The bottom panel shows Ponceau staining of the blot . ( C ) Schematic for the analysis of plot profiles of extended chromatin fibers prepared with salt - detergent lysis buffer . Hypothetical intensity plot ( endogenous CENP - A in green , biotin in red ) . The dashed gray line depicts the gray value = 300 threshold . ( i ) Each peak with a gray value ≥ 300 was accounted . The number of peaks was calculated for each staining . To cor - rect for the size of different centromeres , the ratio of the number of biotin to endogenous CENP - A peaks was always calculated . ( ii ) Measurement of distances between closest peaks . The green arrow - headed line ( dCA ) depicts the distance between a CENP - A peak and its closest biotin peak while the red arrow - headed line ( db ) depicts the distance between a bio - tin peak and its closest CENP - A peak . The above distances were measured for each peak . If the distance between two peaks was ≤ 0 . 192 μm , they were marked as “co - localizing” peaks . These data allowed the calculation of the percentage of total biotin or CENP - A peaks co - localizing . ( iii ) The size of the domain covered by CENP - A ( centromere domain ) or biotin was determined by measuring the distance between the first and last peak of each staining . To correct for the size of different centromeres , the ratio of biotin to centromere domain size was always calculated . ( iv ) For calculat - ing the distance of spreading of biotin peaks outside the centromere domain ( ds ) the distance of the furthest biotin peak from the first CENP - A peak ( left and right ) was measured . If ds was ≤ 0 . 192 μm ( co - localizing with CENP - A ) or if no peaks were found outside the centromere domain , ds was set to zero . ( D ) Distribution of biotin peaks from cells express - ing APEX - CENP - A ( mean with SEM ) which were used as a reference for downstream analyses . Dark gray : percentage of peaks co - localizing with CENP - A , light gray : percentage of peaks not co - localizing with CENP - A inside the CENP - A - bound domain , black : percentage of peaks found outside the CENP - A domain . n = 42 fibers from 4 experiments .
