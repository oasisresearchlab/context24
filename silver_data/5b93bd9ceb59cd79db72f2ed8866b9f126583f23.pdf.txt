Due to in - frame deletions in the coding region , PTP - BAS exists in three isoforms : 7 , 455 bp ( 2 , 485 aa ) for type 1 , 7 , 398 bp ( 2 , 466 aa ) for type 2 and 6 , 882 bp ( 2 , 294 aa ) for type 3 . All three isoforms contain a single PTP catalytic domain at the carboxyl termini as well as two distinct structural sequences . Amino terminal sequences of 300 amino acids are homologous to membrane - binding domains of cytoskeleton - associated proteins . Three 90 amino acid internal repetitive sequences are homologous to the GLGF repeats found in guanylate kinase proteins . PTP - BAS was expressed in various human tissues , especially highly in the kidney and lung . Interestingly , the BAS mRNA level in the fetal brain was remarkably high . Key words : Protein - tyrosine phosphatase ; PTP - BAS ; Human basophil ; Molecular cloning ; Membrane - binding domain ; GLGF repeat Introduction The cross - linking of high affinity IgE receptors ( FcsRI ) on basophils and mast cells leads to the immedi - ate release of allergic mediators . Studies using murine cell lines have demonstrated that FcERI - mediated tyro - sine phosphorylation is a major initial signal transducer . Protein - tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) of the Src family ( Lyn , c - Src and c - Yes [ l ] ) and PTK72 [ 2 ] associate with the receptor and become activated after FcERI cross - linking , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins . Such enhanced phosphorylation is diminished immedi - ately when cross - linking is reversed [ 3 , 4 ] . Thus , dephos - phorylation by protein - tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) has also been considered to be important in initial signal transduction via Fc & RI [ 5 ] , but this has not been investi - gated in detail [ 6 , 7 ] . Human basophils and mast cells have not been studied widely , because they are difficult * Corresponding author . Fax : ( 81 ) ( 6 ) 382 2598 .

We have been able to cultivate and differentiate human basophils [ 8 ] . In the present study , we isolated them using a fluorescence - activated cell sorter ( FACS ) . PTPs expressed in the isolated basophils were identified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using degenerative primers . A novel PTP ( named PTP - BAS ) was found . Its full - length cDNA was cloned , sequenced and character - ized . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 .

FACS sorting of basophils Basophil - enriched cells were stained successively with human IgE , F ( ab’ ) Z fragment of mouse anti - human IgE monoclonal antibody and FITC - conjugated anti - mouse IgG . After further staining with propid - ium iodide , the cells were analyzed on a FACStarrLUS flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) . Fluorescence was measured at 530 ( FLl ) and 630 nm ( FL2 ) for FITC and propidium iodide , respectively . Basophils ex - clusively expressing high - affinity IgE receptors in the culture cells , were sorted as the FL1 positive / FL2 negative fraction by FL1 and FL2 gating . 2 . 4 . Oligonucleotide synthesis Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a DNA synthesizer ( CY - CLONE , MilliGen ) . 5’ - Fluorescein - labelled oligonucleotides were syn - thesized as above by means of fluorescein amidite and used as the primer for sequencing on an ALF DNA sequencer ( Pharmacia ) . A pair of degenerate oligonucleotides , A and B , were designed from two highly conserved amino acid sequences within the PTP catalytic domain [ 9 ] . Oligonucleotides A ( sense ) and B ( antisense ) were based on the respec - tive sequences of FWRM ( I or V ) W ( E or Q ) [ S - TT ( C / T ) TGGCGIATG ( G / A ) TITGG ( C / G ) A _ 3’l and HCSAG ( V or I ) G [ S - CC ( G / A ) A ( C / T ) ICCNGCIGA ( A / G ) CA ( A / G ) TG - 31 , where I is inos - ine and N is a mixture of A , C , G and T in oligonucleotide sequences . 201 2 . 5 . PCR 2 . 5 . 1 . Amplification of the PTP catalytic domain Polv ( A ) ’ RNA was isolated from 1 . 6 x lo6 FACS - sorted basouhils _ , 1 using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit , and used as the template to synthesize the first strand cDNA with an oligo ( dT ) 15 primer and SUPERSCRIPT Reverse Transcriptase . Using the resultant first - strand cDNA as the template , the cDNA encoding the conserved PTP catalytic domain was amplified using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase in the presence of a pair of degenerate oligonucleotides , A and B , as the primer . After 25 cycles of amplification ( 94°C 1 min ; SO”C , 1 min ; 72’C , 2 min ) in a DNA Thermal Cycler ( Cetus ) , the PCR product was cloned into the pCR II vector . 2 . 5 . 2 . PCR walking in the 5’ direction The first - strand cDNA template was synthesized using the total RNA isolated from basophil - enriched KU812E cells and sequence - specific oligonucleotide primers . The 5’ unknown regions were ampli - fied by our PCR walking method [ lo ] . 2 . 5 . 3 . Amplification of the 5’ - end sequence of PTP - BAS The extreme 5’ - end sequence of PTP - BAS cDNA was amplified by a combination of a modified 5’ RACE method and our two - step PCR [ lo ] . Briefly , a poly ( dC ) sequence was added to the 3’ - end of the first - strand cDNA described in Section 2 . 5 . 2 using terminal deoxynucleoti - dvl transferase followina the 5’ RACE Svstem instructions . The second - strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligo ( dG ) l5 primer tagged with a unique sequence . Using the resultant double - stranded cDNA as the template , two - step PCR was performed using two pairs of nested prim - ers specific to unique tag and known BAS sequences as described [ lo ] . 2 . 6 . Isolation of PTP - BAS cDNA Total RNA was isolated from about 10’ basophil - enriched KU812E cells by the acid guanidium / phenol / chloroform method 1111 , and poly ( A ) ’ RNA was purified with a mRNA Purification Kit . From 3 pg of poly ( A ) ’ RNA , a KU812E cell cDNA librarv was constructed using the SUPERSCRIPT Lambda System , the AZAP IUEcoRI Cloning Kz and Gigapack II Gold packaging extract . The resultant library con - tained 6 . 3 x lo5 independent recombinants . The PCR fragment of a novel PTP ( named NPTP ) was radiolabeled using [ a - ‘ * PI dCTP and the Ready - To - Go DNA Labeling Kit . The KU812E cDNA library was screened with the radiolabeled NPTP probe at 60°C overnight in 5 x SSC , 5 x Denhardt’s solution , 0 . 5 % SDS containing salmon sperm DNA at lO , @ ml . The filter was washed twice each with 2 x SSC , 0 . 1 % SDS at room temperature for 10 min and with 1 x SSC , 0 . 1 % SDS at 42°C for 15 min . Selected clones were plaque - purified and underwent in vivo excision . 2 . 7 . Sequencing The cloned cDNA fragment was sequenced on an ALF DNA se - quencer ( Pharmacia ) using 5’ - fluorescein - labelled oligonucleotide primers . The sequences cloned by PCR were finalized by sequencing at least three independently amplified clones . PCR fragments amplified in Sections 2 . 52 and 2 . 5 . 3 were directly sequenced with a dsDNA Cycle Sequencing System . Sequencing was done on both strands . 2 . 8 . Northern blot analysis Expression of PTP - BAS in various human tissues was examined using Multiple Tissue Northern Blots ( Human MTN and Human Fetal MTN Blots ) . The BAS cDNA fragment ( BAS - 1 , Fig . 1 ) and a human G3PDH control probe were radiolabeled using the Ready - To - Go DNA Labeling Kit . The blot was hybridized at 42°C for 16 h in 5 x SSPE , 10 x Denhardt’s solution , 50 % formamide , 2 % SDS containing salmon sperm DNA at 100 @ ml . The blot was washed twice with 2 x SSC , 0 . 05 % SDS at room temperature , twice with 1 x SSC , 0 . 1 % SDS at 50°C then twice with 0 . 1 x SSC , 0 . 1 % SDS at 5O’C for 20 min each before exposure to a Kodak XAR - film at - 80°C with an intensifying screen . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Identzjication of a novel PTP To identify PTPs expressed in human basophils , se - quences in the PTP catalytic domain were amplified by PCR using the first - strand cDNA from FACS - sorted basophils as the template . A pair of degenerate primers ( A and B ) corresponding to the sequences that are highly conserved but which flank a region of variable sequences was used . The predicted PCR product was cloned into the pCR II vector and a total of 33 clones was sequenced . Among these , 27 were known PTPs , including LCA [ 12 , 13 ] , MEG [ 14 ] , MEG2 [ 15 ] and TCPTP [ 16 ] . The remaining six clones were identical and differed from the known PTPs . This PCR - amplified cDNA fragment was designated as NPTP ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . 2 . 5 x lo5 recombi - nants out of a cDNA library from basophil - enriched KU812E cells was screened with the radiolabeled NPTP probe . Two positive clones were isolated and sequenced ( BAS - 1 in Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Four consensus polyadenyla - tion signals ( AATAAA ) were found upstream from the poly ( A ) tail , but an in - frame stop codon preceding the initial methionine codon was not included , indicating that the coding region of BAS - 1 extends further in the 5’ direction . To synthesize the first - strand cDNA containing the most 5’ sequence of PTP - BAS , a sequence - specific oli - gonucleotide overlapping the S - end of BAS - 1 was used as the primer . By using the resultant first - strand cDNA as the template , the 5’ unknown sequence was specifically amplified by our PCR walking method [ lo ] . Through six consecutive PCR walks , sequence of about 3 kilobases ( kb ) upstream from the S - end of BAS - 1 was obtained . The S - end sequence of the PTP - BAS cDNA was ampli - fied by our improved S’RACE method ( BAS - 5 in Fig . 1 ) and overlapped with the sixth walking sequence . To ver - ify the sequence obtained by the S’PCR walking and S’RACE methods , overlapping cDNA fragments ( BAS - 2 , - 3 and - 4 in Fig . 1 ) were amplified using sequence - specific primers , cloned into pCR II vectors and se - quenced . Two in - frame deletions were found in the BAS - 202 K . Maekawa et al . IFEBS Letters 337 ( 1994 ) 200 - 206 0 2 4 6 8 kb ftwel - BAS - 4 I BAS - 50 Fig . 1 .

The composite full - length nucleotide sequence desig - nated PTP - BAS type 1 contains a consensus initiation codon ( AATATGC ) [ 17 ] at position 64 and is preceded by an in - frame stop codon ( Fig . 2 ) . The initiation codon is followed by a single open reading frame of 7 , 455 bp encoding 2 , 485 amino acids . Types 2 and 3 lack respec - tively , nucleotides 3 , 229 - 3285 ( amino acids 1 , 0561 , 074 ) and nucleotides 2 , 713 - 3 , 285 ( amino acids 8841 , 074 ) in type 1 ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . The open reading frames for types 2 and 3 are 7 , 398 bp ( 2 , 466 residues ) and 6 , 882 bp ( 2 , 294 residues ) , respectively . All three isoforms of PTP - BAS contain a single PTP catalytic domain at their carboxyl termini ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) , where the cysteine ( amino acid 2 , 408 for type 1 ) essential to catalysis [ 18 ] and 98 % of 42 consensus residues common to 12 representative PTPs [ 9 ] are present ( Fig . 3 ) . 3 . 2 . Sequence similarities A homology search for the amino terminal region of the PTP catalytic domain was conducted using the Gen - Bank data base ( release 78 ) with the FASTA program . Strong similarity ( 25 - 30 % identity and 4650 % similar - ity ) was revealed between amino acids 574 - 881 of PTP - BAS and the amino terminal sequences of cytoskeleton - associated proteins ( protein 4 . 1 , ezrin , radixin and moesin of human and other species ) and two cytosolic PTPs ( PTPHl and PTP - MEG ) ( Figs . 4 and 6 ) . Three GLGF repeats reported in the rat brain postsynaptic density protein ( PSD - 95 ) [ 19 ] as a homologue of the Drosophila lethal ( l ) discs - large - l tumor suppressor pro - tein ( dls ) [ 20 ] were found in the central part of PTP - BAS ( amino acids 1 , 0941 , 178 , 1 , 368 - 1 , 452 and 1 , 501 - 1 , 588 for type 1 ) ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) .

Compared with the adult , the expression in human fetal ( 20 - 26 weeks ) tis - sues was remarkably enhanced in the brain , but was similar in the kidney , lung , heart and liver ( Fig . 7B ) . 4 . Discussion A novel PTP was identified from human basophils by PCR using degenerate primers deduced from conserved amino acid sequences in the PTP catalytic domain . A cDNA fragment of 4 , 663 bp ( BAS - 1 in Figs . 1 and 2 ) was cloned from a KU812E cDNA library . The 5’ unknown region was amplified and sequenced by our modified 5’ PCR walking and 5’ RACE methods . The composite full - length cDNA contains consensus polyadenylation signals with a poly ( A ) tail and a consensus initiation sequence of Kozak [ 17 ] preceded by an in - frame stop codon ( Fig . 2 ) . The coding region contains two distinct in - frame deletions , suggesting that three isoforms ( types l - 3 ) are expressed ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . The estimated full - length cDNAs ( 8 , 139 , 8 , 082 and 7 , 566 bp for types 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively ) correspond roughly to the size of the mRNA detected by Northern blotting ( arrowed in Fig . 7 ) , although the size differences were too small to be distinguished in the corresponding bands . A single PTP catalytic domain is present at the carboxyl termini of all isoforms , that contains all but one of 42 conserved resi - dues in known PTPs [ 9 ] including the catalytically essen - tial cysteine residue [ 18 ] at 2 , 408 for type 1 ( Fig . 3 ) . This novel PTP is named PTP - BAS ( after basophils ) . A hy - dropathy plot of the deduced amino acid sequences showed no hydrophobic regions that resemble a signal sequence or transmembrane domain ( data not shown ) , and thus all isoforms of PTP - BAS are likely to be cyto - plasmic proteins . PTP - BAS is a cytosolic PTP of the largest molecule reported to date : 2 , 485 amino acid resi - dues for type 1 , 2 , 466 residues for type 2 and 2 , 294 residues for type 3 ( Fig . 2 ) . The existence in three isoforms may be of some functional importance . A homology search for the amino terminal region of the catalytic domain revealed that all isoforms contain two distinct structural sequences ( Fig . 1 ) . Amino acids 571 - 881 of all the isoforms are highly similar to the amino terminal sequences of cytoskeleton - associated proteins : similar to the ezrin - radixin - moesin family [ 21 ] ( 27 - 29 % identity and 50 % similarity , Fig . 4 ) and some - what less similar to protein 4 . 1 [ 22 ] ( 25 % identity and lr / / / / 717fl PTPHI p PTP - MEG m _ Moesin y / / I - / / / fl Radixin B Ezrin y / / / 7 / / / 1 Protein 4 . 1 I v / / , / / / / 1 IA - 4 NVIFVU c1 BAS ( type 1 ) . . a PSD - 95 . . . .

Protein 4 . 1 binds to the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane proteins glycophorin [ 23 ] and band 3 [ 24 ] via the amino terminal domain [ 25 ] . Thus , the corre - sponding amino terminal region is called a membrane - binding domain [ 22 ] . Amino terminal domains of the ezrin - radixin - moesin family are homologous to the mem - brane - binding domain , so they are likely to bind to the plasma membrane [ 21 , 26 ] . The cytosolic PTPs contain - ing the membrane - binding domain reported so far are PTP - MEG [ 14 ] and PTPHl [ 27 ] ( Fig . 6 ) . PTP - BAS con - tains the other characteristic sequences : three 90 amino acid internal repeat sequences homologous to the GLGF repeats reported in guanylate kinase proteins : the rat brain PSD - 95 protein [ 19 ] and the Drosophila dZg protein [ 20 ] ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . These repeats are presumed to play a structural role in targeting the proteins to the submem - branous cytoskeleton or a functional role of regulating the enzyme activity [ 19 ] . PTP - BAS is thus a novel cy - tosolic PTP , supposedly attached to the plasma mem - brane via the amino terminal membrane - binding domain and its substrate - specificity or PTP activity is regulated via the central GLGF repeats . PTP - BAS initially cloned from human basophils was expressed in various human tissues , especially at the highest in the kidney and high in the lung . Interestingly , PTP - BAS was expressed at a remarkably high level in fetal , but weakly in the adult brain ( Fig . 7 ) . Furthermore , the PTP - BAS mRNA level increased with the growth and differentiation of human basophils cultured from cord blood mononuclear cells [ lo ] ( data not shown ) . Thus , PTP - BAS may play a role in intracellular signal transduction and may be relevant to cell growth and 205 differentiation . The functional significance of this novel PTP is now under investigation . Acknowledgements : We are grateful to Dr .
