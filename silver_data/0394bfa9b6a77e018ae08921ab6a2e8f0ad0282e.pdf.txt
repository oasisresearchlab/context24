The pathogenesis of these organisms in humans is limited by their inability to grow above 35°C . M . marinum causes systemic disease in ﬁsh but produces localized skin infections in humans . M . ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer , a severe human skin lesion . At the molecular level , M . ulcerans is distinguished from M . marinum by the presence of a virulence plasmid which encodes a macrolide toxin , mycolactone , as well as by hundreds of insertion sequences , particularly IS 2404 . There has been a global increase in reports of ﬁsh mycobacteriosis . An unusual clade of M . marinum has been reported from ﬁsh in the Red and Mediterranean Seas and a new mycobacterial species , Mycobacterium pseudoshottsii , has been cultured from ﬁsh in the Chesapeake Bay , United States . We have discovered that both groups of ﬁsh pathogens produce a unique mycolactone toxin , mycolactone F . Mycolactone F is the smallest mycolactone ( molecular weight , 700 ) yet identiﬁed . The core lactone structure of mycolactone F is identical to that of M . ulcerans mycolactones , but a unique side chain structure is present . Mycolactone F produces apoptosis and necrosis on cultured cells but is less potent than M . ulcerans mycolactones . Both groups of ﬁsh pathogens contain IS 2404 . In contrast to M . ulcerans and conventional M . marinum , mycolactone F - producing mycobacteria are incapable of growth at above 30°C . This fact is likely to limit their virulence for humans . However , such isolates may provide a reservoir for horizontal transfer of the mycolactone plasmid in aquatic environments . Mycobacterium marinum is a globally distributed pathogen of marine and freshwater ﬁsh which also causes skin infections in humans ( 7 , 9 ) . M . marinum is phenotypically distinguished from other mycobacteria by its low optimal growth tempera - ture , light - induced carotenoid production , and relatively rapid growth rate compared to other slow - growing Mycobacterium species . There is considerable heterogeneity among M . mari - num isolates , and several subgroups have been described ( 28 , 33 – 35 ) . Mycobacteriosis was ﬁrst diagnosed in ﬁsh from the Red Sea in 1990 ( 5 ) . The infection was initially found in cultured sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) in Eilat and has since been found in over 20 different ﬁsh species and a hawksbill sea turtle . The Red Sea isolates differed phenotypically from other M . mari - num strains by being scotochromogenic ( having constitutive pigment production ) . Whereas most M . marinum strains form colonies on mycobacterial media within 8 days , initial growth was not obtained from these isolates for at least 2 weeks . Similar isolates have also been found in the Mediterranean Sea in Greece and Italy . Molecular characterization of the Israeli isolates from ﬁsh conﬁrmed their identity as M . marinum , but analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that the isolates formed clades within the species ( 33 , 34 ) . Molecular comparison of the ﬁsh isolates with human isolates of M . marinum from Israel showed that human and ﬁsh isolates fell into discrete groups based on 16S rRNA , hsp65 , and AFLP patterns ( 34 ) . Human isolates were designated A strains , whereas ﬁsh isolates were placed in the B group . Within group B , marine isolates ( B1 ) could be distinguished from freshwater isolates ( B2 ) . A grow - ing number of similar M . marinum strains have been isolated from marine ﬁsh in various locations along the Mediterranean coast ( Italy , Israel , and Greece ) as well as from ﬁsh from other aquatic environments in Israel . The Red Sea M . marinum strain is the only mycobacterial species detected in the marine environment in Israel and is associated with unusually severe pathology . Though cutaneous lesions are not always present , the spleens and kidneys of diseased ﬁsh are riddled with granulomas containing massive numbers of acid - fast bacilli ( Fig . 1 ) . The Israeli marine strain was ﬁrst isolated from cultured sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) , but many Red Sea species appear to be susceptible to infection ( 5 , 8 , 33 ) . Newly emerging mycobacterial ﬁsh pathogens from the Chesapeake Bay in the United States have also been reported ( 15 , 25 ) . In 2005 a new mycobacterial species , Mycobacterium pseudoshottsii , was described in association with epizootic ﬁsh disease among striped bass ( Morone saxatilis ) in the Chesa - peake Bay , Maryland . Molecular analysis showed that the 16S rRNA gene from M . pseudoshottsii was greater than 99 % sim - ilar to that of an Israeli marine M . marinum isolate , DL240490 * Corresponding author .

M . pseudoshottsii was reported to be closely related to M . marinum , to the human pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans , and to a newly described frog pathogen , Mycobacterium liﬂandii ( 24 ) . It was of particular interest that M . pseudoshottsii , like M . liﬂandii , contained an insertion sequence , IS 2404 , previously found only in M . ulcerans and in an atypical M . marinum strain isolated from a human patient ( 25 , 30 ) . DNA - DNA hybridization and multilocus sequence analysis show that M . marinum is extremely closely related to M . ulcer - ans ( 28 , 31 ) . The two species share 99 . 8 % identity within the 16S rRNA gene , and a growing body of evidence suggests that M . ulcerans evolved relatively recently from an M . marinum ancestor ( 29 ) . Two major events have been associated with the evolution of M . ulcerans . One is acquisition of a plasmid - en - coded macrolide toxin , mycolactone , and the second is major genome remodeling associated with insertion of over 300 cop - ies of two insertion sequences , IS 2404 and IS 2606 . Acquisition of these IS elements has created a large number of pseudo - genes in M . ulcerans , leading to the hypothesis that M . ulcerans is adapting to a specialized niche ( http : / / genopole . pasteur . fr / Mulc / BuruList . html ) . Despite the close taxonomic relationship , M . marinum and M . ulcerans produce distinctly different diseases ( 7 , 9 ) . Whereas M . marinum causes a granulomatous intracellular infection in ﬁsh and humans , M . ulcerans produces an extracellular infection , Buruli ulcer , characterized by severe tissue destruction and the presence of few inﬂammatory cells at the site of infection ( 2 , 6 , 20 , 36 ) . Genetic evidence with mycolactone - negative mutants suggests that mycolactone is responsible for the unique char - acteristics of Buruli ulcer ( 1 , 12 ) . Recently a second mycolac - tone - producing mycobacterial pathogen , M . liﬂandii , was iso - lated from Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus laevis frogs in U . S . laboratories ( 24 , 32 ) . This organism is also closely related to M . marinum and M . ulcerans . Mycolactone is a hybrid polyketide composed of a lactone core and a fatty acid side chain ( 14 ) . All strains of M . ulcerans produce a major mycolactone species along with several minor congeners ( 4 , 16 , 23 ) . The ﬁrst mycolactones were isolated from a Malaysian isolate of M . ulcerans as a 3 : 2 mixture of two stereoismers designated mycolactone A / B ( 14 ) . Since then it has been shown that all African and Malaysian isolates of M . ulcerans produce identical molecules . However , there is hetero - geneity in the mycolactones produced by M . ulcerans from different geographic areas . M . ulcerans strains isolated in Aus - tralia produce a different mycolactone , mycolactone C , whereas Asian isolates of M . ulcerans produce primarily my - colactone D ( 23 ) . A novel plasmid - encoded mycolactone , my - colactone E , has been recently identiﬁed in the frog pathogen M . liﬂandii ( 23 ) . The large polyketide synthase genes for my - colactone biosynthesis comprise a 110 - kb gene cluster on a large ( 154 - to 180 - kb ) plasmid ( 29 ) . The lactone core structure , encoded by mlsA , is conserved in all mycolactones . Molecular diversity has arisen through modiﬁcations of the fatty acid side chain structure encoded by mlsB . Despite the structural heterogeneity , all mycolactone species produce apoptosis and necrosis in cultured cells ( 1 , 13 , 26 ) . Mycolactone A / B is the only mycolactone evaluated in vivo . In guinea pig and mouse infection models as well as in human infection , mycolactone A / B causes apoptotic cell death as well as death via necrosis ( 1 ) . In addition , in humans and guinea pigs , mycolactone is associated with immunosuppression ( 36 , 37 ) . The close taxonomic relationship of an Israeli M . marinum isolate ( DL240490 ) to M . pseudoshottsii , the relationship of these species to M . ulcerans , and the shared association with aquatic environments led us to investigate further the relation - ship of M . pseudoshottsii and Israeli ﬁsh isolates to M . ulcerans . Results from these studies show that M . marinum strains iso - lated from ﬁsh in several locations in the Mediterranean and Red Seas as well as M . pseudoshottsii strains isolated from ﬁsh in the Chesapeake Bay produce a plasmid - encoded mycolac - tone . Despite the wide geographic separation of mycolactone - producing M . marinum and M . pseudoshottsii , both groups of organisms produce an identical mycolactone , designated my - colactone F . MATERIALS AND METHODS Histology . Fish were trapped , euthanatized , and dissected within 48 h . Dis - sected tissue was ﬁxed with buffered neutral formalin , dehydrated in ethanol , and embedded in parafﬁn . Parafﬁn blocks were sectioned and stained with Ziehl - Neelsen stain as described previously ( 8 ) . Strains and growth conditions . Strains and their sources are shown in Table 1 . All isolates were grown on Middlebrook 7H10 agar medium supplemented with 10 % oleic acid , dextrose , and albumin supplement or on Bordet - Gengou me - dium . M . ulcerans strains were incubated at 32°C . All other isolates were grown at room temperature ( RT ) . For determination of optimal growth temperature , mycobacterial isolates were grown at 32°C and RT ( 23 to 25°C ) . For determi - nation of pigment production , isolates were grown initially in the dark and exposed to light for 2 h . Plates were subsequently returned to the dark to prevent degradation of mycolactones . Mycolactone isolation . Lipids were extracted from M . ulcerans with chloro - form - methanol ( 2 : 1 , vol / vol ) , and phospholipids were removed by precipitation with ice - cold acetone to obtain acetone - soluble lipids ( ASLs ) . Puriﬁed mycolac - tone was obtained using centripetal silica chromatography with a chromatotron as previously described ( 11 , 24 ) . ASLs were analyzed by thin - layer silica chro - matography using the solvent system chloroform - methanol - water ( 90 : 10 : 1 , vol / vol / vol ) and visualized by charring with ceric sulfate - ammonium molybdate in 2 M sulfuric acid ( 24 ) . Cell culture and cytopathicity assays . L929 mouse ﬁbroblasts ( ATCC CCL1 ) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in the lab in Dulbecco’s minimal Eagle medium with 5 % fetal calf serum and 1 (cid:2) L - glutamine in tissue culture ﬂasks incubated in 5 % CO 2 at 37°C as previously described ( 1 ) . ASL samples or individual lipid species were diluted in tissue culture medium and added to cells in a 96 - well tissue culture plate to determine cytopathicity . In addition , intact bacteria and culture ﬁltrate were directly added to cells in serial dilutions to evaluate the cytopathic capacity of surface - exposed and secreted mycolactone . Cytopathicity was deﬁned as the minimal concentra - tion of ASL or mycolactone necessary to produce cell rounding in 24 h and loss of the monolayer by 48 h ( 1 , 11 ) . PCR .

DNA sequencing . PCR products were cloned into the pCR2 . 1 - Topo vector ( Invitrogen ) and sequenced using an ABI 3100 automated genetic analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , Inc . ) and the ABI Big Dye Terminator 3 . 1 cycle sequencing kit ( Applied Biosystems , Inc . ) . LDH release and apoptosis . L929 ﬁbroblasts and peripheral blood neutrophils were assayed for cell death via apoptosis and necrosis . Cytotoxicity / necrosis was measured using a colorimetric kit from Promega as described previously ( 1 ) . Brieﬂy , cells suspended in Dulbecco’s minimal Eagle medium supplemented with 5 % ( ﬁbroblasts ) or 10 % ( neutrophils ) fetal calf serum and 1 (cid:2) L - glutamine were seeded in triplicate at a concentration of 10 4 cells / well in a 96 - well plate . The release of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) from mycolactone - treated ( 15 ng , 150 ng , 1 . 5 (cid:3) g , and 15 (cid:3) g ) , permeabilized cells was measured at 24 h postinfection by using the colorimetric kit from Promega according to the man - ufacturer’s instructions . Background release of LDH was obtained by measure - ment of ethanol - treated cells , and maximum release of LDH was obtained by lysis of untreated cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The percent LDH release was then determined using the following calculation : [ ( release of LDH from mycolactone - treated cells (cid:5) background release from ethanol - treated cells ) / ( maxi - mum release of LDH by cell lysis (cid:5) background release ) ] (cid:2) 100 . Apoptosis of mycolactone - treated neutrophils and ﬁbroblasts was measured at 24 h posttreatment by using the Cell Death Detection Plus enzyme - linked im - munosorbent assay ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) as described previously ( 1 ) . Apop - tosis was then determined as fold enrichment of nucleosomes [ ( measurement of DNA - histone complex from treated cells / background measurement of untreated cells ) ] . HPLC and MS . Methanolic extracts of ASLs were analyzed using Shimadzu LC - 20AD analytical high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with UV de - tection at 360 nm . Separation of various mycolactones was obtained on a Phe - nomenex - Luna C 18 250 - by 4 . 6 - mm column at a ﬂow rate of 2 ml / min with a water - acetonitrile gradient ( 55 % acetonitrile for 3 min [ isocratic ] followed by a 37 - min linear gradient to100 % acetonitrile ) . UV - active fractions were analyzed ofﬂine on an ion trap ESI Bruker - Esquire mass spectrometer ( MS ) . MS analysis conditions were as follows : dry temperature of 300°C , gas ﬂow of 5 liters / min , and nebulizer pressure of 15 lb / in 2 . For preliminary screening , the methanolic ex - tracts of ASLs were directly analyzed without chromatographic separation . NMR . Two milligrams of previously puriﬁed mycolactone F was dissolved in CD 3 COCD 3 ( 500 (cid:3) l ) . 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) and two - dimen - sional ( 2D ) spectroscopy ( COSY ) spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 500 MHz . Chemical shifts were reported in ppm relative to the residual acetone peak at 2 . 09 ppm . Nucleotide sequence accession numbers .

The fact that M . marinum and M . ul - cerans grow poorly , if at all , above 35°C is thought to limit infection in humans primarily to cutaneous lesions . In hospital laboratories M . ulcerans and M . marinum are grown at 30 to 32°C . Furthermore , M . marinum strains isolated from ﬁsh as well as from humans have been shown to grow readily at 30°C ( 9 , 35 ) . In marine veterinary laboratories , however , including that at Eilat , mycobacteria from ﬁsh are routinely grown at 23 to 25°C . Also , the ﬁsh pathogen M . pseudoshottsii has been reported to be unable to grow at 30°C ( 25 ) . Since the temper - ature sensitivity of M . marinum isolated from ﬁsh in Israel had not been reported , we investigated the ability of these strains to grow above 25°C . M . ulcerans , M . marinum 1218 , M . mari - num DL / DK1 , and M . marinum M grew readily at 32°C , a temperature consistent with the growth temperature used in clinical laboratories . The frog pathogen M . liﬂandii also grew at 32°C on M7H10 with oleic acid - albumin - dextrose complex . However , M . marinum isolated from ﬁsh from the Red and Mediterranean Seas showed more severe temperature - re - stricted growth . For these isolates , no growth was observed after 3 months of incubation at 32°C . The two freshwater isolates from Israel , CC240299 and BB170200 , produced very scant growth at 32°C , suggesting that the growth temperature ranges of these two isolates may be broader than those of the Red Sea isolates . None of the ﬁve M . pseudoshottsii isolates tested produced growth at 32°C . The generation time of M . marinum is reported to be 4 . 5 h , and colonies can be detected on solid medium within 7 to 10 days . M . marinum 1218 ( ﬁsh , United States ) , M . marinum DL / DK1 ( ﬁsh , Denmark ) , and M . marinum M ( human , United States ) formed colonies by 8 days at 32°C . However , M . mari - num isolates from the Red and Mediterranean Seas did not produce colonies for at least 14 days at RT . M . ulcerans , M . liﬂandii , and M . pseudoshottsii required 4 weeks of incubation at their optimal temperatures ( 32°C , 32°C , and 23 to 25°C , respectively ) . Pigment production in Israeli isolates is variable among strains and is constitutive . Most M . marinum strains produce large quantities of carotenoid pigments upon exposure to light . Pigment production was variable among Israeli and other Mediterranean strains tested . All of the 11 saltwater isolates tested were deep yellow , consistent with carotenoid produc - tion . However , pigment production occurred constitutively without light induction ( i . e . , these strains were scotochromo - genic ) . Colonies from freshwater isolates CC240299 and BB170200 and two isolates from Italy , DL300 / 04 and DL272 / 05 , were very pale yellow . Analysis of chloroform - methanol extracts by thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) revealed the presence of a major lipid species with a retention factor ( R f ) of 0 . 71 in all strains which produced a deep - yellow pigment con - sistent with carotenoid production ( data not shown ) . PCR analysis of M . marinum and M . pseudoshottsii for the presence of mycolactone - and M . ulcerans - speciﬁc genes . All Israeli and Mediterranean Sea isolates of M . marinum as well as M . pseudoshottsii were positive for all mycolactone - associ - ated genes except MUP053 , suggesting that mycolactones from these strains would not have a hydroxyl at C - 12 on the fatty acid side chain . DNA sequence comparisons of mlsA , mlsB , and MUP045 from mycolactone - producing M . marinum ( MPMM ) and M . pseudoshottsii with those from M . ulcerans revealed greater than 99 % homology for all three genes . In contrast , these sequences could not be ampliﬁed from two M . marinum ﬁsh isolates , DL / DK1 ( Europe ) and 1218 ( United States ) or from the genome sequence strain for M . marinum ( strain M ) . M . marinum isolates obtained from human patients in Israel ( 34 ) were PCR negative for all mycolactone - related genes . The availability of the M . ulcerans and M . marinum genome sequence made it possible to further characterize MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii isolates with respect to M . ulcerans - and M . marinum - speciﬁc genes ( T . P . Stinear et al . , unpublished data ) . A number of M . ulcerans genes , including the insertion se - quences IS 2404 and IS 2606 as well as a few chromosomally encoded loci , are present in the M . ulcerans genome strain , Agy99 , but absent in the M . marinum genome strain , strain M . A further distinction between M . ulcerans and M . marinum is that most M . ulcerans strains have undergone a 2 . 8 - kb deletion in RD1 ( 24 ) , a region ﬁrst deﬁned in Mycobacterium tubercu - losis ( 17 , 21 ) which encodes a putative secretion apparatus required for secretion of the small antigenic proteins Esat6 ( esxA ) and Cfp10 ( esxB ) . Esat6 and Cfp10 play an important role in the granulomatous response to M . marinum and M . tuberculosis , and the absence of these genes in most M . ulcerans strains may contribute to the diminished granulomatous re - sponse to M . ulcerans infections . IS 2404 was detected in all MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii isolates tested and was absent from the M . marinum 1218 and M . marinum DL / DK1 isolates as well as the M strain . In con - trast , IS 2606 was not detected in the two MPMM isolates , CC240299 and BB170200 , obtained from freshwater ﬁsh but was detected in all marine MPMM isolates . The majority of “ M . ulcerans - speciﬁc” genes were detected in MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii isolates as well as in M . liﬂandii ( Table 2 ) . How - ever , an M . ulcerans - speciﬁc hypothetical membrane protein gene , uhp - mem , was lacking in all isolates of MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii , and uhp - 2 , an M . ulcerans - speciﬁc phage se - quence , was absent from M . liﬂandii and MPMM CC240299 and BB170200 . Finally , esxA and esxB were present in MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii . The presence of esxA and esxB in MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii might provide insight into the evolution - ary relationship between these isolates and M . ulcerans . MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii produce a unique mycolac - tone . ASLs from 2 : 1 chloroform - methanol extracts of bacterial pellets were analyzed by silica thin - layer chromatography for the presence of polar lipid species typical of mycolactones . In a chloroform - methanol - water ( 90 : 10 : 1 , vol / vol / vol ) solvent sys - tem , M . ulcerans mycolactone A / B has an R f of 0 . 29 , whereas M . liﬂandii mycolactone E has an R f of 0 . 53 . Silica TLC analysis of lipids from 6 M . pseudoshottsii isolates and 15 MPMM iso - lates showed that ASLs from all strains contained a putative mycolactone species with an R f of 0 . 43 ( data not shown ) . Cy - topathicity assays using L929 cells showed that this lipid spe - cies caused cell rounding after 24 h and detachment at 48 h at a concentration of less than 100 ng / ml , a phenotype consistent with mycolactone activity . Cytopathicity was associated with this lipid species in each strain tested . Addition of approxi - mately 10 4 intact bacteria also produced this cytopathic effect , 6040 RANGER ET AL . I NFECT .

Finally , addition of sterile culture ﬁltrate elicited cytopathicity , suggesting that this molecule was secreted as well as cell associated . Identiﬁcation of mycolactone F . Since all M . pseudoshottsii isolates were phenotypically very similar , showed identical lipid proﬁles by TLC , and were identical by PCR proﬁling , only L15 , the type strain for M . pseudoshottsii , was grown in quantity to obtain sufﬁcient mycolactone for detailed chemical analysis . However , both phenotypic heterogeneity and molecular hetero - geneity were detected within MPMM isolates . For this reason mycolactones were puriﬁed from nine of them , representing each of the major groups of isolates characterized by Ucko and Colorni ( 34 ) . Previously identiﬁed mycolactones and cometabolites share a conserved core structure , with variation only in the substitu - tion of the side chain . Therefore , mass spectroscopy analysis of ASLs has been a very useful tool in screening for new myco - lactones . Mass spectroscopic analysis of M . pseudoshottsii L15 and the nine isolates of MPMM revealed a major ion at m / z 723 ( M (cid:1) Na ) , suggesting the presence of a novel mycolactone , which was designated mycolactone F ( Table 3 ) . The cytopathic activity of this species for L929 cells was 10 ng / ml . This ion was absent from M . marinum DL / DK1 . Using ion trap MS / MS analysis , the conserved lactone core can be detected as an M (cid:1) Na ion at m / z 429 that is produced upon fragmentation of the parent mycolactone . Using this technique , we found that ASLs of all of the MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii strains tested showed a major positive ion at m / z 723 ( M (cid:1) Na ) which upon fragmentation produced the conserved core fragment ion at m / z 429 . Moreover , the fragmentation patterns in all samples were identical , suggesting that the mycolactones produced by these strains have the same chemical structure ( Fig . 2 ) . Deu - terium exchange experiments concluded that mycolactone F has only four hydroxyl groups , two of which are located in the side chain . This is consistent with PCR data suggesting the absence of MUP053 , which is thought to produce a third hydroxyl group on carbon 12 of the side chain of mycolactone A / B . Most mycolactones exist as a mixture of double - bond iso - mers and are isolated along with minor cometabolites . To investigate this issue , reversed - phase HPLC analysis was per - formed on the ASL extracts . Under the condition described , the major isomer of mycolactone F was easily identiﬁable at a TABLE 2 .

Other geometric isomers and minor cometabolites were also identiﬁed . HPLC and MS / MS analysis conﬁrmed that all strains produce the same molecule . However , differences in stereochemistry , though unlikely , cannot be ruled out by these methods . Structural characterization of mycolactone F . Although mass spectroscopy is an increasingly valuable tool for molecu - lar analysis , data from NMR analysis provides a more rigorous method for structural assignments . The limited amount of my - colactone produced by mycobacterial species as well as the very low growth rate of mycolactone - producing bacteria has made it extremely difﬁcult to obtain sufﬁcient mycolactone for optimal structural analysis . However , the relatively robust growth yield of lipids from some MPMM isolates made it possible to undertake a more thorough analysis of the myco - lactone F structure . For these studies , 1D and 2D NMR ex - periments were performed on puriﬁed mycolactone from M . marinum DL240490 . 1 H NMR revealed a structure very similar to that reported for mycolactone A / B , with the characteristic core signals of protons at C - 9 , C - 15 , C - 11 , and C - 5 easily identiﬁed at 5 . 16 , 5 . 03 , 4 . 93 , and 4 . 75 ppm , respectively ( Fig . 4 ; Table 4 ) . In the region corresponding to the side chain , two geometric isomers were distinguished , with an integration ratio of 10 to 1 . Both isomers showed ﬁve oleﬁnic protons . For the major isomer , the most downﬁeld proton was that of C - 3 (cid:4) which appeared as a doublet at 7 . 39 ppm and was coupled to the C - 2 (cid:4) proton ( doublet at 5 . 91 ppm ) . The presence of two singlet peaks at 6 . 4 and 6 . 1 ppm suggested methyl substitutions at C - 4 (cid:4) , C - 6 (cid:4) , and C - 8 (cid:4) . This was conﬁrmed by 2D COSY analysis , which showed the long - range coupling of these ole - FIG . 2 . Mass spectroscopy of ASLs from mycolactone F - producing M . marinum strains .

The remain - ing side chain signals from C - 10 (cid:4) to C - 15 (cid:4) overlapped signals from the mycolactone core in the 1D 1 H NMR . Thus , 2D COSY was used to assign these protons ( C - 9 (cid:4) to C - 14 (cid:4) ) , using the off - diag - onal 1 H - 1 H correlation peaks . Mycolactone F ( Fig . 5 ) is the small - est mycolactone so far identiﬁed . As with other mycolactone variants , the core lactone structure is identical to that of other mycolactones , whereas the side chain is unique . Biological activities of mycolactone F . Mycolactones pro - duce a distinct phenotype on cultured cells , characterized by necrosis at concentrations of above 1 (cid:3) g / ml withi n 4 h and delayed apoptosis at concentrations as low as 1 ng / ml within 24 h ( 1 ) . In order to determine the activity of mycolactone F on cultured cells , puriﬁed mycolactone was added to a semicon - ﬂuent layer of L929 ﬁbroblasts and tested for the ability to produce necrosis or apoptosis . Although mycolactone F showed typical mycolactone phenotypes , the potency of mycolactone F with regard to apoptosis was signiﬁcantly less than that of mycolactone A / B ( Fig . 6 ) . DISCUSSION For 25 years , M . ulcerans had the distinction of being the only mycobacterial pathogen to produce a secreted toxin . The ﬁnding that mycolactone is plasmid encoded led to the hypoth - esis that other mycolactone - producing mycobacteria might ex - ist , particularly in aquatic environments . Results from this in - vestigation show that mycolactone - producing Mycobacterium species are widely distributed within aquatic environments . It is signiﬁcant that all mycolactone - producing mycobacteria have been identiﬁed as pathogens . Although the ecology of M . ulcerans is poorly understood , the only well - deﬁned risk factor for infection is association with slow - moving water ( 2 , 3 , 6 , 35 ) . Of particular interest is the fact that human disease caused by M . ulcerans , frog disease caused by M . liﬂandii , and ﬁsh disease caused by MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii have been associated with deteriorating water quality and / or eutrophic enrichment ( 2 , 8 , 24 , 32 ) . This sug - gests that similar water quality parameters in different parts of the world may play a role in the ecology of mycolactone - producing bacteria . The geographic heterogeneity of mycolac - tone structure , along with highly conserved structure within a speciﬁc region , has led to the hypothesis that there is strong selection within a speciﬁc environment for a particular myco - lactone . The discovery of mycolactone F in two mycobacterial species isolated from ﬁsh in widely separated geographic areas suggests that mycolactone F plays a particular role in ﬁsh disease . Fish may in fact act as “indicator species” in these environments . Mycolactones are synthesized by large type 1 polyketide synthases . There is a remarkable amount of repeated DNA sequence within the mycolactone pks genes , which provides the opportunity for formation of new mycolactones through re - combination ( 29 ) . However , the core lactone structure in my - colactone F is identical to that in mycolactones from M . ulcer - ans and M . liﬂandii . Mycolactone F is the smallest mycolactone identiﬁed so far , and it varies from other mycolactones in side chain structure . Our results suggest that side chain structure plays an important role in potency , since the ability of myco - lactone F to cause apoptosis is signiﬁcantly less than that of other mycolactones . In the past ﬁve years there has been an intense search for M . ulcerans in the environment . Those stud - ies have relied solely on detection of IS 2404 as evidence for M . ulcerans , based on a report showing that IS 2404 was absent from 48 species of mycobacteria obtained from a laboratory collection ( 27 ) . IS 2404 PCR has been used to demonstrate the presence of M . ulcerans DNA in ﬁsh ( 10 ) , frogs , many species of insects , snails , and a large range of aquatic samples from Africa ( 19 , 22 ) . The presence of IS 2404 in MPMM , along with its presence in M . liﬂandii and M . pseudoshottsii , provides a clear signal that IS 2404 PCR cannot be used as the sole evi - FIG . 5 .

Nonetheless , IS 2404 may be a useful marker for the mycolactone plasmid . There is considerable heterogeneity within M . marinum spe - cies ( 31 , 35 ) . In the past few years investigators have suggested that M . marinum isolates from humans are genetically different than isolates from poikilothermic species . Stinear et al . ( 28 ) examined 22 M . marinum isolates ( 19 from humans and 3 from ﬁsh ) and used multilocus sequence analysis to separate them into ﬁve categories . Based on an examination of 11 human isolates and 6 ﬁsh isolates , Van der Sar et al . ( 35 ) suggested that the human isolates were more pathogenic in zebra ﬁsh and better able to grow in the human macrophage THP - 1 cell line than isolates from poikilothermic species such as ﬁsh . The majority of these strains were from collections , and the country of origin was not provided , making it impossible to compare isolates within a geographic region . The best data for the association of speciﬁc M . marinum genotypes with human or nonhuman aquatic vertebrate strains comes from a report by Ucko and Colorni ( 34 ) comparing 20 human isolates of M . marinum with 12 ﬁsh isolates from the Red Sea . In that study , human isolates were distinguished phenotypically and genotyp - ically from ﬁsh isolates from the Red Sea in Israel . In our study we further distinguish the Red and Mediterranean Sea ﬁsh isolates from other groups of M . marinum strains by showing that these isolates produce a mycolactone toxin . This work also supports earlier studies describing discrete populations of M . marinum strains in Israel ( 34 ) . Why is it that the vast majority of M . marinum strains do not produce mycolactone ? One possibility is that not all strains are capable of acting as recipients for the mycolactone plasmid . This is supported by the fact that MPMM strains form a group distinct from other M . marinum isolates in Israel . An interest - ing parallel may exist between Shigella species and mycolac - tone - producing mycobacteria . Although it is convenient to look at Shigella species as Escherichia coli with an invasion plasmid , not all E . coli strains can act as recipients for the plasmid . In particular , the loss of outer membrane proteins is a prerequisite for conjugal competency . What are the host requirements for horizontal transfer of the mycolactone plas - mid ? One possibility is that insertion of IS 2404 in M . ulcerans , MPMM , M . liﬂandii , and M . pseudoshottsii has resulted in loss of membrane - associated genes , thus rendering them compe - tent for horizontal transfer . Alternatively , these strains may have acquired genes enabling horizontal transfer , although this explanation would be inconsistent with molecular evidence suggesting that M . ulcerans evolved from an M . marinum an - cestor . Most of the studies on M . marinum and most of the strains in collections are from infected humans . These strains FIG . 6 . Analysis of mycolactone - mediated cytopathicity .

We cannot rule out the possibility that a more thorough analysis of nonhuman M . marinum isolates might show that MPMM are “typical” strains . Given the importance of the mycolactone plasmid for viru - lence of M . ulcerans , what is the likely virulence of MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii for humans ? Although mycolactone F is toxic for human cells , this is relevant to human disease only if MPMM or M . pseudoshottsii strains are capable of colonizing mammalian species . The temperature - restricted growth of MPMM and M . pseudoshottsii may well be a barrier to infec - tion of mammalian species . However , mycolactone - producing aquatic mycobacteria may provide a reservoir for genes impor - tant for the evolution of new human pathogens .
