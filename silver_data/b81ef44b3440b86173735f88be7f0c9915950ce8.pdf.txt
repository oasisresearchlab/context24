Incubation of large unilamellar liposomes with mice brain cytosol led to massive formation of small vesicles , whereas cytosol of amphiphysin 1 knockout mice was much less efﬁcient in this reaction . Vesicle formation from large liposomes by puriﬁed dynamin was also strongly enhanced by amphiphysin . In the presence of liposomes , amphiphysin strongly affected dynamin GTPase activity and the recruitment of dynamin to the liposomes , but this activity was highly dependent on liposome size . Deletion from amphiphysin of its central proline - rich stretch dramatically potentiated its effect on dynamin , possibly by relieving an inhibitory intramole - cular interaction . These results suggest a model in which maturation of endocytic pits correlates with the oligomer - ization of dynamin with either amphiphysin or other proteins with similar domain structure . Formation of these complexes is coupled to the activation of dynamin GTPase activity , thus explaining how deep invagination of the pit leads to ﬁssion .

It is completed by the ﬁssion reaction in which dynamin GTPase plays a key role ( Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ; Takei and Haucke , 2001 ) . Dynamin poly - merizes into rings at the neck of clathrin - coated pits , but its precise mechanism of action in ﬁssion remains unclear . In vitro studies have shown that dynamin binds to lipids , and it can deform lipid bilayers into narrow tubules and frag - ment them in a GTP - hydrolysis - dependent way . Thus , one model proposes that dynamin acts as a mechanoenzyme , that is , by constricting the vesicle neck via a conformational change coupled to its catalytic action ( Takei et al , 1995 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Marks et al , 2001 ; Chen et al , 2004 ) . Another model proposes that GTP - bound dynamin functions by activating a still unidentiﬁed downstream effec - tor ( Sever et al , 1999 ; Song and Schmid , 2003 ) . The GTPase module of dynamin is located at the N - terminus of the protein . This domain is followed by the evolutionary con - served middle domain , a plecstrin homology ( PH ) domain , and the C - terminal proline / arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) . The region between the PH domain and the PRD is referred to as the GTPase effector domain ( GED ) , because it binds the GTPase module of adjacent dynamin molecules within dyna - min polymers and may function as a GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) ( Muhlberg et al , 1997 ) . The PH domain binds phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , while the PRD binds a variety of src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain - containing proteins . These interactions also have been reported to stimulate dynamin GTPase activity ( Gout et al , 1993 ; Zheng et al , 1996 ; Barylko et al , 1998 ) . Dynamin 1 is the best - characterized dynamin isoform and is enriched at synapses . Amphiphysin , which is present in brain primarily as a dimer of two similar isoforms , amphiphysin 1 and 2 , is a major binding partner of dynamin 1 in the vertebrate nervous system . Amphiphysin binds the PRD of dynamin via a C - terminal SH3 domain and co - assembles with dynamin into rings either in solution or on lipid tubules ( Takei et al , 1999 ) . This interaction is expected to be physiologically important in nerve terminals , because acute disruption of amphiphysin by peptide microinjection leads to a block of synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( Shupliakov et al , 1997 ) . The N - terminal portion of amphiphysin contains a BAR ( BIN / am - phiphysin / Rvs ) domain that mediates homo - and heterodi - merization ( Wigge et al , 1997 ; Ramjaun et al , 1999 ) . Via this domain , amphiphysin , like dynamin , binds to and tubulates liposomes ( Takei et al , 1999 ) , and can also generate narrow plasma membrane tubules in living cells when overexpressed ( Peter et al , 2004 ) . The structure of the BAR domain of amphiphysin was recently determined by crystallographic analysis and found to represent an evolutionary conserved protein module pre - sent in a variety of proteins ( Habermann , 2004 ; Peter et al , 2004 ) .

It was proposed that lipid interactions mediated by the concave portion of this module , in cooperation with an amphipathic N - terminal helix ( Farsad et al , 2001 ) , may be responsible for its property to curve the bilayer ( Peter et al , 2004 ) . In addition , lipid - binding studies revealed preferential binding to small liposomes , suggesting that the BAR domain may also function as a curvature sensor , thus facilitating the recruit - ment of amphiphysin to pre - existing high curvature mem - branes ( Peter et al , 2004 ) . Curvature - sensitive properties of proteins may have an important role in orchestrating vesicle formation and ﬁssion , with the sequential recruitment and dissociation of cytosolic factor ( Bigay et al , 2003 ) . The central region of brain amphiphysin 1 and 2 contains binding sites for clathrin and for the clathrin adopter protein 2 ( AP - 2 ) ( Ramjaun and McPherson , 1998 ; Slepnev et al , 2000 ; Miele et al , 2004 ) . Via this multiplicity of interactions , which are regulated by an intramolecular binding ( Farsad et al , 2003 ) , cyclin - dependent kinase 5 - dependent phosphorylation ( Floyd et al , 2001 ; Tomizawa et al , 2003 ) and calcineurin - dependent dephosphorylation ( Bauerfeind et al , 1997 ) , amphiphysin is thought to play an important role in coordinating vesicle budding and ﬁssion ( Farsad et al , 2003 ) . Accordingly , defects in synaptic vesicle recycling were demonstrated in amphi - physin 1 knockout mice ( Di Paolo et al , 2002 ) . In these mice , not only expression of amphiphysin 1 is suppressed , but also the level of amphiphysin 2 is severely reduced in brain , probably due to the stabilizing effect of the amphiphysin heterodimer on the turnover of amphiphysin 2 . Although these studies support the importance of the amphiphysin – dynamin interaction in endocytosis , it remains unclear whether amphiphysin is directly implicated together with dynamin in the ﬁssion reaction . The reported lack of signiﬁcant amphiphysin expression in Drosophila neurons ( Leventis et al , 2001 ; Razzaq et al , 2001 ; Zelhof et al , 2001 ) and of a major synaptic vesicle recycling defect in amphiphy - sin 1 knockout mice raise questions on the importance of this partnership . However , other proteins with similar domain structure and enriched at synapses , for example , endophilin and intersectin / pacsin , may functionally replace amphi - physin ( Simpson et al , 1999 ; Modregger et al , 2000 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Farsad et al , 2001 ) . In this study , we demonstrate the importance of amphiphysin for the vesicle - generating properties of dynamin 1 within the context of mouse brain cytosol in vitro . We also show a striking stimulatory effect of amphiphysin 1 on the GTPase activity of dynamin in the presence of liposomes , which is dependent on the size of liposomes . Results Amphiphysin potentiates vesicle formation by dynamin Dynamin - dependent vesicle formation can be reconstituted in vitro by incubation of large unilamellar liposomes with brain cytosol in the presence of nucleotides , and monitored quantitatively by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) ( Kinuta et al , 2002 ) . To establish the importance of amphiphysin in vesicle formation , we compared brain cytosol from wild - type and amphiphysin 1 knockout mice in this assay . The brain cytosol of the knockout mice is also nearly completely devoid of amphiphysin 2 . When incubated with large unilamellar liposomes ( 1779 . 5 7 461 . 7nm in diameter ) ( Figure 1A ) , wild - type cytosol induced a massive formation of small vesicles ( 112 . 3 7 19 . 7 nm in diameter ) ( Figure 1B ) , while knockout mice brain cytosol was very inefﬁcient in this process ( Figure 1C ) . At the end of the incubation , small vesicles represented 82 . 9 7 11 . 7 % of the total vesicle number in the wild - type cytosol sample , but only 6 . 8 7 5 . 5 % in the knock - out cytosol sample ( Figure 1B and C ) . Addition of puriﬁed amphiphysin 1 ( 0 . 5 m g / ml ) to the knockout cytosol rescued vesicle formation , with small vesicles ( 176 . 8 7 33 . 9nm in diameter ) representing 82 . 1 7 4 . 3 % of the total vesicles at the end of the reaction ( Figure 1E ) . No vesicle formation was observed when liposomes were incubated with amphiphysin 1 alone ( Figure 1D ) . Results of these assays are summarized in Figure 1F . We next examined the effect of puriﬁed amphiphysin 1 on vesicle formation by puriﬁed dynamin . Large unilamellar liposomes were incubated with dynamin alone or a mixture of dynamin plus amphiphysin 1 in the presence of GTP . At the end of the reaction , small vesicles represented 15 . 7 7 12 . 7 % of the total vesicles ( Figure 2B and D ) in the sample contain - ing dynamin 1 alone , and 71 . 1 7 4 . 5 % of the total in the samples containing both proteins ( Figure 2C and D ) , thus indicating a potent action of amphiphysin 1 on the vesicle - generating properties of dynamin . Massive fragmentation of liposomes into small vesicles following incubations with dynamin and amphiphysin 1 was conﬁrmed by negative staining electron microscopy ( EM ) ( Figure 2E ) . Stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity by amphiphysin is affected by liposome size To gain some insight into the mechanisms through which amphiphysin 1 stimulates dynamin - dependent vesicle forma - tion , we examined whether amphiphysin 1 enhanced dyna - min GTPase activity . Addition of increasing amount of amphiphysin 1 to a reaction mixture containing dynamin , [ g - 32 P ] GTP and large unilamellar liposomes ( 1779 . 5 7 461 . 7 nm in diameter ) composed of a brain lipid extract ( Folch fraction type 1 , FF ) ( 74 % , w / w ) , cholesterol ( 20 % ) and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 6 % ) produced a prominent increase in the GTPase activity . The activity was maximal when the molar ratio of dynamin to amphiphysin 1 was in the 1 : 1 – 2 range ( Figure 3A ) . Such effect may be explained in part by en - hanced recruitment of dynamin , because amphiphysin also increased the recruitment of dynamin to large liposomes ( approximately two - fold ) ( Figure 3D ) . Since small liposomes were often utilized in previous studies on dynamin GTPase activity ( Tuma et al , 1993 ; Barylko et al , 1998 ) , we also tested small liposomes prepared by sonication ( 80 . 7 7 10 . 8nm in diameter ) in the GTPase assay . In the absence of amphiphysin , the GTPase activity of dynamin was much higher with small liposomes than with large liposomes , possibly due to a more efﬁcient oligomer - ization of dynamin on small liposomes . Surprisingly , addition of increasing amount of amphiphysin 1 led to a drastic decrease in the GTPase activity in the presence of the small liposomes . The molar ratio that generated maximal stimula - tion in the presence of large liposomes produced a 75 % inhibition under these conditions ( Figure 3B ) . A similar inhibitory effect was observed also with small liposomes prepared by extrusion ( 143 . 8 7 31 . 7nm in diameter ) ( Figure 3C ) , ruling out a possible effect of sonication on the properties of the bilayer . Thus , the effect of amphiphysin 1 on The stimulatory action of amphiphysin on dynamin Y Yoshida et al The EMBO Journal VOL 23 | NO 17 | 2004 & 2004 European Molecular Biology Organization 3484 dynamin GTPase activity is strongly affected by the size of the liposomes . An attractive possibility is that the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity is related to the property of amphiphysin and dynamin to co - oligomerize into ring structures around mem - brane tubules . While large liposomes allow massive tubula - tion ( Takei et al , 1999 ) , the size of the small liposomes may be incompatible with tubulation and constriction , explaining the different results obtained with large and small liposomes . Stimulatory action of amphiphysin is affected by lipid component If the effect of amphiphysin on dynamin GTPase activity is linked to its property to co - oligomerize with dynamin on tubular membranes , the effect should be strongly dependent Figure 1 Requirement of amphiphysin 1 for vesicle formation by brain cytosol .

Therefore , we examined whether amphiphysin stimulates dynamin GTPase activity in the presence or absence of liposomes . In the absence of liposomes , the GTPase activity of dynamin was low , and amphiphysin 1 stimulated this activity only slightly , approxi - Figure 4 Effect of the lipid composition on stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity by amphiphysin 1 .

The presence of large unilamellar liposomes ( FF ( 74 % , w / w ) , cholesterol ( 20 % ) and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 6 % ) ) produced a 2 . 6 - fold increase in dynamin GTPase activity ( compare lanes 1 and 3 in Figure 4A ) , and the additional presence of amphi - physin 1 produced a further 3 . 1 - fold stimulation ( compare lanes 3 and 4 in Figure 4A ) . Replacement of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with L - a - phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) in the liposomes reduced the stimulation produced by the liposomes ( compare lanes 3 and 5 in Figure 4A ) , consistent with the known role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in dynamin recruitment and activation . However , the stimulatory effect of amphiphysin 1 on the GTPase activity of dynamin was nearly unaffected ( approxi - mately 3 . 4 - fold ) ( compare lanes 5 and 6 in Figure 4A ) . Another acidic phospholipid was tested . L - a - Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) was reported to support the binding and polymerization of both dynamin and amphiphysin 1 and to stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin ( Figure 4B , Tuma et al , 1993 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al , 1999 ) . Thus , liposomes containing variable amounts of PS ( from 20 to 80 % ) were used in the tubulation and GTPase assays . Amphiphysin 1 tubulated very efﬁciently liposomes contain - ing the higher concentrations of PS ( Figure 4B , Takei et al , 1999 ) . The GTPase activity of dynamin in the absence of amphiphysin 1 increased linearly in parallel with the con - centration of PS ( Figure 4C , open circles ) . The presence of amphiphysin 1 produced an additional powerful stimulation of the GTPase activity , which was highly synergistic as the amount of PS was increased . The sigmoidal shape of the stimulation curve indicated a strong positive cooperativity when the amount of PS was between 40 and 60 % ( Figure 4C , closed circles ) , possibly reﬂecting gathering of PS and preferential assembly of dynamin – amphiphysin polymers on PS - rich microdomains . Both BAR domain and SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 are required for the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity The effect of truncated amphiphysin 1 molecules ( Figure 5A ) was investigated to identify the domains of the protein responsible for its stimulatory action on the catalytic activity of dynamin . These fragments were tested in the presence of large liposomes composed of FF ( 74 % ) , cholesterol ( 20 % ) and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 6 % ) . Under this assay condition , full - length amphiphysin 1 stimulated the GTPase activity about three - fold ( Figure 5B , see also lanes 3 and 4 in Figure 4A ) . A roughly similar stimulation was produced by Amph 1 – 226 , which comprises the BAR domain only , and by Amph 1 – 306 , which contains an additional ﬂanking region at the C - term - inal side of this domain . Strikingly , Amph D 248 – 601 , which contains both BAR and SH3 domains , but lacks the central region , produced a 26 - fold stimulation of the GTPase activity . As the proline - rich stretch binds intramolecularly to the SH3 domain and regulates negatively the interaction of amphi - physin with dynamin ( Farsad et al , 2003 ) , we also tested Amph D 248 – 315 , a mutant lacking the proline - rich stretch . This mutant stimulated the GTPase activity about three - fold over the value obtained with full - length amphiphysin 1 . Amph 545 – 695 alone , corresponding to the C - terminal SH3 domain , had no effect ( Figure 5B ) . Furthermore , stimulation of the GTPase activity by the BAR domain was not enhanced by the presence of the free SH3 domain ( data not shown ) . These results suggested that presence of both the BAR domain and the SH3 domain in a single molecule was critical for the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity . The observed effects of the amphiphysin deletion con - structs on the GTPase activity of dynamin correlated qualita - tively with their property to enhance dynamin recruitment to large liposomes , with Amph D 248 – 601 producing a more than three - fold increase in recruitment ( Figure 5C ) . Both BAR domain and SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 are sufﬁcient for the formation of rings The incubation of dynamin and amphiphysin 1 in physiolo - gical buffer results in the formation of ring structures , similar in size to dynamin - containing collars of endocytic pits ( Takei et al , 1999 ) . These collars are thought to represent a transient Figure 5 Amphiphysin 1 domains required for the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity .

The stimulatory action of amphiphysin on dynamin Y Yoshida et al & 2004 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 23 | NO 17 | 2004 3487 intermediate in the ﬁssion reaction . We used negative stain - ing EM to determine whether these rings were present following incubation of dynamin with the truncated amphi - physins . Rings were observed after incubation of dynamin with full - length amphiphysin 1 , with Amph D 248 – 315 , or with Amph D 248 – 601 , but not with the other amphiphysin 1 fragment ( Figure 6 ) . The diameter of rings with Amph D 248 – 601 ( 41 . 2 7 3 . 0nm of outer diameter and 22 . 3 7 2 . 6nm of inner diameter ) was slightly shorter than that of rings with amphiphysin 1 ( outer diameter 51 . 7 7 4 . 3nm and inner diameter 27 . 5 7 3 . 3nm ) . Discussion We provide strong evidence for the physiological role of amphiphysin in the regulation of dynamin function and new insights concerning the mechanisms through which amphiphysin achieves this effect . Several previous reports , including studies in living cells and cell - free studies , had suggested an important partnership of amphiphysin and dynamin in the ﬁssion reaction of endocytic vesicles , in particular in the ﬁssion of recycling synaptic vesicles at synapses ( Shupliakov et al , 1997 ; Takei et al , 1999 ) . Yet , the importance of this interaction has been challenged by studies in Drosophila , where amphiphysin is expressed pri - marily outside the nervous system ( Leventis et al , 2001 ; Razzaq et al , 2001 ; Zelhof et al , 2001 ) , and by the relatively mild neurotransmission defects observed in amphiphysin 1 knockout mice ( Di Paolo et al , 2002 ) , which lack both amphiphysin 1 and 2 in the neuronal cytosplasm . In contrast with these ﬁndings , we have now found that the property of brain cytosol to vesiculate large liposomes is drastically impaired in the cytosol of amphiphysin 1 knockout brain ( Figure 1 ) . Since this property was previously shown to be mediated mainly by dynamin ( Takei et al , 1998 ; Kinuta et al , 2002 ) , our ﬁndings point to a role of amphiphysin in the regulation of dynamin . Addition of amphiphysin 1 is sufﬁ - cient to rescue the defect of the knockout brain cytosol , indicating that in this assay the amphiphysin 1 homodimer and the amphiphysin 1 / 2 heterodimer have similar proper - ties . The discrepancy between these in vitro results and in vivo data may reﬂect the compensatory action in vivo of other BAR domain - containing proteins ( Peter et al , 2004 ) , such as endophilin and syndapin / pacsin , that have a domain struc - ture similar to amphiphysin ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Habermann , 2004 ; Peter et al , 2004 ) and are also present at synapses . The importance of amphiphysin relative to other proteins with overlapping function may be greater in in vitro assays than in situ because of differential compartmentaliza - tion and / or regulation in living nerve terminals . Furthermore , yet unidentiﬁed molecules present in cellular membranes , and absent in our cell - free assays , may compensate for the absence of amphiphysin . We have found that the property of amphiphysin to stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin is critically inﬂu - enced by the presence of liposomes and that this effect , in turn , is strongly affected by the composition and size of liposomes ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . The presence of acidic phos - pholipids is required , as expected . Amphiphysin stimulated the GTPase activity of dynamin and its binding on large unilamellar liposomes . Large liposomes , which can be eva - ginated to narrow tubules , may allow dynamin and amphi - physin to co - oligomerize into a stack of rings , and the co - oligomers bound to lipids may represent the conﬁguration with the maximal GTPase activity . In contrast , amphiphysin inhibited the GTPase activity , with little change in the dyna - min recruitment in the presence of small liposomes . These results suggest that amphiphysin – dynamin rings may not assemble on small liposomes , whose size may prevent the formation of narrow tubular membranes . In this context , amphiphysin may in fact perturb dynamin polymerization . The effect of amphiphysin 1 on the GTPase activity of dynamin was analyzed previously ( Wigge et al , 1997 ; Takei et al , 1999 ) . We have reported that amphiphysin 1 stimulates dynamin GTPase activity in the absence of liposomes , and that in the presence of liposomes addition of amphiphysin 1 did not further stimulate this activity ( Takei et al , 1999 ) . A stimulatory effect of amphiphysin 1 and 2 on the catalytic activity of dynamin was also reported by another group ( Wigge et al , 1997 ) . As clearly indicated in this study , the activity of dynamin is dependent on the experimental condi - tions , thus explaining the inconsistency between the results reported here and previous studies . As for the molecular mechanisms by which amphiphysin stimulates dynamin GTPase activity , some clues are provided by experiments using amphiphysin deletion mutants ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . Surprisingly , BAR domain - containing constructs that miss the dynamin - binding domain ( the SH3 domain ) can stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin in the presence of liposomes ( Figure 5B ) . Most likely , the powerful liposome - tubulating activity of these constructs enhances the GTPase activity by providing a template for dynamin polymerization .

The stimulatory action of amphiphysin on dynamin Y Yoshida et al The EMBO Journal VOL 23 | NO 17 | 2004 & 2004 European Molecular Biology Organization 3488 Although dynamin alone can tubulate liposomes , it may assemble more efﬁciently on previously formed lipid tubules . For example , dynamin has been reported to assemble efﬁ - ciently on preformed lipid tubules ( Stowell et al , 1999 ) and microtubules ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . The amphiphysin construct missing the central region , or a portion of it comprising the proline - rich stretch , stimulated dynamin GTPase activity more potently than full - length amphiphysin . This is consistent with the occurrence of an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction in amphiphysin ( Farsad et al , 2003 ) . The SH3 domain alone had no effect on the GTPase activity of dynamin in the presence of liposomes . This indicates that the importance of the SH3 domain relates to its ability to recruit dynamin to the membrane via the BAR domain . Collectively , these results provide new support for the hypothesis that amphiphysin functions together with dynamin in ﬁssion ( Takei et al , 1999 ) , both by helping the generation of membrane curvature and by facilitating the recruitment and oligomerization of dynamin . The precise orientation of dynamin and amphiphysin in the rings remains to be elucidated . The amphiphysin – dynamin rings are similar in diameter to the rings formed by dynamin alone . This observation suggests a model in which amphiphysin and dynamin are arranged side by side along the ring . Such arrangement would be consistent with the greater thickness of the hybrid amphiphysin – dynamin ring ( Takei et al , 1999 ) . Cryo - EM studies have shown that dyna - min rings generated by puriﬁed dynamin 1 around tubular liposomes comprise about 13 – 15 dynamin dimers ( Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ; Chen et al , 2004 ) . Considering the curvature of the BAR domain , a ring could not accommodate an equivalent number of crescent - shaped BAR domains ( Peter et al , 2004 ) . Thus , BAR domains may be arranged obliquely , with their positively charged edges juxtaposed to the negatively charged middle portion of the adjacent BAR domain ( Figure 7 ) . Irrespective of the precise stoichiometry of amphiphysin and dynamin around tubular lipid templates , these results add new strong support to a model implicating amphiphysin in the regulation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Figure 7 ) . At early stages of clathrin - coated pit formation , the curvature - generating properties of amphiphysin may help maturation of the bud into a deeply invaginated pit . In addition , via a positive feedback mechanism , preference of its BAR domain for a curved membrane with radius in the size range of bud neck may enhance its concentration at the neck as the coated pit forms . This concentration could facilitate dynamin oligo - merization into a ring . Dynamin recruitment may be further facilitated by the binding of the central domain of amphi - physin to clathrin and AP - 2 , which results in the release of the SH3 domain from the autoinhibitory intramolecular inter - action ( Farsad et al , 2003 ) . In conclusion , our results suggest a model in which narrowing of the stalk of an endocytic pits is coupled to activation of dynamin GTPase activity , thus explaining how the deep invagination of the pit may lead to ﬁssion . Materials and methods Materials Bovine brain lipid extract ( Folch fraction type I , FF ) and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from bovine brain were purchased from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) . PS and PC were from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . Glutathione sepharose 4B beads , pGEX - 6P vector , PreScission protease and thrombin were from Amersham Bioscience ( Piscat - away , NJ ) . [ g - 32 P ] GTP ( 5kCi / mol ) was from the Institute of Isotopes Co . Ltd ( Hungary ) . Preparation of brain cytosol and dynamin 1 Brain cytosol from wild - type mice and amphiphysin 1 knockout mice ( Di Paolo et al , 2002 ) was prepared essentially by the previous method and used ( Kinuta et al , 2002 ) . Dynamin 1 was puriﬁed from bovine brains by the method of Liu et al ( 1994 ) . The dynamin solution was concentrated using Centriplus YM50 ( Millipore , MA ) , and stored at (cid:2) 80 1 C . The protein solution ( 0 . 6mg / ml protein ) was thawed at 37 1 C before use . Preparation of amphiphysin 1 and its truncation constructs The cDNAs encoding full - length human amphiphysin 1 and its truncation constructs were prepared by PCR ampliﬁcation using speciﬁc primers . Full - length amphiphysin 1 , Amph 1 – 226 and 1 – 306 were subcloned into pGEX - 6P vector as Bam HI – Eco RI fragments . To prepare Amph D 248 – 315 , Amph 1 – 247aa was Figure 7 Possible function of amphiphysin in the ﬁssion process of endocytic pit . ( 1 ) Amphiphysin is recruited to the membrane initiating invagination either via its BAR domain or via clathrin / AP - 2 - binding domain . ( 2 ) The BAR domain may help generating the bud neck of the appropriate dimensions . ( 3 ) As the pit has been matured , amphiphysin could be more efﬁciently recruited to the neck due to its curvature - sensing properties . Dynamin also assembles to form a ring at the bud neck , and its GTPase is fully activated so that vesicle ﬁssion is achieved . Coat components are omitted .

Eco RI – Eco RI fragment containing Amph 316 – 695aa was then inserted into the Eco RI site . As for Amph D 248 – 601 , BAR domain was subcloned into pGEX - 6P vector as a Bam HI – Nco I fragment , and inserted at the Bam HI – Nco I site of full - length amphiphysin 1 plasmid described above . The SH3 domain was subcloned into pGEX - 2T vector . The nucleotide sequences of the constructs were veriﬁed using a DNA sequence analyzer . The expression of GST - fusion proteins was induced by 0 . 1mM isopropyl - 1 - thio - b - D - galactopyranoside at 37 1 C for 3 – 6h in LB medium supplemented with 100 m g / ml ampicillin at A 600 ¼ 0 . 8 . The puriﬁcation of GST - fusion proteins was performed as described previously ( Slepnev et al , 2000 ) , and the cleavage of the GSTwith PreScission protease was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Finally , it was puriﬁed on MonoQ column equilibrated in 20mM Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 7 ) and 0 . 2M NaCl . The protein solution ( 1mg / ml protein ) was stored at (cid:2) 80 1 C , and thawed at 37 1 C before use . Preparation of liposomes Large unilamellar liposomes in 0 . 3M sucrose ( 1mg / ml ) were prepared as described ( Takei et al , 2001 ) . The size of large uni - lamellar liposomes measured using DLS was 1779 . 5 7 461 . 7nm in diameter . Small liposomes were made from large unilamellar liposomes by sonication ( 80 . 7 7 10 . 8nm in diameter ) . Extruded liposomes were prepared by extrusion of large liposomes through polycarbonate membranes with pores of 100nm for ﬁve times ( 143 . 8 7 31 . 7nm in diameter ) . Formation of small vesicles from liposomes Large unilamellar liposomes composed of 80 % ( w / w ) FF and 20 % cholesterol in 0 . 3M sucrose ( 1mg / ml ) were prepared as described previously ( Takei et al , 1999 ) . Vesicle formation was performed by the method of Kinuta et al ( 2002 ) , with minor modiﬁcation . A reaction mixture ( 500 m l ) containing cytosolic buffer ( 25mM Hepes – KOH ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 25mM KCl , 2 . 5mM magnecium acetate , 100mM potassium glutamate ) , 100 m g of liposomes , brain cytosol from either wild - type or amphiphysin knockout mice ( 500 m g / ml protein ) , 2mM ATP and 200 m M GTP was incubated at 37 1 C for 15min .

The size and relative numbers in each size of the formed vesicles were measured by DLS assay ( Kinuta et al , 2002 ; Tomizawa et al , 2003 ) . Formed vesicles smaller than 200nm in diameter were deﬁned as small vesicles . Liposome sedimentation assay For liposome sedimentation assay , in vitro incubation was performed under the similar protein lipid concentration as used for GTPase assay . Dynamin ( 0 . 2 m M ) and amphiphysin ( 0 . 4 m M ) or amphiphysin truncation construct ( 0 . 4 m M ) were incubated with 10 m g of liposomes , composed of 74 % ( w / w ) FF , 20 % cholesterol and 6 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , in the cytosolic buffer at 37 1 C for 15min .
