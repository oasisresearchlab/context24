Changes in Lysosome Shape and Distribution Correlated with Changes in Cytoplasmic pH John Heuser Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis , Missouri 63110 Abstract . Lysosomes labeled by uptake of extracellu - lar horseradish peroxidase display remarkable changes in shape and cellular distribution when cytoplasmic pH is experimentally altered . Normally , lysosomes in macrophages and fibroblasts cluster around the cell center . However , when the cytoplasmic pH is lowered to (cid:127)pH 6 . 5 by applying acetate or by various other means , lysosomes promptly move outward and ac - cumulate in tight clusters at the very edge of the cell , particularly in regions that are actively ruffling before acidification but become quiescent . This movement follows the distribution of microtubules in these cells , and does not occur if microtubules are depolymerized with nocodazole before acidification . Subsequent re - moval of acetate or the other stimuli to acidification results in prompt resumption of ruffling activity and return of lysosomes into a tight cluster at the cell cen - ter . This is correlated with a rebound alkalinization of the cytoplasm . Correspondingly , direct application of weak bases also causes hyperruffling and unusually complete withdrawal of lysosomes to the cell center . Thus , lysosomes appear to be acted upon by micro - tubule - based motors of both the anterograde ( kinesin ) type as well as the retrograde ( dynein ) type , or else they possess bidirectional motors that are reversed by changes in cytoplasmic pH . During the outward move - ments induced by acidification , lysosomes also appear to be smaller and more predominantly vesicular than normal , while during inward movements they appear to be more confluent and elongated than normal , often becoming even more tubular than in phorbol - treated macrophages ( Phaire - Washington , L . , S . C . Silverstein , and E . Wang . 1980 . J . Cell Biol . 86 : 641 - 655 ) . These size and shape changes suggest that cytoplasmic pH also affects the fusion / fission properties of lysosomes . Combined with pH effects on their movement , the net result during recovery from acidification is a stretching of lysosomes into tubular forms along microtubules . ECENT demonstrations of extended tubular lysosomes in macrophages and other cells ( 2 , 16 , 49 , 56 , 67 , 72 ) has raised interesting questions about the mecha - nisms that control the shape and distribution of these intra - cellular organelles . Lysosomes have generally been viewed as discrete vesicular structures that tend to concentrate in and around the cell center ( 11 , 12 , 33 , 68 - 71 ) . For them to be - come tubules that radiate out from the cell center , they pre - sumably have to fuse with each other and move outward by an active process . Experimental disruption of microtubules eliminates their outward radiation ( 72 ) , suggesting that the active process may be a microtubule - based motor of the kinesin type , like the one that transports membrane organ - elles in an " anterograde " direction in neurons ( 7 , 29 , 36 , 66 , 78 , 79 ) . Lysosomes have long been known to accumulate centrally ( 4 , 12 , 13 , 24 , 25 , 47 ) , suggesting they have " retro - grade " motors ; however outward movements have only re - cently been detected ( 15 , 23 , 24 , 41 ) . The ultimate distribu - tion and form of these pleomorphic organelles may thus boil down to a balance between membrane fusion and fission and between the activities of anterograde and retrograde motors . Here , we describe several experimental protocols that ap - pear to tip this balance toward lysosomal fission and outward movement . The protocols all produce a significant cytoplas - mic acidification , to the range of " opH 6 . 5 . We also demon - strate that a converse alkalinization of the cytoplasm to the range of pH , o7 . 8 appears to " reset " the balance in the oppo - site direction , toward lysosome fusion into tubes and inward movement of the tubes . Although these experimental pH changes probably bypass or short - circuit normal cellular controls , we discuss how they may reflect and help to il - luminate the normal mechanisms by which cells control their endosome and lysosome distribution . Materials and Methods Cell Cultures Chick fibroblasts , mouse macrophages , and J774 cells were chosen for these experiments . The chick cells were second - generation primary cells , ob - tained by trypsin / EDTA resuspension of 1 - wk - old cultures of homogenized chicken embryo pectoral muscle . The mouse macrophages were also sec - ond - generation primary cells , obtained by resuspension of l - wk - old cultures of primary bone marrow cells grown in L - cell conditioned medium ( e . g . , medium containing CSF - I to induce cell division and differentiation 10 , 50 ) .

All were plated onto 22 - mm glass cov - erslips at 2 . 5 x 105 cells / ml in ~ - MEM containing 20 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum and the usual antibiotics . Experimental Treatments After 24 - 48 h in culture , before the cells began to approach confluence , they were removed from the CO2 incubator and washed three times over 15 min in Hepes - buffered Ringer ' s solution containing 0 . 5 mg / ml bovine serum al - bumin ( this solution is henceforth termed " Ringer ' s " ; cf . Table I ) to remove intracellular bicarbonate and allow their internal pH to drop back down to normal . Cells were then incubated in Ringer ' s plus one of the tracers listed in Table I , always for 20 - 30 min at 37°C with constant gentle stirring . After a 3 - 6 - min wash in tracer - free Ringer ' s at 37°C , cells were transferred to one of the experimental solutions listed in Table I . After various intervals de - scribed below , they were transferred to 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in the buffer indicated in Table I ( henceforth termed " fixed buffer " ) , and fixed for 30 rain at room temperature before being washed five times with fix buffer . Histochemical Treatments For horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) ~ histochemistry , coverslips with cells 1 . Abbreviation used in this paper : HRP , horseradish peroxidase . fixed as above were incubated 15 rain in 0 . 5 mg / ml diaminobenzidine in fix buffer , then 30 min in the same diaminobenzidine solution plus 0 . 01 % HzO2 to initiate out the histoehemical reaction ( 25 ) . For acid phosphatase histochernistry , cells were fixed in 1 . 5 % ( wt / vol ) pamformaldehyde rather than glutaraldehyde and reacted with one of the three mixtures indicated in Table I , according to published techniques ( 3 , 45 , 46 ) . Light Microscopy After histochemistry , coverslips were given a final brief postfixation for 1 min in 0 . 2 % OsO4 in fix buffer , then dehydrated rapidly via two rinses in each of 70 and 100 % ethanol and embedded in English Araldite epoxy resin by standard EM techniques ( 25 ) . The Araldite served as a mounting medi - um to attach the coverslips to a glass slide , and yielded better cellular mor - phology and greater permanence than the usual light microscopic mounting media . After polymerization of the Araldite at 80°C for 24 h , coverslips were viewed with a 100 × phase - contrast objective and photographed on Ko - dak T - Max ASA 100 black and white 35 - mm film . Results Lysosome Movements Provoked by Cytoplasmic Acidification and Alkalinization Endosomes and lysosomes were visualized by internalization of several different extracellular tracers ( Table I ) , all applied in sufficiently high concentration to insure that most uptake would occur via bulk internalization rather than via receptor - mediated membrane binding . The duration of uptake ( 30 min , including subsequent washes ) was sufficient to deliver these tracers to " late " endosomes or secondary lysosomes , i . e . , to endosomes that presumably had time to acidify and acquire lysosomal enzymes ( 21 , 44 , 64 , 71 , 81 ) . After tracer uptake , several different protocols of cytoplasmic acidifica - tion or alkalinization were applied ( Table I ) . All generally provoked the same patterns of lysosome redistribution ( Table II ) . Moreover , many additional cell types were studied , and in spite of major differences in the amount of tracer they in - ternalized , all showed the same redistributions of lysosomes upon changing cytoplasmic pH . In no case did these move - ments require external calcium : they occurred promptly and completely in calcium - free Ringer ' s and they were not pro - voked by direct application of 5 # M of the Ca + + - ionophores A23187 or ionomycin in the presence of 2 mM external Ca + + ( not shown ) . The phase - contrast light micrographs in Figs . 1 and 2 typify the changes in shape and distribution of HRP - loaded organelles observed . Figs . 1 a and 2 a illustrate the normal condition of these organelles in primary and cultured macro - phages after 20 min of loading and 10 min of washing away excess HRP . In such " control " cells , most lysosomes are con - centrated near the cell center ( Table II ) , and those in the pe - riphery appear vesicular . Figs . 1 b and 2 b illustrate the effects of replacing 70 mM of the NaC1 in the Ringer ' s with 70 mM of sodium acetate ( pH 6 . 9 ) : most of the HRP - loaded lysosomes move to the very edge of the cell . Simultaneously , the cell flattens out and loses most of its peripheral ruffles ( compare arrows in Fig . 1 a and 1 b ) . ( By time - lapse video - enhanced light microscopy , the remaining rim of ectoplasm in acidified cells is observed to be completely static . ) Figs . 1 c and 2 c illustrate that a 15 - min exposure to normal Ringer ' s after 15 rain of such acetate treatment results in a return of HRP - loaded organelles to the cell center , as well as a rounding up of the cell and reappearance of unusually broad ruffles ( compare arrows in Fig . 2 , b and c ) . ( Time - lapse microscopy at this point illustrates that such ruffles are The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 108 , 1989 856 Table 11 .

These are less dramatic because fibroblasts take up , 010 - fold less HRP than do macrophages ( 68 , 69 , 71 ) ; nevertheless , their HRP - loaded organdies are normally clus - tered centrally after the 30 min loading period ( Fig . 3 a ) , move outward in response to 70 mM acetate ( Fig . 3 b ) , and return to the cell center upon washout of acetate ( Fig . 3 c ) . Again , time - lapse microscopy illustrates a cessation of fibro - blast ruffling during acidification and hyperactivity during recovery . ) Measurements of intracellular pH made on parallel mono - layer cultures loaded with the pH - sensitive fluophore 2 ' , 7 ' - bis ( carboxyethyl ) - 5 , 6 - carboxyfluorescein ( 55 ) and analyzed by UV spectrofluorimetry , to be described in detail else - where ( Schlesinger , P . H . , and J . E . Heuser , manuscript in preparation ) , showed that immediately upon application of 70 mM acetate , cytoplasmic pH in mouse macrophages and chick fibroblasts falls to , , o6 . 5 and remains there for the dura - tion of the exposure . Upon washout of acetate , cytoplasmic pH immediately rebounds to , 00 . 5 pH units above normal ( , 0pH 7 . 8 ) and then slowly falls back to normal over the next 10 - 15 rain . The hyperactivity and unusually tight central clustering of HRP organdies seen during acetate washout ( Figs . 1 c and 2 c ) thus appear to correlate temporally with a period of rebound alkalinization . Correspondingly , direct alkalinization of macrophages by the addition of 10 - 20 mM NI - LC1 to their Ringer ' s raises their cytoplasmic pH by , 00 . 5 units and leads to the same structural changes in HRP - loaded organelles and ruffles as seen during acetate washout ( Tables II and I ] I ) . Experiments using nigericin " clamping " of cyto - plasmic pH over a wide range ( Fig . 4 ) indicate that there is not a pH threshold for this lysosome redistribution , but it oc - Figure 1 .

Identical organelle redistributions and shape - changes are observed in cells assayed for acid phosphatase rather than loaded with HRP ( Fig . 5 ) . Initially , acid phosphatase - stained organdies are clustered around the cell center ( Fig . 5 a ) ; af - ter 15 min in 70 mM acetate , they are redirected to the distal margins of the cell ( Fig . 5 b ) ; and after 10 min of acetate washout they are back in the cell center ( Fig . 5 c ) . Such acid phosphatase - positive organelles are presumably identical to the HRP - loaded organelles observed in Figs . 1 - 3 above , all qualifying for the name " secondary lysosomesY Changes in Lysosomal Shape Correlated with Cytoplasmic pH Table 1I documents that during acidification lysosomes also appear to be more vesicular than normal , while during re - bound alkalinization ( or during direct alkalinization with NI - LCI ; cf . Table HI , line 6 ) they appear to be more tubular than normal . This is visible by comparing Fig . 2 , a and c or Fig . 3 , a and c , for example . The formation of tubules is particularly dramatic during the early phases of recovery , when tight central clusters of lysosomes have not yet fully reformed but are in the process of doing so . Fig . 6 a illus - trates that long HRP - loaded tubules , extending all the way from the cell periphery to the cell center , can be found at this time . In some cases the tubules appear instead as closely aligned chains of vesicles ( Fig . 6 b ) , an effect known to be produced by glutaraldehyde fixation ( 56 , 72 ) . Role of Microtubules in Endosome Movements Neither the abundance nor the distribution of microtubules in macrophages ( Fig . 7 ) is altered by changes in cytoplas - mic pH , nor by HRP uptake ( not shown ) . To assess the role of microtubules in lysosomal redistribution patterns , HRP - loaded cells were treated with 2 # M nocodazole ( 5 min at 4°C , followed by 15 min at 37°C ) . Lysosomes appeared ran - domly distributed in such cells , and tubular forms were ab - sent . Moreover , when such cells were acidified in the pres - ence of nocodazole , lysosomes clumped locally but did not Figure 3 .

Lines 4 & 5 refer to cells that were loaded with HRP for 30 min and acidified with 70 mM Na acetate for 15 rain before being returned to normal Ringer ' s for recovery periods of 5 or 15 rain . Lines 6 & 7 refer to cells soaked in Ringer ' s containing 20 mM NI - hC ! after the usual 30 rain of HRP exposure in normal Ringer ' s . For each treatment , 100 cells from 3 independent experiments were categorized single - blindedly and the resulting proportions were rounded off to the nearest 0 . 05 . display any net outward movement . Likewise , if cells were first acidified and then treated with nocodazole , the periph - eral clusters of lysosomes dispersed . Subsequently , lyso - somes failed to move back into the cell center when normal cytoplasmic pH was restored . Organelles That Do Not Redistribute with Lysosomes During pH Changes As noted above , acidified cells become flat and lose their ruffles , while recovering cells become unusually round and hyperactive . These effects may be related to changes in cyto - plasmic viscosity : for example , phase - dense granules near the cell center display active Brownian movements in acid - ified cells but not in normal cells , as if released from passive constraints . Concomitant with these shape changes , organ - elles such as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria ( de - tected by DiOC6 staining ; references 73 , 74 ) , phase - dense granules ( presumably lipid droplets and residual bodies ; references 11 , 12 ) , and Golgi elements ( detected by anticlath - rin monoclonal antibodies kindly provided by E Brodsky , University of California , San Francisco ) all appear to dis - perse somewhat during acidification ( cell flattening ) and gather together again during recovery ( cell rounding ) . How - ever , none of these organelles show the extreme changes in localization displayed by the lysosome system ( Figs . 1 - 3 ) . There is no indication that they undergo the same active movements . Indications That " Early " Endosomes and Phagosomes Also Do Not Move Certain types of endocytotic organeUes also do not undergo the same microtubule - directed movements as lysosomes . The first are " early phagosomes ; marked by rhodamine - tagged 0 . 2 - # m latex beads . In one experiment , macrophages were exposed to Lucifer Yellow ( 1 mg / ml ) for 30 mln to preload the same compartments that were normally loaded with HRP , and were then exposed briefly to an acidifying medium that contained the rhodamine - tagged beads . After 5 min in this medium the cells were formaldehyde fixed and examined by fluorescence microscopy . This displayed the usual displacement of yellow lysosomes to the cell periphery ( Fig . 8 a ) , but the recently formed red - bead phagosomes re - mained randomly distributed ( Fig . 8 b ) . A second experiment was then devised to determine whether this result was due simply to different rates of move - ment of large vs . small compartments ( the red phagosomes being somewhat larger than the yellow lysosomes ) . Macro - phages of fibroblasts were labeled with HRP for the usual 30 rain but in the continuous presence of 70 mM acetate , which inhibits HRP uptake and leads to the appearance of relatively small HRP - containing inclusions ( Fig . 9 ) . Current thinking is that these are " early endosomes " that accumulate because cytoplasmic acidification prevents their maturation into later endosomes and lysosomes ( 14 , 62 , 81 ) . Of interest here is the fact that these compartments remain randomly distributed in the cell , in spite of their relatively small size and the pro - longed exposure to acidifying conditions . Acid phosphatase staining of parallel cells confirmed that lysosomes redis - tributed to the cell periphery as usual . If the HRP - containing organelles in this experiment are in fact early endosomes , their lack of response to pH changes may suggest that the ability to move may be a correlate of ( if not a prerequisite for ) endosome maturation . Discussion The microscopic observations presented here indicate that cytoplasmic acidification alters the normal distribution of secondary lysosomes around the cell center , apparently by provoking their outward movement along microtubules .

Circles with dots in the center represent the propor - tion of cells with predominantly centralized lysosomes , while open circles represent the proportion of cells that displayed displacement of lysosomes into at least two distinct peripheral clusters . Mono - layer cultures were first exposed to HRP in normal Ringer ' s for 20 min at 37°C and then incubated for 15 rain in 1 / ~ g / ml nigericin in isotonic K + media ( Table I ) buffered to the various values on the abscissa ( using 2 - [ N - morpholino ] ethane sulfonic acid [ MES ] buffer for pH 6 . 2 - 6 . 8 , Hcpes buffer for 7 . 0 - 7 . 6 , and EPPS buffer for 7 . 8 - 8 . 2 ) . After fixation and HRP histochemistry , 100 cells from two separate experiments were categorized single blindedly and the resulting proportions were rounded off to the nearest 0 . 05 . ( Not shown is the proportion of cells with neither peripheral nor central clusters , which brought the totals at each pH to 1 . 00 . These were clearly the majority at pH 7 . 0 - 7 . 2 ) . The lysosome pattern seen after 15 min in 70 mM acetate or 20 mM NI - hC1 ( cf . Table II ) would correlate best with the relative cell distributions shown at the ar - rows . Identical nigericin buffers were used to calibrate 2 ' , 7 ' - bis ( car - boxyethyl ) - 5 ~ 5 - carboxyfluorescein fluorescence measurements of cytoplasmic pH , according to established techniques ( 55 , 75 ) , which further confirmed that 70 mM acetate lowers cytoplasmic pH to ~ 6 . 4 - 6 . 6 while 20 mM NI - hCI raises it to ~ pH 7 . 8 - 8 . 0 ( 26 ) . suggests that lysosomes possess microtubule - based motors that can be influenced by ambient pH . Since lysosomes are normally found around the cell center , and can be seen to move toward the cell center by video microscopy ( 15 , 41 ) , it is likely that they possess retrograde motors of the sort that are generally turning out to be cytoplasmic dyneins ( 78 , 80 ) . On the other hand , since lysosomes also display bidirectional movements in video microscopy ( 15 , 41 ) , and now have been found to move away from the cell center in response to cyto - plasmic acidification , they may also possess anterograde mo - tors like kinesin ( see reference 78 for an excellent review of these motors ) . Why lysosomes would have anterograde mo - tors is not established . Perhaps they are needed to move lyso - somes to the cell periphery and fuse with incoming endo - somes , or perhaps they permit recycling components ( e . g . , receptors ) to move out and reenter the plasma membrane ( 65 ) . In any case , the net effect of cytoplasmic acidification may be to turn off a retrograde motor associated with lyso - somes and / or turn on an associated anterograde motor . Al - ternatively , acidification could reverse a single bidirectional motor ( 17 ) . Clearly it will be interesting to learn , in in vitro assays , whether acidity inhibits cytoplasmic dynein relative to kinesin and whether alkalinity does the opposite . Analogous OrganeUe Movements in Other Cell 1 ) pes The lysosome movements seen here are strikingly similar to the granule movements observed in melanophores and other pigmented cells ( 9 , 34 , 35 ) . In the latter , the mechanisms of pigment - granule movement are becoming clarified by the use of detergent - permeabilized cells ( 37 , 42 , 61 ) . Such " models " continue to move granules in an ATP - dependent manner and to display bulk redistributions of the granules in response to various experimental manipulations . For exam - ple , in melanophore models , pigment dispersal is activated by exogenous cyclic AMP ( 38 , 60 ) , raising the possibility that changes in cyclic AMP are correlated with the pH changes provoked in the present study . In preliminary experiments we have found that applying membrane - permeant dibutyryl - cyclic AMP ( 1 mM ) or forskolin ( 50 # M ) to macrophages Figure 5 .

However , since the effects of these reagents on cytoplasmic pH have not yet been assessed , it is not clear whether cyclic AMP is promoting a pH drop ( 30 , 54 ) or vice versa . In any case , it is attractive to speculate that in both pigment cells and cul - tured cells , cyclic AMP triggers the phosphorylation of pro - tein ( s ) that inhibit cytoplasmic dynein and / or stimulate kine - sin activity . In a similar vein , images strikingly analogous to the ones shown here were recently published in a study of microtu - bule - directed outward movement of secretory granules in cultured rat atrial myocytes ( 28 ) . These movements were in - duced by treatment with monesin , a Na : H ionophore that is Figure 7 . Fluorescence immunocytochemistry of microtubules in mouse bone marrow macrophages .

No changes from this typical abundance and " astral " pat - tern of radiation were observed during acetate or NH4CI treat - ment . Bar , 20 # m . generally thought to provoke cytoplasmic alkalinization ( 51 , 53 ) ; however , since monensin also raises intracellular so - dium in these cells ( 27 , 28 ) it may instead acidify them by shutting down their Na : H antiporter ( 32 , 39 , 43 ) . In either case , the observed redistribution of secretory granules pre - sumably represents an enhancement of their normal ability to move anterogradely along microtubules ( 40 , 77 ) . It will be interesting to determine whether changes in cytoplasmic pH accompany such movements , in these and other secretory cells . Possible Relation of OrganeUe Redistributions to Membrane Ruffling Activity The acid - induced redistribution of lysosomes seen here re - flects the overall polarity of the cell , in that they accumulate predominantly in regions that were originally ruffling . This is most apparent in J774 macrophages , which tend to ruffle at discrete poles and have microtubules running in bundles from the centrosphere region into these poles ( Fig . 2 ; see also Fig . 7 ) . This polarized microtubule distribution is thought to play a role in targeting the delivery of new membrane to growth areas ( 8 , 31 ) and in permitting these cells to direct secretion into specific areas were phagocytosis occurs . Thus there may be a link between the peripheral accumulation of organdies and the arrest of membrane ruffling seen here . Possibly , some of the accumulated organdies were destined to discharge in order to support the ruffling , but were pre - vented from fusing with the plasma membrane by cytoplas - mic acidification . This possibility could be evaluated by looking for an enhancement of membrane delivery to the cell surface during acetate washout or during cytoplasmic alka - linization , since both prompt the resumption of unusually ac - tive ruffling . The observed correlation between stimulation of outward organdie movement and inhibition of cell motility is strik - ingly similar to the behavior of certain neuronal growth cones in culture . Forscher et al . ( 18 ) have shown that phar - macological elevation of cyclic AMP in cultured Aplysia neu - rons causes rapid distal migration of organelles into growth cones , again with a concomitant retraction of their ruffles . This yields images of growth cones ( Fig . 5 b in reference 18 ) that appear almost identical to the distal processes of acid - ified macrophages ( especially Fig . 2 b ) . Similar movements Heuser pH - induced Changes in Lysosome Shape and Distribution 861 lqgure 8 . Demonstration that recently formed phagosomes do not accom - pany lysosomes during acid - induced outward movements . In a ( originally yellow ) , lysosomes were labeled with Lucifer Yellow by 30 - min incubation and then shifted to the periphery by 5 min of 70 mM acetate . ( Bright pe - ripheral clusters of lysosomes can be seen . ) During the acetate exposure , rhodamine - tagged latex beads were also supplied , b ( originally red ) illus - trates that the resultant phagosomes did not move outwards in acetate ( i . e . , few rhodamine - labeled organ - elles are seen in the peripheral areas that appear bright in a ) . Bar , 20 / ~ m . of organelles into growth cones apparently occur spontane - ously during the " consolidation " phase of normal neurite growth ( 1 ) . Such changes in growth cones develop with the same rapid time course as seen during acidification of mac - rophages and fibroblasts , and are also reversible . Again , it may turn out that cyclic AMP acidifies growth cones by shut - ting down their Na : H antiporters ( 22 , 30 , 54 ) . In this case , the mechanisms that coordinately alter organelle movement and cell ruffling could turn out to be much the same in all motile cells . Relating Lysosome Movements to Earlier Observations on Tabular Lysosomes The astral arrays of HRP - loaded tubular lysosomes seen here during recovery from acidification ( Fig . 5 ) , and also seen oc - casionally in untreated cells ( Table II ) , are very reminiscent of those described earlier in phorbol - treated peritoneal mac - rophages ( 49 , 72 ) . The latter cells were found to develop radiating arrays of tubular lysosomes as they spread out on the culture dish in response to phorbols ( 48 , 49 ) . The macro - phages used here are already as spread out as the phorbol - stimulated ones of these earlier studies , probably due to their long cultivation in CSF - bcontaining media ( 10 , 50 ) , and they often display tubular lysosomes at the outset ( Tables II and III ) . The outward movements induced by acidification thus start from this point and proceed to even further lysosome displacement . The deployment of lysosomal tubules has re - cently been witnessed directly by video microscopy ( 15 ) and has been found to be strictly dependent on the presence of microtubules ( 72 ) , suggesting that it involves an anterograde motor . Since cytoplasmic acidification causes these tubules as well as the more central elements of the lysosomal system to move all the way to the cell periphery , it could be inter - preted as excessive stimulation of this same mechanism . Whether this excess also causes the observed breakdown of lysosomal tubules into vesicles remains to be seen . Here , we have not distinguished between the effects of changing cyto - plasmic pH and the effects of changing the luminal pH of the lysosomes themselves . Both may have changed in parallel , so the relevant factor controlling lysosome fusion and fission remains unclear . We could find only two indications in the earlier literature of lysosomal breakup and displacement as extreme as de - scribed here . One was Fig . 1 in reference 20 , where macro - phages were loaded with a relatively high concentration of chlorite - oxidized potato amylose coupled to fluorescein . The other was Fig . 2 c in reference 24 , where ovarian granulosa cells were exposed to acridine orange to label their lyso - somes . Both studies claimed that the peripherally displaced lysosomes moved back to the cell center upon exposure to natural ligands ( the ligands were yeast cells in the case of the macrophages and serum plus LDL in the case of granulosa cells ) . This led the observers to suggest that ligand uptake Figure 9 . Illustration of the pattern of HRP uptake during acetate treatment rather than before . This restricts the tracer to what are considered to be early endosomes ( 14 , 62 ) . These do not display a tendency to collect pe - ripherally nor to move centrally , un - like more " mature " endosomes and lysosomes . Bar , 20 # m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 108 , 1989 862 somehow induced inward lysosomal movements ( 20 , 24 ) . Based on the present observations , it seems equally likely that either or both methods of labeling lysosomes may have inadvertently acidified the cells in question , thereby inducing lysosome dispersion , and that subsequent exposure to natu - ral ligands simply provided sufficient time for recovery of normal cell pH and normal lysosome centralization . There - fore , in future studies of lysosome shape and distribution , it will clearly be important to determine whether changes in cytoplasmic pH and lumenal pH accompany other experi - mental manipulations .
