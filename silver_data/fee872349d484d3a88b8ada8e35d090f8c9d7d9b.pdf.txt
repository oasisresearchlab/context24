Human prostate cancer ( PCa ) and prostate epithelial cells pre - dominantly express estrogen receptor ( ER ) b , but not ER a . ER b might utilize various ER coregulators to mediate the E2 - signaling pathway in PCa . Here , we identiﬁed coiled - coil domain containing 62 ( CCDC62 ) / ERAP75 as a novel ER coactivator . CCDC62 / ERAP75 is widely expressed in PCa cell lines and has low expres - sion in MCF7 cells . Both invitro and invivo interaction assays using mammalian two - hybrid , glutathione S - transferase pull - down and coimmunoprecipitation methods proved that ER b can interact with the C - terminus of CCDC62 / ERAP75 via the ligand - binding domain . The ﬁrst LXXLL motif within CCDC62 / ERAP75 is re - quired for the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that CCDC62 / ERAP75 can be recruited by the estrogen response element – ER complex in the presence of ligand . Furthermore , a chromatin immunoprecip - itation assay demonstrated the hormone - dependent recruitment of CCDC62 / ERAP75 within the promoter of the estrogen - responsive gene cyclin D1 . In addition , using silencing RNA ( siRNA ) against endogeneous CCDC62 / ERAP75 , we demonstrated that inhibition of endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 results in the suppression of ER b - mediated transactivation as well as target gene expression in LNCaP cells . More importantly , using the tet - on overexpression system , we showed that induced expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 can enhance the E2 - regulated cyclin D1 expression and cell growth in LNCaP cells . Together , our results revealed the role of CCDC62 / ERAP75 as a novel coactivator in PCa cells that can modulate ER b transactivation and receptor function . Introduction The estrogen actions are mediated by the estrogen receptors ( ERs ) , members of the nuclear receptor ( NR ) superfamily , which are en - coded by two distinct genes , ER a and ER b ( 1 ) . ERs share a common structural architecture with other NR superfamily members and con - sist of three independent but functionally interactive domains : an N - terminal A / B domain containing a ligand - independent transactiva - tion function ( AF1 ) , a DNA - binding domain ( DBD ) and a C - terminal ligand - binding domain ( LBD ) containing a ligand - dependent trans - activation function ( AF2 ) ( 1 ) . Recent studies have shown that a wide range of ER coregulators can modulate ERs at target promoters ( 2 ) . The most characterized ER coactivators are members of the p160 / steroid receptor coactivator ( SRC ) family including SRC - 1 ( 3 ) , GRIP / TIF2 / NCoA - 2 / SRC - 2 ( 4 , 5 ) and SRC - 3 / AIB1 / pCIP / RAC3 ( 6 – 8 ) . The interaction between ERs and the p160 family is mediated by short amphipathic a - helices , which consist of leucine - rich motifs : LXXLL [ where L is leucine and X is any amino acid ( aa ) ] ( 9 ) . The ligand - activated ERs lead to conformational changes that reposition the Helix 12 and form a hydrophobic groove on the receptor surface and interact with the coactivator LXXLL motif ( 9 , 10 ) . The other important group of ER coactivators is the p300 and the highly related CBP ( 11 , 12 ) , which are histone acetyltransferases that mediate the acetylation of nucleosomal histones . p300 / CBP , as a bridge factor , forms a complex with other coactivators and ERs and cointegrates the signals at distinct steps in ER - mediated transcription activation ( 13 ) . Other coactivators have been suggested to function at different steps by directly binding to the basal transcriptional machinery and promoting the assembly of transcription initiation complexes ( 14 , 15 ) . Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men . An estimated 28 660 men in the USAwill lose their lives because of this malignancy in 2008 ( 16 ) . Estrogens , in combi - nation with androgens , play critical roles in prostate carcinogenesis ( 17 , 18 ) . Recent studies have shown that the ER a gene is transcrip - tionally inactivated by promoter DNA methylation in most PCa cell lines and specimens ( 19 , 20 ) ; therefore , ER b is the predominant ER subtype expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells , PCa cell lines and PCa tissue ( 19 , 21 ) . Although ER b is found lost during the pros - tate cancer initiation , Ho et al . ( 22 ) suggested that re - expression of ER b in metastatic PCa might confer survival advantages to the ad - vanced stage of PCA cells . To elucidate estrogen action in the PCa cells , it is important to understand the ER b - mediated - signaling path - way and the proteins that interact with ER b and might inﬂuence the ER b transactivation and target gene expression . Similar to the positive expression in prostate , ER b is expressed in the human testis tissues ( 23 ) . ER b exists as ﬁve isoforms due to alternative splicing . The current report used the ER b 1 to collect all data . Using the yeast two - hybrid system and ER b 1 - LBD as bait , we screened a human testis complementary DNA ( cDNA ) library and identiﬁed an unreported ER - associated protein , designated ERAP75 ( ER - associated protein with a predicted molecular mass of 75 kDa ) ( 24 ) . The sequence blast research revealed that ERAP75 matched the sequence encoding the Homo sapiens coiled - coil domain containing 62 ( CCDC62 ) protein . There was no reported function for the CCDC62 before we identiﬁed and characterized it as an ER - interact - ing protein and a coactivator to modulate ER a function in the prostate stromal cells ( 24 ) . In the current study , we unify the nomenclature as CCDC62 / ERAP75 . The coiled - coil domain in the CCDC62 / ERAP75 , consisting of two to ﬁve amphipathic a - helices that wind around one another into a superhelix , is expected to fulﬁll a function in protein – protein interactions , DNA – protein interactions and dimerization ( 25 ) . We showed that CCDC62 / ERAP75 is widely expressed in the normal prostate epithelial cells and PCa cell lines . Since most PCa cell lines express ER b , we decided to use the human PCa epithelial cells to further elucidate the possible roles of CCDC62 / ERAP75 involved in the ER b - mediated - signaling pathways . Here , we demonstrate that CCDC62 / ERAP75 functions as an ER b coactviator to enhance ER b - mediated transactivation , target genes expression and cell growth in the PCa epithelial cells .

Site - directed mutagenesis on lysine residues of ‘LXXLL’ motifs in the plasmid pGEX - CCDC62 / ERAP75 or pVP16 - CCDC62 / ERAP75 was performed using the QuikChange XL site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) follow - ing the manufacturer’s protocol . Replacement of lysine residues with alanine was made by using mutagenic primers . All the plasmids , after construction , were veriﬁed by sequencing . The expression of plasmids was either conﬁrmed by TNT TM in vitro expression or western blotting . Antibodies Cyclin D1 and b - actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech - nology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . ER b antibody ( 06 - 629 ) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ) , and anti - Flag antibody M2 was purchased from ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . CCDC62 / ERAP75 monoclonal antibody was produced by injecting the puriﬁed human CCDC62 / ERAP75 - carboxyl termi - nus ( 338 – 684 aa ) antigen into a mouse , and the antigen puriﬁed as described previously ( 27 ) . Yeast two - hybrid system The LBD of ER b 1 ( b 1 isoform ) cDNA ( 233 – 530 aa ) was cloned into the Eco RI and Bam HI enzyme sites in the pGBKT7 vector ( Clontech ) . Yeast strain AH109 was transformed with the plasmid pGBKT7 - ER b - LBD encoding the Gal4DBD - ER b - LBD fusion protein . Transformed AH109 was then mated with yeast strain Y187 that had been pretransformed with the human testis MATCH - MAKER cDNA library ( Clontech ) . The library was screened following the man - ufacturer’s protocol . The detailed method has been described previously ( 28 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation assays and western blotting LNCaP cells were seeded on 10 cm diameter cell culture dishes and treated with vehicle ( 0 . 01 % ethanol ) or 10 nM E2 for 24 h in 10 % charcoal - dextran ( CD ) - fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) phenol red - free media . The cells were then lysed using lysisbuffer ( 1 % NP - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 135 mMNaCl , 40mMTris / pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail ) ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) in the presence or absence of E2 . Lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were precipitated by 2 l g anti - ER b antibody or normal mouse IgG for 4 h at 4 (cid:2) C with agitation followed by adding 40 l l protein A / G plus agarose for another 2 h . Lysates were centrifuged , the immu - noprecipitates were washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline and re - solved on a 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel , and results were analyzed by western blotting as described previously ( 27 ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay LNCaP cells were grown in phenol red - free RPMI supplemented with 10 % CD - FBS for 24 h and then incubated in fresh medium without or with 10 nM E2 for 3 h . Cells were cross - linked with 1 % formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and lysed with lysis buffer . Sonication was performed to shear DNA to 200 – 1000 bp , cell debris was pelleted and supernatants were collected and diluted with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay ( ChIP ) dilution buffer . To preclear , diluted samples were incubated with salmon sperm DNA / protein A agarose slurry with rotation for 1 h at 4 (cid:2) C . The beads were then pelleted and the supernatants were collected . Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 (cid:2) C overnight with 2 l g CCDC62 / ERAP75 monoclonal antibody ; immunoprecipi - tates were then sequentially washed with immune complex wash buffers con - taining low salt , high salt and lithium chloride followed by two washes with Tris – ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer . DNA associated with immuno - precipitation was eluted with fresh elution buffer . The cross - linking was re - versed by the addition of 1 / 25 volume of 5 M NaCl followed by incubation at 65 (cid:2) C for 6 h . The DNA was recovered with a QIAGEN PCR cleaning kit and 1 l l eluate was subjected to PCR and real - time PCR . The primers used for the region encompassing the activity protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) site were as described previously ( 29 ) . siRNA and retrovirus infection experiment CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA target was designed using OligoEngine siRNA de - sign software . The targeted sequences were analyzed by BLAST search to eliminate any signiﬁcant sequence homology with other genes . The Superior . - retro . puro vector ( OligoEngine , Seattle , WA ) was used for the expression of siRNA in LNCaP cells . The speciﬁc CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA insert was GTGAGCTAATTGCCATCCA . A scramble negative control siRNA was con - structed using an insert : GTTGACACGCCTGTACTAA , which contains nu - cleotide substitutions at the 19 nt - targeting sequence and with no signiﬁcant homology to any mammalian gene sequence . CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA or scrambled siRNA was transfected using SuperFect reagent ( Qiagen , Chats - worth , CA ) into Phoenix packaging cells ( the Nolan Lab , Stanford University ) . LNCaP cells were then cultured in the presence of the viral supernatant and selected with 1 l g / ml puromycin ( Sigma ) for 5 – 7 days . After the selection , the cells were cultured in 10 % CD - FBS media and treated with 10 nM E2 for 24 h before luciferase reporter assay or real - time PCR . Cell proliferation assay The LNCaP cells were seeded into 24 - well plates in medium containing 5 % CD - FBS . After 24 h doxycycline ( Dox ) ( 2 l g / ml ) treatment , 10 nM E2 was added to the cells , medium was replenished and cell proliferation was determinedby3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazole - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - biphenyltetrazoliumbromide assay at the indicated time points as described previously ( 27 ) . Brieﬂy , 0 . 5 ml 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazole - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - biphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) was added into each well . After 2 – 3 h incubation at 37 (cid:2) C , 1 ml 0 . 04 M HCl in isopropyl alcohol was added to solubilize the formazan product and the absorbance recorded at a wavelength of 595 nm . The experiment was per - formed in triplicate . Statistical analysis The statistical analyses were done using the Student’s t - test . P values , 0 . 05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant . Results Ligand - dependent interaction of ERs and CCDC62 / ERAP75 in yeast In order to identify the novel proteins interacting with ER b , the hu - man ER b - LBD ( 233 – 530 aa ) was fused with the Gal4DBD as bait in yeast two - hybrid screening . A pretransformed normal human testis cDNA library was screened in the presence of 10 nM E2 . A total of 26 individual yeast clones were ﬁrst identiﬁed by nutrition deprivation and the interaction with ER b - LBD conﬁrmed by a clone lift assay ( data not shown ) . Sequence analyses found that a few clones encode SRC - 1 ( data not shown ) . Two positive cDNA clones were identical and encoded 85 aa followed by a 1 kb 3 # untranslated region , which matched the CCDC62 / ERAP75 sequence deposited in the DDBJ / EMBL / GenBank database ( accession no . : NM _ 201435 ) . This CCDC62 / ERAP75 fragment ( aa 600 – 684 ; CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C ) from yeast lies in the C - terminus of CCDC62 / ERAP75 and contains two conserved LXXLL motifs . Using 5 # rapid ampliﬁcation of cDNA ends PCR method , we determinedand cloned the full - length cDNA sequence ofthistranscriptthatcontains3044ntandencodesanopenreadingframeof684aawithapredictedmolecularweightof75kDa . Two putative coiled - coildomainsexistintheNterminusofCCDC62 / ERAP75protein ( aa16 – 163andaa199 – 255 ) . Cotransformationofthebait vectorand the candidate clones or SRC - 1 clones into the yeast strain AH109 , followed by growth selection and a - galactosidase assay ( X - a - gal as substrate ) , further conﬁrmed the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C or SRC - 1 ( Figure 1A ) . Next , we applied the liquid b - galactosidase assays to quantify the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C . Constructs containing either CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C or SRC - 1 showed a strong and similar interaction with the ER b in a ligand - dependent manner ( Figure 1B , lanes 5 (cid:2) 8 ) . There was no autologous transactiva - tion activity detectable when transfecting GalAD - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C with GalDBD ( Figure 1B , lane 4 versus 3 ) . Distribution of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in human cell lines and mouse tissues To detect the expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in different cell lines , western blotting was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C antigen ( aa 338 – 684 ) . We ﬁrst validated CCDC62 / ERAP75 antibody by immunoblotting CCDC62 / ERAP75 protein in COS - 1 cells transfected with CCDC62 / ERAP75 , LNCaP cells and COS - 1 parental cells with or without neutralizing antigen . As shown in the Figure 2A , the speciﬁc band was abolished after antigen neutralization , which indicated the band identiﬁed is , in fact , CCDC62 / ERAP75 . The CCDC62 / ERAP75 protein was detect - able in most of the cell lines tested with the highest expression levels in DU145 , PC3 and 22Rv1 cell lines , moderate expression in LNCaP , M . Chen et al . 842 BPH - 1 and H1299 cells , low expression in MCF7 cells and almost undetectable expression in the COS - 1 cells ( Figure 2B ) . Among these cell lines , LNCaP , PC - 3 , DU145 and 22Rv1 are human PCa cells , the BPH - 1 cells are human prostate benign epithelial cells immortalized by SV - 40 antigens , MCF - 7 is a human breast cancer cell line , H1299 is a human lung cancer cell line and COS - 1 cells are from African green monkey kidney cells immortalized by SV - 40 antigens . We also detected ER b expression in those cell lines but not ER a as ER a is transcriptionally inactivated by promoter DNA methylation in most PCa cell lines and specimens ( 19 , 20 ) . The results showed that ER b is expressed in a benign prostate epithelial cell line BPH - 1 and PCa cell lines , LNCaP and DU145 cells at comparable level with MCF7 . Although a previous study showed that ER b messenger RNA can be detected in PC3 cells ( 19 ) , our result indicated that ER b protein is expressed at a low and barely detectable level in PC3 cells . We further tested the mouse CCDC62 / ERAP75 ( Gene ID : 208908 ) expression in a 2 - month - old C57BL / 6 mouse using semiquantative reverse tran - scriptase – PCR . We found that CCDC62 / ERAP75 was widely ex - pressed in multiple mouse tissues at variable levels . Strong expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 transcripts was seen in testis , mod - erate expression in epididymis , prostate , heart , lung and kidney , whereas very low expression levels were detected in other tissues ( Figure 2C ) . Using immunoﬂuorescence staining , we found that in the LNCaP cells , both ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 mainly express in the nucleus in the absence or presence of E2 ( Figure 2D ) . After merging , the colocalization of ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 can be revealed in the nuclei of LNCaP cells . We also examined CCDC62 / ERAP75 expression in the normal human prostate tissue via immu - nohistochemistry ( IHC ) staining . CCDC62 / ERAP75 was expressed in the nuclei of both prostatic epithelial cells ( arrows , Figure 2E ) and stromal cells ( arrowheads , Figure 2E ) , but predominantly expressed in the prostatic epithelial cells . Overall , CCDC62 / ERAP75 is expressed in the human normal prostate , PCa cell lines and the mouse prostate and is primarily present in the cell nucleus . Interaction of CCDC62 / ERAP75 and ER b in vitro and in vivo To further conﬁrm the interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 and ER b from yeast two - hybrid screening , we examined the interaction using both in vitro and in vivo assays . In mammalian two - hybrid assays , the interaction between GalDBD - ER b - LBD and VP16 - AD - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C or VP16 - AD - CCDC62 / ERAP75 ( Figure 3A , lanes 4 and 5 ) can be detected in the presence of E2 . Furthermore , ICI182 , 780 , a pure antagonist of E2 , abolished the E2 - induced interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 . Similar to the results from yeast two - hybrid assay , there was no autologous transactivation activity detectable when transfecting VP16 - AD - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C or VP16 - AD - CCDC62 / ERAP75 with GalDBD ( Figure 3A , lanes 2 and 3 ) . The as - sociation of the CCDC62 / ERAP75 protein with ER b was also tested by in vitro coimmunoprecipitation . The [ 35 S ] methionine - labeled ER b - LBD and HA - fused CCDC62 / ERAP75 were transcribed and translated invitro , separately . After interacting with HA - fused CCDC62 / ERAP75 , ER b - LBD was precipitated by an anti - HA antibody in the presence of E2 ( Figure 3B , lane 5 ) . The interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 was also conﬁrmed by coimmunoprecipitation from protein extracts prepared from LNCaP cells . We demonstrated that endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 in LNCaP cells could be coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous ER b using the anti - ER b antibody ( Figure 3C ) . To - gether , results from mammalian two - hybrid assay as well as in vitro and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CCDC62 / ERAP75 could interact with ER b in a ligand - dependent manner . Recruitment of CCDC62 / ERAP75 by ERE - ER b in the presence of ligand ERs bind to ERE with high afﬁnity and transactivate gene expression in response to estrogen . We examined whether CCDC62 / ERAP75 can be recruited by the ERE – ER complex . Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) assay as shown in Figure 3D , ER b bound with ERE both in the absence or presence of E2 in vitro ( Figure 3D , lanes 3 , 7 and 8 ) and the ERE – ER complex was supershifted by ER b antibody ( Fig - ure 3D , lane 4 ) . The addition of a 100 - fold molar excess unlabeled ERE could effectively eliminate ERE – ER complex formation ( Figure 3D , lane 5 ) . In contrast , the excess unlabeled mutant ERE did not affect the complex formation ( Figure 3D , lane 6 ) , which proved that the ERE – ER complex ( arrow ) has speciﬁc binding between ER b and ERE probe . CCDC62 / ERAP75 did not autologously bind with ERE ( Figure 3D , lane 2 ) . In the presence of E2 , recruitment of CCDC62 / ERAP75 re - sulted in the ERE - bound receptor with slowed migration ( Figure 3D , lane 10 ) . Addition of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the absence of E2 did not supershift the ERE – ER b complex ( Figure 3D , lane 9 ) , conﬁrming that the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 is ligand depen - dent . The excess unlabeled ERE could effectively eliminate ERE – ER b complex formation so that ERE – ER b - CCDC62 / ERAP75 complex was completely abolished ( Figure 3D , lane 11 ) , whereas ERE – ER b - CCDC62 / ERAP75 complex was not affected by the presence of excess mutant ERE ( Figure 3D , lane 12 ) . Together , CCDC62 / ERAP75 can be recruited by the ERE – ER b complex in vitro in the presence of ligand . CCDC62 / ERAP75 is recruited to the AP - 1 site of cyclin D1 promoter in the presence of estrogen ERs can also tether with other transcription factors to form the trans - activation complexes where ERs interact with another DNA - bound transcription factor to stabilize the DNA binding of that transcription factor and recruit coactivators to the complexes and regulate the target Fig . 1 . Isolation of CCDC62 / ERAP75 as an ER b - associated protein using yeast two - hybrid assay . ( A and B ) The interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C and ER b - LBD was conﬁrmed by cotransformation of AH109 yeast cells with GalDBD - ER b - LBD and GalAD - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C grown on the - Leu / - Trp / - His / - Ade selection media supplemented with X - a - gal in the presence of 10 nM E2 ( A ) or grown in the liquid selection media in the presence or absence of 10 nM E2 . The interaction was quantiﬁed by b - galactosidase activity in the yeast cells ( B ) . SRC - 1 was used as a positive control for the interaction with ER b . CCDC62 / ERA75 as a coactivator 843 Fig . 2 . CCDC62 / ERAP75 expression in different human cancer cell lines and various mouse tissues . ( A ) The validation of CCDC62 / ERAP75 monoclonal antibody . The lysates from COS - 1 transfected with CCDC62 / ERAP75 , LNCaP cells and COS - 1 parental cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with CCDC62 / ERAP75 monoclonal antibody without ( lanes 1 – 3 ) or with ( lanes 4 – 6 ) 10 l g His - CCDC62 / ERAP75 antigen ( aa 338 – 684 ) competing peptide . Note that after antigen neutralization , the 75 kDa speciﬁc bands were abolished . The glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) was used to demonstrate equal loading of protein amounts . ( B ) Western blotting detection of CCDC62 / ERAP75 and ER b protein in different cell lines . The b - actin was used to demonstrate equal loading of protein amounts . ( C ) Semiquantitative reverse transcription – PCR for CCDC62 / ERAP75 messenger RNA in different tissues of a 2 - month - old C57BL / 6 male mouse . We used 3 l g total RNA to generate ﬁrst - strand cDNA and then used gene - speciﬁc primers to amplify the gene CCDC62 / ERAP75 . The mouse CCDC62 / ERAP75 shared 50 % homology with human CCDC62 / ERAP75 . ( D ) M . Chen et al . 844 gene expression in the context of the native chromatin ( 30 ) . To assess if CCDC62 / ERAP75 is assembled into transactivation com - plexes bound to ERs , we used the ChIP assay to examine the estro - gen - responsive cyclin D1 promoter in LNCaP cells . The estrogen - responsive cyclin D1 expression is mediated by ERs through the AP - 1 promoter , not the ERE sequence ( 29 , 33 ) . During the ChIP anal - yses , LNCaP was treated with or without 10 nM E2 for 3 h and native chromatin - associated protein complexes were cross - linked to the DNA . The ChIP analyses were carried out with IgG ( negative control ) or anti - CCDC62 / ERAP75 antibody . As shown in Figure 3E , in the presence of E2 , anti - CCDC62 / ERAP75 , but not the preimmune ChIP , reveals (cid:3) 7 - fold recovery of cyclin D1 promoter ampliﬁcation product ( Figure 3E , lower panel , E2 : EtOH 5 13 . 4 versus 1 . 9 , input as 100 ) indicating that CCDC62 / ERAP75 becomes associated with the ER b at the cyclin D1 promoter in a ligand - dependent manner . The results are speciﬁc because estrogen induces the occupancy of cyclin D1 promoter by ER b at the same site ( data not shown ) . There is no speciﬁc band ampliﬁed while using a distal promoter sequence of cyclin D1 as the control , which does not contain an AP - 1 or ERE regulatory element ( data not shown ) . Overall , these results demon - strate that CCDC62 / ERAP75 can interact with ER b and is one of the components of the ER transactivation complexes bound to ER native target genes . Domains involved in the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 Since the initially isolated CCDC62 / ERAP75 clones only encoded the C - terminus of CCDC62 / ERAP75 , we examined whether the C - terminus in the CCDC62 / ERAP75 was responsible for interacting with ER b and determined which domains of ER b might be responsi - ble for this interaction . To dissect the CCDC62 / ERAP75 interaction domain on the ER b , four ER mutants fused with GST were tested in GST pull - down assays . As shown in Figure 4A , GST - ER b - LBD , but not GST - ER b - N , GST - ER b - DBD or GST - ER b - AF2 domain can in - teract with CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the presence of E2 . This indicates that ER b - LBD in the ER b protein is responsible for the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 . On the other hand , three GST - fused CCDC62 / ERAP75 mutants : GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - N ( aa 1 – 180 , containing the ﬁrst coiled coil ) , GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - M ( aa 180 – 498 , containing the second coiled coil ) and GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C ( aa 498 – 684 , containing the LXXLL motif ) were used to determine which domain of CCDC62 / ERAP75 interacted with the ER b protein . As shown in Figure 4B , GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C , but not GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - N or - M , is responsible for binding to ER b in the presence of E2 . Together , those results are consistent with the studies from yeast two - hybrid screening . The LXXLL motif is required for the interaction between ER and CCDC62 / ERAP75 LXXLL is a conserved motif present in the NRs coactivators and is necessary and sufﬁcient to mediate binding of the coactivators to liganded NRs ( 9 ) . The LXXLL motifs individually are able and suf - ﬁcient to bind to hormone receptors , but display preferences for cer - tain receptors ( 32 ) . However , in other coactivators , such as PRIP , not all the LXXLL motifs are necessary to mediate the interaction be - tween coactivators and their receptors ( 33 ) . Since the CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C contains two LXXLL motifs , we investigated whether both LXXLL motifs are required for the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 . CCDC62 / ERAP75 mutants of the LXXLL motifs were tested in a GST pull - down assay ( Figure 4C ) . The results showed that if the mutation occurred in the ﬁrst LXXLL motif , the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 was abolished . In contrast , when the second LXXLL motif of CCDC62 / ERAP75 was mutated , there was no alteration on its interaction with ER b ( Figure 4C ) . We also tested the interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 mutants and ER b in a mammalian two - hybrid assay . Similarly , the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 was reduced around 70 % when the ﬁrst LXXLL motif was mutated in the two - hybrid assay ( Figure 4D , lane 7 versus 4 ) . There is no change on the in - teraction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 when the second LXXLL motif is mutated ( Figure 4D , lane 10 versus 4 ) . These results suggested that the ﬁrst LXXLL motif is critical to mediate the in - teraction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 and ER b . CCDC62 / ERAP75 enhances the ER transactivation activity To determine whether the interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 and ER b affects the ER b transactivation activity , we used luciferase as - says with ERE - luc reporter genes . In the COS - 1 cell line , which has abarelydetectableCCDC62 / ERAP75expression ( Figure 2A ) , E2 treat - ment led to a 4 - fold increase in the ER b transactivation ( Figure 5A , lane 3 versus 1 ) . Importantly , addition of CCDC62 / ERAP75 led to a substantial , CCDC62 / ERAP75 dose - dependent increase in E2 - induced ER b transactivation in COS - 1 cells ( Figure 5A , lanes 4 – 7 ver - sus 3 ) . For a comparison , we also tested the inﬂuence of CCDC62 / ERAP75 on ER a transactivation . As shown in Figure 5A , CCDC62 / ERAP75wasalsoabletoenhanceER a - mediatedtransactivation ( Figure 5A , lane 13 versus 10 ) . Similar activation was also observed when we replaced COS - 1 cells with H1299 and LNCaP cells ( data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that CCDC62 / ERAP75 can function as a co - activator to mediate ERs transcriptional activation . A comparison of CCDC62 / ERAP75 effect on different NRs trans - activation was performed in the COS - 1 cells . When transfected with 0 . 7 l g coactivator , CCDC62 / ERAP75 showed the most signiﬁcant activa - tion of ER b transactivation ( Figure 5A , lane 7 versus 3 ) , compared with the moderate activation of progesterone receptor , glucocorticoid recep - tor and androgen receptor ( AR ) ( Figure 5B , lane 4 versus 3 ; lane 8 versus 7 and lane 12 versus 11 , respectively ) , and little effect on vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) transactivation ( Figure 5B , lane 16 versus 15 ) . These results suggested that the CCDC62 / ERAP75 has a prefer - ence in transactivation of various NRs . Knockdown of the endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 expression by siRNA - suppressed ER b transactivation and target genes expression In order to rule out the artiﬁcial effect linked with luciferase reporter assays and demonstrate that the endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 can function as an ER b coactivator , we established LNCaP cells stably expressing CCDC62 / ERAP75 or scramble siRNA . As shown in Fig - ure 5C and D , endogeneous CCDC62 / ERAP75 expression was re - duced . 80 % by CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA as demonstrated in both real - time reverse transcription – PCR and western blot assay . Notably , ER transactivation was decreased when the endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 was suppressed ( Figure 5E ) . To further conﬁrm the roles of endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 in ER b function , we examined the messenger RNA expression of ER target genes ( pS2 , cathepsin D , cyclin D1 and TERT ) in LNCaP cells upon knockdown of endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 gene expression by real - time PCR . As shown in Figure 5F , E2 cannot regulate the expression of pS2 and cathepsin D in LNCaP cells , but can induce the expression of cyclin D1 and TERT expression . Signiﬁcantly , the induction of the messenger RNA ex - pression of cyclin D1 and TERT was reduced upon transfection of CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA2 ( Figure 5F , lane 12 versus 10 ; lane 16 versus 14 , P , 0 . 05 ) . These results conﬁrmed the activator role of endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 in E2 - mediated transactivation and tar - get gene expression in LNCaP cells . Immunoﬂuorescence localization of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the LNCaP cells . LNCaP cells were treated with 10 nM E2 or solvent ( 0 . 01 % ethanol ) for 24 h . Immunoﬂuorescence staining was performed as described in Materials and Methods . ( E ) IHC analyses of CCDC62 / ERAP75 protein in the non - malignant human prostate tissues . CCDC62 / ERAP75 was expressed in the nuclei of both prostatic epithelial ( arrows ) and stromal cells ( arrowheads ) , with predominant expression in the prostatic epithelial cells . CCDC62 / ERA75 as a coactivator 845 Increase of ER b target gene expression and estrogen - mediated cell growth in LNCaP cells with Dox - induced CCDC62 / ERAP75 We studied the consequence of CCDC62 / ERAP75 as a coactivator to enhance the ER b transactivation in the cell proliferation assay . We constructed a Dox - inducible CCDC62 / ERAP75 stable LNCaP cell line ( LNCaP - ﬂag - CCDC62 / ERAP75 ) . As shown in Figure 6A , addi - tion of 2 l g / ml Dox induced ﬂag - CCDC62 / ERAP75 expression in LNCaP - CCDC62 / ERAP75 cells as detected by anti - ﬂag antibody . The induction of CCDC62 / ERAP75 could then enhance the expres - sion of ER b endogenous target gene , cyclin D1 , after 24 h E2 treat - ment in LNCaP cells ( Figure 6B , lane 8 versus 4 and 7 ) , but had no inﬂuence on the b - actin gene expression . In contrast , addition of Dox in control LNCaP - vector cells , stably transfected with parental vector pRev - TRE , showed little or no inﬂuence on the cyclin D1 expression ( Figure 6B , lane 4 versus 3 ) . We then studied the consequence of activation of ER b transactivation and target genes expression by CCDC62 / ERAP75 via the cell proliferation assay . LNCaP cell growth was signiﬁcantly stimulated by E2 treatment ( Figure 6C ) . After Fig . 3 . CCDC62 / ERAP75 could interact with ER b both in vitro and in vivo . ( A ) Interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 was examined by mammalian two - hybrid assays . A total of 0 . 3 l g each of pM , pVP16 , pVP16 - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C and pVP16 - CCDC62 / ERAP75 were cotransformed into COS - 1 cells in the combinations shown . The luciferase activity of the reporter , 0 . 4 l g of pG5 - Luc , was normalized by the luciferase activity of 5 ng of internal control , pRL - TK . The relative reporter gene activity was compared by setting the luciferase activity of the vector alone in absence of E2 as 1 . ( B ) In vitro coimmunoprecipitation of HA - CCDC62 / ERAP75 with ER b proteins . A total of 5 l l invitro translated HA - CCDC62 / ERAP75 and ER b or 5 l l invitro translated ER b alonewere incubated at 4 (cid:2) C in presence or absence of 10 nM E2 . The proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA antibody and analyzed on a 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ± polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel . A total of 0 . 5 l l invitro translated ER b protein was loaded onto the gel as a marker . ( C ) In vivo coimmunoprecipitation of CCDC62 / ERAP75 with ER b . Lysates were prepared from LNCaP cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with an anti - ER b antibody followed by anti - CCDC62 / ERAP75 or anti - ER b immunoblotting . ( D ) CCDC62 / ERAP75 interacts with ER b - bound ERE using EMSA . A palindromic ERE oligonucleotide was used as the DNA probe for ER : sense , 5 # - GATCTCTTTGATCAGGTCACTGTGACCTGACTTTG - 3 # ; antisense : 5 # - CAAAGTCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGAT CAAAGAGATC - 3 # . The mutant ERE probewas generated by mutating the ERE half site : sense , 5 # - GATCTCTTTGATCAGTACACTGTGACCTGACTTTG - 3 # ; antisense : 5 # - CAAAGTCAGGTCACAGTGTACTGATCAAAGAGATC - 3 # . ER b protein was synthesized by in vitro transcription / translation reaction and incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nM E2 followed by mixing with 32 P end - labeled ERE and 500 ng puriﬁed GSTor GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 - C ( aa 496 – 684 ) protein ( lanes 9 – 12 ) . A total of 1 l l anti - ER b antibody was added for protein supershift ( lane 4 ) . A 100 - fold molar excess of unlabeled ERE or mutant ERE was used as cold competitor ( lanes 5 , 6 , 11 and 12 ) . Samples were resolved on 5 % non - denaturing gel . The arrow indicates ERE – ER b complex and arrowhead indicates ERE – ER b - CCDC62 / ERAP75 complex . ( E ) Estrogen induces the binding of CCDC62 / ERAP75 with ER b at the AP - 1 site of cyclin D1 promoter . LNCaP cells were treated with 10 nM E2 for 3 h in CD - FBS media . The binding of CCDC62 / ERAP75 with ER b on the cyclin D1 gene promoter was measured by ChIP experiments with CCDC62 / ERAP75 - speciﬁc antibody . PCR ampliﬁcation of the cyclin D1 promoter ( (cid:2) 1039 to (cid:2) 720 ) that includes the region containing AP - 1 site ( upper panel ) . The real - time PCR was used to quantify the occupancy for the ChIP assay ( lower panel ) . The occupancy in the input control was set at 100 % . For the negative control , we used the 5 # upstream region ( (cid:2) 3187 to (cid:2) 2931 ) ( data not shown ) . E2 does not induce the binding of CCDC62 / ERAP75 with ER on the distal region of cyclin D1 gene promoter . M . Chen et al . 846 Dox - induced CCDC62 / ERAP75 expression , E2 - stimulated LNCaP cell growth was further enhanced ( Figure 6C ) . Although the cell pro - liferation slowed down at day 7 , our data suggested that higher expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 could potentiate cell growth and survival . Together , these results extended our in vitro studies and demonstrated that the consequence of the protein – protein interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 can result in the ER b target gene expression and enhance E2 / ER b - stimulated cell growth in LNCaP PCa cells . Discussion Using the yeast two - hybrid assay with ER b 1 - LBD as bait to screen a human testis cDNA library , we identiﬁed CCDC62 / ERAP75 as a new ER coactivator that reveals a strong ligand and LBD - dependent interaction with ER b ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . Analysis of the genome se - quence showed that CCDC62 / ERAP75 gene consists of 13 exons and transcribes different alternative splicing transcripts . There are two similar transcripts , CCDC62 / ERAP75 transcript 1 ( NM _ 032573 ) and transcript 2 ( NM _ 201435 ) . The difference between transcript 1 and transcript 2 lies in the C - terminal exon 12 , which encodes the last 15 aa for the transcript 2 and the last 12 aa for the transcript 1 . All the other coding regions are identical . The CCDC62 / ERAP75 identiﬁed in our yeast two - hybrid screening was the C - terminus of transcript 2 ( NM _ 201435 ) , but not transcript 1 ( NM _ 032573 ) . We acknowledge that transcript 1 could also potentially interact with ER bait . The reason that we did not identify the transcript 1 as the ER interaction protein could be due to the different abundance of these splice variants in the library . Our studies also showed that CCDC62 / ERAP75 protein is mainly present in the nucleus and widely expressed in many PCa cell lines ( Figure 2 ) . Coactivators are generally expressed in a variety of tissues and important for modulating the NRs transactivation and physiolog - ical function ( 34 ) ; however , individual coactivators have a tissue - spe - ciﬁc expression pattern ( 35 ) . The higher expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the PCa cells might suggest that it is important for the ER b - signaling regulation in PCa cells . Therefore , we focused on characterization of CCDC62 / ERAP75 function in PCa cells . In the human tumor specimens , the ampliﬁcation of coactivators is frequently observed , which may contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer . For example , SRC3 / RAC3 / AIB1 is often overexpressed in steroid - regulated tumors , especially in breast , ovarian and PCa ( 7 ) . We examined the expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in several commonly used PCa cell lines . CCDC62 / ERAP75 is expressed more abundantly in the PCa cells ( PC3 , DU145 , LNCaP , 22Rv1 ) than in the normal prostate epithelial cells ( BPH - 1 ) . Recent studies have shown re - expression of high level ER b in the majority of cases of PCa metastasized to bone and lymph node with little or no ER a expression ( 21 ) . Whether the expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 correlates with the ER b expression in the PCa tissue is currently unknown . Further stud - ies are needed to determine the functional role of CCDC62 / ERAP75 Fig . 4 . Mapping the interaction domains between the ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 and determining the LXXLL motif required for the interaction between ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 . ( A ) The construction of GST - ER b fragments is illustrated schematically . GSTalone and different GST - ER b fusion proteins were bound to glutathione - Sepharose beads and incubated with 5 l l [ 35 S ] methionine - labeled CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the absence or presence of 100 nM E2 . After extensive washing , bead - bound protein complexes were loaded onto 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) ( lower panel ) . ( B ) Schematic representation of GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 constructs . GST or three GST - CCDC62 / ERAP75 fusion proteins were bound to glutathione - Sepharose beads and incubated with 5 l l [ 35 S ] methionine - labeled ER b in a pull - down assay ( lower panel ) . The input represents 10 % of the [ 35 S ] methionine - labeled proteins used in each pull - down assay . ( C ) Schematic diagram of the CCDC62 / ERAP75 putative NR boxes , the strategy of mutation and in vitro interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 mutants and ER b . The GST alone and the different CCDC62 / ERAP75 mutants were puriﬁed and incubated with [ 35 S ] methionine - labeled ER b and analyzed in a pull - down assay in the absence or presence of 100 nM E2 . ( D ) Mammalian two - hybrid interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 mutants and ER b . COS - 1 cells were transiently transfected with 0 . 4 l g pG5 - Luc , 0 . 3 l g GalDBD - ER b - LBD and 0 . 3 l g VP16 - AD or different VP16 - AD - CCDC62 / ERAP75 mutants as indicated . The luciferase activity was measured in the absence or presence of 10 nM E2 with or without 1 l M ICI - 182 , 780 . The luciferase activity observed with wild - type CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the presence of E2 was set at 100 % . CCDC62 / ERA75 as a coactivator 847 in the PCa and whether this gene is also ampliﬁed and overexpressed in certain stages of PCa development . CCDC62 / ERAP75 contains two LXXLL motifs , which have been shown to be necessary and sufﬁcient to mediate binding of the coac - tivators to liganded NRs ( 9 ) . However , we found that only the ﬁrst LXXLL motif , located at residues 634 – 638 , is necessary for the in - teraction of CCDC62 / ERAP75 with the ER b . A mutation in the sec - ond LXXLL motif does not affect the interaction with or inﬂuence the coactivation of ER b ( see supplementary data and Figure S - 1 available at Carcinogenesis Online ) . Detailed studies on residues ﬂanking the second LXXLL motif and its secondary structure in this context are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which this motif is unable to interact with ER b . In CCDC62 / ERAP75 , we found that there are two potential coiled - coil domains at the N terminus , which have been known to fulﬁll a function in protein – protein interactions , DNA – protein interactions and dimerization ( 25 ) . A coiled - coil domain has also been detected in CoCoA and AINT , two other NR coactivators ( 36 , 37 ) . Interestingly , this coiled - coil domain has been suggested to mediate the interaction between the bHLH - PAS domain of p160 co - activator and its coactivators , such as CoCoA . Although our studies have shown that the coiled - coil domain in the CCDC62 / ERAP75 is not necessary to mediate the interaction with ER b , it is possible that the coiled - coil domain might facilitate the interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 and p160 coactivators . Fig . 5 . The effect of CCDC62 / ERAP75 on the ERs and other NRs transactivation and inhibition of the coactivator function of endogeneous CCDC62 / ERAP75 on ER b transactivation and target gene expressionvia knockdown of CCDC62 / ERAP75 . ( A and B ) COS - 1 cells were cotransfected with 100 ng of pSG5 - ER a , pSG5 - ER b , pSG5 - AR , pSG5 - PR , pSG5 - GR and pSG5 - VDR , different doses of pSG5 - CCDC62 / ERAP75 or pSG5 vector ( l g , as shown ) and 400 ng of reporter plasmid for individual NR . ERE - Luc was used as the reporter for ER ; MMTV - Luc was used as the reporter for AR , progesterone receptor ( PR ) and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and CYP24 - Luc was used as the reporter for VDR . The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding the varying amounts of empty expression plasmids . Each receptor group was treated with the cognate ligand or vehicle as shown for 24 h and then assayed for luciferase activity ; 5 ng of pRL - TK was used as the internal control . Results shown are the means ± SD from three independent experiments . ( C ) Expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 by real - time reverse transcription – PCR in the LNCaP cells stably expressing scramble or CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA . Stable LNCaP cells were harvested , total RNAwas extracted and real - time reverse transcription – PCR was used to assay the relative expression level of CCDC62 / ERAP75 messenger RNA in the cells . ( D ) Expression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 protein in the LNCaP cells stably expressing scramble or CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA . ( E ) The LNCaP cells stably expressing scramble or CCDC62 / ERAP75 siRNA were subcultured into 24 - well plates in phenol red - free CD - FBS media and then transfected with 0 . 2 l g ERE - Luc and 2 ng pRL - TK internal control plasmid for 24 h followed by treatment with ethanol or 10 nM E2 . Activities of pRL - TK were used to normalize transfection efﬁciency . Results shown are the means ± SDs from three independent experiments . ( F ) The stable LNCaP siRNA cells were subcultured into 100 cm culture dishes in phenol red - free CD - FBS media followed by vehicle or 10 nM E2 treatments for 24 h . The cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted . Real - time PCR was used to detect gene expression with gene - speciﬁc primers . b - Actin served as an internal control . The data are presented as mean value ± SD of triplicate samples . Columns , mean ; bars , SD . (cid:1) P , 0 . 05 compared with scramble siRNA E2 treatment , Student’s t - test . M . Chen et al . 848 Using ERE - luc reporter assay , we found that CCDC62 / ERAP75 can enhance ER a transactivation to a level similar to that of ER b transactivation , which suggests that the interaction between CCDC62 / ERAP75 and ERs is highly conserved in the context of the ERE promoter . Although certain coactivators have shown a pref - erence when transactivating ER a versus ER b ( 38 ) , we did not observe any differential effect of CCDC62 / ERAP75 on ERs transactivation ; however , CCDC62 / ERAP75 can moderately enhance progesterone receptor , glucocorticoid receptor and AR transactivation , but has very little effect on VDR transactivation . The selective effect of CCDC62 / ERAP75 on NRs transactivation might implicate the relative impor - tance of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in mediating different NRs - signaling pathways . Using the ChIP assay , we also showed that CCDC62 / ERAP75 could be recruited to the AP - 1 site within the promoter of the estrogen - responsive gene cyclin D1 to form a component of ER b transactiva - tion complexes . By real - time PCR , we also found that E2 regulated the ER target genes differentially in LNCaP cells and could induce the expression of cyclin D1 and TERT , but not the expression of pS2 and cathepsin D ( Figure 5F ) . Cyclin D1 and TERT have been shown to promote cell proliferation . The ability of estrogen to modulate those genes expression may directly contribute to the estrogen mitogenic effect on LNCaP cells . We have determined whether overexpression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 allows increased estrogen - dependent prolifera - tion . Our studies showed that inducible overexpression of CCDC62 / ERAP75 will stimulate E2 - mediated cyclin D1 expression and E2 - mediated LNCaP cell growth ( Figure 6B and C ) . Previous studies by Castagnetta et . al . ( 39 ) have shown that E2 - stimulated LNCaP cell growth is mediated by its own receptor . Ampliﬁcation of coactivators during PCa development may confer a selective growth advantage to ER - positive PCa cells . CCDC62 / ERAP75 can potentiate the estrogen - mediated mitogenic effect on the LNCaP cells , which might suggest that CCDC62 / ERAP75 is a potential regulator of cell proliferation by enhancing the ER transactivation and driving the cell cycle - related ER target gene expression . An early study suggested that E2 might activate the mutant AR transactivation in LNCaP cells to activate the gene expression ( 40 ) . The estrogen - dependent effects of CCDC62 / ERAP75 on cyclin D1 upregulation could be mediated through AR . However , we found that the E2 induction of cyclin D1 and telomerase ( TERT ) did not change via knockdown of the AR expression in the LNCaP cells ( see supple - mentary data and Figure S - 2 available at Carcinogenesis Online ) ; therefore , the E2 upregulation of cyclin D1 and TERT in LNCaP is mediated via ER b , not AR . Importantly , we showed that by modulat - ing endogenous CCDC62 / ERAP75 protein expression via siRNA techniques , the downregulation of CCDC62 / ERAP75 inhibited the ER b - mediated transactivation and reduced the E2 induction of ER target genes ( Figure 5F ) , which suggested an involvement of CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the ER b transcriptional activation . In the past 10 years , at least 40 different ER coactivators have been identiﬁed ( 2 ) . The reasons for the existence of a variety of coactivators are unclear . It is possible that ERs might use a different subset of coactivators for maximal transcriptional activity in a cell - type and promoter - dependent manner and that such a subset of coactivators is preferentially expressed in the cells and complexed with other transcription factors for maximal cross - talk of transcriptional regula - tion . In the present study , we found that CCDC62 / ERAP75 is prefer - entially expressed in PCa cells , enhances the ER b transactivation , target genes expression and E2 - mediated LNCaP cell growth . These ﬁndings raise the possibility for the role of CCDC62 / ERAP75 as an ER b coactivator to enhance its transactivation and receptor functions in PCa cells . Further studies may help us to better understand the roles of ER b and CCDC62 / ERAP75 in the PCa .
