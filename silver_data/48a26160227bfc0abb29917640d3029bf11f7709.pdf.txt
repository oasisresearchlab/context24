In addition to particle size , exosome transport and uptake by target cells is inﬂuenced by physical and physiological factors , including interstitial ﬂuid pressure , and exosome concentration . These variables differ under both normal and pathological conditions , including cancer . The transport of exosomes in TME is governed by interstitial ﬂow and diffusion . Based on these determinants , mathematical models were adapted to simulate the transport of exosomes in the TME with speciﬁed exosome release rates from the tumor cells . In this study , the signiﬁcance of spatial relationship in exosome - mediated intercellular communication was established by treating their movement in the TME as a continuum using a transport equation , with advection due to interstitial ﬂow and diffusion due to concentration gradients . To quantify the rate of release of exosomes by biomechanical forces acting on the tumor cells , we used a transwell platform with conﬂuent triple negative breast cancer cells 4T1 . 2 seeded in BioFlex plates exposed to an oscillatory force . Exosome release rates were quantiﬁed from 4T1 . 2 cells seeded at the bottom of the well following the application of either no force or an oscillatory force , and these rates were used to model exosome transport in the transwell . The simulations predicted that a larger number of exosomes reached the membrane of the transwell for 4T1 . 2 cells exposed to the oscillatory force when compared to controls . Additionally , we simulated the interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow and exosome transport in a 2 - dimensional TME with macrophages , T cells , and mixtures of these two populations at two different stages of a tumor growth . Computational simulations were carried out using the commercial computational simulation package , ANSYS / Fluent . The results of this study indicated higher exosome concentrations and larger interstitial ﬂuid pressure at the later stages of the tumor growth . Quantifying the release of exosomes by cancer cells , their transport through the TME , and their concentration in TME will afford a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of these interactions and aid in deriving predictive models for therapeutic intervention .

Modeling Exosome Transport in Tumor Microenvironment INTRODUCTION The tumor microenvironment ( TME ) , which contains multiple cell types , blood and lymph vessels , and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , is often immunosuppressive , blocking anti - tumor immunity , and mediating drug resistance ( 1 ) . Previous studies have shown that tumors have signiﬁcantly increased hydrostatic pressure and solid force ( tension , compression , and shear ) , and these forces activate signaling pathways and drive changes in tumor cell proliferation , adhesion , migration , and survival ( 2 ) . Emerging evidence indicates that biomechanical forces in the TME may inﬂuence tumor progression due to anti - tumor immune response through cancer cell - immune cell crosstalk , including that mediated by vesicular transport ( 3 , 4 ) . As a key mediator of cell - cell signaling within the TME , tumor cell exosomes have emerged as important regulators of several aspects of tumor progression ( 5 ) , including tumor initiation , progression and invasion , and preparation of pre - metastatic niches ( 6 , 7 ) . Exosomes are 50 – 150 nm membrane - bound extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) released by various cells in the TME , including tumor cells ( 8 ) . Exosomes contain proteins and microRNAs that can impact immune cell function . We and others have demonstrated that tumor - derived exosomes promote macrophages polarization ( 9 – 11 ) . They contribute to immune regulation and can create an immuno - privileged environment within tumors ( 8 , 12 ) . Exosomes secreted by the primary tumor lesion have been shown to aid in the formation of metastatic lesion in distant tissues ( i . e . , pre - metastatic niche formation ) before the cancer cells themselves migrate to the particular tissue . In 2012 , Peinado et al . ( 13 ) showed that when exosomes derived from melanoma cells , with highly metastatic potential to the lungs , were administered to mice , they promoted vascular permeability through the introduction of bone marrow cells to the lungs and thereby contributed to the formation of a pre - metastatic niche . Similarly , pancreatic cancer cell - derived exosomes formed a pre - metastatic niche for liver metastasis ( 6 , 14 ) . Internalization of pancreatic cancer cell - derived exosomes containing macrophage migration inhibitory factor by hepatic Kuppfer cells , induced ﬁbronectin and TGF - β production by hepatic stellate cells and ultimately formed a pre - metastatic niche through introduction of bone marrow cells to the liver ( 15 ) . In the context of infections , exosome transfer by lymphatic ﬂow from the periphery to the lymph node has been proposed to be a mechanism for rapid exchange of infection - speciﬁc information that precedes the arrival of migrating cells , thus priming the node for a more eﬀective immune response ( 16 ) . Recent studies have also investigated the utility of exosomes for drug delivery and as carriers of bioactive molecules ( 17 , 18 ) . In vivo studies demonstrate that after being internalized at the administration site and transferred to the systemic circulation , exosomes pass blood – tissue barriers and arrive in each tissue ( 17 – 19 ) .

Intravenously administered exosomes have been shown to be mainly distributed in the organs with a mononuclear phagocyte system such as the liver , spleen , lungs , and kidneys ( 6 , 13 , 20 ) . In our own studies , intratumoral injection of tumor - derived exosomes resulted in internalization by mononuclear phagocytes including immune suppressive myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( 21 ) . The release of exosomes by cancer cells , their transport through the TME , and their crosstalk with immune cells once they reach the tissue are not well - understood . Even though the importance of exosomes in TME is well - documented in literature , tools to quantify exosomes in TME are lacking . This necessitates the development of a numerical approach to simulate the transport of exosomes and estimate concentration gradients of exosomes in TME . With the advent of faster and better computational resources and algorithms , researchers have modeled various aspects of the TME including simulation of tumor growth in the microenvironment ( 22 – 25 ) . Several studies have comprehensively reviewed the existing models for tumor growth , tumor progression and morphology ( 22 , 23 ) . These models took into account the genetic characteristics of the tumor and the TME . Bresch et al . ( 24 ) used partial diﬀerential equations to model tumor growth and to estimate tumor densities , and level set methods to model the membrane . Sciumè et al . ( 25 ) developed an approach to model the TME with tumor and healthy cells , interstitial ﬂuid , and extracellular matrix using continuum mechanics principles . Crespo et al . documented the importance of mathematical modeling of heterogeneous systems in tumor microenvironments and interplay of these elements in TME ( 26 ) . Further , they elucidated the use of computational simulations in personalized cancer therapy and precision medicine . Various studies have addressed the computational simulation of interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow and estimation of shear stress and ﬂuid pressure ( 27 – 30 ) . Mitchell and King ( 27 ) recognized that mechanical forces such as ﬂuid shear stress can inﬂuence cancer metastasis . They used the Stokes equation , Darcy’s law , and Brinkman equation to estimate the ﬂuid properties in TME . Welter and Rieger ( 29 ) postulated that the elevated interstitial ﬂuid pressure due to a tumor could inﬂuence the interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow and delivery of drugs and nutrients to the cells . They modeled TME as a porous medium and the movement of chemicals in TME was modeled using a transport equation . A non - invasive technique to estimate the response of cancer treatment using imaging , pharmacokinetics , and interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow modeling was presented by Swinburne et al . ( 30 ) . In this modeling , the governing equations were taken as the Navier - Stokes equation and the extracellular matrix was modeled as a porous medium . Voronov et al . ( 31 ) used a numerical approach to estimate the ﬂuid shear stress in a scaﬀold . A high resolution micro - CT was used to extract the detailed geometry of the scaﬀold and the lattice Boltzmann method used for the modeling of ﬂuid ﬂow inside the scaﬀold . Kim et al . used a medical imaging technique ( 32 ) to extract high ﬁdelity 3 - D geometry of a tumor and mathematical models to delineate blood ﬂow and molecular transport . The goal of this multi - scale modeling was to develop a predictive model for tumor angiogenesis .

Modeling Exosome Transport in Tumor Microenvironment approach to model TME are cell or agent - based methods , which simulate the dynamic evolution of individual entities called agents based on a set of rules ( 33 – 36 ) . A survey of diﬀerent cell - based mathematical models to analyze TME and their relative strengths and weaknesses are presented in Rejniak and McCawley ( 37 ) . Cell - based approaches are particularly useful in modeling individual cell behavior such as polarization of immune cells , which provide insight into the dynamic processes in heterogeneous TME . Although various aspects of TME have been modeled using computational simulations , the computational tools to simulate exosome transport in TME are lacking . Quantifying exosome concentration and factors that regulate their interactions with various cells in the TME will aﬀord a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of interaction and aid in deriving predictive models for therapeutic intervention . This article focuses on a computational technique to model the transport of exosomes in the TME by taking into account exosome production by cancer cells , exosome advection due to interstitial ﬂow , and exosome diﬀusion due to concentration gradients . MATERIALS AND METHODS Computational Modeling In this study , because of the sub - micron size of exosomes , their movement in the TME was treated as a continuum and modeled using an advection - diﬀusion transport equation , with advection due to interstitial ﬂow and diﬀusion due to concentration gradients ( 38 ) . In general , an exosome transport equation can be written as , ∂ c k ∂ t + ∂ u i c k ∂ x i = ∂ ∂ x i (cid:18) Ŵ k ∂ c k ∂ x i (cid:19) + S c k , k = 1 , . . . , N ( 1 ) Where c k is the concentration of the k th type of exosome in a heterogeneous ﬁeld with N number of exosome types , u i is the interstitial ﬂuid velocity components , Γ k is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient , and S ck is the exosome source or sink term . In the above equation , the second term on the left - hand side models the movement of exosomes due to interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow , the ﬁrst term on the right - hand side models the diﬀusion of exosomes due to concentration gradients , and the last term on the right - hand side represents the production of exosomes by donor cells ( tumor cells ) and uptake of exosomes by receptor cells ( immune cells ) . In this study , the uptake of exosomes by immune cells were not taken into consideration . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the simulation was taken from the data published in the literature ( 38 – 42 ) . The interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow in TME is governed by the Navier - Stokes equations ( 43 – 45 ) , which is the mathematical representation of the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy . The ﬂuid ﬂow in TME is incompressible in nature , and heat transfer is also not an important factor for the ﬂow in TME ( 46 ) . Therefore , the energy equation was not considered for the following simulations . The turbulent eﬀects were not modeled due to the fact that the Reynolds number for the interstitial ﬂow was very small . Therefore , the laminar ﬂow assumption was used for the simulations . Computational simulations presented in this article were carried out using the commercial computational simulation package called ANSYS / Fluent ( 47 ) . It has capabilities to model Navier - Stokes and transport equations for diﬀerent ﬂow regimes using various numerical schemes , and is commonly used in academia and industries . In the present simulations , the transport of exosome in TME was carried out in two stages using a staggered approach . In the ﬁrst stage the Navier - Stokes equations were solved to estimate the velocity ﬁeld . In the second stage , the transport equations were solved using the velocity ﬁeld predicted from the ﬁrst step . In these simulations , it was assumed that the transport of exosomes in TME would not aﬀect the underlying velocity ﬁeld . Geometries for TME , presented in this article were extracted from the images created using Biorender ( 48 ) . These images were segmented using edge detection techniques to get the outer boundaries of tumor and immune cells present in TME , with the application of the geometry modeling program SpaceClaim available in Ansys ( 47 ) . Validation of the Numerical Approach Validation of the numerical methods using experimental data or analytical solution of an appropriate problem is an important step in computational simulations . The numerical approach to solve the advection - diﬀusion equation used in this study was validated using a Gaussian source in a planar shear ﬂow ( 49 , 50 ) . The computational domain for this simulation was taken as a square with dimension 100 × 100 mm , with the origin at the geometric center . In this test case , the y - component of the velocity was taken as zero and the x - component of the velocity was assumed to vary linearly as U + λ y , where U and λ are constants . At time equals zero , the concentration of the transport variable was taken as an impulse function at the origin , multiplied by a constant M . The exact solution of the concentration for this Gaussian source in a planar shear ﬂow at any spatial location and at any time is given by the relation ( 49 , 50 ) , c (cid:0) x , y , t (cid:1) = M 4 π Dt (cid:16) 1 + ( λ t ) 2 12 (cid:17) 1 2 exp   − 1 4 Dt   y 2 + ( x − (cid:0) U − 0 . 5 λ y (cid:1) t ) 2 (cid:16) 1 + ( λ t ) 2 12 (cid:17)     ( 2 ) Where c is the concentration and D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient . More details on the analytical solution of this benchmark test case can be found in references ( 42 , 43 ) . Numerical values of diﬀerent parameters used in this benchmark test case are listed in Table 1 . To keep the concentration as ﬁnite values in the computational domain at the beginning of the simulation , the exact solution at time equals 1 min was used .

Modeling Exosome Transport in Tumor Microenvironment Cell Culture and Exposure to Strain The rate of release of exosomes is inﬂuenced by biomechanical forces acting on the tumor cells , and to quantify this , an experimental setup depicted in Figure 1 was used . The murine TNBC cell line 4T1 . 2 ( an aggressive clone derived from 4T1 ) was obtained from Dr . Robin L . Anderson’s laboratory ( Peter McCallum Cancer Center , Australia ) . 4T1 . 2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and 10 mM HEPES ( MP Biomedicals , Santa Ana , CA ) . Prior to the exposure to tensile strain , the 4T1 . 2 cells were stained with the lypophilic dye PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , per the manufacturer’s instructions . 2 . 5 × 10 5 4T1 . 2 were seeded on collagen coated 6 well UniFlex culture plates ( Flexcell International Corporation , Burlington , NC ) and cultured to conﬂuence . Once conﬂuent , the media was changed to exosome depleted growth media and the plates were subjected to 10 % uniaxial oscillatory strain at 0 . 3 Hz for 48 h , 10 % constant strain for 48 h , or no strain for 48 h using a FlexCell FX - 6000 or FX - 5000 Tension System . Preparation of Exosome - Depleted Media The exosome - depleted medium was prepared as previously described ( 51 ) . Brieﬂy , DMEM media supplemented with 20 % FBS was centrifuged using an ultracentrifuge overnight at 100 , 000 × g at 4 ◦ C . The supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0 . 2 µ m cellulose acetate ﬁlter ( Corning , NY ) . The exosome depleted media was then diluted 1 : 1 with DMEM to make a ﬁnal concentration of 10 % FBS and 10 mM HEPES . Isolation of Exosomes From Conditioned Media and Quantiﬁcation of Concentration Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) were isolated as previously described ( 21 ) . Brieﬂy , conditioned media was collected following 48 h exposure to NF or OF and centrifuge at 2 , 000 × g to remove any cell fragments or apoptotic bodies . The supernatant was then incubated with the Total Exosome Isolation Reagent for Cell Culture Media kit ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) per the manufacturer’s protocol . Puriﬁed exosomes were stored in 50 µ l of PBS at − 80 ◦ C . Exosome concentration was quantiﬁed using Imagestream ﬂow cytometry . Immune Cell Exosome Internalization 0 . 4 µ m pore size transwell ﬁlters ( MilliporeSigma , Burlington , MA ) were added on top of strained or control 6 well plates containing PKH26 + 4T1 . 2 cells . Subsequently , 5 × 10 4 puriﬁed naïve lung macrophages ( CD11b + CD64 + ) , or 3 × 10 5 puriﬁed splenic T cells ( CD45 + CD8 + ) , or a mixture of these cell populations ( 1 : 3 ratio of macrophages to T cells , total of 2 × 10 5 ) were added into the top well of the transwell ﬁlter . After 24 h , cells on the upper surface of the transwell ﬁlter FIGURE 1 | Schematic of experimental protocol . ( A ) 4T1 . 2 cells were seeded in BioFlex plates ( 1 ) , once cells reached conﬂuence they were exposed to OF strain ( or NF ) ( 2 ) . Strain exposed ( or NF ) cells were either put into co - cultured with immune cells ( T cells and macrophages ) using transwell ( 3 ) or conditioned media was collected for exosome isolation .

Modeling Exosome Transport in Tumor Microenvironment were removed and tumor cell exosome internalization was evaluated using ImageStream ﬂow cytometry , evaluating cell speciﬁc markers CD8 and CD11b , along with PKH26 , to indicate exosome internalization . RESULTS Results From the Validation of the Numerical Approach For the simulation of the validation test case , the concentration of the transport variable at the beginning of the simulation is shown in Figure 2A , and the concentration after 45 min is shown in Figure 2B . These data show the advection due to the shear ﬂow and diﬀusion due to the concentration gradient . Also , it can be seen from the result that as time progresses , the concentration gets distorted due to the velocity gradient normal to the ﬂow direction . Computations were carried out to calculate the concentrations at 45 min using diﬀerent numerical schemes and a quantitative comparison of the computed results with the analytical data is presented in Figure 3 . 3 - D Transwell Modeling To mimic the experimental setup depicted in Figure 1 , a 3 - D computational model of the transwell geometry was created , as shown in Figure 4A , and was used for the simulation of exosome transport . This geometry was created using the computer aided geometry ( CAD ) modeler available in ANSYS ( 47 ) . The cells that release exosomes were placed at the bottom chamber and the release rates of the exosomes from these cells were taken from the experiments described in the previous section . The experimental measurements described in section Isolation of Exosomes from Conditioned Media and Quantiﬁcation of Concentration showed that the average exosome release rates were 515 . 3 , and 986 . 3 per hour per 10 5 cells , for NF and OF groups , respectively ( Figure 1B ) . In co - culture experiments , internalization of exosomes by immune cells could reduce the exosome concentration near these cells , which could potentially aﬀect the diﬀusion . However , experimental evidence showed that the concentration change due to internalization was small ( Figure 1C ) and therefore , exosome internalization measurements from the experiment were assumed negligible and was not modeled . The presented numerical approach will be further reﬁned by adding a sink term in the transport equation ( equation 1 ) to represent exosome internalization in future studies . For the computational simulations , 3 . 6 × 10 6 cells were assumed to be placed at the bottom of the transwell for both NF and OF groups , and the exosome source ﬂuxes from the bottom surface were estimated using the exosome release rates from the experiments and the area of the bottom surface of the transwell . For these simulations , the ﬂuid medium in the transwell arrangement was taken as stagnant . This resulted in the transport of exosomes in the transwell based completely on diﬀusion . Therefore , the velocity ﬁeld was set as zero and the Navier - Stokes equations were not used to calculate the ﬂow ﬁeld . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient for this simulation was taken as 2 . 0 × 10 − 3 m 2 / s . The unsteady transport equation was used to estimate the exosome concentration in the computational domain . The initial concentration of the exosomes in the transwell was taken as zero and the computational simulation calculated the time evolution of exosome concentration in the transwell . Simulations were carried out for 72 h and the concentration of exosomes in the computational domain for NF and the comparison of the number of exosomes that reached the membrane for both NF and OF groups are shown in Figures 4B , C .

Modeling the Tumor Microenvironment The presence of tumor in a microenvironment not only inﬂuences the dynamic behavior of the cells in the microenvironment , but also changes the interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow properties such as pressure and shear stress distributions , and ﬂow patterns . As the tumor grows , obstruction to ﬂow increases and the exosome release rate also increases due to the larger number of cancer cells . To model TME , two diﬀerent conﬁgurations at two diﬀerent stages of the tumor growth in TMEs with macrophages , T cells , and MDSCs were created using Biorender ( 48 ) . This approach of generating geometries for TME using Biorender images was considered for this proof - of - principle study . However , more realistic TME from medical images will be considered in follow - up studies . The TME with diﬀerent cell types at the later stage of growth is shown in Figure 5A . The distribution and proportions of these cell populations were based on what is observed normally in the TME in murine models of both lung and breast cancer ( 21 , 52 – 55 ) . The extracted geometry using image segmentation techniques and a zoomed - in view of the computational mesh near the tumor surface are shown in Figures 5B , C , respectively . In this simulation , the interstitial ﬂuid was assumed to be coming from the left side of the computational domain with a velocity of 0 . 75 µ m / s . The Navier - Stokes equations together with laminar ﬂow assumptions were used for the calculation of the velocity ﬁeld in TME . This computed velocity ﬁeld was used for the evaluation of the advective component of the transport equation . The exosome release rates for the initial and ﬁnal stages of the tumor were taken as 2 . 5 and 7 . 5 exosomes per second , respectively . The computed streamlines in TME and the concentration of exosomes after 45 min are shown in Figure 6 .

Modeling Exosome Transport in Tumor Microenvironment FIGURE 4 | Computational domain and the results from modeling of exosome transport in a transwell . For this modeling , exosome release rate for the cells placed at the bottom surface is taken as 515 . 3 and 986 . 3 / h . / 10 5 cells for NF and OF , respectively . ( A ) A cross - sectional view of the 3 - dimensional computational domain used for the simulation . ( B ) Exosome gradient on a plane through the middle of the transwell for NF after 72h . ( C ) A comparison of the number of exosomes at the membrane for NF and OF groups as a function of time . DISCUSSION The validation of the numerical approach for the computational modeling was carried out using the advection and diﬀusion of a material in a planar shear ﬂow , which has an analytical solution . The order of the discretization of the spatial derivative terms in the transport equation ( equation 1 ) inﬂuences the accuracy of computational simulations . To estimate the accuracy of these discretizations and to select an appropriate numerical scheme for the rest of the simulations presented in this paper , simulations were conducted using ﬁrst order , second order upwind , second order QUICK , and third order MUSCL schemes ( 43 – 45 ) . The computed concentrations at 45 min from these simulations were compared with the exact solution ( equation 2 ) in Figure 3 . This comparison shows that the results from the second and third order schemes are in very good agreement with the analytical results , and the selected schemes are able to model both advection and diﬀusion accurately . Therefore , for the rest of the calculations , a second order numerical scheme was used . The transwell simulations modeled the exosome transport through a stagnant region due to the concentration gradient . As expected , exosome gradient on a plane showed a higher concentration of exosomes at the bottom wall and a lower concentration at the top of both bottom and top wells . In this ﬁgure , red represents a higher concentration of exosomes and blue represents a lower concentration . Figure 4C compares the number of exosomes that have reached the membrane at the base of the top well for both NF and OF groups . Computational simulations showed that at all times , a larger number of exosomes reached the membrane for the OF group compared to the NF group . After 72 h , ∼ 2 . 86 × 10 4 exosomes reached the membrane for 4T1 . 2 cells exposed to OF compared 1 . 58 × 10 4 exosomes for those exposed to NF . The diﬀerence in the number of exosomes passing through the membrane is due to the higher release rate for the OF group , resulting in a higher concentration gradient and faster diﬀusion . The rate of release of exosomes by the tumor cells in the OF group is ∼ 1 . 9 times compared to the release rate for the ones in the NF group . This shows the number of exosomes that reached the membrane is close to being linearly proportional to the exosome release rate . As shown in Figure 6 , the release rate for the later stage of the tumor was taken as a larger value due to the presence of a larger number of cells in the tumor . Here , red represents higher and blue represents lower exosome concentrations . In the later stage ( B ) , the predicted average concentration of the exosomes was ∼ 3 . 5 times greater than the predicted exosome concentration in the early stage ( A ) . The streamline patterns in the TME for the two diﬀerent stages of the tumor growth is also plotted in Figure 6 . It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the ﬂow pattern in the TME is more complex for the later stage of the tumor Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 7 April 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 643793 Koomullil et al .

In addition to the complex ﬂow pattern , the interstitial ﬂuid pressure was higher for the later stages of the tumor growth compared to the early stage , see Figure 7 . This could also lead to a higher rate of exosome release due to the larger mechanical forces acting on the tumor surface .

The predicted pressure distribution is greater for the later stage of the tumor growth , due to greater obstruction for the ﬂow by a larger tumor . inﬂuence of higher interstitial ﬂuid pressure on exosome release was not taken into account . The concentration of exosomes in TME is an important parameter in cellular crosstalk and evolution of the dynamic environment . Drug delivery and microRNA delivery via exosomes for speciﬁc targets in the TME is an active area of investigation that has signiﬁcant translational potential . This paper presents a numerical approach to model the transport of exosomes in the TME and quantify exosome concentrations . Results are presented to validate the approach using a benchmark test case , and the accuracy of diﬀerent numerical schemes are presented by comparing numerical results with the exact solution . The numerical approach presented in our studies is a valuable tool to quantify exosome concentration , exosome gradient , and time evolution of exosome concentration in a TME . This approach can be combined with agent - based models to simulate exosome uptake by immune cells and their polarization . This will enable the evaluation of the inﬂuence of diﬀerent parameters , including the magnitude of force , the frequency and duration of the application , and distance from the tumor cells on the impact of exosomes on immune populations and their polarization rather quickly , without conducting a large number of experiments . This will also make it easier , faster , and more cost - eﬀective to study the eﬀect of the wide range of these parameter values on immune cell polarization that determine the eﬀector or suppressor function at the TME . The use of this numerical approach for in - vivo applications requires the proper estimation of tissue properties in a heterogeneous environment , accurate representation of distribution of various cell types in the dynamic ECM environment , and the uptake and polarization of immune cells . However , this approach could serve as a tool to study the propagation of exosomes secreted by the primary tumor lesion and pre - metastatic niche formation in distant tissues , before the cancer cells themselves migrate to the particular tissue , and this will be explored in future studies . Additionally , modeling the dynamics of exosome transport in in - vitro models will provide insights to enhance the understanding of exosome transport in vivo from the primary tumor site to metastatic sites of the tumor and how exosome transport may inﬂuence metastatic niche .
