Genes to Cells © 2018 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia , Ltd 1 | INTRODUCTION The glomeruli in the kidney play central roles in blood filtra - tion and homeostatic regulation of the urinary system through a well - organized filtration unit composed of fenestrated en - dothelial cells , the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) and visceral epithelial cells called podocytes ( Haraldsson , Nystrom , & Deen , 2008 ) . Podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells that extend numerous actin - rich projections know as foot pro - cesses , which interdigitate and cover the capillary walls of the glomerulus ( Pavenstadt , Kriz , & Kretzler , 2003 ; Scott & Quaggin , 2015 ) . At the site of interdigitation , a specialized intercellular junction , the slit diaphragm , is formed and func - tions as the final sieve of the glomerular filter . Alterations in the genes encoding proteins expressed in podocytes , such as nephrin , podocin and α - actinin - 4 , have been identified as responsible for human congenital nephrotic syndrome ( Boute et al . , 2000 ; Kaplan et al . , 2000 ; Kestila et al . , 1998 ) , and mice deficient for these molecules exhibit renal diseases ( Kos et al . , 2003 ; Putaala , Soininen , Kilpelainen , Wartiovaara , & Tryggvason , 2001 ; Roselli et al . , 2004 ) , indicating that podo - cytes and their components play essential roles in controlling glomerular functions .

During podocyte differentiation , tight junctions are replaced by slit diaphragms , which are formed between foot processes and function as a blood filtration barrier . Although the expression of most tight junction components is sup - pressed during podocyte differentiation , several components , including ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 , are consistently expressed . We recently showed that podocyte - specific dele - tion of ZO - 1 gene impaired slit diaphragm formation , leading to proteinuria and glo - merular sclerosis . Here , we address the relevance of ZO - 2 , whose sequence is highly similar to ZO - 1 , in the maintenance of the structure and function of podocytes . In glomerular development , the spatiotemporal expression of ZO - 2 was similar to that of ZO - 1 until the capillary loop stage . Subsequently , the distribution patterns of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 diverged at the maturation stage , when slit diaphragms are formed . This divergence could partly rely on the ability of ZO - 2 to interact with the slit diaphragm membrane proteins . Podocyte - specific deletion of the ZO - 2 gene did not cause overt defects ; however , double knockout of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 genes accelerated the defects observed in ZO - 1 knockout mice . These results suggest that ZO - 2 plays supportive roles in the ZO - 1 - dependent regulation of podocyte filtration barrier .

During the following S - shaped body stage , apically located tight junctions relocate toward the basal region , and podocyte - specific molecules , such as nephrin and NEPH family mem - bers ( NEPH1 and NEPH3 ) are expressed . Subsequently , podocytes begin to form broad foot processes during the cap - illary loop stage , leading to the formation of slit diaphragms between interdigitating foot processes at the maturation stage ( Grahammer , Schell , & Huber , 2013 ; Scott & Quaggin , 2015 ) . It has been suggested that tight junctions in podocytes disappear in the late capillary loop stage ( Scott & Quaggin , 2015 ) . In accordance with such structural alterations , the expression of most tight junction components is down - regulated or lost , but several molecules , including ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 , are persistently expressed in differentiated podocytes . ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 are structurally highly homologous and play crucial roles in the regulation of the structure and function of tight junctions ( Itoh & Bissell , 2003 ; Tsukita , Furuse , & Itoh , 2001 ) . Previous studies have shown that tight junctions and the epithelial barrier are severely compromised when both ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 are depleted in mammary epithelial cells , and the re - expression of either ZO - 1 or ZO - 2 was suf - ficient to rescue the defects , indicating that ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 have redundant functions in the regulation of the epithelial tight junctions ( Itoh , Tsukita , Yamazaki , & Sugimoto , 2012 ; Umeda et al . , 2006 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , mice deficient in either ZO - 1 or ZO - 2 exhibit early embryonic lethality at different stages of embryonic development , sug - gesting that ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 have distinct roles in the mouse ontogeny ( Katsuno et al . , 2008 ; Xu et al . , 2008 ) . We recently showed that the podocyte - specific deletion of ZO - 1 in mice impaired the architecture of interdigitated foot processes and formation of slit diaphragm structures ( Itoh et al . , 2014 ) . Podocyte - specific ZO - 1 knockout mice exhibited extensive nonselective proteinuria and disturbance of renal function with the reduction in glomerular filtration ability , leading to growth retardation . These observations suggest that ZO - 1 performs an essential role in the formation and maintenance of the podocyte filtration barrier , and that ZO - 2 does not play a redundant role that can compensate for the absence of ZO - 1 in podocytes . In this study , we addressed the distinctive characteristics of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 with respect to podocytes and glomeruli in vivo and in vitro . We found that the spatiotemporal ex - pression of ZO - 2 was quite similar to that of ZO - 1 until the capillary loop stage . Then , the distribution patterns of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 diverged during the maturation stage when the slit diaphragms are formed . In vitro analyses showed that ZO - 1 strongly associated with the slit diaphragm membrane pro - teins , NEPH1 and NEPH3 . In contrast , ZO - 2 exhibited this interaction only with NEPH1 . In addition , localization of NEPH1 was affected by ZO - 1 , but not by ZO - 2 . Thus , the differences in the roles of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in maintenance of podocytes are partly due to their differential ability to in - teract with slit diaphragm membrane proteins . We generated and analyzed podocyte - specific ZO - 2 knockout mice , as well as ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 double - knockout mice to investigate the structural and functional relevance of ZO - 2 alone and ZO - 2 in combination with ZO - 1 with respect to the blood filtra - tion barrier . We showed that podocytes deficient for ZO - 2 do not exhibit obvious defects , with foot processes and slit diaphragms showing a comparable architecture with those in control mice and the absence of severe proteinuria . Growth and life span were also comparable between control and podocyte - specific ZO - 2 knockout mice . In contrast , ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 double - knockout mice presented with a more severe phenotypes than that of mice lacking only ZO - 1 , suggesting that ZO - 2 might play a supportive role in maintenance of ZO - 1 - dependent glomerular regulation . These findings enable us to improve our understanding of how the glomerular filtration barrier is regulated by ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 and the roles of these proteins in the slit diaphragm with respect to tight junctions . 2 | RESULTS 2 . 1 | Expression and localization of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in the developing glomerular podocytes The development of the renal glomerulus is divided into sev - eral stages . It has been shown that podocyte - specific mol - ecules such as nephrin start to express at the late S - shaped body stage or the early capillary loop stage , at a time when most tight junction molecules are suppressed and tight junc - tions disappear to give way to the formation of slit dia - phragms ( Scott & Quaggin , 2015 ) . Previous studies showed that both ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 are expressed in mature podocytes ( Bautista - García et al . , 2012 ; Itoh et al . , 2014 ) ; however , the spatiotemporal expression of these molecules , especially ZO - 2 , in developing podocytes was not known . To elucidate this expression , frozen sections of newborn mouse kidney , in which the early developmental stages of the glomerulus can be observed , were stained with antibodies against ZO - 1 or ZO - 2 , together with an antineph - rin antibody , which marks developing podocytes . At the early capillary loop stage , ZO - 1 was detected in nephrin - positive podocytes ( Figure 1a , dotted square ) , as well as at tight junctions in renal tubule epithelial cells ( Figure 1a , arrows ) and in blood vessels ( Figure 1a , arrow - heads ) with almost comparable signal intensity . ZO - 2 exhib - ited similar expression and localization patterns to those of ZO - 1 ( Figure 1b and Supporting Information Figure S1A ) ; ZO - 2 was clearly detected in podocytes at the early capillary loop stage ( Figure 1b , dotted square ) and in renal tubule ep - ithelial cells ( Figure 1b , arrows ) , while the signal in blood 548 | Genes to Cells ITOH eT al . vessels was weak compared to that of ZO - 1 ( Figure 1b , arrowheads ) . We also analyzed the expression of occludin , a tight junc - tion integral membrane protein , and found that its expression was undetectable in podocytes at the early capillary loop stage ( Figure 1c , dotted square ) , whereas in renal tubule ep - ithelial cells , occludin was readily detected ( Figure 1c , ar - rows ) . As other tight junction molecules , such as ZO - 3 , were absent from podocytes ( data not shown ) , only limited tight junction components appeared to be expressed in differenti - ating podocytes , even during the early developmental stage . As glomerular development proceeded from the cap - illary loop stage to the maturation stage , the difference in the ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 expression in podocytes became evi - dent ( Supporting Information Figure S1 ) . The ZO - 1 signal appeared broad and linear , indicating the concentration of ZO - 1 at the slit diaphragm . In contrast , ZO - 2 staining was weak and fragmented compared to that of ZO - 1 ( Supporting Information Figure S1B ) . These results indicated that the similar spatiotemporal ex - pression of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in podocytes during the capillary loop stage starts to diverge during the maturation stage when the slit diaphragm is formed . 2 . 2 | Interaction between slit diaphragm membrane proteins and ZO proteins Previous studies have reported that ZO - 1 interacts with slit diaphragm components , especially with integral membrane proteins , such as nephrin , NEPH1 and NEPH3 that con - tain a PDZ - binding motif at their C - terminus ( Huber et al . , 2003 ; Lehtonen , Lehtonen , Kudlicka , Holthöfer , & Farquhar , 2004 ) . We postulated that the absence of ZO - 2 from the slit diaphragm may be due to a lack of interaction with those membrane proteins . To address this possibility , we examined the association between these molecules by immunoprecipi - tation assays . Flag - tagged nephrin ( Flag - nephrin ) , NEPH1 ( Flag - NEPH1 ) , NEPH3 ( Flag - NEPH3 ) or their mutants lacking the C - terminus containing the PDZ - biding motif ( Flag - nephrinΔCT , Flag - NEPH1ΔCT , Flag - NEPH3ΔCT ) were transfected in cells together with HA - tagged ZO - 1 ( HA - ZO - 1 ) or ZO - 2 ( HA - ZO - 2 ) , and the cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation assays using anti - Flag antibody followed by western blot analysis using anti - Flag and anti - HA antibodies ( Figure 2a ) . We found an interaction between ZO - 1 and nephrin , NEPH1 and NEPH3 , although the association with nephrin was significantly weaker as compared to that with NEPH1 or NEPH3 . As expected , the deletion of the C - terminal PDZ - binding domain of NEPH1 or NEPH3 abolished interactions with ZO - 1 . Similar to ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 also exhibited only a weak association with nephrin , whereas it was efficiently copre - cipitated with wild - type NEPH1 , but not with NEPH1ΔCT . However , unlike ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 did not show a significant asso - ciation with NEPH3 . We further examined the association between these molecules in cells by immunofluorescence colocalization FIGURE 1 Spatiotemporal expression of ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 and occludin in the developing glomerulus .

First , cells were independently transfected with ei - ther HA - ZO - 1 , HA - ZO - 2 , Flag - nephrin , Flag - NEPH1 or Flag - NEPH3 . ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 were highly concentrated at cell – cell adhesion sites ( Figure 2b ) . Nephrin and NEPH3 exhibited a mostly diffuse distribution , whereas NEPH1 showed a punctate distribution pattern ( Figure 2c ) . When cells were cotransfected with ZO - 1 and nephrin , colocalization of these molecules was rarely observed and the distribution of each molecule was similar as when ex - pressed independently ( Figure 2d , i – iii ) . In contrast , cotrans - fection of ZO - 1 and NEPH1 altered the localization of both molecules . ZO - 1 exhibited a punctate distribution pattern in addition to being concentrated at cell – cell contact sites . The distribution of NEPH1 extensively overlapped with that of ZO - 1 at both sites , suggesting that these molecules interacted and recruited each other to distinct subcellular sites in cells FIGURE 2 Interaction between ZO molecules and slit diaphragm integral membrane proteins .

( Figure 2d , iv – vi ) . NEPH3 also exhibited colocalization with ZO - 1 , mostly at cell – cell contact sites , indicating recruitment of NEPH3 by ZO - 1 ( Figure 2d , vii – ix ) . Furthermore , these colocalizations were abolished on deleting the C - terminal do - mains of NEPH1 or NEPH3 ( Supporting Information Figure S2A ) , indicating that the PDZ - binding motif of these mole - cules is required for their association and codistribution with ZO - 1 in cells . As for ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 and nephrin did not show significant co - localization when coexpressed . Their subcellular localization was similar to that in cell expressing the two proteins individually . In contrast , the coexpression of NEPH1 significantly altered the distribution of ZO - 2 , which was recruited to the NEPH1 - positive punctate structures . Moreover , in the presence of NEPH1 , ZO - 2 was no longer concentrated at cell – cell contact sites , unlike ZO - 1 . Consistent with the results of immunoprecipitation as - says , NEPH1ΔCT did not colocalize with ZO - 2 ( Supporting Information Figure S2B ) , indicating that C - terminal PDZ - binding motif of NEPH1 was required for the redistribution of ZO - 2 in cells . Furthermore , NEPH3 and ZO - 2 exhibited distinctive local - ization patterns , indicating that ZO - 2 did not interact with NEPH3 in cells , which is another characteristic different from that of ZO - 1 . These data thus indicated that differences in binding ability to NEPH3 and / or subcellular redistribution by NEPH1 could repre - sent molecular mechanisms underlying the concentration of ZO - 1 , but not the homologous molecule , ZO - 2 , at the slit diaphragms . 2 . 3 | Generation of podocyte - specific ZO - 2 - deficient and ZO - 1 / ZO - 2 - deficient mice We generated podocyte - specific ZO - 2 knockout ( KO ) mice to elucidate whether ZO - 2 plays physiological roles in glo - merular blood filtration , by crossing Tjp2 flox / flox mice and nphs1 - cre transgenic mice ( Asano et al . , 2005 ; Xu et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , mice deficient in both ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 ( DKO ) in podocytes were established to address whether these molecules play distinctive or redundant roles in the structure and function of the glomerulus . Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the expression and deletion of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in the knockout mice as compared to controls ( Figure 3a ) . In ZO - 1 KO , Bowman’s capsule epithelial cells ( Figure 3a , iii , arrowheads ) , endo - thelial cells ( Figure 3a , iii , arrows ) and renal tubule epithe - lial cells ( Figure 3a , iii , double arrows ) exhibited positive staining for ZO - 1 , indicating podocyte - specific gene de - letion in the glomerulus . As we reported previously ( Itoh et al . , 2014 ) , ZO - 2 expression was not affected by podocyte - specific ZO - 1 KO , and we found that , conversely , the loss of ZO - 2 also did not alter the spatiotemporal expression of ZO - 1 . To evaluate the functional integrity of the podocyte filtration barrier , mouse urine was collected and analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( Figure 3b ) . Elevated protein levels were detected in the urine of podocyte - specific ZO - 1 KO mice . In contrast , only low levels of proteins were present in the urine of ZO - 2 KO mice . In contrast , DKO mice developed massive proteinuria that appeared more severe than that in ZO - 1 KO mice . In accordance with defects of the blood filtration barrier , podocyte - specific ZO - 1 KO mice exhib - ited significant growth retardation and a reduced life span , while ZO - 2 KO mice were indistinguishable from controls ( Figure 3c ) . The growth and life span of podocyte - specific DKO mice were severely impaired and worse than in ZO - 1 KO mice . Whereas ZO - 1 KO mice started to die around 4 weeks of age , DKO mice started to die at 3 weeks of age . ( Figure 3d ) . These results suggested that ZO - 2 expressed in podocytes did not play indispensable roles in the maintenance of the structure and function of blood filtering glomeruli , but rather might play supportive roles in the ZO - 1 - dependent regulation of podocyte filtration barrier . 2 . 4 | Structural abnormalities of glomerular podocytes are more severe in DKO mice than those of podocytes in ZO - 1 KO mice To further investigate the effects of the deletion of ZO - 1 and / or ZO - 2 in podocytes , histological analysis of glomeruli from 2 - week - old mice was carried out ( Figure 4 ) . Light mi - croscopic analysis of hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) stained sections indicated that ZO - 2 deficiency in podocytes did not appreciably affect the integrity of glomerular struc - tures ( Figure 4a , iii ) , whereas the glomeruli from podocyte - specific ZO - 1 KO mice exhibited disorganized architecture ( Figure 4a , ii ) . The irregular fibrillar structures ( Figure 4a , ii , arrows ) and enlarged Bowman’s space ( Figure 4a , ii , arrow - heads ) were observed in ZO - 1 KO mice . We found that the glomeruli from podocyte - specific DKO mice showed scle - rotic abnormalities characterized by the accumulation of ex - tracellular matrix ( Figure 4a , iv , arrows ) , which were a more severe impairment than that observed in podocyte - specific ZO - 1 KO mice at the same age . The ultrastructure of glomeruli in these mice was ana - lyzed by transmission electron microscopy ( Figure 4b ) . The podocytes deficient for ZO - 2 had apparently normal foot processes and formed slit diaphragms similar as controls ( Figure 4b , i – iii and vii – ix ) . In ZO - 1 - deficient podocytes , slit diaphragms between the foot processes were absent ( Figure 4b , iv – vi ) , as previously reported ( Itoh et al . , 2014 ) . In podocyte - specific DKO mice ( Figure 4b , x – xii ) , podo - cytes appeared to be severely disordered and foot processes were effaced ( Figure 4b , xii , arrowheads ) . An extracellu - lar matrix was excessively accumulated in the glomerulus ( Figure 4b , x , arrows ) and the GBM was significantly dis - organized ( Figure 4b , xii , arrows ) , which are pathological characteristics of glomerulosclerosis . These abnormalities | 551 Genes to Cells ITOH eT al . were similar to those observed in ZO - 1 KO mice at approx - imately 4 weeks or later , as described previously ( Itoh et al . , 2014 ) . To gain further insights into the organization of glomeruli and podocytes , we carried out scanning electron microscopic analysis ( Figure 5 ) . The foot processes of neighboring podo - cytes interdigitate with each other in the control ( Figure 5 , i – iii ) and podocyte - specific ZO - 2 KO mice ( Figure 5 , i – iii and vii – ix ) . In contrast , interdigitation and adhesion to the GBM of foot processes was disordered in podocyte - specific ZO - 1 KO mice ( Figure 5 , iv – vi ) . Similar , but more severe disorga - nization of foot processes was observed in podocyte - specific DKO mice ( Figure 5 , x – xii ) . These results suggested that ZO - 2 deficiency itself does not sig - nificantly damage podocytes nor disorganize glomerular structures , but ZO - 2 could partially contribute to the formation and / or main - tenance of glomeruli by supporting ZO - 1 functions in podocytes . 3 | DISCUSSION Here , we investigated roles of tight junction proteins ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 , which have high sequence similarity to one another , in glomerular architecture and functions using podocyte - specific KO mice , in conjunction with biochemical and cellular biological analyses .

We identified that developing podocytes expressed both ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 ; these proteins were expressed at levels al - most comparable to those in renal tubule epithelial cells at the capillary loop stage , whereas occludin was detected only in renal tubule epithelial cells . However , during the maturation stage when slit diaphragms are formed between foot processes FIGURE 4 Histological analyses of podocyte - specific ZO - 1 and / or ZO - 2 knockout mice .

This observation indicated that the subcellular localization of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in podocytes diverged at this stage , with ZO - 1 , rather than ZO - 2 , primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of slit diaphragms . Our previous ( Itoh et al . , 2014 ) and current studies using KO mice supported this hypothesis . We showed that the de - letion of ZO - 1 in podocytes led to the disruption of slit di - aphragm structures and foot process architecture , resulting in proteinuria followed by glomerular sclerosis . In contrast , ZO - 2 inactivation did not provide obvious alterations to glo - merular podocytes . However , when both ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 were deleted , the degeneration of podocytes was accelerated compared to deleting ZO - 1 alone . These results indicated that ZO - 2 was dispensable and could also not compensate effects that the lack of ZO - 1 had on the blood filtration bar - rier . Rather , ZO - 2 may play a supportive role for ZO - 1 in podocyte function . Consistent with this interpretation and our findings , a previous study showed that the over - expression of ZO - 2 in podocytes in vivo improved protection against podo - cyte damages induced by adriamycin treatment ( Bautista - García et al . , 2012 ) . We attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that could explain the differences in the spatiotemporal expression patterns of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 , and found that these molecules had distinctive binding specificities to slit diaphragm integral membrane proteins . Nephrin showed only weak association with ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 . However , whereas NEPH1 bound to both ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 , NEPH3 interacted only with ZO - 1 and not with ZO - 2 . Furthermore , despite being able to interact with both ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in coimmunoprecipitation assays , only ZO - 1 but not ZO - 2 was able to localize NEPH1 at cell – cell contact sites . These results suggested that the differential interaction with NEPH3 and / or different spatiotemporal reg - ulations of NEPH1 due to different subcellular localizations were implicated in the distinctive roles of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in podocytes . While it would be interesting to confirm the localization of NEPH1 and NEPH3 with ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 during podo - cyte differentiation in vivo , these experiments could not be FIGURE 5 Scanning electron microscopic analysis of the glomerulus .

Alternatively , other molecular mechanisms could regulate a differential localization of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 in podocytes ; for example , a molecule specifically interacting with ZO - 2 could interfere with its localization at slit diaphragms . Work is currently in progress to identify podocyte proteins that interact with ZO - 2 but not ZO - 1 . Like tight junctions , slit diaphragms function as a se - lective barrier , and these structures are not only intimately related due to the expression of shared molecules such as ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 , but also physiologically and pathologi - cally . In normal developmental processes of glomerular podocytes , tight junctions are replaced by slit diaphragms ( Putaala et al . , 2001 ) , in contrast , during certain proteinuria - associated glomerular diseases or in particular animal mod - els , tight junctions reappear and replace the degenerated slit diaphragms ( Caulfield , Reid , & Farquhar , 1976 ; Kurihara , Anderson , Kerjaschki , & Farquhar , 1992 ) . Moreover , in vivo introduction of claudin - 1 , a tight junction membrane protein normally absent from the podocyte , induces the transition from slit diaphragms to tight junctions . ( Gong , Sunq , Roth , & Hou , 2017 ) . These mice present proteinuria and podocyte dysfunction , despite the assumption that slit diaphragms are more permeable than tight junctions in epithelial cells because the plasma membrane of adjacent podocytes is not intimately attached as is the case in epi - thelial cells . Thus , while ZO - 1 is indispensable for normal glomerular functions , other tight junction components need to be regulated properly in podocytes for the physiologi - cal blood filtration barrier . Although ZO - 2 is expressed in podocytes , its absence from slit diaphragms may contribute to suppress tight junction formation under normal physio - logical conditions . Further detailed analyses to elucidate precise regulatory mechanisms underlying spatiotemporal expression of tight junction components and slit diaphragm components would contribute toward greater understanding of the glomerular filtration system and possibly open new avenues to prevent or treat glomerular diseases in the future . 4 | EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 4 . 1 | Antibodies Rabbit antibodies against ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 , occludin were ob - tained from Invitrogen ; rat anti - ZO - 1 was from Santa Cruz Biotech ; guinea pig antinephrin was from Progen ; rabbit anti - HA - tag was from Cell Signaling ; mouse anti - Flag - tag was from Sigma - Aldrich ; mouse anti - GAPDH was from Wako ; Alexa Fluor 488 / 594 - conjugated anti - rabbit or anti - guinea pig IgG were from Invitrogen ; HRP - conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotech . 4 . 2 | Cell culture and plasmids COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . The mouse mammary epithelial cell line EpH4 in which the expression of ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 was suppressed by knockout or knockdown , respectively , was cultured as pre - viously described ( Itoh et al . , 2012 ) . Cells at approximately 60 % confluence were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . The HA - tagged ZO - 1 or ZO - 2 plasmids ( pME18S - HA - ZO - 1 , pME18S - HA - ZO - 2 ) were described previously . The Flag - tagged nephrin ( pFLAG - CMV1 - nephrin ) , nephrin with three amino acids deleted from the carboxyl terminal ( pFLAG - CMV1 - nephrinΔCT ) , NEPH1 ( pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH1 ) , NEPH1 with 3 amino acids deleted from the carboxyl terminal ( pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH1ΔCT ) , NEPH3 ( pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH3 ) , NEPH3 with three amino acids deleted from the carboxyl terminal ( pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH3ΔCT ) were pre - pared by subcloning the PCR - amplified cDNA fragments into pFLAG - CMV1 vector ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 4 . 3 | Immunoprecipitation assay COS7 cells transfected with pME18S - HA - ZO - 1 or pME18S - HA - ZO - 2 together with either pFLAG - CMV1 - nephrin , pFLAG - CMV1 - nephrinΔCT , pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH1 , pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH1ΔCT , pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH3 or pFLAG - CMV1 - NEPH3ΔCT were lysed with lysis buffer ( 20 m m Tris - HCl , 150 m m NaCl , 1 m m EDTA , 10 % glyc - erol , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 m m PMSF , pH 7 . 4 ) . The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14 , 000 g for 15 min , and the supernatant was incubated with anti - Flag antibody - conjugated agarose beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 hr . After wash with buffer A , immuno - complex was eluted with flag peptides . The lysates and eluates were analyzed by western blotting . 4 . 4 | SDS - PAGE and western blot analysis One - dimensional SDS - PAGE was carried out with standard protocol , and the separated proteins were transferred from the gels onto PVDF membranes . The membranes were soaked in 5 % skim milk and incubated with the primary antibodies . After being washed with TBS containing 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 ( TBS - T ) , the membranes were incubated with HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies for rabbit or mouse IgG . They were then washed with TBS - T followed by incubation with Clarity Western ECL substrate ( Bio - Rad ) . The signal | 555 Genes to Cells ITOH eT al . was captured using the ChemiDoc system and analyzed by Q uantity O ne software ( Bio - Rad ) . 4 . 5 | Immunofluorescence analysis The cryosections were prepared from frozen kidney tissue samples and fixed with 2 % PFA for 15 min at room tem - perature or with cold methanol for 10 min at −20°C . Cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed with 3 % formalin for 15 min at room temperature . After washing with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , the samples were blocked with 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS and stained with the primary antibodies . Alexa - 488 - or Alexa - 594 - conjugated fluorophores ( Invitrogen ) were used in a final dilution of 1 : 300 as secondary antibodies . Images were taken using confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM 710 ) and processed by zen software ( Zeiss ) . 4 . 6 | Animals Tjp1 flox / flox , Tjp2 flox / flox and Nphs1 - Cre mice , which drive Cre recombinase expression in podocytes under nephrin promoter , were described previously . The podocyte - specific ZO - 2 knockout mice were obtained by cross - ing Tjp2 flox / flox mice and Nphs1 - Cre : Tjp2 flox / + mice , and podocyte - specific ZO - 1 / ZO - 2 double - knockout mice were generated by crossing Tjp1 flox / flox : Tjp2 flox / flox mice and Nphs1 - Cre : Tjp1 flox / + : Tjp2 flox / + . All animal experiments were approved by the committee on research animal care at Dokkyo Medical University ( Permit Number : 06 - 517 ) and conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All efforts were made to minimize suffering including housing mice in a specific pathogen - free unit in which the light cycle was maintained at 12 hr light / 12 hr dark and room temperature was 21 ± 2°C . No more than five mice were housed in one cage and given food and water ad libitum . Mice were killed by terminal anesthesia with isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation . 4 . 7 | Morphological analysis The kidney samples were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 m phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) overnight at 4°C . For the histology , the fixed kidneys were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 2 μm thick - ness . The sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin . For the transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , the kidneys were postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 , dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin . Ultrathin sections were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . For the scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , the kidneys were cut in 1 - mm - thick sections , postfixed with 1 % OsO4 , cryoprotected with 30 % sucrose and freeze - thawed with liquid nitrogen . Then , the blocks were dehydrated , frozen in t - butyl alcohol and sublimated . 4 . 8 | Assessment of proteinuria Mouse urine ( 5 μl ) was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) fol - lowed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining . 4 . 9 | Statistical analyses Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM . Statistical signifi - cance was determined with the Student’s t test or ANOVA . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr . H . Tsukaguchi for providing cDNA encoding nephrin .
