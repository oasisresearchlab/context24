As recently pointed out by the Institute of Medicine , the existing pandemic mitigation models lack the dynamic decision support capability . We develop a large - scale simulation - driven optimization model for generating dynamic predictive distribution of vaccines and antivirals over a network of regional pandemic outbreaks . The model incorporates measures of morbidity , mortality , and social distancing , translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses . The performance of the strategy is compared to that of the reactive myopic policy , using a sample outbreak in Fla , USA , with an a ﬀ ected population of over four millions . The comparison is implemented at di ﬀ erent levels of vaccine and antiviral availability and administration capacity . Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of variability of some critical factors on policy performance . The model is intended to support public health policy making for e ﬀ ective distribution of limited mitigation resources . 1 . Introduction As of July 2010 , WHO has reported 501 conﬁrmed human cases of avian inﬂuenza A / ( H5N1 ) which resulted in 287 deaths worldwide [ 1 ] . At the same time , the statistics for the H1N1 2009 outbreak has so far included 214 countries with a total reported number of infections and deaths of 419 , 289 and 18 , 239 , respectively [ 2 ] . Today , an ominous expectation exists that the next pandemic will be triggered by a highly pathogenic virus , to which there is little or no pre - existing immunity in humans [ 3 ] . The nation’s ability to mitigate a pandemic inﬂuenza de - pends on the available emergency response resources and infrastructure , and , at present , challenges abound . Predicting the exact virus subtype remains a di ﬃ cult task , and even when identiﬁed , reaching an adequate vaccine supply can currently take up to nine months [ 4 , 5 ] . Even if the exi - sting vaccines prove to be potent , their availability will be limited by high production and inventory costs [ 6 , 7 ] and also will be constrained by the supply of antiviral drugs , healthcare providers , hospital beds , medical supplies , and logistics . Hence , pandemic mitigation will have to be done amidst limited availability of resources and supporting infrastructure . This challenge has been acknowledged by WHO [ 7 ] and echoed by the HHS and CDC [ 8 , 9 ] . The existing models on pandemic inﬂuenza ( PI ) con - tainment and mitigation aims to address various complex aspects of the pandemic evolution process including : ( i ) the mechanism of disease progression , from the initial contact and infection transmission to the asymptomatic phase , manifestation of symptoms , and the ﬁnal health outcome [ 10 – 12 ] , ( ii ) the population dynamics , including individual susceptibility [ 13 , 14 ] and transmissibility [ 10 , 15 – 17 ] , and behavioral factors a ﬀ ecting infection generation and e ﬀ ec - tiveness of interventions [ 18 – 20 ] , ( iii ) the impact of phar - maceutical and nonpharmaceutical measures , including vac - cination [ 21 – 23 ] , antiviral therapy [ 24 – 26 ] , social distancing [ 27 – 31 ] and travel restrictions , and the use of low - cost measures , such as face masks and hand washing [ 26 , 32 – 34 ] . Recently , the modeling e ﬀ orts have focused on combin - ing pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions in search for synergistic strategies , aimed at better resource utilization . Most of such approaches attempt implementing a form of social distancing followed by application of pharmaceutical measures . For signiﬁcant contributions in this area see [ 33 , 35 – 41 ] . One of the most notable among 2 Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment these e ﬀ orts is a 2006 - 07 initiative by MIDAS [ 42 ] , which cross - examined independent simulation models of PI spread in rural areas of Asia [ 43 , 44 ] , USA and UK [ 45 , 46 ] , and the city of Chicago [ 47 ] , respectively . MIDAS cross - validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago , with 8 . 6M inhabitants and implementing a targeted layered containment [ 48 , 49 ] . The research ﬁndings of MIDAS and some other groups [ 12 , 33 ] were used in a recent “Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Inﬂuenza” report by IOM , to formulate a set of recommendations for PI mitigation [ 50 ] . These ﬁndings were also used in a pandemic preparedness guidance developed by CDC [ 51 ] . At the same time , The IOM report [ 50 ] points out several limitations of the MIDAS models , observing that “because of the signiﬁcant constraints placed on the models . . . the scope of models should be expanded . ” The IOM recommends “to adapt or develop decision - aid models that can . . . provide real - time feedback . . . and include the costs and beneﬁts of intervention strategies . ” Our literature review yields a similar observation that most existing approaches focus on assessment of a priori deﬁned strategies , and virtually none of the models are capable of “learning , ” that is , adapting to changes in the pandemic progress , or even predicting them , to generate dynamic strategies . Such a strategy has the advantage of being developed dynamically , as the pandemic spreads , by selecting a mix of available mitigation options at each decision epoch , based on both the present state of the pandemic and its predicted evolution . In an attempt to address the IOM recommendations , we present a simulation optimization model for developing predictive resource distribution over a network of regional outbreaks . The underlying simulation model mimics the dis - ease and population dynamics of each of the a ﬀ ected regions ( Sections 2 . 1 and 2 . 2 ) . As the pandemic spreads from region to region , the optimization model distributes mitigation resources , including stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral and administration capacities ( Section 2 . 3 ) . The model seeks to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks , using measures of morbidity , mortality , and social distancing , translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses . The methodology is calibrated and implemented on a sample outbreak in Fla , USA with over 4M inhabitants ( Section 3 ) . The strategy is compared to the reactive myopic policy , which allocates resources from one actual outbreak region to the next , each time trying to cover the entire regional population at risk , regardless of the resource availability . The comparison is done at di ﬀ erent levels of vaccine and antiviral availability and administration capacity . We also present a sensitivity analysis for assessing the impact of variability of some critical factors , including : ( i ) antiviral e ﬃ cacy , ( ii ) social distancing conformance , and ( iii ) CDC response delay . 2 . Methodology The objective of our methodology is to generate a progressive allocation of the total resource availability over a network of regional outbreaks . The methodology incorporates ( i ) a cross - regional simulation model , ( ii ) a set of single - region Outgoing / new outbreak Contained outbreak Actual allocation Virtual allocation Una ﬀ ected region Figure 1 : Schematic of cross - regional pandemic spread and resource distribution . simulation models , and ( iii ) an embedded optimization model . We consider a network of regions with each of which classiﬁed as either una ﬀ ected , ongoing outbreak , or con - tained outbreak ( Figure 1 ) . The cross - regional simulation model connects the regions by air and land travel . The single - region simulation models mimic the population and disease dynamics of each ongoing region , impacted by intervention measures . The pandemic can spread from ongoing to una ﬀ ected regions by infectious travelers who pass through regional border control . At every new regional outbreak epoch , the optimization model allocates available resources to the new outbreak region ( actual distribution ) and una ﬀ ected regions ( virtual distribution ) . Daily statistics is collected for each ongoing region , including the number of infected , deceased , and quarantined cases , for di ﬀ erent age groups . As a regional outbreak is contained , its societal and economic costs are calculated . In Sections 2 . 1 – 2 . 3 , we present the details of the simu - lation and optimization models . A testbed illustration and a comparison of our strategy to the myopic policy is given in Section 3 . 2 . 1 . Cross - Regional Simulation Model . A schematic of the cross - regional simulation model is shown in Figure 2 . The model is initialized by creating population entities and mixing groups , for each region . A pandemic is started by an infectious case injected into a randomly chosen region . The details of the resulting regional contact dynamics and infec - tion transmission are given in Section 2 . 2 . As the infected cases start seeking medical help , a new regional outbreak is detected . A resource distribution is then determined and returned to the single - region model . The outbreak can Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment 3 Begin cross - regional simulation Generate population entities and mixing groups Select initial ( new ) outbreak region Allocate resources to new outbreak region Are there new / ongoing outbreaks ?

Change region status to “contained” Yes No Day begins for each new / ongoing outbreak Figure 2 : Schematic of cross - regional simulation model . spread to una ﬀ ected regions as some infectious travelers pass undetected through the border control . By tracing these travelers , the model determines which of the una ﬀ ected regions , if any , become new outbreaks . The model also determines if any ongoing outbreaks have been contained . The simulation stops when all outbreaks are contained . 2 . 2 . Single - Region Simulation Model . The single - region model subsumes the following components ( see Figure 3 ) : ( i ) population dynamics ( mixing groups and schedules ) , ( ii ) contact and infection process , ( iii ) disease natural history , and ( iv ) mitigation strategies , including social distancing , vaccination , and antiviral application . The model collects detailed statistics , including number of infected , recovered , deceased , and quarantined cases , for di ﬀ erent age groups . For a contained outbreak , its societal and economic costs are calculated . The societal cost includes the cost of lost lifetime productivity of the deceased ; the economic cost includes the cost of medical expenses of the recovered and deceased and the cost of lost productivity of the quarantined [ 52 ] . 2 . 2 . 1 . Mixing Groups and Schedules . Each region is modeled as a set of population centers formed by mixing groups or places where individuals come into contact with each other during the course of their social interaction . Examples of mixing groups include households , o ﬃ ces , schools , univer - sities , shopping centers , entertainment centers , and so forth , [ 53 ] . Each individual is assigned a set of attributes such as age , gender , parenthood , workplace , infection susceptibility , and probability of travel , among others . Each person is also assigned Δ t time - discrete ( e . g . , Δ t = 1 hour ) weekday and weekend schedules , which depend on : ( i ) person’s age , parenthood , and employment status , ( ii ) disease status , ( iii ) travel status , and ( iv ) person’s compliance to social distancing decrees [ 54 ] . As their schedules advance , the individuals circulate throughout the mixing groups and come into contact with each other ( see Section 2 . 2 . 2 ) . It is assumed that at any point of time , an individual belongs to one of the following compartments ( see Figure 4 ) : susceptible , contacted ( by an infectious individual ) , infected ( asymptomatic or symptomatic ) , and recovered / deceased . In what follows , we present the infection transmission and disease natural history model , which delineates the transitions between the above compartments . 2 . 2 . 2 . Contact and Infection Process . Infection transmission occurs during contact events between susceptible and infec - tious cases , which take place in the mixing groups . At the beginning of every Δ t period ( e . g . , one hour ) , for each mixing group g , the simulation tracks the total number of infectious cases , n g , present in the group . It is assumed that each infectious case generates r g per Δ t unit of time new contacts [ 46 ] , chosen randomly ( uniformly ) from the pool of susceptibles present in the group . We also assume the following : ( i ) during Δ t period , a susceptible may come into contact with at most one infectious case and ( ii ) each contact exposure lasts Δ t units of time . Once a susceptible has started her contact exposure at time t , she will develop infection at time t + Δ t with a certain probability that is calculated as shown below . Let L i ( t ) be a nonnegative continuous random variable that represents the duration of contact exposure , starting at time t , required for susceptible i to become infected . We assume that L i ( t ) is distributed exponentially with mean 1 / λ i ( t ) , where λ i ( t ) represents the instantaneous force of infection applied to susceptible i at time t [ 55 – 57 ] . The probability that susceptible i , whose contact exposure has started at time t , will develop infection at time t + Δ t is then given as P { L i ( t ) ≤ Δ t } = 1 − e − λ i ( t ) Δ t .

At the end of the latency phase , she enters the infectious phase [ 44 , 46 , 48 ] . She becomes symptomatic at the end of the incubation period . At the end of the infectious phase , she enters the period leading to a health outcome , which culminates in her recovery or death . Mortality for inﬂuenza - like diseases is a complex process a ﬀ ected by many factors and variables , most of which have limited accurate data support available from past pandemics . Furthermore , the time of death can sometimes be weeks following the disease episode ( which is often attributable to pneumonia - related complications [ 58 ] ) . Because of the uncertainty underlying the mortality process , we adopted an age - based form of the mortality probability of infected i , as follows : m i = μ i (cid:2) 1 − τρ i (cid:3) , ( 2 ) where μ i is the age - dependent base mortality probability of infected i , ρ i is her status of antiviral therapy ( 0 or 1 ) , and τ is the antiviral e ﬃ cacy measured as the relative decrease in the base probability [ 44 ] . We assume that a recovered case develops full immunity but continues circulating in the region . 2 . 2 . 4 . Mitigation Strategies . Mitigation options include phar - maceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions . Mitigation is initiated upon detection of a critical number of conﬁrmed infected cases [ 59 ] , which triggers resource distribution and deployment . The model incorporates a certain delay for deploying ﬁeld responders . Pharmaceutical intervention ( PHI ) includes vaccination and antiviral application . Vaccination is targeted at indi - viduals at risk [ 60 ] to reduce their infection susceptibility . The vaccine takes a certain period to become e ﬀ ective [ 61 ] . Vaccination is constrained by the allocated stockpile and administration capacity , measured in terms of the immunizer - hours . We assume that as some symptomatic cases seek medical help [ 62 , 63 ] , those at risk of them will receive an antiviral . The process is constrained by the allocated stockpile and administration capacity , measured in terms of the number of certiﬁed providers . Both vaccination and antiviral application are a ﬀ ected by a number of sociobehavioral factors , including conformance of the target population , degree of risk perception , and com - pliance of healthcare personnel [ 64 – 66 ] . The conformance level of the population at risk can be a ﬀ ected , among other factors , by the demographics and income level [ 67 – 71 ] as well as by the quality of public information available [ 54 ] . The degree of risk perception can be inﬂuenced by the neg - ative experience developed during previous pharmaceutical campaigns [ 72 , 73 ] , as well as by public fear and rumors [ 74 , 75 ] . Nonpharmaceutical intervention ( NPI ) includes social distancing and travel restrictions . We adopted a CDC guidance [ 51 ] , which establishes ﬁve categories of pandemic severity and recommends quarantine and closure options according to the category . The categories are determined based on the value of the case fatality ratio ( CFR ) , the proportion of fatalities in the total infected population . For CFR values lower than 0 . 1 % ( Category 1 ) , voluntary at - home isolation of infected cases is implemented . For CFR values Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment 5 between 0 . 1 % and 1 . 0 % ( Categories 2 and 3 ) , in addition to at - home isolation , the following measures are recommended : ( i ) voluntary quarantine of household members of infected cases and ( ii ) child and adult social distancing . For CFR values exceeding 1 . 0 % ( Categories 4 and 5 ) , all the above measures are implemented . As the e ﬀ ectiveness of social distancing is a ﬀ ected by some of the behavioral factors listed above [ 54 ] , we assume a certain social distancing conformance level . Travel restrictions considered in the model included regional air and land border control for infected travelers . 2 . 3 . Optimization Model . As presented in Figure 2 , the optimization model is invoked at the beginning of every n th new regional outbreak epoch ( n = 1 , 2 , . . . ) , starting from the initial outbreak region ( n = 1 ) . The objective of the model is to allocate some of the available mitigation resources to the new outbreak region ( actual distribution ) while reserving the rest of the quantities for potential outbreak regions ( virtual distribution ) . By doing so , the model seeks to progressively minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks , spreading from the ongoing locations . Mitigation resources can include stockpiles of vaccines and antivirals , administration capacity , hospital beds , medical supplies , and social distancing enforcement resources , among others . The predictive mechanism of the optimization model is based on a set of regression equations obtained using single - region simulation models . In what follows , we present the construction of the optimization model and explain the solution algorithm for the overall simulation - based optimization methodology . We introduce the following general terminology and notation : S : Set of all network regions A n : Set of regions in which pandemic is contained at the n th outbreak epoch ( n = 1 , 2 , . . . ) B n : Set of ongoing regions at the n th outbreak epoch C n : Set of una ﬀ ected regions at the n th outbreak epoch R : Set of available types of mitigation resources ( R = { 1 , 2 , . . . , r } ) q ik : Amount of resource i allocated to region k Q ni : Available amount of resource i ∈ R at the n th outbreak epoch H : Set of age groups . The optimization criterion ( objective function ) of the model incorporates measures of expected societal and economic costs of the pandemic : the societal cost includes the cost of lost lifetime productivity of the deceased ; the economic cost includes the cost of medical expenses of the recovered and deceased and the cost of lost productivity of the quarantined . To compute these costs , the following impact measures of morbidity , mortality , and quarantine are used , for each region k : X hk : Total number of infected cases in age group h who seek medical assistance Y hk : Total number of infected cases in age group h who do not seek medical assistance D hk : Total number of deceased cases in age group h V hk : Total number of person - days of cases in age group h who comply with quarantine . To estimate these measures , we use the following regression models obtained using a single - region simulation of each region k : X hk = δ 0 hk + (cid:4) i ∈ R δ ihk · q ik + (cid:4) i , m ∈ R , i / = m δ imhk · q ik · q mk , ( 3 ) where δ i ·· denotes the regression coe ﬃ cient associated with resource i and δ im ·· is the regression coe ﬃ cient for the interaction between resources i and m . Similar models are used for Y hk , D hk , and V hk . The above relationships between the impact measures and the resource distributions ought to be determined a priori of implementing a cross - regional scenario ( see Section 3 ) . Here , we consider each region k as the initial outbreak region . We assume , however , that as the pandemic evolves , the disease infectivity will naturally subside . Hence , the regression equations need to be re - estimated at every new outbreak epoch , for each region k ∈ C n , using the single - region simulation models , where each simulation must be initialized to the current outbreak status in region k in the cross - regional simulation . As an alternative to using a computationally burdensome approach of re - estimating the regression equations , a modeler may choose to use a certain decay factor α n [ 76 ] to adjust the estimates of the regional impact measures at every n th outbreak epoch , in the following way : X nhj = α n X hj , Y nhj = α n Y hj , D nhj = α n D hj , V nhj = α n V hj . ( 4 ) In addition , we use the following regression model to estimate the probability of pandemic spread from a ﬀ ected region l to una ﬀ ected region k , as a function of resources allocated to region l , which , in turn , impact the number of outgoing infectious travelers from the region : p lk = γ 0 lk + (cid:4) i ∈ R γ ilk · q il + (cid:4) i , m ∈ R i / = m γ imlk · q il · q ml , ( 5 ) where γ i ·· denotes the regression coe ﬃ cient associated with resource i , γ im ·· is the regression coe ﬃ cient associated with interaction between resources i and m , and γ 0 ·· represents the intercept . Consequently , the total outbreak probability for una ﬀ ected region k can be found as p k = (cid:5) l ∈ B n p lk . As in the case of the impact measures , the estimates of the regional outbreak probabilities need to be progressively re - estimated or adjusted using a scheme similar to ( 4 ) , as follows : p n k = α n p k . ( 6 ) 6 Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment Finally , we calculate the total cost of an outbreak in region k at the n th decision epoch as follows : TC nk = (cid:4) h ∈ H ( m h + w h ) X nhk + (cid:4) h ∈ H w h · Y nhk + (cid:4) h ∈ H (cid:6) w h · D nhk + (cid:4) h ∈ H w h · V nhk , ( 7 ) where m h is total medical cost of an infected case in age group h over his / her disease period , w h is total cost of lost wages of an infected case in age group h over his / her disease period , (cid:6) w h is cost of lost lifetime wages of a deceased case in age group h , and w h is daily cost of lost wages of a non - infected case in age group h who complies with quarantine . The model . The optimization model has the following form . Minimize TC n j (cid:7) q 1 j , q 2 j , . . . , q rj (cid:8) + (cid:4) s ∈ C n TC ns (cid:2) q 1 s , q 2 s , . . . , q rs (cid:3) · p ns subject to q ij + (cid:4) s ∈ C n q is · p ns ≤ Q ni ∀ i ∈ R , q ij , q is ≥ 0 ∀ i ∈ R . ( 8 ) The ﬁrst term of the objective function represents the total cost of the new outbreak j , estimated at the n th outbreak epoch , based on the actual resource distribution { q 1 j , q 2 j , . . . , q rj } ( see ( 7 ) ) . The second term represents the total expected cost of outbreaks in currently una ﬀ ected regions , based on the virtual distributions { q 1 s , q 2 s , . . . , q rs } ( 7 ) and the regional outbreak probabilities p ns ( 6 ) . The set of constraints assures that for each resource i , the total quantity allocated ( current and virtual , both nonnegative ) does not exceed the total resource availability at the n th decision epoch . Note that both the objective function and the availability constraints are nonlinear in the decision variables . 2 . 4 . Solution Algorithm . The solution algorithm for our dynamic predictive simulation optimization ( DPO ) model is given below .

Testbed Illustration To illustrate the use of our methodology , we present a sample H5N1 outbreak scenario including four counties in Fla , USA : Hillsborough , Miami Dade , Duval , and Leon , with populations of 1 . 0 , 2 . 2 , 0 . 8 , and 0 . 25 million people , respectively . A basic unit of time for population and disease dynamics models was taken to be Δ t = 1 hour . Regional simulations were run for a period ( up to 180 days ) until the daily infection rate approached near zero ( see Section 3 . 3 ) . Below , we present the details on selecting model parameter values . Most of the testbed data can be found in the supplement [ 77 ] . 3 . 1 . Parameter Values for Population and Disease Dynamics Models . Demographic and social dynamics data for each region [ 77 ] were extracted from the U . S . Census [ 78 ] and the National Household Travel Survey [ 79 ] . Daily ( hourly ) schedules [ 77 ] were adopted from [ 53 ] . Each infected person was assigned a daily travel prob - ability of 0 . 24 % [ 79 ] , of which 7 % was by air and 93 % by land . The probabilities of travel among the four regions were calculated using tra ﬃ c volume data [ 80 – 83 ] , see Table 1 . Infection detection probabilities for border control for symptomatic cases were assumed to be 95 % and 90 % , for air and land , respectively [ 84 ] . The instantaneous force of infection applied to contact i at time t ( ( 1 ) , [ 57 ] ) was modeled as λ i ( t ) = − ln (cid:2) 1 − p i ( t ) (cid:3) , where p i ( t ) = α i − δθ i ( t ) , ( 9 ) Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment 7 Table 1 : Interregional travel probabilities .

The values of age - dependent base instantaneous infec - tion probabilities were adopted from [ 46 ] ( see Table 2 ) . The disease natural history included a latent period of 29 hours ( 1 . 21 days ) , an incubation period of 46 hours ( 1 . 92 days ) , an infectiousness period from 29 to 127 hours ( 1 . 21 to 5 . 29 days ) , and a period leading to health outcome from 127 to 240 hours ( 5 . 29 to 10 days ) [ 85 ] . Base mortality probabilities ( μ i in ( 2 ) ) were found using the statistics recommended by the Working Group on Pan - demic Preparedness and Inﬂuenza Response [ 52 ] . This data shows the percentage of mortality for age - based high - risk cases ( HRC ) ( Table 3 , columns 1 – 3 ) . Mortality probabilities ( column 4 ) were estimated under the assumption that high - risk cases are expected to account for 85 % of the total number of fatalities , for each age group [ 52 ] . 3 . 2 . Calibration of the Single - Region Models . Single - region simulation models were calibrated using two common measures of pandemic severity [ 35 , 45 , 46 ] : the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) and the infection attack rate ( IAR ) . R 0 is deﬁned as the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infected case in a totally susceptible population . IAR is deﬁned as the ratio of the total number of infections over the pandemic period to the size of the initial susceptible population . To determine R 0 , all infected cases inside the simulation were classiﬁed by generation of infection , as in [ 33 , 43 ] . The value of R 0 was calculated as the average reproduction number of a typical generation in the early stage of the pandemic , with no interventions implemented ( the baseline scenario ) [ 33 ] . Historically , R 0 values for PI ranged between 1 . 4 and 3 . 9 [ 37 , 43 ] . To attain similar values , we calibrated the hourly contact rates of mixing groups [ 77 ] ( original rates were adopted from [ 46 ] ) . For the four regions , the average baseline value of R 0 was 2 . 54 , which represented a high transmissibility scenario . The values of regional baseline IAR averaged 0 . 538 . 3 . 3 . Parameters of Mitigation . Mitigation resources included stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral and administration capacities ( Section 3 . 4 ) . A 24 - hour delay was assumed for deployment of resources and ﬁled responders [ 59 ] . PHI . The vaccination risk group included healthcare providers [ 66 ] , and individuals younger than 5 years ( exclud - ing younger than 12 months old ) and older than 65 years [ 60 ] . The risk group for antiviral included symptomatic individuals below 15 years and above 55 years [ 60 , 86 ] . The e ﬃ cacy levels for the vaccine ( δ in ( 9 ) ) and antiviral ( τ in ( 2 ) ) were assumed to be 40 % [ 44 , 87 ] and 70 % , respectively . We did not consider the use of antiviral for a mass prophylactic reduction of infection susceptibility due to the limited antiviral availability [ 9 ] and the risk of emergence of antiviral resistant transmissible virus strains [ 26 ] . We assumed a 90 % target population conformance for both vaccination and antiviral treatment [ 64 ] . The immunity development period for the vaccine was taken as 10 days [ 61 ] . NPI . A version of the CDC guidance for quarantine and isolation for Category 5 was implemented ( Section 2 . 2 . 4 , [ 51 ] ) . Once the reported CFR value had reached 1 . 0 % , the following policy was declared and remained in e ﬀ ect for 14 days [ 51 ] : ( i ) individuals below a certain age ξ ( 22 years ) stayed at home during the entire policy duration , ( ii ) of the remaining population , a certain proportion φ [ 88 ] stayed at home and was allowed a one - hour leave , every three days , to buy essential supplies , and ( iii ) the remaining ( 1 − φ ) noncompliant proportion followed a regular schedule . All testbed scenarios considered the quarantine conformance level φ equal to 80 % [ 54 ] . An outbreak was considered contained , if the daily infec - tion rate did not exceed ﬁve cases , for seven consecutive days . Once contained , a region was simulated for an additional 10 days for accurate estimation of the pandemic statistics . A 2 5 statistical design of experiment [ 89 ] was used to estimate the regression coe ﬃ cient values of the signiﬁcant decision factors and their interactions ( see Section 2 . 3 ; the values of adjusted R 2 ranged from 96 . 36 % to 99 . 97 % ) . The simulation code was developed using C + + . The run - ning time for a cross - regional simulation replicate involving over four million inhabitants was between 17 and 26 minutes ( depending on the initial outbreak region , with a total of 150 replicates ) on a Pentium 3 . 40 GHz with 4 . 0 GB of RAM . 3 . 4 . Comparison of DPO and Myopic Strategies . The per - formance of the DPO and myopic policies is compared at di ﬀ erent levels of resource availability .

Table 5 shows the per capita costs of lost productivity and medical expenses , which were adopted from [ 52 ] and adjusted for inﬂation for the year of 2010 [ 90 ] . Comparison of the two strategies is done at the levels of 20 % , 50 % , and 80 % of the total resource requirement shown in Table 4 . Figures 6 ( a ) and 6 ( b ) show the policy comparison in the form of the 95 % conﬁdence intervals ( CI ) for the average number of infected and deceased , respectively . Figure 7 also shows the policy comparison using the 95 % CI for the average total pandemic cost , calculated using the pandemic statistics , and the per capita costs from Table 5 . For illustrative purposes , we also show the average number of regional outbreaks , for each policy , at di ﬀ erent levels of resource availability , in the testbed scenario involving four regions , with the Hillsborough as the initial outbreak region ( Table 6 ) . It can be observed that the values of all impact measures exhibit a downward trend , for both DPO and myopic policies , as the total resource availability increases from 20 % to 80 % . An increased total resource availability not only helps alleviating the pandemic impact inside the ongoing regions but also reduces the probability of spread to the una ﬀ ected regions . For both policies , as the total resource availability approaches the total resource requirement ( starting from approximately 60 % ) , the impact numbers show a converging behavior , whereby the marginal utility of additional resource availability diminishes . This behavior can be explained by noting that the total resource requirements were determined assuming the worst case scenario when all ( four ) regions would be a ﬀ ected and ought to provided with enough resources to cover their respective regional populations at risk . It can also be seen that on average , the DPO policy outperforms the myopic approach at all levels , which can attest to a more e ﬃ cient resource utilization achieved by the DPO policy ( see also Table 6 ) . The di ﬀ erence in the policy performance is particularly noticeable at the lower levels of resource availability , and it gradually diminishes , as the resource availability increases and becomes closer to be su ﬃ cient to cover the entire populations at risk in all regions . It can also be noted that the variability in the performance of the DPO strategy is generally smaller than that of the myopic policy . In general , for both strategies , the performance variability decreases with higher availability of resources . 3 . 5 . Sensitivity Analysis . In this section , we assess the marginal impact of variability of some of the critical factors . The impact was measured separately by the change in the total pandemic cost and the number of deaths ( averaged over multiple replicates ) , resulting from a unit change in a decision factor value , one factor at a time . Factors under consideration included : ( i ) antiviral e ﬃ cacy , ( ii ) social distancing conformance , and ( iii ) CDC response delay . We have used all four regions , separately , as initial outbreak regions for each type of sensitivity analysis . The results ( patterns ) were rather similar . Due to limited space , we have opted to show the results for only one initial region , chosen arbitrarily , for each of the three types of sensitivity studies . While Duval County was selected as the initial outbreak region to show the sensitivity results on antiviral e ﬃ cacy , Hillsborough and Miami Dade were used as the initial Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment 9 20 50 80 Total resource availability relative to total requirement ( % ) DPO policy Myopic policy 1 . 629 1 . 531 1 . 229 2 . 405 1 . 942 1 . 315 823 679 805 1 . 091 722 871 600 1100 1600 2100 2600 95 % C I f o r a v e r a g e t o t a l i n f e c t e d c a s e s ( t h o u s a n d s ) ( a ) 100 . 926 75 . 16 51 . 722 162 . 271 103 . 01 54 . 847 36 . 307 25 . 892 34 . 786 59 . 243 24 . 210 38 . 266 10 55 100 145 190 × 10 3 95 % C I f o r a v e r a g e t o t a l d e a t h s 20 50 80 Total resource availability relative to total requirement ( % ) DPO policy Myopic policy ( b ) Figure 6 : Comparison of DPO and myopic policies ( average number infected 6 ( a ) and deaths 6 ( b ) ) . 96 . 05 83 . 18 57 . 39 150 . 48 105 . 97 61 . 23 40 . 19 28 . 64 38 . 64 62 . 49 29 . 76 41 . 94 20 45 70 95 120 145 170 20 50 80 Total resource availability relative to total requirement ( % ) DPO policy Myopic policy 95 % C I f o r a v e r a g e t o t a l c o s t ( $ B ) Figure 7 : DPO versus myopic ( total cost ) . regions to show the results on , respectively , social distancing conformance and CDC response delay . 3 . 5 . 1 . Antiviral E ﬃ cacy . Figure 8 depicts the sensitivity of the average total cost and average total deaths to antiviral e ﬃ cacy values between 0 % and 80 % . As expected , for both policies , the curves for the average number of deaths exhibit a decreasing trend which is almost linear for the values of τ between 0 % and 40 % . As the value of τ approaches 70 % , the curves start exhibit a converging behavior . The curves for the average total pandemic cost exhibit a similar pattern for both policies . It can be noted that the performance of both policies is somewhat identical for low antiviral e ﬃ cacy ( between 0 % and 30 % ) . However , the performance of the DPO policy improves consistently as τ increases which can be attributed to a more discretionary allocation of the antiviral stockpile by the DPO policy . 3 . 5 . 2 . Social Distancing Conformance . Reduction of the con - tact intensity through quarantine and social distancing has proven to be one of the most e ﬀ ective containment measures , especially in the early stages of the pandemic [ 27 , 30 , 31 , 41 ] . Figure 9 shows the sensitivity of the average total cost and average total deaths to the social distancing conformance ranging between 60 % and 80 % . We observed that for both impact measures , the DPO policy demonstrated a better performance with the di ﬀ erence ranging from $ 3B to $ 26B in the total cost and from 1 , 400 to 20 , 000 in the number of fatalities . The biggest di ﬀ erence in performance was achieved at the lower - to - medium levels of conformance ( between 65 % and 72 % ) . As the conformance level approached 80 % , the dominating impact of social distancing masked the e ﬀ ect of better utilization of vaccines and antivirals achieved by the DPO strategy . 3 . 5 . 3 . CDC Response Delay . The CDC response delay corre - sponds to the interval of time from the moment an outbreak is detected to a complete deployment of mitigation resources . Depending on the disease infectivity , CDC response delay may represent one of the most critical factors in the mitigation process . Figure 10 shows how the performance of both policies was signiﬁcantly impacted by this factor . The DPO policy showed a uniformly better performance with the di ﬀ erence 10 Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment 0 20 40 60 80 20 35 50 65 80 A v e r a g e t o t a l c o s t ( b i ll i o n $ ) Antiviral e ﬃ cacy ( % ) DPO policy Myopic policy ( a ) 0 15 30 45 60 A v e r a g e t o t a l d e a t h s DPO policy Myopic policy 0 20 40 60 80 Antiviral e ﬃ cacy ( % ) × 10 3 ( b ) Figure 8 : Sensitivity analysis for antiviral e ﬃ cacy .

For both policies , there was no signiﬁcant di ﬀ erence when the delay was between 24 and 48 hours . However , for the delay values exceeding 48 hours , the average number of deaths and total cost increased at a high rate .

Conclusions As recently pointed by the IOM , the existing models for PI mitigation fall short of providing dynamic decision support which would incorporate “the costs and beneﬁts of interven - tion” [ 50 ] . In this paper , we present a large - scale simulation optimization model which is attempted at ﬁlling this gap . The model supports dynamic predictive resource distri - bution over a network of regions exposed to the pandemic . The model aims to balance both the ongoing and potential outbreak impact , which is measured in terms of morbidity , mortality , and social distancing , translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses . The model was calibrated using historic pandemic data and compared to the myopic strategy , using a sample outbreak in Fla , USA , with over 4 million inhabitants . Summary of the main results . In the testbed scenario , for both strategies , the marginal utility of additional resource availability was found to be diminishing , as the total resource availability approached the total requirement . In the testbed scenario , the DPO strategy on average outperformed the myopic policy . As opposed to the DPO strategy , the myopic policy is reactive , rather than predictive , as it allocates resources regardless of the remaining avail - ability and the overall cross - regional pandemic status . In contrast , the DPO model distributes resources trying to bal - ance the impact of actual outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks . It does so by exploiting region - speciﬁc e ﬀ ectiveness of mitigation resources and dynamic reassessment of pandemic spread probabilities , using a set of regression submodels . Hence , we believe that in scenarios involving regions with a more heterogeneous demographics , the DPO policy will likely to perform even better and with less variability than the myopic strategy . We also note that the di ﬀ erence in the model performance was particularly notice - able at lower levels of resource availability , which is in accor - dance with a higher marginal utility of additional availability at that levels . We thus believe that the DPO model can be particularly useful in scenarios with very limited resources . Contributions of the paper . The simulation optimization methodology presented in this paper is one of the ﬁrst attempts to o ﬀ er dynamic predictive decision support for pandemic mitigation , which incorporates measures of soci - etal and economic costs . Our comparison study of the DPO versus myopic cross - regional resource distribution is also novel . Additionally , our simulation model represents one of the ﬁrst of its kind in considering a broader range of social behavioral aspects , including vaccination and antiviral treatment conformance . The simulation features a ﬂexible design which can be particularized to a broader range of PHI and NPI and even more granular mixing groups . We also developed a decision - aid simulator which is made available to the general public through our web site at http : / / imse . eng . usf . edu / pandemics . aspx . The tool is inten - ded to assist public health decision makers in implement - ing what - if analysis for assessment of mitigation options and development of policy guidelines . Examples of such guidelines include vaccine and antiviral risk groups , social distancing policies ( e . g . , thresholds for declaration / lifting and closure options ) , and travel restrictions . Limitations of the model . Lack of reliable data prevented us from considering geo - spatial aspects of mixing group formation . We also did not consider the impact of public education and the use of personal protective measures ( e . g . , 12 Inﬂuenza Research and Treatment face masks ) on transmission , again due to a lack of e ﬀ ective - ness data [ 91 ] . We did not study the marginal e ﬀ ectiveness of individual resources due to a considerable uncertainty about the transmissibility of an emerging pandemic virus and e ﬃ cacy of vaccine and antiviral . For the same reason , the vaccine and antiviral risk groups considered in the testbed can be adjusted , as di ﬀ erent prioritization schemes have been suggested . The form of social distancing implemented in the testbed can also be modiﬁed as a variety of schemes can be found in the literature , including those based on geographical and social targeting . E ﬀ ectiveness of these approaches is substantially inﬂuenced by the compliance factor , for which limited accurate data support exists . It will thus be vital to gather the most detailed data on the epidemiology of a new virus and the population dynamics early in the evolution of a pandemic , and expeditiously analyze the data to adjust the interventions accordingly .
