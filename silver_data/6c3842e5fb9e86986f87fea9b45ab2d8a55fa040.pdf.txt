However , the functional signiﬁcance of this con - jugation has not been fully clariﬁed . We sought to exam - ine RanGAP1 behavior during mitosis . We found that RanGAP1 associates with mitotic spindles and that it is particularly concentrated at foci near kinetochores . As - sociation with kinetochores appeared soon after nuclear envelope breakdown and persisted until late anaphase , but it was lost coincident with nuclear envelope assembly in telophase . A mutant RanGAP1 protein lacking the capacity R to be conjugated to SUMO - 1 no longer associated with spindles , indicating that conjugation was essential for RanGAP1’s mitotic localization . RanBP2 , a nuclear pore protein that binds SUMO - 1 – conjugated RanGAP1 during interphase , colocalized with RanGAP1 on spindles , suggest - ing that a complex between these two proteins may be involved in mitotic targeting of RanGAP1 . This report shows for the ﬁrst time that SUMO - 1 conjugation is required for mitotic localization of RanGAP1 , and suggests that a major role of SUMO - 1 conjugation to RanGAP1 may be the spatial regulation of the Ran pathway during mitosis . Introduction Ran is a GTPase that is required for nuclear transport , cell cycle control , mitotic spindle formation , and postmitotic nuclear assembly ( for review see Sazer and Dasso , 2000 ) . Ran is regulated by a cytosolic GTPase – activating protein , RanGAP1 , and by a chromatin - bound nucleotide exchange factor , RCC1 ( Sazer and Dasso , 2000 ) . The distribution of Ran - GTP provides important spatial information that directs cellular activities during different parts of the cell cycle ( for review see Dasso , 2001 ) . During interphase , the localization of RCC1 and RanGAP1 predicts that nuclear Ran is GTP - bound and cytosolic Ran is GDP - bound . This compartmentalization determines the direction of nuclear transport by promoting the loading and unloading of transport receptors in a manner that is appropriate to the nucleus or cytosol ( Gorlich and Kutay , 1999 ) . In mitosis , microtubules ( MTs ) * are stabilized in the vicinity of chromatin by a factor ( s ) whose concentration is inversely proportional to distance from chromosomes ( for review see Dasso , 2001 ) . This stabilization contributes toward the assembly of bipolar mitotic spindles . Ran is implicated in spindle assembly through observations in M - phase Xenopus egg extracts , including the finding that elevated levels of Ran - GTP promote spontaneous MT polymerization in a manner that is independent of chromosomes ( Dasso , 2001 ) . Since a significant fraction of RCC1 remains chromatin - associated in mitosis ( Carazo - Salas et al . , 1999 ) , it has been hypothesized that Ran - GTP could be a diffusionally distributed stabilization factor that contributes to the localized stabilization of MTs near condensed chromosomes . Given the proposed roles of Ran - GTP as a spatial signal during both interphase and mitosis , knowledge of the distribu - tion of Ran’s regulators will be essential for understanding the control and function of this pathway . We have been particularly interested in understanding how RanGAP1 is distributed as cells progress through mitosis . In metazoans , RanGAP1 is con - jugated with SUMO - 1 , a small ubiquitin - like protein ( Matu - nis et al . , 1996 ; Mahajan et al . , 1997 ; Saitoh et al . , 1997 ) . SUMO - 1 shares only (cid:2) 18 % identity with ubiquitin at the amino acid level , and it is covalently linked through isopeptide bonds to lysine residues in other target proteins in a manner that is very similar to ubiquitin ( for review see Melchior , 2000 ) . The activity of SUMO - 1 – conjugated RanGAP1 ( Ran - GAP1 – SUMO - 1 ) as a Ran GTPase – activating protein is not substantially altered ( Saitoh et al . , 1997 ) . However , SUMO - 1 modification causes RanGAP1 to associate with RanBP2 , a Address correspondence to Mary Dasso , Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Development , National Institute of Child Health and Development , National Institutes of Health , Building 18T , Room 106 , 18 Library Dr . , MSC 5431 , Bethesda , MD 20892 .

The association of RanGAP1 with RanBP2 may facilitate nuclear transport . This idea is supported by the capacity of antibodies to block transport by inhibiting pore - associated RanGAP1 ( Mahajan et al . , 1997 ) . However , yeast homologues of RanGAP1 are not subject to SUMO - 1 modification , nor is the necessity for tight association of RanGAP1 with the pore obvious from our current knowledge of nuclear transport ( Gorlich and Kutay , 1999 ) . Alternatively , it is possible that SUMO - 1 modification of RanGAP1 could shape Ran - GTP gradients in mitosis or promote the repolariza - tion of Ran - GTP across the nuclear envelope as nuclei assemble after mitosis . Consistent with the former idea , RanGAP1 asso - ciates with the spindle during mitosis ( Matunis et al . , 1996 ) . However , it has not been shown how this association is achieved or regulated . We sought to examine the behavior of RanGAP1 during the passage of cells through mitosis . We found that RanGAP1 localized to mitotic spindles and kinetochores . Binding to spindles was dependent upon the SUMO - 1 conjugation of RanGAP1 , revealing a novel role for this modification in lo - calizing RanGAP1 during mitosis . When compared with RanGAP1 – SUMO - 1 , RanBP2 showed an overlapping but nonidentical distribution , indicating that the complex between these proteins may be maintained in mitosis and serve as part of the mechanism whereby RanGAP1 targets to the spindle . These observations have important implications for models of spindle assembly that rely upon the mitotic distribution of Ran - GTP . Results and discussion RanGAP1 associates with the mitotic spindle A fraction of RanGAP1 is targeted to the nuclear pore during interphase ( Matunis et al . , 1996 ; Mahajan et al . , 1997 ) . This fraction can be visualized by immunofluorescence if cells are treated briefly with digitonin before fixation to release soluble cytoplasmic RanGAP1 protein . Using similar strategies , it was demonstrated that a portion of RanGAP1 is associated with the mitotic spindle ( Matunis et al . , 1996 ) , although the mech - anism of this targeting has not been reported . We wished to determine more precisely where RanGAP1 localized on the spindle . In initial experiments , we stained digitonin - permeabilized HeLa cells with antibodies against RanGAP1 ( Matunis et al . , 1996 ) and either anti – (cid:2) - tubulin antibodies to visualize spindle MTs ( Fig . 1 ) or anti – (cid:3) - tubulin antibodies to visualize centrosomes ( Fig . 2 A ) . The cells were also stained with the DNA dye DAPI . Mitotic cells were identified through their chromosome morphology and pho - tographed . We found that RanGAP1 associates with the body of the spindle , but that this association did not extend into the immediate vicinity of spindle poles : RanGAP1 ex - tensively overlapped with (cid:2) - tubulin , except at the poles ( Fig . 1 ) , but RanGAP1 did not colocalize extensively with (cid:3) - tubu - lin ( Fig . 2 A ) . A second site of RanGAP1 staining was a series of prominent dots corresponding to the plus ends of the ki - netochore MTs visualized by anti - (cid:2) - tubulin staining ( Fig . 1 ) . Repetition of this experiment with two other independently generated antibodies against RanGAP1 ( Mahajan et al . , 1998 ; Saitoh et al . , 1997 ) gave essentially identical results . For a more precise examination of the second RanGAP1 population , we performed coimmunofluorescence using anti - RanGAP1 antibodies and CREST sera , which con - tain human autoantibodies against centromeric proteins ( Fig . 3 A ) . We observed that RanGAP1 and CREST stain - ing were distinct in interphase , when RanGAP1 associated with pores and CREST antigens resided within the nu - cleus . After nuclear envelope breakdown , these two pat - terns came into juxtaposition . Their relative distribution was particularly striking in metaphase : as chromosomes Figure 1 . RanGAP1 localizes to spindles in a microtubule - dependent manner . HeLa cells were untreated or treated with 2 (cid:4) M nocodazole for 2 h and then permeabilized with digitonin and fixed in formaldehyde . The cells were stained for (cid:2) - tubulin ( green ) and RanGAP1 ( red ) using specific antibodies and counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) for DNA . on J u l y 9 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m SUMO - 1 targets RanGAP1 to the mitotic spindle | Joseph et al . 597 aligned on the metaphase plate , each dot of CREST stain - ing was associated with a single dot of RanGAP1 staining , located immediately adjacent to and poleward from the centromere ( Fig . 3 B ) . RanGAP1 and CREST staining continued to be closely associated through anaphase . This close association became much less apparent when cells entered telophase , as the nuclear envelope reformed and RanGAP1 again associated with pores . These observations suggest that RanGAP1 is localized on or very near kineto - chores through much of mitosis . To determine whether RanGAP1 depended upon MTs for its targeting to kinetochores , we examined cells that had been treated with 2 (cid:4) M nocodazole for 2 h ( at which time the MTs are almost completely disrupted ) before dig - itonin permeabilization , fixation , and staining ( Fig . 1 ) . In this case , there was no digitonin - resistant RanGAP1 stain - ing in mitotically arrested cells with condensed chromo - somes . The lack of such staining suggests either that the ki - netochore sites to which RanGAP1 is targeted contain MTs , or that the binding site for RanGAP1 is unstable when microtubules are disrupted . It has been widely suggested that gradients of Ran - GTP could help to orient the mitotic spindle in metazoans by locally stabilizing MTs in the vicinity of chromosomes , based upon the localization of Ran’s nucleotide exchange factor , RCC1 ( for review see Dasso , 2001 ; Kahana and Cleveland , 2001 ) . While this is an attractive model , it is likely that the true situation is more complicated and that the location of other Ran pathway components can play a role in regulating Ran - GTP distribution . In particular , our observations suggest that RanGAP1 localization on the spindle and kinetochores could locally alter the concentra - tions of Ran - GTP available to mediate MT stabilization . It was therefore of interest to determine how RanGAP1 was targeted to the spindle and how such an association might be regulated . SUMO - 1 conjugation targets RanGAP1 to the spindle during mitosis We wished to determine whether SUMO - 1 plays a role in RanGAP1’s targeting to the spindle during mitosis . To do this , we transfected a pDsRed1 - N1 vector expressing a fu - sion of human RanGAP1 and the red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) ( RanGAP1 - RFP ) into HeLa cells . In all cases , we si - multaneously cotransfected the cells with a GFP – histone H2B marker to unambiguously identify the transfected cells . We performed several experiments to verify that RanGAP1 - RFP serves as a reliable indicator of RanGAP1 behavior and localization : RanGAP1 - RFP was subject to modification by SUMO - 1 ( Fig . 4 A , lane 2 ) and localized in a manner that was indistinguishable from endogenous RanGAP1 in inter - phase ( unpublished data ) . It also localized in a pattern re - sembling the endogenous RanGAP1 during mitosis ( Fig . 4 B ) , suggesting that the targeting of RanGAP1 to spindles was not compromised by fusion to the RFP moiety . Notably , we observed that kinetochore - associated Ran - GAP1 - RFP was brighter in comparison to the microtu - bule - associated RanGAP1 - RFP signal than would have been anticipated from immunofluorescence experiments ( com - pare Fig . 1 to Fig . 4 C ) . While there are several possible explanations for this difference , we suspect that kineto - chore - associated RanGAP1 was under represented by im - munofluorescence due to restricted accessibility to anti - bodies . Although we have not quantitated the amounts of RanGAP1 on kinetochores and other parts of spindles , it is our feeling that kinetochores are likely to be the most con - centrated site of RanGAP1 localization during metaphase . Mutation of a single acceptor lysine in mouse RanGAP1 ( RanGAP1 - K526R ) can abolish interphase RanGAP1 con - jugation to SUMO - 1 and simultaneously disrupt its associa - tion with nuclear pores ( Matunis et al . , 1998 ) . We made a homologous mutation in the human RanGAP1 fusion pro - tein ( RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP ) , and observed that it abol - ished SUMO - 1 conjugation ( Fig . 4 A , lane 3 ) . We identified transfected mitotic cells by the presence of the GFP – histone H2B marker and examined the localization of RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP . In all nonpermeabilized cells in which the GFP – histone H2B marker was visible , we also saw clear ex - pression of RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP ( unpublished data ) . As predicted , we found that RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP did not as - sociate with pores in digitonin - permeabilized interphase cells ( unpublished data ) . Figure 2 .

Cells were permeabilized , fixed , and stained for DNA using DAPI ( blue ) and observed for GFP - H2B ( green ) and RanGAP1 - RFP ( red ) . Note that RFP and RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP do not show any specific signal on spindle or kinetochores .

Note that cells expressing RanGAP1 - RFP show distinct dots of RanGAP1 near the positive ends of microtubules , but these foci are absent in RanGAP1 - RFP - K524R – transfected cells . on J u l y 9 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 600 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 4 , 2002 Notably , RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP was also strikingly ab - sent from spindles and kinetochores in digitonin - permeabi - lized mitotic cells containing GFP - histone H2B ( n (cid:5) 50 ) ( Fig . 4 C ) . It is unlikely that this absence reflects poor ex - pression or instability of RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP , since 100 % of the cells with the GFP - histone H2B cotransfection marker showed strong RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP fluorescence when examined without digitonin permeabilization ( unpub - lished data ) . Furthermore , the overall expression of mutant and wild - type RanGAP1 - RFP appeared similar when fixa - tion was performed without prior permeabilization ( Fig . 4 D ) . Staining of mitotic cells expressing either RanGAP1 - RFP or RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP with antitubulin antibodies showed that these proteins did not disrupt spindle formation ( Fig . 4 D ) . Thus , the failure of the mutant RanGAP1 to bind to spindles and kinetochores is most likely due to its in - ability to undergo SUMO - 1 conjugation rather than some indirect effect on spindle structure . Remarkably , we ob - served that we could detect some elevation in the RanGAP1 - RFP levels at kinetochores even in cells that had not been digitonin permeabilized ( Fig . 4 D ) , although the distribu - tion of RanGAP1 - RFP on the remainder of the spindle was difficult to discern because of the high background from sol - uble RanGAP1 - RFP . This enrichment was entirely absent in the cells expressing RanGAP1 - K524R - RFP . Together , these observations strongly suggest that SUMO - 1 conjugation is not only essential for targeting RanGAP1 to nuclear pores , but also is required for RanGAP’s association with mitotic spindles and kinetochores . Our findings suggest that a major role of SUMO - 1 conju - gation to RanGAP1 may be the spatial regulation of the Ran pathway during open mitosis . Although Ran plays a role in spindle assembly in fission yeast ( Fleig et al . , 2000 ) , there is no general dissipation of the Ran - GTP gradient at mitosis in budding or fission yeast because they undergo a closed mito - sis during which the nuclear envelope does not break down ( for review see Sazer and Dasso , 2000 ) . Moreover , Ran does not relocalize to the cytoplasm at any point in the yeast cell cycle , nor does a substantial fraction of RanGAP1 enter the nucleus . It is thus difficult to imagine how a gradient of Ran - GTP might be established in yeast nuclei where spindle formation occurs . It appears likely that there will be funda - mental differences between yeast and metazoans in the way Ran functions during mitosis ( Sazer and Dasso , 2000 ) . The restriction of SUMO - 1 conjugation of RanGAP1 to meta - zoans may therefore reflect its particular role in the localiza - tion of RanGAP1 during spindle assembly in the absence of an intact nuclear envelope . RanBP2 colocalizes with RanGAP1 throughout the cell cycle In Xenopus egg extracts , RanGAP1 – SUMO - 1 remains asso - ciated with RanBP2 in mitosis ( unpublished data ) , raising the question of whether RanBP2 might also be targeted to the spindle . To evaluate this possibility , we performed im - munofluorescent staining of digitonin - permeabilized cells with antibodies against RanGAP1 and RanBP2 ( Fig . 5 ) . As above , the cells were also stained with the DNA dye DAPI . We found that RanBP2 associated with mitotic spindles in a pattern that extensively overlapped with the staining of RanGAP1 . This colocalization was particularly evident at the kinetochores . Notably , however , RanBP2 staining ex - tended beyond RanGAP1 staining to regions near spin - dle poles that contained (cid:3) - tubulin ( Fig . 2 B ) . As with RanGAP1 , RanBP2 staining was abolished by prior treat - ment of the mitotic cells with nocodazole ( unpublished data ) . Performance of this experiment with two indepen - dently generated antibodies against RanBP2 ( Yokoyama et al . , 1995 ; Saitoh et al . , 1997 ) gave essentially identical re - sults . Our observations indicate that RanBP2 is targeted to the same sites on mitotic spindles as RanGAP1 , as well as to additional distinct sites . Given that RanGAP1 and RanBP2 form a tight complex throughout the cell cycle in Xenopus egg extracts ( Saitoh et al . , 1997 ; unpublished data ) , the simplest interpretation of these results would be that these proteins associate with MTs and kinetochores as a complex . Consistent with this notion , we observed that a short COOH - terminal region of human RanGAP1 ( amino acids 401 – 587 ) , which corresponds to the region in mouse RanGAP1 that is sufficient for SUMO - 1 conjugation and RanBP2 association in interphase ( Ma - tunis et al . , 1998 ) , could associate with spindle and kineto - chores in mitosis ( unpublished data ) . The RanGAP1 – RanBP2 complex may be less stable near spindle poles , such that RanGAP1 is released from the MTs in this region while RanBP2 remains associated . This model for RanGAP1 asso - ciation with the spindle makes two predictions : first , the dis - sociation of the RanGAP1 from RanBP2 occurs in response Figure 5 . RanBP2 colocalizes with RanGAP1 in mitosis . HeLa cells were stained with DAPI ( blue ) , anti - RanBP2 ( green ) , and anti - RanGAP1 ( red ) . Note the strong staining of spindle poles by anti - RanBP2 antibodies but not by anti - RanGAP1 . on J u l y 9 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m SUMO - 1 targets RanGAP1 to the mitotic spindle | Joseph et al . 601 to some factor ( s ) localized near spindle poles . One attractive possibility would be that this complex becomes destabilized through loss of SUMO - 1 conjugation to RanGAP1 . Sec - ond , RanBP2 can bind to sites on the spindle in a manner that is independent of RanGAP1 . It is possible that RanBP2 could associate with MTs directly or that it is targeted to MTs through binding to other spindle - associated proteins . Several pore - associated proteins have recently been re - ported to associate with mitotic spindles , including hNup133 , hNup107 ( Belgareh et al . , 2001 ) , PBC68 ( The - odoropoulos et al . , 1999 ) , and Rae1 ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) . Conversely , the hMad1 and hMad2 proteins , which play es - sential roles in the spindle assembly checkpoint localize to the nuclear pore during interphase ( Campbell et al . , 2001 ) . Together with our findings , these observations suggest a re - lationship between the nuclear pore and the spindle . Al - though the nature of this relationship remains to be demon - strated , it is attractive to speculate that an essential requirement for the same set of proteins in both interphase pores and mitotic spindles could enforce a reciprocal rela - tionship between these two structures ( i . e . , the assembly of one structure would be mutually exclusive with the persis - tence of the other ) , and thereby structurally differentiate the interphase state from mitosis . In summary , we have shown that RanGAP1 is targeted to kinetochores and mitotic spindles . This targeting is achieved through SUMO - 1 conjugation , and may involve interac - tions with RanBP2 . Our observations suggest that Ran - GTP gradients may be regulated in a complex fashion during mi - tosis , and that SUMO - 1 modification of RanGAP1 may be used in metazoans extensively for this purpose .
