Here , we show that JARID1B , encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4 ) demethylase , is frequently ampliﬁed and overexpressed in luminal breast tumors and a somatic mutation in a basal - like breast cancer results in the gain of unique chromatin binding and luminal expression and splicing patterns . Downregulation of JARID1B in luminal cells induces basal genes expression and growth arrest , which is rescued by TGF b pathway inhibitors . Integrated JARID1B chromatin binding , H3K4 methylation , and expres - sion proﬁles suggest a key function for JARID1B in luminal cell - speciﬁc expression programs . High luminal JARID1B activity is associated with poor outcome in patients with hormone receptor - positive breast tumors . Signiﬁcance Transcriptional regulators are recurrently mutated in breast cancer , highlighting the importance of perturbed epigenetic programs in tumorigenesis . Here , we show that JARID1B is commonly mutated in breast tumors and that it modulates luminal and basal cell - speciﬁc expression programs . A heterozygous JARID1B mutation in basal - like cells leads to gain of binding to luminal genes . JARID1B binding overlaps with CTCF , and the two proteins form a potentially functionally rele - vant complex as H3K4me3 signal is lower at JARID1B - CTCF - overlapping , compared to nonoverlapping , sites . Our data suggest that JARID1B is a luminal lineage - driving oncogene that may represent a target in luminal breast tumors . However , the complexity of JARID1B’s functions suggests that its therapeutic targeting may require a more intricate approach than inhibition of enzymatic activity . 762 Cancer Cell 25 , 762 – 777 , June 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . INTRODUCTION Histone lysine methylation is important for chromatin organiza - tion and the regulation of gene expression ( Dawson and Kouzar - ides , 2012 ) . Systemic sequencing of human cancer genomes identiﬁed numerous alterations in genes encoding histone - modi - fying enzymes , including somatic mutations of KDM6A , KDM5C , and KDM5B ( also called JARID1B , PLU - 1 ) , in multiple cancer types ( You and Jones , 2012 ) . However , the functional and clin - ical relevance of these mutations are still poorly understood . In breast cancer , genes encoding transcriptional regulators ( e . g . , FOXA1 , GATA3 ) are among the most frequently mutated genes , suggesting a key role for perturbed epigenetic programs in tumorigenesis ( Polyak and Metzger Filho , 2012 ) . Several of these genes are mutated in a breast tumor subtype - speciﬁc manner ( TCGA , 2012 ) . Breast tumors are classiﬁed based on the expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and HER2 into ER + , HER2 + , and ER (cid:1) PR (cid:1) HER2 (cid:1) ( triple - negative breast cancer [ TNBC ] ) disease . Based on gene expres - sion proﬁles , breast tumors are characterized as luminal or basal - like ( Perou et al . , 2000 ; Sørlie et al . , 2001 ) . HER2 + and ER + tumors typically have luminal features , whereas TNBCs show signiﬁcant , but not complete , overlap with the basal - like subtype . In general , many more recurrent mutations are present in luminal than in basal - like breast tumors ( Polyak and Metzger Filho , 2012 ) . The high frequency of mutations in GATA3 and FOXA1 transcription factors with essential roles in luminal epithelial differentiation ( Bernardo et al . , 2010 ; Kouros - Mehr et al . , 2006 ) in luminal breast tumors suggests that perturbed differentiation programs are important for tumor development . Increasing evidence indicates that histone methyltransferases ( HMTs ) and demethylases ( HDMs ) play key roles in regulating cellular differentiation states . KDM5B , which encodes the his - tone H3 lysine4 ( H3K4 ) demethylase JARID1B ( Christensen et al . , 2007 ; Iwase et al . , 2007 ; Yamane et al . , 2007 ) , was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a gene whose expression was reversibly regulated by HER2 signaling in breast cancer cells ( Lu et al . , 1999 ) . Over - expression of JARID1B in HeLa cells results in loss of tri - , di - , and monomethyl H3K4 but does not affect H3K9 , H3K27 , or H3K36 methylation . JARID1B is overexpressed in prostate carcinomas , where it associates with the androgen receptor and regulates its tran - scriptional activity ( Xiang et al . , 2007 ) . Overexpression and tumor growth - promoting effects of JARID1B have also been described in bladder and lung cancers ( Hayami et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , the expression of JARID1B is downregulated in melanoma , where it has been implicated as a tumor suppressor inhibiting cell prolif - eration in an RB - dependent manner ( Roesch et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) . However , JARID1B also plays a role in melanoma tumor mainte - nance and in metastatic progression based on xenotransplant assays in immunodeﬁcient mice ( Roesch et al . , 2010 ) . JARID1B regulates the proliferation and differentiation of em - bryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) ( Dey et al . , 2008 ; Frankenberg et al . , 2007 ; Kidder et al . , 2013 ; Schmitz et al . , 2011 ; Xie et al . , 2011 ; Yamane et al . , 2007 ; You and Jones , 2012 ) , and it is involved in murine mammary gland development ( Catchpole et al . , 2011 ) . JARID1B overexpression in ESCs decreases the expres - sion of differentiated cell - speciﬁc genes and increases prolif - eration ( Dey et al . , 2008 ) . The targeting of key transcriptional regulators of progenitor cell function may also play a role in JARID1B’s tumor - promoting effects , a hypothesis that has not been tested experimentally . Despite the importance of JARID1B in normal development and in tumorigenesis , its mechanism of action is still poorly deﬁned . RESULTS JARID1B Is Ampliﬁed and Overexpressed in Breast Tumors We identiﬁed JARID1B as a gene with common copy number gain based on our single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array analysis of breast tumors and cancer cell lines ( Nikolsky et al . , 2008 ) , which we also conﬁrmed by quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) and ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) ( Figure 1A ; Figure S1A available online ; data not shown ) . Analysis of the METABRIC data set ( Curtis et al . , 2012 ) showed that JARID1B copy number gain is associated with increased transcript levels ( Figure 1B ) , especially in luminal subtypes ( compare Figures 1C and S1B ) . JARID1B mRNA levels are also the highest in luminal A and HER2 + tumors both when using the PAM50 ( Parker et al . , 2009 ) and the IC10 ( Curtis et al . , 2012 ) classiﬁcation ( Figures 1D and 1E ) and somewhat higher in ER + than in ER (cid:1) cases ( Fig - ure S1C ) . JARID1B protein levels displayed a similar trend in breast cancer cell lines ( Figure S1D ) . Loss of JARID1B Inhibits Breast Cancer Cell Growth To investigate the functional relevance of JARID1B overexpres - sion in breast cancer , ﬁrst we performed a lentiviral small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) screen for cellular viability in a panel of luminal and basal - like breast cancer cell lines . In both the primary and secondary screens , shRNAs against JARID1B had the most pro - nounced growth inhibitory effect in ER + luminal breast cancer cells ( MCF7 and T - 47D ) based on the signiﬁcance of decrease in viable cells ( i . e . , Z score in the primary and percent decrease of viability in the secondary screen ) and the number of indepen - dent shRNA clones that were hits in these assays ( Figures 1F , S1E , and S1F ) . Similar results were obtained using JARID1B - targeting small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) ( Figures S1G – S1I ) , and the decrease in cell viability was rescued by the exogenous expression of siRNA - resistant JARID1B cDNAs ( Figures S1J and S1K ) . We did not detect signiﬁcant apoptosis in any of the cell lines after siJARID1B transfection , consistent with prior reports ( Yamane et al . , 2007 ) . The downregulation of JARID1B did not affect the protein levels of the closely related JARID1A , and it only slightly increased global histone H3K4me3 levels in the MCF7 and T - 47D luminal breast cancer cell lines with no obvious change in H3K4me1 / 2 or H3K27me3 ( Figures S1L and S1M ) . These results support the hypothesis that JARID1B is a target of the 1q32 amplicon and suggested that JARID1B function might particularly be important in ER + luminal breast cancer cells . Loss of JARID1B - Induced Gene Expression Changes To further explore JARID1B function , we performed RNA - seq of luminal and basal - like breast cancer cell lines transfected with control or JARID1B - targeting siRNAs and identiﬁed genes with signiﬁcant expression changes . Basal - like and luminal breast cancer cell lines clustered together based on RNA - seq proﬁles Cancer Cell JARID1B and Luminal Genes in Breast Cancer Cancer Cell 25 , 762 – 777 , June 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 763 with the exception of the JARID1B mutant HCC2157 basal - like line that clustered with luminal lines ( Figure 2A ) . The cell lines showed variable number of genes with signiﬁcantly altered expression after siJARID1B transfection ( Figures S2A and S2B ) ; thus , we selected the top 200 differentially expressed genes in each cell line for comparison ( Table S1 ) .

In luminal cells , more genes were up than downregulated following siJARID1B transfection , whereas the opposite was observed in basal - like cells ( Figure S2B ) . The dif - ferences in expression levels were also conﬁrmed by quantita - tive RT - PCR for selected genes in MCF7 cells ( Figure 2C ) . TGF b Signaling in JARID1B Loss - Mediated Growth Arrest To explore the functional relevance of gene expression changes following downregulation of JARID1B , we performed network and pathway analyses of the top 200 differentially expressed genes using the Metacore suit ( Bessarabova et al . , 2011 ) . This approach identiﬁed a prominent upregulation of basal / stem cell genes in siJARID1B - transfected luminal cells ( Figures 2D , 2E , and S2C ) and signiﬁcant enrichment for the TGF b signaling pathway ( Figure S2D ) . Correlating with this , the top 200 differ - entially expressed genes in siJARID1B - transfected MCF7 cells showed distinct patterns of expression in luminal and basal - like primary breast tumors ( Figures 2E and S2C ) , with the up genes in general having higher expression in basal - like tumors , demonstrating the physiologic relevance of these gene signa - tures in patient samples . Interestingly , in basal - like cells enrich - ment for the TGF b signaling pathway was observed for the genes downregulated after siJARID1B transfection ( Figure S2D ) , again suggesting luminal - basal differences in JARID1B’s function . To further investigate the role of TGF b signaling in JARID1B loss - mediated growth arrest , we ﬁrst analyzed phosphoSMAD2 , a key downstream target of TGF b receptor kinases , and found increased levels in siJARID1B - transfected MCF7 cells ( Fig - ure S2E ) . To determine whether the activation of TGF b signaling is required for JARID1B loss - mediated growth arrest , we down - regulated key components of the TGF b pathway ( i . e . , SMAD4 and TGFBR2 ) by siRNAs ( Figure S2F ) or inhibited TGF b receptor kinase activity using a small molecule inhibitor ( SMI ) . Treatment of MCF7 and T - 47D luminal breast cancer cells with a trans - forming growth factor - beta receptor ( TGFBR ) kinase inhibitor ( LY2109761 ) rescued the siJARID1B - induced growth arrest in a dose - dependent manner , whereas no effect was seen in SUM159PT basal - like cells ( Figure 2F ; data not shown ) . Downre - gulation of SMAD4 or TGFBR2 by siRNAs had similar effects ( Figure 2G ; data not shown ) . These results suggest that JARID1B expression in luminal breast cancer cells is required for the repression of basal cell - speciﬁc genes , including those impor - tant for TGF b signaling , and the loss of this repression following decreased JARID1B leads to growth arrest . In contrast , in basal - like breast cancer cells , JARID1B loss leads to decreased TGF b pathway activity , but this may not play a role in JARID1B loss - mediated growth arrest in this cell type . Genomic Targets of JARID1B To identify the genomic targets of JARID1B , we performed chro - matin immunoprecipitation sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) in luminal and basal - like breast cancer cells . ChIP was optimized and the speciﬁcity of the JARID1B antibody was validated by ChIP - qPCR , which showed signiﬁcant decrease in signal at known JARID1B - binding regions in siJARID1B - expressing MCF7 cells ( FiguresS3A – S3C ) . ThenumberofJARID1Bpeaksvariedamong cell lines ; thus , we used the top 10 , 000 peaks in each cell line for comparisons among samples . Clustering of the samples based on JARID1B peaks showed luminal and basal patterns ( Fig - ure 3A ) . Interestingly , the JARID1B mutant HCC2157 basal - like cell line showed higher relatedness to luminal cells and had numerous unique peaks . The number and distribution of JARID1B peaks relative to transcription start site ( TSS ) varied among cell lines with luminal cells in general having more pro - moter and basal - like cells having more nonpromoter peaks ( Fig - ure 3B ) , and intriguingly > 90 % of the (cid:3) 9 , 891 HCC2157 unique peaks were located in nonpromoter regions ( Table S2 ) . Clus - tering of the samples using promoter and nonpromoter peaks demonstrated that luminal - basal differences in JARID1B binding are more signiﬁcant at nonpromoter regions and again high - lighted the uniqueness of HCC2157 cells ( Figure 3C ) . JARID1B Binding Pattern Overlaps with H3K4me3 and Active Genes JARID1BisahistoneH3K4demethylaseandbasedoninvitroas - says it can demethylate all three H3K4 methylated forms ( i . e . , mono - , di - , and trimethyl ) albeit with varying efﬁciency and with the highest afﬁnity for H3K4me3 ( Christensen et al . , 2007 ; Iwase etal . , 2007 ; Kristensenetal . , 2012 ; Yamaneetal . , 2007 ) . Thus , we investigatedwhetherJARID1Bchromatinbindingandchangesin JARID1B levels inﬂuence H3K4 methylation patterns in breast cancer cells . Correlating with its HDM function , we detected increased H3K4me3 / me2 signal ratios following downregula - tion of JARID1B in MCF7 cells ( Figure 3D ) . However , despite its H3K4me3 / 2 HDM activity , we found that JARID1B binding Figure 3 .

Cancer Cell JARID1B and Luminal Genes in Breast Cancer Cancer Cell 25 , 762 – 777 , June 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 767 overlapped with high H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 signal in both luminal and basal - like breast cancer cells ( Figures 3E and S3D ) , potentially because of the high afﬁnity of its PHD domains to H3K4me3 as reported for JARID1A ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . We vali - dated increased H3K4me3 / me2 levels after siJARID1B expres - sion for several genes with clearly overlapping JARID1B and H3K4me3 / me2 peaks in their promoter region and increased expression in siJARID1B - transfected MCF7 cells ( Figures 3F and 3G ; Figures S3B and S3C ) . Interestingly , the increase in H3K4me3 signal in siJARID1B - transfected cells was abrogated by treatment with a TGFBR kinase inhibitor ( Figure 3G ) . H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 mark transcriptionally active genes ( Ram et al . , 2011 ; Zhang and Pugh , 2011 ) . In line with this , genes with JARID1B promoter binding were highly expressed in all cell lines analyzed ( Figure 3H ) . These data suggest that JARID1B chromatin binding by itself may not be sufﬁcient for HDM func - tion or that JARID1B is ﬁne - tuning the levels of genes already destined to be expressed in the cells . To further explore these associations , we analyzed JARID1B binding and H3K4me3 / me2 - enrichment patterns of genes up - or downregulated in siJARID1B - transfected MCF7 cells . We found that the pro - moter region of the differentially expressed genes was signiﬁ - cantly enriched for JARID1B binding and also for H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 ( Figure 4A ) , indicating a clear and strong associ - ation between JARID1B promoter binding and downstream gene expression changes in siJARID1B - transfected cells . To investigate the sequence - speciﬁcity of JARID1B binding , we performed motif analysis of JARID1B binding sites and iden - tiﬁed highly CG - rich sequences ( Figures 4B and S4A ) , conﬁrming the results of in vitro binding assays ( Scibetta et al . , 2007 ) . The presence of CpG nucleotides in these consensus motifs raised the possibility that JARID1B binding might be inﬂuenced by DNA methylation . To explore this , we analyzed potential associ - ations between DNA methylation and JARID1B targets ( see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details ) . Baseline DNA methylation was higher in genes that were upregulated in siJARID - transfected luminal MCF7 and T - 47D cells , whereas the opposite was observed in some basal - like cells ( Figure 4C ) . However , these differences might simply reﬂect the association of JARID1B with H3K4m3 / me2 - enriched regions as unmethy - lated H3K4 has been linked to de novo DNA methylation ( Ooi et al . , 2007 ) . Correlating with this , JARID1B - binding sites had lower levels of DNA methylation than did other regions analyzed , and this was also associated with differences in H3K4me3 enrichment ( Figures S4B and S4C ) . Thus , DNA methylation might inﬂuence JARID1B binding and its effect on gene expression , but delineating these relationships will require further studies . JARID1B Binding Is Enriched in Luminal - High Genes To further investigate JARID1B chromatin binding patterns , we analyzed associations between JARID1B binding and genes differentially expressed between luminal and basal - like breast cancer cells . Despite its overall binding to actively transcribed genes in all cell types , JARID1B showed signiﬁcant enrichment in the promoter and enhancer regions of luminal - high genes in luminal cells with a much less pronounced pattern observed for basal - high genes in basal cells ( Figure 4D ) . These results imply potential cooperation between JARID1B and luminal line - age - speciﬁc transcription factors ( TFs ) . We investigated this by integrating ChIP - seq data for such TFs in breast cancer cells with our results . We found that luminal - high genes in luminal cells were enriched for genomic targets of ER , GATA3 , FOXA1 , and TFAP2C transcription factors with known roles in luminal differ - entiation ( Kouros - Mehr et al . , 2008 ; Siegel and Muller , 2010 ) ( Fig - ure 4D ) . We also found a signiﬁcant overlap between JARID1B promoter binding genes and genes differentially expressed 3 hr after estradiol treatment in MCF7 cells ( Figure S4D ) . How - ever , because JARID1B peaks are enriched in highly expressed genes in luminal cells and ER is a key transcriptional activator in MCF7 cells , seeing a signiﬁcant overlap is not unexpected . Thus , this observation by itself does not prove a functionally relevant link between JARID1B and ER targets . In contrast , promoters and enhancers of basal - high genes with JARID1B binding did not show enrichment for any TFs with available ChIP - seq data ( data not shown ) . Thus , the com - bined activation of luminal - speciﬁc and repression of basal - spe - ciﬁc genes might be required for the establishment of luminal cell - speciﬁc gene expression programs and associated pheno - types , whereas basal - speciﬁc patterns might represent default states or regulated by not - yet characterized TFs . Clinical Relevance of JARID1B Activity in Breast Cancer To investigate the clinical relevance of JARID1B copy number gain and overexpression in breast cancer , we analyzed molecu - lar data from 1 , 980 breast carcinomas ( the METABRIC cohort ) ( Curtis et al . , 2012 ) . JARID1B expression level varied with respect to PAM50 subtype and the ten integrative clusters ( Fig - ures 1D and 1E ) . To explore the activity of JARID1B in a more comprehensive manner , we used PARADIGM ( Vaske et al . , 2010 ) to create signatures mirroring JARID1B activity in MCF7 and SUM159PT cell lines based on gene expression , copy - number , and JARID1B ChIP - seq data ( MCF7 and SUM159PT - index ) . The two JARID1B activity indexes were calculated for each METABRIC sample by extracting gene expression and copy number features included in the signature . For each index , samples were split into three groups ; negative , zero , or positive JARID1B activity , with distinct clinicopathological features ( Table S3 ) . The three JARID1B MCF7 - index groups showed different outcomes in which patients with ER + tumors and a pos - itive JARID1B activity score had a shorter disease - speciﬁc sur - vival than did patients with ER + tumors and negative JARID1B activity ( Figure 5A ) . Positive JARID1B activity had a hazard ratio of 1 . 9 ( 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 3 . 3 , p = 0 . 029 ) in ER + tumors compared to negative activity after correcting for known prognostic covari - ates in a Cox regression model ( Table S4 ) . The differences in survival depending on JARID1B activity remained signiﬁcant in ER + tumors treated with endocrine therapy alone ( Figure 5A ) . The JARID1B SUM159PT - index also showed a signiﬁcant difference in survival for patients with ER + tumors , but here zero activity indicated worse prognosis ( Figure 5B ) . These data again highlight that JARID1B activity is distinct between luminal and basal breast cancer cells and that positive luminal JARID1B activity is associated with worse outcomes in luminal ER + tumors , implying oncogenic function .

DNA binding site motif analysis on JARID1B ChIP - seq peaks and identiﬁed CTCF as the top scoring factor ( Z score (cid:1) 81 . 1077 , (cid:1) 10 * log ( pval ) : 690 . 7755279 ) , both in luminal and basal breast cancer cells ( Table S5 ) . We veriﬁed overlap with CTCF by ChIP - seq in both cell lines ( Figures 6A and 6B ) using ENCODE data for MCF7 ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) and our data in SUM159PT cells . Overall , a relatively higher fraction of JARID1B overlaps with CTCF in SUM159PT compared to MCF7 cells , both in promoter Figure 4 .

However , in MCF7 cells the ratio of overlapping sites was much smaller in promoter compared to nonpromoter regions , whereas no such difference was detected in SUM159PT cells . Because the binding of CTCF is inhibited by DNA methylation ( Shukla et al . , 2011 ) , we analyzed the level of DNA methylation of CTCF binding sites in relation to transcription start site ( TSS ) and JARID1B binding . CTCF binding sites had low level of DNA methylation , which was even lower at CTCF - JARID1B overlapping sites ( Figure S5A ) . These differ - ences were signiﬁcant in both MCF7 and SUM159 cells but were more pronounced at nonpromoters in MCF7 cells . To determine if the overlap of JARID1B and CTCF binding sites may indicate that the two proteins are present in the same com - plex , we performed JARID1B immunoprecipitation followed by CTCF immunoblot in a panel of breast cancer cell lines . We de - tected variable levels of CTCF protein in JARID1B immunopre - cipitates in all cell lines tested , except in SUM185PE , suggesting that the two proteins may interact in most breast cancer cells ( Figure 6D ) . To explore potential associations between JARID1B - CTCF and H3K4 methylation status , we analyzed H3K4me3 signal in relation to JARID1B - CTCF overlap . The level H3K4me3 signal at sites of JARID1B - CTCF overlap was signiﬁcantly lower in MCF7 luminal cells ( Figure S5B ) , and this was most pronounced in promoters ( Figure 6E ) . In line with this , we detected signiﬁ - cantly ( p value < 2 . 2 (cid:1) 16 , Wilcoxon test ) stronger JARID1B and weaker CTCF signal at promoters in MCF7 luminal cells compared to the SUM159PT basal - like cells ( Figure 6F ) . The nonoverlapping sites had higher H3K4me3 signal in MCF7 cells , whereas in SUM159PT cells even these sites showed somewhat lower values , implying that the JARID1B - CTCF inter - action may have a more pronounced effect in luminal compared to basal breast cancer cells . These observations are intriguing in light of recurrent CTCF mutations in ER + breast cancer ( Ellis et al . , 2012 ; TCGA 2012 ) , implying a subtype - speciﬁc role in tumorigenesis . CTCF is known to have many different biological functions and can have opposing effects on gene expression depending on the location of its binding site relative to TSS ( Filippova , 2008 ; Fior - entino and Giordano , 2012 ) . Thus , to further explore the potential relevance of CTCF - JARID1B interaction in luminal breast cancer cells , we analyzed JARID1B chromatin binding and gene expres - sion patterns in MCF7 cells following transfection with siCTCF . JARID1B peak signal signiﬁcantly decreased in siCTCF - trans - fected cells ( Figure 6G ) , and this decrease was more signiﬁcant ( p value < 2 . 2 (cid:1) 16 Wilcox test ) in the JARID1B - CTCF overlapping versus nonoverlapping sites in the promoter regions , whereas the opposite was observed in nonpromoters ( Figure S5C ) . Coin - cidentally , with a decrease in CTCF and JARID1B promoter bind - ing , we observed an increase in global H3K4me3 levels in MCF7 cells ( Figure S5D ) . In contrast , in SUM185PT cells that were negative for JARID1B - CTCF complexes by immunoprecipita - tion , H3K4me3 decreased after siCTCF ( Figure S5D ) , and this was accompanied by increased JARID1B chromatin binding in Figure 5 .

These results imply that CTCF may modulate JARID1B’s chromatin binding function and HDM activity . However , many of these associations might be due to global chromatin changes induced by decreased CTCF levels and may not reﬂect the functional relevance of CTCF - JARID1B interaction ; dissecting the underly - ing mechanisms requires further studies . JARID1B Mutant with Luminal Gain of Function Lastly , we investigated the potential functional relevance of the K1435R JARID1B heterozygous missense mutation in the HCC2157 basal - like breast cancer cell line ( Figure 7A ) . Gene expression and JARID1B ChIP - seq data revealed patterns unique to HCC2157 cells that made it more similar to luminal cells ( Figures 2A and 3A ) , although this cell line is ER (cid:1) PR (cid:1) HER2 (cid:1) and classiﬁed as a basal - like breast cancer . Indeed , many of the genes associated with HCC2157 - unique JARID1B peaks showed high expression in luminal breast tumors and cell lines ( Figures 7B and 7C ) . The SPDEF transcription factor with known luminal functions was among the HCC2157 - unique JARID1B peaks , and both SPEDF and its targets showed elevated levels in HCC2157 cells ( Table S2 ) . These data imply a gain of JARID1B binding to luminal - speciﬁc genes leading to their increased expression in this basal - like breast cancer cell line potentially due to the JARID1B mutation . To test this experimentally , we exogenously expressed Myc epitope - tagged wild - type ( WT ) and mutant JARID1B in SUM159PT basal breast cancer cells and assessed JARID1B binding and gene expression patterns . We found that the K1435R mutant displayed greater enrichment for HCC2157 - unique JARID1B peaks ( Figure 7D ) , and this was accompanied with modest differences in the expression of some genes nearest to these peaks ( Figure S6A ) . The relatively modest effects on gene expression are not surprising because the exogenous transfection and overexpression of WT and mutant JARID1B in SUM159PT basal cells may not fully repro - duce the physiologic differences in their function ; protein levels might be higher than that of endogenous and some transcription factors required for the expression of luminal genes may be lack - ing in SUM159PT cells . Thus , precise understanding of mutant JARID1B function in HCC2157 cells would require the analysis of cells following the selective deletion of mutant or wild - type JARID1B alleles . Intriguingly , ESRP1 , encoding a key regulator of luminal splicing patterns ( Warzecha and Carstens , 2012 ) , was one of the genes more signiﬁcantly enriched for mutant than wild - type JARID1B and its expression increased the most signiﬁcantly after mutant JARID1B transfection in SUM159PT cells ( Fig - ure S6A ) . ESRP1 is also one of the most signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes between luminal and basal breast cancer cells , and the differences in its endogenous levels between HCC2157 and other basal - like cell lines were the largest among all genes analyzed ( Figure S6A ) . These observations led us to explore the splicing patterns of genes with known luminal - basal cell - speciﬁc variants , such as ENAH and CD44 ( Shapiro et al . , 2011 ) , in our RNA - seq data . We found that the HCC2157 basal cell line expressed the luminal splice variants of all of these genes ( Figure S6B ) , potentially because of high ESRP1 levels induced by mutant JARID1B . Correlating with this , transfection of mutant JARID1B in SUM159PT cells increased the expression of luminal splice variants for several genes ( Figure S6C ) , further supporting the functional relevance of mutant JARID1B in HCC2157 cells . Interestingly , HCC2157 - unique JARID1B peaks did not over - lap with CTCF in contrast to all JARID1B peaks detected in these cells ( Figure 7E ) , implying the lack of co - occurrence of the two factors at the unique sites . We experimentally tested this hypoth - esis by performing immunoprecipitation for Myc - tagged wild - type or mutant JARID1B followed by CTCF western . Lower levels of CTCF were detected in mutant JARID1B immunoprecipitates , potentially implying that mutant JARID1B and CTCF may not be found in the same protein complexes ( Figure 7F ) . These results further support the functional relevance of CTCF - JARID1B interaction and imply that somatic mutations in JARID1B ( or potentially also inCTCF ) mayalter thecomposition of these com - plexes , leading to altered JARID1B function . To explore this , we investigated H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 signal in HCC2157 cells at common and HCC2157 - unique JARID1B peaks in promoter and nonpromoterareas , assumingthatallormostofuniquebindingis due to the mutant protein . Unique JARID1B promoter peaks had much lower H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 signal compared to the common ones , whereas nonpromoters had about the same low signal for both unique and common sites ( Figure 7G ) . Although there could be many potential explanations for these differences , these data suggest that mutant JARID1B - containing complexes may have increased HDM activity . DISCUSSION Perturbations of cell type - speciﬁc transcriptional programs play key roles in tumorigenesis , in particular , in breast cancer a signif - icant fraction of recurrently mutated genes encode for transcrip - tion factors or epigenetic regulators ( Polyak and Metzger Filho , 2012 ) . Although therapeutic targeting of aberrant transcriptional programs has been challenging , the identiﬁcation of BET bromo - domain inhibitors as regulators of the MYC oncogene ( Delmore et al . , 2011 ; Filippakopoulos et al . , 2010 ) have reignited interest in this area . Developing speciﬁc inhibitors of chromatin regula - tors is one of the most active areas of current drug discovery ef - forts . However , the validation and application of these inhibitors require the precise understanding of the biochemical and tumor - igenic function of these epigenetic regulators . Here , we describe a role of JARID1B in breast cancer and reveal that its chromatin binding and HDM activity might be modulated by associated proteins , such as CTCF . Thus , its potential therapeutic targeting might require a more sophisticated approach than simple inhibi - tion of enzymatic activity . Our ﬁnding of a nearly complete overlap between JARID1B binding and H3K4me3 mark seems paradoxical as JARID1B is a H3K4me3 demethylase . However , similar observations have been made in two unrelated cell types : human leukemia ( Ram et al . , 2011 ) and mouse ESCs ( Schmitz et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , it ap - pears to be a general phenomenon , and it may reﬂect enzyme - substrate colocalization as reported for JARID1A ( Lopez - Bigas et al . , 2008 ) . Correlating with the preferential binding of JARID1B to promoters enriched for H3K4me3 and active genes , down - regulation of JARID1B had only modest effects on global H3K4me3 and transcript levels , especially in luminal breast can - cer cells . Thus , it appears that JARID1B is not a strong Cancer Cell JARID1B and Luminal Genes in Breast Cancer Cancer Cell 25 , 762 – 777 , June 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 771 ( legend on next page ) Cancer Cell JARID1B and Luminal Genes in Breast Cancer 772 Cancer Cell 25 , 762 – 777 , June 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . transcriptional repressor , but rather it ﬁne - tunes cell type - spe - ciﬁc histone H3K4 methylation and transcript levels . Despite the association of JARID1B binding with actively transcribed genes , both in luminal and basal - like breast cancer cells , the promoters and enhancers of luminal - high genes were signiﬁcantly enriched for JARID1B binding , whereas no such enrichment is seen for basal - high genes . Thus , despite the fact that JARID1B binding is associated with active genes , there is still a signiﬁcant luminal - basal difference . These results are in line with recent observations for other HDMs like KDM4B / C in ESCs ( Das et al . , 2014 ) and also the preferential effects of BET bromodomain inhibitors on BRD4 binding at ‘‘super - enhancers’’ and associated genes ( Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , it appears that many chromatin regulators may have a relatively broad , low - level binding at many sites , implying nonspeciﬁc ac - tion , but a subset of sites with the highest binding signal confer speciﬁcity . We also found a colocalization between JARID1B and CTCF that appears to be speciﬁc for breast cancer cells ( or epithelial cells ) asitwasnotobservedinhematopoieticandEScells . Based on our data , CTCF may modulate JARID1B binding and HDM activity , but neither of these appears to have a pronounced effect on gene transcription due to the complex regulation of Pol II at multiple different levels . Because CTCF with promoter binding pauses Pol II ( Paredes et al . , 2013 ; Shukla et al . , 2011 ) , JARID1B might be recruited to promoters to reduce H3K4me3 level to counteract Pol II accumulation ( Li et al . , 2007 ) . Knock - downofCTCF , althoughreleasesPolIIpausing , dissociatesJAR - ID1B from the chromatin , and creates muted expression changes . The consensus JARID1B binding motif is CG rich , implying potential modulation by DNA methylation . Indeed , we found that JARID1B - bound promoters were less methylated , and pro - moter regions of up and downregulated genes after siJARID1B transfection displayed signiﬁcant differences in DNA methylation levels . CTCF binding is also inhibited by DNA methylation ( Shu - kla et al . , 2011 ) , and JARID1B - CTCF overlapping sites were even less methylated than those with CTCF - only binding . Based on our observations that CTCF may modulate JARID1B’s DNA binding and HDM activity , it is intriguing to speculate that the combinatorial effects of JARID1B - CTCF and regulators of DNA and H3K27 methylation work together to establish luminal epithelial differentiation programs . Correlating with this , CTCF and KDM6A mutations are commonly found in luminal breast cancer cells ( Ciriello et al . , 2013 ; Ellis et al . , 2012 ) . The frequent copy number gain and our ChIP - seq and functional data imply that JARID1B activity may particularly be important in luminal breast tumors that in general have better outcome than does basal - like breast cancer . However , our data also show that high luminal JARID1B activity in ER + tumors may be associated with endocrine resistance . Further - more , the expression of a luminal gain - of - function JARID1B mutant ( e . g . , K1435R JARID1B in HCC2157 cells ) aberrantly activating some luminal genes in basal breast tumors may result in less favorable clinical behavior . Correlating with this , gain of luminal features , such as the increased expression of CD24 , are commonly observed in treatment - resistant distant metastatic lesions ( Shipitsin et al . , 2007 ) and in chemo - therapy - resistant TNBCs ( Almendro et al . , 2014 ) . The JARID1B mutant in HCC2157 cells displayed gain of binding to genomic loci not detected in other cells expressing the WT protein . Mutant JARID1B also appears to be associated with different proteins at these unique sites , and these complexes may have increased HDM activity compared to those with WT JARID1B . Thus , the mutation may perturb both chromatin bind - ing and enzymatic activity . Somatic point mutations in JARID1B have not been commonly observed in breast and other tumor types . However , thus far all large - scale sequencing studies have focused on primary treatment - naive tumors , which may not reveal mutations associated with metastatic progression and therapy resistance . Together , these data imply that JARID1B functions as an oncoprotein in breast cancer by driving a luminal transcriptional program . There can be many reasons why cancer cells with luminal expression patterns may have growth advantage . One possibility is that such cells may be more resistant to therapeutic interventions , as has been described in melanoma ( Roesch et al . , 2010 , 2013 ) . Our data demonstrating enrichment for cancer cells with luminal features in neoadjuvant chemotherapy - resis - tant breast tumors support this hypothesis ( Almendro et al . , 2014 ) . In summary , we describe the detailed molecular characteriza - tion of the JARID1B H3K4 histone demethylase in breast cancer . Our data support a key role for JARID1B in luminal cell - speciﬁc gene expression programs and demonstrate that JARID1B is a luminal lineage - driving oncogene in breast cancer . Furthermore , as ER + breast tumors with high JARID1B activity are associated with worse clinical outcome and resistance to endocrine ther - apy , therapeutic targeting of JARID1B may be a potential treat - ment strategy for this disease .
