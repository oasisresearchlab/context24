They ask about one another’s weekends , families , and children as they wait for their cafeine to kick in . This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4 . 0 License .

I’m not wearing roller skates , ” shouts a staf member as updates are shared . A loud uproar breaks out as several others nod in agreement . Janitorial staf around the room seem to reach a consensus that the “guessing game” of where the recently deployed foor cleaning robots might be and how they might be performing disrupts their daily work . One staf member rolled their eyes exclaiming “ten more minutes , it adds ten more minutes [ to my routine ] ! ” This morning scene illustrates a moment of fellowship and shared commiseration common among janitorial stafers at an air - port in the Rust Belt region of the United States . It is here where we spent the last 20 months studying the rapid deployment of AI technologies in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . Specifcally , we focused our attention on the Airport’s pilot of autonomous foor cleaning robots outftted with ultraviolet ( UV ) light , deployed as a chemical - free means of disinfecting its over half a million , heavily trafcked square feet . After social distancing mandates went into efect in the United States at the beginning of 2020 , the Airport forged a partnership 1 with Northfeld Robotics who provided them with four robots at no cost . In exchange , Northfeld Robotics lever - ages the expansive and diverse terrain of the Airport as a testing site , in order to push early versions of their software or introduce hardware add - ons for refnement before wide release to the market . Through this arrangement , the Airport became one of the frst in the feld of cargo and airplane travel to apply UV technology in the wake of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Though a powerful tool , the UV robots were not able to act on their own , requiring careful cali - bration and coordination on the part of janitorial staf and Airport management . Scholarship within the feld of HCI has long considered the importance of maintenance and repair practices necessary to sus - tain the technical systems upon which workplaces come to rely [ 23 , 29 , 36 ] . Studying copy machine repair , Julian Orr illustrates the social nature of such expertise . Describing the importance of occupational community , he refers to “war stories” told in detail by technicians as a means of establishing social connection and collaborative diagnosis—like the scene that opened this paper . The work of managing and tending to disrepair , that which involves “flling gaps , holes , and cracks , ” requires knowing and seeing the world diferently than the more prominent fgures of the ‘designer’ or ‘user’ [ 23 , 28 , 39 ] . “Repair - thinking” epistemology , as Steve Jack - son refers to it , requires regular adaptation and improvisation as it 1 All organizations and individuals’ names have changed to preserve anonymity . 58 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Esther Kang and Sarah Fox is deeply contingent and reliant on the tools and standards within a particular context [ 23 ] . Building on this critical tradition recognizing the centrality ( and invisibility ) of maintenance , this paper examines the transforma - tion of essential work at the Airport as janitorial staf support the deployment of AI technologies during the pandemic . Drawing on ethnographic observations , interviews , and participatory en - gagements over a nearly two - year period , we extend managerial and engineering descriptions emphasizing the functionality and performance of the autonomous foor cleaning robots . We use re - cuperative approaches to re - center the socio - material realities of workers on - the - ground [ 32 ] who report concerns on the safety of the devices in congested areas and a need for more comprehensive training across all levels of the organization . This research ofers two core contributions to the HCI commu - nity . First , we present this case as a means to elevate the perspectives of essential workers in waste management and their role in man - aging emergent technologies , threading together multiple forms of storytelling to illustrate individual and collective experiences of tech integration within a complex organization . In bringing forth these accounts , we not only seek to celebrate frontline workers’ contributions to technical implementation , but also—in the words of Lucy Suchman—“call into question the grounds on which diferent forms of work are diferentially rewarded , both symbolically and materially” [ 36 ] . Second , we confront ritualistic tendencies in how participatory design is applied by making room for adaptability , re - framing , and customization . In using recuperation as a lens , we position essential workers as experts with the capability to spot - light overlooked problems in systems design and imagine a new set of integration strategies rooted in their knowledge and experience . In bringing forward these contributions , we argue for expanding the discourse on ethical AI by situating essential workers as a key source in developing best practices for deploying new technologies and evaluating pilot projects . In the paper that follows , we begin by ofering an overview of the organizational structure of our feld site , and briefy describe a set of literature that informs our perspective on the invisible work of AI and alternative narratives surrounding innovation . We then describe our methods and turn to a set of vignettes that draw out janitorial perspectives on the deployment of autonomous UV foor cleaning robots at the Airport , contrasting them with more dominant administrative accounts . We end by discussing the ways in which ethnographic and participatory practices can design the conditions for workers to convey the stakes of their labor through deliberate de - centering of the designer and user , and active re - centering of essential workers . 2 BACKGROUND In this section , we contextualize our research on the changing shape of waste labor brought on by the expedited deployment of automated technologies in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . We speak to the history of our site and its organizational structure , including the nature of janitorial work at the Airport , to set the scene for the empirical accounts that follow . Though widespread deinstitutionalization and disinvestment from the region marked the late stages of the last century and led many large airlines to move their hubs elsewhere , the Airport has seen a jump in passengers throughout the 2010s ( largely due to an infux of startups and the growth of the region’s healthcare industry ) . Presently , the Airport is undergoing an expansive ren - ovation to become the frst in its feld , globally , to be completely solar powered through its own microgrid . With this renaissance in recent years , the current CEO cemented revitalization eforts by stating that the long - term aim is to become the “smartest airport in the world . ” In line with this bold vision , the Airport was the frst to deploy UV technology in the wake of the COVID - 19 pandemic through a partnership with Northfeld Robotics . The Airport is managed by the County Authority who makes executive decisions and sets organizational priorities . For instance , daily activity data are sent to the County Authority in addition to Airport administrators . The cleaning staf—the lead manager , shift managers , and janitorial staf—are all employed by an international cleaning and facilities management frm , Building Facilities Man - agement ( BFM ) , who holds a longstanding contract with the Airport . The lead manager is a BFM representative who supervises the work of both shift managers and janitorial staf , and shift managers di - rectly oversee the janitorial workers assigned to their shifts . There are three shifts—day , afternoon , and night ; each with their own set of shift managers and janitorial staf assigned to them . Members of the day shift , for example , arrive around 6am , promptly begin their shift at 6 : 30am , and clock out at 2 : 30pm . During each 8 - hour shift , janitorial workers are expected to complete four rounds of their assigned route , which can difer week - by - week and , at times , day - by - day . With the onset of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the vast majority of janitorial staf were furloughed . Roughly ten remained ( out of the original 79 ) to support the Airport’s operations during the early stages of viral spread , but whole concourses were blocked of to reduce necessary daily cleaning . Those who stayed were the frst to be introduced to the foor scrubbing robots when they were deployed in March 2020 . Though re - hiring has since commenced , the process is staggered , and the Airport has yet to reach pre - pandemic levels in terms of frontline support . According to the janitorial staf in place now , they have each taken on roughly 2 - 3 additional tasks to make up for the work left undone by their missing colleagues and brought on by the introduction of the robots . 3 RELATED WORK In the following section , we outline scholarship that motivates and animates our research . First , we discuss research on the human work undergirding AI , from content moderation that quietly ensures our social media platforms are free of violent imagery to “micro - work” that provides data for algorithms powering the AI - driven technologies that we are now reliant on . We then draw on the notion of everyday design , as well as work that seeks to elevate this activity as inventive . Finally , we discuss research that critically examines the use of counter - narrative strategies to push back on popular depictions of innovation that render eforts of integration and maintenance invisible . 3 . 1 The Invisible Work of AI HCI scholarship has long cast a critical eye on technological change taking place in workplace environments with a focus on how such shifts afect working conditions [ 13 , 34 , 36 ] . While the outcomes 59 Stories from the Frontline : Recuperating Essential Worker Accounts of AI Integration DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia of tech interventions in the workplace may be visible and tangi - ble , the individuals tasked with ensuring that systems function as they should often remain behind the scenes—or carrying out , what Star , Suchman , and other feminist scholars would refer to as , “invisible labor” [ 16 , 34 , 36 ] . Highlighting the integral nature of this work , Suchman argues that the limits or parameters that currently structure working relations are not “discrete phases in some ’system life cycle , ’ but complex , densely structured courses of work without clearly distinguishable boundaries between” [ 35 ] , realized through institutionalized arrangements and practices of confguration , redesign , and maintenance . Though not well under - stood or publicized outside of organizations , Orr speaks to workers’ inclination to disseminate this confgurational knowledge amongst themselves through “war stories , ” where they might circulate ac - counts of how they previously rectifed or addressed unresolved issues — exchanging shared expertise and highlighting the social nature of repair . Over the last decade , the feld’s attention has turned to examining the overlooked labor that sustains AI systems [ 2 , 16 , 21 , 31 ] . Gray and Suri [ 16 ] describe how the push for technological advancement intensifes human labor under the guise of automation . Content moderation on large - scale social media platforms , for example , depends on human processes of tagging , rating , and reviewing violent and ofensive imagery . Yet , the contract workers often doing this labor are cast away in separate facilities and ofered much less impressive pay and benefts than their design and engineering counterparts . Irani refers to this as “hidden layers of human data work” [ 21 ] , accounting for the accumulation of labor from those not properly compensated nor acknowledged [ 37 ] . Wolf similarly argues that , though AI is often referred to as a driver for automation and displacement , integrating such systems in practice requires considerable human efort “to conceive of , train / test , deploy , and ongoingly maintain” [ 41 ] . Researchers have recently taken the lens of invisible work as a design focus to consider how undervalued practices within orga - nizations might be made newly visible [ 22 , 24 , 25 ] . For example , Kow and Cheng [ 27 ] describe the development of an open work review system designed to identify and celebrate hidden human contributions within the context of an air cargo handling company . Others argue for the need to design tools that explicitly support the work of maintainers who are essential to the uptake of a technology within the settings in which they are deployed [ 38 ] . More recent HCI scholarship highlights healthcare workers’ stop - gap eforts to integrate 3D printing technologies into their work practices out of a sense of moral responsibility amid the pandemic , developing local solutions to supply chain failures preventing access to PPE [ 46 ] . These care providers performed the social and technological re - pair work necessary to afect relief eforts via material alternatives and workarounds , as well as adaptation work to ft to local stan - dards and needs [ 47 ] . Such attention upholding an ethos of safety , reliability , and care ( despite extraordinary constraints ) marked es - sential work broadly at the beginning stages of the pandemic , and reignites a need for us as design researchers to focus infrastructure design with a commitment to reduce harm — for , as Lakshmi et al . note , “intermediaries bear the disproportionate cost for infras - tructure creation and maintenance” [ 46 ] . Here , we build on and extend this work to both recognize the inextricable nature of hu - man work required to make AI function and call for new strategies of design and deployment to incorporate the voices of those who do this labor . 3 . 2 Recuperating Everyday Design Practices Attention to mundane and everyday invention highlights the ways in which technological infrastructures are altered and modifed through forms of use [ 5 , 14 , 40 ] . Wakkery and Maestri argue that the domestic household brings forth design sensibilities , with family members modifying their residential spaces so that the technology they acquire can meet their particular needs and al - low them to function under ongoing daily pressures they may face [ 40 ] . This is perceived as creativity performed in the inti - mate context of the home ; however , these eforts are often only comprehended by the individuals creating and living with such designs [ 5 , 10 ] . Recognizing the importance of everyday practices of design outside the home , researchers have used participatory methods to engage community members and other stakeholders toward more appropriate and sustainable solutions [ 4 , 7 , 11 , 12 ] . Com - mon among these methods is collective futuring , moving from incremental adjustments within one’s environment to imagining preferable and lasting outcomes [ 9 , 17 , 19 , 20 ] . Heitlinger et al . [ 19 ] , for example , describe eforts to elicit the realities of urban food growing and construct alternative visions for smart futures in collaboration with grassroots community groups in Newcas - tle upon Tyne . Through the application of participatory methods , the authors contrast the top - down , technocentric visions of smart cities to the priorities of grassroots communities confronted with the consequences of austerity . Similarly , Harrington and Dillahunt [ 17 ] describe the application of design fction to envision a collec - tive future through the lens of youth enrolled in a Chicago - based design summer program . Through attempts to conjure a utopic reality , the youth continue to ground their futuring in present - day social and political forces by articulating design fctions that are , still , heavily laden with dystopian everyday realities of racism and poverty . Each underscore the necessity of participatory methods to unveil preferable and sustainable outcomes while also revealing the need to expand beyond the limitations of dominant speculative practices . Contrasting dominant , linear visions with practice , methods of critical fabulations ofer a lens through which to engage everyday design narratives silenced or forgotten within the wider discourse [ 32 ] . As Rosner describes , strategies of recuperation seek to “revive stories enmeshed within a current design setting but suppressed by prevailing design narratives” [ ibid ] . Attuning to stories unseen and unheard , Rosner calls on design researchers to ask , “what stories are not being told” [ ibid ] . Not simply a matter of recognition , attending to those unacknowledged within the disciplinary parameters of design yet actively contribute to its outcomes allows for opportu - nities to question and reconfgure dominant visions of innovation and bring about responsive action . With our own work , we seek to 60 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Esther Kang and Sarah Fox build upon epistemological intervention by unveiling the realities of essential workers’ circumstances as they carry out the human labor critical to producing and maintaining technological systems — AI technologies deployed in the shadow of the pandemic — as well as put forward recommendations for their organizational futures . 4 METHODOLOGY To bring the daily work of janitorial staf to the fore , we draw upon feminist technoscience perspectives foregrounding the notion that “the perception of any situation is always a matter of an embodied , located subject and their geographically and historically specifc perspective” [ 3 ] . We consider recent critiques on traditional par - ticipatory design ( PD ) methods with focused attention on design workshops as they are currently practiced . HCI scholars argue that despite its founding principle of democratic participation—rooted in the politics of the Scandinavian labor movement— participatory design methods are often carried out as a “privileged , White , youth - ful , and upper to middle - class approach to innovation” that “reveal taken - for - granted expectations , priorities , and ideals” [ 18 ] . For in - stance , Harrington et al . note activities that prompt participants to consider idyllic conditions from which to generate ideas exacerbate social inequities , leading to the development of “infeasible solutions that ultimately frustrate underserved individuals” [ ibid ] . Extend - ing this critique , Rosner et al . call attention to design workshop methods as a “living experiment , ” encouraging an artful approach to their development and execution toward “expanding the reach of its investigative imagination to new formulations of research practice” [ 33 ] . Informed by these perspectives , we center the vantage point of workers within the complex institutional context of the Airport . We turn to HCI scholarship on recuperation , examining whose stories underpin design by elevating the lived experiences that have been suppressed in design settings to inform lines of inquiry [ 32 ] . Our work is also informed by recent calls to reexamine our feld’s reliance on empathetic strategies that tend to be extractive , and position designers as responsible for attuning to the asymmetries that inform design and innovation practice [ 6 ] . From this critical orientation , we developed a set of bespoke pro - cesses that piece facets of existing design research methods such as visual prompts , qualitative interviews , participant observation , and participatory design , while taking into account the circumstances of janitorial staf’s material constraints — namely , the limited time and capacity available due to the increased responsibilities brought about and cemented by the ongoing pandemic and their status as essential workers . In doing so , we address two key questions : 1 ) How is frontline work reshaped by the rapid deployment of AI amid the COVID - 19 pandemic ? and 2 ) How might worker - centered inquiry inform an organization’s protocols and policies around technology deployment ? Our team conducted ethnographic observation at the Airport over the course of 20 months , from June 2020 until February 2022 under IRB approval . When we began feld research we established pandemic - specifc observational protocols , including social distanc - ing , protective equipment , and the keeping of detailed interaction logs should contact tracing be necessary . Our feld visits were guided by an attention to the tasks performed by workers , the “pain points” that emerge through their interactions with technology and the solutions enacted by workers and managers to overcome them . We conducted informal conversations with workers throughout our site visits . During feld visits , we shadowed the lead manager and shift supervisors for 2 - to 4 - hour intervals as they went about their daily duties and managed the ongoing work of supervising janitorial staf and maintaining the newly deployed autonomous foor cleaning robots . Extending our observations , our team conducted qualitative in - terviews with Airport staf ( including administrators , public re - lations personnel , and managerial staf ) , and engineers and feld technicians from Northfeld Robotics . Collectively , these methods helped us develop a robust understanding of the attitudes toward and intentions for the automation of essential work in response to a global public health crisis within the context of the Airport . However , we found that the experiences of janitorial staf who work directly with the UV foor cleaning robots remained absent or partial , sustaining a narrative that centered the vantage point of ad - ministrators and managerial staf and omitting the insights on the socio - material daily realities that encompassed the implementation process . 4 . 1 Participatory Workshops To begin to address these absences , we conducted two partici - patory engagements with sixteen janitorial staf over the span of two days . Each took place during a thirty - minute window as janitorial staf prepared for their early morning shifts , allowing us to have private , concentrated conversations . Through coor - dination with the lead manager , we were ofered a large stor - age room in close proximity to the cleaning staf’s main space yet separate from their break room which was within earshot of the managers’ ofces . We set up the room with a 6 - foot - long fold - out table and chairs and laid out visual prompts for staf to review as they walked in . Each morning , the cadence of the conversation and group formation developed organically making room for individual commentary , group discussion , and airing of grievances . Our visual prompts were inspired by scenes from our feldwork and mimicked the format of storyboards with an unfnished aes - thetic to spark resonance and personal refections on the illustrated phenomenon [ 26 ] . We selected four scenes to represent particu - lar moments in a janitorial staf member’s daily routine refecting their decision - making processes and attitudes , often along points of tension between implicit expectations , day - to - day work , and administrative directives . Themes that connected the four illustra - tions together were internal communication patterns , use of time , and forms of deliberation . Specifcally , the illustrations included : ( 1 ) a vignette of the way a janitorial staf member was introduced to the robots and instructed to respond to water spillage or tech - nical malfunction , highlighting the frequency of these encounters , ( 2 ) a story depicting varied reactions to an urgent radio call from management , with four janitorial staf members being pulled away from their current tasks to respond , ( 3 ) a portrait of a staf member receiving a radio call with thought bubbles left blank to be flled in , and ( 4 ) distinct ways staf have altered the robot’s hardware , such 61 Stories from the Frontline : Recuperating Essential Worker Accounts of AI Integration DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Figure 1 : Image of a comic strip used as a visual prompt during a participatory engagement with janitorial staf . The title is Trial and Error . It illustrates the steps a frontline staf member takes as they try to fx a robot that stopped working . After emptying the water tank and de - installing the scrubbers , the robot is able to apply its UV disinfection without the tools that pick up the dirt and soot of the foors . as de - installing the scrubbers attached to the robot or emptying the robot’s water tank , so that the robot could travel through the complicated terrain of the Airport to avoid further malfunction and preserve the use of the UV light . 4 . 2 Ride - Alongs To further contextualize conversations from our workshop , we also engaged in extended observations—what we term “ride - alongs”— with staf , to experience diferent aspects of the ongoing work of integration . Ride - alongs entailed following staf as they loaded their carts , communicated and socialized with colleagues , conducted routine check - ins , and maintained the foor cleaning robots , in addition to other day - to - day aspects of their work . The half - day ride - alongs aimed to conduct further contextual inquiry while providing the research team with access to the Airport , beyond the TSA checkpoint , for several hours at a time with staf supervision at all times . Each provided further depth to the full scope of experiences varying team members may endure and experience on both sides of the Airport— “air side” and “landside” . We conducted two ride - alongs with two staf members , each spanning four and a half hours . One was a seasoned employee with 15 + years of experience with the company , and the other was new to her role , though not to airport procedural care and management . Through direct coordination with each staf member , we were able to meet with each individual at the start of each shift allowing us to spend the morning from two diferent vantage points and styles of work . The ride - alongs provided insight into the daily maintenance of the UV foor scrubbing robots , from placing them on the foor , cleaning the hardware , rebooting a malfunctioning robot , to returning them into their storage unit . 4 . 3 Data Collection Through the lens of recuperation , we took note of data through both traditional and in - the - moment means . This approach accounted for the proliferation of conversations that developed during our participatory workshops—from formal responses to sidebar chats— to capturing information at a moment’s notice during immersive ethnographic engagements . Field notes allowed us to illustrate the contexts in which janitorial staf expressed in their personal accounts of specifc circumstances and further situate their lived experience in relation to the greater ecosystem of the Airport . Handwritten jottings and audio record - ings captured immediate observations and quotes kept in context . Data was then produced in the form of ethnographic feldnotes which recorded the everyday work practices of waste laborers and their perspectives on contending with automated machinery on the ground [ 48 ] . This feld data provided a more complete picture of workplace practices , allowing us to witness activities that occur , even those that may not seem important to participants or worth reporting in formal interviews [ 49 ] . Visual prompts provided a reference to the individuals who were a part of our conversations in addition to the visual cues that sparked our conversation . This tool allowed us to point to what the con - versations entailed and who specifcally was stating what , and in response to whom . Video footage and photography captured the technology in its habitat . This tool allowed us to capture the UV foor scrubbing robots in action ( or inaction ) providing visual reference to further chart the relationship between the technology and its material environment . 4 . 4 Data Analysis We analyzed our data thematically using inductive techniques of contextualized grounded theory until a confuence of themes be - gan to emerge [ 8 ] . This approach allowed us to foreground the socio - material realities of deployment from the vantage point of janitorial staf . We developed refexive memos based on our feld notes and other empirical materials and reviewed them together 62 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Esther Kang and Sarah Fox Figure 2 : Image of a foor scrubbing robot in the conference room where our participatory engagements took place . A green light illuminates the room indicating that the robot is ready for use . Figure 3 : Image of a foor scrubbing robot with a fashing red light , indicating that it is not currently working . It is stalled out facing one of the exits of the Airport in the bag - gage claim area . during weekly meetings . Mapping our insights , we began to illus - trate internal processes and ( informal and formal ) organizational structures that shape how the UV foor scrubbing robots perform at the Airport . We then iteratively revisited and refned our inter - pretations across later rounds of analysis , building emergent foci such as diagnosis of robot errors and duties of care . Analysis of the data from our workshops and ride - alongs was further informed by complementary research projects , including an extensive investigation of news reports covering the deployment of AI in our respective industries during the 5 - years preceding the Covid - 19 pandemic [ 42 ] and a set of interviews conducted with engineers , designers and researchers working in the space of service robotics , as well as economists analyzing the COVID - 19 pandemic’s impact on essential work . 5 FINDINGS In this section , we bring the lived experiences of janitorial staf to the fore by weaving their stories—surfaced through ethnographic observation , interviews , and participatory engagements—together to paint a vivid picture of the deployment of foor cleaning robots . By recuperating their frsthand accounts , we position janitorial staf as central sources , contrasting administrative decisions made to steward the deployment process with the day - to - day realities of integration . We thread each series of vignettes to form a collective refection on essential workers’ critical role in safeguarding the public at the Airport by bridging a widening gap between organi - zational protocols for maintaining automated technology and said technology’s malfunctions . 5 . 1 Diagnosing Malfunctions 5 . 1 . 1 Janitorial perspectives . Skepticism and suspicion were un - derlying themes throughout our participatory engagements as jan - itorial staf diagnosed the AI - powered robots as a technology that required static and low trafcked environments to function prop - erly . They questioned the Airport administrators’ — or as some referred to them as “airport dignitaries” — motives for deploying the foor scrubbing robots due to their inability to efectively han - dle the Airport’s unpredictable environment . Doubt rose amongst janitorial staf as the pilot for the foor scrubbing robots reached its two - year anniversary . Each day , they reported seeing recurring kick - outs—abrupt halts , water spills , and sudden , quick movements in place—due to a range of interferences including travelers walking close to the robots or technical issues brought on by things like new signage that impeded the robots from following their original , mapped path . Such issues led staf to the conclusion that there was a misalignment between the foor cleaning robots and the Airport’s ever - changing setting . Janitorial staf often saw passengers jump in front of the AI - powered robots as some attempted to ride the roughly three foot by four - foot machines causing the robots to abruptly stop or jolt in place . “ [ The AI - powered robots ] have a bad habit of whenever there’s people going on both sides of them , they get into this thing where they start jerking back and forth and may continue to jerk back and forth even after all the people have gone , ” illustrated Mar - garet , a janitorial staf member , as she deduced from her frequent , daily encounters with the robots that they were not intended for high - trafc spaces like an airport . She likened their reactions to un - predictability and human interference to the sudden loss of control of one’s vehicle on the road—“like if your car was shimmy - ing . If you had bad tires or something and your front end was shimmy - ing , that’s what [ the AI - powered robots ] do . ” Barbara—another member of the janitorial team—brought our attention to the robots’ tendency to spill water when grinding to a halt , making clear that “it’s not lit - tle dribbles . ” She inferred that it was indicative of a larger mismatch between the robot design and the Airport . Barbara expressed that “if they moved and restarted like they’re supposed to , I [ wouldn’t ] have a problem with [ them ] . ” However , “when it stops , it’s done . ” 63 Stories from the Frontline : Recuperating Essential Worker Accounts of AI Integration DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia The types of malfunctions that the robots experienced was seen by staf as a fundamental misunderstanding on the material and social dynamics of the Airport , leading many janitorial staf to the conclusion that placing them on the foor during the day shift was “just for show” so that the robots were visible to the general public . 5 . 1 . 2 Administrative viewpoints . In line with janitorial staf’s di - agnosis that the robots were not made for complex environments such as the Airport , the framework used to design the foor scrub - bing robots indicates a need for a low trafcked area for the robot to function . Northfeld Robotics—the company that developed the system—shared that the foor cleaning robots followed a theoretical “co - bot model” , where the emphasis was on an employee and ro - bot co - worker cooperative system in that the “robot fts into their routines and takes work away from them . ” The lead shift manager and one of the Airport administrators framed this as “augmenting existing work” as they forge a connection between the foor scrub - bing robots and the night shift’s cleaning eforts . For instance , the night shift polishes the foors “during a period of time when no one else is in the building , or very few people [ are around ] to get optimal results . ” Immediately following this thorough cleaning , the day shift places the robots on the foor to “augment our overnight cleaning services . ” However , the “co - bot model” does not work well in settings that are contingent on multiple factors including unpre - dictable human behavior , as is the case with busy travelers rushing to baggage claim or the next concourse . In this case , the robot acts , in essence , separate from its “co - worker” and deviates from their “co - worker’s routine , ” fracturing the “co - bot model . ” Though the lead shift manager stated that the intention for placing the foor scrubbing robots out during the day shift was to “augment exist - ing work , ” the decision to keep them during this time period was ultimately made by airport administrators , as stated by two shift managers . This choice further underscores a statement made by the Airport’s marketing team on the organization’s two - pronged , long term vision . The frst goal was to become “a global leader in aviation” by experimenting with novel innovations to “set the curve” for their competitors . The second was focused on signaling to passengers that it was safe to travel through the introduction of state - of - the - art technologies . As airlines gradually resumed to schedule more fights , airport administrators continued to mandate that the robots be kept on the foor during the day shift despite the rise in foot trafc . The discrepancies between efciency directives , Northfeld Robotics’ intentions , and the AI - powered technology’s capabilities deepened janitorial staf’s diagnosis of misalignment . 5 . 2 The Capacity and Authority to Oversee the Robots 5 . 2 . 1 Janitorial perspectives . From our empirical engagements , we found janitorial staf desired a range of ways to regain a sense of autonomy in their roles , given that each had taken on additional tasks due to the pandemic . Scott , a janitorial staf member who had spent approximately fve years at the Airport , was part of a group of ten individuals who were the frst of the cleaning staf to be introduced to heightened sanitation protocols and use of the autonomous UV foor cleaning robots in response to the onset of the pandemic . Though Scott was present for a demonstration of the technology led by a representative from Northfeld Robotics , he Figure 4 : Image of a staf member cleaning the flter and re - flling the tank of a foor scrubbing robot . pulled one of the authors aside during a participatory engagement to share that he wished to be formally trained on how to use the robots . He believed this training would allow him to bypass the redundancies that he observed through his current line of work . He stated that the process of radio - ing his shift supervisors each time he caught one of the robots malfunctioning or being called to clean up after the robots without warning didn’t seem like an efcient way to operate as it created additional work . Scott was perplexed as to why he and his peers weren’t provided with the opportunity to be trained . As he saw it , the current process created an informal system dependent on one to two shift managers who had been selected to receive dedicated training , but were weighed down with other , more distant duties . Scott’s frustration and confusion were not isolated feelings ; the sentiment across the cleaning staf in both of our workshops was a sense of resignation and irritation on the current method of ad - dressing malfunctioning robots . However , rather than wanting to take on additional work , four janitorial staf members expressed a wish for an app that enabled members of the cleaning staf to redi - rect a robot’s route to where it is most needed ( rather than the set course it currently followed ) . For instance , if a passenger notifed airport staf of a nearby cofee spill , janitorial staf could use the app to send the robot to the appropriate location to clean up the spill immediately . Alternatively , they suggested hiring one individual whose job was fully dedicated to the maintenance , tracking , and management of the feet of foor cleaning robots . Janitorial staf had previously assumed this would be the role of the technician from Northfeld Robotics , yet it turned out not to be so . They stated that if one person was dedicated to this role , then it would release the additional cognitive load that members of the day shift currently carry in monitoring the devices from afar ( and on top of their other responsibilities ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Administrative viewpoints . From our ride - alongs , we found janitorial staf’s limited access to training in the maintenance of the foor scrubbing robots was due to a hierarchical selection pro - cess . Rafael , the cleaning staf’s lead manager , referred to his shift 64 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Esther Kang and Sarah Fox managers as the “everyday coaches” implicitly stating that they are tasked with the responsibility of equipping janitorial staf with the training appropriate to their scope of work . Rafael believed that he is the “theory” and his supervisors are the “practice” or the applica - tion of BFM’s approach to facilities maintenance . Similarly , while airport administrators acknowledge that frontline workers “buy - in into the technique or the strategy” of technology deployment is pivotal to its success , they did not directly shape how training was determined . Antoni—a senior shift manager who received the most training in the foor scrubbing robots and has a background in mechanical engineering—was placed at the helm of determining protocol on ways to train employees on the new technology . From our observa - tions , interviews , and participatory engagements , we found that three variables became key determinants in how he approached the training process . Firstly , Antoni was not adequately prepared to meet the implicit expectations of airport administrators . For exam - ple , during one of our ride - alongs , Antoni walked us through varied aspects of his daily routine including a checklist provided to him by airport administrators to guide maintenance procedures of the foor cleaning robots . As Antoni went through the document , he grew increasingly agitated and circled fve out of the fourteen tasks to indicate that he did not receive training on the selected items . “I don’t know what these things are , ” he stated as he held the check - list , underscoring his confusion on administrative expectations that were meant to guide his day - to - day work . Secondly , the process of allocating additional tasks and training to janitorial staf is done through a hierarchical process rather than one based on merit . For instance , janitorial staf members are pre - sented with the same opportunities to grow professionally , includ - ing aspects of management that might be absorbed into their role or training on a particular service or product . Upon announcement , any interested parties may write their names on a sign - up sheet from which shift managers select who is given the opportunity , with priority given to the most senior stafer . Antoni emphasized that the option of opening up the opportunity to maintain the robots to additional stafers does not guarantee that managerial eforts are strengthened . Instead , according to him , the most senior staf member taking on additional responsibility does not mean that they are the most qualifed or well - positioned to take on the task . Antoni saw a discrepancy between the skills required for the position and those possessed by workers most likely to be given the role , increasing the chances for the technology to be improperly managed . Thirdly , Northfeld Robotics’ inconsistent communica - tion on repair and maintenance updates , as detailed in the previous section , placed the safety of the general public and janitorial staf at risk . Antoni also noted being unsure of when remote software updates were made or when an issue fagged by cleaning staf had been addressed . “I just wish they would communicate , ” Antoni re - peatedly said throughout our ride - along , emphasizing the need for comprehensive follow - ups on requests , in addition to specifc dates and times when updates would be made and if these changes would alter the robots’ mapped routes . When we asked a technician from Northfeld Robotics on ways to optimally troubleshoot the robot malfunctions , he framed it as a need to understand “how it is meant to be , ” or how the robots were intended to perform — underscoring that “some customers . . . don’t necessarily embrace the operators’ autonomy . ” He stated that the biggest challenge is “getting people accustomed to the equipment in its operation” pointing to an expectation that all actors at the Airport—administrators , facilities , cleaning staf , and passengers— adjust to the design of the robot . 5 . 3 Concerns for Safety and Liability 5 . 3 . 1 Janitorial perspectives . An ongoing theme across our partici - patory engagements , observations , and interviews was the pressing concern with the safety of passengers . BFM and the County Author - ity that oversee the Airport see slip - and - falls—traveler accidents that can lead to legal ramifcations—as a primary concern . Prevent - ing and rectifying situations that may lead to such accidents was a core principle in janitorial staf’s work and efciency directives they received . The malfunctions of the AI - powered technology heightened concerns for safety and liability amongst janitorial staf leading to catastrophic thinking grounded in near accidents they witnessed in their day - to - day work . Four janitorial staf members who joined one of our participatory workshops immediately began to discuss how the shortcomings of the AI - powered robots could lead to safety hazards . All four of them had spent roughly fve to ten years at the Airport as part of the cleaning staf and felt as though the choice to embed the technology to their line of work caused disruption . Jack expressed concern about the demand to be in , what seemed like , multiple locations with very little notice , due to the need to keep track of their typical route and the robots’ needs . His colleague , Aggie , underscored that the expectation to drop what they are currently doing to tend to the robots in a diferent location was unrealistic . The conversation quickly led to a tallying of the near misses jani - torial staf had witnessed on the job . For example , one staf member shared the story of a robot almost running into a passenger who suddenly stopped in their tracks to check their phone . As they were doing so , a robot headed in their direction only to miss the pas - senger by a slim margin . Others remarked that random passengers would jump in front of the robots to test with them , deepening anx - iety about liability issues amongst janitorial staf . Aggie stated that they could see the robots falling down the escalator at some point . “It’s like the movie Short Circuit ! , ” Jack added . Laughter erupted and several more agreed that a partially functioning technology like the foor cleaning robots could depart from its intended path to wreak havoc on the wider public . Short Circuit is a flm set primarily in a robotics lab for military technology where iteration and demos are common . Number 5 , one of the experimental military robots , fears reprogramming and evades capture by venturing beyond the walls of the lab and into the public . The flm follows his encounters with the general public and the disruptions Number 5 causes to daily life . The shared sentiment that brings together the flm and the UV foor scrubbing robots at the Airport exposes the shared misgivings staf see between the flm’s plot and the unfolding of the Airport’s deployment process for the foor scrubbing robots . All four agreed that there should be a role dedicated to robot maintenance and in communication to avoid janitorial staf bearing the cognitive load and emotional burden of caring for the robots in what seemed like constant anticipation of an acute risk to the public . 65 Stories from the Frontline : Recuperating Essential Worker Accounts of AI Integration DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia 5 . 3 . 2 Administrative viewpoints . In an interview with an Airport administrator , he expressed that the “ultimate goal is to have a better tomorrow” by means of innovation . In the wake of the pandemic , this entailed responding swiftly to the acute public health crisis as an organization . Initially , the administrators were unsure of how to address an unprecedented moment . An operations engineer , for example , purchased an untested disinfection device marketed for cleaning handrails after seeing a write - up in the industry press . He recalled thinking , “Hey , why don’t we use this in [ the US ] ? Because it was mostly in Europe [ at the time ] . ” Unfortunately , it ended up not being an appropriate ft for the context nor was it efective , but this example shows how airport administrators made formal and informal attempts to quickly respond to the uncertainty of the crisis in the name of safety for their staf and the general public . Staying in line with their broad “smart” airport vision , the Airport later partnered with Northfeld Robotics who designated a technician to guide the robot roll - out process . Working directly with the cleaning staf and serving as the pri - mary point of contact to address mechanical and operational issues , the Northfeld Robotics’ technician was the frst to respond in the event of a robot malfunction . The technician typically received a notifcation directly from the robot’s system while also getting some type of electronic communication from cleaning staf . He then assessed whether to address the issue remotely or in person as he also understood that “it [ wasn’t ] good for the robot to be , especially in the high trafc area like the Airport , sitting like a dead duck . ” According to Antoni and Rafael , they rarely overlapped with the technician due to the designated days for the technician’s site visits coinciding with Antoni’s days of . Antoni put into place a “makeshift practice” to determine for himself whether the Northfeld Robotics technician came by to respond to maintenance issues . His method entailed parking the malfunctioning foor cleaning robot in a corner of the storage closet designated for the technology . On top of the robot , Antoni would place an unused scrubber over the area that required the Northfeld Robotics’ technician’s attention . If the scrubber was moved in any way , then it signaled to Antoni that “someone addressed his concern . ” In addition to this “tactic” to gauge whether the technician’s help was received , Antoni pointed out two key areas during one of our ride - alongs where a robot had deviated away from its typical route and followed an unanticipated path : a set of rubber mats near the start of its route and the entrance to a retail shop typically at its halfway point . We frst drove toward a medium sized seating area and a line of quiet shops . He pointed to the edges of the rubber mats in front of a freestanding cart and stated the robots “tore up” the corners repeatedly . Antoni then drove us a few inches from the entrance to a retail shop to illustrate how close one of the robots came to entering a store . The sales associate attested to the sudden , unexpected experience where she believed that the robot was about to enter the store as a customer was being served . “At the end of the day , it’s all about safety , ” Antoni stated throughout our conversation . During another observation , Tegan—one of the shift managers— pointed out two locations where the robots had or had nearly crashed into existing businesses . In the frst location , Tegan stated , the robot ran into a concession stand . In the second location , it moved in the direction of restaurant seating missing their bar stools by a slim margin . In all four instances , pointed out by Antoni and Tegan , they believed these run - ins immediately followed a re - mote software update administered by Northfeld Robotics . Antoni wished there “was a clearer or better communication line” between Northfeld Robotics and the cleaning staf , not to “know what the specifc software updates are , ” but rather “what the anticipated route and behavior changes might be . ” However , the impact of such updates and the decision to update software in the frst place was not conveyed to staf . The lack of communication from Northfeld Robotics , as well as the lack of training eforts beyond the manage - rial team , made staf feel uneasy and arrive at the conclusion that the gap in communication posed a risk to several parties—retail associates , passengers , and janitorial staf themselves . 5 . 4 Automated Technology Indicative of Impending Future 5 . 4 . 1 Janitorial perspectives . Throughout our participatory engage - ments , acute concerns surrounding job security were voiced by the majority of the participants . Geof , a janitorial staf member who was at frst wary of speaking up , shared , “instead of bringing a machine , they should have hired two people . ” He underscored the jarring nature of selecting machinery to conduct work rather than supporting the livelihoods of staf in the midst of a global pandemic . Margaret , a janitorial staf member who was upset about the ad - ditional time spent on cleaning after the robots , stated that the eventual demise of their vocation will be due to the implementation of AI - powered technologies . In response to Margaret’s frustration , Janice and Lucy—relatively new additions to the janitorial team— nodded in agreement as they , too , believed that the inclusion of automated technology meant that the end of their profession was inevitable . This stirred forms of doubt and speculation amongst the group as they asked “what is the purpose of these robots” and “does the UV light , the supreme technology , work ? ” The intangibil - ity of evidence to support the claim that the transition was worth their time and fatigue bolstered individual and collective beliefs that hiring humans would be more benefcial . Geof afrmed his initial statement before he left the room . He pointed to one of the folding chairs in the conference room and noted the black smudge smeared across the seat . As he highlighted the stain , he remarked “a human [ would ] see the stain on the chair and be able to address it immediately . I can’t say the same for the robot . ” He underscored the adaptability of humans who can address issues at a moment’s notice , frmly making the point that the robot would never be able to provide the same results . The concern across most janitorial staf members we spoke with centered around who was being asked to shoulder the burden of pushing forward an innovative solution , particularly as it was being made during a time of acute precarity for them . 5 . 4 . 2 Administrative viewpoints . Our interviews with airport ad - ministrators and managerial staf revealed that they believed that janitorial staf did not subscribe to the myth that automation tech - nology would evidently displace their work . Though one Airport administrator noted initial anxiety among staf may be “normal apprehension about new technology [ generally ] , ” he was confdent it would quickly pass . Comparing the deployment to his previous professional experience in a union factory facing automation , he 66 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Esther Kang and Sarah Fox felt as though the Airport’s approach to the technology roll - out ad - equately took this fear into account . Managerial staf underscored the attention placed on addressing the initial concerns janitorial staf had on the immediate impact of the robots to their job security as well as what it might be indicative of in the future . Rafael detailed that the janitorial staf “appreciated that he gave them answers , ” and that he placed emphasis on the robots augmenting their existing work . Similarly , the technician from Northfeld Robotics believed that “this kind of work helped [ staf ] be more successful” due to it “advanc [ ing ] their job skills , advanc [ ing ] their career skills to say that they are able to run a robotics curve . ” Each key touchpoint for the janitorial staf—from airport administrators who make execu - tive decisions to technicians who oversee the maintenance of the robot to managerial staf who shape their day - to - day operations— acknowledged staf’s initial fear of losing their jobs and believed these anxieties were addressed through careful communication . 6 DISCUSSION From our two years of research—entailing qualitative interviews , observational research , participatory engagements—we actively sought to recuperate workers’ perspectives on and relationships to the enactment of technology deployment in the wake of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Our primary line of inquiry on whose stories underpin these administrative and design decisions [ 32 ] remained the throughline that wove each phase of our research . By devel - oping a robust and vivid illustration of their lived socio - material realities , we reveal a widening gap between administrators’ per - ception of staf [ 16 ] and workers’ increasing accumulation of tasks . The discrepancy manifested in a set of implicit expectations that informed organizational protocols and procedures that shaped the workers’ day - to - day , made evident through the direct accounts from janitorial staf at the Airport . Through eforts to recuperate and re - center workers’ accounts in this research , we found that a reevaluation of and reorientation to method , as it stands , was equally vital to telling these stories anew as we delved into the gaps between administration and worker experiences . We build on traditions of counter - storytelling and counter - framing [ 30 ] to widen the perspectives from which de - sign narratives are often told . This allowed us to gain insight from the perspectives of janitorial staf and their shift managers to pro - vide a more thorough understanding on the evolution of work that has taken place since the height of the pandemic . Our workshops exposed the gravity of workers’ frustrations , the infuence of admin - istrator’s presumptions , and ofered worker - centered alternatives to existing protocols and procedures . Our ride - alongs further revealed inconsistencies across scales and experiences from diferent posi - tions within the Airport that compounded the day - to - day working conditions of janitorial staf . Above all , our direct engagement with janitorial staf underscored the undeniable importance of workers conducting invisible labor propping up technological systems and their advancement , without which the entire system would falter . 6 . 1 Grievances as Means to Shape Organizational Protocols and Procedures The ability to air one’s grievances without fear of retribution is an essential part of any organizational structure , particularly within unionized contexts such as the Airport . Through the recuperation of workers’ stories , we highlight the importance of holding a “fem - inist ear” [ 1 ] , or staying open to hearing the complaints of those who bear the burden of deploying and maintaining the innovative technologies that often emerge from design and academic institu - tions [ 15 ] . We also point to the crucial role that the circulation of “war stories” [ 29 ] holds after typical development processes end . The exchange of knowledge surrounding recovery from unantic - ipated technological malfunctions connect individual grievances and incentive strategies in ways that could meaningfully reshape the initial design . From our workshops and interviews , we found that workers’ lived accounts attest to the consistent malfunctioning of the robots , while making legitimate diagnoses of potential core issues and suggestions for deepened development . Beyond design - ing with predetermined understandings of particular sites and the stakeholders who inhabit them , responsible innovation requires on - going deliberation and imaginative processes centered on care and reciprocity [ 50 , 51 ] . Toward this end , we recommend constructing spaces where complaints can be shared and building collaborations with organizations that have experience bargaining for workers’ rights to inform institutional , structural , and technological change . Active collaboration with advocacy organizations places em - phasis on recuperating stories of workers and the de - centering of designers and engineers in the full articulation of innovation . Through the vocalization of concerns and demands of the work - place , advocacy organizations converge individual claims and col - lective realities to inform and redirect institutional decision making . This pivotal role is exemplifed in a recent case where , after a two month strike , hotel workers across the US with their union Unite Here negotiated a contract to include a clause that dramatically shifts power dynamics between administrators and frontline em - ployees , specifcally , in the age of AI - powered technologies [ 43 ] . This move marks an expansion of concerns from traditional “bread and butter” issues like pay and benefts to the need to negotiate tech implementation and accompanying training procedures . The details state that workers will be at the bargaining table to dis - cuss the roll - out processes around new technologies , countering typical top - down approaches where managerial staf would deter - mine deployment without consulting workers [ 43 ] . Advocating for a say in shaping equitable conditions and the ( spatial , physi - cal , and mental ) day - to - day experiences of essential staf directly connects with the Airport’s janitorial staf’s desire for an active feedback loop between worker and Airport executives . This focus on reclaiming power around the implementation of technological systems in workplaces extends our site - specifc research and brings it into a wider discourse . Not in isolation , these measures can be seen in relation to eforts to unionize essential industries with re - cent notable examples including Amazon in Staten Island , NY [ 44 ] and Starbucks stores across the US [ 45 ] . This growing interest in the labor movement calls on design researchers and practitioners to humbly approach implementation processes of technological systems and purposefully design conditions for worker - centered collaborations and partnerships to take place such that the future of essential work in the age of AI - powered technologies is designed with and for workers at the outset . 67 Stories from the Frontline : Recuperating Essential Worker Accounts of AI Integration DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia 6 . 2 Workers as a Core Source of Ethical AI Workers’ perspectives underscored the inconsistencies in the de - ployment of technology while unveiling the institutional barriers to conducting ethical AI . From our participatory workshops , we found that janitorial staf were burdened with the malfunction - ing of robots on a daily basis , amassing into an accumulation of unaccounted labor compounded by a lack of training . As a result , staf felt as if they were simply a means to an end . This insight contradicted the acknowledgement airport administrators ofered during interviews on the importance of janitorial staf’s role in a successful roll - out process . Through pairing participatory work - shops with qualitative interviews , we were able to cross reference acknowledgments , intentions , and material outputs . The incorpo - ration of participatory practices intentionally bridged a widening divide we witnessed in our feldwork between managerial staf’s understanding and the lived realities of janitorial staf . This misper - ception contributed to organizational protocols that deprioritized conditions that may relieve the accumulation of work for janito - rial staf and reinforced asymmetrical power relations between administrator and worker . To subvert this process , our participa - tory practices—in line with their origins in the labor movement in Scandinavian countries—centered the day - to - day realities of janito - rial staf’s work , conceptually and methodologically , and framed deployment processes as politically situated and place - based . These observations align with recent HCI scholarship on the intensifed ( but unacknowledged ) work of adopting digital tools necessary for remote , fexible work arrangements . As many knowl - edge workers have experienced over the course of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the pivot to online work has led to a need to learn digital maintenance skills to troubleshoot the tools regularly used , which workers report breaks up their workfow and takes time away from “real work” [ 52 ] . Whiting and Symon [ 52 ] note employees “com - plain about the technology but do not count up the hours spent and its equivalent in working time , accepting and internalizing the responsibility for such tasks as an inevitable consequence of ‘choosing’ to work fexibly . ” In other eforts , scholars seek to enu - merate the hours of unpaid , invisible labor crowdworkers perform in order to fnd worthwhile tasks , message requesters , and manage payments via Amazon Mechanical Turk [ 53 ] . Newly accounting for this uncompensated work , they note a reduction in previously reported worker earnings by an average of nearly 25 % . Taken to - gether , this research calls out the need for continued interrogation of the efects of organizational pivots in technology use , as well as the ways in which low wage workers tend to bear undue burdens of innovation . Turning back to our own feld site , our qualitative interviews , half - day ride - alongs , and the application of participatory practices made it clear that the implementation process of AI - powered tech - nologies was a vital part of determining the direction of a techno - logical system . With this emphasis , we recommend repositioning workers as central fgures to conducting ethical AI—for the pur - poses of having a roll - out process that is dignifed and respectful , extending beyond efciency objectives . This entails designing the conditions that allow for fair contract negotiations that center the worker ; developing training tailored to the needs and capacities of workers ; determining the relationship between worker and technol - ogy based on their day - to - day realities ; and setting administrative decisions on protocols in collaboration with essential workers . 6 . 3 Retelling and Remaking as Modalities for Narrative and Method Building In line with the values of recuperation , we extend this approach to the development and confguration of methods with a critical eye on design’s reliance on framing and frameworks—a methodological manner of demonstrating positionality and expressing normative understandings [ 30 ] . The idiosyncrasies of the janitorial staf’s day - to - day and our continual practice of centering workers informed how we expanded “the reach of its investigative imagination to new formulations of research practice” [ 33 ] . In doing so , we actively deconstructed participatory design workshops , as they are typically practiced , to allow the socio - material realities of janitorial staf at the Airport to determine temporal , afective , and experiential forms of each session . This remaking considered the short window of time used to convene as a team prior to the start of their shift , their mental capacity to engage in a conversation at an early hour , design prompts to guide the brief engagements , and their preferred location at the Airport . Actively reenvisioning workplace practices as they are tradition - ally rehearsed provided us an opportunity to move past a superfcial acknowledgement of workers’ experiences to one where this un - derstanding is deeply embedded in the design of methods we used . In this light , we recommend evaluating traditional design research methods to ensure that they are indeed worker - centered . This en - tails allowing the socio - material realities of the workers to guide the development of the methods with regards to location , activ - ity , materials , length , focus , and underpinning logics . We share these lessons as a way to ofer ways to conduct worker - centered design as an application and in the construction of best practices for organizations that intersect technologies and essential work . In line with our fndings on reorientation and reconfguration to methods and application as they stand , we ofer these insights with the understanding and acknowledgement of their complexity and contingency . Furthermore , our aim is to reposition workers in the discourse of ethical AI so that the design of their work is informed by the gravity of their contributions , in addition to the dignifed manner for which it should be accounted . 7 CONCLUSION Through the reconfguration of how and whose stories are told within complex organizations , our research brings to the fore the pivotal role essential staf play in implementing technological sys - tems and argues that their work is innovative , rather than supple - mentary . This paper draws from theories of invisible labor , everyday design , and the feminist strategy of recuperation to orient inquiry toward the lived realities of janitorial staf , foregrounding the need for a worker - centered framework in our collective , critical prac - tice . As design researchers , it is important to continually refect on the hidden aspects of our technological systems by returning to the question that foregrounds an understanding that sociotech - nical processes are politically situated : whose stories underpin our administrative and design decisions ? 68 DIS ’22 , June 13 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Australia Esther Kang and Sarah Fox ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We extend deep appreciation to the janitorial staf who shared their thoughts and experiences with us .
