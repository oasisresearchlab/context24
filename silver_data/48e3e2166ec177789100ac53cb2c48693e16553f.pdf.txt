The liquid facets gene encodes the homolog of vertebrate endocytic Epsin , an endocytic adapter protein . In Drosophila , Liquid facets is a core component of the Notch signaling pathway required in the signaling cells for ligand endocytosis and signaling . Why ligand internalization by the signaling cells is essential for signaling is a mystery . The requirement for Liquid facets is a hint at the answer , and the genes identiﬁed in this screen provide further clues . Mutant alleles of clathrin heavy chain , Rala , split ends , and auxilin were identiﬁed as enhancers . We describe the mutant alleles and mutant phenotypes of Rala and aux . We discuss the relevance of all of these genetic interactions to the function of Liquid facets in Notch signaling . D ROSOPHILA Liquid facets ( Lqf ) is the homolog of vertebrate endocytic epsin , an adapter for inter - nalization of proteins that span the plasma membrane ( H . C hen et al . 1998 ) . Endocytic Epsin is a modular protein with an ENTH ( E psin N - t erminal h omology ) domainthatbindstheplasmamembraneandmotifsthatbindubiquitin , clathrin , the AP - 2 core adapter complex , and EH - domain - containing endocytic factors ( reviewed in W endland 2002 ) . In Drosophila , Lqf is a core component of the Notch signaling pathway ( O verstreet et al . 2004 ; W ang and S truhl 2004 , 2005 ) . Internalization of the transmem - brane Notch ligands , Delta and Serrate , is required for signaling ( P arks et al . 2000 ; L ai et al . 2001 ; P avlopoulos et al . 2001 ; L e B orgne and S chweisguth 2003a ; L i and B aker 2004 ; O verstreet et al . 2004 ; W ang and S truhl 2004 , 2005 ; L ai et al . 2005 ; L eborgne et al . 2005a ) . Although the role of endocytosis in signaling is a mystery , what is clear is that the essential endocytic event abso - lutely requires Lqf ( O verstreet et al . 2004 ; W ang and S truhl 2004 , 2005 ) . There are two classes of models to explain why Lqf - dependent endocytosis of Delta or Serrate by the signal - ing cells is required for Notch activation in the receiving cells : postreceptor - binding models and prereceptor - bind - ing models ( reviewed in L e B orgne and S chweisguth 2003b ; L e B orgne et al . 2005b ; F ischer et al . 2006 ) . The postreceptor - binding model supposes that internaliza - tion of Delta bound to Notch provides a pulling force that exposes the extracellular domain cleavage site on the receptor ( P arks et al . 2000 ) . Cleavage of the Notch extracellular domain is prerequisite for cleavage of the intracellular domain , which is the ultimate step in Notch activation and results in a small portion of the receptor translocating to the nucleus where it regulates tran - scription ( reviewed in F ortini 2002 ) . The prereceptor - binding model is that Notch ligands are somehow processed within endosomes and then either recycled to the cell surface in active form or secreted in active form as exosomes ( L e B orgne and S chweisguth 2003a ; W ang and S truhl 2004 ) . The precise role of Lqf in endocytosis of Notch ligands is unclear . In the eye and the wing , the lqf null mutant phenotype is indistinguishable from the Delta and / or Serrate mutant phenotypes ( O verstreet et al . 2004 ; W ang and S truhl 2004 ) . One explanation for the apparent speciﬁcity of Lqf might be that Lqf directs Delta or Serrate into special endosomes for processing and recycling ( W ang and S truhl 2004 ) . Alternatively , Lqf might play a more general role in internalization of plasma membrane proteins that use ubiquitin as an internalization signal , and the Notch ligands are simply the only such proteins whose endocytosis is absolutely necessary for normal development of the ﬂy . To better understand the role of Lqf in Notch sig - naling , we performed a mutagenesis screen of the 1 These authors contributed equally to this work . 2 Present address : Ambion , 2130 Woodward , Austin , TX 78744 . 3 Present address : Department of Biological Chemistry , University of California , 675 Charles E .

By overexpressing lqf 1 in the eye with a transgene , we generated an eye - speciﬁc lqf mutant . In a screen for dominant enhancers of the eye phenotype , we identi - ﬁed four genes , three of which had not been known to interact genetically with lqf . These results suggest po - tential roles for the enhancer genes in Lqf function .

Allﬂy crosseswere carried out at 25 (cid:3) using standard food unless otherwise indicated . Mutagenesis and enhancer screening : Males were treated with EMS ( Sigma , St . Louis ) according to L ewis and B acher ( 1968 ) . F 1 males or females were screened for enhanced eye roughness with a Leica MZ6 dissecting microscope . Meiotic recombination mapping of C18 and 727 complementation group alleles : The chromosome 2 - linked enhancer C18 was lo - calized near al as follows . Virgin females of the genotype C18 / al dp b c px were crossed to al dp b Bl c px / CyO males and 10 – 20 non - CyO males with parental chromosomes or with each of the 8 single recombinant types were collected . To score each chromosome for the enhancer C18 , single males were crossed with w ; glrs - lqf virgins and the eyes of the non - Bl progeny were assessed . The key result was that the recombination frequency between al and C18 is very low : no al chromosomes also had C18 , and all al 1 chromosomes contained C18 . The chromo - some 3 - linked enhancer 727 ( aux 727 ) was localized between th and cu as follows . Virgin females of the genotype 727 / ru h th st cu sr e ca were crossed to ru h th st cu sr e Pr ca / TM6B males and 10 non - TM6B males with parental chromosomes or with each of the 10 of single recombinant types were collected . To score each chromosome for the enhancer 727 , single males were crossed with glrs - lqf ; th st cu sr e / TM6B virgin females and the eyes of the non - Pr progeny were assessed . The key results were that no th cu chromosomes contained 727 , all th 1 cu 1 chromo - somes contained 727 , and th cu 1 or th 1 cu chromosomes could contain 727 or not . Physical mapping of C18 : Twenty - seven chromosomes with deﬁciencies in polytene region 21 – 24 were tested for comple - mentation of the lethality of C18 . Two of them [ Df ( 2L ) net - PMF and Df ( 2L ) net - PM47C ] failed to complement . Two deﬁciency chromosomes that do complement [ Df ( 2L ) PM45 and Df ( 2L ) al ] provided critical additional information . Using the informa - tion on FlyBase ( G rumbling et al . 2006 ) regarding the break - points of these four deﬁciencies , we localized C18 to a region between the genes Glutamine synthetase 1 and kismet , which contains 12 genes and includes split ends ( spen ) . Male recombination mapping of 727 alleles : Enhancer 727 was mapped with respect to 12 different P elements located between polytene positions 78A and 84B on the basis of methods described in B . C hen et al . ( 1998 ) . First , a th st 727 sr ca chromosome was generated . Males of the genotype w ; CyO , D 2 - 3 / Sco ; th st 727 sr ca / TM6B were crossed with virgins 1164 S . H . Eun et al . containing the P element to generate CyO , D 2 - 3 / 1 ; th st 727 sr ca / P males . These were crossed with ru h th st cu sr e ca virgins and the progeny were examined for male recombination events . The progeny with chromosomes that had recombined between st and sr could be distinguished easily by their eye colors . The vast majority of the progeny had wild - type ( P / ru h th st cu sr e ca ) or orange ( th st 727 sr ca / ru h th st cu sr e ca ) eyes , the latter because they are homozygous st ca . Progeny with rare recombinant chromosomes ( th st sr 1 ca 1 / ru h th st cu sr e ca or th 1 st 1 sr ca / ru h th st cu sr e ca ) had bright red ( st / st ) eyes or brown ( ca / ca ) eyes , respectively . Recombination between the markers th and sr served as a second check on the origins of the recombinant chromosomes . Recombinant chromosomes were scored for the presence or absence of 727 by crossing with glrs - lqf ; if 727 is present , half of the progeny should have the enhanced rough - eye phenotype and if 727 is absent , none of them should . Two P elements in 82A ( P { y 1 w 1 SUP } KG08740 and P { y 1 w 1 EP } CG14641 ) were found to ﬂank 727 and these were used to map two other aux alleles ( L7 and F37 ) that were isolated as enhancers . For this analysis , st F37 sr e ca and st L7 sr e ca chromosomes were used in identical experiments . Rare recombinant chromosomes were assayed for both the enhancer functions of F37 and L7 and also for their lethality in trans to 727 . Both the enhancer and lethality functions mapped between the two P elements that ﬂanked 727 . Males of the genotype w ; CyO , D 2 - 3 / 1 ; st F37 sr e ca / P were crossed with ru h th st cu sr e Pr ca / TM6B , Bri virgins and rare re - combinant chromosomes were identiﬁed in ﬂies with bright red ( st / st ) or brown ( ca / ca ) eyes ( st sr 1 e 1 ca 1 / ru h th st cu sr e Pr ca or st 1 sr e ca / ru h th st cu sr e Pr ca , respectively ) . The sr and e markers served as second checks on the origins of the chromosomes . The recombinant chromosomes were scored for the presence or absence of the lethal function of F37 by crossing with 727 / TM6B and determining if any non - Pr and non - TM6B progeny were viable . Male progeny of this cross containing the recombinant chromosomes ( st sr 1 e 1 ca 1 / TM6B or st 1 sr e ca / TM6B ) were crossed with glrs - lqf virgin females to assess if they carried the enhancer of function of F37 . If so , all of the non - TM6B progeny should have enhanced rough eyes and , if not , none of them should have enhanced rough eyes . Both the enhancer and lethality in trans to 727 functions of L7 and F37 mapped between the two P elements that ﬂank the enhancer function of 727 . ComplementationofAA1andBB2 : The two X - linked enhancers that were on hemizygous lethal X chromosomes ( AA1 and BB2 ) were tested for complementation by the clathrin heavy chain ( chc 1 ) gene in a transgene ( P { w 1 chc 1 } ) and also as a duplication [ Dp ( 1 ; Y ) shi 1 y 1 B S ] that contains chc 1 . To test for complemen - tation by the transgene , AA1 / FM7c virgin females were crossed to chc 3 ; P { w 1 chc 1 } / 1 males . Non - FM7c male progeny will be hemizygous for AA1 and will be present only if P { w 1 chc 1 } complements the lethality of AA1 . The same crosses were per - formed for AA1 and BB2 and in both cases non - FM7c male progeny that were wild type in appearance were produced . To test Dp ( 1 ; Y ) shi 1 y 1 B S for complementation , chc 1 / Dp ( 1 ; Y ) shi 1 y 1 B S males were crossed with AA1 / FM7c or BB2 / FM7c females . Non - FM7c male progeny that appeared wild type were produced , indicating that Dp ( 1 ; Y ) shi 1 y 1 B S complements AA1 and BB2 . Physical mapping of EE1 : All stocks in the X chromosome duplication kit were tested for complementation of the rough eye , bristle , and wing mutant phenotypes of EE1 hemizygous males . In each case , males bearing the duplication were crossed with EE1 / FM7c females , and the progeny were scored for the presence of non - FM7c males with normal morphology , in - dicative of complementation . The males used in the above crosses were simply those present in the duplication stocks , with two exceptions : the stocks of Dp ( 1 ; f ) y 1 ( BL no . 5459 ) and Dp ( 1 ; f ) LJ9 ( BL no . 3219 ) required additional crosses because the males are C ( 1 ; Y ) . For Dp ( 1 ; f ) y 1 , males carrying the dupli - cation were generated by crossing virgin females of the geno - type C ( 1 ) RM , y / Dp ( 1 ; f ) y 1 to yw males to produce virgin female progeny of the genotype C ( 1 ) RM , y / Y / Dp ( 1 ; f ) y 1 . These females were crossed with yw males to generate males that contain the duplication , which are of the genotype y / Y / Dp ( 1 ; f ) y 1 . Analo - gous crosses were performed to generate males containing Dp ( 1 ; f ) LJ9 . Once a duplication that complemented EE1 was identiﬁed [ Tp ( 1 ; 2 ) w - ec ] , it was used to test 11 deﬁciency chro - mosomes for complementation of EE1 as follows . EE1 / FM7c virgin females were crossed with FM6 ; CyO / Sco males to gen - erate EE1 / FM6 ; CyO virgin females . These were crossed with Tp ( 1 ; 2 ) w - ec / 1 males to generate males of the genotype EE1 ; Dp ( 1 : 2 ) w - ec / CyO , which were crossed with females containing various Df chromosomes in trans to an FM balancer . The prog - eny were examined to determine if there were any EE1 / Df ; CyO / 1 [ Dp ( 1 ; 2 ) w - ec not present ] females present that appear wild type . If so , the Df chromosome complements EE1 ; if not , the Df chromosome does not complement . We found thattwoduplications complement EE1 : Tp ( 1 ; 2 ) w - ec and Dp ( 1 ; 3 ) w 1 67k . This information , taken together with the observation that two overlapping duplications [ Dp ( 1 ; 2 ; Y ) w 1 and Dp ( 1 ; 2 ) 51b ] do not complement EE1 , deﬁned the region con - taining EE - 1 as 3D6 – 3E8 . In addition , we found that three deﬁ - ciencychromosomes [ Df ( 1 ) RR62 , Df ( 1 ) N264 - 105 , and Df ( 1 ) Exel6233 ] failed to complement EE1 . Of these , the breakpoints of only Df ( 1 ) Exel6233 are identiﬁed molecularly and thus deﬁned the distal endpoint of the region containing EE1 . Taken together , the duplication and deﬁciency data implicate the genes be - tween Ilp7 and CG32781 , including Rala , as candidates for EE1 . Molecular biology and histology : Molecular biology manip - ulations were performed using standard techniques or instruc - tions from the manufacturers of enzymes and kits . Enzymes used for cloning were obtained from New England BioLabs ( Beverly , MA ) , Roche , or Invitrogen ( San Diego ) . Oligonucleo - tides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies . Construction of the glrs - lqf transgene and transformants : An (cid:2) 3 . 4 - kb Asc I fragment containing a Flag - tagged lqf cDNA ( C adavid et al . 2000 ) was obtained from pBSKII - Flag - lqf ( C adavid et al . 2000 ) and ligated into the Asc I site of pglrs ( H uang and F ischer - V ize 1996 ) . P element transformation of w 1118 was performed using standard methods . A primary glrs - lqf transformant line obtained was mobilized to generate the line used for the mutant screen . Construction of the genomic aux 1 transgene and transformants : A 21 , 081 - bp DNA fragment containing the aux 1 gene was obtained by restricting BACR15O02 ( G rumbling et al . 2006 ) with Nhe I and Sac II . The aux 1 DNA fragment was ligated into the vector pFOW ( S . H . E un and J . A . F ischer , unpublished results ) restricted with Nhe I and Sac II . The Sac II site in the resulting plasmid was changed to Nhe I by ligating annealed oligonucleotides of the sequence 5 9 - TGCTAGCAGC - 3 9 into the Sac II site . An (cid:2) 21 - kb Nhe I fragment containing the aux 1 gene was obtained from the resulting plasmid and ligated into the Xba I site of pCasper4 ( T hummel and P irrotta 1992 ) . P element transformation was performed by Genetic Services ( Sudbury , MA ) . DNA analysis of aux alleles and Rala EE1 : Templates for DNA sequence determination of aux alleles were prepared by poly - merase chain reaction ( PCR ) of genomic DNA from hom - ozygous larvae or from a single adult ﬂy ( L7 ) . As most aux homozygotes die before the Tb marker on TM6B is evident in the larvae , stocks were balanced using TM6B GFP and 5 – 10 small nonﬂuorescing larvae were collected and homogenized in SB ( 10 m m Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 2 , 1 m m EDTA , 25 m m NaCl ) . Template in SB ( 2 – 4 m l ) was mixed with 2 m l primer ( 200 ng ) and 45 m l of Platinum PCR SuperMix ( Invitrogen ) . PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 1 min at 95 (cid:3) ; 30 cycles of 1 min at Drosophila lqf Overexpression Screen 1165 95 (cid:3) / 1 min at 50 (cid:3) / 1 min 40 sec at 72 (cid:3) ; 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 (cid:3) . PCR products were puriﬁed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the QIAquick Gel extraction kit ( QIAGEN , Chatsworth , CA ) . Four PCR primer pairs were used to amplify the aux gene in four overlapping parts : 5 9 - AGCAAACTGATTCCGCTCCAC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GCATTGTTTGTTCTGAAGCAGTCC - 3 9 ; 5 9 - TTGTCGC CTTTGTGGGTTCCAG - 3 9 and 5 9 - TAAACTCGCAGGACCCAA GCACTG - 3 9 ; 5 9 - AAGTGGATGTCTCTTGCCGACG - 3 9 and 5 9 - TG TGCCCGAACTTTTGGTG - 3 9 ; 5 9 - agcacgctaagtggaaagtctccc - 3 9 and 5 9 - acagggataccaatgagtcacagag - 3 9 . The same primers were used for automated ﬂuorimetric DNA sequencing , and also an additional primer was used for the longest template : 5 9 - TTT CACGCCCGCAAAGGAATGG - 3 9 . The Rala allele in EE1 mutants was ampliﬁed by PCR from one adult male ﬂy . The template was prepared as described above . PCRconditionswere1cycle1min at90 (cid:3) ; 30 cycles1minat95 (cid:3) / 1 min at 55 (cid:3) / 1 min at 72 (cid:3) ; 1 cycle 10 min at 72 (cid:3) . Four primer pairs were used for both PCR and DNA sequencing : 5 9 - CTGTGAGCC GACTCCATAAGTTG - 3 9 and 5 9 - CCTGAGAGGAAAGCAAAAC GC - 3 9 ; 5 9 - GCTACTTCGTTGCCATAACTCCC - 3 9 and 5 9 - TCCA GTGATGTTCTCGTTCGTAAG - 3 9 ; 5 9 - ATGTTGGTTCGGTCCT TG - 3 9 and 5 9 - CTGAAATGCTGCTGTGAAA - 3 9 ; 5 9 - TGACGGTTC TCTGGTGAATAAAGG - 3 9 and 5 9 - CGTCTGTGTGCTTTTCGC TTG - 3 9 . Mutations found in aux or Rala alleles were conﬁrmed by repeating the PCR and sequencing reactions . Analysis of eye and wing morphology : Scanning electron micro - graphy and plastic sectioning of adult eyes were as described in H uang et al . ( 1995 ) . Eye disc immunohistochemistry was as described in O verstreet et al . ( 2004 ) . Wings were mounted as described in C adavid et al . ( 2000 ) . Light photomicrographs of eyes was with an Olympus SZX12 microscope and a Kodak DC120 digital camera . Wings and eye sections were photo - graphed with a Zeiss Axioplan and Axiocam HRc . Immuno - stained eye discs were photographed with a Leica TCSSP2 confocal microscope . Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 was used for pro - cessing images . RESULTS Overexpression of lqf 1 in the eye by a glrs - lqf trans - gene : A glrs - lqf transgene that expresses lqf 1 speciﬁcally in the eye disc was constructed ( Figure 1O ) . The glrs ex - pression vector ( H uang and F ischer - V ize 1996 ) , which is nearly identical to the more widely used GMR vector ( H ay et al . 1994 ) , activates gene expression in all cells of the third instar larval eye disc three to four rows posterior to the morphogenetic furrow . By mobilizing a primary transformant line , many independent glrs - lqf lines were generated to obtain one with a strong rough - eye phenotype ( Figure 1 , A and D ) . Overexpression of a wild - type lqf gene results in a mutant phenotype most likely because Lqf is performing its normal function too efﬁciently and / or because Lqf is titrating from the cell proteins with which it forms complexes . The idea be - hind the modiﬁer screen is that lowering by half ( in heterozygous mutants ) the dose of proteins that Lqf re - quires to function , or that Lqf binds , will modify the rough - eye phenotype . As ﬂies with two copies of the transgene ( 2X glrs - lqf ) have a much rougher eye than ﬂies with one copy ( 1X glrs - lqf ) ( Figure 1 , D and H ) , the rough eye is lqf 1 dosage sensitive and therefore likely is also responsive to changes in the dosage of other genes F igure 1 . —The glrs - lqf eye phenotype . Scanning electon micrographs ( A , D , H , K ) and tangential sections ( B , C , E – G , I , J , L – N ) of adult eyes are shown . The genotypes are ( A – C ) wild type ( wt ) ; ( D – G ) 1Xglrs - lqf ; ( H – J ) 2Xglrs - lqf ; and ( K – N ) 2Xglrs - lqf ; 727 / 1 . The boxes in B , E , I , and L corre - spond to the enlargements in C , F , G , J , and M – N , respectively . The numbers in C refer to R - cells . In F and G , asterisks indi - cate ectopic R - cells and arrows indicate degenerated R7’s . The plus signs in J indicate R - cells . The 2Xglrs - lqf eyes are homo - zygous for the 1Xglrs - lqf P element . The rough - eye phenotype of 2Xglrs - lqf is unlikely to be affected by a mutation caused by the P element insertion because ﬂies with one copy of this P element and an additional copy at a different location show similarly rough eyes . In eyes with 1X glrs - lqf , some facets have more than the normal number of six outer R - cells ( B , C , and E – G ) . Adult eyes with 2X glrs - lqf have more severely disrupted eye morphology ; organized facets are absent , although some R - cells do form ( I and J ) . Also , degeneration of R7 is observed in glrs - lqf transformants ( B , C , and E – G ) .

H . Eun et al . that interact with lqf 1 . To test this idea , we used muta - tions in the chc gene , as it encodes a protein that we know that Lqf binds ( D rake et al . 2000 ) and likely also requires for its function . We found that two differ - ent chc mutations ( chc 1 and chc 4 ) are strong dominant enhancers of 1Xglrs - lqf ( data not shown ; see below ) . This result suggests that a screen for dominant enhancers of the 1Xglrs - lqf rough eye should identify genes encoding proteins that interact with Lqf . As chc mutants act as enhancers rather than as sup - pressors , the Lqf overexpression phenotype is likely due , at least in part , to Lqf sequestering proteins such as clathrin , rendering them unavailable for other func - tions . If the 1Xglrs - lqf mutant eye were due to Lqf hyper - activity , then lowering the clathrin levels by removing one chc 1 gene copy should decrease the ability of Lqf to function and thus suppress the mutant eye phenotype . In contrast , what is observed is that in a 1Xglrs - lqf back - ground , where the mutant eye is due in part to depletion of the pool of free clathrin , further lowering of the clathrin levels by mutation of one copy of the chc 1 gene exacerbates the clathrin depletion problem and thus also the mutant eye phenotype . Screens for dominant enhancers of the glrs - lqf eye phenotype : Separate screens were performed for domi - nant enhancers of the 1Xglrs - lqf rough eye on the auto - somes or the X chromosome . ( The 1Xglrs - lqf rough eye is too weak to screen reliably for suppressors . ) Approx - imately 30 , 000 F 1 males were screened for autosomal enhancers ( Figure 2 ) ; 16 chromosome 2 - linked mutants and 74 chromosome 3 - linked mutants were recovered . An example of an enhanced eye phenotype is shown in Figure 1 , K – N . The ﬁrst goal in analyzing the autosomal enhancers was to sort them into complementation groups by per - forming pairwise crosses of all of the mutants on each chromosome . When knocked out , most Drosophila genes will not result in an obvious mutant phenotype or lethality and are considered redundant genes ( A dams et al . 2000 ) . Thus , we expected that most of the en - hancers that we identiﬁed were not likely to result in a homozygous mutant phenotype and therefore , even though they are probably multiple mutant alleles of several genes , would not sort into complementation groups in the cross matrix . Although these redundant genes may be interesting factors in Lqf function , as the mutants have phenotypes only in a glrs - lqf background , the genes are difﬁcult to identify and their functions are difﬁcult to study . For this reason , we decided to pursue only the genes corresponding to the complementation groups that we could identify in our matrix . Thus , we tested each enhancer - containing chromosome for ho - mozygous phenotypes ( morphology or lethality ) in an otherwise wild - type background . Only those enhancers on chromosomes that result in a mutant phenotype when homozygous were entered into the matrix . If the homozygous mutant phenotype is due to the enhancer rather than to an unrelated EMS - induced mutation , then multiple alleles are likely to be identiﬁed in the com - plementation matrix . We found that 13 of the 16 enhancers on chromo - some 2 and 31 of the 74 enhancers on chromosome 3 were on homozygous lethal chromosomes and these enhancer mutants were used in the complementa - tion matrices . Also included in the chromosome 3 complementation analysis was one homozygous viable F igure 2 . —Mutagenesis screen for autosomal enhancers of the glrs - lqf eye phenotype . A cross scheme is shown for the screen of the autosomes for dominant enhancers of the glrs - lqf rough eye . See materials and methods for information about ﬂy strains . Drosophila lqf Overexpression Screen 1167 enhancer chromosome ( L7 ) where the homozygotes , in an otherwise wild - type background , initially appeared to have slightly rough eyes . The result was that one com - plementation group containing 12 mutants was identi - ﬁed among the chromosome 2 enhancers , and one complementation group containing 12 enhancers was identiﬁed among the chromosome 3 enhancers ( Figure 3 ) . As there are 12 members of each lethal complemen - tation group , it is likely that we would have isolated at least two alleles of most essential autosomal genes that enhance glrs - lqf . Thus , we reason that the lethal chro - mosomes that complement every other enhancer chro - mosome in the matrices most likely contain at least two mutations : an enhancer mutation in a nonessential gene and an unrelated EMS - induced homozygous lethal mutation . Approximately 15 , 000 F 1 females were screened for X - linked enhancers ( Figure 4 ) and eight mutants were identiﬁed . Of these eight mutant chromosomes , two were homozygous lethal ( AA1 and BB2 ) , one was hemi - zygous viable with morphological phenotypes and male sterility ( EE1 ) , and ﬁve were homozygous viable with no obvious mutant phenotypes . As it is impossible to per - form complementation crosses with the X - linked lethals ( adult males are unobtainable ) , we determined whether or not AA1 , BB2 , and EE1 are allelic in a different man - ner ( see below ) . Identiﬁcation of the chromosome 2 complementation group as split ends : By meiotic recombination analysis using a multiply marked second chromosome , the enhancer C18 , as a representative of the complementa - tion group on chromosome 2 , was localized close to aristaless ( al ) at polytene position 21C3 ( materials and methods ) .

The glrs - lqf enhancers sort into three lethal complementation groups corresponding to the genes chc , spen , and aux . In ad - dition , a single viable mutant allele of Rala was identiﬁed . Lines represent chromosomes , and the solid boxes centro - meres . Numbers beneath the lines are polytene bands . Boxed numbers and letters are allele names .

Eun et al . of the deﬁciencies localized C18 to an area that includes 12 genes ( materials and methods ) . Among them , spen was identiﬁed as a candidate for C18 because it is the largest gene in the region , amorphic spen alleles are homozygous lethal , spen is known to play a role in Notch signaling ( K uang et al . 2000 ) , and spen was the only gene in the region for which mutant alleles were available . The C18 chromosome failed to complement three homo - zygous lethal spen alleles ( spen 14O1 , spen 16H1 , and spen 03350 ) or Df ( 2L ) net - PM47C , which deletes spen ( materials and methods ) . Also , the other 11 members of the C18 com - plementation group were tested for complementation by spen 14O1 and Df ( 2L ) net - PM47C . In trans to spen 14O1 , the three alleles C18 , N28 , and I55 are completely lethal , while the other eight alleles produce viable escapers ( 0 . 5 – 10 % of progeny ) with no notable morphological phenotypes . ( Similarly , the alleles N18 , L13 , and L19 in heterozygous combinations with each other produce normal - appearing escapers . ) By contrast , every allele in the C18 complementation group is lethal in trans to Df ( 2L ) net - PM47C . We conclude that the C18 comple - mentation group is spen and that at least eight of the alleles are hypomorphic . Identiﬁcation of the chromosome 3 complementa - tion group as auxilin : By meiotic recombination with a multiply marked third chromosome , enhancer 727 , a representative of the chromosome 3 complementation group , was localized between thread ( th ) and curled ( cu ) ( materials and methods ) . Readily available deﬁciency chromosomes in polytene chromosome region 72C – 86D ( materials and methods ) all complement the le - thality of enhancer 727 , but there were several gaps in the coverage of the region . Male recombination map - ping of 727 with four P elements at polytene positions 78A , 80A , 82B , and 84B ( materials and methods ) localized 727 within 80A – 82B , a region including the centromere not uncovered by any of the deﬁciencies that we used . Another round of male recombination mapping with nine P elements within 80A – 82B ( materials and methods ) localized 727 to a region within 82A that includes eight genes ( CG12581 – CG181430 ) ( G rumbling et al . 2006 ) . Among the eight genes , auxilin ( aux ) was chosen as a candidate because in vitro and in other organ - isms , Auxilin is involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( P rasad et al . 1993 ; H oning et al . 1994 ; U ngewickell etal . 1995 ; H olstein etal . 1996 ; G all etal . 2000 ; P ishvaee et al . 2000 ; U meda et al . 2000 ; G reener et al . 2001 ; L emmon et al . 2001 ) . As there were no existing aux mu - tant alleles to use for complementation tests , we tested 727 / D136 heterozygotes ( a lethal combination ) for com - plementation with Act5C - gal4 . UAS - aux transgenes and with a genomic aux 1 transgene ( materials and meth - ods ) . Either the aux 1 cDNA or the genomic DNA was sufﬁcient for complete rescue of all 727 / D136 pheno - types ( data not shown ) . We also determined the DNA sequences of the aux genes present on each enhancer - containing third chromosome within the 727 comple - mentation group . Nonsense or missense mutations were found in the aux open reading frame in 11 of the 12 enhancer chromosomes ( Figure 5 ) . We conclude that the 727 complementation group is aux . Identiﬁcation of the genes corresponding to the X - linked complementation groups : As we already knew that X - linked chc mutations are lethal when amorphic ( B azinet et al . 1993 ) and are dominant enhancers of glrs - lqf rough eyes ( see above ) , we tested whether AA1 , BB2 , or EE1 were chc mutants . We asked if a P element containing chc 1 genomic DNA that rescues amorphic chc mutants , or if Dp ( 1 ; Y ) shi 1 y 1 B S , a Y chromosome containing a duplication of X that includes chc 1 , would complement any of the three enhancers ( materials and methods ) . We found that AA1 and BB2 were F igure 5 . —Molecular analysis of aux mutant alleles . The Drosophila Auxilin protein is dia - grammed ; numbers are amino acids 1 – 1165 . Ar - rows indicate approximate positions of the codon changes in each mutant allele . The table shows each nucleotide change and the corre - spondingcodonchanges . Thefunctionaldomains of Drosophila Auxilin were inferred by amino acid sequence similarity to vertebrate Auxilin 2 , also known as GAK ( cyclin G - a ssociated k inase ) ( A hle and U ngewickell 1990 ; U ngewickell et al . 1995 ; K anaoka et al . 1997 ; K imura et al . 1997 ; G reener et al . 2000 ; U meda et al . 2000 ) . Vertebrates also have Auxilin 1 , which is neural speciﬁc and lacks the kinase domain ( P rasad etal . 1993 ; U ngewickell etal . 1995 ) . Drosophila have the single Auxilin 2 - like protein shown . Auxilin binds clathrin ( H olstein et al . 1996 ; G reener et al . 2000 ) and through its DnaJ do - main binds Hsc70 ( U ngewickell et al . 1995 ; H olstein etal . 1996 ) . Theaminoacid ( C 671 ) mu - tated in allele K47 is not conserved in vertebrate GAK , butP 1111 , whichismutatedinallele L7 , isconservedinGAKandinAuxilin1from Caenorhabditiselegans andyeast ( G all etal . 2000 ; P ishvaee et al . 2000 ; G reener et al . 2001 ) . Drosophila lqf Overexpression Screen 1169 complemented completely in both cases , while EE1 was not . We conclude that AA1 and BB2 are chc mutants . Enhancer EE1 was mapped physically by testing 27 stocks that constitute the X chromosome duplication kit from Bloomington and , subsequently , 11 deﬁciency chromosomes for complementation of EE1 ( materials and methods ) . Taken together , the duplication and deﬁciency data implicated only a few genes , including Rala ( materials and methods ) . We considered Rala as a candidate for EE1 because some of the phenotypes reported for overexpression of a dominant - negative Rala transgene ( S awamoto et al . 1999 ) are similar to some of the EE1 phenotypes ( re - duced rough eyes and missing bristles and hairs ; Figure 6 ) and because Rala encodes a small Ras - like GTPase that regulates vesicle trafﬁcking ( reviewed in F eig 2003 ) . ( In vertebrates , there are two Ral proteins , Rala and Ralb ; in Drosophila , there is only one and although it has been also referred to as DRal in the literature , here we use the gene name on FlyBase , Rala . ) Expression of a wild - type Rala cDNA ( Act5C - gal4 ; UAS - Rala ) comple - ments the morphological phenotypes of EE1 . We de - termined the DNA sequence of the Rala allele on the EE1 X chromosome and found a missense mutation : Ser 154 ( TCG ) is mutated to Leu 154 ( TTG ) . Ser 154 is con - served in human Ral proteins and also in human Kras , and amino acids 152 – 156 are required for nucleotide binding ( S awamoto et al . 1999 ) . We conclude that EE1 is a mutant allele of Rala . aux mutants represent an allelic series : The two mis - sense mutants , aux K47 and aux L7 , are clearly weaker than any of the nonsense mutants or aux F37 ; at 25 (cid:3) , aux L7 ho - mozygotes and aux L7 / aux K47 heterozygotes are viable , while all of the nonsense mutants are homozygous lethal and lethal in heterozygous combinations with each other . By observing the eye phenotypes of missense / nonsense mutant escapers , we ﬁnd that aux K47 is a stronger mutant than aux L7 ( Figure 7 ) , and we also ordered the nonsense mutants into an allelic series ( data not shown ) . From F igure 6 . — Rala EE1 morphological phenotypes . External body parts of wild - type and Rala EE1 hemizygous males are shown .

( C – F ) Escapers with hetero - zygous combinations of weak and strong aux alleles have rough external eyes with eye - patterning defects typical of Notch pathway mutants : disorganized ommatidia , most with too many R - cells , some with too few , and some with fused om - matidia . aux K47 ( E and F ) has stronger effects in the eye than does aux L7 ( C and D ) . 1170 S . H . Eun et al . strongest to weakest , the allelic series is [ D128 , 727 ] , [ K5 , L24 ] , [ K48 , D136 , C2 , J26 , F37 ] , and N7 , K47 , L7 . Although the variability of wing phenotypes makes it difﬁcult to be certain , the positions of K47 and L7 in the allelic series may be reversed in the wing . aux L7 is cold sensitive . As described above , at 25 (cid:3) , het - erozygotes between aux L7 and any nonsense mutant are semiviable and escapers have mutant eyes and wings . By contrast , at 18 (cid:3) these same heterozygous combinations are completely lethal . aux hypomorphs resemble lqf hypomorphs : The eye and wing phenotypes of aux hypomorphic escapers re - semble those of lqf hypomorphs ( C adavid et al . 2000 ) . The eyes of aux hypomorphs are rough externally and each facet has more than the normal complement of eight R - cells ( Figure 7 ) ; the wings have extra vein ma - terial and are notched ( Figure 8 ) . spen and aux mutations are not dominant enhancers of hypomorphic lqf phenotypes : Because the enhancer screen was performed in a background where lqf is overexpressed in the eye , we were curious to know if the enhancer mutants that we isolated could also have been identiﬁed in a screen for enhancers of hypomorphic lqf mutations . We determined previously that the mutant phenotypes of lqf FDD9 homozygotes ( lqf FDD9 is hypomor - phic ) are strongly enhanced by chc loss - of - function mu - tants ( C adavid et al . 2000 ) . A weak chc allele dominantly enhances the eye and wing malformations in lqf FDD9 , while the dominantly enhanced phenotype caused by strong chc alleles is death . By contrast , none of the spen or aux alleles that we tested ( spen C18 , spen J47 , spen L13 , spen 14O1 , spen 16H1 and aux 727 , aux D136 , aux C2 , aux N7 , aux D128 , aux L7 , and aux F37 ) enhance lqf FDD9 notably ( data not shown ) . We conclude that neither spen nor aux mutants could have been isolated in a screen for enhancers of lqf FDD9 homozygous phenotypes . Genetic interactions between lqf and aux loss - of - function mutants : Although strong aux mutant alleles are not dominant enhancers of lqf FDD9 , amorphic lqf mutants ( lqf ARI ) are strong dominant enhancers of hy - pomorphic aux mutations . Flies hypomorphic for aux in these experiments were heterozygous for combinations of aux K47 or aux L7 , the two weakest mutant alleles , and each stronger aux allele . As described above , these com - binations of aux alleles are semilethal at 25 (cid:3) and pro - duce escapers with mutant eyes and wings . In contrast , the heterozygous combination of an aux K47 lqf ARI or an aux L7 lqf ARI chromosome with any aux allele is lethal with no escapers , except for aux N7 , aux L7 , and aux K47 , which did give escapers . In these escapers , the rough - eye phe - notype is enhanced only slightly , and the wing phe - notype is enhanced severely ( Figure 9 and data not shown ) . DISCUSSION In a mutagenesis screen of the entire Drosophila genome , we identiﬁed mutations in four essential genes as enhancers of the mutant eye phenotype resulting from lqf 1 overexpression : chc , Rala , spen , and aux . While F igure 8 . —Wing phenotypes of aux hypomorphs . Wings of wild - type ( wt ) ﬂies ( A ) , aux L7 homozygotes ( B ) , or escapers ( C – E ) with the genotypes indicated are shown .

( A ) Wings heterozygous for aux L7 / aux K47 have a wild - type phenotype but are sensitive to the dose of lqf 1 activity . ( B ) Halving the normal lqf 1 gene dosage from two gene copies to one copy in an aux L7 / aux K47 back - ground results in wings with a strong Notch - pathway - like mu - tant phenotype . Drosophila lqf Overexpression Screen 1171 we expected to identify chc alleles in the screen , the other three loci were unexpected . We discuss below the implications of these genetic interactions for the role of Lqf in Notch signaling . A potential function for Rala in Notch signaling : The genetic interaction between Rala and lqf suggests the possibility that Rala GTPase might regulate Lqf - depen - dent Delta signaling through one of three mechanisms . First , Rala might regulate Lqf - dependent endocytosis . In vertebrate and Drosophila cultured cells , Ral , acting through the effector RalBP1 ( also called RLIP76 ) , reg - ulates endocytosis through the formation of a complex containing Epsin and the EH - domain protein POB - 1 ( J ullien - F lores et al . 2000 ; R osse et al . 2003 ) . Second , Rala could regulate endosome recycling . In verte - brate cells , also through the RalBP1 effector , Ral stimu - lates recycling through the related EH - protein REPS1 ( N akashima et al . 1999 ) . In Drosophila , there is a unique POB - 1 / REPS homolog encoded by an uncharacterized locus called CG6192 ( M irey et al . 2003 ) , which could participate in the regulation of Lqf - dependent Delta en - docytosis or in subsequent recycling of Delta - containing endosomes . Third , Rala might regulate actin organiza - tion that is critical for Delta internalization and sig - naling . In yeast , an Epsin complex containing RalBP1 and the GTPase Cdc42 organizes the actin cytoskeleton and cell polarity ( A guilar et al . 2006 ) . The function of Epsin is to stabilize Cdc42 d GTP and thereby link sites of endocytosis and cell polarity . In Drosophila , experi - ments using dominant - negative and constitutively active Rala transgenes led to the conclusion that Rala regulates actin cyoskeleton organization through the JNK path - way ( S awamoto et al . 1999 ) . However , it is not known if Drosophila Rala works through the RalBP1 homolog or Cdc42 . The genetic interaction between Rala and lqf may provide a critical clue to understanding why Lqf - dependent Delta internalization is required for Delta signaling . A role for Auxilin in Notch signaling : The identiﬁ - cation of aux mutants as genetic interactors with lqf provides another clue as to why Delta signaling requires Lqf - dependent Delta endocytosis . Auxilin functions in uncoating clathrin - coated vesicles ( L emmon et al . 2001 ) and also may play an earlier role in endocytosis in the internalization step at the plasma membrane ( N ew - myer et al . 2003 ; L ee et al . 2005 ) . In favor of the idea that aux 1 and lqf 1 functions are related , we have shown that aux loss - of - function mutations not only interact with glrs - lqf , but also interact with lqf loss - of - function muta - tions . Also , the phenotypes of aux hypomorphs de - scribed here and in H agedorn et al . ( 2006 ) are similar to those of lqf hypomorphs and are typical of Notch pathway mutants . Like lqf 1 , aux 1 is required in the signaling cells ( S . H . E un and J . A . F ischer , unpub - lished results ) . More experiments are required to de - termine what potential functions of Drosophila Auxilin ( internalization or uncoating ) are essential for Delta signaling . Moreover , it remains to be determined if , like Lqf ( Epsin ) , Auxilin plays a direct role in Delta signaling or if the vesicle - uncoating function of Auxilin is re - quired indirectly , for example , to maintain a pool of clathrin available for ligand internalization . The genetic interaction between spen and lqf suggests a nuclear role for Lqf : The identiﬁcation of spen alleles in this screen suggests the exciting possibility that Lqf may have an additional function in the nucleus . Spen is a conserved nuclear protein that regulates many differ - ent signaling pathways , including Notch ( D ickson et al . 1996 ; S taehling - H ampton et al . 1999 ; W iellette et al . 1999 ; C hen and R ebay 2000 ; K uang et al . 2000 ; L ane et al . 2000 ; P rokopenko et al . 2000 ; R ebay et al . 2000 ; T herrien et al . 2000 ; L in et al . 2003 ) . Spen is thought to function in the Notch signal - receiving cells by modulat - ing the levels of Suppressor of Hairless , a Notch effec - tor protein ( K uang et al . 2000 ) . As is typical of Notch pathway mutants , some ommatidia in spen mutant eyes have extra R - cells ( D ickson et al . 1996 ) . Vertebrate Epsin ( and other plasma - membrane - associated endocytic proteins ) shuttles between the cyto - plasm and the nucleus , and Epsin has been shown to bind the vertebrate transcription factor PLZF ( p romye - locytic l eukemia Z n ( 2 ) 1 f inger ) protein in a yeast two - hybrid screen ( H yman et al . 2000 ; V ecchi et al . 2001 ; B enmerah et al . 2003 ; B enmerah 2004 ) . However , it is unknown whether or not the Epsin / PLZF interaction is physiologically relevant . It is striking that Spen , a nuclear protein , is one of only four essential proteins in the ﬂy whose levels become limiting for proper eye development when Lqf is over - expressed . No other known Notch pathway genes were identiﬁed , not even those known to interact closely with lqf , for example , neuralized ( O verstreet et al . 2004 ) . [ As neuralized is on chromosome 3 and Neuralized protein is (cid:2) 60 % the size of Aux protein ( (cid:2) 700 and (cid:2) 1100 amino acids , respectively ) , the fact that we obtained 12 inde - pendent alleles of aux suggests strongly that we are likely to have identiﬁed at least two alleles of neuralized , were it possible . ] This suggests that the interaction between Lqf and Spen is close and thus that Lqf might function in the nucleus with Spen .
