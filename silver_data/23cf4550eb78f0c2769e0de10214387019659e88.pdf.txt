Computer - aided design ( CAD ) tools aim to assist designers in their professional work , one key aspect of which is devising , evaluating , and choosing among multiple design alternatives . Yet , with few and limited exceptions , current tools handle just a single design model at a time , forcing users to adopt various ad hoc tactics for handling multiple design alternatives . Despite considerable prior work , there are no general , effective strategies for supporting design alternatives . New tools are needed to develop such strategies : to learn how designers’ behavior change s with support for multiple alternatives . In this article , we describe CAMBRIA , a multi - state prototype tool we developed for working with multiple 2D parametric CAD models in parallel . We describe the outcomes of an analytical evaluation of CAMBRIA using the Cognitive Dimensions framework . Keywords : Computer - aided design • CAD • Parametric CAD • Interaction design
