Introduction Many biological processes depend on the ability of cells to sense and respond to the chemical as well as mechanical cues of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The differentiation of stem cells , for instance , is sensitive to matrix composition and rigidity [ 1 , 2 ] . Cell migration , which is important to a wide range of homeostatic processes , is modulated by ECM rigidity gradients in a process termed durotaxis [ 3 ] . The proliferation rates of many cell types are strongly influenced by the extent of their spread area which , in turn , depends on the chemical , mechanical and topographical properties of the extracellular environment [ 4 ] . The increased mechanical stress in fibrotic tissues is felt by resident cells that transdifferentiate into highly contractile myofibroblasts [ 5 ] , and the mechanical properties of healing scars , for example in skin or heart muscle , determine tissue function after injury [ 6 , 7 ] . Moreover , increased ECM stiffness drives the progression of certain tumors such as breast cancer [ 8 ] , and the inability of cells to properly sense their mechanical environment has been associated with a range of pathologies including muscular dystrophies or kidney malfunction [ 9 , 10 ] . The mechanisms by which cells detect and process mechanical information depend on the nature of the mechanical signal and the subcellular structures transmitting it . Mechanosensitive ion - channels , for instance , detect changes in plasma membrane tension [ 11 , 12 ] , whereas cadherin - based adherens junctions transduce intercellular stresses [ 13 ] . By contrast , the chemical composition and mechanical properties of the ECM are sensed by integrin - associated , multi - molecular complexes called focal adhesions ( FAs ) , and a conceptual understanding of FA function has been developed [ 14 , 15 ] . However , given the complex nature of the ECM [ 16 ] , it appears increasingly important to consider the molecular complexity of FAs as well [ 17 – 22 ] . To aid this process , we here discuss the inner life of these enigmatic subcellular adhesion structures in more detail . The architecture of focal adhesions FAs display a complex , 3 - dimensional organization with vertically and horizontally arranged substructures ( Fig . 1 ) . The vertical layers consist of an outer FA layer MATBIO - 1336 ; No . of pages : 11 ; 4C : 0022 - 2836 / © 2017 The Authors . Published by Elsevier B . V .

The horizontal layering facilitates the compartmental - ization into distinct integrin subtype - dependent regions with different mechano - chemical characteristics ( Fig . 1B , C ) . One fascinating challenge of today ' s cell adhesion research is to elucidate how the organization and dynamics of these individual FA layers are regulated . The outer FA layer – ECM - specific anchorage by integrin receptors The outer FA layer contains the integrin receptors . Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that physically connect cells to a wide range of ECM proteins including fibronectin ( FN ) , vitronectin , col - lagens and laminins but also to other cell surface receptors like VCAM and ICAM [ 23 ] . Mammals can express 18 α - and 8 β - integrin subunits to form 24 functionally distinct receptors , and it is clear that many , if not all , integrin subtypes have specific , non - redundant properties [ 23 – 25 ] . As a result , the integrin expression signature determines how FAs assemble , chemical signals are processed and mechanical information is propagated . Cells adher - ing to collagen type I by integrin α 2 β 1 , for instance , induce a very different signaling response as compared to cells binding collagen type IV with outer FA layer > 20 integrin receptors inner FA layer f - actin network intermediate FA layer hundreds of proteins chemicalsignaling FAKLIMK1PAK mechanical signaling talinactininp130Cas anchorage A Src Axl ROR2 ECM F Vertical Layering B FA pY - FAK pY - paxillin β 3 integrin β 3 α v β 1 α 5 Fibronectin fibrillogenesis strong chemical signaling weak chemical signaling chemical signalling FB tensin α 5 integrinFN Horizontal Layering C mechanical coupling FA belt LiprinKankTalin FA core PaxillinVinculinTalin ? β 1 β 1 β 3 β 3 high forces low forces α v α v α 5 α 5 Fig . 1 . A vertical ( A ) and a horizontal ( B , C ) layering characterize the architecture of FAs . ( A ) Vertical layering . The outer FA layer , in which integrin receptors bind to extracellular ligands , provides anchorage to the ECM ; depending on the expressed integrin receptor subtypes , distinct mechano - chemical signaling networks are activat - ed . The intermediate FA layer comprises hundreds of proteins that respond to mechanical stimuli ( e . g . talin , actinin or p130Cas ) or mediate chemical signaling ( e . g . FAK , LIMK1 or PAK ) . The crosstalk between FA ' s mechanical and chemical signaling is , at least to some extent , mediated by tyrosine kinase such as ROR2 , Axl and Src . The inner FA layer merges into the actomyosin network , but also acts as a mechanosensitive module during cell adhesion . ( B ) . Horizontal layering – fibrillar adhesions ( FBs ) . The formation of FBs occurs on pliable FN - rich matrices and coincides with FN fibrillogenesis . While α v β 3 integrin receptors and tyrosine - phosphorylated ( pY ) proteins reside in the FA core , FBs are enriched in α 5 β 1 integrin and tensin . Since FBs display very low levels of tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins as compared to FAs , their chemical signaling is likely to be different . ( C ) . Horizontal layering – the FA belt . This type of horizontal layering is characterized by an accumulation of Kank family of proteins around mature FAs . As Kank proteins blunt integrin force transduction by partially uncoupling talin from f - actin , integrin receptors in the FA belt connect less efficiently to the actomyosin cytoskeleton . In addition , Kank associates with Liprins leading to the formation of cortical microtubule stabilization complexes ( not illustrat - ed ) that regulate FA turnover . Why Kank proteins are excluded from the FA core remains to be investigated . 2 Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix Please cite this article as : P . Ringer , et al . , Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix , Matrix Biol ( 2017 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . matbio . 2017 . 03 . 004 α 1 β 1 integrin [ 26 , 27 ] . Even similar integrins like the FN - receptors α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 induce adhesion structures with different molecular composition and signaling characteristics [ 28 ] . In addition , most cells express various integrin receptor subtypes that may synergize , for example to amplify myosin - dependent signal transduction cascades [ 28 ] . Integrin - receptor specificity becomes even more apparent when applying mechanical loads to distinct ECM – receptor linkages . While collagen - bound α 2 β 1 integrins appear to withstand me - chanical forces of more than 100 piconewton ( pN ) [ 29 ] , FN – α 5 β 1 bonds are likely to break at around 30 – 50 pN [ 30 ] , whereas α v β 3 integrins are thought to rupture at even lower forces [ 31 , 32 ] . Interest - ingly , α 5 β 1 integrin receptors display a so - called ‘ catch - slip bond ’ behavior characterized by a transient increase in the FN - bond lifetime between 10 – 30 pN ( Fig . 2C ) . How many integrin receptors display this rather unusual behavior ( i . e . tighter ECM – integrin binding under force ) remains to be investigated , but it appears that such catch bond properties are specific to distinct ECM – integrin interactions . Experiments on the fibrinogen – α II β 3 linkage , for instance , revealed reduced bond lifetimes when pulling forces were increased from 5 – 50 pN , which is characteristic for a classical slip bond linkage [ 33 ] . Together , the available data suggest that the integrin receptor subtypes present in the outer FA layer critically determine how chemical signals and mechanical forces are processed during cell adhe - sion . Even though morphologically similar , FAs of different cell types may be functionally very dissimilar depending on the set of expressed integrin receptors . The intermediate FA layer – coupling mechan - ical and chemical signaling Integrins , with the exception of the hemidesmoso - mal β 4 integrin [ 34 ] , are characterized by short strongsignaling F mechanical reinforcement A strong integrin - ECM binding conformation change talin unfolding myosin II activated FA recruitment vinculin LIM proteins enzyme activation p - FAK p - Src , p - Cas Stiff ECM weak signaling F no mechanical reinforcement B low myosin activity little enzymatic activation no FA recruitment reinforcement no conformationchange weak integrin - ECM binding Soft ECM C FA spring constant k FA : order of pN / nm catch bond regime FN - α 5 β 1 : 10 – 30 pN stiff ECM ( muscle ) ~ 10000 pN / μ m 2 soft ECM ( brain ) 100 – 1000 pN / μ m 2 f - actin elasticity 1 – 100 pN / μ m 2 catch bond FN - α 5 β 1 slip bond Fibrinogen - α II β 3 = phosphorylation Mechanical parameters of cell adhesion Mechano - chemical coupling in FAs Fig . 2 . FAs couple chemical and mechanical signaling . ( A ) Stiff ECM . Cells adhering to rigid matrices enforce their FAs under load through mechano - chemical feedback mechanisms . For instance , high mechanical tension across integrin receptors leads to partial talin unfolding and subsequent vinculin recruitment ; also LIM domain proteins are recruited to FAs in response to mechanical tension but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear [ 17 ] . Mechanical force may also activate FA - resident kinases that amplify chemical signaling in FAs through protein phosphorylation [ 49 ] . Modulation of RhoGTPase signaling pathways leads to increased actomyosin con - tractility and stress fiber formation . ( B ) FAs in cells on soft matrices may not experience high enough stresses to activate force - sensitive proteins that , as a result , remain insensitive to chemical signals . ( C ) . Typical mechanical parameters of cell - matrix adhesions . The elastic modules of the extracellular matrix typically ranges from hundreds – thousands of pN / μ m 2 ; the actomyosin network is compa - rably soft [ 120 ] . Typically , FA spring constants are modelled in the order of tens of pN / nm [ 121 ] . Force of 10 – 30 pN increase the lifetime of the α 5 β 1 – FN linkage [ 30 ] , whereas the fibrinogen – α v β 3 bond displays slip bond characteristics [ 33 ] . 3 Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix Please cite this article as : P . Ringer , et al . , Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix , Matrix Biol ( 2017 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . matbio . 2017 . 03 . 004 cytoplasmic tails of 13 – 70 amino acids that have neither enzymatic activity nor binding sites to directly associate with the actomyosin cytoskeleton [ 35 ] . Instead , intracellular proteins assemble at the cytoplasmic tails leading to integrin clustering and the formation of the second FA layer , where most of the chemical and mechanical signals are integrated . Crucial for the formation of the intermediate FA layer are the integrin regulators talin and kindlin both of which are required for inducing and then maintaining the active , ligand - binding competent state of integrins [ 36 ] . Talin comprises three f - actin and eleven vinculin - binding sites and mediates one of the first mechanical connections to the actomyo - sin network [ 37 ] . Interestingly , a similar f - actin binding function of kindlin - 2 has been recently proposed [ 38 ] , but it remains to be tested whether kindlin can bear mechanical forces during cell adhesion . Other important integrin interactors are the f - actin binding proteins filamin , α - actinin and tensin , the adaptor protein paxillin and focal adhe - sion kinase ( FAK ) [ 39 ] , but also integrin inactivators like ICAP1 [ 40 ] or the recently described pan - integrin inactivator SHARPIN [ 24 , 41 ] . These integrin - binding proteins engage further cytoplasmic molecules such as the ternary ILK - PINCH - Parvin ( IPP ) complex , actin - binding proteins like vinculin [ 42 ] , as well as protein kinases , phosphatases , and other protein modifying enzymes to form the adhesome compris - ing hundreds of distinct proteins [ 17 , 18 ] . How these individual FA components associate in space and time to transduce mechanical and chemical infor - mation in the dynamic context of a living cell has remained poorly understood . Yet , it is believed that chemical and mechanical signals synergize to enforce distinct signal trans - duction pathways ( Fig . 2 ) . Tension across the integrin activator talin , for example , leads to the exposure of cryptic vinculin binding sites and enhanced recruitment of vinculin [ 43 , 44 ] that then becomes phosphorylated [ 45 , 46 ] . Likewise , me - chanical tension across the adaptor protein p130Cas promotes phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues by Src family kinases [ 47 ] . Since many proteins are recruited to FAs in a force - dependent manner – numerous LIM - domain con - taining proteins localize to FAs only when cell adhesion forces are high [ 17 , 18 , 48 ] – it is likely that other proteins are regulated in a similar fashion . Furthermore , the catalytic activities of certain FA components are thought to be modulated by a mechanical allosterism ; the enzymatic activity of Src , for instance , rapidly increases upon mechanical stimulation [ 49 ] . As other tyrosine kinases like Axl and ROR2 are critical for FA - mediated ECM rigidity sensing [ 50 , 51 ] , it is clear that this class of enzymes plays a key role in FAs ' mechano - chemical regulation . In addition , many growth factors induce pathways that modulate FA - resident tyrosine kinases such as FAK [ 52 ] ; therefore , these enzymes are also key to the integration of FA - and growth factor - dependent signaling cascades during cell adhesion . The inner FA layer – force generation and mechanosensing The actomyosin network dominates the inner FA layer that does not only generate mechanical forces but also senses mechanical and chemical stimuli . For instance , the stability of the actin – myosin bond is sensitive to applied mechanical loads [ 53 , 54 ] , and the probability of f - actin to be severed by cofilin decreases when the filaments experiences mechan - ical tension [ 55 ] . In addition , growth factor receptor pathways modulate the actin cytoskeleton through controlling Rho - like GTPases [ 56 ] as well as non - muscle myosin II activity [ 57 ] , and certain GTPase - activating proteins seem to bind f - actin directly [ 58 ] . Thus , the actomyosin network acts as a mechanosensitive force generator in FAs [ 59 ] . The function of this innermost FA layer is dominated by the inherently dynamic nature of the actomyosin network , which is regulated in a spatially and temporally highly sensitive fashion [ 60 ] . While FAs in the lamellipodium of cells are exposed to a fast Arp2 / 3 - dependent retrograde flow of actin filaments , more centrally located adhesions connect to stress fibers that can be classified , according to their morphology and myosin content , into distinct elements such as dorsal and ventral stress fibers , transverse arcs and the perinuclear cap [ 61 ] . Moreover , cells can express different actin - and myosin - isoforms as well as a myriad of f - actin associated proteins , all of which affect actomyosin assembly and activity to very different extents [ 61 – 63 ] . Therefore , the organization and functional role of the inner FA layer is cell - type dependent and sensitive to the FA ' s subcellular location . The horizontal layering of FAs In addition to the vertical layering , FAs frequently undergo a horizontal segmentation ( Fig . 1B ) . The FN - binding integrin receptors α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 , for instance , segregate into distinct FA - substructures when adhering to pliable FN - rich surfaces . Under these conditions , α 5 β 1 integrins translocate from FAs into elongated fibrillar adhesions ( FBs ) , while α v β 3 integrin remains associated with the FA core [ 64 , 65 ] . In addition to the assembly of FN and the associated α 5 β 1 integrin receptor , FBs accumulate the actin - crosslinking protein tensin , which binds to the same NPxY motif in β - integrins like talin . Since NPxY phosphorylation impairs talin binding but does not affect the tensin – integrin interaction , this modi - fication may act as a molecular switch that regulates the horizontal compartmentalization of α v β 3 – talin 4 Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix Please cite this article as : P . Ringer , et al . , Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix , Matrix Biol ( 2017 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . matbio . 2017 . 03 . 004 and α 5 β 1 – tensin enriched adhesion domains [ 66 ] . Both compartments are likely to have very different biochemical properties , as FBs are devoid of tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins such as pY397 - FAK indicating rather weak or at least very different signaling activity [ 50 ] . In addition , FAs and FBs have different mechanical characteristics . Matured FBs are rather insensitive to myosin inhibition , whereas FA maintenance as well as FB formation strictly depend on actomyosin contractility [ 65 ] . Interestingly , the composition of FBs depends on whether cells are cultured in 2D or 3D environments [ 67 ] , and it has been recognized that distinct cell types express different tensin isoforms ( tensin - 1 , - 2 and - 3 ) displaying various degrees of FB enrich - ment [ 68 ] . Thus , FB formation and the physiological role of the FB – type of horizontal layering remains somewhat enigmatic and needs further investigation . Another form of horizontal layering has been identified in a morphologically distinct structure , called the FA belt ( Fig . 1C ) , which is characterized by the evolutionary conserved Kank proteins . Kank assembles in the immediate vicinity of FAs through talin - binding thereby promoting the active conforma - tion of talin and thus integrin activation [ 69 , 70 ] . In parallel , Kank impairs talin ' s ability to associate with f - actin and to transduce mechanical forces . As a result , adhesions surrounded by a FA - belt display reduced force transmission leading to FA sliding and slower cell migration [ 69 ] . Intriguingly , Kank proteins also associate with cortical microtubule stabilization complexes ( CMSC ) through liprins that recruit microtubule plus - end tracking proteins like CLASPs [ 71 ] . Since microtubule targeting coincides with FAs turnover [ 72 , 73 ] , this Kank - dependent type of horizontal layering is likely to play an important role in regulating FA stability through microtubule plus - end capture . Why Kank proteins bind to talin exclusively at the β 1 - rich FA border and not in the FA core is unclear . As the glycocalxy of cells facilitates the lateral organization of integrin receptors during cell adhe - sion [ 74 , 75 ] , it will be interesting to test whether the different types of horizontal layering within FAs are also glycocalyx - dependent . Towards a conceptual understanding of FA function Our current understanding of FA function is strongly influenced by the observation that cell adhesions can strengthen under mechanical loads [ 76 , 77 ] . Indeed , many cell types form large FAs on rigid substrates when cellular traction forces are high , while they display small FAs on soft matrices [ 77 , 78 ] . Similarly , inhibition of myosin activity usually reduces FA size , whereas the induction of intracel - lular contractility ( e . g . by activating RhoA ) stimulates FA growth . Consistent with these experiments , certain integrin receptors enforce their binding to extracellular ligands in response to mechanical tension [ 30 , 79 ] , and force - induced unfolding of molecules such as talin can increase the recruitment of other FA proteins like vinculin [ 43 ] . Together , these experiments have led to the concept that FAs act very much like elastic springs that enlarge and become enforced when mechanical tension in - creases , but remain small and short - lived when forces are low . In this model , the spring constant assigned to a FA determines the adhesion growth rate under force , which occurs only when the ECM is sufficiently rigid ( Fig . 2 ) ; on substrates that are significantly softer than the FA spring , adhesions do not enlarge because the ECM deforms and the spring does not stretch [ 80 , 81 ] . While this model correctly describes a large body of experimentation and provides an excellent framework for further theoretical approaches [ 81 – 83 ] , some data indicate that the molecular regula - tion of FAs is far more complex . First and most importantly , FAs do not always grow under force . In fact , the opposite – FA disassembly under mechan - ical load – frequently occurs during cell migration and is necessary for cells to move forward [ 84 ] . Second , small and short - lived FAs termed ‘ nascent adhesions ’ ( NAs ) at the lamellipodium of cells generate comparably high traction forces [ 85 ] , while large , centrally - located FAs often exert only low stresses [ 69 , 86 ] . Third , the cellular response to distinct matrix rigidities is integrin receptor subtype - dependent [ 28 ] and can be extracellularly ( e . g . by addition of hyaluronic acid ) [ 87 ] or intracellularly ( by affecting protein tyrosine kinase signaling ) modu - lated [ 50 ] . Finally , FAs display a heterogeneous substructure [ 88 , 89 ] and traction forces are often unevenly distributed below individual adhesion sites [ 21 , 86 ] . Thus , further experimentation and theoretical modelling is needed to comprehend FA function in cells . Experimental approaches to investigate FA function A number of recently developed technologies including mass - spectrometry methods and high - resolution microscopy techniques have revolu - tionized cell adhesion research . FAs ' molecular composition is analyzed with a depth and the individual components become visualized with a resolution that is mind - blowing and was considered unrealistic just a few years ago . In addition , a set of genetically modified cell lines to investigate molec - ular mechanisms has become available and Crispr - Cas9 approaches will likely complement this toolbox . In the following , we will discuss how some of 5 Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix Please cite this article as : P . Ringer , et al . , Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix , Matrix Biol ( 2017 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . matbio . 2017 . 03 . 004 these techniques may be utilized to evaluate the composition and function of the distinct FA layers . Probing the outer FA layer – how do distinct integrins propagate mechanical forces ? One of the open questions regarding the outer FA layer is how different integrin receptor subtypes govern FA function . The establishment of integrin - deficient cell lines , in which distinct receptor subtypes can be re - expressed and individually investigated , have been useful to study different FN - binding integrin receptors such as α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 [ 28 ] . An exciting alternative is the use of engineered surfaces to which only distinct FN - binding integrin receptor subtypes can bind [ 90 , 91 ] ; yet it seems important to extend these systems so that also other integrin receptors subtypes can be studied [ 92 ] . Similarly , it will be important to elucidate how distinct ECM – integrin interactions respond to ap - plied mechanical forces , for example by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) methods that revealed catch - bond behavior in FN – α 5 β 1 integrin linkages [ 30 , 79 ] . Unfortunately , a comparison with other integrin receptor types has been difficult because different experimental setups or loading rates – the speed at which mechanical forces are applied – were used [ 30 , 31 , 93 ] . It should be also noted that ECM – integrin linkages might be sensitive to the history of force application such as the FN – α 5 β 1 bond , which is strengthened by repeated applica - tions of mechanical forces [ 79 ] . Whether such a force - strengthening mechanism is a general feature of ECM – integrin linkages or specific to the FN – α 5 β 1 integrin bond will be important to determine . Direct evidence that the observed mechanical responses occur in the crowded environment of a living cell may be obtained by methods allowing force measure - ments across individual integrin - ligand bonds during cell adhesion [ 94 – 96 ] . Finally , super - resolution experiments have be - come indispensable to study the nanostructure of FAs ( Fig . 3 ) and the molecular dynamics of distinct integrin receptors in living cells . Single - protein tracking photo - activated localization microscopy was used to investigate the movement of individual integrin receptors molecules within and outside of FAs [ 97 ] . These experiments revealed a rather static behavior for β 3 integrin receptors , while β 1 integrins appeared more mobile during cell adhesion . Extend - ing such experiments to other integrin subunits should provide valuable insights into the integrin - subtype specific properties of FAs . Investigating the intermediate FA layer – how are mechano - chemical signals transduced ? The development of efficient mass spectrometry protocols has dramatically improved our understand - ing of the intermediate FA layer . Hundreds of proteins , many of which with yet unknown function , have been identified to associate with FAs [ 17 – 19 ] , and the development of high - throughput proteomics platforms should further facilitate testing how chem - ical signals are transduced within FAs in a force - dependent fashion [ 98 ] . An exciting perspec - tive is that the integration of various such data sets should provide important indications on the rele - vance and patho - physiological function of newly identified FA - associated molecules [ 99 , 100 ] . How - ever , establishing consistent protocols that permit meta - analyses will be key to those bioinformatics approaches . In parallel , various microscopy methods are currently being utilized to study FA structure and 3D organization with nanoscale resolution [ 20 , 22 , 101 ] . Molecular mechanics can be analyzed by FRET - based tension sensors [ 44 , 102 – 104 ] that f - actin vinculin merge confocal image high vinculin density low vinculin density zoom - in super - resolved image Fig . 3 . FA nano - scale organization . Super - resolution microscopy reveals that proteins display an uneven distribution in FAs . The mechanisms governing this complex spatio - temporal organization are still unclear . Here , we show a fibroblast adhering to a FN - coated glass coverslip stained for f - actin ; visualization of an expressed vinculin construct by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy reveals areas of high and low protein density . 6 Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix Please cite this article as : P . Ringer , et al . , Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix , Matrix Biol ( 2017 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . matbio . 2017 . 03 . 004 provided first insights into vinculin - and talin - dependent processes of FA force transduction [ 44 , 105 , 106 ] . Together , these microscopy ap - proaches revealed that FAs assemble in a much more dynamic and heterogeneous fashion than previously appreciated , and understanding how the observed FA substructures are spatio - temporally organized will be crucial . This is likely to require the further development of existing imaging techniques , for example to resolve intracellular force transduc - tion processes with single - molecule resolution in cells . Analyzing FAs ' inner layer – quantifying acto - myosin forces in cells The use of optical or magnetic tweezer techniques has been especially useful to study the mechanics of individual actin fibers and the actin - myosin linkage in vitro [ 53 – 55 ] . As distinct actin modulators and myosin isoforms regulate actomyosin function local - ly in cells [ 63 , 107 ] , it will become increasingly important to complement these studies with live cell experiments . Potentially useful methods include correlational fluorescence speckle microscopy to determine acto - myosin kinetics in cells [ 108 , 109 ] and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy as well as cryo - electron tomography to visualize and study distinct actin networks in situ [ 110 , 111 ] . Visualizing the mechanics of actomyosin networks in living cells , however , has remained challenging . A FRET - based actin tension sensor was described [ 112 ] , but its rather diffuse intracellular localization may complicate the extraction of mechanical param - eters with sufficient spatio - temporal resolution . Theoretical approaches to study FA function Many attempts to describe FA behavior theoretically are essentially captured by the original idea of Mitchison and Kirschner [ 113 ] , which describe FAs as mechanical clutches that engage with the actin retrograde flow in an ECM stiffness - dependent fashion . A stochastic simulation that considered ECM stiffness , load - and - fail - behavior of FA clutches and a force - velocity relationship of the actomyosin cytoskeleton predicted that cells tune their sensitivity towards distinct ECM rigidities by two distinguish - able mechanisms . For stiff substrates , the model predicted a ‘ frictional slippage ’ state in which individual FA springs quickly increase tension and then break before other clutches can be mechani - cally engaged leading to high retrograde flow rates with low traction forces . On soft substrates , the model assumed a ‘ load - and - fail ’ regime where FA springs disengage less frequently resulting in slower retrograde flow velocity , maximal traction forces but frequent failure of all clutches leading to traction force fluctuations [ 83 ] . Interestingly , these predic - tions are consistent with the behavior of neural growth cones , and force fluctuations have been observed in migrating fibroblasts [ 114 ] . However , many cell types are known to react differently to distinct ECM rigidities . Neurons , for instance , are easily cultured on soft substrates whereas astro - cytes do not spread on compliant surfaces and likely exert very little traction forces under these conditions [ 115 ] . Furthermore , distinct cell lines display maxi - mal migration speeds on substrates with different rigidities [ 116 ] . Thus , an updated version of the stochastic simulation suggested a second frictional slippage regime on soft substrates where FA clutches failed spontaneously before mechanical loads could build up [ 116 ] . This model made the intuitive prediction that cells adjust to different extracellular compliances by modulating the ‘ clutch ’ ( outer and intermediate FA layer ) and ‘ motor ’ parameters ( inner FA layer ) . An independent study predicted and experimen - tally observed myoepithelial cells adapting to distinct matrix rigidities by regulating their integrin expression profile and thus modulating integrin - ECM binding / unbinding rates [ 117 ] . Another model included tension - dependent reinforcement of the FA clutch ( through vinculin recruitment to partially unfolded talin molecules ) and successfully predict - ed the frequently observed behavior of cells to increase traction forces monotonically when ECM stiffness is elevated [ 118 ] . In the future , it will be fascinating to test how well these models predict the behavior of other FA subtypes . The recent identi - fication of the Kank family of proteins , which bind and activate talin but reduce force transduction in centrally located FAs , suggests are more complex scenario in mature adhesion structures [ 69 ] . Then again , the description of NAs , in which talin binds RIAM rather than vinculin [ 119 ] , may require a different set of parameters . Outlook Given the highly complex nature of cell - ECM adhesions that are dependent on the mechano - chemical nature of the extracellular substrate , the integrin expression profile and the composition of the intracellular FA layers , it seems unlikely that , for the time being , one unifying theoretical model will describe the versatile behavior of FAs . Instead , the fascinatingly complex biology of FAs will likely require a set of theoretical descriptions , which consider the molecular complexity of the horizontal and vertical FA layers in more detail . The development of new technologies and their application to physiologically relevant studies should allow the identification of those parameters worth implementing . 7 Sensing the mechano - chemical properties of the extracellular matrix Please cite this article as : P .
