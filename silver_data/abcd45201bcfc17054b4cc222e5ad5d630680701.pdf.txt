( A ) Following surface biotinylation with sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin , HeLa cell lysate was serially diluted with non - biotinylated control cell lysate , and the amount of labelling was detected using streptavidin - HRP after SDS - PAGE and blotting . Incubation with 100 mM MESNa prior to cell lysis was enough to remove more than 99 . 9 % of the initial signal . ( B ) Lysate from cells labelled with anti - CD59 antibody was serially diluted with non - labelled control cell lysate , and the amount of labelling was detected using an anti - mouse HRP antibody . Acid wash removed around 50 % of the initial surface signal . PI - PLC , which cleaves the GPI - anchor in CD59 , removed up to 90 % of the initial signal .

Control cells were kept at 4°C . After defined time for endocytosis , cells were rapidly returned to 4°C , and surface - exposed biotin was removed using the membrane impermeable reducing agent MESNa . Biotin label was detected using fluorescent streptavidin , after fixation and permeabilisa - tion .

The relative abundance of plasma membrane proteins in HeLa cells was calculated based on a previously published study ( Kulak et al . , 2014 ) . These are represented graphically ranked by abundance in blue , while proteins were detected in our experiments are shown in magenta . The data are listed in Figure 1—source data 1 .

Removal of extracellular fluorophore from BG - SS - fluorophore labelled SNAP - tag by reduction with MESNa is highly efficient . ( A ) Cells expressing SNAP - GPI were simultaneously labeled at 4°C with BG - SS - 488 and SNAPsurface549 . The latter is not reducible . They were then treated with PI - PLC or PI - PLC and then MESNa . Both treatments reduced the amount of label significantly ( top row of images ) . However when remaining cell surface label was inspected by adjusting the intensity post - acquisition ( lower panels ) , differential effects in the removal of the two fluorophores were observed . PI - PLC reduced the signal of both fluorophores evenly . However , when cells were treated with PI - PLC followed by MESNa the levels of reducible BG - SS - 488 become practically undetectable . ( B ) Quantification of images from the same experiment shown in A . Images used for quantification were confocal cross sections of cells . Line profiles across the plasma membrane of the cell were combined to produce average traces of fluorescence intensity . The removal of BG - SS - 488 in the MESNa + PI - PLC treated cells is clearly more efficient than removal of SNAP - surface549 .

Occasionally , cells contained larger endocytic structures ( > 0 . 5 µm ) that were intensely labeled with fluorescent streptavidin but did not contain transferrin , despite the presence of transferrin in the medium during incubation at 37°C .

Quantification of percent co - localisation . All processing was carried out in Image J . Two channel raw images were acquired by confocal microscopy . The channels were separated , subjected to Gaussian blur with σ = 0 . 7 , and then contrast adjusted using the histogram of pixel intensities as shown . In the streptavidin / biotin channel , the base of the histogram was used to set pixel intensity = 0 , maximal pixel intensity was not altered . In the transferrin channel , which is used to generate a binary mask , pixel intensity = 0 and maximal pixel intensity were both set to the base of the histogram of pixel intensities as shown . Following dilation of positive pixels in the binary mask a logical ‘AND’ operation was carried out to isolate those pixels in the streptavi - din channel that also are positive in the transferrin binary mask . This image was combined with the original biotin image in a two colour overlay , and manually drawn regions of interest were used to calculate total pixel intensity in the biotin channel , and total pixel intensity in the same channel from transferrin - positive pixels .

Bars 20 μ m . ( E ) Co - localisation between internalised SNAP - CD59 and transferrin in a cell expressing µ2 ( F174S / D176A ) - IRES - GFP . ( F ) Frequency distribution of CD59 cargo load within individual vesicles . Cells were labelled as in D . Vesicles were identified as objects in 3D reconstructions from confocal images with Imaris software using the transferrin signal . ( G ) As F , but displaying transferrin cargo load in the same population of vesicles . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 03970 . 027 Figure 8 . Continued Figure 8—figure supplement 1 . Reduction of AP - 2 ( alpha adaptin ) levels affects the amount of uptake of both transferrin and SNAP - CD59 , 50 hr after siRNA transfection . Cells stably expressing SNAP - CD59 were incubated at 37°C for 15 min with BG - SS - 549 and transferrin - 647 . Surface label was removed with MESNa and acid wash and then the cells were analysed by flow cytometry . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 03970 . 028 Cell biology Bitsikas et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e03970 .

Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the μ 2 YXX Φ - binding mutant - myc as shown . Cell lysates were subjected to immunopre - cipitation with anti - alpha adaptin , or as a negative control anti - GFP antibodies . Immunoprecipitates were analysed by Western blotting with anti - alpha adaptin and anti - myc antibodies . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 03970 . 029
