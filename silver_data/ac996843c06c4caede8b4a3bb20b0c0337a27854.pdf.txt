The latter is dependent on a reorganization of the host cytoskeleton ( actin / cortactin recruitment ) , whilst active penetration does not rely on the host’s cellular machinery . The ﬁrst obstacle for the fungus to reach deep tissues is the epithelial barrier and this interaction is crucial for commensal growth , fungal pathogenicity and host defense . This study aimed to characterize in vitro epithelial HeLa cell invasion by four different isolates of C . albicans with distinct clinical backgrounds , including a C . albicans SC5314 reference strain . All isolates invaded HeLa cells , recruited actin and cortactin , and induced the phosphorylation of both Src - family kinases ( SFK ) and cortactin . Curiously , L3881 isolated from blood culture of a patient exhibited the highest resistance to oxidative stress , although this isolate showed reduced hyphal length and displayed the lowest cell damage and invasion rates . Collectively , these data suggest that the ability of C . albicans to invade HeLa cells , and to reach and adapt to the host’s blood , including resistance to oxidative stress , may be independent of hyphal length . Keywords : Candida albicans , hyphae , HeLa cells , actin , cortactin , cell signaling INTRODUCTION Candida albicans is a polymorphic opportunistic human pathogen that takes on the most common morphologies of yeast , pseudohyphae , and true hyphae . All morphology types are found during infection ; however , hyphae are generally the invasive form of C . albicans ( Jacobsen et al . , 2012 ) . C . albicans frequently causes superﬁcial infections in mildly immunocompromised patients , but in severely immunocompromised or critically ill patients , this fungus may cause life - threatening , disseminated disease . The Candida genus is associated with approximately 80 % of nosocomial fungal infections , representing the major cause of fungemia showing a high mortality rate ( 40 – 60 % ) ( Perlroth et al . , 2007 ; Doi et al . , 2016 ) . Maza et al . C . albicans HeLa Cell Invasion and Signaling For most microbial pathogens , adherence to epithelial surfaces is the ﬁrst step to initiating an infection , and is even a prerequisite for their survival and eventual distribution . After attachment , many pathogens invade host cells ( Filler and Sheppard , 2006 ) . With regard to C . albicans , this fungus uses various mechanisms of pathogenicity : escape from host immune responses , morphological change ( yeast – to – hypha transition ) and invasion , which is supported by hyphae - associated factors such as adhesion molecules and the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes ( Wilson et al . , 2009 ) . In order to infect mucosal tissues , gain access to blood and subsequently escape from the bloodstream , C . albicans must interact with epithelial and endothelial cells ( Davis , 2009 ) . The invasion of non - professional phagocytic host cells by C . albicans can occur through two mechanisms : induced endocytosis and active penetration . The latter mechanism does not rely on the host’s cellular machinery , but possibly on physical pressure applied by the advancing hyphal tip and the secretion of extracellular hydrolases ( Wilson et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , invasion via induced endocytosis is dependent on host cell actin microﬁlament dynamics . C . albicans stimulates epithelial cells to produce pseudopodia - like structures that surround the fungus and cause its uptake . In endocytosis , induced proteases of C . albicans have little or no role ( Frank and Hostetter , 2007 ) . This highly eﬀective invasive mechanism is predominantly triggered by the interaction between a fungal adhesin ( Als3 ) ( Phan et al . , 2007 ) and either human E - cadherin or the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) on epithelial cells ( Zhu et al . , 2012 ) . Such interactions stimulate actin rearrangement in host cells and the subsequent internalization of fungal cells ( Phan et al . , 2007 ; Zhu et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , C . albicans exploits clathrin - dependent endocytosis , which requires dynamin and cortactin , to invade human epithelial cells ( Moreno - Ruiz et al . , 2009 ) . Cortactin is involved in actin - related cellular processes ranging from lamellipodium protrusion and extracellular matrix degradation to the uptake of intracellular pathogens such as bacteria and parasites ( Chen et al . , 2003 ; Bonﬁm - Melo et al . , 2015 ) . Cortactin interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex , newly formed actin ﬁlaments and a variety of actin - binding / regulation proteins ( Daly , 2004 ) ; it is also regulated by phosphorylation ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . Oral and vaginal epithelial cells recognize both the yeast and hyphal forms of C . albicans . As a consequence , they activate cellular signaling mechanisms , including mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated B cells ( NF - κ B ) , and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) pathways ( Moyes et al . , 2010 , 2014 , 2015 ; Naglik et al . , 2014 ) . With regard to induced endocytosis , our group has previously shown that extracellular amastigote ( EAs ) infective forms of Trypanosoma cruzi seem to share with C . albicans a similar pathway for entry into the host cell . Both events occur via an actin - dependent mechanism and involve cortactin ( Moreno - Ruiz et al . , 2009 ; Bonﬁm - Melo et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , T . cruzi recruited actin and cortactin to sites of adherence and invasion into HeLa cells and also selectively induced cortactin phosphorylation during cell invasion ( Bonﬁm - Melo et al . , 2015 ) . However , possible cortactin phosphorylation in response to C . albicans invasion into non - phagocytic cells , such as HeLa cells , has never been assessed . We propose that epithelial cells represent the ﬁrst obstacle for Candida invasion which probably will determinate the fate of this infection . We would like to consider invasion in a broad spectrum which includes crossing the endothelial barrier , reaching and adapting to blood . In this study , we veriﬁed the ability of diﬀerent Candida albicans isolates ( the reference strain SC5314 and three C . albicans clinical isolates ) to invade HeLa epithelial cells . First , we analyzed hyphal growth , cell internalization and damage rates and resistance to oxidative stress . Furthermore , we investigated HeLa cell cortactin / actin recruitment and Src - family kinases ( SFK ) / cortactin phosphorylation / activation in response to these isolates . Our data showed that all isolates are capable of invading HeLa cells , recruiting actin / cortactin and inducing SFK and cortactin phosphorylation . Interestingly , L3881 isolate , that has a natural HWP1 mutation , the shortest hyphae and the lowest internalization and damage rates , was able to reach the blood of a patient and to survive under nutritional and oxidative stress , indicating that the latter phenomenon was independent of hyphal length or damage / invasion rate . MATERIALS AND METHODS Candida Strains C . albicans isolates were obtained from various sources : 997 , 5 g was isolated from the blood of a deceased patient ( Chaves et al . , 2012 ) , L3881 ( LEMI # L3881 , Padovan et al . , 2009 ) was isolated from blood of a patient who had candidemia which was cured clinically , and L3837 was an isolate from the oral cavity ( oropharynx , LEMI # L3837 , non - hematogenic ) . C . albicans SC5314 is a reference strain . The isolates were kindly provided by LEMI ( Laboratorio Especial de Micologia , Universidade Federal de São Paulo , Brazil ) . C . albicans isolates were grown at 30 ◦ C on YPD ( 1 % [ w / v ] yeast extract ; 2 % [ w / v ] peptone , 2 % [ w / v ] dextrose ) medium plates . Before performing all experiments , a single colony of C . albicans isolates was inoculated in YPD liquid media and incubated in an orbital shaker at 30 ◦ C for 24 h . Then , C . albicans cells were washed with phosphate buﬀered saline , pH 7 . 2 ( PBS ) , harvested by centrifugation , and counted in a hemocytometer chamber . Cell Culture HeLa cells ( human epithelial cells from a fatal cervical adenocarcinoma ) were obtained from the Instituto Adolfo Lutz ( São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) and maintained in complete RPMI medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) supplemented with antibiotics ( 10 µ g / mL streptomycin and 100 U / mL penicillin ; Sigma – Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 . Antibodies Rabbit anti - pT202 / Y204 ERK1 / 2 ( # 9101S ) and rabbit anti - pY416 SFK ( # 2101S ) were obtained from Cell Signaling , Beverly , MA , USA . Rabbit anti - pY466 cortactin ( PA114115 ) was obtained from Thermo Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA . Mouse monoclonal Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1235 Maza et al . C . albicans HeLa Cell Invasion and Signaling anti - β - actin ( AC - 74 , A2228 ) was obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . Mouse monoclonal anti - cortactin ( A - 4 ; sc - 55578 ) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz County , CA , USA ) . The secondary antibody , goat anti - mouse AlexaFluor R (cid:13) 488 ( A11001 ) , was from Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA . Goat anti - rabbit IgG peroxidase ( A6154 ) and goat anti - mouse IgG peroxidase ( A4416 ) were obtained from Sigma – Aldrich . Hyphal Growth Assay C . albicans blastospores ( 3 × 10 5 ) were seeded in complete RPMI medium at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 for 2 h on glass coverslips in a 24 - well plate . C . albicans cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , washed with phosphate buﬀered saline , pH 7 . 2 ( PBS ) , and analyzed under a BX51 microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) with a 60 × objective . Random images from 10 ﬁelds were acquired by a DP71 camera ( Olympus ) and hyphal lengths were measured using ImageProPlus 6 . 2 software ( Media Cybernetics , Rockville , MD , USA ) . Data were treated and plotted using Oﬃce Excel and Prism 5 ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Experiments were performed in triplicate . Cell Internalization Assay To evaluate cell internalization by C . albicans strains , HeLa cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium on glass coverslips treated with acetic acid until they form conﬂuent monolayers ( 80 – 100 % conﬂuence ) . After washing with PBS , monolayers were seeded with 2 × 10 5 C . albicans blastospores in RPMI 1640 medium without FBS for 2 h at 37 ◦ C in 5 % CO 2 . Coverslips were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min . To stain C . albicans cells localized only to the outside of epithelial cells , coverslips were incubated with 25 µ g / mL Concanavalin A – ﬂuorescein conjugate ( Invitrogen ) in PBS for 45 min . After permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 min , fungal cells localized outside and inside epithelial cells were stained with 10 µ g / mL Calcoﬂuor White ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in 0 . 1 M Tris hydrochloride ( pH 9 . 0 ) for 20 min . After each step , HeLa cells were washed three times with PBS . Coverslips were mounted on slides with 50 % glycerol and analyzed under a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ; Axio Observer Research microscope ) . This method allowed diﬀerentiation between hyphae of the fungus that were located in the external medium and hyphae that invaded the host cell ( intracellular ) ( Almeida et al . , 2008 ) . Three experiments in duplicate were analyzed and 10 randomly chosen ﬁelds per coverslip were evaluated . Epithelial Cell Damage Assay To evaluate the cell damage caused by C . albicans strains , HeLa cells were incubated in complete RPMI medium on glass coverslips treated with acetic acid until they form conﬂuent monolayers ( 80 – 100 % conﬂuence ) . Afterwards , 1 mL PBS was added and removed from each well to wash the cells . Finally , the monolayers were co - incubated with 10 6 C . albicans blastospores in 1 mL RPMI 1640 medium without FBS for 8 h at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 . To quantify cell damage , supernatants were removed and the amount of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) released into the medium was determined using LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) following manufacturer’s instructions . Samples containing only epithelial cells or fungal cells alone were used as controls . Phenotypic Characterization C . albicans blastospores of the SC5314 reference strain and L3881 ( 10 2 – 10 6 ) were seeded in YPD medium plates containing diﬀerent stressor agents : 200 mM CaCl 2 ; 2 mM FeSO 4 ; 200 mM MgCl 2 ; 200 mM NaCl ; 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) ; 0 . 125 µ g / mL 4 - nitroquinoline N - oxide ( 4NQO ) ; 50 µ M camptothecin ( CPT ) ; 0 . 005 % methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) ; 5 mM hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) ; and 1 . 25 mM paraquat ( Pqt ) . Plates were incubated for 24 – 48 h at 30 ◦ C . Host Molecules Recruitment , Immunoﬂuorescence , and Confocal Microscopy HeLa cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium on glass coverslips treated with acetic acid until they form conﬂuent monolayers ( 80 – 100 % conﬂuence ) . After washing with PBS , HeLa cells were seeded with 10 5 C . albicans blastospores in RPMI 1640 medium without FBS for 2 h at 37 ◦ C in 5 % CO 2 . Coverslips were washed with PBS , ﬁxed with 3 . 5 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and sequentially incubated with Calcoﬂuor White ( 10 µ g / mL ) , phalloidin - TRITC ( 10 ng / mL ) , anti - cortactin ( 20 µ g / mL ) and anti - mouse AlexaFluor R (cid:13) 488 ( 20 µ g / mL ) secondary antibodies diluted in PGNS solution ( PBS pH 7 . 2 with 0 . 1 % gelatin [ Sigma – Aldrich ] , 0 . 1 % sodium azide [ Sigma – Aldrich ] and 0 . 2 % saponin [ Sigma – Aldrich ] ) at room temperature in an humidiﬁed chamber for 1 h . Coverslips were mounted on slides in pH 9 . 0 buﬀered glycerol solution with 9 mM p - phenylenediamine . Then , HeLa – C . albicans interactions were evaluated and imaged in a TCS SP5 II Tandem Scanner ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) confocal microscope with a 63 × 1 . 40 NA objective . Image processing and analysis were performed with Imaris v . 7 . 4 . 2 software ( Bitplane , Belfast , Ireland ) or ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) . Signaling and Western Blot Assays Western blots were performed essentially as described by Bonﬁm - Melo et al . ( 2015 ) . HeLa cells were seeded with 10 8 C . albicans blastospores and incubated for various time intervals ( ranging from 0 to 180 min ) at 37 ◦ C in 5 % CO 2 . Protein extracts were quantiﬁed using Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) , according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Statistical Analysis All results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation ( s . d . ) . Diﬀerences were considered statistically signiﬁcant when p < 0 . 05 , as determined by one - way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison post - test . Analyses and graphs were created using Prism 5 ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA , USA ) software . Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1235 Maza et al . C . albicans HeLa Cell Invasion and Signaling RESULTS Hyphal Growth , Internalization , and Damage Rates Hwp1 ( hyphal wall protein 1 ) is a well - characterized C . albicans cell surface protein , expressed only on hyphae , which mediates binding to epithelial cells . The isolate L3881 is a HWP1 - 2 homozygous strain that showed reduced HWP1 expression , bioﬁlm production , and hyphae formation ( Padovan et al . , 2009 ) . In fact , we veriﬁed that C . albicans L3881 produced the shortest hyphae and in HeLa cells produced the lowest internalization and damage rates when compared to other strains ( Figures 1A – C ) . The L3837 oral strain showed similar hyphal lengths to the SC5314 reference strain ( Figures 1A , B ) . HeLa cell internalization and cellular damage rates were lower for L3837 than for SC5314 ( Figures 1C , D ) . The 997 , 5 g isolate also displayed a similar hyphal length when compared to the reference isolate , SC5314 . However , 997 , 5 g displayed the highest cell internalization and cell damage rates ( Figures 1C , D ) in this study . The characteristics of all four Candida species are summarized in the Supplementary Table 1 ( Supplementary Material ) . The L3881 Isolate Showed the Poorest Internalization Fitness but with a High Resistance to Oxidative and Nutritional Stress To explore possible physiological alterations , we tested the SC5314 reference strain and the L3881 blood isolate and analyzed their ability to deal with diﬀerent kinds of stresses ( Figure 1E ) . SC5314 and L3881 strains demonstrated similar sensitivities in the presence of ions such as calcium , magnesium and iron , and during osmotic stress ( NaCl ) . On the other hand , in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , a chelator of bivalent ions , L3881 isolate displayed a more resistant phenotype , indicating lower nutritional requirements needed for maintaining growth . In the presence of DNA damage or stress agents of replication ( 4 - nitro - quinoline - N - oxide [ 4NQO ] ; camptothecin [ CPT ] and methylmethanesulfonate [ MMS ] ) , both strains showed similar phenotypes in response to functional mechanisms of DNA repair . SC5314 and L3881 isolates were also tested in the presence of oxidative stress inducers such as H 2 O 2 and Paraquat ( Pqt ) . Paraquat is a potent oxidative stress inducer because it greatly increases reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and inhibits the regeneration of reducing equivalents and compounds necessary for maintaining the redox status . Surprisingly , L3881 the HWP1 - 2 homozygous strain with reduced HWP1 expression with shortest hyphae and the lowest internalization and damage rates in HeLa cells was found to be more resistant to oxidative stress ( Figure 1E ) . Different Clinical Isolates of C . albicans Invade HeLa Cells and Recruit Actin and Cortactin After observing distinct levels of cell cytotoxicity and invasiveness promoted by diﬀerent isolates , we then evaluated whether host actin and cortactin could be recruited by these isolates and also be diﬀerentially modulated . By staining hyphae , inside and outside HeLa cells , with Calcoﬂuor White and by using Concanavalin A to stain hyphae that were not internalized , we tested the ability of the C . albicans SC5314 reference strain to invade HeLa cells . Figure 2A clearly shows the invasion of HeLa cells by C . albicans hyphae . Figure 2B shows that cortactin was recruited to host cell ruﬄes by C . albicans SC5314 with a similar distribution to that of F - actin recruitment . Actually , all C . albicans isolates recruited cortactin and actin , and both molecules colocalized at sites of hyphae internalization ( Figure 2C ) . Biphasic Activation of ERK Kinase Pathway and Induction of Cortactin - Phosphorylated SFK We ﬁrst tested ERK 1 / 2 ( one of the MAP kinase components ) signaling in response to C . albicans SC5314 invasion in HeLa cells at several time points ( Figure 3 ) . As previously shown with TR146 oral epithelial cells by Moyes et al . ( 2010 ) , C . albicans SC5314 also induced a biphasic MAP kinase response in another cell type , i . e . , HeLa cells ( Figure 3A ) in a characteristic pattern : an increasing activation within the ﬁrst 15 min ( 3 – 15 min ) , followed by a rapid decline ( 30 min ) , and increased activation again beginning at the 75 min time point , ending in a further decline of activation after 120 min ( Figure 3A , 180 min ) . The initial activation was observed directly after contact with yeast cells , possibly due to the recognition of fungal cell wall components ; the second activation phase corresponds to hyphae formation . However , such biphasic activation has not been observed with the other Candida isolates ( not shown ) . We also tested cortactin phosphorylation at Y 466 ( phosphorylated site by SFKs ) under the same conditions ( Figure 3B ) . Cortactin phosphorylation at Y 466 started to increase after 30 – 45 min and was sustained until 75 min of incubation , after which the signal declined . Src - Family Kinases ( SFKs ) and Cortactin Signaling during C . albicans Invasion into HeLa Cells Once our experimental approaches using HeLa cells showed that C . albicans SC5314 induced a biphasic pattern of ERK signaling similar to the one obtained by Moyes et al . ( 2010 ) but in a diﬀerent cell type , we evaluated SFK and cortactin signaling at selected time points in HeLa cells . Figures 3C , D shows that all C . albicans strains induced , at diﬀerent levels , both SFK and cortactin phosphorylation in HeLa cells . Regarding cortactin , 997 , 5 g , oral L3837 and blood L3881 strains also activated cortactin phosphorylation by Src at the Y 466 residue ; this phosphorylation was sustained for at least 180 min of Candida – HeLa cell contact . Lipid rafts have no impact in the epithelial cell invasion of all Candida isolates ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . Conversely , SFK inhibition negatively modulated all Candida albicans isolates invasion to HeLa cells ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) .

( D ) For cytotoxicity assays , HeLa cells were seeded with blastospores for 8 h at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 , washed and the amount of lactate dehydrogenase in culture supernatants was quantiﬁed by a commercial kit .

( E ) L3881 showed more plasticity under stress . 10 2 – 10 6 blastospores of the SC5314 reference strain and L3881 blood isolate were seeded on plates containing different stressor agents for 24 – 48 h at 30 ◦ C .

DISCUSSION Candida albicans is an opportunistic human pathogen that can cause superﬁcial and hematogenous infections . The latter result in substantial morbidity and mortality and are a common , costly problem in healthcare settings . To access the systemic circulation , C . albicans has to invade both epithelial and endothelial barriers . For epithelial cells , two mechanisms have been described their invasion by C . albicans : active penetration and induced , actin - driven endocytosis . In this study , we have demonstrated that C . albicans strains—the reference strain SC5314 and three isolates with diﬀerent clinical backgrounds—can invade HeLa cells and recruit cortactin and actin to sites of hyphae internalization , suggesting that at least part of the invasion process is mediated by induced endocytosis—which is dependent on dynamic microﬁlaments of the host—independently of the source of the clinical isolate .

Invasive Ability , Cortactin / Actin Recruitment , Induction of Src / Cortactin Phosphorylation and Survival Under Oxidative Stress by C . albicans Are Independent of Hyphal Length or Damage / Internalization Rates In this study , all isolates of C . albicans from varying clinical backgrounds were able to invade and damage HeLa cells to diﬀerent levels , and induced the accumulation of cortactin and actin around C . albicans hyphae that were in the process of being internalized by HeLa cells . Similar eﬀects were observed for the reference strain , SC5314 , in other epithelial cell types ( Moreno - Ruiz et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , the invasive ability of C . albicans is apparently not related to the clinical background of the isolate . It is noteworthy that 997 , 5 g strain—isolated from the blood of a patient who died within 24 h ( unpublished results ) —exhibited the greatest ability of all isolates tested to both internalize cells and cause damage in vitro . Conversely , C . albicans L3881—isolated from the blood of a patient who had experienced candidemia but had undergone a clinical cure—expressed the HWP1 - 2 allele and showed very reduced levels of HWP1 mRNA expression ( Padovan et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to displaying the shortest hyphae , as expected , C . albicans L3881 also showed the lowest rate of damage and internalization . Despite this , C . albicans L3881 was able to reach blood vessels , invade HeLa cells , recruit actin / cortactin , activate Src and cortactin by phosphorylation and , interestingly , survive under the pressure of nutritional and oxidative stress ( i . e . , ROS ) . It is worth mentioning that many groups have previously shown the importance of hyphae length using HWP1 mutants . For instance , Tsuchimori et al . ( 2000 ) have shown that a HWP1 deletion mutant forms shorter hyphae and has decreased endothelial cell adherence , uptake and damage . Moreover , Wächtler et al . ( 2011 ) have examined a number of mutants for adhesion , internalization and damage of oral epithelial cells and have shown that a mutant with a HWP1 deletion has signiﬁcant reduction in its epithelial cell adhesion and damage , but not internalization , which already indicates that hyphal length is likely to be important , but not an obstacle to cellular invasion . Indeed , in all cases , the deletions have been constructed artiﬁcially and the cell types used were diﬀerent from this present study . As a host defense mechanism , the production of ROS is a marked characteristic of phagocytic cells , which use such oxygen intermediates to kill invading pathogens . On one hand , C . albicans is relatively resistant to ROS , tolerating up to 20 mmol / L hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) under some conditions ( Brown et al . , 2014 ) . Given that adaptation to oxidative stress is essential for pathogenicity , one can conclude that the inactivation of detoxifying enzymes , such as superoxide dismutases by C . albicans lead to severe attenuations in virulence and viability inside immune cells . Upon interaction with pathogens , phagocytes rapidly produce ROS . The ability to counteract oxidative attack by the patient would presumably aid fungal adaptation and invasiveness through the host . In the present study , L3881 isolate was resistant to oxidative stress and could reach the blood vessels of the patient , despite displaying a HWP1 natural deletion and the shorter hyphae . It is an open question whether L3881 subverts the innate immune response by mediating the eﬃcient detoxiﬁcation of host - derived ROS , which ultimately allows it to reach deep tissues such as blood vessels . Moreover , L3881 was also more resistant to EDTA than the SC5314 reference strain . This evidence indicates that the L3881 blood isolate has developed plasticity to deal with challenges and maintain its growth under diﬀerent environmental conditions . Cortactin possesses a series of C - terminal tyrosines that are heavily Src - phosphorylated and implicated in regulating actin remodeling during cell motility ( Head et al . , 2003 ) . Phosphorylation of cortactin by Src greatly enhanced Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization ( Tehrani et al . , 2007 ) . This event required Nck , an adaptor that links phosphorylated cortactin with neuronal WASp ( N - WASp ) and WASp - interacting protein ( WIP ) to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , enhancing polymerization . Src phosphorylation of cortactin is important for actin polymerization during host cell invasion by some bacteria ( Shigella ﬂexneri and Staphylococcus aureus ) or parasites ( Cryptosporidium parvum ) ( Chen et al . , 2003 ; Bougnères et al . , 2004 ; Agerer et al . , 2005 ) . The C . albicans reference strain and clinical isolates activated Src phosphorylation and consequently Src phosphorylation of cortactin ( Y466 ) during HeLa cell invasion , thus pointing to a concerted series of events involving phosphorylation , and culminating in actin remodeling and actin - driven C . albicans invasion . Actin - driven invasion is a process that can be interrupted by both the up - and down - regulation of actin polymerization , thus drawing attention to the fact that actin polymerization must be carefully controlled to generate productive results ; excessive assembly can bring the network to a halt ( Haglund and Welch , 2011 ) . The tyrosine SFKs play a fundamental role in a wide variety of cellular processes including morphogenesis and proliferation , phagocytosis and host – pathogen interactions . In this study , it became clear that SFKs are important for C . albicans invasion , which has been evidenced by the decrease of internalization rate of all Candida isolates into HeLa cells when using a SFK inhibitor . SFKs normally drive actin - dependent rearrangements required for cellular migration and may be used by the fungus to promote cell invasion in the same way of several bacteria ( Mounier et al . , 2009 ) . Upon pathogen - cell adhesion , SFKs may associate to and activate other molecules such as FAK to regulate several actin - related processes , including phosphorylation of key substrates such as paxillin and cortactin ( Ferreira et al . , 2016 ) . It has also been shown that activation of host cell SFK is correlated to the actin dependent internalization of bacterial pathogens ( Pizarro - Cerdá et al . , 2016 ) . Src - dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton has been also reported for viruses and parasites , suggesting that such signaling corresponds to a common feature that controls actin dynamics at the membrane ( Mitra and Schlaepfer , 2006 ; Munter et al . , 2006 ) . Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 8 July 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1235 Maza et al . C . albicans HeLa Cell Invasion and Signaling As far as we know this is the ﬁrst time that the inhibition of Src - familiy kinases has been shown to hinder host cell invasion by C . albicans , pointing to a key role for SFK in driving actin polymerization and consequently the internalization of C . albicans . Several pathogens have been described to enter professional phagocyte cells via cholesterol - enriched membrane lipid raft microdomains . In fact , C . albicans uptake by human monocyte has been strongly impaired by the cholesterol extracting agent methyl - β - cyclodextrin in the study by de Turris et al . ( 2015 ) . It is worth mentioning that HeLa cells are not professional phagocytes as monocytes or macrophages . This is probably why the disruption of lipid rafts in HeLa cells did not impact on C . albicans internalization . Collectively , these results suggest that C . albicans invasion of HeLa epithelial cells—and also the ability to reach and adapt to live in blood—may be independent of fungal adherence and hyphal length , or even the ability to damage cells , since L3881 , isolated from a patient’s blood , has been able to both invade cells and , recruit actin / cortactin , activate SFKs and cortactin , survive under nutritional and oxidative stress and reach blood tissues , despite its shorter hyphae . Final Consideration—Building a Niche When discussing C . albicans invasion , it is known that to infect mucosal tissues , gain access to blood and escape blood ﬂow , C . albicans must interact with both epithelial and endothelial cells , respectively ( Davis , 2009 ) . In superﬁcial infections ( skin and mucosa ) , this fungus only reaches blood vessels when a mechanical disruption ( wound or cut ) to epithelial tissue occurs . Interestingly , oropharyngeal candidiasis is prevalent in HIV - positive patients and , although rare ( especially in the terminally ill ) , HIV - positive patients can develop systemic candidiasis . Regarding the mechanisms involved in Candida penetration of epithelial cells , what is known from in vitro experiments is that active penetration is the predominant form of invasion , while induced endocytosis seems to occur in the initial phases of tissue colonization ( Wächtler et al . , 2012 ) . The fungus uses a variety of strategies in order to survive ; other types of interactions may exist in vivo that we have not yet seen in vitro . In systemic infections , it is believed that the gastrointestinal tract is a major source of Candida invasion in addition to catheters or surgery , for example ( Perlroth et al . , 2007 ) . The basic pH of gastrointestinal tissue , its 37 ◦ C temperature , ample contact with epithelial cells and an iron - restricted environment are strong inducers of hyphae formation , i . e . , this fungus always forms hyphae when it meets its host ( Almeida et al . , 2008 ) . However , in infected organs , hyphae , yeasts and pseudohyphae can be observed by histological analysis , probably because yeasts are part of the proliferation process ( the more yeasts present , the more hyphae formed ) . However , the importance of pseudohyphae remains unknown . Hematogenous infections caused by pathogens of the Candida genus have increased heavily in Latin America ( Doi et al . , 2016 ) mainly because modern medical treatments are becoming more invasive and more people are being treated with immunosuppressive drugs . Hematogenous candidiasis is a silent disease . Often , clinicians are only able to detect the infectious agent when the patient already has an irreversible condition . The mortality rate for hematogenous candidiasis is 40 – 60 % , which are devastating numbers . However , drugs commonly used to control the infection cause pathogen resistance . Epithelial cells play a key role in many human – microbiota and / or pathogens interactions . Interactions of these cells with C . albicans have been shown to be critical to host and fungal cell responses ( Moyes et al . , 2015 ) . Molecules of both Candida and the host are important for Candida internalization into epithelial cells , which is the ﬁrst step to further dissemination leading to hematogenic infections . A better elucidation of these factors may signiﬁcantly contribute to the control of systemic infections in hospitals , such as the rational development of new compounds against the essential components triggered during the invasion of host cells by the fungus .
