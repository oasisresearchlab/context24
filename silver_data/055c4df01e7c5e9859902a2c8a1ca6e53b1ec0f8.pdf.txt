And IPMC ( Ionic Polymer Metal Composite ) can generate large bending motions under a low driving voltage ( about 1 V ) , and it has a good response and soft characteristic . In this paper , we have developed a new jellyfish type of microrobot which can imitate the jellyfish . It has a movement process as the jellyfish does when it is floating and sinking . The process of floating and sinking can be controlled . Four legs using IPMC actuators are designed to replace the antennae of the jellyfish . Characteristic of the underwater microrobot is measured . Some improvement has been done for higher efficiency . The experimental results indicate that the moving and swimming speed of underwater microrobot can be controlled by changing the frequency of input voltage . Index Terms – Jellyfish ; Microrobot ; Ionic Polymer Metal Composite actuator ; Micromechanism I . I NTRODUCTION In medical and industrial fields , a fish - like robot has obtained great attention due to its compactness , high efficiency , noiseless motions and great steering capability . Many microrobots have been developed for various purposes due to the advances of the precise process technology . The microrobots can work in a very small space . For instance , with medical technology a common application is to perform a delicate surgical operation supported by using micro machines [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] . Recently , significant progress on the researches of fish - like robot using piezoelectric actuator , shape memory actuator and polymer actuator has been reported [ 4 ] - [ 5 ] . But , some problems such as electric leakage , safety in water , less compactness and high stiffness have appeared in real applications . The IPMC actuator requires and consumes relatively low voltage and electric power . It can produce fairly large bending motion compared to piezo and SMA actuators . In addition it can be actuated in a wet condition or even in water . So , various fish - like robots using IPMC actuator have been designed . These fish - like robots have the characteristics of flexibility , driven by a low voltage , good response and safety in body [ 6 ] - [ 11 ] . The IPMC actuator has the characteristic that when the frequency of the applied voltage is less than 0 . 3Hz , water around the IPMC surface is electrolysed , so water bled on both side of the IPMC surface is generated . Changing the body volume , buoyancy of the microrobot can be controlled [ 12 ] - [ 17 ] . But there are still some questions while floating . The microrobot can’t stay still at any places as we want . The process of floating and sinking can’t be controlled freely . So , in this paper a new kind of microrobot is presented . This kind of microrobot is designed to imitate the jellyfish . It has a movement process as the jellyfish does when it is floating and sinking . Moreover , four legs are designed to replace the antennae of the jellyfish . The experimental results indicate that it is controlled better than former ones . II . T HE D ESIGN A ND M ANUFACTURE O F T HE M ICROROBOT The structure of the microrobot is shown in Fig . 1 . This microrobot consists of the body , four legs , SMA actuator and lead wires . The body is made of rubber material shaped as a hemisphere . The four legs are driven by IPMC actuators respectively . SMA actuator is installed in the body . The lead wires supply electric energy to IPMC actuators and SMA actuator . Fig . 1 Structure of the microrobot ( a ) IPMC actuator is made from the film of perfluorosulfonic acid polymer chemically plated on it’s both sides with platinum . The conformation is shown in Fig . 2 . It has been known to be a kind of ion exchange membrane . IPMC is a sort of high polymer gel actuator . It can only work in water or wet condition . As shown in Fig . 3 , the IPCF is bent into anode side when the voltage is about 1 . 5V on its surfaces . Displacement of bending is proportional to the voltage applied on its surface with the swelling of polymer gels . When the frequency of the voltage is less than 0 . 3Hz , the water nearby the surface of IPMC is electrolysed . The movement process of legs is shown in Fig . 4 and Fig . 5 . SMA actuator is used in the body of the microrobot . When it shrinks with applying the voltage at its ends , the volume of the body is then reduced . The water in the body is extruded out . So the buoyancy is changed and an upward force is produced . If the force arrives at a certain value , the whole body can float up . Controlling the frequency of the actuator’s shrinkage and the voltage between its two ends , the 1 - 4244 - 0828 - 8 / 07 / $ 20 . 00 © 2007 IEEE . 509 Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation August 5 - 8 , 2007 , Harbin , China upward force can be changed . As a result , the microrobot can float up , stay still , and sink down at any position we want .

C HARACTERISTIC M EASUREMENT O F T HE B ODY The robot is placed in a flume as shown in Fig . 9 . The electric voltage is controlled by a computer . In order to obtain the average speeds of the robot at different voltage , we choose the measuring distance as 20mm . When the voltage is changed from 1V to 12V , the floating time is measured . Then we can calculate the speeds at different voltage value . The results are shown in Fig . 10 . From the results we can see that the speed increases with increasing the voltage value . But when the electrical voltage is less than 8V , the speed doesn’t change while changing the voltage value . The theoretical floating speeds can also be obtained . According to the principle of hydrodynamics , we can calculate the relative value between the body and the water extruded out of the body through the expression A Q U (cid:32) ( 1 ) where Q is the average volume of the water that has been extruded out of the body per second , and A is the area of the cross section . The average volume per second can be measured as shown in Fig . 11 . At first , the body is full of water . The gross weight is 12 . 24g . Changing the value of the voltage , and the volume can be measured at a certain time . Because the floating process consists of two motions , shrinkage and comeback , we should consider the time of comeback process . Then the average volume changed per second is calculated in the whole process . The results are shown in Fig . 12 . At last , we can get the theoretical floating speeds through the expression U m m u 1 (cid:32) ( 2 ) where 1 m is the mass of water which is extruded out of the body , and m is the gross weight . There are some errors between the theoretical value and the experimental value as shown in Fig . 13 .

I MPROVEMENT T HE B ODY O F T HE M ICROROBOT Because the volume changes a little in above experiment and the floating speed is slow , so we need to improve the body of the robot . There are another two methods as shown in Fig . 14 . ( b ) Spiral type ( c ) Two rinks type Fig . 14 Two new types of bodies The experiments of characteristic measurement are the same with former one as shown in Fig . 11 . We can get the average volume changed per second as shown in Fig . 15 . From the results we can see that ( c ) has the largest volume changed per second at the same electrical voltage value . In addition , ( b ) needs a higher electrical voltage to shrink , though its volume can change a lot . For the low voltage’s need , we choose ( c ) to continue our experiments . The dimensions of body are shown in TABLE II . Then we measure the speeds with the same method as above . The results are shown in Fig . 16 . Also , we can gain the theoretical value according to calculation . In the Fig . 17 , we compare the experimental value with the theoretical value . From the results of compare , we can see that experimental value improves a lot and it approaches the theoretical value very well .

L EGS A ND C HARACTERISTICS O F T HE R OBOT According to above experiments , the developed microrobot is made as shown in Fig . 18 . The dimensions are listed in TABLE III . Then the walking speeds are measured at different values of frequency as shown in Fig . 19 . From the results in Fig . 20 we can see that the walking speed has the maximum value at about 0 . 6Hz . Below 0 . 6Hz , the walking speed increases while increasing the frequency of the input voltage . When the value of frequency is over 0 . 6Hz , the walking speed starts to slow down because of the delay of bending . The bending process needs some time . If the frequency of input voltage is too high , the leg can’t bend to its maximum displacement .

It is measured at 5V and 10V respectively while changing the frequency . The curves are shown in Fig . 22 . The maximum displacement is in inverse proportion to the frequency of the input voltage . From the principle of legs we can calculate the theoretical speed through the expression f d u (cid:117) (cid:32) 2 ( 3 ) There are some errors between the theoretical speed and the experimental speed . It is because the in Fig . 21 there is no loads on the IPMC actuator . In the experiment of speed measurement the whole body is placed on the legs . The legs can’t behave as do in Fig . 21 . Otherwise , friction loss and water resistance exist , so the real value of displacement in one period is shorter than 2 d .

C ONCLUSIONS In this paper , we propose a new type of microrobot that can imitates the jellyfish . This kind of microrobot has a movement process as the jellyfish does when it is floating and sinking . The process of floating and sinking can be controlled by changing the electrical voltage applied on both end of SMA actuator and the floating speed can also be controlled . And the robot can stop and stay still in the water while floating . Four legs using IPMC actuators are designed to replace the antennae of the jellyfish . The walking speed can be controlled by changing the frequency of input voltage . The experimental results indicate that the walking and swimming speed of underwater microrobot can be controlled by changing the frequency of input voltage . Then it can be used in medical and industrial fields . A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported in part by the National High Technology Research and Development Program , China .
