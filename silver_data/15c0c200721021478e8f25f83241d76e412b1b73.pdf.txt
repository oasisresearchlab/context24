The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an organism well suited for a genetic analysis of this process . In particu - lar , three types of genetic studies have contributed to our understanding of synaptic vesicle endocytosis . First , screens for mutants defective in synaptic vesicle recycling have identiﬁed new proteins that function speciﬁcally in neurons . Second , RNA interference has been used to quickly conﬁrm the roles of known pro - teins in endocytosis . Third , gene targeting techniques have elucidated the roles of genes thought to play modulatory or subtle roles in synaptic vesicle recyc - ling . We describe a molecular model for synaptic ves - icle recycling and discuss how protein disruption ex - periments in C . elegans have contributed to this model . Key words : C . elegans , neurotransmission , synaptic vesicle , endocytosis Received 15 June 2001 , revised and accepted for publi - cation 27 June 2001 Neurons communicate with each other by secreting neuro - transmitters at synapses between cells ( Figure 1 ) . Classical neurotransmitters , such as GABA , glutamate , and acetylcho - line are small molecules , which are synthesized in the cyto - plasm and packaged into synaptic vesicles . Synaptic vesicles require a large repertoire of proteins to function ( 1 ) . Synaptic vesicle proteins are required for transport of the vesicle to the nerve terminal , loading of neurotransmitter into the synaptic vesicle , association of the vesicle with the cytoskeleton , and docking the vesicle at the plasma membrane in preparation for release . Of particular importance is the vesicle - associated SNARE protein synaptobrevin ( VAMP ) , which is required for fusion , and synaptotagmin , which is the calcium sensor re - quired for regulated release . Fusion results in the dispersion of synaptic vesicle proteins into the plasma membrane . 597 These proteins must be retrieved to regenerate a functional synaptic vesicle . Although a direct route for the recovery of synaptic vesicles , called ‘kiss and run’ exocytosis , may exist ( 2 ) , the primary mechanism for membrane and protein re - trieval is through clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Figure1 : The synaptic vesicle cycle . Synaptic vesicles in the re - serve pool are held near release sites by the cytoskeleton . They can be mobilized to dock with the plasma membrane , but only primed vesicles are readily releasable when the neuron is depolarized . Cal - cium inﬂux causes the vesicle membrane to fuse with the plasma membrane and neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft . The synaptic vesicle proteins and membrane must be recovered via endocytosis . Finally , the regenerated vesicles need to be loaded with neurotransmitter to make a mature synaptic vesicle . Harris et al . There are four steps to synaptic vesicle recycling : recruit - ment , budding , ﬁssion , and uncoating ( Figure 3 ) ( 3 ) . First , during recruitment , the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 and synaptic vesicle proteins are recruited to the site of endo - cytosis . AP2 then facilitates the recruitment of clathrin to the presumptive vesicle . This suggests that a region of the plasma membrane is marked for endocytosis and that the AP2 complex and synaptic vesicle proteins are speciﬁcally recruited to this region . These observations introduce two questions : What proteins are required for the targeting of AP2 to the plasma membrane ? What proteins are required to recruit synaptic vesicle proteins to the site of endocytosis ? In the second step of synaptic vesicle recycling , assembly of the clathrin matrix pulls membrane into the cell to form a budding vesicle . Synaptic vesicles are uniform in size ; how - ever , in in vitro experiments , clathrin self - assembles into cages that are of variable sizes ( 4 ) . This suggests that , al - though clathrin is sufﬁcient for the formation of vesicles , it is insufﬁcient to regulate the size of the vesicle . What compo - nents assist clathrin in forming the vesicle and in regulating its size ? Third , during the ﬁssion step , the GTPase dynamin is required to cleave the clathrin - coated vesicle from the plasma mem - brane . Dynamin interacts with a variety of proteins and lipids of the synaptic vesicle ( 5 ) . These interactions may serve to position dynamin at the neck of the vesicle prior to cleavage . Is the primary function of these dynamin - interacting proteins to localize dynamin , or do they play additional roles as well ? In the fourth step , the clathrin coat is removed from the re - cycled vesicle . This step occurs very rapidly , suggesting that it is tightly regulated . One protein with a well - documented in vitro role in clathrin coat removal is the ATPase chaperone Hsc70 . How is Hsc70 action regulated in vivo ? What proteins remove the clathrin coat from the vesicle ? What proteins re - move the clathrin adaptor complexes after endocytosis ? Perturbation Studies of Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis A large number of proteins have already been described that are thought to play a role in endocytosis [ Table1 , and review - ed in ( 6 ) ] . Most of these were identiﬁed based on interac - tions with other endocytic proteins . Subsequent disruption experiments , such as antibody or peptide injections , have conﬁrmed the requirement for many of these proteins in syn - aptic vesicle endocytosis . Injected antibodies bind the target protein and block its function by occluding other protein inter - actions . Injections of speciﬁc antibodies into neurons , such as the lamprey reticulospinal neurons , have been shown to block synaptic vesicle endocytosis [ for examples , see ( 7 , 8 ) ] . Peptides can also be injected into cells ( 9 , 10 ) . These peptides usually comprise an interaction domain of a protein , and dis - rupt speciﬁc protein – protein interactions by competing with the endogenous interaction . Both types of disruption experi - 598 Trafﬁc 2001 ; 2 : 597 – 605 ments have limitations . First , the disrupted protein may still have residual function resulting in a phenotype that is less severe than expected for a null mutation . Second , the disrup - tion may affect other proteins , and the phenotype may be more severe than expected for a loss of the protein . An alter - native to these types of perturbation experiments is to study mutations in the genes encoding these proteins in a genetic model organism . The nematode C . elegans is well suited for genetic studies of endocytosis for several reasons ( 11 ) . First , C . elegans is easily maintained in the laboratory and has a rapid generation time of only 3 days . Second , the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis are conserved in C . elegans . The worm genome encodes all of the proteins that have been implicated in en - docytosis from previous biochemical and protein disruption experiments ( Table1 ) . Third , functional redundancy has proven to be less of a problem in C . elegans than in ver - tebrate systems . The genome of C . elegans frequently has single copies of genes that are found in multiple copies in vertebrates . Fourth , the greatest beneﬁt of studying a biologi - cal process in C . elegans is that gene disruptions can be easily generated . For this reason , the next part of this review will discuss the forward and reverse genetic techniques that are available in C . elegans . The goal of forward genetics is to identify the molecules in - volved in a biological process . Forward genetic screens ident - ify mutants that are defective in that process . Here , we dis - cuss screens for mutants with defects in synaptic vesicle re - cycling ; these mutants usually exhibit an uncoordinated phenotype . The starting point for reverse genetics is an inter - esting molecule . The goal of the geneticist is to identify the biological process in which the molecule functions . We dis - cuss two approaches , RNA interference ( RNAi ) and targeted deletion , which are used to disrupt proteins implicated in en - docytosis . Forward genetic screens The main strength of C . elegans is its use in forward genetic screens . Several unusual attributes of this organism have fa - cilitated the identiﬁcation of genes that function in synaptic vesicle recycling . First , the C . elegans nervous system is largely nonessential in the laboratory . Feeding is mediated by a muscular pump that requires almost no neuronal inner - vation ( 12 , 13 ) . Moreover , reproduction does not require a functional nervous system , since C . elegans are self - fertilizing hermaphrodites . Thus , even mutations that severely disrupt nervous system function are likely to be viable , and recover - able in a genetic screen . Second , not only are mutants defective for nervous system function viable , but such mutants can be selected in muta - genic screens , speciﬁcally , by using pharmacological agents such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . At neuromuscular junctions acetylcholine is released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis . Acetylcholine in the cleft is degraded by acetyl - cholinesterase .

This accumulation will eventually kill a worm due to chronic activation of acetylcholine receptors . Mutants that cannot generate synaptic vesicles due to defects in vesicle re - cycling , or mutants that cannot release vesicles due to defects in exocytosis cannot release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft . Such mutants are resistant to acetylcholinesterase inhibi - tors . Genetic screens have led to the identiﬁcation of 22 genes in this pathway ( 15 – 17 ) . It should eventually be possible using such drug resistance assays to conduct a saturation mutagen - esis , identifying all the genes capable of being mutated to the resistant phenotype . Five mutants resistant to acetylcholin - esterase inhibitors disrupt synaptic vesicle recycling . These mutants , dyn - 1 ( dynamin ) , snt - 1 ( synaptotagmin ) , unc - 11 ( AP180 ) , unc - 26 ( synaptojanin ) , and unc - 41 also exhibit simi - lar behavioral phenotypes ; they are small , slow growing , and move in a jerky uncoordinated phenotype ( 18 – 21 ) . Despite the success of forward genetic screens in C . ele - gans , certain classes of genes will not be isolated in these screens . In particular , essential genes that mutate to lethality will be lost in most forward screens . Furthermore , genes that play a modulatory role will likely lead to extremely subtle phenotypes that are easily overlooked in a genetic screen . To address these problems , two reverse genetic approaches 599 Trafﬁc 2001 ; 2 : 597 – 605 can be employed – RNA interference of gene function and the generation of targeted deletions . RNA interference RNA interference ( RNAi ) can perturb protein function without requiring the generation of a mutant . Using this method , double - stranded RNA , which is identical in sequence to the gene to be disrupted , is introduced into the worm by injec - tion or feeding ( 22 , 23 ) . The double - stranded RNA targets the endogenous mRNA for degradation and thereby blocks synthesis of the protein ( 24 ) . RNAi has been used to study proteins that are required for endocytosis in all tissues . Muta - tions in genes such as this are difﬁcult to isolate in standard forward genetic screens , and would be absent altogether in a screen based on behavioral phenotypes of the adult . For example , RNAi has been used to study the importance of clathrin and the clathrin adaptor complex in C . elegans ( 25 ) . This study demonstrated that these proteins are essential for viability of the organism . Although RNAi is an effective method for disrupting genes required early during worm de - velopment , it also possesses certain limitations . The method is less effective for proteins required post - embryonically , and is speciﬁcally ineffective against proteins expressed in neu - rons ( 22 , 26 ) . To study genes thought to play more subtle roles in endocytosis in the nervous system , conventional mutations are required . Harris et al . Deletion mutants Proteins that play a modulatory role are likely to lead to subtle phenotypes , and would be difﬁcult to recover in forward gen - etic screens . The function of such proteins can still be deter - mined in C . elegans by searching for small deletions that speciﬁcally remove the gene ( 27 ) . Using this method , worms are exposed to mutagens which introduce double - strand breaks . A deletion of a particular gene in a strain is identiﬁed by PCR . Using this methodology , a deletion knockout was isolated and used to characterize the requirement for the C . elegans homolog of Eps15 ( EHS - 1 ) in synaptic vesicle recyc - ling ( 28 ) . Both forward and reverse genetic approaches have their in - herent biases . Forward genetics is good for identifying pre - viously unknown proteins that act in a speciﬁc process . How - ever , if a gene is mutated to lethality or plays a subtle modulatory role , it will be difﬁcult to recover in such screens . On the other hand , reverse genetics is useful for determining the function of a previously identiﬁed protein , but the protein must be implicated in that process before it will be targeted . Using both forward and reverse genetic approaches will en - able a thorough analysis of endocytosis in C . elegans . A Molecular Model for Synaptic Vesicle Recycling In the introduction , we described the four steps in the recycling of a synaptic vesicle : recruitment , budding , ﬁssion , and un - coating . We also described some of the remaining questions at each of these steps . In the remainder of this review we will revisit these issues , describing the contributions of studies in C . elegans to the resolution of these mysteries in relation to a model for synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( Figure 2 ) . Synaptic vesicle protein and clathrin recruitment The initial stages of vesicle recycling can be divided into three related steps : marking a region of the plasma membrane for internalization , recruitment of vesicle proteins to the site of endocytosis , followed by the recruitment of clathrin . The sig - nals that designate the region of membrane to be recycled are not known , but are likely to depend on both speciﬁc lipid and protein interactions . Targeting of the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 to the membrane may be sufﬁcient to demar - cate a region for endocytosis . Studies of receptor - mediated endocytosis reveal that interactions between the m 2 subunit of AP2 and the receptor assist in receptor internalization ( 33 ) . Thus , there is a direct link between the protein targeted for endocytosis and clathrin assembly . A candidate for the AP2 receptor during the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles is synaptotagmin , the putative calcium sensor for synaptic ves - icle exocytosis . Following exocytosis , this synaptic vesicle protein will be located in the plasma membrane and could signal to the endocytic machinery that there are proteins that need to be recycled . Because synaptotagmin is located on the vesicle but resides on the plasma membrane following vesicle fusion , it is in the appropriate position to recruit the 600 Trafﬁc 2001 ; 2 : 597 – 605 Figure2 : A model for synaptic vesicle endocytosis . 1 .

Clathrin is removed by the action of auxilin and the ATPase Hsc70 . The adaptors are removed by synaptojanin . Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis in C . elegans endocytic complex to the plasma membrane . The ﬁrst evi - dence of a role for synaptotagmin in endocytosis came from biochemical experiments which demonstrated that the C2B domain of synaptotagmin binds to both m 2 and a - adaptin subunits of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex ( 8 , 34 – 36 ) . In vivo support for a role of synaptotagmin in synaptic vesicle recycling came from studies of the C . elegans snt - 1 mutant ( 31 ) . Animals defective for synaptotagmin exhibit a depletion of synaptic vesicles at the neuromuscular junction , as re - vealed in electron micrographs ( Figure 3 ) . A block in vesicle recovery from the membrane causes this depletion , rather than a failure in the de novo production of synaptic vesicles . If axonal transport of vesicles is blocked , vesicles accumulate in the neuron cell body , demonstrating that vesicles are still synthesized in the absence of synaptotagmin . Moreover , other synaptic vesicle proteins are transported to the synapse in synaptotagmin mutants . However , these proteins are dif - fusely distributed in the plasma membrane at the terminal , because they are not recycled and sequestered into synaptic vesicles . Thus , it is likely that the adaptor complex is directed to a site of endocytosis by interactions with a speciﬁc synaptic vesicle protein . Other data from C . elegans mutants indicate that lipids may also play a role in AP2 recruitment . The unc - 26 gene encodes the C . elegans homolog of the synaptojanin protein ( 19 ) . Synaptojanin is a polyphosphoinositide phospha - tase implicated in vesicle recycling by its interactions with amphiphysin ( 37 ) . Synaptojanin contains two distinct phos - phatase domains that cleave phosphates at the 3 - , 4 - , and 5 - positions from polyphosphoinositides ( 37 , 38 ) . Synaptic vesicles are depleted in unc - 26 mutants ( Figure 3 ) ( 19 ) . This depletion is partly due to a defect in ﬁssion of endo - cytic pits . However , the number of synaptic vesicles trapped as endocytic intermediates is not equal to the number of syn - aptic vesicles normally found at a synapse . These data sug - gest that there may be a defect in the recruitment of clathrin or clathrin adaptors to the sites of endocytosis . One potential target of synaptojanin function may be synaptotagmin . The C2B domain of synaptotagmin binds PIP 2 ( 39 ) ; this associ - ation may occlude interactions of the C2B domain with the AP2 clathrin adaptor proteins ( 36 ) . Accumulation of PIP 2 in the absence of synaptojanin may result in a sequestration of synaptotagmin C2B domains by membrane interactions and hence block clathrin recruitment . The AP2 adaptor complex is another potential target for syn - aptojanin function . AP2 binding to phosphoinositide - 3 , 4 , 5 - Figure3 : The C . elegans neuromuscular junction . Synaptic vesicles are clustered around the presynaptic specialization at a C . elegans neuromuscular junction in the wild type . In synaptotagmin mutants ( snt - 1 ) , synaptic vesicles are partially depleted . In synapto - janin mutants ( unc - 26 ) , synaptic vesicles are severely depleted and those that are present are bound to a cytoskeletal ﬁlament . 601 Trafﬁc 2001 ; 2 : 597 – 605 Harris et al . trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) inhibits binding of the complex to clathrin ( 40 ) ; accumulation of PIP 3 in synaptojanin mutants may inhibit clathrin assembly at the membrane . Alternatively , coated pits may be rare in synaptojanin mutants because clathrin abundance is limiting for pit formation ( 41 ) . In this case synaptojanin may not play a speciﬁc role at the recruit - ment stage of endocytosis , but because it is required to liber - ate clathrin at later steps , clathrin is depleted and as a conse - quence an early defect in endocytosis is observed . It is not clear that the recruitment defect in unc - 26 mutants is due to a loss of phosphatase activity . Synaptojanin binds to other members of the endocytic complex , such as amphiphys - in , endophilin , syndapin , and intersectin ( 37 , 42 – 44 ) . There - fore , the recruitment defect observed in unc - 26 mutants could be due to a failure in forming interactions with other proteins required for endocytosis . However , one of the severest synap - tojanin mutations in C . elegans is a point mutation in the active site of the 5 - phosphatase domain , suggesting that the lipid ca - talysis is the relevant function of synaptojanin ( 19 ) . Despite the uncertainty of the role that unc - 26 plays in recruitment of clathrin , it does appear that there is a speciﬁc requirement for phospholipid composition in this process based on the large number of lipid binding proteins involved . Once a region on the plasma membrane has been marked for endocytosis , synaptic vesicle proteins must be recruited to this site so that they can be incorporated into the recycling vesicle . It is possible that synaptic vesicle proteins bind to each other to form a raft of proteins in the plasma membrane . Alternatively , specialized adaptors may recruit particular pro - teins to sites of clathrin assembly . An adaptor protein appears to be required for synaptobrevin recruitment . Speciﬁcally , synaptobrevin recycling requires the clathrin assembly pro - tein AP180 ( 21 ) . In C . elegans AP180 ( unc - 11 ) mutants , GFP - tagged synaptobrevin is diffusely distributed on the plasma membrane , indicating that it is not recovered from the mem - brane . Other vesicle proteins , such as synaptotagmin , colo - calize with synaptic vesicle clusters , indicating that these pro - teins are normally recovered from the plasma membrane . These data suggest that AP180 is speciﬁcally required for synaptobrevin recruitment , although a direct interaction be - tween synaptobrevin and AP180 has not been demonstrated . Other proteins might require different proteins for recruitment to the site of endocytosis . After synaptic vesicle proteins are localized to sites of endo - cytosis , clathrin triskelions , composed of three heavy chains and three light chains , assemble into a lattice on the plasma membrane at these sites ( 45 ) . Clathrin recruitment and as - sembly is promoted by binding to the clathrin adaptor pro - teins AP2 and AP180 , which are targeted to sites of endo - cytosis by interacting with speciﬁc proteins and phospho - lipids in the plasma membrane ( 40 , 46 , 47 ) . Vesicle budding As the clathrin matrix assembles on the plasma membrane , the membrane begins to invaginate . Clathrin probably as - 602 Trafﬁc 2001 ; 2 : 597 – 605 sembles as a ﬂat hexagonal matrix , and curvature is caused by the introduction of pentagons into the matrix ( 45 ) . As the vesicle is formed , the edge of the bud becomes more deeply invaginated . Since clathrin by itself can assemble into cages that have a variable diameter , and all synaptic vesicles are of a uniform size , speciﬁc factors must regulate the size of syn - aptic vesicles . Studies on the C . elegans gene unc - 11 show that the clathrin adaptor protein AP180 is responsible for regulating synaptic vesicle size ( 21 ) . In the wild - type , synaptic vesicles are 30nm in diameter , whereas in unc - 11 mutants , the vesicle diameter is increased to 40nm . These large vesicles occasionally ap - pear to be docked at the plasma membrane , providing evi - dence that they are bona ﬁde synaptic vesicles and not a recycling intermediate . Mutants in Drosophila AP180 also ex - hibit an increase in synaptic vesicle size , with a correspond - ing increase in quantal size ( which reﬂects the amount of neurotransmitter in a single synaptic vesicle ) indicating that these large vesicles are competent for release and are thus bona ﬁde synaptic vesicles ( 48 ) . The requirement for AP180 in regulating vesicle size is some - what surprising , since a more critical role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis was expected . AP180 can recruit clathrin to lipo - some membranes , and promote assembly of clathrin cages in the absence of AP2 and under conditions that do not sup - port clathrin self - assembly . These clathrin cages show a tight size distribution of 60 – 90nm ( 49 ) . Furthermore , AP180 binds to AP2 , and together they increase the rate at which a clathrin lattice forms on a membrane ( 50 ) . However , the phenotype observed in unc - 11 mutants indicates that ani - mals defective for AP180 are still capable of endocytosing plasma membrane . This suggests that AP180 does not play an essential role in clathrin recruitment in C . elegans , but may instead regulate the angle between clathrin triskelions at the vertices . Alternatively , AP180 may be required for AP2 - me - diated endocytosis . In the absence of AP180 , alternative pathways such as kiss and run ( 2 ) or AP3 - mediated endo - cytosis ( 51 ) may predominate , and these mechanisms yield vesicles of different size . However , the experiments de - scribed below indicate that bypass mechanisms for AP2 - me - diated endocytosis cannot function in all tissues . The role of clathrin and the adaptor complex have been probed in C . elegans using RNAi ( 25 ) . Elimination of clathrin heavy chain resulted in lethality , as might be expected , since AP1 , AP2 and AP3 - mediated budding would all be elimin - ated . In addition , interference of the AP2 complex subunits , a - adaptin , and b - adaptin , also caused lethality and blocked receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 25 ) . Interestingly , elimin - ation of the other subunits of the AP2 complex , m 2 and s 2 , did not disrupt receptor - mediated endocytosis . In addition , these animals are viable , suggesting one of two things : either m 2 and s 2 may not be ubiquitously required for clathrin - me - diated endocytosis in C . elegans , or alternatively , m 2 and s 2 may be functionally redundant with other m and s subunits , such as those in AP1 or AP3 complexes . Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis in C . elegans Vesicle ﬁssion During the ﬁssion step of synaptic vesicle recycling , the bud - ded vesicle is cleaved from the plasma membrane . A collar can be seen around the constricted neck of the coated ves - icle , composed of the large GTPase , dynamin ( 5 ) . These en - docytic intermediate structures are rarely observed in normal synapses , but can be observed when endocytosis is blocked prior to ﬁssion . Temperature sensitive mutations in the GTPase domain of shibire , the gene encoding dynamin in Drosophila , lead to a reversible block in vesicle recycling , with the appearance of collared endocytic intermediates in the plasma membrane ( 52 ) . It has been proposed that dyna - min forms a collar around the endocytosed vesicle ; the collar is constricted upon GTP hydrolysis , thereby releasing the ves - icle from the plasma membrane ( 53 ) , although there are alternatives to the ‘pinchase’ model ( 54 ) . In C . elegans , dynamin function is critical for viability ( 18 ) . Temperature - sensitive mutations in the sole C . elegans dyna - min , dyn - 1 result in a lethal phenotype when grown at the restrictive temperature of 25 (cid:190) C . Moreover , animals grown at the permissive temperature but placed at the restrictive tem - perature for 20min become uncoordinated , and have pha - ryngeal pumping , defecation , and egg - laying defects . These data suggest one of two possibilities : the dynamin protein made in dyn - 1 ( ky51 ) mutants is functional at low tempera - tures but defective at high temperatures , or alternatively en - docytosis in C . elegans is a temperature - sensitive process . From studies on the C . elegans Eps15 protein , it appears that the latter is at least partially true . The Eps15 protein is encoded by the ehs - 1 gene ( eps15 homologous sequence - 1 ) in C . elegans ( 28 ) . Null alleles of the ehs - 1 gene result in a reversible temperature - sensitive defect in synaptic vesicle recycling . At the restrictive tem - perature of 30 (cid:190) C , ehs - 1 mutants are depleted of synaptic vesicles as revealed by electron microscopy . The uncoordin - ated behavioral phenotype of ehs - 1 mutants is similar to the phenotype observed in the temperature - sensitive dyn - 1 mu - tant , suggesting that these proteins might function in the same pathway . Moreover , direct physical interactions be - tween mammalian dynamin and Eps15 were demonstrated using pulldown experiments from cell lysates , coimmunopre - cipitation in cell culture , and afﬁnity puriﬁcation from hetero - logously expressed proteins ( 28 ) . Genetic interactions were also observed : most dyn - 1 ehs - 1 double - mutant animals are dead at 18 (cid:190) C , which is normally a permissive temperature for both the dyn - 1 and ehs - 1 mutants . Rare surviving animals are severely uncoordinated and slow growing . Together , these results suggest that Eps15 functions with dynamin dur - ing endocytosis ; in particular , Eps15 may stabilize endo - cytosis at high temperatures . Such stabilization may be im - portant because lipid ﬂuidity may be signiﬁcantly altered at high temperature . Vesicle uncoating The ﬁnal stage of synaptic vesicle recycling , uncoating , oc - curs once the vesicle has been released from the plasma 603 Trafﬁc 2001 ; 2 : 597 – 605 membrane . During uncoating , clathrin and clathrin adaptor proteins are rapidly removed from the vesicle membrane . Un - coating must occur before the synaptic vesicle can fuse to other membrane compartments . Two apparently unrelated mechanisms appear to be involved in vesicle uncoating : dis - ruption of protein – protein interactions and release of adaptor proteins from the vesicle membrane . First , dissolution of protein complexes is regulated by the Hsc70 heat shock cognate protein , also known as the un - coating ATPase . Hsc70 is recruited to clathrin - coated vesicles by binding to a DnaJ domain containing protein auxilin . It is thought that the interaction with auxilin serves not only to localize Hsc70 to the coated vesicle , but also to activate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 , leading to the disruption of the clathrin lattice ( 55 – 58 ) . C . elegans in which auxilin has been disrupted by RNAi , are inviable and display an accumulation of membrane - associ - ated clathrin ( 29 ) . Receptor - mediated uptake in the gonad is also disrupted and this phenotype is similar to that of animals depleted for the AP2 adaptor complex ( 25 ) . This endocytic defect is probably caused by a depletion of cytosolic clathrin as it accumulates on vesicles . In auxilin - depleted animals , there is increased ﬂuorescence of clathrin - GFP puncta com - pared to the wild type . This is consistent with clathrin heavy chain accumulating on vesicles in the auxilin - defective ani - mals . Finally , overexpression of the clathrin : : GFP protein in auxilin RNAi - treated worms allows the worms to grow into adults , suggesting that in the auxilin - defective animals , the amount of clathrin is limiting . Adaptor complexes can remain associated with endocytosed vesicles , even following removal of the clathrin coat ( 55 , 59 ) . Lipid composition of the vesicle may play a role in removal of adaptor complexes . As described above , synaptojanin is a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase . Synaptojanin mutants in both C . elegans and mice accumulate clathrin - coated ves - icles ( 19 , 60 ) , whereas coated vesicles are rarely observed at wild - type synapses . This failure in uncoating may be due to stabilization in binding of the clathrin adaptor complex to lipids of the synaptic vesicle . Both the clathrin adaptor protein AP180 and the alpha subunit of the AP2 complex bind to the lipid substrates of synaptojanin ( 47 , 61 ) . Direct hydrolysis of these lipids by synaptojanin may destabilize the association of these clathrin adaptor proteins with the vesicle membrane , causing the vesicle to shed its clathrin coat . Future Contributions from C . elegans We have provided a mere sketch of the molecular mechan - isms of endocytosis at the synapse . Parts of this model are speculative , others are incomplete . What advancements do we anticipate in the near future ? Predictions about the speci - ﬁcs of the model are foolish , particularly in light of the fact that we do not have a complete list of the actors in this Harris et al . drama . However , we can outline the strategies that we be - lieve will unravel the remaining mysteries . In the short term , the strategies described above must be taken to their conclusion . For example , reverse strategies , either using RNAi or targeted deletions , will elucidate the function of other genes known to play a role in endocytosis ( Table1 ) . The heart and soul of C . elegans is genetic el - egance , that is , gene discovery through sophisticated mutant screens . Second - generation screens are already emerging . For example , clever screens using GFP as a marker for endo - cytosis have revealed a large number of genes required for tissue - speciﬁc endocytosis ( 25 , 62 ) . What screens do we en - vision will identify genes involved in synaptic transmission ? First , there are many mutants that we and others have not characterized because their phenotypes have been too subtle to follow in mapping experiments . For example , many of the synaptic transmission mutants identiﬁed in pharmaco - logical screens are not uncoordinated and thus they lack an easily mapped phenotype . In the future , such genes can be identiﬁed using transposons as DNA tags . In particular , mo - bilization of Drosophila transposons in C . elegans will provide a unique tag with which to clone the mutated genes without having to genetically map the mutant phenotypes . Another useful strategy would be to screen for temperature - sensitive mutants . Such mutants will identify viable alleles of genes for which null mutations are lethal . On the other hand , some of these temperature - sensitive mutations may in fact be null mutations , since endocytosis seems to be a temperature - sensitive process , as suggested by the deletion alleles of Eps15 . Finally , suppressor screens will reveal other proteins in this pathway . For example , one expects that mutations in the lipid kinase genes may suppress the defects caused by phosphoinositide accumulation observed in the synaptojanin mutants . But what will happen when all the genes are identiﬁed , what then ? At that point we will need to understand how these proteins interact to function as molecular machines . Resi - dues that interact with other proteins will be identiﬁed by structural studies . Models will arise from these data but they will not be testable using structural data . To test these models , proteins with speciﬁc residue changes must be in - troduced into an organism to test their predicted effects on synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Because the introduction of re - combinant molecules is so straightforward and quick in C . elegans , it is likely that many of these studies will be per - formed in this simple worm . References 1 .
