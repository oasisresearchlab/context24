In contrast , no correlation was found between lipid binding of intrinsic components of the clathrin coat ( AP180 , the AP - 2 subunit (cid:97) - adaptin and clathrin ) and the presence of clathrin - coated pits , suggesting that at least a fraction of these proteins bind to membranes ( either directly or indirectly ) independently and irrespec - tive of coat assembly ( Figure 5d ) . Coated Tubules and Buds Can Form in the Absence of Nucleotides Brain cytosol produced a massive tubulation of lipo - somes even in the absence of nucleotides . Tubules formed underthese conditions were somewhat different from those formed in the presence of ATP and GTP (cid:103) S ( Figure 6 , compare fields [ a ] and [ d ] ) . They were slightly variable in diameter , and their wall was only sparsely decorated by dynamin rings . A morphology similar to that produced by cytosol alone was observed with liposomes incubated with cytosol plus ATP ( data not shown ) . Surprisingly , tubules withapatchy irregularcoat were observed even in the presence of ATP plus GTP ( 200 (cid:109) M ) ( Figure 6c ) or in liposomes that had been incu - bated for 10 min with brain cytosol , ATP , and 200 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S , and then supplemented with an excess of GTP ( 10 - fold molar excess to GTP (cid:103) S ) for an additional 10 min to reverse the effect of GTP (cid:103) S ( data not shown ) . Previous studies of synaptic membranes had shown that tubules did not form if 200 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S was replaced with 200 (cid:109) M GTP ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) . However , tubules that resemble in morphology the tubules generated by brain cytosol on liposomes in the presence of GTP were previously described at synapses fixed in situ ( Heuser and Miledi , 1971 ; Lovas , 1971 ; Hama and Saito , 1977 ) , and a few examples of such tubules can be observed in intact synaptosomes ( Figure 6e ) . The connection of these tubules to clathrin had suggested their endocytic nature ( Heuser andMiledi , 1971 ; Lovas , 1971 ; Hama and Saito , 1977 ) .

This findingcan be explained eitherby clathrin - indepen - ated endocytosis can assemble on liposomes . Thus , the deformation of a lipid membrane by coat proteins does dent tubule formation or by dissociation of the clathrin coat after tubules have started to grow . We therefore not require the presence of protein anchors within the lipid bilayer .
