Here , we have studied the compartmentalization of NAEs and 2 - AG into lipid raft fractions isolated from the caveolin - 1 - lacking microglial cell line BV - 2 , following vehicle or cannabidiol ( CBD ) treatment . Results were compared with those from the caveolin - 1 - positive F - 11 cell line . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH BV - 2 cells were incubated with CBD or vehicle . Cells were fractionated using a detergent - free continuous OptiPrep density gradient . Lipids in fractions were quantiﬁed using HPLC / MS / MS . Proteins were measured using Western blot . KEY RESULTS BV - 2 cells were devoid of caveolin - 1 . Lipid rafts were isolated from BV - 2 cells as conﬁrmed by co - localization with ﬂotillin - 1 and sphingomyelin . Small amounts of cannabinoid CB 1 receptors were found in lipid raft fractions . After incubation with CBD , levels and distribution in lipid rafts of 2 - AG , N - arachidonoyl ethanolamine ( AEA ) , and N - oleoyl ethanolamine ( OEA ) were not changed . Conversely , the levels of the saturated N - stearoyl ethanolamine ( SEA ) and N - palmitoyl ethanolamine ( PEA ) were elevated in lipid raft fractions . In whole cells with growth medium , CBD treatment increased AEA and OEA time - dependently , while levels of 2 - AG , PEA and SEA did not change . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Whereas levels of 2 - AG were not affected by CBD treatment , the distribution and levels of NAEs showed signiﬁcant changes . Among the NAEs , the degree of acyl chain saturation predicted the compartmentalization after CBD treatment suggesting a shift in cell signalling activity .

The term membrane raft ( interchangeable with lipid raft ) is used to convey the importance of both lipids and proteins in membrane raft formation and function ( Pike , 2006 ) . Lipid rafts are involved in many functions including intracellular signalling , cellular polarity , molecular sorting , membrane transport and endocytosis ( Moffett et al . , 2000 ; Gaus et al . , 2003 ; Chini and Parenti , 2004 ; Wilson et al . , 2004 ; Lajoie and Nabi , 2010 ) . Caveolae are a subtype of membrane / lipid rafts with electron microscopically visible plasma membrane invaginations . The protein caveolin - 1 is a necessary ( but not sufﬁcient ) component for the formation of caveolae in non - muscle tissues ( see Lajoie and Nabi , 2010 ) . Caveolar mem - brane rafts are involved in lipid molecule endocytosis , transcytosis , transport , trafﬁcking and efﬂux ( Fielding and Fielding , 1995 ; 1997 ; Czarny et al . , 1999 ; Sharma et al . , 2003 ; Luo et al . , 2010 ) . Other membrane / lipid raft subtypes are less well characterized and include non - caveolar lipid rafts of different types ( Lajoie and Nabi , 2010 ) . Lipid raft / caveolae have been proposed to compartmen - talize the endocannabinoid signalling machinery in several cellular systems ( Keren and Sarne , 2003 ; McFarland et al . , 2004 ; 2008 Bari et al . , 2005a , b ; 2006 ; 2008 ; McFarland and Barker , 2005 ; Sarnataro et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Oddi et al . , 2007 ; Placzek et al . , 2008 ; Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2009 ) . Speciﬁcally , several lines of evidence support an association of the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor ( nomenclature follows Alexander et al . , 2011 ) with lipid raft / caveolae includ - ing : ( i ) CB 1 receptor C - terminal acylation domain is required for proper interactions with lipid raft - associated G proteins ( Mukhopadhyay et al . , 1999 ; Barnett - Norris et al . , 2005 ; Fay et al . , 2005 ; Xie and Chen , 2005 ) ; ( ii ) CB 1 receptor internal - ization in human embryonic kidney 293 cells - CB 1 transfected cells that occurs via both caveolae and clathrin - coated pits ( Keren and Sarne , 2003 ) ; ( iii ) increased CB 1 receptor binding and signalling following cholesterol depletion in C6 glioma cells ( Bari et al . , 2005a , b ; 2006 ) ; ( iv ) CB 1 receptor association with lipid raft fractions / non - lipid raft fractions in MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells which depends on receptor activation / antagonism ( Sarnataro et al . , 2005 ; 2006 ) ; and ( v ) CB 1 receptor localization within lipid rafts in human endothelial cells , and CB 1 receptor co - localization with caveolin - 1 in C6 glioma cells ( Bari et al . , 2006 ; 2008 ) . N - arachidonoyl glycerol ( 2 - AG ) and N - arachidonoyl etha - nolamine ( AEA ) , two major endocannabinoids that interact with CB 1 and CB 2 receptors have been characterized in lipid rafts ( Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ) . We previously investigated their compartmentalization in caveolin - 1 - expressing F - 11 cells ( a dorsal root ganglion - like cell line ) . We showed that membrane / lipid rafts ( rich in caveolin - 1 , ﬂotillin - 1 and lipid markers ) compartmentalize the biochemical machinery for the production of 2 - AG that includes the 2 - AG precursor arachidonoyl - containing diacyl glycerol , and the synthetic enzyme diacyl glycerol lipase a ( DGL a ; Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ) . Additionally , endogenous AEA and one of its biosyn - thetic enzymes , N - acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospho - lipase D ( NAPE - PLD ) were found in lipid raft as well as in non - raft fractions ( Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ) . A similar trend was observed following incubation with exogenous deute - rium labelled AEA [ ( 2 H 8 ) - AEA ] . On the other hand , deuterium labelled arachidonic acid , a direct metabolite of [ 2 H 8 ] - AEA , was localized mostly to non - lipid raft fractions consistent with the theory of caveolar - mediated endocytosis of AEA ( McFarland et al . , 2004 ; McFarland and Barker , 2005 ) . AEA belongs to a larger family of N - acyl ethanolamines ( NAE ) such as the monounsaturated [ ( 18 : 1 ) - containing acyl chain ] N - oleoyl ethanolamine ( OEA ) , and the saturated [ ( 18 : 0 ) and ( 16 : 0 ) - containing acyl chain ] , N - stearoyl ethano - lamine ( SEA ) and N - palmitoyl ethanolamine ( PEA ) respec - tively . NAEs were shown to increase during brain disease , and to produce anti - inﬂammatory effects through different mechanisms ( see Franklin et al . , 2003 ; Hansen , 2010 ) . OEA was shown to interact with the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor a ( PPAR a ) and the orphan G protein coupled receptor , GPR119 . PEA was shown to interact with PPAR a , GPR119 and GPR55 ( Fu et al . , 2005 ; Lo Verme et al . , 2005a , b ; Overton et al . , 2006 , 2008 ; O’Sullivan et al . , 2007 ; Godlewski et al . , 2009 ) . SEA interacts with a yet uni - dentiﬁed target to modulate cellular signalling ( Maccarrone et al . , 2002 ; Hansen , 2010 ) . The compartmentalization of OEA and SEA in lipid rafts has not yet been investigated . The mechanisms leading to 2 - AG and NAE metabolism differ between cell types , reﬂecting differential expression of gene products , enzymes , lipid membrane composition and trafﬁcking mechanisms . In this study , we characterize the membrane compartmentalization of 2 - AG and NAEs into lipid rafts in the BV - 2 microglial cell line , which we found to be devoid of caveolin - 1 . BV - 2 microglial cells express CB 1 and CB 2 receptors , the lysophosphatidylinositol / cannabinoid receptor GPR55 and the putative abnormal - cannabidiol receptor GPR18 ( Pietr et al . , 2009 ; McHugh et al . , 2010 ; Stella , 2010 ) . In addition , they express the enzyme a - b - hydrolase domain 6 ( ABHD6 ) that controls the accumulation of 2 - AG and the efﬁcacy of this compound at cannabinoid receptors ( Marrs et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , PEA was shown to be metabolized via a URB602 - sensitive enzyme of yet unknown identity , and AEA through fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) in BV - 2 cells ( Muccioli et al . , 2007 ; Muccioli and Stella , 2008 ) . Our group recently reported that the non - psychoactive plant cannabinoid , cannabidiol ( CBD ) inhibits pro - inﬂammatory pathways in lipopolysaccharide - activated BV - 2 cells ( Kozela et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , our gene array analysis studies indicate that CBD exerts immunosuppressive effects by regulating stress response genes ( Juknat et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we compared the compartmentalization of 2 - AG and NAEs in lipid raft fractions , as well as their levels in whole cells with growth medium , between vehicle and CBD - treated cells . We show that BV - 2 cells do not express caveolin - 1 mRNA or protein , and thus , are devoid of the caveolar - membrane / lipid raft subtype . The compartmentalization of 2 - AG in these cells was generally similar to F - 11 cells ( which express caveolin - 1 ) ; however , while the membrane / lipid rafts in F - 11 cells were well separated from the non - raft fractions by their density proﬁle ( Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ) , BV - 2 lipid rafts and non - lipid raft fractions showed a much closer density . The CB 1 receptor is localized mostly to non - lipid raft fractions with small amounts present in lipid raft fractions . In addition , we show that following CBD treatment , the levels of 2 - AG were not affected in membrane / lipid raft fractions or whole cells BJP 2 - AG and NAE compartmentalization into lipid rafts British Journal of Pharmacology ( 2012 ) 165 2436 – 2449 2437 with growth medium . The levels of AEA and OEA increased signiﬁcantly in whole cells with growth medium , while the levels of PEA and SEA increased signiﬁcantly in membrane / lipid rafts fractions . Methods Cell culture The BV - 2 murine microglial cell line , originally generated by E . Blasi ( University of Perugia , Perugia , Italy ; Blasi et al . , 1990 ) , was kindly provided by Prof E . J . Choi from the Korea University ( Seoul , Korea ) . Cells were grown under 5 % CO 2 at 37°C in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing high glucose ( Gibco - BRL , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) supplemented with 5 % heat - inactivated foetal bovine serum , streptomycin ( 100 m g·mL - 1 ) and penicillin ( 100 U·mL - 1 ) ( Biological Indus - tries Ltd , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) . Cells were used up to passage 25 . Lipid analysis from whole BV - 2 cells and media BV - 2 cells were grown for 24 h on 10 cm plates in growth medium . Media was replaced with 5 mL fresh growth medium 1 h before treatment . BV - 2 cells were then treated with either vehicle ( ethanol 0 . 1 % ) or CBD ( 10 m M ) . Cells together with media were scraped into 7 mL 100 % HPLC - grade methanol . Whole cells with growth medium were col - lected from independent plates at four time points ( 10 , 30 , 60 and 210 min ; n = 3 per condition ; except for vehicle at 210 min , n = 2 ) . The solution was then vortexed and centri - fuged at 200 ¥ g for 5 min . Internal standards were added to supernatant samples and HPLC - grade water was added to make a 75 % aqueous solution . Lipids were then extracted as previously described ( Bradshaw et al . , 2006 ) . Brieﬂy , 500 mg C8 Bond Elut solid phase extraction columns ( Varian , Harbor city , CA , USA ) were conditioned with 5 mL HPLC - grade methanol followed by 3 . 0 mL HPLC - grade water . The 75 % aqueous solutions were loaded onto separate columns , which were then washed with 3 mL water . Two sequential elutions ( 1 . 5 mL 50 % , and 2 mL 100 % methanol ) were collected for mass spectrometric analysis . Samples were dried down by speed vac and reconstituted in 400 m L 100 % HPLC - grade methanol for lipid analysis . Membrane fractionation Procedures for fractionation were adapted from the method of Macdonald and Pike ( 2005 ) . Cells were plated 24 h before the experiment . On the day of the experiment , cells from four 150 mm plates for each experimental condition were washed once with PBS and scraped into a total of 25 mL of 4°C base buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , 250 mM sucrose , pH 7 . 8 ) containing 1 mM calcium chloride and 1 mM magnesium chloride . Cells were centrifuged in a polystyrene tube at 200 ¥ g for 7 min at 4°C . The pellet was re - suspended in 1 . 0 mL of base buffer containing calcium and magnesium , and protease inhibitors were added ( 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride , 20 m g·mL - 1 leupeptin , 1 m g·mL - 1 aprotinin and 2 m M pepsta - tin ) . Cells were then lysed by passage through a 27 g ¥ 3 ″ needle , 20 times , and centrifuged at 1000 ¥ g for 10 min at 4°C . The post - nuclear supernatant was transferred to a new tube , the pellet was re - suspended in base buffer containing calcium chloride , magnesium chloride and protease inhibi - tors , and the procedure was repeated . The 2 mL post - nuclear supernatants were combined and 50 % OptiPrep ( Axis Shield , Dundee , UK ) in base buffer was added to give a 4 mL solution of 25 % OptiPrep . An 8 mL continuous density gradient of 20 % – 0 % OptiPrep in base buffer was formed on top of the 4 mL 25 % OptiPrep solution in Ultra - Clear TM ( 14 ¥ 89 mm ) centrifuge tubes . The gradient was centrifuged using an SW - 41 swinging bucket rotor ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA , USA ) for 90 min at 52 000 ¥ g at 4°C . 16 fractions of 0 . 75 mL were collected from each gradient . To conﬁrm our results , we used a second fractionation method according to Ostrom et al . ( 2001 ) which was modi - ﬁed from the original method of Song et al . ( 1996 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were scraped into 500 mM sodium bicarbonate , pH 11 ( including protease inhibitors ) . Cells were then homogenized 10 times with a Dounce homogenizer , then were polytroned 10 s ¥ 3 times , and sonicated 20 s ¥ 3 times . The 2 mL homo - genate was mixed with 2 mL of 90 % sucrose ( containing MES 25 mM , and NaCl 150 mM ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 45 % sucrose . The 4 mL homogenate was placed in the bottom of an Ultra - Clear TM ( 14 ¥ 89 mm ) centrifuge tube . On top of the homogenate were placed 4 mL 35 % sucrose ( containing MES 25 mM , NaCl 150 mM , Na 2 CO 3 250 mM ) , and 4 mL of 5 % sucrose in the same buffer to form a discontinuous gradient . The gradient was centrifuged using an SW - 41 swinging bucket rotor for 20 h at 160 000 ¥ g at 4°C . Eleven fractions of 1 mL were collected from each gradient . Mass spectrometric analysis of lipids in fractions For lipid analysis , 0 . 6 mL of each fraction was removed and 2 mL of HPLC - grade methanol were added . [ 2 H 8 ] - AEA ( 200 pmol ) was added to each sample and diluted with HPLC - grade water to make a 75 % aqueous solution . Lipids were extracted as previously described ( Bradshaw et al . , 2006 ) . Brieﬂy , 500 mg C8 Bond Elut solid phase extraction columns ( Varian ) were conditioned with 5 mL HPLC - grade methanol , followed by 3 . 0 mL HPLC water . The 75 % aqueous solutions containing the fractions were loaded onto separate columns , which were then washed with 20 mL water . Five sequential elutions ( 1 . 5 mL each of 30 , 50 , 85 and 100 % methanol ) were collected for mass spectrometric analysis . As described previ - ously ( Bradshaw et al . , 2006 ) , sample analysis of lipids was carried out as follows . An aliquot of each of the eluates was loaded using a Shimadzu SCL10Avp ( Wilmington , DE , USA ) or an LC Packings Ultimate - 3000 ( Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) autosampler onto a reversed phase Zorbax 2 . 1 ¥ 50 mm C8 column maintained at 40°C . HPLC gradient formation at a ﬂow rate of 200 m L·min - 1 was achieved by a system comprised of a Shimadzu controller and two Shimadzu LC10ADvp pumps or an LC Packings controller and an LPG - 3000 loading pump . Lipid levels in the samples were analysed in multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) mode on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer , using either the API 3000 or the API 4000 ( Applied Biosystems / MDS SCIEX , Foster city , CA , USA ) , with electrospray ionization . Methods for lipid analysis were created and optimized by ﬂow injection of lipid standards . All calculations for quantitation experiments were based on cali - BJP N Rimmerman et al . 2438 British Journal of Pharmacology ( 2012 ) 165 2436 – 2449 bration curves using synthetic standards . The following molecular ion and fragment ion pairs were used to quantify lipids in MRM mode : ( 18 : 0 ) - sphingomyelin 731 . 7 / 184 . 1 ; 2 - AG 379 . 3 / 287 . 3 ; AEA 348 . 2 / 62 . 1 ; PEA 300 . 2 / 62 . 1 ; SEA 328 . 2 / 62 . 1 ; OEA 326 . 2 / 62 . 1 ; CBD 315 . 2 / 193 . 1 . Western blot analysis Membrane components present in gradient fractions were lysed by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , NP - 40 ( EMD Biosciences Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) and Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to a ﬁnal concentra - tion of 0 . 5 , 1 and 1 % respectively . Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min . Laemmli Loading buffer was added to the samples and they were denatured for 3 min at 70°C using a hot water bath . Aliquots of 20 m L from each sample were separated by an 8 % or 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . The membranes were blocked in blocking buffer consisting of TBST [ 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ] with 5 % w / v skim milk . The membranes were washed ﬁve times with TBST and incubated overnight at 4°C in the presence of primary antibody or antibody + blocking peptide in 3 % BSA . The following afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies were used for the Western blot analyses : anti - ﬂotillin - 1 ( 1 : 500 dilution ) , anti - caveolin - 1 ( 1 : 500 dilution ) , anti - transient receptor potential channel V2 ( TRPV2 ; 1 : 500 dilution ) , anti - CB 2 receptor ( 1 : 500 dilution ) , anti - CB 1 receptor ( 1 : 500 dilution ) , anti - b - actin ( 1 : 1000 – 2000 dilution ) and anti - lysosomal - associated mem - brane protein 1 ( LAMP1 ) ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) . The membranes were washed ﬁve times with TBST , and then incubated for 45 – 60 min with either HRP - goat anti - rabbit IgG , HRP - goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 10 000 dilution ) or HRP - rat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 10 000 ) in 5 % milk ( or 3 % BSA for the CB 1 receptor primary antibody ) . The blots were washed ﬁve times and processed using chemiluminescent detection . The detection of CB 1 receptors needed a much longer ﬁlm exposure compared with CB 2 receptors , due to lower levels of the CB 1 receptor protein . Isolation of total RNA , reverse transcription and real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) Primers for mouse caveolin - 1 ( NM _ 007616 . 3 ) and for mouse caveolin - 2 ( NM _ 016900 . 3 ) were designed as assay on demand by Qiagen ( Hilden , Germany ) . The following primers were used for mouse caveolin - 1 , forward AGCTCACATTACAGC TCTGCCCTT , reverse AGTGTCGGCAAGACTGAAGGAGAA ; for caveolin - 2 , forward TTGCGGGTATCCTGTTTGCT , reverse AGTTGCATGCTGACCGATGA ; and for mouse b - microglobulin , forward ATGGGAAGCCGAACATACTG , reverse CAGTCTCAGTGGGGGTGAAT . RNA was extracted using the Versagene RNA puriﬁcation kit ( Gentra , Minneapo - lis , MN , USA ) , and RNA samples ( 2 m g ) were reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit from Qiagen including DNase treatment of contaminating genomic DNA . Expression of caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 2 mRNAs were deter - mined by qPCR , using b - microglobulin as a normalizing gene , as previously described ( Butovsky et al . , 2006 ) . Normal and mock reversed transcribed samples ( in the absence of reverse transcriptase ) , as well as no template controls ( total mix without cDNA ) , were run for each of the examined mRNA’s . qPCR reactions were subjected to an initial step of 15 min at 95°C to activate the HotStar Taq DNA polymerase , followed by 40 cycles consisting of 15 s at 94°C , 30 s at 60°C and 30 s at 72°C . Fluorescence was measured at the end of each elonga - tion step . Data were analysed using the Rotor - Gene software ( Corbett Life Sciences , Mortlake , Australia ) and a threshold cycle value C t was calculated from the exponential phase of each PCR sample . Amounts of mRNAs were calculated and expressed in relative units of SYBR Green ﬂuorescence . Data analysis Data are shown as means (cid:2) SEM . Differences in lipid levels were assessed by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference ( LSD ) post hoc test or Bon - ferroni post hoc test ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) , as speciﬁed in the Figure legends . Differences were considered signiﬁcant for P < 0 . 05 . Materials [ 2 H 8 ] - N - arachidonoyl ethanolamine [ ( 2 H 8 ) - AEA ] , AEA , PEA , SEA and 2 - AG were purchased from Cayman Chemical ( Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) . CBD was received from NIDA . Sphingomy - elin standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc ( Alabaster , AL , USA ) . High - performance liquid chromatogra - phy ( HPLC ) grade methanol , acetonitrile and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from VWR international ( Plainview , NY , USA ) and HPLC - grade water was obtained using a MilliQ Gradient apparatus from Millipore ( Milford , MA , USA ) . HPLC - grade acetic acid and ammonium acetate were pur - chased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The afﬁnity puriﬁed rabbit polyclonal antibodies L15 - CB 1 , and CT t - CB 2 were provided by Dr Ken Mackie , Bloomington , IN , USA and used with their respective blocking peptides . The TRPV2 rabbit polyclonal antibody ( ACC - 039 ) targeting an extracellular epitope was purchased from Alomone ( Jerusa - lem , Israel ) and was used with the supplied blocking peptide . Mouse monoclonal antibody for caveolin - 1 ( C37120 ) , and mouse ﬂotillin - 1 ( 312 – 428 ) were purchased from BD Trans - duction Laboratories ( San Diego , CA , USA ) . Mouse mono - clonal antibody against b - actin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , and rat mono - clonal anti - LAMP - 1 ( 1D4B ) was purchased from Developmen - tal studies hybridoma bank ( NIH ) . Results Localization of lipid raft markers BV - 2 cells were fractionated using a continuous ( 0 – 20 % OptiPrep ) , detergent - free , density gradient ( Macdonald and Pike , 2005 ) . The distribution of the lipid raft marker [ 18 : 0 ] - sphingomyelin in BV - 2 cells ( Figure 1A ) was equivalent to the distribution of the membrane / lipid rafts protein marker ﬂotillin - 1 ( Figure 1B ) . Note that the lipid rafts isolated from BV - 2 cells ( fractions 7 – 10 ) are distributed differently on the continuous OptiPrep density gradient when compared with lipid rafts isolated from F - 11 cells ( fractions 10 – 13 ; Rimmer - man et al . , 2008 ) . In the BV - 2 cells fraction 6 represents an interface fraction where some mixing of lipid rafts and other cellular components occurs . The phenomena that mem - branes from different cell lines have different average densi - BJP 2 - AG and NAE compartmentalization into lipid rafts British Journal of Pharmacology ( 2012 ) 165 2436 – 2449 2439 ties , resulting in lipid rafts and other membranes to be recovered at slightly shifted positions on the density gradi - ent , was previously reported ( Macdonald and Pike , 2005 ) . Figure 1C shows a comparison of the distribution of the lipid raft marker [ 18 : 0 ] - sphingomyelin in both cell lines . b - actin , a cytoskeletal protein associated with both raft and non - raft fractions was observed in high concentrations in non - lipid raft fractions , and found in low levels in lipid raft fractions ( Figure 1B ) . The lysosomal marker LAMP - 1 was found in the lipid raft fractions as previously reported ( Figure 1B ; Zhai et al . , 2009 ) . The membrane raft protein caveolin - 1 , which was shown to be associated with the caveolae lipid raft subtype and necessary for their formation ( Drab et al . , 2001 ) was absent from BV - 2 cells ( Figure 1D ) . Caveolin - 1 was present in CHO cells ( Figure 1D ) , F11 cells ( Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ) and human endothelial cells ( data not shown ) . qPCR analysis demonstrated that BV - 2 cells were negative for caveolin - 1 mRNA ( no reaction product was obtained after 40 PCR cycles ; mouse primary astrocytes were used as positive control ) . BV - 2 cells were found to express caveolin - 2 mRNA ( reaction product appeared after 22 cycles ) . Compartmentalization of endocannabinoids in BV - 2 cells 2 - AG levels in control cells were highest in the lipid raft fractions ( 6 – 9 ; Figure 2A ) as previously shown by us for the F - 11 cells , albeit with a general leftward shift of lipid raft fractions on the density gradient when compared with F - 11 cells ( Figure 2B ; Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ) . The other endocan - nabinoid , AEA , was present in both lipid raft and non - lipid raft fractions ( Figure 2C ) . Owing to the low levels of AEA , it was not possible to detect it in all of the fractions .

BJP 2 - AG and NAE compartmentalization into lipid rafts British Journal of Pharmacology ( 2012 ) 165 2436 – 2449 2441 non - lipid rafts and lipid rafts was veriﬁed by a second frac - tionation method ( Song et al . , 1996 ; Ostrom et al . , 2001 ) which showed similar results ( Figure 2E ) , i . e . , the presence of ﬂotillin - 1 , LAMP - 1 , small amounts of CB 1 receptor and lack of caveolin - 1 in lipid rafts isolated from BV - 2 cells . Three NAEs : OEA , PEA and SEA showed a distribution similar to that of 2 - AG . Speciﬁcally , OEA and PEA levels were highest in the interface fraction 6 and in the lipid raft frac - tions 7 – 9 ( their levels were lower in fractions 1 – 5 and 10 – 16 ( Figures 3A , B , P < 0 . 05 , n = 3 , one - way ANOVA , Fisher’s LSD post hoc ) . SEA was highest in interface fraction 6 which was signiﬁcantly different from fractions 1 – 4 and 10 – 16 ( Figures 3C , P < 0 . 05 , n = 3 , one - way ANOVA , Fisher’s LSD post hoc ) . Compartmentalization of endocannabinoids following treatment with CBD Treatment with CBD ( 10 m M ) for 3 h did not change the distribution pattern of the lipid raft marker [ 18 : 0 ] - sphingomyelin , or protein marker ﬂotillin - 1 ( Figure 4A , C ) . CBD was localized to interface fraction 6 and to a lesser degree to lipid raft fraction 7 ( Figure 4B ) . The distribution of b - actin , LAMP - 1 , CB 1 , CB 2 and , TRPV2 was not affected by CBD ( Figure 4C ) . Similarly , levels and distribution of 2 - AG and AEA were equivalent to vehicle - treated cells ( Figure 5A , B ) . However , following CBD treatment , the level of OEA in lipid rafts was not increased ( Figure 6A ) , whereas the satu - rated NAEs , PEA and SEA were signiﬁcantly increased in lipid raft fractions , demonstrating a shift towards the lighter frac - tions ( Figure 6B , C ) . In order to investigate the kinetics of the CBD - induced changes in 2 - AG and NAEs levels , cells were incubated with vehicle or CBD and analysed for lipid content ( including growth medium ) at different time points ( 10 , 30 , 60 , and 210 min ) . 2 - AG levels in whole cells + growth medium did not change following CBD treatment ( Figure 7A ) . Conversely , AEA levels were signiﬁcantly increased in whole cells with growth medium at 60 and 210 min compared with vehicle - treated cells ( Figure 7B ) . OEA levels were also signiﬁcantly increased in whole cells with growth medium at 60 and 210 min compared with vehicle - treated cells ( Figure 7C ) , whereas PEA and SEA levels were not markedly increased ( Figure 7D , E ) . Discussion Microglia are resident macrophages that serve as early host defence against pathogens in the CNS . Chronic activation of microglial cells seems to be a major factor in the development of neuroinﬂammation and contributes to neuronal damage and pathology associated with neurodegeneration ( Farooqui et al . , 2007 ) . The murine BV - 2 cell line is a useful model of microglial cells ( Blasi et al . , 1990 ; Bocchini et al . , 1992 ) , and we recently showed that CBD inhibits the anti - inﬂammatory response and alters gene expression of stress genes in these cells ( Kozela et al . , 2010 ; Juknat et al . , 2012 ) .

Compartmentalization of 2 - AG and NAEs in membrane domains is not well characterized , and lipid raft / caveolae are emerging as important domains involved in their signal transduction ( McFarland et al . , 2004 ; 2008 ; Bari et al . , 2005a , b ; 2006 ; 2008 ; McFarland and Barker , 2005 ; Sarnataro et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Oddi et al . , 2007 ; Placzek et al . , 2008 ; Rim - merman et al . , 2008 ; Yates and Barker , 2009 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2010 ) . We previously investigated the compartmental - ization of endocannabinoid signalling in F - 11 cells which served as a model of peripheral neurons . Here , we report that the lipid rafts of F - 11 cells and of BV - 2 cells show different densities , and appear in slightly different locations on the gradient ( using identical density gradient methodology ) . Lipid rafts in the F - 11 cells are well separated from non - lipid raft fractions ( forming two separate peaks ) . In contrast , BV - 2 lipid raft fractions exhibit a higher density as evident by the localization of lipid raft markers , ﬂotillin - 1 and sphingomy - elin . The fact that membranes from different cells exhibit altered average densities has been previously reported ( Mac - donald and Pike , 2005 ) . Differences in protein expression and lipid composition may explain these differences . Indeed , we ﬁnd that BV - 2 cells , in contrast to F - 11 cells , are devoid of caveolin - 1 . Caveolin - 1 , which is necessary for the formation of caveolae , was reported to modulate cholesterol transport ( Murata et al . , 1995 ; Ikonen and Parton , 2000 ) . Pike et al .

Such differences in protein lipid content ( e . g . caveolin - 1 and cho - lesterol ) may contribute to the density differences observed between F - 11 and BV - 2 lipid rafts . Compartmentalization of 2 - AG in BV - 2 lipid rafts In F - 11 cells , endogenous 2 - AG was concentrated in lipid raft fractions , where its levels were signiﬁcantly higher than in any other fraction . The non - lipid raft fractions contained much lower levels of 2 - AG . A similar phenomenon was observed in the BV - 2 cells . Incubation of BV - 2 cells with CBD did not change the distribution or levels of 2 - AG between fractions . Whole cells with growth medium levels were also not affected by the CBD treatment , and the synthetic enzyme DGL a was below our detection limit using Western blot analysis . To conclude , 2 - AG has a high afﬁnity for lipid rafts in two cell lines , and CBD did not affect 2 - AG metabolism or synthesis in BV - 2 cells . Compartmentalization of NAEs in BV - 2 lipid rafts We previously investigated the compartmentalization of AEA in F - 11 fractions and found that AEA was present in signiﬁ - cant levels in both lipid raft and non - lipid raft fractions . Using deuterium - labelled AEA , we determined that deuterium - labeled free arachidonic acid , a direct metabolic product of AEA hydrolysis , was found in non - lipid raft frac - tions . We postulated that AEA was endocytosed and trafﬁcked to be hydrolysed in non - lipid raft FAAH - containing mem - branes . This is consistent with the proposed theory of lipid raft / caveolae - mediated AEA endocytosis ( McFarland and Barker , 2005 ) . AEA levels in several of the BV - 2 membrane fractions were below our detection limit . Wherever AEA was detectable , signiﬁcant levels were measured in both lipid rafts and non - lipid raft fractions ( similar to AEA distribution in F - 11 cells ) . Remarkably , AEA levels in whole cells with growth medium were signiﬁcantly increased following CBD treat - ment in a time - dependent manner . Because the levels of AEA in membrane fractions cannot account for these changes , we hypothesize that excess AEA production following CBD treat - ment is released into the growth medium . The CB 1 receptor was previously compartmentalized in lipid raft / caveolae membranes in several cellular systems ( Keren and Sarne , 2003 ; Bari et al . , 2005b ; 2006 ; 2008 ; Sarna - taro et al . , 2005 ; 2006 ) . In BV - 2 cell fractions , we observed compartmentalization of CB 1 receptors mostly to non - lipid raft membranes . Using two different fractionation methods we show that only small amounts of CB 1 receptors are local - ized to lipid rafts .

This association may explain apparent differences in lipid raft localization of CB 1 receptors between cell types . Consistent with previous reports , CB 2 receptors did not com - partmentalize in lipid rafts ( Bari et al . , 2006 ; Rimmerman et al . , 2008 ) . Levels of the monounsaturated N - acyl ethanolamine derivative OEA showed a similar trend to AEA . OEA levels in the membrane fractions showed a slight , non - signiﬁcant increase following CBD treatment . However , OEA levels in whole cells with growth medium were signiﬁcantly increased following CBD incubation in a time - dependent manner . The accumulation of AEA and OEA in whole cells with growth medium following CBD treatment , suggests that CBD is inhibiting their uptake and / or hydrolysis . Although AEA uptake has been extensively investigated , not much is known about the uptake of OEA ( Di Marzo et al . , 1994 ; Beltramo et al . , 1997 ; Bisogno et al . , 1997 ; 2001b ; Jacobsson and Fowler , 2001 ; Fowler and Jacobsson , 2002 ; McFarland and Barker , 2005 ; Hermann et al . , 2006 ; Thors et al . , 2007 ; Placzek et al . , 2008 ; Kaczocha et al . , 2006 ; 2009 ; Oddi et al . , 2008 ; 2009 ; Maccarrone et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , the mechanisms of NAE hydrolysis have been determined ( Cravatt et al . , 1996 ) . In this context , CBD was previously shown to inhibit AEA uptake and hydrolysis in several systems . For example , CBD inhibited AEA hydrolysis in mouse brain microsomes ( Watanabe et al . , 1996 ) . In addition , CBD inhibited AEA uptake by RBL - 2H3 with K i ~ 11 m M ( Rakhshan et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , Bisogno et al . ( 2001a ) reported that CBD inhib - ited [ 14 C ] - AEA uptake in RBL - 2H3 cells ( IC 50 of 22 m M ) , and [ 14 C ] - AEA hydrolysis in N18TG2 cell membranes ( IC 50 of 27 . 5 m M ) . Different results were reported by Massi et al . ( 2008 ) where CBD stimulated the activity of FAAH , and decreased AEA content in tumors from CBD - treated nude mice , and in U87 human glioma cells . Our results in BV - 2 cells support the reported inhibition by CBD of AEA uptake and / or hydrolysis , and extend it to OEA . Additionally , we showed that following CBD treatment , the levels of the satu - rated NAEs , PEA and SEA signiﬁcantly increased in lipid raft fractions . This is also consistent with an inhibitory effect of CBD on NAE metabolism and the compartmentalization of this accumulation to lipid rafts . We also found that CBD treatment did not affect 2 - AG levels , consistent with the ﬁndings of Marrs et al . ( 2010 ) showing that 2 - AG hydrolysis in intact cells proceeds through the enzyme ABHD6 rather than FAAH . Aside from the effects of CBD on FAAH activity , there may be other mechanisms leading to the increased accumulation of NAEs . For example , we have found that CBD increased , by 90 % , the mRNA level of the enzyme protein tyrosine phosphatase , non receptor 22 ( PTPN22 ) ( Rimmer - man , unpublished experiments ) , which was shown to be involved in AEA synthesis from phospho - AEA in a macroph - age cell line ( Liu et al . , 2006 ) . CBD was previously shown to exert immunosuppressive effects on immune cells in vitro and in vivo ( Ignatowska - Jankowska et al . , 2009 ; Kozela et al . , 2010 ; 2011 ; Ruiz - Valdepenas et al . , 2011 ) . It is not clear whether the immunosuppressive effects of CBD are mediated via the CBD - induced increases in NAEs , and the NAEs differential com - partmentalization . At least for AEA , immunosuppressive effects through the CB 2 receptor have been described ( Cen - cioni et al . , 2010 ; Correa et al . , 2011 ) . Additional research will be needed to determine the contribution of NAEs compart - mentalization to immune function . In conclusion , CBD treatment generally increased NAEs accumulation in BV - 2 cells . The increase in NAE accumula - tion may be explained by inhibition of FAAH and / or NAE uptake , induced by CBD . We report that following CBD treat - ment , NAEs undergo different compartmentalization , depending on the saturation of the fatty acid . The saturated NAEs ( PEA and SEA ) markedly increased in lipid raft fractions , while the unsaturated NAEs ( AEA and OEA ) markedly increased in whole cells with growth medium , probably via release to the medium . Our results support the idea that although NAE levels are controlled by similar enzymatic mechanisms , they compartmentalize and signal via divergent pathways . In addition , we hypothesize that the anti - inﬂammatory effects of CBD may be mediated by the increased accumulation of anti - inﬂammatory NAEs in micro - glial cells .
