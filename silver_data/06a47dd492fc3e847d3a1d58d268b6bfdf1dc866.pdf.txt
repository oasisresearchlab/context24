Keen Kimmel Cancer Institute and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , PA 19107 onvisual arrestins ( arr ) modulate G protein – coupled receptor ( GPCR ) desensitization and internalization and bind to both clathrin ( CL ) and AP - 2 components of the endocytic coated pit ( CP ) . This raises the possibility that endocytosis of some GPCRs may be a consequence of arr - induced de novo CP formation . To directly test this hypothesis , we examined the behavior of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - arr3 in live cells expressing (cid:2) 2 - adrenergic receptors and ﬂuorescent CL . After agonist stimulation , the diffuse GFP - arr3 signal rapidly became punctate and colocalized virtually completely with preexisting CP spots , demonstrating that activated complexes accumulate in previously formed CPs rather than nucleating new CP formation . After arr3 recruitment , CP appeared larger : electron microscopy analysis revealed an increase in both N CP number and in the occurrence of clustered CPs . Mutant arr3 proteins with impaired binding to CL or AP - 2 displayed reduced recruitment to CPs , but were still capable of inducing CP clustering . In contrast , though constitutively present in CPs , the COOH - terminal moiety of arr3 , which contains CP binding sites but lacks receptor binding , did not induce CP clustering . Together , these results indicate that recruitment of functional arr3 – GPCR complexes to CP is necessary to induce clustering . Latrunculin B or 16 (cid:3) C blocked CP rearrangements without affecting arr3 recruitment to CP . These results and earlier studies suggest that discrete CP zones exist on cell surfaces , each capable of support - ing adjacent CPs , and that the cortical actin membrane skeleton is intimately involved with both the maintenance of existing CPs and the generation of new structures . Introduction During clathrin ( CL ) * coated pit ( CP ) – mediated endocytosis , coats form on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane through the assembly of CL triskelia by the tetrameric assem - bly protein ( AP - 2 ) . A potential link between the endocytic pathway and extracellular stimuli is suggested by the ability of several coat proteins to bind phosphoinositides produced by receptor signaling ( Norris et al . , 1995 ; Ye et al . , 1995 ; Gaidarov et al . , 1996 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) and to undergo reversible phosphorylation ( Wilde and Brodsky , 1996 ; Slepnev et al . , 1998 ; Chen et al . , 1999 ; Chu et al . , 1999 ) in response to receptor stimulation . Previous work from our laboratory showed that CPs preferentially form at discrete locations on the cell membrane and exhibit restricted lateral mobility ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999b ) , suggesting that the membrane cytoskeleton may function to anchor the coat assembly machinery . Furthermore , the number and location of these CP formation sites was not affected by increased levels of receptors on the plasma mem - brane ( Santini and Keen , 1996 ; Santini et al . , 1998 ; Warren et al . , 1998 ) . Nevertheless , in some cells , CP formation can be rapidly induced in response to certain stimulants ( e . g . , EGF , NGF , carbachol ) ( Connolly et al . , 1981 , 1984 ; Geisow et al . , 1985 ; Wilde et al . , 1999 ; Beattie et al . , 2000 ) , further suggesting a functional relationship between signal - ing receptors and the endocytic machinery , perhaps at the level of actin - anchored CP formation sites . Many GPCRs have been shown to undergo CL - mediated endocytosis after stimulation , and arrestins ( arr ) ( (cid:2) arr and arr3 , also called (cid:2) arr1 and (cid:2) arr2 , respectively ) ( Attramadal et al . , 1992 ) , through their binding to both CL ( Krupnick et al . , 1997a ) and AP - 2 ( Laporte et al . , 1999 ) , are pivotal in directing and concentrating activated GPCR into CPs for internalization ( Goodman et al . , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 1997 ) . Arr are also thought to play a broader role as scaffolding pro - The online version of this paper contains supplemental material . Address correspondence to James H .

Here we have investigated responses of the endocytic ma - chinery to GPCR activation . We show that the activated GPCR – arr3 complexes do not recruit coat components to form new CPs , but rather undergo endocytosis as a conse - quence of their rapid accumulation in preexisting CPs . However , cells responded to agonist stimulation by increas - ing the number and clustering of their CPs . Remarkably , re - arrangement of the cortical actin membrane skeleton ap - pears to be required to support formation of these clustered CPs . Our results thus provide evidence for the existence of actin - dependent geographically distinct assembly domains on the cell surface which we term “coated pit zones” ( CPZ ) . Results Arr3 is recruited to preexisting CPs upon agonist activation To directly determine whether activated GPCRs induce for - mation of new CPs or accumulate in preexisting structures , we visualized the behavior of both CPs and arr in living cells following agonist stimulation . HEK293 cells expressing DsRed - CL were cotransfected with green fluorescent pro - tein ( GFP ) - arr3 and Flag - tagged (cid:2) 2 - adrenergic receptor ( AR ) . In the absence of agonist , GFP - arr3 was predomi - nantly diffuse ( Fig . 1 A , and frame 1 of Video 1 ) . In con - trast , the DsRed - CL signal , as reported previously ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999b ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ) , was present in punctate endocytic CPs at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 ) and in the perinuclear localization characteristic of the TGN ( Keen et al . , 1981 ) . Within seconds after isoproterenol ( ISO ) addition there was a striking concentration of arr3 signal in punctate spots which colocalized with DsRed - CL signal ( Video 1 , frames 11 – 15 ) . With time , a gradual decrease in the level of diffuse arr3 signal also became apparent ( compare first with last frame of Video 1 ) , consistent with recruitment of arr from a cytosolic pool to the receptor at the plasma membrane . Comparison of the emerging GFP - arr3 spots with the punc - tate DsRed - CL signal marking CPs revealed that virtually all of the arr3 puncta appeared at loci of preexisting CPs ( Fig . 1 , and frames 11 – 30 of Video 1 ) . For example , of 130 arr3 spots detectable 40 s after ISO addition ( frame # 20 ) , 128 ( 98 . 5 % ) appeared at preexisting CP sites ( i . e . , CPs present in frame # 7 ) . In subsequent frames both signals can be seen to disappear together , consistent with internalization of the arr – (cid:2) 2 - AR complex by CP - mediated endocytosis ( Video 1 ) . Similar results were observed in transfected COS1 cells ( un - published data ) . These results provide direct evidence that the endocytic sequence initiated by activation of (cid:2) 2 - AR re - sults in recruitment of arr3 - receptor complexes to preexist - ing CPs .

CP changes are induced by (cid:2) 2 - AR activation In agonist - stimulated live cells we also observed significant changes in the appearance and distribution of plasma membrane CPs ( unpublished data ) , but monitoring live cells over extended periods presents technical difficulties . Accordingly , we used immunostaining to more easily in - vestigate these changes in COS1 cells transiently expressing (cid:2) 2 - AR and arr3 . As expected from the results described above and earlier work ( Goodman et al . , 1996 ; Krupnick et al . , 1997b ) , after ISO stimulation for 5 min arr3 became colocalized with CL ( Fig . 2 A ) . Under these conditions we noted that CPs adopted an altered distribution , with the CL puncta on the plasma membrane appearing both no - ticeably larger and , to some extent , fewer in number com - pared with those of nonexpressing cells in the same field . Because AP - 2 is a structural component of plasma mem - brane CPs but , unlike CL , is not present in the TGN ( Robinson , 1987 ) , we used AP - 2 labeling as a more direct indicator of endocytic CP changes upon agonist treatment . Following ISO stimulation of arr3 - expressing cells , AP - 2 – labeled CPs underwent redistribution similar to that ob - served with CL ( Fig . 2 B ) . Interestingly , we noticed that the AP - 2 spots had become not only larger but also brighter after agonist stimulation , amounting to a 4 – 8 - fold increase in comparison to neighboring nonexpressing cells . We also found that arr2 ( (cid:2) arr1 ) , although capable of trans - locating to CPs and of mediating the internalization of ac - tivated (cid:2) 2 - AR upon expression in COS1 cells ( Goodman Figure 1 . Agonist activation induces recruitment of arr3 to preexisting CPs .

GPCR modulation of the endocytic machinery | Santini et al . 667 et al . , 1996 ) , was much less effective in inducing changes in CP distribution ( unpublished data ) . To investigate whether (cid:2) 2 - AR is able to induce alter - ations in CP properties in the absence of exogenous arr3 expression , we used RBL ( (cid:2) 2 ) cells , an RBL - 2H3 subline that stably expresses Flag - tagged (cid:2) 2 - ARs ( Santini et al . , 2000 ) . RBL cells express detectable levels of endogenous arr , making them an ideal system to study cellular re - sponses to GPCR stimulation . Additionally , we have shown recently that treatment of these cells with ISO in - duces the selective recruitment of endogenous arr3 to CPs ( Santini et al . , 2000 ) . Following ISO stimulation of RBL ( (cid:2) 2 ) , examination of CP localization by immuno - staining with either CL ( unpublished data ) or AP - 2 anti - bodies ( Fig . 3 ) revealed arr3 accumulation in larger CPs with increased AP - 2 signal , similar to that observed in COS1 cells . m1 muscarinic receptor activation induces clustering of CPs To probe whether the ability to alter CP patterns was shared by other GPCRs , we examined RBL - 2H3 cells ( RBL [ m1 ] ) stably expressing m1 acetylcholinergic recep - tors ( m1AChR ) . Signaling events following agonist activa - tion of the m1AChR in RBL - 2H3 cells have been studied extensively ( Jones et al . , 1991 ; Hirasawa et al . , 1995 ; Dip - pel et al . , 1996 ) and include arr3 recruitment to CPs and m1AChR internalization ( Santini et al . , 2000 ) . As ob - served after stimulation of (cid:2) 2 - AR in COS1 cells , stimula - Figure 2 . Changes in CP appearance upon (cid:2) 2 - AR activation . Following treatment with ISO , COS1 cells coexpressing Flag – (cid:2) 2 - AR and arr3 show recruitment of arr3 to CPs , increase in CP size , and increased CP AP - 2 signal in comparison to arr3 - nonexpressing cells .

Digital image analysis of immunofluorescence CP spots The apparent size of spots in fluorescence microscopy , espe - cially for objects such as CPs that are at or below the diffrac - tion limit , is a function of both the object size and relative brightness . Thus , a trivial explanation for the larger apparent size of CPs revealed by CL staining in stimulated cells could be that the individual spots are simply brighter . However , measurement of mean CL pixel intensities of spots in images from agonist - treated and untreated RBL ( m1 ) cells collected under identical instrument settings revealed no significant change in spot brightness ( Table I ) . Rather , almost a dou - bling in the apparent CP spot size and a drop in the appar - ent density of CPs was observed ( Table I ) . These results sug - gest that the physical size and / or distribution of CPs on the cell was indeed altered by agonist activation of m1AChRs . When RBL ( m1 ) cells were stained for AP - 2 (cid:5) the puncta in agonist - stimulated cells appeared larger ( Fig . 4 , compare C to D ) , consistent with the changes in the appearance of CL ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Furthermore , the AP - 2 signal in these spots was also brighter compared with CP spots in unstimu - lated cells , though less pronounced than the increase ob - served in COS1 cells in response to (cid:2) 2 - AR stimulation . To assess whether these larger and brighter spots indeed re - Figure 4 . m1AChR stimulation induces changes in plasma membrane CPs . Stimulation of resting RBL ( m1 ) cells ( A ) with CBC ( 1 mM , 3 min ) induces the formation of larger CPs ( B ) as revealed by immunostaining for CL . Confocal microscopy images of untreated ( C ) or CBC - treated cells ( D ) immunostained for AP - 2 also reveals the appearance of larger CPs with greatly increased AP - 2 signal . These CPs are appropriately restricted to the plasma membrane ( x - z sections ; E and F ) . The confocal images were acquired and reproduced using identical gain settings and the same minimum and maximum display values for each unstimulated / stimulated pair .

GPCR modulation of the endocytic machinery | Santini et al . 669 flected CPs at the cell surface rather than aberrant internal structures , we used confocal x - z sectioning of AP - 2 – immu - nostained cells . The images ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) confirmed that the CPs were indeed restricted to the cell periphery as ex - pected . In RBL ( m1 ) cells marked changes in CP properties occurred between 1 – 3 min ( Fig . 4 G ) . In the continued presence of agonist the altered CP profiles persisted , subsid - ing gradually after 10 – 15 min . All of the properties noted above following GPCR stimu - lation were consistently observed when multiple antibodies against CL ( mAb X22 or polyclonal R5 , COM , 27004 ) or AP - 2 ( mAb AP . 6 or polyclonal # 31 ) were employed . In ad - dition , varied fixation conditions , compatible with specific antibodies , all gave similar results . Ultrastructural analysis of agonist - induced changes in CP profiles To learn more about agonist - induced changes in CP appear - ance , we examined control and treated RBL ( m1 ) cells by electron microscopy . As can be seen from the examples pre - sented in Fig . 5 , both untreated ( A ) and CBC - treated cells ( B – I ) show similar characteristic , bristle - coated indentations of the cell surface typical of CPs . These images confirmed that the altered appearance of CPs at the light microscopy level after agonist treatment did not reflect gross malforma - tion of coat structures , e . g . , accumulation of empty lattices or CL aggregates that have been seen under nonphysiologi - cal conditions ( Merisko et al . , 1986 ; Sandvig et al . , 1988 ; Heuser and Anderson , 1989 ) . However , quantitative analysis of these images did reveal several significant changes in CP distribution ( Table II ) . First , stimulation of RBL ( m1 ) cells with CBC for 3 min produced a 50 % increase in the number of CPs ( P (cid:6) 0 . 001 ) . Second , a twofold increase in the proportion of shal - low and flat CPs at the expense of deep CPs was observed af - ter stimulation . Most striking in the treated samples was a noticeable increase in the frequency with which CPs ap - peared to occur in close proximity to other CPs , i . e . , the CPs appeared to be clustered , with the rim of one pit almost touching that of another ( Fig . 5 , C and E ) , suggesting the existence of CPZs . In the extreme example shown in Fig . 5 H , an extended region of coated membrane is visible , com - prised of six or seven contiguous but discrete coated struc - tures . In other instances , adjacent indented CPs appear to share the same opening ( Fig . 5 , I and G ) . To quantitatively analyze this phenomenon , we characterized CPs that were within 0 . 3 (cid:4) m of each other as being ‘clustered’ , i . e . , essen - tially not resolvable by light microscopy . By this conserva - tive criterion , the occurrence of clustered CPs increased 2 . 5 - fold ( P (cid:7) 0 . 001 ) in cells that had been stimulated for 3 min ( Table II ) . However , the number of CPs in a given cluster was not changed by CBC treatment , and was between two and three on average ( control (cid:6) 2 . 27 (cid:8) 0 . 55 SD [ n (cid:6) 31 clusters ] and CBC (cid:6) 2 . 29 (cid:8) 0 . 56 SD [ n (cid:6) 57 ] ) . Thus , the dramatic appearance of larger CPs observed at the light mi - croscope level ( Figs . 2 and 4 and Table I ) following agonist activation likely reflects multiple factors : the increase in number and clustering of CPs detected ultrastructurally , the intensified signal associated with these structures , and the limited resolution of the fluorescence light microscope . Mobilization of arr3 to CPs and onset of CP clustering are separable events The ultrastructural results we obtained prompted us to con - sider in more detail the relationship between translocation of arr to CPs and the onset of clustering . In unstimulated RBL ( m1 ) cells some punctate arr3 signal could be detected , but virtually none was coincident with CPs ; in fact , the two Table II .

It was also possible to appreciate that arr3 recruitment preceded the agonist - induced increase in AP - 2 brightness in these cells ( Fig . 7 , compare 15” to 30” ) , though the latter could not be resolved from changes in CP patterns ( unpublished data ) . We were further able to distinguish between arr recruit - ment to CPs and CP changes by stimulating COS1 cells at reduced temperature . Cells transiently expressing Flag – (cid:2) 2 - AR and arr3 were stimulated with ISO at 16 (cid:3) , and arr3 and AP - 2 immunostaining were compared with that of cells stimulated at 37 (cid:3) C . As expected ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) , agonist was able to mobilize arr3 to CPs readily in both sets of cells . However , cells kept at 16 (cid:3) C for up to 45 min failed to show changes in the pattern of CPs ( unpublished data ) . Similar results were obtained upon CBC stimulation of RBL ( m1 ) cells at reduced temperature ( unpublished data ) . Next we evaluated the effect of either agonist removal or antagonist administration upon CP changes . Addition to CBC - stimulated RBL ( m1 ) cells of the m1AChR antagonists Figure 5 . Ultrastructural analysis reveals increased plasma membrane CP clustering in CBC - stimulated RBL ( m1 ) cells . Compared with unstimulated cells ( A ) , agonist stimulation ( 1 mM , 3 min ) produced an increase in the occurrence of nearby or adjacent CPs ( B – I ) . These clusters , which often comprised multiple distinct membrane - coated regions , included pits at different stages of invagination ( B – F , and H ) . See text for details . Bar , 0 . 2 (cid:4) m . signals are remarkably separate ( Fig . 6 , A – C ) . Within 30 s after addition of agonist , some localization of arr3 to CPs is detectable , though no significant clustering of pits is appar - ent ( Fig . 6 , D – F ) . After 1 min of stimulation ( Fig . 6 , G – I ) , large CPs could be detected with some frequency . Interest - ingly , at early times arr3 was often seen to localize to only one of two adjacent AP - 2 spots ( Fig . 6 , G , H , J , and K , ar - rows ) : at 30 s , 66 % of clusters have arr3 in only one of the two adjacent CPs ( n (cid:6) 46 ) . This is suggestive of the pres - ence of arr3 in only one of a nascent cluster of two or more adjacent CPs ( Fig . 6 , see merged panels and arrows ) . This phenomenon was less pronounced at longer times after ago - nist stimulation . Generally similar results were seen in COS1 cells coex - pressing (cid:2) 2 - AR and arr3 , though the changes occurred more rapidly . Here , stimulation with ISO induced readily detect - able arr recruitment to CPs in most cells as early as 15 s ( Fig . 7 ) . At this point , only a small fraction of cells displayed de - tectable changes in CP distribution , though these transfor - GPCR modulation of the endocytic machinery | Santini et al . 671 atropine or pirenzepine ( Fig . 6 , P – R , and unpublished data ) , which immediately block agonist - induced tyrosine phosphor - ylation ( unpublished data ) and histamine release ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) , caused essentially immediate disappearance of arr3 . However , in both cases , the clustered CP persisted for at least several minutes ( Fig . 6 P ) . Similar results were observed in ISO - stimulated COS1 cells expressing arr3 and (cid:2) 2 - AR upon agonist washout or upon addition of the antagonist alprenolol ( unpublished data ) . Collectively , these results indicate that arr3 recruitment to CPs precedes , and is distinct from , reorga - nization of CP patterns on the surface of the cell . However , once established , maintenance of the clustered CP phenotype does not require the continued presence of arr3 . Arr3 determinants sufficient for CP localization do not support CP reorganization Alteration of specific residues in arr3 have been described that result in substantial loss of CL ( Krupnick et al . , 1997a ) or AP - 2 ( Laporte et al . , 2000 ) binding . To investigate the contribution of these sites to the ability of arr3 to induce changes in CP dis - tribution , we cotransfected COS1 cells with Flag – (cid:2) 2 - AR and with a mutant construct coding for arr3 with either impaired CL ( LIF / A ) or AP - 2 ( R396A ) binding . Upon agonist treat - ment , recruitment of either mutant arr to CPs was substantially reduced in comparison to the wild - type protein ( Fig . 8 , WT ) , as was expected from previous work ( Krupnick et al . , 1997a ; Laporte et al . , 2000 ) . However , close inspection did reveal clear examples of colocalization of each of the mutant arr with AP - 2 in CPs . Importantly , when detected in CPs , both mutants were able to induce clustered CP formation and to increase CP - asso - ciated AP - 2 ( Fig . 8 , compare arr - expressing with nonexpressing cells ) . These results indicate that neither mutation fully abro - gates the arr3 – CP interaction in the context of the intact cell . Nevertheless , despite impaired CL or AP - 2 binding , if success - fully recruited to CPs these proteins apparently retain the abil - ity to initiate changes in CP patterns on the cell surface . Previous work has shown that constructs coding for the COOH - terminal half of arr lack high affinity interaction with receptors but retain CL and AP - 2 binding determi - nants and are constitutively localized in CPs in the absence of agonist ( Krupnick et al . , 1997b ) . We used such a con - struct ( C - ter , see Materials and methods ) to attempt to dis - tinguish between arr - coat binding and CP clustering . Upon transient expression in COS1 cells , C - ter was prominently localized to CPs in the absence ( unpublished data ) as well as the presence of agonist ( Fig . 8 ) . However , no changes in CP distribution or AP - 2 brightness were evident in comparison to control cells . Together , these results indicate that stable occupancy of arr binding sites on the CP lattice is necessary but not sufficient for initiating events leading to reorganiza - tion of CPs on the cell surface . Rather , the formation of a complex between arr3 and agonist - activated receptors is likely to be a prerequisite to the changes observed . Latrunculin B blocks CP reorganization in stimulated cells The observation that the presence of the CP binding region of arr3 in CPs is insufficient to induce CP reorganization indi - cated that other components were also required . To probe whether signaling initiated by GPCR activation was involved , Figure 6 . Endogenous arr3 is often concentrated in one CP within a cluster and CP clusters , but not arr3 , persist after antagonist treatment . RBL ( m1 ) cells were stimulated with CBC ( 1 mM ) for 0 ( A – C ) , 0 . 5 ( D – F ) , 1 ( G – I ) , 3 ( J – L ) , or 6 min ( M – O ) . At zero time ( A – C ) , endogenous arr3 ( red ) was not coincident with CPs , marked by AP - 2 ( green ) . Some coincidence of the two signals is evident within 30 s of CBC addition ( D – F , arrows ) . Between 1 – 3 min after agonist treatment , arr3 is often localized within one of two adjacent CPs ( G – L , arrows ) , less resolvable at later times ( M – O ) . Note that the degree of CP clustering does not correlate closely with intensity of arr3 signal ( M – O , arrowheads ) . P – R show cells treated for 3 min with CBC ( 1 mM ) followed by the antagonist atropine ( 10 (cid:4) M ) for 3 min . Under these conditions , arr3 has been virtually completely removed from the CPs but the clustered CP phenotype remains unchanged .

These treat - ments did not detectably impair the agonist - induced CP re - sponse ( unpublished data ) , indicating that signaling through these G proteins is not involved in the reorganization of CPs upon agonist stimulation . In addition , RBL ( m1 ) cells were pretreated with EGF receptor kinase targeted ( AG1478 ; 10 (cid:4) M , 10 min ) or broad - spectrum protein kinase inhibitors ( quercetin ; 10 (cid:4) M , 10 min ) , as well as the src family kinase in - hibitor PP1 ( 10 (cid:4) M , 15 min ) ( Hirasawa et al . , 1995 ; Wilde et al . , 1999 ) . None of these treatments blocked agonist - activated changes in CP distribution on the cell surface , or induced their occurrence in unstimulated cells ( unpublished data ) . Finally , we also tested a number of agents that affect cell ul - trastructure . Pretreatment with either colchicine ( 10 (cid:4) g / ml , 30 min ) or cytochalasin D ( 2 (cid:4) M , 20 min ) did not induce changes in CP distribution nor inhibit the effects of (cid:2) 2 - AR or m1AChR stimulation ( unpublished data ) . However , brief in - cubation with the G - actin sequestering agent latrunculin B ( 0 . 6 (cid:4) g / ml , 3 min ) was sufficient to completely block both the CBC - induced changes in CP clustering and increased AP - 2 recruitment in RBL ( m1 ) cells ( Fig . 9 , and compare with Figs . 3 and 6 ) . Under these conditions , significant drug - induced actin rearrangement was also observed ( unpublished data ) . In - terestingly , recruitment of arr3 to CPs was not detectably af - fected by latrunculin B treatment ( Fig . 9 , (cid:11) ) . Discussion Nonvisual arrestins play critical roles in the internaliza - tion of GPCRs in vivo . Because they bind both CL and AP - 2 in vitro , it has been suggested that arr could mediate the assembly of CL coats beneath the activated GPCR – arr complex by directly recruiting coat proteins ( Zuker and Ranganathan , 1999 ; Laporte et al . , 2000 ) . Several studies from our laboratory and others have found no direct rela - tionship between CP formation and the overall density of receptors undergoing either constitutive or stimulus - induced internalization ( Santini and Keen , 1996 ; Santini et al . , 1998 ; Warren et al . , 1998 ) . However , in some cells CP formation can be rapidly induced in response to acti - vation of some signaling receptors ( Connolly et al . , 1981 , 1984 ; Geisow et al . , 1985 ; Wilde et al . , 1999 ; Beattie et al . , 2000 ) , indicating that physiological mechanisms exist that regulate CP levels . In view of these findings , the po - tential role of GPCRs and arr in CP formation and dy - namics deserved investigation . Figure 8 . Clustering of CPs requires recruitment of functional arr3 . COS1 cells expressing Flag – (cid:2) 2 - AR and either wild - type arr3 ( WT ) , arr3 with impaired AP - 2 - ( R396A ) or CL - binding ( LIF / A ) , or arr3 284 – 409 ( C - ter ) were stimulated with ISO ( 10 (cid:4) M , 5 min ) . Although the extent to which either of the mutant full - length arr3 proteins was recruited to CPs ( AP - 2 , left ) was greatly diminished , each was capable of inducing formation of the larger , clustered CPs . However , the COOH - terminal domain of arr3 , which colocalized with AP - 2 in the absence ( unpublished data ) or presence ( C - ter ) of agonist , was incapable of inducing this change in CP appearance . Insets show fourfold magnification of the boxed area of the cell . Bar , 10 (cid:4) m . Figure 7 . Changes in CP morphology and distribution follow arr3 recruitment to CPs . Recruitment of arr3 to CPs ( AP - 2 ) can be visualized after only 15 s ( 15” ) of ISO ( 10 (cid:4) M ) stimulation in COS1 cells transiently expressing (cid:2) 2 - AR and arr3 . At this time , the appearance of CPs in the arr3 - expressing cells is indistinguishable from that in nonexpressing counterparts . Subsequent to arr3 recruit - ment ( 30” ) , increases in CP size and in AP - 2 signal become apparent . Note that there is little proportionality between the levels of arr3 and the AP - 2 spot size and brightness ( see arrowheads in insets ) . Insets are fourfold magnified view of the cell area boxed . Bar , 10 (cid:4) m . GPCR modulation of the endocytic machinery | Santini et al . 673 Our live cell studies with GFP - arr3 provide direct evi - dence that activated receptor – arr complexes are targeted to and accumulate in preexisting CPs , which then undergo physiological internalization . These results argue for a highly restricted distribution of CP assembly sites ( see be - low ) , consistent with previous observations ( Estes et al . , 1996 ; Santini and Keen , 1996 ; Gonzalez - Gaitan et al . , 1997 ; Santini et al . , 1998 ; Gaidarov et al . , 1999b ) . Though the GPCR – arr3 complex does not nucleate CPs , after stimulation of (cid:2) 2 - AR or m1AChR and recruitment of the GPCR – arr3 complex to CPs we observed a change in the number and distribution of plasma membrane CPs . This response was rapid , agonist - and temperature - depen - dent and required GPCR and arr3 recruitment to CPs . These changes must be distinct from those involved in the membrane ruffling that occurs in response to activation of many receptors ( Beck et al . , 2001 ) : stimulation of RBL cells via the Fc (cid:12) RI receptor ( Apgar , 1990 ) or by PMA ( Ap - gar , 1995 ) causes membrane ruffling and changes in actin microfilaments ( see below ) , but fails to induce the CP rear - rangements elicited by (cid:2) 2 - AR or m1AChR activation re - ported here ( unpublished data ) . Agonist stimulation of GPCRs often initiates transactiva - tion of other receptors , including receptor tyrosine kinases ( Luttrell et al . , 1999 ) . Though tyrosine phosphorylation of CL heavy chain has been suggested to affect CPs ( Wilde et al . , 1999 ) , no CL heavy chain phosphorylation was detect - able upon agonist stimulation ( unpublished data ) . More - over , inhibitors of the EGFR kinase ( AG1478 ) , of Src and Src - related kinases ( PP1 ) , and a broad spectrum tyrosine ki - nase inhibitor ( quercetin ) all failed to block CBC - stimulated CP changes ( unpublished data ) , though the latter two re - agents ( Hirasawa et al . , 1995 ; Amoui et al . , 1997 ) did block degranulation and blunt overall phosphotyrosine production following Fc (cid:12) RI or m1AChR activation in our hands ( un - published data ) . Thus , tyrosine kinases do not appear to play a role in these CP changes . The CP response was elicited by stimulation of (cid:2) 2 - AR and m1AChR , which work through distinct G - proteins ( G (cid:5) s and G (cid:5) q / 11 , respectively ) and effectors ( adenylate cyclase and PLC , respectively ) . In addition , incubation with cholera or pertussis toxins or AlF (cid:10) 4 did not affect the CP response me - diated by either receptor . Further , treating the cells with for - skolin in the presence of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors also was without effect ( unpublished data ) . However , physi - cal recruitment of competent , even if binding impaired , arr3 – GPCR complexes to CPs was required for CP increases and clustering ( Fig . 8 ) . Together , these results suggest that the CP changes require : ( a ) formation of a complex between arr3 and activated receptors ; ( b ) the presence of additional factor / s recruited to the arr – receptor signaling complex ; and / or ( c ) downstream signaling by the activated GPCR – arr complex distinct from that mediated by G (cid:5) s / G (cid:5) i trimeric G proteins . GPCR stimulation resulted in increased AP - 2 signal asso - ciated with CPs , without a concomitant increase in the CL signal . Interestingly , despite the variation in AP - 2 / CL pro - portions the lattice size of CPs upon GPCR stimulation re - mained unaffected as confirmed by direct ultrastructural analysis ( unpublished data ) . Increases in AP - 2 brightness have been noted previously following GPCR stimulation ( Laporte et al . , 1999 ) , and variation in AP - 2 / CL ratios are also known to occur ( Brown et al . , 1999 ; Keren et al . , 2001 ) . Stoichiometric AP - 2 / arr3 binding ( Laporte et al . , 1999 ) is unlikely to explain this phenomenon , as their sig - nals were not generally proportional ( Fig . 7 , arrowheads ) . Alternatively , additional AP - 2 may have bound directly to unoccupied sites on the CL lattices ( Keen et al . , 1991 ) indi - rectly through interaction with other coat - associated pro - teins , or to nearby potential assembly sites in response to GPCR activation . Ultrastructural analysis of stimulated cells revealed both an increase in the number of CPs and in the proportion of CPs occurring in clusters . Together , these changes likely ac - count for the striking apparent increase in CP size observed by light microscopy . Arr3 recruitment to preexisting CPs is the earliest detectable response to GPCR activation . How - ever , there is an intervening period , before frankly larger CPs are observed , in which arr3 is detected in only one of a pair of adjacent CPs ( Fig . 6 ) . Based on these images and the ul - trastructural data , we propose that initial accumulation of arr3 – GPCR complexes in preexisting CPs induces the for - mation of nearby CPs that do not contain , at least initially , any arr3 . These new CPs then rapidly become loaded with arr3 – GPCR complexes . One reagent effective in blocking agonist - induced CP clus - tering was latrunculin B , which acts by sequestering G - actin monomers ( Spector et al . , 1983 , 1989 ; Coue et al . , 1987 ) . Figure 9 . Latrunculin B inhibits agonist - induced CP clustering . RBL ( m1 ) cells were treated with latrunculin B for 3 min before treatment for 5 min with vehicle ( (cid:10) ) or CBC ( (cid:11) ) . Cells were fixed , permeabilized , and immunostained for AP - 2 and arr3 . Latrunculin B did not affect CP appearance ( AP - 2 ) in unstimulated cells ( (cid:10) ) nor did it inhibit agonist - induced arr3 recruitment to CPs ( (cid:11) , insets , arrows ) . However , it did block CP clustering and the rise in CP - associated AP - 2 . Insets are fourfold magnified views of the cell area boxed . Bar , 10 (cid:4) m . 674 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 4 , 2002 There is ample evidence to suggest that actin plays a role in endocytosis ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Munn , 2001 ) and several coat and associated proteins bind to or regulate actin assem - bly ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Hussain et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , several members of the Rho family of small GTPases are known to be involved in both CL endocytosis and in actin rearrangements induced by receptor signaling ( Lamaze et al . , 1996 ; Yang et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , cytochalasin D , a drug that inhibits actin po - lymerization by capping the barbed end of existing actin fila - ments and thereby preventing their elongation ( Spector et al . , 1989 ) , was ineffective in blocking the GPCR - induced CP changes . These results extend our previous observations in which we found that treating cells with latrunculin but not cytochalasin increased the lateral movement of CPs in the plasma membrane ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999b ) . Together , they argue that the CP machinery is intimately connected to a cor - tical actin network , often resistant to cytochalasin ( Cooper , 1987 ) but susceptible to latrunculin ( Cassimeris et al . , 1990 ) , and which provides a fence - like restriction to the movement of established CPs ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999b ) . Further , actin re - arrangements upon agonist stimulation appear to provide conditions necessary for the assembly of new clustered CPs . Work from our lab and others has established that en - docytic CPs occur at defined loci , rather than being ran - domly distributed on the cell surface . The results presented here suggest that these sites should actually be envisaged as CPZs , capable of supporting formation of adjacent , clus - tered CPs . Conversely , substantial expanses of cell surface lack this capability at any given time . We propose that each CPZ exists as a discrete , comparatively stable plasma mem - brane – cytoskeleton domain with micron dimensions , per - haps analogous to raft structures whose properties are being increasingly appreciated ( Ikonen , 2001 ) . Within each CPZ , an actin framework may help to physically organize the as - sembly of signaling complexes and provide a mechanical ba - sis for inter - CPZ movements . The clustered distribution of CPs , in turn , could facilitate functional cross - talk between assemblies of different receptor signaling platforms .

RBL - 2H3 cells stably expressing the human m1 muscarinic receptor ( RBL [ m1 ] ) ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) were supplied by Dr . M . Beaven ( National Institutes of Health , Be - thesda , MD ) . RBL - 2H3 cells stably expressing a Flag - tagged human (cid:2) 2 - adren - ergic receptor ( RBL [ (cid:2) 2 ] ) were described previously ( Santini et al . , 2000 ) . Cell lysis , CL immunoprecipitation , and phosphotyrosine detection were per - formed as described ( Santini and Beaven , 1993 ; Gaidarov et al . , 1999b ) . Plasmids and cell transfection Constructs coding for Flag - (cid:2) 2 AR ( Goodman et al . , 1996 ) and arr3 in which Leu - 373 , Ile - 374 , and Phe - 376 were mutated to Ala ( arr3 - LIF / A ) ( Krupnick et al . , 1997b ) have been described , as has DsRed - CL ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ) . Arr3 - R396A was generated by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing . Constructs coding for GFP - arr3 ( Mundell et al . , 2000 ) , bovine arr3 short form , and the COOH - terminal region of arr3 ( residues 284 – 409 ) ( Orsini and Benovic , 1998 ) were gifts of Dr . J . Benovic ( Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , PA ) . Transfection was performed as described ( Goodman et al . , 1996 ) . Agonist and pharmacological treatments Experiments involving RBL cells were performed in a glucose - saline , PIPES - buffered medium ( pH 7 . 2 ) that contained 0 . 1 % BSA and 1 mM Ca 2 (cid:11) ( Santini and Keen , 1996 ) . Experiments involving COS1 cells were per - formed in Hepes - supplemented complete DME medium ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999a ) . After 10 min equilibration in the experimental buffer , cells were incubated with the drug or vehicle for the specified period of time before addition of 1 mM CBC , 10 (cid:4) M ISO , or vehicle . Drugs requiring more than 15 min incubation time ( e . g . , pertussis and cholera toxins ) were added to cells in complete medium . The following drugs were added to RBL ( m1 ) cells before stimulation with CBC ( 1 mM , 3 min ) to probe their effectiveness in inhibiting the ago - nist effect on CPs : 2 (cid:4) M cytochalasin D for 20 min ; 5 (cid:4) g / ml brefeldin A for 40 min ; 10 (cid:4) M quercetin for 10 min ( Hirasawa et al . , 1995 ) ; 30 (cid:4) M AlF (cid:10) 4 ( prepared by mixing 10 mM NaF with 10 (cid:4) M AlCl 3 ) for 3 min ; 1 (cid:4) g / ml cholera toxin for 4 h ( Ali et al . , 1990 ) ; 0 . 1 (cid:4) g / ml pertussis toxin for 4 h ( Ali et al . , 1990 ) ; 10 (cid:4) M AG1478 for 10 min ; 10 (cid:4) M PP1 for 15 min . The m1AChR antagonists atropine ( 10 (cid:4) M final concentration ) and piren - zepine ( 0 . 1 (cid:4) M final concentration ) were used as specified in the text . La - trunculin B was used at 0 . 6 (cid:4) g / ml . The effect of each of the treatment alone was also tested in unstimulated cells . Drugs were substituted by ve - hicle alone in control cells . Fluorescence microscopy of DsRed - CL and GFP - arr3 – expressing cells DsRed - CL and GFP - arr3 – expressing cells grown on coverslip - bottom cham - bers ( LabTek ) overnight were transferred to warm Hepes 0 . 1 % BSA - supple - mented serum - free F - 12 medium ( GIBCO - BRL ) , placed on the microscope stage ( at 37 (cid:3) C ) , and images were obtained as described previously ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999b ) . CP dynamics ( DsRed signal ) and mobilization of arr3 ( GFP signal ) following addition of ISO were studied on sequences of 100 or 120 images taken using continuous time - lapse recording . An excitation wave - length alternating between 488 and 554 nm was used which produced a 1 . 7 s interval between successive frames of the same channel . Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously ( San - tini and Keen , 1996 , 2000 ) . CL was detected using X - 22 ( 30 (cid:4) g / ml ) , AP - 2 with AP . 6 ( 20 (cid:4) g / ml ) , and arr3 with 182 . 6 ( 1 : 100 ) . F - actin was visualized using Bodipy 503 / 512 - phallacidin ( 5 U / ml ; Molecular Probes ) and primary antibodies were detected with appropriate tagged second antibodies ( 1 : 100 ) . Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop ® . Evaluation of plasma membrane CPs CP density and distribution was estimated in cells immunostained for AP - 2 and analyzed by confocal x - z scanning as described previously ( Santini and Keen , 1996 ; Santini et al . , 1998 ) . Alternatively , images of cells immu - nostained for CL or AP - 2 were acquired using a widefield system ( Santini and Keen , 2000 ) as specified above . After determining background level , 50 (cid:9) 50 pixel boxes were drawn in the cell periphery , and IPLab software version 3 . 2 . 4 ( Scanalytics ) was used to count CP spots and quantitate their signal intensity and area . Electron microscopy Control RBL ( m1 ) cells and RBL ( m1 ) cells stimulated with CBC for 3 min were rinsed in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , fixed , and processed as described ( Smith et al . , 1985 ) . Determination of CP number ( Table II ) was performed on 36 and 26 low magnification ( 13 , 500 (cid:9) ) microphotographs of control and stimulated cells , respectively . The length of plasma mem - GPCR modulation of the endocytic machinery | Santini et al . 675 brane from cell sections on each photograph was measured and coated structures and clusters , defined as coated structures (cid:13) 0 . 3 (cid:4) m apart , were counted . High magnification photographs ( 70 , 200 (cid:9) ) were used to classify coated structures as : ( a ) “shallow pits” if their depth is less than 1 / 2 of their diameter , including flat coated membrane segments ; or ( b ) “deeply invagi - nated pits” whose depth is (cid:14) 1 / 2 of their diameter , including putative “coated vesicles” exhibiting no continuity between the structure and the plasma membrane . Data are expressed as means (cid:8) SEM . The Wilcoxon rank sum / Mann - Whitney test was performed using SYSTAT . Online supplemental material Agonist activation induces recruitment of arr3 to preexisting CPs . HEK293 cells coexpressing GFP - arr3 , DsRed - CL , and Flag - tagged (cid:2) 2 - AR were incu - bated in 25 mM Hepes - supplemented F - 12 medium and viewed on the 37 (cid:3) stage of a microscope . DsRed and GFP signals were alternately ac - quired with an interval of 1 . 7 s between frame initiation . Total acquisition time for the entire sequence was 2 . 5 min . ISO ( 10 (cid:4) M ) was added 27 s af - ter the start of the series ( between frames 8 and 9 ) . The video is played back at a speed of 8 . 33 frames / s .
