Tang 1 , 2 * , Verónica M . Vieira 1 and Eric Shearer 2 Abstract Background : Spatial variability of COVID - 19 cases may suggest geographic disparities of social determinants of health . Spatial analyses of population - level data may provide insight on factors that may contribute to COVID - 19 transmission , hospitalization , and death . Methods : Generalized additive models were used to map COVID - 19 risk from March 2020 to February 2021 in Orange County ( OC ) , California . We geocoded and analyzed 221 , 843 cases to OC census tracts within a Poisson frame - work while smoothing over census tract centroids . Location was randomly permuted 1000 times to test for random - ness . We also separated the analyses temporally to observe if risk changed over time . COVID - 19 cases , hospitalizations , and deaths were mapped across OC while adjusting for population - level demographic data in crude and adjusted models . Results : Risk for COVID - 19 cases , hospitalizations , and deaths were statistically significant in northern OC . Adjust - ment for demographic data substantially decreased spatial risk , but areas remained statistically significant . Inclusion of location within our models considerably decreased the magnitude of risk compared to univariate models . How - ever , percent minority ( adjusted RR : 1 . 06 , 95 % CI : 1 . 06 , 1 . 07 ) , average household size ( aRR : 1 . 06 , 95 % CI : 1 . 05 , 1 . 07 ) , and percent service industry ( aRR : 1 . 05 , 95 % CI : 1 . 04 , 1 . 06 ) remained significantly associated with COVID - 19 risk in adjusted spatial models . In addition , areas of risk did not change between surges and risk ratios were similar for hospitalizations and deaths . Conclusion : Significant risk factors and areas of increased risk were identified in OC in our adjusted models and sug - gests that social and environmental factors contribute to the spread of COVID - 19 within communities . Areas in north OC remained significant despite adjustment , but risk substantially decreased . Additional investigation of risk factors may provide insight on how to protect vulnerable populations in future infectious disease outbreaks .

Introduction Since the first local case of novel coronavirus 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) was identified in January 2020 , Orange County ( OC ) , California , has experienced several distinct surges of disease transmission . The first wave occurred in June and July of 2020 ( surge 1 ) , followed by a second and more intense wave spanning November 2020 to January 2021 ( surge 2 ) . During both surges , populous cities of Santa Ana and Anaheim recorded higher inci - dence rates compared to the rest of the county . The local health department , Orange County Health Care Agency ( OCHCA ) , reported that Anaheim accounted for 17 % of all cases during both surges , and Santa Ana accounted for 19 % and 18 % during surge 1 and 2 respectively [ 1 ] .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1212 Furthermore , COVID - 19 has reemphasized the already existing disparities and health inequities amongst minor - ity populations . During surge 1 , Hispanic cases made up a higher proportion ( 64 % ) of community deaths com - pared to Non - Hispanic White ( 21 % ) and Non - Hispanic Asian ( 11 % ) . A similar trend was observed during surge 2 , where Hispanic cases made up 46 % of community deaths compared to Non - Hispanic White ( 29 % ) and Non - Hispanic Asian ( 22 % ) [ 1 ] . These health disparities were noted by county health officials and were observed to differ spatially ; therefore , social determinants of dis - ease may explain spatial variability of COVID - 19 . The relationship between social determinants of health and communicable diseases has been documented prior to the COVID - 19 pandemic . During a 2009 outbreak of measles in Romania , public health epidemiologists con - cluded that “minority groups and living in close com - munities were at higher risk of measles infection” [ 2 ] . A European study found an inverse relationship between public wealth and prevalence rates of tuberculosis amongst EU member states [ 3 ] . Additionally , the clus - tering of COVID - 19 cases in OC suggest considerable variability within a county and prior studies in OC have observed disparities in low - income , disadvantaged , and minority communities [ 4 – 6 ] . These disparities may be compounded in the community due to factors including inadequate health insurance coverage , limited access to care , poor health literacy , employment in high - exposure jobs , and housing insecurity and overcrowding , sug - gesting that social factors exacerbate pandemics [ 7 – 14 ] . Many observational studies are unable to account for confounding by occupation , education , and housing status which may increase the likelihood of COVID - 19 outcomes [ 11 ] . These factors were influenced by the Commission on Social Determinants of Health ( CSDH ) framework by the World Health Organization in which socioeconomic positions are interplaying with societal policies and governance . Therefore , structural inequali - ties are to be addressed in order to limit communicable diseases that are exacerbated by social factors [ 15 ] . The spread of an infectious disease is spatial in nature , and clustering of COVID - 19 cases has been documented around the world [ 16 ] . Many of these studies use large spatial scales , such as provinces , or counties , but social and environmental determinants of health may vary widely within these large regions [ 13 , 17 – 21 ] . Initial surveillance from OCHCA observed more cases in specific communities in the OC , potentially suggest - ing spatial clustering of COVID - 19 outcomes . Therefore , using readily available patient data captured in public health surveillance systems , this study seeks to inves - tigate the spatial distribution of COVID - 19 cases in the context of social determinants of health associated with COVID - 19 transmission , hospitalization , and death using census - tract data . We used generalized additive models to analyze COVID - 19 census - tract level spatial patterns in an ecological study and assess whether community risk factors such as race / ethnicity , service occupation , house - hold size , and age contributed to those patterns . This study benefits from using data from the start of COVID - 19 pandemic and does not include variants , rapid - testing , and only incorporated early vaccine distribution . It also aims to investigate COVID - 19 at a finer spatial resolution than previous studies and how specific community fac - tors impact COVID - 19 outcomes . Methods Study population and area Confirmed COVID - 19 cases are reported to OCHCA through the state - wide public health reporting system for reportable diseases . Confirmed cases were cases that had a positive polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) result . This study included cases which had specimen collected dates from January 28 th , 2020 to February 28 th , 2021 . Data included the residential location of each case , whether they were hospitalized , and whether they died from COVID - 19 . Additional race / ethnicity data for cases were not considered for this analysis due to missingness . Cases missing longitude and latitude ( 6 . 6 % ) and specimen col - lected date ( < 0 . 01 % ) were not included in this analysis . We also excluded cases outside of OC , that were unable to be geocoded , incarcerated , long - term care facility resi - dents , and homeless shelter residents ( 4 . 0 % total ) in order to identify risk within the community . Therefore , 221 , 843 cases were analyzed in order to observe cases in the com - munity . This study examined the effect of location using census tracts within OC . Census tracts are small subdivi - sions within the county that have between 1 , 200 to 8 , 000 people , with an optimum size of 4 , 000 people , making it an ideal unit of measure for a local municipality . The size is often determined by the area of the census tract rela - tive to the population , and therefore smaller area census tracts represent higher population density , and larger area census tracts have lower density [ 22 ] . The number of COVID - 19 cases were aggregated for the 583 OC census tracts , and the X and Y coordinates of each census tract were then used in our analysis to estimate the log risk across location . This study was reviewed and approved by the OCHCA IRB Review Board . Community variables We assessed the effect of community risk factors on loca - tion using data collected by the 2019 Census American Community Survey ( ACS ) and included variables which we hypothesized contributed to COVID - 19 risk at the census - tract level . COVID - 19 has disproportionately Page 3 of 9 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1212 affected some populations more than others [ 23 – 25 ] . We calculated the percent of minority at each census tract , defined as the sum of Black , Hispanic / Latino , Asian , Mixed - Race , and Other . Percent of individuals in the ser - vice industries were included to capture those who were in high - risk occupations and may not be able to socially - distance during state - wide stay - at - home orders [ 12 , 26 ] . Average household size was also included to account for household spread , and median household income was used as a surrogate for education and as an indica - tor for the ability to stay at home [ 27 – 29 ] . Lastly , we also included percent 65 years and older at each census tract to also capture high - risk groups [ 30 , 31 ] . We examined percent with a high school education and above as a risk factor of interest in our univariate analyses but excluded it from our full analysis due to multicollinearity issues . Statistical analysis We investigated the relationship between COVID - 19 and location in two analyses : a primary analysis with COVID - 19 cases , and a secondary analysis with hospitalization and deaths from COVID - 19 . We separated our primary analysis into three time periods : the full study period ( March 1 , 2020 to February 28 , 2021 ) , the first half of the study period which contained surge 1 ( March 1 , 2020 to August 31 , 2020 ) and second half of study period which contained surge 2 ( September 1 , 2020 to February 28 , 2021 ) . Only one case occurred between January 28 , 2020 and March 2020 , and we therefore included that case in the full analysis and the analysis of the first half of the pandemic . Each time period captured a peak surge and a period of case depression . We used generalized additive models ( GAM ) within a Poisson framework to analyze the spatial association between location and confirmed COVID - 19 cases while simultaneously adjusting for community variables using the MapGAM package ( version 1 . 2 – 5 ) in R ( version 4 . 0 . 2 ) . Location in this model is the centroid of a census tract and accounts for each census tract’s population relative to its area using an offset in the Poisson framework . GAMs estimate the log risk of COVID - 19 at a specific location by applying a locally weighted straight line smoother ( LOESS ) to smooth over location ( longitude and latitude ) . The degree of smoothing , or optimal span size , is deter - mined by minimizing the Akaike’s Information Criterion ( AIC ) . The span size refers to the percent of data that is being weighted as a distance of function . For example , a span size of 0 . 20 would use 20 % of the nearest data from a point on the map to calculate the log disease risk . The smaller the span size , the more variation of risk is dis - played while larger span sizes create a smoother surface . Without the smoothing term , the GAM is a regular GLM model . The GAM framework is defined as : where Log [ p ( X , Y ) ] is the log disease risk at a census tract centroid , S ( X , Y ) is the smoothing function of loca - tion at centroid position X , Y , offset ( pop ) is the popula - tion size of the census tract , and α are covariate Z with their respective β coefficients . The GAM model will pre - dict the log risk for all possible combinations of X and Y centroids in the study area . The centroids of census tracts are then randomly permuted 1000 times across the study area to test whether location is significant glob - ally and locally . The global test of location is calculated by comparing the deviance of a model with and without the smoothing term , while local significant values rank the lower and upper 2 . 5 % of the permuted pointwise dis - tribution . Risk is therefore indicated as the z - dimension , denoted by color on the map , across a two - dimensional surface representing X and Y . For our GAM maps , we report crude models which includes only the smoothing function for location and population size , and the adjusted model which includes the smoothing term for location , population size , and our covariates . The adjusted models also produce risk ratios for covariates , providing an effect estimate for the asso - ciation between that variable and COVID - 19 outcomes . A “flat” map with no variation in color signals that our covariates explained some of the spatial variability of COVID - 19 cases . In addition , we report effect estimates from standard generalized linear models ( GLM ) with a Poisson distribution used in our univariate analyses for each of the covariates ( i . e . , without the smoothing func - tion ) to observe risk ratios without accounting for spatial location . In total , we produce maps illustrating spatial risk in a crude GAM model and an adjusted GAM model ; we also report effect estimates for model covariates with a univariate GLM model and an adjusted GAM model that includes a smoothing term for location ( same model that produces the map ) . Results A total of 221 , 843 cases were included in our analysis across our entire study period . These cases were geo - coded and analyzed to 579 of 583 census tracts within OC ; there were 4 census tracts that were missing either race / ethnicity data , household income , average Log [ p ( X , Y ) ] = S ( X , Y ) + oﬀset ( pop ) + α ; α = β 0 + β 1 Z 1 + β 2 Z 2 + · · · + β j Z j Page 4 of 9 Tang et al .

In these missing census tracts , there were 266 cases , 14 hospi - talizations , and 4 deaths were thereby excluded from the analysis . These census tracts included the ocean , Dis - neyland , Newport Coast , and a recycling center . At the start of the pandemic ( surge 1 ) , cases ranged from 2 – 369 cases per census tract , and increased to 9 to 1 , 230 cases by the second half ( surge 2 ) of the study period ( Table 1 ) . Across the entire study period , hospitalizations ranged from 0 to 68 , and averaged at 14 . 5 per census tract while deaths ranged from 0 to 26 and averaged at 4 . 7 per cen - sus tract . Demographic data among all census tracts had wide ranges , illustrating the diversity of communities in OC ( Table 1 , Fig . 1 ) . We identified significant areas , as indicated by black contour lines , of increased and decreased risk for COVID - 19 case status across OC . Statistically signifi - cant risk for COVID - 19 was elevated in northern OC for the entire study period , first half , and second half Fig . 1 Cities and distribution of minority populations by Census Tracts , Orange County , CA , 2019 .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1212 of the pandemic within our crude models ( Fig . 2 ) . We observed lower risk for COVID - 19 in the north - eastern corner of OC , and most parts of southern OC . After adjustment for community variables , risk decreased in northern OC but remained statistically significant ; pockets of slightly increased risks were observed in this area , but they were not statistically significant . Interestingly , adjusting for our covariates significantly increased the risk for south - western beach cities along the coast during the first half of the pandemic ( Fig . 2b ) , suggesting that there may be potential spatial con - founding in that area . Our covariates were all significantly associated with COVID - 19 case status in our crude GLM and adjusted GAM models ( Table 2 ) .

A $ 10 , 000 increase in median household income ( cRR ES : 0 . 91 [ 0 . 90 , 0 . 91 ] ) , and an increase of 1 person to average household size ( cRR ES : 1 . 52 [ 1 . 51 , 1 . 52 ] ) was also significantly associated with decreased and increased risk , respectively . The magni - tude of our effect estimates was stronger in the first half of the study period compared to the second period . How - ever , after adjusting for covariates and location in the full model ( Table 2 ) , high risk ( adjusted RR range 1 . 05 – 1 . 10 ) and low risk ( aRR range 0 . 94 – 0 . 99 ) covariates moved towards the null but all remained statistically significant . Spatial risk for hospitalizations and deaths by census tract were similar to cases ; risk was increased in northern OC and decreased in southern OC for crude and adjusted models ( Fig . 3 ) . We also observed a statistically signifi - cant area of increased risk in southern OC for COVID - 19 deaths after adjustment ( Fig . 3b ) . Hospitalization and death univariate GLM analyses were similar to COVID - 19 cases . However , in the adjusted GAM model , percent 65 and older reversed direction and became significantly associated with elevated risk of hospitalizations ( aRR ES : 1 . 17 [ 1 . 13 , 1 . 21 ] ) and death ( aRR ES : 1 . 31 [ 1 . 25 , 1 . 38 ] ) ( Table 3 ) . Percent in service industry no longer became significant after full adjustment for hospitalizations and deaths , and median household income also became null . Discussion We observed significantly increased COVID - 19 risk within census tracts in northern OC while considering community variables that may increase COVID - 19 risk . Location was statistically significant even after adjust - ment of community variables . However , our adjusted GAM models illustrate a reduction of overall spatial risk across all three models , specifically in high risk areas in north OC . This area of high risk spatially overlays with lower - income communities and communities of color in this study . Despite a reduction in spatial patterns across our maps , residual risk and areas of statistical significance still remain after adjustment suggesting the presence of unmeasured spatial confounders . Two regions in south OC remain at moderate risk among the surrounding sta - tistically low risk area , and areas along the center coast - line became statistically significant after adjustment . This may be the result from personal perspectives from indi - viduals who are resistant to public health interventions . Our results also support many studies that observe health inequities with COVID - 19 among disadvantaged communities [ 21 , 32 ] . Within OC , census tracts with higher percentages of minority residents and service workers were associated with higher risk of COVID - 19 . These results are similar to a spatial study across the US which observed a greater proportion of Black individuals associated with COVID - 19 and occupation was a strong predictor of cases [ 33 ] . Higher prevalence of COVID - 19 were reported among Hispanic residents in Los Angeles and Orange County , potentially due to overrepresenta - tion in industries that were considered essential during the pandemic [ 5 , 12 , 34 ] . This area of high risk observed in our study consists of minority communities who may also reside in crowded neighborhoods , may not be able to physically distance , and have other comorbidities that may worsen their COVID - 19 prognosis [ 35 ] . An occu - pational study on seroprevalence among firefighters also identified a higher proportion of Hispanic firefighters who were reluctant to participate in disease surveillance Table 2 Univariate and adjusted risk ratios for the association between community factors and COVID - 19 cases Results are reported as risk ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals ) by census tracts , Orange County , California , March 2020 - February 2021 a March 1 , 2020 - August 31 , 2020 b September 1 , 2020 - February 28 , 2021 c per 10 % increase d per $ 10 , 000 increase Univariate GLM analysis without location Adjusted GAM analysis with location Entire Study Period Surge 1 a Surge 2 b Entire Study Period Surge 1 a Surge 2 b N cases 1519 369 1230 1519 369 1230 Percent Minority c 1 . 19 ( 1 . 18 , 1 . 19 ) 1 . 22 ( 1 . 21 , 1 . 22 ) 1 . 18 ( 1 . 18 , 1 . 18 ) 1 . 06 ( 1 . 06 , 1 . 07 ) 1 . 07 ( 1 . 06 , 1 . 09 ) 1 . 06 ( 1 . 06 , 1 . 07 ) Average Household Size 1 . 52 ( 1 . 51 , 1 . 52 ) 1 . 63 ( 1 . 62 , 1 . 65 ) 1 . 49 ( 1 . 48 , 1 . 50 ) 1 . 06 ( 1 . 05 , 1 . 07 ) 1 . 10 ( 1 . 08 , 1 . 13 ) 1 . 05 ( 1 . 04 , 1 . 06 ) Percent Service c 1 . 50 ( 1 . 50 , 1 . 51 ) 1 . 62 ( 1 . 61 , 1 . 64 ) 1 . 48 ( 1 . 47 , 1 . 48 ) 1 . 05 ( 1 . 04 , 1 . 06 ) 1 . 06 ( 1 . 04 , 1 . 09 ) 1 . 04 ( 1 . 03 , 1 . 05 ) Median Household Income d 0 . 91 ( 0 . 90 , 0 . 91 ) 0 . 89 ( 0 . 89 , 0 . 89 ) 0 . 91 ( 0 . 91 , 0 . 91 ) 0 . 98 ( 0 . 98 , 0 . 99 ) 0 . 98 ( 0 . 97 , 0 . 99 ) 0 . 99 ( 0 . 98 , 0 . 99 ) Percent 65 + c 0 . 74 ( 0 . 73 , 0 . 74 ) 0 . 66 ( 0 . 65 , 0 . 67 ) 0 . 75 ( 0 . 75 , 0 . 76 ) 0 . 97 ( 0 . 96 , 0 . 97 ) 0 . 94 ( 0 . 92 , 0 . 96 ) 0 . 97 ( 0 . 96 , 0 . 98 ) Percent Educated c 0 . 79 ( 0 . 79 , 0 . 79 ) 0 . 75 ( 0 . 75 , 0 . 75 ) 0 . 80 ( 0 . 79 , 0 . 80 ) - - - Page 7 of 9 Tang et al .

Census tracts in northern OC tended to have larger aver - age household sizes than those of south OC .

This study also observed statistically significant associa - tions with ZIP code - level median household income and household crowding ( defined as > 1 person per room ) and observed shifts in risk early in the pandemic [ 6 ] . This study had a few limitations that must be consid - ered when interpreting the results . Our analysis primarily relied on PCR positive tests and therefore only captured cases that were either symptomatic , or close contacts with other positive cases . A study in the summer of 2020 observed a seven - fold greater seroprevalence than diag - nosed cases in Orange County , and we therefore may underestimate the risk of COVID within our study [ 5 ] . In addition , individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to underutilize testing , limiting surveillance in already vulnerable communities [ 37 , 38 ] . To our knowl - edge , only one other study has used GAM to investigate spatio - temporal COVID - 19 trends [ 39 ] . The author was able to utilize individual - level data , which is preferable to ecologic data . We also utilized census tracts as our spa - tial unit of analysis and therefore subject to the modifiable areal unit problem and the uncertain geographic con - text problem , impacting the interpretation of our results . Furthermore , we were not able to utilize individual - level data and were limited in the available community - level data that is provided by the US Census . Data collection and surveillance at our local health department was lim - ited , with 32 % of all cases missing race / ethnicity data and 7 % missing longitude and latitude , and efforts should be made to create an efficient and thorough data collec - tion for the next epidemic that may occur . Considering the limited resources in data collection during investiga - tions and contact tracing , there must be an ongoing dis - cussion and collaboration with health care providers and commercial laboratories to collect more complete demo - graphic data . In addition , increased public health fund - ing will allow modern surveillance record systems to be deployed , which is at the root of all trend analysis and reporting . However , we were able to identify areas that are at risk for COVID - 19 infection and possibly other infectious diseases with similar determinants and parse out some of the socio - demographic factors that may increase the risk of communities . In addition , our study benefited from the use of a smaller geographic scale than prior studies and utilized novel methods to account for the effect of location and social determinants . Conclusions This study observed significant areas of increased COVID - 19 risk in northern census tracts , and decreased risk in central and southern census tracts in Orange County . The risk was similar across the first two surges of the pandemic , and for hospitalizations and deaths . In addi - tion , we identified social and environmental demograph - ics that were significantly associated with COVID - 19 , with percent minority , average household size , and percent in service industry contributing to COVID - 19 risk , and per - cent sixty - five and older , and percent educated reducing COVID - 19 risk . The association for percent sixty - five and older and average household size reversed for hospitaliza - tions and deaths . After adjusting for these factors in our full models , residual spatial risk reduced in magnitude , but remained statistically significant , suggesting the presence of unaccounted environmental or demographic risk fac - tors . Further investigation on factors that may increase risk of an infectious disease in a population is needed in order to prepare for future outbreaks .
