Zhang 1 , 3† , Yonghoon Kwon 1 , Veronica Pessino 4 , Siyu Feng 5 , Bo Huang 6 , 7 , 8 , Sohum Mehta 1 * , Jin Zhang 1 , 3 , 9 * Growing evidence suggests that many essential intracellular signaling events are compartmentalized within kinet - ically distinct microdomains in cells . Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors are powerful tools to dissect com - partmentalized signaling , but current approaches to probe these microdomains typically rely on biosensor fusion and overexpression of critical regulatory elements . Here , we present a novel class of biosensors named FluoSTEPs ( fluorescent sensors targeted to endogenous proteins ) that combine self - complementing split green fluorescent protein , CRISPR - mediated knock - in , and fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor technology to probe compartmentalized signaling dynamics in situ . We designed FluoSTEPs for simultaneously highlighting endogenous microdomains and reporting domain - specific , real - time signaling events including kinase activities , guanosine triphosphatase activation , and second messenger dynamics in live cells . A FluoSTEP for 3′ , 5′ - cyclic adenosine mono - phosphate ( cAMP ) revealed distinct cAMP dynamics within clathrin microdomains in response to stimulation of G protein – coupled receptors , showcasing the utility of FluoSTEPs in probing spatiotemporal regulation within endogenous signaling architectures . INTRODUCTION Compartmentalization of intracellular signals by macromolecular complexes can reshape the kinetics of cellular processes and provide diversity and specificity in signaling . Our understanding of this mi - crodomain architecture of signaling networks has greatly benefited from the design and utilization of genetically encoded fluorescent bio - sensors ( 1 ) . By attaching these sensors to proteins of interest ( POIs ) and introducing these fusions into living cells , researchers can moni - tor compartmentalized signals in real time ( 2 – 5 ) . Despite the utility of these biosensors , this fusion strategy has drawbacks primarily stem - ming from unintended effects from the concomitant overexpression of the POIs . Overexpression of enzymes or scaffolds can disrupt native signaling pathways by causing mislocalization , artificially enhancing / weakening certain biochemical reactions , and imbalancing the stoi - chiometry of macromolecular interactions . In addition , some bio - sensors themselves contain enzymatic components known to affect global signaling within the cell . For example , the dimerization opti - mized reporter for activation ( DORA ) RhoA sensor for measuring activity of the guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) RhoA contains active RhoA within a conformational switch ( 6 ) ; however , the over - expression of RhoA is a hallmark of several cancers with associated , downstream signaling effects ( 7 , 8 ) . Strategies have been developed to address the overexpression concerns such as using nanobodies for highlighting endogenous , active receptors and using intrabodies to recruit biosensors to endogenous compartments ( 9 , 10 ) . However , per - turbations in trafficking and signaling due to nanobody binding , as well as issues of compartment specificity , are still ever - present ( 9 , 11 , 12 ) . Ideally , an approach that combined the strength of quantitative bio - sensing , specificity of genetic fusions , and minimal perturbation of endogenous POIs would be valuable for dissecting compartmental - ized signaling within living cells . In a recent study of cyclic adenosine 3′ , 5′ - monophosphate ( cAMP ) signaling ( 13 ) , we introduced a pair of fluorescent biosensors engi - neered based on a new strategy for probing endogenous micro - domains . Here , we present the design and characterization of a suite of novel fluorescent biosensors based on this strategy . By using a self - complementing split green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) as a fluo - rescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) donor , we designed ratio - metric sensors that can be recruited and reconstituted at a tagged POI ( 14 , 15 ) , giving rise to fluorescent sensors targeted to endogenous proteins ( FluoSTEPs ) . The generation of the functional biosensors only at a POI ensures compartment specificity , and the self - complementing split GFP donor facilitates endogenous protein tagging when com - bined with CRISPR - Cas9 gene editing . We demonstrate the general - izability of FluoSTEPs by applying the modular design to measure kinase activities , GTPase activation , and second messenger dynamics . We showcase the applicability of FluoSTEPs by deploying the new sensors to uncover mechanisms governing sustained cAMP dynamics at clathrin membrane microdomains after G protein – coupled re - ceptor ( GPCR ) stimulation . RESULTS FluoSTEP – A - kinase activity reporter is reconstituted and functional at microdomains of interest Our goal with the FluoSTEP design was to construct a logic - gated FRET sensor that exists predominantly in a nonfunctional ( i . e . , 1 Department of Pharmacology , University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , CA 92093 , USA . 2 Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry , The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD 21205 , USA . 3 Department of Bioengi - neering , University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , CA 92093 , USA . 4 Graduate Program of Biophysics , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 5 The UC Berkeley - UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 6 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 7 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143 , USA . 8 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub , San Francisco , CA 94158 , USA . 9 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , CA 92093 , USA . * Corresponding author .

To install a FRET - based sensor with this control logic , we adopted the robust and bright split super - folder GFP ( sfGFP ) as the FRET donor and a red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) as the FRET ac - ceptor . Split sfGFP is divided between the 10th and 11th  strands into a pair of nonfluorescent components ( GFP 1 – 10 and GFP 11 ) capable of undergoing spontaneous fragment complementation to reconstitute intact , fluorescent sfGFP ( 15 ) . Thus , when the small GFP 11 fragment ( 16 amino acids ) is fused to a POI and expressed in the presence of GFP 1 – 10 , the reconstitution of the donor fluorophore should occur and give rise to a functional FRET - based sensor only at the POI ( Fig . 1A ) . When GFP 11 is introduced into a specific gene locus using CRISPR - Cas9 technology , this domain - specific logic con - trol further enables ratiometric FRET measurements of compart - mentalized signaling activities at endogenous protein loci . We initially applied this concept to generate a FluoSTEP A - kinase activity reporter ( FluoSTEP - AKAR ) in which protein kinase A ( PKA ) – mediated phosphorylation of a kinase - specific substrate domain causes intramolecular binding to the Forkhead - associated 1 ( FHA1 ) phospho - amino acid – binding domain ( PAABD ) , resulting in a Fig . 1 . FluoSTEP - AKAR is reconstituted and functional at microdomains of interest . ( A ) FluoSTEPs use the spontaneous fragment complementation of split sfGFP to reconstitute a functional FRET - based biosensor at a POI , as shown here with a kinase activity reporter . Probe species that fail to reconstitute contain a nonfluorescent donor and thus do not contribute to the FRET signal .

Specifically , we exchanged the Cerulean ( cyan ) donor and cpVenus ( yellow ) acceptor FPs in AKAR4 ( 16 ) with GFP 1 – 10 and mRuby2 ( 17 ) , respectively , to make a complementation - dependent green - red FRET probe ( G 1 – 10 - R – FluoSTEP - AKAR ; Fig . 1B ) . Given that FRET efficiency is determined not only by the distance between the donor and acceptor fluorescence transition dipole moments but also by their relative orientation ( 18 ) and because the repositioned C terminus of sfGFP 1 – 10 may alter the orienta - tion of the donor analogous to the effect of circular permutation ( 19 ) , we also tested a variant in which the GFP 1 – 10 donor and mRuby2 accep - tor were swapped ( R - G 1 – 10 – FluoSTEP - AKAR ; Fig . 1B ) . In human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293T cells transiently ex - pressing actin N - terminally tagged with GFP 11 ( GFP 11 - actin ) , both sensor variants demonstrated the spontaneous reconstitution of GFP fluorescence . However , only the R - G 1 – 10 – FluoSTEP - AKAR sensor produced a robust increase in the red / green emission ratio ( sensi - tized acceptor RFP emission due to FRET divided by direct donor GFP emission ) after the addition of the transmembrane adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) activator forskolin ( Fsk ; 50  M ) and the phosphodies - terase ( PDE ) inhibitor 3 - isobutyl - 1 - methylxanthine ( IBMX ; 100  M ) [ normalized ratio change (  R / R ) = 8 . 7 ± 0 . 44 % ( means ± SEM ) , n = 18 cells ] ( Fig . 1C ) , with a time – to – half - maximum response ( t 1 / 2 ) of 0 . 51 ± 0 . 04 min ( table S1 ) . Intracellular FRET efficiencies for this sensor were measured by acceptor photobleaching to be 7 ± 2 % and 11 ± 1 % ( n = 34 cells ) before and after Fsk / IBMX stimulation , re - spectively . The G 1 – 10 - R – FluoSTEP - AKAR sensor generated a smaller Fsk / IBMX - induced response compared to its counterpart (  R / R = 2 . 9 ± 0 . 74 % , n = 12 cells , P < 0 . 0001 ) . This observation is consistent with the critical role of the relative orientations of the donor / acceptor fluorescence transition dipole moments in the performance of FRET - based biosensors ( 20 ) . To further characterize R - G 1 – 10 – FluoSTEP - AKAR , which we re - named FluoSTEP - AKAR , in another cell type , we coexpressed the sensor with GFP 11 - actin in HeLa cells . Confocal fluorescence imag - ing revealed proper targeting of the biosensor to actin , as shown by the actin cytoskeletal structure visible in both the GFP and RFP channels ( Fig . 1D ) . After Fsk / IBMX stimulation , FluoSTEP - AKAR also produced a robust increase in red / green emission ratio in these cells (  R / R = 8 . 3 ± 0 . 70 % , t 1 / 2 = 0 . 99 ± 0 . 05 min , n = 13 cells ) ( Fig . 1D and table S1 ) . Subsequent addition of the PKA inhibitor H89 ( 10  M ) acutely reversed the emission ratio change , while mutating the phospho - acceptor threonine residue in FluoSTEP - AKAR to al - anine ( T / A ) largely abolished the emission ratio change induced by Fsk / IBMX stimulation (  R / R = 2 . 4 ± 0 . 50 % , n = 15 cells , P < 0 . 0001 ) , highlighting the specificity of the response ( Fig . 1D ) . To test the recruitment and functioning at a different POI , we coexpressed FluoSTEP - AKAR with GFP 11 - tagged clathrin ( GFP 11 - clathrin ) in HeLa cells and observed GFP reconstitution via confocal fluorescence microscopy , which highlighted clathrin microdomains along the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( Fig . 1E ) . Similar to the actin - targeted sensor , Fsk / IBMX stimulation triggered a robust increase in the FluoSTEP - AKAR red / green emission ratio (  R / R = 5 . 1 ± 0 . 92 % , t 1 / 2 = 1 . 2 ± 0 . 12 min , n = 8 cells ) , which was acutely reversed upon H89 addi - tion , while the FluoSTEP - AKAR ( T / A ) negative control construct showed no response to Fsk / IBMX treatment (  R / R = −0 . 24 ± 0 . 76 % , n = 21 cells ) ( Fig . 1E ) . Our complementation - dependent biosensor design thus enables robust activity measurements around specific POIs with minimal disruption of molecular organization . The FluoSTEP design can be generalized to multiple targets Many FRET - based biosensors are generated on the basis of a mod - ular design where a signal - specific conformational switch is sand - wiched between a pair of FPs . This modular architecture facilitates the straightforward assembly of a suite of sensors for detecting dif - ferent biological activities by simply swapping out the signal - specific switch domain ( 21 ) . We therefore took advantage of this feature to expand the FluoSTEP arsenal . For instance , most sensors designed to probe cAMP , the upstream regulator of PKA and a second messenger with diverse regulatory roles ( 22 ) , use the conformational change induced by the binding of cAMP to a single - protein domain ( 23 , 24 ) to modulate FRET between flanking FPs . Thus , to construct a FluoSTEP cAMP sensor , we tested cAMP - binding switches derived from the cAMP - binding domains of two different isoforms of exchange protein activated by cAMP ( Epac ) , Epac2B ( 285 to 443 ) ( 25 ) and Epac1 ( 149 to 881 ) ( 25 , 26 ) , inserted between mRuby2 and GFP 1 – 10 ( fig . S1 ) . Only the sensor containing Epac1 ( 149 to 881 ) produced an increase in the green / red emission ratio (  R / R = 4 . 1 ± 0 . 63 % , t 1 / 2 = 4 . 8 ± 0 . 44 min , n = 15 cells ; FRET efficiency change from 17 ± 1 % to 9 ± 1 % , n = 33 cells ) upon Fsk / IBMX addition in HEK293T cells coexpressing GFP 11 - actin and was thus named FluoSTEP - ICUE ( indicator of cAMP using Epac ) ( Fig . 2A ; fig . S1 , A and B ; and table S1 ) . FluoSTEP - ICUE tar - geted to the PM via GFP 11 fused to Lyn - tagged FK506 - binding pro - tein ( FKBP ) – rapamycin - binding domain ( FRB ) ( Lyn - FRB - GFP 11 ) also responded to  - adrenergic receptor (  - AR ) stimulation , pro - ducing an increase in the green / red emission ratio upon treatment with the  - AR agonist isoproterenol and showing identical kinetics to a previously developed PM - targeted cAMP indicator that uses the same switch domain as FluoSTEP - ICUE ( PM - ICUE3 ) ( fig . S1C ) ( 26 ) . As a negative control , the cAMP - binding site in Epac1 was mutated ( R279E ) . When coexpressed with GFP 11 - actin , FluoSTEP - ICUE ( R279E ) produced no change in emission ratio after Fsk / IBMX stimulation (  R / R = 0 . 52 ± 0 . 46 % , n = 22 cells , P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . In addition to PKA , many kinases are organized in macromolecular complexes and subcellularly targeted to tune signaling kinetics and target specificity ( 27 ) . For example , compartmentalization of Akt and C - jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , two kinases important within cellular survival and stress pathways , has been uncovered using FRET - based biosensors ( 28 – 30 ) . By simply swapping out the PKA substrate domain for the substrate sequences corresponding to Akt and JNK , we created FluoSTEP versions of the previously published Akt activity reporter ( AktAR ) ( 28 ) and JNK activity reporter ( JNKAR ) ( 29 ) , respectively . Upon activation of Akt via platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ; 50 ng / ml ) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing GFP 11 - actin , FluoSTEP - AktAR produced a 6 . 0 ± 0 . 90 % increase in the red / green emission ratio (  R / R , t 1 / 2 = 5 . 3 ± 0 . 1 min , n = 31 cells ; FRET efficiency change from 10 ± 4 % to 16 ± 3 % , n = 11 cells ) , while the nonphosphorylatable T / A mutant was nonresponsive (  R / R = −1 . 9 ± 1 . 2 % , n = 8 cells , P = 0 . 0002 ) ( Fig . 2B and table S1 ) . Similarly , upon stimulation of JNK activity with anisomycin ( 5  M ) , HeLa cells ex - pressing GFP 11 - actin and FluoSTEP - JNKAR showed a 6 . 8 ± 1 . 7 % increase in the red / green emission ratio (  R / R , t / 12 = 23 ± 1 . 8 min , n = 11 cells ; FRET efficiency change from 12 ± 5 % to 15 ± 4 % , n = 10 cells ) , in contrast to cells expressing GFP 11 - actin and the non - phosphorylatable T / A mutant (  R / R = −0 . 54 ± 0 . 73 % , n = 5 cells , P = 0 . 0018 ) ( Fig . 2C and table S1 ) . Other FRET - based kinase sen - sors use different substrate and PAABD pairs for the conformational switch . A FluoSTEP - EKAR ( Erk kinase activity reporter ) for Erk , a Tenner et al . , Sci .

In HEK293T cells coexpressing GFP 11 - actin and stimulated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ; 100 ng / ml ) to activate Erk , FluoSTEP - EKAR produced a 5 . 6 ± 0 . 99 % increase in the red / green emission ratio (  R / R , t 1 / 2 = 6 . 7 ± 0 . 18 min , n = 71 cells ; FRET efficiency change from 10 ± 3 % to 13 ± 2 % , n = 18 cells ) ( Fig . 2D and table S1 ) . As a negative control , the nonphosphorylatable FluoSTEP - EKAR ( T / A ) mutant showed no response (  R / R = 1 . 5 ± 0 . 49 % , n = 28 cells , P = 0 . 0003 ) . Enzyme activation biosensors often incorporate the targets of interest within their design architecture ( 32 ) , which can cause side effects from overexpression ( 33 ) . Thus , we hypothesized that FluoSTEPs could help untangle this dependence by uncoupling the expression of the target of interest from the rest of the sensor . As a prototype , we used the DORA RhoA sensor that measures the Fig . 2 . The FluoSTEP design can be generalized to probe multiple targets .

We created a FluoSTEP version of this RhoA activation sensor by splitting the sensor into two parts : one part con - taining the cpPKN interactor domain and the two FPs ( split sfGFP and mRuby2 ) , with an EV linker separating the FPs , and the other containing full - length RhoA tagged with GFP 11 at its N terminus , similar to the organization of DORA RhoA ( Fig . 2E ) . Expression of both parts reconstitutes the donor GFP to engage in FRET ( Fig . 2E ) . The FluoSTEP architecture for this sensor reversed the activity - induced FRET change ; therefore , we plotted the FluoSTEP - RhoA response as the increase in green / red emission ratio . Upon stimula - tion of RhoA activity via activation of the G  q - coupled histamine - 1 receptor through histamine ( 100  M ) addition in HeLa cells express - ing G  q - activatable p63 ( 6 , 34 ) , FluoSTEP - RhoA exhibited a 4 . 4 ± 0 . 95 % increase in the green / red emission ratio (  R / R , t 1 / 2 = 6 . 1 ± 0 . 29 min , n = 42 cells ; FRET efficiency change from 14 ± 4 % to 5 ± 2 % , n = 5 cells ) ( Fig . 2F and table S1 ) . In comparison , a FluoSTEP - RhoA ( L59Q ) negative control in which the cpPKN interactor domain was mutated to prevent binding to RhoA - GTP showed no response to histamine stimulation (  R / R = −0 . 20 ± 1 . 2 % , n = 24 cells , P = 0 . 0035 ) ( Fig . 2F ) . The design of FluoSTEP - RhoA could potentially be adapted for endogenous tagging of RhoA with GFP 11 and thus offer a strategy for monitoring RhoA activation at the endogenous level . Variants of FluoSTEP to increase dynamic range and brightness Having established the FluoSTEP design as a general approach for probing localized signaling activities , we next explored various strat - egies to improve biosensor performance , using FluoSTEP - AKAR as a template . We first exchanged the split sfGFP donor for a brighter , split version of mNeonGreen with an orthogonal FP 11 tag attached to clathrin ( 35 ) and tested the variant in HEK293T cells ; however , we observed a smaller dynamic range ( mNeonGreen : 4 . 1 ± 0 . 30 % , n = 9 cells ; sfGFP : 11 ± 1 . 4 % , n = 6 cells ; P < 0 . 0001 ) ( fig . S2A ) . We also replaced the mRuby2 acceptor in FluoSTEP - AKAR with brighter RFPs such as mRuby3 ( 36 ) or mScarlet - I ( 37 ) and tested these variants with GFP 11 - actin . While the mRuby3 - containing construct failed to produce a discernable response (  R / R = 2 . 2 ± 0 . 98 % , n = 7 cells ) ( fig . S2A ) , mScarlet - I did yield a sensor with an approximately twofold increased dynamic range versus the mRuby2 version (  R / R = 19 ± 0 . 38 % , n = 27 cells , P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 3A and fig . S2A ) . However , we observed that the mScarlet - I sensor exhibited a strong , diffuse green signal even in the absence of GFP donor reconstitution ( fig . S2 , B and C ) , possibly due to direct excitation of the bright mScarlet - I FP or incomplete fluorophore maturation ( 37 ) , which could be mitigated by applying calibration or choosing alternative imaging conditions . We then tested whether different FluoSTEP color variants can be developed for multiplexed applications . The donor GFP 1 – 10 was exchanged for two previously described sfGFP color variants ( 38 ) : yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP 1 – 10 ) and cyan fluorescent protein ( CFP 1 – 10 ) . We created a yellow - red version of FluoSTEP - AKAR by using YFP 1 – 10 as the donor and mRuby2 as the acceptor and a cyan - yellow version of FluoSTEP - AKAR by using CFP 1 – 10 as the donor and cpVenus from AKAR4 as the acceptor . In HEK293T cells coexpressing GFP 11 - actin and stimulated with Fsk / IBMX , cyan - yellow FluoSTEP - AKAR yielded a robust response (  R / R = 9 . 1 ± 1 . 2 % , Fig . 3 .

S2A ) . Fluorescence intensity is particularly important for targeted bio - sensing at endogenous proteins expressed at low levels ; thus , we set out to increase the brightness of our sensors . The split GFP system offers a unique approach for boosting the fluorescent signal by fusing multiple copies of the small GFP 11 tag in tandem ( 38 ) . We hypoth - esized that a similar strategy could be used to recruit multiple FluoSTEP copies and thus amplify the fluorescence intensity ( Fig . 3B ) ( 24 ) . We found that coexpressing actin fused to a seven - copy array of GFP 11 [ GFP 11 ( ×7 ) - actin ] along with FluoSTEP - AKAR in HeLa cells yielded an over fivefold increase in the brightness of the GFP channel versus GFP 11 ( ×1 ) - actin ( P < 0 . 0001 , n = 25 cells ) ( Fig . 3C ) , without affecting the Fsk / IBMX - induced response [ GFP 11 ( ×1 ) - actin :  R / R = 8 . 3 ± 0 . 70 % , n = 13 cells ; GFP 11 ( ×7 ) - actin :  R / R = 9 . 4 ± 0 . 90 % , n = 5 cells , P = 0 . 4217 ; Fig . 3D ) . The same strategy was applied to FluoSTEP - ICUE . By using an array of GFP 11 tags , we achieved a 3 . 6 - fold enhancement in the brightness of the GFP channel ( P < 0 . 0001 , n = 17 ) ( Fig . 3C ) . We also observed a 1 . 9 - fold enhancement in the dynamic range of FluoSTEP - ICUE when coexpressed with the GFP 11 array [ GFP 11 ( ×1 ) - actin :  R / R = 6 . 1 ± 0 . 54 % , n = 10 cells ; GFP 11 ( ×7 ) - actin :  R / R = 10 ± 0 . 64 % , n = 17 cells ; P < 0 . 0001 ] ( Fig . 3E ) . Together , these data indicate that recruiting an array of biosensors to a POI can be used to enhance the brightness of FluoSTEPs without de - grading probe sensitivity . Endogenous signaling compartments are accessible by FluoSTEPs To test our compartment - specific FluoSTEPs in an endogenous context , we sought to knock - in GFP 11 at a specific genomic locus in HEK293T cells . Because of the small size of GFP 11 , knock - in via CRISPR and homology - directed repair ( HDR ) with a single - stranded oligonucleotide donor is efficient and versatile and can theoretically be extended to multiple genomic loci of interest ( 38 , 39 ) . We pre - viously used FluoSTEP - AKAR and FluoSTEP - ICUE to measure the PKA activities and cAMP levels in endogenous type I - alpha regula - tory subunit of PKA ( RI  ) phase - separated bodies ( 13 ) , highlight - ing the utility of FluoSTEPs . To showcase the versatility of FluoSTEPs at endogenous POIs , we chose to measure cAMP and PKA dynamics around clathrin , which has a role in regulating cAMP / PKA signaling , as this scaffold protein is important in the early steps of endocytosis of receptors such as GPCRs . During endocytosis , clathrin - coated pits form at the PM ( 40 ) , which appear visually as discrete puncta ( 41 ) . After stabilization and maturation , these pits can bud off from the PM and traffic to early endosomes , with clathrin promptly dis - sociating from the vesicle and recycling back to the cytoplasm for subsequent endocytosis events ( 42 , 43 ) . When we expressed either FluoSTEP - AKAR or FluoSTEP - ICUE in clathrin light chain A ( CLTA ) – FP11 cells ( 38 ) , a HEK293T cell line in which the GFP 11 tag is knocked - in to the CLTA gene , the GFP donor was reconstituted and distinct clathrin - containing microdomains were observed , indicating cor - rect probe localization ( Fig . 4 , A and E ) . Localization to endoge - nously expressed clathrin did not negatively affect FluoSTEP - AKAR dynamic range compared to GPF 11 - clathrin overexpression , as Fsk / IBMX treatment reliably induced a rapid 16 ± 0 . 91 % increase in the red / green emission ratio (  R / R , n = 33 cells ) , which completely re - turned to baseline levels upon subsequent addition of H89 ( Fig . 4 , B and D ) . Similarly , treating FluoSTEP - ICUE – expressing CLTA - FP11 cells with Fsk / IBMX successfully triggered a rapid 12 ± 1 . 1 % in - crease in the green / red emission ratio (  R / R , n = 19 cells ) , demon - strating the utility of FluoSTEPs to monitor cAMP levels at clathrin microdomains ( Fig . 4 , C and D , and fig . S3A ) . Together , these re - sults confirm the utility of FluoSTEPs as a platform for monitoring compartmentalized signaling dynamics near specific target proteins expressed at endogenous levels from their native loci . Transmembrane ACs regulate sustained cAMP production at long - lived clathrin microdomains following  - AR stimulation After activation , GPCRs at the PM undergo desensitization , endo - cytosis and trafficking to endosomes , and eventual recycling back to the PM ( 40 ) . Evidence suggests that this process of GPCR endocy - tosis governs prolonged cAMP signaling from endosomes ( 44 ) . Clathrin plays a central role in the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP signaling by promoting GPCR internalization and trafficking Fig . 4 . FluoSTEPs deployed at endogenously expressed clathrin .

However , little is known about the receptor - mediated signal - ing within clathrin microdomains . To probe clathrin - specific cAMP dynamics after GPCR stimulation , we expressed FluoSTEP - ICUE in CLTA - FP11 cells and stimulated them with the  - AR agonist isoproterenol ( 10  M ) , followed by Fsk / IBMX to maximally induce cAMP production . Tagging with FluoSTEP - ICUE had little effect on endogenous clathrin dynamics , as assessed via total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) imaging of CLTA - FP11 cells transfected with either GFP 1 – 10 or FluoSTEP - ICUE ( movie S1 ; fig . S3 , B and C ) . While the median puncta lifetime observed via TIRF imaging was < 1 min ( fig . S3 , B and C ) , the isoproterenol - induced response from clathrin - targeted FluoSTEP - ICUE was largely sustained over 20 min [ sustained activity metric ( 46 ) 20 min after stimulation ( SAM20 ) = 0 . 90 ± 0 . 019 , n = 55 cells ; see Materials and Methods ] ( Fig . 5A ) . Clathrin microdomains are known to exhibit heterogeneous dynamics and can be roughly divided among smaller structures that are only transiently present ( 1 to 2 min ) at the mem - brane surface and other longer - lived structures known as clathrin plaques ( 47 , 48 ) . Our analysis of the cAMP dynamics within these different types of clathrin structures suggests that the sustained cAMP increases occur primarily in the longer - lived clathrin struc - tures ( fig . S3 , D and E ) . To compare the dynamics of clathrin microdomain - specific cAMP signaling with those of bulk cAMP signals , we transfected CLTA - FP11 cells with either untargeted or PM - targeted ICUE3 . Both ICUE3 and PM - ICUE3 reported transient cAMP accumulation upon isoproterenol stimulation , exhibiting sharp increases in the normal - ized ratio that gradually decayed to a submaximum steady state ( ICUE3 : SAM20 = 0 . 46 ± 0 . 026 , n = 40 cells ; PM - ICUE3 : SAM20 = 0 . 40 ± 0 . 022 , n = 42 cells ) ( Fig . 5A and fig . S4A ) , consistent with previous reports of cAMP clearance due to desensitization and in - ternalization during canonical  - AR signaling ( 23 ) . Reconstituting FluoSTEP - ICUE at the PM via Lyn - FRB - GFP 11 similarly revealed a transient response upon isoproterenol treatment ( SAM20 = 0 . 46 ± 0 . 21 , n = 45 cells ) ( fig . S4B ) , indicating that the sustained cAMP responses observed with clathrin - targeted FluoSTEP - ICUE were not an artifact of the complementation - based targeting strategy . We next set out to investigate the molecular mechanisms respon - sible for driving the unique compartmentalized cAMP dynamics that we observed within these endogenous clathrin microdomains . We hypothesized that the presence of sustained cAMP signaling might be driven by continuous signaling by active  - ARs ( 49 ) . To test this , we treated isoproterenol - stimulated CLTA - FP11 cells expressing either FluoSTEP - ICUE or PM - ICUE3 with the  - AR antagonist 2 - propranolol ( 10  M ) . Whereas propranolol treatment yielded an acute decrease in the normalized ratio of PM - ICUE3 (  R /  R max = −5 . 6 ± 0 . 64 % , n = 33 cells ) to almost basal levels , propranolol addition had no effect on the isoproterenol - induced response of clathrin - targeted FluoSTEP - ICUE (  R /  R max = −0 . 18 ± 0 . 14 % , n = 104 cells , P < 0 . 0001 ) , indicating that this sustained cAMP response does not require active receptors ( Fig . 5B ) . Local variations in cAMP accumulation within the cell can be controlled by the spatial organization of ACs and PDEs , which synthesize and degrade cAMP , respectively ( 22 ) , and the compart - mentalized cAMP dynamics observed using clathrin - targeted FluoSTEP - ICUE may be due to the differential distribution of these enzymes . For instance , AC3 and AC9 have been shown to undergo internalization after GPCR stimulation and traffic to endosomes containing the receptors ( 44 , 50 ) . Thus , to test the role of these enzymes in regulating the sustained cAMP accumulation detected by clathrin - targeted FluoSTEP - ICUE , we treated isoproterenol - stimulated CLTA - FP11 cells expressing FluoSTEP - ICUE or PM - ICUE3 with IBMX ( 100  M ) to acutely inhibit PDE activity or 2′ , 3′ - dideoxyadenosine ( ddAdo ; 100  M ) to acutely inhibit transmembrane AC activity . Whereas pan - PDE inhibition induced a large increase in the normal - ized ratio of PM - ICUE (  R /  R max = 44 ± 3 . 0 % , n = 36 cells ) , the response from clathrin - targeted FluoSTEP - ICUE was largely unaf - fected (  R /  R max = 3 . 1 ± 0 . 89 % , n = 32 cells , P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 5C ) . A similar trend was seen upon selective inhibition of PDE4 ( fig . S5 ) . On the other hand , transmembrane AC inhibition using ddAdo in - duced a sharp reversal of the normalized ratio of clathrin - targeted FluoSTEP - ICUE back to baseline levels (  R /  R max = −32 ± 1 . 5 % , n = 46 cells ) but had a minimal effect on the PM - ICUE3 response (  R /  R max = −4 . 2 ± 0 . 80 % , n = 54 cells , P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 5D ) . Together , these data suggest that the compartmentalized cAMP dy - namics associated with long - lived clathrin microdomains result from a combination of low PDE activity and high transmembrane AC activity leading to sustained cAMP accumulation following  - AR stimulation . DISCUSSION Here , we present FluoSTEPs , an adaptable biosensor framework for monitoring compartmentalized signaling at endogenous cellular locations , and deploy them to study a specific cAMP signaling microdomain . The complementation and functional reconstitution of the biosensors at endogenously tagged proteins rely on a logic gate and thus confer domain specificity . Efficient knock - in of GFP 11 at a specific genomic locus via CRISPR - mediated HDR ( 38 ) pre - cludes overexpression of the POI while also bypassing the need for knocking in an entire FRET - based sensor . In addition , the ratio - metric readout further strengthens the utility of this biosensor col - lection by allowing quantitative comparisons of localized signaling . Despite the demonstrated advantages of this platform , potential obstacles such as low - sensor dynamic range and the dependence on the level of endogenous protein expression must be considered . While we have demonstrated the ability to enhance FP reconstitution at an endogenous POI and amplify biosensor dynamic range using an array of GFP 11 tags , future development and engineering of FluoSTEPs will include linker optimization and additional FP screen - ing . For example , mScarlet - I incorporation into FluoSTEP - AKAR increased the dynamic range . Certain applications , where detecting subtle changes in signaling activities is required , might benefit from the enhanced dynamic range of the mScarlet - I – based sensor variant . While the cyan - yellow FluoSTEP - AKAR sensor ( fig . S2A ) produced comparable responses to green - red FluoSTEP - AKAR , the dim fluo - rescence of the reconstituted CFP currently limits the utility of this sensor . Future studies will focus on generating brighter split CFP variants . Furthermore , by extending the FluoSTEP toolkit to use orthogonal , multicolored FP variants , several sensors may be multi - plexed to simultaneously report differential compartmentalized sig - naling in the same cell . GPCR endocytosis starts a cascade of intricate signaling events such as activating a second wave of cAMP signaling ( 51 ) and is im - plicated in pathological processes such as opioid addiction ( 52 ) . While the kinetics of bulk cAMP accumulation during GPCR endo - cytosis have been characterized ( 53 ) , the dynamics of cAMP accu - mulation within the specific microdomains important in this process Tenner et al . , Sci .

Here , by deploying FluoSTEP - ICUE to probe cAMP dynamics at an endogenous signaling compartment , we were able to detect sustained cAMP accumulation within clathrin microdomains following  - AR activation . We show that this sustained cAMP accumulation primarily arises from a subset of long - lived clathrin structures known as plaques , a recently found class of clathrin struc - tures that persist in the membrane for longer periods than clathrin - coated pits ( 47 , 49 ) . Initially , clathrin plaques were thought to be biologically inert structures ( 48 , 54 ) ; however , recent work has shed light on their functional importance ( 55 – 57 ) . Clathrin plaques can recruit various GPCRs such as the  2 - AR ( 49 ) and also undergo typ - ical scission events ( 47 , 49 , 58 ) . Furthermore , these longer - lasting clathrin structures are implicated in various cellular processes such as mechanotransduction ( 57 , 59 ) and sarcomere organization and function ( 55 , 56 ) . Our results shed more light onto the signaling role of long - lived clathrin structures such as plaques by suggesting that they play an important role in regulating local cAMP dynamics . The sustained cAMP elevations within clathrin plaques are likely achieved by the exclusion or inhibition of PDEs and by the recruitment of ACs with the endocytosed receptor , consistent with previous reports of G  s and AC cointernalization with GPCRs ( 44 , 50 , 60 ) . Notably , our studies were performed in HEK293T cells , and the unique cAMP dynamics we observed within these clathrin structures may differ in other cell types depending on the expression of specific ACs isoforms and other cAMP effectors in this microdomain ( 61 , 62 ) . Compared with canonical PM GPCR signaling , other sources of GPCR signal - ing , including from endosomes , produce distinct signaling profiles and dictate different cellular processes , such as cAMP - dependent transcription ( 63 – 65 ) . Future studies of the cAMP signaling origi - nating within the clathrin microdomains versus the general PM ( Fig . 5 and figs . S3 and S4 ) may thus reveal unique downstream sig - naling effects and cellular functions regulated by these closely juxta - posed membrane compartments . We envision that FluoSTEPs can be further used to probe many specific GPCR compartments and Fig . 5 . Transmembrane ACs regulate sustained cAMP production at clathrin after  - AR stimulation .

In summary , FluoSTEPs provide a strategy for observing micro - domain - specific signaling at endogenous protein expression levels . Using FluoSTEPs to elucidate a unique cAMP compartment asso - ciated with clathrin microdomains uncovers new aspects of cAMP regulation during GPCR internalization and highlights the utility of FluoSTEPs to advance our understanding of the spatiotemporal regu - lation of biochemical networks in endogenous biological contexts .

Cell culture and transfection HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Gibco ) containing glucose ( 1 g / liter ) and supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 1 % ( v / v ) penicillin - streptomycin ( Pen - Strep ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM ( Gibco ) containing glucose ( 1 g / liter ) and supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum and 1 % ( v / v ) Pen - Strep ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Before transfection , cells were plated onto sterile 35 - mm glass - bottomed dishes and grown to 50 to 70 % confluence . Cells were then trans - fected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) or PolyJet ( SignaGen Laboratories ) and grown an additional 24 hours ( HeLa , HEK293T ) before imaging . NIH3T3 cells were changed to serum - free DMEM immediately before transfection and serum - starved for 24 hours before imaging . Generation of stable GFP 11 cell lines via CRISPR - mediated knock - in For knock - in experiments , 200 ng of Cas9 + single guide RNA vector ( designed with px330 ) and 400 ng of an oligonucleotide donor DNA were transfected to HEK293FT cells ( 50 % confluence ) per well in a 24 - well plate ( Eppendorf ) . For CLTA , transient transfection of GFP 1 – 10 and fluorescence - activated cell sorting enrichment for GFP + cells were performed , followed by a negative sort 2 weeks later to select against stable incorporation of GFP 1 – 10 . Genomic DNA was extracted from cells and sequenced to confirm knock - in . Time - lapse fluorescence imaging Cells were washed twice with Hank’s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ; Gibco ) and subsequently imaged in HBSS in the dark at 37°C . Fsk ( Calbiochem ) , IBMX ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , PDGF ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , anisomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , EGF ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , histamine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , isoproterenol ( Sigma ) , 2 - propranolol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and ddAdo ( Cayman Chemical ) were added as indicated . Epifluorescence imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a xenon lamp , a 40× / 1 . 3 nu - merical aperture objective and an Orca - FLASH 4 . 0LT digital CMOS camera ( Hammamatsu ) and controlled by METAFLUOR 7 . 7 soft - ware ( Molecular Devices ) . The following excitation / emission filter combinations ( center / bandwidth in nanometer ) were used : CFP , EX420 / 20 and EM475 / 25 ; GFP , EX480 / 30 and EM535 / 45 ; YFP , EX495 / 10 and EM535 / 25 ; RFP , EX568 / 55 and EM653 / 95 ; C - Y FRET , EX420 / 20 and EM535 / 25 ; G - R FRET , EX480 / 30 and EM653 / 95 . All filter sets were alternated using a Lambda 10 - 2 filter - changer ( Sutter Instruments ) . Exposure times were 50 ms ( for acceptor di - rect channel ) and 500 ms ( for all other channels ) , and images were acquired every 30 s . All epifluorescence experiments were subse - quently analyzed using METAFLUOR 7 . 7 software . Raw fluorescence images were corrected by subtracting the background fluorescence intensity of a cell - free region from the emission intensities of biosensor - expressing cells at each time point . Emission ratios were then calculated at each time point . Biosensor response time courses shown in Figs . 1 to 4 and fig . S1 were subsequently plotted as the normalized emission ratio with respect to time zero ( e . g . , R / R 0 ) , where R is the ratio value at a given time point , and R 0 is the initial ratio value at the time point immediately preceding drug addition or the average emission ra - tio ( −5 to 0 min ) before drug addition . Biosensor responses shown in Fig . 5 and figs . S3D and S4 were plotted as the normalized - to - max emission ratio change (  R /  R max ) , calculated as ( R − R 0 ) / ( R max − R 0 ) , where R and R 0 are defined as above , and R max is the maxi - mum ratio value recorded after Fsk / IBMX stimulation . Maximum ratio (  R / R ) changes shown in Figs . 1 to 4 and figs . S1 and S2 were calculated as ( R max − R min ) / R min , where R max and R min are the maximum and minimum ratio value recorded after stimulation , respectively . Sustained activity levels in Fig . 5A and fig . S3D were assessed using the SAM20 or at 15 min ( SAM15 ) , calculated as ( R t − R 0 ) / ( R max , t − R 0 ) , where R t is the ratio value recorded either 20 min after stimulation for SAM20 or 15 min after stimulation for SAM15 , R max , t is the maximum ratio value recorded within either the 20 - min window for SAM20 or 15 - min window for SAM15 , and R 0 is the ratio value at t = 0 . Graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8 ( GraphPad Software ) . Acceptor photobleaching to measure FRET efficiencies Epifluorescence time course imaging of cells expressing GFP 11 - actin and the different FluoSTEPs were performed using the GFP / RFP FRET , GFP , and RFP channels and the 0 . 3 neutral density ( ND ) filter . At the end of the experiment , acceptor photobleaching was per - formed by illuminating RFP without any ND filters for 10 min . After confirming that most of the RFP is photobleached , images were taken with the 0 . 3 ND filter . FRET efficiency was calculated as 1 − ( GFP before / GFP after ) , where GFP before and GFP after are the GFP intensities before and after acceptor photobleaching , respectively . For calculating the FRET efficiency before drug stimulation , the GFP intensity right be - fore drug stimulation was used as GFP before ; for calculating the FRET efficiency after drug stimulation , the GFP intensity right before accep - tor photobleaching was used as GFP before . TIRF imaging and analysis CLTA - FP 11 cells were plated onto glass - bottom 35 - mm dishes coated with poly - d - lysine ( 100  g / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were transfected 24 hours after plating and then incubated an additional 24 hours after transfection . Cells were imaged using a 488 - nm laser on a Nikon A1R TIRF microscope using a 100× objective at a 1840 TIRF angle with 20 % laser power , gain multiplier of 300 , and 2 - s interval time . TIRF image for single - particle tracking of the clathrin - coated structures was analyzed via Fiji plugin TrackMate ( 69 ) . Single clathrin - coated structures in each frame were detected using LoGdetector with 3 pixels of estimated blob diameter . Detected clathrin - coated structures were linked to get the trajectory by linear assignment problem ( LAP ) tracker , with the gap closing after arbitrary thresh - olding of dot detection for each sample . The lifetimes of single clathrin - coated structures were estimated by the durations of their trajectories . Tenner et al . , Sci .
