This activity comprises a cathepsin B ( Tb CATB ) and a cathepsin L ( Tb CATL ) . Previous RNA interference ( RNAi ) data suggest that Tb CATB rather than Tb CATL is essential to survival even though silencing of the latter was incomplete . Also , chemical evidence supporting the essentiality of either enzyme which would facilitate a target - based drug development programme is lacking . Using speciﬁc peptidyl inhibitors and substrates , we quantiﬁed the contributions of Tb CATB and Tb CATL to the survival of T . brucei . At 100 l M , the min - imal inhibitory concentration that kills all parasites in culture , the non - speciﬁc cathepsin inhibitors , benzyloxycarbonyl - phenylalanyl - arginyl - diazomethyl ketone ( Z - FA - diazomethyl ketone ) and ( L - 3 - trans - propylcarbamoyloxirane - 2 - carbonyl ) - L - isoleucyl - L - proline methyl ester ( CA - 074Me ) inhibited Tb CATL and Tb CATB by > 99 % . The cathepsin L ( CATL ) - speciﬁc inhibitor , ( ( 2 S , 3 S ) - oxirane - 2 , 3 - dicarbox - ylic acid 2 - [ ( ( S ) - 1 - benzylcarbamoyl - 2 - phenyl - ethyl ) - amide ] 3 - { [ 2 - ( 4 - hydroxy - phenyl ) - ethyl ] - amide } ) ( CAA0225 ) , killed parasites with > 99 % inhibition of Tb CATL but only 70 % inhibition of Tb CATB . Con - versely , the cathepsin B ( CATB ) - speciﬁc inhibitor , ( L - 3 - trans - propylcarbamoyloxirane - 2 - carbonyl ) - L - iso - leucyl - L - proline ( CA - 074 ) , did not affect survival even though Tb CATB inhibition at > 95 % was statistically indistinguishable from the complete inhibition by Z - FA - diazomethyl ketone and CA - 074Me . The observed inhibition of Tb CATL by CA - 074 and CA - 074Me was shown to be facilitated by the reducing intracellular environment . All inhibitors , except the CATB - speciﬁc inhibitor , CA - 074 , blockaded lysosomal hydrolysis prior to death . The results suggest that Tb CATL , rather than Tb CATB , is essential to the survival of T . brucei and an appropriate drug target . (cid:2) 2012 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc .

The pathogen is transmitted by the bite of infected tsetse ﬂies ( Glossina sp . ) and multiplies extracellularly in the blood and tissue ﬂuids of the human host . Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is responsible for the chronic form of sleeping sickness in western and central Africa whereas Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense causes the acute form of the disease in eastern and southern Africa ( Barrett et al . , 2003 ) . Currently over 60 million people living in 36 sub - Saharan countries are at risk of contracting the disease ( Barrett et al . , 2003 ; Steverding , 2008 ; Brun et al . , 2010 ) . Due to reinforced surveillance , the number of new cases reported has fall - en and at present the estimated number of infected patients is thought to be approximately 30 , 000 ( World Health Organization , 2010 ) . If left untreated , HAT is fatal . Current chemotherapy is unsatis - factory as only four drugs ( suramin , pentamidine , melarsoprol and eﬂornithine ) are approved for use ( Fairlamb , 2003 ; Steverding , 2010 ) . Also , these drugs have toxic side effects and the occurrence of drug - resistant trypanosome strains is a growing problem ( Matovu et al . , 2001 ; Fairlamb , 2003 ; Delespaux and de Koning , 2007 ) . Hence , there is an urgent need to develop new drugs for the treatment of HAT . Research over the last decade has shown that targeting Clan CA Family C1 cysteine peptidase ( CP ) activity ( Rawlings et al . , 2010 ) 0020 - 7519 / $ 36 . 00 (cid:2) 2012 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc .

First characterised in the 1980s , the CP activity comprises a major cathepsin L activity ( North et al . , 1983 , 1990 ; Lonsdale - Eccles and Grab , 1987 ; Robert - son et al . , 1990 ) , termed Tb CATL ( earlier referred to as rhodesain , brucipain or Trypanopain - Tb depending on the report and parasite sub - species ; Caffrey and Steverding , 2009 ) . Tb CATL is expressed in both mammalian and insect life cycle stages of T . brucei ( Pamer et al . , 1989 ; Caffrey et al . , 2001 ) and is localised to the lysosomes , at least in bloodstream forms ( Lonsdale - Eccles and Grab , 1987 ; Scory et al . , 1999 ) . Studies with small - molecule CP inhibitors to kill trypanosomes ( e . g . , Scory et al . , 1999 ; Troeberg et al . , 1999 ; Nkemngu et al . , 2003 ) were originally thought to target only Tb CATL . However , the dis - covery and RNA interference ( RNAi ) validation of a minor ( in terms of overall CP activity ) , yet essential , T . brucei cathepsin B ( Tb CATB ) in vitro ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ) and in vivo ( Abdulla et al . , 2008 ) raised the possibility that it was the chemical inhibition of Tb CATB , rather than Tb CATL , that was responsible for lethality . The sugges - tion was supported by the ﬁnding that RNAi of Tb CATL produced no in vitro phenotype ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ) and that in vivo , although RNAi of Tb CATL prolonged the survival of infected mice , it was insufﬁcient for ﬁnal rescue ( Abdulla et al . , 2008 ) . As a con - sequence , subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts have gravitated toward improving inhibitor speciﬁcity for Tb CATB ( Mallari et al . , 2008a , 2009 ) . Scrutiny of the previous data ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ; Abdulla et al . , 2008 ) reveals that RNAi of Tb CATL in vitro and in vivo never re - sulted in complete silencing but approximately a 60 – 65 % reduction of protein . Accordingly , suggestions that Tb CATL is not essential to the parasite ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ; Abdulla et al . , 2008 ) are open to re - interpretation . This incomplete RNAi of Tb CATL and the absence of rigorous chemical evidence for or against the enzyme’s essential nature ( even though complete or partial loss of CATL activity using CP inhibitors is consistently associated with parasite death , as referenced above ) impede crucial insight into its utility as a drug target and perhaps the possibility that targeting both Tb CATL and Tb CATB with small - molecule inhibitors may prove additively or even better , synergistically , trypanocidal . Here , we employ a number of small - molecule CP inhibitors and peptidyl substrates with varying speciﬁcities for mammalian CATL or CATB in order to chemically correlate parasite killing with inhi - bition of Tb CATL or Tb CATB . We show that ( i ) the speciﬁcities understood for the inhibitors and peptidyl substrates of human en - zymes also hold for the trypanosome orthologs and ( ii ) inhibitor potency can be modulated by the presence or absence of a reduc - ing environment . For those trypanocidal inhibitors , cell death is al - ways preceded by the accumulation of ﬂuorescently - labelled transferrin in the lysosome ( Scory et al . , 1999 ; Nkemngu et al . , 2003 ) . Based on our ﬁndings , we offer a brief perspective on the fu - ture of anti - trypanosomal CP inhibitor development that attempts to balance the time and resources required to improve on - target inhibitor speciﬁcity with the pertinent need for pharmaceutical optimisation . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . CP substrates and inhibitors Benzyloxycarbonyl - phenylalanyl - arginyl - diazomethyl ketone ( Z - FA - DMK ) was from Bachem , ( Germany ) . ( L - 3 - trans - Propylcarba - moyloxirane - 2 - carbonyl ) - L - isoleucyl - L - proline ( CA - 074 ) and the methyl ester version of CA - 074 ( CA - 074Me ) were from Sigma – Aldrich , ( UK ) . The ﬂuorogenic substrates , benzyloxycarbonyl - arginyl - arginyl - 7 - amido - 4 - methyl coumarin ( Z - RR - AMC ) and benzyloxycarbonyl - phenylalanyl - arginyl - 7 - amido - 4 - methyl cou - marin ( Z - FR - AMC ) , were purchased from BIOMOL , ( UK ) . ( ( 2 S , 3 S ) - Oxirane - 2 , 3 - dicarboxylic acid 2 - [ ( ( S ) - 1 - benzylcarba - moyl - 2 - phenyl - ethyl ) - amide ] 3 - { [ 2 - ( 4 - hydroxy - phenyl ) - ethyl ] - amide } ) ( CAA0225 ; Tamai et al . , 1987 ; Takahashi et al . , 2009 ) , was synthesised according to a synthetic strategy previously re - ported by James et al . ( 2004 ) for structurally related aza - peptide epoxides . In Fig . 1 step 1 , the central synthetic building block , ( 2 S , 3 S - diethyl - oxirane - 2 , 3 - dicarboxylate ) , was mono - deprotected with 1 M KOH in ethanol . The resulting oxirane - 2 - carboxylic acid was converted into the corresponding amide using the mixed anhy - dride method ( Fig . 1 step 2 ) . Deprotection of the remaining ester group and coupling of the resulting carboxylic acid to L - phenylala - nine benzylamide ( Ramalingam et al . , 2007 ) afforded CAA0225 as a white solid with moderate yield . The molecular structure of CAA0225 was conﬁrmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H - NMR ) and high - resolution mass spectrometry ( HRMS ) . 2 . 2 . Recombinant TbCATB and T . b . rhodesiense CATL ( TbrCATL ) Recombinant Tb CATB was expressed in Pichia pastoris and puriﬁed from growth medium using Mono Q anion - exchange CAA0225 1 ( i ) , ( ii ) 2 ( iii ) , ( iv ) Fig . 1 . Synthetic route for ( ( 2 S , 3 S ) - oxirane - 2 , 3 - dicarboxylic acid 2 - [ ( ( S ) - 1 - benzylc - arbamoyl - 2 - phenyl - ethyl ) - amide ] 3 - { [ 2 - ( 4 - hydroxy - phenyl ) - ethyl ] - amide } ) ( CAA0225 ) . In the ﬁrst step ( i ) , one of the ester groups in 1 was hydrolysed under basic conditions using KOH as the base . In the next step ( ii ) , standard aminoacid coupling conditions with tyramine , hydroxybenzotriazole ( HOBt ) , N - methylmorpholine ( NMM ) and 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) gave the protected intermediate 2 . Finally , CAA0225 was obtained from 2 by removal of the second ester group ( iii ) , followed by coupling to L - phenylalanine benzylamide under standard amino acid coupling conditions ( iv ) . Conditions : ( i ) KOH ( 1 . 0 eq . , 0 . 1 M in ethanol ) , 4 (cid:3) C , 3 h , 82 % ; ( ii ) tyramine ( 1 . 2 eq . ) , HOBt ( 1 . 0 eq . ) , EDC ( 1 . 2 eq . ) , NMM ( 1 . 0 eq . ) , CHCl 3 , 0 (cid:3) C to room temperature , 16 h , 60 % ; ( iii ) KOH ( 1 . 2 eq . , 0 . 1 M inethanol ) , 4 (cid:3) C , 3 h , 40 % ; ( iv ) L - phenylalanine benzylamide ( 1 . 1 eq . ) , HOBt ( 1 . 0 eq . ) , EDC ( 1 . 2 eq . ) , CHCl 3 , 0 (cid:3) C to room temperature , 16 h , 17 % . 482 D . Steverding et al . / International Journal for Parasitology 42 ( 2012 ) 481 – 488 chromatography as detailed previously ( O’Brien et al . , 2008 ) . Re - combinant Tbr CATL ( aka rhodesain ) was also expressed in P . pasto - ris and the recombinant proteolytic activity left overnight at 37 (cid:3) C in the presence of DTT to ‘clear’ the solution of incompletely pro - cessed forms of rhodesain and contaminating proteins ( Caffrey et al . , 2001 ) . The enzyme solutions were desalted using PD10 col - umns and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:3) C until use . 2 . 3 . Cell proliferation assay Bloodstream forms of T . brucei clone 427 – 221a ( Hirumi et al . , 1980 ) were grown in Baltz medium ( Baltz et al . , 1985 ) supple - mented with 16 . 7 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated FBS . The cultures were maintained in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:3) C . To evaluate the trypanocidal activities of inhibitors , blood - stream forms of T . brucei were seeded at an initial density of 10 4 cells / ml into a 24 - well plate in 1 ml of medium containing various concentrations of inhibitors and 1 % DMSO as solvent . Wells containing trypanosomes , medium and 1 % DMSO served as controls . After 48 h incubation , live trypanosomes were counted using a haemocytometer . The 50 % growth inhibition va - lue ( GI 50 ) , i . e . , the inhibitor concentration necessary to reduce the growth rate of the cells by 50 % of that of controls , was deter - mined by linear interpolation according to Huber and Koella ( 1993 ) . The minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , i . e . , the lowest concentration of inhibitor at which all cells are killed , was determined microscopically . 2 . 4 . CP activity assays For determination of half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) values for CA - 074 and CAA0255 , activities of recombinant Tb CATB and Tbr CATL were assayed with 10 l M of Z - FR - AMC in measuring buffer ( 100 mM citrate , pH 5 . 0 , 2 mM DTT ) . First , the enzymes were pre - incubated in 100 mM citrate , pH 5 . 0 , with dif - ferent concentrations of CA - 074 or CAA0225 ( 10 nM – 100 l M ) for 5 min . Then , 50 l l of the enzyme solution was added to 1950 l l of measuring buffer containing the same inhibitor concentration and 10 l M of Z - FR - AMC . The ﬁnal enzyme concentrations in the assays were 57 l g / ml for Tb CATB and 0 . 061 l g / ml for Tbr CATL . After 10 min , the ﬂuorescence of released AMC was measured as described below . IC 50 values were determined by linear interpola - tion according to Huber and Koella ( 1993 ) . The effect of CA - 074 , CA - 074Me and CAA0225 on the catalytic activity of recombinant Tb CATB and Tbr CATL was determined by pre - incubating the enzymes ( 2 . 3 mg / ml and 2 l g / ml , respectively ) with 100 l M of inhibitor in 100 mM citrate , pH 5 . 0 , 10 % DMSO , in the presence or absence of 1 . 5 mM of DTT for 2 h . Controls were pre - treated with 10 % DMSO alone or with 100 l M of Z - FA - DMK in the presence or absence of 1 . 5 mM of DTT for the same period of time . Then , 50 l l of the enzyme solution were added to 1950 l l of measuring buffer containing 10 l M of Z - FR - AMC . The ﬁ - nal enzyme concentration in the assay was 57 . 5 l g / ml for Tb CATB and 0 . 04 l g / ml for Tbr CATL . After 60 min ( Tb CATB ) or 10 min ( Tbr CATL ) , the ﬂuorescence of released AMC was measured as described below . The effects of CA - 074 , CA - 074Me and CAA0225 on CP activity within trypanosomes and in cell extracts were determined as follows . Live cells ( 1 (cid:3) 10 7 / ml ) were incubated with 100 l M of CA - 074 , CA - 074Me or CAA0225 in the presence of 1 % DMSO at 37 (cid:3) C . Control cultures were treated with 1 % DMSO alone or with 100 l M of Z - FA - DMK . After a 2 h incubation , cells were washed three times with PBS / 1 % glucose and lysed in 100 mM citrate , pH 5 . 0 , 2 % 3 - [ ( 3 - cholamidopropyl ) dimethylammonio ] - 1 - propanesulf - onate hydrate ( CHAPS ) ( 10 7 cells / 100 l l ) . Alternatively , cells were ﬁrst harvested , washed twice with PBS / 1 % glucose and lysed in 100 mM citrate , pH 5 . 0 , 2 % CHAPS ( 10 7 cells / 100 l l ) . After centrifugation , clariﬁed cell extracts ( 9 (cid:3) 10 6 for Tb CATB activity or 2 (cid:3) 10 6 for Tb CATL activity ) were pre - incubated with 100 l M of CA - 074 , CA - 074Me or CAA0255 , in the presence of 10 % DMSO and in the presence or absence of 1 . 5 mM of DTT at room temperature for 2 h . Controls were pre - treated with 10 % DMSO alone or with 100 l M of Z - FA - DMK in the presence or absence of 1 . 5 mM of DTT for the same period of time . Then 50 l l ( for Tb CATB activity ) and 10 l l ( for Tb CATL activity ) of cell lysate were added to 1950 l l and 1990 l l of measuring buffer containing 10 l M of Z - RR - AMC and Z - FR - AMC , respectively . The amount of enzyme source in the assay corresponded to 4 . 5 – 5 (cid:3) 10 6 and 1 (cid:3) 10 6 cell equivalents for Tb CATB and Tb CATL activity , respectively . After 60 min ( Tb CATB ) or 10 min ( Tbr CATB ) , the ﬂuorescence of released AMC was measured as described below . After the respective incubation time at room temperature , the CP reaction was terminated by adding the alkylating agent and CP inhibitor , iodoacetic acid , to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM . Re - lease of free 7 - amino - 4 - methylcoumarin ( AMC ) was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm in a BIO - RAD VersaFluor ﬂuorometer . Data were calculated as speciﬁc activ - ities ( nmol AMC released / min ) using a standard curve constructed with uncoupled AMC . 2 . 5 . Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed as previously described ( Steverding et al . , 2009 ) . Bloodstream - form trypanosomes ( 8 (cid:3) 10 6 / ml ) were incubated with 50 l g / ml of ﬂuorescein - labelled bovine transferrin in Baltz medium supplemented with 2 % BSA and 100 l M of CA - 074 , CA - 074Me or CAA0225 in the presence of 1 % DMSO . Control cultures were treated with 1 % DMSO alone ( nega - tive control ) or with 100 l M of Z - FA - DMK ( positive control ) . After 2 h incubation , cells were washed three times with PBS / 1 % glucose , ﬁxed with 2 % formaldehyde / 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde in PBS and ﬂuo - rescence was quantiﬁed with a BD Accuri C6 ﬂow cytometer . The excitation wavelength was 488 nm and the ﬁlter set was 530 / 30 nm . Gates were set to exclude cell fragments and debris from the analysis , and 108 , 000 gated cells were analysed . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . Inhibitors and substrates , and their speciﬁcities for trypanosome cathepsins compared with mammalian cathepsins The epoxysuccinyl CP inhibitor , CA - 074 ( Fig . 2 ) , is 77 , 000 - fold more potent against mammalian CATB ( IC 50 = 2 . 24 nM ) than CATL ( IC 50 = 172 , 000 nM ) ( Murata et al . , 1991 ) . Likewise , we found a similar inhibition pattern for Tb CATB and Tbr CATL ( Table 1 ) : whereas Tb CATB is strongly inhibited by CA - 074 , the activity of Tbr CATL is unaffected by the inhibitor . Due to a charged carboxylic acid moiety , CA - 074 is membrane - impermeable and cannot enter cells ( Bogyo et al . , 2000 ) . To allow for cell - permeability , CA - 074 was synthesised as a methyl ester , CA - 074Me ( Fig . 2 ) with the expectation that non - speciﬁc intracel - lular esterases would convert the inhibitor to the active acid form ( Buttle et al . , 1991 ) . However , CA - 074Me is neither speciﬁc for CATB nor CATL ( Montaser et al . , 2002 ) . CAA0225 ( Fig . 1 ) is another epoxysuccinyl CP that strongly inhibits rat liver CATL but not CATB ( IC 50 value of 1 . 9 versus 5 , 000 nM , respectively ; Takahashi et al . , 2009 ) . This compound is sufﬁciently hydrophobic to penetrate biological membranes and enter cells ( Takahashi et al . , 2009 ) . Likewise , we found CAA0225 D . Steverding et al . / International Journal for Parasitology 42 ( 2012 ) 481 – 488 483 to be a potent inhibitor of Tbr CATL , while the compound was inac - tive against Tb CATB ( Table 1 ) . Z - FA - DMK ( Fig . 2 ) inactivates both CATB and CATL ( Shaw , 1990 ) and was used in this study as a positive control for the inhibition of Tb CATB and Tb CATL activities . Z - RR - AMC is selective for CATB among mammalian lysosomal CPs under acid pH conditions ; it is not hydrolysed by CATL ( Barrett and Kirschke , 1981 ) . Likewise , Z - RR - AMC is hydrolysed by Tb CATB ( O’Brien et al . , 2008 ) but not by Tbr CATL ( Caffrey et al . , 2001 ) . Z - FR - AMC is cleaved by mammalian CATB and CATL ( Barrett and Kirschke , 1981 ) , and by Tb CATB ( O’Brien et al . , 2008 ) and Tbr CATL ( Caffrey et al . , 2001 ) . However , the potency of Tb CATB to cleave Z - FR - AMC was approximately 1 , 000 - fold less than that of Tbr CATL ( 0 . 41 and 395 nmol / min / l g of protein , respectively ; Table 1 ) . This is in contrast to human CATB and CATL which cleave Z - FR - AMC with almost the same efﬁciency ( 467 and 437 nmol / min / l g of protein , respectively ; Steverding , 2011 ) . The difference in speciﬁc activity of Tb CATB and human CATB may be due to sequence diver - gence of both enzymes ( Kerr et al . , 2010 ) . It should also be noted that Tb CATB cleaves Z - FR - AMC ﬁve times faster than Z - RR - AMC ( data not shown ) . Based on k cat / K m values , a similar difference ( threefold ) in substrate speciﬁcity was previously reported for Tb CATB ( O’Brien et al . , 2008 ) and human CATB ( Barrett and Kirschke , 1981 ) . 3 . 2 . Potent trypanocidal activity in vitro by all inhibitors except CA - 074 CA - 074Me and CAA0225 inhibited the growth of trypanosomes in a dose - dependent manner with GI 50 values of 3 . 70 ± 0 . 27 and 0 . 33 ± 0 . 09 l M , respectively , and MIC values of 100 l M ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , the CATL - speciﬁc inhibitor CAA0225 displayed 11 - fold great - er trypanocidal activity than the non - speciﬁc inhibitor CA - 074Me . In addition , the GI 50 value of CAA0225 is in good agreement with the IC 50 value of the inhibitor for Tb CATL ( Table 1 ) . The results are consistent with the previous demonstration of potent killing ( GI 50 values between 0 . 018 and 0 . 126 l M ) by dipeptidyl aldehyde and diazomethyl ketone inhibitors of greater speciﬁcity for mammalian CATL ( Nkemngu et al . , 2003 ) . In striking contrast to the other inhibitors , the CATB - speciﬁc inhibitor , CA - 074 , had no effect on trypanosome growth when tested at 100 l M – a concen - tration at which all parasites were killed by CA - 074Me and CAA0225 ( Fig . 3 ) . 3 . 3 . TbCATB activity is not essential for the bloodstream form of T . brucei in vitro To understand whether the absence of trypanocidal activity by CA - 074 was due to a lack of uptake by the parasite and whether killing by the other inhibitors was due more to inhibition of Tb CATB or Tb CATL activity , each inhibitor was co - incubated with the parasite for 2 h at the lethal concentration of 100 l M and the residual peptidase activity in cell extracts measured using Z - RR - AMC and Z - FR - AMC . Using Z - RR - AMC , the non - selective CP inhibitor , Z - FA - DMK , inhibited hydrolysis by 80 % ( Table 2 ) suggesting that 80 % inhibition is the maximum achievable . The remaining 20 % activity could be inhibited by leupeptin , but not by phenylmethanesulfo - nylﬂuoride ( PMSF ) and E - 64 , indicative of a previously described Table 1 Half maximal inhibition concentration ( IC 50 ) values of ( L - 3 - trans - propylcarbamoy - loxirane - 2 - carbonyl ) - L - isoleucyl - L - proline ( CA - 074 ) and ( ( 2 S , 3 S ) - oxirane - 2 , 3 - dicar - boxylic acid 2 - [ ( ( S ) - 1 - benzylcarbamoyl - 2 - phenyl - ethyl ) - amide ] 3 - { [ 2 - ( 4 - hydroxy - phenyl ) - ethyl ] - amide } ) ( CAA0225 ) for inhibition of recombinant Trypanosoma brucei cathepsin B ( Tb CATB ) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense cathepsin L ( Tbr CATL ) . Activity of recombinant enzymes was determined in measuring buffer ( 100 mM citrate , pH 5 . 0 , 2 mM DTT and 10 l M benzyloxycarbonyl - phenylalanyl - arginyl - 7 - amido - 4 - methyl coumarin ( Z - FR - AMC ) as substrate ) in the presence or absence of inhibitors . The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme pre - incubated with inhibitor in 100 mM citrate , pH 5 . 0 , for 5 min , to measuring buffer containing the same concentration of inhibitor . After 10 min , the ﬂuorescence of liberated 7 - amino - 4 - methylcoumarin ( AMC ) was measured . Data are the mean ± S . D . of three experi - ments . The speciﬁc activity of recombinant Tb CATB and Tbr CATL was 0 . 41 ± 0 . 02 and 395 ± 93 nmol / min / l g , respectively .

Bloodstream - form trypanosomes were incubated at a density of 10 4 cells / ml with varying concentrations of CA - 074 ( triangle ) , CA - 074Me ( circles ) and CAA0225 ( squares ) . After 48 h of culture , living cells were counted using a Neubauer haemocytometer . The experiment was repeated three times and means ± S . D . values are shown .

Steverding et al . / International Journal for Parasitology 42 ( 2012 ) 481 – 488 oligopeptidase B activity ( Troeberg et al . , 1996 ; data not shown ) . Accordingly , the data in Table 2 with Z - RR - AMC were normalised to remove this contribution by oligopeptidase B . CA - 074Me was as effective as Z - FA - DMK in completely inhibit - ing Tb CATB activity . CAA0225 partially inhibited Tb CATB activity by 71 % based on normalised values , indicating that in spite of being more speciﬁc for mammalian CATL or Tb CATL ( Table 1 ; Takahashi et al . , 2009 ) in biochemical assays there is substantial inhibition of Tb CATB in trypanosomes . This is possibly due to a time - dependent accumulation in cells of a sufﬁciently inhibitory concentration . It is reasonable to assume that this and the other inhibitors are taken up through the ﬂagellar pocket as T . brucei bloodstream forms have high rates of endocytosis ( Webster and Grifﬁths , 1994 ) . Finally and crucially , CA - 074 , which was not trypanocidal ( Fig . 3 ) , was as effective as CA - 074Me and Z - FA - DMK in completely inhibiting Tb CATB activity as measured with Z - RR - AMC ; there was no signiﬁcant difference in the activities remaining between CA - 074 and CA - 074Me or Z - FA - DMK ( P = 0 . 697 and 0 . 736 ; Table 2 ) . This result demonstrates that , similar to the other inhibitors , CA - 074 readily enters the parasite and quickly inhibits Tb CATB , but fails to affect trypanosome growth ( Fig . 3 ) . Accordingly , it would seem that Tb CATB activity is not essential for the survival of T . brucei . The above chemical evidence suggesting that Tb CATB is not essential for T . brucei survival contrasts starkly with the parasite death obtained following RNAi of Tb CATB ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ) . It is difﬁcult to rationalise the disparate results based on the data available , particularly as only a modest reduction of 32 % of Tb CATB protein was sufﬁcient for RNAi - induced lethality ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ) . We would speculate that ‘RNAi off - targeting , ’ whereby spe - ciﬁc double - stranded ( ds ) RNA directs the RNAi machinery to target transcripts other than that intended , contributed to the previous result . It is known that small inhibitory dsRNAs can cross - react with targets of limited sequence similarity and adversely affect cell viability ( Jackson et al . , 2003 ) . This phenomenon of off - targeting occurs more widely than originally anticipated and can be respon - sible for as many as 30 % of observed toxic phenotypes as has been demonstrated for different cells ( Fedorov et al . , 2006 ) . 3 . 4 . TbCATL is essential but must be completely inhibited for the parasite to die If Tb CATB is not essential for survival , then is Tb CATL ? Using Z - FR - AMC , hydrolytic activity was almost completely inhibited ( > 99 % ) after incubating parasites for 2 h with 100 l M of Z - FA - DMK , CA - 074Me or CAA0225 ( Table 2 ) . The residual hydrolytic activity of 0 . 6 – 0 . 7 % may be due to the above - stated oligopeptidase B which has also been shown to hydrolyse Z - FR - AMC , albeit 6 . 5 - fold less efﬁciently than Z - RR - AMC ( Morty et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , inhibition by CA - 074 was threefold lower and signiﬁcantly differ - ent from the inhibition values obtained for the other inhibitors ( P = 0 . 003 – 0 . 021 ; Table 2 ) . Accordingly , the little Tb CATL activity remaining ( 1 . 8 % ) in the presence of CA - 074 is sufﬁcient to maintain survival of the parasite . This in turn suggests that all of the Tb CATL activity must be inhibited in order to kill T . brucei in vitro . As con - ﬁrmation that Tb CATL rather than Tb CATB is essential for survival , the observed percent inhibitions recorded with CAA0225 is instructive ( Table 2 ) . At the lethal concentration of 100 l M , CATB activity , as measured with Z - RR - AMC , was only partially inhibited ( 71 % ) , whereas CATL activity was almost completely inhibited ( > 99 % ) . The results are signiﬁcant in not only clarifying the essen - tiality of Tb CATL as an essential enzyme but also because they pro - vide a possible explanation as to why the previous RNAi of TbCATL was not lethal to the parasite ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ) . Speciﬁcally , gene suppression was not total and the approximate 35 % of Tb CATL peptidase activity that remained post - RNAi ( Mackey et al . , 2004 ) was more than sufﬁcient to maintain parasite survival . 3 . 5 . CA - 074 and CA - 074Me can inhibit TbCATL but only under reducing conditions Previously , it was reported that CA - 074Me but not CA - 074 inac - tivates CATL within murine ﬁbroblasts ( Montaser et al . , 2002 ) . After co - incubation with T . brucei in vitro we found , likewise , that CA - 074Me inhibits Tb CATL activity ( Table 2 ) . However , the ﬁnding here that CA - 074 also inhibits ( > 98 % ) Tb CATL activity ( Table 2 ) was somewhat surprising given that the inhibitor was originally de - signed to be highly preferential for CATB ( 77 , 000 - fold ; Murata et al . , 1991 ) and was shown in this study not to inhibit the activity of recombinant Tbr CATL ( Table 1 ) . To understand why , we tested the effect of the presence and absence of the reducing agent , DTT , on the inhibition of CP activity in cell extracts . The rationale is that , as for all cells , the intracellular milieu in T . brucei is reducing in nature ( Fairlamb et al . , 1987 ) . Also the intralysosomal milieu has been shown to be a reducing environment ( Pisoni et al . , 1990 ) . In the absence of DTT , pre - incubation of cell extracts with 100 l M of CA - 074 or CA - 074Me inhibited hydrolysis of Table 2 Hydrolysis of ﬂuorogenic substrates benzyloxycarbonyl - arginyl - arginyl - 7 - amido - 4 - methyl coumarin ( Z - RR - AMC ) and benzyloxycarbonyl - phenylalanyl - arginyl - 7 - amido - 4 - methyl coumarin ( Z - FR - AMC ) , by cysteine peptidase ( CP ) activity after co - incubation of Trypanosoma brucei with peptidyl cysteine peptidase inhibitors of differing speciﬁcities . Bloodstream forms of T . brucei clone 427 – 221a were incubated for 2 h with 100 l M inhibitor or DMSO alone , then washed and extracts prepared for assay with the cathepsin B ( CATB ) substrate Z - RR - AMC and the CATB / L substrate , Z - FR - AMC . Absolute values are the mean ± S . D . of three experiments . With Z - RR - AMC , values were also normalised with respect to the inhibition produced by benzyloxycarbonyl - phenylalanyl - arginyl - diazomethyl ketone ( Z - FA - DMK ) , reﬂecting the background oligopeptidase B activity ( Troeberg et al . , 1996 ) . The remaining activity against Z - RR - AMC in cells exposed to ( L - 3 - trans - propylcarbamoyloxirane - 2 - carbonyl ) - L - isoleucyl - L - proline ( CA - 074 ) was not signiﬁcantly different from those following incubation with Z - FA - DMK and the methyl ester version of CA - 074 ( CA - 074Me ) ( P = 0 . 736 and 0 . 697 , respectively ; student’s t test ) . In contrast , the remaining activity against Z - FR - AMC in cells exposed to CA - 074 was signiﬁcantly different from those in cells incubated with Z - FA - DMK , ( ( 2 S , 3 S ) - oxirane - 2 , 3 - dicarboxylic acid 2 - [ ( ( S ) - 1 - benzylcarbamoyl - 2 - phenyl - ethyl ) - amide ] 3 - { [ 2 - ( 4 - hydroxy - phenyl ) - ethyl ] - amide } ) ( CAA0225 ) and CA - 074Me ( P = 0 . 009 , 0 . 021 and 0 . 003 , respectively ; student’s t test ) .

D . Steverding et al . / International Journal for Parasitology 42 ( 2012 ) 481 – 488 485 Z - FR - AMC by 14 % and 19 % , respectively ( Table 3 ) . This is in agree - ment with the previously reported inhibition pattern of these com - pounds for mammalian CATL ( Mutata et al . , 1991 ) . In contrast , in the presence of 1 . 5 mM of DTT , pre - treatment of cell extracts , regardless of the inhibitor used , generated > 98 % inhibition ( Table 3 ) . Thus , the reducing environment provided by DTT and at a con - centration consistent with that found in vivo in T . brucei ( Fairlamb et al . , 1987 ) allows for near total inhibition of Tb CATL activity by CA - 074 and CA - 074Me . Likewise , DTT also increased the potency of all compounds to inhibit hydrolysis of Z - RR - AMC ( Table 3 ) . Interestingly , in the presence of 1 . 5 mM of DTT , CAA0225 efﬁ - ciently inhibited the hydrolysis of Z - RR - AMC of cell extract ( Table 3 ) . This result conﬁrms the inhibition of Z - RR - AMC hydrolysis by CAA0255 observed with living trypanosomes ( Table 2 ) . The requirement for reducing conditions for maximal inhibition of CP activity by CA - 074Me and CA - 074 was highlighted using puriﬁed recombinant Tbr CATL ( Table 4 ) . In the absence of DTT , pre - treatment of the enzyme with 100 l M of the inhibitors had no effect on enzyme activity , whereas in the presence of 1 . 5 mM of DTT inhibition was > 98 % . In contrast , pre - incubation of the en - zyme with 100 l M of CAA0225 or Z - FA - DMK in the absence of DTT resulted in an inhibition of > 80 % ( Table 4 ) . In contrast to Tbr CATL , DTT only slightly increased the effectiveness of all com - pounds to inhibit Tb CATB ( Table 4 ) . Similar effects of DTT to facil - itate inhibition by CA - 074 have been observed for the orthologous CP from Trypanosoma cruzi , cruzain ( Tcr CATL ) and human CATL ( Steverding , 2011 ) . 3 . 6 . Accumulation of lysosomal transferrin is associated with inhibition of TbCATL A hallmark associated with the inhibition of lysosomal CP activ - ity in T . brucei is the accumulation of transferrin in the lysosome ( Grab et al . , 1992 ; Steverding et al . , 1995 ) . To understand whether this accumulation is due to inhibition of Tb CATL or Tb CATB , trypan - osomes were incubated for 2 h with ﬂuorescein - labelled transfer - rin in the presence of 100 l M of inhibitor and subsequently analysed by ﬂow cytometry ( Fig . 4 ) . Trypanosomes incubated with CAA0225 accumulated almost as much transferrin ( 92 % based on the mean ﬂuorescence intensity signal ) as those incubated with Z - FA - DMK ( positive control ) . Cells incubated with CA - 074Me con - centrated somewhat less transferrin ( 68 % ) . In contrast , trypano - somes treated with CA - 074 accumulated only six percentage points more transferrin ( 15 % ) than the negative control cells incu - bated with DMSO ( 9 % ) , suggesting that the almost complete inhi - bition of Tb CATB produced by CA - 074 under these conditions ( Table 2 ) does not interfere with the degradation of transferrin in the lysosome . Thus , only those inhibitors that completely inhibit Tb CATL ( Z - FA - DMK , CAA0225 and CA - 074Me ) and kill the parasite also induce accumulation of transferrin in the lysosome . 3 . 7 . Conclusions We have employed a number of small - molecule inhibitors and substrates for CPs to chemically dissect the relative contributions of Tb CATB and Tb CATL to the survival of the T . brucei parasite . Without contradiction , a number of lines of evidence suggest that the CATL , rather than the CATB , is the essential CP . These include : ( i ) the preferential inhibitors of CATL used in this study ( CAA0225 ) and previously ( Nkemngu et al . , 2003 ) were generally 10 – 100 fold more trypanocidal ( GI 50 values ) than the non - speciﬁc inhibitors ( Z - FA - DMK and CA - 074Me ) ; ( ii ) the CATB - speciﬁc inhibitor , CA - 074 , although shown to enter the parasite and completely inhibit Tb CATB was , nevertheless , without effect on parasite growth and survival ; ( iii ) the lack of parasite kill by CA - 074 was associated with the incomplete inhibition of Tb CATL ( an inhibition facilitated Table 3 Effect of DTT on inhibition of cysteine peptidase activity in cell extracts of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms by epoxysuccinyl peptide inhibitors and benzyloxycarbonyl - phenylalanyl - arginyl - diazomethyl ketone ( Z - FA - DMK ) .

Finally , with all but the CATB - speciﬁc inhibitor , CA - 074 , parasite death was preceded by a signiﬁcant accumulation of ﬂuorescent transferrin in the lysosome . Our suggestion that Tb CATL rather than Tb CATB is essential for survival of T . brucei is supported by a previous observation that a purine - derived nitrile ( compound 3 { 12 , 2 } ) inhibits human CATL and kills trypanosomes at a very low concentration ( Mallari et al . , 2008b ) . Although the present data support Tb CATL as an essential CP and drug target , considerable effort remains to optimise a struc - ture – activity - relationship ( SAR ) for inhibitors of Tb CATL as a cen - tral component of a pre - clinical drug development programme . Fortunately , crystal structures are already available for Tbr CATL ( Kerr et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) with which a rational design approach can be facilitated . Also , the wealth of experience already gained from a long - standing programme to optimise inhibitors of the orthologous T . cruzi enzyme , Tcr CATL ( cruzain ; e . g . , Kerr et al . , 2009 ; Chen et al . , 2010 ) will prove valuable . Yet , any such SAR process involving Tb CATL should maintain a perspective that balances sufﬁcient on - target speciﬁcity with try - panocidal potency . It is pertinent to consider that even commercial ‘off - the - shelf’ CP inhibitors , selective for neither Tb CATB nor Tb CATL , are effective trypanocides in vitro ( with excellent selectiv - ity indices versus mammalian cells ; Scory et al . , 1999 ; Caffrey et al . , 2000 ; Nkemngu et al . , 2003 ) and signiﬁcantly decrease parasitemia in animal models of acute disease ( Scory et al . , 1999 ; Caffrey et al . , 2000 ) . Presumably , these encouraging data arise in part from the parasite’s ability to rapidly endocytose exogenous compounds ( Webster and Grifﬁths , 1994 ) and the lack of functional redundancy among T . brucei CPs ( both qualitative and quantitative ) compared with the mammalian host ( Caffrey et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , with these favourable parasitological factors in play , the typical and often protracted SAR goal to iteratively derive greater speciﬁcity for the target may not be entirely necessary . Rather , equal effort might focus on an earlier and better under - standing of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sufﬁ - ciently potent , even if not entirely selective , CP inhibitors , especially with regard to those factors enabling penetration of the blood – brain - barrier and treatment of CNS - inﬁltrated HAT .
