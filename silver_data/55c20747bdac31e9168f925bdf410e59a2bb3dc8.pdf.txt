Compound 35 consisting of a Leu residue fitting into the S2 pocket and a triarylic moiety consisting of thiophene , a 1 , 2 , 4 - oxadiazole and a phenyl ring fitting into the S3 pocket , and compound 33 with a 3 - bromo - Phe residue ( S2 ) and a biphenyl fragment ( S3 ) were found to inhibit rhodesain in the single - digit nanomolar range . The observed steep structure - activity relationship could be explained by covalent docking simulations . With their high selectivity indices ( ca . 200 ) and the good antitrypanosomal activity ( 8 µM ) the compounds represent promising starting points for new rhodesain inhibitors . Keywords : Dipeptide nitrile Cysteine protease Rhodesain Inhibitor Trypanosoma The cysteine protease rhodesain of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei which causes the human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT , African sleeping sickness ) is considered a target for new antitrypanosomal drugs due to its role in the parasite’s iron homeostasis 1 and the parasite’s ability to cross the blood - brain barrier . 2 Peptidic nitriles have widely been evaluated as inhibitors of cysteine cathepsins , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 which are the human analogs of rhodesain , and non - peptidic nitriles have been shown to be excellent inhibitors of rhodesain and cathepsins . 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 In the latter case , the selectivity was successively optimized based on X - ray crystallographic studies of enzyme - inhibitor complexes and docking studies . 11 The nitrile group has been shown to function as an electrophilic warhead which undergoes a reversible addition reaction with the nucleophilic Cys residue of the cysteine protease yielding a thioimidate . 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 In the present study , we evaluated the potency and selectivity of a series of known dipeptide nitrile - based cysteine cathepsin inhibitors ( Table 1 ) as new inhibitors of rhodesain in order to gain insights into the structure - activity and structure - selectivity relationships . A special focus was put onto the substituents binding into the S2 ( Xaa in Figure 1 ) and S3 ( CG in Figure 1 ) pockets since previous studies on rhodesain and cathepsin L showed that variations of the substituents for the S1 pocket had only weak effects on affinity and selectivity . 11 The most active compounds were also analyzed for their antitrypanosomal activity ( Table 3 ) by applying a previously described method . 17 The synthesis of compounds derived from the general structure shown in Figure 1 has already been published . 3 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 Figure 1 .

Rhodesain inhibition was tested with the fluorogenic substrate Cbz - Phe - Arg - AMC ( [ S ] = 10 µM ) as described previously . 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 First , a screening at 20 µM inhibitor concentration was performed . For compounds showing > 50 % inhibition , the IC 50 values were determined as mean values ( difference < 10 % in all cases ) from two independent assays . The progress curves showed time - independent inhibition ( see Figure 2a ) . For selected compounds , namely 14 ( data not shown ) , 33 and 35 , the IC 50 values were determined at different substrate concentrations in order to check for competitive or non - competitive inhibition . IC 50 values were found to increase linearly with increasing substrate concentrations indicating competitive inhibition as expected and as also known for inhibition of cysteine cathepsins by peptide nitriles 25 ( see Figure 2b for compounds 33 and 35 ) . By applying this method , K i values of 2 . 6 nM and 5 . 3 nM were determined for 33 and 35 , respectively . Since the selected compounds were found to be competitive with respect to the substrate , this kinetic behavior was also expected for all peptide nitriles of this study and the K i values towards rhodesain for all other compounds ( Table 1 ) were calculated from the IC 50 values using the Cheng - Prusoff equation . 26 a ) b ) Figure 2 . a ) The progress curves for inhibition of rhodesain by compound 35 ( inhibitor concentrations from top to bottom : 0 – 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 – 5 . 0 – 10 . 0 – 20 . 0 µM ; substrate concentration [ S ] = 10 µM ) show time - independent inhibition . b ) Dependence of inhibition potency ( IC 50 values ) from substrate concentration . Increasing IC 50 values at ascending substrate concentrations prove competitive inhibition ; the K i value ( corresponding to the IC 50 value at zero substrate concentration ) was obtained as the intercept of the regression line with the y - axis ( K i = 0 . 0026 µM ( 33 ) ; K i = 0 . 0053 µM ( 35 ) ) . In general , the compounds displayed similar selectivity profiles , i . e . they were stronger inhibitors of mammalian cathepsin L and the TbCatL rhodesain ( T . brucei cathepsin L - like protease ) compared to cathepsin B . Compounds which were not or only weakly active against the mammalian cysteine cathepsins ( 1 , 2 , 10 , 19 - 21 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 40 - 42 , 45 - 48 ) did also not inhibit the related parasite protease rhodesain . In accordance with previous findings , 11 rhodesain preferred extended hydrophobic residues for its S2 pocket with the 3 - and 4 - Br - Phe residues ( compounds 14 , 15 , 16 , 33 ) and the corresponding fluoro derivatives ( compounds 24 , 25 , 26 ) as particular active ones among the subseries of Boc derivatives ( 3 - 27 ) . However , general halophilic properties of rhodesain’s S2 specificity pocket could not be concluded from these data as the corresponding Phe and Tyr derivatives 3 and 4 were similarly potent . Obviously , neither small hydrophobic residues ( Gly ( 28 ) , Ala ( 10 ) , Pro ( 12 ) , Aba ( 19 ) , cyclopropyl - Ala ( 21 ) ) nor those of homocycloleucine ( 32 , 36 , 37 ) or the polar , sulfone - based residues ( 40 - 48 ) did fit properly into the S2 pocket of rhodesain . This observation was made irrespectively of the nature of the capping group ( CG ) . Interestingly , the homocycloleucine residue seemed to be less favorable than the open - chain and more flexible Leu counterpart ( 36 versus 35 ) . Among the aliphatic or alicyclic residues , only Leu ( 34 , 35 ) and Cha ( 6 ) were well accepted as S2 substituents . Exchange of Phe against aza - Phe ( 3 versus 20 ) , i . e . replacing the  - carbon atom by nitrogen , led to a complete loss of activity against rhodesain and , as already been reported , 19 against cathepsin L . Also in accordance with a previous study , 11 the structure - activity relationship on the S3 pocket showed a clear preference for aromatic substituents with the biaryl derivative 33 as the most active inhibitor displaying a dissociation constant in the single - digit nanomolar range ( 2 . 6 nM , see Figure 2b ) . This compound , together with inhibitor 35 ( K i = 5 . 3 nM , see Figure 2b ) , was the most selective one as well , with a selectivity index of ca . 200 versus cathepsin L . Interestingly , changing the triarylic substituent , consisting of thiophene , 1 , 2 , 4 - oxadiazole and benzene , from an amide ( 35 ) to an urea ( 34 ) linkage , led to a dramatic loss in affinity , both in case of inhibition of rhodesain and , reportedly , 21 of mammalian cathepsin L . The main determinant for high affinity seemed to be the S2 substituent . Hence , the weak affinity caused by polar S2 substituents ( compounds 40 - 48 ) can hardly be compensated by highly affine biarylic S3 groups . Since the structure - activity relationship for compounds 34 , 35 and 36 were found to be remarkably steep , a covalent docking simulation with DOCKTITE 27 was performed in order to provide an explanation for this structural sensitivity to minor structural changes . Compound 35 indeed showed higher scores compared to its analogues ( Table 2 ) . The inhibitor binds with its Leu side chain into the S2 pocket and its aryl substituents into the S3 pocket ( Figure 3 ) . The thioimidate resulting from the covalent reaction with the active site Cys residue points towards His162 . The two heterocycles form π – π stacking interactions to Phe61 . In case of compound 36 , the central P2 - P1 - connecting amide bond is not well oriented which results in lack of hydrogen bonding to Gly66 . Additionally , the homocycloleucine side chain does not fully extend into the S2 pocket which leads to a loss of the very important hydrophobic interactions within the S2 pocket . The main reason for the lower affinity of compound 34 also seems to be the central amide bond which is not properly placed . Therefore , compound 34 forms no hydrogen bonds to Gly66 and Asp161 .

The standard DOCKTITE protocol was followed as described . 27 The pharmacophore docking step was performed without a pharmacophore restriction of the nucleophilic sulfur of Cys25 to cover a larger conformational space . Additionally , an AtomQ feature was generated using MOE site finder to define the properties of the binding pocket . The initial docking solutions were rescored with the MOE implemented scoring functions Affinity dG and London dG and the external knowledge based DSX scoring function . 30 The docking solution with highest DSX score was selected for each compound and visualized with PyMol 1 . 3 ( Figures 3 ) . 31 a ) b ) c ) d ) Figure 3 . a ) Proposed binding mode of compound 35 as obtained by covalent docking with DOCKTITE . 27 Hydrogen bonds are found to Gly66 and Asp161 .

This activity correlated with the enzyme inhibition making the nanomolar inhibitor 35 the best antitrypanosomal agent . However , the compounds did not reach the high antitrypanosomal activity of other nitrile - based rhodesain inhibitors . 11 A main reason might be the lack of basic substituents since previous studies showed that an increase in antitrypanosomal activity can be achieved by the introduction of basic side chains . 11 With compounds 33 and 35 , this study revealed highly active ( single - digit nanomolar affinity ) and selective ( selectivity indices ca . 200 ) rhodesain inhibitors which represent good starting points to be structurally optimized in terms of antitrypanosomal activity .

This enzyme transforms D - luciferine into D - luciferine adenylate in the presence of ATP and Mg . Luciferine adenylate then turns into the excited keto form of oxyluciferin . ATP can therefore be used as a marker for cell viability . All experiments were performed in white 96 - well microplates ( PerkinElmer ) . Each well was filled with 90 μL of medium containing 2500 cells / mL T . brucei brucei BS449 cells . Each tested compound was then diluted in HMI - 9 medium stepwise 1 : 3 in 10 steps on a separate microplate and 10 μL of each respective dilution was added to the corresponding wells on a white microplate . In addition to that , 10 % DMSO was used as a positive control and the highest concentration of DMSO added with the compounds ( 0 . 3 % DMSO , since higher concentrations of DMSO had negative impacts on trypanosomal cell growth ) was used as a negative control . Each compound was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h , 48 h and 72 h in separate triplicates before analyzing with the Victor X4 plate reader ( PerkinElmer ) at room temperature . Prior to analyzing , 50 μL of ATPlite 1 step solution was added to each well of the microplate , providing luciferin and luciferase as well as initiating cell lysis . A dose - response curve was obtained by plotting the measured values against the logarithmic compound concentrations and the EC 50 value was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 . Chlorhexidine , a well - known inhibitor of trypanothione reductase , was used as positive control . 34 Crouch , S . P . M . ; Kozlowski , R . ; Slater , K . J . ; Fletcher , J . J . Immunol .
