From this design space , we select a subset of fourteen 2 - D menus , for which we collect users’ preferences during a vignette experiment with N = 251 participants . We report numerical measures of absolute , relative , and aggregate preference for smartglasses menus , and employ a particular Thurstone’s pair - wise comparison technique , the Bradley - Terry model , to evaluate menu designs . Our results highlight key variables influencing users’ preferences regarding the visual appearance of smartglasses menus , which we use to discuss opportunities for future work .

Smartglasses designs range from Head - Mounted Displays ( HMD ) that render photorealistic computer - generated graphics in the form of holo - graphic computing [ 47 , 52 ] to fashionable tech eyewear , such as Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page .

Applications for smartglasses address a variety of user needs , from the simple feature of redirecting smartphone notifications [ 81 ] to showing maps and street views to aid with navigation [ 50 ] , video games [ 69 ] , lifelogging [ 3 , 4 ] , and assistive technology for people with visual [ 2 , 60 , 89 ] and motor impairments [ 29 , 36 , 49 ] . Just like any other interactive device , smartglasses need some form of input to enable users to react to notifications and to se - lect their preferred choice among the options presented by the user interface . Organizing those options in menus remains one of the most common approach to structure input and to interact effectively with computing systems and devices [ 11 , 44 ] , including wearables , and smartglasses are no exception . However , menu de - sign for smartglasses comes with specific challenges , e . g . , limited screen real estate to display the menu items and potential occlusion and interference with the user’s field of view . Unfortunately , design knowledge to handle such constraints properly is missing and the reasonable option for practitioners is to resort to generic menu designs [ 10 , 11 , 44 ] , which may not always comply with the specific characteristics , form factors , and contexts of use for smartglasses . For example , should menu items be presented on smartglasses horizontally or rather vertically ? If horizontally , should menus be displayed at the top , bottom , or in the middle of the see - through lenses and , consequently , in the middle of the central visual field ? Are 1 - D linear menus preferable to 2 - D circular menus in terms of visual appearance ? These are just a few examples of possible design options for which little is known about users’ preferences . In this paper , we address these aspects with a design space for smartglasses graphical menus and a vignette experiment [ 7 , 30 , 38 ] that we conducted to collect , quantify , and analyze users’ prefer - ences regarding the visual appearance of smartglasses menus . Our contributions are as follows : ( 1 ) We outline a space of visual design options for graphical menus for smartglasses informed by the literature on graph - ical menus and guided , among others , by Bertin’s visual variables [ 15 ] and work from visual aesthetics [ 37 , 88 ] . ( 2 ) We conduct a vignette experiment [ 7 , 30 ] with N = 251 par - ticipants by implementing a randomized A / B testing proce - dure [ 72 ] to quantify preferences regarding the visual ap - pearance of smartglasses menus . To this end , we introduce and employ six measures of absolute , relative , and aggregate preference based on dismissal , preference , and ties rates , the Bradley - Terry model [ 19 ] for evaluating design alternatives , and Kendall’s coefficient of concordance among raters [ 40 ] . 1 MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany Radu - Daniel Vatavu and Jean Vanderdonckt 2 RELATED WORK We discuss in this section prior work on designing interaction tech - niques for smartglasses and we briefly overview the vast literature on graphical menus with a focus on visual aesthetics . 2 . 1 Interaction Techniques for Smartglasses Interaction techniques for smartglasses generally fall into one of three broad categories : handheld , touch - based either on the device or on the body , and touchless by means of mid - air gesture input and voice commands ; see Lee and Hui [ 45 ] for a survey and discussion . The question of how to effectively design smartglasses graphical menus remains open since current interaction techniques for menu item selection , such as from [ 45 ] , have been introduced on the assumption that menu design has already been achieved . Touch input , in the form of taps and swipe gestures performed on the touchpads embedded in smartglasses can be used for item selection and for scrolling menu items . For example , LYRA [ 8 ] , a Google Glass application designed to assist flight attendants by displaying situated information regarding requests made by pas - sengers , is controlled with taps and swipes : a tap on the touchpad marks a passenger request as completed , while swipes to the left and right show more information about the passenger . The au - thors’ goal with their design was to keep “navigation through the application simplistic to allow discrete and easy control” ( p . 213 ) but essentially this meant falling back on existing design knowledge for interacting with touchscreens and touchpads , repurposed for input on smartglasses . Touch input was also considered by Islam et al . [ 39 ] , who proposed ten tap gestures for an authentication sys - tem for smartglasses . Their input method was informed by tapping techniques previously developed for smartwatches , i . e . , “tapping gestures have also been previously explored on wearables . . . This con - cept and the timing threshold influenced the design of the tapping gesture set proposed in this paper” [ 39 , p . 16 : 4 ] . Other examples of adaptations of existing techniques to work on smartglasses can be found in the literature ; e . g . , SwipeZone [ 35 ] is a text entry tech - nique for smartglasses that uses gesture input to select letters from a 3 × 3 rectangular menu , which draws inspiration from input on ultra - small touchscreens [ 23 ] ; the WISEGlass system [ 82 ] leveraged context awareness and implemented input multimodality for con - textual menus ; and Dingler et al . [ 25 ] were interested in gesture commands for Rapid Serial Visual Presentation ( RSVP ) controls to be consistently used across smartphones , smartwatches , and smart - glasses . Such examples show how , in the absence of explicit design knowledge on smartglasses graphical menus , the community has resorted to adapting existing designs and interaction techniques to accommodate the form factors and specific characteristics of smartglasses . While successful in some situations , this approach may not work in others , such as touch input on smartglasses for users with upper - body motor impairments [ 48 , 49 ] . 2 . 2 Design Principles for Graphical Menus A large literature is available on designing graphical menus and corresponding interaction techniques ; see [ 11 ] for a review and discussion . Graphical menus can be linear , rectangular , circular , horizontal , vertical , static , dynamic , contextual , adaptive and can feature many modalities to present items or to enable users to select those items . For example , contextual menus display options that depend on the current task or context of use , limiting the number of items presented to users to those relevant for the task at hand ; e . g . , after selecting a home appliance , a contextual menu is displayed to show actions available to control that appliance [ 42 ] . Non - contextual menus are independent of the underlying context and , therefore , can be displayed according to generic , scene - independent criteria . How to display graphical menus on smartglasses , however , intro - duces new challenges represented by the limited screen real estate , potential occlusion with the visual scene and , in some cases , lim - ited input capabilities of the device itself [ 45 ] . Some smartglasses models have relaxed these constraints , e . g . , the Epson Moverio BT - 350 features a large optical display and Microsoft HoloLens [ 52 ] complements 2 - D user interface controls , e . g . , windows and menus , with photorealistic 3 - D graphics aligned with the real world . The extensive body of work on menu design for immerse vir - tual environments ( VR ) could potentially be exploited to inform design for AR smartglasses , including user interfaces and menus , but further validation experiments are necessary . For example , Mul - der [ 53 ] compared five techniques for selecting items from a 2 - D menu projected in a 3 - D virtual environment : ray casting , sight - based and orthogonal projective techniques , 3 - D positioning , and mouse - based selection . Their results showed that mouse - based selection was the fastest technique , followed by orthogonal , sight - based , ray casting , and 3 - D positioning ; however , for a large number of menu items , ray casting was recommended [ 53 ] , which implies that additional equipment must be available to track users’ hand movements and pointing gestures . Although wearing additional equipment might not be a major issue in VR , such as for the “Tulip” menu [ 18 ] , it may prove cumbersome for mobile scenarios . 2 . 3 Vignette Studies to Collect Perceptions of and Responses to Hypothetical Situations In this work , we conduct a vignette study [ 30 ] in order to collect and examine the perceptions of potential users regarding a variety of graphical menu designs for smartglasses . In the rest of this section , we present what a vignette study is since such studies have been little employed in the HCI research and practice [ 34 , 38 , 46 ] , and we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these type of studies . A “vignette” is a description of a hypothetical situation , such as Souza’s [ 24 ] illustration of the risky decision taken by a naive user to store sensitive information in the internal storage of the web browser running on their computer . Finch [ 30 ] described vi - gnettes as “short stories about hypothetical characters in specified circumstances , to whose situation the interviewee is invited to re - spond” ( p . 105 ) . More generally , a vignette is “a short , carefully constructed description of a person , object , or situation , representing a systematic combination of characteristics” [ 7 , p . 128 ] . In the case of smartglasses menus , a vignette represents any textual or graphical depiction suggesting a hypothetical arrangement and display of menu items . However , even though the vignette is a fiction , it nev - ertheless illustrates a potential real - world situation or scenario and , consequently , vignettes operate in the realm of possibilities for the phenomena and actions they describe . Thus , an important charac - teristic of vignettes is that they empower interviewees and study participants “to define the situation [ depicted by the vignette ] in their 2 Design Space and Users’ Preferences for Smartglasses Graphical Menus : A Vignette Study MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany own terms” [ 14 ] . Finch [ 30 ] noted the distinctiveness of the vignette method with respect to other survey techniques : “vignettes do make possible one particular form of open - ended question which is situa - tionally specific” ( p . 106 ) . According to this perspective , vignettes approach projective techniques from psychology that enable study participants to define the meaning of the situation for themselves . This characteristic of vignettes comes very handy during interviews since it limits the influence of the interviewer on inflicting their perspective onto the interviewee . When a vignette is employed as part of an experiment , such as applying vignettes in psychology or sociology [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 30 , 84 ] where participants are introduced to the situation pictured by the vignette and their impressions and perceptions of that situation are collected , the experiment is called a “vignette study” [ 1 , 7 , 9 , 28 , 59 , 65 ] . In such studies , the descriptions delivered by vignettes represent the support for the study participants to form their understanding of the hypothetical situation under investigation and to respond to that situation . Atzmüller and Steiner [ 7 ] pointed to the strengths and weaknesses of vignette studies compared to other methods . For example , while traditional surveys have high external validity , they also exhibit low internal validity caused by the multicollinearity of the measured variables ; and traditional experiment designs have high internal validity , but may exhibit low external validity because of the samples of participants not being representative of the target population [ 7 ] . In this context , vignette studies address the limita - tions of both surveys and experiments [ 7 , 65 ] : according to Aguinis and Bradley [ 1 ] , the vignette method represents ”a way to address the dilemma of conducting experimental research that results in high levels of confidence regarding internal validity but is challenged by threats to external validity versus conducting nonexperimental re - search that usually maximizes external validity but whose conclusions are ambiguous regarding causal relationships " ( p . 351 ) . The use of vignette studies has been scarce in the HCI commu - nity , where we were able to identify just a handful of papers . For example , Lindgaard et al . [ 46 ] used vignettes to present participants with fictitious cover stories about patient symptoms in their study to inform the design of diagnostic decision support systems ; Ellis and Tyre [ 26 ] conducted a vignette study to examine help - seeking and help - giving by technology users and technical specialists ; and Goodman et al . [ 34 ] used vignettes to illustrate everyday interaction design work to demonstrate how professionals negotiate research questions relevant to interaction design . More recently , Hoyle et al . [ 38 ] reported results from an online factorial vignette study con - ducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk with N = 279 participants to collect judgments regarding the appropriateness of posting private photographs online . Our choice for a vignette experiment to conduct our scientific investigation vs . other types of research methods will be thoroughly motivated in Section 4 . For now , we simply note the flexibility of the vignette method for interviewers and interviewees alike as well as the opportunity to administer it over the web , e . g . , by delivering it as part of a web - based tool [ 72 ] , in order to reach a large audience of participants ( N = 251 in our experiment ) , difficult to reach otherwise in laboratory studies . We also note the opportunity of web - based vignette experiments to enable HCI researchers to collect responses from participants with reduced mobility , such as people with motor impairments , or people under the constraints of social distancing .

To this end , we build on a rich literature on designing visual menus [ 10 , 11 , 54 , 62 ] , from which we draw inspiration with respect to input modalities [ 10 , 11 ] , input information [ 54 ] , menu item geometry and scrolling [ 10 ] , menu geometry , and menu position [ 62 ] . Also , since we focus on visual menus , we adopt Bertin’s [ 15 ] visual variables as guidance to structure the dimensions of our design space by considering position , orientation , size , shape , value , color , texture , and motion options . We equally draw from the work of Hashimoto [ 37 ] on the fundamentals of visual design and from Zen and Vanderdon - ckt [ 88 ] on the aesthetics of graphical UIs . For example , according to Hashimoto [ 37 ] , visual design applied to graphical UIs aims to optimize the usage of visual elements to ensure aesthetics toward a rich user experience . Thus , visual aesthetics can be assessed by evaluating visual properties , such as balance , symmetry , equilib - rium , and proportion as part of the multi - factorial aspect of visual design [ 88 ] . Lastly , we follow the principles of “connecting design characteristics with design goals” of Samp [ 61 ] , which we adapt to smartglasses graphical menus . For example , we use the visual structure principle to inform the item presentation dimension in our design space and the item shape categories to inform various shapes for smartglasses graphical menus . Based on the above considerations , our design space consists of eight dimensions : ( 1 ) menu location , ( 2 ) shape , ( 3 ) orientation , ( 4 ) dimensionality , ( 5 ) item presentation , ( 6 ) item count , ( 7 ) selection indicator , and ( 8 ) item scrolling ; see Figure 1 . For example , the loca - tion of the menu can be at the top , bottom , in the middle , on the left or right side of the lenses ; menu items can be displayed horizontally , vertically , diagonally , circularly , or at a custom angle ; the shape of the menu can be linear , rectangular , etc . Our design space distills established concepts from the literature on menu design and visual aesthetics into the first adaptation for smartglasses . 3 MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany Radu - Daniel Vatavu and Jean Vanderdonckt Analytical Methods Empirical methods , questionnaires , preference elicitation Design tests , alternative designs , iterative evaluation , code static analysis Critical incidents , interaction recorder , dynamic analysis Represented Real R e p r e s e n t e d R e a l User U s e r i n t e r f a c e What people do How many and how much ?

[ 83 ] ( left ) and Rohrer [ 58 ] ( right ) . 4 EXPERIMENT We conducted a vignette study [ 7 , 30 , 38 ] to collect prospective users’ preferences regarding the visual appearance of smartglasses menus . In our study , a vignette consists of a graphical mock - up of a smart - glasses menu derived by manipulating one or multiple dimensions of our design space , e . g . , location and item presentation . Two such vignettes are presented simultaneously to participants to generate a contrasting effect . To control the presentation of multiple pairs , we employed the A / B testing method [ 41 ] due to its popularity in many areas of research [ 12 , 41 , 87 ] . According to this method , participants are elicited for their preferences regarding several alternatives . We used the AB4Web software tool [ 72 ] to implement the A / B testing method . Before proceeding further with the description of our ex - periment design , we briefly present the scope of our vignette study since such studies have been little employed in HCI . 4 . 1 The Scope of Our Experiment Since we collect the preferences of prospective ( not actual ) users regarding mock - up ( not actual ) designs of smartglasses menus , it is important to clarify the contextual framework in which our experiment is conducted next to its specific nature of a vignette study [ 7 , 13 , 30 ] . To this end , Figure 2 illustrates the scope of our experiment in terms of two frameworks proposed by Whitefield et al . [ 83 ] and Rohrer [ 58 ] , respectively . The dimensions of Whitefield et al . [ 83 ] instantiate both real artifacts and representations of the user and the UI . In our experi - ment , we target prospected users , for which little to no experience in wearing and using smartglasses is expected , in order to reach a sample of participants as large and diverse as possible . Similarly , smartglasses menus are represented in our experiment by means of graphical abstractions ( the vignettes ) in order not to influence participants with the particular look and feel induced by a specific operating system , model of smartglasses , or application . The top - right quadrant of Figure 2 , left reflects the positioning desired for our experiment in terms of the framework from [ 83 ] . The two dimensions from Rohrer [ 58 ] contrast the qualitative vs . the quantitative ( on the horizontal axis ) and the attitudinal vs . the behavioral components ( on the vertical axis ) for empirical research studies . The first contrast establishes whether the research method produces data about participants by means of direct observation as opposed to using indirect observations . The second contrast makes the distinction between perceived attitudes and participants’ actual behavior . We believe that capturing participants’ behavior indirectly on various smartglasses designs may lead to inconsis - tencies due to the various form factors of those devices and their heterogeneous interaction capabilities . Consequently , we designed our experiment to collect data directly in terms of preferences for the visual appearance of menus depicted using vignettes in ways that are independent of any smartglasses model , operating sys - tem , or application , which positions our experiment design in the bottom - left part of Rohrer’s [ 58 ] framework ; see Figure 2 , right . 4 . 2 Participants A number of 290 volunteers responded to our invitation to partici - pate in an online questionnaire implemented using AB4Web [ 72 ] . Participants’ demographics covered a broad range of nationalities from seventeen countries ( in alphabetical order : Algeria , Austria , Belgium , Brazil , Columbia , France , Germany , Greece , Japan , Lux - embourg , Portugal , Romania , Spain , The Netherlands , Tunisia , UK , USA ) , spoken languages , and professional domains ( e . g . , admin - istration , business , education , finance , government , health care , information technology , law , management , software development , and students of various fields of study ) . We discarded the responses of 39 participants ( 13 . 7 % ) because of incomplete data or uncommit - ted responses , such as participants repeatedly entering the same answer ( e . g . , always picking the left or the right variant for all or most of the comparisons ) or too rapid responses . In the end , the number of effective participants with valid data considered for our analysis was N = 251 . Participants’ ages ranged between 10 and 81 years old ( M = 31 . 1 , SD = 12 . 4 years ) and 30 . 7 % were female . 4 . 3 Stimuli and Apparatus Because of the wide range of possible combinations of the options from our design space ( Figure 1 ) , we adopted two guiding principles 4 Design Space and Users’ Preferences for Smartglasses Graphical Menus : A Vignette Study MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany Figure 3 : The fourteen vignettes employed in our experiment . Notes : each menu is encoded using the notation LOM , where L stands for location ( T for top , B for bottom , S for side , M for middle ) , O for orientation ( H horizontal , V vertical , C circular , R rectangular ) , and M for the modality of presentation ( Uni for unimodal icons and Bi for bimodal text and icons ) . to reduce the number of distinct menu designs for our vignette experiment so that the experiment would be ( i ) practical in terms of the workload expected from participants to complete the study and ( ii ) to cover as many design options as possible without affecting the representation quality of the smartglasses menu vignettes . Our two guiding principles address the suitability of graphical menus represented using vignettes and directing participants’ attention toward the menu design as a whole : ( 1 ) Smartglasses menus should be effectively presented in the form of 2 - D graphical vignettes without any loss in repre - sentation quality because of dimensionality reduction or conversion of non - graphical modalities to graphical output . For example , 2 . 5 - D and 3 - D menus are less straightforward to represent on a 2 - D display compared to 1 - D / 2 - D designs and , thus , we eliminated dimensionality from our experiment . ( 2 ) The vignette should not draw participants’ attention toward specific menu items , but rather focus it on the visual appear - ance of the menu design as a whole . Furthermore , depicting individual menu items in specific states ( e . g . , selected , dis - abled , etc . ) would have considerably increased the number of vignettes to be presented to our participants . Therefore , we decided to eliminate the selection indicator and item scrolling design dimensions from our experiment . Future work can address users’ perceptions regarding item - specific visual appearance , such as evaluating various types of selection indicators to indicate item scrolling options . By following these two guiding principles , we were left with the location , orientation , shape , item count , and item presentation dimensions . To eliminate the potential effect of the number of menu items on participants’ perceptions of visual appearance , we decided that each vignette should present the same number of menu items . In the end , we selected a number of 14 representative menu types defined by the following four dimensions : location ( with the options : top , bottom , middle , and side ) , orientation ( horizontal and vertical ) , shape ( linear and rectangular ) , and item presentation ( unimodal icons and bimodal text and icons ) . We created mock - ups of each of the 14 smartglasses menu types with six menu items : four generic items ( “Send email” , “Open browser” , “Connect glasses to platform” , and “Show list of contacts” ) and two navigation items ( “Previous” and “Next” ) . For each menu design , a vectorial image was produced ( see Figure 3 ) for the AB4Web application [ 72 ] . 4 . 4 Task Participants were presented with pairs of vignettes depicting menu design alternatives and were asked to select the variants they pre - ferred most by relying exclusively on the visual appearance of the presented information . In case participants were undecided , AB4Web [ 72 ] offered a “draw” option . By following the open end - edness of vignette studies that expect respondents to define the situation depicted by the vignettes by themselves [ 14 , 30 ] , we did not provide any specific guidance to our participants regarding how visual appearance should be evaluated nor any context informa - tion ( i . e . , there was no illustration of any background perceivable through the glasses or any suggestion of an application domain ) . By adopting this minimalistic representation for menus and by not anchoring our participants’ preferences in any set of visual aesthet - ics criteria or specific context of use for smartglasses , we aimed for eliciting a wide range of preferences resulted from self - formed impressions of what visual appearances would work best for menus shown in the context of a pair of glasses . In other types of studies conducted to elicit users’ preferences , such as end - user gesture elicitation [ 73 , 79 , 86 ] , similar minimalistic approaches are adopted by removing unnecessary details , such as details of graphical UIs pertaining to some specific operating system that might influence participants’ responses . In some instances of applying the end - user elicitation method [ 33 ] or in the case of standard forms of question - naires and surveys that elicit users’ preferences [ 56 ] , participants are simply asked to imagine the effect based on a textual description of the situation under examination . In our case , the use of vignettes assures representations of graphical menus independent of any smartglasses model , operating system , or application . Note that this approach works well when the expected participation is large 5 MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany Radu - Daniel Vatavu and Jean Vanderdonckt ( the goal of our study ) in order to understand consensus formation from many responses and might not work as well for in - the - lab stud - ies with few participants , for which controlled conditions are either explicit ( e . g . , participants are presented with an actual graphical representation of a menu ) or implicit ( e . g . , there is an actual pair of smartglasses of a given brand and model ) . Also , we followed recom - mendations for implementing vignette studies , e . g . , the presented stories should not be too complex , should contain sufficient context for participants to form an understanding about the depicted situa - tion but also be vague enough to force them to contribute factors that influence their decisions , and stories must appear plausible , real , and reflect mundane occurrences [ 14 ] . These recommenda - tions are reflected in the context - independent , device - independent , application - independent , and operating system - independent graph - ical representations of the menus illustrated in Figure 3 . A simulation revealed that about 30 minutes were needed to complete all the 14 · ( 14 − 1 ) / 2 = 91 trials , which we considered a duration too long for volunteers of an online questionnaire with potential negative influence on the completion rate of the experi - ment and the quality of the results because of fatigue or boredom effects . Therefore , a restricted number of 30 pairs of vignettes were randomly generated for each participant making sure that , overall , the numbers of presentations of each menu type , across all the participants of the study , were roughly equal . The order of pairs was randomized across participants and the order of presenting the menus in each pair ( left vs . right ) was randomized across pairs . No time constraint was imposed . With this procedure , participants needed between 5 and 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire . 4 . 5 Measures Computing consensus among users can be accomplished in sev - eral ways , such as by employing Condorcet , Borda , or Dowdall counts [ 27 ] , Kendall’s coefficient of concordance [ 40 ] , Bradley - Terry’s estimates of abilities [ 19 ] , or agreement and coagreement measures from end - user elicitation studies [ 77 , 78 , 86 ] . For example , the Borda count is a consensus - based voting system that determines the outcome of a debate by assigning to each candidate a number of points corresponding to the number of candidates that were ranked lower . Another popular method was introduced by Bradley and Terry [ 19 ] , who proposed a model for estimating the probability of preference for a specific element among many options . The Bradley - Terry model has been adopted in the practice of HCI , such as by Serrano et al . [ 63 ] to analyze user preferences for visual designs of rectangular displays ; Al Maimani and Roudaut [ 5 ] employed it to examine users’ preferences for haptic feedback ; Takao et al . [ 68 ] used the model to understand the effects of differences in timing between motion and utterance ; and Chen et al . [ 22 ] evaluated the Quality of Experience of multimedia content using crowdsourcing . Several measures of agreement [ 6 , 74 , 77 , 78 , 86 ] have been popular - ized in the context of gesture elicitation studies [ 80 , 85 , 86 ] to inform , among other , the selection of “winning” gestures representative of users’ preferences for specific devices or specific contexts of use . Informed by this large literature on computing consensus , we decided to employ multiple measures instead of just one ; see next . But first , we introduce two concepts : ( 1 ) Num - Presentations represents the number of times that a particular menu was presented to participants as part of the A / B - type comparisons . For example , if the BHBi design was randomly selected to be presented in seven distinct A / B - type comparisons for participant P 12 , then Num - Presentations is 7 . However , Num - Presentations can be aggregated for the whole experiment , resulting in the total amount of pre - sentations of a specific menu , e . g . , BHBi was presented 1 , 095 times , all 251 participants considered . ( 2 ) Preference - Matrix is a symmetric N × N matrix for which cells store the number of preference votes for menu m i when compared to m j . For example , if menu BHBi was preferred 79 times in direct comparisons with BHUni and other 25 comparisons were ties , then the corresponding cell of the Preference - Matrix contains 79 · 1 + 25 · 0 . 5 = 91 . 5 votes . Based on these considerations , our measures to quantify users’ preferences for the visual appearance of menus are as follows : ( 1 ) Absolute measures of preference ( reported per menu ) : ( a ) Preference - Rate represents the percentage of positive votes received by a specific menu , all participants con - sidered ; e . g . , if the BHBi menu design was preferred 551 times over other menus from a total number of 1 , 095 com - parisons , then its Preference - Rate is 551 / 1095 = 50 . 3 % . ( b ) Dismissal - Rate represents the percentage of negative votes received by a specific menu type , all participants considered ; e . g . , if the BHBi menu design from the previ - ous example was not the preferred option during 374 of the total number of comparisons , then its Dismissal - Rate is 374 / 1095 = 34 . 2 % . ( c ) Ties - Rate represents the percentage of tie votes received by a specific menu type , defined as 100 - ( Preference - Rate + Dismissal - Rate ) . For our example , Ties - Rate is 100 - ( 50 . 3 + 34 . 2 ) = 15 . 5 % . ( d ) Latent - Preference - Rate is the difference between the preference and dismissal percentages for a given menu type ; e . g . , the latent preference for the BHBi menu design is ( 551 - 374 ) / 1095 = 16 . 2 % . Note that Latent - Preference - Rate can take negative values as well between - 100 % ( ab - solute dismissal ) and 100 % ( absolute preference ) . ( 2 ) Measures of relative preference ( for pairs of menus ) : ( e ) Relative - Preference ( ρ i , j ) represents the probability that menu m i will be preferred to m j . We used the Bradley - Terry model [ 19 ] to estimate the probability that a menu design is preferable over the rest . The model works by as - signing strength parameters π i to each menu ( also called “abilities” ) , based on the idea that competition results in - form the underlying abilities of the competitors , which are menu designs in our case . The abilities π i provide a rank - ing of the menu designs , but also the relative preference probabilities for each menu m i , as follows : ρ i , j = π i π i + π j = 1 1 + e − ( loд ( π i ) − loд ( π j ) ) ( 1 ) where the first expression is easier to compute for our pur - poses and the second is suited for logistic modeling [ 70 ] . ( 3 ) Measures of aggregate preference ( reported for the en - tire set of menus ) : 6 Design Space and Users’ Preferences for Smartglasses Graphical Menus : A Vignette Study MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany ( f ) Concordance . We used Kendall’s [ 40 ] W coefficient of concordance to compute the agreement among partici - pants in terms of their rankings of the preferred menus . The W coefficient ranges from 0 ( no agreement , no overall trend ) to 1 ( absolute agreement , each participant has the same order of preferences , or ranking , for smartglasses menus ) . To compute W , we computed a ranking of the menus for each participant using a Borda count method starting from 1 ; see [ 27 ] for a description . Specifically , we assigned 3 points to each menu design when that menu won a direct A / B - type comparison , 2 points for each draw , and 1 point when the alternative menu was preferred . For example , if the BHBi menu design was preferred 551 times , dismissed 374 times , and ended up in a draw for 170 direct comparisons with other menu designs , its Borda count was 3 · 551 + 2 · 170 + 1 · 374 = 2 , 367 . 5 RESULTS We report in this section results on the absolute , relative , and ag - gregate preference regarding the visual appearance of smartglasses menus . But first , we discuss the representativeness of our sample of participants and the validity of the randomized A / B procedure . 5 . 1 Data Validity and Representativeness The data collected from our study , after removing the uncommitted participants ( see the previous section ) , are represented by 7 , 530 preference responses collected from 251 ( participants ) × 30 ( random - ized A / B trials ) regarding the visual appearance of 14 smartglasses menus designed with the shape , orientation , location , and item pre - sentation dimensions from our design space . In the following , we analyze the age and gender distribution of our participants and the random generation of the A / B pairs to confirm ( 1 ) the representa - tiveness of our sample for the target user population and ( 2 ) the validity of our randomized A / B procedure in terms of the number of presentations of each vignette . 5 . 2 Representativeness of Respondents Figure 4 illustrates the age - gender demographic distribution of our participants showing a good age coverage for both gender groups : female participants between 11 and 63 years old and males between 10 and 81 years . The figure also shows that age distributions are not normal ( an observation confirmed by Shapiro - Wilk tests , W = . 921 , p < . 001 for female and W = . 832 , p < . 001 for male participants , re - spectively ) with a higher representativeness of young people , less than 35 years old , in our sample . This outcome is fortunate , how - ever , as it is a known fact that young people use a greater breadth of technologies compared to older adults and are more open to new technology , whereas older adults are more likely to use tech - nologies that have been around for a longer period of time [ 55 ] . From this perspective , the population sample fits well the topic of our investigation , which is focused on understanding preferences for a new type of smart gadget made available only recently to the large public . Moreover , the mean ages are close for the two gender groups ( M = 32 . 8 , Mdn = 29 . 0 years for female and M = 30 . 4 , Mdn = 25 . 0 years for male participants , respectively , Wilcoxon’s rank sum

Although non significant results cannot be used to accept null hypotheses , they increase our confidence in the representativeness of our sample of participants . To summarize , we report in this study users’ preferences ( i ) across a large variety of age groups with ( ii ) similar age distributions for men and women , while ( iii ) the opinions of the age group most likely to adopt and use smartglasses , i . e . , young people less than 35 years old , are given appropriate representativeness in our sample . 5 . 3 Validity of the A / B Randomized Procedure Table 1 lists the number of presentations of each menu design across all the randomized A / B trials , e . g . , the BHBi design was presented 1 , 095 times , all participants considered , out of all the 7 , 530 ( A / B - type trials ) × 2 ( vignettes presented per trial ) = 15 , 060 total number of menu presentations . The expected number of presentations per menu is 15 , 060 divided by 14 ( distinct menu designs ) = 1 , 075 . The standard deviation was 16 . 98 with absolute errors varying between 0 and 32 ( 0 % and 2 . 98 % ) with respect to the expected mean . These results confirm that the randomized A / B procedure was applied correctly with no menu design being favored over the others in terms of a significantly larger presentation count .

The most preferred menu was SVBi ( i . e . , side location , vertical arrangement of items , and bimodal presentation using both text and icons ) with a preference rate of 66 . 4 % , 8 . 4 % ties , and a latent preference of 44 . 2 % . This result suggests that when menu items are presented on the side of the smartglasses to address peripheral vision , they should be aligned vertically to optimize navigation and visual search , while text descriptions should be presented next to the corresponding icons to assist exploration . The next three positions were occupied by the BHUni , THBi , and THUni menus with 63 . 7 % , 63 . 3 % , and 62 . 6 % preference rates and 35 . 5 % , 39 . 6 % , and 38 . 1 % latent preference rates , respectively . These findings show that if menu items are presented at the bottom or the top of the lenses , they should be presented horizontally and using icons only . The least preferred menu was MVUni , probably because of its middle location , likely to affect overall visibility , vertically arranged items being more difficult to scan , and taking up too much space with the bimodal presentation . Figure 6 reports preference rates for each applicable design di - mension , which we computed by counting the number of positive votes ( + 1 ) and half a vote for ties ( + 0 . 5 ) each time a specific menu was preferred to others . For instance , each time the BHBi menu ( bottom , horizontal , bimodal ) won a direct comparison , the bot - tom location received 1 point , the horizontal orientation received 1 point , and the bimodal modality of item presentation received 1 point , respectively . Similarly , each time the BHBi design ended up in a tie , each of its design options received 0 . 5 points . By divid - ing the result to the total number of presentations of each menu , we obtained the preference rates from Figure 6 . For example , the bottom location received 1 , 352 . 5 points from 2 , 202 direct compar - isons ( involving BHBi and BHUni ) and , thus , its preference rate was 1352 . 5 / 2202 · 100 % = 61 . 4 % . Also , the middle location received more points ( 3 , 398 . 5 ) from more comparisons ( 8 , 602 ) due to the MCBi , MCUni , MHBi , MHUni , MRBi , MRUni , MVBi , and MVUni designs , and resulted in a lower preference rate compared to the bottom location , 3398 . 5 / 8602 · 100 % = 39 . 5 % . Regarding the ori - entation and shape dimensions , the linear horizontal design was preferred in 58 . 5 % of the cases , followed by linear vertical ( 49 . 8 % ) , while the circular and rectangular designs both scored 37 % . The distribution between unimodal and bimodal designs was roughly equal , with slightly more preference for the bimodal presentation of menu items using both text and icons ( 51 . 1 % vs . 48 . 9 % ) . 5 . 5 Relative Preferences Besides the absolute preference rates , we were also interested in rel - ative preferences , e . g . , how likely is it for menu m i to be preferred over m j . To this end , we fit the Bradley - Terry model to our data us - ing the BradleyTerry2 R library [ 70 ] , which uses the glm . fit method with the binomial family and the logit link function . The model needed four Fisher scoring iterations to converge , and the analysis indicated a better fit ( AIC = 397 . 88 , residual deviance 105 . 73 , df = 64 ) compared to an intercept - only model ( AIC = 1088 , null deviance 1088 , df = 77 ) . Figure 7 reports the ability π i of each menu m i to win users’ pref - erences computed by the Bradley - Terry model [ 70 ] . These results confirmed our previous findings ( see Figure 5 ) : SVBi had the great - est ability ( 0 . 75 ) , followed by THBi ( 0 . 67 ) , THUni ( 0 . 61 ) , and BHUni ( 0 . 55 ) . We found no significant differences between SVBi and THBi ( Z = − 0 . 894 , p = . 371 , n . s . ) nor between SVBi and THUni ( Z = − 1 . 494 , p = . 135 , n . s . ) , but the SVBi menu design had significantly larger ability than all the other menus ( p < . 05 for BHUni and p < . 001 for the other menus ) to attract participants’ preferences . Based on the values of abilities π i and Eq . 1 , Figure 8 illustrates the probabilities ρ i , j that menu design m i will be preferred over menu m j , e . g . , SVBi ( side location , vertical orientation , bimodal presentation ) is likely to be preferred over MCUni ( middle , circular , unimodal ) in a direct comparison with 77 . 4 % chance . 5 . 6 Aggregate Preference We employed Kendall’s [ 40 ] W coefficient of concordance to un - derstand the consensus between participants’ rankings of menus , which we computed using the Borda count [ 27 ] . We found W = 0 . 109 ( χ 2 ( 250 ) = 356 . 32 , p < . 001 ) , a result that indicates low consensus and a diversity of rankings for the set of fourteen menus . Our pre - vious analysis of cumulated preferences showed that consensus over particular menu designs emerged nonetheless despite a wide variety of individual rankings ; see Figure 5 . However , this result suggests that groups of participants with similar preferences in terms of menu rankings could potentially be identified by running further exploratory analysis . For example , we found that male par - ticipants were slightly more in agreement about their menu rank - ings than female participants ( W = 0 . 120 vs . W = . 094 , respectively , both p < . 001 ) . 6 DISCUSSION We present in this section a summary of our results , which we distill into takeaways . We also discuss limitations of our experiment and suggest ways to address those limitations in future work . 6 . 1 Summary of Results and Takeaways Our empirical results showed location to be the most determinant variable for smartglasses graphical menus with some design op - tions for location winning participants’ preferences in over 60 % 8 Design Space and Users’ Preferences for Smartglasses Graphical Menus : A Vignette Study MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany abc… abc… 61 . 2 % 61 . 4 % 69 . 4 % 58 . 5 % 49 . 8 % 37 . 9 % 37 . 0 % 39 . 5 % 48 . 9 % 51 . 1 % side bottom top middle horizontal vertical circular rectangular unimodal bimodal Figure 6 : Preference rates for various design options regarding menu location , orientation , shape , and item presentation . 0 . 75 0 . 67 0 . 61 0 . 55 0 . 43 0 . 24 - 0 . 19 - 0 . 23 - 0 . 26 - 0 . 26 - 0 . 45 - 0 . 48 - 0 . 58 - 0 . 80 - 1 . 50 - 1 . 00 - 0 . 50 0 . 00 0 . 50 1 . 00 S V B i T H B i T H U n i B H U n i B H B i S V U n i M H B i M R B i M V B i M H U n i M R U n i M C U n i M C B i M V U n i B r a d l e y - T e rr y e s t i m a t e d a b ili t i e s l o g ( π ) Figure 7 : Bradley - Terry abilities estimated for each menu .

Next followed orientation , shape , and item presentation . In the following , we summarize takeaways , implications , and ideas for future work : 6 . 1 . 1 The location of the visual menus should be chosen to minimize interference with the visual scene , achieving thus good visual search and good utilization of the screen real estate . Our results showed that the top location was the most preferred option ( 69 . 1 % votes ) , followed by bottom ( 61 . 4 % ) and side ( 61 . 2 % ) . These findings suggest interesting directions for future work in terms of positioning con - tent , including menu items and other controls , for smartglasses UIs . For example , the bottom location is normally reserved for proximal vision , useful for reading , while the top location can be assimilated with far - away vision . Consequently , contextual menus could be displayed either at the top or the bottom , depending on the task at hand , e . g . , reading or performing visual search . Also , an interesting fact about side menus ( 61 . 2 % preference votes ) is that they do not require the user to shift the focus of attention to the menu and then back to the visual scene , as menu perception can be achieved with the peripheral vision . Our participants’ preferences for side menus is a finding in line with performance results from prior work that reported users spending 50 % less time looking at the side menu on their smartglasses by exploiting peripheral vision [ 21 ] . 6 . 1 . 2 Menus should not be displayed in the middle . Our results showed that the middle location was the least preferred among all the design options for the location dimension ( 39 . 5 % ; see Fig - ure 6 ) , while all the menu designs that featured this option scored preference rates below average ( less than 43 % ; see Figure 5 , left ) and negative latent preference rates ( between − 1 . 4 % for the MVBi design and − 44 . 9 % for MVUni ; see Figure 5 , right ) . 6 . 1 . 3 The arrangement and orientation of menu items should opti - mize visual scanning . The vertical orientation for presenting menu items is not only convenient for the side location ( i . e . , the SVBi and SVUni designs ranked first and sixth place , respectively ; see Fig - ure 5 ) , but is also efficient for visual scanning . When items are left justified , there is no need to reacquire item locations ; when items are located and arranged in ways that are consistent across existing applications , they match the common locations where users nor - mally expect menus to be positioned , facilitating thus visual search . Overall , the horizontal orientation was preferred for 58 . 5 % of the menu designs located at the bottom ( 61 . 4 % ) and the top ( 69 . 4 % ) of the lenses ; see Figure 6 . 6 . 1 . 4 Menu designs with 2 - D navigation were often dismissed in favor of linearly structured menus . Both circular and rectangular menus were the least preferred ( 37 . 9 % and 37 . 0 % ; see Figure 6 ) . A possible explanation is that these designs suggested a spatial navigation scheme that was perceived more difficult to perform compared to the more simple , linear structure of the horizontal and vertical menu designs . Also , both circular and rectangular shapes require more screen real estate to display compared to linear menus . However , 2 - D menus may be useful to depict commonly accepted 2 - D orderings of items , such as the digits of 3 × 3 numerical key - boards . Further studies are needed to understand the compromise between preference and performance for such designs . 6 . 1 . 5 Unimodal and bimodal presentations of menu items are equally acceptable . Our empirical results revealed little difference between the unimodal ( graphical icons only ) and bimodal ( text and graphi - cal icons ) presentation of menu items ( 48 . 9 % and 51 . 1 % preference votes , respectively ; see Figure 6 ) . This finding suggests new de - sign ideas , such as a smooth transition from bimodal to unimodal menus could also be acceptable to users , while saving screen space 9 MUM 2020 , November 22 – 25 , 2020 , Essen , Germany Radu - Daniel Vatavu and Jean Vanderdonckt and fostering learnability . For example , when menus are first dis - played , their presentation could be bimodal , after which menus could progressively switch to a unimodal graphical presentation to free screen space for expert users . 6 . 2 Limitations We conducted in this work a large - scale user study ( N = 251 partici - pants ) by taking advantage of a vignette - based experiment design , a web - based tool and online participation , a randomized A / B testing procedure [ 72 ] , and simple instructions provided to participants regarding the evaluation of the visual appearance of smartglasses menu designs . We managed to foster large participation and com - mitment from our participants to complete the tasks , but we also acknowledge several limitations of our experiment , as follows : ( 1 ) To keep the user study practical in terms of the workload expected from participants , we defined and applied two guid - ing principles to reduce the number of dimensions from our design space that we utilized to generate the menu design options and the corresponding vignettes . The dimensions that were not considered were item scrolling , item count , selection indicator , and dimensionality . Future work is rec - ommended to examine each dimension in depth to uncover more findings about users’ preferences . ( 2 ) In accordance with the specific nature of vignette studies , we did not influence participants in any way regarding their possible interpretations of the vignettes . Instead , we let par - ticipants define the parameters of visual appearance regard - ing smartglasses menus that mattered and made sense the most for them ; see Barter and Renold [ 14 ] and Finch [ 30 ] for the benefits of having respondents defining the situation depicted by the vignettes by themselves as well as our dis - cussion from Section 4 in this regard . Future user studies , such as in - the - lab controlled studies , could measure objec - tive dependent variables regarding the visual aesthetics of graphical UIs , such as variables informed by the metrics em - ployed in [ 88 ] . We believe that correlating the values of such objective variables with the self - defined notion of visual ap - pearance will be interesting to explore and will lead to new discoveries for smartglasses graphical menus . ( 3 ) Since our experiment was a vignette study , we used graphical representations of possible designs for smartglasses menus instead of actual implementations on a specific device . This approach brought us several advantages , such as the possibil - ity to conduct evaluations of visual appearance without any influence from specific operating systems or models of smart - glasses that might have biased our participants’ responses as well as to reach a wide range of participants of different age , cultural backgrounds and professional fields . However , generalization of our findings to actual implementations of smartglasses menus should be done with care . Instead , our empirical results should be seen as the first set of data , col - lected using a large and diverse sample of potential end users , on which to base further explorations . In the next section we suggest ways to address these limitations with several ideas for future work regarding graphical menu design for smartglasses . 7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We reported in this paper preference results collected from a vi - gnette experiment with large participation conducted to compare various design options for smartglasses graphical menus . These results represent the first attempt in the community to structure de - sign knowledge for visual menus and smartglasses . Consequently , it is our hope that our work will generate constructive discussion and lead to more studies on smartglasses menus toward accumulating practical design knowledge in this regard . Several future work directions can be envisaged . For example , we employed only some of Bertin’s [ 15 ] visual variables to keep the design space manageable for practitioners . Exploration of other variables are recommended , such as color ( e . g . , showing menus with color saturation and / or brightness levels in correspondence with the visual scene ) ; more orientations ( e . g . , items displayed horizon - tally and vertically ) and shapes ( pie , semi - circular , etc . ) ; distributed menus , for which inspiration can be drawn from designing dis - tributed UIs [ 51 ] ( e . g . , splitting menu items across the two lenses or displaying one menu on the left lens and sub - menus on the right one ) ; adaptive menus [ 17 , 31 ] in which menu items are displayed according to their frequency of use ; or animated menus [ 43 ] , includ - ing visual effects , e . g . , a smartglasses menu that fades into view . In our experiment , we considered just four of the eight dimensions of our design space in order to keep the experiment manageable and foster commitment from our participants to complete the task . Future work can focus on each dimension individually , including the dimensions that we did not consider in this study , such as item scrolling or selection indicator , to complete our understanding about users’ preferences of the visual appearance of smartglasses menus . Studies addressing the preferences of participants with visual impairments [ 60 ] regarding the display of menu items on smartglasses as well as of participants with upper - body motor im - pairments [ 48 , 49 ] for controlling smartglasses menus , including via touchscreens on mobile devices [ 71 , 75 , 76 ] , wearables [ 32 ] , and chairables [ 20 ] , are equally recommended for examination in future work . While the explorations of such directions will definitely con - tribute important information in the community , our design space can already be employed to assist practitioners in their designs of graphical menus for smartglasses .
