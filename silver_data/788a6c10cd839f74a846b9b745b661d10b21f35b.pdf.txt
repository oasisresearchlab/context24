Three types of strain , i . e . stretching , tilt and curvature , are distinguished and the associated stresses are identified . It is argued that in the case of vesicles ( = closed bilayer films ) the only elasticity controlling nonspherical shapes is that of curvature . Euler - Lagrange equations are derived for the shape in magnetic fields and under excess outside pressure . It is shown that magnetic fields can deform spherical vesicles into ellipsoids of revolution . Under excess outside pressure the spherical shape becomes unstable at a certain threshold pressure . Both effects can be influenced by a spontaneous curvature of the bilayer . Some possible experiments to determine the elastic properties are also discussed . I . Introduction Lipid bilayers are a subject of some interest as they appear to be closely related to biological mem­ branes . They are attractive systems to study because , apart from thermal fluctuations , they can be homo­ geneous down to molecular dimensions . According­ ly , their mechanical properties should permit a con­ tinuum - mechanical description . The present article deals with the presumable elasticity of lipid bilayers . It is hoped that the continuum concept is transfer­ able to biological membranes , although this may re­ quire averaging over areas involving hundreds of lipid molecules , since the presence of proteins de­ stroys local homogeneity . Lipid molecules consist of a polar head and one or two hydrocarbon chains . In an aqueous environ­ ment they tend to assemble as bimolecular sheets with the hydrophilic heads on the outsides and the hydrophobic chains in the interior of the film . Bi­ layers can often be prepared in such a way that they close to form vesicles whose diameters range from a few hundred angstroms1 to some millimeters2 . We may think of bilayers as solid or fluid , depend­ ing on whether the lipid molecules form a two - dimensional lattice or not . The rather smooth con­ tours of biological and bilayers vesicles observed in electron microscopy suggest that the membranes are two - dimensional fluids , at least those capable of forming vesicles . ( Bilayers may have two or more phases differing largely by the conformation of the Requests for reprints should be sent to W .

It seems an open question if some low temperature phases can be regarded as quasi - solid . ) The following description of membrane elastici­ ty is based on the assumption of unrestricted internal fluidity . In addition , we take the “average” direction of the more or less flexible hydrocarbon chains to be normal to the bilayer , thus ruling out a spontaneous collective tilt of the lipid molecules . This assumption may not always be cor­ rect . Recent X - ray work revealed the existence of lyotropic smectic liquid crystals consisting of tilted bilayers 4 . On the other hand , a long - range tilt neces­ sitates singularities in closed bilayers which might show as sharp points or ridges , again at variance with most electron micrographs of vesicles . The elasticity of lipid bilayers may be viewed as a special case of the well - established theory of thin elastic shells5 . Fluidity amounts to a vanishing shear modulus . For our purpose it appears pre­ ferable not to start from a general mathematical apparatus but to base a suitable elastic theory on straightforward physical considerations . In a preceding note we have already given a formula for the ellipsoidal deformation of spherical vesicles by magnetic fields6 . It was obtained by minimizing the sum of the curvature - elastic and magnetic energies of the vesicle as a function of its ellipticity . In the present article we discuss the various possible elastic strains and stresses of bi­ layers and show that curvature should , in general , be the only strain governing the shape of nonspheri­ cal vesicles . Euler - Lagrange equations are formu­ lated which permit to rederive the magnetic de - 694 W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers formation in a much simpler way , giving at the same time the complete balance of the forces and torques acting on the bilayer . They also serve to show that under excess outside pressure the spherical shape of a vesicle should become unstable above a certain threshold . Some direct experiments on vesicles which offer themselves for determining the curvature - elastic moduli and the spontaneous curvature of bi - layers are discussed in detail at the end of the article . II . Elastic Strains and Stresses A . Stretching A lipid bilayer is deformable in more than one way . Let us first consider changes in area due to tension , i . e . tangential stress . For weak deforma­ tions the elastic energy of stretching per unit area , ws , must be a quadratic function of Aa / a , the re­ lative change in area a . We may write ws = 1 / 2 ks ( Aa / a ) 2 , ( 1 ) where k & is the elastic modulus of stretching with the dimensions of energy per unit area . The cor­ responding stress , a force per length , is °s = ks ( Aa / a ) ( 2 ) or in vector notation crs = ks ( Aafa ) e . ( 3 ) The dimensionless unit vector e is normal to the imaginary cut on which acts from the side to which e points . Naturally , both G and o are parallel or , in the presence of curvature , tangential to the bilayer . The modulus ks may be obtained by mea­ suring the swelling of spherical vesicles as a function of internal excess pressure . A bilayer is capable of exchanging lipid mole­ cules with its aqueous environment . For this reason , the elastic forces upon stretching may last only a limited time . The relaxation is apt to be very slow because of the small solubility of lipids in water . With vesicles it may be further hindered by the need for lipid molecules to flip from one side of the film to the other 7 . A stress which we may ignore here is hydrostatic pressure . It may influence Aa / a , but we think that in practice this is not an important effect . ( An esti­ mate is possible on the basis of the considerations of HE . ) Another strain , a change in membrane thick­ ness , is also disregarded . Being only about 50 Ä for phospholipid bilayers , the thickness cannot be uniquely defined and measured . B . Tilt A straight membrane can be submitted to a tor­ que density , for instance by applying an oblique magnetic field acting on magnetically anisotropic lipid molecules . The counter - balancing elastic tor­ que per unit area , m t , must be provided by a nor­ mal force per unit length : ort = m t A e . ( 4 ) The strain underlying Ttlt and at is a tilt of the lipid molecules away from their average normal orientation , as sketched in Fig . 1 . Denoting the layer Fig . 1 . Highly schematic diagram of untilted and tilted bilayers . Despite their actual flexibility the lipid chains are depicted as straight lines . normal by W and the average orientation of the molecules by d , both dimensionless unit vectors , we may write for the elastic energy per unit area wt = 1 / 2 kt ( n A d ) 2 , ( 5 ) where the dimension of the tilt - elastic modulus is again energy per unit area . Obviously , there are two ways to remove the tilt . One is to rotate the lipid molecules at fixed position , the other is to rotate the piece of bilayer as a whole at fixed mole­ cular orientation . The torque density is given by mt = - kt ( n A d ) . ( 6 ) Eqn . ( 4 ) is , of course , confirmed by the microscopic picture . An exact expression of wt as a function of tilt would have to take account of the various parts of the lipid molecule , their average tilts probably being not the same . However , tilt should be minute and its elastic energy negligible in most practical cases ( see below ) , so is appears pointless to develop a detailed molecular therory . C . Curvature Finally , we consider curvature of the bilayer . For a convenient description we may use a local right - handed cartesian coordinate system , putting its origin in a given point of the film which is thought n u n / / / / / / nm in j Ji Unfitted Tilted W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers 695 to be infinitely thin . The z axis is made parallel to the local layer normal 71 . Regarding W as a function of x and y , we can define the two independent cur­ vatures at the origin cx = d n jd x , cy = dn7 / d y . ( 7 ) The rotation of the vector field 71 ( x , y ) must vanish as it is normal to a uniquely defined surface . There­ fore , the relation d n jd y — dny / dx = 0 ( 8 ) hat to be satisfied by the cross derivatives . The elastic energy of the curvature is assumed to be a quadratic function of the derivatives of nx and ny . The two - dimensional fluid being rotationally symmetric , only those linear and quadratic forms can enter that are independent of the orientation of the x and y axes . They are d n jd x + d n y / d y , ( 9 ) ( d n jd x + driy / dy ) 2 , ( 10 ) 3 nx 3a : 3 nx dnx 3 y dnx ( 11 ) 3 y By 3x The curvature - elastic energy per unit area may be written as > , = h k . / 3 nx 3ny \ 3a : 3 y + kc dnx Briir 3 / ^ x 3nv ( 12 ) 3a : 3 y 3 y 3a : The curvature - elastic moduli kc and kc have the di­ mension of energy . The linear term ( 9 ) is incor­ porated through c0 . The spontaneous curvature c0 allows for bilayers whose two sides are chemically different . The sign of c0 depends , of course , on the arbitrary polarity of 71 . The expressions ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) are analogous to splay and saddle splay as introduced by Frank8 in dealing with the curvature elasticity of liquid crystals . It may be noted that Eqn . ( 12 ) can hold only if tilt in the sense defined above is negligible . ( Otherwise 71 must be replaced by one or more directors d . ) Formulas ( 7 ) to ( 12 ) remain valid if a single global coordinate system is used instead of the local ones , 71 still being a function of x and y . The only exception is ( 8 ) which becomes 3 _ _ riy _ 3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ nx t2 - n y2 ) 1 / s 3 y ( 1 - n x2 - n y2 ) Vl ( 13 ) dx ( 1 ( A prove may be based on curl grad z = 0 where z ( x , y ) describes the surface . ) Here , and in the fol­ lowing , we use nz = ( 1 — nx2 — ny2 ) , / j to eliminate raz . Let us introduce the elastic energy density per unit area in the x , y plane gc = w j ( 1 — nx2 — ny2 ) , / l . ( 14 ) It can serve as a starting point to derive Euler - Lagrange equations governing the curvature of bi­ layers ( see below ) . Here , we only want to show that the total “saddle splay” energy is independent of the size and shape of a membrane with fixed boundary conditions ( fixed 71 on the contour ) . The energy in question is _ \ i i Bnx 3 riy 3 ns 3 gc dx Ay = dx 3 y 3 y da : d y 3a ; ( 1 — ti x2 — ny2 ) 1 / 2 ^ ^ It is extreme if gc satisfies the two differential equa­ tions 3 3 3 a : 3 3 | c 3 nn dx 3 y n 3«u 3 " 3 7 = 0 , ( 16 ) where u = x , y . The left - hand side of the first equa­ tion is kt — k , + kc I 3 nx 3 ny 3 nx 3ny \ \ 3x 3 y 3 y 3r / 3 3 7ly 1 3a : 3 y ( 1 — Tlx2 — 3 3 ny 1 3 y dx ( 1 - n 2 - n / Y " ( 1 - n x2 - n y2 ) s / s ( 17 ) Inspection shows that the left - hand sides of both equations are identical to zero for any function U ( x , y . ) An energy depending solely on boundary condi­ tions , while causing stresses , produces no torque or force densities . As a consequence , the “saddle splay” term can be omitted in many calculations , in agreement with the role of saddle splay in liquid crystals . The stresses conjugate to curvature are torques per unit length . In order to compute them it is help­ ful to imagine a small rectangular piece of bilayer which is slightly and ( practically ) uniformly curved by applying such torques . We employ local coordi­ nates and keep | nx | , J 7iy I ^ 1 on the whole piece . Simple energy considerations show that the torque 696 W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers per unit length , t , may be given the form T = ( ci + c2 ) ' iV " A ® ) + * c [ c2 ( n A c 1 ) - - ( « r c ) ( 18 ) + Ci ( n A e2 ) • ( e2 - e ) ] . Here < ? x and C2 are orthogonal unit vectors tangen­ tial to the bilayer . They represent the principal axes of curvature for which the cross derivatives of It vanish . The principal curvatures along and < ? 2 are c1 and c2 , respectively . In analogy to other elastic problems , one can obtain the torque density ( per unit area ) by forming derivatives of r . Doing this , one finds that the terms containing kc drop out as expected . D . Nonlinear curvature - elastic stresses The stresses treated so far are linear functions of the respective strains . However , vesicles possess an inherent curvature even in their undeformed , spheri­ cal state . This points to the necessity of including stresses varying as the product of two curvatures . A first stress quadratic in curvature is an aniso­ tropic tangential stress to be called directed tension . Its existence is quickly demonstrated by means of a tube of bilayer , the radius being R and the length L . The total curvature - elastic energy is , for c0 = 0 , Ee = ll2 k c ( 2njR ) L . ( 19 ) With constant area A = 2 n R L ( 20 ) one has AEJAR = - K ( A / R 3 ) . ( 21 ) Accordingly , there must be a normal force per unit area which is f„ = i c ( n / R3 ) , ( 22 ) if the layer normal tl points outward . The force is linked with a tension parallel to the lines of circum­ ference a „ _ - M l / f i 2 ) . ( 23 ) Both fn and ov can be balanced by an external force supplied , for instance , by a cylindrical constraint such as a solid tube . In this case , there is no tension along the cylinder axis . The tube may also be stabi­ lized by an isotropic tension offsetting the circum­ ferential tension so that only a tension parallel to the axis is left . This happens naturally if the length of the tube is prescribed by two supporting walls of fixed distance , provided 111 axis . Slightly more complex arguments allowing for c0 = 0 and two non - vanishing principal curvatures result in a complete formula for the directed tension induced by curvature < ? & T = - k c ( c1 + c2 - c 0 ) [ c1e1 ( e1 - e ) + c2 e 2 ( e2• e ) ] — kt c1 c2 e . ( 24 ) The net anisotropy of tension may be expressed by the difference o2 — o1 of the directed tensions along the principal axes of curvature . Naturally , o ^ r is equal in all directions on a sphere and thus there is net isotropy . Net anisotropy gives rise to shear stresses along imaginary cuts that are not parallel to the principal axes . Another stress quadratic in curvature compen­ sates for the tendency of the lipid material to move into regions of lower curvature - elastic energy . This isotropic tension is simply given by < C = wce . ( 25 ) Other quadratic effects concern the force densities . The normal force produced by the combination of tension and curvature is well known from soap bubbles , etc . Conversely , a normal force per unit length ( normal stress ) in a curved bilayer causes a tanegntial force per unit area . E . Estimate of the elastic moduli It is natural to suppose that the only elasticity influencing the expansion of a spherical vesicle under excess internal pressure is that of stretching . On the other hand , if a vesicle is non - spherical , one may expect its shape to be controlled largely by curvature elasticity . To put these assumptions on a firm basis , we estimate the different elastic moduli . The elastic energy densities can be approximated by a sum of nearest - neighbor contributions . Each of them is roughly the molecular energy of conden­ sation , on the order of 1 eV , times the squared re­ lative change of the intermolecular distance or orien­ tation . In this picture the elastic energy per mole­ cule is about 1 eV 10 - 12 erg if | Aa / a | , | tl Adi , and | c d \ I are about unity , d \ being the intermole­ cular spacing . With a density of 1015 molecules per cm2 one obtains ks = 103 erg cm - 2 , kt = 103 erg cm - 2 , ( 26 ) kc = 10 - 12 erg . The smallness of kc is due to the fact that for a curvature of 1 cm - 1 , i . e . a rotation of tl by ca . W . Helfridi • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers 697 60° over 1 cm , the average orientations of adjacent molecules differ by only ( 10 ~ 15 ) , / ! times this angle . By way of contrast , microscopic and macroscopic deformations are equally strong for stretch and tilt , Aafa and Tl A d representing the relative change on both scales . Despite the obvious crudeness of such a model , the estimates for ka and kc are not too far from what one would guess on the basis of the known volume elastic moduli of organic liquids ( « * 109 dyn cm - 2 ) and the curvature elastic moduli of liquid crystals 10 ~ 6 dyn ) . Multiplying those by the thickness of the bilayer ( approx . 50 Ä ) , one arrives at ks = 5 • 102 dyn cm - 2 and kc = 5 • 10 ~ 13 erg . An interesting number is the total curvature elastic energy E of a spherical vesicle , E = 8 Ji kc ( l —r0 c0 / 2 ) 2 + 4 Jt kc . ( 27 ) With A ; c = 0 , kc = 5 • 10 - 13 erg and c0 = 0 one com­ putes the very small value of 8 eV , independently of the radius of the vesicle . Although our estimates may be wrong by a power of ten or more , it appears that the energy E could effect only a minor stretch­ ing of the bilayer unless the vesicle comprises just a few tens of molecules . The same energetical reasoning holds for tilt , but in practice tilt is even less likely since any torques produce tilt only local­ ly , while tangential forces may stretch a piece of bilayer . It is now clear that curvature should be negligible in the swelling of vesicles , apart from special cases . However , curvature will dominate if the volume of a vesicle is reduced below the value characterized by a vanishing total tension in the spherical bilayer . In such cases , one can always find nonspherical vesicle shapes which require no stretching ( change in area ) or tilt of the bilayer . Curvature being the easiest deformation , it seems permissible to entirely neglect tilt and stretching in any calculus of variation de­ termining the vesicle shape . This approach is used in the following discussion of the deformation of spheres . It is also applied to the small changes in shape which are possible , e . g . in a magnetic field , without a significant decrease in volume . III . Problems of Rotational Symmetry We are interested in the deformations of spherical bilayer vesicles . In many cases the deformed shape can be expected to be rotationally symmetric . It may then be described by a function r ( 0 ) , r being the distance from some origin within the vesicle and 6 the polar angle . However , r ( 6 ) is not well suited to derive a differential equation for the shape . Since r as well as its first and second derivatives enter the curvatures , a second - order calculus of variation ensues which leads to a fourth - order differential equation . It is preferable to employ another rota­ tionally symmetric function , namely ip { x ) , where x is the distance from the polar axis and ip the angle made by the layer normal with the polar axis . An illustration is given in Fig . 2 . As will be seen im - ~ h a Fig . 2 . Coordinates for the description of rotationally sym­ metric shapes . mediately , ip ( x ) permits a standard calculus of variation resulting in a second - order differential equation . The shape of the vesicle is not directly given by ip ( x ) , but it can be obtained by an inte­ gration . For instance , we may introduce a coordi­ nate z along the polar axis , indicated in Fig . 1 b . The integral z ( x ) = J tan i / ; ( t ) dt ( 28 ) o renders the contour of the vesicle . Both ip { x ) and z ( x ) have upper and lower branches which need not be the mirror images of each other . A . Film between circles On any rotationally symmetric surface one can define in a unique fashion two sets of orthogonal lines corresponding to the meridians and parallels of a sphere . The principal curvatures of the surface 698 W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers are along these lines and will be designated cm and cp , respectively . For the upper branch of ip ( x ) in Fig . 2 they are cm = cosip ( dipfdx ) , cv = sin ip / x , ( 29 ) if the layer normal is taken to point outward . It will be sufficient here to explicity consider only the upper branch . Limiting our attetnion to a piece of bilayer between the circles Xj and x 2 , we have for the total curvature - elastic energy — 2 7Z X f [ 2 kc ( cm - | - Cp Cq ) “ - | - kc cm Cp ] dx , ( 30 ) XI COS ip the square bracket representing the energy density ( per cm2 ) . To express our assumption that the bi­ layer is unstretchable , we adopt the auxiliary con­ dition of constant area , J ( 2 x / cos ty’ ) dx = const . ( 31 ) The auxiliary condition of no tilt is automatically satisfied by our formula for the curvature - elastic energy . We are now in a position to set up an Euler - Lagrange equation for the shape of rotationally symmetric bilayers . Combining ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) yields the integrand / of our variational problem , / V - ’’ dip dx 1 7 | dip sin ip 2 kc cos u —— + dx x r . dip 1 . + kc cos ip sin ip — - - - - - - - + / dx x 2 ji x cos ip ( 32 ) = 0 . ( 33 ) where X is a Lagrange multiplier . The integral of / is at an extreme if ip satisfies 3 / _ d 3 f _ dip dx 3 ( dip / dx ) Carrying out the differentiations , one finds that the kc terms drop out as anticipated . The Euler - Lagrange equation ( 33 ) divided by 2 Jixf cos ip can be read as a balance of elastic torque densities . Multiplying ( 33 ) by cos2 ip , one obtains the con­ venient form ^ C ( ^ m " t - C0 ) Cm 2 7Z x sin Ip + 5 kc ( cm + Cp - c0 ) 2 2 n x sin ip + k2 7ixsinip ( 34 ) — kc cos ip d ( cm Cp ) dx 2 n x cos ip + 0 . Now we have a balance of the elastic forces in z direction . The first term , without the factor 2 n x sin ip , stands for the directed tension , the force being parallel to the local meridian . The second term , without 2 n x sin ip , is the isotropic tension 0 * 0° . The Lagrange multiplier X must then be an iso­ tropic tension , i . e . a tangential force per unit length , which is uniform throughout the film . The fourth term , without the factor 2 n x cos ip , is the normal stress ot . Apart from boundary conditions ip1 = ip ( x i ) and ip2 = ip { x2 ) we may , for instance , prescribe the total surface area . Eqn . ( 34 ) allows indeed for three ad­ justable parameters , one of them being / . The distance z ( x 2 ) — z ( x j ) between the rings assumes the value of minimum energy , i . e . of vanishing force F z . If the force Fz is non - zero , one has to add to the integrand ( 32 ) the terms — F . , tan ip which results in the additional term — F , on the left - hand side of Eqn . ( 34 ) . ( Fz is positive for pull and negative for push . ) B . Deformation of spherical vesicles by a magnetic field A magnetic field exerts a torque on a magnetical­ ly anisotropic film . The effect of a uniform field H parallel to the z axis is taken into account by adding the orientational energy per unit area , - ( 1 / 2 ) ( * „ - * . ) b cos2vH * , ( 35 ) to the square bracket of the integrand ( 32 ) . We ex­ press the susceptibilities per unit area for fields normal and tangential to the bilayer by j£n b and Xt b , where b is a measure for the thickness of the bilayer . The Euler - Lagrange equation of the prob­ lem may be given the form [ h ( cm + Cp Cq ) Cm + l / 2 kc ( cm + Cp Cq ) 2 — 1 / 2 ( xn — xt ) b H2 cos2 ip + A ] sin ip ( 36 ) + ( Zn - Xt ) ^ H2 cos ip sin ip — kc cos ip d ( cm + Cp ) dx cos ip = 0 The two magnetic terms arising from the variation are left separate in order to display their physical meanings . The first square bracket represents a tangential force per unit length and the second a normal one . It has been shown previously 6 that a magnetic field may transform a spherical vesicle into an el­ lipsoid of revolution . The earlier proof was based W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers 699 on energy considerations , here we use the Euler - Lagrange equation ( 36 ) for the same purpose . In polar coordinates the ellipsoidal deformation may be described by s = r — r0 = s2 P2 ( cos 6 ) = s2 ( 3 / 2 ) ( cos2 G —1 / 3 ) , ( 37 ) where P2 is the second Legendre polynomial and r0 the radius of the sphere . In terms of xp ( x ) we have 3 s . , Axp ( x ) = xp ( x ) — xpx ( x ) = - — — cos xpt ( x ) sin xpx ( x ) , 2 rn where the function sin xpx = x / r0 ( 38 ) ( 39 ) represents the original sphere . These formulas are valid only for very small deformations , i . e . ! s2 j ^ r0 . The radius r0 is used in ( 39 ) even though the equatorial radius of the deformed vesicle differs from r0 . The associated change in bilayer area is immaterial in our approximation . There are two equivalent representations for the curvatures to first order in the deformation . They are JL ro 1 rft d2 cos 0 ds sinö rn2 dO ( 40 ) and + + d dx cos xp ( cos xp Axp ) , Ay * . ( 41 ) Inserting the curvatures in ( 36 ) , and equating the terms proportional to s2 and dependent on 6 or x , one obtains ” 3 ( * n ~ 2t ) & H2 S2 = - 3 ( 6 - c0 r0 ) ka ( 42 ) Terms quadratic in s2 are meaningless in the present approximation . If terms proportional to s2 are omit­ ted , i . e . with H = 0 , the stress X is A = l k c - ^ ( 2 - c o ro ) . ( 43 ) The ellipsoid is oblate for % n — Xt > 0 and prolate for Xn — Xt < 0 , provided c0 r0 < 6 . A completely different situation to be discussed below arises for co ro = & Another extension of the shape equation ( 35 ) in­ cludes a difference Ap = pe — pi between external and internal pressure . In this case , the integrand of the variational problem becomes C .

( The first Legendre polynomial describes a translation , not a deforma­ tion . ) Using ( 37 ) , one can express x as a function of s2 and 0 and employ representation ( 40 ) for the curvatures . Alternatively , one may use representa­ tion ( 41 ) and write x as function of s2 and xp : . ( 3 s . , x = r0 sin I xp cos xp sin xp 2 r0 ” - ' T " " T / ( 46 ) = r0 sin xp — ( 3 / 2 ) s2 cos2 xp sin xp . When the insertions are made in Eqn ( 45 ) one ob­ tains X = I kc 0 ( 2 - c0 r0 ) AP ( 47 ) from the constant terms , and Apc = ( 2 kc / r03 ) ( 6 - C q r0 ) ( 48 ) from those proportional to s2 and varying with 6 or x . At the pressure difference Apc the vesicle is in neutral equilibrium with respect to ellipsoidal de­ formations , the amplitude s2 being arbitrary in the linear approximation . Obviously , Apc in ( 48 ) re­ presents a threshold pressure for the deformation of the spherical shape , which is indicated by the sub­ script c . Any infinitesimal deformation correspond­ ing to higher Legendre polynomials than P2 would require larger pressure differences than Ap c . 700 W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers We may infer that weak enough deformations under pressure are indeed ellipsoidal . However , the vesicle shape cannot be expected to be a continuous function of Ap . As the ellipsoid is prolate for s0 > 0 and oblate for s2 < 0 , a change in sign of s2 leads to a physically non - equivalent situation . Consequently , there may be an abrupt deformation when a rising Ap passes Apc and an abrupt return to the spherical shape somewhere below Apc as Ap is dropping . To make this more plausible , we exploit an analogy of Landau’s theory of second - order phase transitions . Regarding s2 as an order parameter , we think the total free energy E of the vesicle , due to curvature and Ap , to be expanded up to fourth power in s2 . The difference Apc — Ap takes the role of the temperature difference T — T c in Landau’s theory , and we may write E = a ( Apc — Ap ) s22 + B s23 + C s24 • ( 49 ) Since E is as asymmetric in s2 , the cubic term will , in general , not vanish and the transition will not be of second but of first order . ( There can be no linear term since the sphere is an equilibrium state . ) Accordingly , the deformation is discontinuous and displays hysteresis , i . e . the analogs of superheating and supercooling . In the quadratic approximation the sign of s2 is free and the ellipsoidal deformation need not be rotationally symmetric . These ambi­ guities disappear in an abrupt transition ( but the deformedshape may be asymmetric with respect to the equatorial plane ) . The calculation of the total free energy up to fourth order in s2 or , equivalently , of the stresses up to third order is tedious and not attempted here . Eqn ( 49 ) would give poor results if higher powers of s2 and higher Legendre polynomials are im­ portant . ( Associated Legendre functions have to be considered if rotational symmetry is abandoned . ) Also , theoretically sharp transitions and hysteresis effects are possibly washed out by thermal fluc­ tuations because of the probable weakness of curva­ ture elasticity ( see below ) . In our approximation , these fluctuations should diverge at the transition . The deformability ( 42 ) of vesicles in a magnetic field goes to infinity and the threshold pressure ( 48 ) to zero as c0 approaches the value of 6 / r0 . Apparent­ ly , the spherical shape is in neutral equilibrium at c0 r0 = 6 without the action of any external forces . For even larger c0 , i . e . for spontaneous curvatures at least six times stronger than that of the sphere , the vesicle will be nonspherical . Its shape is likely to be prolate because thus the curvature can assume its large spontaneous value over most of the bilayer area . The deformation caused by spontaneous curva­ ture can , of course , be removed by applying a nega­ tive Ap , the critical value again being given by Eqn ( 48 ) . On the other hand , if c0 is small or negative , a deformation induced by a positive Ap is likely to result in biconcave - discoid shapes of the type known from red blood cells and their ghosts . Such shapes permit a large decrease in vesicle volume , requiring at the same time comparatively little curvature . Bilayer vesicles may possess a variety of stable and metastable states . As far as they are caused by spontaneous curvature , a magnetic field , or a pres­ sure difference , they should all be solutions of the above shape equations . It is easy to put up a general relation involving both H and Ap . The formula for the ellipticity of a weakly deformed vesicle subject to both influences comes out to be So = 2 ( ' An - Xx ) b H2 3 { Apc — Ap ) ( 50 ) D . Energies and thermal fluctuations Sometimes a comparison of energies is more ex­ pedient than a balance of forces . A vesicle whose shape is exactly an ellipsoid of revolution has the following curvature - elastic , magnetic , and volume energies in the lowest occurring power of s2 Ec = { 8n / 5 ) ( 6 — r0 c0 ) kc ( s22 / r 02 ) , ( 51 ) E h = { 16 n / 15 ) { xn - x t ) bH 2 r0s2 , ( 52 ) Ey = — ( 4 n / 5 ) Ap r0 s22 . ( 53 ) Formulas ( 51 ) and ( 52 ) have been given before6 . Their calculation is straightforward but fairly cum­ bersome . The radius r0 is that of the original sphere . As the surface area is kept constant , r0 in ( 37 ) has to be replaced by the renormalized radius ro + + 0 ( s23 ) . ( 54 ) zu r0 Renormalization has been taken into account in Eqn ( 51 ) . The volume of the renormalized ellipsoid is r = ( 4 * / 3 ) ( r03 - fr 0s22 ) + 0 ( s23 ) , ( 55 ) which leads directly to Eqn ( 53 ) . Knowing that small deformations are ellipsoidal 6 , one can use the W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers 701 energy expressions to rederive ( 42 ) , ( 48 ) , and ( 50 ) . The possible effect of thermal fluctuations of the vesicle shape on the deformation induced by pres­ sure has already been mentioned . According to ( 51 ) these fluctuations can be very strong . Their mean square amplitude is deducible from ( l / 2 ) kBT = ( E c ) ( 56 ) where kß is Boltzmann’s constant and T the absolute temperature . For k # T = 4 - 10“14 erg . A ; c = 5 - 10 ~ 13 dyn cm , and c0 = 0 , one obtains Bilayer vesicles at room temperature may thus be expected to exhibit , on the average , an appreciable ellipticity . Deformations of higher order will also be excited , so the shape can be rather bumpy . Simple statistical considerations indicate , however , that thermal deformations should not affect a super­ imposed magnetic deformation too much , unless they distort the original sphere almost beyond re­ cognition . IV . Possible Experiments A check of the proposed theory would be experi­ ments aimed at determining the curvature - elastic modulus kc and the spontaneous curvature c0 . Are measurements of the type outlined above feasible ? A . Magnetic deformation Let us first deal with the deformation caused by magnetic fields . With & c = 5 •10 - 13 erg , — Xt — 10 ~ 7 , 6 = 5 - 10 _ 7cm , H = 104 oersted , and c0 = 0 , one computes from Eqn ( 42 ) . s2 = — 5 ■ 10 _ 10 cm ( 57 ) for a vesicle of radius r0 = 10 ~ 5cm . This is a small deformation , but it may be detectable by means of the induced birefrigence of a concentrated solution of vesicles , a formula for which was already been given 6 . We have assumed / n — ^ t = 10 - 7 because this order of magnitude is characteristic of liquid crystals . The magnetic anisotropy of ordinary lipid bilayers is probably smaller . However , the order of 10 - 7 may be reached by lipids with highly un­ saturated hydrocarbon chains . Alternatively , it may be achieved with the aid of spin labels . A concentra­ tion of roughly 0 . 1 percent is needed , the bulk susceptibility of paramagnetic organic compounds being typically around 10 ~ 4 . Any deformation of a spherical vesicle diminishes its volume if the surface area is fixed . Therefore , a predicted magnetic deformation may be prevented by the hydrostatic elasticity of the enclosed water . To assess the strength of this disturbance , we write down the compressional energy Ew , assuming that without field the vesicle is spherical and Ap — 0 . On the basis of ( 55 ) we have < s8 > The elastic stiffness of water , kw , is 2 - 1010dyn cm - 2 . Ew varies as the fourth power of s 2 , unlike the curvature - elastic energy Ec given by ( 51 ) . Com­ parison shows that for c0 = 0 EW < EC if 522 < 40 ( kc / r0 kw ) . ( 59 ) For the above vesicle the energy of water compres­ sion is negligible if | s2 | < 1 • 10 - 8 cm . Clearly , the deformation ( 57 ) is well within the limit . The restriction ( 59 ) becomes more stringent for larger vesicles . It seems prohibitive for red blood cells and their ghosts whose radii are about 3 - 10 ~ 4cm . A certain relief may be provided by permeation which is discussed below . An attractive method for facilitating rapid pressure equalization would be the insertion of pores of tubes , particular­ ly with giant bilayer vesicles 2 . So far , we have neglected the strong thermal fluctuations of the vesicle shape , which , in most cases , are likely to be much stronger than the magne­ tic deformation . Since the two effects should be es­ sentially independent , as stated earlier , the fluctua­ tions do not prevent meaningful measurements of the induced birefringence . On the contrary , thermal de­ formation is an advantage whenever magnetic de­ formation is hindered by slow permeation . Provided the thermal ellipticity is much larger than the in­ duced deformation , one can view magnetic bire­ fringence primarily as a result of the orienting action of the field on preexistent ellipsoids . The ad­ ditional deformation by the magnetic field is then 702 W . Helfrich • Elastic Properties of Lipid Bilayers negligible and there is no need to wait for the end of permeation before measuring the magnetic bire­ fringence . Of course , the thermal fluctuations have to be fully developed at the time of measurement . In order to get an idea of how fast they form and decay , we consider the relaxation of ellipticity under its own force . The pressure produced by an ellip­ soidal deformation is Ap = d E { / dV ds . , 2 kc ( 6 - r o cn ) ( 60 ) dso ' uo2 ' o This is just the critical pressure A p ( . and indepen­ dent of s . 2 * With kc = 5 • 10“13 erg and c0 = 0 one has . ( 6 • 103 dyn cm - 2 for r0 = 10“5cm ^ } 0 . 2 dyn cm“2 for r0 = 3 - 10“4cm . The speed of permeation may be expressed by the time derivative of the vesicle volume , dV / dt = ( P M / q a ) Ap 4 n r02 . ( 62 ) Here P is the permeability , M the molecular weight and Q the density of the permeating substance . The ratio a is at room temperature 2 . 24 ■ 1010 dyn cm“2 per mole cm“3 . A useful quantity is dV / 4 n r .

With these values , in particular P = 10“4 cm sec“1 , one computes for the inverse of the right - hand side of ( 63 ) 5 104 sec for r0 = 10“5cm , 5 - 1010sec for rft = 3 - 10 4 cm . ( 64 ) These times multiplied by ( s22 ) / r02 should be characteristic of the build - up and decay of thermal shape fluctuations . With { so2 ) / r02 äs 10“3 , the ear­ lier estimate , the relaxation is fairly fast for r0 = 10“3cm , but unacceptably slow for r = 3 1 0 “4cm . However , the very slow permeation of dissolved ions 9 may prevent the establishment of equilibrium in either case . B . Deformation by pressure Experimental studies of the deformation caused by pressure differences zlp > 0 appear to be difficult because of the expected smallness of the critical pressure , as illustrated by ( 61 ) . For large vesicles such as red blood cells , the theoretical critical pres­ sure is so small that under osmosis the vesicle vo­ lume should be simply determined by the relation V j r03 = cjc . d . ( 65 ) Here c ; and ca are the initial and actual concentra­ tions of a single nonpermeating solute and it is as­ sumed that from the start the concentration is the same inside and outside the vesicle . The vesicle shape is controlled by curvature elasticity , together with the auxiliary conditions of fixed surface area and volume . Practical experience9 and estimates like those above indicate that even with red blood cells the permeation of water takes no more than a few minutes under the force of osmosis . The critical pressure of small vesicles , r0 < 10“5 cm , is of a more accessible order . However , since the decrease of the vesicle volume by the permeation of water increases the internal solute concentration , Ap is diminished and the deformation stopped be - for reaching the shape to be expected with a con­ stant Ap . A sufficiently sensitive method of detec­ tion may still reveal the threshold pressure of de­ formation . Both the intensity and spectrum of scat­ tered light could show the onset of the deformation . Another possibility would be to measure the magne­ tic birefringence of a vesicle solution . An ellipticity caused by pressure should manifest itself by a dramatic increase of the birefringence . V . Concluding Remarks Our discussion of bilayer elasticity and vesicle shapes leaves many open questions , some of which can be answered only by experiment . Of particular interest is the strength of the thermal fluctuations . Where they are very pronounced , curvature elastici­ ty becomes ineffective in controlling the shape of vesicles . The fact that visible vesicles , e . g . bicon­ cave - discoid red blood cells , seem to have a constant shape is evidence to the contrary . However , the elastic stiffness of vesicles may vary over a wide range and can be influenced by chemical means , notably through c0 . Another interesting problem is the role of the elastic properties in vesicle fusion and fission . Although in biological systems these processes are probably catalyzed by proteins , it is conceivable that certain elastic conditions must be met to make them possible . W .
