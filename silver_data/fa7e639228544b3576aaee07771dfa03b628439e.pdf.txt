Therefore , altered expression of adhesion molecules leads to the development of various tissue disorders involving cell activation , degeneration , and apoptosis . Nevertheless , it still remains unclear what initiates the altered expression of adhesion molecules and how the subsequent pathological cascades proceed . In this regard , cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CADM1 ) is one of the candidates that is involved in the development of pathological lesions ; it is an intercellular adhesion molecule that is expressed in various types of cells such as pulmonary cells , neurons , and mast cells . Recent studies have revealed that alterations in the transcriptional or post - transcriptional expressions of CADM1 correlate with the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases and allergic diseases . In this review , we speciﬁcally focus on how CADM1 is involved in the development of pathological lesions in pulmonary emphysema and atopic dermatitis . Keywords : degeneration , apoptosis , protease imbalance , ectodomain shedding , neuro - immune interaction FUNCTION OF CADM1 UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS In the last two or three decades , a line of studies have revealed the molecular basis of cell adhesion to neighboring cells and surrounding extracellular matrices in our body . That is , cell adhesion is of crucial importance in human body homeostasis ( Macara et al . , 2014 ) . Dedicated proteins directly mediating cell adhesion have been revealed such as cadherins , integrins , selectins , and immunoglobulin superfamily members ; they are now called “adhesion molecules” ( Coombe and Dye , 2010 ) . In particular , accumulating data demonstrate the importance of cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CADM1 ) , which is an intercellular adhesion molecule that belongs to the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) superfamily ( Kuramochi et al . , 2001 ) . CADM1 comprises three major functional domains : an extracellular Ig - like domain , a single transmembrane region , and a short carboxy - terminal intracytoplasmic tail that is further composed of a protein 4 . 1 - binding motif and a PDZ type II domain - binding motif ( Kuramochi et al . , 2001 ) . Historically , CADM1 has had several nomenclatures such as spermatogenic immunoglobulin superfamily ( SgIGSF ) , tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 ( TSLC1 ) , nectin - like molecule 2 ( Necl2 ) , and synaptic cell adhesion molecule ( SynCAM ) , based on its diverse functional nature in various cell lineages such as spermatogonia , lung epithelial cells , and neurons ( Watabe et al . , 2003 ) . We have previously demonstrated that CADM1 is expressed in mast cells ( Ito et al . , 2003 ) , biliary cells ( Ito et al . , 2007 ) , pancreatic endocrine cells ( Koma et al . , 2008 ) , and osteoblasts ( Inoue et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , CADM1 has been shown to have several splicing isoforms ; these isoforms expressed on the cell surface are Yoneshige et al . Pathogenic Actions of CADM1 named SP1 to SP4 based on the diﬀerence in the length of the juxtamembranous extracellular region ( Biederer , 2006 ) . Lung epithelial cells and mast cells exclusively express the SP4 isoform whereas neurons express various combinations of these four isoforms ( Ito et al . , 2003 ; Sakurai - Yageta et al . , 2009 ; Hagiyama et al . , 2011 ) . In epithelia , CADM1 is located on the lateral cell membrane and mediates neighboring cell adhesion via trans - homophilic interaction ( Koma et al . , 2008 ; Ito et al . , 2012 ) . CADM1 directly interacts with a spectrin - actin - binding protein DAL1 through the intracytoplasmic protein 4 . 1 - binding motif to promote the formation of epithelial cell morphology ( Yageta et al . , 2002 ; Sakurai - Yageta et al . , 2009 ) . CADM1 also interacts with a membrane - associated guanylate kinase PALS2 through the PDZ type II domain - binding motif ; this interaction controls epithelial cell polarity ( Shingai et al . , 2003 ; Wu et al . , 2007 ) . In mast cells , CADM1 mediates their adhesion to ﬁbroblasts ( Ito et al . , 2003 ) , airway smooth muscle cells ( Moiseeva et al . , 2013 ) , and neurons ( Furuno et al . , 2005 ) . In particular , CADM1 plays a central role in the direct cell - to - cell contact between mast cells and unmyelinated C - ﬁbers of sensory neurons through trans - homophilical interaction to promote neurno - immune interaction between them ( Furuno et al . , 2005 ) . PATHOGENIC ACTIONS OF CADM1 IN PULMONARY EMPHYSEMA Pathologically , the adhesion molecules is involved in the development and progression of diseases and disorders such as tumors ( Demetriou and Cress , 2004 ) , inﬂammatory diseases ( Macauley et al . , 2014 ) , and neurological diseases ( Berezin et al . , 2014 ) . Then , how can they be pathogenic without genetic mutations ? One of possible mechanisms is their susceptibility to proteolysis . Since the adhesion molecules are expressed on the cell membrane , they often undergo extra - and inter - membraneous enzymatic cleavage ; this phenomenon is termed “ectodomain shedding” ( Edwards et al . , 2008 ) . CADM1 is shed at the extracellular domain by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 ( ADAM10 ) protease to produce a membrane - bound α C - terminal fragment ( α CTF ) ; CADM1 is also shed by yet unidentiﬁed proteases to produce β CTF ( Nagara et al . , 2012 ; Mimae et al . , 2014 ) . Tobacco smoking is known to induce an imbalanced increase in protease activity within lung alveoli ( Taraseviciene - Stewart and Voelkel , 2008 ) . As a consequence , lung epithelial CADM1 is shed in smokers’ lungs at high levels to produce a substantial amount of α CTF and β CTF . Then , α CTF enters into the lung epithelial cytoplasm , accumulates in mitochondria , and depolarizes the mitochondrial outer membrane potential ; this process results in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway ( Mimae et al . , 2014 ) . Because the full - length CADM1 plays an important role in the maintenance of epithelial polarity ( Sakurai - Yageta et al . , 2009 ) , an increase in CADM1 shedding with an accompanying decrease in the full - length CADM1 induces the disruption of alveolar cell polarity and the cell apoptosis ( Yoneshige et al . , 2015 ) . There is the third CADM1 shedding event ; the truncated products α CTF and β CTF can be further cleaved within its transmembrane region by γ - secretase to produce free fragments of the intracellular domain ( ICD ; Nagara et al . , 2012 ) . In a similar fashion to α CTF , ICD moves into mitochondria and induces apoptosis of lung epithelial cells ( Hagiyama et al . , 2015 ) . Through these events , CADM1 is involved in the development and progression of pulmonary emphysema , a smoking - related lung degenerative disease characterized by the peripheral airspace enlargement associated with increased apoptosis of alveolar cells ( Mimae et al . , 2014 ; Figure 1 ) . Similarly , CADM1 - mediated pathological mechanisms have been proven in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia by inducing the apoptosis of type 2 alveolar cells ( Yoneshige et al . , 2015 ) and type 2 diabetic pancreas by inducing the apoptosis of insulin - secreting islet β cells ( Inoue et al . , 2014 ) . PATHOGENIC ACTIONS OF CADM1 IN ATOPIC DERMATITIS We have also demonstrated pathological roles of CADM1 in atopic dermatitis ( Hagiyama et al . , 2013 ) . It has long been known FIGURE 1 | Increased ectodomain shedding of CADM1 as a cause of epithelial cell apoptosis . In epithelia , CADM1 is located on the lateral cell membrane and mediates neighboring cell adhesion via trans - homophilic binding . Under pathological conditions , ectodomain shedding of CADM1 is induced through an imbalanced increase in protease activity such as neutrophil elastases , macrophage matrix metalloproteinases , and / or the inactivation of anti - protease α 1 - antitrypsin . CADM1 is shed at the extracellular domain by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 ( ADAM10 ) protease to produce a membrane - bound α C - terminal fragment ( α CTF ) . Then , the truncated product α CTF enters into cytoplasm , accumulates in mitochondria , and depolarizes the mitochondrial outer membrane potential ; this process results in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway . α CTF can be further cleaved within its transmembrane region by γ - secretase to produce free fragments of the intracellular domain ( ICD ) . In similar to α CTF , ICD moves into mitochondria and induces apoptosis of lung epithelial cells . An increase in CADM1 shedding with an accompanying decrease in the full - length CADM1 induces the disruption of alveolar cell polarity and the cell apoptosis .

Pathogenic Actions of CADM1 FIGURE 2 | CADM1 - mediated nerve – mast cell interaction in the atopic dermatitis skin lesion . Dermal mast cells are observed in contact with nerve ﬁbers in the atopic dermatitis . These lesional mast cells express CADM1 at higher levels than those in the normal skin , which is induced by the basic helix - loop - helix type microphthalmia - transcription factor ( MITF ) . CADM1 - expressing mast cells interact with neurons to secrete substance P ( SP ) , and the neuron - derived substance P further interacts with the cognate receptor neurokinin 1 ( NK - 1 ) expressed on the mast cells to induce their degranulation . that pathological cell adhesion is observed between nerve ﬁbers and mast cells in atopic dermatitis lesions ( Jarvikallio et al . , 2003 ) . Here , mast cells are immune cells featured by cytoplasmic granules containing various bioactive molecules . Their unique characteristics is that , unlike other immune cells , they exist in the digestive and respiratory mucosa and skin dermis at a certain cell density under healthy conditions ( Kitamura et al . , 2007 ) . Under pathological conditions , however , the number of mast cells is increased through the proliferation of tissue - resident mast cells and also the recruitment from circulating myeloid progenitor cells ( Jung and Scholz , 2008 ) . In a mouse model of hapten - induced atopic dermatitis , dermal mast cells were observed in contact with nerve ﬁbers at high frequencies ( Shiohara et al . , 2004 ) . Our laser capture microdissection - based RT - qPCT analyses revealed that the lesional mast cells expressed CADM1 mRNA at approximately ﬁve - fold higher levels than those in the normal skin ( Hagiyama et al . , 2013 ) . This altered CADM1 expression appears to be induced by the basic helix - loop - helix type microphthalmia - transcription factor ( MITF ) , a key factor for mast cell diﬀerentiation ( Ito et al . , 2003 ) . When neurons and mast cells are co - cultured , the kinetic strength ( force - induced dissociation rate ) of mast cell adhesion to nerve ﬁbers varies dependently on the expression levels of CADM1 on mast cells ( Hagiyama et al . , 2013 ) . We have previously shown that the CADM1 - expressing mast cells interact with neurons to secrete substance P and that such neuron - derived substance P further interacts with the cognate receptor neurokinin that is 1 expressed on the mast cells to induce their degranulation ( Furuno et al . , 2004 , 2005 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that neuron - mast cell adhesion ( so called “neuro - immune interaction” ) might be strengthened in atopic dermatitis through an increased expression of CADM1 in mast cells . This mechanism is recently highlighted as a molecular basis that can explain why mental stress exacerbates atopic dermatitis ( Figure 2 ) . CONCLUDING REMARKS As reviewed here , CADM1 is involved in the development of pulmonary emphysema through its ectodomain shedding in lung epithelial cells by promoting the apoptosis of lung epithelial cells . Since apoptotic cell death is frequently observed in various degenerative diseases , future studies may identify the protease - mediated shedding of adhesion molecules as a common cause for tissue degeneration . Furthermore , an increased expression of CADM1 is involved in the development of atopic dermatitis by promoting the neuro - immune interaction . Recent advances in biological experimental techniques and future studies may identify this lesion - speciﬁc cell adhesion as a major cause of various inﬂammatory diseases .
