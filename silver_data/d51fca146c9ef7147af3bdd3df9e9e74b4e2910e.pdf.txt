By production of superoxide as one type of reactive oxygen species 46 ( ROS ) , they exert pleiotropic functions in plant development and various stress responses . 47 Arabidopsis thaliana RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG PROTEIN C / ROOT 48 HAIR DEFECTIVE 2 ( AtRBOHC / RHD2 ) is an NADPH oxidase with preferential gene 49 expression in roots . Polar localisation and ROS production by this enzyme are essential for 50 root hair elongation . However , the proteome - wide and physiological consequences of 51 RBOHC / RHD2 mutations are unknown . To find out potential new functions of 52 AtRBOHC / RHD2 , we employed a differential proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis rhd2 - 1 53 mutant , carrying a loss - of - function mutation in RBOHC / RHD2 . Proteomic analyses that were 54 validated with independent biochemical , phenotypical and advanced microscopy methods , 55 showed quantitative deregulation of proteins involved in abiotic and biotic stress response , 56 metabolism , vesicular transport and cell wall modification . Considerable differences in the 57 differential proteomes between roots and above - ground parts were found in the mutant . The 58 altered abundance of aquaporins and homeostasis of transmembrane pumps and transporters 59 most likely determine the higher sensitivity of Arabidopsis rhd2 - 1 mutant to drought . 60 Keywords : actin , aquaporins , Arabidopsis , microtubules , NADPH oxidase , PIP1 , plasma 61 membrane , proteomics , RBOHC 62 Introduction 63 NADPH oxidases , encoded in plants by RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG 64 ( RBOH ) genes , are plasma membrane ( PM ) localised proteins with pleiotropic functions in 65 plant development and stress response . Ten RBOH isoforms have been identified in 66 Arabidopsis ( AtRBOHA to AtRBOHJ ) with differing tissue - dependent and conditional 67 expressions ( Kaur and Pati , 2018 ; Chapman et al . , 2019 ) . Catalytic activity of NADPH 68 3 oxidases leads to the formation of superoxide anion in the apoplast by transferring electrons 69 from NAD ( P ) H to molecular oxygen . Under environmental stimuli , NADPH oxidases are 70 activated by phosphorylation and Ca 2 + , leading to localised superoxide production . After the 71 enzymatic or nonenzymatic conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide , this is 72 transported to intracellular space to convey the external signals ( Chapman et al . , 2019 ) . To 73 reveal a mode of RBOH regulation , it was shown that ROS production is also affected by 74 Rho - of - Plant ( ROP ) GTPases . One of them , ROP6 , is responsible for the formation of 75 nanodomains under osmotic stress , where it recruits , interacts with , and activates RBOHD 76 ( Smokvarska et al . , 2020 ) . This RBOHD isoform undergoes nanodomain - associated 77 endocytosis during salt stress ( Hao et al . , 2014 ) . 78 Arabidopsis RBOHC / RHD2 ( RHD2 stands for ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 2 ) represents an 79 isoform preferentially expressed in roots and root hairs ( Foreman et al . , 2003 ) . Root hair 80 elongation is preconditioned by the polar accumulation of ROS produced by RBOHC and it 81 cannot be replaced by RBOHJ or RBOHH ( Kaya et al . , 2019 ) . Advanced quantitative 82 microscopy revealed that GFP - RBOHC / RHD2 is delivered to the apical PM domain of the 83 root hair by trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) in a structural sterol - dependent manner ( Kub ě nová et 84 al . , 2022 ) . ROS production by RBOHC in root hairs depends on ROP2 ( Jones et al . , 2007 ) 85 and SUPERCENTIPEDE ( SCN1 ) , a Rho GTPase GDP dissociaton inhibitor ( Carol et al . , 86 2005 ; Arenas - Alfonseca et al . , 2018 ) . Transcriptional regulation of RBOHC expression 87 controlled by transcription factor RSL4 is essential for the root hair growth - promoting effect 88 of auxin ( Mangano et al . , 2018 ) . RBOHC is activated by CIPK26 - mediated phosphorylation , 89 but CIPK itself is unnecessary for root hair formation ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Moreover , the 90 expression of RBOHC is stimulated by ethylene and is responsible for ROS production and 91 root hair formation in response to ethylene ( Martin et al . , 2022 ) . 92 Loss - of - function root hair defective 2 ( rhd2 ) mutants exert short , non - growing root hairs with 93 missing tip - focused ROS and Ca 2 + gradients ( Schiefelbein and Somerville , 1990 ; Foreman et 94 al . , 2003 ) and this phenotype might be reversed by external addition of ROS or pH 95 alkalinisation ( Monshausen et al . , 2007 ) . The mutant also shows altered dynamics of early 96 endosomes , while late endosomes appear unaffected ( Kub ě nová et al . , 2022 ) . 97 Although the mechanisms underlying defective root hair elongation in rhd2 - 1 mutant are well 98 known , physiological consequences at the level of shoots and whole plants have not been 99 studied so far . Processes occurring downstream of altered ROS production and signalling in 100 the rhd2 - 1 mutant could be reflected by proteome composition of roots and shoots . To answer 101 4 these questions , we performed a differential proteomic analysis on roots and shoots of rhd2 - 1 102 mutant . Based on independent validations of differentially regulated proteins , we suggest that 103 the loss of RBOHC function is associated with altered homeostasis of PM localised proteins , 104 including aquaporin PIP1 isoform . This was accompanied by compromised drought stress 105 tolerance in rhd2 - 1 mutant . 106 107 Material and Methods 108 Plant Material and Growth Conditions 109 Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana , ecotype Col - 0 , as a wild - type , rhd2 - 1 , a loss - of - function 110 mutant ( Foreman et al . , 2003 ) , as well as transgenic Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 plants bearing 111 35S : : mRFP : TUB6 ( mRFP - TUB6 ) construct ( Fujita et al . 2011 ) , as well as transgenic Col - 0 112 and rhd2 - 1 plants carrying 35S : : GFP : FABD2 ( GFP - FABD2 ) were used in this study . To 113 prepare the rhd2 - 1 transgenic lines with mRFP - TUB6 or GFP - FABD2 , the rhd2 - 1 mutant 114 was crossed as a female donor with a Col - 0 mRFP - TUB6 line or Col - 0 GFP - FABD2 as male 115 donors . For proteomic analysis and immunoblotting , seeds were ethanol - sterilised and grown 116 for 14 days on ½ Murashige and Skoog ( ½ MS ) media at 21°C , 70 % humidity , and 16 - h / 8 - h 117 light / dark cycle . The illumination intensity was 130 µmol m – 2 . s – 1 . Roots and above - ground 118 parts were harvested . The samples were harvested 6 - 8h after initiation of light illumination . 119 Three days - old seedlings were used for live - cell imaging and whole - mount 120 immunolocalization . To test the response of plants to drought stress , seeds were placed to 121 substrate in the pots and the plants were grown for 4 weeks under the conditions mentioned 122 above . 123 Proteomic Analysis 124 Peptide digests were prepared as described previously ( Taká č et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , the 125 harvested biological material was grounded to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen , and the 126 proteins were extracted by phenol extraction and methanol precipitation . Proteins were 127 digested in solution by sequencing - grade modified trypsin . Proteins identification , data 128 filtering , quantification and statistical evaluation were performed as described in Melicher et 129 al . ( 2022 ) . The LC - ESI - MS / MS analysis was performed on a nanoflow HPLC system ( Easy - 130 nLC1200 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer 131 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Bremen , Germany ) equipped with a nano - electrospray ionisation 132 5 source . Peptides were first loaded onto a trapping column and subsequently separated on a 15 133 cm C18 column ( 75 μ m × 15 cm , ReproSil - Pur 5 μ m 200 Å C18 - AQ , Dr . Maisch HPLC 134 GmbH , Ammerbuch - Entringen , Germany ) . The mobile phase consisted of water with 0 . 1 % 135 formic acid ( solvent A ) and acetonitrile / water ( 80 : 20 ( v / v ) ) with 0 . 1 % formic acid ( solvent 136 B ) . Peptides were eluted with a linear 110 min gradient from 5 % to 21 % solvent B in 62 min 137 and then to 36 % solvent B in 110 min , followed by a wash stage with 100 % solvent B . MS 138 data were acquired automatically using Thermo Xcalibur 4 . 1 . software ( Thermo Fisher 139 Scientific ) . An information - dependent acquisition method consisted of an Orbitrap MS survey 140 scan with a mass range of 300 – 1750 m / z followed by HCD fragmentation for the most intense 141 peptide ions . 142 Data files were searched for protein identification using Proteome Discoverer 2 . 3 software 143 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) connected to an in - house server running the Mascot 2 . 7 . 0 software 144 ( Matrix Science ) . Data were searched against the SwissProt database ( version 2019 _ 11 ) using 145 the A . thaliana taxonomy filter . The following parameters were used : static modifications : 146 carbamidomethyl ( C ) * , variable modifications : oxidation ( M ) , acetyl ( protein N - term ) , 147 peptide mass tolerance : ± 10 ppm , fragment mass tolerance : ± 0 . 02 Da , maximum missed 148 cleavages : 2 , FDR = 0 . 01 . Methionine oxidation is a common modification during sample 149 processing and is generally included in the search parameters . Only unique peptides were 150 used for the protein level quantifications . Abundance values for peptides and proteins were 151 calculated based on the intensities of peptide precursor ions . All peptides were used for 152 normalisation . T - test ( background based ) was used as a quantification hypothesis test . 153 Minimum two replicates in one sample group had to contain the same quantification feature in 154 order to be included into the quantification . Proteomics analyses were carried out with three 155 biological replicates for each of the four biological samples ( roots and aerial parts of Col - 0 156 and rhd2 - 1 , respectively ) . Each replicate contained at least 30 seedlings . All peptides were 157 used for normalisation . ANOVA ( adjusted p ≤ 0 . 05 ) was used to filter statistically significant 158 results , applied to proteins exhibiting a fold change ≥ 1 . 5 . Proteins identified by one peptide 159 were excluded from the analysis . Proteins present in all three replicates corresponding to the 160 control proteome and absent in all three replicates of the test proteome were considered 161 unique for the control proteome and vice versa . 162 Bioinformatics analysis of the differential proteome 163 The differential proteome was evaluated using GO Term Enrichment tool on 164 https : / / www . arabidopsis . org / tools / go _ term _ enrichment . jsp . Protein localisation was predicted 165 6 using WoLF PSORT ( https : / / wolfpsort . hgc . jp / ) . For analysis of protein interaction networks 166 representation in differential proteome , STRING ( Szklarczyk et al . , 2019 ) web - based 167 application was used considering experimental evidences and co - expression while the 168 minimum required interaction score was set to 0 . 7 ( relevant for high confidence prediction ) . 169 Immunoblotting Analysis 170 Protein extraction and immunoblotting analysis were performed as described previously 171 ( Melicher et al . , 2022 ) . To detect abundances of PIPs and CHC , anti - PIP1 . 1 - 5 ( AS09 487 ) 172 and anti - CHC antibodies ( AS10 690 ; all from Agrisera , Sweden ) were used , respectively . 173 Band densities were quantified using Image Lab software ( Bio - Rad ) . Three biological 174 replicates were carried out in this analysis and differences between the Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 175 mutant were evaluated by one - way ANOVA analysis with post hoc Tukey HSD test . To test 176 the loading of equal amount of proteins , proteins were visualised on membranes using 177 Ponceau - S staining . 178 Whole Mount Immunolocalization 179 Three days - old seedlings of Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 were used for immunolocalization of PIP1 in 180 roots as described previously ( Šamajová et al . , 2014 ) . In the case of leaf immunolabeling , we 181 used leaves of 10 days - old Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 plants and followed the protocol by Pasternak et 182 al . ( 2015 ) . Samples were immunolabeled with anti - PIP1 . 1 - 5 rabbit polyclonal primary 183 antibody ( Agrisera , Sweden ) diluted 1 : 150 in 3 % ( w / v ) BSA in PBS at 4°C overnight . Then , 184 AlexaFluor 647 goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Abcam ) diluted 1 : 500 in 2 . 5 % ( w / v ) 185 BSA in PBS was used for 2 h incubation at 37°C . Microscopic analysis of immunolabeled 186 samples was performed with a Zeiss 880 LSM Airyscan equipped with 32 GaAsP detector 187 ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) using a Plan - Apochromat 63× / 1 . 4 Oil DIC M27 objective and 188 fluorophore excitation with 631 nm laser . The image acquisition , post - processing and 189 fluorescence intensity measurement were made using Zeiss ZEN software ( Black and Blue 190 versions , Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . Semiquantitative evaluation of immunolabeled PIP1 was 191 performed using fluorescence intensity profile measurement of PIP1 spot - like structures 192 localised at the PM of root and leaf epidermal cells . Data were obtained from root and leaf 193 epidermal cells ( 40 cells per root ; 15 cells per leaf ) from 3 individual plants of Col - 0 and 194 rhd2 - 1 mutant . Statistical significance was evaluated using t - test ( * * p < 0 . 01 ) . 195 Drought stress 196 7 Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 plants grown in pots for 4 weeks as described above , were subjected to 197 drought stress by withholding the irrigation , while in controls , plants were continuously 198 irrigated . Following 18 days , plants were documented using a Nikon 5000 SLR camera . 199 200 In vivo observation of microtubules and actin using lattice light - sheet fluorescence 201 microscopy 202 The study of cortical microtubules in transgenic Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 lines carrying mRFP - 203 TUBULIN β 6 fluorescent marker ( Col - 0 mRFP - TUB6 and rhd2 - 1 mRFP - TUB6 , 204 respectively ) in root cells was performed by lattice light - sheet fluorescence microscopy 205 ( lattice LSFM , Chen et al . , 2014 ) . High - resolution single - side illumination and single - side 206 detection lattice LSFM system was equipped with illumination objective 28 . 5× / 0 . 62 NA , 207 detection objective 25× / 1 . 1 NA , and Orca Flash 4 . 0 sCMOS camera . Exposure time for image 208 acquisition was 100 ms . Fluorescence of mRFP was excited at 589 nm . Images were acquired 209 at 1 s intervals for 60 time points at Z - stack mode containing 20 optical sections with the step 210 size of 0 . 25 μ m . The Richardson - Lucy algorithm was used for deconvolution . Images are 211 presented as orthogonal projections of individual planes . 212 Orientation of cortical microtubules in root epidermal cells of Col - 0 mRFP - TUB6 and rhd2 - 1 213 mRFP - TUB6 plants , with respect to the orientation of root longitudinal axis , was analysed 214 using the OrientationJ plugin in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ; http : / / sites . imagej . net / BIG - 215 EPFL / ) . Mean values of microtubule orientation , their analysis and comparisons between lines 216 over time of recordings were evaluated , and the Python programming language with 217 Anaconda Navigator program , version 2 . 1 . 4 ( Anaconda , Inc . ) was used for data graphical 218 presentation . The values with a low coherence ( 0 . 02 and below ) were excluded from the 219 analysis . Graphical presentations of cortical microtubule distribution were prepared in 220 Microsoft Excel . 221 Lattice LSFM data processing using PIV analyser 222 Velocity of actin filaments in epidermal root cells of Col - 0 GFP - FABD2 and rhd2 - 1 GFP - 223 FABD2 transformed plants was analysed using the PIV analyser plugin in Fiji 224 ( https : / / imagej . net / plugins / piv - analyser ) . Mean values of actin velocities , their analysis , and 225 comparisons between lines over time of recordings were evaluated , and a Python 226 8 programming language with Anaconda Navigator program , version 2 . 1 . 4 ( Anaconda , Inc . ) 227 was used for data graphical presentation . 228 229 Results 230 The proteome of Arabidopsis rhd2 - 1 mutant substantially differs from the Col - 0 231 Altogether , 121 and 108 differentially regulated proteins were found in rhd2 - 1 roots and 232 above - ground parts , respectively , compared to the Col - 0 ( Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ) . 233 Gene ontology ( GO ) annotation analysis of the differential proteome showed that the highest 234 number of differentially regulated proteins is involved in metabolism , response to abiotic and 235 biotic stimulus , development , gene expression and translation . The rhd2 - 1 also differed from 236 the Col - 0 in proteins involved in photosynthesis , intracellular transport , response to 237 hormones , lipid , and cell wall modification ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . The annotations such 238 as metabolism , gene expression ( roots ) , translation ( both samples ) , starch metabolic process 239 ( above - ground parts ) and response to gravity ( roots ) were enriched in differential proteomes , 240 as evaluated by Fisher ' s exact test ( Supplementary Figures S1 , S2 ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . 241 Proteins involved in translation formed the biggest protein interaction cluster in the 242 differential proteomes ( Figure 1 ) . Most differentially regulated proteins localise to the 243 cytoplasm , nuclei , plastids , vacuoles , PM , cell cortex , ribosome , plasmodesmata , cell 244 junctions , symplast and vesicles . Annotations such as ribosome , vacuolar membrane , vacuole , 245 plasmodesma , nucleolus , cell wall , cytosol and cytoplasmic vesicle were enriched in the 246 differential proteomes ( Supplementary Figures S3 , S4 ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . 247 Remarkably , differential proteomes of roots differed from above - ground parts mainly in 248 defence - related proteins , glutathione S - transferases ( GSTs ) , cell wall regulatory proteins and 249 secreted proteins ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . In roots of rhd2 - 1 compared to Col - 0 , all 250 defence - related proteins had a higher abundance , while in above - ground parts , they mainly 251 showed a lower abundance . Also , secreted proteins and proteins involved in cell wall 252 modification were much more affected in roots compared to above - ground parts . 253 In order to estimate which of the differentially regulated proteins contribute to the root hair 254 phenotype of the mutant , we used the ePlant gene expression database ( Fucile et al . , 2011 ) to 255 screen the genes encoding the differentially regulated proteins expressed in trichoblast cells , 256 or in the root differentiation zone . Proteins involved in membrane trafficking and metabolism 257 9 had root hair - , or root differential zone - specific expression patterns ( Table 1 ) . Remarkably , 258 the majority of membrane trafficking proteins showed lower abundance in the rhd2 - 1 mutant 259 proteome , implying that these might contribute to its root hair phenotype . Other proteins 260 included PEROXIDASE 27 , CRYPTOCHROME DASH , a protein involved in vacuolar 261 transport MONOSACCHARIDE - SENSING PROTEIN 1 and proteins involved in signalling 262 ( CSC1 - LIKE PROTEIN ERD4 , PHOSPHOINOSITIDE PHOSPHATASE SAC8 ; Table 1 ) . 263 Deregulation of stress - related proteins in the rhd2 - 1 mutant 264 Differences accounted between the rhd2 - 1 and Col - 0 occurred in proteins involved in plant 265 responses to drought , high temperature , xenobiotics and biotic stress . The rhd2 - 1 mutant 266 showed downregulation of aquaporins PIP1 - 1 in roots , while PIP1 - 3 was upregulated in 267 above - ground parts ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Immunoblotting analysis using a primary 268 antibody recognising five PIP1 isoforms ( PIP1 - 1 to PIP1 - 5 ) validated the proteomic analysis , 269 showing that protein abundance corresponding to PIP1 isoforms was lower in the rhd2 - 1 270 roots , but higher in the above - ground plant parts ( Figure 2A - D ) . These results were further 271 corroborated by immunolabeling of rhd2 - 1 and Col - 0 roots and leaves using the above - 272 mentioned antibody ( Figure 2E - H ) . Semiquantitative fluorescence intensity profile 273 measurement of spot - like structures of PIP1 isoforms localised in the PM of rhd2 - 1 root 274 epidermal cells showed decreased intensities compared to Col - 0 ( Figure 2E - F ) . However , 275 increased fluorescence intensity of PIP1 isoforms localised in the PM was observed in leaf 276 epidermal cells of the rhd2 - 1 mutant ( Figure 2G - H ) . These results are consistent with 277 proteomic and immunoblotting analyses . The differential abundance of a water channel 278 aquaporins may indicate the altered response of the rhd2 - 1 mutant to drought stress . In 279 addition , other 30 differentially abundant proteins ( 15 in roots and 15 in above - ground parts ) , 280 encoded by genes showing increased expression in response to drought ( ePlant ) , were 281 downregulated in rhd2 - 1 mutant ( Figure 3 ) . These include proteins involved mainly in abiotic 282 stress response , membrane trafficking , metabolism , signalling and transmembrane transport . 283 All these data might point to altered drought stress tolerance of rhd2 - 1 mutant . To test this 284 hypothesis , we examined the drought stress tolerance of Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 plants growing in 285 soil by withholding their irrigation . This analysis revealed a higher susceptibility of rhd2 - 1 286 compared to Col - 0 ( Figure 4 ) . 287 The rhd2 - 1 mutant also showed prevalently lower abundances of proteins involved in heat 288 stress response , including HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR C - 1 , HSP90 - 3 and 289 10 HEAT SHOCK FACTOR - BINDING PROTEIN . On the other hand , heat shock 70 kDa 290 protein BIP1 showed higher abundance in rhd2 - 1 roots ( Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ) . 291 GLUTATHIONE S - TRANSFERASES ( GSTs ) are responsible for conjugating diverse 292 xenobiotics to glutathione . The differential proteome of rhd2 - 1 contained seven isoforms of 293 GSTs , including GSTU5 ( roots ) , GSTU22 ( both plant parts ) , GSTU25 ( roots ) , GSTL1 ( roots ) , 294 GSTF2 ( above - ground parts ) , GSTF6 ( both plant parts ) and GSTF7 ( above - ground parts ; 295 Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ) . While all isoforms found in roots had considerably 296 increased abundance in the rhd2 - 1 mutant , three out of four isoforms were downregulated in 297 above - ground parts ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Glutathione - xenobiotics complexes are 298 transported to the vacuole by ABC transporters ( Chronopoulou et al . , 2017 ) . Two candidates 299 for these transporters were found in our proteomic screens . ABC TRANSPORTER C 300 FAMILY MEMBER 4 showed downregulation in rhd2 - 1 roots , while ABC TRANSPORTER 301 G FAMILY MEMBER 32 was upregulated in the above - ground parts ( Supplementary Figure 302 S5 ) . 303 Furthermore , RHD2 functional mutation leads to changes in the abundance of proteins 304 involved in biotic stress response . Two important proteins involved in the perception of 305 pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , serine / threonine - protein kinase BSK1 and 306 MIK2 receptor kinase were upregulated in rhd2 - 1 roots . Some other proteins , although not 307 being a part of PAMP signalling but known to be involved in plant defense response , were 308 also upregulated ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . On the other hand , similar defense - related 309 proteins were downregulated in above - ground parts of rhd2 - 1 mutant ( Supplementary Figure 310 S5 ) . 311 Proteins involved in antioxidant defense and redox regulation are also deregulated in the 312 rhd2 - 1 mutant . Two THIOREDOXIN isoforms and one GLUTAREDOXIN were 313 downregulated , but proteins involved in the synthesis of nonenzymatic antioxidants were 314 upregulated in above - ground parts of rhd2 - 1 . Roots of rhd2 - 1 exhibited an increased 315 abundance of enzymatic antioxidants , such as Cu Zn SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE 1 ( CSD1 ) 316 and MONODEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE 3 ( MDHAR3 ) , however , a thylakoid 317 ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE ( tAPX ) was downregulated ( Supplementary Tables S1 and 318 S2 ) . 319 RHD2 mutation leads to altered homeostasis of plasma membrane , tonoplast , vesicular 320 trafficking and cytoskeletal proteins 321 11 As annotated by Uniprot , the differential proteome of rhd2 - 1 mutant contained twelve 322 proteins localised in the PM and four in the tonoplast . Proteome of rhd2 - 1 differed in the 323 abundance of PM localised proton - , cutin - and multidrug - transporting proteins and two 324 aquaporin isoforms PIP1 - 1 and PIP1 - 3 ( mentioned above ) , localised in the PM . Moreover , 325 proteins involved in Casparian strip and cellulose microfibril formation , intercellular 326 movement across plasmodesmata and perception of microbe - associated molecular patterns 327 ( MAMPs ) showed differential abundance between the mutant and Col - 0 ( Figure 5 ) . 328 Pumps transporting protons across tonoplast , such as PYROPHOSPHATE - ENERGIZED 329 VACUOLAR MEMBRANE PROTON PUMP 1 , and two subunits of V - TYPE PROTON 330 ATPase ( G1 and G2 ) were downregulated in the rhd2 - 1 mutant . MONOSACCHARIDE - 331 SENSING PROTEIN 1 , a protein transporting monosaccharides to the vacuole , was also 332 downregulated . TONOPLAST SLOCALISED HEVEIN - LIKE PREPROTEIN , a 333 pathogenesis - related protein , was also affected ( Figure 5 ) . 334 A considerable number of proteins is predicted to be secreted to the extracellular space . They 335 include cell wall constituents , proteins involved in cell wall modification , proteases and 336 lectins . Notably , cell wall modifying enzymes were much more abundant in roots compared to 337 above - ground parts in rhd2 - 1 ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . 338 Our proteomic data point also to malfunction of vesicular transport in rhd2 - 1 mutant due to 339 the changed abundance of 3 components of ESCRT endosomal sorting complex , a component 340 of the retromer complex , two components of SNARE ( SOLUBLE N - ETHYLMALEIMIDE 341 SENSITIVE FACTOR ATTACHMENT PROTEIN ) complex , a subunit of conserved 342 oligomeric Golgi complex , and exocyst complex ( Table 2 ) . In addition , CLATHRIN HEAVY 343 CHAIN 1 was 1 . 78 fold upregulated in above - ground parts of rhd2 - 1 ( Table 2 ) . Identified 344 proteins with altered abundances leading to malfunction of vesicular trafficking in rhd2 - 1 345 mutant may directly cause misbalance in PIPs distribution and abundance in membranes , as 346 vesicles are responsible for their targeted delivery . Independent validation by immunoblotting 347 analysis supported upregulation of CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN in above - ground parts of 348 rhd2 - 1 ( Figure 6 ) , in agreement with the proteomic data . 349 Two alpha TUBULIN isoforms ( TUA2 and TUA6 ) showed higher abundances in the rhd2 - 1 350 mutant compared to Col - 0 ( Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ) . These data , together with the 351 simultaneous upregulation of MICROTUBULE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 70 - 2 ( MAP70 - 2 ) 352 indicate possible new link between NADPH oxidases and microtubule organisation . This 353 12 finding may pose a high significance to other processes in rhd2 - 1 mutant to be affected at the 354 proteome level , like altered abundances of PIPs , which are eventually transported and targeted 355 to PM ( similarly to cellulose synthase complexes ) using cortical microtubules . Therefore , we 356 generated transgenic Col - 0 and rhd2 - 1 lines expressing a microtubule marker mRFP - TUB6 357 and performed a detailed advanced lattice LSFM analysis to reveal the cortical microtubule 358 organisation in root epidermal cells . We did not observe obvious differences between Col - 0 359 and rhd2 - 1 in the microtubule organisation in epidermal cells in the transition zone of the 360 primary root ( Figure 7A , B , E ) . Microtubules were oriented prevalently perpendicular to the 361 root longitudinal axis ( Figure 7A , B ) with negligible deviations in microtubule orientation 362 angles ( Figure 7E ) . On the other hand , microtubules in epidermal cells of the root elongation 363 zone showed higher level of anisotropy in the rhd2 - 1 mutant compared to Col - 0 ( Figure 7C , 364 D ) with shift in the orientation angles ( Figure 7F ) . Dynamic time - lapse lattice LSFM imaging 365 of cortical microtubule orientation revealed similar trend between root epidermal cells of Col - 366 0 and rhd2 - 1 in the root transition zone ( Figure 7G ) , but substantially different trend in the 367 root elongation zone ( Figure 7H ) . 368 Due to the substantial deregulation of proteins involved in membrane trafficking and the 369 known dependence of the vesicular trafficking on actin cytoskeleton dynamics , we also aimed 370 to examine the actin cytoskeleton in roots of rhd2 - 1 mutant . The hypothesis indicating a 371 possible alteration of actin cytoskeleton in rhd2 - 1 mutant is supported also by decreased 372 expression of genes encoding actin - binding proteins in rhd2 - 1 transcriptome ( Jones et al . , 373 2006 ) . We analysed actin velocity in root epidermal cells of Col - 0 GFP - FABD2 and rhd2 - 1 374 GFP - FABD2 transgenic lines using lattice LSFM . Velocity of actin filaments was semi - 375 quantitatively analysed by colour - coding determination of movement speed in nm / s , 376 supplemented by vectoral display of changes . This analysis combined velocity fluctuations 377 with their spatial distribution , characterising thus actin filament dynamics in more thorough 378 manner ( Figure 8 ) . It revealed a considerable reduction of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in 379 rhd2 - 1 mutant ( Figure 8A - D ) . Direct time - lapse recording of actin filament velocity in root 380 epidermal cells confirmed its reduction in rhd2 - 1 GFP - FABD2 transgenic line as compared to 381 Col - 0 GFP - FABD2 ( Figure 8E ; Supplementary Movie S1 ) . 382 In summary , loss - of - function mutation in AtRBOHC / RHD2 gene caused pleiotropic 383 proteome - wide effects on plant development and altered drought stress response . It was likely 384 caused by altered defective root - to - shoot signalling , membrane and vesicular transport , 385 microtubule organisation and actin filament dynamics . 386 13 Discussion 387 Differential proteomic analysis revealed that functional mutation in RBOHC / RHD2 affected 388 PM - localised aquaporins ( PIPs ) . These proteins facilitate water membrane diffusion and 389 regulate the root hydraulic conductivity ( Maurel et al . , 2015 ) . PIPs are implicated in plant 390 abiotic and biotic stress responses ( Afzal et al . , 2016 ) and their genetic modification 391 substantially modulates the plant stress response ( Zhou et al . , 2014 ) . They are subjected to 392 constant endocytic recycling that is experimentally proved mostly on PIP2 isoform ( Besserer 393 et al . , 2012 ; Martinière et al . , 2019 ) . After biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum , they are 394 transported via Golgi apparatus to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , and might either be 395 delivered to PM , recycled , or directed to the multivesicular body ( MVB ) for degradation 396 ( Hachez et al . , 2013 ; Chevalier and Chaumont , 2015 ) . The dynamic cycling of AtPIP2 ; 1 in 397 control conditions through the constitutive endocytosis from the PM to internal compartments 398 is executed by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . The cycle starts by endocytosis , 399 proceeds through transfer to the TGN , and further recycling back to the PM ( Chevalier and 400 Chaumont , 2015 ) . The insertion of PIPs into PM occurs via a SNARE complex ( Besserer et 401 al . , 2012 ; Hachez et al . , 2014 ) , and is regulated by homo - and heteromerisation ( Otto et al . , 402 2010 ) as well as posttranslational regulation of PIPs ( Santoni , 2017 ) . PIPs are internalised to 403 cells via clathrin - mediated or clathrin - independent lipid raft - associated endocytosis ( Hachez 404 et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , subcellular trafficking of PIPs is sensitive to external conditions and 405 its disruption alters the membrane water permeability ( Wudick et al . , 2015 ) . 406 Arabidopsis rhd2 - 1 mutant dramatically differed from Col - 0 in proteins involved in vesicular 407 transport including ESCRT , SNARE , COG , exocyst and retromer complexes . ESCRT 408 complex is involved in MVB biogenesis , but ESCRT proteins are also essential for protein 409 recycling from endosomes to the PM , sorting ubiquitinated cargoes into 410 lysosomes / vacuoles , exosome secretion and autophagy ( Gao et al . , 2017 ) . ESCRT - I 411 component ELC , also named as VPS23 ( 2 . 9 fold upregulated in the rhd2 - 1 mutant ) affects the 412 subcellular localisation of SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 2 ( SOS2 ) to the PM , thus essentially 413 modulating plant salt stress tolerance ( Lou et al . , 2020 ) . 414 Retromer recycles vacuolar sorting receptors from the TGN ( Niemes et al . , 2010 ) . It also 415 mediates the retrograde recycling of biosynthetic cargo receptors back to the TGN / Golgi and 416 endocytic cargos back to the PM ( González Solís et al . , 2022 ) . Retromer subunits VPS29 ( 1 . 5 417 fold upregulated in the rhd2 - 1 mutant ) and VPS35A are important for prevacuolar 418 compartment ( PVC ) function in Arabidopsis ( Nodzy ń ski et al . , 2013 ) . VPS29 is also required 419 14 for endosome homeostasis , PIN protein cycling , and dynamic PIN1 repolarisation during 420 development ( Jaillais et al . , 2007 ) . 421 SNAREs mediate membrane fusions and confer membrane fusion specificity . Qa - SNARE 422 SYP22 ( downregulated in the rhd2 - 1 mutant ) is involved in the vacuolar transport pathway of 423 Arabidopsis and is localised to prevacuolar compartments and tonoplast ( Uemura et al . , 424 2004 ) . SYP22 , together with VAMP727 , regulate BRI1 targeting to PM , contributing to plant 425 growth in Arabidopsis ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Another protein differentially regulated in the 426 rhd2 - 1 mutant , involved in PM targeting , was PROPHOSPHOINOSITIDE PHOSPHATASE 427 SAC8 ( downregulated in rhd2 - 1 roots ) . It is required for PtdIns4P , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 homeostasis 428 and is implicated in trafficking of the PM - localised proteins PIN1 and PIN2 from TGN back 429 to PM ( Song et al . , 2021 ) . The role of PtdIns4P and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in the internalisation of 430 AtPIP2 ; 1 from the PM to the vacuole under salt stress was linked to phosphatidylinositol 3 - 431 kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase . This internalisation proceeded through clathrin - 432 mediated endocytosis ( Ueda et al . , 2016 ) . The process of AtPIP2 ; 1 recycling from the PM via 433 clathrin - mediated endocytosis under control conditions may , however , switch to clathrin - 434 independent endocytosis induced by salt stress ( Luu et al . , 2012 ) . Such significant alterations 435 and defects in vesicular transport might be a reason of a substantially changed abundance of 436 PM and tonoplast - localised proteins in the rhd2 - 1 mutant , including the PIP1 isoforms . It is 437 likely that loss of AtRBOHC / RHD2 function might essentially affect the protein delivery to 438 the PM and tonoplast , leading to diverse physiological consequences . 439 The mechanism linking ROS - producing activities of RBOHC to such effects is elusive . 440 Endocytosis of PIP2 - 1 depends on ROS produced by RBOHD and its clustering during salt 441 stress in Arabidopsis ( Martinière et al . , 2019 ) . Although a similar regulatory mechanism 442 might be assigned also to RBOHC , it hardly can be generalised to all proteins found in this 443 proteomic screen . In agreement , PM - localised proton ATPase ( PM H + - ATPase ) AHA2 444 showed a RBOHD - independent pattern of recycling during osmotic stress ( Martinière et al . , 445 2019 ) . 446 Our results indicate that apart from root hair growth regulation , the production of ROS by 447 AtRBOHC / RHD2 is likely important for the amount and stability of PIP1 isoforms , affecting 448 the Arabidopsis drought stress response . It has been shown that endocytic internalisation of 449 PIPs into intracellular compartments under abiotic stresses such as drought , was directly 450 related to the effort of plants to downregulate root water transport due to water deprivation 451 under stress conditions . The rate of exchange between the PM and intracellular compartments 452 15 of AtPIP1 ; 2 and AtPIP2 ; 1 revealed that the aquaporin recycling was greater under salt stress 453 than under control conditions ( Luu et al . , 2012 ) . This may reflect also differences at the 454 shoot - to - root ratio of PIPs abundance level . Studies in Arabidopsis revealed discrepancies 455 between the level of mRNA expression and the protein abundances of PIPs . Frequently after 456 drought stress , a higher PIPs protein levels were observed in shoots and less in roots ( Yepes - 457 Molina et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , it has been shown that under drought stress , the expression 458 level of AtPIP2 ; 5 was increased in the aerial parts of Arabidopsis plants ( Jang et al . , 2004 ) . 459 Nevertheless , the drought stress sensitivity of rhd2 - 1 mutant is most likely determined also by 460 other PM residing proteins found in the proteomic screen , such as PM H + - ATPase AHA2 ( Pei 461 et al . , 2022 ) , CASPARIAN STRIP MEMBRANE DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 ( CASP1 ) ( Roppolo 462 et al . , 2014 ; Kamiya et al . , 2015 ) , and ABCG32 ( Seo and Park , 2011 ) . 463 In conclusion , proteomic analysis uncovered , that the functional mutation in RBOHC / RHD2 464 leads to substantial defects in vesicular transport , affecting homeostasis of proteins residing at 465 the PM , and alteration of plant drought stress response . 466 Microtubules are fundamental components of the cytoskeleton inevitable for cell division , 467 growth and morphogenesis . They also perceive signals derived from external environment , 468 including mechanical stimuli , ROS , abiotic and biotic stresses ( Nick et al . , 2013 ) . 469 Microtubules in stomata guard cells regulate stomatal closure and water loss by controlling 470 AtPIP2 ; 1 dynamic behaviour at PM ( Cui et al . , 2021 ) . Our results point to the dependence of 471 PIP1 aquaporin isoforms abundances on root specific AtRBOHC / RHD2 expression , and the 472 concomitant increased levels of cortical microtubule isotropy in rhd2 - 1 mutant imply that 473 microtubules may mediate the AtRBOHC / RHD2 - dependent PIP1 dynamics . It has been 474 shown that in the roots of the halophyte ice plant ( Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L . ) under 475 salinity stress conditions abundance of PIPs at the PM was altered . It was demonstrated that 476 the amount of McPIP1 ; 4 and McPIP2 ; 1 increased at the PM under salinity conditions and 477 their trafficking was performed by clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) . The proteomic analysis 478 from positively charged microsome fractions revealed McPIPs interactions with CCV - 479 associated proteins , such as the CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN ( CHC ) , further confirmed by 480 CCV enrichment assays and immunoblotting using anti - CHC antibody ( Gómez - Méndez et 481 al . , 2023 ) . Most likely , the microtubule reorientation in rhd2 - 1 mutant is related to the altered 482 ROS production , as chemical modulation of ROS was reported to alter their integrity ( Livanos 483 et al . , 2014 ) . These alterations in cortical microtubule dynamic properties and orientation are 484 likely associated with an increased abundance of yet uncharacterised MICROTUBULE 485 16 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 70 - 2 ( MAP70 - 2 ) , belonging to a plant - specific MAP70 family 486 ( Korolev et al . , 2005 ) . Further , increased abundances of two TUBULIN isoforms may 487 indicate their altered turnover in the rhd2 - 1 mutant . 488 Our results show that AtRBOHC / RHD2 may be important for actin dynamics as well . The 489 link between RBOH and actin was established previously showing that ROS generated by 490 RBOHD is important for actin rearrangements during innate immunity ( Li et al . , 2017 ; Cao et 491 al . , 2022 ) . Additional work revealed that FLS2 endocytosis was inhibited by the myosin 492 inhibitor 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime , as well as treatment with Lat B . These results suggest 493 that the ligand - mediated endocytosis of pathogenesis - related receptors requires the actin 494 cytoskeleton ( Beck et al . , 2012 ) . However , in comparison to other systems like yeast , actin 495 participation has not been proved at the spots of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in plants . 496 Actin is , however , involved in further delivery of post - endocytic vesicles , for their 497 intracellular movement , interaction with endosomal compartments , and for cargo sorting 498 ( Aniento et al . , 2022 ; Narasimhan et al . , 2020 ) . Actin cytoskeleton and actin - associated 499 proteins were already linked to plant stress reactions . Stomatal closure during drought stress is 500 regulated by ABA signalling that regulates actin reorganization ( Shi et al . , 2022 ) . It has been 501 shown that SWR1 ( SWI2 / SNF2 - RELATED CHROMATIN REMODELLING 1 ) complex is 502 involved in positive regulation of the expression levels of stress - responsive ABA 503 INSENSITIVE 1 ( ABI1 ) and ABI2 genes . Interestingly , ACTIN - RELATED PROTEIN 6 504 ( ARP6 ) is one component of this complex and in line with that , the arp6 mutant was more 505 sensitive to salt stress . Transcript levels of ABI1 and ABI2 genes were significantly lower in 506 arp6 mutant after salt treatment ( Do et al . , 2023 ) . Cytosolic ABA Receptor Kinase 3 507 ( CARK3 ) is involved in phosphorylation of ABA receptors , mediating ABA signalling 508 pathway . CARK3 interacts with ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZATION FACTOR 4 ( ADF4 ) and 509 regulates it by phosphorylation . Interestingly , overexpression of ADF4 enhanced drought 510 resistance of tested plants and soil drought tolerance assay revealed that the survival of adf4 511 mutant was significantly lower in comparison to control plants after drought treatment ( Peng 512 et al . , 2022 ) . The role of ADF4 was approved also in stomatal closure , which was mediated 513 through reorganisation of actin filaments ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . Other study revealed ADF5 - 514 related F - actin - bundling activity , which was positively involved in regulation of drought 515 stress response . This was documented by increased drought stress sensitivity of adf5 mutant 516 ( Qian et al . , 2019 ) . Similarly , cotton GhVLN4 responsible for actin microfilament bundling , 517 upon overexpression in Arabidopsis , conferred resistance to Verticilium dahliae , salt and 518 17 drought stresses ( Ge et al . , 2021 ) . As demonstrated by our results , AtRBOHC / RHD2 may be 519 another RBOH isoform mediating actin dynamics in Arabidopsis , possibly influencing also 520 the phenotypical changes in root hair development of rhd2 - 1 mutant . It is likely , that the 521 altered ROS production might contribute to modification of actin dynamics involved in the 522 root hair phenotype of rhd2 - 1 mutant . Lower actin dynamics is most likely linked to the 523 altered endosomal motility in the rhd2 - 1 mutant . Indeed , movements of TGN / early 524 endosomes visualised with GFP - RabA1d were affected in the bulging domains of the rhd2 - 1 525 mutant ( Kub ě nová et al . , 2022 ) . Here we show that early endosomal protein BREFELDIN A - 526 INHIBITED GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE - EXCHANGE PROTEIN 5 ( BIG5 ; Tanaka et al . , 527 2009 ) , usually abundant in the primary root differentiation zone ( Table 1 ) , was downregulated 528 in the rhd2 - 1 mutant and might contribute to its root hair phenotype . 529 All in all , altered abundances of PIPs , CLATHRIN , ESCRT , SNAREs along with cortical 530 microtubule reorganisation might significantly contribute to the developmental phenotype of 531 rhd2 - 1 and its higher sensitivity to drought stress . 532 Author contributions 533 TT , LK , OŠ , PD , JH and STB performed the experiments and analyses .
