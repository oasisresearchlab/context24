The fish skin provides an 11 environmental barrier and protects against invading pathogens . However , both pathogens and 12 physical insults cause skin wounds that are of major concern in modern fish farming . The 13 behavior and interactions between keratocyte cells and sheets of cells are not well understood . 14 The collective migration of keratocytes ( skin epithelial cells ) is of central importance for wound 15 healing in fish . In this study , we aimed to elucidate the complex wound healing process in fish 16 skin by studying in vitro cultures of these highly motile cells . Using explant cultures from 17 farmed Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) and differential interference contrast microscopy ( DIC ) , 18 we have captured the dynamics of sheets of cells from harvested fish scales and of individual 19 cells interacting in the cell sheet vicinity . In addition to direct contact , the cells were observed to 20 interact through long membrane tubes , turn , rotate , merge , and / or detach . Additionally , stationary 21 cells and cells moving on top of the cell sheets were observed . Cell sheets approaching one 22 another from different scales did not merge but dispersed . 23 © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Publishing Group Publishing Agreement 24 1 . Introduction 25 The fish skin provides a barrier to environmental cues and against invading pathogens . Some 26 infectious pathogens and physical insults cause skin wounds [ 1 ] , which have to be re - epithelized 27 and remodeled quickly to sustain the barrier function . In fact , small wounds may be healed within 28 a few hours [ 2 ] , depending on the environmental temperature . Keratocytes cover the dermis which 29 is composed of dense connective tissue , fibroblasts , pigment cells and blood capillaries [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . 30 Intact skin is crucial for animals’ defence against pathogens . In fishing industry , salmon louse 31 infestation is a huge concern for animal welfare . Non - medicinal treatments include physical 32 delousing processes such as freshwater bathing , warm water dips , use of lasers to kill individual 33 lice on the fish , mechanical removal of parasites by soft brushes and / or high - pressure pumps [ 5 ] . 34 Such physical treatments are likely to affect the fish skin integrity as well as the activity of 35 keratocytes , which are important for tissue remodeling . The migratory behavior of keratocytes 36 ( skin epithelial cells ) is a key feature during wound repair . It has been shown that the speed of 37 the fish moga ( Hypsophrys nicaraguensis ) keratocytes is approximately 15 µ m / min ( 23 ° C ) in 38 vitro [ 6 ] . This finding is similar to the previous results presented by [ 7 ] where the velocity of 39 black tetra ( Gymnocorymbus ternetzi ) keratocytes was calculated to be 15 µ m / min . There are 40 numerous studies on fish keratocytes that have described the migratory features of individual 41 cells [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . However , the far more complex behavior of sheets of cells – as found in fish skin 42 – is comparatively unexplored . Here , cells are seen to transition between leader and follower cell 43 morphology . The leader cells at cell - sheet edges typically exhibit the characteristic keratocyte 44 fan - shape and appear to determine the direction of the entire sheet of cells . The follower cells are 45 within the cell sheet and follow the movement of the neighboring cells [ 11 ] [ 12 ] . 46 Using explant cultures from farmed Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) and differential interference 47 contrast microscopy ( DIC ) , we have observed both the advance of sheets of cells coming off the 48 harvested fish scales and the interactions of individual cells detaching and recombining both with 49 other cells and with the cell sheet . In this work , we show videos of Atlantic salmon keratocytes 50 acquired at room temperature , and discuss their complex dynamics as observed in scale explant 51 cultures . 52 2 . Materials and Methods 53 2 . 1 . Cell harvesting and cultivation 54 The imaged cells were primary epidermal skin cells ( mainly keratocytes ) obtained from Atlantic 55 salmon scales . The scale harvest was conducted with disinfected tweezers on farmed salmon 56 in air , killed with a blow to the head . This method is allowed according to the Norwegian 57 Regulations for use of animals in experimentation ( https : / / lovdata . no / dokument / SF / 58 forskrift / 2015 - 06 - 18 - 761 # KAPITTEL _ 10 ) and complies with the corresponding 59 EU legislation - Directive 2010 / 63 / EU ( http : / / data . europa . eu / eli / dir / 2010 / 60 63 / oj ) . The scales were placed on # 1 . 5 glass - bottom dishes ( 734 - 2904 , VWR ) and dried 61 on for about 1 - 2 minutes ( to make the scales stick to the dish ) before adding antibiotic buffer 62 solution : Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS , Corning , # 21 - 023 - CM ) with 100 IU / mL 63 Penicillin - Streptomycin ( P / S , Sigma , P0781 ) and 1 µ g / mL Amphotericin B ( PanReac AppliChem , 64 # A7009 ) . The short dry period did not appear to damage the harvested cells . The cells were 65 kept at 4 ° C in a watertight box , replacing the old medium with fresh every 2 - 3 days . Scales 66 that loosened during cell culture and sample preparation were removed from the culture dish . 67 Before imaging , loose cells and mucus were washed away by changing the media to a fresh HBSS 68 antibiotic solution . 69 2 . 2 . Image acquisition 70 Imaging was performed at room temperature using a DeltaVision Elite microscope ( GE Healthcare ) 71 equipped with a DIC module , and an Olympus 10X , 0 . 4NA or 20X , 0 . 75NA objective . Unless 72 otherwise stated , the DIC module with the 10X objective was used . The microscope focus 73 together with the contrast of the DIC module were manually optimized to maximize the visibility 74 of the lamellipodia of leading - edge keratocytes adherent to the glass - substrate . For long - duration 75 time - lapses , the keratocytes were maintained in sharp contrast with help of the microscope’s 76 inbuilt focus maintenance system . The exact acquisition parameters for all raw image data are 77 available with the published dataset [ 13 ] . 78 2 . 3 . Image processing and analysis 79 All image processing ( linear contrast adjustment , file conversion , insertion of scale bars , etc . ) 80 was conducted in Fiji [ 14 ] . The stitched images ( combining multiple smaller field - of - views , files 81 labeled STC ) were generated using the Fiji plugin Grid / Collection Stitching [ 15 ] . 82 3 . Results 83 With the explant culture preparation described under Material and Methods , two different image 84 acquisition schemes were conducted over 0 - 4 days after sample harvesting : 85 I . 2 min time - lapses ( for up to about 24 hours ) often consisting of multiple adjacent images 86 together covering a large sample area ( e . g . 3 × 3 mm 2 . ) where cells ( or sheets of cells ) 87 were starting to come of the scale ( i . e . , a beginning cell avalanche ) . 88 II . 5 s time - lapses ( for up to 14 hours ) covering a single field - of - view ( either 668 × 668 µ m 2 89 for 10X lens , or 334 × 334 µ m 2 using a 20X lens ) close to a scale edge . 90 Approach I enabled an overview of the scale avalanche ( large sheet of keratocytes ) dynamics 91 over a relatively long time - frame and large field - of - view to be captured , while at the same time 92 achieving sufficient image resolution and contrast to capture individual cell dynamics , including 93 the very thin lamellipodia of the cell sheet leader cells , as demonstrated in Figure 1 . Video 1 94 shows an overview of the full avalanche dynamics . Similarly , Video 2 shows an overview of a 95 different sample , but here of two approaching avalanches from two different salmon scales ( but 96 from the same fish ) . Surprisingly , such avalanches were not found to merge but rather tended 97 to disperse or avoid each other . Considering that cell avalanches in vivo are supposed to cover 98 skin wounds , we expected to see the avalanches merging . The temperature or phototoxicity for 99 imaging could be important contributors to this behavior , especially since we found multi - scale 100 dishes ( kept at 4 ° C protected from light ) to eventually be fully covered by cells after enough days 101 on a dish . 102 With approach II , we were better able to study cell - cell interaction and details of their complex 103 behaviour . The following section outlines some interesting observations regarding individual 104 and inter - cell interactions following approach II . 105 Fig . 1 . Live imaging of explant scale culture of Atlantic salmon 3 days after harvest . Epithelial cell avalanches ( as seen coming off the scale in the main panel ) are important in the wound healing mechanisms of fish skin . This approach enabled an overview of the explant culture cell avalanche to be captured at the same time as achieving sufficient resolution and contrast to investigate individual cell and lamellipodium dynamics ( right panels ) . The left panel is a tiled view of 5 × 6 DIC images . The cell avalanche shown had already been imaged for 390 min ( every 2 min ) at room temperature . No nutrition was provided to the culture medium ( antibiotic - supplemented HBSS ) . 3 . 1 . Cell dynamics ( 5 s time - lapse ) 106 Different from the unidirectional motion normally described following keratocyte analysis , 107 our explant culture data show a broad range of different cell behavior and motion patterns , as 108 outlined in Figure 2 . Some changes in propagation direction are clearly induced by direct contact 109 with other cells or membrane tubes ( see Video 3 ) , but also single cells without no apparent 110 direct cell contact were found to change the direction of propagation , as can be seen from the 111 time - lapse displayed in Figure 3 and Video 4 , where a cell turns following apparent folding of its 112 lamellipodium . Figure 4 and Video 5 display a rotating cell ( or collection of cells ) , seemingly 113 caused by a combination of keratocyte cells migrating in opposite directions . 114 Interestingly , also cells moving independently on top of the keratocyte cell sheet were observed 115 ( Video 6 and indicated by yellow arrows in Figure 5 ) . These cells appear different from keratocyte 116 cells in migratory behavior and morphology , although they have not been further characterized 117 beyond the visual observation . 118 Fig . 2 . Color - coded time - lapse of keratocyte video : each color represents a different time - point according to the sequence indicated by the color bar ( 50 s between each color ) . Cells undergo several different dynamical patterns : cells are turning , rotating , interacting through membrane tubes , and cells are moving on top of the retracting cell layer . Scale bar : 50 µ m . The figure was created with help of a Temporal - Color Coder script , provided by Kota Miura at the Centre for Molecular and Cellular Imaging , EMBL Heidelberg , Germany . 4 . Discussion 119 We have in this work investigated the ability of label - free DIC microscopy to study the dynamics 120 of Atlantic salmon keratocyte cells using explant cultures . The collective behavior of keratocyte 121 cells is highly relevant for further understanding of the defense mechanisms of fish skin . Rather 122 than providing conclusive measurements regarding individual cell speed , morphology or chemical 123 Fig . 3 . Time sequence of a cell balling up and turning . Scale bars : 20 µ m .

Scale bars : 20 µ m . constitution , this report aims to highlight the suitability of DIC and label - free microscopy methods 124 for the study both of primary cells and collective cell dynamics . 125 The collective behavior of cells over different length scales and image resolutions is a 126 challenging target for both manual and automated analysis . The cells are constantly moving , 127 interacting and changing their shape and propagation direction . The cell image contrast is poor 128 compared to the surrounding medium . Although the image contrast can in general be improved 129 using fluorescence imaging techniques , the requirement of fluorescent labeling and the associated 130 increase of phototoxicity alters the biological system and significantly reduces the possible 131 duration of time - lapse studies and the ability to follow a cell population over time . 132 From our videos , many interesting observations can be made . The large field - of - view time - 133 lapse studies ( imaging many adjacent panels every 2 min over several hours ) , indicate that 134 approaching avalanches in general do not merge , but rather dispersed or avoid each other , even 135 when all cells originated from the same fish . This was observed three out of three times but could 136 be related to the temperature or light exposure during imaging . Observing meeting avalanches 137 was a relatively rare event as it is hard to predict exactly where from a scale an avalanche will 138 emanate and two different scales must be placed at the right distance from one another for 139 observation . We also noted that the progression was very slow – or even completely halted – of 140 the scale explant cultures while kept at 4 ° C compared to room temperature . This slow keratocyte 141 migration could be a key contributor to the increased presence of skin wounds in farmed fish 142 during the winter season [ 16 ] . 143 The single field - of - view videos ( imaged every 5 s ) were particularly suitable for revealing 144 single - cell dynamics and their interactions . The DIC microscope provided relatively good 145 contrast of even the very thin lamellipodium and long membrane tubes . Cells were observed to 146 turn , rotate , and to move on top of the cell sheets . The microscope’s in - built focus lock system 147 was important to maintain the cells and their thin lamellipodium ( extending on the glass substrate ) 148 in focus during several hours of imaging . 149 The videos trigger many questions concerning keratocyte cells and fish biology . Which factors 150 determine the keratocyte path of propagation ? Do the cells divide in culture or are they just 151 advancing down from the harvested scales ? From where do they derive their energy ? Most of 152 our data were acquired of cells in a saline solution only ( HBSS with antibiotics ) , without any 153 nutritional supplements commonly used in cell growth medium and fetal calf serum . Without 154 any growth medium supplements , the cells were observed active for up to 9 days after harvest , 155 contained in only HBSS medium and antibiotics . The cells were kept at 4 ° C until imaging , then 156 at room temperature . Future studies will investigate for how long after harvest keratocyte cells 157 remain active and further how conditions like temperature or cell culture medium supplements 158 affect the durability of salmon skin cells . 159 The analytical complexity of label - free bioimage analysis combined with the enormous 160 variability of motion pattern of salmon epithelial cells make it essential to develop suitable tools 161 for automated analysis . This will enable a rigorous quantitative assessment of the cell population 162 effects of e . g . different chemicals , pathogens , nutrients or temperature changes . 163 In summary , we have shown label - free DIC microscopy as a promising tool to study both 164 single cells and collective dynamics of salmon scale explant cultures . We hope our videos will 165 inspire many future studies of the collective behavior of fish skin cells and the development of 166 analysis software that can accelerate the quantitative assessment of such and similar label - free 167 bioimage videos . The data generated in this study is available on the research data archive 168 DataverseNO [ 13 ] , and includes both the full image data as well as easy to visualize down - sampled 169 movies to enable a quick overview of the extensive time - lapse data . 170 Funding .
