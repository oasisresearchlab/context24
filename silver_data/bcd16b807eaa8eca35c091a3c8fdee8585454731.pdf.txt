Redner 1 1 Center for BioDynamics , Center for Polymer Studies , and Department of Physics , Boston University , Boston , MA 02215 2 Department of Mathematical Sciences , Brunel University , Uxbridge , Middlesex , UB8 3PH , UK The in - degree and out - degree distributions of a growing network model are determined . The in - degree is the number of incoming links to a given node ( and vice versa for out - degree ) . The network is built by ( i ) creation of new nodes which each immediately attach to a pre - existing node , and ( ii ) creation of new links between pre - existing nodes . This process naturally generates correlated in - and out - degree distributions . When the node and link creation rates are linear functions of node degree , these distributions exhibit distinct power - law forms . By tuning the parameters in these rates to reasonable values , exponents which agree with those of the web graph are obtained . PACS numbers : 02 . 50 . Cw , 05 . 40 . - a , 05 . 50 . + q , 87 . 18 . Sn The world - wide web ( WWW ) is a rapidly evolving net - work which now contains nearly 10 9 nodes . Much recent eﬀort has been devoted to characterizing the underlying directed graph formed by these nodes and their connect - ing hyperlinks – the so - called “web” graph [ 1 – 4 ] . In par - allel with these developments , a variety of growing net - work models have recently been introduced and studied [ 5 – 14 ] . These model networks are built by sequentially adding both nodes and links in a manner which mimics the evolution of real network systems , with the WWW being the most obvious example . One fundamental characteristic of any graph is the number of links at a node – the node degree . The growing network models cited above predict that the distribution of node degree has a power law form for growth rules in which the probability that a newly - created node at - taches to a pre - existing node increases linearly with the degree of the “target” node [ 5 – 8 ] . This power law behav - ior strongly contrasts with the Poisson degree distribu - tion of the classical random graphs [ 15 ] , where links are randomly created between any pair of pre - existing nodes in the network . i = 4 j = 5 FIG . 1 . A node with in - degree i = 4 , out - degree j = 5 , and total degree 9 . Since web links are directed , the total degree of a node may naturally be resolved into the in - degree – the num - ber of incoming links to a node , and out - degree – the number of outgoing links from a node ( Fig . 1 ) . While the total node degree and its distribution are now rea - sonably understood [ 5 – 8 , 11 ] , little is known about the joint distribution of in - degrees and out - degrees , as well as their correlation . Empirical measurements of the web indicate that in - degree and out - degree distributions ex - hibit power - law behaviors with diﬀerent exponents [ 2 – 4 ] . In this Letter , we solve for the joint distribution in a simple growing network model . We are able to repro - duce the observed in - degree and out - degree distributions of the web as well as ﬁnd correlations between in - and out - degrees of each node . Our model represents an extension of growing network models with node and link creation [ 13 , 14 ] to incorpo - rate link directionality . The network growth occurs by two distinct processes ( Fig . 2 ) : ( i ) With probability p , a new node is introduced and it immediately attaches to one of the earlier target nodes in the network . The attachment probability depends only on the in - degree of the target . ( ii ) With probability q = 1 − p , a new link is created between already existing nodes . The choices of the originating and target nodes depend on the out - degree of the originating node and the in - degree of the target node . ( ii ) ( i ) FIG . 2 . Illustration of the growth processes in the growing network model : ( i ) node creation and immediate attachment , and ( ii ) link creation . In ( i ) the new node is shaded , while in both ( i ) and ( ii ) the new link is dashed . If only process ( i ) was allowed , the out - degree of each node would be one by construction . Process ( ii ) has been shown to drive a transition in the network structure [ 14 ] . We shall further show that this general model gives a non - trivial out - degree distribution which is distinct from the in - degree distribution . We begin our analysis by determining the average node degree ; this can be done without speciﬁcation of the at - 1 tachment and link creation probabilities . Let N ( t ) be the total number of nodes in the network , and let I ( t ) and J ( t ) be the total in - degree and out - degree , respectively . According to the two basic growth processes enumerated above , at each time step these degrees evolve according to one of the following two possibilities ( N , I , J ) → (cid:26) ( N + 1 , I + 1 , J + 1 ) probability p , ( N , I + 1 , J + 1 ) probability q . ( 1 ) That is , with probability p a new node and new directed link are created ( Fig . 2 ) so that the number of nodes and both node degrees increase by one . Conversely , with probability q a new directed link is created and the node degrees each increase by one , while the total number of nodes is unchanged . As a result , N ( t ) = pt , I ( t ) = J ( t ) = t , ( 2 ) from which we immediately conclude that the average in - and out - degrees , D in ≡ I ( t ) / N ( t ) and D out ≡ J ( t ) / N ( t ) , are both time independent and equal to 1 / p . To determine the joint degree distributions , we need to specify : ( i ) the attachment rate A ( i , j ) , deﬁned as the probability that a newly - introduced node links to an ex - isting node with i incoming and j outgoing links , and ( ii ) the creation rate C ( i 1 , j 1 | i 2 , j 2 ) , deﬁned as the prob - ability of adding a new link from a ( i 1 , j 1 ) node to a ( i 2 , j 2 ) node . We restrict the form of these rates to those which we naturally expect to occur in systems such as the web graph . First , we assume that the attachment rate depends only on the in - degree of the target node , A ( i , j ) = A i . We also assume that the link creation rate depends only on the out - degree of the node from which it emanates and the in - degree of the target node , that is , C ( i 1 , j 1 | i 2 , j 2 ) = C ( j 1 , i 2 ) . On general grounds , the attachment and creation rates A i and C ( j , i ) should be non - decreasing functions of i and j . For example , a web - page designer is more likely to construct hyperlinks to well - known pages rather than to obscure pages . Similarly , a web page with many outgoing hyperlinks is more likely to create even more hyperlinks . We have found that the degree distributions exhibit qual - itatively diﬀerent behaviors depending on whether the asymptotic dependence of the rates A i and C ( j , i ) on both i and j grow slower than linearly , linearly , or faster than linearly . The ﬁrst and last cases lead to either rapidly decaying degree distributions or to the dominance of a single node ; this same behavior was already found for the total node degree [ 7 , 11 ] . The most interesting be - havior arises for asymptotically linear rates , and we focus on this class of models in our investigations . Speciﬁcally , we consider the model with attachment and creation rates which are shifted linear functions in all indices ( linear - bilinear rates ) A i = i + λ , C ( j , i ) = ( i + λ ) ( j + µ ) . ( 3 ) An intuitively natural feature of this model is that both the attachment and creation rates have the same depen - dence on the popularity of the target node . The pa - rameters λ and µ in the rates of Eq . ( 3 ) must obey the constraints λ > 0 and µ > − 1 to ensure that the corre - sponding rates are positive for all permissible values of in - and out - degrees , i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 1 . As the network grows , the joint degree distribution , N ij ( t ) , deﬁned as the average number of nodes with i incoming and j outgoing links , builds up . To solve for N ij ( t ) , we shall use the rate equation approach , which has recently been applied to simpler versions of growing networks [ 7 , 8 , 11 ] . When the attachment and creation rates are given by Eq . ( 3 ) , the degree distribution N ij ( t ) evolves according to the rate equations dN ij dt = ( p + q ) (cid:20) ( i − 1 + λ ) N i − 1 , j − ( i + λ ) N ij I + λN (cid:21) ( 4 ) + q (cid:20) ( j − 1 + µ ) N i , j − 1 − ( j + µ ) N ij J + µN (cid:21) + p δ i 0 δ j 1 . The ﬁrst group of terms on the right - hand side account for the changes in the in - degree of target nodes . These changes arise by simultaneous creation of a new node and link ( with probability p ) or by creation of a new link only ( with probability q ) . For example , the cre - ation of a link to a node with in - degree i leads to a loss in the number of such nodes . This occurs with rate ( p + q ) ( i + λ ) N ij , divided by the appropriate normaliza - tion factor P i , j ( i + λ ) N ij = I + λN . The factor p + q = 1 in Eq . ( 4 ) has been written to make explicit the two types of relevant processes . Similarly , the terms in the second group of terms accounts for changes in the out - degree . These occur due to the creation of new links between al - ready existing nodes – hence the prefactor q . The last term accounts for the continuous introduction of new nodes with no incoming links and one outgoing link . As a useful self - consistency check , we can easily verify that the total number of nodes , N = P i , j N ij , obeys ˙ N = p , in agreement with Eq . ( 2 ) . In the same spirit , the total in - and out - degrees , I = P i , j iN ij and J = P i , j jN ij , obey ˙ I = ˙ J = 1 . By solving the ﬁrst few of Eqs . ( 4 ) , it is clear that the N ij grow linearly with time . Accordingly , we substitute N ij ( t ) = t n ij , as well as N = pt and I = J = t , into Eqs . ( 4 ) to yield a recursion relation for n ij . Using the shorthand notations , a = q 1 + pλ 1 + pµ and b = 1 + ( 1 + p ) λ , the recursion relation for n ij simpliﬁes to [ i + a ( j + µ ) + b ] n ij = ( i − 1 + λ ) n i − 1 , j + a ( j − 1 + µ ) n i , j − 1 + p ( 1 + pλ ) δ i 0 δ j 1 . ( 5 ) We ﬁrst consider the in - degree and out - degree distribu - tions , I i ( t ) = P j N ij ( t ) and O j ( t ) = P i N ij ( t ) . Because 2 of the linear time dependence of the nodes degrees , we write I i ( t ) = t I i and O j ( t ) = t O j . The densities I i and O j satisfy ( i + b ) I i = ( i − 1 + λ ) I i − 1 + p ( 1 + pλ ) δ i 0 , ( 6 ) (cid:18) j + 1 q + µ q (cid:19) O j = ( j − 1 + µ ) O j − 1 + p 1 + pµ q δ j 1 , ( 7 ) respectively . The solution to these recursion formulae may be expressed in terms of the following ratios of gamma functions I i = I 0 Γ ( i + λ ) Γ ( b + 1 ) Γ ( i + b + 1 ) Γ ( λ ) , ( 8 ) with I 0 = p ( 1 + pλ ) / b , and O j = O 1 Γ ( j + µ ) Γ ( 2 + q − 1 + µq − 1 ) Γ ( j + 1 + q − 1 + µq − 1 ) Γ ( 1 + µ ) , ( 9 ) with O 1 = p ( 1 + pµ ) / ( 1 + q + µ ) . From the asymptotics of the gamma function , the asymptotic behavior of the in - and out - degree distribu - tions have the power law forms , I i ∼ i − ν in , ν in = 2 + pλ , ( 10 ) O j ∼ j − ν out , ν out = 1 + q − 1 + µpq − 1 . ( 11 ) These exponents for the degree distributions constitute one of our primary results . Note that ν in depends on λ ( an in - degree feature ) while ν out depends on µ ( an out - degree feature ) . Notice also that both the exponents are greater than 2 . We can also solve the recursion relation ( 5 ) for n ij when i or j is small . For example , we can express n i 1 as the ratio of two gamma functions . Then we can ex - press n i 2 as the sum of two such ratios , etc . While there appears to be no simple general expression for the joint distribution , we can extract the limiting behaviors of n ij when i or j is large . We ﬁnd n ij ∼ (cid:26) i − ξ in j µ , 1 ≪ j ≪ i ; j − ξ out i λ − 1 , 1 ≪ i ≪ j ; ( 12 ) with ξ in = ν in + q p ( ν in − 1 ) ( ν out − 2 ) ν out − 1 ξ out = ν out + 1 p ( ν out − 1 ) ( ν in − 2 ) ν in − 1 . ( 13 ) Thus the in - and out - degrees of a node are correlated – otherwise , we would have n ij = I i O j ∼ i − ν in j − ν out . This correlation between node degrees is our second basic re - sult . The analytical form of the joint distribution greatly simpliﬁes when ν in = ν out , corresponding to a = 1 and µ + b = 2 λ . In this region of the parameter space , the recursion relation ( 5 ) reduces to ( i + j + 2 λ ) n ij = ( i − 1 + λ ) n i − 1 , j + ( j − 1 + µ ) n i , j − 1 + p ( 1 + pλ ) δ i 0 δ j 1 . ( 14 ) Equation ( 14 ) is simpler than the general recursion ( 5 ) since the node degrees i and j now appear with equal prefactors . This feature allows us to transform Eq . ( 14 ) into a constant - coeﬃcient recursion relation . Indeed , the substitution n ij = Γ ( i + λ ) Γ ( j + µ ) Γ ( i + j + 2 λ + 1 ) m ij ( 15 ) reduces ( 14 ) to m ij = m i − 1 , j + m i , j − 1 + γ δ i 0 δ j 1 , ( 16 ) with γ = p ( 1 + pλ ) Γ ( 1 + 2 λ ) / ( Γ ( λ ) Γ ( µ + 1 ) ) . We solve Eq . ( 16 ) by the generating function technique . Multiply - ing Eq . ( 16 ) by x i y j and summing over all i ≥ 0 , j ≥ 1 yields M ( x , y ) ≡ ∞ X i = 0 ∞ X j = 1 m ij x i y j = γy 1 − x − y . ( 17 ) Expanding this latter expression we obtain m ij = γ Γ ( i + j ) Γ ( i + 1 ) Γ ( j ) . ( 18 ) Combining Eqs . ( 15 ) and ( 18 ) gives the joint in - and out - degree distribution n ij = γ Γ ( i + λ ) Γ ( j + µ ) Γ ( i + j ) Γ ( i + 1 ) Γ ( j ) Γ ( i + j + 2 λ + 1 ) . ( 19 ) In analogy to Eq . ( 12 ) , this joint distribution reduces to n ij = γ i λ − 1 j µ ( i + j ) 2 λ + 1 . ( 20 ) in the limit i → ∞ and j → ∞ . Another manifestation of the correlation in the degree distribution becomes evident by ﬁxing the in - degree i and allowing the out - degree j to vary . We ﬁnd that n ij reaches a maximum value when j = iµ / [ 2 + ( 1 + p ) λ ] ( here we consider large i and assume that µ > 0 ) . Corre - spondingly , the average out - degree always scales linearly with the in - degree , h j i = i ( µ + 1 ) / [ ( 1 + p ) λ ] ( here the co - eﬃcient is always positive ) . Thus popular nodes – those with large in - degree – also tend to have large out - degrees . A dual property also holds : Nodes with large out - degree – those where many links originate – also tend to be pop - ular . Let us now compare our predictions with empirical ob - servations for the world - wide web . The relevant results for the node degrees are [ 4 ] ν in ≈ 2 . 1 , ν out ≈ 2 . 7 , D in = D out ≈ 7 . 5 , ( 21 ) 3 Setting the observed value D in = D out = 7 . 5 to p − 1 ( see the discussion following Eq . ( 2 ) ) we see that the predic - tions ( 10 ) – ( 11 ) match the observed values of the in - and out - degree exponents when λ = 0 . 75 and µ = 3 . 55 , re - spectively . With these parameter values we also have ξ in ≈ 5 . 0 and ξ out ≈ 3 . 9 . Empirical measurements of these exponents would provide a deﬁnitive test of our model . We have also investigated a simpliﬁed model with node creation rate A i = i + λ , as above , but with link creation rate C ( j , i ) = j + µ , which does not depend on the pop - ularity of the target node i ( linear - linear rates ) . For this model , the rate equations for the evolution of the num - ber of nodes with degrees ( i , j ) have a similar structure to Eqs . ( 4 ) and they can be solved by the same approach as that given for the network with linear - bilinear growth rates . We ﬁnd that the in - and out - degree distributions again have power - law forms . Moreover , the out - degree exponent is still given by Eq . ( 10 ) , while the value of the in - degree exponent is now ν in = 1 + λ + p − 1 . If we set p − 1 = 7 . 5 to reproduce the correct average degree of the web graph , we see that ν in must be larger than 8 . 5 . Similarly the linear - linear model with A i = i + λ and C ( j , i ) = i + µ gives a power - law in - degree distribution but the exponential out - degree distribution O j = p 2 q j − 1 . Therefore linear - linear rate models cannot match empir - ical observations from the web . Parenthetically , we can also solve completely the grow - ing network with both constant node creation rate and constant link creation rate , A i = 1 and C ( j , i ) = 1 . While not necessarily a realistic model , it provides a useful ex - actly solvable case . By following the basic steps of the rate equation approach , we ﬁnd the joint distribution n ij = p 2 q j − 1 2 i + j Γ ( i + j ) Γ ( i + 1 ) Γ ( j ) , ( 22 ) from which we deduce the in - and out - degree distribu - tions : I i = p 2 / ( 1 + p ) i + 1 and O j = p 2 q j − 1 . Again , the in - and out - degrees of a node are correlated . In summary , we have studied a growing network model which incorporates : ( i ) node creation and immediate at - tachment to a pre - existing node , and ( ii ) link creation between pre - existing nodes . The combination of these two processes naturally leads to non - trivial in - degree and out - degree distributions . We computed many structural properties of the resulting network by solving the rate equations for the evolution of the number of nodes with given in - and out - degree . For link attachment rate lin - ear in the target node degree and also link creation rate linear in the degrees of the two end nodes , power - law in - and out - degree distributions are dynamically generated . By choosing the parameters of the growth rates in a nat - ural manner these exponents can be brought into accord with recent measurements of the web . Within this class of models , the linear - bilinear growth rates appears to be a viable candidate for describing the link structure of the web graph . The model also predicts power - law behav - ior when e . g . , the in - degree is ﬁxed and the out - degree varies . Signiﬁcant correlations between the in - and out - degrees of a node develop spontaneously , in agreement with everyday experience . Quantitative measurements of correlations in the web graph would test our model and help construct a more realistic model of the world - wide web .
