( C ) Cim3 - 1 mutant strains containing either pGAL - Myc - CSE4 ( Myc - WT , SBY3735 ) or pGAL - Myc - CSE416R ( Myc - 16R , SBY3736 ) were grown as described in ( B ) . Cse4 was immunoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibod - ies and immunoblotted with either anti - Myc or anti - ubiquitin antibodies . The ubiquitin conjugates on the wild - type protein are not detected on Myc - Cse4 16R . ( D ) Myc - Cse4 ( SBY3570 ) or Myc - Cse4 16R ( SBY3571 ) were grown at 30 (cid:1) C in galactose for 2 hr , and cycloheximide was added . Ly - sate immunoblots prepared at the various time points ( min ) with anti - Myc antibodies show that the Myc - Cse4 16R mutant is more stable than wild - type Cse4 but is still de - graded . The relative amount of Cse4 at each time point was quantified and normalized to tubulin levels and is indicated under each lane . Tubulin ( Tub1 ) is shown as a loading control in ( A ) and ( D ) . that the tag did not alter the stability ( data not shown ) . of a proteolysis defect . This suggests that proteolysis prevents Cse4 from euchromatic localization . The stability of Myc - Cse4 and Myc - Cse4 16R in rad53 mu - tant cells was the same as in wild - type cells ( see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article Cse4 - 351 Is a Stable , Dominant Lethal Mutant online ) , indicating that Rad53 does not regulate CenH3 that Localizes to Euchromatin levels as it regulates the canonical histones .

The Myc - Cse4 16R was surprising because Cse4 localization Cse4 - 351 mutant was completely stable , resulting in is normally restricted to the centromere . We therefore extremely high protein levels ( Figure 3A ) .

Overexpression of CSE4 - 351 was toxic to wild - type However , Myc - Cse4 16R overexpression led to overall nu - cells ( Figure 3B ) .

There - whereas 21 % of wild - type cells did .

However , the expression of CSE4 - to euchromatin when the levels are increased because Current Biology 1970 in glucose or galactose media , and ChIP was performed ( Figure 3E ) . Whereas wild - type Cse4 was only detected at the centromere , the Cse4 - 351 protein was detected at the nonspecific euchromatin loci PGK1 , HMR , and TEL6 , supporting the conclusion that maintaining low levels of Cse4 prevents euchromatin localization . Centromere Bound Cse4 Is Stable Our discovery that Cse4 is degraded led us to question whether centromere bound Cse4 is also unstable . To analyze Cse4 stability at the centromere , we added cycloheximide to wild - type cells for 60 min , and Cse4 localization was assayed by ChIP . Although the majority of Cse4 was degraded , Cse4 was still detected at the centromere by ChIP ( data not shown ) . To further test Cse4 stability at the centromere , we fused Cse4 to the N - degron sequence to allow it to be targeted for degra - dation [ 14 ] . Transcription of the degron - CSE4 gene is repressed by doxycycline , and the protein is targeted for ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis by the N - end rule . When the overexpressed degron - CSE4 gene was the solecopyof CSE4 inthecell , itwasfunctionalforgrowth . Although the degron - Cse4 protein was not detectable on an immunoblot 30 min after doxycycline addition ( Figure 4A ) , Cse4 was still centromere bound up to 2 hr Figure 2 .
