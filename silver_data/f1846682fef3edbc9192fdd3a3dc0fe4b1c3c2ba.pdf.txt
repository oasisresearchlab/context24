Lajoie 1 * , Gaurav Jain 1 & Job Dekker 1 The vast non - coding portion of the human genome is full of functional elements and disease - causing regulatory variants . The principles defining the relationships between these elements and distal target genes remain unknown . Promoters and distal ele - ments canengage in looping interactions that have been implicated in gene regulation 1 . Here we have applied chromosome conforma - tion capture carbon copy ( 5C 2 ) to interrogate comprehensively interactions between transcription start sites ( TSSs ) and distal ele - ments in 1 % of the human genome representing the ENCODE pilot project regions 3 . 5C maps were generated for GM12878 , K562 and HeLa - S3 cells and results were integrated with data from the ENCODE consortium 4 . In each cell line we discovered . 1 , 000 long - range interactions between promoters and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers , promoters and CTCF - bound sites . We observed significant correlations between gene expression , promoter – enhancer interactions and the presence of enhancer RNAs . Long - range interactions show marked asymmetry with a bias for interactions with elements located 120 kilobases upstreamof theTSS . Long - range interactions are oftennot blocked by sites bound by CTCF and cohesin , indicating that many of these sites do not demarcate physically insulated gene domains . Furthermore , only 7 % of looping interactions are with the nearest gene , indicating that genomic proximity is not a simple predictor for long - range interactions . Finally , promoters and distal elements are engaged in multiple long - range interactions to form complex networks . Our results start to place genes and regulatory elements in three - dimensional context , revealing their functional relationships . Spatial proximity and specific long - range interactions between genomic elements can be detected using chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) - based methods 5 . Previous studies have been limited to analysis of single loci 5 – 8 , interactions that involve a single protein of interest 9 , or to analysis of genome - wide folding of chromosomes at a resolution that cannot detect specific looping interactions between genes and functional elements 10 . To overcome these limitations we previously developed 5C ( ref . 2 ) . 5C is a high - throughput adaptation of 3C and uses pools of reverse and forward 5C primers to detect long - range interactions between two targeted sets of genomic loci , for example , promoters and distal gene regulatory elements in this study . By targeting a specific part of the genome , 5C facilitates detection of interactions at single restriction fragment resolution . To begin to define the principles of long - range gene regulation in thehumangenomewehaveused5Ctomapinteractionssystematicallybetweenpromotersanddistalelementsthroughoutthe44ENCODEpilotprojectregionsrepresenting1 % ( 30megabases ( Mb ) , Sup - plementary Table 1 ) of the genome in three cell lines ( Fig . 1a ) . The ENCODE regions , ranging in size from 500kilobases ( kb ) to 1 . 9Mb , were selected for comprehensive annotation by the ENCODE pilot project 11 . Here we analysed interactions between 628 TSS - containing restriction fragments and4 , 535‘distal’restric - tion fragments covering the ENCODE regions ( Fig . 1aandSupplemen - tary Tables 2 and 3 ; see also Methods ) . 5C libraries were generated for two biological replicates of GM12878 , K562 and HeLa - S3 ( Supplementary Tables 4 – 6 ) . These cell lines are extensively annotated by the ENCODE consortium 3 , 4 . 5C interaction frequencies measured between ENCODE regions located on different chromosomes were used to quantify minor variations in interaction detection efficiencies due to technical biases related to 5C primer efficiency , restriction fragment length , or digestion efficiency . 5C interaction frequencies were then corrected for these biases ( Methods and Supplementary Data ) . An example of a 5C long - range interaction map representing TSS – distal fragment interactions along and between 14 ENCODE regions ( ENm001 – ENm014 ) is shown in Fig . 1b . 5C detects known general features of spatial chromatin organization . First , interactions within the same ENCODE region are more frequent than those between different ENCODE regions . Within one ENCODE region interaction frequencies are generally higher for pairs of loci located closer together in the linear genome . This inverse relationship between genomic distance and interaction frequency isas expected for a flexible chromatin fibre 5 , 12 . Second , interactions between ENCODE regions that are located on the same chromosome are more frequent than interactions between regions located on different chromosomes ( arrow in Fig . 1b ) . This is consistent with 4C and Hi - C analyses 6 , 10 , and is due to the formation of spatially separated chromosome territories . 5C data sets were analysed toidentifyTSS – distal fragment pairs that interact more frequently than expected , indicating that they are rela - tively close in space . For each biological replicate we independently determined the average relationship between interaction frequency and genomic distance ( solid red lines in Fig . 1c , d ) . We defined this as the expected interaction frequency . Next we identified interactions that occur significantly more frequently than expected for loci sepa - rated by a corresponding genomic distance by transforming 5C signals into a z - score ( false discovery rate ( FDR ) 5 1 % ; Methods ) . Specific long - range interactions are then defined as pairs of loci that interact significantly more frequently than expected in both replicates . By excluding interactions that are significant in only one replicate , we estimate that only around 10 – 18 % of the significant long - range inter - actions identified by our approach might be false positives , as esti - mated from analysis of interactions in gene desert ENCODE regions ( ENr112 , ENr113 and ENr313 ) where no significant long - range inter - actions were expected ( Methods ) . This application of stringent thresh - olds probably leads to a higher false - negative rate . Consistently , interaction frequencies that are found to be significant in only one replicate are still significantly elevated in the other replicate as * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 PrograminSystemsBiology , PrograminGeneFunctionandExpression , DepartmentofBiochemistryandMolecularPharmacology , UniversityofMassachusettsMedicalSchool , 364PlantationStreet , Worcester , Massachusetts01605 - 0103 , USA .

Our analysis correctly identified known interactions between TSSs and their cognate distal regulatory elements , providing validation of the approach ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . As an example , Fig . 1d shows the 5C interaction profile in K562 cells for a TSS located in the b - globin locus . We previously found that this TSS located just downstream of the c - globin genes displayed prominent looping interactions with the distal locus control region ( LCR ) in K562 cells 2 . Our analysis accurately detected these looping interactions ( HS3 , HS4 and HS5 ) . We identified additional known long - range interactions with DNase I hypersensitive sites ( DHSs ) near distal CTCF - bound elements ( 3 9 HS1 and HS - 111 ) 2 , 13 , 14 . In K562 cells we also detected the known interac - tions between the c - globin gene ( HBG1 ) and the LCR ( HS5 ) and between the a - globin genes and three distal regulatory elements including the a - globin enhancer HS40 , and two CTCF - bound elements ( HS46 and HS10 ) , located 40 , 46 and 10kb upstream of the genes , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and refs 15 , 16 ) . The importance of these distal elements in regulating globin gene expression through looping has been extensively documented 14 , 16 . As expected , these looping interactions in the globin loci were not detected in GM12878 or HeLa - S3 cells that express little or no globin ( SupplementaryFig . 3 ) . Additionalexamplesofcell - type - specificTSS – distal element interactions are shown in Supplementary Fig . 4 . Furthermore , 5C interaction frequencies are correlated with TSS – distal DHS pairs predicted to be functionally connected based on their highly correlated activity across a large panel of cell lines ( P , 10 2 13 , one - sided Mann – Whitney U - test 17 ) , providing independent valid - ation of their biological significance . In each cell line we identified large numbers of statistically signifi - cant TSS – distal fragment interactions , of which , 60 % were observed in only one of the three cell lines ( Fig . 2a ) . These data point to intricate cell - type - specific three - dimensional folding of chromatin . 3C - based assays detect specific and functional interactions , for example , TSSs with gene regulatory elements 8 . In addition , the assay will detect‘struc - tural’ interactions , for example , close spatial proximity as a result of other nearby specific looping interactions ( bystander interactions ) or overall higher order folding of the chromatin fibre . To determine which looping interactions involved distal sites that displayed specific chromatin features associated with functional elements , we compared our data with data sets generated by the ENCODE consortium ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Table 7 ) . We found that looping interactions in all cell lines were significantly enriched for distal fragments that are bound by CTCF—a protein known to mediate DNA looping 18 — contain open chromatin ( as determined by FAIRE 19 or DHS mapping 17 ) , and / or contain histones with modifications that are char - acteristic for active functional elements ( H3K4me1 , H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 ) . Long - range interactions are also enriched for H3K9ac and H3K27ac , but are not enriched or significantly depleted for H3K27me3 , a mark typically found at inactive or closed chromatin . To gain more insight into the types of element present in the distal looping fragments , we made use of genome - wide and cell - line - specific segmentation analyses that identified seven distinct chromatin states based on histone modifications , the presence of DHSs and the localization of proteins such as RNA polymerase II and CTCF ( ref . 4 and Fig . 2b ) . These states are : ( 1 ) enhancer ( E ) ; ( 2 ) weak enhancer ( WE ) ; ( 3 ) TSS ; ( 4 ) predicted promoter flanking regions ( PF ) ; ( 5 ) insulator element ( CTCF ) ; ( 6 ) predicted repressed region ( R ) ; and ( 7 ) predicted transcribed region ( T ) . The ENCODE consortium tested sets of the E elements in enhancer assays and confirmed that . 50 % display enhancer activity 4 . We found that looping interactions were significantly enriched for distal fragments that contained E , WE and CTCF elements , and the actively transcribed chromatin state ( T ) , but weredepletedfortherepressedchromatinstate ( R ) . Wenotethatsome distal looping fragments contained elements classified as TSS or PF , eventhoughtheydidnotcontainTSSsasdefinedbytheGENCODEv7 annotation 20 . Possibly , these are yet - to - be - annotated TSSs . Next , we used the seven - way segmentation data to categorize looping interactions into four broader functional groups ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . 5 and Supplementary Data ) : those that involve a distal fragment that contains a putative enhancer ( ‘E’ ( E or WE ) ) , a putative promoter ( ‘P’ ( TSS or PF ) ) , or a CTCF - bound element a Experimental design b 0 80 Distal fragments T SS 001 008 007 006 005 004 003 002 009010 011 012 013 014 ENm TSS Distal fragments HindIII d 4 . 8 5 . 0 5 . 2 5 . 4 5 . 6 Genomic position on chr11 ( Mb ) 5 C c o un t s ( × 10 2 ) γ - δ globin profile ACSL6 profile DHS 1kb from 3 ′ HS1 DHS Pu . 1 HS3HS4HS5 ( CTCF ) HS - 111 ( CTCF ) DHS ( CTCF ) c Genomic position on chr5 ( Mb ) 5 C c o un t s ( × 10 2 ) RT CTCF PFTSS EWE K562 131 . 4 131 . 6 131 . 8 132 . 2 132 . 0 GM12878 CTCF 25 20 15 10 5 0 20 15 10 5 0 HBB HBD HBG Figure 1 | 5C approach to identify looping interactions . a , 5C design 28 .

The final class contains interactions with fragments that do not contain any of these three types of element , although they do contain T and R states ( ‘U’ , unclassified ) . The last class is relatively large but is still significantly enriched in features that are characteristic for active functional elements such as H3K4me1 , and over 60 % of the unclassified fragments contain chromatin features found at active chromatinelements ( SupplementaryFig . 7 ) . Thus , thesearenotsimply noise or false positives , but are probably the result of the conservative segmentation approach . We found that TSS – E and TSS – P interactions are more cell - type specific than TSS – CTCF interactions : for the TSS – E and TSS – P categories , the ratio of interactions that is seen in only one cell line versus morethanonecelllineis , 4 : 1 , whereas itiscloseto , 1 : 1forthe TSS – CTCF category ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . The cell - type - specific activity of some of these E elements was confirmed using transient reporter assays ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Next , we determined whether looping of a TSS to any of the four categories of chromatin states is correlated with transcription . We used CAGE expression data 21 to assign an expression level to each TSS . We found that looping interactions with fragments containing enhancer - like E elements were significantly enriched for those that involved expressed TSSs ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In addition , the subset of TSSs that interact with fragments containing E elements was significantly more highly expressed compared to TSSs that do not interact with E elements . Interactions with other classes of element ( CTCF , P and U ) are sig - nificantlyenrichedforactivelyexpressedgenesinsome , butnotall , cell lines ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Active enhancers often express enhancer RNAs 22 . We used a comprehensive enhancer RNA data set generated by the ENCODE consortium to determine whether TSSs preferentially interact with active enhancer - like elements 23 . We found that E elements that are loopingto TSSsaresignificantly more likelytoexpress enhancerRNAs than E elements that are not looping ( P , 5 3 10 2 5 , hypergeometric test , Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . We conclude that looping interactions preferentially involve active enhancer - like elements . Next we analysed the distribution of long - range interactions upstream and downstream of TSSs . To generate this landscape of looping interactions we aligned all TSSs and calculated the average number of interactions that a TSS has with each class of distal element at increasing genomic distances upstream and downstream of the TSS . Figure 3a shows the resulting average long - range interaction profile across all three cell lines ( similar results were obtained when each of the cell lines was analysed separately ; Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Notably , we found that the long - range interaction landscape is asymmetric , with interactions of E , P and CTCF classes peaking around 120kb upstream of the TSS . This asymmetry of interactions reveals an unanticipated directionality in long - range interactions with TSSs . This may indicate the presence of topological constraints imposed by the mechanism by which such interactions regulate target promoters . No such bias was observed for the set of unclassified elements , or for the complete set of interrogated interactions ( Fig . 3a ) . Interestingly , previous analyses showed that conserved non - coding elements are also often found within similar distances of target genes 24 . Third , when we analysed expressed TSSs and non - expressed TSSs separately , we found that both have a similar interaction landscape but that expressed TSSs tend to have more inter - actions , especially with the E , P and CTCF classes . We cannot rule out the possibility that some TSSs classified as non - expressed based on the absence of CAGE tags are actually expressed at low levels . Next we explored whether the relative order of elements in the gen - ome affects which long - range interactions occur . It is often assumed thatdistalelementssuchasenhancerstargetthenearestTSS . Only , 7 % of the looping interactions are between an element and the nearest TSS ( Fig . 3b ) . This number goes up to 22 % when only active TSSs are included . Similarly , 27 % of the distal elements have an interaction with the nearest TSS , and 47 % of elements have interactions with the nearest expressed TSS . Thus , when predicting TSS – distal element interactions , choosing the nearest ( active ) gene is often not correct . It has been suggested that CTCF sites located between an enhancer and a TSS may prevent enhancer – promoter interactions 18 , 25 , although in individual cases interactions over such sites have been observed 14 , 26 .

All rights reserved ©2012 To address this question we determined the frequency of identified long - range interactions between a TSS and a distal element that skip over one or more sites bound by CTCF . We found that 79 % of long - range interactions are unimpeded by the presence of one or more CTCF - bound sites ( Fig . 3c ) . Thus , the presence of a CTCF - bound site does not block physical long - range interactions . It has been reported that CTCF acts in conjunction with the cohesin complex to block promoter – enhancer interactions 27 . We found that 58 % of looping interactions skip sites co - bound by CTCF and cohesin ( Fig . 3c ) . We obtained similar results when the different categories of long - range interaction ( TSS – E , TSS – P , TSS – CTCF and TSS – U ) were analysed separately . Possibly , additional factors need to be recruited to CTCF - bound sites to acquire interaction - blocking activity . The large number of long - range interactions that we discovered indicate that distal elements and TSSs are each engaged in multiple long - range interactions . To characterize this phenomenon in more detail we determined the interaction degree of TSSs and distal frag - ments . We found that , 50 % of TSSs display one or more long - range interaction , with some interacting with as many as 20 distal fragments ( Fig . 4a ) . Expressed TSSs interact with slightly more fragments as com - pared to non - expressed TSSs ( the mean for GM12878 is 1 . 88 versus 1 . 37 , or 3 . 88 versus 3 . 25 when including only those TSSs with at least one interaction ) . Out of all distal fragments interrogated , , 10 % inter - acted with one or more TSS , with some interacting with more than 10 ( mean of 2 . 15 ( for GM12878 ) when including only those distal frag - ments with at least one interaction ) . The degree distribution of the four categories of distal elements was very similar ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Figure 4b shows an example of the complex long - range interaction networks formed by TSSs and distalfragments in the ENr132region in K562 cells . Itisunlikelythattheseinteractionscanalloccur atthesame time in the same cell , which is indicative of significant cell - to - cell variation . The data indicate that gene – element interactions are not exclusively one - to - one , and suggest that multiple genes and distal elements can assemble in larger clusters , as proposed for the b - globin locus 14 . Ourdata providenewinsightsintothelandscapeofchromatin loop - ing that bring genes and distant elements in close spatial proximity . In addition to generating a rich data set reflecting specific gene – element interactions , the average interaction profile of TSSs with surrounding chromatin reveals several general principles regarding the asymmetric relationships between genomic distance , the order of elements , and the formation of looping interactions . The bias for upstream interactions may indicate that the protein complexes on many TSSs may be asymmetric and may preferentially interact on one side with enhancer – protein complexes . It is also possible that the asymmetry of the long - range interaction landscape reflects a potential preference of looping to elements that are located in intergenic non - transcribed regions . Furthermore , although these average long - range interaction landscapes may facilitate computational prediction of long - range interactions throughout the genome , the fact that interactions skip genes and CTCF / cohesin sites indicates that additional mechanisms for target selection and gene insulation exist .

With further development of 3C technology and increases in sequencing capacity , similar high - resolution studies should become feasible to map specific long - range interactions throughout the genome , which may uncover additional principles that guide chromatin looping . Such insights will also be critical for interpreting genome - wide association studies that often identify regions with regulatory elements but not their distally located target genes . Co - published ENCODE - related papers can be explored online via the Nature ENCODE explorer ( http : / / www . nature . com / ENCODE ) , a specially designed visualization tool that allows users to access the linked papers and investigate topics that are discussed in multiple papers via thematically organized threads . METHODS SUMMARY 5C wasperformed using twopools of 5Cprimers : one for ENm001 – ENm014and ENr313 , and one pool for all 30 randomly picked ENCODE regions ( ENr111 – ENr334 ) 11 ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ) . 5C libraries ( two biological replicates per cell line ) were sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx platform and sequence reads were mapped using Novoalign ( http : / / www . novocraft . com ) , as described 15 . Interaction data for each experiment are available in GEO ( accession number GSE39510 ) . Statistically significant pair - wise interactions were identified ( Methods ) by converting each 5C signal into a z - score using theaverage 5Csignal distribution versus genomic distance as a background estimate . Significant inter - actions ( 1 % FDR ) observed in both biological replicates were considered looping interactions . 5C looping interactions were compared to a variety of genome - wide data sets generated by the ENCODE consortium 4 ( Supplementary Table 7 ) .

All rights reserved ©2012 METHODS Cell growth conditions . GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells were procured from Coriell Cell Repositories and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2mM L - glutamine , 15 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and antibiotic ( 1 % penicillin – streptomycin ) . K562 ( CCL - 243 ) , a CML cell line , and HeLa - S3 ( CCL2 . 2 ) , a cervical carcinoma cell line , were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . K562 cells were cultured in similar media as GM12878 cells except with 10 % FBS , whereas HeLa - S3 cells were maintained in ATCC recommended F - 12K medium ( Kaighn’s modification of Ham’s F - 12 medium ) with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin – streptomycin . The culture densities and condi - tions were maintained as per recommendations of the repositories . Formaldehyde crosslinking . For suspension cells ( GM12878 , K562 ) a total of 1 3 10 8 freshly growing cells were centrifuged at 100 g for 5min . Cell pellets were re - suspended in 45ml of respective growth medium in a 50 - ml Falcon tube . Cells were fixed by addition of 1 . 25ml of 37 % formaldehyde ( final concentration of formaldehyde 1 % ) . The cell suspension was gently mixed by invertingthe tube up anddown4 – 6timesatroomtemperatureandthetubeswererotatedonanend - to - end shaker for exactly 10min . Crosslinking was stopped by addition of 2 . 5M glycine ( finalconcentration125mM ) andcellsuspensionswereincubatedatroom temperature for 15min using an end - to - end shaker . The crosslinked cells were then pelleted at 100 g for 5min and the cell pellet was stored at 2 80 u C . For HeLa - S3 cells , the adherent cells were first trypsinized and then the crosslinking was performed as described above . 5C analysis . 5C analysis was carried out as previously described 2 , 15 for the 44 ENCODE Pilot regions ( ENCODE manual ( ENm ) and ENCODE random ( ENr ) ) . The chromosomal position and coordinates of the regions as per the February 2009 GRCh37 / hg19 human genome assembly are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . The 5C experiment is designed to interrogate looping interactionsbetweenHindIIIfragmentscontainingtranscriptionstartsites ( TSSs ) and any other HindIII restriction fragment ( distal fragments ) in the ENCODE pilot regions . 5C primer design . 5C primers were designed at HindIII restriction sites ( AAGCTT ) using5Cprimerdesigntoolspreviouslydevelopedandmadeavailable online at My5C website ( http : / / my5C . umassmed . edu ) 28 . Reverse 5C primers were designed for HindIII restriction fragments overlapping a known TSS from GENCODE transcripts , or overlapping a start site as experimentally determined byCAGEtagdataoftheENCODEpilotproject ( SupplementaryTable2 ) . Forward 5C primers were designed for the remaining HindIII restriction fragments ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . For ENCODE regions that do not contain any TSS according to gene annotation in 2008 ( ENr112 , ENr113 , ENr311 and ENr313 ) , we used an alternative primer design . For these regions an alternating design of forward and reverse 5C primers was used in which forward and reverse primers are designed for alternating restriction fragments 2 . Note that ENr311 contains genes according to 2011 GENCODE v7 annotation 20 . Primers were excluded for highly repetitive sequences that prevented the design of a sufficiently unique 5C primer . Primers settings were as described before 15 : U - BLAST , 3 ; S - BLAST , 130 ; 15 - MER , 1 , 320 ; MIN _ FSIZE , 40 ; MAX _ FSIZE , 50 , 000 ; OPT _ TM , 65 ; OPT _ PSIZE , 40 . The 5C primers contained up to 40 bases that were specific for the corresponding restriction fragment . If a shorter sequence was sufficient to obtainapredictedannealingtemperatureof65 u C , thatshortersequencewasused , andrandomsequencewasadded tomake a totalof40bases . Allof the 5Cprimers have an extension of universal tail sequences at the 5 9 end for forward 5C primers and at the 3 9 end for reverse 5C primers . DNA sequence of the universal tails of forward primers was 5 9 - CCTCTCTATGGGCAGTCGGTGAT - 3 9 ; DNA sequence for the universal tails of reverse primers was 5 9 - AGAGAATGAGG AACCCGGGGCAG - 3 9 . A six - base barcode was included between the specific sequence of the primers and the universal tail to aid in mapping of the high - throughput short sequencing reads . The length of each primer was 69bp . In total , 981 reverse primers and 5 , 321 forward primers were designed ( corresponding to , 77 . 1 % ( 6 , 302 of 8 , 174 ) of all HindIII fragments in the 44 ENCODE regions ) . Generationof5Clibraries . 3CwasperformedwithHindIIIrestrictionenzymeas previously described 15 , 29 for GM12878 , K562 and HeLa - S3 cells separately with two biological replicates for each cell line . The 3C libraries were then interrogated by 5C . The 44 ENCODE regions were analysed in two groups using two separate 5Cprimerpools . Thefirstgroup ( ENm ) containedthemanuallypickedENCODE regions ENm001 – ENm014 and ENr313 . The second group ( ENr ) contained the 30 randomly picked ENCODE regions . The two 5C primer pools were made by pooling 5C primers for interrogating long - range interactions in the two groups of ENCODE regions . In these pools each primer was present at a final concentration of 0 . 5fmol m l 2 1 . The primer pool for the ENm group contained a total of 3 , 150 primers ( 476 reverse 5C primers and 2 , 674 forward 5C primers ) . This primer pool allows interrogation of a total of 1 , 272 , 824 interactions . Of these , 83 , 427 interactions were between fragments that were both located in the same ENCODE region . The primerpool for the ENr group containeda totalof 3 , 152primers ( 505 reverse 5Cprimers and2 , 647forward 5Cprimers ) . This primerpool allowsinterrogation of a total of 1 , 336 , 735 interactions . Of these , 34 , 859 interactions were between fragments that were both located in the same ENCODE region . 5C was performed in 10 – 15 reactions each containing an amount of 3C library that represents 200 , 000 genome equivalents and 0 . 5 fmol of each primer . The multiplex annealing reaction was performed overnight at 55 u C . Pairs of annealed 5C primers were ligated at the same temperature using Taq DNA ligase for 1h . Ligated 5C primer pairs , which represent a specific ligation junction in the 3C libraryandthusalong - rangeinteractionbetweenthetwocorrespondingloci , were thenamplifiedusing28cyclesofPCRwithuniversaltailprimersthatrecognizethecommontailsofthe5Cforwardandreverseprimers . At least four separate amp - lification reactions were carried out for each of 10 – 15 annealing reactions described above and all the PCR products were pooled together . This pool con - stitutes the 5C library . The libraries were concentrated using Qiaquick PCR puri - fication kit and a 3 9 - A tailing reaction was done using dATP and Taq DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 3 standard Taq buffer ( NEB ) at 72 u C for 30min . To facilitate Illumina paired - end DNA sequence analysis of 5C libraries , Illumina paired - end adaptor oligonucleotides ( Illumina ) were ligated to the 5C library usingthe IlluminaPEprotocol . The linkered 5Clibrarywasthenamplified by PCR ( 17 or 18 cycles , with Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase ) using Illumina PCR primer PE 1 . 0 and 2 . 0 . The 5C library was gel purified and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform , generating 36 - bp paired - end reads . 5C read mapping . Sequencing data was obtained from an Illumina GAIIx machine and was processed through a custom pipeline to map and assemble 5C interactions . We used 36 - bp paired - end reads to sequence all 5C libraries . Owing tosequencingefficiency , some5Clibrarieswerere - sequencedasmanyastentimes to obtain the required read depth for our analysis . The fastQ files were taken directly from the Illumina GAIIx and fed into our in - house5Cmappingpipeline . Eachsideofthepairedendreadwasindependently mapped to a pseudo - genome of all possible 5C primer sequences using the novoalign mapping algorithm ( V2 . 05 http : / / novocraft . com ) . The default align - ment settings for novoalign were used . After mapping , if both of the paired - end reads could be uniquely mapped to a 5C primer , a 5C interaction was assembled . Invalidinteractionsbetweenthesame primerorbetweenprimersofthe sametype were removed asthesewould representa mappingartefactor an issuewith the5C technique . The number of invalid interactions detected across all libraries was , 0 . 01 % , which would be expected if solely due to random mapping errors . Statistics regardingthe5Clibrary quality , mapping efficiency , etc . canbe found inSupplementaryTable4 . Becauseitisonlynecessarytomapthepaired - endreads to the list of all possible 5C primers rather than to the entire genome , a higher percentage of mapped / usable reads can be achieved . We found that . 90 % of all paired - end reads ( after Illumina chastity filtering ) can be uniquely mapped to a single 5C interaction . For libraries where more than one lane was used to achieve adequate sequence depth , the interactions from each lane were summed to pro - duce the complete 5C interaction data set . A table summarizing the read depth of each 5C library can be found in Supplementary Table 5 . Pearson correlation coefficients between the biological replicates can be found in Supplementary Table 6 . Detection bias correction . 5C experiments involve a number of steps that can locally differ in efficiency , thereby introducing biases in efficiency of detection of pairs of interactions . These biases could be due to differences in the efficiency of crosslinking , the efficiency of restriction digestion ( related to crosslinking effi - ciency ) , the efficiency of ligation ( related to fragment size ) , the efficiency of 5C primers ( related to annealing and PCR amplification ) and finally the efficiency of DNA sequencing ( related to base composition ) . All of these potential biases— several of which are common to other approaches such as chromatin immuno - precipitation ( for example , crosslinking efficiency , PCR amplification , base - com - position - dependent sequencing efficiency ) —will have an impact on the overall efficiency with which long - range interactions for a given locus ( restriction frag - ment ) canbedetected . Todeterminethisoverallefficiencyofinteractiondetection wehavedevelopedthefollowinggeneralstrategy . Todetermineoverallinteraction detection efficiency for a given restriction fragment we analysed the large set of interchromosomal interactions that are detected for each fragment . We then defined the overall efficiency of interchromosomal interaction detection for a given fragment as the ratio of the average interchromosomal signal obtained with that fragment and the average interchromosomal signal of all fragments . We then corrected the frequency of each interrogated long - range intrachromosomal inter - action using a correction factor that is the product of the overall efficiency of interchromosomal interaction detection for the two interacting fragments . This procedure will correct for any of the biases in detectability of interactions foragivenlocus , aslistedabove , andwillalsoadjustforcopynumbervariationofa RESEARCH LETTER Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©2012 locus , which can vary in transformed cell lines such as K562 and HeLa - S3 cells , as these factors will also affect the level of interchromosomal interactions . Detailed primer filtering . To approximate the relative 5C signal of each restric - tion fragment interrogated in the experiment we first calculated the average 5C signal for all trans interactions ( interactions between different chromosomes ) . To remove any extreme outliers from the mean calculation ( for example , due to primer failure ) we first filtered down the distribution of 5C signals in trans for each restriction fragment by removing all signals beyond the mean 6 3 standard deviations ( s . d . ) . After calculating the filtered mean for each restriction fragment in trans , we calculated the global mean of all interchromosomal interaction frequencies . We then calculated a correction factor for each restriction fragment that would normalize its set of trans interactions to the entire set . Once the correctionfactorswerecalculated , wethencalculatedthemeanands . d . correction factor and flagged any restriction fragments requiring a correction value beyond themean 6 1 . 654s . d . Fragmentswithacorrectionfactoroutsideofthislimitwere flagged for removal as their trans signal is too above / below the expected signal by chance . Here , we assume that any variation in 5C signals detected within the trans space is due to experimental factors , differing primer efficiencies , ligation efficiencies , etc . Detailed primer correction . Oncetheoutlierfragmentsareremovedfromthe5C data set , we repeated the above - described steps to calculate the primer correction valuesrequiredtonormalizethe5Csignalsfortheremainingrestrictionfragments . Then , for each 5C interaction within an ENCODE region in the data set , we used the product of the correction factors from the two restrictions fragments involved in the interaction as the final correctionfactor to apply tothe 5Csignal . 5C signals were then either increased or decreased by the correction factor to correct for varying signals from the fragments visibility in the trans interaction space . Peak calling . To detect significant looping interactions from background looping interactions we developed an in - house ‘5C peak calling’ algorithm . We chose to call peaks in each 5C biological replicate separately and then take only the peaks that intersect across replicates as our final list of significant looping interactions . 5C signals represent the three - dimensional contact probabilities between pairs of loci . This relationship inversely scaled with genomic distance . To control properly for the varying genomic distances tested in the 5C data set , we first determined the relationship of 5C signals over genomic distance . Using a Lowess smoothing algorithm we found the weighted average and weighted s . d . ofall5Csignalsacrosstherangeofallinterrogatedgenomicdistances . Weusedthe traditional tri - cubic weighting function and an a parameter of 0 . 01 to average the closest 1 % of the 5C signals around each genomic distance . We assumed that the large majority of interactions are not significant looping interactions and thus we interpreted this weighted average as the expected 5C signal for any given genomic distance . The 5C signals were then transformed into a z - score by cal - culating the ( obs 2 exp / s . d . ) . Where the obs value is the detected 5C signal for a specific interaction , exp is the calculated weighted average of 5C signals for a specific genomic distance , and s . d . is the calculated weighted standard deviation of5Csignalsforaspecificgenomicdistance . Oncethe z - scoreswerecalculated , the distribution of z - scores was fit to a Weibull distribution . We found that the distribution of z - scores fits to the Weibull distribution with an R 2 value of . 0 . 939 for all cell lines . P values can then be mapped to each z - score and then also transformed into q values for FDR analysis . The ‘ q value’ package from R ( qvalue . cal [ siggenes ] ) was used to compute the q values for the given set of P values determined from the fit to the Weibull distribution . Using an FDR cutoff of 1 % , we selected all 5C interactions with a q value # 0 . 01 . We then took the intersection of all significant looping interactions across the two biological repli - cates as our final list of 5C looping interactions . Estimation of frequency of false - positive looping interactions . We defined a false - positive 5Clooping interactionasan interaction thatisidentifiedinthe peak calling approach described above but is due to technical biases or noise and thus does not reflect a biologically meaningful long - range interaction . To estimate the frequency by which our approach detects significant looping interactions by chance , we analysed 5C data obtained for the three ENCODE regions that are devoidofgenesandarealmostdevoidofactiveregulatoryelements ( accordingthe ENCODE seven - way segmentation 4 ) . As described above , we used an alternating 5C primer design for these regions . As a result , long - range interaction profiles are notspecificallyanchoredonanytypeofgenomicelement . Combinedwiththefact that these regions are largely devoid of any functional elements , we do not expect to detect any significant looping interactions . Thus , assessment of the number of looping interactions detected for these regions using our peak - calling pipeline provides an empirical approach to estimate the frequency by which significant looping interactions are detected by chance and thus represent false positives . Supplementary Fig . 1a shows the number of peaks detected in the three gene desert ENCODE regions ( ENr112 , ENr113andENr313 ) . We used these numbers to estimate the frequency with which we detect significant loopinginteractions by chance . For GM12878 cells we identified 17 significant looping interactions in both replicates . For these three ENCODE regions we interrogated 7 , 819 5C inter - actions . Thus , we estimate that the fraction of interrogated interactions that by chance scores as a significant long - range interaction : ( 17 / 7 , 819 ) 100 5 0 . 217 % . Assuming that this fraction is the same for the set of 82 , 545 interrogated TSS – distal element interactions throughout the ENCODE regions , we expect to detect ( 0 . 217 3 82 , 545 ) / 100 5 179false - positive loopinginteractions . Wedetected1 , 011 significant looping interactions between TSSs and distal sites in GM12878 cells , which leads us to estimate that the false - positive detection rate is around 18 % [ ( 179 / 1 , 011 ) 100 ] . Similaranalysesof5CdatafromK562andHeLa - S3cellsleadto estimates of false - positive detection rates of 10 % and 12 % , respectively , corres - ponding to 147 out of 1 , 434 and 190 out of 1 , 620 looping interactions possibly beingfalsepositives . Wenotethattheserepresentupperlimitestimates , assomeof thesignificantloopinginteractionsdetectedinthegenedesertregionsmaybereal . The false - positive detectionrateforsinglereplicatescanbecalculated inexactly the same way . We found that the fraction of significant looping interactions detected in one replicate that might be false positives ranges from 20 % to 47 % . Thus , by requiring interactions to be significant in both replicates , we greatly reduce the fraction of false - positive significant interactions ( from 20 – 47 % to 10 – 18 % of the significant interactions ) . At the same time , many of the significant interactions detected in only one replicate were not false positives , and by exclud - ing this subset of interactions from our analysis we introduce false negatives . Consistent with our interpretation that many of the peaks seen in only one rep - licaterepresentfalsenegatives , wefound that when wetake theunionof the peaks found in replicates 1 and 2 , or analyse the set of peaks obtained with individual replicates separately , all of the results that we presented remain the same : ( 1 ) enrichment for distal elements that resemble active gene regulatory elements ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) ; ( 2 ) asymmetry of the long - range interaction landscape with a peak around 120kb upstream of the TSS ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) ; ( 3 ) skipping over CTCF sites ; and ( 4 ) formation of interwoven interaction networks . The fact that all our resultscan be obtained using different peak sets ( for example , the union of two replicates , or the intersection of the replicates ) indicates that our basic findings are robust andnot very sensitive to where the threshold for peaks is placed . By focusing exclusively on the set of peaks independently detected in both replicates we are being conservative , only report the strongest signals that display the strongest enrichments for active chromatin features ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , and reduce the false - positive rate . In general we prefer false negatives over false positives . Fragment annotation . To annotate the interrogated restriction fragments , a variety of ENCODE data sets were used to check for overlap with our list of restriction fragments . A list of all used ENCODE data sets can be found in Supplementary Table 7 . Supplementary data . A zip archive containing all Supplementary Data can be found in Supplementary Information . 29 .
