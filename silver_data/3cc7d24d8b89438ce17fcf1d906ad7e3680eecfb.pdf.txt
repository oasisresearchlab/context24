Stuart , Peijun Zhang or Mark Boyce . 2 Traditionally molecular assembly pathways for viruses have been inferred from high resolution structures of stable intermediates purified in vitro , and from low resolution images of cell sections as well as from genetic approaches including conditionally lethal mutants . Here , we directly visualise a previously unsuspected ‘single shelled’ icosahedral intermediate for a mammalian orthoreovirus , in addition to the expected virions , in cryo - preserved infected cells by cryo - electron tomography of cellular lamellae 1 , 2 . Particle classification and averaging yielded structures at resolutions as high as 5 . 6 Å , sufficient to identify secondary structural elements and place known molecular structures , allowing us to produce an atomic model of the intermediate , comprising 120 copies of protein l 1 and 120 copies of s 2 . This l 1 shell is in a ‘collapsed’ form compared to the mature virions , with the molecules pushed inwards at the icosahedral 5 - folds by ~ 100 Å . This grossly indented shell , although produced by a mammalian reovirus , is reminiscent of the first assembly intermediate of prokaryotic dsRNA viruses belonging to a different virus family 3 , adding weight to the supposition that these diverse viruses share a common ancestor , and suggesting mechanisms for the assembly of viruses of the Reoviridae . Such methodology holds enormous promise for the dissection of the replication cycle of many viruses . Orthoreoviruses belong to a large family of viruses , the Reoviridae , which infect vertebrate , invertebrate and plant hosts and are responsible for economically and medically important diseases 4 . The mature virus particles are ~ 850 Å in diameter and are approximately spherical , with icosahedral symmetry . The particles harbour 10 separate genome segments and comprise two principle protein layers , the innermost composed of 120 copies of protein l 1 clamped together by 150 copies of σ 2 ( viral polymerases , l 3 , are attached inside adjacent to the icosahedral 5 - fold axes ) . The outer layer consists of 600 copies each of µ1 and σ 3 . The 3 array of µ1 and σ 3 is interrupted at the 5 - fold axes by pentameric l 2 turrets which cap the mRNA transcripts produced by the polymerase on egress from the particle . Finally , trimers of the fibrous cell adhesion protein σ 1 emerge from the centres of the turrets . Unlike most RNA viruses these particles do not completely uncoat during cell entry , instead µ1 , σ 3 and σ 1are stripped off , maintaining in the cytoplasm a protein shell ( known as the core ) secluding the dsRNA genome from cellular pathogen recognition receptors . These particles are transcription - competent and , in the ribonucleoside triphosphate rich environment of the cytoplasm , they synthesise and extrude capped mRNAs , derived from the ten genome segments . These are translated to make the viral proteins which not only build new particles but also re - organise the volumes of the cytoplasm devoted to the manufacture of new virus ( virus factories ) . These early stages of infection are relatively more understood than the later stages of assembly and egress 5 . Single stranded gene segments are thought to interact with each other , facilitating the encapsidation of the complete viral genome 6 , but how the multi - layered particles assemble , how the RNAs and replication enzymes are incorporated , what the signal for production of double stranded gene segments is , how assembly is completed by attachment of the final proteins and how particles leave the cell remain largely open questions . The first atomic structures for particles from the Reoviridae family were determined by X - ray crystallography 7 - 10 , and advances in single particle cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) have recently yielded structures at comparable or higher resolution for several members of the family 11 - 14 . Structural information is available for two types of purified orthoreovirus particles : the intact virus ( we term similar particles that we see inside infected cells virion - like particles ) and partially disassembled transcriptionally competent cores 10 , 15 . Cryo - EM has also allowed lower symmetry structures within the particle to be deconvoluted from the 4 icosahedral structure of the protein shell , yielding insight into the spatial organisation of the polymerase and genome segments 12 , 16 , 17 . To link such atomic descriptions of stable purified particles to the sequential processes of virus assembly occurring inside infected cells , we grew MA104 cells on gold EM grids ( Methods ) and infected them with a mammalian orthoreovirus . Twelve hours post infection the grids were plunged into liquid ethane and inspected by scanning electron microscopy ( Methods and Fig 1a ) . Cells were identified and regions chosen for cutting ~ 150 - 200 nm thick lamellae using cryo - focussed ion beam ( cryo - FIB ) milling ( Methods and Fig . 1b ) , a process that preserves high resolution information 18 . Milled lamellae were then analysed by cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) and the tilt series analysed to yield three - dimensional reconstructions ( Methods , Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Video 1 ) . In total 8 tomograms were collected , with particles from the 5 best used to generate the final structures . Overall , the attrition rate for the plunge – mill – collect workflow was high , with few lamellae proving useful . At 12 hours post infection much of the cytoplasm contained viral factories crowded with virus particles enabling effective data collection even though the milling of lamellae was performed blind . A few enveloped particles were observed in some tomograms , consistent with co - infection with rotavirus , but the particles in virus factories analysed here are exclusively reovirus ( see below ) . Unexpectedly , numerous star shaped particles were observed in the virus factories in addition to particles consistent with the expected virion architecture ( Fig . 1e ) . In addition virion - like particles of two types , ‘empty’ and ‘full’ , were observed ( Fig . 1f , g ) . The ‘full’ particles presumably contain dsRNA . Particles completely contained within the lamella were picked from five tomograms and classified into categories : 242 stars , 10 full and 65 empty virion - like particles ( Methods ) . These classes were then subjected to sub - tomogram alignment and averaging , applying icosahedral symmetry , initially using PEET and subsequently emClarity 19 ( Methods , Extended Data Table 1 ) . Maps for the three categories are shown in Fig . 2a - c , Extended Data 5 Fig . 1 and Supplementary Videos 2 & 3 . The two virion - like particles are extremely similar , with the exception that the density level is much higher in the interior of the full particles ( Fig . 2b , c and Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . An accumulation of empty particles consistent with our observations has been reported for certain reovirus strains 20 . Higher resolution analysis , allowing for deviations from exact icosahedral symmetry , was then performed ( Extended Data Table 1 ) . For stars , analysis focused on the 5 - fold regions using emClarity 19 ( Methods ) yielded a reconstruction at 6 . 6 Å . For the empty virion - like particles , reconstructions focused on the 5 - fold regions and pseudo 6 - fold regions yielded reconstructions at 6 . 5 and 5 . 6 Å respectively ( Methods , Extended Data Figs . 3 & 4a ) . The virion - like structures can be directly compared to known structures of purified virions 10 , 15 , which fit the density for the in situ structures extremely well ( CCs for main chain 0 . 76 and 0 . 78 for the 5 - fold and psuedo 6 - fold regions of the empty particle , example fits to various maps are shown in Fig . 2d - g , Extended Data Fig . 4b , c and analysed in Extended Data Table 2 ) . Thus purified virus particles provide a good model for the in - cell empty virion - like particle indicating that the internal RNA does not alter fundamental organisation of the structure , thus at the 5 - fold axis on the exterior of the particle , there is evidence for the s 1 spike being attached ( Fig . 2d ) . Although there is essentially no RNA in these empty particles there is evidence that the l 3 polymerase is attached at the expected position to the interior of l 1 close to the 5 - fold axis ( Fig . 2d and Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . However there is no evidence for the lattice - work organisation of the N - terminal 181 residues of l 1 B subunits on the inside of the particle which has been assumed to play a role in organising their assembly around the 3 - fold axes 10 , indeed there is no evidence for ordered structure for the first 259 residues of the B subunit ( in the A subunit there is density for residue 241 onwards ) . It is possible that these termini play a role in interactions with , and possibly organising , the genome in the mature virus . 6 The star shaped icosahedral particles comprise 120 major proteins ( Fig . 2h , i ) with additional density features on the outside . Since the inner shell of the virion - like particle is composed of 120 copies of l 1 we modelled these molecules into the density , initially fitting them as rigid bodies and then using Namdinator for molecular dynamics flexible fitting 21 ( Methods ) . The quality of the fit was convincing , with principle secondary structural elements occupying strong density features ( Fig . 2i ) and the correlation between model ( main chain ) and experimental density increasing from 0 . 50 ( single rigid body per molecule ) to 0 . 79 ( the quality of the agreement can be judged from Extended Data Fig . 4d and Extended Data Table 2 ) . Unique features confirmed that these were reovirus particles ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . Broad features of the organisation of the molecules parallel the arrangement seen in the virus - five copies of l 1 ( termed A molecules ) cluster around each 5 - fold axis and five further copies of l 1 ( termed B ) , orientated in a similar fashion to the A molecules , are located 35 Å further from the 5 - fold ( Fig . 2i ) . Since the 60 copies each of the A and B molecules account for the large majority of the density for these particles we henceforth term them single - layered particles ( SLPs ) . The maximum diameter of the SLPs is very similar to the corresponding layer of virion - like particles ( Fig . 2j ) , however whilst the latter are roughly spherical the SLP is collapsed inwards at the icosahedral 5 - folds by 100 Å , to give the characteristic star shaped cross - section ( Supplementary Video 4 ) . Superposition of equivalent l 1 molecules between the virion - like particles and SLPs shows that the majority of the movement is caused by molecules A and B tipping inwards by ~ 35° ( Fig . 3a , b ) . There are also significant conformational changes within the molecules , the largest being a hinge - like flexing of two parts of the subunit ( the same hinge is used to adjust between the A and B conformations in the virus particles 7 ) . There is a 10° flex inwards of the 5 - fold adjacent part of molecule A and a similar 15° flex in molecule B ( Fig . 3a , b ) . There are also significant conformational rearrangements throughout the A and B molecules ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) 7 however , at the resolution of this analysis it would be premature to make a detailed interpretation . Due to the radically different configurations of the SLP and virion - like particle the contacts between the molecules differ markedly between the two particles . This is required to accommodate the proteins without compression towards the 5 - fold axes which are squeezed inwards in the SLP . The molecules rotate by some 35° and slide partially over each other like the blades of a camera iris . The two principle interfaces between the blades are between molecules , BA ' and AB , and there are a number of smaller interfaces , AB ' ' , BB ' , AA ' and AA ' ' ( Fig . 3c ) . The largest interfaces ( BA ' and AB ) have contact areas of roughly 4 , 400 and 4 , 000 Å 2 compared to 5 , 900 and 5 , 500 Å 2 in the virion - like particle , respectively . Interface areas are given in Extended Data Table 3 ; due to the low resolution of the analysis the values for the SLP are very approximate ( for methodology see Methods ) . Overall the contacts in the SLP are significantly weaker , with different residues involved . For the BA ' interface the iris blades are twisted such that at the tip there is a 30° rotation which allows the A ' molecule to dip inside the B molecule . In this region the interface is formed between what in the virion - like particle is part of the outer surface of A ' and the region of the B molecule which in that particle forms the inner surface . These contacts use completely different areas to those used in the expanded virion . For the AB interface the rotation of the iris blades again radically alters the interface towards the 5 - fold axes , in this case through a novel ratchet mechanism . If the A molecule is considered fixed then the change corresponds to a 45° rotation around a pivot helix in B , with the effect that a bundle of helices surrounding the pivot helix rotate by a register of one helix ( ~ 12 Å ) , analogous to gears slipping by one tooth ( Fig . 3d ) . In most cases interfaces are weakened in the SLP . However the > 90° rotation leaves the AB ' ' and AA ' ' interfaces almost unchanged ( 2 , 100 to 2 , 200 and 1 , 200 to 1 , 000 Å 2 respectively . This is achieved by tucking the 5 - fold distal end of A under the edge of the B ' ' subunit . Overall the 8 l 1 protein structure allows it to occupy two radically different configurations in the SLP / virion - like particle , but is likely not compatible with stable intermediate structures . As for the empty virion - like particles we see no trace of density for the first ~ 300 residues of either l 1 subunit , suggesting that if these residues do play a role in organising the assembly of the l 1 shell , as has been proposed 10 , then it is via a loose association consistent with both the expanded and collapsed configurations that becomes ordered when the dsRNA packs against the interior of the core . The 120 copies of l 1 are decorated with additional density at 120 sites ( Fig . 3e ) . The density is poorly defined and only the region fairly close to the l 1 shell is seen , so it is not possible to unambiguously assign it to a particular protein however the overlap between the positions of these features and the attachment points of s 2 in the virus suggests that they are s 2 10 . The relative positions of s 2 in the SLP and virus are shown in Extended Data Fig . 7 . In the virus there are 150 copies per particle , which attach at three distinct points within the icosahedral asymmetric unit . Two of these are in general positions , the other lies on the icosahedral 2 - folds . We name these three sites , 2 - fold , 3 - fold adjacent and A - hinge . In the SLP the 3 - fold adjacent site remains occupied whilst the large rotation at the 2 - fold separates the two half binding sites allowing two s 2 molecules to bind where only one can be accommodated in the expanded virion ( Fig . 3f , g ) . In contrast , the A - hinge binding site is not occupied due to the iris like movement causing the adjacent B molecule to partially occlude the site . It is known that in the virion s 2 binding on top of the l 1 layer is required for the stability of the expanded l 1 shell and it has been referred to as a clamp 10 . In the SLP it appears that s 2 only partially clamps the structure prior to expansion . There are no significant sites of unexplained density in the interior of the l 1 layer of the SLP . Thus the l 3 polymerase is either so disordered as to be invisible ( the point of attachment to 9 l 1 in the virion - like particle is a point of gross conformational change between the SLP and virion - like particle and so attachment would necessarily be different ) , or the polymerase is not present . The interior volume of the SLP is 59 % of that of the virion - like particle , thus the dsRNA genome segments cannot fit inside ( the dsRNA in the core of the Reoviridae is already at a concentration of ~ 410 mg / ml 8 ) . In addition the density level in the tomogram is far lower than that in the full virion - like particles ( Fig . 2a , c ) . It is believed that the genome is encapsidated in a single - stranded form . If single - stranded genome segments were present inside the SLPs then given the reduction in volume the density of RNA would still be 85 % of that seen in the virus and the observed density levels do not support this ( Fig . 2a , c ) . The Cystoviridae are a family of bacterial dsRNA viruses and although they are somewhat smaller and simpler than the Reoviridae ( they possess only three genome segments ) it has been proposed that they share a common ancestor 3 . The Cystoviridae have acted as a model system for understanding assembly and RNA packaging in dsRNA viruses 22 - 24 and the first stage in the assembly of these viruses is the formation of a highly indented single - layered particle 25 . There is a striking similarity between the indented SLPs of phage Phi8 ( representative of the Cystoviridae ) and reovirus ( Fig . 4 ) . In both cases the structures are collapsed at the 5 - fold axes via hinge like motions . Whilst for Phi8 the SLP clearly harbours copies of the viral polymerase , which is not seen in reovirus , in both cases the SLPs contain no genomic RNA , representing a pre - packaging state in assembly . The Cystoviridae package ssRNA genome segments into preformed SLPs , in a well - defined order which is regulated by specific interactions of the genome segments with structural features on the outside of the particle which alter as the genome segments enter and inflate the particle 24 , 26 . The observation of an analogous pre - packaging SLP structure for reovirus suggests that incorporation of ssRNA might trigger expansion and addition of the outer protein components . The mechanism for ensuring the correct set of 10 genome segments is 10 encapsidated for the Reoviridae is however very different from the Cystoviridae 22 . The far larger number of segments and the recent studies of genome segment selection in the Reoviridae indicate that the mechanism used to ensure encapsidation of a complete set of 10 genome segments includes RNA - RNA recognition between segments , possibly to form a concatamer of RNA which is then recognized for packaging 6 , 27 - 29 . If there is indeed some similarity in the assembly process , with collapsed particles being transformed into an expanded state by the recruitment of the RNA genome then the empty virion - like particles we observe would be dead - end products that have failed to package the genome . Indeed the proportion of empty virion - like particles observed is consistent with the known ~ 50 % failure rate in packaging observed in strains which do not organize their virus factories in association with cellular microtubules 20 . The observation of only the SLP and completely assembled virion - like particles suggests that the conversion from the SLP to a virus - type structure occurs through the relatively rapid addition of all the structural components of the virus . We believe that cryo - ET of suitably prepared infected cells will be a general vehicle for understanding virus replication - cycles in atomic and molecular detail , with our study already providing a reconstruction at 5 . 6 Å resolution from only 65 icosahedral particles . It is clear that further unexpected structures will be revealed which are simply not stable enough to be purified . Technical advances will optimise experimental procedures and improve resolution , and correlation with live - cell imaging and the use of mutant viruses will define the molecular context in the cell and illuminate the dynamics of the virus replication cycle . 11 Fig . 1 .

MA104 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 5 % ( v / v ) foetal bovine serum at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Mammalian orthoreovirus serotype 3 was used ( sequence deposited for L1 , S1 and S2 ) . Cell preparation for cryo - EM . Glow - discharged carbon - coated gold TEM grids ( Quantifoil R2 / 1 ) were seeded with 33 , 000 MA104 cells and allowed to adhere for 4 hours at 37°C . Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated at 37°C . At 12 hours post - infection the grids were washed 3 times in PBS , blotted from the back side for 6 to 8 s and flash frozen in liquid ethane using a manual plunger . Focused ion beam milling Milling was performed as previously described 18 . Briefly , grids were clipped into autogrid rims ( Thermo Scientific ) and loaded into a Scios DualBeam system ( Thermo Scientific ) using a Quorum cryo transfer station ( PP3010T ) and a custom built cryo stage cooled to - 165°C . Prior to milling , grids were coated with a ~ 2 µm layer platinum using the gas injection system . Milling was performed in a step - wise fashion , using a 30 - kV Ga ion beam , and beam currents of 300 pA , 100 pA , 49 pA , and 30 pA to generate a lamella with a final thickness of ~ 150 – 200 nm . Milling progress was monitored with the scanning electron microscope using 3 - 5 kV beam and 25 pA beam current . Cryo - ET data acquisition . Tilt series were collected on several positions from 3 different lamellae using a Thermo Scientific Krios electron microscope ( eBIC Krios III ) operating at 300 keV and equipped 17 with a Gatan post - column energy filter ( selecting a 20 eV window ) on a K2 Summit direct electron detector ( Gatan ) . Data acquisition was performed covering an angular range from - 40° to + 40° with 2° angular increments recorded automatically using the dose - symmetric tilting scheme 32 under low - dose conditions using SerialEM software 33 . Each tilt series was collected with a nominal defocus value between 4 . 3 and 5 . 9 µ m . Each tilt was acquired as movies ( containing 5 frames ) in counting mode using a dose of 2 e - / Å 2 per tilt . The total cumulative dose for each tilt series was 82 e - / Å 2 , with calibrated pixel size of 1 . 8 Å . Tomogram reconstruction and sub - tomogram averaging A total of eight tilt series were recorded from 3 lamellae , subjected to movie - frame alignment using Unblur 34 , but without dose weighting since this is implemented in emClarity 19 at the final sub - tomogram averaging step . Initial analysis used IMOD / PEET 31 , 35 , and these preliminary results are shown in Fig . 2a - c . For final analysis the frame - aligned tilt series were aligned and tomograms reconstructed in the framework of Appion 36 using Protomo 37 . The five tilt series of best quality ( thinner lamella , minimum ice contamination ) were selected and subjected to sub - tomogram alignment and averaging using emClarity . Tomograms were also reconstructed at binning 4 using SIRT for visualization . A total of 242 single - layered particles ( SLP ) were picked from five tomograms and were subsequently aligned and averaged . The twelve 5 - fold vertices were identified in IMOD isosurface view from the averaged particle map allowing icosahedral symmetry to be applied to the whole SLP , resulting in an averaged map of SLP at 7 . 8 Å resolution . The 5 - folds were then extracted from the symmetrized particle map and used as a reference for emClarity sub - tomogram particle picking by template matching . For emClarity processing , a total of 2 , 683 SLP 5 - folds were extracted . The 3D alignment procedures of SLP 5 - folds were carried out gradually with binning of 4 , 3 , 2 and 1 , each with 3 iterations . No manual mask was applied during the 18 refinement . Dose - weighed filtering was applied at the final step . The FSC was calculated by the gold - standard method from even and odd data sets . The resolution of the SLP 5 - folds is 6 . 6 Å at the 0 . 143 FSC cut off . The same process was carried out for a total of 65 empty virion - like particles , from those a total of 625 5 - folds and 3 , 039 pseudo 6 - folds were extracted , iteratively aligned and averaged . The resolution of these 5 - fold and pseudo 6 - fold reconstructions at the 0 . 143 FSC cut - off is 6 . 5 Å and 5 . 6 Å , respectively . A summary of cryo - electron tomography data acquisition and data processing are presented in Extended Data Table 1 . Model building , analysis and validation Models were derived from PDB 1EJ6 , 2CSE , 1JMU and 3S6X . Initial fitting was performed by placing by hand into the density followed by Chimera 38 rigid body fitting . For the virion - like particle this was followed by molecular dynamics flexible fitting implemented in Namdinator 21 , 39 . For the SLP individual proteins ( A and B ) were fitted in Chimera and then each λ 1 divided into two portions which were further rigid body fitted . Finally the fitting was optimised using Namdinator . Representative FSC curves for the fit of the models to the map are shown in Extended Data Fig . 4 . Validation metrics ( including correlation coefficients and FSCs ) were determined using Phenix 40 - 42 and are presented in Extended Data Table 2 . Contact areas between protein subunits were calculated using the CCP4 43 program Areaimol 44 , 45 . Since contact surface calculations are very sensitive to coordinate error we enlarged the probe radius to 5 . 0 Å to reduce sensitivity and allow values to be compared with greater confidence .
