Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Alec Radford * 1 Jeffrey Wu * 1 Rewon Child 1 David Luan 1 Dario Amodei * * 1 Ilya Sutskever * * 1 Abstract Natural language processing tasks , such as ques - tion answering , machine translation , reading com - prehension , and summarization , are typically approached with supervised learning on task - speciﬁc datasets . We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any ex - plicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText . When conditioned on a document plus questions , the an - swers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127 , 000 + training examples . The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero - shot task transfer and in - creasing it improves performance in a log - linear fashion across tasks . Our largest model , GPT - 2 , is a 1 . 5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested lan - guage modeling datasets in a zero - shot setting but still underﬁts WebText . Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain co - herent paragraphs of text . These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language pro - cessing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations . 1 . Introduction Machine learning systems now excel ( in expectation ) at tasks they are trained for by using a combination of large datasets , high - capacity models , and supervised learning ( Krizhevsky et al . , 2012 ) ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ) ( Amodei et al . , 2016 ) . Yet these systems are brittle and sensitive to slight changes in the data distribution ( Recht et al . , 2018 ) and task speciﬁcation ( Kirkpatrick et al . , 2017 ) . Current sys - tems are better characterized as narrow experts rather than * , * * Equal contribution 1 OpenAI , San Francisco , Califor - nia , United States . Correspondence to : Alec Radford < alec @ openai . com > . competent generalists . We would like to move towards more general systems which can perform many tasks – eventually without the need to manually create and label a training dataset for each one . The dominant approach to creating ML systems is to col - lect a dataset of training examples demonstrating correct behavior for a desired task , train a system to imitate these behaviors , and then test its performance on independent and identically distributed ( IID ) held - out examples . This has served well to make progress on narrow experts . But the often erratic behavior of captioning models ( Lake et al . , 2017 ) , reading comprehension systems ( Jia & Liang , 2017 ) , and image classiﬁers ( Alcorn et al . , 2018 ) on the diversity and variety of possible inputs highlights some of the short - comings of this approach . Our suspicion is that the prevalence of single task training on single domain datasets is a major contributor to the lack of generalization observed in current systems . Progress towards robust systems with current architectures is likely to require training and measuring performance on a wide range of domains and tasks . Recently , several benchmarks have been proposed such as GLUE ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) and decaNLP ( McCann et al . , 2018 ) to begin studying this . Multitask learning ( Caruana , 1997 ) is a promising frame - work for improving general performance . However , mul - titask training in NLP is still nascent . Recent work re - ports modest performance improvements ( Yogatama et al . , 2019 ) and the two most ambitious efforts to date have trained on a total of 10 and 17 ( dataset , objective ) pairs respectively ( McCann et al . , 2018 ) ( Bowman et al . , 2018 ) . From a meta - learning perspective , each ( dataset , objective ) pair is a single training example sampled from the distribution of datasets and objectives . Current ML systems need hundreds to thousands of examples to induce functions which generalize well . This suggests that multitask training many need just as many effective training pairs to realize its promise with current approaches . It will be very difﬁcult to continue to scale the creation of datasets and the design of objectives to the degree that may be re - quired to brute force our way there with current techniques . This motivates exploring additional setups for performing multitask learning . The current best performing systems on language tasks Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Figure 1 . Zero - shot task performance of WebText LMs as a function of model size on many NLP tasks . Reading Comprehension results are on CoQA ( Reddy et al . , 2018 ) , translation on WMT - 14 Fr - En ( Artetxe et al . , 2017 ) , summarization on CNN and Daily Mail ( See et al . , 2017 ) , and Question Answering on Natural Questions ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2019 ) . Section 3 contains detailed descriptions of each result . utilize a combination of pre - training and supervised ﬁne - tuning . This approach has a long history with a trend to - wards more ﬂexible forms of transfer . First , word vectors were learned and used as inputs to task - speciﬁc architec - tures ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) ( Collobert et al . , 2011 ) , then the contextual representations of recurrent networks were transferred ( Dai & Le , 2015 ) ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) , and re - cent work suggests that task - speciﬁc architectures are no longer necessary and transferring many self - attention blocks is sufﬁcient ( Radford et al . , 2018 ) ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) . These methods still require supervised training in order to perform a task . When only minimal or no supervised data is available , another line of work has demonstrated the promise of language models to perform speciﬁc tasks , such as commonsense reasoning ( Schwartz et al . , 2017 ) and sentiment analysis ( Radford et al . , 2017 ) . In this paper , we connect these two lines of work and con - tinue the trend of more general methods of transfer . We demonstrate language models can perform down - stream tasks in a zero - shot setting – without any parameter or archi - tecture modiﬁcation . We demonstrate this approach shows potential by highlighting the ability of language models to perform a wide range of tasks in a zero - shot setting . We achieve promising , competitive , and state of the art results depending on the task . 2 . Approach At the core of our approach is language modeling . Lan - guage modeling is usually framed as unsupervised distri - bution estimation from a set of examples ( x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) each composed of variable length sequences of symbols ( s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n ) . Since language has a natural sequential or - dering , it is common to factorize the joint probabilities over symbols as the product of conditional probabilities ( Jelinek & Mercer , 1980 ) ( Bengio et al . , 2003 ) : p ( x ) = n (cid:89) i = 1 p ( s n | s 1 , . . . , s n − 1 ) ( 1 ) This approach allows for tractable sampling from and es - timation of p ( x ) as well as any conditionals of the form p ( s n − k , . . . , s n | s 1 , . . . , s n − k − 1 ) . In recent years , there have been signiﬁcant improvements in the expressiveness of mod - els that can compute these conditional probabilities , such as self - attention architectures like the Transformer ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) . Learning to perform a single task can be expressed in a probabilistic framework as estimating a conditional distri - bution p ( output | input ) . Since a general system should be able to perform many different tasks , even for the same input , it should condition not only on the input but also on the task to be performed . That is , it should model p ( output | input , task ) . This has been variously formalized in multitask and meta - learning settings . Task conditioning is often implemented at an architectural level , such as the task speciﬁc encoders and decoders in ( Kaiser et al . , 2017 ) or at an algorithmic level such as the inner and outer loop optimization framework of MAML ( Finn et al . , 2017 ) . But as exempliﬁed in McCann et al . ( 2018 ) , language provides a ﬂexible way to specify tasks , inputs , and outputs all as a sequence of symbols . For example , a translation training example can be written as the sequence ( translate to french , english text , french text ) . Like - wise , a reading comprehension training example can be written as ( answer the question , document , question , answer ) . McCann et al . ( 2018 ) demon - strated it was possible to train a single model , the MQAN , Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners to infer and perform many different tasks on examples with this type of format . Language modeling is also able to , in principle , learn the tasks of McCann et al . ( 2018 ) without the need for explicit supervision of which symbols are the outputs to be pre - dicted . Since the supervised objective is the the same as the unsupervised objective but only evaluated on a subset of the sequence , the global minimum of the unsupervised objective is also the global minimum of the supervised objective . In this slightly toy setting , the concerns with density estimation as a principled training objective discussed in ( Sutskever et al . , 2015 ) are side stepped . The problem instead becomes whether we are able to , in practice , optimize the unsuper - vised objective to convergence . Preliminary experiments conﬁrmed that sufﬁciently large language models are able to perform multitask learning in this toy - ish setup but learning is much slower than in explicitly supervised approaches . While it is a large step from the well - posed setup described above to the messiness of “language in the wild” , Weston ( 2016 ) argues , in the context of dialog , for the need to develop systems capable of learning from natural language directly and demonstrated a proof of concept – learning a QA task without a reward signal by using forward prediction of a teacher’s outputs . While dialog is an attractive approach , we worry it is overly restrictive . The internet contains a vast amount of information that is passively available without the need for interactive communication . Our speculation is that a language model with sufﬁcient capacity will begin to learn to infer and perform the tasks demonstrated in natural language sequences in order to better predict them , regardless of their method of procurement . If a language model is able to do this it will be , in effect , performing unsupervised multitask learning . We test whether this is the case by analyzing the performance of language models in a zero - shot setting on a wide variety of tasks . 2 . 1 . Training Dataset Most prior work trained language models on a single do - main of text , such as news articles ( Jozefowicz et al . , 2016 ) , Wikipedia ( Merity et al . , 2016 ) , or ﬁction books ( Kiros et al . , 2015 ) . Our approach motivates building as large and diverse a dataset as possible in order to collect natural lan - guage demonstrations of tasks in as varied of domains and contexts as possible . A promising source of diverse and nearly unlimited text is web scrapes such as Common Crawl . While these archives are many orders of magnitude larger than current language modeling datasets , they have signiﬁcant data quality issues . Trinh & Le ( 2018 ) used Common Crawl in their work on commonsense reasoning but noted a large amount of doc - uments “whose content are mostly unintelligible” . We ob - served similar data issues in our initial experiments with ”I’m not the cleverest man in the world , but like they say in French : Je ne suis pas un imbecile [ I’m not a fool ] . In a now - deleted post from Aug . 16 , Soheil Eid , Tory candidate in the riding of Joliette , wrote in French : ” Mentez mentez , il en restera toujours quelque chose , ” which translates as , ” Lie lie and something will always remain . ” “I hate the word ‘ perfume , ”’ Burr says . ‘It’s somewhat better in French : ‘ parfum . ’ If listened carefully at 29 : 55 , a conversation can be heard between two guys in French : “ - Comment on fait pour aller de l’autre cot´e ? - Quel autre cot´e ? ” , which means “ - How do you get to the other side ? - What side ? ” . If this sounds like a bit of a stretch , consider this ques - tion in French : As - tu aller au cin´ema ? , or Did you go to the movies ? , which literally translates as Have - you to go to movies / theater ? “ Brevet Sans Garantie Du Gouvernement ” , translated to English : “ Patented without government warranty ” . Table 1 . Examples of naturally occurring demonstrations of En - glish to French and French to English translation found throughout the WebText training set . Common Crawl . Trinh & Le ( 2018 ) ’s best results were achieved using a small subsample of Common Crawl which included only documents most similar to their target dataset , the Winograd Schema Challenge . While this is a pragmatic approach to improve performance on a speciﬁc task , we want to avoid making assumptions about the tasks to be performed ahead of time . Instead , we created a new web scrape which emphasizes document quality . To do this we only scraped web pages which have been curated / ﬁltered by humans . Manually ﬁltering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive so as a starting point , we scraped all outbound links from Reddit , a social media platform , which received at least 3 karma . This can be thought of as a heuristic indicator for whether other users found the link interesting , educational , or just funny . The resulting dataset , WebText , contains the text subset of these 45 million links . To extract the text from HTML responses we use a combination of the Dragnet ( Peters & Lecocq , 2013 ) and Newspaper 1 content extractors . All re - sults presented in this paper use a preliminary version of WebText which does not include links created after Dec 2017 and which after de - duplication and some heuristic based cleaning contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 GB of text . We removed all Wikipedia documents from WebText since it is a common data source for other datasets and could complicate analysis due to over - 1 https : / / github . com / codelucas / newspaper Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners lapping training data with test evaluation tasks . 2 . 2 . Input Representation A general language model ( LM ) should be able to compute the probability of ( and also generate ) any string . Current large scale LMs include pre - processing steps such as lower - casing , tokenization , and out - of - vocabulary tokens which restrict the space of model - able strings . While processing Unicode strings as a sequence of UTF - 8 bytes elegantly ful - ﬁlls this requirement as exempliﬁed in work such as Gillick et al . ( 2015 ) , current byte - level LMs are not competitive with word - level LMs on large scale datasets such as the One Billion Word Benchmark ( Al - Rfou et al . , 2018 ) . We observed a similar performance gap in our own attempts to train standard byte - level LMs on WebText . Byte Pair Encoding ( BPE ) ( Sennrich et al . , 2015 ) is a practical middle ground between character and word level language modeling which effectively interpolates between word level inputs for frequent symbol sequences and char - acter level inputs for infrequent symbol sequences . Despite its name , reference BPE implementations often operate on Unicode code points and not byte sequences . These imple - mentations would require including the full space of Uni - code symbols in order to model all Unicode strings . This would result in a base vocabulary of over 130 , 000 before any multi - symbol tokens are added . This is prohibitively large compared to the 32 , 000 to 64 , 000 token vocabularies often used with BPE . In contrast , a byte - level version of BPE only requires a base vocabulary of size 256 . However , directly applying BPE to the byte sequence results in sub - optimal merges due to BPE using a greedy frequency based heuristic for building the token vocabulary . We observed BPE including many versions of common words like dog since they occur in many variations such as dog . dog ! dog ? . This results in a sub - optimal allocation of limited vocabulary slots and model capacity . To avoid this , we pre - vent BPE from merging across character categories for any byte sequence . We add an exception for spaces which sig - niﬁcantly improves the compression efﬁciency while adding only minimal fragmentation of words across multiple vocab tokens . This input representation allows us to combine the empirical beneﬁts of word - level LMs with the generality of byte - level approaches . Since our approach can assign a probability to any Unicode string , this allows us to evaluate our LMs on any dataset regardless of pre - processing , tokenization , or vocab size . 2 . 3 . Model We use a Transformer ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) based archi - tecture for our LMs . The model largely follows the details of the OpenAI GPT model ( Radford et al . , 2018 ) with a Parameters Layers d model 117M 12 768 345M 24 1024 762M 36 1280 1542M 48 1600 Table 2 . Architecture hyperparameters for the 4 model sizes . few modiﬁcations . Layer normalization ( Ba et al . , 2016 ) was moved to the input of each sub - block , similar to a pre - activation residual network ( He et al . , 2016 ) and an additional layer normalization was added after the ﬁnal self - attention block . A modiﬁed initialization which accounts for the accumulation on the residual path with model depth is used . We scale the weights of residual layers at initial - ization by a factor of 1 / √ N where N is the number of residual layers . The vocabulary is expanded to 50 , 257 . We also increase the context size from 512 to 1024 tokens and a larger batchsize of 512 is used . 3 . Experiments We trained and benchmarked four LMs with approximately log - uniformly spaced sizes . The architectures are summa - rized in Table 2 . The smallest model is equivalent to the original GPT , and the second smallest equivalent to the largest model from BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) . Our largest model , which we call GPT - 2 , has over an order of magni - tude more parameters than GPT . The learning rate of each model was manually tuned for the best perplexity on a 5 % held - out sample of WebText . All models still underﬁt Web - Text and held - out perplexity has as of yet improved given more training time . 3 . 1 . Language Modeling As an initial step towards zero - shot task transfer , we are interested in understanding how WebText LM’s perform at zero - shot domain transfer on the primary task they are trained for – language modeling . Since our model operates on a byte level and does not require lossy pre - processing or tokenization , we can evaluate it on any language model benchmark . Results on language modeling datasets are commonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or ex - ponentiated version of the average negative log probability per canonical prediction unit - usually a character , a byte , or a word . We evaluate the same quantity by computing the log - probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and dividing by the number of canonical units . For many of these datasets , WebText LMs would be tested signiﬁcantly out - of - distribution , having to predict aggressively standardized text , tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation and contractions , shufﬂed sentences , and even the string Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners LAMBADA LAMBADA CBT - CN CBT - NE WikiText2 PTB enwik8 text8 WikiText103 1BW ( PPL ) ( ACC ) ( ACC ) ( ACC ) ( PPL ) ( PPL ) ( BPB ) ( BPC ) ( PPL ) ( PPL ) SOTA 99 . 8 59 . 23 85 . 7 82 . 3 39 . 14 46 . 54 0 . 99 1 . 08 18 . 3 21 . 8 117M 35 . 13 45 . 99 87 . 65 83 . 4 29 . 41 65 . 85 1 . 16 1 . 17 37 . 50 75 . 20 345M 15 . 60 55 . 48 92 . 35 87 . 1 22 . 76 47 . 33 1 . 01 1 . 06 26 . 37 55 . 72 762M 10 . 87 60 . 12 93 . 45 88 . 0 19 . 93 40 . 31 0 . 97 1 . 02 22 . 05 44 . 575 1542M 8 . 63 63 . 24 93 . 30 89 . 05 18 . 34 35 . 76 0 . 93 0 . 98 17 . 48 42 . 16 Table 3 .

CBT results are from ( Bajgar et al . , 2016 ) . LAMBADA accuracy result is from ( Hoang et al . , 2018 ) and LAMBADA perplexity result is from ( Grave et al . , 2016 ) . Other results are from ( Dai et al . , 2019 ) . < UNK > which is extremely rare in WebText - occurring only 26 times in 40 billion bytes . We report our main re - sults in Table 3 using invertible de - tokenizers which remove as many of these tokenization / pre - processing artifacts as possible . Since these de - tokenizers are invertible , we can still calculate the log probability of a dataset and they can be thought of as a simple form of domain adaptation . We observe gains of 2 . 5 to 5 perplexity for GPT - 2 with these de - tokenizers . WebText LMs transfer well across domains and datasets , improving the state of the art on 7 out of the 8 datasets in a zero - shot setting . Large improvements are noticed on small datasets such as Penn Treebank and WikiText - 2 which have only 1 to 2 million training tokens . Large improvements are also noticed on datasets created to measure long - term dependencies like LAMBADA ( Paperno et al . , 2016 ) and the Children’s Book Test ( Hill et al . , 2015 ) . Our model is still signiﬁcantly worse than prior work on the One Billion Word Benchmark ( Chelba et al . , 2013 ) . This is likely due to a combination of it being both the largest dataset and having some of the most destructive pre - processing - 1BW’s sentence level shufﬂing removes all long - range structure . 3 . 2 . Children’s Book Test Figure 2 . Performance on the Children’s Book Test as a function of model capacity . Human performance are from Bajgar et al . ( 2016 ) , instead of the much lower estimates from the original paper . The Children’s Book Test ( CBT ) ( Hill et al . , 2015 ) was created to examine the performance of LMs on different cat - egories of words : named entities , nouns , verbs , and preposi - tions . Rather than reporting perplexity as an evaluation met - ric , CBT reports accuracy on an automatically constructed cloze test where the task is to predict which of 10 possible choices for an omitted word is correct . Following the LM approach introduced in the original paper , we compute the probability of each choice and the rest of the sentence con - ditioned on this choice according to the LM , and predict the one with the highest probability . As seen in Figure 2 performance steadily improves as model size is increased and closes the majority of the gap to human performance on this test . Data overlap analysis showed one of the CBT test set books , The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling , is in WebText , so we report results on the validation set which has no signiﬁcant overlap . GPT - 2 achieves new state of the art results of 93 . 3 % on common nouns and 89 . 1 % on named entities . A de - tokenizer was applied to remove PTB style tokenization artifacts from CBT . 3 . 3 . LAMBADA The LAMBADA dataset ( Paperno et al . , 2016 ) tests the ability of systems to model long - range dependencies in text . The task is to predict the ﬁnal word of sentences which require at least 50 tokens of context for a human to successfully predict . GPT - 2 improves the state of the art from 99 . 8 ( Grave et al . , 2016 ) to 8 . 6 perplexity and increases the accuracy of LMs on this test from 19 % ( Dehghani et al . , 2018 ) to 52 . 66 % . Investigating GPT - 2’s errors showed most predictions are valid continuations of the sentence , but are not valid ﬁnal words . This suggests that the LM is not using the additional useful constraint that the word must be the ﬁnal of the sentence . Adding a stop - word ﬁlter as an approximation to this further increases accuracy to 63 . 24 % , improving the overall state of the art on this task by 4 % . The previous state of the art ( Hoang et al . , 2018 ) used a different restricted prediction setting where the outputs of the model were constrained to only words that appeared in the context . For GPT - 2 , this restriction is harmful rather than helpful Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners since 19 % of answers are not in context . We use a version of the dataset without preprocessing . 3 . 4 . Winograd Schema Challenge Figure 3 . Performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge as a function of model capacity . The Winograd Schema challenge ( Levesque et al . , 2012 ) was constructed to measure the capability of a system to perform commonsense reasoning by measuring its ability to resolve ambiguities in text . Recently Trinh & Le ( 2018 ) demonstrated signiﬁcant progress on this challenge using LMs , by predicting the resolution of the ambiguity with higher probability . We follow their problem formulation and visualize the performance of our models with both full and partial scoring techniques in Figure 3 . GPT - 2 improves state of the art accuracy by 7 % , achieving 70 . 70 % . The dataset is quite small with only 273 examples so we recommend reading Trichelair et al . ( 2018 ) to help contextualize this result . 3 . 5 . Reading Comprehension The Conversation Question Answering dataset ( CoQA ) Reddy et al . ( 2018 ) consists of documents from 7 different domains paired with natural language dialogues between a question asker and a question answerer about the document . CoQA tests reading comprehension capabilities and also the ability of models to answer questions that depend on conversation history ( such as “Why ? ” ) . Greedy decoding from GPT - 2 when conditioned on a doc - ument , the history of the associated conversation , and a ﬁnal token A : achieves 55 F1 on the development set . This matches or exceeds the performance of 3 out of 4 base - line systems without using the 127 , 000 + manually collected question answer pairs those baselines were trained on . The supervised SOTA , a BERT based system ( Devlin et al . , R - 1 R - 2 R - L R - AVG Bottom - Up Sum 41 . 22 18 . 68 38 . 34 32 . 75 Lede - 3 40 . 38 17 . 66 36 . 62 31 . 55 Seq2Seq + Attn 31 . 33 11 . 81 28 . 83 23 . 99 GPT - 2 TL ; DR : 29 . 34 8 . 27 26 . 58 21 . 40 Random - 3 28 . 78 8 . 63 25 . 52 20 . 98 GPT - 2 no hint 21 . 58 4 . 03 19 . 47 15 . 03 Table 4 . Summarization performance as measured by ROUGE F1 metrics on the CNN and Daily Mail dataset . Bottom - Up Sum is the SOTA model from ( Gehrmann et al . , 2018 ) 2018 ) , is nearing the 89 F1 performance of humans . While GPT - 2’s performance is exciting for a system without any su - pervised training , some inspection of its answers and errors suggests GPT - 2 often uses simple retrieval based heuristics such as answer with a name from the document in response to a who question . 3 . 6 . Summarization We test GPT - 2’s ability to perform summarization on the CNN and Daily Mail dataset ( Nallapati et al . , 2016 ) . To in - duce summarization behavior we add the text TL ; DR : after the article and generate 100 tokens with Top - k random sam - pling ( Fan et al . , 2018 ) with k = 2 which reduces repetition and encourages more abstractive summaries than greedy de - coding . We use the ﬁrst 3 generated sentences in these 100 tokens as the summary . While qualitatively the generations resemble summaries , as shown in Table 14 , they often focus on recent content from the article or confuse speciﬁc details such as how many cars were involved in a crash or whether a logo was on a hat or shirt . On the commonly reported ROUGE 1 , 2 , L metrics the generated summaries only begin to approach the performance of classic neural baselines and just barely outperforms selecting 3 random sentences from the article . GPT - 2’s performance drops by 6 . 4 points on the aggregate metric when the task hint is removed which demonstrates the ability to invoke task speciﬁc behavior in a language model with natural language . 3 . 7 . Translation We test whether GPT - 2 has begun to learn how to translate from one language to another . In order to help it infer that this is the desired task , we condition the language model on a context of example pairs of the format english sentence = french sentence and then after a ﬁ - nal prompt of english sentence = we sample from the model with greedy decoding and use the ﬁrst generated sentence as the translation . On the WMT - 14 English - French test set , GPT - 2 gets 5 BLEU , which is slightly worse than a word - by - word substitution with a bilingual lexicon in - ferred in previous work on unsupervised word translation Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Question Generated Answer Correct Probability Who wrote the book the origin of species ?

The 30 most conﬁdent answers generated by GPT - 2 on the development set of Natural Questions sorted by their probability according to GPT - 2 . None of these questions appear in WebText according to the procedure described in Section 4 . ( Conneau et al . , 2017b ) . On the WMT - 14 French - English test set , GPT - 2 is able to leverage its very strong English language model to perform signiﬁcantly better , achieving 11 . 5 BLEU . This outperforms several unsupervised machine translation baselines from ( Artetxe et al . , 2017 ) and ( Lample et al . , 2017 ) but is still much worse than the 33 . 5 BLEU of the current best unsupervised machine translation approach ( Artetxe et al . , 2019 ) . Performance on this task was sur - prising to us , since we deliberately removed non - English webpages from WebText as a ﬁltering step . In order to con - ﬁrm this , we ran a byte - level language detector 2 on WebText which detected only 10MB of data in the French language which is approximately 500x smaller than the monolingual French corpus common in prior unsupervised machine trans - lation research . 3 . 8 . Question Answering A potential way to test what information is contained within a language model is to evaluate how often it generates the correct answer to factoid - style questions . Previous showcas - ing of this behavior in neural systems where all information is stored in parameters such as A Neural Conversational Model ( Vinyals & Le , 2015 ) reported qualitative results due to the lack of high - quality evaluation datasets . The recently introduced Natural Questions dataset ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2 https : / / github . com / CLD2Owners / cld2 2019 ) is a promising resource to test this more quantita - tively . Similar to translation , the context of the language model is seeded with example question answer pairs which helps the model infer the short answer style of the dataset . GPT - 2 answers 4 . 1 % of questions correctly when evalu - ated by the exact match metric commonly used on reading comprehension datasets like SQUAD . 3 As a comparison point , the smallest model does not exceed the 1 . 0 % accu - racy of an incredibly simple baseline which returns the most common answer for each question type ( who , what , where , etc . . . ) . GPT - 2 answers 5 . 3 times more questions correctly , suggesting that model capacity has been a major factor in the poor performance of neural systems on this kind of task as of yet . The probability GPT - 2 assigns to its generated answers is well calibrated and GPT - 2 has an accuracy of 63 . 1 % on the 1 % of questions it is most conﬁdent in . The 30 most conﬁdent answers generated by GPT - 2 on develop - ment set questions are shown in Table 5 . The performance of GPT - 2 is still much , much , worse than the 30 to 50 % range of open domain question answering systems which hybridize information retrieval with extractive document question answering ( Alberti et al . , 2019 ) . 3 Alec , who previously thought of himself as good at random trivia , answered 17 of 100 randomly sampled examples correctly when tested in the same setting as GPT - 2 .

Percentage of test set 8 grams overlapping with training sets . 4 . Generalization vs Memorization Recent work in computer vision has shown that common im - age datasets contain a non - trivial amount of near - duplicate images . For instance CIFAR - 10 has 3 . 3 % overlap between train and test images ( Barz & Denzler , 2019 ) . This results in an over - reporting of the generalization performance of ma - chine learning systems . As the size of datasets increases this issue becomes increasingly likely which suggests a similar phenomena could be happening with WebText . Therefore it is important to analyze how much test data also shows up in the training data . To study this we created Bloom ﬁlters containing 8 - grams of WebText training set tokens . To improve recall , strings were normalized to contain only lower - cased alphanumeric words with a single space as a delimiter . The Bloom ﬁlters were constructed such that the false positive rate is upper bounded by 110 8 . We further veriﬁed the low false positive rate by generating 1M strings , of which zero were found by the ﬁlter . These Bloom ﬁlters let us calculate , given a dataset , the percentage of 8 - grams from that dataset that are also found in the WebText training set . Table 6 shows this overlap anal - ysis for the test sets of common LM benchmarks . Common LM datasets’ test sets have between 1 - 6 % overlap with Web - Text train , with an average of overlap of 3 . 2 % . Somewhat surprisingly , many datasets have larger overlaps with their own training splits , with an average of 5 . 9 % overlap . Our approach optimizes for recall , and while manual inspec - tion of the overlaps shows many common phrases , there are many longer matches that are due to duplicated data . This is not unique to WebText . For instance , we discovered that the test set of WikiText - 103 has an article which is also in the training dataset . Since there are only 60 articles in the test set there is at least an overlap of 1 . 6 % . 4 Potentially more worryingly , 1BW has an overlap of nearly 13 . 2 % with its own training set according to our procedure . For the Winograd Schema Challenge , we found only 10 schemata which had any 8 - gram overlaps with the WebText training set . Of these , 2 were spurious matches . Of the remaining 8 , only 1 schema appeared in any contexts that 4 A signiﬁcant portion of additional overlap is due to editors reusing some paragraphs across multiple articles with a shared theme such as various battles in the Korean War . gave away the answer . For CoQA , about 15 % of documents in the news domain are already in WebText and the model performs about 3 F1 better on these . CoQA’s development set metric reports the average performance over 5 different domains and we measure a gain of about 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 F1 due to overlap across the various domains . However , no actual training questions or answers are in WebText since CoQA was released after the cutoff date for links in WebText . On LAMBADA , the average overlap is 1 . 2 % . GPT - 2 per - forms about 2 perplexity better on examples with greater than 15 % overlap . Recalculating metrics when excluding all examples with any overlap shifts results from 8 . 6 to 8 . 7 perplexity and reduces accuracy from 63 . 2 % to 62 . 9 % . This very small change in overall results is likely due to only 1 in 200 examples having signiﬁcant overlap . Overall , our analysis suggests that data overlap between WebText training data and speciﬁc evaluation datasets pro - vides a small but consistent beneﬁt to reported results . How - ever , for most datasets we do not notice signiﬁcantly larger overlaps than those already existing between standard train - ing and test sets , as Table 6 highlights . Understanding and quantifying how highly similar text im - pacts performance is an important research question . Better de - duplication techniques such as scalable fuzzy matching could also help better answer these questions . For now , we recommend the use of n - gram overlap based de - duplication as an important veriﬁcation step and sanity check during the creation of training and test splits for new NLP datasets . Another potential way of determining whether the perfor - mance of WebText LMs is attributable to memorization is inspecting their performance on their own held - out set . As shown in Figure 4 , performance on both the training and test sets of WebText are similar and improve together as model size is increased . This suggests even GPT - 2 is still underﬁtting on WebText in many ways . GPT - 2 is also able to write news articles about the discovery of talking unicorns . An example is provided in Table 13 . 5 . Related Work A signiﬁcant portion of this work measured the performance of larger language models trained on larger datasets . This Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Figure 4 . The performance of LMs trained on WebText as a func - tion of model size . is similar to the work of Jozefowicz et al . ( 2016 ) which scaled RNN based language models on the 1 Billion Word Benchmark . Bajgar et al . ( 2016 ) also previously improved results on the Children’s Book Test by creating a much larger training dataset out of Project Gutenberg to supplement the standard training dataset . Hestness et al . ( 2017 ) conducted a thorough analysis of how the performance of various deep learning models changes as a function of both model capac - ity and dataset size . Our experiments , while much noisier across tasks , suggest similar trends hold for sub - tasks of an objective and continue into the 1B + parameter regime . Interesting learned functionality in generative models has been documented before such as the cells in an RNN language model performing line - width tracking and quote / comment detection Karpathy et al . ( 2015 ) . More in - spirational to our work was the observation of Liu et al . ( 2018 ) that a model trained to generate Wikipedia articles also learned to translate names between languages . Previous work has explored alternative approaches to ﬁlter - ing and constructing a large text corpus of web pages , such as the iWeb Corpus ( Davies , 2018 ) . There has been extensive work on pre - training methods for language tasks . In addition to those mentioned in the introduction , GloVe ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) scaled word vector representation learning to all of Common Crawl . An inﬂuential early work on deep representation learning for text was Skip - thought Vectors ( Kiros et al . , 2015 ) . McCann et al . ( 2017 ) explored the use of representations derived from machine translation models and Howard & Ruder ( 2018 ) improved the RNN based ﬁne - tuning approaches of ( Dai & Le , 2015 ) . ( Conneau et al . , 2017a ) studied the transfer performance of representations learned by natural language inference models and ( Subramanian et al . , 2018 ) explored large - scale multitask training . ( Ramachandran et al . , 2016 ) demonstrated that seq2seq mod - els beneﬁt from being initialized with pre - trained language models as encoders and decoders . More recent work has shown that LM pre - training is helpful when ﬁne - tuned for difﬁcult generation tasks like chit - chat dialog and dialog based question answering systems as well ( Wolf et al . , 2019 ) ( Dinan et al . , 2018 ) . 6 . Discussion Much research has been dedicated to learning ( Hill et al . , 2016 ) , understanding ( Levy & Goldberg , 2014 ) , and criti - cally evaluating ( Wieting & Kiela , 2019 ) the representations of both supervised and unsupervised pre - training methods . Our results suggest that unsupervised task learning is an additional promising area of research to explore . These ﬁndings potentially help explain the widespread success of pre - training techniques for down - stream NLP tasks as we show that , in the limit , one of these pre - training techniques begins to learn to perform tasks directly without the need for supervised adaption or modiﬁcation . On reading comprehension the performance of GPT - 2 is competitive with supervised baselines in a zero - shot setting . However , on other tasks such as summarization , while it is qualitatively performing the task , its performance is still only rudimentary according to quantitative metrics . While suggestive as a research result , in terms of practical applica - tions , the zero - shot performance of GPT - 2 is still far from use - able . We have studied the zero - shot performance of WebText LMs on many canonical NLP tasks , but there are many addi - tional tasks that could be evaluated . There are undoubtedly many practical tasks where the performance of GPT - 2 is still no better than random . Even on common tasks that we evaluated on , such as question answering and translation , language models only begin to outperform trivial baselines when they have sufﬁcient capacity . While zero - shot performance establishes a baseline of the potential performance of GPT - 2 on many tasks , it is not clear where the ceiling is with ﬁnetuning . On some tasks , GPT - 2’s fully abstractive output is a signiﬁcant departure from the extractive pointer network ( Vinyals et al . , 2015 ) based outputs which are currently state of the art on many question answering and reading comprehension datasets . Given the prior success of ﬁne - tuning GPT , we plan to in - vestigate ﬁne - tuning on benchmarks such as decaNLP and GLUE , especially since it is unclear whether the additional Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners training data and capacity of GPT - 2 is sufﬁcient to over - come the inefﬁciencies of uni - directional representations demonstrated by BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) . 7 . Conclusion When a large language model is trained on a sufﬁciently large and diverse dataset it is able to perform well across many domains and datasets . GPT - 2 zero - shots to state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 tested language model - ing datasets . The diversity of tasks the model is able to perform in a zero - shot setting suggests that high - capacity models trained to maximize the likelihood of a sufﬁciently varied text corpus begin to learn how to perform a surprising amount of tasks without the need for explicit supervision . 5 Acknowledgements Thanks to everyone who wrote the text , shared the links , and upvoted the content in WebText .

Model capacity To complement the reported perplexity gains of bigger LMs on WebText show in Figure 4 , Tables 7 through 11 show side - by - side completions of the smallest WebText LM and GPT - 2 on random unseen WebText test set articles . 8 . 2 . Text Memorization We observe some memorizing behavior in GPT - 2 on longer strings that are repeated many times in the dataset such as famous quotes or speeches . For example , when conditioned on the ﬁrst sentence and a half of the Gettysburg Address ( which occurs approximately 40 times throughout WebText ) , an argmax decode from GPT - 2 recovers the speech . Even when sampling without truncation , we ﬁnd that the model copies the speech for awhile before drifting , albeit in a similar style . It typically drifts within 100 - 200 tokens , and displays widening diversity once it drifts . To quantify how often exact memorization shows up in samples , we generated samples from GPT - 2 conditioned on WebText test set articles and compared the overlap rates of GPT - 2’s generations to the overlap rates of the ground - truth completions . The results of this analysis are shown below and suggest that GPT - 2 repeats text from the training set less often then the baseline rate of held - out articles . Figure 5 . CDF of percentage 8 - gram overlap with WebText train - ing set , for both WebText test set and samples ( conditioned on WebText test set , with top - k truncated random sampling with k = 40 ) . Most samples have less than 1 % overlap , including over 30 % of samples with no overlap , whereas the median for test set is 2 . 6 % overlap . 8 . 3 .

Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Context ( WebText test ) Outﬁt 1 : Typical This pairing was the ﬁrst outﬁt I thought of when I bought the shoes . It’s like a summer version of this Jake Grantham outﬁt ; in fact , my shoes are close to the colors of his Nike Racers ! Instead of a heavy Harris Tweed jacket and denim shirt , I’m wearing a cotton DB jacket and and a linen shirt . Both fabrics ( in these colors ) are an absolute must for summer , as they go with both dark and and light pants ! As you can see , they pair wonderfully with the dark jeans and shoes . It’s a pseudo menswear / prep outﬁt . Overall , this is a very casual outﬁt which is why I paired my sneakers with it . I’m not about wearing a full wool suit with sneakers ( as GQ shows a lot ) but I’m deﬁnitely open to keeping things casual , like this cotton DB . Casual fabrics are key to pulling off your sneakers in a dressed down menswear outﬁt . I’d even suggest to wear these sneakers with a khaki chino suit or a white linen suit . Just be sure to ditch the tie or wear a tee or polo ; wearing a tie with sneakers is a bit too much Small model completion . Outﬁt 2 : High End This outﬁt was just in the eye of the storm . It’s a hybrid of what ASICS does with streetwear ( like J . Crew ) and what J . Crew does with casual pieces that are a bit more traditional . Again , as I mentioned before , it’s a low budget item and they can be very expensive . These will deﬁnitely be an issue if you’re trying to work as a casual sneakermaker , and that’s OK but don’t hesitate if you want to try the lower price versions of their outﬁts ! This version features a very low cut - cut neckline ( which is not a bad thing ) , slightly longer legs , and a pair of long legs to keep things nice . My preferred color of color these items are blue - gray ( which is my ﬁrst colors , as they are a light white ) , or black ( which is my favorite of my designs ) . As always , my pick of colors from this store have nothing to do with that other than the de - sign . For a high end , I would recommend this to everyone ! Outﬁt 3 : High Light This was a ”high light” look while I had a chance to get some color . I think the color is based on GPT - 2 completion for me ! Outﬁt 2 : Casual Jacket I know that some people might be opposed to wearing sneakers in a turtleneck , but I wanted to be true to myself , so I went with a slim ﬁtting turtleneck in a color more similar to my favorite color of the day . Overall , it’s a classic turtleneck , with nothing too ﬂashy . I did swap my shoes for these ASICS Tiger Killshots and I wish I hadn’t did that . The shoe itself is very comfortable , however , I found that wearing them in these sneakers made my feet look a bit larger . I’d wear them with denim , chinos , whatever , but would never recommend wearing them alone . There are just too many variables involved . Outﬁt 3 : Dress This is the ﬁnal outﬁt I wore the ASICS Tiger Killshots . This version of the ASICS is a much more modern and streamlined version . The shoe has the most modern and minimal design that I can think of ! With a lot of black , these sneakers look very cool . They’ll deﬁnitely be very comfortable for summer . To me , wearing them with a suit is the easiest way to have a good pair of sneaker shoes . That’s pretty much it ! If Table 7 .

Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Context ( WebText test ) Some of the most glorious historical attractions in Spain date from the period of Muslim rule , including The Mezquita , built as the Great Mosque of C´ordoba and the Medina Azahara , also in C´ordoba and now in ruins but still visitable as such and built as the Madinat al - Zahra , the Palace of al - Andalus ; and the Alhambra in Granada , a splendid , intact palace . There are also two synagogues still standing that were built during the era of Muslim Spain : Santa Mar´ıa la Blanca in Toledo and the Synagogue of C´ordoba , in the Old City . Reconquista and Imperial era [ edit ] Small model completion The era of Muslim Spain is very different from that of other parts of the world , with a rather extensive medieval history . While the Spanish Empire existed during the second half of the 9th century BC it was quite slowly transformed to a small , secularized empire by 1150 A . D . , in a much more prosperous and diverse state . In 1050 CE the emperor of Naples , at least partially in characterised by a series of wars and invasions from the north - western coast to the western coast of the region ( e . g . , on the Danube River which extended all the way from Gibraltar into the south of Spain , but was quickly destroyed on the same day by the Roman army ) , assumed the title of Emperor of Naples . He made a large contribution over the last few decades to restore and maintain the empire , the ﬁrst of which to the west . His successors were Ferdinand , who took power from the Papal Throne in 1148 , while the ﬁrst imperial successor was King Alfred II of Sweden . The empire was again made one of the few independent states in the European Continent and although no more than 200 million people lived on its territory during this period the people had much to say to the Emperor . From 1720 on the Muslims made up half the population of Spain . GPT - 2 completion The Reconquista ( literally , ”The return to the country” ) of 1092 and 1095 saw the establishment in the Iberian peninsula of a united kingdom of Castile and Aragon in which a Muslim dynasty would exist . This was the last time in Europe where Muslim rule would be considered ”native” and the last occasion where Christian - inﬂamed and organized conﬂicts would make themselves known in Europe . The reign of Muslim Moors in Spain is often re - ferred to , especially among non - Muslims , as the ”Conquest of Granada” and Spain is sometimes referred to as Spain in ”Granada” . The last years of Muslim rule were followed by the Spanish Reconquista where the Muslims were driven or compelled out of the Iberian Peninsula with the victory of Ferdinand IX . in the Battle of Poitiers in March 1189 and the conquest of Jerusalem in 1187 by Saladin . The Reconquista period in Spain came to an end when the Moors retreated north . However the Moorish rule would not be fully replaced by the Christian rule until the Reconquista era resumed when the Reconquista lasted from 1229 to 1492 . The last Muslim state in Spain , Granada , was con - quered by the Table 8 .

Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Context ( WebText test ) Pinky The pink ghost’s AI is designed to ”feel” opposite of the red ghost’s behavior . Pinky actually attempts to get out in front of Pac - Man . This is accomplished by setting the target 4 tiles ahead of Pac - Man’s current location in the direction that Pac - Man is travelling . One exception to this is when Pac - Man is traveling up . Due to an overﬂow bug in the code , the calculation includes a left offset equal to the expected up offset . The use of Pac - Man’s expected position allows the player to exploit the navigation code for Pinky . This was most often seen in situations where Pac - Man and Pinky are in close proximity to each other . For example , if they were headed toward one another , once they are less than 4 tiles apart , the target tile is now behind Pinky . If he encounters an intersection while in this conﬁguration , he will attempt to double - back ( by turning ) in order to reach the target tile . Player’s would often perform what was referred to as a ”head fake” by changing directions rapidly just as Pinky was approaching an intersection . By displacing the target tile just as Pinky Small model completion was coming to the left , they would get the ”correct” direction . If the location is actually farther from what Pac - Man was at , the player’s will not respond to the ghost’s movement , and the ghost will instead return to the player’s current location . This is because Pac - Man does not move by turning . The ghost will have to go to another location of some kind to return where he began , and this is achieved in many ways . It will often simply leave the location , as for example if Pac - Man did jump off a cliff , he would return to the spot where he was before vanishing into space . There is a good number of possibilities these ghost paths may be possible , but the most obvious ones are if the player wants to avoid getting caught up in the game , with a goal as easy as keeping Pac - Man in the game for 1 / 3 as long as he was . Chasing In Pac - Man’s case , this would be similar to how Pac - Man can ”catch up” in a ﬁght . A ghost could chase through enemies . This is use - ful for many reasons , both for Pac - Man and his AI . Unlike most Ghost games , this ghost simply travels in the direction from GPT - 2 completion was about to cross the intersection , Pac - Man would be able to dodge the ghosts’ projectiles and return to the safe location of the safe house . Buster The yellow ghost’s AI is speciﬁcally designed to try to avoid Pac - Man from leaving the safe house . The player must press the SPACE bar to reveal the safe house’s doors , then go into them to ﬁnd the yellow ghost hiding in the next room . The player must also note that the ghost will not attempt to exit the safe house if it sees Pac - Man already there . In fact , the ghost will not attempt an exit in the ﬁrst place unless they’re already in the safe house . These two behaviors are based on the fact that the player does not always attempt to reach the safe house before Pac - Man ( or Blinky ) . The player must also beware of this glitch if a ghost ( or another player ) is already in the safe house and attempting to get out as soon as Pac - Man or Blinky is gone . At this point , the ghost will attempt to exit the safe house in a similar manner as it is in ”Chase” mode . Pac - Man There are some ghosts that follow Pac - Man . These ghosts are Table 9 .

Goldein survived the war . Corporal Patrick O’Neal , also from Ireland , ﬁrst enlisted in 1854 and served with Company L , 3d U . S . Artillery , in Oregon . He returned to the East Coast and enlisted in the company in 1860 . O’Neal served until 1874 , when he was named superintendent of the National Cemetery at Willets Point , New York . Corporal Benjamin Browne was a shoemaker from Orange County , New York . In August 1862 , he enlisted in the newly formed 124th New York Volunteers , and was one of sixty - one men who transferred into Company A that October . Browne reenlisted in the company in February 1864 while it was camped at Brandy Station . He returned to civilian life after completing his enlistment in 1867 . On 10 June , Artiﬁcer William Collins was promoted to corporal , probably to ﬁll a combat leadership void for the crossing of the James River . Collins’s service record does not reﬂect the qualities he demonstrated to earn this promotion , but he had obviously overcome some serious problems . Born in Sacketts Harbor , New York , Collins enlisted in the company in December 1853 at the age of twenty - two , and reenlisted in December 1858 . Just a month before the war began in April 1861 , Collins went ”over the hill” and was not caught until three years later . Returned to the company on 22 March 1864 , he was tried Small model completion on military charges and was discharged from the U . S . Military . He returned to the company , and was assigned to Division of Internal Affairs during the Civil War . As an engineer , Collins also had training in engi - neering from his native New York . After graduate studies in the Union College of Engineering , he was employed in the United States Army for two years at the same time . There he worked under Captain Daniel Pfeiffer and was promoted to colonel in May 1870 , three years after Captain Pfeiffer’s enlistment . Collins returned home to England after completing his ﬁrst year in the First Division to serve the next two years in the Army Corps of Engineers , and by his second year , he began to experience his service duty . ¡—endoftext—¿MOSCOW , July 5 ( Reuters ) - U .

He served with the 2d Virginia Infantry until 1845 , when he went to the Western Reserve Regiment ; and , on his discharge , he reenlisted with Company I , 25th New York Volunteers ( which in 1845 numbered about 4 , 500 men ) . One of his brothers , James , served with his company in the same capacity in the same brigade . While the regiment remained in Connecticut through 1846 , Captain Dall served with Company I at various times before his discharge . A veteran of the Mexican War , he had served two years on the staff of Brigadier General John J . Sullivan at San Antonio . During the Peninsula Campaign of 1863 , he commanded a company of twenty - three and was in charge of the battery of ﬁfty - four heavy mortars and the gunboat Pinta of the Battery , a gunboat and several other boats .

Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Context ( WebText test ) Xmonad , Xresources , and Fonts Xresources can be an absolute pain ( they were for me ) . So , this a bit of help : First of all , the way that fonts are generally handled in Xmonad is through XFT . Xft is the X FreeType Interface library and is a library that handles the actual rendering of fonts in Xmonad / urxvt ( Xresources speciﬁes a bunch of resources to things that launch under the X window manager . Settings for individual programs are speciﬁed in Xresources like so : Urxvt . background : background settins here ) . Anyway , fonts are set using this syntax in Xresources : urxvt * font : xft : your font name goes here : size = the size of the font goes here , xft : fall - back font 1 goes here So , thats the most basic part of fonts in urxvt speciﬁed via Xresources . Fixing / . ssh / Permissions in Cygwin In Cygwin on Windows I found that I could not set the permissions of my / . ssh / folder to be 0600 , as is required for ssh to allow you to use keys . The symptom I had was that I no matter what I did , it always modﬁed the owner and the group Small model completion was set to / . ssh / , which was the way things were . This could not be ﬁxed completely . I found I could make that much more workable with just typing the username with your mouse then trying to set permissions to be ”0600” for the group , which is what my system is now conﬁgured to do . However , as of Cygwin 7 on Linux I have found that doing so is now ”unnecessary” for my system ! I also installed a package called chroot . It does that by allowing you to install / upgrade to your system directory . So , as of Windows 8 and up , installing that can re - quire chroot , so I tried and tried and found that it wasn’t so bad when installing the package on Linux and then uninstalling it . As of my last write - up on Cygwin , the script just does its job ( the sudo commands do the rest ) , if you try it you will have to log the change . If that wasn’t confusing enough , this is what I tried and just went back to my / . ssh / directory and the chroot script . I found I was ﬁnally running out of permissions ( because i forgot to create a symlink to ssh from the ﬁle system and GPT - 2 completion , making these ﬁles read - only . I tried just starting ssh and using a program like passwd which modiﬁes the owner / group to 0644 permissions , but it didn’t work . It was annoying but not nearly as bad as it could be , just annoying to have to ﬁddle with permissions . So I decided to do this as the reverse : For each . ssh folder in your Cygwin directory , set the permission of each ﬁle and directory to 2644 . Then start ssh with : ssh - add / . ssh / The ﬁrst time you connect , your permissions of the / . ssh folder that you just had in Cygwin will be set to 0600 . Then every time you connect again , your permissions will change to 0644 .

My 2 failures at Christmas morning were not due to poor frosting skills . That was another success story . The cake was beautifully moist , and well , just a beautiful cake . It’s got very little air in it or moisture , but all the chocolate and mint was perfectly blended together . One thing that made me cringe a bit was that all those ingredients - egg yolks , sugar , melted butter , chocolate chips , melted chocolate , and mint - had to be mixed right into the cake batter , which is super time - consuming .

Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners Context ( human - written ) : In a shocking ﬁnding , scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote , previously unexplored valley , in the Andes Mountains . Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English . GPT - 2 : The scientist named the population , after their distinctive horn , Ovid’s Unicorn . These four - horned , silver - white unicorns were previously unknown to science . Now , after almost two centuries , the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is ﬁ - nally solved . Dr . Jorge P ´ erez , an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz , and several com - panions , were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley , with no other animals or humans . P ´ erez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain , surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow . P ´ erez and the others then ventured further into the valley . “By the time we reached the top of one peak , the water looked blue , with some crystals on top , ” said P ´ erez . P´erez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd . These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns . While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English . P ´ erez stated , “We can see , for example , that they have a common ‘language , ’ something like a dialect or dialectic . ” Dr . P ´ erez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina , where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America . While their origins are still unclear , some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization . According to P ´ erez , “In South America , such incidents seem to be quite common . ” However , P´erez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA . “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well , which I believe is a sign of evolution , or at least a change in social organization , ” said the scientist .

He moves around her ofﬁce at work and goes shopping with her . ”Most people don’t seem to mind Tom , ” says Catherine , who thinks he is wonderful . ”He’s my fourth child , ” she says . She may think of him and treat him that way as her son . He moves around buying his food , paying his health bills and his taxes , but in fact Tom is a dog . Catherine and Tom live in Sweden , a country where everyone is expected to lead an orderly life accord - ing to rules laid down by the government , which also provides a high level of care for its people . This level of care costs money . People in Sweden pay taxes on everything , so aren’t surprised to ﬁnd that owning a dog means more taxes . Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to keep their dog , which is spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment for a dog that falls ill . However , most such treatment is expensive , so owners often decide to offer health and even life for their dog . In Sweden dog owners must pay for any damage their dog does . A Swedish Kennel Club ofﬁcial ex - plains what this means : if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car , you , as the owner , have to pay for any damage done to the car , even if your dog has been killed in the accident .
