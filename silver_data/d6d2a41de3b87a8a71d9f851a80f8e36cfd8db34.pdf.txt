Response to abiotic and organic substances stimulation belongs to ontologic groups significantly up - regulated in porcine immature oocytes Abstract The efficiency of the process of obtaining mature oocytes , and then of porcine embryos in vitro depends on many factors and requires meeting many conditions . These include selection of morphologically ap - propriate oocytes , selection of appropriate medium components , as well as a number of abiotic factors ( appropriate microenvironment during in vitro culture ) . Oocytes were taken from 45 pubertal crossbred Landrace gilts . The BCB test was carried out . BCB + oocy - tes were divided into two groups : “before IVM” and “after IVM” . “Before IVM” oocytes were subjected to molecular analyzes immediately after collection , while “after IVM” oocytes underwent in vitro maturation and then the second BCB test . Oocytes that remained BCB + after the second test were used for molecular analyzes using Affymetrix expression microarrays . A group of genes responsible for response to organic substance and response to abiotic stimulus , which underwent significant changes ( decrease ) was discovered after oocyte in vitro maturation . Genes such as MM , PLDP , SERPINH , MYOF , DHX9 , HSPA5 , VCP , KIT , SERPINH1 , PLD1 , and VCP showed the largest decrease after the culture period . The levels of these genes were therefore elevated in oocytes before the in vitro maturation process . In conclusion , a number of organic and abiotic factors have an impact on the process of the oocyte in vi - tro maturation . The presented results confirm the literature data in which the low efficiency of obtaining mature oocytes in in vitro conditions is mentioned , which further impacts the amount of viable embryos obtained .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 92 Introduction The procedure of in vitro pig embryo production consists of several very important , inseparable stag - es : oocyte procurement , oocyte in vitro maturation , oocyte fertilization and in vitro embryo culture [ 1 ] . The literature provides clear evidence that in vitro matured oocytes are significantly reduced in quality compared to oocytes maturing under physi - ological conditions . The reduced quality of acquired oocytes results in reduced survival and the ability to undergo fertilization . This result is a reduced num - ber of embryos obtained [ 2 ] . The process of oocyte maturation in both physio - logical and in vitro conditions consists of many stag - es , with various underlying contributing factors . Under physiological conditions , from the moment of recruitment of the primary follicle until the mo - ment of ovulation , the process of oocyte maturation occurs . It involves the synthesis and accumulation of appropriate compounds and redistribution of cell organelles inside the oocyte , necessary for the process of fertilization and early embryo develop - ment [ 3 ] . During the aforementioned cytoplasmic maturation of the oocyte , it increases its volume ( about 300 times ) and the diameter ( from 15µ m to 100 µm ) . In this time , the oocyte is very active . It is subject to the transcription and translation process , thanks to which it contains about 200 times more RNA and 20 times more proteins than the somatic cell . During the resumption of the meiosis process , the transcription stops and the translation process is continued [ 4 ] . The first stem of the nuclear maturation process of the oocyte is the resumption and completion of the first meiotic division , followed by the begin - ning of the second division and its arrest in the metaphase II stage [ 5 ] . During nuclear maturation , the nuclear envelope disappears , haploidization of the genetic material occurs and the first direction - al body is ejected . The physiological signal for the resumption of meiosis is the sudden increase in luteinizing hormone ( LH ) . The effect of its action is a decrease in cAMP concentration in oolema , cAMP - dependent kinase activity inactivating matu - ration promoting factors ( MPF ) [ 6 ] . MPF is respon - sible for the regulation of mechanisms controlling meiosis and the entire cell cycle . The activity of this factor causes the inhibition of transcription and the continuation of the meiotic division [ 7 ] . It is believed that it is much harder in an in vitro environment to acquire full cytoplasmic maturity . In recent years , the conditions of in vitro oocytes cultures have been optimalized , thanks to which a large number of oocytes are obtained at the stage of metaphase II [ 8 ] . Many biotic and abiotic factors influence the process of oocytes maturation in vitro . First of all , it is the selection of appropriate oocytes , morphologically unchanged after the procurement process , with homogeneous cytoplasm , surrounded by a compact group of cumulus cells . Another very important factor is the selection of an appropriate culture medium . The medium should contain prop - erly selected ingredients [ 8 ] . Also factors such as the culture microenvironment is very important during the in vitro maturation process [ 9 , 10 ] . The present article focuses on genes that show reduced expression after in vitro oocytes culture in response to organic substances and abiotic stimulus . Material and Methods Parts of the materials and methods were already described in a different work by our group [ 11 ] . Animals A total of 45 pubertal crossbred Landrace gilts , with a median age of 170 days and weight of 98 kg , were used in this study . The animals were bred under the same conditions . Experiments were ap - proved by the Local Ethics Committee in Poznan ( Resolution No . 83 / 2012 / DNT ) . Collection of porcine ovaries and cumulus - oo - cyte - complexes ( COCs ) The ovaries and reproductive tracts were recov - ered at slaughter and transported to the laboratory within 10 min . at 38o C . in 0 . 9 % NaCl . To provide optimal conditions for subsequent oocyte matura - tion and fertilization in vitro , the ovaries of each an - imal were placed in 5 % fetal bovine serum solution ( FBS ; Sigma - Aldrich Co . , St . Louis , MO , USA ) in PBS [ 12 , 13 ] . Thereafter , single large follicles ( > 5mm ) were opened , in a sterile Petri dish , by puncturing with a 5 - mL syringe and 20 - G needle , to recover the COCs . The COCs were washed three times in modi - fied PBS supplemented with 36 µg / mL pyruvate , 50 µg / mL gentamicin , and 0 . 5 mg / mL BSA ( Sigma - Al - drich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . COCs were selected under an inverted microscope - Zeiss , Axiovert 35 ( Lübeck , Germany ) , counted , and morphologically evaluated with special care , using the scale suggested by Pujol et al . and Le Guienne et al . [ 14 , 15 ] . Grade I : COCs with a homogeneous cytoplasm and a complete cumulus oophorus Grade II : COCs with an incomplete but compact cumulus oophorus with more than five layers and a homogeneous cytoplasm Grade III : COCs with a heterogeneous cytoplasm and more than three cumulus cells layers or more than five layers in some parts . Grade IV : COCs with cumulus oophorus partly or to - tally absent and cytoplasm strongly heterogeneous . ” Only COCs of grade I with homogeneous cyto - plasm and uniform and compact cumulus cells were considered for use in the following steps of the ex - periment , resulting in the use of a total of 300 grade I oocytes that were determined positive in Brilliant Cresyl Blue ( BCB ) test . Kranc et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 93 Assessment of oocyte developmental competence by BCB test Brilliant Cresyl Blue ( BCB ) test , which measures the activity of glucose - 6 - phosphate ( G6PDH ) en - zyme , was used for assessment of oocytes’ quality and maturity [ 16 ] . The G6PDH enzyme converts BCB stain from blue to colourless . In oocytes that completed their growth , the activity of the enzyme decreases and the stain cannot be reduced , result - ing in blue oocytes ( BCB + ) . To run the BCB staining test , oocytes were washed two times in modified Dulbecco PBS ( DPBS ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) supplemented with 50 IU / mL penicillin , 50 µg / mL streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 0 . 4 % [ w / v ] BSA , 0 . 34 mM pyruvate , and 5 . 5 mM glucose ( DPBSm ) . Thereafter , they were treated with 13 µM BCB ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) diluted in DPBSm at 38 . 5°C , 5 % CO2 in air for 90 min . After treatment , the oocytes were transferred to DPBSm and washed two times . During the wash - ing procedure , the oocytes were examined under an inverted microscope and classified as either having stained blue ( BCB + ) or remained colourless ( BCB – ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Immature oocytes have compact cumulus cell layers which need to be removed for further oo - cyte evaluation , regardless if the oocyte will be later analyzed as “before IVM” group or set to undergo IVM . Therefore , the BCB + COCs were first incubat - ed with bovine testicular hyaluronidase ( Sigma - Al - drich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) for 2 min at 38o C , to sep - arate cumulus and granulosa cells . Afterwards , cells were removed by vortexing the BCB + oocytes in 1 % sodium citrate buffer and by mechanical displace - ment using a small - diameter glass micropipette . Only the granulosa - cell - free BCB + oocytes were used for subsequent IVM , microarray and RT - qPCR analysis . Overall , 150 immature oocytes were quali - fied as “before IVM” , analyzed straight after the COC shedding , with the rest directed for in vitro matura - tion ( “after IVM” ) and subsequent analysis . In vitro maturation of porcine COCs After the first BCB test , the blue stained COCs ( BCB + ) were cultured in Nunclon™Δ 4 - well dishes in 500 μL standard porcine IVM culture medium , TCM - 199 ( tissue culture medium ) , with Earle’s salts and L - glutamine ( Gibco BRL Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , supplemented with 2 . 2 mg / mL sodium bicarbonate ( Nacalai Tesque , Inc . , Kyo - to , Japan ) , 0 . 1 mg / mL sodium pyruvate ( Sigma - Al - drich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 10 mg / mL BSA ( bovine serum albumin ) , ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 0 . 1 mg / mL cysteine ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 10 % ( v / v ) filtered porcine follicular fluid and gonadotropin supplements at final concentra - tions of 2 . 5 IU / mL hCG ( Ayerst Laboratories , Inc . , Philadelphia , PA , USA ) and 2 . 5 IU / mL eCG ( Inter - vet , Whitby , ON , Canada ) . Wells were covered with mineral oil overlay and cultured at 38° C , under 5 % CO2 , for 22h , and then for additional 22h in medium without hormones . After maturation , the BCB stain - ing test was performed again and BCB + oocytes were used for further molecular analyses . Based on visual analysis under an inverted microscope , around 70 % of oocytes were determined as BCB + . This makes the final number of “after IVM” oocytes around 105 out of the initial 150 . RNA extraction from porcine oocytes Total RNA was extracted from all the samples ( both before and after IVM ) , using TRI Reagent ( Sig - ma , St Louis , MO , USA ) and RNeasy MinElute Clean - up Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . The amount of to - tal mRNA was determined from the optical density at 260 nm , while the RNA purity was estimated us - ing the 260 / 280 nm absorption ratio ( higher than 1 . 8 ) ( NanoDrop spectrophotometer , Thermo Scien - tific , ALAB , Poland ) . The RNA integrity and quality were checked on a Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent Tech - nologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The resulting RNA integrity numbers ( RINs ) were between 8 . 5 and 10 with an average of 9 . 2 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The RNA in each sample was diluted to a concentration of 100 ng / μL with an OD260 / OD280 ratio of 1 . 8 / 2 . 0 . From each RNA sample , 100 ng of RNA was taken for the microar - ray analysis . The remaining amount of isolated RNA was used for RT - qPCR study . Microarray expression analysis and statistics The Affymetrix procedure was described pre - viously in our papers [ 17 , 18 ] . cDNA was reverse transcribed from Total RNA ( 100 ng ) ( Ambion® WT Expression Kit ; Ambion , Austin , TX , USA ) . Ob - tained cDNA was biotin labelled and fragmented by Affymetrix GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling and Hybridization ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Biotin - labelled fragments of cDNA ( 5 . 5 μg ) were hybridized to Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Ar - ray Strip ( 48°C / 20 h ; Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Then , microarrays were washed and stained according to the technical protocol using Affymetrix GeneAtlas Fluidics Station . Subsequently , the array strips were scanned by Imaging Station of GeneAt - las System . The preliminary analysis of the scanned chips was performed using Affymetrix GeneAtlasTM Op - erating Software ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The quality of gene expression data was checked according to quality control criteria provided by the software . Obtained CEL files were imported into downstream data analysis software . All of the pre - sented analyses and graphs were performed using Bioconductor and R programming language . Each CEL file was merged with a description file . In or - der to correct background , normalize and summa - rize results , we used Robust Multiarray Averaging ( RMA ) algorithm . Kranc et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 94 Statistical significance of analyzed genes was per - formed by moderated t - statistics from the empiri - cal Bayes method . Obtained p - value was corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s false discovery rate . The selection of significantly changed gene expression was based on p - value beneath 0 . 05 and expression fold higher than 2 . All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica software ( Version 13 . 3 ; StatSoft , Poland ) . Differentially expressed genes were subjected to the selection of genes associated with a cellular component of morphogenesis . Differentially ex - pressed gene lists ( separate for up and down - reg - ulated genes ) were uploaded to DAVID software ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Inte - grated Discovery ; Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc . , National Cancer Institute , Frederick , MD , USA ) . Such analysis allowed us to extract significantly enriched gene sets from Gene Ontology ( GO ) Biological Pro - cess ( BP ) database . Subsequently set of differentially expressed genes from “response to abiotic stimulus” and “re - sponse to organic substances” GO BP terms , were applied to STRING software ( Search Tool for the Re - trieval of Interacting Genes / Proteins ; STRING Con - sortium ) for interactions prediction . STRING is a huge database contains information about protein / gene interactions , including experimental data , computational prediction methods and public text collections . The further investigation of the studied GO terms , we have calculated the z - score ( the num - ber of up - regulated genes minus the number of down - regulated genes divided by the square root of the count ) analysis with GOplot package [ 19 ] . The results allowed us to investigate the enrichment of those two GO BP terms . Ethical approval The research related to animal use has been com - plied with all the relevant national regulations and instructional policies for the care and use of animals . Bioethical Committee approval no . 83 / 2012 / DNT . Results Profiling of the whole transcriptome of the oocyte by Affymetrix microarray allowed us to analyze gene expression changes after in vitro maturation ( after IVM ) in relation to the freshly isolated oocyte , before in vitro procedure ( before IVM ) . Using Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array , ( available in GEO database , accession : GSE97246 ) , we examined the expression of 12258 porcine transcripts ( microarray data : sup - plementary materials ) . We considered genes of fold change higher than | 2 | , and with a corrected p - value lower than 0 . 05 , as differentially expressed . This set of genes consists of 419 different transcripts . The first detailed analysis based on GO BP allowed us to iden - tify 51 significantly enriched GO BP terms . Among them , we focused on from “response to abiotic stimu - lus” and “response to organic substances” . The genes that belong to this term were subjected to hierarchi - cal clusterization algorithm and presented as a heat - map graph ( Fig . 1 ) . The gene symbols , fold changes in expression , Entrez gene IDs and corrected p values of that genes were shown in table 1 .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 95 each GO BP term was calculated and shown on the circle diagram ( Fig . 2 ) Moreover , genes that formed one particular GO group in the Gene Ontology database can also be - long to other different GO term categories . For this reason , we explore the gene intersections between selected GO BP terms . The relation between those GO BP terms was presented as circle plot ( Fig . 3 ) as well as a heatmap ( Fig . 4 ) . STRING interaction network was generated among differentially expressed genes belonging to each of selected GO BP terms . Using such a predic - tion method provided us with a molecular interac - tion network formed between protein products of studied genes ( Fig . 5 ) . Finally , we investigated the functional interactions between chosen genes with REACTOME FIViz app to Cytoscape 3 . 6 . 0 software . The results were shown in ( Fig . 6 ) .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 97 Discussion In the presented article , we have analysed two groups of genes characterizing the response of oocytes to organic substance and abiotic stimulus from the external environment before in vitro cul - ture and after in vitro culture . The obtained results suggest that both of those groups of genes show significantly higher expres - sion before IVM . “Response to the organic substance” GO contains genes contributing to the processes that change the state or activity of a given cell ( in terms of secretion , enzymatic activity , gene expression ) under the in - fluence of a specific organic substance . In turn , the “response to abiotic stimulus” ontological group de - scribes a group of genes that causes a change in the state or activity of a cell under the influence of an abiotic factor . FIGURE 4 Heatmap showing the gene occurrence “response to abiotic stimulus” and “response to organic substances” . GO BP terms FIGURE 5 STRING - generated interaction network among differentially expressed genes belonging to the “response to abiotic stimulus” and “response to organic substances” GO BP terms . The intensity of the edges reflects the strength of interaction score Kranc et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 98 Genes such as GJA1 , APP , MAP3K1 , KIT , DHX9 , MYOF - are characteristic for the “response to abiot - ic stimulus” ontological group and have been shown to increase their expression prior to oocyte culture . The change in these genes’ expression drastically decreases after in vitro culture , and thus oocytes are less responsive to stimulation with abiotic factors after in vitro culture . The first of presented gene , the GJA1 ( Gap Junc - tion protein alpha - 1 ) is a gene coding for membrane proteins - connexin ( Cxs ) , primarily Cx43 . Cxs is a group of membrane proteins that build slot chan - nels that connect the cytoplasm of two neighbour - ing cells . This intercellular channel consists of 2 hemicalanals . Each such hemicanals consists of 6 Cx proteins . Cx43 , as mentioned above , is present in many tissues and cells [ 22 ] . Many publications indicate that the GJA1 gene represents a potential genetic marker associated with oocyte maturation and developmental competence of the obtained em - bryos [ 21 , 22 ] . Our studies have shown the association of GJA1 with the FOS gene . In turn , FOS shows dependence with many other genes , as indicated by the STRING analysis . FOS has a critical function in regulating the development of cells designed to create a skeleton . It is also believed that FOS proteins are responsi - ble for the proliferation , differentiation and trans - formation of cells [ 23 ] . This may concern even ad - ipocytes [ 24 ] . We also know that the expression of genes from the FOS group ( exactly c - FOS ) is caused by extracellular stress [ 25 ] . The next gene is a MAP3K1 ( Mitogen - Activated Kinase 1 ) . It is a mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase that regulates the MAPK and JNK pathways . MAP3K1 is a factor that generates antiapoptotic sig - nals , but may also induce apoptosis under certain conditions ( after cleavage by caspase ) [ 26 ] . MAP3K1 is also involved in the process of cell migration . Ex - pression of this gene was increased in oocytes be - fore in vitro culture [ 27 ] . Increased expression prior to the in vitro culture of oocytes is also shown by the Kit gene ( Stem cell factor receptor ) . KIT is necessary for the growth of germ cells both in vivo and in vitro . In addition , the Kit signalling pathway controls the proliferation of primary germ cells [ 28 ] . KIT is a receptor found in oocytes and theca cells . This gene also participates in the regulation of the process of folliculogenesis and oogenesis . KIT interacts with KIT LIGAND . The initiation of follicle growth from the original pool and their increase includes the KIT - KIT LIGAND in - teractions . During early ovarian follicle growth , KIT controls the growth of oocyte and cell differentia - tion , protecting the follicles against apoptosis . Also , the production of the antral cavity requires the effi - FIGURE 6 Functional interaction ( FI ) between differentially expressed genes belonging to the “response to abiotic stim - ulus” and “response to organic substances” GO BP terms .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 99 cient functioning of the KIT - KIT LIGAND system . In mature ovarian follicles , this system is responsible for the ability of the ovum to mature its cytoplasmic components [ 29 ] . Another gene that has a higher expression before the oocyte in vitro culture is MMP14 ( Matrix Metal - loproteinase 14 ) . It is a gene characteristic for both of the analysed ontological groups . MMP14 , as a member of the MMP protein family , is involved in the remodelling of the extracellular matrix associat - ed with embryonic development . The MMP system , to which the MMP14 protein belongs , regulates many dynamic processes occurring in the ovary and uterus [ 30 ] . KIT Ligand ( KL ) is a product of gran - ulosa cells in ovarian follicles . It is also believed to be a regulator of oocyte development . There is a hypothesis that the oocytes regulate the level of Kit Ligand mRNA expression . The development and growth of ovarian follicles are associated with an in - crease in the level of KL mRNA expression in granu - losa cells . The presence of the oocyte in the culture caused an increase or decrease in the level of KL mRNA in granulosa cells depending on the absence or presence of FSH . It turns out , therefore , that the expression of the Kit gene depends on the presence of hormones in the culture , but also on the oocytes themselves that affect the granulosa cells [ 31 ] . SERPINH1 , PLD1 , and VCP have shown the high - est expression among genes belonging to “response to organic substance” ontological group . Ikegawa et al . noticed that SERPIN H1 gene ( Ser - pin Peptidase inhibitor , clade H , member 1 ) could respond and play an important role , together with retinoic acid , in the process of induced differentia - tion with into chondrocytes [ 32 ] . Another gene showing a high decrease after in vitro culture is PLD1 ( Phospholipase D1 ) . The activ - ity of PLD family proteins is associated with many cellular pathways ( signal transduction , membrane transport ) . Hammond et al . showed that the protein has strong catalytic and regulatory properties . They were the first to suggest that PLD1 may affect the change in cell morphology as well as intracellular protein transport [ 33 ] . Conclusions In this article , we focused primarily on genes that show the highest expression change . It turns out that they are involved in the processes associated with the proper functioning of the ovary and the maturation of the oocytes . In addition , genes be - longing to the described ontological groups may be potential molecular markers of response to organic substances , as well as responses to abiotic factors . We could say that the expression of these genes in - creases / is high before oocyte culture in vitro . On the other hand , we can conclude that after in vitro culture the expression of these genes decreases drastically . This may indicate that during the change of abiotic factors , the oocytes reduce their compul - sive competence in order to deescalate their reac - tion to those substances .
