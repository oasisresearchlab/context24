Epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) plays an important role in invasion and migration of cancer cells . We presumed that CCL21 / CCR7 axis activates EMT process to induce cancer cell invasion and metastasis . Firstly , the expressions of CCR7 and EMT markers were examined by immunohistochemical staining in the primary breast carcinoma tissues from 60 patients who underwent radical mastectomy . Then , we investigated whether CCL21 / CCR7 induces EMT process during mediating cancer cell invasion or migration in vitro . By immunohis - tolochemistry , high expressions of CCR7 , Slug and N - cadherin were seen in 60 , 65 , and 76 . 67 % of tumors , respectively , and signiﬁcantly associated with lymph node metastases as well as clinical pathological stage . Further - more , the CCR7 expression was signiﬁcantly correlated to Slug and N - cadherin . In vitro , stimulating breast cancer cell lines 1428 , MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 with CCL21 , the invasion and migration of tumor cells were promoted , and simultaneously , EMT phenotype of tumor cells was enhanced , including down - regulation of E - cadherin , up - regulation of Slug , Vimentin and N - cadherin at both pro - tein and mRNA levels . Inversely , knockdown of CCR7 by shRNA suppressed tumor cell invasion , migration and EMT phenotype induced by CCL21 . These results indi - cated that CCL21 / CCR7 axis could activate EMT process during chemotaxis of breast carcinoma cells .

Although the survival rate of breast cancer patients has constantly increased with the improvement of early stage diagnosis and therapy in recent years [ 1 ] , cancer metastasis on early stage is still a key factor leading to recurrence [ 2 , 3 ] . Previous studies have demonstrated that chemokines and their receptors could promote not only immune cell activity and chemotaxis , but also cancer cell dissemination and metastasis [ 4 ] . Chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 , sharing a common receptor CCR7 , are released by secondary lymphoid organs , for example , lymph nodes , Peyer’s patches , spleen and endothelium of small lymphatics in multiple organs [ 5 – 8 ] . Chemokine receptor CCR7 , as a G protein - coupled and 7 - span transmembrane protein , is expressed in T cells and mature dendritic cells ( DCs ) . CCR7 binding with its ligands could promote immune cell viability and induce immune cells homing to secondary lymphoid organs in immunologic and inﬂammatory processes [ 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 ] . Subsequent studies revealed that several chemokines and their receptors , such as SDF - 1 / CXCR4 and CCL19 or CCL21 / CCR7 , could promote cancer cell dissemination and metastasis [ 4 ] .

However , little is known about molecular mechanisms by which CCR7 mediate tumor cell migration to lymph nodes . Epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , a phenome - non occurring during embryonic development , has been implicated in development of human diseases , including chronic inﬂammation , organ ﬁbrosis , cancer dissemination and so on [ 12 ] . Epithelial cells undergo phenotype trans - formation during EMT , e . g . , loss of E - cadherin , gain of Snail , Slug , N - cadherin and Vimentin [ 13 ] . Until now , it has been conﬁrmed that many factors could trigger the EMT , for instance , transforming growth factor - b ( TGF - b ) , insulin growth factor ( IGF ) , platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) [ 12 ] . Recent years , chemokine SDF - 1 and its receptor CXCR4 , most commonly expressed in multiple carcinomas , were reported to stimulate EMT in some cancer cells [ 14 – 16 ] . CCR7 and its ligand CCL19 or CCL21 are also com - monly expressed in multiple carcinomas , whereas the role of CCL19 or CCL21 / CCR7 in EMT remains unclear . In the present study , we investigated whether CCL21 / CCR7 axis could stimulate breast cancer cells to acquire EMT phenotype during cell invasion and migration . Materials and methods Tissue preparation A total of 60 cases of female breast carcinoma parafﬁn - embedded tissues were selected , which had been clinically and histopathologically diagnosed in Shandong Tumor Hospital . None of the patients had received radiation therapy or chemotherapy before surgery . The TNM staging system of the UICC was used to classify the specimens . Clinicopathological information of the patients about age , sex , tumor size , histological type , stage and lymph node metastasis were obtained from patient records , and sum - marized in Table 1 . The procedure in the present study has been approved by Hospital Ethical Committee of the Shandong University . All the samples included in this study were completely anonymized . Immunohistochemical staining About 5 - l m - thick sections were prepared from parafﬁn - embedded tissues . Immunohistochemical staining was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions . Brieﬂy , tissues sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in a graded alcohol series . Antigen retrieval was carried out in a hot 0 . 01 mol / L citrate buffer at 100 (cid:3) C for 15 min and then cooled at room temperature . Slides were immersed in 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to inacti - vate endogenous peroxidase . Sections were incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with primary antibodies : anti - CCR7 at 1 : 300 dilution ( Abcam ) , anti - N - cadherin at 1 : 200 dilution ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and anti - Slug at 1 : 200 dilution ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , respectively . For negative control , primary antibodies were replaced by PBS . Sections were treated with EnVision System ( DAKO ) , visualized for primary antibodies with DAB and counterstained for nuclei with hematoxylin . Evaluation of immunohistochemistry The immunostain scoring was based on positive percentage and staining intensity in at least ﬁve high - power ﬁelds for each section ( 400 9 magniﬁcation ) . The immunostaining intensity was scored as follows compared with the back - ground staining : 0 , none ; 1 , mild ; 2 , moderate ; and 3 , intense . The percentage of positive tumor cells were assessed according to the following patterns : 0 , 0 % cells ; 1 , 0 – 25 % cells ; 2 , 25 – 50 % cells ; 3 , [ 50 % cells .

The tissue sections were ﬁnally determined as negative or low expression when score was less than 4 , or as positive or high expression when score was equal to or more than 4 . Cell culture and reagents The human breast cancer cell lines 1428 , MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) . The cell lines were cultured in DMEM ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Gibco ) and 100 U / mL penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere contain - ing 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:3) C . Cell lines were stimulated with or without CCL21 ( PeproTech ) at designed concentrations and times to analyze the effect of CCL21 / CCR7 axis on the expressions of EMT biomarkers and the capacities of cell migration and invasion . Depletion of CCR7 expression by shRNA For interference of CCR7 expression , 2 9 10 5 cells were seeded in a six - well plate and cultured overnight , and trans - fected with CCR7 shRNA or control shRNA plasmid ( Invit - rogen ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacture’s instruction . The shRNA target sequences were as follows : CCR7 siRNA 5 0 - AGCTTGTTCTTTGTTC TTT - 3 0 ( 17428 ) , CCR7 siRNA 5 0 - TCAGTAAGCAACTCA ACAT - 3 0 ( 17432 ) , control siRNA 5 0 - GGAATCTCATTCGA TGCATAC - 3 0 . The CCR7 shRNA that could effectively deplete CCR7 at both RNA and protein levels was used in the following experiments . Western blot analysis Total protein was extracted from cultured cells by cell lysis buffer and quantiﬁed using the BSA method . Equal amount of protein for each sample was separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel ( SDS - PAG ) , and elec - trotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane ( Invitrogen ) . The membranes were blocked with 5 % BSA in Tris - buf - fered saline Tween 20 ( TBST ) , and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with primary antibodies : 1 : 1 , 000 dilution for CCR7 ( Abcom ) , 1 : 1 , 000 dilution for E - cadherin ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , 1 : 200 dilution for N - cadherin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1 : 1 , 000 dilution for Vimentin ( Cell Sig - naling Technology ) , 1 : 200 dilution for Slug ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and 1 : 2 , 000 dilution for b - actin ( Cell Sig - naling Technology ) . The membranes were washed by TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conju - gated secondary antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Immunocomplexe blots were visualized by chemilumines - cence luminol reagent ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Real - time PCR assay Total RNA were isolated from cell lines using Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and reversely transcribed into cDNA using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The target mRNA expressions were detected by real - time PCR . First strand cDNA were ampliﬁed using Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , and PCR products were timely quantiﬁed by a Mx4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System ( Stratagene ) equipped with version 3 . 0 software . Total sample RNA was normalized to endogenous GADPH mRNA . Relative target gene expression was calculated by the comparative C T - method , using GAPDH as the normalization control [ 17 ] . The primers ( BioSune ) for the respective genes were designed as follows : CCR7 forward 5 0 - TACCTACCTGCT CAACCTG - 3 0 and reverse 5 0 - AAAAGTGGACACCGAA GA - 3 0 ; E - cadherin forward 5 0 - CTGAGAACGAGGCTAA CG - 3 0 and reverse 5 0 - GTCCACCATCATCATTCAATAT - 3 0 ; Vimentin forward 5 0 - TCCGCCAGCAGTATGAAAG - 3 0 and reverse 5 0 - TGGGTGTCAACCAGAGGAAG - 3 0 ; N - cadherin forward 5 0 - GCGCGTGAAGGTTTGCCAGTG - 3 0 and reverse 5 0 - CCGGCGTTTCATCCATACCACAA - 3 0 ; Slug forward 5 0 - CAGCTCAGGAGCATACAG - 3 0 and reverse 5 0 - GAGGAGGTGTCAGATGGA - 3 0 ; GADPH forward 5 0 - GCCGCATCTTCTTTTGCGTCGC - 3 0 and reverse 5 0 - TCCCGTTCTCAGCCTTGACGGT - 3 0 . Wound - healing assay For assessing migration capacity of cancer cells , human breast cancer cells were seeded in six - well culture dishes and incubated with DMEM containing 10 % FBS and with or without 100 ng / mL of CCL21 . When the cells grew to a conﬂuent monolayer , a scratch was performed with a pip - ette tip to form a linear wound in the central area of cell monolayer , and detached cells were removed carefully with PBS . After incubation for 48 h , migrated cells in wound areas were counted under a phase - contrast microscope . The wound - healing assay was performed in triplicate . Matrigel invasion assay Human breast cancer cell invasion was assessed by transwell chamber having a ﬁlter with 6 . 5 mm in diameter and 8 mm Med Oncol ( 2014 ) 31 : 180 Page 3 of 10 180 123 size pores ( BD Biosciences ) . The transwell ﬁlter was pre - coated with basement membrane matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) . 5 9 10 5 cells , pretreated with or without 100 ng / mL of CCL21 for 48 h , suspended in DMEM containing 1 % FBS , were seeded on matrigel in the upper chamber . DMEM containing 10 % FBS was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant . After incubation for 48 h , noninvasive cells on the upper surface of the ﬁlter were removed com - pletely by cotton swabs . The invasive cells that adhered to the lower surface of the ﬁlter were ﬁxed with methanol and stained with crystal violet . Then , the number of invaded cells was counted under a light microscope . These experiments were performed in triplicate . Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17 . 0 software . All data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation . v 2 test was used for assessing the relationship between CCR7 and EMT biomarkers in human breast cancer tissues . Student’s t test was used for comparing differences between means of different groups . Results were considered statistically signiﬁcant when p \ 0 . 05 . Results CCR7 expression correlated with N - cadherin / Slug expression and clinicopathological parameters in human breast carcinoma tissues To evaluate the role of CCR7 in breast carcinoma , we detected the expression of CCR7 , N - cadherin and Slug expressions in female breast carcinoma tissues by immu - nohistochemistry . High expressions of CCR7 , N - cadherin and Slug were detected in 60 . 00 % ( 36 / 60 ) , 76 . 67 ( 46 / 60 ) and 65 . 00 % ( 40 / 60 ) , respectively , in cancer tissues . CCR7 and N - cadherin were expressed in cytoplasms and / or plasma membranes of tumor cells , and Slug was expressed mainly in nucleus and partly in cytoplasm of cancer cells ( Fig . 1 ) . Additionally , CCR7 , N - cadherin and Slug were also detected in some of the cases of interstitial stromal cells in cancer regions and or in nonneoplastic tissue adjacent to carcinoma . Association between the biomarkers CCR7 / N - cadherin / Slug expressions and clinical parameters was analyzed statistically as in Table 1 . CCR7 , N - cadherin and Slug expressions were signiﬁcantly associated with lymph node metastasis ( p = 0 . 006 , p = 0 . 011 , p = 0 . 017 ) Fig . 1 Immunohistochemical detection for expressions of CCR7 , N - cadherin and Slug in human breast carcinoma tissues . a – c CCR7 ( a ) and N - cadherin ( b ) were strongly stained in cytoplasm and / or plasma membrane of human breast cancer cells ; Slug ( c ) was stained mainly in nucleus and partly in cytoplasm of cancer cells . e – g Weak stained or unstained CCR7 ( e ) , N - cadherin ( f ) and Slug ( g ) were shown in nonneoplastic tissue adjacent to carcinoma 180 Page 4 of 10 Med Oncol ( 2014 ) 31 : 180 123 and with clinical pathological stage ( p = 0 . 044 , p = 0 . 008 , p = 0 . 028 ) , respectively . Moreover , CCR7 expression was correlated positively with expression of N - cadherin ( r = 0 . 434 , p = 0 . 001 ) and Slug ( r = 0 . 361 , p = 0 . 005 ) ( Table 2 ) . CCL21 promoted CCR7 expression in company with increased expressions of EMT biomarkers in human breast cancer cells To explore the possible role of CCL21 / CCR7 axis in the EMT process of human breast cancer cells , cell lines 1428 , MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 were treated with or without CCL21 in 30 , 50 , 100 ng / mL for 48 h . Data of western blot and real - time PCR showed that CCL21 promoted cancer cells to express both CCR7 and EMT biomarkers in a dose and time - dependent manner , including loss of E - cadherin , gain of Vimentin , N - cadherin and Slug in the three cell lines ( Fig . 2 ) . Knockdown of CCR7 mRNA with shRNA blocked EMT biomarker expression mediated by CCL21 in human breast cancer cells In order to further conﬁrm the role of CCL21 / CCR7 axis in EMT process of breast cancer cells , shRNA was used for depleting CCR7 expression . Data revealed that both sequences of CCR7 shRNA ( 17428 , 17432 ) effectively depleted the CCR7 expression at protein and RNA levels in MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines compared with cells transfected with negative control shRNA plasmid ( Fig . 3 ) . Sequence 17432 transfected cells were selected to test the role of CCL21 / CCR7 in EMT process . When cell lines were treated with 100 ng / mL of CCL21 for 48 h , cell lines 17432 - MCF - 7 and 17432 - MDA - MB - 231 appeared almost no change in the expression of E - cadherin , N - cadherin , Vimentin and Slug compared with the CCL21 untreated cells . Furthermore , comparing the CCR7 shRNA cell lines and negative control shRNA cells , both untreated with CCL21 , CCR7 shRNA cell lines 17432 - MCF - 7 and 17432 - MDA - MB - 231 maintained the same strong expression of E - cadherin as negative control shRNA cells , whereas exhibited weaker expression of N - cadherin , Vimentin and Slug than the negative control shRNA cells ( Fig . 4 ) . This detection implies that the CCL21 / CCR7 axis play an important role in EMT process of human breast cancer cells . Modulation of CCR7 inﬂuenced the migration capacity of human breast cancer cells We further tested the inﬂuence of CCL21 / CCR7 axis on cancer cell migration behavior using wound - healing assay . When the cell lines were cultured with or without 100 ng / mL of CCL21 for 48 h , a greater number of 1428 , MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells treated by CCL21 migrated to the wound areas in comparison with the cell lines untreated by CCL21 . Whereas when CCR7 was knocked down by shRNA , a fewer number of CCR7 shRNA cells 17432 - MCF - 7 and 17432 - MDA - MB - 231 migrated to the wound areas in comparison with negative control shRNA cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Modulation of CCR7 inﬂuenced the invasive capacity of human breast cancer cells The inﬂuence of CCL21 / CCR7 axis on invasiveness of human breast cancer cells was also tested using matrigel invasion assay . After pretreated with 100 ng / mL of CCL21 for 48 h , the number of invasive cells increased remarkably in 1428 , MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines compared with that of without CCL21 pretreated . Whereas when CCR7 was knocked down by shRNA , the number of CCR7 shRNA cells 17432 - MCF - 7 and 17432 - MDA - MB - 231 moving through the matrigel decreased remarkably in comparison with negative control shRNA cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Discussion Chemotaxis and EMT are both important behaviors in carcinoma metastasis . Chemotaxis is capable of guiding cells possessing certain chemokine receptor to migrate toward the tissue that release associated chemokine [ 4 , 5 ] , while EMT enable epithelial cells to acquire invasion and migration capacities [ 12 , 13 ] . CCR7 are commonly expressed in many different cancers and closely related to lymph node metastasis , such as breast cancer [ 18 – 20 ] , nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ 21 ] , esophageal cancer [ 22 ] , gastric cancer [ 23 ] , colorectal cancer [ 24 ] , and head and neck cancer [ 25 , 26 ] . And EMT markers are also expressed in many tumors and associated with tumor invasion and dissemination [ 13 ] .

In present study , we ﬁrst examined the expressions of CCR7 and EMT markers N - cadherin and Slug by immuno - histochemical staining in 60 cases of human primary breast carcinoma tissues . Results showed that expressions of CCR7 , N - cadherin and Slug in cancer cells were signiﬁcantly asso - ciated with lymph node metastasis and clinical pathological stage , respectively ( see Table 1 ) , which were consistent with published data [ 19 , 20 , 27 , 28 ] . Moreover , we ﬁrst analyzed correlation between CCR7 and EMT marker expressions and found that CCR7 expression was closely correlated with the N - cadherin and Slug expressions ( see Table 2 ) . Based on this Fig . 3 Depletion of CCR7 expression by shRNA in human breast cancer cells . MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells were transfected with CCR7 shRNAs ( 17432 and 17428 ) and negative control shRNA ( NC - shRNAs ) ; control : without shRNA cancer cells . Knocking down of CCR7 by shRNA for 48 h , data of Western blot ( a ) and real - time PCR ( b ) showed that CCR7 was abolished at both levels of protein and mRNA . CCR7 mRNA expression was quantiﬁed using GAPDH as a normalization control .

When cultured with or without 100 ng / mL of CCL21 for 48 h , data of western blot showed that both MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells transfected with CCR7 shRNA were not in response to CCL2 stimulation , nearly no change in the level of CCR7 , E - cadherin , Vimentin , N - cadherin and Slug expression Med Oncol ( 2014 ) 31 : 180 Page 7 of 10 180 123 ﬁnding , wefurtherexploredwhetherCCL21 / CCR7axiscould stimulate breast cancer cells to acquire EMT phenotype dur - ing cell invasion and migration in vitro . Research revealed that CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 were produced by not only lymphatic endothelium but also cancer cells and stromal cells in carcinoma tissue and peri - cancerous tissue [ 29 – 31 ] , which form a transcellular gradient under ﬂow conditions to actively promote cancer cells metas - tasis and tropism by themselves [ 31 ] . Therefore , carcinoma microenvironment is abundant with CCL19 and CCL21 . A report revealed that CCR7 could up - regulate MMP9 [ 32 ] , which is also considered as a marker of EMT [ 12 ] ; therefore , CCR7 seems to be involved in the progress of EMT . In vitro , we employed human breast cancer cell lines 1428 , MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 to explore whether CCL21 / CCR7 axis could stimulate breast cancer cells to acquire EMT phenotype , including the expressions of E - cadherin , Slug , Vimentin and N - cadherin . E - cadherin is an adhesion molecule that maintains cell polarity in epi - thelial cells and epithelium - derived cancer cells . Loss of E - cadherin is the key procedure toward the invasive phe - notype in EMT [ 33 ] . Slug is a zinc - ﬁnger transcriptional repressor , belonging to Snail family member . Similar to transcription factors of Snail family , Slug binds to the E - cadherin promoter region to repress transcription of E - cadherin during development [ 34 ] . N - Cadherin and Vimentin are both mesenchymal - related proteins [ 33 , 35 ] . Our study showed that 1428 , MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines all expressed CCR7 at different levels . Treating with CCL21 , the human breast cancer cell lines appeared ﬁbroblast morphology , higher expression of CCR7 , and stronger invasive and migratory abilities comparing with the control cell lines . Interestingly , the EMT biomarkers mentioned above were also accelerated simultaneously in Fig . 5 Assay for the effect of CCL21 / CCR7 on migratory behavior of human breast cancer cells . Cell lines cultured with or without ( as control ) 100 ng / mL of CCL21 were subjected to wound - healing assay for 48 h . The number of migrated cells treated with CCL21 increased signiﬁcantly in both MDA - MB - 231 ( a ) and NC - shRNA - MDA - MB - 231 ( b ) groups , while were not signiﬁcantly increased in CCR7 - shRNA - MDA - MB - 231 group ( c ) , in comparison with without CCL21 - treated group ( data of 1428 and MCF - 7 were not shown here ) . Photographs of culture cells were taken under a phase - contrast microscope at 9 200 magniﬁcation . Scale bars 500 l m . Column : mean ; bar : SD ; * * p \ 0 . 01 based on the Student’s t test 180 Page 8 of 10 Med Oncol ( 2014 ) 31 : 180 123 both dose and time - dependent manner in cancer cell lines stimulated with CCL21 ( dose - dependent data were not shown ) . For instance , E - cadherin was down - regulated , while the Slug , Vimentin and N - cadherin were up - regu - lated . Furthermore , knocking down CCR7 of breast cancer cell lines by shRNA method , all reactions above for CCL21 stimulating in cancer cell lines were signiﬁcantly abol - ished . For example , no EMT biomarker expressions changed in CCL21 - treated CCR7 shRNA cell lines 17432 - MCF - 7 and 17432 - MDA - MB - 231 compared with the without CCL21 - treated group . Noteworthily , compar - ing the cell lines untreated with CCL21 , although CCR7 shRNA cell lines maintained the same strong expression of E - cadherin as negative control shRNA cells , whereas exhibited weak expression of N - cadherin , Vimentin and Slug than the negative control shRNA cells . This implies that CCR7 participated in regulating EMT process of human breast cancer cells . In conclusion , all data above revealed that CCL21 / CCR7 axis could stimulate cancer cells to acquire EMT phenotype . SDF - 1 / CXCR4 has been reported to link to EMT of cancer cell [ 14 – 16 ] , being consistent with our present results . Considering CCL21 / CCR7 axis commonly mediates cancer lymph node metastasis [ 11 ] , it is probably that CCR7 - expressed cancer cells acquire motility to lymph nodes through CCL21 / CCR7 initiating EMT . This is the ﬁrst report demonstrating that CCL21 / CCR7 axis could stimulate EMT process during chemotaxis of cancer cells , whereas much work need to be down in future about molecular mechanism of relationship between CCL21 / CCR7 signal pathway and EMT process .
