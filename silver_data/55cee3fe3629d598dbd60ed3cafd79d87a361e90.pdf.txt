In this study , we investigated the mechanism underlying the tumor - killing action mediated by these antibodies on an ATL model in nonobese diabetic / severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID / NOD ) wild - type mice that lack effective T and natural killer ( NK ) cells and in SCID / NOD Fc receptor common (cid:1) chain knockout ( FcR (cid:1) (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice . The ATL model was established by i . p . injection of human ATL cells ( MET - 1 ) into SCID / NOD wild - type or SCID / NOD FcR (cid:1) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 were given to the leukemia - bearing mice at a dose of 100 (cid:3) g weekly for 4 weeks . The three antibodies inhibited the leukemia growth significantly in SCID / NOD wild - type mice , as monitored by serum levels of human (cid:4) 2 - microglobulin ( P < 0 . 01 ) , and prolonged survival of the leukemia - bearing SCID / NOD wild - type mice ( P < 0 . 01 ) as compared with the control group . However , none of the antibodies manifested efficacy on the leukemia growth and survival of the SCID / NOD FcR (cid:1) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice bear - ing MET - 1 leukemia . In a pharmacokinetics study , the blood concentra - tions of the radiolabeled antibodies decreased with time similarly in SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:1) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . Although NK cells may play a role in humans , in this murine model FcR (cid:1) receptors on non - NK cells , such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes or monocytes , are required for the tumor - killing action of the antibodies directed toward CD25 . INTRODUCTION Adult T - cell leukemia ( ATL ) develops in a small proportion of human T - cell lymphotrophic virus I - infected individuals ( 1 ) . The leukemia consists of an overabundance of malignant activated T cells , which are characterized by the expression of CD25 , or interleukin ( IL ) - 2R (cid:1) , on their cell surfaces ( 2 – 4 ) . There presently is no accepted curative therapy for ATL , and patients progress to death with a median survival duration of 9 months for those with acute ATL and 24 months for those with chronic ATL ( 1 ) . The observation that IL - 2R (cid:1) is not expressed by normal resting cells , but is expressed by ATL and some other malignant cells , provided the rationale for the use of monoclonal antibodies directed toward IL - 2R (cid:1) ( 5 ) . A preclinical in vivo murine model of ATL was developed by introducing leukemic cells ( MET - 1 ) from an ATL patient into nonobese diabetic / severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID / NOD ) mice that lack effective T and natural killer ( NK ) cells ( 6 ) , and new therapeutic approaches have been tested in this model before initiating clinical trials ( 6 – 11 ) . In initial studies , antibodies to IL - 2R (cid:1) , including humanized anti - Tac ( HAT ) , murine anti - Tac ( MAT ) , and 7G7 / B6 , inhibited the progression of the leukemia and prolonged the survival of the leukemia - bearing mice ( 6 ) . Furthermore , some partial and rare complete remissions were obtained in patients with ATL treated in clinical trails with HAT , MAT , and these intact antibodies armed with 90 Y used in an effort to develop yet more effective IL - 2R (cid:1) - directed agents ( 12 , 13 ) . However , the mechanism underlying the tumor - killing action mediated by the unmodified an - tibodies directed toward CD25 remains unclear . Several mechanisms theoretically could be involved in the action of anti - IL - 2R (cid:1) in the MET - 1 ATL model . These include the blockade of IL - 2 interaction with its growth factor receptor IL - 2R (cid:1) with consequent cytokine deprivation mediated cell death , complement - dependent cytotoxicity , and antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity . Because there were no IL - 2 mRNA expression and IL - 2 production by the MET - 1 leukemic cells ( 6 ) and because 7G7 / B6 did not block the IL - 2 binding site on the IL - 2R (cid:1) ( 14 ) , the prevailing view of a sole mechanism for anti - IL - 2R (cid:1) action that is the blockade of the interaction of IL - 2 with its receptor was not supported . We also have presented evidence that excluded complement - dependent cytotoxicity ( 6 ) . Classical antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells that may be important in immunologically intact humans also does not appear to be a likely mode of action in this model because the SCID / NOD mice used as the recipients of the ATL in our study virtually lacked functional NK cells . Nevertheless , we showed that the F ( ab (cid:1) ) 2 frag - ment of HAT in contrast to intact antibody was not effective in this model ( 6 ) . Because the F ( ab (cid:1) ) 2 fragment of HAT lacks the Fc segment that is required for complement - dependent cytotoxicity and other Fc - mediated cytotoxicity , we considered the possibility that Fc - dependent antibody - mediated cytotoxicity involving FcR (cid:2) I - or FcR (cid:2) III - expressing cells , such as monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes , was a potential mechanism of action of these anti - CD25 antibodies in this model and , by inference , that FcR (cid:2) III - mediated killing might play a role in the therapeutic efficacy observed in the IL - 2 - independent phase of ATL patients . To address this hypothesis , we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 in our ATL model in SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD Fc receptor common (cid:2) chain knockout ( FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice . We showed that the three antibodies evaluated in this study had therapeutic efficacy on the MET - 1 leukemia in SCID / NOD wild - type mice , whereas this efficacy was lost in SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , indicating that the expression of the Fc receptors FcR (cid:2) I and FcR (cid:2) III that involve the Fc (cid:2) chain is required for the effective action of the antibodies directed toward CD25 in vivo . MATERIALS AND METHODS Monoclonal Antibodies . The HAT antibody ( daclizumab ) was obtained from Hoffmann - La Roche ( Nutley , NJ ) . MAT was produced as described previously ( 2 , 15 ) by fusion of NS - 1 mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells of mice that had been immunized with a cell line derived from a patient with ATL . Large quantities of the antibody were produced by inoculation of hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of BALB / c mice and then purifying the mouse IgG2a anti - Tac from the resulting ascites using DEAE cellulose chromatography . HAT and MAT recognize IL - 2R (cid:1) . 7G7 / B6 is a mouse IgG2a directed toward an epitope of the IL - 2R (cid:1) peptide other than that identified by anti - Tac ( 14 ) . The 7G7 / B6 was purified from supernatants of a hybridoma ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) using ImmunoPure Pro - tein A columns ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .

SCID / NOD mice were purchased from The Jack - son Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) , and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice were generated in the laboratory of Jeffrey Ravetch ( Rockefeller University , New York , NY ) . The ATL cell population , MET - 1 , was established from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute ATL , and the leukemic cells were maintained by serial transfer in SCID / NOD mice . MET - 1 cells have a distinct phenotype elucidated by fluorescence - activated cell sorter analysis : CD3 dim , CD4 positive / negative , CD7 , CD20 negative , and CD25 positive . The ATL model was established by i . p . injection of 1 . 5 (cid:3) 10 7 MET - 1 cells into SCID / NOD wild - type or SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice as described previously ( 6 , 8 ) . The therapy experiment was performed on the ATL - bearing mice when their serum - soluble IL - 2R (cid:1) ( sIL - 2R (cid:1) ) levels were (cid:4) 1000 pg / ml , which occurs (cid:5) 10 – 14 days after tumor inoculation . All of the animal experiments were performed in accordance with NIH Animal Care and Use Committee guide - lines . Therapy Study . Therapeutic studies were performed in MET - 1 leukemia - bearing SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . The leukemia - bearing mice were randomly assigned to groups that had comparable levels of the surrogate tumor marker , sIL - 2R (cid:1) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Groups of 15 mice were injected i . v . with 100 (cid:3) g of HAT , MAT , or 7G7 / B6 or with 200 (cid:3) l of PBS weekly for 4 weeks . An additional group received 100 (cid:3) g of HAT and 100 (cid:3) g of 7G7 / B6 weekly for 4 weeks . Throughout the experiment , tumor progression was monitored by serum levels of soluble (cid:4) 2 - microglobulin ( (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) ) , a surrogate tumor marker , and by Kaplan - Meier analysis of the survival of the mice . Monitoring of Tumor Growth . Measurements of the serum concentra - tions of the sIL - 2R (cid:1) and / or soluble human (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) were performed using ELISA . (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) , which was used as a surrogate tumor marker , was measured after therapy to monitor the growth of the leukemia . The ELISA kits were purchased from R & D System ( soluble Tac , catalogue no . DR2A00 ; soluble (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) , catalogue no . DBM200 ; Minneapolis , MN ) . The ELISAs were performed as indicated in the manufacturer’s kit inserts . Radiolabeling and Radioimmunoreactivity of Antibodies . HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 were labeled with 125 I at specific activities of 74 – 111 kBq / (cid:3) g by using the chloramine - T method . Kit225IG3 , a leukemic T - cell line that ex - presses CD25 on the cell surface , was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum , 100 units / ml penicillin , and 100 (cid:3) g / ml streptomycin in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . Immunoreactivity of 125 I - HAT and 125 I - 7G7 / B6 was evaluated as described previously ( 16 ) . Briefly , 125 I - HAT or 125 I - 7G7 / B6 ( 5 ng / 100 (cid:3) l ) was incubated with an in - creasing number of Kit225IG3 cells ( 1 (cid:3) 10 4 – 1 (cid:3) 10 7 ) with or without unlabeled HAT or 7G7 ( 25 (cid:3) g / tube ) inhibition at 4°C for 1 h . After centrif - ugation , the supernatant was aspirated , and the radioactivity bound to the cells was counted in a gamma counter . Pharmacokinetics of HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 . To define the clearance rate of infused antibodies from the blood in SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , 100 (cid:3) g ( the same dose as that used in the therapeutic study ) of 125 I - labeled HAT , MAT , or 7G7 were injected into SCID / NOD wild - type or SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( n (cid:6) 5 ) . Serial blood samples were taken at different time points after injection and counted in a gamma counter . To determine the area under the curve ( AUC ) , the percentage of the injected dose per gram of blood ( % ID / g ) was calculated and integrated using the trapezoidal rule method ( GraphPad Prism version 4p ; GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA . ) . Statistical Analysis . The serum levels of (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) at different time points for the different treatment groups and AUCs of each antibody between SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice groups were analyzed using the Student’s t test for unpaired data . Statistical significance of differences in survival of the mice in different treatment groups was determined by the log - rank test using StatView program ( Abacus Concepts Inc . , Berkeley , CA ) . RESULTS Therapeutic Study with HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 . The thera - peutic efficacy of HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 for the management of ATL was shown in MET - 1 - bearing SCID / NOD wild - type mice but not in MET - 1 - bearing SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . In the therapeutic study , the HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 monoclonal antibodies , all of which are directed toward the IL - 2R (cid:1) on the leukemic cells , were injected i . v . weekly for 4 weeks at a dose of 100 (cid:3) g in 200 (cid:3) l . All of the antibodies manifested therapeutic efficacy in SCID / NOD wild - type mice bearing MET - 1 leukemia as shown by their effects on the serum levels of (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) , a surrogate tumor marker that was indicative of the tumor load of ATL in the murine model ( Fig . 1 B ) , and by the survival of the mice ( Fig . 2 A ) . When compared with the serum concentration of (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) in the control group on days 14 and 25 after therapy , there was a significant reduction of the (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) levels in the HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 treatment groups ( P (cid:7) 0 . 0001 ; Fig . 1 B ) . Furthermore , there was a significant prolongation of survival of the mice in all of the antibody treatment groups when compared with that in the control group ( P (cid:7) 0 . 01 ; Fig . 2 A ) . The mean survival duration of the control group was 27 days , whereas it was extended to 49 days in the HAT group , 47 days in the MAT group , and (cid:4) 64 days in the 7G7 / B6 group ( Fig . 2 A ) . All of the mice in the control group had died by day 31 after therapy , whereas 14 of 15 of the HAT - treated and all of the MAT - and 7G7 / B6 - treated mice were alive at that time . In Fig . 1 .

However , the therapeutic efficacy was lost in SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . 5826 Fc RECEPTORS REQUIRED FOR ANTI - CD25 ANTITUMOR EFFICACY Research . on April 14 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from contrast , all of the antibodies used administered at the same dosing schedule as that in MET - 1 - bearing SCID / NOD wild - type mice did not show any therapeutic efficacy in SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice that were bearing the same quantity of MET - 1 leukemic cells ( Fig . 1 A ) as seen by the demonstration that there were no differences in the serum levels of the surrogate marker , (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) ( Fig . 1 C ) , and no difference in the survival of the leukemia - bearing mice ( Fig . 2 B ) when compared with the control group . Combination Therapy with HAT and 7G7 / B6 . HAT and 7G7 / B6 recognize CD25 but define different epitopes on the molecule ( 14 ) . The two antibodies bound to CD25 - positive Kit225IG3 cells specifically , and they are not cross - competing ( Fig . 3 ) . The combina - tion of these two antibodies for the management of ATL theoretically could manifest additive or synergistic efficacy . However , in this study , administration of 100 (cid:3) g of HAT and 100 (cid:3) g of 7G7 / B6 weekly for 4 weeks did not show more benefit than that of 100 (cid:3) g of 7G7 / B6 alone for the treatment of MET - 1 - bearing SCID / NOD wild - type mice as seen by the observation that there were no differences in the serum levels of (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) ( Fig . 1 B ) and no difference in the survival of the mice between the 7G7 / B6 and combination therapy groups ( Fig . 2 A ) . Pharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies . To determine whether there was any contribution provided by different concentra - tions of the antibodies in the blood to the different therapeutic effi - cacies observed with SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , we performed a pharmacokinetics experiment with 125 I - labeled HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 in SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . The blood clearance rates for each of the three antibodies evaluated in this study were similar in SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( Fig . 4 ) . The AUCs of the various 125 I - radiolabeled antibodies administered at a dose of 100 (cid:3) g were 2120 versus 1997 % IDh / g for 125 I - HAT , 1598 versus 1651 % IDh / g for 125 I - MAT , and 1085 versus 1227 % IDh / g for 125 I - 7G7 / B6 , respectively , for SCID / NOD wild - type versus SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . There was no difference in AUC for each antibody between SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( Fig . 4 ; P (cid:4) 0 . 1 ) . These results excluded the possibility of an exceptionally short survival of the monoclonal antibodies in SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice as the explanation for the failure to eliminate the tumor . DISCUSSION Thirty years after their discovery , monoclonal antibodies have become the most rapidly expanding class of pharmaceuticals for the management of a variety of human diseases ( 17 – 19 ) . A major factor in the recent advances in the use of monoclonal antibodies directed toward cancer cells is the definition of meaningful antigenic targets . In the present study , we targeted CD25 ( IL - 2R (cid:1) ) with HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 monoclonal antibodies . The scientific basis for this strategy is that IL - 2R (cid:1) is not expressed by the majority of normal resting cells of the body but is expressed by malignant cells in select patients with ATL , cutaneous T - cell lymphoma , hairy cell B - cell leukemia , and Hodgkin’s disease ( 5 ) . In a clinical trial , 6 of 19 patients with ATL treated with the unmodified MAT developed a partial or complete remission lasting from 1 month to (cid:4) 11 years ( 13 ) . In our laboratory , a preclinical in vivo murine model of ATL ( MET - 1 ) was developed to Fig . 3 . Immunoreactivities of 125 I - HAT and 125 I - 7G7 / B6 .

Treatment with HAT , MAT , 7G7 / B6 , and the combination of HAT and 7G7 / B6 prolonged the survival of the MET - 1 leukemia - bearing SCID / NOD wild - type mice significantly ( P (cid:7) 0 . 01 ) . However , the therapeutic efficacy was lost in MET - 1 leukemia - bearing SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . 5827 Fc RECEPTORS REQUIRED FOR ANTI - CD25 ANTITUMOR EFFICACY Research . on April 14 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from test new therapeutic agents and to define their mode of action before initiating patient trials ( 6 – 11 ) . In initial studies , antibodies to IL - 2R (cid:1) , including HAT , MAT , and 7G7 / B6 , inhibited the progression of leukemia and prolonged the survival of the mice ( 6 ) . The present study was designed to define the mode of action of the anti - CD25 monoclonal antibodies in this model . Several mechanisms theoreti - cally could be involved in the action of anti - IL - 2R (cid:1) in the MET - 1 ATL model . These include blockade of the interaction of IL - 2 with its growth factor receptor IL - 2R (cid:1) with the consequent cytokine depriva - tion - mediated cell death . This may be a major mode of action in patients with ATL because the majority of such patients responding to unmodified anti - CD25 antibodies manifest an autocrine IL - 2 / IL - 2R (cid:1) self - stimulatory loop . However , this mechanism does not provide an adequate explanation for the response of patients who are no longer in the IL - 2 - dependent phase of their leukemia and whose malignant cells no longer express IL - 2 mRNA . Furthermore , cytokine deprivation does not represent an explanation for the efficacy in the MET - 1 ATL model because the MET - 1 leukemic cells do not express IL - 2 mRNA and do not respond to murine IL - 2 ( 6 ) . The therapeutically effective 7G7 / B6 monoclonal antibody also does not bind to the IL - 2 binding site of IL - 2R (cid:1) and thus does not block IL - 2 interaction with its receptor ( 14 ) . Although antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity me - diated by NK cells may dominate in humans , such classical antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells also does not appear to be the mode of action of the monoclonal antibodies in this model because the SCID / NOD mice used in our study lack T and functional NK cells . Nevertheless , the antibodies appear to act through an FcR - dependent antibody - mediated mechanism . That is , although the three antibodies used showed significant inhibition of the MET - 1 ATL growth in SCID / NOD wild - type mice , they showed no efficacy on the leukemia growth or animal survival in the ATL - bearing SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . The lack of efficacy in the ATL - bearing SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice indicates that the expression of the receptor FcR (cid:2) III that requires the FcR (cid:2) chain probably is required for effective action of these antibodies directed toward CD25 in this in vivo model of ATL . This efficacy may represent a form of antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity requiring FcR (cid:2) receptors that are expressed on other cells , such as polymorphonuclear leuko - cytes and monocytes . Alternatively , the multimerization of the anti - bodies presented by the FcR on such cells may lead to aggregation of IL - 2R (cid:1) with consequent IL - 2R (cid:1) - mediated apoptotic cell death . In this regard , it should be noted that activation - induced cell death , a form of T - cell lymphocyte suicide , has as a required element the interaction of IL - 2 with its private IL - 2R (cid:1) receptor , the target of the CD25 - directed antibodies used in this study . IL - 2R (cid:1) - deficient mice do not manifest activation - induced cell death ( 20 ) . FcR (cid:2) III has been shown to be required for the action of an array of monoclonal antibodies in murine models of malignancy , including melanoma treated with antimelanoma monoclonal antibodies ( 21 , 22 ) , HER - 2 / neu - expressing breast tumors treated with trastuzumab ( 22 ) , CD20 - expressing B - cell lymphomas treated with rituximab ( 22 ) , CD2 - expressing T - cell malignancy , MET - 1 treated with the anti - CD2 monoclonal antibody MEDI - 507 ( 10 ) , and CD52 - expressing MET - 1 leukemia treated with the anti - CD52 monoclonal antibody Campath - 1 ( 11 ) . However , the anti - CD30 monoclonal antibody Hefi - 1 was ef - fective in the karpas299 model of anaplastic large - cell lymphoma in SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , suggesting in this case a direct apoptotic - inducing action of the anti - CD30 monoclonal antibody . 5 The demon - stration that Fc receptors presumably on granulocytes and monocytes is required for the action of the anti - CD25 antibodies examined in this study suggests that for their effective action there must be a proximity of FcR - expressing mononuclear cells to the leukemic cells , a require - ment that may not be accomplished in patients with lymphomas , including ATL lymphoma . An effort has been made to obtain synergistic improvement in the therapeutic efficacy in the MET - 1 ATL murine model by combining two effective therapeutic agents ( 7 – 9 ) . However , the simultaneous addition of two distinct monoclonal antibodies that require FcR (cid:2) expression yielded no additive effect . In particular , we saw no mean - ingful increased efficacy by the simultaneous administration of two distinct antibodies to CD25 in the present study or one to CD25 and a second to CD2 ( 10 ) or one to CD25 and a second to CD52 ( 11 ) in our previous trials . This suggests that the simultaneous administration of two antibodies that share a mode of action requiring FcR (cid:2) expres - sion on effector cells does not increase the efficacy beyond that provided by saturating concentrations of a single monoclonal anti - body . This observation contrasts with the synergistic efficacy ob - served when HAT was used in this model in concert with radioim - 5 Unpublished observations . Fig . 4 .

The blood clearance rates for each of the three radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies in SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice were similar . There was no difference in AUC for each antibody between SCID / NOD wild - type and SCID / NOD FcR (cid:2) (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( P (cid:4) 0 . 1 ) . 5828 Fc RECEPTORS REQUIRED FOR ANTI - CD25 ANTITUMOR EFFICACY Research . on April 14 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from munotherapy or chemotherapeutic agents that have a distinct mode of action ( 7 ) . This observation parallels those with trastuzumab and rituximab that provide additive or synergistic effects when combined with appropriate chemotherapeutic agents that have a markedly dif - ferent mode of action from those of the monoclonal antibodies ( 23 , 24 ) . In conclusion , FcR (cid:2) receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes are required for the cytocidal action of the three antibodies used that were directed toward CD25 in the MET - 1 model of ATL . HAT is already in clinical trial for the treatment of patients with ATL or with other T - cell malignancies . The results of the present study and those previously performed with this model support the use of a combination regimen in a clinical trial involving patients with ATL using HAT in concert with effective chemotherapeutic agents or with other therapeutic approaches that have a different mode of action , such as radioimmunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies armed with radionuclides .
