Introduction The membranous organelles of eukaryotic cells have unique lipid compositions that greatly influence their function ( Andersen and Koeppe , 2007 ; Phillips et al . , 2009 ; Alexander et al . , 2011 ; Iwamoto and Oiki , 2013 ) . Component lipids not only provide the physical barrier role of the membrane , but also interact with membrane proteins to control their localization and activity . A variety of integral membrane proteins are known to be acutely sensitive to their lipid surroundings , and many periph - eral membrane proteins rely on specific phospholipid headgroup interactions for membrane association . Moreover , the phospho - lipid composition of each leaflet of a membrane bilayer can be strikingly different , providing two distinct surfaces for pro - tein interactions . The cytosolic leaflet of the plasma mem - brane , for example , is enriched in phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , whereas these phospholipids are nearly absent in the extracellular leaflet ( van Meer et al . , 2008 ; Leventis and Grinstein , 2010 ) . This asymmetric mem - brane organization is produced by the action of type IV P - type ATPases ( P4 - ATPases ) , which flip PS and PE across the mem - brane to the cytosolic leaflet ( van Meer et al . , 2008 ; Leventis and Grinstein , 2010 ) . The P4 - ATPases responsible for generating membrane asymmetry also have crucial functions in vesicular transport pathways emanating from Golgi and endosomal membranes ( Sebastian et al . , 2012 ) . The precise role P4 - ATPases play in vesicle formation is unclear , although it is thought that the uni - directional transport of phospholipid from the luminal leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet bends the membrane , which contributes to the membrane curvature needed to bud small - diameter vesicles or tubular carriers . It is also possible that enrichment of specific phospholipid molecules in the cytosolic leaflet controls the localization and / or function of vesicle budding machinery re - cruited from the cytosol ( Graham , 2004 ) . The best characterized V esicle - mediated protein transport between or - ganelles of the secretory and endocytic path - ways is strongly influenced by the composition and organization of membrane lipids . In budding yeast , protein transport between the trans - Golgi net - work ( TGN ) and early endosome ( EE ) requires Drs2 , a phospholipid translocase in the type IV P - type ATPase family . However , downstream effectors of Drs2 and specific phospholipid substrate requirements for pro - tein transport in this pathway are unknown . Here , we show that the Arf GTPase - activating protein ( ArfGAP ) Gcs1 is a Drs2 effector that requires a variant of the ArfGAP lipid packing sensor ( + ALPS ) motif for local - ization to TGN / EE membranes . Drs2 increases mem - brane curvature and anionic phospholipid composition of the cytosolic leaflet , both of which are sensed by the + ALPS motif . Using mutant forms of Drs2 and the re - lated protein Dnf1 , which alter their ability to recog - nize phosphatidylserine , we show that translocation of this substrate to the cytosolic leaflet is essential for + ALPS binding and vesicular transport between the EE and the TGN . Phosphatidylserine flipping enhances membrane curvature and negative charge required for vesicular transport Peng Xu , 1 Ryan D . Baldridge , 1 Richard J . Chi , 2 Christopher G .

T H E J O U R N A L O F C E L L B I O L O G Y JCB • VOLUME 202 • NUMBER 6 • 2013 876 tested if Drs2 influenced the peripheral membrane association of Gcs1 with the EE and TGN . Indeed , Gcs1 - GFP was sig - nificantly dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of drs2  cells , and the punctae that remained did not colocalize with Tlg1 or Sec7 ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . As previously reported , the com - pact , punctate morphology of the EE was also perturbed and Tlg1 localized to enlarged structures or the vacuole ( Fig . S1 ; Furuta et al . , 2007 ) . Similar to drs2  , the snx4  mutant also has a strong defect in Snc1 recycling from the EE to the TGN ( Hettema et al . , 2003 ) . No vesicle coat protein is known to act in the Snc1 recycling pathway , and Snx4 , with its PX - BAR domain , could be another potential driver of membrane curva - ture in this pathway . But unlike drs2  , Gcs1 localized normally to the TGN / EE in the snx4  strain , and TGN / EE morphology was not perturbed ( Fig . 1 A ) . To test whether localization of Gcs1 is influenced by its ALPS motif , we examined the localization of a Gcs1 L246D mu - tant , in which a conserved leucine within the ALPS motif was sub - stituted for an aspartic acid to disrupt the amphipathic motif ( Fig . 1 C ) . Mutation of the analogous leucine in the ArfGAP1 ALPS motif abrogates interaction with curved membranes ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ; Mesmin et al . , 2007 ) . In wild - type cells , Gcs1 - GFP resided on TGN / EE membranes as it colocalized with mCherry - Tlg1 . In contrast , Gcs1 - GFP harboring the L246D point muta - tion was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm . In addition , the C - terminal half of Gcs1 ( Gcs1 186 – 352 ) containing the ALPS motif was sufficient to target GFP to TGN / EE membranes ( Fig . 1 C ) . The membranes decorated with Gcs1 - GFP were highly dynamic organelles that rapidly extended small diameter tubular protru - sions ( Fig . 1 D ) . Thus , Gcs1 binds highly curved membranes in vivo in a Drs2 - and ALPS - dependent manner . To assess the influence of Drs2 on membrane dynamics , we acquired time - lapse movies of GFP - Tlg1 with high spatial and temporal resolution in wild - type and drs2  cells ( Fig . 1 E and Videos 1 and 2 ) . Again , the wild - type cells displayed com - pact TGN / EEs that extended small - diameter tubules that rapidly fragmented and disappeared . In contrast , the drs2  membranes marked with GFP - Tlg1 were significantly larger membrane networks that were less active in forming tubules than wild - type TGN / EEs ( Fig . 1 E ) . Tubules could be observed extending from these drs2  membranes ( Fig . 1 E , arrowheads ) , although these tubules typically had a larger diameter and were slow to frag - ment . By electron microscopy , the endosomes in Drs2 - deficient cells are substantially enlarged tubular or cup - shaped structures with 200 – 250 - nm diameters ( Furuta et al . , 2007 ) , whereas the EE in wild - type cells is a tubular - vesicular membrane with di - ameters closer to 100 nm ( Mulholland et al . , 1999 ; Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 2002 ) . Many yeast organelles have highly curved membranes and yet Gcs1 is recruited preferentially to TGN / EE membranes , implying the presence of additional localization determinants in Gcs1 . Therefore , we mapped the minimal sequence required for membrane association and found that residues 186 – 285 in Gcs1 were sufficient ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . In addition to the ALPS motif ( residues 223 – 270 ) , the sequence from 186 to 216 was also critical for TGN / EE localization . The Drs2 requirement suggested that anionic phospholipids contributed to membrane P4 - ATPases for their functions in establishing membrane asym - metry and vesicular transport are Drs2 and Dnf1 from budding yeast . Drs2 localizes to the TGN , where it flips PS and PE from the luminal leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet ( Natarajan et al . , 2004 ) . Drs2 flippase activity , along with Arf - GTP , is also required to bud transport vesicles coated with clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP - 1 ( adaptor protein 1 ) from the TGN ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . Drs2 is incorporated into these AP - 1 vesicles and delivered to an early endosome ( EE ) , where its flippase activity is required to form retrograde vesicles that deliver Drs2 and an exocytic SNARE , Snc1 , back to the TGN ( Hua et al . , 2002 ; Furuta et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2008 ) . Dnf1 localizes to the TGN , EEs , and plasma membrane ( Hua et al . , 2002 ; Takagi et al . , 2012 ) , and preferentially flips phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and PE ( Pomorski et al . , 2003 ; Baldridge and Graham , 2012 ; Hachiro et al . , 2013 ) . Although Dnf1 contributes to vesicular transport pathways exiting the Golgi , Dnf1 cannot replace Drs2 function in forming AP - 1 / clathrin - coated vesicles or the Snc1 retrograde vesicles ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . Whether the strict requirement for Drs2 in the AP - 1 and Snc1 pathways is caused by a unique sub - strate , localization , or set of protein interactions is unknown . In addition , downstream effectors of Drs2 flippase activity have not been identified . Here , we show that the Arf GTPase - activating protein ( ArfGAP ) Gcs1 is a downstream effector of Drs2 PS flippase activity at TGN / EE . Gcs1 contains an amphipathic ,  - helical ArfGAP lipid packing sensor ( ALPS ) motif that is an exquisite sensor of membrane curvature , although the function of this ALPS motif in vivo has not been characterized ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ) . We find that this ALPS motif is necessary but not suffi - cient for recruitment of Gcs1 from the cytosol to TGN / EE membranes . However , a slightly larger Gcs1 fragment contain - ing a critical basic residue along with the ALPS motif was suffi - cient for membrane association . This new variant of the ALPS motif , which we refer to as a + ALPS , senses both membrane curvature and negative charge imparted to the cytosolic leaflet by Drs2 flippase activity . We have recently mapped residues that define substrate specificity of Drs2 and Dnf1 . A point muta - tion in Dnf1 that allows it to recognize and flip PS ( Dnf1 - N550S ; Baldridge and Graham , 2013 ; Baldridge et al . , 2013 ) also allows Dnf1 to replace the function of Drs2 in recruiting Gcs1 to TGN / EE membranes . Remarkably , Dnf1 - N550S effectively replaces the function of Drs2 in protein transport between the TGN and EE , demonstrating a crucial role for PS translocation in these trafficking pathways . Results Gcs1 endosomal localization is dependent on the + ALPS motif and Drs2 Gcs1 is an ArfGAP in budding yeast that localizes to cyto - plasmic punctae , which colocalize with the TGN / EE marker mCherry - Tlg1 and the TGN marker Sec7 - DsRed ( Fig . 1 , A and B ; Robinson et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , Gcs1 and Drs2 have been functionally linked through genetic interaction stud - ies and both contribute to protein transport from EEs to the TGN ( Hua et al . , 2002 ; Sakane et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , we 877 ArfGAP effector of Drs2 • Xu et al . a cho1  strain , deficient for PS synthase , displayed a primar - ily cytoplasmic distribution of Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP . Addition of exogenous dioleoylphosphatidylserine ( DOPS ) to cho1  reversed the defect and enhanced Gcs ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP TGN / EE association ( Fig . 2 E ) . PS is enriched in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane as shown by the localization of mRFP - Lact - C2 , a PS biosensor ( Yeung et al . , 2008 ) . mRFP - Lact - C2 also localized to cytoplasmic punctae in a small percentage of cells , which were typically decorated with GFP - Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) . However , GFP - Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) did not associate with the PS - rich and relatively flat plasma membrane surface ( Fig . 2 F ) . The ALPS motif shows a striking preference for inter - action with highly curved membrane surfaces ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ; Drin et al . , 2007 ) . To determine if the + ALPS motif retained this binding specificity , we tested binding of Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) to liposomes of 50 – 200 nm in diameter composed of Golgi - mix lipids ( 50 % dioleoylphosphatidylcholine [ DOPC ] , 19 % di - oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine [ DOPE ] , 5 % DOPS , 10 % liver phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , and 16 % cholesterol ; Bigay et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 3 A ) . The preferential binding to 50 - nm liposome indi - cates that the + ALPS motif retains the same curvature - sensing recruitment of Gcs1 and so we targeted two basic amino acids in the region 186 – 216 . Indeed , the K210Q mutation , within a small motif well conserved in mammalian ArfGAPs ( Fig . 2 A ) , markedly perturbed membrane association of Gcs1 ( 186 – 285 ) - GFP , whereas the R199Q mutation had no effect ( Fig . 2 C ) . We refer to this new ALPS variant as a + ALPS motif to high - light the importance of a positively charged residue upstream of ALPS for membrane association . Osh4 contains an ALPS motif and localizes to the TGN ( Drin et al . , 2007 ) . However , dele - tion of Drs2 has no influence on Osh4 membrane association , implying a specific relationship between Drs2 and the + ALPS motif in Gcs1 ( Fig . 2 D ) . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) is enriched on endosomes and plays an important role in recruiting several pe - ripheral membrane proteins ( Burd and Emr , 1998 ) . Disruption of VPS34 , encoding the sole phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase in yeast , caused enlargement of the endosomes but did not sub - stantially perturb Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP membrane association ( Fig . 2 E ) . Neither did disruption of FAB1 , the PI3P 5 - kinase , indicating that endosome targeting of Gcs1 did not require PI3P or phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI3 , 5P 2 ) .

JCB • VOLUME 202 • NUMBER 6 • 2013 878 Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP in strains harboring either a wild - type copy of DRS2 or a temperature - sensitive drs2 ts allele . At 27°C , Drs2 ts is functional and Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP localized normally to the TGN / EE with Tlg1 . However , after shifting drs2 ts cells to 38°C for 1 h , which inactivates flippase activity ( Natarajan et al . , 2004 ) , Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP membrane association was lost and the endosome became enlarged . In contrast , Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP localized normally to TGN / EE membranes in an iso - genic DRS2 strain that was shifted to 38°C ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . We also monitored Gcs1 - GFP localization in real time after shifting drs2 ts or DRS2 cells to 37°C , and found that Gcs1 - GFP dissociated from membranes as drs2 ts cells warmed from room temperature ( at 0 min ) to  37°C over a 45 - min period ( Fig . 4 C ) . A GFP - tagged form of Drs2 ts is stable after temperature shift and so the loss of Gcs1 membrane association upon Drs2 inac - tivation is unlikely to be caused by disrupting a Gcs1 – Drs2 property as the ALPS motif of ArfGAP1 ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ) . We also tested the influence of electrostatic interactions on + ALPS motif binding to membranes . + ALPS bound weakly to 200 - nm PC liposomes , but binding was enhanced in a PS dose - dependent manner , whereas the K210Q mutation blunted this effect ( Fig . 3 B ) . The + ALPS binding to 100 - nm PC liposomes was also enhanced by other anionic lipids , such as phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , PI , and PI3 , 5P 2 ( Fig . 3 C ) . PS is likely the most abun - dant anionic phospholipid in the cytosolic leaflet of TGN / EE membranes and therefore has the greatest influence on + ALPS recruitment in vivo . Drs2 flippase activity is acutely required for + ALPS recruitment To determine if Drs2 flippase activity is acutely required for membrane recruitment of the + ALPS motif , we expressed Figure 2 .

An aliquot of the cho1  cells was incubated with 1 µM DOPS / 0 . 001 % NP - 40 mixed micelles for 1 h ( cho1  + DOPS ) .

( Burd and Emr , 1998 ) or a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain from Osh1 that binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) at the TGN ( Levine and Munro , 1998 ; Fig . 5 C ) . The Gcs1 - ALPS : : PH protein tagged to GFP colocalized nearly completely with the TGN marker Sec7 - DsRed , whereas Gcs1 - ALPS : : FYVE partially overlapped with mCherry - Tlg1 ( Fig . S3 ) . Neither Gcs1 - ALPS : : FYVE nor Gcs1 - ALPS : : PH could bypass drs2  and restore GFP - Snc1 plasma membrane localization . Together , these data indicate that the Drs2 - and ALPS - dependent recruitment of Gcs1 is functionally important for EE - to - TGN protein transport , but additional effectors of Drs2 must exist to explain the role of Drs2 in this pathway . PS translocation is required for + ALPS membrane association Thus far , our data imply an important role for PS translocation by Drs2 in Gcs1 membranes recruitment . To test this , we used a Drs2 mutation in the first transmembrane segment ( Drs2 [ QQ → GA ] ) that specifically perturbs recognition of PS with no mea - surable effect on PE recognition ( Baldridge and Graham , 2013 ) . drs2  displayed cytoplasmic Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP localization and enlarged endosome morphology , and these mutant pheno - types were complemented efficiently by a plasmid expressing wild - type Drs2 . In contrast , these mutant phenotypes were not corrected by the Drs2 [ QQ → GA ] mutant or empty vector con - trol ( Fig . 6 A ) . An extra copy of wild - type Dnf1 that flips PE and PC could not support recruitment of Gcs1 ( 186 – 352 ) - GFP to physical association . Consistently , we failed to detect the pres - ence of Gcs1 in a Drs2 immunoprecipitate , whereas Cdc50 , a known binding partner for Drs2 ( Saito et al . , 2004 ) , showed a strong interaction ( Fig . S2 ) . Gcs1 is an effector of Drs2 PS flippase activity Gcs1 participates in Golgi - ER and post - Golgi vesicle transport in yeast ( Poon et al . , 2001 , 2006 ) , but also facilitates Snc1 , 2 retrieval from the EE to the Golgi ( Robinson et al . , 2006 ) . Snc1 is a SNARE that constantly cycles between the TGN , plasma membrane , EE , and back to the TGN . In wild - type cells , the rate - limiting step in this cycle is endocytosis from the plasma membrane , and so most GFP - Snc1 localizes to the plasma membrane at steady - state . In gcs1  cells expressing wild - type GCS1 , most cells showed typical Snc1 localization to the plasma membrane and only 8 % of the cells displayed GFP - Snc1 primar - ily in the cytoplasm . In contrast , 38 % of gcs1  cells ( vector ) , 23 % of gcs1 - L246D cells ( mutation in the Gcs1 + ALPS motif ) , and 30 % of gcs1 - R54K cells deficient for Gcs1 GAP activity showed GFP - Snc1 primarily localized to cytoplasmic punctae ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Thus , the ALPS motif has a measurable influ - ence on Gcs1 activity in the Snc1 recycling pathway . To determine if providing an alternative mechanism for ArfGAP recruitment to membranes could bypass the function of Drs2 in protein transport , we replaced the Gcs1 ALPS do - main with either a FYVE domain specific for PI3P binding Figure 3 .

Bars , 5 µm . 881 ArfGAP effector of Drs2 • Xu et al . translocation to the cytosolic leaflet is essential to support Chs3 trafficking in the AP - 1 pathway . Drs2 functions redundantly with Dnf1 to deliver carboxy - peptidase Y ( CPY ) from the TGN to late endosome , a pathway mediated by monomeric GGA clathrin adaptors ( Hua et al . , 2002 ) . To test the requirement for PS translocation in this path - way , we evaluated the influence of P4 - ATPase variants on CPY transport kinetics with a pulse - chase assay . The drs2  strain displayed a kinetic delay in CPY proteolytic processing ( p2 pre - cursor conversion to mature [ m ] form ) at 20°C , and Drs2 [ QQ → GA ] corrected the CPY trafficking defect as well as wild - type Drs2 , which indicates that PS flip is not necessary to support this pathway ( Fig . 7 E ) . Although an additional copy of wild - type Dnf1 partially corrected the CPY transport defect , Dnf1 N550S completely restored the CPY trafficking , indicating that PS translocation can enhance CPY trafficking even though it is not required ( Fig . 7 E ) . These results are consistent with the prior observation that CPY transport kinetics are normal in a cho1  strain ( Natarajan et al . , 2004 ) . We also examined the in - fluence of PS translocation on AP - 3 adaptor function in deliver - ing alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) from the Golgi to the vacuole , a pathway where Drs2 and Dnf1 also act redundantly ( Hua et al . , 2002 ) . For ALP , the kinetics of precursor ( pro ) to mature ( m ) form proteolytic processing were also delayed in drs2  cells at 20°C ( vector ) , but in this case each of the Drs2 and Dnf1 vari - ants could correct the delay in AP - 3 – mediated transport to the vacuole ( Fig . 7 E ) . Thus , PS translocation by a P4 - ATPase is crucial for bidirectional protein transport between the Golgi and EE , but other flippase substrates can be used to support GGA and AP - 3 trafficking routes . PS translocation is required for protein transport between the EE and the TGN We then asked if the ability of Drs2 or Dnf1 to flip PS corre - lated with the ability to restore normal protein trafficking in a drs2  strain . Introduction of wild - type Drs2 restored plasma localization of GFP - Snc1 in most drs2  cells . In contrast , Drs2 [ QQ → GA ] was only slightly better than the empty vector at correcting this defect ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . Although wild - type Dnf1 failed to suppress this drs2  defect , Dnf1 N550S restored GFP - Snc1 plasma membrane localization as well as wild - type Drs2 ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . Drs2 is required with AP - 1 and clathrin for trafficking chitin synthase III ( Chs3 ) between the TGN and EE . In an exomer mutant ( chs6  ) , Chs3 cannot be exported to the plasma membrane , and these cells are resistant to the chitin - binding compound calcofluor white ( CW ; Valdivia et al . , 2002 ) . A chs6  drs2  double knockout strain restores sensitivity to CW because the AP - 1 pathway is disrupted , allowing Chs3 to move to the PM constitutively ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . A chs6  drs2  strain expressing wild - type Drs2 was resistant to CW but Drs2 [ QQ → GA ] failed to restore CW resistance , which indicates that AP - 1 – dependent trafficking requires PS translocation ( Fig . 7 C ) . An additional copy of wild - type Dnf1 was incapable of sup - pressing the AP - 1 – dependent trafficking defect in chs6  drs2  cells . In contrast , Dnf1 N550S provided increased resistance to CW . We quantified CW binding to cell wall chitin of chs6  drs2  strains expressing the flippase variants , and P4 - ATPases capa - ble of flipping PS ( wild - type Drs2 , Dnf1 - N550S ) reduced chi - tin deposition , whereas Drs2 [ QQ → GA ] and wild - type Dnf1 were much less effective ( Fig . 7 D ) . These data indicate that PS Figure 6 . Translocation of PS to the cytosolic leaflet by a flippase is required for Gcs1 TGN / EE localization .

JCB • VOLUME 202 • NUMBER 6 • 2013 882 in Gcs1 senses both curvature and negative charge imparted to the TGN / EE membrane by P4 - ATPases with the ability to flip PS to the cytosolic leaflet ( Fig . 8 ) . Our data strongly imply that the Drs2 - and + ALPS - dependent membrane recruitment of Gcs1 is functionally significant and that Gcs1 is an effector of Drs2 PS translocase activity . This PS flippase activity is essen - tial to support vesicle - mediated protein transport between EE and the TGN , providing a strong correlation between the mem - brane - bending activity of Drs2 and vesicular transport . The PS specificity for + ALPS of Gcs1 recruitment to the TGN / EE in vivo is surprising when considering the promiscuous interaction of + ALPS with a variety of anionic phospholipids in liposome binding studies . However , dissociation of Gcs1 from TGN / EE membranes in PS - deficient cho1  cells may primarily result from loss of curvature rather than a dramatic change in anionic phospholipid composition . In these cells , Drs2 activity would be diminished by the lack of favored substrate , and the uncharged natural substrates of Dnf1 would not be as effective in recruiting the + ALPS motif . In addition , other effectors of PS in the TGN / EE cytosolic leaflet are almost certainly present , and these factors could help stabilize the Gcs1 membrane asso - ciation , enhancing the specificity of its localization . Discussion The vesicular transport machinery has a remarkable capacity for deforming biological membranes into tightly curved trans - port vesicles or tubular carriers with diameters of 50 – 100 nm ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Graham and Kozlov , 2010 ) . Although several distinct mechanisms for generating this curva - ture are possible , there is a limited set of tools available to ad - dress the contribution of each mechanism to specific transport pathways in living cells . For example , it is a matter of debate whether Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) domains induce mem - brane curvature in vivo or preferentially bind to membranes with the appropriate curvature ( Galic et al . , 2012 ) . In this regard , the ALPS motif is particularly useful because it lacks the capacity to deform membranes and is a well - defined sensor of membrane curvature ( Bigay and Antonny , 2012 ) . The ALPS motif was first described in ArfGAP1 , although no in vivo function had been reported for this motif ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ) . Here , we show that a point mutation in the Gcs1 ALPS motif that disrupts associa - tion with curved membranes also disrupts TGN / EE localization and Gcs1 function in the EE - to - TGN protein transport path - way . In addition , our data indicate that the + ALPS variant Figure 7 . Translocation of PS to the cytosolic leaflet by a flippase is required for protein transport between the EE and the TGN .

WT Drs2 , Drs2 [ QQ → GA ] , and Dnf1 N550S restored normal CPY and ALP transport kinetics , whereas WT Dnf1 partially suppressed the transport defects . pro , precursor ; m , mature . 883 ArfGAP effector of Drs2 • Xu et al . AP - 3 function , while still requiring flippase activity , is much less dependent on PS translocation . PS is also known to have an essential function in protein transport from recycling endosomes to the TGN in mammalian cells ( Uchida et al . , 2011 ) . In this case , PS concentrated on the cytosolic leaflet is important for recruiting evectin - 2 , a PS - binding protein , to the endosomal membrane . Depletion of evectin - 2 or overexpression of Lact - C2 ( to mask PS ) specifically perturbed the recycling endosome – to – TGN retrograde pathway ( Uchida et al . , 2011 ) . There is no obvious homologue to evectin - 2 in yeast , although our data indicate that PS flip is required in an analogous endosome to the TGN pathway , and perhaps other PS effectors , in addition to Gcs1 , act in this pathway . No vesicle coat protein is known to act in the EE - to - TGN transport path - way . The only other potential driver of curvature in this path - way is the PX - BAR domain of the Snx4 sorting nexin ( Hettema et al . , 2003 ) . However , Gcs1 - GFP is recruited normally to the endosome of snx4  cells even though trafficking of Snc1 - GFP is perturbed ( Hettema et al . , 2003 ) . None of the 14 human P4 - ATPases have yet been implicated in endosome - to - TGN protein transport , although mutations in the Drs2 orthologue ATP8A2 cause intellectual disability in humans and neurodegeneration The requirement of PS translocation in protein transport PS is known to stimulate the Arf - GTP – dependent assembly of AP - 1 and clathrin onto liposomes ( Zhu et al . , 1999 ) . Consis - tently , we found that PS translocation by Drs2 is required for AP - 1 / clathrin function in yeast . However , it is striking that Arf , AP - 1 , and clathrin appear to be recruited normally to the TGN of drs2  cells , even though AP - 1 / clathrin function in protein transport appears to be abolished ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . Both Arf - GTP and clathrin are thought to drive membrane curvature during vesicle budding , and yet the highly tubular Golgi cisternae and endosomes collapse into enlarged cup - shaped structures , as viewed by electron microscopy , when Drs2 is inactivated ( Chen et al . , 1999 ; Gall et al . , 2002 ; Saito et al . , 2004 ) . These observa - tions strongly argue that penetration of the Arf1 - GTP amphi - pathic helix into the TGN membrane , along with the association of AP - 1 and clathrin , is insufficient to drive curvature in the membrane in the absence of PS translocation by Drs2 . We sug - gest that the requirement of Drs2 in the AP - 1 pathway is primar - ily to induce membrane curvature that can be molded into vesicles by clathrin . There also appears to be an undefined PS - specific effector acting in the AP - 1 pathway because GGA and Figure 8 . Model for the role Drs2 PS flippase activity plays in generating membrane curvature and negative charge in the cytosolic leaflet that is sensed by the + ALPS motif of Gcs1 . PS flip is crucial for the AP - 1 – dependent trafficking of Chs3 between the TGN and EE , as well as the AP - 1 – independent transport of Snc1 from the EE to the TGN .

The protein was equili - brated to neutral buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl and 100 mM NaCl , pH 6 . 8 ) using dialysis , and the detergent was completely removed using Bio - Beads SM - 2 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Protein concentration and purity was measured by standard gel electrophoresis and comparison to BSA standards . Protein samples were immediately flash frozen before being stored at  80°C . Liposome preparation Lipids in chloroform were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . Liposomes used in flotation and binding assays were produced by the extrusion as described previously ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ) . In brief , a dried film prepared by evaporation of a mixture of the indicated lipids in chloroform was re - suspended in 20 mM Tris - HCl and 100 mM NaCl , pH 6 . 8 . After five steps of freezing in dry ice and thawing , the liposome suspension was extruded through 200 - nm or 100 - nm polycarbonate filters using a hand extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . ) at a final lipid concentration of 1 mM . For prepa - ration of 50 - nm liposomes , the liposome suspension sequentially extruded through 0 . 2 - , 0 . 1 - , and 0 . 05 - µm ( pore size ) polycarbonate filters . The lipo - some size was confirmed by negative stain EM . Liposomes were stored at room temperature and used at the same day after preparation . The composi - tion of Golgi - mix liposomes was 50 % DOPC , 19 % DOPE , 5 % DOPS , 10 % liver phosphatidylinositol , 16 % cholesterol , and 0 . 2 % NBD - PS ( mol % ) . Liposome binding assay 0 . 5 - µM proteins and 0 . 5 – 1 - µM liposomes were incubated in flotation buf - fer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , pH 6 . 8 , and 1 mM DTT ) at room tem - perature for 5 min in a total volume of 150 µl . The suspension was adjusted to 30 % sucrose by adding and mixing 100 µl of a 75 % wt / vol sucrose so - lution . The resulting high - sucrose suspension was overlaid with 200 µl of flotation buffer containing 25 % wt / vol sucrose and 50 µl of flotation buffer without any sucrose . The sample was centrifuged at 55 , 000 rpm ( 240 , 000 g ) in a swinging bucket rotor ( TLS 55 ; Beckman Coulter ) for 1 h . The top layer ( 50 µl ) was collected and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti - GST antibody ( 1 : 4 , 000 ) or Coomassie blue staining . Bands were quantified using the Odyssey Image System ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously ( Saito et al . , 2004 ) with the following modifications . Cells in 400 ml of minimal me - dium were harvested when grown to 0 . 5 OD 600 / ml at 30°C . The pel - let was washed twice with ice - cold water and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 3 M sorbitol , 0 . 1 M NaCl , and 5 mM MgCl 2 ) containing protease inhibitors ( 1 µg / ml aprotinin , 1 µg / ml leupeptin , 1 µg / ml pepstatin , 2 mM benzamidine , and 1 mM PMSF ) per 200 OD 600 . Cells were lysed by using acid - washed glass beads ( vortex 10 times ; each time , vortex 30 s and rest 30 s ) . The supernatant taken by centrifuging at 1 , 000 g for 5 min was then centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 1 h at 4°C using a rotor ( TLS55 ; Beckman Coulter ) . The pellets were taken as the total membranes . Membrane pellets were solubilized in 0 . 8 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , and 1 % CHAPS ) containing protease inhibitors . Then pel - lets were discarded after the centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 10 min at 4°C . The supernatants were separated into two equal parts : one of them was incubated with Drs2 antiserum ( 0 . 5 µl per OD 600 ) overnight . We then incubated these samples with 20 µl of protein G – Sepharose 4 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare ) for 1 h at 4°C . The protein G – Sepharose beads were then pelleted and washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer without detergents . The beads were finally heated with SDS - urea sample buffer at 65°C for 5 min . The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS - PAGE after the Western blot . Membranes were then incubated with anti - HA antibody ( 1 : 4 , 000 ) at room temperature for 1 h . After three washes with TBS with Tween 20 ( TBST ) , the membrane was incubated in anti – mouse IgG - HRP ( 1 : 2 , 000 in TBST ) for 2 h at room temperature . After three washes in TBST , membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ( PerkinElmer ) . Protein bands were detected using scientific imaging film ( Kodak ) . Pulse - chase labeling and immunoprecipitation of CPY This procedure was performed as described previously ( Graham , 2001 ) . We subcultured starting at 0 . 15 OD 600 / ml and allowed cells to grow to mid - log phase . The cells were pelleted and resuspended at 5 OD 600 / ml , then we labeled 1 - OD 600 cells with 25 µCi EXPRESS 35 S ( PerkinElmer ) at 20°C for 10 min . The chase was performed with 1 mM methionine and 0 . 1 mM cysteine for the indicated times . To stop the reaction , we added one - fourth volume of 50 % TCA . The reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min , then centrifuged at top speed for 10 min . The supernatant was in mice ( Zhu et al . , 2012 ; Onat et al . , 2013 ) . Similar pathologies are found in human patients with an AP - 1 subunit mutation or mice deficient for a GARP subunit involved in endosome - to - TGN transport ( Schmitt - John et al . , 2005 ; Tarpey et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , the Caenorhabditis elegans Drs2 orthologue Tat - 1 localizes to recycling endosomes and is required for its tubu - lar morphology and protein trafficking through this organelle ( Ruaud et al . , 2009 ; Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , PS translocation by P4 - ATPases appears to be a highly conserved mechanism for inducing membrane deformation to support vesicular transport .

CW staining Overnight cultures were subcultured to 0 . 15 OD 600 / ml and allowed to grow to mid - log phase . 1 , 000 µl of cells were pelleted , resuspended in water , repelleted , and resuspended in 100 µl of a 0 . 05 % CW solu - tion ( wt / vol ; BD ) for 10 min . The cells were washed ( pelleted and resus - pended ) twice with water and finally suspended in imaging buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , and 2 % glucose [ wt / vol ] ) . For quantification , mid - log phase cells were stained at 0 . 1 OD 600 / ml in 1 mg / ml CW in 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , for 10 min at room temperature . The cells were pelleted , washed once with water , and transferred to a 96 - well plate at a final concentration of 0 . 01 OD 600 / ml , and the fluorescence signal intensity was measured using excitation at 360 / 40 and emission at 460 / 40 with a multimode plate reader ( Synergy HT ; BioTek ) . Statistical analysis Results are expressed as the mean + SD from the specified number of ex - periments , as indicated in the figure legends .
