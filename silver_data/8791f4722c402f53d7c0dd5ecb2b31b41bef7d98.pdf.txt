Recently , we reported that centronuclear myopathy associated dynamin - 2 mutations , p . A618T and p . S619L , impair Ca 2 + - induced exocytosis of GLUT4 containing vesicles in immortalized human myoblasts . As exocytosis and endocytosis occur within rapid timescales , here we applied high - temporal resolution techniques , such as patch - clamp capacitance measurements and carbon - fiber amperometry to assess the effects of these mutations on these two cellular processes using bovine chromaffin cells as a study model . We found that the expression of any of these dynamin - 2 mutants inhibits a dynamin and F - actin dependent form of fast endocytosis triggered by single action potential stimulus , as well as inhibits a slow compensatory endocytosis induced by 500 ms square depolarization . Both dynamin - 2 mutants further reduced the exocytosis induced by 500 ms depolarizations , and the frequency of release events and the recruitment of NPY - labelled vesicles to the cell cortex after stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with DMPP . They also provoked a significant decrease in the Ca 2 + - induced formation of new actin filaments in permeabilized chromaffin cells . In summary , our results indicate that the CNM - linked p . A618T and p . S619L mutations in dynamin - 2 affect exocytosis and endocytosis , being the disruption of F - actin a possible explanation for these results . These impaired cellular processes might underlie the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations . 3 INTRODUCTION Dynamins are a family of large GTPases that form high - order homo - oligomers and play pivotal roles in various cellular processes . These proteins consist of distinct domains , including a GTPase domain , a stalk region involved in self - assembly , a bundle signaling element ( BSE ) module that connects the G - domain with the stalk and transmits conformational changes upon GTP hydrolysis , a pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) for membrane binding , and a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) ( Arriagada - Diaz et al . , 2020 ) . Their primary function involves catalyzing membrane scission during clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolae internalization , and membrane budding ( Arriagada - Diaz et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , dynamins are key regulators of cytoskeletal actin remodeling , contributing to diverse mechanical actions during cellular processes , such as bulk endocytosis , phagosome formation , neuronal growth cone dynamics , membrane protrusion , and fusion pore regulation ( Yamada et al . , 2016a ; Chuang et al . , 2019 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ; González - Jamett et al . , 2013a ; Shin et al . , 2018 ; Linadu and Álvarez de Toledo et al . , 2003 ) . Among the three dynamin isoforms expressed in mammals , dynamin - 2 stands out as the ubiquitous variant ( González - Jamett et al . , 2014 ) . Mutations in the gene encoding dynamin - 2 have been associated with two distinct neurological disorders , centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) and Charcot - Marie - Tooth neuropathy ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013b ; Ge et al . , 2016 ) . Notably , Charcot - Marie - Tooth - associated mutations predominantly affect the lipid - binding pocket within the PH domain ' s N - terminal region , impairing dynamin ' s affinity for lipids and disrupting clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( González - Jamett et al . , 2014 ; Koutsopoulos et al . , 2011 ; Sidiropoulos et al . , 2012 ) . Conversely , CNM - associated mutations cluster in the middle domain , a region critical for oligomerization , or at the interface between the stalk region and the PH domain that coordinates lipid binding and GTPase activity ( Ramachandran et al . , 2007 ; Kenniston and Lemmon , 2010 ) . These mutations often enhance dynamin - 2 self - assembly , resulting in stable oligomers and heightened basal GTPase activity ( Wang et al . , 2010 ; Chin et al . , 2015 ) . Particularly noteworthy , the p . A618T and p . S619L mutations , located in the C - terminal α - helix motif of the PH domain , enhance lipid - stimulated GTPase 4 activity and basal GTPase activity , respectively ( Kenniston and Lemmon , 2010 ) . Strikingly , these two mutations have been linked to severe neonatal forms of CNM ( Böhm et al . , 2012 ) . Dynamin - 2 ' s canonical function lies in endocytosis , a process occurring within rapid timescales , necessitating high - temporal resolution techniques for accurate assessment ( Chanaday and Kavalali , 2018 ; Montenegro et al , 2021 ) . Therefore , to investigate the impact of p . A618T and p . S619L mutations on endocytosis , we employed capacitance measurements in patch - clamped adrenal chromaffin cells . Our findings revealed that both mutants significantly diminished fast dynamin - dependent endocytosis induced by short - term depolarization stimuli and the slow compensatory endocytosis induced by 500 ms square depolarization . Moreover , these mutations impaired the exocytosis triggered by 500 ms depolarizations , and the release events and recruitment of NPY - labelled vesicles to the cell cortex induced by stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) with the agonist 1 , 1 - dimethyl - 4 - phenyl piperazine iodide ( DMPP ) . Notably , both mutations caused substantial disruptions of F - actin formation , as visualized through confocal microscopy of fluorescently - tagged G - actin . Consequently , both CNM - associated mutations adversely affected exocytosis and endocytosis , and these processes can be potentially attributed to dysregulated cytoskeletal actin filaments . These aberrant cellular processes might underlie the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations . 5 MATERIAL AND METHODS Plasmids Wild type ( WT ) dynamin - 2 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) N1 rat was kindly provided by Dr . Stephane Gasman ( CNRS , Strasbourg , France ) . The mCherry WT - dynamin - 2 was constructed by GenScript Corporation ( Nanjing , China ) by cloning the rat dynamin - 2 isoform aa ( Genbank L25605 ) into an mCherry _ pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) vector . The EGFP and mCherry dynamin - 2 mutations A618T and S619L were constructed by site - directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Neuropeptide Y fused to mCherry ( NPY - mCherry ) was kindly provided by Sebastian Barg ( Gandasi et al , 2015 , doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0127801 ) Chromaffin cell culture and transfections Bovine adrenal glands were acquired from local slaughterhouses ( Frigorífico Cocarsa - Ecocarnes S . A . , San Fernando , Provincia de Buenos Aires , Argentina , and Frigorífico Don Pedro , Quilpué , Chile ) . The isolation and culture of chromaffin cells was performed as previously published ( Guerra et al . , 2019 ) . In brief , after adrenal medulla digestion with a solution containing 0 . 25 % collagenase B , 0 . 01 % trypsin inhibitor and 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin , chromaffin cells were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation and resuspended in a 1 : 1 mixture of Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium / Nutrient Ham ' s Mixture supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . The transfection of chromaffin cells with the plasmids described above was performed by electroporation in an Amaxa Nucleofector 4D ( Lonza , Cologne , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The cells were cultured at a density of 3 × 10 5 cells / ml on 0 . 01 % poly - l - lysine treated coverslips and kept at 37°C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere . Cells were used between 2 days after transfections . Whole Cell Patch - Clamp and Membrane Capacitance Measurements These experiments were performed in an inverted microscope ( Olympus IX71 , Olympus , Japan ) , using a patch - clamp amplifier ( EPC10 double patch clamp amplifier , Heka Elektronik , Lambrecht , Germany ) . The application of the stimulation protocols and the acquisition of data were controlled by the Patchmaster® software ( Heka , Lambrecht , Germany , 6 RRID : SCR _ 000034 ) . The standard extracellular solution was composed of ( mM ) 120 NaCl , 20 Hepes , 4 MgCl 2 , 5 CaCl 2 , 5 mg / ml glucose and 1 µM tetrodotoxin ( pH 7 . 3 ) . The patch - clamp electrodes ( 3 – 5 MΩ ) were coated with dental wax , and then filled with an internal solution containing ( mM ) 95 Cs D - glutamate , 23 HEPES , 30 CsCl , 8 NaCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 Mg - ATP , 0 . 3 Li - GTP , and 0 . 5 Cs - EGTA ( pH 7 . 2 ) . The holding potential of - 80 mV was not corrected for junction potentials , and the recorded cells were discarded when the leak current measured at this holding potential was bigger than −10 pA , or when series resistance was bigger than 12 MΩ . The cell capacitance ( Cm ) was measured conti nuously during the experiments by application of the sine + dc method ( Gillis 1995 ) implemented through the lock - in extension of Patchmaster , using a sinusoidal voltage ( 800 Hz , 60 mV peak to peak ) added to the holding potential . The application of the sinusoidal voltage was suspended from 10 ms before to 10 ms after the end of the depolarizations applied to stimulate the cells . The exocytosis was induced by a single 5 ms square depolarizations from the holding potential of - 80 to - 10 mV , or by an action potential - like stimulus ( APls ) , composed by a 2 . 5 ms ascendant voltage ramp from - 80 to + 50 mV , followed by a 2 . 5 ms descendant ramp . In some cells , immediately after the application of a depolarization pulse , we noted the presence of a brief transient capacitance change , probably associated to sodium channels gating ( Horrigan & Bookman 1994 ) . This transient became negligible in less than 50 ms after the end of depolarization ( Moya - Diaz et al . 2016 ; Chow et al . 1996 ; Gong et al . 2005 ) . Therefore , to avoid any influence of this fast capacitance transient , the synchronous increase in Cm ( ΔCm exo ) associated with exocytosis was defined as the difference between the averaged Cm measured in a 50 ms window starting 60 ms after the end of the stimulus minus the average pre - stimulus Cm also measured in a 50 ms window ( see the blue segments in Supplementary Figure 1 ) . In a similar way , the following decreased in capacitance ( ΔCm endo ) , associated with endocytosis , was calculated as the difference between the averaged Cm measured in a 50 ms window starting 60 ms after the end of the stimulus minus the averaged Cm measured 5 s after the stimulus , also in a 50 ms window ( see the blue segments in Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The Cm decay associated with endocytosis was fitted in each experiment to a single exponential function with the form 7 ( ∆𝐶𝑚 = 𝑌𝑜 + 𝐴 . 𝑒 − 𝑡 𝜏𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑜 ) . The data were filtered at 3 kHz . The experiments were carried out at room temperature ( 22 – 24◦C ) . Amperometric Recordings Catecholamine release events were measured by amperometry as previously described ( González - Jamett et al . , 2017 ) using 5 μm diameter carbon fibers ( Thornel P - 55 ; Amoco Performance Product , Greenville , USA ) which were held at a potential of + 650 mV with HEKA EPC10 amplifier ( HEKA Elektronik , Lambrecht / Pfalz , Germany ) . Cells were maintained in Krebs - HEPES solution ( in mM : 140 NaCl , 5 . 9 KCl , 1 . 2 MgCl2 , 2 CaCl2 , 10 HEPES - NaOH , 10 glucose , pH 7 . 4 ) throughout the recordings , and exocytosis was induced with a 10 s of the nicotinic agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium ( DMPP ) at 50 µM by using a custom - made picospritzer using a pressure of 2 - 3 psi . Amperometric signals were low pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz with the HEKA EPC10 amplifier and the PatchMaster software ( HEKA Elektronik , Lambrecht / Pfalz , Germany ) . Each recording lasted 100 s and was analyzed using a custom - written macro for IGOR PRO ( Wavemetrics Inc . , Lake Oswego , Oregon , USA ) gratefully obtained from Dr . R . Borges ( Universidad de Tenerife , Spain ) . Analyses were restricted to spikes with amplitudes ≥ 10 pA , foot amplitudes ≥ 3 pA and foot durations ≥ 3 ms . Expression of Neuropeptide Y fused to mCherry as vesicle marker Chromaffin cells were co - transfected with the construct NPY - mCherry together with Dyn - 2 WT , or alternatively Dyn - 2 p . A618T or Dyn - 2 p . S619L . After 48 hours of transfection , cells were washed ( x3 ) with PBS buffer , where one set of cells served as an unstimulated control , while the other was stimulated with the agonist DMPP ( 50 μM , 10 s ) . Then , the cells were fixed in a PBS solution containing 4 % saccharose . After 24 h , cells were washed again with PBS and incubated for 10 min with PBS containing tris ( hydroxymethyl ) aminomethane ( 10 mM ) to deactivate PFA innate fluorescence . Finally , after a final wash ( PBS x5 ) , cells were covered with montage liquid Mowiol® and storaged at 4ºC . Confocal images were obtained with a FV300 ( OLYMPUS ) confocal microscopy , using a Plan - Apochromat 60x / 1 . 4 Oil DIC objective ( OLYMPUS ) . To visualize the green - fluorescent 8 marker EGFP , excitation was performed at 488 nm and the emission recorded at 500 - 520 nm ; and for the mCherry red - fluorescent marker , excitation was applied at 543 nm and emission was collected at 600 - 620 nm . Images were acquired in X , Y and Z axes . In the Z axis , Z - stacks were used , with stacks being separated 0 . 35  m from each other . Images were analyzed in the equatorial plane by using a custom macro on Image J software ( NIH , USA ) . The macro identified masks which accounted for the total and peripheral ( 1  m width aligned with the border ) areas , using as reference the area occupied by the fluorescence emitted for the EGPF - Dyn - 2 . Then , a second mask identified the area occupied by the fluorescence of the NPY - mCherry . Percentages of total and peripheral NPY were computed per cell as a ratio between the area associated to NPY - mCherry fluorescence and the cell´s total or peripheral area , respectively . Actin filament formation Formation of actin filaments was carried out as previously described ( Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , cultured cells were incubated in a buffer containing 139 mM k - glutamate , 20 mM PIPES , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM ATP - Mg 2 + , 20 μM digitonin , 10 μM free Ca 2 + and 0 . 3 μM Alexa Fluor 488 - G - actin conjugate , at pH 6 . 6 with . Then , cells were fixed with 4 % p - formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline ( pH 7 . 4 ) , stained with 5 mg / ml 4′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole and visualized using a Nikon C1 Plus laser - scanning confocal microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . All images were captured at the equatorial plane of the cells , using identical exposure settings between compared samples . Confocal images were analyzed and processed using a custom macro on ImageJ software ( NIH , USA ) . The macro identified masks which accounted for : 1 ) the total cell´s area , using as reference the area associated to mCherry - Dyn - 2 fluorescence , determined by Otsu’s thresholding algorithm ; and 2 ) the area occupied by Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence conjugate above a threshold determined by Renyi´s entropy based algorithm , a common standardized technique supported by ImageJ . Finally , the percentage of total F - actin formation was computed per cell as a ratio between Alexa Fluor 488 and mCherry - Dyn - 2 associated areas . 9 Statistics analysis For every experimental condition , the data ( one measurement per cell , and one cell per petry dish ) were obtained from several cell cultures , which number is mentioned in every experimental condition . No blinding was performed in this study , and no randomization procedures were applied . No test for outliers was performed . Normality was assessed with Shapiro - Wilk and D’Agostino test . Normally distributed data were analyzed by Student’s “t” test ( two - tailed ) for comparisons between two groups of independent data samples , and by one way ANOVA ( two - tailed test ) for multiple independent data samples . After ANOVA , Bonferroni test ( one - tailed ) was used for comparisons between groups . Non - normally distributed data were analyzed using the Mann - Whitney test , or the Kruskal - Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test when pertinent . All statistical analyses were performed using Prism software version ( GraphPad V5 Software Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . To fit endocytosis records we used the nonlinear curve - fitting option in Origin Pro 8 ( Microcal Software , RRID : SCR _ 002815 ) . Data are expressed as means ± SEM for normal distributions . For non - normally distributed data , box plots were used showing a centered , inferior and superior lines , representing the median , first and third quartile , respectively . Top and bottom whiskers lines show the maximum and minimum values of each distribution , respectively .

In this study , we employed bovine chromaffin cells as our research model . These cells offer unique advantages for studying exocytosis and endocytosis with high temporal resolution , through electrophysiological and electrochemical techniques . Specifically , we focused on dynamin - 2 , a crucial isoform responsible for regulating exocytosis and endocytosis ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013a ) . In the results described below we sought to shed light on the effects of CNM - associated dynamin - 2 mutations , A618T and S619L , on exocytosis and endocytosis in chromaffin cells . Previously , we demonstrated in murine chromaffin cells that the application of short stimuli , particularly a single action potential - like stimulus ( APls ) or 5 ms square depolarization , activate a fast dynamin - dependent endocytosis , while longer stimuli ( 10 to 50 ms square depolarizations ) induce a fast dynamin - independent endocytosis ( Moya - Díaz 2016 ; Montenegro 2021 ; Bayonés 2022b ) . Here , we applied APls and 5 ms square depolarization to study the effect of CNM associated dynamin - 2 mutations p . A618T and p . S619L on endocytosis in bovine chromaffin cells . As we mentioned , prior research was done in murine cells , so we first had to characterize the exocytotic and endocytotic responses elicited by the application of the same stimulation protocol , and their dependence on dynamin , in bovine chromaffin cells . Supplementary Figure 2 shows examples of Ca 2 + currents ( Fig . S2 A ) and summarizes the Ca 2 + currents amplitudes ( I Ca2 + ) and integrals (  I Ca2 + ) ( Fig . S2 B & C ) obtained in response to the application of a APls and square depolarization pulses of 5 ms ( named from now on as 5ms ) , respectively , in control conditions and in cells dialyzed with a monoclonal antibody against dynamin ( Anti - Dyn ) . In addition , Figure 1 represents typical capacitance recordings obtained in response to the application of both types of depolarizations ( Fig . 1 A ) , and a summary of the different parameters associated to exocytosis and endocytosis obtained from the same experiments ( Fig . 1 B to E ) . In control conditions , similarly to murine cells ( Bayonés et al . , 2022b ) , bovine cells did not exhibit appreciable differences in ∫I Ca2 + , exocytosis ( ΔCm exo ) , or endocytosis 12 ( ΔCm endo ) . Additionally , also resembling murine cells , there were no effects of Anti - Dyn on I Ca2 + ,  I Ca2 + , or ∆Cm exo . More important , as shown in murine cells , ∆ Cm endo and consequently endo / exo ( which represents the efficiency of endocytosis computed as the ratio between ΔCm endo and ΔCm exo ) suffered a significant reduction when APls and 5ms were applied in the presence of Anti - Dyn ( Figure 1 B , C & D ) . Lastly , as well as murine cells , the time constant of endocytosis ( τ endo ) was found to increased ( indicating deceleration of endocytosis ) in response to Anti - Dyn for APls and 5ms ( Figure 1E ) . Overall , these findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of bovine cells in terms of fast endocytosis and its dependence with dynamin , confirming their similarity to what was described before in murine chromaffin cells . Dynamin - 2 p . A618T and p . S619L mutations inhibited dynamin - dependent endocytosis , but not dynamin - independent endocytosis , in adrenal bovine chromaffin cells . Subsequently , we proceeded to examine the impact of p . A618T and p . S619L mutations on endocytosis elicited by the aforementioned stimulation protocols . Figure 2A presents examples of capacitance measurements obtained from chromaffin cells expressing , separately , EGFP - wild - type ( WT ) - dynamin - 2 or p . A618T or p . S619L , in response to the application of APls and 5ms . I Ca2 + ,  I Ca2 + ( Fig . S3 B & C ) and ∆ Cm exo ( Fig . 2 B ) were not affected by either of the mutants . Conversely , the expression of both mutants significantly decreased ∆ Cm endo and the efficiency parameter endo / exo when the cells were stimulated by APls or 5ms ( Fig 2C and D ) . Finally , the rate of endocytosis under the expression of any of both mutants increased their time constant  ( i . e . , endocytosis was decelerated ) for both type of stimuli ( Fig 2E ) . In conclusion , the effects of p . A618T or p . S619L expression were comparable to the Anti - Dyn treatment , decreasing specifically the magnitude and rate of dynamin - dependent endocytosis induced by short depolarizations . Dynamin - 2 p . A618T and p . S619L mutations inhibited massive exo and endocytosis in adrenal bovine chromaffin cells . Next , we evaluated the effects of p . A618T and p . S619L on the exocytosis and endocytosis induced by a longer stimulus , such as a 500 ms square depolarization , which forces the 13 mobilization and release of a bigger number of vesicles . Different authors found that such long depolarizations induce strong exocytosis followed by robust compensatory endocytosis or , alternatively , excess membrane retrieval ( Engisch and Nowycky , 1998 ; Smith and Neher , 1997 ) . In our hands , under the WT condition , this type of stimulation always induced a strong exocytosis followed by a slow compensatory endocytosis ( Fig . 3A ) . Notably , the expression of both mutants dramatically decreased the aforesaid parameters related with exocytosis ( ∆ Cm exo ) , endocytosis ( ∆ Cm endo ) and endocytosis efficiency ( endo / exo ) ( Fig . 3 B , C and D ) . On the other hand , I Ca2 + and  I Ca2 + evoked by this stimulus were not affected by the expression of the mutants ( Fig . S4 B , and C ) , which points towards that the observed reductions in exocytosis and endocytosis are not associated with alterations in calcium entry . The almost complete abolishment of endocytosis in cells transfected with p . A618T and p . S619L suggest that this process is associated to a dynamin - dependent mechanism , as was suggested by previous studies ( Engisch and Nowycky , 1998 ) . In addition , the huge inhibition of ∆ Cm exo observed in these conditions , together with the lack of effect of p . A618T and p . S619L on this parameter for short depolatizations , suggest that both mutants affect a process that becomes important when exocytosis exceeds a certain number of vesicles . Dynamin - 2 p . A618T and p . S619L Mutations Reduce the Secretion induced by a nicotinic agonist in adrenal bovine chromaffin cells Bovine chromaffin cells constitute a classical experimental model to study neurosecretion , a cellular process that is also influenced by dynamin - 2 ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013a ) . Therefore , to analyze the effects of the p . A618T and p . S619L on exocytosis using a different technique and a more physiological approach , we evaluated the release of catecholamine induced with the activation of nAChRs using carbon fiber amperometry . The exocytosis was evoked by a 10 s pulse of the nAChRs agonist DMPP applied to chromaffin cells expressing alternatively EGFP - WT - dynamin - 2 , or A618T , or S619L . Examples of typical recordings are represented in Figure 4A . As shown in Figure 4B , the number of DMPP - induced exocytotic events was significantly reduced by both mutations , as compared with those expressing EGFP - WT - dynamin - 2 . 14 Amperometry also allows the analysis of the dynamics of catecholamines release from individual exocytosis events ( Mosharov and Sulzer , 2005 ) . To determine whether A618T or S619L affect the characteristics of the individual exocytotic events , we further analyzed different spike parameters ( cartoon on Fig . 4 A ) , particularly the spike charge ( Q ) , that is proportional to the amount of catecholamines released during each individual event , the spike amplitude , which accounts for the height of the spike , and time elapsed at spike´s half amplitude ( HAT ) . The latter is related to the duration of the release event through an expanded fusion pore ( Fang et al . , 2008 ) . These parameters where not modified by the expression of A618T or S619L mutations when compared against WT ( Fig . 4 C ) . As the mutations did not modified Q but reduced the number of DMPP - induced exocytotic events , the cumulative Q along experimental time (  Q ) , which is a measurement of the total catecholamine release , was markedly reduced by both mutants ( Fig . 4D ) . In addition , we also analyzed the amplitude and the duration of the pre - spike foot signal ( PSF ; Fig . S5 B ) , which respectively reflect the conductance and stability of the fusion pore ( Lindau and Alvarez de Toledo , 2003 ) . The fusion pore is an unstable channel formed during the fusion process ( Marengo and Cárdenas , 2017 ) . As shown in the supplementary Figure 5 , C and D , neither A618T nor S619L mutation significantly changed these fusion pore parameters . Dynamin - 2 p . A618T and p . S619L Mutations Reduce cortical NPY labeled vesicles in adrenal bovine chromaffin cells A possible explanation for the effect of both mutations on exocytosis might be the reduction of vesicles available for fusion . It is well known that dynamin activity modulates actin dynamics ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) , and actin is involved in the transport of vesicles to plasma membrane ( Gimenez - Molina et al . , 2018 ) . In consequence , if the expression of p . A618T and p . S619L affect actin dynamics , it is possible that these mutations may disrupt the trafficking of vesicles to the plasma membrane . To assess this hypothesis , we co - expressed NPY - mCherry together with WT dynamin , or p . A618T or p . S619L , fixed the cells , and evaluated the area covered by NPY associated fluorescence by confocal microscopy ( see Materials and Methods for more details ) . It is important to mentioned that NPY is normally localized in 15 the core of secretory vesicles in physiological conditions ( Hwang et al . , 2007 ) . We performed these experiments in control rest conditions or after stimulating the cells with 50 μM de DMPP for 10 s before fixation . Figure 5 ( top ) show examples of confocal images of cells expressing WT , p . A618T or p . S619L in unstimulated ( Fig . 5A ) and stimulated conditions ( Fig . 5B ) . It is possible to observe the distribution of NPY ( red ) throughout the cytosol , and particularly in localized spots in the cell border , probably representing vesicles or vesicle clusters . Dynamin - 2 constructs ( green ) were also distributed throughout the cytosol , and for both mutants it is possible to note the accumulation of fluorescence in big spots , possibly representing mutated dynamin polymers as it was described previously ( Wang et al , 2010 ) . The bottom of Figure 5 displays the quantification of the area covered by NPY associated fluorescence in the whole cell ( % NPY Total ) and in a ring of 1 µm from the cell border ( % NPY Periphery ) , and the ratio between these two areas ( % Periphery / Total ) . The expression of both mutants did not alter any of these parameters in unstimulated cells . However , both mutants decreased very significantly the NPY in the periphery of stimulated cell . These results indicate that the expression of p . A618T or p . S619L impairs the recruitment of secretory vesicles to the cell surface after exocytosis - induced stimulus . Dynamin - 2 p . A618T and p . S619L mutations disturb F - actin dynamics . It is well known that endocytosis and exocytosis are influenced by actin dynamics ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ; Gabel et al . , 2015 ; Cárdenas et al . , 2022 ; Montenegro et al , 2021 ) , and that A618T and S619L mutations disrupt the formation of actin filaments ( F - actin ) in skeletal myoblasts ( Bayonés et al . , 2022a ) . In consequence , we decided to analyze the effect of these mutations on actin dynamics in bovine chromaffin cells . With this goal in mind , we transfected chromaffin cells with mCherry WT , or A618T or S619L dynamin - 2 . F - actin de novo polymerization was evaluated 48 h later by incubating permeabilized chromaffin cells in presence of Alexa Fluor 488 - tagged actin monomers ( see Materials and Methods for the details of the incubation solution ) . In this assay , the fluorescence signal corresponds to the recently formed actin filaments ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013a ; González - Jamett et al . , 2017 ) ; therefore , the percentage of F - actin formation was computed as a ratio between the 16 area occupied by fluorescent F - actin and cell´s total area ( see Methods for further details ) . As shown in the examples represented in Figure 6A and in the quantification of Figure 6B , both dynamin - 2 mutations significantly reduced the formation of new actin filaments . 17 DISCUSSION Dynamin - 2 was classically associated to endocytosis , however it has also been implicated in other cellular processes , like vesicle trafficking , exocytosis , and regulation of actin filament dynamics ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013b ) . Recently , by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in immortalized human myoblasts , we reported that p . A618T and p . S619L dynamin - 2 mutations impairs Ca 2 + - induced exocytosis of GLUT4 containing vesicles ( Bayonés et al , 2022a ) . These two mutations have been linked to severe neonatal forms of CNM ( Böhm et al . , 2012 ) , a form of skeletal muscle hereditary disease . However , since dynamin - 2 is ubiquitously present in a wide variety of tissues ( Cao et al , 1998 ) , it is possible that these mutations , which cause a severe neonatal phenotype , may also affect other cell types , including neuroendocrine cells and neurons . In this work we analyze if the CNM associated mutations p . A618T and p . S619L alter exocytosis and endocytosis in chromaffin cells , a classical model for the study of neurosecretion . Our study shows that both mutations inhibit specifically : ( 1 ) a form of dynamin dependent endocytosis that is activated after the application of brief single depolarizations ( Bayonés et al , 2022b ) ; ( 2 ) the exocytosis and endocytosis triggered by prolonged 500 ms depolarizations ; ( 3 ) the catecholamine release triggered by the nicotinic pathway activation ; and ( 4 ) NPY labeled vesicle recruitment to the cell cortex ; and finally ( 5 ) the de novo formation of F - actin filaments . We wondered if there is a common factor that might explain so many processes affected by these dynamin - 2 - mutants . It was described in numerous publications that alterations in actin dynamics affect both exocytosis and endocytosis in different systems ( Miklavc and Frick , 2020 ; Wu and Chan , 2022 ) . In this regard , it was shown by several authors , starting three decades ago , that interfering in actin polymerization / depolymerization dynamics affect secretory vesicles transport to plasma membrane , and consequently exocytosis ( Trifaró et al . , 2002 ; Meunier and Gutiérrez , 2016 ; Gutiérrez and Villanueva , 2018 ) . Some investigators have shown that actin filaments are also involved in the mechanism of fusion itself ( Doreian et al . , 2008 ; Berberian et al . , 2009 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , it was demonstrated that actin filaments also participate in several endocytosis mechanisms , as 18 bulk endocytosis , classical clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and ultrafast endocytosis ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013 ; Gormal et al . , 2015 ) . Particularly , we showed recently that the dynamin - dependent endocytosis induced after short depolarizations , like the one shown in the first section of this paper , is also dependent on polymerized F - actin ( Montenegro et al . 2021 ) . In the present work , we observed that p . A618T and p . S619L mutations disrupt the formation of actin filaments in chromaffin cells , and very recently we described a similar effect of both mutations in immortalized human myoblasts ( Bayonés et al , 2022a ) . It is important to note that , from the beginning , dynamin was associated with actin dynamics ( Gu et al . , 2010 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . It is therefore possible that the disruption of actin filaments formation might be responsible of the effects of these dynamin - 2 mutation on endocytosis and neurosecretion . Other dynamin - 2 mutations that cause CNM , such as the mutants R369W and R465W , or mutations linked to Charcot - Marie - Tooth neuropathy like the K562E , also lead to aberrant actin dynamics ( Yamada et al . , 2016b ; González - Jamett et al . , 2017 ; Hamasaki et al . 2022 ; Arriagada - Diaz et al . , 2023 ) . Interestingly , the R465W mutation further perturbs the synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in a mouse model of CNM ( Arriagada - Diaz et al . , 2023 ) , supporting the pleiotropic role of these mutations . Why these mutations that seem to display increased GTPase activity ( Kenniston and Lemmon , 2010 ) disrupt actin dynamics ? A possible explanation is that the enhanced self - assemble of the CNM mutations ( Kenniston and Lemmon , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) that lead to the accumulation of large oligomers in the cytosol ( James et al . , 2014 ; González - Jamett et al . , 2017 ) renders dynamin less able to interact with F - actin upon a stimulus . The augmented self - assemble of the CNM mutations can also result in the formation of abnormal clathrin - containing structures at the plasma membrane ( James et al . , 2014 ) with altered internalization ( Ali et al . , 2019 ) . The intricate functions of dynamins , particularly dynamin - 2 , and the detrimental consequences of disease - associated mutations underscore the critical role of these proteins in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis . Thus , by elucidating the impact of specific mutations on endocytosis , neurosecretion , and cytoskeletal dynamics , this work shed light 19 on the underlying mechanisms and provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of centronuclear myopathy . 20 Acknowledgments This work was supported by the grants PICT 2764 - 2016 , PICT 02849 - 2018 and PICT I - A - 00176 - 2021 ( to FDM ) from the Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica ( Argentina ) , and FONDECYT 1220825 ( to AMC ) from ANID ( Chile ) .
