However , less attention has been given to the construction of sys - tems for Japanese novelists . In this study , we built " BunCho " , an AI supported story co - creation system in Japanese . BunCho’s AI is GPT - 2 ( an unsupervised multitask language model ) trained us - ing a large - scale dataset of Japanese web texts and novels . With BunCho , users can generate titles and synopses from keywords . Furthermore , we propose an interactive story co - creation AI system as a tabletop role - playing game . According to summative studies of writers ( N = 16 ) and readers ( N = 32 ) , 69 % writers enjoyed writing synopses with BunCho more than by themselves , and at least one of fve common metrics were improved at objective evaluation , including creativity . In addition , 63 % writers indicated that BunCho broadened their stories . BunCho showed paths to assist Japanese novelists in creating high - level and creative writing .

In this sense , the Japanese novel has a long history with multiple classic novels . In this study , we are pioneers in challenging the construction of a Japanese novel using co - creation AI and designing appropriate user interfaces for end - users , specifcally for Japanese novelists . Substantial work for creative writing support has focused on the improvement of algorithmic performance , whereas few studies have investigated suitable interfaces that can increase diverse and creative writing . For example , recent AI support on creative writing [ 7 , 14 ] generated the next or entire contents or suggested an outline of a story for given topics or terms . However , these systems might limit the writer’s creation on the range of suggested contents due to the AI generation capability , the usage or capabilities of interfaces , or the user’s understanding of AI . In contrast , we propose a co - creation AI for creative novels that can assist in improving users’ written contents , induce writers’ ideas to generate more and diverse creative contents , and even in - crease the writer’s interest in creating his / her own creative writing . Specifcally , we build and improve the capabilities of AI interfaces based on interactive feedback from potential users in social net - works ( i . e . , Twitter of Japan ) , who used BunCho to create their own novel works . In this way , we propose a tabletop role - playing game ( TRPG ) as an option of co - creation to assist writers in producing more creative and diverse contents , by making the experience of novel creation similar to playing a game . We have developed BunCho ( which means literary style and “sentence bird” in Japanese ) , a writing web interface that augments the creativity of amateur novelists , with a series of AI tools . First , to make BunCho capable of Japanese language expressions , we trained BunCho’s AI by transfer learning with GPT - 2 [ 34 ] , which is one of the proven state - of - the - art language models based on unsupervised multitask learning . We used a large - scale dataset ( approximately 40 GB ) that comprises collected blog and news articles from multiple Japanese sites and Japanese Wikipedia articles . Further , to build BunCho’s AI , which can generate quality creative writing , we col - lected diverse web novels of multiple categories ( more than 110k novels ) . We also utilized crowd - sourcing by Japanese readers to remove unnecessary expressions from the synopses of collected web novels . To simplify the co - creation efort with BunCho , we assist users to easily select diverse and creative keywords for automatically generating the related novel titles or synopses , by suggesting key - words based on either templates , topics , or personal social - network contents . Note that we use the method of unsupervised key - phrase CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Osone , Lu , & Ochiai extraction [ 3 ] for selecting words . To increase writer’s interest and idea for creating more creative contents , we further propose an interactive story co - creation based on a game context by our im - plemented AI TRPG , in which the AI replies and suggests the next story content based on the writer’s input context . Our AI TRPG is inspired by AI Dungeon 1 , which is a text adventure game using AI to generate open - ended story - lines . We evaluated BunCho through user experiences , the writing ability of AI , and the capabilities of the interfaces as follows . First , in a summative user study of writers , we found that 69 % and 63 % of writers enjoyed writing with BunCho and considered that BunCho broadened their created stories , respectively . Furthermore , 69 % of writers’ synopses co - created with AI were improved in at least one of the fve common metrics , including creativity , in a summative user study of thirty - two readers ( to evaluate the writer’s works ) , compared with synopses written without BunCho . Finally , we sum - marized user experiences from common users and professional Japanese novelists and discussed the advantages , potential , and lim - itations of BunCho to assist in the development of novel co - creation AI for Japanese novelists . We make the following contributions : • We are pioneers in building a Japanese novel co - creation AI by collecting a large - scale dataset of Japanese texts and web novels and leveraging state - of - the - art language models ( GPT - 2 ) . We further revised the collected web novels’ synopses by crowdsourcing ; • We designed user interfaces for increasing the writer’s cre - ativity and interest to create his / her own creative novels . We proposed interactive story co - creation using an AI TRPG game context and simplifed co - creation with AI by sug - gesting diverse and creative keywords from a customized template , topics , and personal social - network contents ; • We demonstrated the efectiveness of BunCho by showing that more than 50 % of the writers enjoyed and considered that BunCho broadened their creative novels . In addition , writers’ synopses were improved by co - creation with AI in at least one of the fve common metrics , including creativity . We extensively discussed advantages , potential , and limita - tions in novel co - creation with AI , particularly for Japanese novelists . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Novel and Comic Creation in Japan Japan has a culture of tolerance and respect for individual artists . One of the diferences between the Japanese and American mod - els of anime - related industries is that in Japan , anime directors , manga artists or the works themselves are famous , such as Hayao Miyazaki’s " Spirited Away " , Makoto Shinkai’s " Your Name " , and Eiichiro Oda’s " One Piece " . However , in the United States , although few cartoonists are mentioned , it is often said that Disney and Pixar are famous for their studios . This is symbolized by the fact that in Japan , individuals are celebrated more [ 32 ] . Moreover , Japan has events such as Comic Market 2 and COMITIA 3 , fandom and amateur Market 96 in 2019 was announced on its ofcial site as having at - tracted a total of 730 , 000 visitors over four days 4 . Such creative culture is exported to other countries as ’Cool Japan’ . More than 130 , 000 people attend Comic - Con International 5 held in California every July , where comics and related popular art are showcased in widely known as the premiere convention for fans to celebrate . Events featuring Japanese comic culture are also held at ChinaJoy 6 in China and the Japan Expo 7 in France , where they are very popu - lar [ 10 , 36 , 38 ] . However , in Japan , there is a sense of urgency about Japan’s current creation . As critic Hiroki Azuma points out , in post - modern Japan , grand narratives like ideology have lost their appeal and have been replaced by smaller stories that seem to consume the database [ 2 ] . Originality is no longer important in this situation . The consumption of stories constructed by " moe " elements ( like character traits ) makes it impossible to distinguish between original and copy any longer [ 6 ] . Also , there is a sense of urgency regarding the current state of Japanese web fction . On web novel websites , the novels are supposed to follow a certain pattern to reach the top of the reading rankings or they will not be read . We understand that writers direct considerable efort into creating works that are evaluated on the platform . However , the websites should be the source of more diverse works . In addition , we believe there is a pure joy of creation that does not depend on ranking or being read . Thus , we believe that BunCho can help with this experience , being suitable for those who want to experience a more independent story . Furthermore , in the creation of BunCho , we thought that there was the need to combine the theme that the writers wanted to write about with the randomness and combination provided by AI . We believe that although many people are familiar with the theme they want to write about , they face difculties when beginning to write . Even if AI could generate novels on its own , it would not be interesting for writers . Therefore , our idea was a function wherein a user could insert the desired theme and the AI would provide a synopsis . There are still some improvements to be applied , such as ensuring consistency of the text and reducing the tendency to overuse certain words in the dataset ; however , we believe we have delineated a direction for the future of writing and creation using AI . 2 . 2 Co - Creation by Human - AI With the increasing capabilities of AI , the use of AI to assist hu - man users in creative activities such as writing , design , draw - ing , and dance has been studied by many researchers [ 7 , 8 , 12 – 14 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 30 , 35 ] . To efectively cooperate with AI agents , substantial work [ 7 , 11 , 13 , 28 ] has focused on how to adapt the be - haviors or generated outputs of an AI agent according to the users’ behaviors during executing a task , the feedback given by users , or the task contexts of a broad scope . However , those works focused on the adaptation of AI behaviors while there are still challenging issues in how to correctly use AI based on the understanding of users . Recent studies [ 16 , 21 , 29 ] showed that users might have difculties in co - working with AI due to non - deterministic output creators distribute creation called ’dojinshi’ in the event ; Comic 4 https : / / www . comiket . co . jp / info - a / C96 / C96AfterReport . html 1 https : / / play . aidungeon . io / 5 https : / / www . comic - con . org / 2 https : / / www . comiket . co . jp / 6 https : / / www . chinajoy . net / 3 https : / / www . comitia . co . jp / 7 https : / / www . japan - expo - paris . com / en / BunCho CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan and information overload from AI outcomes . Further , recent ad - vanced AI co - working systems required the users to be familiar with the manipulation or the context of the AI systems , or asked the users to specify the required information before the usage . This increased the efort of utilizing AI co - creation systems , particu - larly for novices or less - experienced users . Therefore , we design a novel co - creation AI system by referencing the user feedback of potential end - users during the development process . We focus on whether the devised functions or interfaces of BunCho could improve the quality of novel writing co - created with our AI , es - pecially on creativity , or could increase user’s interest to create his / her own co - created novels . We therefore provide more options ( i . e . , from templates , topics , personal data in social networks ) to select keywords for generating diverse and creative synopses . 2 . 3 Interactive User Interfaces for Human - AI Substantial works of AI - powered tools have focused on devising in - terfaces that can not only be useful for user co - creation but also be coordinated with AI’s intelligent modules , such as machine learning , for creative composition [ 15 , 17 – 19 , 28 , 40 ] such as drawing , design , and music . For example , Peng et al . [ 31 ] implemented interfaces to allow writers to interact with computers and achieve consistent goals . Goldfarb - Tarrant et al . [ 14 ] solved the shortcomings of tradi - tional human - machine interaction systems in which users were not involved in the story planning process . The model allows users to edit and change previous contents , and control the diversity of the story by adjusting the parameters . Human - computer interaction provides a good perspective for applying story generation . Fur - ther , Louie et al . [ 28 ] proposed an interface coordinated with an advanced ML model for novice music co - creation . They proposed more semantic or personalized functions for novice users such as directing the AI music generation toward semantic directions ( e . g . , happier , sadder , more conventional or surprising ) , and adjusting particular voice lanes to direct the AI generation for personal style music creation . In this study , we therefore focus on devising suit - able interfaces and usage situations with our advanced AI of novel co - creation for Japanese amateur novelists . We utilize fexible or diverse interfaces to acquire input keywords . That is , we use dif - ferent required items or input ways for diverse purposes of novel titles , synopses , phrase suggestions , or AI TRPG . Further , we devise AI TRPG to increase user’s interest for generating more creative novel contents or creating his / her own novel works , by making novel co - creating with AI as playing a game with the AI . 2 . 4 Advanced Development in Deep - Learning - based Language Models Natural language processing ( NLP ) models or related algorithms are extensively developed in multiple tasks such as question answering [ 25 ] , machine translation [ 27 ] , writing summarization [ 39 ] , or story generation [ 1 , 26 , 41 ] , In particular , language models with deep learning such as ELMo [ 33 ] ( embedding from language models ) , BERT [ 9 ] ( bidirectional encoder representation from transformer [ 37 ] ) , and OpenAI GPT - 2 [ 34 ] , are the best practices for innovative results . The success of deep learning in the NLP feld has been extended to the natural language generation ( NLG ) feld . Therefore , in this work , we aim to apply the latest NLG technology to the creativity support area . 3 BUNCHO : AI SUPPORTED STORY CO - CREATION WEB INTERFACES 3 . 1 Japanese - Writer Centered Creative and Diversifed Interfaces We build BunCho , a web site that assists Japanese writers in co - creating novels . First , we focus on reducing co - creation eforts by providing diversifed ways for generating creative titles and synopses , which is expected to be useful for novice writers . Further , we assist users in creating more and creative stories by leveraging AI TRPG that users can interactively create stories like a game context . 3 . 1 . 1 Reducing Co - Creation Eforts by Providing Diversified and Creative Keywords Inputs Methods for Generating Titles and Syn - opses . To reduce co - creation eforts , we build an interface assisting users in selecting creative or diverse keywords for generating titles and synopses generation , as shown in Fig . 1 . That is , BunCho sug - gests keywords based on the customized input methods including templates , topics , or personal social - network posts . Especially , we think that randomness and combination are important for creativ - ity . We believe that random generation of keywords could help with creative writing . Therefore , we included a random generation button such that the title keywords in the dataset can be randomly retrieved . In the interface of generating titles , the genres feld is unifed with the genre and subgenre of " Syosetsuka - ni - Narou " 8 ( which means “Let’s become a novelist” ) . The maximum number of keywords for web novel sites is usually 10 , i . e . , 10 felds for input were included . We also included a keyword template generation button to set keywords for famous works , which gives an indication of how titles can be generated . The keywords in the template were set by the authors to follow the contents of the work . Further , in the interface of generating synopses , there are 10 new felds for entering synopsis keywords . The synopsis keywords appear more easily in the synopsis if the same word is used multiple times . We included a random generation button such that the synopsis keywords in the dataset can be randomly retrieved . For users who were unable to select synopsis keywords , we also provided an option to obtain keywords from the person’s tweets via Twitter . 3 . 1 . 2 Co - Creating More Creative Stories by AI TRPG . We assist users in creating more and diverse stories by leveraging AI TRPG . TRPG , also known as a pen - and - paper role - playing game ( RPG ) , “is a form of RPG in which the participants describe their char - acters’ actions through speech . 9 ” . In AI TRPG of BunCho , users can co - create more story contents by interactive conversation as describing the main characters in the story , and the AI will suggest corresponding options of sentences with the according story back - ground setting and AI TRPG mode . The functions of AI TRPG are shown as Fig . 2 . In function ( f ) , users can set the story background with a title , a synopsis , and keywords , or can automatically set the 8 https : / / syosetu . com / 9 https : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Tabletop _ role - playing _ game CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Osone , Lu , & Ochiai Generate Diverse Keywords from Selected Templates or at Random or Social - Network Contents Keywords Input , Want to Appear in the Generated Synopsis Share Co - Created Synopses to Social - Networks Publicated Works Atmosphere - Like Keywords Input , Want to Reflect in the Generated Synopsis ( and Titles ) Figure 1 : Novel synopses and titles co - created with BunCho via the following functions . ( a ) : To simplify co - creation eforts , users can easily select diverse and creative keywords for automatically generating related novel titles or synopses , by sug - gesting keywords based on either templates , topics , or personal social - network ( Twitter ) posts . ( b ) and ( c ) : Further , users can manually or randomly select keywords , especially BunCho can process " atmosphere " - like keywords to generate the atmo - sphere of the story . ( d ) and ( e ) : Users can share their co - creations to the public or social networks or continue to co - create more stories based on a generated synopsis with AI TRPG setting . background by templates . Note that users can utilize the previously generated titles , synopses , and keywords for the background set - ting . In function ( g ) , users can adjust the number of choices and switch between a mode in which the output is conversation only and a mode in which both conversation and ground sentences are output . We explain insight by using AI TRPG for story co - creation as follows . Some of the options are illogical , but sometimes quite surprising and interesting . As the user progresses through the story , they can create a replay - style story . We prepared several scenario templates for the user to test : Alternate World Reincarnation - The villainous daughter - VRMMO ( stands for Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online role - playing game ) - Space Momotaro . There is an option for rewriting the synopsis . In this manner , the user can write in diferent scenarios . It is also possible to use " Title Generation " and " Synopsis Generation " to generate a synopsis from keywords and use it for the synopsis of the AI TRPG . 3 . 2 Unsupervised Multitask Learning on Large Amounts of Japanese Novels There has been considerable discussion regarding to Open AI’s GPT models [ 34 ] , which are modeling of Unsupervised Multitask Learn - ing and have proven to be approaching human - level ability in NLP tasks . We therefore utilize GPT - 2 as the modeling of BunCho’s AI . To build the co - creation ability of BunCho , we trained GPT - 2 with large - scale data of Japanese articles ( 40 GB ) and 110k web novels ( 110k novels ) and were continuously training the GPT models with the duration about one month ( around April - May 2020 ) by using powerful multiple GPU servers ( four NVIDIA V100 GPUs ) . 3 . 2 . 1 The Collected Large Japanese Novels and Articles revised by Crowdsourcing . For pre - training , we collated large amounts of text data from Japanese news sites and blog articles . Scrapy 10 was used for crawling and Newspaper3k 11 was used to extract the body text . We detailed the data collection and data revision by crowdsourc - ing and the preprocess of data as follows . Because unnecessary expressions were often concentrated at the end , we removed the last eight lines of every article . In addition , data from the Japanese Wikipedia were also used . After processing , approximately 40 GB of text data was collected . We also collected more than 110k web novels from the top rankings of " Syosetsuka - ni - Narou " and " Kakuy - omu " 12 . We scraped the data using beautifulsoup4 13 and linked each genre , keyword , and body text data in the database . We also utilized crowdsourcing by Japanese readers to revise the contents of unnecessary expressions ( e . g . , book publishing information or rankings in the platforms ) , which were removed from the synopses of collected web novels . 3 . 2 . 2 Unsupervised Multitask Learning with One - Month GPUs Train - ing . To obtain quality AI writing ability , we trained the GPT - 2 lan - guage model by using multiple GPUs and continued the training 10 https : / / scrapy . org / 11 https : / / newspaper . readthedocs . io / en / latest / 12 https : / / kakuyomu . jp / 13 https : / / pypi . org / project / beautifulsoup4 / BunCho CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Setting of Story Background including Genre , Title , Synopsis , and Keywords Adjustment of Generated Contents ( Story Text or Conversion Text , Number of Choices ) Selection of Editable Suggested Story Contents Figure 2 : Users can co - create more creative stories by AI TRPG via the following functions .

( h ) : Users can select AI suggested sentences into the current story . process about one - month , including pre - training on Japanese arti - cles and transfer training on Japanese web novels . To explain the writing ability of GPT - 2 model , we detailed about ( 1 ) the property of GPT - 2 language modeling and its learning . Further , we show the text data pre - processing including ( 2 ) how we processed tokeniza - tion and the selection of tokenizer and ( 3 ) the input data to GPT - 2 for generating titles , synopses , and sentences . ( 1 ) To obtain a quality GPT - 2 language model for synopsis gen - eration conditional on keywords and other factors , we utilized the property of learning language models by autoregressive factoriza - tion of the joint distribution of words . We organized the training data of learning language models such that they could generate ground truth synopses based on the information used by the model to generate synopses . Thus , a joint distribution of elements and synopsis was modeled during learning , and a synopsis was gen - erated from the conditional distribution of given elements during inference . ( 2 ) In text data pre - processing , we used SentencePiece 14 as tokenizer because SentencePiece is considered to be more suit - able for tasks such as sentence generation or translation , and it eliminates unknown words in the data and reduces the token size compared to other tokenizers . The number of tokens in Sentence - Piece was set to 50000 , and the tokenizer was trained with more than 60 GB of the collected Japanese articles and novels . ( 3 ) We used a special token to indicate the beginning of genres , keywords , a title , a synopsis , and body text and used it at a predicted time to signal the model to begin generating a title or a synopsis . The data were combined with tokens representing categories : title , keywords , title , synopsis keywords , and synopsis . Note that feature words were extracted from the collected synopses using Embedrank [ 4 ] . 4 USER STUDY We conducted a user study of within - subjects design to assess the extent to which BunCho supports user needs and to identify how this afects the user experience of co - creation with AI . Thus , we compared the experience of amateur novelists using BunCho with the experience of writing alone . We asked the following questions to writers : RQ1 : Is BunCho’s co - creation with AI more enjoyable than the traditional creative process ? RQ2 : Did you become more creative with the use of BunCho ? 4 . 1 Methodology 4 . 1 . 1 Measures . To investigate the mentioned research questions and evaluate how BunCho could improve the writing quality of the co - created synopsis , we utilized the following fve outcome metrics , which are common in writing evaluations [ 7 , 14 ] . All metrics were rated on a 7 - point Likert scale ( 1 = strongly disagree , 7 = strongly agree ) . Each reader was presented with the following questions after reading a synopsis . Creativity : Is the story of the synopsis creative ? Interestingness : Is the story of the synopsis interesting ? Comprehensibility : Did you understand the synopsis content ? Grammatical correctness : Is the synopsis grammatically correct with a smooth fow ? Consistency of sentences : Is the structure of the synopsis coher - ent and clear ? 4 . 1 . 2 Participants of Writers and Readers . We assembled 16 writers and 32 readers from Crowdworks 15 .

Writing experience is shown in Table 1 . Furthermore , to obtain objective and diverse rating results from common users , we used a considerable amount of readers ( to evaluate the written synopses ) and selected readers who are amateur writers . We paid 1 , 500 yen ( US $ 15 ) to each writer and 500 yen ( US $ 5 ) to each reader . 4 . 1 . 3 Procedure . Initially , we asked the writers to work on a syn - opsis of the science fction genre , with or without the assistance of BunCho . After completing the work , the writers were asked to self - evaluate their writing experience : whether they enjoyed writing the story by themselves or with the AI , and whether they thought they could expand the scope of the story with the AI compared to writing it by themselves .

We found that 69 % ( eleven writers ) of writer’s synopses co - created with AI might be improved compared with those synopses written by themselves , at least on one of fve writing measures including creativity . 4 . 1 . 4 Analysis . As we were interested in investigating how Bun - Cho could assist amateur writers of diferent levels or writing expe - rience , we compared the writing quality between synopses written with and without co - creation with AI , considering writers with little and good writing experiences . We conducted a paired t - test to assess whether the average values between the two groups ( co - creation with AI vs . written without co - creation ) were signifcantly diferent . We also applied the Bonferroni correction for our fve paired comparisons . 4 . 2 Assessment of Novel Co - Creation with BunCho The evaluation based on the 32 readers’ responses , in Fig . 3 , indi - cated that BunCho approached the writing ability of a writer . In particular , BunCho assisted users in providing creative or inter - esting writing , as compared with comprehensibility , grammatical correctness , or consistency of sentences . Furthermore , we evaluated the efect of BunCho on writers with diferent writing experiences or levels . Fig . 4 ( a ) and ( b ) , indicates that synopses co - created with AI were worse than synopses written by novice or low - experience writers , on comprehensibility , correct - ness , or consistency , compared with experienced writers . This might imply that a user needs certain novel - writing experience or writing ability to co - create with BunCho . Furthermore , we observed that the performance with and without BunCho on creativity ( or inter - estingness ) was similar . We might infer that BunCho could suggest creative or interesting novel contents or creative ideas for novel creation . In Fig . 5 , we detailed the efect of BunCho on each writer . Among them , we found that 11 writers’ ( 69 % ) synopses co - created with BunCho were improved in at least one of the fve writing met - rics compared with those written without BunCho . These eleven writers are W1 , W2 , W3 , W4 , W6 , W7 , W8 , W9 , W11 , W15 , and W16 . 4 . 2 . 1 Writers’ Self - Assessment . In our user study with 16 writers , 69 % enjoyed creating synopses with BunCho more than writing by themselves ; 63 % of writers considered that BunCho broadened the diversity of their co - created stories . Most users were satisfed with the usage experience of co - creating with BunCho and were inter - ested in the novel content generated by BunCho . We might infer CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Osone , Lu , & Ochiai that BunCho could bring positive or creative writing experiences in novel co - creation using AI for common novelists . 4 . 3 Writer’s Experiences about Co - Creation with BunCho 4 . 3 . 1 Creative Story Suggestion and the Assistance for Novice Writ - ers . We summarized the writer’s experiences as follows . BunCho could assist in producing creative story contents or providing ideas with interesting phrases for writers who were facing difculties . As for the positive reactions , the fact that they were able to create a story which they could not think about on their own using the AI and the freshness of the phrasing was mentioned . In addition , for those who have never written a novel before , creating a synopsis was a difcult task , but BunCho made it easier for them ( from the writers W1 , W2 , W4 – W9 , W11 , W12 , and W14 – W16 , where these detailed comments are put in Appendix ) . 4 . 3 . 2 Inconsistent Story Generation on Experienced Writers’ Cre - ation . Nevertheless , unsatisfed comments showed that some writ - ers might not be satisfed with the usage experience , AI generated contents , or inconsistent AI synopses considering their proposed keywords . Negative reactions indicated that they were still not satisfed with the results generated by the AI and that they felt more comfortable writing by themselves . Moreover , for those who had already thought about a synopsis of the story , some were not satisfed with the synopsis generated from keywords because it did not follow the expected storyline . Some also said that the user inter - face was difcult to understand ( from the writers of W2 , W3 , W5 , W6 , W8 , W10 , and W13 , where these detailed comments are put in Appendix ) . Essentially , there are still some improvements to be made to the AI generation results and user interface ; however , we have obtained a good response to using AI as an aid for beginners to start creating . 5 CONCLUSIONS We propose BunCho , a Japanese novel co - creation AI interface that can generate novel titles and synopses by typing keywords using the Japanese version GPT - 2 . BunCho assists users in co - creating creative novels in an interactive format similar to TRPG . In our user study , we compared writers on their own written synopsis with those synopsis co - created by BunCho . The results showed that users enjoyed co - creating the synopsis with BunCho more than by themselves . We believe we have delineated one direction for the future of Japanese story writing and co - creating with AI . Furthermore , we plan to evaluate the efect and user experiences of AI TRPG on BunCho’s co - creation .

The average values of means in Fig . 3 are from creativity to consistency of sentences ( µ 1 = 4 . 69 , µ 1 = 4 . 73 , p = 1 . 0000 ; µ 2 = 4 . 10 , µ 2 = 4 . 35 , p = 0 . 0819 ; µ 3 = 4 . 80 , µ 3 = 5 . 30 , p = 0 . 0000003 ; µ 4 = 5 . 00 , µ 4 = 5 . 31 , p = 0 . 0006 ; µ 5 = 5 . 08 , µ 5 = 5 . 38 , p = 0 . 0019 ) . The mean values on low - experience writers in Fig . 4 ( a ) are ( µ 1 = 4 . 66 , µ 1 = 4 . 67 , p = 1 . 0000 ; µ 2 = 4 . 03 , µ 2 = 4 . 26 , p = 0 . 2195 ; µ 3 = 4 . 76 , µ 3 = 5 . 31 , p = 0 . 0000007 ; µ 4 = 4 . 92 , µ 4 = 5 . 31 , p = 0 . 0001 ; µ 5 = 5 . 02 , µ 5 = 5 . 36 , p = 0 . 0019 ) . The mean values on high - experience writers in Fig . 4 ( b ) are ( µ 1 = 4 . 83 , µ 1 = 5 . 02 , p = 1 . 0000 ; µ 2 = 4 . 40 , µ 2 = 4 . 70 , p = 0 . 7723 ; µ 3 = 5 . 00 , µ 3 = 5 . 28 , p = 0 . 7326 ; µ 4 = 5 . 33 , µ 4 = 5 . 31 , p = 1 . 0000 ; µ 5 = 5 . 36 , µ 5 = 5 . 49 , p = 1 . 0000 ) . B WRITER’S EXPERIENCES ABOUT CO - CREATION WITH BUNCHO We showed the writer’s experiences ( relatively positive ) in Section 4 . 3 . 1 as follows . ( W1 ) : " What I wrote was a reasoning story that could predict the future , but AI was interesting because it depicted a completely unpredictable future " . ( W2 ) : " When I didn’t come up with an idea , I felt that it was easy to write a novel as I could get choices from AI " . ( W4 ) : " The synopsis generated completely diferent from the story I had in mind , and I thought it was interesting in that sense . However , even though the overall storyline was diferent from my intentions , I feel like I could have been somewhat helpful by tweaking it " . ( W5 ) : " Although it is a synopsis , when I tried to write a novel myself , I had a hard time writing an idea because I had no writing ability . I feel like I’ve settled down on the usual settings , partly because of the small number of drawers I have in my mind to expand the story . In that respect , AI generation made it easy for me to come up with ideas for development and to write sentences by giving me a start to ideas and creating sentences to some extent " . ( W6 ) : " I thought that the AI assistance wasn’t bad because the combination of keywords was more interesting than I expected . However , it’s the many generated results , so it’s important to have a sense of depression . When I thought that the correct usage was not to win the frst time , but to use it only by assisting” . ( W7 ) : " The wording was very fresh " . CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan ( W8 ) : " I was able to work unexpectedly happily " . ( W9 ) : " I had never written a novel in a situation where the theme was set in advance , so I found it a little difcult . There wasn’t much reference to AI because it was set incorrectly , but it was interesting to be able to develop the story from an unexpected direction , such as whether there was such a perspective " . ( W11 ) : " When using AI , the initial settings became more interesting than just thinking for myself . However , when I devised a story , I needed knowledge that I didn’t have " . ( W12 ) : " It was a very interesting experiment . The endless possibilities of story plots have expanded " . ( W14 ) : " It would have been easier for AI to create the opportunity , but since I had never written a novel , I had a lot of trouble with them " . ( W15 ) : " It was difcult to write a synopsis , but with AI , I knew how to write so that I could see the road that I couldn’t see , and I felt that the range of expression had expanded " . ( W16 ) : " I was able to experience ideas that I couldn’t think of " . We showed the writer’s experiences ( relatively negative ) in Sec - tion 4 . 3 . 2 as follows . ( W2 ) : " However , I think that it will be easier Osone , Lu , & Ochiai to use if you describe how to use the site and things like HOW TO " . ( W3 ) : " I couldn’t even fnd a hint because it doesn’t make sense " . ( W5 ) : “However , if I rely solely on AI , there is no doubt that I will not feel that I am writing a novel myself . I fnd it difcult to adjust how much I should rely on " . ( W6 ) : “I also thought that it would take more time to leave the creation of novels to AI . " . ( W8 ) : “However , if I use AI , the fun will be reduced " . ( W10 ) : " Even if the synopsis was generated by AI , there were some parts that did not make sense in Japanese , and it was difcult to make because the story went in a direction that was too diferent from what I had imagined . The outline of AI is not a story in the frst place depending on the keyword , but I would like a comment on how much you can edit it . In order to make a proper synopsis of 300 characters or more , I had to make it diferent from the one output by AI , but it was difcult to judge experimentally whether it was okay " . ( W13 ) : " It was quite difcult because I had never written a science fction novel myself " .
