The ability of cells to deform and actively respond to mechanical forces is critical for embryonic development and for homeostasis in adult tissues and organs . Cell mechanics is the factor that defines the cellular response to the mechanical forces exerted by the cell’s microenvironment , including neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix 1 . This cellular response can be vis - cous , elastic , or viscoelastic , as well as passive or active . The recent development of tools for measuring cell mechanics has revealed that changes in cell and nuclear mechanics are hallmarks of many human diseases , particularly metastatic cancer , cardiovascular dis - ease , inflammation , laminopathies , host – microbe interactions in infectious diseases , and frailty in aging 2 – 6 . Values of cell elasticity ( the stretchiness of cells ) and viscosity ( a measure of viscous dis - sipation ) reported in the literature vary considerably even among groups that used the same instruments . One contributor to these variations is often assumed to be differences in cell - culture condi - tions ( subtle differences in temperature , pH , cell passage number , etc . ) , which prevent direct comparisons among datasets and may have slowed down the translation of cell mechanics instruments for clinical applications . In this work , we measured and compared the mechanical prop - erties of the commonly used MCF - 7 human breast cancer cells , cul - tured in the same environmental conditions in vitro , by applying seven different technologies , including atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , magnetic twisting cytometry ( MTC ) , particle - tracking microrheology ( PTM ) , parallel - plate rheometry , cell monolayer rheology ( CMR ) , and optical stretching ( OS ) . Overall , although the underlying mechanical principles remain the same , our mea - surements highlight how cell mechanics depends on the level of mechanical stress and rate of deformation to which the cell is sub - jected , the geometry of the mechanical probe used in the experi - ments , the probe – cell contact area , the probed location in the cell ( e . g . , cell cortex , nucleus , lamella , or cytoplasm ) , and the extracel - lular context ( monolayer of cells versus single cells , adherent versus free - floating cells , etc . ) . Our results also highlight how mechanical properties of cells can vary by orders of magnitude , depending on the length scale at which cell viscoelasticity is probed , from tens of nanometers ( e . g . , the diameter of an actin fiber ) to several microm - eters ( the size of a whole cell ) . Results To ensure consistency , we obtained the measurements presented below in a total of eight different laboratories using MCF - 7 cells from the same lot , cultured in medium from the same lot , all directly pro - vided by ATCC . We measured the mechanical properties of these cells by AFM , MTC , PTM , parallel - plate rheometry , CMR , and OS . Details of the techniques used by the participating laboratories are presented in Supplementary Table 1 .

Yet reported values of cell stiffness and viscosity vary substantially , which suggests differences in how the results of different methods are obtained or analyzed by different groups . To address this issue and illustrate the complementarity of certain approaches , here we present , analyze , and critically compare measurements obtained by means of some of the most widely used methods for cell mechanics : atomic force microscopy , magnetic twisting cytometry , particle - tracking microrheology , parallel - plate rheom - etry , cell monolayer rheology , and optical stretching . These measurements highlight how elastic and viscous moduli of MCF - 7 breast cancer cells can vary 1 , 000 - fold and 100 - fold , respectively . We discuss the sources of these variations , including the level of applied mechanical stress , the rate of deformation , the geometry of the probe , the location probed in the cell , and the extracellular microenvironment .

AnAlysis NaTure MeThods their inter - relationships can be found in Supplementary Note 2 . Among the methods tested in this study , AFM , parallel - plate rhe - ometry , and OS all provide measurements of Young’s modulus ( E ) , whereas MTC , CMR , and PTM all provide measurements of the shear modulus ( G ) . Atomic force microscopy . AFM - based indentation is commonly used to quantify the mechanical properties of adherent cells at subcellular resolution ( Fig . 2a , b ) . An atomic force microscope consists of a cantilever of calibrated stiffness that applies a pre - set force or deformation at a defined speed onto an adherent cell or tissue and , through laser deflection and detection by a pho - todetector ( Fig . 2a ) , measures the corresponding resisting force from the deformation of the cell ( Fig . 2b ) . A 3D piezo scanner allows one to measure x , y , and z displacements of the cantilever relative to the underlying cell ( Fig . 2a ) . Here we indented MCF - 7 cells with nanoscale pyramidal probes ( radius of the probe apex : ~ 10 nm ) , mesoscale spheroconical probes ( radius : ~ 750 nm ) , and microscale spherical probes ( radius : ~ 5 μ m ) ( Fig . 2c ) . b c Purely elastic solid material σ σ 0 t 0 < Δ t < T / 4 T ε ε 0 σ σ 0 ε ε 0 t T σ σ 0 t Δ t = T / 4 T ε ε 0 ε ε σ 0 t ε Creep Dynamic Purely viscous fluid Viscoelasticmaterial a F ( t ) F ( t ) F 0 F F Dynamic test Stretch F L 0 l 0 l ∆ L L Compression L 0 l 0 A Shear ∆ L L 0 Creep test ε F 0 ε Time Time σ 0 σ 0 t t Fig . 1 | Description of rheological tests . a , Different geometries of deformation . To test the mechanical properties of a material , one can stretch or compress it ( left ) or apply a mechanical shear stress ( right ) . During stretching , the deformation of the material results from a pulling force F perpendicular to the surface of the sample . Similarly , compression corresponds to deformation ( shortening ) that results from a pushing force perpendicular to the surface area . In contrast , a shear test involves deformations that occur when the force is applied parallel ( tangential ) to the surface of the sample . b , Constant or oscillating applied stress . A creep test consists in the application of a constant stress ( σ = F 0 / A ) over time and recording of the resulting deformation ε ( t ) of the sample ( left ) . For a dynamic test , the applied force oscillates , thereby resulting in an oscillatory deformation of the sample ( right ) . c , Examples of material responses for a creep test and a dynamic test for a purely elastic material , a purely viscous fluid , and a viscoelastic material .

AnAlysis NaTure MeThods We measured the elastic ( effective Young’s ) modulus of the cells by fitting the curves of the measured force as a function of the verti - cal position of the cantilever using so - called elastic contact mod - els that account for the geometry of the indentation ( Methods ) . Our measurement with a nanoscale AFM probe showed that the mechanical properties of cells are heterogeneous and vary consider - ably from cell to cell ( Fig . 2d , e ) . For ~ 1 - µ m indentations produced at a speed of 2 µ m s – 1 with a sharp tip—both of which are typical values for this method—the average static effective Young’s elastic modulus of MCF - 7 cells was 5 . 5 ± 0 . 8 kPa ( mean ± s . d . ; n = 60 ) over the central nuclear region and 3 . 8 ± 0 . 5 kPa over flat regions of the cell body , between the nucleus and the cell edge . Higher indentation speeds resulted in higher elastic moduli of 10 . 5 ± 0 . 5 kPa ( Fig . 2c – e ) . When cells are indented with a larger probe ( Fig . 2f , g ) , AFM measurements are less sensitive to local cell heterogeneity , and the elastic modulus is substantially lower . Indentation of the nuclear region by probes with an intermediate apex radius ( ~ 0 . 75 μ m ) at a speed of 2 μ m s – 1 yielded an elastic modulus of 0 . 58 ± 0 . 23 kPa , computed via the ‘blunted indenter’ contact model 7 , 8 . With the Hertz model of indentation 9 , 5 - μ m - diameter glass beads attached to tipless cantilevers ( Fig . 2h , i ) and an indentation depth of ~ 300 nm yielded elastic moduli of 0 . 53 ± 0 . 52 kPa for an indentation speed of 10 µ m s – 1 at 37 °C , and 0 . 81 ± 0 . 06 kPa for 6 µ m s – 1 at room tempera - ture . Together , these results show that the mechanical properties of cells measured by AFM can differ more than tenfold , depending on the measurement parameters and the probed regions of the cells . Whole - cell deformation measurements . Once MCF - 7 cells are detached from their underlying substrates , they round up ( simi - larly to cancer cells in blood vessels after intravasation ) and can be kept alive in suspension for a few hours . To measure the viscoelastic properties of cells in suspension , one must use methods that pre - serve this suspended state , such as parallel - plate rheometry and OS . Parallel - plate rheometry . The parallel - plate rheometer extracts the Young’s ( extensional ) modulus and deformability ( i . e . , compliance ) at the global cellular scale 10 . A single cell is placed between a rigid plate and a flexible plate of calibrated stiffness k that is used as a force probe , and the cell is stretched through constant or oscillatory displacements ( Fig . 3a ) . For oscillatory displacements of plates with frequency ω ( Fig . 1 ) , the elastic ( storage ) and viscous ( loss ) moduli , E ′ ( ω ) and E ʺ ( ω ) , respectively , are weak power laws of the frequency : E ′ ( ω ) ~ E ʺ ( ω ) ~ ω α , with α < < 1 ( Fig . 3b ) . The exponent α of this power law estimates the balance between dissipative and elastic behaviors : a higher exponent signifies higher viscous dissipation ; in particular , α = 0 for a purely elastic solid ( e . g . , rubber ) , whereas α = 1 for a viscous liquid ( e . g . , water ) . For MCF - 7 cells at a frequency of 1 Hz , the viscous modulus E 0 ʺ was 340 ± 40 Pa , the elastic modulus E 0 ′ was 950 ± 150 Pa ( Fig . 3c , d ) , and α was 0 . 18 ± 0 . 01 , indicating a predominantly elastic response . The parallel - plate rheometer also measures the relaxation and creep functions of individual cells , that is , the evolution of stress under constant strain and the deformation under constant stress , respectively . MCF - 7 cells showed a weak power - law behavior with an extensional modulus = + ′′ ′ E E E 0 02 0 2 = 1 , 020 ± 150 Pa at 1 Hz ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Moreover , when we applied static cell elon - gation and measured the corresponding lateral cell deformation , we found a Poisson’s ratio ν of 0 . 33 . We estimated the shear modulus G 0 as E 0 / 2 ( 1 + ν ) = 380 Pa at 1 Hz . Optical stretching . The optical stretcher allows one to measure the creep compliance and modulus of single cells through the use of a dual - beam optical trap to induce well - defined mechanical stresses on whole cells in suspension 2 , 11 , 12 . The forces that trap and deform the cell surface ( Fig . 3e ) through the transfer of momentum from the light to the cell are due to the change in the refractive index 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 2 , 500 3 , 000 0 5 10 Elastic stretching modulus ( Pa ) at 1 Hz N u m be r o f c e ll s 0 5 10 Loss stretching modulus ( Pa ) at 1 Hz 14 0 . 14 0 . 12 0 . 10 0 . 08 0 . 06 0 . 04 0 . 02 0 . 00 121086420 – 2 0 2 4 6 8 N u m be r o f c e ll s 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 −200 −100 0 100 200 0 200 400 Elastic modulus ( Pa ) N u m be r o f c e ll s Divergent laser beams Cells Flow channel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 r ( t ) Stretching force a b c d e f g h 0 200 400 600 800 0 50 100 E 1 η 1 150 Steady - state viscosity ( Pa s – 1 ) N u m be r o f c e ll s Steady - state viscosity Elasticmodulus 10 – 2 10 – 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 M odu li ( P a ) Frequency ( Hz ) Elastic stretching modulus Loss stretching modulus d ( ω ) D ( ω ) L 0 y z y x x ∆ J ( t ) C o m p li an c e ( P a – 1 ) S t r a i n ( % ) Time ( s ) ∆ t η 2 E 1 η 1 η 2 Fig . 3 | Whole - cell deformation measurements . a – d , Cells between surfaces . a , Schematic of the parallel - plate rheometer .

AnAlysis NaTure MeThods ( RI ) at the cell – medium interface 12 . We measured the RI of MCF - 7 cells by digital holographic microscopy and found an average RI of 1 . 374 ± 0 . 002 ( mean ± s . e . m . ; n = 89 ) 13 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We computed the stress on the cells by using an electromagnetic wave model 14 . For convenient delivery of the cells into the trapping region , the optical stretcher is integrated into a microfluidic system ( Fig . 3e ) , which enables measurement rates of > 100 cells per hour . In this study , we analyzed MCF - 7 cells after each cell had been trapped for 2 s at a power of 0 . 2 W per fiber and stretched for 8 s at 0 . 75 W per fiber . We obtained an average peak strain ( at t = 8 s after onset of stretching ) of 5 . 16 % ± 0 . 11 % ( Fig . 3f ) , with average peak compliance ( i . e . , deformability ) of 0 . 053 ± 0 . 001 Pa − 1 ( Fig . 3f ) . The creep compliance profile of cells reveals their composite viscous and elastic properties . The white triangle in Fig . 3f indicates a clear linear increase in strain ( i . e . , deformation ) with time , demonstrat - ing a dominant viscous behavior when the cells were in suspension . The inverse of the slope provides a first estimation of steady - state viscosity , which we found to be about 180 Pa s – 1 . Fitting with finer models 2 yielded a viscosity of 158 ± 84 Pa s – 1 ( Fig . 3g ) . We note here that this overwhelming dominance of viscosity over elasticity is not a feature of all cell types as measured by OS 15 . Elastic moduli obtained via standard linear liquid model fitting were 18 ± 24 Pa ( Fig . 3h ) . Even with MCF - 7 cells , stretching at higher laser powers produced creep curves with more pronounced elastic components ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . Overall , whole - cell measurements of the elasticity of MCF - 7 cells by parallel - plate rheometry and OS showed ~ 50 - fold differences , with parallel plates leading to higher values . Notably , the measurements of elasticity obtained with parallel plates were in the same range as those obtained by AFM . Multicellular measurements . CMR probes cells placed between two plates of a commercial rotational rheometer with a glass sen - sor and plate – ring geometry , which provides more accurate mea - surements in the regime of large shear deformations than the conventional plate – plate geometry 16 ( Fig . 4a ) . Fibronectin coat - ing ( 2 µ g cm – 2 ) of the plates enhances cell adhesion ; cells form a sparse monolayer that can be observed through a microscope dur - ing measurements ( Fig . 4a ) . The ring rotates around its symmetry axis , which leads to simultaneous shear deformation of the cells . At an oscillation frequency of 0 . 5 Hz , MCF - 7 cells exhibit a decrease in shear modulus with increasing amplitude of the imposed shear deformation . The cell shear modulus G at a relative deformation of 0 . 1 is 4 . 6 ± 2 . 2 kPa . The cell elastic ( stretching ) modulus E was 12 ± 5 . 7 kPa , assuming a Poisson ratio of 0 . 3 .

AnAlysis NaTure MeThods and viscous contributions to the cell shear modulus from the phase shift between excitation and cell response , G ′ = 4 . 5 ± 2 . 2 kPa and G ʺ = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 5 kPa , corresponding to elastic and viscous stretching moduli Y ′ = 12 ± 5 . 7 kPa and Y ʺ = 3 . 9 ± 2 . 9 kPa , respectively ( Fig . 4 ) . At a constant relative deformation of 0 . 02 , the cell shear modulus increased with increasing oscillation frequency to fit a power law with an exponent β = 0 . 065 . Under constant load , single - cell creep compliances followed a power law in time with an exponent that decreased with increasing stress from approximately 0 . 1 to 0 . 01 ( Methods ) .

AnAlysis NaTure MeThods of MCF - 7 cells on the basis of the magnitude of the bead – cell area of contact ( Fig . 5b ) , the magnetic field applied ( Fig . 5c ) , and the displacement of the magnetic bead 14 , 15 ( Fig . 5c ) . The shear modulus of MCF - 7 cells G 0 , calculated as + ′′ ′ G G 02 0 2 , was 0 . 69 ± 0 . 05 kPa ; the elastic modulus G ′ was 0 . 62 ± 0 . 04 kPa ; and the viscous modu - lus G ʺ was 0 . 25 ± 0 . 02 kPa . Assuming a Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 3 , Young’s modulus E 0 of MCF - 7 cells was 1 . 78 ± 0 . 12 kPa , the elastic modulus E ′ was 1 . 62 ± 0 . 11 kPa , and the viscous modulus E ʺ was 0 . 66 ± 0 . 06 kPa ( Fig . 5d ) . Particle - tracking microrheology . For PTM , we ballistically injected submicrometer fluorescent beads into the cytoplasm or nucleus of cells , and then allowed the cells to recover in fresh medium over - night 17 . We measured spontaneous movements of the beads inside the cells with ~ 5 - nm spatial resolution at a video rate of 30 frames per second for 20 s 17 – 19 . We computed the mean square displace - ments ( MSDs ) of beads from the bead trajectories ( Fig . 5e – g ) . The ensemble - averaged MSDs from three different cell - culture plates were identical ( Fig . 5h ) . One - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) showed that there was no significant difference ( P = 0 . 3 ) in the elas - tic modulus from three different plates measured at 30 Hz , thus sug - gesting consistent and reproducible results ( Fig . 5i ) . At 1 Hz , the elastic modulus G ′ was 4 . 5 ± 0 . 4 Pa , and the viscous modulus G ʺ was 10 . 1 ± 0 . 9 Pa ( Fig . 5j ) . We were also able to calculate the creep com - pliance of the cytoplasm of MCF - 7 cells from the MSDs of the beads ( Fig . 5k ) . The peak incidence of creep compliance from beads was ~ 7 × 10 − 3 ( 1 / Pa ) ( Fig . 5i ) . Together , these results demonstrate that the elasticity of cells measured by MTC is > 100 - fold higher than that measured by PTM , and that MTC measurements of cell elastic - ity are in the same range as AFM measurements . Discussion Mechanical forces play a major role in the regulation of the func - tion and organization of cells , tissues , and organs . The modulus of a cell—a measure of its viscoelastic properties—is a key factor in how cells sense these forces and interact with other cells and the extracellular matrix . In this study , we measured the mechanical properties of cells by different methods , including AFM , PTM , OS , CMR , MTC , and parallel - plate rheometry . In principle , different types of rheological measurements should be related to each other if certain assumptions about the materials being measured are valid , yet the average values of moduli vary by at least two orders of magnitude ( Table 1 ) . In general , the results presented in Table 1 can be divided into three categories on the basis of the values of the obtained moduli : small ( OS and PTM ) , intermediate ( AFM with dull probes , parallel - plate rheometry , and MTC ) , and high ( AFM with a sharp probe and CMR ) . The widely distributed mechanical measurements obtained in our study indicate that the mechanical response of cells to forces is highly dependent on the force profile . These methods differ widely in how the measurements are col - lected and what area of the cell is probed ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , which explains the differences in part . These results also highlight the importance of selecting an adequate technique for the biological question being addressed ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Below we briefly discuss the main reasons for similarities and variations among dif - ferent measurements ; a more thorough discussion can be found in Supplementary Note 3 . The methods that produce intermediate modulus values ( AFM with a dull probe , MTC , and parallel - plate rheometry ) share physical similarities in terms of how measurements are collected 20 . Among the AFM measurements , measurements giving rise to smaller elas - tic moduli can be explained by the difference in the physics of the probe – cell contacts in these methods . Moduli derived from MTC data are about 60 % higher than those derived by parallel - plate rhe - ometry . The difference could be explained by the additional contact between the beads and microscopic roughness of the pericellular membrane ( microvilli and microridges ) in the MTC approach . Whereas forces are applied to the cell directly as a result of physical contact in AFM , parallel plates apply forces through molecular links developed between the plates and the cell body . In CMR , the mea - sured elastic modulus is about an order of magnitude higher than the ones obtained via other probe - based methods , and this can presum - ably be explained by the increased level of tensile pre - stress 21 . Cells in CMR can undergo high tensile forces between plates because of the fibronectin coating 10 , 22 , 23 . The positive association between pre - stress level and measured elastic modulus is also consistent with the observations of substantially higher moduli in AFM experiments with the sharp conical AFM probe compared with those obtained Table 1 | Overview of measurements technique Elastic / storage modulus ( kPa ) * Location of the measurement throughput Atomic force microscopy ( tip size , temperature , loading rate ) Conical probe , 25 °C , 6 μ m s – 1 13 . 5 ± 7 . 0 At the cell surface 1 – 20 cells per hour Conical probe , 37 °C , 2 μ m s – 1 5 . 5 ± 0 . 8 750 nm , 37 °C , 2 μ m s – 1 0 . 58 ± 0 . 23 2 , 500 nm , 25 °C , 6 μ m s – 1 1 . 31 ± 0 . 54 2 , 500 nm , 37 °C , 10 μ m s – 1 0 . 53 ± 0 . 52 Whole - cell measurements Optical stretching 0 . 018 ± 0 . 024 Whole suspended cell 60 – 300 cells per hour Parallel - plate rheology ( 1 Hz ) 0 . 95 ± 0 . 15 Whole adherent cell 6 cells per hour Cell monolayer measurements Cell monolayer rheology 4 . 5 ± 2 . 2 Monolayer of cells 5 – 6 h per monolayer Bead - based measurements Particle - tracking microrheology ( 1 Hz ) 0 . 0045 ± 0 . 0004 Intracellular 30 cells per hour Particle - tracking microrheology ( 30 Hz ) 0 . 111 ± 0 . 002 Magnetic twisting cytometry 1 . 62 ± 0 . 11 At the cell surface 2 , 000 cells per hour * Elastic moduli derived from AFM represent the effective Young’s modulus .

Such a probe produces much higher stresses compared with those observed with dull probes . As a result , the cell presumably becomes overstretched and stiff , similar to what is observed with other soft materials and viscoelastic polymer solu - tions 24 . In this study , MTC and CMR involved an ‘active’ mechani - cal measurement in which specific ligands were used . Mechanical measurements can propagate deeply into a cell through pre - stress and stiff actin bundles that guide the propagation of forces over long distances 25 . This active mechanical measurement can be achieved with AFM and the parallel - plate method 10 , 22 , 23 . The elasticity of MCF - 7 cells measured by OS was more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the elasticity measured by AFM or MTC . This difference is probably attributable to the fact that OS measures free - floating cells , whereas the other methods measure cells adhered to a rigid glass substrate . Given that it was shown that the modulus of weakly adherent MCF - 7 cells does not change substantially 26 , complete detachment of cells from the sur - face may be required to mechanically ‘relax’ cells . The location of probes relative to cells can also affect mechanical measurements , and it has been shown that cell nuclei are typically harder than the cell periphery 8 , 26 – 30 . PTM yielded the lowest elastic moduli out of all the techniques tested in this study . It is likely that this is due to the low pre - stress in PTM measurements ; also , this method can probe mechanical properties of the cytosol 31 . For further comparison of the various measurement methods , analytical models based on the physics principles of each method are used , and with these certain assumptions are introduced , such as linear elasticity for AFM or viscoelastic behavior for the other meth - ods . The second assumption underlying most mechanical measure - ments of cells is that the Poisson’s ratio is close to 0 . 5 , or at least is a constant . However , recent work indicates that the cytoplasm of living cells can behave as a poroelastic material . Thus the common assumption that the Poisson’s ratio is a constant during measure - ment is invalid , and this is likely to affect measurements that occur on different length or time scales 32 . Furthermore , Young’s and shear moduli during macroscopic measurements of biopolymer net - works such as collagen networks 33 , 34 and intact biological tissues 35 , 36 become uncoupled from each other at deformations as small as a few percent . Consequently , errors can be introduced during trans - formation of the primary data into material properties . The current study does not cover the whole spectrum of cellular mechanical measurement methods . Several new techniques have recently been developed to measure cell mechanical properties at high speed ( 10 – 10 , 000 cells per second ) , such as microfluidic - based methods 37 – 40 and the optics - based noninvasive Brillouin microscopy method 41 , 42 . These methods potentially can provide new avenues to extend cellular mechanical studies to clinically relevant samples . However , most of these techniques do not provide a direct mea - surement of the Young’s modulus of cells , which makes comparison between techniques difficult . The goal of this work was to directly compare different methods of measuring cell mechanics by probing the same type of cells with minimal biological variation , but systematic errors may arise from different instrumentation setups , which could also contribute to the observed wide spectrum of results . For example , temporal heating of the cells during cell stretching is one of the primary sources of systematic error with OS 43 . Measurements of cell elasticity with OS can lead to shortening of the time scale at which the cells respond owing to the elevated temperature from the laser . The potential sources of systematic error for PTM 44 , 45 , AFM 24 , 34 , 35 , MTC 46 , 47 , and parallel - plate measurements 48 have been discussed previously . Importantly , the reported systematic relative error is , in general , < 20 % , whereas the observed differences in measured elastic moduli with these different methods can be more than three orders of mag - nitude . The ~ 1 , 000 - fold differences in elasticity measured by AFM and PTM in the present study were in the same range as shown in a previous study in which the mechanical properties of nontumori - genic breast epithelial MCF - 10A cells and tumorigenic breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells were measured 49 . Therefore , the measurement spread between different cell mechanical assays is less likely to be due to method - dependent systematic errors , and more likely to be due to the differential mechanical responses of cells to the different force profiles produced by these different methods .

MCF - 7 cells ( American Type Cell Culture , Manassas , VA ) were cultured at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in culture medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and penicillin – streptomycin . Cell lines were passaged every 3 – 4 d according to their growing conditions . Parallel plates . Each MCF - 7 cell was subjected , successively , to three different protocols : dynamic moduli measurements , a relaxation experiment , and a creep experiment . Each measurement was separated by a lag time of 1 min ; the whole protocol lasted just 6 min to limit the evolution of cell behavior in response to mechanical solicitations . We applied stresses of about 80 Pa and strains of around 10 % in amplitude to ensure linear mechanical behavior of the cells ( when the mechanical stress induced by the applied strain increases linearly with strain amplitude ) 48 , 50 . In dynamic rheometry , single cells were deformed sinusoidally and the storage and loss moduli were retrieved as functions of the frequency f ( obtained from measurements of the ratio | δ | / | D | and the phase lag between δ ( t ) and D ( t ) for 0 . 01 Hz < f < 10 Hz , where δ ( t ) and D ( t ) are the instantaneous deflection of the flexible plate and the rigid plate displacement , respectively ) .

In relaxation experiments , cells were subjected to a constant strain ( constant D ) , and we measured δ ( t ) . The relaxation modulus = σ ∕ε E t t ( ) ( ) 0 then is Δ = ε = E t kD t S kL D t S ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 0 0 The rigid plate tip is moved over a distance Δ 0 corresponding to the desired cell elongation ( phase of strain increase ) , and a feedback loop applies a displacement D ( t ) to the base of the flexible plate to keep its tip in a fixed position ( flexible plate deflection , and thus stress , increases to elongate the cell from its initial shape to the target elongation ) . The cell response is a power law of time ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Data can be fit with the expression πα πατ α τ = − − − α α − − t A t t ( ) sin ( ) ( 1 ) [ ( ) ] 1 1 where τ is the rise time during which strain is established ( first phase of the experiment ) , and A and α are , respectively , the prefactor and exponent as defined in power law creep . In creep experiments , single cells were stretched under constant applied stress . We thus applied a constant deflection δ on the flexible plate and measured the displacement D ( t ) of the rigid plate , which was proportional to cell elongation . The cell creep function is = ε σ = J t t D t S kd L ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 0 0 Consistent with dynamical measurements in the frequency domain ( described above ) , the creep function of cells follows a power law of time ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , and data can be fit to = α J t At ( ) . The exponent α is the same as the one retrieved from dynamic measurements ( described above ) , and the prefactors A ( creep ) and = + ′′ ′ E E E ( ) ( ) 0 0 2 0 2 ( dynamic rheology ) are related by the relationship π α = Γ + α E A ( 2 ) ( 1 ) 0 where Γ is the gamma function , Γ ( n ) = ( n − 1 ) ! .

We used a microfluidic delivery system to serially trap and then stretch cells along the laser beam axis . We used a CCD ( charge - coupled device ) camera to image the elongation dynamics of the cell body caused by stretching , and then used the video to measure the time - dependent strain ( Fig . 3e ) . We normalized the time - dependent strain extracted from the video images by the applied peak stress and a geometric factor 52 to obtain the creep compliance for each cell . For each passage , the number of cells per OS experiment was n ≥ 55 . Compliance data are presented as mean ± s . e . m . Overall , the number of individual cells analyzed was 514 . Curve - fitting of the average compliance was done with the curve - fitting toolbox in Matlab ( Mathworks , Natick , MA , USA ) . To fit the compliance of individual cells , we used a custom code to implement nonlinear least - squares fitting based on the Matlab function fminsearch ( Nelder – Mead algorithm ) . Cell monolayer rheology . To characterize the rheology of MCF - 7 breast cancer cells , we used oscillatory shear to determine viscous and elastic cell moduli . Here we imposed either strain or stress and measured the other . We also performed creep measurements at constant shear stress to determine the creep compliance . We recorded the cell shear deformation while increasing or decreasing stress at a constant rate . ( 1 ) Amplitude sweep : an oscillatory excitation at a fixed frequency with stepwise increasing amplitude of either strain or stress ( Fig . 4b ) . This protocol probes the amplitude dependence of the mechanical properties of MCF - 7 cells . Here we oscillated at a frequency of 0 . 5 Hz and probed a strain γ between 0 . 001 and 0 . 1 , which corresponds to 0 . 015 – 0 . 5 μ m of displacement of the rheometer plates ( gap between plates : 15 μ m ) . First , we performed strain - controlled measurements and recorded the amount of stress that occurred in response . For stress - controlled measurements we remained within the observed bounds , which were typically a few hundred pascals per cell . This maintained the cell strain as a response to the applied stress at a reasonable magnitude , thus allowing us to avoid cell detachment or yielding . ( 2 ) Frequency sweep : the amplitude of oscillation was kept constant at a value of 0 . 02 for strain - controlled measurements , or at the corresponding stress value ( Fig . 4c ) . We increased the oscillation frequency gradually from 0 . 1 to 10 Hz . ( 3 ) Creep experiments : for applied stress , the cell strain was recorded as a func - tion of time . During measurements , each stress was kept constant for 10 s and subsequently increased stepwise . The resulting creep compliances ( resulting shear divided by applied stress ) were plotted as a function of time for a total of ten stress values . The curves were well approximated by a power law yield - ing exponents that decreased with increased stress , from approximately 0 . 1 to 0 . 01 ( Fig . 4d ) . ( 4 ) Stress ramp : the applied stress was increased at a constant rate until it reached a maximum stress , and then it was decreased at the same rate back to zero ( Fig . 4e ) . The time course of the resulting strain was recorded . We carried out this process three additional times , each time with an increased rate . Magnetic twisting cytometry . Ferromagnetic beads ( Fe 3 O 4 ; ~ 4 . 5 μ m in diameter ) were coated with Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) peptide , where 50 µ g of RGD peptide per milligram of beads was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of carbonate buffer , pH 9 . 4 , on a tube rotator that was constantly being rotated 53 , 54 . Beads were first added to the cell - culture dish and incubated for 10 min before the experiment . Beads were then magnetized with a strong magnetic impulse ( ~ 1 , 000 G , < 100 μ s ) , giving rise to the bead’s magnetic moment . A sinusoidal varying magnetic field ( 0 . 3 Hz ) perpendicular to that of the bead’s magnetic moment was then applied to rotate the bead . We used the MTC technique of measuring cell stiffness 53 – 57 to exert an oscillatory force on the cells with a peak stress of 17 . 5 Pa by varying the magnetic twisting field between 0 and 50 G . By quantifying the magnetic bead displacements , we were able to calculate the cell stiffness in units of pascals per nanometer , the bead embedded area , and the cell complex modulus 55 , 58 . The complex shear modulus ( G ) is defined as = ′ + ′′ G G iG where the real part ( G ′ ) is the storage modulus , the imaginary part ( G ʺ ) is the loss modulus , and i is the unit imaginary number − 1 . The component of the bead displacement that is in phase with the applied magnetic torque corresponds to G ′ and is a measure of stiffness . G ′ is proportional to the stored mechanical energy . The component of the bead displacement that is out of phase with the magnetic torque corresponds to G ʺ and is a measure of friction . G ʺ may be taken as the dissipated mechanical energy . Because MTC applies a rotational shear stress , the Young’s modulus is calculated with the assumption that the cell is incompressible , and it is three times the shear modulus . During twisting , the applied apparent stress ( σ ) is σ = α cH cos where π ∕ −α ( 2 ) is the angle of the bead’s magnetic moment relative to the twisting field , c is the bead constant ( in pascals per gauss ) , and H is the applied magnetic field ( in gauss ) . To calibrate the bead constant , we placed beads in a fluid of known viscosity . Throughout this study , beads with a constant of 0 . 35 Pa / G were used . The actual stress ( σ * ) depends on the contact area between the bead and the cell surface , and thus σ * = βσ , where β is determined from the bead - embedded area by finite element analysis 58 . The cell stiffness is calculated as σ ε = ∕ G * , where ε is the angular strain that equals the displacement of the bead divided by the radius of the bead .

AnAlysis NaTure MeThods Ballistic - injection nanorheology or particle - tracking microrheology . MCF - 7 cells were plated on a 35 - mm dish ( Corning ) and reached ~ 90 % confluence before ballistic injection . 100 - nm - diameter fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles ( Invitrogen ) were ballistically injected into the cells with a Biolistic PDS - 1000 / HE particle - delivery system ( Bio - Rad , Richmond , CA ) . Nanoparticles were coated on microcarriers ( Bio - Rad ) and allowed to dry for 6 h before injection . 1 , 100 - p . s . i . rupture disks ( Bio - Rad ) were used to apply pressure to accelerate nanoparticles . Cells were repeatedly washed with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution ( Gibco ) after ballistic bombardment to eliminate excess nanoparticles , thus reducing endocytosis of nanoparticles . Cells were allowed to recover in fresh growth medium overnight before embedded nanoparticles were tracked with a high - magnification objective ( 60 × / 1 . 4 - NA ( numerical aperture ) Plan Apo lens ; Nikon , Melville , NY ) . We verified that none of the probed nanoparticles underwent directed motion . An optimized region of interest was generated with NIS - Elements software . Movies of the Brownian motion of the fluorescent nanoparticles were captured at 30 frames per second for 20 s with an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EMCCD ) camera ( Andor Technology , Belfast , Ireland ) mounted on a Nikon TE2000 microscope . Particle trajectories were tracked and analyzed with customized Matlab software ( MathWorks , Natick , MA , USA ) . At least 200 different nanoparticles were tracked per condition . Three biological repeats were conducted . Cells were incubated overnight before imaging after injection . Because injected nanoparticles can uniformly disperse throughout the entire cytoplasm in cells , the differences detected represent global changes in cytoskeletal stiffness as opposed to location - specific cytoskeletal changes . The MSDs ( Δ r 2 ) of individual nanoparticles are calculated from 600 - frame ( 20 - s ) - long streams of the centroid locations of the nanoparticles 18 . The mean elasticity of the cytoplasm is calculated from the ensemble - averaged MSD through the following steps as described by Mason et al . 59 . Briefly , the ensemble - averaged MSD of the nanoparticles is related to the complex viscoelastic modulus as follows 19 : ω Δ τ ω = π ℑ G k T ai r * ( ) { ( ) } u B 2 where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is the absolute temperature of the cell ( in Kelvin ) , a is the radius of the nanoparticles , ω τ = ∕ 1 , τ is the time lag , and Δ τ ℑ ⟨ ⟩ r { ( ) } u 2 is the Fourier transform of Δ τ ⟨ ⟩ r ( ) 2 , the time - lag - dependent , ensemble - averaged MSD . The above equation can be solved analytically 60 , which allows the frequency - dependent elastic modulus to be calculated algebraically using the relationship ω ω ω = ∣ ∣ π ′     G G a ( ) * ( ) cos ( ) 2 where ω Δ ω α ω ∣ ∣ = π ⟨ ∕ ⟩Γ + G k T a r * ( ) 2 3 ( 1 ) ( 1 ( ) ) B 2 Here , α is the local logarithmic slope of Δ ω ⟨ ∕ ⟩ r ( 1 ) 2 at the frequency of interest and Γ is the gamma function . The elastic modulus , ′ G , describes the propensity of a complex fluid to store energy . Atomic force microscopy . Conical tip . AFM was conducted with a DAFM - 2X Bioscope ( Veeco , Woodbury , NY ) mounted on an Axiovert 100 microscope ( Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) using triangular silicon nitride cantilevers with a conical tip ( Veeco ; model DNP - 10 ) for indentation over the cell lamella ( as opposed to the cell nucleus ) . The indentation was carried out at a 1 - Hz loading rate and a ramp size of 3 μ m . The spring constant of the cantilever , calibrated by resonance measurements , was typically 0 . 06 N m – 1 . To quantify cellular stiffness , we collected about 80 force – distance curves from 18 cells in four different samples and analyzed them according to the Hertz model modified for a conical probe , θ ν = π − F Ed 2 tan ( 1 ) 2 2 where F is the indentation force , d is the indentation distance , θ is the half - angle of the cone , ν is the Poisson’s ratio of the sample , and E is the Young’s modulus of the sample . Sharp tip . The cells were plated on a 50 - mm optical dish ( Fluorodish ; World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , FL ) 48 h before experiments . AFM nanoindentation was performed with an MFP3D - BIO atomic force microscope ( Asylum Research , Santa Barbara , CA ) mounted on an IX - 71 inverted optical microscope ( Olympus America , Center Valley , PA ) equipped with an iXon + EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) . We indented the cells with an MLCT probe ( Bruker , Santa Barbara , CA ) that has a soft ( nominal spring constant k = 0 . 01 N m – 1 ) Si x N y cantilever with a sharp ( nominal radius r = 10 nm ) Si x N y tip . Measurements were performed in the growth medium at 37 °C . Each cell was indented at two locations : one location over the nuclear region , and one location over the cytoplasm ( lamella ) . These locations were selected to ensure that the region was relatively flat and not too close to any neighboring cells . At each location , the cell was indented ten times , with 1 min between each indentation . The loading rate was 2 µ m s – 1 and the trigger force ( the applied force at which the probe is retracted ) was 600 pN . The same experiment was conducted with an intermediate - sized LRCH - 750 probe ( Nanoscience Instruments , Phoenix , AZ ) ( r = 680 nm ; k = 0 . 214 N m – 1 ) wherein cells were indented 3 – 4 times over only the nuclear region . The loading rate was 2 µ m s – 1 and the trigger force—the applied force at which the probe is retracted—was 8 . 5 nN . Data - processing method . For all force – indentation curves , we corrected the virtual deflection by fitting a line through the noncontact region and subtracting the force value of the fit line from the force value of the curve at every ( F , d ) coordinate . Contact points were determined and any pathological curves were filtered by visual inspection . The contact region of each curve was separated into 100 - nm segments starting at the contact point . Each segment was then fit separately to the contact model to get the effective modulus at the corresponding depth . The geometry of the contact determines the power law exponent and prefactors relating the ( F , d ) data to the elastic modulus . Segments are linearized to the model and then least - squares linear regression is performed to find the best value of the modulus . For the conical - indenter model , θ ν = π − F Ed 2 tan ( 1 ) 2 2 where F is the indentation force , d is the indentation distance , θ is the half - angle of the cone , ν is the Poisson’s ratio of the sample , and E is the Young’s modulus of the sample . The intermediate - sized LRCH - 750 tips were fit with a blunted cone model introduced by Briscoe et al . 7 , θ θ θ θ θ θ θ θ θ = −ν − π− − + − + − + − − − π− = − ∕ ∕ −                   F E ad a R a a R a R R a R R d a R a R a a R a 2 ( 1 ) 2tan 2 sin cos 3 ( cos ) cos 2tan cos 3 [ ( cos ) ] tan 2 sin cos 0 2 2 1 3 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 where R is the apex radius of the tip and a is the contact radius the probe forms with the sample . The latter equation is numerically solved for a given d , and the former is approximated by a power - law equation over the defined segment . The segment is linearized by the approximate power law and fit in the same manner as the conical - indenter model . Spherical probe . We used a Bioscope catalyst ( Bruker / Veeco ) atomic force microscope placed on a Nikon U2000 confocal Eclipse C1 microscope , and a standard cantilever holder cell for operation in liquids . To record force curves over the cell surface and simultaneously record cell topography , we used the force – volume mode of operation . This is important because the mechanical ( Hertz ) models used to derive the Young’s modulus have been developed for an indenter deforming a surface of known ( spherical ) geometry . Thus , we processed force curves collected only near the top of the cell , which can typically be approximated as a spherical surface . The force curves were collected with the vertical ramp size within 5 – 6 µ m to ensure that the AFM probe detaches from the cell after each retraction . The AFM probe moves up and down during the force collection with a frequency of 1 Hz to reasonably minimize viscoelastic effects while keeping the total measurement time relatively short . It is impossible to avoid viscoelastic effects completely , and to be consistent , we performed all measurements with the same ramping speed . The force – volume images of cells were collected with a resolution of 16 × 16 pixels ( typically within a 50 × 50 µ m 2 area ) . A relatively flat ( as described above ; < 10 – 15° of inclination angle with respect to the cell topmost point ) area around the top ( nucleus region of the cell ) was identified . It gave about ten force curves per cell . The global position of the AFM probe at the beginning of the scanning was controlled by the optical microscope . The measurement methodology can be found in refs 28 , 61 . An NPoint closed - loop scanner ( 200 × 200 × 30 μ m , XYZ ) was used in this study . A large vertical closed - loop Z - range was particularly important because the cell height was > 10 μ m . A closed loop is important for quantitative description of the force curves with such an extended scan range . AFM probe : spherical indenter . A V - shaped standard narrow 200 - µ m AFM tipless cantilever ( Veeco , Santa Barbara , CA ) was used throughout the study . A 4 . 5 – 5 - µ m - diameter silica ball ( Bangs Labs , Inc . ) was glued to the cantilever as described in ref . 62 . We measured the radius of the probe by imaging the inverse grid ( TGT1 by NAtuRE MEtHODS | www . nature . com / naturemethods © 2018 Nature America Inc . , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved . AnAlysis NaTure MeThods NT - NGT , Russia ) . The cantilever spring constant was measured via the thermal tuning method before the spherical probe was glued . Data - processing method . The force curves were processed through the cell – brush model 28 , 63 . Briefly , the cell is considered in this model as a homogeneous isotropic medium covered with entropic brush 64 . Consequently , during cell deformation , the AFM probe squeezes the brush , which in turn deforms the cell body . Deflection of the cantilever d results from mechanical deformation of the substrate and long - range force . The loading force F is estimated on the basis of Hooke’s law , F = kd , where k is the spring constant of the cantilever . The presented geometry implies the following relation between the parameters : = − + + h Z Z i d ( 1 ) 0 Here , Z is the vertical position of the cantilever , Z 0 is the value when Z is at a nondeformed position of the sample , i is the deformation of the substrate at the point of contact , and h is the separation between the AFM probe and the substrate . Z is assigned with Z = 0 at the maximum allowable deflection d max . AFM allows users to directly collect the parameters Z and d ( so - called raw data ) . For the case of an AFM probe with well - defined geometry ( e . g . , a spherical probe ) and a homogeneous isotropic material , we can use a particular case of the Hertzian model 52 , which implies that = + ∕       i kd E R R RR 9 16 ( 2 ) s s 2 3 where R s is the radius of curvature of the substrate at the point of contact . Poisson’s ratio was chosen to be equal to 0 . 5 for simplicity .

Specifically , it is done in two steps . First , the Young’s modulus E of the substrate is found , assuming h = 0 at the moment of maximum load . Using equation ( 3 ) , one can arrive at = + − − + ≈ + − − + ∣ ∕ ∕ ∕ − ∕ ∕ →            E k R R RR d d Z d d kd R R RR d d Z d d 9 16 3 8 2 3 ( 4 ) d d s s max23 2 3 max 2 3 max12 s s max max 3 2 max After that , one can find the force due to brush of the adsorbed molecules by the following equation : = − + − − − ∕ ∕ ∕       h d Z k E R R RR d d d d ( ) 9 16 ( ) ( ) ( 5 ) s s 2 3 max23 2 3 max where F = kd .

As before , this formula is a good approximation for 0 . 2 < h / L < 0 . 8 . A nonlinear curve fitting of equations ( 4 ) – ( 6 ) allows one to derive both the Young’s modulus of the cell body and parameters of the brush ( length and grafting density ) . Statistics . For AFM measurement , 20 and 60 cells were measured with a conical probe at 25 °C and 6 μ m s – 1 and at 37 °C and 2 μ m s – 1 , respectively . With spherical probes , 30 , 10 , and 20 cells were measured at 37 °C and 2 μ m s – 1 with the 750 - nm - radius probe , 25 °C and 6 μ m s – 1 with the 2 , 500 - nm - radius probe , and 37 °C and 10 μ m s – 1 with the 2 , 500 - nm - radius probe , respectively .

For Fig . 5i , a two - tailed Student’s t - test was used , with P = 0 . 05 used as the threshold for significance . Reporting Summary .
