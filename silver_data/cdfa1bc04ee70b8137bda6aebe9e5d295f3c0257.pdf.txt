REVI E W Open Access SOX2 and cancer : current research and its implications in the clinic Kasia Weina 1 , 2 and Jochen Utikal 1 , 2 * Abstract SOX2 is a gene that encodes for a transcription factor belonging to the SOX gene family and contains a high - mobility group ( HMG ) domain , which permits highly specific DNA binding . Consequently , SOX2 functions as an activator or suppressor of gene transcription . SOX2 has been described as an essential embryonic stem cell gene and moreover , a necessary factor for induced cellular reprogramming . SOX2 research has only recently switched focus from embryogenesis and development to SOX2 ’ s function in disease . Particularly , the role of SOX2 in cancer pathogenesis has become of interest in the field . To date , studies have shown SOX2 to be amplified in various cancer types and affect cancer cell physiology via involvement in complicated cell signaling and protein - protein interactions . Recent reviews in this field have highlighted SOX2 in mammalian physiology , development and pathology . In this review , we comprehensively compile what is known to date about SOX2 ’ s involvement in cancer biology , focusing on the most recent findings in the fields of cellular signaling and cancer stem cells . Lastly , we underscore the role of SOX2 in the clinic and highlight new findings , which may provide novel clinical applications for SOX2 as a prognostic marker , indicator of metastasis , biomarker or potential therapeutic target in some cancer types . Keywords : SOX2 ; Stem cell marker ; Reprogramming ; Cancer ; Cancer stem cells ; Biomarker ; Prognosis Introduction The SOX family is a group of related transcription factors that have demonstrated their importance in developmen - tal and stem cell biology . In 1990 , pioneering research discovered the mammalian testis - determining factor and the gene was termed Sry due to its corresponding location in the sex - determining region on the Y - chromosome [ 1 , 2 ] . Sry contains a distinctive high - mobility group ( HMG ) domain , which permits precise DNA recognition and bin - ding . Proteins that contain the HMG domain with amino acid similarity of 50 % or higher to the HMG domain of Sry are termed SOX ( abbreviation for Sry - related HMG box ) proteins [ 3 - 5 ] . Known functions of these proteins range from regulation of embryonic development and stem cell maintenance to homeostasis in adult tissues [ 6 ] . In 1994 , the SOX2 gene , one of the SOX family mem - bers , was discovered and characterized in humans [ 7 ] . The SOX2 gene is located on chromosome 3q26 . 3 – q27 , belongs to the SOXB1 group and encodes for a protein consisting of 317 amino acids ( Figure 1A ) [ 7 , 8 ] . SOX2 is comprised of three main domains : N - terminal , HMG and transactivation domain ( Figure 1B ) . SOX2 research thus far has heavily emphasized its crucial role in stem cell maintenance , lineage fate determinant and a neces - sary factor to reprogram somatic cells back towards pluripotency [ 5 , 9 , 10 ] . In disease , SOX2 alterations have been associated with developmental maladies , such as anophthalmia - esophageal - genital ( AEG ) syndrome , which occurs when there is a heterozygous mutation of SOX2 that leads to abnormal development of ectodermal and endodermal tissues [ 11 ] . Aside from developmental diseases , accruing research has strongly associated SOX2 with cancer . Here , we consolidate SOX2 ’ s role in cancer and provide a comprehensive overview of the field , focusing on the la - test research that has implicated SOX2 in cancer biology and in the clinic . SOX2 has been shown to be associated with numerous cancer types , even described in some cases * Correspondence : j . utikal @ dkfz . de 1 Skin Cancer Unit , German Cancer Research Center ( DKFZ ) , Heidelberg , Germany 2 Department of Dermatology , Venereology and Allergology , University Medical Center Mannheim , Ruprecht - Karls - Universität Heidelberg , Theodor - Kutzer - Ufer 1 - 3 , 68135 Mannheim , Germany © 2014 Weina and Utikal ; licensee Springer .

Lastly , we investigate recent work that has highlighted the role of SOX2 in the clinic , particularly its influence on prognosis , therapy resistance and potential therapeutic interventions . Review SOX2 and cancer biology : current research SOX2 amplification in cancer Tumor development occurs when a cell accumulates genetic alterations that modify normal cell cycle pro - gression . There are several means of genetic aberrations including gene deletions or gene amplification . Gene amplification is defined as a copy number increase of a particular chromosomal region . SOX2 amplification is due to multiplication of the 3q26 . 3 gene locus [ 12 , 13 ] . SOX2 amplification has previously been found in several cancer types including glioblastoma , small - cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) and many forms of squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) [ 12 , 14 - 20 ] . A summary of SOX2 ampli - fication in various cancer types with corresponding refe - rences can be found in Table 1 . The latest SOX2 studies have focused on the co - amplification of SOX2 with other critical genes . Justilien and colleagues revealed the co - amplification of two on - cogenes , PRKCI and SOX2 , is responsible for the cancer stem cell phenotype seen in lung squamous cell carci - noma ( LSCC ) [ 61 ] . Moreover , another study performed FISH analysis in 447 resected non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tissue samples and SOX2 amplification was associated with increased gene copy number of FGFR1 and PI3KCA genes [ 62 ] . SOX2 ’ s involvement in cancer cell physiology varies between cancer types As described by Hanahan and Weinberg , cancer is a disease characterized by determined hallmarks some of which are : sustained proliferative signaling , activation of invasion and metastasis , and evasion of cell death [ 73 ] . Studies have strongly associated SOX2 to these respec - tive cancer hallmarks and thus far SOX2 has been shown to promote cellular proliferation ( breast , prostate , pancreatic and cervical cancers ) [ 21 , 28 , 57 , 58 ] , evade apop - totic signals ( prostate , gastric cancer and NSCLC ) [ 37 , 58 , 63 ] and promote invasion , migration and metas - tasis ( melanoma , colorectal , glioma , gastric , ovarian Figure 1 SOX2 homology , structure and protein function . ( A ) SOX2 belongs to the SOXB1 of SOX proteins . There is large homology between the SOXB1 group and they all contain three major domains : N - terminal , HMG and C - terminal domain . ( B ) SOX2 protein domains play several functional roles . The HMG domain of SOX2 remains fairly conserved between homo sapiens , Mus musculus and Danio rerio ( Swiss - Prot : P48431 , P48432 , Q6P0E1 ) . The HMG domain also serves as potential binding sites for protein partners . Moreover , nuclear import signals ( NIS ) and nuclear export signals ( NES ) bind to the HMG domain regulating SOX2 itself . Lastly the transactivation domain functions as the region responsible for promoter binding , which in turn leads to activation or repression of target genes .

We summarized SOX2 amplification and resulting al - terations in cellular functions in all cancer types in Table 1 and showed examples of SOX2 ’ s role in oncogenic signaling in Figure 2 . Below we highlight a few functional ex - amples of SOX2 in cancer before we review the latest SOX2 research in different aspects of cancer physiology including : cellular proliferation , apoptosis and invasion / migration / metastasis . For a complementary and closer examination into SOX2 and oncogenic signaling , protein - protein inter - actions and miRNAs see review by Liu et al . [ 74 ] . Cellular proliferation is tightly regulated by SOX2 in many cancer types . SOX2 knockdown in pancreatic cancer cells resulted in cell growth inhibition through cell cycle arrest , not apoptosis , via the transcriptional induction of p21 Cip1 and p27 Kip1 [ 57 ] . When SOX2 was overexpressed , cell proliferation was promoted through cyclinD3 ( CCND3 ) transcriptional induction and allowed further S - phase entry ( Figure 2B ) [ 57 ] . Recently , Hütz and colleagues confirmed this in gastric cancer [ 37 ] . SOX2 was functionally inhibited via cellular transfection with a tetracycline - inducible C - terminally truncated version of SOX2 , termed dnSOX2 . Despite lacking the transacti - vation domain , dnSOX2 could bind SOX2 recognition sites on DNA and compete with wild - type SOX2 . This inhibition led to the decrease in cellular proliferation in AZ - 521 cells and further analysis using a RNA gene expression microarray , revealed an upregulation of p21 and downregulation of Δ p63 ( splice variant of p63 ) [ 37 ] . Additionally , Fang and colleagues found in LSCC , SOX2 - silencing inhibited cellular proliferation via the upregulation of BMP4 [ 64 ] .

SOX2 in cancer functions through multiple mechanisms that vary depending on the cancer type . However , in most cases , SOX2 has been shown to increase cell proliferation , invasion , migration , metastasis and self - renewal of CSCs . In addition , some of these phenotypes have been linked to particular oncogenic pathways , including WNT / β - CATENIN , EGFR , mTOR and HH signaling . ↑ = Promotes / Improves . ↓ = Suppresses / Inhibits . ↑↓ = Conflicting research .

The authors therefore suggest that BMP4 is play - ing a tumor suppressor role in LSCC , while SOX2 repression of BMP4 transcription causes cell growth [ 64 ] . It ’ s important to note that the involvement of SOX2 in cell proliferation has been controversially dis - cussed in colorectal and gastric cancer [ 30 , 31 , 37 , 38 ] . The contradictory effect of SOX2 in cell proliferation suggests that SOX2 plays a differential role depending on the type of cancer ( Figure 2B ) . SOX2 also plays an important role in evading apoptotic signals . In prostate cancer , in vitro and in vivo xenograft experiments using DU145 SOX2 - overexpressing cells in NOD / SCID mice revealed that SOX2 caused an increase in apoptotic resistance by decreasing store - operated Ca 2 + entry via repressing ORAI1 expression ( Figure 2 ) [ 58 ] . Equivalently , upon silencing of SOX2 in NSCLC cell lines , apoptosis was induced [ 63 ] . Hütz and colleagues , in addition to proliferation analysis , investigated apoptosis using , caspase 3 / 7 assays performed in AZ - 521 gastric cancer cells [ 37 ] . After 48 hours of SOX2 inhibition , nearly 60 % of cells were apoptotic compared to only 20 – 40 % of the control cells [ 37 ] . These studies prove SOX2 ’ s involve - ment in apoptosis inhibition and therefore in direct pro - motion of uncontrolled cell growth . Finally , research has indicated that SOX2 is a novel regulator of cell invasion , migration and metastasis . For example in melanoma , SOX2 knockdown in A2058 cells resulted in a 4 . 5 - fold decrease in invasion in vitro and adopted this phenotype via the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) - 3 [ 49 ] . Likewise in colorectal cells , SOX2 was involved in cellular migration and inva - sion in vitro , but mediated these effects through MMP - 2 [ 29 ] . This invasive phenotype was also confirmed in ma - lignant glioma , since siRNA - mediated downregulation of SOX2 resulted in a significant decrease in migration and invasion capabilities [ 15 ] . Moreover SOX2 over - expression in the SOX2 - negative glioma cell line U - 87 resulted in a significant increase in the number of mi - gratory and invasive cells [ 15 ] . Numerous gain and loss of function studies in several cancer types ( gastric cancer , ovarian cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma ) re - inforced the link between SOX2 and cellular invasion and migration [ 15 , 37 , 47 , 55 ] . Recently , Yang and colleagues showed SOX2 ’ s involvement in promoting invasion and migration in laryngeal cancer cells through the induction of MMP - 2 and the PI3K / AKT / mTOR path - way ( Figure 2A ) [ 48 ] . SOX2 and cancer stem cells : current research Many tumors are derived from a single cell that has undergone malignant transformation through the acqui - sition of genomic aberrations , e . g . gene amplification , mutations or other mechanisms [ 75 ] . Clonal expansion of cells with tumorigenic properties is the next step to - wards tumor initiation . These selected cells have the ability to evade normal cell cycle checkpoints , rapidly proliferate and invade tissues [ 73 , 75 ] . The orchestration of tumor initiation and maintenance has been shown in some cancers to be driven by cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) , also termed tumor - initiating cells or cancer stem - like cells . These CSCs may acquire tumor - initiating and self - renewal properties through similar molecular mecha - nisms governing cellular reprogramming [ 76 ] . Evidence has linked induced cellular reprogramming to cancer and led to the assumption that CSCs may arise via a reprogramming - related mechanism [ 77 - 79 ] . The reacti - vation of stem cell - associated markers or pluripotency factors may cause dedifferentiation and a more stem cell - like state [ 76 ] . Sussman and colleagues discovered that the ubiquitin - specific protease 22 ( USP22 ) is respon - sible for controlling the cellular transition from stemness towards differentiation [ 80 ] . Moreover they found USP22 represses the SOX2 promoter in order to control the em - bryonic stem cell transition from self - renewal to differenti - ation [ 80 ] Therefore , not only is SOX2 an essential stem cell marker but its suppression is mandatory for cellular differentiation . For these reasons , SOX2 has been heavily investigated in CSCs in several cancer types . SOX2 regulates self - renewal and maintenance in cancer stem cell populations SOX2 has shown to increase CSC markers in ovarian , pancreatic , lung cancer , but research also has proven its function in self - renewal [ 57 , 81 , 82 ] . Self - renewal capacity of a CSC is critical and enables the maintenance of the CSC subpopulation within a tumor and SOX2 has shown to mediate this in breast , gastric , ovarian , pros - tate cancer , glioma , osteosarcoma , lung adenocarcinoma ( See figure on previous page . ) Figure 2 Influence of SOX2 on oncogenic - related processes and transcription . ( A ) SOX2 is an important regulator of cellular processes related to cancer . Some of these processes include but aren ’ t limited to WNT / β - CATENIN signaling , EMT and JAK / STAT3 signaling . In most cases , SOX2 functions downstream in the nucleus . SOX2 ’ s activity leads to further downstream effects and finally alters cellular phenotypes such as cellular survival , invasion and metastasis . ( B ) SOX2 is typically regulating processes downstream on a transcriptional level . There are several examples of SOX2 influencing cancer phenotypes by repressing or activating particular target genes including EMT promotion via binding to the promoter regions of SNAIL , SLUG and TWIST . Therefore , SOX2 functions in cancer as a key transcription factor . Weina and Utikal Clinical and Translational Medicine 2014 , 3 : 19 Page 5 of 10 http : / / www . clintransmed . com / content / 3 / 1 / 19 and NSCLC [ 15 , 42 , 54 , 59 , 65 , 66 , 77 , 82 , 83 ] . Studies in gas - tric cancer using siRNA - mediated SOX2 knockdown , found reduced spheroid colony formation and increased apoptosis within sphere cells , highlighting the importance of SOX2 in self - renewal capacity [ 83 ] . In prostate cancer stem cells , the activation of EGFR signaling increased SOX2 expression and the self - renewal capacity [ 59 ] . Singh and colleagues showed similar results in NSCLC , when siRNA - mediated SOX2 knockdown led to a 2 . 5 - fold re - duction in sphere formation [ 65 ] . Moreover , EGFR / Src / Akt signaling influenced SOX2 protein expression since during EGFR or SRC inhibition using gefitinib or BIBW , respectively , levels of SOX2 were considerably decreased [ 65 ] . Taken together , SOX2 mediates self - renewal of CSCs through EGFR signaling in at least two cancer types and is a major mediator of self - renewal in several cancers through mechanisms that remain unclear . Recent CSC studies have concentrated on SOX2 and its mechanisms in cancer stem cell maintenance and regulation . Santini and colleagues investigated SOX2 in melanoma initiating cells and Hedgehog - GLI ( HH - GLI ) signaling [ 50 ] . They functionally showed that the ectopic expression of SOX2 in vitro caused enhanced self - renewal capacity in melanoma cells . Moreover , GLI1 and GLI2 downstream transcription factors of HH - GLI Signaling were able to bind to the proximal promoter of SOX2 in primary melanoma cells in chromatin immunoprecipita - tion ( ChIP ) studies and therefore SOX2 is regulated by HH signaling [ 50 ] . To a similar extent , Justilien and colleagues heavily investigated Hedgehog ( Hh ) acyltrans - ferase ( HHAT ) in LSCC and found that not only are PRKCI and SOX2 coamplified and cooperate in LSCC but also SOX2 becomes phosphorylated by Protein Kinase C ι ( PKC ι ) [ 61 ] . Next , phosphorylated SOX2 is recruited and required for HHAT expression and therefore maintenance of the stem - cell phenotype . The authors provide evidence that the coamplifcation of both oncogenes is required to activate the PKCi - SOX2 - HHAT signaling axis which impels the stem cell pheno - type . Further work is being done on establishing PKC ι inhibitors for LSCC treatment [ 61 ] . Lastly , a recent publication by Favaro and colleagues proved that SOX2 is required for in vitro CSC mainten - ance in a high - grade oligodendroglioma mouse model [ 43 ] . Oligodenrogliomas were generated in mice via the transduction of PDGF - B - IRES - GFP - encoding retrovirus within the brain at embryonic day 14 . 5 . Additionally these embryos carried a homozygous SOX2 flox mutation , which allowed authors to excise SOX2 using lentiviral Cre recombinase virus . Wild - type oligodendroglioma cells from mentioned mouse model were transplanted into the brain of C57 / Bl6 mice , which generated lethal tumors . However , when SOX2 - deletion cells were transplanted into C57 / Bl6 mice they remained tumor free [ 43 ] . This elegant study proved the obligatory function of SOX2 in oligodendroglioma tumor initiation . The requirement of SOX2 in oligodendroglioma suggested possible thera - peutic intervention . Correlations between SOX2 and clinical outcome : current research SOX2 has proven its functional role in various aspects of cancer biology . Research on SOX2 has also investi - gated its importance in the clinic in respect to disease prognosis , relapse , therapy resistance , comprehensive summary in Table 2 . The ability to improve reliability of diagnosis or prognosis of a cancer patient can have immense impact on survival and better understanding of the disease . For example , 162 esophageal squamous cancer patients were analyzed for SOX2 and OCT3 / 4 ex - pression and high expression of both markers was associ - ated with higher histological grade or TNM stage ( p < 0 . 001 for both factors ) , demonstrating their link to dedif - ferentiation in these tumors ( Table 2 ) [ 84 ] . Furthermore , a significant correlation between high SOX2 levels and decreasing patient survival was shown ( p < 0 . 001 ) [ 84 ] . Recently , Forghanifard and colleagues revealed that stemness state regulators SALL4 and SOX2 are over - expressed in 64 esophageal cancer samples and co - overexpression correlated with depth of tumor invasion and metastasis [ 85 ] . Again , contrasting results for SOX2 ’ s role in the clinic were highlighted in lung cancer ( including NSCLC and SCLC ) , where SOX2 was corre - lated to improved survival and better patient outcome [ 62 , 67 , 68 , 86 - 88 ] . These opposing outcomes in the clinic further underscore the differing role of SOX2 in varying cancer types . SOX2 ’ s influence on therapy resistance Drug resistance has been associated with expression of various pluripotency markers , including NANOG , OCT4 and SOX2 , since these genes typically lead to a decrease in differentiation status [ 68 ] . In breast cancer , silencing SOX2 not only reduced the size of the CSC population but also restored tamoxifen sensitivity , suggesting tam - oxifen resistance is primarily driven by SOX2 in breast CSCs [ 89 ] . Recently , Dogan and colleagues investigated SOX2 and EGFR inhibitors in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines [ 68 ] . When a SOX2 knockdown using shRNA was performed in HCC827 cells , decreased proliferation was observed along with increased sensitivity to erlotinib . Furthermore , upon the treatment with PI3K / AKT inhibi - tors , SOX2 expression decreased [ 68 ] . Therefore , targeting SOX2 in EGFR - mutant tumors may be therapeutically beneficial ; however more direct targeting strategies need to be further developed .

SOX2 has shown its potential to become a useful biomarker in the clinic for some cancer types , for both staging tumors and identification of the CSC subpopula - tions ( Table 2 ) . Utilizing SOX2 for cancer therapy may open a window to new therapeutic opportunities . SOX2 does not lend itself for direct therapeutic intervention due to its importance in transcriptional cellular function and targeting SOX2 may have dozens of unwanted complica - tions . However , targeting signals upstream or downstream of SOX2 may prove beneficial in cancer therapy . For ex - ample , as mentioned above in NSCLC and prostate CSCs , SOX2 relies heavily on EGFR signaling for mediating self - renewal in CSCs . Currently , anticancer drugs are on the market targeting EGFR , such as gefitinib and erlotinib , and may be useful in inhibiting SOX2 ’ s downstream self - renewal effects , however resistance to these therapies is nearly inevitable and needs to be overcome . Therefore , further targeting SOX2 in EGFR - mutant cancer with PI3K / AKT inhibitors , as shown above in lung adeno - carcinoma cell lines , may yield better results [ 68 ] . Recently published studies have attempted to tackle SOX2 therapy and its implications . Favaro and colleagues , who performed the oligodenroglioma studies in mice , fur - ther examined SOX2 peptides for immunotherapy treat - ment in mice [ 43 ] . The C57BL / 6 N mice were injected with wild - type oligodendroglioma cells from established Table 2 Clinical relevance of SOX2 Cancer type Function in the clinic References Breast Promotes Tamoxifen resistance via WNT signaling activation in CSCs [ 21 , 27 , 89 ] ZF - based ATF therapy effective for downregulation of SOX2 Expression correlates with TNM stage and histological grade Colorectal Prognostic marker for metastasis [ 29 , 32 ] Associated with poor patient prognosis Associated with distant metastasis and lymph - node metastasis Esophageal Co - expression with OCT3 / 4 significantly associated with higher histological stage [ 84 , 85 , 90 ] Co - expression with OCT3 / 4 correlated to poorer survival Co - expression with SALL4 correlates to depth of tumor invasion and metastasis CD44 and SOX2 is correlated to poor survival Gastric Associated with poor prognosis [ 38 , 41 ] SOX2 methylation correlates to significantly shorter survival time Predicts immunotherapy response Hepatocellular carcinoma Expression correlates with metastasis [ 47 ] Expression correlates with low survival rate Lung , NSCLC , Squamous cell lung cancer Associated with better survival independent of histological subtype [ 62 , 67 , 68 , 86 - 88 ] Expression is a positive prognostic marker SOX2 amplification and upregulation are frequent events linked to favorable prognosis Important tumor - associated antigen Associates SOX2 - positive T - cells to patient response to immunotherapy Increases resistance to EGFR inhibitors Melanoma Novel biomarker for normal skin subpopulation responsible for tumorigenesis [ 52 , 53 ] SOX2 and Nestin differentiate between nevi and melanoma metastasis SOX2 and Nestin powerful diagnostic tools Ovarian Expression directly proportional to higher degree of malignancy [ 56 , 82 ] Responsible for CSC therapy resistance Rectal Predicts poor distance recurrence for preoperative CRT patients [ 91 ] Predicts poor prognosis for preoperative CRT patients Sinonasal SOX2 amplification identifies carcinomas more likely to relapse [ 71 ] The role of SOX2 in the clinic has been studied and expression has been correlated to patient survival , prognosis and therapy . SOX2 has been shown to play different roles depending on cancer type and can predict both better and worse outcomes for patients . Moreover , SOX2 has proven its use as a prognostic marker in melanoma , colorectal , gastric and lung cancer .

Simi - larly , Polakova and colleagues developed an experimental DNA vaccine against SOX2 [ 92 ] . In this study , C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice were immunized with DNA vaccine and found a significant SOX2 - specific activation of lympho - cytes . However , when the antitumor effects were exam - ined using TC - 1 / B7 ( derived from lung cancer cell line TC - 1 ) cells the DNA vaccination did not prevent tumor development even though it was able to significantly reduce tumor growth [ 92 ] . Conclusion : SOX2 in the future SOX2 has proven not only to be an essential embryonic , reprogramming and development - associated gene but has begun to leave its footprint in the field of oncology . SOX2 is intricately involved in many cancer - associated processes such as cell proliferation , evading cellular apop - tosis and metastasis via interactions with EGFR signaling and several other oncogenic pathways and processes . Moreover , current and ongoing SOX2 CSC research has emphasized the importance of investigating early devel - opmental genes , since they may be responsible for self - renewal of CSCs . Lastly , in clinical settings , SOX2 has shown a heavy influence on patient survival and prog - nosis . In summary , SOX2 function in cancer has been accentuated in numerous cancer types in and out of the clinic and investigating SOX2 ’ s oncogenic course is important for future prognosis , survival of cancer patients and possible therapeutic interventions .
