In striated muscle , it is believed that tight capping of the fast - growing ( barbed ) ends by CapZ and of the slow - growing ( pointed ) ends by tropomodulin ( Tmod ) stabilizes the uniform lengths of actin ( thin ) filaments in myofibrils . Here we demonstrate for the first time that both CapZ and Tmod are dynamic on the basis of the rapid incorporation of microin - jected rhodamine - labelled actin ( rho - actin ) at both barbed and pointed ends and from the photobleaching of green fluo - rescent protein ( GFP ) - labelled Tmod . Unexpectedly , the inhibition of actin dynamics at pointed ends by GFP – Tmod over - expression results in shorter thin filaments , whereas the inhibition of actin dynamics at barbed ends by cytochalasin D has no effect on length . These data demonstrate that the actin filaments in myofibrils are relatively dynamic despite the presence of capping proteins , and that regulated actin assembly at pointed ends determines the length of thin filaments . A ctin capping proteins contribute to the organization and turnover of complex actin filament structures by regulating actin monomer dynamics at filament ends 1 – 4 . It is generally believed that , in non - muscle cells , actin filaments turn over in vivo primarily by monomer addition and growth at the fast - growing ( barbed ) ends and by monomer loss and shortening from the slow - growing ( pointed ) ends ( that is , by treadmilling processes ) 4 – 7 . These ideas are consistent with the measured rates of actin assem - bly and disassembly from the barbed and pointed ends in vitro 8 and properties of the monomer pool in vivo 4 . Barbed - end and pointed - end capping proteins are thought to influence the length and sta - bility of individual filaments by terminating growth at the barbed ends and by preventing shortening at the pointed ends , respective - ly 1 – 4 . Thus , the extent of filament capping within a particular fila - ment structure is thought to influence the function of the structure as well as whether it is relatively dynamic or stable . In non - muscle cells , considerable support for barbed - end assembly in vivo has come from numerous studies with actin microinjection 5 , 9 – 12 and permeabilized cells 10 , 13 . These studies iden - tified barbed filament ends as the sites of actin assembly in vivo , on the basis of their characteristic location at the leading edge of cells 4 , together with reagents that bind to barbed ends and inhibit actin incorporation , for example cytochalasin D ( cytoD ) or CapZ 2 , 10 , 14 . However , direct evidence for the disassembly ( or assembly ) at actin filament pointed ends in vivo has been difficult to obtain because of the complex architecture of filaments in motile cells , the irregular location of actin filament pointed ends and the inherent difficulties in observing disassembly events . Thus , the properties of the point - ed ends in vivo ( that is , their actin dynamics and extent of capping ) and their significance for the regulation of filament lengths and cytoskeletal function remain unknown 1 – 4 . Specifically , the relative importance of barbed - end and pointed - end actin dynamics in vivo is not known for dynamic or stable structures . In this study we have taken advantage of the regular organization of actin ( thin ) filaments in striated muscle sarcomeres to investigate directly the relationship between actin monomer dynamics , point - Table 1 Visual scoring of rho - actin incorporation sites in cardiac myocytes Experiment Treatment Z > > P Z ≈ P Z < < P n A Control 2 % 93 % 5 % 195 B 0 . 2 % DMSO 14 % 86 % 0 % 88 20 nM CytoD 0 % 34 % 66 % 137 200 nM CytoD 0 % 3 % 97 % 107 C GFP – Tmod 94 % 6 % 0 % 72 GFP 0 % 100 % 0 % 13 Untransfected 23 % 77 % 0 % 31 Combined control 16 % 84 % 0 % 44 A , Cells microinjected with rho - actin ( control ) ; B , cells treated with CytoD or DMSO that were microinjected with rho - actin ; C , untransfected cells , GFP - expressing cells or GFP – Tmod - overexpressing cells that were microinjected with rho - actin .

Unlike other cells , both the barbed and pointed ends of the ~ 1 - m m - long thin filaments can be identified in situ because they are arranged in an anti - parallel fashion with their barbed ends aligned at the Z - line and their pointed ends aligned in the middle of the sar - comere 1 , 2 . Furthermore , actin filament capping at both barbed and pointed ends by CapZ 15 and tropomodulin ( Tmod ) 16 , 17 , respectively , is important for thin filament length regulation , sarcomere organi - zation and muscle function . In cultured skeletal myotubes , inhibi - tion of CapZ function delays the alignment of thin filaments during assembly 18 , whereas postnatal misexpression of CapZ isoforms in mouse hearts leads to cardiac hypertrophy 19 . Similarly , the inhibi - tion of Tmod capping in cultured myocytes interferes with both the assembly 20 and the maintenance 21 of thin filaments with uniform lengths , and postnatal overexpression in mouse hearts leads to dilat - ed cardiomyopathy 22 . Tight capping of both thin filament ends is thought to be crucial for filament stability and also for maintaining their uniform lengths , on the basis of the high capping affinities of CapZ 23 and Tmod 17 , 24 in vitro , their amounts in muscle 16 , 25 and the inability of fluorescent actin to incorporate into isolated myofib - rils 26 , 27 . However , numerous microinjection studies in muscle cells show that labelled actin is incorporated rapidly into thin fila - ments 28 – 31 , raising the possibility that one or both of the ends might not be tightly capped in vivo 1 . Indeed , the barbed ends of the thin filaments have been reported to be the main site of actin incorpora - tion 28 , 29 , 31 , which is consistent with expectations from treadmilling in vitro 7 and results from non - muscle cells 5 , 10 . We used the microinjection of rhodamine - labelled actin ( rho - actin ) , GFP – Tmod overexpression , photobleaching and quantita - tive image analysis to investigate the following questions in cul - tured cardiac myocytes . How does actin incorporate into thin fila - ments in vivo despite the presence of high - affinity capping proteins at both filament ends ? Further , how are uniform thin filament lengths maintained in the presence of actin dynamics at filament ends ? Unexpectedly , our results show that the pointed ends are the major sites of actin incorporation in muscle thin filaments and that treadmilling does not account for the maintenance of uniform actin filament lengths in myofibrils . Instead , Tmod dynamics at pointed ends controls the extent of actin assembly and directly determines thin filament lengths in striated muscle . Results Rho - actin incorporates at barbed and pointed ends of thin fila - ments . To define the relationship between thin - filament capping , dynamics and length in striated muscle we developed a fluorescence microscopy assay for filament capping in vivo . We reasoned that microinjected rho - actin would incorporate at thin filament ends only if they were uncapped . We microinjected rho - actin into embry - onic chick cardiac myocytes and after 1 h determined the initial sites of incorporation in thin filaments ( Table 1 ) . Unexpectedly , rho - actin was incorporated at both the barbed and pointed ends of thin filaments on the basis of colocalization with sarcomeric markers ( a - actinin , Tmod and phallacidin ) and dependence on sarcomere Rho - actin a b c d Tropomodulin Merge Rho - actin Phallacidin Merge Frame 0 Frame 3 Frame 18 * * * Position 3 2 1 0 P / B i n c o r po r a t i on r a t i o Rho - actin distance from Z - line ( m m ) Rho - actin Phall inj Phall non - inj 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 45 0 . 73 0 0 . 73 1 . 45 Distance from Z - line ( m m ) Figure 1 Rho - actin is incorporated at pointed ends and Z - lines in cardiac myocytes . a , Microinjected cardiac myocytes stained for Tmod or for F - actin with BODIPY – phallacidin .

One set of sites was located in the middle of the phallacidin bands ( arrows ) and colocalized with a - actinin ( data not shown ) at the Z - line , where the thin - filament barbed ends are locat - ed . The other set of sites was located at the edges of each phallacidin band and colocalized with Tmod at the thin filament pointed ends ( arrowheads ) . Unlike the rho - actin bands at the Z - line , the rho - actin incorporation sites at the thin filament pointed ends appeared either as single broad bands in resting - length sarcomeres or as two closely spaced but distinct bands in stretched sarcomeres in cells fixed after microinjection ( Fig . 1a , compare single with double arrowheads ) , and in live , beating cells ( Fig . 1b , compare frame 0 with frames 3 and 18 ; see also Supplementary Information , movies 1 and 2 ) . This incor - poration pattern was visible as early as 10 min after microinjection and persisted for several hours ( data not shown ) . We also observed that microinjected rho - actin was similarly localized to both thin fila - ment ends in skeletal myotubes ( data not shown ) , indicating that pointed - end and barbed - end incorporation is not specific to cardiac thin filaments . However , rho - actin incorporated only at Z - lines , not at thin filament pointed ends , in myocytes that did not survive microinjection as indicated by positive staining with sytox green ( data not shown ) . Incorporation at barbed and pointed ends sug - gested that both thin filament ends are transiently uncapped in living myocytes to allow monomer addition at the ends , and thus that CapZ and Tmod are not irreversibly bound to filament ends in vivo . To determine the relative amounts of rho - actin incorporation at thin filament ends , we analysed the fluorescence intensity distribu - tion of rho - actin with an improved deconvolution method that takes advantage of the repeating myofibril structure ( R . L . and V . M . F . , unpublished data ; see Supplementary Information ) . With this method , the fluorescence intensity of rho - actin along a myofibril is represented by serially repeating a symmetrical profile consisting of one central peak and two flanking peaks , which correspond to the fluorescence intensities at the Z - line and the thin filament pointed ends , respectively ( as in Fig . 1b , d ; see also Methods and Supplementary Information , Figs S1 and S2 ) . The application of this analysis to living and fixed cells showed that the rho - actin incorpo - ration profiles were similar along the length of a single myofibril and only changed position relative to each other during contraction Rho - actin a - Actinin Merge D M S O 50 n M C y t o D Figure 2 Cytochalasin D inhibits rho - actin incorporation at the Z - line .

Comparison of the relative areas under the pointed - end and barbed - end peaks in living and fixed cells indicated that the fluo - rescence intensity at the pointed ends with respect to the barbed ends ( P / B ratio ) was 1 . 6 ± 0 . 5 ( Fig . 1c , Table 2 ) . In contrast with the absolute rho - actin intensity at barbed and pointed ends , the P / B ratio was independent of the total amount of rho - actin monomers injected into each cell ( data not shown ) and thus per - mitted a comparison of rho - actin incorporation between different myofibrils and cells . Significantly more variation in the P / B ratio occurred between different cells than between different myofibrils within the same cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . This suggested that cellular factors affecting rho - actin incorpora - tion into myofibrils varied within cells in these cultures . Assuming equivalent fluorescence emissions per monomer at both filament ends , the P / B ratio of ~ 1 . 6 indicated that ~ 60 % of the incorporat - ed actin monomers in myofibrils were at the thin filament pointed ends . This result suggested that pointed ends are more dynamic than barbed ends in chick cardiac myocytes and was surprising because previous studies had reported that thin filament barbed ends were the predominant sites for the initial incorporation of actin 28 , 29 , 31 . However , each of these studies used actin labelled on lysine residue ( s ) , which incorporates to a relatively greater extent at Z - lines , thereby masking the incorporation at the pointed ends ( R . L . and V . M . F . , unpublished data ) . Thin filament lengths in injected myocytes seemed to remain regulated in spite of rho - actin incorporation , on the basis of the clearly visible gaps in the phallacidin staining in the middle of stretched sarcomeres ( Fig . 1a , double arrowheads ) . We used our deconvolution approach to determine thin filament lengths from phallacidin fluorescence in injected and non - injected cells ( Fig . 1d , and Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . Thin filament lengths in non - injected cells ( 0 . 78 ± 0 . 07 m m ) were not significantly different ( P > 0 . 25 ) from lengths in rho - actin - injected myocytes ( 0 . 80 ± 0 . 05 m m ) ( Table 3 ) . In addition to thin filament lengths , the deconvolu - tion analysis also determined the phallacidin intensity at the Z - line relative to the uniform staining along the thin filament ( Z / U ratio ; Table 3 ) . The Z / U ratios in both the injected ( 0 . 90 ± 0 . 31 ) and non - injected ( 0 . 91 ± 0 . 35 ) myocytes were variable and considerably lower than expected ( ~ 2 . 0 ) on the basis of the ~ 100 - nm overlap of actin fil - aments at the Z - line in cardiac cells 32 . This suggests that phallacidin might be prevented from binding to actin in the Z - line in these cells . However , microinjection of rho - actin had no significant effect on the Z / U ratio or lengths of actin filaments within the sarcomeres . However , the distance between the rho - actin peak at the point - ed end and the Z - line was significantly shorter ( 0 . 70 ± 0 . 05 m m ; P < 0 . 05 ) than were the thin filament lengths ( 0 . 80 ± 0 . 05 m m ) ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . This result , together with the unchanged thin fil - ament lengths in the microinjected cells , indicates that rho - actin monomers had exchanged with endogenous unlabelled subunits at uncapped filament ends . By contrast , if a small number of rho - actin monomers had simply polymerized from the pointed ends of the filaments , the distance of the rho - actin peak from the Z - line would have been the same as or greater than the filament lengths measured from phallacidin staining , which was not so . Cytochalasin D ( cytoD ) prevents actin incorporation at thin fila - ment barbed ends . To determine whether the extent of barbed - end capping affected actin dynamics and filament length , we treated cells with cytoD , which caps actin - filament barbed ends in vitro with a K d of 20 nM ( ref . 33 ) . In most ( 66 % ) of the microinjected myocytes treated with 50 nM cytoD in dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO ) , distinct bands of rho - actin fluorescence either were not detected or were only barely visible at Z - lines ; however , rho - actin incorporation at pointed ends seemed not to be affected ( Fig . 2 and Table 1 ) . In most ( 86 % ) control DMSO - treated myocytes , rho - actin was incorporat - ed as distinct bands at Z - lines and at pointed ends ( Fig . 2 ) , as shown previously for untreated cells . CytoD also had little if any effect on staining of a - actinin ( Fig . 2 ) or Tmod ( data not shown ) . Quantitative analysis showed that 50 nM cytoD significantly decreased ( P < 0 . 001 ) the amount of rho - actin incorporation at the Z - line with respect to the pointed ends , on the basis of a P / B ratio of 3 . 5 ± 0 . 8 in cytoD - treated cells and a ratio of 1 . 6 ± 0 . 5 in control cells ( Table 2 ) . Because cytochalasin D specifically caps barbed ends in vitro 33 , we interpret this increase in P / B ratio as indicating a spe - cific decrease in rho - actin incorporation at barbed ends . Higher concentrations of cytoD ( 200 nM , 1 h ) further decreased ( P < 0 . 001 ) the amount of rho - actin incorporation at the barbed end ( P / B ratio 6 . 2 ± 3 . 8 ) . At these high cytoD concentrations , 97 % of the cells had little or no Z - line fluorescence ( Table 1 ) . The ability of cytoD to inhibit rho - actin incorporation at the Z - line verifies that the microinjected actin polymerized onto free barbed ends , and additionally suggests that CapZ capping is dynamic in vivo . Unexpectedly , inhibition of barbed - end actin incorporation by cytoD did not lead to shorter thin filaments . Thin filament lengths determined from the phallacidin profiles were 0 . 80 ± 0 . 06 m m in control cells and remained unchanged ( P > 0 . 50 ) after 1 h of treat - ment with 50 nM cytoD ( 0 . 80 ± 0 . 04 m m ) or 200 nM cytoD ( 0 . 81 ± 0 . 05 m m ) ( Table 3 ) . However , the Z / U ratio increased significant - ly ( P < 0 . 01 ) in myocytes treated with 50 nM cytoD ( 2 . 25 ± 1 . 04 ) or 200 nM cytoD ( 2 . 35 ± 0 . 36 ) in comparison with control cells in these experiments ( 1 . 25 ± 0 . 48 ) ( Table 3 ) .

Alternatively , the increase in phallacidin staining at the Z - line might indicate that treatment with cytoD increased the number of actin filaments at the Z - line , which is consistent with the ability of cytoD to nucleate actin filaments 33 . Furthermore , many myofibrils were disrupted at the higher , 200 nM cytoD concentration and thus could not be analysed ( data not shown ) , suggesting that normal barbed - end dynamics are important for some aspects of myofibril stability 18 . Nevertheless , the constancy of thin filament lengths in the presence of cytoD indicates that monomer dynamics at barbed ends are not directly involved in maintaining filament length . Furthermore , continued exchange of actin monomers at pointed ends in the absence of barbed - end exchange did not result in thin filament shortening . Thus , a simple treadmilling mechanism 7 , 28 is unlikely to account for the maintenance of thin filament length 1 . GFP – Tmod overexpression prevents actin incorporation at point - ed ends . To investigate the effect of pointed - end capping by Tmod on rho - actin incorporation and thin filament length , we overex - pressed GFP – Tmod to inhibit actin monomer exchange at pointed ends . GFP – Tmod was targeted to thin - filament pointed ends over a wide range of expression levels ( Fig . 3a and data not shown ) , but myofibril structure was not grossly affected as assessed by the nor - mal striated organization of phalloidin staining for F - actin ( Fig . 3a ) , a - actinin and C - protein ( data not shown ) . Strikingly , the pre - dominant rho - actin incorporation sites did not colocalize with GFP – Tmod at the pointed ends and were now mainly limited to the Z - line in most ( 94 % ) of the myocytes overexpressing GFP – Tmod ( Fig . 3b and Table 1 ) . In contrast , rho - actin was incorporated at both barbed and pointed ends in most ( 84 % ) of the control untransfect - ed or GFP - transfected myocytes ( Fig . 3b and Table 1 ) , as described above . Quantitative analysis of rho - actin incorporation indicated that the P / B incorporation ratio was significantly decreased ( P < 0 . 001 ) in cells overexpressing GFP – Tmod to 0 . 8 ± 0 . 1 , in comparison with 1 . 4 ± 0 . 3 in control untransfected and GFP - transfected myocytes ( Table 2 ) . We interpret this decrease in P / B ratio resulting from GFP – Tmod overexpression as a direct effect on rho - actin incor - poration at pointed ends . This conclusion is based on the localization of GFP – Tmod at pointed ends in cardiac cells and the fact that Tmod does not cap barbed ends or bind monomers in vitro 17 . Furthermore , in preliminary experiments , injection of recombinant Tmod togeth - er with rho - actin resulted in decreased incorporation of rho - actin at pointed ends in many myocytes , which is similar to the effects of GFP – Tmod overexpression ( data not shown ) . This suggested that rho - actin incorporation into myofibrils was not altered by long - term secondary consequences of GFP – Tmod overexpression . We conclude that the extent of actin dynamics at the pointed end depends on the level of Tmod and that at least some pointed ends are not capped at endogenous levels of Tmod . GFP – Tmod exchanges rapidly at thin - filament pointed ends . To dis - tinguish between the possibilities that only some pointed ends were uncapped and others capped , or that all the pointed ends were uncapped part of the time , we directly observed Tmod dynamics by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) in GFP – Tmod - Endogenous Tmod Z a P Excess Tmod Z b P Figure 5 Model for rho - actin incorporation into thin filament ends in the presence of endogenous ( a ) and excess ( b ) levels of Tmod . a , CapZ ( small rectangles ) and Tmod ( triangles ) are transiently bound at the Z - line ( Z , large rectan - gle ) and pointed ends ( P ) of thin filaments , respectively ( top filament ) .

We reasoned that the rate and extent of FRAP would reflect the dissociation of bleached GFP – Tmod molecules from the pointed ends . Faint fluorescent striations were visible within 2 min of photobleaching and were fully recovered within 10 – 15 min ( n = 5 cells ) ( Fig . 4 ) . The half - time determined for recovery was ~ 8 min . The intensity of the GFP – Tmod striations after recovery for 15 min was the same as that of the striations before photobleaching ( Fig . 4 , prebleach ) , indicating that most bleached GFP – Tmod molecules exchanged completely with unbleached molecules . If there had been a significant population of stable , tightly capped pointed ends , then only partial recovery of fluorescence would have been expected . Thus , this result suggests that all the pointed ends are uncapped for part of the time , and that there are not two groups of ends ( that is , uncapped and capped ) that have distinct properties and actin dynamics . GFP – Tmod overexpression decreases thin filament length . To deter - mine whether the inhibition of rho - actin incorporation at pointed ends by excess Tmod influenced thin filament lengths , we compared thin filament lengths in GFP – Tmod - overexpressing cells and in con - trol cells with the use of several approaches . First , we measured the width of the phalloidin - stained bands by a manual method that per - mitted the entire cell population to be analysed . This method of analysis demonstrated that GFP – Tmod overexpression resulted in a ~ 9 % decrease ( P < 0 . 05 ) in thin filament lengths to 0 . 70 ± 0 . 08 in comparison with control untransfected ( 0 . 78 ± 0 . 08 ) and GFP - trans - fected myocytes ( 0 . 76 ± 0 . 07 ) ( Table 3 ) . Next , using the deconvolu - tion method , we also found that GFP – Tmod overexpression resulted in a ~ 6 % decrease ( P < 0 . 05 ) in thin filament lengths as determined from phalloidin profiles of myofibrils ( Table 3 ) . Consistent with these results was our observation of a ~ 10 % decrease ( P < 0 . 001 ) in the dis - tance of the minor rho - actin peak at the pointed end from the major rho - actin peak at the Z - line ( Table 2 ) . However , we detected no change in average sarcomere lengths between GFP – Tmod - transfected and GFP - transfected myocytes ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Tmod inhibition of rho - actin incorporation at thin filament pointed ends led directly to shorter filament lengths without affecting sar - comere length . Our results extend previous observations that thin fil - ament lengths are shorter after adenoviral - mediated overexpression of Tmod in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes 20 . Discussion The ability to distinguish between both thin filament ends in stri - ated muscle sarcomeres enabled us to observe actin dynamics directly at barbed and pointed ends in vivo . Our data show that actin subunits at both barbed and pointed ends are dynamic and exchange with a soluble monomer pool . This is the first direct demonstration of actin dynamics at pointed ends in any cell ; how - ever , indirect evidence for pointed - end elongation was previously obtained from the analysis of growing stereocilia in developing chick hair cells 34 . On the basis of the observed dynamics at thin fil - ament ends , we conclude that neither CapZ nor Tmod is able to sat - urate all the barbed or pointed ends , respectively , in muscle sar - comeres in vivo ( Fig . 5a ) . The rapid and complete FRAP for GFP – Tmod further indicates that Tmod rapidly binds to and disso - ciates from thin filament pointed ends . This is the first observation of capping protein exchange at filament ends in vivo . Thus , despite the stability and persistence of actin filament lengths in sarcom - eres 26 , 27 , both filament ends are dynamic in vivo , suggesting that the capping activities of CapZ and Tmod are specifically downregulat - ed in vivo . Our data do not support rapid treadmilling or insertion into the middle of the filament 7 , 28 as possible mechanisms for the initial incorporation of actin . Instead , our data support a ‘dynamic stability’ model , in which transient capping at barbed and pointed ends permits cycles of stochastic disassembly and assembly to occur , thereby resulting in rho - actin exchange with endogenous subunits ( Fig . 5a and see refs 1 , 28 and 35 ) . Our observations of actin incorporation at pointed ends and the rapid FRAP of GFP – Tmod indicate that Tmod capping in vivo is transient rather than tight . This was unexpected from previous observations that rho - actin did not incorporate at thin filament pointed ends in isolated myofibrils 26 , 27 and from tight binding of Tmod to tropomyosin - coated actin filaments in vitro 17 , 24 . There are several possible mechanisms by which Tmod capping might be downregulated in muscle and might lead to dynamic , transient capping in vivo . One possibility is that Tmod might not bind to tropomyosin at the extreme ends of the thin filaments , thereby low - ering the affinity of thin filament capping in vivo to that of pure actin filaments measured in vitro ( K d = 0 . 2 m M ) 17 , 24 . Alternatively , the movement of tropomyosin on actin ( for example during thin filament activation ) could transiently decrease Tmod affinity dur - ing contraction 1 . Finally , in view of these ideas , it is significant that newly synthesized tropomyosin is incorporated preferentially at or near the pointed ends of the thin filaments in cultured adult cardiac myocytes 35 . We suggest that Tmod dynamics and tropomyosin exchange at the pointed ends might be mutually dependent processes and that the entire structure of the thin filament pointed Table 3 Quantification of phallotoxin staining and filament lengths analysed by deconvolution method ( A , B , C ) or by manual measurements ( D ) Experiment Treatment Phallotoxin length Phallotoxin Z / U ratio Correlation coefficient N Cells A Non - injected 0 . 78 ± 0 . 07 0 . 91± 0 . 35 0 . 97 ± 0 . 01 37 9 Microinjected 0 . 80 ± 0 . 05 0 . 90 ± 0 . 31 0 . 96 ± 0 . 03 32 6 B 0 . 2 % DMSO 0 . 80 ± 0 . 06 1 . 25 ± 0 . 48 0 . 95 ± 0 . 04 31 4 50 nM CytoD 0 . 80 ± 0 . 04 2 . 25 ± 1 . 04 * * 0 . 97 ± 0 . 02 9 2 200 nM CytoD 0 . 81 ± 0 . 05 2 . 35 ± 0 . 36 * * 0 . 97 ± 0 . 02 28 5 C Untransfected 0 . 81 ± 0 . 04 1 . 50 ± 0 . 67 0 . 99 ± 0 . 01 11 5 GFP – Tmod 0 . 76 ± 0 . 04 * * 1 . 51 ± 0 . 63 0 . 99 ± 0 . 01 8 6 D Untransfected 0 . 78 ± 0 . 08 – – 1021 70 GFP 0 . 76 ± 0 . 07 – – 639 45 Comb . control 0 . 77 ± 0 . 08 – – 1660 115 GFP – Tmod 0 . 70 ± 0 . 08 * * – – 985 55 A , Control non - injected and rho - actin microinjected cells ; B , control cells treated with CytoD or DMSO ; C , D , untransfected cells , GFP - expressing cells or GFP – Tmod - overexpressing cells .

Similarly , the incorporation of rho - actin at thin filament barbed ends in vivo suggests that CapZ is also dynamic and transiently caps thin filament barbed ends in vivo . The affinity of capping protein ( the non - muscle isoform of CapZ ) has been estimated at ~ 100 nM in vivo from the quantification of free barbed ends in Dictyostelium as a function of capping protein levels 36 . Furthermore , labelled actin has been observed to incorporate at sites containing GFP - cap - ping protein in saponin - permeabilized fibroblasts , which is also consistent with transient capping 13 . The affinity of CapZ for barbed ends might be decreased in striated muscle by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which markedly increases the off - rate of CapZ from actin filament barbed ends in vitro 23 . Interestingly , the ability to regulate filament capping through modulation of the capping protein itself ( CapZ for exam - ple ) or through changes in the structure of filament ends ( Tmod for example ) would provide two distinct mechanisms that cells might use to regulate filament stability and organization . Our data suggest that actin dynamics at thin filament ends in cardiac myocytes is comparable to actin dynamics in relatively sta - ble actin filament structures in other cells . The time for complete FRAP for GFP – Tmod ( 10 – 15 min ) is similar to that for labelled actin in stress fibres , which takes place within 8 min ( ref . 11 ) , and in filopodia , which takes place within 20 min ( ref . 37 ) . These rates con - trast with the extremely rapid dynamics ( seconds ) observed for the transient actin filament networks in lamellae 5 , 9 , 38 or in Listeria comet tails 39 . Interestingly , the pointed ends might be the most dynamic region of the thin filaments in muscle , because more rho - actin was incorporated at thin filament pointed ends than at barbed ends . This could result from Tmod having a faster off - rate than that of CapZ in vivo . Nevertheless , despite relatively rapid dynamics at thin filament ends , the turnover of the entire thin filament is likely to be very slow ( that is , the middle of the thin filament is likely to be extremely stable ) . Distinct sites of rho - actin incorporation at both ends of the thin filaments persisted for several hours after microin - jection ( data not shown ) and the half - time of FRAP for actin in myofibrils has been reported to be 2 h ( ref . 40 ) , which might repre - sent turnover along the entire thin filament as opposed to the ends . How does Tmod regulate thin filament length ? Shorter fila - ments resulting from the overexpression of GFP – Tmod might result if excess Tmod inhibits re - polymerization more effectively than depolymerization ( Fig . 5b ) . This idea is suggested by the abil - ity of high concentrations of Tmod to decrease the affinity of monomers for pointed ends by transiently binding and converting all ends from ADP - P i to ADP ends , thus increasing the critical con - centration of pointed ends and leading to monomer dissociation and filament shortening 24 . Experiments testing whether Tmod overexpression increases the actin monomer concentration in myocytes are in progress . Our results here complement previous studies that showed that inhibition of Tmod capping resulted in inappropriate filament elongation from pointed ends 21 and provide a mechanistic explanation of how Tmod overexpression in rat car - diac myocytes 20 and in mouse hearts 22 led to the shortening and disassembly of thin filaments . It has been proposed that thin filament lengths are specified during myofibrillogenesis by an initial process of elongation and / or shortening in which caps are either not present or are dynamic , fol - lowed by a subsequent step of tight capping to maintain length 1 , 2 , 21 , 26 , 27 , 41 , 42 . However , our data indicate that there might not be distinct processes for specification and maintenance of length . First , the caps remain dynamic even in fully assembled , contractile myofibrils . Second , a ruler protein such as nebulin does not seem to promote tight capping and prevent actin dynamics at pointed ends , because actin incorporates at both thin filament ends in skeletal myotubes . Last , inhibition of monomer dynamics at pointed ends re - specifies the thin filaments to a new , shorter length but does not lead to filaments of variable lengths , that is , length mis - regulation . We propose that the specification of thin filament lengths in cardiac myocytes is an ongoing process accomplished via the coor - dination of multiple actin - binding proteins that regulate pointed - end dynamics , including monomer binding proteins , pointed - end - capping proteins and filament - binding proteins 1 . Thus , the particu - lar lengths of thin filaments would be a consequence of the avail - ability of actin monomers and their affinity for pointed ends . Continuing balanced actin assembly and disassembly at pointed fil - ament ends might be characteristic of actin filament structures , such as brush border microvilli , stereocilia and striated muscle sarcom - eres , which do not turn over rapidly and whose filament lengths and overall stability must both be maintained . In addition to these actin structures with clearly defined lengths , actin incorporation at point - ed ends might also be important for the stability and length of fila - ments in less organized cytoskeletal structures , such as contractile actin filament bundles in smooth muscle 43 , as well as stress fibres , graded polarity bundles and actin networks at leading edges in non - muscle cells 11 , 12 , 44 . The recent identification of a novel Tmod isoform expressed in non - muscle cells ( U - Tmod , Tmod 3 ) 45 , 46 further sug - gests that the regulation of actin filament dynamics at pointed ends by Tmod might be important in the regulation and function of actin filament length in these or other structures . Methods Actin purification and labelling . Rho - actin was prepared from purified rabbit skeletal actin and labelled on Cys374 as described previ - ously 47 . The dye : protein ratio was 0 . 7mol rhodamine per mol actin . Aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen at 3 . 7mgml - 1 in actin injection buffer ( 2mM PIPES , pH7 . 0 , 50 m M MgCl 2 , 100 m M ATP , 100 m M dithiothreitol ) . Cell culture , microinjection and transfection . Chick cardiac myocytes and chick skeletal myoblasts were isolated from 6 - day and 12 - day embryos , respectively , by standard methods 42 , 48 . Cardiac myocytes were plated on glass coverslips at 10 5 cellsml - 1 and were microinjected between days 6 and 10 , when they were beating spontaneously . Skeletal myoblasts were microinjected at 6 – 8d after plating , when striated myofibrils had assembled and myotubes had begun to twitch . For microinjection , actin was diluted 1 : 3 in actin injection buffer and injected into cells with an Eppendorf microinjection system ( models 5246 and 5171 ) on an Axiovert inverted microscope ( Zeiss ) . Fresh medium supplemented with 20mM HEPES pH7 . 4 was added before microinjection . Cells were fixed ~ 1h after microinjection and stained either with primary antibodies against Tmod ( mAb 95 ) or a - actinin ( EA53 ; Sigma ) followed by fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson ) , or with 4 , 4 - difluoro - 4 - bora - 3a , 4a - diaza - s - indacene ( BODIPY ) - FL phallacidin ( Molecular Probes ) 21 , 42 , 48 . For experiments with cytoD , medium containing a 1 : 500 dilution of DMSO , 25 m M CytoD in DMSO , or 100 m M CytoD in DMSO was added 20min before microinjection . For transfection , cardiac myocytes were plated at a density of 10 6 cells onto 35 - mm plastic dishes containing 12 - mm round coverslips . The next day , cells were transfected with GFP – Tmod plasmid or GFP plasmid by using Cytofectine ( Bio - Rad ) . After a further 5 or 6d , transfected cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS and stained with rhodamine – phalloidin ( Sigma ) 21 . Striated myofibrils could not be observed in some cells ( 1 – 2 % ) expressing high levels of GFP – Tmod ; they were not analysed . For photobleaching , cells were transfected on 24 . 5 - mm round coverslips and placed into a live - cell chamber containing cardiac cell culture medium without phenol red and supplemented with 10mM HEPES pH7 . 4 and oxyrase ( Oxyrase , Mansfield , Ohio ) . Photobleaching experiments were performed on beating cardiac myocytes with a Bio - Rad 1024 confocal with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope and a 63 · Plan - Apochromat oil - immersion objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) . The resultant pixel size was 0 . 099 m m . An 18 - m m square area was photobleached at 100 % laser power by scanning at slow speed five or six times , or until fluorescence was not detected . Prebleach and recovery images were taken at 3 – 10 % laser power at normal scan speed . About 30s was required to collect the first image after photobleach - ing ( Fig . 5 , bleach ) . The GFP – Tmod plasmid was constructed by Eco RI digestion of the complementary DNA encoding full - length chicken E - Tmod 49 , the endogenous isoform in chick cardiac myocytes 42 , 50 , and ligation into the Eco RI site at the multiple cloning site of pEGFP - C3 ( Clontech ) . This created an in - frame fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) to the amino terminus of E - Tmod with a short linker . Microscopy and image analysis . Fixed and living cells were observed with a 63 · Plan - Apochromat oil - immersion objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) on either a Zeiss Axiovert or an Axioskop equipped with a cooled charge - coupled - device camera ( with either a KAF1400 or a Y1300 Interline chip ( Princeton Instruments ) ) . Pixel - to - pixel dis - tances were determined with a micrometer to be 0 . 107 m m for the Axiovert and 0 . 103 m m for the Axioskop . Adobe Photoshop ( version 5 ) was used for the final presentation of images . Digital images of myofibrils were quantified with IP Lab ( Scanalytics Inc . ) and Excel ( Microsoft ) ( R . L . and V . M . F . , unpublished data ) . For each myofibril , the minimum intensity of regions above and below the myofibril ( each 8 – 12 pixels wide ) was subtracted from the median intensity across the myofibril ( 4 – 10 pixels wide ) to generate myofibril line scans , which included 5 – 14 sarcomeres ( 81 – 251 pixels ) . To determine the distribution of rho - actin and phallacidin within the sarcomeres , the line scans were analysed by distributed deconvolution , a novel two - step deconvolution algorithm ( Supplementary Information text and figure S1 ) . Distributed deconvolution describes a myofibril line scan with three distinct distribution functions : the gaussian distribution , the Z - line distribution and the thin filament distribution . The gaussian distribution function represents a one - dimensional point spread function that accounts for the blurring of the fluorescence in the microscope and the focus of © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 JUNE 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 551 the myofibril image ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . The Z - line distribution function describes the location and relative intensities of Z - lines along the myofibril and accounts for the effects due to variation in sarcomere length and myofibril thickness ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . The thin filament distribution function describes the location and relative intensities of rho - actin and phal - lacidin within the thin filament ( Supplementary Information , Figs S1b , S2 ) . The parameter values that determine the gaussian , Z - line and thin filament distribution functions were optimized by minimizing the difference between the observed and modelled intensities along the myofibril line scan with the Solver add - in for Excel . The average correlation coefficients between the observed and modelled inten - sities were greater than 0 . 9 and are given in Tables2 and 3 . The rho - actin thin filament distribution function was modelled as incorporation at barbed and pointed ends ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) , on the basis of a visual inspection of images ( for example , Fig . 1a ) . Two parameters , the distance of the pointed - end peak from the Z - line ( rho - actin distance ) and the relative intensities at the barbed and pointed ends ( P / B ratio ) specify the rho - actin distribution function . The convolution of the rho - actin distribution function with the gaussian distri - bution function ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) yields the rho - actin profile ( Supplementary Information , Figs S1c , S2b ) . The phallacidin thin filament distribution function was modelled as a uni - form intensity along the length of the thin filaments with a variable intensity relative to the Z - line ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2c ) , on the basis of the distribution of actin within the sarcomere and the binding properties of phallacidin along thin filaments ( for example , Fig . 1a ) . Two parameters , the distance that the uniform intensity extends away from the Z - line ( phallacidin distance ) and the intensity at the Z - line relative to the uniform intensity ( Z / U ratio ) , specify the phallacidin distribution function . These two distribution functions use the minimal number of parameters required to be con - sistent with the images . The convolution of the phallacidin distribution function with the gaussian dis - tribution function ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) yields the phallacidin profile ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2d ) . In transfected cells , thin filament lengths were also estimated by manually measuring the breadth of phalloidin staining across each thin filament array ( pointed end to pointed end ) by using the measure - length function in IP Lab . Values were halved and converted to micrometres . This method permitted the rapid measurement of many phalloidin - stained bands in the entire population of transfected cells . Sarcomere lengths were measured similarly from Z - line to Z - line . Quantification is reported as averages with standard deviations . P values were determined with the Excel function for paired Student’s t - tests , assuming equal variances .

These tech - niques are related because convolution ( the reverse of deconvolu - tion ) is the product of two functions in Fourier space . Both decon - volution and Fourier analysis can be performed in one , two or three dimensions . We present here a brief summary of a new distributed deconvolution technique that we have developed to analyse fluo - rescence intensity and distribution patterns along striated myofib - rils . This technique will be presented in more detail ( R . L . and V . M . F . , unpublished data ) . Distributed deconvolution is a novel version of deconvolution that analyses one - dimensional intensity information from striated muscle myofibrils by using two steps of convolution to combine three separate functions ( Fig . S1 ) . The first function is a gaussian distribution function ( Fig . S1a ) , which simulates the one - dimen - sional spread of light from a point source in the microscope . The gaussian distribution function is similar to the PSF used in conven - tional deconvolution . The second function is a Z - line distribution function ( Fig . S1d ) , which accounts for the repetitive organization of myofibrils into sarcomeres . The third function is a thin - filament distribution function ( Fig . S1b ) , which describes the distribution of fluorescence within the thin filament array ( the repeating actin fil - ament structure in myofibrils ) . Multiple thin - filament distribution functions can be used to describe the fluorescence for several probes ; here we used two thin - filament distribution functions , one for rho - actin and one for phallacidin ( Fig . S2 ) . The gaussian , thin - filament and Z - line distribution functions are specified by several parameters , which are optimized for each myofibril analysed with the Solver add - in feature of Microsoft Excel . The distributed deconvolution procedure is powerful because it relies on only a relatively few simple assumptions . First , the spread of light is assumed to be uniform along a myofibril . In general , this is true as long as the entire myofibril remains in one plane of focus , thus allowing only one gaussian distribution function to be used for a particular myofibril . Second , the spread of light in a micro - scope is assumed to be gaussian , which is easily described by one parameter , gaussian width , corresponding to the standard devia - tion of a normal distribution ( Fig . S1a ) . A gaussian distribution is a good first estimate because it represents the blurring of light from spherical aberration . The third assumption is that each Z - line behaves independently of all others . Thus , two parameters , Z - line position and Z - line weight , are used to describe the location and intensity of each Z - line ( Fig . S1d ) . This allows adjacent sarcomeres within the same myofibril to have different lengths , as is observed in living and fixed cells . Furthermore , these parameters allow a myofibril to vary in brightness along its length , which occurs owing to changes in myofibril thickness in cells . The fourth assumption of distributed deconvolution is that the fluorescence distribution is identical for all of the thin filament arrays within a myofibril . This would be consistent with the repetitive organization of actin fila - ments within striated myofibrils . However , this assumption can be tested directly owing to the unique features of the rho - actin distri - bution function ( Fig . S2a ) . The rho - actin thin - filament distribution function consists of three symmetrical incorporation sites ( Fig . S2a ) that are related by two parameters ( rho - actin distance and P / B ratio ) . The correspon - ding rho - actin profile ( after convolution with the gaussian distri - bution ) consists of three peaks of intensity with the middle peak located at the Z - line and two flanking peaks located at the pointed ends of the thin filaments . For a given myofibril , a single rho - actin profile is repeated along the length of the myofibril as determined by the Z - line distribution ( Fig . S3a , filled circles ) . Each profile is scaled according to the Z - line weight parameters ; however , the rela - tionship between the peaks within a profile remains identical . Thus , the distance between the flanking and centre peaks is determined by the rho - actin distance parameter , and their relative height ( or area ) is determined by the P / B ratio parameter ( as in Fig . S2a , b ) . To determine whether restricting these parameters for each pro - file is valid , we allowed the three peaks to vary in relative distance and size from each other by using a rho - actin profile that consisted of a single peak ( Fig . S3b ) . A group of three peaks would still cor - respond to the incorporation pattern of rho - actin at Z - lines ( Z ) and pointed ends ( P ) ; however , all three peaks were allowed to behave independently of each other ( that is , the location and inten - sity of each peak was determined by using independent parame - ters ) . When the parameters are determined for the best fit , the posi - tion of each peak can be determined as illustrated in Fig . S3b ( filled circles ) . In Fig . S3c , the two methods are compared after the best fit of the model to the line scan has been obtained . The correlation coef - ficient is slightly lower for the 3 - peak profile and the error is slight - ly higher ; however , this is not surprising because the 3 - peak profile uses less parameters . For the 3 - peak profile , the peaks of incorpo - ration at the pointed ends were 0 . 684 m m apart and the P / B ratio was 1 . 68 . For the 1 - peak profile , the centre - to - centre distance between each peak at the pointed end and the nearest Z - line peak was 0 . 682 ± 0 . 034 m m and the average P / B ratio was 1 . 65 ± 0 . 32 . Importantly , the values for rho - actin distance and P / B ratio are identical to the average determined by the 1 - peak profile . The small standard deviation for rho - actin distance and P / B ratio determined with the 1 - peak profile indicated that rho - actin was incorporated in a uniform repeating pattern at Z - lines and at pointed ends along the myofibril . Furthermore , the rho - actin distance and P / B ratio parameters determined with the 1 - peak profile varied the most when the pointed ends were located within 0 . 2 m m of each other and were not resolved as two separate peaks ( data not shown ) . This source of variation is evident when the P / B ratio is determined per sarcomere by the total fluorescence at pointed ends relative to the total fluorescence at Z - lines ( 1 . 64 ± 0 . 10 ) ( Fig . S3c , average 1 - peak ) . This threefold decrease in the standard deviation of the P / B ratio further supports the uniformity of rho - actin incorporation site along a myofibril . In sum , this analysis demonstrates the validity of modelling rho - actin incorporation sites into striated myofibrils by distributed deconvolution . 1 . Scalettar , B . A . , Swedlow , J .
