Mondino , Mondino - Tor Vergata , Santa Lucia Center for Experimental Neurobiology , 00133 Rome , Italy Several G protein - coupled receptors function within lipid rafts plasma membrane microdomains , which may be important in limiting signal transduction . Here we show that treatment of rat C6 glioma cells with the raft disruptor methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin ( MCD ) doubles the binding efficiency ( i . e . the ratio between maximum binding and dissociation constant ) of type - 1 cannabi - noid receptors ( CB1R ) , which belong to the rhodopsin family of G protein - coupled receptors . In parallel , acti - vation of CB1R by the endogenous agonist anandamide ( AEA ) leads to (cid:1) 3 - fold higher [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S binding in MCD - treated cells than in controls , and CB1R - depend - ent signaling via adenylate cyclase , and p42 / p44 MAPK is almost doubled by MCD . Unlike CB1R , the other AEA - binding receptor TRPV1 , the AEA synthetase NAPE - PLD , and the AEA hydrolase FAAH are not modulated by MCD , whereas the activity of the AEA membrane transporter ( AMT ) is reduced to (cid:1) 50 % of the controls . We also show that MCD reduces dose - dependently AEA - induced apoptosis in C6 cells but not in human CHP100 neuroblastoma cells , which mirror the endocannabinoid system of C6 cells but are devoid of CB1R . MCD reduces also cytochrome c release from mitochondria of C6 cells , and this effect is CB1R - dependent and partly mediated by activation of p42 / p44 MAPK . Altogether , the present data suggest that lipid rafts control CB1R binding and signaling , and that CB1R activation underlies the pro - tective effect of MCD against apoptosis . Anandamide ( arachidonoylethanolamide , AEA ) 1 belongs to a group of endogenous lipids , which include amides , esters , and ethers of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids , collectively termed endocannabinoids ( 1 , 2 ) . It binds to type - 1 and type - 2 cannabinoid receptors ( CB1R and CB2R ) , thus playing many actions in the central nervous system ( 3 ) and in the periphery ( 4 ) . The activities of AEA at CB receptors are terminated by cellular uptake through an AEA membrane transporter ( AMT ) ( 5 ) , followed by hydrolysis to ethanolamine and arachidonic acid by the fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) ( 6 , 7 ) . The checkpoint in AEA synthesis is the N - acyl - phosphatidylethano - lamines ( NAPE ) - hydrolyzing phospholipase D ( NAPE - PLD ) , which releases on demand AEA from membrane NAPEs ( 8 ) . Together with AEA and congeners like 2 - arachidonoylglyc - erol ( 2 - AG ) , N - arachidonoyldopamine , noladin ether , and vi - rodhamine , these proteins form the endocannabinoid system ( 2 ) . One activity of AEA that has attracted growing interest is its ability to induce programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) in neuronal and peripheral cells ( 9 ) , with therapeutic potential in cancer ( 10 ) and neurodegenerative diseases ( 11 – 14 ) . In a previous study we have shown that the pro - apoptotic activity of AEA occurs through activation of type 1 vanilloid receptors ( now called transient receptor potential channel vanilloid receptor subunit 1 , TRPV1 ) , which are six transmembrane - spanning proteins with intracel - lular N and C termini ( 15 ) . In fact , we have shown that AEA is a physiological agonist of TRPV1 ( 16 ) , and thus can be also consid - ered a true endovanilloid ( 17 ) . Instead , activation of CB1R pro - tects cells against AEA - induced apoptosis , suggesting that va - nilloid and cannabinoid receptors regulate in opposite ways the apoptotic potential of AEA ( 18 – 20 ) . In the last few years the concept of a protective role of CB receptors against ( endo ) cannabinoid - induced apoptosis has been extended to several cell types , from neuronal and immune cells to endothelial cells and astrocytes ( reviewed in Refs . 9 and 10 ) . Recently , two reports from Maruyama’s group have shown that methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin ( MCD ) blocks apoptosis induced in vitro by AEA in glioma cells ( 21 ) and hepatocytes ( 22 ) . MCD is a membrane cholesterol depletor ( 23 ) , and is widely used to disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts , i . e . subdomains of the plasma mem - brane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glyco - sphingolipids ( 24 – 26 ) . Thus , a novel role for membrane lipid rafts in AEA - induced apoptosis was suggested ( 21 , 22 ) . In this line , there is growing evidence that G protein - coupled receptors * This study was supported in part by Ministero dell’Istruzione , dell’Universita ` e della Ricerca ( COFIN 2003 , to M .

CB1R belongs to the rhodopsin family of GPCR ( 27 , 28 ) , therefore we decided to investigate the effect of MCD on the proteins of the endocannabinoid system , and the implications for AEA - induced apoptosis . We have chosen rat C6 glioma cells , because they have a well characterized endocannabinoid sys - tem ( 18 , 21 , 29 ) , and undergo AEA - induced apoptosis mediated by TRPV1 and counteracted by CB1R ( 18 , 19 ) . We extended the study to human CHP100 neuroblastoma cells , which have the same ability as C6 cells to metabolize AEA , but are devoid of CB1R and hence are more sensitive to the pro - apoptotic activ - ity of AEA ( 18 ) . We did not further extend this study to 2 - AG and the enzymes that degrade ( 30 ) and synthesize it ( 31 ) , because 2 - AG does not have pro - apoptotic activity toward C6 cells or CHP100 cells ( 18 , 21 ) , in keeping with the observation that it does not activate TRPV1 receptors ( 17 ) , or at least has a much lower potency than AEA ( 32 ) . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials— Chemicals were of the purest analytical grade . AEA , cholesterol , MCD , cytochrome c , pertussis toxin ( PTX ) , resinferatoxin ( RTX ) , GTP (cid:2) S , and wortmannin were from Sigma . Methyl - arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate ( MAFP ) was from Cayman Chemicals ( Ann Arbor , MI ) , capsazepine ( N - [ 2 - ( 4 - chlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrahydro - 7 , 8 - dihydroxy - 2H - 2 - benzazepine - 2 - carbothioamide , CPZ ) was from Calbio - chem , VDM11 was from Tocris - Cookson ( Bristol , UK ) , and 2 (cid:2) - amino - 3 (cid:2) - methoxyflavone ( PD98059 ) was from Alexis Corporation ( La¨ufelfingen , Switzerland ) . [ 3 H ] AEA ( 223 Ci / mmol ) , [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 ( 126 Ci / mmol ) , [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S ( 1250 Ci / mmol ) and [ 3 H ] RTX ( 43 Ci / mmol ) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences ( Boston , MA ) . N - [ 3 H ] Arachidonoyl - phosphatidylethanolamine ( [ 3 H ] NArPE , 200 Ci / mmol ) was from ARC ( St . Louis , MO ) . Adenosine 5 (cid:2) - [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] triphosphate ( 3000 Ci / mmol ) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences , and N - piperidino - 5 - ( 4 - chlorophenyl ) - 1 - ( 2 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) - 4 - methyl - 3 - pyrazole carboxamide ( SR141716 ) was a kind gift of Sanofi - Synthelabo Recherche ( Montpel - lier , France ) . 6 - Dodecanoyl - 2 - dimethylamino - naphthalene ( laurdan ) was from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Rabbit anti - CB1R polyclonal antibodies were from Cayman Chemicals ( Ann Arbor , MI ) , and mouse anti - cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies ( clone 7H8 . 2C12 ) were from BD PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) . Goat anti - rabbit or anti - mouse alka - line phosphatase conjugates ( GAR - AP or GAM - AP , respectively ) were purchased from Bio - Rad ( 33 ) . Cell Culture and Treatment and Determination of Apoptosis— Rat C6 glioma cells were cultured in Ham’s F - 12 medium ( Flow Laboratories Ltd . , Herts , UK ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum as described ( 18 ) . Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 and were fed every 3 – 4 days . Adherent human CHP100 neuroblas - toma cells were cultured as previously reported ( 18 ) in a 1 : 1 mixture of MEM ( Eagle’s minimal essential medium plus Earle’s salts ) and Ham’s F - 12 media ( Flow Laboratories Ltd . ) , supplemented with 15 % heat - inac - tivated fetal bovine serum , sodium bicarbonate ( 1 . 2 g / liter ) , 15 m M Hepes buffer , 2 m M L - glutamine , and 1 % non - essential aminoacids . CHP100 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere , and were trypsinized ( 0 . 05 % trypsin , 0 . 02 % EDTA ) before treatment . Cholesterol depletion was performed by preincubating C6 cells or CHP100 cells for 30 min at 37 °C with the indicated amounts of MCD , which removes cholesterol from the plasma membranes ( 21 , 24 , 34 , 35 ) . After MCD pretreatment , cells were washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and then were treated with AEA ( or vehicle in the controls ) as detailed below . In some experiments , cholesterol repletion was achieved by treating C6 cells with 5 m M MCD , washing in PBS , and then incubating for 15 min at 37 °C with 5 m M cholesterol - MCD complexes ( 36 ) . Synthesis of the cholesterol - MCD com - plexes was carried out as reported ( 37 ) . Cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue dye exclusion . Apoptosis was estimated 48 h after treatment with AEA ( or vehicle in the controls ) ( 18 ) , by using the cell death detection ELISA kit ( Roche Applied Science ) , based on the evaluation of DNA fragmentation by an immunoassay for histone - associated DNA fragments in the cell cyto - plasm ( 18 ) . This method has been recently validated for C6 cells and CHP100 cells by comparison with cytofluorimetric analysis , performed in a FACScalibur Flow Cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) ( 18 ) . This latter technique quantifies apoptotic bodies formation in dead cells by stain - ing with propidium iodide ( 50 (cid:3) g / ml ) . Both C6 and CHP100 control cells contained less than 4 . 0 (cid:3) 1 . 0 apoptotic bodies every 100 cells analyzed ( 18 ) . Cholesterol Quantitation and Analysis of Cell Membrane Fluidity— Membrane lipids were extracted from C6 cells or CHP100 cells ( 5 (cid:4) 10 6 per test ) and cholesterol content was measured by means of cholesterol oxidase ( kit from Roche Applied Science ) , as previously described ( 38 ) . Membrane fluidity of the cells was determined by means of the fluores - cent probe laurdan , as already described ( 38 ) . Membrane fluidity is inversely proportional to the ratio of laurdan fluorescence at 440 nm versus that at 490 nm ( F 440 / F 490 ) : the higher the ratio , the lower the fluidity ( 39 ) . Receptor Binding Assays and AEA - stimulated [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S Binding— Membrane fractions were prepared from C6 cells ( 200 (cid:4) 10 6 test ) , that had been previously treated with MCD as described above , and were used to perform direct binding experiments of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 by rapid filtration assays ( 18 ) . Binding data were elaborated through nonlinear regression analysis , using the Prism 3 program ( GraphPAD Software for Science , San Diego , CA ) , in order to calculate maximum binding ( B max ) and dissociation constant ( K d ) of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 . Saturation bind - ing of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 was further analyzed through Scatchard plots . Direct binding of [ 3 H ] RTX was evaluated by rapid filtration assays , performed as reported ( 40 ) , and B max and K d values were calculated as described above for [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 . In all binding experiments , nonspe - cific binding was determined in the presence of 1 (cid:3) M cold agonist ( 18 , 40 ) . Western blot analysis of CB1R in the same membrane preparations ( 50 (cid:3) g / lane ) used in binding assays was performed by 12 % SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions , followed by electroblotting onto 0 . 45 (cid:3) m nitrocellulose filters ( Bio - Rad ) ( 18 ) . Rabbit anti - CB1R antibodies ( di - luted 1 : 250 ) were used as first antibody , and goat anti - rabbit immuno - globulins conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( GAR - AP ) as second antibody ( at 1 : 2000 dilution ) ( 18 ) . AEA - stimulated [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S binding was determined on membrane fractions ( 18 ) essentially as described ( 41 ) . Membrane preparations were pre - incubated in 4 milliunits / ml adenosine deaminase ( 183 units / mg of protein , Sigma ) for 10 min at 30 °C . The binding of [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S stimulated by various amounts of AEA was assayed in the presence of 30 (cid:3) M GDP , 0 . 1 n M [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S , 50 (cid:3) g of protein and assay buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 3 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA ) in a final volume of 1 ml . Nonspecific binding was determined in the absence of agonist and in the presence of 10 (cid:3) M unlabeled GTP (cid:2) S ( 41 ) . Determination of AEA Uptake , Synthesis , and Hydrolysis— The ac - tivity of the AMT in C6 cells was measured as described ( 42 ) . Cells ( 2 (cid:4) 10 6 / test ) were incubated for 15 min , at 37 °C or 4 °C , with 400 n M [ 3 H ] AEA , then they were washed three times in 2 ml of PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin and were finally resuspended in 200 (cid:3) l of PBS . Membrane lipids were then extracted ( 42 ) , resuspended in 0 . 5 ml of methanol , mixed with 3 . 5 ml Sigma - Fluor liquid scintillation mixture for non - aqueous samples ( Sigma ) , and radioactivity was measured in a LKB1214 Rackbeta scintillation counter ( Amersham Biosciences ) . To discriminate non - carrier - mediated from carrier - mediated transport of AEA through cell membranes , [ 3 H ] AEA uptake at 4 °C was subtracted from that at 37 °C ( 42 ) . Michaelis - Menten constant ( K m ) and maximum velocity ( V max ) of the uptake of [ 3 H ] AEA ( 0 – 800 n M range ) by AMT in C6 cells were determined by nonlinear regression analysis as reported ( 42 ) . AMT activity was expressed as pmol of AEA taken up per min per mg of protein . The synthesis of [ 3 H ] AEA through the activity of NAPE - PLD ( EC 3 . 1 . 4 . 4 ) was assayed in C6 cell homogenates ( 50 (cid:3) g / test ) , using 100 (cid:3) M [ 3 H ] NArPE as reported ( 8 ) . NAPE - PLD activity was expressed as pmol of [ 3 H ] AEA released per min per mg of protein . The hydrolysis of [ 3 H ] AEA by the fatty acid amide hydrolase ( EC 3 . 5 . 1 . 4 ; FAAH ) activity was assayed in C6 cell extracts ( 20 (cid:3) g / test ) by measuring the release of [ 3 H ] arachidonic acid from 10 (cid:3) M [ 3 H ] AEA at pH 9 . 0 , using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography ( 18 ) . FAAH activity was expressed as pmol arachidonate released per min per mg of protein . Other Enzymatic Assays— C6 cells ( 5 (cid:4) 10 6 / test ) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with AEA and related compounds , then they were washed , homogenized and subjected to enzymatic assays . Forskolin ( 1 (cid:3) M ) - stimulated adenylate cyclase ( EC 4 . 6 . 1 . 1 ; AC ) activity was deter - mined according to the amount of cAMP ( 43 ) , detected in cell extracts with the cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit , as detailed below . AC activity was expressed as pmol cAMP per min per mg of protein . The activity of p42 / p44 MAPK ( EC 2 . 7 . 1 . 37 ) was assayed in cell extracts by the phos - phorylation of MAPK - specific peptide substrate at 30 °C with adenosine 5 (cid:2) - [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] triphosphate ( 44 ) , using the Biotrak MAPK enzyme assay system ( Amersham Biosciences ) . MAPK activity was expressed as pmol of phosphate per min per mg of protein . The effect of pertussis toxin ( PTX ) on enzymatic activities was determined by preincubating C6 cells for 3 h at 37 °C with 5 (cid:3) g / ml PTX before addition of AEA , or vehicle in control experiments ( 43 , 44 ) .

Cyclic AMP levels in acetylated cell extracts were determined by the Cayman Chemical cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay kit ( Alexis Corpo - ration , La¨ufelfingen , Switzerland ) , as reported ( 42 ) . Cyclic AMP in the extracts was within the linearity range of the method , calibrated with acetylated cAMP as suggested by the manufacturer . The amount of cytochrome c released into the cytosol of C6 cells or CHP100 cells ( 25 (cid:4) 10 6 cells / test ) 8 h after treatment with AEA ( 18 ) was quantified by ELISA , previously validated for both cell lines by Western blot analysis ( 18 ) . Cell extracts ( 25 (cid:3) g / well ) were reacted with anti - cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies , diluted 1 : 250 , and GAM - AP as sec - ond antibody at 1 : 2000 dilution . Color development of the alkaline phos - phatase reaction was recorded at 405 nm , using p - nitrophenylphosphate as substrate ( 18 ) . The absorbance values of the unknown samples were within the linearity range of the ELISA test , assessed by calibration curves with known amounts of cytochrome c ( in the range 0 – 500 ng / well ) . Statistical Analysis— Data reported in this study are the means (cid:3) S . D . of at least three independent experiments , each performed in duplicate . Statistical analysis was performed by the nonparametric Mann - Whitney U test , elaborating experimental data by means of the InStat 3 program ( GraphPAD Software for Science ) . RESULTS Effect of MCD on CB1 Receptors and TRPV1 Receptors— Treatment of rat C6 glioma cells with MCD caused a dose - de - pendent increase in the binding of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 , a CB1R and CB2R agonist ( 45 ) . C6 cells express type - 1 CB receptors ( 18 , 21 ) , and consistently [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 binding was fully displaced by 0 . 1 (cid:3) M SR141716 ( Fig . 1 A ) , a selective CB1R antagonist ( 45 ) . The increase in CB1R binding reached statistical significance at 1 m M MCD , and a maximum of (cid:1) 250 % of the control value at a dose of 2 . 5 m M ( Fig . 1 A ) . Therefore , the latter concentration was used to further investigate the effect of MCD . Nonlinear regression analysis of saturation curves like that shown in Fig . 1 B allowed to calculate the constants of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 binding reported in Table I , demonstrating that MCD doubled B max without significantly affecting K d values . Overall , MCD dou - bled the binding efficiency of CB1R , defined as the B max / K d ratio by analogy with the catalytic efficiency ( V max / K m ) of en - zymes . These calculations were further confirmed by Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 to control ( Fig . 1 C ) or MCD - treated cells ( Fig . 1 D ) , that yielded B max F IG . 1 . Effect of MCD on CB1 receptors in C6 cells . A , binding of 400 p M [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 to C6 cells pretreated for 30 min with various amounts of MCD in the absence or in the presence of the CB1R antagonist SR141716 ( 0 . 1 (cid:3) M ) . Values were expressed as percentage of the untreated control ( 100 % (cid:5) 600 (cid:3) 70 fmol / mg of protein ) . Also the binding of 400 p M [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 to C6 cells pretreated with 5 m M MCD and then with 5 m M cholesterol - MCD complexes ( 5 (cid:6) Chol ) is shown . B , saturation curves of the binding of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 to C6 cells , untreated or pretreated with 2 . 5 m M MCD for 30 min . Inset , Western blot analysis of CB1R in C6 cell membrane fractions ( 25 (cid:3) g / lane ) . The expected molecular size of CB1R is shown on the right side . Reported blot is representative of triplicate experiments . Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 to control ( C ) and MCD - treated ( D ) cells shown in B . All the data points fitted a linear relationship ( r (cid:5) 0 . 993 or 0 . 982 , for control or MCD - treated cells , respectively ) from which B max and K d values were calculated ( see “Results” ) . In A , * denotes p (cid:7) 0 . 01 compared with controls untreated with MCD ; # denotes p (cid:7) 0 . 01 compared with cells treated with 5 m M MCD ; p (cid:8) 0 . 05 in all other cases . Lipid Rafts , Endocannabinoids , and Apoptosis 12214 b y on A ugu s t 19 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m values of 1889 fmol / mg of protein and 4593 fmol / mg of protein , and K d values of 663 p M and 868 p M , for control or MCD - treated cells respectively . Thus , B max / K d ratios of 2 . 85 and 5 . 29 could be calculated for control and MCD - treated cells respectively , in keeping with the values yielded by nonlinear regression anal - ysis ( Table I ) . Incidentally , B max and K d values of CB1R in C6 cells are close to those reported for the same receptor from other sources ( 45 ) . In addition , the saturation binding data of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 were not better fitted by a two - site - binding model ( not shown ) . CB1R can undergo rapid ( within minutes ) internalization and recycling into the plasma membrane ( 46 , 47 ) . In order to ascertain whether MCD could alter CB1 receptors recruitment in plasma membranes of C6 cells , Western blot analysis was performed . The results demonstrated that membrane levels of CB1R were identical in C6 cells untreated or treated with 2 . 5 m M MCD ( Fig . 1 B , inset ) , ruling out that MCD could increase the amount of CB1R present on the cell surface . Additionally , C6 cells that had been pretreated with 5 m M MCD and then with 5 m M cholesterol - MCD complexes showed the same bind - ing ability as untreated controls ( Fig . 1 A ) , suggesting that the effect of MCD was reversible . On the other hand binding of [ 3 H ] RTX , a selective TRPV1 agonist ( 16 , 40 ) , to C6 membranes was not affected by MCD at any dose ( Fig . 2 A ) . Yet , [ 3 H ] RTX binding was fully prevented by 1 (cid:3) M CPZ ( Fig . 2 A ) , a selective TRPV1 antagonist ( 16 , 40 ) . In keeping with these data , saturation curves of [ 3 H ] RTX binding ( Fig . 2 B ) were not significantly affected by MCD and yielded B max and K d values almost superimposable on the controls ( Table I ) , which are typical of TRPV1 receptors ( 40 , 48 ) . Effect of MCD on CB1 - dependent Signaling Pathways— The main signaling pathways triggered by agonist binding to CB1 receptors include inhibition of adenylate cyclase ( AC ) and stim - ulation of MAPK , both mediated by G i / o proteins ( for reviews see Refs . 27 and 28 ) . Here , pretreatment of C6 cells with MCD was found to enhance dose - dependently the binding of [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S stimulated by 1 (cid:3) M AEA , an effect fully prevented by 0 . 1 (cid:3) M SR141716 ( Fig . 3 A ) . Dose dependence of MCD - in - duced increase of agonist - stimulated [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S binding re - sembled that of [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 binding to C6 cells , yet the maximum reached at 2 . 5 m M MCD was higher for [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S than for [ 3 H ] CP55 . 940 binding ( (cid:1) 330 % versus (cid:1) 250 % of the controls , respectively ; compare Fig . 1 A and Fig . 3 A ) . In addi - tion , dose response curves demonstrated that [ 35 S ] GTP (cid:2) S bind - ing in C6 cells pretreated with 2 . 5 m M MCD was enhanced dose - dependently by the agonist , reaching a maximum at the saturating concentration of 1 (cid:3) M ( Fig . 3 B ) . Pretreatment with 2 . 5 m M MCD did not affect the basal activity of AC nor that of MAPK , but significantly potentiated the effect of 1 (cid:3) M AEA on these enzymes , inhibiting AC down to (cid:1) 20 % of the controls , and increasing MAPK up to (cid:1) 500 % ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . The activity of AC and MAPK in AEA - treated cells not previously incubated with MCD was (cid:1) 40 % and (cid:1) 300 % of the basal levels , respectively ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Additionally , the effects of 1 (cid:3) M AEA on AC and MAPK were abolished by 0 . 1 (cid:3) M SR141716 , or by 5 (cid:3) g / ml PTX , an inhibitor of G i / o proteins ( 43 , 44 ) ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Furthermore , dose response curves dem - onstrated that both AC activity and MAPK activity of C6 cells pretreated with 2 . 5 m M MCD were affected dose - dependently by agonist concentration , reaching a maximum at the saturat - ing concentration of 1 (cid:3) M ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Taken together , these findings suggest that the increased binding to CB1R in MCD - treated cells led to enhanced agonist - induced CB1R sig - naling through G i / o proteins . Effect of MCD on AEA Synthesis , Uptake , and Degrada - tion— We further investigated the effect of MCD on the other F IG . 2 . Effect of MCD on TRPV1 receptors in C6 cells . A , binding of 200 p M [ 3 H ] RTX to C6 cells pretreated for 30 min with various amounts of MCD , in the absence or in the presence of the TRPV1 antagonist CPZ ( 1 (cid:3) M ) . Values were expressed as percentage of the untreated control ( 100 % (cid:5) 120 (cid:3) 15 fmol / mg of protein ) .

MCD did not affect the activity of NAPE - PLD ( Fig . 5 A ) , which is the checkpoint in AEA synthesis ( 8 ) , whereas it reduced the activ - ity of the AMT ( Fig . 5 B ) without affecting that of the AEA - hydrolase FAAH ( Fig . 5 C ) . As expected , the activity of AMT and that of FAAH were fully inhibited by the corresponding selective inhibitors VDM11 ( 10 (cid:3) M ) and MAFP ( 100 n M ) ( 16 ) . The lack of specific inhibitors of NAPE - PLD did not allow to further extend the inhibition experiments . In addition , kinetic analysis of AMT in control C6 cells ( not shown ) yielded K m and V max values of 160 (cid:3) 18 n M and 45 (cid:3) 5 pmol / min per mg of protein respectively , in keeping with a previous report ( 18 ) . Interestingly , in C6 cells treated with 2 . 5 m M MCD the values of K m and V max of AMT were 140 (cid:3) 20 n M and 25 (cid:3) 3 pmol / min per mg of protein , respectively . Effect of MCD on Membrane Properties— In an attempt to clarify the mechanism of MCD effect , we measured the choles - terol content and membrane fluidity of C6 cells . MCD is a cholesterol depletor ( 23 ) , and indeed treatment with this com - pound led to a dose - dependent decrease in membrane choles - terol content ( Table II ) . This effect was paralleled by a dose - dependent decrease in the fluorescence ratio of laurdan ( Table II ) , which is an index of membrane fluidity : the higher the ratio , the lower the fluidity ( 39 ) . At the concentration of 2 . 5 m M , MCD reduced cholesterol content and fluorescence ratio of C6 cell membranes to 34 and 60 % of the control values , indicating that membranes of MCD - treated cells were more fluid than those of controls . In addition , C6 cells that had been pretreated with 5 m M MCD and then with 5 m M cholesterol - MCD com - plexes showed almost the same cholesterol content and fluo - rescence ratio as untreated controls ( Table II ) , demonstrating that the effect of MCD was reversible . Much the same was observed with the binding ability of C6 cells ( Fig . 1 A ) . These findings extend previous reports showing that choles - terol - MCD complexes can fully reverse the effects of MCD ( 36 , 37 ) . Furthermore , human CHP100 neuroblastoma cells showed the same basal level of cholesterol ( 3 . 20 (cid:3) 0 . 30 nmol / 10 6 cells ) and fluorescence ratio ( 2 . 00 (cid:3) 0 . 25 ) as C6 cells , and both parameters were changed by MCD much alike to those shown in Table II for C6 cells . Incidentally , the extent of cholesterol depletion in C6 cell plasma membranes after MCD treatment is in keeping with a recent report on cardiac myocytes ( 34 ) , while the values of cholesterol content and laurdan fluorescence of CHP100 cells corroborate a previous study ( 38 ) . Effect of MCD on AEA - induced Apoptosis in C6 Glioma Cells and in CHP100 Neuroblastoma Cells— CHP100 cells have the same ability as C6 cells to metabolize AEA and to bind it via TRPV1 , yet they are devoid of CB1 receptors ( 18 ) . In a previous study we have shown that AEA induces apoptosis in both cell types by binding to TRPV1 receptors , and that the lack of CB1R makes CHP100 cells much more sensitive than C6 cells to this pro - apoptotic agent ( 18 ) . Indeed , 10 (cid:3) M AEA induced (cid:1) 14 % apoptotic bodies formation in C6 cells after 48 h , whereas it caused (cid:1) 25 % apoptotic bodies formation in CHP100 cells at a concentration of 1 (cid:3) M ( 18 ) . These findings were confirmed in this study ( compare Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Interestingly , pretreatment of C6 cells with MCD caused a dose - dependent decrease in apoptotic bodies formation , down to a minimum of (cid:1) 25 % of the controls at 2 . 5 m M ( Fig . 6 A ) . Also co - incubation with 10 (cid:3) M CPZ , a selective TRPV1 antagonist ( 16 , 40 ) , reduced apoptosis of C6 cells ( (cid:1) 40 % of controls ) , and this effect of CPZ was additive to that of MCD ( Fig . 6 A ) . Conversely , co - incubation with 1 (cid:3) M SR141716 almost doubled the pro - apoptotic activity of AEA in controls , as already shown ( 18 ) , and prevented the anti - apoptotic effect of MCD at all doses used ( Fig . 6 A ) . Unlike C6 cells , MCD had no effect on AEA - induced apoptosis of CHP100 cells under the same exper - imental conditions , whereas 10 (cid:3) M CPZ was as effective in reducing apoptotic bodies formation in these cells as it was in C6 cells ( compare Fig . 6 , A and B ) . In addition , 1 (cid:3) M SR141716 failed to prevent apoptosis in CHP100 cells ( Fig . 6 B ) . Previous studies have shown that the anti - apoptotic effect of CB1R activation in human and rat astrocytes involves activa - tion of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) and of protein ki - nase B ( PKB ) , followed by PI3K / PKB - dependent stimulation of MAPK ( 49 , 50 ) . These observations apply also to C6 glioma cells , where the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin ( 49 ) and the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 ( 44 ) , used at 20 (cid:3) M and 200 n M respectively ( 49 , 50 ) , significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by 10 (cid:3) M AEA ( Table III ) . Interestingly , the pro - apoptotic effect of wort - mannin and that of PD98059 were not additive ( Table III ) , strengthening the hypothesis that they act along the same signaling pathway ( 50 ) . In keeping with these data , 20 (cid:3) M PD98059 abolished the anti - apoptotic effect of MCD pretreat - ment , resembling the effect of 1 (cid:3) M SR141716 ( Fig . 6 A ) . Unlike C6 cells , wortmannin and PD98059 were ineffective on programmed death of CHP100 cells induced by 1 (cid:3) M AEA F IG . 3 . Effect of MCD on AEA - induced GTP (cid:2) S binding .

Overall , the anti - apoptotic effect of MCD seems to depend on the activation of CB1R , which triggers the PI3K / PKB - dependent MAPK activa - tion . Therefore , the shutdown of CB1R or of MAPK minimizes the anti - apoptotic effect of MCD treatment . We have shown previously that a critical event along the chain leading to AEA - induced apoptosis of C6 cells and CHP100 cells via TRPV1 receptors is the disruption of mito - chondrial integrity followed by the release of cytochrome c ( 18 ) . These events have been shown to underlie the AEA - induced apoptosis of different cell types ( 20 , 51 – 53 ) , and are in common to the apoptotic pathway triggered by the TRPV1 agonist cap - saicin ( 54 ) . In keeping with our previous report ( 18 ) , 1 (cid:3) M AEA was found to induce a (cid:1) 2 - fold higher cytochrome c release in CHP100 cells than in C6 cells at a dose of 10 (cid:3) M ( Fig . 6 C ) . Remarkably , MCD was shown to block dose - dependently the AEA - induced cytochrome c release in C6 cells , while it was ineffective in CHP100 cells under the same experimental con - ditions ( Fig . 6 C ) . In addition , the effects of 1 (cid:3) M SR141716 , 10 (cid:3) M CPZ or 20 (cid:3) M PD98059 on AEA - induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria of C6 cells paralleled those on apo - ptosis ( compare Fig . 6 , A and D ) . DISCUSSION In this investigation we report new evidence that cholesterol depletion by MCD enhances the binding of CB1 receptors , and subsequent G protein - dependent signaling through AC and MAPK . We also show that the effect of MCD is reversible , and we demonstrate that MCD treatment protects CB1R - expressing C6 cells against AEA - induced apoptosis . In fact , enhanced CB1R signaling underlies the protective effect of MCD via increased MAPK activity and decreased release of mitochondrial cytochrome c . Furthermore , MCD treatment re - duces AMT activity without affecting other proteins of the endocannabinoid system . The observation that cholesterol depletion is accompanied by a 2 - fold enhancement of the binding efficiency of CB1R in C6 cells seems interesting , because recent evidence suggests that a specific groove in the transmembrane helix 6 enables CB1R to recognize AEA and related ( endo ) cannabinoids within the lipid bilayer , rather than at the cellular surface ( 55 ) . Therefore , it is conceivable that the change in membrane fluidity due to cho - lesterol depletion ( Table II ) may affect ligand recognition by the CB1 receptor , and hence its binding properties . It might be mentioned that membrane cholesterol has been shown to mod - F IG . 4 . Effect of MCD on CB1R - dependent signaling . Activity of AC .

Interestingly , endocannabinoids have been shown to be involved in all these processes through CB1R - dependent mech - anisms ( 2 , 9 ) . In the same line , it is noteworthy that cholesterol depletion by MCD pretreatment under the same conditions used here has been recently shown to increase ( up to 9 - fold ) hyaluronan binding to U87 glioma cells ( 35 ) . Unlike CB1R , TRPV1 receptors were not modulated by cho - lesterol depletion , an observation which extends recent ther - modynamic data in TRPV1 - transfected HEK cells ( 58 ) . Of in - terest is also the fact that MCD pretreatment reduced AMT activity ( Fig . 5 B ) , in keeping with a report , which appeared during the preparation of this manuscript ( 59 ) . The observation that raft disruption reduced V max without affecting K m of AMT of C6 cells seems to favor the endocytic hypothesis of McFar - land et al . ( 59 ) , who proposed that the AEA transporter may be internalized upon MCD treatment , thus reducing the number ( and hence the V max ) of transporter molecules on the cell sur - face . However , the lack of anti - AMT antibodies did not allow the quantification of AMT protein in plasma membranes . At any rate , it seems noteworthy that inhibition of AMT may contribute to enhance AEA activity at CB1 receptors , since reduced intracellular transport of AEA should increase its con - centration at the extracellular binding site of CB1R . There is a growing body of evidence that GPCRs , like CB1R , function in the context of lipid rafts , and that integrity of these compartments may be important in limiting signaling ( 26 , 60 , 61 ) . Indeed , AEA - induced stimulation of the binding of GTP (cid:2) S to C6 cells was enhanced dose - dependently by MCD , more ( (cid:1) 330 % ) than the CP55 . 940 binding ( (cid:1) 250 % ) under the same conditions ( compare Figs . 1 A and 3 A ) . Therefore , it can be suggested that raft disruption may improve not only ligand binding to CB1R but also the subsequent interaction of acti - vated CB1R with G proteins . This effect could be explained also with a faster motion of proteins within a more fluid lipid bilayer . In keeping with this observation , G protein - dependent signaling of CB1R via AC and MAPK activity was in turn enhanced by cholesterol depletion ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . There is also converging evidence that activation of CB1R protects neurons , astrocytes , and many peripheral cells against apoptosis ( reviewed in Refs . 9 and 10 ) . Interestingly , two recent reports from the same group have shown that MCD stops apoptosis induced in vitro by AEA in glioma cells ( 21 ) and hepatocytes ( 22 ) . Our results suggest that CB1R activation can fully account for the protective effect of MCD against apoptosis induced by AEA via TRPV1 receptors . This conclusion is sup - ported by the following lines of evidence : ( i ) the CB1R antago - nist SR141716 counteracted the MCD protection in CB1R - expressing C6 cells , and almost doubled apoptotic bodies formation independently of the dose of MCD ( Fig . 6 A ) ; ( ii ) MCD or SR141716 had no effect on AEA - induced apoptosis of CHP100 cells , which have the same endocannabinoid system of C6 cells but CB1R ( Fig . 6 B ) ; ( iii ) MCD protected mitochondria from AEA - induced cytochrome c release in C6 cells , while it was ineffective on mitochondria of CHP100 cells ( Fig . 6 C ) . Of further interest is the finding that CB1R - dependent pro - tection depends on the activation of MAPK , which is down - stream the PI3K / PKB pathway ( 49 , 50 , 62 ) . In turn , this in - volves activation of downstream targets like p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) , Bad , and IkB kinase , which finally stops the execution of the apoptotic program by caspase 9 ( 50 ) . It seems noteworthy that also a lower cytochrome c release from mito - chondria induces a lower caspase activity ( 63 , 64 ) , overall sug - gesting that two pathways triggered by CB1R ( i . e . MAPK ac - tivation and cytochrome c release reduction ) curb the pro - apoptotic potential of AEA by limiting the caspase activation . In the same line , depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts has been F IG . 5 . Effect of MCD on AEA metabolism in C6 cells .

This raises the suggestive hypothesis that lipid rafts alteration might be a way to modulate CB1R - dependent signaling , thus controlling cell survival within the central nervous system . This concept might be exploited for the treatment of endocan - nabinoid - related diseases such as cancer ( 10 ) , brain injury ( 12 ) , and neurodegenerative disorders ( 13 ) . In conclusion , this investigation demonstrates that lipid rafts can modulate binding and signaling of CB1R , which are enhanced by cholesterol depletion . In addition , it gives a bio - chemical background to the anti - apoptotic effect of MCD , show - ing that it depends on the protection exerted by activated CB1R through stimulation of MAPK and reduction of cytochrome c release from mitochondria .
