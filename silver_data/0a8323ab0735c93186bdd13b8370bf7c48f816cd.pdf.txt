The presence of a marker , usually antibiotic - or herbicide - resistance , allows identification of transformed seedlings from untransformed seedlings . Seedling selection is a lengthy process which does not always lead to easily identifiable transformants . Selection for kanamycin - , phosphinothricin - and hygromycin B - resistance commonly takes 7 – 10 d and high seedling density and fungal contamination may result in failure to recover transformants . Results : A method for identifying transformed seedlings in as little as 3 . 25 d has been developed . Arabidopsis T1 seeds obtained after floral dip transformation are plated on 1 % agar containing MS medium and kanamycin , phosphinothricin or hygromycin B , as appropriate . After a 2 - d stratification period , seeds are subjected to a regime of 4 – 6 h light , 48 h dark and 24 h light ( 3 . 25 d ) . Kanamycin - resistant and phosphinothricin - resistant seedlings are easily distinguished from non - resistant seedlings by green expanded cotyledons whereas non - resistant seedlings have pale unexpanded cotyledons . Seedlings grown on hygromycin B differ from those grown on kanamycin and phosphinothricin as both resistant and non - resistant seedlings are green . However , hygromycin B - resistant seedlings are easily identified as they have long hypocotyls ( 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 cm ) whereas non - resistant seedlings have short hypocotyls ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 4 cm ) . Conclusion : The method presented here is an improvement on current selection methods as it allows quicker identification of transformed seedlings : transformed seedlings are easily discernable from non - transformants in as little as 3 . 25 d in comparison to the 7 – 10 d required for selection using current protocols . Background Arabidopsis transformation mediated by vacuum infiltra - tion of inflorescences with an Agrobacterium suspension was first introduced by Bechtold et al . [ 1 ] . This method has been widely used in preference to tissue culture tech - niques as it directly produces transformed seed and negates lengthy and complicated tissue culturing proce - dures . This transformation method was further modified Published : 06 November 2006 Plant Methods 2006 , 2 : 19 doi : 10 . 1186 / 1746 - 4811 - 2 - 19 Received : 03 July 2006 Accepted : 06 November 2006 This article is available from : http : / / www . plantmethods . com / content / 2 / 1 / 19 © 2006 Harrison et al ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd .

Immersion of Arabidopsis inflorescences in a suspension of Agrobacterium , with surfactant , was sufficient to generate transformed seed . This method remains the method of choice for Arabidopsis transformation . Selection of trans - formants from non - tranformants requires the presence of a marker , usually in the form of either antibiotic or herbi - cide resistance . Selection for resistance , for example to kanamycin , typically takes 7 – 10 d following germination [ 1 , 2 ] . Whereas advances in improving and simplifying the " flo - ral dip " stage of the transformation have been developed , no significant advances in shortening or improving the selection process have been reported . Selection can be dif - ficult ; on germination , emerging cotyledons usually appear green , and transformed and non - transformed seedlings are frequently indistinguishable from each other . Over a period of 7 – 10 d , the non - transformants bleach and only the transformants remain green . During this lengthy period , fungal contamination may be a prob - lem . Fungal contaminants may be present in seed stocks generated from floral dipping , because sucrose is used in the dipping medium and plants will have been , at least initially , kept in a warm damp environment providing ideal conditions for fungal growth . During seedling selec - tion , fungal contaminants may deplete antibiotic or her - bicide present in the selection medium , such that non - transformants are able to remain green . Crowding of seed - lings on an agar plate may allow root growth above the medium and so result in a delay in bleaching of non - transformants due to decreased concentrations of selec - tion agent . To address this problem , seedlings have been incubated in flasks of liquid growth medium on a rotary shaker instead of on agar - based medium [ 3 ] . This ensures dispersal of the floating seedlings across the medium sur - face and ensures that all are exposed to the antibiotic or herbicide . Seedlings are then sorted to identify those that are green . However , the procedure does not always work well and seedlings can be of poor quality , appearing flac - cid and waterlogged ; these seedlings seldom survive trans - plantation to soil . We have developed a method of seedling selection that results in rapid , easy identification of transformants ; the protocol presented works well for screening for resistance to kanamycin , phosphinothricin and hygromycin B . Results Previously reported seed selection procedures requiring extended growth periods in the light result in seedlings with short hypocotyls [ 1 , 2 ] ; this makes the transformants difficult to remove from agar plates and may result in damage to their cotyledons . To increase hypocotyl length and so facilitate easier seedling removal , we placed seed - lings in the dark for 48 h before illumination . This pro - duced a clear cut difference between resistant and non - resistant seedlings and allowed the development of a growth regime than can distinguish seedlings resistant to kanamycin , phosphinothricin or hygromycin B from non - resistant seedlings in 3 . 25 d , as opposed to the 7 – 10 d required in previously reported selection procedures ( Fig - ure 1 ) . Following stratification for 2 d in the dark at 4°C , seeds were illuminated for 4 – 6 h to stimulate and syn - chronize germination and were then placed in the dark for 2 d where they continued to grow by hypocotyl extension . After a further 24 - h light period , transformants were easily identified . Selection of kanamycin - resistant transformants When wild - type and kanamycin - resistant seedlings grow - ing on medium containing kanamycin ( 50 μ g ml - 1 ) were examined after the 2 - d dark period , all cotyledons appeared yellow and closed , and hypocotyls were approx - imately 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 cm in length . A 24 - h light period was suf - ficient for kanamycin - resistant transformants to accumulate chlorophyll and to continue to grow photoau - totrophically . Transformants had green , open , expanded cotyledons ( Figure 2 ) . Non - transformants failed to accu - mulate chlorophyll ; after 24 h in the light , they remained pale , with either closed or unexpanded cotyledons ( Figure 2 ) . This selection regime produced green transformants that were easily distinguished from yellow non - trans - formants on medium containing kanamycin . To test the reliability of the selection protocol , it was applied to seeds derived from the transformation of Ara - bidopsis Col - 0 with a construct containing mGFP4 [ 4 ] under the control of 707 bp of the 5 ' upstream sequence of the CA1 gene ( At3g015000 ) to provide an easily iden - tifiable reporter gene activity . The construct was inserted into the binary vector pBINPLUS containing the nptII selectable marker [ 5 ] , and transferred into Arabidopsis by the floral dip method [ 2 ] . One hundred and eighteen kan - amycin - resistant seedlings were identified by the rapid selection method , as outlined above , from about 3 , 200 seeds plated on sixteen 9 - cm plates . All kanamycin - resist - ant seedlings were examined for GFP expression using flu - orescence microscopy . One hundred and ten resistant seedlings ( 93 % ) showed clearly detectable GFP fluores - cence . In three of the remainding eight kanamycin - resist - ant GFP - negative seedlings , the presence of mGFP4 was detected by PCR . Only one GFP - positive seedling was detected using fluorescence microscopy among ~ 800 kan - amycin - susceptible seedlings visualised . This demon - strates a high degree of coincidence of kanamycin - resistant and GFP - expressing seedlings , and confirms the rapid selection method is comparable to traditional selec - Plant Methods 2006 , 2 : 19 http : / / www . plantmethods . com / content / 2 / 1 / 19 Page 3 of 7 ( page number not for citation purposes ) tion methods in the proportions of false positives and false negatives obtained . A similar experiment was carried out with seeds derived from a floral - dip transformation with a pBINPLUS con - struct containing the uidA reporter gene [ 6 ] under the con - trol of the CA1 promoter . Twenty kanamycin - resistant seedlings were selected by the rapid selection method from about 600 seeds plated on three 9 - cm plates , and all kanamycin - resistant seedlings and about 200 kanamycin - sensitive seedlings were assayed histochemically for β - glu - curonidase ( GUS ) activity . Only one kanamycin - resistant seedling had no detectable GUS activity , and all kanamy - cin - susceptible seedlings assayed were negative for GUS activity . This confirms that the rapid selection method successfully identifies transformants and the level of false negatives is very low . No false positives were ever observed when wild - type Col - 0 seeds were subjected to the rapid selection procedure in the presence of kanamy - cin ( data not shown ) . We have confirmed the robustness of this rapid selection method with different Arabidopsis ecotypes , grown on dif - ferent agar media and with illumination at different light intensities . The rapid selection method , as described in the protocol , has been used successfully to identify trans - formants of Col - 0 , Ws and Ler - 0 ( data not shown ) . The addition of vitamins to the minimal MS salts had no effect on the identification of kanamycin - resistant seedlings . However , the addition of 2 % sucrose affected the effi - ciency of the selection method due to the altered mor - phology of the seedlings . Seedlings grown on 2 % sucrose showed decreased hypocotyl growth , and a longer dark period ( 3 – 4 d ) was required to enable clear identification of kanamycin - resistant seedlings . The success of the selec - tion method was not affected by illumination at three dif - ferent light intensities ( 80 μ mol m - 2 s - 1 , 120 μ mol m - 2 s - 1 and 200 μ mol m - 2 s - 1 ) . No differences in the greening of the kanamycin - resistant or wild - type seedlings were observed with these intensities of white light , in growth cabinet or growth room environments .

In the presence of 50 μ M phosphinothricin , dark - grown seedlings had extended hypocotyls ( 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 cm ) and all seedlings had yellow , closed cotyledons . Follow - ing a 24 - h light period phosphinothricin - resistant seed - lings had green , open , expanded cotyledons whereas non - transformants had pale unexpanded cotyledons ( Figure 3 ) . To confirm the phenotypes of seedlings growing in the presence of phosphinothricin , wild - type controls were grown alongside previously characterised phosphi - nothricin - resistant lines under the conditions of the rapid selection method . All characterised phosphinothricin - resistant seedlings had green expanded cotyledons ( ~ 350 seedlings in total ) , whereas all wild - type controls had pale unexpanded cotyledons , with no exceptions ( ~ 400 seed - lings in total ) . The presence of the bar gene was detected by PCR in all resistant seedlings sampled ( 2 seedlings from each of the control lines ) . Several features of the selection procedure on phosphi - nothricin were examined in more detail , but only the addition of vitamins to the selection medium had any effect . The addition of vitamins slightly enhanced the greening of phosphinothricin - susceptible seedlings , but did not compromise the success of the selection method . The phosphinothricin - resistant seedlings were uniformly much greener than the resistant seedlings . Selection of hygromycin - resistant transformants Seedlings grown in the presence of hygromycin B dis - played a different morphology to those grown in the pres - ence of kanamycin or phosphinothricin . After 2 d in the dark on medium containing hygromycin B ( 15 μ g ml - 1 ) , hygromycin - resistant transformants had long hypocotyls of approximately 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 cm , whereas non - transformants had short hypocotyls ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 4 cm ) ( Figure 4 ) . Addition - ally , in contrast to seedlings grown on kanamycin or phosphinothricin , all seedlings grown on medium con - taining hygromycin B were green after a 24 - h light period . However , selection of hygromycin - resistant seedlings from non - transformants was easily achieved by selecting those with elongated hypocotyls . To confirm the phenotypes of seedlings grown in the pres - ence of hygromycin B , wild - type controls were grown alongside previously characterised hygromycin - resistant lines obtained following transformation with pBIG - HYG [ 8 ] which confers hygromycin B resistance via the hpt Rapid selection of hygromycin B - resistant Arabidopsis thaliana Col - 0 seedlings Figure 4 Rapid selection of hygromycin B - resistant Arabidopsis thaliana Col - 0 seedlings . a .

The majority of characterised hygromycin - resistant seedlings had long hypocotyls following rapid selection . The presence of the transgene was detected in 16 ran - domly selected seedlings with this phenotype . Occasion - ally a few seedlings per plate had slightly shorter hypocotyls . For 5 independent lines containing the hpt gene the number of short seedlings were ; 0 / 189 , 4 / 194 , 5 / 235 , 0 / 177 and 0 / 201 . However , the hypocotyls of these seedlings were not as short as those seen in wild - type Col - 0 controls . In contrast , no hypocotyl elongation was seen in any wild - type Col - 0 controls ( ~ 200 seedlings ) . The ability to distinguish hygromycin B - resistant and suscepti - ble seedlings did not change following a further 2 d in the light . Discussion We have developed a method that distinguishes kanamy - cin - , phosphinothricin - and hygromycin B - resistant seed - lings from non - resistant seedlings in 3 . 25 d . This represents a considerable saving of time compared to cur - rent seedling selection methods which require a 7 – 10 - d selection period . In addition , reducing the length of the selection period minimizes the risk of seedling loss by pathogen infection . The protocol produces easily identifi - able resistant seedlings that are easily removed from selec - tion plates , due to their long hypocotyls . Kanamycin - or phosphinothricin - resistant seedlings can be distinguished from wild - type or non - transformant seedlings by the presence of chlorophyll in the expanded cotyledons . However , all seedlings grown in the presence of hygromycin B have green cotyledons , and the selection is based on hypocotyl length . Hygromycin - resistant seed - lings have extended hypocotyls in the rapid selection method , whereas wild - type and non - transformant seed - lings have short hypocotyls . The different effects of hygro - mycin B and kanamycin or phosphinothricin on hypocotyl elongation may be related to the target of these antibiotics . Hygromycin B inhibits cytosolic protein syn - thesis [ 9 ] , whereas kanamycin and phosphinothricin inhibit plastid protein synthesis [ 10 ] and glutamine syn - thase activity [ 11 , 12 ] , respectively . This suggests that cytosolic , but not plastid , protein synthesis is required for hypocotyl elongation in the dark . The length of hypocotyl extension in the dark is proportional to the amount of lipid reserve mobilized [ 13 ] and thus remaining reserves may influence the extent of chlorophyll synthesis on transfer of seedlings to the light . Wild - type or non - trans - formed seedlings grown on hygromycin B have short hypocotyls and are able to synthesize chlorophyll in the light , whereas wild - type or non - transformed seedlings grown on kanamycin and phosphinothricin have long hypocotyls and are unable to make chlorophyll . Lipid reserve mobilization is impaired in the presence of sucrose [ 14 ] and we observed that if sucrose was included in the selection medium a longer dark period ( 3 – 4 d ) was required to enable clear identification of kanamycin - or phophinothricin - resistant transformants . Conclusion We have developed a method that distinguishes kanamy - cin - , phosphinothricin - and hygromycin B - resistant seed - lings from non - resistant seedlings in 3 . 25 d . Current seedling selection methods require a 7 – 10 - d selection period . Reducing the selection period not only saves time but minimizes the risk of contamination . The protocol produces easily identifiable resistant seedlings that are easily removed from selection plates , due to their long hypocotyls .

Methods Plant material and transformation Transformations of Arabidopsis thaliana were performed by the floral dip method [ 2 ] using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 [ 15 ] . The following binary plasmids were used : pBINPLUS [ 5 ] which confers kanamycin resistance via the npt II gene ; pSKI015 [ 7 ] which confers phosphi - nothricin resistance via the bar gene ; and pBIG - HYG [ 8 ] which confers hygromycin B resistance via the hpt gene . The reporter genes uidA with added intron [ 6 ] and mGFP4 [ 4 ] were inserted into the binary vector pBINPLUS under the control of 707 bp of the 5 ' upstream sequence of the carbonic anhydrase 1 ( CA1 ) gene ( At3g01500 ) . The fol - lowing non - transformed Arabidopsis seeds , obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis stock centre ( NASC ) , were used for transformations and as controls ; Col - 0 ( NASC N1092 ) , Col - 2 ( NASC N907 ) , Col - 7 ( NASC N3731 ) , Ws ( NASC N1601 ) and Ler - 0 ( NASC NW20 ) . Previously characterised transgenic lines were used as positive con - trols ; for phosphinothricin - resistance NASC accessions N21504 , N21443 , N21461 , N21821 , N21824 and N850573 were used , and for hygromycin - resistance 5 lines transformed with pBIG - HYG containing mGFP4 ( K . Parsley unpublished data ) were used . Plant selection Seeds were surface sterilized by immersion in 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol for 2 min , followed by immersion in 10 % ( v / v ) sodium hypochlorite solution containing 8 % available chlorine ( Fisher Scientific , UK # S / 5040 / 21 ) for 10 min . Seeds were then washed four times with sterile distilled water and sown onto 1 % agar containing MS medium [ 16 ] and kanamycin monosulphate at a concentration of 50 μ g ml - 1 ( Melford Laboratories Ltd . , Ipswich , UK # K0126 ) , DL - phosphinothricin at a concentration of 50 μ M ( Melford Laboratories Ltd . # P01590250 ) , or hygro - mycin B at a concentration of 15 μ g ml - 1 ( Melford Labora - tories Ltd . # H0125 ) . Excess surface liquid was drained from the plates . Seeds were then stratified for 2 d in the Plant Methods 2006 , 2 : 19 http : / / www . plantmethods . com / content / 2 / 1 / 19 Page 6 of 7 ( page number not for citation purposes ) dark at 4°C . After stratification seeds were transferred to a growth chamber ( Multitron , Infors UK , Reigate , UK ) and incubated for 4 – 6 h at 22°C in continuous white light ( 120 μ mol m - 2 s 1 ) in order to stimulate germination . The plates were then wrapped in aluminium foil and incu - bated for 2 d at 22°C . The foil was removed and seedlings were incubated for 24 – 48 h at 22°C in continuous white light ( 120 μ mol m - 2 s - 1 ) . The final 24 – 48 h light incuba - tion need not be continuous ; selection worked well when seedlings were placed in a 16 h light , 8 h dark regime although 24 h total light was required for optimum selec - tion . This procedure has been carried out successfully using white light intensities of 80 μ mol m - 2 s - 1 , 120 μ mol m - 2 s - 1 and 200 μ mol m - 2 s - 1 in both growth cabinet and growth room environments . The selection protocol also worked well on MS medium supplemented with addi - tional vitamins ( Melford Laboratories Ltd . # M0222 ) or 2 % sucrose , but works optimally on MS medium alone . Expression studies using the uidA and GFP reporter genes Kanamycin - resistant transformants identified using the rapid selection procedure were grown in a mixture ( 3 : 1 by volume ) of standard potting compost ( Levingtons M3 ) and vermiculite , under long - day conditions ( 16 h light , 8 h dark at 22°C ) . Staining for GUS activity was carried out on 1 - cm leaf disc samples taken from 4 - week - old plants , using 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indoyl - β - D - glucuronide ( X - Gluc ) dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg . ml - 1 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) containing 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 and 5 mM each potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide [ 17 ] . Samples were incubated for 6 h at 37°C , cleared in 70 % v / v ethanol and mounted in 50 % v / v glycerol prior to examination . GUS activity in kanamycin - susceptible seedlings was detected by incuba - tion of seedlings removed from the agar plates directly into the X - Gluc assay mixture , as described above . The presence of GFP in 1 - cm leaf disc samples from 4 - week - old kanamycin - resistant plants was detected using a Nikon Optiphot - 2 epifluorescence microscope with exci - tation and emission maxima of 395 and 450 nm , respec - tively . Kanamycin - susceptible seedlings were visualized on the agar plate for the presence of GFP using a Leica MZFLIII epifluorescence microsope . Transgene detection DNA extractions and PCRs were performed using the REDExtract - N - Amp Plant PCR Kit ( Sigma - Aldrich , # XNAP ) in accordance with the manufacturer ' s instruc - tions . The bar gene was detected in phophinothricin - resistant seedlings using primers bar F 5 ' TGCACCATCGT - CAACCAC 3 ' and bar R 5 ' ACAGCGACCACGCTCTTG 3 ' . mGFP4 was detected in kanamycin - and hygromycin - resistant seedlings using primers gfp F 5 ' GGAGAA - GAACTTTTCACTGG 3 ' and gfp R 5 ' GTAATCCCAG - CAGCTGTTAC 3 ' . All PCR products were visualised on a 1 . 5 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide ( 1 μ g . ml - 1 ) . Competing interests The author ( s ) declare that they have no competing inter - ests .
