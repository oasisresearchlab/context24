Governments are now reopening their economies ; however , the opening of theaters has been delayed , owing to their ( often ) crowded audiences and potentially higher infection risk . To determine whether it is safe to reopen theaters , in this study , the transport of contaminants released by an infected person in a theater hall with an overhead air supply system is analyzed numerically . The infection risks are calculated for occupants at various distances from the infected person in different directions and with / without wearing masks based on a revised Wells - Riley model , and under different supply air states and locations of the infected person . The results show that , ﬁ rst , the probabilities of infection in return air with ﬁ ltration and all - fresh - air operations are decreased by 39 . 8 and 55 . 6 % , respectively , as compared when the return air is not ﬁ ltered . Second , the probabilities of infection for audiences sitting nine seats away from the infected person on the right , right - back , and back sides are 84 . 9 – 92 . 3 % , 37 . 3 – 74 . 0 % , and 36 . 3 – 72 . 0 % lower , respectively , than those for audiences sitting one - seat away from the infected person . In addition , sitting in separate rows can reduce the maximum probability by 7 . 4 – 68 . 3 % . Third , the probability of infection can be reduced by 93 . 7 % after all the audiences wear masks with ef ﬁ ciencies of 75 % . Fourth , the probability of infection can be controlled under a relatively safe range even though the quanta emission rate is 30 or 50 quanta / h , and even with two infected people in unfavorable seats . Thus , theaters can be safely reopened under return air ﬁ ltration or all fresh air operations , and when audiences are sitting in separate seats and wearing masks .

As of October 30 , 2020 , more than 40 million cases worldwide had been con ﬁ rmed , and the number of con ﬁ rmed cases was increasing at a rate of more than 400 , 000 per day . The epidemic of SARS - CoV - 2 has not only spread rapidly , but also has a mortality rate as high as 2 . 6 % ( World Health Organization , 2020 ) . To prevent the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , quarantines and city lockdowns have been employed by many countries , and have proven to be effective ( Cui et al . , 2020 ; D ˇ ziugys et al . , 2020 ) . However , quarantine strategies severely interfere with economic development worldwide ( Kanitkar , 2020 ; Nicola et al . , 2020 ) . The gross national product ( GDP ) of China for the ﬁ rst quarter of 2020 fell by 6 . 8 % year - on - year ( Statistics , National Bereau of Statistic in China , 2020 ) , and it was estimated that the GDP of India for the entire year of 2020 would drop by 10 – 31 % ( Kanitkar , 2020 ) . Therefore , in the face of a ﬁ nancial crisis and high unemployment , governments have introduced a series of policies for ensuring safe recoveries of production and the economy . The ﬁ lm industry has also been substantially affected by the SARS - CoV - 2 epidemic . Because theaters are always crowded with audiences ( resulting in higher infection risks ) , theaters worldwide closed after the outbreak of the pandemic . It was predicted that the global box of ﬁ ce would lose 5 billion US dollars from the pandemic ( Shoard , 2020 ) . The Chinese ﬁ lm industry has closed all its of cinemas since the Lunar New Year , and had lost 2 billion US dollars by March 2020 ( Clark , 2020 ) . From March 13 to 15 , 2020 , North America experienced its lowest box of ﬁ ce weekend since 1998 ( D ’ Alessandro , 2020 ) . Although theaters in China opened after July 20 , 2020 as a result of the relatively low infection risks in China , the ﬁ lm industry has not fully recovered to normal : many movies have been postponed , tickets are sold in separate rows of seats , and people remain worried regarding watching movies in theaters . In other countries , theaters remain closed . Both decision - makers and ordinary people are still wondering whether fully reopening theaters is safe . Like other viruses , including in ﬂ uenza , SARS , tuberculosis , and measles , it is possible for SARS - CoV - 2 to spread through the air ( Buonanno et al . , 2020 ; Morawska et al . , 2020 ; Somsen et al . , 2020 ) , and to be transmitted via exhaled droplets from an infected person to other people ( Buonanno et al . , 2020 ) . The transmission characteristics of respiratory droplets in different types of buildings have been studied by researchers using computational ﬂ uid dynamics ( CFD ) . A study on exhaled droplet transmissions between occupants in an of ﬁ ce room was conducted by He et al . ( 2011 ) and the results showed that the different ventilation strategies had signi ﬁ cant in ﬂ uences on the risk of exposure . The transmission of airborne contaminants exhaled by the nose or mouth was simulated by using N 2 O as the tracer gas in an experimental room by Villafruela et al . ( 2016 ) . The non - uniform distribution of droplets in an aircraft cabin as exhaled by coughing , breathing , and talking was studied by Gupta et al . ( 2011 ) . After obtaining the air ﬂ ow ﬁ eld , Gupta et al . used the Wells - Riley equation ( Riley et al . , 1978 ) to calculate the infection risks for passengers with different locations , and reported that infection risks could be signi ﬁ cantly reduced if the passengers wear N95 masks ( Gupta et al . , 2012 ) . Shao and Li used the revised Wells - Riley equation and CFD method to predict the infection risks for Biden , Wallace , and the audience during the ﬁ rst presidential debate ( Shao and Li , 2020 ) . However , as per the literature review , studies on the transmission of airborne contaminants and infection risks in theater halls remain rare . Nada et al . studied the air ﬂ ow pattern in a crowded theater hall ( Nada et al . , 2016 ) , but they only focused on the distribution of the velocity and temperature , and the thermal comfort of the audience . There was no research considering the distribution of polluted air , transmission of viruses , and / or probability of infection . In this study , to determine whether it is safe to reopen theaters during the COVID - 19 pandemic , the concentration distribution of a contaminant released by an infected person in a theater hall with an overhead air supply system is simulated using the CFD method under different supply air states , and with different locations of the infected person . According to the calculated results , the probabilities of infection for audiences with various distances from the infected person in different directions and with / without wearing masks are calculated using a revised Wells - Riley equation . Subsequently , recommendations for decreasing infection risks are proposed , and whether it is safe to reopen theaters during the epidemic is discussed . METHODOLOGY Probability of Infection In this study , the probability of infection was calculated using the classical Wells - Riley equation . The Wells - Riley equation was ﬁ rst proposed by Riley et al . , and achieved remarkable success in explaining the spread of a measles outbreak ( Riley et al . , 1978 ) . It is a classic probabilistic model for indicating the probability of a person becoming infected , and is commonly used when the air in the room is evenly mixed ; it is written as shown in Eq . 1 . P (cid:1) C S (cid:1) 1 − e − Iqpt / Q ( 1 ) where P is the probability of infection ; C is the number of developed infection cases ; S is the number of susceptible cases ; I is the number of primary infected cases ; q is the quanta release rate , in quanta / h ( quanta is a term de ﬁ ned as that if a person inhales one quanta , the probability of infection for him is 1 − 1 / e ) ( Wells , 1955 ) ; p is the pulmonary ventilation rate of the susceptible person , in m 3 / h ; t is the length of the exposure time , in h ; and Q is the supply air volume , in m 3 / h . After considering the impact of wearing masks , the quanta release rate ( q ) of the infected person can be calculated as q ( 1 − η I ) , and the expected value of quanta inhaled by a susceptible person ( Iqp / Q ) can be calculated as Iqp ( 1 − η S ) / Q . Here , η I and η S are the ef ﬁ ciencies of the masks for the infected and susceptible persons , respectively . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 2 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic After correcting for the masks , Eq . 1 can be rewritten as Eq . 2 . P (cid:1) 1 − e − Iqpt ( 1 − η I ) ( 1 − η S ) / Q ( 2 ) The aforementioned Wells - Riley equation assumes that the predicted probability of infection is uniform within the room ( Dai and Zhao , 2020 ) . However , under actual ventilation and air ﬂ ow patterns , the air in a room is not evenly mixed , leading to different concentrations of the quanta at different locations . To describe the non - uniform distribution of the quanta , a new parameter , the dilution ratio ( DR ) , was introduced by Shao and Li ( 2020 ) . The DR is a dimensionless parameter , and is de ﬁ ned as the ratio of the quanta concentration at the infected person to the quanta concentration at the susceptible person , as shown in Eq . 3 . DR (cid:1) E 0 (cid:1) E S ( 3 ) where , E S is the expected value of quanta concentration at the susceptible person , in quanta / m³ ; E 0 is the value of the quanta concentration in the breath of an infected person , in quanta / m³ , and is calculated using Eq . 4 . E 0 (cid:1) q (cid:1) p ( 4 ) When not considering the role of masks , and the supply air is only composed of fresh air , then DR (cid:1) Q / Ip for the fully mixed condition , i . e . , the ratio of the supply air volume to total polluted air volume as exhaled by all of the infected people ; E S (cid:1) E 0 DR (cid:1) qpDR . Therefore , the expected value of the inhaled quanta by a susceptible person per unit time is q / DR . Based on DR , Eq . 1 can be written as Eq . 5 . P (cid:1) 1 − e − qt / DR ( 5 ) After considering the role of masks , the concentration of the quanta at the infected person is ( 1 − η I ) E 0 (cid:1) ( 1 − η I ) q / p , and the concentration of the quanta inhaled by the susceptible person is E S (cid:1) ( 1 − η I ) ( 1 − η S ) E 0 / DR . Considering the role of masks , Eq . 5 can be written as Eq . 6 . P (cid:1) 1 − e − qt ( 1 − η I ) ( 1 − η S ) / DR ( 6 ) It is convenient to analyze the probability of infection after considering the DR in a complex and non - uniform environment . Equations 1 – 6 can be used when the supply air does not contain any quanta . For commonly implemented primary return air systems , the quanta released by infected people moves back to the room again with the return air , leading to higher infection risks . Therefore , for a primary return air system , the quanta concentration in the supply air ( E 4 ) should be considered . For common theaters , one theater hall is served by one air handling unit ( AHU ) ( Wan , 2012 ; Liu , 2014 ; Fu et al . , 2018 ) thus , E 4 can be calculated based on the distribution of the quanta concentration ( E 1 − E 4 ) in the system , as shown in Figure 1 . For a primary return air system , the supply air comprises the return air and fresh air , and their volumes obey Eq . 7 . Q (cid:1) Q f + Q r ( 7 ) where Q f is the fresh air volume ; and Q r is the return air volume ( both in m 3 / h ) . After the air ﬂ ow in the system reaches a balance , the quanta concentration at the air exhaust , can be calculated using Eq . 8 . E 1 (cid:1) E 4 + Iq (cid:3) 1 − η I (cid:4)(cid:1) Q ( 8 ) where E 1 and E 4 are the quanta concentration at the air exhaust and air inlet , respectively , in quanta / m³ , as shown in Figure 1 . After part of the air leaves the system , the quanta concentration of the return air ( E 2 ) is equal to E 1 , as shown in Eq . 9 . E 2 (cid:1) E 1 ( 9 ) Because fresh air is considered as clean air , i . e . , without contamination by viruses , the quanta concentration at the mixing chamber of the AHU ( E 3 ) can be calculated using Eq . 10 . E 3 (cid:1) Q r Q E 2 ( 10 ) After considering the ﬁ ltration ef ﬁ ciency of the return air ( η r ) , the quanta concentration of the supply air is calculated by Eq . 11 . E 4 (cid:1) E 3 (cid:3) 1 − η r (cid:4) ( 11 ) By combining Eqs 8 – 11 , the conservation of the quanta in the primary return air system can be described using Eq . 12 . FIGURE 1 | Distribution of quanta rate in a primary return air system . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 3 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic E 4 (cid:1) (cid:3) 1 − η r (cid:4) Q r Q (cid:5) E 4 + Iq (cid:3) 1 − η I (cid:4) Q (cid:6) ( 12 ) Therefore , the quanta concentration of the supply air ( E 4 ) can be obtained based on Eq . 12 . The supply air state is determined based on the return air volume ( Q r ) and ﬁ ltration ef ﬁ ciency of the return air ( η r ) . Either an increase in the return air volume or a decrease in the ﬁ ltration ef ﬁ ciency will lead to an increase in the quanta concentration of the supply air , resulting in higher infection risks . Considering the supply air states , Eq . 2 can be rewritten as Eq . 13 . P (cid:1) 1 − e − [ Iq ( 1 − η I ) + QE 4 ] pt ( 1 − η S ) / Q ( 13 ) When the system is under all fresh air operation , Q r and E 4 are zero ; thus , Eq . 13 is equal to Eq . 2 . In this study , there is one infected person in the theater hall , and the breath of the infected person and supply air are taken as the quanta source . The local concentration of the quanta is simulated using the CFD method . Subsequently , the local DR is obtained , and the local probability of infection is calculated using Eq . 6 . The diameter of the new coronavirus has been observed as 0 . 06 – 0 . 14 μm ( Zhu et al . , Massachusetts Medical Society , 2020 ) , and the diameters of the expiratory aerosols , which are the carriers of the new coronavirus , are between 1 and 1 , 000 μ m ; however , their diameters shrink rapidly ( by approximately 50 % ) after evaporation . Thus , the diameters of the droplet nuclei mostly fall in the range of 1 – 10 μ m , and can be considered as passively transported with the air ﬂ ow , leading to a greater probability of infection for the susceptible person ( Gao et al . , 2008 ) . Tracer gas is a commonly used method for indicating the concentration distribution ( s ) of passively transported pollutants . Thus , this study uses tracer gas to determine the local quanta concentration , and then the local DR . At the end of December 2020 , more than 10 thousand cases are con ﬁ rmed every day in London , covering more than 0 . 12 % of the city ’ s total population ( Londen Evening Standard , 2020 ) . This proportion is for the whole city , however , for the areas where the epidemic is relatively more serious , the proportion is much higher . Thus , the probability of an infected person in the theater hall is assumed as 1 % ( the actual value is expected to be lower ) . The overall probability of infection is the combined FIGURE 2 | Physical model and grid distribution of the theater hall : ( A ) physical model ; ( B ) grid distribution at the ceiling and air inlet ; ( C ) grid distribution at the audience and nose . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 4 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic result of the probability of an infected person in the theater hall and the probability of an audience being infected by that infected person during a movie . The overall probability of infection is considered as four levels , i . e . , very dangerous , dangerous , slightly dangerous , and safe when the value is larger than 0 . 1 % , 1 . 0E - 4 - 0 . 1 % , 1 . 0E - 5 - 1 . 0E - 4 , and less than 1 . 0E - 5 , respectively . Thus , based on the calculated probability of infection for the audience , the risk level for an audience can be considered as very dangerous , dangerous , slightly dangerous , and safe when the value of the probability of an audience being infected by an infected person during a movie is larger than 10 % , 1 – 10 % , 0 . 1 – 1 % , and less than 0 . 1 % , respectively . Computational Model of CFD The physical model of the theater hall was selected according to the size of an actual movie theater hall , as shown in Figure 2A . The computational domain of this study was 15 . 4 m ( length ) × 8 . 0 m ( width ) × 6 . 1 m ( height ) , and had seats arranged as 10 rows and 10 lines . An overhead mixing air ﬂ ow was adopted in the theater hall : six square ceiling diffusers were arranged as the air inlets on the ceiling and two air exhausts were in the back of the theater hall , with an independent AHU ( as commonly adopted in theaters ) ( Wan , 2012 ; Liu , 2014 ; Fu et al . , 2018 ) . 100 square ceiling simulators were used to simulate the 100 seated audiences and the size of each simulator was 0 . 4 m ( length ) × 0 . 4 m ( width ) × 0 . 9 m ( height ) ( Nada et al . , 2016 ) . To simulate the air exhaled by the infected person , the nose was simpli ﬁ ed to an opening with a diameter of 0 . 01 m ( Gao et al . , 2008 ) . The grids for the air inlets and the nose of the infected person were denser than surroundings , as shown in Figures 2B , C , respectively . The local concentration of the polluted air exhaled by the infected person was calculated by solving the species equation of the tracer gas . CO 2 was chosen as the tracer gas , and its mass fraction at the nose of the infected person was considered as 4 % . The steady ﬂ ow ﬁ eld of the modeled theater hall was solved using the commercial software ANSYS FLUENT 16 . 0 . The Boussinesq model was adopted to consider the buoyancy effect . The standard k - ε model was used to calculate the turbulence ﬂ ow , and the standard wall function was chosen , as y + was 5 – 30 for most of the walls in the simulated region . The ﬁ nite volume method was used to discretize the turbulence and continuity equations . The body force weighted scheme was used for the discretization of the pressure equation , and the second - order upwind scheme was used for the discretization of the momentum , energy , and species equations . The pressure – velocity coupling was achieved by the “ semi - implicit method for pressure - linked equations ” ( SIMPLE ) algorithm . After the normalized residuals for the continuity , momentum , turbulence , energy , and species equations achieved 10 – 4 , 10 – 6 , 10 – 5 , 10 – 7 , and 10 – 5 , respectively , and the parameters ( velocity , temperature , and mass fraction of CO 2 ) of each monitoring point did not change much with iteration , it was considered that the solution had converged . Setup of Cases To calculate the probability of infection , the parameters for Eqs . 1 – 15 were chosen . In the theater hall , one infected person with a pulmonary ventilation rate of 0 . 3 m 3 / h ( Jin , 2010 ; Dai and Zhao , 2020 ) was considered . As audiences are sitting still when watching a movie lasting 2 . 5 h , the quanta release rate for the infected person was chosen as 10 . 5 quanta / h ( Buonanno et al . , 2020 ; Dai and Zhao , 2020 ) . The ef ﬁ ciencies of the ordinary medical surgical masks and N95 masks were considered as 60 % ( Dai and Zhao , 2020 ) and 90 % ( Gupta et al . , 2012 ) , respectively . Therefore , in this study , the ef ﬁ ciencies of the masks for infected and susceptible persons were both considered as 75 % . The ﬁ ltration ef ﬁ ciency of the return air was considered as 60 % . Because the fresh air volume for the theater hall per capita was 20 m³ / h ( Ministry of Housing and Urban - Rural Development of the People ’ s Republic of China , 2012 ) , the total fresh air volume for the 100 audiences was set as 2 , 000 m³ / h . According to the designed parameters of the AHU for the theater hall , the total supply air volume was 8 , 000 m³ / h for adequate indoor velocity and temperature distributions . Thus , the return air volume was considered as 6 , 000 m³ / h . To determine the optimal ventilation strategies during the epidemic , three different supply air states were chosen , as follows . ( 1 ) Fresh air + return air without ﬁ ltration : the supply air contained 2 , 000 m³ / h of fresh air and 6 , 000 m³ / h of return air , and the return air was not ﬁ ltered . ( 2 ) Fresh air + return air with ﬁ ltration : the supply air contained 2 , 000 m³ / h of fresh air and 6 , 000 m³ / h of return air , and the return air was ﬁ ltered , with an ef ﬁ ciency of 60 % . ( 3 ) All Fresh air : the supply air contained 8 , 000 m³ / h of fresh air only . The pollutant distribution was signi ﬁ cantly affected by the relative positional relationship between the pollution source , air inlets , and air exhausts ( Li and Zhao , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the infection risks by considering different locations for the front , middle , and back seats , six positions were selected for the infected person , as shown in Figure 2A . The infected person was assumed to be located at row 1 , line 10 ( R1L10 ) ; row 5 , line 10 ( R5L10 ) ; row 10 , line 10 ( R10L10 ) ; row 1 , line 5 ( R1L5 ) ; row 5 , line 5 ( R5L5 ) ; and row 10 , line 5 ( R10L5 ) . Additionally , four lines and three planes were selected for the grid independence study , validation , and presentation of the results , and their locations are shown in Figure 2A . Line 1 was selected for the grid independence study and validation , TABLE 1 | Parameters of each working condition . Case no .

Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic based on presenting the variations in the velocity , temperature , and mass fraction of the CO 2 . Three sample lines , i . e . , Lines 2 to 4 , with directions as right , right - back , and back , were selected for calculating the probability of infection with various distances from the infected person at R1L10 . The three planes were selected to show the ﬂ ow ﬁ eld and mass fraction distribution of the CO 2 . Planes 1 and 2 show the details of the vertical sections through the noses of audiences in lines 5 and 10 , respectively . Plane 3 shows the details of the section through the noses of all the audiences . It was believed that these three planes can provide suf ﬁ cient information regarding the theater hall . From the combination of the two aforementioned factors , i . e . , the supply air state and position of the infected person , eight working conditions were selected in this study , and their parameters are shown in Table 1 . In Cases 1 to 3 , the impact of the supply air state on the probability of infection was compared . In Cases 3 to 8 , the impacts of the positions of the infected person on the probability of infection were compared . Additionally , the probabilities of infection when sitting in separate rows and lines , and when wearing or not wearing masks were also calculated and compared . The boundary conditions for these eight cases are listed in Table 2 . Square ceiling diffusers were used as air inlets , owing to their high air ﬂ ow rates and high mixing effects . The momentum model was developed by Srebric and Chen ( 2002 ) , and was used to simulate a square ceiling diffuser by dividing it into sixteen areas and providing the velocity and direction of each area , respectively . Thus , in this study , the square ceiling diffusers were considered as a velocity inlet with a velocity angle of 30 ° between the velocity direction and ceiling , and the effective area of each diffuser was divided into sixteen equal - sized areas , with four rows and four columns . The velocity magnitude was calculated as the ratio of the supply air volume to the effective area of the air inlet , and the temperature of the supply air was considered as 20 ° C . Additionally , the mass fraction of CO 2 for the air inlets was determined according to Eq . 8 . The nose of the infected person was considered as a velocity inlet with denser grids and the velocity magnitude was calculated according to the exhaled air volume and nose area . The human bodies were considered as constant heat ﬂ ux walls , and only the sensible heat was calculated . Grid Independence Study and Validation Grid Independence Study Unstructured grids obtained by ICEM CFD 16 . 0 were chosen in this study . The grid was denser where the gradients of velocity , temperature , and concentration were larger , i . e . , the regions near the nose of the infected person , air inlets and exhausts , and wall . In Case 1 , three different grids ( 1 , 052 , 450 cells , 1 , 993 , 370 cells , and 2 , 917 , 572 cells ) were used to study the grid independence . Because natural convection and forced convection existed simultaneously in the room , the grid independence study was a challenge ( He et al . , 2011 ) . The velocity , temperature , and mass fraction distribution were presented along the selected Line 1 , as shown in Figure 3 . The variances of velocity along Line 1 were similar for the three grids , however , the variances of temperature and mass fraction along Line 1 for grids with 1 , 993 , 370 cells and 2 , 917 , 572 cells were similar and were different from those for grid with 1 , 052 , 450 cells . Therefore , the grid with 1 , 993 , 370 cells was chosen for the study , because of its suf ﬁ cient accuracy and low computational time consumption . Validation The distributions of the velocity , temperature , and concentration in a theater hall are signi ﬁ cantly affected by the supply air parameters . Therefore , validation was completed by comparing the velocity and temperature distributions near the square ceiling diffuser between the results simulated by this study , and the experimental results reported by Srebric and Chen Srebric and Chen ( 2002 ) . The distributions of the dimensionless velocity and dimensionless temperature along Line 1 are shown in Figures 4A , B , respectively . The discrepancies between the results from the CFD model used in this study and the experimental results from Srebric and Chen ( 2002 ) , are acceptable . Thus , the CFD models presented in this study can be used to predict the ﬂ ow ﬁ eld in a room in ﬂ uenced by square ceiling diffusers . RESULTS AND ANALYSIS The ﬂ ow ﬁ eld of the theater hall was calculated using the CFD method , and the distributions of the mass fraction of CO 2 under various supply air states and various locations of infected person are presented below . Subsequently , the probabilities of infection are calculated , and the results are analyzed . Flow Field and Temperature Distribution The infection risk was calculated according to the concentration distribution of CO 2 in the theater hall , which was affected by the ﬂ ow ﬁ eld . Thus , the ﬂ ow ﬁ eld is considered ﬁ rst . TABLE 2 | Boundary conditions .

Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic As the exhaled air volume from the infected person is signi ﬁ cantly less than the clean air volume supplied by the air inlets , the indoor ﬂ ow ﬁ eld is mainly affected by the air inlets and air exhausts . Thus , the ﬂ ow ﬁ elds in the theater hall for the eight cases are similar , as shown in Figure 5 . The supply air ﬂ ow moves closely to the ceiling after leaving the air inlets , and moves downward after colliding with other air ﬂ ows or the wall . For the plane through the audiences at line 5 , because the square ceiling diffusers are arranged above rows 2 , 6 , and 9 , the audiences sitting in rows 4 , 8 , and 10 are mainly affected by the downward air ﬂ ows , as shown in Figure 5A . After hitting the audiences and the ﬂ oor , the supply air moves upward , and part of it is entrained by the supply air ﬂ ow . Thus , local vortexes are generated , and the upward air ﬂ ow returns to the bottom of the theater hall . The local vortexes are mainly located above rows 3 and 5 and in front of row 1 , and are not conducive to the diffusion of pollutants . As shown in Figure 5B , for the plane through the audiences at line 10 , the audiences sitting at rows 1 , 4 , and 9 are mainly affected by the downward air ﬂ ow . Owing to the suction of the air exhaust on the left side of Plane 2 , the direction of the air ﬂ ow is upward in FIGURE 3 | Comparison between different numbers of grids along Line 1 : ( A ) variationofvelocity ; ( B ) variationoftemperature ; ( C ) variationofmassfraction .

Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic row 10 , and pollutants can be easily moved from the room . Additionally , owing to the suction of the air exhaust , the air ﬂ ow moves from row 8 at the top to row 9 at the bottom . The in ﬂ uence of the air exhaust on the ﬂ ow ﬁ eld is smaller than that of the air inlets ; thus , only the back area of the theater hall is affected by the air exhaust . FIGURE 5 | Flow ﬁ eld and temperature distribution in the theater hall : ( A ) ﬂ ow ﬁ eld in Plane 1 ; ( B ) ﬂ ow ﬁ eld in Plane 2 ; ( C ) temperature distribution in Plane 1 ; ( D ) temperature distribution in Plane 3 . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 8 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic The temperature distribution in the theater hall for the eight cases are similar , as shown in Figures 5C , D . For Plane 1 ( the plane passing through the audiences in ﬁ fth line ) , the temperature is relatively high at the bottom of the theater hall , especially at the ﬁ rst to the third rows because of the local vortex , as explained in Figure 5A . The buoyancy effect affects the temperature distribution around the audiences : The temperature in the upper area is higher than that in the lower area around the audiences . However , the buoyancy effect , also known as natural convection , is weaker than forced convection . Thus , the indoor temperature distribution is mainly affected by supply air ﬂ ow . As shown in Figure 5D , the temperature for most of the area in Plane 3 ( the plane passing through all the audiences ) is in the range of 22 – 26 ° C , though higher temperature areas exist locally . Thus , the air conditioning system is adequate for controlling the environment of the theater . Impact of Supply Air State The probabilities of infection were calculated based on the concentrations of CO 2 near the noses of the audiences . Therefore , the mass fraction distribution of CO 2 in Plane 3 , that is , the plane passing through the noses of all the audiences , is presented below . FIGURE 6 | Distribution of mass fraction of CO 2 in Plane 3 : ( A ) Case 1 ; ( B ) Case 2 ; ( C ) Case 3 . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 9 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic When the infected person is located at R1L10 , i . e . , far from the air inlets and air exhausts , the distributions of the mass fraction of CO 2 in Plane 3 with different supply air states as “ Fresh air + return air without ﬁ ltration , ” “ Fresh air + return air with ﬁ ltration , ” and “ All fresh air ” are shown in Figures 6A – C , respectively ; the right side of Figure 6 represents the front of the theater hall . The magnitude of the mass fraction changes with changes in the supply air states , resulting in different infection risks . When the valve controlling the return air is turned on , part of the pollutant exhaled by the infected person moves back to the theater hall again from the air inlets , resulting in a larger background concentration . When the return air is ﬁ ltered , part of the pollutant can be removed and the supply air is cleaner than that without ﬁ ltration , leading to a lower background concentration . When the supply air is fully composed of fresh air , only the pollutant exhaled by the infected person can directly in ﬂ uence the distribution of the mass fraction . Thus , Case 1 shows the largest mass fraction of CO 2 , followed by Case 2 and Case 3 , and the overall infection risks of the audiences gradually decrease from Case 1 to Case 3 . The relative positional relationships between the infected person , air inlets , and exhausts are identical for the three cases ; therefore , the distributions of the mass fraction of the CO 2 for the three cases are similar . In general , the exhaled air from the infected person severely affects the front of the theater hall , especially the audiences sitting close to the infected person , i . e . , the audiences at R1L9 and R1L8 . As the distance from the infected person increases , the probability of infection decreases . The ﬁ rst row is the most affected , followed by the second row , and relatively less of the polluted air reaches the back area of the theater hall . FIGURE 7 | Distribution of mass fraction of CO 2 in Plane 2 : ( A ) Case 1 ; ( B ) Case 2 ; ( C ) Case 3 . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 10 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic The mass fraction distributions of the CO 2 in Plane 3 for the three cases are shown in Figures 7 – C , respectively . The polluted air moves downward after leaving the nose of the infected person because of the downward air stream , as shown in Figure 5B . The local vortex existing in front of row 1 makes the downward air ﬂ ow move upward , but part of it circulates and moves back to the audiences in row 1 . Thus , adjacent audiences are affected . Additionally , part of the pollutant moves to rows 5 and 6 owing to the supply air ﬂ ow above , and the local vortex prevents the diffusion of pollutants . Thus , the concentration here is relatively larger than in the adjacent area . The impacts of the supply air states on the probability of infection for Cases 1 to 3 were compared . The probabilities of infection when all the audiences are not wearing masks under the three different supply air states along Lines 2 to 4 are shown in Figure 8 . The probability of infection is always the largest in Case 1 , followed by Cases 2 and 3 . Thus , ﬁ ltration of the return air and all fresh air operation can signi ﬁ cantly reduce the probability of infection . Although the values of the probabilities for the different supply air states are different , they have the same trend when changing with the position of the audience . When the distance from the infected person gradually increases to the right , the probability of infection decreases rapidly , from 2 . 84 to 3 . 09 % in the ninth line to 0 . 90 – 1 . 14 % in the eighth line ; then , it gradually decreases to 0 . 22 – 0 . 47 % , as shown in Figure 8A . When the distance from the infected person gradually increases in the right - back direction , the probability of infection also gradually decreases . It decreases from 0 . 25 to 0 . 50 % at R2L9 to 0 . 17 – 0 . 41 % at R3L8 , then increases to 0 . 18 – 0 . 43 % at R4L7 , and ﬁ nally decreases gradually to 0 . 07 – 0 . 31 % , as shown in Figure 8B . This can be explained by the entrainment effect of the supply air : the polluted air moves down again in row 4 , leading to a local high probability of infection for the audience . When the distance from the infected person gradually increases to the back , the probability of infection ﬁ rst decreases from 0 . 25 to 0 . 50 % in row 2 to 0 . 13 – 0 . 38 % at 4 , then increases to 0 . 17 – 0 . 41 % at row 5 , and ﬁ nally decreases gradually to 0 . 07 – 0 . 32 % , as shown in Figure 8C . Based on the results , it is necessary for the audiences to sit at certain distances , e . g . , audiences should be arranged in separate seats . FIGURE8 | Probabilityofinfectionunderthreedifferentsupplyairstates : ( A ) Line 2 ; ( B ) Line 3 ; ( C ) Line 4 FIGURE 9 | Probability of infection when wearing or not wearing masks for Cases 1 – 3 . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 11 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic The probabilities of infection for all the audiences in the theater hall ( except for the infected person ) when wearing masks or not wearing masks and under different supply air volumes are presented in Figure 9 . When not wearing masks , the probabilities of infection for Cases 1 to 3 are 0 . 31 – 3 . 09 % , 0 . 13 – 2 . 91 % , and 0 . 07 – 2 . 84 % , respectively , and the average values are 0 . 45 , 0 . 27 , and 0 . 20 % , respectively . Compared with the return air is not ﬁ ltered , the probabilities of infection for return air with ﬁ ltration and all fresh air operation decrease by 39 . 8 and 55 . 6 % , respectively . Therefore , an all fresh air operation of the air - conditioning system and installation of a ﬁ lter device on the return air duct are recommended for achieving a smaller overall probability of infection . Additionally , wearing masks can signi ﬁ cantly reduce the overall probability of infection . When all the audiences , including the infected person , wear masks with ef ﬁ ciencies of 75 % , the probabilities of infection in Cases 1 to 3 are 0 . 02 – 0 . 20 % , 0 . 01 – 0 . 18 % , and 4 . 1E - 05 – 0 . 18 % , respectively , leading the risk level to decrease from dangerous / slightly dangerous to slightly dangerous or safe . Impact of Location of the Infected Person To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the infection risks , when the supply air state is “ All fresh air , ” the mass fraction distributions of CO 2 under Cases 4 – 8 with different positions of the infected person are presented in Figures 10 , 11 , and are compared with those under Case 3 . In Case 4 , the infected person is located at row 5 , line 10 . Because of the upward air ﬂ ow at the nose as shown in Figure 5B , the polluted air exhaled by the infected person moves upward . However , local vortices exist above the infected person ; thus , the pollutant gathers here , and part of it moves downward with the supply air , reaching row 4 again , as shown in Figure 11A . Thus , the audiences sitting in row 4 , especially at R4L8 , R4L9 , and R4L10 have higher infection risks than others , as shown in Figure 10A . In Case 5 , the infected person sits in row 10 , line 10 , which is under the air exhaust . As shown in Figure 10B , the magnitude of the mass fraction in Plane 3 is lower than that in Cases 3 and 4 . This phenomenon can be explained by the entrainment of the air exhaust : most of the exhaled air from the infected person moves upward and leaves the room , as shown in Figure 11B , resulting in a minimal in ﬂ uence on other audiences . In Case 6 , the infected person sits in row 1 , line 5 . As shown in Figure 10C , the magnitude of the mass fraction at the right side of Plane 3 is signi ﬁ cantly higher than that at the left part . This is explained by the large vortex existing at the front of the theater hall , as shown in Figure 5A . The exhaled pollutant ﬁ rst moves upward as the air ﬂ ows after leaving the infected person . However , until it reaches the ceiling , it is infected by the supply air from the front diffusers , and moves toward the screen . Then , it collides with the screen and ﬂ oor and moves to the audiences sitting at row 1 again to complete its cycle , as shown in Figure 11C . Thus , all the audiences in row 1 and some in row 2 are signi ﬁ cantly affected . FIGURE 10 | Distribution of mass fraction of CO 2 in Plane 3 : ( A ) Case 4 ; ( B ) Case 5 ; ( C ) Case 6 ; ( D ) Case 7 ; ( E ) Case 8 . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 12 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic In Case 7 , the infected person sits in row 5 , line 5 . As shown in Figure 10D , the magnitude of the mass fraction around the infected person is signi ﬁ cantly large , resulting in large infection risks for audiences in the middle of rows 5 and 6 . Because the infected person sits under the downward air stream , as shown in Figure 5A , the exhaled pollutant moves downward , which is different from the aforementioned cases . Thus , the exhaled pollutant cannot quickly leave the audience zone , affecting a large area , as shown in Figure 11D . In Case 8 , the infected person sits in row 10 , line 5 . The pollutant moves downward as shown in Figure 11E owing to the downward air stream near the infected person ( as shown in Figure 5A ) , moves to the left and right at the bottom for a certain distance , and moves up , owing to the entrainment effects of the air exhausts . Thus , the audiences at R10L4 and R10L6 are not severely affected , but the audiences sitting under the two air exhausts , that is , the audiences at R10L1 and R10L7 to R10L10 , are signi ﬁ cantly affected , as shown in Figure 10E . When wearing masks or not wearing masks , the probabilities of infection for all the audiences in the theater hall , except for the infected person , and under different positions of the infected person , are presented in Figure 12 . When not wearing masks , the probabilities of infection for Cases 3 to 5 are 0 . 07 – 2 . 84 % , 0 . 05 – 0 . 27 % , and 4 . 14E - 10 – 9 . 79E - 09 , respectively , as corresponding to the location of the infected person sitting in Line 10 , but from the front to the back of the theater hall ; the average values are 0 . 20 , 0 . 12 % , and 2 . 44E - 09 , respectively . When not wearing masks , the probabilities of infection for Cases 6 to 8 are 0 . 06 – 0 . 35 % , 0 . 05 – 2 . 05 % , and 3 . 0E - 07 – 0 . 94 % , respectively , as corresponding to the location of the infected person sitting in Line 5 but from the front to the back of the theater hall ; the average values are 0 . 16 , 0 . 17 , and 0 . 03 % , respectively . For Cases 3 , 4 , 6 , and 7 , when the infected person sits in the front or middle of the theater hall , there exists a certain distance from the infected person to the air exhaust and the exhaled pollutant stays longer in the room because of the downward streams or local vortexes , resulting in larger probabilities of infection . However , for Cases 5 and 8 , when the infected person sits at the back of the theater hall and is near the air exhaust , the majority of the exhaled pollutant can be removed directly , thereby achieving a relatively low probability of FIGURE12 | Probabilityofinfectionwhenwearingornotwearingmasks for Cases 3 – 8 . FIGURE 11 | Distribution of mass fraction of CO 2 in Plane 2 : ( A ) Case 4 ; ( B ) Case 5 ; ( C ) Case 6 ; ( D ) Case 7 ; ( E ) Case 8 . Frontiers in Built Environment | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 637277 13 Liang et al . Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic infection . The probability of infection is the lowest in Case 8 , because the infected person is the closest to the air exhaust . Additionally , when all the audiences wear masks , the overall probability of infection can be signi ﬁ cantly reduced by 93 . 7 % ( as compared with the situation without wearing masks ) . The probabilities of infection when wearing masks for Cases 3 – 8 are 4 . 1E - 05 – 0 . 18 % , 3 . 2E - 05 – 0 . 02 % , 2 . 6E - 11 – 6 . 1E - 10 , 4 . 0E - 05 – 0 . 02 % , 3 . 3E - 05 – 0 . 13 % and 1 . 9E - 08 – 5 . 9E - 04 , respectively . As mentioned in Impact of Supply Air State , because the probability decreases as the distance from the infected person increases , maintaining a certain distance while arranging the seats is necessary for safely reopening the theater . When the audiences are sitting in separate rows and lines but not wearing masks , the maximum probabilities are 0 . 90 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 29 , and 1 . 02 % , respectively , and the average probabilities are 0 . 18 , 0 . 21 , 0 . 16 , and 0 . 16 % , respectively , for the infected person being located at R1L10 , R5L10 , R1L5 , and R5L5 . Compared with the results of Cases 3 , 4 , 6 , and 7 , arranging the seats in separate rows and lines can signi ﬁ cantly reduce the maximum infection risks by 68 . 3 , 7 . 4 , 50 . 2 , and 17 . 1 % ( the effect of reducing the average value is insigni ﬁ cant ) , respectively , which is bene ﬁ cial for reopening the theater . DISCUSSION The probabilities of infection for Cases 1 to 8 when wearing or not wearing masks are calculated based on the assumption that the quanta emission rate is 10 . 5 quanta / h , according to Buonanno et al . ( 2020 ) and Dai and Zhao ( 2020 ) . However , this value is estimated when the audience is resting and breathing . To decide whether it is safe to reopen theaters , this study takes two larger values for the quanta emission rate as 30 and 50 quanta / h to discuss the probabilities , which are in the reasonable range described by Buonanno et al . ( 2020 ) . The probabilities of infection when quanta emission rates are 30 and 50 quanta / h are shown in Table 3 . Comparing Cases 1 – 3 , the average probability of infection decreases signi ﬁ cantly after using return air ﬁ ltration and is less than 1 % ( slightly dangerous ) after operation under all fresh air condition , even when the quanta emission rate is as high as 50 quanta / h . Thereby , ﬁ ltration of the return air can signi ﬁ cantly reduce the overall infection risks for all of the audiences , and all fresh air operation can further guarantee the lowest overall infection risks . Thus , they are both recommended ventilation strategies for reopening theaters . If all the audiences wear masks with 75 % ef ﬁ ciency , the probability of infection can be reduced by 93 . 7 % . Even under unfavorable conditions ( e . g . , the infected person at R1L10 ; return air without ﬁ ltration ; 50 quanta / h ) , the maximum and average probabilities are 0 . 93and0 . 13 % , respectively ; thus , the risklevelisconsideredasslightly dangerous . However , for the majority of other cases when wearing masks , the overall risk level can be considered as safe . Therefore , wearing masks should be required when reopening theaters . Additionally , the infection risks when there are two infected people ( located at two unfavorite seats : R1L10 and R5L5 ) are considered , and are compared with the results of Cases 3 and 7 . As tracer gas is passively transmitted , the probabilities for the two - infected - people condition are calculated according to the summary of the CO 2 concentrations for Cases 3 and 7 . When not wearing masks and under 10 . 5 , 30 , and 50 quanta / h , the maximum probabilities under the two - infected - people condition are 2 . 90 , 8 . 05 , and 13 . 06 % , respectively , i . e . , approximately the same as the maximum values for Cases 3 and 7 , and the average probabilities are 0 . 38 , 1 . 07 , and 1 . 77 % , respectively , i . e . , approximately the summary values for Cases 3 and 7 . Thus , even though there may exist two infected people in unfavorable seats after opening theaters , the maximum probabilities change little , and can be avoided by sitting in separate rows and lines . The average probabilities increase signi ﬁ cantly , but can be decreased by wearing masks : the average probabilities are 0 . 02 , 0 . 07 , and 0 . 11 % after wearing masks , and are considered approximately safe , along with those using return air ﬁ ltration or all fresh air operation . When all the audiences are wearing masks during a 2 . 5 - h movie , but the infected person takes offthe mask for halfan hour , the overall possibilities of infection are calculated by weighting the length of the two periods : the infected person wears mask for 2 h and doesn ’ t wear mask for half an hour . The results show that compared with the conditions when the infected person wears mask during the whole movie , the possibilities of infection increase 60 % . When quanta emission rate is 10 . 5 quanta / h , the largest probabilities of infection for Cases 1 – 8 are 0 . 32 % , 0 . 29 % , 0 . 29 % , 0 . 03 % , 9 . 8E - 10 , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 21 % , and 0 . 09 % , respectively , which can still be considered as enough safe . In summary , even though the quanta emission rate may be as high as 30 – 50 quanta / h and there may exist two infected people , TABLE 3 | Probability of infection when quanta emission rates are 30 and 50 quanta / h .

Reopen Theaters during COVID - 19 Pandemic theaters can be reopened safely under return air ﬁ ltration or all fresh air operation , and when the audiences are sitting in separate seats and wearing masks . CONCLUSION In this study , the distribution of the polluted air released by an infected person in a theater hall with an overhead air supply system is numerically calculated using the CFD method under different supply air states and different locations of the infected person . Based on the simulated results and a revised Wells - Riley equation , the probabilities of infection for audiences with various distances from the infected person in different directions and with / without wearing masks are calculated . Recommendations for decreasing the infection risks are proposed , and whether it is safe to reopen theaters is discussed . Unfavorable situations are discussed , e . g . , when the quanta emission rate is high and there are two infected people . According to the results , the following conclusions are drawn . ( 1 ) The probabilities of infection for return air ﬁ ltration and all fresh air operation decrease by 39 . 8 and 55 . 6 % , respectively , relative to when the return air is not ﬁ ltered . Thus , an all fresh air operation of the air - conditioning system and an installation of a ﬁ lter device on the return air duct are recommended . ( 2 ) The probabilities of infection for the audiences sitting nine seats away from the infected person on the right , right back , and back are 84 . 9 – 92 . 3 % , 37 . 3 – 74 . 0 % , and 36 . 3 – 72 . 0 % lower , respectively , than those of the audiences sitting one seat away from the infected person . Thus , for safety and epidemic prevention , the audiences should keep a certain distance when sitting . Sitting in separate rows can reduce the maximum probability by 7 . 4 – 68 . 3 % . ( 3 ) The probability of infection can be reduced by 93 . 7 % if all the audiences wear masks with ef ﬁ ciencies of 75 % . The maximum and average probabilities of infection do not exceed 0 . 20 and 0 . 03 % , respectively , and are considered to be suf ﬁ ciently safe . Thus , the audiences should be required to wear masks when watching a movie . ( 4 ) After adopting the recommended methods in conclusions ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) , the probability of infection can be controlled within a relatively safe range , even when , e . g . , the quanta emission rate is 30 or 50 quanta / h , and there are two infected people in unfavorable seats . Thereby , under return air ﬁ ltration or all fresh air operation , when all the audiences are sitting in separate seats and wearing masks , theaters can be safely reopened .
