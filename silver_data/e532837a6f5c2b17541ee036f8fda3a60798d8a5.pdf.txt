We have delineated a Ca 2 + - signaling pathway down - stream of the NMDA receptor that stimulates cal - modulin - dependent kinase kinase ( CaMKK ) and CaMKI to promote formation of spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons . CaMKK and CaMKI form a multiprotein signaling complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) b PIX and GIT1 that is localized in spines . CaMKI - mediated phos - phorylation of Ser516 in b PIX enhances its GEF ac - tivity , resulting in activation of Rac1 , an established enhancer of spinogenesis . Suppression of CaMKK or CaMKI by pharmacological inhibitors , dominant - negative ( dn ) constructs and siRNAs , as well as ex - pression of the b PIX Ser516Ala mutant , decreases spine formation and mEPSC frequency . Constitu - tively - active Pak1 , a downstream effector of Rac1 , rescues spine inhibition by dnCaMKI or b PIX S516A . This activity - dependent signaling pathway can promote synapse formation during neuronal development and in structural plasticity . INTRODUCTION Dendritic spines are essential for proper functioning of the ner - vous system as they are the primary postsynaptic recipients of excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS ( Carlisle and Kennedy , 2005 ; Hayashi and Majewska , 2005 ; Tada and Sheng , 2006 ) . The role of spines in cognition is suggested by the fact that several forms of mental retardation ( e . g . , Down’s , Rett , Fragile X , and fe - tal alcohol syndromes ) exhibit a reduction in spine density as well as a predominance of very long , thin ﬁlopodia at the expense of mature mushroom - shaped spines ( Kaufmann and Moser , 2000 ; van Galen and Ramakers , 2005 ) . Spine density and morphology are regulated developmentally as well as in response to synaptic plasticity . During synaptogenesis , dendritic ﬁlopodia are thought to represent initial dendritic projections which , if they contact an axon , can mature into mushroom - shaped spines that constitute functional synapses ( Ethell and Pasquale , 2005 ; Matsuzaki et al . , 2004 ; Ziv and Smith , 1996 ) . Spine morphology is very dynamic and modulated by several signaling pathways that regulate its actin - rich cytoskeleton ( Bon - hoeffer and Yuste , 2002 ; Calabrese et al . , 2006 ; Dillon and Goda , 2005 ; Fischer et al . , 1998 ; Hering and Sheng , 2001 ) . One of the best characterized pathways for modulating actin dynamics in - volves the Rho family of small GTPases ( G proteins ) , Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 ( Nakayama et al . , 2000 ; Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ; Tada and Sheng , 2006 ) . Intriguingly , seven genes that regulate Rho GTPase signaling were detected in a screen for genes that cause nonspeciﬁc X - linked mental retardation ( Ram - akers , 2002 ) . There are several downstream effectors of these GTPases , including the WASP / WAVE family , Rho - associated ki - nase ( ROCK ) and p21 - activated kinase Pak1 , that modulate ac - tin polymerization ( Ethell and Pasquale , 2005 ; Tada and Sheng , 2006 ) . The activation state of these small G proteins is deter - mined by their GTP - loading dictated by exchange factors called guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase acti - vating proteins ( GAPs ) ( Rossman et al . , 2005 ) . GEFs promote GTP - loading whereas GAPs inactivate G proteins by promoting hydrolysis of the bound GTP . Two recent studies have demonstrated a role in spinogenesis for the GEF b Pak - interacting exchange factor ( b PIX ) ( Zhang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . b PIX contains an N - terminal SH3 domain , a Dbl motif containing Rac / Cdc42 GEF activity , a pleckstrin ho - mology domain , and a GIT1 - binding region near its C terminus ( Rosenberger and Kutsche , 2006 ) . Subcellular localization of b PIX within dendritic spines to the postsynaptic density is medi - ated largely by scaffold proteins such as GIT1 ( Ko et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) and Shank ( Park et al . , 2003 ) . Since b PIX is a Rac GEF and one of the major effectors of Rac is Pak1 , which binds to the SH3 domain of b PIX , b PIX coordinates Rac - depen - dent activation of Pak1 ( Mott et al . , 2005 ) . Rac activation has been demonstrated in spines ( Zhang et al . , 2005 ) , and overex - pression of dominant - negative Rac decreases the number of spines and synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons and sli - ces ( Nakayama et al . , 2000 ; Penzes et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . There are numerous downstream effectors of Pak1 that regulate actin dynamics ( Bokoch , 2003 ) . 94 Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . Although signaling downstream of b PIX has received signiﬁ - cant attention , little is known about upstream pathways that modulate the b PIX signal complex . A likely signaling molecule is intracellular Ca 2 + which is regulated by neuronal activity and is known to modulate spine morphology and actin dynamics ( Konur and Ghosh , 2005 ) . Effects of Ca 2 + on actin and spine mor - phology / motility are complex and determined by its mode of entry , concentration , and temporal duration ( Oertner and Matus , 2005 ) . Ca 2 + entry through NMDA receptors ( NMDARs ) stabilizes spine morphology ( Ackermann and Matus , 2003 ) and may repre - sent a mechanism for activity - dependent increases in spine number and volume ( Maletic - Savatic et al . , 1999 ) . There are sev - eral mechanisms that might mediate these effects including Ca 2 + - regulated , actin - binding proteins such as gelsolin ( Star et al . , 2002 ) or proﬁlin ( Ackermann and Matus , 2003 ) . A role for Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent protein kinases ( CaMKs ) has also been implicated through the use of the general CaMK inhibitor KN - 62 that blocks activity - and NMDAR - dependent remodeling of dendritic spines ( Matsuzaki et al . , 2004 ) . Using pharmacological inhibitors , dominant - negative ( dn ) and constitutively active con - structs and siRNAs , we have identiﬁed a signaling pathway upstream of b PIX by which NMDAR activation during neuronal development or plasticity can modulate spinogenesis . CaMKK / CaMKI interacts with b PIX / GIT1 and mediates phosphorylation of Ser516 in b PIX to enhance Rac activity and promote forma - tion / stabilization of mushroom - shaped spines . RESULTS Interaction of CaMKs with the b PIX / GIT1 Complex To determine if members of the CaMK cascade ( i . e . , CaMKK , CaMKI , CaMKIV ) are constituents of multiprotein signaling com - plexes , we initiated a proteomics approach to identify potential interacting proteins . Members of the CaMK cascade containing a Flag - epitope were transfected into HEK293 cells , puriﬁed by immunoprecipitation , washed , and associated proteins identi - ﬁed by tandem mass spectrometry ( Natsume et al . , 2002 ) . Sev - eral members of the CaMK cascade exhibited interactions with numerous proteins ( data not shown ) , the most intriguing of which were protein 14 - 3 - 3 and b PIX , a Rac1 / Cdc42 GEF . Identiﬁcation of 14 - 3 - 3 was conﬁrmatory as we previously demonstrated that 14 - 3 - 3 interacts with and inhibits PKA - phosphorylated CaMKK ( Davare et al . , 2004 ) . However , b PIX was of special interest in the context of recently described roles of CaMKK and CaMKI in neuronal development of axons ( Wayman et al . , 2004 ) and dendrites ( Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2007 ; Wayman et al . , 2006 ) . The neuronal actin cytoskeleton is regulated in numerous and complex ways by small G proteins such as Rac and Cdc42 ( Nakayama et al . , 2000 ; Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ; Tada and Sheng , 2006 ) . Next , we coexpressed in HEK293 cells Flag - tagged CaMKK ( a and b isoforms ) , CaMKI ( a , b , d , and g isoforms ) or CaMKIV with a signaling complex ( b PIX , GIT1 , Pak1 ) previously demon - strated to regulate the actin cytoskeleton ( Mott et al . , 2005 ; Rosenberger and Kutsche , 2006 ) . Only b CaMKK exhibited ro - bust interaction with all three members of the complex : b PIX , GIT1 , and Pak1 ( Figure 1A ) . To conﬁrm whether these interac - tions occur in brain , CaMKI , CaMKII , CaMKIV , and CaMKK were immunoprecipitated from brain lysates of p6 rats , and the presence of coprecipitated b PIX and GIT1 was determined . The antibodies for immunoprecipitation of CaMKI and CaMKK were speciﬁc for the a and b isoforms , respectively—other iso - form speciﬁc antibodies were not available . Again , b CaMKK exhibited signiﬁcant coprecipitation of the multiple isoforms of brain b PIX as well as GIT1 ( Figure 1 B ) , consistent with the results from the HEK293 cells . Since our subsequent studies Figure 1 . b CaMKK and a CaMKI Interact with the b PIX / GIT1 Complex ( A ) Coimmunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells . HEK293 cells were transfected with a ( upperband ) and b PIX ( myc - tagged ) , GIT1 ( EGFPfusion ) , Pak1 ( Xpress - tagged ) , and the indicated Flag - tagged CaMK . Duplicate cell lysates were im - munoprecipitated with Flag antibody , washed , and western blotted for the proteins indicated on the left . All of the transfected proteins were expressed to similar levels ( see cell lysate ) under all protocols . ( B ) Coimmunoprecipitation from rat brain lysate .

( C ) Coimmunoprecipitation from rat hippocampus . Hippocampal lysates from P12 rat were immunoprecipitated with antibody to b CaMKK , washed , and western - blotted for b PIX , GIT1 , CaMKK , CaMKI , and phospho - CaMKI ( pCaMKI ) . ( D ) Coprecipitation of b PIX and GIT1 with a CaMKI . Brain lysate from the indi - cated postnatal days ( PND ) were immunoprecipitated with antibody to a CaMKI , washed , and western blotted . Neuron Activity - Dependent Regulation of Synaptogenesis Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 95 were conducted using hippocampus , we also examined the presence of this b CaMKK / b PIX / GIT1 complex in hippocampal lysates from p12 rats ( Figure 1C ) . In this coimmunoprecipitation complex we were able to also detect CaMKI using both the a CaMKI antibody as well as a phosphospeciﬁc antibody against the CaMKK phosphorylation / activation site , Thr177 ( Haribabu et al . , 1995 ) . To further verify the existence of CaMKI in this complex , brain lysates from postnatal day 0 to adult were immu - noprecipitated with antibody to a CaMKI—western analysis revealed the coimmunoprecipitation of b PIX and GIT1 ( Fig - ure1D ) . These resultsdemonstrate theformationofasignalsome containing b CaMKK , a CaMKI , b PIX , and GIT1 in brain . Since the proteomic and HEK293 cell experiments indicated direct binding of b PIX to b CaMKK , we mapped out their interac - tion domains . A kinase - dead ( KD , K194E ) mutant of b CaMKK bound b PIX similar to wild - type b CaMKK ( see Figure S1 available online ) , and the catalytic domain ( residues 137 – 519 ) did not in - teract ( Figure S2C ) , indicating that kinase activity is not required for this interaction . Binding of b PIX to b CaMKK was not affected by the absence or presence of Ca 2 + / CaM ( Figure S2B , last two lanes ) , suggesting that this complex may exist constitutively with nonactivated CaMKK . Binding studies using fragments of b CaMKK or b PIX revealed that the N - terminus of b PIX ( residues 1 – 97 ) interacted with the N - terminus of b CaMKK ( residues 1 – 136 ) ( Figure S2 ) . This region of b PIX contains the SH3 domain that binds multiple proteins including Pak1 ( Mott et al . , 2005 ) , but a mutation of the SH3 domain ( SHm , W43P , W44G ) , which obviated Pak1 binding , did not disrupt binding to b CaMKK ( Figure S1 ) . Theonly known function of the N - terminus of CaMKK is to bind protein 14 - 3 - 3 ( Davare et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , we explored whether binding of 14 - 3 - 3 to PKA - phosphorylated b CaMKK affected its interaction with b PIX , but binding of 14 - 3 - 3 had no effect ( data not shown ) . Phosphorylation of b PIX by CaMKK / CaMKI Proteinkinasesareoftencolocalizedwiththeirsubstratestocon - fer subcellular speciﬁcity to signaling pathways ( Pawson and Scott , 2005 ) , so we explored whether b PIX might be a substrate for the b CaMKK / CaMKI pathway . Two sites in b PIX have been described : phosphorylation of Thr526 by Pak1 ( Shin et al . , 2002 ) and Ser516 and Thr526 by PKA ( Chahdi et al . , 2005 ) . In vitro 32 P - phosphorylation of wild - type b PIX and the T526A and S516A mutants was performed using a CaMKI activated by b CaMKK aswell as byPKA andPak1 . All kinasesgaveequivalent total 32 P - incorporation into wild - type b PIX ( Figure 2A ) . Phosphorylation by a CaMKI , but not PKA or Pak1 , was obviated in the S516A mutant , whereas Pak1 appeared to predominantly phosphorylate T526 . To further examine phosphorylation of b PIX in situ , we generated an antibody speciﬁc for phosphoryla - tion of Ser516 . Wild - type and the S516A mutant of myc - b PIX were expressed in HEK293 cells which were subsequently stim - ulated with ionomycin , forskolin , or the phorbol ester PMA to ac - tivate endogenous CaMKs , PKA , and PKC , respectively . In the absence of stimulation , there was no immunoreactivity , whereas ionomycintreatmentstronglyenhancedS516phosphorylation of the wild - type but not S516A mutant b PIX ( Figure S3 , left panel ) , conﬁrming that the antibody detects phospho - Ser516 . Note that Ca 2 + - dependent phosphorylation of Ser516 was blocked by cotransfected dominant - negative members of the CaMK cas - cade ( Figure S3 , right panel ) , strongly implicating endogenous CaMKK and CaMKI as the catalysts for b PIX Ser516 phosphory - lation in HEK293 cells . Stimulation with forskolin or PMA did not increase Ser516 phosphorylation , consistent with our observa - tion that PKA does not phosphorylate this site in vitro ( Figure 2A ) . Figure 2 .

Neuron Activity - Dependent Regulation of Synaptogenesis 96 Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . To verify that phosphorylation of b PIX occurs within the b CaMKK / a CaMKI / b PIX / GIT1 signaling complex , brain lysates from p6 rats were immunoprecipitated with b CaMKK antibody to isolate this complex . The immunoprecipitate was then incu - bated with Mg 2 + / ATP with or without Ca 2 + / CaM and analyzed by western blot ( Figure 2B ) . There was robust Ca 2 + / CaM - depen - dent phosphorylation of Ser516 in b PIX within this complex . Note the mobility shift of CaMKK that occurs due to its autophosphor - ylation ( Wayman et al . , 1997 ) as well as an increase in pCaMKI in the complex due to its activation by CaMKK . When the complex was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to GIT1 , a similar Ca 2 + / CaM - dependent in vitro phosphorylation of b PIX was observed ( not shown ) . Finally , we investigated Ca 2 + - dependent Ser516 b PIX phos - phorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons . Neurons were transfected with myc - b PIX because we wanted to assess b PIX phosphorylation when endogenous kinases were suppressed by cotransfection with speciﬁc inhibitory constructs . Prior to elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + by KCl depolarization , cells were treated for 2 hr with 0 . 5 m M TTX to reduce basal phosphorylation due to the spontaneous neuronal activity in these cultures ( see Figure 6A ) . KCl treatment gave a large increase in Ser516 phos - phorylation ( Figure 2C ) , and this b PIX phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly suppressed by cotransfection with either dnCaMKI or dnCaMKK . Elevated intracellular Ca 2 + will also activate PKA through CaM - dependent adenylyl cyclase ( Wong et al . , 1999 ) , and there may be some inhibition ( p > 0 . 05 ) by cotransfection with the PKA inhibitor PKI . We conclude that in hippocampal neurons CaMKK / CaMKI phosphorylated Ser516 in b PIX in response to robust Ca 2 + elevation . Regulation of b PIX GEF Activity by CaMKI - Mediated Phosphorylation Having demonstrated phosphorylation of Ser516 in b PIX by CaMKK / CaMKI in hippocampal neurons , the next question was whether this phosphorylation was regulatory . Of most inter - est would be if phosphorylation of b PIX enhanced activation of Rac and / or Cdc42 and their downstream targets leading to mod - ulation of actin dynamics ( Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ) . HEK293 cells were transfected with wild - type or the S516A mutant of myc - b PIX without or with cotransfected caCaMKI . Cell lysates were mixed with GST fusions of either Rac1 ( T17N ) or Cdc42 ( T17N ) . The T17N mutants bind GDP , but not GTP , thereby stabilizing the binding of Rac1 or Cdc42 to the GEF do - main of b PIX ( Feng et al . , 2004 ) . Binding of Rac1 and Cdc42 to b PIX were determined using GST pull - downs and then quantiﬁ - cation of coprecipitated myc - b PIX . As shown in Figure 3A , the presence of caCaMKI increased the interaction between b PIX and both Rac1 or Cdc42 by 3 - to 4 - fold . Most importantly , this enhanced interaction was obviated in the S516A mutant , indicat - ing that phosphorylation of 516 in b PIX by CaMKI was likely re - sponsible for this increased interaction . Having demonstrated that CaMKI - mediated phosphorylation of Ser516 in b PIX enhanced its interaction with Rac and Cdc42 , we next determined whether there was an effect on its GEF activ - ity to stimulate GTP loading of Rac . The CRIB domain ( residues 67 – 150 ) ofPak1 , whichspeciﬁcallybindsGTP - loadedRac , fused to GST was used for a Pak pull - down assay . HEK293 cells were transfected with myc - Rac1 and wild - type or S516A b PIX . The cells were treated without or with ionomycin , and the GTP - loaded Rac that coprecipitated with GST - Pak1 ( 67 – 150 ) was quantiﬁed . Transfected Rac1 exhibited some GTP loading that was elevated about 70 % by ionomycin treatment ( Figure 3B ) , probably due to GEF activity of endogenous b PIX or Tiam ( Flem - ing et al . , 1999 ) . Not surprisingly , transfection with wild - type b PIX enhanced basal GEF activity by about 70 % that was further in - creased 2 - fold in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner . These are the same conditions that enhanced phosphorylation of b PIX by CaMKK / CaMKIinHEK293cells ( FigureS3 ) . Toascertainwhether the Ca 2 + - dependent increase in GEF activity of b PIX was due to phosphorylation of Ser516 , we transfected the S516A mutant , and this construct did not exhibit Ca 2 + - dependent GEF activity ( Figure 3B ) . Finally , Ca 2 + - dependent regulation of b PIX was assessed in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons by ﬂuorescent reso - nance energy transfer ( FRET ) analysis of transfected Raichu - Rac . Raichu - Rac contains Rac and the CRIB domain of Pak1 ﬂanked with YFP on the N terminus and CFP on the C terminus ( Itoh et al . , 2002 ) . In the absence of GEF activity , GDP is bound to Rac so it does not bind the CRIB domain , and there is no FRET between the YFP and CFP . Upon activation of a GEF to load GTP on Rac , Rac - GTP binds the CRIB domain , bringing YFP and CFP into close proximity to allow FRET . In Raichu - Rac transfected hippocampal neurons , depolarization by KCl eli - cited an increase in dendritic Rac activation for at least 5 min ( Figures 3C – 3E and S4 ) . The elevated Ca 2 + presumably stimu - lated endogenous GEFs including b PIX , Tiam ( Tolias et al . , 2005 ) , and perhaps others such as kalirin ( Ma et al . , 2003 ) . This activation of Rac was mediated largely by CaM - dependent pro - tein kinases since the KCl effect was completely obviated by the presence of the general CaM - kinase inhibitor KN - 93 ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . We were unable to test effects of the CaMKK inhibitor STO - 609 because of its photo - instability at the relevant wave - lengths . Cotransfection of wild - type b PIX gave a modest but signiﬁcant further increase in FRET , whereas cotransfection with the S516A mutant acted in a dominant - interfering manner to partially suppress Ca 2 + - dependent Rac activation ( Figure 3F ) . To summarize , this series of experiments in Figure 3 demon - strate CaMKI - mediated phosphorylation of Ser516 in b PIX in - creased its interaction with Rac1 / Cdc42 and enhanced its GEF activitytowardRac , aknownmodulatoroftheactincytoskeleton . Role of CaMKK / CaMKI - Mediated Phosphorylation of b PIX on Synaptogenesis Spine formation has been reported to be modulated by the b PIX / GIT1 complex ( Zhang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) , so we examined whether CaMKI - mediated phosphorylation of b PIX alters spino - genesis and synaptogenesis in DIV 7 – 12 cultured hippocampal neurons . This is the time period of developmental formation of spines ( Figure S5 ) and synapses—we are unable to reliably record AMPAR mEPSCs at DIV 7 ( not shown ) , whereas DIV 12 neurons show abundant mEPSCs ( Figure 6 ) . Because our signal - ing pathway likely modulates the actin cytoskeleton in spines , we used mRFP - b actin , which has been used extensively ( Brunig et al . , 2004 ; Calabrese and Halpain , 2005 ; Fischer et al . , 2000 ; Star et al . , 2002 ) , to quantify changes of spine density and Neuron Activity - Dependent Regulation of Synaptogenesis Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 97 morphology . b and g actin are preferentially localized in dendritic spines ( Kaech et al . , 1997 ) , the postsynaptic component of syn - apses . Expressed b actin is coincident with endogenous actin in spines and apparently present in trace amounts since rhoda - mine - phalloidin staining is not signiﬁcantly increased in trans - fected versus nontransfected neurons ( Kaech et al . , 1997 ) . Cul - tured hippocampal neurons were transfected with mRFP - b actin plus other plasmids on 7 DIV and ﬁxed on 12 – 14 DIV . These neurons exhibit normal dendritic arborization with numerous dendritic protrusions ( Figure S6 ) , and the density of mush - room - shaped spines and ﬁlopodia were quantiﬁed on 50 m m segments of three different dendrites for each cell . We identiﬁed spines by their mushroom - shaped morphology with intense puncta of mRFP - b actin at their tip ( head ) , whereas ﬁlopodia were long , thin protrusions with low and constant mRFP - b actin expression throughout ( Figure 4A , left ) . When DIV 12 cultures transfected with mRFP - b actin were also stained for the presyn - aptic marker synapsin 1 ( Figures 4A and S10 ) , 97 % of spines ( n = 616 ) showed apposing synapsin 1 staining , whereas only 17 % of ﬁlopodia ( n = 149 ) did . Thus , our operational deﬁnition identiﬁes mushroom - shaped spines as morphological synapses , and we use the terms interchangeably . We also immunostained for pCaMKI which was distributed throughout the cell ( excluding the nucleus , not shown ) with apparent enrichment in spines ( Figure 4B , middle ) . Thus , spines in cultured neurons contain pCaMKI together with GIT1 and b PIX ( Ko et al . , 2003 ; Park et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) , consistent with a signaling com - plex . Furthermore , western blot analysis of puriﬁed rat postsyn - aptic densities ( PSDs ) revealed that a and b CaMKK and a CaMKI are present in the PSD of spines ( Figure S7 ) . We ﬁrst examined the role of spontaneous neuronal activity in spine formation . Figures 4C and 4D demonstrate that about 2 / 3 of the dendritic projections fall into the mushroom - shaped spine / synapse category with 1 / 3 classiﬁed as ﬁlopodia . Treat - ment with the NMDAR antagonist APV or with the sodium channel blocker TTX dramatically decreased the density of spines with no effect on ﬁlopodia ( Figure 4C ) , demonstrating a strong positive role for afferent neuronal activity that is consis - tent with most ( Collin et al . , 1997 ; Kossel et al . , 1997 ; Segal et al . , 2003 ) but not all ( McKinney et al . , 1999 ) reports . Next , the potential role of CaMKK in spine formation was probed us - ing STO - 609 , a pharmacological inhibitor of CaMKK whose Figure 3 .

Incubation of neurons with STO - 609 gave a 50 % suppression of spine formation , and this effect was reversed by transfection with a single - point mutant of b CaMKK ( V269F ) that is relatively insensitive to STO - 609 inhibi - tion ( Tokumitsu et al . , 2003 ; Figure 4D ) . This rescue experiment is very strong evidence that STO - 609 effects were mediated by CaMKK . Do the phosphorylation states of CaMKI and b PIX in the above experiments correlate with spine density ? Lysates from cultured neurons treated with APV , TTX , or STO - 609 were incubated with antibody to GIT1 to immunoprecipitate the multiprotein complex that was then analyzed by western blots . In contrast to the experiment of Figure 2C , endogenous neuronal activity was not suppressed . In the absence of treatments ( i . e . , basal ) , there was signiﬁcant pCaMKI and p b PIX ( Figure 4E ) , consistent with a potential role of b PIX phosphorylation in spinogenesis . Figure 4 .

The role of CaMKK isoforms was further investigated using siRNAs to suppress expression of the endogenous kinases . Transfection of HEK293 cells with siRNAs for a or b CaMKK com - pletely suppressed expression of their respective transfected CaMKK isoform ( Figure S8A ) . When cultured neurons were trans - fected with siRNA speciﬁc for either a or b CaMKK , both sup - pressedformationofspines ( Figure4F ) aswellasphosphorylation of cotransfected myc - b PIX ( Figure 4G ) . Thus , reducing endoge - nousCaMKKisoformswithsiRNAswasassociatedwithsuppres - sion of both b PIX phosphorylation and formation of spines . We next examined the roles of CaMKI , b PIX , and Pak1 in regulating synaptogenesis . Figures 5A – 5C demonstrate that Figure 5 . Role of CaMKI and b PIX S516 Phosphorylation on Spinogenesis ( A – C ) Cultured hippocampal neurons ( DIV 7 ) were transfected with mRFP - b actin plus either dnCaMKI or b PIX ( WT , S516A , or a mutant [ DHm ] devoid of GEF activity ) ± caPak1 as indi - cated . On DIV 14 neurons were ﬁxed , stained for synapsin 1 , and images were analyzed for density of spines and ﬁlopodia ( A ) . Synapses ( B ) were identiﬁed as spines with adjacent staining of syn - apsin 1 ( see Figure S10 ) . ( D and E ) Neurons ( DIV 7 ) were transfected with mRFP - b actin plus siRNAs for rat ( Rn ) a or b CaMKI ( D ) or b PIX ( E ) ± plasmids expressing human a CaMKI or human ( Hs ) b PIX ( WT or S516A ) as in - dicated . Spines / ﬁlopodia were analyzed as in Fig - ure 4 . HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag - tagged a CaMKI from rat ( Rn ) or human ( Hs ) plus siRNA for rat a CaMKI , lysed , and immunoblotted for Flag and myosin heavy - chain IIb ( MHCIIb , loading control ) ( [ D ] , top panel ) . HEK293 cells transfected with Myc - tagged b PIX from rat or hu - man or Myc - tagged rat a PIX plus siRNA for rat b PIX were immunoblotted for Myc and ERK2 ( loading control ) , as indicated ( [ E ] , top panel ) . ( F and G ) Neurons ( DIV 7 ) were cotransfected with mRFP - b actin plus other constructs as indicated , ﬁxedonDIV14 , andanalyzed forspineheadwidth ( F ) andlength ( G ) . * * p < 0 . 001 , comparedtocontrol . dnCaMKI and the S516A mutant of b PIX blocked spine and synapse formation as didamutantof b PIX ( DHm ) lackingafunc - tional GEF domain . Importantly , the abili - ties of dnCaMKI and the S516A b PIX mutant to reduce spine number were res - cued by coexpression of caPak1 ( Fig - ure 5C ) , consistent with Pak1 being downstream of CaMKI and b PIX / Rac . We again used the siRNA approach to verify the results from overexpression of dnCaMKI and to investigate roles of spe - ciﬁc CaMKI isoforms . The speciﬁcity of each siRNA for its corresponding CaMKI isoform has been established in HEK293 cells and used in cul - tured neurons ( Wayman et al . , 2006 ) . The siRNA for a CaMKI phe - nocopied the effect of dnCaMKI , and the suppression of spine formation was rescued by expression of a human a CaMKI that was not susceptible to the siRNA ( Figure 5D ) . The efﬁcacy of the siRNA for endogenous a CaMKI was veriﬁed by immunocyto - chemistry using an antibody that is speciﬁc for the a isoform . Neurons transfected with siRNA for a CaMKI showed little or no immunoreactivity compared to non - transfected neurons ( Figure S8B ) . On the other hand , siRNA for b ( Figure 5D ) or d ( data not shown ) CaMKI isoforms had little or no effect , indicat - ing speciﬁcity among the various CaMKI isoforms . We were un - able to test siRNA for g CaMKI because expression of this con - struct for 4 days was deleterious to the health of the cultured neurons . Moreover , siRNA for b PIX also blocked spine formation Neuron Activity - Dependent Regulation of Synaptogenesis 100 Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . to the same extent as the siRNA for a CaMKI , and this was also rescued by expression of the siRNA - resistant human isoform of wild - type b PIX but not the S516A mutant ( Figure 5E ) . This result strongly supports the critical role of Ser516 in b PIX for its function in spinogenesis . In addition to spine density , the diameter of the spine head and spine length are thought to be important parameters . Induction of LTP results in an increase in spine head size and a reduction in spine length ( Yuste and Bonhoeffer , 2001 ) . Therefore , we ex - amined whether manipulation of the CaMKK / CaMKI / b PIX sig - naling complex would impact either spine head diameter or spine length . Expression of dnCaMKI or S516A b PIX or siRNA for a CaMKI or b PIX , all of which dramatically reduced spine den - sity ( Figures 4 and 5 ) , had little effect on spine head width ( Figure 5F ) . However , disruption of this signaling pathway did signiﬁcantly increase spine length ( Figure 5G ) . Although transfected b - actin is present in low amounts com - pared to endogenous actin ( Kaech et al . , 1997 ) , its expression alone might modulate spine density or morphology . To test this possibility , we quantiﬁed these parameters under our experi - mental conditions using transfected soluble tomato ﬂuorescent protein ( TFP ) . Spine density and spine head diameter in TFP - transfected neurons ( Figure S9 ) were not signiﬁcantly different from cells expressing mRFP - b - actin ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . Spine length was not quantiﬁed with TFP because the intensity of TFP expression in the dendritic shaft artiﬁcially increased the apparent diameter of the dendrite ( Figure S9 ) , making measure - ments of spine length inaccurate . To further verify our conclusion from morphological evidence ( Figures 4A and S8 ) that most mushroom - shaped spines are functional synapses , we recorded miniEPSCs ( mEPSCs ) from 12 DIV cultured neurons . Figures 6A – 6C show that transfection with either dnCaMKI or S516A b PIX gave a 60 % reduction in the frequency of mEPSCs with little or no change ( p > 0 . 05 ) in amplitude . The resting membrane potential was not different between the various transfections ( control , (cid:2) 57 . 7 ± 1 . 3 ; dnCaMKI , (cid:2) 55 . 4 ± 1 . 3 ; S516A b PIX , (cid:2) 56 . 7 ± 1 . 5 ( mV ) ; n = 8 – 12 ) , demonstrating that expression of these constructs was not deleterious to the health of the neurons . The lack of effect of dnCaMKI and S516A b PIX expression on mEPSC amplitude is consistent with no effect on spine head diameter ( Figure 5F ) since there appears to be a good correlation between the abun - dance of postsynaptic AMPARs and the size of dendritic spine heads ( Matsuzaki et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , mIPSC frequency and amplitude were not affected by transfection with either dnCaMKI or S516A b PIX ( Figures 6D – 6F ) , indicating speciﬁcity for excitatory neurotransmission . This is expected since most inhibitory synapses do not involve spines but occur directly on the dendrite . Regulation of Spinogenesis in Organotypic Hippocampal Slices To extend the above studies in cultured hippocampal neurons to a more physiological system , we chose cultured hippocampal slices . Organotypic slices have been used extensively to study hippocampal functions because they retain most of the cellular and morphological organization of the intact hippocampus ( Bahr , 1995 ; Caeser and Aertsen , 1991 ) . Slices from p7 pups were cultured for 2 days , subjected to biolistic transfection and then ﬁxation on DIV 5 . Transfected neurons were visualized with mRFP - b actin , and dendritic protrusions were analyzed by confocal microscopy . As in the cultured neurons , about 2 / 3 of projections were classiﬁed as spines ( Figure 7 ) . Most impor - tantly , spine formation was strongly suppressed by treatments with either APV , TTX , STO - 609 , or transfection with dnCaMKI or the S516A mutant of b PIX ( Figure 7 ) . Thus , it appears that the same signaling pathway of activity - induced NMDAR - depen - dent activation of CaMKK / CaMKI phosphorylation of b PIX that regulates spinogenesis in cultured neurons is also operative in hippocampal slices . DISCUSSION The present study delineates a signaling pathway triggered by afferent neuronal activity that couples stimulation of the NMDAR to activation of a signaling complex containing b CaMKK / CaMKI / b PIX that is localized in dendritic spines ( Figure 8 ) . In this com - plex , CaMKI phosphorylates Ser 516 in b PIX to stimulate its GEF activity , resulting in activation of Rac1 and Pak1 which are known to be essential for formation of spines in cultured hip - pocampal neurons ( Zhang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . Although we chose to primarily investigate effects of b PIX phosphorylation on its Rac Figure 6 . Effect of dnCaMKI and b PIX S516A Mutant on mEPSCs and mIPSCs Cultured neurons ( DIV 7 ) were transfected with EYFP - g actin and either mRFP ( controls ) , mRFP - dnCaMKI , or mRFP - b PIX S516A mutant , and mEPSCs and mIPSCs were recorded on DIV 12 .

Neuron Activity - Dependent Regulation of Synaptogenesis Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 101 GEF activity , similar effects on Cdc42 activation appear to occur ( Figure 3A ) . The essential features of this signaling pathway that regulates activity - dependent spine and synapse formation were demonstrated in both cultured hippocampal neurons and orga - notypic slices . This constitutes the ﬁrst report of a signaling complex involving the CaMKK / CaMKI cascade and identiﬁes a precise mechanism for activation of Rac1 by neuronal activity . Consistent with this pathway , caPak1 was able to rescue spine formation that had been suppressed by dnCaMKI and S516A b PIX ( Figure 5C ) . There are several signaling pathways down - stream of Pak1 ( e . g . , Lim - kinase [ Meng et al . , 2004 ; Schratt et al . , 2006 ] , myosin heavy - chain IIb [ Ryu et al . , 2006 ] ) that en - hance spine maturation through regulation of the actin cytoskel - eton ( Hayashi et al . , 2004 ; Luo et al . , 1996 ; Tashiro and Yuste , 2004 ) . Modulation of the b CaMKK / CaMKI pathway using phar - macological reagents , dominant - negative constructs , as well as siRNAs had corresponding effects on spine formation . Mush - room - shaped spines , identiﬁed by intense puncta of b actin in their heads , showed a strong correlation ( 97 % ) with the presyn - aptic marker synapsin 1 ( Figure 4A ) as well as colocalization with pCaMKI ( Figure 4B ) , indicating their presence in synapses . Thus , we conclude that this signaling pathway promotes not only spine formation but also synaptogenesis . Consistent with this conclu - sion , reductions in spine and synapse density ( Figure 5 ) corre - lated with reductions in mEPSC frequency with no effect on mIPSCs ( Figure 6 ) , remarkably similar to the phenotype of corti - cal neurons from the mouse model of Rett syndrome mental retardation ( Dani et al . , 2005 ) . The a , but not b or d , isoform of CaMKI appeared to be respon - sible for spinogenesis through phosphorylation of b PIX ; how - ever , we could not exclude a potential role for g CaMKI since Figure 8 . Model of CaMK / b PIX Signaling Pathway Activity - dependentCa 2 + inﬂuxthroughtheNMDAreceptorofaspineactivates the CaMKK / CaMKI / b PIX complex to promote CaMKI - mediated phosphoryl - ation of S516 in b PIX with resultant activation of its GEF activity . The activated b PIX promotes GTP - loading of Rac ( and / or Cdc42 ) to activate Pak and mod - ulate actin dynamics and enhance spinogenesis and synapse formation . Figure 7 . Regulation of Spinogenesis in Cultured Hippocampal Slices Hippocampal slices from P7 rats were cultured for 2 days , subjected to biolis - tic transfection with mRFP - actin ± other plasmids as indicated . Neurons were treated without or with pharmacological reagents ( 100 m M APV , 1 m M TTX , or 20 m M STO - 609 ) as indicated . On DIV 5 , dendritic protrusions were analyzed for spines and ﬁlopodia as in Figure 5 .

Neuron Activity - Dependent Regulation of Synaptogenesis 102 Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . its siRNA was deleterious to the cultured neurons . Is b PIX the only target of a CaMKI that modulates spinogenesis ? CaMKI can directly phosphorylate Ser19 in MLC in vitro and in trans - fected HeLa cells ( Suizu et al . , 2002 ) , and MLC phosphorylation by Pak1 has been reported to enhance spine formation ( Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . However , our data strongly support the conclusion that the major effect of endogenous b CaMKK / a CaMKI on spino - genesis is mediated largely through Ser516 phosphorylation in b PIX since the suppression of spine number and synapse forma - tion by dnCaMKI or by siRNA were essentially identical to expression of the S516A b PIX or the b PIX mutant lacking GEF activity ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . It is interesting that all the reagents that interfere with the CaMKK / CaMKI / b PIX pathway suppress formation of mush - room - shaped spines with little effect on ﬁlopodia number . The exception is the siRNA for b CaMKK that strongly decreased spine formation but also increased ﬁlopodia number ( Figure 4F ) . It seems likely that b CaMKK may be interfering with maturation of ﬁlopodia into mature spines , the major mechanism for spine formation and synaptogenesis ( Matus , 2000 ; Ziv and Smith , 1996 ) . This would be consistent with its colocalization with the b PIX / GIT1 complex that exists in spine heads ( Zhang et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . The siRNA for a CaMKK strongly reduced both spine and ﬁlopodia numbers . It is possible that a CaMKK may be regulating a different pathway that blocks formation or stabi - lization of ﬁlopodia that would not only reduce ﬁlopodia number but also spines because they mature from ﬁlopodia . Since a CaMKK only weakly interacts with b PIX , it is not clear how a CaMKK is exerting its effect . It may be targeting a different sub - cellular pool or isoform of CaMKI than the a CaMKI / b PIX com - plex , and mapping out this pathway will be a future endeavor . In - terfering with the CaMK / b PIX pathway reduced spine / synapse density , increased the length of remaining spines , but had no ef - fect on spine head width . Physiological consequences of in - creasing spine length are not obvious , but it might further reduce the limited Ca 2 + signaling from the spine head to the dendritic shaft ( Sabatini et al . , 2002 ) . Such signaling in short spines has been proposed to be important in trafﬁcking of AMPARs during certain forms of synaptic plasticity ( Korkotian and Segal , 2007 ) . b PIX and its binding partner GIT1 are both multidomain pro - teins ( Hoefen and Berk , 2006 ) that interact with numerous other proteins , such as hScrib ( Audebert et al . , 2004 ; Roche et al . , 2002 ) , piccolo ( Kim et al . , 2003 ) , liprin - a ( Kaufmann et al . , 2002 ; Wyszynski et al . , 1999 ) , and Shank ( Park et al . , 2003 ) , that are located both pre - and / or postsynaptically . Although it is likely that the b PIX / GIT1 complex may have presynaptic func - tions , the effects observed in this study are almost certainly post - synaptic . Our transfection efﬁciency of cultured neurons is very low ( 2 % – 5 % ) , so the probability that an axon from one trans - fected neuron forms a synapse with a spine from another trans - fected neuron is highly unlikely . Since b PIX regulates Rac , Cdc42 , and Pak1 activation , postsynaptic effects on the actin cytoskeleton of ﬁlopodia and spines are likely involved ( Calabr - ese et al . , 2006 ) . One reported mechanism is through Pak1 - mediated phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain ( Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . Myosin IIB is present in the postsynaptic density of spines ( Jordan et al . , 2004 ; Peng et al . , 2004 ) where it regulates spine morphology ( Ryu et al . , 2006 ) . It should be noted that expression of various constructs that inhibited either CaMKI or b PIX in our study gave about a 50 % de - crease in mushroom - shaped spines . However , suppression of by dominant - negative RacN17 produces an almost complete blockage of spinogenesis ( Nakayama et al . , 2000 ; Zhang and Macara , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . This suggests the existence of mechanisms in addition to CaMKK / CaMKI / b PIX for activity - dependent regulation of Rac . Another Ca 2 + - dependent mecha - nism is the Rac GEF Tiam which also is involved in NMDAR - dependent regulation of spine formation ( Tolias et al . , 2005 ) . Interference with endogenous Tiam using either siRNA or dnTiam ( Tolias et al . , 2005 ) or suppression of the Tiam - binding protein PAR - 3 ( Zhang and Macara , 2006 ) reduces spine density by 40 % – 60 % . NMDAR stimulation of Tiam GEF activity may be mediated by CaMKII - dependent phosphorylation of Tiam ( Flem - ing et al . , 1999 ) , but this pathway could not be directly veriﬁed because the CaMKII regulatory phosphorylation site in Tiam has not been identiﬁed . Since we identiﬁed Ser516 in b PIX as the CaMKI phosphorylation site ( Figure 2A ) , we were able to demonstrate that this speciﬁc phosphorylation enhanced b PIX GEF activity ( Figure 3 ) and was critical in the regulation of spino - genesis ( Figure 5 ) . Thus , multiple signaling pathways involving CaMKK / CaMKI / b PIX , Tiam , and PAR3 all appear to modulate Rac - mediated spinogenesis . Since abnormalities in Rho - medi - ated spinogenesis are closely linked to several forms of mental retardation ( Kaufmann and Moser , 2000 ; van Galen and Ram - akers , 2005 ) , it will be important to determine whether the CaMKK / CaMKI / b PIX pathway is perturbed in any of these neuropathologies . The present work adds to the growing list of functions for the CaMKK / CaMKI pathway in neuronal development and plasticity by demonstrating its ability to activate the Rac GEF b PIX and thereby promote activity - dependent maturation of spines and synapses . Previously , we showed that CaMKK / CaMKI is essen - tial for maintaining the morphology and motility of axonal growth cones and therefore basal axonal outgrowth ( Wayman et al . , 2004 ) . Because CaMKK / CaMKI exerts Ca 2 + - dependent cross - talk with the MAP - kinase Erk ( Schmitt et al . , 2004 ) , this signaling pathway accounts for Erk - mediated LTP ( Schmitt et al . , 2005 ) as well as for activity - dependent dendritic arborization ( Wayman et al . , 2006 ) . These multiple functions , however , appear to be mediated by different CaMKI isoforms . For example , regulation of Erk activation and CREB - dependent dendritic arborization is mediated by the g isoform of CaMKI , whereas the current study implicated b CaMKK acting through a CaMKI . In summary , over the past couple years CaMKI has been transformed from an ‘‘orphan’’ kinase of unknown physiological function to a major player in neuronal development and plasticity .

Neurons were maintained in Neurobasal A media ( Invitrogen ) supple - mented with B27 ( Invitrogen ) and 0 . 5 mM L - glutamine with 5 m M cytosine - D - arabinofuranoside ( AraC ) added at 2 DIV . Neurons were cultured a further 5 days before transfection ( LipofectAMINE 2000 , Invitrogen ) and / or treatment with various pharmacological reagents as speciﬁed . In each experiment , we optimized DNA amounts , transfection reagent amounts , and transfection du - ration to minimize toxicity and maximize transfection efﬁciency . None of the transfections or drug treatments described in this work had noticeable effects on apoptosis as assessed by condensed nuclei using Hoechst staining . HEK293 from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum , penicillin / streptomycin , and L - glutamine at 37 (cid:3) C in 5 % CO 2 , 95 % air . HEK293 cells were transfected with Fugene6 ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Organotypic hippocampal slices were prepared from P7 Sprague - Dawley rats as described previously ( Wayman et al . , 2006 ) . To visualize transfected neurons and dendritic protrutions , slices were transfected with pCAGGS - mRFP1 - b actin and pCAG - EGFP plus test plasmids using a Helios Gene Gun ( Bio - Rad ) at DIV2 . At 4 days posttransfection , slices were ﬁxed , mounted , and imaged using a confocal microscope .

Fluorescent images were acquired using a cooled CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Shizuoka , Japan ) attached to aZeissAxiplan2 ( CarlZeiss , Inc . ) invertedmicroscopewitha63 3 oilimmersion lens . Morphometric measurements were performed using Openlab software ( Improvision Inc . ) . For protrusion density , the number of protrusions were counted from 15 – 30 neurons ( (cid:4) 200 m m total dendritic length per neuron ) .

Electrophysiology Whole - cell voltage clamp recordings were performed on cultured hippocam - pal neurons using an Axopatch - 200b ampliﬁer ( Molecular Devices ) . Cells were perfused ( 1 ml min (cid:2) 1 ) with perfusate containing 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 3 mM CaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM HEPES , and 25 mM D - glucose ( pH = 7 . 3 ; 310 mosmol l (cid:2) 1 ) . Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mEPSCs ) were isolated by adding picrotoxin ( 50 m M ) , strychnine ( 1 m M ) , and tetrodotoxin ( 0 . 5 m M ) to the bath perfusate while 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2 , 3 - dione ( CNQX , 10 m M , Tocris ) and D - ( - ) - 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoic acid ( D - AP5 , 50 m M , Tocris ) were added toisolateminiature inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( mIPSCs ) . Patch electrodes ( 4 – 6 M U ) contained 100 mM CsCH 3 O 3 S , 25 mM CsCl , 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 4 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM Na 2 - ATP , 0 . 4mMNa - GTP , and10mMphosphocreatine ( pH = 7 . 3 ; 290 – 300mosmoll (cid:2) 1 ) . All experiments were carried out at room temperature ( 21 (cid:3) C ) . Transfected cells were identiﬁed under epiﬂuorescence . Only cells that had an input resis - tance > 200 M U and resting membrane potentials < (cid:2) 50mV were considered for experiments . Access resistance ( R a ) typically ranged between 10 and 15 M U and was compensated by R 60 % . Cells were rejected from analysis if R a increased by more than 15 % , or if the input resistance fell below 200 M U . Off - line analysis of mEPCSs was carried out using Clampﬁt v9 . 01 . 07 ( Molecular Devices ) . FRET Assay Hippocampal neurons were transfected on DIV 4 with vectors encoding Raichu - rac ( 1011X ) with or without wild - type or S516A b PIX mutant ( 1 : 5 ratio ) and incubated 3 days at 37 (cid:3) C . Cells were washed and preincubated in ASCF containing B27 supplement , FK506 ( 1 m M ) , cyclopsoprine A ( 1 m g / ml ) . Fluores - cencefromRaichu - racwasimagedandmeasuredusinganAxiovert135TVmi - croscope ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging , Inc . ) through an oil immersion objective ( Plan - Apochromat63 3 / 1 . 4 ) equipped withcascadeII : 512 camera ( Roper Bio - science ) controlled byMetaMorph 6 . 3 ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) and alambda 10 - 2 ﬁlter wheel ( Sutter Instrument ) . The dual - emission images were obtained simultaneously through a dual - view module ( Roper Bioscience ) mounted with S470 / 30andS535 / 30emissionﬁltersanda505dcxrdichroicmirror ( Chroma ) . Cellswereilluminatedwitha75WXenonlampthroughD436 / 10and12 . 5 % ND ﬁlterorHQ500 / 20and1 . 25 % NDﬁlter . Theexposuretimewas100ms , andim - ageswere takenevery10s . Sensitized FRET ( F sen ) was calculated asreported elsewhere ( van Rheenen et al . , 2004 ) . Brieﬂy , after background subtraction , F sen was calculated using ﬂuorescent intensities from three images ( M donor , M indirectAcceptor , M directAcceptor ) using the following equation : F sen = ð M indirectAcceptor (cid:2) M donor (cid:5) b (cid:2) M directAcceptor (cid:5) ð g (cid:2) ab ÞÞ (cid:2) ð 1 (cid:2) bd Þ Neuron Activity - Dependent Regulation of Synaptogenesis 104 Neuron 57 , 94 – 107 , January 10 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . Apparent FRET efﬁciency ( E A ) was obtained by dividing F sen by M directAcceptor . Note that we used ten times less illumination for M directAcceptor , which is com - pensated with a scale factor ( S ) . E A = S (cid:5) F sen = M directAcceptor Constants for the equation were obtained by independent control experi - ments : a = 5 . 6 3 10 (cid:2) 5 , b = 0 . 628 , g = 0 . 147 , d = 3 . 7 3 10 (cid:2) 4 , and S = 0 . 1 , re - spectively . Cells were stimulated two minutes after recording . E A changes are shown after normalization . For each image set , the E A values before the stimulation were averaged and used as the reference value for normalization . Signals from 2 – 4 dendrite shafts were measured per cell and averaged values were used to represent single - cell responses . Statistic To determine whether signiﬁcant differences existed among treatments , an analysis of variance was performed on the data with signiﬁcance set at 0 . 05 . To compare whether signiﬁcant differences existed between two treatments , a Student’s t test was performed on the data with signiﬁcance set at 0 . 05 . Signiﬁcance levels ( p value ) are indicated in the ﬁgures . Antibodies , Plasmids , and Other Reagents These are available online in the Supplemental Data .
