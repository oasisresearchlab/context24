The idea , that lipids segregate in biological membranes to form liquid - disordered and liquid - ordered states , was faced with a challenge : to show that lipid - ordered domains , enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol , actually exist in vivo . A great deal of indirect evidence and the use of lipid - binding probes supported this idea , but there was a lack of tools to demonstrate the existence of such domains in living cells . A whole new toolbox had to be invented to biochemically characterize lipid rafts and to deﬁne how they are involved in several cellular functions . A potential solution came from basic biochemical experiments in the late 1970s , showing that some mushroom extracts exert hemolytic activities . These activities were later assigned to aegerolysin - based sphingomyelin / cholesterol - speciﬁc cytolytic protein complexes . Recently , six sphingomyelin / cholesterol binding proteins from different mushrooms have been identiﬁed and have provided some insight into the nature of sphingomyelin / cholesterol - rich domains in living vertebrate cells . In this review , we dissect the accumulated knowledge and introduce the mushroom lipid raft binding proteins as molecules of choice to study the dynamics and origins of these liquid - ordered domains in mammalian cells .

Introduction The plasma membrane of cells is a proteolipid bilayer that protects cells from their environment [ 1 , 2 ] . More than 10 , 000 different lipids and proteins have been identiﬁed in plasma membranes [ 3 ] , with a high level of complexity seen for eukaryotic cells [ 4 ] . The plasma membrane was ﬁrst described according to the ﬂuid mosaic model [ 5 ] , where the lipids and proteins have no restrictions on their mobility . Later , lateral membrane domains with different structures and characteristics were proposed [ 6 ] , with one of the most studied of these domains known as “lipid rafts” [ 7 – 12 ] . These deﬁned clusters are enriched in cholesterol ( Chol ) , sphingolipids , and speciﬁc proteins that can diffuse within the membrane bilayer . Lipid rafts have been indicated to play important roles in endocytosis , exocytosis , membrane transport , host – pathogen interactions , cell signaling , cancer , immune response , cardiovascular diseases , and in many other cellular functions in health and disease [ 6 , 11 , 13 – 18 ] . These raft domains exist in a liquid - ordered phase ( l o ) , and they are surrounded by lipids in a liquid - disordered ( l d ) , or crystalline phase . The l o state means that although the molecules are highly condensed , they can physically exchange their position within the l o complex and with the molecules in the l d phase [ 19 ] . However , it is very difﬁcult to deﬁne raft domains in the plasma membrane , as they are of nanoscale size with a life - time in the order of milliseconds [ 20 , 21 ] . To gain a better understanding of the raft theory , the quest for an appropriate detection technique is important . Soon after the raft hypothesis was proposed in 1997 , diverse methodologies were used for their characterization . One of the ﬁrst approaches was based on their isolation at Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / membranes11040264 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / membranes Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 2 of 16 low temperatures using detergents , as these domains in the l o phase were considered as detergent - resistant membranes . However , such detergent - resistant membranes can only exist after detergent treatment of the membrane , and therefore , it would not be correct to refer to lipid rafts as detergent - resistant membranes . Additionally , it has not been shown that all such raft domains are detergent resistant [ 22 , 23 ] . An alternative approach to demonstrate the existence of lipid rafts and to study them further , is to promote their assembly . Raft domains in mammalian plasma membranes are formed in the presence of at least 25 mol % Chol at 37 ◦ C . Therefore , with depletion of membrane Chol using methyl - β - cyclodextrin , some information about membrane domain structure before and after raft disruption can be gained [ 22 ] . However , as the depletion of Chol can affect many processes in the cell , modifying the Chol content to study lipid rafts does not seem to be the most appropriate method [ 16 ] . Fluorescent lipid probes that speciﬁcally sense a particular membrane lipid phase and partition within it , represent an important class of tools for the visualization of raft domains in natural and artiﬁcial membranes [ 22 ] . Although their contributions to lipid raft research have been substantial , the use of ﬂuorescent lipid probes in living cells needs to be carefully evaluated . The most common probes can be misleading ; as compared to an unlabeled lipid , a ﬂuorescently labeled lipid might partition into both the l o and l d domains , or might even partition into a different domain . Nitrobenzoxadiazole - and 4 , 4 - diﬂuoro - 4 - bora - 3a , 4a - diaza - s - indacene ( BODIPY ) - labeled sphingomyelin ( SM ) , for example , has been shown to partition into the l d phase , although natural SM partitions into the l o phase [ 24 ] . The lipid probes that are known as environment - sensitive dyes ( e . g . , molecular rotors , solvatochromic and electrochromic dyes ) can partition into both lipid phases , and as they react to the properties of the individual phase , they can allow for direct recognition of these phases by ﬂuorescence ratiometric imaging . However , these dyes have not been well explored to date [ 25 ] . Alternatively , lipid - speciﬁc / sensing molecules can be used , such as the polyene macrolide antibiotic ﬁlipin , which interacts speciﬁcally with 3 β - OH sterols and , thus , can be used as a Chol marker . However , its use has some disadvantages , as it disrupts lipid rafts and has poor ﬂuorescence properties [ 26 ] . Using hydrophobic probes for staining lipids in natural membranes can also be difﬁcult in terms of interpretation . Due to their high migration properties , these probes rapidly stain all intracellular lipid compartments , so they are not the most appropriate for live - cell imaging [ 27 ] . In this regard , proteins that target speciﬁc raft - enriched molecules might represent a better option [ 27 ] . For many years , cholera toxin B subunit ( CT - B ) has been widely used for detecting lipid rafts [ 28 – 30 ] , and it has provided important insights into membrane trafﬁcking . CT - B speciﬁcally binds to the raft - residing ganglioside GM1 . Once internalized , the cholera toxin moves to the trans Golgi network and then to the endoplasmic reticulum . It is either recycled between the Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum or passes into the cytosol , where its A subunit can induce toxicity [ 31 ] . However , the use of CT - B for lipid raft detection also has some disadvantages . These include the nonspeciﬁc binding of CT - B to glycans at the cell surface and the induction of local rearrangements of cell membranes after binding to the GM1 receptor , with the consequent formation of lipid domains [ 32 , 33 ] . Finally , some mammalian cells are depleted in , or have undetectable amounts of GM1 , so they cannot be probed by CT - B [ 27 , 34 , 35 ] . Recently , nontoxic mushroom proteins and their ﬂuorescently labeled derivatives have become a tool of choice for the visualization of SM / Chol - rich raft domains in living and ﬁxed mammalian cells . These interesting mushroom proteins are relatively small ( 15 – 22 kDa ) and acidic ( pI , 4 . 8 – 6 . 2 ) , and have also been proposed to be useful in many biotechnological applications ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . The SM / Chol - binding proteins from the genus Pleurotus ( aegerolysins ) act as cytolytic proteins when in concert with a partner protein with a membrane attack complex - perforin ( MACPF ) domain . However , this is not the case for nakanori , which is a lipid raft sensing protein from the mushroom Grifola frondosa ( Table 1 ) . These proteins were the ﬁrst—and to date , they remain the only— molecules that simultaneously bind only to mixtures of the most abundant raft lipids , SM Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 3 of 16 and Chol , and not to individual molecules of these two lipid species [ 28 , 36 – 40 ] . Their speciﬁc binding to SM / Chol - rich membrane domains was also demonstrated using in vitro cell models with co - localization studies with endogenous raftophylic proteins ( Table 2 ) . As with every raft probe mentioned so far , raft sensing proteins from mushrooms also have some disadvantages . As discussed further in the text , aegerolysin - based probes might induce the unwanted vesiculation of cells if used in exaggerated concentrations , as discussed in Section 2 . 2 . Table 1 .

The differences between these two types of SM / Chol - sensing proteins , Pleurotus aegerolysins and nakanori , are observed also at higher levels of protein structure , where aegerolysins are mainly β - structured , while nakanori is mainly composed of α - helices ( Figure 1B ) .

Ostreolysin A In 2002 , a 15 kDa protein ostreolysin ( OlyA , also Oly ) was purified from the edible mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus [ 51 ] . OlyA belongs to the aegerolysin family of proteins that are found in several mushrooms , molds , plants , and bacteria [ 41 , 52 ] . Early experiments with isolated native OlyA showed that it has a low isoelectric point , and it is thermolabile and cytotoxic to erythrocytes and several cell lines [ 36 , 53 – 55 ] . It is expressed during the formation of primordia ( an organ or tissue in its earliest recognizable stage of develop - ment ) and fruiting bodies ( a macroscopic reproductive structure produced by some fungi ) of the oyster mushroom , and therefore , it was believed to have a role in mushroom fruit - ing [ 51 , 53 ] . In 2004 , it was discovered that OlyA recognizes and permeabilizes membranes rich in Chol ( > 30 mol % ) and SM [ 36 ] , and that binding is abolished after methyl - β - cy - clodextrin pre - treatment of the cells [ 45 ] . However , it was later discovered that this native isolate was contaminated with traces of another protein , pleurotolysin B ( PlyB ) [ 42 ] , which accounted for the observed cytolytic effects , as described in the next section . 2 . 2 . Ostreolysin A6 In 2013 , it was discovered that the genome of P . ostreatus has several genes that en - code different aegerolysins . One of these was expressed and the corresponding aegeroly - sin showed 78 % amino acid identity with OlyA ( Figure 1 ) , and was named as ostreolysin A6 ( OlyA6 ) . OlyA6 was expressed in a recombinant form and was shown to be nonlytic by itself . Sedimentation assays and surface plasmon resonance revealed that OlyA6 is re - sponsible for the recognition of and interaction with SM / Chol - rich artificial lipid mem - branes and with natural membranes with SM / Chol - rich microdomains . Recently , it was confirmed that OlyA6 binds specifically to SM / Chol complexes , and not to free SM , and that this specificity is controlled by a single glutamic acid residue near the binding pocket Figure 1 .

However , it was later discovered that this native isolate was contaminated with traces of another protein , pleurotolysin B ( PlyB ) [ 42 ] , which accounted for the observed cytolytic effects , as described in the next section . 2 . 2 . Ostreolysin A6 In 2013 , it was discovered that the genome of P . ostreatus has several genes that encode different aegerolysins . One of these was expressed and the corresponding aegerolysin showed 78 % amino acid identity with OlyA ( Figure 1 ) , and was named as ostreolysin A6 ( OlyA6 ) . OlyA6 was expressed in a recombinant form and was shown to be nonlytic by itself . Sedimentation assays and surface plasmon resonance revealed that OlyA6 is respon - sible for the recognition of and interaction with SM / Chol - rich artiﬁcial lipid membranes Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 5 of 16 and with natural membranes with SM / Chol - rich microdomains . Recently , it was conﬁrmed that OlyA6 binds speciﬁcally to SM / Chol complexes , and not to free SM , and that this speciﬁcity is controlled by a single glutamic acid residue near the binding pocket [ 56 ] . Moreover , it appears that OlyA6 traps and stabilizes these complexes , which allows direct measurements of their levels . As its lipid - binding characteristics indicated that OlyA6 can be used as a new raft marker , Skoˇcaj et al . produced a ﬂuorescent fusion protein OlyA – mCherry [ 37 , 42 ] . Sur - face plasmon resonance revealed that OlyA6 – mCherry has essentially the same binding characteristics as nonlabelled recombinant OlyA6 . Labeling of SM / Chol domains in the plasma membrane of live and ﬁxed MDCK ( Madin - Darby Canine Kidney ) cells with 1 µ M OlyA6 – mCherry did not induce cell lysis . As for the isolated native OlyA [ 45 ] , this binding was abolished by methyl - β - cyclodextrin or sphingomyelinase pretreatment . Interestingly , the labeling of MDCK cells with OlyA6 – mCherry induced formation of vesicles of 2 µ m to 10 µ m in diameter when longer incubation times or higher protein concentrations were used [ 46 ] . The same was seen in studies with artiﬁcial large unilamellar vesicles composed of extracted total erythrocyte lipids or SM / Chol in a 1 : 1 molar ratio [ 42 ] , and with Chinese hamster ovary cells [ 57 ] , neuroblastoma NG108 - 15 cells [ 58 ] and different types of blood cells [ 46 ] . This vesiculation was not surprising , as similar observations had been reported for the Chol - binding toxin streptolysin O , and were explained as a physical effect of the protein binding to the membrane and not as a result of apoptosis [ 59 ] . Alternatively , clus - tering of OlyA6 molecules might induce locally imposed membrane curvature that can lead to vesicle formation . These vesicles induced by OlyA6 – mCherry binding contained several cytoplasmic proteins and were proposed to be used for sampling of the cytosolic content , or as model plasma membrane vesicles [ 46 ] . Co - localization studies showed that CT - B labels different domains compared to OlyA6 , which conﬁrmed that raft domains are highly heterogeneous ( Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , when OlyA6 – mCherry was expressed in MDCK cells , it did not bind to intracellular membranes . The reason for this might be the lower content of SM in membranes exposed to cytosol , as needed for OlyA6 – mCherry binding . OlyA6 – mCherry was also used to study caveolin - dependent internalization pathways of raft membranes , as it internalizes via caveolae , and can be detected near the Golgi complex after 90 min [ 37 ] . CT - B , in contrast , follows a different pathway to reach the Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum [ 60 ] . These internalization studies led to the conclusion that OlyA6 – mCherry can be used as a tool for delivering pharmacologically active substances to speciﬁc intracellular compartments [ 37 ] .

Furthermore , it was shown that OlyA6 acts in concert with PlyB , which is also pro - duced by P . ostreatus , as a 59 kDa protein that has an MACPF domain . OlyA6 and PlyB form a cytolytic complex , where OlyA6 serves as the binding component and recruits PlyB to the membrane surface , which leads to the formation of 13 - meric transmembrane pores [ 42 , 61 ] . In combination with PlyB , OlyA6 can be used to selectively eliminate cells with more SM / Chol domains ; e . g . , in some cancer cell types [ 47 ] . OlyA6 / PlyB complexes have been demonstrated to be good candidates in the search for a cure for bladder cancer . Pre - treatment of low - grade human papillary cancer cells and high - grade invasive human urothelial cancer cells with high concentrations of OlyA6 / PlyB decreased cell viability and resulted in cell necrosis . Compared to nontransformed normal urothelial cells , the Chol concentrations in both of these transformed cell lines were higher , and therefore , the cy - totoxic effects were only seen in the cancer cells . Metastatic urothelial carcinomas can be resistant to chemotherapy , and therefore , the OlyA6 / PlyB complex has become a very in - teresting tool for a potential cure for this type of cancer [ 47 ] . Recently , it was revealed that OlyA6 has another high affinity lipid receptor , ceramide phosphoethanolamine ( CPE ) , which is present at very low levels in mammals , but is the main sphingolipid in invertebrate cell membranes [ 62 ] . OlyA6 shows 1000 - fold stronger binding to CPE / Chol lipid vesicles than to SM / Chol [ 63 ] . Moreover , OlyA6 binds Figure 2 . Distribution of OlyA – mCherry and established lipid raft markers .

Metastatic urothelial carcinomas can be resistant to chemotherapy , and therefore , the OlyA6 / PlyB complex has become a very interesting tool for a potential cure for this type of cancer [ 47 ] . Recently , it was revealed that OlyA6 has another high afﬁnity lipid receptor , ceramide phosphoethanolamine ( CPE ) , which is present at very low levels in mammals , but is the main sphingolipid in invertebrate cell membranes [ 62 ] . OlyA6 shows 1000 - fold stronger binding to CPE / Chol lipid vesicles than to SM / Chol [ 63 ] . Moreover , OlyA6 binds strongly to equimolar 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine / Chol vesicles supplemented with less than 5 mol % CPE [ 64 ] . This discovery led to the consideration that OlyA6 Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 7 of 16 can also be used as a CPE marker in insect cells and tissues [ 63 – 65 ] . Additionally , the permeabilization effects of OlyA6 / PlyB complexes have been shown for artiﬁcial lipid systems with CPE , and Sf9 cells and larvae of selected insect pests . OlyA6 / PlyB complexes ( molar ratio , 12 . 5 : 1 ) permeabilize lipid vesicles with < 5 mol % CPE and are toxic to Sf9 cells , and to Western corn rootworm and Colorado potato beetle larvae [ 64 ] . Thus , OlyA6 / PlyB complexes have been proposed as new environmentally friendly bioinsecticides [ 64 , 66 ] . Furthermore , it is highly likely that mushrooms use aegerolysin proteins together with their MACPF - protein partners as defense mechanisms against environmental pests in their natural habitats . Taken together , recombinant OlyA6 is an important tool to study SM / Chol domains in mammalian cells [ 37 , 56 , 57 ] . It is a small and stable protein , and it is not toxic for vertebrate cells [ 37 , 64 ] . OlyA6 has revealed a heterogenic pool of membrane domains , and it has been shown to be appropriate for studying the turnover of lipid rafts in living mammalian cells [ 37 ] . 2 . 3 . rOlyA Oyster mushrooms are recognized as having high medicinal value [ 67 ] . Recently , a new aegerolysin , produced by P . ostreatus ( in recombinant form ) , was shown to have anti - cancer activity , and can also be used to ﬁght obesity . This aegerolysin was ﬁrst produced in 2017 , and it was named recombinant ostreolysin ( rOly ) [ 43 ] . rOly is almost identical to OylA6 ( Figure 1 ) , but it has one amino acid substitution ( valine to isoleucine ) at position 50 . rOly has not been used as a lipid raft marker , but it was suggested that its SM / Chol binding characteristics are responsible for its anti - proliferative , pro - apoptotic effects against colon cancer cells , and for the treatment of metabolic disorders , as summarized in the following paragraphs [ 43 , 48 , 49 ] . Recombinant Oly induces apoptosis of human and mouse colon cancer cells in vitro , as these cells are enriched in lipid rafts . After endocytosis , membrane - bound rOly promotes programmed cell death in colon cancer cells in a dose - dependent manner , which was not signiﬁcant in a normal intestinal cell line . After internalization , rOlyA co - localizes with β - III tubulin , and it was suggested that this interaction , which affects microtubule dynamics , leads to apoptosis . The anticancer potential of rOlyA was also conﬁrmed in vivo in mouse models , where rOly reduced tumor growth by modulation of signal - transduction pathways , and thus , effects on inﬂammatory processes and decreased angiogenesis [ 43 ] . In contrast to OlyA6 , which shows anticancer activity against bladder cancer cells in vitro when applied in combination with PlyB , rOlyA has antitumor activity without its MACPF protein partner . Recombinant Oly has also been shown to be an interesting candidate for combating obesity and other metabolic disorders . There are two types of adipocytes in mammals ( i . e . , white and brown ) . The white adipocytes serve for storage of energy in the form of fat . Increased numbers of these cells can lead to obesity or to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease if stored in the liver , which can result in insulin insensitivity . Brown adipocytes contain more mitochondria , which can produce more heat and less ATP as a result of uncoupling protein activity [ 48 , 49 ] . Higher numbers of brown adipocytes are , therefore , favorable against obesity . White preadipocytes are enriched in lipid rafts , which correlates with their sensitivity to aegerolysin treatment [ 68 ] . Recombinant Oly induces “browning” of adipocytes in vitro , as shown by increased brown - adipocyte - speciﬁc markers . As a result , the brown fat - like phenotype of in vitro adipocytes increases the activation of mitochondria and mitochondrial biogenesis , including the expression of thermogenic markers and inhibition of inﬂammation . In vivo studies have demonstrated that rOly can dramatically reverse accumulation of fat in the liver , suppress de novo lipogenesis , and reduce glycolysis and hepatic inﬂammation . As a result , serum levels of free fatty acids in mice on a high fat diet treated with rOly were lower than in untreated mice . rOly has , therefore , been proposed as an appropriate candidate for treatment of metabolic disorders , such as obesity , hyperlipidemia , and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease .

Pleurotolysin A Then , in 1979 , the 15 kDa protein pleurotolysin ( Ply ) was isolated from P . ostreatus and was shown to have hemolytic activity towards mammalian erythrocytes . Initial investigations with erythrocytes from various animals showed the importance of SM for Ply binding [ 69 ] . In 2004 , a native cytolysin was isolated , and as in the case of Oly , it was shown to be composed of A and B subunits . The A subunit ( PlyA ) is a 15 kDa aegerolysin that binds to membranes , and in combination with the 59 kDa MACPF - domain - containing component B ( PlyB ) , it forms transmembrane pores [ 50 ] . The primary structure of PlyA is 79 % and 94 % identical to OlyA and OlyA6 , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . While studies of OlyA6 were more cell - labeling oriented , PlyA studies have focused on the structure and mechanism of PlyA binding to target membranes . The crystal structure of PlyA was obtained by a combination of X - ray diffraction and cryo - electron microscopy , and this showed that PlyA has a β - sandwich structure similar to the actinoporin family of pore - forming toxins [ 70 ] . The N - terminal region , which is responsible for pore formation in actinoporins [ 71 ] , is absent in PlyA ; therefore , similarly to OlyA6 , PlyA cannot form transmembrane pores by itself [ 50 ] . PlyA binds speciﬁcally to SM / Chol - rich membranes , which was demonstrated for liposomes with different compositions . The binding was detected only with SM / Chol liposomes and not where SM was replaced with glycerophospholipid species [ 50 ] . One explanation of the importance of SM might lie in the PlyA structure ; there are a few negatively charged amino acids in a region that is similar to a region in Asp - hemolysin , the ﬁrst of the isolated aegerolysin - like protein from the ﬁlamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus [ 44 , 72 ] . These residues were proposed to be responsible for identiﬁcation of choline . Analysis of the secondary structure of PlyA also indicated that the N - terminal part of 14 amino acids can interact with the hydrophobic part of the membranes through its β - sheet [ 44 ] . This could be linked to the same binding pocket present in both OlyA6 and PlyA , which is responsible for recognizing the speciﬁc conformation of SM in SM / Chol complexes . Thus , PlyA can also distinguish between SM conformations and has very similar binding properties to OlyA6 . For PlyA binding , the Chol content should be ≥ 30 mol % Chol . As for OlyA6 , PlyA can form pores in artiﬁcial membranes and cell membranes when PlyB is present [ 50 ] . Two PlyA monomers bind to the membrane to form a V - shaped dimer , which is then recognized by PlyB . After the conformational change of PlyB and insertion of β - hairpins through the membrane , the 13 - fold pore is formed with the membrane - inserted β - barrel [ 70 ] . It has been suggested that the optimal molar PlyA : PlyB ratio for pore formation is 3 : 1 . 2 . 5 . Pleurotolysin A2 Sedimentation assays with an extract from the mushroom P . eryngii gave rise to identiﬁcation of another protein that bound to SM / Chol liposomes . This protein was shown to be a PlyA ortholog by Bhat et al . [ 38 ] , so they named it pleurotolysin A2 ( PlyA2 ) . Similar to OlyA6 and PlyA , PlyA2 belongs to the aegerolysin protein family [ 38 ] and was shown to be a 15 kDa polypeptide . Compared to PlyA , PlyA2 has two amino acid substitutions [ 73 ] , while it shares 93 % amino acid sequence identity with OlyA6 [ 38 ] . As PlyA2 speciﬁcally recognizes SM / Chol - rich membrane domains , it also became interesting as a potential lipid raft marker . The binding properties of recombinant PlyA2 fused with EGFP ( Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein ) at the C - terminus ( PlyA2 - EGFP ) were tested on artiﬁcial and natural membranes . PlyA2 - EGFP bound to liposomes com - posed of SM / Chol ( 1 : 1 molar ratio ) , and this binding was abolished if Chol or SM were excluded from the liposomes , which indicated the importance of the presence of both SM and Chol [ 38 ] . As in the case of OlyA [ 74 ] , alterations in the A and B rings of the sterol appear to be important for PlyA2 binding , whereas modiﬁcations of the sterol hydrocar - bon side - chain do not inﬂuence the binding . The binding of PlyA2 is , therefore , mostly restricted to the head - group of the complex of SM and sterol [ 38 ] . Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 9 of 16 In addition , the binding and toxicity properties of PlyA2 and PlyA2 - EGFP were examined with natural membranes . When different concentrations of these proteins were incubated for 30 min with sheep erythrocytes , no hemolytic effects were seen [ 38 ] . As in the case of OlyA6 – mCherry in living MDCK cells [ 37 , 64 ] , incubation of Hela cells with PlyA2 - EGFP [ 38 ] showed successful labeling , with no toxicity . Similarly , the binding of PlyA2 - EGFP to HeLa cells was abolished after pretreatment with sphingomyelinase or methyl - β - cyclodextrin . This indicated that PlyA2 - EGFP is a suitable marker of SM / Chol - rich membrane domains . Co - localization studies were performed to analyze the surface distribution of PlyA2 - EGFP compared to other raft markers ( Figure 3 ) . PlyA2 - EGFP showed 45 % co - localization with the raft - associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein CD59 . After permeabilization by freezing and thawing ( to avoid lipid loss ) , the EGFP signal was detected in late endosomes [ 38 ] . Similar to OlyA6 – mCherry [ 37 ] , PlyA2 - EGFP did not label the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the cells [ 38 ] . Membranes 2021 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 16 appear to be important for PlyA2 binding , whereas modifications of the sterol hydrocar - bon side - chain do not influence the binding .

Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 10 of 16 However , PlyA - EGFP was later shown to have another lipid receptor with higher afﬁnity , as reported for OlyA6 . PlyA - EGFP binds to CPE / Chol membranes and can also recognize and bind to Chol - free CPE . PlyA2 - EGFP successfully labeled CPE in Kc167 embryonic Drosophila cells , and in the larvae of the same insect [ 63 ] . Panevska et al . [ 64 ] suggested that PlyA2 / PlyB complexes can be used as new bioinsecticides , as discussed for OlyA6 / PlyB complexes . 2 . 6 . Nakanori The most recent SM / Chol binding protein is nakanori ( “mid - raft rider” in Japanese ) . It was isolated from the edible mushroom Grifola frondosa in 2017 . In contrast to OlyA , OlyA6 , rOlyA , PlyA , and PlyA2 , it does not belong to the aegerolysin protein family . The globular structure of this protein is different from the aegerolysin fold . Nakanori is composed of antiparallel β - strands , and it has two helical regions . Topologically , nakanori shows similarities to the actinoporin protein family , although these proteins share only 17 % sequence identity . The additional 30 residues at the N - terminus and the lack of amphipathic character of helix 3 might be responsible for the nonlytic character of this protein [ 40 ] . The 23 kDa nakanori protein binds strongly to SM / Chol liposomes with > 20 mol % Chol , and not to other phospholipid / Chol mixtures . If Chol is substituted with ergosterol , binding of nakanori can still be detected , but the membrane binding is abolished with epic - holesterol and cholesteryl acetate . This suggests that the 3 β - hydroxyl function is important for nakanori binding . To clarify whether nakanori binds to pre - existing SM / Chol com - plexes or induces complex formation , sedimentation assays were performed with ternary mixtures of SM / 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine / Chol and SM / 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine / Chol . As the increasing content of 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine markedly reduced the binding of nakanori , and the presence of 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine reduced the binding only moderately ( which is consistent with the preferred association of Chol with SM over 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ) , the conclusion was that nakanori does not induce the formation of lipid domains by itself . Measurements with a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring ( QCM - D ) for binding afﬁnity deﬁned the dissociation constant K D of recombinant nakanori to liposomes composed of SM / Chol ( 1 : 1 , molar ratio ) [ 40 ] , which is stronger than those for OlyA6 and PlyA2 [ 38 ] ( Table 2 ) . Fluorescently labeled nakanori ( nakanori - EGFP ) was not toxic for HeLa cells , and treat - ment with sphingomyelinase and methyl - β - cyclodextrin abolish the binding of both labeled and nonlabeled nakanori . The intracellular labeling of HeLa cells showed that nakanori co - localizes with the SM - binding protein lysenin , and also with bis ( monoacylglycero ) phosphate / lysobisphosphatidic acid , CD63 and Lamp1 , which are enriched in the internal membranes of late endosomes [ 75 , 76 ] ( Figure 4 ) . Nakanori did not co - localize with markers of early endosomes , the Golgi complex , or the endoplasmic reticulum [ 40 ] .

Membranes 2021 , 11 , 264 12 of 16 During the later stages or during the entire time of an infection , the addition of higher concentrations of nakanori inhibited the release of the virus from MDCK cells . This indi - cates the importance of speciﬁc membrane domains and targeting of these domains in the development of anti - viral drugs [ 40 ] . Considering all of the data presented here , we can conclude that nakanori can be used to detect SM / Chol domains , in addition to altered distributions of lipid domains in some diseases . It has also become interesting as a potential probe for targeting lipid domains in anti - viral treatments . 3 . Conclusions The lipid raft hypothesis met some challenges at ﬁrst , but now it appears to be largely accepted and supported , although some questions still remain unresolved [ 3 , 12 , 77 ] . Lipid rafts have important roles in many pathologies , including : Alzheimer ' s disease ; Parkinson ' s disease ; cardiovascular , prion and immune diseases ; in addition to HIV . Therefore , lipid raft domains have become an interesting target in the search for a prevention and cure for such diseases [ 4 , 11 , 18 ] . Lipid raft domains cannot be easily detected as they have a size below optical resolu - tion and they are heterogeneous and have a short life - time [ 20 , 21 ] . Many protein - based probes have been developed to visualize lipid rafts [ 20 , 78 , 79 ] , but which one to use requires careful consideration . Some probes , such as CT - B , can induce rearrangements of mem - brane domains after binding , and / or clustering of different raft components [ 80 ] . Nonlytic ﬂuorescently labeled proteins from some mushrooms might represent suitable tools for lipid raft domain visualization in living and ﬁxed cells . OlyA , OlyA6 , rOlyA , PlyA from P . ostreatus , PlyA2 from P . eryngii , and nakanori from G . frondosa have high speciﬁcities for mammalian cell membranes , as they bind to SM / Chol - rich domains . As the requirements for SM or Chol content differ among these proteins [ 37 , 38 , 40 , 46 , 50 , 78 ] , there is a choice to be made in terms of which protein to use for labeling speciﬁc cells or cell membranes . As well as binding to SM / Chol , OlyA6 and PlyA2 bind even more strongly to CPE / Chol domains . Therefore , these can be used as probes for lipid domains in invertebrates [ 63 , 64 , 81 ] . In combination with an MACPF protein , PlyB , OlyA6 , PlyA , and PlyA2 form pores in lipid membranes , and can , therefore , be used for treating some cancers [ 47 ] . Additionally , due to their SM / Chol binding properties , these proteins are promising agents for anti - viral treatments [ 40 ] , and potentially could be used also against COVID - 19 infection . They can also be used for detecting SM / Chol - related metabolic disorders [ 49 ] and as potential anti - cancer treatments through their pro - apoptotic activities , with targeting seen for colon cancer cells [ 43 ] . In addition , the use of these aegerolysins might reveal the mechanisms of regulation of lipid homeostasis [ 56 ] , which is crucial for the modulation of many cell signalling processes [ 6 , 82 ] . As the kingdom of fungi consists of more than a million different species , we also sus - pect that they contain an arsenal of diverse lipid - binding proteins that are yet to be deﬁned , among which , many might show high afﬁnity for speciﬁc membrane domains . Mushroom proteins that label SM / Chol - rich membrane domains have helped us to demonstrate that lipid rafts actually exist in living systems , and they have provided us with a useful , and indeed indispensable , toolbox for studying these domains in living vertebrate cells .
