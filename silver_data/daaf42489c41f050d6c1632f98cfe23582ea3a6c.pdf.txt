VPS27 Controls Vacuolar and Endocytic Traffic through a Prevacuolar Compartment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Robert C . Piper , Antony A . Cooper , Hong Yang , and Tom H . Stevens Institute of Molecular Biology , University of Oregon , Eugene , Oregon 97403 - 1229 Abstract . Newly synthesized vacuolar hydrolases such as carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) are sorted from the secretory pathway in the late - Golgi compartment and reach the vacuole after a distinct set of membrane - traf - ficking steps . Endocytosed proteins are also delivered to the vacuole . It has been proposed that these path - ways converge at a " prevacuolar " step before delivery to the vacuole . One group of genes has been described that appears to control both of these pathways . Cells carrying mutations in any one of the class E VPS ( vacu - olar protein sorting ) genes accumulate vacuolar , Golgi , and endocytosed proteins in a novel compartment adja - cent to the vacuole termed the " class E " compartment , which may represent an exaggerated version of the physiological prevacuolar compartment . We have char - acterized one of the class E VPS genes , VPS27 , in detail to address this question . Using a temperature - sensitive allele of VPS27 , we find that upon rapid inactivation of Vps27p function , the Golgi protein Vpsl0p ( the CPY - sorting receptor ) and endocytosed Ste3p rapidly accu - mulate in a class E compartment . Upon restoration of Vps27p function , the Vpsl0p that had accumulated in the class E compartment could return to the Golgi ap - paratus and restore correct sorting of CPY . Likewise , Ste3p that had accumulated in the class E compartment en route to the vacuole could progress to the vacuole upon restoration of Vps27p function indicating that the class E compartment can act as a functional intermedi - ate . Because both recycling Golgi proteins and endocy - tosed proteins rapidly accumulate in a class E compart - ment upon inactivation of Vps27p , we propose that Vps27p controls membrane traffic through the prevac - uolar / endosomal compartment in wild - type cells . T hE biogenesis of the lysosome has provided impor - tant insights into the mechanisms of membrane traf - fic ( Kornfeld and Mellman , 1989 ; Kornfeld , 1992 ) . Much of our knowledge stems from studying the traffick - ing of the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( M6PR ) 1 , which sorts a set of hydrolases modified by the addition of man - nose - 6 - phosphate to the lysosome . Two pathways exist by which M6PR can sort hydrolases to the lysosome ; one is the uptake of enzymes from the extracellular media via re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis and the other is the sorting of newly synthesized hydrolases from the trans - Golgi reticulum / network to the lysosome . These two pathways converge at a stage termed the prelysosomal / late endoso - mal compartment . Here the lysosomal hydrolase dissoci - ates from the receptor and is ultimately delivered to the ly - sosome while the receptor recycles to the plasma membrane Address all correspondence to Tom H .

Our understanding of this process has been greatly enhanced by the biochemical isolation and characterization of the prelysosomal compartment together with the functional identification of this compartment in cells by monitoring the traffic of newly synthesized proteins and endocytosed proteins en route to the lysosome ( Schmid et al . , 1988 , 1989 ; Slazman and Maxfield , 1989 ; Goda et al . , 1992 ) . However , little is known about the molecular machinery that controls this critical juncture in post - Golgi membrane traffic . Like the lysosome of mammalian cells , the yeast vacuole receives traffic from both the secretory pathway and the endocytic pathway , and is the major site of protein degra - dation afforded by the high concentration of active vacu - olar hydrolases ( Raymond et al . , 1992b ) . Vacuolar hydro - lases such as carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) are diverted from the secretory pathway at a step near the late - Golgi com - partment and are delivered to the vacuole ( Graham and Emr , 1991 ) . Over 50 nonessential genes required for the correct delivery of CPY from the Golgi apparatus to the vacuole have now been identified based on genetic screens that select for yeast strains that secrete CPY ( Bankaitis et al . , 1986 ; Rothman et al . , 1989 ; Klionsky et al . , 1990 ; Ray - Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 95 / 11 / 603 / 15 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , Number 3 , November 1995 603 - 617 603 mond et al . , 1992a , b ) . One of these genes , VPSIO , encodes a type I membrane protein that functions as the CPY sort - ing receptor ( Preston et al . , 1991 ; Van Dyck et al . , 1992 ; Marcusson et al . , 1994 ) . In analogy with the M6PR in mammalian cells , Vpsl0p is proposed to bind proCPY in the late - Golgi compartment and deliver this hydrolase to a prevacuolar compartment . The targeting signal on proCPY is provided in the pro region of the enzyme , which is mini - mally defined by the amino acids QRPL ( Vails et al . , 1990 ) . Delivery of proCPY to this prevacuolar compartment would allow dissociation of the receptor and ligand and re - sult in the ultimate delivery of proCPY to the vacuole where it is proteolytically cleaved to the mature form . Once CPY is delivered to a prevacuolar compartment , the CPY receptor could then return to the Golgi apparatus to sort more CPY . Although the exact identity and traffick - ing dynamics through such an intermediate prevacuolar compartment remain obscure , fractionation studies fol - lowing the trafficking of newly synthesized CPY have identified an intermediate compartment that functionally lies between the Golgi complex and the vacuole ( Vida et al . , 1993 ) . Complete isolation , characterization , and immu - nolocalization of the prevacuolar compartment has yet to be achieved . Likewise , the molecular mechanisms that control the formation of this compartment and the flux through it remain obscure , One insight into this process has been provided by a comprehensive morphological characterization of the vps mutants ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . Mutations in a subset of 13 VPS genes , categorized as class E VPS genes , cause the accumulation of both vacuolar proteins and Golgi proteins into one to two large ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 Ixm ) compartments adjacent to the vacuole ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . Because this novel compartment , hereby referred to as the " class E " compart - ment , contains high concentrations of both vacuolar pro - teins and Golgi proteins , it has been hypothesized that the class E compartment may represent an exaggerated ver - sion of the physiological prevacuolar compartment . More recently , the a - factor receptor ( Ste3p ) , a marker of the yeast endocytic system , has been found to accumulate in similar class E compartments in cells carrying mutations in another class E VPS gene , REN1 / VPS2 ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . These data suggest that the endocytic and vacuolar bio - genesis pathway s converge at a step that may be repre - sented by the class E compartment found in mutant cells . The implication from these studies is that the class E VPS genes act together at a distinct step along the vacuolar bio - genesis pathway to regulate membrane traffic through this prevacuolar compartment . It is unknown whether the class E compartment itself represents a true intermediate along the vacuolar biogene - sis pathway or merely an aberrant compartment that idio - syncratically accumulates post - Golgi / endocytic membrane traffic since previous studies used class E VPS null mu - tants . To characterize the machinery responsible for the generation of the class E compartment , we have cloned one of the class E genes , VPS27 . We have also constructed temperature - sensitive alleles of VPS27 that have allowed us to follow the CPY sorting defect and the morphological effects resulting from rapid inactivation and restoration of Vps27 protein ( Vps27p ) function . We find that inactiva - tion of Vps27p led to the accumulation of both Golgi and endocytic proteins within a class E - like compartment con - comitant with the loss of CPY sorting . Furthermore , pro - teins that had been trapped in the class E - like compart - ment could rapidly redistribute to the vacuole or recycle to the Golgi complex once Vps27p function was restored . These data demonstrate that the class E compartment rep - resents a physiological intermediate step along the biogen - esis pathway between the Golgi apparatus and the vacuole and may provide a genetic and biochemical means to ex - amine this process in detail .

All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Cloning of VPS27 VPS27 was cloned by complementation of the CPY secretion defect of the MY1885 strain carrying the vps27 - 5 ( vp123 - 5 ) allele . The MY1885 strain was transformed with a multicopy YEp24 - based genomic library ( Carlson and Botstein , 1982 ) . To select for plasmids that complemented the CPY sorting defect , Ura + transformants were grown on plates containing the negative selection compound CBZ - Phe - F3Leu ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . Large colonies were then screened for their ability to correctly sort CPY using a previously described CPY overlay blot technique ( Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . One of the complementing plasmids , pVPL23 - 1 , was further ana - lyzed by Tnl0 transposon tagging analysis according to the procedures of Huisman et al . ( 1987 ) . Briefly , pVPL23 - 1 was transformed in the Escheri - chia coli strain DB1329 that was subsequently infected with bacteriophage hLUK containing the Kan a gene . Plasmids were prepared from pooled kanamycin - resistant colonies and transformed into MY1885 cells . Plas - mids were rescued from Ura + transformants that secreted CPY and mapped to locate the minimal complementing region . The cloned insert was genetically mapped in yeast by integration of plasmid pCKR230 linearized at the NcoI site into the JHRY20 - 2C to pro - duce the Leu + HYY2 strain . The HYY2 strain was then crossed with the MY1885 ( vps27 - 5 ) strain . The resulting diploid ( HYY3 ) was sporulated and dissected . Tetrad analysis of the sporulated diploids showed that all were parental ditypes for the Leu and Vps phenotypes , confirming that the cloned DNA fragment had integrated at the VPS27 locus . Strains , Growth of Cells , and Construction of Plasmids DNA manipulations and DNA - mediated transformation of E . coli strain MC1061 were performed by routine procedures . Sequencing of both strands of the 3 , 230 - bp BamHI / EcoRI - complementing region of VPS27 ( These sequence data are available from Genbank under accession num - ber U24218 ) was completed by sequencing plasmids derived from pHY2 and pHY3 generated using the Erase - a - base kit as specified by the manu - Table II . Plasmids Used in this Study facturer ( Promega Corp . ) . PCR amplifications were performed with Vent polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . The plasmid pHY1 was generated by subcloning the complementing 3 , 230 - bp BamHI / EcoRI fragment of VPS27 into pRS316 . The plasmid pHY2 was generated by subcloning the 3 , 230 - bp BamHI / EcoRI fragment of VPS27 into pBluescriptSK + , The plasmid pKJH1 was generated by subcloning the same BamHI / EcoRI fragment into pUC19 . The plasmid pHY3 was made by subcloning the SalI / EcoRI fragment of pKJH1 into pBluescriptSK + . The integrating plasmid , pCKR230 , was made by sub - cloning the 1 . 5 - kb BamHI / XbaI fragment of pHY1 into the LEU2 - con - taining plasmid pRS305 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . The vps27 , ~ plas - mid , pKJH2 , the 1 . 2 - kb BglII / ClaI fragment of pKJH1 was replaced with the LEU2 gene derived as a 2 - kb HpaI / Hpal fragment ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . The HA epitope was inserted into VPS27 by first removing the BamHI site from pHY3 by blunt end ligation of the BamHI site , generated by cut - ting with BamHI and filling in with Klenow to yield pHY8 . A BamHI site was inserted into the 3 ' end of the VPS27 ORF just before the stop codon by in vitro mutagenesis of pHY8 using the oligonucleotide GCTAATA - GAGCTI ' GGATCCATAATATI ' GTAGC and using the bacterial strain CJ236 and the helper phage KO7 according to the method of Kunkel ( Kunkel et al . , 1987 ) . The resulting plasmid , pHY10 , was used to subclone a BglII linker ( encoding three copies of the HA epitope : YPYDVPDYA ) into the BamHI site to yield pRCP1 . The EcoRI / SalI fragment of pRCP1 was subcloned into the EcoRI / SalI sites of pRS316 to yield pRCP4 . To construct alleles of VPS27 that contained mutations at the codons predicted to coordinate the binding of zinc , pHY2 was subjected to Kunkel mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotides : Cys176 ( C1 ) GATTCT - GATGCGGCCATGATTTGCTCG ; and Cys222 ( C7 ) GCCAGTCAGAG - TGGCCGATAGCTGC . The BamHI / EcoRl of resulting plasmids pRCP25 and pRCP27 , respectively , were subcloned into pRS316 to yield pRCP28 and pRCP34 . Mutagenesis of His203 ( Hr ) and Cys179 ( C2 ) was performed by Kunkel mutagenesis with pHY1 resulting in the plasmids pRCP30 and pRCP32 respectively , using the oligonucleotides : His203 ( I - Ir ) GATI ' TCTG - CCAAGAAGCGAGTTCAAATAGTATACCC ; Cys179 ( C2 ) GATGCWT - GTATGATCGCGAGTAAAAAGTITI ' CT . The mutagenized region of all of these plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing . Expression of yeast protein fragments in bacteria was done by using pEXP1 and pEXP2 ( Roberts et al . , 1989 ) . The bacterial production of Vps27p polypeptides was done by subcloning both the 771 - bp SpeI / XbaI fragment of the VPS27 gene ( amino acids aa 16 - 273 ) into the SpeI / XbaI sites of pEXP1 produce pCKR124 and by subcloning the 939 - bp SpeI / HindllI fragment from the VPS27 gene ( aa 16 - 311 ) into the SmaI / HindIII sites of pEXP1 to produce pCKR128 . The bacterial expression plasmid for fragments of Vpsl0p ( PEP1 ; these sequence data are available from Genbank under accession number Z34098 ) were produced by subcloning the 1 . 2 - kb DraI - SpeI fragment of the VPSIO gene ( aa 306 - 696 ) into the SmaI / Xbal sites of pEXP2 - S to yield pAAC208 . A second bacterial ex - pression plasmid for Vpsl0p was made by subcloning the Dral / Spel frag - ment of VPSIO into the plasmid pMAL in frame with the maltose - binding protein ( New England Biolabs ) to produce pAAC209 .

The black ar - row depicts the VPS27 open reading frame . The SpeI / XbaI and the SpeI / HindlII fragments ( Antigen 1 and Antigen 2 , respec - tively ) were expressed in E . coli and used in the generation of af - finity - purified anti - Vps27p antisera . The HA epitope was in - serted at the 3 ' end of the open reading frame immediately before the stop codon . The vps27A : : LEU2 disruption construct is shown . ( B ) Amino acid sequence of Vps27p . The bold region designates the Zn finger region of Vps27p that is compared in C . ( C ) Sequence comparison of Vps27p with four other proteins used to overexpress Vpsl0p was made by subcloning the HpaI / Pvull frag - ment of VPSIO into the SmaI site of YEp352 ( Hill et al . , 1986 ) to produce pKE50 . Strains were constructed by standard genetic techniques and grown at 30Â°C in rich media ( 1 % yeast extract , 1 % peptone , 2 % dextrose ; YEPD ) or standard minimal medium with appropriate supplements . The HYY1 ( vps27A pep4 - 3 ) and AACY5 strain ( vps27A PEP4 ) was made by trans - forming SF383 - 9D and RPY10 , respectively , with the vps27A : : LEU2 dis - ruption cassette ( BamHI / EcoRl fragment ) from the plasmid pCKR203 and screening Leu + transformants for the secretion of CPY . Temperature - sensitive mutations in VPS27 were obtained by subject - ing pHY1 to hydroxylamine mutagenesis ( 0 . 36 M hydroxylamine for 1 h at 75Â°C ) as previously described ( Schauer et al . , 1985 ) . Hydroxylamine - treated plasmid DNA was amplified by transformation into MC1061 E . coli . The plasmid library was then transformed into the HYY1 strain ( vps27A ) . Transformants were screened for temperature - sensitive CPY secretion by performing colony blot analyses . The 23 plasmids that conferred correct sorting of CPY at 23Â°C and secretion of CPY at 37Â°C were rescued from these transformants and constitute alleles vps27 - 100 through vps27 - 123 . The insert from plasmid pRCP13 , carrying the vps27 - 123 allele , was sub - cloned into the integrating URA3 - containing vector pRS306 to yield pRCP20 , pRCP20 was linearized with BclI and transformed into SF838 - 9D . The RPY3 strain ( vps27 - ts pep4 - 3 ) carrying the stably integrated vps27 - 123 allele ( vps27 - ts ) was obtained after excision of the endogenous VPS27 gene by selection on 5 - fluoroorotic acid using the two - step gene re - placement technique ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ) . Immunoprecipitation of 35S - labeled CPY Secretion of newly synthesized CPY was quantified by immunoprecipita - tion as previously described ( Piper et al . , 1994 ) . Briefly , yeast cultures were grown overnight in selective synthetic media without methionine to OD6o ) = 1 , centrifuged , and resuspended at ODr00 = I in SD - met / 50 mM potassium phosphate , pH 5 . 7 , containing 2 mg / ml BSA . 0 . 5 ODr00 of cells were pulse labeled for 10 min with 100 I ~ Ci [ 3sS ] - Express label and chased for 40 rain upon addition of unlabeled methionine and cysteine to a final concentration of 100 ixg / ml . The chase was terminated by the addition of sodium azide to 10 mM at 0Â°C . Cells were separated from the culture me - dia by centrifugation and then spheroplasted . CPY was immunoprecipi - tated from the resulting intracellular ( spheroplasts ) and extracellular ( me - dia supernatant ) fractions and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and fluorography ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ) . Radioactivity was quantified using a radioanalytic imaging system ( AMBIS Systems , Inc . , San Diego , CA ) . To measure the onset of CPY secretion in the RPY3 strain ( vps27 - ts ) upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature , cells were grown as above at 23Â°C . Cell cul - tures were then shifted to 37Â°C for various times before the addition of la - bel . To measure the reversal of CPY secretion phenotype after return to the permissive temperature , parallel cultures of RPY3 cells ( 0 . 5 ODr00 ) were shifted to 37Â°C for 25 min and then shifted back to 22Â°C by the addi - tion of 15Â°C media ( 250 p , 1 ) and allowed to incubate for various times be - fore the initiation of pulse / chase analysis . Antibodies and Immunoblotting Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated to fragments of Vps27p that were produced by the E . coli strain MCI06I transformed with pCKR124 and purified by SDS - PAGE . The pCKR124 - derived Vps27p peptide is designated Antigen 1 ( aa 16 - 273 ) . A second Vps27 - derived peptide ( Anti - gen 2 ; aa 16 - 311 ) was produced in MC1061 cells transformed with pCKR128 and purified by SDS - PAGE as previously described ( Roberts et al . , 1989 ) . This protein was coupled to cyanogen bromide - activated sepharose that that align within the putative Zinc finger region : Pep7p / Vpsl9p / Vaclp ( these sequence data are available from Genbank under accession number M80596 ) ; HSP162 , Homo sapiens protein 162 kD ( Genbank accession number X78998 ) ; Fablp ( Genbank ac - cession number U01017 ) ; Caenorhabditis elegans ORF ( Genbank accession number U13070 ) . The Cys / His residues predicted to co - ordinate the binding of Zn are designated C1 ( Cys176 ) , C2 ( Cys179 ) , C3 ( Cy % ~ 2 ) , C4 ( Cysz95 ) , Cs ( Cys200 ) , H6 ( His203 ) , C7 ( Cys222 ) , ( ] 8 ( Cyst25 ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 606 was subsequently used to produce affinity - purified anti - Vps27p antisera as previously described ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . Antibodies to Vpsl0p / Peplp were generated against a bacterial fusion protein produced from plasmid pAAC208 . The antisera was affinity puri - fied against a maltose - binding protein fusion that was produced from plus - mid pAAC209 . Monoclonal antibodies to the c - myc epitope were purified from culture supernatants of hybridoma 9E10 obtained from the American Type Cul - ture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) . Antibodies to the 100 - kD Vo subunit of the V - ATPase ( Hill and Stevens , 1994 ) were generated as previously de - scribed . The anti - CPY mAb ( 10A5 - B5 ) and the anti - - 60 - kD snbunit of the V - ATPase ( 13Dll - B2 ) were obtained from Molecular Probes , Inc . ( Eugene , OR ) . The anti - HA mAb was purchased from BAbCO ( Rich - mond , CA ) . SDS - PAGE using 10 % polyacrylamide gels was performed under re - ducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Electroblotting was as described ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) . Immunoblotting with the anti - Vps27p antibody was done as previously described except that 1 % Tween - 20 was present during incubations ( Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ) . Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Processing Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ; Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . The anti - c - myc and the anti - HA mAbs were used at a final concentration of 10 p ~ g / ml . Cells were photographed using a fluorescent microscope ( Axioplan ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) and photographed with film ( T - MAX 400 ; East - man Kodak Co . , Rochester , NY ) . Immunofluorescence micrographs and autoradiograms were digitized with a flatbed scanner ( Reli 4816 ; Relisys , Milpitas , CA ) . Images within the same experiment were processed with Adobe Photoshop TM using identical settings and printed on a dye - sublimation printer ( Phaser 440 ; Tektronix , Beaverton , OR ) . Temperature - sensitive Experiments To assess the morphological redistribution of Vpsl0p , RPY3 cells were grown overnight in YEPD at 22Â°C after which an aliquot was fixed . The remainder of the cells were warmed to 37Â°C by the addition of prewarmed YEPD . Cells were incubated at 37Â°C and samples were removed at vari - ous times and fixed at 37Â°C . After 25 min at the nonpermissive tempera - ture , the culture was divided and cycloheximide was added to one culture to a final concentration of 100 ~ tg / ml . Both cultures were then cooled to 22Â°C by the addition of chilled YEPD and incubated at 22Â°C . Samples were removed at various times and fixed at 22Â°C ( Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . To assess the morphological redistribution of Ste3p , RPY3 cells were transformed with plasmid pSL2015 ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) carrying the galac - tose - inducible allele STE3 - c - myc . Parallel cultures were grown in syn - thetic media containing 2 % raffinose at 22Â°C overnight . Galactose was added to a final concentration of 2 % for 1 h . During this time a negligible amount of Ste3p - c - myc was produced as assessed by immunofluorescence and by immunoblot analysis . Cultures were then shifted to 37Â°C for 2 h . Cells were pelleted and one culture was resuspended in YEPD and main - tained at 37Â°C and another culture was resuspended in YEPD and main - tained at 22Â°C . Samples were removed and fixed at the respective temper - atures at 30 and 60 min after the initiation of the glucose chase . A parallel control culture was maintained at 22Â°C throughout the 3 - h galactose in - duction and the glucose chase . Results Cloning and Characterization of VPS27 The vps27 mutant was isolated by selecting for mutations in S . cerevisiae that result in the missorting and secretion of the vacuolar hydrolase CPY ( Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ; Raymond et al . , 1992b ) . To clone the VPS27 gene , the MY1885 strain bearing the vps27 - 5 allele was trans - formed with a genomic library carried in a 2Ix multicopy vector ( Carlson and Botstein , 1982 ) . Transformants were grown on plates containing CBZ - Phe - F3Leu , which inhib - Figure 2 . CPY secretion of vps27A cells . Wild - type cells ( RPY10 ; transformant 1 ) and vps27d cells ( AACY5 ; transformants 2 - 8 ) were transformed with vector alone ( pRS316 ; 1 and 2 ) ; VPS27 on a centromere - based plasmid ( pHY1 ; 3 ) ; HA epitope - tagged VPS27 on centromere - based plasmid ( pRCP4 ; 4 ) ; or mutant vps27 alleles carrying alanine substitutions at Cys176 ( CIA ; 5 ) ; Cys179 ( CzA ; 6 ) ; His203 ( H6A ; 7 ) ; Cys222 ( CTA ; 8 ) carried on the centromere - based plasmids , pRCP28 , pRCP34 , pRCP30 , and pRCP32 , respectively . ( A ) The secretion of newly synthesized CPY was measured by metabolically labeling the above transfor - mants with 35S - Express for 10 rain and chasing for 40 min at 30Â°C . CPY was immunoprecipitated from intracellular ( I ) and extracel - lular ( E ) fractions and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and fluorogra - phy . ( B ) Whole - cell extracts of the above transformants were an - alyzed by immunoblot using polyclonal antibodies specific for Vps27p , or ( C ) anti - HA antibodies . Vps27p migrated with an ap - parent molecular mass of , - ~ 89 kD . ( C ) Whole - cell extracts were also immunoblotted with anti - HA mAbs . The Vps27p - HA mi - grated with an apparent molecular mass of N89 kD . its the growth of cells that secrete CPY ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . Transformants were then screened directly for the secretion of CPY by overlay immunoblot analysis using anti - CPY polyclonal antibodies ( Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . Plasmids that conferred correct sorting of CPY were re - covered and the complementing region mapped by sub - cloning and retransformation into the vps27 strain ( MY - 1885 ) . The minimal complementing region was encompassed by a 3 , 230 - bp BamHI / EcoRI fragment ( Fig . 1 ) . To confirm that the genomic DNA cloned was VPS27 , a 1 . 5 - kb BamHI / XbaI fragment was subcloned into an integrating vector containing the LEU2 gene and transformed into the JHRY20 - 2C strain after linearizing the plasmid by restric - tion enzyme digestion within the VPS27 fragment . A Leu + transformant ( HYY2 ) was then crossed to the MY1885 strain ( vps27 - 5 ) . Tetrad analysis of the resulting diploid ( HYY3 ) showed that all spores from 20 tetrads were pa - rental ditypes ( Leu + Vps + and Leu - Vps - ) indicating tight linkage between VPS27 . ' : LEU2 and the vps27 - 5 allele . Both strands of the minimal complementing BamHI / EcoRI fragment encompassing the VPS27 gene were se - quenced . This region was also recently identified by the yeast genome project and is reported as ORF N2038 lo - cated on the right arm of chromosome XIV ( Verhasselt et al . , 1994 ) . Analysis of the predicted primary amino acid se - Piper et al . Vps27p Controls Prevacuolar Membrane Traffic 607 quence showed that Vps27p is a hydrophilic protein of 621 amino acids ( molecular mass 70 . 9 kD ) that contains two putative Zinc finger domains defined by CX2C - X12 - CX2C X4 CXaH - X18 - CX2C . A BLAST search with the VPS27 open reading frame revealed that Vps27p has limited ho - mology with other proteins implicated in the control of trans - Golgi / endocytic traffic . These include Fablp , a PI ( 4 ) P ki - nase homologue essential for vacuole morphology in S . cerevisiae ( Yamamoto et al . , 1995 ) ; Pep7p / Vpsl9p , a pro - tein required for vacuolar protein sorting and vacuolar in - heritance also in S . cerevisiae ( Weisman and Wickner , 1992 ; Zhang et al . , 1994 ) , and Homo sapiens protein 170 , a 170 - kD protein localized to endosomes of HeLa cells ( Fig . 1 B ) . Curiously , the similarity among these proteins is re - stricted to the putative Zinc finger region . The composi - tion of this type of Zinc finger region is similar to the class of Zinc finger structures that specify protein / protein inter - actions rather than DNA binding ( Berg , 1990 ; Coleman , 1992 ) . The homology within this region with other pro - teins involved in post - Golgi membrane traffic implies that this region may represent a discrete functional domain . The requirement of Vps27p function for CPY sorting was investigated by constructing haploid strains that were disrupted for VPS27 ( vps27A ) . This was accomplished by using a plasmid ( pKJH2 ) in which the BgllI / ClaI fragment ( encompassing amino acids 38 - 506 ) of the VPS27 gene was replaced with the LEU2 gene ( Fig . 1 C ) ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . Disruption of the VPS27 locus was confirmed by both immunoblot analysis with antisera raised against the Vps27 protein and by PCR amplification of genomic DNA . We then measured the secretion of newly synthe - sized CPY by immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 2 A ) . Cells were labeled with [ 35S ] - methionine for 7 min and chased with an excess of cold methionine and cysteine for 40 min at 30Â°C . Labeled CPY was then immunoprecipitated from the in - tracellular and extracellular fractions and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Wild - type cells ( RPY10 ) were able to cor - rectly sort CPY to the vacuole and proteolytically process CPY to the mature form . However , cells carrying the vps27A allele ( AACY5 ) secreted ~ 50 % of newly synthesized CPY in the unprocessed pro form ( p2CPY ) , while the remain - ing intracellular portion of CPY was fully processed to the mature form indicating that the intracellular CPY had been delivered to a compartment containing active vacuolar hy - drolases . There was no secretion defect in AACY5 cells ( vps27za ) that had been transformed with the VPS27 gene carried on a centromere - based plasmid ( plasmid pHY1 ) . Protein extracts from wild - type yeast were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblot procedures using polyclonal antisera raised against Vps27p . These antibodies specifi - cally recognized a ~ 85 - kD band corresponding to the VPS27 gene product in both wild - type cells ( RPY10 ) and Figure 3 . Localization of Vps27p in wild - type and Class E vps mu - tant cells . A centro ' mere - based plasmid carrying an HA - tagged VPS27 gene ( pRCP4 ) was trans - formed into wild - type cells ( SF838 - 9D ) ( A ) and vps23 cells ( MYll50 ) ( B ) carrying a muta - tion in a class E VPS gene . Cells were labeled with anti - HA mono - clonal antibodies in combination with biotin - linked secondary and streptavidin FITC and also la - beled with antibodies to the 100 - kD subunit of the V - ATPase in combination with Texas red - con - jugated secondary antibodies . The Nomarski image is also shown . As a control for labeling with the anti - HA monoclonal an - tibodies , wild - type ( SF838 - 9D ) cells were transformed with vec - tor alone ( pRS316 ) and labeled as above ( C ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 608 Figure 4 . vps27A cells accumulate Golgi , vacuolar , and endocytosed proteins in the same distinct perivacuolar compartments . Wild - type cells ( SF838 - 9D ; left panels A and C ) and vps27A cells ( HYY1 ; right panels B and D ) were grown overnight in YEPD at 30Â°C , fixed and spheroplasted , and double labeled with the indicated antibodies . Vpsl0p was labeled with affinity - purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies in combination with biotin - linked secondary antibody and streptavidin FITC ( A and B ) . For the localization of Ste3p , wild - type cells ( C ) and vps27A cells ( D ) were transformed with pSL2015 ( GAL1 - STE3 - c - myc ) to express c - myc epitope - tagged Ste3p . Transformants were grown in galactose for 4 h at 30Â°C and shifted to glucose - containing media for 30 min before fixation and labeling with anti - - c - myc mono - clonal antibodies . The anti c - myc monoclonal antibodies were used to visualize the Ste3p - c - myc in combination with biotin - conjugated secondary antibody and streptavidin FITC . The monoclonal antibodies to the 60 - kD V - ATPase subunit ( C and D ) and polyclonal anti - bodies to the 100 - kD V - ATPase subunit ( A and B ) were visualized by secondary antibody conjugated to Texas red . Labeling of vpslOA cells ( RPY32 ) lacking Vpsl0p with the Vpsl0p antibodies ( E ) and labeling of wild - type cells transformed with pRS316 with anti - c - myc monoclonal antibodies ( F ) are shown to demonstrate the specificity of immunolabeling . vps27A cells ( AACY5 ) transformed with the VPS27 plas - mid ( pHY1 ) , but was absent in vps27A cells ( AACY5 ) trans - formed with vector alone ( Fig . 2 B ) . No other bands were observed with the anti - Vps27p antisera . To test whether the putative zinc finger region of Vps27p was required for function , we constructed alleles of VPS27 with alterations in the residues predicted to coordinate the binding of Zinc . Replacement of either Cys176 ( C1 ) , Cys179 ( C2 ) , His203 ( H6 ) or Cys222 ( C8 ) of Vps27p with ala - nine resulted in loss of Vps27p function as shown by a loss in CPY sorting ability ( Fig . 2 A ) . The CPY sorting defect of cells carrying the His203 ( H6 ) to Ala allele was greatly exacerbated when cells were grown at 37Â°C ( data not shown ) . Immunoblot analysis of the cells carrying the mu - tated Zinc finger residue mutations showed that the Vps27 proteins were stable and produced to similar levels ( Fig . 2B ) . Fractionation studies were performed to further bio - chemically characterize Vps27p . We found that ~ 60 % of the Vps27p in whole - cell lysates sedimented with the Piper et al . Vps27p Controls Prevacuolar Membrane Traffic 609 membrane fraction , however , this membrane association was only found in the presence of divalent cations . In the presence of EDTA , Vps27p was quantitatively recovered in the cytosolic fractions . Upon further experimentation , we found that the divalent cation - dependent membrane association of Vps27p was independent of mutations in the Zinc finger domain ( data not shown ) . Vps27p Localizes to the Class E Compartment We immunolocalized Vps27p to address where Vps27p functions in the vacuolar biogenesis pathway ( Fig . 3 ) . To facilitate the localization of Vps27p , we constructed an epitope - tagged allele of VPS27 by inserting an epitope from the hemagglutinin envelope glycoprotein into the 3 ' end of the coding region . The VPS27 - HA allele was able to fully complement the CPY - secretion defect when intro - duced into vps27A cells ( AACY5 ) ( Fig . 2 A ) . Immunoblot analysis showed that the epitope - tagged Vps27p ( Vps27p - HA ) was produced to similar levels as endogenous Vps27p and as expected had an apparent molecular mass of ~ 4 kD larger than the wild - type Vps27p ( Fig . 2 B ) . Vps27p - HA was recognized as a single band by anti - HA monoclonal antibodies ( Fig . 2 C ) . In wild - type cells ( SF838 - 9D ) , Vps27p - HA was localized to small punctate structures often near the vacuole as well as dispersed throughout the cytoplasm . These structures were distinct from the vacuole as demonstrated by double - label immunofluorescence with antibodies to the 100 - kD V - ATPase subunit ( Fig . 3 A ) . We next localized Vps27p in cells carrying a mutation in the another class E VPS gene , VPS23 , to determine if the class E compartment itself was the site of Vps27p function . As previously reported for vps27 and vps23 mutants , the 100 - kD subunit of the V - ATPase accumulates in the class E compartment characterized as 1 - 3 perivacuolar compartments per cell and thus serves as a good marker for this structure ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . In vps23 cells ( MYll50 ) , Vps27p - HA was localized to 1 - 3 perivacuolar class E structures ( Fig . 3 B ) . These same class E structures also contained the majority of the 100 - kD V - ATPase subunit . Wild - type cells not expressing the HA epitope - tagged Vps27p are shown in Fig . 3 C as a control for nonspecific labeling . These data imply that Vps27p as - sociates with membranes and that the class E compartment , or physiological counterpart thereof , may be the site of ac - tion of Vps27p . VpslOp and Ste3p Accumulate in the Class E Compartment A series of indirect double immunofluorescence labeling experiments were performed to localize markers of the vacuole ( V - ATPase ) , the endocytic system ( Ste3p ) , and the late - Golgi compartment ( VpslOp ) in both wild - type cells ( SF838 - 9D ) and cells disrupted for vps27A ( HYY1 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Both strains were deficient in vacuolar hydrolases ( pep4 - 3 ) to facilitate the localization of these proteins . The Vpsl0p membrane protein , a type I membrane protein that functions as the CPY sorting receptor ( Marcusson et al . , 1994 ) , was immunolocalized using antibodies gener - ated against the large NH2 - terminal luminal domain . In wild - type cells , anti - Vpsl0p antisera produced a specific Golgi - like labeling pattern composed of 7 - 12 punctate structures per cell ( Fig . 4 A ) . However , in vps27A cells ( HYY1 ) Vpsl0p and the V - ATPase were localized to the A 4 ~ sJ > . Â¢1 . cj 4O 30 to 370C 11 ) 0 0 20 40 60 80 TIME ( min ) Figure 5 . Mislocalization of Vpsl0p results in its rapid PEP4 - dependent proteolysis . Vpsl0p is cleaved in a PEP4 - dependent manner in vps27A cells . Wild - type cells ( RPY10 ) , vps27A PEP4 cells ( AACY5 ) and vps27A pep4 - 3 cells ( HYY1 ) were labeled with 35S - Express for 10 rain and chased for the times indicated . Labeled Vpsl0p was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and fluorography . Figure 6 . Kinetics of onset and reversal of CPY secretion pheno - type in vps27 - ts cells . The time course of secretion of newly syn - thesized CPY was measured in vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) ( open cir - cles ) ( A ) . Cells were grown at 23Â°C and incubated at 37Â°C for the times indicated before initiation of a 7 - min pulse with 35S - Express label and a 35 - min chase . CPY was immunoprecipitated from both intracellular and extracellular fractions and the percent of secre - tion was quantified and plotted as a function of time . The reversal of the CPY - secretion phenotype was measured in RPY3 cells that were shifted to 37Â°C for 25 min before return to 22Â°C for the times indicated ( closed squares ) . ( B ) Newly synthesized CPY was labeled and immunoprecipitated as above . Immunoprecipitation of CPY from intracellular and extracellular fractions is shown for vps27 - ts cells ( RPY2 ) preincubated for the indicated times at 37Â°C before the initiation of a 7 - min pulse and 35 - min chase . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 610 Figure 7 . Redistribution of Vpsl0p in vps27 - ts cells , vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) were grown in YEPD at 22Â°C and shifted to 37Â°C . Aliquots were removed and fixed at the times indicated ( A - F ) . After 25 min at 37Â°C , cells were shifted back to 22Â°C and aliquots were removed and fixed at the times indicated ( G - L ) . Fixed cells were sphero - plasted and labeled with anti - Vpsl0p antibodies in combination with biotin - linked secondary an - tibody and streptavidin - conju - gated FITC . same class E structure ( Fig . 4 A ) . Morphometric analysis showed that of the cells labeled for both antigens , > 95 % exhibited colocalization of these antigens . Analysis of the intracellular distribution of these cells showed that al - though the relative intensities of the staining pattern dif - fered , most of the structures labeled with anti - V - ATPase antibodies were also labeled with anti - Vpsl0p . To localize Ste3p we used a c - myc epitope - tagged allele of STE3 under the inducible control of the GALl pro - moter in both wild - type cells ( SF838 - 9D ) and vps27A cells ( HYY1 ) ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . In wild - type cells , Ste3p is rap - idly delivered to the vacuole via endocytosis after reaching the plasma membrane ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . Cells were grown in galactose for 4 h and then transferred to glucose - containing media before fixation and immunolabeling with anti - c - myc monoclonal antibodies . Ste3p was found exclusively in the vacuole of wild - type cells ( Fig . 4 B ) ; how - ever , in HYY1 cells ( vps27A ) , Ste3p was localized to the same class E compartments that contained the V - ATPase ( Fig . 4 B ) . Thus , the class E compartment present in cells containing the vps27za allele accumulates traffic from both the vacuolar biogenesis and the endocytic routes . To examine further the trafficking of Vpsl0p , we ex - ploited the observation that the class E compartment con - tains active vacuolar proteases ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . Delivery of Vpsl0p to a compartment containing vacuolar Piper et al . Vps27p Controls Prevacuolar Membrane Traffic 611 hydrolases can be monitored by a PEP4 - dependent cleav - age of the Vpsl0p luminal domain . This cleavage is ob - served in cells expressing Vpsl0p lacking its cytoplasmic Golgi - retention signal or in vpslA cells expressing wild - type Vpsl0p ( Cooper , A . A . , and T . H . Stevens , unpub - lished observations ) since vpslA cells are defective in Golgi retention and mislocalize Golgi proteins to the vacu - ole ( Wilsbach and Payne , 1993 ; Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ) . We followed the PEP4 - dependent cleavage of newly synthe - sized Vpsl0p in cells lacking Vps27p function . Wild - type cells ( RPY10 ) and vps27A cells ( AACY5 ) were biosytheti - cally labeled with [ 35S ] methionine for 10 min and then chased in the presence of unlabeled methionine for 15 , 30 , or 60 rain before immunoprecipitation of Vpsl0p . Fig . 5 shows that in wild - type cells , Vpsl0p is a very stable pro - tein . However , in vps27A cells , newly synthesized Vpsl0p is rapidly cleaved in a PEP4 - dependent manner indicating delivery to the proteolytically active class E compartment . The half time of proteolytic processing of newly synthe - sized Vpsl0p was ~ 40 - 50 min . Rapid Inactivation of Vps27p Leads to Redistribution of the CPY Receptor into the Class E Compartment As shown in Fig . 4 , vps27A cells accumulate both Vpsl0p and Ste3p in aberrant class E compartments characteristi - cally close to the vacuole . To address whether the class E compartment observed in cells disrupted for VPS27 repre - sents a physiological intermediate along the vacuolar bio - genesis pathway , we isolated alleles of VPS27 that were temperature sensitive for function . A library of hydroxyl - amine - mutagenized centromere - based plasmids contain - ing VPS27 ( plasmid pHY1 ) was transformed into vps27A cells ( HYY1 ) . Plasmids were rescued from transformants that secreted CPY when grown at 37Â°C but not at 22Â°C . Several temperature - sensitive vps27 alleles were found and one , vps27 - 123 , was found to exhibit ~ 50 % CPY se - cretion at 37Â°C and little secretion ( ~ 5 % ) at 22Â°C . This level of CPY secretion was the same as found in vps27A cells . The vps27 - 123 ( vps27 - ts ) allele was integrated at the VPS27 locus of SF838 - 9D cells to produce the RPY3 strain ( vps27 - ts ) . The onset of the CPY secretion phenotype of vps27 - ts cells was measured by shifting cells from 22Â°C to the nonper - missive temperature ( 37Â°C ) for various times and immu - noprecipitating newly synthesized CPY from intracellular and extracellular fractions prepared from [ 35S ] methionine - labeled cells . Half - maximal CPY secretion was observed af - ter 10 min at 37Â°C demonstrating that there is a rapid loss of Vps27p function upon shift to the nonpermissive tem - perature ( Fig . 6 A ) . Because the onset of CPY secretion was rapid , these data imply that Vps27p plays a direct role in the sorting of CPY . The fate of the remaining intracellu - lar CPY was also monitored at various times after shift to the nonpermissive temperature in vps27 - ts cells ( Fig . 6 B ) . Soon after shift to the nonpermissive temperature a por - tion of the intracellular CPY is found in the Golgi - modified precursor form ( p2 CPY ) . When cells were maintained for longer times at the nonpermissive temperature before la - beling , most of the intracellular CPY was matured , similar to what was observed for vps27A cells . The most likely ex - Figure 8 . Redistribution of Vpsl0p in vps27 - ts cells does not re - quire new protein synthesis . Cells were shifted to 37Â°C for 25 min as in Fig . 7 except that cells were returned to 22Â°C in the presence of 100 izg / ml cycloheximide to prevent synthesis of new Vpsl0p . Aliquots were removed at the times indicated and fixed , sphero - plasted , and immunolabeled for Vpsl0p . planation is that CPY is delivered to the newly accumu - lated prevacuole compartment that rapidly becomes pro - teolytically charged . As the time at the nonpermissive temperature continues , more of the intracellular CPY is processed to the mature form . We then investigated the morphological effects of rapid inactivation of Vps27p function . For this analysis we fol - lowed the trafficking of the CPY receptor , Vpsl0p , in cells carrying the vps27 - ts allele ( RPY3 ) . vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) were grown at 22Â°C and shifted to 37Â°C for various times before fixation and immunolabeling with anti - Vpsl0p an - tibodies ( Fig . 7 ) . In vps27 - ts cells grown at 22Â°C , Vpsl0p The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 612 was distributed in 7 - 12 punctate structures and was indis - tinguishable from the labeling pattern observed in wild - type cells grown either at 30 ( Fig . 3 ) , 22 , or 37Â°C ( data not shown ) . Upon shift to 37Â°C , Vpsl0p rapidly redistributed from a punctate pattern to one to three perivacuolar struc - tures very similar to the class E compartments observed in vps27A cells ( HYY1 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Partial redistribution of Vpsl0p was observed as early as 5 min at the nonpermis - sive temperature . Redistribution of Vpsl0p to class E structures was maximal by 25 min at 37Â°C and no further ef - fects on Vpsl0p distribution were observed in cells main - tained at 37Â°C for 2 h ( data not shown ) . Morphometic analysis of immunofluorescence images revealed that by 20 min 91 % of the vps27 - ts cells showed a class E - like phenotype , with most of the Vpsl0p localized in one to two perivacuolar compartments . In contrast , only 3 % of vps27 - ts cells maintained at 22Â°C displayed a class E - like morphology . The kinetics of the morphological redistribu - tion of Vpsl0p to class E - like structures ( Fig . 7 ) closely followed the onset of the CPY secretion phenotype ( Fig . 6 ) . The rapid accumulation of Vpsl0p into class E struc - tures coupled with the simultaneous loss of CPY sorting is consistent with the model that Vps27p controls the flux through a compartment through which Vpsl0p normally passes . To test further whether the class E compartment that accumulates after loss of Vps27p function represents a physiologically relevant prevacuolar compartment , we de - termined whether Vpsl0p could redistribute from the class E compartment back to its wild - type punctate distribution once Vps27p function was restored , vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) were grown at 22Â°C and shifted to 37Â°C for 25 min to accu - mulate Vpsl0p into class E structures , and then shifted back to 22Â°C for various times before fixation and immuno - labeling with anti - Vpsl0p antibodies ( Fig . 7 ) . Redistribu - tion of Vpsl0p from the class E structures to a wild - type punctate distribution was evident by 30 min at 22Â°C and complete by 40 min . At intermediate times , Vpsl0p was often observed in small tubulelike processes emanating from the class E compartment . The redistribution kinetics of Vpsl0p back to its wild - type pattern closely paralleled the return of CPY sorting function ( Fig . 6 ) . Correct sorting of CPY in vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) was restored by 35 min af - Figure 9 . Ste3p is reversibly trapped in the class E compart - ment in vps27 - ts cells , vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) were transformed with the centromere - based plas - mid pSL2015 ( GAL1 - STE3 - c - myc ) . Transformants were grown in galactose at either 22Â°C ( A and B ) or 37Â°C ( C - F ) . Cells were then resuspended in glu - cose - containing media at 22Â°C ( A and B and E and F ) or 37Â°C ( C and D ) . Aliquots were re - moved and fixed at 30 and 60 min after the addition of glucose and immunolabeled with anti - c - myc monoclonal antibodies in combination with biotin - linked secondary antibodies and streptavidin FITC . In E and F , vacuolar labeling and labeling of the class E compartment are in - dicated by arrowhead ( ~ ) and arrow ( ~ - - ) respectively . Piper et al . Vps27p Controls Prevacuolar Membrane Traffic 613 Figure 10 . Overexpression of Vpsl0p can suppress the CPY secretion phenotype of vps27A cells , vps27A cells ( AACY5 ) were transformed with a multicopy plasmid car - rying VPSIO ( + ; pKEY50 ) or vector alone ( - ; YEp352 ) . Newly synthesized CPY was immunoprecipitated from in - tracellular ( / ) and extracellu - lar ( E ) fractions prepared from transformants labeled with 35S - Express for 10 min and chased for 35 min . ter return to the permissive temperature indicating that Vpsl0p had functionally redistributed to the Golgi complex where it could bind ligand . To exclude the possibility that the apparent redistribution of Vpsl0p upon reversal of the temperature - sensitive block was entirely due to new synthesis of Vpsl0p , we followed the fate of Vpsl0p during morphological reversal in the presence of cycloheximide , vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) were grown at 22Â°C and shifted to 37Â°C for 25 min . Cyclohexi - mide was added ( 100 txg / ml ) immediately before shifting cells back to 22Â°C for various times before fixation and im - munolabeling with anti - Vpsl0p antibodies . Fig . 8 shows that the kinetics of Vpsl0p redistribution from class E compartment to a punctate wild - type distribution was un - affected by cycloheximide . Cycloheximide had no effect on cells maintained at 22Â°C ( Fig . 8 D ) and had no effect on the kinetics of Vpsl0p redistribution to the class E com - partment upon shift from 22Â°C to the nonpermissive 37Â°C ( data not shown ) . These data indicate that once Vpsl0p accumulates in the class E compartment it redistributes to the Golgi apparatus in a functional manner and is not de - livered to the vacuole for degradation once Vps27p func - tion is restored . Ste3p Is Transported from the Class E Compartment to the Vacuole Once Vps27p Function Is Restored Both vacuolar and endocytic traffic accumulates in the class E compartment implying that this compartment may represent an exaggerated version of where both pathways intersect . To test further whether the class E compartment represents an intermediate compartment encountered en route to the vacuole , we determined whether an endocy - tosed protein ( Ste3p ) trapped in the class E compartment could progress to the vacuole upon restoration of Vps27p function . We followed the distribution of the a - factor re - ceptor ( Ste3p ) in vps27 - ts cells ( RPY3 ) carrying a cen - tromere - based plasmid containing a c - myc epitope - tagged allele of STE3 under the inducible control of the GALl promoter . Thus , Ste3p - c - myc could be induced by the ad - dition of galactose at the nonpermissive temperature ( 37Â°C ) and its distribution followed after return to the permissive temperature ( 22Â°C ) in the absence of new synthesis of Ste3p - c - myc afforded by glucose repression . Cells were grown to mid - log phase at 22Â°C in media containing raffi - nose ; production of the Ste3p was induced by the addition of galactose to ceils maintained at 22Â°C or shifted to 37Â°C . After the induction of Ste3p - e - mye at 37Â°C , cells were washed and resuspended in media containing 2 % glucose and maintained at either 37Â°C or shifted to 22Â°C for both 30 min and 60 min before fixation and immunolabeling with anti - c - myc mAbs . New synthesis of Ste3p - c - myc was inhibited by glucose repression of the GALl promoter during the 30 - and 60 - min chase periods . Fig . 9 ( A and B ) shows that the Ste3p - c - myc protein in - duced at 22Â°C was correctly localized to the vacuole in a very similar distribution as reported by Davis et al . ( 1993 ) . When Ste3p - c - myc synthesis was induced at 37Â°C and maintained at 37Â°C in glucose for either 30 or 60 min , Ste3p - c - myc was localized to 1 - 2 perivacuolar compart - ments characteristic of class E structures ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . However , when Ste3p - c - myc was induced at 37Â°C but fol - lowed by a glucose chase at 22Â°C we found that Ste3p was localized to the vacuole . After 30 min at 22Â°C , both class E - like structures as well as vacuoles were labeled for Ste3p - c - myc indicating that there was partial delivery of Ste3p - c - myc to the vacuole . The delivery of Ste3p to the vacuole was complete by 60 min after return to the permis - sive temperature ( Fig . 9 F ) . These data show that the en - docytosed Ste3p accumulates in the class E compartment in the absence of Vps27p function and can proceed from there to the vacuole once Vps27p function is restored . These data imply that the class E compartment that accu - mulates in the absence of Vps27p represents a functional intermediate in the endocytic pathway to the vacuole . Overexpression of VpslOp Suppresses the vps27A CPY Sorting Defect The data presented above indicate that the loss of Vps27p function results in the accumulation of a post - Golgi / pre - vacuolar compartment that traps membrane traffic along both the endocytic and the vacuolar biogenesis pathways . The concomitant redistribution of the CPY receptor , Vpsl0p , with the loss of CPY sorting indicates that CPY secretion is caused by depleting the late - Golgi compart - ment of functional Vpsl0p . One possible explanation is that the recycling of Vpsl0p from the class E compartment back to the Golgi apparatus is inhibited . To test this we de - termined whether overexpression of Vpsl0p could sup - press the CPY sorting defect in vps27A cells . Overproduc - tion of Vpsl0p would increase the level of Vpsl0p in the late - Golgi sorting compartment independent of receptor recycling . Newly synthesized CPY was immunoprecipi - tated from intracellular and extracellular fractions from vps27A cells ( AACY5 ) transformed with either a multi - copy vector carrying VPSIO or vector alone , vps27A cells carrying vector alone secreted ~ 45 % of newly synthesized CPY , whereas vps27A cells overexpressing Vpsl0p se - creted only ~ 10 % ( Fig . 10 ) . Immunoblot analysis of whole - cell extracts of the corresponding cells showed that Vpsl0p was overproduced by the multicopy plasmid by > 10 - fold ( data not shown ) . All of the intracellular CPY was pro - cessed to the mature form indicative of its delivery to a proteolytieally charged class E compartment . These data imply that the binding and sorting of CPY by Vpsl0p as well as trafficking of Vpsl0p from the Golgi apparatus to the class E compartment is normal , but that Vpsl0p fails to recycle to the Golgi complex in the absence of Vps27p function . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 131 , 1995 614 Figure I1 . Model of Vps27p function . Delivery of CPY from the late - Golgi sorting compartment to the vacuole is thought to in - volve a transport intermediate shown as a prevacuolar compart - ment . This prevacuolar compartment lies within the intersection of the endocytic and vacuolar biogenesis pathways and is presum - ably the site where p2CPY is uncoupled from the CPY - sorting re - ceptor , Vpsl0p . Loss of Vps27p may block the return of Golgi proteins from this compartment as well as vacuolar and endocy - tosed proteins to the vacuole . This block would result in the accu - mulation of these proteins in an exaggerated compartment that resembles the physiological prevacuolar compartment . We also surveyed the CPY secretion phenotype in vari - ous other vps mutants for their ability to be suppressed by overexpression of Vpsl0p . We observed marked suppres - sion in other class E vps mutants ( vps23 and vps28 ) while no suppression was observed in vps8 ( class A ) vps34 ( class D ) , vps45 ( class D ) vpsl ( class F ) , or vps26 ( class F ) mu - tant strains ( data not shown ) . Thus , the ability of CPY se - cretion to be suppressed by overexpression of Vpsl0p ap - pears to be a general feature of class E vps mutants and not other classes of vps mutants . Discussion Our initial molecular characterization of VPS27 was moti - vated by the observation that mutations in VPS27 caused the accumulation of both Golgi proteins and vacuolar pro - teins in a novel compartment adjacent to the vacuole . Mu - tations in 12 other VPS genes result in a very similar phe - notype to vps27A and have been collectively referred to as class E VPS genes ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) because of the accumulation of these distinctive class E compartments . One of the class E vps mutants , vps2 / renI , has also been shown to accumulate the a - factor receptor Ste3p in similar class E compartments ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . More recently , the lipid - soluble styryl dye FM - 464 , which serves as an en - docytic tracer , has also been shown to accumulate in class E - like structures ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . Our analysis of vps27zl cells confirms these earlier findings as we show that endocytosed Ste3p , and the CPY sorting receptor , Vpsl0p , which functions in the late - Golgi compartment , are colocalized within the same distinct class E compart - ments as the V - ATPase . Other proteins such as the ER membrane protein Dpmlp , and the plasma membrane protein Pmalp , maintain their normal localization in cells carrying the vps27A allele ( data not shown ) . More impor - tantly , the remainder of the secretory pathway is function - ally intact in class E vps mutants , since CPY as well as other secretory proteins are secreted as fully Golgi - modi - fled glycoproteins . Thus , the accumulation of membrane traffic in the class E compartment appears to be specific for proteins that move through post - Golgi / endocytic com - partments . The convergence of both the endocytic pathway and the vacuolar pathway within the class E compartment has led to the idea that the class E compartment may represent an exaggerated version of a physiological prevacuolar com - partment through which endocytic and Golgi proteins nor - mally pass . Such an exaggerated compartment would re - sult if membrane traffic out of this compartment were inhibited . Alternatively , loss of Vps27p function may indi - rectly lead to the sequestration of membrane traffic in an entirely aberrant compartment that does not reflect a physiological process . To distinguish between these possi - bilities , we have constructed temperature - sensitive alleles of VPS27 and followed the morphological changes upon rapid inactivation of Vps27p function . Our premise was that if the class E compartment results from a block in traffic at a prevacuolar intermediate step through which membrane traffic normally travels , then both Golgi pro - teins and endocytosed proteins should reversibly accumu - late at this step upon inactivation of Vps27p function . In vps27 - ts cells we found that the CPY receptor , Vpsl0p , rapidly accumulated in class E structures upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature . This redistribution of Vpsl0p was concomitant with the onset of CPY secre - tion . The CPY secretion defect is most likely due to the depletion of Vpsl0p from the late - Golgi sorting compart - ment and its accumulation in a post - Golgi compartment , since overexpression of Vpsl0p suppressed the CPY se - cretion defect in cells lacking Vps27p function . Once Vps27p function was restored by returning vps27 - ts cells to 22Â°C , we found that Vpsl0p redistributed from class E compartments back to a dispersed punctate distribution indistinguishable from that observed in wild - type cells . CPY sorting was also restored in concert with the redistri - bution of Vpsl0p , indicating that functional Vpsl0p had reached the Golgi complex . The thermo - reversibility of the class E compartment was also observed for the en - docytic marker , Ste3p . Once Ste3p had been trapped in the class E compartment in vps27 - ts cells at the nonper - missive temperature , Ste3p could progress to the vacuole once Vps27p function was restored . Thus , in both onset and reversal experiments , the class E compartment itself can define an intermediate step between the plasma mem - brane and the vacuole as well as serve as a site for the re - cycling of Vpsl0p back to the Golgi complex . Our general model for Vps27p function is shown in Fig . 11 and predicts that Vps27p acts at the level of a prevacu - olar compartment that serves as a transport intermediate along the vacuolar biogenesis pathway . Such a prevacuolar compartment is analogous to the prelysosomal compart - ment in mammalian cells that receives lysosomal hydrolases from clathrin - coated vesicles derived from both the plasma membrane and the trans - Golgi reticulum ( Marquardt et al . , 1987 ; Griffiths et al . , 1988 ) . In the delivery of CPY to the vacuole , this prevacuolar compartment would not only serve as the site where the CPY receptor , Vpsl0p , would dissociate from proCPY and recycle to the Golgi complex , but also where endocytic traffic would travel en route to the vacuole . It is likely that the physiological counterpart Piper et al . Vps27p Controls Prevacuolar Membrane Traffic 615 of the class E compartment may itself be the site of inter - section between these two pathways . The existence of a prevacuolar compartment is supported by fractionation studies that have kinetically identified a prevacuolar inter - mediate that contains newly synthesized proCPY and is distinct from the late - Golgi compartment ( Vida et al . , 1993 ) . Similarly , studies by Singer - Krtiger and co - workers have identified distinct endocytic intermediates en route to the vacuole ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ; Singer - Krtiger et al . , 1993 ) . The existence of such a prevacuolar compartment along the vacuolar biogenesis pathway would also predict that at least two distinct vesicle budding / fusion steps may be re - quired for traffic from the Golgi complex to the vacuole . Supporting this prediction is the finding that there are two distinct Rab proteins ( Vps21p / Ypt51p and Ypt7p ) and Seclp - like proteins ( Vps45p and Vps33p ) that have been shown to control vacuolar protein sorting ( Banta et al . , 1990 ; Wichmann et al . , 1992 ; Schimmoller and Riezman , 1993 ; Cowles et al . , 1994 ; Horazdovsky et al . , 1994 ; Piper et al . , 1994 ; Singer - Krtiger et al . , 1994 ) . Vps27p , and the other class E Vps proteins , appear to control the flux of protein traffic out of the prevacuolar compartment . Loss of Vps27p function would lead to an accumulation of membrane traffic at this step and lead to the exaggeration of this compartment . This is supported by ultrastructural examination of vps27 - ts ceils after shift to the nonpermissive temperature that shows an aggrega - tion of tubular elements into a distinctive fenestrated struc - ture that is also observed in vps27A cells ( Whitters , E . A . , and T . H . Stevens , unpublished observations ) . Exactly how the loss of Vps27p inhibits the movement of proteins out of the prevacuolar compartment remains to be determined . Vps27p may function in a general way to effect the tubu - larization or vesiculation of prevacuolar membranes . Al - ternatively , Vps27p may be required for sorting and segre - gation of proteins returning to the Golgi complex from those destined for the vacuole within the prevacuolar compart - ment . Thus , perhaps in the absence of such a sorting step , the prevacuolar compartment may not be able to vesiculate . Further insights into how the class E Vps proteins func - tion on the molecular level may be provided by the cloning and sequencing of this class of VPS genes . One clue as to the mechanism of Vps27p function is provided by the ob - servation that Vps27p itself associates with the class E compartment when localized in cells carrying a mutation in another class E VPS gene ( Fig . 4 ) . These data imply that Vps27p may act on the prevacuolar compartment itself presumably in concert with a host of other proteins re - sponsible for its membrane association . Given the similari - ties among their mutant phenotypes , the likely candidates for such interaction are the other class E Vps proteins themselves ( Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . This will motivate the exploration of biochemical and genetic interactions among the class E VPS genes . Furthermore , the ability to rapidly accumulate the class E compartment will also enable bio - chemical analysis of this elusive compartment and help differentiate distinct transport steps along the vacuolar biogenesis pathway .
