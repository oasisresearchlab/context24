Summary 1 The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic disrupted daily life and changes 2 to routines were made in accordance with public health regulations . In 2020 , non - 3 pharmaceutical interventions were put in place to reduce exposure to and spread of 4 the disease . The goal of this work was to quantify the effect of school closure dur - 5 ing the first year of COVID - 19 pandemic in Switzerland . This allowed us to deter - 6 mine the usefulness of school closures as a pandemic countermeasure for emerging 7 coronaviruses in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions . The use of multivariate 8 endemic - epidemic modelling enabled us to analyse disease spread between age groups 9 which we believe is a necessary inclusion in any model seeking to achieve our goal . So - 10 phisticated time - varying contact matrices encapsulating four different contact settings 11 were included in our complex statistical modelling approach to reflect the amount of 12 school closure in place on a given day . Using the model , we projected case counts un - 13 der various transmission scenarios ( driven by implemented social distancing policies ) . 14 We compared these counterfactual scenarios against the true levels of social distanc - 15 ing policies implemented , where schools closed in the spring and reopened in the au - 16 tumn . We found that if schools had been kept open , the vast majority of additional 17 cases would be expected among primary school - aged children with a small fraction of 18 cases percolating into other age groups following the contact matrix structure . Under 19 this scenario where schools were kept open , the cases were highly concentrated among 20 the youngest age group . In the scenario where schools had remained closed , most re - 21 duction would also be expected in the lowest age group with less effects seen in other 22 groups . 23 2 .

The implications of school closures are manifold and are 27 not restricted to changes in numbers of cases ( knock - on effects include decreased so - 28 cialisation skills among children and economic impacts through the reduced labour of 29 guardians having to shift their focus to child rearing ) meaning it is not a policy deci - 30 sion to be made lightly . As not everyone in a population attends school , we need age - 31 stratified surveillance data to answer the question of what the impact of school closure 32 is . In this work , we wish to determine the impact of school closures for COVID - 19 33 control in Switzerland though the methods are applicable to other countries . 34 In earlier work [ Bekker - Nielsen Dunbar et al . , 2022 ] we considered evidence which 35 suggested the effect of school closure in the canton of Zurich ( in terms of reduction in 36 disease transmission observed through a decrease in cases ) seemed to not be large for 37 the early coronavirus outbreak . The canton of Zurich is the most populous region of 38 Switzerland . The analysis of data from the canton of Zurich suffered from low num - 39 bers of observed cases in the youngest age group . This proof - of - concept study pro - 40 vided a starting ground for further developing the methods used to examine these 41 kinds of policy questions using endemic - epidemic models with time - varying weights . 42 We now consider a longer time frame ( until the end of 2020 ) and a greater popula - 43 tion ( the whole of Switzerland ) . This also allows us to evaluate the performance of 44 the analysis at a greater resolution . Considering cases at national level rather than re - 45 gional level induces additional challenges as social distancing policy varies across the 46 country . As our study is not stratified by geographical region – our focus is age groups – 47 these differences in policy need to be incorporated . Here we showcase how to incorpo - 48 3 .

It is a versatile frameworkmodel 52 which has been applied to the analysis of many disease outbreaks with varying char - 53 acteristics . Endemic - epidemic modelling is considered a useful tool for emergency re - 54 sponse related to infectious disease outbreaks as it fulfils many of the requirements 55 for disaster response models raised by Brandeau et al . [ 2009 ] . In particular , endemic - 56 epidemic modelling addresses real - world infectious disease problems such as detection 57 of outbreaks and populations at increased risk and is designed for maximum usability 58 by response planners by virtue of being released as open source publications and soft - 59 ware which means we avoid issues with disease knowledge being pay - walled during on - 60 going outbreaks as seen in the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak [ Dahn et al . , 2015 ] . 61 The framework also makes a good compromise between simplicity and complexity , 62 and due to its statistical nature is designed in a manner which captures inherent un - 63 certainties . Endemic - epidemic modelling facilitates knowing when disease is endemic 64 ( prevalence levels are in the range of expected values ) and when disease is epidemic 65 ( incidence is higher than expected ) , at which point control measures may need intro - 66 ducing or intensifying . This work provides an insight into how control measures can 67 be incorporated in endemic - epidemic models through the inclusion of time - varying 68 contact matrices . 69 To accomplish our goal , we fit an endemic - epidemic model to a multivariate time 70 series of age - stratified COVID - 19 cases in Switzerland and then examine two coun - 71 terfactual scenarios of the policy implemented ; the true school closures consisted of 72 schools being closed early in the year and reopening for the second half of the year 73 ( scenario A ) . We consider the counterfactual scenarios where schools did not close ( al - 74 4 .

The additional scenario is possible due to the 76 longer time frame considered in this work . Scenario B is similar to the scenario consid - 77 ered in our earlier analysis . 78 2 Methods 79 This work is preregistered and has a study protocol [ Bekker - Nielsen Dunbar et al . , 80 2022 ] which is considered a useful manner of working but currently rare in epidemic 81 modelling . The protocol outlines the modelling considerations we made before work 82 began and may serve as a useful resource for the interested reader . 83 2 . 1 Data 84 In this work we consider daily data ( t = 1 , . . . , 312 = T ) where the study period 85 commences on 24 th February 2020 and the final observation at time T occurs on 31 st 86 December 2020 . COVID - 19 case data is provided by the Swiss public health author - 87 ity ( Bundesamt für Gesundheit ) and includes case counts by date reported stratified 88 by age group . We asked for cases given by the same age groups we considered in our 89 Zurich analysis as this roughly divides the population into those of compulsory educa - 90 tion age ( 0 – 14 year olds are required to be in school when school is open ) , higher edu - 91 cation and young workers ( 15 – 24 ) , parents ( 25 – 44 ) , middle - aged workers ( 45 – 65 ) , re - 92 tirees ( 66 – 79 ) , and the elderly ( 80 + ) . Our age group thresholds include the commonly 93 used cut - off of 65 years of age considered in epidemiology , when health is expected to 94 change . 95 5 .

The upper panel shows 98 the oscillatory behaviour known to epidemic curves as well as weekly systematic fluc - 99 tuations in surveillance . The middle panel shows a shift in the age distribution of 100 cases across the study period which further motivates the inclusion of age groups in 101 our modelling approach . The lower panel shows the distribution of cases across the 102 days of the week , where we see a systematic fluctuation in the reporting system . The 103 legal workdays in Switzerland are Monday through Friday . Most cases are reported on 104 Mondays which is the start of the week according to European norms and the number 105 of reported cases drops across the week while fewer cases are reported on weekends 106 ( Saturday and Sunday ) . 107 To capture baseline transmission opportunities between age groups we include a 108 contact matrix in our endemic - epidemic model . Contact matrices encapsulate the 109 number of contacts an average person in the population has with other population 110 members of the same and different ages in different settings such as the workplace 111 or school . Their inclusion in the endemic - epidemic framework was an approach in - 112 troduced by Meyer and Held [ 2017 ] which provided more realism than making an as - 113 sumption of mixing patterns for the population . Existing contact diary - based contact 114 matrices for Switzerland are only based on a small number of observations ( 54 obser - 115 vations ) [ Hoang et al . , 2019 ] , which led us to use a synthetic contact matrix in place 116 of this empirical one . A synthetic contact matrix is constructed on the basis of demo - 117 graphic information . We chose to use the synthetic matrices by Mistry et al . [ 2021 ] 118 as they were both 1 ) newer and 2 ) given with a certain level of uncertainty which we 119 could incorporate into our modelling approach . The synthetic contact matrix is con - 120 structed on the basis of household size , school enrolment records , and employment 121 6 .

This 127 means school has the largest weight and so changes to these contacts are expected to 128 have the biggest impact . These construction weights d s are provided with standard 129 errors . When constructing c a , a ′ we used the Swiss population ( Table 1 ) rather than 130 the Zurich population which we considered in earlier work [ see Bekker - Nielsen Dun - 131 bar et al . , 2022 , for the analysis of Zurich ] such that the population used to weight the 132 synthetic contact matrix was the one being studied . This means the contact matrix 133 used in this work is not exactly the same as the one considered previously . The Mis - 134 try et al . [ 2021 ] contact matrices are created with respiratory diseases in mind where 135 school closure is a first line of defence against disease outbreaks . The synthetic con - 136 tact matrix was used to inform the time - varying transmission weights w a , a ′ , t which 137 determine the amount of transmission between age group a and age group a ′ at time t , 138 which is explained in more detail below . 139 Contact setting - specific daily policy adjustments p s , t are informed by information 140 provided by the Swiss authorities . This information is used to quantify the amount of 141 disease control measures enacted . We focus on those measures which have the aim 142 to decrease contact . Following the Oxford University policy classifications we con - 143 sider : school closure ( “C1” ) , workplace closure ( “C2” ) , and restrictions on gatherings 144 ( “C4” ) . We code our policy indicators to take the same levels as the Oxford scheme 145 allowing researchers familiar with the controlled vocabulary established by that re - 146 search group to comprehend our indicators . We reversed and rescaled the indicators 147 8 .

These closures reduce contact independently of disease control measures ; 154 notably Easter is a period where less contacts in school settings would be expected 155 as Switzerland is a predominantly Christian country . The adjustment takes values 156 h s , t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] where 0 means that all schools in Switzerland are closed on that day and 157 1 means all schools are open . The values h s , t takes for the school setting are shown in 158 Figure 3 while h s , t ≡ 1 for all other contact settings ( meaning no adjustment ) . The 159 calculation of h s , t is informed by population data from Eurostat [ Eurostat , 2021 ] ( pop - 160 ulation by region ) . The construction of p s , t , h s , t , and w a , a ′ , t is explained in more detail 161 in the following section . 162 163 10 .

The age groups considered are 0 – 14 , 15 – 24 , 25 – 44 , 45 – 65 , 66 – 79 , and 80 + years ; 166 the same used in Bekker - Nielsen Dunbar et al . [ 2022 ] . Case counts given past cases as - 167 sumed to follow an overdispersed negative binomial distribution with age - dependent 168 overdispersion parameters ψ a . The mean λ at is additively decomposed into endemic 169 and epidemic components . Log - linear predictors for the endemic and epidemic com - 170 ponents are given by ν at and ϕ at respectively . The endemic component is additionally 171 weighted by population fractions e a , where we used population data from Eurostat 172 [ 2021 ] ( population by age group ) , given in Table 1 to inform this part of the model . 173 The epidemic component is an autoregressive process driven by cases in other 174 age groups a ′ in previous time periods t − d up to a maximum lag of d max where u d 175 determines by how much previous cases are weighted . We chose to use a Poisson - 176 distributed lag distribution u d such that the majority of the weight need not be given 177 to the immediately preceeding cases allowing for a serial interval of more than a single 178 day . The maximum lag represents the maximum length of the serial interval we might 179 conceive in our modelling efforts ; we chose d max = 7 as the literature suggests early 180 types of COVID - 19 have a serial interval within a week . 181 Our endemic - epidemic model with time dependent [ Bekker - Nielsen Dunbar et al . , 182 2022 , Grimée et al . , 2021 ] contact matrix weights [ Meyer and Held , 2017 ] and higher 183 order lag [ Bracher and Held , 2022 ] is given by 184 12 .

It is created from the combination of the weights used to 189 construct contact matrices ( d s given by Mistry et al . [ 2021 ] which depend on setting 190 s ) , the time - dependent setting - specific policy adjustments ( p s , t which depend on time 191 t and setting s ) and whether an adjustment needs to be made to incorporate non - 192 pandemic school closure due to school holidays ( h s , t which depends on setting s as it 193 only affects schools and time t ) : 194 γ s , t = d s · p s , t · h s , t ( 3 ) Since school holidays in Switzerland vary not only between regions , but also within 195 them , we construct binary indicators for all of the sub - regions r within a region R 196 where we assign 1 to a specific day t if t is not a school holiday and 0 otherwise .

Subsequently , we use popu - 199 lation weights to calculate the national indicator h s , t . The sub - regions are unweighted 200 in our averaging as we were not able to determine population sizes at school district 201 level . We calculate 202 h s , t = 8 > > < > > : P R ∑ r ∈ R 1 { t is not a school holiday in subregion r } ( t ) / n r ( R ) population R s = school 1 otherwise ( 4 ) where 1 is an indicator function and n r ( R ) denotes the number of sub - regions 203 within region R . This gives us a population - weighted indicator with values h s , t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] 204 which incorporates the variation of number of school children in regions . 205 We fit the model ( 1 ) with predictors 206 log ( ν at ) = α ( ν ) a + β ( ν ) 1 x 1 t + β ( ν ) 2 x 2 t + γ ( ν ) sin ( 2 πt / 365 + δ ( ν ) ) ( 5 ) log ( ϕ at ) = α ( ϕ ) a + β ( ϕ ) 1 x 1 t + β ( ϕ ) 2 z t + γ ( ϕ ) sin ( 2 πt / 365 + δ ( ϕ ) ) where α a denotes a fixed effect of age group a , x 1 t is an indicator for public hol - 207 idays , x 2 t is an indicator for weekends , and z t are effect - coded weekday effects with 208 Monday as the reference value ( six in total ) . Effect - coded variables are also known as 209 sum - to - zero contrasts . This means Monday always takes the value − 1 and the week - 210 day of interest takes the value 1 while all other weekdays are 0 . We include a non - 211 linear time trend in the form of a sine - cosine wave expressed by its amplitude γ and 212 phase δ [ Paul et al . , 2008 ] .

As the outbreak is ongoing , the predicted 220 final size considered here is the predicted number of infections over the time window 221 considered rather than the traditional metric considered by users of compartmental 222 models : the total number of infections over the entire outbreak period . Predicted 223 cases are based on a path trajectory ( a long - term expected prediction calculated re - 224 cursively on the basis of one - step predictions ) following Held et al . [ 2017 ] assuming no 225 changes to the model parameters across the scenarios considered . This means we pre - 226 dict the model ( 1 ) with the given e a and fitted ˆ ν at , ˆ ϕ at , and ˆ u d effects for three differ - 227 ent versions of w a , a ′ , t ( for scenarios A , B , and C ) . The two counterfactual scenarios are 228 implemented by including transmission weights informed by γ s , t , a , a ′ = d s · q s , t , a , a ′ · h s , t 229 where γ now depends on age group . In particular we consider three scenarios ( pro - 230 vided with the shorthand names we use based on their effect on the youngest age 231 group ) : 232 Scenario A ( “true measures” ) This is the true measures scenario where schools 233 closed in the spring and reopened in the summer where w a , a ′ , t is populated by 234 the relevant policy information without adjustment as in ( 2 ) . This is the same 235 scenario considered in model fitting to obtain the model coeﬀicients used in pre - 236 diction of final size and simulation of uncertainty for the prediction . 237 Scenario B ( “schools open” ) This is a scenario where schools are never closed for 238 15 .

School closure once again affects age group 0 – 14 and their contacts . All 242 other measures are as in Scenario A . We implement this by setting 243 q a , t , a , a ′ = 8 > > > > > > < > > > > > > : p s , t t < t 0 and a = 0 – 14 or a ′ = 0 – 14 and s = school p s , t a ̸ = 0 – 14 and a ′ ̸ = 0 – 14 and s = school 0 t ≥ t 0 and a = 0 – 14 or a ′ = 0 – 14 and s = school ( 7 ) where t 0 denotes the date schools are first closed ( 16 th March 2020 ) . 244 The changes only affect age group 0 – 14 when the contact matrix is multiplied by 245 γ s , t , a , a ′ so the 0 – 14 row and column in Figure 2 are changed in the school setting ( school 246 aged children and their contacts ) . The time series of all four setting specific policy in - 247 dicators p s , t for the different scenarios can be seen in Figure ? ? ( the building blocks 248 of ( 2 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) ) . The truth ( scenario A ) is expected to lie somewhere between the two 249 counterfactual scenarios ( scenarios B and C ) . Examining the deviation these scenarios 250 have allows use to evaluate the effect of disease control measures used . It is implicitly 251 assumed that the fitted effects ˆ ν at , ˆ ϕ at , ˆ u d do not vary across scenarios . 252 To incorporate parameter uncertainty in our projections , we utilise Monte Carlo 253 simulation . We sample the weights d s with uncertainty estimates given in Mistry et al . 254 16 .

To incorporate model 255 uncertainty we sample the coeﬀicients ˆ ν at , ˆ ϕ at of our fitted endemic - epidemic model 256 assuming a multivariate normal distribution ; the asymptomatic normal distribution 257 of the maximum - likelihood estimates . Using these n = 1000 samples we then use the 258 path trajectory prediction approach to obtain n simulated expected case counts under 259 the scenarios considered . This enables us to incorporate uncertainty in our projections . 260 We examine the expected increase in cases when schools are always open ( scenario B ) 261 and the expected decrease in cases when schools are always closed ( scenario C ) and 262 compare this with the expected number of cases under the policy used ( scenario A ) . 263 We also conducted sensitivity analyses of the assumptions made in constructing 264 the transmission weights w a , a ′ , t . The sensitivity analyses attempt to provide further re - 265 alism with respect to how household contacts may be affected by school closure . This 266 provides additional extensions to the analysis of Zurich data as here we only consid - 267 ered household contacts to not be affected by policy p s , t | household ≡ 1 . The sensitivity 268 analyses can be found in the supporting information . 269 3 Results 270 In total 256 models were fit to the outbreak data and Bayesian information criterion 271 was used as a goodness - of - fit measure to determine the best fitting model ( see the 272 supporting information for details ) . We chose this as Bayesian information criterion 273 should fit the correct model in theory while Akaike information criterion would be ex - 274 pected to overfit . Due to diverging estimates in the model – likely due to low values in 275 the transmission weights matrix w a , a ′ , t or low case counts Y at observed in certain age 276 groups – models which did not have converging effects were excluded from the selection 277 process . Divergence was determined on the basis of the size of the standard deviation 278 17 .

It may happen that the additive decomposition 279 into endemic and epidemic components is not identifiable . 280 In particular , α ( ν ) 80 + ( the fixed effect of the oldest age group in the endemic com - 281 ponent ) was excluded due to having a very small estimate with a huge standard er - 282 ror . This means the coeﬀicient α ( ν ) 80 + was restricted to be zero on the log - scale while 283 the corresponding epidemic effect α ( ϕ ) 80 + was estimated from the data . The best fitting 284 model has 31 parameters including the lag parameter κ . The model contains system - 285 atic fluctuations in the form of weekly effects , as we expected based on the exploration 286 of the case data , and additional fluctuations in the form of the sine - cosine waves . As 287 we only use one year’s worth of data in this work , we cannot denote this fluctuating 288 trend “seasonality” but with a longer time frame it would be expected to capture such 289 effects . There is not much knowledge about seasonal variation of COVID - 19 at the 290 time of analysis so we note that with only one harmonic in the epidemic component 291 and not even a whole year of data , this may induce additional uncertainty in our sim - 292 ulations and predictions . 293 3 . 1 Model fit 294 The model has a good fit to the case data based on visual inspection ( Figure 4 up - 295 per panel ) . The serial interval peaks somewhat early ( Figure 4 lower panel ) compared 296 with what is expected from the literature . This has been observed in other endemic - 297 epidemic models for COVID - 19 and is thus likely an artefact of the model . The model 298 estimates fewer cases on public holidays and weekends , which aligns with our intuition 299 based on the exploratory data analysis of the case counts . 300 There are much greater effects of age in the endemic component , exp ( α ( ν ) ) ranges 301 from 9 . 450 to 130 . 061 ( and α ( ν ) ≡ 1 ) compared with the epidemic component where 302 18 .

The sine - cosine wave 309 takes greater amplitude values in the endemic component , meaning the wave has stronger 310 variation ( relative to the baseline ) .

Scenarios A and C differ with regards to when schools are closed . They show 325 much more distinct behaviour for school - aged children . We see the difference in pat - 326 terns for age group 0 – 14 seems to be correlated with school holidays h s , t ( Figure 3 ) . 327 The final epidemic size estimates ( with uncertainty bounds ) within each scenario 328 are given in Figure 6 and are calculated by summing the predicted number of cases 329 across the 90 day projection window .

We discuss the diﬀiculties of forecasting in more detail in our 334 discussion . We are most interested in the ratio between the predicted case counts : the 335 percentage increase and decrease in cases is approximately ten per cent for both sce - 336 narios ( the ratio is 1 . 11 for scenario B and 0 . 99 for scenario C ) . Most of the effect is 337 found among the youngest group , which have 82 per cent more cases for scenario B 338 and 8 per cent fewer cases for scenario C . The relative difference in expected cases be - 339 tween scenarios A and B suggests that case numbers would not have increased a lot of 340 schools were left open and regarding scenario C , as expected ; closing schools decreases 341 cases . 342 4 Discussion 343 In our earlier work attempting to provide evidence - based information for policy mak - 344 ers , we found than an endemic - epidemic model ( a two - component model for infectious 345 disease ) provided a good fit for data from Zurich , Switzerland [ Bekker - Nielsen Dunbar 346 et al . , 2022 ] . The model had effects of day of the week , public holidays , testing rate , 347 and age in the endemic components and the same effects as well as a centred linear 348 time trend in the endemic component . This model suggested if there was no school 349 closure , an increase in cases would be expected in the youngest age group ( 0 – 14 ) in 350 April and later in other age groups , with the next age group expected to experience 351 an increase in cases compared with the true school closure implemented being the par - 352 ents of the first age group ( 25 – 44 ; parents ) . In this work , the main group of concern 353 was the oldest age group ( 80 + ) and they were found to be consistently the lowest in 354 terms of expected increase in cases compared with what was expected when schools 355 24 .

Here we extended this work further motivated by the fact the useful - 356 ness of school closure to combat COVID - 19 was not fully determined by end of the 357 “first wave” . Schools in Switzerland re - opened after the summer of 2020 but at the 358 time questions of whether to close them remained . In our work we were able to ex - 359 amine school closure at greater spatial and temporal scale than previously which is 360 a strength of the approach . Other countries were observed to have different levels of 361 school closure during the study period compared with Switzerland and so the “ideal” 362 amount of closure remains to be determined . We note that school closures are a pri - 363 mary measure for disease control but other measures such as masked students or vac - 364 cinated students which seek to reduce within - class disease risk may be a better op - 365 tion later in the outbreak [ Endo et al . , 2021 ] . We remain cognisant that the purpose 366 of school is not just educational and it is important to investigate the impact of this 367 as the knock - on effects to children’s health of remote learning are expected to be a 368 topic of interest for years to come . While the current work considers only the options 369 of schools open or closed , the methodology used could also be used to examine use 370 of masks in educational settings , provided evidence is available to inform the time - 371 varying transmission weights and so is very versatile . 372 In the age group 80 + we find that incidence is completely explained by the epi - 373 demic component ϕ so the endemic component was not identifiable and diverged . It is 374 not ideal that α ( ν ) 80 + was restricted to be zero but the alternative approach of setting all 375 α ( ν ) values to be the same would also not have been ideal since the results imply they 376 differ across age groups ( Table 2 ) . The analysis we present is ecological as we aggre - 377 gated our indicators across the federation of Switzerland although they differ across 378 regions . Ideally we would have liked to have done a spatio - temporal analysis across 379 age groups but as we were interested in specific age groups rather than ten - year age 380 bands , we had to choose to focus on age over age and space . 381 25 .

Sce - 382 nario C has more data to predict in the one - step prediction approach used to calculate 383 this mean due to its prediction window starting later . We suspect fewer cases early 384 on in the study period to be the cause of more uncertainty in the left panels of Fig - 385 ure 5 . There is less uncertainty on the predictions in scenario C but we also observed 386 fewer cases ( the incidence was low in the summer ) . Due to the time - sensitive nature of 387 the policy questions being considered , the focus of this work was not calibration ( the 388 match of observations and predictions ) but rather the differences in scenarios . How - 389 ever , we note that there are greater discrepancies between the predicted number of 390 cases and the true number of cases for the real scenario in the analysis of scenario B 391 ( Figure 6 ) . Scenario B underestimates the number of cases while Scenario C some - 392 times overestimates the number while the total number of observed cases is within the 393 predictions . The predicted means are made on the basis of the same model which was 394 fit over the entire study period ( Figure 1 ) . The reason for predicting a 90 day window 395 rather than the entire year is that we find it unlikely that a decision maker at a public 396 health agency would not revisit a decision made within a 90 day period , so predicting 397 cases until the end of the period the model is fit on strikes us as a less useful exer - 398 cise . Additionally the biology of the disease changed due to a different variant of the 399 disease becoming dominant ( “delta” / B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) in the ecological niche and this infor - 400 mation is not included in our modelling work . Indeed , the model does not have change 401 points and the large increase in cases at the end of the study period ( which the model 402 is fit to ) might influence its ability to predict lower case counts . 403 We briefly summarise the comparison of results with the Zurich analysis [ see Bekker - 404 Nielsen Dunbar et al . , 2022 , for details ] . By virtue of the shorter time frame of the 405 earlier analysis , we are unable to note similarities and differences with scenario C as 406 this information is not available at Zurich level . The model for Zurich contains more 407 26 .

The Zurich model has β ( ν ) weekdays , β ( ϕ ) t , β ( ν ) testing rate , 408 and β ( ν ) testing rate . Notably , the Zurich analysis has additional time effects while our cur - 409 rent model only contains a non - linear time trend in the form of the sine - cosine waves . 410 While the models are different , the estimated discrete - time serial interval ˆ u d is sim - 411 ilar . Some of the building blocks used to construct the models are the same for the 412 two studies : p s , t and d s are the same in the two studies . The relative increase ( de - 413 termined by calculating the ratio of predicted cases under scenario B and scenario 414 A ) takes values closer to 1 ( no difference ) for all age groups but the youngest . For 415 Zurich the relative increase in these age groups is no more than five per cent , while 416 it is slightly larger for the current work ( ranging from 1 . 05 to 1 . 82 compared to 1 . 01 417 to 1 . 05 ) . Many of the P 90 values in Table 3 are a ten - fold increase with those found 418 for Zurich . The ratio for the youngest age group ( 0 – 14 ) is much greater in the current 419 work with no overlap with the values found in the previous work . 420 Finally we note that the existence of pharmaceutical countermeasures does not 421 guarantee their use . Vaccines are recommended to prevent disease , disability , and 422 death in children [ World Health Organization , 2022 ] . However , with novel vaccines 423 for pandemic control , children may be included in secondary but not primary trials 424 and so may not be included in immunisation programmes as soon as a prophylaxis is 425 tested safe and made available to the population . For this reason , we believe gaining 426 an understanding of the impact of school closures in the absence of vaccine to still be 427 an interesting and relevant area of research . 428 Data Availability Statement 429 The protocol for this study can be accessed at https : / / osf . io / fgrdy which includes 430 description of where to source data used .
