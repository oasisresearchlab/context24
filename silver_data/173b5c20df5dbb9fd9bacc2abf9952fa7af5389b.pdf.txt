Lomonosov Moscow State University , 119991 Moscow , Russia ABSTRACT Eukaryotic cells are defined by extensive intracellular compartmentalization , which requires dynamic membrane remodeling . FER / Cip4 homology - Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( F - BAR ) domain family proteins form crescent - shaped dimers , which can bend membranes into buds and tubules of defined geometry and lipid composition . However , these proteins exhibit an unexplained wide diversity of membrane - deforming activities in vitro and functions in vivo . We find that the F - BAR domain of the neuronal protein Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) has a novel higher - order structure and membrane - deforming activity that distinguishes it from pre - viously described F - BAR proteins . The Nwk F - BAR domain assembles into zigzags , creating ridges and periodic scallops on membranes in vitro . This activity depends on structural deter - minants at the tips of the F - BAR dimer and on electrostatic interactions of the membrane with the F - BAR concave surface . In cells , Nwk - induced scallops can be extended by cytoskeletal forces to produce protrusions at the plasma membrane . Our results define a new F - BAR membrane - deforming activity and illustrate a molecular mechanism by which positively curved F - BAR domains can produce a variety of membrane curvatures . These findings expand the repertoire of F - BAR domain mediated membrane deformation and suggest that unique modes of higher - order assembly can define how these proteins sculpt the membrane . INTRODUCTION Intracellular traffic is regulated by the activities of dozens of mem - brane - remodeling proteins that act together to invaginate , tubu - late , and vesiculate membrane compartments . Many of these pro - teins contain Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) domains , which form a crescent - shaped dimer that binds to and bends the lipid bilayer . Based on sequence homology and available crystal structures , three BAR domain subfamilies have been defined : 1 ) conventional BAR domains , which are sharply concave , 2 ) FER / Cip4 homology BAR ( F - BAR ) domains , which are gently concave , and 3 ) IRSp53 - MIM homology BAR ( I - BAR ) domains , which are convex ( Masuda and Mochizuki , 2010 ) . Current models suggest that concave BAR do - mains generate curvature toward the protein - decorated face of the membrane ( positive curvature ) , whereas convex I - BAR domains generate curvature away from the protein - decorated face ( negative curvature ) . However , the situation is likely more complex . Even for members of the F - BAR domain subfamily , there is significant diver - sity in membrane - deforming activities . For example , Cip4 / formin - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) generates invaginating tubules that shape endocytic buds ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Frost et al . , 2008 ) , whereas Slit / Robo GTPase - activating proteins ( SRGAPs ) generate plasma membrane protrusions when expressed in heterologous cells via what is termed inverted F - BAR ( IF - BAR ) activity . This IF - BAR activity is required for the physiological function of SRGAPs in generating protrusive neuronal structures such as neurites and dendritic spines , analogous to their activities in heterologous cellular assays ( Guerrier et al . , 2009 ; Carlson et al . , 2011 ) . Little is known about how this mechanistic diversity is achieved among otherwise highly related proteins , which leaves a fundamental gap in our understanding of how specialized compart - mentalization is regulated in cells .

Volume 24 August 1 , 2013 Novel mode of membrane remodeling by Nwk | 2407 in S2 cells ( Nwk 1 - 428 ) . Nwk 1 - 428 exhibited the same protrusion - gener - ating activity as the F - BAR fragment alone ( Nwk 1 - 324 ) , indicating that the C - terminal extension does not significantly alter the membrane - deforming activity of Nwk ( Figure 1 , A and B ) . We chose to focus our studies on this longer fragment , as Nwk 1 - 428 was more amenable to biochemical purification than Nwk 1 - 324 ( see later discussion ) . We next sought to establish the origin of the cellular protrusions in Nwk F - BAR – expressing cells . Nwk F - BAR protrusions formed steadily from small cellular buds ( Figure 1C and Supplemental Movie S1 ) , indicating that they are bona fide extensions and not the result of lamellipodial retraction . The actin cytoskeleton extended into Nwk F - BAR – induced protrusions , as revealed by phalloidin staining , but not along Cip4 F - BAR – induced intracellular tubules ( Supple - mental Figure S1A ) , indicating that actin recruitment is specific to Nwk - induced membrane deformations and not a general feature of isolated F - BAR domains . Finally , we tested whether the protrusion - generating activity of the Nwk F - BAR domain is evolutionarily conserved . As with Drosophila Nwk , the F - BAR domains of both murine Nwk homo - logues , FCHSD1 and FCHSD2 , formed abundant protrusions in S2 cells ( Figure 1 , A and B ) . Further , expression of FCHSD1 1 - 417 , FCHSD2 1 - 414 , and Drosophila Nwk 1 - 428 in human HEK293T cells re - sulted in pronounced F - actin – containing protrusions to which the F - BAR domains localized ( Figure 1D ) , indicating that the unex - pected protrusion - generating activity of the Nwk F - BAR domain is evolutionarily conserved . Thus , Nwk displays IF - BAR activity , gen - erating negative deformations of the plasma membrane in heter - ologous cell assays . Interestingly , the BAR domains of Nwk , Synd , Cip4 , and Mim segregated very strongly away from each other when coexpressed pairwise in cells ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) , even those of Synd and Cip4 , which are predicted to form membrane tubules of simi - lar diameter . Further , the I - BAR domain of MIM was excluded from the ends of Nwk F - BAR – induced protrusions ( Supplemental Figure S1C ) , suggesting that Mim is unable to coassemble or com - pete with Nwk on the membrane . Thus , different BAR domains assemble on distinct cellular membranes and have highly specific activities , even in heterologous cells . This indicates that the unique properties of each BAR domain , in the absence of additional anchoring sequences in the remainder of the protein , are sufficient to direct specific membrane - deforming activities . The Nwk F - BAR binds charged liposomes We next purified the F - BAR domain of Nwk to determine whether its unexpected IF - BAR activity was due to differences in lipid - bind - ing properties relative to positive curvature - generating F - BAR pro - teins such as Cip4 and Synd . Although the core F - BAR sequence encoded by Nwk 1 - 324 induced protrusions when expressed in S2 cells ( Figure 1 , A and B ) , this and several other fragments terminat - ing between amino acids 324 and 428 were not soluble when expressed in Escherichia coli . However , Nwk 1 - 428 was soluble and migrated as a single peak of the expected dimer radius by gel filtra - tion ( data not shown ) . We therefore pursued biochemical character - ization of this longer fragment . F - BAR domains have varied binding affinities for charged phospholipids , particularly phosphoinositides ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) , which may be an important factor for their distinct membrane - deforming properties . Cosedimentation of Nwk 1 - 428 with purified liposomes was enhanced by high concen - trations of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , which has low negative charge , with maximal binding at ∼ 50 % PS , and by low concentrations of phosphoinositides ( 5 % ) , which have high negative charge Although the membrane - binding properties of individual BAR dimers are important for their localization and function , higher - order oligomerization also plays a key role in the shape and properties of BAR - induced membrane structures . For example , the F - BAR do - main of FBP17 polymerizes end to end to form filaments that wrap around the membrane , producing a helical coat on lipid tubules ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Frost et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , the BAR protein endophilin forms a struc - tured coat on membrane tubules with limited direct interactions be - tween adjacent BAR dimers ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) . It remains unclear whether and how other members of the BAR protein family oli - gomerize into higher - order structures to induce deformations at a larger scale than the individual dimer . nervous wreck ( nwk ) encodes a conserved F - BAR and Src ho - mology 3 ( SH3 ) domain – containing protein that regulates the en - dosomal traffic and signaling output of synaptic growth receptors at the presynaptic terminal of the Drosophila neuromuscular junc - tion ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ; O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ; Rodal et al . , 2011 ) . Here we find that the N - terminal F - BAR domain of Nwk has a novel membrane - deforming activity that distinguishes it from previously described BAR proteins . Instead of inward or outward cylindrical membrane tubules , Nwk induces membrane scallops in vitro , which can be amplified by the cytoskeleton into membrane protrusions in cells . Our results suggest that these membrane scal - lops are a product of membrane ridging through a unique zigzag structure formed on the membrane by oligomerized Nwk F - BAR domain dimers . RESULTS The Nwk F - BAR domain forms cellular protrusions Heterologous cellular assays have been extremely informative for defining the membrane - deforming activities of diverse BAR do - mains when uncoupled from their regulators ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Guerrier et al . , 2009 ) . We investigated the activ - ity of the Nwk F - BAR domain in Drosophila S2 cells , which do not express detectable endogenous nwk transcript ( Cherbas et al . , 2011 ) . In this assay , the isolated F - BAR domains of Drosophila Cip4 and Syndapin ( Synd ) decorated long intracellular membrane invagi - nations and reticular structures , respectively , consistent with their canonical F - BAR activity ( Figure 1 , A and B ; Fricke et al . , 2009 ; Kumar et al . , 2009 ) . In striking contrast , the F - BAR domain of Nwk ( Nwk 1 - 324 ) induced extensive plasma membrane protrusions , to which Nwk 1 - 324 localized ( Figure 1 , A and B ) . These were reminiscent of the membrane protrusions generated by the I - BAR domain of Mim ( Figure 1 , A and B ; Quinones et al . , 2010 ) . Importantly , S2 cells are generally resistant to forming projections ( Biyasheva et al . , 2004 ) and never exhibit significant protrusions in the presence of EGFP alone , Cip4 , or Synd , suggesting a specific difference between Nwk F - BAR and Cip4 / Synd F - BAR activities in this assay . Thus , the isolated F - BAR domain of Nwk can generate negative membrane curvature . The negative membrane deformation activity of the Nwk F - BAR domain is similar to that of SRGAPs , which phenotypically mimic I - BAR proteins , though they bear no detectable sequence homology and phylogenetically are members of the F - BAR family . SRGAP IF - BAR domains contain a C - terminal α - helical extension , which is required for their IF - BAR activity ( Guerrier et al . , 2009 ; Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2010 ) . To determine the role of the α - helical extension C ter - minal to the Nwk F - BAR , which is highly conserved among Nwk ho - mologues but bears no primary sequence similarity to those found in SRGAPs ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) , we expressed a fragment of Nwk encompassing both the F - BAR domain and the helical region 2408 | A . N . Becalska et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell affinity for more charged phosphoinositides ( Figure 2B ) . Addition - ally , sedimentation of Nwk 1 - 428 with liposomes was sensitive to high concentrations of salt ( Figure 2C ) , further suggesting that Nwk binds to the membrane primarily via electrostatic interac - tions like other F - BAR proteins . ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . Quantification of the effect of PS on Nwk 1 - 428 binding revealed a sigmoidal curve with a Hill coefficient of 2 . 4 , suggesting cooperative binding similar to conventional F - BAR proteins ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . Nwk 1 - 428 did not exhibit strong specific - ity for any particular phosphoinositide species , but had increased FIGURE 1 : The Nwk F - BAR domain generates protrusions in S2 and human cells .

Volume 24 August 1 , 2013 Novel mode of membrane remodeling by Nwk | 2409 Nwk causes membrane flattening on giant unilamellar vesicles We next compared the morphology of li - posomes incubated with Nwk and Cip4 F - BAR domains by negative stain electron microscopy ( EM ) . Whereas Cip4 1 - 312 gen - erated extensive membrane tubules , as previously reported ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) , Nwk 1 - 428 caused only subtle indentations on liposomes ( Figure 3A , arrows ) . Therefore , despite similar lipid - binding properties , Nwk does not share the membrane - deforming proper - ties of Cip4 . To directly compare the membrane - deforming activity of the Nwk F - BAR domain to canonical F - BARs and I - BARs , we examined their effects on giant unila - mellar vesicles ( GUVs ) , which permit the visualization of membrane deformations in real time . Consistent with their known activities , the F - BAR domain of Synd gen - erated abundant thin membrane protru - sions and asters within minutes of incuba - tion with GUVs , whereas the Mim I - BAR domain generated invaginations ( Figure 3 , B and C ) . In contrast to both Synd and Mim , Nwk induced flattening and pinching of the membrane ( Figure 3 , B and C ) , as well as clustering of GUVs ( Figure 3D ) . Further , Nwk - decorated re - gions of the GUV excluded or exhibited reduced nitrobenzoxadiazole dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine ( NBD - PE ) fluo - rescence ( Figure 3B ) . This may be due to the recruitment of charged phospholipids such as PS and phosphoinositides to Nwk - decorated regions , as previously observed for BAR and I - BAR family members ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) , resulting in ex - clusion of less highly charged lipids like NBD - PE . To test whether the novel membrane - deforming activity of the Nwk F - BAR do - main is observed for full - length Nwk , we purified Nwk 1 - 754 , which is the longest frag - ment amenable to purification , contains both SH3 domains , and complements the nwk null mutant phenotype in Drosophila ( Rodal et al . , 2008 ) . Nwk 1 - 754 cosedimented with charged liposomes ( Supplemental Figure S2A ) , albeit with a lower affinity than Nwk 1 - 428 ( perhaps due to partial autoinhibition as observed with other F - BAR proteins ; Rao et al . , 2010 ) . On GUVs , Nwk 1 - 754 exhibited similar activity to the isolated Nwk F - BAR domain and generated kinks and membrane flattenings ( Supplemental Figure S2 , B and C ) . This suggests that the novel membrane - deforming activity of the Nwk F - BAR domain is re - tained in the physiologically relevant full - length protein . Thus , Nwk generates neither inward nor outward tubules on GUVs , but instead induces flattening and pinching of the membrane in vitro , while forming membrane protrusions with net negative curvature in cells . Some BAR domain family proteins bind preferentially to mem - branes of specific curvature . To test whether membrane curvature affects Nwk binding and may underlie its IF - BAR activity , we performed cosedimentation with Nwk 1 - 428 and liposomes of de - fined diameter . Nwk 1 - 428 bound to 50 , 200 , and 400 nm liposomes , with a slightly decreased affinity for 50 nm liposomes ( Figure 2D ) . The F - BAR domains of Synd and Mim showed a similar slight preference for larger liposomes ( Figure 2D ) . Taken together , the lipid - binding properties of Nwk ( preferential binding to charged membranes and minimal preference for membrane curvature ) do not distinguish it from conventional F - BAR proteins , and thus do not dictate its unique IF - BAR activity .

N . Becalska et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell scoring Phyre model of Nwk ( Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure S3 ) was based on the structure of FBP17 ( PDB structure 2EFL ) . Using this model , we generated targeted mutations in the Nwk F - BAR domain ( Figure 4A ) and expressed them in S2 cells to test their membrane - deforming activity . We first targeted two conserved positively charged residues in the predicted concave surface ( K46 and K47 ) that in FBP17 are important for membrane interactions ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . Mutation of these residues in Nwk 1 - 428 ( Nwk 1 - 428 K46 , 47Q ) abolished protrusion forma - tion in S2 cells , and the mutant protein local - ized to cytoplasmic puncta ( Figure 4 , B and C ) , suggesting that the conventional con - cave surface is important for IF - BAR activity . We next tested the role of the tips of the Nwk F - BAR domain in membrane binding and deformation . Lysine 166 is found at the tips of the FBP17 F - BAR domain and is in - volved in dimer – dimer interactions . Muta - tion of this residue to alanine decreases lipid - binding affinity in vitro and abolishes membrane tubulation in cells ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Frost et al . , 2008 ) . We replaced a stretch of lysines at the dimer tips of Nwk ( amino acids 181 – 189 ; Figure 4A ) with a neutral linker ( Asn - Leu ) of the length found in Drosophila Cip4 ( Nwk 1 - 428 ∆ tips ) . This mu - tant was unable to generate protrusions in S2 cells and was diffusely localized in the cy - toplasm ( Figure 4 , B and C ) , suggesting that dimer tips are also important for IF - BAR activity . To test the membrane - binding properties of Nwk 1 - 428 K46 , 47Q and Nwk 1 - 428 ∆ tips , we ex - pressed these variants tagged with EGFP and fractionated S2 cell lysates by differential centrifugation . Nwk 1 - 428 - EGFP was present in both the medium - and high - speed pellets ( Figure 4D ) . In contrast , Nwk 1 - 428 K46 , 47Q - EGFP was absent and Nwk 1 - 428 ∆ tips - EGFP was re - duced in the medium - speed pellet , consis - tent with these mutants being defective in membrane binding ( Figure 4D ) . However , both Nwk 1 - 428 K46 , 47Q - EGFP and Nwk 1 - 428 ∆ tips - EGFP pelleted at high speed , similar to Nwk 1 - 428 - EGFP , suggesting that despite re - duced membrane binding they retain either higher - order assembly properties or associa - tion with lighter membrane compartments . We purified Nwk 1 - 428 ∆ tips to directly test the lipid - binding properties of this mutant . The Nwk 1 - 428 K46 , 47Q mutant rendered Nwk 1 - 428 insoluble in E . coli , precluding its use in in vitro assays . Nwk 1 - 428 ∆ tips purified readily from E . coli , migrated indistinguish - ably from wild - type Nwk 1 - 428 through a gel filtration column , and exhibited no change in urea denaturation curves , suggesting that this protein forms a well - folded dimer ( Figure 4E ) . However , in cosedimentation assays , Nwk 1 - 428 ∆ tips required a significantly higher PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration to bind to liposomes ( Figure 4F ) . This Membrane deformation by Nwk requires its tips and a conventional F - BAR membrane - binding interface To investigate whether the structure of the Nwk F - BAR domain might direct its unusual membrane - deforming activity , we used the protein homology / analogy recognition engine program Phyre ( Kelley and Sternberg , 2009 ) to model Nwk against a fold library of all existing Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) crystal structures . The highest - FIGURE 3 : Deformation of liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles by the Nwk F - BAR domain .

Our model also suggests that Nwk retains a conventional F - BAR curvature and does not generate membrane protrusions by adopt - ing an inversely curved I - BAR – like conformation ( Figure 5A ) . To test these predictions , we compared the structures of purified Cip4 1 - 312 and Nwk 1 - 428 assembled on lipid monolayers by negative stain EM and single - particle averaging . Individual Cip4 1 - 312 particles exhibited the anticipated crescent - shaped structure ( Figure 5 , B and C ) , whereas individual Nwk 1 - 428 particles exhibited a distinct S shape ( Figure 5 , D and E ) . Our model of Nwk and the crystal structure of Cip4 , when filtered to 20 Å resolution , fit well into their respective EM projections ( Figure 5 , C and E ) . Importantly , we could distinguish convex - face - down ( S - shaped ) from concave - face - down particles ( mirror S - shaped ) due to the chirality of the S - shaped Nwk dimer . suggests either that the Nwk dimer tips are directly involved in membrane binding or that they drive higher - order association of Nwk to increase its affinity for or avidity to the membrane . Thus , mutants that disrupt either the predicted charged concave surface or the dimer tips disrupt the ability of the Nwk F - BAR to bind to and deform membranes in vitro and in vivo . Unique structural features and higher - order assemblies of Nwk Our Phyre model predicts that the distal arms of Nwk bend away from the dimer core at an angle , causing the protein to assume an S shape , similar to Synd and FCHo2 ( Masuda and Mochizuki , 2010 ) but distinct from the linear crescent shape of Cip4 . This is due to a longer α 4 helix in the distal arms of Nwk compared with FBP17 , as well as a shorter core region ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . These insertions and deletions in the α 4 helix are conserved in all Nwk FIGURE 4 : Structural determinants of Nwk F - BAR activity .

N . Becalska et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Our results suggest that Nwk exhibits a conventional , concave F - BAR domain structure but assembles in a novel and un - anticipated zigzag array on membrane monolayers . Since the concave surface of Nwk is important for membrane binding ( Figure 4 ) , this zigzag arrangement is pre - dicted to create a membrane ridge whose geometry depends on the angle between individual dimers and the frequency of concave face - to - membrane orientation of dimers in the zigzag ( Figure 5G ) . Nwk generates scalloped membrane deformations We next investigated the mechanism by which ridges generated by zigzags of the Nwk F - BAR domain could lead to mem - brane flattening and pinching in vitro and negative curvature in cells . To this end , we used cryo – EM to examine the effects of Nwk on fully hydrated liposomes at high resolution . Remarkably , we never observed smooth tubules like those generated by the BAR domains of FBP17 ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) or Mim ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . In - stead , we observed a series of membrane deformations that were never seen in the absence of Nwk . These included periodic tufts and ridges along the liposome mem - brane , and interridge membrane flattening and membrane scalloping ( Figure 6A ) . Electron - dense tufts that presumably rep - resent bound Nwk 1 - 428 were observed at scallop apices and on the surfaces of unde - formed liposomes ( Figure 6A , arrows ) , but did not exhibit sufficient order to warrant further structural analysis . Interestingly , we observed a continuum of membrane defor - mations , which are flanked by ridges or tufts and range from flattenings to scallops . To test the relationship between these de - formations , we measured the lengths of flat or scalloped membrane stretches , and found that the inter - ridge or intertuft distance was similar for flattenings , and scallops ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) . These results suggest that flattenings and scallops arise by the same mechanism , and represent a con - tinuum of membrane deformations . To examine how this novel membrane - scalloping activity relates to the membrane protrusions generated by Nwk 1 - 428 in S2 cells , we used correlative light and electron microscopy . This technique al - lowed us to identify Nwk 1 - 428 - transfected cells by live - cell fluores - cence imaging and to subsequently section and image these spe - cific cells by EM . Nwk 1 - 428 - induced protrusions were readily distinguished from the smooth lamellipodia of S2 cells ( Figure 6B ) . In addition , we observed a distinct electron - dense coat along the cortex of Nwk - expressing cells ( Figure 6B , arrows ) . Since this coat was not apparent in untransfected cells ( Figure 6B ) , it is likely to represent a Nwk F - BAR array at the plasma membrane . Remarkably , the Nwk 1 - 428 - induced protrusions were not smooth , outward - facing tubes like conventional filopodia , but instead exhibited extensive finger - like branching and scalloping of the membrane along the Nwk 1 - 428 particles were found associated with the membrane pri - marily via concave and side faces and occasionally via their convex faces ( Figure 5E ) . The use of lipid monolayers allowed us to examine higher - order organization of the F - BAR domains of Cip4 and Nwk on membranes . Cip4 1 - 312 assembled into linear filaments in which di - mers associated via tip - to - tip interactions , consistent with previ - ous observations ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Frost et al . , 2008 ; Figure 5B and inset ) . In striking contrast , Nwk 1 - 428 oligomers formed V - shaped , N - shaped , and higher - order zigzags on monolayers ( Figure 5D ) . These oligomers require membrane association , as they were not apparent in the absence of the lipid monolayer ( Supplemental Figure S4A ) . We generated separate class aver - ages of left and right Nwk dimers within each V shape . These sorted into five class averages , with interdimer angles all close to 90º ( Figure 5F ) . Within each V , one Nwk dimer was rolled from 40° to 180º relative to the other , with each V containing at least one dimer facing the membrane via its concave or side face ( Supple - mental Figure S4B - D ) .

N . Becalska et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell inward and outward tubulation and membrane flattening ( Masuda and Mochizuki , 2010 ; Pykalainen et al . , 2011 ) . Here we have found that the F - BAR domain of Nwk generates a novel mode of mem - brane deformation , characterized by membrane ridges and scal - lops . In cells , these structures are extended into plasma membrane protrusions by actin polymerization , suggesting a mechanism by which positively curved F - BAR domains can generate negative cur - vature in vivo . Structure and membrane - deforming activity of Nwk The FBP17 F - BAR and endophilin BAR domains associate end - to - end to form straight filaments , which coil into helical coats around a lipid tubule ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , using structural modeling and single - particle EM , we found that although the Nwk F - BAR domain exhibits a conventional positive F - BAR curva - ture , it assembles into novel tip - to - tip zigzag structures on membrane monolayers ( Figure 5 ) . Mutational analysis of the Nwk F - BAR in S2 cells and in vitro reveals that the concave surface of the F - BAR do - main is critical for membrane binding ( Figure 4 ) , suggesting that the Nwk F - BAR functions at least in part via a conventional membrane - binding interface , despite producing unexpected negative curvature in cells . Single - particle analyses ( Figure 5 ) indicate that Nwk dimers associate with the lipid monolayer via their concave surface ( 34 % ) but are most commonly ( ∼ 50 % ) found with their lateral side facing the monolayer . On rigid lipid bilayers , FBP17 similarly adopts a side - lying orientation , despite assembling on lipid tubules using the concave membrane - binding interface . However , tip - to - tip contacts critical to FBP17 - mediated lipid tubulation are maintained between side - lying dimers . Thus , lipid bilayers ( or monolayers in our experiments ) , con - strained against deformation , might bias the orientation of particles differently from a native , deformable bilayer , while still recapitulating features of physiological higher - order assembly . Within Nwk zigzags on monolayers , concave face - to - membrane oriented dimers always adjoined side - lying or convex face - to - mem - brane oriented dimers . One interpretation for this result is that alter - nating Nwk dimers drive membrane deformation ( via the concave face ) and zigzag assembly ( via the adjacent nonconcave face ) , re - spectively . Alternative interpretations are that the nonconcave faces of the alternating dimers are also involved in membrane binding or deformation or that constraints of the monolayer dictate Nwk orien - tation ( see earlier discussion ) . The distinct zigzag assembly of Nwk may result from the S shape of the dimer relative to the straighter conformation of the FBP17 dimer , or could be due to features spe - cific to the tips of the Nwk dimer that result in angled higher - order assembly . Our finding that the tips of the Nwk dimer are required for length of the projections ( Figure 6C ) , similar to the membrane scallops generated by Nwk 1 - 428 on liposomes in vitro ( Figure 6A , right ) . Additionally , consistent with our light microscopy data , the protrusions contained bundles of actin filaments ( Figure 6C , arrowheads ) . To compare the membrane scallops induced by the Nwk F - BAR in vitro and in vivo , we measured the vertex - to - vertex distance for Nwk 1 - 428 - induced membrane deformations in both liposomes and cellular protrusions ( Figure 6D ) . On liposomes , Nwk - induced scal - lops , membrane flattenings , and periodic tufts were spaced at short , regular intervals ( clustering closely around an average length of ∼ 70 nm ) , whereas cellular membrane scallops were longer and more variable ( average length of 153 nm , extending up to 550 nm ) . Since Nwk - induced cellular protrusions contain abundant actin filaments ( Supplemental Figure S1A ) , we tested whether their increased size relative to scallops in vitro might be due to force - generating actin polymerization . To determine the dependence of Nwk F - BAR protrusions on actin filaments , we treated cells with latrunculin B ( LatB ) , an actin monomer – sequestering drug that re - sults in the disassembly of the actin network . LatB treatment during the process of cell spreading prevented protrusion formation in both EGFP control and Nwk 1 - 428 - expressing cells , whereas the F - actin marker Lifeact - mCherry ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) was redistributed to the cytoplasm as expected ( Figure 6E ) . However , we observed small Nwk - EGFP – decorated buds ( Figure 6E ) at the cell surface , similar to those observed at the initiation of spreading and protru - sion formation in untreated cells ( Figure 1C , arrowheads ) . This sug - gests that F - actin is required for the growth of Nwk F - BAR – induced buds into long protrusions . Thus , despite the difference in size , the morphological similarity of Nwk - induced membrane scallops in vitro and in cells supports a model in which small membrane deformations induced by Nwk in vivo are enhanced by the cytoskeletal machinery into more pro - nounced deformations than those found in vitro ( Figure 7 ) . Together , these data show that Nwk does not induce smooth membrane tubules of either positive or negative curvature , but instead gener - ates periodic membrane ridges and scallops , which have not been previously described for any other BAR protein . We hypothesize that these scallops are produced by membrane buckling between Nwk - induced ridges , and are amplified into longer protrusions in cells by cytoskeletal polymerization . DISCUSSION BAR domain proteins have previously been shown to bind to and deform cellular membranes by diverse mechanisms , including both FIGURE 7 : Model of Nwk activity . Membrane ridges produced by Nwk ( pink ) produce interridge scallops on liposomes that resolve into heterogeneous deformations on giant unilamellar vesicles . On the plasma membrane , the interridge regions are amplified by cytoskeletal forces to produce protrusions , which may be decorated with secondary ridges and their resultant protrusions . Volume 24 August 1 , 2013 Novel mode of membrane remodeling by Nwk | 2415 inhibited activity in cells ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , we find that the conventional charged F - BAR – membrane interaction sur - face is important for the inverse membrane - deforming activity of Nwk in cells . Further , mammalian syndapin I , which also features an S - shaped F - BAR domain ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) , requires charged resi - dues on the concave surface to generate membrane microspikes when overexpressed in cells , in addition to membrane invagina - tions ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Shimada et al . , 2010 ) . This may suggest that IF - BAR activity can arise by distinct mechanisms that utilize opposite membrane - binding surfaces . Alternatively , both the concave and convex surfaces of the F - BAR domain may be required for membrane binding and higher - order assembly . Consistent with this model , our alignments indicate that positive charge remained on the predicted concave surface in the mutant SRGAP3 at an adja - cent lysine ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) , suggesting that electrostatic binding to the membrane via the concave surface might still have been possible , implicating both surfaces in membrane interaction . Thus multiple F - BAR proteins might be adapted to form ridges , scallops , and negative curvature using a conventional concave membrane - binding surface . It will be interesting to test whether other S - shaped BAR domains , such as those of Synd and FCHo2 , assemble into the higher - order zigzags we observe for Nwk and whether the IF - BAR activity of SRGAPs results from an S - shaped structure , to determine how dimer shape plays a role in the geom - etry of higher - order protein assembly and membrane deformation . Membrane deformation by Nwk in synapses Our experiments at the plasma membrane of an S2 cell model and in vitro uncovered a novel membrane - deforming activity for the Nwk F - BAR domain . Similar experiments in cell culture and in vitro have been instrumental to uncovering the membrane - deforming activities of other BAR domain proteins and reflect the activities of these proteins in their normal physiological contexts ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Guerrier et al . , 2009 ) . However , it remains unknown which specific membranes the Nwk membrane - ridging and - scalloping activity targets in the physiological context of the animal . Drosophila Nwk is a neuronally expressed protein that binds to and cooperates with dynamin and Dap160 to constrain synaptic growth ( O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ; Rodal et al . , 2008 ) . We previ - ously used genetic evidence and live imaging in neurons to show that Nwk - positive endosomal compartments transiently interact with Sorting nexin 16 ( SNX16 ) – positive endosomes , resulting in re - cycling of signaling receptors to the plasma membrane . In addition , dynamin - dependent scission is required for the separation of these Nwk - and Snx16 - positive compartments , presumably after cargo transfer ( Rodal et al . , 2011 ) . One model that brings together these findings is that the physio - logical function of membrane ridging and scalloping by Nwk is to cooperate with dynamin - dependent membrane scission during cargo transfer between endosomal compartments . Helical dynamin scaf - folds assemble and constrict around highly curved membrane tubules in vitro , resulting in destabilization of the lipid bilayer ( Pucadyil , 2011 ) . Fission occurs at the interface between dynamin - bound and unbound membrane and is enhanced by differences in curvature at the bound - ary ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . Stabilization of membrane curvature at the boundary by Nwk , together with recruitment of dynamin to Nwk ridges via physical interactions between the first SH3 domain of Nwk and dynamin , could enhance or regulate scission activity . Our findings define a novel membrane - deforming activity that may extend to many members of the F - BAR domain family , and provide a new view for how diverse membrane structures are regu - lated in vivo . efficient membrane binding and for tubulation in cells ( Figure 4 ) suggests that these sequences may mediate protein – protein inter - actions within zigzags . The assembly of zigzag shapes and the importance of concave face - to - membrane interactions would be predicted to generate membrane ridges ( Figure 5G ) , consistent with the vertices of mem - brane scallops found by cryo - EM on Nwk - decorated liposomes . Importantly , cryo - EM images reflect a summation of electron scat - tering information along the beam path , and thus produce projec - tion images with some three - dimensional information . Therefore , flat membrane regions , ridges , or tufts must extend straight and for some length in the Z direction in order to be visible in the pro - jection image . This suggests that the 3D structure of these scal - loped liposomes forms a disk with perpendicular ridges along its edges , although we cannot exclude the presence of short or curved ridges on some liposomes , since they would not be revealed by cryo - EM . Our results support a model in which Nwk - generated mem - brane ridges lead to membrane scallops in interridge regions , both on liposomes and in cells ( Figure 7 ) . The similar distance between protein tufts , the ends of flat membrane surfaces , and scallop api - ces on liposomes ( ∼ 70 nm ; Supplemental Figure S5 ) is consistent with a progression of membrane deformations beginning with Nwk F - BAR ridge formation and culminating in membrane scalloping . We propose that in vitro , extensive membrane scalloping gener - ates global changes in membrane shape , characterized by mem - brane flattening of GUVs , whereas in cells , donut - shaped ridges induce membrane buds on the cell surface that are deformed into long protrusions through the action of cytoskeletal forces ( Figure 7 ) . Consistent with this model , Nwk 1 - 428 - expressing cells remain deco - rated with small membrane buds when actin polymerization is blocked ( Figure 6E ) . In vivo , Nwk interacts with the actin nucleation – promoting factor WASp and endocytic proteins to couple the actin cytoskeleton to endosomal traffic ( Rodal et al . , 2008 ) . WASp binding is mediated by the first SH3 domain of Nwk , which is not present in the protrusion - generating Nwk 1 - 428 fragment . Therefore , the F - BAR domain alone , or the membrane deformation it induces , is sufficient to promote cytoskeletal elaboration of small cellular buds into long protrusions . In cells , C - terminal sequences including the SH3 domains may local - ize and activate F - BAR domain activity at specific cellular locations . Thus , interactions with both the actin and endocytic machineries , via the SH3 domains of Nwk , likely provide additional regulatory mech - anisms in vivo . Our results describing a novel higher - order assembly for F - BAR dimers also shed new light on the question of whether BAR do - mains generate or merely sense membrane curvature . At minimum , an expanded repertoire of higher - order BAR domain organization argues that these proteins sense complex geometry as well as local curvature , but is perhaps even more consistent with the active gen - eration of tailored membrane topography by distinct BAR family members . Potential for membrane scalloping by other members of the F - BAR family An IF - BAR activity has previously been observed in SRGAP proteins , which are phylogenetically closely related to Nwk . SRGAPs are present in vertebrates and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2010 ) but appear to have been lost in arthropods , including Drosophila . Mutations in charged residues in the pre - dicted concave surface of SRGAP3 had no effect on membrane deformation , whereas mutations on the predicted convex surface 2416 | A . N . Becalska et al .

Protein expression and purification cDNAs ( all isoforms from www . flybase . org ) encoding Drosophila Nwk - PB ( amino acids 1 – 428 ) and Drosophila Mim - PB ( amino acids 1 – 265 ) were cloned into a pET28a ( EMD Millipore ) derivative modi - fied with a PreScission Protease cleavage site ( GE Healthcare , Pis - cataway , NJ ; Schwartz et al . , 2004 ) . cDNAs encoding Drosophila Cip4 - PA ( amino acids 1 – 312 ) and Drosophila Syndapin - PA ( amino acids 1 – 300 ) were cloned into pTrcHisA ( Invitrogen ) . Hexahistidine ( 6xHis ) - tagged proteins were purified from BL21 DE3 E . coli extracts using an IMAC affinity column followed by anion exchange on a Resource Q column and gel filtration on a Superose 12 column ( GE Healthcare ) , essentially as described for other Nwk fragments ( Rodal et al . , 2008 ) . For expression and purification of O 6 - alkylguanine - DNA alkyltransferase ( SNAP ) - tagged proteins ( Keppler et al . , 2003 ) , the SNAP tag ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) was inserted be - tween the 6xHis tags and the F - BAR domain . Proteins were purified from E . coli extracts on nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads ( Qiagen ) , washed with PBS with 30 mM imidazole , and then incu - bated overnight with a threefold molar excess of SNAP - 549 ( New England Biolabs ) and 0 . 5 mM DTT . Beads were then washed with 10 volumes of PBS with 30 mM imidazole , and proteins were eluted with 50 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM KCl , and 250 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 , gel filtered on a Superose 12 column ( GE Healthcare ) into 20 mM Tris , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 0 . 5 mM DTT , pH 7 . 5 , and flash frozen in liquid N 2 . For urea denaturation assays , proteins were diluted to 0 . 5 μM in 20 mM Tris and 50 mM KCl , pH 7 . 5 , and the indicated concentration of urea and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . Intrinsic fluores - cence ( excitation , 280 nm , emission , 340 nm ) was measured in a fluorometer ( PTI , Birmingham , NJ ) . Background fluorescence of urea buffer alone was subtracted , values were normalized to maxi - mum intrinsic fluorescence for each protein , and denaturation curves were plotted using Prism software . Liposome and GUV assays Lipids ( dioleolylphosphatidylcholine [ DOPC ] , palmitoyl - oleolyl - phosphatidylethanolamine [ POPE ] , dioleolyl - phosphatidylserine [ DOPS ] , brain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and NBD - POPE ) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) , with the exception of synthetic phos - phoinositides in Figure 2B , which were obtained from Echelon Bio - sciences ( Salt Lake City , UT ) . Lipids were mixed in the indicated ra - tios and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas , followed by 1 h under vacuum . Lipid films were then hydrated in 20 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) , pH 7 . 5 , and 100 mM NaCl for 2 h at 37ºC to a final concentration of 1 . 5 mg / ml , vortexed , and freeze - thawed five times using liquid nitrogen . For cosedimentation at varied salt concentrations , lipids were hydrated in 200 mM , 1 . 1 M , and 2 . 3 M NaCl for 100 , 400 , and 800 mM final concentration , respectively . Liposomes were then extruded ( where indicated ) 11 times through 50 - to 400 - nm filters and used within 24 h . For li - posome cosedimentation assays ( all done in triplicate ) , 10 μl of 1 . 5 mg / ml liposomes was incubated with 20 μl of 0 . 15 mg / ml pro - tein for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 18 , 000 × g for 20 min at 4°C . Proteins were prespun under the same conditions before incubation with lipids . Pellets and supernatants were separated and equal amounts fractionated by SDS – PAGE , stained with Coomassie , and quantified by densitometry on a LICOR Odys - sey instrument . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture S2 cells ( Cherbas and Cherbas , 1998 ) were cultured according to standard protocols in Schneider’s media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 0 . 1 mg / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Pen - Strep ) . Transfections were performed using Effectene reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) and incubated for 2 d at 25°C . EGFP - and mCherry - tagged nwk , cip4 , synd , mim , and Lifeact ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) constructs were generated by Gateway technology ( Invitro - gen , Grand Island , NY ) using pBI - UASc – derived destination vectors ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Constructs were cotransfected with actin pro - moter - Gal4 . For fixed - cell imaging , cells were spread for 1 h on coverslips coated with concanavalin A ( ConA ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , fixed for 10 min in 4 % formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , washed three times with PBS , and mounted in Vectashield ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA ) . For phalloi - din staining , cells were fixed as described , washed three times in PBST ( PBS / 0 . 2 % Tween ) , blocked for 30 min in PBST / 1 % bovine se - rum albumin ( BSA ) / 2 % normal goat serum ( NGS ) , incubated for 1 h with rhodamine phalloidin ( 1 : 1000 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) in PBST / 1 % BSA / 2 % NGS , washed three times in PBST , and mounted as described . For live imaging , cells were spread on ConA - coated eight - chamber slides ( Lab - Tek ; Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) . To disrupt the actin cytoskeleton , latrunculin B ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) diluted in Schneider’s / FBS / Pen - Strep was added at a final concentration of 125 μM . For cell fractionation , cells were transfected in 60 - mm dishes as described , incubated for 2 d , and then transferred to 15 - ml conical tubes . Cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min , washed in PBS , resuspended in cold 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , and 1 mM di - thiothreitol ( DTT ) supplemented with protease inhibitors ( P2714 [ Sigma - Aldrich ] with 0 . 5 μg / ml pepstatin ) , and incubated 20 min on ice . Samples were lysed by three rounds of freeze – thaw in liquid ni - trogen and spun sequentially at 4ºC at 1000 × g for 10 min , 15 , 000 × g for 30 min , and 100 , 000 × g for 1 h . Supernatants and pellets were fractionated by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted using rabbit anti - GFP ( MBL598 , 1 : 1000 ; MBL International , Woburn , MA ) and an Odyssey infrared detection system ( LICOR , Lincoln , NE ) . HEK293T cells were cultured on laminin - coated coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 0 . 1 mg / ml Pen - Strep and transfected with polyethylenimine according to standard protocols . After 24 h , transfected cells were fixed for 20 min in 4 % formalde - hyde , stained with rhodamine – phalloidin , and mounted in Mowiol ( Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) . Image and statistical analyses All confocal imaging was conducted on a Marianas spinning disk confocal system ( 3I , Denver , CO ) consisting of a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a Yokagawa CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal head ( Yokogawa , Tokyo , Japan ) and a QuantEM 512SC EMCCD camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . Fluorescence microscopy image analysis was performed in ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . For S2 cell protrusion quantification , perimeter and area were calculated from single slices at the coverslip surface from confocal stacks of at least 18 cells per sample . Electron microscopy image analysis was performed using IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) and IMAGIC ( van Heel et al . , 1996 ) soft - ware . Length of membrane deformations was defined by the length of the line segment joining the endpoints of the deformation . All errors shown are mean ± SEM . Statistical significance was calculated with Prism software ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) using analysis of Volume 24 August 1 , 2013 Novel mode of membrane remodeling by Nwk | 2417 with 1 % uranyl acetate and imaged on a Tecnai G12 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operating at 120 kV voltage . A total of 910 Cip4 dimer particles , 680 Nwk dimer particles ( treating the arms of V - shaped oligomers as separate particles ) , and 350 complete Nwk V - shaped oligomer particles were manually selected from the EM images of Cip4 or Nwk bound to the lipid monolayer , using EMAN2 software ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . To process the selected im - ages , classification procedures were implemented in IMAGIC ( van Heel et al . , 1996 ) . All images were centered , using the center of mass of all particles as a reference , and aligned . To interpret the exact orientation of each “arm , ” we used projection matching . A set of 20 reference projections was generated from the predicted Nwk Phyre structure ( filtered to 20 Å ) by rotating the Nwk dimer along its long axis by 10° . The experimental projection images of each arm of the V structures were then cross - correlated with each of the refer - ence projections of the predicted structure using the IMAGIC com - mand align - dir , resulting in correlation coefficients of 0 . 6 – 0 . 75 . The arm was designated as being in the same orientation as the best matching reference , that is , the reference with which the highest cross - correlation coefficient was obtained . Correlative light and electron microscopy S2 cells were transfected as described and spread for 1 h on ConA - coated , marked Aclar disks . These disks ( 1 . 5 mm in diameter ) were punched out of Aclar film ( 50426 - 10 ; EMS , Fort Washington , PA ) and marked with a finder - grid pattern to permit tracking specific cells of interest throughout light microscopy and EM sample prepa - ration . After locating the transfected cells on the disks using an Evos FL epifluorescence microscope ( Advanced Microscopy Group , Bothell , WA ) and a Marianas spinning disk confocal microscope , we transferred the Aclar disks with cells into aluminum platelets for high - pressure freezing ( Wohlwend , Zurich , Switzerland ) . Disks were covered with 150 mM sucrose in medium as cryoprotectant before closing the high - pressure freezing hat with another platelet , creat - ing a cavity 0 . 1 mm in height . The samples were rapidly frozen us - ing a Leica HPM - 100 high - pressure freezer ( Leica Microsystems , Vienna , Austria ) . Essentially following previously published methods ( Jimenez et al . , 2006 ; McDonald et al . , 2007 ; Buser and Walther , 2008 ) , we freeze - substituted frozen samples at low temperature in a solution containing 1 % osmium tetroxide ( EMS ) , 0 . 5 % anhydrous glutaraldehyde ( EMS ) , and 2 % water in anhydrous acetone ( AC32680 - 0010 ; Fisher Scientific , Hampton , NH ) using a Leica AFS - 2 device . The temperature was kept at − 90°C for 3 d and then raised to 4°C over the course of 18 h . Samples were washed with anhydrous acetone , infiltrated with diluted embedding medium , and embedded in EMbed 812 - Resin ( EMS ) at room temperature . For TEM analysis , guided by the pattern on the Aclar disk , the resin block was trimmed to the quadrant containing the cells of interest . Ultrathin sections ( 70 nm ) were cut with a diamond knife ( Diatome , Biel , Switzerland ) and collected on slot grids covered with Formvar support film . After poststaining with uranyl acetate ( 2 % ) and Reyn - old’s lead citrate ( saturated ) , sections were inspected on a Mor - gagni transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operating at 80 kV or a Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operating at 300 kV and equipped with a 4k × 4k CCD camera ( Gatan ) . Large - area overview images of entire cells of interest were recorded at sufficiently high magnification for ultrastructural investigation ( 23 , 000 × magnification ) using the montaging function of the micro - scope control software SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) to acquire overlapping image tiles and the image reconstruction software IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) to assemble the tiles into a large - area EM image . GUVs were generated by electroswelling lipid mixtures on in - dium titanium oxide ( ITO ) – coated slides in a Vesicle Prep Pro device ( Nanion Technologies , Munich , Germany ) . Briefly , 5 μl of 10 mg / ml lipids ( molar ratio 55 % DOPC , 20 % POPE , 14 . 5 % DOPS , 10 % brain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 0 . 5 % NBD - POPE ) dissolved in 19 : 1 chloroform : methanol was dried on ITO slides under vacuum , then swelled in 280 μl of 5 mM HEPES and 300 mM sucrose , pH 7 . 5 , for 2 h at 37ºC using a 3 - V sinusoidal current at 8 Hz . Five microliters of GUVs was diluted into 5 mM HEPES and 150 mM KCl , pH 7 . 5 , incubated with the in - dicated concentrations of SNAP - tagged F - BAR proteins , and im - aged using a 100 × / numerical aperture 1 . 4 objective in multiwell slides ( Lab - Tek ) precoated with 1 mg / ml BSA . Protein alignment and homology modeling Protein sequences were obtained from the National Center for Bio - technology Information , using the following accession numbers : Drosophila melanogaster ( Dm ) Nwk , AFH04360 . 1 ; Mus musculus ( Mm ) FCHSD2 , NP _ 001139482 . 1 ; M . musculus ( Mm ) FCHSD1 , Q6PFY1 . 1 ; Ciona intestinalis ( Ci ) Nwk , XP _ 002128227 . 1 ; Homo sapi - ens ( Hs ) Wrp / SrGAP3 , Q812A2 . 1 ; and H . sapiens ( Hs ) FBP17 , NP _ 055848 . 1 . Alignments were generated using CLUSTALX ( Larkin et al . , 2007 ) . A homology model of the Nwk structure was built using protein homology / analogy recognition engine ( Phyre ) version 2 . 0 ( www . sbg . bio . ic . ac . uk / phyre / ) . Secondary structure predictions were generated with Promal3D ( http : / / prodata . swmed . edu / promals3d / promals3d . php ) . Structural depictions were created using MacPyMol 2 . 0 ( www . pymol . org ) and Chimera ( www . cgl . ucsf . edu / chimera / ) . Electron microscopy Liposomes for negative staining and cryo – electron microscopy were generated at 1 mg / ml as described from Folch fraction I ( Sigma - Al - drich ) supplemented with 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and extruded through a 400 - nm filter ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . Liposomes ( 0 . 75 mg / ml ) were in - cubated with Nwk 1 - 428 ( 0 . 4 μM ) or Cip4 1 - 312 ( 0 . 9 μM ) for 30 min . For negative staining the samples were applied to copper grids coated with continuous carbon , negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate ( JT Baker Chemical Co . , Phillipsburg , NJ ) , and imaged using an FEI Morgagni transmission electron microscope ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR ) op - erating at 80 kV and equipped with a 1k × 1k charge coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( Gatan , Pleasanton , CA ) . For cryo – electron microscopy , Quantifoil R2 / 2 Copper 400 mesh grids ( Quantifoil MicroTools , Jena , Germany ) were cleaned by im - mersion in a small amount of ethyl acetate in a glass Petri dish over - night . Samples were applied to freshly glow - discharged grids ( 45 s / 20 mA ) and plunge - frozen in liquid ethane using a FEI Vitrobot or Gatan CP3 plunge - freezer . Cryospecimens were loaded into a Gatan cryoholder and imaged under low - dose conditions using a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operating at 200 kV and equipped with an Eagle 4k × 4k CCD camera ( FEI ) . Im - ages were recorded at a nominal magnification of 25 , 000 × , resulting in a pixel size of 4 . 5 Å , and with a defocus of − 3 to − 6 μm . For single - particle electron microscopy of higher assemblies of the F - BAR domains of Cip4 and Nwk on lipid monolayers , 1 μl of 1 mg / ml lipids ( molar ratio 65 % DOPC , 14 . 5 % POPE , 10 % DOPS , 10 % brain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 0 . 5 % rhodamine PE , dissolved in 20 : 9 : 1 chloroform : methanol : water ) on a 25 - μl drop of buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl ) was incubated in a Teflon well in a humid chamber at 4ºC for 1 h , essentially as previously described ( Taylor et al . , 2007 ) . Lipid monolayers were then lifted onto carbon - coated copper EM grids ( 400 mesh ; Ted Pella , Redding , CA ) , and the buffer was replaced with a solution containing 1 μM Cip4 1 - 312 or 1 . 4 μM Nwk 1 - 428 for 2 min .
