Here , using a cell - free system , we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis . Unexpectedly , we also find that amphiphysin - 1 , like dynamin - 1 , can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules . Moreover , amphiphysin - 1 assembles with dynamin - 1 into ring - like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome - fragmenting activity of dynamin - 1 in the presence of GTP . These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers , indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding , and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis . mphiphysin is the collective name given to two very similar proteins , amphiphysins 1 and 2 , which may be involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , actin function and signalling pathways 1 – 9 . Isoforms of amphiphysin - 1 and - 2 form homodimers and heterodimers and are highly concentrated in the nerve termi - nal , where they have a putative role in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles . Amphiphysin is composed of three main domains . The amino - terminal domain , which contains regions predicted to form coiled - coils , is involved in dimerization 3 . The central region binds , through distinct sites , the heavy chain of clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein AP - 2 ( refs 3 , 10 – 12 ) . The carboxy - terminal region comprises an Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) domain which binds the GTPase dynamin and the inositol - 5 ¢ - phosphatase synaptojanin - 1 ( refs 2 , 13 – 16 ) . The interactions of both the SH3 domain and the central region are regulated by phosphorylation of amphiphysin and / or its binding partners 3 . Experimental manipulations of living cells that disrupt the interactions of amphiphysin with either dynamin or clathrin and AP - 2 markedly inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis 3 , 17 , 18 . These findings indicate that amphiphysin may act as a regulated linker protein that couples clathrin - mediated bud - ding of endocytotic vesicles to dynamin - mediated vesicle fission . Our goal in this study was to provide a direct demonstration of this hypothesis , using purified components in a cell - free system . Protein - free liposomes composed of brain lipid extracts or syn - thetic lipid mixtures are fully competent to support the formation of several coated structures that have been implicated in vesicular membrane traffic , including clathrin - coated buds and dynamin - coated tubules 19 – 21 . In these cell - free systems , addition of GTP to dynamin - coated tubules produces tubule fragmentation and vesiculation 19 , 21 . As dynamin alone can tubulate liposomes , and clathrin coats alone can generate vesicular buds 19 , we tested whether amphiphysin can mediate a coupling between these two processes . Our results not only confirm this hypothesis , but also demonstrate unexpected effects of amphiphysin on lipid curvature and on the liposome - fragmenting activity of dynamin . Results Amphiphysin - 1 links clathrin coats and dynamin . Purified dynamin - 1 can evaginate protein - free liposomes into narrow dynamin - coated tubules 19 , 21 . Likewise , a clathrin - coat fraction obtained by stripping bovine clathrin - coated vesicles can induce the formation of clathrin - coated buds on liposomes 19 . We incubated liposomes composed of a brain lipid extract with recombinant dynamin - 1 and the coat fraction together . Negative staining of these preparations revealed both clathrin - coated buds and dynamin - coated tubules ( Fig . 1a ) . The two types of structure , however , were largely independent of each other . A morphometric analysis revealed that only 24 % of the dynamin - coated tubules were capped by a clathrin - coated bud ( Fig . 1d , left bar ) . Addition of puri - fied recombinant amphiphysin - 1 to the lipid – protein mixture increased this association ( Fig . 1b ) . Under these conditions , 72 % of the dynamin tubules were capped with clathrin - coated buds ( Fig . 1d , centre bar ) . This observation provides morphological evidence for the hypothesis that one of the functions of amphiphysin is to act as a linker between dynamin and the clathrin coat . Amphiphysin - 1 alone tubulates liposomes . In control experi - ments , we incubated liposomes with both amphiphysin - 1 and the coat fraction in the absence of dynamin - 1 . To our surprise , we observed a massive tubulation of liposomes even under these con - ditions ( Fig . 1c ) . Tubules were similar in diameter to those gener - ated in the presence of dynamin - 1 ( compare Fig . 1a – c ) and in about 95 % of the cases the ends of the tubules were capped by clathrin - coated buds ( Fig . 1d , right column ) . As liposomes incubated with the coat fraction alone formed only clathrin - coated buds but not tubules 19 , we tested the effect of amphiphysin - 1 alone on the morphology of liposomes . Incuba - tion of liposomes with amphiphysin - 1 resulted in a tubulation of liposomes ( Fig . 2b ) that was even more massive than that pro - duced by dynamin - 1 at the same concentration . These results indicate that amphiphysin - 1 , like dynamin - 1 , has the ability to bind lipid bilayers and to evaginate them into high - curvature membranes . In addition to liposomes composed of the brain lipid extract , we tested liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in several relative ratios . Tubulation by amphiphysin - 1 increased in parallel with the ratio of phosphati - dylserine to phosphatidylcholine , showing a preference of amphiphysin - 1 for acidic phospholipids ( data not shown ) . We used another lipid - binding protein , AP180 ( ref . 22 ) , as a control . AP180 , a component of brain clathrin - coated vesicles with a puta - tive role in controlling synaptic vesicle size 22 , 23 , did not tubulate liposomes ( data not shown ) , thus indicating that the effect of A © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles 34 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY | VOL 1 | MAY 1999 | cellbio . nature . com amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 on the morphology of liposomes is specific . To define the region of amphiphysin - 1 that is required for lipid tubulation , we generated several fusion proteins containing differ - ent amphiphysin - 1 fragments and glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) 24 ( Fig . 2a ) . Pilot experiments showed that GST did not alter Figure 1 Effect of amphiphysin - 1 on the coupling between clathrin - coated budding and dynamin - mediated tubulation in protein - free liposomes composed of a brain lipid extract . a – c , Negatively stained liposomes after incubation with the clathrin - coat fraction plus the following recombinant proteins : a , dynamin - 1 ; b , dynamin - 1 plus amphiphysin - 1 ; c , amphiphysin - 1 .

We therefore used fragments of amphiphysin - 1 fused to GST without cleaving off the GST . A fusion protein comprising amino acids 1 – 286 of amphiphysin - 1 fully retained the tubulating activity of the full - length protein ( Fig . 2c ) , whereas a further deletion at the C - termi - nal side of this fragment markedly decreased the tubulating activity . We therefore assign the lipid - tubulating activity of amphiphysin - 1 to the N - terminal region , which is the portion of the molecule that is most conserved in evolution from yeast to humans . A hybrid coat consisting of amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 . High - power observation of negatively stained amphiphysin - 1 - coated tubules revealed a decoration by closely apposed rings ( Fig . 3a ) . These rings were thinner and more tightly packed than those seen on dynamin - 1 - generated tubules produced from the same lipo - somes in either the absence ( Fig . 3c ) or the presence ( data not shown ) of the non - hydrolysable GTP analogue GTP - g S . In thin sec - tions of conventionally processed material , the coats comprising amphiphysin - 1 alone or dynamin - 1 alone were hardly detectable ( Fig . 3b , d ) . Thus , they were different from the thick , electron - dense , regularly spaced rings that are typically seen on tubules gen - erated by incubation of liposomes or synaptic membranes with brain cytosol plus ATP and GTP - g S ( Fig . 3g , h ) 19 , 25 . These observa - tions indicate that the rings generated in the presence of brain cytosol and GTP - g S may comprise other proteins in addition to dynamin . We next studied the effect of recombinant amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 together on liposome morphology . A mixture of the two proteins , with or without GTP - g S , generated tubules whose coats were noticeably different from those generated by either one of the two proteins alone ( Fig . 3e , f ; see also below ) . Furthermore , whereas dynamin - 1 alone decorated both the low - curvature and the tubular regions of liposomes ( Fig . 3a ) , the presence of amphiphysin - 1 appeared to segregate dynamin - 1 to the liposomes’ tubular portions ( Fig . 3l ) . As seen by either neg - ative or positive staining of plastic - embedded material , the coat produced by amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 together consisted of thick rings and was similar to that generated by brain cytosol in the presence of ATP and GTP - g S ( Fig . 3g , h ) . A GST - fusion protein containing the amphiphysin SH3 domain , which did not tubulate liposomes , failed to generate this modified form of coats when incubated with liposomes and dynamin . Likewise , the amphiphysin - 1 fragment comprising amino acids 1 – 286 , which tubulates liposomes but lacks the SH3 domain , did not modify the dynamin coat . In the presence of this fragment , which does not bind dynamin , only amphiphysin - like or dynamin - like coats were generated , as if the two proteins segre - gated themselves into homogeneous coats ( data not shown ) . Figure 3 Amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 co - assemble into a hybrid coat . a – h , The tubular coat generated by a mixture of amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 ( e , f ) differs from those generated by either amphiphysin - 1 ( a , b ) or dynamin - 1 ( c , d ) alone . The hybrid coat resembles the coat generated from total brain cytosol on either liposomes ( h ) or synaptic membranes ( g ) . a , c , e , Negative staining of liposomes ; b , d , f – h , positive staining of liposomes or synaptic membranes that have been embedded in plastic and thin - sectioned . The amphiphysin - 1 and the dynamin - 1 coats are represented by tightly packed rings that are not easily visualized by conventional positive staining microscopy ( b , d ) . Coats generated by amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 together or by total brain cytosol plus ATP and GTP - g S appear as thicker , less densely packed rings , which are electron - dense in conventional microscopy ( f – h ) . i – l , Immunocytochemical demonstration that intense immunoreactivity for both amphiphysin - 1 ( i – k ) and dynamin - 1 ( l ) is present along the coated tubules generated by incubation of liposomes with amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 .

Immunogold labelling of the coat generated by the dynamin – amphiphysin mixture revealed intense immunoreactivity towards both proteins along the entire tubule ( Fig . 3i – l ) . This observation indicates that the thick , electron - dense ring generated under these conditions results from an interaction of the two proteins . After the same labelling protocol , tubules generated by cytosol , ATP and GTP - g S on synaptic membranes 26 were equally immunoreactive for dynamin - 1 , but much less intensely immunoreactive for amphiphysin - 1 19 , 26 . It will be interesting to determine whether this discrepancy reflects masking of amphiphysin - 1 epitopes by other cytosolic proteins or co - existence of amphiphysin - 1 with other cytosolic SH3 - domain - containing proteins , such as amphiphysin - 2 , in the dynamin coat . Amphiphysin – dynamin rings in solution . One possible explana - tion for the morphology of the amphiphysin – dynamin hybrid coat is an intrinsic property of these two proteins to co - assemble into rings . To test this hypothesis , we studied the effect of amphiphysin - 1 on the oligomerization of dynamin - 1 in membrane - free solu - tions . Dynamin - 1 has been shown previously to oligomerize into open rings spontaneously when incubated in buffers of low ionic strength 27 . Amphiphysin - 1 alone never formed rings under several conditions tested ( Fig . 4b and data not shown ) . Under conditions of physiological ionic strength , in which dynamin - 1 alone formed only a very few rings ( Fig . 4a ) , massive ring formation was pro - duced by a mixture of amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 ( Fig . 4c ) . These rings were similar in thickness and size to those formed by the amphiphysin - 1 – dynamin - 1 mixture on lipid tubules . Together , these results indicate that amphiphysin - 1 can co - assemble with dynamin - 1 into ring - like structures and can cooperate with dynamin - 1 in the formation of tubular coats . Amphiphysin enhances dynamin’s liposome - fragmenting activity . Addition of GTP to dynamin - 1 - coated lipid tubules results in their fragmentation , as shown by both negative - stain - ing and light - scattering experiments 19 , 21 . This effect has been attributed to a conformational change in the dynamin ring that correlates with GTP hydrolysis . Addition of GTP , but not GTP - g S , to amphiphysin – dynamin - coated tubules had a similar effect , as shown by negative staining in Fig . 5 . To test whether the presence of amphiphysin - 1 affects the liposome - fragmenting activity of dynamin - 1 in the presence of GTP , we performed light - scattering experiments . Addition of dynamin - 1 to lipo - somes resulted in a steep increase in light scattering , reflecting the formation of tubules ( Fig . 5d ) . GTP produced an immediate drop in light scattering ( see also ref . 21 ) that persisted with time , indicating a new steady state .

Conversely , when amphiphysin - 1 was added to dynamin - coated tubules in the absence of nucleotides , a small increase , rather than a decrease , in light scattering was observed , possibly reflecting enhanced tubulation . Addition of GTP to this mixture produced a drop in light scattering to the same values as those observed when amphiphysin - 1 was added to the dynamin plus GTP mixture ( Fig . 5e ) . Finally , tubules generated by amphiphysin - 1 alone were resistant to GTP , but underwent rapid vesiculation when dynamin - 1 was added to the mixture . All of the samples tested by light scattering were also analysed by negative staining . This morphological analysis confirmed that the potentiation of the GTP - dependent drop in light scattering produced by amphiphysin - 1 resulted from enhanced liposome fragmentation ( data not shown ) . At least a few short tubules , however , were seen in all conditions . There may be several explanations for the enhancement by amphiphysin - 1 of the liposome - fragmenting activity of dynamin - 1 . Amphiphysin - 1 may potentiate the recruitment of dynamin - 1 to liposomes . The results of sedimentation experiments , however , showed that , at least under our experimental conditions and with the ratio of reagents used , the amount of dynamin - 1 recruited to liposomes was not affected by amphiphysin - 1 ( Fig . 6a ) . Another possibility is that amphiphysin - 1 stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin - 1 . However , when tested in solution amphiphysin pro - duced only a very modest increase in dynamin’s GTPase activity . Liposomes , in agreement with previous findings , had a powerful stimulatory effect on the activity , but amphiphysin - 1 did not fur - ther stimulate this effect ( Fig . 6b ) . Further possibilities are dis - cussed below . Discussion In this study we have attempted to elucidate the physiological functions of some of the interactions that take place during synap - tic - vesicle endocytosis by using a cell - free system and defined com - ponents . The process of clathrin - mediated endocytosis can be dissected into several major steps , which include recruitment of the clathrin coat , invagination of the coated membrane patch and fission of the coated bud in a process that requires dynamin 28 . A function of amphiphysin as a bridge between the AP - 2 / clathrin coat and dynamin - 1 had been inferred from its biochemical properties 2 , 3 , 10 , 11 , 17 . In agreement with this prediction , we have shown here that a structural continuity between clathrin - coated and dynamin - coated membrane areas is enhanced by the presence of recombinant amphiphysin - 1 . Unexpectedly , these studies have also led us to discover new properties of amphiphysin - 1 . First , amphiphysin - 1 binds lipid membranes . Second , amphiphysin - 1 , like dynamin - 1 , has a powerful ability to transform spherical lipo - somes into narrow tubules . Third , amphiphysin - 1 co - assembles with dynamin and affects its function . Thus , amphiphysin may have multiple functions in the endocytotic reaction ( Fig . 7 ) . The liposome - binding properties of amphiphysin - 1 indicate that it may act as a multifunctional linker protein that anchors the clathrin coat , dynamin and the lipid bilayer to each other . Given its ability to bind both clathrin and the membrane , it may act as an accessory clathrin adaptor . A similar function has been pro - posed for arrestin 29 . It remains to be determined whether amphiphysin also assists dynamin in clathrin - independent endo - cytotic reactions 30 , 31 . Lipid tubulation by a protein reflects the ability of that protein to bind to , and to oligomerize at , the surface of a lipid bilayer .

Figure 7 Interactions of the amphiphysin dimer at a clathrin - coated endocytotic pit . Amphiphysin dimerizes through its N - terminal region which also binds the lipid bilayer . It binds the heavy chain of clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 through its central region and binds dynamin through its C - terminal SH3 domain . As shown by our results , amphiphysin enhances membrane curvature and potentiates the liposome - fragmenting activity of dynamin in the presence of GTP .

In most cases reported , the protein and the lipid surface exhibit opposite charges and the proc - ess is presumably driven by electrostatic interactions . In contrast , amphiphysin - 1 , which is negatively charged , tubulates liposomes of the same charge , arguing against the involvement of nonspecific electrostatic effects . Moreover , the tubulation mediated by amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 takes place at a far higher rate and efficiency than tubulation mediated by the other proteins studied 32 , 33 . The generation of high - curvature membrane tubules by amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 is of special interest because the evagination of endocytotic buds requires deformation of the bilayer into high - curvature domains , at which amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 have been detected immunocytochemically . The mem - brane - tubulating activity of amphiphysin - 1 resides in its N - termi - nal region . It has been mapped to a fragment ( defined as domain A in ref . 24 ) that is the only one common to all amphiphysin - family members , including the yeast proteins Rvs161 and Rvs167 ( ref . 24 ) . It is therefore plausible that this activity may be shared by all amphiphysin - family members , and that the amphiphysin - 1 – amphiphysin - 2 heterodimer functions in the same way as the amphiphysin - 1 homodimer studied here . The ability of amphiphysin to oligomerize with dynamin changes our view of the dynamin ring . Purified dynamin can spontaneously oligomerize into open rings and stacks of rings 27 , 34 . On the basis of this observation , the rings generated using total brain cytosol , ATP and GTP - g S on membrane templates in vitro 25 , or by mutant dynamin in situ 35 , were thought to represent dynamin alone . We have shown here that these structures are unlikely to consist of only dynamin . We have also shown that amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 together , both in solution and around lipid membranes , are sufficient to generate the thicker , electron - dense rings that are seen on membranes incubated with cytosol , ATP and GTP - g S . We conclude that the structures gener - ated in the presence of cytosol , ATP and GTP - g S are likely to con - tain other proteins in addition to dynamin - 1 , and that amphiphysin - 1 may be one such protein . The liposome - fragmenting activity of dynamin - 1 in our cell - free system was enhanced by addition of amphiphysin - 1 . However , the effect of amphiphysin - 1 could not be explained by either enhanced recruitment of dynamin - 1 to the membrane or stimulation of dynamin - 1’s GTPase activity . The effect of amphiphysin - 1 on dynamin - 1 in this assay may reflect the ability of amphiphysin to reorganize dynamin at the surface of the bilayer . The addition of amphiphysin - 1 appeared to cause a more efficient segregation of dynamin - 1 into the tubular portion of liposomes , which may be seen as equivalent to the neck of an endocytotic bud . Thus amphiphysin may have a physiological role in concentrating dynamin at the vesicle neck as vesicular buds are formed . Amphiphysin may also improve the coupling of dynamin action to membrane fission by other mechanisms . The ability of purified dynamin and amphiphysin to form highly ordered structures that undergo GTP - dependent changes provides a powerful experimen - tal system with which to gain further insights into the structure – function relationship of these two proteins . The precise relationship of the liposome - fragmenting activity of dynamin in vitro to the role of dynamin in endocytosis requires fur - ther clarification . Dynamin - 1 alone can fragment liposomes in vitro in a GTP - dependent manner . However , dynamin - coated tubules may exist even in the presence of GTP , probably reflecting an equi - librium between tubule growth and tubule fragmentation under these conditions ( see also ref . 19 ) . In the living cell , dynamin may be only one component of a more complex machinery that drives the fission of a vesicle from the plasma membrane . As discussed previously 15 , the main function of GTP - bound dynamin may be to recruit and / or activate other proteins at the neck of a vesicle bud . These other proteins may then act as the effectors in the fission reaction . Irrespective of the precise mechanism of action of dynamin in endocytosis , our findings indicate that the functions of amphiphysin and dynamin are closely interconnected and that the effects of amphiphysin rely not only on protein – protein interac - tions but also on a key interaction with membrane lipids . h Methods Reagents . Mouse monoclonal antibodies against amphiphysin - 1 have been described previously 36 . Monoclonal antibodies directed against dynamin ( Hudy - 1 ) were purchased from UBI ( Lake Placid , NY ) . 6 - nm pro - tein - A – gold conjugates were prepared as described 37 . A bovine brain lipid extract ( type I , Folch fraction I ) was purchased from Sigma . Liposomes . Large liposomes were prepared as described 38 with some modifications . Lipids solubilized in a chloro - form : methanol ( 1 : 2 ) mixture were dried in a glass tube by passing nitrogen through the tube , then lyophilized for 2 h . The dried lipid film was hydrated by a stream of water - saturated nitrogen for 20 min . After gentle addition of degassed 0 . 3 M sucrose , the flask was flushed with nitrogen , sealed , and left undisturbed for 2 h at 37 (cid:176) C to allow spontaneous formation of liposomes . Large aggregates of lipids were removed by centrifugation . Coat fraction . Clathrin - coated vesicles were prepared from calf brains as described 39 . Coat proteins were extracted from the coated vesicles with a buffer containing 0 . 8 M Tris - Cl pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 03 % sodium azide , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride for 15 h at room temperature ( modi - fied from ref . 40 ) . Solubilized coat proteins were separated from membranes by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 1 h at room temperature . Coat proteins were either used directly or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 70 (cid:176) C . Purified proteins . Human dynamin - 1aa was produced as a GST - fusion protein using a modified Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( Gibco BRL ) as described 19 . A complementary DNA encoding GST followed by a cleavage site for PreScission protease ( Pharmacia ) was inserted into the pFastBAC1 baculovirus transfer vector ( Gibco BRL ) . The dynamin cDNA without the starting methionine was cloned into this vector downstream of the cleavage site . A recombinant virus was produced , amplified and used to infect insect Tn cells for 48 h in 1 - l spinner cultures . The fusion protein was affinity purified on glutathione – Sepha - rose - 4B and GST was removed by PreScission protease ( Pharmacia ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols . The purity of dynamin in the final material was estimated to be more than 90 % and its GTPase activity was confirmed using the EnzChek Phosphate Assay kit ( Molecular Probes ) . A full - length human amphiphysin - 1 ( ref . 24 ) was inserted into the pGEX6 - 1 vector ( Pharmacia ) , expressed in the bacterial strain DH5 a and purified according to standard procedures . After removal of GST , amphiphysin was further purified by gel filtration on Superdex - 200 to > 90 % purity . GST - fusion proteins containing amino acids 1 – 161 , 1 – 286 , 262 – 435 , 411 – 581 or 545 – 695 of human amphiphysin were produced as described 24 . A GST cDNA fragment encoding amphiphysin amino acids 1 – 286 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction , cloned into pGEX6 - 1 and purified as a GST - fusion protein as above . Cell - free incubations . Liposomes ( final concentration 0 . 1 mg ml - 1 ) were incubated in ‘cytosolic buffer’ ( 25 mM HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 4 , 25 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate , 10 mM Ca 2 + , 150 mM potassium glutamate ) for 15 min at 37 (cid:176) C with proteins and various nucleotides as indicated . The final concentration of proteins and nucleotides was as follows unless indicated otherwise : coat proteins , 0 . 5 mg ml - 1 ; purified amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 1 , 0 . 1 mg ml - 1 ; ATP , 2 mM ; GTP or GTP - g S , 200 m M . Samples containing ATP were also supplemented with an ATP - regenerating system consisting of 16 . 7 mM creatine phosphate and 16 . 7 IU ml - 1 creatine phosphokinase . Samples with coat proteins and no nucleotides were supplemented with an ATP - depleting system consisting of 5 U ml - 1 hexokinase and 10 mM glucose . Electron microscopy . For negative staining , samples were absorbed onto freshly glow - discharged Formvar - and carbon - coated electron - microscopy grids , stained with 2 % uranyl acetate for 1 min , blotted and air dried . Some samples were fixed after absorption to electron microscopy grids with 3 % glutaraldehyde . For standard electron microscopy , incubation mixtures were fixed in suspension with 3 % formaldehyde and 2 % glutaralde - hyde in 50 mM HEPES - KOH buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) and pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge . Samples were postfixed in OsO 4 , and then impregnated with 0 . 1 % tannic acid to enhance the visualization of mem - brane coats . Immunoelectron microscopy was done as described 41 . Morphometry . Association of lipid tubules with clathrin - coated buds was quantified by visually scanning negatively stained samples at the electron microscope . We observed 200 randomly chosen lipid tubules for each condition and scored them for the presence of clathrin - coated buds at their tips . Light scattering . Light scattering was measured on an Hitachi F - 3010 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 350 nm . Excita - tion and emission slit widths were set at 3 nm . Liposomes ( 100 m g ml - 1 lipid ) were incubated in cytosolic buffer at room temperature and supplemented with the following reagents as indicated in Fig . 5 : 20 m g ml - 1 dynamin , 50 m g ml - 1 amphiphysin - 1 and 1 mM GTP . GTPase - activity assay . A GTPase - activity assay measuring [ 32 P ] PO 4 release was performed as described 42 with the following modifications .
