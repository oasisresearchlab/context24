Measuring the mechanics of morphogenesis Anne - Lise Routier - Kierzkowska and Richard S Smith The past decades have seen a rapid increase in the understanding of plant morphogenesis at the molecular - genetic level . However , the control of growth and morphogenesis by molecular and signaling networks ultimately requires the coordinated regulation of mechanical properties in individual cells . There is also increasing evidence that mechanical stresses can feedback on hormone signaling and growth , and may have a central role in developmental patterning . Thus the development of techniques to investigate the mechanical properties of plant tissue at the cellular level is key to understanding growth and morphogenesis .

There is no cell movement as commonly occurs in animals . This puts limitations on the mechanisms available to the plant to generate its form and shape , with morphogenesis relying on carefully coordinated growth . Growth itself results from an interplay between biochemical and biophysical factors [ 1 , 2 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 3 , 4 (cid:2) ] . Plant cells are like small balloons , and are under considerable turgor pressure ( typically 3 – 10 atm ) resulting from the difference in osmotic potential inside and outside the cell . Containing this turgor pressure is the plant cell wall , a connected extracellular matrix made of cellulose , hemicellulose , pectins , other polysaccharides and some structural proteins [ 5 , 6 ] . Turgor pressure places the cell wall in a constant state of tension , and this gives the non - woody portions of the plant their shape and stiffness . A loss of pressure results in wilting , and collapse of the structure . In order for a plant cell to grow , it must be able to extend its cell wall , while simultaneously maintaining its structural integrity so that it does not weaken to the point of rupture . This is a remarkable accomplishment given that actively growing cells have relatively thin walls , and can increase in size by several orders of magnitude while withstanding tension in the range of 100 – 1000 atm [ 5 , 7 ] . The mechanism of cell wall extensibility is thought to occur through selective wall loosening , and remains rela - tively poorly understood [ 5 , 8 ] . Nonetheless many cell wall components and several enzymes that modify them have been identiﬁed [ 5 , 9 – 11 ] . In addition , many of the upstream molecular and signaling pathways driving morphogenesis have been uncovered [ 12 – 14 ] . In order to understand how these networks regulate cell expansion , there has been a recent trend towards integrating molecular level processes with mechanics . In the shoot apex differential mechanical properties have been suggested to have an instructive role in functional zonation [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 16 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . It has also been suggested that mechanical signals can inﬂuence the trans - port of the growth hormone auxin through microtubule orientation [ 1 , 2 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , cell pressure [ 3 ] or via specialized con - nections between the plasma membrane and the cell wall [ 17 ] . Elasticity , viscoelasticity , and plasticity Plant cell growth occurs as the cell wall is deformed in response to loading caused by turgor pressure . Several types of deformation are possible when a material is subjected to load ( see Box 1 ) . It may deform purely elastically , such that when the load is removed it returns immediately to its original shape . Tensile tests on plant tissue often show considerable elastic deformation com - bined with a time - dependent or viscoelastic response [ 18 – 20 ] . In a viscoelastic response , the material eventually returns to its original size after releasing the stress , although this may take some time [ 21 ] . Finally a material may exhibit plastic behavior . In this case the material becomes permanently stretched , and does not return to its original shape after releasing the load . Growth is con - sidered to be a plastic deformation , as the cell deforms permanently , and it is usually accompanied by the addition of new wall material , although in some cases it may involve substantial wall thinning [ 22 ] . The relationship between cell wall elasticity , viscoelasticity , turgor pressure and growth is still unclear ; however , there is some evidence for a correlation between elasticity and growth [ 16 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 23 – 25 ] . In single algae cells , step - wise increases in turgor pressure have been shown to enhance elongation rates [ 24 , 26 ] , which likely reﬂect both growth and viscoelastic deformation . On the other hand , increased cell growth rates induced by low pH in maize roots do not involve differ - ences in turgor pressure [ 27 ] . Nonetheless , most math - ematical models for growth are in some way derived from the Lockhart model [ 7 , 28 , 29 ] and propose that the cell wall will irreversibly yield after reaching a certain threshold stress resulting from turgor . For a review of the mathemat - ical models of growth see Goriely et al . [ 30 ] . It appears that plastic yielding is not a purely mechanical response , but Available online at www . sciencedirect . com www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2013 , 16 : 25 – 32 depends on both stress and enzymatic activity in the cell wall [ 21 , 31 ] . This behavior is enhanced in the presence of low extracellular pH , and has been called the acid growth theory [ 5 , 27 , 32 ] . Low pH is thought to enhance the activity of expansins , that cause cell wall remodeling and allow the wall to deform plastically , as well as modifying cell wall elasticity , making the walls less stiff [ 33 ] . Auxin is thought to trigger acid growth by enhancing ATPase activity and acidifying the cell wall . This appears to be independent of the TIR1 auxin signaling pathway [ 34 , 35 (cid:2) ] , triggering a direct short - term auxin growth response . However , extended growth induced by auxin likely depends on transcription and the downstream induction of the delivery of new wall material . The conﬂuence of these processes and their interaction with turgor is what ultimately results in growth ; however , a quantitative understanding of the mechanical changes that occur in the cell wall during growth is lacking [ 36 ] . Here we review recent develop - ments in the measurement of the mechanical properties of plant cells and tissues , and the modeling techniques used to interpret the data . Compression of single cells A straightforward way to measure plant cell mechanical properties is to take single cells and compress them between two ﬂat surfaces [ 33 , 37 ] ( Figure 1 ) . A force sensor records the load applied to the cell for a known displacement of one of the surfaces . The measured force will depend on several factors such as the size of the cell , wall thickness , cell wall elasticity and turgor pressure . In cases with simple cell geometries , it is possible to predict force – deformation curves from an analytical model of the cell . This has been done for the case of a single press - urized , liquid - ﬁlled spherical cell with a semi - permeable wall pressed between two plates [ 33 ] . Provided that initial parameters are known for the geometry of the cell , that water movement is neglected and that simple assump - tions hold for the material model of the cell wall ( linear , isotropic material , no bending stiffness , Poisson’s ratio 0 . 4 ) , we are left with two free parameters : turgor pressure and the Young’s modulus . If either of these are known , the other can be calculated from the model ﬁt of the force - displacement curve when large cell deformations are used [ 33 , 37 ] . Smith et al . [ 37 , 38 ] showed that a unique solution requires the measurement of water loss during the exper - iment , which for plant culture cells is likely to occur within seconds [ 39 ] . Thus without an accurate way to precisely measure the cell volume during compression , it is not possible to distinguish between purely elastic and viscoelastic or plastic behavior of the cell wall [ 37 ] . Similar 26 Growth and development Box 1 Explanation of some useful mechanical terms Mechanical behavior : (cid:2) Elasticity refers to a fully reversible deformation under load . The speed at which force is applied does not matter . If a load is removed from an elastic solid , it will come back instantly to its unloaded state . When the deformation ( strain ) is proportional to the force it obeys Hooke’s law , and the behavior is called linear elastic or hookean . Biological materials often exhibit non - linear elasticity . (cid:2) Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a liquid to flow . Unlike elasticity , it is a time - dependent response . (cid:2) Viscoelastic materials exhibit both viscous and elastic behavior when undergoing deformation . The effective stiffness depends on the rate of loading . The time - dependent , viscous response causes force relaxation under a constant deformation , or the sample to creep ( deform with time ) when a load is maintained . If a load is removed from a viscoelastic solid , it can slowly return to its original shape provided that no plastic deformation has occurred . (cid:2) Plasticity occurs when a solid does not recover its original shape after removing a load . The amount of plastic deformation depends on the force applied and time . Cell growth is due to a plastic deformation of the wall that yields under turgor pressure . Viscoelastic behavior can be misinterpreted as plastic deformation if the sample is not allowed enough time to come back to its original shape . Quantities : (cid:2) Stiffness ( K ) : force divided by displacement . Measures the rigidity of an object , which depends on its shape . For example , the bending stiffness of a thin aluminum foil is much less than that of a spoon from the same metal . Unit : N / m . (cid:2) Hardness ( h ) : force over permanent ( plastic ) deformation . Values and unit depend on the experimental method used . (cid:2) Strain ( e ) : relative deformation . Unit - less . (cid:2) Stress ( s ) : force divided by area . It can be tensile or compressive . Unit : N / m 2 , Pa , bar or atm . (cid:2) Pressure ( P ) : force divided by area . Unit : N / m 2 , Pa , bar or atm . (cid:2) Young’s modulus ( E ) : stress divided by strain . Intrinsic property of a linear elastic material , independent of the object shape or the measuring method . Same unit as stress . (cid:2) Storage and loss modulus ( E 0 , E 00 ) : measures of elastic ( storage ) and viscous ( loss ) component of the stress – strain response in viscoelastic solid . Same unit as stress . (cid:2) Poisson’s ratio ( y ) : ratio of strain in one direction over strain in another . Measure of compressibility . Unit - less . Models : (cid:2) Analytical models are purely mathematical models ( equations ) and can predict mechanical behavior if the system geometry is relatively simple ( highly symmetrical ) . For example , the Hertz model was originally developed to describe the contact between two homo - geneous elastic spheres . Variants of the Hertz model are used to analyze the contact between an indenter of known shape ( cylindrical , pyramidal , conical ) and an infinitely thick , flat piece of homogeneous linear elastic material . (cid:2) Numerical simulations are used when analytical models are too difficult to solve , often because of geometrical complexity . The Finite Element Method ( FEM ) is most often used for mechanical simulations because it can handle arbitrary geometries . The method can be used to predict local stresses and strains in cells and tissues . Thin objects such as the cell wall can be represented by a membrane ( 2D elements with no resistance to bending , no thickness ) , a shell ( 2D elements that possess bending stiffness ) or solid elements ( full 3D elements ) .

This is the principle behind ball tonometry [ 41 , 42 ] . Micro - indentation Micro - indentation can be used to measure and apply forces to both single cells and cells in intact plant tissues . Similar to compression experiments , micro - indentation involves monitoring the force needed to indent a small probe into the cell wall . The indenter is usually ﬂat or rounded , a few micrometers in diameter ( 1 – 5 m m ) , and is typically used with indentation depths comparable to or larger than the cell wall thickness ( see Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . The force – displacement data from micro - indentation experiments are affected by a variety of factors . Cell and indenter geometry , turgor pressure , contact angle ( Figure 2 ) and cell wall elasticity all play a role in the resulting measurements [ 43 , 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 45 ] . As with compression experiments , analytical models can be used to extract values of elasticity and turgor pressure , but only for quite restrictive assumptions and very simple cell and indenter geometries . This is possible , for example , in the case of a spherical cell with a point load [ 46 (cid:2) ] . More complicated geometries and a much wider range of assumptions can be accommodated with numerical models , such as those simulated with the ﬁnite element method ( FEM ) [ 37 , 43 , 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 45 ] . This allows the analysis of how various geometric factors such as cell and indenter size and shape , contact angle , indentation depth and so on affect the measurement . If the indenter diameter is much larger than cell wall thickness , local compression of the cell wall can be neglected , and the wall can be modeled as a membrane ( no bending stiffness ) or shell [ 43 , 45 , 46 (cid:2) ] . If the indenter diameter is similar to , or smaller than the cell wall thickness , the measurement is inﬂuenced by both local cell wall compression and a more a global defor - mation . To accurately model this situation , full 3D solid elements can be used in place of ( or in conjunction with ) shell or membrane elements ( see Box 1 ) . Routier - Kierz - kowska et al . [ 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] used this approach to model onion 28 Growth and development Figure 2 ααα F n F z d z d n Current Opinion in Plant Biology Effect of the indentation angle on force measurements . Plant tissues have a curved surface , and during micro - indentation or nano - indentation experiments the probe axis will not always be perpendicular to the cell surface . The probe tip indents the cell at angle a , which influences force - displacement data used to extract the sample elasticity . Only the component of the force in the axis of the probe F z will be measured , and will be less than the actual force F n for a > 0 . In addition , the vertical displacement d z will be larger than the actual indentation depth d n , again resulting in a lower stiffness measurement . In the case of frictionless contact illustrated here , the reaction force is normal to the surface . Friction between the tip and the sample would result in a higher force measured in the z direction and a higher stiffness measured on the slope . A lateral force is acting on the probe tip during indentation . If the indenter is long and flexible , it will bend by a small angle , resulting in a smaller indentation depth d n . Hence , the tip bending stiffness , which depends on its shape and stiffness modulus , has to be taken into account in the measurements if long , thin probes are used . Figure 1 Nano - indentation Force range : 1 - 100 nN Micro - indentation Force range : 1 - 100 μ N Single cell compression Force range : 10 - 1000 μ N Current Opinion in Plant Biology Different indentation methods at various scales . In all cases an indenter deforms the cell while both position and the force applied are recorded . The size of the indenter tip and indentation depth relative to cell dimensions ( size and wall thickness ) determine what material properties are reflected in force - indentation data . Large cell deformations resulting from single cell compression are used to measure both turgor pressure and how stretchable ( elastic ) the cell wall is laterally [ 33 , 37 ] . Micro - indentation results are sensitive to turgor pressure , cell wall elasticity , cell and tip geometry as well as indentation angle [ 43 , 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 45 , 56 ] . Nano - indentation is used to deform the cell wall locally [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 50 , 52 ] and determine its elastic modulus mostly in the direction normal to the surface [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Under some conditions , nano - indentation data can also be sensitive to turgor pressure [ 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2013 , 16 : 25 – 32 www . sciencedirect . com epidermal cells . The mechanical effects of the presence of neighbor cells beside the cell being indented were considered in the model . It was shown that the level of turgor pressure inﬂuences both the global apparent stiff - ness and how local the measurement is for a given force . For higher pressure , cell wall deformation is restricted to a small region , mostly resulting in wall compression , whereas lower pressures result in a deeper indentation and a more global deformation the cell . Nano - indentation Nano - indentation is commonly used in material sciences to determine elasticity ( Young’s modulus ) and plasticity ( hardness ) of solid materials ( see Box 1 for terminology ) . A common device that can be used for nano - indentation is the Atomic Force Microscope ( AFM ) . The AFM uses very precise piezoelectric actuators to impose a deformation ( in the nanometer range ) that is negligible compared to the specimen thickness . The force obtained during the defor - mation is determined by optically monitoring the deﬂec - tion of a cantilever upon which a pyramidal tip is mounted . The sample elasticity is then determined is then deter - mined by ﬁtting the force – displacement curve to a math - ematical model of the contact between tip and sample . Data from nano - indentation experiments are most com - monly interpreted by using the Hertz model and its exten - sions [ 47 , 48 ] . The sample is approximated as an isotropic , linear elastic solid occupying an inﬁnitely extending half space . It is assumed that the indenter is not deformable and that contact is frictionless . If these conditions are met the sample Young’s modulus ( also called elastic modulus , E ) can be calculated provided that the indenter shape and Poisson’s ratio are known . Nano - indentation methods have been recently applied to living plant cells to measure elasticity and viscoelasticity of the primary cell wall [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 49 (cid:2) , 50 , 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 52 ] ( Table 1 ) . Using AFM with a sharp indenter tip and small displace - ments ( < 100 nm ) , the cell wall modulus was directly extracted from experimental data [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 52 ] . The idea is to deform the cell wall so locally that the effects of turgor pressure and the support by the underlying tissue would be negligible ( Figure 1 ) . Young’s modulus was computed from force - deformation curves using a Hertz model for a pyramidal indenter shape . In order to apply the Hertz model , it is assumed that the experiment is equivalent to indenting a ﬂat , homogeneous elastic material of inﬁnite thickness . This assumption can be valid for very shallow indentations [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] that do not result in cell wall bending , or displacement of the inside surface of the outermost cell wall . To overcome this issue , Hayot and co - workers combined the classical Hertz - based interpret - ation with a ﬁnite element mechanical simulation that includes turgor pressure from inside the cell [ 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Using a sharp pyramidal tip on a nano - indentation machine , they indented to a depth of 110 nm in order to avoid surface effects , such as the presence of a soft cuticle layer , adhesion and surface irregularities . Stiffness values were extracted from the slope of unloading curves close to maximal indentation and analyzed using an extended Hertz model [ 48 ] . The apparent elastic modulus values obtained reﬂect both cell wall modulus and the inﬂuence of other factors such as cell wall thickness and turgor pressure . An FEM model of the upper cell wall under pressure was then used to simulate indentation exper - iments . Values of Young’s modulus for the cell wall were ﬁt so that the simulation produced the same apparent modulus as in the experiments . The work of Hayot et al . [ 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] showed that the apparent modulus extracted directly from experimental data using Hertz - based models could be as much as eight times lower than the elastic modulus of the cell wall estimated using FEM simulations . Peaucelle et al . [ 49 (cid:2) ] performed indentation experiments on the shoot apex using AFM . Their work can be classi - ﬁed as micro - indentation because they used indenter sizes of 1 m m and 5 m m . Experiments were done on plasmolized tissues at an indentation depth of 0 . 5 m m , and analyzed with a Hertz model . The apparent modulus extracted using the 1 m m and 5 m m indenters was inter - preted by the authors as reﬂecting tissue elasticity at different depths , which does not satisfy the homogeneity constraint of the Hertz model . Nonetheless , if indenta - tion parameters are kept consistent the method can be used to give a qualitative view of the relative stiffness of different areas in a sample . Manipulation of turgor pressure The manipulation of turgor pressure can also be used to measure cell wall stiffness by monitoring the change in cell size in relation to pressure changes . Unlike nano - indentation methods , the method is mostly sensitive to in - plane cell wall stiffness , and therefore can be used to test the inﬂuence of the cellulose microﬁbrils on cell expansion . For very large cells , turgor pressure can be manipulated directly with the pressure probe ( reviewed by Tomos and Leigh [ 53 ] ) . By injecting or removing a known volume of liquid , the resulting pressure change can be used to determine the average cell wall stiffness [ 24 , 54 , 55 ] . In addition to direct measurements of turgor pressure , the pressure probe can be used to obtain internal osmotic potential [ 27 ] by withdrawing a sample of the cell contents and determining its freezing point . By following pressure changes over time , water permeability of the cell can be determined [ 55 ] . It is also possible to manipulate turgor by submersing plant tissue into solutions with different osmotic poten - tials [ 31 ] . This can be used with any cell size , and is less invasive than the pressure probe . Osmotic treatments require a means to precisely quantify the deformation of the tissue in response to change in osmolarity since , unlike turgor manipulation with the pressure probe , the Measuring the mechanics of morphogenesis Routier - Kierzkowska and Smith 29 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2013 , 16 : 25 – 32 change in volume is generally not known . This can be a challenge for smaller cells , especially when the defor - mations are very small . Kierzkowski et al . [ 16 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] have developed a method to precisely track surface expansion by combining osmotic treatments with confocal laser scanning microscopy . Using this method different zones of elastic behavior in the shoot apex were shown . Fast growing areas in the peripheral zone were much easier to expand with hypo - osmotic treatment than the slower growing cells in the central zone . Conclusions Indentation experiments on the nano - scale and micro - scale are being increasingly used to determine turgor pressure and cell wall elastic and viscoelastic properties , and in some cases these have been combined with genetic approaches [ 4 (cid:2) , 49 (cid:2) , 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Depending on indentation depth and tip geometry , experimental results will be more or less sensitive to turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity [ 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 46 (cid:2) , 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . To extract these quantities , a model is required to ﬁt the force - indentation curves . For indentations with very small tips at depths that are signiﬁcantly smaller than the cell wall thickness , the measurement is mostly sensitive to wall elasticity in the direction normal to the surface [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 52 ] . In this case the Hertz model or one of its derivatives can be used to interpret the experiments [ 15 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 50 , 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 52 ] . Lar - ger indentations can be used to measure both turgor pressure and in - plane elasticity if the deformation is large enough to signiﬁcantly stretch the cell wall [ 37 , 44 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 51 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . However , except for very simple cell and indenter geo - metries , the interpretation of results is much more com - plex . To address this issue , engineering - style mechanical models of cells and tissues are used , with FEM simulation being the most common approach . Even if all of the geometric parameters in the model are known , the simu - lations typically still have too many free parameters to get a direct measurement of elasticity and pressure . To address this , some authors combine indentation exper - iments with other approaches , such as osmotic treatments or pressure - probe measurements [ 37 , 40 , 45 ] . In addition to pressure and elasticity of the cell wall , viscous and plastic behavior of the cell might also be observed , depending on the timescale of the experiments . This can come from several sources , such as water movement in and out of the cell and viscous or plastic behavior of the cell wall itself . In the past few years several exciting new techniques have been developed to examine plant tissue mechanics in the context of morphogenesis . All of these techniques rely on mathematical and simulation models to interpret experimental results . Currently , quantitative models exist only for very simple geometries involving single cells . A future challenge is to extend these models to multi - cellular structures , such as the shoot and root apex , so that they can be used to interpret indentation experiments in plant organs . This , combined with genetic approaches , will be a crucial step towards understanding how genes and signaling networks regulate the mechan - ical properties of cells controlling growth and develop - ment .

Plant J 2011 , 67 : 1116 - 1123 . This is the ﬁrst nano - indentation work on the shoot apex with AFM . It shows differences in cell wall elasticity in between the central and peripheral zones of the shoot apex of Arabidopsis pin1 mutants . The authors use AFM with small tips and indentation depths , and report similar results regardless of turgor . Samples are tilted when indenting the peripheral zone in order to avoid artifacts from the angle of indentation 16 .

Science 2012 , 335 : 1096 - 1099 . Using specialized software to track small deformations in cells from confocal images , the authors manipulate turgor pressure to investigate the elastic properties of the shoot apex . They found that the slow growing central zone of the shoot apex was difﬁcult to expand with osmotic treatments compared to the surrounding rapidly growing peripheral zone . They propose that strain stiffening could be a mechanism of mechanical regulation of the stem cell niche 17 .
