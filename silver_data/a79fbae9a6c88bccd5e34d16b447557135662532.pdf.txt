REVIEW ARTICLE Development and application of probes for labeling the actin cytoskeleton in living plant cells Fei Du & Haiyun Ren Received : 31 May 2010 / Accepted : 14 August 2010 / Published online : 28 August 2010 # Springer - Verlag 2010 Abstract The actin cytoskeleton is one of the most important components of eukaryotic cytoskeletons . It participates in numerous crucial procedures of cells and has been studied by using various methods . The develop - ment and application of appropriate probes for actin visualization is the first and foremost step for functional analysis of actin in vivo . Since the actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic and sensitive structure , methods previously used to visualize actin often harm cells and cannot reveal the native state of the actin cytoskeleton in living cells . The development of labeling technologies for living plant cells , especially the emergence and application of green fluores - cent protein - tagged actin markers , has provided new insights into the structure and function of the actin cytoskeleton in vivo . There has been a number of probes for actin labeling in living plant cells though they each present different advantages and defects . In this review , we discuss and compare those widely used methods for actin visualization and analysis . Keywords Actin cytoskeleton . Labeling method . Fluorescent probes . Living plant cell Introduction Actin filaments ( AFs ) or filamentous actins ( F - actin ) are formed from global actin ( G - actin ) monomers , which associate to form fibrous structures approximately 7 nm in diameter . These structures can be further organized into complex and dynamic networks in vivo through cross - linking , bundling , or other associations . As an important part of the cytoskeleton system , the actin cytoskeleton participates in cell morphogenesis , endocytosis , intracellu - lar transportation , cytokinesis , cell mobility , and signal transduction ( Pollard and Cooper 2009 ; Staiger et al . 2010 ) . The use of appropriate probes to label the actin cytoskeleton and obtain fine images of its native state is crucial for investigating actin function . Labeling techniques used in previous studies include immunofluorescence using an actin antibody ( Cande et al . 1977 ) , labeling of heavy meromyosin and observation by electron microscopy ( Kersey and Wessells 1976 ) , and staining by fluorescent phallotoxin or fluorescent phalloidin , which specifically bind to actin filaments ( Wulf et al . 1979 ) . Although these methods have provided considerable information about the organization of the actin cytoskeleton , they have some limitations . These techniques are technically demanding , and chemical treatments such as fixation and permeabiliza - tion can destroy native actin organization , leading to inaccurate labeling . Most importantly , none of these methods can be used to observe the dynamics of actin filaments in living cells ( Lloyd and Traas 1988 ; Kovar et al . 2001 ; Higaki et al . 2006 ) . Imaging in living cells allows the visualization of cytoskeletal structures as they change in response to growth conditions ( Vidali et al . 2009 ) and thus provides an opportunity to visualize the organization of native actin filaments . Microinjection of both fluorescent phalloidin and fluorescent actin analogs allow living observations of actin filaments in plant cells ( Schmit and Lambert 1990 ; Zhang et al . 1993 ; Ren and Yuan 2000 ) . Whereas phalloidin can disturb the dynamic balance of actin filaments , fluorescent Handling Editor : David Robinson F . Du : H .

For this reason , fluorescent actin analogs have been used for research on actin functions in vivo ( Ren 1999 ; Ren and Yuan 2000 ) . However , fluores - cent dyes such as FITC and Oregon Green are susceptible to photobleaching . Recent developments in fusion technol - ogies for green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) and other fluorescent proteins ( FPs ) have enabled more convenient and reliable observations of the dynamic behaviors of actin filaments in living plant cells while minimizing negative impacts . These live probes usually use a fluorescent protein - tagged actin monomer ( GFP - actin ) and a full - length protein or protein domain that binds specifically to actin filaments ( Wasteneys and Yang 2004 ; Wang et al . 2007 ) . Using these probes has provided new insights into some special dynamic behaviors of actin filaments during many cellular processes . In this review , we discuss the recent developments in cellular probes used to determine the structure and function of the actin cytoskeleton in living plant cells . This information will further our understanding of labeling technologies for actin filaments and provide references for discovery of novel approaches . Microinjection into plant cells for the visualization of actin structures Microinjection of fluorescent phalloidin Phalloidin , which specifically binds to actin , is a fungal toxin isolated from the poisonous mushroom Amanita phalloides . Most of the existing knowledge about the actin cytoskeleton has been obtained through fluorescent phal - loidin staining after chemical treatments of cells . As actin is highly sensitive to fixation and permeabilization ( Lloyd and Traas 1988 ) , such procedures may result in artificial rearrangements of actin filaments ( Schmit and Lambert 1990 ) . Although some progress has been made in the development of in vivo staining methods that do not involve fixation ( Tewinkel et al . 1989 ; Olyslaegers and Verbelen 1998 ) , diverse permeabilization treatments may still destroy the cell membrane and membranous organelles . Fluorescent phalloidin is not membrane permeable , and therefore , the most appropriate delivery technique is microinjection of living cells with minute amounts of this drug ( Olyslaegers and Verbelen 1998 ) . Since microinjection of fluorescent phalloidin was first used in higher plants ( Schmit and Lambert 1990 ) , this method has shed new light on observation of the dynamics of F - actin in vivo , especially the role of actin in plant mitosis and cytokinesis . However , the method is technically demanding and its application is restricted to certain types of plant cells such as endosperm cells of Haemanthus katherinae ( Schmit and Lambert 1990 ) , Tradescantia virginiana L . stamen hair cells ( Cleary et al . 1992 ) , living guard cells of Commelina communis L . ( Kim et al . 1995 ) , pollen tubes of Lilium longiflorum ( Miller et al . 1996 ) and isolated egg cells of wheat ( Pónya and Barnabás 2001 ) . However , since the phalloidin injection method does not include a fixation step , the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are severely altered by the injection process ( Ren and Yuan 2000 ) . Whether used as a stain or in microinjection , phalloidin itself stabilizes F - actin , and thereby alters the dynamic activity of the actin cytoskeleton . It is generally acknowledged , therefore , that phalloidin can give artificial results in terms of actin structure . Therefore , neither staining nor microin - jection by fluorescent phalloidin is an ideal method to study actin filaments in living cells ( Estes et al . 1981 ; Sampath and Pollard 1991 ; Kovar et al . 2001 ; Wang et al . 2007 ; Zhang et al . 2009 ) . To minimize these detrimental effects , one can reduce the concentration of phalloidin and improve the sensitivity of imaging . Microinjection of fluorescent actin analogs Fluorescent analog cytochemistry is a more suitable method for studying the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton , because it uses the normal components of the actin cytoskeleton and has little effect on its dynamic move - ments . By labeling actin with fluorescent dyes and introducing the labeled actin into living cells by microin - jection , the endogenous cytoskeletal arrays can incorporate the labeled actin through the turnover of the cytoskeleton system ( Ren and Yuan 2000 ) . Previous in vitro experiments have generally used actin from animal muscles . However , it has been found that the fluorescent analogs of these animal actins cannot be incorporated into the plant cytoskeleton system when they are injected into living plant cells ( Ren 1999 ) . Ren et al . ( 1997 ) reported a method for purifying actin from maize pollen that enabled more effective and convenient preparation of fluorescent plant actin analogs . The double injection of purified pollen actin and fluores - cent phalloidin into T . virginiana L . stamen hair cells demonstrated that exogenous actin did not perturb cyto - skeletal organization or function in live cells . Ren and coworkers first labeled plant actin with fluorescent dye and then introduced these fluorescent actin analogs into living plant cells ( Ren 1999 ; Ren and Yuan 2000 ) . The prepared actin fluorescent analog was able to incorporate into the actin cytoskeleton via turnover . Compared with the actin cytoskeleton visualized by microinjection of rhodamine – phalloidin , the actin filaments revealed using fluorescent actin were finer and thinner . This result suggested that the microinjection of fluorescent actin analogs might not cause 240 F . Du , H . Ren actin assembly and therefore may reflect the true state of actin dynamics in living plant cells ( Ren and Yuan 2000 ) . Thus , the microinjection of fluorescent actin analogs is more reliable than that of fluorescent phalloidin , but the same limitations exist ; that is , the method is technically demanding , and is limited to certain cell types . Labeling of actin by expression of fluorescent fusion protein in living plant cells Expression of GFP - actin Green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is a fluorescent protein that has been widely used in investigations of almost all biological processes in cells . GFP has many advantages as a marker . The formation of its chromophore is cell - autonomous in that it requires only molecular oxygen . In addition , GFP is photostable , being strongly resistant to photobleaching and other stresses , and the quality of its fluorescence is not affected by its fusion to other proteins ( Chiu et al . 1996 ; Chytilova et al . 1999 ) . These advantages make GFP an attractive fluorescent tag for actin cytoskeleton labeling . GFP imaging does not require staining or other harmful procedures and allows for analysis of cells in a relatively undisturbed , living state . GFP directly fused to actin has been used in many studies . Expression of GFP - actin fusion proteins potentially labels F - actin and pools of G - actin . GFP - actin labeling has been used to observe actin localization in cells of Dictyostelium discoideum ( Aizawa et al . 1997 ; Westphal et al . 1997 ) , yeast ( Doyle and Botstein 1996 ) , Drosophila melanogaster ( Verkhushaa et al . 1999 ) , and mammals ( Ballestrem et al . 1998 ; Fischer et al . 1998 ) . However , expression of GFP - actin can have severe impacts on cell morphogenesis and function . For example , expression of GFP - actin severely affected the morphology and function of D . discoideum cells ( Aizawa et al . 1997 ) , possibly as a result of the large increase in the number of actin monomers that occurs during overexpression of GFP - actin fusion proteins . These monomers play important roles for the maintenance of cell shape and function ( Yoneda et al . 2007 ) . Expression of GFP - ABPs GFP - mTalin tag The organization and dynamics of actin filaments are regulated by various actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) that can bind to monomeric actin , filamentous actin , or both . Therefore , it is feasible to label the actin cytoskeleton using fusion proteins of GFP fused to certain ABPs . In fact , that method has provided a vast quantity of useful information about the structures and functions of the actin cytoskeleton during plant development ( Wang et al . 2004 ; Ye et al . 2009 ) . The first tagged actin - binding protein used in plants was the talin protein from mouse ( mTalin or mTn ) ( Kost et al . 1998 ) . The actin - binding domain ( ABD ) located in the C - terminal of the talin protein is highly conserved among a diverse group of ABPs . It binds actin filaments with a higher affinity than the full - length protein but , in contrast to the latter , does not nucleate actin polymerization ( McCann and Craig 1997 ) . Therefore , this domain appears to be an ideal tag to fuse with GFP for actin labeling . Kost et al . constructed a fusion protein of GFP - mTalin that was stably expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana plants and transiently expressed in tobacco BY - 2 ( Nicotiana tabacum L . cv Bright Yellow ) cells and tobacco pollen tubes . The patterns of green GFP fluorescence and red rhodamine – phalloidin fluorescence emitted from double - labeled BY - 2 cells were essentially identical , indicating that GFP - mTalin can spe - cifically label the plant actin cytoskeleton . Transient expression of GFP - mTalin did not affect morphology or mitosis in BY - 2 cells . In A . thaliana , constitutive expres - sion of GFP - mTalin labeled actin filaments in diverse cell types , including epidermal cells of hypocotyl , root , and cotyledon , with no detrimental effects on morphology or development ( Kost et al . 1998 ) . Using GFP - mTalin and fusion proteins of mTalin with other fluorescent tags ( e . g . , YFP - mTalin ) gives a new approach for observing the actin cytoskeleton . Such strategies have been widely used in diverse tissues of various plants including A . thaliana epidermal and trichome cells ( Mathur et al . 1999 ; Mathur and Chua 2000 ; Ilgenfritz et al . 2003 ; Li et al . 2003 ) , root hairs ( Ketelaar et al . 2004 ; Yi et al . 2005 ) , and pollen tubes ( Ketelaar et al . 2004 ; Yi et al . 2005 ) ; tobacco BY - 2 cells ( Yu et al . 2006 ) , leaf pavement cells ( Brandizzi et al . 2002 ) , and pollen tubes ( Wilsen et al . 2006 ) ; Lilium pollen tubes ( Wilsen et al . 2006 ) ; rice coleoptiles ( Holweg et al . 2004 ) ; onion epidermal cells ( Xu and Scheres 2005 ) ; and cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens ( Finka et al . 2007 ) . The quality of GFP - mTalin labeling relies on cell types ; the labeling of actin arrays is more subtle in certain cell types , such as various epidermal cells and pollen tubes , than in others ( Wasteneys and Yang 2004 ; Voigt et al . 2005 ) . Nevertheless , it has been reported that GFP - mTalin might cause some problems . High levels of GFP - mTalin expression cause thick actin cables and slow cytoplasmic streaming in tobacco pollen tubes and result in premature cessation of growth ( Kost et al . 1998 ) . Using an ethanol - inducible system , Ketelaar et al . ( 2004 ) found that over - expression of GFP - mTalin destroyed actin organization in Development and application of probes for actin cytoskeleton 241 A . thaliana root hairs and consequently led to changed cell shapes , inhibition of growth , and even cell death . However , this may have been due , at least in part , to the effect of transient expression by the ethanol - inducible system be - cause these severe phenotypes were not observed in lines constitutively expressing GFP - mTalin . Voigt et al . ( 2005 ) also showed that GFP - mTalin seedlings have slightly decreased hypocotyl growth and a significantly slower gravitropic response . These phenotypes may be due to the high level of GFP - mTalin expression , which affects the natural dynamics of actin filaments in vivo . For instance , the universally increased actin bundles in GFP - mTalin transgenic lines may result from competition of this marker with endogenous actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) and even other ABPs because experiments in vitro have revealed that GFP - mTalin can inhibit the actin depolyme - rizing activity through hindering the interaction of ADF with F - actin ( Ketelaar et al . 2004 ) . However , the excessive bundling effect caused by overexpression of YFP - mTalin in tobacco BY - 2 cells and rice has been used to determine the biological functions of actin configuration in the context of auxin transport . The studies suggest that auxin regulates its own transport by changing the state of actin filaments ( Maisch and Nick 2007 ; Nick et al . 2009 ) . Besides , this undesired side effect of GFP - mTalin differs in its severity among different cell types . Some are more sensitive to this fusion tag , while others are less so ( Kost et al . 1998 ) . GFP - fimbrin / plastin tag A . thaliana fimbrin1 ( AtFim1 ) was the first plant actin - binding protein used for tracking the spatial and temporal distribution of actin filaments in vivo ( Kovar et al . 2001 ) . AtFim1 is a member of the fimbrin / plastin family of actin filament bundling or cross - linking proteins ( Kovar et al . 2000 ) . Two conservative actin - binding domains ( ABD1 and ABD2 ) are localized in the single peptide chain of AtFim1 , and each contains a 27 - amino - acid fragment ( BD1 and BD2 , respectively ) ( McCurdy and Kim 1998 ; Wang et al . 2004 ) . K d values in vitro showed that ABD2 has stronger affinity than ABD1 for F - actin ( Kovar et al . 2000 ; Nakano et al . 2001 ) . There have been many studies of AtFim1 labeling , in which full - length or truncated AtFim1 proteins fused to GFP were used as probes . The results of these studies indicate that these probes have different labeling features ( Kovar et al . 2001 ; Wang et al . 2004 ; Sheahan et al . 2004 ; Bannigan and Baskin 2005 ) . Microinjection of Oregon Green - labeled AtFim1 into T . virginiana L . stamen hair cells or transient expression of AtFim1 - GFP in epidermal cells of tobacco and onion can decorate intricate and dynamic cortical networks of actin filaments , but both methods result in a fluorescence signal in the cytoplasmic background ( Kovar et al . 2001 ; Wang et al . 2004 ; Sheahan et al . 2004 ) . This is also observed during constitutive expression of AtFim1 - GFP in various cell types of A . thaliana root . AtFim1 - GFP also shows mostly diffuse fluorescence and few actin filaments in meristem cells and growing root hairs ( Wang et al . 2004 ; Voigt et al . 2005 ) . Truncated AtFim1 proteins , including ABD1 - GFP and its more conserved segment BD1 - GFP , label diffuse fluorescence rather than filamentous structures in leaf epidermal cells of tobacco . This is a result of the lower affinity of AtFim1 for F - actin in vitro ( Wang et al . 2004 ; Sheahan et al . 2004 ) . However , ABD2 - GFP and the segment containing the two conserved BD domains ( BD1 / 2 - GFP ) can decorate more sophisticated and dynamic actin networks than GFP - mTalin in various cell types . ABD2 - GFP also labeled more subtle actin filaments in the transition zone between the meristem zone and the elongation zone , and its expression did not result in fluorescent aggregates in specific cell regions . By contrast , plants with extremely high levels of BD1 / 2 - GFP showed stunted growth compared with the wild - type , and plant lines expressing BD1 / 2 - GFP showed silenced and weak fluorescence in the meristem but thick fluorescent aggre - gates in cells at the root – hypocotyl junctions and hypo - cotyls ( Wang et al . 2004 ; Voigt et al . 2005 ) . Plastin proteins belong to another subfamily of the fimbrin / plastin family . One plastin tag used as a probe in living plant cells is the C terminus of truncated human T - plastin fused with GFP . Plastin - GFP labeled thick filament bundles and nuclei in Medicago root epidermal cells but presented a diffuse signal rather than fibrous structures in Medicago root hairs ( Voigt et al . 2005 ) . GFP - fABD2 tag Sheahan et al . ( 2004 ) fused GFP with the N - terminal of ABD2 of AtFim1 . Like ABD2 - GFP , the GFP - fABD2 fusion protein labeled highly dynamic and dense actin networks in diverse species and cell types . These results demonstrated that GFP fused to either the N - or C - terminal has no obvious influence on the labeling characteristics . Compared with full - length AtFim1 , microfilament bundling is avoided by trimming the gene to encode only one of fimbrin ' s actin - binding domains ( Wasteneys and Yang 2004 ) . In addition , GFP - fABD2 labeling reveals structural details not seen with the commonly used GFP - mTalin labeling method and has no detectable adverse effects on plant morphology or development . In contrast , however , plants expressing GFP - mTalin showed reduced cell elon - gation , resulting in plants with stunted growth and reduced seed set ( Sheahan et al . 2004 ) . Voigt et al . ( 2005 ) showed that GFP - fABD2 labeling was superior for labeling actin filaments of deeply embedded cells , especially stelar and statocyte cells and cells in the root meristem . However , 242 F . Du , H . Ren GFP - mTalin was more suitable for labeling in cell layers close to the organ ' s surface and resulted in only diffuse or no fluorescence from deeper cell layers . Another disadvan - tage of GFP - mTalin is that it induces rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton , such as shorter , more branched , and more convoluted filament networks with increased bun - dling and greatly reduced dynamism ( Sheahan et al . 2004 ; Sano et al . 2005 ; Ketelaar et al . 2004 ) . When expressed at high levels , GFP - mTalin can result in transverse hoops and small mobile rings of actin in live cells ( Wilsen et al . 2006 ) . Holweg ( 2007 ) reported that GFP - fABD2 slightly affected the motility of organelles and the transport of auxin in plant cells . Other groups have obtained consistent results that GFP - fABD2 or ABD2 - GFP expressed in Arabidopsis seedlings result in slightly extended primary roots and hypocotyls because of an increase in the average length of epidermal cells ( Sheahan et al . 2004 ; Voigt et al . 2005 ; Wang et al . 2007 ) . In addition , root hairs of seedlings expressing GFP - fABD2 or ABD2 - GFP showed slightly higher growth rates than those of wild - type roots ( Voigt et al . 2005 ; Wang et al . 2007 ) . Thus , it is clear that GFP - fABD2 can accelerate the growth of both diffusely and tip - growing cell types to some extent . Despite the fact that those phenotypes are subtle and harmless to plant morpho - genesis , the expression level still should be controlled in transgenic seedlings . If expressed at high levels , either GFP - mTalin or GFP - fABD2 would change the original actin arrays . In contrast to GFP - mTalin , which was expressed at high relative levels but continued to label highly bundled actin structures , GFP - fABD2 - expressing cells at similar levels of GFP fluorescence always caused cytoplasmic accumulation ( Sheahan et al . 2004 ; Wilsen et al . 2006 ) . This finding may reflect differences in the affinity of the C - terminal actin - binding domain of talin and ABD2 of AtFim1 for binding to plant actin filaments . Alternative - ly , it could reflect a reduced number of available binding sites for GFP - fABD2 , given the presence of endogenous fimbrins . A low level of GFP - fABD2 expression may be vital for its accurate labeling of actin networks in live plant cells ( Sheahan et al . 2004 ) . Inducible promoters could be used to control the expression level of these probes . GFP - fABD2 labeling has revealed some special actin structures that could not be seen using GFP - mTalin labeling . Sano et al . ( 2005 ) observed a “ twin peaks ” structure of actin filaments in the metaphase cell cortex in a stably transformed BY - 2 cell line ( BY - GF11 ) . The “ twin peaks ” of actin filaments are thought to play a role in guiding the movement of cell plates . In our own laboratory , the precise structure and dynamics of AFs during the initiation and late lateral expansion of the phragmoplast have been studied in a tobacco BY - 2 cell line stably expressing GFP - fABD2 . This has revealed new information that was not evident in our previous studies using GFP - mTalin for labeling ( Yu et al . 2006 ; Zhang et al . 2009 ) . This may be due to the nuclear localization of GFP - mTalin . That is , GFP - mTalin shows intense fluorescence in nuclei at interphase and around the nuclear zone during mitosis ; hence , some subtle and dynamic structures near the nuclei might be obscured ( Zhang et al . 2009 ) . GFP - fABD2 - GFP tag Wang et al . 2007 used an improved method in which a construct containing GFP fused to both the C - and N - terminals of ABD2 of AtFim1 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus ( CaMV ) 35S promoter ( 35S : : GFP - ABD2 - GFP ) was expressed in plant cells , resulting in enhanced in vivo F - actin imaging . Compared with the original ABD2 - GFP approach , 35S : : GFP - ABD2 - GFP resulted in superior quality of F - actin labeling in specific regions of tissues and cells , such as in the root meristem and lateral roots of A . thaliana seedlings . In cells of the root meristem , it highlights the fine F - actin networks surround - ing the nuclei during interphase and phragmoplasts during cytokinesis without affecting cell division . In cells or tissues with highly dynamic actin filaments , such as guard cells and pollen tubes , GFP - ABD2 - GFP does not disturb the F - actin dynamics or cellular responses to environmental cues . In addition , GFP - ABD2 - GFP is a superior probe for visualizing actin filaments of root vasculature and lateral roots , and therefore , is an important tool for studying actin dynamics during the initiation of lateral roots ( Wang et al . 2007 ) . Although this approach has not been widely used , the quality of F - actin labeling and the ease of imaging provided by GFP - ABD2 - GFP exceed those of the original ABD2 - GFP lines . The addition of extra GFP molecules can boost fluorescence spectral yield for F - actin labeling while reducing the confocal microscope excitation setting re - quired for data collection ( Wang et al . 2007 ) . GFP - ABD2 - GFP has been used successfully to acquire fine actin cytoskeleton images in several different systems . In studies of plant development , Bernal et al . ( 2008 ) expressed GFP - ABD2 - GFP in A . thaliana mutants defective in several different cellulose synthase - like genes and observed diverse structures of actin filaments located in the apex zone of root hairs . The ARP2 / 3 complex ( actin related protein 2 / 3 complex ) , a highly conserved nucleator of F - actin poly - merization , and its activator , the SCAR complex , play important roles in leaf epidermal cell morphogenesis in Arabidopsis . Using a GFP - ABD2 - GFP tag , Dyachok et al . ( 2008 ) showed that cortical F - actin accumulation in root tip cells was reduced in brk1 mutants ( mutants defective in the expression of one of the SCAR complex subunits , BRK1 ) . This was possibly because the loss of BRK1 affected the function of the SCAR complex in activating the down - stream ARP2 / 3 complex , thereby reducing the number of Development and application of probes for actin cytoskeleton 243 nucleationsitesincells . Inaplant – rhizobiumsystem , Yokotaetal . ( 2009 ) found that two genes , NAP1 and PIR1 , were essential for Mesorhizobium loti to infect and colonize Lotus japonicus roots through disturbing actin cytoskeleton organization . Certain cell types in plants expressing the 35S : : GFP - ABD2 - GFP construct show slight growth defects . Over - expression of GFP - fABD2 - GFP reduced the average length of some root hairs and trichomes by inhibiting cell expansion ( Wang et al . 2007 ) . This may have been because binding of GFP - ABD2 - GFP interferes with the loosening of F - actin networks , which is thought to be required for rapid cell expansion ( Holweg et al . 2004 ) . GFP - ADF tag Although mTalin and fABD2 are still the most commonly used and widely accepted probes to date , several other actin - binding proteins have been used as actin probes . Such proteins include ADF ( Chen et al . 2002 ; Cheung and Wu 2004 ; Wilsen et al . 2006 ; Cheung et al . 2008 ) and some pollen - specific LIM domain proteins ( Thomas et al . 2006 ; Cheung et al . 2008 ) , which have been used as actin probes in pollen tubes . As a depolymerizing ABP of actin , ADF decreases the size of actin cables when it is overexpressed ( Dong et al . 2001 ; Chen et al . 2002 ) . However , since the N - terminal of ADF is important for its actin depolymerization activity , fusion of a GFP at its N terminus compromises its depolymerization activity while preserving its actin - binding activity , thereby making it suitable for use as an actin probe ( Chen et al . 2002 ; Cheung et al . 2008 ) . ADF has been used as an actin marker in research on pollen grains and pollen tubes . The two main pollen - specific ADF components used for probing are from tobacco and lily , named NtADF1 ( Chen et al . 2002 ) and LIADF1 ( Allwood et al . 2002 ) , respectively . Both GFP - NtADF1 and GFP - LIADF1 label the actin cytoskeleton structure , showing long actin cables aligned with the tube axis in the shank and a prominent mesh - or basket - like actin structures at the subapical region of transformed pollen tubes ( Chen et al . 2002 ; Cheung and Wu 2004 ; Wilsen et al . 2006 ; Cheung et al . 2008 ) . That pattern is similar to the actin organization in rapidly frozen and immunolabeled pollen tubes ( Lovy - Wheeler et al . 2005 ) and co - localizes with the phalloidin - labeled actin structure ( Chen et al . 2002 ) . Compared with some other actin probes such as GFP - talin and GFP - fimbrin , GFP - ADFs are the most well tolerated by pollen tubes and seldom result in actin rearrange - ment ( Wilsen et al . 2006 ) . On the other hand , however , GFP - ADFs are more deficient in labeling actin bundles or cables along the shank of pollen tubes than GFP - talin and GFP - fimbrin , except when they are expressed at high levels ( Chen et al . 2002 ; Wilsen et al . 2006 ) . Using GFP - NtADF1 , Cheung and Wu ( 2004 ) reported that overexpression of the Arabidopsis formin AFH1 in pollen tubes induced the formation of supernumerary actin cables from the cell membrane . GFP - LIM tag Recently , the actin - labeling abilities of members of the LIM protein family have been investigated . LIM proteins are characterized by LIM domains — cysteine – histidine - rich , zinc finger - containing domains that are present in a wide variety of eukaryotic proteins and typically mediate protein – protein interactions and subcellular targeting ( Cheung et al . 2008 ; Staiger et al . 2010 ) . A GFP - fused tobacco LIM protein , WLIM1 - GFP , associated prominently with the actin cytoskeleton in BY2 cells and in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells ( Thomas et al . 2006 ) . Because WLIM1 can stabilize the actin cytoskeleton by promoting actin bundling , expression of WLIM1 - GFP in N . benthami - ana leaves induced fewer and thicker actin bundles than in control cells expressing fABD2 - GFP and YFP - mTalin . This result suggested that WLIM1 - GFP may not be an ideal marker due to its induced disorganization of original actin arrays and its inability to label thinner actin structures . Two pollen - specific LIM proteins , LILIM1 and NtPLIM2b , were recently identified from lily ( Wang et al . 2008 ) and tobacco ( Cheung et al . 2008 ) , respectively . Both GFP - LILIM1 and GFP - NtPLM2b can decorate fine axial actin cables in pollen tubes , giving clearer and more elaborate results than those obtained using GFP - ADFs as a label ( Cheung et al . 2008 ) . In the subapical regions of pollen tubes , GFP - NtPLM2b labeled a discernable but subtle subapical actin structure that was more frequently basket - shaped , whereas that labeled with GFP - ADFs was mesh - shaped ( Cheung et al . 2008 ) . GFP - LILIM1 showed better decoration of fine and short filaments in this region compared with mTalin labeling ( Wang et al . 2008 ) . However , overexpressed GFP - LlLIM1 induced novel asterisk - shaped actin aggregates and disturbed vesicle trafficking and oscillatory pollen tube growth , while none of the GFP - NtPLM2b - transformed plants showed noticeable fertility defects , suggesting that pollen tube growth in vivo is quite tolerant of GFP - NtPLM2b ( Wang et al . 2008 ; Cheung et al . 2008 ) . GFP - Lifeact tag Recently , a short peptide named “ Lifeact ” has emerged as a novel and versatile tool for visualizing actin organization in vitro and in vivo ( Riedl et al . 2008 ) . Lifeact comprises the first 17 amino acids of the yeast protein Abp - 140 . To our knowledge , it is the smallest protein tag for actin labeling . The superiority of Lifeact is due to its small size and the lack of homologous sequences in higher organisms ( Riedl et al . 2008 ; Era et al . 2009 ) . The small size of Lifeact presents little competition against major endogenous actin - binding proteins , while the existence of homologous sequences only in close relatives of Saccharomyces cerevisiae makes it an attractive actin marker for higher 244 F . Du , H . Ren eukaryotes . To date , Lifeact is the only protein domain that can be used either in a transformation construct or as a stain to visualize actin . That is , it can be fused with fluorescent proteins and transformed into cells to label actin , or it can be used as a chemical staining marker in vitro , like phalloidin . It has been reported that fine and distinct actin structures could be visualized by using chemically synthe - sized FITC - Lifeact for staining in fixed or living mamma - lian cells ( Li et al . 2008 ; Riedl et al . 2008 ) . As a new actin probe , Lifeact was rapidly adopted by researchers and has been widely used in studies of animal cells ( Li et al . 2008 ; Riedl et al . 2008 ; Renkawitz et al . 2009 ; Kardash et al . 2010 ; Riedl et al . 2010 ) . Lifeact - GFP or other fluorescent proteins present no sign of cytotoxicity , do not affect cell growth , and do not influence normal actin - dependent processes ( Riedl et al . 2008 ; Era et al . 2009 ) . Although it is less commonly used in plants , the results obtained in animal studies suggest that Lifeact could be a useful tool for studying the actin cytoskeleton in a wide range of plant lineages ( Era et al . 2009 ) . Lifeact was used to label a distinct and highly dynamic actin meshwork in various cell types of A . thaliana and some bryophytes . In epidermal cells of A . thaliana , the networks of fine and dense filaments visualized using Lifeact were quite similar to those observed with GFP - ABD2 ( Era et al . 2009 ) . In tip - growing plant cells such as pollen tubes of Lilium formosanum and Nicotiana tobacum , A . thaliana root hairs , and protonemata of the moss P . patens , Lifeact labeled distinct and dynamic actin arrays and consistently revealed a dynamic apical network of F - actin ( Era et al . 2009 ; Vidali et al . 2009 ) . In the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha expressing a Lifeact probe , the branching of actin bundles was clearly observed for the first time in plant cells ( Era et al . 2009 ) . Using GFP - Lifeact for labeling , Deeks et al . ( 2010 ) showed that the plant formin AtFH4 interacted with both microfilaments and microtubules . Except for the report that high expression of Lifeact - mEGFP slightly affected moss protonemal growth ( Vidali et al . 2009 ) , there are no reports of negative effects of Lifeact on morphogenesis and growth of plant cells . It is likely that the small size of Lifeact allows for effective imaging and normal cell growth , even when it is expressed at high levels . Other fluorescent protein - ABPs tags DsRed - ABP tag Since the discovery of GFP , genetic manipulations have generated GFP variants that are better suited than wild - type GFP for fluorescence microscopy or other purposes . These variants include enhanced green fluorescent protein , blue fluorescent protein , cyan fluorescent protein , yellow fluo - rescent protein ( YFP ) , and so on . Red fluorescent proteins ( RFPs ) , which originate from different Anthozoa species , extend the spectrum of fluorescent tags , making multispec - tral imaging very feasible ( Schwartz and Patterson 2003 ; Ivanchenko et al . 2005 ) . These RFPs have been widely adopted as an alternative for GFP in labeling of actin filaments . DsRed or drFP583 , the most commonly used RFP from Discosoma species , shares only 23 % sequence identity with GFP , but the amino acids next to its chromophore are highly conserved . These amino acids may be crucial for chromophore formation ( Matz et al . 1999 ) . DsRed is a photoconvertible fluorescent protein that the GFP chromophore forms initially , and subsequently , the C α – N α bond of the first amino acid in the tripeptide oxidizes , thereby extending the π - conjugated electron system along the backbone and shifting the fluores - cence emission to red ( Nienhaus et al . 2005 ) . In contrast to GFP , DsRed shows an excitation maximum at 558 nm , which does not overlap with that of lignin , a cell wall polymer that hinders GFP detection in the green range ( ∼ 440 to ∼ 540 nm ) , thereby providing a lower cellular autofluorescence back - ground . Moreover , the longer wavelength excitation emitted by DsRed is less cytotoxic , and its fluorescence is much more intense than that of GFP due to its high fluorescent quantum yield . However , DsRed has several limitations , including slow protein maturation and a strong tendency to form tetramers both in vitro and in vivo ( Baird et al . 2000 ; Patterson et al . 2001 ; Ivanchenko et al . 2005 ) . Engineered variants of DsRed have effectively solved the above two problems ( Campbell et al . 2002 ; Yanushevich et al . 2002 ) and have been used to construct markers for labeling of acting filaments . Such variants include DsRed - talin ( Blancaflor 2002 ; Liu et al . 2005 ; Harries et al . 2009 ) and DsRed - ABD2 ( Abied et al . 2006 ) , which have been used in plant pathology studies . In addition to DsRed , there is another important RFP ; the fluorescent protein mCherry . This protein has been used to label cellular organelles such as the ER ( Bracha - Drori et al . 2008 ) , the Golgi ( Müller et al . 2010 ) , and peroxisomes ( Prokhnevsky et al . 2008 ) , and also plant microtubules ( Gutierrez et al . 2009 ) and actin ( Wightman and Turner 2008 ) . By labeling with mCherry - fABD2 , Wightman and Turner ( 2008 ) observed the distribution of actin in develop - ing xylem cells of Arabidopsis . Since mCherry is brighter and shows greater photostability than other RFPs ( Shaner et al . 2005 ) , it may be widely adopted in the future , and could replace DsRed for the labeling of actin in living plant cells . EosFP - ABP tag Recently , other green - to - red photoconvertible fluorescent pro - teins have become available , including EosFP , Kaede , DendFP , mcavRFP , and rfloRFP . In contrast to DsRed , their green - to - red photoconversion is driven by light , rather than chemical Development and application of probes for actin cytoskeleton 245 T a b l e 1 A c ti n c y t o s k e l e t on p r ob e s u s e d i n li v i ng p l a n t ce ll s P r ob e D e s c r i p ti on E xp r e ss i on A dv a n t a g e s D i s a dv a n t a g e s F l uo r e s ce n t ph a ll o i d i n S p ec i f i c d r ug o f ac t i n f il a m e n t s M i c r o i n j ec ti on D ec o r a t e s p r o m i n e n t ac ti n f il a m e n t s a nd bund l e s A lt e r s ac ti n c y t o s k e l e t on dyn a m i c s by s t a b ili za ti on F l uo r e s ce n t ac ti n a n a l og s A b s t r ac t e d ac ti n fr o m p l a n t ti ss u e s M i c r o i n j ec ti on I n c o r po r a t e s i n t o ac ti n c y t o s k e l e t on a s f un c ti on a l c o m pon e n t s C o m p e t e s w it h a nd d i s t u r b s e ndog e nou s ac ti n G FP - ac ti n A c ti n m ono m e r s T r a n s i e n t e xp r e ss i on L a b e l s ac ti n f il a m e n t s i n B Y - 2 ce ll s I nh i b it s t ob acc o po ll e n t ub e g r o w t h G FP - m T a li n ( G FP - m T n ) A c ti n - b i nd i ng do m a i n o f m ou s e t a li n T r a n s i e n t e xp r e ss i on a nd s t a b l e t r a n s f o r m a ti on D ec o r a t e s p r o m i n e n t ac ti n f il a m e n t s a nd bund l e s i n v a r i ou s ce ll t yp e s I ndu ce s r ea rr a ng e m e n t o f ac ti n c y t o s k e l e t on a nd p l a n t g r o w t h i nh i b iti on A t F i m 1 - G FP A r ab i dop s i s f i m b r i n 1 p r o t e i n T r a n s i e n t e xp r e ss i on a nd s t a b l e t r a n s f o r m a ti on D ec o r a t e i n t r i ca t e a nd d yn a m i c c o r ti ca l n e t w o r k s o f ac ti n f il a m e n t s L a b e l s f e w ac ti n f il a m e n t s i n m e r i s t e m ce ll s a nd r oo t h a i r s w it h a d i ff u s e s i gn a l P l a s ti n - G FP C t e r m i nu s o f t r un c a t e d hu m a n T - p l a s ti n p r o t e i n S t a b l e t r a n s f o r m a ti on L a b e l s t h i c k f il a m e n t bund l e s i n r oo t e p i d e r m a l ce ll s P r e s e n t s a d i ff u s e s i gn a l i n r oo t h a i r s G FP - f A B D 2 ( G FP - A B D 2 ) S ec ond ac ti n - b i nd i n g do m a i n o f A r ab i dop s i s f i m b r i n1 T r a n s i e n t e xp r e ss i on a nd s t a b l e t r a n s f o r m a ti on D ec o r a t e s f i n e a nd dyn a m i c ac ti n f il a m e n t s i n n ea r l y a ll ce ll t yp e s S li gh t e ff ec t on m o tilit y o f o r g a n e ll e s a nd t r a n s po r t o f a ux i n i n p l a n t ce ll s G FP - A B D 2 - G F P T w o G FP t a gg e d A B D 2 S t a b l e t r a n s f o r m a ti on E nh a n ce d qu a lit y a nd ea s e o f F - ac ti n i m a g i ng ;

Du , H . Ren oxidation ( Nienhaus et al . 2005 ) . EosFP from the scleractinian coral Lobophyllia hemprichii is a novel fluorescent protein that switches its fluorescence emission from green ( 516 nm ) to red ( 581 nm ) upon irradiation with ≈ 400 nm light . The mechanism of that photoconversion is a switch in structure that changes the green chromophore into the red chromophore . This property enables localized tagging of proteins and thus provides a valuable tool for tracking protein movements within live cells ( Mizuno et al . 2003 ; Wiedenmann et al . 2004 ; Nienhaus et al . 2005 ) . Because the wild - type of EosFP is a tetramer , the relatively smaller EosFP monomer ( mEos ) is used for merging with other proteins . Schenkel et al . ( 2008 ) constructed a fusion gene containing the mEos coding gene and the filament - actin - binding domain of the mammalian talin gene ( mEos : : FABD - mTalin ) . When used to label the actin cytoskeleton in onion epidermal cells , mEos : : FABD - mTalin presented perfect imaging . Moreover , it can stably exist in multicolor - labeled cells and reveal the interaction of actin filaments with other organelles such as peroxisomes . Com - pared with GFP - mTalin and GFP - fABD2 , mEosFP : : FABD - mTalin is potentially the most versatile probe , offering both global and localized color discrimination in a cell through its easy and rapid photoconvertibility . The properties of all actin probes used to date are summarized in Table 1 . Summary and outlook The structure and dynamics of actin in living plant cells are complicated and change over time . Effective probing techniques should reflect these changes sensitively without affecting the process . Although it has several limitations , probing based on microinjection of fluorescent phalloidin or actin analogs can be applied in those plants or plant cells for which transformation technologies have not been established . GFP and other fluorescent proteins provide powerful tools for actin filament labeling and give new insights into the rules of actin distribution and its dynamics in living cells . However , there remains the inevitable problem that whenever we label in vivo , we will always interfere with the biology of the labeled structures . As a central organelle , the actin cytoskeleton interacts with numerous molecules that regulate its dynamics and signaling . Any marker will interfere with those biological processes by occupying the limited binding sites along the actin cytoskeleton . If those binding sites are saturated with markers , they will not bind the factors that regulate actin structure , and therefore , the markers will interfere with the function of the visualized structures . Since we cannot escape this fundamental limitation , we can only try to minimize it by increasing the sensitivity of our observations and by decreasing the expression level of the markers . Although many methods based on fluorescent proteins have been established , it is difficult to demonstrate which one has the best labeling efficiency and universality . Therefore , existing markers should be compared on the basis of their suitability for each cell type and their expression level in live cells . The most informative images of actin structure will be obtained by selecting the most appropriate probe for each cell type and system .
