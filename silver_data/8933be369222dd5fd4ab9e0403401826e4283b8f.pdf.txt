Allen School of Computer Science , University of Washington , USA KATHARINA REINECKE , Paul G . Allen School of Computer Science , University of Washington , USA Our society has been increasingly witnessing a number of negative , unintended consequences of digital technologies . While post - hoc policy regulation is crucial in addressing theseissues , reasonably anticipating theconsequences before deploying technology can help mitigate potential harm to society in the ﬁrst place . Yet , the quest to anticipate potential harms can be diﬃcult without seeing digital technologies deployed in the real world . In this position paper , we argue that anticipating unintended consequences of technology can be facilitated through creativity - enhancing interventions , such as by building on existing knowledge and insights from diverse stakeholders . Using lessons learned from prior work on creativity - support tools , the HCI community is uniquely equipped to design novel systems that aid in anticipating negative unintended consequences of technology on society .

Digital technologies have signiﬁcantly advanced our life quality but have also had many unintended , negative conse - quences on society — outcomes of purposeful actions that are not intended or foreseen at the time of development [ 25 ] . For example , innovations in interaction design have simultaneously exacerbated the disparities between the experi - ences of the demographic groups included or omitted from the research and development process [ 37 ] . Research proto - types that were intended to beneﬁt scientists have been met with strong resistance by other researchers , as the models were unable to distinguish truth from falsehood [ 13 ] . Accessibility features in operating systems have created security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers [ 16 ] . Our recent work has shown that many technologists want to anticipate potential unintended consequences of their research innovations on society but that they lack the know - how and speciﬁc approaches for doing so [ 8 ] . The obser - vation is concerning and somewhat surprising given the increasing discussions of ethics in the news and computer science curricula , as well as proposed changes in the peer review systems including impact statement in HCI and AI [ 1 , 4 , 14 , 36 ] . While requiring comprehensive ethics training is a vital step to make technologists fully aware of the societal implications , achieving this is likely a long - term process that may require years of experience [ 8 ] . We need to support developers to more easily anticipate various outcomes of technology , but reasonably doing so for certain user groups , non - user stakeholders , or society as a whole is a diﬃcult task rife with uncertainties [ 26 ] . To bridge this gap , this paper proposes to enhance related HCI frameworks that account for human values and social impact during design by combining insights from the creativity support tool literature . After all , anticipating Rock Yuren Pang : ypang2 @ cs . washington . edu ; Katharina Reinecke : reinecke @ cs . washington . edu . 2023 . Manuscript submitted to ACM 1 Design x Policy @ CHI ’23 , April 23 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Pang and Reinecke unintended consequences from various perspectives is inherently a creative process . We encourage researchers and policymakers to collaboratively envision methods and tools to anticipate adverse societal eﬀects in this workshop . Prior Work in HCI have proposed frameworks — such as the value sensitive design ( VSD ) [ 10 , 15 ] and design ﬁc - tions [ 5 ] — to guide anticipating potential unintended consequences . VSD starts with the motivation of understanding the technology , human value , or context of use . Then , it identiﬁes direct and indirect stakeholders and the beneﬁts and harms to each stakeholder . Beneﬁts and harms are mapped to the corresponding values , and value conﬂicts are identi - ﬁed . VSD aims to help practitioners ﬁnd alternative approaches that uphold their chosen values while accommodating the same constraints . Another relevant approach for considering unintended consequences is design ﬁction [ 3 , 5 ] , a form of speculative design [ 9 , 19 ] . It envisions new futures including both the technical aspects and the social and polit - ical outcomes of a world with that technology [ 20 ] . To support these approaches in practice , recent toolkits have been developed for designers [ 6 ] , such as the Envisioning Cards [ 11 ] , Metaphor Cards [ 22 ] , and Design Fiction Memos [ 39 ] . They typically oﬀer concrete guidance such as thought - provoking questions ( e . g . , one question in the Envisioning Cards is “what challenges will be encountered by your system if it is used in other countries ? ” ) . While the frameworks and tools guide developers to consider societal implications , they are not without limitations . For example , the toolkits often target practitioners and were used in group sessions [ 12 ] , so applying them to research projects may pose additional challenges . Design ﬁction may suﬀer from exaggeration [ 24 ] and be diﬃcult to evalu - ate [ 3 ] . These approaches to consider societal implications were often assumed to be eﬀective in practice [ 12 ] , but adopting them can be diﬃcult , especially for most developers who are not familiar with these concepts . Using the cur - rent toolsassumed users have suﬃcient knowledge needed to anticipate the consequences . In fact , our recent interview with 20 researchers found that no participant routinely used these frameworks or tools in their own research [ 8 ] . Creativity Support Tools literature , on the other hand , introduced concepts and tools and demonstrated that properly scaﬀolding can galvanize users’ creativity [ 23 ] , thus improving the practicality of an abstract or unfamiliar process . Scaﬀolding refers to structure and guidance to ensure successful completion of a task [ 40 ] , using approaches such as rich examples [ 28 , 35 ] , expert patterns [ 18 ] , instructions [ 30 ] , and templates [ 2 , 31 ] . For example , Siangliulue et al . found that a collection of timely examples can support design ideation [ 35 ] . Sampling diverse inspirational examples and providing a visual overview of the ideas have been shown to improve people’s brainstorming activity [ 34 ] . Similar work on cognition and creativity support conﬁrmed that examples inspire and unveil new ideas most often in the design contexts such as design images and writing feedbacks [ 7 , 17 , 28 , 29 ] . To organize these examples , prior work has used categories of certain topics and characteristics , which were proved essential to human cognition [ 33 , 38 ] , to facilitate exploration of the multitude of examples . For example , IdeaRelate facilitates the exploration of examples in the context of COVID - related topic ideation by tagging them into diﬀerent topics , helping users to include more perspectives in their own idea generation [ 41 ] . To enhance the current frameworks and toolkits , the HCI community can leverage the insights from the creativity literature to design and evaluate future support for technology developers . One concrete direction is to curate exam - ples from past incidents and cluster them in an idea or a solution space to support the generation of relevant ideas for developers , an idea similar to [ 34 ] . These examples can be obtained from online articles [ 27 ] and experts [ 18 ] . An important challenge is to collect insights from a diverse population to avoid missing voices from non - WEIRD com - munities [ 21 , 32 ] . Policymakers can additionally provide speciﬁc policy changes following a previous introduction of technology and establish expert patterns [ 18 ] to consider the societal impact for technologists to follow . We believe that this workshop can enrich the discussion on how to proactively anticipate unintended consequences routinely in the broader research community . 2 Anticipating Unintended Consequences of Technology Using Insights from Creativity Support Tools Design x Policy @ CHI ’23 , April 23 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany REFERENCES [ 1 ] IUI Program Chairs 2022 . 2021 .
