Resultsconﬁrmthatthemaineffectofknowledgediversityonﬁrmgrowth is not signiﬁcant and it indeed plays a role of a moderator . The theory of absorptive capacity provides a good explanation that for ﬁrms with high knowledge diversity , strategic alliances and acquisitions are more effective while for ﬁrms with low knowledge diversity , internal R & D investment is more effective . These ﬁndings point to an important research direct that the char - acteristics of a ﬁrm’s knowledge portfolio play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of knowledge sourcing as well as interﬁrm partnership strategies . Keywords : acquisitions ; alliances ; inter - ﬁrm governance ; knowledge diversity Introduction Today’s networked economy is characterised by complex inter - ﬁrm relationships , which have become a core element in strategy research ( Koka and Prescott 2002 ) . These inter - ﬁrm relation - ships provide ﬁrms with the opportunities to gain access to external resources , complementary skills , knowledge bases and different ways of doing business . Many of the largest companies have more than 20 – 50 % of their assets tied up in a wide range of inter - ﬁrm alliances ( Bamford , Gomes - Casers , and Robinson 2002 ) . Numerous studies have sought to investigate whether and how a wide variety of strategic inter - ﬁrm arrangements affect ﬁrm performance ( e . g . Andrade , Mitchell , and Stafford 2001 ) . The general ﬁndings of those studies suggest that inter - ﬁrm partnerships can increase the variety of a ﬁrm’s knowledge portfolio and its potential for innovation . In this sense , inter - ﬁrm relationships are regarded as valuable resources enabling ﬁrms to increase knowledge ∗ Email : bwlin @ mx . nthu . edu . tw ISSN 0953 - 7325 print / ISSN 1465 - 3990 online © 2011 Taylor & Francis DOI : 10 . 1080 / 09537325 . 2011 . 543334 http : / / www . informaworld . com D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 332 B . - W . Lin diversity and to consolidate in - house competencies . However , investigations on the performance implications of the interrelations between knowledge diversity and inter - ﬁrm relationships are scarce . This paper aims to bridge the research gap in the literature . Firms are no longer self - sufﬁcient in the creation , development and commercialisation of their knowledge assets . Access to external heterogeneous knowledge is important for managerial and innovation performances ( Rodan and Galunic 2004 ) . In the age of technology convergence , inter - disciplinary collaboration becomes a norm of next - generation innovation when compet - ing technologies compete for market dominant designs . Knowledge exchanges among networked ﬁrms allow distinct improvements in the competence of ﬁrms throughout the industry chain . To achieve synergy via shared resources and knowledge is a primary motivation for ﬁrms to strategically make mergers , acquisitions , joint ventures and alliances . Pena ( 2002 ) suggests that a knowledge - based ﬁrm should mix its internal core competencies with inter - ﬁrm extensions to access knowledge beyond the ﬁrm’s boundaries . Firms that emphasise the knowledge diversity dimension have access to a wider range of knowledge bases arising out of diverse inter - ﬁrm relationships . Knowledge diversity Maintaining a portfolio of diversiﬁed knowledge assets can create value for technology ﬁrms ( Lin and Chen 2005 ) . Large technology ﬁrms often have substantial technological competencies out - side their core technology areas ( Patel and Pavitt 2000 ) . Multi - technology ﬁrms have knowledge in excess of what they need for what they make in order to cope with unpredictable product - level interdependencies ( Brusoni , Prencipe , and Pavitt 2001 ) . A diversiﬁed knowledge portfolio can create synergy through economy of scope , boost sales growth and in turn increase the shareholder value . Diversity in knowledge structures enhances the ﬁrm’s potential for innovation by providing an opportunity to make novel linkages and associations ( Cohen and Levinthal 1990 ) . Suzuki and Kodama ( 2004 ) used patent data to show how Japanese technology ﬁrms beneﬁted from tech - nology diversiﬁcation and interactions between multiple technological trajectories . They found that both persistence and diversity of technology could contribute to product diversiﬁcation and sales growth . The knowledge - based view of the ﬁrm would argue that strategy implementation is a process of ﬁtting strategy initiatives as well as knowledge resources so that the ﬁrm’s knowledge assets can be better utilised . A diversiﬁcation strategy should reﬂect the process of branching - out , combination and transformation of a ﬁrm’s existing knowledge bases . Nearly all ﬁrms can develop a wide range of organisational resources and capabilities that can provide them with a competitive advantage . Diversiﬁed ﬁrms have access to the internal and external knowledge resources necessary to build innovation capabilities . A ﬁrm’s knowledge base required to compete in technology markets needs to be more diverse as markets converge and industries collide . Diversity in knowledge structures enhances the ﬁrm’s potential for innovation by providing an opportunity to make novel linkages and associations . Gemba and Kodama ( 2001 ) found that technology diversiﬁcation strategy contributed to ﬁrm proﬁtability . A diversiﬁed knowledge portfolio can create synergy through economies of scope , boosting sales growth and in turn increase the shareholder value . Technologically active ﬁrms invest beyond their distinctive core technological competencies in order to manage and coor - dinate a technical change with their suppliers of components , equipment , and materials . Some researchers ( e . g . Cohen and Levinthal 1990 ) therefore suggested that corporate performance could be signiﬁcantly improved by increasing technology diversity . Technology diversity is a driving D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 Knowledge diversity as a moderator 333 force behind corporate growth , increased R & D investment ; increased external inter - ﬁrm alliances and opportunities to engage in technology - related new businesses . Drawing from the literature on knowledge diversity , the following hypothesis is proposed . H1 : A ﬁrm’s knowledge diversity will be positively associated with its performance . R & D investment In - house R & D clearly contributes to knowledge creation because it is a planned and managed business function designed to systematically extend the ﬁrm - speciﬁc knowledge base , and it also builds the required knowledge infrastructure to identify , assimilate and exploit external knowledge ( Cohen and Levinthal 1990 ) . It is also a prerequisite to convince compatible and capable potential alliance partners to enter mutually beneﬁcial knowledge - exchange relations . Several studies have reported that the announcement of increases in R & D expenditures in high - technology companies was positively and signiﬁcantly related to the increase in share price ( Mank and Nystrom 2001 ) . Other studies have tested and found support for the positive relationship between R & D investment and the ﬁrm’s market value ( Lustgarten and Thomadakis 1987 ) . The following hypothesis is intuitive , based on conventional wisdom for the contribution of new technology development to the ﬁrm performance . H2 : A ﬁrm’s R & D investment will be positively associated with its performance . A large portion of technological innovation occurs through combinations of the existing and new knowledge ( Kogut and Zander 1992 ) . The ability to integrate knowledge both inside and outside the ﬁrm’s boundaries is one of the key success factors in a networked economy . External sources of knowledge are critical for ﬁrms to gain new ideas , insights and expertise , and thereby generate new knowledge innovation . Nicholls - Nixon and Woo ( 2003 ) also suggest that a ﬁrm needs a ‘dual sourcing imperative’ to utilise both internal and external knowledge resources as a means of developing new technological output . Strategic alliances and acquisitions are the two major governance modes that the technology - based ﬁrms use to access external knowledge . The essential element of technological alliances is their involvement in the production and sharing of knowledge . Grant and Baden - Fuller ( 2004 , 61 ) argue that the primary advantage of alliances over both ﬁrms and markets is in accessing rather than acquiring knowledge . In addition to providing access to knowledge for immediate projects , external partnering linkages can provide information and knowledge outside the ﬁrm’s core competence that can be important sources of new product idea ( DeCarolis and Deeds 1999 ) . Asanuma ( 1989 ) therefore used the concept of relation - speciﬁc assets to explain how partnering ﬁrms can develop distinctive routines over time to make a collaborative relationship more effective . However , Bamford and Ernst ( 2002 ) observed that ﬁrms often fail to recognise performance patterns across their alliance portfolios . The portfolio of a ﬁrm’s inter - ﬁrm alliances and col - laborative agreements should be regarded as an integrative whole that supports the corporate strategy . By forming strategic alliances or working partnerships , independent ﬁrms can capture the potential to realise synergy through mutual understanding , knowledge sharing and resource pooling ( Das , Sen , and Sengupta 1998 ) . In this sense , inter - ﬁrm relation networks are quali - ﬁed as strategic ( complementary ) assets that a ﬁrm can incorporate with its existing knowledge base to gain competitive advantage . Dyer and Singh ( 1998 , 660 ) therefore suggest , ‘A ﬁrm’s critical resources may span ﬁrm boundaries and may be embedded in inter - ﬁrm resources and D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 334 B . - W . Lin routines’ . A positive association between alliances and ﬁrm performance has been frequently reported in the strategy literature ( Tehrani 2003 ) . Furthermore , Baum and Oliver ( 1991 ) as well as Mitchell and Singh ( 1996 ) showed that alliances increased organisational survival rates . Powell , Koput , and Smith - Doerr ( 1996 ) also found that ﬁrms with several alliances experienced accelerated growth rates . The general conclusion of the existing research suggests that strategic alliances often have positive effects on corporate performance ( Stuart 2000 ) . Thus we have the following hypothesis . H3 : A ﬁrm’s strategic alliance intensity will be positively associated with its performance . The typical reasons for growth through acquisition are to improve competitive positioning , buy market share , move into related businesses , acquire a management team , obtain a technology , vertically integrate , gain new distribution channels , and redeﬁne a business model . Successful acquirers have done the hard work of debating and developed a highly targeted acquisition growth strategy in advance . Some empirical evidence suggests that corporate diversiﬁcation may not be entirely an agency phenomenon since investors often have a positive response to the announcement of diversiﬁcation programmes . For example , Mowery , Oxley , and Silverman ( 1996 ) found that equity - based alliances and acquisitions were the more effective means of sourcing technological capabilities than contract - based alliances because a higher level of integration could be achieved between partner ﬁrms under an equity alliance . However , the beneﬁts of synergy are often never realised ( Gruca , Nath , and Mehra 1997 ) . Diversiﬁed ﬁrms trade at discounts because of the lack of good use of organisational capabilities in the existing businesses . Synergy can be deﬁned as the interaction of two or more intellectual asset resources from pre - viously separate ﬁrms that creates an enhanced combined effect to value creation and competitive performance , which is greater than the sum of their individual effects ( Gupta and Roos 2001 ) . Knowledge bases are the most valuable intellectual assets for a technology ﬁrm . The acquisition of knowledge and other intangible resources often underscores the acquisition strategies and the intellectual assets are at the root of synergy effects ( Gupta and Roos 2001 ) . Drawing from the above literature , the following hypothesis is proposed . H4 : A ﬁrm’s acquisition intensity will be positively associated with its performance . Knowledge diversity and absorptive capacity Although knowledge diversity has been widely recognised as an important factor to affect per - formance , empirical investigation on the relation between knowledge diversity and performance is still lacking and the results are inconclusive ( e . g . Delios and Beamish 1999 ) . It is possible that knowledge diversity interacts with other variables to yield these diverse results . For example , Hoskisson and Johnson ( 1992 ) found a partial substitution effect between diversiﬁcation strat - egy and R & D intensity . Hitt , Hoskisson , and Kim ( 1997 ) found that knowledge diversiﬁcation could play a moderating role in the relationship between international diversiﬁcation and ﬁrm performance . Firms learn from their previous experience that centrifugal expansion patterns are more suc - cessful than a random strategy . Inter - organisational learning is one of the major reasons for ﬁrms to establish inter - ﬁrm partnerships . The external learning process starts with the identiﬁcation of knowledge created outside the organisation ( Lin 2003 ) . Partnering ﬁrms might provide the knowledge diversity needed for generating new ways of reorganizing the existing knowledge . D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 Knowledge diversity as a moderator 335 To be effective in learning from the partners and the partnering relationships , participating ﬁrms must have an absorptive capacity , the ‘ability to value , assimilate , and utilize new external knowl - edge’ ( Lane and Lubatkin 1998 , 461 ) . From a case study on Toyota’s knowledge sharing networks , Dyer and Nobeoka ( 2000 ) even claimed that inter - ﬁrm networks could be ‘superior to a ﬁrm as an organizational form at creating and recombining knowledge due to the diversity of knowl - edge that resides within a network’ ( p . 345 ) . Inter - ﬁrm partnering allows a ﬁrm to beneﬁt from the creativity , diversity , and agility of its partners . New information technologies further enable extensive inter - ﬁrm communications among experts of diversiﬁed knowledge and in turn facilitate the opportunity for innovation and knowledge integration ( Tenkasi and Boland 1996 ) . Therefore , knowledge diversity is positively related to a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity to assimilate external knowledge . Strategic alliances often offer an alternative to in - house development , by allowing ﬁrms to share risks and costs . Alliance networks are considered as a potential source of learning from partners , promoting efﬁcient skill transfer between partners or producing novel syntheses of existing knowl - edge . Theleveloftechnologicaldiversityispositivelyassociatedwithanalliance’spotentialpayoff assuming that the partners are willing to share knowledge capabilities . In inter - ﬁrm relationships , a ﬁrm with a diversiﬁed knowledge base can have a higher level of ‘absorptive capacity’ since it has the ability to use its prior related knowledge to identify valuable information and innovation opportunity ( Eriksson and Chetty 2003 ) . Firms with an array of inter - ﬁrm relationships may be able to learn and apply technological knowledge to create new products based upon fused tech - nologies integrating diverse external knowledge bases . Opportunities for continual growth would focus on dynamic capabilities that are closely related to the existing capabilities ( Pettus 2002 ) . According to Steensma and Corley ( 2000 ) , the beneﬁts of strategic alliances depend upon the tightness of the collaboration . In addition , the type and the extent of association between engage - ment in strategic alliances and performance can be moderated by variables such as knowledge diversity . We therefore suspect that knowledge diversity can play a moderating role in the relation - ships between ﬁrm performance and other independent variables , that is , acquisition orientation , strategic alliance intensity and R & D investment . H5 : The contribution of strategic alliances on ﬁrm performance will be stronger when the ﬁrm’s knowledge diversity is high . The emphasis on mergers and acquisitions should shift the focus from market expansion to access - ing resources that are embedded in target ﬁrms . Knowledge - based assets are not easily imitable owing to barriers of knowledge transfer and communication . Therefore , acquiring ﬁrms may not easily assimilate or duplicate knowledge - based resources of the acquired , because they are vague and ambiguous . High - tech acquisitions are likely to succeed when the acquirer and target have common knowledge base and belong to the same industry sector ( Kennedy , Payne and Whitehead 2002 ) . Work teams of diversiﬁed backgrounds have a higher capability of external knowledge sharing ( Cummings 2004 ) . Firms that have prior relevant experience and knowledge are better able to acquire and assimilate new knowledge . Knowledge diversity can facilitate creation and transfer of technological knowledge by solving inter - organisational problems of communication barriers ( Lapré and Van Wassenhove 2001 ) . H6 : The contribution of mergers and acquisitions on ﬁrm performance will be stronger when the ﬁrm’s knowledge diversity is high . D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 336 B . - W . Lin Diverse knowledge base provides ﬁrms with a variety of instrumental , normative and procedu - ral knowledge to capture innovation opportunities . Knowledge diversity is a critical factor in creating and transferring knowledge ( Lapré and Van Wassenhove 2003 ) . The greater the diver - sity of competency or knowledge , the greater is the likelihood that radical innovations will emerge out of a ﬁrm’s R & D investment ( Hage and Hollingsworth 2000 ) . Although tradeoffs are involved in the internal and external learning processes ( Bierly and Chakrabarti 1996 ) , both internal and external learning processes constitute an integrated whole of an organisa - tional learning process . Suzuki and Kodama ( 2004 ) therefore advocated that the innovative opportunities of Schumpeterian widening patterns of innovation that a ﬁrm’s performance was positively associated with its technology diversiﬁcation . Therefore , the following hypothesis is proposed . H7 : The contribution of R & D investment on ﬁrm performance will be stronger when the ﬁrm’s knowledge diversity is high . Research methods In order to test the interaction effects of knowledge diversity , a large sample size of ﬁrm - year data is required . The sample used in this study consists of US - based manufacturing ﬁrms in two - digit standard industrial classiﬁcation ( SIC ) codes 35 ( Industrial and commercial machinery manufacturers ) , 36 ( Electronic and other electrical equipment manufacturers ) , 37 ( Transporta - tion equipment ) and 38 ( Measuring and analysing instruments manufacturers ) . Intensive R & D investment and technology superiority are the sources of competitive advantages for ﬁrms in those industries . In the age of technology convergence , inclusion of a wide range of industries can increase the robustness and generalisibility of our research results . Because of the constraints of data availability , our sample was composed of ﬁrm - year data of publicly traded ﬁrms that received more than ﬁve patents from the US Patent and Trade - mark Ofﬁce during the previous three years . The ﬁnancial information on those ﬁrms was taken directly from the Compustat Research Insight database . The Compustat database was compiled by Standard & Poor’s and included accounting and ﬁnancial data for over 6000 public ﬁrms that have their shares traded on the New York , American , NASDAQ and other over - the - counter stock exchanges . Wethengatheredtheinter - ﬁrmstrategiesofthoseﬁrmsbasedoninformationfromtheSecurities Data Corporation ( SDC ) databases including all mergers and acquisitions ( M & A ) and strategic alliances announced during the period from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 2003 . The SDC Platinum database is based on announcements from various business publications including the Wall Street Journal , Business Week , Mergers and Acquisitions , the New York Times , and Dow Jones . Annual Reports and administrative surveys are also the sources of SDC Platinum data . The database maintains a complete list of ﬁrms’ M & A and alliances beginning in 1988 and has been widely used in previous strategy studies ( e . g . Dutta and Weiss 1997 ; Kale , Dyer , and Singh 2002 ) . A three - year observation window was used to calculate a focal ﬁrm’s inter - ﬁrm strategies . This three - year window was used to capture the variation across years because the amount of strategic initiatives in one year may not represent the long - term strategic intent of the focal ﬁrm . The NBER Patent Citation Data File ( Hall , Jaffe , and Tratjenberg 2001 ) is a research database of the US patents granted from 1969 to 1999 , including the complete information from the front pages of all patents issued by the US Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce . Incorporating patent information provided by the data ﬁle , Microsoft Access has been used as a research tool and the D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 Knowledge diversity as a moderator 337 ﬁrms’ Committee on Uniform Security Identiﬁcation Procedures ( CUSIP ) numbers to integrate massive amount of data from different sources ( NBER , Compustat and SDC ) . The NBER Patent Citation Data File is extended by using the same data format to include US patent data from 2000 to 2003 . In the resulting data set , sample ﬁrms in a three - year time period had a number of strategic alliances ranging from 0 to 175 with a mean of 4 . 88 . The total value of acquisitions in a three - year period ranged from 0 to US $ 57 . 792 billion worth a mean value of US $ 616 million . Owing to missing data in the Compustat database , the ﬁnal data set included only 2404 ﬁrm - year data points that were used for subsequent generalised linear model analysis and hypothesis testing . Dependent variables : earnings and sales growth The main objective of this study is to understand how knowledge diversity can contribute to ﬁrm growth and proﬁtability . I employed two ﬁrm performance measures : sales growth ( Subba - Narasimha , Ahmad , and Mallya 2003 ) and net earnings . Sales growth is measured as the focal ﬁrm’s sales minus its average sales in the previous period ( three years ) . The other performance index , net earnings , is deﬁned as gross sales minus taxes , interest , depreciation and other expenses , and can be taken directly from the Compustat database . Since the pursuit of earnings is the primary reason that the companies exist , this measure is considered as one of the most important measures of a ﬁrm’s performance . Control variables Several control variables were used to reduce possible variances since we drew sample ﬁrms of different sizes across different industries . The general environmental conditions for our sample ﬁrms could be very different every year . There is a widespread perception that the business world is getting more dynamic and complex over time . A categorical variable , year , was used to account for possible variances caused by the changes of yearly economic conditions . Since the sample data started from 1994 and ended in 2003 , the ﬁx effect variable has 10 levels , Y1994 through Y2003 . Another categorical variable , SIC , was introduced to control possible industry - speciﬁc variances that caused general environmental conditions in four different two - digit SIC industries , SIC35 through SIC38 . Since the two - digit SIC industry classiﬁcation might be too broad to account for the diversity of industry characteristics that the sample ﬁrms were facing . Environment dimensions such as muniﬁcence , dynamism and complexity had changed over time ( Castrogiovanni2002 ) . Atthefour - digitSICindustrylevel , threefrequentlyusedindustrystructure variables were further introduced : industry growth ( muniﬁcence ) , volatility ( dynamism ) and four - ﬁrm concentration . Industry growth was proxied by the annual growth rate of four - digit SIC industry and volatility was proxied by the sum of squared market share changes across ﬁrms in the same four - digit SIC industry . The four - ﬁrm concentration ratio is the aggregrate market share of top four market leaders . An organisation’s ability to cope with industry environment is a key determinant of its performance ( Anderson and Tushman 2001 ) . The relationship between ﬁrm size and innovation capability has long been a debated issue in the strategy literature ( see Freeman and Soete 1997 ) . Most empirical studies of ﬁrm performance include ﬁrm size as a control variable or an independent variable . This tradition has been followed and used the total assets ( in US $ millions ) as a control for ﬁrm size effect . Since the focus of this study is to investigate the effects of absorptive capacity during a three - year period , initial net sales at year t – 3 should be controlled while ﬁrm performance at year t is considered . D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 338 B . - W . Lin Independent variables In this study , a ﬁrm’s R & D expense ( in US $ millions ) is used to measure R & D investment , which represents a ﬁrm’s internal knowledge sourcing orientation ( e . g . Abdullah , Guo , and Mande 2002 ) . Strategic alliance intensity in this study is measured as the number of strategic alliances announced during a three - year period . Acquisition orientation is measured as the total deal value ( dollar amount in US $ millions ) of acquisitions announced during the previous three - year period . Knowledge diversity ( KD ) measures the degree to which a ﬁrm has built a diversiﬁed repertoire of its portfolio of technological knowledge in 36 technological sub - categories as deﬁned by the NBER database . This KD measure adopts the transformed Herﬁndahl - type index , which is widely used in the diversiﬁcation literature to measure the level of diversiﬁcation across industry categories . We calculated the number of patents in a ﬁrm’s patent portfolio that belong to the 36 technology sub - categories ( X i , i = 1 to 36 ) . KD = 1 − (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) 36 (cid:6) i = 1 (cid:7) X i (cid:8) X i (cid:9) 2 (cid:10) The generalised linear model techniques have been employed to test the hypotheses regarding the effects of technology innovativeness and corporate strategy portfolio on ﬁrm performance . Results The generalised linear model ( GLM ) in SAS 9 . 1 was used to analyse the quasi - panel data . Four GLM Models in Table 1 show the results that the proposed hypotheses were mostly accepted . Earnings and sales growth are the two dependent variables for model 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 , respectively . Models 1 and 2 present no signiﬁcant differences in earnings among different sample years except for year 2000 booming . Productivity growth , as shown in models 3 and 4 , increased over time . Firms in SIC 37 had experienced a higher sales growth during the sample years . Firms in a muniﬁcent industry were likely to have high earnings and sales growth rates . The coefﬁcients of volatility across four GLM models were all negative suggesting that ﬁrms in volatile industries had low earnings and sales growth rates . The coefﬁcients of four - ﬁrm concentration of the four GLM models were negative indicating that ﬁrms in concentrated industries can enjoy excess earnings since competition in concentrated industries are low . Firms in concentrated industries also had high sales growth rates . The results of the above three four - digit industry control variables were consistent with previous ﬁndings ( e . g . Castrogiovanni 2002 ) . The ﬁrm size effect indicated in the four GLM Models suggesting that larger ﬁrms tend to have higher earnings and sales growth rates . Larger ﬁrms have more resources and competitive advantages of scale economy . However , if the focal ﬁrm had high initial sales suggesting that it performed very well during the last period , the relatively high standard was difﬁcult to overpass . Therefore , earnings and sales growth rates were negatively associated with initial sales as shown in Table 1 . Hypothesis 1 predicts that a ﬁrm’s knowledge diversity will be positively associated with its growth potential . However , the results of models 1 and 3 did not support this hypothesis . This may be due to the fact that the knowledge in fact is a moderator to affect ﬁrm growth . The direct effect of knowledge diversity is not signiﬁcant implying that a ﬁrm can choose to have either a diversiﬁed knowledge portfolio or a focused one and still be successful .

However , the relationship between R & D investment and sales growth was negative as shown in model 3 . Hypothesis 3 predicts a positive association between alliance intensity and ﬁrm performance . Results of models 1 , 3 and 4 strongly support this hypothesis . The coefﬁcients of alliance intensity in model 1 and 3 were 4 . 42 ( t = 4 . 93 ) and 45 . 99 ( t = 15 . 33 ) , indicating that strategic alliances are beneﬁcial to earnings and sales growth . Hypothesis 4 predicts that mergers and acquisitions are positively related to ﬁrm performance , and the results of models 3 and 4 support this hypothesis . The regression coefﬁcient of M & A deal value in model 3 is 0 . 041 ( t = 2 . 82 ) , indicating that acqui - sition orientation contributes to sales growth . Sales will generally increase when a ﬁrm acquires other ﬁrms and becomes larger . However , the coefﬁcients of acquisition orientation in models 1 and 2 suggesting that ﬁrms may pay premiums for M & A that can be detrimental to proﬁtability . Hypotheses 5 and 6 were conﬁrmed that the interaction effects between knowledge diversity and strategic alliances and acquisition orientation were signiﬁcantly positive as shown in models 1 and 3 . Knowledgediversitypositivelymoderatestheeffectsofstrategicalliancesandacquisitionorien - tation on ﬁrm earnings as well as sales growth . This means that strategic alliances and acquisition orientation had larger contribution to ﬁrm performance when the focal ﬁrm has higher knowledge diversity . In order to effectively leverage externally created knowledge and resources , a ﬁrm should have a diversiﬁed knowledge base so that it can have more opportunities for partner selection , inter - organisational learning , technology fusion , knowledge integration and resource complemen - tarity . The last hypothesis was not supported by models 2 and 4 that the interaction effect between knowledge diversity and R & D investment was not positive as predicted . The coefﬁcient of the interaction term in model 2 even had a negative sign . This negative moderating effect is not very surprising . The capability - based view ( e . g . Barney 1991 ; Joseph and Pandian 1992 ) suggests that ﬁrms should focus on their core competence and concentrate only on technology ﬁelds that they can do best . Technology - based ﬁrms should deepen their technological knowledge in a small number of technology ﬁelds and by doing so synergy occurs because they can pre - empt potential entrants to those technology ﬁelds by constructing patent mineﬁelds to protect their core compe - tences . Therefore , R & D investment on core technology areas is more effective than on diversiﬁed technology areas . The empirical data seem to support the capability - based view of the ﬁrm . Conclusion This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of the relationships between knowledge diver - sity and interﬁrm relationships from an absorptive capacity perspective . Several authors have seen knowledge diversity as an antecedent of the likelihood of internal and external strategic initiatives . Recent empirical work has extended the range of strategies linked to a ﬁrm’s internal resources . Jordan , Lowe , and Taylor ( 1998 ) as well as O’Brien ( 2003 ) investigated the relationship between capital structure and a variant of Porter’s generic strategy typology . This paper contributes to this ﬁeld of investigation by considering knowledge diversity as a moderator between the relations between inter - ﬁrm relationships and ﬁrm performance . The results of our analysis point to several noteworthy ﬁndings . First , the main effect of knowl - edge diversity on ﬁrm performance is not signiﬁcant and it indeed is a moderator that interacts with other variables : R & D investment , strategic alliance intensity and acquisition orientation . This paper answers the need for research to identify the dimensions of knowledge assets and such dimensions have an important inﬂuence on ﬁrm strategy and performance ( Birkinshaw , Nobel , and Ridderstrale 2002 ) . In line with our ﬁnding , SubbaNarasimha ( 2001 ) found that depth and breadth ( diversity ) of knowledge had main and interaction effects on ﬁrm performance . D o w n l o a d e d by [ L a u r e n ti a n U n i v e r s it y ] a t 14 : 15 03 O c t ob e r 2013 Knowledge diversity as a moderator 341 Second , for ﬁrms with high knowledge diversity , strategic alliances and acquisitions seem to be more effective . On the contrary , for ﬁrms with low knowledge diversity , alliances and acquisitions seem not to improve ﬁrm performance . That is , the results conﬁrmed the theory of absorptive capacity that a ﬁrm’s knowledge diversity may be an important factor determining the appropriate interﬁrm relationships . Third , the data sample of this paper conﬁrms the positive and signiﬁcant effects of strategic alliances to ﬁrm growth . Several recent studies ( e . g . Doz 1996 ; Powell , Koput , and Smith - Doerr 1996 ; Steensma and Corley 2000 ; Tehrani 2003 ) indicate that strategic alliances are increasingly employed by ﬁrms to decrease their resource dependency on a single counterpart . Through alliances , ﬁrms enhance access to new markets and new technologies with lower cash outlay , deal more effectively with environmental uncertainty , and gain more access and control over scarce resources . Tehrani ( 2003 ) conducted an extensive literature review and found similar results in that the relationship between strategic alliances and performance varies from signiﬁcant positive impact , being moderated by intervening variables , indicating no relationship . Fourth , two ﬁrm performance measures were used as dependent variables to represent different perspectives on measuring how well a ﬁrm achieves its strategic goals . Since the empirical results are quite consistent , the robustness of our ﬁndings is clear . Finally , R & D investment interacts with knowledge diversity to affect ﬁrm performance . This conﬁrms the capability - based view of the ﬁrm that a ﬁrm beneﬁts more from internal R & D when it has a focused knowledge portfolio while a knowledge diversiﬁed ﬁrm can better utilise external knowledge and resources . The ﬁndings of this study should also apply to other industries and other countries . Nevertheless , one can expect the results reported here to be less apparent in those industries where patents are not the dominant intellectual assets . Those results are limited in that ﬁrms in our sample can have distinct ﬁrm - speciﬁc and environmental characteristics , even though the ﬁrm size and year dummies were used as control variables . This study did not measure intangibles other than patents , such as brand equity , information technology capabilities and technological know - how . It did not measure the speciﬁc characteristics and motivations of each strategic initiative . Therefore , further research on the ways in which ﬁrm - speciﬁc characteristics and the interﬁrm environment shape the ﬁrm’s knowledge portfolio and strategy portfolio would be useful . Future research could also investigate interactions among variables of a ﬁrm’s strategy portfolio and its strategy portfolio . There may be also some interaction effects among both counting variables and timing variables of strategic initiatives . For example , Knickerbocker ( 1973 ) suggested that the rate of interﬁrm initiatives is higher when more customers and fewer competitors enter a market . Finally , future research could assess the performance implications of strategic initiatives while controlling for inﬂuences on other characteristics of its knowledge portfolio .
