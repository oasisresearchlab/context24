Maintenance ofnephrin within this unique cell junction has been proposed to require dynamic phosphorylation events and endocytic recycling , although the molecular mechanisms that control this interplay are poorly understood . Here , we investigated the possibility that the phosphotyrosine adaptor protein ShcA regulates nephrin turnover . Western blotting and immunostaining analysis con ﬁ rmed that ShcA is expressed in podocytes . In immu - noprecipitation and pulldown assays , ShcA , via its SH2 domain , was associated with several phosphory - lated tyrosine residues on nephrin . Overexpression of ShcA promoted nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced nephrin signaling and cell surface expression in vitro . In a rat model of reversible podocyte injury and proteinuria , phosphorylated nephrin temporally colocalized with endocytic structures coinci - dent with upregulation of ShcA expression . In vivo biotinylation assays con ﬁ rmed that nephrin expression decreased at the cell surface and correspondingly increased in the cytosol during the injury time course . Finally , immunostaining in kidney biopsy specimens demonstrated overexpression of ShcA in several human proteinuric kidney diseases compared with normal conditions . Our results suggest that increases in ShcA perturb nephrin phosphosignaling dynamics , leading to aberrant nephrin turnover and slit dia - phragm disassembly .

Here , werevealtheadaptorproteinShcAasanovelsignaling molecule within the slit diaphragm . Shc family adaptors ( ShcA - D ) contain both a phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) do - main and a C - terminal SH2 domain , each of which can bind phosphotyrosine residues ( Figure 1A ) . 11 The central CH1 re - gion contains three phosphorylatable tyrosine residues , in ad - dition to a motif that binds a - adaptin , a component of the clathrin assembly complex . Splicing and alternative transla - tion start sites produce the 46 , 52 , and 66 kDa isoforms of ShcA . 12 The p46 and p52 isoforms are well established activa - tors of the Ras / MAPK pathway via their recruitment of Grb2 to the central tyrosines , and they also promote clathrin - mediated endocytosis of the EGF receptor through the a - adaptin – binding motif . 13 The p66 isoform uniquely con - trols the oxidative stress response through its extended CH2 region . 14 Global knockout of all ShcA isoforms in mice causes major cardiovascular abnormalities , resulting in embryonic lethality , and ShcA - de ﬁ cient ﬁ broblasts exhibit defects in ac - tin organization . 15 In the kidney , deletion of p66 renders proximal tubule cells more resistant to oxidative stress , 16 and it also suppresses hyperglycemia - induced glomerular injury 17 ; however , the in vivo role of ShcA in podocytes has not yet been explored . We now report that ShcA interacts via its SH2 domain with phosphorylated nephrin to regulate nephrin tyrosine phos - phorylation and surface expression . We further demonstrate that ShcA is upregulated in a reversible podocyte injury model coincident with relocalization of phosphorylated nephrin into endocytic structures , and that nephrin is removed from the cell surface in this model . Finally , we show increased expression of ShcA in humans with proteinuric kidney dis - ease . We conclude that ShcA is a central regulator of nephrin phosphosignaling dynamics , which in turn , modulates ﬁ ltra - tion barrier function via direct control of nephrin turnover at the plasma membrane . RESULTS ShcA Is Expressed in Podocytes and Interacts with Nephrin via its SH2 Domain ShcA is among a select few SH2 domain - containing proteins predicted by DomPep modeling 18 to interact with phosphor - ylated nephrin ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . As ShcA is widely expressed , we ﬁ rst established the presence of this adaptor protein in podocytes via Western immunoblot analysis of pro - tein lysates obtained from cultured podocytes and neonatal and adult mouse kidney cortex . All ShcA isoforms are found within podocytes , and their expression declines once glomer - ulogenesis is complete , with the p46 / 52 isoforms predominat - ing over the p66 isoform in both the immature and mature kidney ( Figure 1B ) . We also performed immunostaining of mouse kidney cryosections , where ShcA was distributed throughout the glomerulus and robustly localized with neph - rin in podocytes ( Figure 1C ) . To next investigate whether ShcA interacts with nephrin , Flag - tagged p46 / 52 ShcA was coexpressed with Myc - tagged , full - length nephrin in HEK293T cells . Nephrin coprecipitated with ShcA , and this effect was enhanced upon coexpression of constitutively ac - tive Fyn , but not a kinase dead variant of this SFK ( Figure 1D ) , indicating a requirement for nephrin tyrosine phosphoryla - tion in the nephrin - ShcA interaction . We con ﬁ rmed that p66 ShcA could similarly associate with phosphorylated nephrin ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) . ShcA contains both PTB and SH2 domains , thus we next wanted to determine which phosphotyrosine - binding module might mediate interaction with nephrin . Pulldown assays of nephrin in the presence or absence of constitutively active Fyn , using glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fused to each domain , revealed that the SH2 domain but not the PTB domain is required for nephrin binding , and mutation of the phosphotyrosine - binding pocket of the SH2 domain ( R397K , SH2 * ) disrupted this interaction ( Figure 1E ) .

To identify which residues might mediate the interaction with ShcA , a spot peptide array harboring phosphorylated ( pY ) and nonphosphoryla - ted ( Y ) tyrosine - based sequences from each species was in - cubated with puri ﬁ ed GST - SH2 domain of ShcA . The SH2 domain bound consistently to phosphorylated Y1114 , Y1176 , Y1193 , and Y1217 ( human numbering system ) , and not the J Am Soc Nephrol 29 : 92 – 103 , 2018 ShcA Regulates Nephrin Endocytosis 93 www . jasn . org BASIC RESEARCH nonphosphorylated peptide counterparts ( Figure 2B ) . To val - idate this binding in the context of full - length nephrin , we performed pulldown assays of the ShcA GST - SH2 domain with nephrin variants bearing single or multiple tyrosine ( Y ) to phenylalanine ( F ) mutations at these sites . The Y1193F and Y1217F mutations had the greatest reduction on ShcA binding compared with wild type ( WT ) , whereas Y1114F surprisingly had no effect ( Figure 2C ) . Compound mutation of Y1176F , Y1193F , and Y1217F ( referred to as Y3F mutation ) completely abolished interaction with ShcA ( Figure 2C ) . Lastly , we con ﬁ rmed the speci ﬁ city of ShcA binding to nephrin in vivo in mouse glomerular lysates , and determined that this interaction was disrupted in mice bearing the nephrin - Y3F mutation ( Figure 2D ) . Altogether , these ﬁ ndings demon - strate that the ShcA adaptor interacts via its SH2 domain with multiple tyrosine phosphorylated sites on nephrin . ShcA Enhances Src - Dependent Nephrin Phosphorylation and Promotes Nephrin Endocytosis We next sought to determine the func - tional consequences of the nephrin - ShcA interaction on downstream signaling . Flag - tagged p46 / 52 ShcA was coexpressed with nephrin in HEK293T cells , and phos - phorylation of several cellular targets was monitored . Intriguingly , nephrin ty - rosine phosphorylation on Y1193 and Y1217 was enhanced in the presence of WT ShcA , and this effect was not seen with the ShcA SH2 * mutation , which can - not bind nephrin ( Figure 3 , A – C ) . The in - crease in nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by an increase in SFK activation ( Figure 3 , A and D ) . Of note , however , phosphorylation of ShcA as well as Akt downstream of nephrin remained unchanged ( Figure 3A ) . We con ﬁ rmed this effect on nephrin hyperphosphoryla - tion within our documented inducible set - ting of nephrin activation , 19 where ShcA was coexpressed with CD16 - nephrin - GFP , and cells were stimulated with CD16 to promote nephrin clustering , phosphorylation , and ShcA recruitment ( Figure 3E , Supplemental Figure 1B ) . In - clusion of the SFK inhibitor PP2 but not vehicle ( DMSO ) alone suppressed the ShcA - mediated increase in nephrin tyro - sine phosphorylation ( Figure 3E ) . Nephrin signaling converges on the AP - 1 transcrip - tion factor , 8 , 20 thus we investigated whether coexpression of ShcA with nephrin could affect nephrin - mediated AP - 1 transactivation using a previously established luciferase re - porter assay . We found that WT ShcA signi ﬁ cantly sup - pressed AP - 1 activity compared with cells without excess ShcA , and this effect was abrogated with the ShcA SH2 * mu - tation ( Figure 3F ) . Further , the effect of WT ShcA was com - parable to that of b - arrestin ( Figure 3F ) , which has been Figure 1 . ShcA is expressed in podocytes and binds tyrosine phosphorylated nephrin .

We conclude that Fyn - mediated hyperphos - phorylation of nephrin induced by high levels of ShcA promotes nephrin endocytosis , and thereby suppresses nephrin signaling . ShcA Is Upregulated during PAN Nephrosis Coincident with Redistribution of Tyrosine Phosphorylated Nephrin into Early Endosomes We and others have previously demon - strated that nephrin tyrosine phosphor - ylation is perturbed in the puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) nephrosis rodent model of human minimal change disease ( MCD ) , 21 , 22 thus we next examined whether expression of ShcA might also be altered during the injury time course . Glo - merular extracts were prepared from PBS - injected control rats and PAN - injected rats at the onset ( day 4 ) and peak ( days 7 and 14 ) of proteinuria ( Supplemental Figure 2A ) . Immunoblotting for ShcA revealed a rise in p46 / 52 ShcA expression , which reached a maximum on days 7 and 14 ( Figure 4 , A and B ) . Upregulation of ShcA was similarly seen in PAN - treated cultured podocytes ( Figure 4 , C and D ) . Intrigu - ingly , the increase in ShcA expression in vivo correlated with a modest rise in nephrin phosphorylation on Y1193 and Y1217 at later points during the time course , after the decrease ( in Y1217 ) ob - served on day 4 ( Figure 4A ) . Immunos - taining of glomeruli on day 7 revealed a change in phospho - nephrin distribution compared with the control , appearing fo - cal and punctate during injury , with areas of intense staining showing colocalization with the early endosome marker EEA1 ( Figure 4E ) . Podocin and EEA1 colocaliza - tion was also enhanced at this time point ( Supplemental Figure 2B ) . Nephrin Is Mislocalized from the Membrane to the Cytosol in Response to Podocyte Injury To further explore the nature of nephrin redistribution during PAN injury , we utilized super - resolution structured illumi - nation microscopy to image nephrin - immunostained kidney sections prepared from PAN - injected rats and controls . Continuous linear stain - ing of nephrin can be observed along the capillary wall in control animals , whereas PAN injection leads to a punctate appearance , suggesting cytosolic accumulation of nephrin with injury ( Figure 5A ) . To investigate this in more detail , we performed biotinylation assays on intact glomeruli isolated from PAN - injected rats and controls , followed by immuno - blotting of enriched and lysate fractions to monitor changes Figure 2 .

Quanti ﬁ ed strep - tavidin precipitation reveals a signi ﬁ cant steady decrease in nephrin surface expression during the injury time course ( Figure 5 , B and C ) , and a corresponding increase in cytosolic nephrin can be seen in the remaining supernatant ( Figure 5B ) . This redistribution from the membrane to the cytoplasm correlates with the rise in ShcA expression shown in Figure 4 . A transient decline in podocin surface expression was also observed ( Supplemental Figure 2 , C and D ) , consistent with previous ﬁ ndings , 23 and no surface labeling of the podocyte nuclear / cytosolic WT - 1 protein was detected , verifying the speci ﬁ city of this approach ( Supplemental Figure 2E ) . To - gether , these results support the hypothesis that upregulation of ShcA triggers nephrin endocytosis and ﬁ ltration barrier demise . ShcA Is Overexpressed in Human Glomerulopathies Associated with Proteinuria To determine whether the increase in ShcA expression within the rodent model of podocyte injury might be similarly ob - served in human glomerulopathies , we performed dual immu - nostaining of ShcAand nephrin on biopsies from patients with MCD or FSGS , or healthy donor controls ( Figure 6 ) . In healthy adult controls , ShcA is expressed at low levels , similar to our ﬁ ndings in mature versus neonatal mice ( Figure 1B ) . However , a striking increase in ShcA was reproducibly observed in both patients with MCD and patients with FSGS , wherein it dis - played robust colocalization with nephrin . Analysis of the open - source Nephroseq database ( nephroseq . org ) similarly shows upregulation of ShcA expression in FSGS and MCD , in addition to IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) ( Table 1 ) . Of note , ShcA is among the top 2 % – 4 % of overexpressed glomerular genes in several of the data sets analyzed . These ﬁ ndings strongly imply that aberrant ShcA signaling is induced in human proteinuric glomerular diseases . DISCUSSION Here , we have identi ﬁ ed the ShcA adaptor protein as a putative novel regulator of nephrin surface expression and ﬁ ltration barrier integrity . ShcAassociates with tyrosine phosphorylated nephrin , and in the mature glomerulus , we propose that low levels of ShcA signaling contribute to a steady - state pool of phosphorylated nephrin within the slit diaphragm and aid in nephrin recycling . On injury , ShcA expression increases , triggering a pathogenic positive feedback loop of nephrin hy - perphosphorylation and enhanced endocytosis . Concurrent loss of nephrin and podocin from the podocyte surface desta - bilizes the slit diaphragm , leading to proteinuria . ShcA signal - ing provides amechanism to controlturnoverandstabilization of this dynamic cell junction . Shc proteins possess a unique domain architecture that allows them to simultaneously engage multiple signaling pathways . 11 The PTB domain is the most common mediator of these interactions ; however , we have determined that re - cruitment of ShcA to phosphorylated nephrin is via its SH2 domain . The ShcA SH2 domain - binding consensus is pY - w - X - w 24 , which is in line with sequences surrounding nephrin Y1176 , Y1193 , and Y1217 . Notably , these tyrosines were pre - dicted by the DomPep method 18 to bind the ShcA SH2 domain ( Supplemental Table 1 ) , and ShcA was previously reported as an interaction partner of recombinant phospho - nephrin . 25 The function of the ShcA PTB domain in podo - cytes remains to be determined , although an intriguing target is IQGAP1 , 26 which can indirectly bind nephrin and regulate podocyte actin dynamics . 27 Alternately , the ShcA PTB domain can bind acidic phospholipids , which may sta - bilize ShcA localization at the slit diaphragm . 28 , 29 The central Grb2 - binding phosphotyrosine residues on ShcA appear to be dispensable in nephrin signaling , consistent with reports that Grb2 does not bind nephrin and is not required for podocyte function . 30 , 31 These ﬁ ndings also support a non - canonical role for ShcA in nephrin signaling through addi - tional elements , such as the AP - 2 a - adaptin – binding motif . Accordingly , our studies have revealed that ShcA promotes neph - rin phosphorylation in a Fyn - mediated fashion , leading to neph - rin endocytosis . ShcA may enhance activation of Src or Fyn directly 32 orindirectly via itsinteractionwiththeShp2phosphatase , which in turn activates Fyn . 33 Of note , Shp2 overexpression was recently shown to enhance nephrin phosphorylation , and similar to ShcA , Shp2 is overexpressed in a subset of human glomerular diseases . 34 Binding of ShcA to multiple phosphorylated tyrosine res - idues on nephrin appears to overlap with that of Nck , 19 and both of these proteins can promote nephrin hyperphosphor - ylation . 35 However , the downstream consequences of nephrin hyperphosphorylation are distinct between ShcA and Nck , 35 and these ﬁ ndings implicate dual roles for nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation in healthy versus injured podocytes . ShcA and Nck can both associate with Y1176 , Y1193 , and Y1217 ; however , ShcA shows preferential binding to Y1193 and Nck has the highest af ﬁ nity for Y1217 . 19 We have recently estab - lished that phosphorylation on these tyrosine residues is transiently coexpressing ShcA - Flag or b - arrestin with Myc - nephrin , podocin , AP1 - ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase , and renilla luciferase were subject to a dual reporter assay . ShcA WT but not SH2 * suppressed the nephrin / podocin - induced activation of AP - 1 , similar to b - arrestin ( n = 4 ) . ( G ) HEK293T cells transiently coexpressing WT or SH2 * ShcA - Flag with Myc - nephrin were subject to surface biotinylation . Densitometric comparison of streptavidin - precipitated biotinylated nephrin ( surface ) to total nephrin ( input ) indicates a reduction in surface nephrin with WT ShcA but not SH2 * ( n = 3 ) . All values were made relative to biotinylation result of cells transfected with Myc - nephrin alone . * P , 0 . 05 ; * * P , 0 . 01 , two - tailed t test .

Consistentwiththisnotion , wehaveshownthatglomerular ShcA expression is induced in rodents exposed to PAN and humans with FSGS and MCD , coincident with nephrin mis - localization and proteinuria . Such atypical localization of nephrin is similarly seen in early stages of membranous ne - phropathy . 37 We further demonstrate prominent internaliza - tion of phosphorylated nephrin , overlapping with EEA1 and podocin in the PAN model , as well as reduced surface expres - sion of nephrin and podocin . Our ﬁ ndings provide compel - ling evidence to suggest that excessive nephrin endocytosis underlies the disease process . Moreover , the overall decrease in total nephrin phosphorylation reported previously in PAN , MCD , and membranous nephropathy 21 , 22 , 37 implies that in - ternalized nephrin is subject to dephosphorylation . Intrigu - ingly , nephrin dephosphorylation is accompanied by an Figure 4 . PAN nephrosis induces upregulation of ShcA and nephrin endocytosis .

This may prolong disruption of the ﬁ ltration barrier and traf ﬁ c internalized nephrin into recy - cling or destruction pathways . 40 Surface expression and intracellular traf ﬁ cking of nephrin and podocin are intimately linked , as we observed throughout the PAN injury time course .

Further studies will reveal the potential for ShcA to serve as a biomarker for podocyte injury . Figure 6 . ShcA is upregulated in human proteinuric kidney dis - eases .

Densitometry was per - formed using ImageLab v2 . 0 analysis software ( BioRad ) . AP - 1 Luciferase Assay HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 m g AP - 1 ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase , 80 ng renilla luciferase , and additional vectors as indicated , to a total DNA amount of 2 m g per 35 - mm dish . Serum - starved cells were harvested on ice in 1 ml PBS , spun at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 2 minutes , lysed in 100 m l of 1 3 passive lysis buffer ( Promega ) , and spun againat 13 , 000 rpm at 4°C for 2 minutes to remove insoluble material . Lu - ciferase activity was determined using a commercial dual luciferase assay system ( Promega ) on a POLARstar Omega microplate reader ( BMG Labtech ) and normalized torenilla activity to correct for trans - fection ef ﬁ ciency . Protein expression was con ﬁ rmed by immunoblot . Biotinylation Isolated glomeruli or adherent cells were incubated with 5 ml of 1 mg / ml EZ - Link Biotin - X - NHS dissolved in borate buffer ( 10 mM boric acid , 150 mM NaCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] ) for 45 minutes under gentle agitation at 4°C . Coupling was terminated by washing two times ( 2 minutes each ) with 15 mM glycine in PBS at 4°C . After a ﬁ nal wash in PBS , glomeruli or cells were lysed in PLC + buffer , and sonicated for 10 seconds . Lysates were then subjected to streptavidin agarose precipitation overnight at 4°C or resuspended in two times SDS loading buffer to act as the input loading control . After overnight precipitation , beads were washed three times successively in PLC + , and spun at 3000 3 g for 1 minute between washes before ﬁ nally being resuspended and boiled in 50 m l two times SDS loading buffer . Surface nephrin or podocin in each sample was determined by dividing the density of band observed in immunoblotting of the precipitated sample by the density of band observed in the input sample . The ratio of this value in test samples to the value obtained in control samples was calculated and represents the amount of surface nephrin in indicated test groups relative to control samples . PAN Nephrosis For in vivo experiments , male Sprague – Dawley rats ( 250 – 300 g ) were obtained from Charles River ( St . Constant , Quebec , Canada ) . One injection of PAN ( 50 mg / kg body wt ) was used to induce podocyte injury , as described previously . 47 Rats were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hours and allowed to urinate freely . Urinary protein was quan - ti ﬁ ed by the modi ﬁ ed Bradford assay . 48 For induction in cell culture , human podocyte cells differentiated for 7 days were treated with 10 mg / ml PAN for 24 hours before further processing . Indirect Immuno ﬂ uorescence of Kidney Tissue Sections Kidneys were either snap frozen in cryomatrix ( Thermo Fisher ) or ﬁ xed and embedded in paraf ﬁ n before sectioning and immunostain - ing . Cryosections ( 6 m m ) were dried at room temperature for 10 minutes , then ﬁ xed and permeabilized in acetone at 2 20°C for 10 minutes before immunostaining . For paraf ﬁ n embedding , kidneys were ﬁ rst ﬁ xed in fresh 4 % PFA ( # 28908 ; Thermo Fisher ) for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed three times for 30 minutes in PBS , then stored in 70 % ethanol until embedding . Paraf ﬁ nsections ( 4 m m ) were deparaf ﬁ nized and rehydrated using standard protocols . After antigen retrieval with heated 10 mM trisodium citrate dihydrate buffer , immunostaining was performed as with frozen kidneys . All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature . When using the phospho - nephrin antibodies , phosSTOP tablets ( Roche ) were added to all solutions . Slides were blocked for 1 hour in 10 % goat serum , thenincubated with primary antibodies for1 hour ( guinea pig anti - nephrin [ 1 : 100 ] , rabbit anti - nephrin [ 1 : 50 ] , rabbit anti – pY1217 - nephrin [ 1 : 50 ] , rabbit anti - podocin [ 1 : 100 ] , mouse anti - ShcA [ 1 : 50 ] , or mouse anti - EEA1 [ 1 : 100 ] ) . After three washes in PBS , slides were incubated with secondary antibodies ( 1 : 400 ) for 1 hour . Slides were washed , then mounted using Prolong Gold antifade mounting medium ( Invitrogen ) . Epi ﬂ uorescence images were ob - tained from cryosections using Volocity software version 5 . 3 . 2 ( Im - provision ) on a DMIRE2 microscope ( Leica ) using a 40 3 objective . Stacks were captured at 0 . 2 m m z - intervals , then deconvolved using an iterative restoration function ( 95 % con ﬁ dence with 15 iterations ) in Volocity . Super - resolution structured illumination microscopy images were gathered from rat PAN paraf ﬁ n - embedded sections us - ing an Elyra LSM 880 microscope ( Zeiss ) and processed with ZEN software . Human sections were paraf ﬁ n embedded and processed as described above , and imaged using ZEISS LSM780 confocal microscope .
