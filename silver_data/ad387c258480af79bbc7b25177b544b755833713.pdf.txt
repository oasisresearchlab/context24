Ye et al . compared the similarity between implement a general purpose automated leaf recognition for plant features to classify plants [ 2 ] . classification . 12 leaf features are extracted and orthogonalized into 5 principal variables which consist the input vector of the Many approaches above employ k - nearest neighbor ( k - NN ) PNN . The PNN is trained by 1800 leaves to classify 32 kinds of classifier [ 1 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] while some papers adopted Artificial plants with an accuracy greater than 90 % . Compared with other Neural Network ( ANN ) . Saitoh et al . combined flower and approaches , our algorithm is an accurate artificial intelligence leaf information to classify wild flowers [ 20 ] . Heymans et al . approach which is fast in execution and easy in implementation . proposed an application of ANN to classify opuntia species [ 21 ] . Du et al . introduced shape recognition based on radial Index Terms - Probabilstic atwor basis probabilistic neural network which is trained by orthogo - tion , leaf recognition , plant classification nal least square algorithm ( OLSA ) and optimized by recursive OLSA [ 22 ] . It performs plant recognition through modified Fourier descriptors of leaf shape . Plants exist everywhere we live , as well as places without Previous work have some disadvantages . Some are only us . Many of them carry significant information for the devel - applicable to certain species [ 3 ] [ 16 ] [ 21 ] . As expert system , opment of human society . The urgent situation is that many some methods compare the similarity between features [ 2 ] [ 8 ] . plants are at the risk of extinction . So it is very necessary to It requires pre - process work of human to enter keys manually . set up a database for plant protection [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] . We believe that This problem also happens on methods extracting features the first step is to teach a computer how to classify plants . used by botanists [ 7 ] [ 16 ] . Compared with other methods , such as cell and molecule biology methods , classification based on leaf image is the Among all approaches , ANN has the fastest speed and first choice for leaf plant classification . Sampling leaves and accuracy for classification work . [ 22 ] indicates that ANN photoing them are low - cost and convenient . One can easily classiier ( M = l , 4 RBN and RBPNN ) iru fater transfer the leaf image to a computer and a computer can ANN c ksfe 4 ) vandM o h y p classifier ' hil extract features automatically in image processing techniques . aNN assfes advanceothe Some systems employ descriptions used by botanists [ 5 ] _ paper adopts an ANN approach [ 8 ] . But it is not easy to extract and transfer those features to This paper implements a leaf recognition algorithm using a computer automatically . This paper tries to prevent human easy - to - extract features and high efficient recognition algo - interference in feature extraction . rithm . Our main improvements are on feature extraction and It is also a long discussed topic on how to extract or measure the classifier . All features are extracted from digital leaf image . leaf features [ 9 ] - [ 15 ] . That makes the application of pattern Except one feature , all features can be extracted automatically . recognition in this field a new challenge [ 1 ] [ 16 ] . According 12 features are orthogonalized by Principal Components Anal - to [ 1 ] , data acquisition from living plant automatically by the ysis ( PCA ) [ 23 ] . As to the classifier , we use PNN [ 24 ] for its computer has not been implemented . fast speed and simple structure . The whole algorithm is easy - Several other approaches used their pre - defined features . to - implement , using common approaches .

The output image replaces all pixels in the input image with Process Image luminance greater than the level by the value 1 and replaces all other pixels by the value 0 . extract features A rectangular averaging filter of size 3 x 3 is applied to l extract features filter noises . Then pixel values are rounded to 0 or 1 . | _ PCA B . Boundary Enhancement lWhen mentioning the leaf shape , the first thing appears in Train PNN your mind might be the margin of a leaf .

To make boundary as a black curve on white background , the " 0 " " 1 " value of pixels is swapped . II . IMAGE PRE - PROCESSING A . Converting RGB image to binary image The leaf image is acquired by scanners or digital cameras . RGBtograysle grayscale to binary Since we have not found any digitizing device to save the smoothing image in a lossless compression format , the image format here is JPEG . All leaf images are in 800 x 600 resolution . There is no restriction on the direction of leaves when photoing . filtering in W Laplacian filter An RGB image is firstly converted into a grayscale image . Eq . 1 is the formula used to convert RGB value of a pixel into its grayscale value . Fig . 3 .

In this paper , 12 commonly used digital morphological The level to convert grayscale into binary image is deter - features ( DMFs ) , derived from 5 basic features , are extracted mined according to the RGB histogram . We accumulate the so that a computer can obtain feature values quickly and pixel values to color R , G , B respectively for 3000 leaves automatically ( only one exception ) . and divide them by 3000 , the number of leaves . The average histogram to RGB of 3000 leaf images is shown as Fig . 2 . A . Basic Geometric Features R G B Firstly , we obtain 5 basic geometric features . 9000 1000000000 ) Diameter : The diameter is defined as the longest dis - 8000 9000 9000 tance between any two points on the margin of the leaf . It is 7000 8000 8000 denoted as D . 6000 7000 7000 2 ) Physiological Length : The only human interfered part of 5000 - 6000 6000 our algorithm is that you need to mark the two terminals of the 4000 4000 4000 main vein of the leaf via mouse click . The distance between 3000 3000 3000 the two terminals is defined as the physiological length . It is 2000 ~ 2000 l2000 denoted as Lp . 1000 1000 10001 3 ) Physiological WiEdth . Drawing a line passing through 0 1 0000 I 0 - ~ ~ ~ ~ the two terminals of ~ the main vein , one can plot infinite 0 100 200 0 100 200 0 100 200 lines orthogonal to that line . The number of intersection pairs between those lines and the leaf margin is also infinite . The Fig . 2 . RGB histogram longest distance between points of those intersection pairs is defined at the physiological width . It is denoted as Wp . There are two peaks in every color ' s histogram . The left Since the coordinates of pixels are discrete , we consider two peak refers to pixels consisting the leaf while the right peak lines are orthogonal if their degree is 900 i 0 . 50 . refers to pixels consisting the white background . The lowest The relationship between physiological length and physio - point between two peaks is around the value 242 on the logical width is illustrated in Fig . 4 . 12 Av1 , Av2 , Av3 and Av4 respectively . Then we obtain the last 5 features : Av1 / A , Av2 / A , Av3 / A , Av4 / A , Av4 / Av1 . Now we have finished the step of feature acquisition and go on to the data analysis section . , - - / 90 \ ~ ~ ~ ~ physiological length / IV . PROPOSED SCHEME A .

The purpose of PCA - 0 two terminals of is to present the information of original data as the linear com - the main vein bination of certain linear irrelevant variables . Mathematically , PCA transforms the data to a new coordinate system such Fig . 4 . Relationship between Physiological Length and Physiological Width that the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate , the second greatest variance on the second coordinate , and so on .

B . 12 Digital Morphological Features Based on 5 basic features introduced previously , we can B . Introduction to Probabilistic Neural Network define 12 digital morphological features used for leaf recog - nition . An artificial neural network ( ANN ) is an interconnected 1 ) Smooth factor : We use the effect of noises to image group of artificial neurons simulating the thinking process of area to describe the smoothness of leaf image . In this paper , human brain . One can consider an ANN as a " magical " black smooth factor is defined as the ratio between area of leaf image box trained to achieve expected intelligent process , against the smoothed by 5 x 5 rectangular averaging filter and the one input and output information stream . Thus , there is no need smoothed by 2 x 2 rectangular averaging filter . for a specified algorithm on how to identify different plants . 2 ) Aspect ratio : The aspect ratio is defined as the ratio PNN is derived from Radial Basis Function ( RBF ) Network of physiological length Lp to physiological width Wp , thus which is an ANN using RBF . RBF is a bell shape function Lp / Wp . that scales the variable nonlinearly . 3 ) Form factor : This feature is used to describe the differ - PNN is adopted for it has many advantages [ 26 ] .

Additionally , it is robust to noise examples . 4 ) Rectangularity : Rectangularity describes the similarity We choose it also for its simple structure and training manner . between a leaf and a rectangle . It is defined as LpWp / A , where The most important advantage of PNN is that training is Lp is the physiological length , Wp is the physiological width easy and instantaneous [ 24 ] . Weights are not " trained " but and A is the leaf area . assigned . Existing weights will never be alternated but only 5 ) Narrow factor : Narrow factor is defined as the ratio of new vectors are inserted into weight matrices when training . the diameter D and physiological length Lp , thus D / Lp . So it can be used in real - time .

This feature is defined as the ratio of leaf perimeter In this paper , the PNN has three layers : the Input layer , P and the sum of physiological length Lp and physiological Radial Basis Layer and the Competitive Layer . Radial Basis width Wp , thus P / ( Lp + Wy ) . Layer evaluates vector distances between input vector and row 8 ) Vein features . We perform morphological opening [ 25 ] weight vectors in weight matrix . These distances are scaled on grayscale image with falt , disk - shaped structuring element by Radial Basis Function nonlinearly . Then the Competitive of radius 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and substract remained image by the margin . Layer finds the shortest distance among them , and thus finds The results look like the vein . That is why following 5 feature the training pattern closest to the input pattern based on their are called vein features .
