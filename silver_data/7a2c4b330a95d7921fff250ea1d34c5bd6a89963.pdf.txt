Extracellular space structure revealed by diffusion analysis Charles Nicholson and Eva Syková The structure of brain extracellular space resembles foam . Diffusing molecules execute random movements that cause their collision with membranes and affect their concentration distribution . By measuring this distribution , the volume fraction ( a ) and the tortuosity ( l ) can be estimated . The volume fraction indicates the relative amount of extracellular space and tortuosity is a measure of hindrance of cellular obstructions . Diffusion measurements with molecules , 500 M r show that a ≈ 0 . 2 and l ≈ 1 . 6 , although some brain regions are anisotropic . Molecules $ 3000 M r show more hindrance , but molecules of 70 000 M r can move through the extracellular space . During stimulation , and in pathophysiological states , a and l change , for example in severe ischemia a = 0 . 04 and l = 2 . 2 . These data support the feasibility of extrasynaptic or volume transmission in the extracellular space . Trends Neurosci . ( 1998 ) 21 , 207 – 215 T HE NEURONS and glial cells of the brain are min - gled together in an opaque mass with the consist - ency of soft jelly . The cells have complex shapes , yet remain distinct entities bounded by their membranes and separated from each other by an extracellular space ( ECS ) . Despite the geometrical complexity of the ECS , its structure can be characterized by analyzing the way molecules diffuse within it 1 . The ECS has been likened to a foam 2 ( Fig . 1 ) . The width of the space varies and may contain ‘lakes’ 3 , 4 ( Fig . 1 ) . Early attempts to use the electron microscope to measure the ECS found it to be almost non - existent . Today , electron microscopy that preserves the ECS , radiotracer methods and the TMA + method ( tetramethylammonium method ; Box 1 ) , all agree that the average ECS volume is about 20 % of the brain . Furthermore , radiotracer and TMA + methods reveal new structural information about the ECS through the tortuosity factor , which will be described in detail in this review . Finally , diffusion analysis can provide data on the uptake , loss and binding of molecules . The ECS exists for several reasons . It provides an extracellular microenvironment 5 , similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid , but with an additional matrix of Charles Nicholson is at the Dept of Physiology and Neuroscience , New York University Medical Center , 550 First Avenue , New York , NY 10016 , USA , and Eva Syková is at the Dept of Neuroscience , Institute of Experimental Medicine and 2nd Medical Faculty , Charles University , Videnská 1083 , 142 20 Prague 4 , Czech Republic . 208 TINS Vol . 21 , No . 5 , 1998 proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans 6 , 7 .

This box briefly outlines three diffusion methods that reveal structural information about the ECS . Values for the diffusion coefficients in water D , are given for some compounds in units of 10 – 6 cm 2 s – 1 . The apparent diffu - sion coefficient ( ADC ) D * , can be calculated from D * = D / l 2 where l is the tortuosity . Radiotracers Much of the pioneering work using the diffusion of radiotracers was carried out by Fenstermacher , Patlak and colleagues a – d ( Table 1 ) . To determine the volume fraction , a and l , a radiolabeled compound that remains in the ECS , such as [ 3 H ] inulin ( D = 2 . 5 ; 37°C ) a , [ 14 C ] sucrose ( D = 7 . 1 ; 37°C ) a or [ 14 C ] EDTA ( D = 7 . 0 ; 37°C ) c was perfused into the appropriate subarachnoid space of an anesthetized animal for several hours , then the brain region quickly removed , frozen and sectioned . Brains were processed at intervals after commencing perfusion to obtain different profiles of radioactivity . Using a suitable solution to the diffusion equation , D * could be calculated and compared with D measured in cylinders of agar . In some experi - ments , the loss or gain of substances across capillary walls was also estimated b . Radiotracer methods can characterize how many com - pounds distribute in the brain , including metabolites and chemotherapeutic compounds , but the method is limited because of the long perfusion periods and post - mortem processing involved . Radiotracer methods are still provid - ing new data , for example on ischemic tissue e and on the movement of nerve growth factor f . TMA + method ( real - time iontophoretic method ) This is the most widely used diffusion paradigm today . It originated in a study on K + diffusion by Lux and Neher g that employed ion - selective microelectrodes ( ISM ) . The original analysis was thwarted by the then - unrecognized issues of K + uptake and spatial buffering h , but the techni - cal approach was elaborated into the TMA + ( tetramethyl - ammonium ) method by Nicholson and Phillips i . The paradigm consists of the defined release of TMA + ( TEA + may be used instead ) i from a source that approximates a point and its measurement at a known distance . The TMA + ( D = 13 . 0 ; 37°C ) j is usually released by iontophoresis from a micropipette , and distributes in the tissue according to Eqn 3 ( Box 2 ) . The local concentration of TMA + is measured with an ISM ( Ref . j ) located about 100 – 200 m m from the release electrode ( Fig . 3A ) . Appropriate calibration and curve fitting procedures are performed to fit Eqn 3 ( Box 2 ) , both in brain and in dilute gel , and the parameters a , l and k’ ( where k’ is uptake ) extracted . TMA + ( or TEA + ) is used because it remains predominantly extracellular , and is small and does not alter physiological function at the concentrations used i ; some anions can be used instead i . The ISM can be sub - stituted with a carbon - fiber microelectrode , permitting fast - scan cyclic voltammetry for measurement of the dif - fusion of electroactive substances such as dopamine k . The small size of the source and measuring electrodes ( tip diameter 2 – 12 m m ) ensures that there is negligible edema or damage i . Integrative optical imaging ( IOI ) It is of considerable interest to know how macromol - ecules permeate the ECS . The IOI - method was developed to determine D * and l for macromolecules tagged with fluorescent probes in living brain tissue using epifluor - escence microscopy and quantitative image analysis l ( Fig . 4 ) . By taking account of how the microscope images in - focus and out - of - focus points , the relative concentration of the diffusing cloud of molecules can be quantified l , m . Studies have used dextrans l with M r of 3 kDa ( D = 2 . 33 ; 34°C ) l , 10 kDa , 40 kDa and 70 kDa ( D = 0 . 38 ; 34°C ) l . Further measurements employed lactalbumin n with M r of 14 . 4 kDa , ovalbumin n with M r of 45 kDa and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) n with M r of 66 kDa ( D = 0 . 83 ; 34°C ) n . Dextrans and albumins were delivered by a pressure - pulse method j . References a Levin , V . A . , Fenstermacher , J . D . and Patlak , C . S . ( 1970 ) Am . J .

Diffusion measurements in the ECS TINS Vol . 21 , No . 5 , 1998 209 for the transmembrane currents that generate action and synaptic potentials . Perhaps the most exciting role for the ECS , however , is as a communication channel 9 between cells . This channel is distinct from classical synaptic transmission , and has been termed extrasynaptic or volume transmission 10 – 12 . Diffusion reveals structure For many molecules , migration through the ECS is governed by diffusion . This observation can be turned around : the diffusion of ‘probe’ molecules can be used to reveal and quantify the structure of the ECS . Figure 2 shows how this comes about ; Fig . 2A depicts several cellular profiles embedded in a bounded region of ECS and a red ‘ + ’ marking the site where molecules would be released . After release ( Fig . 2B – 2D ) , the molecules execute random ‘walks’ in the ECS . As the number of particles increases through Fig . 2B – 2D , the structure of the ECS is revealed though the pattern of random walks . Figure 2 shows that the process of diffusion is sensi - tive to ECS structure . This sensitivity can be captured by measuring the parameter that characterizes the diffusion process : the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) . The ADC in the brain , often designated by D * , can be compared to the diffusion coefficient ( D ) in water or a very dilute gel , through the tortuosity l , a dimensionless number defined as l = ( D / D * ) G . Since D ‡ D * , it follows that l ‡ 1 . The tortuosity summarizes both the hindrance imposed by the cellular structures of the brain and the connectivity of the spaces . In principle , l is sensitive to certain forms of uptake ( Box 2 ) and the viscosity of the interstitial matrix ; it is presently believed that such influences are small . However , tortuosity is sensitive to molecular size and this reveals further information . Tortuosity may also be anisotropic . This means that l can have three distinct values : l x , l y and l z , each associ - ated with a geometrical axis ( i . e . that l is a tensor ) . Dif - fusion anisotropy was first detected in the cerebellum 13 . Recently , anisotropy has become important in diffu - sion - weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW - MRI ) studies 14 . Diffusion analysis also reveals the relative volume in which the diffusing molecules are moving . This is the volume fraction of the ECS , denoted by : a = volume of ECS / volume of tissue Volume fraction is also a dimensionless quantity and a £ 1 . Regional and comparative properties of the ECS The most extensively studied ECS is that of the neo - cortex , but measurements have also been made on the corpus callosum , hippocampus , cerebellum , caudate nucleus and spinal cord . The diffusion properties have been measured with three major methods ( described in Box 1 ) : radiotracers , the TMA + method ( also known as the real - time iontophoretic method ) and integrative optical imaging ( IOI ) . Cerebral cortex and corpus callosum Radiotracer diffusion measurements 15 have been made in the cat , dog and monkey ( Table 1 ) . More recently , the TMA + method was employed in the anes - thetized rat 16 , 17 . The most detailed study 18 determined a value for a of 0 . 19 ( cortical layer II ) , which increased with depth to 0 . 23 ( cortical layer VI ) , and l of C . Nicholson and E .

Other , more recent in vivo studies 19 , 20 ( Fig . 3A , B ) confirmed these values , which are consistent with those obtained in cortical slices 21 . Values measured with radiotracers are similar but probably less accurate ( Box 1 ) . Tortuosities change when larger molecules are used to probe the ECS . Studies with fluorescent dextrans 22 revealed that l increases from 1 . 77 to 2 . 25 as the M r increases from 3kDa to 70 kDa ( Fig . 4 ; Table 1 ) . Dextrans are loose aggregates of long - chain sugar molecules . By contrast , albumins are compact proteins , but they too generate higher tortuosities 23 than TMA + ( Table 1 ) . One interpretation of these results is that the ECS is not uniform in size but has narrow regions that exclude the larger molecules , thus making them take a longer path as they diffuse . Alternatively , the size of the molecules might be compar - able to the interstitial space leading to restricted diffu - sion 34 . These data show that molecules as large as 70kDa C . Nicholson and E . Syková – Extracellular space R EVIEW Box 2 . Microscopic and macroscopic diffusion in the ECS On a microscopic scale , diffusion in the ECS can be described by the random walks of molecules as they collide frequently with water molecules and occasionally with obstructions such as cell membranes . With a suitable statis - tical treatment , the behavior of a large ensemble of random walks , or Brownian movement as it is also called , can be described by the equations of classical macroscopic diffu - sion a ; these equations originated from the work of Adolf Fick . Diffusion measurements in the ECS involve distances of the order of 100 µm , and it is no longer relevant to talk of individual random walks of molecules . Fortunately , one can go seamlessly between the microscopic descriptions and the macroscopic ; many of the underpinnings of this theoretical bridge are due to Albert Einstein b . The various things that can affect the substance as it dis - tributes in the ECS are encapsulated in the macroscopic dif - fusion equation c , d : ( 1 ) The concentration ( mM ) is C ” C ( x , t ) . Position ( cm ) is denoted by the vector x ( x , y , z in a Cartesian co - ordinate system or r , u , w in a spherical coordinate system ) and time ( s ) denoted by t . The structure of the tissue is introduced through two non - dimensional factors : the volume fraction and the tor - tuosity . Volume fraction ( a ) of the ECS is the ratio of the ECS volume to that of the total in a representative elemen - tary tissue volume . Tortuosity ( l ) is a measure of how diffus - ing molecules ( path of travel shown in green , Fig . A ) are hindered by cellular obstructions ( Fig . A ) . Many early studies on the ECS focused on volume fraction , determined from the equilibrium distribution of radiotracers e . Tortuosity appears explicitly in an early study on muscle f and both ¶ ¶ = (cid:209) + (cid:209) C t D C Q C f C l a a 2 2 – – ( ) v . Fig . ( A ) Volume fraction , tortuosity and uptake . The concentration of a diffusing substance released from a microelectrode and confined to the ECS is modified by the volume fraction ( a ) , tortuosity ( l ) and uptake ( k ’ ) . The volume fraction is represented here by the spaces between the cells , as a fraction of the whole volume , and the tortuosity is represented by the green lines emanating from the tip of the source elec - trode . The increase in length of the lines , relative to a straight line , is indicated on the figure ( the calculation of tortuosity involves more com - plex averages over paths but this cartoon illustrates the idea ) . Additionally , diffusing molecules may be removed from the ECS at uptake sites ( red dots ) by a process represented by a suitable rate constant , k ’ ( s – 1 ) . ( B ) Theoretical diffusion curves illustrating effect of a , l and k ’ . Curves computed from Eqn 3 using a spacing between iontophoretic source and ISM of 100 m m , a transport number ( n ) of 0 . 4 and a current of 100nA for 50s ( indicated by the black bar ) . A background level of 0 . 5m M TMA + in the agar and brain was assumed in the calculation . The green curve represents the result in dilute agar gel for which a = 1 , l = 1 and k ’ = 0 . The blue curve shows the result in typical brain tissue when a = 0 . 2 , l = 1 . 6 and k ’ = 0 . The red curve shows the same brain tissue , but now with k ’ = 0 . 005s – 1 . It is evident that the combined effect of reduced volume fraction and increased tortuosity in brain , compared with a free medium , greatly increases the amplitude of the dif - fusion curve . The typical uptake usually seen in brain ( k ’ = 0 . 005s – 1 ) makes a small but detectable difference ; by routinely extracting the uptake contribution through appropriate non - linear curve fitting , the determination of a and l is made more accurate . TINS Vol . 21 , No . 5 , 1998 211 can diffuse through the ECS , even though their ADC ( D / l 2 ) is reduced fivefold compared with a free medium . A study 20 , using TMA + , of the corpus callosum ( Fig . 3D ) revealed that the tortuosity after myelination was anisotropic in this white matter region ( Table 1 ) . Hippocampus , caudate nucleus and cerebellum Initial studies with the TMA + method in the hip - pocampus 21 , 24 revealed inhomogeneity , that is , a and l had different values in different places ( Table 1 ) . Recent studies 25 ( Table 1 ) , however , suggest that unde - tected anisotropy in the CA1 region could have led to an under - estimate of a in the original studies . Radiotracer measurements in the caudate nucleus 26 , 27 in dog , rabbit and monkey gave similar results to those obtained recently with the TMA + method in slices of rat neostriatum ( caudate nucleus ; Table 1 ) . The striatum is of special interest because of the possible role of dopamine as an extrasynaptic transmitter 35 , 36 . C . Nicholson and E . Syková – Extracellular space R EVIEW volume fraction and tortuosity were employed in a paper on the cortex g . Tortuosity is a composite parameter that incor - porates several geometric effects . If the ECS is viewed as a set of pores and the diameter of the molecule is comparable to the size of the pore , restricted diffusion h could occur . The term on the left of Eqn 1 represents the way that the concentration changes with time at any location . The first term on the right of the equal sign in Eqn 1 describes the contribution of diffusion itself . The free diffusion coeffi - cient is D ( cm 2 s – 1 ) and the ADC , D * = D / l 2 . The symbol (cid:209) 2 represents the second spatial derivative in the appropriate co - ordinate system i . The second term is the source - term , Q ” Q ( x , t ) ( m M s – 1 ) , which can describe local iontophoretic c , pressure pulse release of molecules d , j , or local release of a substance from a cell . The third term represents the contribution of flow , if present . Flow is defined by the vector v ( cm s – 1 ) , and it forms a scalar product with the concentration gradient (cid:209) C . Cserr and collaborators k envisaged that molecular transport by bulk flow of fluid in the ECS was slow and took place in the restricted Virchow – Robin space adjacent to the brain capillaries . Bulk flow , when operative therefore , will have little influence on short - term and near - distance diffusion . Some evidence exists that peristaltic movements induced by vascular pulsation might disperse molecules within axon bundles l . The fourth term f ( C ) ( m M s – 1 ) represents uptake of ma - terial from the extracellular space , typically into cells , or degradation of the migrating substance by en - zymatic attack or other kinetic processes m . This term can also incorporate movement of substances across capillary walls n . Presently , the most widely used diffusion paradigm is release of a substance from a point source and meas - urement of its concentration in the surrounding volume at various times and distances . Under these conditions , the diffusion is spherical , so the only spatial variable is r . It is usually assumed that bulk flow is zero and the uptake is driven by the concentration gradient across the cell mem - branes with the intracellular concentration of the sub - stance being negligible . Then uptake can be defined by k’ ( s – 1 ) so that f ( C ) = a k’C in Eqn 1 , which becomes : ( 2 ) The appropriate solution for iontophoretic release ( TMA + method ) c , d , m , o is : ( 3 ) In Eqn 3 , H ( ) is the Heaviside step function and erfc ( ) is the complementary error function . For iontophoresis , the source term is Q = In / F , where I is the current ( amps ) , n is the transport number for the substance and electrode , and F is Faraday’s Electrochemical Equivalent . The du - ration of the source is d ( s ) . Graphs of Eqn 3 are shown in Fig . B . Equation 2 has been solved for when a substance is pressure - ejected from a source d , j , o . Equations 1 – 3 have been extended p to deal with anisotropy where l is a tensor with three components , l x , l y and l z . By using a non - linear curve fitting algorithm , such as the simplex , Eqn 3 can be fitted to experimental data and a , D * and k’ extracted . Obtaining a involves knowing n while l can be calculated from D * if D is known . Both n and D can be found by making diffusion measurements in a medium resembling the fluid in the ECS ( actually NaCl solution in 0 . 3 % agar or agarose to avoid thermal convection ) . In this medium , a = 1 , l = 1 and k’ = 0 . The diffusion analysis algo - rithms for ion - selective microelectrodes , fast - scan voltam - metry and both iontophoretic and pressure sources are incorporated in the program VOLTORO and a MATLAB program called Walter ( both available for the PC from C . Nicholson ) . This review focuses on the two structural parameters , a and l ; values for k’ can be found in many of the original papers , however . Typical values for TMA + are k’ = 0 . 005s – 1 in most brain regions ( Fig . B illustrates effect of uptake ) . Note that certain types of fast reversible uptake ( see ref . i , Chapter 14 ) are formally identical to an increase in l . Finally , Eqs . 1 – 3 have been extended to describe the iontophoresis of dopamine with Michaelis – Menten uptake m . References a Berg , H . C . ( 1993 ) Random Walks in Biology .

In addition , anionic probes were used 1 to look for any effect of negative charge on the diffusion properties of the extracellular matrix . No significant effect was seen in this early investigation , perhaps because the preponderance of Na + ( ~ 150 mM ) in the ECS screens negative charge . The initial studies on the cerebellum 1 did not detect any anisotropy . More refined analysis 13 , however , showed that the molecular layer is anisotropic with l x = 1 . 44 along the parallel fibers , l y = 1 . 95 across the parallel fibers and in the plane of the pial surface , and l z = 1 . 58 in the vertical direction . The a of the mol - ecular layer is 0 . 31 , about 50 % higher than that encountered in the cerebral cortex . The granular cell layer , quite different structurally from the molecular layer , is isotropic ( Table 1 ) . Thus , the cerebellum exhibits both anisotropy and inhomogeneity . The anisotropy determined in the cerebellar molecular layer , the hippocampus and the corpus callosum will channel excess excitatory transmitters that spill over at the synapses 38 and other neuroactive substances , in specific directions 13 . Spinal cord Compared with recent TMA + measurements 30 – 33 , early radiotracer 29 measurements on the spinal cord of the monkey produced low values for a and high val - ues for l ( Table 1 ) . The TMA + measurements show that the gray matter of the rat spinal cord has similar struc - tural parameters to the cortex ( Table 1 ) . Anisotropic diffusion occurs , however , in spinal cord white matter ( ventral funiculus ) 33 ; as in the corpus callosum 20 , this anisotropy only appears with myelination . In myeli - nated tissue , preferential diffusion of neuroactive sub - stances and metabolites , therefore , might occur along the axons . The developing brain Early studies used electron microscopy 4 to address the fascinating issue of how the ECS changed its a as C . Nicholson and E . Syková – Extracellular space R EVIEW Fig . 2 .

( B ) Three molecules have been released from the location marked with a red ‘ + ’ in ( A ) and allowed to execute up to 150 random steps . Each particle has been assigned a different color . If they cross a cell boundary or wall , the step is canceled and the next random step selected ( for simplicity , the ran - dom walks were confined to the plane of view , that is , these are two - dimensional random walks ) . The profiles of the cells are omitted from this and ( C ) and ( D ) ; only the trajectories of the random walks are shown . The three walks in ( B ) appear to have a random distribution . ( C ) Twelve particles execute random walks and now the picture begins to reveal the presence of the cells .

Note that the steps are large in this simulation to reduce the number required to reveal the geometry . Fig . 3 . Tetramethylammonium ( TMA + ) diffusion curves under differ - ent experimental conditions . ( A ) Schema of the experimental arrange - ment . A double - barreled , TMA + - selective microelectrode ( TMA + - ISM ) was glued to a bent iontophoresis microelectrode with a separation between electrode tips of 100 – 200 m m . ( B – D ) The ECS diffusion parameters a ( volume fraction ) and l ( tortuosity ) are extracted by appropriate non - linear curve fitting . Experimental and theoretical curves ( obtained using Eqn 3 in Box 2 ) are superimposed in each case ; the concentration scale is linear . ( B ) Typical recordings obtained in rat cortex at postnatal days ( P ) four ( shown in green ) and 21 ( shown in red ) . Values of a and l are shown with each record . Note that the larger the curve , the smaller the value of a . ( C ) Typical recordings obtained in adult rat cortex ( lamina V ) during normoxia ( red ) and in the same animal at about 10 minutes after cardiac arrest ( anoxia , shown in blue ) . ( D ) Representative records obtained in corpus callosum ( CC ) under anisotropic conditions , from diffusion measurements in three orthogonal axes [ x ( red ) , y ( green ) and z ( blue ) ] . The x - axis lies along the axons ; the y - and z - axes lie across the fibers in the CC . All recordings are from the same animal at P21 and were recorded with two microelectrode arrays . Recordings were first made with a micro - electrode array in the x - and y - axes . The second microelectrode track was made with an array fixed in the y - and z - axes . The values in the y - axis were the same as those obtained with the first array ( not shown ) . The shape and amplitude of the diffusion curves reflect the different apparent diffusion coefficents ( ADCs ) associated with each axis . TINS Vol . 21 , No . 5 , 1998 213 the animal developed . The results have been largely confirmed with TMA + methods , which , in addition , have provided data on the l . In the cortex and corpus callosum of the newborn rat , a is about double ( 0 . 36 – 0 . 46 ) that of the adult 18 , 20 , 39 , whereas l in newborn rats is not significantly different from that in adults ( Fig . 3B ) . The large ECS in the developing CNS might allow for the more effective diffusion of macromolecules , such as growth factors and cytokines . Diffusion might also be important in the developmental process itself 12 , 40 . Changes in the membrane currents of glial cells as - sociated with myelination have been correlated with ECS diffusion parameters 41 . As a result of reduced a , mem - brane fluxes produce larger changes in extracellular K + concentration in the mature , myelinated corpus callosum , compared with the newborn . The relationship between the ECS and membrane currents could also account for differences between currents measured in slices and those in tissue culture , where the ECS is effectively infinite . The size and geometry of the ECS may also influence the role of glial cells in spatial buffering of K + ( Ref . 41 ) . Diffusion parameters during stimulation and in pathological states Given that a and l exhibit approximately constant values throughout the normal brain , it is of interest to see how they change when the brain itself is altered . Long - term changes in the parameters of the ECS accompany repetitive neuronal activity , nociceptive stimulation and pathological states 12 , 30 , 41 . In the cat cortex , large changes in transmembrane fluxes of K + , Na + and Cl – are accompanied by the movement of water , cellular swelling and changes in a ( Refs 42 , 43 ) . Osmotic stress By combining TMA + measurements with water con - tent analysis , it is feasible to dissect the way water moves between the intracellular and extracellular compart - ments . In one study 16 , anesthetized rats were made hypernatremic , and the cortex lost water at the expense of the ECS , while regulatory mechanisms conserved cell volume . Another study 28 exposed the isolated turtle cerebellum to hypotonic medium , and a fell to 0 . 12 , whereas in hypertonic medium a increased to as much as 0 . 60 . Because total tissue volume hardly altered , the cells must have changed their volume . Tortuosity varied between 1 . 50 and 1 . 79 in these experiments 28 . Ischemia During hypoxia and terminal anoxia in vivo , TMA + measurements reveal that a in rat cortex 17 , 19 ( Fig . 3C ) or spinal cord 31 decreases to 0 . 04 . It is remarkable that the volume fraction never falls below this value . In these experiments , l increased to about 2 . 2 , which seems to be the upper value that can be measured with a small molecule like TMA + ( but l can be larger than 2 . 2 with macromolecules , even under normal condi - tions , Table 1 ) . The time course of the changes in white matter is slower than in gray matter , and the time course in neonatal rats is about ten times slower than in adults 19 . This correlates with the well - known resistance of the immature CNS to anoxia . ECS diffu - sion parameters have also been studied in brain slices during hypoxia 21 , 44 , where the changes in a and l were slightly smaller than those in vivo . The changes in diffusion parameters during and after ischemia will enhance the accumulation of substances , contributing to brain damage and hindering the influx of meta - bolic substrates during any subsequent reperfusion . DW - MRI and anoxia DW - MRI ( Ref . 45 ) is becoming a valuable tool for the diagnosis of brain anoxia . The ADC of water is reduced dramatically during anoxia and ischemia 46 but the mechanism of this reduction is still debated 47 . A comparison 48 of the ADCs of TMA + and water in rats 8 – 9 days of age during terminal anoxia has revealed very similar time courses , correlating with both a decrease in a and increase in l . However , water can move freely across cellular membranes , whereas TMA + stays predominantly in the ECS , and these experi - ments have not identified the mechanism that causes the changes of the ADC of water during anoxia . Brain injury Brain injury , with consequent neuronal death and astrogliosis , results in changes in ECS architecture . One model of brain injury is X - irradiation in the immature CNS , which is more sensitive to radiation than the adult 49 . In the cortex and corpus callosum of immature rats , X - irradiation results in radiation necrosis with typical early morphological changes in the tissue 39 . X - irradi - ation at postnatal day ( P ) one not only blocked the ex - pected decrease in a during postnatal development 18 , but caused a to increase to about 0 . 50 for several weeks after treatment 39 . Tortuosity decreased 1 – 4 days after irradiation but 7 – 9 days later , the values were the same as control and 1 – 3 weeks after X - irradiation there was an unusual increase in l . The rise in l might be accounted for by diffusion barriers formed by new glial processes or changes in extracellular matrix expression . C . Nicholson and E . Syková – Extracellular space R EVIEW Fig . 4 . Diffusion of 3kDa dextran measured with IOI method . At time zero ( 0 s ) a few nano - liters of 3 kDa dextran labeled with the fluorescent dye Texas Red were pressure ejected from a micropipette into either 0 . 3 % agarose ( agar ) or a cortical slice . The cloud of dye molecules was viewed through an epifluorescent microscope and imaged with a cooled CCD camera 22 . Images are shown at four , eight and 16 s after the injection , with the dye concentration depicted in pseudo color ( red highest concentration , blue lowest ) . The dextran diffuses away more quickly in the agarose ( free medium ) than in the cortex ( hindered medium ) . The lowest panel shows concentration ( intensity ) profiles along a horizontal line through the center of the cloud of diffusing molecules ; green profiles are from agar records , red from cortex . The profiles confirm the more rapid dispersion in the free medium compared with the hindered medium , and the characteristic bell - shaped curve of the concentration . Appropriate analysis of the curves enables D , D * and l to be obtained . Scale bar , 282 m m . 214 TINS Vol . 21 , No . 5 , 1998 Inflammatory and demyelinating diseases Following intracerebral bacterial inoculation 50 , acute inflammation and an increase in blood – brain barrier permeability in the abscess region occurred . There was a slightly larger a and slightly smaller l than normal but without significant brain edema . Dramatic changes in ECS diffusion parameters were found in the spinal cords of rats using a model of mul - tiple sclerosis consisting of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) induced by injection of myelin basic protein 32 . This resulted in paraparesis and damage to the blood – brain barrier accompanied by a transient increase in a to about 0 . 30 and a decrease in l . What diffusion has told us about the ECS Molecules released from a source in the ECS per - form countless random steps . In the process , they explore the intricate structure of the spaces that con - fine them . Two parameters , a and l , give a summary of the exploration . Volume fraction ( pore space or void fraction ) and l are well known in the study of porous media , which range from sandy beaches to chromatograph columns . It is known ( Table 1 ) that in most brain regions , a is about 0 . 2 , whereas in homogeneous and isotropic brain regions , l is about 1 . 5 – 1 . 6 . This means that the ADC is reduced by 2 . 6 compared with water . The generality of these values are strikingly confirmed by diffusion measurements with the TMA + method on the brains of cephalopod invertebrates 51 , which yield similar values to the vertebrates . During early develop - ment , a is considerably larger than in the adult . The fact that 20 % of the brain is ECS reflects the need for a significant brain extracellular microenvi - ronment 5 . The magnitude of l implies something about the structure of brain tissue . As often noted , the value of l is close to p / 2 , the ratio of the path around a sphere to one through the center . This suggests that tortuosity is mainly determined by simple geometry and that the ECS is highly connected with generally convex , non - invaginated , cell surfaces . Furthermore , the viscosity of the ECS must be close to that in the CSF ; this could imply that the density of the extra - cellular matrix is quite sparse . A general mathematical relationship between the random structure of the ECS and l has yet to be formulated , although it can be given for aggregates of some regularly spaced cells . The typical values for l are based on the movement of molecules that are assumed sufficiently small to penetrate all regions of the ECS . When larger mol - ecules are used ( M r ‡ 3000 ) , the measured l increases and this suggests that some of the spaces in the brain might restrict the diffusion of macromolecules . Stimulation of cells can lead to changes in a and l , presumably because cells change their volume , indi - cating that the ECS is a dynamic entity . More extreme changes occur during simulated brain pathology . The resulting alterations in the ECS also influence the pro - gression and recovery from the pathology itself . Osmotic or ischemic insults cause cellular swelling and consequent reduction in a and a rise in l . Nevertheless , the spaces of the brain are never totally occluded . During longer - lasting injuries , such as X - irradiation and EAE , the behavior of the ECS is more complex . A persistent increase in l , without a corre - sponding decrease in a was found during astrogliosis and in myelinated tissue . On both theoretical and experimental grounds , a and l seem to behave as inde - pendent variables . Long - term changes in l might result from changes in the density of glial processes , or possibly from changes in the extracellular matrix , or both . In addition to a structural description of the ECS , diffusion analysis also provides physiological infor - mation about the uptake or binding of molecules and their loss across the blood – brain barrier . What are the implications of our new understand - ing of ECS structure for extrasynaptic or volume trans - mission ? We know that a wide range of molecular sizes ( at least up to 70 000 M r ) can migrate through the ECS , and from our knowledge of a and l ( Box 2 ) we can predict their diffusion behavior . This behavior can be modified by local inhomogeneity and by anisotropy in l , which will tend to channel molecules in a particular direction . Furthermore , we have increasing evidence of selective ‘filtering’ of large mol - ecules that might exclude them from certain regions of the ECS . Molecules enter the ECS either from the spillover of transmitter 35 , 38 or by release from non - synaptic locations 10 , 11 , 52 . For some molecules , such as dopamine , the extent of their migration can be deter - mined by uptake or re - uptake 35 , 53 . Finally , we know that the diffusion properties of the ECS can respond rapidly to neuronal activity and pathophysiology , and these effects could profoundly alter the way infor - mational substances distribute 54 . In conclusion , the new findings on the diffusion properties of the ECS further support the concept of volume transmission . Selected references 1 Nicholson , C . and Phillips , J . M . ( 1981 ) J .

Syková – Extracellular space R EVIEW Orphanin FQ / nociceptin : a role in pain and analgesia , but so much more Tristan Darland , Mary M . Heinricher and David K . Grandy The publication of the d opioid receptor sequence led to the cloning of three homologous receptors : the m and k opioid receptors , and a novel opioid - like orphan receptor . The orphan receptor’s endogenous ligand , a 17 - amino - acid peptide that resembles dynorphin , was named ‘orphanin FQ’ and ‘nociceptin’ ( OFQ / N 1 – 17 ) . The OFQ / N 1 – 17 receptor is expressed widely in the nervous system , and it is becoming clear that the peptide is likely to participate in a broad range of physiological and behavioral functions . At the cellular level , OFQ / N 1 – 17 has much in common with the classical opioids ; however , functional studies are now revealing distinct actions of this peptide . Identified only two years ago , OFQ / N 1 – 17 has already attracted a great deal of attention . The number and diversity of papers focused on OFQ / N 1 – 17 at the recent meeting of the Society for Neuroscience augur an exciting future for this new peptide . Trends Neurosci . ( 1998 ) 21 , 215 – 221 M ORE THAN 30 years of research has established that opioids activate three distinct classes of G protein - coupled receptor : m , k and d . However , addi - tional receptor subtypes such as m 1 and m 2 , and k 1 , k 2 and k 3 ( Ref . 1 ) were subsequently proposed to explain some of the more puzzling aspects of opioid pharma - cology . As a consequence , cloning of the d opioid receptor by Evans et al . 2 and Kieffer et al . 3 sparked an intense international effort to clone the remaining members of this potentially large gene family . It was , therefore , something of a surprise that instead of the expected multitude of opioid receptors , the prod - ucts of only four distinct genes have so far been cloned . Three of these encode the classic d , m and k opioid re - ceptors 4 , 5 . Interestingly , although the fourth encodes a receptor ( variously known as LC132 , ORL1 , XOR , ROR - C and KOR3 ) that was originally identified because of its extensive nucleotide sequence homology with the d receptor 6 , 7 ( see Ref . 8 for a recent review ) , this receptor does not bind opioid ligands with high affinity . It came to be known as the ‘opioid - like orphan receptor’ , and the race to identify its endogenous ligand was on . The endogenous ligand for the opioid - like orphan receptor : orphanin FQ / nociceptin 1 – 17 At the 1995 meeting of the International Narcotics Research Conference in St Andrews , Scotland , J . C . Meunier reported the isolation of a 17 - amino acid pep - tide from rat brain that decreased forskolin - stimulated cAMP production in vitro . A paper terming this peptide ‘nociceptin’ was subsequently published by Meunier et al . 9 A peptide of identical sequence , isolated from pig brain , was reported simultaneously by Reinscheid et al . 10 who named it orphanin FQ ( OFQ ; Fig . 1 ) 11 , 12 . For the purposes of this article , the peptide will be referred to as ‘orphanin FQ / nociceptin’ ( OFQ / N ) . The studies conducted by Reinscheid et al . 10 demonstrated that a monoiodinated , tyrosine - substituted analog of OFQ / N 1 – 17 has nanomolar affinity for the opioid - like orphan receptor , and couples it to the inhibition of forskolin - stimulated cAMP production in a naloxone - insensitive manner . Several groups have subsequently modified the sequence of the OFQ / N 1 – 17 peptide . In one study , Reinscheid et al . 13 performed a systematic scanning mutagenesis survey and determined that , although residues in the amino - terminal portion of the peptide are important , the entire sequence is required for high affinity binding to , and activation of , the rat OFQ / N receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells . In another study , Butour et al . 14 reported similar findings using membranes prepared from CHO cells that express the human receptor whereas Shimohigashi et al . 15 found that several synthetic derivatives of OFQ / N 1 – 17 display Tristan Darland is at the Dept of Cell and Developmental Biology , Oregon Health Sciences University , Portland , OR , USA , Mary M .
