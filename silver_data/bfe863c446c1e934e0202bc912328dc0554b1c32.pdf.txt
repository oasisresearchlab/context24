It can feel like a mystery : intangible , inexplicable , and beyond the reach of science . However , science is making exciting headway into understanding creativity . While the mind of a highly uncreative individual consists of a collection of items accumulated through direct experience and enculturation , the mind of a creative individual is self - organizing and self - mending ; thus , experiences and items of cultural knowledge are thought through from different perspectives such that they cohere together into a loosely integrated whole . The reweaving of items in memory is elicited by perturbations : experiences that increase psychological entropy because they are inconsistent with one’s web of understandings . The process of responding to one perturbation often leads to other perturbations , i . e . , other inconsistencies in one’s web of understandings . Creative thinking often requires the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of thought in response to the ever - changing demands of the creative task . Since uncreative individuals can reap the benefits of creativity by imitating creators , using their inventions , or purchasing their artworks , it is not necessary that everyone be creative . Agent based computer models of cultural evolution suggest that society functions best with a mixture of creative and uncreative individuals . The ideal ratio of creativity to imitation increases in times of change , such as we are experiencing now . Therefore it is important to educate the next generation in ways that foster creativity . The chapter concludes with suggestions for how educational systems can cultivate creativity . Maland , A . , & Gabora , L . ( 2019 ) . Educational implications of the self - made worldview concept .

It can feel like a mystery : intangible , inexplicable , and beyond the reach of science . However , science is now making exciting headway into understanding creativity . This chapter examines factors involved in the making of a creative mind , with the ultimate aim of helping educational systems to cultivate creative thinking . We believe the time for this is ripe , as our world is changing quickly , yielding new opportunities to be mined , new challenges to be met , and new problems to be solved . Thus , innovative thinkers are needed , perhaps more than ever before . The ‘Self - Made’ Worldview ( SMW ) We will use the term worldview to refer to a mind as it is experienced subjectively , from the inside . It is a way of seeing the world and being in the world that emerges as a result of the structure of ones’ web of understandings , beliefs , and attitudes . A worldview reveals itself through behaviour , expression , and how it responds to situations ( Gabora , 2017a ) . The worldviews of uncreative people consist largely of knowledge , social rules , and norms they’ve picked up from others through imitation and other social learning processes ( i . e . , process that involve learning from others ) . Uncreative people tend on the whole to be pleasant , reliable , and uncomplicated ( Feist , 1998 ) . Their worldviews are largely compilations of the knowledge , rules , and norms they’ve picked up from the world around them . If you were to envision the worldview of a very uncreative person , it might look like a stack of discrete and separate cards , with each card representing something they’ve seen , heard , or been told . Though in the classroom this type of student may be a teacher’s dream , simply reproducing knowledge while remaining obedient and passive in class may not be what it takes to nurture a future innovator . The worldview of a creative person , on the other hand , might be envisioned as a stack of cards set on fire , edges ruffling . They are in a state of frenzy , becoming increasingly less separate and distinct ; turning into something quite different from what they were previously . Despite the diversity of creative people , they tend to exhibit an overlap of certain personality traits , such as curiosity , openness , high energy , confidence , lack of reliability , rebelliousness , and a tendency to deeply immerse themselves in projects they feel passionate about , often to the exclusion of everything else ( Feist , 1998 ) . Unfortunately , teachers often have biases against creativity in the classroom ( Beghetto , 2013 ) , as they devalue those types of personality attributes , which may be regarded as disruptive , and are often at odds with the overall structure of modern education . Of course , in reality , almost everyone falls somewhere in between these two extremes . However , for simplicity , we refer to the worldview of an uncreative person as a socially - made worldview and the worldview of a creative person as a self - made worldview , or SMW for short . The Making of a Self - made Worldview The above - mentioned process of social learning is sometimes contrasted with individual learning , which involves learning outside a social context and which unfolds through direct experience in the world . It is sometimes assumed that individual learning encompasses creativity , but while individual learning culminates in the discovery of something in the world , creativity culminates in the generation of something that did not previously exist . Moreover , creativity can take place independent of direct experience in the world ; it can be wholly or partially internal as opposed to external , and unlike individual learning it can occur in a social context . Thus , creative people venture beyond both social and individual learning ; they rehash and reflect upon learned information , put their own spin on it , and make it their own ( Feinstein , 2006 ) . This happens through processes that Piaget ( 2013 ) referred to as assimilation —fitting new information into Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 4 one’s existing web of understandings—and accommodation —the complementary process of restructuring one’s existing web of understandings to make sense of the new information . In short , while an uncreative worldview reflects what the individual has been told , the structure of a creative worldview reflects what the individual has done with what he or she has been told : their imaginative spin , as well as symbol manipulation and deductive and abductive processes . An ‘uncreative’ student might fit well in a traditional education system wherein fact reproduction and rote memorization make for structured classrooms and efficient evaluations . A ‘creative’ student , however , is more likely to thrive in an environment that allows for more open - ended teaching methods . ( A concrete example of an open - ended assignment will be provided at the end of this chapter . ) A worldview—and particularly a SMW—is self - organizing and self - mending ( Gabora & Merrifield , 2012 ; see also Osgood & Tannenbaum , 1955 ) . SMWs explore and play with previously encoded knowledge and experiences , looking at them from different perspectives . As such , over time , items in memory tend to weave into a coherent web and take a form that may be unrecognizable to the original . In response to perturbations —i . e . , external stimuli or internal realizations that are found to be disturbing or inconsistent with deep - seated beliefs—the SMW reconfigures itself through local interactions amongst its components , and thereby maintains a more or less orderly structure . The SMW explores relationships amongst its contents to establish internal consistency , and does so spontaneously . If something surprises us , or someone does something that seems inconsistent with how they normally behave , we cannot stop ourselves from trying to figure out how and why . Our worldview attempts to mend itself , just as does a body when injured ; thus , we are inclined to explore possibilities and modify our interpretations of situations in order to restore our sense of consistency and integrity ( Greenwald , Banaji , Rudman , Farnham , Nosek , & Mellott , 2002 ) . The greater the tendency of a worldview to self - organize , the more likely that it comes to deviate from the status quo . However , since the internal upheaval that comes with self - organized restructuring can be cognitively and emotionally demanding , the SMW individual may be more likely to been seen as unusual ( Feist , 1998 ) , or even diagnosed with an affective disorder ( Andreasen , 1987 ) . On the plus side though , they have greater potential to produce something— be it an idea , artifact , or class project—that others will regard as creative . The Trade - off between Creating and Copying It isn’t actually necessary for everyone to be creative for the benefits of creativity to be felt by all . We can reap the rewards of a creative person’s ideas by copying them , buying from them , or simply admiring them . Few of us can design a skyscraper or compose an opera , but they are nevertheless ours to use and enjoy . As in any kind of evolutionary process , novelty must be balanced with preservation . In cultural evolution , the novelty - generating component is creativity , and the novelty - preserving components include imitation and other forms of social learning ( Gabora , 2013 ) . In an agent - based computational model of cultural evolution ( Gabora , 1995 ) , in which artificial neural network - based agents invent and imitate ideas , the society’s ideas evolve most quickly when there is a good mix of creative “inventors” and conforming “imitators” ( Gabora & Tseng , 2017 ) . Of course , if there are no creative agents , then there are no novel items or ideas to preserve in society . But , if there are too many creative agents , then the collective suffers by never implementing or sharing the fittest of those items or ideas . Thus , a society thrives when some individuals create and others preserve their best outputs . Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 5 So , there is a trade - off to peppering the world with creative minds . However , we should not avoid trying to enhance creativity in society—beginning with the classroom—because the pace of cultural change is accelerating more quickly than ever before . In some biological systems , when the environment is changing quickly , the mutation rate goes up . Similarly , in order to generate the innovative ideas that will keep us afloat during times of societal change , we need to encourage individuals to explore their creative musings . ‘Minding the Gap’ It is often the case that as soon as you clean one part of your house , such as the kitchen countertops , you notice how dirty other parts are , such as the floors and cupboards . The same principle holds true for your internal world ; once you restructure one part of your worldview ( e . g . , from making a new friend who challenges a stereotype you hold ) , you glimpse the need to revise other parts as well ( such as your judgement of others previously labeled with this stereotype ) . Similarly , it is widely known amongst scientists that answering one question , or solving one problem , often leads to others . So , ironically , though a SMW spends more time ‘fixing’ itself , it nevertheless still feels more in need of fixing . Whereas the uncreative worldview may not restructure itself until it experiences an external perturbation—i . e . , a disturbance in the outside world—the SWM continuously reevaluates its own structure by seeking , or even generating , perturbations . Thus , someone with a SMW is particularly inclined to experience the kind of question , problem , sense of incompletion or disconnect , feeling of curiosity , or need for self - expression that Feinstein ( 2006 ) notes tends to precede creativity . It may arise suddenly , or slowly over the course of years , and be either inconsequential or of far - reaching importance , and it has been described as a relatively chaotic cognitive state ( Guastello , 2002 ) . The state can be framed in terms of the concept of entropy , a term that comes from thermodynamics and information theory , and refers to the amount of uncertainty and disorder in a system . As self - organizing systems , worldviews minimize internal entropy by continually interacting with and adapting to their environments . As open systems , worldviews capture energy ( i . e . , knowledge or information ) from their environment , use it to maintain partially - stable states , and keep their own entropy low by displacing it into the outside world . Hirsh et al . ( 2012 ) use the term psychological entropy to refer to anxiety - provoking uncertainty , which they claim humans attempt to keep at a manageable level . However , uncertainty can also be experienced positively , as a wellspring for creativity ; not just negatively , as anxiety ( Gabora , 2017 ) . ( It can also be experienced as some combination of the two . ) Accordingly , the concept of psychological entropy has been redefined in terms of arousal rather than anxiety , i . e . , as arousal - provoking uncertainty rather than anxiety - provoking uncertainty . Our attention is often pulled toward arenas of life where there is conflict , confusion , or uncertainty , because they are an arousing source of psychological entropy , and the creative process restructures this high entropy material so as to make it more acceptable . Since SMWs are continuously reorganizing and re - assessing themselves , they are more inclined to detect psychological entropy and engage in self - organized restructuring . The Chaining of Thoughts and Actions Given that a mind is self - organizes , how does it accomplish this ? It has been proposed that the extraordinary creativity of the human mind was due to the onset of two exclusively human cognitive abilities . The first , which evolved following an increase in cranial capacity ( skull size ) approximately two million years ago , was the onset of the self - triggered recall and rehearsal Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 6 loop ( Donald , 1991 ) . This ‘loop’ marked the capacity for one thought to trigger another thought and enabled our early ancestors to rehearse and refine skills , recall and reflect upon the past , and fantasize about the future . It has also been referred to as chaining ( Gabora & Tseng , 2017 ) , as it enables the chaining of thoughts and actions into streams of free - association , critical reflection , or complex behavioral sequences . Chaining enabled our ancestors to minimize arousal by repeatedly considering high psychological entropy material from new contexts until it was amply reorganized and a new idea or perspective was achieved . Chaining concepts began by connecting items in memory that were previously assumed to be unrelated . This enabled our ancestors to respond flexibly to stimuli and then reflect on their responses . The hypothesis that the onset of the capacity for chaining made cultural evolution possible can be demonstrated by an agent - based computer model of cultural evolution , called EVOC ( for EVOlution of Culture ) . In EVOC , chaining increases the mean fitness and diversity of cultural outputs , which supports the hypothesis that chaining transformed a culturally stagnant society into one characterized by open - ended novelty ( Gabora , Chia , & Firouzi , 2013 ; Gabora & Smith , submitted ) . Although the ability to chain began long ago , it is probably not the case that all modern people are equally inclined to engage in it . The greater the extent to which one chains thoughts and ideas together , the more likely one is to end up with a worldview that veers from the status quo . Conversely , those with a SMW are more likely to engage in chaining , weaving stories about the past or fantasizing about the future . This is consistent with the notion of an absent - minded professor or a daydreaming student ; such an individual tends to be ‘lost in thought’ as opposed to living in the present moment . However , if something does manage to pull their attention , it tends to be more thoroughly honed before they settle into a particular understanding of it . Shifting Between Analytic and Associative Modes of Thought : Contextual Focus The second uniquely human cognitive ability is posited to have given rise to the ‘big bang’ of human creativity ( Mithen , 1998 ) approximately 60 , 000 years ago . It is referred to as contextual focus ( CF ) because it involves the capacity to adapt ones’ mode of thought to the context by focusing or defocusing attention ( Gabora , 2003 ; Chrusch & Gabora , 2014 ) . CF enabled our ancestors to spontaneously shift between a convergent or analytic mode of thought and a divergent or associative mode of thought , wherein the interconnections between concepts and ideas become more fluid and malleable . Convergent or analytic thought is conducive to mentally demanding analytic tasks ; it stifles associations , and reserves mental effort for symbol manipulation and detecting relationships of causation . Divergent or associative thought , on the other hand , is conducive to mind - wandering , forging new associations when stuck in a rut , and detecting relationships of correlation . While chaining enabled the connecting of closely related items in memory , CF enabled the forging of distant connections . Divergent thought allowed these connections to be glimpsed , and convergent thought enabled them to be polished into their final form . It is interesting to view these forms of thought not just in terms of what they’re good for but in terms of how they process information at the conceptual level , i . e . , the level of concepts . While convergent thought involves using concepts in their most stereotypical , undifferentiated form , i . e . , sticking to their most conventional contexts , divergent thought is characterized by exploring the broader ‘halo’ of potentiality surrounding concepts , i . e . , the new meanings or feelings that arise when concepts are conceived of in particular , often unconventional , contexts ( Gabora , 2018 ) . Divergent thought is a matter of making broad use of contextual information to make associations in constrained ( though potentially obscure ) ways , rather than loosely Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 7 expanding ones’ sphere of associations in a generic sense . Thus , while in a convergent mode of thought you might think of a toothbrush only in terms of its role in brushing teeth , but while puzzling over how to clean a narrow bottle , in a divergent mode of thought you might conceive of a toothbrush as a possible bottle cleaner . CF , like chaining , contributes to the making of a SMW , and does so through the forging of strange and often personal associations . The formation of a SMW entails the ability to not just use both modes of thought , but apply them when needed . As the SMW individual experiences more psychological entropy , there is a greater perceived need for restructuring , and thus a need for CF . When psychological entropy is experienced , creative individuals attempt to mend their fractured worldview by making use of divergent thought , which can forge new connections and come up with ideas . However , since new ideas are born in a divergent mode of thought , they are not likely to be immediately implementable , or even intelligible . Novel ideas and discoveries must be reflected upon or honed from different perspectives in a more clear - headed , convergent mode of thought . In short , the SMW is able to transfer what is discovered in one mode of thought to the other , thereby achieving a more nuanced web of associations . Like chaining , CF has also been modeled using EVOC ( Gabora , Chia , & Firouzi , 2013 ; Gabora & Smith , submitted ) . The mean fitness of actions across EVOC’s artificial society increased with CF , and CF was also particularly effective when the fitness function changed . These findings support CF’s hypothesized usefulness in breaking out of a rut , adapting to new or changing environments , and generating insight . From Task or Problem , to ‘Half - Baked’ Idea , to Creative Output Honing is the process of putting chaining and CF to work in the generation of a creative output . Honing involves viewing something in a new context , which leads to a new take on it , which suggests another new context to consider it from , and so forth , until psychological entropy reaches an adequately low level , the gap is filled , and the worldview is less fragmented ( Gabora , 2017a ) . A more stable image of the world , and one’s own relation to it , comes into focus through immersion in a creative task ( Pelaprat & Cole , 2011 ) . Honing may also utilize imagination : the ability to form internal images or ideas by combining previous knowledge and experience . A SMW is likely to experience cognitive states that feel unclear , ill - defined , and in need of honing , because it is in a process of constant renewal . When a problem ( or task or concept ) is considered in a new way for the first time , it is not always clear how the problem and context fit together . The phrase half - baked idea epitomizes how a creator may not even be able to comprehend their own newly hatched idea . Even so , since the SMW is more likely to have half - baked ideas in the first place , it is more likely to hone them into a state in which they are able to manifest , or take on a life in the outside world . Thus , the more half - baked ideas , the more likely one of them will evolve into something new and useful . Our minds gain a deeper understanding of something , such as a half - baked idea , by looking at it from different perspectives . It is this kind of deep processing and the resulting integrated webs of understanding that make the crucial connections that lead to important advances and innovations ( Gabora , 2017a ) . Encouraging individuals to engage in deeper reflection and understanding is vital to creative thinking , and is particularly important in our society’s high - stimulation environment . Youth spend so much time processing new stimuli that there is less time to venture deep into stimuli they’ve already encountered . With smartphones in hand and a continuous inflow of new content to consume , there is less time for thinking about ideas and situations from different perspectives such that ideas are honed and worldviews become more integrated . Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 8 Insight as Self - Organized Criticality Insight can be experienced as an ‘ aha ! ’ moment and defined as a sudden new representation of a task or a realization of how to go about it ( Mayer , 1995 ) . It is a deliberate cognitive reorganization that concludes in a new and useful interpretation or understanding that is non - obvious , or even peculiar ( Kounios & Beeman , 2009 , 2014 ) . Insight marks a cognitive phase transition ( Stephen , Boncoddo , Magnuson , & Dixon , 2009 ) arising due to self - organized criticality , or SOC ( Gabora , 1998 ) . SOC is a phenomenon wherein , through simple local interactions , complex systems tend to find a critical state—at the cusp of a transition between order and chaos—from which a single minor agitation sometimes exerts a disproportionately large effect ( Bak , Tang , & Weisenfeld , 1988 ) . The signature of SOC is an inverse power law relationship in which most perturbations have little effect , but the occasional perturbation has a dramatic effect . For example , most of our moment - to - moment thoughts are inconsequential , but once in a while one thought triggers another , which triggers another , causing an ‘avalanche’ of reconceptualizations , concluding in a noticeably altered understanding of a concept , i . e . , a moment of insight . Like other SOC systems , a creative mind may function within a system midway between order ( involving the systematic progression of thoughts ) , and chaos ( wherein everything reminds you of everything else ) ( Gabora , 1998 ) . The SMW may make use of CF to stay in this regime , by utilizing systematic analysis when life gets complicated , and letting the mind wander when things get dull . As such , when our learning environments are optimally designed to allow CF to be utilized , SMWs and the creative minds that house them have room to exercise . Some attribute the unpredictability of insight to a blind , sequential , trial - and - error process of idea generation , but insight actually arises through SOC due to the dynamical process of constant change and interaction in SOC systems . This claim is consistent with various lines of evidence across various domains of inquiry . Firstly , insight as SOC corroborates with findings that a series of small conceptual changes is often followed by large - scale creative conceptual change ( Ward , Smith , & Vaid , 1997 ) , and with the fact that worldviews rapidly reconfigure in response to external inputs . It is also consistent with findings that insight tends to come suddenly ( Gick & Lockhart , 1995 ) and with ease ( Topolinski & Reber , 2010 ) , despite often succeeding intensive effort . Evidence that power laws are applicable to novelty transmission is another indication of SOC ( Jacobsen & Guastello , 2011 ) . Further , there is evidence of SOC in the human brain ( Kitzbichler , Smith , Christensen , & Bullmore , 2009 ) , and at the cognitive level . For example , word association studies have shown that concepts are clustered and sparsely connected , with some having many associates and others few ( Nelson , McEvoy , & Schreiber , 2004 ) . Semantic networks exhibit the sparse connectivity , short average path lengths , and strong local clustering that are typical of SOC structures ( Steyvers & Tenenbaum , 2005 ) . A Micro - Level View of the Self - made Worldview Having introduced the concept of a SMW as it manifests at the macro - level of everyday life , let us now briefly examine how a SMW is structured at the micro - level of neuron assemblies . The Birthplace of Creativity The notion of a SMW can be grounded in the brain’s architecture by examining some key attributes of associative memory . First , our memory encoding is sparse ( Kanerva , 1988 ) . This means that the number of possible items that can be encoded is far greater than the number of neurons in the human brain . Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 9 Second , human memories exhibit coarse coding ( Sutton , 1996 ) : they are encoded in neurons that are sensitive to ranges of microfeatures . When memory organization follows coarse coding , a neuron responds maximally to a particular microfeature , and responds to a lesser extent to similar microfeatures . For example , neuron A may respond preferentially to a certain color ( e . g . , pink ) , while its neighbor B responds preferentially to a slightly different color ( e . g . , magenta ) , and so forth . However , although A may respond maximally to pink , it still responds , to a lesser degree , to magenta ( or another similar color ) . The upshot of coarse coding is that an item in memory is distributed across a cell assembly of neurons that are sensitive to particular properties . This means that a given experience activates not just one neuron , nor every neuron to an equal degree , but spreads across an assembly . Thus , the content of an item in memory doesn’t arise due to the activation of any single neuron , but an overall pattern of activation , wherein the same neurons are used and re - used in different capacities ( McClelland , Rumelhart , & Hinton , 2003 ; Edelman , 1987 ) . Distribution guarantees the possibility of forging associations amongst items ( Josselyn , et al . , 2015 ) —whether closely or distantly related—in a potentially new and useful , even surprising , way . Human memory is also content addressable : there is a systematic relationship between stimulus content and the cell assemblies that encode it ( Kanerva , 1988 ) . This enables the brain to take what is being experienced ( i . e . , context ) , and then naturally bring items to mind that are related , in either obvious or unexpected ways . Content addressability ensures that memory items are awakened by stimuli that are similar , or that resonate with one another ( Hebb , 1949 ) . It is often the case that in moments of insight , the correlation between items has never been explicitly noticed , and their overlapping distribution is what awakened this new connection . It is because of these features of memory that we are able to essentially create a new concept , or draw a new connection , that is more appropriate to the situation than anything our brain has ever been fed as input ( McClelland , Rumelhart , & Hinton , 2003 ) . If memory were not sparse , and all neurons were packed like sardines within a small region , then we would not be able to make distinctions across the vast range of stimulus qualities that we can . Without distribution and coarse coding , there would be no overlap between items that share microfeatures , and thus no means of forging associations between them . Without content addressability , these associations would not be appropriate or significant ; we would be wandering blindfolded through memory ( McClelland , Rumelhart , & Hinton , 2003 ) . This cognitive architecture , as well as the compulsion of a SMW to self - organize in response to psychological entropy , is the key to our creativity . Lastly , stored items in memory are never re - experienced in exactly the same form as when first encoded , because the meanings of items are not stored in seclusion , and are in part derived from the meanings of other representations that excite associated groups of neurons . Thus , retrieving a specific , singular memory is essentially impossible and memory does not work through a verbatim retrieval process . Recalled items are inevitably shaped by experiences the individual has had since encoding ( Paterson , Kemp , & Forgas , 2009 ; Schacter , 2001 ) , because the strength and pattern of connections amongst neurons are always changing ( McClelland , 2011 ) . Changing patterns also means that items can spontaneously re - assemble in a way that relates to the task at hand . In this way , a worldview gets restructured . How Chaining is Implemented at the Neural Level At the neural level , the onset of chaining meant that more features of any particular experience were encoded in memory , because more microfeature - specific neurons participated . It follows Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 10 that the proclivity for a SMW may stem from the tendency to encode items in greater detail . Since more details lead to more distinctions , which enable more routes by which one thought can evoke another , this ultimately leads to more possibilities for connecting the dots between past and present experiences . Altogether , chaining and detailed encoding produce a more nuanced worldview . This is why our modern , highly stimulating world , in which classrooms expect efficient , rehearsed answers , may be at a disservice to creative minds—which are born out of attention to detail and thorough investigation . How Contextual Focus is Implemented at the Neural Level Recall , CF is the capacity to effectively tailor one’s mode of the thought to the current situation or context by focusing or defocusing attention ( Gabora , 2003 ) . Analytic thought involves focusing attention and constraining activation such that items are considered in a compact form that is amenable to complex mental operations . Associative thought involves defocusing attention such that obscure , though potentially relevant , aspects of a situation to come into play , and the set of possible associations expands . It has been proposed that the ‘shift’ experienced in CF is carried out through the recruitment and decruitment of neurds ( Gabora , 2010 , 2018 ; Gabora & Ranjan , 2013 ) : the neural assemblies that are not activated in analytic thought , but are in associative thought ( Gabora , 2010 ; see also Ellamil , Dobson , Beeman , & Christoff , 2012 ; Yoruk & Runco , 2014 ) . Neurds respond to properties that are of minimal relevance to the current thought , and thus more distantly associated . The subset of cell assemblies that count as neurds shifts depending on the situation , and so they do not reside in any particular region of memory . Every different perspective one takes toward a particular thought , idea , or concept recruits a different set of neurds . In associative thought , diffuse activation recruits more cell assemblies , including neurds , which enables one thought to stray far from another , while still retaining a thread continuity . Insight occurs when concepts previously assumed to be unrelated are united and sufficiently activated to cross into conscious awareness ( Salvi , Bricolo , Kounios , Bowden , & Beeman , 2016 ) . Following insight , an idea must be honed to completion , which necessitates the shift to an analytic mode of thought . This analytic shift is accomplished by dismissing the cell assemblies that are active during associative thought , i . e . , the decruitment of neurds . An individual is more likely to have a SMW if they utilize CF to tailor their mode of thought to the current situation to a greater extent . Although engagement in associative thought navigates memory both deeply and quickly , the ability to reign it in is as important as the ability to initiate it . If everything always reminds you of everything else all the time , then the ability to draw connections becomes counterproductive . The ability to shift between , and control , both associative and analytic thought enables the structure of one’s worldview to capture not only the contents acquired through social and individual learning , but also how they are all related . These relationships include not only basic - level connections , but relationships with respect to different contexts , and at different levels of abstraction . The Ancestral Origins of New Ideas The fact that associations come to mind spontaneously as a result of representational overlap and shared features means there is no need for memory to be randomly searched to make creative associations ( Gabora , 2010 ) . The more detail with which stimuli and experiences are encoded , the greater their distributed representations overlap , and the more potential routes by which they can act as contexts for one another and combine . Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 11 Let us consider a concrete example . One morning , one of the authors of this chapter awoke from a dream in which she opened a small business basically hauling people around in a bus , and had come up with the slogan , “We put the Bus in Business” . Where on earth did that come from , she wondered . It was obvious , though . It came from a combination of the Sense8 Netflix series she’d been binge - watching in which one of the heros hauls people around in a bus , the dystopian science fiction she’d been reading , and sayings like “We put the Fun in Fundraiser” . You may now have some idea of what caused her mind to pull these things together to generate this weird , new slogan . In the context of wanting to invent a slogan about a ‘bus business’ her dreaming brain didn’t randomly mutate BUSINESS to get , say , “we put the harness in business” ; it immediately hit on something that , albeit silly , is at least relevant ( even when dreaming ! ) . This is consistent with the distributed and content - addressable architecture of memory ; as a result , associations are forged by way of shared structure . The first author’s dreaming mind connected BUS and BUSINESS on the basis of the shared syllable BUS , because they both activate neurds that are tuned to respond to the features of this syllable . Having examined how new ideas emerge in associative memory , it is clear that they do not ‘arise out of the blue’ ; they bear some relationship to knowledge and experiences encoded in memory before the creative act took place . Thus , due to the organization of memory , insight is not simply a matter of chance or expertise , but of becoming newly aware of the shared features between memories and concepts . The Evolution of Creative Worldviews To understand the mystery that is creativity , we must assess where creativity fits into the ‘big picture’ of humanity . Humans uniquely participate in two evolutionary processes : biological and cultural . Within this second cultural evolutionary process creativity is the driving force that enables cultural outputs to proliferate without limits ( Gabora , 1997 ) . Although it may at first seem possible that culture , like biological organisms , could evolve through a Darwinian process ( of natural selection or ‘survival of the fittest’ ) , there is abundant theoretical and empirical evidence against a Darwinian framework for culture ( Gabora , 2004 , 2006 , 2011 , 2013 ) . Even very early life itself went through a stage where it evolved—i . e . , exhibited cumulative , adaptive , open - ended change—through a process that functioned rather differently from natural selection . What made early biological evolution possible was the emergence of protocells : simple cell - like structures that were self - organizing , self - mending , communally interacting , and self - reproducing ( Hordijk , Hein , & Steel , 2010 ; Kauffman , 1993 ) . It has been shown that these protocells evolved through a more haphazard process referred to as communal exchange , which involved interactions not just within but amongst these self - organizing structures ( Vetsigian , Woese , & Goldenfeld , 2006 ) . It has been proposed that what made cultural evolution possible is the emergence of mind or worldview that is self - organizing , self - mending , communally interacting , and self - reproducing ( Gabora , 2013 ) . In short , the protocell is to biological evolution what the worldview is to cultural evolution . The internal state of the worldview changes dynamically due to a communal exchange of information with the external world , just like the earliest forms of life . By sharing experiences , ideas , and attitudes with others , individuals can influence the process by which another worldview may form and transform . One of the earliest environments that expose us to sharing through communal exchange is the classroom , where there is endless potential for unique interactions to take place . But if teaching methods follow strict , traditional guidelines in this early environment , then peer interaction may be discouraged , or at least overlooked , during the learning process , thus stifling the sharing and questioning of ideas that construct SMWs . Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 12 When people directly or indirectly interact with and make impressions on one another , their worldview’s configuration can be passed on by influencing and being imperfectly reconstituted others . For example , students may expose fragments of what was originally their parent’s or teacher’s worldview according to the student’s own unique experiences and physical limitations , thereby forging unique internal models of the relationship between self and world . Thus , worldviews are not just communally interacting , but also self - regenerating . However , there is no universal ‘self - assembly code’ ( e . g . , DNA ) that ensures the reliability of replication ( as in biology ) . Consequently , particular beliefs or ideas may take on a different role within various worldviews as a result of the experiences and structures unique to that particular individual . A worldview is more likely to unfold into a SMW if it is exposed to more social and environmental interactions and experiences , thus encoding more information and having more potential configurations . Therefore , a worldview evolves through communal exchange by interweaving both ( 1 ) internal interactions amongst its parts , and ( 2 ) external interactions with others ; a SMW does this to a greater extent . When creativity is viewed in light of its role in fueling cultural evolution , the proposal of insight as self - organized criticality ( SOC ) fits into a broader conceptual framework . According to the theory of punctuated equilibrium , for which there is substantial well - documented evidence , changes in biological species are restricted to rare , rapid events interspersed amongst prolonged periods of stasis ( Eldridge & Gould , 1972 ) . Punctuated equilibrium is perhaps the best - known example of SOC in nature , and it has been suggested that cultural evolution , like biological evolution , exhibits punctuated equilibrium ( Orsucci , 2008 ) . Insight may play the role in cultural evolution that punctuated equilibrium plays in biological evolution , fueling the reorganization of , not species in an ecosystem , but concepts and ideas in an ‘ecology of mind’ . One of the more prominent implications of applying communal exchange to cultural evolution is that it is not the creative artifacts or ideas that are evolving , but the worldviews that produce them ( Gabora , 2004 ) . Creative outputs are , in as sense , the byproducts of evolving worldviews . Since a worldview cannot be seen , it reveals itself through behavioural consistencies in social interaction and through generating creative outputs ( Gabora , 2017a ) . For example , when students debate about politics , or present their art projects to each other , these interactions and outputs are what allow worldviews to view and shape one another . The Role of Education Just as the cumulative creativity of biological evolution completely transformed our planet , the cumulative creativity of cultural evolution is completely transforming our planet . Although the creative processes underlying cultural evolution may be more strategic—i . e . , less random—than biological evolution , we still cannot predict where its headed . While we have made considerable headway in understanding how the creative process works , we are no better able to predict the next new gadget that will captivate us nor the next novel that will move us to tears . Thus , we cannot predict the world that today’s students will have to navigate once they graduate . We can , however , educate them to be , not compilations of knowledge and social rules , but SMWs , able to weave what they are told into a unique cognitive structure of their own making that reflects their unique proclivities and experiences . This means that providing opportunities not just to learn but to explore how what they are learning could relate to personal experiences and knowledge in other domains . In this time of not just unprecedented cultural change but change to the planet that sustains us , it is crucial that we educate students to be able to creatively respond to perturbations and cope with the unexpected . Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 13 Although teachers claim to value creativity , many hold negative attitudes toward the attributes associated with it , as many fear that encouraging creativity in the classroom could lead to chaos ( Beghetto , 2007 ) . Teachers tend to emphasize correct responses and the regurgitation of knowledge at the expense of creativity , as such a framework allows for more straightforward evaluation . Creative projects and testing , on the other hand , take considerable effort and result in minimal benefits to standardized testing . Then , when efforts are made to encourage creativity within an educational setting , neither teacher nor students often knows what the expectations are . However , despite the risks of encouraging creative classrooms , such an investment in education is critically important and potentially rewarding ( Ranjan & Gabora , 2012 ) . What is essential to the challenges of our future is of course innovative products and ideas , but also a world where the type of people inhabiting it have benefitted from the creative process . This notion of potentiality applies not just to concepts but also to students . Each student can be seen as a unique wellspring of creative potentiality , which the teacher can help actualize , or bring to fruition . Just as exploring the ‘halo’ of potentiality surrounding ideas and concepts can lead to new , unexpected perspectives and associations , the thoughts and ideas of a student— as he or she interacts with a teacher , particular lesson , or approach to teaching it—can potentially follow new , creative trajectories . Allowing the full - ranging exploration of a student’s potentiality affords the possibility of new emergent outcomes that could not be predicted in a straightforward logical way from knowledge of the teacher , student , or lesson plan ( Ranjan & Gabora , 2012 ) . Cultivating Creativity in the Classroom An obvious final question to address is : how can creativity be nurtured in an educational setting ? Incorporating creativity into the classroom may appear challenging and counterproductive , given that the current system is rooted in a certain structure , but there are a multitude of ways to do so ( see Gregerson , Kaufman & Snyder , 2013 ) . The following section outlines three key ways in which teachers can begin to incorporate creativity ( Gabora , 2017b ) . First , it is essential to focus less on the reproduction of information and more on critical thinking and problem solving . Doing so allows students to build the necessary skills to engage in CF , wherein associative thought processes allow them to traverse their minds for ideas , and then analytic thought refines what is found . As discussed above , CF is an important brick in the foundation of a SMW . Incorporating this is as simple as using open - ended written questions as opposed to multiple choice questions on exams , or at least having a mixture . For example , presenting a real - world scenario and then following up with a question that requires using knowledge learned in class , as well as critical thinking and reflective skills . Second , teachers can curate activities that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries , such as by painting murals that depict biological food chains , or acting out plays about historical events , or writing poems about the cosmos . After all , the world doesn’t come carved up into different subject areas . If our culture and classrooms tell students that these disciplinary boundaries are real , then their thinking becomes trapped in them . In reality , harsh lines do not exist between various domains in life , as the products of any creative act ( be it writing a song or solving a math problem ) are not the core elements of cultural evolution , but the ever - changing worldviews are . A worldview that is dynamic and creative may be reflected in a student who is capable of both building a beautiful diorama of a cell body and correctly labelling all of the parts . Third , by posing questions and challenges , and then following up with opportunities for solitude and reflection , teachers can provide time and space for more detailed contemplation . In the current high - stimulation environment that students are exposed to daily , classrooms have the potential to offer a place for deeper reflection and understanding . Reflecting upon what is Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 14 learned or asked fosters the forging of new connections that is so vital to creativity . While time - constraints may lead students to produce uncreative answers that reflect what they’ve been told , allowing time for information to ‘incubate’ may cultivate more creative outputs that showcase what students have done with what they’ve been told . It may be especially helpful for teachers or professors to view their students as entities that are able to rehash and reflect upon learned information , put their own spin on it , and later , do something novel with it ( Ranjan & Gabora , 2012 ) . These types of people are more likely to end up with a creative SMW . A Creative Assignment in Practice To make the above suggestions more concrete , let us walk you through an example of a university classroom assignment ( from Ranjan & Gabora , 2012 ) —aspects of which could be made to suit a younger group , as well . At the beginning of the term , students are asked to choose to complete a presentation , essay , or project , which is due at the end of the term . Students may choose their own topic , but it must pertain to a major theme or subject of the course . By giving students a choice of format and topic , plus the entire term to work on it , they can discover and explore their own interests and talents in - depth , and mull over the assignment from day one . Although it may be difficult to initially generate a topic , the time allowance means that a student can engage in associative thought and connect their own curiosity and abilities with what has been learned in class . In this associate stage of idea - generation , one thought is able to stray far from the next , yet a thread continuity is still retained by the subject or topic ( e . g . , politics or biology ) , keeping even far - reaching ideas somewhat relevant to the assignment . Once some half - baked ideas are conjured up , analytic thought constrains the student’s flight of ideas so that they can choose which one best fits the course content and will produce a learning experience tailored to the students’ interests . Here , students are learning to engage in CF and use it to their advantage . Since creativity thrives in situations where both freedom and constraint coexist , for an open - ended task such as this , instructors can ensure that students have clear expectations by both providing examples and breaking up the assignment into multiple steps . For example , they could be asked to submit just the title , one sentence , and one reference two weeks after the start of class , then submit one paragraph one month after the start of class , ( and so forth ) , with feedback provided at each stage . In this way , students have lots of opportunity to hone and revise their ideas , and fulfill their creative potential . This assignment incorporates ( 1 ) focusing on critical thinking and problem solving , ( 2 ) posing questions and challenges followed by opportunities for solitude , reflection , and detailed contemplation . It could also potentially incorporate ( 3 ) activities that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries ; for example , students might respond to this kind of open - ended assignment by creating a video game that explores the laws of physics , or by writing a short story about someone with a psychological disorder . Studies on conceptual combinations suggest that because more ambiguous tasks such as this offer more opportunities to for students to connect dissimilar concepts , they may result in more creative outputs ( Wilkenfeld & Ward , 2001 ) . When students choose their own topics , they are more likely to be intrinsically motivated , and to find personal meaning in what they are learning . Giving them several months to carry out the assignment , and staggering it into sub - goals , encourages students to put more of themselves into their work , which , and provides sufficient time for half - baked ideas to crystallize into final creative products that students can feel proud of . Although some skills may be specific to particular domains ( e . g . , multiplication ability is more specific to math than literature ) , creative processes of the kind that may be Maland & Gabora / Dynamic Perspectives on Creativity 15 engendered by such open - ended assignments may catalyze internal transformation that transcends such boundaries . Conclusion Although educators claim to value creativity , a disconnect exists between this claim and what actually happens in school . This is likely because traditional misconceptions and assumptions about creativity keep educators from effectively incorporating it in their syllabi . Thus , the aim of this chapter was to thoroughly introduce a new conception of the creative mind as a complex , dynamical system that begins with worldviews . The ideas proposed here paint creativity as not being domain - specific , and as not measurable by tangible creative outputs . Creativity can be explored as much in chemistry as it is in graphic design , as the real transformation that takes place is internal . Understanding what a creative worldview looks like and how it is different , is the necessary first step in exploring practical applications . We believe that no other investment in education could be more important and potentially rewarding than encouraging this understanding and thus encouraging creative classrooms . By nurturing the skills and attributes characteristic of creative minds , education systems have the potential to cultivate the kinds of people that society needs .
