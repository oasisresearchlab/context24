International Business & Economics Research Journal – May / June 2015 Volume 14 , Number 3 Copyright by author ( s ) ; CC - BY 407 The Clute Institute Crowdfunding : The Current State Of Research Ricarda B . Bouncken , University of Bayreuth , Germany Malvine Komorek , Lappeenranta University of Technology , Finland Sascha Kraus , University of Liechtenstein , Liechtenstein ABSTRACT Crowdfunding represents an alternative way of funding compared to traditional borrowing . As a principle , crowdfunding is open to everyone - private persons as well as economic actors . A group of people , the crowd , financially contributes small amounts to projects , products or ideas . These projects , products or ideas are owned by fundraisers ( e . g . entrepreneurs or private persons ) , seeking for money in order to get their project realized . Fundraisers search for investors directly or via a specific digital platform , referred to as intermediaries . Crowdfunding represents a recent web 2 . 0 based phenomenon gaining more and more scientific attention . Therefore , this article seeks to give an overview on the current state of scientific knowledge on the topic , summarizing core definitions as well as characteristics . Keywords : Crowdfunding ; Literature Review ; Status Quo INTRODUCTION rowdfunding , as the contribution of a financial amount to projects , products or business ideas by a number of investors ( Wenzlaff et al . , 2012 ) , has recently emerged as an alternative possibility for individuals to receive funding ( Agrawal et al . , 2013 ; Kleeman et al . , 2008 ; Unterberg , 2010 ) . The concept of mobilizing funding in small pieces is old and can be found in every incorporation ( Fiedler and Horsch , 2014 ; Harrisson , 2013 ; Zademach and Baumeister , 2013 ) . Contrary to typical financial investments , crowdfunding is fundamentally open to everyone ( Blohm et al . , 2013 ; Wenzlaff et al . , 2012 ) . Originally , the concept gained prominence with the financing of artists or creative projects and then spread across more sectors ( Bradford , 2012 ; Meinshausen et al . , 2012 ) . As statistics emphasize , crowdfunding is rapidly growing . US $ 2 . 7 billion were contributed with over a million different crowdfunding incentives in 2012 . By 2013 , this amount increased over 51 % to US $ 5 . 1 billion ( Massolution , 2013 ) . Therefore , it represents a highly discussed topic on a global basis in younger media ( e . g . Spiegel Online , 2014 ) but also scientific articles since 2010 ( Moritz and Block , 2014 ) . Crowdfunding is a web 2 . 0 based phenomenon ( Leimeister , 2012 ) . Crucial factor for success of the concept is the digitalization of society with growing presence of the internet . The number of internet users increased up to almost 570 % between 2000 and 2012 ( Internet World Stats , 2013 ) . Today , markets are growingly saturated with digital equipments and accounts ( Stalder , 2009 ) . People are able to communicate , access and provide information constantly ( Castells , 2009 ; Wolf et al . , 2012 ) . As a recent development , people are willing to also contribute and give , fostering the rapid development of crowdfunding since about five years ( Aaker and Akutsu , 2009 ) . This paper seeks to contribute to scientific research on crowdfunding , giving an overview on fundamental findings concerning crowdfunding . The content of this paper is based on a comprehensive literature review of scientific publications on crowfunding from the period 2000 to 2014 . A database search using the University of Leicester Online Library , Web of Science ( Thomson Reuters ) , and EBSCO ( EconLit , Business Source Premier , Academic Search Premier , Science Direct , Emerald Management Xtra , and the Web of Science ( Social Sciences Citation Index ) ) resulted in usable texts . In August 2014 , a search request on Web of Science ( Thomson Reuters ) with " crowdfunding " as well as " crowd funding " in title search , added up to usable of peer - group reviewed studies . The selection and identification of relevant publications was conducted with certain key words ( including C International Business & Economics Research Journal – May / June 2015 Volume 14 , Number 3 Copyright by author ( s ) ; CC - BY 408 The Clute Institute crowdfunding , crowd funding and crowdfinancing ) in their titles and / or abstracts . The systematic literature review was conducted following the approach by Tranfield et al . ( 2003 ) , the studies were analyzed and classified due to their validity and their content as a contribution to the scientific discipline . This article focuses on key aspects of scientific research on crowdfunding . It is structured as follows : Subsequent to the introduction , existing definitions will be presented . Additional focal areas of research like the economic basis of crowdfunding ( two - sided - market ) , crowdfunding models , direct vs . indirect crowdfunding as well as the different actors involved in the crowdfunding process will be presented . An outlook on future research and a conclusion will finalize this work . REVIEW Definitions Crowdfunding represents one dimension of the phenomenon of crowdsourcing besides crowdvoting and crowdcreation ( e . g . Leimeister , 2012 ; Leimeister and Zogaj , 2013 ; Richter et al . , 2014 ) . The term crowdsourcing is composed of " crowd " and " outsourcing " , pointing to the meaning to outsource specific functions to a group of external persons ( Kleeman et al . , 2008 ) . The concept is based on the idea of " wisdom of a crowd " ( Surowiecki , 2004 ) . It represents an approach being in a juvenile state of scientific research ( Howe , 2008 ) . Jeff Howe ( 2006a ; 2006b ; 2008 ) was the first to define crowdsourcing in an online article in 2006 . Up to today , his definition remains the most prominent scientific one , which we therefore follow ( Brabham , 2009 ; Starbird , 2012 ) . The act of taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent ( usually an employee ) and outsourcing it to an undefined , generally large of people in the form of an open call . ( Howe , 2006b , p . 1 ) Besides crowdsourcing ( Howe , 2008 ) , crowdfunding is closely connected to micro lending ( Vitale , 2013 ) . Micro lending refers to the the idea of funding of individuals , who do not have access to conventional financing from credit institutions ( Armendariz and Morduch , 2010 ) . As for crowdsourcing , various definitions of crowdfunding exist of which none did receive overall scientific acceptance ( e . g . Tomczak and Brem , 2013 ) . Therefore , prominent existing definitions will be presented in the following table : International Business & Economics Research Journal – May / June 2015 Volume 14 , Number 3 Copyright by author ( s ) ; CC - BY 409 The Clute Institute Table 1 : Definitions Of Crowdfunding Authors Definition Belleflamme et al . , 2010 , p . 5 Crowdfunding involves an open call , essentially through the Internet , for the provision of financial resources either in form of donation or in exchange for some form of reward and / or voting rights . Fiedler and Horsch , 2014 , p . 92 Crowdfunding comprises forms of capital supply , with which capital seeking companies publicly present themselves on specific internet based platforms to a big group of potential capital providers based on their innovative business idea and offer this group the opportunity to engage themselves with the allocation of funding ( translated from German ) . Hemer et al . , 2011 , p 5 Crowdfunding is a form of project and innovation funding with micropayments ( translated from German ) . Lambert and Schwienbacher , 2010 , p . 4 An open call , essentially through the Internet , for the provision of financial resources either in form of donation or in exchange for some form of reward and / or voting rights in order to support initiatives for specific purposes . Tomczak and Brem , 2013 , p . 338 The act of taking a loan / funding traditionally performed by a designated agent and outsourcing it to an undefined , generally large group of people in the form of an open call . Voorbraak , 2011 , p . 1 The process of one party requesting and receiving money and other resources from many individuals for financing a project , in exchange for monetary or non - monetary return on investment . Wenzlaff et al . , 2012 , n . p . Crowdfunding is a type of fundraising for creative projects , but also for companies . Most important aspect is , that crowdfunding is open , uses the methods of web 2 . 0 for communication and has usually a type of material or immaterial rewarding ( translated from German ) . Bottom line of all definitions from numerous authors is , that crowdfunding focuses on raising financial funding from the public , represented by a group of people , by using specific internet - based platforms ( e . g . Mazzola and Distefano , 2010 ; Ribiere and Tuggle , 2010 ; Yang et al . , 2008 ) . Crowdfunding As A Two - Sided Market Crowdfunding is regarded as a typical two - sided market as it " ties together two distinct groups of users in a network " ( Eisenmann et al . , 2006 , p . 2 ) . Two - sided networks are characterized by a subsidy - side and a money - side . The subsidy - side is the group of investors contributing to the money - side , the fundraiser , while paying no fees to the platform ( e . g . Osterwalder and Pigneur , 2010 ) . Intermediaries charge different amounts to fundraisers while investors are not charged separate fees ( e . g . Indiegogo , 2014 ; Kickstarter , 2014 ) . Crowdfunding Models The dimensions of crowdfunding differentiate in terms of the allocation of resources and the reflux to investors ( e . g . Moritz and Block , 2014 ; Zhang , 2013 ) . In general , participants in the crowd can be rewarded in different ways : material ( Vukovic et al . , 2009 ) or immaterial via social acknowledgement ( Kazai , 2011 ) . Materially , the compensation can be monetarily as the project initiators agree to refund the paid amount directly or indirectly with products or services ( Pelzer et al . , 2012 ) . Overall four models in terms of financing do exist ( e . g . Beck , 2012 ; Giudici et al . , 2012 ; Leimeister , 2012 ) . Scholars divide crowdfunding into a donations , reward , lending and equity model . The donations model refers to a classic fundraising objective with the difference that the donations are made via web 2 . 0 and , in most cases , a specific intermediary . Donators receive no material but immaterial , social rewarding in return for their contributions - e . g . public acknowledgements by the fundraisers ( Leimeister and Zogaj , 2013 ) . For the realization of creative projects , the donations model is commonly applied . It is also regarded as a rising opportunity for public institutions , such as libraries , to be financially funded by the crowd ( McKinley , 2012 ) . The only immaterial rewarding represents an option for investors to take part in " real - world problems " ( Wiggins and Crowston , 2011 , p . 1 ) with their engagement in the crowd . The reward model includes both , material and immaterial rewarding . For crowdsponsoring investors are solely rewarded via acknowledgements ( intersection to the donations model ) as their name might appear in the International Business & Economics Research Journal – May / June 2015 Volume 14 , Number 3 Copyright by author ( s ) ; CC - BY 410 The Clute Institute funded project ( Belleflamme et al . , 2013 ; Kortleben and Vollmar , 2012 ) . In pre - selling or also pre - ordering , rewarding is materially based as investors receive the financed project or product before publication or market entrance ( Hemer et al . , 2011 ; Röthler and Wenzlaff , 2011 ) . Small loans are given in the lending model . Investors receive a fixed interest rate in this case . These kinds of contracts can either be made between private persons when a private investors finances a private fundraiser ( Peer - to - Peer - Lending ) ( Hemer et al . , 2011 ; Kaltenbeck , 2011 ; Kortleben and Vollmar , 2012 ) , or from private persons to companies ( Barasinka and Schäfer , 2010 ; Mach et al . , 2013 ) . The equity model comprises a fundraising via selling shares of the fundraised company to the crowd . This is especially in the german - speeking area often described as crowdinvesting ( e . g . Leimeister and Zogaj , 2013 ; Hornuf and Klöhn , 2013 ) or " investment crowdfunding " ( Barnett , 2013 , p . 1 ) , when start - ups and entrepreneurs receive money from the crowd and bridge early stage gaps in funding ( Mollick , 2013 ) . Investors receive a profit sharing as a material reward ( Beck , 2012 ; Brem and Wassong , 2014 ) . This model has received highest scientific attention in the past ( e . g . Moritz and Block , 2014 ) . Direct vs . Indirect Crowdfunding Crowdfunding can be divided into direct and indirect crowdfunding . Direct crowdfunding refers to a direct funding appeal from fundraisers to the crowd , e . g . on the website of the company . Indirect crowdfunding involves an intermediary in the crowdfunding process as the appeal is announced via a specific platform ( Belleflamme et al . , 2010 ; Burkett , 2011 ; Lambert and Schwienbacher , 2010 ) . What makes direct crowdfunding less advantageous for unknown fundraisers ( e . g . entrepreneurs ) is the fact , that they would directly have to be able to address a large number of people via their own website . No required minimum number of participants in the crowd could be found in the current state of literature on the topic . However , Howe ( 2006a ; 2006b ; 2008 ) claimed a size of 5 . 000 participants in a crowd to be decisive for a successful crowdfunding campaign . This number seems to be calculated too high since famous crowdfunding platforms state an maximum average of 500 to 600 participants ( Crowdcube , 2014 ; Kickstarter , 2014 ; Seedmatch , 2014 ) . Still , most crowdfunding is conducted in reality indirectly via an intermediary which is emphasized by a growing number of crowdfunding platforms ( e . g . Moritz and Block , 2014 ) . Actors Involved In Crowdfunding Three different kinds of actors are involved in typical crowdfunding : intermediaries , fundraisers and investors ( Tomczak and Brem , 2013 ) . Intermediaries First , the intermediary , as the internet - based platform , takes an important role in connecting and matching fundraisers and investors ( Zvilichovsky et al . , 2013 ) . Intermediaries ensure standardized crowdfunding processes for the investors and serve as a platform for communication , information and execution at the same time . Close communication between fundraiser and investor is important in order to receive a successful funding of the incentive ( Brabham , 2009 ; Estellés - Arolas and González - Ladrón - de - Guevara , 2012 ; Howe , 2006b ) . Intermediaries follow different investment models ( Barnett , 2013 ) . All - or - nothing implies that the fundraiser only receives the amount if a previously defined threshold of investments is reached whereas fundraisers receive all investments in the keep - what - you - get model ( e . g . Mahlstede , 2012 ; Moritz and Block , 2014 ) . Intermediaries vary in their focus . Specific platforms for creative projects ( indiegogo or RocketHub ) , organizational and corporate projects ( Crowdfunder ) or fundraising ( Crowdrise , 2aid , Betterplace ) ( Grimme Institut , 2012 ; Wheat et al . , 2013 ) do exist . Main fields of application of crowdfunding platforms are acquisition of contents , design & improvement , sales & marketing as well as research & development ( Kaganer et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , platforms of social networking are of relevance since crowdfunding projects are communicated on them . Facebook or twitter serve can serve as a promoter of crowdfunding incentives ( Belleflamme et al . , 2011 ) . The social support is of specific importance for fundraising ( Wheat et al . , 2013 ) . International Business & Economics Research Journal – May / June 2015 Volume 14 , Number 3 Copyright by author ( s ) ; CC - BY 411 The Clute Institute Fundraisers Second , fundraisers comprise the individuals , seeking for funding . Crowdfunding provides them access to a market on one hand while raising money on the other hand ( Burkett , 2011 ) . As crowdfunding is fundamentally open , the typology of fundraisers can vary from companies ( Burger - Helmchen and Penin , 2010 ) , industries ( Grier , 2011 ) , institutions ( Howe , 2006a ) or non - profit organizations ( Brabham , 2009 ) . Currently , scientific research has focused primarily on companies as fundraisers ( Moritz and Block , 2014 ) . Requirements to be fulfilled by the fundraiser in order to initate a crowdfunding project are minor ( Estellés - Arolas and González - Ladrón - de - Guevara , 2012 ) as the self - marketing of the fundraisers idea is referred to as the most important requirement ( Pelzer et al . , 2012 ) . To start a crowdfunding project , fundraisers have to apply to the platform with detailed information on the project or to the company ( e . g . Belleflamme et al . , 2011 ) . The platform then decides on publishing the project or declining it . Scholars identified different motivations for participating in crowdfunding . The primary focus of fundraisers is to receive funding whereas raising awareness as well as feedback on the project , product or business idea is less important . Kleeman et al . ( 2008 ) state a growing importance of the feedback aspect as customers gain more and more influence on the value added process . Crowdinvesting for start - ups offers entrepreneurs the possibility to bridge the early - stage - gap in which conservative funding is not possible ( Hemer et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , access to the knowledge of the crowd is provided while duties towards investors remain minor ( Surowiecki , 2004 ) . At the same time , the base of potential customers is increased which , empirically confirmed , leads to higher sales . Market potential can be more efficiently exploited ( Belleflamme et al . , 2010 ) . The characteristics of the fundraisers influences the chance for a project to be successfully funded ( Moritz and Block , 2014 ) . Investors contribute to projects they want so see realized ( Belleflamme et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , non - profit organizations or socially focused companies are more likely to be supported by investors than others ( Belleflamme et al . , 2010 ) . An additional success factor is the period of funding and the amount . Usually , crowdfunding incentives are limited to a certain period between 30 and 90 days ( Mahlstede , 2012 ) . The proximity of a realization of the crowdfunding incentive depends on the time period of the incentive as well as the requested amount of funding . The longer the time period and the higher the requested amount , the lower will be the proximity of the crowdfunding incentive to receive full funding . Investors Third and last , investors represent the crowd , who " [ . . . ] decide to financially support these projects , bearing a risk and expecting a certain payoff " ( Ordanini et al . , 2011 , p . 5 ) . These investors are in terms of indirect crowdfunding registered users with access to the project information ( e . g . Baba et al . , 2014 ) . In case of interest , investors contribute a fixed amount via a bank or micopayment provider . The crowd , as a group of recipients of the task , usually stays anonymous regarding crowd and the fundraiser ( s ) ( Poetz and Schreier , 2009 ; Wexler , 2011 ) . Investors are intelligent , qualified persons ( Howe , 2008 ) . A necessary qualification in order to take part in crowdfunding as an investor is not determined : users and consumers ( Kleeman et al . , 2008 ) , amateurs ( Schenk and Guittard , 2011 ) or individuals , seeking for commitment ( Grier , 2011 ; Heer and Bostok , 2010 ) are regarded as members of the crowd . The crowdwork can either be tournament - based or collaboration - based ( Leimeister , 2012 ) . The primary focus on the crowd needs to be the collaborative funding of the incentive instead of aiming to individually work on a solution ( Howe , 2006a ) . For crowdsourcing in general , these social effects are comprised by terms such as " crowd wisdom " ( Brabham , 2009 , p . 248 ; see also Leimeister , 2012 , p . 388 ) or " collaborative knowledge " ( Pelzer et al . , 2012 , p . 20 ) . Social reputation and intrinsic motives represent the main impetus for investors to participate in crowdfunding , extrinsic motives such as financial rewarding are less relevant ( e . g . Lambert and Schwienbacher , 2010 ; Richter et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the identification with the incentive , project or company , represents a crucial factor ( e . g . Eickhoff and De Vries , 2011 ) . In most cases , investors are particularly motivated to fund when they regard the quality of the incentive as high ( e . g . Mollick , 2013 ) . Currently , the IT - developer Chris Roberts is seeking International Business & Economics Research Journal – May / June 2015 Volume 14 , Number 3 Copyright by author ( s ) ; CC - BY 412 The Clute Institute for contributions for his new computer game " star citizen " . As an appetizer , potential investors can log on a virtual platform to receive first insights in the computer game ( Spiegel Online , 2014 ) . Social networks influence the motivation of investors in addition ( Lawton and Marom , 2010 ) . When the number of investors in an incentive rises , other potential investors react with lower investments since they expect the incentive to be fully funded . As a result , the number of investor freezes or decreases and motivates the investors to finally contribute as they want to ensure the realization of the incentive ( e . g . Smith et al . , 2013 ) . CONCLUSIONS The research field of crowdfunding is in a young state of scientific research . Quantitative studies are minor . Former studies focus on crowdfunding models as well as on the role of the actors in the process : intermediaries , fundraisers and investors . Previously , studies focused on companies as fundraisers ( e . g . Brem and Wassong , 2014 ; Mollick , 2013 ; Tomczak and Brem , 2013 ) . In terms of theoretical foundations , no consensus on definitions , dimensions or characteristics does exist . There is no detailed literature analysis , giving a generic overview on the state of research on crowdfunding . Three literature reviews could be identified . Bachmann et al . ( 2011 ) focus on peer - to - peer lending only while Feller et al . ( 2013 ) analyze crowdfunding quantitatively in terms of dimensions . Moritz and Block ( 2014 ) focus on literature on early - stage funding primarily . As the numbers of intermediaries are rising rapidly , the crowdfunding movement is continuously developing ( Mahlstede , 2012 ) . As a result , scientific contributions are continuously challenged by new developments . Constantly new research is needed . Currently , crowdfunding is primarily regarded from a positive perspective as an alternative opportunity to receive funding . Limits and challenges of the approach received less scientific attention in the past and should be illuminated in the future .
