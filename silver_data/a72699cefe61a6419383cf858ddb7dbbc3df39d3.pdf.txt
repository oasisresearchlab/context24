In the post - pandemic - era , we must remain vigilant against the co - infection of SARS - CoV - 2 and other respiratory viruses . More accurate and convenient detection methods are required for the diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 due to its prolonged existence . In this study , the application value of a novel lyophilized - pellet - based 2019 - nCoV nucleic acid diagnostic kit ( PCoV - Kit ) was evaluated by comparing it with a conventional liquid diagnostic kit ( LCoV - Kit ) . We assessed the sensitivity , precision , accuracy , specificity , and amplification effi - ciency of PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit using diluted SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference materials . The results showed that both kits had high sensitivity , precision , accuracy , and specificity . A total of 2 , 033 oropharyngeal swab specimens collected during mass screening in Fuzhou in December 2022 were applied for the consistency analysis of the two reagents . In the detec - tion of clinical oropharyngeal swab specimens , although the positive rate of PCoV - Kit ( 19 . 28 % ) was slightly lower than that of LCoV - Kit ( 20 . 86 % ) , statistical analysis demon - strated a high degree of consistency between the test results obtained using both kit ( χ 2 = 1 . 57 , P > 0 . 05 ; Kappa coefficient = 0 . 90 , 95 % CI : 0 . 88 – 0 . 93 ) . In conclusion , the use of lyophi - lized PCoV - Kit provides a non - inferior assay for the diagnosis of COVID - 19 . Introduction In the past three years , coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , caused by severe acute respira - tory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , created an unprecedented crisis for global public health and safety [ 1 ] .

Accurate , rapid , reliable , and convenient diagnosis tests are crucial for the control and treat - ment of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Laboratory assays for diagnosing SARS - CoV - 2 infection include nucleic acid amplification testing ( NAAT ) , antigen tests , and serologic testing [ 2 ] . NAAT and antigen tests are generally used for early detection for SARS - CoV - 2 infection around the time of symptom onset , while serologic testing is used 3 weeks after infection for surveillance purposes [ 3 , 4 ] . As reported in a network meta - analysis of diagnostic test accuracy , NAAT had a sensitivity of 0 . 93 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 88 – 0 . 96 ) and specificity of 0 . 98 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 97 – 0 . 99 ) , while antigen testing would lead to higher false negatives ( sensitivity of 0 . 75 , 0 . 70 – 0 . 79 ; speci - ficity of 0 . 98 , 0 . 97 – 0 . 99 ) [ 5 ] . NAAT method contains reverse - transcriptase ploymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) and isothermal nucleic acid amplification ( NAA ) [ 2 ] . RT - PCR is consid - ered to be the gold standard [ 6 ] . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 has gradually increased on the rise due to its ongoing mutations [ 7 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 is predicted to coexist with humans for an extended period of time [ 8 ] . Studies indicated that SARS - CoV - 2 fre - quently co - infected with influenza viruses , respiratory syncytial virus , adenoviruses , or dengue virus , leading to more severe clinical symptoms and an increase in mortality [ 9 , 10 ] . Since SARS - CoV - 2 infection shares overlapping clinical symptoms with other viral infections men - tioned above , accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in guiding clinical treatments [ 9 ] . Currently , the commonly used RT - PCR reagents are liquid reagents requiring fresh prepara - tion , which possesses several drawbacks : ( i ) liquid reagents require strict cold chain transporta - tion and storage , ( ii ) repeated freeze - thaw cycles can lead to the degradation of DNA or the inactivation of amplification enzyme , ( iii ) mistakes in final concentration or pipetting errors during reaction mix preparation may result in inaccurate and delayed results [ 11 , 12 ] . In con - trast , ready - to - use lyophilized reagents simplify the transportation and storage requirements and minimize user interference , making them a more cost - effective and convenient option for diagnosis purposes . It has previously been demonstrated that the lyophilized reagents are reli - able and accurate detection reagents in the diagnosis of chikungunya virus , Rift Valley fever phlebovirus , foot - and - mouth disease virus , and avian influenza viruses [ 12 – 15 ] . In this study , we compared a a novel lyophilized - pellet - based 2019 - nCoV nucleic acid diag - nostic kit ( PCoV - Kit ) with a widely used commercial liquid diagnostic kit ( LCoV - Kit ) , assess - ing its sensitivity , precision , accuracy , amplification efficiency , and specificity . In addition , we evaluated the consistency of the two reagents in detecting clinical specimens . Material and methods Reagents The following reagents were used in this study : SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference material ( Guang - zhou BDS Biological Technology , China , Cat . # BDS - BW - 117 ) ; 2019 - nCoV - RNA liquid inter - nal quality control ( Guangzhou BDS Biological Technology , China , Cat . # BDS - IQC - 304 ) ; sample preservation solution ( CapitalBio Technology , China , Cat . # 3010202033 ) ; nucleic acid ( DNA / RNA ) extraction or purification kit ( Sansure Biotech , China , Cat . # SE40015 ) ; novel coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) nucleic acid diagnostic kit ( PCR - Fluorescence Probing ) ( Sansure Biotech , China , Cat . # 010101510 , hereinafter referred to as LCoV - Kit ; CapitalBio Technology ( Chengdu ) , China , Cat . # 3010202044 , hereinafter referred to as PCoV - Kit ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference material and 2019 - nCoV - RNA liquid internal quality control contained the complete sequence of ORF 1a , ORF 1b , N , E , S , and M genes of SARS - CoV - 2 , along with the mutation sites of Omicron and Delta variants . To generate lentivirus particles , target RNA vectors and lentivirus packaging vectors were co - transfected into 293T cells . The lentivirus particles were subsequently diluted to the desired concentration .

SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference material is registered in the National Reference Material Center with the registration number GBW ( E ) 091132 . LCoV - Kit and PCoV - Kit detect two conserved target sequences in the SARS - CoV - 2 , namely open reading frame ( ORF ) 1ab and nucleocapsid - encoding protein ( N ) genes . Both kits have obtained the medical device registration certificate from China Food and Drug Administration ( Certificate No . 20203400064 and 20223401469 , respectively ) . Clinical specimens Between December 1 and December 22 , 2022 , we randomly selected approximate 100 oropha - ryngeal swab specimens per day from the remaining samples collected during the COVID - 19 mass screening in Fuzhou , resulting in a total of 2 , 033 specimens . The study was approved by the ethics review committees of Fujian provincial hospital , Chinese ( K2022 - 11 - 005 ) , and all procedures were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations . Oral consents were obtained from all participants . Nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification Nucleic acid was extracted from 300 μ L sample using Natch 96B automatic nucleic acid extrac - tor ( Sansure Biotech ) according to the instrument instruction manual . When using LCoV - Kit for amplification , 20 μ L RNA extract was mixed with 26 μ L of reaction buffer and 4 μ L of enzyme mix to a 50 - μ L final volume . When using PCoV - Kit , 20 μ L RNA extract was directly added into the PCR tube containing lyopholized pellet and gently mixed to form a final vol - ume of 20 μ L . For qualitiy control , a positive control , borderline positive control , and two neg - ative controls were induced in each batch . The positive control was obtained from the kit . The borderline positive control was prepared by diluting the 2019 - nCoV - RNA liquid internal qual - ity control , which had an initial concentration of 1000 copies / mL , in a two - fold manner . The negative controls were saline and the negative control provided in the kit , respectively . PCR amplification was performed on SLAN - 96S fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument ( Shang - hai Hongshi Medical Technology , China ) . The viral target included open reading frame 1ab ( ORF1ab ) and nucleocapsid protein ( N ) . Ct value were calculated for both reference gene and target genes with auto - baseline and auto - threshold . The results are defined positive if Ct value < 40 , otherwise negative . Samples are identified as positive when the N gene and ORF1ab gene are both positive . Sensitivity evaluation SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference material BDS - BW - 117 ( 2 . 0 × 10 5 copies / mL ) was diluted with sample preservation solution to 150 copies / mL , the limit of detection ( LOD ) stated in the man - ual of PCoV - Kit . The nominal detection limit of LCoV - Kit was 200 copies / mL . The extracted RNA was tested 20 times in duplicate using PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit , respectively , to verify the sensitivity . The kit was considered to pass the verification if the coincidence rate of positive results was � 95 % . Precision evaluation SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference material BDS - BW - 117 ( 2 . 0 × 10 5 copies / mL ) was diluted with sample preservation solution to the concentration of 300 copies / mL ( C300 ) and 500 copies / mL ( C500 ) , respectively . RNA extracted from C300 and C500 samples was tested 10 times in duplicate with PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit , respectively .

CV � 5 % was considered to be stable . Accuracy evaluation We selected 10 positive samples ( 5 each for C300 and C500 ) and 10 negative samples ( sample preservation solution ) as the sample pool for the accuracy evaluation . All analyses were per - formed after random consecutive numbering of samples , which was only revealed after finish - ing all analyses . The test results were compared with the expected results , and the negative , positive and total coincidence rates of PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit were calculated . Evaluation of the specificity of the assays was described in S1 Appendix . Amplification efficiency measurement The SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference material ( 2 . 0 × 10 5 copies / mL ) was diluted 1 : 10 in sample preservation solution to form concentration gradients : SE5 ( 2 . 0 × 10 5 copies / mL ) , SE4 ( 2 × 10 4 copies / mL ) , SE3 ( 2 × 10 3 copies / mL ) , and SE2 ( 2 × 10 2 copies / mL ) . RNA extracted from SE5 - SE2 samples was tested 5 times in duplicate with PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit , respectively . An amplification standard curve was plotted of Log ( concentration ) versus Ct value and the slope ( K ) was derived . The amplification efficiency ( E ) was calculated according to the for - mula : E = 10 − 1 / K - 1 . Testing of clinical specimens and statistical analysis RNA of 2 , 033 oropharyngeal swab specimens was extracted as described above and detected with PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit , respectively . Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and statistical significance was assumed at p < 0 . 05 . Normal distribution was reported as means with SD . Pearson χ 2 was used to compare the positive test results . Sensitivity , specificity , pre - dictive value of positive test ( PVP ) , predictive value of negative test ( PVN ) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient ( κ ) were calculated using DAG _ Stat ( https : / / biostats . com . au / DAG _ Stat / ) . κ was used to assess the consistency of the test results . When κ value is 0 – 0 . 40 indicated poor agree - ment , 0 . 41 – 0 . 60 , moderate agreement , 0 . 61 – 0 . 80 , good agreement , and > 0 . 80 , very good agreement . Box plots , generated with Origin , was used to show the distribution of Ct values and test results using different kits . Results Sensitivity evaluation When 150 copies / mL of SARS - CoV - 2 reference material was used for testing , the positive detection rates of PCoV - Kit was 100 % , and the detection rates of single target genes ( ORF1ab and N gene ) were both 20 / 20 , which met the nominal LOD of PCoV - Kit manufacturer . The LCoV - Kit , with a nominal LOD of 200 copies / mL , demonstrated a detection rate of 100 % comparable to that of PCoV - Kit . The sensitivity test results are shown in Table 1 , while the corresponding raw data can be found in S1 Table . Table 1 . Sensitivity evaluation of PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit ( x ± s , n = 20 ) .

Especially , when the two reagents were used to detect C500 , the CV of both two target genes was less than 1 % , indicating that the two reagents had better precision and stability when detecting high concentration samples . The results of precison evaluation are presented in Table 2 , while the corresponding raw data can be found in S2 Table . Accuracy evaluation Blind test of SARS - CoV - 2 in 10 randomly numbered samples showed that the total coinci - dence rate of PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit was 100 % , indicating that these two reagents had good accuracy . The corresponding raw data are presented in S3 Table . Amplification efficiency measurement Ten - folds serial dilutions of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA reference material ranging from SE5 ( 2 . 0 × 10 5 copies / mL ) , SE4 ( 2 × 10 4 copies / mL ) , SE3 ( 2 × 10 3 copies / mL ) , to SE2 ( 2 × 10 2 copies / mL ) were used to generate the standard curve . The standard curve was drawn according to the quantity and Ct value of the samples . The results are shown in Table 3 and Fig 1 , and the corresponding raw data are presented in S4 Table . The amplification efficiency of N gene and ORF1ab gene for PCoV - Kit were 107 . 7 % and 108 . 9 % , respectively , while they were both 102 . 9 % for LCoV - - Kit , indicating that the amplification efficiency of LCoV - Kit was closer to the optimal state . The correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) for each standard curve was above 0 . 99 , suggesting good linearity .

The raw data of specimens are presented in S5 Table . As shown in Table 4 , the average age of the subjects was 39 . 3 ± 13 . 5 years ( range , 1 – 83 years ) , with 63 . 1 % of the population being male and 36 . 9 % female . Overall , 392 ( 19 . 28 % ) were tested positive by PCoV - Kit and 424 ( 20 . 86 % ) by LCoV - Kit ( Table 5 ) . PCoV - Kit correctly classified 96 . 85 % ( 95 % CI : 96 . 00 % - 97 . 57 % ) of all samples with a sensitivity of 88 . 68 % ( 95 % CI : 85 . 27 % - 91 . 53 % ) , specificity of 99 . 01 % ( 95 % CI : 98 . 39 % - 99 . 43 % ) , PVP of 95 . 92 % ( 95 % CI : 93 . 46 % - 97 . 65 % ) , and PVN of 97 . 07 % ( 95 % CI : 96 . 14 % - 97 . 84 % ) . A chi - square test performed by SPSS 22 . 0 confirmed there was no significant difference in the positive detection rate of PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit ( χ 2 = 1 . 57 , P > 0 . 05 ) . The Kappa coeffi - cient was 0 . 90 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 88 – 0 . 93 ) , indicating a good consistency between the two reagents . Furthermore , to assess the Ct value distribution and quartiles , boxplots were shown in Fig 2 . We calculated the Ct value of 376 oropharyngeal swab specimens that tested positive with both LCoV - Kit and PCoV - Kit , and the statistics are presented in S6 Table . The Ct values for N gene were 30 . 81 ± 5 . 30 and 30 . 79 ± 5 . 00 with LCoV - Kit and PCoV - Kit , respectively . For ORF1ab gene , the Ct value were 33 . 27 ± 5 . 19 and 34 . 11 ± 4 . 89 with LCoV - Kit and PCoV - Kit , respectively . The performance of both reagents was comparable . Among the 64 samples with inconsistent test results , 48 were identified as positive by LCoV - Kit but negative ( n = 18 ) or single - gene positive ( n = 30 ) by PCoV - Kit . The statistical data of the 64 samples are presented in S7 Table . These samples had a mean Ct value of 36 . 03 ± 1 . 83 for the N gene and 38 . 30 ± 1 . 56 for the ORF1ab gene . In addition , 18 samples were identified as positive by PCoV - Kit but neg - ative ( n = 4 ) or single - gene positive ( n = 12 ) by LCoV - Kit . These samples had a mean Ct value of 35 . 34 ± 0 . 96 for the N gene and 38 . 51 ± 0 . 87 for the ORF1ab gene .

Meanwhile , the elderly population were more susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection and experienced a less effective immune response after vaccination [ 17 – 19 ] . As the most populous country in the world , China is densely populated and facing the largest and fastest growth in population aging [ 20 ] . Although widespread vaccination has reduced the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and the morality of patients , attention still needs to be paid to co - infection with other viruses , such as influenza viruses , which often leads to more severe clinical symptoms and increased morality [ 9 , 10 , 19 ] . Additionally , it is imperative for the government and medical institutions to conduct ongoing surveillance of vulnerable and high - risk populations , such as the elderly . Under the circumstances , the application of precise , rapid , and convenient detection reagents is crucial for clinical diagnostics . When employing conventional liquid RT - PCR reagents , trained personnel and a separated laboratory for reagent preparation are requisite [ 21 ] . In addition , user intervention , such as pipetting errors and final concentration mistakes , may impede the accuracy of test results [ 11 , 12 ] . The " Guidelines for the Management of Cold Chain Transportation and Storage of Medical Devices " issued by the China Food and Drug Administration require continuous tem - perature monitoring during the transportation and storage of in vitro diagnostic reagents to ensure compliance with requirements . Therefore , the lower the storage temperature of the reagents , the higher the transportation and storage costs incurred . The aforementioned limita - tions can be overcome by using ready - to - use lyophilized reagents , which simplify reagents storage requirements , reduce transportation cost , and avoiding repeated freeze - thaw of reagents . This makes lyophilized reagents a viable substitute for conventional liquid reagents . In this study , we compared the performance of a novel lyophilized - pellet - based 2019 - nCoV nucleic acid diagnostic kit ( PCoV - Kit ) with a widely used commercial liquid diagnostic kit ( LCoV - Kit ) with the aim of providing clinical reference for selecting appropriate detection reagents . The amplification reagents of PCoV - Kit were lyophilized into pellets and encapsu - lated in individual PCR tubes as pellets . Upon usage , the pellets could be easily dissolved by adding nucleic acid samples to the PCR tubes and shaking . Fig 3 illustrates both the appear - ance of the pellets and their dissolved form . In the sensitivity evaluation , both kits exhibited excellent sensitivity . PCoV - Kit showed pos - itive results in all 20 tests with a sample concentration of 150 copies / mL , meeting the nominal Fig 3 .

Although LCoV - Kit has a nominal LOD of 200 copies / mL , it still achieved a 100 % ( 20 / 20 ) positive detection rate for samples , albeit with Ct value closed to the negative cut - off value ( 38 . 60 ± 0 . 61 ) . This result indicatedthat the sensitivity of PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit were comparable . Both kits also demonstrated good precision and accuracy , and there was no cross - reactivity observed with prevalent respiratory pathogens . In terms of ampli - fication efficiency evaluation , PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit both exhibited excellent linearity . The amplification efficiency for the N gene and ORF1ab gene using PCoV - Kit were 107 . 7 % and 108 . 9 % , respectively , while they were both 102 . 9 % when using LCoV - Kit . With an amplifica - tion efficiency ranging from 90 % to 110 % , the PCR assay is generally recognized as a hallmark of quality capable of producing dependable data [ 22 ] . When the amplification efficiency approaches 100 % , it indicates that the amplification process is approaching an ideal state [ 23 ] . Thus , both reagents were adequate for qualitative diagnosis in clinical settings , although LCoV - Kit performed a better amplification performance than PCoV - Kit . When 2 , 033 oropharyngeal swab specimens were tested using both kits simultaneously , the positive rate of PCoV - Kit was 19 . 28 % , which was slightly lower than that of LCoV - Kit ( 20 . 86 % ) . This finding contradicted the superior sensitivity evaluation performance of PCoV - Kit over LCoV - Kit , possibly due to the presence of PCR amplification interference substances in clinical specimens , such as food residues or oral epithelial cells that subsequently lyse and release large amounts of cellular components [ 24 ] . Therefore , the anti - interference capacity of PCoV - Kit was weaker than that of LCoV - Kit , possibly attributed to the fact that the liquid component in the amplification system of PCoV - Kit solely originates from samples ( 20 μ l ) , whereas LCoV - Kit’s amplification system contains a buffer system of 30 μ l in addition to 20 μ l samples . The positive rates of the two kits were statistically analyzed , and no significant differ - ence was found ( χ 2 = 1 . 57 , P > 0 . 05 ) . The Kappa coefficient was 0 . 90 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 88 – 0 . 93 ) , indi - cating a high level of consistency in the test results of PCoV - Kit and LCoV - Kit . Additionally , the distribution of Ct values of samples that tested positive with both kits also exhibited a high degree of consistency , as illustrated in Fig 2A . We examined the Ct value distribution of samples with inconsistent test results ( positive versus negative / single positive ) and found that they were mainly concentrated in the range of 35 ~ 40 , which falls within the borderline positive region of detection [ 25 ] . At this point , the copy number of target genes was small , close to or below the LOD of reagents , making false negatives more likely . As indicated by the list of discrepancies in test results ( S8 Table ) , a majority of the cases were single positive ( PCoV - Kit , 30 / 48 ; LCoV - Kit , 12 / 16 ) . Despite being deemed negative , these samples could prompt testing personnel to employ more sensitive detection reagents for retesting purpose , thereby ensuring the accuracy of test results . In conclusion , PCoV - Kit , as a novel lyophilized - pellet - based SARS - CoV - 2 detection kit , obviates the need for cold chain transportation and freezing storage ( Its storage temperature is 2 ~ 8˚C ) , eliminates the requirement for pre - reagent preparation , thereby saving labor , trans - port and storage cost and laboratory space , and reduce the time required for detection . In our testing , the detection performance of PCoV - Kit , including sensitivity , precision , and accuracy , can match or exceed that of conventional liquid reagent ( LCoV - Kit ) . In the detection of clini - cal oropharyngeal swab specimens , although its anti - interference capacity was inferior to that of LCoV - Kit , the reliability of its test results remained satisfactory . In the post - pandemic era , lyophilized PCR reagents are more suitable for COVID - 19 diagnosis use . Supporting information S1 Table .
