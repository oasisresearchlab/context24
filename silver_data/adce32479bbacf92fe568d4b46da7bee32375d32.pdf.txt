Analysis of Endocytic Pathways in Drosophila Cells Reveals a Conserved Role for GBF1 in Internalization via GEECs Gagan D . Gupta ¤ * , Swetha M . G . , Sudha Kumari , Ramya Lakshminarayan , Gautam Dey , Satyajit Mayor * National Centre for Biological Sciences , Bangalore , India Abstract In mammalian cells , endocytosis of the fluid phase and glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) forms GEECs ( GPI - AP enriched early endosomal compartments ) via an Arf1 - and Cdc42 - mediated , dynamin independent mechanism . Here we use four different fluorescently labeled probes and several markers in combination with quantitative kinetic assays , RNA interference and high resolution imaging to delineate major endocytic routes in Drosophila cultured cells . We find that the hallmarks of the pinocytic GEEC pathway are conserved in Drosophila and identify garz , the fly ortholog of the GTP exchange factor GBF1 , as a novel component of this pathway . Live confocal and TIRF imaging reveals that a fraction of GBF1 GFP dynamically associates with ABD RFP ( a sensor for activated Arf1 present on nascent pinosomes ) . Correspondingly , a GTP exchange mutant of GBF1 has altered ABD RFP localization in the evanescent field and is impaired in fluid phase uptake . Furthermore , GBF1 activation is required for the GEEC pathway even in the presence of Brefeldin A , implying that , like Arf1 , it has a role in endocytosis that is separable from its role in secretion .

Ltd . , Sahakar Bhavan , Sahakarnagar , Bangalore , India Introduction Internalization of cargo at the cell surface takes place via multiple mechanisms . For instance , the well - studied transferrin receptor ( TfR ) is endocytosed via the dynamin - mediated pinching of clathrin coated vesicles from the plasma membrane [ 1 , 2 ] . Other pathways that do not require clathrin or dynamin for internali - zation are less well characterized , but are also prevalent - the GEEC pathway is one such example [ 3 ] . This pathway was originally identified on the basis of the selective internalization of various GPI - APs such as the folate receptor [ 4 ] , but has also been shown to facilitate the entry of : cholera toxin bound to its ganglioside receptor GM1 [ 5 ] ; the vacuolating toxins aerolysin and VacA [ 6 ] ; and bulk fluid phase ( pinocytosis ) in diverse mammalian cells [ 4 ] . At the cell surface , a fraction of GPI - APs are organized in nanoclusters which are sensitive to the extraction of cholesterol [ 7 ] . The cholesterol - dependent organization of GPI - APs , as well as their endocytosis via the GEEC pathway , requires cortical actin polymerization [ 8 , 9 ] . Recent evidence links local actin polymer - ization to GEEC endosome formation via a regulatory circuit of two small GTPases - Cdc42 and Arf1 [ 8 , 10 ] . Here , Cdc42 cycles on or off the plasma membrane according to its active ( GTP - bound ) or inactive ( GDP - bound ) state respectively , where it promotes actin polymerization [ 8 ] . Cdc42 cycling is modulated by ARHGAP10 , a Rho GTPase - activating - protein ( GAP ) that also harbours an Arf - binding domain which is specific for Arf - GTP ( ABD ; [ 10 , 11 ] ) . Thus Cdc42 – GAP activity , and actin - driven GEEC endocytosis is coupled to Arf1 activation [ 10 ] . However , it is not known how Arf1 activation occurs during GEEC endocytosis . Arf1 activation is facilitated by guanine - nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ; [ 12 ] ) , which contain a conserved Sec7 domain responsible for GDP - GTP exchange [ 13 , 14 ] . Two well charac - terized Arf - GEF subfamilies , GBF1 and BIGs , appear to regulate Arf activation for coat recruitment and vesicular traffic at the Golgi complex [ 15 , 16 ] . It follows that these Arf - GEFs are predicted in vivo targets for the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , an established inhibitor of the secretory pathway which binds at the interface between the Sec7 domain and Arf - GDP in vitro [ 17 , 18 ] . Since the GEEC pathway is upregulated in the presence of BFA , it has been proposed that the effector GEF ( s ) required to activate Arf1 for GEEC endocytosis may be BFA - insensitive [ 10 ] . The significance of the GEEC pathway is broadening as it is identified in more mammalian cell types and additional cargo is found [ 3 ] . Furthermore , evidence from Drosophila cells indicates that the GEEC pathway may be conserved across phyla . In hemocytes derived from shibire ( Drosophila dynamin ) temperature - sensitive mutants , GPI - APs and the fluid phase continue to be internalized at the restrictive temperature [ 19 ] . However , the roles of key molecules such as Arf1 , Cdc42 , cholesterol and actin with PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6768 respect to endocytosis are unexplored in Drosophila , so the presence of a canonical GEEC pathway in this organism is still an open question . In this report , we develop quantitative endocytic assays in Drosophila S2R + cultured cells using a variety of fluorescent probes , reporters and high resolution microscopy . We then exploit the facility of long double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) mediated RNA interference in this cell line ( RNAi ; [ 20 ] ) to establish the presence of an Arf1 - mediated pinocytic pathway that bears a striking resemblance to the GEEC pathway . With the added benefit of lower gene redundancy in the Drosophila genome [ 21 ] , we utilize functional RNAi genomics to identify the Arf GEF , garz , as a candidate Arf1 effector during pinocytosis in S2R + cells . We validate this strategy by examining the role of the mammalian ortholog of garz , GBF1 , and find that it is a novel regulator of the GEEC pathway . Materials and Methods Materials Apart from the fluorochromes Cy3 , Cy5 ( AP Biotech , UK ) , Alexa488 / 568 / 647 , FITC and Latrunculin A ( Molecular Probes , OR ) , all chemicals were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich , MO . Hybridoma cultures containing anti - GFP monoclonal ( 1B3A8 ) and anti - hTFr monoclonal ( OKT9 ) were obtained from S . Sundaresan ( Bangalore Genei , India ) and American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , VA ) respectively , and purified with IgG Fast Flow columns ( Amersham , UK ) . Probes were labeled with Alexa or Cy3 / Cy5 fluorophores according to manufacturers’ instructions . Anti - Drosophila dynamin antibodies were from BD Biosciences , CA . Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories , ME . PI - PLC was purified from PI - PLC - expressing bacterial strains [ 22 ] . Plasmids and Constructs pUAST hTFr encoding the human transferrin ( Tf ) receptor ( TfR ) , and pCasper YFP - Rab7 [ 23 ] were kind gifts from S . Cohen ( EMBL , Heidelberg ) and S . Eaton ( MPI Cell Biology , Dresden ) respectively . pBSPURO was obtained from M . Wilm ( EMBL , Heidelberg ) . pUAST - GFPRab5 and pUAST - GFPRab11 were cloned by ligation of PCR generated fragments of GFP and Drosophila Rab5 or Rab11 cDNAs into the pUAST vector [ 24 ] , and subsequently sequenced . pUAST - GFPGPI [ 25 ] was obtained from the Drosophila Genome Resource Center ( DGRC , IN ) . Mammalian GFPGBF1 and GFPGBF1 E794K constructs were a kind gift from E . Sztul ( U . Alabama , Birmingham ) . Cell culture , Fly stocks , RNAi and stable lines Drosophila S2R + cells were obtained from S . Yanagawa [ 26 ] , split every 6 – 8 days and grown at room temperature ( 21 – 24 u C ) . They were maintained in Schneider’s Drosophila Insect Medium ( SDM ; Invitrogen ) supplemented with 7 . 5 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco - BRL ) and 150 m g / ml penicillin , 250 m g / ml streptomycin , and 750 m g / ml glutamine . RNAi was performed according to the procedure of Clemens [ 20 ] . Transfections were performed with Cellfectin ( Invitrogen , CA ) or Effectene ( Qiagen , Germany ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For the generation of stable lines , the PBSPURO plasmid bearing puromycin N - acetyltransferase was co - transfected at a 1 : 30 ratio with the desired constructs . Stable lines were selected over 2 – 3 weeks by incubation in medium containing 1 ug / ml puromycin . Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells stably expressing FR - GPI and human TfR ( IA2 . 2 cells ) were used for endocytic assays . CHO cells were grown in HF - 12 ( HiMEDIA , Mumbai , India ) containing NaHCO3 and penicillin , streptomycin ( 100 m g / ml ) and supplemented with 10 % FBS ( GibcoBRL , Rockville , MD ) . CHOs were transfected with different DNA constructs using FuGENE6 ( Roche Diagnostics , Germany ) according to standard protocol , and assayed 18 – 20 hrs after transfection [ 10 ] . Probes for endocytosis and immunodetection Since both the S2 line and primary cultures of Drosophila hemocytes have been previously shown to exhibit scavenger receptor - endocytosis [ 19 , 27 ] , we tested for the presence of this pathway in S2R + cells using a polyanionic ligand ( malelyated BSA ; mBSA ; [ 19 , 28 ] ) . The 10 kDa fluid phase tracer FITC - dextran was made as described previously ( Fdex ; [ 4 ] ) and 10 kDa tetramethyl rhodamine - dextran ( Rdex ) was purchased from Molecular Probes , OR . Human apo - transferrin was iron - loaded and conjugated to Alexa 568 or Alexa 647 dyes [ 29 , 30 ] . Anti - GFP hybridoma was purified ( see Materials ) and conjugated to Alexa 647 to yield A647 a GFP . Immunofluorescence was carried out as described [ 31 ] . For Tf and GPI - AP probes , stable S2R + lines constitutively expressing the well characterized human transferrin ( Tf ) receptor ( TfR ) and / or GFP - GPI were generated . Cy3 conjugated mBSA ( Cy3mBSA ; [ 19 ] ) or Alexa568 / 647 conjugated Tf ( A568Tf / A647Tf ) was used to probe receptor - mediated pathways whereas FITC or TMR conjugated to Dextran ( FDex and RDex respectively ) were used as fluid - phase tracers . The receptor probes Cy3mBSA , Cy5mBSA and biotinylated Cy3m - BSA ( Cy3bmBSA ; [ 19 ] ) were used at 10 – 30 m g / ml in S2R + cells . At these concentrations , the binding and internalization of labeled mBSA was completely competed by 100 fold excess unlabeled mBSA . Fdex and Rdex , which are markers for bulk fluid uptake , were used at 1 – 2 mg / ml , unless otherwise specified . Tf and a GFP probes were used at 10 ug / ml and 5 ug / ml respectively . In the corresponding cells , Cy3mBSA , A568 / A647 Tf and a GFP ligands show saturable receptor labeling , which is competed by 100 fold excess unconjugated ligand ( not shown ) . Uptake assays For S2R + uptake experiments , cells were incubated with endocytic probes in M1 buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 9 ; modified from [ 29 ] ) supplemented with BSA ( 1 . 5 mg / ml ) and D - glucose ( 2 mg / ml ) at room temperature ( 21 – 24 u C ) , unless otherwise indicated , and extensively washed in the same medium . To visualize the specific endocytic uptake of GFP - GPI or TfR , cells were incubated with fluorescent conjugates of a GFP or Tf ( along with fluid phase markers if needed ) at room temperature for different pulse times and then washed in M1 and placed on ice . Where necessary , PI - PLC ( 0 . 3 mg / ml ; 45 min on ice ) or ascorbate buffer with 50 ug / ml desferroxamine mesylate ( pH 4 . 5 ; 10 min on ice ) treatment was carried out to remove cell - surface GFP - GPI or Tf respectively . Surface pools of receptors were labeled by further incubation on ice with antibodies to GFP ( a GFP with a different fluorochrome ) or anti - hTfR ( Okt9 ) for 30 min . Subsequently , cells were washed , fixed ( 2 . 5 % paraformaldehyde in M1 ) and imaged . When required , endosomal pH was neutralized by the addition of ammonium chloride ( 30 mM in M1 ) post - fixation so as to dequench pH - sensitive fluorochromes . Assays for surface accessibility of mBSA were carried out as described previously [ 19 ] . Mammalian uptake experiments were carried out exactly as described previously [ 10 ] . For Brefeldin A ( BFA ) experiments , IA2 . 2 cells were treated with 20 m g / ml BFA for 60 min and pulsed with TMR - Dex during the last 10 min before fixation and imaging . For determining externalization rates in S2R + lines ( see [ 32 ] ) , cells were incubated in the presence of a saturating concentration GEEC Endocytosis in Drosophila PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6768 of A568 Tf for varying times until they achieved a maximum , steady - state value of cell - associated label . Since Tf binding to surface TfR is rapid , and since saturating levels of Tf were used in this assay , the rate of accumulation of Tf is mainly dependent upon the rate at which unoccupied intracellular TfR are externalized to the plasma membrane to acquire Tf . The exocytic rate constant , k e can be quantitated once the parameters Tf s and Tf ss are estimated from a best fit to the function : Tf t ~ Tf s z Tf ss 1 { exp { ke t ð Þ h i where Tf t is the total amount of Tf bound to TfR at time t ; Tf s is the amount of Tf bound to surface TfR ( constant in this assay ) ; and Tf ss is the Tf bound to internal TfR at steady state . The values for k e are determined from the best least - squares fit to this function [ 29 ] . As a control , to evaluate the contribution of the biosynthetic pool of TfR during the course of the assay , cells were pretreated with 75 m M cyclohexaminde for 2 hrs and the assay was carried out in the presence of cyclohexamide ( Figure S2B ) . Cholesterol measurements and serum delipidation FBS was delipidated by organic extraction with diethyl ether according to Cham and Knowles [ 33 ] , and dialysed extensively in PBS . This extraction reduced total cholesterol content by over 99 % as measured by the Red Amplex Cholesterol Assay Kit ( , 10 ug / ml sterol ; Molecular Probes , OR ) , while leaving overall protein levels in serum unchanged . S2R + cells were adapted to growth in delipidated medium containing 10 % lipid - extracted FBS in SDM . This was achieved by serial passage in 150 ml flasks with linearly increasing levels of lipid - extracted FBS over 5 – 8 weeks . Filipin staining and methl - b - cyclodextin ( M b CD ) treat - ments were as described previously [ 8 ] except that the incubation temperature was reduced to 22 u C to match optimum growth conditions for Drosophila cells . Fluorescence imaging , quantification and processing Wide field imaging was carried out on a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope and images captured with a CASCADE II camera ( Photometrics , AZ ) . Fluorescence quantification was carried out with a low magnification objective ( 20x , 0 . 75NA ) to obtain 30 – 100 cells per field , while higher resolution images for visualization purposes were obtained with a 60X , 1 . 4NA objective . Confocal microscopy was carried out on an Andor Spinning Disc confocal imaging system ( 60x 1 . 42 NA or 100x 1 . 4 NA , with Ixon EMCCD ; Andor Technologies , Ireland ) using appropriate factory - set filters and dichroics for different fluorophores . Care was taken to avoid fluorophore saturation during acquisition . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy imaging was done on a custom - built setup around a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000U inverted microscope ( described in detail in [ 8 ] ) . Images were collected using appropriate filters onto cooled EMCCD - based Cascade 512B cameras ( Roper Scientific , AZ ) with ‘on - chip multiplication gain’ feature for providing single - molecule detection sensitivity in solutions and cells . For two - colour TIRF microscopy , cells were illuminated sequentially by 488 or 543 nm lasers and fluorescence emission was collected using corresponding emission filters mounted on a shutter wheel ( Sutter Instruments , CA ) operating coordinately with the illuminating lasers . Background subtraction and fluorescence quantitation was carried out as described previously [ 29 ] using MetaMorph or custom routines written in MATLAB ( described in Figure S1 ) . Statistical methods were as described previously [ 10 ] . Images were pseudo - coloured using Adobe Photoshop and composites were assembled using the same software . Quantification of colocalization was performed as described [ 4 , 34 ] . All processing including determination of colocalization was performed using similar parameters regardless of the type of endocytic tracer used . Colocalization fraction was calculated as the number of endosomes per cell whose surface area overlapped at least 30 % in each cell . The maximum extent of colocalization obtained by this method is 80 % for cointernalized A647 - TfR and A568 - TfR in the same cell [ 4 ] . RT - PCR and Western blotting For each condition or dsRNA treatment , about 10 ug total RNA was extracted from , 10 6 S2R + cells with Trizol reagent ( Sigma ) . First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen , CA ) and a polyT22 primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The reaction product was then treated with DNAse - free RNAse ( Ambion , CA ) to remove RNA template . Gene - specific primers spanning introns were designed to confirm the absence of genomic DNA contamination during PCR for each transcript . PCR was performed for 20 cycles and 30 cycles for semi - quantitative comparison of amplification . Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols . Results Pathways of endocytosis in Drosophila S2R + cells The S2R + cell line , which expresses a wingless pathway receptor [ 26 ] is believed to be a derivative of the embryonic S2 line [ 35 ] . The morphology of these cells is heterogeneous , but the majority of cells spread out , exhibiting broad and thin lamellapodia [ 36 ] . These characteristics allow for high resolution wide field imaging of early endosomes . To visualize early steps of internalization , we co - pulsed S2R + cells with fluid phase ( Fdex / Rdex ) and receptor ( Cy3mBSA and / or A647Tf ) probes for very short times ( 30 – 60 s ) and fixed them before imaging ( see Materials and Methods for details of probes ) . Post - pulse most of the Fdex and Cy3mBSA probes were found in separate , peripheral structures ( Figure 1A ) . By contrast , Cy3mBSA was largely found together with internal - ized Cy5Tf in the same period ( Figure 1A ) . Quantification of colocalization of these structures indicated that Tf puncta were , 5 fold enriched in mBSA when compared to Fdex ( graph in Figure 1A ) . Conversely , only a small fraction of Fdex punctae also contained Tf and mBSA when all three probes were co - pulsed ( Figure 1A ) . To follow the endocytic route of GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) , S2R + cells stably expressing GFP - GPI were pulsed with Alexa 647 - coupled antibodies to GFP ( A647 a GFP ) and Rdex ( Figure 1A ) . Internalized Rdex labeled structures contained significantly more GFP - GPI as marked by A647 a GFP , compared to mBSA or Tf ( graph in Figure 1A ) . To examine nascent endosomes present close to the plasma membrane at higher resolution , we pulsed cells expressing clathrin light chain GFP with Rdex and A647Tf for 40 s and imaged them with TIRF microscopy . In the evanescent field , the fraction of clathrin GFP punctae that colocalized with Tf at early times was over 10 fold greater than those that contained Rdex ( Figure 1B ) . Sequence of endosome mixing and separation , and the fate of endocytic cargo To study endosomal dynamics , we generated a stable S2R + line expressing moderate levels of Rab5 GFP , an early endosomal marker which participates in homo - and hetero - typic endosome fusion and sorting steps [ 37 ] , and performed pulse - chase assays with Rdex and A647Tf . When levels of colocalization with the GEEC Endocytosis in Drosophila PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6768 Figure 1 . Fluid phase and GFP GPI probes mark a distinct endocytic route at early time points in S2R + cells . ( A ) FITC - or TMR - dextran ( Fdex , Rdex respectively ) was pulsed along with : malelyated BSA or A568 / A647 TfR ( mBSA , TfR respectively ) ; or a GFP ( to mark internalized GFP GPI ) for 30 – 60 s . Cells were fixed and imaged with wide field microscope at high resolution . Colocalization of different probes in combination with each other was then quantified .

Interestingly , mixed endosomes overlapped with Rab5 punctae in a biphasic pattern , rising rapidly to encompass over 60 % of Rab5 punctae at 2 min post probe entry and falling to pre - pulse levels with longer chase times ( Figure 2A ) . This time course is not influenced by overexpression of Rab5 - GFP protein , as mixing kinetics of Fdex and Tf in lines with or without Rab5 GFP was similar ( Figure S2A ) . Furthermore , heterotypic mixing between Fdex and TfR probes in wild type cells also rises rapidly to a peak in a 2 min pulse ( Figure 2B ) , a process that in mammalian cells has been shown to require Rab5 function [ 38 ] . A similar time course of mixing was found when examining homotypic fusion between fluid - containing endosomes , which always occurred in Rab5 marked structures ( Figure 2C ) . We next examined the kinetics of Tf binding and recycling in Drosophila cells in detail because it is unclear whether the canonical Tf pathway operates in insect lines [ 39 ] . The binding and uptake of TfR was kinetically analyzed over 2 hrs with saturating levels of A568Tf ( Figure 3A ) in an approach to steady - state assay ( Materials and Methods ; [ 32 ] ) . At each time point , total binding of Tf at room temperature was normalized to levels of Tf bound out to steady state ( upto 2 hrs ) . Total binding at 4 u C was assumed to be the initial surface receptor occupancy . Uptake at room temper - ature exceeded binding at 4 u C by 2 . 5 - fold and saturated after 15 – 20 min , and similar values were obtained when the assay was carried out with cyclohexamide ( to block synthesis of new TfR ; Figure S2B ) . The kinetics of approach to steady state reflect the rate of export of the TfR to the cell surface with a rate constant of 0 . 216 / min ( t 1 / 2 , 3 min ) if we assume a single first order process . This value agrees with the time course of quantitative TfR uptake in S2R + cells after surface receptor normalization with Okt9 ( not Figure 2 . Fluid phase and TfR pathways intersect in Rab5 - positive compartments and subsequently follow expected fates . ( A ) TMR - dextran ( Rdex ) was co - pulsed with A647Tf ( TfR ) in cells expressing Rab5 GFP ( Rab5 GFP ) for 30 s ( left pane ) or the pulse was chased for 4 min in complete medium ( right pane ) . Graph shows quantified colocalization indices over different pulse ( 30 s or 60 s ) and pulse and chase times ( 1 min pulse and 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 min chase ; and a 3 min pulse and 30 min chase ) of : Tf - labeled endosomes co - localized with Rab5 GFP ( blue symbols and line ) ; Rdex endosomes with Rab5 GFP ( red symbols and line ) ; and Rab5 GFP - labelled endosomes that contained both Rdex and Tf ( green symbols and line ) . Data points represent mean 6 s . e . m pooled from 2 independent experiments with at least 20 cells for each point . ( B ) Time course of mixing of Fdex , mBSA and TfR probes in S2R + cells . Colocalization values for different probes and pulse times ( 0 . 5 min , 1 min , 2 min , 5 min and 10 min ; or a 15 min chase following a 1 min pulse ) were obtained as described earlier ( Figure 1A ) . The fraction of TfR or mBSA endosomes that also contain Fdex is relatively low at all time points [ TfR - Fdex ( brown symbols and line ) and mBSA - Fdex ( red symbols and line ) , respectively ] ) . Conversely , the fraction of Fdex endosomes that contain TfR ( Fdex - TfR ; blue symbols and line ) or mBSA ( Fdex - mBSA ; green symbols and line ) is initially low , and increases with longer pulse times . ( C ) S2R + cells expressing Rab5 GFP were pulsed with Rdex , washed and then pulsed with A647dex to examine homotypic fusion of newly formed fluid endosomes ( see schema at the top of image ) . Rab5 GFP was not found on endosomes labeled with either the first or the second short pulse of dextran ( left panel ) . When the two staggered pulses were chased for 4 min ( right panel ) , endosomes containing the first pulse acquired Rab5 GFP ( empty arrowheads ) and a fraction of these also contained the second pulse ( filled arrowheads ) . There was little or no mixing between the two pulses outside Rab5 GFP labeled structures .

Also , this externalization rate is 3 fold higher than in CHO cells ( 0 . 069 / min , t 1 / 2 , 10 min ; Johnson et al . , 1993 ) , and , 10 fold higher than that of GFP - GPI in S2R + cells ( 0 . 02883 / min , t 1 / 2 , 25 min ; Figure 3A ) . Consistent with a recycling step , a significant pool of internalized TfR after a 20 min pulse was found in large endosomes that also labeled with antibodies to the recycling marker Rab11 ( Figure 3A ) and were devoid of the lysosomally directed fluid phase ( Figure 3B ) , and unlikely to enter a degradative pathway . Consistent with this , Tf levels inside cells were not sensitive to the addition of protease inhibitors ( PI ; Figure 3C ) . After a 20 min pulse , the majority of internalized endosomes that accumulated Fdex were marked by YFP - Rab7 ( Figure 3B ) , and co - localized with Cy3 - mBSA ( not shown ; [ 19 ] ) . Internalized Cy3mBSA , a marker that traverses the lysosomal route ( Sriram et al . , 2003 ) , is protected from degradation in the presence of PI ( Figure 3C ) . We also monitored the change in pH accessed by fluid - phase markers , upon increasing chase time in the endocytic pathway . Consistent with Rab5 acquisition in sorting endosomes , the pH of fluid - containing endosomes 2 min after internalization , as measured by a ratiometric assay [ 38 ] , is , 6 . 0 ( Figure 3D ; [ 40 ] ) . This value drops to pH 4 . 5 once the probes reach deeper in the endocytic pathway ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , S2R + cells also have an endocytic system that resembles that of a typical mammalian cell ( early endosomal [ 41 ] ; late endosomal transport [ 42 ] ) . Here , endocytic trafficking involves a hetero and homo - typic mixing of Figure 3 . Characteristics of endosomal progression in S2R + cells . ( A ) A568Tf ( TfR ) was pulsed for 15 min and cells were processed for immunocytochemistry with anti - Rab11 ( a Rab11 ) , and subsequently imaged at high resolution .

To label different populations of endosomes , S2R + cells were either pulsed for 30 s with Fdex and Rdex or pulsed and then chased for 2 min , 4 min , 10 min and 45 min ( shown on the graph as squares filled in descending grayscale ) .

A dynamin - independent pinocytic pathway in S2R + cells We next assessed if endocytic trafficking of any of the endocytosed cargo had a requirement for dynamin , one of a set of key molecular criteria used for the characterization of endocytic pathways [ 3 ] . S2R + cells were treated with control dsRNA against the gene for zeocin resistance ( which is absent in the Drosophila genome ) or dsRNA corresponding to , 800 bp of coding sequence for the shibire gene , which codes for Drosophila dynamin . The dsRNA for shibire was effective in reducing protein levels for the target gene as seen in Western blots ( Figure 4A ) . In control cells , TIRF imaging showed that antibodies to shibire label discrete puncta at the plasma membrane , which are presumably clathrin coated pits [ 19 , 43 ] . This localization was lost in shibire depleted cells ( Figure 4A ) . Cells depleted for dynamin were pulsed with either Fdex or A647 a GFP ( to label GFP - GPI ) and A568Tf for 3 min . The ratio of internalized a GFP or Tf to the surface levels of the respective receptors in each cell was determined quantitatively via MATLAB routines ( see Figure S1 for methodology of quantitative endocytic assays ) . In cells without dynamin , the internalized to surface ratio of TfR was reduced , 50 % compared to control cells ( Figure 4B ) . The difference was largely due to an accumulation of TfR on the surface , probably reflecting a decreased rate of internalization of Tf . We verified this response to dynamin depletion using the fluorescent probe for the endogenous scavenger receptor , mBSA , in an accessibility assay ( Figure 4C ) . The assay was used previously to assess the accessibility of clathrin coated pits to receptor ligands in Drosophila hemocytes harbouring a temperature sensitive shibire allele [ 19 ] . Here both control and shibire depleted cells showed similar quantitative levels of biotinylated mBSA ( bmBSA ) labeling , but the bmBSA in the shibire - depleted cells was , 2 fold more accessible to streptavidin ( Figure 4C , indicative of surface - arrested receptor pits [ 19 ] . The effect of dynamin depletion on Tf endocytosis was similar to that of rapid dynamin inhibition with the small molecule inhibitor dynasore ( [ 44 ] ; Figure 4D ) . Notably , the levels of normalized GFP - GPI uptake were not different from controls in shibire - depleted ( Figure 4B ) or dynasore treated cells ( Figure 4D ) . Similarly , these cells also exhibited normal or higher levels of Fdex uptake after loss of dynamin function ( Figures 4B , D ) , and Fdex endosomes continued to accumulate in cells which contained surface - arrested bmBSA structures ( Figure 4C ) . Thus , dynamin depletion in S2R + cells inhibits internalization of two classes of receptors , and increases their surface accessibility , while GFP - GPI and fluid uptake is not inhibited . These data conclusively show that although TfR and scavenger receptors ( for mBSA ) are internalized using dynamin - dependent mecha - nisms , GPI - AP and fluid - phase uptake relies on mechanisms that do not utilize dynamin . Actin and cholesterol dependence of endocytic pathways Since agents that manipulate cholesterol levels in cells may have pleiotropic effects and can be toxic to the cells , the precise role of cholesterol in steady state cellular processes like constitutive endocytosis has been difficult to interpret . Here we exploit the finding that Drosophila cells can produce lipids from metabolic pathways , but lack key genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis [ 45 ] . By substituting normal serum with delipidated serum ( which contains , 10 ug / ml cholesterol ; see Materials and Methods ) in fly growth medium , we could severely restrict the supply of cholesterol into S2R + cells . We find that delipidated serum - adapted cells are able to grow well despite , 1 % of normal sterol levels in their membranes ( as measured by filipin binding ; Figure 5A , and Carvalho et al . , submitted ) . Notably , these adapted cells take in significantly lower levels of Fdex in a quantitative assay ( Figure 5B ) . Furthermore , surface levels of TfRs are reduced in these cells ( not shown ) , but their internalization is unaffected . The specific effect of cholesterol depletion on Fdex uptake can be reversed by incubating the depleted cells in cholesterol containing medium for 12 hrs ( Figure 5B ) . Repleted cells exhibit normal levels of Fdex uptake , and have high levels of Tf internalization when normalized to surface pools of the receptor ( Figure 5B ) . The surface levels of TfR remain low in these repleted cells ( not shown ) , perhaps owing to slower recovery kinetics over the 12 hr incubation period . In S2R + cells , both Fdex and Tf uptake were highly sensitive to the actin disrupting agent Latrunculin A ( Lat ) or Jasplakinolide ( Jas ) . Cells were incubated with 1 m M Lat , or 4 m M Jas for a total of 30 min , in which time they were pulsed with Fdex or TfR in the presence of drug for different periods . Both Fdex and normalized Tf internalization was reduced . 50 % at short pulse times in Lat ( 1 min ; Figure 5C ) . By contrast , treatment with Jas had little effect on Fdex uptake at short pulse times , while strongly inhibiting TfR uptake . At longer pulse times , Fdex accumulated in Lat treated cells , while Jas treated cells showed lower levels of Fdex uptake , and TfR uptake appeared to recover to steady state levels seen in untreated cells ( Figure 5C ) . To test whether the accumulation of Fdex in Lat treated cells is due to a strong inhibition of a recycling pathway that facilitates regurgitation of fluid [ 8 ] , we examined cells that were pre - pulsed with Fdex and then chased over different times in the presence of Lat . Notably , a large fraction of accumulated Fdex leaves the cell over short times ( , 5 min ) in untreated cells , while the presence of Lat inhibits this efflux ( Figure 5D ) . In summary , our results indicate that the main features of a cholesterol and actin sensitive GPI - AP endocytic pathway that does not utilize Dynamin appear conserved in S2R + cells . An Arf1 - and Cdc42 - dependent pathway in S2R + cells that does not require Arf6 , Rho or Rac1 As a basis for a molecular understanding of dynamin indepen - dent endocytosis in S2R + cells , we first tested the involvement of Drosophila orthologues of several candidate genes known from other systems ( Cdc42 , Rho , Rac1 , Arf6 and Arf1 ; [ 3 ] ) . Depletion of the corresponding transcript after dsRNA treatment was verified using rtPCR ( Figure 6A ) , and cells were pulsed with Fdex and A568Tf and their normalized per cell uptake was quantitated as before . As expected from their roles in the secretory pathway , Arf1 and Cdc42 were required for the surface delivery of TfR ( as determined by by the reduced surface Okt9 binding compared to control cells ; Figure 6A ) . Strikingly , uptake of Tf when normalized to the lower surface levels of Tf receptor , was not affected in cells depleted of Arf1 or Cdc42 . Instead , both genes were required for optimal levels of fluid phase uptake . Rac1 , Rho or Arf6 depletion did not have major effects on uptake of either probe ( Figure 6A ) . We examined Arf1 - depleted cells at higher resolution because this gene has been shown to be directly involved in the early steps of endocytosis via GEECs in mammalian cells [ 10 ] . Consistent with an early role in the process , Arf1 - depleted S2R + cells contained fewer fluid endosomes after a short pulse , and the remaining endosomes were significantly reduced in intensity ( Figure 6B ) . To test if the pathways of uptake of TfR and Fdex were indeed distinct as dynamin - and Arf1 - dependent respectively , we co - depleted cells with dsRNA against both Arf1 and shibire . Fdex uptake was only reduced in the GEEC Endocytosis in Drosophila PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6768 Figure 4 .

The bar graph shows that after 3 min of pulse followed by 10 min of chase , shi depleted cells show , twofold higher levels of Cy5SA binding when compared to controls ( mean 6 s . e . m . ; 2 experiments , . 30 cells in all cases ) , although they bind the same amount of Cy3bmBSA . Furthermore , while Fdex continued to be internalized and trafficked towards the center of shi - depleted cells ( filled arrowheads in right panel ) , the large majority of Cy3bmBSA labeled structures were found at the cell periphery , largely accessible to Cy5SA ( empty arrowheads ) . By this time , in control cells , Cy3bmBSA and Fdex had mixed extensively in central structures which were inaccessible to Cy5SA ( marked with filled arrowheads ) .

Conserved role of garz and its mammalian counterpart GBF1 in Arf1 - mediated endocytic uptake After ascertaining the presence of an Arf1 - mediated pinocytic pathway in Drosophila cells and establishing the necessary tools to assay endocytosis , we sought to identify conserved components of this pathway using functional genomic RNAi analysis . To find candidate regulators of Arf1 , we screened several orthologous members of the family of Arf GEFs and GAPs in Drosophila for defects in quantitative fluid phase and Tf uptake ( Figure 7A ) . While there were several interesting molecules whose depletion affected both Tf and Fdex uptake , we chose to focus on the Drosophila Arf GEF gartenzwerg ( garz ) because it was a candidate GTPase regulator which appeared to be exclusively required for Fdex uptake ( Figure 7A ) . Sequence alignment and domain analysis indicates that Drosophila garz is the likely ortholog of human GBF1 , with over 60 % amino acid conservation over the entire length of the protein products ( Figure 7B ) . We used the well - characterized GTPase exchange mutant E794K to perturb GBF1 function [ 46 , 47 ] . The glutamic acid to lysine substitution within the catalytic Sec7 domain abolishes the nucleotide exchange activity , such that this mutant GEF binds Arf – GDP , but does not catalyze GDP displacement [ 46 ] . The overexpression of GBF1 E794K in CHO cells caused a specific inhibition of Rdex uptake , whereas internalization of Tf was unaffected ( Figure 7C ) . Dynamics of GBF1 reveals a functional association with Arf1 GFPGBF1 , which reflects the native GBF1 distribution in cells [ 46 ] , is primarily cytosolic and cycles rapidly on and off Figure 5 .

It follows that the membrane bound fraction of GFP - GBF1 shows extensive colocalization with Arf1 in these organelles [ 16 , 48 ] . Recently , activated Arf1 has also been detected in punctuate structures close to / at the plasma membrane by TIRF microscopy by using the Arf - binding domain ( ABD ) of ARHGAP10 fused to GFP as a specific sensor [ 10 ] . The specificity of ABD for activated Arf1 stems from the observation that in the evanescent plane , it colocalizes with Arf1 puncta and with nascent pinosomes , and this localization is altered upon overexpression of dominant - negative Arf1 or depletion of Arf1 by shRNA [ 10 ] . To examine the role of GBF1 in Arf1 activation near the plasma membrane , cells expressing low levels of GFP - GBF1 were imaged with live TIRF microscopy . A fraction of the total ( wide - field ) pool of GFP - GBF1 was detectable as punctuate structures in the evanescent field ( Figure 8A ) . In live cells co - expressing ABD - RFP and GFP - GBF1 , two colour fast confocal scanning near the plasma membrane revealed a sub - population of puncta which associated with both probes ( Figure 8B ) . In time lapse TIRF microscopy , a fraction of GFP - GBF1 structures that were tracked over time were found to associate with activated Arf1 as masked by ABD - RFP ( Figure 8C left panel ) . Notably , the overexpression of the activation mutant GFP - GBF1 E794K caused a striking loss of ABD puncta , leaving only a flat haze in the evanescent field ( Figure 8C right panel ) . This altered distribution of the ABD sensor was similar to that observed previously with overexpression of the activation - impaired Arf1 T31N mutant , and of Arf1 shRNA [ 10 ] . Qualitatively , the residence time of GFP - GBF1 labeled structures in the evanescent plane was also much longer in the E794K mutant ( Figure 8C ) , which is consistent with previous reports that describe the prolonged membrane association of this cycling - defective protein [ 46 , 47 ] . GBF1 , in keeping with its established role in ER - Golgi transport , could affect endocytosis indirectly by modulating the Figure 6 .

We tested this possibility by first inhibiting Golgi - to - cell surface traffic with Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , and then examining the effect of GBF1 activation on endocytosis . In this assay , wild type cells treated with BFA show increased levels of fluid phase uptake , presumably because factors required for this uptake are released from the Golgi compartment [ 10 ] . We found that GFP - GBF1 overexpression alone had no effect on increased fluid uptake following BFA treatment ( Figure 8D ) . By contrast , expression of GFP - GBF1 E794K caused a reversal of this BFA - dependent increase ( Figure 8D ) . This reversal , also seen in cells expressing the Arf1 T31N mutant [ 10 ] , implicates BFA - insensitive GBF1 activation in the fluid uptake pathway . Together this data indicates a direct role for GBF1 in Arf1 activation in the vicinity of the plasma membrane . Discussion Conservation of the GEEC pathway in Drosophila This work demonstrates that the Arf1 - mediated pathway in Drosophila bears a striking similarity to the GEEC pathway first described in mammalian cells [ 4 , 8 , 38 ] . In both cases , acidic early pinosomes which contain GPI - APs are segregated from transferrin cargo and from Rab5 marked endosomes . The formation of these pinosomes requires optimum levels of cholesterol , actin and a functional Arf1 / Cdc42 machinery , and can proceed without functional dynamin and clathrin . Several clathrin - independent pathways other than the Arf1 - mediated route have been described in mammalian cells - these depend on caveolin , RhoA , Arf6 or Rac1 [ 3 , 10 ] . The absence of caveolin in Drosophila and the lack of effect on endocytosis upon knockdown of Rho , Arf6 and Rac1 on the specific cargo tested indicate that these molecules may be recruited for specialized pathways that have recently emerged during mammalian evolution . The features of the Arf1 - mediated GEEC pathway however , having been conserved across phyla , may represent the hallmarks of a primordial route of entry into metazoan cells . The present delineation of endocytic pathways in Drosophila S2R + cells , coupled with previous evidence from primary cultures of hemocytes [ 19 ] and from S2 cells [ 39 , 49 ] , argues for at least two routes of entry in Drosophila cells : a Tf and mBSA carrying pathway that requires clathrin and dynamin ; and a bulk fluid phase uptake pathway that carries a large fraction of GFP - GPI . At present , we cannot rule out the presence of additional endocytic pathways , since a fraction of GFP - GPI is detected as separate from fluid cargo , and some Tf continues to enter cells in the absence of dynamin . The use of additional probes in combination with specific gene knockdowns will help to dissect these findings further . Following internalization , both receptor and fluid pathways converge onto Rab5 containing endosomes , where heterotypic and homotypic mixing occurs . The kinetics of mixing of transferrin / mBSA and fluid phase cargo in S2R + cells are similar to those described for Drosophila hemocytes , where mixed cargo reached late endosomes within 5 min [ 19 ] . Compared to CHO cells , TfR recycling occurs at faster rates in S2R + cells . While we have assumed , based on a parsimonious fit to the data that TfR efflux occurs as a first order process , a two component model that allows for fast and slow recycling steps can also be proposed [ 50 ] . A fast recycling step is consistent with the kinetics of Rab5 acquisition , which peaks at 2 min post - internalization and with the observed regurgitation of , 40 % of internalized bulk fluid phase over 5 min . In this aspect , S2R + cells , which are related to the macrophage S2 isolates [ 26 ] , appear similar to specialized phagocytic cell types where fast receptor recycling is common [ 51 , 52 ] . While similarities exist between phagocytosis and macropinocytosis in mammalian cells [ 53 ] and molecules such as actin and Cdc42 are common to macropinocytosis and Arf1 - mediated pinocytosis , the fluid phase pathway described here in Drosophila appears to be unstimulated and does not depend on Rac1 activity . We suggest that this pathway , akin to the GEEC pathway described in mammalian cells , is a distinct constitutive pinocytic process [ 4 ] . Our observations of differential , time - dependent sensitivity of fluid uptake to Latrunculin versus Jasplakinolide , as well as dependence of the process on Cdc42 , suggest the requirement for a highly dynamic population of actin for mediating pinocytic entry . Recent evidence indicates that cortical actin dynamics drives the complexation of GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) on the cell surface in a cholesterol dependent manner [ 9 ] , and Cdc42 activity as well as the proper organization of GPI - APs is a requirement for internalization via the GEEC pathway [ 7 , 8 ] . Our description of a cholesterol - auxotrophic cell line defective in fluid phase uptake should allow further investigation of the relationship between cholesterol , GPI - AP organization and Cdc42 activity . Role of GBF1 in Arf1 - mediated endocytosis There are several lines of evidence for the involvement of the GTPase exchange factor GBF1 in Arf1 - mediated endocytosis . The depletion of the GBF1 ortholog garz in S2R + cells results in specific inhibition of Arf1 - dependent fluid uptake . Concurrently , expres - sion of the exchange defective GBF1 E794K mutant results in the same defect in CHO cells . A fraction of GBF1 colocalizes with ABD - RFP - a specific sensor for activated Arf1 - in the evanescent plane ( , 100 nm proximity to the plasma membrane ) . Notably , ABD puncta are lost from the evanescent plane upon expression of GBF1 E794K , thus providing a direct link between GBF1 exchange activity , Arf1 activation at / close to the plasma membrane , and Arf1 - mediated endocytosis . GBF1 is known to cycle rapidly between membranes and cytosol ( t 1 / 2 , 17 s ; [ 46 ] ) . Membrane recruitment occurs via an unknown receptor ( s ) and is independent of Arf - GDP recruitment , while membrane dissociation occurs shortly after GTP exchange [ 46 , 48 ] . Sustained activation of Arf1 would require multiple rounds of GBF1 cycling and GTP exchange , as GBF1 cycles on / off membranes faster than Arf1 [ 46 ] . As such , the fraction of GBF1 associated with activated Arf1 at any point in space and time would be relatively small . We were able to detect this small fraction in the evanescent field with the aid of sensitive cameras and low expression levels of GBF1 and ABD . Since the majority of membrane - associated GBF1 and ABD was located in pericen - triolar Golgi and transitional ER compartments ( which rarely traverse the evanescent plane in TIRF imaging ) , good contrast was achievable near the plasma membrane where the concentration of GBF1 and ABD was relatively low . Since GBF1 was originally discovered as a GEF required for ER - Golgi transport in the secretory pathway [ 54 ] , its role in endocytosis as ascribed here is novel . Extending an earlier finding that Arf1 activation continues to be required for endocytosis even after disruption of the early secretory pathway with BFA [ 10 ] , we have shown here that the GEF activity of GBF1 is an additional requirement for this to occur . However , this raises the paradoxical issue of how GBF1 can still activate Arf1 in the presence of BFA , which is a non - competitive inhibitor that stabilizes a Arf - GDP - BFA - GEF complex , and causes morphological defects in vivo that mimic the loss of Arf1 - GTP ( [ 48 ] and refs . therein ) . As multiple GEFs can activate Arf1 , and several are targeted by BFA [ 13 ] , the routinely used concentrations of this drug may be sufficient to inhibit ER - Golgi traffic and disrupt Golgi complex morphology , GEEC Endocytosis in Drosophila PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 13 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6768 but may not inhibit all GBF1 activity in vivo . Equally , it is possible that GBF1 sensitivity to BFA is modulated by its membrane receptors , and the membrane recruitment of GBF1 at the ER - Golgi route is more sensitive to BFA than membrane recruitment at the plasma membrane . A third non - mutually exclusive possibility is that the presence of excess Arf1 that has been released from the ER - Golgi pool upon BFA addition stimulates GBF1 activity at the plasma membrane , which compensates for GBF inhibition . Identification and characterization of the receptor ( s ) and the membrane recruitment mechanism for GBF1 would help to distinguish between these possibilities . A role for GBF1 in endocytosis is not without precedent . In Arabidopsis , the GBF1 - ortholog GNL1 has a conserved role at the Golgi but is also required for BFA - insensitive endocytosis at the plasma membrane [ 55 ] . Moreover , the Drosophila GBF1 ortholog garz has been identified as a candidate in genomic screens which tested the entry and infection of the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes [ 56 ] and Candida albicans [ 57 , 58 ] . While direct involvement of candidate genes in pathogen entry was not tested in these screens , our finding that garz affects Arf1 - mediated endocytosis in Drosophila implicate this pathway as a mode of entry for these pathogens . There is growing evidence that Arf1 , GBF1 and part of the COPI machinery can be recruited not only onto transitional ER and the Golgi , but also onto other membranes where they can modulate trafficking or modify membranes ( replication complexes during picornaviral infection - [ 59 , 60 ] ; lipid bodies – [ 61 , 62 ] . While both replication complexes and lipid bodies are probably ER - derived membranes [ 63 , 64 ] , our results suggest that Arf1 and GBF1 may also act together during endocytic events at the plasma membrane . In this regard , it would be interesting to test the involvement of components of the COPI machinery in Arf1 - mediated endocytosis . Conclusion The availability of heterologous gene expression and functional genomic RNAi in the S2R + line , combined with high - resolution imaging promises to be a powerful approach to study endocytosis in Drosophila . These methods have allowed us to systematically identify and define the role of a novel molecule in GEEC endocytosis . The demonstration of conserved pathways in Drosophila indicates that these findings can be broadly applicable . Supporting Information Figure S1 Automated quantitation of uptake assay measure - ments . ( A ) High penetrance of a dsRNA induced phenotype in S2R + cells cultured on dishes . Images taken from a single field of S2R + cells treated with control dsRNA or dsRNA against pavarotti , which encodes a kinesin like protein required for cytokinesis [ 1 ] . Note the accumulation of abnormally large multinucleate cells with pavarotti dsRNA as shown in the brightfield / Hoechst - stained nuclear channels . ( B ) Stepwise proce - dure for performing automated cell identification using the MATLAB image processing toolbox . The nuclear image ( Hoechst ) is thresholded using Otsu’s method [ 2 ] and an empirically - determined correction factor to create a binary mask ( nuclear binary mask ) . This binary mask is subjected to a Euclidean distance transform followed by a watershed transform , generating the first crude stage of cell segmentation ( nuclear distance transform , ndt ) . A Sobel edge - detection filter is applied to the Okt9 surface label image ( Okt9 ) to enhance cell boundaries . The watershed and the nuclear mask are superimposed upon the enhanced Okt9 image as local minima ( local minima of ndt + Okt9 ) . A final watershed transform is applied to this combined image to generate cell outlines which are then filled in ( surface mask ) . ( C ) Scatterplot comparing the performance of automated intensity / cell quantitation vs manual quantitation . 24 dishes were pulsed with Fdex for different times to generate a , 10fold range of fluorescence intensity values across cells . Each point represents the mean 6 s . e . m . intensity / cell in a dish ( with measurements from . 100 cells from each dish ) calculated manually or via MATLAB routines . The two methods show linear correlation over a wide range of cell intensities . Bar in A = 20 m m , B = 5 m m . References : 1 . Adams , R .
