The Effect of Stimulus Modes and Associative Distance in Individual Creativity Support Systems Ross A . Malaga malaga @ umbc . edu Department of Information Systems University of Maryland , Baltimore County , Baltimore , MD 21250 Abstract A laboratory experiment was conducted in order to explore the role of stimulus modes and associative distance in individual creativity support systems . Pictorial and lexical stimuli were used to elicit ideas in response to a specific task . These stimuli were either mediated or remotely associated with the problem task . The creativity , quality , and total number of ideas were analyzed . Differing stimulus modes did not result in significant findings . However , the use of both mediated and remote stimuli did lead to a greater number of ideas than the use of no stimuli . 1 . Introduction The value of producing new ideas is significant in almost any field . The value is obvious in science and technology research , as well as product development and marketing . An article in Asian Business stated recently , “the cash cow of the future is creativity [ 1 ] ” . Clearly , the value of creative output in all aspects of business has been given increased importance . Many top companies , such as Coca - Cola , DuPont , and 3M actively encourage employees to generate new ideas [ 2 ] . Other companies are capitalizing on this need by offering creativity training and materials , such as books and tapes . The need for creativity is not limited to the traditional creative occupations ( i . e . , artists , marketing , etc . ) . A literature search of the INSPEC database of engineering and information systems journals , for 1997 , on the subject of creativity produced 84 citations . The results of a similar search on the ABII database of business journals produced 328 citations . In addition , books such as John Kao ' s Jamming : The Art and Discipline of Business Creativity [ 3 ] , have become very popular among business executives ( Kao ' s book spent time on the Business Week bestseller list ) . Software companies have begun to produce material that they claim can aid in the creative process . In their search for creativity , some companies have begun investing in these products [ 4 ] . One popular type of software tool that may help the creative process is group decision support systems ( GDSS ) . These systems provide for the electronic mediation of group idea generation sessions . There is much evidence to support the notion that GDSS actually improve the creative output of group idea generation [ 5 - 10 ] . One of the main drawbacks to GDSS is that they are specifically designed to be used by a group . They provide no support for individuals who need to generate ideas . Therefore , some software companies and academics have begun to develop decision support systems ( DSS ) that provide support for individual idea generation . Unfortunately , none of the handful of studies [ 11 - 14 ] so far carried out in this field has addressed specific user interface issues . In order to improve the reliability and usefulness of individual creativity support systems ( ICSS ) , studies into the role of the user interface in these systems must be conducted . 2 . Theoretical Background Most of the commercial and academic ICSS systems make use of only lexical stimuli in order to help the user generate new ideas . However , words may not be the best stimulus mode to use . There is much evidence to support the notion that mental imagery plays an important role in idea generation [ 15 - 18 ] . In addition , it is known that individuals who have a natural ability to generate and manipulate mental images may prefer to use pictorial stimuli in problem solving tasks [ 19 ] . 2 . 1 . The Role of Imagery in Creative Thinking Much of the early literature on the role of mental imagery in creative thought was based on anecdotal evidence [ 16 , 20 ] . One famous story relates the development of the special theory of relativity to Einstein imagining himself traveling beside a light wave . In another story Kekule discovers the ring structure of the benzene molecule after dreaming about a snake swallowing its own tail . Proceedings of the 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 1999 0 - 7695 - 0001 - 3 / 99 $ 10 . 00 ( c ) 1999 IEEE Proceedings of the 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 1999 1 More recently , experimental studies have shown that mental imagery and the use of pictures does play a role in solving some types of problems . Most of the problems examined to date have been those that require a high degree of mental manipulation of images and those that are highly spatial in nature [ 15 ] . Shepard [ 16 ] suggested a number of reasons why imagery influences creative problem solving ; 1 . The use of imagery provides an alternative to the traditional , language based , way of thinking . 2 . The rich content provided by imagery and its link to external sources may suggest ideas and trends of thought that are not “fully preserved by language” [ 15 ] . 3 . Images are more likely to produce positive affect and motivation than language . There is some empirical evidence to support Shepard ' s ideas . For example , mental imagery may play a role in alleviating functional fixedness . Duncker suggested that in attempting to solve certain problems , subjects became fixated on a certain type of solution . The fixated subjects did not consider other types of solutions , even when the other solution was better [ 21 ] . Kaufmann [ 22 ] has speculated that mental images are processed by the brain in a parallel fashion ; allowing for the simultaneous consideration of the entire problem . Thus reducing functional fixedness . Alessandro Antonietti ( in [ 23 ] ) performed a series of experiments designed to determine the effect of pictorial representations and mental imagery on overcoming functional fixedness . He had subjects solve mathematical word problems . He found that use of mental visualization had a significant effect in overcoming functional fixedness . In another experiment he found that the use of pictures was useful in solving problems that have many steps . A possible theoretical explanation for these results and the body of anecdotal evidence can be found in Paivio ' s dual coding theory and Mednick ' s associative theory of creativity . 2 . 2 . Dual Coding Theory Dual coding theory as put forth by Paivio [ 24 , 25 ] : “…is based on the assumption that memory and cognition are served by two separate symbolic systems , one specialized for dealing with verbal information and the other for nonverbal information . The two systems are presumed to be interconnected but capable of functioning independently . Interconnectedness means that representations in one system can activate those in the other , so that for example , pictures can be named and images can occur to words . Independence implies , among other things , that nonverbal ( imaginal ) and verbal memory codes , aroused directly by pictures and words or indirectly by imagery and verbal encoding tasks , should have additive effects on recall . ” Paivio further theorizes that each system ( verbal and nonverbal ) has its own associative network . Since the systems are interconnected , verbal and nonverbal associations may occur . Paivio referred to this type of association as referential reference [ 26 ] . The interaction between direct association ( verbal to verbal , nonverbal to nonverbal ) and referential reference has made empirical study of these effects very difficult . However , some studies [ 27 ] have revealed evidence to support these effects . Figure 1 ( adapted from [ 25 ] ) provides an example of dual coding theory . In the figure the image of the dog causes an associative response in the image system . The word " dog " causes a similar response in the verbal system . Each word in the verbal system may have a referential relation in the image system . Not all words and images will have a referential relation . It should be noted that the word " dog " and an image of a dog may produce different associative responses . For example , an image of a German Shepherd may result in an association with a guard dog . This association may then lead to the image of a guard in uniform .

Paivio ' s dual coding theory Based on experimental data Paivio has further concluded that the use of pictures and words together have an additive effect on the ability to recall an associate from memory [ 28 ] . Numerous studies , dating back over 100 years to Galton [ 29 ] , have shown that there are differences in individual verbal and nonverbal abilities [ 27 , 30 ] . In general , individuals who are better “visualizers” ( often referred to as high imagers ) will prefer to use imagery strategies in problem solving . Low imagers will generally prefer to use a verbal strategy [ 19 ] . While dual coding theory has its opponents ( [ 31 ] for example ) , many empirical studies have provided positive evidence for the theory [ 28 ] . Many of the early studies dealt with a subject ' s ability to manipulate mental images and recall associates based on lexical or pictorial stimuli Proceedings of the 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 1999 0 - 7695 - 0001 - 3 / 99 $ 10 . 00 ( c ) 1999 IEEE Proceedings of the 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 1999 2 [ 15 , 28 , 30 ] . More recent studies [ 32 ] have used positron emission topography ( PET ) scans to show that the cerebral hemispheres differ in their ability to process lexical and pictorial material . 2 . 3 . Associative Theory of Creativity The associative connections suggested by the dual coding theory may allow for the generation of new ideas . Margaret Boden states , " many cases of creativity depend , at least in part , on the mind ' s associative power " [ 33 ] . The idea of associative thinking provides the basis for brainstorming , a popular group idea generation technique [ 34 ] . Bouchard states that brainstorming is “facilitated by other group members who provide unique stimuli which constantly prod the associative mechanism , thereby generating more and better suggestions [ 35 p . 12 ] . Associative theory contends that mental states are joined to each other in such a way that one state “tends to evoke the other’ [ 36 ] . For example , thinking about a fork may tend to evoke the mental state for knife , spoon , or food . Mednick contends that associative thinking may lead to new ideas [ 37 ] . The associative response might not end after one association . For example , a person might make an associative connection between fork and ill fated cruise ships . The connection occurs through a series of associations ( fork - > trident - > Poseidon - > the Poseidon Adventure ) . Mednick speculated that the greater the “distance” between associative elements the greater the possibility of a creative response . Mednick also noted that “visualizers” and “verbalizers” will tend to produce different types of associations . “Visualizers” , those people who are adept at generating and manipulating mental images , will have difficulty in producing creative solutions if the problem has a highly verbal component . " Verbalizers” , those people who are not adept at generating and manipulating mental images , will have a similar difficulty handling problems that have a highly visual component . An important aspect of Mednick ' s theory of associative creativity is the concept of associative hierarchy . An associative hierarchy is the strength and organization of an individual ' s associations . Consider the example in figure 2 , which shows two associative hierarchies around the word " table " . Mednick predicts that those individuals with a relatively flat associative hierarchies are more creative than those with steep hierarchies . The person with a steep hierarchy has a very strong association between " table " and the typical responses of " chair " and " cloth " . It is difficult for this person to recall the more remote associates ( i . e . , leg and food ) . According to Mednick , these remote associates are more likely to lead to a creative response . The person with a flatter associative hierarchy may still have a strong associative connection between " table " and " chair " , but this stereotypical connection is not overly dominant . This person will more easily recall the remote associates . Associative hierarchies around the word " table " Chair Cloth Wood Leg Food Flat Associative Hierarchy Steep Associative Hierarchy Figure 2 . Associative hierarchies 2 . 4 . Conclusions from the Literature This discussion leads to the following conclusions : • The use of mental imagery will lead to more creative ideas , • The modality of stimuli ( language , images , etc . ) will cause a different associative response , • A pictorial stimulus is more likely to generate mental imagery associations than a language stimulus , • Remote stimuli are more likely to lead to the generation of creative ideas than mediated stimuli , • Mediated stimuli are more likely to lead to the generation of a greater number of ideas than remote stimuli . Therefore , the use of both stimuli should produce an increase in the number , variety , and novelty of solutions generated in response to a particular problem . More solutions can be generated because the use of both verbal and nonverbal systems allows for a larger number of associations . This greater number of available associations should lead to a greater variety of solutions generated and more novel solutions . 3 . Purpose of this Research Individual creativity enhancing decision support systems ( ICSS ) have used primarily lexical stimuli to promote idea generation . However , the conclusions from the psychological literature suggest that use of multiple stimulus modes , specifically lexical and pictorial , may produce better results . These conclusions lead to the following hypotheses : Proceedings of the 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 1999 0 - 7695 - 0001 - 3 / 99 $ 10 . 00 ( c ) 1999 IEEE Proceedings of the 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 1999 3 H1 : The use of both lexical and pictorial stimuli in an ICSS will result in a greater number of ideas being produced for a specific problem task than the use of an ICSS that uses only one stimulus mode or no stimuli , H2 : The use of both lexical and pictorial stimuli in an ICSS will result in a higher level of creative ideas being produced for a specific problem task than the use of an ICSS that uses only one stimulus mode or no stimuli , H3 : The use of both lexical and pictorial stimuli in an ICSS will result in a higher level of good ideas being produced for a specific problem task than the use of an ICSS that uses only one stimulus mode or no stimuli . If these hypotheses are correct , then they have a direct impact on the way in which ICSS are designed . Specifically , ICSS should use both lexical and pictorial stimuli . The reasons for this is that the inclusion of pictorial stimuli will encourage imagery associations , which have been shown to play a positive role in creative thinking . The role of the associative distance of the stimuli must also be considered due to the implications for the design of ICSS . Mednick theorizes that remote associates will generate more creative ideas ; however , remote stimuli may lead to the generation of fewer ideas . The following hypotheses relate to associative distance : H4 : The use of mediated stimuli in an ICSS will result in a greater number of ideas being produced for a specific problem task than the use of an ICSS that uses remote stimuli or no stimuli , H5 : The use of remote stimuli in an ICSS will result in a higher level of creative ideas being produced for a specific problem task than the use of an ICSS that uses mediated stimuli or no stimuli , Based on the literature , no hypothesis could be formed concerning the impact of associative distance on idea quality . If these hypotheses are correct , it is preferable for the developer of an ICSS package to use remote stimuli . This would allow the product to be used for non - domain specific idea generation . 4 . The Experiment A laboratory experiment was conducted aimed at providing guidance in the use of stimulus modes and associative distance in ICSS . 4 . 1 . Experimental Design The experiment used a 3X3 design with one control . The two independent variables were : mode of stimuli and associative distance of stimuli . The three stimuli modes used were : pictorial , lexical , and both pictorial and lexical . The three associative distances of stimuli used were : mediated , remote , and both mediated and remote . The control treatment did not use any stimuli . The three dependent variables in this experiment are ; total number of ideas generated , the creativity of the ideas , and the quality of the ideas .

Experimental Task The problem task used in this experiment was : “Produce a list of as many new delicious ice cream flavors as possible” While this problem may seem ( and probably is ) very simple it was chosen for a number of reasons . First , most people have had some experience with ice cream and require no specialized knowledge in order to develop new ideas concerning ice cream flavors . Second , the task is open - ended . Third , the creativity and quality of the ideas can be simply judged by a group of ice cream lovers . These people require no specialized knowledge or training and the judging group can consist of many people . Finally , while the basic problem is simple , it does emulate some real world problems . Many organizations are involved in developing new products or variations of currently existing products . 4 . 3 . Software Used in Experiment Microsoft Access ' 97™ was used to develop the software used in the experiment . Access was chosen due to its ease in creating a graphical user interface and its database support . The database was used to store stimulus words and images . For those treatments that used stimuli , the user interaction screen was divided into three sections ( see figure 3 ) . A statement of the problem task appeared at the top of the screen . The right side of the screen contained an area for subjects to type their ideas . The left side of the screen displayed the stimulus .

Sample screen from experimental software The stimulus changed based on an internal timer and user action . Each stimulus was displayed for a minimum of ten seconds . After the timer had expired the next stimulus was displayed when the user pressed the TAB key . Therefore , if the timer had expired and the subject pressed the TAB key to move the cursor to a new idea text box , the next stimulus in the database was displayed . In addition , the user could advance the stimulus display by pressing the TAB key before typing anything in the current idea text box , as long as the timer had expired . This method for advancing the stimulus was suggested by a pilot study group . The control treatment used the same basic software as the other treatments . However , in the control treatment the display area was divided into only two parts . The top of the screen displayed a statement of the problem task . The middle of the screen contained are area for the user to input ideas . 4 . 3 . 1 Stimuli Used in the Software Before choosing the specific stimuli , both lexical and pictorial , to use in the above mentioned software an extensive review of the literature was undertaken . However , the previous body of knowledge provided no guidance in this matter . The central problem with using associative stimuli is that every subject will produce different associations . Therefore the following criteria were used to select stimuli for the software : • The use of abstract stimuli was avoided . Abstract terms ( e . g . , love , truth , happiness , etc . ) do not lend themselves to an easily understood pictorial representation . In addition , abstract pictures are difficult to describe in lexical terms . Therefore , in order to match pictorial stimuli with lexical stimuli abstract stimuli were avoided . • The use of stimuli with a weak pictorial element was avoided . In order to directly compare lexical and pictorial stimuli with the same semantic meaning , stimuli words that did not have a strong pictorial element were excluded . • The use of stimuli directly associated with the problem domain was avoided . Mednick points out that this type of association is unlikely to produce original ideas [ 37 ] . • Stimuli that are mediated ( closely associated ) or remotely associated with the problem domain were used . According to Mednick remote associations are most likely to produce original ideas [ 37 ] . However , it was anticipated that subjects would have difficulty generating ideas using remote associates . Therefore , mediated associative elements were also used . The stimulus elements were chosen using the following process ; • A group of subjects from the overall subject pool were asked to produce a list of direct associations in response to the problem domain . This was accomplished by asking the subjects to write down the first thing they think of when they hear the problem domain ( in this case when they hear the term ice cream ) . This task generated a list of twenty non - duplicate responses . • The list of direct associates was then be presented to another group of subjects randomly chosen from the overall subject pool . This group was asked to produce a list of new direct associations in response to the original list . The result of this process was a list of 323 non - duplicate mediated associations to the original problem domain . • Two raters were then asked to determine which of the mediated lexical stimuli had a strong pictorial element . Each rater performed this task individually . The results were then compared and the raters asked to resolve any differences . The final list included 195 mediated stimuli with a strong pictorial element . • Each of the 195 mediated stimuli words was queried against a database of 50 , 000 pictures . Where a picture existed it was added to the Access database . • The remote associates were generated by choosing random words from the dictionary . As each word was chosen it was queried against the picture database . If a picture was found then the word and picture were added to the Access database . If no picture was found then the word was discarded .

Subjects The 120 subjects came from a pool of volunteer students at George Mason University . The subjects were all students enrolled in a spreadsheet software course . The level of computer experience in this group ranged from very little , to expert . Students were asked to sign up to participate on one of four days . Since there was no benefit to the student to sign up for a particular day , this process produced randomized treatments with 30 subjects in each . A normal distribution of subjects over each of the four main treatments was assumed with respect to inherent creative ability , high and low visualization ability , and typing speed and accuracy . 4 . 5 . Experimental Procedures The experiment was conducted over four consecutive Saturday mornings . Experimental sessions for treatments using the same stimuli mode were combined , as the instructions for these treatments were the same . For example , all of the treatments that used only pictures were tested at the same time . Upon arrival at the experiment site , a computer laboratory at George Mason University , the experiment proceeded as follows : • Subjects were assigned to a computer running the experimental software . • The initial screen asked subjects to wait for verbal instructions . The experimenter provided verbal instructions on the use of the software and showed a demonstration on a display in the front of the room . • The subjects were then given a short practice task to work on in order to ensure they knew how to use the software . • When all subjects had indicated they were comfortable with the software , the experimenter presented the experimental task . • Subjects were given seven and a half minutes to generate ideas . Subjects were aware that there was a time limit , but did not know the amount of time allocated for the task . • At the end of seven and a half minutes subjects were given the opportunity to complete typing any idea they were working on . • Subjects were then thanked for their participation and dismissed . • The results from each workstation were copied to floppy disk and collected . No major problems were encountered while conducting the experiment . 4 . 6 Data Analysis Techniques In addition to standard statistical analysis , the creativity and quality of the ideas generated during the experiment was assessed by three independent judges . Each judge was asked to rate the creativity and goodness of each idea generated during the experiment . The rating for each was based on a five point continuous scale . Judges could rate the creativity and quality of each ideas as ; very low , low , medium , high , or very high . These responses were transformed into a numeric score from one to five , where a score of one indicated a response of " very low " and a score of five indicated a response of " very high " . Each judge was randomly assigned to complete either the creativity or quality rating first . Once the first rating was complete the judge was asked to complete the second rating . In each rating the ideas were presented to the judges in a randomized order . These procedures are consistent with Amabile ' s consensual assessment technique ( CAT ) [ 38 ] . The CAT has been shown to be highly reliable in dozens of empirical studies [ 38 ] . 5 . Results 5 . 1 . Reliability of Judges The inter - rater reliability of the judges was determined using Cronbach ' s alpha coefficient , as calculated using the SPSS™ software package . The coefficient of correlation was . 65 for creativity and . 78 for quality . Both measures of correlation were above the . 60 level desired for the experiment . 5 . 2 . Number of Ideas The hypothesis ( H1 ) that the use of both pictorial and lexical stimuli would lead to a greater number of ideas generated , was tested by calculating the mean number of ideas generated in each treatment . The results of this calculation appear in table 2 . An analysis of variance indicates that the hypothesis is not supported ( F 3 , 119 = 2 . 027 , p = . 114 ) . However , the data ( see table 3 ) reveals that differences in associative distances ( H4 ) do significantly impact the number of ideas generated ( F 3 , 116 = 3 . 305 , p = . 023 ) . See table 4 for the complete ANOVA . Tukey ' s post - hoc test reveals that the use of both mediated and remote stimuli result in a greater number of ideas than the use of no stimuli ( p = . 036 ) .

Creativity The creativity of ideas produced in the main treatments was analyzed by calculating the mean creativity score , across the three judges , for each idea generated . The results of this analysis appear in table 5 . An analysis of variance using the F test revealed the hypothesis that the use of both pictorial and lexical stimuli would produce a higher level of creativity ( H2 ) was not supported ( F 3 , 119 = . 238 , p = . 87 ) . The results for creativity in each associative distance ( H5 ) are reported in table 6 .

Idea Quality The quality of ideas produced in the main treatments was analyzed by calculating the mean quality score , across the three judges , for each idea generated .

An analysis of variance reveals that hypothesis 3 , that the use of both pictorial and lexical stimuli will produce higher quality ideas , is not supported ( F 3 , 119 = 1 . 637 , p = . 185 ) . While no hypothesis was formed concerning the role of associative distance on quality , this data was analyzed to see if any conclusions could be reached ( see table 8 ) . There was no significant difference in quality scores with respect to associative distance ( F 3 , 119 = 1 . 947 , p = . 126 ) . Table 7 . Quality score for each stimulus mode Treatment N Mean Std .

Limitations of Study The creativity and quality measures may have been influenced by the unexpectedly large number of ideas , over 1500 , that needed to be judged . All of the judges complained that there were too many ideas . They all indicated that they felt they became increasingly critical as they went through the judging process . They also noticed a tendency to rate more ideas in the medium range the farther along they went . In addition , the fact that many of the subjects were from various cultures , while the judges were all culturally heterogeneous may have skewed the results .

Conclusions and Future Research This study has taken a first step in exploring the role of stimulus modes and associative distance in individual creativity enhancing decision support systems . None of the hypotheses were supported by the data . However , the problems encountered in judging the ideas generated may explain this lack of support . Therefore , the author is currently reassessing the data gathered during the experiment using a randomly selected subset of the data . In addition , judges from a wide variety of cultures are being recruited . The only significant finding was that the use of both mediated and remote stimuli produced a significantly greater number of ideas than using no stimuli . This finding may impact the way in which both GDSS and ICSS are designed . Most ICSS packages use non - domain specific stimuli , while many GDSS sessions are domain specific . Based on the findings presented above , it may prove useful for each type of creativity enhancing system to use both domain specific and remote stimuli . Exactly how this type of system can be implemented is an area for future research . In addition to the research opportunities mentioned above , additional research into the area of ICSS needs to be conducted . Specific recommendations for future research include : • The results of the experiment with respect to the number of ideas generated indicate that all treatments that used stimuli produced more ideas than the control . However , this result was not statistically significant . A potential reason for this result may be the arbitrary time limit imposed upon the subjects . This experiment should be repeated with no pre - set time limit . The purpose of this proposed experiment would be to fully explore the number of ideas generated . • The study should be repeated using multiple and diverse tasks . Specifically , complex tasks , requiring specialized knowledge should be explored ( with the proper subjects and judges ) . In addition , tasks that have a high spatial or visual element should be compared with those that do not . • The preference and usefulness of stimuli modes for high and low imagers needs to be fully explored . An experiment should be conducted to explore stimuli mode preference for high versus low imagers .
