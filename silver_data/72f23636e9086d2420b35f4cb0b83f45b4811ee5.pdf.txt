Cárdenas 1 * 1 Centro Interdisciplinario de Neurociencia de Valparaíso , Facultad de Ciencias , Universidad de Valparaíso , Valparaíso , Chile , 2 Departamento de Microbiología ( Inmunología ) , Facultad de Medicina , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , Madrid , Spain Upon cell stimulation , the network of cortical actin ﬁlaments is rearranged to facilitate the neurosecretory process . This actin rearrangement includes both disruption of the preexisting actin network and de novo actin polymerization . However , the mechanism by which a Ca 2 + signal elicits the formation of new actin ﬁlaments remains uncertain . Cortactin , an actin - binding protein that promotes actin polymerization in synergy with the nucleation promoting factor N - WASP , could play a key role in this mechanism . We addressed this hypothesis by analyzing de novo actin polymerization and exocytosis in bovine adrenal chromafﬁn cells expressing different cortactin or N - WASP domains , or cortactin mutants that fail to interact with proline - rich domain ( PRD ) - containing proteins , including N - WASP , or to be phosphorylated by Ca 2 + - dependent kinases , such as ERK1 / 2 and Src . Our results show that the activation of nicotinic receptors in chromafﬁn cells promotes cortactin translocation to the cell cortex , where it colocalizes with actin ﬁlaments . We further found that , in association with PRD - containing proteins , cortactin contributes to the Ca 2 + - dependent formation of F - actin , and regulates fusion pore dynamics and the number of exocytotic events induced by activation of nicotinic receptors . However , whereas the actions of cortactin on the fusion pore dynamics seems to depend on the availability of monomeric actin and its phosphorylation by ERK1 / 2 and Src kinases , cortactin regulates the extent of exocytosis by a mechanism independent of actin polymerization . Together our ﬁndings point out a role for cortactin as a critical modulator of actin ﬁlament formation and exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells .

Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis INTRODUCTION The exocytotic release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is a highly regulated process triggered by a rise in cytosolic Ca 2 + , and that relies on the formation of the SNARE complex as well as the Ca 2 + sensor synaptotagmin ( Südhof , 2013 ) . During the fusion process a narrow channel called “fusion pore” is formed . This channel remains open for a variable period of time . Initially , it allows the slow outﬂow of small molecules ( Zhou et al . , 1996 ) ; later , it can expand leading to the massive release of the vesicular content or alternatively , it can close again resulting in the partial release of the transmitter molecules stored in the vesicle lumen ( Alés et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , the temporal pattern and amount of transmitter released under diﬀerent physiological conditions could be tightly regulated by the size and lifetime of the fusion pore ( Cárdenas and Marengo , 2016 ) . In neurosecretory cells , the cortical F - actin meshwork is dynamically remodeled following stimuli that elevate cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations ( Wollman and Meyer , 2012 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . In this regard , Ca 2 + concentrations that induce exocytosis promote disruption of the preexisting cortical actin network , as well as formation of new actin ﬁlaments ( Trifaró et al . , 2000 ; Gasman et al . , 2004 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . This actin remodeling modulates diﬀerent steps of the secretory process , including the formation of active exocytotic sites ( Torregrosa - Hetland et al . , 2011 ; Gabel et al . , 2015 ) , the motion of the vesicles to those sites ( Giner et al . , 2005 ; Papadopulos et al . , 2013 ) , and the kinetics ( Berberian et al . , 2009 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) and mode of exocytosis ( Doreian et al . , 2008 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . Nevertheless , the mechanism by which a Ca 2 + signal elicits the formation of actin ﬁlaments remains poorly understood . Cortactin is an F - actin binding protein that regulates F - actin dynamics during plasma membrane remodeling processes such as endocytosis ( Cao et al . , 2010 ) and formation of growth cones , lamellipodia , podosomes , and invadopodia ( Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ) . Cortactin also coordinates cellular signaling involved in mechanical forces generated by actin polymerization , as observed during axon outgrowth ( Kubo et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , cortactin is phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine residues by Ca 2 + - activated kinases , such as the extracellular signal - regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) and Src ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Both types of phosphorylation determine cortactin activity as well as its association with proteins such as the N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Tehrani et al . , 2007 ; Kelley et al . , 2011 ) , an actin NPF that accumulates at exocytosis sites together with the Arp2 / 3 nucleation complex and F - actin ( Gasman et al . , 2004 ) . In ACCs , both ERK1 / 2 and Src kinases are activated by secretagogues and regulate exocytosis ( Allen et al . , 1996 ; Cox and Parsons , 1997 ; Mendoza et al . , 2003 ) . As we recently reported , Src kinases also control Ca 2 + - dependent actin polymerization and fusion pore lifetime in ACCs ( Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , as a substrate of these Ca 2 + - activated kinases , cortactin could play a role in coordinating Ca 2 + signals with F - actin dynamics and exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells . Here , we show that cortactin promotes Ca 2 + - dependent actin polymerization and regulates the last steps of exocytosis in ACCs . The mechanism involves the association of cortactin - SH3 domain to PRD - containing proteins and cortactin phosphorylation at serine and tyrosine residues .

Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis The Myc - tagged construct of the N - WASP region WGP ( amino acids 1 – 396 ) encompassing the PRD of N - WASP and lacking the active VCA domain , was previously described by Rohatgi et al . ( 2000 ) . Peptides Microinjection , Transfections , and Pharmacological Treatments Adrenal chromaﬃn cells were injected with 5 µ M of the GST - fusion peptides of cortactin SH3 , SH3W525K or the N - WASP PRD by using an InjectMan system ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) and 0 . 5 µ m - diameter Femtotips ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) . All GST - peptides were injected in a buﬀer solution containing in mM : 139 K + - glutamate , 20 PIPES , 5 EGTA , 2 ATP - Mg 2 + , pH 6 . 6 , in the presence of 4 % Lucifer yellow , a ﬂuorescent dye that allowed us to identify the injected cells . The injection time was 0 . 2 s at a pressure of 120 hPa . Then , ACCs were kept in the culture medium at 37 ◦ C for 30 min . For transfections , ACCs were electroporated using an Amaxa Nucleofector 4D ( Lonza , Cologne , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After transfection , ACCs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed F - 12 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and kept at 37 ◦ C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere , for at least 48 h prior to experimentation . To study the role of actin polymerization in exocytosis , ACCs were incubated with 2 µ M Latrunculin A ( LatA ) , or its vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) 10 min prior to experimentation and throughout the test . To evaluate the role of ERK1 / 2 signaling in exocytosis , ACCs were incubated with 10 µ M of U0126 , or its inactive analog U0124 , 15 min prior to experimentation and throughout the test . Immunoﬂuorescence For immunocytochemistry , cultured ACCs were kept at a resting condition or stimulated with 50 µ M of the nicotinic agonist DMPP for 20 s , ﬁxed with 4 % p - formaldehyde in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 15 min at 4 ◦ C and permeabilized with a ﬁxative solution containing 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 . Then , the samples were blocked with 3 % bovine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against cortactin ( 1 : 100 ) overnight at 4 ◦ C and an anti - mouse Cy2 conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 250 ) for 1 h at room temperature . Next , after several washes with PBS , samples were incubated with 5 mg / ml DAPI for 15 min . Finally , samples were processed for immunoﬂuorescence and visualized by confocal microscopy ( Eclipse Nikon80i ; Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) , using a 100x oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 46 ) . Images were captured , using identical exposure settings between compared samples ( typically power 50 % , gain 7 . 8 and pinhole 60 µ m for the laser 408 ; power 55 % , gain 7 . 7 and pinhole 60 um for the laser 488 , and power 51 % , gain 7 . 5 and pinhole 60 um for the laser 543 ) . All confocal images were acquired at the equatorial plane of the cell and quantiﬁcations were done at this focal plane . For colocalization of cortactin with actin ﬁlaments , the samples were additionally incubated with 1 µ M of the F - actin - binding toxin phalloidin - tetramethyl - rhodamine - B - isothiocyanate ( phalloidin - TRITC ) for 15 min after the incubation with the anti - mouse Cy2 conjugated secondary antibody and then visualized by confocal microscopy . Actin Polymerization Assay In order to analyze the formation of new actin ﬁlaments , we performed a previously described de novo actin polymerization assay ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . Brieﬂy , cultured ACCs were permeabilized with 20 µ M digitonin in a buﬀer containing in mM : 139 K - glutamate , 20 PIPES , 5 EGTA , 2 ATP - Mg 2 + , pH 6 . 6 , in the presence of 10 µ M free Ca 2 + and 0 . 3 µ M Alexa Fluor 488 - G - actin conjugate . Then samples were ﬁxed with PFA , stained with 5 mg / ml DAPI and visualized by confocal microscopy . When speciﬁed , the assay was performed in the presence of the diﬀerent GST - fusion or Myc - tagged peptides at a concentration of 100 nM . All images were captured at the equatorial plane of the cells , using identical exposure settings between compared samples . Confocal images were analyzed and processed using the ImageJ software ( NIH , USA ) . Amperometric Recordings The amperometry set - up consists of an inverted ﬂuorescence microscope ( Diaphot - 200 , Nikon , Japan ) , equipped with a mercury lamp and a FICT ﬁlter set ( B - 2A , Nikon , Japan ) , that allows us to identify cells transfected with EGFP constructs or injected with Lucifer yellow . Exocytosis was monitored as previously described ( Ardiles et al . , 2006 ) using 5 - µ m - diameter carbon ﬁbers ( Thornel P - 55 ; Amoco , Greenville , SC , USA ) and a patch clamp ampliﬁer ( EPC - 10 USB ; HEKA Electronics , Lambrecht , Germany ) . The amperometric signal was low - pass ﬁltered at 1 KHz and digitalized at 10 KHz with the acquisition software PatchMaster ( HEKA Electronics , Lambrecht , Germany ) . During recordings , cultured ACCs were perfused with a Krebs - Hepes solution ( mM : 140 NaCl , 5 . 9 KCl , 1 . 2 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 4 ) and exocytosis was induced by a 10 s pressure ejection of 50 µ M of DMPP . Data Analysis Confocal images were processed and analyzed using the open access software Image - J ( NIH , USA ) . For determining translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex , we ﬁrst manually drew the cell outline using the diﬀerential interference contrast ( DIC ) image of each cell to determine the cell area , and measure the TF of each individual cell . We repeated the same process , but drawing 1 µ m under the cell periphery , providing the NCF . Finally , the cortical area was obtained by subtracting NCF from TF . This 1 µ m annular region corresponds to F - actin - enriched cortex ( Doreian et al . , 2008 ; Berberian et al . , 2009 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . The data are represented as the ratio of CF / TF . For cortactin / F - actin colocalization analysis the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient was measured from each split channel after background subtraction . Fluorescence background was subtracted from a 2x2 pixel region outside the cells using the “ROI background subtraction” plugin of the ImageJ software . Two standard deviations of background from mean ﬂuorescence intensity were typically subtracted .

Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis Amperometric spikes were analyzed using locally written macros for IGOR ( Wavemetrics , Lake Oswego , OR , USA ) ( Segura et al . , 2000 ) ; this macro can be free downloaded from http : / / rborges . webs . ull . es / protocols - and - software / . The analysis was restricted to spikes with amplitudes ≥ 10 pA , foot amplitudes ≥ 3 pA and foot durations ≥ 3 ms . Each amperometric parameter was statistically analyzed by taking the median values from individual cells and then averaging these values per treatment group . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined utilizing one - way ANOVA followed by an unpaired t - test ( two - tails ) . Ethics Statement The present work includes the use of bovine adrenal glands obtained from the Frigoriﬁc Don Pedro slaughterhouse ( Quilpué , Chile ) , certiﬁed by the Agriculture and Livestock Service of the Chilean Government ( certiﬁcate number : 04 . 2 . 03 . 0002 ) and regularly inspected by a Chilean Health Service veterinarian . Transport , processing , and elimination of the samples were carried out in strict accordance with the Article 86 of the Sanitary Regulations of the Chilean Government ( Supreme decree N ◦ 977 / 96 ) .

RESULTS Cortactin Colocalizes with Actin Filament in Stimulated Chromafﬁn Cells Cortactin is a cytosolic protein that is recruited to the cell cortex to promote cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling ( Weed et al . , 1998 ; Lua and Low , 2005 ; Jacobson et al . , 2006 ) . Since the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors triggers exocytosis in chromaﬃn cells , we analyzed cortactin distribution upon stimulation with the nicotinic agonist DMPP . In resting cells , cortactin is mainly localized in the cytosol , but a fraction of the cortactin staining was found to be localized in the cell cortex ( Figure 1A ) . Quantiﬁed as a ratio between cortical and total cell cortactin intensity , the fraction of cortactin in the cell cortex in resting condition was 0 . 2 ± 0 . 02 ( 8 – 10 cells per culture from four diﬀerent cultures ) . In cells stimulated with DMPP ( 50 µ M for 20 s ) , this fraction signiﬁcantly increased ( p < 0 . 05 ) , reaching a value of 0 . 35 ± 0 . 04 ( 8 – 10 cells per culture from four diﬀerent cultures ) . Given the role of cortactin in the remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton , we also examined whether cortactin colocalizes with actin ﬁlaments in the DMPP - stimulated condition . Therefore , we stained ACCs with the cortactin - directed antibody and with phalloidin - TRITC - B - isothiocyanate ( Figure 1B ) . The degree of colocalization between the two labels was analyzed by using the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient . This analysis indicated that cortactin colocalizes with cortical actin ﬁlaments ( Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of 0 . 61 ± 0 . 05 , from ﬁve diﬀerent cultures ) . Cortactin’s SH3 Domain Enhances the Formation of Actin Filaments in Permeabilized ACCs We have previously demonstrated that actin polymerization in ACCs is induced by Ca 2 + concentrations that trigger exocytosis ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we next determined whether cortactin is involved in this process . Cortactin can induce actin polymerization through its N - terminal region , which contains Arp2 / 3 and F - actin binding domains ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ) . However , this actin - binding protein can also promote the formation of actin ﬁlaments by interacting , via its SH3 domain , with PRD - containing proteins such as N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Kowalski et al . , 2005 ; Grassart et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , using diﬀerent regions of cortactin , we explored the implication of these two mechanisms on the cortical F - actin formation induced by Ca 2 + in ACCs . These experiments were performed in cells permeabilized with 20 µ M digitonin , in the presence of 300 nM Alexa - Fluor - 488 actin , 2 mM ATP - Mg 2 + and 10 µ M free Ca 2 + . In this condition , a ring of cortical F - actin is formed beneath the plasma membrane ( González - Jamett et al . , 2013 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . We ﬁrst evaluated the eﬀects of the N - terminal region and SH3 domain of cortactin ( see the schematic representation of cortactin domains in Figure 2A ) . Both recombinant peptides were fused to GST . Therefore , their eﬀects were compared with those of GST alone . The SH3 domain was additionally compared with the SH3W525K GST - fusion peptide ; this is a mutated version of the cortactin SH3 domain , which possesses reduced ability to bind PRDs ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . The SH3W525K peptide did not aﬀect actin polymerization , as compared with cells in the absence of peptides ( control ) or GST alone ( Figures 2B , C ) . Cortactin N - terminal also did not have any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the formation of cortical F - actin , suggesting that this cortactin region is not critical for F - actin remodeling in ACCs . However , the cortactin SH3 - GST - fusion peptide signiﬁcantly increased the formation of new actin ﬁlaments , as compared with cells in the absence of peptides ( control ) , or with cells treated with GST or SH3W525K GST - fusion peptide ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Given that the cortactin SH3 domain by itself can bind and activate N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Kowalski et al . , 2005 ) , we then explored whether the disruption of the association of N - WASP with SH3 domain - containing proteins aﬀects the Ca 2 + - induced formation of actin ﬁlaments . Thus , the actin polymerization assay was performed in cells incubated with the N - WASP PRD fused to GST , or with a Myc - tagged peptide of N - WASP WGP ( see the schematic representation of N - WASP and these regions in Figure 2A ) . WGP contains the N - WASP PRD but lacks the active VCA region , which contains the motifs that bind actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and promote actin polymerization ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2000 ) . As shown in Figures 2B , C , both N - WASP regions signiﬁcantly decreased the formation of new cortical actin ﬁlaments , suggesting that the interaction of the N - WASP PRD with SH3 domain - containing partners , such as cortactin , regulates F - actin remodeling in ACCs . To address this idea we also evaluated the eﬀect of a co - incubation with equimolar amounts of the cortactin SH3 GST - fusion peptide and Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 May 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 130 fncel - 11 - 00130 May 2 , 2017 Time : 15 : 17 # 5 González - Jamett et al . Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis FIGURE 1 | Cortactin migrates from the cytosol to the cell cortex in response to stimuli that induce exocytosis . ( A ) Bovine chromafﬁn cells under resting condition or stimulated with the nicotinic agonist DMPP ( 50 µ M ) were immunolabeled with an anti - cortactin monoclonal antibody ( green ) . Nuclei were stained with DAPI ( blue ) . The relative labeling of cortactin in the cell cortex was quantiﬁed by dividing the cortical ﬂuorescence intensity ( 1 µ m under the cell periphery ) by the total cell ﬂuorescence intensity . Note that cell stimulation with DMPP signiﬁcantly increased the cortical localization of cortactin as compared to the resting condition . ∗ p < 0 . 05 ( one - way ANOVA followed by unpaired t - test ) .

Nuclei were stained with DAPI ( blue ) . Then sample were visualized by confocal microscopy . Cortactin / F - actin colocalization was determined by Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient reaching a value of 0 . 61 ± 0 . 05 from ﬁve different cultures . Scale bar = 10 µ m . the N - WASP WGP . In this condition , the de novo formation of actin ﬁlaments was not aﬀected ( Figures 2B , C ) , suggesting that cortactin / N - WASP association via SH3 / PRD interaction plays a key role in the Ca 2 + - induced formation of actin ﬁlaments in ACCs . Cortactin Regulates Fusion Pore Lifetime through its Association to PRD - Containing Proteins Given that the SH3 domain of cortactin promotes actin polymerization , whereas the N - WASP PRD inhibits the formation of new actin ﬁlaments ( Figures 2B , C ) , we subsequently investigated the impact of these actions on exocytosis . Exocytotic events were induced with 50 µ M of the nicotinic agonist DMPP and monitored in real time using amperometry . We quantiﬁed the number of amperometric spikes and analyzed the spike charge ( Q ) that is proportional to the amount of catecholamines released per individual event , and the half - width ( t 1 / 2 ) that is proportional to the duration of the exocytotic event ( Mosharov and Sulzer , 2005 ) . We also examined the behavior of the early fusion pore , which is observed as a small current that precedes the amperometric spike . We analyzed the duration and amplitude of the foot signal . The duration of the foot signal correlates with the life - time of the initial fusion pore before its enlargement , whereas the foot amplitude is proportional to the ﬂux of catecholamines through the early fusion pore ( Fernández - Peruchena et al . , 2005 ) . The percentage of spikes with a foot signal was also quantiﬁed . In order to determine the eﬀects of cortactin SH3 domain and N - WASP PRD on exocytosis , ACCs were injected with 5 µ M of each GST - fusion peptide . This is a well - suited strategy to determine the acute eﬀects of peptides that interfere with protein functions or associations ( González - Jamett et al . , 2010 ) . The eﬀects of the injection of cortactin SH3 domain and N - WASP PRD were compared with the eﬀect of the injection of GST alone .

Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis the injection buﬀer containing 4 % Lucifer yellow , GST alone did not modify the diﬀerent amperometric parameters ( see Supplementary Table S1 ) . Cortactin SH3 eﬀects were additionally compared with the injection of the mutant peptide SH3W525K . Examples of 100 s amperometric recordings induced with 50 µ M DMPP in chromaﬃn cells injected with GST alone , cortactin SH3 or N - WASP PRD GST - fusion peptides are shown in Figure 3A . Cumulative histograms of the number of events during the entire recording are shown in Figure 3B . As compared with the injection of GST alone , both the SH3W525K and the cortactin SH3 GST - fusion peptide signiﬁcantly reduced the number of amperometric spikes between 20 and 80 s ( p < 0 . 05 ) . However , there were not signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the SH3W525K mutant and cortactin SH3 . The N - WASP PRD GST - fusion peptides did not produce any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the number of spikes ( Figure 3B ) . Figure 3C shows a scheme of an amperometric spike with the analyzed parameters . Examples of amperometric spikes from cells injected with GST alone , SH3W525K mutant , cortactin SH3 or N - WASP PRD GST - fusion peptides are shown in Figure 3D . The eﬀects of the GST - fusion peptides on the amperometric parameters Q , t 1 / 2 , foot duration , foot amplitude and percentage of foot signals are show in Figure 3E ( values are shown in Supplementary Table S1 ) . The injection of the SH3W525K GST - fusion peptide did not aﬀect the amperometric parameters , with the exception of the foot duration that was reduced when compared to GST - injected cells ( p < 0 . 05 ) . On the other hand , the injection of the cortactin SH3 GST - fusion peptide did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence Q , foot amplitude and the percentage of spikes with foot , but it signiﬁcantly decreased t 1 / 2 and foot duration , as compared to either GST alone or the SH3W525K GST - fusion peptide . The N - WASP PRD injection did not aﬀect Q , t 1 / 2 or the percentage of spikes with foot signals , but , as compared to GST alone , it signiﬁcantly increased foot duration and amplitude ( Figure 3E and Supplementary Table S1 ) . Hence , these results show that , likewise to that observed on the formation of new actin ﬁlaments , cortactin SH3 domain and N - WASP PRD have opposite eﬀects on the fusion pore duration . To further investigate the role of the association of cortactin with PRD - containing proteins , we used another strategy ; we expressed the EGFP - tagged FL - W525K . This point mutation severely disrupts the ability of cortactin to bind PRD - containing proteins and also interferes with the F - actin assembly , as shown in HeLa cells ( Cantarelli et al . , 2006 ; Nieto - Pelegrin and Martinez - Quiles , 2009 ) . The eﬀects of FL - W525K on exocytosis were FIGURE 3 | Effects of the cortactin SH3 domain and the N - WASP PRD on exocytosis .

Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis compared with the eﬀects of the expression of EGFP - tagged cortactin WT . Therefore , we ﬁrst determined whether the expression of cortactin WT aﬀects the diﬀerent amperometric parameters as compared with the expression of the empty vector EGFP . As shown in Supplementary Table S2 , cortactin WT did not modify any of the amperometric parameters as compared with the empty vector EGFP . Figure 4 shows the consequence of the expression of FL - W525K on the number of exocytotic events , spike charge ( Q ) , half - width ( t 1 / 2 ) , foot duration and foot amplitude . As compared with cortactin WT the expression of FL - W525K in ACCs signiﬁcantly diminished the number of exocytotic events during the last 40 s of the recording ( Figure 4A ) . Furthermore , FL - W525K also signiﬁcantly increased foot duration and amplitude , with no eﬀects on Q , t 1 / 2 and the percentage of spikes with foot . The average values are shown in Supplementary Table S3 . These results support the importance of the association of cortactin with PRD - containing proteins in exocytosis . Effects of the Cortactin SH3 Domain on Actin Polymerization and Exocytosis in the Presence of Latrunculin A In order to analyze whether the actions of the cortactin SH3 domain on exocytosis depend on actin polymerization , we next further evaluated the eﬀects of the injection of this peptide in the presence of Latrunculin A ( LatA ) . This toxin sequesters monomeric actin and disrupts actin polymerization ( Coué et al . , 1987 ) . Then , if the eﬀect of cortactin SH3 domain on exocytosis depends on actin polymerization , this peptide would not aﬀect exocytosis in the presence of an agent that sequesters monomeric actin . Figures 5A , B show the eﬀects of LatA on the Ca 2 + - dependent actin ﬁlament formation ; note that , as expected , this agent robustly inhibited actin polymerization . Additionally no F - actin formation was observed in cells treated with both LatA and cortactin SH3 domain ( Figures 5A , B ) , indicating that the eﬀects FIGURE 4 | Effects of the expression of the FL - W525K cortactin mutant on exocytosis in chromafﬁn cells .

Figure 5C compares the cumulative histograms of the number of amperometric events induced by DMPP in cells treated with the vehicle DMSO or LatA in non - injected cells , or LatA in cells injected with the cortactin SH3 domain . As compared with DMSO , LatA did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the number of exocytotic events . However , in cells injected with the cortactin SH3 domain and treated with LatA , the number of spikes was signiﬁcantly reduced ( Figure 4C ) , indicating that the eﬀects of the cortactin SH3 domain on the number of spikes does not depend on the availability of monomeric actin . Regarding the eﬀects of LatA on the amperometric parameters , as compared with the vehicle DMSO , this G - actin sequestering agent reduced Q and prolonged foot duration , but it did not aﬀect t 1 / 2 , foot amplitude and the percentage of foot signals ( Figure 5D and Supplementary Table S4 ) . LatA induced the same eﬀects in cells concomitantly injected with the cortactin SH3 domain ; that is , it reduced Q and prolonged foot duration , without aﬀecting t 1 / 2 , foot amplitude and the percentage of foot signals . However , the duration of the foot signal was signiﬁcantly longer in cells injected with the cortactin SH3 domain and treated with LatA , as compared with cells only treated with LatA ( Figure 5D and Supplementary Table S4 ) . These results suggest that the actions of the cortactin SH3 domain on the kinetics of single exocytotic events depend on de novo actin polymerization . However , this cortactin region appears to regulate the number of exocytotic events through a mechanism that does not involve actin polymerization . Serine and Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cortactin Deﬁne Its Action on Exocytosis Cortactin is a substrate of Ca 2 + - activated kinases such as ERK1 / 2 and Src . ERK1 / 2 , in its active state ( pERK1 / 2 ) , phosphorylates cortactin at the serine residues S405 and S418 ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) , while Src phosphorylates cortactin at the tyrosine residues Y421 , Y466 and Y482 ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Both types of phosphorylation regulate cortactin association to PRD - containing proteins ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Kelley et al . , 2011 ) as well as its activity following membrane stimulation ( Cao et al . , 2010 ; Mezi et al . , 2012 ; Rosales et al . , 2012 ; Vistein and Puthenveedu , 2014 ) . Therefore , we evaluated the eﬀect of the expression of the non - phosphorylatable mutants S405 , 418A ( 2A ) and Y421 , 466 , 482F ( 3F ) on exocytosis in ACCs . Localization of these mutations along the protein is schematized in Figure 6A . The eﬀects of the expression of these cortactin mutants on exocytosis were compared with the expression of cortactin WT . Cumulative histograms of the number of spikes throughout the entire recording period are shown in Figure 6B . The expression of the cortactin 3F mutant did not aﬀect the number of amperometric spikes .

Data are represented as means ± SEM . Numbers of cells for each condition are the same as indicated in ( B ) . ∗ p < 0 . 05 compared with WT ( one - way ANOVA followed by unpaired t - test ) . reduced the number of exocytotic events during the last 80 s , compared with the WT condition . Furthermore , both mutants , 2A and 3F , signiﬁcantly increased t 1 / 2 , foot duration and foot amplitude ( Figure 6C ) . Mean values of the amperometric parameters Q , t 1 / 2 , foot duration , foot amplitude and percentage of foot signals for each condition are shown in Supplementary Table S5 . Together these results indicate that the cortactin phosphorylation status inﬂuences the features of the exocytotic events in neuroendocrine chromaﬃn cells . Effects of the Inhibition of ERK1 / 2 Signaling on Exocytosis Given that the cortactin non - phosphorylatable mutant 2A ( Figure 6 ) signiﬁcantly impacts exocytosis aﬀecting the number of exocytotic events and the fusion pore properties , we analyzed whether the inhibition of the ERK1 / 2 signaling aﬀects similarly the exocytosis . To do so , we evaluated the eﬀect of U0126 , an inhibitor of the MEK . This is a threonine and tyrosine recognition kinase that phosphorylates and activates ERK1 / 2 ( Payne et al . , 1991 ) . Therefore , ACCs were incubated with 10 µ M of U0126 , or its inactive analog U0124 , 15 min prior to experimentation and throughout the test . In these conditions , U0126 eﬃciently inhibits ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ( Evans et al . , 2002 ; Mendoza et al . , 2003 ) . Table 1 shows the values of the diﬀerent amperometric parameters of ACCs treated with U0124 or U0126 . As compared with the inactive analog U0124 , the inhibitor of the ERK1 / 2 signaling U0126 reduced the number of exocytotic events , prolonged foot duration and decreased foot amplitude . Q and t 1 / 2 were not aﬀected . Then , these results indicate that the ERK1 / 2 signaling also prominently regulates exocytosis . DISCUSSION The cortical actin network is dynamically reorganized in stimulated neurosecretory cells to allow the secretory process to proceed ( Meunier and Gutiérrez , 2016 ) . In this regard , the cortical actin ﬁlaments reportedly form polygonal cavities that trap secretory vesicles in the cell cortex and direct them to docking sites ( Giner et al . , 2005 ; Papadopulos et al . , 2013 , 2015 ) , organize active exocytotic sites ( Torregrosa - Hetland et al . , 2011 ; Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 10 May 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 130 fncel - 11 - 00130 May 2 , 2017 Time : 15 : 17 # 11 González - Jamett et al .

Gabel et al . , 2015 ) and regulate the later stages of the fusion process ( Berberian et al . , 2009 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ; Wen et al . , 2016 ) . All these functions depend on the inherent plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton and an armamentarium of molecules that control F - actin rearrangement . One of those molecules is cortactin , an actin NPF that binds F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ) , as well as other NPFs such as N - WASP and WAVE2 ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Han et al . , 2014 ) , the actin - depolymerizing factor coﬁlin ( Oser et al . , 2009 ) and the GTPase dynamin - 2 , which is involved in actin ﬁlament remodeling ( Mooren et al . , 2009 ) , among others . In this regard , cortactin can regulate F - actin’s dynamics by using diﬀerent mechanisms , whose activation varies depending on the cellular process being executed ( Kelley et al . , 2011 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2011 ; Helgeson et al . , 2014 ) . By analyzing the formation of new actin ﬁlaments in permeabilized chromaﬃn cells and monitoring single exocytotic events with amperometry , we demonstrate here that in ACCs cortactin contributes to the Ca 2 + - dependent formation of new actin ﬁlaments and controls the later stages of exocytosis by a mechanism that depends on its association to PRD - containing proteins and its phosphorylation on serine and tyrosine residues by Ca 2 + - dependent kinases . Cortactin Translocates to the Cell Cortex upon Activation of Nicotinic Receptors As shown Figure 1 cortactin partially translocates to the cell cortex upon cell stimulation in ACCs , where it colocalizes with actin ﬁlaments . Cortactin translocation has been observed in diﬀerent types of cells ( Weed et al . , 1998 ; Cantarelli et al . , 2000 ; Tilghman and Hoover , 2002 ) , and reportedly depends on the activation of the Rho GTPase Rac ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) . This Rho GTPase is activated by cytosolic Ca 2 + increments ( Price et al . , 2003 ) and involved in Ca 2 + - dependent exocytosis in PC12 cells ( Komuro et al . , 1996 ; Momboisse et al . , 2009 ) . More recently , it has been observed that activation of the protein kinase C promotes cortactin translocation to the cell cortex in a way dependent on the Kelch - like ECH - associated protein 1 ( Keap1 ) , a protein involved in the response to oxidative stress ( Ito et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , cortactin translocation is required for the initiation of F - actin - dependent processes in diﬀerent cell types ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ) . Cortactin Controls the Formation of New Actin Filaments via Its SH3 Domain Cortactin controls actin polymerization in diﬀerent cellular systems by acting via a mechanism mediated by its N - terminal region , or alternatively through its SH3 domain ( Lua and Low , 2005 ) . The N - terminal region of cortactin directly binds to F - actin and activates the nucleation complex Arp2 / 3 ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ) , although , as compared with N - WASP , cortactin is a weak NPF ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , cortactin can act by enhancing N - WASP activity via a SH3 / PRD interaction ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . Our data suggest that in ACCs cortactin regulates Ca 2 + - dependent actin polymerization mainly through the second mechanism , wherein cortactin appears to enhance N - WASP activity in a manner dependent on their SH3 / PRD association . This idea is supported by the following facts : ( 1 ) the cortactin’s SH3 domain enhances the formation of actin ﬁlaments , ( 2 ) both the N - WASP PRD and WGP , an N - WASP region harboring the PRD , reduced the cortical F - actin formation and ( 3 ) equimolar amounts of WGP and the cortactin SH3 domain did not aﬀect actin polymerization ( Figure 2 ) . Nevertheless , we cannot rule out that cortactin could also control actin dynamics by using other mechanisms . In this regard , cortactin could increase , via a SH3 / PRD interaction , the intrinsic GTPase activity of dynamin - 2 ( Mooren et al . , 2009 ) , a protein that regulates F - actin dynamics in diﬀerent types of cells , including ACCs ( González - Jamett et al . , 2014 ) . Cortactin also associates via a SH3 / PRD interaction to WAVE2 ( Han et al . , 2014 ) , a ubiquitous member of the WAVE that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to induce actin polymerization ( Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , all these proteins can work cooperatively in cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling processes , as has been described for the cortactin - N - WASP - dynamin complex ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . Cortactin Regulates Fusion Pore Properties via its SH3 Domain Recent ﬁndings have highlighted the role of actin ﬁlaments on the later stages of exocytosis . In this regard , Wu and collaborators recently proposed that F - actin favors the membrane tension required to pull the (cid:127) shape membrane proﬁle formed by the vesicle during exocytosis ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . Given that both the cortactin SH3 domain and N - WASP PRD inﬂuence the Ca 2 + - induced actin polymerization in ACCs , we determined the impact of these protein domains on exocytosis . As shown in Figure 3 , the injection of the cortactin SH3 domain reduced t 1 / 2 and foot duration , indicating that this cortactin domain , which reportedly activates N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Kowalski et al . , 2005 ) , speeds up the fusion process . Conversely , the N - WASP PRD lengthened the duration of the foot signal , and increased its amplitude . The expression of the FL - W525K , which reportedly disrupts the ability of cortactin to bind PRD - containing proteins ( Cantarelli et al . , 2006 ; Nieto - Pelegrin and Martinez - Quiles , 2009 ) , also increased both duration and amplitude of the foot signals ( Figure 4 ) . Then , these data suggest that the association of cortactin with PRD - containing partners regulates the kinetics , as well Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 11 May 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 130 fncel - 11 - 00130 May 2 , 2017 Time : 15 : 17 # 12 González - Jamett et al . Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis as the conductance of the initial fusion pore . The ﬂux of catecholamines through the initial fusion pore depends on structural features , such as pore diameter and length ( Fang et al . , 2008 ) . However , vesicle size and intravesicular free catecholamine concentrations could also aﬀect the characteristics of the amperometric foot ( Sombers et al . , 2004 ; Amatore et al . , 2005 ) . Since amperometry does not directly measure the fusion pore conductance , other types of techniques such as cell - attached capacitance measurements could provide us with additional information about the mechanism by which cortactin regulates the initial pore features . Cortactin Regulates the Number of Exocytotic Events The amount of exocytotic events in neuroendocrine cells depends on the size of releasable pool of vesicles , as well as on vesicle transport , docking , priming , and fusion ( Becherer and Rettig , 2006 ) . As shown in Figure 4A , the expression of the FL - W525K , as compared with cortactin WT reduced the number of amperometric spikes . Since this eﬀect is also observed with the cortactin SH3 domain , we could infer that both this peptide and the mutation in the full - length protein interrupt the association of endogenous cortactin with a partner that regulates the amount of exocytosis . However , the mutant peptide SH3W525K also signiﬁcantly reduced the number of amperometric spikes ( Figure 3B ) . A possible explanation for these ﬁndings is that the W525K mutation in the full - length cortactin eﬀectively disrupts the association of cortactin to a given PRD - containing domain partner , but this mutation in the GST - peptide is less eﬀective in disrupting that interaction . These diﬀerences could be a consequence of phosphorylation or other types of post - transcriptional modiﬁcations in the full - length protein that modify its association to a given PRD - containing partner . For instance , cortactin phosphorylation by pERK1 / 2 enhances its association to N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) , whereas its phosphorylation by Src kinase appears to favor its interaction with dynamin - 2 ( Cao et al . , 2010 ) . Another explanation is that the cortactin SH3 domain could display non - conventional interactions , as observed with other SH3 domains ( Jia et al . , 2005 ; Sriram and Birge , 2012 ) . For instance , cortactin interacts with the myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) , in a cortactin SH3 domain dependent manner ( Dudek et al . , 2002 , 2004 ) ; however , the substitution of proline residues by alanines in the full length MLCK does not alter its association to cortactin ( Belvitch et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , inhibition of MLCK in ACCs hinders Ca 2 + - induced catecholamine release and ATP - dependent vesicle priming and vesicle transport ( Kumakura et al . , 1994 ; Neco et al . , 2002 ) . Then , MLCK could be a cortactin partner that regulates the amount of exocytosis . Nevertheless , it is important to keep in mind that SH3 domains can exhibit high versatility and promiscuity ( Agrawal and Kishan , 2002 ; Li , 2005 ) , and that the association to PRD - containing partners is regulated by post - transcriptional modiﬁcations ( Lua and Low , 2005 ; Sriram and Birge , 2012 ) . These properties allow them to be involved in diﬀerent types of cellular processes . Do the Actions of the Cortactin SH3 Domain on Exocytosis Depend on Actin Polymerization ? Although the eﬀects of the cortactin SH3 domain and N - WASP PRD on the Ca 2 + - induced actin polymerization correlates well with the eﬀects of these peptides on fusion pore dynamics , we cannot rule out that cortactin regulates exocytosis through a mechanism independent of F - actin remodeling . Therefore , to better understand this mechanism , we analyzed the eﬀects of the SH3 domain of cortactin in the presence of LatA , a toxin that sequesters monomeric actin and inhibits actin polymerization . As previously observed by other authors ( Berberian et al . , 2009 ) , LatA increased the fusion pore duration ( Figure 5D ) . This toxin also decreased quantal size ( Figure 5D ) , probably as a consequence of an incomplete fusion . In fact , LatA reduces the membrane tension required for vesicle merging into the plasma membrane in ACCs ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) . In the presence of LatA , the cortactin SH3 domain was unable to promote actin polymerization ( Figure 5A ) , and the eﬀects of LatA on the kinetics of exocytosis predominate over the eﬀects of the cortactin SH3 domain . Indeed , cortactin did not reduce t 1 / 2 and foot duration ( Figure 5D ) , as observed in cells injected with this peptide but not treated with LatA ( Figure 3E ) . Furthermore , foot durations were longer in cells injected with cortactin SH3 domain and then treated with LatA , as compared with non - injected cells treated LatA . A possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that LatA might unmask actions of the cortactin SH3 domain , such as its association to partners that regulate fusion pore dilation in a way independent of actin polymerization . That could be the case of MLCK , whose substrate myosin light chain regulates fusion pore expansion in ACCs ( Neco et al . , 2008 ) . On the other hand , the cortactin SH3 domain was still able of reducing the number of exocytotic events in the presence of LatA ( Figure 5C ) , suggesting that this cortactin action occurs by a mechanism independent of actin polymerization . As we discussed above , MLCK could be a cortactin partner that regulates the amount of exocytosis . Serine and Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cortactin Regulates Fusion Pore Lifetime As aforementioned cortactin phosphorylation at the serine residues 405 and 418 and at the tyrosine residues 421 , 466 and 482 , by pERK1 / 2 and Src tyrosine kinases respectively , regulates cortactin activity and its association with partners ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Tehrani et al . , 2007 ; Kelley et al . , 2011 ) . Whereas cortactin phosphorylation by pERK1 / 2 directly promotes N - WASP activation via a SH3 / PRD interaction ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) , phosphorylation of cortactin by Src activates N - WASP through recruitment of the adaptor protein Nck1 , by a mechanism that does not involve the SH3 domain of cortactin ( Tehrani et al . , 2007 ; Oser et al . , 2009 ) . In this latter mechanism , N - WASP is activated by the SH3 domains of Nck ( Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ; Ditlev et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , we expected that the ERK1 / 2 non - phosphorylatable mutant , but not necessarily the Src non - phosphorylatable mutant , displays eﬀects comparable to those produced by the disruption of Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 12 May 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 130 fncel - 11 - 00130 May 2 , 2017 Time : 15 : 17 # 13 González - Jamett et al . Cortactin in Actin Dynamics and Exocytosis cortactin / N - WASP association . Eﬀectively , the 2A mutant prolonged the duration of the initial fusion pore and increased the amplitude of the foot signal , similarly to that observed with the injection of the N - WASP PRD or with the expression of the FL - W525K . Interestingly , the same eﬀects also were observed in cells expressing the 3F mutant , indicating that this type of cortactin phosphorylation can also regulate fusion pore dynamics . Given that cortactin can be simultaneously phosphorylated by both pERK1 / 2 and tyrosine kinases ( Kelley et al . , 2011 ) , it is probable that both types of phosphorylation contribute together to regulate fusion pore expansion in ACCs . On the other hand , and contrary to that observed with the SH3 domain of cortactin , both non - phosphorylatable mutants 2A and 3F signiﬁcantly increased t 1 / 2 , suggesting that cortactin is involved in the regulation of the duration of the release events . The eﬀects of the cortactin non - phosphorylatable mutant 3F on t 1 / 2 and foot duration correlate well with the eﬀects of the pharmacological inhibition of Src kinases on those parameters ( Olivares et al . , 2014 ) . On the other hand , both the expression of the non - phosphorylatable mutant 2A and the ERK1 / 2 signaling inhibitor U0126 prolonged foot duration . However , they have opposite eﬀects on foot amplitude ; whereas the 2A mutant prolongs foot amplitude , U0126 decreases it ( Figure 5C and Table 1 ) . pERK1 / 2 also phosphorylates the MLCK ( Klemke et al . , 1997 ) , and inhibition of ERK1 / 2 signaling decreases the function of MLCK , as well as the phosphorylation of its substrate myosin light chain ( Klemke et al . , 1997 ) . Expression of a non - phosphorylatable mutant of myosin II regulatory light chain in ACCs hinders the fusion pore expansion , limiting the release of catecholamines through the initial fusion pore ( Neco et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , the eﬀects of U0126 on fusion pore conductance could be a consequence of an inhibition of MLCK . Both the expression of the phosphorylatable mutant 2A and the cell treatment with the ERK1 / 2 signaling inhibitor U0126 reduced the number of exocytotic events , suggesting that cortactin phosphorylation by pERK1 / 2 inﬂuences the amount of exocytosis . As discussed above , MLCK is a cortactin partner involved in vesicle transport and priming ( Kumakura et al . , 1994 ; Neco et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , and as aforementioned , MLCK is also a substrate of ERK1 / 2 ( Klemke et al . , 1997 ) . Then these ﬁndings point out to ERK1 / 2 , MLCK and cortactin as regulators of the amount of exocytosis . CONCLUSION Together , the present ﬁndings point out a role of cortactin as a modulator of Ca 2 + regulated exocytosis . Cortactin actions on exocytosis depend on the interaction of its SH3 domain with PRD - containing partners , such as N - WASP and MLCK . Whereas the association of cortactin with N - WASP appears to be critical for the Ca 2 + - induced actin ﬁlament formation and fusion pore expansion , a diﬀerent mechanism seems to determine the role of cortactin in the extent of exocytosis . These cortactin actions are regulated by its phosphorylation at serine and tyrosine residues by ERK1 / 2 and Src kinases , respectively . These new mechanisms are clearly relevant for the tight regulation of transmitter release in neuroendocrine cells .
