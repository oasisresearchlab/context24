1 2 Figure S1 . Depletion of cPLA2 α induces hyper - tubulation of early endosomes . ( A - D ) HeLa cells growing on coverslips were mock - treated ( A and C ) or treated with cPLA2 α - siRNA ( B and D ) for 48 h . Cells were then fixed and stained with either mouse anti - Rab5 ( A - B ) or anti - EEA1 antibody ( C - D ) for 1 h , followed by Alexa 568 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody . Bottom panels are magnified insets . Bar , 10 μ m . 3 4 Figure S2 . Partial co - localization between MICAL - L1 , EHD1 and CD59 - endosomes . ( A ) HeLa cells growing on coverslips were co - transfected with Tomato - EHD1 and GFP - MICAL - L1 . After 16 h , cells were pulsed with mouse anti - CD59 antibody for 15 min at 37 o C , acid - stripped , fixed , and stained with Alexa 405 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody . Red boxed areas are shown in higher magnification . Bar , 10 μ m . ( B ) HeLa cells growing on coverslips were pre - treated with either 0 . 3 μ M Jasplakinolide or 0 . 3 μ M Cytochalasin D for 15 min at 37 o C . Cells were then pulsed with anti - CD59 antibody for 15 min in the presence of the corresponding agents , acid - stripped , fixed , and stained with 488 - phalloidin for 1 h , followed by Alexa 568 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody . Bar , 10 μ m . 5 Figure S3 . cPLA2 α over - expression is insufficient to promote vesiculation of either CD59 - containing - or MICAL - L1 - decorated endosomes . ( A - D ) HeLa cells growing on coverslips were transfected with HA - cPLA2 α for 16 h . ( A and B ) Cells were pulsed with anti - CD59 antibody for 15 min at 37 o C . After stripping , cells were fixed and stained with rabbit anti - HA antibody followed by Alexa 568 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody and Alexa 488 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody . ( C - D ) Cells were fixed and co - stained with mouse anti - MICAL - L1 and rabbit anti - HA antibodies , followed by Alexa 568 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody and Alexa 488 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody . Yellow lines in ( A and C ) denote the transfected cells . Bar , 10 μ M .
