Nunes Amaral , Antonio Scala , Marc Barth´el´emy , and H . Eugene Stanley Center for Polymer Studies and Department of Physics Boston University , MA 02215 , USA Small - world networks are the focus of recent interest because they appear to circumvent many of the limitations of either random networks or regular lattices as frameworks for the study of interaction networks of complex systems . Here , we report an empirical study of the statistical properties of a variety of diverse real - world networks . We present evidence of the occurrence of three classes of small - world networks : ( a ) scale - free networks , characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that decays as a power law ; ( b ) broad - scale networks , characterized by a connectivity distribution that has a power - law regime followed by a sharp cut - oﬀ ; ( c ) single - scale networks , characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail . Moreover , we note for the classes of broad - scale and single - scale networks that there are constraints limiting the addition of new links . Our results suggest that the nature of such constraints may be the controlling factor for the emergence of diﬀerent classes of networks . Disordered networks , such as small - world networks are the focus of recent interest because of their poten - tial as models for the interaction networks of complex systems [ 1 – 6 ] . Speciﬁcally , neither random networks nor regular lattices appear to be an adequate frame - work within which to study “real - world” complex sys - tems [ 7 ] such as chemical - reaction networks [ 8 ] , neuronal networks [ 1 ] , food - webs [ 9 – 11 ] , social networks [ 12 – 14 ] , scientiﬁc - collaboration networks [ 15 ] , and computer net - works [ 4 , 16 , 17 ] . Small - world networks [ 1 , 2 ] —which emerge as the re - sult of randomly replacing a fraction p of the links of a d - dimensional lattice with new random links— interpolate between the two limiting cases of a regular lattice ( p = 0 ) and a random graph ( p = 1 ) . A “small - world” network is characterized by the properties ( i ) the local neighbor - hood is preserved —as for regular lattices [ 1 , 2 ] — , and ( ii ) the diameter of the network , quantiﬁed by average short - est distance between two vertices [ 18 ] , increases logarith - mically with the number of vertices n —as for random graphs [ 19 ] . The latter property gives the name “small - world” to these networks , as it is possible to connect any two vertices in the network through just a few links while the local connectivity would suggest the network to be of ﬁnite dimensionality . The structure of small - world networks and of real net - works has been probed through the calculation of their diameter as a function of network size [ 1 ] . In particular , networks such as ( a ) the electric - power grid for Southern California , ( b ) the network of movie - actor collaborations , and ( c ) the neuronal network of the worm C . Elegans , appear to be small - world networks [ 1 ] . Further , it was proposed [ 5 ] that these three networks , the world - wide web [ 4 ] , and the network of citations of scientiﬁc papers [ 20 , 21 ] are scale - free —that is , they have a distribution of connectivities that decays with a power - law tail . Scale - free networks emerge in the context of a grow - ing network in which new vertices connect preferentially to the more highly connected vertices in the network [ 5 ] . Scale free networks are still small - world networks because ( i ) they have clustering coeﬃcients much larger than ran - dom networks [ 1 , 2 ] , and ( ii ) their diameter increases log - arithmically with the number of vertices n [ 5 ] . Here , we address the question of the conditions un - der which disordered networks are scale - free through the analysis of several networks in social , economic , techno - logic , biologic , and physical systems . We identify a num - ber of systems for which there is a single scale for the connectivity of the vertices . For all these networks there are constraints limiting the addition of new links . Our results suggest that such constraints may be the control - ling factor for the emergence of scale - free networks . First , we consider two examples of technologic and eco - nomic networks : ( i ) the electric - power grid of Southern California [ 1 ] , the vertices being generators , transformers and substations and the links high - voltage transmission lines , and ( ii ) the network of world airports [ 22 ] , the ver - tices being the airports and the links non - stop connec - tions . Figure 1 shows the connectivity distribution for these two examples . It is visually apparent that neither case has a power - law regime , and that both have expo - nentially decaying tails , implying that there is a single scale for the connectivity k . Second , we consider three examples of “social” net - works : ( iii ) the movie - actors network [ 1 ] , the links in this network indicating that the two actors were cast at least once in the same movie , ( iv ) the acquaintance network of Mormons [ 23 ] , the vertices being 43 Utah Mormons and the number of links the number of other Mormons they know , and ( v ) the friendship - network of 417 Madi - son Junior High School students [ 24 ] . Figure 2 shows the connectivity distribution for these social networks . The scale - free ( power - law ) behavior of the actor’s net - work [ 5 ] is truncated by an exponential tail . In contrast , the network of acquaintances of the Utah Mormons and the friendship network of the high - school students dis - 1 play no power - law regime , but instead we ﬁnd results consistent with a Gaussian distribution of connectivities , indicating the existence of a single scale for k . Third , we consider two examples of networks from the natural sciences : ( vi ) the neuronal network of the worm C . Elegans [ 1 , 25 , 26 ] , the vertices being the neurons and the links being connections between neurons , and ( vii ) the conformation space of a lattice polymer chain [ 27 ] , the vertices being the possible conformations of the poly - mer chain and the links the possibility of connecting two conformations through local movements of the chain [ 27 ] . The conformation space of a protein chain shares many of the properties [ 27 ] of the small - world networks of Ref . [ 1 ] . Figures 3a , b show for C . Elegans the cumulative distribu - tion of k for both incoming and outgoing neuronal links . The tails of both distributions are well approximated by exponential decays , consistent with a single scale for the connectivities . For the network of conformations of a polymer chain the connectivity follows a binomial dis - tribution , which converges to the Gaussian [ 27 ] , so we also ﬁnd a single scale for the connectivity of the ver - tices ( Fig . 3c ) . Thus , there is empirical evidence for the occurrence of three classes of small - world networks : ( a ) scale - free net - works , characterized by a connectivity distribution with a tail that decays as a power law [ 4 , 20 , 21 ] ; ( b ) broad - scale or truncated scale - free networks , characterized by a con - nectivity distribution that has a power - law regime fol - lowed by a sharp cut - oﬀ , like an exponential or Gaussian decay of the tail [ see example ( iii ) ] ; ( c ) single - scale net - works , characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail , such as exponential or Gaussian [ see examples ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iv - vii ) ] . A natural question is “What are the reasons for such a rich range of possible structures for small - world net - works ? ” To answer this question let us recall that pref - erential attachment in growing networks gives rise to a power - law distribution of connectivities [ 5 ] . However , preferential attachment can be hindered by two classes of factors : ( I ) aging of the vertices . This eﬀect can be pictured for the network of actors : in time , every actress or actor will stop acting . For the network , this fact im - plies that even a very highly connected vertex will , even - tually , stop receiving new links . The vertex is still part of the network and contributing to network statistics , but it no longer receives links . The aging of the vertices thus limits the preferential attachment preventing a scale - free distribution of connectivities . ( II ) cost of adding links to the vertices or the limited capacity of a vertex . This eﬀect is exempliﬁed by the network of world airports : for reasons of eﬃciency , commercial airlines prefer to have a small number of hubs where all routes would connect . To ﬁrst approximation , this is indeed what happens for individual airlines , but when we consider all airlines to - gether , it becomes physically impossible for an airport to become a hub to all airlines . Due to space and time constraints , each airport will limit the number of land - ings / departures per hour , and the number of passengers in transit . Hence , physical costs of adding links and lim - ited capacity of a vertex [ 28 , 29 ] will limit the number of possible links attaching to a given vertex . To test numerically the eﬀect of aging and cost con - straints on the local structure of networks with prefer - ential attachment , we simulate the scale - free model of Ref . [ 5 ] but introduce aging and cost constraints of vary - ing strength . Figure 4 shows that both types of con - straints lead to cut - oﬀs on the power - law decay of the tail of connectivity distribution and that for strong enough constraints no power - law region is visible . We note that the possible distributions of connectiv - ity of the small - world networks have an analogy in the theory of critical phenomena [ 30 ] . At the gas - liquid crit - ical point , the distribution of sizes of the droplets of the gas ( or of the liquid ) is scale - free , as there is no free - energy cost in their formation [ 30 ] . As for the case of a scale - free network , the size s of a droplet is power - law dis - tributed : p ( s ) ∼ s − α . As we move away from the critical point , the appearance of a non - negligible surface tension introduces a free - energy cost for droplets which limits their sizes , so that their distribution becomes broad - scale : p ( s ) ∼ s − α f ( s / ξ ) , where ξ is the typical size for which surface tension starts to be signiﬁcant and the function f ( s / ξ ) introduces a sharp cut - oﬀ for droplet sizes s > ξ . Far from the critical point , the scale ξ becomes so small that no power - law regime is observed and the droplets become single - scale distributed : p ( s ) ∼ f ( s / ξ ) . Often , the distribution of sizes in this regime is exponential or Gaussian . We thank J . S . Andrade Jr . , R . Cuerno , N . Dokholyan , P . Gopikrishnan , C . Hartley , E . LaNave , K . B .

Technologic and economic networks . a Linear - log plot of the cumulative distribution of connectivities for the electric - power grid of Southern California [ 1 ] . For this type of plot , the distribution falls on a straight line indicating an exponential decay of the distribution of connectivities .

If the distribution would have a power law tail then it would fall on a straight line in a log - log plot . Clearly , the data reject the hypothesis of power - law distribution for the connectivity . c Linear - log plot of the cumulative distribution of traﬃc at the world’s largest airports for two measures of traﬃc , cargo and number of passengers . The network of world airports is a small - world network : one can connect any two airports in the network by only 1 - 5 links . To study the distribution of connectivities of this network , we assume that , for a given airport , cargo and number of passengers are proportional to the number of connections of that airport with other airports . The data are consistent with a decay of the distribution of connectivities for the network of world airports that decays exponentially or faster . The full line is an exponential ﬁt to the cargo data for values of traﬃc between 500 and 1500 . For values of traﬃc larger than 1500 , the distribution appears to decay even faster than an exponential . The long - dashed line is an exponential to the passenger data for values of traﬃc between 500 and 1500 . d Log - log plot of the cumulative distribution of traﬃc at the world’s largest airports . This plot conﬁrms that the tails of the distributions decay faster than a power law would . 4 FIGURE 2 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 # of collaborations 10 −6 10 −5 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 C u m u l a ti v e d i s t r i bu ti on a Actors 1 10 100 1000 10000 # of collaborations 10 −6 10 −5 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 C u m u l a ti v e d i s t r i bu ti on b Actors 1 . 3 0 100 200 300 400 # of acquaintances 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 C u m u l a ti v e d i s t r i bu ti on c Mormons Gaussian 0 5 10 15 # of times chosen 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 C u m u l a ti v e d i s t r i bu ti on First 2 friends First 3 friends Gaussian Friendships d FIG . 2 .

The full line is a guide for the eye of what an exponential decay would be . The data appear to fall faster in the tail than for an exponential decay , suggesting a Gaussian decay . Both exponential and Gaussian decays indicate that the connectivity distribution is not scale free . b Log - log plot of the cumulative distribution of connectivities for the network of movie actors . This plot suggests that for values of number of collaborations between 30 and 300 the data are consistent with a power - law decay . The apparent exponent of this cumulative distribution , α − 1 ≈ 1 . 3 , is consistent with the value α = 2 . 3 ± 0 . 1 reported for the probability density function [ 5 ] . For larger numbers of collaborations the power - law decays is truncated . c Linear - log plot of the cumulative distribution of connectivities for the network of acquaintances of 43 Utah Mormons [ 23 ] . The full line is the ﬁt to the cumulative distribution of a Gaussian . The tail of the distribution appears to fall oﬀ as a Gaussian , suggesting that there is a single scale for the number of acquaintances in social networks . d Linear - log plot of the cumulative distribution of connectivities for the friendship network of 417 high - school students [ 24 ] .

A simple argument suggests that the connectivities follow a binomial distribution . The full and dashed lines are ﬁts of a binomial probability density function to the data for polymer chains of diﬀerent lengths . For the values of the parameters obtained in the ﬁt , the binomial closely resembles the Gaussian indicating that there is a single scale for the connectivities of the conformation space of polymers . 6 FIGURE 4 1 10 100 1000 10000 # of links 10 −6 10 −5 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 C u m u l a ti v e d i s t r i bu ti on No aging Slow aging Fast aging a 1 10 100 1000 10000 # of links 10 −6 10 −5 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 C u m u l a ti v e d i s t r i bu ti on No cost Low cost High cost b FIG . 4 .
