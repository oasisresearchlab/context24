Cbl is a multi - adaptor protein involved in ligand - induced down - regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases . It is thought that Cbl - mediated ubiquitination of active receptors is essential for receptor degradation and cessation of receptor - induced signal transduction 1 – 5 . Here we demonstrate that Cbl additionally regulates epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor endocytosis . Cbl rapidly recruits CIN85 ( Cbl - interacting protein of 85K ; ref . 6 ) and endophilins ( regulatory components of clathrin - coated vesicles 7 – 10 ) to form a complex with activated EGF receptors , thus controlling receptor internalization . CIN85 was constitu - tively associated with endophilins , whereas CIN85 binding to the distal carboxy terminus of Cbl was increased on EGF stimulation . Inhibition of these interactions was sufﬁcient to block EGF receptor internalization , delay receptor degradation and enhance EGF - induced gene transcription , without perturbing Cbl - directed receptor ubiquitination . Thus , the evolutionary diver - gent C terminus of Cbl uses a mechanism that is functionally separable from the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl to mediate ligand - dependent downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases . Recent genetic evidence has indicated that the C terminus of SLI - 1 , the Cbl orthologue in Caenorhabditis elegans , is necessary for negative regulation of LET - 23 - induced vulval development in nematode worms 11 . The C terminus of Cbl is divergent from SLI - 1 , and contains a larger proline - rich region and a distal C - terminal tail composed of an acidic box domain and a ubiquitin - associated ( UBA ) domain 1 . To identify proteins that bind speciﬁcally to the C terminus of Cbl , we screened for clones interacting with either the proline - rich sequences ( residues 480 – 680 ) or the distal part ( resi - dues 680 – 906 ) of Cbl in the yeast two - hybrid system . Among six double positive clones , one clone coding for CIN85 bound to the distal tail of Cbl ( Supplementary Information Fig . 1a ) . CIN85 , also known as Ruk 12 and SETA 13 , is an adapter protein containing three Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains , a proline - rich region and a coiled - coil domain 6 . The SH3 domains of CIN85 bound to the distal C terminus of Cbl but not to the proline - rich region of Cbl in pull - down assays ( Supplementary Information Fig . 1b , c ) , and in co - precipitation studies in mammalian cells ( Fig . 1a ) . We also observed increased complex formation between CIN85 and Cbl in EGF - stimulated HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells ( Fig . 1b ) , as well as in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293T cells transfected with Cbl and CIN85 constructs ( Supplementary Information Fig . 1d ) . CIN85 binding to Cbl was largely attenuated in a phos - phorylation - defective Cbl mutant ( Y700 / 731 / 774F ) ( data not shown and ref . 6 ) . Similarly , Cbl association with CMS , a homol - ogue of CIN85 , is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl 14 . Therefore , EGF - induced phosphorylation of Cbl may cause a conformational change in its distal C terminus , thus exposing polyproline motifs that serve as binding sites for the SH3 domains of CIN85 or CMS . Notably , a ligand - inducible complex between EGF receptor and CIN85 was detected in cells expressing Cbl or oncogenic Cbl with impaired RING - ﬁnger domain ( Cbl - 70Z ) , but not Cbl deleted for CIN85 binding sites ( Cbl - 655 ) ( Fig . 1c ) . These data indicate that increased Cbl phosphorylation and binding to EGF receptors , but not its ubiquitin ligase activity , contribute to the recruitment of CIN85 in EGF receptor complexes . CIN85 was also shown to associate with several adaptor pro - teins 12 , 15 , 16 , and could thereby facilitate the assembly of a larger Cbl - associated network on growth - factor stimulation . To identify additional CIN85 - associated proteins , we screened for clones able to interact with the C terminus of CIN85 in the yeast two - hybrid system . Seven double positive clones were identiﬁed as endophilin A1 , A2 or A3 , each containing the intact SH3 domain ( not shown ) , suggesting that the SH3 domain of endophilins binds to CIN85 . These results were conﬁrmed in vitro by the ability of the SH3 domain of endophilin A1 to bind to the isolated proline - rich a c b IP : anti - CIN85 Blot : anti - CIN85 anti - Cbl – + – + HeLa CHOEGFR – + Blot : anti - EGFR EGFRCbl - 70Z CIN85 anti - Flag – + EGFRCblCIN85 IP : anti - EGFR 150K 75K EGFRCIN85 EGFRCbl - 655 CIN85 – + – + d SH2 RF PXXP DCT Cbl Cbl - 70Z Cbl - 655 SH3 SH3 SH3 CIN85 CIN85 - PCC PXXP CIN85 - 3SH3 CC TCL IP : anti - HA IP : anti - Flag C I N 85 + C b l C I N 85 + C b l - 655 C I N 85 + C b l C I N 85 + C b l - 655 C I N 85 + C b l C I N 85 + C b l - 655 100K 75K M r HA - Cbl Flag - CIN85 HA - Cbl - 655 M r 100K 75K M r Figure 1 CIN85 is recruited to Cbl – EGF receptor complexes on EGF stimulation . a , Lysates ( TCL ) of HEK 293T cells expressing indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with anti - HA or anti - Flag antibodies , and immunoblotted with a mixture of anti - HA / Flag antibodies .

In addition , endogenous or overexpressed Cbl co - precipi - tated with endophilin A1 only in the presence of CIN85 , indicating that CIN85 acts as a linker between Cbl and endophilins ( Fig . 2a ) . CIN85 was constitutively bound to endophilin A1 ( Fig . 2b ) , whereas its binding to Cbl was increased in EGF - stimulated cells ( Figs 1b and 2b ) , thereby leading to EGF - induced co - precipitation between Cbl and endophilin A1 ( Fig . 2b ) and EGF receptors and endophilin A1 ( Fig . 2c ) . Importantly , we were able to demonstrate a ligand - inducible association of endogenous CIN85 and endophilins with the Cbl – EGFR complex in HeLa and MDA cells ( Fig . 2d ) . CIN85 and endophilins co - precipitated with — in addition to phosphory - lated EGF receptors and Cbl — several unidentiﬁed tyrosine phos - phorylated proteins from EGF - treated cells ( Fig . 2d ) . Taken together our data indicate that CIN85 constitutively associates with endophilins , whereas its potency to bind to Cbl is increased on EGF stimulation . In this way , CIN85 recruits endophilins in the complex with activated EGF receptors . Endophilins were previously implicated in the control of cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis 7 – 10 . They bind to the regulatory com - ponents of endocytic vesicles 17 , 18 and modulate plasma membrane invagination by intrinsic acyl - transferase activity 7 and by direct binding to lipid bilayers 19 . Both CIN85 and endophilins were found diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of resting CHO cells , whereas they co - localized with EGF receptors in endocytic vesicles after EGF stimulation ( Supplementary Information Fig . 3a , b ) . We next tested the importance of a Cbl – CIN85 – endophilin complex for EGF receptor ubiquitination and endocytosis . Dominant interfering forms of CIN85 containing either isolated SH3 domains ( CIN85 - 3SH3 ) that associate with Cbl ( Supplementary Information Fig . 1c ) or a proline - rich region with a coiled - coil domain ( CIN85 - PCC ) that binds to endophilin A1 ( Supplementary Information Fig . 2a , b ) , were analysed for their ability to modulate EGF receptor polyubiquitination and subsequent receptor degradation . Cbl - mediated polyubiquitination of the EGF receptor was intact in the presence of dominant interfering forms of CIN85 ( Fig . 3a ) . In contrast , the expression of CIN85 - 3SH3 or CIN85 - PCC , but not CIN85 , delayed Cbl - mediated EGF receptor degradation ( Fig . 3b ) . These data suggest that CIN85 is dispensable for polyubiquitination of EGF receptors , whereas it may be critical for the regulation of receptor endocytosis and lysosomal degradation . Furthermore , these results indicate that polyubiquitinated EGF receptors can be uncoupled from a degradative fate if parallel Cbl / CIN85 - mediated events are perturbed . We investigated further the impact of expression of dominant interfering mutants of CIN85 on EGF receptor endocytosis and downregulation . Expression of Cbl together with EGF receptors led to a signiﬁcant increase in the rate of ligand internalization and the a anti - Flag Flag - CIN85 CbI HA - EndA1 TCL anti - Cbl Blot : anti - HA C I N 85 + E n d A 1 C b l + E n d A 1 C b l + C I N 85 + E n d A 1 C I N 85 + E n d A 1 C b l + E n d A 1 C b l + C I N 85 + E n d A 1 IP : anti - Cbl b IP : anti - EGFR anti - EGFR Blot : anti - HA – + – + EndA1 CIN85EndA1 anti - Flag anti - HA HA - EndA1 TCL HA - EndA1 Flag - CIN85 EGFR c d IP : anti - EGFR Blot : – + – + – + MDA cells anti - CIN85 anti - endophilin anti - endophilin pre - imm . anti - CIN85 anti - Cbl 250K 150K 100K 75K 37K IP : anti - Flag IP : anti - Cbl anti - Cbl anti - Flag Blot : anti - HA anti - Cbl anti - HA – + – + Flag - CIN85 Cbl HA - EndA1 Cbl HA - EndA1 F l a g - C I N 85 H A - E n d A 1 C b l + F l a g - C I N 85 H A - E n d A 1 IP : anti - endophilin anti - CIN85 anti - CIN85 anti - EGFR Blot : anti - CIN85 anti - endophilin anti - Cbl Blot : anti - PTyr – + – + – + – + HeLa cells anti - endophilin 250K 150K 100K 75K 50K 37K M r CbI EGFR M r Figure 2 CIN85 links endophilins with the Cbl – EGFR complex . a , Lysates ( TCL ) of HEK 293T cells expressing designated proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) and immunoblotting with indicated antibodies .

However , Cbl - accelerated receptor internalization and downregula - tion was efﬁciently blocked by expression of CIN85 - 3SH3 and CIN85 - PCC ( Fig . 3c , d ) , but not by expression of CIN85 ( Fig . 3c ) , single SH3 domains of CIN85 or polyproline motifs that do not bind to endophilins ( Supplementary Information Fig . 4 ) . The principal function of CIN85 was further demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of CIN85 - 3SH3 or CIN85 - PCC on the endogenous machinery involved in EGF receptor internalization and down - regulation in CHO cells ( Fig . 3c , d ) . These inhibitory effects of CIN85 - 3SH3 and CIN85 - PCC were also visualized by immuno - ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 3e ) , quantiﬁed and expressed as a percentage of CHO cells internalizing EGF receptors ( Supplementary Infor - mation Fig . 3c ) . It was recently demonstrated that Cbl binds and ubiquitinates EGF receptors at the plasma membrane , and remains associated with EGF receptors along the endocytic pathway where it may participate in sorting internalized receptors for lysosomal degradation 20 , 21 . Our results indicate that Cbl , by recruiting CIN85 and endophilins in complex with EGF receptors , also has an important function in the regulation of receptor internalization . Finally , we tested whether dominant interfering forms of CIN85 can attenuate the inhibitory effect of Cbl on EGF receptor signalling pathways , by measuring EGF - induced transcription of the serum response element ( SRE ) . Expression of Cbl decreased — in a dose - dependent manner — transcription of SRE triggered by EGF ( Fig . 4a ) , whereas co - expression of CIN85 - 3SH3 or CIN85 - PCC , but not CIN85 , led to a reduction in the ability of Cbl to block EGF - induced SRE activity ( Fig . 4a ) . Therefore , the full inhibitory effect of Cbl on EGF receptor signalling depends on its interactions with a func - tional CIN85 protein . The fact that CIN85 - PCC , which does not bind to Cbl , was also sufﬁcient to reduce the inhibitory effects of Cbl supports the idea that CIN85 - PCC interacting proteins mediate , in part , the inhibitory effects of Cbl on EGF receptor signalling . Identiﬁcation of ligand - inducible interactions between the EGF receptors and a CIN85 – endophilin complex has shed new light on the mechanisms involved in the regulation of receptor endocytosis , as well as receptor - mediated signalling 4 , 5 .

Trans - location of endophilins in the vicinity of active EGF receptors promotes membrane invagination and thus receptor internaliz - ation , by acting together with other regulatory components of endocytic vesicle formation , including the GTPase dynamin 7 , 9 , 17 . Accordingly , it has been demonstrated that overexpression of a dominant interfering form of endophilin prevents c - Met receptor endocytosis and enhances receptor - mediated biological responses 22 . The present study has also indicated a role for CIN85 in the control of post - membrane events such as targeting receptors for degradation and regulation of gene transcription ( Figs 3b and 4a ) . CIN85 may control these processes by binding to multiple adaptor proteins ( for example , Crk 15 , p130Cas 15 and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase 12 ) involved in cross - talk between endosome and the actin cytoskeleton . The ability of CIN85 to assemble larger Cbl - associated signalling networks places it in a position to coordinate multiple steps in the endocytosis of tyrosine kinase receptors . Deﬁning how this process is regulated in living cells will be the challenge for future investigations .

Ligand - dependent downregulation of tyrosine kinase receptors is a critical step for modulating their activity . Upon ligand binding , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) receptor ( Met ) is polyubiquitinated 1 and degraded 2 ; however , the mechanisms underlying HGF receptor endocytosis are not yet known . Here we demonstrate that a complex involving endophilins , CIN85 and Cbl controls this process . Endophilins 3 are regulatory com - ponents of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . Through their acyl - transferase activity they are thought to modify the membrane phospholipids and induce negative curvature and invagination of the plasma membrane during the early steps of endocytosis 4 . Furthermore , by means of their Src - homology 3 domains , endo - philins are able to bind CIN85 , a recently identiﬁed protein that interacts with the Cbl proto - oncogene 5 . Cbl , in turn , binds and ubiquitinates activated HGF receptor , and by recruiting the endophilin – CIN85 complex , it regulates receptor internaliz - ation . Inhibition of complex formation is sufﬁcient to block HGF receptor internalization and to enhance HGF - induced signal transduction and biological responses . These data provide further evidence of a relationship between receptor - mediated signalling and endocytosis , and disclose a novel functional role for Cbl in HGF receptor signalling . Cell stimulation with growth factors usually leads to increased receptor tyrosine kinase activity , intracellular substrate recruitment , receptor internalization by accelerated endocytosis through cla - thrin - coated pits , and ﬁnally , degradation 6 – 8 . Several data sets suggest that ligand - dependent internalization may be a principal process regulating the duration and propagation of the signal initiated by tyrosine kinase receptors , thereby preventing over - stimulation that could potentially lead to cellular transformation . To clarify the molecular mechanisms connecting receptor - mediated signalling to endocytosis by means of clathrin - coated pits , we searched for proteins interacting with endophilins , by using the yeast two - hybrid system . A bait construct , encoding the full - length human endophilin A3 , fused in - frame with the Gal4 DNA - binding domain , was used to screen a human brain complementary DNA library . Approximately 500 , 000 transformants were analysed , leading to isolation of 27 positive colonies . Sequence analysis of the prey plasmids revealed that ﬁve of them encoded for dynamins ( well known interactors of endophilins ) 9 , whereas three clones of differ - ent length represented overlapping cDNAs for CIN85 ( Fig . 1a ) . CIN85 is a member of a newly discovered subfamily of adaptor molecules including CMS 10 and CD2AP 11 , and was recently shown to bind the Cbl proto - oncogene product 5 . CIN85 contains three amino - terminal Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains , followed by a proline - rich domain containing two sequences ( PKKPPPP and PKKPRPP ) that are optimal consensus sites for endophilin SH3 binding 12 and a carboxy - terminal coiled - coil domain , essential for dimerization 13 . As shown in Fig . 1b , pull - down experiments con - ﬁrmed that a recombinant glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein encoding full - length endophilin A3 was able to interact with letters to nature NATURE | VOL 416 | 14 MARCH 2002 | www . nature . com 187 © 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd enzyme is not required for this proton pumping in the reductive phase . Proton pumping only occurs on injection of the second electron . This is notable because in the oxidative phase of the cycle a single electron seems to be sufﬁcient , and may indicate that more redox energy per electron is available in the oxidative part of the cycle . The usage of the proton transfer pathways is partially different . The charge - compensating proton appears to be taken up by means of the K - pathway in the E to R transition ( in contrast to the prediction of ref . 4 ) , but through the D - pathway in the F to O transition ( Fig . 2b and ref . 21 ) . The D - pathway , however , is required for proton pumping in both cases . The mechanism of proton - pumping itself remains to be elucidated . A Methods The proteoliposomes of wild - type or D124N cytochrome c oxidase were prepared as described 9 . Forthespectroscopicmeasurements , 500 m lproteoliposomescontaining6 m M or20 m Menzyme weremixed with500 m lof50mM HEPES / KOH buffer , pH 7 . 4 , 100mM b - D - glucose in an anaerobic cuvette , degassed and overlaid with argon . After recording a reference spectrum for the oxidized form of the enzyme ( O ) , a 100 - fold molar excess of hydrogen peroxide and 40 m g glucose oxidase were added to form state F . Next , we added 25 m gcatalase , andthecuvettewasﬂushedwithcarbonmonoxideinthedark . Werecorded optical absorbance spectra every 90s . For comparison the same procedure was used with 10 m M solubilized D124N mutant enzyme in the presence of 0 . 05 % dodecyl - b - D - maltoside as detergent . The photopotential was measured as described 9 . Proteoliposomes were adsorbed to a planarlipidmembrane ( proteinconcentrationinthecuvetteapproximately100nM ) , and the potential was measured across the proteoliposome / planar membrane system . The states E or F were prepared as described above for the spectroscopic measurements . Next , the cytochrome c oxidase was reduced upon laser - ﬂash excitation of tris ( 2 , 2 0 - bipyridyl ) ruthenium , a photoactivatable electron donor .
