To elucidate the nature of the mechanical properties that provide this protec - tion , we measure the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties of networks of neuroﬁlaments . These networks are soft solids that exhibit dramatic strain stiffening above critical strains of 30 – 70 % . Surprisingly , divalent ions such as Mg 2 þ , Ca 2 þ , and Zn 2 þ act as effective cross - linkers for neuroﬁlament networks , controlling their solidlike elastic response . This behavior is comparable to that of actin - binding proteins in reconstituted ﬁlamentous actin . We show that the elasticity of neuroﬁlament networks is entropic in origin and is consistent with a model for cross - linked semiﬂexible networks , which we use to quantify the cross - linking by divalent ions . INTRODUCTION The mechanical and functional properties of cells depend largely on their cytoskeleton , which is comprised of net - works of biopolymers that include microtubules , actin , and intermediate ﬁlaments . A complex interplay of the mechanics of these networks provides cytoskeletal structure with the relative importance of the individual networks depending strongly on the type of cell ( 1 ) . The complexity of the intermingled structure and the mechanical behavior of these networks in vivo has led to extensive in vitro studies of networks of individual biopolymers . Many of these studies have focused on reconstituted networks of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) , which dominates the mechanics of the cyto - skeleton of many cells ( 2 – 7 ) . However , intermediate ﬁla - ments also form an important network in the cytoskeleton of many cells ; moreover , in some cells they form the most important network . For example , in mature axons , neuroﬁla - ments , a type IV intermediate ﬁlament , are the most abun - dant cytoskeletal element , overwhelming the amount of actin and outnumbering microtubules by more than an order of magnitude ( 8 ) . Neuroﬁlaments ( NFs ) are assembled from three polypeptide subunits , NF - light ( NF - L ) , NF - medium ( NF - M ) , and NF - heavy ( NF - H ) , with molecular masses of 68 kDa , 150 kDa , and 200 kDa , respectively ( 8 ) . They have a diameter of d ~ 10 nm , a persistence length believed to be of order l p ~ 0 . 2 m m , an in vitro contour length of L ~ 5 m m , and an in vivo contour length of L I ~ 1 . 8 m m ( 9 , 10 ) . They share with all other intermediate ﬁlaments a conserved sequence that is responsible for the formation of coiled dimers that eventually assemble into tetramers and ﬁnally into ﬁlaments . Unlike other intermediate ﬁla - ments , such as vimentin and desmin , NFs have long carboxy terminal extensions that protrude from the ﬁlament backbone ( 11 ) . These highly charged side arms lead to signiﬁcant inter - actions among individual ﬁlaments , as well as between ﬁla - ments and ions ( 12 ) . Networks of NFs are weakly elastic ; however , these networks are able to withstand large strains and exhibit pronounced stiffening with increasing strain ( 13 , 14 ) . An understanding of the underlying origin of this elastic behavior remains elusive ; in particular , even the nature of the cross - linkers , which must be present in such a network , is not known . Such an understanding of the fundamental mechanical properties of these networks of NFs is an essential ﬁrst step in elucidating the role of NFs in a multitude of diseases ( 15 ) . However , the elastic behavior of these networks has not as yet been systematically studied . Here , we report the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties of networks of NFs . Although it is well known that the addition of Mg 2 þ is necessary for network gelation , the speciﬁc role of Mg 2 þ in relation to network elasticity remains a mystery . In particular , we show that these net - works form cross - linked gels analogous to molecularly linked actin networks ; the cross - linking is governed by diva - lent ions such as Mg 2 þ at physiologically relevant millimolar concentrations ( 16 ) . To explain the origins of the network’s elasticity , we apply a semiﬂexible polymer model that ascribes the network elasticity to the stretching of thermal ﬂuctuations ; this quantitatively accounts for the linear and nonlinear elasticity of NF networks , and ultimately even allows us to extract microstructural network parameters such as the persistence length and the average distance between cross - links directly from bulk rheology . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials NFs were puriﬁed from bovine spinal cords using a standard procedure ( 11 , 17 , 18 ) . The fresh tissue was homogenized in the presence of buffer A ( 0 . 1 M Mes , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EGTA , pH 6 . 8 ) and then centrifuged Submitted August 26 , 2009 , and accepted for publication January 28 , 2010 . * Correspondence : nyao @ fas . harvard . edu Editor : Alexander Mogilner .

The crude NF pellet was puriﬁed overnight on a discontinuous sucrose gradient with 0 . 8 M sucrose ( 5 . 9 ml ) , 1 . 5 M sucrose ( 1 . 3 ml ) , and 2 . 0 M sucrose ( 1 . 0 ml ) . After overnight sedi - mentation , the concentration of the puriﬁed NF was determined with a Brad - ford Assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard . The puriﬁed NF was dialyzed against buffer A containing 0 . 8 M sucrose for 76 h , and 120 - m l aliquots were then ﬂash - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:3) C . Bulk rheology The mechanical response of the cross - linked NF networks was measured with a stress - controlled rheometer ( HR Nano , Malvern Instruments , Worces - tershire , UK ) using a 20 - mm - diameter 2 (cid:3) stainless steel cone plate geometry and a gap size of 50 m m . Before rheological testing , the NF samples were thawed on ice , after which they were quickly pipetted onto the stainless steel bottom plate of the rheometer in the presence of varying concentrations of Mg 2 þ . We utilized a solvent trap to prevent our networks from drying . To measure the linear viscoelastic moduli , we utilized a large - amplitude oscillatory shear measurement ( LAOS ) ; we applied an oscillatory stress of the form s ( t ) ¼ A sin ( u t ) , where A is the amplitude of the stress and u is the frequency . The resulting strain was of the form g ( t ) ¼ B sin ( u t þ d ) and yields the storage modulus G 0 ( u ) ¼ A / B cos ( d ) and the loss modulus G 00 ( u ) ¼ A / B sin ( d ) . To determine the frequency dependence of the linear moduli , G 0 ( u ) , G 00 ( u ) were sampled over a range of frequencies from 0 . 006 to 25 rad / s . In addition , we probed the stress dependence of the network response by measuring G 0 ( u ) , G 00 ( u ) at a single frequency , varying the amplitude of the oscillatory stress . To probe nonlinear behavior , we utilized a differential measurement , an effective probe of the tangent elastic modulus , which for a viscoelastic solid such as NFs provides consistent nonlinear measurements of elasticity in comparison to other nonlinear methods ( 19 – 21 ) . A small oscillatory stress was superimposed on a steady prestress , s , resulting in a total stress of the form s ( t ) ¼ s þ j ds j sin ( u t ) . The resultant strain was g ( t ) ¼ g þ j dg j sin ( u t þ f ) , yielding a differential elastic modulus K 0 ( s ) ¼ ds / dg cos ( f ) and a differential viscous modulus K 00 ( s ) ¼ ds / dg sin ( f ) ( 2 ) . Scaling parameters To compare the experiments with theory , we collapsed the differential measurements into a single master curve by scaling the stiffness , K 0 , and stress , s , by two free parameters for each data set . According to theory , the stiffness versus stress should have a single universal form apart from these two scale factors . We determined the scale factors by cubic - spline ﬁtting the data sets to piecewise polynomials ; these polynomials were then scaled onto the predicted stiffening curve using a least - squares regression . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To quantify the mechanical properties of NFs , we probed the linear viscoelastic moduli of the network during gelation , which takes approximately 1 h ; we characterized this by continuously measuring the linear viscoelastic moduli at a single frequency , u ¼ 0 . 6 rad / s . Gelation of these networks was initiated by the addition of millimolar amounts of Mg 2 þ , and during this process we found that the linear viscoelastic moduli increased rapidly before reaching a plateau value . We measured the frequency dependence of the linear viscoelastic moduli over a range of NF and Mg 2 þ concentrations . To ensure that we were probing the linear response , we main - tained a maximum applied stress amplitude of < 0 . 01 Pa , corresponding to strains < 5 % . We found that the linear moduli are frequency - independent for all tested frequencies , 0 . 006 – 25 rad / s . In addition , NF networks behave as a visco - elastic solid for all ranges of Mg 2 þ concentrations tested and the linear storage modulus is always at least an order of magnitude greater than the linear loss modulus ( Fig . 1 ) . This is indicative of a cross - linked gel and allows us to deﬁne a plateau elastic modulus , G 0 ( 22 ) . The elasticity of NF networks is highly nonlinear ; above critical strains , g c , of 30 – 70 % , the networks show stiffening up to LAOS strains of 300 % ( 23 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . A shear strain of 300 % corresponds to at most a 150 % extensional strain on the ﬁlament level . LAOS deforms a material through a range of stress states throughout both the linear and nonlinear regime , and deconvoluting this information to determine an effective strain is thus difﬁcult . It is also important to note that stress - controlled LAOS measures only the ﬁrst harmonic strain response and ignores higher harmonic contributions to the strain . For highly nonlinear materials , such as NF networks , the LAOS strain is thus unreliable . The measurements in Fig . 2 qualitatively demonstrate the nonlinearity of the networks , which occurs for a wide variety of Mg 2 þ and NF concentrations . In addition , by varying the MF concentration , c NF , and the Mg 2 þ concentration , c Mg , we can ﬁnely tune the linear storage modulus , G 0 , over a wide range of values ( Fig . 3 ) . The strong dependence of G 0 on Mg 2 þ concentration is reminiscent of actin networks cross - linked with incompliant cross - linkers such as scruin and heavy meromyosin ( 2 , 24 – 26 ) , which suggests that in the case of NFs , Mg 2 þ effectively acts as a cross - linker , leading to the formation of a viscoelastic network . Within this model , the NFs are cross - linked ionically on length scales compa - rable to their persistence length ; hence , they should behave as a cross - linked semiﬂexible biopolymer network . We therefore hypothesize that the network elasticity is purely due to the stretching out of transverse thermal ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments , which are assumed to be inextensible . These thermally driven ﬂuctuations reduce NF extension , resulting in an entropic spring . To consider these entropic effects , we A B FIGURE 1 The frequency dependence of the linear viscoelastic moduli of cross - linked networks for a variety of NF and Mg 2 þ concentrations . ( A ) Variations of the moduli at constant Mg 2 þ concentration ( 5 mM ) and changing ﬁlament concentration . ( B ) Variations of the moduli at constant NF concentration ( 1 . 5 mg / ml ) and changing Mg 2 þ concentration .

A convincing test of the hypothesis of entropic elasticity , as well as of the role of divalent ions as cross - linkers between NFs , is the nonlinear behavior of the net - work . When the thermal ﬂuctuations are pulled out by increasing strain , the elastic modulus of the network exhibits a pronounced increase . To probe this nonlinear elasticity of NF networks , we measured the differential or tangent elastic modulus K 0 ( s ) at a constant frequency , u ¼ 0 . 6 rad / s for a variety of NF and Mg 2 þ concentrations . If the network elasticity is indeed entropic in origin , this can provide a natural explanation for the nonlinear behavior in terms of the nonlinear elastic force - extension response of individual ﬁlaments that deform uniformly according to the macroscopic strain ﬁeld . Here , the force required to extend a single ﬁlament diverges as the length approaches the full extension , l c , according to F N ~ l / ( l - l c ) 2 ( 27 – 29 ) . Provided the network deformation is afﬁne , its macroscopic shear stress is primarily due to the stretching and compression of the individual elements of the network . The expected divergence of the single - ﬁlament tension leads to a scaling of dF / dl ~ F N 3 / 2 ; we therefore expect a scaling of network stiffness with stress of the form K 0 ( s ) ~ s 3 / 2 in the highly nonlinear regime ( 2 ) . Indeed , NF networks formed in the presence of divalent ions show remarkable consistency with this afﬁne thermal model for a wide range of NF and Mg 2 þ concentrations ( Fig . 4 ) . This consistency provides evidence of the entropic nature of the network’s nonlinear elasticity ( 2 , 28 ) . The afﬁne thermal model also suggests that the functional form of the data should be identical for all values of c NF and the concentration of the proposed ionic cross - links , c Mg . To test this , we scaled all the data sets for K 0 ( s ) onto a single master curve . This is accomplished by scaling the modulus by a factor ~ G and the stress by a factor ~ s . Consistent with the theoretical prediction , all the data from various NF and Mg 2 þ concentrations can indeed be scaled onto a universal curve ( Fig . 5 ) . The scale factor for the modulus is the linear shear modulus ~ G ¼ G 0 , whereas the scale factor for the stress is a measure of the critical stress , s c , at which the network begins to stiffen . This collapse provides additional evidence that the nonlinear elasticity of cross - linked NF networks is due to the entropy associated with single ﬁla - ment stretching . To explore the generality of the ionic cross - linking behavior , we used other divalent ions , including Ca 2 þ and Zn 2 þ . We found that the effects of both of these ions on the nonlinear rheological behavior are nearly identical to those of Mg 2 þ ; they also cross - link NF networks into weak elastic gels . This lack of dependence on the speciﬁc FIGURE 2 The strain - stiffening behavior of NF networks at various Mg 2 þ and NF concentrations . G 0 is the elastic modulus ( solid squares ) and G 00 the viscous modulus ( open squares ) . Dramatic nonlinearities are seen at critical strains ranging from 30 % to 70 % . FIGURE 3 The linear elastic modulus , G 0 , as a function of c NF and c Mg . The network elasticity can be ﬁnely tuned over an order of magnitude by varying the concentration of the cross - linker Mg 2 þ and the NF concentra - tion . The essential role of Mg 2 þ as a network cross - linker is evinced by the markedly stronger dependence on c NF for increasing divalent ion concentration . FIGURE 4 The dependence of K 0 ( s ) on s for a variety of NF and Mg 2 þ concentrations . The effects of varying c Mg at a constant ﬁlament concentra - tion of 1 . 5 mg / ml and c NF at a constant divalent ion concentration of 5 mM are shown . As expected , the linear elastic modulus and the breakage stress differ ; however , all data show an exponent of ~ 3 / 2 ( black line ) , in agreement with the afﬁne thermal model . Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2147 – 2153 Elasticity of Neuroﬁlament Networks 2149 ionic cross - link lends evidence that the interaction between ﬁlaments and ions is electrostatic in nature . The ability to scale all data sets of K 0 ( s ) onto a single universal curve also provides a means to convincingly conﬁrm that the linear elasticity is entropic in origin . Further - more , with a scaling analysis we can demonstrate that the typical distance between cross - links in the network is deter - mined by the concentration of divalent ions . To accomplish this , we derived an expression from a microscopic model that relates the two scaling parameters G 0 and s c to each other . The force required for a small extension , d l , of a thermally ﬂuctuating semiﬂexible polymer segment of length l c can be derived from the wormlike chain model , giving F 0 ~ ( k 2 / k B T ) d l / l c4 . Assuming an afﬁne deformation , and accounting for an isotropic distribution of ﬁlaments , the full expression for the linear elastic modulus of the network is given by G 0 ¼ 6 r k B T ‘ 2p ‘ 3c ; ( 1 ) where k ¼ k B Tl p is the bending rigidity of NFs , k B T is the thermal energy , and r is the ﬁlament - length density ( 2 , 28 , 30 – 32 ) . The density r is also proportional to the mass density c NF , and is related to the mesh size , x , of the network by x (cid:4) 1 = ﬃﬃﬃ r p ( 33 ) . Although the inverse root dependence is general , the precise prefactor depends on the geometry of the network ; for instance , for an ordered cubic network , the precise expression is x ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 3 = r p . Furthermore , the model predicts a characteristic ﬁlament tension proportional to k / l c2 , and a corresponding characteristic stress ( 2 , 24 , 28 ) s c ¼ r k B T ‘ p ‘ 2c : ( 2 ) In principle , divalent ions could be playing a much more complicated role than simply cross - linking the network ; for example , if the ions were also affecting single - ﬁlament parameters such as the persistence length , then the direct analogy to molecular linkers would not provide a complete picture . Combining Eqs . 1 and 2 allows us to scale out the cross - linking distance , leaving only a dependence on temperature and the ﬁlament persistence length . In this case , we would expect the scaling c NF1 / 2 G 0 ~ s c3 / 2 , where the prefactor should depend only on k B T and l p ; although the prefactor will differ for different types of ﬁlaments , it should be the same for different networks composed of the same ﬁlament type and at the same temperature , such as in our case . Thus , plotting c NF1 / 2 G 0 as a function of s c for different NF networks at the same temperature should result in collapse of the data onto a single curve characterized by a 3 / 2 power law . This even includes systems with different divalent ions or different ionic concentrations . For a variety of divalent ions and different ionic concentrations , we ﬁnd that c NF1 / 2 G 0 ~ s c z , where z ¼ 1 . 54 5 0 . 14 , in excellent agreement with this model ( Fig . 6 ) . It is essential to note that the 3 / 2 exponent found here is not a direct consequence of the 3 / 2 exponent obtained in Fig . 5 , which characterizes the highly nonlinear regime . Instead , the plot of c NF1 / 2 G 0 as a function of s c probes the underlying mechanism and extent of the linear elastic regime . Although the slope of 3 / 2 captures the entropic stretching , the intercept of the y axis is set by the persistence length . Thus , the collapse of the data onto a single master curve for various ionic species and concentrations indicates that varying divalent ion concentration does not have a signiﬁcant effect on l p . This implies that the strong depen - dence of the linear and nonlinear rheological properties of NF networks on c Mg is largely due to the dependence of l c FIGURE 5 Collapse ofall data setsof the s dependenceof K 0 ontoa single universal curve . The scaling parameters are G 0 , the linear elastic modulus , and s c , the critical stress . These parameters are calculated using a least - squares regression . Data shown represent varying ﬁlament concentrations from 0 . 5 to 2 . 2 mg / ml and varying divalent ion concentrations from 2 to 8 mM . The data points at the high - stress end that show a downturn just before network failure are likely due to network breakage and are therefore removed to avoid improper inﬂuence on regression parameters . FIGURE 6 The dependence of c NF1 / 2 G 0 on s c . The solid line is the result of a regression ﬁt to the data and depicts an exponent of 1 . 54 . This is in agreement with the afﬁne thermal model , which predicts an exponent of 3 / 2 . Data were obtained for Mg 2 þ ( solid squares ) , Ca 2 þ ( open squares ) , and Zn 2 þ ( crossed squares ) . ( Inset ) Dependence of G 0 on c NF . An exponent of 2 . 5 was obtained from regression . This is also consistent with the afﬁne thermal model , which predicts an exponent of 2 . 2 . Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2147 – 2153 2150 Yao et al . on c Mg , supporting the claim that divalent ions are acting as effective cross - linkers between NFs . We expect cross - linking to occur on the scale of the entanglement length , l e (cid:4) l 1 = 5 p = r 2 = 5 , which sets the typical distance for binary collisions between thermally ﬂuctuating semiﬂexible polymer chains . For a ﬁxed - ratio mole ratio , R , of Mg 2 þ to NFs , l c ~ c NF (cid:2) 2 / 5 ( 28 , 30 , 34 , 35 ) . Thus , insert - ing this concentration dependence into Eq . 1 , we expect the linear storage modulus to scale with NF concentration as G 0 ~ c NF11 / 5 ( 28 , 30 ) . For R ¼ 1000 , we ﬁnd an approxi - mate scaling of G 0 ~ c NF2 . 5 , consistent with the predicted power law ( Fig . 6 ) . It is interesting that the stronger concen - tration dependence of G 0 may be a consequence of the dense cross - linking we observe . Speciﬁcally , for densely cross - linked networks corresponding to a minimum l c on the order of the typical spacing between ﬁlaments , x , as we observe here , the model in Eq . 1 predicts G 0 ~ c NF2 . 5 ( 28 ) . The agree - ment with the afﬁne thermal model in both the linear and nonlinear regimes conﬁrms the existence of an ionically cross - linked NF gel whose elasticity is due to the pulling out of thermal ﬂuctuations . The ability of the afﬁne thermal model to explain the elas - ticity of the NF network also suggests that we should be able to quantitatively extract network parameters from the bulk rheology . The model predicts that l p ¼ 1 36 r k B TG 20 s 3c ( 3 ) and l c ¼ 1 6 r k B TG 0 s 2c ; ( 4 ) where r z 2 . 1 (cid:5) 10 13 m (cid:2) 2 for NF networks at a concentration of 1 mg / mL . This yields a persistence length l p z 0 . 2 m m , which is in excellent agreement with previous single - ﬁlament measurements ( 10 ) . In addition , we ﬁnd that l c z 0 . 3 m m , which is close to the theoretical mesh size x z 1 = ﬃﬃﬃ r p z 0 : 26 m m . Surprisingly , this is far below the mesh size of 4 m m inferred from tracer particle motion ( 1 ) . Such particle tracking only provides an indirect measure : in weakly cross - linked networks , for instance , even particles that are larger than the average interﬁlament spacing will tend to diffuse slowly . At a given concentration , particles substantially larger than the average mesh size can move through a meshwork that is highly inhomogeneous with large voids . Within the limits of the resolution of confocal images , we were able to rule out signiﬁcant network bundling and a large inhomoge - neous mesh size . These limitsprevent us from directly extract - ing a value for the mesh size , but allow us to estimate an upper bound on the mesh size of ~ 1 m m . This would , for instance , rule out signiﬁcant bundling of the network . To further elucidate the cross - linking behavior of Mg 2 þ , we explored the dependence of l c on both c Mg and c NF . Within the afﬁne thermal model , we expect the cross - linking distance to be governed by the concentration of a speciﬁc molecular cross - linker , which sets the average distance between cross - link nodes . The exact form of the dependence of l c on the concentration of cross - links depends on the details of the biochemical interaction , the effectiveness of the cross - linking , and the level of cross - link saturation . For a variety of molecular cross - linking proteins , the dependence of l c on cross - linker concentration is well described by a power law . However , the exponent of this power law depends on the properties of the speciﬁc cross - linker : Thus , assuming that Mg 2 þ is acting as a cross - linker , the ﬁlling fraction of potential binding sites for effective cross - linking between two ﬁlaments scales as R X . Since topological entanglements between neighboring ﬁlaments set the lengthscale for cross - linking , we would expect that l c (cid:4) l e = R X , implying that for ﬁxed c NF , l c ~ c Mg (cid:2) X , whereas for ﬁxed R , l c ~ c NF (cid:2) 2 / 5 . Naively , we would expect that X z 1 , which implies that doubling the concentration of Mg 2 þ would halve the average distance between cross - links . Empirically , we ﬁnd a much weaker dependence on c Mg , where l c ~ c Mg (cid:2) 0 . 2 at constant c NF ( Fig . 7 ) . A similarly weak dependence was seen previously with actin networks in the presence of heavy meromysin where X was found to be 0 . 4 ( 26 ) . We note that there is an excess of Mg 2 þ ions available for cross - linking , since the number density of cross - links / m 3 is N C ¼ r = l c z 7 : 5 (cid:5) 10 19 m (cid:2) 3 , whereas the number density of ions in a standard 5 - mM Mg 2 þ concentra - tion is N z 30 (cid:5) 10 23 . Although it is likely that multiple ions mediate a single cross - link , these numbers suggest that only a small fraction of the ions are involved in forming effective network cross - links . This saturation of ionic cross - links may be responsible for the observed weak power law in the concentration dependence of l c on c Mg . In addition , we found that at a constant molar ratio , l c ~ c NF (cid:2) 0 . 5 , consistent with the predicted (cid:2) 2 / 5 exponent ( Fig . 7 , inset ) . The direct depen - dence of the cross - linking distance l c on c Mg further conﬁrms FIGURE 7 Dependence of l c on c NF at a ﬁxed molar ratio of 1000 . The solid line is the result of a regression ﬁt and exhibits an exponent of (cid:2) 0 . 5 . This is consistent with the afﬁne thermal model , which predicts an exponent of (cid:2) 2 / 5 .

Biophysical Journal 98 ( 10 ) 2147 – 2153 Elasticity of Neuroﬁlament Networks 2151 the role of Mg 2 þ as the effective ionic cross - linker of the NF networks . We propose that divalent ions mediate an effective cross - linking interaction similar to traditional molecular cross - linking proteins . The generality of this cross - linking behavior for various divalent ion species suggests that this interaction may be purely electrostatic in nature . NF side arms are negatively charged , ﬂexible , thermally collapsed chains , and we envision that the divalent ions are interwoven into the entangled side - arm structure . Although side arms of one chain will likely cross - link within themselves , only cross - links between two different chains will contribute to network elasticity . This cross - linking will likely involve many side arms of one ﬁlament interacting with the backbone and side arms of another ﬁlament . Remarkably , increasing the concentration of the proposed ionic cross - linker enhances the network toughness by increasing the breakage stress by almost an order of magnitude ( Fig . 4 ) . Our ﬁndings demonstrate both the entropic origin of NF network elasticity and the role of Mg 2 þ as an effective ionic cross - linker . CONCLUSIONS We measured the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties of cross - linked NF solutions over a wide range Mg 2 þ and NF concentrations . NFs are interesting intermediate ﬁlament networks whose nonlinear elasticity has not been studied systematically . We show that the NF networks form densely cross - linked gels , whose elasticity can be well understood within an afﬁne entropic framework . We provide direct quan - titative calculations of l p and l c from bulk rheology using this model . Furthermore , our data provides evidence that Mg 2 þ acts as the effective ionic cross - linker in the NF networks . The weaker - than - expected dependence we observe suggests that Mg 2 þ may be near saturation in our networks . Future experimental work with other multivalent ions is required to better understand the electrostatic interaction between ﬁla - ments and cross - links ; this would lead to a better microscopic understanding of the effects of electrostatic interactions in the cross - linking of NF networks . Moreover , the effect of divalent ions on the cross - linking of networks of other inter - mediate ﬁlaments would be very interesting to explore .
