Particularly the close 36 contact of persons living together or cohabitating in domestic quarantine could result in high 37 risk for exposure to the virus within the households . Therefore , the aim of this study was to 38 investigate the whereabouts of the virus and whether useful precautions to prevent the 39 dissemination can be given . 40 21 households under quarantine conditions were randomly selected for this study . All persons 41 living in each household were recorded in terms of age , sex and time of household quarantine . 42 Throat swabs for analysis were obtained from all adult individuals and most of the children . Air , 43 wastewater samples and surface swabs ( commodities ) were obtained and analysed by RT - 44 PCR . Positive swabs were cultivated to analyse for viral infectivity . 45 26 of all 43 tested adults ( 60 . 47 % ) tested positive by RT - PCR . All 15 air samples were PCR - 46 negative . 10 of 66 wastewater samples were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( 15 . 15 % ) as well as 4 47 of 119 object samples ( 3 . 36 % ) .

No infectious virus could be isolated under cell culture conditions . 50 As we cannot rule out transmission through surfaces , hygienic behavioural measures are 51 important in the households of SARS - CoV - 2 infected individuals to avoid potential 52 transmission through surfaces . The role of the domestic environment , in particular the 53 wastewater load in washbasins and showers , in the transmission of SARS CoV - 2 should be 54 further clarified . 55 56 Keywords 57 SARS - CoV - 2 ; COVID - 19 ; hygiene measures ; environment ; quarantine ; airborne transmission 58 All rights reserved .

Over 5 million cases and almost 350 , 000 deaths have 61 been reported so far ( WHO , 2020a , data as of 23rd may 2020 ) . Thus , the COVID - 19 pandemic 62 challenges the environmental hygiene : special isolation and infectious disease wards have 63 been established in hospitals and healthcare facilities and whole households have been 64 quarantined . Hence , comprehensive monitoring of the environment of healthcare facilities and 65 households during pandemic outbreaks are vital parts to ensure patients’ safety and public 66 health ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . 67 COVID - 19 is a disease of the upper airways ( Schmithausen et al . , 2020 ) . It has been shown 68 for SARS - CoV - 2 that droplets ( particles > 5 µm ) can deposit on mucous surfaces of the upper 69 respiratory tract and be spread when coughing , sneezing or speaking ( Anfinrud et al . , 2020 ; Li 70 et al . , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) Thus , the main airborne transmission pathway of infectious SARS - 71 CoV - 2 is aerosol ( particles < 5 µm ) or droplets ( van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) . This is particularly 72 important regarding indoor environments , because small particles with a higher viral load may 73 be carried over distances up to 10 m from the emission source and may even accumulate 74 ( Morawska and Cao , 2020 ; Paules et al . , 2020 ) . However , these findings are based on 75 laboratory experiments . One of a few on - field outbreaks studies on environmental transmission 76 dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 was performed by Xu et al . ( 2020 ) on a cruise ship with a total of 77 3 , 711 passengers . Xu et al . ( 2020 ) rebutted that long - range airborne transmission routes and 78 even central air conditioning systems play a role in a COVID - 19 outbreak in a confined space . 79 On the other hand it can be assumed that close contact and fomites contribute to transmission 80 effects ( ECDC , 2020 ; WHO , 2020a ) . Chan et al . ( 2020 ) proofed person - to - person transmission 81 in hospital and family settings . Currently , only few on - field studies of SARS - CoV - 2 detected 82 RNA on door handles and surfaces in hospital and / or confirmed COVID - 19 in the patient´s 83 environment , particularly in Asia ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . However , the prevalence and potential 84 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 2 , 2020 . . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 05 . 28 . 20114041 doi : medRxiv preprint 5 transmission risks of SARS - CoV - 2 in the environment of infected persons of the general 85 population living with their families in households have not yet been sufficiently explored . 86 One important underlying question is whether and how long virus particles can survive on 87 various surfaces to enable human - to - surface - to - human transmission . To date , no case of 88 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from human to human via food , drinking water or fomites could 89 be demonstrated , although if there is speculation that in the early phase of virus spread in 90 China transmission might be food - borne associated ( Jalava , 2020 ) . Modelling also implies that 91 the indirect transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from environment is of little importance ( Ferretti et 92 al . , 2020 ) . In contrast , recent studies suggested that the environmental stability of the virus on 93 surfaces plays an important role in the transfer ( Otter et al . , 2016 ; van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) . 94 Studies also showed that the viable virus remained detectable for hours or even days in the 95 inanimate surroundings like the air , on stainless steel and plastic surfaces ( Kampf et al . , 2020 ; 96 Service , 2020 ) as well as in urine and faeces of formerly positive patients ( Holshue et al . , 2020 ; 97 Wang et al . , 2020c ; Wang et al . , 2020b ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA has been detected in the stool of 98 one of the first patients in the USA ( Holshue et al . , 2020 ) . This might be in line with the 99 observation of Wang et al . ( 2020 ) and Cheng et al . ( 2020 ) describing that at least 2 – 10 % of 100 patients with COVID - 19 show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting 101 ( Chen et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020a ) . Schmithausen et al . ( 2020 ) described persistent 102 diarrhoea in 32 % of tested persons . Following the wastewater pathway , SARS - CoV - 2 RNA 103 has already been found in the wastewater of hospitals treating COVID - 19 patients ( Wang et 104 al . , 2020c ) . In a lab - based experiment , coronavirus ( SARS - CoV - 1 ) was found to remain 105 infectious for 14 days at 4°C , and for 2 days at 20°C in hospital wastewater ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . 106 Yeo et al . ( 2020 ) highlight the potential of faecal - oral transmission . Thus , wastewater and 107 sanitation units represent potential infectious sources of SARS - CoV - 2 and colonization of the 108 sewage system with microorganisms already starts in the siphons of the washbasins , shower 109 siphons , as well as in the toilets ( KRINKO , 2020 ; Sib et al . , 2019 ) . When SARS - CoV - 2 infected 110 persons with gastrointestinal symptoms excrete urine and faeces , consequently SARS - CoV - 2 111 can be identified in the immediate surroundings like the sanitary facilities .

In order to test this assumption , the study presented here also collected on - field 116 samples of siphons and toilets in private households of COVID - 19 infected people . 117 The main exposure to and transmission of the virus occurs at home ( Qian et al . , 2020 ) , and in 118 cases of mild COVID - 19 progression , home care is implemented to avoid hospital overload 119 ( WHO , 2020b ) . Consequently , contact persons of positively tested people are also placed in 120 pre - emptive home isolation before the onset of symptoms due to the risk of contagion ( ECDC , 121 2020 ; WHO , 2020b ) . As a result , infected people and contact persons living together as a 122 family or in cohabitation are in domestic quarantine with each other . Even with separate 123 bathrooms and bedrooms , it is impossible to effectively and permanently distance oneself and 124 maintain adequate hand hygiene . 125 The aim of this study was to investigate the dissemination of virus in air , wastewater and on 126 items within the domestic environment of family households with at least one SARS - CoV - 2 127 positive family member , during a quarantine ordered by the local health department and to give 128 useful recommendations for infection prevention . 129 Material and Methods 130 Sample site and recruitment of households 131 Samples were obtained in a high - prevalence community setting with Germany ' s first largest 132 high - prevalence cluster with regard to COVID - 19 known at that point of time in March 2020 133 ( Streeck et al . , 2020b ; Streeck et al . , 2020a ) . The local health department provided lists of all 134 positively tested inhabitants who had been placed in domestic quarantine at the point of data 135 collection . 21 households , with at least one person tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA , were 136 randomly selected from this list . The respective residents were contacted by telephone and 137 informed about the study . All persons and their family members living under one roof agreed 138 All rights reserved .

Complete information from pharyngeal swabs was available for all 139 58 study participants ( 43 adults , 15 children ) living in 21 households . 140 Sampling 141 Age , sex and time of quarantine were recorded for all individuals living in each household . 142 Household was defined as people living together within one flat or one house and having 143 regularly and close contact nearly every day . Throat swabs for virologic diagnostics were 144 obtained from all adults described by Streeck et al . ( 2020b ) . 145 As this is an exploratory study , no standardised environmental sampling was carried out . 146 Furthermore , no characterization of cleaning methods or materials was performed . Critical 147 rooms and fomites were identified in each household by two researchers ( physicians or 148 virologists or hygienists or public health specialists ) in cooperation with the residents . The 149 focus of this study was on the air , wastewater and swab samples of as many different fomites 150 ( consumer goods and furnishings ) as possible with the WHO “how to” guide as a reference 151 ( WHO , 2020c ) . 152 Air samples were obtained employing cyclone sampling ( Verreault et al . , 2008 ) via Coriolis 153 Micro – Air sampler ( Bertin Technologies SAS , France ) . The air collectors were positioned in 154 the middle of the room that was used most frequently by the residents ; this was usually the 155 living room or the kitchen - all the rooms had no ventilation equipment . During sampling , close 156 contact to the air sampler ( e . g . speaking in a range below 2 metres but not above 3 metres ) 157 was avoided . Sampling was performed with 300 litres per minute for 10 minutes in 15 ml of 0 . 9 158 % NaCl . 159 Wastewater samples were obtained using sterile syringes and catheters to reach the 160 wastewater in the siphons of sinks , showers and toilets in bathrooms . Samples were only taken 161 when the sanitary facilities were shared between the residents . The air and wastewater 162 samples were stored and transported at + 4°C . 163 All rights reserved .

The residents 166 identified fomites of frequent and shared use ( e . g . door handles , remote control ) . All laboratory 167 analyses were performed within 48 hours . 168 Laboratory analysis 169 All samples were transported to the virologic laboratory within 6 hours of sampling . Virologic 170 analysis was performed via RT - PCR using the protocol of Corman et al . ( 2020 ) . Briefly , swab 171 samples were homogenized by short vertexing and 140 µl of the sample were transferred to a 172 sterile 2 ml microcentrifuge tube holding 560 µl AVL buffer ( Qiagen ) . Viral RNA was extracted 173 with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit ( Qiagen ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer . 174 The RNA was used as template for three real time RT - PCR reactions using SuperScript™III 175 One - Step RT - PCR System with Platinum™ TaqDNA Polymerase ( Thermo Fisher ) to amplify 176 sequences of the SARS - CoV - 2 E gene ( primers E _ Sarbeco _ F and R , probe E _ Sarbeco _ P1 ) , 177 the RdRP gene ( primers RdRP _ SARSr _ F , and R , and probe RdRP _ SARSr - P2 ) , and an 178 internal control for RNA extraction , reverse transcription , and amplification ( innuDETECT 179 Internal Control RNA Assay , Analytik Jena # 845 - ID - 0007100 ) . Samples were considered 180 positive for SARS - CoV - 2 if amplification occurred in both virus - specific reactions . 181 The isolation of infectious virus from environmental samples was attempted by seeding Vero 182 E6 cells in 24 well plates or T25 flasks at a density of 70 - 80 % . Cells were incubated with 200 183 µl ( 24 well ) – 1000 µl ( T25 flask ) of the sample material supplemented with 1x 184 penicillin / streptomycin / amphotericin B and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . For water 185 samples , 10 % ( v / v ) of inoculation volume was replaced by 10xPBS to obtain a final 186 concentration of 1xPBS . After 1 h of incubation , the inoculum was removed , Dulbecco’s 187 Modified Eagle’s medium ( Gibco ) with 3 % foetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and 1x 188 penicillin / streptomycin / amphotericin B was added .

An α = 0 . 05 was 193 considered statistically significant and all tests were 2 - tailed .

No correlation between PCR - positive 243 environmental samples and PCR - positive human samples could be found in this study ( χ 2 - 244 Test , p = 0 . 756 ) . There was no household with PCR - positive environmental samples and PCR - 245 negative human samples . 246 Discussion 247 The results indicate that at that early time of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak research in Germany the 248 contamination of the domestic environment is negligible during quarantine measured with the 249 current state of the art methods . We could not detect any viral RNA in air samples and only 250 3 . 36 % of all fomite samples . In contrast , 15 . 15 % of all wastewater samples were positive for 251 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA , which indicates that mouthwash in washbasins , body wash in the shower 252 and faeces in toilets and therefore wastewater could pose a relevant exposure ( Wu et al . , 253 2020 ) . Although RT - PCR is a highly sensitive detection method it does not yield information 254 on the infectivity of the virus in these samples . Attempts to isolate virus in cell culture were not 255 successful . Given the rather low cycle threshold ( CT ) values > 30 obtained in the RT - PCR 256 analysis of these samples , the amount of potential virus is estimated to be too low for virus 257 isolation in general . Indeed , virus isolation in cell culture has not been successful in our 258 laboratory at a CT value > 30 so far . Furthermore , several wastewater samples had a toxic 259 effect on the cells , which might be linked to detergent residues . It is therefore difficult to give 260 specific hygienic behaviour precautions but rather basic hygiene measures for dissemination 261 prevention ( KRINKO , 2020 ) . 262 With regard to the fomite and surface samples , only few positive PCR results were found in 263 this study . This might also be due to methodological problems . On the one hand , the 264 swab / transport solution combinations used could not have been suitable for keeping viral RNA 265 stable until it was analysed in the laboratory . Ideally , object swabs should cover 25 cm 2 and 266 be put into 2 ml of viral transport medium including neutralizing buffer to counteract the effects 267 All rights reserved .

On the other hand , we 268 observed positive PCR results in the throat swabs that were collected by the same 269 swab / transport combinations . Assuming that the results are not methodologically 270 inappropriate , they could indicate that the environmental survival of SARS - CoV - 2 may not be 271 too long in the domestic environment . The survival times of SARS - CoV - 2 on various dry 272 materials for different periods of time ( < 3 hours on printing and tissue papers , < 2 days on 273 wood and clothing , < 4 days on smooth surfaces , < 7 days on steel or plastic ) were investigated 274 by ( Chin et al . , 2020 ) . However , it should be noted that these data were generated under 275 laboratory conditions . It can be assumed that households in quarantine have a cleaning 276 regime , but even under these conditions viral RNA could be found on fomites in the 277 households . A further characterization of different cleaning systems ( frequency , cleaning 278 agents , ventilation of rooms , etc . ) would be necessary ; however , this effect could only be 279 validly estimated in observational studies , since a large bias towards social desirability can be 280 expected in surveys . 281 Following international recommendations , air samples should be taken as swabs of ventilation 282 exits or air purifier ventils ( WHO , 2020c ) . Since this is just a surrogate for real air contamination 283 and normally households in Germany are not equipped with ventilators or air purifiers , cyclone 284 air samplers were used . Cyclone samplers may be less efficient than other sampler types at 285 recovering low concentrations of airborne viruses due to the physical stress caused by 286 centrifugal force ( Bourgueil et al . , 1992 ) . However , a recent study using a cyclone air collector 287 to investigate air contamination in isolation rooms of a hospital ( Chia et al . , 2020 ) showed that 288 2 out of 3 collected samples were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . Further experimental 289 investigations of different air samplers in defined environments and preferably concerning 290 general population households would be necessary to exclude a method - related false low 291 recovery rate . However , these findings suggest that droplet transmission is the main pathway 292 of transmission and that aerosol transmission plays a rather minor role . According to this , 293 droplets and / or aerosols with SARS - CoV - 2 in a viable and infectious form can be formed while 294 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Although these differences were not found to be significant , 299 they support the above - mentioned hypothesis that aerosolization of viral loaded droplets from 300 these wastewater reservoirs can be possible . Even more , the viral load on the hands and in 301 the throat is highest and viral particles can be released from spitting into the washing basin 302 siphon after teeth brushing or hands washing . The excretion of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA via faeces 303 and urine has already been described ( van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) and could also lead to an 304 increased detection rate of viral RNA in the shower or toilet . 305 Thus , the wastewater system could serve as a possible surveillance system for the circulation 306 of the virus within several environments ( Medema et al . , 2020 ) . In general , wastewater requires 307 special hygienic attention , for example with regard to multidrug - resistant bacteria and antibiotic 308 residues ( Müller et al . , 2018 ; Sib et al . , 2019 ; Voigt et al . , 2020 ; Voigt et al . , 2019 ) , enteric 309 viruses like norovirus or rotavirus ( Lodder and Roda Husman , 2005 ) and coronavirus ( Gundy 310 et al . , 2009 ) . The enteric transmission of SARS - CoV led to a large outbreak cluster in 311 Hongkong in 2003 ( Leung et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , enteric dissemination of and exposure to 312 SARS - CoV - 2 via wastewater is also considered to be a main risk ( Lodder and Roda Husman , 313 2020 ) . Therefore , existing hygiene recommendations ( washing hands after contact with 314 wastewater , flushing the toilet with closed lid , avoiding re - contamination of drinking water 315 systems and domestic environment by wastewater ) are considered to be necessary to 316 sufficiently control this transmission route . Furthermore , preventive and intervention measures 317 should not start at the wastewater treatment in the treatment plant , but already in the immediate 318 surroundings of the patient , in order to minimize the infection potential . 319 All rights reserved .

Surfaces in the domestic environment did not show a high contamination rate 322 in this study , whereas the detection of viral RNA in wastewater of washbasins , showers and 323 toilets showed a significantly higher contamination with SARS - CoV - 2 , indicating a possible 324 reservoir that has not been considered so far . However , further systematic studies with an 325 adapted methodology should be performed to investigate the contamination of the domestic 326 environment and the interactions between humans , animals and the environment . 327 Furthermore , the possibility of transmission via wastewater has hygienic implications for 328 systematic prevention measures especially for areas with poor sanitation ( Carducci et al . 329 2020 ) . 330 Declaration of competing interest 331 The authors declare no conflict of interest .
