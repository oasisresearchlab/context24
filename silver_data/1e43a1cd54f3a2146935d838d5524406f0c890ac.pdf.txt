The NOMPC channel in the transient receptor potential ( TRP ) family , a mechanotransduction channel for Drosophila touch sensation and hearing , contains 29 Ankyrin repeats ( ARs ) that associate with microtu - bules . These ARs have been postulated to act as a tether that conveys force to the channel . Here , we report that these N - terminal ARs form a cyto - plasmic domain essential for NOMPC mechanogating in vitro , mechanosensitivity of touch receptor neurons in vivo , and touch - induced behaviors of Drosophila larvae . Duplicating the ARs elongates the ﬁlaments that tether NOMPC to microtubules in mechanosen - sory neurons . Moreover , microtubule association is required for NOMPC mechanogating . Importantly , transferring the NOMPC ARs to mechanoinsensitive voltage - gated potassium channels confers mechano - sensitivity to the chimeric channels . These experi - mentsstrongly support a tethermechanism ofmecha - nogating for the NOMPC channel , providing insights intothe basis ofmechanosensitivityofmechanotrans - duction channels . INTRODUCTION Mechanotransduction channels convert mechanical stimuli into neuronal signals ( Arnado´ttir and Chalﬁe , 2010 ; Coste et al . , 2012 ; Vollrath et al . , 2007 ) . Several models have been proposed regarding how the mechanical force triggers channel opening ( Kung , 2005 ; Lumpkin and Caterina , 2007 ; Orr et al . , 2006 ) . In the membrane force model , the force exerted via lipids in the membrane gates the channel . Alternatively , the tether model posits that the channel is tethered to intra - and / or extracellular structures and the force that is exerted by these molecular tethers gates the channel ( Gillespie and Walker , 2001 ; Orr et al . , 2006 ) . Those models are not mutually exclusive as the cell membrane and tethers may act in concert in transmitting forces to the channel gate . While there is considerable evidence supporting the membrane force model for the bacterial MscL channel ( Anishkin and Kung , 2013 ) and eukaryotic potassium channels ( Brohawn et al . , 2012 , 2014a , 2014b ; Lolicato et al . , 2014 ) , direct molecular evidence for the tether model has been lacking . In the tether model , both rigid and elastic cellular compo - nents are required to couple stimulus - induced displacements to the membrane - bound channel ( Lumpkin and Caterina , 2007 ) . The rigid structures are thought to be composed of intracellular cytoskeletal elements and / or extracellular matrix components ( Anishkin and Kung , 2013 ; Kung , 2005 ) , and microtubules have been found to be essential for the mecha - nogating of TRPV1 channels on cells undergoing hypertonici - ty - induced shrinking ( Prager - Khoutorsky et al . , 2014 ) . The molecular identities of the elastic components that transduce mechanical force to the channels and promote channel gating , however , remain unknown . Protein motifs that exhibit a certain level of elasticity have been suggested to function as gating springs that pull open the channels during mechanotransduc - tion . The stomatin - related protein Mec - 2 in the MEC channel complex of Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptors ( Goodman et al . , 2002 ; Hu et al . , 2010 ) , tip link proteins in vertebrate hair cells ( Grillet et al . , 2009 ; Morgan and Barr - Gillespie , 2013 ; Phil - lips et al . , 2008 ) , and Ankyrin repeats ( ARs ) domain of some TRP channels ( Gaudet , 2008 ; Howard and Bechstedt , 2004 ; Jin et al . , 2006 ; Sotomayor et al . , 2005b ) are all candidates for such elastic tethers . The Ankyrin domain of 33 residues is a structural motif implicated in protein - protein interactions ( Gaudet , 2008 ; Jin et al . , 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) . Domains with a large tandem array of ARs resemble a coil with elasticity ( Gaudet , 2008 ) , making them intriguing candidates . Among all known TRP channels , the NOMPC channel has the largest number of ARs ( Montell , 2004 , 2005 ) , which are important for NOMPC functions in larval locomotion ( Cheng et al . , 2010 ) . NOMPC fulﬁlls essentially all the criteria for a bona ﬁde mechano - transduction channel and mediates touch sensation in Drosophila larvae ( Arnado´ttir and Chalﬁe , 2010 ; Yan et al . , 2013 ) . NOMPC is also involved in the hearing of Drosophila larvae and adults ( Bech - stedt and Howard , 2008 ; Effertz et al . , 2011 ; Kamikouchi et al . , Cell 162 , 1391 – 1403 , September 10 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 1391 2009 ; Lehnert et al . , 2013 ; Liang et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ) , collective behavior of adult ﬂies ( Ramdya et al . , 2015 ) , proprio - ception at adult leg joints ( Chadha et al . , 2015 ) , and tension sensing in the hindgut of larvae ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . NOMPC forms functional mechanotransduction channels in heterologous expression systems ( Gong et al . , 2013 ; Yan et al . , 2013 ) , thus facilitating structure - function studies of its mechanosensitivity ( Zanini and Go¨pfert , 2013 ) . These favorable features of NOMPC provide an opportunity to test the involvement of ARs , possibly functioning as a tether , in mechanotransduction . In this study , we tested NOMPC mutants with various deletion or duplication of ARs and found that the integrity of 29 ARs is important for mechanogating of NOMPC in expression systems in vitro and in touch receptor neurons in vivo , since only NOMPC constructs with one or two complete sets of 29 ARs are mecha - nosensitive and effective in mediating touch - induced larval behavior . Having found that ARs associate with microtubules and doubling the ARs of NOMPC in mechanosensory cam - paniform sensilla results in lengthening of the membrane - micro - tubule connectors , we further showed that microtubule associa - tion is essential for NOMPC mechanosensitivity . To test whether ARs could confer mechanosensitivity , we transferred ARs from NOMPC to the voltage - gated potassium channel Kv1 . 2 and Kv2 . 1 that normally show little or no mechanosensitivity and found that the chimeric channels respond to mechanical force with dose - dependent activation beyond the level achievable with depolarization . These ﬁndings provide strong evidence for the ability of ARs to mediate mechanosensitivity by func - tioning as a tether linking the channel and the microtubules and thus provide a precedent for the tether mechanism of mechanogating . RESULTS The Ankyrin Repeats Are a Cytoplasmic Domain of NOMPC To investigate the function of ARs in the N terminus of NOMPC , we ﬁrst assessed its localization relative to the cell membrane . Topological modeling indicated that NOMPC bears either 6 or 7 trans - membrane segments ( Figure S1 ) . To elucidate the topology of NOMPC , we employed antibodies recognizing different regions of NOMPC protein for immunostaining of cells in either permeabilized or non - permeabilized conditions . Sur - face expression of NOMPC in transfected S2 cells was con - ﬁrmed with an antibody against an extracellular epitope in the putative pore region of NOMPC ( a NOMPC - EC ; Figure 1A ) , which recognized NOMPC in the plasma membrane in the non - permeabilized condition ( Figure 1B ; Movie S1 ) . We found that both the N terminus and the C terminus of NOMPC are on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane , since antibodies against the N terminus of NOMPC ( a NOMPC - N - ter ; Figure 1A ) ( Liang et al . , 2011 ) or the C terminus of NOMPC ( a NOMPC - C - ter ; Figure 1A ) ( Cheng et al . , 2010 ) immunostained permeabi - lized , but not non - permeabilized , cells ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . These results suggest a topology of NOMPC with six trans - membrane helices and intracellular N and C termini ( Figure 1A ) , which is typical of TRP channels ( Venkatachalam and Montell , 2007 ) . AR Structure Is Essential for NOMPC Surface Expression Immunostaining of NOMPC on the cell membrane with antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain of NOMPC ( a NOMPC - EC ) revealed that deleting all 29 ARs of NOMPC abolished surface expression ( Figure 1E ) . To study the differential roles of ARs , we generated truncated NOMPC channels with different numbers of ARs . D 1 - 12 ARs , which contains a total of 17 ARs , was con - structed to resemble the cold - sensitive TRPA1 channels that contain 14 – 18 ARs in their N terminus ( Julius , 2013 ; Paulsen et al . , 2015 ) . Through molecular dynamics simulations using crys - tallographic structures , Sotomayor et al . ( 2005b ) showed that proteins containing 12 and 17 ARs could both respond to small forces by changing the curvature of ARs ( Sotomayor and Schul - ten , 2007 ) . D 13 - 29ARs ( which contains the ﬁrst 12 ARs ) was con - structed to test if there is a difference between these two blocks of ARs . NOMPC channel surface expression was abolished when the last 17 ARs ( D 13 - 29ARs - NOMPC ) or the last 14 ARs ( D 16 – 29ARs - NOMPC ) were deleted ( Figures 1F and 1G ) . In contrast , deleting the ﬁrst 12 ARs led to greater surface expres - sion of NOMPC ( D 1 - 12ARs - NOMPC ) and a higher open probabil - ity ( Figures 1H , S2A , and S2B ) , whereas swapping the ﬁrst 12 ARs and the last 17 ARs of NOMPC abolished surface expression ( Figure 1I ) . Duplicating the ARs in NOMPC ( 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC ) was compatible with surface expression ( Figure 1J ) , as was the addition of 17 ARs inserted near the ﬁrst trans - membrane segment ( TM1 ) of NOMPC ( 29 + 17ARs - NOMPC ) ( Figure 1K ) . It appears that most of the ARs , especially those preceding the trans - membrane segments , are required for NOMPC protein folding , assembly , or membrane targeting . Furthermore , only those mutant and wild - type ( WT ) NOMPC proteins that displayed surface expression exhibited spontaneous channel activity ( Fig - ures 1D – 1K ) . The Integrity of ARs Is Required for Mechanotransduction by NOMPC Channels The ARs of NOMPC have been proposed to mediate the gating of mechanotransduction channels ( Howard and Bechstedt , 2004 ; Sotomayor et al . , 2005a ) . To test this possibility , we re - corded from outside - out patches excised from transfected S2 cells and stimulated the membrane patches that were held at a speciﬁc voltage level with brief negative pressure ( 50 mmHg ) applied via a high speed pressure clamp . Among those mutant NOMPC channels with membrane ex - pression , only NOMPC with duplicated ARs ( 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC ) exhibited mechanogating ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Whereas current amplitude normalized to patch membrane area as determined by membrane capacitance suggested the current mediated by wild - type NOMPC was larger than that mediated by NOMPC with duplicated ARs ( Figure 2C , red bars ) , normalizing the mecha - nosensitive current amplitude by the level of surface expression revealed that the mechanosensitive current response of NOMPC with duplicated ARs was comparable to that of wild - type NOMPC ( Figure 2C , black bars ) . In contrast , deforming the membrane with the same pressure did not evoke responses of mutant D 1 - 12ARs - NOMPC or 29 + 17ARs - NOMPC ( Figures 2A – 2C ) , even though both proteins exhibited surface expression and spontaneous channel activities . The spontaneous channel activities were likely 1392 Cell 162 , 1391 – 1403 , September 10 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . from NOMPC channels , since they showed similar single channel conductance ( Figure S2B ) and could be blocked with the same channel blocker Gd 3 + ( Figure S2C ) . Similar results were obtained when the S2 cells were stimu - lated with a piezo - actuator and the responses were recorded at the whole - cell conﬁguration ( Figure 2D ) . The amplitude of these mechanogated currents depended on the strength of mechanical stimulation ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . Notably , the D 1 - 12ARs - NOMPC exhibited a larger open probability than wild - type NOMPC in the absence of mechanical stimulation ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Thus , the integrity of the structure of 29 ARs from NOMPC is essential for mechanogating , possibly by forming a full turn of a helix for force transduction ( Howard and Bechstedt , 2004 ) . The requirement of all 29 ARs for NOMPC mechanogating might also explain why the number of ARs ( 29 ) is conserved across NOMPC homologs in ﬂy , nem - atodes , zebraﬁsh , and frogs ( Kang et al . , 2010 ; Sidi et al . , 2003 ) .

To study the functional role of NOMPC ARs in these mechanosensory neurons , we tested whether NOMPC channels with different numbers of ARs driven by a class III da neuron - speciﬁc Gal4 driver ( 19 - 12 - Gal4 ) can functionally rescue touch sensitivity in the nompC - null mutant background . The GFP - tagged mutant NOMPC channels showed expression throughout the den - dritic arborizations of the neurons , similar to that of wild - type NOMPC ( Figure 3A ) . Non - permeabilized immunostaining of larval neurons revealed that both wild - type and 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC could be trafﬁcked to the plasma membrane of den - drites . However , the expression level of 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC in class III da neurons was lower than that of wild - type NOMPC ( Figures S3A and S3B ) , similar to what was observed in heterologous cells ( Figures 1J ) . A single touch displacing the body wall by 20 m m triggered the ﬁring of multiple action po - tentials of class III da neurons in wild - type , but not in nompC mutant , larvae ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . Expression in class III da neurons of wild - type NOMPC or NOMPC with duplicated ARs ( 29 + 29ARs ) , but not of NOMPC with 29 + 17ARs , D 1 - 29ARs , or D 1 - 12ARs , rescued the mutant phenotype on touch - evoked response ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . The partial rescue of NOMPC with 29 + 29ARs might be due to a lower expression level ( Fig - ures S3A and S3B ) . Together with our in vitro results shown in Figure 2 , these ﬁndings illustrate that the integrity of the 29 ARs is essential for the mechanosensory function of NOMPC channels in vivo and the ability of class III da neurons to respond to gentle touch . NOMPC - Mediated Larval Touch Sensation Requires ARs Drosophila third - instar larvae show stereotyped behavioral re - sponses to gentle touch that are mediated by the class III da neurons ( Tsubouchi et al . , 2012 ; Yan et al . , 2013 ) . Compared to the gentle touch response of wild - type controls , nompC - null mutant larvae displayed a greatly reduced touch response ( Figure 3D ) . Expressing wild - type NOMPC , but not NOMPC channels with D 1 - 29ARs , D 1 - 12ARs , or 29 + 17ARs , in the class III da neurons of nompC - null mutants restored their touch sensitivity ( Figure 3D ) . NOMPC channels with 29 + 29ARs could partially rescue touch sensation ( Figure 3D ) , in accord with their lower capability of inducing mechanosensitive responses in S2 cells and class III da neurons ( Figures 2E , 2F , and 3C ) . Thus , in addition to being essential for NOMPC mechanogating and mechanically evoked neuronal response of sensory neu - rons , NOMPC ARs are required for behavioral responses to touch stimuli . ARs Are an Essential Component for Membrane - Microtubule Connectors Mechanosensory campaniform sensilla in the Drosophila haltere bear ﬁlamentous connections between the plasma membrane and the microtubule cytoskeleton , known as membrane - micro - tubule connectors ( MMCs ) . These MMCs have been suggested A D E F B C Figure 2 .

This raises the prospect that ARs might anchor to the microtubules and play a role in me - chanical transduction ( Zanini and Go¨pfert , 2013 ) . Because of the favorable anatomy of campaniform sensilla in the Drosophila haltere , whose dendritic tips are packed with NOMPC and whose MMCs are arranged in a regular array that can be dis - cerned with EM ( Figure 4A ) , we used these sensory organs to test whether the ARs of NOMPC might be visualized as a tether . Consistent with previous observations ( Liang et al . , 2013 ) , we found that MMCs were indeed present in wild - type ﬂies ( ‘‘NOMPC + ’’ ) but virtually lost in nompC 1 - null mutants ( ‘‘NOMPC (cid:1) ’’ ) ( Figures 4A – 4C and S4 ) . In nompC 1 mutants , the MMCs were restored by expressing 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC in the receptors via nompC - GAL4 , indicating that 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC integrates properly with its duplicated ARs domain binding microtubules ( Figures 4A – 4C and S4 ) .

MMCs ( mean MMC length ± SD : 18 ± 5 nm [ NOMPC 29 + 29ARs ] versus 15 ± 5 nm [ NOMPC + ] ) ( Figures 4D and S4 ) and a larger spacing between the membrane and the microtubule ( mean distance ± SD : 15 ± 4 nm [ NOMPC 29 + 29ARs ] versus 12 ± 4 nm [ NOMPC + ] ) ( Figure 4D ) . A priori , we had not expected that replacing wild - type NOMPC with 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC would cause such ultrastructural ef - fects ; loss of NOMPC protein reportedly leaves the microtu - bule - membrane distance largely unaffected ( Liang et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that the MMCs adjust their tension to ﬁt into this pre - set distance ( Zanini and Go¨pfert , 2013 ) . However , when we systematically analyzed the membrane - microtubule distance in NOMPC + and NOMPC (cid:1) ﬂies , we found that this distance was slightly , yet signiﬁcantly , larger in nompC - null mutants ( mean distance ± SD : 17 ± 5 nm [ NOMPC (cid:1) ] versus 12 ± 4 nm [ NOMPC + ] ) ( Figure 4D ) . It thus appears that the MMCs pull together the membrane and the microtubules , explaining why changes in their spacing and in the MMC length can be dis - cerned when NOMPC is replaced with 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC . In ﬂies expressing 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC , the distribution of microtu - bule - membrane distances were signiﬁcantly different from those observed in NOMPC + and NOMPC (cid:1) ﬂies ( Figure 4D ) , assuming intermediate values .

Double immune - labeling of NOMPC and microtubules revealed co - localization of NOMPC and microtubules in trans - fected S2 cells , especially in areas near the cell surface ( Fig - ure 5A ) . Staining of non - permeabilized cells with NOMPC anti - body ( a NOMPC - EC ) further revealed that NOMPC channels on the plasma membrane co - localized with microtubules ( Fig - ure 5B ) . Furthermore , TIRF ( total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ) microscopy imaging of the non - permeabilized staining is consis - tent with the notion that surface NOMPC channels interact with cortical microtubules in the vicinity of the membrane ( Figures 5C and S5A ) . NOMPC expression in S2 cells did not alter the microtubule distribution ( Figure S5B ) . To test whether NOMPC proteins bind to microtubules , we carried out the co - sedimenta - tion assay . We found that wild - type NOMPC proteins from lysate of cells transfected with NOMPC associate with microtubules ( Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , afﬁnity - puriﬁed NOMPC proteins ( Fig - ure S5C ) also interacted strongly with microtubules ( Figure 5D ) , indicating that NOMPC channels may bind to microtubules in cells . In light of a recent report implicating interactions between TRPV1 channels and microtubules in osmotically induced cell shrinkage ( Prager - Khoutorsky et al . , 2014 ) , we tested whether microtubules are required for mechanogating of NOMPC . Applying 100 nM of the microtubule - depolymerizing drug noco - dazole ( Vasquez et al . , 1997 ) to the cytoplasmic side of the S2 cell membrane in inside - out patches drastically reduced the NOMPC current response to mechanical stimuli , shortly after the onset of nocodazole infusion ( Figure 5E ) . Nocodazole also had a similar effect when tested in the cell - attached mode ( Fig - ures 5F and 5G ) . Nocodazole treatment had no effect on NOMPC expression levels in the plasma membrane as revealed by NOMPC surface staining ( Figures S5D and S5E ) . Nocodazole speciﬁcally reduced the NOMPC mechanogated current without affecting the voltage gating of Kv1 . 2 and Kv2 . 1 channels ( Figures A D B C Figure 4 .

A chemically unrelated microtubule - depolymerizing drug colcemid had a similar effect on NOMPC channel gating , whereas enhancing microtubule polymerization with paclitaxel did not interfere with NOMPC activity ( Figure 5H ) , further indi - cating that microtubules are essential for NOMPC mechanogat - ing . In contrast , either stabilizing or disrupting the actin cytoskel - eton had no effect on NOMPC mechanogating ( Figure 5I ) . These ﬁndings indicate that NOMPC mechanosensitivity critically de - pends on the integrity of microtubules . ARs Transferred from NOMPC to Kv Channels Confer Mechanosensitivity Lastly , we tested if transferring the ARs from NOMPC to other ion channels could confer mechanosensitivity . We ﬁrst chose as a recipient the mouse Kv1 . 2 voltage - gated potassium channel with a structure ( Long et al . , 2005 ) bearing architectural similarity with that of TRP channels ( Kalia and Swartz , 2013 ) . We con - structedachimericproteinbyfusingtheNOMPCN - terminalcyto - solic domain , includingthe29ARs ( M1 - S1268fromNOMPC ) with the Kv1 . 2 transmembrane ( TM ) domain and C terminus ( G160 - V499 from Kv1 . 2 ) ( S1268 - G160 - Kv1 . 2 chimera ) ( Figure 6A ) . To test if mechanical stimuli gate this chimeric channel , we applied 50 mmHg pressure to outside - out patches obtained from trans - fected S2 cells . Mechanically evoked currents were detected in K + , but not Cs + , containing intracellular solutions , when the mem - brane potential was held at + 60 mV ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . By contrast , no mechanosensitivecurrent wasdetectablein patches with wild - type Kv1 . 2 or Kv1 . 2 without its N - terminal cytosolic domain ( Kv1 . 2 D Nterminus ) ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . Our experiments further revealed that the pre - S1 linker of NOMPC is important for mechanotransduction since a chimeric channel containing the NOMPC ARs , but not this linker ( M1 - M1120 from NOMPC ) and the Kv1 . 2 TM domain and C terminus ( G160 - V499 from Kv1 . 2 ) ( M1120 - G160 - Kv1 . 2 chimera ) , was not mechanosensitive ( Fig - ures 6B and 6C ) . To corroborate that the mechanosensitive current indeed originated from the S1268 - G160 - Kv1 . 2 chimera , we tested the speciﬁc Kv1 . 2 channel blocker maurotoxin ( MTX ) ( Kharratetal . , 1997 ) , whichblockedthemechanosensitivecurrent of the chimeric channel ( Figure 6D ) , while having no effect on NOMPC channel activity ( Figures S6A and S6B ) . Kv1 . 2 was reported to be slightly mechanosensitive when stimulated with a piezo actuator ( Hao et al . , 2013 ) , even though it was not mechanosensitive in our assay system ( Figures 6B and 6C ) .

Again , the chimeric channel ( S1268 - V182 - Kv2 . 1 chimera ) exhibited mechanosensitivity similar to that of ARs - Kv1 . 2 chi - meric channels , whereas wild - type Kv2 . 1 , Kv2 . 1 lacking the N - terminal cytosolic domain ( Kv2 . 1 D Nterminus ) , and a chimeric channel containing the NOMPC ARs , but not the linker and the Kv2 . 1 TM domain and C terminus ( M1120 - G182 - Kv2 . 1 chimera ) , were not mechanosensitive ( Figures 6E and 6F ) . Chimeric Channels Share Similar Gating Mechanisms with NOMPC Dose - dependent responses to mechanical stimuli and adap - tation to prolonged mechanical stimulation are hallmarks of mechanosensitivity . Both chimeric channels showed dose - dependent responses when stimulated with different levels of pressure applied to the membrane , similar to that of NOMPC channels . The current amplitudes increased progressively with the pressure intensity ( Figures 7A and S7A ) . The chimeric chan - nels appeared to exhibit lower current amplitude to pressure as compared to wild - type NOMPC ( Figures 2E , 7B , and S7B ) . Me - chanosensitive currents from the S1268 - G160 - Kv1 . 2 chimera exhibited adaptation in response to maintained pressure stimu - lation ( Figure 7C ) . Next , we wanted to know whether the mechanosensitive cur - rents of the chimeric channels depend on their interacting with microtubules . Similar to NOMPC channels , the chimeric chan - nels exhibited microtubule interaction , which was more promi - nent than that of wild - type Kv channels ( Figures 7E and S7C ) . The mechanogated current from ARs - Kv1 . 2 chimeric channels also depended on microtubule integrity , since disrupting micro - tubules with nocodazole largely abolished the mechanical response of the chimeric channels ( Figure 7D ) , while leaving voltage - gating of wild - type Kv1 . 2 channels unaffected ( Figures S5F and S5G ) . These experiments provide further support that ARs are part of a tether that links the channels with microtubules . Without the Kv1 . 2 or Kv2 . 1 N terminus that includes the T1 tetramerization domain , the chimeric channels yielded smaller currents , and the voltage dependence of the normalized current ( I / I max ) was shifted to the right for both Kv1 . 2 ( Figures 7F – 7H ) and Kv2 . 1 ( Figures 7I – 7K ) . By applying a 50 mmHg pressure pulse to patches with ARs - Kv chimeric channels during each membrane depolarization step , we normalized the current at the plateau phase near the end of the depolarization , as well as the current during the pressure pulse to the current induced by depolariza - tion to + 100 mV ( I max ) ( Figures 7H and 7K ) . This revealed a syn - ergistic action of voltage gating and mechanogating . Mechanical stimulation shifted the I - V curve of ARs - Kv channels to the left , while having no effect on wild - type Kv channels at any voltage tested , leaving the V 1 / 2 unchanged , which was 12 . 1 mV for Kv1 . 2 ( Figure 7H ) and 28 mV for Kv2 . 1 ( Figure 7K ) . It thus ap - pears that transferring the ARs of NOMPC confers mechanosen - sitivity to the chimeric channel containing the voltage sensor and the pore of Kv1 . 2 or Kv2 . 1 , by allowing the chimeric channels to respond to mechanical force and activate to a greater extent than what could be achieved by depolarization . DISCUSSION Inthisstudy , wehaveprovidedevidencethatARsare essentialfor NOMPC mechanogating . We further show that mechanogating of NOMPC requires the integrity of microtubules associated to the plasma membrane , providing a precedent for a tethered mecha - nismformechanotransductionchannelactivation . ThattheARsof NOMPC can render voltage - gated potassium channels mecha - nosensitive highlights their functional sufﬁciency for mechanogat - ing for those normally mechanoinsensitive channels . The Components of MMCs Documenting that duplicating the NOMPC ARs elongates the MMCs , our analysis supports previous indications ( Liang et al . , 2013 ) that the ARs are the main components of the MMCs . Based on our analysis , duplicating the ARs elongates the MMCs by ca . 20 % , but does not duplicate their length . Possibly , the length increase is underestimated when being assayed only in a two - dimensional plane , and adjacent Ankyrins might also have moved closer together , which cannot be resolved by elec - tron - microscopy . Alternatively , it seems likely that the MMC length is constrained by the membrane - microtubule distance , and that the MMCs are ﬁt into this pre - set distance by adjusting their tension rather than their length . Measured membrane - microtubule distances are larger for NOMPC - than for NOMPC + ﬂies , suggesting that the membrane and the microtubules are pulled together by the MMCs . Upon duplication of the ARs , the membrane - microtubule distance assumes intermediate values in between those of NOMPC (cid:1) and NOMPC + ﬂies , pointing to a reduced pull by—and a reduced stiffness of—the MMCs . Hence , although the membrane - microtubule distance remains largely unaltered when NOMPC is lost ( Liang et al . , 2013 ) , the slight change that shows up when large numbers of sensilla are analyzed explains why we detected the MMC elongation that arises when NOMPC is replaced by 29 + 29ARs - NOMPC . The Regulation of NOMPC Gating by Other Cellular Components Heterologous expression of NOMPC in S2 cells is sufﬁcient to generate mechanosensitive channels . However , NOMPC chan - nels and their homologs serve multiple functions in different mechanosensors ( Chadha et al . , 2015 ; Effertz et al . , 2011 ; Kang et al . , 2010 ; Lehnert et al . , 2013 ; Ramdya et al . , 2015 ; Sidi et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) , and their functions may be regulated differently in different cell types . It is conceivable that in different mechanosensors , NOMPC interacts with different sets of molecules that regulate channel opening in vivo , a possibility that warrants future inves - tigation for better understanding of the mechanical gating machinery . Notably , Ankyrin domain is a motif for mediating pro - tein - protein interactions in various biological processes , raising the possibility that other proteins bind to ARs to regulate NOMPC channel functions . Our current ﬁndings support a tether model , in which NOMPC channels dock to intracellular cytoskeleton via their ARs that form the gating tethers . There are two different versions of the tether model : ( 1 ) an intracellular tether model and ( 2 ) a model involving both intracellular and extracellular tethers ( Lumpkin Cell 162 , 1391 – 1403 , September 10 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 1399 A B E C F I J K G H D Figure 7 .

See also Figure S7 . 1400 Cell 162 , 1391 – 1403 , September 10 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . and Caterina , 2007 ) . In this study , we have provided strong evi - dence that ARs serve as an intracellular tether . It remains an open question whether there are any extracellular partners of NOMPC channels involved in their gating , either with direct or in - direct interactions . NOMPA , a protein identiﬁed in the same ge - netic screen ( Kernan et al . , 1994 ) that also led to the discovery of NOMPC , is required for the normal development of chordotonal neurons in ﬂy hearing organs ( Boekhoff - Falk , 2005 ) . Immuno - staining of ﬂy Johnston organs has shown that NOMPA localizes at the tip of chordotonal neurons and might play a role in docking the dendritic tips to their supporting cells ( Chung et al . , 2001 ) . Further experiments would be needed to test whether NOMPC interacts with NOMPA or other proteins in the mechanosensory organs . The Transformation of Mechanical Forces to Protein Dynamics Our ﬁnding that ARs from NOMPC can gate chimeric Kv chan - nels with their N termini replaced by these ARs , set the stage to create mechanotransduction channels / machineries by pro - tein engineering . Compared to the chimeric channels , NOMPC is more susceptible to forces conveyed by ARs , raising the possibility that the trans - membrane domain of NOMPC is more amenable to mechanogating . We wish to emphasize that while our results strongly support the notion that ARs function as a tether for mechanogating of NOMPC , our results do not exclude the potential role of interactions between NOMPC protein and the membrane lipids nearby . Structural information of the NOMPC channel will be valuable for future investigation of force transmission and force - displacement conversion within a mechanotransduction channel protein , as well as the potential roles of the lipid molecules in the mem - brane near NOMPC .
