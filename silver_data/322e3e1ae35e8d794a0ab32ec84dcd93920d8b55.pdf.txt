The unique polymerization mechanism of ﬁbrin , which allows control of gelation times and network architecture by variation in reaction conditions , allows formation of a wide array of soft substrates under physiological conditions . Fibrin gels have been extensively studied rheologically in part because their nonlinear elasticity , characterized by soft compliance at small strains and impressive stiffening to resist larger deformations , appears essential for their function as haemostatic plugs and as matrices for cell migration and wound healing . The ﬁlaments forming a ﬁbrin network are among the softest in nature , allowing them to deform to large extents and stiffen but not break . The biochemical and mechanical properties of ﬁbrin have recently been exploited in numerous studies that suggest its potential for applications in medicine and bioengineering . Keywords : ﬁbrin ; gel ; tissue engineering ; extracellular matrix ; elasticity 1 . INTRODUCTION A ﬁbrin network is the ﬁrst scaffold that a cell encounters as it performs its role in healing wounds due to trauma or other insults to normal tissue . Platelets bind and pull on the ﬁbrin strands as soon as they assemble into a network ( Kuntamukkula et al . 1978 ) , neutrophils and macrophages ( Ciano et al . 1986 ) attach to ﬁbrin as they home to sites of injury to dispose of dead tissues and infectious agents that have breached the epidermal barrier , and ﬁbroblasts ﬁrst anchor to ﬁbrin as they enter the wound site to rebuild the tissue ( Brown et al . 1993 ; Laurens et al . 2006 ) . Unlike the extracellular matrices and basement membranes formed by collagen , laminin and proteoglycans , which assemble slowly in an ordered manner dictated by the cells that secrete them , ﬁbrin gels assemble rapidly by a modiﬁed polycondensation reaction ( Janmey 1982 ) from ﬁbrinogen , an abundant constituent of blood plasma , as soon as the protease thrombin is activated in the clotting cascade and begins to remove the part of the ﬁbrinogen polypeptides that prevent its spontaneous polymerization . The result is a three - dimensional network of branching ﬁbres , as shown in ﬁgure 1 , that form hydrogels with large elastic moduli at very low volume fraction of polymer . In contrast to the more permanent extracellular matrices , which are usually formed by the sequential assembly of numerous components in a spatially ordered array that is difﬁcult or impossible to reproduce in vitro , ﬁbrin gels formed from puriﬁed plasma proteins acquire structures and mechanical properties that are very similar to those of the blood clot . Furthermore , the ﬁbrin clot is biodegradable , being removed in a systematic way by the ﬁbrinolytic system ( Weisel 2005 ) . The presence of cells , especially the ones such as platelets that induce internal tensions in the ﬁbrin network ( Cohen et al . 1975 ) , modiﬁes the mechanical properties of blood clots in vivo , but the structures of the ﬁbrin strands and the geometry of the networks they form are similar to those formed in vitro . Although platelets do also affect ﬁbrin structure because their membranes contain ﬁbrin ( ogen ) - binding integrins and enzyme complexes that activate throm - bin , addition of isolated cells that produce internal tensions can reproduce many aspects of the native ﬁbrin gel ( Shah & Janmey 1997 ) . Fibrin networks also speciﬁcally bind numerous proteins resident in normal blood or released into it in response to wounding , and many of these factors , such as ﬁbronectin , growth factors and protease inhibitors , can be added back in vitro and either bind the ﬁbrin network non - covalently J .

The abundance of ﬁbrinogen , the relative ease of its puriﬁcation , the ability to control gelation times by altering thrombin concentrations and the mechanical properties of ﬁbrin gels all have advantages for aspects of wound healing and tissue engineering and have been applied in a wide range of settings ( Weisel & Cederholm - Williams 1997 ; Laurens et al . 2006 ) . The structure of the ﬁbrinogen monomer , the mechanisms of its activation by thrombin and subsequent poly - merization and its interaction with various cell types are relatively well characterized and have been reported in several extensive recent reviews ( Mosesson 2005 ; Weisel 2005 ; Lord 2007 ) . This short review will brieﬂy summarize the aspects of ﬁbrin structure most closely related to its mechanical properties , examine the unique mechanical properties of ﬁbrin that appear to be advantageous for its clinical application and report some recent examples of its potential for both tissue engineering and therapy . 2 . STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF FIBRINOGEN AND ITS POLYMERIZATION Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein 45 nm in length and made up of three pairs of polypeptide chains , ( A a B bg ) 2 , including the ﬁbrinopeptides A and B , held together by 29 disulphide bonds ( Weisel 2005 ) . The amino termini of all six chains are joined in the central region , which is connected to the end domains by a - helical coiled coils . The central region also contains the two pairs of ﬁbrinopeptides ( ﬁgure 2 a ) . The distal end regions comprise the C - terminal g - chains , while the proximal end regions comprise the C - terminal B b - chains . The A a - chains fold back to comprise a fourth strand of the coiled coil and connect to the a C - domains , which bind to the central region . Fibrinogen has three high - afﬁnity binding sites for calcium ions and several lower afﬁnity sites . Fibrin polymerization is initiated by the action of the proteolytic enzyme , thrombin , to cleave the ﬁbrinopeptides from the middle of ﬁbrinogen to produce ﬁbrin monomer ( Weisel 2005 ) . Thrombin , which is generated by the clotting cascade from prothrombin , cleaves at speciﬁc Arg - Gly residues , with the A ﬁbrinopeptides being cleaved more rapidly than the B ﬁbrinopeptides . Cleavage of the A ﬁbrinopeptides exposes knobs ‘A’ that are complementary to holes ‘a’ that are always exposed near the ends of the molecule in the g C - module , as shown schematically in ﬁgure 2 b . There are also knobs ‘B’ exposed by the removal of the B ﬁbrinopeptides that are complementary to holes ‘b’ in the b C - module . Speciﬁc interactions between knobs ‘A’ and holes ‘a’ yield protoﬁbrils in which the ﬁbrin monomers are half - staggered , since the central region of one molecule binds to the end of an adjacent molecule ( ﬁgure 2 c ) . B ﬁbrinopeptide cleavage occurs primarily from ﬁbrin oligomers and enhances lateral aggregation , such that the clots made up of thicker ﬁbres are produced with the cleavage of both ﬁbrinopeptides rather than from the removal of the A peptides only . The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of B ﬁbrinopeptide removal are not well understood , but may include B – b interactions , release of the a C - domains and binding interactions of the B peptides ( Weisel 2007 b ) . These initial oligomers lengthen with the addition of more monomers to make two - stranded protoﬁbrils , which aggregate into ﬁbres having a repeat of 22 . 5 nm , half the molecular length of ﬁbrin ( ogen ) . Protoﬁbril assembly occurs by highly speciﬁc protein – protein interactions , and micrometre - long single , semiﬂexible protoﬁbrils of approximately 10 nm diameter are stable at high pH ( 8 . 5 ) and [ NaCl ] ( 0 . 45 M ) ( Janmey & Ferry 1986 ) . Under physiological ionic conditions , protoﬁbrils assemble into ﬁbres by lateral interactions that involve both speciﬁc , relatively weak protein bonds and interactions with chloride ions ( Di Stasio et al . 1998 ) . Gels can be formed by either protoﬁbrils or ﬁbres , to make so - called ﬁne and coarse clots , respectively ( Ferry & Morrison 1947 ) . Lateral growth of ﬁbres appears to be limited because protoﬁbrils are twisted and the interactions in lateral aggregation are speciﬁc , so that , as the ﬁbre diameter is increased , they must be stretched to traverse an increasing path length ( Weisel et al . 1987 ) . With this model , ﬁbre growth ceases when the energy to stretch an added protoﬁbril exceeds the energy of bonding . Fibres branch to make a three - dimensional network , and most branch points are trifunctional , in other words consisting of the junction of three ﬁbres ( Ryan et al . 1999 ) . Branching is generally the opposite of lateral aggregation , in that the conditions that favour lateral aggregation yield clots made of thick ﬁbres with few branch points , whereas the conditions that hinder lateral aggregation yield clots with thin ﬁbres and many branch points . Branching is essential for ﬁbrin to make a space - ﬁlling gel . The properties of clots vary greatly depending on the conditions of polymerization ( Weisel 2007 a ) . The thickness of ﬁbres , the extent of branching and the pore size of clots can vary to a very large extent , depending on a whole host of factors . For example , the thrombin concentration can have dramatic effects on clot structure , with low thrombin yielding clots with thick ﬁbres , few branch points and large pores . Similarly , salt Figure 1 . Scanning electron micrograph of 1 mg l K 1 human ﬁbrinogen polymerized by 1 U ml K 1 thrombin at pH 7 . 4 and 150 mM NaCl .

Interface ( 2009 ) concentration , pH and many plasma proteins affect clot structure and properties . The blood clot is stabilized by the formation of covalent bonds introduced by the plasma transgluta - minase , factor XIIIa , which makes it more stable mechanically and more resistant to proteolytic diges - tion ( Arie¨ns et al . 2002 ; Lorand & Graham 2003 ) . The active enzyme , factor XIIIa , is generated from its precursor , factor XIII , by the action of thrombin in the presence of calcium ions and ﬁbrin . Speciﬁc glutamine and lysine side chains are joined , ﬁrst those near the C - terminal end of the g - chains , yielding primarily g - dimers , followed by others near the C - terminal ends of the a - chains , yielding a whole series of a - polymers . 3 . RHEOLOGICAL FEATURES OF FIBRIN GELS Fibrin is a viscoelastic polymer , with both elastic and viscous properties . Its viscoelastic properties can vary greatly , depending on clot structure and biochemical properties ( Weisel 2004 ) . During polymerization , ﬁnite clot stiffness can ﬁrst be detected when the network is established , at the gel point , and the stiffness increases with time . For small strains over short times , the clots are highly elastic and there is little inelastic component over a wide range of frequencies or rate of application of strain . At higher frequencies of strain , inelastic deformation becomes apparent and increases in magni - tude with the rate of change . Creep in ﬁbrin occurs over very long times and substantial deformation can take place . However , surprisingly for ﬁne clots the recovery of the original stiffness after removal of the initial stress is nearly complete . In other words , apparently there are no net changes in structure during the rearrangements responsible for the creep . 4 . NONLINEAR ELASTICITY OF FIBRIN GELS The elongated , but still compliant , nature of the ﬁbrin strands and the inherent branches ( cross links ) built into the polymerization mechanism produce protein networks with viscoelastic properties that differ in many respects from those of synthetic hydrogels . One of the most interesting rheological properties of ﬁbrin is its nonlinear elasticity . The elastic modulus of ﬁbrin , measured in either shear or elongational strain , strongly increases the more the material is deformed ( strained ) , as shown in ﬁgure 3 . The strain - stiffening nature of blood clots and puriﬁed ﬁbrin gels has been experimentally evident for decades ( Janmey et al . 1983 ) , but theoretical models to explain this effect have only recently been developed . Several different models can account for nonlinear elasticity of elongated ﬁbre networks ( MacKintosh et al . 1995 ; Didonna & Lubensky 2005 ; Onck et al . 2005 ; Storm et al . 2005 ; Heussinger et al . 2007 ; Huisman et al . 2007 ) , and which one applies depends on how ﬂexible the ﬁlaments are , compared with the mesh size of the networks . More precisely , if the persistence length of the ﬁlament is similar to the mesh size of the network , as it is for ﬁne clots , then strain stiffening emerges naturally from an entropic model that considers how the thermal A A B B B B B B B B E - region fibrin monomer fibrinogen D - region D - region D - region D - region D - region D - region E - region E - region a b a b a b a b a b a b A A E - region D - region a b a b D - region two A and two B ‘knobs’ coiled coil coiled coil FpA FpA FpB ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) FpB E - region D - region a b a b D - region - module - module coiled coil coiled coil - module - module - module - module - module - module Figure 2 .

Dynamic shear storage moduli measured with a strain - controlled rheometer at different maximal strain amplitudes are shown for 6 mg ml K 1 human ﬁbrinogen polymerized under coarse clotting conditions ( ﬁlled circles ) , and for 5 % polyacrylamide polymerized with ammonium persulphate and TEMED ( open circles ) by standard methods . Detailed methods are given in Storm et al . ( 2005 ) . Review . Clinical and bioengineering use of ﬁbrin gel P . A . Janmey et al . 3 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2009 ) ﬂuctuations of semiﬂexible polymer are constrained as the end - to - end distance of the ﬁlament between cross - linking points changes when the sample is deformed ( MacKintosh et al . 1995 ; Storm et al . 2005 ) . This entropic model , which assumes no changes in the protein structure until the ﬁlament is pulled nearly straight , accounts very well for the elasticity of networks containing ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils ( ﬁne clots ) , as shown schematically in ﬁgure 4 . Under more physio - logical conditions , ﬁbrin forms thicker bundles containing dozens or hundreds of protoﬁbrils , which appear too straight in light micrographs to exhibit any signiﬁcant thermal ﬂuctuations . Coarse ﬁbrin clots , as well as plasma clots , still strain stiffen , and for this case , alternative mainly enthalpic models , based on the orientation and stretching of the ﬁbres are proposed to account for the nonlinear elasticity observed in the experiment ( Didonna & Lubensky 2005 ; Onck et al . 2005 ; Heussinger et al . 2007 ; Huisman et al . 2007 ) . The basic idea of these models , shown schematically in ﬁgure 4 , is that stiff ﬁbres are easier to bend than to stretch , and therefore as strain increases and the ﬁlaments align more in the strain direction , a transition occurs from bending to stretching modes , which leads to increased stiffness at increased strains . This latter model is essentially enthalpic and predicts that at strains where the samples stiffen , changes in the protein structure can be expected , and indeed a change from a - helical to b - structures is observed for ﬁbrin ﬁbres at large deformation . These structural changes presum - ably involve the helical coils connecting the E - and D - regions ( Brown et al . 2007 ) . Both ﬁne and coarse clots also exhibit negative normal stress under simple shear deformation ( Janmey et al . 2007 ) . This property , which is not observed in conventional synthetic gels , implies that at time scales when water can diffuse out of a clot , a shear defor - mation leads to a downward stress that tends to compress the clot . Such an effect might have relevance to the ways the clots deform under stresses in vivo . The entropic and enthalpic models for nonlinear elasticity predict quantitatively different dependencies of elastic modulus and normal stress on mesh size and strain magnitude , and further studies of ﬁbrin and other biopolymer gels will allow testing of these theories . 5 . RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FILAMENT FLEXIBILITY , BUNDLING AND MACROSCOPIC ELASTIC MODULUS A striking mechanical feature of ﬁbrin ﬁlaments is that , compared with other ﬁlamentous biopolymers , they are very soft . For example , a direct measurement of the stiffness of a 200 nm thick ﬁbrin ﬁbre , consisting of shear force ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . Schematics for two different mechanisms of strain stiffening . ( a ) Semiﬂexible polymers linked at ends in network junctions lose conﬁgurational entropy as their end - to - end distances are increased or decreased from their resting lengths during shear deformation . Filaments with intrinsically nonlinear force elongation relationships resist more strongly when they are stretched more to the limit at which the end - to - end distance equals their contour length . Adapted from MacKintosh et al . ( 1995 ) . ( b ) Stiff ﬁlaments deform initially by bending at small strains and then by stretching at larger strains when their end - to - end vectors align in the shear ﬁeld . In this mode , ﬁbres with linear force – extension relationships produce strain stiffening in networks owing to the geometrical changes as they align in shear . Adapted from Onck et al . ( 2005 ) . 4 Review . Clinical and bioengineering use of ﬁbrin gel P . A . Janmey et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2009 ) the order of 100 ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils , was made by using an optical trap to pull on a latex bead directly attached to a strand within a ﬁbrin network ( Collet et al . 2005 ) . The force required to deform a ﬁlament of measured length spanning two branch points to a measured degree of deﬂection was used to calculate the bending modulus of the ﬁlament , k . Young’s modulus of the ﬁbrin strand , an intensive variable deﬁning the material properties of the strand , can be calculated from the ﬁlament’s bending modulus from the relation - ship EI Z k , where I is the moment of inertia of the cylindrical ﬁlaments ( Z p a 4 / 4 , where a is the radius of the ﬁbre ) . This measurement yields Young’s modulus for ﬁbrin of 1 . 7 MPa , if the ﬁlament is not cross - linked by FXIIIa , and of 14 . 5 MPa , if the ﬁbre is covalently linked by g – g - and a – a - bonds ( Collet et al . 2005 ) . Deformation of ﬁbrin ﬁbres has also been measured by atomic force microscopy , using an elegant system that allows lateral force to be applied to a ﬁlament suspended over a nanofabricated channel . These studies show that an unligated ﬁbrin ﬁbre can be strained 120 per cent without damage , and a ligated ﬁbre can withstand strains of more than 400 per cent without breaking ( Liu et al . 2006 ) . The remarkable softness and resistance to breakage distinguish ﬁbrin ﬁbres from all other characterized biopolymers ( Guthold et al . 2007 ) , and direct comparisons of biopolymer mechanical properties are shown in table 1 . Young’s modulus of a single ﬁbrin protoﬁbril has not yet been directly measured by force – deﬂection studies but can be inferred from its measured persistence length l p , a geometric quantity , derived from electron micro - graphs ofﬁbrin protoﬁbrils ( Janmey & Ferry 1986 ) , that quantiﬁes the distance over which the protoﬁbril’s contour is approximately straight . More precisely , persistence length is deﬁned by the expression h cos q ð s Þi Z e K s = l p ; ð 5 : 1 Þ where h cos q ( s ) i is an ensemble average of the angle q formed by two tangents drawn at distances s along the contour . The persistence length is related to the elastic bending constant of the ﬁlament k by the expression k Z l p = k B T ; ð 5 : 2 Þ where k B T is the thermal energy . The persistence length of ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils is measured to be 500 nm ( Storm et al . 2005 ) , corresponding to Young’s modulus of 4 MPa taking the diameter of a protoﬁbril to be 10 nm . The similarity of Young’s moduli of ﬁbrin proto - ﬁbrils and ﬁbres implies that the bonds holding protoﬁbrils together within a ﬁbre are strong enough to prevent protoﬁbril slippage as a ﬁbre is bent , and suggests that the compliance of the ﬁbre comes from longitudinal stretching due to the ﬂexibility of the superhelical coils formed by the three strands in the regions connecting the central and end domains . Recent studies by atomic force microscopy have shown that stretching and limited unfolding of ﬁbrin monomers occur at lower forces ( Brown et al . 2007 ) than those required to detach a ﬁbrin monomer from the lateral bonds holding it within the protoﬁbril ( Litvinov et al . 2005 ; Brown et al . 2007 ; Chtcheglova et al . 2008 ) . The softness of the ﬁbrin strand ( 1 . 5 to 10 MPa ) is evident by comparison of its Young’s modulus with that of actin ﬁlaments ( 44 MPa ; Blange et al . 1997 ) and microtubules ( 100 – 1000 MPa ; Mizushima - Sugano et al . 1983 ; Gittes et al . 1993 ) . In terms of persistence length , ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils are similar to intermediate ﬁlaments ( l p Z 0 . 2 – 1 m m ) but much more ﬂexible than either F - actin ( l p Z 17 m m ) or microtubules ( l p Z O 1 mM ) ( Wagner et al . 2007 ) . 6 . CURRENT CLINICAL AND BIOENGINEERING USES 6 . 1 . Haemostatic glue and wound repair Fibrin glue is currently being used clinically as an adjunct therapy to stem bleeding and to replace sutures in certain applications ( Weisel & Cederholm - Williams 1997 ; Albala & Lawson 2006 ) . Since the blood comes from a common pool , there is a risk of disease or prion transmission , even though the solutions are carefully processed and screened . To avoid this risk , researchers have developed systems to concentrate autologous ﬁbrin glue from a patient’s serum . Two major limitations of these systems are that the sealant solutions can take several hours to prepare and the patient cannot suffer from any clotting disorders . To ensure that clotting occurs quickly and effec - tively , ﬁbrin glues contain very high amounts of ﬁbrinogen and thrombin , up to 60 mg ml K 1 ﬁbrinogen and 300 IU ml K 1 thrombin after mixing ( Buchta et al . 2004 , 2005 ) . Current clinical uses include mesh ﬁxation for inguinal hernia repair , severed sciatic nerve reattachment , stabilization of microsurgical anasto - moses and skin graft adhesion ( Martins et al . 2005 ; Mittermayr et al . 2006 ; Andree et al . 2008 ) . Using ﬁbrin glue instead of sutures or staples enhances healing , minimizes scarring , eases application and in the case of Table 1 .

Janmey et al . 5 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2009 ) hernia repair lowers the risk of nerve injury and postoperative neuralgia ( Santoro et al . 2007 ) . Fibrin glue has also been shown to be effective in helping to anchor a deep brain stimulation electrode for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease by acting as a protective layer between the dura and the methyl methacrylate bioglue that anchors the upper portion of the electrode to a stabilized titanium plate ( Bjarkam et al . 2007 ) . 6 . 2 . Drug delivery To provide injury repair , it is often desirable to locally deliver tissue - speciﬁc growth factors in a controlled manner . Fibrin is an appealing drug delivery vehicle because it can be injected where it gels in situ , it is degraded naturally and it stimulates the body’s own wound healing response . By modifying the interaction between the growth factor and the ﬁbrin scaffold , it is possible to vary the release proﬁle from hours to weeks . The release rate is dependent upon the growth factor’s initial concentration , diffusion rate and interaction with the matrix . Increasing the ﬁbrinogen concen - tration would reduce the matrix pore size and thus retard the permeation of large solutes ; however , increasing the concentration also retards endothelial cell migration and capillary formation ( Nehls & Herrmann 1996 ; Nehls et al . 1998 ; Bhang et al . 2007 ) . Most strategies to regulate growth factor release from ﬁbrin involve modulating the interaction between the gel and the signalling protein . Some proteins such as basic ﬁbroblast growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor , connective tissue growth factor and heparin reversibly bind ﬁbrin with a known K D ( Odrljin et al . 1996 ; Sahni et al . 1998 ; Sahni & Francis 2000 ; Yoshida & Munakata 2007 ) . Heparin can act as a linker between the ﬁbrin network and the growth factors that do not interact with ﬁbrin but do bind heparin such as nerve growth factor and neurotrophin - 3 ( Lobb et al . 1986 ; Taylor & Sakiyama - Elbert 2006 ) . To achieve more controlled release , one group used a phage display assay to identify peptides with a high binding coefﬁcient for nerve growth factor and linked them to a transglutaminase substrate domain , which factor XIIIa then covalently incorporated into the polymerizing ﬁbrin ( Willerth et al . 2007 ) . To synchro - nize bone morphogenic protein - 2 ( BMP - 2 ) release with gel degradation , Schmoekel et al . designed a fusion protein of BMP - 2 , a plasmin cleavage domain and a transglutaminase domain ( Schmoekel et al . 2005 ) . Since growth factor release is now dependent upon the presence of plasmin and surface availability of the ﬁbres , the initial burst release seen in diffusion - limited release is damped . In an interesting reversal , one study used ﬁbrin glue as a perfusion barrier to protect the spinal canal and nerve root from bone ingrowth stimulated by the application of recombinant human BMP - 2 to facilitate spinal disc fusion ( Patel et al . 2006 ) . These methods allow researchers to design a release proﬁle that ﬁts the particular need rather than rely on nature’s limitations . 6 . 3 . Cell delivery Growth factor delivery is sufﬁcient only if there are cells in the injury area capable of responding to the signals . When defects exceed a critical size , the local cell population is not sufﬁcient to repair the injury and additional cells must be introduced . This is another application where ﬁbrin has proven useful . Keratino - cytes suspended in ﬁbrin were effective in reconstitut - ing full thickness wounds in both mouse and human subjects , while skin ﬁbroblast - coated ﬁbrin microbeads decreased the time for granulation tissue formation ( Horch et al . 1998 , 2001 ; Gorodetsky et al . 1999 ) . By layering a ﬁlm of keratinocytes suspended in plasma on top of a layer of suspended ﬁbroblasts , a ﬁbrin - based bilayer skin equivalent was developed , which when grafted onto a mouse skin defect resulted in successful integration with the surrounding skin and a mature dermal – epidermal junction ( Mazlyzam et al . 2007 ) . In plastic surgery , fat tissue transplantation is often required to create the desired look but this process can result in donor site deformity and also a gradual resorption of the transplanted tissue . Preadipocyte - seeded ﬁbrin has been investigated as a possible alternative to autologous tissue transplantation , and in mice has resulted in the formation of stable adipose tissue ( Torio - Padron et al . 2007 ) . An experiment of particular interest showed that injecting skeletal myoblasts in a ﬁbrin scaffold into infarct regions of a live rat heart that had been occluded for 17 min before 7 days improved cell survival and reduced the infarct scar ( Christman et al . 2004 ) . In this setting , the elastic modulus of the scaffold may be of particular signi - ﬁcance since myocyte development does not proceed normally on materials with abnormally high stiffness ( Engler et al . 2004 ) . 6 . 4 . Cell differentiation and tissue engineering Unlike a synthetic hydrogel , ﬁbrin is not just a passive cell delivery matrix , but it binds speciﬁcally many growth factors as well as clot components , such as ﬁbronectin , hyaluronic acid and von Willebrand factor ( Weisel 2005 ) . Fibrin has two pairs of RGD sites and a pair of AGDV sites through which it can interact with integrins and has several sites that interact with the leucocyte integrin a m b 2 ( Cheresh et al . 1989 ; Altieri et al . 1990 ; Lishko et al . 2002 ; Chernousov & Carey 2003 ) . Once ﬁbrinopeptide B has been cleaved by thrombin to reveal b 15 – 42 , endothelial cells can also bind to the network through VE cadherins ( Bach et al . 1998 ) . This bioactivity makes ﬁbrin an attractive matrix for stem cell differentiation and tissue engineering . By modulating the mechanical and chemical properties of a ﬁbrin - based matrix , human mesenchymal stem cells have been differentiated into osteoblasts and mouse embryonic stem cells have been coaxed down neural and astroglial lineages ( Catelas et al . 2006 ; Willerth et al . 2006 ) . Osteogenic differentiation required very high concentrations of ﬁbrinogen and Ca 2 C , whereas neurogenic differentiation required more physiological ﬁbrinogen and Ca 2 C concentrations and preculturing of the embryoid bodies in retinoic acid - containing media . 6 Review . Clinical and bioengineering use of ﬁbrin gel P . A . Janmey et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2009 ) Though ﬁbrin has been effective in vitro at promoting osteogenesis , it lacks the mechanical strength required for bone tissue engineering and in vivo studies have been disappointing even when a stiff scaffold encases the ﬁbrin ( Kneser et al . 2005 ; Arkudas et al . 2007 ) . Fibrin has been more effective as a scaffold for cartilage , cardiovascular and nervous tissue engineering . In cartilage tissue engineering , ﬁbrin promotes glycosami - noglycan and collagen II while inhibiting collagen I deposition by primary or stem cell - derived chondro - cytes ( Dragoo et al . 2007 ; Eyrich et al . 2007 ) . This trend is further enhanced by adding hyaluronic acid to the gel ( Park et al . 2005 ) . To enhance the strength of the ﬁbrin gel , a combination strategy can be employed whereby a highly porous synthetic polymer scaffold with appro - priate mechanical properties is ﬁlled with chondrocytes suspended in a ﬁbrin gel and this whole construct is implanted at the desired junction ( Eyrich et al . 2007 ) . Severed peripheral nerve axons have some capacity to repair themselves but only if the defect is below a certain critical length . Fibrin sealant has been used for promoting nerve repair for a long time ( Young & Medawar 1940 ) . To promote regeneration over longer lengths , channels ﬁlled with stimulatory signals are used to bridge the severed ends . Synthetic polymer channels ﬁlled with ﬁbrin improve nerve repair and this is further enhanced if Schwann cells , which bind ﬁbrin through a v b 8 integrins and are required for healthy axon development , are suspended in the ﬁbrin ( Chernousov & Carey 2003 ; Galla et al . 2004 ; Tsai et al . 2006 ) . In addition to its central role in haemostasis , the ﬁbrin clot also serves as a scaffold for angiogenesis . This makes ﬁbrin uniquely suited for cardiovascular tissue engineering . As with cartilage and nerve regeneration , the best results are achieved when a synthetic scaffold with the desired mechanical properties is combined with a biologically tuned ﬁbrin gel ( Mol et al . 2005 ; Sreerekha & Krishnan 2006 ) . One of the most advanced applications of a ﬁbrin gel in cardiovascular engineering is the development of a moulding system to produce tricuspid heart valve replacements from ﬁbrin , ﬁbro - blasts and smooth muscle myocytes ( Jockenhoevel et al . 2001 ) . Again mechanical properties need to be controlled , and in this case the engineered valves were cultured in a pulsatile ﬂow bioreactor , which resulted in less shrinkage as well as improved alignment of the cells and the ECM components , strengthening the ﬁnal valve ( Flanagan et al . 2007 ) . 6 . 5 . Patterning Most of the techniques described above create chemi - cally and structurally uniform gels , but many tissues are patterned . Growth factor patterning has been achieved in two dimensions by using ink - jet printing to control application of bFGF onto ﬁbrin ﬁlms ( Campbell et al . 2005 ) . Cell adhesion was higher in areas where bFGF was applied , and this difference was maintained over at least 5 days ( Miller et al . 2006 ) . Extension of this printing method to three dimensions would be useful for the production of ﬁbrin bandages or skin equivalents . An increasingly common method to pattern tissue equivalents is by culturing them in a bioreactor . The bioreactors are individually designed to apply physio - logically relevant forces to precondition the implants for their in vivo application . When a constant 25 per cent or greater tensile strain is applied to a 3 mg ml K 1 ﬁbrin gel , the ﬁbril bundles and myoblasts or endo - thelial cells cultured within this gel align and divide along the bundles , forming lines of cells ( Matsumoto et al . 2007 ) . This could prove useful in creating linearly organized tissues but the authors do not describe what happens to the cells when the tensile force is released . Lastly , the grafts can be patterned by orienting the ﬁbrin ﬁbrils as they are polymerizing , which results in an anisotropic structure independent of applied force . This can be done by controlling the initiation sites , polymerizing ﬁbrin under ﬂow or in a high magnetic ﬁeld or by electrospinning the protein on to a rotating target ( Dubey et al . 2001 ; McManus et al . 2006 , 2007 ) . Aligned ﬁbrin has been shown to enhance neurite alignment and could be a useful ﬁller for nerve guidance channels ( Dubey et al . 2001 ) . Electrospinning has the added advantage of being able to design more advanced patterns , such as cross - hatching , by manipulating the electric ﬁeld ( Teo et al . 2006 ) . Control of solution conditions can also control ﬁbre thickness and therefore permeability through the matrix ( Sell et al . 2008 ) . 7 . CONCLUSIONS Although it is one of the most abundant and well - characterized polymers in nature , ﬁbrin continues to reveal fascinating features of self - assembly and soft elasticity , and presents many potential uses both as a haemostatic agent in clinical applications and as a scaffold for tissue engineering . Unlike nearly all native cellular matrices and even many synthetic scaffolds , ﬁbrin is designed to assemble rapidly under physiologi - cal conditions by the activation of the soluble ﬁbrinogen monomer by the proteolytic enzyme thrombin . From a practical perspective , methods to purify gram quan - tities of highly puriﬁed ﬁbrinogen , and correspondingly large amounts of thrombin , from both mammalian and non - mammalian blood plasma have enabled many tests of its potential application in biological settings . The fact that both ﬁbrinogen and thrombin retain activity after lyophilization and prolonged storage at ambient temperatures , sterilization by heat and gamma irradi - ation , and processing by methods such as electrospin - ning is a signiﬁcant advantage over other protein polymers . Potential disadvantages for its use in vivo include the possibility of immune response or infectious disease transmission when using heterologous proteins . Improved methods to inactivate bacteria and viruses and the potential to produce both ﬁbrinogen and thrombin as recombinant proteins secreted into culture by mammalian cell lines may signiﬁcantly improve the safety and effectiveness of ﬁbrin - based materials . As an interface for cells grown on two - dimensional or within three - dimensional matrices , ﬁbrin has unique properties that are not matched by other materials . The ﬁbrin ﬁbre is reported to be the most highly extensible of any ﬁlamentous biopolymer , and can Review . Clinical and bioengineering use of ﬁbrin gel P . A . Janmey et al . 7 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2009 ) resist stretching to more than ﬁve times its resting length without breakage . Even elongational strains greater than 100 per cent are completely recoverable when the stress is released . The high degree of deformation tolerated by the ﬁbrin ﬁbre is accommo - dated in part by very loose packing of monomers and high water content in the ﬁbre and by partially reversible secondary structural transitions within the monomers . The softness and large compliance of the ﬁbrin gel appear to be essential for its efﬁciency as a matrix for cells such as neurons that normally reside in very soft tissues such as brain . Continued study of the combined effects of ﬁbrin network mechanics and the biochemical features of ﬁbrin is likely to lead to many new applications of this venerable biomaterial .
