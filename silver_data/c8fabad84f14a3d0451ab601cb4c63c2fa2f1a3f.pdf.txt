1 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Stochastic expression of a multiple antibiotic resistance activator confers transient resistance in single cells Imane El Meouche , Yik Siu , Mary J . Dunlop 2 SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS Plasmids and Strains The strains used in this study were all derived from E . coli K - 12 MG1655 1 . P marA - cfp To construct the MarA reporter plasmid , cfp was derived from 2 and was tagged with an ssrA tag consisting of TSAANDENYALAA 3 . The TS sequence acts as a linker and the ssrA tag ( underlined ) increases the degradation rate of CFP , providing increased dynamic resolution . We used a copy of the wildtype marRAB promoter and introduced transversion mutations to inactivate the two MarR binding sites . The transversion mutations were derived from 4 , where they are listed as ‚ÄúTV - 14 to - 18‚Äù and ‚ÄúTV + 11 to 15‚Äù . The MarA binding site is shown in italics , the former MarR binding sites are underlined , and the transversion mutations are shown in bold .

We also removed the extraneous copy of lacI and its promoter from the pBbS5k plasmid . This plasmid was transformed into E . coli MG1655 . P marA - cfp Œî marRAB This strain uses the MarA reporter plasmid described above , transformed into E . coli MG1655 Œî marRAB , which is described below . MarA - CFP Translational Fusion To construct the protein fusion of MarA and CFP , we amplified the cfp gene from 2 using the forward primer ATGACTAGCAAAAGAAGC and the reverse primer . CTATTATTTATACAGTTCATCCATG . We inserted a ( Gly 2 - Ser ) 2 linker sequence between the marA and cfp genes 6 . marA was amplified from E . coli MG1655 genomic DNA , starting at the start codon and stopping immediately before the marA stop codon . The translational fusion was cloned into the medium copy ( p15A ) origin vector pBbA5k 5 . This plasmid was transformed into E . coli MG1655 . P lac - cfp MG1655 cfp tagged with an ssrA tag ( as described above ) was cloned in the low - copy ( SC101 ) origin vector pBbS5k 5 . This plasmid was transformed into E . coli MG1655 . 3 Deletion of marRAB Operon and fliC Gene In order to delete the marRAB operon and fliC gene , we used homologous recombination 7 . We generated PCR products using primers with extensions homologous to the regions adjacent to the operon or gene . For the marRAB operon , we used the forward primer : CCAGCGATCTGTTCAATGAAATTATTCCATTGGGTCGCTTAATCCATATG GTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC and the reverse primer : AAGCCCCGAGATGTCGGGGCCAGAACAAACTACATAGCGTGTTGATTATA ATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC . For the fliC gene , we used the forward primer : CCCTGCAGCAGAGACAGAACCTGCTGCGGTACCTGGTTAGCTTTTGCCAA GTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC and the reverse primer : ATGGCACAAGTCATTAATACCAACAGCCTCTCGCTGATCACTCAAAATAA ATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC . These primers were used to amplify a kanamycin resistant gene flanked by FRT regions from pKD13 7 . Bold letters indicate the homologous recombination extensions . We followed the protocol for recombination in 7 using the phage lambda recombinase harbored on the low copy plasmid pSIM6 . After recombination , the resistance marker gene was removed using the pCP20 helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase . To verify the insertion and removal of the resistance gene , we used a reverse primer from the resistance gene , K2 : CGGTGCCCTGAATGAACTGC and a forward primer in the region upstream of the marRAB operon : ATAAGGGGTAAACAAGGATAAA or the fliC gene : CAGGCAATTTGGCGTTGCCG . Reverse primers downstream of the marRAB operon : ACTATTGTTGGATGAACGCT or the fliC gene : CCAATACGTAATCAACGACTTGC were used to verify deletions in the mutant strains . Determining the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 8 of Carbenicillin Overnight cultures of P marA - cfp and MarA - CFP were diluted 1 : 100 in LB medium supplemented with 30 Œºg / ml kanamycin ( and 100 ŒºM IPTG for MarA - CFP ) . Then , the diluted cultures were incubated at 37¬∞C for 8 hours with shaking . The OD 600 of each culture was normalized to start new cultures in the presence of antibiotics . Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations ( 0 to 100 Œºg / ml ) of carbenicillin at 37¬∞C for 20 hours with shaking . The final OD 600 was then determined and cell growth was considered inhibited if the final OD 600 measured was lower then 0 . 1 . Determining the Half - life of MarA - CFP MarA - CFP overnight cultures were diluted 1 : 100 in 30 ml LB medium supplemented with 30 Œºg / ml kanamycin and 100 ŒºM IPTG . Expression was induced for 4 hours and then chloramphenicol ( 100 Œºg / ml ) was added to the cultures to stop protein synthesis . 1 ml of the culture was collected and transferred at different time points ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , and 60 mins ) . In order to extract total proteins , cells were harvested at 13 , 000 rpm for 3 mins and 4 the supernatant was removed . The cell pellets were resuspended with 4 % SDS and shaken for 15 mins at 37¬∞C . Glass beads ( 0 . 1 mm ) were added and samples were vortexed for 10 sec and incubated on ice for 10 sec three times . The samples were then centrifuged and the supernatant containing the total proteins was collected . Proteins were then normalized using the Pierce 660nm Protein Assay Reagent ( Fisher ) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations . After separation by SDS - PAGE , proteins were electroblotted ( Bio - Rad ) onto Hybond - enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) nitrocellulose membranes ( Fisher ) . Membranes were probed first with 1 : 3000 rabbit anti - MarA antibodies generously provided by Valerie Duval , Laura McMurry , and Stuart Levy 9 . Primary antibodies were detected using the secondary Peroxidase - AffiniPure Goat Anti - Rabbit IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Immunodetection of proteins was performed with the SuperSignal West Femto Kit ( Fisher ) according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations . Blots were scanned using the VersaDoc 4000 MP ( Bio - Rad ) . Microfluidic Experiment For these experiments we used the strain E . coli MG1655 Œî fliC transformed with the plasmid described in P marA - cfp above . The fliC deletion renders the strain non - motile , which we found to be essential for conducting experiments using microfluidic chips ( motile cells swim out of the trapping chambers ) . The fliC deletion had no impact on the minimum inhibitory concentration of carbenicillin in our conditions . An overnight culture of P marA - cfp Œî fliC was diluted 1 : 1000 in 50 ml LB medium with 30 Œºg / ml kanamycin . When the OD 600 reached 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 , cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2700 x g for 10 mins and resuspended in 1 ml LB medium with 0 . 075 % Tween 80 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 30 Œºg / ml kanamycin . The resuspended cells were introduced into the microfluidic device through the cell port , as described in 10 . Once cells were trapped inside the chamber , fresh LB medium with 0 . 075 % Tween 80 and 30 Œºg / ml kanamycin was flushed through the media channels outside the cell - trapping chambers to supply cells with continuous nutrients . After cells grew to fill the chambers ( approximately 4 hours ) , we began imaging . We denote this time t = 0 mins . The first carbenicillin step was introduced at t = 30 mins , then removed at t = 120 mins . The second step was introduced at t = 670 mins and lasted until the end of the experiment . The addition and removal of carbenicillin was achieved by switching the positions of the syringe media reservoirs on the syringe tower ( Quantitative BioSciences , Inc . and described in 10 ) , in which one of the syringes contained LB medium with 0 . 075 % Tween 80 and 30 Œºg / ml kanamycin while the other contained LB medium with 0 . 075 % Tween 80 , 30 Œºg / ml kanamycin , 50 Œºg / ml carbenicillin , and 10 Œºg / ml propidium iodide . Phase contrast , CFP , and RFP images were taken every 3 minutes for the duration of the experiment . Microfluidic Device Fabrication We obtained the silicon wafer used for microfluidic device fabrication from Quantitative BioSciences , Inc . with feature design published previously 10 , 11 . The device was built using standard soft lithography methods 10 . First , polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) was made by mixing the base and curing agent of the Ellsworth Sygard 184 Silicone Kit ( Fisher ) in a ratio of 10 : 1 . Then , the PDMS was degassed inside a desiccator connected to a vacuum pump . The degassed PDMS was then poured onto the silicon wafer followed by an extra 5 degassing step to remove the air bubbles formed during pouring . Next , the PDMS was incubated at 75¬∞C for 2 hours and was subsequently removed from the wafer . Individual PDMS devices were cut out using a razor blade . Each port of the device was made accessible to the connection pin by punching through the PDMS using a 22 - gauge leur stub ( McMaster - Carr ) . Then , the ports of the PDMS device were washed with DI water to remove any PDMS debris inside , and the exterior of the PDMS device was cleaned with 70 % ethanol and rinsed with deionized water . The cleaned PDMS devices were incubated at 75¬∞C overnight to remove any residual water . The dried devices were cleaned with scotch tape to remove any debris on the surface of the PDMS . Then , the PDMS device and a clean glass cover slip were treated using a BD - 20AC Laboratory Corona Treater ( Electro - Technic Products ) for ~ 30 seconds and bonded with each other . After bonding , the microfluidic devices were incubated at 75¬∞C overnight to facilitate the formation of the covalent bond between the PDMS and the glass cover slip . Autocorrelation Calculations The autocorrelation of the CFP signal , f ( t ) , is given by ùëÖùëÖ ( ùúèùúè ) = 1 ùëÅùëÅ ‚àí ùúèùúè ÔøΩ ùëìùëìÃÉ ( ùëõùëõ + ùúèùúè ) ùëìùëìÃÉ ( ùëõùëõ ) ùëÅùëÅ‚àíùúèùúè‚àí1 ùëõùëõ = 0 where ùëìùëìÃÉ = ùëìùëì ‚àí 1 ùëÅùëÅ ÔøΩ ùëìùëì ( ùëõùëõ ) ùëÅùëÅ‚àí1 ùëõùëõ = 1 œÑ is the lag time , and N is the number of time points . This function was then normalized so that the value of ùëÖùëÖ ( 0 ) = 1 . We used a modified version of this standard formula to avoid overcounting of branched data . When a mother cell divides into two daughter cells , the overcounting correction removes one instance of the contribution from the mother‚Äôs portion of the lineage , which is common between the daughters . Thus , the initial contribution is only counted once and not twice . Details of the modified autocorrelation formula are available in 2 . 6 SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES Supplementary Figure 1 : The fused protein MarA - CFP has a ~ 30 min half - life . To determine the half - life of MarA - CFP , we overexpressed it from an IPTG inducible promoter and added chloramphenicol to arrest protein synthesis . Western blot analysis shows MarA - CFP levels at different times , detected using an anti - MarA antibody . Total protein level was normalized between samples . These results are a representative example of one of three biological replicates . 7 Supplementary Figure 2 : Inducible fluorescent reporter does not show a correlation between fluorescence levels and carbenicillin survival . ( a ) Extracted fluorescence data for a microcolony expressing the P lac - cfp reporter . Each gray line corresponds to a single cell lineage and green lines highlight representative lineages . ( b ) Outcomes of P lac - cfp cells after 400 mins of exposure to 50 Œºg / ml carbenicillin . Each blue dot corresponds to one cell , which has an outcome of ‚Äòlysed‚Äô or ‚Äòfilamented‚Äô and an initial fluorescence value . The number of cells exhibiting each outcome is listed on the x - axis . 8 Supplementary Figure 3 : MarA - CFP protein fusion has low cell - to - cell variability . ( a ) Extracted fluorescence data from a microcolony expressing the MarA - CFP reporter . Each gray line corresponds to a single cell lineage and green lines highlight representative lineages . ( b ) The average autocorrelation of fluorescence levels shows differences in dynamics between P marA - cfp ( blue ) and MarA - CFP ( red ) . Error bars show standard deviation across six microcolonies for P marA - cfp and three microcolonies for MarA - CFP . Note that the longer autocorrelation times for MarA - CFP are expected due to slower growth of this strain and the stabilized CFP reporter . 9 Supplementary Figure 4 : P marA - cfp lysed and filamented cell distributions have statistically different means . Data from Fig . 2b , d , and f plotted as histograms with lysed cell distributions in red and filamented in cyan : ( a ) P marA - cfp , ( b ) P marA - cfp Œî marRAB , and ( c ) MarA - CFP . In our microscopy images some cells were at or near the autofluorescence level , creating an artificial peak in the data at low fluorescence values for some of the strains . To account for this , we set a threshold , shown with a black dashed line ( fluorescence = 800 a . u . ) , and included only data that exceeded this threshold in our statistical tests . Only the P marA - cfp lysed and filamented cell distributions have statistically different means ( P < 0 . 01 by a Mann - Whitney rank sum test ) . We note that results are not sensitive to the exact threshold value used . 10 SUPPLEMENTARY MOVIE LEGENDS Supplementary Movie 1 : Time - lapse movie showing cell - to - cell variability of MarA expression .
