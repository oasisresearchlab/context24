Each of its modalities requires speciﬁc sample preparation and imag - ing conditions to obtain high - quality , artefact - free images , ulti - mately providing complementary information . Combining and multiplexing microscopy approaches is crucial to understand cellular events , but requires elaborate workﬂows involving mul - tiple sample preparation steps . We present a robust ﬂuidics ap - proach to automate complex sequences of treatment , labelling and imaging of live and ﬁxed cells . Our open - source NanoJ - Fluidics system is based on low - cost LEGO hardware controlled by ImageJ - based software and can be directly adapted to any microscope , providing easy - to - implement high - content , multi - modal imaging with high reproducibility . We demonstrate its capacity to carry out complex sequences of experiments such as super - resolved live - to - ﬁxed imaging to study actin dynamics ; highly - multiplexed STORM and DNA - PAINT acquisitions of multiple targets ; and event - driven ﬁxation microscopy to study the role of adhesion contacts in mitosis .

It is generally performed using dedicated sample preparation procedures , tailored to achieve optimal imaging conditions for each chosen tech - nique . Obtaining the best possible temporal and spatial reso - lution , while keeping a high signal , capacity for deep imaging and live - cell compatibility is nearly impossible with a " one - size ﬁts all” approach . As such , each microscopy method en - tails a compromise between some of these features ( 1 ) . Al - ternatively , unique insights can be gained by combining in - formation from multiple approaches , but at the cost of com - plex correlative workﬂows ( 2 , 3 ) . Recent developments to - ward high - resolution imaging of a large number of molecular targets have further broadened the variety and complexity of imaging procedures , with the use of multiple rounds of la - belling and imaging ( 4 – 7 ) . These elaborate protocols involve sequences of sample imaging , washing and labelling . Car - rying these protocols in a non - automated manner critically Fig . 1 .

Automated ﬂuid handling using microﬂuidic chips presents an attractive alternative , but adds speciﬁc constrains on cul - turing conditions and sample preparation ( 5 , 9 ) . A more simple and tractable method would automate ﬂuid exchange in commonly used open imaging chambers , in a manner similar to standard laboratory protocols , while being eas - ily adaptable to existing microscope stages . For this , we devised an easy - to - implement open - source system called NanoJ - Fluidics ( Fig . 1a - b ) , which primarily consists of an automated computer - controlled syringe pump array capa - ble of rapidly and robustly exchanging sample conditions . This allows the automation of the protocols of sample treat - ment , labelling and preparation directly on the microscope stage ( Fig . 1c and S1 ) . Our approach makes complex multi - modal imaging protocols highly accessible to researchers . To demonstrate this , we performed a range of complex multi - step experiments : ﬁrst , we devised live - to - ﬁxed experiments with time - lapse imaging of living cells expressing reporter probes , followed by in - situ online ﬁxation , labelling and super - resolved imaging , thus connecting the dynamics and structural dimensions of cellular processes ( Fig . 2 and Movie S1 ) . Next , we used NanoJ - Fluidics to automate a highly - multiplexed STORM and DNA - PAINT acquisition to obtain a ﬁve - colour nanoscopic image of distinct cellular targets ( Fig . 3 and Movie S2 ) .

Results The NanoJ - Fluidics framework . NanoJ - Fluidics is a com - plete system , using off - the - shelf components , as well as open - source control software . The hardware component con - sists of compact LEGO® syringe pumps ( Fig . 1a ) that can be conﬁgured as a multiplexed array of up to 128 syringes ( Fig . 1b ) , plus a peristaltic pump and an open - source Ar - duino® electronic controller to interface with the microscope acquisition computer ( Fig . 1b ) . By using LEGO parts , the system is cost - effective , robust and repeatable thanks to the high - quality standards and low tolerances of the LEGO man - ufacturing process . The system performs labelling and treat - ment protocols that were traditionally done on the bench , but these steps can be directly automated on the microscope stage ( Fig . S1 ) . For instance , a wash step will completely remove liquid from the imaging chamber and replenish it with wash buffer . The system is easy to set up ( Sup . Note 1 ) , highly modular and compatible with most microscopes and exper - imental workﬂows ( Fig . S1 ) . NanoJ - Fluidics does not re - quire any design and microfabication process and simply uses common labware ( Fig . S2 ) . The software component is pro - vided as an ImageJ / Micro - Manager plugin ( 10 , 11 ) as well as a stand - alone package for independent ﬂuidics control ( Sup . Software ) . By allowing precise control of each steps in the protocol ( Fig . S3 ) , NanoJ - Fluidics provides a highly repeat - able and robust way to carry out imaging experiments directly onto the microscope . Live - to - ﬁxed super - resolution microscopy . Although super - resolution microscopy in living cells is achievable with techniques such as SIM ( 12 ) , RESOLFT ( 13 ) and SRRF ( 14 ) , near molecular scale super - resolution microscopy using single - molecule localisation microscopy ( SMLM ) is typi - cally limited to ﬁxed - cell imaging . This is due to the require - ment for non - physiological conditions , including the use of anti - fading media and high - intensity illumination ( 15 , 16 ) typically required for commonly used approaches such as STORM ( 17 , 18 ) and DNA - PAINT ( 19 ) . NanoJ - Fluidics ad - dresses this issue , by allowing the combination of both dy - namic live - cell and subsequent ﬁxed - cell high - resolution ob - servations on the same set of cells . To demonstrate this , we carried out a sequence of live - cell imaging , ﬁxation , labelling and STORM imaging of actin within COS cells ( Fig . 2a ) . Thanks to its compatibility with most standard microscopes and cell friendly low - illumination requirements , the SRRF approach was chosen to achieve live - cell super - resolution imaging of GFP labelled utrophin calponin homology domain , a validated actin probe ( 20 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . SRRF achieved an improved resolution ( ≥ 175 nm , S4 ) over the standard wide - ﬁeld images ( HILO , ≥ 270 nm , S4 ) , resolving the assembly and disassembly of actin bun - dles during cell - shape changes ( Fig . 2b and Sup . Movie S1 ) . We then used NanoJ - Fluidics to perform automated ﬁxation , washing , permeabilisation and phalloidin - AF647 staining , a sequence lasting 100 min ( Fig . 2a ) . We ﬁnally performed a STORM acquisition on the previously imaged cell after per - fusing the optimised imaging buffer ( Fig . 2c ) . The structural detail of the actin organisation observed by STORM is con - siderably higher than the live - cell observation , with an esti - mated resolution of ≥ 43 nm . An extended characterisation of the resolutions achieved here is described in Sup . Note 2 and Fig . S4 , using NanoJ - SQUIRREL ( 21 ) . Our system thus pro - vides easy correlative live - cell and ﬁxed - cell super - resolution imaging . Interestingly , these observations also make it pos - sible to evaluate if there are unwanted structural changes to cells caused by the ﬁxation process ( shown and discussed in Sup . Note 3 ) . Multiplexed super - resolution microscopy with STORM and DNA - PAINT . Obtaining a super - resolution , high - quality multi - channel image has long been a challenge in SMLM as a consequence of the difﬁculty to optimise labelling and imag - ing for many labels simultaneously ( 22 ) . NanoJ - Fluidics is ideally suited for large channel multiplexing via sequen - tial exchange of ﬂuorescent labels and / or imaging buffers . Furthermore , recent DNA - PAINT modalities can reach more than the typical 2 - 3 label channels by using antibodies cou - pled to orthogonal DNA strands , and sequential labelling combined with imaging sequences of PAINT imagers ( 23 – 25 ) . Here , we demonstrate how NanoJ - Fluidics easily handles se - quential STORM and DNA - PAINT acquisitions in a sim - ple and optimal manner . Fixed cells were labelled using DNA - coupled primary antibodies targeting mitochondria , vi - mentin , microtubules and clathrin , as well as ﬂuorescent phalloidin to label actin .

Note 2 and Fig . S5 ) . Fixation - on - event imaging . NanoJ - Fluidics has also the advantage of allowing sample treatments , such as ﬁxation , at precise times during the experiment . Thanks to the in - tegration of NanoJ - Fluidics with the image acquisition , de - termining the time of treatment can be triggered by visual queues obtained from the imaging . To demonstrate this ca - pacity , we carried out an experiment observing the state of focal adhesions , as mammalian cells progress into division . Fixation was triggered by the observation of the rounding of the cells as they approach mitosis ( 27 ) . Also , in order to fully exploit the ﬂuidics automation of NanoJ - Fluidics , we com - bined it with tiling imaging and image stitching in order to obtain ﬁelds - of - view of several millimetres while conserving high - resolution . We ﬁrst blocked asynchronous cells in G2 via treatment with a CDK1 inhibitor ( RPE1 cells expressing zyxin - GFP ) . Next , the cell cycle was released by exchanging the inhibitor by growth media using NanoJ - Fluidics ( Fig . 4a ) and imaged by live - cell time - lapse microscopy ( Fig . 4b ) . When the ob - served cells reached a minimal area ( an indicator of mitotic rounding ) , the ﬁxative was injected ( Fig . 4a - b ) . A consid - erable portion of cells ( ≥ 10 % ) were found to be ﬁxed in a similar rounding state due to the simultaneous release of the G2 block ( insets of Fig . 4c I , Sup . Movie S3 ) . The sample was then immunolabelled for b 1 - integrin , plus co - stained for F - actin and DNA , then imaged ( Fig . 4 c III - VI ) . Both actin and DNA staining allowed a secondary visual validation of pre - mitotic cell rounding . As we recently described using comparable experiments ( 28 ) , b 1 - integrin is shown to retain a similar spatial pattern similar to zyxin when the cells were spread on the substrate , in their pre - division shape ( Fig . 4d ) . We observed that , while zyxin retracts during cell rounding ( Fig . 4b ) , b 1 - integrin remains in its original position ( Fig . 4d and Sup . Movie S3 ) , helping guide daughter cell migration ( 28 ) . Almada & Pereira et al . | NanoJ - Fluidics bioR ‰ iv | 3 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

Discussion We introduce NanoJ - Fluidics ( Fig . 1 ) and demonstrate its ap - plicability in multiple experimental contexts : in - situ correla - tive live - to - ﬁxed super - resolution imaging ( Fig . 2 ) ; multi - modal multi - label super - resolution imaging ( Fig . 3 ) ; and high - content , event - driven correlative live - to - ﬁxed imaging ( Fig . 4 ) . The reliability provided by the computer - controlled ﬂuidic experiments overcomes the issues of repeatability and low throughput of traditional , non - automated approaches . Effortless correlative live - cell and ﬁxed - cell super - resolution imaging ( Fig . 2 ) enables a synergy between the dynamic but less spatially resolved information obtained from live - cell imaging and the near molecular - scale structural information provided by SMLM . The NanoJ - Fluidics framework allows to do this in - situ without the laborious requirement of relo - cating multiple cells or performing manual immunolabelling steps . The live - to - ﬁxed transition , and more generally sam - ple treatment , can also be based on speciﬁc biological cues , allowing for event - driven correlative live - cell and ﬁxed - cell imaging ( Fig . 4 ) .

Besides this potential for complex biological interrogation , the simplicity and robustness of the NanoJ - Fluidics facili - tates experimental optimisation ( Sup . Note 3 ) ( 21 ) . To ob - tain optimal SMLM images , for example , the type , timing and concentration of ﬁxation , permeabilisation and blocking reagents , the antibody concentration , the ﬂuorophores used and the composition of the imaging buffer should be opti - mised . However , tuning each step individually and especially in combination is a daunting task . The NanoJ - ﬂuidics au - tomation and its integration with imaging allows for a more comprehensive and reliable exploration of the many options available ( 21 , 34 – 38 ) . Fluorescent microscopy is widely used for its molecular speciﬁcity of labelling and its potential for multi - colour imaging . However , SMLM microscopy approaches tend to be restricted to a couple of colours due to ﬂuorophore photophysics requiring speciﬁc imaging buffers . A ﬂexi - ble and easy - to - use ﬂuidics system , such as NanoJ - Fluidics is a signiﬁcant advance in this context : the easy combina - tion of STORM ( 22 ) with DNA - PAINT ( 23 – 25 , 39 ) , as we demonstrate in Fig . 3 , and the potential to perform sequen - tial labelling protocols ( e . g . bleaching or antibody removal ( 40 , 41 ) ) can extend high spatial resolution multiplexing far beyond what live - cell ﬂuorescent microscopy can currently achieve . NanoJ - Fluidics is easy ( and fun ) to set up and use . Its highly modular design means that the system can be easily adapted for speciﬁc experiments , such as by detaching syringe pump modules to be kept at different temperature ( Fig . S1 ) . There are several advantages to the NanoJ - Fluidics design com - pared to standard ﬂow cells : glass - bottom chambers are eas - ier to prepare in comparison to microﬂuidic chips ; unwanted air bubbles formed in the tubing are easily dissipated be - fore corrupting the sample ; being a non - pressurised system means that there is higher tolerance to ﬂow - rate ﬂuctuations . Notwithstanding , ﬂow cells have the general advantage of requiring smaller volumes of reagents . Automated pipet - ting robots are also a good alternative , being particularly ef - ﬁcient in multiwell high - content experiments ( 42 ) , but are generally restricted to highly specialised laboratories . The open - source software component of the NanoJ - Fluidics pro - vides an Application Programming Interface ( API ) and plu - gin framework that allows third party syringe pumps , such as those commercially available , to be controlled by the com - mon NanoJ - Fluidics graphical user interface ( GUI , Fig . S3 ) . This means that the automation protocols established here are directly applicable to pre - existing or alternative hardware . In this work we have chosen to focus mainly on the applica - tion of NanoJ - Fluidics to live - cell imaging and SMLM ap - proaches , as each SMLM imaging requires a ﬁnely - tuned chemical environments to produce high - resolution images . However , our ﬂuidic exchange system can be used in any imaging experiments that would beneﬁt from an automated exchange of the sample media . Our Micro - Manager plugin already allows for NanoJ - Fluidics to be fully integrated into microscopy acquisition software , enabling a seamless combi - nation between the imaging and ﬂuid exchange protocol . In conclusion , NanoJ - Fluidics makes high - content multi - modal microscopy experiments tractable and available to a large au - dience of researchers , while improving reliability , optimisa - tion and repeatability of imaging protocols .

All cells were grown at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 humidiﬁed incubator . Cell lines have not been authenticated . Plasmids . GFP - UtrCH was a gift from William Bement ( 2 ) ( Addgene plasmid # 26737 ) . Antibody conjugation . Secondary antibodies ( see bellow for details ) were labelled with DNA strands ( see bellow for details ) as previously described ( 3 ) . In short , secondary antibodies were concentrated via amicon 100 kDa spin ﬁlters to 2 - 6 mg / ml . 50 - 100 µg of antibody was labelled using a Maleimide - Peg2 - succinimidyl ester for 90 min at 40x molar excess at 4°C on a shaker . Crosslinker stocks of 10 mg / ml in DMF were diluted in 1x PBS to reach 40x molar excess in 5 µl , which were subsequently added to the antibody . After the reaction had been done , unreacted crosslinker was removed via a zeba spin column . Thiolated DNA was reduced using DTT for 2h at room temperature . DTT was separated from the reduced DNA via a Nap5 column and fractions containing DNA were concentrated via 3 kDa amicon spin ﬁlters . The reduced DNA was then added to the antibody bearing a functional maleimide group in 25x molar excess and incubated over night at 4°C on a shaker in the dark . Antibody - DNA constructs were ﬁnally puriﬁed via 100 kDa amicon spin ﬁlters .

We provide the detailed in - structions to easily build and use the system in a regular bi - ology lab , as well as the software enabling its control and automation ( Sup . Note 1 ) . Live - to - Fixed Super - Resolution imaging . The NanoJ - Fluidics syringe pump array was installed on a Nikon N - STORM microscope equipped with 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 nm lasers ( 20 , 50 , 50 and 125 mW at the optical ﬁber output ) . One individual syringe pump module containing the ﬁxative was kept within the incubator of the microscope at 37°C . All steps after cell transfection were performed on the microscope , using NanoJ - Fluidics . COS7 cells were seeded on ultraclean ( 5 ) 25 mm diameter thickness 1 . 5H coverslips ( Marienfeld ) at a density of 0 . 3 – 0 . 9x10 5 cells / cm 2 . One day after splitting , cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the calponin homology domain of utrophin fused to GFP ( GFP - UtrCH ) using Lipofectamin 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Sci - entiﬁc ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Cells were imaged 1 - 2 days post transfection in culture medium using an Attoﬂuor cell chamber ( Thermoﬁsher ) , covered with the lid of a 35 mm dish ( Thermoﬁsher ) , that was kept in place using black non - reﬂective aluminum tape ( T205 - 1 . 0—AT205 , THORLABs ) . Cells were ﬁxed at 37°C for 15 minutes with 4 % paraformaldehyde in cytoskeleton - preserving buffer ( 1X PEM , 80 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl2 ) ( 6 ) . After ﬁxation cells were permeabilised ( 1X PEM with 0 . 25 % Triton - X ) for 20 min , blocked with blocking buffer ( 5 % Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) in 1X PEM ) for 30 minutes , and stained with Phalloidin - AF647 ( Molecular Probes , 4 units / mL ) for 30 minutes . Laser - illumination Highly Inclined and Laminated Optical sheet ( HILO ) imaging of Utrophin - GFP in live COS7 cells was performed at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 on a Nikon N - STORM microscope . A 100x TIRF objective ( Plan - APOCHROMAT 100x / 1 . 49 Oil , Nikon ) with additional 1 . 5x magniﬁcation was used to collect ﬂuorescence onto an EMCCD camera ( iXon Ultra 897 , Andor ) , yielding a pixel size of 107 nm . For timelapse imaging , 100 raw frames ( 33 ms exposure ) were acquired once every 10 minutes ( with the illumination shut - ter closed between acquisitions ) for 150 minutes with 488 nm laser illumination at 4 % of maximum output . STORM HILO imaging of Alexa Fluor 647 - phalloidin in ﬁxed cells was performed on the same system . 50 , 000 frames were acquired with 33 ms exposure and 642 nm laser illumination at maximum output power with 405 nm pumping when required . STORM imaging was performed in GLOX buffer ( 150mM Tris , pH 8 , 1 % glycerol , 1 % glucose , 10mM NaCl , 1 % b - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 5 mg / ml glucose oxidase , 40 µg / ml catalase ) supplemented with Phalloidin - Alexa Fluor 647 ( 1 U / mL ) .

After rinses , they were incu - bated with Exchange - PAINT secondary antibodies coupled to DNA sequences : goat anti - mouse I1 , goat anti - chicken I2 , goat anti - rabbit I3 and donkey anti - rat I4 for 1 . 5 hours at RT ( see Ab conjugation section for antibody and sequence details ) . After rinses , they were incubated in phalloidin - Atto488 ( Sigma ) at 12 . 5 µM for 90 min at RT and imaged within a few days . For STORM / PAINT imaging , the NanoJ - Fluidics array was installed on an N - STORM microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 nm lasers ( 25 , 80 , 80 and 125 mW at the optical ﬁber output ) . First , a STORM image of phalloidin - ATTO488 was performed in buffer C ( PBS 0 . 1M pH7 . 2 , 500 mM NaCl ) using 30 , 000 frames at 30 ms / frame at 50 % power of the 488 nm laser . After injection of the I1 - ATTO655 and I2 - CY3B imagers in buffer C , 60 , 000 frames were aquired in an alternating way ( 647 nm at 60 % and 561 nm at 30 % ) to image TOM20 and vimentin , respectively . After three rinses with buffer C , I3 - Cy3B and I4 - ATTO655 were in buffer C were injected , and 60 , 000 frames were aquired in an alternating way ( 561 nm at 30 % 647 nm at 60 % ) to image clathrin and microtubules , respectively . All imager strands were used at concentration between 0 . 25 and 2 nM . Event Detection and Live - to - Fix Imaging . hTERT - RPE1 cells stably expressing Zyxin - GFP were incubated with 9 mM Ro - 3306 ( Enzolife Sciences ALX - 270 - 463 ) to inhibit CDK1 activity for 15 - 20 hours . Inhibition was released by replacing drug containing media by fresh media at the microscope immediately before imaging . Cells were im - aged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with an Neo - Zyla sCMOS camera ( Andor ) , LED illumina - tion ( CoolLED ) and a 60X objective ( Plan Apo 60X / 1 . 4 Oil , Nikon ) . Images were acquired every 3 min until enough cells had underwent mitotic rounding . At that point , 16 % warmed PFA was added to cells in media to a ﬁnal concentration of 4 % , and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes . They were then washed 3 times and 0 . 2 % Triton was added for 5 minutes . 5 % BSA in 1X PBS was used to block for 30 min at room temperature , before activated b 1 Integrin ( Ab - cam # ab30394 ) primary antibody was added . After incu - bation and washing , Phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and anti - mouse AF647 antibody ( Invitrogen ) were added . All of these steps were performed automatically using the NanoJ - Fluidics platform . SMLM and SRRF image reconstruction . For Fig . 2 images were reconstructed using NanoJ - SRRF ( 7 ) ( TRPPM for live cell data and TRM for ﬁxed cell data with a magniﬁ - cation of 4 ) . Drift was estimated using the inbuilt function in NanoJ - SRRF and correction applied during SRRF analysis . For ﬁgure 3 localizations were detected using the N - STORM software ( Nikon ) , and exported as a text ﬁle before being ﬁltered and rendered using ThunderSTORM ( 8 ) . Chromatic aberration between the red ( 561 nm ) and far - red ( 647 nm ) channels were corrected within the N - STORM software using polynomial warping , and remaining translational drift between acquisition passes were aligned manually on high - resolution reconstructions . FRC values were obtained using NanoJ - SQUIRREL after re - construction of original data separated into two two different stacks composed of odd or even images ( 9 ) . NanoJ - SRRF , NanoJ - SQUIRREL and ThunderSTORM are available in Fiji ( 10 ) . Bibliography 1 . ChristinaL . Dix , HelenK .

Design and capabilities . The NanoJ - Fluidics system is designed primarily for the sequential exchange of liquids in a glass - bottom cell culture dish ( or equivalent supports , such as ATTOﬂuor coverlslip holders for example ) . It consists of several parts : LEGO based syringe pumps responsible for delivering reagents to the sample ( Fig . 1a ) ; electronics responsible for controlling the pumps ( Fig . 1b - d ) ; a peristaltic pump responsible for removing reagents from the sample ( Fig . 1d ) ; ﬂuid handling disposable components ( Fig . 1e - f ) . The syringe pumps are designed to accommodate syringes of any size , to be cost - effective and simple to assemble . A syringe pump unit uses a simple gear and actuator system to translate fast motor motion to smooth and slower linear motion , to enable consistent ﬂuid ﬂow . The result is that the ﬂow - rate will depend on the gears , motor speed and the syringe’s internal diameter . The pumps can be calibrated by measuring the ﬂow - rate obtained at a given motor speed and syringe volume . Given these reference values , the ﬂow - rate for any other syringe diameter ( R d ) can be determined using Eq . S1 : R d = R r 1 d d r 2 2 ( S1 ) Where d is the syringe diameter , d r is the reference diameter and R r is the reference rate . With the current design , a 1mm BD Plastipak syringe with an internal diameter of 4 . 699mm was measured to obtain a nominal ﬂow - rate of 2 . 3 ± 0 . 08 m L / s at maximum motor speed . Based on this value , Table S1 summarizes the limits for different BD Plastipak syringe volumes 2 | Supplementary Information Almada & Pereira et al . | NanoJ - Fluidics not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Table S1 also shows the maximum loading volume for each syringe given that this will be limited by the length of the linear actuators on the pumps . Nominal Volume ( mL ) Max .

Flow - rates obtained from Eq . S1 for several BD Plastipak syringes . Minimal ﬂow rate is limited by the minimal rotation speed achievable by the DC LEGO motors without stalling . Both the syringe pump array ( for media injection ) and peristaltic pump ( for media removal ) are digitally run using an Arduino UNO micro - controller and Adafruit Motorshield digital - to - analogue motor control . The Motorshield is an additional electronic board that connects to the top of the Arduino controller , enabling it to run up to 4 LEGO motors . An Arduino can be stacked with up to 32 Motorshields , limiting the controller to a maximum of 128 pumps , which should be sufﬁcient for most NanoJ - Fluidics applications . We provide custom open - source ﬁrmware that enables the Arduino - based electronics to be programmatically controlled by a connected computer . We also provide a Java - based graphical user interface ( GUI ) for simple control of the ﬂuidics sequences ( Fig . S2 ) . The software interface can be set to automatically perform a sequence of liquid injection and liquid removal steps ( Sup . Note Fig . S3 ) allowing an entire sample ﬁxation or labelling protocol to be carried as shown in Fig . 2 - 3 , 4 . Assembly . The steps to prepare a complete functioning NanoJ - Fluidics system ( Fig . S2 and S1 ) consist of assembling the pump array , controller , and wiring them together ( Fig . S2a - d ) . Once the array and controller have been assembled , each experiment only requires the lab - ware component to be prepared anew ( Fig . S2 e - g ) . A full step - by - step guide for assembly and preparation can be found in https : / / github . com / HenriquesLab / NanoJ - Fluidics / wiki . NanoJ - Fluidics can also be used with more traditional microﬂuidics devices , such as Polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) chips , however we have focused on providing a series of protocols using off - the - shelf labware ( e . g . glass - bottom cell culture dishes ) . This approach makes the framework more accessible to laboratories that do not otherwise have the facilities to produce PDMS devices . When using culture dishes the primary use of the system is limited to liquid exchange , this effectively reproduces many laboratory protocols including cell ﬁxation , immunolabeling , drug treatment , among others .

Control of the NanoJ - Fluidics pump array can be achieved in one of three ways : by using the provided Java - based GUI ( Fig . S3 ) ; RS232 commands to the Arduino board ; or by using the Application Programming Interface ( API ) . A description of these is available at https : / / github . com / HenriquesLab / NanoJ - Fluidics / wiki . The RS232 command scheme enables researchers with programming experience to run the controller directly in their own software packages . However , the GUI was designed to enable any user to directly run any number of Arduino controllers and pumps , as well as design a sequence of steps associated to an experimental protocol ( Fig . S3 ) . NanoJ - Fluidics is controlled by a set of Java classes described in the API . For example , these can be used to enable a protocol generated in the GUI to be programmatically started and manipulated by outside applications , such as a microscope control software such as Micro - Manager ( 1 ) . This enables complex automated protocols , such as pre - screening in live imaging to try and capture speciﬁc events , such as mitosis ( 2 , 3 ) , before ﬁxing and further analysis the sample ( Fig . 4 ) . Therefore , by using the NanoJ - Fluidics GUI and API , any combination of sample acquisition and liquid manipulation protocols can be performed in a completely automated manner . 4 | Supplementary Information Almada & Pereira et al . | NanoJ - Fluidics not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Resolution maps calculated through NanoJ - SQUIRREL . Black outlines in middle and bottom rows indicate the cell shape mask used for calculation of mean and minimum resolutions across each channel . To estimate the local resolution achieved in the super - resolution renderings associated to the main ﬁgures , we carried out analysis using the Fourier Ring Correlation method ( 5 ) , recently modiﬁed in ( 4 ) to generate a resolution map . Fig . S4 shows that the best resolution achieved for live - cell imaging with SRRF is 175nm , and 43nm for ﬁxed - cell imaging with STORM . Fig . S5 shows that the best resolution achieved in the DNA - PAINT channels is ≥ 67nm , with the exception of the actin channel which has an estimated best resolution of 97nm .

S6 . Analysis of changes in cell morphology and labelling pre - and post - ﬁxation . a ) Comparison of the distribution of GFP - labelled Utrophin in the cell shown in Fig . 2 and Movie S1 , imaged in HILO . The last timepoint pre - ﬁxation ( ‘HILO GFP - live’ ) and an image post - ﬁxation of the same region ( ‘HILO GFP - ﬁxed’ ) are shown . ‘Merge’ shows an overlay of the live ( green ) and ﬁxed ( magenta ) images . ‘Difference’ shows the result of subtracting the ﬁxed image from the live image . b ) As in ( a ) , except using the SRRF reconstructions of the data . The yellow arrows in ‘Merge’ show parts of the cell which moved during ﬁxation as measured using the elastic channel registration tool in NanoJ - SQUIRREL ( 4 ) . c ) Error maps generated between the ( ﬁxed ) STORM reconstruction of actin in this cell when using the live - cell GFP HILO image ( left ) or the ﬁxed - cell GFP HILO image ( right ) as a reference . d ) Error maps generated between the SRRF reconstruction of GFP in the ﬁxed cell when using the live - cell GFP HILO image ( left ) or the ﬁxed - cell GFP HILO image ( right ) as the reference . Scale bars = 10 µm . To verify that there were no major alterations in cell morphology during ﬁxation , we compared images of the same cell immediately before and after ﬁxation . Fig . S6a shows pre - and post - ﬁxation images for HILO imaging of the cell shown in Fig . 2 , and Fig . S6b shows these changes for SRRF reconstructions of the same region . Overlaying both the SRRF and HILO images pre - and post - ﬁxation shows that the morphology of the cell remains largely constant during ﬁxation . There is movement of the bright ﬁlaments within the cell body and ﬁlopodia at the cell periphery on a sub - micron scale . This degree of movement is comparable to or smaller than the frame - to - frame movement shown in Movie S1 . There is also a loss of ﬂuorescence intensity during ﬁxation in the top left portion of the region shown in Fig . S6 . 6 | Supplementary Information Almada & Pereira et al . | NanoJ - Fluidics not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .
