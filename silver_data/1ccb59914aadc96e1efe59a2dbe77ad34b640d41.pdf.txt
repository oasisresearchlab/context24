Department of Building Science , School of Architecture , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China 2 . Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the cause of the current coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , is evolving . Thus , the risk of airborne transmission in confined spaces may be higher , and corresponding precautions should be re - appraised . Here , we obtained the quantum generation rate ( q ) value of three SARS - CoV - 2 variants ( Alpha , Delta , and Omicron ) for the Wells - Riley equation with a reproductive number - based fitted approach and estimated the association between the infection probability and ventilation rates . The q value was 89 – 165 h −1 for Alpha variant , 312 – 935 h −1 for Delta variant , and 725 – 2 , 345 h −1 for Omicron variant . The ventilation rates increased to ensure an infection probability of less than 1 % , and were 8 , 000 – 14 , 000 m 3 h −1 , 26 , 000 – 80 , 000 m 3 h −1 , and 64 , 000 – 250 , 000 m 3 h −1 per infector for the Alpha , Delta , and Omicron variants , respectively . If the infector and susceptible person wore N95 masks , the required ventilation rates decreased to about 1 / 100 of the values required without masks , which can be achieved in most typical scenarios . An air purifier was ineffective for reducing transmission when used in scenarios without masks . Preventing prolonged exposure time in confined spaces remains critical in reducing the risk of airborne transmission for highly contagious SARS - CoV - 2 variants .

Basic precautions were effective measures to reduce the risk , such as wearing masks , running air purifiers , and increasing the indoor ventilation rate , and people in different regions followed these measures as recommended by local authorities ( Liu and Zhao 2021 ; Zhao et al . 2021 ; WHO 2022a ) . Considering that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the cause of the current COVID - 19 pandemic , is constantly evolving , whether the original measures still ensure a low risk of airborne transmission deserves further discussion ( WHO 2022b ) . The WHO named and classified SARS - CoV - 2 variants based on the latest information on contagiousness , disease severity , risk of reinfection , etc . ( WHO 2022d ) . These variants are categorized as variants of concern ( VOCs ) , variants of interest ( VOIs ) , and variants under monitoring ( VUM ) . The VOC classification is based on high virus circulation , and people are most concerned about the dominant VOCs , i . e . , the currently circulating VOCs . The Alpha ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) variant emerged in the UK and was the first announced VOC to show higher transmissibility than the ancestral strain ( Burki 2021 ) . Subsequently , the Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) variant emerged in India and wreaked havoc around the globe ( Liu and Rocklöv 2021 ; Volz et al . 2021 ; WHO 2022c ) . The latest global epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 is characterized by the global dominance of the Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 ) variant that is replacing all other SARS - CoV - 2 variants ( Liu and Rocklöv 2022 ; WHO 2022c ) . Delta remains the only other named variant with significant reported circulation . Thus , Alpha , Delta and Omicron are the most dominant VOCs causing the fast spread of COVID - 19 in past months . B UILD S IMUL ( 2023 ) 16 : 3 – 12 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s12273 - 022 - 0952 - 6 Dai and Zhao / Building Simulation / Vol . 16 , No . 1 4 We have estimated the association between the airborne infection probability of the ancestral strain of COVID - 19 and ventilation rates with the Wells - Riley equation , where the quantum generation rate ( q ) of SARS - CoV - 2 was determined by a reproductive number ( R 0 ) - based fitted approach ( Dai and Zhao 2020 ) . The approach has been proven compromised but relatively reasonable , with estimated value of q in the same range as those reported in other studies with different approaches , such as the epidemiological case back - calculation method by Lu et al . ( 2020 ) and the prediction on the basis of the emitted viral load from the mouth by Buonanno et al . ( 2020 ) . However , the continuous evolution of SARS - CoV - 2 leads to a continuous change in the R 0 , further changing the estimated q value of COVID - 19 and its infection probability . The guidance on common ventilation strategies for reducing the transmission of the ancestral strain may not be sufficient for dealing with the SARS - CoV - 2 variants . Since the pandemic is ongoing with over 560 million confirmed cases globally , it is therefore urgent to update the data about the variants to face the changing epidemic situation . In the present study , we estimated the association between the infection probability of three SARS - CoV - 2 variants ( Alpha , Delta , and Omicron ) and ventilation rates . We followed the method proposed by Dai and Zhao ( 2020 ) to obtain the q value of the three dominate variants . Afterwards , we applied the Wells - Riley equation to re - evaluate the relationship between the ventilation rate and airborne infection probability of COVID - 19 caused by these three SARS - CoV - 2 variants . Furthermore , we estimated the effect of wearing masks of different efficiencies and running air purifiers on reducing the infection probability . 2 Method 2 . 1 Wells - Riley equation We employed the following Wells - Riley equation ( Riley et al . 1978 ) for scenarios without wearing masks or running air purifiers : 1 e Iqpt Q C P S - = = - ∕ ( 1 ) where : P is the probability of infection ; C is the number of cases of infection ; S is the total number of susceptible people in the space ; I is the number of sources of infection , which is set to 1 to consider cases where one infector present ; q is the quantum generation rate of airborne infection produced per infector per hour ; p is the pulmonary ventilation rate of each susceptible person , in m3 / h , which is 0 . 3 m3 / h when people are sitting or participating in light indoor activities ( Duan et al . 2013 ) ; t is the exposure time , in h ; Q is the ventilation rate of the room , in m3 / h . If indoor personnel wear masks , the filtering effect of the mask is equivalent to increasing the ventilation rate of the room . Both the ordinary medical surgical mask and N95 mask show a high filtration efficiency of more than 60 % for aerosols in the submicron range and almost 100 % for aerosols in the supermicron range , the two ranges to which SARS - CoV - 2 most commonly adheres ( Liu and Zhao 2021 ) . Considering the influence of air leakage , the filtration efficiency can be set as 50 % for ordinary medical surgical masks and 90 % for N95 masks on virus - laden aerosols ( Davies et al . 2013 ; Leung et al . 2020 ; Duncan et al . 2021 ) . We then changed Eq . ( 1 ) as : ( ) ( ) I S 1 1 / 1 e Iqpt η η Q C P S - - - = = - ( 2 ) where η I is the inhalation filtration efficiency and η S is the exhalation filtration efficiency . We also considered the dilution effect of the air purifier on the viruses , accounting for cases where the existing ventilation systems do not provide adequate ventilation rates or are not suitable for wearing masks ( Dai and Zhao 2022 ) . In these cases , the Wells - Riley equation could be changed to : / ( ) 1 e Iqpt Q CADR C P S - + = = - ( 3 ) where CADR ( clean air delivery rate ) is the amount of virus - free air the purifier can provide per hour , in m3 / h . The value was set to 361 m3 / h based on a previous survey of 100 best - selling air purifiers on major Chinese online shopping websites ( Zhao et al . 2020 ) . When indoor personnel are wearing masks and the air purifier is running simultaneously , we further changed the Wells - Riley equation to : ( ) ( ) I S 1 1 / ( ) 1 e Iqpt η η Q CADR C P S - - - + = = - ( 4 ) 2 . 2 The reproductive number - based fitting equation To obtain the q value of COVID - 19 , the most critical parameter for estimating the infection risk of viruses , we have proposed a reproductive number - based fitting approach . The estimated result has been validated in other studies with different approaches , and the accuracy of the method was proven to be satisfactory ( Dai and Zhao 2020 ) . The curve is fitted from five respiratory diseases with known values of R 0 and q . The principle of obtaining the q of COVID - 19 is based on real - time - published R 0 of COVID - 19 , so it can be applied to SARS - CoV - 2 variants as well as the ancestral strain . Therefore , we further used the validated fitted curve Dai and Zhao / Building Simulation / Vol . 16 , No . 1 5 to estimate the q for the SARS - CoV - 2 variants . The fitted equation is as follows ( Dai and Zhao 2020 ) : 2 1 0 2 0 q A B R B R = + ´ + ´ ( 5 ) where A = −30 . 27958 ± 26 . 07 , B 1 = −44 . 81536 ± 12 . 34048 , and B 2 = 19 . 67934 ± 0 . 62317 . 3 Results 3 . 1 Quantum generation rate of SARS - CoV - 2 variants A comparison of the ancestral strain and the studied three SARS - CoV - 2 variants based on the validated fitted curve is shown in Figure 1 . Table 1 shows the q values increased to 89 – 2 , 345 h −1 for the three variants , which were much larger than 14 – 48 h −1 , the value of the ancestral strain ( Dai and Zhao 2020 ) . Fig . 1 The estimated quantum generation rate ( q ) of SARS - CoV - 2 variants 3 . 2 Association between infection probability and ventilation rate 3 . 2 . 1 Infection probability The association between the infection probability and ventilation rate for the SARS - CoV - 2 variants with one infector in a confined space is shown in Figrues 2 – 5 . A ventilation rate larger than what is commonly applied is required to ensure an infection probability of less than 1 % for a susceptible person . For the Alpha variant , a ventilation rate of 650 – 1 , 200 m 3 h −1 was required for 0 . 25 h of exposure , while a ventilation rate of 8 , 000 – 14 , 000 m 3 h −1 was required for 3 h of exposure [ Figures 2 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ] . For the Delta variant , ventilation rates of 2 , 200 – 6 , 800 m 3 h −1 and 26 , 000 – 80 , 000 m 3 h −1 were required for 0 . 25 h and 3 h of exposure , respectively [ Figures 3 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ] . For the Omicron variant , 5 , 400 – 17 , 000 m 3 h −1 and 64 , 000 – 250 , 000 m 3 h −1 for 0 . 25 h and 3 h of exposure were required , repectively [ Figures 4 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ] . Figure 5 further shows that , without any additional measures , the Alpha variant requires a ventilation rate approximately four times more than the ancestral strain , while the Delta and Omicron variants require approximately 20 times and 50 times greater ventilation rates , respectively . If the infector and susceptible person wore ordinary medical surgical masks with a filtration efficiency of 50 % , the required ventilation rate was reduced to about 1 / 4 of the original values , which was less effective for reducing the infection probability for the Delta and Omicron variants [ Figures 3 – 4 ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ] . If N95 masks with a filtration efficiency of 90 % were worn , the ventilation rate was further reduced to about 1 / 100 of the original values , i . e . , 6 . 5 – 12 m 3 h −1 for 0 . 25 h of exposure and 80 – 140 m 3 h −1 for 3 h of exposure for the Alpha variant [ Figures 2 ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ] , 22 – 68 m 3 h −1 for 0 . 25 h of exposure and 260 – 800 m 3 h −1 for 3 h of exposure for the Delta variant [ Figures 3 ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ] , and 54 – 170 m 3 h −1 and 640 – 2 , 500 m 3 h −1 for 0 . 25 h and 3 h of exposure , respectively , for the Omicron variant [ Figures 4 ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ] . The required ventilation rate changed little with or without an air purifier , with a CADR of 351 m 3 h −1 [ Figures 2 – 4 ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ] . However , for cases where an air purifier was used and both the infector and susceptible person worn N95 masks in the confined space , the infection probability was less than 1 % with less than 3 h of exposure for the Alpha variant , even without any additional mechanical ventilation [ Figures 2 ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ] .

The different colored strips represent the range of the infection probability with the maximum and minimum value of q for the different variants infection probability was below 1 % in most cases , but a ventilation rate of 450 m 3 h −1 was required for 3 h of exposure when the q reached the maximum value [ Figures 3 ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ] . For the Omicron variant , natural ventilation or normal mechanical ventilation also provided a sufficient ventilation rate to ensure that the infection probability was less than 5 % for most cases [ Figures 4 ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ] . It should be noted that the effect of ordinary medical surgical masks was far less than that of N95 masks , and the infection probability at common ventilation rates was about 10 % for the Alpha and Delta variants , and even as high as 20 % for the Omicron variant [ Figures 2 – 4 ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ] . 3 . 2 . 2 Typical scenarios Tables 2 – 4 lists the estimated ventilation rates with different infection probabilities and the corresponding air change rates ( ACHs ) for typical confined space scenarios . These tables listed results for some realistic scenarios in order to meet different application needs . The results may serve as a basic data set for checking or determining required ventilation rates for confined spaces in actual engineering . The ACH is a measurement of how much fresh / clean air replaces the indoor air in one hour ( Sherman and Wilson 1986 ) , and is widely used in engineering to determine if ventilation and air conditioning systems can provide a sufficient ventilation rate . If people were wearing N95 masks , natural ventilation or normal mechanical ventilation provided a sufficient ventilation rate to ensure that the infection probability was less than 1 % for most scenarios . However , not wearing N95 masks resulted in a relatively higher infection risk in all cases for all three SARS - CoV - 2 variants , especially the Omicron variant . 4 Discussion The continuous rapid spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in the COVID - 19 epidemic highlights the much higher transmissibility of the SARS - CoV - 2 variants than the ancestral strain . The q values of the SARS - CoV - 2 variants increased dramatically , resulting in changes to the corresponding association between the infection probability and ventilation rate .

Dai and Zhao / Building Simulation / Vol . 16 , No . 1 10 increase in the ventilation rate is required for the three SARS - CoV - 2 variants to ensure the same low infection probability compared with the ancestral strain . Such update is critical and timely given the SARS - CoV - 2 variants are evolving so rapidly . Previous studies have proven that wearing an ordinary surgical mask can ensure a relatively low risk of infection in most scenarios for the ancestral strain ; however , it is less effective for the SARS - CoV - 2 variants , making it necessary to replace ordinary surgical masks with N95 masks to reduce the infection probability to approximately 1 % in most scenarios . Our findings also suggest that common air purifiers have little effect on reducing the risk of infection , while their effect can be amplified if N95 masks are worn . Therefore , wearing N95 masks is a very cost - effective prevention Table 3 Air change rate ( ACH ) versus the infection probability of the Delta variant ( N : no additional measure ; M : N95 masks worn ; P : air purifiers used ; M & P : N95 masks and air purifiers used , one infector inside ) Scenario Bus Classroom Aircraft cabin Office Volume ( m 3 ) 75 348 100 150 Exposure time ( h ) 0 . 5 2 . 0 4 . 0 8 . 0 Delta variant ACH ( h −1 ) Infection probability N M P M & P N M P M & P N M P M & P N M P M & P 2 . 0 % 30 . 7 0 . 31 26 . 0 \ 26 0 . 26 24 . 4 \ 180 1 . 80 175 \ 246 . 7 2 . 47 243 \ 1 . 5 % 41 . 2 0 . 41 36 . 0 \ 37 0 . 37 35 . 9 \ 247 2 . 47 243 \ 330 3 . 30 327 0 . 89 1 . 0 % 60 . 0 0 . 60 57 . 3 \ 54 0 . 54 53 . 2 \ 360 3 . 60 350 \ 493 4 . 93 490 2 . 4 0 . 5 % 126 1 . 26 120 \ 106 1 . 06 103 . 5 \ 740 7 . 40 735 4 . 0 987 9 . 87 980 7 . 5 0 . 1 % q = 312 h −1 576 5 . 76 573 1 . 2 517 0 . 52 502 4 . 0 3 , 700 37 . 0 3 , 650 32 . 0 4 , 933 49 . 33 4900 46 2 . 0 % 92 0 . 92 86 . 7 \ 79 0 . 79 77 . 6 \ 558 5 . 58 550 1 . 8 733 7 . 33 720 4 . 8 1 . 5 % 123 1 . 23 120 \ 106 1 . 06 104 \ 740 7 . 40 730 3 . 8 987 9 . 87 933 7 . 5 1 . 0 % 187 1 . 87 180 \ 160 1 . 60 158 0 . 5 1 , 020 10 . 2 1 , 010 7 . 5 1 , 467 14 . 67 1 , 400 12 . 0 0 . 5 % 373 3 . 73 367 \ 316 3 . 16 313 2 . 0 2 , 040 20 . 4 2 , 030 20 2 , 933 29 . 33 2 , 900 27 . 3 0 . 1 % q = 935 h −1 1 , 800 18 1 , 786 12 . 4 1 , 580 15 . 8 1 , 566 14 . 0 10 , 200 102 10 , 150 100 14 , 667 146 . 7 14 , 400 144 Note : The ACHs in red indicate that the ventilation rate could be achieved with a normal ventilation system or natural ventilation for the corresponding scenario . “ \ ” : The scenario can ensure the required infection probability without any additional mechanical ventilation rate .

Dai and Zhao / Building Simulation / Vol . 16 , No . 1 11 measure for daily use , which also means higher prevention costs for the SARS - CoV - 2 variants than the ancestral strain . Furthermore , preventing prolonged exposure times in confined public spaces remains critical for suppressing the spread of the SARS - CoV - 2 variants via airborne transmission . It is acknowledged that the Wells – Riley equation follows the assumption that the infection risk is uniform within the space . Besides , the R 0 may vary in infectious periods and different outbreaking regions . We should have to make sure that the range of each parameter is as reliable as possible so that the estimated results ( the range of q and the dataset of ventilation rates ) here can be indicative in engineering practice . Available evidence on the impacts of SARS - CoV - 2 variants is continuously reported in editions of the COVID - 19 Weekly Epidemiological Update of the WHO ( WHO 2022c ) . Since the last update on the 27 th of July 2022 , the Omicron variant continues to evolve and the overall global risk related to SARS - CoV - 2 variants remains very high . Several studies have tried determining the q value to estimate the infection risk of airborne infection of COVID - 19 in confined spaces , but there is no study determining the q value of SARS - CoV - 2 variants to date . It’s perhaps because another widely adopted digital model to determine q is on the basis of the viral load in the mouth ( e . g . viral RNA copies ) or the activity levels ( e . g . breathing , speaking , whispering ) of both the infector and susceptible people ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ) . Therefore , to update values of q for different variants with this approach is challenging as it needs more specific exposure scenarios and adequate medical pathological parameters . However , the method presented in this study can be employed to estimate the q value of SARS - CoV - 2 variants only according to their R 0 , and then to estimate the relationship between ventilation rate and the infection probability in confined spaces with the Wells - Riley equation . Such method may be further expected to guide common ventilation strategies for engineering epidemic prevention and control . 5 Conclusions With a reproductive number - based fitted approach , we updated the q values of three variants of concern ( VOCs ) to estimate the association of infection probability of SARS - CoV - 2 variants with ventilation rates in confined spaces . The main conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) The quantum generation rate of the SARS - CoV - 2 variants was estimated to be 89 – 165 h −1 for the Alpha variant , 312 – 935 h −1 for the Delta variant , and 725 – 2 , 345 h −1 for the Omicron variant . ( 2 ) An infection probability of less than 1 % in confined spaces for the variants required ventilation rates larger than that required for the ancestral strain ; these are not acceptable for actual engineering . ( 3 ) Wearing N95 masks was effective and can reduce the infection probability to less than 1 % at ventilation rates common in most scenarios ( 10 – 140 m 3 h −1 for the Alpha variant , 50 – 800 m 3 h −1 for the Delta variant , and 100 – 2 , 500 m 3 h −1 for the Omicron variant ) . ( 4 ) Air purifiers were not effective at reducing the risk of airborne transmission for highly contagious SARS - CoV - 2 variants when used in scenarios where N95 masks were not worn .
