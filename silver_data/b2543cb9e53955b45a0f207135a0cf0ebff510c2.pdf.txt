Supplementary Information Supplementary Figure 1 . Graphene insulates cells from the external environment over long periods . a , Combined fluorescence and bright - field microscopy images of fixed HeLa cells that were pre - labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 ( AF555 ) for tubulin ( green ) , partly covered with graphene , and incubated with AF647 - phalloidin ( red ) , a potent stain for cytoskeletal actin , for 16 h . b , The AF647 channel . c , The AF555 channel . Cells not covered by graphene were strongly labeled by AF647 , whereas no noticeable labeling was observed for graphene - covered cells ( solid arrows ) . As a control , the pre - labeled AF555 appeared equally strong for all cells . Cells close to the graphene edge are lightly stained by AF647 ( e . g . , dashed arrow ) , suggesting that leakage may gradually occur from the graphene edge over time .

Comparison of the correlated graphene - SEM and STORM images . a , Magnified and overlaid graphene - SEM ( white ) and STORM ( green ) images corresponding to Fig . 3ab . b , c , Graphene - SEM ( b ) and STORM ( c ) images corresponding to the boxed area in a . Grid lines are added to aid comparison of the images . Good correlation is generally observed . Local differences in structural details may be partly attributed to insufficient fluorescence labeling of the actin filaments in STORM and non - actin structures that only show up in SEM . a b c 1 µm S5 Supplementary Figure 5 .

Correlated STORM and graphene - SEM results for an unstained wet cell . Live COS - 7 cells were labeled with a DiI cell membrane - labeling solution ( Invitrogen V - 22885 ) at 20 μM in DMEM for 5 min , and then fixed by 4 % paraformaldehyde . a , Graphene - SEM image .

Black and yellow scale bars correspond to scales obtained from graphene - SEM and STORM , respectively . White arrow points to a vesicle that is visualized in both the graphene - SEM and STORM images : This is likely due to the local internalization of the cell membrane ( e . g . , endocytosis ) during dye labeling of the live cell . Meanwhile , many other vesicles are observed in the graphene - SEM image but not in the STORM image : these are likely internal vesicles that are not labeled by the DiI solution . Occasionally observed clusters in the STORM image are attributed to undissolved DiI aggregates . Magenta arrow points to a structure that is visualized in graphene - SEM but barely visible in STORM due to the low labeling of DiI therein . a b c 2 µm 2 µm S7 Supplementary Figure 7 .

Calculation of the normalized cross - correlation of correlated STORM and EM images based on pixel intensity , as a preliminary attempt to evaluate the correspondence between STORM and EM images . a , Calculated for a graphene - encased sample ( Fig . 3a and Fig . 3b ) . A maximal cross - correlation coefficient of 0 . 31 is obtained , which is reasonably good considering the very different contrast mechanisms of STORM and EM . b , Calculated for a control sample without graphene ( boxed areas in Supplementary Fig . 10d and Supplementary Fig . 10e ) . A much lower cross - correlations coefficient ( 0 . 11 ) is obtained due to distortion of the actin network upon dehydration . 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 - 400 - 200 0 200 400 - 400 - 200 0 200 400 nm - 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 Correlation nm 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 - 400 - 200 0 200 400 - 400 - 200 0 200 400 nm - 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 Correlation nm b a S12 Supplementary Figure 12 .
