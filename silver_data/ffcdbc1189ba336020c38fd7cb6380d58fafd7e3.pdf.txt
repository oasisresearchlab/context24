We investigated the role of the integrins c ~ vB3 and c ~ v / ~ 5 in mediating vitronectin adhesion of three phenotypically distinct cell types . M21 human melanoma cells and H2981 lung carcinoma cells use both otv - containing integrins in adhering to vitronectin while UCLA - P3 lung carcinoma cells adhere exclu - sively with otv / ~ 5 . Specifically , monoclonal antibodies directed to functional epitopes on both receptors were required to block adhesion of M21 or H2981 cells while adhesion of UCLA - P3 cells to vitronectin could be blocked with a monoclonal antibody to t ~ v / ~ 5 . Al - though both receptors are involved in M21 and H2981 cell adhesion to vitronectin , only tav / 33 can be detected in focal contacts , colocalizing with vinculin , talin , and the ends of actin filaments , while otv / ~ 5 shows a dis - tinct , nonfocal contact , distribution on the cell surface . These results provide the first evidence that two homol - ogous integrins that recognize the same ligand distrib - ute differentially on the cell surface . I NTEGRINS are a family of heterodimeric proteins respon - sible for a wide variety of cellular adhesive functions involving both cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions . The term integrin was derived from the ability of these pro - teins to link the extracellular environment with the cytoskel - eton ( Hynes , 1987 ) . Numerous reports have documented that cells attach and spread on ligands such as vitronectin , fibronectin , or collagen , and organize their respective integ - rin receptors into focal contacts that form at the end of actin filaments ( Chen et al . , 1985 ; Damsky et al . , 1985 ; Burridge et al . , 1988 ; Singer et al . , 1988 ; Dejana et al . , 1988 ; Carter et al . , 1990 ) . These focal contacts contain not only the ap - propriate integrin but also cytoplasmic proteins such as vin - culin , talin , and ct - actinin ( Geiger , 1979 ; Horwitz et al . , 1986 ; Tapley et al . , 1989 ; Nuckolls et al . , 1990 ; Otey et al . , 1990 ) , which are thought to mediate the interaction between the integrin / ligand structure on the outside of the cell with the actin - contalning microfilaments on the inside of the cell . The functional diversity of integrins is dictated by the par - ticular od ~ subunit composition . However , it is now clear that several integrins with distinct subunit composition rec - ognize the same ligand . For example , or2 , o ~ 3 , and or6 when coupled to the ~ 1 subunit have demonstrated laminin recog - nition capability ( Elices and Hemler , 1989 ; Languino et al . , 1989 ; Gehlsen et al . , 1989 ; Sonnenberg et al . , 1988 ) . Varia - tion of the integrin ot subunit can also give rise to multiple receptors for collagen ( Wayner and Carter , 1987 ; Elices and Hemler , 1989 ) , fibronectin ( Pytela et al . , 1985 ; Wayner et Dr . E . A . Wayner ' s present address is Program in Growth Regulation , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center , 1124 Columbia St . , Seattle , WA 98104 . al . , 1989 ) , and fibrinogen ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a , b ; Smith et al . , 1990a , b ) . Recently , it became evident that the c ~ v subunit was capa - ble of associating with multiple integrin / 3 subunits ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ; Freed et al . , 1989 ; Smith et al . , 1990b ; Kris - sansen et al . , 1990 ; Vogel et al . , 1990 ; Bodary and McLean , 1990 ) . At present there are at least three distinct 13 subunits that associate with otv , namely , / 31 , 133 , and / 35 . Some of these receptors have been shown to bind vitronectin in an Arg - Gly - Asp - dependent manner ( Cberesh et al . , 1989a ; Bodary and McLean , 1990 ) . However , txv / 33 is capable of recognizing multiple Arg - Gly - Asp - containing ligands ( Cheresh and Spiro , 1987 , Smith et al . , 1990a ; Charo et al . , 1990 ) whereas otv / 35 ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a : Smith et al . , 1990a ) and txv / 31 ( Vogel et al . , 1990 ; Bodary and McLean , 1990 ) are clearly more restricted in their adhesive functions . At present it is not clear what , if any , biological signifi - cance can be attributed to the presence of different integrins with similar or identical ligand specificities . It is conceivable that distinct integrins that recognize the same ligand may convey differential signals to the cell . Alternatively , one re - ceptor could be used for adhesion while a second receptor may potentiate cell migration . In this report , we investigated the role of the two vitronec - tin receptors , t ~ v / 33 and av / 35 , in mediating cellular adhesion to vitronectin . Our results demonstrate that while both re - ceptors are involved in the adhesion of a given cell to vitro - nectin , postligand binding events cause these receptors to differentially distribute on the cell surface . Once cells attach and spread on a vitronectin substrate , o ~ v / 33 exclusively asso - ciates with focal contacts and therefore colocalizes with vin - culin and the ends of actin filaments , but ~ v / 35 on the same © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 91 / 05 / 919 / 11 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , Number 4 , May 1991 919 - 929 919 cell does not . This is the first evidence that two integrins on a given cell recognize the same ligand yet differentially seg - regate on the cell surface . These results clearly demonstrate that distinct integrins bound to the same ligand can promote differential posfligand binding events . Materials and Methods Cells and Cell Culture UCLA - P3 human lung carcinoma cells and M21 human melanoma cells were obtained from Dr . Donald Morton ( Department of Surgery , University of California , Los Angeles ) . A549 human lung carcinoma cells were ob - tained from the ATCC . H2981 human lung carcinoma cells were obtained from Dr . Diane Horn ( Oncogen , Seattle , WA ) . Cells were grown in RPMI - 1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and were free of mycoplasma dur - ing the course of these studies . Antibodies mAbs P5H9 and P3G2 ( IgG1 ) directed to the integrin receptor c ~ v / ~ 5 were produced as described by Wayner and Carter ( 1987 ) and Wayner et ai . ( 1988 , 1989 ) . Spleens from RBF / DnJ mice immunized with A549 lung carcinoma cells were removed and fused with NS - 1 / FOX - NY myeloma cells . Hybrid - omas producing antibody directed to carcinoma cell vitronectin receptors were screened by the specific inhibition of UCLA - P3 adhesion to vitronec - tin - coated surfaces and cloned by limiting dilution on thymocyte feeder lay - ers . The resulting monoclonal antibodies , P3G2 ( ave5 ) , PSH9 ( av / 35 ) , and P3G8 ( av ) were used throughout the present studies . Other anti - integrin mAbs used included : LM609 ( c ~ v / 33 ) , LMI42 ( c ~ v ) , LM534 ( / 31 nonfunctional ) , P4C10 ( El functional ) , have been described ( Cheresh and Harper , 1987 ; Cheresh , 1987 ; Carter et ai . , 1990 ) . mAB AP3 ( Newman et al . , 1985 ) to the integrin ~ 3 subunit was a generous gift from Dr . Peter Newman ( Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin , Milwaukee , WI ) . Monoclonal anti - vitronectin , 8E6 ( Hayman et al . , 1983 ) , was a gen - erous gift from Dr . Deane Mosher ( University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI ) . Polyclonai anti - vitronectin was prepared by immunizing rabbits with purified human vitronectin . This reagent did not cross - react with any known adhesive ligand by immunofluorescence or Western blotting . A rabbit poly - clonal antibody raised against a 20 residue peptide ( CTHVDFTFNKFN - KSYNGTVD ) derived from the COOH terminus of / ~ 5 ( Ramaswamy and Hemler , 1990 ) was a gift from Dr . Martin Hemler ( Dana Farber , Boston , MA ) . mAb to the cytoskeletal protein vinculin was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Rabbit anti - talin was generously provided by Dr . Keith Burridge ( University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC ) . All antibodies were purified on protein A - Sepharose . Adhesive Ligands Human plasma fibronectin was prepared as described ( Wayner and Carter , 1987 ) . Collagen type I was obtained from Collaborative Research ( New Bed - ford , MA ) . Vitronectin was prepared as described ( Yatohgo et al . , 1988 ) . Cell Adhesion Assay and Inhibition with Monoclonal Antibodies The cell adhesion assays were performed as previously described ( Wayner and Carter , 1987 ; Wayner et al . , 1988 ; Carter et al . , 1990 ) except that the following buffer was used for the adhesion experiments : RPMI 1640 buffered with Hepes ( Gibco Laboratories , Grand Island , NY ) sup - plemented with 1 % BSA and 1 mM CaCI2 , 1 mM MgC12 , and 100 / ~ M MnCI2 . Briefly , virgin styrene 48 - well plates ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) were coated with adhesive ligands ( 200 / ~ l per well containing 5 ttg / ml ligand ) and were blocked with PBS supplemented with 5 % BSA . Melanoma and carcinoma cells in logarithmic growth were suspended by a 10 - min treatment with versene , washed , resuspended in adhesion buffer and labeled with Na251CrO4 ( 50 t ~ Ci / ml for 30 rain ) . The chromium - labeled cells were allowed to adhere to the protein - coated surfaces for 15 - 30 rain at 37°C in the presence or absence of purified mAbs or ascites fluid to specific adhe - sion receptors diluted 1 : 200 . At the end of the incubation , the nonadherent cells were removed and the adherent ceils were dissolved in SDS / NaOH and bound 51Cr epm were quantitated in a gamma counter . Fluorescence Analysis of Receptor Expression and Localization of Receptors in Focal Adhesions Adherent cells were suspended with versene ( as above ) , washed , and al - lowed to adhere to glass coverslips coated with 10 ~ g / ml fibronectin , colla - gen type I , or vitronectin in the absence of serum for 30 mill at 37°C . After adhesion , the nonadherent cells were removed and the adherent cells were fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde in HBSS for 30 max . They were permeabi - lized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 1 rain , washed , and blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS . The permeabilized cells were stained with antibodies to specific receptors or adhesive ligands ( 60 rain at room temperature ) , washed , in - cubated with either FITC - conjngated goat anti - mouse ( Tago , Inc . , Burlin - game , CA ) or rhodamine - conjngated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Tago , Inc . ) ( 60 min at room temperature ) , and washed again . The coverslips were inverted onto glass slides for fluorescence microscopy as described ( Wayner et al . , 1989 ; Carter et ai . , 1990 ) . The actin - containing cytoskeleton was visual - ized by staining with FITC or rhndamine - conjngated phalloidin diluted 1 : 50 in HBSS containing 1 % BSA ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . Focal adhesions formed during the attachment of cells to vitronectin - coated surfaces were visualized by the exclusion ofa ligand specific antibody from the close con - tacts ( Burridge et ai . , 1988 ; Carter et al . , 1990 ) and by vinculin colocaliza - tion ( Geiger , 1979 ; Burridge et al . , 1988 ) . lmmunoprecipitation Analysis Cells were either surface labeled with 125I or metabolically labeled with 35Scysteine and 35Smethionine as previously described ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ) . Radiolabeled cells were lysed with LCL ( 10 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCI , 1 mM CaC12 , 0 . 02 % NAN3 , pH 8 . 5 ) containing 2 % Renex 30 deter - gent . The lysates were then subjected to immunopreeipitation as previously described ( Cheresh et ai . , 1989a ) . Immunoprecipitated proteins were ana - lyzed by SDS - PAGE under nonreducing conditions on 6 % polyacrylamide gels . Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography as previ - ously described ( Cheresh , 1987 ) . Results Monoclonal Antibody PSH9 Blocks Adhesion of UCLA - P3 to Vitronectin UCLA - P3 lung carcinoma cells express the vitronectin re - ceptor , vfl5 , originally designated as o ~ v / 3x ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ) . mAbs were selected for their ability to block the at - tachment of these cells to vitronectin . As shown in Fig . 1 , mAbs P5H9 and P3G2 ( not shown ) were selected based on their ability to inhibit the adhesion of UCLA - P3 cells to vi - tronectin while not affecting cell attachment to collagen , or fibronectin , mAb LM142 or P3G8 ( not shown ) directed to the o ~ v subunit of this receptor ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ) or mAb LM609 directed to the o ~ vfl3 complex ( Chemsh and Spiro , 1987 ) failed to inhibit UCLA - P3 cell attachment to any of the adhesive ligands ( Fig . 1 ) . In addition , mAb P4C10 , di - rected to a functional epitope on the integrin / 31 subunit , in - hibited attachment of UCLA - P3 cells to collagen but failed to affect cell attachment to vitronectin or fibronectin . These results suggest that mAbs P5H9 and P3G2 recognize the pri - mary vitronectin receptor on UCLA - P3 cells . In a second experiment , we tested various concentrations of purified mAb P5H9 for their ability to block UCLA - P3 adhesion to vitronectin . As shown in Fig . 2 , this mAb inhib - ited cell attachment to vitronectin in a dose - dependent man - ner with half - maximal inhibition at ' ~ 0 . 5 t ~ g / rnl and complete inhibition was obtained at 10 t ~ g / ml . In contrast , mAb LM609 directed to the vitronectin receptor avfl3 ( Cheresh and Spiro , 1987 ) failed to inhibit UCLA - P3 cell attachment at a concen - tration of 100 / zg / ml . These results demonstrate that the mAb P5H9 recognizes the sole vitronectin receptor on UCLA - P3 lung carcinoma cells .

As shown in Fig . 3 ( left , lane C ) , mAb P5H9 immunoprecipitates a heterodimer con - sisting of an cx chain ( 160 kD ) and a B chain ( 95 kD ) under nonreducing conditions . This identical pattern was obtained with rnAb LM142 directed to the otv subunit ( Fig . 3 , lane A ) . In contrast , mAb LM609 , directed to the otv / 33 complex or mAb AP3 , directed to the ~ 3 subunit , failed to immunopre - cipitate any proteins from these cells ( Fig . 3 le ~ , lanes B and D , respectively ) consistent with previous results demonstrat - ing that UCLA - P3 cells lack o ~ vfl3 ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ) . To examine the expression of these receptors on another lung carcinoma cell , H2981 cells were surface labeled and subjected to immunoprecipitation as above . As shown in Fig . Figure 3 .

Integrins c ~ vf33 and ctvf35 Show a Distinct Distribution 921 Figure 4 . mAb P5H9 rec - ognizes the integrin av # 5 . UCLA - P3 cells were surface labeled , extracted with deter - gent , the lysate of which was subjected to immunoprecipi - tation as described in Fig . 3 . However , before immunopre - cipitation , lysates were pre - cleared three times with mAb LM609 ( anti - avB3 , lanes A - D ) , mAb P5H9 ( putative anti - otv / ~ 5 , lane E ) , mAb AP3 ( anti - / ~ 3 , lane F ) or rnAb LM142 ( anti - c ~ v , lane G ) as previously described ( Cheresh et al . , 1989 ) . Immunoprecip - itation of these precleared ly - sates was as follows : lane A , mAb 142 ( anti - t ~ v ) ; lane B , mAb LM609 ( anti - c ~ v / ~ 3 ) ; lanes C , F , and G , mAb P5H9 ( putative anti - otvfl5 ) ; and lanes D and E , polyclonal anti - / 35 . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE on 7 . 5 ( left ) or 6 % ( right ) gels run under nonre - ducing conditions and radio - labeled proteins were visual - ized by autoradiography as described in Fig . 2 . 3 C ( right ) , mAb P5H9 immunoprecipitates a heterodimer identical to that observed from UCLA - P3 cells . However , H2981 cells also express the integrin ctv / 33 ( Fig . 3 right , ar - rows ) since mAbs LM609 ( t ~ v / 33 complex ) and AP3 ( / 33 ) im - munoprecipitate both o ~ v and / 33 from these cells ( Fig . 3 , lanes B and D , respectively ) . Therefore , mAb LM142 directed to the , v subunit immunoprecipitates oe¢ together with / 33 ( arrow ) as well as the / 3 subunit identified by mAb P5H9 . To establish the identity of the heterodimer immunopre - cipitated with mAb P5H9 , UCLA - P3 cell lysates were first subjected to immunodepletion with subunit specific anti - integrin antibodies . This was followed by a second round of immunoprecipitation . AS shown in Fig . 4 ( left ) , the radiola - beled lysate was depleted with mAb P5H9 or LM609 , and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb LM142 , LM609 , P5H9 , or a / 35 - specific antibody ( Ramaswamy and Hemler , 1990 ) . Immunodepletion with mAb P5H9 ( Fig . 4 , lane E ) completely depleted the / 35 immunoreactive mate - rial , whereas depletion with mAb LM609 , directed to the ~ v / 33 complex , did not ( Fig . 4 , lane D ) . AS expected , deple - tion with mAb P5H9 eliminated immunoreactivity with it - self and with mAb LM142 but failed to deplete immunoreac - tivity with a / 31 - specific mAb ( data not shown ) . Moreover , cross - depletion studies using rnAb LM609 and P5H9 on H2981 cell lysates , show absolutely no cross - reactivity be - tween these antibodies ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results indicate that the / 3 subunit immunoprecipitated by mAb P5H9 is / 35 . To identify the ct subunit associated with / 35 on these cells , lysates were first depleted with mAb AP3 ( / 33 ) or mAb LM142 ( c ~ v ) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb P5H9 . As shown in Fig . 4 ( right ) , depletion with mAb LM142 specifically precleared the lysate of P5H9 reactivity whereas depletion with rnAb AP3 failed to do so . These results indicate that the receptor recognized by mAb P5H9 is the integrin c ~ v / 35 . This is consistent with our previous results where we demonstrated that mAb LM142 immuno - precipitated otv / 3x ( otv / 35 ) from UCLA - P3 cells ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ) . That mAb P5H9 completely blocks UCLA - P3 cell adhesion to vitronectin ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) suggests that otv / 35 is the sole vitronectin receptor expressed on these cells . In an attempt to characterize the relative abundance of vitronectin receptors av / 35 and otv / 33 on various cell types , lung carcinoma cell lines UCLA - P3 or H2981 or M21 hu - man melanoma cells were metabolically labeled and sub - jected to immunoprecipitation with mAb P5H9 directed to o0¢ / 35 or mAb LM609 directed to otv / 33 . As shown in Fig . 5 , mAb P5H9 immunoprecipitates a heterodimer from all three cell lines . In contrast , mAb LM609 directed to uv / ~ 3 immunoprecipitates a corresponding heterodimer from M21 and H2981 cells yet fails to identify any protein in UCLA - P3 cells . Therefore these cell lines represent three distinct phenotypes since M21 cells express mostly otv / 33 and mini - mal levels of o ~ v / 35 , H2981 cells express similar levels of both integrins while UCLA - P3 cells express otv / 35 exclusively . Integrins t ~ v ~ 5 and ~ v ~ 3 Are Both Involved in Adhesion of M21 Melanoma and H2981 Carcinoma Cells to lqtronectin To determine whether otv / 35 and otv / 33 are both involved in cell adhesion to vitronectin M21 melanoma and 1 - I2981 car - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 113 , 1991 922 Figure 5 . Immunoprecipitation of c ~ v / $ 3 and c ~ v / $ 5 from metaboli - cally labeled M21 , H2981 , and UCLA - P3 cells . M21 , H2981 , or UCLA - P3 cells were metabolically labeled under steady - state con - ditions ( 18 h ) with [ 35S ] cysteine or [ 35S ] methionine , lysed in deter - gent , and the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb LM609 ( uv / 33 , lane A ) or mAb P5H9 ( ix , v / 35 , lane B ) as de - scribed in Materials and Methods . Samples were analyzed on 6 % polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and visualized by autoradiography as described in Fig . 2 . Arrow refers to the bio - synthetic precursor to c ~ v as previously described ( Cheresh and Harper , 1987 ; Cheresh and Spiro , 1987 ) . cinoma cells were allowed to attach to vitronectin in either the presence or absence of mAb P5H9 and LM609 . As shown in Fig . 6 , neither mAb alone ( 0 . 1 - 25 # g / ml ) com - pletely blocks M21 or H2981 cell adhesion to vitronectin . It is apparent that mAb LM609 significantly reduced the adhesion of M21 cells while mAb P5H9 significantly re - duced the adhesion of H2981 cells . These results are consis - tent with the relative levels of etv / ~ 3 and otv / 35 expressed by these cells ( Fig . 5 ) . However , when these cells were allowed to react with a mixture of mAbs P5H9 and LM609 virtually all M21 cell adhesion to vitronectin was abolished ( Fig . 7 ) . The combined effects of both of these mAbs reduced 1 - 12981 cell adhesion by 80 % ( Fig . 7 ) . As a control , mAb W6 / 32 di - rected to HLA class I antigens present on these ceils failed to inhibit cell adhesion alone or when combined with either vitronectin receptor mAb ( Fig . 7 ) . In addition , mAbs P5H9 or LM609 either separately or together had negligible effects on the adhesion of these cells to fibronectin , collagen or laminin ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that M21 and H2981 cells use both oc , , / ~ 3 and otv / ~ 5 in adhesion to vitronectin .

This staining pattern completely codistrib - utes with focal contacts as detected by these same cells stained with anti - vitronectin ( Fig . 8 A ) . In this case , anti - vitronectin is specifically excluded from the regions of focal contact ( Fig . 8 , A , C , and E , arrows ) and these regions codistribute with the staining pattern of / 33 on M21 cells or H2981 cells ( Fig . 8 , B and D , respectively , arrows ) . In contrast , when H2981 cells are stained with anti - / 35 ( Fig . 8 F ) , a punctate distribution is observed over the entire ventral surface ( Fig . 8 F ) which shows little or minimal colocaiization with focal contacts as depicted by anti - vitronectin exclusion ( Fig . 8 E ) . A composite staining pattern of ~ 3 and / ~ 5 is observed ( Fig . 8 H ) when H2981 are reacted with mAb LM142 directed to the o ~ v subunit on these cells . Thus , it can be clearly seen that the immunolocaiization of the tx , v subunit on these cells reveals both focal contact staining ( identified in Fig . 8 G , arrows ) as well as the punctate nonfocal contact staining pattern .

Radiolabeled M21 cells ( top ) or H2981 cells ( bottom ) were allowed to adhere to wells coated with vitronec - tin as described in Materials and Methods . Cell adhesion was per - formed either in the absence of antibody ( A ) or in the presence 25 # g / ml of the following : mAb W6 / 32 ( B ; anti - HLA , class I ) ; rnAb LM 609 , ( C ; anti - c ~ v / 33 ) ; mAb P5H9 , ( D ; anti - otv / 35 ) ; mAb W6 / 32 + mAb LM609 , ( E ) ; mAb W6 / 32 + mAb P5H9 ( F ) ; or mAb LM609 + mAb P5H9 ( G ) . Data are expressed as the cells attached ( cpm ) to the wells , which in the absence of antibody treat - ment , represents approximately 50 % of the cells added to each well . Each bar represents the mean + SD of triplicates . the same cell is not . As expected , when M21 cells are stained with a mAb directed to vinculin ( Fig . 9 , C ) the focal contacts are detected . This staining pattern shows no colocalization with these same cells stained with the anti - / 35 antibody ( Fig . 9 D ) . As shown in Fig . 9 , G and H , H2981 cells stained with anti - vinculin show the expected focal contact distribution ( arrows ) . When these cells are stained with antibody to talin ( Fig . 9 I ) there is significant colocalization with vinculin ( Fig . 9 H ) but not / 35 ( Fig . 9 , D and F ) . Thus , when cells are attached to vitronectin integrin av / 33 is found in focal contacts colocalizing with vinculin and talin while integrin otv / 35 does not . As a control , we examined the / 33 distribution on H2981 and M21 cells attached to collagen . In this case , the cells did not organize B3 into focal contacts , but as ex - pected mAb LM534 , directed to a nonfunctional epitope on / 31 , located this subunit in focal contacts on collagen ( data not shown ) . These results are consistent with cell adhesion experiments in which rnAb P4C10 , directed to a functional epitope on the / 31 subunit , blocked collagen adhesion of all three cell lines ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that when cells are attached to vitronec - tin , t ~ v / 33 and otv / 35 demonstrate distinct distributions on the , cell surface even though both receptors are clearly involved in the attachment to this ligand . UCLA - P3 cells readily attach to vitronectin but fail to spread and form focal contacts . As shown in Fig . 10 A , the / 35 distribution on these cells shows a similar punctate stain - ing pattern as observed on M21 cells ( Fig . 8 ) and H2981 cells ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) . mAb LM ! 42 , directed to txv or a poly - clonal antibody directed to c ~ v / 33 that react with both recep - tors ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ) on UCLA - P3 cells demonstrate this identical staining pattern confirming the / 35 staining pat - tern on these cells ( data not shown ) . This lack of focal con - tact distribution is correlated with the inability of UCLA - P3 ceils to organize actin during their adhesion to vitronectin ( Fig . 10 B ) . In contrast , M21 cells ( Fig . 10 D ) , or H2981 ( Fig . 10 F ) attached to vitronectin demonstrate well orga - nized actin filaments as depicted on cells stained with rhodamine - phalloidin . As expected the 133 distribution on M21 cells localizes at the ends of actin filaments ( Fig . 10 C , arrows ) whereas 135 on M21 cells ( not shown ) or H2981 cells does not ( Fig . 10 E ) . It is of interest to note that on vitronec - tin - attached H2981 cells the actin filaments appear to orga - nize around the circumference of the ventral cell surface ( Fig . 10 F ) whereas on M21 cells the actin filaments appear to span the diameter of the cell ( Fig . 10 D ) . The distinct localization of / 33 and / 35 on M21 and H2981 cells attached to vitronectin ( as shown above ) were based on experiments in which cells were allowed to attach and spread on vitronectin for 30 min . However , when M21 or H2981 cells were allowed to attach and spread for 120 min we were still unable to observe focal contact distribution of otv / 35 ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that integrin otv / 35 , involved in cell attachment to vitronectin , is incapable of as - sociating with the actin - cytoskeleton and therefore does not localize in focal contacts . Discussion In this report we investigated the mechanism of vitronectin adhesion of three phenotypically distinct cell types : ( a ) M21 melanoma cells which express primarily otvB3 and a smaller amount of ~ xvB5 ; ( b ) H2981 carcinoma cells which express similar levels of o ~ v / 35 and cxvB3 ; and ( c ) UCLA - P3 carci - noma cells which exclusively express oev / 35 ( originally de - fined as integrin otv / 3x Cheresh et al . , 1989a ; Smith et al . , 1990a ) . The M21 and H2981 cells use weB3 and avB5 to adhere and spread on vitronectin whereas UCLA - P3 cells adhere , but fail to spread on this substrate . Although otv / 33 and < xvB5 are required for optimal adhe - sion of M21 and H2981 cells , these receptors distribute to Figure 8 . Immunofluorescence detection of c ~ v / 33 and c ~ v / 35 on the surface of M21 and H2981 cells . M21 ( A and B ) of H2981 ( C - H ) cells were allowed to attach and spread on vitronectin - coated coverslips for 30 - 45 min at 37°C , after which cells were fixed , permeabilized , and reacted with primary antibodies to vitronectin , either mAb 8E6 ( A and C ) or rabbit anti - vitronectin antibody ( E and G ) . Localization of 133 ( B and D ) or / 35 ( F ) on these cells was achieved using the primary antibodies mAb AP3 and rabbit anti - / 35 peptide , respectively . The composite staining of both receptors was identified by mAb LM142 directed to ~ xv ( H ) . These antigens were detected with Frl ' C - conjugated anti - mouse or rhodamine - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG . Arrows indicate focal contact staining as defined by anti - vitronectin exclu - sion in A , C , E , and G .

Thus , after adhesion of M21 or H2981 cells , all detectable surface - associated c ~ v / 33 is localized to focal contacts whereas o ~ v / 35 is not . Instead , otv / 35 appears in a punctate distribution over much of the ventral cell surface . UCLA - P3 cells , which ex - clusively use otv / 35 to attach to vitronectin , also show a simi - lar nonfocal distribution . In fact , in none of the three cell lines examined did c ~ v / 35 localize to the ends of actin fila - ments or associate with vinculin . These results suggest one of two possibilities . Either the / 35 subunit is unable to associ - ate with these cytoskeletal proteins or is unable to mobilize them into focal contacts . This is of interest since previous studies demonstrated that both integrins recognize vitronec - tin in an Arg - Gly - Asp - dependent manner ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ) . These results suggest that distinct localization of these two receptors is not a consequence of a major differ - ence in their ligand binding capability . Of the three cell lines we examined , M21 exhibited the greatest degree of spreading on vitronectin , while H2981 cells had a moderate capacity to spread and UCLA - P3 cells failed to do so . Consistent with these morphological obser - vations , immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that M21 cells expressed a high ctv / 33 / / 35 ratio whereas H2981 cells revealed a relatively low otv / 33 / / 35 ratio and UCLA - P3 cells express only ~ v / 35 . By comparison , M21 cells spread considerably less on collagen indicating that these cells are not simply more capable of spreading in general . However , it should be pointed out that like M21 cells , UCLA - P3 cells use a / 31 - containing integrin to attach to collagen ( Fig . 1 ) , yet UCLA - P3 cells were unable to significantly spread on collagen or vitronectin suggesting the failure of these cells to spread on vitronectin is not entirely due to their exclusive expression of otv / 35 as a vitronectin receptor . Although cell spreading is a complex molecular event , it is conceivable that the failure of otv / 35 to associate with the actin - cytoskeleton may render this receptor incapable of inducing cell spread - ing on a vitronectin substrate . Thus , in order to spread on vitronectin , cells may require surface expression of txv / 33 , which is capable of promoting the organization of the actin - cytoskeleton in order to spread . Our inability to localize otv / 35 to focal contacts is some - what surprising in light of previous published reports which have demonstrated both / 31 and / 33 integrin association with focal contacts . When cells are attached to fibronectin , colla - gen , and laminin , integrins containing the 131 subunit have been localized to focal contacts ( Singer et al . , 1988 ; Wayner et al . , 1989 ; Carter et al . , 1990 ) , whereas on vitronectin / 33 was localized to focal contacts ( Singer et al . , 1988 ) . These results suggest that integrins direct the organization of cy - toskeletal components in response to specific and relevant ligands . This is biologically important since redistribution of integrins into focal contacts causes cells to change shape in response to cytoskeletal rearrangements . These shape changes may affect cellular signaling and the migratory or proliferative capacity of the cell . Thus , the relative expres - sion of av / 35 and / or av / 33 on a cell surface may have pro - found effects on the biological behavior of that cell in the presence of vitronectin . In this study , the immunolocalization of otv / 35 on vitronec - tin - attached cells was performed using a polyclonal antibody directed to a 20 residue synthetic peptide derived from the COOH terminus of 135 ( Ramaswamy and Hemler , 1990 ) . It is conceivable that such an antibody might be sterically in - hibited when the 135 subunit is associated with the actin - cytoskeleton . In such a case one would expect selective ex - clusion of staining at the sites of focal contact formation . However , this is not the case , rather , the staining with the / 35 antibody is punctate over most , if not all , of the ventral sur - face of all three cell lines . It is also unlikely that all epitopes represented by a polyclonal antibody directed to a peptide of 20 residues would be sterically unable to recognize / 35 in as - sociation with the actin - cytoskeleton , when a polyclonal an - tibody prepared to a cytoplasmic peptide from 131 does local - ize within focal contacts ( Marcantonio and Hynes , 1988 ) . Moreover , staining these cells with a polyclonal antibody to av / 33 or a mAb to ocv , either of which will recognize both receptors ( Cheresh et al . , 1989a ; Smith et al . , 1990a ) , dem - onstrates the composite 133 and / 35 staining pattern of M21 and H2981 and the exclusive / 35 staining pattern on UCLA - P3 cells . It is likely that the distinct distribution of t ~ v / 33 and otv / 35 is attributable to a structural difference between the / 3 sub - units since both receptors share a common o ~ subunit . The primary amino acid sequence of / 33 ( Fitzgerald et al . , 1987 ) and / 35 ( Ramaswamy and Hemler , 1990 ; Suzuki et al . , 1990 ; McLean et al . , 1990 ) show 56 % identity . However , / 35 con - tains a cytoplasmic domain that is distinct from that of / 33 . In fact , the cytoplasmic domain of / 35 is only 10 - 20 % ho - mologous to / 33 or the other integrin / 3 subunits ( Ramaswamy and Hemler , 1990 ) . Moreover , / 35 contains a 10 residue car - boxy - terminal extension not found on / 33 or any of the known integrin / 3 subunits . Since the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin / 31 subunit has been implicated in focal contact formation ( Solowska et al . , 1989 ; Hayashi et al . 1990 ) it is conceivable that the unique cytoplasmic portion of 135 prevents its associ - ation with the actin - cytoskeleton . Alternatively , txv / 35 might preferentially associate with cytoplasmic proteins other than the actin - cytoskeleton such as intermediate filaments . In ei - ther event , this would likely result in the failure of this re - ceptor to localize in focal contacts even though it maintains contact with its ligand . A similar model has been proposed for the integrin ot6 / 34 ( Suzuki and Naitoh , 1990 ; Tamura et al . , 1990 ) . This integrin has an unusually long cytoplasmic tail not found on any other integrin / 3 subunits and also fails to enter focal contacts probably due to its association with intermediate filaments ( Quaranta , V . , personal communica - tion ) . In epithelial tissues tx6 / 34 exclusively localizes to the basolateral surface whereas the 131 subunlt is uniformly ex - pressed on the entire cell surface ( Carter et al . , 1990 ) . The results presented in our study provide the first evi - Figure 9 . c ~ v135 and c ~ v133 expressed on M21 and H2981 cells demonstrate distinct distributions . M21 ( A - D ) or H2981 ( E - I ) cells attached to vitronectin coated coverslips were stained as in Fig . 8 , except the primary antibodies used were mAb AP3 directed to t33 ( A and E ) , rabbit anti - 135 ( B , D , and F ) , mAb directed to vinculin ( C , G , and H ) , or rabbit anti - talin ( I ) .

This dis - tinct distribution can be accounted for by differential associa - tion with the actin - cytoskeleton . Therefore , two integrins that bind the same ligand can provide distinct cellular sig - nals . Future experiments are aimed at elucidating these sig - nals at the molecular level and determining their consequence in terms of cellular differentiation and proliferation .
