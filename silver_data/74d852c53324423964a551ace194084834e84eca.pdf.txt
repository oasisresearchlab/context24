ARTICLE doi : 10 . 1038 / nature10441 The crystal structure of dynamin Marijn G . J . Ford 1 , Simon Jenni 2 & Jodi Nunnari 1 Dynamin - related proteins ( DRPs ) are multi - domain GTPases that function via oligomerization and GTP - dependent conformational changes to play central roles in regulating membrane structure across phylogenetic kingdoms . How DRPs harness self - assembly and GTP - dependent conformational changes to remodel membranes is not understood . Here we present the crystal structure of an assembly - deficient mammalian endocytic DRP , dynamin 1 , lacking the proline - rich domain , in its nucleotide - free state . The dynamin 1 monomer is an extended structure with the GTPase domain and bundle signalling element positioned on top of a long helical stalk with the pleckstrin homology domain flexibly attached on its opposing end . Dynamin 1 dimer and higher order dimer multimers form via interfaces located in the stalk . Analysis of these interfaces provides insight into DRP family member specificity and regulation and provides a framework for understanding the biogenesis of higher order DRP structures and the mechanism of DRP - mediated membrane scission events . Dynamin - related proteins ( DRPs ) belong to a highly conserved ( Sup - plementary Fig . 1 ) GTPase superfamily that catalyses diverse mem - braneremodellingevents 1 , 2 . MembranescissionDRPsincludedynamin 1 , which catalyses clathrin - coated vesicle scission at the plasma mem - brane and Drp1 / Dnm1 , which divide mitochondria . Despite their functional diversity , all DRPs undergo GTP cycle - dependent con - formational changes to regulate self - assembly and disassembly 3 – 8 . DRP architecture includes an amino - terminal GTPase domain , a bundle signalling element ( BSE ) , a middle domain ( MD ) and a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) 9 , 10 . Many DRPs also have a variable region between the MD and GED ; in dynamin 1 , this is a pleckstrin homologydomain ( PH ) that binds tophosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bispho - sphate ( PtdIns - 4 , 5 - P 2 ) - containing membranes to facilitate targeting and possibly membrane remodelling via membrane insertion 11 – 14 . AssembledDRPscanformhelicalstructures invitro 15 , 16 . Withinthese structures , GTP cycle - driven conformational changes result in mem - brane remodelling 4 , 5 , 7 , 17 . The structural basis for DRP self - assembly and GTPcycle - dependentconformationalchangesarenotfullyunderstood . The mechanism of assembly has been informed by the structure of the ‘stalk’ of MxA , a distantly related DRP , in which the MD and part of the GED form an extended helical bundle that mediates self - assembly via conservedinterfaces 18 . Severalstructures have alsoprovidedinsightinto DRP GTP cycle conformational changes ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) 19 – 24 . Cryo - electron microscopic structures of assembled dynamin in guano - sine - 5 9 - [ ( b , c ) - methyleno ] triphosphate ( GMPPCP ) - bound and nucleo - tide - free states have provided models for the assembled oligomers and the location of the GTPase and PH domains within the helical struc - tures 17 , 25 . However , to understand the basis of DRP self - assembly and mechanism , the architecture of DRP domains within a single molecule must beelucidated . Here , we report the crystal structureof anassembly - deficient dynamin 1 in the nucleotide - free state that lacks only the unstructured carboxy - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) . G397D , an assembly - deficient dynamin 1 mutant The propensity of DRPs to assemble has been an obstacle to obtaining crystals suitable for diffraction experiments . We identified the muta - tion G436D , an invariant MD residue , in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial division DRP Dnm1 , by screening for mutations that possessed the same phenotype as assembly - deficient Dnm1 G385D , specifically mutations that shifted Dnm1 – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion from a punctate to a more diffuse localization pattern in yeast cells 16 . We expressed and purified ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) the orthologous rat dynamin 1 mutant protein lacking the PRD ( Dyn1 G397D D PRD ) and examined its ability to self assemble using light scattering ( Fig . 1a ) . Addition ofGMPPCPcaused anincreaseinscatter - inginDyn1 D PRDsamples , butcausednochangeinscatteringin Dyn1 G397D D PRD samples . Using a combination of size - exclusion chro - matography and sucrose gradient centrifugation 26 , Dyn1 D PRD and Dyn1 G397D D PRD were estimated to be dimeric ( Supplementary Fig . 3b and Supplementary Table 1 ) under non - assembly conditions , similar to other assembly - deficient DRP mutants 16 , 27 . Under assembly conditions , we observed an increase in the sedimentation coefficient of Dyn1 D PRD , butnotforDyn1G397D D PRD ( SupplementaryTable1 ) . Dyn1G397D D PRDwasdefectiveforassembly - stimulatedGTPhydro - lysis ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Table 2 ) and failed to assemble into helical structures on phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns - 4P ) - containing lipid nanotubes , in contrast to Dyn1 D PRD ( Fig . 1c ) . Dyn1 G397D D PRD was also soluble at higher concentrations than Dyn1 D PRD . Together , these data indicate that the G397D mutation severely hampers dynamin self assembly and substantiates the critical role of the MD in intermolecular interactions 16 , 18 , 27 – 29 . Given these characteristics , it presented an attractive target for crystallization . Crystallization and structure of Dyn1 G397D D PRD We obtained orthorhombic crystals of Dyn1 G397D D PRD that dif - fracted to a minimum Bragg spacing of 3 . 1 A˚ ( Methods and Supplementary Table 3 ) . The structure was solved by molecular replacement , using the nucleotide - free rat dynamin 1 GTPase domain , the human dynamin 1 PH and a portion of the human MxA stalk , as sequential search models ( Methods ) 11 , 13 , 18 , 30 . We traced the complete model , except for some disordered loops , and assigned amino acids after refinement of the molecular replacement solution . The model was refined to R / R free values of 0 . 21 / 0 . 27 . A representative example of the B - sharpened likelihood - weighted 2 mF obs 2 DF calc electron density map is shown in Fig . 2c . Dyn1 G397D D PRD forms an extended structure with the GTPase and PH domains separated by a stalk consisting of an anti - parallel helical bundle of the MD and a helix from the GED ( Fig . 2a , b ) .

All rights reserved ©2011 contrast , the distantly related bacterial dynamin - like protein ( BDLP ) is compactly folded in its nucleotide - free and GDP - bound states ( Sup - plementary Fig . 2a ) , with its ‘paddle’ , in an analogous region to the PH domainofdynamin , incloseproximitytotheGTPasedomain 19 , 20 . Thus , unlike BDLP , GTP binding in dynamin is not harnessed to form an extendedstructure , consistentwithnucleotide - independentassemblyof dynaminonliposomes 4 , 8 , 31 , 32 . Linkersconnecting theMDtothe PHand the PH to the GED are disordered , indicating a flexibly tethered PH . Thus , any of three crystallographic symmetry - related PH domains could connect to the remainder of the structure ( Fig . 2d ) . The probable PH partner , based on the fit with the envelope of an assembly - deficient dynamindimer determinedbysmall - angleX - rayscattering 33 ( SAXS ) , is shown in Fig . 2b . The structure of the PH is similar to those previously determined 11 , 13 , with expected differences concentrated in the variable loops . The structure of the GTPase domain is similar to that of the previ - ously determined nucleotide - free dynamin GTPase domain struc - ture 30 . There are minor expected changes in the poorly resolved switch 2 region , the dynamin - specific loop and in the loop connecting the N GTPase to the GTPase domain . The C GTPase helix is kinked at the conserved proline 294 and , together with the N GTPase helix and a helix at the C terminus of the GED ( C GED ) , forms the three - helix BSE 9 . C GED covers a groove of 937 A ˚ 2 between the N GTPase and C GTPase helices . In the nucleotide - free dynamin 1 GTPase and the GDP - bound Dictyostelium discoideum dynamin A GTPase structures , a myosin peptide substitutes for C GED , indicating the importance of this interface for GTPase domain stability 30 , 34 . A linker with elevated crystallographic temperature factors con - nects the C GTPase to the dynamin stalk ( Fig . 2a , b ) and contains two prolines ( 319 and 322 ) , whose equivalents in the distantly related DRP atlastin 1 connect the GTPase and MD ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Although the dynamin stalk sequence shares limited identity to MxA , its overall structure is similar and the MxA nomenclature is retained 18 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . As for MxA , helix a 1 is split by a disordered loop , L1 . The remainder of a 1 diverges from MxA and is split into two helices , termed a 1 C1 and a 1 C2 . Helix a 1 C2 connects to helix a 2 via a short disordered loop , L2 . Helices a 2 and a 3 run the length of the stalk and are joined by a short loop , L3 . The stalk is completed by GED - derived helix a 4 that spans the stalk and connects to C GED via a linker . Following helix a 3 is a coil that folds across a 4 that is strongly conserved in dynamins , Drp1s and Dnm1 , but absent in MxA . The dynamin – dimer interface The crystal lattice contains linear filaments of dynamin assembled via three stalk interfaces , similar to MxA 18 , resulting in layers of interact - ing stalks separated by GTPase and PH domains ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Interface 2 , the largest with a buried surface of 1 , 339 A ˚ 2 , has two - fold symmetry and is formed by residues from stalk helices a 4 and a 3 ( Fig . 3c ) , with an additional residue from a 1 C1 ( H367 ) . Each protomer in the inter - face contributes seven direct hydrogen bonds and eight hydrophobic residues line the site of contact between a 3 and a 4 ( Fig . 3c ) . Interface 2 sequence conservation indicates a mechanism for dimer specificity within the DRP superfamily . Phylogenetic analysis of the hydrogen bonding partners within this region in dynamins , Drp1s and Dnm1 , and Mx proteins allowed us to categorize three classes of residues : conserved in dynamins , Drp1 / Dnm1 , and Mx proteins ( in a GTPase Middle PH GED PRD 864 743 628 496 274 b c d α 1 N α 1 C1 α 1 C2 α 2 α 3 α 4 N GTPase C GTPase VL2 L1 loop C GTPase 317 L2 loop C GED N GTPase 23 GTPase VL3 PH L3 loop Figure 2 | The crystal structure of Dyn1 G397D D PRD . a , Schematic of the Dyn1 domainstructure .

Plotting these classes onto a surface representation of the dynamin monomer ( Fig . 3e ) indicates that dimerization specificity is controlled by a spatial combinatorial code . As predicted from this code , hetero - oli - gomers consisting of dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 are observed 35 . Several residues contributing to the apparent specificity are localized in the strongly conserved coil of dynamin , Drp1 and Dnm1 that follows a 3 . Dynamin stalk interfaces drive self assembly Interfaces 1 and 3 are also stalk - localized and mediate higher order assembly of dynamin dimers ( Fig . 3a ) . Interface 1 is at the tips of interacting stalks , proximal to the GTPase domain and BSE ( Fig . 3f ) and is formed through interactions between protomer helices a 4 and a 1 N . The interface is capped by a stacking interaction between opposing and flexible Y706 residues , conserved in dynamins and Drp1s . Interface 1 includes four hydrogen bonds ( Fig . 3f , dashed green lines ) , with the remainder consisting of hydrophobic residues . The buried surface area of interface 1 is relatively small ( 624 A˚ 2 ) and is likely to be dynamic to tolerate protomer interactions in a range of orientations . Interface 3 is at the distal end of the stalk , where L2 loops from symmetry - related molecules are in close proximity ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . The G397D mutation is within L2 , which could not be traced due to poor density . The N - terminal region of L2 is also in close proximity to a symmetry - related L1 , which features a highly con - served glycine , G346 , that when mutated in Dnm1 ( G385D ) blocks assembly beyond the dimer 16 . We therefore predict that G397 and G346 are near one another in assembled dynamin .

All rights reserved ©2011 MxA also inhibit assembly and stabilize dimeric forms 18 , 27 . In con - trast , disruption of MxA interface 1 yields a mixture of dimers and tetramers 18 . Thus , our data indicate that interface 3 is critical at an early step in the dynamin assembly pathway asits disruption stabilizes dimeric dynamin and allows linear filament formation . In contrast , interface 1 interactions probably function only to stabilize oligomer - ization . From our structure , we propose that the dynamin dimer interface 2 is constitutive and relatively rigid . As compared to linear arrangement in the crystal , in helical assemblies we propose that the necessary rotational and translational shifts occur between adjacent dimers at interfaces 1 and 3 ( Fig . 4a ) . Indeed , stalk dimers fit into the GMPPCP - bound helical electron microscopic reconstruction of dynamin 25 ( Fig . 4b ) possess a more tightly packed interface 3 and interface 1 . These differences can be attributed to the disordered interface 3 in the crystal that is probably due to steric hindrance from the G397D mutation , and the dynamic nature of the hydrophobic interface 1 . Regulation of DRPs ThedynaminPHisessentialforendocytosisandinteractswithinositol phospholipids with low affinity 12 , 36 . Centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) disease mutations cluster at the C terminus of the PH a - helix ( Sup - plementary Fig . 5a ) , underscoring its importance . They cause an increase in basal GTPase activity , without altering interactions with inositol phospholipids 33 . In addition , SAXS analysis of an assembly - deficient dynamin indicates that the CNM mutants have a different conformationcomparedtowildtype 33 , 37 . Inourlattice , threePHdomains related by crystallographic symmetry lie close to interface 3 and the L1 loop ( Fig . 2d ) , suggesting an interaction . Thus , the PH may serve to regulate access to this key multimerization interface to couple dynamin membrane interactions to dynamin assembly . Phosphoinositide binding by the PH variable loops and penetration of the membrane by variable loop 1 14 could help to expose dynamin interface 3 and / or L1 and thus promote multimerization . Alignment of the dynamin PH and corresponding sequences from Drp1s shows conservation of key residues ( Supplementary Figs 1 and 5b ) , indicating that lipids may similarly regulate mammalian mito - chondrial division . However , mammalian Drp1s lack most of the C - terminal PH a - helix , including residues mutated in CNM . The details of Drp1 interface 3 regulation may therefore be different . Consistently , Drp1 splice variants have deletions in this region , point - ing to a potential regulatory role . By contrast , Danio rerio Drp1 and fungal Dnm1 have an insert B of unknown structure in this region . Mitochondrial division DRPs can therefore be subdivided on this basis , which correlates with the divergence of their corresponding effectors , yeast Mdv1 and mammalian Mff 38 , 39 . Discussion Our structure provides insight into the mechanism and regulation of dynamin assembly and into how the dynamin GTPase cycle is harnessed for function . Several observations point to a key role of the dynamin BSE in the formation of the GTPase – GTPase dimer interface observed in the GTPase – C GED GDP N AlF 4 2 crystal struc - ture 10 . Thisinterfaceislikelytoformfromadjacentrungsofa dynamin helix and is critical to dynamin function as it mediates assembly - stimulated GTP hydrolysis . Comparison of the GTPase – GTPase dimer with our nucleotide - free structure indicates that in addition to expected differences , the BSE is flexible . Dynamin genetic data also support a role for the BSE in the regulation of GTPase – GTPase inter - face formation . Specifically , thedynaminswitch 2 shibire ts2mutation , G146S , which causes endocytic intermediates with ‘collared’ dynamin necks to accumulate 40 , is suppressed by the sushi mutation A738T 41 , 42 , located in the C GED peptide , facing the hydrophobic groove ( Fig . 5a ) . Insight into how dynamin undergoes conformational changes also comes from distantly related DRP structures ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . GTP - dependent GTPase domain dimerization is also observed for guanylate binding protein , indicating that this may be a common feature of the DRP superfamily 22 ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . In addition , two recent structures of the atlastin 1 cytosolic domain , thought to representpre - andpost - endoplasmicreticulummembranefusioncon - formations 23 , 24 , indicate that large changes occur in the position of the 3 - helix bundle ‘middle domain’ relative to the GTPase domain ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . We propose that GTP binding and self - assembly promote dynamin GTPase – GTPase dimer formation via an opening of the BSE relative to the GTPase domain . In support , a modified version of our structure can be fit into the cryo - electron microscopic reconstruction of GMPPCP - bound dynamin with the BSE in a substantially more open Shift Tilt a Interface 1 2 . 0 Å 2 . 0 Å Crystal Interface 3 x z Pitch = 94 Å 13 . 2 subunits per turn Dynamin helix x z 27º 3 . 6º x z Cross section Side view Expansion c b 90º Longitudinal section Inside view 180º Kink Flexible loop 70º BSE GTPase 50º GTPasedimer BSE Interface 1 BSE Figure 4 | Oligomerization of dynamin into helical structures . a , Dynamin helices derived from the linear arrangement in our crystal structure .

We obtained a good fit of the GTPase – GTPase dimer domains and stalk interface 1 using constraints dictated bythehelicalfitoftheoligomericstalkandthestrongGTPasedomain - derived density ( Fig . 4b ) .

Consistently , superposition of GDP N AlF 4 2 GTPase – C GED fusion GTPase – GTPase dimer partners indicates a smaller yet directionally equivalent opening of the BSE in one proto - mer 10 . This proposed conformational change is feasible as there are relatively few contacts that hold the N GTPase helix to the body of the GTPasedomaininourstructure . Inaddition , theBSElinkstheGTPase domain to the stalk and interface 1 via a short turn , making it well placed to transmit conformational alterations . As previously noted , comparison of the nucleotide - free and GMPPCP - bound electron microscopic reconstructions indicates that the GMPPCP - bound helix hasarelativelysmallerdiameter 17 . Inaddition , thestalkdensityismore ‘kinked’ in the GMPPCP - bound form 17 . When we dock our structure , we observed that the bases of the stalks do not fit the density of the GMPPCP - bound helix . However , where the fit becomes poor there are strongly conserved prolines in a 2 and a 4 and a partially conserved proline in a 1 C1 clustered in the stalk . We propose that these proline residues facilitate the formation of a kink at the stalk base in the GMPPCP - bound helix , which might allow interface 1 to form more fully in the assembled helix . As predicted by our model , GTP hydrolysis would induce closure of the BSE via a transition state represented by the structure of the GTPase domain – BSE fusion in the presence of GDP N AlF 4 2 , towards the conformation observed in our nucleotide - free structure ( Fig . 5b ) . As GTP binding to dynamin is not rate limiting and GTP hydrolysis is stimulated by the formation of the GTPase – GTPase interface between adjacent rungs , it is likely that the BSE - dependent conformational changeoccursinthecontextofshortdynaminhelicalassembliesratherthanwithinahelixconsistingofmanyrungs 8 , 32 . Shortassembliescould also result in an approximate temporally coordinated conformational change ( Fig . 5c – e ) . The conformational changes we propose would cause disruption to the assembled helix and the underlying membrane via local rung shifts . Interface 1 in our structure , which buries a rela - tively small surface area in the assembledstalk lattice , willbe especially susceptible tochange by inter - rungGTPase – GTPasedimer formation and its subsequent disruption by GTP hydrolysis , and these changes will be transmitted to interface 3 and the PH . The combined effects of curvature stress imposed by a short dynamin helical assembly coupled with PH insertion into the membrane is likely to destabilize the mem - brane and result in membrane fission 14 . Given the strong similarities between dynamins and other DRP family members , the structure of dynamin and our proposed model will serve to guide studies on the mechanisms of action of DRPs in diverse cellular functions . METHODS SUMMARY The conserved Dyn1 D PRD assembly - defective mutant G397D was identified by a cytological assay using the yeast mitochondrial fission DRP Dnm1 – GFP . Dyn1 D PRD and Dyn1 G397D D PRD were expressed in E . coli and were purified as described in Methods . Light scattering , sucrose density gradient centrifugation , mass determination , continuous GTPase assays and electron microscopy were performed as described in Methods . Crystals were grown by microbatch from 3 . 2 m l droplets containing 52 . 5mM Tris / Cl pH 7 . 7 , 175mM NaCl , 32 . 5mM NaNO 3 , 20 % v / v PEG 400 , 0 . 97mM b - mercaptoethanol and 31 . 9 m M Dyn1 G397D D PRD and cryo - protected with Paretone - N . Reflection data were col - lected at 100K at Beamline 8 . 3 . 1 at the Advanced Light Source ( Berkeley , California , USA ) at a wavelength of 0 . 9488A˚ . Data collection and processing are described in Methods . The structure was determined by molecular replace - ment , using known structures of the nucleotide - free rat dynamin 1 GTPase domain ( PDB accession no . 2AKA chain B ) , the human dynamin 1 PH domain ( PDBaccessionno . 2DYNchainB ) andatruncatedformofthehumanMxAstalk ( PDB accession no . 3LJB chain B ) as sequential search models . Structure refine - ment is described in Methods . The stalk interface 2 dimer was fit into the previ - ously described cryo - electron microscopic reconstruction of GMPPCP - bound dynamin by applying tilt and twist to the sequential dimers from the linear filaments observed in the crystal to match the helical parameters described for the reconstruction . The previously described GTPase domain dimer formed in the presence of GDP N AlF 4 2 was subsequently fit into the density . Connection of the GTPase domain to the stalk required a conformational rearrangement of the BSE , which was independently fit into the visible density . The fit was subjected to rigid body refinement as described in Methods .
