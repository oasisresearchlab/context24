Design Two - group randomized controlled trial . Setting World Wide Web in England and Republic of Ireland . Participants A total of 3971 subjects who purchased a particular brand of nicotine patch and logged - on to use a free web - based behavioral support program . Intervention Web - based tailored behavioral smoking cessation materials or web - based non - tailored materials . Measurements Twenty - eight - day continuous abstinence rates were assessed by internet - based survey at 6 - week follow - up and 10 - week continuous rates at 12 - week follow - up . Findings Using three approaches to the analyses of 6 - and 12 - week outcomes , participants in the tailored condition reported clinically and statistically sig - niﬁcantly higher continuous abstinence rates than participants in the non - tailored condition . In our primary analyses using as a denominator all subjects who logged - on to the treatment site at least once , continuous abstinence rates at 6 weeks were 29 . 0 % in the tailored condition versus 23 . 9 % in the non - tailored condition ( OR = 1 . 30 ; P = 0 . 0006 ) ; at 12 weeks continuous abstinence rates were 22 . 8 % versus 18 . 1 % , respectively ( OR = 1 . 34 ; P = 0 . 0006 ) . More - over , satisfaction with the program was signiﬁcantly higher in the tailored than in the non - tailored condition . Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate a beneﬁt of the web - based tailored behavioral support materials used in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy . A web - based program that collects relevant information from users and tailors the intervention to their speciﬁc needs had signiﬁcant advantages over a web - based non - tailored cessation program . KEYWORDS Internet , smoking cessation , nicotine replacement therapy , tailoring , web . INTRODUCTION Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world ( World Health Organization 2002 ) 7 . Because of the lag between smok - ing onset and disease occurrence , only cessation of smok - ing by current adult smokers is likely to yield reductions in mortality within the next 25 years ( Doll et al . 1994 ) . Ideally , smoking cessation programs should have the potential of reaching a large number of smokers , be easy to adopt , be effective , have good ﬁdelity ( preserve the pro - gram’s original effectiveness during the implementation Web - based computer - tailored smoking cessation program and NRT 683 © 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction , 100 , 682 – 688 phase ) and be easy to maintain over time ( Glasgow et al . 1992 ) . Most current antismoking efforts have been unable to offer all of these characteristics . Mass media approaches have wide reach but low effectiveness ( Lich - tenstein & Glasgow 1992 ) . On the other hand , intensive multi - session clinical interventions can achieve up to 28 % long - term cessation rates ( Fiore et al . 2000 ) , but their reach is limited ( Schmid , Jeffrey & Hellerstedt 1989 ; Fiore et al . 1990 ; Wagner et al . 1990 ) . Computer - based communication technologies hold the promise of combining the beneﬁts of high - reach media - based interventions , individually orientated clin - ics and popular self - help programs . With the rapid devel - opment of such technology , tailoring a cessation program to the speciﬁc needs and interests of the smoker has become increasingly more sophisticated and less expen - sive ( de Vries & Brug 1999 ; Strecher 1999 ) . Tailoring requires an assessment of a person’s individual charac - teristics , as opposed to targeting , which is based on broader group identiﬁcation ( e . g . gender ) ( Kreuter , Stre - cher & Glassman 1999 ; Strecher 1999 ) . Tailoring is typ - ically undertaken using computer programs that attempt to use rules for problems ordinarily requiring an expert . A commonly used program consists of : ( a ) an assessment of individual characteristics relevant to smoking cessation , ( b ) algorithms that use these data to generate interven - tions tailored to the speciﬁc needs of the user and ( c ) a feedback protocol that delivers these messages to the smoker in a clear , vivid form . A generally positive body of evidence demonstrates the efﬁcacy of print - based computer - tailored smoking cessation interventions in adults ( Strecher 1999 ; Lan - caster & Stead 2002 ) , and two trials have found higher cessation rates as a result of adding a tailored print - based program ( ‘Committed Quitters TM ’ ) to nicotine gum or patch pharmacotherapy ( Shiffman et al . 2000 , 2001 ) . A key question is whether the effects of tailoring can be transferred to an even less costly , potentially high - reach channel , the World Wide Web . To our knowledge there are no published , randomized controlled trials of web - based smoking cessation programs ( Lancaster & Stead 2002 ) . The present study represents the ﬁrst study of this kind . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects Subjects for the study were recruited from smokers in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland who purchased NiQuitin CQ 21 mg patch and connected to a website to enroll for free behavioral support materials . Eligible enrollees were required to meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) had a target quit date that was within 7 days from the enrollment date ; ( 2 ) provided a valid e - mail address and had internet access for the duration of the study ; ( 3 ) were attempting to quit smoking cigarettes ( i . e . not smokeless tobacco ) ; ( 4 ) had been smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day ; ( 5 ) had purchased NiQuitin CQ 21 mg ( 21 mg of nicotine , indicated for those who smoke at least 10 ciga - rettes per day ) ; ( 6 ) agreed to be contacted for follow - up e - mail and web - based questionnaires at 6 and 12 weeks ; and ( 7 ) were 18 years of age or older . Eligible enrollees were invited to participate in the study ; among those invited , 76 . 8 % agreed to participate . A total of 3971 subjects completed the baseline ques - tionnaire and were randomized to one of two treatment conditions . Within 24 hours of completing the baseline questionnaire , all subjects were notiﬁed by e - mail that they had access to their behavioral support internet site . The majority of subjects were women ( 56 . 5 % ) ; the aver - age age was 36 . 9 years ( SD = 10 . 2 ) . Subjects smoked an average of 23 . 5 cigarettes per day ( SD = 8 . 2 ) and had smoked for an average of 20 . 1 years ( SD = 10 . 3 ) . The large majority of subjects ( 88 . 4 % ) smoked their ﬁrst cig - arette of the day within the ﬁrst 30 minutes after waking . Treatment conditions Enrollees were assigned randomly to one of two web - based treatment conditions : the active CQ PLAN or non - tailored web - based smoking cessation materials . Partici - pants were not informed of their treatment assignment . There were no signiﬁcant differences in demographic or smoking history characteristics between subjects ran - domized to the CQ PLAN and control condition . Web - based Committed Quitters TM Stop Smoking Plan ( CQ PLAN ) Information collected in the enrollment questionnaire was used to tailor the CQ PLAN materials ( HealthMedia , Inc . , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) , including : demographics , smoking history , motives for quitting , expected difﬁculties quitting and situations that were expected to present challenges . In addition , subjects were allowed to identify a supportive person that would receive an e - mail message with tailored advice for supporting the subject . Program materials consisted of an initial web - based cessation guide , three sequential tailored newsletters delivered via the web and behavioral support messages delivered via e - mail over a 10 - week period . The content of the program was based on cognitive – behavioral methods of smoking cessation and relapse prevention , including stimulus control , self - efﬁcacy enhancement , suggestions for cop - ing and encouraging compliance with nicotine replace - ment therapy ( Shiffman , Read & AMP ; Jarvik 1985 ; Fiore © 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction , 100 , 682 – 688 684 Victor J . Strecher et al . et al . 1990 ) . Over 10 30 different substantive combina - tions ( i . e . combinations excluding numeric and name - based variables in the calculation ) of the materials could be created . This represents a substantial increase over previous tailored cessation programs in tailoring depth or ‘granularity’ of the cessation advice provided . The format and volume of materials was equivalent for all CQ PLAN enrollees , but content and presentation was tailored based on enrollment information . Web - based control condition Web - based materials of the control condition had a graphic design and navigational structure very similar to the CQ PLAN . Cognitive – behavioral concepts similar to those addressed in the CQ PLAN were presented . Instruc - tion on product use was also similar to instructions included in the CQ Plan . The primary differences were that subjects in the control condition did not receive : ( a ) tailored materials , i . e . enrollment data were not used to select the information or organize the information received by the user ; ( b ) the three follow - up newsletters ; and ( c ) the opportunity to identify a supportive person who subsequently received an e - mail message with tai - lored advice . Abstinence measures In the 6 - week questionnaire , continuous abstinence was deﬁned as self - report of no smoking at all for the previous 28 days . This is similar to generally accepted criteria used by numerous regulatory agencies around the world for assessing efﬁcacy ( US Food & Drug Administration 1995 ) . There was , however , no biochemical veriﬁcation of self - reported abstinence ; biochemical veriﬁcation is considered impractical in large - scale population - based studies ( Strecher et al . 1989 ; Patrick et al . 1994 ) . At 12 weeks , continuous abstinence was deﬁned as at least 10 weeks of abstinence . Data analysis Primary analyses focused on subjects who were random - ized to one of the two treatment conditions and logged - on to the intervention website at least once ( LO ) . Outcomes were also examined using an intent - to - treat ( ITT ) analy - sis ( all subjects who were randomized to treatment conditions regardless of whether they logged - on to the intervention website ) and an analysis including subjects who used the program and responded to the follow - up questionnaire ( UPR ) . In the LO and ITT analyses , subjects who withdrew from the study or did not answer the absti - nence questions were considered as treatment failures ( that they did smoke ) . Subjects were included in the UPR population if they : ( 1 ) did not withdraw from the study ; ( 2 ) answered the continuous abstinence question ; ( 3 ) reported having read at least some of the materials ; and ( 4 ) did not report having used other smoking cessation aids or programs . Differences between treatment outcomes were as - sessed using logistic regression . A secondary multivariate model included age and baseline smoking rate as covari - ates . We also assessed whether enhanced compliance with nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) medication could have mediated the treatment effects . In other words , did the behaviorally based CQ PLAN treatment program per se have a direct effect on cessation and / or did the CQ PLAN have an indirect effect by increasing medi - cation compliance , which in turn improved cessation outcomes ? Shiffman et al . ( 2000 ) found that the print - based CQ PLAN intervention enhanced nicotine gum compliance but also demonstrated that cessation out - comes were not completely mediated by improved gum compliance . Satisfaction , helpfulness and relevance with the two web - based treatments at the 6 - week follow - up were also ascertained . Subjects were asked whether they would rec - ommend the program to other smokers and , if they were smoking at the 6 - week follow - up , whether they would use the program again in the future . Follow - up procedures Six weeks after their stated quit date , subjects were sent an e - mail to access a questionnaire which asked about their smoking abstinence , compliance with their pro - gram and patches and perceptions regarding their program . After a 2 - week window , subjects were not per - mitted to respond but could still continue in the study . At 12 weeks after their stated quit date , subjects were sent a second questionnaire similar to the previous one , again with a 2 - week window . Multiple e - mail reminders and compensation were provided to encourage completion of the follow - up ques - tionnaires . Subjects completing either 6 - or 12 - week questionnaires received oral care products to the value of £5 ( roughly $ 9 ) ( e . g . toothpaste , brushes ) . Subjects com - pleting both 6 - and 12 - week questionnaires received oral care products to the value of £20 ( roughly $ 35 ) . Ques - tions about abstinence were administered through an ini - tial e - mail message instructing the subject to click one of two buttons—one button for ‘did not smoke’ or the other for ‘did smoke’ during the previous 28 days ( 6 - week follow - up ) or 10 weeks ( 12 - week follow - up ) . When the subject clicked a button that response was automatically registered , and the subject brought to the website to com - plete the remainder of the questionnaire . Subjects who clicked ‘did smoke’ were then asked if they smoked during Web - based computer - tailored smoking cessation program and NRT 685 © 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction , 100 , 682 – 688 the previous 7 days ( point prevalence ) . All respondents were asked questions regarding compliance and program satisfaction . Subject attrition Of the 3971 subjects enrolled in the study ( constituting the ITT denominator ) , 1991 were randomized to the CQ PLAN and 1980 to the control condition . Of those ran - domized , 232 in the CQ PLAN and 238 in the control condition never logged - on to the website to receive their behavioral treatment . In the ITT analyses , subjects who never logged - on to the website were included in the denominator and considered to be smokers . Of the 3501 who logged on to the website at least once , 31 subjects actively withdrew ( 15 in the CQ PLAN and 16 in the control condition ) before the 6 - week follow - up , leaving 3470 to receive the 6 - week follow - up web - based survey . A total of 1850 ( 53 . 3 % ) responded to the 6 - week follow - up survey . Among the respondents , 37 subjects reported not having read the materials ; and 552 reported using other smoking cessation aids or programs during the course of the study . These subjects were included in LO and ITT analyses but removed for the UPR analyses , which examined those who responded to follow - up , used the materials , and did not use other ces - sation treatments . Between 6 - and 12 - week follow - up periods , 15 more subjects had withdrawn actively from the study ( eight in the CQ PLAN and seven in the control condition ) , leaving 3455 subjects , of whom 1491 ( 43 . 2 % ) responded to the 12 - week survey . A total of 45 subjects reported not hav - ing read the materials and 471 reported using other smoking cessation aids or programs . As in the 6 - week analysis procedure , these subjects were included in LO and ITT analyses but removed for the UPR analyses . Response rates to the 6 - and 12 - week follow - ups did not differ between the two treatment conditions . Respon - dents did not differ from non - respondents by age or gen - der , but differed slightly in baseline smoking rate . On average , 6 - week non - respondents smoked 0 . 8 cigarettes more than respondents ( F = 8 . 1 ; P < 0 . 01 ) ; 12 - week non - respondents smoked 1 . 0 cigarettes more than respon - dents ( F = 13 . 7 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . RESULTS Outcome analyses Table 1 presents 6 - and 12 - week outcomes by treatment condition . The primary 6 - week LO analysis found a sig - niﬁcantly higher 28 - day continuous abstinence rate among subjects assigned to the CQ PLAN ( 29 . 0 % ) than the control condition ( 23 . 9 % ) . Among the ITT subjects who enrolled in the study but did not necessarily log - on to the website to receive treatment , a signiﬁcantly higher 6 - week 28 - day continuous abstinence rate was also found among CQ PLAN subjects ( 25 . 6 % ) than control subjects ( 21 . 0 % ) . Signiﬁcant differences between the CQ PLAN and control conditions remained at 12 - week fol - low - up using both LO ( 22 . 8 % versus 18 . 1 % ) and ITT ( 20 . 1 % versus 15 . 9 % ) analyses . UPR analyses also dem - onstrate consistently higher continuous abstinence rates in the CQ PLAN than the control condition at 6 weeks ( 54 . 4 % versus 46 . 8 % ) and 12 weeks ( 55 . 4 % versus 43 . 3 % ) . These outcomes did not change when baseline age and smoking rate were entered into the logistic model . Subjects in the CQ PLAN group reported using nico - tine patches for signiﬁcantly longer over the course of the study ( 9 . 2 versus 8 . 5 weeks ; P < 0 . 001 ) Given that patch use typically stops when smokers relapse , this could be simply because those in the CQ PLAN group were more likely to remain abstinent . However , it is noteworthy that the effect of the CQ PLAN remained largely unaffected even after duration of patch use had been controlled for ( OR = 1 . 42 CI : 1 . 15 – 1 . 74 ; c 2 = 10 . 7 , P = 0 . 001 ) showing Table 1 Comparison of abstinence rates between CQ PLAN and control conditions .

Strecher et al . that the CQ PLAN effect was not mediated by increased patch use . Program satisfaction On the 6 - week questionnaire , respondents in the CQ PLAN condition were more likely than those in the con - trol condition to report the materials as being helpful and relevant ( Table 2 ) , and more likely to state they would recommend the program to others . Among those who were smoking at the 6 - week follow - up , CQ PLAN respon - dents were more likely to state that they would use the program in the future . DISCUSSION This study demonstrated the efﬁcacy of the tailored web - based CQ PLAN behavioral smoking cessation program over a non - tailored web - based program in subjects using nicotine patches . Using three different analysis strategies , differing in whether subjects logged - on to the web site , used the program materials , did not use other cessation treatments or responded to follow - up , subjects random - ized to the CQ PLAN condition reported signiﬁcantly higher rates of cessation at both 6 - and 12 - week follow - up . Moreover , the effects on cessation from the tailored CQ PLAN were above and beyond any effects related to nicotine patch use . The effect sizes of this intervention are comparable to those found in print - based tailored materials studies . In a meta - analysis of print - based tailored versus non - tailored self - help smoking cessation materials ( Lancaster & Stead 2002 ) found an average odds ratio of 1 . 36 ( CI : 1 . 13 – 1 . 64 ) for computer - tailored materials compared with non - tailored or stage - matched materials ( 10 studies ) . As a point of comparison , Lichtenstein et al . ( 1996 ) found an average odds ratio of 1 . 34 ( CI : 1 . 19 – 1 . 51 ) for telephone counseling compared with control conditions ( 13 studies ) . The effects found in this study are also consistent with the results of two trials of print - based computer - tailored behavioral materials added to nicotine replacement ther - apy . In one study ( Shiffman et al . 2000 ) , provision of the tailored print Committed Quitters program with nicotine gum therapy signiﬁcantly increased quit rates compared to the use of nicotine gum with prepackaged instructions and cessation advice alone ( 6 weeks : 36 . 2 versus 24 . 7 % ; 12 weeks : 27 . 6 versus 17 . 7 % ) . In a similar study of the print Committed Quitters program with the nicotine patch ( Shiffman et al . 2001 ) , abstinence rates differed among those who reported using their assigned materials ( over 80 % of the sample – 6 weeks : 38 . 2 versus 30 . 7 % ; 12 weeks : 18 . 2 versus 11 . 1 % ) . While the efﬁcacy of these three approaches appears comparable , the costs differ substantially . The costs of commercial telecounseling products usually range between $ 150 and $ 250 per smoker ; tailored print prod - ucts usually vary between $ 5 and $ 40 per smoker and tailored web products , depending on size of the popula - tion , can be less than $ 1 per smoker . Thus the web may offer a relatively high - reach , high - efﬁcacy , low - cost approach to population - based smoking cessation . Web - based programs may also have the potential for reaching large numbers of smokers ( Bock et al . 2004 ) . The number of adult web users in the world now exceeds half a billion ( NUA Internet Survey 2003 ) . Over 60 % of individuals in the United Kingdom ( NUA Internet Survey 2003 ) and over 70 % of individuals in the United States ( UCLA Internet Report 2003 ) use the internet . The Pew Internet and American Life Project survey conducted in late 2002 ( Fox & Fallows 2003 ) found roughly 7 million individuals ( 6 % of US internet users ) searching the web for information on how to quit smoking . This reach appears to compare favorably with an estimated 500 000 – 700 000 ( 1 . 1 – 1 . 7 % ) of adult smokers calling a quitline over the course of a year ( Ossip - Klein & McIntosh 2003 ) . The effects of the CQ PLAN intervention in the study were incremental to the well - known effects of nicotine patch itself in enhancing abstinence ( Silagy et al . 2004 ) . One objective of the program was to enhance compliance with use of the nicotine patch , and smokers in the CQ PLAN were indeed found to use patches for longer . Whether this was because of compliance interventions in the CQ PLAN or just because they were abstinent longer is not known . In any case , the analysis showed that the CQ PLAN’s effects on abstinence were not mediated by Table 2 Satisfaction with the two treatments at 6 - week follow - up ( % afﬁrmative ) .

Web - based computer - tailored smoking cessation program and NRT 687 © 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction , 100 , 682 – 688 increased patch use , but derived from the advice and sup - port conveyed by the material . The current study should not be considered a direct test isolating the effects of tailoring on the efﬁcacy of smoking cessation materials . The CQ PLAN had more waves of interaction with the user than the non - tailored control condition and it is possible that the additional interactions may have created the effect on smoking ces - sation . However , a direct test of the effect of increasing mailings of tailored materials failed to demonstrate effects on cessation ( Velicer et al . 1999 ) . The CQ PLAN—but not the control condition—also allowed the subject to identify a supportive person who would subsequently receive an e - mail message with tailored advice for supporting the sub - ject . While this addition may have accounted for improve - ments in cessation , a review of research studying the impact of buddy systems ( May & West 2000 ) found only two of 10 such studies to demonstrate a signiﬁcant effect on cessation . None the less , a control condition that allows an adequate test of tailoring per se would require far greater structural similarities to the tailored condition . This study could not verify claims of abstinence bio - chemically because of the geographical spread of the sample . However , false reporting is considered to be min - imal where there is no personal contact with a therapist ( Strecher et al . 1989 ; Velicer et al . 1992 ) . The high rate of loss to follow - up is also a limitation . However , the loss to follow - up was similar to that typically found in large - scale smoking cessation trials . In our ITT analysis all sub - jects lost to follow - up were considered to be smokers , pos - sibly making the ITT success rates unduly low . There are many possible reasons for loss to follow - up ( e . g . lost access to e - mail or internet ; blockage of e - mail reminders due to so - called ‘spam detectors’ ) . Regardless , the observed difference between the treatment conditions could not be explained by dropout , as there was no differ - ence in dropout rates and a signiﬁcant treatment effect was observed . Another limitation of the study is the relatively short follow - up period . Relapse curves from smoking cessation trials indicate that it is possible to extrapolate from 10 weeks of continuous abstinence to long - term success with relapse rates being the same in intervention and control conditions ( Hughes et al . 2003 ) . Thus , the odds ratio indicating the relative efﬁcacy of the CQ PLAN and control interventions should be generalizable , although the absolute abstinence rates would be expected to dimin - ish over time . Future web - based studies should examine longer - term abstinence rates . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst large - scale trial of an automated web - based smoking cessation intervention . Results of this study demonstrate a promising short - term outcome of tailored web - based programming in conjunc - tion with nicotine replacement therapy .
