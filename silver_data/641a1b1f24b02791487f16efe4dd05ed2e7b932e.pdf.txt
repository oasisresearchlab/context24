Gorelkin a Abstract Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) is the most common form of dementia , a progressive neurological disorder characterized by short and long - term memory loss , including cognitive and functional impairment , which is refractory to current therapy . It is suggested that the aggregation of β - amyloid ( A β ) peptide on neuronal cell surface leads to various deviations of its vital function due to myriad pathways defined by internalization of calcium ions , apoptosis promotion , reduction of membrane potential , synaptic activity loss etc . These are associated with structural reorganizations and pathologies of the cell cytoskeleton mainly involving actin filaments and microtubules , and consequently – alterations of cell mechanical properties . Thus , the effect of amyloid oligomers on cells ’ Young’s modulus has been observed in a variety of studies . However , the precise connection between the formation of amyloid aggregates on cell membranes and their effects on local mechanical properties of living cells is still unresolved . In this work , we have used correlative scanning ion - conductance microscopy ( SICM ) to study cell topography , Young’s modulus mapping and confocal imaging of A β aggregates formation on living cell surfaces with subsequent assessment of the reactive oxygen species levels inside single cells using platinum nanoelectrodes . We showed that correlative SICM technique , in conjunction with topography mapping and confocal imaging , can be used for Patch - Clamp recordings from living cells with evidently formed FAM - labeled A β aggregates on its surface . As we demonstrated , SICM can be successfully applied to studying cytotoxicity mechanisms of A β aggregates on living cell surface . Introduction Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) , are characterized by the formation of toxic protein aggregates that cause dysfunction and death of neuronal cells 1 – 4 . Extensive neurodegeneration in AD is preceded by early synaptic disorders associated with changes in the membrane ion conductivity of neuronal cells 5 – 7 . It has been shown that receptor - mediated toxicity and disruption of ion channel function can induce subsequent stages of the pathogenic cascade , such as pathology of tau proteins and neuroinflammation in AD 8 – 10 . Also , it is known that the development of neurodegenerative diseases is closely associated with dysfunction of the cytoskeleton . Oligomers of β - amyloid peptide ( A β ) cause hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the tau protein , which leads to destabilization of microtubules . β - amyloid also mediates alterations of the actin cytoskeleton - on the one hand , due to the activation of the kinases LIMK1 , p38MAPK , CAMKII , Rho / Cdc42 GTPases , and on the other hand , due to the induction of oxidative stress , leading to glutathionylation and polymerization of actin filaments 11 – 16 . The state of the cytoskeleton is associated with a biophysical property , Young’s modulus of the cell , which is the most important mechanism for regulating the functions of membrane proteins . Treatment with A β oligomers leads to a pathological change in membrane properties , but the data with regard to the direction of this change and the mechanisms involved are contradictory . Most of the results have been obtained using Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) , which exerts an adverse effect on the scanned cells due to high force applied . AFM is widely used to study the morphology and self - assembly of amyloid aggregates 17 – 20 , as well as for monitoring interactions between amyloid aggregates and other biological systems . However , deformation of soft cell features and other biological samples with a cantilever is a significant disadvantage of this method 21 , 22 . Scanning ion - conductance microscopy ( SICM ) measures local mechanical properties of cells in cell culture 23 , 24 , making it possible to study the contributions of various molecular mechanisms to changes in membrane properties mediated by β - amyloid and potentially identify molecular targets to prevent or ameliorate this effect . Fusco et al . recently reported 25 their observation of loss of membrane integrity in human neuroblastoma cells during incubation with toxic oligomers of α - Syn using confocal scanning microscopy . Although fluorescence - based imaging techniques are sensitive and efficient in determining cell permeability , it is still difficult to use these to obtain direct evidence for membrane disruption or morphological change in cell membranes . For a more complete understanding of the properties of such protein aggregates on cell membranes , a high - resolution surface imaging technique is a .

SICM is capable of imaging cell surfaces , proteins in the membranes of living cells with nanoscale resolution and specific ion channels 26 – 29 . Thus , with this method it is possible to visualize the possible pore formation caused by α - Syn , with a resolution diameter of several nanometers 30 . Moreover , SICM can be used for local delivery / excitation and detection of various analytes 31 , 32 as well as to study individual aggregates of beta - amyloid , causing a temporary influx of calcium through the cell membrane of neuronal cells32 . Recently , SICM has been used to examine the effect of α - Syn aggregates on SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cell membranes , a novel approach to study neurological disorders 30 . Studies were performed with cells pre - cultured with α - Syn aggregates ; when using SICM , dramatic violations of cell membranes were observed . The potential role of extracellular α - Syn in pathogenesis is supported by the observation of α - Syn oligomers in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Parkinson ' s disease 34 . In addition , a recent electrophysiological study of hippocampal neurons has shown that extracellular α - Syn has a significant effect on membraneintegrity . However , SICM visualization of beta - amyloid aggregates on live cells as well as Young’s modulus alteration and correlative confocal imaging have not yet been reported . Thus , the nanopipette , as a key element of SICM , can be used as a nanoscale sensor . Sensors based on nanopipettes are used to determine the kinetics of formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , the oxygen gradient and the profile of local pH values in neuronal cells and tissues 35 – 37 . Hence , this technique may be successfully used for studying connection of ROS generation and local mechanical properties of cells treated with β - amyloid . In this study we have demonstrated the unique advantages of SICM for studying A β aggregate formation on living SH - SY5Y cell membranes , which play a key role in the development of Alzhe imer’s disease . We first observed the disruption of lipid membranes in response to localized amyloid aggregate . We then measured the reduction of membrane potential by performing current clamp recordings using whole cell mode . We then successfully made intracellular ROS level measurements using nanoelectrodes and showed increased ROS level in cells induced by formed aggregates on the cell surface . Figure 1 .

Name . , 2013 , 00 , 1 - 3 | 3 Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins Results and Discussion In this work , using SICM we have revealed formation of abnormal structures on living cell surfaces after 4 hours of incubation with 10 μM Aβ 42 , ( Fig . 1 a - d ) , which is similar to α - Syn aggregates described previously 30 . The pS8 - Aβ 42 and isoD7 - Aβ 42 peptides are post - translationally modified forms of β - amyloid , which are found in vivo and could be significant for pathogenesis of AD 38 – 40 . Moreover , the formation of such structures has been accompanied by dramatic increase of Young’s modulus of the whole cell ( S1 ) . In contrast local Young’s modulus at the area of the formed structure is reduced ( Fig . 1 i - l ) . It is known that incubation with β - amyloid oligomers leads to a significant increase in the amount of fibrillar actin , which may contribute to the cell ’s Young ' s modulus as measured by SICM . The disturbance of calcium homeostasis caused by Aβ 42 leads to the activation of Rho GTPases , which are key regulators of F - actin polymerization 41 . Thus , using the SICM technique , we can confirm the changes in Young’s modulus distribution in living cells induced by Aβ 42 and its isoforms .

Name . , 2012 , 00 , 1 - 3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins as an integral characteristic of the state of the cytoskeleton in cells , we can determine which mechanisms lead to changes in the dynamics of the cytoskeleton under the action of Aβ 42 . Aβ 42 has been reported to induce cytoskeletal modifications such as microtubule disassembly and actin polymerization leading to synaptic degeneration in neurons 13 . These effects lead to changes in the mechanical properties of cells , which can be assessed using the SICM technique . In addition , we used fluorescently labeled Aβ 42 ( FAM - Aβ 42 ) to study the structure , shape and size of Aβ aggregates on the surface of the cell membrane ( Figure 2 a - c ) . The possibility of studying the structure of such protein aggregates was demonstrated by an example of α - synuclein when exposed to compounds based on cinnamic acid derivatives that prevent the aggregation process . It is clearly observable that β - amyloid aggregates form pore - like structures embedded in the cell membrane ( Figure 2 d - е ) . The formed structures on Figure 2 ( d - g ) have 5 , 4 µm 2 in area and 4 , 5 µm in length . In previous works , including those performed on SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , the alterations in cell stiffness were induced by treatment with oligomeric preparations of Aβ obtained with in vitro aggregation 12 , 13 . Here , the changes in Young’s modulus were observed in cells treated with fresh preparations of Aβ 42 , previously shown to contain > 80 % monomers 42 . Since the formation of oligomers under the specified experimental conditions is unlikely , the monomeric forms of Aβ seem to be also capable of influencing the mechanical properties of SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cells . Also , it is evident that the interaction with the cell membrane markedly accelerates the aggregation of Aβ 42 leading to formation of large structures on the cell surface . We then used correlative SICM to obtain the topography ( Figure 2h ) , Young’s modulus distribution ( Figure 2k ) and confocal imaging living SH - SY5Y cells simultaneously treated with FAM - Aβ 42 ( Figure 2i ) and DiD lipid dye ( Figure 2m ) . As we can see , abnormal structures on the cell topography and the local decrease in Young’s modulus at the same spot are highly co - localized with fluorescent signal of FAM - Aβ 42 and the DiD lipid dye . We presume that high intensity DiD dye fluorescence corresponds to increased concentration of lipids on focal plane and local disruption of cell membrane . Detergent - like properties of amyloid aggregates were reported previously 43 , but commonly have been shown using artificial cell membrane models such as liposomes or lipid bilayers , and not on living cells 44 – 46 . Correlative SICM allows us to perform Patch - Clamp recordings on cells where membrane - bound β - amyloid aggregates were detected with topography mapping and confocal imaging ( Figure 2 ) . In such cells , we observed lower membrane potential ( - 30 mV ) compared to control cells ( - 50 mV ) . Reduced membrane potential ( S2 ) is possibly connected to metabolic alteration like ROS generation and mitochondrial disfunction 47 , 48 leading to ionic homeostasis impairment . Further , we used Pt nanoelectrodes for intracellular ROS measurements . In cells with membrane - bound FAM - Aβ 42 aggregates we noticed a significant increase ( Figure 3 ) in ROS related to the ability of Aβ 42 to disrupt the mitochondria and induce oxidative stress , as well as to Aβ - induced calcium influx 48 . Notably , ROS levels measurements in cells treated with FAM - Aβ 42 without aggregates on the membrane , demonstrated induced oxidative stress but to a lower extent than cells with membrane - bound aggregates . Higher cytotoxicity of amyloid aggregates than free oligomers is clear , a matter which was unresolved in previous studies . Conclusions In this work , correlative SICM was successfully used as a multimodal technique for studying β - amyloid aggregate formation on the surface of living SH - SY5Y cells . We have shown that there is an increase of Young’s modulus of the whole cell during treatment with β - amyloid and its modified forms and the formation of abnormal structures characterized by locally reduced Young’s modulus . Simultaneous confocal imaging allowed us to detect pore - like formation of β - amyloid aggregates followed by local membrane disruption leading to a reduction in membrane potential . Pt nanoelectrode application demonstrated higher toxicity and oxidative stress induction by membrane - bound aggregates in comparison to soluble oligomers of β - amyloid . Methods and Methods Amyloid peptides preparation Synthetic peptides ( purity > 98 % checked by RP - HPLC ) Aβ 42 ( DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA ) , fluoresceine amidite - Аβ 42 ( FAM - Аβ 42 ) , pS8 - A β 42 and isoD7 - A β 42 were purchased from Biopeptide Co . , LLC ( San Diego , CA , USA ) . Peptides were monomerized as described previously 49 . A fresh 2 . 5 mM solution of Aβ was prepared by adding 20 µl of 100 % cell culture grade anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( “Sigma” ) to 0 . 224 mg of peptide , followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature to completely dissolve the peptide . Cell preparation SH - SY5Y neuroblastoma cells ( ATCC , USA ) were cultivated according to a standard protocol in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM / F - 12 , Gibco , USA ) with 1 % L - glutamine and 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazine - ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) ( 15 mM , Fisher ) supplemented with fetal bovine serum ( 10 % ( v / v ) , Gibco , USA ) and penicillin – streptomycin ( 1 % ) ( Research Product International , Mt Prospect , IL ) . TrypLE ( 0 . 25 % , Fisher ) was used to detach cells from the culture plate and fresh culturing medium was added every 3 – 4 d . SH - SY5Y ( 3 × 10 5 ) cells were seeded in 35 mm Petri dishes and treated the next day with either Aβ 42 , FAM - Аβ 42 , pS8 - A β 42 or isoD7 - A β 42 . The amyloid peptides were dissolved in DMSO as described above and diluted in serum - free culture medium . The final concentration of the peptides in the culture medium was 10 µM with 4 h of incubation time . Cells treated with an equivalent amount of DMSO in culture medium without amyloid peptides were used as a control , which was performed at the beginning and at the end of the experiment . Before imaging , cells were washed three times with Hanks’ Balanced Journal Name COMMUNICATION This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx J .

For confocal imaging of cell membranes , Vibrant DiD - lipid dye ( Thermofisher , USA ) was used at a final concentration of 1 µM . Scanning Ion - Conductance Microscopy ( SICM ) Scanning procedure was performed using SICM manufactured by ICAPPIC ( ICAPPIC Ltd , United Kingdom ) . Nanopipettes with a typical radius 40 - 50 nm were drawn from borosilicate capillaries ( 1 . 0 mm , OD ; 0 . 5 mm , ID ; Sutter Instruments , USA ) using a Laser Puller P - 2000 ( Sutter Instruments , USA ) . Cell topography and QNM were performed using the non - contact hopping mode with an adaptive resolution with maps of 40 × 40 μm , with image resolution of 256 × 256 pixels . The approach rate during imaging was set at 100 μm s−1 . For all SICM measurements , a three - set point mode was used . A non - contact topographic image was obtained at an ion current decrease of 0 . 5 % and a further two images were obtained at an ion current decrease of 1 % and 2 % corresponding to membrane deformations produced by intrinsic force at each setpoint . Correlative scanning ion - conductance microscopy and confocal microscopy were performed using SICM manufactured by ICAPPIC ( ICAPPIC Limited , United Kingdom ) equipped with a confocal module ( ICAPPIC Limited , United Kingdom ) . l . For further correlative imaging , a 25 . 3 mW laser beam with a wavelength of 635 nm was focused on the nanopipette tip so that the focal plane of the laser beam and nanopipette tip were in the same place . In this work , Patch - Clamp recordings were performed using SICM by ICAPPIC . Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass 1 . 0 mm OD and 0 . 5 ID ( Sutter Instruments , USA ) with typical electrical resistance of 10 - 20 MOhms using the following two - step program - HEAT1 310 , FIL1 3 , VEL1 30 , DEL1 150 , PUL1 0 , HEAT2 300 , FIL2 4 , VEL2 25 , DEL2 150 , PUL2 200 . Patch - Clamp recordings Submicron pipettes with a typical radius 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 μ m were used for scanning cell topography with correlative confocal imaging by SICM ICAPPIC to find SH - SY5Y cells with formed aggregates of FAM - Аβ 42 on the cell membrane ( Fig . 2 n , o ) . A giga - ohm seal was then made by applying light negative pressure near the cell membrane . Whole - cell mode through applying sharp negative pressure has been performed . After that membrane potential was measured at current zero mode . Intracellular ROS level measurements The total ROS concentration was determined by the amperometric method using Pt - nanoelectrodes . Commercially available disk - shaped carbon nanoelectrodes isolated in quartz ( ICAPPIC Limited , UK ) with diameters 60 – 1 00 nm were used to prepare Pt nanoelectrodes . Firstly , the carbon surface was etched in a 0 . 1 M NaOH , 10 mM KCl solution during 40 cycles of 10 seconds ( from 0 to + 2200 mV ) to create nanocavities . Further electrochemical deposition of platinum in nanocavities was achieved by cycling from 0 to 800 mV with a scan rate of 200 mV / s for 4 to 5 cycles in 2 mM H2PtCl6 solution in 0 . 1 M hydrochloric acid . Cyclic voltammetry from - 800 to 800 mV with a scan rate of 400 mV / s in a 1 mM solution of ferrocene in methanol in PBS was used to control the electrode surface at all stages of fabrication . Prior to the measurements , each platinum nanoelectrode was calibrated using a series of standard H2O2 solutions at a potential of + 800 mV . Preparation of Pt - nanoelectrodes has been described in detail elsewhere . A nanoelectrode penetrated the cells and measured the oxidation current of hydrogen peroxide . On average , about 8 cells were measured by 2 – 4 Pt electrodes in independent Petri dishes . To confirm that fibril - like formations on SH - SY5Y cell surface are indeed amyloid aggregates , FAM - Аβ 42 was used in similar conditions as Aβ42 which are described earlier .
