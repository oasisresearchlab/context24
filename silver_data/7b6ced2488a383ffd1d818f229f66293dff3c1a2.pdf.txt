Expression changes in fatty acid metabolic process - related genes in porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation Abstract Mammalian oocytes undergo compound processes of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation that allow them to reach MII stage . Only fully mature , oocyte can be successfully fertilized by a single spermatozo - on . Fatty acids , apart from their role in cellular metabolism , inflammation and tissue development , have positive and detrimental effects on oocyte maturation , fertilization , blastocyst cleavage rate and embryo development in mammals . Using microarrays , we have analyzed the expression changes in fatty acids - - related genes during in vitro maturation of porcine oocytes . The oocytes were recovered from ovaries of 45 pubertal crossbred Landrace gilts and subsequently subjected to BCB test . For further analyses , only granulosa cell - free BCB + oocytes were used and divided into two groups . The first one , described as “before IVM” , was directly exposed to molecular assays , the second one , described as “after IVM” , was first in vitro matured and then subjected to a second BCB test . Oocytes , if classified as BCB + , were then passed to corresponding molecular analyses . We found significant down - regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolic process , such as : ACSL6 , EPHX2 , FADS2 , PTGES , TPI1 , TBXAS1 , NDUFAB1 , MIF , ACADSB and DECR1 in porcine oocytes analyzed after IVM , in comparison to those analyzed before IVM . In conclusion , apart from poor data available concerning analyzed genes in relation to reproductive events , significant changes in their expression point to their potential role as an oocyte developmental competence markers in pigs . Introducing molecular diagnostics of oocytes could be the prospective tool for selection of best gametes , leading to improved outcomes of in vitro fertilization .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 49 Introduction Ovarian follicles of mammals are composed of cumulus - oocyte complexes ( COCs ) and surround - ing somatic granulosa and theca cells . The process of follicle growth , called folliculogenesis , includes numerous stages of primary , secondary , antral and fully matured Graafian follicle [ 1 ] . Both , in vivo and in vitro , folliculogenesis is accompanied by the pro - cess of oogenesis - the maturation of the oocyte . The latter is very complex and involves stages of germinal vesicle ( GV ) , germinal vesicle breakdown ( GVBD ) , metaphase I ( MI ) , ending with the mature oocyte at metaphase II ( MII ) [ 2 ] . During these stag - es an oocyte grows and undergoes several mor - phological and biochemical modifications . The first ones include cumulus cells’ ( CCs ) expansion and structural and ultrastructural changes in the oocyte’s organelles [ 3 ] . The second group includes nuclear maturation , leading to achievement of an appropriate chromosome configuration by the oo - cyte , and cytoplasmic , which is accompanied by the accumulation of mRNA and proteins necessary for successful fertilization and further early embryo growth [ 4 ] . Thus , all mentioned steps are crucial for the oocyte to acquire developmental competency , manifested by the fertilisation ability and proper embryo growth [ 5 ] . Therefore , intracellular mod - ifications , taking place during maturation process , may be the marker of oocyte’s quality , as well as the developmental potential of in vitro matured gam - etes . Consequently , molecular alterations underly - ing this process are crucial to be defined . Thus , we analysed changes in genes expression profile in immature and mature porcine oocytes us - ing Affymetrix microarray assays [ 6 , 7 ] . We select - ed genes belonging to fatty acid metabolic process ontology group . Our selection was caused by the fact that apart from their role in cellular metabo - lism , inflammation and tissue development [ 8 ] fatty acids have been involved in cell - cell interactions , membrane transport and signaling events , which are crucial in reproductive events [ 9 ] . It was shown , that fatty acids can have detrimental effects on oo - cyte maturation , fertilization , blastocyst cleavage rate and embryo development in mammals [ 10 ] . All this together points to a possibility that , also in pig oocytes , fatty acid administration can influ - ence the outcome of maturation . We focused on spontaneous changes of fatty acids during porcine oocyte in vitro maturation , suggesting potential gene markers of their developmental compatibility . Material and methods Experimental design Oocytes were collected and , after double Brilliant Cresyl Blue ( BCB ) test , divided into two groups . The first group ( “before IVM” ) included oocytes graded as BCB - positive ( BCB + ) and directly exposed to mi - croarray assay and RT - qPCR . The second group ( “af - ter IVM” ) included BCB + oocytes which were then matured in vitro and , if classified as BCB + in second BCB test , passed to molecular analyses . Animals A total of 45 pubertal crossbred Landrace gilts bred on a commercial local farm were used in this study . They had a mean age of 155 days ( range 140 – 170 days ) and weight of 100 kg ( 95 - 120 kg ) . All animals were bred under the same conditions and fed the same forage ( depending on age and repro - ductive status ) . All experiments were approved by the Local Ethic Committee . Collection of porcine ovaries and cumulus - oocyte - complexes ( COCs ) The ovaries and reproductive tracts were recov - ered at slaughter and transported to the laboratory within 40 min at 38 o C in 0 . 9 % NaCl . To provide op - timal conditions for subsequent oocyte maturation and in vitro , the ovaries of each animal were placed in a 5 % fetal bovine serum solution ( FBS ; Sigma - Al - drich Co . , St . Louis , MO , USA ) in PBS . Single large follicles ( > 5mm ) were opened by puncturing with a 5ml syringe and 20 - G needle in a sterile Petri dish , COCs were recovered . The COCs were washed three times in modified PBS supplemented with 36 µg / ml pyruvate , 50 µg / ml gentamicin , and 0 . 5 mg / ml BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The COCs were selected under an inverted microscope - Zeiss , Axiovert 35 ( Lübeck , Germany ) , counted , and mor - phologically evaluated . Only COCs of grade I , pos - sessing homogeneous cytoplasm and uniform , com - pact cumulus cells , were considered for further use , resulting in a total of 300 grade I oocytes ( 3 x n = 50 “before IVM” group , 3 x n = 50 “after IVM” group ) . Assessment of oocyte developmental competence by BCB test Brilliant Cresyl Blue ( BCB ) test was used for as - sessment of porcine oocytes’ quality and maturity [ 11 ] . The glucose - 6 - phosphate ( G6PDH ) enzyme converts BCB stain from blue to colorless . In oocytes that completed the growth , activity of the enzyme decreases , the stain cannot be reduced , resulting in blue oocytes ( BCB + ) . To perform the BCB staining test , oocytes were washed twice in modified Dul - becco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline ( DPBS ) , commer - cially supplemented with 0 . 9 mM calcium , 0 . 49 mM magnesium , 0 . 33 mM pyruvate , and 5 . 5 mM glucose ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , and additional - ly with 50 IU / ml penicillin , 50 µg / ml streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , and 0 . 4 % Bo - vine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) [ w / v ] ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . They were then treated with 13 µM BCB ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) diluted in DPBS at 38 . 5°C , 5 % CO 2 for 90 min . After treatment , the oocytes were transferred to DPBS and washed twice . During washing , the oocytes were examined under Budna et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 50 an inverted microscope and classified as stained blue ( BCB + ) , or colorless ( BCB – ) . Only the granulo - sa cell - free BCB + oocytes were used for subsequent molecular analyses ( “before IVM” group ) , or IVM , followed by second BCB test and molecular analyses ( “after IVM” group ) . In vitro maturation of porcine cumulus - oocyte - complexes ( COCs ) After the first BCB test , the BCB + COCs were sub - jected to IVM . The COCs were cultured in Nunclon™Δ 4 - well dishes ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) in 500 μl standard porcine IVM culture me - dium : TCM - 199 ( tissue culture medium ) with Earle’s salts and L - glutamine ( Gibco BRL Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , supplemented with 2 . 2 mg / ml sodium bicarbonate ( Nacalai Tesque , Inc . , Kyoto , Japan ) , 0 . 1 mg / ml sodium pyruvate ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 10 mg / ml BSA ( Bovine Serum Al - bumin ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 0 . 1 mg / ml cysteine ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , 10 % ( v / v ) filtered porcine follicular fluid , and gonadotro - pin supplements at final concentrations of 2 . 5 IU / ml hCG ( human Chorionic Gonadotropin ) ( Ayerst Laboratories , Inc . , Philadelphia , PA , USA ) and 2 . 5 IU / ml eCG ( equine Chorionic Gonadotropin ) ( Intervet , Whitby , ON , Canada ) . Wells were covered with min - eral oil overlay and cultured at 38 o C under 5 % CO 2 in air for 22h , and then for additional 22h in medium without hormones . After cultivation , the second BCB staining test was performed , and BCB + oocytes were used for further molecular analyses . RNA extraction from porcine oocytes Total RNA was extracted from samples using TRI Reagent ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) and RNeasy MinElute cleanup Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . The amount of total mRNA was determined using optical density at 260 nm , and the RNA purity was estimated using the 260 / 280 nm absorption ratio ( higher than 1 . 8 ) ( NanoDrop spectrophotometer , Thermo Scientific , ALAB , Poland ) . The RNA integri - ty and quality were checked on a Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The resulting RNA integrity numbers ( RINs ) were between 8 . 5 and 10 with an average of 9 . 2 . The RNA in each sample was diluted to a concentration of 100 ng / μ l with an OD260 / OD280 ratio of 1 . 8 / 2 . 0 . From each RNA sample , 500 ng of RNA were taken . The remaining amount of isolated RNA was used for RT - qPCR study . Microarray expression analysis and statistics Experiments were performed in three replicates . Total RNA ( 100 ng ) from each pooled sample was subjected to two round sense cDNA amplification ( Ambion® WT Expression Kit ) . The obtained cDNA was used for biotin labeling and fragmentation by Affymetrix GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling and Hybridization ( Affymetrix ) . Biotin - labeled fragments of cDNA ( 5 . 5 μg ) were hybridized to Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array Strip ( 48°C / 20 h ) . Then , microarrays were washed and stained according to the technical protocol , using Affymetrix GeneAt - las Fluidics Station . The array strips were scanned , employing Imaging Station of GeneAtlas System . The preliminary analysis of the scanned chips was performed , using Affymetrix GeneAtlasTM Operat - ing Software . Quality of gene expression data was checked according to quality control criteria provid - ed by the software . Obtained CEL files were imported into downstream data analysis software . All analyses were performed using BioConductor software , based on the statistical R programming language . For background correction , normaliza - tion and summation of raw data , the Robust Mul - tiarray Averaging ( RMA ) algorithm , implemented in “affy” package of BioConductor , was applied . Bi - ological annotation was taken from BioConductor “oligo” package , where annotated data frame object was merged with normalized data set , resulting in a complete gene data table . Statistical significance of analyzed genes was performed by moderated t - sta - tistics from the empirical Bayes method . Obtained p value was corrected , for multiple comparisons , using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s false discov - ery rate . The selection of significantly changed gene expression was based on p value beneath 0 . 05 and expression fold higher than | 2 | . Functional annotation clustering of differentially expressed genes was performed using DAVID ( Da - tabase for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ) . Gene symbols for up - or down - regulat - ed genes , from each of the compared groups , were loaded to DAVID by “RDAVIDWebService” BioCon - ductor package . In this analysis we focused on one GO term group described as “fatty acid metabolic process” , that was separated from other GO groups and subjected to hierarchical clusterization algo - rithm and presented as a heat map graph . “fatty acid metabolic process” GO term ( GO : 0022610 ) belongs to Biological Process GO domain . Interactions between differentially expressed genes / proteins belonging to “fatty acid metabol - ic process” ontology group were investigated by STRING10 software ( Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes ) . List of gene names were used as query for interaction prediction . Searching criteria were based on co - occurrences of genes / proteins in scientific texts ( text mining ) , co - expression and ex - perimentally observed interactions . The results of such analysis generated gene / protein interaction network where the intensity of the edges reflects the strength of interaction score . Besides interac - tion prediction , STRING also allowed us to perform functional enrichments of GO terms based on previ - ously uploaded gene set from “fatty acid metabolic process” GO BP term . Budna et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 51 Finally , we checked if the genes that belongs to “fatty acid metabolic process” ontology group are also part of any pathway defined by pathway da - tabase . In that purpose we used Consensus Path Data Base , which integrates interaction networks in Homo sapiens including binary and complex protein - protein , genetic , metabolic , signaling , gene regulatory and drug - target interactions , as well as biochemical pathways . In our analysis we looked for pathway that contains at least 5 of studied genes . We search through pathways from Wikipathways , Netpath , Pharmgkb , Kegg , Humaneye , Ehmn , Inoh , Smpdb , Biocarta , Reactome , Signalink and Pid da - tabases . The enriched pathways were visualized in Cytoscape 3 . 5 . 0 software .

Bioethical Committee approval no . 32 / 2012 . Results Whole transcriptome profiling by Affymetrix mi - croarray allowed us to analyze the gene expression changes in freshly isolated oocytes , before in vitro procedure ( “before IVM” ) , in relation to after in vi - tro maturation ( “after IVM” ) . By Affymetrix® Por - cine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array , we have examined expres - sion of 12258 porcine transcripts . Genes with fold change higher than | 2 | and with corrected p value lower than 0 . 05 were considered as differentially ex - pressed . This set of genes consisted of 419 different transcripts . Subsequently , the genes were used for identification of significantly enriched GO BP terms . DAVID ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ) software was used for ex - traction of the genes belonging to “fatty acid meta - bolic process” gene ontology Biological Process term ( GO BP ) . We found that 10 genes from “fatty acid metabolic process” GO BP term were significantly represented in down - regulated gene set . This set of genes was subjected to hierarchical clusterization procedure and presented as heat map ( Fig . 1 ) . Set of the differentially expressed genes belong - ing to “fatty acid metabolic process” GO BP term with their official gene symbols , fold changes in expression , corrected p values and Entrez gene IDs were shown ( Tab . 1 ) . STRING - generated interaction network was cre - ated with differentially expressed genes belonging to the “fatty acid metabolic process” ontology group . The intensity of the edges reflects the strength of in - teraction score ( Fig . 2 ) .

The genes of mentioned pathway were involved in “Fatty acid , triacylglycerol , and ketone body metabolism” , “Arachidonic acid metab - olism” and “alpha - linolenic ( omega 3 ) and linoleic ( omega 6 ) acid metabolism” . The diagram of upreg - ulated pathway was shown in Figure 3 . Discussion Oocyte quality is a factor which has a great in - fluence not only on their maturation capability but also on successful fertilization , blastocyst forma - tion or even early embryo development [ 5 ] . Thus , we focused on porcine oocyte in vitro maturation process which , even if well known , still needs some improvements to increase blastocyst yield . Since it is well known that oocyte undergoes biochemical alterations during in vitro maturation , including transcriptomic profile changes , its mRNA is a great source of information on potential markers of de - velopmental capability . These alterations in gene expression can mirror synthesis of proteins neces - sary for acquiring full maturity , fertilization ability and proper growth of the early embryo [ 12 ] and thus , selection of high quality oocytes can increase prospective IVF outcome . Nowadays , there is a growing interest in fatty acids influence on reproductive processes . It was already elucidated that elevated levels on non - es - terified fatty acids ( NEFA ) are mirrored in ovarian follicles of cattle and human , having unfavorable ef - fect on oocytes maturation and fertilization capaci - ty [ 13 , 14 ] . Furthermore , blastocysts obtained from oocytes matured with addition of NEFA presented decreased cell counts and lowered quality [ 15 ] . Also , somatic cells coexisting in the ovarian follicle , like granulosa and theca cells , were susceptible to NEFA administration , resulting in impaired prolifer - ation rate and process of steroidogenesis [ 16 ] . On the contrary , Lee et al . found that treatment with alpha - linoleic acid during oocytes’ maturation im - proved their developmental competence by acceler - ating nuclear maturation and influencing cytoplas - mic maturation [ 17 ] . To analyze spontaneous changes of fatty acids administration in porcine oocytes during IVM , we selected several genes belonging to fatty acids asso - ciated ontology groups , like : ACSL6 , EPHX2 , FADS2 , PTGES , TPI1 , TBXAS1 , NDUFAB1 , MIF , ACADSB and DECR1 . All of them presented significant down - reg - ulated expression after standard IVM procedure . Among them three brought our attention . Prostaglandin E Synthase ( PTGES ) catalyzes the oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperox - ide H2 ( PGH2 ) to prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) . PTGES was found both on mRNA and protein level during ovarian development in human . Expression was predominantly found in germ cells with expression increasing along with gestation , suggesting PTGES role in germ cells development . This observation confirms PGE2’s role in ovarian development , being most likely is responsible for subsequent activation of genes important for oocyte persistence and matu - ration . Additionally , it can be involved in connections between germ and somatic cells during ovarian fol - licle formation [ 18 ] . Furthermore , the same inter - actions were observed in the postnatal life in cattle , where prostaglandins are regarded as responsible for cumulus - oocyte complex creation and play crit - ical role during pre - ovulatory COCs expansion and oocyte maturation [ 19 ] . The pre - ovulatory surge of gonadotropins increases PTGES level in cumulus cells , and thus leads to PGE2 up - regulation [ 20 , 21 ] . The latter is crucial for release of the oocyte but probably not for follicle rupture , and its luteinization [ 22 ] . Changes in PGE2 and progesterone level are hallmarks of final COCs differentiation and influence developmental competence of the oocyte [ 23 ] . Another gene the Macrophage Migration Inhibi - tory Factor ( MIF ) , encodes a protein predominate - ly associated with macrophages . It regulates their function by suppressing anti - inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids at infection sites . However , there are many other properties of MIF already revealed . Among them MIF mRNA expression was found in murine ovulated oocytes , zygotes , 2 - cell embryos , 8 - cell embryos , blastocyst and reproductive organs , like uterus and oviduct . The presence of transcripts of that gene was recorded in all of them , however its highest expression occurred in uterus during preg - nancy and embryos , suggesting yet unknown func - tion of MIF in establishing early pregnancy [ 24 ] . In human ovary , specifically in follicular fluid , high lev - els of MIF were also observed . It was attributed to the granulosa cells present , which have been shown to manifest potential for de novo MIF synthesis . In - terestingly , in bigger follicles , level of MIF was low - er , suggesting that during maturation process gran - ulosa cells lose efficiency in MIF production . All this stays in accordance with observation that MIF can contribute to steroidogenesis via glucocorticoid and insulin - like growth factor I actions . It proves that MIF , apart from known function in immunological reactions , also plays a role in oocytes’ maturation through process of steroidogenesis mediated by the granulosa cells [ 25 ] . Finally , the last gene - Acyl - CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 6 ( ACSL6 ) mediates forma - tion of acyl - CoA from fatty acids , ATP and CoA . It is involved in fatty acid metabolism , especially in the brain , and takes part both in fatty acids synthesis and degradation . There are no reports describing the precise function of ACSL6 in oocyte physiol - ogy , however it was shown that loss of ACSL fam - Budna et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 54 ily member activity , in general , caused premature ovarian failure ( POF ) in Xenopus laevis by impairing meiotic arrest and speeding up oocyte maturation . It means that proper activity of ACSL synthetases may be responsible for maintaining physiological pool of arrested oocytes [ 26 ] . All genes belonging to fatty acid associated ontol - ogy groups showed significant down - regulation in porcine oocytes after IVM , in comparison to oocytes before IVM . Considering few information about these genes in relation to oocyte maturation , or even repro - ductive events , we cannot clearly correlate obtained results with mentioned processes . However , signif - icant changes in gene expression point to their po - tential role as an oocyte developmental competence markers in pigs . Molecular diagnostics could be the prospective tool for selection of best gametes , thus leading to improved outcome of in vitro fertilization .
