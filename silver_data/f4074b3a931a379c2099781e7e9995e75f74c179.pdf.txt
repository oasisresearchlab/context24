Skau 1 and David R . Kovar 1 , 2 , * 1 Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology 2 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology The University of Chicago , Chicago , IL 60637 , USA Summary Background : Tropomyosin is an important actin ﬁlament - stabilizing protein that controls the access of other essential proteins to ﬁlaments , including myosin motors , Arp2 / 3 complex , formin , and coﬁlin . It is therefore critical to establish mechanisms for regulating the actin ﬁlament binding of tropo - myosin . We examined how the actin ﬁlament crosslinking protein ﬁmbrin Fim1p and tropomyosin Cdc8p affect each other’s ability to bind ﬁlaments , localize to particular cellular structures , and regulate ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin Adf1p in ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Results : We discovered a novel mechanism for regulating actin ﬁlament dynamics in ﬁssion yeast . Fim1p inhibits Cdc8p binding to actin ﬁlaments in vitro , which permits Adf1p - mediated severing in the presence of Cdc8p . In cells , the balance between Fim1p and Cdc8p is important for both endocytic actin patch kinetics and contractile ring assembly during cytokinesis . High Fim1p concentrations prevent Cdc8p from associating with actin patches , allowing rapid patch turnover and motility . In the absence of Fim1p , ectopic localization of Cdc8p to actin patches increases patch lifetime while decreasing patch motility . Fim1p and Cdc8p also play antagonistic roles during cytokinesis , in which the deletion of Fim1p rescues the contractile ring assembly defects caused by mutation of Cdc8p . Conclusion : Fimbrin Fim1p dissociates tropomyosin Cdc8p from actin ﬁlaments , permitting coﬁlin Adf1p - mediated severing . Therefore , we propose that in addition to actin ﬁlament crosslinking , Fim1p has a novel role as a positive actin - binding ‘‘selector’’ protein that promotes the access of other proteins to actin ﬁlaments by inhibiting Cdc8p . Introduction The ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe assembles actin ﬁlaments with precise architecture and dynamics to drive different processes , including Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent endocytic patches , and to drive formin - dependent polarizing cables and the cytokinetic contractile ring [ 1 ] . Partially over - lapping sets of actin - binding proteins are required for the establishment , maintenance , and disassembly of the actin ﬁlaments within these structures . A major challenge is to deter - mine how speciﬁc subgroups of actin - binding proteins localize to a particular structure and collectively inﬂuence actin ﬁlament architecture , dynamics , and function . For example , ﬁssion yeast contains a single copy of each of the actin ﬁlament crosslinking and stabilizing proteins ﬁmbrin Fim1p and tropomyosin Cdc8p , as well as the severing protein coﬁlin Adf1p [ 2 – 5 ] . Although these proteins all bind to the side of actin ﬁlaments , they are differentially utilized for speciﬁc cellular processes . First , Fim1p is abundant in endocytic actin patches , whereas Cdc8p is not [ 2 – 4 , 6 ] . Second , Cdc8p is absolutely required for contractile ring assembly [ 2 ] , but it is unclear whether Fim1p plays a direct role in cytokinesis despite its localization to the division site [ 3 , 4 ] . Third , Adf1p is important for both endocytic actin patches and contractile ring assembly [ 5 ] , although the rate of actin ﬁlament turnover is faster in actin patches than the contractile ring . Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches , we discovered a novel paradigm for controlling actin ﬁlament dynamics in ﬁssion yeast . In addition to ﬁlament crosslinking , ﬁmbrin Fim1p is a ‘‘selector’’ protein that controls the access of other proteins to actin ﬁlaments . Speciﬁcally , we found that Fim1p prevents tropomyosin Cdc8p from binding to actin ﬁlaments , permitting coﬁlin Adf1p - mediated severing . There - fore , the balance between Fim1p and Cdc8p is important for both endocytic actin patches and contractile ring assembly . By preventing Cdc8p from associating with actin patches , Fim1p allows rapid patch turnover and motility . Fim1p also antagonizes Cdc8p during contractile ring assembly , possibly promoting a limited amount of actin ﬁlament severing , which is necessary for cytokinesis . Results Fim1p Displaces Cdc8p from Actin Filaments In Vitro Although ﬁssion yeast ﬁmbrin Fim1p and tropomyosin Cdc8p both bind actin ﬁlaments with submicromolar afﬁnity [ 3 , 6 – 9 ] , they preferentially localize to different actin - dependent structures in cells [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] . To examine the basis for this phenomenon , we utilized in vitro cosedimentation assays to determine how puriﬁed Fim1p and Cdc8p inﬂuence each other’s ability to bind actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 1 ; see also Fig - ures S1 – S3 available online ) . Cdc8p binds to and sediments with actin ﬁlaments following high - speed ultracentrifugation at 100 , 000 3 g ( Figure 1A ) . However , a range of Fim1p concentrations reduces the amount of Cdc8p in the actin pellet ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . Maximal displacement of Cdc8p from ﬁlaments occurs at w 5 m M Fim1p ( w 1 . 5 : 1 Fim1p to actin ) , a concentration at which ﬁlaments are essentially saturated with Fim1p ( Fig - ure 1B ) . Fim1p prevents Cdc8p from binding actin ﬁlaments , whether Fim1p is added to ﬁlaments before Cdc8p , simulta - neously with Cdc8p , or after Cdc8p ( Figure 1B ) . Therefore , Cdc8p binds actin ﬁlaments with a K d of w 40 nM in the absence of Fim1p , whereas no detectable binding of Cdc8p to actin ﬁlaments occurs in the presence of saturating amounts of Fim1p ( Figure S1 ) . Because Fim1p is an actin ﬁlament crosslinking protein [ 3 , 9 ] , we performed low - speed centrifugation assays at 10 , 000 3 g ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . In the absence of Fim1p , un - bundled actin ﬁlaments and Cdc8p remain in the supernatant . Fim1p has a biphasic effect on the appearance of Cdc8p in the low - speed pellet . Fim1p concentrations up to 250 nM progres - sively increase the amount of Cdc8p in the pellet , whereas * Correspondence : drkovar @ uchicago . edu Fim1p concentrations over 250 nM progressively remove Cdc8p from the pellet ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Therefore , Cdc8p and Fim1p can simultaneously bind actin ﬁlaments at an optimal low Fim1p concentration that is capable of forming bundles but not inhibiting Cdc8p ( w 3 : 1 : 0 . 25 , actin : Cdc8p : Fim1p ) . However , a plot of the ratio of Cdc8p to actin in the low - speed pellet over a range of Fim1p concentrations veriﬁes that Fim1p displaces Cdc8p from actin ﬁlaments by similar amounts , whether spun at high or low speed ( Figure 1D ) . Utilizing a truncated version of Fim1p ( Fim1A2p ) that contains only the second of two actin - binding domains , we veriﬁed that dissociation of Cdc8p from actin ﬁlaments is not dependent upon crosslinking by Fim1p ( Figure S2 ) . Conversely , Cdc8p does not affect the ability of Fim1p to bind or bundle actin ﬁlaments ( Figure S3 ) . Fim1p Prevents Cdc8p from Localizing to Endocytic Actin Patches Fim1p is highly enriched at endocytic actin patches , whereas Cdc8p is not [ 2 – 4 , 6 , 7 , 10 ] . We examined the ability of Fim1p to inhibit the localization of Cdc8p to actin patches by observing integrated GFP - Cdc8p in live cells ( Figure 2 ) . GFP - Cdc8p associates primarily with the contractile ring in wild - type cells ( Figures 2A and 2B ) [ 6 ] . However , in the absence of Fim1p ( ﬁm1 D cells ) , GFP - Cdc8p localizes to the contractile ring and to discrete puncta focused near the tips of interphase cells ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . To determine whether the GFP - Cdc8p puncta are endocytic actin patches , we visualized GFP - Cdc8p with the actin patch component ARPC5 - mCherry , a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 2C – 2E ) . In wild - type cells , GFP - Cdc8p does not co - localize with ARPC5 - mCherry ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . However , in interphase ﬁm1 D cells , GFP - Cdc8p localizes to about 85 % of ARPC5 - mCherry actin patches ( Figures 2C – 2E ) . We con - ﬁrmed that colocalization represents individual motile actin patches by time - lapse imaging ( Figure 2D ; Movie S1 ) .

( D ) Plot of the fraction of Cdc8p in the low - speed pellet ( - ) and the ratio of Cdc8p to actin in the low - speed pellet ( B ) over a range of Fim1p concentrations . Interestingly , GFP - Cdc8p colocalizes with ARPC5 - mCherry at less than 20 % of actin patches in dividing ﬁm1 D cells ( Figure 2E ) . Therefore , Cdc8p is ex - cluded from endocytic actin patches by Fim1p and is potentially recruited to actin ﬁlaments in the contractile ring . Actin Patch Dynamics Are Disrupted in the Absence of Fim1p , Largely because of Ectopic Cdc8p Accumulation We next examined actin patch behavior in the absence of Fim1p ( Figure 3 ) . Wild - type cells efﬁciently uptake the lipo - philic dye FM4 - 64 within 20 min ( Figures 3A and 3B ) , whereas endocytosis of FM4 - 64 is signiﬁcantly reduced in ﬁm1 D cells ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Using the general actin marker GFP - CHD ( rng2 ) [ 11 ] , we tracked the lifetime and movement of individual interphase patches ( Figures 3C – 3E ; Movie S2 ) . GFP - CHD ( rng2 ) - labeled wild - type patches exist for w 20 s , and 95 % propel into the cell interior ( Figures 3C and 3D ) [ 12 ] . Actin patches in ﬁm1 D cells subsist twice as long ( w 40 s ) , and less than 20 % propel into the cell interior ( Figures 3C – 3E ) . Actin patch defects in ﬁm1 D cells could be due to the absence of Fim1p and / or the ectopic presence of Cdc8p . We tested whether reducing the amount of Cdc8p in patches , via the tropomyosin temperature - sensitive mutant cdc8 - 27 [ 13 ] , corrects patch dynamics in ﬁm1 D cells . We found that patch dynamics in ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant cells at the semi - permissive temperature of 30 (cid:1) C are signiﬁcantly restored ( Figures 4A – 4D ; Figure S4 ) . First , whereas actin patches are abnormally retained at cell tips in ﬁm1 D cells , actin patch distribution is largely corrected in ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 cells ( Figure S4 ) . Second , actin patch lifetime is signiﬁcantly restored from w 25 s in ﬁm1 D cells to w 12 s in ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant cells ( Figures 4A and 4B ; Movie S3 ) . Third , patch motility from the cortex to the cell interior is substantially rescued in ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 cells ( Figure 4C ) . However , patches do not appear to regain full wild - type motility in ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 cells , and endocytosis defects similar to ﬁm1 D cells persist ( Figure 4D ) . Therefore , both the ectopic presence of Cdc8p and the loss of Fim1p - mediated actin ﬁlament bundling likely contribute to patch defects . Current Biology Vol 20 No 16 1416 The Balance between Fim1p and Cdc8p Plays a Role in Cytokinesis Although Fim1p localizes primarily to endocytic patches , Fim1p is also suspected to play a role in cytokinesis [ 14 ] . Fim1p localizes to the division site [ 3 , 4 ] , possibly the contrac - tile ring [ 3 ] . Deletion of Fim1p causes mild growth defects and is synthetic lethal with deletion of the major cytokinesis actin crosslinking protein a - actinin [ 3 , 4 ] . We therefore examined whether Fim1p also antagonizes Cdc8p during cytokinesis ( Figure 5 ) . The temperature - sensitive mutant cdc8 - 27 has severe cytokinesis defects at the semipermissive temperature of 32 (cid:1) C ( Figure 5A ) [ 2 , 13 ] . We found that the ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant partially suppresses the severe cytokinesis defects of cdc8 - 27 at 32 (cid:1) C , as quantiﬁed by several criteria ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . First , the total area of cdc8 - 27 cells is w 5 - fold greater than ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant cells . Second , more than 95 % of cdc8 - 27 cells contain more than two nuclei , compared with only 25 % of ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 cells . Third , at least 99 % of septa are abnormal ( misplaced , misor - iented , or unusually broad ) in cdc8 - 27 cells , compared with w 70 % abnormal septa in ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 cells . The Absence of Fim1p Rescues Contractile Ring Assembly Defects in a Cdc8p Mutant We determined the stage of cytokinesis at which Cdc8p and Fim1p have antagonistic roles by imaging live cells over time ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . Cytokinesis in ﬁssion yeast occurs through the coordinated progression of several major events that include prering cytokinesis node formation ( broad band ) , completion of contractile ring assembly ( sharp ring ) , constriction initiation , constriction completion ( septum forma - tion complete ) , disappearance of contractile ring components , and cell separation [ 14 – 16 ] . We measured the kinetics of cytokinesis in wild - type , ﬁm1 D , cdc8 - 27 , and ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 mutants at the semipermissive temperature of 30 (cid:1) C using differential interference contrast ( DIC ) and ﬂuorescence microscopy of the general actin marker GFP - CHD ( rng2 ) ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . Wild - type cells complete cytokinesis and undergo daughter cell separation w 75 min after actin ﬂuorescence ﬁrst appears at the division site ( Figure 5D ) [ 15 , 16 ] . Contractile rings in ﬁm1 D cells assemble and constrict with similar timing as wild - type , but signiﬁcant delays emerge at daughter cell separation ( Figure 5D ) . This late delay suggests defects in actin patch - mediated delivery of septum components to the division site , consistent with Fim1p’s major role in actin patch dynamics ( Figure 3 ) . In mutant cdc8 - 27 cells , the early step of contractile ring assembly from the broad band of prering cyto - kinesis nodes is signiﬁcantly delayed ( Figure 5D ) [ 15 , 17 ] , whereas later steps proceed normally . Removal of Fim1p rescues this early defect , because ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant cells do not have contractile ring assembly delays ( Fig - ure 5D ) . Similarly , ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant cells have a partial rescue of daughter cell separation defects seen in ﬁm1 D cells ( Figure 5D ) . Therefore , Fim1p and Cdc8p have fim1 ∆ 00 2 . 42 . 4 4 . 84 . 8 7 . 27 . 2 9 . 69 . 6 GFP - Cdc8p fim1 ∆ GFP - Cdc8p A C B D GFP - Cdc8p ARPC5 - mCherry fim1 ∆ GFP - Cdc8p ARPC5 - mCherry ARPC5 - mCherry Wild - Type GFP - Cdc8p Merge Wild - Type fim1 ∆ 0 5 10 15 20 Position ( µm ) 90 95 100 105 110 115 F l u o r e s c e n c e ( a . u . ) GFP - Cdc8p fim1 ∆ GFP - Cdc8p 0 2 . 42 . 4 4 . 84 . 8 7 . 27 . 2 9 . 69 . 6 GFP - Cdc8p GFP - Cdc8p Interphase Dividing 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 P a t c h e s w i t h F l u o r e s c e n c e ( % ) fim1 ∆ GFP - Cdc8p ARPC5 - mCherry E Figure 2 .

Fimbrin Inhibits Tropomyosin 1417 antagonistic roles during the contractile ring assembly and cell separation steps of cytokinesis . Fim1p Allows Adf1p - Mediated Severing in the Presence of Cdc8p We next investigated one possible mechanism by which competition between Fim1p and Cdc8p inﬂuences actin patch and contractile ring assembly kinetics . The actin ﬁlament - severing protein coﬁlin is the primary facilitator of rapid actin turnover in yeast actin patches [ 18 ] . Tropomyosins inhibit coﬁlin - mediated severing [ 19 , 20 ] , and overexpression of Cdc8p delocalizes coﬁlin Adf1p from contractile rings in ﬁssion yeast [ 5 ] . Therefore , we hypothesized that Fim1p might allow Adf1p - mediated severing by preventing Cdc8p from DIC FM4 - 64 Wild - Type fim1 ∆ D Wild - Type fim1 ∆ 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 I n t e r n a l F l u o r e s c e n c e ( a . u . ) A B 00 4 . 8 4 . 8 9 . 6 9 . 6 14 . 4 14 . 4 19 . 2 19 . 2 2424 28 . 8 28 . 8 0 4 . 8 4 . 8 9 . 6 9 . 6 14 . 4 14 . 4 19 . 2 19 . 2 2424 28 . 8 28 . 8 33 . 6 33 . 6 38 . 4 38 . 4 43 . 2 43 . 2 48 . 0 48 . 0 52 . 8 52 . 8 57 . 6 57 . 6 62 . 4 62 . 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 L i f e t i m e ( s e c ) Average Lifetime Wild - Type fim1 ∆ E FM4 - 64 Uptake Wild - Type fim1 ∆ Wild - Type fim1 ∆ C 200 n m * Figure 3 .

We ﬁrst established that the balance of Fim1p and Cdc8p does regulate actin ﬁlament turnover . The absence of Fim1p signiﬁcantly reduces the rate of latrunculin A ( LatA ) - mediated actin ﬁlament disassembly in actin patches , which is corrected by the partial loss of Cdc8p ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . We then examined the ability of Cdc8p to protect actin ﬁlaments from Adf1p in vitro in both the absence and presence of Fim1p . We began by visualizing the lengths of preassem - bled actin ﬁlaments following incubation with a range of concentrations of Adf1p for 30 min ( Figure S5 ) . We found that Adf1p efﬁciently reduces actin ﬁlament length in either the absence or presence of 250 nM Fim1p . On the other hand , 3 . 0 m M Cdc8p inhibits the reduction in ﬁlament length over a range of Adf1p concentrations up to 5 . 0 m M . In the presence of both Cdc8p and Fim1p , Adf1p reduces the average ﬁlament length by the same amount as in the presence of Fim1p only ( Figure S5 ) . We veriﬁed that Fim1p allows Adf1p - mediated severing in the presence of Cdc8p by directly observing actin ﬁlament severing with total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Figures 6C and 6D ; Movie S4 ) . We found that although 3 . 0 m M Cdc8p inhibits severing by 150 nM Adf1p , the severing rate is signiﬁcantly increased in the presence of both Cdc8p and 250 nM Fim1p . These results are consistent with a mechanism whereby Fim1p allows coﬁlin - mediated severing by dissociating Cdc8p . In ﬁssion yeast , Adf1p - mediated severing is thought to be important for both contractile ring assembly and endocytic patch dynamics [ 3 , 5 , 21 ] . As expected , we found that mutations in both Fim1p and Adf1p synergistically impair actin patches ( Figures 6E and 6F ) . By visualizing the general actin marker GFP - CHD ( rng2 ) , we monitored patch dynamics in wild - type , ﬁm1 D , adf1 - 1 [ 5 ] , and ﬁm1 D adf1 - 1 double mutant cells at 25 (cid:1) C ( Figures 6E and 6F ; Movie S5 ) . Patch lifetime is signiﬁcantly longer in ﬁm1 D adf1 - 1 double mutant cells ( > 70 s ) than ﬁm1 D ( w 20 to 40 s ) and adf1 - 1 ( w 20 to 40 s ) single mutant cells ( Movie S5 ) . These data are consistent with the model whereby the ability of Fim1p to remove Cdc8p from actin ﬁlaments is critical for allowing severing by Adf1p in vivo . Discussion We have discovered that , in addition to actin ﬁlament cross - linking , ﬁmbrin Fim1p plays an unexpected role in ﬁssion yeast by inhibiting the binding of tropomyosin Cdc8p to actin ﬁla - ments ; therefore , the balance between Fim1p and Cdc8p is critical in cells .

Fimbrin Inhibits Tropomyosin 1419 turnover at both endocytic actin patches and at assembling contractile rings by antagonizing Cdc8p , which in part ‘‘depro - tects’’ actin ﬁlaments from coﬁlin Adf1p - mediated severing ( Figure 7 ) . Competition between Fim1p and Cdc8p represents a functionally novel paradigm for controlling actin dynamics and architecture in cells by selecting access of other proteins to ﬁlaments . In addition to regulating severing , the balance between Fim1p and Cdc8p might also delineate actin ﬁlament access for a range of other functionally important proteins , including nucleation factors ( Arp2 / 3 complex and formin ) , myosin motors ( Clayton et al . [ 22 ] , this issue of Current Biology ) , and ﬁlament crosslinkers ( a - actinin and formin ) . Role of Fim1p in Endocytosis Endocytic actin patches in yeast are thought to be structurally and functionally similar to the leading edge of a migrating cell , where rapid Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated assembly of short - branched actin ﬁlaments coupled to coﬁlin - mediated actin ﬁlament disassembly pushes clathrin - coated vesicles inward from the cortex [ 23 – 25 ] . Fimbrin is a major component of actin patches in both budding yeast and ﬁssion yeast [ 3 , 4 , 26 , 27 ] . In ﬁssion yeast , the concentration of Fim1p at actin patches ( 100 m M ) is almost 20 times the global cytoplasmic concentra - tion [ 10 ] . Loss of ﬁmbrin in both yeasts results in endocytosis failure because actin patches exhibit severe kinetic defects , C D F E Wild - Type adf1 - 1 fim1 ∆ adf1 - 1 fim1 ∆ 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 P a t c h e s ( % ) Wild - Type fim1 ∆ adf1 - 1 adf1 - 1 fim1 ∆ 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 1212 1212 1212 1212 1616 1616 1616 1616 2020 2020 2020 2424 2424 2424 2828 2828 2828 3232 3232 3232 3636 3636 3636 4040 4040 4444 4444 4848 4848 5252 5252 5656 5656 6060 6464 6868 Patch Lifetime Adf1p Adf1p + Fim1p Adf1p + Cdc8p Adf1p + Fim1p + Cdc8p 0 . 0005 0 . 0010 0 . 0015 0 . 000 S e v e r i n g R a t e ( b r e a k s u m - 1 s - 1 ) Adf1p Adf1p + Fim1p Adf1p + Cdc8p Adf1p + Fim1p + Cdc8p T i m e ( s ) 0 s0 s 100 s 100 s 200 s 200 s Severing Rate A B 0 min 5 min Wild - Type fim1 ∆ cdc8 - 27 fim1 ∆ cdc8 - 27 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 F l u o r e s c e n c e R e m a i n i n g ( % ) Wild - Type cdc8 - 27 fim1 ∆ fim1 ∆ cdc8 - 27 * * * < 20 s 21 - 40 s > 40 s * * * Figure 6 .

( F ) Plot of actin patch lifetime binned in 20 s intervals ( n = 30 patches for each strain ) . including a doubled lifetime and failure to move away from the cortex ( Figure 3 ; [ 27 , 28 ] ) . Given that ﬁssion yeast Fim1p and budding yeast ﬁmbrin Sac6 belong to a well - established class of ﬁlament crosslinkers [ 4 , 29 ] , the simplest inter - pretation is that ﬁmbrin’s role for endocytic patches is to crosslink actin ﬁlaments . However , we found that the removal of Fim1p results in ectopic association of Cdc8p with actin patches ( Figure 2 ) . Impor - tantly , reducing the concentration of Cdc8p with a tempera - ture - sensitive mutant largely corrects actin patch dynamics in ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant cells ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , the presence of Cdc8p is a major contributor to patch defects in the absence of Fim1p . This is consistent with previous reports indicating that budding yeast actin patches are composed of short - branched unbundled ﬁlaments [ 30 ] . Because Arp2 / 3 nucleates branches at a 70 (cid:1) angle relative to the mother ﬁlaments and because the combined actions of actin capping protein and coﬁlin keep ﬁlament lengths at about 50 nm , ﬁmbrin may not be able to form crosslinks in patches . On the other hand , given that endocytosis of the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 is not fully recovered in the ﬁm1 D cdc8 - 27 double mutant ( Figure 4D ) , the crosslinking activity of Fim1p is likely important . Recent evidence from budding yeast suggests that actin bundling is important for functional endocytic patches [ 31 ] . Alternatively , it is possible that residual amounts of Cdc8p remain on patches at the semipermissive tempera - ture of 30 (cid:1) C or that Fim1p is also required to regulate association of additional actin ﬁlament - binding proteins such as a - actinin , transgelin , or IQGAP with patches [ 4 , 9 , 32 ] . Current Biology Vol 20 No 16 1420 Roles of Cdc8p and Fim1p in Cytokinesis Tropomyosin Cdc8p is essential for cytokinesis ( Figure 2 ; Figure 5 ) [ 2 , 6 , 13 ] , whereas it has been unclear whether Fim1p plays any role in the assembly or constriction of the contractile ring . Fim1p localizes to the division site , and deletion of ﬁm1 is synthetically lethal with deletion of the contractile ring bundling protein a - actinin [ 3 , 4 ] . Our results demonstrate that the balance between Fim1p and Cdc8p is important for contractile ring assembly , possibly to allow limited Adf1p - mediated actin ﬁlament severing ( Figure 7 ) . One hypothesis is that contractile ring assembly in ﬁssion yeast occurs by the coalescence of w 65 prering cytokinesis nodes , which are interconnected through the activities of node components formin Cdc12p and myosin - II Myo2p [ 14 , 16 , 21 ] . Cdc12p stimulates actin ﬁlament assembly at nodes and remains processively associated with the elon - gating ﬁlament [ 33 ] . Myo2p on adjacent nodes captures the pointed end of Cdc12p - associated actin ﬁlaments , and nodes are pulled together through successive rounds of tran - sient Myo2p - mediated pulling and breaking of the node connections [ 14 ] . The balance between periods of pulling and detachment is critical [ 21 , 34 ] . Node connection could be broken by dissociation of either Myo2p or Cdc12p from the ﬁlament or by coﬁlin Adf1p - medi - ated ﬁlament severing . The importance of Adf1p - mediated severing in contractile ring assembly has been established [ 5 , 21 ] . Our results indicate that ﬁlament severing could be regulated by limited removal of inhibitory Cdc8p by Fim1p ( Figure 7 ) . Supporting this , overexpression of Fim1p results in loss of the contractile ring and severe cytokinesis defects ( unpublished data ) [ 3 , 4 ] . However , because ﬁm1 D cells do not have major cytokinesis defects , we predict that other contractile ring components such as a - actinin and IQGAP Rng2p may also regulate Adf1p - mediated severing . In addition to inhibiting severing ( Figure 6 ) [ 5 ] , Cdc8p also regulates the cytokinesis myosin motor Myo2p and the cytoki - nesis formin Cdc12p [ 6 , 8 , 17 ] . Cdc8p theoretically lowers the number of Myo2p molecules required for processive coales - cence of the contractile ring cytokinesis nodes by stabilizing the strong actin - bound state of Myo2p [ 17 ] . On the other hand , Cdc8p also allows Cdc12p - associated ﬁlaments to elon - gate twice as fast and to anneal end to end [ 8 ] . Therefore , Cdc8p appears to inﬂuence multiple aspects of contractile ring assembly in ﬁssion yeast . Because the relative amounts of actin - binding proteins in particular cellular structures are critical , it is interesting to consider what regulates the amount of Fim1p and Cdc8p in the contractile ring . Endocytic actin patches may serve as sinks that accumulate Fim1p , and / or Fim1p may have an increased afﬁnity for Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent branched actin ﬁlaments . Additionally , contractile ring proteins such as the actin ﬁlament crosslinking proteins a - actinin and IQGAP Rng2p may inhibit Fim1p . Conversely , Cdc8p prefers contrac - tile ring ﬁlaments to actin patch ﬁlaments ( Figure 2E ) , suggest - ing that Cdc8p is positively recruited to the contractile ring . Cdc8p binds more tightly to actin ﬁlaments nucleated by the cytokinesis formin Cdc12p [ 8 ] , but other factors may also contribute to the recruitment of Cdc8p to the contractile ring . Interaction among Actin - Binding Proteins Determines Actin Architecture We revealed a novel paradigm for the regulation of coﬁlin - mediated actin severing through the competition between actin ﬁlament side - binding proteins ﬁmbrin and tropomyosin . Additionally , these results demonstrate that interpretation of mutant phenotypes of actin - binding proteins can be extremely complicated . It may be necessary to determine how deletion of one actin - binding protein affects the localization of others , not only the proteins thought to play a role in the same process . In addition to Fim1p , Cdc8p , and Adf1p , ﬁssion yeast contains many other proteins that bind to the side of actin ﬁlaments and localize to speciﬁc cellular structures , including Arp2 / 3 complex , myosin , a - actinin , transgelin Stg1p , IQGAP Rng2p , coronin , and Aip1 . Therefore , in addition to coﬁlin - mediated severing and myosin motor activity [ 22 ] , numerous complex interactions remain to be sorted . Our results shed light on a mechanism by which interaction between actin - binding proteins may control global actin organization and dynamics . Experimental Procedures Microscopy of Actin Patches and Cytokinesis For actin patch dynamics , cells grown in Edinburgh minimal media ( EMM ) liquid media were spotted onto EMM pads containing 25 % gelatin on glass slides , sealed with VALAP , and imaged in the Z direction with 0 . 1 m m slices or in time - lapse every 165 ms in the GFP channel . Analysis of patch dynamics was quantiﬁed for 25 randomly chosen cells for each strain using ImageJ software ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . Only patches that originated and disappeared during the course of the movie were quantiﬁed . For confocal microscopy of actin patch dynamics , images were acquired with a 403 / 0 . 75 NA objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with a Yoko - gawa CSU - 10 spinning - disk unit ( McBain ) and illuminated with a 50 mW 473 nm DPSS laser ( Cobolt ) . Time - lapse acquisitions were captured at 1 . 2 s intervals on a Cascade 512B electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( Photometrics ) with MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Patch dynamics were quantiﬁed with ImageJ and previously described software [ 35 ] . Final numbers of patches analyzed per strain are indicated in the ﬁgure legends . For cytokinesis , time - lapse imaging and analysis have been reported [ 15 , 36 ] . Cells were spotted onto EMM pads containing 25 % gelatin , sealed with VALAP , and imaged once per minute in both DIC and GFP channels for Endocytosis , actin patches + Rapid filament turnover Actin Arp2 / 3 ( 1 ) Arp2 / 3 High Fim1p High Adf1p Little Cdc8p Cytokinesis , contractile ring assembly Limitedfilament turnover + Myosin II Formin ( 2 ) Low Fim1p Low Adf1p High Cdc8p Actin Figure 7 . Cartoon Model for Regulation of Adf1p - Mediated Severing by Fim1p and Cdc8p in Fission Yeast ( 1 ) At endocytic actin patches , high concentrations of Fim1p allow efﬁcient Adf1p - mediated severing by preventing Cdc8p from binding to Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin ﬁlaments . In the absence of Fim1p , ectopic localization of Cdc8p to patches slows patch dynamics by inhibiting ﬁlament severing . Cdc8p may also inhibit actin ﬁlament nucleation by Arp2 / 3 . ( 2 ) During contractile ring assembly , lower concentrations of Fim1p allow limited actin ﬁlament severing by partially inhibiting Cdc8p . Previous studies have suggested that severing is necessary for contractile ring assembly despite the presence of high concentrations of Cdc8p [ 5 , 21 ] . Fimbrin Inhibits Tropomyosin 1421 at least 2 hr . Analysis of ring assembly was quantiﬁed for at least 10 randomly chosen cells for each strain using ImageJ software . Temperature was controlled using an air stream stage incubator ( Nevtek ) or an objective heater ( BiOptechs ) .
