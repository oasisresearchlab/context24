Using the American Physical Society data and computational methods , we analyze the impact of knowledge spanning on both citation counts and disruptive innovation . The findings show that knowledge spanning has a U - shaped impact on disruptive innovation . In contrast , there is an inverted U - shaped relationship between knowledge spanning and citation counts , and the inverted U - shaped effect is moderated by team size . This study contributes to the theories of knowledge recombination by suggesting that both intellectual conformism and knowledge recombination can lead to disruptive innovation . That is , when evaluating the quality of scientific research with disruptive innovation , the essential tension seems to disappear . Keywords : Knowledge Recombination , Category Spanning , Disruption , Citation , Team Size 3 Introduction Innovation paves the way for scientific research ( Koestler , 1964 ; Nelson & Winter , 1982 ; Schumpeter , 1934 ) . However , according to the seminal work of Thomas Kuhn ( 1977 ) , there is an essential tension between tradition and innovation . Kuhn ( 1977 ) asserts that productive tradition and risky innovation are indispensable for scientific research . In line with this logic , prior studies keep finding that knowledge spanning has an inverted U - shaped impact on the impact or success of scientific research ( Foster et al . , 2015 ; Guan et al . , 2017 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) , patents ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) , musicals ( Uzzi & Spiro , 2005 ) , songs ( Askin & Mauskapf , 2017 ) , and questions ( Shi et al . , 2021 ) . These empirical findings of the essential tension illustrate the innovators’ dilemma in scientific research . However , prior research primarily focuses on the citation counts of scientific research rather than disruptive innovation ( Guan et al . , 2017 ; S . Wang et al . , 2021 ; Zhu et al . , 2021 ) . Although citation counts are simple and intuitive , they suffer from a series of unintended problems , such as ignoring negative citations ( Catalini et al . , 2015 ) , increasing citation inequality ( Nielsen & Andersen , 2021 ) , and encouraging the strategic choice of conservative research ( Foster et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , we formulate the key puzzlement of this research as follows : if we evaluate the quality of scientific research with disruptiveness , does the essential tension ( i . e . , the inverted U - shaped impact of knowledge spanning ) still exist ? If the logic of scientific research driven by citation counts is not balanced by fostering disruptive scholarship , the progress of scientific research would be trapped in the existing canon . Foster and his colleagues ( 2015 ) find that high - risk innovation strategies are rare in biomedical research . Rzhetsky et al . ( 2015 ) analyze biomedical research over 30 years , and further find that biomedical researchers pursue conservative research strategies , which slows scientific advances . By analyzing the Web of Science articles published between 1954 and 2014 , Wu et al . ( 2019 ) show that the disruptiveness of scientific research decreases over time . 4 Similarly , Chu and Evans ( 2021 ) find that scientists in a field are more inclined to develop existing ideas than propose disruptive ( or highly disruptive ) ones . Although the number of published scientific research increases over time , the central ideas in a field have not been changed ; In contrast , canonical research has a durable dominance in terms of garnering new citations ( Chu & Evans , 2021 ) . In all , using citation counts to evaluate the quality of scientific research tends to encourage the strategic selection of traditional research . To address this theoretical puzzlement , we draw our research on the theories of knowledge recombination ( Nelson & Winter , 1982 ) and category spanning ( Hannan , 2010 ; Hannan & Freeman , 1977a ; Hsu et al . , 2009 ) . We define knowledge spanning as one form of knowledge recombination in terms of knowledge space . Using the computational methods of word embeddings and network analysis , we model the knowledge space as a high - dimensional geometric space or a tree . Meanwhile , we trace how each scientific research spans the boundary of knowledge space and quantify its extent of knowledge spanning . Specifically , we calculate two types of measures of knowledge spanning : geometric distance and network distance . According to the scope and direction of recombination , we further classify them into internal knowledge spanning and external knowledge spanning . Internal knowledge spanning refers to the scope covered by the categories of scientific research in the knowledge space . The larger the coverage in the knowledge space , the greater the internal knowledge spanning . Thus , the internal knowledge spanning measures the step size of scientific research . However , it fails to capture the direction of research that is more critical for scientific progress . The research aligning with the direction of the paradigm tends to be conventional . While the research deviates from the direction of the paradigm tends to be more disruptive . Following this logic , we define external knowledge spanning as the extent to which scientific research deviates from the mainstream paradigm . Finally , we analyze the impact of knowledge spanning on citation counts and disruptive innovation . 5 We claim that the existence of the essential tension between tradition and innovation depends on how we evaluate the quality of scientific research . Testing the hypotheses using the APS data set ( American Physical Society , 2021 ) , this present research contributes to prior research in the following aspects : First , we reformulate the puzzlement of the essential tension by distinguishing scientific credit into citation counts and disruptive innovation . Surprisingly , our findings show that although knowledge spanning has an inverted U - shaped impact on the popularity of scientific research , it has a U - shaped impact on the disruption of scientific research . Thus , the essential tension disappears when we evaluate the quality of scientific research with disruptive innovation . Both the lower level and higher level of knowledge spanning can breed more disruptive innovation . Therefore , disruptive innovation prefers both lower and higher level of knowledge spanning than a mixture of them . Second , given that team size plays a crucial role in scientific research , we have also considered the impact of team size . On the one hand , we support prior research on the main effect of team size ( Wu et al . , 2019 ; Wuchty et al . , 2007 ) . On the other hand , we further show that team size moderates the impact of knowledge spanning on citation counts . In all , this study contributes to the theories of knowledge recombination by unpacking the essential tension proposed by Kuhn ( 1977 ) . The other sections of this study are organized as follows : First , we review the literature and establish our theoretical framework based on knowledge recombination and team science . Second , based on this theoretical framework , we propose research hypotheses to answer the research puzzlement . Third , we introduce the dataset , measures , and models and test our hypotheses . Finally , we discuss our findings , limitations , implications , and conclusions . The Essential Tension and Knowledge Spanning We construct our theoretical framework based on the idea of the essential tension proposed by Thomas Kuhn ( 1977 ) . In the seminal work titled The Essential Tension , Kuhn ( 1977 ) argues 6 that both convergent and divergent thinking are essential to the progress of scientific research . Thus , there is a tradeoff between productive tradition and risky innovation . On the one hand , scientists are trained to be puzzle - solvers who follow tradition and selectively ignore most unexpected discoveries ; On the other hand , scientists are aware that their long - term reputation comes from their innovative discoveries ( Kuhn , 1977 ) . The lack of either tradition or innovation is harmful to the development of science . The legitimacy of normal science comes from the exemplars established by prior scientific revolutions ( Kuhn , 1962 ) . Kuhn ( 1962 ) conceptualizes these exemplars as the paradigm . The paradigm is like a compass that guides the scientific community on a planned route . We regard scientific tradition as a big ship carrying sailors who share the same vision about the direction of their expedition . According to Thomas Kuhn ( 1962 ) , normal science aims to extend the scope and precision of scientific knowledge rather than to establish novel facts or theories . The researchers of normal science are puzzle - solvers who limit their scopes to “ achieve the anticipated in a new way ” ( Kuhn , 1996 , p . 36 ) . The tasks of normal science are restricted to three categories : precisely determining the facts , matching facts with theories , and articulating theories ( Kuhn , 1996 , p . 34 ) . In addition , Kuhn ( 1962 ) proposes that the development of normal science is bound to undergo a process of professionalization . Professionalization is manifested in the establishment of sophisticated equipment , the improvement of skills , and the refinement of concepts and vocabulary ( Kuhn , 1962 ) . In all , tradition fixes the route of making scientific discoveries . As a result , it is reasonable to contend that there is less possibility of making discoveries on the road of such traditional research . However , and surprisingly , although Kuhn denies the role of innovation in normal science , he admits that innovation is an important feature of scientific research . “ New and unsuspected phenomena are , however , repeatedly uncovered by scientific research , and radical new theories have again and again been invented by scientists ” ( Kuhn , 1996 , p . 52 ) . 7 Kuhn ( 1962 ) further argues that the research under a paradigm can effectively induce new paradigm shifts . Discoveries emerge from old theories ( Kuhn , 1962 ) . In other words , only the innovations rooted in the scientific tradition can break the tradition and give rise to scientific revolutions . He attributes this unintended outcome to the professionalization of normal science that provides detailed information , improves the accuracy of observations , and makes the existence of anomalies more conclusive ( Kuhn , 1996 , p . 65 ) . As a result , paradigm change happens , new phenomena are discovered , and novel theories are constructed . According to this logic , paradigm change is only possible when normal science has experienced or even finished the professionalization process . We theorize the essential tension from the perspective of knowledge recombination ( Koestler , 1964 ; Nelson & Winter , 1982 ; Schumpeter , 1934 ) . Our understanding of innovation comes from Joseph Schumpeter’s exploration of the impact of technological innovation on economic development . Schumpeter considers innovation as implementing “new combinations” ( Schumpeter , 1934 , pp . 65 – 66 ) . In light of Joseph Schumpeter’s idea , Nelson and Winter further argue that the creation of novelty in science originates from the “recombination of conceptual and physical materials” ( Nelson & Winter , 1982 , p . 130 ) . Similarly , Koestler ( 1964 ) coins the term bisociation to describe this innovation process and asserts that creative ideas lie at the intersection of two frames of thought . Further , when the degree of knowledge recombination is relatively small , scientific research is more traditional ; On the contrary , scientific research is more innovative . Thus , the degree of knowledge recombination depicts the tension between tradition and innovation . Bourdieu ( 1975 ) views scientists as a function of their positions within the scientific field . The scientific field is one form of social field featured by the competitive struggle for scientific stakes or authority . Scientists make strategic choices to accumulate scientific capital ( e . g . , peer recognition ) and maximize productivity . Since innovation is risky and would be 8 punished for deviating from the dominating paradigm , a disposition toward tradition rather than innovation is a more rational choice . In this sense , innovation is more like a gamble . Foster et al . ( 2015 ) further illustrate the mechanisms of the essential tension based on Bourdieu’s field theory of science . By analyzing how biomedical researchers establish links between chemicals , they classify scientific strategies into three categories : consolidation , bridge , and jump . Although innovative research is more likely to achieve a higher impact ( measured by citation counts ) than a conservative one , it is rarely adopted by scientists because the reward of risky innovation can not offset the loss of rejection ( Foster et al . , 2015 ) . In light of the studies of category spanning ( Hannan , 2010 ; Hannan et al . , 2007 ; Hannan & Freeman , 1977b ; Hsu et al . , 2009 ) , we further operationalize knowledge recombination as knowledge spanning across categories . Categorization plays an essential role in scientific research . Scientific knowledge is categorized into different domains , and scientists are categorized into different communities . For example , keywords are widely used to organize , locate , and discover scientific research in the knowledge space . The keywords of scientific research constitute its coordinates in the knowledge space . Using keywords , readers can easily locate research in the knowledge space . Moreover , keywords can also indicate the scope of knowledge space a study covers and to what extent this study deviates from mainstream research . The categories of scientific research act as boundaries that hinder recombination in the knowledge space . Thus , knowledge spanning can be viewed as one kind of category spanning , reflecting the distance of boundary spanning in the knowledge space . According to prior research , our definition of knowledge spanning quantifies the novelty of scientific research ( J . Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Research Hypotheses According to prior research ( Askin & Mauskapf , 2017 ; Foster et al . , 2015 ; Guan et al . , 2017 ; Shi et al . , 2021 ; Uzzi & Spiro , 2005 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) , the essential tension proposed 9 by Kuhn ( 1977 ) suggests that there is a critical point between tradition and innovation . Specifically , there is an inverted U - shaped relationship between knowledge spanning and its impact . The inverted U - shape exists because there is negative feedback with the increase of knowledge spanning . On the one hand , if a study only spans a short distance in the knowledge space , it would be punished because it is boring , and the readers are less likely to read it . On the other hand , if a study spans a long distance in the knowledge space , it would be penalized because it is difficult to interpret , and the readers are unwilling to read it . Scientists need to be close to the critical point if they want to be successful . In contrast , their achievements will be constrained if they deviate from the critical point . Although there is an inevitable contradiction between tradition and innovation , successful scientists can maintain the essential tension between tradition and innovation . Thus , the essential tension provides a cost - benefit framework for understanding the impact of scientific innovations . For example , Foster et al . ( 2015 ) find an inverted U - shaped relation between the proportion of scientific strategy ( i . e . , jump , new bridge , repeat bridge , new consolidation , repeat consolidation ) per article and citation counts . Yan et al . ( 2020 ) find that both a paper’s new combinations ( i . e . , new pairs of knowledge elements in a related research area ) and new components ( i . e . , new knowledge elements that have never appeared in a related research area previously ) have an inverted U - shaped effect on its citation count . We posit that the existence of the essential tension between tradition and innovation depends on how we evaluate the quality of scientific research . The essential tension holds when we evaluate scientific research merely by citation counts . Thus , we propose the first hypothesis as follows : H1 : knowledge spanning has an inverted U - shaped impact on citation counts . The theory of category spanning explains the negative feedback of knowledge spanning from two aspects ( Keuschnigg & Wimmer , 2017 ) . First , knowledge spanning reduces researchers’ niche fitness . According to the degree of knowledge spanning , researchers can be 10 distinguished into specialists and generalists . Compared with specialists , the generalists or category spanners tend to be distracted and lose focus . Thus , it is more difficult for the generalists to accumulate experience and foster niche fitness ; Second , knowledge spanning increases the audience ' s confusion about scientific research . Scientists have a stable expectation of scientific research . From the perspective of symbolic interaction theory , scientists tend to understand scientific research from the perspective of their mental images ( Becker , 1998 ) . In addition to common sense , the education of scientists plays a vital role in constructing our mental images ( Kuhn , 1977 ) . Both common sense and domain knowledge reflect the logic of the dominant paradigm . Nevertheless , knowledge spanning means deviating from the paradigm and our mental images . Consequently , knowledge spanning increases cognitive difficulties in understanding scientific research . Nonetheless , by transforming the way of evaluation , we argue that it is possible to eliminate the essential tension ( i . e . , the negative feedback of knowledge spanning ) and transfer scientific research into a new track of innovation . In this study , we consider an alternative evaluation of citation counts—the disruptiveness of scientific research ( Funk & Owen - Smith , 2017 ; Wu et al . , 2019 ) . The intuition of disruptiveness is that disruptive innovation shifts scientists’ attention away from prior research ( Funk & Owen - Smith , 2017 ) . Using Plato ' s analogy , the mainstream paradigm is like the sun , emitting dazzling light . It is usually difficult for people to escape the rational sunshine . However , disruptive research can block the light of the sun , just like what the moon does during a solar eclipse . Disruptive innovation means a break or discontinuity with the current paradigm ( Lin et al . , 2022 ) . In short , disruptive innovation is a departure from the tradition , which blocks the influence of the dominant paradigm and forms a break or shift of collective attention . Knowledge spanning can help scientific research leap in the knowledge space . On the one hand , knowledge spanning can improve the generalists’ niche fitness in an ecosystem that 11 encourages innovations . On the other hand , disruptiveness means disengaging from the mainstream paradigm . Using disruptiveness as an evaluation metric helps build a new mental image that prefers novelty . Therefore , when we evaluate scientific research by its disruptiveness , the punishment for knowledge spanning could be reduced and even eliminated . We posit that the negative feedback of knowledge spanning will disappear . Based on the logic above , we propose the following research question : Q1 : what is the relationship between knowledge spanning and disruptive innovation ? Larger teams can receive more citations than smaller teams because the professionalization logic of normal science is more pronounced for larger teams ( Kuhn , 1962 ) . First , large teams are more likely to converge to incumbent paradigms ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Scientific teams are assembled to breed and test new ideas , but both team size and the impact of scientific teams have been increasing over time ( Wuchty et al . , 2007 ) . When teams get larger and the individual opinions get more diverse , reaching a consensus on the choice of research questions becomes more difficult to . Thus , larger teams tend to be more traditional than disruptive . Although the mission of innovators is to produce diverse ideas , deviating from the mainstream paradigm will be punished . Since disruptive research is often immature , the risks faced by smaller teams are even more deadly . Further , larger teams usually focus on the hot issues related to the dominating paradigm . Therefore , they can reap more attention and have a larger capability to attract citations than smaller teams . Second , through the division of labor , the members of larger teams can give free rein to their expertise , develop their strengths , and avoid their weaknesses . Thus , the research efficiency of larger teams is higher than smaller teams ( Zhu et al . , 2021 ) . Third , larger teams are often assembled around an experienced and prestigious researcher who occupies a higher position in the scientific field . Consequently , larger teams are generally more influential than smaller teams . In addition , larger teams can mobilize more resources ( Zhu et al . , 2021 ) . Together , larger teams have a stronger capability 12 to deal with risks and get more citations than smaller teams . Compared with larger teams , smaller teams are more likely to disrupt science and technology ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Smaller teams are like smaller boats that can flexibly turn around to explore diverse directions . If the comparative advantage of larger teams is to consolidate the incumbent paradigm through division of labor , the comparative advantage of smaller teams is to disrupt science through knowledge spanning . Smaller teams tend to disrupt science by searching deeper into the past , and larger teams tend to develop science by working on popular issues ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . The average age of the references cited by smaller teams is generally larger compared with larger teams . In contrast , the popularity of the references cited by smaller teams is weaker compared with larger teams ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Based on the logic above , we propose the hypotheses as follows : H2 : team size has a positive effect on citation counts ( H2a ) and a negative impact on disruptiveness ( H2b ) . The influence of knowledge spanning depends on how scientists collaborate . Team size plays a crucial role in the social interaction process among team members . For example , the structure of the scientific team is determined by team size . Using the individual contribution data , Haeussler and Sauermann ( 2020 ) find that larger teams have a larger share of specialists and a smaller share of generalists than smaller teams . Compared with the share of authors participating in empirical analysis , the share of authors participating in conceptualization and writing decreases significantly with the increased team size . As we have argued above , larger teams are characterized by a more potent logic of professionalization than smaller teams . On the one hand , the professionalization of larger teams would limit scientists’ horizons and hinder disruptive research . For example , Park and his colleagues ( 2021 ) quantify the narrowing scope of scientists by the decline in the cited references’ diversity , the increase in self - citation , and the increase in cited references’ mean 13 age . They argue that the narrowing scope of scientists places restrictions on the disruptiveness of scientific research , which is why the disruptiveness of scientific research has been declining in the past six decades ( Park et al . , 2021 ) . On the other hand , the professionalization of larger teams can make them more productive and influential . Arguably , team size can amplify the impact of knowledge spanning on citation counts . Focusing on the scientific impact of the scientist , Zhu , Liu , and Yang ( 2021 ) find that team size has an inverted - U shaped relationship with research impact ( i . e . , weighted average citations ) and research variety ( i . e . , the number of disciplinary categories covered by a focal scholar ) can moderate this nonlinear relationship . In comparison , we focus on the scientific impact of the individual scientific research , the predictor is the extent of knowledge spanning of the scientific research , and the moderation variable is the team size . Thus , we propose the following hypotheses : H3 : team size moderates the impact of knowledge spanning on citation counts ( H3a ) and disruptiveness ( H3b ) . Methods Data We use the American Physical Society ( APS ) dataset to quantify knowledge spanning as well as team size and examine their impact on scientific research . Founded in 1899 , APS publishes over ten journals of physical review series , such as Physical Review A ( PRA ) , Physical Review B ( PRB ) , Physical Review C ( PRC ) , Physical Review D ( PRD ) , Physical Review E ( PRE ) , Physical Review X ( PRX ) , Physical Review Letters ( PRL ) , Physical Review Special Topics - Physics Education Research ( PRSTPER ) , Physical Review Special Topics - Accelerators and Beams ( PRSTAB ) , and Reviews of Modern Physics ( RMP ) . The dataset contains 678 , 916 scientific papers published from 1977 to 2020 . 14 APS has started to use the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme ( PACS ) developed by the American Institute of Physics to classify the fields and sub - fields of research since 1975 . There are 441340 articles with the PACS code , published from 1977 to 2015 . Most papers published from 1980 to 2010 are labeled with five 6 - digital PACS codes . We consider the PACS codes as the categories of scientific research . The PACS codes of a paper demonstrate the recombination of categories . Using the PACS code , we measure knowledge spanning with both word embedding models and network analysis . Measures We employ word embedding models to embed the categories of research articles into the high - dimensional knowledge space . According to prior research ( Levy & Goldberg , 2014 ) , word embeddings are equivalent to pointwise mutual information ( PMI ) . Word embedding models are a particular form of neural language model which aims to embed words into a high - dimensional space ( Kozlowski et al . , 2019 ; Mikolov , Chen , et al . , 2013 ; Mikolov , Sutskever , et al . , 2013 ) . In this study , each PACS code of APS articles is viewed as a word , and the APS articles are viewed as documents . According to the logic of word embedding models , we distinguish the PACS codes into the center categories and their surrounding categories ( Mikolov , Chen , et al . , 2013 ) . 1 . The input of the neural network model is a sequence of center categories , and the output of the neural network model is the predicted surrounding categories : 2 . Each category will be initialized to a random vector with a fixed length of M ( M = 50 ) before the training of the neural network models . Thus , we can get an embedding matrix . 3 . Using the skip - gram and negative sampling strategies , we train the neural network model , predict the surrounding categories , compare the predicted categories with actual categories to compute the loss , and update the model parameters based on the loss and automatic differentiation . 15 4 . After training the neural network model , we get the updated word embedding matrix . Figure 1 . The 2 - dimensional Knowledge Space of PACS codes Using word embedding models , we can locate the position of each PACS code within the 50 - dimensional knowledge space . To visualize the high - dimensional knowledge space as a two - dimensional picture , we employ the t - distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t - SNE ) algorithm to reduce the dimension of each PACS code’s vector from 50 to 2 ( Maaten & Hinton , 2008 ) . Figure 1 visualizes the 2 - dimensional knowledge space of PACS codes after dimension reduction . Each point represents a PACS code , and the color of the points represents which category it belongs to . As shown in Figure 1 , the distribution of the PACS codes of interdisciplinary physics and related areas is relatively scattered . The scattered distribution of the PACS codes regarding interdisciplinary research is self - evident : interdisciplinary means entering different disciplines . In addition , most PACS codes belonging to one category are perfectly grouped . Figure 1 suggests that the knowledge space generated with word embedding models can effectively capture the relative position of different PACS codes . 16 We further measure internal knowledge spanning ( article distance and network distance ) and external knowledge spanning ( journal distance ) based on the results of word embedding models and network analysis ( see Figure 2 ) . First , as illustrated above , we can use word embedding models to represent the positions of articles , categories , and journals . We define the cosine distance of two given vectors as 1 - Cosine Similarity of these two vectors . Thus , we can measure the scope covered by the categories of an article ( article distance ) and its distance to the journal in which it is published ( journal distance ) . Second , the PACS codes have a tree - like network structure featured by distinct hierarchies . Thus , we can represent it as a knowledge tree and measure the network distance covered by a given set of PACS codes . Figure 2 . Quantifying Knowledge Spanning with Knowledge Space and Knowledge Tree The tradition is constantly changing and continually reproduced by scientists’ strategic choices about what to study and cite ( Bourdieu , 1975 ) . Figure 3 visualizes the evolution of APS journals in the knowledge space from 1985 to 2015 . Different colors denote different journals . The arrow indicates the chronological order from 1985 to 2015 . The broken line 17 shows the positions of the journal over time . To better visualize the direction of the evolution , we smooth the trajectories and plot the smoothed lines . Surprisingly , there seems to be a direction for the evolution of the APS journals . Although the direction of scientific development is brought by the paradigm established by prior scientific revolution or innovation , it is primarily maintained by tradition . Figure 3 . The Evolution of APS Journals in the 2 - dimensional Knowledge Space Over Time Journal Distance . In this study , we use the journal distance from paper 𝑖 to journal 𝑗 to measure the paper 𝑖 ’s external knowledge spanning . Journal distance measures the cosine distance between the focal paper vector and its journal vector in its publication year ( M = 0 . 24 , SD = 0 . 11 ) . Thus , to calculate journal distance , we need to measure the position of paper 𝑖 and journal 𝑗 in year 𝑦 , and y is the year when paper 𝑖 is published in journal 𝑗 . 18 First , we can get the category vectors 𝑣 𝑐 for each PACS code using word embedding models . Suppose that the paper 𝑖 has 𝑚 PACS codes . Then , its paper vector 𝑣 𝑖 can be measured by the mean value of its PACS codes’ category vectors 𝑣 𝑝 , 𝑖 , 𝑝 ∈ ( 1 , 𝑚 ) : 𝑣 𝑖 = 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑣 𝑝 , 𝑖 . ( 1 ) Second , for a given journal 𝑗 , suppose that the number of papers published by journal 𝑗 in the year 𝑦 is 𝑛 . We identify all these papers and denote their paper vectors as 𝑣 𝑘 , 𝑗 , 𝑘 ∈ ( 1 , 𝑛 ) . Then , we can calculate the journal vector 𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑦 of the journal 𝑗 in the publication year 𝑦 as the mean value of 𝑣 𝑘 , 𝑗 : 𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑦 = 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑣 𝑘 , 𝑗 . ( 2 ) The journal distance from the paper 𝑖 to journal 𝑗 can be measured as the cosine distance between 𝑣 𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑦 : 𝐽𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) = 1 − 𝑣 𝑖 ⋅ 𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑦 | 𝑣 𝑖 | | 𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑦 | . ( 3 ) Article Distance . Article distance measures the breadth covered by the categories of scientific research in the knowledge space ( M = 0 . 23 , SD = 0 . 14 ) . Given paper 𝑖 has 𝑚 PACS codes , then there are 𝑚 ( 𝑚−1 ) 2 pairs of categories in paper 𝑖 . A pair of category vectors of paper 𝑖 can be denoted as 𝑣 𝑝 , 𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑞 , 𝑖 , where 𝑝 & 𝑞 ∈ ( 1 , 𝑚 ) and 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞 . Then , the article distance can be calculated as follows : 𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) = 2 𝑚 ( 𝑚−1 ) ∑ ( 1 − 𝑣 𝑝 , 𝑖 ⋅ 𝑣 𝑞 , 𝑖 | 𝑣 𝑝 , 𝑖 | | 𝑣 𝑞 , 𝑖 | ) . ( 4 ) Network Distance . Network distance measures the length covered by the categories of scientific research on the knowledge tree ( M = 6 . 96 , SD = 2 . 83 ) . As shown in Figure 2 , we can also measure the internal knowledge spanning with network analysis . Given paper 𝑖 and its 𝑚 PACS codes , we can denote one of its 𝑚 ( 𝑚−1 ) 2 pairs of categories as 𝑝 and 𝑞 , where 𝑝 & 𝑞 ∈ ( 1 , 𝑚 ) and 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞 . Based on the network structure of the knowledge tree , we can calculate the 19 shorted path length 𝐿 ( 𝑝 , 𝑞 ) and the network distance of paper 𝑖 can be calculated using the following formula : 𝑁𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) = 2 𝑚 ( 𝑚−1 ) ∑ 𝐿 ( 𝑝 , 𝑞 ) . ( 5 ) Note that the PACS code is a 6 - digital number , and by adding a root node to represent physics , the tree network of PACS codes represents the hierarchical relationship of six levels . Level 1 represents the root node , that is Physics ; Level 2 represents the ten disciplines of Physics ( see Figure 1 ) ; Level 3 represents the subdisciplines of Physics , and so on . If two categories on level 6 are distributed on two branches growing from the same node on level 3 , the network distance between them would be 6 . Moreover , if two categories on level 6 are distributed on two branches growing from the same node on level 2 , the network distance between them would be 8 . The mean value of 6 . 96 suggests that most categories are located on level 3 or 2 . Most scientific research of APS is distributed within a subdiscipline or discipline of Physics . In other words , interdisciplinary spanning is relatively rare . Moderating Variables Team Size . Team size is the number of scholars who co - published given research ( M = 3 . 67 , SD = 2 . 82 ) . In our analysis , the largest team size is 25 , and the median is 3 . Dependent Variables Citation Counts . Citation counts are the number of papers that cite the focal paper . Since the distribution of citation counts is highly skewed , we transform it with its logarithmic form ( M = 1 . 99 , SD = 1 . 17 ) Disruption Percentile . Following the tradition of prior research ( Funk & Owen - Smith , 2017 ; Wu et al . , 2019 ) , we calculate the 𝐷 - score of disruption for each research in the APS dataset : 20 𝐷 = 𝑛 𝑖 −𝑛 𝑗 𝑛 𝑖 + 𝑛 𝑗 + 𝑛 𝑘 , ( 6 ) where 𝑛 𝑖 is the number of subsequent papers that cites the focal paper , 𝑛 𝑗 is the number of subsequent papers that cite both the focal paper and its references , and 𝑛 𝑘 is the number of subsequent papers that only cites the focal paper’s references . There exist some variations of the above formula ( 6 ) . However , according to prior research ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) , there is no essential difference between them . Because the distribution of disruption 𝐷 is also highly skewed , we convert it to its percentile score . Thus , in our analysis , we use the disruption percentile ( M = 48 . 02 , SD = 28 . 15 ) to measure the disruptiveness of scientific research . It is also necessary to note that the measure of disruption 𝐷 tends to be underestimated in the first few years ( Lin et al . , 2022 ) . Findings The key puzzlement of this research focuses on the essential tension between tradition and innovation . We report the correlation matrix of the key variables in Table 1 . First , internal knowledge spanning ( article distance and network distance ) has a weak negative correlation with external knowledge spanning ( journal distance ) . Thus , covering a large area in the knowledge space does not mean deviating from mainstream research . Second , the two measurements of internal knowledge spanning ( article distance and network distance ) have a strong correlation ( r ( 441250 ) = . 82 , p < . 001 ) , which suggests that the measurement of internal knowledge spanning has good convergent validity . Third , team size positively correlates with internal knowledge spanning and negatively correlates with external knowledge spanning . Fourth , team size has a positive correlation with citation counts and a negative correlation with disruption percentile . Fifth , citation counts have a negative correlation with disruption percentile ( r ( 441250 ) = - . 32 , p < . 001 ) . 21 Table 1 .

The first hypothesis H1 asserts that knowledge spanning has an inverted U - shaped impact on citation counts . Three measurements of knowledge spanning have a significant nonlinear influence on citation counts . To further examine the shape of nonlinear influence , we plot the nonlinear influence of knowledge spanning . As shown in Figure 4 , article distance has an inverted U - shaped influence on citation counts . In comparison , network distance has a positive impact on citation counts , while journal distance has a largely negative impact on citation counts . Thus , H1 is partially supported . 22 Figure 4 . The Inverted U - Shaped Influence of Knowledge Spanning on Citation Counts In addition , H2a and H3a focus on the impact of team size on citation counts . As Table 2 shows , team size has a positive main effect on citation counts . Thus , H2a is supported . Further , there are significant interactions between team size and knowledge spanning , especially when we include three measurements of knowledge spanning in model 4 . We plot the moderation effect to further visually show how team size moderates the effect of knowledge spanning . First , as Figure 5 shows , team size can amplify the effect of internal knowledge spanning ( network distance and article distance ) . However , the moderation direction of external knowledge spanning depends on the value of journal distance . When journal distance is smaller than 0 . 5 , team size can amplify the effect of external knowledge spanning ; Or else , team size inhibits or reduces the effect of external knowledge spanning . Second , we can also interpret the moderation of team size in terms of the inverted U - shaped curve . Specifically , team size can strengthen the inverted U - shaped relationship between citation counts and network or journal distance . In contrast , team size would flatten the inverted U - shaped relationship between citation counts and article distance . Thus , H3a is also supported by the findings . 23 Table 2 .

The Moderation Effect of Team Size To test the research hypotheses related to disruptive innovation , we also construct multiple linear regression models ( see Table 3 ) . First , according to Model 5 - 8 , the moderation effect of team size is insignificant . Second , team size consistently has a negative impact on the disruption percentile . Therefore , H2b is well supported while H3b is rejected . Finally , our operational research question Q1 concerns the relationship between knowledge spanning and disruptive innovation . As shown in Table 3 , The square terms of knowledge spanning are generally significant , especially in Model 8 . We visually show the relationship between knowledge spanning and disruption percentile in Figure 6 . Surprisingly , there exists a U - shaped influence of knowledge spanning across three measurements . We have further discussed the implications of these findings in the discussion section .

Our findings suggest that the essential tension holds when we evaluate scientific research by citation counts . Specifically , there is an inverted U - shaped relationship between knowledge spanning and citation counts . Interestingly , network distance has a positive impact on citation counts . In contrast , journal distance has a negative 26 impact on citation counts , especially when the team size is small ( see Figure 4 and Figure 5 ) . However , when we evaluate scientific research by disruptive innovation , both lower and higher levels of knowledge spanning can breed disruptive innovation . In contrast , middle - ranged knowledge spanning hinders disruptive innovation . In this sense , the essential tension seems to disappear . Further , our findings on the role of team size reveal that smaller teams have fewer citation counts but more disruptive innovation than larger teams ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , team size moderates the inverted U - shaped relationship between knowledge spanning and citation counts . Why does network distance fail to capture knowledge spanning’s negative impacts on citation counts ? On the one hand , interdisciplinary spanning within Physics is relatively rare . As we have analyzed in the method section , the mean value of network distance ( M = 6 . 96 ) suggests that most research is located within a subdiscipline or discipline of Physics . On the other hand , the tree network of categories represents the hierarchical relationship between different categories , but its capacity of representation seems to be relatively limited . In contrast , the article distanced measured with the geometric approach perfectly captures the inverted U - shaped relationship between knowledge spanning and citation counts . Our findings largely support Kuhn ' s insight when we evaluate the benefits of knowledge spanning with the currency of scientific credit—citation counts ( Kuhn , 1977 ) . According to the idea of the essential tension proposed by Thomas Kuhn ( 1977 ) , to maximize benefits , scientists need to balance tradition and innovation by choosing the optimal level of knowledge spanning . Guan , Yan , and Zhang ( 2017 ) find that knowledge elements’ average centrality ( i . e . , the element’s combinatorial opportunities with other elements ) in the knowledge network has inverted U - shaped effects on papers’ citation counts . Foster and his colleagues ( 2015 ) have also examined the essential tension by analyzing the inverted U - shaped relationship between five research strategies ( jump , new bridge , repeat bridge , new 27 consolidation , and repeat consolidation ) on citation counts . In particular , pure innovation is highly penalized by the research attention in the form of citation counts , while modest fractions of innovation are highly rewarded . In addition , our findings further show that the punishment for external knowledge spanning ( i . e . , journal distance ) is much more severe than internal knowledge spanning ( e . g . , article distance , see Figure 4 ) . In line with Foster et al . ( 2015 ) , these findings show that the essential tension has a strategic origin in maximizing citation counts , accumulating scientific capital , and occupying a higher position in the scientific field ( Bourdieu , 1975 ) . Interestingly , Chen , Arsenault , and Larivière ( 2015 ) argue that the top 1 % most cited papers exhibit higher levels of interdisciplinarity . Similarly , Chen et al . ( 2021 ) find that highly cited papers always exhibit greater variety . One reasonable explanation is that the highly cited papers are featured by a middle - level of knowledge spanning . Compared to highly cited papers , much more scientific research is featured by higher level of knowledge spanning and lower citation counts . Surprisingly , the essential tension tends to disappear when we use disruptive innovation as an alternative indicator to evaluate science . Kuhn ' s assertion of the essential tension argues that both tradition and innovation are indispensable ( Kuhn , 1977 ) . Confusingly , he opposes tradition and innovation , especially in the phase of normal science . In the seminal work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , Kuhn ( 1962 ) largely denies the role of innovation in normal science . Instead , Kuhn ( 1962 ) views innovation as the unintended outcome of professionalization . Consequently , scientists are generally disciplined by the professionalization logic in the scientific field organized with citation counts . Against this backdrop , we discover that both lower and higher levels of knowledge spanning can breed disruptive innovation . This discovery reminds us to reconsider the interpretation of the essential tension in terms of disruptive innovation . When evaluating science with disruptive innovation , the relationship between tradition and innovation is not an optimization problem 28 with only one answer . In contrast , middle - ranged knowledge spanning turns out to be harmful to disruptive innovation . Thus , tradition or the dominant paradigm does play a critical role in developing normal science . But Kuhn ' s narrative about tradition and innovation in normal science could be only partially correct . Our findings highlight the role of the higher - level knowledge spanning in scientific research . This study has important policy implications . First , using disruptiveness as another currency of scientific credit can better relieve the tension between tradition and innovation . If we evaluate scientific research with citation counts , keeping an optimal distance from the crowd , assembling a larger team , and chasing the hot spots of scientific research would be highly rewarded . On the contrary , if we evaluate the impact with disruptive innovation , scientists can stay either closer to or farther from the crowd in order to achieve more disruptive innovation . Second , we do not advocate using disruptive innovation to replace citation counts . It usually takes a longer time for disruptive research to be recognized and obscure the light of prior research . We acknowledge the limitations of this study which shed light on future research . First , we quantify knowledge spanning by the PACS code of APS papers . However , APS has stopped using the PACS code , and most other journals generally use the keywords given by the submission system or researchers themselves . Second , similar to the seminal work of Thomas Kuhn ( 1962 , 1977 ) , our study also primarily focuses on the knowledge spanning in the discipline of Physics . In summary , whether this research approach can be generalized to other situations or disciplines deserves more attention in future research . This study concludes that the essential tension between tradition and innovation would disappear if we change the currency of scientific credit from citation counts to disruptive innovation . From the perspective of disruptive innovation , both lower and higher levels of knowledge spanning can disrupt science . In this sense , there is a binary choice between 29 tradition and innovation . Scientists need to make their choice when they start their scientific research . Although the strategic choice of the optimal level of knowledge spanning can increase the citation counts , it will constrain the capacity of disruptive innovation . In all , disruptive innovation deserves to become another currency of scientific credit . References American Physical Society . ( 2021 ) . APS Data Sets for Research .
