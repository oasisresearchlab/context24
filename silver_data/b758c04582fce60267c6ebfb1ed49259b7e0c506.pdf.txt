894894 From Willingness to Intention : Experience Moderates the Shift From Reactive to Reasoned Behavior Elizabeth A . Pomery Frederick X . Gibbons Iowa State University Monica Reis - Bergan James Madison University Meg Gerrard Iowa State University to act or not act—a behavioral intention—is made . Prime examples of this type of expectancy - value per - spective are the theory of reasoned action ( Fishbein & Ajzen , 1975 ) and its update , the theory of planned behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 ) . These models have proved to be very effective at predicting a number of more rational and / or reasoned behaviors ( e . g . , voting , donating blood ; for reviews see Ajzen & Fishbein , 2005 ; Armitage & Conner , 2001 ) . Intention  Behavior Intentions are assumed to reflect the motivational factors that underlie actions ; in other words , how much effort an individual is planning to exert to perform a specific behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 ) . Behavioral intention ( BI ) plays a central role in the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior , as it is the only proximal Authors’ Note : Elizabeth A .

Three studies compared the predictive validity of three proximal antecedents to risk behavior : behavioral inten - tion ( BI ) , behavioral expectation ( BE ) , and behavioral willingness ( BW ) . In Study 1 , BW was the only signifi - cant predictor of change in substance use in early ado - lescence ( age 13 ) , whereas only BI was significant in middle adolescence ( age 16 ) . In Study 2 , BW was a bet - ter predictor of change in smoking among young ado - lescents than was BE , but BE became predominant by middle adolescence . By late adolescence , previous behavior surpassed both BE and BW . When only smok - ing initiation was examined , BW was a better predictor than was BE . In Study 3 , BI , BW , and BE independently predicted class skipping . However , BI was a better pre - dictor for students more experienced with the behavior , whereas BW was superior for less experienced students . The findings provide evidence of a developmental shift from more reactive to more reasoned processing , as experience with the behavior increases . Keywords : reasoned vs . reactive processing ; behavioral inten - tion ; behavioral willingness ; behavioral expectations M ost models of social behavior assume that the decision to engage in a particular behavior is the result of a deliberative , goal - oriented process that fol - lows a logical sequence ( Ajzen , 1985 ; Rogers , 1983 ) .

It has done well in this regard : Meta - analyses have consistently found high correlations between intentions and behav - ior ( e . g . , r + = . 47 ; Armitage & Conner , 2001 ) . Recent evidence , however , has suggested that intentions may not play as large a role in predicting behavior as previously thought . In a meta - analysis of experiments ( interventions ) that attempted to change intentions and measured changes in behavior , Webb and Sheeran ( 2006 ) found medium to large effects for predicting changes in intentions ( d = . 66 ) but only small to medium effects for change in intentions predicting changes in behavior ( d = . 36 ) . In addition , the effect of intervention on behavior was not fully medi - ated by changes in intention , suggesting that additional factors need to be taken into account . In particular , Webb and Sheeran suggested future behavioral change research should investigate non reasoned processes , as outlined in the prototype / willingness model ( PWM ; described later ) . One suggestion for improving the predictive strength of BI has been to use measures of behavioral expectation as a supplement to , or substitute for , BI ( see Table 1 ) . Behavioral expectation ( BE ) is defined as an “indi - vidual’s estimation of the likelihood that he or she will perform some specified future behavior” ( Warshaw & Davis , 1985 , p . 215 ) . BI and BE are similar cognitively in that they both reflect some premeditation about the behavior and its consequences . And , in fact , they are often used interchangeably ( see Armitage & Conner , 2001 ) . What distinguishes the two is that BE involves an additional appraisal of the personal and situational factors that may be influential . For certain behaviors , then , BE may be a better predictor than BI ( Gibbons & Gerrard , 1997 ; Parker , Manstead , Stradling , & Reason , 1992 ) . In particular , a person may recognize that a behavior is inappropriate ( e . g . , drunk driving ) and have no plans to engage in the behavior but none - theless realize that it is likely that he or she will do it some time in the future . This is especially true among individuals with some previous experience with the behavior . The PWM Not all behaviors are planned or goal based , however . Gibbons and Gerrard developed the PWM to help under - stand and predict the occurrence of behaviors that could be considered neither reasoned nor rational ( Gerrard et al . , 2002 ; Gibbons , Gerrard , & Lane , 2003 ; Gibbons , Gerrard , Reimer , & Pomery , 2006 ) . In particular , the model was designed to examine risky behavior ( e . g . , drug use , unpro - tected sex ) among adolescents and young adults . It is based on three related assumptions that emphasize the social nature of these behaviors : ( a ) Although many risk behav - iors are volitional , they are neither reasoned nor inten - tional ; instead , they are reactions to circumstances that are risk conducive . ( b ) For young people , most health risk behaviors are social events ( Nadler & Fisher , 1992 ) that have identifiable social images associated with them . ( c ) When an opportunity to engage in a risky behavior is available , this social image is influential in the adolescents’ decision . Risk Prototypes The first focal construct of the PWM is prototypes or images . Numerous studies have demonstrated that people—especially young people—have distinct images of the type of person who engages in risk behaviors ( Burton , Sussman , Hansen , Johnson , & Flay , 1989 ; Chassin , Tetzloff , & Hershey , 1985 ) . According to the PWM , people realize that if they perform a behavior publicly , they are likely to be identified as members of the group that the image represents ( e . g . , the “typical smoker” ) . In this sense , the images are social consequences of the behavior—engage in the behavior and acquire the image . Thus , the less acceptable the image is perceived to be , the less willing the individual is to engage in the behavior . Willingness The second focal construct in the PWM is behavioral willingness ( BW ) . Briefly , BW reflects an individual’s TABLE 1 : Description of Intentions , Expectations , and Willingness Constructs Construct Behavioral intentions ( BI ) Behavioral expectations ( BE ) Behavioral willingness ( BW ) Definition Plans or intentions of engaging in a behavior ; considered a goal state Prediction of one’s future behavior Willingness to engage in a risky behavior given a risk - conducive environment Typical Measure In ( time frame ) , do you intend to do ( behavior ) ?

Relative to BI and BE , BW involves little precontemplation of the behavior or its consequences ( Gerrard et al . , 2002 ; Gerrard et al . , 2009 ; Gibbons , Gerrard , Ouellette , & Burzette , 1998 ) . Nonetheless , it is assumed that even young people have an idea of how they might react in risky situations , even though they have no intention or even expectation of being in those situations ( Gibbons et al . , 2006 ) . Some researchers consider BW and BE to be alternate forms of BI ( Ajzen & Fishbein , 2005 ; Fishbein , 2008 ) . In fact , the three constructs are clearly similar ( see Table 1 ) and tend to be highly correlated ; however , evidence is accu - mulating that they are independent predictors of behav - ior . Specifically , BW adds to the predictive validity of BI or BE for certain kinds of behavior ( risky sex , drinking and driving ) , especially among adolescents ( Gerrard et al . , 2006 ; Gibbons et al . , 2004 ; Spijkerman , van den Eijnden , & Engels , 2005 ; Thornton , Gibbons , & Gerrard , 2002 ; van Empelen & Kok , 2006 ) . . Age and Experience as Moderators The decision - making process is different for adults— who are likely to have much more experience with risk behavior and risk - conducive situations than are adoles - cents . In fact , there is some indirect support in the expected utility literature for the idea that age influences the relation between BI and behavior ( e . g . , Kashima , Gallois , & McCamish , 1993 ) . In their meta - analysis of the intention – condom use relation , Sheeran and Orbell ( 1998 ) found that the effect size for adolescents was significantly smaller than that for older samples ( r s = . 25 vs . . 50 ) . They suggested this is a reflection of differences in experience with situations in which condom use deci - sions are made rather than age per se . Beck and Ajzen ( 1991 ) reported similar reasoning in their discussion of why the theory of planned behavior was less effective in explaining performance of dishonest activities ( e . g . , shoplifting , lying ) . They concluded that “lack of experi - ence and lack of insight into one’s own motivations and capabilities may result in reports or beliefs , attitudes , and intentions that are not sufficiently reflective of a person’s true dispositions to permit accurate prediction of later behavior” ( p . 299 ) . Those with less experience are less likely to anticipate potential problems . This is one reason their behavior is likely to be more reactive than planned . As people gain experience with a behavior or behavioral situation , however , they become increasingly aware of the circum - stances that typically precede the behavior . With this experience comes an increased awareness of what is likely to happen in the future ( BE ) , as well as increased contemplation of the behavior and its consequences— characteristics of BI . Although BW does not decline in magnitude as experience increases , its predictive power— relative to BI and BE—should decrease . Increasing evidence from brain and behavioral sci - ences suggests that age , which of course is usually cor - related with experience , also plays a role in risky decision making ( Sternberg , 2007 ) . Specifically , adoles - cents are posited to engage in more risky behavior because of the way in which brain networks mature . Whereas the system that is involved in planning , think - ing , and self - regulation ( the cognitive - control network ) tends to mature gradually over the course of adoles - cence ( e . g . , Anderson , Anderson , Northam , Jacobs , & Catroppa , 2001 ) , the system that relates to processing of rewards and is sensitive to social and emotional stimuli ( the socioemotional network ) is influenced by hormonal changes during puberty ( e . g . , Galvan et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , younger adolescents are more likely to rely on the socioemotional network in certain situations ( e . g . , in the presence of peers ) . These lines of research also suggest that BW will be more effective than BI at predicting risky behaviors during early adolescence . Current Studies The current studies examined the hypothesis that age and experience distinguish reactive responding from reasoned responding ( cf . Gibbons & Gerrard , 1997 ) . More specifically , young people , who have had little experience with a risk behavior or behavioral opportu - nity , are not likely to plan ( intend ) , or even expect to engage in that behavior . However , they may have an idea about how they might respond if the ( risk ) opportu - nity presented itself . Their willingness to perform the behavior , therefore , should be a better predictor of future behavior than either their BI ( examined in Study 1 ) or BE ( Study 2 ) . With age and experience , the behavior no longer reflects just a reaction to opportunity ( BW ) . Instead , individuals become more likely to create or anticipate situations rather than simply respond to them and so behavior becomes more deliberate ( premedi - tated ) . Thus , BI and BE will eventually surpass BW in predictive validity . This developmental hypothesis is at the core of the PWM ; it has yet to be tested empirically , however . Finally , Study 3 directly examined the hypoth - esis that experience moderates the relations between behavior and all three proximal antecedents . STUDY 1 Using data from a longitudinal study of African American families , adolescents’ substance use behavior at OAKLAND UNIV on June 8 , 2015 psp . sagepub . com Downloaded from Pomery et al . / SHIFT FROM REACTIVE TO REASONED BEHAVIOR 897 was regressed on their previous behavior , BI , and BW . It was expected that BW would be a superior predictor of behavior change when the adolescents were younger ( ages 12 - 13 ) , whereas BI would be a stronger predictor when the adolescents were older ( ages 15 - 16 ) . Method Participants and Procedure Participants were members of the Family and Community Health Study ( FACHS ) . FACHS is a pro - spective study of psychosocial factors affecting the physical and mental health of African American fami - lies living in nonurban areas—rural farm communities , suburbs , and small metropolitan areas—in Iowa and Georgia . A total of 897 families with a 10 - to 12 - year - old target child were recruited for participation in FACHS at the first wave ( T1 ) . T2 occurred 2 years after T1 , and T3 occurred 3 years after T2 . Details on recruit - ment and retention are available elsewhere ( Cutrona , Russell , Hessling , Brown , & Murry , 2000 ; Simons et al . , 2002 ) . Data were collected by African American inter - viewers who resided in the participants’ communities and had extensive training in the administration of the instruments . Each session included a computer - assisted personal interview ( CAPI ) . Sample sizes were 707 for the T2 / T3 analyses and 639 for the T3 / T4 analyses ; mean ages were T2 = 12 . 3 , T3 = 15 . 5 , and T4 = 18 . 7 . The current analyses are based on data from T2 to T4 because there was very little use ( or BW or BE ) at T1 . Measures Behavior . Substance use at each wave was computed by summing responses from seven items : three for alcohol use ( drink and drink a lot in the last year , and lifetime use ) and two each for marijuana and cigarette use ( past year and lifetime use ) , each coded 0 = no use and 1 = use ; thus , indices ranged from 0 to 7 ( α s for each wave > . 81 ) . BI . BI indices at T2 and T3 were created by averaging responses to three items : “Do you plan to smoke ciga - rettes in the next year ? ” ( 1 = do not plan to , 2 = probably won’t , 3 = probably will , 4 = do plan to ) , “How much alcohol do you plan to drink in the next year ? ” ( 1 = none , 2 = a little , 3 = 3 or more drinks at one time ) , and “Do you plan to use drugs in the next year ? ” ( 1 = do not plan to , 2 = probably won’t , 3 = don’t know , 4 = probably will , 5 = do plan to ) . All scales were recoded to 3 points ( 1 = none , 3 = high ; α s = . 60 for T2 and . 55 for T3 ) . BW . Research based on the PWM has typically meas - ured BW by asking participants to imagine themselves in different hypothetical situations that are risk conducive and then indicate what they would be willing to do under those circumstances . The BW index at each wave was created by averaging responses to six questions based on three different scenarios ( drinking , smoking , and marijuana use ; α s = . 82 for both T2 and T3 ) . For example , the smoking scenario was : Suppose you were with a group of friends and some of them were smoking . There are some extra cigarettes there that you could have if you wanted . How willing would you be to take one and smoke it . . . smoke more than one cigarette ? Each item was measured using 3 - point scales ( 1 = not at all willing , 2 = kind of willing , 3 = very willing ) . Results Descriptive Statistics At T3 , 45 % of the sample reported any substance use ( M = 1 . 26 , SD = 1 . 82 ) ; by T4 , 64 % reported some use . On average , adolescents ( who were using ) reported hav - ing used two of the seven substances . At T2 , intention and willingness to use were both low ( M s = 1 . 08 and 1 . 08 ; SDs = 0 . 23 and 0 . 21 ) ; as expected , both had increased by T3 ( BI : M = 1 . 18 , SD = 0 . 34 ; BW : M = 1 . 19 , SD = 0 . 34 ) . Females reported higher willingness and intentions at T2 ( p s < . 03 ) , but there were no other sig - nificant gender differences . 1 Regression Analyses T3 . Each predictor was significantly correlated with T3 substance use ( r s > . 18 , p s < . 001 ) , and T2 BI and BW were strongly correlated ( r = . 65 , p < . 001 ) .

As expected , BW predicted use at T3 ( β = . 16 , t = 3 . 08 , p < . 002 ) , but intentions to use did not ( β = – . 03 , t = – 0 . 72 , ns ) . T4 . Once again , all ( T3 ) predictors were significantly correlated with ( T4 ) use ( r s > . 29 , p s < . 001 ) ; T3 BI and BW were again correlated ( r = . 72 , p < . 001 ) . When T4 use was regressed on T3 age , use , BI , and BW , past behav - ior was a stronger predictor of use ( β = . 34 , t = 6 . 31 , p < . 001 ; see Table 2 ) . However , as expected , a different pattern emerged with respect to BI and BW : BW was not significantly related to future use ( β = – . 03 , t = – 0 . 53 , ns ) , whereas BI was ( β = . 11 , t = 2 . 06 , p = . 04 ) . Age was no longer significant . Discussion Study 1 demonstrated a change in predictive validity of BW relative to BI across three waves : BW predicted change in use from ages 12 . 3 ( T1 ) to 15 . 5 ( T2 ) , and then BI predicted from age 15 . 5 ( T2 ) to 18 . 7 ( T3 ) . Although only suggestive , these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that substance use was more reactive ( to situ - ational contexts ) in early adolescence and became more planful as participants aged . Substance use becomes more normative the older adolescents get , so the shift ( from BW to BI ) is not unexpected , as their intentions are increasingly based on past behavior—even vicarious behavior ( observing others’ actions ) . Using a longitudi - nal study with more frequent waves of data collection , Study 2 examined smoking behavior over time . STUDY 2A : SMOKING ESCALATION Study 2 examined the relations among BE , BW , and subsequent behavior using a similar longitudinal design . BE measures were included instead of BI . Smoking behavior and cognitions were measured annually over 6 years in a panel of Caucasian adolescents . The first prediction was the same as in Study 1 : In early adoles - cence ( approximately ages 13 - 14 ) , BW would be a more powerful predictor of behavior than BE . Over time , as adolescents become more self - aware and more capable of predicting their behavior ( ages 16 - 17 ) , the predictive power of BW will give way to BE . Second , it was expected that the predictive utility of BE over time would be curvilinear . When smoking habits are develop - ing in middle adolescence , BE will predict behavior . In late adolescence ( approximately ages 18 - 19 ) , however , when these habits are more developed ( Wills , Sandy , & Shinar , 1999 ) , BE should become largely a reflection of past experience and behavior . Thus , it should not pre - dict future behavior net past behavior . Method Participants and Procedure At T1 , the sample comprised 245 male and 255 female adolescents from rural areas in Iowa who had been recruited for a study on psychosocial factors related to health behaviors . The mean age was 14 . 4 ( SD = 1 . 1 yrs . ) . From that group , 476 completed all of the meas - ures at T2 , 456 at T3 , 411 at T4 , 377 at T5 , and 347 at T6 . 2 Most participants were interviewed in their homes ; those not living with their parents received question - naires in the mail ( for a full description of the sample and procedures , see Gerrard , Gibbons , Benthin , & Hessling , 1996 ) . Families received $ 55 for participating . The interval between waves was approximately 1 year . Because our interest was in examining the development of smoking cognitions , adolescents who reported smok - ing everyday at T1 ( n = 6 ) were excluded from the analyses . Sample sizes for each analysis are reported in Table 3 . Measures Behavior . Smoking was assessed at each wave by ask - ing , “How often do you smoke now ? ” followed by a 4 - point scale ( 1 = not at all , 4 = every day ) . BE . BE was measured at T1 - T3 by asking , “Do you think that you will smoke cigarettes in the future ? ” fol - lowed by a 7 - point scale ( 1 = I definitely will not , 7 = I definitely will ) . At T4 , a similar item was used ( “Do you think that you will smoke cigarettes in the next year ? ” ) . At T5 , the BE item was , “How likely is it that you will smoke in the next 12 months ? ” followed by a 7 - point scale ( 1 = not at all likely , 7 = very likely ) . Wording of the items is similar to other BE measures ( Warshaw & Davis , 1985 ) ; that is , as participants aged and smoking became more likely , the BE measure became more specific timewise ( cf . Ajzen & Fishbein , 2005 ) . BW . BW used the following scenario : “Suppose you were with some friends and one of them offered you a cigarette . How willing [ likely ] would you be to take it and try it ? ” This was followed by a 7 - point scale ( 1 = not at all willing [ likely ] , 7 = very willing [ likely ] ) . From T1 to T4 , the BW item used the word likely ; at T5 , willing was used 3 ( α across the five waves = . 84 ) . at OAKLAND UNIV on June 8 , 2015 psp . sagepub . com Downloaded from Pomery et al . / SHIFT FROM REACTIVE TO REASONED BEHAVIOR 899 Results Descriptive Statistics Means , standard deviations , and correlations are presented in Table 4 . Smoking behavior increased over time ( Miller , 2005 ) , as did BE and BW , with BW being consistently higher than BE ( p s < . 001 ) . As in previous studies , the correlations between BW and BE were strong . Likewise , correlations between behavior , both future and current , and BE and BW increased over time . The correlations between future behavior and BE and BW both remained significant when the other construct was partialed out ( see Table 4 ) . Regression Analyses BW . A series of five hierarchical regression analyses were conducted . In each case , behavior was regressed on age , previous behavior , BE , and BW ( see Table 3 and Figure 1 ) . As expected , BW was a significant predictor of change in behavior in early adolescence ( T1 - T3 ; all β s > . 13 , t s > 2 . 20 , p s < . 03 ) , and it was a stronger predictor than BE for the first two regressions . As the adolescents aged , however , the predictive power of BW declined , giving way first to BE and past behavior and then just past behavior . BE . As expected , the predictive utility of BE was cur - vilinear . At T1 , most adolescents had very little past smoking experience , and smoking expectations did not predict change in their behavior ( β = . 07 , t = 1 . 41 , ns ) . However , the level of BE and its predictive power both increased up to T4 / T5 ( T2 / T3 : β = . 11 , t = 1 . 82 , p = . 07 ; T3 / T4 : β = . 21 , t = 3 . 84 , p < . 001 ; T4 / T5 : β = . 20 , t = 2 . 78 , p < . 01 ) . At the final wave ( ages 18 or 19 ) , smoking patterns appeared to be fairly well established and the behavior appeared to be largely controlled by routines or habit ; by then , BE added nothing above past behavior ( cf . Ouellette & Wood , 1998 ) . Logistic regressions . When smoking was coded as dichotomous ( yes – no ) , logistic regressions produced a slightly different pattern of results . BE was significant at the three middle waves ( T2 / T3 to T4 / T5 ; Wald statistics > 5 . 04 , p s < . 03 ) . Unlike the linear regressions , however , BW was a significant ( independent ) predictor at every TABLE 3 : Regressing Smoking Behavior on Previous Behavior , BE , and BW ( Studies 2a and 2b ) Study 2a Study 2b Waves Predictors β t N β t N T1 - T2 441 387 ( Ages 14 - 15 ) Age . 09 * 2 . 21 . 09 † 1 . 87 Previous behavior . 38 * * * 8 . 03 BE . 07 1 . 41 – . 08 – 1 . 36 BW . 18 * * * 3 . 40 . 24 * * * 4 . 28 T2 - T3 434 345 ( Ages 15 - 16 ) Age . 05 1 . 18 . 04 0 . 70 Previous behavior . 31 * * * 6 . 18 BE . 11 + 1 . 82 . 09 1 . 51 BW . 24 * * * 4 . 18 . 14 * 2 . 37 T3 - T4 380 269 ( Ages 16 - 17 ) Age . 04 0 . 90 . 13 * 2 . 16 Previous behavior . 39 * * * 7 . 26 BE . 21 * * * 3 . 84 . 04 0 . 64 BW . 13 * 2 . 20 . 17 * * 2 . 62 T4 - T5 365 216 ( Ages 17 - 18 ) Age – . 05 – 1 . 26 . 02 0 . 35 Previous behavior . 45 * * * 8 . 08 BE . 20 * * 2 . 78 . 39 * * * 5 . 37 BW . 13 † 1 . 93 . 09 1 . 21 T5 - T6 344 184 ( Ages 18 - 19 ) Age – . 07 † – 1 . 83 – . 10 – 1 . 48 Previous behavior . 62 * * * 11 . 91 BE . 08 1 . 05 . 17 * 2 . 15 BW . 10 1 . 38 . 29 * * * 3 . 67 NOTE : Study 2a includes all adolescents ; Study 2b includes only those who were not smoking at the first wave of each regression .

Thus , even in late adolescence , there appears to be a reactive element to smoking for some individuals . Discussion As with Study 1 , these findings offer support for the hypothesis that over time , the primary proximal anteced - ent of behavior shifts from BW to BI / BE . As predicted , in the early waves , BW was a significant predictor of future smoking behavior , reflecting the fact that smoking is a social reaction for many young adolescents ; then , as in Study 1 , it gave way to BE . 4 The curvilinear predictive pattern anticipated for BE was also apparent , as it peaked around age 16 or 17 . At that age , behavior is still partly reactive , but adolescents have more self - awareness , and so BE does predict their actions . Finally , past behavior became a better predictor over time ( Stanton , Barnett , & Silva , 2005 ) . Thus , the predictive power of BE and BW vis - à - vis past behavior decreased over time even though absolute levels of both continued to increase . STUDY 2B : SMOKING INITIATION Because the regressions in Study 2a included previous behavior , they provided a conservative test of the predic - tive power of both proximal antecedents , BW and BE ( Weinstein , 2007 ) . Moreover , because BE is partly a reflection of previous behavior ( Gordon , 1990 ) , it may have had an “advantage” over BW in that for some TABLE 4 : Means , Standard Deviations , and Correlations of Primary Measures for Study 2a Measures Beh ( T ) BE BW M s SD s % Smoked T1 Beh 1 . 05 0 . 25 T1 BE . 49 1 . 54 1 . 08 T1 BW . 51 . 63 1 . 87 1 . 50 T2 Beh . 53 . 38 ( . 16 ) . 43 ( . 26 ) 1 . 14 0 . 54 7 . 9 T2 Beh 1 . 12 0 . 51 T2 BE . 54 1 . 80 1 . 35 T2 BW . 52 . 69 2 . 28 1 . 92 T3 Beh . 49 . 44 ( . 17 ) . 47 ( . 26 ) 1 . 26 0 . 74 13 . 1 T3 Beh 1 . 22 0 . 68 T3 BE . 54 1 . 78 1 . 42 T3 BW . 65 . 67 2 . 40 2 . 03 T4 Beh . 59 . 51 ( . 25 ) . 53 ( . 29 ) 1 . 36 0 . 88 16 . 8 T4 Beh 1 . 35 0 . 86 T4 BE . 74 2 . 38 1 . 99 T4 BW . 68 . 82 2 . 68 2 . 24 T5 Beh . 68 . 64 ( . 31 ) . 60 ( . 18 ) 1 . 47 0 . 98 22 . 5 T5 Beh 1 . 45 1 . 05 T5 BE . 71 2 . 56 2 . 17 T5 BW . 71 . 85 2 . 87 2 . 26 T6 Beh . 75 . 60 ( . 20 ) . 61 ( . 23 ) 1 . 53 1 . 05 23 . 6 NOTE : N s range from 344 ( T5 / T6 ) to 441 ( T1 / T2 ) .

Consequently , additional analyses were conducted predicting smoking initiation at each wave , by including only participants who reported at the first of each pair of waves that they had smoked two or fewer times in their lives . The prediction was that the predictive “superiority” of BW over BE would extend into later waves . By age 18 or 19 , however , adolescents were expected to be relatively accurate in their predic - tions of how likely it was that they would start smoking in the next year ; thus , BE should predict behavior . Methods The methods used in Study 2a are identical to those used in Study 2b . Results Descriptive Statistics The number of adolescents who initiated smoking ranged from 11 to 17 per wave ( hazard rates of 4 % - 6 % ) . Descriptive statistics and correlations for the measures are presented in Table 5 . BW and BE were correlated at each wave ( r s = . 43 - . 52 , p s < . 001 ) but not as strongly as they were in Study 2a . BW was significantly correlated with future behavior ( r s > . 18 , p s < . 001 ) ; when BE was partialed out , four of the five BW – behavior correlations remained significant . BE was not significantly correlated with future behavior at T1 , but it was from then on ( r s > . 10 , p s < . 05 ) . However , partialing out BW resulted in the BE – behavior correlations at T2 / T3 and T3 / T4 becoming nonsignificant . Regression Analyses As can be seen in Table 3 , BW was a significant pre - dictor of behavior at the next wave for four of the five regressions , with β s ranging from . 14 to . 29 ( t s > 2 . 37 , p s < . 02 ; the one exception being the T4 / T5 regression : β = . 09 , t = 1 . 21 , ns ) . BE was a nonsignificant predictor in the first three regressions but became significant at T4 / T5 ( β = . 39 , t = 5 . 37 , p < . 001 ) and remained signifi - cant at T5 / T6 ( β = . 17 , t = 2 . 15 , p = . 03 ) . Once again , logistic regressions revealed a similar pattern of results , with BW being a better predictor than BE of a dichoto - mous smoking variable in four of the five regressions . Discussion For those who had not previously engaged in the behavior , BW was a significant predictor of smoking 1 year later in all but one regression . This finding suggests that BW is an antecedent to risk behaviors for adolescents who are inexperienced with the behavior—regardless of age . Moreover , these studies offer further evidence that BI / BE is not the sole proximal antecedent to behavior for certain populations . As adolescents age , they become more capable of predicting how they will act in certain situations—even if they have not yet engaged in the behavior . Thus , reasoned ( proximal ) antecedents , BI and BE , become more effective in predicting behavior . Both Studies 2a and 2b , therefore , suggest that experience with the behavior is a critical factor in distinguishing the reac - tive antecedent ( BW ) from the more reasoned antecedent ( BE ) . That hypothesis was tested directly in Study 3 . STUDY 3 Study 3 examined the extent to which experience moderates the predictive validity of the three proximal antecedents . This time , the behavior was skipping class in college . Although not related to health , skipping class is clearly a type of risk behavior . Theoretically , then , the process should be similar to that involved with health risk ; that is , it is a risky behavior that is volitional , and it is a behavior for which college students are likely to TABLE 5 : Means , Standard Deviations , and Correlations of Primary Measures for Study 2b % Measure BE BW M s SD s Initiated T1 BE 1 . 35 0 . 85 T1 BW . 43 1 . 54 1 . 03 T2 Beh . 02 ( – . 07 ) . 20 ( . 21 ) 1 . 06 0 . 34 4 . 1 T2 BE 1 . 41 0 . 84 T2 BW . 45 1 . 71 1 . 34 T3 Beh . 15 * * ( . 08 ) . 18 ( . 13 * ) 1 . 09 0 . 45 4 . 9 T3 BE 1 . 29 0 . 82 T3 BW . 43 1 . 57 1 . 14 T4 Beh . 10 * ( . 03 ) . 18 ( . 15 * * ) 1 . 09 0 . 41 5 . 2 T4 BE 1 . 34 0 . 82 T4 BW . 51 1 . 55 1 . 18 T5 Beh . 43 ( . 35 ) . 28 ( . 08 ) 1 . 07 0 . 34 5 . 6 T5 BE 1 . 15 0 . 51 T5 BW . 52 1 . 41 0 . 94 T6 Beh . 33 ( . 16 * ) . 38 ( . 26 ) 1 . 09 0 . 41 6 . 0 NOTE : N s range from 186 ( T5 / T6 ) to 387 ( T1 / T2 ) .

That image should , in turn , influence the behavior . Thus , consistent with the PWM , we hypothesized that : ( a ) BW would be more predictive of skipping than BI for those with less experi - ence with the behavior . ( b ) For this ( less experienced ) group , BW would mediate the relation between image and behavior . ( c ) As experience with the behavior increases , BW should lose predictive power to BI , and the social image should become less of a factor . ( d ) Finally , because BE is similar to BI ( in that it taps into a more reasoned processing style ) , it was hypothesized that BE would also interact with experience : It should be a stronger predictor for high - experience students than for low - experience students . This is the first study to exam - ine the relations among BI , BE , and BW and compare their predictive validity , and it is the first to apply the prototype model to a risk behavior that is not health related . Method Participants and Procedure Participants were 99 male and 155 female under - graduates in an introductory social psychology class who completed a survey on the first day of class and again on the last day . Everyone present on the 1st day ( N = 343 ) completed the survey . Of that group , 261 ( 76 % ) also completed the survey on the last class day ; seven of them were discarded because of missing data . The sample comprised 35 % freshmen , 32 % sopho - mores , 18 % juniors , and 15 % seniors . The research was described as a study of factors that predict class attend - ance ; students received extra credit for participation . Measures Behavior . Students were asked , “How many times did you miss a quiz day for whatever reason when you were not sick ? ” 5 Experience . Past experience was measured by asking students how many prior semesters they had completed at [ university ] . The assumption that students have more experience skipping class the longer they have been in school was tested and supported with a separate sample . 6 BI , BE , and BW . Sixteen unannounced quizzes were given over the course of the semester . Because we believed students would be more likely to remember how many quizzes they had missed rather than how many classes they had missed ( there were 16 quizzes vs . 41 classes ) , quiz attendance was the primary dependent variable and was specifically mentioned in the BI , BE , and BW questions . Again , the wording of the items was consistent with that used in earlier studies . BI included the word plan ( Ajzen , 2002a ) , “Do you plan to miss class ( for whatever reason when you are not sick ) on a day that you think there might be a quiz ? ” followed by a 7 - point scale ( 1 = definitely no , 7 = definitely yes ) . Consistent with Warshaw and Davis ( 1985 ) , BE was assessed by asking , “What is the likelihood that you will miss class on a day you think there might be a quiz for whatever reason when you are not sick ? ” followed by a 7 - point scale ( 1 = not at all likely , 7 = very likely ) . Finally , as in previous PWM studies , BW was measured by having participants think about a particular situation : Suppose something came up immediately prior to class that you wanted or needed to do . If you chose to do this activity you would not be able to go to class . You think there might be a quiz in class today . How willing would you be to do whatever it is you want or need to do and miss class ? This was followed by a 7 - point scale ( 1 = not at all willing , 7 = very willing ) . Prototype . Participants were presented with a descrip - tion of a prototype ( Gibbons & Gerrard , 1995 ) and then asked to indicate their impression of the “type of person who regularly misses class ( not due to illness ) ” using 12 adjectives ( e . g . , smart , confused , popular ; reversed when necessary ; α = . 65 ) . 7 The 12 items were divided into three random parcels and used as indica - tors in a structural equation model ( SEM ) . Results Descriptive Statistics Means , standard deviations , ranges , and correlations for the primary measures are presented in Table 6 . The mean value of BE was higher than that for BI ( cf . Warshaw & Davis , 1985 ) , and as in Study 2 , reports of BW were higher than reports of either BE or BI ( all p s < . 05 ) . Examination of the overall matrix indicates that all three antecedents were correlated with the dependent variable , missed quizzes ; however , BE and BI constructs were more closely related to one another ( r = . 60 , p < . 001 ) than they were to BW ( BE / BW r = . 43 ; BI / BW r = . 33 , p s < . 001 ) , t s ( 251 ) > 3 . 06 , p s < . 003 , whereas BW was more strongly related to BE than it was to BI , differ - ence : t ( 251 ) = 5 . 03 , p < . 001 . Prototype was more highly correlated with BW ( r = . 32 , p < . 001 ) than either BI ( r = . 20 , p = . 002 ) or BE ( r = . 16 , p = . 01 ) . All of these relations are consistent with the PWM . at OAKLAND UNIV on June 8 , 2015 psp . sagepub . com Downloaded from Pomery et al . / SHIFT FROM REACTIVE TO REASONED BEHAVIOR 903 Experience was significantly correlated with BI ( r = . 18 , p = . 004 ) and marginally associated with BW ( r = . 11 , p = . 07 ) ; it was not significantly correlated with BE , prototype , or number of classes missed ( r s < . 06 ) . Regression Analyses Experience . A hierarchical multiple regression analy - sis was conducted to examine the hypothesis that expe - rience moderates the relations between behavior and BI , BE , and BW . The measure of experience was continu - ous , and all measures were standardized . Experience was entered in Step 1 , followed by BW , BE , and BI in Step 2 ; the three predicted moderation interactions including experience and the antecedents were then entered in Step 3 . These analyses ( see Table 7 ) indicated that all three antecedents were significant , independent predictors of subsequent behavior in Step 2 . As might be expected , given the nature of the behavior , BE was the strongest predictor , followed by BW ( both β s > . 20 , t s > 3 . 39 , p s < . 001 ) ; BI was the weakest ( β = . 14 , t = 2 . 16 , p = . 03 ) . Results of Step 3 indicated that two of the three hypothesized interactions were significant : BW × Experience and BI × Experience , and their patterns were as predicted ( see Figure 2 ) . BW demonstrated a stronger relation with behavior for participants with less college experience ( β = . 32 , t = 3 . 90 , p < . 001 ) than for those with more experience ( β = . 11 , t = 1 . 52 , ns ) . Conversely , the pattern of the BI × Experience interaction indicates a strong positive relation between behavior and BI for students with more experience ( β = . 26 , t = 3 . 15 , p = . 002 ) and no relation for students with less experience ( β = – . 07 , t = – 0 . 66 , ns ) . The BE × Experience interaction was not significant ( β = – . 06 , t = – 0 . 82 , ns ; see later ) . 8 Mediation . Because BW was a significant predictor only for those with less experience , analyses examining the hypothesis that BW would mediate the prototype – behavior relation were conducted only on the less expe - rienced participants ( defined as having completed zero or one semester at the university ; N = 114 ) . SEM was used to examine this predicted indirect effect . Prototype was specified as a latent construct ; all indicators had loadings > . 61 .

The model ( using LISREL 8 . 50 ; Jöreskog & Sörbom , 2001 ) fit the data very well , χ 2 ( 5 , N = 113 ) = 3 . 66 , p = . 60 , root mean square error of approximation ( RMSEA ) = . 00 , goodness - of - fit index ( GFI ) = . 99 , comparative fit index ( CFI ) = 1 . 00 ; it explained 22 % of the variance in missed quizzes . As shown in Figure 3 , the path from prototype to BW was significant ( β = . 24 , t = 2 . 26 , p = . 03 ) , as was the path from BW to the number of quizzes missed ( β = . 47 , t = 5 . 59 , p < . 001 ) . The indirect effect of prototype on missed quizzes , through BW , was tested using bias - corrected bootstrapping methods ( Mallinckrodt , Abraham , Wei , & Russell , 2006 ) in Mplus 4 . 0 ( Muthén & Muthén , 1998 - 2006 ) ; the effect was significant ( b = . 34 , z = 2 . 11 , p = . 03 ) . Thus , as hypothesized , BW fully mediated the path from prototype to behavior for indi - viduals who were relatively new to college . When the models were repeated , replacing BW with BI and BE , respectively , there was no significant path from proto - type to either cognition ( β s < . 11 , t s < 1 . 06 , ns ) , and the indirect effects of prototype on behavior , via each cogni - tion , were nonsignificant ( z s < 0 . 70 ) . Discussion The hypothesized interactions between experience and BI and BW emerged ; however , the anticipated BE × Experience interaction was not found . Because the major - ity of the students in the sample ( 98 % ) had completed at least one semester of college , it is not surprising , in ret - rospect , that BE was a significant predictor of class skip - ping for all students . Even with minimal experience , students were capable of making a reasonable prediction of their class attendance . In addition , both high - and low - experience students had equivalent mean values of BE . Nonetheless , results from the correlations and regressions provided evidence for the shift from a reactive behavior , reflecting BW , to a more reasoned , premeditated behavior that was based more on BI . Moreover , for the least experi - enced students , the social image of the typical class “skip - per” was a strong predictor of subsequent attendance , and that relation was mediated by BW , as the PWM would predict . Conversely , for students with more experience , deliberative plans ( BI ) predicted attendance , but BW did not ( net BI and BE ) . Thus , the current results are con - sistent with the hypothesis that experience moderates the relations between behavior and BW and BI . Finally , although previous studies have shown that BW mediates the relation between prototype and behavior ( Gerrard , Gibbons , Stock , Vande Lune , & Cleveland , 2005 ) ; this is the first study to do so with a nonhealth behavior . It is also the first study to show the three cognitions ( BI , BE , BW ) predicting behavior independent of each other . In short , these findings demonstrate that for certain behaviors , it makes sense to look at each of these prox - imal antecedents separately ( Gibbons , 2006 ) . GENERAL DISCUSSION The results of these three studies present a picture of shifting antecedents of behavior as young people mature and accumulate experience . Early on , many adolescents report no intentions to engage in risky behavior—they have not done it in the past and they have no specific plans to do it in the future ( Brooks - Gunn & Furstenberg , 1989 ) . Likewise , their expectations are likely to be low . In this sense , both BI and BE involve some forethought and deliberation . When asked to consider what they might do if given the opportunity , however , many of those who have not thought about it seriously , or avoided thinking about it , will acknowledge at least a possibility of engaging in the behavior ( Gibbons et al . , 2006 ) —and that possibility predicts subsequent behavior . Theoretical Implications : The PWM The current findings provide additional support for the first assumption of the PWM , which is that adolescents’ behavior is often unplanned . The results are also consist - ent with Webb and Sheeran’s ( 2006 ) meta - analysis , which found that change in intentions was related to change in behavior more weakly for behaviors—such as smoking and condom use—that have a clear social component and social image ( i . e . , prototype ) associated with them . These behaviors do not appear to be fully planned or intended . Instead , as suggested by the PWM , these behaviors are often a reaction to the social environment ( Norman & Conner , 2005 ; Reyna & Farley , 2006 ) . For those inexperienced with a behavior , willingness to engage is obviously not based on personal experience . Instead , it is a function of their attitudes , perceived norms , and prototype images . The more favorable their image , the more willing , and eventually the more likely , they are to engage in the behavior .

The ability of proto - types to predict future behavior—net other predictors— actually becomes weaker , however . With experience and maturity comes a growing awareness of what one can and will do , increasing the predictive power of BE and BI relative to BW and prototypes . With BE , more so than BI , these predictions are based increasingly on prior behavior ( Gordon , 1990 ) . Consequently , although the relation between BE and behavior strengthens over time , BE eventually cannot predict future behavior net previous behavior . Age Versus Experience Although age is definitely related to this shift from reactive to reasoned responding ( see Sternberg , 2007 ) , we believe experience often plays a primary role . For example , although it is true that juniors and seniors are , on average , older than freshman , this difference is small compared to the number of college credits that each group has earned ( 15 vs . 85 for this sample ) . The fact that experience increases rapidly and in a more or less consistent manner was a primary reason for choosing class skipping as a way to test our hypotheses . The find - ings of Study 2b also demonstrate the importance of experience , in that for those less experienced with a behavior ( e . g . , nonsmokers ) , BW may be a stronger predictor of behavior than BE , even when they are no longer young adolescents . Nonetheless , experience and age are highly related . The specific age at which the BW  BI / BE shift occurs is likely to be affected by many factors ( including the type of behavior ) . Future research should attempt to tease apart age versus experience because it is likely to have important implications for interventions . BI , BE , and BW Relatively few recent studies have compared inten - tion and expectation measures ( for an exception , see Rhodes & Matheson , 2005 ) . Some have claimed that BI , BE , and BW are all tapping into the same intention construct ( Ajzen & Fishbein , 2005 ; Fishbein , 2008 ) and that , in fact , BI and BE are often used interchangeably in research ( Armitage & Conner , 2001 ) . The current study provides evidence that for certain behaviors and popula - tions , the three measures are not identical—all three can independently predict behavior net the other two . This suggests that they may involve different underlying decision - making processes ( e . g . , planning vs . reacting ; Gibbons , 2006 ) . There are also behaviors that are socially undesirable ( e . g . , lying ) for which it is conceivable that one may intend or plan , and expect , and be willing to do , under certain circumstances . For these behaviors , all three cognitions / antecedents should predict independ - ently and together . These behaviors likely do not repre - sent true “goal states” typical of intentions ( Ajzen , 1996 ) —people realize the behavior is inappropriate or undesirable yet still intend and / or plan on doing it . The Role of Previous Behavior Researchers have consistently found that past behavior is associated with future behavior independ - ent of social cognitive variables ( e . g . , attitudes ; Norman & Conner , 2005 ; for experimental evidence , see Albarracín & Wyer , 2000 ) . Past behavior has informational value , which can influence one’s attitudes , intentions , and expectations ( which then predict behavior ; Ouellette & Wood , 1998 ) . Also , when behavior has become habitual , experience may influence future behavior independent of BI and related cognitions ( as was the case with the last wave of Study 2 ) . Behaviors that have been engaged in over time , and in stable contexts , such as having a ciga - rette after class , come to be routinized and elicited by the context rather than more reasoned factors ( Verplanken & Aarts , 1999 ) . Thus , as is the case with smoking , these behaviors will show strong associations between past and future behavior ( cf . Ouellette & Wood , 1998 ) . For example , a study of Dutch adults ( de Bruijn et al . , 2007 ) found that intention was a significant predictor of later fruit consumption for those with low - or medium - strength habits , but it was not significant for those in the high - habit group . However , others have criticized this habit - based explanation , noting problems of shared method variance ( Ajzen & Fishbein , 2005 ) and circular reasoning ( Ajzen , 2002b ) . Regardless of the debate over whether to include past behavior in social cognitive theories of behavior and the exact mechanism behind this behavioral inertia , past behavior is strongly related to future behavior , especially when those behaviors involve health risk . Thus , the predictive validity of BW and BE is especially noteworthy , as past behavior was controlled in these analyses . Including past behavior in prospective studies investigating the influence of cognitions on behavior tends to underestimate the predictive strength of these cognitions ( Weinstein , 2007 ) . Intervention Implications When the target group has little experience with a risk behavior , attempts to prevent or change that behav - ior should include modifying social images and limiting intentions . Programs that raise awareness that risk behav - iors are often neither intentional nor expected should promote adolescents’ consideration of what they are willing to do , as well as what they intend ( or expect ) to at OAKLAND UNIV on June 8 , 2015 psp . sagepub . com Downloaded from 906 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN do , before entering risk - conducive situations ( Donaldson et al . , 1996 ) . Such deliberation is likely to facilitate the shift from behavior based on situational reactions to behavior based more on reasoned thought ( i . e . , from the social reaction path in the PWM to the reasoned path ; Gibbons et al . , 2003 ) . As experience increases , the emphasis of interventions should shift to more reasoned routes of processing and issues concerning responsibility and ownership of behavior . Thus , the focus of interven - tions should change from the social situation to the individual . In fact , the dual - path assumption of the PWM has been tested in an intervention for adolescent drinking ( Strong African American Families Program ; Brody et al . , 2004 ) . The intervention successfully increased parental monitoring and clear communication of expectations about alcohol use , and these changes inhibited intentions to drink alcohol ( Gerrard et al . , 2006 ) . The intervention also altered adolescents’ images of drinkers , and these changes decreased their willing - ness to drink . Furthermore , these two mediation paths were independently associated with changes in alcohol consumption at a 29 - month follow - up . Limitations Several limitations need to be addressed . One is that the wording of the BE and BW items in Study 2 changed slightly across the multiple waves of measurement . The change in BE ( increased specificity ) reflected maturation of the sample , and the changes in BW paralleled the development of the construct in the PWM . Also , some of the constructs were assessed with single items , which raises issues of reliability . Although these limitations must be considered , two factors mitigate concerns about them . First , is the fact that the pattern of results was consistent with the theoretically derived predictions across the three studies and across multiple waves . Second , there is evi - dence of reliability in the studies : For the adolescent sample in Studies 2a and 2b , it was the high reliability over time ( five waves ) for each of the primary constructs ( e . g . , α s = . 81 for BE and . 84 for BW ) . In Study 3 , it was the high correlations between BE and BI ( r = . 60 ) and between self - reports of quizzes missed ( not due to illness ) and the instructor’s records of missed quizzes ( r = . 90 ) . Moreover , it is unlikely that the general pattern of results in those studies is attributable to low validity or reliabil - ity . Either of these problems would lower all correlations and would not “favor” BW early and then BI / BE later . Nonetheless , future studies of the developmental shift should include more diverse measures of all constructs and investigate different types of behavior . Another potential criticism of the studies is that the measures of cognitions and behavior did not always correspond well . According to the principle of correspondence ( Ajzen & Fishbein , 1977 ) , attitudes will best predict behavior when the measures of each are matched in levels of specificity . The current studies used more general measures of BI , BE , and behavior ( e . g . , smoked over past year ) , whereas the BW measures referred to specific hypothetical situations . However , it is not likely that adolescents found themselves in the specific situations described in the BW scenarios , nor do we try to predict behavior in specific risk - conducive situations . Instead , the goal is to use the BW items to tap into participants’ general level of willingness and , in turn , predict their ( general ) behavior in the future . More important , the BW items did not correspond as well with the behavior measures as did the BI and BE meas - ures , and yet they predicted behavior better for younger and less experienced participants . Thus , in spite of the difference in the level of specificity of the measures , the hypothesized interactions with experience were found . Conclusions These studies provide the first demonstration of the relative influence of experience on BW , BE , and BI , and provide initial evidence of the independent predictive validity of the three cognitions . The PWM , specifically , the antecedents of prototypes and willingness , proved useful in predicting the behavior of individuals with relatively little experience . As experience increased , however , the two antecedents that are based more on deliberation and reasoning—BE and BI—became more influential . In general , the shift from reactive to rea - soned processing that occurs with experience provides additional evidence for the dual - processing contention of the PWM , specifically , the coexistence of a reasoned and a social reaction mode of processing . Thus , the cur - rent studies demonstrate the utility of including behav - ioral willingness , in addition to behavioral intentions and expectations , as cognitive antecedents of certain behaviors , especially among young people with rela - tively little experience with the behavior in question . NOTES 1 . For each study , gender differences were examined and either no gender differences were found , or there was no consistent pattern . Therefore , for simplification , gender was not included in any of the analyses . 2 . Adolescents who were in both the first ( T1 / T2 ) and last ( T5 / T6 ) regressions ( n = 318 ) were compared with those who were only in the first regression ( n = 123 ) on T1 measures . There were no significant differences for any of the measures ; thus , there was no evidence ( in our data ) of differential attrition . 3 . The current version of the prototype / willingness model was being developed during T1 - T4 of this study . The behavioral willing - ness ( BW ) item was reworded slightly to better fit conceptualization of the BW construct . at OAKLAND UNIV on June 8 , 2015 psp . sagepub . com Downloaded from Pomery et al . / SHIFT FROM REACTIVE TO REASONED BEHAVIOR 907 4 . An interesting exception to this pattern can be seen in a study by Fishbein , Cappella , Lerman , and Hennessey ( 2005 ) , who used the same BW measure as that in Study 2a and found that it predicted smoking cessation net behavioral expectation ( BE ) among adult smok - ers . This suggests that adults who are trying to quit a behavior may maintain intentions to do so while acknowledging some BW to con - tinue the behavior . This has important implications for substance interventions that are worthy of future research . 5 . Students were also asked how many quizzes they had missed in the semester . These reports were compared to instructors’ records and yielded a 98 % agreement rate . Because BW , behavioral intention ( BI ) , BE , and prototype referred to missing class not due to illness , however , neither instructor - reported quiz attendance nor self - reported quiz atten - dance ( without the illness qualifier ) could be used in the analyses . 6 . Questionnaires were given to a sample of 194 students ask - ing how long they had been in college and the total number of college classes they had missed when they were not ill . The longer they had been in school , the more classes they reported missing ( r = . 36 , p < . 001 ) . 7 . These adjectives have been used in previous prototype research . The modest alpha reflects the fact that the adjectives were intended for other types of risky behaviors ( e . g . , smoking , risky sex ) . Reliability for the index did not vary as a function of experience . 8 . In additional analyses ( not reported ) , separate regressions were conducted on high - and low - experience students . BE was a sig - nificant predictor for both high and low experience students ( β s > . 32 , p s < . 003 ) , which explains why the hypothesized interaction with experience was not found .
