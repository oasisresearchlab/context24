Introduction Bone marrow ( BM ) has been regarded as a good source of both hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) [ 1 – 5 ] . These stem cells have the capacity for self - renewal and differentiating into cells of multiple lineages . MSCs derived from BM are capable of not only supporting hematopoiesis but also differentiating into mesodermal layer cells such as osteoblasts , chondrocytes , adipocytes , and myoblasts [ 6 – 8 ] . However , the process to collect BM is inva - sive to donors and can cause complications such as infection , bleeding , and chronic pain , thereby limiting a wide application of BM - derived MSCs in tissue engineering and cell therapy . In recent decades , human umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) has been explored as an alternative source to BM for cell Skeletal Myogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Isolated from Human Umbilical Cord Blood Eun Ji Gang , Ju Ah Jeong , Seung Hyun Hong , Soo Han Hwang , Seong Whan Kim , Il Ho Yang , Chiyoung Ahn , Hoon Han , Hoeon Kim Research Institute of Biotechnology , Histostem Co .

Human umbilical cord blood • Mesenchymal stem cells • Immunophenotyping • Myogenic differentiation Abstract Human umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) has been regarded as an alternative source for cell transplantation and cell therapy because of its hematopoietic and nonhematopoi - etic ( mesenchymal ) potential . Although there has been debate about whether mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are invariably present in UCB , several reports showed that MSC - like cells could be consistently derived from human UCB and , moreover , could differentiate into vari - ous cells of a mesodermal origin . However , it remains unclear whether these UCB - derived MSCs are also capa - ble of differentiating into skeletal muscle cells . In this study , we isolated MSCs from human UCB and induced them to differentiate into skeletal muscle cells . During cell culture expansion , UCB - derived mononuclear cells gave rise to adherent layers of fibroblast - like cells expressing MSC - related antigens such as SH2 , SH3 , α - smooth muscle actin , CD13 , CD29 , and CD49e . More important , when these UCB - derived MSCs were incu - bated in promyogenic conditions for up to 6 weeks , they expressed myogenic markers in accordance with myo - genic differentiation pattern . Both flow cytometric and reverse transcriptase – polymerase reaction analyses showed that two early myogenic markers , MyoD and myogenin , were expressed after 3 days of incubation but not after 2 weeks . At week 6 , more than half of UCB - derived MSCs expressed myosin heavy chain , a late myo - genic marker . Our results demonstrate that UCB - derived MSCs possess a potential of skeletal myogenic differenti - ation and also imply that these cells could be a suitable source for skeletal muscle repair and a useful tool of muscle - related tissue engineering .

In con - trast to BM aspiration , human UCB is obtained by a simple , safe , and painless procedure when the baby is delivered . Since the late 1980s , UCB has become an indispensable source of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells for transplan - tation of hematopoietic stem cells to treat some hematologi - cal disorders [ 9 – 14 ] . However , human UCB has been contro - versial for the presence of MSCs ; some researchers successfully isolated MSCs from UCB , whereas others have not [ 15 – 18 ] . Nevertheless , several groups reported that the UCB - derived MSCs could proliferate ex vivo and differenti - ate , at least , into osteoblasts and adipocytes [ 17 – 19 ] . No evi - dence has shown yet that UCB - derived MSCs differentiate into skeletal myoblasts , but they are believed to have such a potential . Myogenic differentiation is regulated by a family of myo - genic regulatory factors ( MRFs ) , including Myf5 , MyoD , myogenin , and MRF4 ; MyoD and Myf5 are required for the determination of skeletal myogenic lineages , whereas myo - genin and MRF4 are thought to regulate cell fusion and termi - nal differentiation [ 20 – 23 ] . In postnatal life , the satellite cells located between muscle fiber sarcolemma and basal lamina are quiescent myoblasts , but they are fully determined to myogenic phenotype so that , once activated , they are capable of terminal differentiation [ 24 – 27 ] . The quiescent satellite cells do not express transcription factors of a MRF family , whereas the activated ones exhibit a battery of molecular markers of Myf5 , MyoD , and , to a lesser extent , myogenin . These satellite cells were once regarded as an ideal source for muscle regeneration and repair , but it turned out that they were few in injured muscle and that they were exhausted immediately during healing processes . A search for an alter - native source with equivalent myogenic potential yielded MSCs not long ago when the BM - derived MSCs were shown to expand in vitro and differentiated successfully into myoblasts [ 8 ] . In this paper , we report that fibroblast - like cells from human UCB , exhibiting mesenchymal phenotypes , are also able to differentiate into cells that express several skeletal muscle – specific genes . Our findings implicate that UCB is a potential source of MSCs for therapy of degenerative muscu - lar diseases or muscle damage / loss from trauma . Materials and Methods Human UCB Harvest and Preparation of MSCs Human UCB samples were harvested from term or preterm deliveries at the time of birth with the mother’s consent . Blood samples were processed within 24 hours of collection . The mononuclear cells were separated from UCB using Ficoll - Paque TM PLUS ( Amersham Biosciences , Uppsala , Sweden , http : / / www . amershambiosciences . com ) and were suspended in culture medium ( low - glucose Dulbecco’s mod - ified Eagle’s medium [ DMEM ; GIBCO , Grand Island , NY , http : / / www . lifetech . com ] containing 15 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 µ g / ml streptomycin , 2 mM L - glutamine , and 1 mM sodium pyruvate ) . The cells were then seeded at a density of 1 ✕ 10 6 cells / cm 2 in culture flasks . After 5 days of culture , suspended cells were removed and adherent cells were additionally cultured . Cultures were maintained at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % carbon dioxide , with a change of culture medium every 5 days . Approximately 50 % – 60 % of confluent cells were detached with 0 . 1 % trypsin – EDTA and replated at a density of 2 ✕ 10 3 / cm 2 in culture flasks . Immunophenotyping of MSCs To detect surface antigens , cells were detached and washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; Jeil Biotechservices Inc ; Daegu , Korea , http : / / www . jbilife . com ) and incubated at 4ºC for 30 minutes with the following cell - specific antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) or phyco - erythrin ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , http : / / www . bdbiosciences . com ) : SH2 ( CD105 , endoglin ) , SH3 ( CD73 ) , CD13 , CD29 ( β 1 integrin ) , CD44 , CD49e ( α 5 integrin ) , CD54 ( ICAM - 1 ) , CD90 ( Thy - 1 ) , CD14 , CD34 , CD45 , CD31 , CD49d ( α 4 integrin ) , CD106 ( VCAM - 1 ) , HLA - ABC , and HLA - DR . For staining with monoclonal mouse anti - human α - smooth muscle actin ( ASMA ; Sigma , St . Louis , http : / / www . sigmaaldrich . com ) antibody , cells were first per - meabilized with cold methanol / PBS for 2 minutes at - 20ºC . After wash with cold PBS , cells were incubated with mouse anti - ASMA antibody at 4ºC for 30 minutes followed by staining with a secondary antibody , anti - mouse - IgG - FITC ( Becton Dickinson ) , for an additional 20 minutes . Labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry ( Beckman Coulter Epics XL ; Miami , http : / / www . beckmancoulter . com ) . Proliferation Studies and Cell - Cycle Analysis For proliferation studies , cells were detached and replated at a density of 1 ✕ 10 4 / ml in culture medium . Viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion . As for cell - cycle analysis , cells were detached and washed with cold PBS and fixed with 70 % ethanol / PBS overnight at 4°C and centrifuged . The pellets were resuspended in 500 µ l PBS in the presence of propidium iodide ( 50 µ g / ml ) and DNase - free RNase A ( 1 mg / ml ) and incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature . Cell - cycle status was determined using fluores - cence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) flow cytometry and ana - 618 Skeletal Myogenesis of Mesenchymal Stem Cells lyzed with MultiCycle software for the proportions of cells in G 1 , S , and G 2 / M phase . FACS Analysis of Skeletal Myogenic Differentiation Skeletal myogenic differentiation was induced by culturing MSCs in myogenic medium ( culture medium supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 0 . 1 µ M dexamethasone , and 50 µ M hydrocortisone ) for up to 6 weeks , as described previously by Zuk and colleagues [ 28 – 30 ] . Myogenic differentiation was analyzed with FACS for MyoD1 , myogenin , and myosin heavy chain ( MyHC ) . For FACS , cells were detached and stained sequentially with primary antibodies ( mouse - anti MyoD and anti - myogenin antibodies ; Becton Dickinson ) and FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies ( FITC - rat anti - mouse IgG1 ; Becton Dickinson ) . Cells were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde until analysis with FACS . For detection of an intracellular protein MyHC , cells were permeabilized with cold methanol / PBS for 2 minutes at - 20ºC before staining with primary mouse anti - myosin ( fast , Sigma ) and FITC - conjugated secondary antibody . Immunocytochemical Staining Cells were plated at a density of 5 ✕ 10 3 / well onto cover slides in six - well plates overnight and induced in myogenic medium for up to 6 weeks . For immunochemical staining , cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde / PBS for 20 minutes at 4ºC . Staining was performed using mouse ABC Staining System ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy ; Santa Cruz , CA , http : / / www . scbt . com ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , cells on slides were incu - bated with mouse - anti MyoD and anti - myogenin antibodies , respectively , overnight at 4ºC after blocking with 1 . 5 % blocking serum in PBS . Slides were washed and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody at 1 µ g / ml for 30 min - utes at room temperature . The secondary antibody was detected by avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase for 30 minutes followed by incubating in peroxidase sub - strate until desired stain intensity developed . The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin ( Sigma ) for 10 seconds and observed under a light microscope . mRNA Detection by Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction To detect mRNA levels of MyoD , myogenin , and myosin , cells were harvested and washed once in PBS . Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Ger - many , http : / / www . qiagen . com ) according to the manufac - turer’s protocol . The first - strand complementary DNA ( cDNA ) was synthesized using RNA polymerase chain reac - tion ( PCR ) kit ( Takara Bio Inc ; Shiga , Japan , http : / / www . takara - bio . co . jp ) . The PCR mixture was amplified using DNA Engine Dyad TM Peltier Thermal Cycler ( MJ Research TM , Inc ; Waltham , MA , http : / / www . mjr . com ) with initial denaturation at 95ºC for 5 minutes , followed by 35 cycles at 95ºC for 1 min - ute , 60ºC for 1 minute , 72ºC for 1 . 5 minutes , and , finally , 72ºC for 7 minutes . The sense and antisense primers used in this study were as follows : MyoD , sense 5 ' - AAG CGC CAT CTC TTG AGG TA - 3 ' and antisense 5 ' - GCG CCT TTA TTT TGA CC - 3 ' ( PCR product , 500 bp ) [ 29 ] ; myogenin , sense 5 ' - TAA GGT GTG TAA GAG GAA GTC G - 3 ' and antisense 5 ' - CCA CAG ACA CAT CTT CCA CTG T - 3 ' ( PCR product , 438 bp ) [ 30 ] ; and myosin heavy chain , sense 5 ' - TGT GAA TGC CAA ATG TGC TT - 3 ' and antisense 5 ' - GTG GAG CTG GGT ATC CTT GA - 3 ' ( PCR product , 750 bp ) [ 31 ] . Identical PCR condi - tions were used to amplify GAPDH cDNA that was used as an internal control ; the sense primer for GAPDH was 5 ' - CCC ATC ACC ATC TTC CAG GA - 3 ' , and the antisense primer was 5 ' - TTG TCA TAC CAG GAA ATG AGC - 3 ' ( PCR prod - uct , 731 bp ) [ 32 ] . The amplified cDNAs ( 10 µ l ) were separated on 1 . 2 % agarose gels , and the bands were visualized by ethid - ium bromide and photographed with Chemi Doc XRS ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , http : / / www . bio - rad . com ) . Immunoblotting Cells cultured for the indicated times were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 400 ml of an ice - cold Tris lysis buffer ( 0 . 01 M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxychloate , and 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ) with added protease inhibitors . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 10 minutes after sonication for 30 seconds . Protein concentration was measured using the BioRad protein assay kit ( BioRad ) after boiling for 5 minutes . Forty micrograms of protein was mixed with ✕ 1 SDS - sample buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 7 , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 50 mM 2 - mercap - toethanol , 0 . 1 % bromophenol blue ) , boiled for 5 minutes , and then subjected to 5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel before being electrotransferred to a Hybond TM - C extra nitrocellu - lose membrane ( Amersham Biosciences ) . The membrane was blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in ✕ 1 TBST ( 10 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) for 1 hour at room tem - perature , and the blots were incubated with mouse anti - MyoD monoclonal antibody , mouse anti - myogenin mono - clonal antibody , mouse anti - skeletal myosin , and mouse anti – α - actin monoclonal antibody . This was followed by incubation with anti - mouse horseradish peroxidase – conju - gated IgG ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Protein visualization was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol .

After 5 days of culture , nonadherent cells were removed by medium change . The adherent cells were small and rounded in shape . These cells grew larger and seemed to be comprised of heterogeneous cells , as judged by their appearance . The elongated cells began to appear among rounded cells between 8 and 15 days of culture , and they con - tinued to grow to become fibroblast - like cells . By two or three passages of culture , the adherent cells became a popu - lation comprised mainly of bipolar fibroblast - like cells and could grow to confluency . We examined the proliferation characteristics of the fibroblast - like cells at the fourth passage . The population - doubling time of cells is approximately 60 hours , as deter - mined by viable counting . FACS analysis showed that 86 % of cells were in the phase of G 0 / G 1 . Immunophenotyping of UCB - Derived Adherent Cells To characterize the adherent cell population derived from UCB , expression of a variety of CD markers and intracellular antigens like ASMA was examined by flow cytometry . Those adherent cells expressed CD13 , CD29 ( β 1 integrin ) , CD44 , CD49e ( α 5 integrin ) , CD54 ( ICAM - 1 ) , CD90 ( Thy - 1 ) , ASMA , CD105 / SH2 / endoglin , and CD73 / SH3 ( Fig . 1 ) . Among these , SH2 and SH3 are well known as MSC - specific antigens . They expressed neither hematopoietic lineage markers such as CD34 nor monocyte - macrophage antigens such as CD14 and CD45 ( Fig . 1 ) . The lack of expression of CD14 , CD34 , and CD45 suggests that cell cultures were depleted of hematopoietic cells during subcultivation . The adherent cells were also negative for expression of CD49d ( α 4 integrin ) , CD106 ( VCAM - 1 ) , and CD31 ( an endothelial - related antigen ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Similar to BM - derived MSCs , the cell population was positive for HLA class I but not for HLA DR ( Fig . 1 ) . All data above indicate that the adherent cells derived from UCB exhibit the phenotype of MSCs . FACS and Reverse Transcription – PCR Analyses of Myogenic Differentiation A potential of UCB - derived MSCs differentiating into osteoblasts , chondrocytes , and adipocytes was demonstrated elsewhere [ 17 – 19 and unpublished data ] . To investigate whether UCB - derived MSCs show a potential to differenti - ate into skeletal muscle cells , MSCs were cultured for up to 6 weeks in myogenic medium containing dexamethasone and hydrocortisone . At different time intervals , treated cells were observed by phase - contrast microscopy and then analyzed by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies against two muscle - specific transcription factors , MyoD and myogenin , as well as a skeletal protein , fast - twitch myosin . At week 1 , MyoD and myogenin were expressed in approximately 8 . 7 % and 90 % of the treated cells , respectively , whereas non - treated cells remained unstained against anti - MyoD and anti - myogennin antibodies ( Fig . 2A ) . However , the expression of MyoD and myogenin quickly vanished from week 2 . This result is consistent with the fact that the two factors are involved in early myogenesis . On the other hand , fast - twitch myosin began to express only after 3 weeks of induction , and approximately 55 . 7 % of treated MSCs at week 6 were visibly stained with monoclonal anti - skeletal myosin antibodies ( Fig . 2B ) . This finding is also not surprising when considering that myosin is an element of skeletal muscle fibers that appears in late myogenesis . Skeletal myoblast differentiation of UCB - derived MSCs was also analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR of MyoD , myogenin , and MyHC . None of these factors were significantly expressed in the cells treated with nonmyogenic medium . In the case of the cells treated with myogenic medium , however , the mRNA levels of both MyoD and myogenin were significantly increased after 3 days ( Fig . 2C ) . At week 1 , the mRNA level of myogenin was highly increased to reach a presumed peak , whereas that of MyoD subsided quickly . The mRNA levels of both factors were almost abolished after 2 weeks ( Fig . 2C ) . The mRNA of MyHC , on the other hand , appeared after 3 weeks of induc - tion , and its expression steadily increased until the sixth week ( Fig . 2C ) . Immunocytochemical Analysis of Myogenic Differentiation To further confirm myogenic differentiation of UCB - derived MSCs , cells were examined immunocytochemically with monoclonal anti - MyoD , anti - myogenin , and anti - skeletal myosin antibodies . Figure 3A shows nuclear staining of MyoD and myogenin in treated cells . Consistent with our previous RT - PCR and FACS results , expression of myogenin was much higher than that of MyoD at 1 week of induction ( Fig . 3A ) . Western blot analysis indicated that fast - twitch myosin , which appeared as a 200 , 000 - dalton protein band , was highly expressed in the cells incubated for 6 weeks ( Fig . 3B ) . Taken together with the data above , it is very likely that human UCB - derived MSCs are able to differentiate into skeletal myoblasts . Discussion The mononuclear cells separated from human UCB could give rise to adherent layer when cultured in low - glucose 620 Skeletal Myogenesis of Mesenchymal Stem Cells DMEM containing 15 % fetal bovine serum in our culture system . These adherent cells were observed to be spindle - and fibroblast - like under a phase - contrast light microscope . They expressed a panel of surface antigens , including SH2 ( CD105 / endoglin ) , SH3 ( CD73 ) , CD13 , CD29 ( β 1 integrin ) , CD49e ( α 5 integrin ) , and ASMA ( Fig . 1 ) , all of which were previously reported as BM MSC - related antigens by Pit - tenger et al . [ 6 ] . The null expression of hematopoietic and other surface antigens indicates that we have cultured a rela - tive homogenous population of MSC - like cells . Morphologi - cal characteristics and immunophenotypes are identical not only to those of MSCs obtained from adult BM [ 4 – 7 ] but also to those of MSCs derived from UCB by other investigators [ 17 – 19 ] , leading us to conclude that homogeneous cells pre - pared in our laboratory are no other than MSCs . It is unclear exactly what caused past conflicts in isolating MSCs from UCB for other investigators , but they may have been attribut - able to usages of different UCB sources ( preterm versus term deliveries ) , different culture media ( DMEM versus α - MEM ) , or different culture conditions [ 15 , 16 ] . UCB - derived MSCs have been demonstrated to be capa - ble of differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes [ 17 – 19 ] . We observed that MSCs prepared in our laboratory also possess osteogenic , adipogenic , and neurogenic poten - tial in vitro ( data not shown ) . This multipotent feature of UCB - derived MSCs is further reinforced by the myogenic potential that is proven in this work . Skeletal myogenesis is a developmental cascade that involves the regulatory MyoD gene family that determines the progress of multipotential mesodermal stem / progenitor Gang , Jeong , Hong et al . 621 Figure 1 .

Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting of umbilical cord blood – derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured in myogenic medium . ( A ) : Immunocytochemical staining of the cells cultured in myogenic medium for 1 week . The cells were stained with MyoD or myogenin antibodies followed by a horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) – conjugated secondary antibody and were colorized with the sub - strates . The control was stained only with the secondary antibody . ( B ) : Western blot of the protein extract from the cells cultured in myogenic medium for 6 weeks . The blot was stained with a fast - twitch antibody followed by an HRP – conjugated secondary antibody . The level of α - actin protein was used as a loading control . A B cells into myogenic lineage . The MyoD family is one of the basic helix - loop - helix transcription factors that directly reg - ulate myocyte cell specification and differentiation [ 33 ] . MyoD expression occurs at the early stage of myogenic dif - ferentiation , whereas myogenin is expressed later at the time related to cell fusion and differentiation [ 20 , 33 ] . Similar to muscle development , the two muscle - specific transcription factors are expressed during myogenic differentiation of BM - derived MSCs [ 28 – 30 ] . According to FACS and RT - PCR results of this study , these two factors are also expressed in UCB - derived MSCs during myogenic induction by myo - genic medium . MyoD expression was first detected from day 3 of induction and decreased thereafter so that there was no measurable level of MyoD mRNA and protein at week 1 . In contrast , expression of myogenin peaked at 1 week and diminished considerably by 2 weeks ( Fig . 2C ) . Mizuno et al . [ 29 ] , however , reported that MyoD1 expression is highest during the first 3 weeks of myogenic induction and remains at high levels even after 6 weeks of induction . This difference seems to originate from their use of processed lipoaspirate cells that were isolated from raw human lipoaspirates dis - playing multilineage mesodermal potential in vitro . On the other hand , it is known that myosin is expressed in myogenic precursors undergoing terminal differentiation . Likewise , we observed weak myosin expression in 3 - week cultures after myogenic induction and significantly enhanced expression at 6 weeks , in which approximately 55 . 7 % of UCB - derived MSCs are myosin - positive in flow cytometric analysis ( Fig . 2 ) . All observations by immunohis - tochemical staining , Western blot , RT - PCR , and FACS analyses indicate that the myosin was formed from 6 weeks of induction ( Fig . 3B ) . These data agree well with the study of a time - dependent myosin expression that showed the highest number of myosin - positive cells after 6 weeks of myogenic induction in processed lipoaspirate cells [ 29 ] . Our findings in this study suggest that human UCB - derived MSCs could be alternative cell sources to treat mus - cle injury or chronic muscular disease . For clinical applica - tion , however , the functional capacity of these cells needs be further studied in more complex in vitro and animal models .
