INTRODUCTION The rho - related small GTP - binding proteins play a key role in regulating the assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular growth factors . The addition of serum ( the active constituent of which is lysophos - phatidic acid , LPA ) to quiescent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells induces the rapid formation of actin stress ﬁbres and the assembly of focal adhesions and this can be completely blocked if the cells are ﬁrst microinjected with C3 transferase , a bacterial exoenzyme that ADP - ribosylates and inactivates endogenous rho proteins ( Paterson et al . , 1990 ; Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . Growth factors such as platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and insulin , on the other hand , stimulate poly - merization of actin at the plasma membrane of many cell types to produce lamellipodia and edge - ruffles ( Nistér et al . , 1988 ; Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . In Swiss 3T3 cells , this can be inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of rac , N17rac1 , establishing a distinct rac - regulated signal transduction pathway linking growth factor receptors to the polymerization of actin at the plasma membrane ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . The signals required for initiating actin polymerization in response to extracellular factors are not known , but there has been much speculation that changes in plasma membrane polyphosphoinositides could directly inﬂuence actin polymer - ization ( Stossel , 1989 , 1993 ) . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 bispho - sphate ( PtdInsP 2 ) , for example , can release monomeric actin from the actin binding protein proﬁlin and this could be a signal for polymerization ( Lassing and Lindberg , 1985 , 1988 ) . In many cell types there is often a much better correlation between actin polymerisation and the production of the putative second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 trispho - sphate ( PtdInsP 3 ) by activation of the enzyme phosphatidyli - nositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) ( Eberle et al . , 1990 ) . PI3 - kinase is a dimer consisting of a regulatory 85 kDa subunit that asso - ciates with activated tyrosine kinase receptors through its src homologous ( SH2 ) domains and a 110 kDa subunit that encodes the catalytic activity ( Carpenter and Cantley , 1990 ; Panayotou and Waterﬁeld , 1992 ) . LPA , PDGF and insulin have all been shown to affect the cellular concentrations of PtdInsP 3 ( Cantley et al . , 1991 ; Kumagai et al . , 1993 ; Van Horn et al . , 1994 ) and it has recently been shown that activation of PI3 - kinase is required for PDGF - and insulin - stimulated membrane ruffling ( Wennström et al . , 1994a , b ; Kotani et al . , 1994 ) . However , it has not been possible to determine where PI3 - kinase is required on the signal transduction pathway . 225 The small GTP - binding proteins , rho and rac , control signal transduction pathways that link growth factor receptors to the activation of actin polymerization . In Swiss 3T3 cells , rho proteins mediate the lysophosphatidic acid and bombesin - induced formation of focal adhesions and actin stress ﬁbres , whilst rac proteins are required for the platelet - derived growth factor - , insulin - , bombesin - and phorbol ester ( phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ) - stimulated actin polymerization at the plasma membrane that results in membrane ruffling . To investigate the role of p85 / p110 phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase in the rho and rac signalling pathways , we have used a potent inhibitor of this activity , wortmannin . Wortmannin has no effect on focal adhesion or actin stress ﬁbre formation induced by lysophosphatidic acid , bombesin or microinjected recombinant rho protein . In contrast , it totally inhibits plasma membrane edge - ruffling induced by platelet - derived growth factor and insulin though not by bombesin , phorbol ester or microin - jected recombinant rac protein . We conclude that phos - phatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 trisphosphate mediates activation of rac by the platelet - derived growth factor and insulin receptors . The effects of lysophosphatidic acid on the Swiss 3T3 actin cytoskeleton can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor , tyrphostin . Since tyrphostin does not inhibit the effects of microinjected rho protein , we conclude that lysophosphatidic acid activation of rho is mediated by a tyrosine kinase .

However , none of these pathways appears to be involved in the rapid effects of LPA on the actin cytoskeleton ( Ridley and Hall , 1994 ) . An essential genistein - sensitive tyrosine kinase appears to act downstream of rho in the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress ﬁbres consis - tent with the observation that several components of the focal adhesion multiprotein complex are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues ( Turner and Burridge , 1991 ; Bockholt and Burridge , 1993 ; Ridley and Hall , 1994 ; Schaller and Parsons , 1993 ) . However the mechanism by which LPA leads to the activation of rho is currently unknown . To deﬁne the role of PI3 - kinase in the rho and rac signalling pathways we have analysed the effects of the inhibitor , wort - mannin , on cytoskeletal changes induced by the addition of growth factors or by microinjection of recombinant rho and rac protein . Wortmannin is a fungal product that covalently binds to and inhibits the p110 kinase subunit of PI3 - kinase in the 1 - 10 nM range ( Yano et al . , 1993 ) . It appears to be highly speciﬁc , though at concentrations above 1 m M it has been reported to inhibit myosin light chain kinase ( Nakanishi et al . , 1992 ) . Wortmannin blocks PI3 - kinase activity stimulated by tyrosine kinase receptors , G protein - coupled receptors and the high affinity immunoglobulin E ( FceR1 ) receptor ( Arcaro and Wymann , 1993 ; Kumagai et al . , 1993 ; Yano et al . , 1993 ) . In addition we have used a combination of phosphotyrosine phos - phatase and tyrosine kinase inhibitors to determine if growth factor induced activation of rho or rac is dependent upon tyrosine kinases . We conclude that activation of rac by PDGF and insulin receptors is mediated by PI3 - kinase whereas acti - vation of rho by LPA is mediated by a tyrosine kinase . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Wortmannin , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , LPA , bombesin , insulin , sodium orthovanadate and rhodamine - phalloidin were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . PDGFBB was from UBI . Tyrphostin A25 was from Gibco - BRL / Life Technologies . Vanadate was activated as described by Mahadevan and Bell ( 1991 ) . Cell culture and microinjection Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % foetal calf serum . Quiescent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared for microinjection and treatment with growth factors as follows : cells were seeded at a density of 5 · 10 4 cells into 15 mm diameter wells containing 13 mm glass coverslips . Six to ten days after seeding , cells were serum - starved overnight ( 16 hours ) in DMEM containing 2 g / l NaHCO 3 . Recombinant V14rhoA ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 15 mg / ml ) , V12rac1 ( 0 . 6 mg / ml ) and C3 transferase ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) proteins were microinjected into the cytoplasm . Injected cells were localized after ﬁxation by co - injecting cells with rat immunoglobulin ( IgG ) at 0 . 5 mg / ml and staining with FITC - conjugated rabbit anti - rat IgG . Pretreatment with wortmannin was for 5 minutes prior to microinjection of recombinant V14rhoA or V12rac1 proteins or addition of growth factors . Cells were incubated with tyrphostin for 30 to 60 minutes prior to treatment with growth factors for 15 or 30 minutes as indicated . Microinjection was for a period of 10 minutes after which the cells were returned to the incubator for a further 15 to 30 minutes before ﬁxation . Immunoﬂuorescence For ﬁlamentous actin localization cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 5 minutes and incubated with rhodamine - phalloidin ( 0 . 1 m g / ml ) for 45 minutes . Cells were viewed on a Zeiss microscope , and photographed with Kodak T - MAX 400ASA ﬁlm . Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins Recombinant V14rhoA , V12rac1 and C3 transferase proteins were expressed as glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed on glutathione Sepharose beads ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) . The proteins were released from the beads by thrombin cleavage and puriﬁed as described by Ridley et al . ( 1992 ) . For V14rhoA and V12rac1 proteins active protein concentrations were determined by a ﬁlter binding assay using [ 3 H ] GDP or [ 3 H ] GTP as previously described ( Hall and Self , 1986 ) . Protein preparations showed only one band on Coomassie - stained SDS - polyacrylamide gels . [ 32 P ] Pi labelling of intact cells and measurement of 32 P - labelled lipids in cell extracts Swiss 3T3 cells were grown in 35 mm dishes to conﬂuence over 7 days and serum - starved for 16 hours in DMEM containing 2 g / l NaHCO 3 . The cells were washed and labelled in Hanks - type salt solution for 70 minutes at 0 . 25 mCi / ml as described by Hawkins et al . ( 1992 ) . The cells were then washed and left in 1 ml salts ± 100 nM wortmannin ( added from DMSO stock immediately prior to use ) for approximately 10 minutes at room temperature . The cells were then warmed for 3 minutes at 37°C and stimulated with 1 ml salts ( at approximately 37°C ) containing agonists . After 3 minutes stimulation the medium was poured off , the plates ‘blotted’ and 0 . 5 ml ice - cold 1 M HCl added . The plates were scraped on ice and cell - debris / HCl transferred to a small glass bottle . The plates were washed with 1 . 367 ml of HCl / MeOH ( 0 . 3 ml 1 M HCl , 5 mM tetrabutylammonium sulphate + 1 . 067 ml MeOH ) and residual debris / solution combined with the ﬁrst extract . The combined scrapings were extracted using a Folch distribution of organic and aqueous phases ; the lipids were then deacylated with methylamine and the water - soluble head groups resolved by HPLC on a Partisphere SAX column as described by Jackson et al . ( 1992 ) . All samples were counted for 20 minutes ( i . e . 180 dpm = 3600 counts above background ) . RESULTS Wortmannin inhibits PDGF and insulin but not rac - stimulated edge - ruffling Quiescent serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells display only a ﬁne ring of polymerised actin at their periphery when stained with rhodamine - labelled phalloidin ( Fig . 1A ) . The addition of PDGF ( 3 ng / ml ) or insulin ( 1 m g / ml ) caused an increase in polymerized actin localized in plasma membrane edge - ruffles ( Fig . 1B and D ) and an increase in [ 32 P ] PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels ( see Table 1 ) . Membrane ruffling in response to these growth factors was completely blocked by a 5 minute pretreatment with 100 nM wortmannin ( Fig . 1C and E ) as was the rise in [ 32 P ] PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Table 1 ) . These results are consistent with recent published data showing that activation of PI3 - kinase is required for PDGF - and insulin - stimulated membrane ruffling ( Wennström et al . , 1994a , b ; Kotani et al . , 1994 ) . Previous work has shown that PDGF - and insulin - stimulated ruffling is mediated by rac since prior microinjection of a dom - inant negative rac mutant , N17rac1 , into Swiss 3T3 cells blocks growth factor - induced ruffling ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Further - C . D . Nobes and others 227 Receptor - mediated activation of rho and rac Fig . 1 . Wortmannin inhibits membrane ruffling stimulated by PDGF and insulin but not by microinjected rac .

Bar , 50 m m . 228 more , microinjection of recombinant , activated rac ( V12rac1 ) into quiescent cells induces membrane ruffling in the absence of growth factors ( Fig . 1F , and Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . In order to distinguish whether the wortmannin - sensitive step in mem - brane ruffling occurs upstream or downstream of rac , we have microinjected V12rac1 into cells that have been treated with wortmannin . As shown in Fig . 1F and G , membrane ruffling stimulated by microinjection of recombinant V12rac1 protein is not blocked by pretreatment with wortmannin . Bombesin - and PMA - stimulated membrane ruffling is not blocked by wortmannin In order to investigate further the relationship of activation of PI3 - kinase by growth factors to cortical actin polymerization and membrane ruffling we have looked at the effect of wort - mannin on bombesin , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) and activated ras - induced membrane ruffling . Bombesin , acting through a G - protein coupled receptor , is able to stimulate the accumulation of actin ﬁlaments in membrane ruffles via rac - activation ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) , but this neu - ropeptide does not activate PI3 - kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells ( Jackson et al . , 1992 , and Table 1 ) . Since bombesin can also stimulate rho - dependent actin stress ﬁbre formation , we have microinjected C3 transferase into cells prior to stimulation with bombesin in order to inhibit the rho - mediated pathway ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . We ﬁnd that bombesin ( 10 nM ) - stimulated membrane ruffling is not inhibited by wortmannin ( 100 nM ) ( Fig . 2A and B ) and we conclude that rac can be activated by PI3 - kinase independent pathways . This result also indicates that wortmannin does not have a non - speciﬁc effect on receptor - induced membrane actin polymerization in Swiss 3T3 cells . PMA is one of the most potent activators of membrane ruffling we have found in Swiss 3T3 cells , though unlike other stimulators of ruffling , no actin stress ﬁbres are formed even at later ( 30 minute ) times ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Oncogenic ras ( V12H - ras ) is also able to stimulate rac - dependent ruffling though the mechanism is unclear ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . Wort - mannin had no effect on PMA - induced membrane ruffles ( Fig . 2C and 2D ) or membrane ruffling that was stimulated by microinjection of recombinant V12H - ras ( not shown ) . Wortmannin does not block LPA or rho - induced actin stress ﬁbre formation The addition of LPA to quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells stimulates the formation of actin stress ﬁbres and new focal contacts by activating a rho - dependent signal transduction pathway and microinjection of recombinant , activated rho protein ( V14rhoA ) induces actin stress ﬁbres in the absence of added growth factors ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . In addition to tyrosine kinase receptors , PI3 - kinase activity can also be stimulated by heterotrimeric G protein - coupled receptors . For example , the chemoattractant fMLP acting through a G - protein coupled receptor in neutrophils activates a PI3 - kinase . Wortmannin blocks this response and prevents fMLP stimulation of the res - piratory burst and of actin polymerization ( Arcaro and Wymann , 1993 ) . LPA is also thought to act through a G protein coupled receptor , though this has not yet been cloned ( Van der Bend et al . , 1992 ) . A recent report suggests that LPA not only activates the p85 / p110 PI3 - kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells , but that this is dependent upon a functional rho protein ( Kumagai et al . , 1993 ) . In contrast , we ﬁnd that LPA - induced actin polymerisation is not accompanied by a rise in [ 32 P ] PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( see Table 1 ) indicating that , in this system at least , LPA does not activate PI3 - kinase . We do not know the reason for this discrepancy but it could reﬂect differences in Swiss 3T3 subclones . In support of the conclusion that PI3 - kinase activity is not required for rho signalling , we ﬁnd that 100 nM wortmannin has no effect on the ability of LPA ( Fig . 3A and B ) or microin - jected rho proteins ( Fig . 3C and D ) to stimulate actin stress ﬁbre formation . Even a ten - fold higher concentration of wort - mannin ( 1 m M ) had no effect on LPA - induced stress ﬁbres or focal adhesion formation ( not shown ) . Interestingly , LPA stim - ulates a signiﬁcant increase in [ 32 P ] PtdIns4P which is similar to the effects of EGF on these cells ( Jackson et al . , 1992 ) . Evidence that a tyrosine kinase is required for the activation of rho In order to further investigate the mechanism by which LPA activates rho leading to stress ﬁbre formation we have used the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate . Vanadate can increase intracellular phosphotyrosine levels in cells thereby acting as a signalling agonist of pathways that are regulated by tyrosine kinases . Indeed vanadate is able to cause ﬁbroblast transformation ( Smith , 1983 ; Klarlund , 1985 ) and is known to have insulin - like actions on some cells by stimula - tion of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity ( Tamura et al . , 1984 ) . We ﬁnd that vanadate ( 100 m M ) strongly stimulates the formation of actin stress ﬁbres but not membrane ruffles in serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells ( Fig . 4A ) . The response to this concentration of vanadate is maximal at 20 - 30 minutes con - C . D . Nobes and others Table 1 .

Incubations were terminated and lipids extracted and analysed as described in Materials and Methods . The values presented are dpm ± range for two independent dishes of cells . 229 Receptor - mediated activation of rho and rac sistent with a lag required for entry of vanadate into the cell . As for LPA , vanadate - stimulated stress ﬁbres are inhibited in cells microinjected with C3 transferase , which inactivates rho proteins ( Fig . 4B ) , indicating that activation of a tyrosine kinase can lead to activation of rho and the induction of stress ﬁbre formation . We have shown previously that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibits the formation of actin stress ﬁbres not only by LPA but also by microinjected rho ( Ridley and Hall , 1994 ) . It was not possible therefore to analyse the role of tyrosine kinases upstream of rho . Neither the erbstatin analogue , methyl 2 , 5 - dihydroxycinnamate , nor herbimycin A ( a potent inhibitor of pp60 src activation ) signiﬁcantly inhibited stress ﬁbre formation in response to growth factor stimulation in Swiss 3T3 cells ( Ridley and Hall , 1994 ) . We now report here , that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor , tyrphostin A25 ( 150 m M ) blocks new stress ﬁbre formation stimulated by LPA ( Fig . 4C and D ) but not by microinjected rho protein ( Fig . 4E and F ) . Further - more , tyrphostin A25 also inhibits the ability of vanadate to activate rho ( Fig . 4G and H ) . DISCUSSION In this paper we have examined components of growth factor - stimulated signalling pathways that activate the small GTP - binding proteins rho and rac . Firstly we have investigated the role of PI3 - kinase in rho and rac mediated signal transduction pathways by using a recently characterised inhibitor of PI3 - kinase , wortmannin . Our results are consistent with recently published data showing that activation of PI3 - kinase is essential for membrane edge - ruffling stimulated by PDGF and insulin ( Wennström et al . , 1994a , b ; Kotani et al . , 1994 ) . We have previously shown that rac is required for membrane ruffling stimulated by PDGF and insulin and we have now shown using the microinjection technique , that wortmannin does not inhibit rac - induced ruffling . We conclude that PtdInsP 3 generated by the p85 / p110 PI3 - kinase is required for activation of rac . One possiblity is that the lipid can activate a guanine nucleotide exchange factor , or inhibit a GTPase acti - vating protein ( GAP ) . At least ﬁve mammalian GAPs active on rac have been identiﬁed so far , rhoGAP , bcr , n - chimerin , Fig . 2 . Bombesin - and PMA - stimulated membrane ruffling are not blocked by wortmannin . Serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with bombesin ( 10 nM ) were ﬁrst microinjected with C3 transferase ( 100 m g / ml ) to block the rho - activated stress ﬁbre pathway that is stimulated by bombesin . C3 transferase injection reveals more clearly membrane ruffling induced by bombesin in Swiss 3T3 cells . Actin ﬁlaments are shown in cells microinjected with C3 transferase and stimulated with bombesin ( 10 nM ) without ( A ) or with ( B ) wortmannin ( 100 nM ) , or stimulated with PMA ( 100 nM ) without ( C ) or with ( D ) wortmannin . Cells were ﬁxed and stained for actin ﬁlaments with rhodamine - phalloidin . Bar , 20 m m . 230 abr and p190 but as yet their functions are unclear ( Lancaster et al . , 1994 ; Diekmann et al . , 1991 ; Heisterkamp et al . , 1993 ; Settleman et al . , 1992 ) . No exchange factors for rac have yet been described though members of the the family of dbl related proteins are likely candidates ( for review see Nobes and Hall , 1994 ) . Interestingly , p85 , the regulatory subunit of PI3 - kinase contains a domain with signiﬁcant homology to the rhoGAP family of proteins ( Otsu et al . , 1991 ) . p85 does not have GAP activity in vitro towards rac but it is possible that the two proteins could directly interact through this domain . Another candidate regulatory protein for rho - related GTPases is rhoGDI . This protein is thought to regulate the cycling of the GTPases on and off the plasma membrane and there is some suggestion that this can be affected by lipids ( Chung et al . , 1993 ) . In addition , however , it is clear from the work described here , that rac can also be activated through a PI3 - kinase inde - pendent route in Swiss 3T3 cells , since rac activation by bombesin , PMA or oncogenic ras is unaffected by wortman - nin . The rho - mediated signal transduction pathway activated by LPA or by bombesin in Swiss 3T3 cells does not require PI3 - kinase activity since we show that neither of these growth factors stimulates a rise in PtdInsP 3 . Furthermore , stress ﬁbre formation is not blocked by wortmannin . We have previously shown that a genistein - sensitive tyrosine kinase is involved in this signal transduction pathway but since genistein blocked the activity of microinjected rho , we were unable to address the possibility that a tyrosine kinase also acted upstream as well as downstream of rho ( Ridley and Hall , 1994 ) . Here we provide evidence that a tyrosine kinase is indeed required for activation of rho by LPA . We have found that tyrphostin blocks stress ﬁbre formation stimulated by LPA but not by microin - C .

Tyrphostins are competitive inhibitors of tyrosine kinases that have been engineered to mimic the structure of a phosphorylated tyrosine residue in a peptide chain ( Levitski , 1990 ) . They do not affect the activity of protein kinase A , protein kinase C , serine kinases or threonine kinases ( Levitski , 1990 ) . Presumably tyrphostin in this system has a different substrate speciﬁcity to that of genistein thereby allowing us to deﬁne at least two candidate tyrosine kinases in the LPA / rho / stress ﬁbre pathway ; one upstream and one down - stream of rho . It is noteworthy that tyrphostins have been shown to interfere with adhesion associated tyrosine phospho - rylation of pp125 FAK in endothelial cells in addition to reducing focal adhesion and stress ﬁbre formation ( Romer et al . , 1994 ) . We have also found that orthovanadate , a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , stimulates actin stress ﬁbre formation in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells . Furthermore this is blocked by microinjection of cells with C3 transferase , that ADP - ribosy - lates and inactivates rho , and by tyrphostin . It is likely therefore that vanadate leads to the activation of the same tyrosine kinase upstream of rho , that is activated by LPA . Since phosphatase inhibition leads to kinase activation even in quiescent cells , it seems likely that a tyrosine kinase / phospho - tyrosine phosphatase cycle is being maintained in a low basal active state . This nicely explains the observation that inhibi - tion of rho in quiescent cells , by microinjection of C3 trans - ferase , is not without effect ; cells round up and begin to detach from the substrate . We propose therefore , that activation of the rho GTPase switch is not an all or nothing event , but that increasing concentrations of rho can lead to a gradation of cellular effects .
