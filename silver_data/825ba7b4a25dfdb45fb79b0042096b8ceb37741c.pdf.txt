Yen 2 1 Department of Oncology , Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada T6G 1Z2 2 Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19111 , USA The vertebrate kinetochore is a complex structure that speciﬁes the attachments between the chromosomes and microtubules of the spindle and is thus essential for accurate chromosome segregation . Kinetochores are assembled on centromeric chromatin through complex pathways that are coordinated with the cell cycle . In the light of recent discoveries on how proteins assemble onto kinetochores and interact with each other , we review these ﬁndings in this article ( which is part of the Chromosome Segregation and Aneuploidy series ) , and discuss their implications for the current mitotic checkpoint models – the template model and the two - step model . The template model proposes that Mad1 – Mad2 at kinetochores acts as a template to change the conformation of another binding molecule of Mad2 . This templated change in conformation is postulated as a mechanism for the ampliﬁcation of the ‘anaphase wait’ signal . The two - step model proposes that the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) is the kinetochore - indepen - dent anaphase inhibitor , and the role of the unaligned kinetochore is to sensitize the anaphase - promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) to MCC - mediated inhibition . The ability of chromosomes to achieve spindle bi - orien - tation is key to accurate chromosome segregation . At the onset of mitosis , rapidly growing and shrinking micro - tubules ( MTs ) probe the cytoplasm in search of kineto - chores , which are macromolecular complexes assembled on opposite sides of the centromere that mediate interactions between the chromosomes and MTs . Once the sister kinetochores are attached to MTs from opposite poles , the chromosome undergoes a series of oscillatory motions that guide the chromosome towards the spindle equator . These oscillatory motions are dictated by the coordinated growth and shrinkage of the kinetochore MTs . Chromosome motility relies on the unique ability of the kinetochore to interact with the highly dynamic ends of MTs . This differs from other MT - based transport events that rely on interactions with a relatively static lattice of the MTs . The stochastic nature by which kinetochores encounter MTs is an error - prone process that can result in non - productive connections [ 1 ] . The kinetochore is therefore a highly complex machine that does not merely bind and affect the dynamics of its attached MTs but possesses quality - control mechanisms that detect and correct defective or nonproductive interactions . Mechanistic insights into these remarkable activities will only be achieved by identifying and characterizing the molecular components of kinetochores in a wide variety of species . General organization of the kinetochore The vertebrate kinetochore , as seen by transmission electron microscopy , appears as a trilaminar stack of plates that is situated on opposite sides of the centromeric heterochromatin of the mitotic chromosome [ 2 ] . In the absence of MT attachments , a meshwork of ﬁbers , termed the ﬁbrous corona , can be seen to extend from the surface of the outer plate [ 3 ] . The ﬁbrous corona and the outer plate contain the majority of the known MT - interacting proteins ( CENP - E , dynein , see Table 1 and Figure 1 ) [ 4 ] as well as checkpoint proteins ( Bub1 , BubR1 , Bub3 , Mad1 , Mad2 , Mps1 , Nuf2 , HEC1 , Zwint - 1 , ZW10 , Roughdeal ; see Tables 2 and 3 ) [ 5 ] that monitor the integrity of kinetochore attachments . The protein composition of the middle zone is not known . The inner plate is immediately adjacent to the centromere but also comprises centromeric chromatin that is speciﬁed by the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP - A [ 6 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Kinetochore assembly From a morphological standpoint , the vertebrate kineto - chore appears to be vastly more complex than the kinetochore of budding yeast . At the molecular level , the kinetochore compositions of all organisms studied to date share a surprisingly large number of proteins ( Figure 2 ) . One explanation that is commonly used to explain the apparent discrepancy between the morphological and molecular data is that the kinetochores of metazoans are assembled from repeated subunits [ 7 ] , where each repeat might reﬂect the unit module of the yeast kinetochore . This is indirectly supported by the observation that there are multiple copies of proteins at the human kinetochore as opposed to what is likely to be a single copy at yeast kinetochores ( some yeast proteins are dimers or tetra - mers , based on puriﬁcation of pre - existing subcomplexes [ 8 ] ) . With the increase in copy number , mechanisms must also be in place to assemble these modules into supramo - lecular complexes that form the trilaminar plates . Additional mechanisms might be also required to coordi - nate the multiple repeats folding into the highly con - densed three - dimensional structure . How the higher organization is achieved is unclear , but it might be Corresponding authors : Chan , G . K . ( gordonch @ cancerboard . ab . ca ) , Yen , T . J . ( TJ _ Yen @ fccc . edu ) .

Molecular evidence supporting a kinetochore assembly pathway came from studies in HeLa cells that showed that there was a temporal order in which proteins appeared at kinetochores . Some proteins , such as CENP - F [ 9 ] , an outer kinetochore protein , appeared at kinetochores between late G2 and prophase , whereas others , such as CENP - E and dynein , did not appear until after nuclear envelope breakdown ( CENP - E and dynein are MT motors , see Table 1 ) . Indeed , closer examination has revealed the following temporal pattern of localization for the following proteins : hBub1 / CENP - F / hBubR1 / CENP - E [ 5 , 10 ] ( Figure 1a ) . Bub1 and BubR1 , homologs of budding yeast mitotic checkpoint proteins Bub1 and Mad3 ( Figure 2c ) , are mitotic checkpoint kinases that assemble on kineto - chores during the late G2 phase of the cell cycle [ 5 ] . The temporal order in which proteins appear at kinetochores reﬂects , in part , the hierarchical relationship among these proteins . For instance , Bub1 in human cells has been shown to be required for the assembly of BubR1 , CENP - F , CENP - E and Mad2 [ 11 ] . However , these proteins do not exhibit a linear relationship , as exempliﬁed by the ﬁnding that the localization of Mad2 does not depend on CENP - E [ 12 ] , and the localization of CENP - E does not depend on CENP - F ( T . J . Yen , unpublished ) . hBub1 must therefore specify multiple branches of assembly that direct the assembly of CENP - F , hBubR1 and CENP - E ( Figure 1a ) . There are examples where the assembly of a protein depends on multiple branches . For example , the localiz - ation of CENP - F to kinetochores not only depends on hBub1 but also on CENP - I / hMis6 [ 13 ] , a constitutive kinetochore protein ( Figure 1a ) . As an aside , CENP - I / hMis6 also speciﬁes a separate branch that is required for the sequential assembly of hNuf2 / Ndc80 , Mps1 , Mad1 and Mad2 [ 13 , 14 ] ( Figure 1a ; T . J . Yen unpublished ) . As hBub1 assembly does not depend on CENP - I / hMis6 , the localiz - ation of CENP - F depends on two separate pathways . The signiﬁcance of this is unclear but might reﬂect a way to coordinate the different pathways so that no single assembly pathway outpaces the other . Recent efforts have shown that CENP - A and hMis12 deﬁne two major branches of the assembly pathway in human cells ( Figure 1b , c ) . Mis12 was identiﬁed in the ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as part of a collection of temperature - sensitive ( ts ) minichromosome instability ( mis ) [ 15 ] mutants . Vertebrate orthologs of Mis12 have been identiﬁed that exhibit limited sequence similarity with S . pombe Mis12 [ 16 ] . Although the phenotype of cells depleted of hMis12 is very similar to that seen for cells depleted of CENP - A , these proteins do not appear to depend on each other for their localization at kinetochores [ 16 ] , as was the case in ﬁssion yeast [ 17 ] . Thus , hMis12 represents a centromere / kinetochore assembly pathway that is inde - pendent of CENP - A .

Review TRENDS in Cell Biology Vol . xx No . xx Month2005 3 DTD 5 ARTICLE IN PRESS www . sciencedirect . com The deposition of CENP - A was assumed to be the crucial step in establishing centromere identities in all species . The mechanism by which newly replicated centromere DNA becomes incorporated into CENP - A - containing chromatin remains an open question . In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , simultaneous deletion of the chromatin assembly factor subunit cac1 and histone regulatory gene hir caused mislocalization of its CENP - A protein , Cse4p [ 18 ] . In S . pombe , CENP - A localization depends on Mis6 , Ams2 and the recently discovered Mis15 , Mis16 , Mis17 and Mis18 proteins [ 17 , 19 , 20 ] . The Mis16 – Mis18 complex seems to sit at the top of the hierarchy and is responsible for the recruitment of SpCENP - A to centromeres . Centromeres of mis16 and mis18 mutants exhibit increased levels of acetylated histone H3 and H4 [ 20 ] . The human Mis16 orthologs , RbAp46 and RbAp48 , are part the NuRD multisubunit complex that has deacetylase and nucleosome - remodeling activities [ 21 ] . These are the ﬁrst proteins reported to be responsible for CENP - A binding to centromeres in human cells and thus represent an important advance in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanism that speciﬁes centromere identity ( Figure 1d ) . Although it is clear that neither Mis16 nor RbAp46 / 48 acts speciﬁcally on centro - meric chromatin , speciﬁcity might come through their interactions with Mis18 and its orthologs [ 20 ] . Recently , separate groups have identiﬁed a complex of proteins that copuriﬁes with hMis12 [ 22 , 23 ] . These include hPMF1 , DC8 , C20orf172 , KIAA1570 , HEC1 ( highly expressed in cancer , human ortholog of yeast Ndc80 [ 24 ] ) , hNuf2 , hSpc24 , hSpc25 , HP1 a , HP1 g and hZwint - 1 [ 23 ] ( Figure 1c ) . HP1 proteins are heterochro - matin - binding proteins that bind to the tri - methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 ( triMe3K9H3 ) [ 25 , 26 ] . The histone methyltransferase suv39h1 modiﬁes lysine 9 of histone H3 at pericentric heterochromatin [ 27 ] ( Figure 2a ) . Simul - taneous knockdown of HP1 a and HP1 g reduced the level of Mis12 at kinetochores [ 23 ] . A proposed assembly pathway involves the epigenetic modiﬁcation of histone H3 at pericentric heterochromatin , and the recruitment of HP1 , which in turn , speciﬁes the assembly of Mis12 ( Figure 1b ) . Mis12 is then required for assembly of other kinetochore proteins such as hZwint - 1 and the hZW10 / RoughDeal ( Rod ) complex ( Figure 1c ) , which is at the outer kinetochore [ 23 ] . However , recent examination of human and Drosophila centromeric chromatin failed to ﬁnd heterochromatin - speciﬁc histone H3 modiﬁcation ( di - or tri - methylation of lysine 9 ) , leaving open the question regarding where exactly Mis12 and the associated proteins bind to centromeres [ 28 ] . Microtubule binding Kinetochores of metazoans contain the molecular motor proteins CENP - E [ 29 ] , dynein / dynactin [ 30 , 31 ] and KinI kinesin MCAK [ 32 ] ( see Table 1 ) . In addition , the kinetochore also contains MT - binding proteins including CLIP170 , CLASP / Orbit , EB1 , Sgo1 and APC ( adenoma - tous polyposis coli ) . These can be further separated into those whose localization at kinetochores depends on MTs ( APC and EB1 ) and those that bind to kinetochores independent of MTs ( CLIP170 , CLASP , hSgo1 ) . The functions of these proteins were recently reviewed [ 33 , 34 ] , and we have summarized this information in Table 1 and Figure 2 . Aside from these MT - binding proteins , the evolutiona - rily conserved Nuf2 – Ndc80 – Spc – Spc25 complex is also essential for kinetochore attachments [ 35 ] . How this complex speciﬁes microtubule attachments is unclear , but it might play an indirect role in organizing the supramolecular structure of the kinetochore [ 36 ] . The coordination among different MT - binding proteins is likely to be an important factor in specifying chromosome alignment .

Review TRENDS in Cell Biology Vol . xx No . xx Month2005 4 DTD 5 ARTICLE IN PRESS www . sciencedirect . com individual MTs might be averaged out so that the chromosomes display a much smaller range of oscillations that function to position the chromosomes midway between the poles . By extension , this might explain a long - standing paradox regarding why a bipolar - attached chromosome would move towards the pole that has the fewest MT attachments : the dynamics of multiple micro - tubules bound at the lagging kinetochore might just dampen each other’s activities . Future analysis of these MT - binding proteins will also have to move beyond the traditional ‘search and capture’ paradigm . A new mechanism for bipolar attachment has recently been described [ 37 ] whereby MTs nucleated from kinetochores become incorporated into the spindle [ 37 ] . The capture of the minus - ends of these kinetochore ﬁbers by astral MTs and eventual incorporation into the spindle pole is mediated by dynein [ 38 ] . These kinetochore ﬁbers have been observed to grow through plus - end - biased polymerization at kinetochores in Drosophila S2 cells . It is hypothesized that short MTs formed in the vicinity ( probably because of a high Ran – GTP concentration at kinetochores [ 39 ] ) are captured by the kinetochores . Alternatively , MT growth might be initiated by proteins at the kinetochore . The role of checkpoint proteins at kinetochores The mechanical interactions between the kinetochore and the spindle are monitored by Mad1 , Mad2 , Mad3 , Bub1 , Bub3 and Mps1 , an evolutionarily conserved group of checkpoint proteins ﬁrst identiﬁed in budding yeast [ 33 , 40 ] . Rae1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is structurally related to Bub3 . Both budding and ﬁssion yeast Rae1 are important for mRNA export [ 41 , 42 ] , but mammalian Rae1 has been reported to associate with hBub1 and contribute to the spindle checkpoint [ 43 ] . In higher eukaryotes , BubR1 is probably the Mad3 homolog , but it has evolved to contain a kinase domain [ 40 ] . BubR1 is localized on the outer plate of the kinetochore , where it is postulated to act as a mechanosensor that monitors the activity of CENP - E [ 44 ] . In vitro studies have shown that BubR1 kinase activity is stimulated when it interacts with CENP - E [ 45 ] . This suggests that the checkpoint activity of BubR1 might be regulated in vivo by conformational changes in CENP - E when it interacts with MTs . Similarly , Mad1 and Mad2 also respond to mechanical input as they are displaced from kinetochores with MT attachments [ 46 ] . The molecular basis by which MT attachment displaces Mad1 and Mad2 from the kinetochore is unknown . An intriguing explanation might come from the unexpected interaction between proteins of the kinetochore and the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) . Mad1 , Mad2 and Mps1 are localized to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC during interphase [ 47 – 49 ] , whereas a constellation of NPC proteins localizes to kinetochores during mitosis [ 49 , 50 ] . Nup358 / RanBP2 and RanGAP1 stand out as their localization at kinetochores is MT dependent and inversely related to Mad1 and Mad2 [ 39 , 51 ] . One intriguing model is that MTs deliver Nup358 / RanBP2 and RanGAP1 to the kinetochore , and these proteins compete with Mad1 and Mad2 for common binding sites . In vertebrate cells , all of the mitotic checkpoint proteins are associated with kinetochores at the onset of mitosis and persist there until the metaphase - to - anaphase transition [ 40 ] . In budding yeast , Bub1 and Bub3 are detected at kinetochores during normal mitosis . However , Mad1 and Mad2 are only detected at kinetochores upon activation of the mitotic checkpoint [ 52 ] . The discrepancy with the vertebrate kinetochores might be resolved if MT attach - ments occur more rapidly in yeast . Mad1 and Mad2 are therefore only detectable if the kinetochores are unoccu - pied by MTs for a prolonged period . This situation is not dissimilar to that of vertebrates as the mitotic checkpoint proteins and MT motor proteins CENP - E and cytoplasmic dynein accumulate to higher levels at unattached kine - tochores [ 33 ] . Upon MT attachment , Mad2 , Mad1 , BubR1 , Bub1 , CENP - E , dynein / dynactin and Bub3 are released , to varying degrees , fromthekinetochore [ 33 ] . Thisis partially due to dynein - dependent transport of some kinetochore proteins ( Mad2 [ 53 ] , CENP - E [ 46 ] , Zw10 [ 54 ] and Rod [ 55 ] ) off the kinetochore via the spindle MTs and also through direct release of proteins from the kinetochore into the cytoplasm ( see below ) [ 56 , 57 ] . The release of mitotic checkpoint proteins upon MT attachment at kinetochores has been proposed as a possible mechanism for silencing the mitotic checkpoint [ 46 ] . The role of checkpoint proteins was recently expanded with the discovery that hBubR1 is also required for kinetochore MT attachments [ 58 ] . Cells depleted of hBubR1 are unable to maintain stable kinetochore attachments . This defect can be reversed by inhibition of the Aurora B kinase ( presumably by stabilizing attach - ments ) [ 58 ] . It is unlikely that hBubR1 is directly responsible for MT attachments , but hBubR1 is more likely to regulate the activity of a MT - binding protein . CENP - E might be a target , given its association with hBubR1 . Other proteins are probably involved as the BubR1 defect is inconsistent with the mere loss of CENP - E function . The contribution of BubR1 to kinetochore attachments might be analogous to how hBub1 is thought to play a role in attachments . The attachment defects seen in cells depleted of hBub1 are likely to arise from the combined loss of CENP - E , CENP - F and hBubR1 from kinetochores [ 11 ] . Checkpoint mechanisms How defective kinetochore – microtubule attachment is detected remains an open question , but we are in a better position to explain how the checkpoint proteins effect inhibition of the anaphase - promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) , the E3 ubiquitin ligase that drives progression through mitosis . An earlier model for how Mad2 contrib - utes towards the checkpoint signaling pathway was proposed based on the in vivo dynamic properties of Mad2 as well as its ability to inhibit the APC / C in vitro . Using an assay where the APC / C activity was dependent on an exogenous supply of Cdc20 , Mad2 was shown to bind to Cdc20 and prevent it from activating the APC [ 40 , 59 ] . Structural studies have shown that recombinant Mad2 can adopt an open form , O - Mad2 ( also known as N1 ) , and a closed form , C - Mad2 ( also known as N2 ) [ 60 , 61 ] . The closed form is more potent in inhibiting the APC / C in vitro Review TRENDS in Cell Biology Vol . xx No . xx Month2005 5 DTD 5 ARTICLE IN PRESS www . sciencedirect . com TRENDS in Cell Biology CENP - I CENP - H RanGAP1RanBP2 BubR1 Bub1 Bub3 Bub3 DC8PMF1 C20orf172KNL - 1 / AF15q14 Hec1Nuf2Spc24Spc25 hZwint - 1 hZw10hRodhZwilch Dynein / dynactin EB1 Dynein / dynactin CLIP170 Lis1 Clasp1 Mps1 TriMeK9 - Histone H3 Suv39hI CENP - B CENP - C HP1 Mis12 INCENPSurvivinBorealinAuroraB CENP - E Mad1 Mad2 Cdc20 Mad2 CENP - F hSgo1 Adenomatouspolyposis coli MCAK hSgo1 Alphoid satellite CENP - A Outer repeat – inner repeat – central core – inner repeat – outer repeat 35 – 110 kb Cnp1 Cbh1Cbh2Abp1 Swi6 TriMeK9 - Histone H3 Sim4 Mis6 Mis15Mis17 Nuf2Hec1Nuf2Spc24Spc25 Bub1 Bub3 Mad3 Bub3 Cnp3 Mis12Mis13Mis14 Sgo1 Ark1Pic1Cut17 Klp5 Klp6 Tip1 Mal3 Alp14 Klp2 Dis1 Mad1 Mad2 Mad2 Cdc20 / Slp1 Cbf1 Ndc80Ndc80Nuf2Spc24Spc25 MINDMtw1Nsl1Nnf1Dsn1 Mif2 DASH Dam1 , Duo1 , Dad1 , Dad2 , Dad3 , Spc19 , Spc34 , Ask1 , Hsk2 / Dad4 , Hsk3 CBF3Ndc10Cep3Ctf13Skp1 Bub1 Bub3 Mad1 Ipl1Sli15Bir1 Mad3Bub3 Bim1 Cin8 Bik1 Pac1 Stu2 Kar9 Ctf3 125 – bp CEN DNA Mad2 Mad2 Cdc20 C en t r o m e r e O u t e r k T / f i b r ou s c o r ona I nne r k T Centromere / kinetchore + TIPs MT - binding Clr4 CDEI CDEII CDEIII Cse4 COMACtf19 Okp1 Mcm21 Ame1 Budding yeast centromere / kinetochore Fission yeast centromere / kinetochore Vertebrate centromere / kinetochore ( c ) ( b ) ( a ) Centromere / kinetchore + TIPs MT - binding Review TRENDS in Cell Biology Vol . xx No . xx Month2005 6 DTD 5 ARTICLE IN PRESS www . sciencedirect . com because it has a higher afﬁnity than the open form for Cdc20 . These observations , along with other in vitro data , led Luo at al . to propose the Mad2 ‘Exchange model’ . In this model , kinetochore - bound Mad1 is thought to promote the conformational switch from O - Mad2 to C - Mad2 [ 60 ] . As the Mad2 - binding sites in Mad1 and Cdc20 are very similar , Cdc20 is envisioned to compete with Mad1 for C - Mad2 . As long as there are unattached kinetochores , sufﬁcient amounts of C - Mad2 are thought to be generated to tie up the cellular pool of Cdc20 and block its ability to recruit substrates to the APC / C . An inherent problem with this model is that the afﬁnities between Mad1 – Mad2 and Cdc20 – Mad2 might be too high to account for the rapid exchange of Mad2 between Mad1 and Cdc20 . Furthermore , De Antoni et al . recently showed that Mad2 D C , a mutant that cannot directly bind Mad1 alone , can still bind the Mad1 – Mad2 complex , which counters the notion that Mad1 is a chaperone for Mad2 – Cdc20 binding [ 62 ] . Template model A new ‘Template model’ has recently been proposed whereby Mad1 and C - Mad2 form a stable complex that recruits O - Mad2 that is present in the cytosol . Upon binding to the Mad1 – C - Mad2 complex , O - Mad2 is converted to C - Mad2 , which is released from the complex upon binding to Cdc20 . This model has its roots in an earlier idea that recombinant Mad2 can form homo - oligomers that were more potent at sequestering Cdc20 and blocking APC / C activity [ 63 ] . This oligomer theory was dispelled by the Mad2 R133A mutant , which cannot oligomerize in vitro but retains its abilities to bind Cdc20 and Mad1 and mediates mitotic arrest when overexpressed along with Mad1 in HeLa cells [ 64 ] . In the latest report , the same group showed that a preformed Mad1 – C - Mad2 complex can recruit another molecule of O - Mad2 through Mad2 dimerization . This was veriﬁed through the use of various Mad2 mutants . The Mad2 D C mutant was found to bind the Mad1 – Mad2 complex even though loss of its C - terminal 10 residues rendered it unable to stably bind Mad1 and Cdc20 . Thus , Mad2 D C must be associated with the complex by binding to Mad2 . The Mad2 R133E - Q134A mutant is incapable of forming oligomers [ 62 ] and was found to be unable to bind to the Mad1 – Mad2 complex . When the Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled Mad2 R133E - Q134A mutant was injected into PtK1 cells , it failed to localize to unattached kinetochores . By contrast , the Mad2 D C mutant retained its ability to bind to kinetochores despite losing its ability to bind Mad1 ( and Cdc20 ) . Functionally , neither of the Mad2 mutants retained checkpoint activity in vivo [ 61 , 65 – 68 ] . These results , combined with the in vitro data , strongly suggest that Mad2 dimerization is likely to occur at kinetochores and is an important feature of its checkpoint activity . By extension , the initial C - Mad2 – Cdc20 complex that is released from the kinetochore is speculated to further catalyze the conversion of the cytosolic pool of O - Mad2 into the inhibitory C - Mad2 . This proposed prion - like activity of Mad2 provides a mechanism that exponentially ampliﬁes the signal that was initiated at the unattached kineto - chore . Silencing of this pathway is believed to rely on p31comet ( CMT2 ) , a protein that promotes mitotic exit by selective binding to C - Mad2 and release of Cdc20 to activate the APC / C [ 69 ] . For both the Exchange and Template models , unattached kinetochores are proposed to convert the cytosolic pool of Mad2 into a form that can sequester Cdc20 , preventing activation of the APC / C . While this model ﬁts the in vitro data , the existence of alternative conformers of native Mad2 remains to be demonstrated . Regardless , the mechanism by which the kinetochore generates the ‘wait anaphase’ signal is likely to be more complex as it must take into account the roles of other checkpoint proteins . The Two - step model An alternative view proposes that kinetochores might not have to directly generate the inhibitor of the APC / C Figure 2 .

Instead , the ‘wait anaphase’ signal sensitizes the APC / C to inhibition by a factor that acts independently of kinetochores . This Two - step model ( kinetochore - dependent and - independent ) was proposed based on the discovery of the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) [ 70 ] . The MCC was identiﬁed in a biochemical screen for factors in HeLa cells that can inhibit the APC / C . The MCC consists of BubR1 , Bub3 , Cdc20 and Mad2 in near - equal stoichiometry and is several orders of magni - tude more potent at inhibiting the APC / C than the recombinant Mad2 that was used in all other studies . Unexpectedly , MCC was found to be present and active even in interphase cells , when the mature kinetochore has not yet assembled . Thus , MCC formation and activity does not depend on kinetochores . Importantly , MCC was found to selectively inhibit APC / C that was puriﬁed from mitotic cells . This contrasts with other studies that showed that recombinant Mad2 and BubR1 were only effective against interphase , but not mitotic , APC / C [ 71 ] . The existence of the MCC during interphase provides the cell with a rapid mechanism to inhibit the APC / C when cells enter mitosis . By necessity , the afﬁnity between MCC and APC / C cannot be very high as the inhibition must be reversible in order for cells to exit mitosis . The role of the kinetochore is to provide a signal that maintains the interaction between the MCC and the APC / C . This was supported by reconstitution experiments that suggested that kinetochores might act on the APC / C to sensitize it to prolonged inhibition by the MCC [ 70 ] . This possibility is consistent with the recent ﬁnding that subunits of the APC / C are preferentially associated with kinetochores [ 72 – 74 ] . While these observations suggest that the APC / C might be directly modiﬁed by the kinetochore , it will be important to examine the dynamics of its interactions . Evidence supporting the existence of a kinetochore - independent inhibitor of the APC / C has come from several studies . As discussed previously , the assembly of the checkpoint proteins Mad1 , Mad2 and Mps1 , but not BubR1 and Bub1 , depends on CENP - I and HEC1 ( Figure 1b ) . Interestingly , cells whose kinetochores were selectively depleted of these proteins were able to delay mitosis in the presence of unaligned chromosomes . Importantly , the delay was still dependent on Mad2 despite the fact that its level at kinetochores had been reduced 10 to 20 fold [ 13 , 75 ] . This result is consistent with the presence of a kinetochore - independent inhibitor of the APC / C , such as the MCC . Additional evidence for a two - step model came from a detailed comparison of the mitotic timing of HeLa cells that were depleted of various checkpoint proteins [ 76 ] . This study showed that selective depletion of Bub1 , Bub3 and Mad1 checkpoint proteins from kinetochores did not signiﬁcantly alter the time cells spent in mitosis . Mitotic timing ( from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase A ) was accelerated ( from w 25 min to 12 min ) only when either BubR1 or Mad2 was directly depleted from the cell . This ﬁnding also conﬁrmed earlier reports that showed direct inhibition of BubR1 and Mad2 by antibody injections caused cells to accelerate through mitosis [ 66 ] . This study concluded that BubR1 and Mad2 act independently of kinetochores to establish the time cells spend in mitosis , regardless of the status of chromosome alignment . The role of unattached kinetochores is to lengthen this time , perhaps by sensitizing the APC / C to prolonged inhibition by BubR1 and Mad2 ( MCC ) or by generating an additional pool of inhibitor ( Mad2 ) . The MCC appears to be evolutionarily conserved as it has been identiﬁed in budding yeast [ 77 ] , ﬁssion yeast [ 78 ] and in Xenopus [ 79 ] . Interestingly , formation of the yeast MCC was found also to be independent of the kinetochore [ 80 ] . By contrast , the formation of the MCC in Xenopus egg extracts depends on kinetochores [ 79 ] . The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but might be due to inherent differences in the mechanisms that control the somatic and embryonic cell cycles . It will be important to test whether these complexes are competent to inhibit the APC / C that is puriﬁed from mitotic cells . Concluding remarks The past few years have witnessed an explosion in the number of newly identiﬁed kinetochore proteins in yeast and other organisms ( Figure 2 ) . The increase in the complexity , in terms of size and function , of the vertebrate kinetochore likely arose in response to the expansion of the genome as well as the transition from a closed to an open mitosis . Interestingly , these changes have not required drastic alterations in kinetochore architecture but rather appear to have evolved by accessorizing the primordial kinetochore . The ﬁnding that many proteins are conserved suggests a common core that , in ver - tebrates , has been expanded to accommodate newly evolved proteins that are essential for accurate chromo - some segregation . This expansion appears to have been achieved in part by simply replicating the core module to generate a string of modules that is organized into a cytologically visible structure . This concept is rooted in a model described by Brinkley and colleagues nearly 15 years ago when they presented evidence that mammalian kinetochores might be assembled from a repeat structure [ 7 ] . This idea might actually be extended to explain the curious observation that kinetochores in budding yeast appear to be clustered into a single focus rather than dispersed . If yeast kinetochores are indeed physically linked to one another , their interactions might form the foundations for how complex kinetochores evolved . The list of kinetochore proteins that have been identiﬁed is impressive . The question that naturally arises has to be : how many more proteins are left to be discovered ? The answer is obviously not known , but this question should stimulate efforts to reconstitute kineto - chore assembly in vitro . While this is a daunting task , identifying proteins that physically interact with each other is an important ﬁrst step . The ability to reconstitute and analyze subcomplexes in vitro , whose interactions are validated in vivo , would represent a major step forwards towards realization of this goal [ 8 ] . These efforts might also be of practical use as they might provide in vitro assays to screen for novel inhibitors of kinetochore assembly .
