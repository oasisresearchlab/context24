Recent data suggest that at physiological temperature SVs are internalized via clathrin - independent ultrafast endocytosis ( UFE ) within hundreds of milliseconds , while other studies have postulated a key role for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) of SV proteins on a timescale of seconds to tens of seconds . Here we demonstrate using cultured hippocampal neurons as a model that at physiological temperature SV endocytosis occurs on several timescales from less than a second to several seconds , yet , is largely inde - pendent of clathrin . Clathrin - independent endocy - tosis ( CIE ) of SV membranes is mediated by actin - nucleating formins such as mDia1 , which are required for the formation of presynaptic endosome - like vacu - oles from which SVs reform . Our results resolve previ - ous discrepancies in the ﬁeld and suggest that SV membranes are predominantly retrieved via CIE mediated by formin - dependent actin assembly . INTRODUCTION Neuronal communication depends on the regulated release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) by calcium - trig - gered exocytic fusion at specialized presynaptic release sites within active zones ( AZs ) ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Haucke et al . , 2011 ; Kononenko and Haucke , 2015 ; Rizzoli , 2014 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ) . To prevent expansion of the presynaptic plasma membrane and to sustain neurotransmission , SV exocy - tosis is followed by compensatory endocytic membrane retrieval and the reformation of SVs . In spite of more than 40 years of research , the mechanisms involved in SV endocytosis and refor - mation remain controversial ( Aravanis et al . , 2003 ; Cheung and Cousin , 2012 ; Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Kononenko and Haucke , 2015 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ; Wa - tanabe et al . , 2014 ; and below ) . Electron microscopy ( EM ) analysis of stimulated frog neuro - muscular junctions ( Heuser and Reese , 1973 ) and subsequent work on mammalian synapses has suggested that SV mem - branes are recycled by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) from the plasma membrane ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Kim and Ryan , 2009 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ) , a pathway that crucially depends on clathrin and its major adaptorprotein2 ( AP - 2 ) andoccursonatimescale oftensofsec - onds , atleastinnon - neuronalcells ( DittmanandRyan , 2009 ) . Us - ing the same preparation , but a different stimulation paradigm , Ceccarelli et al . ( Ceccarelli et al . , 1972 ) proposed an alternative clathrin - independent rapid mode of SV recycling by kiss - and - run exo - / endocytosis of SVs involving a transient fusion pore . While kiss - and - run exocytosis clearly has been observed in neuroendocrine cells ( Albillos et al . , 1997 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , its roleinprimaryneuronsisdebated . Recent datafrominvertebrate ( Watanabe et al . , 2013a ) and hippocampal synapses ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b , 2014 ) using high - pressure freezing EM paired with optogenetic stimulation suggest that SVs are recycled extremely rapidly via clathrin - independent ultrafast endocytosis ( UFE ) within hundreds of milliseconds . UFE is followed by clathrin - dependent SV reformation from internal endosome - like vacuolar structures ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . As UFE seems to depend on physiological temperature , the authors have argued that some of the discrepancies in the ﬁeld ( e . g . , regarding the time course of endocytosis ; Eguchi et al . , 2012 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Jock - usch et al . , 2005 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013b ; Wu et al . , 2014a ) may be related to temperature artifacts due to experimentation at room temperature ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . These discrepant views on the mechanism and speed of SV endocytosis may , at least in part , relate to the caveats inherent to the experimental approaches used to study SV exo - / endocy - tosis . PHluorins and related pH sensors report on pH changes that occur as a consequence of SV fusion and post - endocytic reacidiﬁcation . These assays offer a kinetic resolution that is limited by the rate of SV reacidiﬁcation ( approximately 3 – 4 s ; Atluri and Ryan , 2006 ) and , thus , is blind to fast modes of SV 854 Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 , February 22 , 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Inc . recycling such as UFE . Conversely , imaging approaches , such as high - pressure freezing EM ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b , 2014 ) or electrophysiological capacitance measurements at large syn - apses ( Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ; Eguchi et al . , 2012 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2014a ) are incapable of monitoring the endo - cytic fate of SV proteins inserted into the plasma membrane in response to stimulation ( Kavalali and Jorgensen , 2014 ; Kono - nenko and Haucke , 2015 ) . Here we combine optical imaging of pHluorin probes , capac - itance measurements , and ultrastructural analysis by EM to show that SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons occurs on multiple timescales from less than a second to several seconds at physiological temperature , yet , is largely independent of cla - thrin and its major adaptor AP - 2 . Clathrin - independent endocy - tosis ( CIE ) of SV membranes is mediated by formins such as mDia1 , an evolutionary conserved family of actin - nucleating proteins ( Goode and Eck , 2007 ; Levayer et al . , 2011 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) present within axons ( Ganguly et al . , 2015 ) and pre - synaptic nerve terminals ( Wagh et al . , 2015 ) . Our results resolve previous discrepancies in the ﬁeld and suggest that SVs are pre - dominantly reformed from endosome - like vacuoles generated via formin - mediated CIE of SV membranes . RESULTS SV Proteins Are Endocytosed on Multiple Timescales from Less Than a Second to Several Seconds at Physiological Temperature Previous measurements of the rate of SV endocytosis in hippo - campal neurons using chimeric reporters between SV proteins and a pH - sensitive pHluorin variant of GFP have yielded endo - cytic time constants between 6 – 7 and 50 s , depending on the duration and strength of the stimulus ( Armbruster et al . , 2013 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Kim and Ryan , 2009 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ; Wienisch and Klingauf , 2006 ) . These values are several orders of magnitude slower than UFE of SVs in optogenetically stimulated neurons express - ing channelrhodopsin reported to occur within 50 to 500 ms ( Watanabe et al . , 2013a , 2013b , 2014 ) . The direct cause of the decline in the pHluorin signal after exocytosis is the reacidiﬁca - tion of the endocytosed vesicles by the proton ATPase , which occurs with a time constant of about 3 – 4 s ( Atluri and Ryan , 2006 ) . It is therefore possible that previous experiments using pHluorin reporters might have missed UFE due to the limits imposed by the rate of reacidiﬁcation . Moreover , most optical re - cordings of SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons have been carried out at or slightly above room temperature , conditions un - der which UFE has been reported to cease operation ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . Given these caveats it appears that the kinetics of SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons deserve to be revisited . To measure the true rate of SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons at physiological temperature we used an approach that was independent of pH changes inside the retrieved SV . This method takes advantage of the fact that newly exocytosed pHluorin - tagged SV proteins can be quenched instantaneously by extracellular application of a low pH buffer to the medium us - ing fast perfusion ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ) . Concurrent blocking of vesicle reacidiﬁcation post - endocytosis by folimycin , a selective inhibitor of the proton ATPase ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ) allowed us to quantitatively determine the endocytosis of SV proteins as a fraction of the amount of exocytosed SV proteins at deﬁned time intervals ( t ) after the end of the stimulation ( Figure 1A and STAR Methods ) . We stimulated hippocampal neurons express - ing synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin with 200 action potentials ( APs ) applied at 40 Hz at physiological temperature ( 37 (cid:1) C ) and deter - mined the fraction of synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin retrieval 1 s after the end of the stimulation train . If all SV proteins were retrieved ultrafast , we would expect synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin endocy - tosis to be complete within 1 s at physiological temperature ( Wa - tanabe et al . , 2014 ) . We observed that only a minor fraction of about 20 % of all synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin molecules had un - dergone endocytosis at this time point ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Similar results were seen , if synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin was replaced by synaptophysin - pHluorin as a probe for SV endocy - tosis . In this case a fraction of about 30 % of all exocytosed synaptophysin - pHluorin molecules were retrieved within 1 s post - stimulation for 5 s at 40 Hz ( Figures S1A and S1E ) . Application of dynasore , an inhibitor of dynamin ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) and possibly other GTPases ( Park et al . , 2013 ) , largely blocked the formation of this acid - resistant pool , suggesting that our assay indeed measures SV endocytosis ( Figures S1C and S1D ) . When the experiment was repeated at 25 (cid:1) C , a temper - ature when UFE ceases to operate according to Watanabe et al . ( 2014 ) , the acid - resistant fraction decreased to about 10 % – 12 % of all exocytosed synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin molecules ( Figures 1B and 1D ) . Although UFE after optogenetic stimulation has been pro - posed to be the predominant pathway of SV retrieval up to 100 APs ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) , it is nonetheless possible that the capacity of the pathway is limited . To investigate this possi - bility , we measured the fraction of retrieved acid - resistant SV proteins using different stimulation paradigms and pHluorin re - porters . The fraction of endocytosed synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin within 1 s post - stimulation remained at about 20 % , if neurons were stimulated with a milder AP train for 5 s at 10 Hz and drop - ped to roughly 15 % following brief high - frequency stimulation for 1 s at 40 Hz ( Figure 1E ) . Probing the kinetics of SV protein internalization at physiological temperature independent of reacidiﬁcation in response to stimulation with 50 APs at 10 Hz was best ﬁt with a single exponential with a time constant of 25 . 5 s ( Figure S1B ) . Stimulation of synaptophysin - pHluorin - expressing neurons with only 10 APs in the presence of 4 mM extracellular calcium ( as in Watanabe et al . , 2013b , 2014 ) likewise resulted in the rapid retrieval of about 18 % of all exocy - tosed molecules ( Figures 1F and 1H ) . Interestingly , the fraction of rapidly endocytosed SV proteins rose to almost 50 % , if neu - rons were stimulated at physiological temperature with 2 APs at 4 Hz ( Figure 1H ) , suggesting that UFE is a fast pathway for SV protein endocytosis whose capacity is limited to stimulation with single or few APs ( as in Watanabe et al . , 2013a , 2013b ) , at least in hippocampal synapses . Consistent with this hypothe - sis , we found that the kinetics of SV protein internalization in response to stimulation with either 10 APs at 10 Hz or 2 APs at 4 Hz yielded fast and slow time constants of about 0 . 7 s and 26 s or 12 s , respectively , when ﬁt by a double exponential decay curve ( Figure 1I ) . Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 , February 22 , 2017 855 These results demonstrate that the majority of SV proteins un - der most stimulation conditions tested is not internalized with ultrafast , i . e . , subsecond , kinetics in response to electrical stim - ulation , although we observe a minor fraction of SV proteins to be endocytosed within less than a second , likely corresponding to ( ultra - ) fast SV endocytosis seen at hippocampal ( Watanabe Figure 1 .

While UFE may be an important pathway of SV endocytosis in neurons stimulated with single or few APs , the majority of SV proteins appears to be internalized on a timescale of 10 – 30 s following AP train stimulation at physio - logical temperature , consistent with prior data from conventional pHluorin - based kinetic measurements ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Kavalali and Jorgensen , 2014 ; Kim and Ryan , 2009 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Wienisch and Klingauf , 2006 ) . Thus , SV endocytosis depending on stimulation occurs on multiple timescales from less than a second to several seconds . Endocytosis of SV Proteins in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons Is Largely Independent of Clathrin and AP - 2 Endocytosis of SV proteins on a timescale of seconds is compat - ible with their internalization via clathrin / AP - 2 - mediated endocy - tosis ( CME ) . Conﬂicting data regarding the role of CME in SV endocytosis have been reported ( Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ; Gran - seth et al . , 2006 ; Kasprowicz et al . , 2008 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Nicholson - Fish et al . , 2015 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013b , 2014 ; Wu et al . , 2014b ) . While we ( Kononenko et al . , 2014 ) and others ( Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ; Kasprowicz et al . , 2008 ; Kim and Ryan , 2009 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ; Wu et al . , 2014b ) have recently shown that the kinetics of endocytic retrieval of SV proteins are largely unaffected by lentiviral knockdown ( KD ) of clathrin or genetic knockout ( KO ) of its essential adaptor AP - 2 , other reports ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Nicholson - Fish et al . , 2015 ) have suggested an essential role for clathrin in SV endocy - tosis in hippocampal neurons . One possible explanation for these discrepant results is the possibility that depletion of cla - thrin or KO of AP - 2 alone may be insufﬁcient to completely elim - inate all CME in neurons . We therefore investigated the function of CME in SV endocytosis by KD of clathrin in neurons from tamoxifen - inducible conditional AP - 2 KO mice . As expected tamoxifen induction of the AP - 2 ( m ) KO resulted in the near com - plete elimination of the AP - 2 complex ( < 17 % of WT levels , further depletion over time below this level caused extensive neuronal death ) measured by its a - subunit ( Figures S2A and S2B ; Kono - nenko et al . , 2014 ) . Transfection of AP - 2 KO or wild - type neurons from littermate controls with shRNA directed against clathrin heavy chain efﬁciently depleted clathrin levels to about 35 % of that seen in controls ( Figure S2C ) , in good agreement with previ - ous data ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Nichol - son - Fish et al . , 2015 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ; Wu et al . , 2014b ) . Thus , the efﬁcacy of CME in AP - 2 KO neurons depleted of cla - thrin is expected to be reduced to about 7 % ( 0 . 17 3 0 . 35 3 100 ) of control neurons . Consistently , we found CME of trans - ferrin in primary neurons lacking AP - 2 or both AP - 2 and clathrin together to be blocked completely ( Figure S2D ) . To assess the effects of CME blockade on the kinetics of SV protein endocy - tosis synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin - expressing hippocampal neu - rons from WT or AP - 2 ( m ) KO mice depleted of clathrin or express - ing non - targeting control shRNA were stimulated with 50 APs applied at 10 Hz at physiological temperature . Strikingly , synap - totagmin 1 - pHluorin exo - / endocytosis proceeded with unaltered kinetics following 50 AP stimulation , irrespective of the depletion of clathrin and / or AP - 2 ( Figures S2E and S2F ) . Similar results were seen if neurons were stimulated with 200 APs applied at 40 Hz ( data not shown ) . A second possibility why effects of clathrin depletion on the kinetics of SV endocytosis may have been missed is the use of different stimulation paradigms in different studies . To test this controlor clathrin - depleted neuronsexpressing pHluorin - tagged synaptophysin or synaptotagmin 1 were stimulated with compa - rably mild stimuli of 10 or 50 APs at 10 Hz or challenged with a high - frequency train of 200 APs at 40 Hz . SV endocytosis pro - ceeded with similar kinetics in control and clathrin - depleted neu - rons under all conditions ( Figures 2C – 2F and 2H ) , conﬁrming that clathrin is not essential for the speed of SV endocytosis , although clathrin / AP - 2 play an important role in SV reformation ( Kono - nenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) and possibly in SV pro - tein sorting . As other investigators have observed delayed kinetics of pHluorin endocytosis and / or reacidiﬁcation ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Nicholson - Fish et al . , 2015 ) , we tested whether differ - ences in the experimental protocol might be responsible for the discrepant results . We noticed that these prior studies had used a lipofectamine - based protocol for transfection . We therefore directly compared the effects of clathrin KD on SV neurons in total for scrambled shRNA and CHC shRNA for 10 APs stimulation and N = 6 independent experiments with n = 40 and n = 26 neurons in total for scrambled shRNA and CHC shRNA for 50 APs .

( legend continued on next page ) Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 , February 22 , 2017 859 endocytosis in neurons transfected using calcium - phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 . Strikingly , KD of clathrin by lipofectamine - based transfection reproduced the previously reported delay in synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin endocytosis and / or reacidiﬁcation in response to stimulation with 200 or 400 APs ( Figures 2G , 2J , 2H , and 2K ) . By contrast , the endocytic response of calcium - phosphate - transfected neurons was indistinguishable from con - trols ( Figures 2F and 2H ) , akin to AP - 2 KO neurons or lentivirally transduced clathrin KD assayed under different stimulation par - adigms ( Kononenko et al . , 2014 ) . The difference between cal - cium - phosphate - and lipofectamine - based transfection was not the result of the differential efﬁcacy of clathrin depletion . Cal - cium phosphate ( Figures 2A and 2B ) or lentiviral transduction ( compare Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Wu et al . , 2014b ) were at least equally efﬁcient if not superior to lipofectamine with respect to reducing clathrin expression . Consistent with that , clathrin KD by either method resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the amount of exocytosis elicited by electrical stimulation ( Figures 2I , S2G , and S2H ) , as reported before ( Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . These data argue that the previously reported dependence of SV endocytosis on clathrin ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Nicholson - Fish et al . , 2015 ) in cultured hippocampal neurons may have resulted from the use of lipofectamine as a transfection agent . One possibility is that lipofectamine directly or indirectly affects the rate of reacidiﬁcation , e . g . , by adversely affecting the mitochondrial membrane potential and there - fore neuronal ATP levels , resulting in delayed quenching of pHluorin - tagged SV proteins present in large endosome - like vacuoles ( ELVs ) accumulated in the absence of clathrin ( Kono - nenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with this possibility , we found lipofectamine - transfected neurons to suffer from reduced mitochondrial activity ( Figures S2I and S2J ) . Collectively , our data show that endocytosis of SV proteins in hippocampal neurons in culture can occur in the near absence of CME , similar to what has been observed at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( Heerssen et al . , 2008 ; Kasprowicz et al . , 2008 ) , photoreceptor terminals ( Fuchs et al . , 2014 ) , and at cochlear inner hair cells in vivo ( Jung et al . , 2015 ) . Of note these results are consistent with a key function for clathrin / AP - 2 and other adaptors in SV protein sorting from the neuronal surface ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Kononenko et al . , 2013 ; Kono - nenko and Haucke , 2015 ; Koo et al . , 2015 ) . These data do not rule out the possibility that CME plays a more prominent role in SV endocytosis at other synapses ( e . g . , reticulospinal synapses of the lamprey [ Evergren et al . , 2004 ] , which operate at low tem - perature ) , as suggested by acute peptide - based perturbation experiments ( Evergren et al . , 2004 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Watanabe et al . , 2010 ) . CIE of SVs Involves Formin - Mediated Actin Assembly As SV endocytosis in response to AP trains neither occurred pre - dominantly via UFE nor required clathrin / AP - 2 , we hypothesized that SV membranes might be internalized by a form of clathrin - in - dependent endocytosis ( CIE ) . Previous genetic , biochemical , and morphological data have established a key function for dy - namin in SV endocytosis ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Raimondi et al . , 2011 ; Rizzoli , 2014 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ; Takei et al . , 1996 ) . Lack or inhibition of dynamin or dynamin - binding SH3 domain proteins such as endophilin ( Gad et al . , 2000 ; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ; Ringstad et al . , 1999 ) is accompanied by the accumulation of ﬁlamentous actin at stalled endocytic intermediates in neurons and in non - neuronal cells , suggesting a close interplay between dynamin and the actomyosin cytoskeleton . We ﬁrst probed a potential role of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in SV endocytosis by applying para - nitroblebbistatin , a variant of the non - muscle myosin II in - hibitor blebbistatin ( Figure 3A ) that is photostable and , thus , non - cytotoxic ( Ke´piro´ et al . , 2014 ) . We stimulated synaptophy - sin - pHluorin - expressing hippocampal neurons that were either mock treated or treated with para - nitroblebbistatin with 50 APs at 10 Hz . Inhibition of myosin II activity by para - nitroblebbistatin caused a signiﬁcant delay in SV endocytosis resulting in a more than 2 - fold increase in the time constant for endocytosis and re - acidiﬁcation ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . These results are consistent with previous morphological observations in blebbistatin - treated neurons and in myosin II KO mice ( Chandrasekar et al . , 2013 ; Yue and Xu , 2014 ) as well as with the reported role of myosin II in endocytic membrane ﬁssion ( Flores et al . , 2014 ) . To further dissect the function of actomyosin , we explored the role of actin nucleation that underlies F - actin assembly and , therefore , actomyosin function .

We explored the role of these distinct types of F - actin in SV endocytosis using selective pharmacological inhibitors of N - WASP and formins ( Figure 3A ) ( Ganguly et al . , 2015 ) . Inhibition of formin - mediated assembly of linear actin ﬁlaments by the se - lective inhibitor SMIFH2 ( Ganguly et al . , 2015 ) resulted in a robust inhibition of synaptophysin - pHluorin endocytosis in response to electrical stimulation with 50 APs at 10 Hz ( Figures 3H and 3I ) . A similar , though slightly less pronounced inhibition was seen if neurons were stimulated with 200 APs at 40 Hz ( Figures 3J and 3K ) . By contrast , synaptophysin - pHluorin endocytosis pro - ceeded unperturbed in the presence of the N - WASP inhibitor Wiskostatin ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . Consistent with a prominent role for F - actin in SV , endocytosis treatment of neurons with the F - actin stabilizing drug jasplakinolide signiﬁcantly accelerated the kinetics of SV protein internalization ( Figures 3F and 3G ) . In contrast , treatment with the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin A had no effect ( Figures S3A and S3B ) ( consistent with Sankara - narayanan et al . , 2003 ) , possibly due to the recently described enhancement of formin - mediated actin nucleation by latrunculin that may counteract the F - actin destabilizing effects of the drug ( Higashida et al . , 2008 ) or the presence of differentially latruncu - lin - sensitive actin pools at synapses ( Bleckert et al . , 2012 ) . To corroborate these results from pharmacological perturba - tion of formin - mediated actin assembly by an independent approach , we used an shRNA - based strategy to deplete hippo - campal neurons of distinct formin isoforms . shRNA - mediated knockdown of the diaphanous - related formin mDia1 ( Figures S3C and S3D ) , a formin isoform present in neurons including synapses ( Figures S3E – S3G ) and previously implicated in en - docytic pathways in non - neuronal cells ( Gasman et al . , 2003 ; Levayer et al . , 2011 ) , slowed the kinetics of SV endocytosis similar to formin inhibition by SMIFH2 ( Figures 3L and 3M ) . These data indicate that mDia1 , and , possibly , other formin family members mediate F - actin assembly to regulate SV endocytosis . Figure4 . ForminandMyosinIIAreRequired for SV Endocytosis at the Calyx of Held ( A – D ) The calyx of Held terminals ( P8 – P12 ) were patch clamped and depolarized from (cid:3) 80 mV to 0 mV for 50 ms to deplete the RRP of synaptic vesicles . Application of blebbistatin and SMIFH2 leads to slower capacitance decays ( absolute in A and C and normalized in B and D ) . Traces represent the mean ± SEM of n = 9 , 8 , and 7 calyces measured for control , blebbistatin , and SMIFH2 , respectively . See also Figure S4 . To test whether the function of formins in SV endocytosis is restricted to hippo - campal synapses , we turned to the calyx of Held , a giant synapse in the auditory brain stem that can respond to ﬁring rates up to several hundred Hz and , thus , is ex - pected to capitalize on a particularly effective machinery for SV recycling . Ca - lyx of Held terminals ( postnatal days 8 – 12 [ P8 – P12 ] ) were patch clamped to measure capacitance responses at near physiological temperature ( 32 (cid:1) C – 34 (cid:1) C ) ( Renden and von Gersdorff , 2007 ) . The terminal was depolarized from (cid:3) 80 mV to 0 mV for 50 ms to deplete the readily releasable pool of SVs and capacitance changes as well as Ca 2 + currents ( Figure S4 ) were recorded in the presence or absence of the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin or the formin inhibitor SMIFH2 . Stimulation induced similar exocytic capacitance increases in control , blebbistatin - , or SMIFH2 - treated preparations ( Figures 4A and 4C ) . In controls , the exocytic capacitance jump was fol - lowed by endocytic decay on a timescale of several seconds . By contrast , SV membrane endocytosis was strongly reduced in blebbistatin - treated and nearly eliminated in SMIFH2 - treated calyces ( Figures 4B and 4D ) . As SMIFH2 ( Figure S4B ) but not blebbistatin ( Figure S4A ) application also led to increased cal - cium inﬂux into the calyx , we analyzed whether the adverse effect of SMIFH2 on the kinetics of SV endocytosis might be indi - rectly caused by elevated intracellular calcium levels . However , mimicking increased intracellular calcium by elevating its extra - cellular concentration ( Figure S4C ) had no effect on the kinetics of SV membrane internalization in the calyx ( Figure S4D ) . Hence , endocytosis of SV membranes requires formin - mediated actin assembly at the calyx of Held , akin to what is observed in hippo - campal neurons in culture . Our collective data identify a critical function of formin - medi - ated actin assembly in the endocytosis of SV membranes . Formins Are Required for the Formation of Endosome - like Vacuoles from which SVs Reform Given the functional importance of formin - mediated actin as - sembly in SV endocytosis , we explored the consequences of inhibition of formin function in SV endocytosis at the ultrastruc - tural level . Mock - or SMIFH2 inhibitor - treated hippocampal neu - rons were kept either at rest or stimulated with 200 APs at 40 Hz , ﬁxed 20 s afterward , and analyzed by thin - section electron microscopy ( Figure 5A ) . Stimulation with 200 APs elicited the Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 , February 22 , 2017 861 formation of internal endosome - like vacuoles ( ELVs ) that appar - ently had undergone ﬁssion from the plasma membrane . Stimu - lated neurons also displayed an increased number of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) formed at both the plasma membrane ( Figure 5B , CCP ) and at ELVs ( Figure 5B , ELV ) and of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . These were much lower in number compared to ELVs ( compare Figures 5C , 5D , and 5F ) and may reﬂect intermediates en route to SV reformation . Moreover , synapses contained plasma membrane invaginations devoid of a morphologically discernible coat ( non - coated invaginations ) irrespective of whether neurons had been stimulated ( Figures 5B – 5F ) . Inhibition of formin - mediated actin assembly by applica - tion of SMIFH2 reduced the number of ELVs to those seen in non - stimulated control neurons ( Figure 5E ) , while a concomitant large elevation in the number of non - coated plasma membrane invaginations was observed ( Figure 5F ) , suggesting a precur - sor - product relationship between these structures . In extreme cases , these invaginations adopted the shape of long tubular ex - tensions of the plasma membrane that apparently had failed to undergo membrane ﬁssion ( Figure 5A , lower right ) . By contrast , formin inhibition had no effect on the number or morphology of clathrin - coated intermediates ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . These ultra - structural observations suggest that formin - mediated actin as - sembly is required for the formation of ELVs , likely by facilitating ﬁssion ( Flores et al . , 2014 ) of non - coated membrane invagina - tions that may mediate CIE of SV proteins from the neuronal surface . DISCUSSION We show here by combined optical imaging of pHluorin probes , capacitance measurements , and ultrastructural analysis that SV endocytosis occurs on multiple timescales that range from less than one second to several seconds at physiological Figure 5 .

Moreover , we corroborate that in hippocampal neurons the kinetics of SV endocytosis are largely independent of clathrin and AP - 2 , consistent with data from a variety of sys - tems ( Fuchs et al . , 2014 ; Heerssen et al . , 2008 ; Jung et al . , 2015 ; Kasprowicz et al . , 2008 ; Kim and Ryan , 2009 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013a , 2014 ) . Instead , we ﬁnd that mammalian neurons including hippocampal neurons in culture and globular bushy cells that form calyx of Held synapses capi - talize on clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) via formin - dependent actin assembly , likely in conjunction with myosin II , to internalize SV membranes into synaptic ELVs from which SVs reform . Our data provide a possible explanation for at least some of the previous discrepant results regarding the time course and mechanism of SV endocytosis and recycling . Using an acid quench protocol ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ) to probe the rate of endocytosis independent of reacidiﬁcation , we show that in response to AP trains the majority of SV proteins is inter - nalized over many seconds , while a minor fraction of SV proteins ( 10 % – 30 % ) appears to be endocytosed rapidly at physiological temperature . Interestingly , we observe that about half of all SV proteins exocytosed in response to 2 AP stimuli are endocytosed with ultrafast kinetics : we estimate a t fast of 0 . 7 s , although the true time constant might be somewhat slower as the assay is ‘‘blind’’ to endocytosis that occurs during the stimulation . Irre - spective of these considerations , our results suggest that UFE has a low capacity that may be limited to single or few APs ( as in Watanabe et al . , 2013a , 2013b ; Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ) , at least in hippocampal synapses . Whether UFE represents a ki - netic component of CIE or is a mechanistically distinct pathway remains to be determined . Moreover , we demonstrate that previous data based on pHluorin imaging suggesting an essential role for clathrin in SV endocytosis may be explained at least in part by adverse effects of lipofectamine , e . g . , due to impaired reacidiﬁcation as a conse - quence of reduced mitochondrial function . Delayed pHluorin quenching in clathrin - depleted neurons transfected with lipo - fectamine , thus , likely reﬂects the accumulation of enlarged ELVs ( Heerssen et al . , 2008 ; Kasprowicz et al . , 2008 ; Kono - nenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) , which exhibit de - layed acidiﬁcation due to their decreased surface - to - volume ra - tio compared to small vesicles . The time course and mechanism of SV endocytosis determined here closely matches observa - tions in a variety of other systems . Capacitance measurements at the calyx of Held ( Eguchi et al . , 2012 ; Okamoto et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2014a ) , ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells ( Llobet et al . , 2011 ) , and inner hair cells ( Beutner et al . , 2001 ) , and of cerebellar mossy ﬁber synapses ( Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ) have revealed time constants for endocytosis that range from less than one second up to tens of seconds ( Okamoto et al . , 2016 ) , depending on stimulation . We observe a slowing of SV endocytosis with increasing stimulus strength at physiological temperature ( e . g . , about 0 . 7 and 12 s for 2 APs , 0 . 7 and 26 s for 10 APs at 10 Hz , > 30 s for 200 APs at 40 Hz ) in agreement with prior data ( Armbruster et al . , 2013 ) , although the precise t values vary depending on the experimental conditions ( e . g . , extracellular calcium ) and the pHluorin reporter used ( e . g . , we observe a tendency for faster kinetics of synaptophysin compared to synaptotagmin 1 internalization in conventional pHluorin [ compare Figures 2E and S2F ] and in acid quench [ Figure 1E ] assays ) . The latter may reﬂect distinct rates and / or ef - ﬁcacies of SV protein sorting at the cell surface ( Kaempf et al . , 2015 ; Kononenko et al . , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) among other possibilities . We show that the kinetics of SV endocytosis are largely inde - pendent of clathrin and AP - 2 , and , thus , of classical CME , at least in hippocampal neurons in culture . CIE of SV membranes has been observed at inner hair cell synapses from conditional AP - 2 KO mice ( Jung et al . , 2015 ) , cerebellar mossy ﬁber synap - ses ( at least for low to moderate stimuli ; Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ) , and in retinal bipolar neurons ( Llobet et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , our data are in good agreement with the observed formation of non - coated endocytic intermediates within 4 – 30 s in micro - wave - ﬁxed electrically stimulated hippocampal neurons ( Schi - korski , 2014 ) and in photoreceptors ( Fuchs et al . , 2014 ) . Finally , CIE of SVs is consistent with the surprisingly mild phenotypes of genetic KO of clathrin ( Sato et al . , 2009 ) , AP - 2 ( Gu et al . , 2008 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ) , AP180 ( Koo et al . , 2015 ) , or stonin 2 ( Kononenko et al . , 2013 ) on the kinetics of SV retrieval in different organisms and systems . We favor a model according to which clathrin - associated endocytic adaptors ( e . g . , AP - 2 , AP180 , or stonin 2 ) serve to concentrate SV proteins at endocytic sites on the neuronal surface to ensure their sorting into endocytic carriers formed largely by CIE . As these endocytic carriers pinch off from the plasma membrane by formin - mediated actin assem - bly and dynamin activity , clathrin coats assemble to facilitate the reformation of SVs from ELVs ( Figure 6 ) . Consistent with this model , ELVs accumulate following sustained or acute inactiva - tion of clathrin or AP - 2 ( Heerssen et al . , 2008 ; Jung et al . , 2015 ; Kasprowicz et al . , 2008 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Wata - nabe et al . , 2014 ) , resulting in depression of exocytic neurotrans - mitter release ( compare Figure 2I ; Jung et al . , 2015 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . This may relate to the fact that at least in non - neuronal cells clathrin coat assembly is a slow process with a lifetime of 60 – 90 s ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . Depending on the rate of membrane ﬁssion by formin / F - actin and dynamin that may conceivably be controlled by neuronal activity ( Armbruster et al . , 2013 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2014a ) , clathrin coat assembly occurs either on the plasma membrane ( e . g . , under conditions of sustained low - frequency stimulation [ Kononenko et al . , 2014 ] ) or on ELVs post - ﬁssion akin to the clathrin - coated structures observed on lysed nerve terminal preparations in vitro ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) . It is , therefore , possible that at synapses , where the rate of ﬁssion is low ( e . g . , reticulospinal synapses of the lamprey [ Evergren et al . , 2004 ] , which operate at low temperature ) , CME may play a more important role in regulating the kinetics of SV endocytosis ( Evergren et al . , 2004 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Watanabe et al . , 2010 ) . Future studies using tools ( e . g . , genetic models ) that speciﬁcally target CME but not CIE are needed to address this possibility . Our own data together with prior results favor a model in which the internalization step of SV endocytosis is driven by formin / mDia1 - mediated assembly of actin ( Ganguly et al . , 2015 ) , which has recently been shown to be required for SV endocytosis ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Linear actin ﬁlaments anchored to the membrane by formin / mDia1 provide a substrate for membrane ﬁssion by dynamin ( Armbruster et al . , 2013 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 , February 22 , 2017 863 Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) and endophilin ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ; Llo - bet et al . , 2011 ; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) that act in conjunction with myosin II motors ( Chandrasekar et al . , 2013 ; Flores et al . , 2014 ; Yue and Xu , 2014 ) to catalyze membrane ﬁssion . This pathway bears similarity to CIE in yeast , which requires the assembly of linear actin ﬁlaments by the formin Bni1 but not N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin networks ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . In this model , dynamin and formin / mDia1 - based actomyosin ﬁlaments cooperate to facilitate membrane internal - ization ( as seen for CIE of Shiga toxin [ Renard et al . , 2015 ] ) and , thereby , restore membrane tension , which likely is required for the maintenance of exocytic fusion competence . SV reformation by clathrin - dependent and possibly other budding events ( Wu et al . , 2014b ) can occur with a kinetic delay as synapses capi - talize on a large reserve SV pool ( Denker et al . , 2011 ) . Such a two - step mechanism ( Figure 6 ) may be of fundamental impor - tance for synapse function as it enables neurons to plastically control exo - / endocytic SV membrane dynamics in order to be able to respond to a wide range of stimuli ( single APs to hundreds of Hz ) at different types of synapses . How this pathway is kinet - ically controlled and how such control relates to synaptic activity will be an important subject of future studies .

A Model for the Mechanism of SV Endocytosis A schematic summarizing clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) of synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) . Exo - cyticfusionofSVsisfollowedbyactomyosin - driven membrane invagination , regulated by membrane - associated formins such asmDia1 , independentof clathrin and adaptors . The invaginated membrane undergoes ﬁssion by the combined forces of dy - namin and myosin II motors to form an endosome - like vacuole ( ELV ) . This process starts rapidly ( i . e . , less than 1 s ) after a brief stimulus , but depending on the number offused SVs maytake uptoseveral seconds to complete . Concurrently , adaptor pro - teins and clathrin accumulate on invaginating membranes and ELVs to cluster SV proteins and generate clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) , which will subsequently lose their coat to reform SVs . 864 Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 , February 22 , 2017 Beutner , D . , Voets , T . , Neher , E . , andMoser , T .

The light cycle runs from 6 am to 6 pm . METHOD DETAILS Preparation of neuronal cell cultures , tamoxifen treatment , transfection Neuronal cultures were prepared by surgically removing the hippocampi from postnatal mice at p1 - 5 , followed by trypsin digestion to dissociate individual neurons . Cultures were grown in MEM medium ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 5 % FCS and 2 % B - 27 . 2 m M AraC was added to the culture medium at 2 days in vitro ( DIV ) to limit glial proliferation . Cells were transfected at DIV 7 - 9 using a Calcium Phosphate transfection kit ( Promega ) . To initiate homologous recombination in neurons from ﬂoxed animals expressing a tamoxifen - inducible Cre recombinase cultured neurons were treated with 0 . 2 m M ( Z ) - 4 - hydroxytamoxifen ( Sigma ) immediately after plating . For medium renewal on DIV1 tamoxifen concentrations were increased to 0 . 3 m M and reduced again to 0 . 2 m M on DIV2 . Ethanol was added to control neurons in equal to tamoxifen concentration ( 0 . 2 m M ) . For calcium phosphate transfection 6 m g plasmid DNA , 250 mM CaCl 2 and water ( for each well of a 6 - well plate ) were mixed with equal volume of 2x HEPES buffered saline ( 100 m l ) and incubated for 20 min allowing for precipitate formation , while neurons were starved in NBA medium for the same time at 37 (cid:1) C , 5 % CO 2 . Precipitates were added to neurons and incubated at 37 (cid:1) C , 5 % CO 2 for 30 min . Finally , neurons were washed twice with HBSS medium and transferred back into their conditioned medium .

After 30 min neurons were shortly washed with NBA and returned to their original conditioned medium . For calcium phosphate transfection 10 m g plasmid DNA ( 6 m g synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin plasmid , 4 m g anti - clathrin heavy chain - sh - or scrambled - shRNA / mRFP plasmid ) were used . Generation and Use of Plasmids Superecliptic pHluorin - tagged synaptotagmin 1 was generated as previously described ( Wienisch and Klingauf , 2006 ) . Full - length synaptophysin fused to pHluorin was a kind gift from L . Lagnado ( Cambridge , UK ) . Lentiviral expression vectors for scrambled and CHC shRNA were kindly provided by Christian Rosenmund ( Berlin , Germany ) and described previously ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . For the clathrin knockdown experiments , a ubiquitin promoter - driven synaptotagmin 1 - pHluorin plasmid was used , since the synapsin promoter driven pHluorin constructs did not have sufﬁcient expression when coexpressed with the shRNA vectors . Alternatively , modiﬁed lentiviral expression vectors for scrambled and CHC shRNA were used in which RFP was replaced for full - length synaptophysin fused to pHluorin . For mDia1 knockdown experiments , a commercially available lentiviral shRNA vector against mouse mDia1 / DIAPH1 ( TRCN0000108686 , indicated as shmDia1 in the main text and ﬁgures ) and a Mission pLKO . 1 - puro Non - Target shRNA Control Plasmid DNA ( SHC016 , indicated as shControl in the main text and ﬁgures ) were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . Immunocytochemistry analysis of cultured neurons Cultured hippocampal neurons of wild - type or AP - 2 x CAG mice were ﬁxed after pHluorin imaging ( DIV12 , 5 - 6 days post transfection ) using 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and 4 % sucrose in PBS for 15 min at RT . Fixed neurons were blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 10 % ( v / v ) normal goat serum and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 for 1h , followed by incubation with primary antibodies in 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 1h . Unbound antibody was removed with PBS while bound was decorated with corresponding secondary antibodies ( coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 , 568 and 647 , Life technologies ) for 30 min in PBS plus 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 . For transferrin uptake cultured hippocampal neurons of AP - 2 x CAG mice ( DIV12 , 5 - 6 days post transfection ) were starved for 1 hour in NBA medium at 37 (cid:1) C , 5 % CO 2 and treated with 25 m g / ml transferrin coupled to Alexa Fluor 647 ( Tf - 647 , Life technologies ) in NBA medium for 30 min at 37 (cid:1) C , 5 % CO 2 . To remove unbound Tf - 647 neurons were washed with cold PBS supplemented with 10 mM MgCl 2 , twice with cold 0 . 1 M acetic acid supplemented with 0 . 2 M NaCl to quench surface bound Tf - 647 and ﬁnally twice with cold PBS supplemented with 10 mM MgCl 2 prior to 30 min ﬁxation at RT with 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and 4 % sucrose in PBS . Coverslips were mounted with DAPI - containing Immumount ( Thermo - Fisher ) . For mDia1 stainings , untransfected wild - type neurons or neurons cotransfected with GFP and shRNA plasmids were ﬁxed at DIV14 using 4 % PFA and 4 % sucrose in PBS for 10 min at RT . Fixed neurons were blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 10 % ( v / v ) normal goat serum , 1 % ( w / v ) BSA , and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min , followed by incubation with primary ( overnight ) and secondary ( 45 min ) antibodies in the same buffer . Unbound antibodies were washed with PBS after each step . To assess mitochondrial activity lipofectamine - or calcium - phosphate transfected neurons expressing eGFP were labeled for 15 min with 25 nM MitoTracker Red CM - H 2 XRos ( Invitrogen ) in basic buffer ( 170 mM NaCl , 3 . 5 mM KCl , 0 . 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM N - Tris [ hydroxyl - methyl ] - methyl - 2 - aminoethane - sulphonic acid ( TES ) , 5 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM glucose , 1 . 2 mM Na 2 SO 4 , 1 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 3 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 ) at 37 (cid:1) C , 6 days post transfection . Neurons were washed twice with basic buffer and imaged for 15 min at 37 (cid:1) C . Imaging was performed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with the Perkin - Elmer Ultra View ERS system and a Hamamatsu C9100 EM - CCD camera under the control of Volocity software ( Perkin - Elmer ) . Fluorescent intensities were quantiﬁed using ImageJ . CHC , AP - 2 and TF - 647 ﬂuorescent intensities were quantiﬁed in RFP positive neurons and normalized to CHC scr or AP - 2 WT CHC scr , respectively . mDia1 intensity was quantiﬁed by measuring the mDia1 levels in the somata of GFP positive neurons ( which are assumed to coexpress the shRNA plasmids ) and normalizing these values to mDia1 levels in non - transfected neurons ( identiﬁed by MAP2 staining ) in the same ﬁeld of view . MitoTracker Red intensity was quantiﬁed in eGFP - transfected neurons and was normal - ized to that measured in calcium - phosphate transfected neurons . Live imaging of SV endocytosis by probing resistance to acid quenching To track synaptic exo - / endocytosis via the synaptopHluorin assay , neurons were subjected to electrical ﬁeld stimulation using an RC - 47FSLP stimulation chamber ( Warner Instruments ) and imaged at 37 (cid:1) C ( unless stated otherwise ) in basic buffer ( 170 mM NaCl , 3 . 5 mM KCl , 0 . 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM N - Tris [ hydroxyl - methyl ] - methyl - 2 - aminoethane - sulphonic acid ( TES ) , 5 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM glucose , 1 . 2 mM Na 2 SO 4 , 1 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 3 mM CaCl 2 ( 4 mM for experiments in Figures 1F – 1I and 2C ) , 10 m M CNQX and 50 m M AP - 5 , pH 7 . 4 ) using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 40x oil - immersion objective , eGFP ( BP525 - 50 ) ﬁlter set , an EM - CCD camera ( Evolve Delta 512 ) and a pE - 300 white LED light source ( CoolLED ) . Images were acquired at 0 . 5 or 1 Hz frame rate , 50 - 100 ms exposure , with an EM gain value of 250 . Fast solution exchanges were achieved using a piezo - controlled stepper device ( Fast Stepper , Warner Instruments ) with a three - barrel glass tubing and perfusion rate of 1 ml / min . Quantitative anal - ysis of responding boutons was performed a custom - written ImageJ macro . Poststimulation time constants were determined by Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 . e1 – e4 , February 22 , 2017 e3 ﬁtting the monoexponential decay curve [ y 0 + A * exp ( (cid:3) x / t ) ] with the constraints y 0 = 1 and zero offset , using R and Prism 5 ( Graphpad ) softwares . To bypass the dependence of the classical pHluorin assay on vesicle reacidiﬁcation rate , a modiﬁed pHluorin - based protocol was devised ( Figure 1A ) . Reacidiﬁcation of endocytosed vesicles were blocked using folimycin . Extracellular pHluorin ﬂuorescence was quenched ( Q 0 ) for 15 s by locally perfusing the neurons with a modiﬁed image buffer where TES was replaced by [ 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethane - sulfonic acid ] ( pH 5 . 5 ) to assess the surface levels of pHluorin - tagged synaptotagmin 1 or synaptophysin . After a brief wash with the basic buffer , the neurons were stimulated electrically . A second acid pulse ( Q 1 ) was applied at a time t ( e . g . , 1 s ) after cessa - tion of the stimulus to quench all pHluorin ﬂuorescence on the surface . The difference between the ﬂuorescent signals during Q 0 and Q 1 corresponds to the fraction of SV membrane retrieved during the stimulus plus the time t thereafter . This value was divided by the peak amplitude of pHluorin ﬂuorescence to calculate the fraction of synaptotagmin 1 or synaptophysin internalized before Q1 . Decline in the intensity due to photobleaching was corrected by using the decay constant l that was obtained from observations of intensity - time courses of pHluorin boutons not responding to stimulation . The kinetics of endocytosis was obtained by applying Q 1 at different time points ranging from 1 s up to 10 s ( Figure 1I ) or 60 s ( Figure S1B ) poststimulus . Endocytic time constants were determined by ﬁtting the kinetic data points to monoexponential [ y 0 - A * exp ( (cid:3) x / t ) ] ( Figure S1B ) or biexponential [ y 0 - ( A 1 * exp ( (cid:3) x / t fast ) + A 2 * exp ( (cid:3) x / t slow ) ) ] ( Figure 1I ) decay curves with zero offset using Prism 5 ( Graphpad ) software . In Figure 1I , the value for y 0 was set as 100 % , assuming that endocytic internalization of synaptophysin - pHluorin starts at the end of the 0 . 5 ( 2 AP ) or 1 s ( 10 AP ) stimulation . In Figure S1B y 0 was left unconstrained as signiﬁcant fraction of surface pHluorin molecules is internalized during the 5 s ( 50 AP ) stim - ulation period . The acid quench methodology , thus , does not allow the determination of the exact onset of endocytosis with respect to the period of stimulation . Electron microscopy Following corresponding pharmacological treatment and stimulation protocol , stimulation chambers were disassembled and the coverslips were immersed into PBS with 2 % glutaraldehyde 20 s after the end of the stimulation . The coverslips were then postﬁxed with 1 % OsO 4 and 1 . 5 % potassium hexacyanoferrat and stained with uranyl acetate , followed by dehydration in methanol gradient , propylene oxide and Epoxy resin inﬁltration . After polymerization , coverslips were removed and 50 nm sections were cut and con - trasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . Images were obtained using a Zeiss 900 transmission electron microscope with Olympus MegaViewIII or Olympus Morada G2 digital cameras at 30000x magniﬁcation . The density of clathrin - coated vesicles , clathrin - coated pits , endosome - like vacuoles and non - coated invaginations were measured from the synaptic proﬁles with clearly visible active zone and adjacent synaptic vesicles . Capacitance Recordings at the calyx of Held The calyx of Held terminals ( P8 - 12 ) were patch - clamped in order to measure capacitance responses at near physiological temper - ature ( 32 - 34 (cid:1) C ) . Capacitance measurements ( sine wave amplitude of 30 mV with frequency of 1000 Hz ) have been measured using EPC10 / 2 patch clamp ampliﬁer ( HEKA , Germany ) . Acute brainstem slices were prepared as has been described previously ( Schneg - genburger et al . , 1999 ) . The extracellular solution contained 125 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 25 mM glucose , 25 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 . 25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 4 mM ascorbic acid , 3 mM myoinositol , 2 mM Na - pyruvate , 2 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 ( pH 7 . 4 , gassed with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 ) . The patch pipettes ( (cid:4) 10 M U ) were ﬁlled with an intracellular solution containing 1135 mM Cs - gluconate , 20 mM TEA - Cl , 10 mM HEPES , 5 mM Na 2 - phosphocreatine , 4 mM MgATP , 0 . 3 mM GTP , and 0 . 5 or 5 mM EGTA ( pH 7 . 2 ) . The terminal was depolarized from (cid:3) 80 mV to 0 mV for 50 ms in order to deplete the RRP of synaptic vesicles . 50 m M SMIFH2 was added to the extracellular solution , 100 m M ( + ) - blebbistatin was introduced via the patch pipette . Experimental Design A strategy for randomization , stratiﬁcation or blind selection of samples has not been carried out . Sample sizes were not chosen based on pre - speciﬁed effect size . Instead , multiple independent experiments were carried out using several sample replicates as detailed in the ﬁgure legends . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For analysis of experiments statistically signiﬁcant estimates were obtained from N independent experiments , with a total sample number of n ( e . g . , number of neurons measured ) . The statistical signiﬁcance between two groups for all normally distributed data ( e . g . , effects of chemical inhibitors or genetic knockdowns on endocytic time constants or the number of endocytic intermediates in EM proﬁles ) was evaluated with a two - tailed paired Student’s t test . The statistical signiﬁcance between more than two groups for all normally distributed data ( e . g . , effects of knockout and knockdown combinations , comparison of multiple stimulation condi - tions and pHluorin probes with the acid quench assay ) was evaluated using One - Way ANOVA ( Tukey post hoc test was used to deter - mine the statistical signiﬁcance between the groups ) . Signiﬁcant differences were accepted at p < 0 . 05 . A method to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach was not used . e4 Neuron 93 , 854 – 866 . e1 – e4 , February 22 , 2017
