Mus - cle histology is also heterogeneous showing rods and / or myofibrillar changes . Here , we report on three new cases , from two unrelated families , of severe CM related to novel homozygous or compound heterozygous loss - of - function mutations in CFL2 . Peculiar histopathological changes showed nemaline bodies and thin filaments accumulations together to myofibrillar changes , which were evocative of the muscle findings observed in Cfl2 − / − knockout mouse model .

The few reported cases are clinical and morphological hetero - geneous leading to early - onset and rapidly progressive phenotype to a milder condition characterized by limb girdle and axial muscle weak - ness . 8 , 17 , 18 Muscle histology shows features of nemaline or myofibrillar myopathy ( MFM ) , as well as coexistence of both of these histopathologi - cal changes . 17 Complete loss of cofilin - 2 function is generally associated to a severe phenotype , however , the precise mechanism through which cofilin - 2 defect leads to different structural abnormalities remains elusive . Here we report on the clinical and myopathological findings in three patients from two unrelated families harboring novel mutations in CFL2 , who presented an early - onset , severe form of congenital myopathy with peculiar histopathological findings of nemaline bodies and thin filaments accumulation . Detailed information about methods are reported in Appendix S1 ( Supporting information ) . 1 . 1 | Ethics statement The clinical and molecular genetic study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . Studies of muscle biopsies and molecular genetic analysis have been approved by our ethics commit - tee with written informed consent obtained for each patient . 2 | RESULTS 2 . 1 | Clinical history and muscle pathology Patient 1 is a 7 - year - old boy , first child of healthy consanguineous parents , presenting severe generalized muscle weakness that required continuous respiratory and nutritional support since birth . Neurologi - cal examination performed at the age of 4 years documented facial weakness that spared only extraocular muscles , macroglossia , and severe and generalized muscle weakness . Muscles masses appeared diffusely hypertrophic and with hardened consistency . Brain RMI , ECG and echocardiography were normal . Patient 2 is a 1 - year - old female , third child of non - consanguineous healthy parents . At age 20 days , she was admitted in ER for apnea episode and suction deficit with probable dysphagia . Clinical evaluation documented severe generalized hypotonia . Brain ultrasound , ECG and echocardiography were normal . Cranial nerves were spared . Only small distal movements of upper limbs were possi - ble . Lower limbs were plegic , abducted and extra - rotated . Patient 3 , the older affected brother of Pt2 , had a similar clinical picture and died at the age of 3 months for respiratory failure . Clinical features of all patients are summarized in Table 1 . Muscle biopsy was performed at the age of 4 years in Pt1 , 2 months in Pt2 and 23 days in Pt3 . In all patients rods were observed . In Pt1 and Pt2 myopathic changes were more pronounced and small areas of myofibrillar dissolution together to thin filaments accumulation and cytoplasmic bodies ( Pt1 ) were documented . ATPase reactions showed a type 1 fiber predominance only in Pt3 and immunostaining for dystrophin , sarcoglicans and merosin was normal ( data not shown ) . Detailed morphological features are showed in Figure 1A - C . 2 . 2 | Laboratory results Whole Exome Sequencing ( WES ) in Pt1 and targeted resequencing using a custom gene panel for muscular diseases in Pt2 , allowed us to identify three novel mutations in exon 2 of CFL2 : c . 256G > C ; p . ( Asp86His ) , homozygous in Pt1 , and c . 235G > T ; p . ( Asp79Tyr ) and c . 281delC ; p . ( Ser94LeufsTer6 ) in compound heterozygosity in Pt2 . Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutations identified in probands and in Pt3 , as well as heterozygosity for the mutations in their parents ( Figure S1 ) . Immunohistochemical and western blot , performed in Pt1 , con - firmed the cofilin - 2 reduction in muscle ( Figure 2A ) and slightly increased of CFL2 mRNA level was documented ( Figure S2 ) thus pro - viding evidence for the disruptive impact of the p . ( Asp86His ) change . The structural impact of the two missense substitutions was also supported by the homology model of the human cofilin - 2 that shows that these residues are engaged in intramolecular interactions impor - tant for the folding of cofilin - 2 in the region mediating the binding to actin ( Figure 2C ) . 3 | DISCUSSION Congenital myopathies related to CFL2 mutations are rare congenital disorders with wide clinical and myopathological heterogeneity . CFL2 encodes for cofilin - 2 that , together with cofilin - 1 and ADF / destrin , promotes actin - filament turnover in cells . 19 , 20 ADF and cofilin - 1 regu - late actin - filament dynamics at filament ends , 21 while cofilin - 2 has a higher affinity for filamentous actin and a slightly reduced actin - filament depolymerization activity . 20 , 22 Several morphological features like nemaline bodies , minicores , concentric laminated bodies and areas of F - actin accumulation have been reported in patients carrying mutations in CFL2 . These mixed phenotypes , overlapping nemaline and myofibrillar myopathies , sug - gest that expression of mutated forms of cofilin - 2 is causal to sarco - meric and extrasarcomeric cytoskeletal pathologies , 17 and highlights the functional importance of cofilin - 2 for F - actin depolymerizing activity and for the structural integrity of skeletal muscle tissue . A knockout mouse model of CFL2 was recently generated by Gurniak et al 23 to more precisely explore the physiological function of cofilin - 2 . In the Cfl2 − / − model , myofibers and sarcomeric structures were initially formed correctly even in the absence of cofilin - 2 . How - ever , within a few days after birth , sarcomeric structures progres - sively undergo derangement , start to disintegrate , and pathological FATTORI ET AL . 1235 T A B L E 1 C l i n i c a l f e a t u r e s o f p a t i e n t s p r e s e n t e d i n t h i s s t ud y i n c o m p a r i s o n t o p r e v i o u s l y r e p o rt e d f a m i l i e s w i t h C F L 2 m u t a t i o n s R e f e r e n c e T h i s s t ud y A g r a w a l e t a l 8 O c ke l o e n e t a l 1 7 O n g e t a l 1 8 C F L 2 m u t a t i o n p .

FIGURE 1 A , Thricrome Gomori ( a , for Pt1 , b for Pt2 , c and f for Pt3 ) shows myopathic changes with fiber size variability , internal nuclei , presence of numerous small atrophic fibers and increased fat and connective tissue in all patients . In Pt1 prominent endomysial fibrosis and few fibers with vacuolar changes and cytoplasmatic bodies are observed ( a ) . In Pt1 and Pt2 in larger fibers areas of green cytoplasmic material can be noted ( a and b ) . Nemaline bodies can be observed in Pt1 ( a , arrow ) and are numerous and more evident in Pt3 ( c and f ) . Abnormal sarcomere myofibrillar network and numerous area with uneven oxidative reaction can be documented in Pt1 and Pt2 with NADH staining ( d and e , respectively ) and correspond to the area of thin filaments accumulation showed in B . B , Fluorescence analysis reveals in both patients the myofibrillar network disorganization documented by the irregular immunostaining for desmin . Numerous areas positive for phalloidin and myotilin are indicative of F - actin - filaments accumulations . In both patients , a diffuse reduction of cofilin - 2 is also shown and spots of protein aggregations are observed in some fibers . Bar 50 μ m . C , Skeletal muscle ultrastructure shows in Pt1 ( a - d ) a wide array of myofibrillar changes including large areas of sarcomeric dissolution with accumulations of thin filaments and rods , cytoplasmic bodies , and autophagic vacuoles filled with membranous debris . Accumulations of thin filaments , nemaline bodies and M - and Z - lines misalignment were also observed in Pt2 ( e and f ) .

Thus , the Cfl2 − / − mouse rapidly develops all the hallmarks of a protein aggregate myopathy , similarly to what has been described in patients with homozygosity for the p . ( Val7Met ) change . 17 We describe three patients from two unrelated families , who presented an early and severe form of CM related to mutations in CFL2 . Only three CFL2 - related NM families have been reported so far , all carrying homozygous mutations in CFL2 associated with partial or complete cofilin - 2 deficiency . Similarly to the present findings , also in the previously reported cases has been demonstrated that the missense mutations had a pathogenetic role leading to a misfolding and accelerated protein degradation . 8 , 17 Consistently , nonsense - mediated decay has been reported for CFL2 truncating changes , 18 strongly pointing to loss of CFL2 function as the underlying mecha - nism of disease . Muscle biopsies showed in all patients of our series myopathic changes with atrophic and hypertrophic myofibers , internalization of myonuclei and multiple nemaline bodies , and accumulation of thin fil - aments were also documented mainly in Pt1 and Pt2 . Moreover , fibrosis , as well as sarcomeric disruption , were more pronounced in FIGURE 2 A , Western blot analysis from muscle of Pt1 shows a reduction > 50 % of cofilin - 2 compared to the median value of two unaffected , age - matched control ( Ct ) muscle specimens ( a and b ) indicating accelerated degradation of the mutated protein . B , ( a ) Multiple alignment between cofilin - 2 and the other actin depolymerizing factors expressed in mouse and human ( CFL1 and DSTN ) showing that aspartate residues ( D79 and D86 , red arrows ) altered in our patients are evolutionarily conserved among AC proteins . ( b ) Schematic diagram of CFL2 gene with previously reported ( black ) and presently identified ( red ) CFL2 mutations . Mutations reported in a compound heterozygous state are underlined . C , Homology model of the human cofilin - 2 bound to actin filaments based on the structure of cofilin - 2 from chicken ( Protein Data Bank , PDB 1TVJ ) and superimposed onto the structure of the paralogous cofilin - 1 bound to actin filaments ( PDB 3J0S ) . The protein monomers are shown in different colors ( the cofilin molecules are indicated by rounded arrows ) . Both the residues implied in the p . ( Asp79Tyr ) and p . ( Asp86His ) mutations are expected to modify protein folding and to cause defective binding of cofilin - 2 to actin filaments . The p . ( Ser94LeufsTer6 ) mutation implies the alteration / loss of a large portion of cofilin - 2 ( residues 94 - 166 ) necessary for the interaction of the protein with actin .

( Asp86His ) confirm - ing the observation of Ockeloen et al 17 that the pathology associated with CFL2 mutations may evolve from NM phenotype at younger ages , towards one more closely pattern resembling MFM with increasing age . These results mirror the pathologic evolution of Cfl2 − / − mice which , despite are normal at birth , rapidly develop a severe myopathy with thin filaments aggregates . 23 4 | CONCLUSION We report three new severe cases of CM related to novel inactivat - ing mutations in CFL2 . Only for the cases with null mutations , 18 our patients were more severely affected than previously reported fami - lies with CFL2 missense mutations . 8 , 17 Morphological features , con - sistent of thin filaments accumulations and myofibrillar changes , are evocative of the histopathological findings observed in Cfl2 − / − mouse model . Structural modeling analysis supports the pathogenicity of the three novel CFL2 mutations and indicates that mutated residues are involved in correct folding of cofilin - 2 , thus compromising its interac - tion with actin filaments . This observation may explain the myofibril - lar network disintegration that we observed in our patients and confirms that the activity of cofilin - 2 , to promote actin - filament assembly , might also be important for the postnatal maintenance of sarcomeric structures .
