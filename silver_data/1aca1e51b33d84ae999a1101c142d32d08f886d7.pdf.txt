European Journal of Medical Research SIgA in various pulmonary diseases Xintian Wang 1 , Jun Zhang 2 , Yan Wu 1 , Yuncong Xu 1 and Jinxu Zheng 1 * Abstract Secretory immunoglobulin A ( SIgA ) is one of the most abundant immunoglobulin subtypes among mucosa , which plays an indispensable role in the first - line protection against invading pathogens and antigens . Therefore , the role of respiratory SIgA in respiratory mucosal immune diseases has attracted more and more attention . Although the role of SIgA in intestinal mucosal immunity has been widely studied , the cell types responsible for SIgA and the interac - tions between cells are still unclear . Here , we conducted a wide search of relevant studies and sorted out the rela - tionship between SIgA and some pulmonary diseases ( COPD , asthma , tuberculosis , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , COVID - 19 , lung cancer ) , which found SIgA is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various lung diseases , intending to provide new ideas for the prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of related lung diseases . Keywords Secretory immunoglobulin A , Lung disease , Respiratory , Mucosal immunity Introduction SIgA is a kind of immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) antibody , which is mainly distributed in milk , tears , saliva , airway , gastrointestinal secretions , and other mucosal secretions , playing an important role in mucosal immune response , tumor formation , anti - allergy , and other aspects . For the respiratory system , with every breath , we inhale thou - sands of particles into the airway , posing many potential threats to the integrity of the lungs . The airway mucosal immune system serves as a powerful protective mecha - nism , providing innate and adaptive responses to these inhaled particles , inflammatory responses to harmful antigens , and tolerance mechanisms to harmless anti - gens . The failure of these responses may lead to increased antigen infiltration and repeated infections , or exces - sive immune response to harmless antigens , all of which may lead to chronic airway disease and a series of related lung diseases [ 1 ] . In this review , we summarized relevant information on SIgA mucosal immune system and inves - tigated how its dysfunction affects the pathogenesis and clinical course of a series of lung diseases . Overview of SIgA Synthesis of SIgA Typical SIgA molecules are composed of IgA , J chains , and secretory components ( SC ) . IgA and J chains are synthesized from plasma cells , which are located in the lamina propria of the respiratory tract , gastrointestinal tract , urogenital tract , and other mucous membranes . After synthesis , one J chain connects two monomer IgA to form dimer IgA ( dIgA ) . After the formation of dIgA , it is secreted from plasma cells and forms a dIgA – pIgR complex with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor ( pIgR ) expressed by epithelial cells [ 2 ] . Subsequently , under the action of proteolytic enzymes , the extracellu - lar segment of pIgR , namely , SC , combines with dIgA and finally forms SIgA [ 3 , 4 ] . Function of SIgA SIgA is the main antibody involved in local immunity . As the main responding factor of the mucosal immune system , it plays an indispensable role in resisting the * Correspondence : Jinxu Zheng zhengjxu @ ujs . edu . cn 1 Department of Respiratory Medicine , Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University , No . 438 , Jiefang Road , Jingkou District , Zhenjiang , Jiangsu , China 2 Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , Aoyang Hospital Affiliated to Jiangsu University , No . 279 , Jingang Avenue , Zhangjiagang , Suzhou , Jiangsu , China Page 2 of 11 Wang et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 299 invasion of external pathogenic microorganisms . It not only neutralizes bacterial toxins but also participates in the formation of the immune barrier and immune clear - ance . It can affect the progress of autoimmune diseases by mediating immune response [ 5 ] . Factors affecting the level of SIgA Studies have shown that SIgA level may be related to the level of steroid hormones . In particular , there is a remarkable positive correlation between the sex hor - mones , such as testosterone and estrogen and SIgA [ 6 ] . The level of SIgA is also regulated by different types of immune cells . T lymphocytes participate in the produc - tion of IgA . B lymphocytes , micro pleated epithelial cells ( M cells ) , and the molecules expressed by M cells ( acti - vating inducible cytidine deaminase and TGF ‐ β ) are also essential for the production of IgA [ 7 , 8 ] . In addition , various cytokines and the external environment can also regulate the level of SIgA . Studies have shown that there is a relationship between SIgA production and cytokine production [ 9 ] , TNF - β can up - regulate the expression of fpIgR and the production of SC , which is modulated by PI3K and NF - κB signal pathway [ 10 ] . IL - 10 , IL - 4 , reti - noic acid , and IgA - induced proteins were also identified as stimulators of IgA production [ 11 ] . In addition , it has been found in recent years that cold exposure may inhibit the production of B lymphocyte activating factor , leading to the inhibition of IgA secretion in bronchial epithelium , thus increasing the frequency of acute viral respiratory infection in cold weather . Therefore , it is suggested that temperature can affect mucosal immune function by reg - ulating the production of SIgA [ 12 ] . The relationship between SIgA and pulmonary diseases Pulmonary bronchial epithelium is a pseudostratified epi - thelium composed of many cell types , and its proportion is strictly controlled [ 13 , 14 ] . Bronchial airway epithelium is mostly composed of ciliary and goblet cells . In addi - tion , it also includes basal cells , globular cells , neuroen - docrine cells , and rare ionic cells [ 15 ] . Ciliary and goblet cells work together to remove foreign particles and other irritant stimuli of the air spaces by Mucociliary trans - port or clearance . Among them , Goblet cells account for 5 – 15 % of the airway epithelial cells of healthy people and their main function is to produce mucus . Goblet cells , are mostly absent in small airways . Ciliary cells are the most prominent of all epithelial cells , accounting for over 50 % of airway epithelial cells . The synchronous swinging of their cilia produces the mucus layer to the trachea and throat [ 16 ] ; Basal cells are pluripotent stem cells , whose proportion in respiratory bronchioles is relatively less compared to trachea [ 17 ] , They not only strengthen the epithelium and the underlying lamina propria , but also help promote the steady and regular regeneration of epi - thelium after injury [ 18 , 19 ] ; Globular cells are involved in host defense , accounting for 20 % of small airway epi - thelial cells [ 20 , 21 ] ; Neuroendocrine cells are rare [ 22 ] , which are considered to be related to oxygen induc - tion , smooth muscle tension and immune response [ 23 , 24 ] ; The rare ionic cells seem to control the viscosity of fluid and mucus on the airway surface [ 25 ] . Among them ciliary cells , goblet cells , globular cells and ionic cells have been shown to express pIgR , take part in the pro - cess of d - IgA formation and promote SIgA secretion to the apical mucus layer [ 26 – 28 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Along the air - way epithelium , SIgA helps to provide first - line mucosal protection against inhaled particles and pathogens . The dIgA produced by mucosal Plasma cell is transported to the apex of airway epithelial cells through pIgR , where it is released as SIgA . SIgA mediated immune response is involved in a series of lung diseases [ 1 ] . In Table 1 , we summarized the association between SIgA mediated mucosal immune changes and SIgA dysfunction with the most common lung diseases ( Table 1 ) . SIgA and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a chronic and complex respiratory disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation and respiratory symp - toms [ 52 ] . Modern medical research finds that decrease or lack of SIgA secretion in respiratory epithelium plays a role in the pathogenesis of COPD , due to a dysfunction of local immune response [ 29 , 30 , 53 ] . The destruction of the SIgA immune barrier will cause a pathological cross - talk cycle between the immune system and its adaptive branches , making COPD patients unable to normally drive the activation of adaptive immunity [ 54 ] . The loss of the SIgA immune barrier in small airways of patients with severe COPD is a complex process , which may be caused by pIgR - dependent defects in IgA transfection and SIgA degradation [ 27 ] . The lack of pIgR / SIgA in the airway will result in the continuous activation of the innate immune response , leading to progressive small airway remodeling and emphysema [ 55 ] . Gohy et al . linked the down - regu - lation of pIgR with bronchial epithelial reprogramming driven by TGF - β [ 31 ] . The inflammatory environment of COPD patients’ lungs is initiated by chronic infiltration of neutrophils . Inflammation leads to downregulation of pIgR through TGF , causing impaired IgA transport and subsequently a decrease in SIgA levels on the mucosa , and eventually contributing to the impaired lung IgA immune function in COPD patients [ 1 , 56 ] . Polosukhin et al . found that the expression of pIgR in the bronchial epithelium was reduced , and the IgA secreted in bron - choalveolar lavage was also reduced in the bronchial Page 3 of 11 Wang et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 299 mucosa area covered by the pseudostratified epithelium of COPD patients [ 53 ] . This may be connected with the reduced expression of pIgR gene in ciliated cells in the airway [ 57 ] . In COPD , the down - regulation of pIgR is clearer in the remodeling area of bronchial epithelium [ 53 ] . Richmond et al . found that pIgR - deficient mice Fig . 1 Production of SIgA in lung epithelial mucosa and its role in resisting the invasion of external pathogenic microorganisms .

European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 299 lacking SIgA would spontaneously develop into mice with COPD - like changes in their bronchial epithelium with age [ 55 ] . In addition , the reduction of SIgA or pIgR levels is also related to the severity of COPD . A study found , the level of pIgR in the bronchial epithelium of severe COPD patients was lower than that in the control group , and the pIgR and IgA transport in the bronchial epithelial cell of severe COPD patients was reduced [ 31 ] , This may be related to the chronic accumulation of CD8 + T lympho - cytes in the small airways . Compared with the IgA posi - tive airways , the intraepithelial and submucosal CD8 + T lymphocyte infiltration in the airways with IgA deficiency increases [ 53 ] . To our knowledge , there is no direct study on whether regional bronchial IgA scarcity is related to the rate and intensity of COPD exacerbations . However , an observational SPIROMICS cohort study showed that COPD patients with significantly reduced IgA levels of serum experienced more frequent and severe deterio - ration [ 29 ] . Since the lack of SIgA on the small airway surface is related to the progress of COPD , it can be con - sidered a potential new therapeutic target for COPD . SIgA and asthma Asthma is a chronic bronchitis disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation , airway remodeling , airway hyperresponsiveness , and elevated serum aller - gen - specific IgE concentrations . As an important factor involved in inflammation and regulating immunity , SIgA goes together with the occurrence and development of asthma . It may be used as an index to evaluate the sus - ceptibility , severity , and treatment effect of asthma . Some scholars found that the level of serum IgA was positively correlated with the results of asthma control test , and the IgA level of asthma patients has signifi - cant negative correlation with the prevalence of mod - erate – severe asthma . With the increase of serum IgA level , the severity of asthma could be better controlled and improved [ 58 ] . SIgA levels can be induced by differ - ent stimuli , such as cytokine IL - 4 [ 59 ] , or TGF produced by dendritic cells - β [ 60 ] . In asthma , pIgR expression is downregulated due to the release of IL - 4 and IL - 13 by Th2 - cells [ 32 ] . The decrease in mucosal SIgA leads to a decrease in immune rejection of allergens , while the immune system’s allergic response is enhanced ; In addi - tion , the immune regulatory effect of SIgA on dendritic cells and subsequent inflammatory suppression are impaired [ 1 , 33 ] . In a study done by Shkalim et al . among children in Israel , it was found that that asthma was the most common allergic disease in patients with selective immunoglobulin A deficiency ( SIgAD ) , based on evalu - ation of their clinical and immunological characteristics [ 61 ] . This may be related to the fact that patients with SIgAD cannot neutralize or prevent the absorption of allergens so they are prone to allergic diseases , such as asthma and food allergy [ 34 ] . Urm et al . conducted a case – control study and found that asthma patients are more susceptible to SIgAD than non - asthma patients , and SIgAD increases the risk of bacterial infections and recurring infections among patients with asthma . It was also found that an elevated white blood cell count is asso - ciated with low levels of serum IgA in asthma patients with recurring infections [ 34 , 61 – 64 ] . However , some studies have concluded that SIgAD , as an immunode - ficiency disease , may be related to increased serum IgE levels [ 61 ] . Shahin et al . have also reached a similar con - clusion . They have revealed serum IgA level is correlated with serum IgE level , and the correlation is significantly negative [ 65 ] . Several studies have confirmed that serum IgE levels of asthmatic patients are elevated [ 66 , 67 ] . This further shows that the progression of asthma is closely related to SIgA . In spite of all its protective effects on infectious , allergic and autoimmune disease , some studies have shown that SIgA has some negative effects on human biology . For instance , because of its function as esonophil and baso - phil activator , SIgA can perpetuate allergic reactions and exacerbations of asthma , although this is supposed to have a protective effect on parasitic infestations [ 68 , 69 ] . Further research is needed to understand the correla - tion of SIgA levels to severity of asthma . Overall , can be a potential target for treatment of asthma in future . SIgA and tuberculosis Pulmonary tuberculosis is a potentially fatal infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . A grow - ing number of studies have shown a protective effect of SIgA on various viral and bacterial infections , such as tuberculosis [ 70 ] . SIgA protects the mucosal epithelial barrier through different mechanisms [ 39 ] . On one hand , it can prevent bacteria from entering the lung by prevent - ing bacterial antigens from adhering to the mucosal sur - face through the SC [ 37 , 39 , 71 ] . On the other hand , it can accelerate the clearance of immune complexes through respiratory ciliary movement [ 72 ] , and stimulate antigen - presenting cells to activate T cells [ 38 ] , thus activating protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infec - tion [ 73 ] . However , When the body’s immune system declines , the strong mucosal immunity cannot trigger a decrease in SIgA production , making the body more sus - ceptible to infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis [ 36 ] . In mice , infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis , SIgA has shown to induce formation of great organized granuloma , which is a sign of effective immune activa - tion and disease control . SIgA has also shown to greatly reduce bacterial load of lung and as a consequence the Page 5 of 11 Wang et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 299 damage to lung is minimized [ 70 , 74 ] . Respiratory immu - nization with a DNA vaccine prepared with chitosan can protect tuberculosis by enhancing the production of SIgA in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) [ 75 , 76 ] . NP , a potential new nanoparticle adjuvant of the tubercu - losis subunit vaccine , can also increase SIgA and other immune proteins in lung lavage fluid to induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses [ 77 ] . Mice with reduced IgA and pIgR levels were more susceptible to BCG infection [ 78 ] . Rodriguez et al . showed that IgA - deficient mice immunized with Mycobacterium cell sur - face antigen were more susceptible to intranasal BCG infection than wild - type mice [ 78 ] . Further research is needed to understand if the stimulation of respiratory SIgA would modulate the pathogenic effects of Mycobac - terium tuberculosis . This remains an important yet unex - plored area . SIgA and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is the most common disease in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia . It has a poor prognosis and is a fatal respiratory disease [ 79 ] , charac - terized by excessive deposition of fibrous tissue in the alveolar septal area [ 41 , 80 ] . Some studies have shown that SIgA may promote the proliferation of human lung fibroblasts by promoting inflammation by induction of various cytokines , such as interleukin ( IL ) - 6 , IL - 8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) - 1 [ 81 ] , thereby further promoting the proliferation of human pulmonary fibroblasts and colla - gen contraction [ 40 ] . The excessive proliferation of lung fibroblasts will in turn results in excess production of extracellular matrix and thereby promoting human lung fibrosis [ 40 , 82 ] . In addition , Mota P et al . proposed that the bronchiolar epithelium secretes IgA into the airway cavity through pIgR , forming mucus rich in SIgA , which accumulates in the IPF lung [ 41 , 42 ] . It is worth noting that the accumulation of this mucus is related to the decrease of FVC . Some studies have shown that SIgA can bind to the surface of A549 cells . A549 is usually used as a cell line with AT2 cell phenotype in vitro experiments , which can promote the production of vascular endothe - lial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and transforming growth fac - tor ( TGF ) ‐ β [ 83 ] . Notably , these cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of IPF [ 84 – 86 ] . In addition , research suggests that TGF ‐ β is the strongest cytokine for fibrosis formation in IPF [ 87 ] , and is crucial for the production of SIgA . In addition , it can induce conversion of B lym - phocytes to IgA production . Therefore , an environment rich in TGF ‐ β may increase the number of IgA lympho - cytes and the concentration of IgA . In the lungs of IPF patients , a tertiary lymphatic structure can be observed , which is the formation of ectopic lymphocytes composed of a large number of IgA B lymphocytes . This circulating feedback leads to an increase in sIgA levels in the lungs of IPF patients [ 43 ] . However , the origin of fibroblasts accu - mulated in IPF remains elusive . Epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a possible mechanism [ 88 ] . In EMT , airway epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells located near the bronchiole lumen acquire mesenchymal charac - teristics and become fibroblasts [ 89 ] , and these cells react to SIgA in airway mucus after coming in contact with it , thus intensifying the formation of fibrosis [ 90 ] . Some research shows that this may be related to TGF - β / Smad pathway [ 91 ] . Therefore , this pathway can be used as a target for treating the pulmonary interstitial fibrosis . In the bleomycin - induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model , dasatinib , an inhibitor of the TGF - β / Smad pathway , can inhibit the EMT of mouse alveolar and bronchial epithe - lial cells , thereby slowing down the progress of pulmo - nary fibrosis by reducing the reaction with SIgA [ 91 ] . In addition , Ten Klooster L et al . found , that serum IgA level can be treated as a prognostic biomarker of IPF , and high serum IgA level indicates a worse prognosis [ 92 ] . The above studies fully show that SIgA is significantly related to the progress and prognosis of IPF patients . In addition , studies have shown that SIgA can promote the occurrence and development of IPF due to its abil - ity to bind to transferrin receptor ( TfR ) CD71 , thereby blocking the binding of SIgA and CD71 [ 40 ] . This also provides a new target for the treatment of IPF . How - ever , other studies show that CD71 does not seem to be the only receptor involved . Because as a key receptor for human life , CD71 is necessary for both cell iron introduc - tion and cell maintenance . Therefore , it seems that it is not feasible to eliminate the effect of SIgA on some fibro - genic diseases by targeting CD71 , and its feasibility needs to be further studied [ 93 ] . Recently , it has been found that ANXA2 , which is expressed in airway epithelial cells , is a new receptor for SIgA . Immunohistochemistry of lung sections shows that ANXA2 is clearly expressed in airway epithelial cells [ 94 ] . Further research is needed to explore the interaction between ANXA2 or other possible recep - tors and SIgA in IPF , which can provide new ideas for our treatment of IPF . SIgA and COVID - 19 The COVID - 19 pandemic caused by severe acute respira - tory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has carried a large threat to public health . The main transmission route of SARS - CoV - 2 is inhaling respiratory droplets which contain virus particles [ 95 ] , inducing the body to produce SIgA antibodies in saliva , nasal juice , and nasal cavity , thereby activating mucosal immune response and limiting the virus to the upper respiratory tract , result - ing in asymptomatic infection or only mild symptoms Page 6 of 11 Wang et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 299 [ 49 ] . SIgA plays a part in antiviral protective immunity . The determination of IgA in saliva and serum as a marker deserves further study in SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 96 ] . It has been found that SIgA in the saliva of severe COVID - 19 patients is also reactive to non - novel corona - virus , and this heterologous immune response consists of a non - protective cross - reaction [ 97 ] . Similarly , another study showed that cross reactive SARS - CoV - 2 SIgA also existed in the saliva of people non - infected with the SARS - CoV - 2 virus , indicating that SIgA may be helpful in preventing SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 98 ] . An investiga - tion found that the positive rate of SARS - CoV - 2 reactive saliva IgA antibody in Japanese people not infected with novel coronavirus was unexpectedly high , which may be an important reason for the low prevalence of COVID - 19 in Japan [ 99 ] . There is evidence that the susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection increases with age , the positive rate of reac - tive saliva IgA antibody in minors is higher than that in adults , which helps reduce their susceptibility to the virus [ 99 ] . In contrast , the susceptibility of the elderly is much higher [ 100 , 101 ] , which may be related to the decrease of SARS - CoV - 2 reactive saliva IgA antibody with age [ 102 ] , or the lack of mannose - binding lectin [ 103 ] . These stud - ies indicate that individuals with a lack of saliva IgA anti - bodies , or individuals with negative reactions between saliva IgA antibodies and SARS - CoV - 2 , have a high risk of virus infection [ 104 ] , which may also be the reason for the ineffectiveness of severe COVID - 19 vaccine [ 105 ] . There are other routes of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . For example , the gastrointestinal tract may also be an important entrance or interaction site , and the role of the intestinal mucosal immune system as the first line of physical and immune defense is crucial [ 106 ] . In terms of vertical transmission , injecting the SARS - CoV - 2 mRNA vaccine during pregnancy and lactation can induce an anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgA reaction in milk [ 107 ] . The SARS - CoV - 2 - infected mother is in good health and can start or continue breastfeeding [ 95 ] . Some studies even advo - cate that breastfeeding can be maintained during infec - tion , because the SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibody and free secretory component ( fSC ) secreted in breast milk can provide passive immunity for infants [ 108 ] , and pro - tect them from COVID - 19 disease and gastrointestinal - related diseases [ 109 , 110 ] . The most effective measure to control the COVID - 19 pandemic is to vaccinate against SARS - CoV - 2 . The systemic and mucosal IgA responses caused by mRNA vaccination are different , so the effect of preventing subsequent infection is also different . The new SARS - CoV - 2 is constantly changing , and the development of the COVID - 19 vaccine that causes high levels of IgA may reduce human - to - human transmission [ 111 ] . In individuals not previously exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 , vac - cination can induce minimal mucosal SIgA reaction , while in patients with a history of COVID - 19 , SIgA induction after vaccination is more effective [ 112 ] . The widespread use of vaccine preparations is likely to be very useful in determining the individual immune sta - tus of patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 or vaccinated [ 113 ] . Similar studies have found that vaccine adjuvants can also affect the mucosal immunity of the respiratory tract to COVID - 19 by affecting the level of SIgA . Cao et al . believe that the recombinant virus encoding the tri - meric SARS - CoV - 2 spike receptor binding domain can produce a high level of serum anti - SARS - CoV - 2 pseu - dovirus IgA and alveolar lavage fluid RBD - specific SIgA , causing a strong systemic immune response and mucosal neutralizing antibodies , which is expected to be used as a new SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine [ 114 ] . Zheng et al . found that the inhalable nanovaccine with a bionic coronavi - rus structure can bind to the coronavirus by secreting high titer SIgA , thus triggering the mucosal immunity of respiratory tract to COVID - 19 [ 115 ] . In addition , it has been suggested that SIgA in BALF of mice inoculated with live attenuated vaccine d16 developed with SARS - CoV - 2 lacking nsp16 can effectively activate mucosal immunity against SARS - CoV - 2 [ 116 ] . As a potential pro - tective factor , Vitamin A have an effect on SARS - CoV - 2 infection because of the fact that retinoic acid , the active metabolite of vitamin A , can mediate the production of SIgA in the respiratory tract , thus exerting the immune regulation function [ 117 ] . In addition , The supplement of neutrophil elastase inhibitor can promote the develop - ment of mucosal immunity including SIgA [ 118 , 119 ] , by stimulation of B cell activating factor , proliferation induc - ing ligand and IL - 10 of TNF family [ 120 ] , it can help to produce SIgA to prevent infection of pathogens at one or more mucosal sites , which is of great significance for the development of future vaccines . In addition to the beneficial effects of mucosal IgA response in preventing SARS - CoV - 2 infection , the harm - ful effects of IgA in COVID - 19 have also been observed . Especially in the later stages of COVID - 19 , when the virus neutralizing activity of SIgA is lost , the result may be fatal [ 47 , 121 ] . For example , Staats et al . described the correlation between anti SARS - CoV - 2 IgA antibody in the serum of severe COVID - 19 patients and the forma - tion of Neutrophil extracellular traps ( NET ) . They found that subclass IgA antibodies , in particular , are effective activators of neutrophil inflammation and NET forma - tion [ 122 ] . In COVID - 19 , as reported by several research groups , the enhanced formation of NET is associated with fatal outcomes [ 47 , 123 – 125 ] . Therefore , LaSalle et al . hypothesized that in the early stages , IgA induced NET release is beneficial for preventing SARS - CoV - 2 Page 7 of 11 Wang et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 299 entry into the mucosal region , while NET release may be harmful to circulation and promote tissue damage in the later stage [ 48 ] . This provides a breakthrough for the development and application of COVID - 19 therapy based on IgA . SIgA and lung cancer In many human malignancies , such as lung cancer , gas - trointestinal cancer , and hematopoietic cell cancers , studies have confirmed that the expression level of SIgA in patients with disease , is different from that in healthy people [ 126 , 127 ] . Therefore , it has been further pro - posed by early relevant studies that the secreted IgA anti - body is specific for tumor cell clearance , and the relevant immune response can be used for the early detection of cancer [ 128 ] . The IgA antibody isolated or screened from tissues can directly act on tumor cells in vitro or in vivo , so it may be used for tumor treatment [ 129 ] . IgA defi - ciency was significantly associated with cancer risk and cancer mortality [ 50 , 51 ] . It has been found that , com - pared with patients without neoplastic bronchopulmo - nary disease , 30 % of patients with lung cancer , especially those with squamous cell carcinoma , have increased levels of SIgA synthesis in normal bronchial tissues . The determination of SIgA in bronchial mucosa can be regarded as a valuable early diagnostic aid for suspected lung tumors [ 130 , 131 ] . The decreased concentration of SIgA in the airway of lung cancer patients may have adverse effects on airway resistance to bacterial coloniza - tion [ 132 ] . However , the relationship between SIgA and lung can - cer is complex and subject to confusion and reverse cau - sation . On one hand , low SIgA levels were significantly associated with cancer risk and cancer mortality [ 50 , 51 ] , possibly because of reduced immune surveillance of mucosal sites and glands discharging into the mucosa . On the other hand , a high level of SIgA is considered to be an indicator of an existing underlying disease . At some point , immune cells in lung cancer patients interact with tumor cells to cause an immune response that promotes SIgA production . Moreover , since the occurrence of lung cancer is closely linked to environmental factors [ 50 ] , other lung diseases caused by environmental factors may also detect an increase in SIgA . Therefore , the measure - ment of SIgA is unlikely to be clinically significant in the diagnosis of lung malignancy . Atis et al . found that the SIgA level of bronchial lavage fluid in chronic bronchitis , bronchiectasis , and lung cancer groups was no significant difference between the groups . They believed that SIgA was not useful in distinguishing the respiratory epithelial injury or inflammatory reaction of patients with different pulmonary diseases [ 133 ] . At present , SIgA has not been used as a potential breakthrough in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer . However , perhaps , there will be discoveries in the future , which need further research . Conclusion To sum up , SIgA is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various lung diseases and has complex and effective immune functions . With the advancement of this field , SIgA can serve as a potential target for the treatment of lung diseases . However , there have been few previous studies using SIgA as a therapeutic anti - body , and there is a lack of evidence at both preclinical and clinical levels on whether SIgA - related antibodies can provide clinical benefits for patients with airway diseases . Preliminary studies have shown that interven - tion on the level of SIgA in lung diseases can delay the progress of the disease to a certain extent . SIgA can be used as a promising biomarker . Through further explo - ration of its functions , receptor complexes , induced effects and mechanisms , related drugs , and their inter - action , we believe that the mechanisms of SIgA in lung diseases will be gradually clarified , which can provide new ideas and targets for the prevention , treatment and diagnosis of various lung diseases . In addition , with the further development of recombinant antibody produc - tion , complex and polymeric SIgA molecules may be produced on a large scale and with high quality , thus making the widespread application of therapeutic SIgA formulations possible .
