The I / LWEQ Domain in RapGAP3 Required for Posterior Localization in Migrating Cells Mi - Rae Lee , Hyeseon Kim , and Taeck J . Jeon * Cell migration requires a defined cell polarity which is formed by diverse cytoskeletal components differentially localized to the poles of cells to extracellular signals . Rap - GAP3 transiently and rapidly translocates to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation and localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells . Here , we examined localization of truncated RapGAP3 proteins and found that the I / LWEQ domain in the central region of RapGAP3 was sufficient for posterior localization in migrating cells , as opposed to leading - edge localization of full - length Rap - GAP3 . All truncated proteins accumulated at the leading edge of migrating cells exhibited clear translocation to the cell cortex in response to stimulation , whereas proteins localized to the posterior in migrating cells displayed no translocation to the cortex . The I / LWEQ domain appears to passively accumulate at the posterior region in migrating cells due to exclusion from the extended front region in response to chemoattractant stimulation rather than ac - tively being localized to the back of cells . Our results sug - gest that posterior localization of the I / LWEQ domain of RapGAP3 is likely related to F - actin , which has probably different properties compared to newly formed F - actin at the leading edge of migrating cells , at the lateral and post - erior regions of the cell . 1 INTRODUCTION Directional cell movement in response to chemoattractant sti - mulation requires a defined cell polarity in which cytoskeletal components are differentially localized to both poles of cells . At the front of cells , F - actin is polymerized and leads to protrusions of the membrane surface , whereas in a coordinated manner , myosin II assembly occurs at the posterior of cells and me - diates contraction . How these asymmetries are spatially orga - nized and maintained is one of the central questions in under - Department of Biology and Brain Korea 21 - Plus Research Team for Bioactive Control Technology , College of Natural Sciences , Chosun University , Gwangju 501 - 759 , Korea * Correspondence : tjeon @ chosun . ac . kr Received 29 October , 2013 ; revised 29 November , 2013 ; accepted 9 December , 2013 ; published online 6 March , 2014 Keywords : actin cytoskeleton , cell migration , Dictyostelium , I / LWEQ domain , RapGAP standing cell migration ( Lee and Jeon , 2012 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ; Sanchez - Madrid and Serrador , 2009 ) . Cell polarity is formed by a series of signaling molecules , which are differentially activated upon ligand binding to surface receptors . One of the early responses to chemoattractant sti - mulation is the activation of Ras proteins . Activated Ras pro - teins are enriched at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells , where they locally activate signaling molecules ( Lee and Jeon , 2012 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) rapidly accumulate at the leading edge of cells in response to a chemoattractant , whereas PTEN becomes restricted to the sides and the rear , although it is not yet clear what regulates the localization of PI3Ks and PTEN . The reciprocal localization and activation of PI3K and PTEN lead to accumulation of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) trispohsphate ( PIP3 ) at the leading edge , which helps guide the local polymerization of F - actin as well as pseudopod extension at the leading edge of cells possi - bly by recruiting pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain - containing proteins such as PhdA , CRAC , and PKB ( Kortholt and van Haastert , 2008 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . Assembled myosin II is preferentially found in the rear body and along the lateral sides in a decreasing posterior - to - anterior gradient where it is in - volved in uropod retraction . Assembly of myosin II at the back of cells is mainly regulated by several signaling molecules , including PAKa , the cGMP signaling pathway , and the Rap1 signaling pathway ( Kortholt and van Haastert , 2008 ; Lee and Jeon , 2012 ) . The small GTPase Rap1 is involved in the control of diverse cellular processes , including integrin - mediated cell adhesion , cadherin - based cell - cell adhesions , and cell polarity in mamma - lian cells as well as cell adhesion , phagocytosis , and cell migra - tion in Dictyostelium ( Kooistra et al . , 2007 ; Kortholt et al . , 2010 ; Raaijmakers and Bos , 2009 ) . Rap1 is rapidly and transiently activated at the leading edge of cells during cell migration in response to chemoattractant stimulation . Leading - edge activa - tion of Rap1 regulates cell adhesion and helps establish cell polarity by locally modulating myosin II assembly and disas - sembly through the Rap1 / Phg2 signaling pathway ( Cha et al . , 2010 ; Jeon et al . , 2007a ; Kortholt and van Haastert , 2008 ; Lee and Jeon , 2012 ; Mun and Jeon , 2012 ) . Recent reports have demonstrated that spatial and temporal regulation of Rap1 activity by Rap1 GAP proteins is required for proper cell migra - tion . RapGAP1 was identified as a specific GAP protein for Rap1 and is involved in the regulation of Rap1 activity in the anterior of chemotaxing cells to control cell - substratum adhe - sion and myosin II assembly during chemotaxis ( Jeon et al . , MoleculesandCells http : / / molcells . org Established in 1990 Posterior Localization of RapGAP3 Mi - Rae Lee et al . 308 Mol . Cells http : / / molcells . org 2007b ) . RapGAPB and RapGAP3 are required for the correct sorting behavior of different cell types during development ( Jeon et al . , 2009 ; Parkinson et al . , 2009 ) . RapGAP3 mediates deactivation of Rap1 at the late mound stage of development and plays an important role in regulating cell sorting during apical tip formation , when the anterior - posterior axis of the or - ganism is formed , by controlling cell - cell adhesion and cell mi - gration . RapGAP3 transiently and rapidly translocates to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation , which is dependent on F - actin polymerization , and localizes to the lead - ing edge of migrating cells ( Jeon et al . , 2009 ; Lee and Jeon , 2012 ) . To understand the spatial mechanism by which directs locali - zation of RapGAP3 during migration , we examined the subcel - lular localization of truncated RapGAP3 proteins and found that the I / LWEQ domain in the central region of RapGAP3 is re - quired for posterior localization of the protein during cell migra - tion . Here , we present an analysis of the RapGAP3 fragments required for polarized localization of the protein in migrating cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and plasmids Dictyostelium wild - type KAx - 3 cells were cultured axenically in HL5 medium at 22°C . The myosin II , gCA / sGC , and gbp a / b null strains were obtained from the DictyBase Stock Center . The expression plasmids for GFP - coronin and RFP - coronin were described previously ( Cha and Jeon , 2011 ; Jeon et al . , 2007b ) . For expression of GFP - RapGAP3 , the full coding se - quence of rapGAP3 cDNA was generated by RT - PCR , cloned into the Bgl II - Xho I site of pBluescript KS ( - ) , sequenced , and subcloned into the expression vector pEXP - 4 ( + ) containing a GFP fragment ( Jeon et al . , 2009 ) . For expression of the trun - cated RapGAP3 proteins shown in Fig . 1A , the regions in RapGAP3 marked in the diagram ( Fig . 1A ) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the Bgl II - Xho I site of a pEXP - 4 vector containing a GFP fragment . The plasmids were transformed into KAx - 3 cells , and the cells were maintained in 20 μ g / ml of G418 , 50 μ g / ml of hygromycin , or both as required . Chemotaxis and image acquisition The subcellular localization of proteins in response to chemoat - tractant stimulation was examined as described previously ( Cha and Jeon , 2011 ; Jeon et al . , 2007b ) . Vegetative cells were washed twice with Na / K phosphate buffer , resuspended at a density of 5 × 10 6 cells / ml in Na / K phosphate buffer , and pulsed with 30 nM cAMP at 6 - min intervals for 5 h . The pulsed cells were placed on glass - bottomed microwell plates . For imaging chemotaxing cells , a micropipette filled with 150 μ M cAMP was positioned near the cells for stimulation . Images of chemotaxing cells were taken at time - lapse intervals of 6 s for 30 min using an inverted microscope ( IX71 ; Olympus , Japan ) with a camera ( DS - Fi1 ; Nikon , Japan ) . Quantitative analysis of membrane or cortical localization of GFP fusion proteins was performed as described previously ( Jeon et al . , 2007b ; Sasaki et al . , 2004 ) . Aggregation compe - tent cells were allowed to adhere to the plate for 10 min . Cells were then uniformly stimulated with cAMP by quickly pipetting 250 μ l of 150 μ M cAMP into the plate containing cells . Fluores - cence images were taken at time - lapse intervals of 1 sec for 1 min using an inverted microscope . The frames were captured using NIS - elements software ( Nikon ) and analyzed using Im - ageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , USA ) . The intensity of fluorescence at the cell cortex was measured , and the level of cortical GFP was calculated by dividing the intensity at each time point ( Et ) by the intensity before stimulation ( Eo ) . RESULTS Subcellular localization of truncated RapGAP3 fragments in migrating cells RapGAP3 has Rap1 - specific activity and plays an important role in the process of development by regulating cell - cell adhe - sion in multicellular organisms . RapGAP3 is recruited to the cell cortex transiently and rapidly in response to chemoattractant stimulation and localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells ( Jeon et al . , 2009 ) . To further understand the roles of Rap - GAP3 in the regulation of Rap1 activity during migration and development in Dictyostelium , we further investigated the roles of RapGAP3 protein domains in regulating the localization of RapGAP3 during migration . RapGAP3 contains three PH domains at the N - terminal as well as a GAP domain at the C - terminal region ( Fig . 1A ) . In addition , another domain similar to the I / LWEQ domain , known as the F - actin binding domain and originally characterized in the analysis of Talin proteins ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; McCann and Craig , 1997 ) , was found in the central region of RapGAP3 when the amino acid sequence of the central region of RapGAP3 was compared with those of TalinA and TalinB using a se - quence analysis tool ( block maker ) . To investigate the role of each domain in RapGAP3 function during the developmental process and movement , we prepared a series of truncated fragments fused with GFP and analyzed localization of the fragments during chemotaxis moving up a gradient of cAMP chemoattractants ( Fig . 1B ) . Full - length Rap - GAP3 localized to the leading edge of migrating cells as pre - viously reported ( Jeon et al . , 2009 ) . Surprisingly , removing the GAP domain from RapGAP3 resulted in reverse localization of the proteins from the front to the back of cells ( Fig . 1B ) . Cells expressing full - length RapGAP3 ( # 624 ) displayed high accu - mulation of the proteins at the leading edge along with a small amount at the rear and sides of cells . In contrast , cells express - ing the fragments without the GAP domain ( # 628 and # 627 ) exhibited disappearance of the protein at the leading edge and accumulation with a decreasing gradient from the rear to the front of cells . GFP - fusion protein containing the GAP domain alone was found in the cytosol . These results suggest that RapGAP3 contains all of the properties required for localization to each pole in cells , whereas the GAP domain plays a role in localizing proteins to the anterior of cells during migration but is not sufficient for anterior localization . To characterize the region required for posterior localization of the proteins , we further examined the localization of the fragments truncated at the N - terminus . The PH domain alone ( # 626 ) was enriched at the leading edge . Cells expressing the PH domain - truncated protein ( # 636 ) showed high enrichment at the leading edge as well as slight accumulation at the post - erior and sides of cells , similar to that of cells expressing full - length RapGAP3 . This result suggests that the PH domain functions in anterior localization of the protein but not required for localization to the front . It appears that there is an additional region in RapGAP3 , possibly the GAP domain since GAP do - main - deleted fragments were not found in the anterior region , functions in anterior localization during cell migration . Interes - tingly , the I / LWEQ domain without the PH or GAP domain ( # 137 ) was found at the posterior of migrating cells , similar to GAP domain - truncated proteins , indicating that the I / LWEQ Posterior Localization of RapGAP3 Mi - Rae Lee et al . http : / / molcells . org Mol . Cells 309 A C B D domain alone is sufficient for posterior localization . In conclu - sion , our results demonstrate that three regions , the PH , I / LWEQ , and GAP domains , contribute to the localization of RapGAP3 during migration . Further , the PH and GAP domains play roles in the anterior localization of RapGAP3 , whereas the I / LWEQ domain is sufficient for posterior localization . The leading - edge localization of RapGAP3 suggests that the I / LWEQ domain in the full - length RapGAP3 might be masked by other domains and is unlikely to interact with the binding partners . Translocation to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation It has been reported that RapGAP3 transiently and rapidly translocates to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation with a peak of around 10 s ( Jeon et al . , 2009 ) . We examined the translocation of truncated fragments of RapGAP3 to the cell cortex and analyzed translocation kinetics to further understand the factors affecting localization of RapGAP3 . While full - length RapGAP3 ( # 624 ) showed transient translocation to the cell cortex with a peak at around 10 s after stimulation , the translocation of GAP domain - deleted RapGAP3 ( # 627 and # 628 data not shown ) to the cell cortex was not obvious ( Figs . 1C and 1D ) . This result indicates that the GAP domain is required for translocation to the cell cortex in response to chemoattrac - tant stimulation . The PH domain alone ( # 626 ) , which was pre - viously reported to transiently translocate to the cell cortex , exhibited translocation to the cell cortex upon chemoattractant stimulation , and PH domain - deleted fragments containing the GAP domain also showed clear translocation to the cortex . The I / LWEQ domain alone ( # 137 ) showed no clear translocation upon uniform stimulation , as GAP domain - deleted proteins . These results suggest that the PH and GAP domains are involved in the translocation of RapGAP3 to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation , and the GAP domain has a main function in translocation since deletion of the GAP domain but not PH domain prevented translocation of the proteins . More importantly , translocation of the proteins to the cortex upon uniform chemoattractant stimulation is likely to be corre - lated to the spatial localization of the proteins in migrating cells . All proteins accumulated at the leading edge of migrating cells ( # 624 , # 626 , and # 636 ) exhibited clear translocation to the cell cortex in response to uniform chemoattractant stimulation , whe - reas proteins localized to the posterior in migrating cells ( # 628 , # 627 , # 137 ) displayed no translocation to the cortex . Leading - edge localization appears to be correlated to the transient ac - cumulation of proteins by chemoattractant stimulation . These results suggest that leading - edge accumulation of the proteins might be actively induced in response to chemoattractant sti - mulation , whereas posterior localization of proteins might be passively localized by binding to preexisting cytoskeletal com - ponents and excluded from the anterior by actively induced proteins .

Cells http : / / molcells . org A B C D E Localization of the I / LWEQ domain The I / LWEQ domain was originally identified on the basis of sequence similarity in several F - actin binding proteins and has been shown to mediate cytoskeletal localization and F - actin binding ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . Even though the I / LWEQ domain in RapGAP3 is expected to differentially accumulate at the front of migrating cells , in our previous localization study , the I / LWEQ domain of RapGAP3 was found at the rear and was shown to be sufficient for posterior localization . To further understand the mechanism behind the asymmetric distribution of the protein during migra - tion , we examined localization of the I / LWEQ domain of Rap - GAP3 in more detail ( referred to Localization domain , LD ) . In vegetatively growing cells , the LD was localized at the cell cortex . Interestingly , fluorescence of this protein decreased at protruding regions ( Fig . 2A , indicated by arrows ) , where it is known that F - actin is polymerized and F - actin binding proteins usually accumulate ( Kolsch et al . , 2008 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . This result is unexpectedly contrary to the expectation that the I / LWEQ domain might bind to F - actin and become localized to the front of migrating cells . It seems that the LD was excluded by the newly formed F - actin at protruding regions rather than binding to F - actin . However , controversial data in line with the notion that the I / LWEQ domain is excluded from F - actin at pro - truding regions were obtained from the following experiments . It is known that cells form actin foci at their bottoms , which are exhibited by GFP - coronin , a marker protein for newly formed F - actin ( Fig . 2B ) ( Cha and Jeon , 2011 ; Jeon et al . , 2007b ) . GFP - LD was found at foci at the bottom of cells , similar to the actin foci shown by GFP - coronin . In addition , in the presence of La - trunculin A , an inhibitor of F - actin polymerization , most GFP - LD dissociated from the cell cortex , suggesting that the I / LWEQ domain localizes to the cell cortex in an F - actin dependent manner ( Fig . 2C ) . The controversial result that the I / LWEQ domain seems to be excluded from the protruding region by newly formed F - actin along with the occurrence of F - actin de - pendent localization to the cell cortex and actin foci at the bot - tom of cells raises the possibility of two more types of F - actin with different properties . In moving cells , dynamic localization of GFP - LD was investi - gated by changing the location of the pipette filled with che - moattractants ( Fig . 2D ) . The pipette filled with chemoattractants was placed at a position displaying a high level of GFP - LD near the cells ( 0 sec ) . Shortly after positioning of the pipette , the cells produced protrusions toward the pipette while , at the same time , the intensity of the fluorescence decreased at protruding re - gions ( 9 s and 24 s ) . It seems that the amount of GFP - LD at the cortex was rapidly diluted upon extension of the cell cortex toward the pipette , after which the proteins close to the pipette almost disappeared while the other side of cells showed re - verse accumulation of GFP - LD . When the pipette was changed to another position ( 27 s ) , a high level of GFP - LD at the cell cortex close to the pipette ( front of moving cells ) disappeared as previously shown . It appears that GFP - LD passively accu - mulated at the posterior region in migrating cells due to exclu - sion from the extended front region in response to chemoattrac - tant stimulation rather than actively being localized to the back of cells . It is known that F - actin accumulates at each pole of dividing cells , whereas myosin localizes to the cleavage furrow ( Lee and Jeon , 2012 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . The I / LWEQ domain was found at the cleavage furrow as well ( Fig . 2E ) . Colocalization of the I / LWEQ domain with F - actin cytoskeleton To gain insights into the relationship between the I / LWEQ do - main and F - actin , we expressed both GFP - LD and RFP - coronin , which is a marker protein for newly formed F - actin , and then examined their dynamic localization in moving cells and translocation kinetics to the cell cortex in response to chemoat - tractant stimulation simultaneously . Cells expressing GFP - LD Fig . 2 . Analysis of fragment containing the I / LWEQ domain . Cells expressing GFP - 137 plasmid , which contains the I / LWEQ domain , were analyzed .

Posterior Localization of RapGAP3 Mi - Rae Lee et al . http : / / molcells . org Mol . Cells 311 A C B showed foci at the bottom of cells in the previous experiment . To determine if foci found in cells expressing GFP - LD are actin foci or colocalize with those exhibited in cells expressing RFP - coronin , we examined the bottom of cells expressing both GFP - LD and RFP - coronin . As expected , RFP - coronin as well as GFP - LD were found at actin foci at the bottom of cells , and the locations of GFP - LD and RFP - coronin appear to exactly match in the merged images ( Fig . 3A ) . This indicates that the foci shown by GFP - LD are localized to actin foci , and GFP - LD and RFP - coronin colocalize at least at the bottom of cells . Next , we compared the translocation kinetics of both GFP - LD and RFP - coronin to the cortex ( Fig . 3B ) . RFP - coronin exhibited transient translocation to the cell cortex , implying that F - actin newly and transiently formed at the cortex in response to che - moattractant stimulation , but no such translocation to the cortex was observed for GFP - LD . Compared to RFP - coronin , a high level of GFP - LD was found in unstimulated cells , and this high level was continually present at the cortex without alteration of fluorescence intensity upon chemoattractant stimulation . The merged images clearly show the differences in protein levels at the cell cortex . These results suggest that the localization of GFP - LD at the cell cortex is not related to newly formed F - actin . To understand spatial localization of the two proteins , we ex - amined the locations of the proteins in migrating cells ( Fig . 3C ) . In not - yet polarized cells , the two proteins GFP - LD and RFP - coronin were found at partially overlapped regions at the cortex . A small difference in their localization was found at the protrud - ing regions of non - moving cells . RFP - coronin accumulated at protruding regions , indicating F - actin was newly assembled , whereas GFP - LD was present at a relatively low level compa - red with other cell regions . In moving cells , RFP - coronin diffe - rentially localized to the leading edge , in which F - actin is mainly polymerized . In contrast , the GFP - LD level was lower at the front of cells close to the pipette filled with chemoattractants , resulting in a decreasing localization gradient from the posterior to the front of cells . These results suggest that GFP - LD might be excluded from the leading edge of migrating cells by newly formed F - actin . Localization of the I / LWEQ domain in mutants To determine which signaling pathways are involved in the posterior localization of LD in moving cells , we introduced GFP - LD into myoII , gCA / sGC , and gbp a / b null cells and examined localization of the protein in mutants ( Fig . 4 ) . As in wild - type cells , GFP - LD was localized to the posterior region in all mutant cells , suggesting that Myosin II and the cGMP pathway are not involved in localization of GFP - LD in the posterior of cells dur - ing migration . In the presence of LY , which is an inhibitor of PI3Ks , GFP - LD exhibited normal posterior localization as in control cells , suggesting that localization of GFP - LD is inde - pendent of the PI3K pathway . DISCUSSION In this study , we investigated the localization of RapGAP3 frag - ments in migrating cells and found that the I / LWEQ domain in the central region of RapGAP3 , which is known as an actin - binding region and originally identified by comparison with Talin proteins ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) , localized to the posterior , even though full - length RapGAP3 was found at the anterior of cells during migration . The GAP domain was required but not sufficient for localization Fig . 3 . Colocalization of the I / LWEQ do - main with coronin .

The arrow indicates the direction of the cell . Posterior Localization of RapGAP3 Mi - Rae Lee et al . 312 Mol . Cells http : / / molcells . org to the anterior of cells and transient translocation to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation . Cell cortex localization of the I / LWEQ domain appeared to be dependent upon F - actin since the domain dissociated from the cortex after disruption of F - actin in the presence of LatA . On the basis of our results , posterior localization of the I / LWEQ domain is un - likely to be related to the cGMP pathway , myosin II , or PI3K pathway . myosin II null cells and cells with a disrupted cGMP pathway showed posterior localization of the I / LWEQ domain as in wild - type cells . Further , PI3Ks and the products of PI3K PIP3 had no effect on localization of the domain during migra - tion . For a cell to migrate , F - actin is assembled at the front of cells , producing an extension toward chemoattractants through a series of F - actin binding proteins such as coronin , Arp2 / 3 com - plex , and actinin , which are recruited to the leading edge of cells ( Kortholt and van Haastert , 2008 ; Lee and Jeon , 2012 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . In our study , coronin , used as a marker for newly formed F - actin , accumulated at the front of cells along with the bottom as foci . The I / LWEQ domain in RapGAP3 was also found at foci at the bottom of cells , which suggests that , along with its F - actin dependent cell cortex localization , the domain belongs to a family of F - actin binding proteins . However , the I / LWEQ domain was localized to the posterior but not ante - rior region , as with an F - actin binding protein . To explain the result of posterior localization of the I / LWEQ domain as an F - actin binding protein in migrating cells , we pro - pose that there might be two different types of F - actin with dif - ferent binding affinities . One is newly formed F - actin filament at the front of cells while the other is pre - existing F - actin at the rear and lateral sides of cells . Our data suggest that the I / LWEQ domain may bind only to the pre - existing F - actin but not the newly formed F - actin at the front . Recent papers have reported a structural polymorphism in F - actin . F - actin is known to have a variable twist as well as a variable tilt of subunits ( Galkin et al . , 2010 ) . It has been suggested that different actin - binding domains have different affinities for F - actin filaments in functionally distinct regions of the cytoskeleton , based on the studies about localization of the actin - binding domains of Fila - min , which localizes to the rear of polarized cells , and actinin , which is enriched in new pseudopods and at the front of cells ( Washington and Knecht , 2008 ) . Myosin II motor domain loca - lizes to the posterior of cells during migration ( Jeon et al . , 2007a ; Kortholt and van Haastert , 2008 ; Lee and Jeon , 2012 ) . It has been suggested that myosin II preferentially binds to stretched actin filaments in the rear cortex and cleavage fur - rows , and stretching of the actin filament itself increases its affinity for the myosin II motor domain ( Kortholt and van Haa - stert , 2008 ; Uyeda et al . , 2011 ) . The I / LWEQ domain of Rap - GAP3 might have preferential binding affinity for stretched F - actin in the rear cortex and lateral sides of cells as opposed to the cross - linked , newly formed F - actin in the front of cells , help - ing establish cell polarity by locally modulating Rap1 activity . At the leading edge , actin is assembled as a dendritic network forming a lamellipodial shape ( Galkin et al . , 2010 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , at the posterior region , F - actin is oriented parallel to the long axis of migration , which is consistent with the specific localization of the actin - binding proteins Spectrin ( Medina et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 1999 ) , Talins ( Tsujioka et al . , 2012 ; Weber et al . , 2002 ) , myosin II ( Jeon et al . , 2007a ; Meili et al . , 2010 ; Uyeda et al . , 2011 ) , and the I / LWEQ domain of Rap - GAP3 . In conclusion , the polarity of cells is formed by diverse signal - ing molecules localized to the poles of cells in response to extracellular signals . Our results show that one type of protein , RapGAP3 , has the ability to localize to either of the two poles . The I / LWEQ domain , which is known as an F - actin - binding region , in the central region of RapGAP3 was sufficient for posterior localization in migrating cells , whereas the GAP do - main was required for anterior localization . The I / LWEQ domain appears to localize to the cell cortex in an F - actin dependent manner . However , it seems that the I / LWEQ domain was ex - cluded by the newly formed F - actin at protruding regions rather than binding to F - actin . These controversial results raise a pos - sibility that there are two different types of F - actin with different binding affinities . We suggest that the I / LWEQ domain of Rap - GAP3 might bind only to preexisting F - actin at the lateral and posterior regions of the cell but not to newly formed F - actin at the leading edge . Additional studies would be helpful to deter - mine whether or not the I / LWEQ domain binds to newly formed Fig . 4 . Localization of the I / LWEQ domain in mutants . The I / LWEQ domain ( GFP - 137 ) was introduced into myosin II null cells and two cGMP mutants , gCA ( guanylyl cyclase A ) / sGC ( soluble guanylate cyclase ) null cells and cGMP - specific phosphodiesterase null cells , after which localization of the domain in migrating cells was ana - lyzed . In addition , localization of the I / LWEQ domain in wild - type cells pretreated with the inhibitor LY294002 was also analyzed .
