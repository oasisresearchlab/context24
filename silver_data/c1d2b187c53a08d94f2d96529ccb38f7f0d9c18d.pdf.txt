Molecular Biology of the Cell Vol . 11 , 579 – 592 , February 2000 An Endosome - to - Plasma Membrane Pathway Involved in Trafﬁcking of a Mutant Plasma Membrane ATPase in Yeast Wen - jie Luo and Amy Chang * Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx , New York 10461 Submitted June 21 , 1999 ; Revised October 5 , 1999 ; Accepted November 15 , 1999 Monitoring Editor : Suzanne R . Pfeffer The plasma membrane ATPase , encoded by PMA1 , is delivered to the cell surface via the secretory pathway . Previously , we characterized a temperature - sensitive pma1 mutant in which newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 is not delivered to the plasma membrane but is mislocalized instead to the vacuole at 37°C . Several vps mutants , which are defective in vacuolar protein sorting , suppress targeting - defective pma1 by allowing mutant Pma1 to move once again to the plasma membrane . In this study , we have analyzed trafﬁcking in the endosomal system by monitoring the movement of Pma1 - 7 in vps36 , vps1 , and vps8 mutants . Upon induction of expression , mutant Pma1 accu - mulates in the prevacuolar compartment in vps36 cells . After chase , a fraction of newly synthe - sized Pma1 - 7 is delivered to the plasma membrane . In both vps1 and vps8 cells , newly synthesized mutant Pma1 appears in small punctate structures before arrival at the cell surface . Nevertheless , biosynthetic membrane trafﬁc appears to follow different routes in vps8 and vps1 : the vacuolar protein - sorting receptor Vps10p is stable in vps8 but not in vps1 . Furthermore , a defect in endocytic delivery to the vacuole was revealed in vps8 ( and vps36 ) but not vps1 by endocytosis of the bulk membrane marker FM 4 - 64 . Moreover , in vps8 cells , there is defective down - regulation from the cell surface of the mating receptor Ste3 , consistent with persistent receptor recycling from an endosomal compartment to the plasma membrane . These data support a model in which mutant Pma1 is diverted from the Golgi to the surface in vps1 cells . We hypothesize that in vps8 and vps36 , in contrast to vps1 , mutant Pma1 moves to the surface via endosomal intermediates , implicating an endosome - to - surface trafﬁc pathway . INTRODUCTION In mammalian cells , entry of newly synthesized hydrolases into the lysosomal pathway is mediated by a sorting recep - tor at the trans - Golgi complex ( Kornfeld and Mellman , 1989 ) . Analogously , in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Vps10 is a sorting receptor that recycles between the trans - Golgi and the endosome , recognizing a signal within soluble hydro - lases and thereby effecting their delivery to the vacuole ( Marcusson et al . , 1994 ; Cooper and Stevens , 1996 ) . Genetic screens to identify yeast mutants defective in delivery of the vacuolar marker carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) have resulted in . 40 VPS genes required for proper vacuolar protein sorting , revealing the complexity of the vacuole biosynthetic path - way ( Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ; Robinson et al . , 1988 ) . Because biosynthetic trafﬁc to the vacuole or lysosome in - tersects with endocytic trafﬁc at the endosome , a subset of the vps mutants also displays defects in endocytosis ( Davis et al . , 1993 ; Munn and Riezman , 1994 ; Singer - Kruger et al . , 1994 ) . The general organization of the endocytic pathway has been especially well characterized in mammalian cells . Speciﬁcally , extracellular molecules and plasma mem - brane proteins travel through the endocytic pathway to the lysosome via two sequential intermediates , early and late endosomes . Similarly , in yeast , two populations of endosomes have been deﬁned morphologically as well as biochemically ( Singer - Kruger et al . , 1993 ; Hicke et al . , 1997 ; Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) . Nevertheless , a molecular understanding of endosome function remains far from complete ( Gruenberg and Maxﬁeld , 1995 ; Mellman , 1996 ; Riezman et al . , 1997 ) . In mammalian cells , a recycling pathway is well established by which certain internalized proteins are delivered back to the plasma membrane ( Gruenberg and Maxﬁeld , 1995 ; Mellman , 1996 ) . In con - trast , in yeast , the existence of a direct trafﬁc pathway from the endosome to the cell surface has not been estab - lished to date , although a number of recent studies sug - * Corresponding author .

Indeed , two populations of Golgi - derived secretory vesicles have been isolated from yeast ; the ﬁnding that preventing endocytosis results in the accumulation of only one of these populations is consistent with the idea that one of these classes of vesi - cles may derive from endocytic recycling ( Harsay and Bretscher , 1995 ) . We were prompted to examine whether an endosome - to - surface trafﬁc pathway exists in yeast by studies of PMA1 , which encodes the plasma membrane ATPase . Normally , Pma1 reaches the cell surface via the secretory pathway ( Brada and Schekman , 1988 ; Chang and Slay - man , 1991 ) . However , in the temperature - sensitive pma1 - 7 mutant , newly synthesized Pma1 is defective for targeting to the plasma membrane at 37°C and instead is delivered to the vacuole via the endosome ( Chang and Fink , 1995 ; Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . Although the molecular basis for vacuolar delivery of Pma1 - 7 is unknown , we have con - sidered the possibility that there is a post - endoplasmic reticulum quality control mechanism that recognizes and targets mutant Pma1 into the endosomal / vacuolar system ( Chang and Fink , 1995 ; Hong et al . , 1996 ; Li et al . , 1999 ) . Several vps mutants , which are defective in vacuolar pro - tein sorting , have been identiﬁed that cause rerouting of mutant Pma1 to the plasma membrane ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . By disrupting the recycling of a Golgi - based quality control receptor , these vps mutants might allow Pma1 - 7 to travel directly from the Golgi to the cell surface . With this in mind , we have compared trafﬁcking pathways of mu - tant Pma1 in vps1 , vps8 , and vps36 . Remarkably , the data suggest that in vps8 and vps36 cells , Pma1 - 7 moves to the plasma membrane only after it has entered the endosomal system . MATERIALS AND METHODS Media and Strains Standard yeast media and genetic manipulations were as described ( Sherman et al . , 1986 ) . Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method ( Gietz et al . , 1992 ) . Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .

Chang Molecular Biology of the Cell 580 Xho I ( polylinker ) and Bst EII sites , a 1 . 7 - kilobase ( kb ) fragment from the 5 9 region was removed from pAC7 and pAC4 bearing 4 . 5 - kb Hin dIII – Hin dIII pma1 - 7 and PMA1 inserts , respectively ( Chang and Fink , 1995 ) . The fragment was replaced with a 750 - base pair ( bp ) fragment from pFT4 ( provided by C . Slayman , Yale University , New Haven , CT ) , which has a Hin dIII site introduced at 2 27 bp from the start codon , generating pWL1 and pWL2 . A 4 . 2 - kb Hin dIII – Hin dIII fragment bearing the PMA1 coding sequence was excised from pWL1 and pWL2 and placed after the MET25 promoter of FB1521 ( Mumberg et al . , 1994 ) . The 4 . 6 - kb fragments containing MET - pma1 - 7 and MET - PMA1 were excised with the use of Sac I – Xho I polylinker sites and placed into pRS306 , a URA3 - marked YIp , gen - erating pWL5 and pWL6 , respectively . To introduce an HA epitope , the plasmid pXZ28 ( containing PMA1 with an HA epitope intro - duced after the second amino acid ; provided by J . Haber , Brandeis University , Waltham , MA ) was used as a template for PCR . A fragment of 0 . 8 kb was ampliﬁed with the use of the oligonucleotide TCCCCCGGGAGCTAGTTAAAGAAAATC to introduce a Sma I site at 2 67 bp from the start codon and the oligonucleotide CCTTCAC - CTCTCTTAACA . After cutting with Sma I and Bst EII , the PCR frag - ment was used to replace the corresponding fragments in pWL5 and pWL6 to generate pWL9 and pWL10 , respectively . Protein Induction To detect newly synthesized Pma1 , plasmids were used in which HA - tagged mutant or wild - type Pma1 was placed under the control of the MET25 promoter . Cells were grown under repressing condi - tions in minimal medium containing 600 m M methionine . To induce synthesis of Pma1 , cells were washed once with water and resus - pended in methionine - free medium . At the same time , cells were shifted to 37°C . Synthesis of HA - tagged Pma1 was shut off by adding 2 mM methionine alone or in the presence of 100 m g / ml cycloheximide . Figure 1 . Stability of newly synthesized wild - type and mutant Pma1 .

Exponentially growing cells were washed , transferred to methionine - free medium to induce synthesis of epitope - tagged protein , and shifted to 37°C . After 90 min , methionine was added to prevent further Pma1 syn - thesis , and incubation continued for an additional 90 min . Lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot with anti - HA anti - body . Note that newly synthesized wild - type Pma1 is stable , whereas mutant Pma1 is degraded during chase . Figure 2 .

An Endosome - to - Surface Trafﬁc Pathway in Yeast Vol . 11 , February 2000 581 To study Ste3 , cells were grown to midlog phase at 30°C in synthetic complete minus uracil medium with 2 % galactose . Glu - cose ( 3 % ) was added to stop synthesis of Ste3 . For detection of Ste3 by Western blot , anti - Ste3 mAb ( provided by G . Sprague , University of Oregon ) was used . For Ste3 detection by indirect immunoﬂuo - rescence , cells were transformed with a GAL1 - STE3 construct in which a c - myc epitope is fused to the carboxyl terminus of STE3 ( pSL2015 ; provided by N . Davis , Wayne State University ) . Indirect Immunoﬂuorescence , Cell Fractionation , Western Blotting , and Metabolic Labeling For indirect immunoﬂuorescence , cells were spheroplasted with oxalyticase ( Enzogenetics , Corvallis , OR ) and permeabilized with methanol and acetone , as described ( Rose et al . , 1990 ) . Cells were stained with anti - HA ( BABCO , Berkeley , CA ) or anti - myc mAb ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) followed by Cy3 - con - jugated secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) . Pulse - chase experiments were visualized with the use of an Olympus ( Lake Success , NY ) IX70 microscope , and the images were collected digitally ( with the same exposure for each time point within an experiment ) and adjusted at the same settings with Adobe Photoshop 4 . 0 ( Adobe Systems , Mountain View , CA ) . All other ﬂuorescent microscopy experiments were photographed with the use of a Zeiss Axiophot microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) . Cell fractionation on Renograﬁn ( gift of L . Marsh , Albert Einstein College of Medicine ) density gradients was performed essentially as described ( Schandel and Jenness , 1994 ; Jenness et al . , 1997 ) . Har - vested samples were placed on ice in the presence of 10 mM azide . Cell lysates were prepared by vortexing cells with glass beads in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail including 1 mM PMSF ( Chang and Slayman , 1991 ) . After centrifugation at 400 3 g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells , lysate ( 0 . 5 ml ) was mixed with 0 . 5 ml of Renograﬁn - 76 , placed at the bottom of a centrifuge tube , and overlaid with 1 ml of 34 , 30 , 26 , and 22 % Renograﬁn solutions . For pulse - chase experiments , samples from different time points were loaded on gradients after normalization to lysate protein by the Bradford assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) . Gradients were centrifuged in an SW50 . 1 rotor overnight at 150 , 000 3 g at 4°C . Fourteen fractions ( 350 m l ) were collected from the top of each gradient . To prevent Renograﬁn from interfering with subsequent Western blotting , membranes were diluted with Tris - EDTA buffer and pelleted by centrifugation at 100 , 000 3 g for 1 h . Intracellular membranes and plasma membrane were consistently contained in fractions 6 – 7 and 10 – 11 , respectively . Therefore , quantitation of Figure 3 . Localization of newly synthesized mutant Pma1 in vps36 cells . Synthesis of HA - tagged mutant Pma1 was induced at 37°C , followed by a 90 - min chase in the presence of cycloheximide , as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . ( A ) Indirect immuno - ﬂuorescence localization was performed before induction of synthe - sis ( 0 9 ) , after a 90 - min induction ( 90 9 on ) , and after a 90 - min chase in vps36 cells ( WLY156 ) ( 90 9 off ) . Cells were stained with anti - HA antibody followed by Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibody . In vps36 cells , newly synthesized mutant Pma1 is accumulated in the pre - vacuolar compartment after induction ( middle panel , arrowheads ) . A slight increase in staining at the plasma membrane is apparent after chase ( bottom panel , arrows ) . ( B ) Quantitative distribution of newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 in vps36 .

Data are expressed as absolute arbitrary units . W . - j . Luo and A . Chang Molecular Biology of the Cell 582 newly synthesized Pma1 was performed by pooling fractions 1 – 8 and 9 – 14 . Distribution of mutant Pma1 after induction and chase was determined by Western blotting and calculated after subtraction of the background signal obtained at time 0 . For Western blotting of cell lysate , samples were prepared as described previously ( Chang and Slayman , 1991 ) and normalized to lysate protein . After separation by SDS - PAGE , proteins were trans - ferred to nitrocellulose . Anti - HA Western blotting was performed with the use of mAb . Antibodies against Kex2 , Pep12 , and Gas1 were provided by S . Nothwehr ( University of Missouri , Columbus ) , H . Pelham ( Medical Research Council Laboratories , Cambridge , UK ) , and T . Doering ( Washington University , St . Louis , MO ) , respec - tively . Immune complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence de - tection reagents ( ECL Western blotting detection system ; Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) or 125 I - protein A ( Amersham ) . Quantitation of Western blots with the use of 125 I - protein A was performed with the use of a Molecular Dynamics ( Sunnyvale , CA ) phosphorimager . Metabolic labeling was performed with the use of cultures grown to midlog phase in synthetic complete medium without methionine and cysteine . Cells were resuspended at 1 OD 600 / ml , labeled with Expre 35 S 35 S ( New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) ( 2 mCi / 25 OD 600 cells ) for 5 min at room temperature , and chased in the presence of 10 mM methionine and cysteine . At various times during the chase , aliquots were placed on ice in the presence of 10 mM Na azide . Lysates were prepared and resuspended in RIPA buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 150 nM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % NP40 , 1 % deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS ) for immunoprecipitation . RESULTS Inducible Synthesis of Mutant Pma1 To visualize movement of newly synthesized Pma1 , we used constructs in which wild - type PMA1 and mutant pma1 - 7 were tagged with an HA epitope and placed under the control of the MET25 promoter . Although a low level of synthesis is detected under repressing conditions , the West - ern blot in Figure 1 shows a large increase in synthesis of Pma1 upon activation of the MET25 promoter ( by removal of methionine from the medium ) . Quantitation reveals that the level of wild - type Pma1 upon induction is approxi - mately ﬁvefold greater than that of mutant Pma1 , probably because of concurrent degradation of the mutant protein . After stopping synthesis , degradation of newly synthesized mutant Pma1 is readily apparent after 90 min , whereas wild - type Pma1 remains stable ( Figure 1 ) . Previously , we demonstrated that degradation of mutant Pma1 occurs at 37°C upon trafﬁcking of the newly synthe - sized protein to the vacuole ( Chang and Fink , 1995 ; Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . To conﬁrm that epitope - tagged Pma1 behaves in the same manner , indirect immunoﬂuorescence localiza - tion was performed in pep4 cells defective in vacuolar pro - tease activity . Synthesis of HA - tagged Pma1 was induced for 1 h at 37°C , and the cells were then stained with anti - HA antibody . As shown in Figure 2 , newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 is accumulated at the vacuole ( bottom left ) , which is recog - nized as pale regions under phase contrast optics ( bottom right ) . In contrast , staining of cells expressing wild - type Pma1 is at the cell surface ( top ) . Newly Synthesized Mutant Pma1 Reaches the Prevacuolar Compartment of vps36 Cells before Arrival at the Cell Surface Mutant Pma1 is delivered to the cell surface in two class E vps mutants , vps36 and vps27 ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . Class E vps mutants are characterized by defective trafﬁcking from the endosome to the vacuole as well as from the endosome back to the Golgi ( Piper et al . , 1995 ) .

Upon induction , Pma1 - 7 is seen in small punctate structures in vps1 and vps8 cells . At this time in vps1 , surface staining is also apparent ( arrows ) .

At this time in vps1 cells , newly synthesized Pma1 is predominantly in plasma membrane – containing fractions ( lanes 10 and 11 ) ; in vps8 , mutant Pma1 is found in intracellular fractions ( lanes 6 and 7 ) as well as in plasma membrane – containing fractions ( lanes 10 and 11 ) . ( C ) Quantitative distribution of newly synthesized mutant Pma1 in vps1 and vps8 cells . Distribution of Pma1 - 7 in intracellular and plasma membrane fractions was quantitated after a 90 - min induction at 37°C ( on ) and after a 90 - min chase ( off ) , as described in MA - TERIALS AND METHODS . Data from a representative experiment are ex - pressed as absolute arbitrary units . There is a decrease in the total amount of Pma1 after the chase , likely attribut - able to a fraction of newly synthesized Pma1 moving to and being degraded in the vacuole . ( Inset ) Mutant Pma1 levels are expressed as a percentage of the total at each time point . Data are means 6 SD of three or four indepen - dent experiments . Delivery to the plasma membrane is more rapid in vps1 cells than in vps8 cells . An Endosome - to - Surface Trafﬁc Pathway in Yeast Vol . 11 , February 2000 585 mutants , some proteins traversing endocytic and biosyn - thetic pathways are trapped in a novel prevacuolar compart - ment that is visualized as a characteristic large spot next to the vacuole ; on the other hand , newly synthesized CPY is missorted in these cells and travels directly from the Golgi to the cell surface ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ; Piper et al . , 1995 ) . To determine the route by which mutant Pma1 travels to the plasma membrane in the class E vps mutants , the localization of newly synthesized Pma1 was determined by staining with anti - HA antibody . As shown in Figure 3A ( 0 9 , top ) , no staining is seen in vps36 D cells before induction of mutant Pma1 synthesis . After a 90 - min induction period , staining of newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 appears predominantly in large perivacuolar spots ; little cell surface staining is apparent ( Figure 3A , middle , arrowheads ) . Previously , we established that this staining pattern is characteristic of mutant Pma1 accumulating in the prevacuolar compartment ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . The same pattern of Pma1 - 7 accumulation was also seen in vps27 D cells ( data not shown ) . These observa - tions conﬁrm that newly synthesized mutant Pma1 enters the endosomal system in class E vps mutants . In contrast , wild - type Pma1 does not detectably accumulate in the pre - vacuolar compartment or other intracellular compartments ( Figure 4 ) . To determine whether mutant Pma1 can move to the cell surface from the prevacuolar compartment , vps36 D cells were reexamined after an additional 90 - min chase period . Cycloheximide was included during the chase to ensure that no additional Pma1 synthesis could occur . As shown in Figure 3A ( bottom ) , staining of the prevacuolar compart - ment declines after the chase . Much of the decrease is likely due to degradation in the proteolytically active prevacuolar compartment ( Cereghino et al . , 1995 ) . In addition , staining of the plasma membrane appears to increase slightly ( Figure 3A , bottom , arrows ) . A similar pattern was observed in vps27 D cells ( data not shown ) . Quantitation of newly syn - thesized Pma1 - 7 at the cell surface was performed by frac - tionation on Renograﬁn density gradients , which efﬁciently separate plasma membranes from intracellular membranes ( Jenness et al . , 1997 ) ( see below ) . Figure 3B shows the results of such an experiment in which the level of mutant Pma1 in intracellular and plasma membranes in vps36 cells was quantitated after induction and chase and plotted in arbi - trary units . In this experiment , the plasma membrane frac - tion contains 31 % of total Pma1 - 7 present during the induc - tion period ; after chase , the plasma membrane fraction represents 41 % of Pma1 - 7 remaining . In three independent experiments , an ; 9 % fractional increase at the cell surface was observed after chase . Thus , relocation of Pma1 - 7 from the endosomal system to the cell surface appears to occur , albeit inefﬁciently . Cell Surface Delivery of Newly Synthesized Mutant Pma1 in vps1 and vps8 To compare a possible endosome - to - surface route with a Golgi - to - surface route , mutant Pma1 trafﬁcking was fol - lowed in vps1 cells . Vps1 is a dynamin - like protein required for formation of endosome - bound vesicles from the Golgi , and all endosome - directed trafﬁc is diverted to the cell sur - face in vps1 mutants ( Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ) . Figure 5 ( left middle panel ) shows mutant Pma1 localization in vps1 D cells after a 90 - min induction period . Both bright punctate cytoplasmic staining and some surface staining ( arrows ) are apparent . After 90 min of chase ( left bottom panel ) , the punctate staining has disappeared and there is exclusive staining of the cell surface . These observations are consistent with direct transport of newly synthesized mutant Pma1 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane . vps8 mutation also allows Pma1 - 7 to travel to the plasma membrane ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . Because vps8 cells accu - mulate the bulk membrane marker FM 4 - 64 in an endocytic intermediate compartment distinct from the prevacuolar compartment ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ) ( see below ) , it was of interest to examine the pathway to the cell surface taken by Pma1 - 7 in vps8 . As shown in Figure 5 , after induction for 90 min , mutant Pma1 localizes to punctate cytoplasmic struc - tures ( right middle panel ) . After a 90 - min chase , staining is predominantly at the plasma membrane , indicating that newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 moves to the cell surface ( right bottom panel ) . Movement to the plasma membrane in both vps8 and vps1 cells is unaffected by the presence of cyclo - heximide ( data not shown ) . Compared with vps36 , cell sur - face delivery of mutant Pma1 appears more efﬁcient in vps8 and vps1 ( compare bottom panels of Figures 3A and 5 ) . Although the immunoﬂuorescence localization pattern of Pma1 - 7 in vps8 D resembles that in vps1 D cells , careful com - parison suggests slightly more surface staining after induc - tion in vps1 ( Figure 5 , left middle panel , arrows ) . To compare further vps1 and vps8 mutants , cell fractionation was per - formed on Renograﬁn density gradients . Figure 6A shows the distribution of marker proteins after fractionation of wild - type cells on a Renograﬁn gradient . The plasma mem - brane protein Gas1 is found predominantly in fractions 10 and 11 . Newly synthesized wild - type Pma1 is also localized in these fractions . In contrast , Kex2 and Pep12 , membrane proteins that recycle between the Golgi and the endosome ( Wilcox et al . , 1992 ; Becherer et al . , 1996 ) , are predominantly distributed in fractions 5 – 7 . Figure 6B shows the fraction - ation pattern of Pma1 - 7 in vps1 D and vps8 D cells . After 90 min of induction at 37°C in vps1 D cells , the majority of newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 cofractionates with plasma membrane in fractions 10 and 11 . In contrast , in vps8 D cells , a larger fraction of newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 is distributed in intra - cellular membrane fractions . Because there is distinct and consistent separation between intracellular and plasma membranes on Renograﬁn density gradients , fractions 1 – 8 and 9 – 14 were pooled for analysis by quantitative Western blotting . As shown in Figure 6C , after 90 min of induction , Figure 7 . Trafﬁcking of Vps10 in vps1 and vps8 cells . Pulse - chase experiments were used to analyze the stability of Vps10 in wild - type ( L3852 ) , vps8 ( WLX16 - 1A ) , and vps1 ( ACX58 - 3C ) cells . Cells were radiolabeled at room temperature with Expre 35 S 35 S for 5 min and chased for various times . Vps10 was immunoprecipitated and ana - lyzed by SDS - PAGE and ﬂuorography . Newly synthesized Vps10 undergoes degradation in vps1 ( arrow ) but remains stable in vps8 and wild - type cells . W . - j . Luo and A . Chang Molecular Biology of the Cell 586 Figure8 .

Cells were then washed and incubated for an additional 20 or 60 min at 30°C . At 60 min in vps8 ( WLX16 - 1A ) and ypt51 ( WLY65 ) cells , FM 4 - 64 is accumulated in an endocytic intermediate similar to that seen at 20 min in wild - type cells ( L3852 ) . ( B ) FM 4 - 64 endocytosis is delayed in vps8 at a step before the prevacuolar compartment . After labeling for 15 min with FM 4 - 64 , cells were washed , resuspended , and incubated for 1 h at 30°C before visualization and photography . vps8 ( ACY76 ) , vps27 ( ACY33 ) , vps8 vps27 ( WLX20 - 5D ) , and vps1 ( ACX58 - 3C ) cells are shown . The pattern of FM 4 - 64 accumulation in vps8 vps27 double mutants resembles that seen in vps8 cells . An Endosome - to - Surface Trafﬁc Pathway in Yeast Vol . 11 , February 2000 587 . 80 % of mutant Pma1 has reached the cell surface in vps1 , whereas in vps8 , Pma1 - 7 is mostly intracellular . After 90 min of chase , the fraction of mutant Pma1 at the cell surface is increased in vps8 D cells . These data reveal that Pma1 - 7 is delivered to the plasma membrane with different kinetics in vps1 and vps8 . Trafﬁcking of Newly Synthesized Vps10 in vps1 and vps8 Mutants The kinetic differences in cell surface arrival is consistent with the possibility that Pma1 - 7 may take different routes to the plasma membrane in vps1 and vps8 . To examine this possibility in greater detail , trafﬁcking of Vps10 was com - pared in vps1 and vps8 mutants . In wild - type cells , Vps10 , the CPY - sorting receptor , is a stable protein that recycles between the trans - Golgi and the endosomes ( Marcusson et al . , 1994 ; Cooper and Stevens , 1996 ) . Previous reports have shown that recycling of trans - Golgi membrane proteins , in - cluding Vps10 , is disrupted in vps1 mutants ; Vps10 travels instead to the plasma membrane , where it undergoes rapid internalization , delivery to the vacuole , and degradation ( Wilsbach and Payne , 1993 ; Cereghino et al . , 1995 ; Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ) . Figure 7 shows analysis of newly synthesized Vps10 by pulse labeling of cells with [ 35 S ] methionine and [ 35 S ] cysteine followed by chase for various times . In vps1 D cells , Vps10 undergoes proteolytic cleavage at 2 h of chase ( arrow ) , whereas it appears stable in wild - type and vps8 D cells . Similarly , vps1 , but not vps8 , perturbed the stability of the trans - Golgi membrane protein Kex2 ( data not shown ) . These data support the idea that biosynthetic membrane trafﬁc follows different routes in vps8 and vps1 . Endocytosis of the Bulk Membrane Marker FM 4 - 64 Of relevance to deﬁning the trafﬁcking route of Pma1 - 7 is the report that there is defective endocytosis of the ﬂuorescent membrane marker FM 4 - 64 in vps8 ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . To characterize further the endocytic defect in vps8 , a time course of FM 4 - 64 endocytosis was examined . Figure 8A shows that FM 4 - 64 staining occurs predominantly at the plasma membrane when wild - type or vps8 cells are incu - bated with the dye at 0°C , as described previously ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . ( The small bright ﬂuorescent spots that are also seen [ Figure 8A , 0 9 ] are likely endocytic structures formed during photography of the cells . ) After warming the cells to permit endocytosis to proceed , cell surface staining disap - pears at similar rates in both wild - type and vps8 cells , indi - cating that internalization from the cell surface is not af - fected in vps8 . At 20 min after warming , FM 4 - 64 is seen in the cytoplasm as well as in the vacuolar membrane in wild - type and vps8 cells . By 60 min after internalization , FM 4 - 64 has been cleared from the cytoplasm and is exclusively at the vacuole membrane in wild - type cells ( Figure 8A , top right panel ) , whereas much of the internalized dye remains in vesicular intermediates in the cytoplasm of vps8 D cells ( Fig - ure 8A , middle right panel ) . In vps1 cells , FM 4 - 64 labels multiple vacuolar compart - ments ( Figure 8B ) , reﬂecting the fragmented vacuolar mor - phology of the cells ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Nevertheless , no defect in endocytic delivery to the vacuole was detected , in agreement with previous reports ( Wilsbach and Payne , 1993 ; Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ) . FM 4 - 64 endocytosis was also performed in double mu - tants in which vps8 mutation was combined with a class E vps mutation . After 1 h of internalization in vps27 cells , accumulation of FM 4 - 64 in the prevacuolar compartment is seen as a large bright spot next to the vacuole ( Figure 8B ) ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . However , in vps8 vps27 double mu - tants , the pattern of FM 4 - 64 accumulation largely resembles that seen in vps8 cells , with much of the ﬂuorescence signal in vesicular intermediates in the cytoplasm ( Figure 8B ) . The same result was obtained in vps8 vps36 double mutants ( data not shown ) . In contrast , in cells in which the class E vps mutation is combined with vps1 , there is FM 4 - 64 accumu - lation in the prevacuolar compartment but not at an early endocytic step ( data not shown ) . These data indicate that the endocytic defect seen in the vps8 mutant occurs before the prevacuolar compartment of class E vps cells . Consistent with delayed transport through an early endo - cytic intermediate in vps8 , a similar pattern of dye accumu - lation was observed in ypt51 D cells ( Figure 8A , bottom pan - els ) . Ypt51 is a small GTPase and homologue of mammalian Rab5 , and previous work has shown that ypt51 cells accu - mulate internalized a factor in an early endocytic interme - diate ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ; Singer - Kruger et al . , 1994 , 1995 ) . Endocytosis of the Mating Receptor Ste3 To analyze further the endocytic defect of vps8 , the behavior of the cell surface receptor Ste3 was examined . In wild - type cells , Ste3 undergoes constitutive endocytosis and vacuolar degradation ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . To follow the fate of cell surface Ste3 in the absence of new receptor synthesis , STE3 was placed under the control of the GAL1 promoter . Figure 9A shows Western blot analysis of Ste3 stability at various times after glucose addition to repress STE3 expression . In wild - type cells , Ste3 is rapidly degraded upon glucose ad - dition . In contrast , in vps8 , the steady - state level of Ste3 ( at time 0 ) is increased and the rate of Ste3 degradation is decreased ( Figure 9A ) . These results are in agreement with the kinetic delay in delivery to the vacuole observed by FM 4 - 64 endocytosis ( Figure 8 ) . The pep4 mutation stabilizes Ste3 in both wild - type and vps8 cells , indicating that Ste3 degra - dation is due to vacuolar delivery ( Figure 9A ) ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . Indirect immunoﬂuorescence was used to observe Ste3 en - docytosis ( Figure 9B ) . Within 5 min after glucose addition , the distribution of Ste3 in wild - type and vps8 cells appears similar ( Figure 9B , top panels ) . At this time , Ste3 is seen predominantly at the plasma membrane , although some Ste3 is also found in small intracellular spots , likely reﬂecting endocytic intermedi - ates . By 1 h after stopping further receptor synthesis , Ste3 staining in wild - type cells is markedly diminished ; although some punctate staining is visible , staining at the cell surface is not readily apparent . In contrast to that in wild - type cells , plasma membrane Ste3 staining persists in vps8 cells , consistent with receptor recycling to the plasma membrane . DISCUSSION We have analyzed trafﬁcking pathways in the endosomal system by monitoring the movement of newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 . In several vps mutants , a fraction of Pma1 - 7 is rescued from vacuolar degradation and delivered to the cell W . - j . Luo and A . Chang Molecular Biology of the Cell 588 surface . We show that in vps1 cells , newly synthesized mu - tant Pma1 can move to the plasma membrane after appear - ing brieﬂy in punctate intracellular compartment ( s ) ( Figure 5 ) . Consistent with previous reports ( Wilsbach and Payne , 1993 ; Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ) , it seems likely that mutant Pma1 in vps1 cells is routed directly to the plasma membrane from the Golgi complex . In class E vps mutants , newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 accu - mulates ﬁrst in the prevacuolar compartment ( Figure 3 ) . After chase in the presence of cycloheximide to ensure that no further synthesis could occur , a small fraction ( ; 10 % ) of newly synthesized Pma1 - 7 was observed to move to the plasma membrane . These data support a model in which protein trafﬁc can ﬂow from the prevacuolar compartment to the plasma membrane , albeit inefﬁciently . Because there is defective retrograde transport from the prevacuolar com - partment to the Golgi in class E vps mutants ( Piper et al . , 1995 ) , it is unlikely that transport of mutant Pma1 to the cell Figure 9 . Effect of vps8 on endocytosis of Ste3 . Inhibition of vacuolar degradation occurs concomitantly with an increase in cell surface Ste3 in vps8 cells . ( A ) Western blot after preventing new synthesis of Ste3 in wild - type ( ACY72 ) and vps8 ( ACY81 ) cells . To stop new Ste3 synthesis , glucose ( 3 % ) was added to GAL1 - STE3 cells exponentially growing at 30°C in the presence of galactose . At the indicated times after glucose addition , cells were harvested and lysate was prepared for analysis of Ste3 protein level ( top ) . Time 0 represents the steady - state level of Ste3 before the addition of glucose . The bottom panel shows that degradation of Ste3 upon glucose addition is dependent on PEP4 ; stabilization of Ste3 is seen in pep4 ( ACY84 ) and vps8 pep4 ( ACY85 ) cells .

At 5 and 60 min after the addition of glucose ( 3 % ) , cells were ﬁxed , perme - abilized , and stained with anti - myc antibody followed by Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibody .

An Endosome - to - Surface Trafﬁc Pathway in Yeast Vol . 11 , February 2000 589 surface occurs via a Golgi intermediate . It is possible , how - ever , that movement of Pma1 - 7 in these cells from the pre - vacuolar compartment to the surface occurs via an early endosomal intermediate ( Figure 10 ) ( see below ) . Our data have relevance to understanding the mechanism by which misfolded proteins are delivered to the vacuole . A model has been proposed in which vacuolar delivery of misfolded proteins occurs by receptor - mediated transport ( Chang and Fink , 1995 ; Hong et al . , 1996 ; Li et al . , 1999 ) . Our observation that mutant Pma1 enters the endosomal system of class E vps mutants argues that such a quality control receptor probably does not recycle routinely through the prevacuolar compartment . Mutant Pma1 is also routed to the cell surface in vps8 cells ( Figure 6 ) . Our immunoﬂuorescence and cell frac - tionation experiments do not have sufﬁcient resolution to prove unequivocally that Pma1 - 7 enters the endosomal system of vps8 mutants before reaching the surface . Nev - ertheless , several observations prompt us to hypothesize that mutant Pma1 moves to the plasma membrane from an early endosomal compartment in vps8 cells ( Figure 10 ) . First , cell surface arrival of mutant Pma1 occurs more slowly in vps8 compared with vps1 ( Figure 6 ) . Second , pulse - chase analysis shows that Vps10 undergoes rapid degradation in vps1 cells but not in vps8 cells . These data are consistent with vps8 and vps1 mutations having dif - ferent effects on membrane trafﬁc . Third , FM 4 - 64 endo - cytosis experiments indicate defective transport through an early endocytic compartment in vps8 , in contrast to vps1 cells , which have no apparent endocytic defect ( Fig - ure 8 ) . Finally , although plasma membrane internaliza - tion is not impaired ( Figure 8 ) , down - regulation of Ste3 from the cell surface is impaired by vps8 ( Figure 9 ) . These observations suggest persistent receptor recycling to the surface from an endosomal compartment . ( Note that cell surface Ste3 is also increased in the class E vps mutant ren1 / vps2 , in which there is a block in trafﬁc from the prevacuolar compartment to the vacuole [ Davis et al . , 1993 ] . ) Enhanced endosome - to - surface trafﬁcking in vps8 rep - resents the simplest model that can account for all of the observations we have reported . Previous work on Vps8p reveals that it is a large membrane - associated protein containing a RING ﬁnger zinc - binding motif ( Chen and Stevens , 1996 ; Horazdovsky et al . , 1996 ) . A role for Vps8 in the endosomal system is supported by genetic interac - tions between VPS8 and YPT51 ( Horazdovsky et al . , 1996 ) as well as between VPS8 and PEP5 / END1 ( Woolford et al . , 1998 ) . Nevertheless , we cannot formally rule out the pos - sibility that mutant Pma1 moves to the surface directly from the Golgi in vps8 mutants . Similarly , we cannot exclude the possibility that mutant Pma1 undergoes ret - rograde transport from the endosome to the Golgi fol - lowed by delivery to the surface . ( On the other hand , because CPY is missorted in vps8 D cells [ Chen and Stevens , 1996 ; Horazdovsky et al . , 1996 ] , recycling of Vps10 back to the Golgi is likely impaired . ) Our hypothesis is summarized in Figure 10 , in which proposed impaired step ( s ) in transport from the Golgi to the vacuole are labeled with the corresponding vps muta - tions . We propose that in vps8 cells , there is an accumu - lation within early endosomes of proteins entering either from the cell surface ( Ste3 ) or from the biosynthetic path - way ( Vps10 and mutant Pma1 ) . As a consequence , there is increased transport to the cell surface . Because plasma membrane delivery of Pma1 - 7 in class E vps mutants appears less efﬁcient than in vps8 cells , it is possible that movement to the surface from the prevacuolar or late endosome compartment occurs via an early endosome intermediate . In mammalian cells , an endosome - to - surface trafﬁc pathway is taken constitutively by many internalized membrane proteins and lipids . In some cell types , the pathway is specialized for recycling synaptic vesicle com - ponents , antigen presentation , insulin - dependent control of glucose transport , and transcytosis . Indeed , some newly synthesized proteins are normally delivered to the plasma membrane via the endosome ( Futter et al . , 1995 ; Leitinger et al . , 1995 ) . Recent observations suggest that there is possibly analogous endosome - to - surface trafﬁck - ing in yeast . Analysis of the chitin synthase Chs3 has led to the proposal that its distribution between the plasma membrane and the “chitosome , ” an endosomal compart - ment , is regulated by recycling ( Chuang and Schekman , 1996 ; Ziman et al . , 1998 ) . Work on copper entry into the yeast secretory pathway has suggested that copper load - ing of the surface enzyme ceruloplasmin occurs within an endosomal compartment ( Yuan et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , selected plasma membrane proteins may pass through endosomes to fulﬁll speciﬁc processing requirements . Our ﬁnding that mutant Pma1 can move from the endosomal system to the plasma membrane represents a ﬁrst step toward characterizing an endosome - to - surface trafﬁcking path - Figure 10 . Model showing trafﬁcking step ( s ) impaired by vps mu - tations . Proposed impaired step ( s ) in transport from the Golgi to the vacuole are labeled with the corresponding vps mutations . Trans - port from the Golgi to the endosomal system is blocked in vps1 D cells ( Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ) ; endosome - bound trafﬁc , including Pma1 - 7 , is redirected to the surface from the Golgi . In class E vps mutants , such as vps36 and vps27 , there is defective anterograde transport from the prevacuolar compartment to the vacuole as well as defective retrograde transport to the Golgi ( Piper et al . , 1995 ; Nothwehr et al . , 1996 ) . In class E vps mutants , Pma1 - 7 is proposed to travel to the plasma membrane from the prevacuolar compartment via an early endosome . In vps8 cells , there is defective transport from the early endosome to the vacuole ; movement of mutant Pma1 to the plasma membrane in vps8 is proposed to occur as a conse - quence of accumulation in an early endosome .
