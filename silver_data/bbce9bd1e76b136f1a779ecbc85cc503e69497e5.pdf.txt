( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 2 of 25 Abstract Background One of the proposed interventions for mitigating COVID - 19 epidemics , particularly in low - income and crisis - affected settings , is to physically isolate individuals known to be at high risk of severe disease and death due to age or co - morbidities . This intervention , known as ‘shielding’ , could be implemented in various ways . If shielded people are grouped together in residences and isolation is imperfect , any introduction of infections within the shielding group could cause substantial mortality and thus negate the intervention’s benefits . We explored the effectiveness of shielding under various modalities of implementation and considered mitigation measures to reduce its possible harms . Methods We used an individual - based mathematical model to simulate the evolution of a COVID - 19 epidemic in a population of which a fraction above a given age cut - off are relocated to shielding residences , in which they have variable levels of contacts with their original household , the outside world and fellow shielding residents . We set our simulation with the context of an internally displaced persons’ camp in Somaliland , for which we had recently collected data on household demographics and social mixing patterns . We compared an unmitigated epidemic with a shielding intervention accompanied by various measures to reduce the risk of virus introduction and spread within the shielding residences . We did sensitivity analyses to explore parameters such as residence size , reduction in contacts , basic reproduction number , and prior immunity in the population . Results Shielded residences are likely to be breached with infection during the outbreak . Nonetheless , shielding can be effective in preventing COVID - 19 infections in the shielded population . The effectiveness of shielding is mostly affected by the size of the shielded residence , and by the degree by which contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are reduced . Reductions in contacts between shielded individuals could further increase the effectiveness of shielding , but is only effective in larger shielded residences . Large shielded residences increase the risk of infection , unless very large reductions in contacts can be achieved . In epidemics with a lower reproduction number , the effectiveness of shielding could be negative effectiveness . .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 3 of 25 Discussion Shielding could be an effective method to protect the most at - risk individuals . It should be considered where other measures cannot easily be implemented , but with attention to the epidemiological situation . Shielding should only be implemented through small to medium - sized shielding residences , with appropriate mitigation measures such as reduced contact intensity between shielded individuals and self - isolation of cases to prevent subsequent spread . .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 4 of 25 Introduction COVID - 19 epidemics may prove particularly difficult to manage in low - income and crisis - affected settings of the world , where resources to scale up case management are insufficient to meet demand , insufficient public health and laboratory capacity precludes effective use of testing and contact tracing , and socio - economic circumstances ( e . g . overcrowding , inadequate water and sanitation , imperative to generate an income ) make it difficult for populations to adopt and sustain physical distancing 1 , 2 . Over the next years , waning immunity , novel variants , and insufficient vaccine access could expose populations to renewed COVID - 19 waves . This suggests a need to identify options for mitigating epidemics affecting these populations that do not require socially and economically harmful lockdown measures . One such option , known as ‘shielding’ , consists of physically isolating individuals known to be at high risk of developing severe disease and dying if infected with SARS - CoV - 2 2 . This intervention could reduce severe disease and mortality while herd immunity builds up in the low - risk population groups 3 ; it would also lessen health service pressure and enable societies and economies to remain functional . While shielding could best be viewed as a community - led and - designed intervention with no pre - set modalities , we have previously suggested that likely arrangements could include grouping high - risk individuals together into ‘shielding residences’ , particularly where individual shielding within households is impracticable 4 . The number of people shielded together , as well as various other characteristics of the intervention ( e . g . its timing of introduction ; arrangements for infection prevention and control ) could also vary . While compartmental dynamic models indicate that shielding has a substantial potential to reduce mortality and health service pressure 3 , such models do not fully capture the individual - level dynamics of the intervention : in particular , what remains unexplored is the potential harm of inadvertently introducing infection into shielded residences . This harm might or might not be outweighed by the benefit of shielding , compared to no mitigation , and could itself be mitigated through a number of measures , such as not grouping too many high - risk people together ; only shielding people who are not symptomatic ; and supporting people to isolate if they develop symptoms while in a shielding residence . In order to support the design of appropriate , safe shielding interventions , we used mathematical modelling to generate quantitative predictions of the potential benefit and harms of shielding people together under different scenarios of density of shielded residents , timing of shielding implementation with respect to local epidemic onset , compliance with physical isolation and interventions to mitigate the risk of outbreaks within shielding residences . Harm here is defined as infection : it is assumed that .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 5 of 25 high - risk individuals , once infected , would have a high probability of severe disease and death , as described elsewhere 3 , 5 . Methods Model structure We used an individual - based , probabilistic mathematical model ( IBM ) to study the research question . We set our model within the real - life setting of Digaale internally displaced persons’ ( IDP ) camp near Hargeisa , Somaliland , for which data on demographics and other relevant parameters was recently collected . 6 While most IBMs attempt to answer population - level questions ( e . g . the potential impact of an intervention ) , they do so by simulating the trajectories of each individual across different infection and disease states , as a function of various individual - level characteristics . They are particularly useful to simulate small population units ( e . g . households ) in which chance is very influential . In the model , individuals fall within (cid:0) age groups with relative proportions (cid:2) (cid:0) ( where (cid:3) is a given age group ) . Individuals live in any of (cid:4) households of mean size (cid:5) (cid:2) ( we use the empirically measured (cid:4) and household sizes (cid:6) (cid:2) ) . The population of size (cid:6) is seeded with a single SARS - CoV - 2 infection at the start of the simulation . The IBM is ran for a total of 365 days or until the outbreak naturally dies out . Given its short timeframe , births , deaths , ageing and migration are omitted from the model . The endpoint of interest is infection ( i . e . the effectiveness of shielding relates to its ability to reduce infection risk among high - risk individuals ) : as such , the clinical outcome and treatment status of cases are not included in this model . States and transitions At any time (cid:7) , individualsare within one of the following epidemiological states : (cid:8) ( susceptible ) , (cid:9) ( pre - infectious ) , (cid:10) (cid:3) ( infectious but pre - symptomatic ) , (cid:10) (cid:4) ( infectious and symptomatic ) , (cid:10) (cid:5) ( infectious and asymptomatic throughout the infection ) , or (cid:11) ( removed : recovered and assumed to be immune or deceased ) . The age - specific probability of becoming a symptomatic case is (cid:12) (cid:0) . Over any (cid:13)(cid:7) time unit , any given individual (cid:14) has the following binomial probabilities of transitioning to a subsequent state : (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:8) (cid:6) (cid:18) (cid:9) (cid:6) (cid:19) Binomial(cid:28)1 , 1 (cid:31) (cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:0) , (cid:3) , (cid:4) ! .

The basic reproduction number (cid:11) (cid:21) is defined as the average number of secondary infections generated by a typical infected individual in a fully susceptible population and may be computed as the absolute value of the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix ( NGM ) of the corresponding compartmental model structure , defined as (cid:6)56 (cid:13)(cid:0) ’ ( 2 (cid:13)(cid:0) # (cid:12) (cid:13) (cid:28) " (cid:3) + " (cid:4) ! + (cid:28)1 (cid:31) (cid:12) (cid:13) ! , (cid:28) " (cid:5) ! $ where accents indicate the expected ( average ) values . Lastly , ( is the ratio of this eigenvalue and the (cid:11) (cid:21) value assumed in the simulation ( see below ) . (cid:11) (cid:21) values were validated by running multiple model iterations with different seeds to start the random number generator , and by calculating the average number of secondary cases derived from all infectious individuals who completed their period of infectiousness in the first 30 days of the simulation . Model simulations start at day 1 , when one randomly selected individual living in the camp is made infectious . Shielding and related interventions Shielding is introduced when the prevalence of symptomatic cases in the population reaches 5 per 1000 individuals , by relocating a proportion (cid:2) (cid:22) of high - risk individuals within (cid:4) ( for simplicity , high risk is defined based solely on an age cut - off , i . e . ≥ 60 years old ) into 5 shielded residences containing a variable maximum number (cid:6) (cid:22) of high - risk residents . While shielded , high - risk residents’ contact with other people remains structured as above , but is reduced or increased to varying extents as follows : (cid:0) contact with unshielded members of the household of origin is reduced by a factor 7 (cid:23) ; (cid:0) contact with other unshielded people is reduced by a factor 7 (cid:24) ; (cid:0) contact with other shielded individuals within 8 is assumed to occur by random mixing , with 3 as the baseline per - capita rate , either reduced ( if physical distancing and improved hygiene are also maintained within 8 ) or increased ( if , vice versa , 8 is overcrowded and unsanitary ) by a factor 9 (cid:23) . .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 12 of 25 Results Risk of virus introduction into shielded residences Generally , we project a high probability that shielding residences are breached during the outbreak , i . e . at least one resident is newly infected when shielded ( Figure 1 ) . This risk increases proportionally to the shielded residence size . Assuming an 80 % reduction in contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals , there would be a 38 % ( 29 - 49 ) risk of any shielded residence of size two being breached , whereas this risk increases proportionally to the shielded residence size . Breaching risk is moderated by the effectiveness of shielding : the extent to which contacts between shielded and unshielded contacts are reduced . Very effective implementations of shielding , where contacts with unshielded individuals are reduced by 100 % and onward transmission can only result from pre - shielding infections , protect nearly all small shielded residences , but cannot prevent infections to occur in larger shielded residences . Additional mitigation measures that aim to screen individuals for infection before they were shielded were not effective in reducing the risk that shielded residences are shielded . In none of the scenarios considered was the proportion of breached shielded residences significantly different when either syndromic screening or testing was implemented prior to screening . There was only one scenario ( with (cid:11) (cid:21) of 1 . 5 , 25 % prior immunity , 20 % of the high - risk population that was shielded , and a shielded residence size of 2 ) where testing but not syndromic screening significantly increased the mean number of days until shielded residences were shielded by 3 days ( 0 - 12 ) .

In all scenarios shown , (cid:14) (cid:8) was 2 . 5 and 0 % of the population were immune at the start of the simulation . Effectiveness of shielding against individual risk of infection High - risk individuals who are not shielded experience similar infection rates as unshielded low - risk individuals ( Figure 2 ) over time . High - risk individuals who are shielded can have substantially lower risks of infection , depending on the implementation of shielding . The risk of infection for shielded individuals increases with the size of the shielded residences , and is mitigated by the degree by which contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are reduced . Shielding has no substantial effect on infection risk of unshielded individuals , regardless of the proportion of high - risk individuals that is shielded ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . Shielding does not substantially alter the timing of outbreaks within the shielded population , and has no substantial impact on infections in the unshielded low - risk population . Individuals who are shielded in large shielded residences could experience a higher risk of infection compared to unshielded individuals of the same age , even with relatively effective implementations of shielding .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 14 of 25 Figure 3 shows the effectiveness of shielding to prevent infections in high - risk individuals when compared to unmitigated epidemics for a range of different shielding implementations . Effectiveness is calculated as the relative reduction in the cumulative number of infections during the entire modelled outbreak . Even if shielding would not be effective in reducing contacts with unshielded individuals at all , rehousing individuals in shielded residences of size 2 ( which is half the median household size ) would result in a 10 % ( 3 to 17 ) reduction of cases . As the size of the shielded residence increases , higher reductions in contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are needed to achieve substantial reductions in infection risk , whereas even a 100 % reduction in contacts is insufficient to reach any substantial reduction ( 2 % ; - 9 to 25 ) in the absence of other mitigation measures for shielded residences of size 16 . For less effective implementations of shielding , rehousing high - risk individuals in residences of size 16 may even increase their risk of infection : the effectiveness of shielding is - 6 % ( - 13 to - 2 ) when contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are reduced by 60 % . As the size of the shielded residence increases , the relative change in contacts between shielded individuals living in the same residence , relative to the average contact intensity between individuals within a household , becomes more important for infection control . In shielded residences of size 8 , reducing contacts within the shielded compartment by 40 % ( in addition to the 80 % reduction of contacts with unshielded individuals ) may increase the effectiveness of shielding from 12 % ( 3 to 22 ) to 27 % ( 16 to 38 ) . For a residence of size 16 , a reduction of at least 60 % would be required in order for shielding to have a beneficial effect of 12 % ( 3 to 24 ) . Contact intensity between shielded individuals only marginally affects the risk when individuals are shielded in smaller residences ( 2 to 4 individuals ) . If relative contact intensity between shielded individuals were to increase rather than decrease , the benefit of shielding in shielding residences of moderate sizes decreases , though this extent is mitigated by residence size . Self - isolation of symptomatic cases who are shielded could further increase the effectiveness of shielding , though it is less effective than an overall reduction in contact intensity within the shielded residence . The largest effects are present in shielded residences of size 8 , whereas effects are small for smaller and larger residences . The impact of other mitigation on the effectiveness of shielding is small . If symptomatic cases would leave the shielded residence on the first day they develop symptoms , effectiveness increases from 39 % ( 27 to 50 ) under the baseline strategy to 42 % ( 31 to 54 ) when shielded residences are of size 4 , and from 12 % ( 3 to 22 ) to 20 % ( 9 to 33 ) when shielded residences are of size 8 , but any benefit disappears if there is a delay of at least two days . Testing for infection or syndromic screening prior to shielding is not effective in reducing infection risk in the shielded population . .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 16 of 25 Sensitivity to (cid:0) (cid:24) and pre - existing immunity Our main analysis has assumed an (cid:11) (cid:21) of 2 . 5 , but we assessed the sensitivity of this assumption to our results in scenarios where (cid:11) (cid:21) was 1 . 5 , 3 . 5 , or 5 . In addition , whereas our main analysis assumed that all individuals in the population were susceptible , we assessed the sensitivity of our results to scenarios where 25 % or 50 % of the population was immune to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Table 2 lists the median attack rates in unmitigated outbreaks under each scenario . Table 2 . Infection attack rates in high - risk individuals , by (cid:14) (cid:8) and prior immunity .

Under all levels of (cid:11) (cid:21) considered , there is a high risk that shielded residences of size 16 would be breached , with 71 % ( 46 - 93 ) of residences breached when contacts with unshielded individuals are reduced by 100 % and (cid:11) (cid:21) is only 1 . 5 . Only residences of size 2 result in a low number of breached residences in all scenarios . High effectiveness of shielding ( ≥ 80 % reduction in contacts with unshielded individuals ) and small shielded residences ( 2 to 4 people ) are needed to prevent a substantial number of residences being breached for outbreaks with a high (cid:11) (cid:21) ( ≥ 3 . 5 ) . Regardless of the (cid:11) (cid:21) , unshielded low - and high - risk individuals experience similar attack rates over time ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . A large shielded residence results in high cumulative attack rates in all scenarios considered . In scenarios with a large shielded residence size ( 16 ) and low (cid:11) (cid:21) , the cumulative attack rate is substantially higher in shielded compared to unshielded individuals . The cumulative attack rates in all groups is not affected by the proportion of high - risk individuals that are shielded . A shielded residence size of 2 did never result in a negative impact of shielding when compared to unmitigated scenarios in any of the scenarios considered . Scenarios with low effective reproductive numbers , either through a low initial (cid:11) (cid:21) or a higher (cid:11) (cid:21) with a substantial proportion of the population already immune , could result in a negative impact of shielding . Without any pre - existing immunity in the population and an (cid:11) (cid:21) of 1 . 5 , a shielded residence size of 16 would result in a negative impact in all .

While the maximum effectiveness of shielding compared to unmitigated scenarios decreases as the proportion of the population that is already immune increases , more leaky implementations of shielding ( a lower reduction in contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals ) increase in their effectiveness as the proportion that is already immune increases . For instance , when (cid:11) (cid:21) is 5 , shielding in residences of size 2 with 100 % reduction in contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals prevents 60 % ( 45 - 75 ) of cases with 0 % pre - existing immunity , 60 % ( 44 - 74 ) with 25 % pre - existing immunity , and 46 % ( 25 - 66 ) with 50 % pre - existing immunity . Shielding in residences of size 2 with only 40 % reduction in contacts prevents 7 % ( 3 - 12 ) of cases with 0 % pre - existing immunity , 14 % ( 7 - 23 ) with 25 % pre - existing immunity , and 21 % ( 8 - 33 ) with 50 % pre - existing immunity . .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 18 of 25 Discussion Main findings The potentially devastating impact of COVID - 19 on humanitarian settings has been highlighted many times 15 – 18 , but few empirical and modelling studies have focussed on these settings due to a lack of available data 19 . To our knowledge , our study is the first modelling study to specifically look at shielding as a COVID - 19 mitigation option for IDPs or camp - like settings . Our results could be extended to other low resource settings with low vaccine coverage , where large scaled lockdowns cannot be sustained long term . We found that shielding can be an effective measure to protect individuals at high risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID - 19 using demographic and contact data from Digaale IDP camp , though there is a risk of harm in specific scenarios . The impact of shielding largely depends on how effectively it is implemented , requiring stringent isolation of shielded people , and high uptake ( coverage ) for substantial population impact . Specifically , the effectiveness of shielding mostly depends on two factors , i . the total number of individuals who are shielded together , and ii . the reduction in contact between shielded and unshielded individuals . This is not surprising , as the effectiveness of public health and social measures largely depends on changing existing social contact structures , which are impacted by these two factors . Generally , our model projects that smaller shielding residences would be considerably more effective than larger ones . They are less likely to be breached , and there is only limited opportunity for onward transmission when breached . These small - scale implementations of shielding may also be more acceptable to implement : shielding was seen as an acceptable method to protect the most vulnerable in Sudan , though extra - household shielding arrangements were generally viewed to be socially unacceptable 20 . Shielding within or close to the old household may result in more intense care by low - risk individuals to occur , where contact rates with unshielded individuals in general cannot be reduced by high levels . Large shielded residences should be avoided , as they were not effective in all scenarios unless a very stringent form of shielding is implemented , with none or very little contact between shielded and unshielded individuals and among shielded individuals within the same shielding residence . This would be a potentially daunting standard to achieve in real - life application , as has been shown in the control of COVID - 19 in nursing homes . 21 .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 19 of 25 In settings where it is not feasible to implement small - group shielding strategies , shielding in medium sized shielding residences could be an alternative . However , shielding in medium sized shielding residences would highly benefit from further mitigation measures , such as a reduction in contact intensity between shielded individuals living in the same shielding residence , and self - isolation or quarantine of shielded cases once any resident becomes symptomatic . Contact intensity may well be lower when individuals from different households are housed together , compared to when individuals who are shielded together only belong from the same household . If self - isolation in a given shielding residence is unfeasible , syndromic screening may be an effective alternative where symptomatic individuals exit the shielding residence as soon as possible after symptom onset . However , as COVID - 19 symptoms are highly non - specific 22 , this would ideally be combined with testing strategies , and symptomatic individuals would ideally be quarantined . Our model predicts little effect of other mitigation measures considered , such as testing individuals before they are shielded , or dismantling the shielding residence once a case arises . Both measures are most likely to detect current infections , but would miss any individuals already infected but not yet infectious . Continuous testing may be an effective alternative 23 , but was not considered in our analysis , as ( asymptomatic ) testing capacity may be limited in humanitarian settings . When (cid:11) is low , either as a result of a low initial (cid:11) (cid:21) , or pre - existing immunity in the population through natural immunity or vaccination , shielding individuals in medium - to large groups could increase their infection risk and result in harm . The epidemiological situation should be considered to assess the appropriateness of shielding in any setting . Limitations There are several limitations to this study . Although we were able to use baseline empirical contact - data , these contact patterns could be further altered if shielding would be implemented and contact dynamics change . We only considered Digaale IDP camp , as to our knowledge it is the only humanitarian setting for which detailed contact and demographic data is available . Social contacts are context specific 24 , and Digaale is a relatively small - scale peri - urban settlement , which may not be representative of other low - resource or crisis - affected settings . Our model did not include an additional force of infection from outside the camp , beyond the first seeding event . Fewer than 2 % of all contacts were reported to be made outside of the camp in the contact data , so the relative impact of additional transmission from outside the camp in the unshielded population is expected to be small once transmission has already been established . .

( 2020 ) Shielding for COVID - 19 Page 20 of 25 We did not estimate the number of cases and deaths that would be expected after infection , though these are proportional to the number of infections . We focussed our analysis on the impact of shielding high - risk individuals , but only assumed individuals aged 60 + years old to be at high - risk . Although the age - risk profile may well be different in low - resource settings compared to stable settings 25 , empirical estimates are missing , and similar levels of effectiveness could be expected with broader definitions of high - risk groups . We did not consider simultaneous implementations of other measures , such as physical distancing in the general population . In reality , shielding would most likely be implemented in addition to other non - pharmaceutical interventions . We previously found that a combination of shielding , self - isolation , and moderate social distancing may be an effective and feasible strategy for low - income countries 3 . Whereas large - scaled lockdowns could temporarily be effective in delaying epidemic peaks 3 , 26 , these cannot sustainably be implemented in most humanitarian responses and low - income countries . Conclusions and recommendations COVID - 19 epidemics could be difficult to control in low - resource settings , including humanitarian settings , where residents live in crowded spaces , little healthcare capacity is available , and stringent social distancing measures cannot sustainably be implemented . Shielding could be an effective alternative to protect high - risk individuals , when it is not possible to implement more stringent factors such as lockdowns . Where possible , shielding should be implemented through small to medium - sized shielding residences , with appropriate mitigation measures such as reduced contact intensity between shielded individuals and self - isolation of cases to prevent subsequent spread . Shielding should not be implemented if only large - sized shielding residences are available , as this could result in an increased infection risk for high - risk individuals and do more harm than good .

Cumulative infection risk by shielded status , stratified by shielded residence size ( in facet columns ) and (cid:11) (cid:21) ( in facet rows ) . Panel A shows scenarios where 20 % of the high - risk population was shielded , while panel B shows scenarios where 80 % of the high - risk population was shielded . In each scenario , lines represent the median attack rate across 1000 model runs at each timepoint , whereas corresponding 95 % uncertainty intervals are shown by shaded areas of the same colour . Estimates for ( unshielded ) low - risk individuals are shown in dark - green and a dashed line . Unshielded high - risk individuals are shown in light - green , while shielded high - risk individuals are shown in blue . In all scenarios shown , 0 % of the population were immune at the start of the simulation , and contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are reduced by 80 % . .

Relative reduction in cumulative infection risk in shielded high - risk individuals compared to no - shielding , by shielded residence size ( shaded by colour ) , (cid:14) (cid:8) ( in facet columns ) , and the proportion immune at the start of the simulation ( in facet rows ) . Points represent median estimates over 1000 model runs , while bars represent their 95 % uncertainty intervals . In all scenarios shown , contacts between shielded individuals within the same shielded residence remain unchanged , symptomatic individuals who are shielded do not reduce their effective contacts , and no other mitigation measures are implemented . Contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are reduced by the levels on the y - axis . Estimates to the left of the thick vertical grey line correspond to an increase in infection risk after shielding compared to no shielding . In all scenarios , 100 % of high - risk individuals were shielded . There were not enough model iterations with large enough outbreaks to implement shielding in scenarios with an (cid:14) (cid:8) of 1 . 5 or 2 . 5 and 50 % prior immunity , so estimates are not available for these scenarios . .
