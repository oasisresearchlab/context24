Galactose - induced Cse4 - GFP expression resulted in fluorescent protein incorporation at the centromeres ( Figure 2B ) . Asynchronous cells were then shifted to glucose medium , and telophase cells with Cse4 - GFP labeled centromeres were followed in the next cell cycle ( Figure 2B ) . Within 10 min of bud emergence , mother cell Cse4 - GFP fluorescence could not be detected at kinetochores over background fluorescence ( Figure 2B ; 19 / 22 cells ) . The unbudded daughter cell retained Cse4 - GFP fluorescence until bud emergence , when it lost fluorescence signal ( Figure 2B ; 6 / 6 cells ) . The advanced cell cycle timing of mother relative to daughter cells illustrates that loss of fluorescence at bud emergence was not the result of photobleaching during image ac - quisition . Rather , fluorescence did not significantly de - crease until bud emergence from these daughter cells . Fluorescence loss in the mother and daughter cells at approximatelythetimeofbud emergenceandearlyDNA replication indicated that Cse4 - GFP at the original cen - tromere exchanges with unlabeled Cse4p .

The predicted loss in kinetochore function during Cse4p exchange provides a model for microtubule detachment during a specific phase of the cell cycle : DNA replication .

Salmon , and Kerry Bloom Supplemental Experimental Procedures Simulation Methods The simulation of Cse4 - GFP FRAP was allowed to run for 350 s ( 700 time steps ) prior to the bleaching event ( t (cid:1) 0 min ) . At time 0 min , an array was generated with 32 elements , one element correspond - ing to each simulated kinetochore microtubule , to record the bleach statusofeachkinetochore . Ifthelengthofakinetochoremicrotubule attached to the left spindle pole body ( at 0 min ) was less than or equal to half of the total spindle length , or if the length of a kineto - chore microtubule attached to the right spindle pole body was greater than or equal to half of the spindle length , the bleach status array element corresponding to that kinetochore microtubule was assigned as 0 , indicating that the kinetochore Cse4 - GFP was bleached . All other kMTs were assigned as 1 in the bleach status array , indicating that the kinetochore Cse4 - GFP was not bleached . This effectively implemented the experimental procedure in which one half of the spindle is bleached at an instant in time . Thebleachstatusarraywasthenstoredandremainedunchanged for the duration of the simulation . Simulated microtubule dynamics were allowed to continue unaffected for an additional 6 . 7 min ( 800 time steps ) after the bleach event . Simulated fluorescence images were generated as previously described [ S1 ] , with the following exception : Prior to generating simulated images of the kinetochore position data array after the bleach event had taken place , each element in the bleach status array was multiplied by its correspond - ing element in the kinetochore position data array . In this way , all bleached Cse4 - GFP kinetochores were assigned 0 values in the kinetochore position array , rendering bleached kinetochores nonfluo - rescentduring the image simulation process . Simulated image anal - ysis was completed as previously described [ S1 ] . The total fluores - cence in a given spindle half was calculated and monitored for the duration of the simulation . The simulation explicitly included the experimentally measured noise levels in generating the simulated Cse4 - GFP images . As was observed experimentally , the model does not account for Cse4 - GFP turnover on the kinetochore or diffusion of free ( un - bleached ) Cse4 - GFP into or out of the bleached spindle half .
