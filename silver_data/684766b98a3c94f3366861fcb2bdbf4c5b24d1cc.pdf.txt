The biochip was easy and cheap to manufacture and enabled positioning in a wet environment . It allowed the application of total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy at the dorsal cell membrane , which is not adhering to a support . Speciﬁcally , the chip enabled TIRF microscopy at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells . Thereby , the device allowed us for the ﬁrst time to monitor individual fusion events of GPI – GFP bearing vesicles at the apical membrane in live Madin – Darby canine kidney II ( MDCK II ) cells . Moreover , a mapping of fusion sites became feasible and revealed that the whole apical membrane is fusion competent . In total , the biochip offers an all - in - one solution for apical TIRF microscopy and contributes a novel tool to study trafﬁcking processes close to the apical plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells . Introduction Monitoring fusion events of vesicles bearing a protein of interest tagged with a ﬂuorescent protein is possible by live cell microscopy if sufﬁcient resolution in time and space is provided . 1 Ideally , only signal at or close to the plasma membrane is detected in order to increase the signal to noise ratio . 2 – 4 These requirements are best fulﬁlled by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) micros - copy . In this method a (cid:1) 100 nm thick region is excited by an evanescent ﬁeld generated by a laser beam totally internally reﬂected at an interface between two materials with different refractive indices . In order to achieve total internal reﬂection , the laser beam needs to enter from the higher refractive index side . 4 This condition is naturally fulﬁlled where the ventral membrane of a cell ( low refractive index side ) is attached to a glass substrate ( high refractive index side ) . For the non - attached dorsal membrane TIRF microscopy is impossible unless a strategy is devised that brings this membrane within the evanescent ﬁeld excitation . A case of special interest are polarized epithelial cells that line virtually all cavities of the human body and function as selective barrier layer . 5 Their plasma membrane is separated by the tight junctions into two compartments—the apical and the basolateral plasma membrane . 6 – 8 The apical membrane faces the outside or the lumen and is equivalent to the dorsal membrane . The polarized architecture is setup and maintained by an adapted vesicular trafﬁcking system that enables to sort and deliver proteins exclusively to the apical or to the basolateral plasma membrane . 7 The fusion of vesicles with the target plasma membrane represents the concluding step in the vesicular traf - ﬁcking route . Imaging of fusion events in live cells has contrib - uted to the understanding of vesicular trafﬁcking by demonstrating the existence of different phases during the fusion process ( tethering , rise phase and diffusive spreading of the vesicular cargo ) , 1 , 9 , 10 and enabling to localize the fusion sites . 10 , 11 However , in polarized cells vesicle fusion events have been difﬁcult to explore , especially at the apical plasma membrane detailed information is lacking . 12 – 15 Recently the feasibility of TIRF microscopy at the apical membrane has been demonstrated by placing an epithelial cell monolayer , grown on a semipermeable membrane , upside down on a glass slide . 16 – 18 In these studies , an additional weight has been applied to force the cells down with their apical membrane into the region of the evanescent wave . In the present paper we imple - mented a device for adjusting the position of the cell monolayer and therefore ensure controllable approaching to the glass surface . To this end we developed a biochip entirely made of PDMS and manufactured by standard microstructuring technology . The chip offers an all - in - one solution , where the cells can directly be grown to polarize on the device and then being appropriately placed by the integrated micro - positioning system in order to perform apical TIRF microscopy . The chip enabled us for the ﬁrst time to record individual vesicle fusion events at the apical membrane of live cells .

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue Biochip manufacturing Part 1 of the chip consisted of two layers of poly ( dimethylsi - loxane ) ( PDMS ; RTV 615 , Momentive , Albany , NY ) as outlined in Fig . S1† and was manufactured using standard soft - lithog - raphy techniques . 19 The individual layers were manufactured by pouring ( part 1a ) or by spin - coating at 3500 rpm ( part 1b ) PDMS pre - polymer onto masters . The masters were polished silicon wafers ( Siltronic , Munich , Germany ) with features of photoresist on top . The photoresist features ( 200 m m height ) were manu - factured by standard photolithography 20 using photoresists of the SU - 8 series ( MicroChem , Newton , MA ) . Masters were treated by exposure to the vapour of trimethylchlorosilane in order to prevent irreversible adhesion of the PDMS layer . After curing the PDMS layers 1a and 1b for 30 min at 80 (cid:3) C , layer 1a was cut to size , access holes to the actuator channel system were punched , and layer 1a was placed on layer 1b . A second curing step at 90 (cid:3) C for 12 h ensured irreversible bonding of the two PDMS layers , thereby forming part 1 of the biochip . The remaining parts of the biochip were manufactured by pouring a 5 mm ( part 2 ) or 4 . 5 mm ( part 3 ) thick layer of PDMS into a 145 mm Petri dish with a silicon wafer at the bottom . For part 3 , the silicon wafer contained photoresist features in order to create 100 m m deep indentations for ﬂuid drainage . After curing at 90 (cid:3) C for 12 h , the parts were cut to shape with a scalpel . For bonding of all parts , the appropriate surfaces ( see Fig . S1† ) were air plasma treated ( 20 W , 300 mTorr , 100 s ) and then pressed together . During this process the actuator channels were pressurized ensuring that only the middle part of the membrane covering the actuator channels bonded to part 3 . Reﬂection interference contrast ( RIC ) microscopy First , monodisperse polystyrene – divinylbenzene beads with 9 . 75 m m diameter ( PolySciences , Eppelheim , Germany ) were immo - bilized at the cell growth area of the chip by incubating the plasma - activated PDMS biochip surface with the beads dis - solved in water overnight ( see Fig . S2A† ) . For measuring the pressure – distance behaviour of the chip with RIC microscopy , the actuator channels were ﬁlled with water and the chip was placed on a glass slide with a drop of water on it . A manually height - adjustable water column was used to control the pressure applied to the actuator channels . RIC microscopy was performed on an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 100 (cid:4) N . A . 1 . 46 alpha - plan - apochromat objective ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) and a CoolSnap CCD camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . Images were acquired with the Cytoscout software ( CBL GmbH , Linz , Austria ) . The excitation light was generated by a mercury lamp and a ﬁlter set ( AHF - Analysentechnik , T € ubingen , Germany ) consisting of a HQ545 / 30X excitation ﬁlter and a z532 / 650 / 780 dichroic . An HQ515 / 30M emission ﬁlter allowed observation of reﬂected light selectively around 530 nm . During the experiment the focal plane was kept constant with a focus - hold system based on the total internal reﬂection of a 780 nm laser at the glass slide ( CBL GmbH , Linz , Austria ) . 21 Acquired RIC microscopy images of the beads were analyzed as described by Schilling et al . 22 to determine the height of the bead above the glass slide using a custom written Matlab ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) program . Cell culture on the biochip For all experiments Madin – Darby canine kidney II ( MDCK II ; provided by Enrique Rodriguez - Boulan , Weill Cornell Medical College , NY ) cells were used . Cells were maintained at 37 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 in 10 cm diameter tissue culture dishes containing DMEM ( Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) , and 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) , and passaged every second or third day . In order to grow a polarized monolayer on the chip , the cell growth area was coated with ﬁbronectin . For this , chips were ﬁrst sterilized by washing with 70 % ethanol . Then a drop of phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ; Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) con - taining 0 . 01 mg ml (cid:5) 1 ﬁbronectin was applied to the cell culture surface and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . The chip was rinsed with PBS and then MDCK II cells detached from a tissue culture dish with trypsin – EDTA ( Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) were applied to the ﬁbronectin - coated area at high density . After allowing the cells to adhere on the ﬁbronectin - coated area for 1 h , non - attached cells were washed off . Cells were allowed to polarize for four days and then used for experiments . Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy MDCK II cells grown for four days on ﬁbronectin coated PDMS surfaces were ﬁxed for 15 min in 1 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature and then permeabilized for 5 min in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . After blocking in a solution containing 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , cells were incubated with primary antibodies against the desired endogenous proteins and appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to ﬂuorescent dyes . The following primary and secondary antibodies were used : ( Fig . 4A ) anti - E - cadherin ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and anti - mouse - Alexa - 647 ( Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) ; ( Fig . 4B ) anti - gp135 ( provided by J . Fuellekrug , Univ . Heidelberg , Ger - many ) and anti - mouse - Alexa - 647 ( Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) ; ( Fig . 4C ) anti - ZO - 1 ( Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) and anti - mouse - Alexa - 594 ( Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) . Nuclei were counter - stained with TO - PRO3 ( Fig . 4A and B ; Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) or DAPI ( Fig . 4C ) . Confocal images were recorded on a LSM 510 Meta Confocor 3 ( Fig . 4A and B ; Zeiss , Jena , Ger - many ) and an AxioObserver Z1 ( Fig . 4C ; Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a spinning disc unit ( CSU - X1 ; Yokogawa , Sugar Land , TX ) . Plasmids GPI – GFP was made from GPI – YFP ( provided by Enrique Rodriguez - Boulan , Weill Cornell Medical College , NY ) by changing the YFP to eGFP using the AgeI and BsrGI restriction sites . Live cell recording of apical vesicle fusion events MDCK II cells grown for four days on a chip were transfected for 5 h with the appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer but using doubled concentrations . Next , the medium was changed to Hank’s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ; Invitrogen , Lofer , Austria ) supplemented with 4 . 5 g l (cid:5) 1 glucose and 1 % FBS . A 20 (cid:3) C Golgi exit block was applied for 3 h to This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Lab Chip , 2011 , 11 , 3064 – 3071 | 3065 P ub li s h e d on 04 A ugu s t 2011 .

Then , the chip was transferred to the microscope and placed upside - down on a glass slide . Re - heating was started with a temperature - controlled stage and objective ( both heated to 37 (cid:3) C ) . To prevent adhesion of the apical membrane to the glass surface , glass slides were coated prior to usage with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) by incubation with a 5 % BSA solution for 30 min followed by rinsing . For TIRF microscopy of the apical membrane an inverted Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 100 (cid:4) N . A . 1 . 46 alpha - plan - apochromat objective ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) , a TIRF condenser ( Till - Photonics , Munich , Germany ) , a laser system emitting a laser line with 488 nm wavelength ( Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) and a CoolSnap CCD camera ( Photometrics , Tuscon , AZ ) were used . Images were acquired with the Cytosc - out software ( CBL GmbH , Linz , Austria ) using 40 ms exposure time and 60 ms delay time ensuring a frame rate of 10 fps . During the experiment the focal plane was kept constant with a focus - hold system . 21 The apical plasma membrane was approached to the glass slide and the pre - existing membrane signal in the evanescent wave region was removed by bleaching . 15 – 30 min after reheating to 37 (cid:3) C vesicles fusing with the apical membrane were observed . Analysis of vesicle fusion events Symmetrical two - dimensional Gaussian distributions were ﬁtted to the ﬂuorescent spots representing the fusing vesicle using a custom written Matlab ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) program . The red control curves in Fig . 5B were determined by measuring the cumulated or maximum intensities in an 11 (cid:4) 11 pixel region centred at the fusion site . Results Biochip function and design The chip with integrated actuators for sub - m m positioning was made of a biocompatible , ﬂexible and transparent material , poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) ( PDMS ) . 23 , 24 The functional principle of the biochip is outlined schematically in Fig . 1 . For cell culture , the chip was positioned upright as shown in Fig . 1A . In this conformation a well was formed with a platform of PDMS in the centre , which carried the cells and could be moved by the actu - ators . The upper surface of the central PDMS platform was coated with the extracellular matrix protein ﬁbronectin . 25 When epithelial cells were trypsinized and applied in solution to the well , they adhered only to the ﬁbronectin - coated area . The remaining untreated plain PDMS surfaces prevented cell adhe - sion because of their higher hydrophobicity . 26 – 28 In this conﬁg - uration a polarized epithelial monolayer could be grown on top of the central PDMS platform , in the same way as in a traditional cell culture dish . For apical TIRF imaging the chip was placed upside down on a suitable glass slide on an inverted microscope ( Fig . 1B ) . By conformal wetting of the outer PDMS frame to the glass surface a closed chamber was created , thereby preventing the loss of ﬂuid . The actuators were composed of closed end channels covered by a thin PDMS membrane . For production of the chip standard multilayer soft - lithography was used ( Fig . S1† ) . 19 In the last step of the manufacturing process the individual parts of the chip were plasma treated and then assembled . The plasma treatment activated the PDMS surfaces for a few minutes so that they could be bonded covalently . 28 , 29 While assembling , the actuator channels were pressurized , thereby causing the membrane covering the actuator channels to bulge . This ensured that the membrane was bonded to the central PDMS platform only along a small strip in the middle of the actuator channels . After the effect of the plasma treatment had faded , the pressure was released again . Therefore , if pressure was applied to the actuator channels in operation , the covering membrane could still bulge and in turn move the central PDMS platform in z direction . In this way , a miniaturized z - positioning tool was created . Fig . 2A shows a three - dimensional represen - tation of the actual design of the chip . In Fig . 2B , an exploded view of the individual parts of the chip before assembly is dis - played . In this design the actuator channel system is broken up into three separate segments that are all addressed by the same pressure . In addition , the surface of the central PDMS platform has engraved channels enabling efﬁcient drainage of ﬂuid during the approaching procedure . Biochip characterization : pressure – distance behaviour For characterization of the pressure controlled positioning system of the biochip , a distance determination using reﬂection interference contrast ( RIC ) microscopy was implemented .

The biochip contains integrated actuators for positioning of the central PDMS platform carrying the cells . ( A ) In a ﬁrst step the cells were cultured on a ﬁbro - nectin - coated area ( shown in orange ) , localized on the central platform , until a polarized monolayer was formed . ( B ) For TIRF microscopy of the apical membrane the chip was turned upside down and placed on a glass slide . Then , the central platform carrying the cells was approached to the glass surface by pressurizing the actuators . In the ﬁnal position the apical cell membrane localized within the evanescent ﬁeld of a totally internally reﬂected laser beam . 3066 | Lab Chip , 2011 , 11 , 3064 – 3071 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 P ub li s h e d on 04 A ugu s t 2011 .

View Article Online Monodisperse beads were attached to the cell growth area and the interference signal of light reﬂected from the glass surface and the bead surface was measured ( Fig . S2A† ) . Due to the spheri - cally shaped bead geometry circular interference patterns were generated ( Fig . S2B† ) . 30 , 31 These interference rings changed in diameter as the bead changed its distance from the surface . Fitting the radial intensity distribution of the bead interference patterns with the function I ( r ) ¼ A 0 + A 1exp ( (cid:5) b 1 r 2 ) + A 2exp ( (cid:5) b 2 r 2 ) (cid:4) cos ( 4 p n 2 / l ( g ( r ) + h ) + p ) ( 1 ) enabled determining the distance between the bead and the glass surface with nanometre accuracy 22 , 31 ( Fig . S2C† ) . In eqn ( 1 ) n 2 is the refractive index of the medium surrounding the bead , g ( r ) ¼ R (cid:5) ( R 2 (cid:5) r 2 ) 1 / 2 is a function describing the distance between the surface of a bead with radius R and a ﬂat surface , A 0 , A 1 , b 1 , A 2 and b 2 are ﬁtting parameters , and h is the distance between the bead and the glass surface . The radial intensity distribution I ( r ) was determined by circular averaging of the RIC microscopy image of a bead by the algorithm given by Schilling et al . 22 The pressure applied to the actuator channel system of the chip was controlled via a water column with adjustable height . For recording the pressure – distance dependence , the pressure applied to the actuator channels was changed stepwise by 0 . 5 mbar every 30 s . A representative pressure – distance curve is shown in Fig . 3 . In this ﬁgure the distance measured at the end of each 30 s period , when the system had relaxed to a stable position , is displayed . The raw data of the entire run are shown in Fig . S3† . In total , a distance of 1 . 2 m m from the glass interface was scanned , beyond the contrast of the RIC images of the bead was too low . Following an initial phase of nonlinear behaviour at smaller distances , a linear relationship was approximated . Taken together , the RIC measurements showed that the biochip provided the means for controllable positioning of the apical membrane into the TIRF ﬁeld . Cell culture on the biochip For live cell measurements Madin – Darby canine kidney II ( MDCK II ) cells were used , which are a well - described model system for polarized epithelia . 7 First , we established that MDCK II cells grown on ﬁbronectin - coated PDMS surfaces formed a polarized monolayer . For this we made use of endogenous marker proteins of the basolateral membrane , the apical membrane and the tight junctions that are E - cadherin , 32 – 34 gp135 / podocalyxin 35 , 36 and zonula occludens - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) , 37 respectively . Confocal microscopy of MDCK II cells cultured for four days on ﬁbronectin - coated PDMS surfaces revealed the characteristic basolateral localization of E - cadherin ( Fig . 4A ) and apical localization of gp135 ( Fig . 4B ) while the localization of ZO - 1 remained conﬁned to the tight junctions ( Fig . 4C ) , thereby conﬁrming correctly developed polarization . Recording apical vesicle fusion events To study vesicular delivery of proteins to the apical plasma membrane , GPI – GFP was used . GPI – GFP consists of a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol ( GPI ) anchor fused to the green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) and has been reported to be targeted constitu - tively to the apical plasma membrane in polarized MDCK II cells . 11 To ensure a high trafﬁcking rate of the protein , a protocol including a Golgi temperature block was chosen . 10 , 11 , 15 , 38 Terminally polarized MDCK II cells grown on the chip were transfected utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 ( ref . 39 ) for 5 h , which yielded sufﬁcient transfection in (cid:1) 5 % of the cells . Next , a 20 (cid:3) C temperature block was applied for 3 h to accumulate the protein of interest in the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) . For recording , the Fig . 2 Biochip design . ( A ) Three - dimensional representation of the design of the PDMS biochip with integrated actuators . ( B ) Exploded view of the four individual parts the chip is made of . Part 1 contains the actuator channel system and was manufactured by covalently bonding a thin PDMS membrane ( part 1b ) to a (cid:1) 5 mm thick PDMS piece exhibiting indentations for the channels ( part 1a ) . Part 2 constitutes the outer frame and has a thickness of 5 mm . Part 3 can be moved by the actuators and has a thickness of 4 . 5 mm . The front surface of part 3 carries the cell monolayer in operation and has engraved channels ( ﬂower - shaped structure ) to ensure ﬂuid drainage during the approach to a surface . Fig . 3 Pressure – distance behaviour of the biochip . The distance between beads attached to the cell culture surface of the chip and a glass slide was determined by RIC microscopy as a function of the pressure applied to the actuator channel system . The applied pressure was controlled via a water column with adjustable height and was determined from the height readings . Before measurement , the pressure was increased until the bead touched the glass surface . This pressure was deﬁned as 0 mbar . For recording the pressure – distance curve , the pressure was decreased by 0 . 5 mbar every 30 s . To ensure that the chip relaxed to a stable position , the actual distance measurement was taken at the end of each 30 s period . At pressure values smaller than (cid:5) 2 mbar the curve approximates a linear relationship with a slope of 445 nm mbar (cid:5) 1 .

View Article Online chip was placed on a microscope stage heated to 37 (cid:3) C to release the Golgi temperature block . With this protocol the cells showed some localization of GPI – GFP at the apical membrane even before the temperature block was released . This was probably due to trafﬁcking to the apical membrane before the Golgi temperature block or leakage of the Golgi temperature block . Nonetheless , this enabled controlled approaching of the apical cell membrane into the evanescent wave by continuous monitoring with apical TIRF imaging . As exempliﬁed in Fig . 4D , ﬁrst only the tips of some microvilli , which are small ﬁnger - like protrusions enlarging the apical membrane surface , 7 entered the evanescent ﬁeld ( Fig . 4D , left ) . Upon further approaching the whole apical membrane became visible ( Fig . 4D , right ) . This latter position was routinely chosen for monitoring apical vesicle fusion events . To prevent interac - tion of the apical membrane with the glass surface , the glass slide was coated prior to usage with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . As the pre - existing apical membrane signal would have masked any vesicle approaching the membrane , a brief 30 – 60 s photo - bleaching pulse in the TIRF illumination mode was applied to selectively cancel the ﬂuorescence of the pre - existing apical membrane signal . The small penetration depth of the evanescent ﬁeld ensured that the signal at all other parts of the cell , for example at the TGN , remained unaffected . Then , after 15 – 30 min incubation at 37 (cid:3) C , vesicles approaching the apical membrane became visible . Analysis of apical vesicle fusion events In order to identify a vesicle fusion event , a two - dimensional symmetrical Gaussian distribution was ﬁtted to the diffraction limited spots representing the vesicles . A vesicle fusion event shows a characteristic behaviour that can be identiﬁed by an analysis of the time course of three parameters describing the Gaussian . 10 The width 2 of the Gaussian increases due to the diffusive spreading of the vesicular content along the plasma membrane after fusion . The volume of the Gaussian , represent - ing the total intensity , increases suddenly upon fusion because the vesicle is entering regions with higher excitation intensity within the exponentially decaying evanescent wave . Finally , the amplitude of the Gaussian representing the peak intensity shows also a sudden increase upon fusion onset , but then decays exponentially as the cargo diffuses into the membrane after fusion . Fig . 5 shows the characterization of a representative apical vesicle fusion event ( see also ESI Movie S1† ) ; Fig . S4 and S5† provide additional examples of apical GPI – GFP fusion events ( see also ESI Movies S2 and S3† ) . Fig . 5A shows the recorded time lapse apical TIRF images of a GPI – GFP vesicle fusion event . Beneath each time lapse image a horizontal section through the intensity peak of the fusing vesicle is shown , together with the Gaussian ﬁtted to the peak . The intensity peak got suddenly higher upon fusion onset and then its amplitude decreased while the peak widened . In Fig . 5B the time course of the width 2 , the total intensity and the peak intensity of the Gaussian ﬁtted to the GPI – GFP fusion event are displayed . The time course of the parameters was consistent with the expected behaviour of a vesicle fusion event . 4 , 10 As a control , the total intensity and the peak intensity were also determined by measuring the cumulated intensity and maximum intensity , respectively , within an 11 (cid:4) 11 pixel region centred at the fusion site ( Fig . 5B , red lines ) . The time course of the parameters quantiﬁed in this alternative way followed the equivalent parameters of the ﬁtted Gaussian . The apical membrane of polarized MDCK II cells is highly structured and decorated with microvilli , and is delimited by the tight junctions . 7 , 40 A key issue in this context—so far unresolved in epithelial cell biology 13 , 41 —is which regions of the apical membrane are fusion competent . Fig . 6 shows the fusion sites of GPI – GFP bearing vesicles ( red circles ) as monitored over a time period of 10 min at the apical membrane of three individual cells . It is apparent that fusion events occurred all over the apical membrane . Discussion The developed PDMS - based biochip offers an all - in - one solution for apical TIRF microscopy and has several beneﬁcial features . First , cells could be directly cultured on the chip , in the same way Fig . 4 MDCK II cells on the biochip .

We demonstrated that MDCK II cells grown on a ﬁbronectin - coated PDMS surface form a polarized monolayer as conﬁrmed by the correct localization of endogenous marker proteins of the basolateral membrane ( E - cadherin ) , apical membrane ( gp135 ) , and tight junctions ( ZO - 1 ) ( see Fig . 4 ) . Second , if the chip was placed upside down on a glass slide for apical TIRF imaging , a self - sealing chamber was formed , which prevented leakage and evaporation of ﬂuid during measurement . Third , the integrated micromechanical actuators enabled well controlled positioning of the apical membrane of polarized cells into the region of the evanescent wave adjacent to the glass slide ( Fig . 4D ) . Fourth , channels engraved into the cell culture surface guaranteed efﬁ - cient drainage of ﬂuid during the approaching procedure . Therefore the biochip has signiﬁcant advantages over current approaches for apical TIRF microscopy , where cells grown on a ﬂexible membrane are forced down by weights to the glass slide . 16 – 18 Overall , the chip enables controllable positioning of the apical membrane and is easy and cheap to manufacture by standard soft - lithography technology .

Also the peak intensity was alternatively determined by measuring the maximum intensity in the same 11 (cid:4) 11 pixel region . The resulting values are displayed as red lines in the corresponding diagrams . The time course of the parameters shows the characteristic time dependence as expected from a vesicle fusion event : After fusion onset ( (cid:1) 0 . 3 s ) , the volume of the Gaussian representing the total intensity suddenly increases , the amplitude of the Gaussian representing the peak intensity ﬁrst increases and then decays exponentially , while the width 2 increases .

View Article Online The recent development of novel high speed and high - resolu - tion live cell microscopy techniques has provided new insights into vesicular trafﬁcking in polarized epithelial cells . 11 , 13 – 15 High - speed confocal microscopy data have proven that basolateral proteins like VSVG – YFP and apical proteins like GPI – YFP are vectorially trafﬁcked to the appropriate cell pole . 13 , 14 However , the last step in the transport process , which is the fusion of individual vesicles with the target membrane , has remained unresolved . 13 Utilizing the developed biochip enabled us to close this gap by taking advantage of the unique spatiotemporal resolution of TIRF microscopy . 4 Vesicle fusion events at the apical membrane of MDCK II cells were directly imaged and revealed speciﬁc features of apical trafﬁcking . Many of the fusion events showed a noncircular diffusive spreading of the cargo away from the fusion site , as it can be seen in the apical TIRF image sequence of the GPI – GFP fusion event shown in Fig . 5A . This can be explained by the fact that the microvilli - decorated apical membrane has a non - ﬂat topology on the length scale of the diffusive spreading . To ensure that the ﬁtting of a symmetrical Gaussian represents an appropriate approximation for the asymmetric events , the total intensity and the peak intensity were determined in an alterna - tive way . The total counts within an 11 (cid:4) 11 pixel region cen - tred at the fusion site gave an alternative measure for the total intensity carried by the vesicle , while taking the maximum intensity from the same region served as alternative measure for the peak intensity . The time course of these parameters followed the time course of the equivalent parameters obtained from the ﬁtted Gaussian ( see Fig . 5B ) . Taken together , the generic characteristics expected from the diffusive spreading of the vesicular cargo upon fusion within the exponentially decaying evanescent wave 4 , 9 , 10 are valid for these asymmetric fusion events . Furthermore , the developed apical TIRF biochip enabled us for the ﬁrst time to map the fusion sites of vesicles bearing GPI – GFP at the apical membrane of MDCK II cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Our data indicate that the fusion sites are distributed all over the apical membrane , suggesting that protein complexes facili - tating vesicle tethering 7 are also present all over the apical membrane . Conclusions A PDMS - based biochip was developed that offers an efﬁcient solution for apical TIRF microscopy . MDCK II cells could be cultured to form a polarized monolayer directly on the chip . The integrated pressure controlled positioning system allowed precise approaching of the apical cell membrane into the region of evanescent ﬁeld excitation adjacent to a glass slide . Hence , the biochip represents a versatile tool to study apical trafﬁcking in polarized epithelial cells . A protocol was established for moni - toring constitutive trafﬁcking of GPI – GFP to the apical plasma membrane based on transient lipofection of polarized MDCK II cells and a Golgi temperature block . Together , this toolbox allowed for the ﬁrst time real - time imaging of vesicles bearing GPI – GFP undergoing fusion at the apical plasma membrane . We were able to reveal that vesicles fuse all over the apical plasma membrane , thereby shedding light onto basic questions in epithelial cell biology . Finally , the chip demonstrates a promising strategy to integrate micromechanical actuators into PDMS - based devices .
