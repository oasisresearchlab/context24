Schiller * Laboratory of Cellular Oncology , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , Maryland Received 28 July 2004 / Accepted 14 October 2004 The papillomavirus capsid is a nonenveloped icosahedral shell formed by the viral major structural protein , L1 . It is known that disulﬁde bonds between neighboring L1 molecules help to stabilize the capsid . However , the kinetics of inter - L1 disulﬁde bond formation during particle morphogenesis have not previously been examined . We have recently described a system for producing high - titer papillomavirus - based gene transfer vectors ( also known as pseudoviruses ) in mammalian cells . Here we show that papillomavirus capsids pro - duced using this system undergo a maturation process in which the formation of inter - L1 disulﬁde bonds drives condensation and stabilization of the capsid . Fully mature capsids exhibit improved regularity and resistance to proteolytic digestion . Although capsid maturation for other virus types has been reported to occur in seconds or minutes , papillomavirus capsid maturation requires overnight incubation . Maturation of the capsids of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 proceeds through an ordered accumulation of dimeric and trimeric L1 species , whereas the capsid of bovine papillomavirus type 1 matures into more extensively cross - linked forms . The presence of encapsidated DNA or the minor capsid protein , L2 , did not have major effects on the kinetics or extent of capsid maturation . Immature capsids and capsids formed from L1 mutants with impaired disulﬁde bond formation are infectious but physically fragile . Consequently , capsid maturation is essential for efﬁcient puriﬁcation of papillomavirus - based gene transfer vectors . Despite their obvious morphological differences , mature and immature capsids are similarly neutralizable by various L1 - and L2 - speciﬁc antibodies . Papillomaviruses , which are etiologically implicated in the development of warts , cervical cancer , and other epithelial tumors , replicate in the stratiﬁed squamous epithelium of the skin or mucous membranes ( reviewed in reference 18 ) . The papillomavirus life cycle is closely tied to the epithelial differ - entiation program , which takes many days to complete . The eventual release of the nonenveloped virion is thought to de - pend primarily on the normal cellular disintegration typically seen near the surface of squamous epithelia . The complexity of mimicking stratiﬁed epithelial differenti - ation in culture has made it challenging to study the papillo - maviral life cycle in vitro . As a result , much of what is known about papillomavirus morphogenesis has been learned by studying recombinant versions of the two viral structural pro - teins , L1 and L2 . The major capsid protein , L1 , can spontane - ously self - assemble into 72 - pentamer virus - like particles ( VLPs ) that closely resemble native papillomavirus virions ( 20 ) . The minor capsid protein , L2 , is important for papillo - mavirus infectivity ( 38 ) , but its arrangement in the virion and its role in encapsidation of the 8 - kb double - stranded circular viral genomic DNA remain unclear . We have recently described a system for generating high - titer papillomavirus - based gene transfer vectors ( also known as pseudoviruses ) by coexpression of L1 and L2 in mammalian cells cotransfected with various (cid:2) 8 - kb reporter plasmids ( 2 ) . The production system represents a tractable in vitro model in which papillomavirus capsid morphogenesis can be related to infectivity . Using this system , we have found that papillomavi - rus capsids expressed in mammalian cells undergo a morpho - logical maturation process following cell lysis . Although mat - uration is a typical feature of viral capsids , it is generally a rapid process coordinated by encapsidation of viral nucleic acids , ejection of scaffolding proteins , and / or proteolytic cleav - age of virion components . In contrast to the maturation of most other viral capsids , maturation of the papillomavirus cap - sid takes many hours to complete and appears to be driven primarily by the formation of intermolecular disulﬁde bonds . Although immature papillomavirus capsids are infectious , they are physically fragile . Incorporation of a maturation step is therefore essential for production of puriﬁed papillomavirus - based vector stocks . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .

Thus , in addition to expressing L1 , p16L1 - GFP can also serve as a target reporter plasmid suitable for packaging . HPV16 L1 constructs pC175S and pC428S were gener - ated by PCR mutagenesis of p16L1 - GFP . Production of neutralization assay stock was performed by cotransfecting 293TT cells with p16L1 - GFP ( or pC175S ) , p16L2h , and pYSEAP ( 26 ) . Cell culture and capsid production . Production and puriﬁcation of papillo - mavirus - based gene transfer vectors and VLPs using 293TT cells were accom - plished using previously reported methods ( 2 ) , with minor modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , 293TT cells were cotransfected ( Lipofectamine 2000 ; Invitrogen ) with codon - modiﬁed L1 and L2 expression plasmids and , in some instances , target plasmid pfwB . Two days after transfection , the cells were suspended at 10 8 cells per ml in Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) with calcium and magnesium ( DPBS ; Invitrogen ) supplemented with 9 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 % Brij 58 ( Sigma ) , 0 . 2 % Benzonase ( Sigma ) , and 0 . 1 % Plasmid Safe exonuclease ( Epicentre ) . The resulting cell lysate was incubated at 37°C and then chilled , adjusted to 0 . 8 M NaCl , and clariﬁed by centrifugation at 2 , 000 (cid:4) g for 15 min at 4°C . To purify capsids , the clariﬁed cell lysates were ultracentrifuged through Op - tiprep gradients , as previously described ( 2 ) . Core gradient fractions with appre - ciable amounts of L1 were pooled for analysis . Electron microscopic ( EM ) analysis of puriﬁed capsids was performed on nitrocellulose - carbon grids stained with 1 % uranyl acetate using a Philips CM120 microscope at 33 , 000 (cid:4) magniﬁ - cation . Titration of lysates and puriﬁed stocks was performed using 293TT cells as targets . A total of 2 (cid:4) 10 5 cells were preplated several hours in advance in 0 . 5 ml per well in 24 - well plates . The cells were treated with 1 (cid:5) l of papillomaviral vector stock or stock diluted in DPBS – 0 . 8 M NaCl and then incubated for 48 h . Expression of GFP was detected using a FACSCalibur device ( Becton Dickin - son ) , and the titer was calculated using the following formula : ( 2 (cid:4) 10 5 cells ) (cid:4) ( 1 , 000 (cid:5) l / ml ) (cid:4) ( dilution factor ) (cid:4) ( fraction of cells expressing GFP ) (cid:3) trans - ducing units per milliliter . Western blotting . Because of the high apparent molecular weight of disulﬁde - bonded L1 species , nonreducing Western assays were performed using precast 3 - to - 8 % Tris - acetate ( sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophore - sis ) gels ( Invitrogen ) , which allow for effective separation of large proteins . Cell lysates were prepared for nonreducing separation by 1 : 40 dilution into 1 (cid:4) Nu - page load dye ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 25 mM (cid:6) - iodoacetamide ( Calbio - chem ) . The lysate was then denatured at 65°C for 10 min . FIG . 1 . Electron micrographs of HPV16 capsids . ( A and B ) Lysates of cells transfected with HPV16 L1 and L2 expression vectors were incubated for 1 or 24 h , respectively , and then subjected to puriﬁcation through Optiprep gradients . The samples were then examined by transmission EM . ( C ) The puriﬁed material used in panel A was incubated at 37°C for 24 h and then subjected to EM using the same grid preparation methods and magniﬁcation . FIG . 2 . DNA content of Optiprep - puriﬁed HPV16 capsids . Nuclease - resistant DNA was extracted from Optiprep - fractionated capsids sub - jected to prior incubation at 37°C for the time shown . During the extraction , the samples were spiked with 0 . 5 ng of a 1 - kb DNA marker fragment to monitor recovery . The puriﬁed DNA samples were digested with BglII , separated on an agarose gel , and stained with SYBR Green I . It was necessary to dilute the sample recovered from the material incubated for 24 h in order to compare it to the 1 - and 4 - h samples .

Trypsin digestion was performed by mixing cell lysate samples with an equal volume of 0 . 25 % trypsin stock ( Invitrogen ) followed by incubation at 37°C for 10 min . The digested lysate was then chilled and diluted 1 : 40 with 1 (cid:4) Nupage load dye supplemented with 5 % 2 - mercaptoethanol and 1 (cid:4) Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Trypsin - digested sam - ples and untreated lysates diluted 1 : 40 in 1 (cid:4) Nupage load dye with 2 - mercap - toethanol were denatured at 65°C for 10 min . Both types of gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio - Rad ) using Nupage transfer buffer ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturers’ in - structions . Unstained protein standards ( HiMark or BenchMark ; Invitrogen ) were detected by staining the blot with Ponceau S solution ( Sigma ) . The blot was then blocked in Tris - buffered saline ( Bio - Rad ) with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) supplemented with 5 % nonfat dry milk ( Carnation ) . BPV1 blots were probed with MAB837 ( Chemicon ) diluted 1 : 2 , 000 in TBST . HPV16 and HPV18 blots were probed with Camvir - 1 ( Pharmingen ) diluted 1 : 10 , 000 in TBST . Goat anti - mouse – horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody ( Bio - Rad ) was detected by chemiluminescence ( Perkin - Elmer ) . DNA analysis . Nuclease - resistant DNA was extracted from Optiprep fractions using a Qiaquick PCR puriﬁcation kit ( QIAGEN ) . Prior to extraction , the sam - ple was spiked with a puriﬁed 1 - kb BspHI ( NEB ) fragment of pBluescript II KS ( (cid:1) ) ( Stratagene ) in order to monitor the efﬁciency of DNA recovery . Nucle - ase - resistant DNA was extracted from cell lysates by phenol chloroform extrac - tion and ethanol precipitation as previously described ( 2 ) . Nicking of packaged plasmid DNA ( see Fig . 5 , below ) was likely the result of incomplete nuclease inactivation , since plasmids extracted from Optiprep - fractionated capsids were predominantly supercoiled ( data not shown ) ( 2 ) . A control sample of puriﬁed target plasmid DNA was nicked using the enzyme N . BstNBI ( NEB ) . In some instances , plasmids were linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme BglII ( NEB ) . DNA samples were separated on 0 . 9 % Tris - acetate - EDTA agarose gels and then stained with SYBR Green I ( Sigma ) . A 1 - kb Plus DNA ladder ( In - vitrogen ) was used as a standard . Neutralization assays . Neutralization assays ( 26 ) were performed using crude vector stocks diluted 1 : 10 , 000 . Antibody H16 . V5 was provided by Neil Chris - tensen ( 5 ) . Neutralizing sera from several vaccinees in a phase I clinical trial of HPV16 VLPs ( 14 ) or from HPV16 - infected women ( 21 ) were selected based on moderate or high neutralizing activity ( 26 ) . Serum from rabbits immunized with HPV16 L2 was provided by Richard Roden ( Johns Hopkins Medical Institu - tions ) . RESULTS Stabilization of HPV16 capsids . Production of papillomavi - ral vectors can be accomplished by cotransfection of codon - modiﬁed versions of the papillomavirus L1 and L2 genes , to - gether with a reporter plasmid , into a 293 cell line ( 293TT ) engineered to overexpress simian virus 40 T antigen . The as - sembly of L1 and L2 around cotransfected reporter plasmids is promiscuous and does not require DNA packaging sequences in cis or expression of any papillomavirus early genes in trans ( 2 ) . Although the production methods were originally developed for BPV1 - based vectors , the methods can also be used to make crude HPV16 vector stocks with titers comparable to BPV1 stocks ( 2 ) . Our initial report detailed methods for efﬁcient single - step puriﬁcation of BPV1 vectors by ultracentrifugation through an Optiprep velocity - density gradient . However , sub - sequent attempts to apply the puriﬁcation method to HPV16 - and HPV18 - based vectors resulted in (cid:7) 95 % losses of input titer ( 26 ) . The titer of BPV1 vector stocks was also more resistant to other physical insults , such as sonication or re - peated freeze - thaw cycles ( data not shown ) . Using resistance to freeze - thaw to assay stability , we exam - ined a variety of harvest procedures to ﬁnd a method that might stabilize the titer of HPV16 and HPV18 vector stocks . One method that successfully stabilized the titer of HPV16 and HPV18 vector stocks was lysis of vector - producing cells in PBS supplemented with the nonionic detergent Brij 58 and a nu - clease cocktail , followed by overnight incubation of the lysate at 37°C . EM analysis showed that HPV16 capsids stabilized by over - night incubation reproducibly exhibited decreased size and increased regularity compared to capsids puriﬁed without prior maturation ( Fig . 1A and B ) . EM analysis of unpuriﬁed mature and immature capsids in clariﬁed cell lysate revealed compa - rable morphological differences ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the extremely open conﬁguration of immature HPV16 capsids was not simply an artifact of the puriﬁcation process . Interestingly , incubating puriﬁed immature HPV16 capsids at 37°C overnight did not effectively convert the capsids to a fully mature appearance ( Fig . 1C ) . This failure to mature might be due to irreversible distortion of the immature capsid during puriﬁcation . Alternatively , the poor maturation of puriﬁed HPV16 capsids could imply a need for components present in cell lysates , as has recently been described for in vitro assembly of polyomavirus capsids ( 6 ) . In addition to producing morphological changes in HPV16 capsids , overnight incubation of crude lysates dramatically im - proved titer recovery following Optiprep puriﬁcation of HPV16 and HPV18 vector stocks ( data not shown ) ( see the chart at the bottom of Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , incubation of the lysate at 37°C for 4 h was insufﬁcient for stabilizing the titer of the HPV16 vector stock . The titer loss seen following puriﬁ - cation of immature vector stocks correlated with a substantial loss of encapsidated reporter plasmid DNA ( Fig . 2 ) . This sug - gests that the titer loss following puriﬁcation of immature stocks was due to evisceration of the immature particles during the Optiprep puriﬁcation , perhaps due to the high shear forces and hydrostatic pressure associated with ultracentrifugation . Capsid maturation is associated with disulﬁde bonding and trypsin resistance . Intermolecular disulﬁde bonds are known to contribute to the stability of papillomavirus capsids ( 23 , 30 ) . To study the kinetics of inter - L1 disulﬁde bond formation during maturation , we performed nonreducing Western blot - ting on lysates of cells transfected with HPV16 L1 or cotrans - fected with L1 and L2 . As seen in Fig . 3A , monomeric L1 predominated immediately after cell lysis . Incubation of the lysates at 37°C led to a progressive increase in multimeric L1 forms and a concomitant loss of L1 monomers . Accumulation of multimeric species required many hours of incubation and was not inﬂuenced by the coexpression of L2 . We interpret the bands with apparent molecular masses of roughly 195 and 215 kDa as distinct species of disulﬁde - linked L1 trimers . Close inspection of lightly exposed ﬁlms revealed that the dimer band ( apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa ) is actually composed of a poorly resolved doublet seen at the 16 - , 24 - , and 48 - h time points . The slower - migrating dimer and the faster - migrating trimer species both appear earlier in the mat - uration process , suggesting that disulﬁde bonding in the capsid occurs in an ordered sequence of events . Previous reports have shown that treatment of assembled capsids with reducing agents results in the exposure of trypsin - sensitive sites in L1 ( 23 ) . Conversely , it would be predicted that formation of inter - L1 disulﬁde bonds within the capsid might lead to increased resistance to trypsin digestion . Figure 3B shows that the increased inter - L1 disulﬁde bonding seen after prolonged incubation of the lysate at 37°C correlates with V OL . 79 , 2005 MATURATION OF PAPILLOMAVIRUS CAPSIDS 2841 on S ep t e m be r 8 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m increased trypsin resistance . Incorporation of L2 in the capsids had little impact on the kinetics of acquisition of trypsin resis - tance . Analysis of cells transfected with HPV18 L1 or HPV18 L1 and L2 showed a nearly identical accumulation of L1 mul - timers and trypsin resistance ( data not shown ) . In contrast to HPV16 and HPV18 , the maturation of BPV1 capsids progressed through a wide variety of L1 multimer spe - cies , ending in species with apparent molecular weights large enough to prevent exit from the wells of nonreducing gels ( Fig . 4A ) . BPV1 virions extracted from infected bovine tissue ( 7 ) also failed to exit the wells . Despite the more extensive disul - ﬁde cross - linking of BPV1 L1 , the acquisition of trypsin resis - tance followed kinetics similar to that with HPV16 ( compare Fig . 3B and 4B ) . Coexpression of BPV1 L2 did not have a substantial impact on L1 disulﬁde bonding or trypsin resis - tance . DNA content of BPV1 , HPV16 , and HPV18 capsids . In a previous report involving puriﬁed HPV33 capsids , the pres - ence of encapsidated DNA was found to correlate with in - creased L1 disulﬁde cross - linking and trypsin resistance ( 12 ) . We have previously found that L2 expression is strictly re - quired for encapsidation of DNA within BPV1 capsids ( 2 ) . Since coexpression of L2 is not required for disulﬁde cross - linking or trypsin resistance of BPV1 L1 capsids ( Fig . 4 ) , it can be inferred that BPV1 capsid maturation is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the presence of encapsidated DNA . As noted above , incorporation of HPV16 and HPV18 L2 did not appre - ciably inﬂuence capsid maturation . However , it is not known whether HPV16 or HPV18 L1 can encapsidate DNA in the absence of L2 . To determine whether L2 expression is required for DNA encapsidation in HPV16 and HPV18 capsids , we examined the nuclease - resistant DNA content of cells transfected with L1 alone or cotransfected with L1 and L2 of BPV1 , HPV16 , or HPV18 . The results conﬁrmed that , for BPV1 , L2 coexpression is strictly required for DNA encapsidation ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , cells transfected with HPV16 L1 alone contained substantial amounts of nuclease - resistant DNA . Although signiﬁcant amounts of encapsidated target plasmid DNA were present in HPV16 L1 - only and L1 / L2 particles , the majority of the encapsidated DNA in both types of HPV16 capsid appeared to be comprised of linear DNA species ( com - pare Fig . 5A and B ) . These linear DNA species presumably represent partially encapsidated loops of cellular DNA that were trimmed by the nucleases added to the lysis buffer . Cells cotransfected with HPV16 L1 and L2 yielded nuclease - resis - tant DNA fragments similar in size to the (cid:8) 8 - kb genome of HPV16 . In contrast , cells transfected with HPV16 L1 alone had a variety of smaller nuclease - resistant DNA species . HPV18 showed a phenotype intermediate between those of BPV1 and HPV16 in that expression of HPV18 L2 was re - quired for encapsidation of DNA , but the encapsidated DNA in the L1 / L2 - transfected cells was predominantly comprised of linear (cid:8) 8 - kb cellular DNA fragments . In all cases , L2 was strictly required for transduction of target cells with GFP ( chart at the bottom of Fig . 5 ) . The observations show that encapsidated DNA is not required for capsid maturation . Oxidation accelerates maturation . The above experiments were performed using cells lysed at high density ( 100 million cells per ml ) in detergent - supplemented PBS . To address the possibility that the slow kinetics of disulﬁde bond formation might be an artifact of the lysis conditions , we performed kinetic analyses of disulﬁde bond formation in lower - density lysates ( 10 million cells per ml ) , in lysates using various buffer FIG . 3 . Western blots of transfected cell lysates . Cells transfected only with a plasmid expressing HPV16 L1 ( left panels ) or cotrans - fected with plasmids expressing both HPV16 L1 and L2 ( right panels ) were lysed in PBS supplemented with Brij 58 . The lysate was then incubated for the time shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure . ( A ) The lysate was separated on a nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyac - rylamide gel electrophoresis gel and then subjected to anti - L1 Western blotting .

In all cases we observed protracted intermo - lecular L1 disulﬁde bonding kinetics ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , addition of the oxidizing agents ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide ( data not shown ) or oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) to the cell lysate dramatically accelerated disulﬁde bonding ( Fig . 6A ) . GSSG - treated lysates also showed faster acquisition of L1 resistance to trypsin digestion ( Fig . 6B ) . As seen in panel C of Fig . 6 , addition of GSSG ultimately resulted in partial proteolytic degradation of L1 in the lysate . This could be due either to activation of cellular proteases in the lysate or to partial misfolding of the capsid during the accelerated matu - ration process . Mutation of cysteine 175 or 428 prevents maturation . Cys - teines homologous to HPV16 L1 cysteines 175 and 428 have previously been shown to participate in intermolecular disul - ﬁde bonds within papillomavirus capsids ( 23 , 29 ) . We therefore mutated these cysteines to serine ( mutants C175S and C428S ) to observe the effect on capsid maturation and infectivity . After overnight maturation , the C175S mutant displayed low levels of a 115 - kDa aberrant dimer species , whereas the C428S mu - tant remained almost exclusively monomeric ( Fig . 7A ) . As seen in panel B of Fig . 7 , mutation of cysteine 175 or 428 prevented the acquisition of trypsin resistance after overnight incubation , conﬁrming that formation of disulﬁde bonds is essential for capsid maturation . Surprisingly , crude vector stock made using the C175S mu - tant displayed nearly wild - type GFP transduction levels ( chart at the bottom of Fig . 7 ) . However , vector stocks generated using the C175S mutant were physically unstable and attempts to purify C175S mutant capsids yielded severely distorted non - infectious particles ( data not shown ) . Vector stocks made using the C428S mutant were also com - petent for transduction , but at levels of only 0 . 3 % of the wild - FIG . 5 . Nuclease - resistant DNA in transfected cell lysates .

Despite its low transduction competence , the crude C428S vector preparation contained encapsidated DNA at levels nearly identical to that of stocks made using wild - type L1 ( data not shown ) . Attempts to purify capsids from overnight - matured C428S stock were unsuccessful , as the L1 in the lysate failed to penetrate the gradient , presumably due to dissociation of the capsids into capsomers ( 23 , 29 ) . The results show that mutant HPV16 capsomers with deﬁcient disulﬁde bonding form fragile , transduction - competent particles . In BPV1 L1 , cysteine 426 is homologous to HPV16 cysteine 428 . Since BPV1 L1 showed evidence of more extensive disul - ﬁde bonding compared to HPV16 ( Fig . 3 and 4 ) , we con - structed a BPV1 C426S mutant . Cells transfected with the BPV1 L1 C426S mutant exhibited a regular ladder of L1 mul - timers in nonreducing Western assays ( data not shown ) . This result reinforces the notion that the BPV1 capsid can form additional inter - L1 disulﬁde bonds that do not involve cysteine 426 . Antibody neutralization of mature and immature vector stocks . Papillomaviral vectors have signiﬁcant utility as tools for detecting HPV - neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated and naturally infected individuals ( 26 , 27 ) . We therefore sought to determine whether mature and immature vector stocks could be similarly neutralized by various types of antibodies . In a panel of experiments involving the neutralizing monoclonal antibody H16 . V5 ( 5 ) , sera from VLP - vaccinated women ( 14 ) , sera from naturally HPV16 - infected women ( 21 ) , or polyclonal anti - HPV16 L2 rabbit serum , we found essentially no differ - ence in the 50 % neutralization cutoffs for crude stocks of mature , immature , and C175S mutant HPV16 vectors ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION During their assembly , the capsids of many types of viruses have been shown to undergo maturation through an ordered process of conformational changes ( reviewed in reference 1 ) . In many instances , the maturation process is triggered by pro - teolytic processing of virion components ( reviewed in refer - ences 3 , 16 , 17 , and 34 ) . In other cases , capsid maturation steps coincide with entry of the viral genome ( 9 ) or ejection of viral scaffolding proteins ( reviewed in reference 8 ) . In all cases where normal capsid maturation kinetics have been studied , the process has been thought to occur on a time scale of seconds or minutes . Our results show that , unlike many other types of viral capsids , papillomavirus capsids undergo an ex - tremely slow maturation process that is driven by the formation of disulﬁde bonds between L1 molecules . Maturation of the capsid results in increased physical stability , increased resis - tance to tryptic proteolysis , and a decrease in particle size in electron micrographs . It is possible that the relative slowness of papillomavirus capsid maturation is a reﬂection of the long overall time scale of the viral life cycle in vivo . Unlike conventionally lytic non - enveloped viruses , papillomaviruses are thought to be released by the gradual process of desquamation typically seen near the surface of the epithelium . Thus , the papillomavirus capsid is probably exposed to partially oxidizing conditions for several days prior to release into the environment . Despite their phys - ical fragility , our data show that immature virions can be nearly as infectious as fully mature virions , leaving open the possibil - ity that immature virions released from deeper layers of the epithelia could play a role in natural infection . It has been shown that treatment of assembled papilloma - virus capsids with reducing agents can cause either expansion of the capsid ( 23 ) or complete disassembly of the capsid into capsomers ( 30 ) . However , the forward process of capsid mat - uration has not previously been examined in detail ( 36 ) . It is possible that the maturation of papillomavirus capsids has been largely overlooked , because L1 is usually expressed using lytic systems , such as baculovirus , vaccinia virus , or Semliki Forest virus vectors ( 13 , 15 , 20 , 39 ) . In such systems , viral cytopathic effects probably induce an altered redox potential ( 31 ) in a fraction of the cells , resulting in a mixture of imma - ture and mature capsids . Such mixed populations may also be typical of capsids isolated from papillomavirus - induced lesions , perhaps reﬂecting harvest of immature capsids derived from deeper layers of the lesion ( 11 , 35 ) . Our nonlytic mammalian expression system has allowed the synchronous study of capsid maturation beginning with a uniformly immature population of capsids . Our results using nonreducing Western blotting conﬁrm ob - servations by other groups that cysteine 428 of HPV16 L1 ( or its homolog in other HPV types ) is critically involved in in - ter - L1 disulﬁde bond formation in the capsid ( 19 , 23 , 25 , 29 ) . However , our ﬁnding that the HPV16 capsid apparently con - tains two species of L1 trimer and two species of L1 dimer is FIG . 7 . ( A to C ) Western blots of cells transfected with cysteine mutant L1 constructs . Cells were cotransfected with a construct ex - pressing HPV16 L2 together with wild - type or cysteine mutant L1 constructs C175S or C428S . The cells were lysed and then incubated at 37°C for 10 min or 18 h . The chart at the bottom of the ﬁgure shows the titer of the lysates standardized to the titer found in the wild - type L1 lysate after 10 min of incubation at 37°C . 2844 BUCK ET AL . J .

The presence of multiple dimeric and trimeric species is po - tentially consistent with more recent data from Ishii and col - leagues suggesting that intermolecular disulﬁde bonds involv - ing cysteine 185 may also be present in the capsid ( 19 ) . Since cysteines 175 and 185 are thought to share an external loop ( 4 ) , it is possible that the quasi - atomic invading arm model of the papillomavirus capsid recently proposed by Modis and col - leagues ( 25 ) could accommodate 185 – 428 disulﬁde bonds with only minor rearrangements . Thus , one simple explanation of our observations would be that 175 – 428 bonds are a prerequi - site for formation of dimeric L1 species , while trimeric species involve a mixture of 175 – 428 and 185 – 428 bonds . To further examine the issue , we constructed a panel of L1 mutants tar - geting each cysteine in L1 . The C185S mutant could not be evaluated because its steady - state expression levels were too low to be reliably detected by Western blotting . All of the other cysteine - to - serine mutants exhibited a normal pattern of dimers and trimers after maturation ( unpublished observa - tion ) . The observation conﬁrms the theory that cysteines other than 175 , 185 , and 428 are dispensable for dimer and trimer formation but leaves open the question of precisely how cys - teines 175 , 185 , and 428 might participate in disulﬁde bonding within the mature capsid . The BPV1 capsid exhibits a higher degree of disulﬁde cross - linking than the HPV16 or HPV18 capsids . This difference in potential for cross - linking might explain why immature BPV1 - based vectors are more robust than immature HPV16 and HPV18 vectors . We speculated that the higher degree of cross - linking in the BPV1 capsid might be an evolutionary adapta - tion to its environmentally exposed mode of transmission . To address the question , we examined the L1 disulﬁde cross - link - ing status of several cutaneous papillomavirus types for which we have recently constructed codon - modiﬁed expression plas - mids ( unpublished data ) . The mature capsids of cottontail rab - bit papillomavirus and HPVs 1 , 2 , and 6 showed a pattern of L1 dimers and trimers nearly indistinguishable from the pattern seen for HPVs 16 and 18 ( unpublished result ) . Thus , extensive disulﬁde cross - linking is not a typical feature of cutaneous papillomavirus types . We also noted heterogeneity in the degree to which different papillomavirus capsids exclude cellular DNA . Nuclease - treated HPV16 and HPV18 L1 / L2 vector stocks contained substantial amounts of encapsidated cellular DNA ( Fig . 5 ) , reminiscent of early reports of adventitious uptake of cellular DNA fragments by polyomaviruses ( 24 , 33 ) and more recent reports of encapsidation of cellular DNA by HPV33 capsids ( 12 ) . The presence of encapsidated cellular DNA fragments implies that , prior to cell lysis , papillomavirus procapsids can exist in a partially assembled state around loops of cellular DNA . BPV1 - based vector stocks contained relatively little en - capsidated cellular DNA , suggesting that comparable BPV1 procapsids either fail to exclude nucleases or are less abundant at steady state . The role of the minor capsid protein , L2 , in papillomavirus morphogenesis is poorly understood . Some previous reports have suggested that the L2s of various papillomavirus types are required for encapsidation of DNA ( 32 , 38 ) , but other reports have found substantial amounts of DNA within L1 - only VLPs ( 12 ) . In this report , we have shown that the discrepant results may stem in part from biological differences between different papillomavirus capsids . In our system , HPV16 L1 is competent for uptake of small DNA species when expressed in the ab - sence of L2 , whereas BPV1 and HPV18 L1 - only particles con - tain very little encapsidated DNA . Interestingly , the presence of HPV16 L2 inﬂuences the average size of encapsidated cel - lular DNA loops , implying some role for L2 in DNA packag - ing , even for HPV16 capsids . Since coexpression of L2 had little effect on capsid maturation for BPV1 or HPV18 , it is possible to conclude that encapsidated DNA is dispensable for capsid maturation . We did not observe a major difference in the antibody neu - tralization proﬁles for mature and immature HPV16 vector stocks . The results suggest that immunodominant neutralizing epitopes on the virion surface are formed prior to maturation , consistent with the ability of disassembled capsomers to induce robust neutralizing antibody responses ( 28 ) . The results imply that papillomavirus vaccines currently in development will have similar efﬁcacy against mature and immature virions . REFERENCES 1 . Baker , T . S . , N . H . Olson , and S . D .
