Different molecular weights or chain lengths of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) were mixed and then grafted to a polyurethane ( PU ) surface , a model smooth surface , to form a nanometer ( nm ) scale of roughness for PU - PEG surfaces ( PU - PEG mix ) while PEG with a molecular weight of 2000 was also grafted to PU to form PU - PEG 2000 for comparison . In addition , the concept was tested on cell - adhesive peptide Gly – Arg – Gly – Asp ( GRGD ) that was photochemically grafted to PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG 2000 surfaces ( e . g . , PU - PEG mix - GRGD and PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD surfaces , respectively ) . To prepare GRGD - grafted PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG 2000 surface , 0 . 025 m of GRGD - SANPAH ( N - Succinimidyl - 6 - [ 4 0 - azido - 2 0 - nitrophenylamino ] - hexanoate ) solutions was grafted to PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG 2000 by surface adsorption of the peptide and subsequent ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation for photoreaction . The grafting efﬁciencies for GRGD to PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG 2000 surfaces were about 67 % for both surfaces , semi - quantitatively analyzed by an HPLC . The surface roughness , presented with a roughness parameter , R a ; and the topography of the tested surfaces were both measured and imaged by an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . Among the R a values of the ﬁlms , PU was the smoothest ( e . g . , R a ¼ 1 : 53 7 0 : 20 nm , n ¼ 3 ) while PU - PEG mix was the roughest ( e . g . , R a ¼ 39 : 79 7 10 . 48nm , n ¼ 4 ) . Moreover , R a values for PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG mix - GRGD surfaces were about 20 nm larger than those for PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD , respectively , which were consistent with the topographies of the ﬁlms . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) were adhered and grown on the tested surfaces after 36 h of incubation . Among the ﬁlms , HUVEC’s adhesion on the surface of PU - PEG mix - GRGD was the densest while that on the surface of PU - PEG 2000 was the sparsest . Also , the adhesion and growth of HUVECs for the roughness surfaces were statistically signiﬁcantly better than that of smooth surface for both GRGD grafted and un - grafted surfaces , respectively . The viability for the growth of HUVECs on the tested surfaces analyzed by MTT assay also conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of the increased surface roughness . In conclusion , increased surface roughness of biomaterial surfaces even at 10 – 10 2 nm scale could enhance the adhesion and growth of HUVECs on roughness surfaces that could be useful for applications of tissue engineering . r 2003 Elsevier Ltd .

Introduction Surface - induced thrombosis is one of the major drawbacks that hampers the successful applications of some biomaterials such as polyurethane ( PU ) and chitosan in blood - contacting artiﬁcial medical devices . To provide a bioactive and biological – graft interface , in vitro endothelization on grafted surfaces such as polyurethane ( PU ) has given promising results in animal tests to improve their blood compatibility [ 1 – 3 ] . Various methods have been developed to support the seeding and growth of endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) on PU or other biomaterial surfaces such as surface modiﬁcations by plasma treatment and photochemically grafted GRGD peptide on a modiﬁed PU surface or chitosan surface by this group [ 4 – 6 ] .

All rights reserved . doi : 10 . 1016 / S0142 - 9612 ( 03 ) 00361 - 2 The above - mentioned surface modiﬁcations may be categorized as chemical or biological surface modiﬁca - tions to enhance endothelization on biomaterial sur - faces . On the other hand , modiﬁcations of physical properties of surfaces such as enhancing hydrophilic properties of surface , changing porosity of materials and increasing roughness of surface [ 7 – 9 ] may also enhance endothelization of biomaterials . With regard to roughness of the surface affecting the growth of different kinds of cells , some researchers reported that increased surface roughness by coarse sand - blasted could affect cell number and production of growth factors of osteoblast - like MG - 63 cells on the titanium surface [ 9 , 10 ] . Lampin et al . reported that increased roughness of the PMMA ( polymethylmetha - cylate ) surface by sandblasting PMMA with aluminum grain sizes of 50 – 150 m m could enhance cell adhesion and migration [ 11 ] . Here , we increased the roughness of the surface in nanometer scale by grafting different molecular weight / different lengths of PEG ( polyethylene glycol ) ( e . g . , PEG 1100 , 2000 and 5000 ) , a spacer , to the PU surface , a model biomaterial , namely PU - PEG mix . To investigate whether increasing the roughness of nanometer scale by random molecule distribution instead of microscale of roughness by mechanical sandblasting would affect cell adhesion and growth , we grew human endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) on different roughness of PU - PEG surfaces . To further investigate the possible role of nanoscale roughness on biological modiﬁcation or peptide - grafted surfaces , such as Arg – Gly – Asp ( RGD ) , a cell adhesion tri - peptide , the adhesion and growth of HUVECs was also studied on different roughness of GRGD - grafted PU - PEG surfaces . To graft GRGD on different roughness of PU - PEG surfaces , photochemical techniques based on phenyl azido chemistry have been applied . The technique has been applied to graft heparin or RGD - peptide to different biomaterial surfaces such as PU or polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) , respectively [ 5 , 6 , 12 ] . In general , heparin or RGD - peptides was ﬁrstly attached to water - soluble functional moiety to form phenyl azido - derivatized polymers or proteins , and then they were grafted to material substrates by UV irradiation [ 5 – 6 , 12 ] . Here , we applied a similar technique to graft Gly – Arg – Gly – Asp ( GRGD ) peptide on the PU - PEG mix surface by inducing photochemical reactions between the azido group and hydroxyl group of the PEG molecules as earlier report by this group [ 5 ] . Here , we characterized the roughness of the PU – PEG mix and GRGD - grafted PU - PEG mix surfaces ( PU - PEG mix - GRGD ) by an atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) while providing the images of the surfaces . In addition , we characterize the adhesion and growth of HUVECs on the surfaces by providing the morphology and viability of cells to evaluate the roles of roughness of surfaces on cell behaviors . 2 . Material and methods 2 . 1 . Preparing PU - PEG 2000 , PU - PEG mix , surfaces The procedures for preparing PU - PEG with PEG molecular weight ( MW ) of 2000 ( PU - PEG 2000 ) were the same as our earlier reports [ 5 , 13 ] . To prepare the PU - PEG mix surface , different MW / lengths of PEG molecules ( i . e . , PEG 1100 , 2000 and 5000 ) , purchased from Fluka Co . , with a molar ratio of 1 : 2 : 1 were well mixed , and grafted onto PU surfaces [ 13 ] to form a PU - PEG mix surface . 2 . 2 . Preparing PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD and PU - PEG mix - GRGD surfaces To further prepare GRGD - grafted PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG mix surfaces , the photochemical technique was applied as given in our earlier reports [ 5 , 6 ] . In general , GRGD ( MW 403 . 4 g ) and SANPAH ( MW 492 . 4 g ) were purchased from Pierce Chemical Corp . ( Rockford , IL , USA ) . To graft GRGD - SANPAH ( N - Succinimidyl - 6 - [ 4 0 - azido - 2 0 - nitrophenylamino ] - hexanoate ) on the sur - face of PU - PEG surfaces , 0 . 025 m of GRGD and SANPAH were ﬁrstly dissolved in distilled water and pure ethanol , respectively . Then , equivalent moles of above - mentioned GRGD and SANPAH solutions were gently mixed and reacted in a dark room at room temperature for 2 h to form phenyl azido - derivatized peptides . The ethanol containing GRGD - SANPAH solution was poured into the above - mentioned PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG mix ﬁlms . After the ﬁlms were air - dried , they were irradiated by ultraviolet light ( 290 – 370 nm ) for 4 min to induce photochemical ﬁxation of GRGD on the PU - PEG mix surfaces by a UV generator ( Model 68805 , ORIEL Instrument , Stratford , CT , USA ) . The ﬁlm was fully rinsed with distilled water to removed un - reacted reagents and then dried at room temperature . For a semi - quantitative analysis of the grafting efﬁciency of GRGD - SANPAH to chitosan ﬁlms , the above - mentioned distilled water , used for the washing of the samples , was collected , and further analyzed by an HPLC ( Jasco PU - 1580 , Kobe , Japan ) equipped with a C 18 reverse phase column ( # 201SP54 , 4 . 6 mm (cid:3) 25 cm ID , VyDAC Corp . , Hesperia , CA , USA ) at room temperature . For this analysis , 10 % acetonitrile dissolved in 0 . 1 % of triﬂuoroacetic acid ( TFA ) solution was used as the mobile phase with a 0 . 8 ml / min ﬂow rate , and the quantity of GRGD - SANPAH was detected by absorption intensity of wavelength at 254 nm that was analyzed with a built - in standard software of the HPLC . 2 . 3 . Surface characterization Contact angles for PU , PU - PEG 2000 , PU - PEG 5000 , PU - PEG 1100 and PU - PEG mix ﬁlms were measured by a ARTICLE IN PRESS T . - W . Chung et al . / Biomaterials 24 ( 2003 ) 4655 – 4661 4656 contact angle meter ( FACE CA - D , Kyowa Interface Science , G - Yu , Japan ) . The infrared spectra of the surfaces were detected by a Fourier transform infrared spectrum ( FTIR ) analyzer , collected at 4 - cm (cid:4) 1 resolu - tions , and analyzed with built - in standard software package ( Perkin - Elmer Spectrum One , Perkin - Elmer Co . , Norwalk , CT , USA ) . To determine different roughness of the surfaces , an atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Hitachi DI - 5000 , Hitachi Koki Co . Ltd , Japan ) was applied to scan ﬁve different areas of surface for each sample with an area and height of 4 m m 2 and 500 nm , respectively , and then to take the images of the surface in a tapping mode . Some of the PU - PEG mix surfaces were scanned with a large area ( 25 m m 2 ) for validation of the roughness measurements . To describe the roughness of the surface of the ﬁlms , the topography of the surface and the roughness parameter for the surface , R a ; which is the centerline average or the distance between the highest and the lowest point of the surface irregularities , were shown and calculated by built - in software ( Nanoscope IIIa , Digital Instrument , CA , USA ) . R a has also been applied to describe the roughness of the surface by another group [ 11 ] . 2 . 4 . Cell culture The cell culture procedures were the same as our earlier reports [ 5 – 6 ] . In general , the GRGD grafted or un - grafted different roughness PU - PEG ﬁlms were cut , sterilized with 70 % alcohol and dipped in HEPES ( n - 2 - hydroxyl - ethylpiperazine - n 0 - 2 - ethane sulfonic acid ) buf - fer for further sterilization with UV light for 2 days . After the ﬁlms were further rinsed with sterilized HEPES buffer , they were placed on the bottom of a 24 - well polystyrene tissue culture plate ( Falcon , USA ) covered with a sterilized Teﬂon ring to prevent ﬂoating . The cryopreserved human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were purchased from Cascade Biologics Inc . ( Lot # : 9C1020 , Portland , OR , USA ) . To obtain the second cycle of HUVEC , a vial of cryopreserved HUVEC purchased from the above company was ﬁrst de - frozen in a 37 (cid:5) C water bath . The number of cells in the vial was counted by a hematocytometer , and the cells were then diluted to a concentration of 1 . 25 (cid:3) 10 4 viable cells / ml to 25 cm 2 of cell culture ﬂasks ( Costar , San Diego , USA ) that containing medium - 200 ( Cascade Biologics Inc . , Portland , OR , USA ) supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 10 ng / ml epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and 1 % of antibiotic ( Gibco BRL Co . , Rockville , MD , USA ) for subculture , and the following cell culture experiments [ 6 ] . To study cell adhesion and growth on the modiﬁed and un - modiﬁed chitosan surfaces , 1 ml of EC suspensions harvested from three to four cycles of subculture with the above - mentioned cell density was taken and seeded onto a 24 - well polystyrene tissue culture plate covered with PU - PEG 2000 , PU - PEG mix , PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD and PU - PEG mix - GRGD , respectively . The EC culture wells were incubated at 37 (cid:5) C with 5 % CO 2 / 95 % of air and at approximately 90 % relative humidity for 36 h . After 36 h of incubation , the cells adhering to the ﬁlms were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , then incubated with 75 % alcohol at 4 (cid:5) C for 1 h . After the samples were washed with PBS , propidium iodine ( PI ) ( Sigma Chemicals , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , a dye for ﬂuorescence stain for nucleic acids of cells , was added to stain the cells for morphological observation [ 6 ] . The morphology of the cells on the ﬁlms was observed by a phase contrast microscope equipped with a ﬂuorescence light source ( Nikon TE - 100 , Tokyo , Japan ) , and photographs were taken with a CCD camera . In addition , the viability of the cells was determined by thiazolyl blue assay ( MTT reagent , Sigma Chemicals , St . Louis , MO , USA ) with minor modiﬁcation of Mosmann method [ 14 ] . 300 m l MTT solution was ﬁrstly incubated with the cells in wells of culture plates , two types of PU - PEG and PU - PEG - GRGD ﬁlms at 37 (cid:5) C for 4 h and then dimethyl sulfoxide solution ( DMSO , Sigma Che - micals , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was added to dissolve formazan crystals . The absorbance of formazan solu - tions obtained from the above - mentioned ﬁlms was measured by an ELISA microplate reader at 570 nm ( EL (cid:3) 800 , Bio - Tek Instruments , Inc . , Winooski , Ver - mont , USA ) [ 14 ] . For comparison , the absorbance of formazan solution measured from polystyrene cell culture well ( PS ) was assigned as a control group . The ratio of the differences in absorbance of the formazan solutions between the groups of PU - PEG mix or GRGD - grafted PU - PEG mix ﬁlm and the PS control to that of the PS control group was deﬁned as the relative cell growth rate . All calculations were analyzed by Sigmastat statistical software ( Jandel Science Corp . , San Rafael , CA , USA ) . Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated at 95 % of conﬁdence level or better . Data presented are mean 7 s . d . 3 . Results and discussion The schematic graphs for different roughness of PU - PEG 2000 , PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG mix - GRGD surfaces are shown ( Figs . 1a – c ) . The contact angles for the ﬁlms are also shown in Table 1 . The contact angle values for PU and PU - PEG 2000 were about the same as our earlier report [ 5 ] . In addition , the contact angles for PU - PEG surfaces increased with increasing molecule weight / chain length of PEG , which was similar to others [ 15 , 16 ] . Since the PU - PEG mix surface was prepared by mixing three different chain lengths of PEG molecules , the mean value of the contact angle for PU - PEG mix , which was within the maximum and minimum measurement range , ARTICLE IN PRESS T . - W . Chung et al . / Biomaterials 24 ( 2003 ) 4655 – 4661 4657 with a large standard deviation was reasonable . The contact angles for PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD , PU - PEG mix - GRGD would be similar to those for PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG mix as our earlier report [ 5 ] . The ATR - FTIR spectroscopy was performed for the ﬁlms to characterize GRGD grafted on the PU - PEG mix surface . The results of these functional groups such as the carboxyl group of GRGD grafted on PU - PEG surfaces were conﬁrmed and similar to our earlier reports [ 5 , 6 ] ( ﬁgure not shown ) . For example , there were absorption peaks at 963 and 1278 cm (cid:4) 1 which was attributed by carboxyl groups of CH 2 – CH 2 – COOH and COOH of aspartic acid . In addition , the semi - quantita - tive analysis of grafting efﬁciency of GRGD on the surfaces was carried out by analyzing the concentration of GRGD , by HPLC , of the washing solutions of UV - irradiated different roughness of PU - PEG surfaces . The concentration response peak at a retention time of 3 . 50 min as assigned for GRGD - SANPAH , and the intensity areas of GRGD for the washing solutions of PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD and PU - PEG mix - GRGD were much less than that of the initial grafting concentration [ 6 ] . The grafting efﬁciencies of GRGD - SANPAH to PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG mix surfaces were about 67 % for both surfaces . According to the grafting efﬁciencies , the surface densities for GRGD grafted to two different roughnesses of PU - PEG ﬁlms were about 42 nmole / cm 2 . Topographies of PU , PU - PEG 2000 , PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD , PU - PEG mix , PU - PEG mix - GRGD ﬁlms were observed by AFM and shown ( Fig . 2a – e ) Moreover , the roughness of the ﬁlms presented with R a values that was applied to describe the roughness of surface [ 10 ] are shown ( Table 2 ) . The image of the smooth PU surface is observed ( Fig . 2a ) that is consistent with the R a values for the surface ( e . g . , less than 2 nm ) . The R a value for PU - PEG mix is the largest among the tested ﬁlms that indicates the most roughness of the surface ( Table 2 ) . In addition , the R a values for PU - PEG mix - GRGD and PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD are little smaller but there is no statistical difference compared to those for PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG 2000 ﬁlms , respectively . Therefore , the GRGD - grafted procedure was not effectively affected by the roughness of surfaces signiﬁcantly . With regard to measurements for the roughness of the surface , the R a value for PU - PEG 2000 is the same order as that of the theoretically calculated chain length of PEG - 2000 ( e . g . , extended chain length = 22 . 8 nm ) grafted to a smooth PU surface . By means of the calculation , the experi - mental results hinted that the graft of PEG - 2000 to the PU surface was not so uniform if micrometer ( m m ) scale of area was counted but it is still reasonable to assume it to be relatively smooth for a large scale , for example , centimeter scale of area for cell culture . Moreover , it is noted that the scale of roughness for PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG mix - GRGD are about 20 nm larger than PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD , respectively , that is much less than the micro - scale of surface roughness fabricated by a sand - blasted technique on different surfaces by earlier groups [ 9 – 11 ] . The adhesion and proliferation of HUVECs on the PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG mix - GRGD ﬁlms were more pronounced than that of the PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD , respectively . Micrographs of HU - VECs growth on PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG mix - GRGD were shown after cells were stained ( Fig . 3a and b ) . In ARTICLE IN PRESS Fig . 1 .

Chung et al . / Biomaterials 24 ( 2003 ) 4655 – 4661 4658 general , the adhered cells on the PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG mix - GRGD ﬁlms were denser than less roughness of PU - PEG 2000 and PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD ﬁlms , respec - tively . Furthermore , denser and more spread of cells of GRGD grafted surfaces than un - grafted ones were also observed as in our earlier reports [ 5 , 6 ] . Since MTT assay can reﬂect the level of cell metabolism [ 14 ] , the viability for the growth rate of HUVECs determined by ARTICLE IN PRESS Fig . 2 . Topographies of different roughness of surfaces with an area of 4 m m 2 were observed by AFM and shown : ( a ) PU , ( b ) PU - PEG 2000 , ( c ) PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD , ( d ) PU - PEG mix , ( e ) PU - PEG mix - GRGD ﬁlms . Among the topographies , the PU surface was the smoothest while the surface of PU - PEG mix was the roughest . Table 2 Values of roughness parameter , R a ; for the surfaces obtained from AFM measurements Materials PU PU - PEG 2000 PU - PEG (cid:1) mix PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD PU - PEG mix - GRGD Roughness R a ( nm ) 1 . 53 7 0 . 20 20 . 10 7 7 . 87 39 . 79 7 10 . 48 18 . 63 7 5 . 30 34 . 58 7 9 . 89 The R a values showed that the PU surface was the smoothest while PU - PEG mix was the roughest among the tested surfaces ( data presented are mean 7 SD , n ¼ 3 ; (cid:1) : n ¼ 4 ) . T . - W . Chung et al . / Biomaterials 24 ( 2003 ) 4655 – 4661 4659 the assay by measuring the absorbance of the formazan solution at 570 nm has been widely applied [ 5 – 6 , 17 – 18 ] . Here , the results for MTT assay for viability of growth of HUVECs on the tested ﬁlms are shown with the relative cell growth rates ( Fig . 4 ) . The absorbance values of the formazan solutions for cell growth on the PS well ( i . e . , the control group ) and the different roughness of PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG mix - GRGD ﬁlms were 0 . 048 7 0 . 003 ( n ¼ 6 ) , 0 . 028 7 0 . 003 ( n ¼ 6 ) and 0 . 0033 7 0 . 002 ( n ¼ 6 ) , respectively . It was also noted that GRGD grafted on PU - PEG mix and PU - PEG 2000 ﬁlms enhanced cell adhesion and growth on the ﬁlms compared to that on un - grafted ones ( P o 0 : 05 and P o 0 : 001 ; n ¼ 6 ; respectively ) . Moreover , there was a signiﬁcant enhancement ( e . g . , about 35 % increases , P o 0 : 001 ; n ¼ 6 ) for cell adhesion on PU - PEG mix ﬁlm compared to that for the PU - PEG 2000 ﬁlm . In addition , there was also a signiﬁcant enhancement for cell adhesion on PU - PEG mix - GRGD than that of PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD ( P o 0 : 04 ; n ¼ 6 ) . The results of enhanced cell adhesion and growth on PU - PEG 2000 - GRGD and PU - PEG mix - GRGD surfaces compared with that on GRGD un - grafted surfaces , respectively , were consistent with our earlier reports and reports of others [ 3 , 5 – 6 , 12 ] . It is well known that RGD tri - peptide is the minimal cell recognizable sequence for many adhesion plasma and extracellular proteins including the von Willebrand factor , ﬁbrinectin and collagen [ 19 ] . In addition , the RGD tri - peptide plays a crucial role in mediating cell attachment and subse - quently spreading [ 19 – 20 ] . Therefore , the enhancement of HUVECs adhesion and growth on GRGD - grafted surfaces compared with un - grafted ones in this study was reasonable . Our results show that the effect of nano - scale of surface roughness in enhancing cell adhesion and growth on its surface are valid in both GRGD - grafted and un - grafted cases ( Table 2 ) . It indicates that the roughness of the surface , a physical factor , can alternate cell behavior such as adhesion on matrix even at the GRGD peptide ( or biological ) domination surface . More interestingly , the scale of roughness is only 10 1 – 10 2 nanometer ( nm ) applied in this study instead of 10 1 – 10 2 m m , accomplished by other groups [ 9 – 11 ] . By means of earlier studies , Lampin et al . reported that the effect of roughness of PMMA surfaces in enhancing cell adhesion might be due to triggering of sub - conﬂuent cells to secrete extra - cellular proteins which allowed better anchorage of cells to their substratum [ 11 ] while others reported that the roughness of the titanium surface could modulate the product of cytokine and growth factor of cells , but reduced cell numbers [ 10 ] . Although the results for the above studies showed different effects for cell growth on the roughness surfaces [ 9 – 11 ] , different tested material surfaces ( e . g . , titanium and PMMA , respectively ) and types of cells ( e . g . , osteoblast - like MG - 63 cells and chicken embryo ARTICLE IN PRESS ( a ) ( b ) Fig . 3 .

The above - mentioned factors reported by earlier reports [ 9 – 11 ] might play a role in enhancing the growth of HUVECs in this study although a different cell type was used compared to theirs . However , the details of the mechanisms for enhancing HUVECs’ adhesion and growth by increased roughness of surface in nm scale still need to be further investigated . By means of the study with PU as a model , we conclude that increased roughness of surface even at 10 1 – 10 2 nm scales can enhance HUVECs’ adhesion and growth on its surface for both GRGD - grafted and un - grafted surfaces that can be further applied in tissue engineering .
