The most common and severe form of CCC can be related to ventricular abnormalities , such as heart failure , arrhythmias , heart blocks , thromboembolic events and sudden death . Therefore , in this study , we proposed to evaluate the anti - angiogenic activity of a recombinant protein from T . cruzi named P21 ( rP21 ) and the potential impact of the native protein on CCC . Our data suggest that the anti - angiogenic activity of rP21 depends on the protein’s direct interaction with the CXCR4 receptor . This capacity is likely related to the modulation of the expression of actin and angiogenesis - associated genes . Thus , our results indicate that T . cruzi P21 is an attractive target for the development of innovative therapeutic agents against CCC . Chagas disease ( also known as American trypanosomiasis ) is caused by the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and affects 8 – 10 million people worldwide being endemic in Latin America where approximately 109 mil - lion individuals are at risk 1 . Chronic Chagasic Cardiomyopathy ( CCC ) is possibly the most important form of Chagas disease ; it is estimated that 10 – 30 % of chronic patients develop this clinical manifestation 2 . CCC is char - acterized by morbidity and early mortality in the most productive age group , which has created an extensive economic and social burden in endemic areas 3 – 5 . The most common and severe form of CCC can be related to ventricular abnormalities such as heart failure , arrhythmias , heart blocks , thromboembolic events and sudden death . It is estimated that 20 , 000 deaths occur annually in endemic areas due to CCC complications . Moreover , refractory heart failure and thromboembolism are the most important causes of death 6 . These clinical manifestations have contributed to Chagas disease becom - ing one of the most important causes of heart disease 7 , 8 . 1 Laboratório de Tripanosomatídeos , Departamento de Imunologia , Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas , Universidade Federal de Uberlândia , MG , Brasil . 2 Laboratório de Bioquímica e Toxinas Animais , Instituto de Genética e Bioquímica , Universidade Federal de Uberlândia , MG , Brasil . 3 Center of Toxins , Immune Response and Cell Signaling ( CeTICS ) , Instituto Butantan , São Paulo , São Paulo , Brasil . 4 Laboratório de Patologia Molecular e Biotecnologia do Centro de Referência Nacional em Dermatologia Sanitária / Hanseníase , Faculdade de Medicina , Universidade Federal de Uberlândia , MG , Brasil . 5 Laboratório de Osteoimunologia e Imunologia dos Tumores , Departamento de Imunologia , Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas , Universidade Federal de Uberlândia , MG , Brasil . 6 Departamento de Microbiologia Imunologia e Parasitologia , Escola Paulista de Medicina , Universidade Federal de São Paulo , SP , Brasil .

However , several studies have shown that CCC etiology is likely the result of a number of factors that involve the T . cruzi strain , including parasite - dependent myocardial damage 9 , persistent parasitemia 10 – 12 , immune - mediated myocardial injury ( auto - immunity ) 13 and host - related genetic factors 14 . Our research group has recently characterized a recombinant protein from T . cruzi named P21 ( rP21 ) as an attractive therapeutic target for CCC treatment . It has been shown that rP21 can recruit immune cells , induce myeloperoxidase and interleukin ( IL ) - 4 production and decrease blood vessel formation compared to the con - trols in vitro and in vivo 15 . Here we aimed to investigate the anti - angiogenic activity of rP21 in order to get novel insight into the potential impact of the native protein on the onset of chagasic cardiomyopathy . Results and Discussion Anti - angiogenic activity of rP21 depends on its direct interaction with endothelial cells . Our previous studies showed that a murine endothelial cell line ( tEnd ) treated with different concentrations of rP21 did not exhibit altered cell viability or adhesion to a thin layer of extracellular matrix , but vessel formation was inhibited after 18 hours of incubation 15 . However , an intriguing question was raised : how does P21 , a parasite - de - rived molecule , significantly interfere with the angiogenesis process ? Therefore , in this study we aimed to gain insight into the mechanism by which rP21 inhibits angiogenesis . Thus , we verified that the anti - angiogenic activ - ity of rP21 was time - dependent and was observed at 24 , 48 and 72 h ( Fig . 1A ) . The significant decreases in the number of vessels in the control group at 48 and 72 h were due to the intense cellular proliferation that closed the vessels . Moreover , we evaluated the influence of rP21 upon extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components and observed that the protein was not able to promote degradation of bovine fibrinogen , Matrigel or fibronectin compared to the control group ( untreated ) , regardless of the protein quantity ( Fig . 1B , C ) . In addition , to confirm whether the anti - angiogenic activity of rP21 occurs by a direct interaction with ECM components or by interaction with endothelial cells ( ECs ) we incubated the tEnd cells with rP21 and the cells were then washed out or not then plated on a thin ECM ( Matrigel ) layer . Our results showed that in both situations rP21 was able to inhibit the angiogenesis process indicating that this protein directly interacts with ECs ( Fig . 1D ) . ECM regulates different cellular processes including growth , migration , differentiation , survival , homeosta - sis , and morphogenesis . ECM consists of a large variety of matrix macromolecules such as collagens , elastin , fibronectin ( FN ) , laminins , glycoproteins , proteoglycans ( PGs ) , and glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) that associate with each other to build the complex three - dimensional matrix network 16 , 17 . In this sense , Matrigel ( a solubilized basement membrane - like composite from Engelbreth - Holm - Swarm sarcoma ) was used as a surrogate for ECM and is mainly composed of laminin , type IV collagen , nidogen and heparan sulfate proteoglycans 18 . However , rP21 showed no detectable proteolytic activity on the matrix components ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Although rP21 did not interfere with EC adhesion or cellular viability 15 and did not exhibit proteolytic activity on ECM components , this protein strongly inhibits vessel formation . This anti - angiogenic effect of rP21 could be explained by other mechanisms such as a direct interaction of rP21 with ECs . To test this hypothesis , we showed that rP21 binds to ECs and is internalized by these cells ( Fig . 1E ) . These data suggest that the rP21 - EC interaction can initiate a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in decreased vessel formation . The rP21 - CXCR4 interaction decreases blood vessel formation and inhibits EC prolifera - tion . Our previous studies showed that rP21 has the capacity to bind to CXC receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ; CD184 ) , enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and actin polymerization 19 . Therefore , we performed additional experi - ments to gain insights into the rP21 - CXCR4 interaction in ECs . First , we showed that CXCR4 was highly expressed on the surface of tEnd cells ( endothelial cells ) ( Fig . 2A ) . Then , to assess whether the rP21 - mediated inhibition of vessel formation depends on its binding to the CXCR4 receptor , tEnd cells were treated with a receptor - specific antagonist , AMD3100 ( CXCR4 inhibitor ) . We observed that blocking CXCR4 signaling path - way and subsequent treatment with or without rP21 did not inhibit vessel formation compared to the other groups ( Fig . 2B , C ) . Therefore , we suggest that the anti - angiogenic activity of rP21 depends on its interaction with CXCR4 . CXCL12 [ stromal cell - derived factor - 1 ( SDF - 1 ) ] is a chemokine and primarily binds to CXCR4 . CXCL12 secretion is associated with tissue damage such as heart infarction and focal ischemia to promote vessel repair . CXCR4 is expressed by T - lymphocytes , B - lymphocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , and endothelial and epithelial cells . This receptor is widely expressed by ECs in damaged tissues such as injured carotid arteries and atheroscle - rotic plaques during pathological processes 20 , 21 . It is known that pro - angiogenic CXCR4 + cells are recruited to damaged tissues along a CXCL12 gradient to promote the re - vascularization of the injured areas demonstrating the importance of the CXCL12 / CXCR4 pathway during inflammatory processes 22 . A hallmark of CCC is an intense inflammatory process that is clinically persistent in indeterminate and chronic chagasic patients and is essentially characterized by myocarditis 23 . The prevalence of myocarditis cor - relates with the severity of clinical heart failure such as vasospasms , decreased blood flow , myocardial ischemia , coronary angiography , impairment of endothelium - dependent coronary vasodilatation , platelet thrombi and increased platelet aggregation 24 – 28 . The micro - vascular ischemia observed during CCC may be partially explained by the active role of P21 . Intracellular , trapped parasites may constantly secrete P21 that can gain access to the extracellular space and bind to CXCR4 + ECs from the heart that would lose their capacity to promote re - vascularization in situ contributing to disease progression . This hypothesis is partially supported by several independent studies showing that the persistence of T . cruzi is directly associated with CCC pathogenesis . For example , Andrade et al . 29 and Silva et al . 30 reported that an enhanced parasite burden exacerbates the cardiomy - opathy course . Moreover , Añes et al . 31 showed that intact amastigotes are able to survive and multiply inside host heart tissue during the chronic phase contributing to disease progression . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 44978 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep44978 The CXCR4 - CXCL12 axis is widely known to promote EC multiplication 32 – 35 . In this context , we proposed to assess the influence of rP21 on EC proliferation . EC cell growth curve showed a decrease in all time points of rP21 treatment ( Fig . 3A ) . Moreover , MTT assay demonstrated that while the combination of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and basic fibroblastic growth factor ( bFGF ) saturated EC proliferation capacity , rP21 inhibited EC prolif - eration at 24 , 48 and 72 h post - treatment ( Fig . 3B ) . This anti - proliferative activity of rP21 was confirmed by cell cycle analysis where we observed a significant decrease in the 2N cell number and an increase in the number of cell in S phase up to 72 h ( Fig . 3C ) , raising the possibility that the anti - proliferative activity of rP21 can be related to replicative stress . Taken together , these results suggest that rP21 antagonizes CXCL12 activity . The subsequent mechanisms by which rP21 inhibits cell proliferation will be thoroughly evaluated in future studies from our research group . rP21 induces actin cytoskeleton polymerization and modulates the expression of actin - related genes in endothelial cells . Actin is a major cytoskeletal component of ECs and is a well - studied cytoskeletal element that controls angiogenesis 36 . The actin cytoskeleton orchestrates various steps in both physiological and Figure 1 . Anti - angiogenic activity of rP21 depends on its direct interaction with endothelial cells .

( D ) tEnds cells pre - incubated with rP21 were washout with PBS and centrifuged .

Thus , the actin network and its associated proteins integrate with and respond to key signaling pathways known to regulate angiogenesis 39 . To investigate the influence of rP21 on the actin cytoskeleton of ECs , we treated tEnd cells with different con - centrations of rP21 and observed that rP21 significantly increased F - actin levels in ECs compared to the controls ( not treated ) using fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 4A , B ) . The effect of rP21 on the F - actin level may be due to an increase in the rate of actin polymerization , a decrease in actin depolymerization or both . To assess which of these processes are regulated by rP21 , we performed an F - actin recovery assay using cytochalasin - D ( CytD ) . tEnd cells were treated with CytD ( 1 . 5 μ M ) for 40 min to inhibit actin subunit assembly followed by a recovery period in the presence or absence of rP21 . We observed that rP21 increased the recovery rate of the actin filaments compared to the control groups . Thus , these results showed that rP21 has a remarkable capacity to promote actin polymeri - zation in accordance with our previous studies 19 ( Fig . 4C ) . The rP21 - treated tEnd cells had markedly different actin cytoskeleton morphology compared to the control cells . ECs exhibited long , thick actin stress fibers that were aligned along cell longitudinal axis , and the plasma membrane was aligned with the bright phalloidin staining . In contrast , control cells had wispy , short actin fila - ment bundles , and their plasma membrane was weakly stained with phalloidin . Moreover , rP21 - treated tEnd cells exhibited sites of lamellipodial membrane protrusions enriched in F - actin compared to the control group ( Fig . 4D - white arrows ) . To gain insights into the direct effect of rP21 on actin cytoskeleton dynamics , tEnd cells were seeded into 24 - well plates and incubated with rP21 or culture medium ( control group ) for 24 and 72 h and actin cytoskeleton - related gene expression was analyzed . rP21 modulated the expression levels of 7 important genes involved in a number of different biological effects such as cell motility , migration , morphogenesis , cell - cell inter - actions and cell - ECM component interactions . rP21 up - regulated the expression of actin filament - associated protein 1 - like 1 ( AFAP1L1 ) , cofilin , cortactin , fascin , profilin - 1 and down - regulated the expression of ezrin and actin filament - associated protein 110 kilodaltons ( kDa ) in size ( AFAP - 110 / AFAP1 ) at 24 h . Interestingly , at 72 h Figure 2 . rP21 - CXCR4 interaction decreases blood vessel formation . ( A ) tEnd cells showed increased CXCR4 expression on their surface .

Bars : 20 μ m . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 5 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 44978 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep44978 of rP21 treatment we observed a turnover in gene expression with the exception of cofilin , profilin - 1 , ezrin and cortactin ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , rP21 did not alter the expression of gelsolin , moesin and actin - related proteins 2 and 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex genes ( data not shown ) . In this context , we examined whether changes in the mechanical properties of the substrate could promote the same effects on the expression of genes related to the actin cytoskeleton in rP21 - treated ECs . Thus , tEnd cells were plated in 24 - well plates that had been previously coated with a thin layer of ECM . After 24 and 72 h of treat - ment with or without rP21 , total RNA was extracted and analyzed by real - time PCR ( RT - qPCR ) . We observed different gene expression profiles between two - dimensional ( 2 - D ) and three - dimensional ( 3 - D ) cell cultures . At 24 h of treatment in 3 - D cultures , rP21 promoted a slight down - regulation of AFAP1 and ARP2 expression and up - regulated gelsolin and moesin expression . Curiously , after 72 h rP21 only promoted down - regulated AFAP1 , AFAP1L1 , ezrin and moesin expression ( Fig . 5B ) . Cofilin , cortactin , fascin , profilin - 1 and ARP3 gene expression levels were not modulated by rP21 in the 3 - D culture model ( data not shown ) . Dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in a variety of cellular events and involves a number of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) including capping , branching , severing , sequestering , and cross - linking proteins 40 . Cofilin is a small ubiquitous protein that is able to bind both monomeric ( G ) and filamentous ( F ) actin . The F - actin - severing protein cofilin is a key player that regulates the dynamics of actin polymerization and depo - lymerization in migrating cells 41 – 45 . Several studies have shown that cofilin is required to determine the direction of cell migration through actin polymerization - based protrusions 42 , 46 , 47 . Cortactin , another ABP , is located in the cytoplasm of cells and is associated with the polymerization and rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton , mainly at the periphery of the cellular cortex 48 , 49 . This protein actively triggers lamellipodia , protrusions of the plasma membrane that are characterized by high F - actin levels . Similar to cofilin , cortactin is also involved in cell motil - ity 50 . Fascin is an actin cross - linking protein located in the actin - rich protrusions of ECs and is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal scaffolds during cell adhesion and migration 51 . AFAP1 and AFAP1L1 are members of the AFAP family of proteins ; as adaptor proteins ( non - enzymatic proteins ) associated with the assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton 52 , 53 , these proteins affect cell adhesion , invasion and motility 54 . Snyder et al . 55 showed that AFAP1 and AFAP1L1 overexpression promoted lamellipodia formation in the absence of extracellular signals . Moreover , these results indicate that AFAP1L1 , like AFAP1 , is associated with actin - stress fiber formation . In their report , the authors showed that AFAP1L1 but not AFAP1 binds cortactin to form a complex . Thus , these proteins may have the capacity to interact with differ - ent proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Ezrin , radixin and moesin , which form the ERM protein family , act as linkers between the plasma membrane and the cortical actin filaments and are involved in many Figure 3 . rP21 inhibits EC proliferation and interferes in cell cycle . ( A ) Growth curve of tEnd cells in the presence of rP21 showed a reduction in cell number . ( B ) rP21 inhibited EC proliferation at 24 , 48 and 72 h post - treatment and ( C ) promoted a significant decrease in the 2N cell number and increased the cell number in S phase at 72 h post - treatment . Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation . Significant differences were determined using one - way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test ( A – C ) . Differences were considered significant when p < 0 . 05 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 44978 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep44978 physiological functions including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , control of cell shape , adhesion , lamellipo - dia formation , motility and modulation of signal transduction pathways . Ezrin plays a key role in the actin - based cellular functions required for cell locomotion that are important in angiogenesis 56 – 58 . Literature shows that different ABPs play critical roles in regulating the complex series of signaling events in ECs to shape the changes that occur during migration and angiogenesis . In this context , the results of our 2 - D cell cultures showed that rP21 is able to up - regulate the expression of genes that are required for actin polymerization , stress fiber formation and migration such as cofilin , cortactin , AFAP1 , AFAP1L1 , and fascin . However , when gene expression levels from 3 - D cell cultures were determined essentially the very genes that were overexpressed in 2 - D cultures did not show altered expression or were down - regulated by the rP21 treatment , with the excep - tion of gelsolin and moesin at 24 h , which were slightly up - regulated . Interestingly , ezrin ( ERM protein family ) expression was significantly down - regulated in both cell culture systems . The negative modulation of ezrin may be directly related to the inhibition of blood vessel formation . This hypothesis is corroborated by Zhao et al . 59 that showed that silencing of the ezrin gene in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in vitro suppressed migration and angiogenesis . It is known that the cytoskeletal organization within ECs in 2 - D cell cultures is distinct from that in 3 - D cultures 36 , 59 – 63 . Growing evidence from 2 - D model systems has suggested that mechanical substrates ( i . e . , rigid glass or polystyrene substrates ) promote changes in migration , proliferation , differentiation and cell shape . However , it remains unclear whether these physiological processes may be generalized to 3 - D cultures or in vivo systems 59 , 60 , 64 . It has clearly been shown that ECs extend sprouts into an intact 3 - D ECM whereas ECs form a thin monolayer upon a mechanical substrate . Therefore , ECs behave differently when grown in 3 - D cultures compared to 2 - D cultures 36 . In this sense , the differences in gene expression profiles observed in our data may be due changes in the matrix composition that can directly or indirectly influence myosin - driven , actin - mediated contractility , cell motility , cell - cell interactions and / or intracellular signaling pathways 61 . rP21 modulates expression of angiogenesis - associated genes . To assess the effect of rP21 on gene expression profiles of pro - and anti - angiogenic molecules , tEnd cells were plated in 24 - well plates that had been previously coated with a thin layer of extracellular matrix ( 3 - D system ) or not ( 2 - D system ) and incubated with rP21 or culture medium ( control group ) for 24 and 72 h . After 24 h of treatment in 2 - D culture , rP21 up - regulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) and soluble fms - like tyrosine kinase 1 ( sFlt - 1 ) . However , rP21 did not alter vascular endothelial growth factor receptor - 1 / fms - like tyrosine kinase ( VEGFR1 / Flt1 ) and vas - cular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGFA ) expression . At 72 h , rP21 continued to up - regulate sFlt - 1 expression . Interestingly , rP21 promoted a positive modulation of VEGFA expression and did not influence MMP9 and Flt - 1 Figure 4 . rP21 induces actin cytoskeleton polymerization in ECs .

In 3 - D cell cultures , rP21 increased the expression levels of sFlt - 1 at 24 h and MMP9 , sFlt - 1 , and VEGFA at 72 h and decreased the expression levels of VEGFA at 24 h and Flt - 1 at 72 h ( Fig . 6B ) . Angiogenesis is known to be controlled by the balance between various pro - and anti - angiogenic signals . MMP9 is an enzyme expressed in many cell types , including ECs , and has the capacity to degrade many molecules of the ECM . Several studies have shown that this metalloproteinase is implicated in the pro - angiogenic process in various ways 65 – 68 . However , the role of MMP9 during angiogenesis remains uncertain 69 . VEGFA belongs to the mammalian platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) family and acts as a potent , mul - tifunctional cytokine that induces colony formation by recruiting mature subsets of cells . It also plays an active role in the regulation of the physiological and pathological growth of blood vessels formed during angiogenic and vasculogenic processes 70 . VEGFA binds to VEGFR1 ( Flt - 1 ) with an affinity that is approximately 10 - fold higher than that of Flk - 1 / KDR ( VEGFR2 ) 71 . VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are members of the VEGFR tyrosine kinase ( TK ) family and are highly expressed in ECs . Flt - 1 is alternatively spliced to produce both a membrane - localized and Figure 5 . rP21 modulates the expression of actin - related genes in ECs .

Shibuya and Claesson - Welsh 71 showed that VEGFR1 - null mice exhibited overgrowth and dysmorphogenesis of blood vessels which suggests that Flt - 1 is a negative regulator of angiogenesis during embryonic development . Takeda et al . 72 also revealed the negative regulatory role of Flt - 1 , as knockout mice exhibited embryonic lethality due to the overgrowth of ECs and blood vessel dysfunction . In addition , Amano et al . 73 showed that a knockout mouse lacking the Flt - 1 intracellular TK domain exhibited impaired angiogenesis after hind limb ischemia indicating that Flt - 1 signaling is essential for ischemia - related re - vascularization . Furthermore , Murdoch et al . 74 showed that the induction of sFlt - 1 expression is relevant to the recovery of suppressed blood flow following hind limb ischemia . It is known that sFlt - 1 retains high affinity for VEGFA 75 and can trap VEGFA to prevent it from binding to VEGFRs . These results suggest that soluble Flt - 1 modulates the amount of VEGFA 76 and inhibits VEGFA activity without affecting the intracellular signaling path - ways of VEGFRs 73 . Thus , Flt - 1 negatively regulates angiogenesis through its extracellular domain and positively regulates angiogenesis through its tyrosine kinase domain . According to the results of the 3 - D cellular culture system , we suggest that the anti - angiogenic activity of rP21 at 24 h is related to the up - regulation of sFlt - 1 expression and the negative modulation of VEGFA . However , at 72 h we observed a decrease in sFlt - 1 expression and increase in VEGFA and MMP9 expression in rP21 - treated ECs . Interestingly , at this time point we observed that rP21 strongly down - regulated Flt - 1 expression that may be related to the negative regulation of angiogenesis in agreement with the studies mentioned above . In this sense , the initial inhibition of angiogenesis by rP21 at 24 h could explain the increased sFlt - 1 levels and the continued inhibition of angiogenesis at 72 h is likely related to the down - regulation of Flt - 1 . In the 2 - D system , rP21 posi - tively regulated the pro - and anti - angiogenic signals . However , it is known that the cells have different behaviors that depend on the conditions of the cell culture model system . In order to support our gene expression results , we performed immunoblotting analysis of ezrin and Flt - 1 protein expression in 2 - D or 3 - D cultured cells treated or not with rP21 . Our results showed decreased expression of ezrin in 2 - D cultured cells treated with rP21 ( Fig . 7A ) . Also , we observed a significant decrease in Flt - 1 protein content from 3 - D cells previously treated with rP21 ( Fig . 7B ) . Potential P21 - mediated mechanism during CCC pathogenesis . Combining our findings and the current literature , we hypothesize that an anti - angiogenic mechanism is triggered by P21 during CCC onset and progression . We propose that P21 is continuously secreted to the extracellular space by intracellular amas - tigotes located in cardiac fibers that induces leukocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation and up - regulates Figure 6 . rP21 modulates the expression of angiogenesis - associated genes .

It is known that IL - 4 induces macrophages to acquire alternative ( M2 ) activation that is char - acterized by increased production of sFlt - 1 ( anti - angiogenic molecule ) 77 . Moreover , we believe that P21 has the capacity to bind to CXCR4 + ECs from the heart . P21 - sensitized ECs would lose their capacity to promote re - vascularization in situ through a cascade of intracellular events such as inhibition of EC proliferation , sFlt - 1 overexpression , and down - regulation of Flt - 1 , ezrin , AFAP1 , AFAP1L1 and moesin , that could partially explain the functional and structural micro - vascular abnormalities observed in CCC 13 ( Fig . 8 ) .

Cell cycle was analyzed in a FACSCantoII ( BD ) and the data were obtained using FlowJo software ( version 7 . 6 . 3 ) . Figure 8 . Potential P21 - mediated mechanism during CCC pathogenesis . P21 is continuously secreted to the extracellular space by intracellular amastigotes located in cardiac fibers and induces leukocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation and up - regulates IL - 4 expression . IL - 4 induces macrophages to acquire alternative ( M2 ) activation that is characterized by increased production of sFlt - 1 ( anti - angiogenic molecule ) . Moreover , P21 - sensitized CXCR4 + ECs would lose their capacity to promote in situ re - vascularization through a cascade of intracellular events such as inhibition of EC proliferation , sFlt - 1 overexpression , and down - regulation of Flt - 1 , ezrin , AFAP1 , AFAP1L1 and moesin . PCBT have drawn the figure . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 11 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 44978 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep44978 F - actin staining and actin recovery assay . F - actin accumulation and distribution were determined as described 87 . tEnd cells were seeded at a density of 2 . 5 × 10 4 cells / coverslip in 24 - well micro - plates . After adhesion , cells were treated with different rP21 concentrations ( 20 , 40 , and 80 μ g / mL ) or culture medium ( control group ) for 90 min at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Then , cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and covers - lips washed three times with PBS . Cells were incubated with TRITC - conjugated phalloidin ( diluted 1 : 500 in PGN - 0 . 01 % saponin solution ) and DAPI ( diluted 1 : 500 in PGN + saponin ) for 1 h to label F - actin and nuclei , respectively . F - actin recovery experiment was performed as previously described 87 , 88 . tEnd cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 4 cells / coverslip in 24 - well micro - plates . After adhesion , cells were treated with 1 . 5 μ M cytochalasin - D ( a pharmacological inhibitor of actin subunit assembly at the filament barbed ends ) for 40 minutes to induce actin disassembly , followed by a 90 min recovery period in the presence of rP21 ( 40 μ g / mL ) or culture medium ( control group ) , during which F - actin would be re - assembled . Then , cells were submitted to the same labeling conditions described above . In both experiments , the coverslips were mounted on glass slides and images captured with a 63 × oil immersion objective using an inverted fluorescence microscope ( Zeiss Axiovert 200 M ) . Digital images were analyzed using confocal fluorescence microscopy software ( Zeiss , LSM 510 Meta , Germany ) and the mean F - actin fluorescence was determined by setting a high threshold in ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , USA ) 88 . Gene expression . For the real - time PCR experiments , tEnd cells ( 1 × 10 4 cells / well ) were seeded in 24 - well micro - plates that had previously been coated with a thin ECM ( 3 - D cell culture system ) or not ( 2 - D cell culture system ) . Cells were then incubated with rP21 ( 40 μ g / mL ) or culture medium ( control group ) for 24 and 72 h . Total RNA was extracted using a RiboZol ™ Plus RNA Purification Kit ( Amaresco ) and a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) was used for reverse transcription according to the manufactur - ers’ instructions . Quantitative RT - PCR was performed using an ABI 7300 system ( Applied Biosystems ) and SDS v1 . 4 . 1 Software ( Applied Biosystems ) was used to analyze the received data . Reaction consisted of 5 μ L of SYBR ® Green PCR Master Mix ( 2X ) ( Applied Biosystems ) , 10 μ M forward and reverse primers ( 0 . 5 μ L F + 0 . 5 μ L R ) , 4 μ L of nuclease - free water , and 2 μ L of cDNA ( 125 ng / μ L ) in a total volume of 12 μ L per reaction / sample . The following thermal cycling protocol was used , as recommended by the manufacturer : 95 °C for 10 min , 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles . The cycles were followed by a melting curve analysis at 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 1 min . Primer sequences were designed using sequence alignments obtained from GenBank ( NIH / NCBI ) based on the published RNA sequences ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Data were normalized using Beta - 2 microglobulin ( β 2M ) as a housekeeping gene and then analyzed via the comparative threshold cycle ( C T ) method to calcu - late fold changes in expression in rP21 - treated groups compared to the control group where ∆ C T = the C T of gene of interest minus the C T of B2m and ∆ ∆ C T = ∆ C T of the rP21 - treated groups minus the ∆ C T of culture medium - treated groups . The fold changes in gene expression for the rP21 - treated groups were then calculated as 2 ∆∆ CT . All real - time experiments were performed with biological and technical triplicates . Immunoblotting analysis . To determine protein expression , tEnd cells were seeded in 24 - well micro - plates that had previously been coated with a thin ECM ( 3 - D cell culture system ) or not ( 2 - D cell culture system ) .

Following PBS washes , cells were harvested in RIPA ( Radioimmunoprecipitation ) Lysis Buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) containing 200 mM PMSF ( phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride ) , protease inhibitor cocktail and 100 mM sodium orthovanadate . After sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and electropho - retic protein transfer , the membrane was incubated with monoclonal anti - Ezrin ( Sigma - Aldrich / E 8897 ) and VEGFR - 1 / Flt - 1 antibody ( R & D Systems / AF471 ) ( gifts from Professor Ricardo José Giordano , Universidade de São Paulo , Brazil ) followed by horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Immunoreactive signals were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) , and densitome - try performed using UVIBAND image quantification software . Loading controls of extracts were checked with anti - actin antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Statistical analysis . Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation of experiments performed at least three times in triplicate . All data were first checked for normal distribution . Significance differences were determined by one - way ANOVA , Tukey’s multiple comparisons test and Student’s t - test ( two - sided ) for the parametric data or the Mann - Whitney test for nonparametric data according to the experimental design ( GraphPad Prism Software version 6 . 01 ) . Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0 . 05 . References 1 . Nunes , M . C . , Dones , W . , Morillo , C . A . , Encina , J . J . & Ribeiro , A . L .
