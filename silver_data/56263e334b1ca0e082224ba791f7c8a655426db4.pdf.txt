The present research is focused on the consequences of objectification in the occupational domain . The main goals were : a ) investigating the effects of objectification on the perception of men’s and women’s competence and pay ; and b ) investigating the effects of objectification on the perception of men and women as suitable for high - versus low - status jobs . Results showed that objectification does not affect the perception of competence , but increases the estimated pay . For high - status jobs , the effect of objectification interacts with gender , increasing women’s fit for a masculine job and decreasing men’s fit for a feminine occupation . Finally , objectification increases the suitability for low - status jobs , and this is particularly true for women holding service - oriented professions . Implications are discussed . Keywords : gender , objectification , occupational domain , perceived competence , experimental design . Men and women at work 3 The Objectification framework Literally , objectification refers to perceiving a person as an object . According to Fredrickson and Roberts ( 1997 ) , there is a great deal of evidence suggesting that women are largely objectified in contemporary Western countries . When objectified , women are reduced to the status of “mere instruments” available for visual inspection , evaluation , and the pleasure of others ( Bartky , 1990 , p . 26 ) . The body is seen as a sexualized object , separate from nonphysical characteristics ( McKee , 2005 ) . As a consequence of objectification , individuals learn that women’s bodies are able to represent them . This leads to the association between women’s worth and their physical appearance ( Fredrickson & Roberts , 1997 ; Heflick , Goldenberg , Cooper , & Puvia , 2011 ) . Moreover , objectification theory argues that women are typically acculturated to internalize an observer’s perspective as a primary view of their physical selves ( Fredrickson & Roberts , 1997 ) . The effect of this process is defined self - objectification . Since the seminal work of Fredrickson and Roberts ( 1997 ) , numerous papers have investigated the damaging corollary of self - objectification . Correlational studies have found relationships between self - objectification and body shame , appearance anxiety , negative and depressive affect , and various forms of disordered eating ( e . g . Miner - Rubino , Twenge , & Fredrickson , 2002 ; Tiggeman & Kuring , 2004 ) . Experimental research has demonstrated that heightened self - objectification promotes body shame , appearance anxiety , and hinders task performances ( for a review see Moradi & Huang , 2008 ; Rollero , in press ) . However , while there is a large body of research highlighting the consequences of self - objectification very few studies examined the effects of objectification of others ( Heflick & Goldenberg , 2009 ; Heflick et al . , 2011 ; Loughnan , Haslam , Murnane , Vaes , Reynolds , & Suitner , 2010 ; Swami , Coles , Wilson , Salem , Wyrozumska , & Furnham , 2010 ) . To date , these effects seem to concern mainly two different domains : the perception of humanness and the perception of competence . Concerning humanness , research showed that individuals attribute to objectified women less mind , less moral status , and less warmth ( Heflick et al . , 2011 ; Loughnan et al . , 2010 ) . Men and women at work 4 Concerning competence , Heflick and Goldenberg ( 2009 ) demonstrated that focusing on a woman’s appearance leads individuals to reduce the perception of her competence . Men and women at work : the occupational sex bias and the gender pay gap Literature has largely showed that women are generally perceived less competent than men ( Eagly , Wood , & Diekman , 2000 ; Feldstein , Dohm , & Crown , 2001 ; Fiske , Cuddy , Glick , & Xu , 2002 ) . In the occupational domain , stereotypes about women’s competence combine with stereotypes about women’s cognitive and personality characteristics to influence the perception of the type of jobs that women are capable of doing ( Alksnis , Desmarais , & Curtis , 2008 ; Athey & Hautaluoma , 1994 ; Martin , 1992 ; Curşeu & Boroş , 2008 ) . As the lack of fit model posits ( Heilman , 1983 ; 2001 ) , when the applicant’s gender is inconsistent with that of the gender type of the job itself , the candidate will be perceived as a poor fit for the job . For example , whereas stereotypes about women portray them as lacking in those masculine qualities required for masculine job types ( i . e . manager or engineer ) , women will be less likely to be selected for these jobs , being perceived as a misfit for masculine professions ( Heilman , 2001 ) . The lack of fit model explains the occupational sex bias , and has been shown to be related to differential treatment , toward both men and women , in selection , placement , and promotion decisions in work organizations ( Pichler , Varma , & Bruce , 2010 ; Przygodzki - Lionet , Olivier , & Desrumaux , 2010 ) . It is noteworthy that jobs that require stereotypically female traits are less valued than those requiring stereotypically male characteristics ( England , Budig , & Folbre , 2002 ; Glick , 1991 ) . Stereotypes about women and a different evaluation of masculine and feminine jobs contribute to the gender wage gap , whereby the female - male pay difference continues to be substantial in most countries ( Alksnis et al . , 2008 ) . A large body of research has studied the effect of gender on pay ( i . e . Glick , 1991 ; Kanazawa , 2005 ; Lips , 2003 ) , but to our knowledge no study has investigated the effect of objectification yet . Men and women at work 5 Focusing on physical appearance : does it help for job - related outcomes ? Many studies have investigated the effects of physical attractiveness on the evaluation of male and female workers ( see meta - analysis by Hosoda , Stone - Romero , & Coats , 2003 ) . In general , attractiveness seems as important for men as for women concerning job - related outcomes ( Hosoda , Stone - Romero , & Coats , 2003 ) . However , Chiao and colleagues ( Chiao , Bowman , & Gill , 2008 ) in their study about US Presidential election found that only for female candidates did appearance matter , and they were viewed as less competent overall . Glick and colleagues ( Glick , Larsen , Johnson , & Branstiter 2005 ) proposed to distinguish between physical attractiveness and sexiness . Indeed , while physical attractiveness has been shown to generate a broadly favourable impression of both men and women , investigations of the traits associated with women’s sexiness suggest a stereotype that is poor match for high - status jobs . In other words , in contrast to the overall favourable effects that attractiveness has on perceived competence , the sexy woman stereotype is associated with a lack of competence - related traits , and is viewed as less suited for high - status jobs ( Deaux , Winton , Crowley , & Lewis , 1985 ; Glick et al . , 2005 ) . When the role of sexiness on the evaluation of women was experimentally assessed , it was found that a sexy self - presentation harms women in high - , but not low - , status jobs ( Glick et al . , 2005 ) . Focusing the attention on body appearance and promoting the perception of women as sexualized objects , objectification can have similar effects to those of sexiness , although it has not been investigated yet . Present study To summarize , when men and women are evaluated as workers , literature shows that men are generally perceived as more competent than women . Moreover , stereotypically masculine jobs are more valued than feminine jobs and this leads to differential treatments especially concerning wage . Men and women at work 6 Several studies showed that the job - related outcomes are influenced also by physical appearance . If attractiveness is as important for men as for women , sexiness seems to play a different role , harming women in high - status jobs . All these considered , the Objectification Theory might offer a fruitful perspective to understand the occupational sex bias . Indeed , studies have demonstrated that objectification reduces the perception of women’s mind and competence , but the effects of objectification on pay , and , more generally , on suitability for high versus low status jobs have not been investigated yet . Grounded in the objectification framework , the present study aims at investigating the effects of objectification on the evaluation of male and female workers . More specifically , our main goals were : a ) investigating the effects of objectification on the perception of men’s and women’s competence and pay ; and b ) investigating the effects of objectification on the perception of men and women as suitable for high - versus low - status jobs . In particular , we hypothesized that men are generally perceived more competent than women ( Hypothesis 1 ) ( Eagly et . al . , 2000 ; Fiske , et . al . , 2002 ) and that objectified females , but not males , are attributed less competence than non - objectified females ( Hypothesis 2 ) ( Heflick et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , we expected that men are attributed a higher pay than women ( Hypothesis 3 ) ( Alksnis et al . , 2008 ) , whereas no specific predictions were made regarding the role played by objectification . Concerning fit for the job , following the lack of fit model ( Heilman , 1983 ; 2001 ) men are expected to be more suitable for masculine jobs than for feminine jobs , vice versa we expected the contrary for women ( Hypothesis 4 ) . Since objectification does not affect the evaluation of males’ competence ( Heflick et al . , 2011 ) , similarly it should have no effect on the perception of men as suitable for different types of job ( i . e high - verus low - status jobs ) ( Hypothesis 5 ) . Finally , since objectified women are attributed less competence than non - objectified women , objectified women should be considered more suitable for low - status jobs than non - objectified women ( Hypothesis 6 ) ( Glick et al . , 2005 ; Heflick et al . , 2011 ) . Men and women at work 7 Method Participants and Experimental Design A sample of 253 university students ( 127 male and 126 female ) participated to present study . Participants were recruited among undergraduate and graduate students of arts and science schools in Italy . Their average age was 22 . 86 years ( SD = 2 . 38 ) . The ethnic composition of the sample was completely homogeneous : all participants were Italians . The study consisted of a 2 ( Target gender : Male vs . Female ) x 2 ( Objectified vs . non - Objectified ) between - subjects experimental design . Procedure A photograph ( 5 . 31 in . [ 13 . 5 cm ] x 7 . 87 in . [ 20 . 0 cm ] ) of a subject ( target ) was presented to participants . They randomly received one of the four experimental conditions : ( a ) picture of a non - objectified male ; ( b ) picture of a non - objectified female ; ( c ) picture of an objectified male ; or ( d ) picture of an objectified female . Within gender , the person was the same in the objectified and in the non - objectified condition . After viewing the photograph reproducing the target , participants were asked to evaluate the target’s competence , his / her monthly income , and then to estimate the probability that the person in the picture had different jobs . Independent Variables Manipulations Target gender . A pretest of 60 university students ( 34 males and 26 female ; average age 22 . 27 ; SD = 2 . 13 ) received a set of five photographs reproducing different casual dressed females and a set of five photographs reproducing different casual dressed males . Participants were asked to rate the physical attractiveness of the persons reproduced in each photograph . In order to avoid effects of attractiveness , we chose the man and the woman that had the average evaluation of attractiveness , i . e . that was rated neither beautiful nor ugly . They were then used as target subjects in the experiment . In this way , we obtained stimuli different by gender but comparable on attractiveness . Men and women at work 8 Objectification . Referring to the traditional conception of objectification as a focus on the body , the targets varied according to the attention they drew to the body . Following Loughnan and colleagues ( 2010 ) this was manipulated by varying the amount of skin the person in photograph displayed . In the non - objectified condition participants viewed a photograph of a casual dressed subject whereas in the objectified condition the same subject wore a swimsuit . The dimension , position , and face - ism ( measure of facial prominence in the visual representation of a person ) of the person was the same in all the photographs to avoid possible influences of intervenient variables . Dependent measures Competence . To assess the perception of the target ‘s competence , participants were asked to evaluate the target on a list of five traits used in previous studies ( Glick et al . 2005 ; Heflick & Goldenberg , 2009 ) : capable , efficient , intelligent , skilful , responsible . We asked participants to answer “How much do you think the person reproduced in the photograph is …” using a 7 - point scale ranging from 1 ( not at all ) to 7 ( very much ) . That set of items showed a good internal coherence ( Cronbach’α = . 86 ) and was combined in a single variable . Income . Participants were asked to estimate how many euros per month earns the person reproduced in photograph . Job . During the pretest , participants were also asked to rate a list of 44 jobs ( 22 high status and 22 low status ) on a 5 - point scale ranging from 1 ( typical masculine ) to 5 ( typical feminine ) . The status of the jobs was determined by educational level and wages . Compared to low status jobs , high status professions require a university degree or are related to sensibly higher salary expectations . We used these evaluations to select the four most typical masculine jobs ( 2 high - status and 2 low - status ) and the four most typical feminine jobs ( 2 high - status and 2 low - status ) . The selected jobs were : engineer ( masculine , high - status ) ; entrepreneur ( masculine , high - status ) ; plumber ( masculine , low - status ) ; fireman ( masculine , low - status ) ; psychologist ( feminine , high - status ) ; teacher ( feminine , high - status ) ; baby sitter ( feminine , low - status ) ; flight attendant ( feminine , low - status ) . In Men and women at work 9 the experiment we asked participants to answer “How likely do you think the person reproduced in the photograph is a …” then followed the list of selected jobs . Participants responded to each question using a 7 - point scale ranging from 1 ( not at all likely ) to 7 ( very much likely ) . Results Competence and Income We performed two - way between - group ANOVAs to determine the presence of significant effects on each of the dependent variables . As predicted by hypothesis 1 , target gender had a significant effect on competence , F ( 1 , 250 ) = 5 . 88 , p < . 05 . Men ( M = 4 . 19 ; SD = 1 . 08 ) were considered more competent than women ( M = 3 . 80 ; SD = 0 . 97 ) . Instead , hypothesis 2 was not confirmed , as objectification had no effect ( F ( 1 , 250 ) = . 56 , p = . 46 ) and there was no interaction effect too ( F ( 1 , 250 ) = . 02 , p = . 88 ) . As predicted by hypotheses 3 , gender had a significant influence on the evaluation of the monthly income , F ( 1 , 234 ) = 5 . 08 , p < . 05 . Participants estimated men ( M = 1829 . 93 ; SD = 1246 . 90 ) to earn more euros per month than women ( M = 1536 . 41 ; SD = 842 . 77 ) . Also objectification influenced the estimated income , F ( 1 , 234 ) = 5 . 19 , p < . 05 . Objectified targets ( M = 1831 . 73 ; SD = 1211 . 94 ) were considered to earn more than non - objectified ones ( M = 1534 . 56 ; SD = 893 . 35 ) . No interaction effect was found ( F ( 1 , 250 ) = . 84 , p = . 36 ) . Typical masculine jobs In Table 1 are reported the tests of the effects of independent variables on the probability that the person in photograph had the masculine jobs . Target gender had significant main effects on all the dependent variables . As predicted by hypothesis 4 , male targets were considered more suitable for all the masculine jobs ( see Table 2 for descriptive statistics ) . Men and women at work 10 As predicted by hypothesis 5 , objectification had no effect on the likelihood that the person in the photograph is an engineer , an entrepreneur , and a fireman . Contrary to expectations , objectification had a significant effect on the estimated probability that the target is a plumber . The objectified targets ( M = 1 . 98 ; SD = 1 . 22 ) were considered more likely to be plumber than non - objectified targets ( M = 1 . 60 ; SD = 1 . 08 ) . An interaction effect was found on entrepreneur profession ( see Figure 1 ) . In contrast with what predicted by hypothesis 6 , objectified females ( M = 3 . 38 ; SD = 1 . 76 ) were considered more suitable for this high - status job than non - objectified females ( M = 2 . 49 ; SD = 1 . 55 ) , F ( 1 , 123 ) = 8 . 86 , p < . 01 . Typical feminine jobs The tests of the effects on the probability that the person in photograph had the feminine jobs are reported in Table 3 . Target gender had significant main effects on the likelihood that the person in the photograph is a teacher , a baby sitter , and a flight attendant . Hypothesis 4 predicted that female targets were considered more suitable for feminine jobs . This assumption was confirmed only for low status jobs ( baby sitter , flight assistant ) . The effect of target gender on the likelihood to be a teacher was contrary to what predicted : participants considered men more suitable than women ( see Table 4 for descriptive statistics ) . As predicted by hypothesis 6 the objectified women ( M = 4 . 13 ; SD = 1 . 56 ) were considered more suitable for flight assistant job ( low - status ) than non - objectified women ( M = 2 . 69 ; SD = 1 . 67 ) , F ( 1 , 124 ) = 24 . 84 , p < . 01 ( see Figure 2 ) . On the contrary hypothesis 6 was not confirmed for the other low - status feminine job ( baby sitter ) . Neither main nor interactive effects were found . Finally , we found an unexpected interaction effect on the probability to be a teacher ( see Figure 3 ) . In this case objectification had a negative effect on men and not on women . Objectified men ( M = 3 . 87 ; SD = 1 . 66 ) were considered less likely to be teacher than non - objectified men ( M = 4 . 52 ; SD = 1 . 69 ) , F ( 1 , 126 ) = 4 . 70 , p < . 05 . Men and women at work 11 Discussion The hypotheses we set were only partially confirmed . Concerning the evaluation of competence , the target’s gender plays a key role , being males considered more competent than females . Contrary to our predictions , objectification does not seem to reduce the perception of women’s competence . This is in contrast with previous findings ( Heflick et al . , 2011 ; Heflick & Goldenberg , 2009 ; Loughnan et al . , 2010 ) and future research is needed to understand the contrary nature of our results . A preliminary consideration may be related to the different methodologies used in such studies . Indeed , Heflick and Goldenberg ( 2009 ) used two female famous targets ( i . e . Sarah Palin and Angelina Jolie ) , whereas in the present research both sexes were included and targets were common people . In the other studies , when both men and women were included , competence was assessed differently . It was asked to evaluate the competence of a specific worker ( weather forecaster in the study by Heflick et al . , 2011 , and lawyer , manager , stockbroker , and scientist in the study by Loughnan et al . , 2010 ) whereas in our study the job of the target was unknown . It is possible that in such studies the perception of competence was influenced by gender stereotypes as well as by job related stereotypes . In fact , when we considered specific professions , objectification had a significant effect in interaction with target gender ( i . e . entrepreneur , teacher , and flight assistant ) . Along with gender , objectification is determinant to evaluate workers’ pay . If it is well established that the gender wage gap harms women , new findings have been obtained about the role played by objectification . Our results demonstrated that objectified individuals are attributed higher earnings than non - objectified ones . We can argue that focusing on one’s appearance - as in the objectified condition - can produce some consequence similar to those of attractiveness , although attractiveness and objectification are two distinct aspects . Research has demonstrated the effect of body appearance on pay ( Judge & Cable , 2011 ) . Then it is not surprising that objectification , driving the attention to the body , affects the evaluation of a person’s income . Men and women at work 12 About the effect of gender on the evaluation of workers as suitable for specific jobs , globally our findings are in line with the lack of fit model ( Heilman , 1983 ; 2001 ) . The only exceptions are represented by the high - status feminine professions : even though the pretest and previous studies ( e . g . Teig & Susskind , 2008 ) showed that both the psychologist and the teacher are perceived as feminine occupations , present results reveal that teaching is perceived as a male profession , whereas gender has no effect on the job of psychologist . It seems that high - status jobs are considered suitable for men even if typical of the opposite gender . Objectification had different impacts on high - and low - status jobs . Concerning low - status jobs , both in the case of a masculine occupation , i . e . the plumber , and in the case of a feminine occupation , i . e . the flight attendant , objectified subjects are considered more suitable . Thus , objectification increases the suitability for low - status jobs . In the case of flight assistant this effect is stronger for females . The objectified woman is viewed as compatible for lower - status , service - oriented professions , in which women are supposed to cater to men , and for which a nice appearance may be a part of the image associated with the job ( Glick et al . , 2005 ) . In fact , in the case of the other feminine low - status job we considered , i . e . the baby sitter , objectification has no effect probably because it is not a profession aimed at catering to adults , and physical attractiveness is not “required” . The effect of objectification on suitability of men for a low - status job , i . e . the plumber , was not expected . Indeed , nice appearance is not associated with such profession . However , it is possible that in this case objectification emphasizes physical strength and fitness , that are necessary for the plumber . For high - status jobs , the effect of objectification interacts with gender and it is opposite for men and women . Objectification increases women’s fit for a masculine job ( entrepreneur ) , but decreases men’s fit for a feminine occupation ( teacher ) . The fact that objectification could be a benefit for women is explicable as an effect of a social norm . It is well known that human culture values attractiveness more in females than in males ( Avsec , 2006 ; Langlois , Kalakanis , Rubenstein , Men and women at work 13 Larson , Hallam , & Smoot , 2000 ) . This implies that females experience more differential judgment and treatment based on attractiveness than males ( Hatfield & Sprecher , 1986 ; Jackson , 1992 ; Zebrowitz , 1997 ) . Objectification , focusing the attention on the body , could emphasize these mechanisms . Indeed , consistently with this aspect , participants attributed higher income ( typical of high - status jobs ) to objectified targets . On the contrary , for men competence is more important and objectification can be a handicap . This is in line with Loughnan et al . ’s ( 2010 ) findings : the objectified male targets are attributed fewer mental states , less experience , and less moral patiency , features requested for high - status jobs . To sum up , the present study extends the evidence on the consequences of objectification of others . In particular , it underlines the effects of objectification on the evaluation of male and female workers , in high - and in low - status jobs . As seen , both men and women are susceptible to the damaging consequences of objectification , but in different ways . This can have important practical implications for men and women who aspire to hold specific jobs . If significantly altering one’s physical attractiveness is difficult , emphasize or deemphasize the physical appearance is easier . Thus , driving the attention to appearance can be useful for specific professions , but detrimental for others , and this varies in relation to gender . Present study has some limitation and raises questions that are more than worthy of investigation by further research . The first limitation is that our research did not take into account the role of attractiveness . Future studies should investigate the link between objectification and attractiveness . Although literature has widely investigated the favourable effects attractiveness has on numerous aspects , it should be explored the role objectification plays on attractiveness , for both women and men . Moreover , more attention should be deserved to specific professions . Although in our study we considered the effects of objectification in reference to both high - and low - status , and masculine and feminine jobs , it goes without saying that the professions we chose represent only very few occupations among the most frequent jobs . For example , since literature showed that there are more Men and women at work 14 high - status masculine than feminine occupations ( i . e . Parker , Chan , & Saper , 1989 ; Teig & Susskind , 2008 ) , and our results reveal that even typical female high - status jobs ( i . e . teacher ) can be perceived as masculine , it should be interesting investigating the effects of women’s objectification on the suitability for prestigious occupations . This perspective could be a promising contribution to literature on gender roles and sex discrimination in leadership contexts ( e . g . Eagly & Karau , 2002 ; Heilman & Okimoto , 2007 ; De Piccoli & Rollero , 2010 ) . In conclusion , we have seen that objectification can also have some positive effect in the occupational domain . Nevertheless , on the grounds of the already cited negative psychological outcomes of objectification ( Miner - Rubino , Twenge , & Fredrickson , 2002 ; Rollero , in press ; Tiggeman & Kuring , 2004 ; Moradi & Huang , 2008 ) , we can just blame a culture that makes desirable the self - objectification to increase accessibility to high status positions . Research on objectification is only a starting point to change it .
