This 25 study examined the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress before , during , and after a 26 pandemic wave in Switzerland , 2021 . Prevalence of psychological distress was estimated in adults 27 aged 35 - 96 years using the General Health Questionnaire - 12 administered in June 2021 ( Specchio - 28 COVID19 cohort , N = 3965 ) , and compared to values from 2003 - 2006 ( CoLaus | PsyCoLaus cohort , 29 N = 5667 ) . Anxiety and depression were assessed from February to June 2021 using the Generalised 30 Anxiety Disorder scale - 2 and the Patient Health Questionnaire - 2 , respectively . Prevalence of 31 psychological distress in June 2021 , after the pandemic wave ( 16 . 0 % [ 95 % CI , 14 . 6 % - 17 . 4 % ] ) was 32 comparable to pre - pandemic levels ( 15 . 1 % [ 14 . 0 % - 16 . 2 % ] ) . Anxiety and depression were highest at 33 the start of the pandemic wave in February 2021 , and declined from February to June with the 34 relaxation of measures . Predictors of psychological distress included being younger , female , a single 35 parent , unemployed , a change in working hours or job loss in the past 6 months , greater perceived 36 severity and contagiousness of COVID - 19 , and self - reported post COVID - 19 . By June 2021 , following a 37 pandemic wave , prevalence of psychological distress in Switzerland was closer to pre - pandemic 38 levels . These findings highlight the need for additional mental health support during times of stricter 39 government policies relating to COVID - 19 ; yet they also suggest that individuals can adapt relatively 40 quickly to the changing context . 41 Key words : COVID - 19 ; pandemic ; mental health ; psychological distress ; anxiety ; depression 42 43 44 45 46 47 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Introduction 48 There are concerns about acute and long - term mental health effects of the novel coronavirus 49 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic . Research in Europe , the US , and China demonstrated that mental health 50 deteriorated in the early stages of the pandemic ( Fiorillo et al . , 2020 ; McGinty et al . , 2020 ; Pierce et 51 al . , 2020 ; C . Wang et al . , 2020 ) . For example , prevalence of psychological distress in the UK rose from 52 18 . 9 % in 2018 - 2019 to 27 . 3 % in April , 2020 , one month into lockdown ; a stronger increase than 53 previous upward trends ( Pierce et al . , 2020 ) . 54 Acute distress during the COVID - 19 pandemic may lead to long - term mental health problems . 55 Measures of psychological distress predict mental illness ( Goldberg et al . , 1997 ) , and experiences 56 during a pandemic can have long - term mental health effects ( Brooks et al . , 2020 ) . For example , 57 elevated levels of anxiety , depression , and post - traumatic stress symptoms among SARS patients , 58 quarantined people , and healthcare workers during the 2003 SARS epidemic persisted years later 59 ( Lee et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Maunder et al . , 2006 ) . Research suggests that COVID - 19 can be 60 considered a traumatic stressor event capable of eliciting traumatic stress reactions ( Bridgland et al . , 61 2021 ) . 62 Research tracking changes in mental health during the early stages of the COVID - 19 pandemic 63 suggests mental health improves as measures are eased ( Robinson et al . , 2022 ) . In England , anxiety 64 and depression declined across the first 20 weeks following lockdown ( March - August , 2020 ) , with the 65 fastest decreases during lockdown easing measures ( Fancourt et al . , 2021 ) . A similar trend was seen 66 in Germany ( March - June , 2020 ; Bendau et al . , 2021 ) . In Switzerland , 2020 was marked by the first 67 and second pandemic waves . A considerable proportion of Swiss participants reported that their 68 mental health had been adversely affected during the first pandemic wave ( Hernandez et al . , 2021 ) . 69 Prevalence of distress was reported to increase further during the second wave of autumn and 70 winter 2020 , which coincided with a retightening of restrictions to contain the pandemic ( de 71 Quervain et al . , 2020 ) . Just one known previous study examined trajectories of mental health at a 72 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 later stage of the pandemic in Switzerland ( August 2020 - May 2021 ) . In a sample of 732 people living 73 in the Ticino region of Switzerland , depression , anxiety , and stress increased from August 2020 to 74 May 2021 , with the greatest increases during the second wave of the pandemic , and little differences 75 after the second wave ( Piumatti et al . , 2022 ) . The third pandemic wave in early 2021 ( February to 76 May ) was less severe than the first and second in terms of hospitalisations and deaths ( Federal Office 77 of Public Health , 2021 ) . By June 2021 , there were few cases , and government measures were less 78 stringent than earlier in the year ( University of Oxford , 2021 ) . Mental health may have been 79 generally better at this stage of the pandemic , although this has not yet been examined . As the 80 situation has evolved , monitoring mental health throughout the pandemic , with comparisons to pre - 81 pandemic data , is needed to inform future public health measures . 82 Pre - pandemic factors , such as demographics and life circumstances , likely remain important 83 predictors of psychological distress throughout the pandemic . Being female and younger predicted 84 psychological distress , and greater increases in distress , during the early stages of the pandemic 85 ( Fancourt et al . , 2021 ; Kwong et al . , 2021 ; Pierce et al . , 2020 ) . COVID - 19 - specific factors , such as a 86 diagnosis of COVID - 19 ( Taquet et al . , 2020 ) , changes in work circumstances and unpaid care at home 87 ( McDowell et al . , 2021 ; Xue & McMunn , 2021 ) , high perceived risk of dying from COVID - 19 , and 88 social distancing ( Kämpfen et al . , 2020 ) , also contributed to people’s mental health during the early 89 stages of the pandemic . 90 The main aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of general psychological distress , as well 91 as symptoms of anxiety and depression , during and following the third wave of the COVID - 19 92 pandemic in Switzerland ( February - June 2021 ) , with comparisons to pre - pandemic levels of distress . 93 A second aim was to examine a range of pre - pandemic and COVID - 19 - specific predictors of 94 psychological distress at this stage of the pandemic . 95 96 97 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Participants 98 Information on psychological distress and potential predictors during the pandemic was from 99 Specchio - COVID19 , a population - based digital study launched in December 2020 to follow up 100 serosurvey participants in Geneva , Switzerland ( Baysson et al . , 2022 ) . Serosurvey participants were 101 randomly selected from the Bus Santé population - based study , and from Geneva registries ( Stringhini 102 et al . , 2020 ; Stringhini , Zaballa , Perez - Saez , et al . , 2021 ) . Adult serosurvey participants were invited to 103 take part in the Specchio - COVID19 study after a baseline serologic test . From the 10 616 adult 104 serosurvey participants invited , 6394 enrolled in Specchio - COVID19 ( participation rate 60 % , not 105 taking into account participants unreachable owing to false email addresses ) . Non - specific 106 psychological distress was assessed via questionnaire in June 2021 . Anxiety and depression were 107 assessed through monthly questionnaires administered from February to June 2021 . Of the 6394 108 participants enrolled in Specchio - COVID19 , 4636 individuals ( 73 % ; mean age = 51 years ( range = 18 - 96 109 years ) ) completed the measure of psychological distress in June 2021 ( see supplementary figure S1 ) . 110 3538 / 4636 ( 76 % ) completed the measures of anxiety and depression in June 2021 . 111 Information on pre - pandemic psychological distress was from the CoLaus | PsyCoLaus cohort , a 112 population - based study of individuals aged 35 - 75 years at baseline living in Lausanne , Switzerland 113 ( Firmann et al . , 2008 ) . Psychological distress was assessed once before the pandemic ( 2003 - 2006 ) ; 114 anxiety and depression were assessed at follow - up , closer to the time of the pandemic ( 2014 - 2018 ) . 115 Supplementary analyses therefore included pre - pandemic measures of anxiety and depression to 116 complement the pre - pandemic assessment of psychological distress in 2003 - 2006 . Participants were 117 aged 35 years and above at the psychological distress assessment ( 2003 - 2006 ) , and 45 years and 118 above at the depression and anxiety assessment ( 2014 - 2018 ) . Prevalence estimates for each cohort 119 were therefore examined in adults aged 35 years and above ( psychological distress ) , and in adults 120 aged 45 years and above ( anxiety and depression ) . In CoLaus | PsyCoLaus , 5667 individuals ( mean 121 age = 53 years ( range = 35 - 75 years ) ) completed the psychological distress questionnaire at baseline 122 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 ( 2003 - 2006 ) ; 3663 individuals ( mean age = 63 years ( range = 45 - 88 years ) ) completed the diagnostic 123 interviews at follow - up ( 2014 - 2018 ) . In Specchio - COVID19 , 3965 individuals aged 35 years and above 124 completed the psychological distress questionnaire in June 2021 ; 2507 individuals aged 45 years and 125 above completed the anxiety and depression questionnaires in June 2021 . See Table S1 for an 126 overview of the measures and assessment points in CoLaus | PsyCoLaus and Specchio - COVID19 . 127 This study was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki . The 128 Specchio - COVID19 study was approved by the Cantonal Research Ethics Commission of Geneva 129 ( CCER project ID 2020 - 00881 ) ; the physical and psychiatric investigations of CoLaus | PsyCoLaus were 130 approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Lausanne ( project reference 131 numbers : 16 / 03 , 33 / 09 , 26 / 14 and 134 / 05 , 239 / 09 , respectively ) , which later became the Ethics 132 Commission of Canton Vaud . All participants provided written informed consent . 133 134 Measures 135 Upon registration , Specchio - COVID19 participants completed a questionnaire assessing 136 sociodemographic factors and pre - existing chronic disease . Self - reported SARS - CoV - 2 infections , 137 perceived COVID - 19 severity and contagiousness , COVID - 19 - related quarantine , changes in work 138 circumstances , and loneliness , were assessed through monthly questionnaires . Self - reported post 139 COVID - 19 , need for psychological support , suicidal ideation , and psychosocial factors including 140 perceived stress and social support were assessed by questionnaire in June 2021 . 141 Mental health outcomes 142 In Specchio - COVID19 and CoLaus | PsyCoLaus , the 12 - item General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ - 12 ) 143 measured non - specific psychological distress ( Goldberg et al . , 1997 ; Lundin et al . , 2016 ) . 144 Respondents rate the extent to which they have experienced each symptom in the past two weeks 145 compared to their usual state . Responses for each symptom were dichotomised ( 0 - 0 - 1 - 1 ) and 146 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 summed into an index ( range 0 - 12 ) . A score of 4 or more indicates clinically significant levels of 147 psychological distress ( Pierce et al . , 2020 ) . 148 In Specchio - COVID19 , the General Anxiety Disorder - 2 scale ( GAD - 2 ) and the Patient Health 149 Questionnaire - 2 ( PHQ - 2 ) assessed anxiety and depression . Respondents indicate how often they 150 experienced each symptom over the past 2 weeks . Scores are summed ( range 0 - 6 ) ; a total score of 3 151 or higher indicates probable depression or anxiety disorder ( Kroenke et al . , 2003 ; Kroenke et al . , 152 2007 ) . The PHQ - 2 and GAD - 2 have acceptable sensitivity and specificity for any depressive and 153 anxiety disorder , respectively , at a threshold of ≥3 ( Plummer et al . , 2016 ; Staples et al . , 2019 ) . In 154 CoLaus | PsyCoLaus , depression and anxiety disorder were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for 155 Genetic Studies ( Nurnberger et al . , 1994 ) . Depressive disorder included diagnosed current major 156 depressive disorder or dysthymia . Anxiety disorder included diagnosed current generalised anxiety 157 disorder , panic disorder , agoraphobia , social phobia , specific phobias , posttraumatic stress disorder , 158 or obsessive compulsive disorder . 159 In Specchio - COVID19 , participants were asked whether they had felt a new need for psychological 160 help or to contact a listening and psychological support unit since the beginning of the pandemic 161 ( yes / no ) . Suicidal ideation over the past month was assessed using the following question from the 162 Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( Posner et al . , 2011 ) : ‘In the past month , have you wished you 163 were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up ? ’ ( yes / no ) . 164 Sociodemographic factors and living circumstances 165 Sociodemographic factors included biological sex ( male , female ) , age ( years ) , and ethnicity ( white 166 European or other ) . Education level was primary ( none or compulsory education ) , secondary ( high 167 school diploma or vocational training ) , or tertiary ( university level qualification ) . Employment status 168 was employed , self - employed , retired , unemployed , or other economically inactive ( not working and 169 not looking for work , such as students , and people unable to work for health reasons or disability ) . 170 Household income was categorised according to household composition , using information from the 171 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Cantonal Office of Statistics of Geneva for 2015 - 2017 ( low ( below the first quartile of the income 172 distribution ) , medium ( between the first and third quartiles ) , or high ( above the third quartile ) ) . 173 Living arrangement was living alone , as a single parent , as a couple with children , as a couple without 174 children , or with other adults . Household density was the ratio of people to bedrooms , and 175 categorised as overcrowded ( > 2 ) , or not ove rcrowded ( ≤ 2 ) . Housing conditions were house with 176 outdoor space , appartment with outdoor space , or appartment without outdoor space . Urbanicity 177 was rural , urban outskirts , or urban . 178 Work conditions 179 Each month ( January - June , 2021 ) , participants reported their employment situation , and whether 180 their working conditions had changed . This information was used to create three binary variables : 1 ) 181 change to telework in the last 6 months , 2 ) change in working hours ( increased or decreased ) in the 182 last 6 months , 3 ) job loss in the last 6 months . For each variable , employees whose working 183 conditions had not changed was the reference category . 184 Health and psychosocial factors 185 Participants were asked if they had any long - standing chronic illness , and to select their illness ( es ) 186 from a list , which included mental health conditions . These responses were used to create a variable 187 indicating presence or absence of a mental health condition . Participants were also asked if they 188 were receiving any psychological support from a health professional ( psychologist , psychiatrist , or 189 psychotherapist ) prior to the pandemic , and whether this support was maintained during the 190 pandemic . This information was combined to create a variable with three categories : no 191 psychological support prior to pandemic , psychological support prior to and during pandemic , and 192 psychological support prior to but not during pandemic . 193 Loneliness , perceived stress , and social support were assessed using the 3 - item Revised UCLA 194 Loneliness Scale ( Hughes et al . , 2004 ) , Perceived Stress Scale ( Cohen , 1988 ) , and 3 - item Oslo Social 195 Support Scale ( Bøen et al . , 2012 ) , respectively . For each scale , higher scores indicate greater 196 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 loneliness , perceived stress , and social support . Internal consistency of the scales was high 197 ( Cronbach’s α range = 0 . 6 - 0 . 9 ) . Adverse life events in the past 6 months ( yes / no ) included death of a 198 loved one , illness of a loved one , separation / divorce / family problems , violence at home , violence 199 outside the home , job loss ( own or partner ) , bankruptcy and / or financial difficulties , new or 200 worsened diseases and accidents , and other events considered negative . 201 COVID - 19 - specific factors 202 To examine potential short - and longer - term effects of COVID - 19 on mental health , previous SARS - 203 CoV - 2 infection ( natural ) was measured as : 1 ) a positive PCR test result in the last 6 months ( January - 204 June 2021 ) , and 2 ) a positive serology test result since March 2020 ( Stringhini et al . , 2020 ; Stringhini 205 et al . , 2021a ; Stringhini et al . , 2021b ) . Other COVID - 19 - specific factors included self - reported post 206 COVID ( ‘are you currently or have you suffered from long - term COVID , that is , long - term 207 manifestations of COVID - 19 ( such as symptoms that per sist beyond three weeks ) ? ’ Yes / no ) , having to 208 quarantine due to contact with a person who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 in the last 6 months 209 ( yes / no ) , perceived severity of COVID - 19 , and perceived contagiousness of COVID - 19 ( 1 = not at all , 210 5 = extremely ) . 211 212 Statistical analysis 213 Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4 . 1 . 0 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , 214 Vienna , Austria ) . Proportions and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated for the measure of 215 psychological distress in the Specchio - COVID19 and CoLaus | PsyCoLaus cohorts separately . Analyses 216 of both data sets incorporated survey sampling weights ( for age , sex , and education using statistics 217 from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office ) to generate nationally representative estimates of 218 psychological distress . Mean scores , with standard deviation bounds , on the GAD - 2 , PHQ - 2 , and 219 UCLA - Loneliness Scale were reported from February to June 2021 in the Specchio - COVID19 cohort . 220 Supplementary analysis examined prevalence ( proportions and 95 % CIs ) of anxiety and depression in 221 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 the Specchio - COVID19 and CoLaus | PsyCoLaus cohorts . A second supplementary analysis examined 222 prevalence of psychological distress , anxiety , and depression in CoLaus | PsyCoLaus in winter and 223 summer months separately . 224 Logistic regression was used to examine pre - pandemic and COVID - 19 - specific predictors of 225 psychological distress ( GHQ - 12 score ≥ 4 ) in the total Specchio - COVID19 cohort ( N = 4636 ) . Univariable 226 and minimised multivariable regression models were ran to identify groups at risk for psychological 227 distress , which could be further examined in future research , for example in a structural equation 228 model with more specific confounding structures . Age , sex , education level , and pre - existing mental 229 health condition were included as covariates in the multivariable regression models . Cluster robust 230 standard errors were used to account for potentially nested data within households . Of the total 231 sample , 1544 ( 33 % ) shared a household with another participant . The majority of these participants 232 ( 90 % ) indicated that they were living as a couple , and were therefore biologically unrelated . A p 233 value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . 234 235 Results 236 Sample characteristics 237 Characteristics of adults aged 35 years and above in the Specchio - COVID19 and CoLaus | PsyCoLaus 238 cohorts are shown in Table 1 . The cohort samples were similar in terms of age and sex distribution , 239 employment status , and most were white Europeans . A greater proportion of Specchio - COVID19 240 participants were educated to tertiary level than CoLaus | PsyCoLaus participants ( 66 % vs . 21 % ) . 241 Characteristics of the total Specchio - COVID19 sample , including potential predictors of psychological 242 distress , are shown in Table 2 . Participants were on average 51 years old ( range 18 - 96 years ) , 57 % 243 were women , and 65 % were educated to tertiary level . In comparison with the general population of 244 Switzerland , there was an over - representation of 45 - 55 year olds , and those with tertiary level 245 education ( see Table S2 ) . Compared with non - responders , participants who completed the measure 246 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 of psychological distress in June 2021 were older ( mean age 51 years vs . 43 years ) , more highly 247 educated ( 4 % vs . 7 % had no formal education ) , had a higher income ( 18 % vs . 23 % had low income ) , a 248 greater proportion were white Europeans ( 92 % vs . 86 % ) , a greater proportion were retired ( 22 % vs 249 8 % ) , and a smaller proportion were living as a couple with children ( 43 % vs . 53 % ) ( see Table S3 ) . 250 Prevalence of psychological distress 251 Figure 1 shows the weighted prevalence of psychological distress among adults aged 35 years and 252 above in the Specchio - COVID19 and CoLaus | PsyCoLaus cohorts . 253 < Insert Figure 1 here > 254 In June 2021 , 16 . 0 % ( 95 % CI , 14 . 6 % - 17 . 4 % ) of adults aged 35 years and above ( N = 3965 ) reported 255 symptoms of psychological distress , relative to 15 . 1 % ( 14 . 0 % - 16 . 2 % ; N = 5667 ) in 2003 - 2006 . Among 256 the subgroups examined , in June 2021 , psychological distress was highest among those aged 35 - 45 257 years ( 22 . 2 % [ 19 . 2 % - 25 . 6 % ] ) . The corresponding prevalence estimate for this group in 2003 - 2006 258 was 19 . 1 % ( 17 . 0 % - 21 . 4 % ) . The lowest prevalence of psychological distress among the subgroups 259 examined in June 2021 was observed in adults aged 65 years or older ( 9 . 8 % [ 7 . 6 % - 12 . 7 % ] ) , which had 260 a corresponding prevalence estimate of 10 . 4 % ( 8 . 3 % - 12 . 9 % ) in 2003 - 2006 . Estimates of psychological 261 distress in June 2021 ( Specchio - COVID19 cohort ) were even higher among those younger than 35 262 years : 18 - 24 year olds ( 30 . 4 % [ 24 . 2 % - 37 . 4 % ] ) ; 25 - 34 year olds ( 22 . 6 % [ 18 . 8 % - 27 . 0 % ] ) . 263 Depression and anxiety symptoms , as well as loneliness , declined from February - June 2021 in the 264 total sample ( see Figure 2 ) . Including all age groups , the weighted prevalence of probable depressive 265 disorder in February 2021 was 13 . 5 % ( 11 . 9 % - 15 . 2 % ; N = 3082 ) ; the weighted prevalence of probable 266 anxiety disorder was 15 . 9 % ( 14 . 2 % - 17 . 7 % ; N = 3082 ) . 267 < Insert Figure 2 here > 268 In June 2021 , 12 . 6 % ( 477 / 3771 ) reported they had felt a new need for psychological help or to 269 contact a counseling and psychological support unit since the start of the pandemic . 5 . 3 % ( 200 / 3771 ) 270 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 reported having had suicidal thoughts in the past month ; an additional 2 . 9 % ( 110 / 3771 ) did not wish 271 to respond . 272 Supplementary analyses showed that in June 2021 , 6 . 8 % ( 5 . 5 % - 8 . 3 % ) of adults aged 45 years and 273 above ( N = 2507 ) had probable depressive disorder , and 8 % ( 6 . 5 % - 9 . 7 % ) had probable anxiety 274 disorder , relative to 8 . 1 % ( 7 . 2 % - 9 . 1 % ; N = 3663 ) with diagnosed depressive disorder , and 10 . 6 % ( 9 . 6 % - 275 11 . 6 % ; N = 3652 ) with diagnosed anxiety disorder in 2014 - 2018 . 276 Additional supplementary analyses in CoLaus | PsyCoLaus showed the prevalence of psychological 277 distress , anxiety , and depression was not higher in winter than summer months , respectively : 278 unweighted estimates for psychological distress ( 17 . 3 % [ 15 . 6 % - 19 . 2 % ] vs . 15 . 7 % [ 14 . 7 % - 17 . 9 % ] ) ; 279 anxiety disorder ( 9 . 6 % [ 7 . 8 % - 11 . 7 % ] vs . 12 . 1 % [ 9 . 9 % - 14 . 9 % ] ) ; depressive disorder ( 6 . 5 % [ 5 . 1 % - 8 . 4 % ] 280 vs . 8 . 4 % [ 6 . 6 % - 10 . 8 % ] ) . 281 Predictors of psychological distress in the Specchio - COVID19 cohort 282 Predictors of psychological distress in the total Specchio - COVID19 sample are shown in Table 3 . 283 In the univariable models , female sex , non - white ethnicity , unemployment status or other economic 284 inactivity , living in an apartment with or without access to outdoor space , and living alone , as a single 285 parent , as a couple with children , or with others ( not children ) were demographic factors associated 286 with greater risk of psychological distress ( OR range = 1 . 20 - 2 . 54 ) . Older age and retirement was 287 associated with reduced risk of psychological distress . Pre - existing mental health condition , pre - 288 pandemic psychological support , experiencing adverse life events in the past 6 months , greater 289 loneliness , and greater perceived stress were health and psychosocial factors associated with greater 290 risk of psychological distress ( OR range = 1 . 27 - 2 . 81 ) . Greater social support was associated with 291 reduced risk of psychological distress . Experiencing a change in working hours in the past 6 months , 292 experiencing a job loss in the past 6 months , greater perceived contagiousness of COVID - 19 , and self - 293 reported post COVID - 19 were COVID - 19 - specific factors associated with greater risk of psychological 294 distress ( OR range = 1 . 17 - 2 . 08 ) . 295 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 In the multivariable models , all of the above , apart from non - white ethnicity , living in an apartment 296 with or without access to outdoor space , living alone or as a couple with children , and stopping 297 psychological support during the pandemic , remained statistically significant predictors of 298 psychological distress . 299 300 Discussion 301 Overall prevalence of psychological distress among adults aged 35 years and above in June 2021 , 302 following a COVID - 19 pandemic wave in Switzerland , was comparable to pre - pandemic levels in 303 2003 - 2006 . Depression , anxiety , and loneliness declined from February to June 2021 , along with the 304 progressive relaxation of containment measures in Switzerland . Within the sampled period 305 ( February - June 2021 ) , the highest prevalence of probable depression and anxiety disorder was in 306 February 2021 , at the start of the wave . Mental health was closer to pre - pandemic levels by the end 307 of the wave in June 2021 , but a fair proportion of participants reported a new need for psychological 308 support since the start of the pandemic . Pre - pandemic and COVID - 19 - specific factors predicted 309 psychological distress . These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring of mental health 310 as the pandemic evolves , alongside efforts to support vulnerable groups . 311 Prevalence of psychological distress 312 In Europe , the US , and China , prevalence of psychological distress during the early stages of the 313 pandemic was higher than before the pandemic ( McGinty et al . , 2020 ; Pierce et al . , 2020 ; C . Wang et 314 al . , 2020 ) . The uncertainty and sudden change to everyday life , reduced social contact , and health 315 concerns explained this early increase in distress ( Robinson & Daly , 2021 ) . The comparatively lower 316 rates of psychological distress seen in June 2021 in the present study , alongside the decline in 317 depression , anxiety , and loneliness , from February to June , coincides with the end of the third wave 318 ( Federal Office of Public Health ) , and a relaxation of government policies in Switzerland ( Oxford 319 COVID - 19 Government Response Tracker ) . By the end of the third wave , 66 % of the Geneva 320 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 population had developed SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies after vaccination and / or infection ( Stringhini et al . , 321 2021b ) , there was some resumption to pre - pandemic life , and perceived health - related threats may 322 have subsided . These findings concur with research during the early stages of the COVID - 19 323 pandemic , which found mental health improved as measures were eased ( Robinson et al . , 2022 ) , and 324 suggests overall there has been resilience in mental health . 325 Before and during the pandemic , prevalence of psychological distress was highest among women , 326 and lowest among older adults ( ≥ 65 years ) . These findings concur with those of the latest Swiss 327 Health Survey in 2017 ( Schuler et al . , 2020 ) . In the Specchio - COVID19 cohort , 30 % of 18 - 34 year olds 328 reported psychological distress in June 2021 . In the Swiss Health Survey , 22 % of 15 - 34 year olds in 329 Geneva reported psychological distress ( Zufferey , 2020 ) . Although it is not possible to draw firm 330 conclusions due to differences in the age groups , and in the measures used , the higher prevalence of 331 distress among younger participants in Specchio - COVID19 suggests younger people may still be 332 disproportionately affected by the pandemic ( Pierce et al . , 2020 ) . 333 Predictors of psychological distress in the Specchio - COVID19 cohort 334 Additional pre - pandemic predictors of psychological distress in June 2021 included unemployment , 335 being a single parent , having a pre - existing mental health condition , experiencing adverse life events 336 in the past 6 months , greater loneliness , and greater perceived stress . Retirement and greater social 337 support were associated with reduced risk of psychological distress . These findings corroborate and 338 extend research on psychological distress during the early stages of the pandemic ( Fancourt et al . , 339 2021 ; Kwong et al . , 2021 ; Pierce et al . , 2020 ) , and highlight the persistence of social inequalities in 340 mental health . Ensuring safe access to essential services ( such as childcare ) , financial security ( for 341 example through government investment in debt respite ) , free or heavily subsidised mental health 342 services ( including online services , where appropriate ) , and mental health promotion within the 343 community are ways in which vulnerable groups can be supported during and following the 344 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 pandemic ( Aknin et al . , 2022 ; McDaid , 2021 ) . Mental health care providers also play a key role in 345 responding to their patients concerns related to COVID - 19 ( Ghebreyesus , 2020 ) . 346 COVID - 19 - specific predictors of psychological distress in June 2021 included a change in working 347 hours or job loss in the past 6 months , greater perceived severity and contagiousness of COVID - 19 , 348 and self - reported post COVID - 19 . Previous research found job loss , but not switching to remote 349 working in April 2020 , predicted poorer mental health in US adults ( McDowell et al . , 2021 ) . The 350 present study corroborates these findings during a pandemic wave in 2021 , and confirms that a 351 change in working hours ( increase or decrease ) may be detrimental for mental health . The impact of 352 changing work circumstances on mental health likely depends on the duration of change , as well as 353 the individual ' s personal circumstances , and requires further investigation . Some families may 354 benefit from the flexibility of home working , while others may feel isolated ( Birimoglu Okuyan & 355 Begen , 2022 ) . 356 Worries about the risk of infection and dying from COVID - 19 have previously been associated with 357 poorer mental health ( Kämpfen et al . , 2020 ) . Worries about COVID - 19 may worsen mental health , 358 and poorer mental health may lead to rumination and worries about COVID - 19 . Self - reported post 359 COVID - 19 , but not previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection , predicted psychological distress in the present 360 study . A large - scale US study including 62 ’ 354 COVID - 19 cases found that a COVID - 19 diagnosis was 361 associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorder during the first 14 to 90 days after diagnosis 362 ( Taquet et al . , 2021 ) . The present study included 258 cases with a positive PCR / rapid antigen test in 363 the last 6 months , and may not have been sufficiently powered to detect an association , other than 364 in more severe cases with self - reported post COVID - 19 . Associations between COVID - 19 and 365 psychological distress are bidirectional , and could be mediated by biological and behavioural factors 366 ( Mazza et al . , 2020 ; Taquet et al . , 2021 ; Wu et al . , 2020 ) . 367 There was no association between quarantine ( due to contact with a person who tested positive for 368 SARS - CoV - 2 ) in the past 6 months and psychological distress . This finding contrasts with previously 369 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 reported adverse effects of quarantine during the COVID - 19 pandemic ( Shi et al . , 2020 ; Yunhe Wang 370 et al . , 2021 ) . However , null associations between quarantine and mental health have been reported 371 ( Yongguang Wang et al . , 2011 ) . The conditions and duration of quarantine , individual circumstances , 372 and COVID - 19 - related attitudes play an important role ( Brooks et al . , 2020 ; Shi et al . , 2020 ; Yunhe 373 Wang et al . , 2021 ) . For example , quarantine is most strongly associated with psychological distress 374 among vulnerable groups ( Yunhe Wang et al . , 2021 ) ; and centralised quarantine in an unfamiliar 375 environment is more strongly associated with adverse outcomes ( Shi et al . , 2020 ) . Further research is 376 needed to assess the longer - term effects of quarantine during the COVID - 19 pandemic . 377 Strengths and limitations 378 Study strengths include the population - level , longitudinal data from two cohorts , and range of 379 potential predictors of psychological distress . The GHQ - 12 , GAD - 2 , and PHQ - 2 are validated self - 380 report measures , and correlate strongly with clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorder . However , they 381 are not clinical assessments and do not capture all forms of mental distress . The comparison of 382 psychological distress in the pre - pandemic and Specchio - COVID19 cohorts was limited to adults aged 383 35 years and above , and cannot be generalised to younger age groups , who may be particularly 384 impacted by the pandemic ( Pierce et al . , 2020 ) . The pre - pandemic measure of psychological distress 385 was assessed in 2003 - 2006 , many years before the pandemic . Although various aspects of society 386 have changed since this time , some studies found no secular change in the prevalence of anxiety and 387 depression from the early 2000s until prior to the pandemic ( e . g . Baxter et al . , 2014 ; Bebbington et 388 al . , 2020 ) . Other studies have reported an increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression , 389 especially in young adults aged 18 to 35 years ( Gagné et al . , 2021 ; Goodwin et al . , 2020 ) . Given that 390 previous research suggests anxiety and depression may have remained stable or increased over time 391 prior to the pandemic , we can be confident that the prevalence of psychological distress that we 392 measured one year into the pandemic was not higher than pre - pandemic estimates . The decline in 393 anxiety and depression in Specchio - COVID19 was observed from winter to summer . However , the 394 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 results suggest effects greater than usual seasonal variations ( Winthorst et al . , 2011 ) ; and 395 supplementary analysis in CoLaus | PsyCoLaus showed no difference in the prevalence of 396 psychological distress , anxiety , and depression in winter and summer months . Specchio - COVID19 397 participants had a higher education level than CoLaus | PsyCoLaus participants . Although weights 398 were applied to make the sample representative of the Swiss population , it is still possible that there 399 was some selection bias due to other factors associated with survey participation not accounted for 400 by weighting ( e . g . topic interest ) . The data were from French - speaking regions in Switzerland , and 401 vulnerable individuals with poor mental health are less likely to participate in surveys ; therefore , the 402 findings may not generalise to all regions in Switzerland , or to more vulnerable groups . During the 403 development of the Specchio - COVID19 study , post COVID - 19 was defined as symptoms lasting longer 404 than 3 weeks , but it is currently defined as usually occuring 3 months from the onset of COVID - 19 , 405 with symptoms lasting for at least 2 months ( Soriano et al . , 2021 ) . Further research is therefore 406 needed to examine associations between post - COVID19 and mental health . Since June 2021 , there 407 have been further pandemic waves , containment measures , and the recent lifting of measures in 408 March 2022 . It will be important to examine mental health during this time , as well as potential 409 longer - term effects in vulnerable groups . 410 Practical implications and conclusions 411 Acute distress during the COVID - 19 pandemic may lead to long - term mental health problems , 412 therefore it is important to monitor how mental health , including symptoms of psychological distress 413 evolve during the pandemic , as well as predictors of distress . This study suggests that psychological 414 distress was highest at the start of the third pandemic wave in Switzerland , but by the end of the 415 wave in June 2021 , overall prevalence was comparable with pre - pandemic levels . These findings 416 highlight the need for additional mental health support during times of stricter government policies 417 relating to COVID - 19 ; yet these data also suggest that individuals can adapt relatively quickly to the 418 changing context . This study also identifed a range of pre - pandemic and COVID - 19 - specific predictors 419 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 of distress at the end of the third wave , highlighting the persistence of inequalities in mental health . 420 These findings therefore highlight the need for ongoing monitoring of mental health as the pandemic 421 evolves , with efforts from the government and healthcare practitioners to support vulnerable 422 groups . 423 References 424 Aknin , L .
