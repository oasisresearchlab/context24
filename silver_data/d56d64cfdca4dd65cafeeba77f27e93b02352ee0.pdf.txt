Concluding Remarks 126 Acknowledgments 127 References 127 Abstract There is now considerable experimental evidence that aberrant activation of Rho family small GTPases promotes uncontrolled proliferation , invasion , and metastatic properties of human cancer cells . Therefore , there is considerable interest in the development of small molecule inhibitors of Rho GTPase func - tion . However , to date , most efforts have focused on inhibitors that block Rho GTPase function indirectly , either by targeting enzymes involved in post - translational processing or downstream protein kinase effectors . We have reported the identification and characterization of the EHT 1864 small molecule as an inhibitor of Rac family small GTPases , placing Rac 1 in an inert and inactive state and then impairing Rac 1 - mediated functions in vivo . Our work suggests that EHT 1864 selectively inhibits Rac 1 downstream signaling and cellular transformation by a novel mechanism involving guanine nucleotide displace - ment .

Introduction Rho family GTPases are molecular switches that play key roles in the modulation of a wide range of cellular processes , including cell migration , cell polarization , membrane trafficking , cytoskeleton rearrangements , pro - liferation , apoptosis , and transcriptional regulation ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ) . It is , therefore , not surprising that the aberrant functions of Rho family GTPases contribute to the generation of different human pathologies , including cancer ( Boettner and Van Aelst , 2002 ; Sahai and Marshall , 2002 ) . Unlike Ras proteins , activating mutations in Rho GTPases are not found in human cancers . Instead , aberrant Rho GTPase activity found in tumors is a result of alterations in Rho GTPase expression or the perturbed function of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) or GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) that regulate Rho GTPase function ( Karnoub et al . , 2004 ) . Of the 20 members of the Rho GTPase family , proteins in particular of the Rac subfamily of small GTPases ( Rac1 , Rac1b , Rac2 , and Rac3 ) have been implicated in cellular transformation and cancer progression . Rac1 is essential for transformation caused by Ras and other oncogenes , for exam - ple , promoting soft agar growth and migration of Ras - transformed cells ( Ferraro et al . , 2006 ; Khosravi - Far et al . , 1995 ; Qiu et al . , 1995 ; Renshaw et al . , 1996 ; Zohn et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , proteins levels of Rac1 are elevated in breast tumors ( Fritz et al . , 1999 ) . A splice variant of Rac1 , Rac1b , is constitutively active and transforming and is found overexpressed in breast and colon cancers ( Jordan et al . , 1999 ; Schnelzer et al . , 2000 ; Singh et al . , 2004 ) . Mutation and overexpression of Rac3 have been seen in human brain tumors , and RNA interference demonstrated a role for Rac1 and Rac3 in human glioblastoma invasion ( Chan et al . , 2005 ; Hwang et al . , 2005 ) . Finally , expression of a normally hematopoietic cell - specific Rac - GEF Vav1 is upregulated in pancreatic cancers , leading to Rac1 activation , and levels of Vav1 expression correlate with patient survival rate ( Denicola and Tuveson , 2005 ; Fernandez - Zapico et al . , 2005 ) . Because of their critical role in human oncogenesis , Rho GTPases are therefore attractive and validated targets for anticancer therapies . One approach has involved small molecule inhibitors of protein prenyltrans - ferases ( Fig . 9 . 1A ) . Those enzymes catalyze the lipid modification of Rho GTPases , which then promotes the membrane association required for Rho GTPase interaction with effectors and biological activity ( Basso et al . , 2006 ; Sebti and Hamilton , 2000 ) . However , the success of these inhibitors has been limited at best in part because of their lack of sufficient specificity to 112 Cercina Onesto et al . selectively block Rho GTPase function ( Reid et al . , 2004 ) . Another approach has involved inhibitors of protein kinase effectors of Rho GTPases ( e . g . , ROCK and PAK protein kinases ) , but these inhibitors may not impair Cysmethynil Icmt Plasma membrane ER Rce1 GGTasel GGTI B A Rac Rac Rac RacGAP Rac GTP RaCGEF NSC27366 Geranylgeranyl isoprenoid EHT 1864 - C - OMe - C - OMe - C - CAAX - CAAX E RacGDP S N N 2 .

Various small molecule inhibitorsof Rac function have beendescribed orcon - sidered . Theseincludeinhibitorsof Racpost - translational modification . Racterminates in a CAAX tetrapeptide sequence ( C ¼ Cys , A ¼ aliphatic amino acid , X ¼ Leu ) . This CAAX motif signals for three sequential post - translational modifications that convert the cytosolic , inactive Rac GTPase to a plasma membrane - associated protein . Geranyl - geranyltransferase I ( GGTaseI ) catalyzes addition of the C20 geranylgeranyl isoprenoid to the Cys residue of the CAAX motif , followed by Rac converting enzyme 1 ( Rce1 ) - catalyzed proteolytic removal of the AAX residues , and isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase ( Icmt ) - catalyzed carboxyl methylation of the now terminal geranyl - geranylated cysteine residue . Rac cycles between an inactive GDP - bound and an active GTP - bound state that is regulated by GTPase activating proteins ( RhoGAPs ) and gua - nine nucleotide exchange factors ( RhoGEFs ) . Rac - GTP binds preferentially to a large spectrum of functionally diverse effectors ( E ) that regulate cytoplasmic signaling net - works . GGTaseI inhibitors ( GGTIs ) block all CAAX - signaled modifications , rendering Rac cytosolic and inactive . Cysmethynil blocks the final CAAX modification step by inhibiting Icmt . NSC23766 inhibits RacGEF activation of Rac , whereas EHT 1864 impairs Rac - GTP formation and prevents Rac binding and activation of downstream effectors . ( B ) Structureof EHT1864 . EHT 1864 : A Novel Rac - Specific Inhibitor 113 Rho GTPase function effectively , as Rho GTPases utilize a multitude of downstream effectors ( Bishop and Hall , 2000 ) . Inhibitors that antagonize Rho GTPases directly would be preferable and exhibit greater specificity and potency ( see Fig . 9 . 1A ) . However , to date , there has been limited success in the identification of inhibitors that specifically interact with small GTPases . One example is the NSC23766 small molecule , which was identified as a cell - permeable compound that inhibits Rac1 binding and activation by Rac - specific RhoGEFs such as Tiam1 or Trio ( Gao et al . , 2004 ) . Previous studies suggested that EHT 1864 is a Rac - specific inhibitor that can inhibit association of Rac with its effector Pak , as well as a variety of downstream Rac signaling pathways ( Desire et al . , 2005 ) ( see Fig . 9 . 1 B ) . However , the precise mechanism by which EHT 1864 can inhibit Rac signaling was unclear . We have further characterized this Rac inhibitor and showed that EHT 1864 binds to Rac1 tightly , locking the Rho GTPase in an inert and inactive state , both in vitro and in vivo ( Shutes et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , EHT 1864 potently inhibited Rac1 - mediated changes in cellular morphology and cellular transformation ( Shutes et al . , 2007 ) . We also demonstrated that in addition to Rac1 , EHT 1864 binds to Rac1b and Rac2 with similar affinity , whereas binding to Rac3 is approximately 10 - fold less , suggesting that EHT 1864 may form the basis for a novel class of specific Rac GTPase inhibitors . This chapter describes some of the techniques used to characterize the mechanism of action of EHT 1864 on Rac1 and its impact on Rac1 - mediated cellular functions . 2 . Experimental Procedures 2 . 1 . In vitro biochemical analyses of the effect of EHT 1864 on Rac GTPase nucleotide association and dissociation A common method for monitoring the process of nucleotide exchange on small GTPases is the use of fluorescent N - methylanthraniloyl ( mant ) deriva - tives of guanine nucleotides . On binding to small GTPases , a change of environment around the mant group , from a solvent quenched to a hydro - phobic environment , causes a significant increase in emitted fluorescence at 440 nm . The mant fluorophore is usually excited directly by 360 - nm light . Rac proteins , however , contain a Trp residue buried in the nucleotide - binding pocket that can be excited at 290 nm and subsequently transfer energy directly to the mant group via fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) producing emission at 440 nm . This method therefore provides a fluorescent readout of a nucleotide - bound state as an average of a population . We have observed that the compound EHT 1864 is intrinsically fluorescent ( Shutes et al . , 2007 ) , and this fluorescence increases on addition of Rac1 in a 114 Cercina Onesto et al . dose - dependent fashion , suggesting that changes in fluorescence relate to a binding event . The excitation and emission maxima of the inhibitor are extremely similar to those of mant nucleotides , and therefore direct measure - ment of changes in mant fluorescence is impossible . This section describes in vitro protocols used to analyze the interaction of EHT 1864 with Rac1 . 2 . 1 . 1 . Measurement of nucleotide k off using Trp - mant FRET analyses Protocols for the expression and purification of a recombinant fusion protein of glutathione S - transferase added to the amino terminus of human Rac1 ( GST - Rac1 ) have been described elsewhere ( Phillips et al . , 2003 ; Shutes et al . , 2002 , 2007 ; Thapar et al . , 2002 ) . For most in vitro studies , it is convenient to purify GST - Rac1 on a glutathione - Sepharose column , for example , a 5 - ml GSTrap - FF column ( Amersham ) . However , to make measurements of off rates , it is convenient to purify the protein in a batch fashion ( where cell lysis supernatant and beads are incubated together ) , where the GST - protein remains attached to glutathione - agarose beads . An average 4 - liter preparation of GST - Rac1 produces approximately 50 mg of purified recombinant protein . The bead - bound protein can then be loaded with the nucleotide by incubation in exchange buffer [ 20 m M Tris - HCl , 50 m M NaCl , 500 m M mant - GDP and mant - GMPPNP ( Roche ) , 20 m M ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ] for 1 min at 37 (cid:2) . The beads are then washed in ice - cold 20 m M Tris - HCl , 50 m M NaCl , and 1 m M MgCl 2 before elution in 20 m M Tris - HCl , 50 m M NaCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , and 0 . 1 m M glutathione for 10 min on ice . The beads and solution should be separated through centrifugation ( 13 , 000 rpm , 1 min ) before removal of the superna - tant to a fresh tube . The loaded protein is best used immediately , although it can be snap frozen in aliquots for use at a later date . We use a SPEX Fluorolog - 3 Research fluorimeter to assess off rates . Data from an example experiment are shown in Fig . 9 . 2A . Rac1 (cid:3) mant - GDP ( 2 m M ) is incubated at 25 (cid:2) in 20 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 50 m M NaCl , and 1 m M MgCl 2 buffer ( to a total volume of 300 m l ) in a 1 - ml quartz cuvette ( with constant stirring ) . The addition of EHT 1864 or EDTA ( to a final concentration of 50 m M or 10 m M , respectively ) is done to begin the reaction . Changes in fluorescence are monitored at l ex ¼ 290 nm and l em ¼ 440 nm , and data are recorded by the supplied software . 2 . 1 . 2 . Measurement of the effect of EHT 1864 on nucleotide association with Rac 1 To examine the inhibition of nucleotide loading by EHT 1864 , Rac1 is incubated with excess mant nucleotide in the presence of excess EHT 1864 . Exchange is then initiated by the addition of EDTA , and the increase in fluorescence through FRET is measured on a Gemini Spectromax 96 - well plate reader . EHT 1864 : A Novel Rac - Specific Inhibitor 115 For these analyses , a 2 (cid:4) nucleotide solution containing 40 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 m M NaCl , 2 m M MgCl 2 , and 4 m M mant - GDP is prepared . Fifty microliters of this solution is then placed into the desired wells of a 96 - well plate ( BD Falcon microtest plate ) . To this , Rac1 (cid:3) GDP is added to a final concentration of 2 m M , EHT 1864 to 50 m M , and the required amount of water to make a total volume of 100 m l within the well .

( A ) Addition of EHT 1864 to Rac1 (cid:3) MantGDP complexes causes loss of the bound nucleotide . Rac1 ( 2 m M ) preloaded with mantGDP was incubated in 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 50 m M NaCl , and 1 m M MgCl 2 . At the desired time , either EDTA or EHT1864 was added to a finalconcentrationof10 m M and 50 m M , respectively .

Incremental1 - m lvolumes of Rac buffer were added to a1 m M solution of EHT1864 ( bothRacandEHT1864werein20 m M Tris - HCl , pH7 . 4 , 50 m M NaCl , and1 m M MgCl 2 ) . The Rac solution also contained 1 m M EHT 1864 . Increases in anisotropy , reflecting increases in Rac (cid:3) inhibitor formation , were followed at l ex ¼ 360 nm and l em ¼ 440 nm . Datawerefittedtoabindingcurve , fromwhicha K D canbeestimated . 116 Cercina Onesto et al . The mixture is allowed to incubate until any small disturbances in the fluorescence ( l ex 290 nm , l em 440 nm ) settle ( usually a couple of minutes ) . Exchange is then initiated by the addition of 1 m l of 500 m M EDTA to provide a final concentration of 5 m M . Changes in fluorescence are then followed in a kinetic fashion so that single exponential curves can be fit to data produced ( see Fig . 9 . 2 B ) . 2 . 1 . 3 . Measurement of EHT 1864 binding to Rac 1 EHT 1864 is fluorescent in solution and this fluorescence changes on the addition of protein to this solution . This suggests that the fluorescence is affected by direct protein association . The increase in fluorescence is suffi - cient ( 30 % ) to provide information on inhibitor binding to various Rac isoforms , as well as Cdc42 . 2 . 1 . 3 . 1 . EHT 1864 excitation and emission spectra A 1 - ml cuvette of a SPEX Fluorolog - 3 Research fluorimeter containing a 10 m M solution of EHT 1864 in 20 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 50 m M NaCl , and 1 m M MgCl 2 buffer is used to generate emission spectra . Emission and excitation spectra are collected by scanning through excitation and emission wavelengths to determine the values at which excitation and emission are at a maximum ( see Fig . 9 . 2C ) . Optimal l ex and l em are found to be 360 and 440 nm , respectively . 2 . 1 . 3 . 2 . Estimation of K D of EHT / small GTPase interaction Since we have established that binding of EHT 1864 to Rac1 causes a change in fluorescence of the inhibitor , we can monitor this change to determine a binding curve for the interaction . This can be done by titration of GTPase ( at a known concentration ) into a known concentration of inhibitor . The increases in fluorescence can then be followed at l ex ¼ 360 nm and l em ¼ 440 nm . An example of a binding curve is shown in Fig . 9 . 2D . For these analyses , a 1 m M solution of EHT 1864 in a 20 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 50 m M NaCl , and 1 m M MgCl 2 buffer is added to a 1 - ml cuvette ( total volume is 300 m l ) with stirring in a SPEX Fluorolog - 3 Research fluorimeter in the T - format . Using a 10 - m l Hamilton glass syringe , 1 m l of Rho GTPase ( in GDP - bound form ) is titrated into the inhibitor solution , and the increase in anisotropy ( l ex ¼ 360 nm , l em ¼ 440 nm ) is monitored . The value of increased anisotropy is read 90 s after each addition of Rho GTPase to allow for an equilibration period . Assuming a 1 : 1 interaction between the inhibitor and Rho GTPase , these values are plotted and fitted to a binding curve , from which a K D is calculated . For these analyses , it is important to remember to ‘‘spike’’ the Rho GTPase stock solutions with inhibitor ( to a final concen - tration of 1 m M ) so that no inhibitor dilution effect occurs in the titration . EHT 1864 : A Novel Rac - Specific Inhibitor 117 2 . 2 . Effect of EHT 1864 on cellular Rac 1 activity and cell transformation As mentioned previously , EHT 1864 reduces the association of activated Rac1 - GTP with the isolated GTPase binding domain ( RBD ) of its effector , Pak1 ( Pak - RBD ) , whereas it has no effect on binding of the GTP - bound form of the related Rho GTPase , RhoA , to the isolated RBD of the RhoA effector , Rhotekin ( Desire et al . , 2005 ) . We have also found that EHT 1864 treatment does not affect the interaction of Cdc42 with the Pak - RBD ( Shutes et al . , 2007 ) , clearly demonstrating the specificity of interaction of EHT 1864 with Rac1 and not related Rho GTPases . By further delineating the specificity of EHT 1864 interaction with Rho family GTPases within mammalian cells , we also demonstrated that EHT 1864 is an effective inhibitor of Rac1 - mediated and not RhoA - or Cdc42 - mediated cellular events ( Shutes et al . , 2007 ) . This section describes the techniques designed to study the impact of EHT 1864 on cellular Rac1 activity and cell transformation . 2 . 2 . 1 . EHT 1864 inhibition of Rac 1 - mediated morphological changes Rho GTPases are activated by extracellular stimuli , and specific Rho GTPases are regulators of distinct changes in actin cytoskeletal reorganiza - tion . Platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) activates Rac1 and promotes Rac - mediated formation of actin - rich membrane lamellipodia ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) , whereas lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) causes activation of RhoA and RhoA - dependent formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) and bradykinin causes activation of Cdc42 and Cdc42 - dependent formation of actin microspikes and finger - like membrane protrusions known as filopodia ( Kozma et al . , 1995 ) . Hence , we evaluated the ability of EHT 1864 to selectively block ligand - stimulated activation of Rac1 in NIH / 3T3 cells . 2 . 2 . 1 . 1 . Cell culture NIH / 3T3 mouse fibroblasts are a well - characterized cellular model used to visualize Rho GTPase - stimulated actin cytoskeleton rearrangements . NIH / 3T3 cells are grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % calf serum ( CS ; Colorado Serum Company ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 10 m g / ml streptomycin and are maintained at 37 (cid:2) in a humidified 10 % ( v / v ) CO 2 incubator . NIH / 3T3 cells are plated onto 15 - mm circular glass coverslips ( Fisher ) at 2 (cid:4) 10 4 cells per well in 12 - well plates . Twenty - four hours after plating , the cultures are rinsed twice with serum - free basal medium and switched to DMEM sup - plemented with 0 . 5 % CS for 16 h to serum starve the cells to decrease basal Rac1 activity . For the last 4 h of this serum - starvation step , the cells are then incubated in growth medium supplemented with 5 m M of EHT 1864 or EHT 8560 . EHT 8560 is a compound structurally related to EHT 1864 , but 118 Cercina Onesto et al . is unable to inhibit Rac1 association with Pak - RBD and therefore serves as a negative control ( Shutes et al . , 2007 ) . At the end of the starvation period , cells are stimulated with 5 ng / ml of PDGF , 40 ng / ml of LPA , or 100 ng / ml of bradykinin ( all from Sigma ) for 15 min , then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described next . 2 . 2 . 1 . 2 . Immunofluorescence and microscopy analysis All steps in the immunostaining procedure are performed at room temperature . Cells plated on coverslips are rinsed twice with room temperature phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and are fixed for 15 min with a fresh preparation of 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS . After rinsing with PBS , cells are permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min , washed three times with PBS , and incubated with Alexa 568 - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 / 40 dilution ; Invitrogen ) for 30 min . Phalloi - din is a useful reagent for visualizing the distribution of F - actin in cells and hence to study actin networks at high resolution . Because phalloidin is conjugated to a light - sensitive fluorophore , coverslips should be protected from light from this step on . After two final washes in PBS and one in distilled water , coverslips are then mounted onto microscope slides with FluorSave reagent ( Calbiochem ) to prevent photobleaching . The slides should be maintained in the dark at room temperature for at least 1 h to allow the mounting reagent to dry and can be analyzed immediately or stored in a light - tight box at – 20 (cid:2) for a period of few months . Although standard fluorescence microscopy with digital image acquisi - tion is sufficient to visualize changes in the actin cytoskeleton , we use a Zeiss LSM 510 laser - scanning confocal microscope to achieve the best resolution . Images are collected using an oil immersion 63 (cid:4) NA 1 . 4 objective . Images are captured by scanning with the 543 - nm spectral line of the HeNe1 laser and emission filter LP 585 . As shown in Fig . 9 . 3A , stimulation of cells with PDGF efficiently induces membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation , and this activity is almost completely blocked by treatment with EHT 1864 but not by the related but inactive EHT 8560 compound . EHT 1864 - treated cells show an approximately 80 % reduction in response to PDGF stimulation of lamellipodia formation ( see Fig . 9 . 3 B ) . In contrast , treatment with EHT 1864 does not affect LPA - mediated actin stress fiber formation or bradykinin - mediated filopodia formation ( data not shown ) , clearly demonstrating that EHT 1864 is a potent and specific inhibitor of ligand - induced endogenous Rac1 activation and lamellipodia formation in NIH / 3T3 cells . 2 . 2 . 2 . EHT 1864 inhibition of Rac 1 : Pak 1 complex formation To further confirm the activity of EHT 1864 within cells , we coexpressed constitutively activated Rac1 ( 61L ) with GFP - Pak - RBD in NIH / 3T3 cells . GFP - Pak - RBD is a useful tool to study the subcellular localization of EHT 1864 : A Novel Rac - Specific Inhibitor 119 activated Rac small GTPases within cells because it provides a probe to detect the plasma membrane - associated , ectopically expressed , activated Rac1 - GTP ( Chenette et al . , 2006 ) . In cells transfected with both constructs , the location of the GFP - Pak - RBD reflects its ability to associate with the activated Rac1 protein . In the absence of coexpressed activated Rac1 ( 61L ) , the GFP - Pak - RBD probe is diffuse . NIH / 3T3 cells plated on glass cover - slips as described earlier are transfected with the relevant constructs using LipofectAmine Plus reagent ( Invitrogen ) and the manufacturer’s protocol and are incubated in growth medium supplemented with 0 . 5 % CS . Sixteen hours after transfection , cells are treated with 50 m M EHT 1864 for specific time periods , washed , and fixed . Cells are then examined for localization of the GFP - Pak - RBD , as well as for their overall cell morphology ( see Fig . 9 . 3C ) . We use a Leica DMIRB inverted fluorescent microscope at l ex ¼ 480 nm and l em ¼ 520 nm , and images are captured using a black and white high - sensitivity Hamamatsu charge - coupled device camera .

We observed that in the absence of inhibitor treatment , GFP - Pak - RBD is found enriched in cell ruffles , around the plasma membrane , as well as within a variety of internal membrane structures . This pattern corresponds to the subcellular localization of Rac1 . In the presence of EHT 1864 , within 4 h of treatment , membrane localization of the GFP - Pak - RBD is lost , resulting in a more cytosolic distribution ( see Fig . 9 . 3 C ) , demonstrating that EHT 1864 treatment disrupts Rac1 interaction with downstream effectors . 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 C B h : GFP 0 DIC 4 8 % ce ll s w it h l a m e lli pod i a PDGF EHT 1864 Vehicle EHT 1864 EHT 8560 Figure 9 . 3 EHT1864iseffectiveinspecificallyinhibitingPDGF - inducedlamellipodia formation . ( A ) PDGF - induced actin reorganization is inhibited by EHT 1864 . After overnight serum starvation in growth medium alone or supplemented with 5 m M EHT 1864 or EHT 8560 for the last 4 h of incubation , NIH / 3T3 cultures were treated with 5 ng / ml PDGF for 15 min and then fixed , and actin filaments were visualized with Alexa - phalloidin .

NIH / 3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with expression constructs encoding Rac1 ( 61L ) or GFP - Pak - RBD . Cells were then maintained in growth medium supplemented with 0 . 5 % calf serum and incubated with EHT 1864 for specific time periods . Cells were then washed and fixed for analysis on an inverted fluorescent microscope ( l ex ¼ 480 nm l em ¼ 520 nm ) . EHT 1864 : A Novel Rac - Specific Inhibitor 121 2 . 2 . 3 . EHT 1864 inhibition of Rac 1 - mediated cellular transformation Because previous studies showed that endogenous Rac1 activity is essential for Ras - induced growth transformation of rodent fibroblasts ( Khosravi - Far et al . , 1995 ; Qiu et al . , 1995 ) , we examined the ability of EHT 1864 to inhibit Ras - mediated transformation of NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts . 2 . 2 . 3 . 1 . Cell culture NIH / 3T3 mouse fibroblasts have been used exten - sively as a tool to study Ras - mediated morphological transformation ( focus formation assays ) and anchorage - independent growth ( soft agar assays ) ( Clark et al . , 1995 ) . These cells have a low level of spontaneous transformation and display density - dependent growth inhibition when maintained at confluent cell densities . However , the proper maintenance of stock cultures of NIH / 3T3 cells is essential to avoid problems that can hinder reproducible , quantitative transformation assays . Because they are preneoplastic cells that are highly sensitive to the one - hit transforming actions of many different oncoproteins , they are prone to spontaneous transformation if they are allowed to persist at confluent densities . More - over , it is important to be aware that there are many different strains of NIH / 3T3 cells that may not behave similarly in transformation assays . The NIH / 3T3 cells that we use routinely ( sometimes referred to as the UNC strain ) are propagated as described previously , following the protocols described previously ( Clark et al . , 1995 ; Solski et al . , 2000 ) . The source of the calf serum used for cell growth is also very critical . The frequency of spontaneous transformation , as well as oncogenic Ras focus - forming ability , can vary widely with different serum lots . Therefore , we routinely test serum lots from various vendors . We have found that calf serum from the Colorado Serum Company consistently supports excellent Ras - induced focus formation and minimum background spontaneous focus formation activity . 2 . 2 . 3 . 2 . Establishment of oncogenic Ras - transformed NIH / 3 T 3 fibroblasts Several DNA transfection methods can be used for the intro - duction of plasmid DNA into cells . For these analyses , we chose the Lipo - fectamine transfection method ( using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent ; Invitrogen ) to establish cells stably transfected with a plasmid expression vector encoding a constitutively activated , highly transforming mutant of human H - Ras [ with a Gln61 to Leu mutation ; designated H - Ras ( 61L ) ] into NIH / 3T3 mouse fibroblasts . One day before transfection , NIH / 3T3 cells are plated at a subconfluent density ( 4 (cid:4) 10 5 cells per 100 - mm dish ) and incubated overnight to allow adhesion and cell spreading . On the next day , cultures are transfected with 4 m g of the pCGN – hygro mammalian expres - sion vector encoding the constitutively active hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged 122 Cercina Onesto et al . H - Ras ( 61L ) protein . Parallel cultures are transfected with the empty vector to monitor the appearance of spontaneous focus - forming activity . Fresh growth medium is added 6 h after adding the DNA - Lipofectamine 2000 complexes to the cells . Two days after transfection , one - third of transfected cells are replated into a 100 - mm plate containing growth medium supple - mented with 200 m g / ml hygromycin B ( Roche ) . After 14 days , several hundred drug - resistant colonies are then trypsinized and pooled together to be expanded , with one - tenth of the culture replated into another 100 - mm plate containing growth medium supplemented with hygromycin B . The stable expression of HA - H - Ras ( 61L ) within the cells is evaluated by Western blot analysis using the anti - HA antibody ( clone 3F10 , Roche ) , as shown in Fig . 9 . 4A . This mass population of stably transfected cells is then used in focus formation assays and soft agar assays in order to determine the impact of the compound EHT 1864 on the transforming activity of H - Ras ( 61L ) . 2 . 2 . 3 . 3 . Focus formation assay The NIH / 3T3 focus formation assay is a widely used and well - established biological assay that measures the ability of an exogenously expressed gene to promote morphologic and growth trans - formation , in particular , a loss of density - dependent inhibition of growth . It is probably the most commonly used assay for examining the transforming potential of a particular oncogene in NIH / 3T3 cells . There are two types of focus formation assays : primary and secondary . In the primary focus forma - tion assay , the ability of the oncogene to transform cells is assessed by transfected cells , allowing the transfected cultures to reach confluency and to form foci of multilayered cells , which is indicative of the loss of density - dependent growth . In the secondary focus formation assay , populations of cells stably expressing a protein of interest are established first and then mixed to untransfected NIH / 3T3 , and the efficiency of the stably transfected cells to form foci of transformed cells is measured in confluent cultures . Here we describe results using a secondary focus formation assay and we have obtained similar results using primary focus formation assays ( Shutes et al . , 2007 ) . For this type of assay , a sufficient number of dishes are plated to perform the assay with duplicate dishes for each condition tested . A single cell suspension of 5 (cid:4) 10 2 cells stably expressing empty pCGN - hygro ( as a control ) or pCGN - H - Ras ( 61L ) is mixed with a suspension of 5 (cid:4) 10 5 parental NIH / 3T3 cells and then plated into each well of six - well plates . The ability of H - Ras ( 61L ) - expressing cells to form multilayered colonies of cells is reflected by the appearance of foci of densely packed cells that can be visualized readily within the monolayer of untransformed , contact - inhibited NIH / 3T3 cells . The cultures are fed every other day with fresh growth medium supple - mented or not with 5 m M of the compound EHT 1864 . Ras - induced trans - formed foci are visible after 10 to 14 days and are subsequently quantified . The EHT 1864 : A Novel Rac - Specific Inhibitor 123 most accurate quantification of foci is performed by visual inspection of live cultures under an inverted phase - contrast microscope at 4 (cid:4) magnification . The cultures can then be quantitated for the appearance of foci of transformed Vector H - Ras ( 61L ) Vector H - Ras ( 61L ) Vehicle EHT 1864 B F o c i p e r d i s h 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 EHT 1864 : Vector − + H - Ras ( 61L ) − + C H - R a s ( 61 L ) A 30 21 . 5 46 MW ( kDa ) V ec t o r a - HA a - b - actin Figure 9 . 4 EHT 1864 blocks oncogenic Ras - stimulated cell transformation . ( A ) Expression level of H - Ras ( 61L ) in stably transfected NIH / 3T3 cells . The expression of HA epitope - tagged H - Ras ( 61L ) protein was detected by blot analysis using an anti - HA antibody ( clone 3F10 ; Roche Diagnostics ) . Blot analysis for b - actin ( clone AC15 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was also done to verify equivalent total protein loading . ( B ) EHT 1864 inhibition of Ras - induced formation of foci of transformed cells . NIH / 3T3 cells stably transfected with the empty pCGN - hygro ( vector ) or encoding H - Ras ( 61L ) were plated and allowed to reach confluency . Cells were cultured in 10 % serum growth medium , either alone or supplemented with 5 m M EHT 1864 . The appearance of foci of trans - formed cells was quantitated 14 days after plating . Cells were then fixed and stained with crystal violet . ( C ) Quantitation of data shown in B . Data shown are representative of twoindependentexperiments , eachperformed induplicate . 124 Cercina Onesto et al . cells . The cultures can also then be subjected to fixation and staining with crystal violet for permanent storage of the cultures . For cell fixation , cells are rinsed once with room temperature PBS , and then 2 ml of a fixing solution containing 10 % acetic acid and 10 % methanol in water is added to each well for 10 min . The fixative is then removed , and cells are stained by adding 2 ml of crystal violet 0 . 4 % ( diluted in ethanol ) per well for 5 min . Stained cells are rinsed with distilled water thoroughly but carefully , taking care to preserve the thin monolayer of cells . An example of Ras - induced foci is illustrated in Fig . 9 . 4B , which shows that EHT 1864 treatment causes an essentially com - plete inhibition of Ras - induced focus formation activity . 2 . 2 . 3 . 4 . Soft agar assay Colony formation in soft agar is the most widely used assay to evaluate anchorage - independent growth potential and repre - sents one of the best in vitro assays that correlates strongly with in vivo tumorigenic cell growth potential . Like normal cells , untransformed NIH / 3T3 cells require adherence and spreading onto a solid substratum in order to remain viable and proliferate . In contrast , transformed NIH / 3T3 cells lose this requirement and therefore can form proliferating colonies of cells when suspended in a semisolid agar medium . To evaluate the impact of EHT 1864 treatment on Ras - mediated colony formation in soft agar , we used a protocol that has been described previously ( Solski et al . , 2000 ) . We performed this assay in six - well plates using triplicate wells for each condition evaluated . Briefly , a 0 . 6 % Bacto agar ( BD Biosciences ) bottom layer ( prepared in NIH / 3T3 growth medium supplemented or not with 5 m M EHT 1864 ) is poured first and allowed to harden ( 2 . 5 ml per well ) . NIH / 3T3 cells stably transfected with the empty pCGN - hygro plasmid ( Vector ) or encoding H - Ras ( 61L ) are trypsinized to generate a single cell suspension . It is important at this step to confirm that cells are a uniform single - cell suspension . Cells ( 5 (cid:4) 10 3 per well ) are resuspended in 0 . 4 % agar supplemented with complete growth medium or are supplemented addi - tionally with 5 m M EHT 1864 to form the top layer ( 0 . 25 ml per well ) . After overnight solidification of the agar top layer , 0 . 25 ml of growth medium supplemented or not with 5 m M EHT 1864 is added to the top of each well . The medium is then changed every other day to continuously maintain the cells in the presence of fresh EHT 1864 . Whereas untrans - formed NIH / 3T3 cells do not form colonies in soft agar , Ras - transformed NIH / 3T3 cells form colonies of proliferating cells that can be detected readily within a week . When the colonies are large enough to be stained ( typically after 16 days ) , the medium is removed , and 0 . 25 ml per well of a 2 - mg / ml solution of thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) ( Sigma ) is added to the cells and incubated at least 1 h at 37 (cid:2) before the plates are scanned . Colonies are scored by counting the whole well for each condition under a microscope . As shown in Fig . 9 . 5 . the EHT 1864 compound partially inhibits oncogenic Ras - induced anchorage - independent growth EHT 1864 : A Novel Rac - Specific Inhibitor 125 of NIH / 3T3 cells . Therefore , results obtained with both focus formation assays and soft agar assays suggest that EHT 1864 impairs Ras - mediated cellular transformation . 3 . Concluding Remarks This chapter presented methods to characterize Rho GTPase specific - ity and biochemical and cellular mechanisms of action of EHT 1864 , a lead compound that specifically inhibits Rac GTPases by binding directly to Rac1 ( and potentially to other members of the Rac family ) and placing it in an inert and inactive state . We also found that EHT 1864 has also been Vector H - Ras ( 61L ) Vector H - Ras ( 61L ) Vehicle EHT 1864 C o l on i e s p e r d i s h 25 20 15 10 5 0 EHT 1864 : Vector − + H - Ras ( 61L ) − + A B Figure 9 . 5 EHT 1864 partially inhibits oncogenic Ras - induced anchorage - independent growth of NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts .

Future analyses of EHT 1864 activity will include studies of Rac function inhibition in human tumor cell lines with validated activated Rac , using both cell culture and mouse models . In summary , the current lack of identification of successful inhibi - tors that selectively target small GTPases is surprising given the amount of current knowledge on their structure and functions . Because of its specific - ity of action toward Rac GTPases , EHT 1864 may represent in the future a useful tool for modulating aberrant Rac activities in therapeutics .
