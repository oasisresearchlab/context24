DCE 9Dec83 1743PST Authorship Provisions In AUGMENT Douglas Engelbart Tymshare Inc Cupertino CA Journal December 1983 Note Published in COMPCON 84 Digest Proceedings of the 1984 COMPCON Conference San Francisco CA February 27 March pp 465 472 Also published in Computer Supported Cooperative Work book of Readings Irene Grezf Morgan inann Publishers Inc San Mateo CA 1988 pp 107126 ABSTRACT AUGMENT is text processing system marketed by Tymshare for multiuser network environment In AUGMENTs frontend is User Interface System that facilitates flexible evolution of command lan guages and provides optional command recognition features Exceptionally fast and flexible control of interactive operations is enabled by concurrent ac tion of mouse and optional onehanded chord keyset Files are hierarchically structured and textual address expressions can flexibly specify any text entity in any file The screen may be divided into arbitrary rectangular windows allowing crossfile editing between windows Many options exist for controlling the view of files text in window eg level clipping paragraph truncation and content filtering Structural study and modifi cation of online documents are especially facifi tated Journal system and Shared Screen Tele conferencing support collaboration among authors and their colleagues Graphic illustrations may be embedded in the same file with text ION AUGMENT was designed for augmenting human intellectual capabilities It was targeted particu larly toward the core work of professionals engaged in tough knowledge workeg planning ana lyzing and designing in complex problem domains And special attention was paid to augmenting group collaboration among workers pursuing common goals Authorship has received great deal of attention in AUGMENTs evolution as one of the central hu man activities to be augmented An important set of provisions within AUGMENTin its architecture design principles and specific featuresis directly aimed toward bringing high performance to the authorship activities of knowledge workers For the purposes of this paper we thus speak inter changeably of knowledge worker and author We recognize explicitly that highly skilled work ers in any field and knowledge work is no excep tion are those with good command of their tools Our basic design goal was to provide set of tools that would not themselves limit the capabilities of the people using them system designed to en courage more skilled workers will always enable higher human performance than one designed to support less skilled workers In this regard our design goal was to provide as much capability as possible for each level of sys tem usage skill and continuous evolution path between skill levels We believe firmly that knowledge workers are motivated to grow in knowledge and skill and that provisions in system design should support this As the rest of the paper reveals this approach translates into rich set of AUGMENT provisions aimed at providing speed and flexibility for skilled workers in organizing and pursuing their core knowledge workin which authorship is primary An explicit subgoal in AUGMENTs development was to augment the development production and control of complex technical documentation through the whole cycle of gathering information planning creating collaborating reviewing edit ing controlling versions designing layout and producing the final documents This paper concentrates upon the development phase of this cycle AUGMENT has welldevel oped tools to support the later production phase but their discussion is not included here Studying anothers work provides wellrecog nized challenge but one of the toughest jobs is to 3d Si Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT DCE 9Dec83 43 225 study ones

before it is polished ie before it is well structured coherently worded nonredundant and consistently termed SOME BACKGROUND HISTORY AUGMENT is an integrated system of knowledge worker tools that is marketed by sh Office Automation Division The system was developed at SRI International over an extended period under the sponsorship of NASA DARPA and RADC Commercial rights were transferred to Tymshare in 1978 where the system has since been renamed from NLS to AUGMENT and its evolution contin ued short history of AUGMENTs development may be found in Refi along with summary of system characteristics and features The general RD philosophy and the design principles behind AUGMENTS development are laid out in cRef24a1 The system evolved on timeshared mainframe computers and in packetswitched network envi ronment In 1970 our computer was the second to be attached to the ARPANET and since 1978 we have also operated extensively in the TYMNET envi ronment We have benefited directly from both the timesharing and the network environments in mat ters that are important to the authorship process especially in dealing with large documents and multiparty documentation activities In 197677 we conducted some applled studies for the Air Force as reported in cRef3 and Ref4 which concentrated upon this latter application RELEVANT ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES Perhaps AUGMENTs most unique architectural feature is its User Interface System UlS special software module which handles the humancom puter interfaces to all interactive programs It takes care of all commandlanguage dialog and connection protocols and provides framework for building coherent and integrated user environment while supporting flexible evolution on both sides on the users side with evolution of command function and terminology and on the technology side with evolving hardware and software Design details are outlined in cRef5 rationale and utilization in Ref6 The lS provides reachthrough service to non AUGMENT systems and can optionally translate back and forth to foreign programs command lan guage It also supports the sharedscreen remote collaboration capability discussed below 3g AUGMENTs architecture provides for openended expansion and flexible evolution of system func tionality and worker command languages 4b2 4b3 4a It is assumed that for any class of knowledge work ers specialized application systems developed by other parties perhaps running on other computers will provide services worth integrating The author class of worker should be no exception Continuing evolution toward the author workshop of the future will certainly depend upon some such features in workshop architecture It provides adaptation for different terminal char acteristics enabling application programers to work as though with virtual terminal FILE CHARACTERISTICS 4b4 455 4c AUGMENT employs explicitly structured files with hierarchically organized nodes each node can contain either or all of up to 2000 characters of text graphic structure or other forms of useful data eg digitized speech The worker has definite model in mind for the structuring of any file that he works with in composing and modify ing it he can organize and modify structure using the same verbs as for working with text strings eg Insert Replace Move Copy Delete with appro priate structuralentity nouns eg Statement Branch Group Plex For any existing hierarchical structure he has many flexible alternatives for ad 4a2 dressing its entities modifying its organization jumping around within it and viewing it in most beneficial manner Note AUGMENT workers generally use the term statement to refer to file node which is natural enough since the terminology became established before we added the graphic capability Now an AUGMENT statement can contain either or both text statement and graphic diagram CONTROLLING THE TOOLS Many of AUGMENTs unique authorsupport provi sions address basic operations common to almost every task things done over and over again These 4c2 DCE 9Dec83 1743PST OAD2250 Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT operations executed with speed and flexibility provide for composing and modifying ones working material and for studying what is there over wide range of substantive levelsfrom single text passage to collection of endproduct draft docu ments and their associated set of working notes ref erence material and recordedmessage dialog assuming all to be on line In the early stages of our program at SM we did great deal of detailed work on what we called the control interfacehow users control the func tional application of their tools These details can be very important to lowlevel interactions which are done hundreds of times during working day Some of these details are quite relevant to bringing high performance to the authorship process AUGMENT commands are expressed with verbs nouns and appropriate qualifier words every com mand word is designated by entering one or more characters The lS recognizes the command word from these characters according to the command recognition options designated in each individuals profile file Users seem to migrate fairly rapidly to expert recognition modes where minimum number of characters will elicit recognition of command words The fully spelledout command words are presented in the Command Feedback Window as soon as they are recognized The Backspace Key wifi cause backup one command word at time Of the system requirements behind our choice of this nounverb command form two are particularly relevant here The vocabulary of the functions of the tools and of the entities they operate upon must be as extensible as is natural language Textual lists of commands must conveniently lend themselves to writing documenting and executing as macro commands Screen selection is done with mouse If the com mands noun is single defined text or structure en tity eg word then there is only one selection needed eg to pick any character in the desig nated word Besides using standard keyboard for character entry an AUGMENT user may optionally use fivekey onehand chord keyset Remarkably lit tle practice is required in order to enter alphabetic characters one handstroke per character With less than five hours practice person can begin profitably working in twohanded concurrent modeoperating the mouse with one hand and si multaneously entering command characters and short literal strings with the other hand 5a Here is an example of lowlevel action which reveals some basic characteristics of highper formance execution It is very simple situation but representative of what is met over and over and over again in doing hard knowledge work The worker is composing or modifying something in one area of the screen when his eye catches one character typo in another area For skilled AUGMENT worker the typo could be corrected in less time than it would take someone to point it out to himwith three quick strokes of the keyset hand during casual ifick of the mouse hand and an absolute minimum of visual and mental attention taken from the other ongoing task 5g Fast flexible graceful low effortthese are im portant to all highfrequency lowlevel knowl edgework actions This same kind of speed and flexibility are achieved by skilled AUGMENT workers in executing all of the other functional fea tures described below Description of mouse and keyset and their concurrent employment may be found in Ref7 ADDRESSING THE WORKING MATERIALS There is consistent set of addressing features that worker may use in any command to designate particular structural node or some element of text or graphics attached to that node It adds appre ciably to the power and flexibility of the system commands to have rich universally applicable vocabulary for directly addressing particular enti ties within the working files Below are some examples EXPLICIT STATEMENTADDRESSES There are four handles by which given state ment may be directly addressed Structural Statement Number This designates the current structural location of the statement It is assigned by the system depending upon where the worker installs or moves statement within an existing structure or how that structure might have been reorganized subsequently It is usually 51 5h 5c 6a Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT DCE 9Dec83 1743PST QAD2250 expressed as an alternating sequence of numberlet ter fieldseg la lal 1a2 and lb At workers option these same statement numbers could be shown as or 12 but this bulkier alternative is seldom chosen 6b2 Statement Identifier or SID This is unique integer assigned in sequential order by the system as each statement is first inserted and which stays with statement no matter how much its content may be altered or where it may be moved in its file structure To make it uniquely recognizable for what it is SD is always displayed printed or desig nated with prefixed 0eg 012 0417 etc SIDs are particularly useful for referencing pas sages in document while it is evolving WorkerAssigned Statement Name or label For any statement or part of the file structure an author can designate as name delimiters pair of characters that indicate to the system when the first word of statement is to be treated as name for that statement For instance if and are set by the author as name delimiters for specified part of the file any parenthesized first word in statement would be recognized by the system as that statements name Note It is optional whether to have any of the above three identifiers displayed or printed with the statements text Direct Screen Selection When statement to be designated is displayed in window usually the best way to address it is to use the mouse to position the cursor anywhere on the statement and depress the mouses Select key indicated below by Select This mode is generally used for text manipulationselecting characters words num bers visibles invisibles etc any of the text enti ties which have been made system recognizable MARKERS As one holds place in book by leaving tem porary place marker in it an author can place markers at arbitrary locations within an AUGMENT file When placing marker he at taches it to specific character in the text and gives it name or label Marker names are local to each file Simple commands provide for displaying where ones markers are located and what their names are for deleting or moving marker or for installing new one marker name may be included in an address ex pression to provide another way of designating an address marker name can designate not only particular statement but specific character within that statement For example Copy Word to follow word Select would designate that word located somewhere in the file and marked with an is to be copied to follow the cursorselected word There are many unique ways in which markers may be employed by an author who has integrated their artful use into her work ing methodology As comparative example of some of the foregoing addressing forms consider statement whose SID is 069 whose statement number is 3b5 that has statementname delimiters designated for it as NULL and that starts with the text Capacity For every and that has marker named positioned on one of its characters command to move this statement could optionally be expressed as c3 Move Statement Select Move Statement 3b5 Move Statement 069 Move Statement Capacity or Move Statement RELATIVEADDRESS EXTENSIONS 6W sequence of characters may be appended to the address of given statement to specify an address of position relative to that statement major class of these designations deals with relative structural location such as Up level Down level Successor at same level Predecessor at same level Head at this level Tail at this level and End statement at last and lowest position in this branch period in the address string indi cates that relative addressing is beginning and each of these relativelocation designators is indi cated with directly mnemonic oneletter designation For example Move Statement 0609 to follow statement 4bdt would move Statement 0609 to follow the tail statement of the substructure one level down from Statement 4bor to conceptualize the associated addresslocation pathway go to 4b then Down level and to the Tail 6d2 EMBEDDED CITATION LINKS special use of address expressions is within an explicit text entity that we call Citation Link 6c2 6c3a Sb 6c3c c3 DCE 9Dec83 PSTh 225 Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT or Link for short Links are used as textual cita tions to some specific file item within the work shop domain link is delimited by parentheses or angle brackets and contains valid address string whose path leads to the cited file entity For example 0306 or 4bdt are valid links Also the reference items at the end of this paper are statements named Refi Ref2 etc and as such can be cited with links Refi Ref2 etc An AUGMENT reader may travel via such link directly to the referenced bibliographic citation special feature in AUGMENTs link provisions is the use of indirect link referencing In pathfol lowing terms including in an address string stipulates scan forward from this point to the next link and follow that link to its target For exam ple to follow the path prescribed by link 4bl one would go to 4b then find the first link in that statement and follow the path that it specifies This latter path in turn could prescribe use of an other link etc There is no intrinsic limit to the number of these indirect links that may be employ ed in given pathonly natural caution against such path looping back upon itself As an example note that Refi is link to the statement named Refi bibliographic citation at the end of this paper In that citation there is link to the original source document of the refer enced publication permanently stored in the AUGMENT Journal as Item 12 the Journal is described below The point to be made here is that with the link Refil can reference the original source documentand Jump Link com mand would take me there TEXT AND CONTENT ADDRESSING Other addressing options include scanning for con tent match andor stepping backward and forward given number of characters or words or other text entities For instance the foregoing link could have involved bit more smarts in designating which link to follow eg the path for 4b would be to 4b scan for first occurrence of then follow the next link found in that statement OTHERFILE ADDRESSING By preceding an infile address string with file address and separating the two strings with comma one obtains composite address designating given entity within given file Extending this eel principle lets one prefix the file name with di rectory name in which the file is to be found and further one can prefix this with hostcomputer name For example Office5 ProgramDocumentation SequenceDoc Specifications Journal specifies the path to the OfficeS host computer to its Pro gramDocumentation file directory to its Sequence Doc file to its statement named Specifications and then scan to the location of the text Journal If person were working on the Office5 host he would only have to specify ProgramDocumenta tion SequenceDoc Specifications Journal If he were already working within file with its link default set to the ProgramDocumentation directory he would only have to specify SequenceDoc Specifications Journal And if he were already working within the SequenceDoc file he would only have to specify Specifications Journal And if he were planning to reference items relative to the Statement named Specifica tions very often he could affix marker eg named to its front and would then only have to specify Journal Or suppose he were working in another file in different directory on OfficeS and wanted to ref erence items relative to that same far off state ment with special ease in some temporary place in that file he could install statement named Ref for example containing the textual link ProgramDocumentation SequenceDoc Specifi cations He could then cite the above reference with the link Refl Journal This path de scription is go to the statement in this file named Ref take the first link that you find there traveling across intervening directories and files and statements and beginning in the statement on the other end of that link scan forward to the string Journal 6g3 6g4 This is only cursory treatment but should illus trate well enough what is meant by rich and flexible addressing vocabulary As with other highperformance features in AUGMENT begin ner is not forced to become involved in the larger vocabulary in order to do useful work with produc tivity on at least par with some other restricted vocabulary system But an AUGMENT worker in terested in higher performance can steadily pick up more of the optional vocabulary and skills in smooth upwardcompatible progression Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT DCE 9Dec83 OAD2250 CONTROLLING THE VIEWS user of book or of most online text systems is constrained to viewing the text as though he had window through which he sees fixed formatted document But as described below our worker can view section of text in many ways depending upon his need of the moment 7a MULTIPLE WINDOWS For whatever total screen area is available to the worker his general performance will be improved significantly if he can flexibly allocate that area into arbitrarysized windows whose contents can be independently controlled AUGMENT has long provided this basic capability along with the provision that material from any accessible file may be shown in any window and also that screen select copying or moving can be done across the dif ferent windows Note Crossfile editing can be done at any time between any two legally accessible files If one or the other files material or destination is not being displayed in any of the windows one may always opt to employ textual address expression instead of Select within any editing command Useradjustable parameters are used to control the view presented on the display Adjusting ones view parameters is constantly used AUGMENT feature that has solidly proved its value To facilitate their quick and flexible use the viewspecification actions evolved into cryptic singlecharacter codes called viewspecs The syntax of all Jump com mands used for traveling includes the option of designating new viewspecs and special combina tion of mouse buttons enables quick concurrent keyset action to change the viewspecs for given window Here are few of the frequently used view controls 7b3 WINDOW VIEWS Structure Cutoff Show only the statements that lie below this statement in the structure ie this branch or show only those following statements that are at this level or deeper or show all of the following statements that will fit in this window 7cl Level Clipping For the designated structure cutoff show only the statements down to specified level Lowerlevel statements are clipped from the view the worker can thus view just selected number of the upper levels of his documentifie 7c2 Statement Truncation For those statements brought into view as selected by other view speci fications show only their first lines Truncation to one line is often used along with level clipping in order to get an effective overview InterStatement Separation For viewing ease blank lines can be optionally installed between statements 7c4 Note The foregoing view controls are extremely helpful when studying and modifying documents structural organization 7c5 Statement Numbers and Names Optionally for given window show the Statement Number or the SIt of each statementwith an option for showing them at either the right or at the left margin Independently the showing of statement names may be turned on or off 7c6 Frozen Statements worker may select number of statements in random order and designate them as frozen One of the viewspecification options is to have the frozen statements appear at the top of the frame with the rest of that window left for normal viewing and editing The frozen statements may be edited or even crossedited between any other displayed or addressable statements 7c7 UserSpecified Content Filters simple content analysis language may be used in Set Content Pattern command which compiles little content checking program One of the viewspecification options will cause the system to display only those statements which satisfy both the structure and level conditions imposed by other viewspecs and 7c which also pass the contentanalysis test applied by this program Where desired very sophis ticated contentanalysis programs may be written using fullblown programming language and placed on call for any user 7c8 USERSPECIFIED SEQUENCE GENERATORS 7d In the foregoing view is created by beginning at designated locati on in document file and selecting certain of the the following statements 7c3 DCE 9Dec83 1743PST 225 Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT for display according to the viewing parameters possibly suppressing statements that dont pass the test of contentanalysis program This is es sentially parameterized sequence generator and provides very useful options for selectively viewing statements within document however it works only by selectively discarding statements from sequence provided in standard order Application programmers can provide alternate se quencegenerator programs which any user can in yoke in straightforward manner In such case the apparent structure being presented to the user could be generated from sequence of candidate statements according to any rules one may invent and the actual views could be further controlled by the abovedescribed viewspecs for level clipping truncation content filtering etc Perhaps the most commonly used special sequence generator is one that provides an Include feature where specially tagged links embedded in the text will cause their cited passages to be included in place of the includeLink statements as though they were part of this file This provision enables arbitrary assemblage of text and formatting direc tives from wide collection of files to represent virtual onedocument super file For instance the whole assemblage could be passed to the formatter by means of single user action to generate com posite phototypeset document 7d3 TRAVELING THROUGH THE WORKING FILES An important provision in AUGMENT enables an author to freely travel around in his online file space to reach particular view point of his choiceie the position within file from which the system develops the desired form of view according to the currently invoked view specifications Traveling from one view point to another is accom plished by Jump commands of which the simplest perhaps is direct Jump to statement designated by screen selection Then for worker grown used to employing address strings next form would be Jump on an embedded link or to statement des ignated by typedin address stringusing any combination of the addressing elements and viewspecs described above For example the link 4bmI points to the Statement 4b while invok ing viewspecs and which cause the state ments SIDs to be displayed The link Ref ili points to the document referenced by the link in the statement named Refi invok ing viewspec for user content filtering and sets the filter to LL to show only those statements be ginning with lowercase letter The applications are effectively endless 1h MODIFYING THE DOCUMENT STRUCTURES Given the array of capabilities described above it is very simple also to provide for very flexible ma nipulation of the file structure For operating on small basic set of structureentity nouns essen tially the same basic verbs may be used as for text manipulationie insert Delete Move Copy Re place and Transpose are quite sufficient for most cases For instance Move Branch 2b to follow 3c 7d2 immediately moves Statement 2b and all of its sub statements to follow Statement an their statement numbers are automatically changed from 2b 2bi etc to 3d 3di etc few extra verbs are useful for structure manipula tion For instance Break command will break given statement off at designated point in its text string and establish the rest of the text as new separate statement And an Append command does the reverseie it appends the text of one or more existing statements to the end of designated statement 9b major source of structuremodification capability derives from the associated studying capabili ties For example if an author can view file document with specifications that show him only one line each of just those statements in the top two levels he gets an overview of the highlevel or ganization that helps immensely to study his cur rent structure or outline 9c Concurrent use of mouse and keyset also provide con siderable gains in speed and flexibility for studying and modifying document structure For example if when studying the overview described in the pre vious paragraph the author perceives that State ment 2b really belongs in Section following State ment 3c he can execute the necessary move com mand in very quick deft manner Keyset hand strikes and for Move Branch while the mouse hand is positioning the cursor anywhere in the text line of Statement 2b chord strokes 8b 8a Authorship Pro visions in AUGMENT DCE 9Dec83 1743PST QAD2250 The mouse hand depresses the Select button on the mouse while the cursor is on Statement 2b then moves to Statement 3c and depresses it again and then depresses it again to say OK do it button pushes synchronized with the mouse move ment as it made two selections on easy window wide wholeline targets Note just had myself timed for this above opera tionan unhurried 25 seconds In our view interactive computer support offers an author priceless opportunity to get away from the geometric bondage inflicted by pages margins and linesthings which have very little if any bearing upon the content and organization of ones text In terms of value to the authoring process we differ sharply from those who advocate What you see is what you get working mode during the development of documents content and organiza tion For this kind of work experienced users of the foregoing kind of flexible facility for addressing viewing and manipulating structured documents would consider What you see mode as rela tive handicap SUPPORTING MULTIPARTY COLLABORATION 10 The support that advanced technology can provide for close collaboration among knowledge workers is very important and much underrated possibility For multipleauthor activities collaborative sup port is an important aspect of system capability Some years ago we introduced the following pro visions into AUGMENT more complete over view treatment of these is given in Ref8 Electronic Mall Its primary attributes of speed automatic distribution and computertocomputer directness are well recognizedand are generally accepted now as important to the effectiveness of knowledge workers AUGMENT Mail has features that are beyond what most electronic mail systems offer and which provide unique benefit to the authorship process AUGMENTs mail system allows one to send com plete structured documents as well as small mes sages in an authorship environment an important role for electronic mail is for the control and dis tribution of documentswhere small throwaway messages are considered to be but special class of document An author should be able to bundle up any combination of text and graphics in the forms that he has been using for studying and manipulat ing themand send the bundle to other workers in AUGMENT such bundle is just llke any other file structure and can be studied and manipulated in corporated into other files documents saved or 12 deleted Recorded MallA Sh Journal System When mailing document an AUGMENT worker may optionally specify that it be installed as recorded item in this case before distributing the item the system will make permanent record if it as file in specified Journal collection And just as though it had been published this recorded Journal item cannot later be changed The system assigns straightforward accession identifier simple number and any authorized worker is henceforth guaranteed access to that Journal item by specifying the name of the Journalcollection and the Journalitem numbereg as specified in the link OAD2237 given journal may be set up to serve multiple hosts and is much like special library It has its collection of documents and AUGMENT provides associated support processes for entry cataloging retrieval and access Together with the linking capability described above Journal system provides an extremely ef fective form of recorded dialog Crossreference links between succession of Journal items produces an interlinked network of collaborative contribu tions plans outlines document drafts schedules short comments detailed critiques reference mate rial etc The online worker can follow these links very easily and using multiple windows and flexi ble viewing options can make very effective use of such records For instance consider detailed commentary di rected toward preliminary design document recorded in given Journal collection The author writing the commentary could view the design document in one window and his developing com mentary document in another He can easily estab lish links in his commentary to cite any passage in the design documenteg statement term in the statement or diagram Then this author would submit his commentary into the Journal per haps specifying list of colleagues for distribu tion Each listed user would automatically receive mail item announcing this new Journal entry DCE 9Dec83 1743PST OAD2250 Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT giving subject author date etc and the all important link to the new Journal file containing the commentary Any such recipient can subse quently study both the commentary and its cited planning document in similar multiwindow linkassisted manner Furthermore this second reader could develop and submit his own recorded commentary which be cause of the citation power of AUGMENT links could be as short and to the point as Frankly John think your comment in DDDxxxaa is mistake Didnt you notice the earlier assumption in DDDxxxbb Maybe you should go back to Toms earlier requirements documentespecially at Here DDD and EEE represent Journal names xxx and zzz represent Journal item numbers and aa bb and cc rep resent addresses pointing to specific passages in those Journal files In official parlance retrieval is the finding out about the existence of relevant piece of informa tion whereas access is the subsequent process of gaining possession of the information For users of AUGMENTs Journal system retrieval is immense ly facilitated by the widespread use of citation links When one can follow them as easily as can practiced AUGMENT worker these links provide extremely effective retrieval support We have supplemented this with some simple automati cally generated catalog files which made rather nice balance Access is provided by direct Jump on reference link if the file is on line if it isnt AUG MENT asks the worker if she wants it retrieved and simple affirmative response automatically launches request for the system operator to retrieve the file from its archive tape after which the worker is notified of its availability via elec tronic mail private document can be submitted into Journal In this case only those workers listed at Journal entry time can get access to the central copy Such private item would not be listed or indexed in the public catalogs We have used the Journal system very heavily since 1970 to support AUGMENTs development activity many customers have employed it heavily since 1975 There are about 100000 entries recorded in the original Journal now dont know about other newer AUGMENT Journal collections We found that as workers became at home in this environment they were increasingly free about sub mitting their items to the public It became evi dent that the scientific tradition of active and open interchange has some solid relevance to the col laborative processes in our smaller colleague com munities Time and again worker would come across others dialog and be able to contribute some valuable information sometimes onesentence comment with critical citation link Often the payoff went the other way the new party found immediate value in an old piece of recorded dialog SharedScreen Teleconferencing Consider case where two people sit down to work together at terminal where they can both see the screens and where either one can take over the controls This is being done countless times every day throughout the country in different combinations of expertexpert expertnovice novicecoach etc When talking together on their telephones two or more distantly separated AUGMENT users can collaborate in manner very similar to this Suppose that two workers Smith and Jones want to set up and operate in SharedScreen Conferencing mode Smith is in Princeton working on host Office and Jones is in San Francisco working on host Of andh both of these host computers are con nected to the same network Assumedly they are in telephone contact when they decide to work in this sharedscreen mode to collaborate on Smiths cur rent job Jones will enter the command Share display with user SMITH On host 0F12 Viewing other display Smith will enter the command Share display with user JONES On host 0F4 Showing this display To give these commands each person only entered the characters shown in upper case entry case ac tually irrelevant plus the digits plus an OK cQ Key action where each exclamation point is shown Whatever tool that Jones is currently using will continue responding to his controlling actions as evidenced by various feedback and portrayal ac tions in the windows on his screen Smiths screen image will clear and be replaced with replica of Jones screen imagemultiple windows and all For 10 Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT DCE 9Dec83 43 QAD2250 the duration of the sharedscreen session Smiths screen image will continue to replicate what is shown on Jones screen There are provisions for passing control back and forth between workers For instance Jones can pass control to Smith so that Smith can show him some material or method of work There are also provi sions for the subsequent entry and departure of other conference participants EMBEDDING THE GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS For complete support of document development it is important to provide integrated means for develop ing viewing and manipulating graphical portray als These portrayals should be part of the working files from the very start to be studied passed about in mail shared in Conferencing mode edited cap tioned labelled and moved about within the docu ment structure Furthermore active relevant cita lion links pointing to these graphical constructs would be installed in and followed from textual passages throughout the associated set of docu ments including Mail and Journal documents AUGMENTs architecture and file structure were designed for this end and good bit of the associ ated implementation is in place graphical data structure can be attached to any given file node and there are basic capabilities for composing studying and modifying graphical diagrams When formatting for suitably equipped phototypesetting device there are formatting di rectives to designate the position and scale for placing these diagrams on page An AUGMENT file with integrated text and graphics can thus be mapped automatically onto highquality docu ment whose pages contain both text and line drawings Our goal here was for what we call an illustrative graphics capabilitybasic to which is command that when directed toward any conventional plotter file will translate it into diagram at tached to designated node In this way we can make use of graphic constructs developed within almost any applications system most of which have provision for outputting conventional plot ter files The most important next step is to adapt bit mapped display as an AUGMENT workstation so the integrated text and graphics can be viewed and manipulated on the same screen Heretofore to do graphic work an author has had to attach Tek tronix 4014 storagetube display to the special printergraphic port of her AUGMENT worksta tion This has made use of AUGMENT graphics slow and expensive enough to limit the number of user groups who have developed the integrated use of mixed text and graphics CONCLUSION lie 12 AUGMENTs unique provisions stemmed for the most part from the conceptual framework within which AUGMENT was developed For instance consider the pervasive and significant changes in the environment in which humans will be doing their knowledge work Note that the habits methods conventions intuitions etc that comprise the ways in which we think work and collabo rate are for the most part products of many centu ries of cultural evolutionin radically different environment With radically different environ ment this constant process of cultural evolution can be expected to take some radical turns The AUGMENT developmental framework as sumed that many of these ways are candidates lb now for change in directions that heretofore would not have been beneficial The AUGMENT system emerged as first step in considering few such changes which perhaps can improve human capa bility for doing knowledge work because their new ways will enable us more effectively to harness the new tools toward more effective basic capabil ity This is very different from trying to auto mate our old ways of doing things As an example consider the What You See Is What You Get WYSIWYG syndrome It is Ic highly touted feature for many vendors It provides definite advantage for the final process of con verting computerheld document to nicely for matted hard copy But what does it do for author ship Well in our framework it has negative impact We were happy to abandon those con straints of lines and pages and other formatting ge ometry which did not contribute to matters of con tent and structure We have chosen instead to provide the authorship process with structured lid files flexible addressing flexible windowsize viewing level and truncation viewspecs etc things that would be awkward or impossible to provide in 1WYG environment This DCE 9Dec83 1743PST OAD2250 Authorship Provisions in AUGMENT 11 provides the authorship phase with flexibility and power for studying and manipulating content and structure that we wouldnt consider trading off for WYS1WYG Save it for the production phase 12c Here is another bit of culture that deserves reex amination Consider the dictum Easy to learn and natural to use Or User friendly The question is for whom are you judging that things will be easy or natural or friendly For designers of craftwork tool systems very different perceptions of this issue are warranted between system for the occasional weekend doityourself person and system to be heavily used day after day by professionals The AUGMENT User Interface System enables us easily to configure either kind of tool collection This paper describes part of what is provided to professional knowledge workers who do signifi cant amount of authorship work We observe no more difficulty in their learning how to employ this relatively large collection of tools than one would expect for professional woodworkers in their learning about the relatively large collection of chisels and other tools of their trade 12e It is basic part of our framework that to augment human knowledge workers attention must be given not only to tools but to methods and skills as well Because of space limitations the scope of this pa per was restricted to summary of those tool pro visions within AUGMENT that especially facili tate the authorship process full description of How to use AUGMENT to would definitely need to include methods of work that effectively harness these tool provisions and the special kinds of skills that yield unique payoff in executing these methods This is true for every tool system of course but it seems especially true in this case because many AUGMENT provisions do not fit into the general cultural background of our authorship process 10 Perhaps the best way for very brief summarization of what AUGMENTs users feel about its unique features is simply to say that those who leave its working environment really miss them REFERENCES 13 Refi Toward Integrated Evolutionary Office Automation Systems
