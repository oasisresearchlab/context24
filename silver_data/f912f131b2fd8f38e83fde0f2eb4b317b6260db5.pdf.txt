Methods : The electronic health records of 165 , 320 patients with COVID - 19 from January 1 , 2020 , to August 27 , 2021 , were analyzed . Data on age , race , sex , smoking status ( never , current , former ) , and basic disease were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models . Results : In total , 6 , 133 patients ( 3 . 7 % ) were reinfected . The overall reinfection rate for never , current , and former smokers was 4 . 2 , 3 . 5 , and 5 . 7 % , respectively . Although the risk of reinfection was highest among former smokers aged ≥ 65 years ( 7 . 7 % [ 422 / 5 , 460 ] ) , the reinfection rate among current smokers aged ≥ 65 years was 6 . 2 % ( 341 / 5 , 543 ) . Among reinfected patients , the number of basic diseases was higher in former smokers ( 2 . 41 ± 1 . 16 ) than in current ( 2 . 28 ± 1 . 07 , P = 0 . 07 ) and never smokers ( 2 . 07 ± 1 . 05 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Former smokers who are older may have been exposed to factors that increase their risk of symptomatic COVID - 19 reinfection . KEYWORDS COVID - 19 , smoking , reinfection , data analysis , database , United States FrontiersinPublicHealth 01 frontiersin . org Ando et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 985494 Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) continues to spread , with severe cases occurring worldwide . Chronic diseases , such as hypertension , diabetes , and obesity , are risk factors for severe COVID - 19 ( 1 , 2 ) . It was important to understand these risks earlier when COVID - 19 was identiﬁed ; however , they were not fully elucidated . With the widespread availability of vaccines , the risk of reinfection has been reported to be ∼ 1 % or less ( 3 ) . A recent meta - analysis showed a lower reinfection rate among vaccinated individuals than among unvaccinated individuals ( 0 . 32 vs . 0 . 74 % ) . However , the rate varied depending on the time of the epidemic , increasing to 3 . 31 % during the Omicron epidemic ( 4 ) . Factors that reduce the risk of reinfection include vaccines and a history of COVID - 19 , which greatly reduces the risk of reinfection ( 5 ) . Additionally , the low likelihood of reinfection after infection is presumed to be equivalent to increased protection against infection by vaccination ( 6 ) . However , the data on reinfection exclude eﬀects related to smoking status . This information regularly varies as the period of the COVID - 19 epidemic lengthens . Although the vaccine is eﬀective in older people ( 7 ) , it is important to anticipate the risks associated with reinfection ( 8 ) . There have been indications that reinfection may occur even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies . The eﬀects and protective factors associated with reinfection and basic diseases are not fully understood ( 9 , 10 ) . Flacco et al . ( 11 ) reported an increased risk of reinfection when risk factors include at least one of the following : diabetes , hypertension , major cardiovascular disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , kidney disease , and cancer . In contrast , smoking has been considered a risk factor since the beginning of the COVID - 19 epidemic ( 12 ) ; however , there are conﬂicting reports on its impact on severe disease and reinfection . For example , de Lusignan et al . ( 13 ) reported that the positivity rate for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is higher in adult males and Black individuals . Simultaneously , smokers are less likely to test positive . Similarly , there are conﬂicting reports regarding reduced and worsening risk ( 14 , 15 ) . The eﬀect of smoking on COVID - 19 has been associated with increased mortality and disease severity . However , the causal relationship is yet to be determined , although the risk of infection appears to have reduced in current smokers compared with that in never smokers , and the risk of severity and death appears to have increased in former smokers ( 16 ) . Interestingly , a Abbreviations : CI , Conﬁdence interval ; COPD , Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; EHR , Electronic health records ; HR , Hazard ratios ; HT , Hypertension ; IP , Interstitial pneumonia ; IQR , Interquartile range ; SD , Standard deviation . higher degree of COVID - 19 progression has been reported in smokers , particularly in younger smokers under the age of 45 ( 17 ) . However , the risk of reinfection is yet to be evaluated . Therefore , using a large database , we aimed to examine the relationship between basic disease and patient background , including smoking status , with reinfection . Methods Study design and data source The electronic health records ( EHRs ) used in this study were provided by the Healthjump database ( Healthjump Inc . , Philadelphia , PA , USA ) and the COVID - 19 Research Database Consortium ( https : / / covid19researchdatabase . org ) . All personal information in this database is anonymized . Participants and deﬁnitions The Healthjump database receives and anonymizes the origin of the EHR data of over 40 million unique patients and several healthcare organizations across the United States ( 18 ) . EHR data from January 1 , 2020 , to August 27 , 2021 , were analyzed . Patients with SARS - CoV - 2 RNA positivity ( International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems , Tenth Revision ; ICD - 10 : U07 . 1 ) aged ≥ 20 years were included . The patient exclusion criteria were as follows : those with missing information regarding age , sex , and diagnosis date of COVID - 19 ; suspected SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ( ICD - 10 : U07 . 2 ) ; type 1 diabetes ; and body mass index ( BMI ) ≤ 15 kg / m 2 or > 50 kg / m 2 . Data obtained included age ; sex ; racial identity , including ethnicity ( Hispanic or non - Hispanic white , non - Hispanic Black , Asian , and others or unknown ) ; 1 - year medication history of asthma ; COPD before SARS - CoV - 2 diagnosis ; diagnosis of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) ( ICD - 10 : E11 . 65 , E11 . 8 , E11 . 9 ) ; hypertension ( ICD - 10 : I10 ) ; hyperlipidemia ( ICD - 10 : I78 ) ; cardiovascular disease , including angina pectoris , myocardial infarction , and other acute ischemic heart diseases ( ICD - 10 : I20 - I25 ) ; chronic asthma ( ICD - 10 : J45 ) ; COPD ( ICD - 10 : J44 . 9 ) ; interstitial pneumonia ( IP ) ( ICD - 10 : J84 ) ; and BMI , measured by hospital staﬀ or self - reported up to 6 months before the analysis . When more than one value was available for analysis , the value obtained closest to the diagnosis of COVID - 19 was considered . The Current Procedural Terminology 4th edition and the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes were used for vaccination history . Patients with a code for vaccination services ( Pﬁzer , 91300 ; Moderna , 91301 ; Johnson & Johnson , 91303 ) were deﬁned as having received the vaccination , and patients without the code were deﬁned as “not vaccinated” or FrontiersinPublicHealth 02 frontiersin . org Ando et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 985494 “no vaccination history registered . ” In addition , vaccination was deﬁned as complete if a second code was present 18 days later . If the diagnosis code of COVID - 19 reappeared 90 days after the disappearance , it was deﬁned as reinfection . Since reinfection is only identiﬁed by codes , reinfection was treated as symptomatic reinfection in this study . Therefore , data on reinfections that were not diagnosed and were asymptomatic were excluded . Reinfection was considered the study outcome , while T2D , obesity , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , asthma , COPD , IP , and lung cancer history were evaluated . The number of days from the date of the ﬁrst diagnosis to reinfection was calculated and used in a Cox proportional hazards model . When reinfection was not conﬁrmed , the number of days between the initial infection and the end of the observation period of this study was used . Patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg / m 2 were classiﬁed as obese ( 19 ) . Smoking was deﬁned as occasional light to heavy smoking . Those using e - cigarettes and vapor cigarettes and those chewing tobacco were excluded . Smoking status was deﬁned as current , former ( history of smoking in the past ) , never , and unknown ( without any information ) . The relationship between smoking status and the number of basic diseases that signiﬁcantly aﬀected reinfection was examined . Statistical analysis Patient data that followed a normal distribution ( age and BMI ) are expressed as mean ± standard deviation values . The observation period is expressed as median values ( interquarter range ) ; continuous variables were analyzed using a one - tailed unpaired t - test . Categorical variables were analyzed using the χ 2 test and are expressed as absolute numbers and / or percentages . For the analysis of reinfection and smoking status of the three groups , the Yates - corrected χ 2 test was performed in each of the two groups , followed by a Bonferroni correction ( indicated P - value was tripled ) . Following analysis of variance , the Tukey – Kramer test was used to compare continuous variables among the three groups . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) for reinfection risk were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for sex , age ( ≥ 65 years ) , BMI ( ≤ 30 kg / m 2 ) , history of T2D ( yes / no ) , hypertension ( yes / no ) , hyperlipidemia ( yes / no ) , cardiovascular disease ( yes / no ) , asthma ( yes / no ) , COPD ( yes / no ) , IP ( yes / no ) , lung cancer ( yes / no ) , and smoking status ( never , current , and former ) . In addition , the Cox proportional hazards assumption was tested . All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16 . 0 , Statistics for Windows ( Stata Corp LLC , College Status , TX , USA ) , and a P - value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Ethical considerations This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Kitasato University Hospital ( No . 20 - 366 ) . Since unlinked , anonymized data were used , the ethics committee conﬁrmed that this study was not subject to compliance with the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects , and the requirement for informed consent was waived . Results The mean age of the 165 , 320 ( 72 , 994 ; 44 . 2 % males ) patients with COVID - 19 was 51 . 0 ± 17 . 6 years . The number of reinfected patients was 6 , 133 ( 3 . 7 % ; mean age 51 . 0 ± 17 . 6 years ) . The median observation period was 242 ( 184 – 316 ) days for patients with only initial infection and 167 ( 122 – 230 ) days for those with reinfection . The interracial data and BMI are presented in Table 1 . The number of initial and reinfected cases by region is shown in Supplementary Table S1 . The number of infected patients peaked in December 2020 and January 2021 with 27 , 423 and 27 , 039 patients , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . Reinfections occurred around July 2020 , with a reinfection rate of 0 . 36 % in August 2020 ( after 8 months of observation ) , which increased to 3 . 85 % in August 2021 . The reinfection rate was slightly lower among vaccinated patients who received two doses than those who received only one dose , although the data supporting these ﬁndings are limited ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Patients with IP had the highest risk of reinfection , followed by those with asthma and hyperlipidemia , with signiﬁcantly higher HR ( Figure 2A ) . The risk was also signiﬁcantly higher in patients aged > 65 years ; women ; and those with a history of hypertension , cardiovascular disease , and COPD . In contrast , obesity , T2D , and lung cancer showed no association . Regarding smoking status , current smokers had a signiﬁcantly lower risk of reinfection than never smokers ( HR 0 . 82 [ 0 . 76 – 0 . 88 ] ; P < 0 . 001 ) , while former smokers had an HR of 1 . 23 ( 1 . 13 – 1 . 33 ) , P < 0 . 001 ( Figure 2B ) . The overall reinfection rates by smoking status were 4 . 2 % ( 1 , 664 / 40 , 049 ) , 3 . 5 % ( 1 , 251 / 35 , 612 ) , and 5 . 7 % ( 926 / 16 , 105 ) among never , current , and former smokers , respectively . The risk of reinfection was highest in former smokers aged ≥ 65 years : 7 . 7 % ( 422 / 5 , 460 ) ( Figure 3A ) . Current smokers aged ≥ 65 years had a reinfection rate of 6 . 2 % ( 341 / 5 , 543 ) . Regardless of the smoking status , the reinfection rate was higher among patients aged ≥ 65 years than among those younger . For patients aged < 65 years , the number of basic diseases associated with the risk of reinfection was < 1 in patients with an initial infection but tended to be slightly higher among patients with reinfection . The number of basic diseases was signiﬁcantly higher at the initial infection among patients aged < 65 years FrontiersinPublicHealth 03 frontiersin . org Ando et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 985494 TABLE 1 Characteristics of patients with COVID - 19 during initial infection and reinfection .

Discussion This study showed that the risk of reinfection was higher among patients aged > 65 years , and the highest rate of reinfection was observed among former smokers . Furthermore , former smokers who were older had a higher number of basic diseases , such as a higher risk of reinfection , than non - smokers and current smokers . The results suggest that former smokers were at potential risk of reinfection and that smoking cessation among older people was a sign of susceptibility to COVID - 19 reinfection . In addition , this study reconﬁrmed that it is necessary to be cautious about reinfection if patients have many basic diseases . This study found that smoking aﬀects the rate of symptomatic reinfections ; however , results for non - symptomatic reinfections excluded from the database are unavailable . Therefore , this study’s results do not represent the impact of smoking on all reinfections . The data were not obtained during the outbreak of the Omicron variant ; however , the analysis provides important suggestions for future infectious disease control and prevention measures . In a meta - analysis on smoking and COVID - 19 , the summary relative risk of death was 1 . 29 ( 95 % CI 1 . 03 – 1 . 62 ) for current smokers and 1 . 25 ( 95 % CI 1 . 11 – 1 . 42 ) for former smokers compared with never smokers . Although the risk of mortality increased for those who smoke or have smoked , no signiﬁcant diﬀerence is observed in the risk of death across smoking status ( 20 ) . Other meta - analyses have shown that the risk of severe disease is higher in patients with a smoking history ( 21 ) . Current smokers who were older had a 2 - fold increase in the reinfection ratio compared with those aged < 65 years ( 3 vs . 6 % ) in this study . This increased ratio was slightly higher than that of former and never smokers . The highest rate of reinfection was observed among former smokers who also had a higher number of basic diseases , which may have increased the risk of reinfection ; this indicates that tobacco cessation does not directly increase the risk of reinfection . A meta - analysis by Patanavanich et al . found that smoking increases the risk of COVID - 19 . In the ﬁndings on smoking and COVID - 19 , a meta - analysis of a total of 11 , 590 patients on smoking and COVID - 19 in the early 2020 pandemic concluded that smoking is a risk factor for COVID - 19 progression , with smokers having higher odds of COVID - 19 progression than non - smokers ( OR 1 . 91 , 95 % CI 1 . 42 – 2 . 59 , P = 0 . 001 ) ( 22 ) . However , other studies have shown that it lowers this risk . The complex issues of regional , national , and racial diﬀerences make it diﬃcult to provide a deﬁnitive answer . The smoking rate among the patients with SARS - CoV - 2 - positive in this study was 39 . 0 % , which is higher than the smoking rate of 7 – 13 % in the United States ( 23 ) . Therefore , as in this study , the initial infection may have been inﬂuenced by smoking , or it may have occurred in older patients who smoke . Angiotensin - converting enzyme - 2 expression in the lungs increases in smokers and patients with COPD ( 24 ) . Smoking can also aﬀect the macrophage and cytokine responses and the body’s ability to control infection . It has been suggested that smoking may aﬀect interleukin 6 levels and inﬂuence inﬂammation and viral disease severity FrontiersinPublicHealth 06 frontiersin . org Ando et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 985494 ( 25 ) . Smoking is a risk factor for the acute and chronic severity of chikungunya virus infection ( 26 ) . Similarly , the risk of infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae , Legionella , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae is 3 – 5 times higher among smokers ( 27 ) . Therefore , it may aﬀect the symptoms and severity of COVID - 19 reinfection . It is unclear whether all reinfections , including symptomatic and non - symptomatic , are aﬀected ; however , symptomatic reinfections may be aﬀected . Moreover , cigarette and e - cigarette users have increased adherence and colony formation of Streptococcus pneumoniae because of the upregulation of its receptor molecule ( 27 ) . Nicotine may promote the cellular uptake mechanism of SARS - CoV - 2 by nicotine - containing α 7 - nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling ( 28 ) . The concomitant use of tobacco and e - cigarettes also increases the risk of being positive ( 29 ) . The diﬀerence between the mechanism in current and former smokers is unknown ; nevertheless , our results suggest that underlying disease and age play a role . It is also possible that the COVID - 19 pandemic may have increased the number of smokers who were concerned or fearful of the eﬀects of smoking ( 30 ) . In addition , there have been behavioral changes regarding attempts to quit smoking ( 31 ) , which may have increased the number of former smokers . Unfortunately , the results of this study suggest that quitting smoking does not immediately lead to a lower risk of reinfection . Therefore , the increased risk among patients who quit smoking could be because the number of underlying diseases , such as hypertension and diabetes , was higher in the former smoking group than in the non - smoking group , making it seem as if smoking cessation increased the risk of reinfection . The percentage of reinfected patients was 3 . 7 % in this study ; we had diﬃculty interpreting the reinfection data . Our reported reinfection rate was < 1 % ( 32 – 34 ) , and the mortality rate due to reinfection is considered low ( 35 ) . The initial reinfection rate was low in this study , and the rate of reinfection in the initial 8 months was 0 . 36 % , which was not diﬀerent from that reported in other studies . This could have been because of the early stage of the epidemic and the short observation period . Subsequently , the number of reinfected patients increased sharply around the second quarter of 2021 . Slezak et al . reported that more patients were hospitalized for suspected reinfection ( 36 / 315 , 11 . 4 % ) than for initial infection ( 4 , 094 / 75 , 149 ; 5 . 4 % ) ( 36 ) . It can be observed that the number of patients who were reinfected increased with a prolonged observation period . After July 2021 , the delta variant predominated , and the risk of reinfection may have been higher than that reported previously ( 37 ) . Furthermore , the timing of this event coincided with an increase in the number of reinfection cases in our study . Reinfection occurs 6 – 9 months after the initial infection . However , it has been reported that reinfection was not observed at 12 months or later ( 11 ) , and the decrease in anti - SARS - CoV - 2 S - RBD IgG antibody in the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was approximately one - tenth of that at 6 months ( 38 ) . The humoral and cellular immune responses are quantitatively lower , and the duration of protection is shorter in older people who commonly need nursing care than in healthy people . In this study , old age was the most relevant factor for reinfection . As for the persistence of antigens and RNA , the clearance of the virus is reduced in older people ( over 65 years of age ) ( 39 ) , which may indirectly contribute to the risk of severe disease due to prolonged hospitalization and worsening of other basic diseases , making the occurrence of reinfection easier . In addition , antibody titers decrease in older people ; however , the neutralizing antibody titers rise again with reinfection ( 10 ) . In contrast , antibodies in healthcare workers have been reported to drop by only approximately half in 6 months ( 40 ) . However , the minor decrease in antibody titers may be related to the maintenance of antibody titers , as reports of non - clinical cases were excluded ( 41 ) . Healthcare workers have a lower risk of reinfection due to the maintenance of antibody titers ( 42 ) . The reduced risk of reinfection with vaccination is the most important confounding factor in this study . During the observation period of this study , vaccination coverage in the United States adult population was ∼ 70 % for the entire population , with more than 99 % coverage achieved in those older than 65 years ( 43 ) . However , it has been reported that unvaccinated individuals are 2 . 34 times more likely to be reinfected than vaccinated individuals ( 44 ) . Finally , the results of this study do not indicate that smoking lowers the risk of reinfection . Rather , the fact that one quits smoking due to a health condition that worsens may be used as a warning to increase the risk of reinfection . This study had some limitations . First , the reinfection rate in this study was calculated based on a limited cohort ; therefore , it should be interpreted with caution . Second , since only reinfection with the diagnosis was analyzed in this study , non - symptomatic reinfection that was not registered in the database was excluded . Third , investigating the impact of vaccination was necessary to improve the accuracy of the data , but the missing information hindered the identiﬁcation of consciously unvaccinated individuals . However , the sample size was small . Fourth , vaccination was performed rapidly at venues and pharmacies , making it diﬃcult to link the information in this database . Fifth , there were no data regarding the neutralizing antibody titers in the reinfected patients . Therefore , further research is needed to determine whether the presence of basic diseases directly aﬀects the amount and half - life of neutralizing antibodies . Finally , we examined the relationship between the number of basic diseases , smoking status , and age with reinfection ; however , the results did not reﬂect the weighting of each basic disease or the actual respiratory function of the patient . In conclusion , former smokers who were older may have been exposed to factors that increase the potential risk of COVID - 19 reinfection .
