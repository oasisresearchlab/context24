LETTERS Population context determines cell - to - cell variability in endocytosis and virus infection Berend Snijder 1 , 2 , Raphael Sacher 1 , 2 , Pauli Ra¨mo¨ 1 , Eva - Maria Damm 1 , Prisca Liberali 1 & Lucas Pelkmans 1 Single - cellheterogeneityincell populations arisesfrom acombina - tion of intrinsic and extrinsic factors 1 – 3 . This heterogeneity has been measured for gene transcription , phosphorylation , cell mor - phology and drug perturbations , and used to explain various aspects of cellular physiology 4 – 6 . In all cases , however , the causes of heterogeneity were not studied . Here we analyse , for the first time , the heterogeneous patterns of related cellular activities , namely virus infection , endocytosis and membrane lipid composi - tion in adherent human cells . We reveal correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the population context of a cell , and we derive probabilistic models that can explain and predict most cellular heterogeneity of these activities , solely on the basis of each cell’s population context . We find that accounting for population - determined heterogeneity is essential for interpret - ing differences between the activity levels of cell populations . Finally , werevealthatsynergybetweentwomolecularcomponents , focal adhesion kinase and the sphingolipid GM1 , enhances the population - determinedpatternofsimianvirus40 ( SV40 ) infection . Ourfindings provide an explanation for theoriginofheterogeneity patterns of cellular activities in adherent cell populations . Virus infection can be considered the end result of the concerted action of many cellular processes , including endocytosis and the establishment of membrane lipid composition 7 , 8 . It is well accepted that these activities display heterogeneity within a population of cells , but the underlying causes of this heterogeneity are not known . We can therefore not predict how such activities behave in a population of cells 9 . To study the heterogeneity of these activities , we examined large populations of single monoclonal adherent human cells after three days of growth . These were infected by rotavirus , dengue virus , mouse hepatitis virus ( MHV ) or SV40 . MHV uses clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( CME ) for infectious entry into the cell 10 , and SV40 binds to the sphingolipid GM1 for host cell attachment and entry 11 , 12 . To ana - lyse CME , we allowed cells to internalize fluorescent transferrin 13 . To determine the amount of GM1 , which is enriched in lipid rafts on the cell surface 14 , we exposed cells to fluorescent cholera toxin B 15 . We observed that the cell - to - cell variation or heterogeneity of these activities displays specific patterns in both cancer - ( HeLa and A431 ) ( Fig . 1A ) and non - cancer - derived ( MCF10A ) cells ( see below ) . The patterns could not have been the result of physical constraints on the accessibility of virus particles or fluorescent probes to particular cells , because different types of pattern were observed . A potential source of single - cell heterogeneity is the deterministic interplay between the phenotypic state of a cell and its activities 2 , 16 , mediated by sensors and signal transduction networks . Growing iso - genic adherent mammalian cells create cell islets and regions that are sparsely or densely populated , to which cells adapt their size , shape and rate of proliferation 17 , 18 ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) , and display several discrete subpopulations 19 . Together , this implies that patterns of varying cellular states can arise from the adaptation of individual human cells to the particular ‘population context’ in which they reside . The coupling between cell size andtiming of meiosis in yeast 20 , between cell size and the determination of phage infection outcome in Escherichia coli 21 , and the self - assembly of prokaryotic cells into complex colony patterns 22 , indicate that such mechanisms also operate in unicellular organisms . We therefore hypothesized that the heterogeneity patterns that we observed are caused by regulatory mechanisms that couple the phenotypic state of a cell to intracellular processes on which virus infection depends , such as endocytosis and the lipid composition of the cell surface . To reveal the presence of such mechanisms , we used three data - driven modelling approaches on several single - cell measurements obtained by computerized image analysis and supervised machine learning from multiple large populations of cells . ( See Fig . 1B for an overview of the methods used , and Supplementary Methods for detailed information . ) We first measured for each cell the size of the population to which it belonged , its local cell density , its position on a cell islet edge , its cell size , its mitotic state and its apoptotic state ( microenvironment and cell state ) . By delineating how these para - meters interact with each other , we quantified how the characteristics of a cell population are determined . This showed that each para - meter , in particular population size , local cell density , position on a cell islet edge , and cell size , represents a population - determined property of an individual cell . The same interactions were observed in cancer cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , normal diploid cells ( see below ) and primary cells ( not shown ) , despite their different morphologies and growth rates . For each cell , we next determined whether it was infected , or we quantified its CME activity or cell - surface level of GM1 ( cellular activities ) . We then used the population - determined properties as predictors to model the probability of infection , the activity of CME and the amount of GM1 on the cell surface . In each instance , models could be derived that had good fits ( Fig . 1C and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The model parameters demonstrated the existence of exten - sive and specific regulatory mechanisms between population context and virus infection , endocytosis and membrane lipid composition ( Fig . 1D ) . Importantly , the models were able to predict accurately the heterogeneity patterns of cellular activities , solely based on a quanti - tative assessment of the population context and the state of indi - vidual cells ( Fig . 1E ) . Aninterestingquestionthatarisesistowhatextentthesepopulation - determined effects contribute to the total variation observed in a population . Strikingly , variance analysis ( Supplementary Methods ) demonstrated that variation determined by population context is a major component of the total variation observed . For rotavirus , SV40 and dengue virus infection , our measures of the local environment 1 Institute of Molecular Systems Biology , ETH Zurich ( Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ) , Wolfgang Pauli - Strasse 16 , CH - 8093 Zurich , Switzerland . 2 Zurich PhD Program in Molecular Life Sciences , Zurich , Switzerland .

All rights reserved ©2009 and cellular state account for at least 60 % , 74 % and 82 % of the respective total variation for each activity ( Fig . 2a ) . For CME and GM1 content on the cell surface , variation determined by population context appeared to constitute at least 30 % and 21 % of the respective total variation ( Fig . 2a ) . To understand better the variation unexplained by population context , we analysed the variance in CME activity in groups of cells with similar population - determined phenotypic properties . This revealed that cells in certain population contexts displayed as much asa20 - foldlowervariationthanrandomlyselectedcells ( insetFig . 2a ) . When we analysed this variance relative to the mean CME activity in these groups of cells ( coefficient of variation ) , we observed a threefold lower coefficient of variation in cells with a high local cell density ( Fig . 2b ) . This indicates that these cells have , besides a high CME activity , mechanisms in place that exert a tight control on this activity . The finding that much of the variation in virus infection , endocy - tosis and lipid composition of the cell surface is deterministically establishedbytheadaptationofcellstotheirpopulationcontextrevealsafundamentalprobleminourcurrentmethodsofstudyingdifferencesintheseactivitiesbetweencellpopulations . We illustrate this by com - paring the fraction of cells infected with dengue virus ( Fig . 2c ) and the single - celldistributionsofCMEactivity ( Fig . 2d ) betweenunperturbed populations of different sizes . The activities display levels that are stati - stically different ( respectively P 5 2 . 4 3 10 2 6 and P , 10 2 10 ) between the different unperturbed populations . However , after normalization ofbothactivitieswithactivitiespredictedbytheirrespectivemodels , no significant differences were found ( P values of respectively 0 . 97 and 0 . 75 ) . This is the correct conclusion , as both populations were un - perturbed and only differed in their population context . A similar problem exists with supervised and unsupervised clustering methods .

All rights reserved ©2009 states ( SupplementaryFig . 3 ) , theywillnotrevealwhetherthesepheno - typic states are determined by cellular adaptations to the population context . Therefore , these methods will be unable to distinguish between a change in cellular activity that is a consequence of an altered population context and a change that is a consequence of a direct perturbation . Besides these fundamental implications , our analysis reveals suggestions for the mechanisms underlying population - determined heterogeneity of virus infection ( see ranking in Fig . 1d and Sup - plementary Fig . 4 ) . The infection efficiency of rotavirus is strongly increased in cells that grow in sparsely populated areas . Indeed , rota - virus uses integrins as its receptor 23 , which are probably highly expressed on the surface of cells that grow sparsely 24 . MHV , on the contrary , prefers to infect cells that grow at high local density , similar to where CME is most active . Dengue virus infection occurs almost exclusively in cells located on the edge of cell islets , indicating that it relies on mechanisms highly active in polarized cells 25 . The heterogeneity signature of SV40 infection demonstrated a particular preference for large and spread - out cells in both cancer - and non - cancer - derived cell lines ( see below ) . As these cells are pre - dominantly located on the edge of cell islets and in areas that are sparsely populated , they also have higher amounts of GM1 on the cell surface ( Fig . 1D ) , the receptor for SV40 11 , 12 . In addition , we previously found that focal adhesion kinase ( FAK or PTK2 ) is required for SV40 infection 8 , and regulatory links between the micro - environment of cells and FAK 24 , and between FAK and sphingolipid membrane domains , have been reported 26 , 27 . To test whether FAK and GM1 can be placed in a causal network that determines the heterogeneity pattern of SV40 infection , we applied Bayesian network learning 5 ( Supplementary Methods ) on single - cell measurements of SV40 infection , amount of GM1 on the cell surface , level of Y397 - phosphorylated ( activated ) FAK and population - determined phenotypic properties ( Fig . 3a and Sup - plementary Fig . 5 ) . We chose to use MCF10A cells to point out the relevance of these phenomena also for non - cancer - derived , normal diploid cells . This identified a unique causal network that combines single - cell microenvironmental parameters with molecular com - ponents and virus infection ( Fig . 3b ) . We found that cell density is coupled to the regulation of cell size through GM1 cell surface content , and FAK activation . The last two are also determinants of SV40 infection , in addition to as yet unidentified factors that are regulated by cell density . We validated three causal interactions in the Bayesian network . Exogenous addition of GM1 to MCF10A cells increased thelevels of phosphorylated FAK andincreased SV40 infec - tion . Additionally , knockdown of FAK by RNA interference strongly decreased SV40 infection ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Thus , by applying quantitative data - driven modelling on a combination of micro - environmental , cellular and molecular parameters , we reveal mech - anistic insights into the establishment of cellular heterogeneity . We next wondered why the heterogeneity of SV40 infection is more deterministic ( 74 % explained ) than the GM1 levels and FAK activity on which it depends ( respectively 30 % and 65 % explained ) ( Fig . 3b ) .

All rights reserved ©2009 between GM1 and FAK by exogenous addition of GM1 , we observed a 2 . 5 - fold stronger activation of FAK in sparse cells compared with dense cells ( Fig . 3c ) . This indicates that GM1 and FAK synergize in sparse cells , leading to the more deterministic downstream activity of SV40 infection . Such synergistic mechanisms can partly cancel out the intrinsic and uncorrelated noise of individual components , increasing the deterministic nature of complex activities at the cel - lular level 2 , 28 . We have shown that much of the variation in virus infection , endocytosis and membrane lipid composition is determined by the adaptation of cells to their population context , and uncovered basic predictive principles by which non - differentiated cells create com - plex patterns of activity . Similar mechanisms may determine the heterogeneity of other cellular processes . Perturbation screens , com - bined with quantitative modelling of single cells in their population context , will further reveal the molecular networks that regulate het - erogeneity patterns in cell populations . The principles described here most likely operate in all systems of collective cellular behaviour , from prokaryotic colonies to multicellular organisms . METHODS SUMMARY Allhumancelllinesweremaintainedunderstandardtissuecultureconditions . All assays were performed in 96 - well plates , and cells were imaged on automated widefield cellWoRx microscopes ( Applied Precision ) or ImageXpress Micro microscopes ( Molecular Devices ) with 3 10 or 3 20 magnification . Infection assays were performed as described ( Supplementary Information ) . CME was measured using Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated transferrin , and GM1 levels were visualized using cholera toxin B conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 as described 8 . Phosphorylated - FAK [ Y397 ] was visualized by using standard indirect immuno - fluorescence protocols . High - content single - cell image analysis was performed using CellProfiler 29 and additional image analysis algorithms written specifically for this study ( Supplementary Information ) . In short , cells were identified by object detection on DAPI images , and these regions were typically expanded to cover the cytoplasm . Shape features and features describing the texture and intensities in all channels were extracted for these regions of interest . Support vector machine learning was applied ( P . Ra¨mo¨ , R . Sacher , B . Snijder , B . Begemannand L . Pelkmans , submitted ) for the classification ofdiverse cellular phenotypes , including interphase , mitotic and apoptotic cellular states , as well as infectious phenotypes and technical artefacts . Globally , these data were further analysed using several statistical methods . First , graphical Gaussian modelling quantified how a population shapes the property distributions of individual cells and how individual properties influence each other , which was experimentally validated by live cell imaging . Second , probit regression modelling revealed how virus infection depends on population - determined properties of individual cells , asdidweightedlinearregressionforGM1contentandCME . Finally , bootstrapped Bayesian network learning was applied to identify causal interactions between properties of the microenvironment , FAK - phosphorylation , GM1 content and SV40infectioninMCF10Acells .
