" 2 Abstract . This paper describes an application framework supporting Collaborative Handheld Decision - Making ( CHDM ) . The main characteristics of the framework are : ( 1 ) extensive usage of visual elements and gestures ; and ( 2 ) independence from specific decision - making methods , processes and tasks . The research departed from the analysis and systematization of several CHDM scenarios , highlighting repeatable behavior across multiple decision - making contexts . From these scenarios we distilled a coherent set of common functional requirements organized in three main categories : process , macro and micro functionality . The proposed framework has been validated at length through the development of several CHDM tools . Six different tools are described in the paper . The main contribution of this work is a common foundation for developing CHDM tools . Keywords : Collaborative Handheld Decision - Making ; Group Support Systems ; Mobile Devices . 1 . Introduction Collaborative Handheld Decision - Making ( CHDM ) concerns the use of handheld tools to support collaborative and decision - making activities in varied application areas such as managing clinical patient information in hospital environments ( Lapinsky , 2006 ; Yu , Houston , Ray , Garner , & Berner , 2007 ) , supporting learning activities in the classroom ( Zurita , Antunes , Baloian , & Baytelman , 2007 ) and controlling production processes in the field ( Bange , Deutscher , Larsen , Linsley , & Whiteside , 2004 ) . The main 3 contributions of CHDM include increased convenience , extended information access , improved knowledge management , up - to - date information distribution , and collaboration independently of time and space ( Srivastava , 2005 ) . This technology has already achieved a noteworthy penetration in complex work environments . For instance , Miller et al ( 2004 ) found out that 26 . 2 % physicians in USA were already using handheld tools ; and 66 . 8 % were expecting to rely more on this technology in the future . The decreasing costs , improved dependability and increasing user - interface friendliness will certainly contribute to boost the acceptance of CHDM tools . CHDM presents a wide scope of concerns and perspectives , bringing together researchers from diverse fields like decision sciences , organizational sciences , cognitive sciences , small groups research , computer supported collaborative work and ubiquitous computing ( Bragge , Merisalo - Rantanen , Nurmi , & Tanner , 2006 ) . Most of the research in this area is grounded in the pioneering work of Davies and colleagues ( Davies , Blair , Cheverst , & Firday , 1994 ; Davies , Mitchell , Cheverst , & Blair , 1998 ) . Their initial studies explored the challenges associated with building the technological infrastructure necessary to simultaneously support mobility and collaboration , emphasizing technical issues such as connectivity , distribution and interoperability . This area of concern remains highly relevant today , although the requirements have become more challenging regarding networks’ reliability , users’ reachability , event propagation and information pushing ( Messeguer , et al . , 2009 ; Sousa , Preguiça , & Baquero , 2009 ) . Several studies have been trying to understand the major problems associated with mobility and collaboration in specific applications . These studies contribute to 4 understand the main intervening factors in various CHDM contexts . For instance , CHDM in geocollaboration is highly correlated with geographical relationships ( Antunes & André , 2006 ; Cai , et al . , 2005 ; MacEachren , 2005 ; MacEachren & Brewer , 2004 ; Nyerges , Montejano , Oshiro , & Dadswell , 1997 ) , situation modeling is affected by feedback ( Š kraba , Kljaji ć , & Bor š tnar , 2007 ) , strategic visualization is highly influenced by the human - machine interface ( Monzani , Bendahan , & Pigneur , 2004 ) , and emergency management depends on situation awareness ( Bergstrand & Landgren , 2009 ; Sapateiro & Antunes 2009 ) . But the focus on specific applications has lead research towards a fragmented body of knowledge . The main consequence is the lack of a comprehensive framework identifying and bringing together CHDM features across multiple applications . This paper describes our attempt at building and consolidating a comprehensive CHDM framework , while offering a common foundation for developing CHDM tools through reusability and composition . This framework is positioned above the infrastructure level and below the application level , thus targeting a middle layer that has been somewhat neglected by research ( Laso - Ballesteros & Salmelin , 2005 ) . The adopted research methodology is founded on “design as a valid and valuable research methodology because the engineering research culture places explicit value on incrementally effective applicable problem solutions” ( Peffers , Tuunanen , Trothenberger , & Chatterjee , 2007 ) . The underpinning of the framework started from the systematic study of a collection of representative scenarios of use : real - world situations were handheld tools have been used to support collaboration and decision - making . The study revealed a set of functional requirements covering CHDM across the 5 selected scenarios of use . From these functional requirements , we developed a set of reusable software components running in the Windows Mobile platform . These components have been used to implement a number of CHDM tools . Six such tools are described in the paper : NOMAD , MCSKETCHER , SENSEMAKING , MCSUPPORTER , MCKC and MCSHELL . The proposed framework was therefore validated through its systematic use in application development . The remaining sections of this paper are organized in the following way . The next section describes the scenarios that motivated the application framework . Section three derives a set of functional requirements from the discussed scenarios . Section four describes the application framework . Section five describes the tools that have been developed to validate the framework . Section six reviews the related work . Finally , in section seven we discuss the major outcomes of this research . 2 . Considered Scenarios Application frameworks serve to build applications in consistent , efficient and practical ways . But they may only accomplish these goals if they are deeply entrenched in the real - world context of use . They must therefore supply the conceptual elements necessary to identify and resolve repeatable design problems as well as a set of system components that may be pulled together in varied contexts for different purposes , easing the trajectory from conception to implementation . To accomplish these fundamental goals , we rooted our framework on a collection of scenarios that have for long been our focus of research and development . The following paragraphs briefly describe the 6 scenarios ( see ( Zurita , Antunes , Baloian , Carriço , & Baytelman , 2008 ) for complementary information ) . Deliberation : This scenario is mostly related with rational decision making . The fundamental purpose of deliberation is to reach a decision by systematically going through a set of stages ( Antunes , Zurita , Baloian , & Sapateiro , 2013 ) . One remarkable example is the intelligence - design - choice approach described by Simon ( 1977 ) . Deliberation requires a considerable preoccupation with the decision process , because failure may have severe organizational impact and the problems and solutions tend to be complex . Deliberations often endure a lifecycle with several consecutive decision steps . The process participants are carefully selected and previously briefed about the process and intended goals . The role of the leader / facilitator ( Kolfschoten , Hengst - Bruggeling , & Vreede , 2006 ) is fundamental to focus the participants on the process while avoiding typical negative factors such as repetitions , digressions and destructive conflicts . Regarding the process structure , we observe that deliberation integrates asynchronous activities such as agenda preparation , preliminary discussion and decision wrap - up , with synchronous activities typically held in face - to - face meetings . Considering the need to orchestrate all these activities , two important requirements emerge from the deliberation scenario : ( 1 ) orchestrating the process steps necessary to reach a deliberation ; and ( 2 ) sharing the problems , agenda topics , discussions , opinions and decisions produced throughout the various process steps . Specifically regarding the role of handheld tools in this context , we observe their main focus should be supporting 7 synchronous and asynchronous access to task - related outcomes . As described above , the process is strongly dependent on the leader / facilitator , which diminishes the possible contributions of handheld tools . Consultation : The consultation scenario is associated with an ill - defined or unexpected reality . The most significant differences to deliberation are that the expected outcomes may be unclear and the decision process may depend on various contingencies . The fundamental purpose of a consultation is mobilizing various stakeholders having diverse information and competencies towards the identification of the best strategy to tackle a problem . The consultation scenario may be regarded as an aggregate of several working groups , each one having different goals and participants . From the outset , it may resemble an organized chaos , where the participants flexibly move across working groups while contributing with their expertise to resolve a wide variety of problems . This behavior has for instance been observed in collaboratories ( Mark , 2002 ) . Regarding the role of handheld tools in this process , we highlight the critical support to group management . Handheld tools may help the participants dealing with chaos : setting up working groups , defining tasks , sub - tasks and to - do lists , and integrating task - related outcomes from different working groups , thus supporting context and situation awareness ( Sapateiro & Antunes 2009 ) . Aligning : Information sharing is the major requirement characterizing this scenario . Information sharing is essential to maintain organizational structures : supervisors need 8 to communicate with their subordinates to define goals and activities , and obtain the feedback necessary to adjust plans and schedules ; and coworkers also must share information to adjust task dependencies and work flows . The aligning scenario may thus be decentralized ( co - workers ) or centrally moderated ( supervisors ) . The role of handheld tools in this scenario is to overcome physical constraints to communication . One example is allowing the participants tracking shared information while moving around the physical workspace ( Antunes & André , 2006 ) . Ritualization : The ritualization process is mostly focused on building social ties ( The 3M Meeting Management Team , 1994 ) . The reasons underlying this process are varied and include , for instance , conveying organizational culture , norms , practices and rituals , as well as fostering teambuilding ( Webne - Behrman , 1998 ) . The process is usually simple and critically centered on the leader / facilitator , who is responsible for conveying cultural signals , stimulating assimilation and developing team culture . The outcomes of ritualization are mostly intangible , e . g . motivation , satisfaction and sense of belonging . Therefore , information management requirements are quite low . The role of handheld tools in this scenario is most probably sporadic , centered on information diffusion and restricted to few participants . Ideation : The fundamental goal of ideation is supporting a divergent decision - making process where the participants seek to increase the amount of information available about a problem ( Reinig & Briggs , 2006 ) . In general , most ideation techniques rely on the brainstorming principles defined by Osborn ( 1963 ) : free - wheeling is welcomed , 9 quantity is wanted , criticism is avoided and combination and improvement are sought . The critical role supported by handheld tools in this scenario is stimulating parallel production while giving awareness about the others’ contributions . Exploration : The exploration process is characterized by the need to develop novel solutions to demanding problems . This usually requires building group stories ( Kankainen , Vaajakallio , Kantola , & Mattelmäki , 2012 ) and structuring information in creative ways ( Shneiderman , 2002 ) . Some particular characteristics of handheld tools may significantly contribute to this process . For instance , mobility and unobtrusiveness both contribute to explore ideas within the physical context . Furthermore , these tools support sketching , visual symbols and spatial relationships , thus contributing to explore solutions rapidly and efficiently ( Forbus , Ferguson , & Usher , 2001 ) . As some other scenarios , this one brings forward the requirement to integrate the public and private dimensions of collaborative work : in many circumstances some work pieces have to be initiated , explored and detailed in privacy by the author , to be made public only when sufficiently matured . Learning : This scenario is focused on knowledge structuring and reflection with support and guidance from a knowledgeable person . It emphasizes the role of technology supporting the learning goals and strategies . In this respect , handheld tools may help guiding the participants throughout learning activities and orchestrating divergent and convergent working modes , which are often found in learning strategies . According to Tyran and Sherpherd ( 2001 ) , the degree of anonymity supported by these 10 tools helps reducing evaluation apprehension by allowing group members to contribute without exposing themselves ; and parallelism may help reducing domination effects , since more persons may express their ideas at the same time . In Table 1 we summarize the main characteristics of the considered scenarios . Table 1 . Summary table of CHDM scenarios .

Functional Requirements 3 . 1 . Taxonomy adopted to classify functional requirements The scenarios described in the previous section constitute a collection of insightful “stories” about decision - making processes and their goals , contexts , roles , and potential functionality brought by handheld tools . From this collection we have to construct a 11 coherent list of requirements , stressing common functionality and repeatable behavior across all scenarios . To accomplish this goal , we need a taxonomy that may be consistently applied . Several taxonomies identifying the decision - making elements relevant to our discussion have been proposed in the research literature . One of the earliest and mostly cited ones is the task - process taxonomy ( Fjermestad & Hiltz , 1999 ; Nunamaker , Dennis , Valacich , Vogel , & George , 1991 ) , which differentiates between task structure , focused on the specific group conditions in focal situations such as brainstorming , and process structure , addressing the more general conditions under which the group organizes activities and accomplishes goals . Other taxonomies highlight the distinctions between hardware , software and people ( Kraemer & King , 1988 ) , coordination modes ( Malone & Crowston , 1994 ) , collaborative services ( Bafoutsou & Mentzas , 2002 ) , facilitation support ( Antunes & Ho , 2001 ) and other even more specific requirements . In our research we adopted the general purpose of the task - process taxonomy , however separating the task dimension in two categories : • Task dimension o Macro level – Regards the task from the perspective of the group , i . e . the conditions under which the participants collaborate to accomplish their goals . o Micro level – Regards the task from the perspective of the individual participants , addressing the conditions under which they contribute to the task . • Process dimension 12 o Adopts a broad perspective over the decision - making process , including the assumption that a collection of tasks may have to be managed to improve the group’s performance . Using this taxonomy , we analyzed our collection of scenarios to come up with a list of the most relevant requirements . In Table 2 we summarize the several requirements that were captured this way . These requirements are discussed in more detail in the following section . Table 2 . Main requirements extracted from the scenarios . Details are discussed in section 3 . 2 .

Elicited requirements We start with the process functionality . The first requirement we identify is managing working groups (  ) . This functionality is necessary to distribute the participants through multiple concurrent activities , which were posited by the consultation scenario . The facilitator should be the person responsible for creating groups and assigning participants to groups . Another requirement is managing process steps (  ) . The purpose is extending the activity decomposition introduced by the previous requirement with a more fine - grained specification of the assigned activities . Typically , such decomposition is either task - oriented or goal - oriented . In the former case , the decision process might be structured as a list of consecutive tasks . This is the type of decomposition suggested by the deliberation scenario . The later case concerns a list of issues or topics that should be addressed by the group . The learning scenario suggests this type of decomposition . The type of decomposition more adequate to a specific case is left to the facilitator to decide . Process steps may be conceptually defined as a list where each element corresponds to a particular problem , task or goal , although establishing loose relationships between them . This looseness allows adapting the process to the specific contingencies and complexity of the problem at hand . It should be noted that we currently restrict a working group to have one single list of process steps . Another process functionality emerging from the scenarios concerns managing synchronous and asynchronous modes (  ) . The synchronous mode engages a group in same - time collaboration , while the asynchronous mode allows the group members to determine individually when to collaborate . For example , the aligning case suggests a 14 synchronous mode , while the consultation scenario is clearly implying the adoption of an asynchronous mode . The synchronous / asynchronous modes may be defined for each process step . At any moment , the facilitator may select a process step and specify that the collaboration mode will be synchronous or asynchronous . In the former case , all group members will immediately share the information associated with the process step , while in the later case information sharing is deferred until a member makes an explicit request . This type of functionality supports the active role of the facilitator in determining which collaboration modes are more appropriate to specific tasks and goals . Managing centralized and decentralized modes (  ) complements the synchronous / asynchronous modes with the capacity to specify who may actively manage the task outcomes . In the centralized case , only the facilitator can modify the information associated with a process step , while the remaining participants act as passive information consumers . The aligning scenario mandates this type of functionality . In the decentralized case , all assigned participants may modify the information associated with a process step . The ideation and exploration scenarios , which usually are based on parallel production , are a good fit for this mode . The managing divergent and convergent modes (  ) functionality complements the centralized / decentralized modes with the capacity to control the participants’ focus of attention . In the convergent case , only one process step is made available to the participants . This mode is adequate for collaborative situations where the group should be kept strictly focused on the same task or topic , e . g . , the deliberation scenario . 15 In the divergent mode , all process steps are simultaneously available to the participants . This mode allows the participants to wander through the steps independently from each other , working in parallel and developing different strategies to contribute to the group , as suggested by the consultation and exploration scenarios . Regarding the task - macro functionality , the first requirement we consider is sharing task - related outcomes (  ) . Each process step is expected to produce various data . For instance , typical deliberation scenarios lead to the creation of agenda items , problems , ideas , solutions , actions and priorities . Independently of the working modes that may be considered ( synchronous / asynchronous , centralized / decentralized , divergent / convergent ) , the group members must have a shared view over these data elements . We thus define that each process step must have an associated shared workspace . The shared workspace inherits all the properties of the process step ( working group and working modes ) and confers these properties to the resident data elements . The main purpose of the moving between working groups and process steps (  ) functionality is allowing group members to switch their focus of attention to different working groups and process steps . This may only be possible if both the departing and arriving process steps have divergent modes assigned by the facilitator . The effect is switching the participant’s current workspace . The purpose of managing private and public information (  ) is covering a personal dimension of work that has not been considered so far : often activities require managing information with discretion before exposing them to the group . In many other cases it is more productive to avoid annoying the group with frequent data modifications . These situations may clearly occur in the exploration and ritualization 16 scenarios . We may thus define that each process step , besides having a shared workspace , may also have one private workspace for each working group member . We now move on to the task - micro functionality . The first requirement to consider is sketching , writing and editing (  ) . Sketching is particularly important because of the considerable opportunities it gives to organize task - based outcomes . For instance , sketches may serve to visually integrate ideas and comments into high - level concepts , especially in exploration scenarios . In a broad perspective , sketching may be used to establish visual relationships between the information present in a workspace . Editing accomplishes a set of standard actions ( copy , paste , insert , edit , delete , etc . ) that may be executed over the data elements present in a workspace . We consider four data types : sketches , cursive text , typed text , and pictures . Cursive text is a kind of sketch that is translated into text by humans . The listing , relating and structuring (  ) requirement expands the notion of workspace previously defined . Listing highlights the need to implement a very common type of task - related outcomes : the list . Lists are highly pervasive in decision - making , appearing recurrently in the form of to - do lists , wrap - ups , goals , solutions , votes , priorities , etc . For instance , the ideation scenario fundamentally aims to build a list of ideas . The relating and structuring features support complex task - related outcomes such as action plans and decision trees . These structures may be implemented with hierarchical workspaces . We may therefore define that a workspace ( private or shared ) may have child workspaces that inherit the properties of their parents . The child workspaces may be navigated by using anchors available in the parent’s workspace . 17 3 . 3 . Summary Overall , the identified requirements bring forward several functional elements necessary to manage CHDM . This includes defining working groups , process steps and hierarchical workspaces . By adopting this generic structure , we seek to organize work processes independently from the specific decision - making constraints that may be imposed by the application domain . Working groups support concurrent work , while process steps serve to decompose the decision - making process . The various working modes that may be assigned to process steps support facilitators when organizing the tasks necessary to accomplish the designated goals with flexibility and adaptation to the circumstances . The task - related outcomes reside in workspaces . Workspaces may be private or shared , hierarchically decomposed , and inherit the working modes of the parent’s process steps . We highlighted one important type of task - related outcomes : lists . Beyond lists , we considered cursive text , typed text , sketches and pictures . As we show in the next section , these are the main building blocks of the proposed CHDM framework . 4 . Application Framework The developed application framework is illustrated in Figure 1 . It defines three functional layers : communications , data model and user interface . These layers , which were derived from patterns for generating layered architectures ( Coplien & Schmidt , 1995 ) , will be discussed in detail in the following sections . 18 Figure 1 . Application framework . 4 . 1 . Communications layer Mobile computing imposes some specific requirements to the communication layer when compared with those imposed by desktop computing : Ad - hoc networking : In many mobile scenarios , the only available network may be an ad - hoc network provided by mobile devices , which can roam around at their own will ( Neyem , Ochoa , & Pino , 2008 ) . Since the connectivity may be intermittent , the application framework must dynamically manage groups according with their availability (  ) . This also means that the communications architecture must follow a peer - to - peer schema . Data synchronization : In a peer - to - peer architecture there is no central server keeping a master copy of the data . Every mobile device must replicate and synchronize data (  ) . There are mainly two ways to do it in a peer - to - peer architecture : by event or by state . By event means that all mobile devices start with exactly the same state and propagate events 19 in a way that preserves the same state on all devices . If one data object is concurrently changed in one device , that change must be serialized and propagated to the other ones . Synchronizing by state means that from time to time the whole data structure must be propagated and reconciled . If the data structure is very complex , or the object changes are highly concurrent , the state - based synchronization will cause more network traffic than the event - based . But in an ad - hoc environment where mobile devices may not be constantly reachable , the state - based synchronization can actually be more effective , as it allows work to proceed without serialization . Thus the framework data synchronization scheme adopts the state - based approach . The communications layer consists of a set of classes implementing an application programming interface that the programmer may use to share data objects . These classes are available in Java and C # and implement the necessary mechanisms for creating and replicating object instances . They also encapsulate the functionality necessary to discover which mobile devices are present in the ad - hoc network , convert data objects from their internal representations into XML ( Extensible Markup Language ) and transmit data between the connected replicas . And finally , they also encapsulate the data synchronization mechanisms necessary to reconcile data among the connected replicas . The communications layer sends multicast messages at regular intervals to detect the presence of mobile devices and to reconcile data . 20 4 . 2 . Data model Figure 2 : A simplified class diagram describing the data model . Figure 1 identifies the main concepts managed by the data model , while Figure 2 shows the most important class diagrams implementing these concepts . These classes are common to most of the CHDM tools we have developed so far and may be grouped in three categories : session management , workspace support and gesturing support . The Application class is the main class of the application being developed which instantiates the necessary objects required to implement its functionality . The WorkSession class implements session management . It allows the facilitator to define working groups (  ) , which are dynamically updated with information coming from the communications layer ( Communication class ) indicating who is actually connected to the ad - hoc network . The facilitator also specifies the process steps (  ) by defining a list of SketchContainer objects . 21 The SketchContainer class is the most complex data element supported by the framework , as it implements the workspace concept . It constitutes a repository for sketches ( Sketch class ) and other data elements . Sketches are created with the support from the Gesture class , which implements various types of user inputs using hand gestures (  ) . Some of these gestures allow creating lists of SketchContainer instances and links to child SketchContainer instances (  ) . The Sketch class inherits the properties of the Shareable class , which allows sharing task - related outcomes (  ) . The SketchContainer class controls and enforces a set of behavioral properties that have been already discussed : synchronous / asynchronous mode , determining when data synchronization is enforced (  ) ; centralized / decentralized mode , controlling what replicas of the SketchContainer are allowed to receive sketches from the users (  ) ; divergent / convergent mode , controlling when the workspace is presented to the user (  ) ; public / private mode , controlling which Sketch instances are replicated to the group (  ) and which are not ; and also controlling how the users may navigate the SketchContainer objects (  ) . 4 . 3 . User interface As expected , the user interface is organized according with process , task - macro and task - micro functionality . Whenever possible , the supported interactions are pen - based . Only the facilitator has access to process functionality : managing working groups , process steps and working modes . Groups are defined by dragging the users’ icons to working - group icons , as shown in Figure 3 . Process steps are managed by manipulating a list with names identifying the tasks / goals . Figure 4 shows how the list is displayed to 22 the facilitator . The working modes are selected in menu options displayed to the facilitator .  Figure 3 - Assigning participants to working groups : The working groups are represented by rectangles ( Groups 1 - 3 ) . Icons labeled with the corresponding name visually represent the participants .  Figure 4 – Defining process steps for a meeting agenda . The three list elements shown at the center ( advantages , disadvantages and success factors ) define the meeting activities .  23 Figure 5 – Convergent mode . Only one process step is active allowing , in this example , two participants drawing over the same picture at the same time . Considering the task - macro functionality , the user - interface is mostly focused on managing workspaces . Workspaces serve to place and visualize sketches and other data elements , and may extend beyond the display size through drag movements with the pen . The typical scrollbars were omitted to maximize display space , which is very limited in many mobile devices . Figure 5 shows a shared workspace where the participants have drawn ideas for new elements to improve the layout of a park . A photograph of the park has been used as background of the workspace . There are two types of data elements in this workspace : sketches ( tree , road ) and anchors to other workspaces ( yellow spots ) . The data elements resident in a workspace are displayed according with the inherited synchronous / asynchronous working modes : the synchronous mode implies that all data elements in the workspace are displayed almost simultaneously , while the asynchronous mode implies the user must explicitly request synchronization . This request is accomplished through a menu option . Figure 5 shows activity in a synchronous mode : all users see the same workspace . Awareness elements in the form of rectangles are displayed in order to inform that other users are sketching on that area . Figure 6 shows an activity in divergent mode , as users are working on different workspaces . 24  Figure 6 – Divergent mode . Several process steps are active , allowing concurrent viewing . The participant at the left is creating process steps while the participant shown at the right is already working on a step .  Figure 7 – The “offer area” . At the left , the participant exports an item to the offer area . At the right , the receiving participant imports the item to the private workspace . As we mentioned before , every process step , besides having a shared workspace , has also a private workspace for each participant . Visually , the private and shared workspaces are shown the same way . The option to view the public or shared workspace is selected in a menu . To extend the value of private workspaces , we support exchanging private data elements between several members of the working group . This functionality was implemented with a visual interface designated “offer area” ( Figure 7 ) , which serves to export data elements ( sketches , text , etc . ) to selected group members . These members 25 will be presented with the offer area and may import the information to their private workspaces . Moving between working groups and process steps required the implementation of the overview window shown in Figure 8 . This window shows the available groups , corresponding process steps and workspace hierarchy . The participants may select one of these elements by clicking with the pen . We note however this functionality depends on the specified working mode : the participants do not have access to the overview window if they are in convergent mode ; in that case only the facilitator has access to the overview window to select a different step and guide the participants . The synchronous / asynchronous and centralized / decentralized modes have no impact on this functionality .  Figure 8 – Moving between working groups and process steps through the overview window . Let us now describe the task - micro functionality . Sketching and writing deal with cursive text , typed text and sketches . Cursive text allows writing down pieces of text using the pen , while typed text allows writing text using a virtual keyboard . The interactions with these data elements are based on pen - based gestures . 26 Sketching also serves to organize task - based outcomes and visually integrate information into high - level concepts . For instance , in Figure 9 we illustrate how several list items are visually organized in a typical SWOT ( Strengths , Weaknesses , Opportunities , and Threats ) diagram . Sketches may also be done over pictures ( Figure 10 ) .  Figure 9 – Using sketches to relate information .  Figure 10 – Sketches over pictures . Several pen - based gestures have been developed to edit data elements . A single tap allows selecting one element . Drawing a “double closed shape” allows selecting several elements present in the workspace ( Figure 11 ) . Drawing a “connected cross” over one or several elements implements the erase function . Rotation , resizing and other 27 advanced editing features were also implemented . The cut , copy , paste and delete functions are available through contextual menus . The creation of lists is also based on pen gestures . To create a list , the user writes down some few words using the pen ( e . g . , “reduce cost” ) and then turns those words into a list item by drawing a special gesture recognized by the framework : an horizontal line between two sketches ( Figure 12 ) . After creating a list , the user may then manage the list items either individually ( e . g . , moving an item up or down the list , see Figure 12 , bottom ) or as group ( e . g . , moving the list within the workspace ) .  Figure 11 – a ) The “connected cross” deletes data elements ; b ) the “double closed shape” serves to select data elements ; c ) the “select and move dot” resizes objects ; and d ) the “select and rotate dot” rotates the data element . The relating and structuring functionality is based on hierarchical workspaces and anchors . A child workspace may be created through the specification of an anchor . The anchor is a visual object placed in the workspace to indicate that there is the possibility to move down the hierarchy . To create an anchor , the user first has to write some words 28 and then turn those words into an anchor by drawing a special gesture : a line bending from the vertical to the horizontal . Double - clicking the anchor leads the user towards the sibling workspace . Moving up the workspace hierarchy requires clicking on a special icon , as shown in Figure 13 .  Figure 12 – Managing lists . Top : creating list item . Bottom : moving list item .  Figure 13 – Moving up and down the workspace hierarchy with anchors . 5 . Validation The framework described in the previous section has been validated through the development of several applications . Some parts of the framework were developed for the first application and reused in almost all subsequent ones , while other parts were developed to resolve more specific design problems . A platform implementing the 29 required low - level functionality , including ad - hoc networking , data sharing , synchronization , and use - interface elements , has been developed for the first application and then reused for all the other applications . The platform is described in detail in another paper ( Baloian , Zurita , Antunes , & Baytelman , 2007 ) . In this paper we will instead focus on demonstrating how the framework elements effectively support CHDM in the selected meeting scenarios . NOMAD : This was the first developed application . It runs on mobile devices and supports collaboration in the field , where participants generate , discuss , refine and prioritize ideas for further discussion in the office ( Zurita & Baloian , 2005 ) . The mobile nature of the application makes it possible to start a decision process anytime and anyplace . It uses pen - based gestures to allow users creating a discussion agenda and other common meeting elements ( Figure 2 ) . Each list item can be expanded to a whole - screen page by double - clicking on it , in order to annotate the outcomes of the discussion . Freehand sketching and writing add contents to these pages . Gesture - based edition commands are also available ( Figure 9 ) . New lists may be generated inside a page , thus creating a hierarchical tree - like structure , which can be viewed and managed using the overview page ( Figure 6 ) . A voting functionality was implemented to rank the generated ideas ( list items , and / or sub items ) . CHDM using NOMAD typically starts with the creation of the first page of a new project . The subsequent activities ( such as creating groups , linking pages , etc . ) , as well as the order they are performed , depend on what the users may need or want to do . Overall , we observed very significant flexibility implementing most collaboration arrangements falling within the limits of the scenarios 30 described in Section 2 . We have also observed very significant flexibility relative to the presence or absences of the leader / facilitator . MCSKETCHER : This application was conceived to support a group of designers generating ideas while visiting an intervention area ( G . Zurita , N . Baloian , & F . Baytelman , 2008 ) . It allows sketching design ideas over photographs taken on site ( see Figures 3 and 8 ) . Each photograph takes a workspace , but may be copied to other private or shared spaces for refining ideas . These refinements are accessed through anchors . This application implements the convergent and divergent modes , which are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 . MCSKETCHER also implements awareness mechanisms , which have revealed very helpful showing users what the others are doing . It also uses the editing features developed for the previous application , supporting the creation of rough design sketches , which might be refined in future sessions using more powerful design tools . SENSEMAKING : This application addresses the classroom scenario where a teacher assigns the task of analyzing a collection of papers to a group of students ( Zurita , et al . , 2007 ) . The papers are related with some topic , but it is part of the assigned task to find the topic and the relationships through exploration and collaboration . Each student receives one paper and must relate it with the others . Students are encouraged to engage in parallel negotiations with multiple parties to reach a common view . In this application , lists were used to organize the students ' notes about the papers . The spatial , visual and conceptual relationships ( e . g . , Figure 7 ) were also extensively 31 used . The infrared communication mechanism available on the mobile devices allowed students to engage in face - to - face collaborations with selected people . The offer area ( see Figure 5 ) is activated when the infrared signal of another device is detected , and allows students to exchange their notes with others in close physical proximity . MCSUPPORTER : This tool was developed to promote some pedagogical practices in the classroom using mobile devices ( G . Zurita , N . Baloian , & F . Baytelman , 2008 ) . It implements teacher’s and students’ modules . The teacher’s module allows assigning students to groups , creating problems , assigning problems to groups and assessing the students’ outcomes . The students’ module allows working collaboratively on assigned problems . The teacher creates groups by dragging the students’ icons to groups , as shown in figure 1 . Problems are created with pen - based sketches . Open problems require students to write or draw their solutions . Closed problems require students to choose alternatives from a list . Both questions and answers are managed as lists . Problems are distributed to the groups through workspaces . The teacher monitors the work being done by navigating the workspaces . Closed problems are managed in a centralized mode , while open problems may be decentralized . The teacher may control the focus of attention by setting a certain workspace to be seen by the whole class , for example , when an interesting answer is worth to be discussed with the whole class . MOBILE COLLABORATIVE KNOWLEDGE CREATION ( MCKC ) : This application supports knowledge creation . It runs wirelessly on mobile devices , using ad - hoc networks , but it is also able to synchronize data with a central repository . 32 Knowledge is managed through conceptual maps . Gestures are used to create and manage concepts : create , link , move , drag , etc . Users may associate concepts with external documents like text files and images . MCKC facilitates collaborative knowledge creation based on Nonaka’s SECI model ( Nonaka & Takeuchi , 1995 ) . According to this model , the application affords knowledge externalization , socialization , combination , and internalization using handheld tools . The participants exchange their notes and concept maps using the offer area ( Figure 5 ) . MCSHELL : This tool supports mobile analysis of complex socio - technical environments ( Antunes , et al . , 2008 ; Antunes , Carriço , & Bandeira , 2011 ) . It adopts the SHELL model to characterize relationships between humans , called liveware ( L ) , and four other elements of the working environment ( Edwards , 1972 ) : Hardware ( H ) ; Software ( S ) , including rules , regulations , procedures and practices ; Environment ( E ) ; and liveware ( L ) , i . e . other humans . The interfaces between SHELL elements define major areas of analysis : liveware - liveware ( L - L ) , liveware - hardware ( L - H ) , liveware - environment ( L - E ) and liveware - software ( L - S ) . These interfaces offer a structured approach to assess human factors and system requirements . MCSHELL facilitates the elicitation of SHELL elements using mobile devices . For instance , analysts have used this tool during interviews and field observations in a hospital . The tool offers features not found in pen / paper approaches : the manipulation of SHELL elements is more immediate and flexible ; and a shared workspace allows sharing details about the subjects ( liveware ) while in the field . The SHELL elements are 33 specified inside hierarchical workspaces . This way a father node and four son nodes define the L - L , L - S , L - E , L - H relationships . In Table 3 we present a summary view of the applications described above , highlighting the scenarios of use they address and the framework elements that were used . Table 3 .

Related Work In this section we discuss several CHDM frameworks recently developed ( since 2006 ) . All selected works propose some kind of application framework and involve handheld tools and collaboration support . In Table 4 we highlight the similarities and distinctions with the framework proposed in this paper . David et al . ( 2006 ) defined a framework for developing mobile collaborative applications . The main research goal was developing a graphical formalism that could transform collaborative use cases into work process specifications , which would then be executed by several underlying components implementing data distribution , sharing and collaboration . The proposed formalism addresses synchronous / asynchronous working modes (  ) and shared / private activities (  ) . It also considers session management (  ) , user and group management (  ) , data sharing (  ) and concurrency control (  ) . Neyem et al . ( 2006 ) developed a framework supporting ad - hoc data sharing for mobile collaboration (  ) . It holds upon the view that in many situations , especially those involving emergency response , had - hoc networks may compensate the collapse of structured communications networks . In these circumstances , work may change from synchronous to asynchronous on conditions extraneous to the group and task (  ) . This framework also supports centralized / decentralized work modes (  ) and shared / private activities (  ) . Bollen et al . ( 2008 ) developed an application framework supporting learning activities where mobile technology serve to decentralize data inputs and integrates with a shared whiteboard facilitating group visualization and discussion (  ) . The framework focus is on the integration of heterogeneous data and devices , encapsulating 35 the specific details of data communication , synchronization and persistency . Furthermore , the framework also supports the specification of action patterns , which serve to manage the collaboration process (  ) . 36 Table 4 .

The main research focus was set on developing the ability to automatically obtain contextualized information ( using Radio Frequency Identification ) and match that information with decision criteria . This way , while the customer wanders through the store , the handheld tool displays a dynamic matrix with pricing information . The tool helps comparing similar goods and deciding which ones to buy . 37 Cowie and Burstein ( 2007 ) developed a mobile decision - making tool . Departing from a typical multi - criteria decision - making model , the authors extended it with parameters that depend on the mobile context . Since the main research focus is restricted to the interaction between the user and the decision - making model , we only check the listing , relating and structuring functionality in Table 3 (  ) . Bastéa - Forte and Yen ( 2007 ) developed an application supporting the use of mobile devices in face - to - face brainstorming meetings . Ideas are individually sketched in mobile devices (  ) and shared in a large public whiteboard (  ) , which promotes parallel contributions and at the same time allows perceiving the group progress . Experiments highlight the application promoted even contributions and more collaboration from the group members . Lee ( 2009 ) reports the development of an application framework based on Web - based technologies to integrate information access and communication into a series of coherent services supporting mobile meetings . Various types of mobile devices may be used , with some emphasis on mobile phones . Within the list of services we find : ( 1 ) mobile information access ; ( 2 ) simultaneous voice conversations ; and ( 3 ) content navigation (  ) . Overall , we observe two functions not covered by these works : managing divergent / convergent modes and moving between working groups and process steps . This lack of support impacts the flexibility of CHDM tools , as they afford more decentralized and loose work structures . We also observe a dichotomy between support to process / macro functionality and support to micro functionality , which indicates that one potential 38 benefit of the framework proposed in this paper is the integrated management of such distinct functionality . Finally , we note that the approach proposed by David et al . ( 2006 ) has strong affinities with the one developed in this paper . However , the main focus of the cited research was the definition of a graphical specification language , instead of an application development framework . We nevertheless emphasize the significant complementarity and potential synergies between the two approaches . 7 . Discussion and Conclusions One interesting characteristic of the proposed framework is that it reconsiders and repurposes different traditions found in the decision - making body of research , which based on the research by Morton et al . ( 2003 ) we classify as tool - driven , process - driven and model - driven . The central preoccupation of tool - driven approaches is providing a set of configurable and interoperable tools supporting typical decision - making activities such as brainstorming , categorizing and voting ( Nunamaker , Briggs , Mittleman , Vogel , & Balthazard , 1997 ) . Process - driven approaches are mainly concerned with the procedural aspects of decision - making . The focus is on partitioning decision processes using the engineering paradigm , analyzing the organizational context and designing a decision - making process that may be successfully adopted by a group ( Kolfschoten & de Vreede , 2009 ; Kolfschoten , et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , model - driven approaches regard decision modeling as the gist of decision making ( Morton , et al . , 2003 ) . The emphasis is on the articulation of a common view 39 about the problem and possible solutions , usually with support from an expert facilitator that helps eliciting and organizing data , resolving conflicts , and building consensus . We observe that the proposed framework combines all facets mentioned above . In the top layer , task - micro functionality addresses decision modeling , while task - macro and process functionality tackle tool interoperability and process structuring . In the middle layer , workspaces and sketches cover the task and decision structures posited by process - driven and model - driven approaches . Finally , the bottom - layer supplies communication functionality shared by the tool , process and model - driven approaches . Therefore a distinctive characteristic of the proposed framework is specifying a comprehensive application platform that embraces functions found in other decision - making approaches but that have not been integrated until now . Furthermore , the proposed framework extends decision - making support to handheld / mobile contexts . This extension seems particularly adequate to the new types of users and professional engagements that have been recently encouraged by mobile devices and networks . In particular , we note the close relationships with “offroaders” , i . e . people who have highly developed skills and dedication to their tasks , and have the “capability to deliver solutions to problems in circumstances that others would find difficult” ( Harmer & Pauleen , 2012 ) . One interesting characteristic of “offroaders” is that , while being inseparable from mobile technology , their main focus of attention is the task and not the technology . The proposed framework contributes to enable technology support to decision making with such level of transparency . Discussing the framework elements in more detail , we note that the most distinct component is the workspace , which manages several important attributes related to data 40 sharing and decision - making : managing the groups’ focus of attention , defining interaction modes , allowing the users to move between different tasks and contents , structuring complex information , and integrating shared and private information . Such functional richness has been considered essential to support decision - making in complex settings such as distributed medical team meetings ( Kane , Groth , & Randall , 2011 ; Li & Robertson , 2011 ) . Another important framework component is the sketch . Sketches serve not only to jot text but also to establish conceptual relationships and structure workspaces . Again , very rich functionality is available to work with sketches , such as selecting and editing sketches using specific gestures . Sketching is particularly relevant to support handheld decision - making , considering they support offroaders managing information while on the move . In this paper we describe six applications developed with the framework . These applications implement different decision - making activities in quite different working contexts . Overall , with these implementations we have come to the following conclusions : • Many different decision - making tasks and processes may be developed using the proposed framework ; • The framework offers flexible support to CHDM based on a relatively small number of user - interface , data model and communications elements ; • The framework is adequate to develop decision - making applications for mobile contexts ; 41 • The burden associated with group and task management is quite low . Although the framework supports the facilitator role , it does not depend on that role and indeed allows any user to assume that role with no specific training ; • The application development on top of the framework has been surprisingly effortless . For instance , the SHELL application was developed in one week . Of course the proposed framework also brings significant challenges to several stakeholders . Let us start with application developers . One fundamental problem that application developers have to consider is structuring the application functionality using workspace hierarchies , which may be considered too low - level and too restrictive ( currently , we only support text , sketches , pictures , lists and anchors ) . Considering decision makers , we observe that the proposed framework brings about social and cultural implications . One problem is that decision makers may find themselves in the uncomfortable position of designers , i . e . having to use a graphical tool to design a decision process . To illustrate the case , we note that the developed technology provides the user - interface elements necessary to execute SWOT analysis , but the users will have to make several decisions regarding how to do it , e . g . by defining a sequence of four tasks ( Strengths , Weaknesses , Opportunities , and Threats ) or by populating four workspaces with the four types of assessments . Another significant problem to consider is that decision - makers may find it uncomfortable to use sketches . Studies with storyboarding show that non - experts often feel they lack the drawing skills necessary to use creative tools ( Truong , Hayes , & Abowd , 2006 ) , something that may be extrapolated to our case . This problem may be aggravated by mobile devices , which 42 have been considered to create several mobile impairments related with information processing and visualization ( Harper , Yesilada , & Chen , 2011 ) . We finally consider some important challenges to researchers . Gray and Mandiwalla ( 1999 ) noted that decision - making tools have ben hardly used in organizations , often because they lack a strong link to the organizational practices of the users they are trying to support . The process - driven approach addresses this problem by having collaboration engineers fine - tuning decision processes . However such an approach introduces other issues , such as the dependence on external collaboration engineers , and dealing with constant internal and external changes . The proposed application framework embraces the collaboration engineering approach and contributes to its realization by supplying visual elements , functionality and structure necessary to implement process designs with mobile devices . Another interesting research challenge is related with the current lack of standardization in the decision - making field . The proposed framework responds to this lack of standardization tackling aspects of language ( e . g . , macro and micro distinctions ) , functionality ( process , task - macro and task - micro functions ) and data model ( session management , workspace and gesturing support ) .
