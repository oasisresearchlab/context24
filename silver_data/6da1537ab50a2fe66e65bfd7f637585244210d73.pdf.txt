Breakthrough in DNA Sequencing Technology Precast Sequencing Gels Allow More Time for Valuable Research La Jolla , California . After years of research , Stratagene has just released the most advanced DNA sequencing system available . The system ' s prepoured , polyacry - lamide gels eliminate the need to manually pour sequencing gels . Until now there was no alternative to pouring your own sequencing gels . It took up to 2 hours of preparation to clean the plates , mix the solutions , de - gas the acrylamide , pour the gels and wait for polymerization . Stratagene ' s scientists have changed all that with the new CastAway ' M sequencing system . Stratagene ' s new sequencing system cuts both electro - phoresis and gel drying times in half , so researchers using the system have found they have more time available to meet their research goals . The system components have been designed to be used together . The system includes a novel vertical sequencing device and high - speed gel dryer designed to produce superior results when used with the quality - tested precast gels . Precast Sequencing Gels Are Here Superior Results in Less Time CastAway precast gels are ready to load in less than 5 minutes with no mess . While conventional procedures can take up to 6 . 5 hours to sequence a gel , the CastAway system takes as little as 2 hours . The procedure is simple : open the bag , place the gel in the sequencing device , run the gel and dry . The precast sequencing gels are thinner than standard gels , so they can be run at higher temperatures . This not only shortens run times , but also reduces the possibility of band compressions . Since the CastAway gels are bound permanently to one of the glass plates , there ' s no need for filter paper and less risk of gel tearing . And two prepoured gels fit perfectly into a standard x - ray cassette . Vacuum Pumps Have Become Obsolete New High - Speed Gel Dryer Takes Over Not only do the precast gels save run time , but the CastAway gel dryer works twice as fast as any commer - cially available gel dryer . The gel dryer is easy to load ; the precast gels slide right in . Researchers who currently use vacuum pumps to dry their gels will immediately notice the quiet operation of The CastAway TM Sequencing System the gel dryer . Not only are vacuum pumps loud and distracting , but they are expensive to purchase and main - tain . In contrast , the CastAway gel dryer is quiet , cost - effective and requires no maintenance . The new gel dryer works with the CastAway system to bring the future of sequencing into your lab . Easy Loading Sequencing Device Simple and Safe Stratagene engineers have developed a vertical sequenc - ing device that is simple and safe to operate . The new CastAway vertical sequencing device is exclusively for use with CastAway precast gels and is optimized to provide high quality results . The CastAway sequencing device features a new easy - to - use gasket ; the CastAway precast gels snap in and are ready to run . An advanced thermoplate evenly diffuses the heat during electro - phoresis , ensuring less artifacts and crisper bands . The CastAway sequencing device works twice as fast as conventional vertical sequencing devices to save even more valuable research time . The CastAway system also includes convenient , stack - able fixing trays for soaking gels after removal from the sequencing device , and a radiation storage container to store radioactive gels until safe for disposal .

N e w H e a t e d Lid for M J R e s e a r c h MiniCycler T h e r m a l Cyclers A new heated lid accessory is available for the rug - ged MJ Reseach MiniCycler , a lightweight and inex - pensive thermal cycler with a thermal range of - - 9 ~ to 105 ~ This " Baby " Hot Bonnet lid can be factory - retrofit to any MiniCycler ever made , and it allows oil - free cycling in either 0 . 5 - ml or 0 . 2 - ml tubes . Clamp - arm action applies pressure to the tubes so thermal transfer to the tops and bottoms of the ves - sels is excellent . There is no need for oil in the tube to prevent refluxing , nor in the well to enhance thermal contact . In order not to compromise the utility of the MiniCycler for general - purpose incubation , the regu - lar cold lid has been retained . For non - cycling incu - bations , the Baby Bonnet simply rests idly on the right side of the instrument .
