The PAK system links Rho GTPase signaling to thrombin - mediated platelet activation . Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 305 : C519 – C528 , 2013 . First published June 19 , 2013 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpcell . 00418 . 2012 . — Regulation of the platelet actin cytoskeleton by the Rho family of small GTPases is essential for the proper maintenance of hemostasis . However , little is known about how intracellular platelet activation from Rho GTPase family members , including Rac , Cdc42 , and Rho , translate into changes in platelet actin structures . To better understand how Rho family GTPases coordinate platelet activation , we identiﬁed platelet proteins associated with Rac1 , a Rho GTPase family member , and actin regulatory protein essential for platelet hemostatic function . Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that upon platelet activation with thrombin , Rac1 associates with a set of effectors of the p21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) , including GIT1 , (cid:1) PIX , and guanine nucleotide ex - change factor GEFH1 . Platelet activation by thrombin triggered the PAK - dependent phosphorylation of GIT1 , GEFH1 , and other PAK effectors , including LIMK1 and Merlin . PAK was also required for the thrombin - mediated activation of the MEK / ERK pathway , Akt , calcium signaling , and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) exposure . Inhibition of PAK signaling prevented thrombin - induced platelet aggregation and blocked platelet focal adhesion and lamellipodia formation in response to thrombin . Together , these results demonstrate that the PAK signaling system is a key orchestrator of platelet actin dynamics , linking Rho GTPase activation downstream of thrombin stimulation to PAK effector function , MAP kinase activation , calcium signaling , and PS exposure in platelets . actin ; PAK ; platelets ; Rac1 ; Rho GTPases HEMOSTASIS IS MEDIATED AT a cellular level by platelets ( 18 , 23 , 46 ) . Platelets are molecularly tuned to detect disruptions of vascular integrity and to aggregate with one another at sites of vessel injury to form thrombi and effectively halt bleeding . Platelets are rapidly activated following binding to extracellu - lar matrix proteins , such as collagen , and exposure to soluble agonists , such as the serine protease thrombin . During activa - tion , platelets undergo a dramatic change in shape from discs to form ﬁnger - like ﬁlopodia and actin - rich sheets of lamellipodia on surfaces ( 32 , 56 , 57 ) . At a cell physiological level , platelet cytoskeletal reorganization is mediated by a system of regula - tory proteins , including the Rho GTPase family members Rho , Cdc42 , and Rac , which have notable roles in regulating platelet function through the control of the actin cytoskeleton ( 1 , 5 , 32 , 39 , 40 ) . The Rho family of small GTP binding proteins , including members RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 , are master organizers of the actin cytoskeleton and direct cell spreading , motility , and growth ( 47 , 48 ) . For the past two decades , these small GTPases have been investigated for separable as well as interdependent functions in ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia formation , membrane rufﬂing , and stress ﬁber formation ( 34 ) . RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 help to orchestrate actin remodeling in a number of cell types , particularly platelets where these proteins converge to regulate platelet activation , secretion , aggregation , and throm - bus stability ( 1 , 32 , 40 , 48 , 55 ) . RhoA and Cdc42 have been shown to have roles in platelet contractility and secretion ( 1 , 40 , 44 , 55 ) . Platelet spreading is driven in part by Rac1 , which is required for platelet lamellipodia formation and to maintain the stability of platelet aggregates ( 7 , 32 ) . While some of the tyrosine kinase signaling events upstream of Rac1 activation in platelet thrombotic functions have been deﬁned , it is not yet well understood how signals downstream of Rac1 are trans - lated into changes in platelet actin structures ( 57 ) . The Rho GTPase family members Cdc42 and Rac promote the autocatalytic activation of the p21 - activated kinases , or PAKs , a family of serine / threonine protein kinases that repre - sent the best characterized Rho GTPase effectors ( 2 ) . PAKs have been shown to localize to actin - rich adhesions and to the leading edge of migrating cells to coordinate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility . Current models of PAK function describe a role for PAK in actin dynamics by way of a network of PAK substrates including ﬁlamin A , RhoGDI , Merlin , and LIMK1 ( 2 ) . Other PAK effectors that also act as small GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) and GEFs , such as GIT and PIX proteins , are also phosphorylated by PAK to subsequently drive the feed - forward activation of Rac1 in a cycle that regulates localized actin assembly and disassembly in pro - cesses of cell spreading and cell motility ( 2 , 21 , 47 ) . Human platelets have been shown to express both group I and II PAKs [ PAK1 and PAK2 , and PAK3 and PAK4 , respectively ( 4 ) ] , with PAK2 being ﬁrst described as a kinase activated upon stimulation of platelets with the protease - activated receptor Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : J .

Previous studies have shown that PAKs and PAK effectors such as LIMK1 are activated in platelets downstream of the collagen receptor GPVI ( 4 ) ; how - ever , a role for PAK in platelet function in response to PAR signaling downstream of thrombin has not yet been deﬁned ( 4 , 13 , 36 , 50 , 55 ) . In this study , a proteomic analysis of Rac1 binding partners reveals that Rac1 associates with a set of PAK effectors from thrombin - activated platelets , including GIT and PIX proteins and the Rho / Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEFH1 . Through the inhibition of platelet PAK , we show that these Rac - associated PAK effectors as well as LIMK1 and Merlin are phosphorylated upon platelet activation in a PAK - depen - dent manner and that PAK activity is required for the coordi - nation of MAPK , Akt , and calcium signaling upstream of platelet lamellipodia formation , phosphatidylserine exposure , and aggregation by thrombin . These ﬁndings establish a model whereby PAK serves as a central organizer of thrombin sig - naling in platelet physiology . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents .

GIT1 and GIT2 antibodies were from Abgent and the University of California , Davis / National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke / National Institute of Mental Health NeuroMab Facility . The anti - GIT1 pSer517 antibody was prepared as previously described ( 61 ) . Alexa Fluor secondary anti - bodies , phalloidin , and Oregon Green BAPTA1 - AM were from Life Technologies . pGEX - Rac1 plasmids were from Addgene . The D - phenylalanyl - L - prolyl - L - arginine chloromethyl ketone ( PPACK ) anti - coagulant was from Calbiochem . Glutathione - Sepharose 4B was from GE Healthcare Life Sciences . Preparation of human washed platelets . Human venous blood was drawn from healthy donors into sodium citrate and acid / citrate / dextrose as previously described ( 7 , 32 ) . Written informed consent was obtained from study participants , and the protocol was approved by the Oregon Health & Science University Institutional Review Board . Platelet - rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of anti - coagulated blood at 200 g for 10 min . Platelets were further puriﬁed from platelet - rich plasma by centrifugation at 1 , 000 g in the presence of prostacyclin ( 0 . 1 (cid:3) g / ml ) . Puriﬁed platelets were resuspended in modiﬁed HEPES / Tyrode buffer ( 129 mM NaCl , 0 . 34 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 9 mM KCl , 12 mM NaHCO 3 , 20 mM HEPES , 5 mM glucose , and 1 mM MgCl 2 pH 7 . 3 ) containing 0 . 1 (cid:3) g / ml prostacyclin . Platelets were washed once by centrifugation and resuspended in modiﬁed HEPES / Tyrode buffer at indicated concentrations . Protein capture and mass spectrometry . Rac1 - GST fusion proteins were prepared and conjugated to glutathione - Sepharose as previously described ( 6 – 8 ) . Immobilized GST - Rac1 proteins were ﬁrst loaded with 50 (cid:3) M nucleotide ( none , GDP , or GTP (cid:4) S ) in TENS buffer ( 10 mM Tris·HCl pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM dithiothreitol ) for 1 h and then incubated on a rotator fo r 1 h at 4°C with precleared lysates from resting or thrombin - activated platelets . The immobilized Rac1 and platelet lysate mixtures were then washed in 10 volumes of buffer A ( 20 mM Tris·HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 50 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and protease inhibitor cocktail ) . The GST - Rac1 afﬁnity bound proteins from activated plate - let lysates were separated by SDS - PAGE , and gel slabs corresponding to 75 – 250 kDa were cut out , digested with trypsin , and recovered peptides analyzed by liquid chromatography / tandem mass spectrom - etry as previously described ( 58 ) using an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , San Jose , CA ) . Tandem mass spec - tral data were then interpreted using the program Sequest ( Version 27 , rev . 12 ; Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and a human protein database containing 13 , 748 entries obtained from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics ( Geneva , Switzerland ) . A static modiﬁcation of 57 mass units was applied to cysteine residues , since proteins were alkylated with iodo - acetamide before trypsinization , and a differential modiﬁcation of 16 mass units to methionine residues to identify peptides undergoing oxidation during processing . Peptides and protein identiﬁcations were assembled and validated using the program Scaffold ( Version 3 . 12 ; Proteome Software , Portland , OR ) , requiring two unique peptide identiﬁcations per protein , and minimum peptide and protein proba - bilities of 90 and 99 % , respectively ( 25 , 33 ) . Western blotting . Western blot experiments were carried out as previously described ( 7 ) . Brieﬂy , platelet solutions were denatured in an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) with 0 . 5 M dithiothreitol ( 100°C , 5 min ) , separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes , and blotted with indicated antibodies and horseradish peroxidase - conjugated second - ary antibodies as previously described ( 7 ) . Protein was detected using ECL ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Static adhesion assays . For platelet spreading experiments , glass coverslips were coated with bovine thrombin ( 50 (cid:3) g / ml ) or human ﬁbrinogen ( 50 (cid:3) g / ml ) followed by surface blocking with BSA ( 5 mg / ml ) . Inhibitors or vehicle were added to platelets in solution ( 2 (cid:5) 10 7 / ml ) at the indicated concentrations for 10 min before exposure to immobilized surfaces at 37°C . After 45 min , nonadherent platelets were discarded and surface - bound platelets were washed three times with PBS . Coverslips were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS . To examine platelet morphology in solution , platelets ( 4 (cid:5) 10 7 / ml ) we ﬁxed with an equal volume of 8 % paraformaldehyde before attachment to poly - L - lysine coated coverglass . Platelets were imaged using Kohler illuminated Nomarski differential interference contrast ( DIC ) optics with a Zeiss (cid:5) 63 oil immersion 1 . 40 - NA plan - apochromat lens on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope as previously described ( 3 , 7 ) . For annexin V binding experiments , platelets were prepared as described above without ﬁxation and incubated with annexin before visualization by ﬂuorescence micros - copy . Calcium imaging . For single - platelet calcium analyses , platelets were loaded with 15 (cid:3) M Oregon Green BAPTA1 - AM as previously described ( 22 ) . Loaded platelets were allowed to settle onto ﬁbrino - gen - coated coverslips over a period of 30 min at 37°C in the presence or absence of 1 U / ml thrombin . The ﬂuorescence intensities of single platelets were recorded and analyzed with a customized Matlab application as previously described ( 22 ) . For comparison purposes , the average max - to - mean ratio (cid:6) SE of ﬂuorescence intensities for at least ﬁve platelets from three ﬁelds of view was calculated for each treatment . Fluorescence microscopy . Puriﬁed human platelets ( 5 (cid:5) 10 6 / ml ) were spread on coverglass coated with 50 (cid:3) g / ml thrombin for 45 min at 37°C . Adherent platelets were washed three times with PBS before ﬁxation with 4 % paraformaldehyde and then washed in PBS and permeabilized with blocking buffer ( PBS , 0 . 1 % SDS (cid:7) 1 % BSA ) for 1 h . Platelets were stained with anti - PAK ( 1 : 50 ) , anti - Rac1 ( 1 : 100 ) , or anti - vinculin ( 1 : 100 ) in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C .

Coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount G ( Southern Biotech ) on glass slides and visualized with a Deltavision CoreDV Wideﬁeld Deconvolution System or a Zeiss Elyra SR - SIM Super - Resolution Structured Illumination Microscope ( 4 ) . Platelet aggregation . For platelet aggregation studies , 300 (cid:3) l of puriﬁed human platelets ( 2 (cid:5) 10 8 / ml ) were pretreated with inhibitors for 10 min as indicated . Platelet aggregation was triggered by 0 . 07 U / ml thrombin and monitored under continuous stirring at 1 , 200 rpm at 37°C by measuring changes in light transmission using a PAP - 4 aggregometer as previously described ( 7 , 32 ) . RESULTS Rac1 associates with a set of PAK effectors from thrombin - activated platelets . We previously determined that the Rho GTPase family member Rac1 is required for platelet lamelli - podia formation and spreading as well as the maintenance of thrombus stability under physiological conditions of shear ( 7 , 32 ) . To better understand how signals from Rac1 lead to changes in platelet actin structures and morphology upon activation , we captured and identiﬁed Rac1 - associated proteins from lysates of thrombin - activated platelets . Rac1 - GST was con - jugated to glutathione Sepharose , loaded with GDP , GTP (cid:4) S , or no nucleotide and incubated with centrifugally cleared lysates of thrombin - activated platelets . As seen in Fig . 1 A , immobilized Rac1 captured a number of platelet proteins as determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining of Rac1 eluates . To identify these Rac - associated proteins , slabs of individual gel lanes in the range of 70 – 250 kDa from Rac1 elutes in the nucleotide free , GDP - loaded , and GTP - loaded states were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptide fragments were identiﬁed by mass spectrometry . As shown in Table 1 , Rac1 captured proteins with putative roles in platelet function , including the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 ( 6 , 38 , 41 ) . Intriguingly , Rac1 captured a set GAPs and GEFs with known relationships to the PAK system , including GIT1 , GIT2 , (cid:1) PIX , (cid:2) PIX , and GEFH1 ( 21 , 47 , 60 ) . Western blot analysis conﬁrmed that GTP (cid:4) S - loaded Rac1 - GST cap - tured GIT1 , GIT2 , (cid:1) PIX , and (cid:2) PIX ( Fig . 1 B ) from thrombin - activated platelets , while minimal amounts of these proteins were associated with unloaded or GDP - loaded Rac1 . More - over , mass spectrometry and protein capture experiments using lysates of thrombin - stimulated platelets revealed that GDP - loaded as well as GTP (cid:4) S - loaded Rac1 associated with the PAK - interacting Rho / Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEFH1 ( Fig . 1 and Table 1 ) . Previous studies have reported that Rac1 and PAK are activated in platelets upon stimulation with thrombin ( 1 , 13 , 50 ) ; however , it is not clear how Rac1 activation relates to PAK activation in thrombin - stimulated platelets . To determine the roles of Rho family GTPases in platelet PAK activation by thrombin , we examined the autocatalytic phosphorylation of PAK and the phosphorylation of the PAK substrate GIT1 in the absence and presence of Rho GTPase signaling pathway inhibitors . Western blot analysis of lysates from thrombin - stimulated platelets demonstrated that thrombin induces the autocatalytic activa - tion and phosphorylation of PAK2 Ser192 well as the PAK - mediated phosphorylation of GIT1 Ser517 ( Fig . 2 A ; Ref . 61 ) . Treatment of platelets with the Rac - speciﬁc inhibitor EHT 1864 abrogated PAK activation and GIT1 phosphorylation elicited by thrombin . Inhibition of RhoA signaling with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 had no effect on thrombin - elicited PAK activation . These results support a role for Rac in thrombin - mediated PAK activation . PAK mediates platelet activation by thrombin . Next , to determine the role of PAK in thrombin - stimulated platelets , we conducted a number of cell signaling studies using a speciﬁc inhibitor of PAK activation , IPA - 3 . This allosteric PAK inhib - itor prevents activation of PAK by Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac ( 14 , 54 ) . IPA - 3 covalently binds to PAK proteins to inhibit the activation of PAKs by the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 ( 14 , 54 ) . In studies of PAK function in contexts of molecular oncology and neuroscience , IPA - 3 has been used in the range of 5 to 25 (cid:3) M to inhibit PAK activity in epithelial cells and neurons ( 19 , 24 , 28 , 35 ) . In the current study , treatment of platelets with 1 U / ml thrombin readily activated PAK2 , as evidenced by the autophosphorylation of PAK2 Ser20 , Ser192 , and Thr402 ( Fig . 2 B ) . As seen in Fig . 2 B , PAK2 phosphorylation in response to thrombin was completely in - hibited following a 10 - min preincubation with 10 (cid:3) M IPA - 3 . These experiments were complimented by the use of an inac - tive PAK inhibitor relative compound , PIR 3 . 5 , which had no effect on thrombin - stimulated platelet PAK2 phosphorylation ( Fig . 2 B ) . Upon treatment with thrombin , platelets undergo a charac - teristic change in morphology from discs to smaller spheres Table 1 .

C521 PAK SYSTEM CONNECTS RAC TO PLATELET ACTIVATION AJP - Cell Physiol • doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpcell . 00418 . 2012 • www . ajpcell . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on O c t obe r 2 9 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p c e ll . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m with ﬁlopodial extensions . To study the function of PAK in this shape change in solution , platelets were preincubated with IPA - 3 for 10 min before the addition of thrombin for 5 min , ﬁxed and bound to a surface of poly - L - lysine , and examined by Kohler - illuminated Nomarski DIC microscopy . As seen in Fig . 2 C , treatment of platelets in solution with 1 U / ml thrombin led to a change in shape from a disc - like morphology to a small spherical shape indicative of platelet activation . Pretreatment of platelets with 10 (cid:3) M IPA - 3 altered this morphological change and led to the formation of extended ﬁlopodial struc - tures . To quantify the effect of PAK inhibition on ﬁlopodia formation , we measured the ﬁlopodia length of 600 platelets per treatment condition . As plotted in Fig . 2 D , the stimulation of platelets with thrombin reduced the mean ﬁlopodial length of platelets from 2 . 07 (cid:6) 1 . 92 to 0 . 96 (cid:6) 1 . 02 (cid:3) m . The mean ﬁlopodial length of platelets treated with thrombin signiﬁcantly increased to 3 . 11 (cid:6) 2 . 54 (cid:3) m under conditions where PAK was inhibited with IPA - 3 . The ability of thrombin to cause a reduction in ﬁlopodial length was unaffected by the presence of PIR 3 . 5 ( 1 . 18 (cid:6) 1 . 36 (cid:3) m ) . Thrombin triggers PAK - dependent phosphorylation of PAK effectors in platelets . In nucleated cells , PAK mediates cell motility , migration , and functions associated with cell growth through the phosphoryation and activation of a complex set of PAK effector proteins , including GAP and GEF proteins cap - tured in our proteomic screen from thrombin - stimulated plate - lets ( Fig . 1 ) . These effectors include GIT1 , PIX , and GEFH1 ( 42 , 60 , 61 ) , as well as classical effectors of PAK function such as LIMK1 , Merlin , and ﬁlamin A ( FLNA ; Ref . 2 ) . To ﬁrst determine whether Rac - associated PAK effectors in thrombin - activated platelets are phosphorylated by PAK , platelets were preincubated with vehicle , IPA - 3 , or PIR 3 . 5 . After a 5 - min stimulation with 1 U / ml thrombin , platelets were lysed directly into Laemmli sample buffer and subject to SDS - PAGE and Western blot for GIT1 and GEFH1 phosphorylation . As seen in Fig . 3 A , thrombin treatment resulted in the phosphorylation of GIT1 Ser517 and GEFH1 Ser885 . The phosphorylation of GIT and GEFH1 upon platelet activation with thrombin was depen - dent on PAK kinase activity , as IPA - 3 pretreatment prevented this thrombin - elicited phosphorylation . Thrombin treatment similarly resulted in a PAK - dependent phosphorylation of LIMK1 as well as Merlin . In nucleated cells , PAK phosphor - ylation of FLNA has been reported to control a key step in actin cytoskeletal reorganizations ( 53 ) . Accordingly , we next examined the phosphorylation state of platelet FLNA in re - sponse to thrombin in PAK - inhibited conditions . As seen in Fig . 3 B , platelet FLNA Ser2152 phosphorylation was not affected by thrombin stimulation or inhibition of PAK . In concert with regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics , PAKs are known to trigger the activation of the MAP kinase pathway through the phosphorylation of MEK proteins and the subsequent activation of ERK ( 15 ) . As seen in Fig . 3 C , PAK was found to be required for the complete activation of platelet MEK in response to thrombin stimulation , as IPA - 3 pretreat - ment dramatically reduced MEK and abrogated ERK phos - phorylation in response to thrombin ( Fig . 3 C ) . In addition to their roles in MAPK activation , the PAKs also support the activation of other key signaling systems , including the phos - phatidylinositol 3 - kinase / Akt pathway ( 20 , 31 ) . As seen in Fig . 3 D , PAK activity was required for the complete activation of platelet Akt by thrombin , as IPA - 3 pretreatment blocked Akt Ser473 phosphorylation and the downstream phosphorylation of the Akt substrate GSK3 (cid:1) Ser3 . Pretreatment of platelets with the inactive IPA - 3 relative molecule PIR 3 . 5 had no effect on thrombin - elicited platelet MEK , ERK , or Akt phosphoryla - tion . These results suggest that in platelets PAK also has a Fig . 2 . PAK activation in platelets upon stimulation with thrombin .

A role for PAK in thrombin - stimulated platelet aggregation . To determine if PAK has a role in platelet aggregation by thrombin , the effects of PAK inhibition on platelet aggregation in solution were assayed using a Born aggregometer . This apparatus measures light transmission through a suspension of platelets , with an increase in optical density correlating to platelet sphericity and shape change and a decrease indicative of aggregation . As shown in Fig . 4 , puriﬁed human platelets readily aggregated in solution upon the addition of 0 . 07 U / ml thrombin . Pretreatment of platelets with IPA - 3 dose depend - ently prevented the aggregation of platelets stimulated with thrombin compared with vehicle alone ( 0 . 1 % DMSO ; Fig . 4 ) . Platelet aggregation in response to thrombin stimulation was minimally effected by 10 (cid:3) M PIR 3 . 5 compared with equimo - lar concentrations of IPA - 3 ( Fig . 4 ) . PAK supports platelet lamellipodia formation in response to thrombin . To examine the potential for an actin - localized coordination of PAK and to Rac signaling by thrombin , we next assayed by ﬂuorescence deconvolution microscopy the colocalization of Rac1 , PAK , and actin in platelets adherent to a surface coated with thrombin . Adherent platelets were ﬁxed , permeabilized and stained for PAK , Rac1 and actin . As shown in Fig . 5 A , PAK and Rac1 colocalized with lamellipodial actin in platelets spread on a surface of thrombin , with a high density of these proteins at focal adhesion regions , supporting a spatial role for organization of Rac and PAK pathways in the regula - tion of actin dynamics . Next , to examine the role of PAK inhibition on thrombin - induced lamellipodia formation as well as the formation of actin - rich adhesion structures , platelets ( 2 (cid:5) 10 7 / ml ) pretreated with vehicle , IPA - 3 , or PIR 3 . 5 were incubated upon glass surfaces coated with thrombin and visu - alized by DIC microscopy . As seen in Fig . 5 B , under control and PIR 3 . 5 - treated conditions , platelets readily formed lamel - lipodia and spread out upon a surface of thrombin . Inhibition of PAK activation by IPA - 3 dose dependently prevented lamel - lipodia formation and platelet spreading , suggesting that focal adhesion formation was similarly disrupted . To examine the architecture of platelet actin - rich adhesions , platelets spread on a surface of thrombin were ﬁxed and stained for actin and as well as vinculin , a key component of focal adhesion structures ( 34 ) . Super - resolution visualization by structured illumina - tion microscopy revealed that platelets readily form actin - rich focal adhesions as they spread on thrombin - coated substrates . The pretreatment of platelets with IPA - 3 before thrombin exposure prevented spreading , focal adhesion for - mation , and the efﬁciency of vinculin association with the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 5 C ) . Signaling networks such as the mammalian target of rapa - mycin ( 7 ) , small GTPase ( 32 ) , and phosphatidylinositol 3 - ki - nase / Akt ( 11 ) systems are required to maintain platelet spread - ing . Given the role of PAK in platelet lamellipodia formation , we hypothesized that PAK would similarly be required for platelet lamellipodia maintenance . To examine if continuous PAK activation is required to maintain platelet lamellipodial structures , puriﬁed human platelets were ﬁrst spread on a surface of thrombin . After 30 min , nonadherent platelets were washed away and platelets were exposed to the PAK inhibitor IPA - 3 or vehicle alone for an additional 15 min . DIC micros - copy reveals that DMSO or PIR 3 . 5 treatment did not reverse the spreading of platelets on a surface of thrombin ( Fig . 5 D ) . However , treatment with IPA - 3 led to the withdrawal of platelet lamellipodia ( Fig . 5 D ) . Role of PAK in platelet calcium signaling and procoagulant activity . To examine the roles of PAK in functional events downstream of platelet activation , we next assayed calcium mobilization in single thrombin - stimulated platelets adherent Fig . 3 . Thrombin - elicited PAK , MEK / ERK , and Akt signaling requires PAK . Puriﬁed human platelets were treated with vehicle ( 0 . 1 % DMSO ) , 10 (cid:3) M IPA - 3 , or 10 (cid:3) M PIR 3 . 5 for 10 min before stimulation with thrombin ( 1 U / ml , 5 min ) . Western blot analysis of PAK - dependent phosphorylation of Rac - captured PAK effectors ( A ) and classical PAK effectors ( B ) as well as MEK and ERK ( C ) and Akt ( D ) . Western blot results are representative of 4 separate experiments . Fig . 4 . Inhibition of PAK blocks platelet aggregation by thrombin . Replicate samples of washed human platelets ( 2 (cid:5) 10 8 / ml ) were incubated with vehicle ( DMSO ) or increasing concentrations of IPA - 3 or 10 (cid:3) M PIR 3 . 5 before stimulation with thrombin ( 0 . 07 U / ml ) , and the change in optical density indicative of platelet aggregation was recorded . Results are representative of 4 separate experiments .

As seen in Fig . 6 A , puriﬁed human platelets readily adhered to and spread on a surface of ﬁbrin - ogen . Pretreatment of platelets with IPA - 3 prevented platelet spreading on ﬁbrinogen in both the presence and absence of 1 U / ml thrombin in solution . To assay calcium dynamics , plate - lets were loaded with the calcium reporter dye Oregon Green BAPTA 1 - AM prior to exposure to thrombin and / or ﬁbrinogen . As shown in Fig . 6 B , platelets adherent to ﬁbrinogen , in both the absence and presence of thrombin in solution , elicited a sustained , oscillatory calcium response that coincided with lamellipodia formation and platelet spreading . Calcium mobi - lization in platelets on ﬁbrinogen in both the absence and presence of thrombin was inhibited by pretreatment of platelets with the PAK inhibitor IPA - 3 . The max - to - mean ratio of calcium ﬂuorescence intensities of platelets on ﬁbrinogen sig - niﬁcantly decreased from 4 . 0 (cid:6) 0 . 21 to 2 . 6 (cid:6) 0 . 20 in the presence of IPA - 3 . A similar decrease in the calcium ﬂuores - cence intensity max - to - mean ratio was observed in thrombin - stimulated platelets on ﬁbrinogen in the presence of IPA - 3 ( 3 . 8 (cid:6) 0 . 18 vs . 2 . 7 (cid:6) 0 . 13 in the presence of vehicle vs . IPA - 3 , respectively ; means (cid:6) SE ; n (cid:8) 3 ) . A similar level of inhibition was observed in the presence of the calcium chelator BAPTA - AM , with a max - to - mean ratio of 2 . 5 (cid:6) 0 . 24 and 2 . 4 (cid:6) 0 . 15 in the absence and presence of thrombin , respectively . Platelet calcium signaling is intimately linked to the mem - brane translocation and externalization of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , a classical marker of apoptosis induction that also serves a procoagulant role in platelet function ( 27 , 45 ) . As single - platelet calcium mobilization in response to thrombin was abrogated in the presence of IPA - 3 , we hypothesized that inhibition of PAK would also block platelet PS exposure in response to thrombin . To test this , thrombin - stimulated plate - lets were exposed to a surface of immobilized ﬁbrinogen 30 min before staining with the PS marker annexin V - FITC . As shown in Fig . 6 C , a fraction of ﬁbrinogen - bound platelets stained positive with annexin V in the absence of thrombin . Fig . 5 .

Quantiﬁcation of annexin V - positive plate - lets shows that under basal conditions on ﬁbrinogen , 3 . 13 (cid:6) 1 . 83 % of platelets bound annexin V on their surface in the presence of vehicle ( 0 . 1 % DMSO ) . Similar basal levels of annexin V binding were seen for platelets pretreated with IPA - 3 or PIR 3 . 5 ( 2 . 67 (cid:6) 1 . 63 and 2 . 94 (cid:6) 0 . 55 % , respec - tively ) . Upon stimulation with thrombin , 17 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 97 and 19 . 8 (cid:6) 0 . 85 % of platelets bound annexin V in the presence of vehicle and PIR 3 . 5 , respectively . Pretreatment with IPA - 3 signiﬁcantly reduced thrombin - stimulated platelet annexin V binding levels to 8 . 70 (cid:6) 0 . 93 % . Together , these results show that the PAK system is involved in the signaling cascade to drive PS exposure in platelets in response to thrombin stimu - lation ( Fig . 7 ) . DISCUSSION The p21 - activated kinases , or PAKs , are well known for connecting the 21 - kDa Rho GTPase family members Cdc42 and Rac to a number of actin - associated cellular functions ( 2 ) . In this study , through proteomics , signaling , and cell physio - logical studies of platelet biology , we ﬁnd that following stimulation of platelets with thrombin , the PAK signaling system serves roles downstream of Rac1 activation to support activation of MEK / ERK , Akt , and calcium signaling as well as platelet spreading and aggregation . Early experiments of Rho GTPase family signaling in plate - lets suggested that PAK functions primarily downstream of Rac and Cdc42 platelets ( 55 ) . More recently , studies of plate - lets from Cdc42 knockout mice have suggested that Cdc42 plays a role in PAK activation in platelets as well as ﬁlopodia formation , platelet aggregation , and Akt activation ( 1 , 5 , 39 ) . As the roles of Rac and Cdc42 in platelet function become further deﬁned , these Rho family GTPases may similarly converge or separately route through PAK pathways and spe - ciﬁc PAK effectors ( 2 , 5 ) . Future studies that take advantage of knockout mouse models of Rac and Cdc42 will aid in clarify - ing whether Cdc42 and Rac play synergistic roles in mediating mouse platelet activation by thrombin . Notably , such studies will require careful interpretation as mouse platelets have a distinct set of receptors for thrombin ( mouse platelets express PAR3 and PAR4 ; human platelets express PAR1 and PAR4 ) that are cleaved with differing efﬁcacy by thrombin to drive platelet activation ( 12 ) . In this study , we show that Rac and PAK colocalize at focal adhesion and lamellipodial regions in human platelets ( Fig . 5 A ) and that speciﬁc inhibition of Rac blocks the thrombin - induced activation of PAK in human platelets ( Fig . 2 A ) . Using a PAK isoform speciﬁc inhibitor , we show that inhibition of PAK1 / 2 / 3 activity alters platelet ﬁlop - odia and lamellipodia dynamics and prevents platelet spreading on a surface of thrombin ( Figs . 2 and 5 ) . PAK inhibition also prevented platelets from establishing focal adhesions on an immobilized surface of thrombin , as determined by super - resolution ﬂuorescence microscopy characterization of the platelet actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 5 C ) . Our proteomic analysis of Rac1 binding partners from thrombin - activated platelets revealed that Rac1 associates with a set of PAK effectors linked to focal adhesion regulation from thrombin - activated platelets , including GIT and PIX proteins Fig . 6 . PAK is required for platelet calcium signaling .

Intriguingly , PAK2 ( also referred to as (cid:4) - PAK ; Ref . 2 ) , was originally character - ized as a thrombin - activated kinase associated with a thrombin - responsive signaling complex consisting of small GTPases and GTPase activating proteins , or GAPs ( 52 ) . Together with our work herein , this study suggests that a multimember signaling complex consisting of Rac and PAK and regulatory proteins such as GIT , PIX , and GEFH1 may work in concert to mediate thrombin - triggered platelet response . GEFH1 phosphorylation by PAK is hypothesized to coordinate RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 pathways ( 60 ) . In nucleated cells , PAK phosphorylation of GEFH1 helps to drive the localized activation of Rho during cytokinesis ( 10 ) ; however , GEFH1 function has not yet been examined in platelets . GITs are multifunctional scaffolding proteins that serve to target PAKs as well as MAPKs to regions of dynamic actin signaling ( 29 , 59 , 61 ) . GITs are closely associated with the PIX proteins , a set of PAK - interacting GEFs that recruit PAK to Rac1 - and Cdc42 - containing focal adhesion complexes and activate Rac1 locally at focal adhe - sions in a feedback mechanism that negatively regulates focal adhesion complex maturation and promotes cell migration ( 26 , 30 , 51 ) . GIT1 associates with PIX and is tyrosine phosphory - lated in thrombin - activated platelets ( 43 ) ; however , the func - tions of GIT and PIX in platelet biology remain to be deﬁned . In addition to recruiting PAK to focal adhesions , GIT1 and (cid:1) PIX are also PAK substrates ; however , a functional role for GIT / PIX phosphorylation by PAK remains to be examined . Here we show that GIT1 is phosphorylated at a previously characterized PAK phosphorylation site in platelets following activation with thrombin in a Rac - and PAK - dependent manner upstream of platelet lamellipodia formation . These results suggest that GIT as well as GEFH1 phosphorylation may link PAK activity to platelet focal adhesion regulation . In addition to GIT1 and GEFH1 , we also examined the phosphorylation of other PAK target proteins with more estab - lished roles in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . In cancer cells , the NF2 gene product and PAK effector Merlin acts to translate receptor signals into cytoskeletal changes through interactions with a number of signaling systems , including small GTPases , PAKs and MAPKs ( 49 ) . Here we show that platelets express Merlin and that Merlin is phosphorylated in platelets in a PAK - dependent manner upon stimulation with thrombin . While stimulation of platelets with thrombin sets forth the activation of a number of PAK effectors with roles in actin dynamics , not all PAK effectors have apparent roles , as PAK - mediated FLNA phosphorylation remains unaffected by thrombin stimulation under control and PAK - inhibited condi - tions . These results suggest that PAK does not regulate platelet actin dynamics through FLNA phosphorylation under static conditions but do not rule out a role for PAK and FLNA under conditions of physiological shear ( 17 ) . Along these lines , we have recently shown that PAK plays a key role in maintaining platelet aggregate stability on collagen under shear ﬂow ( 4 ) . While PAK phosphorylates an expansive set of targets to mediate cell spreading ( 2 ) , LIMK1 may be the best character - ized PAK substrate in connecting Rho family GTPases and PAK to actin regulation ( 9 ) . Following its phosphorylation by PAK as well as ROCK , LIMK1 phosphorylates and inactivates coﬁlin to increase actin polymerization ( 9 ) . Accordingly , PAK may regulate platelet actin dynamics through the LIMK1 - mediated phosphorylation of coﬁlin . Intriguingly , LIMK1 also contributes to platelet function through glycoprotein Ib - IX - mediated TxA2 synthesis ; however , the roles of PAK phos - phorylation actin - independent processes such as platelet TxA2 synthesis remain to be examined ( 16 , 36 , 37 ) . Together with data demonstrating a role for PAK in thrombin - mediated plate - let activation , these ﬁndings connect platelet Rho GTPase signaling to a system of PAK effectors with central roles in platelet physiological functions , including lamellipodia forma - tion , aggregation , and calcium - mediated phosphatidylserine exposure .
