The Actin Gene Family : Function Follows Isoform Benjamin J . Perrin , and James M . Ervasti Department of Biochemistry , Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota Received 7 July 2010 ; Revised 23 July 2010 ; Accepted 30 July 2010 Monitoring Editor : Makoto Kinoshita Although actin is often thought of as a single protein , in mammals it actually consists of six different isoforms encoded by separate genes . Each isoform is remarkably similar to every other isoform , with only slight varia - tions in amino acid sequence . Nevertheless , recent work indicates that actin isoforms carry out unique cellular functions . Here , we review evidence drawn from local - ization studies , mouse models , and biochemical charac - terization to suggest a model for how in vivo mixing of actin isoforms may inﬂuence cytoskeletal function in cells . V C 2010 Wiley - Liss , Inc . Introduction A ctin is essential for a tremendous range of cell functions . A partial list includes cell division , migration , junction formation , chromatin remodeling , transcriptional regulation , vesicle trafﬁcking , and cell shape regulation . How is it possi - ble that one molecule can accomplish such a large diversity of tasks ? One answer to this mystery is that actin is not a single entity ; rather , actin is composed of several different isoforms . Birds and mammals have six genes , and each enco - des one protein isoform . Four isoforms , a skeletal - actin , a cardiac - actin , a smooth - actin , and c smooth - actin , are expressed primarily in skeletal , cardiac , and smooth muscle . The remaining two isoforms , b cyto - actin and c cyto - actin are ubiq - uitously expressed . All of the isoforms possess very similar amino acid sequences , with no isoform sharing less than 93 % identity with any other isoform . b cyto - Actin and c cyto - actin , which are exactly conserved from birds to mammals , only differ by four biochemically similar residues ( Fig . 1 ) . In an unknown fashion , these family members cooperate to endow the microﬁlament network with diverse properties . Here , we will describe evidence from mouse models support - ing the notion that actin isoforms have specialized cellular functions and discuss possible ways in which actins could exert differential effects in cells . Experimental Evidence for Actin - Isoform Speciﬁc Functions Studies in model organisms including Drosophila [ Wagner et al . , 2002 ] and C . elegans [ MacQueen et al . , 2005 ] have provided a rich source of evidence to suggest that actin iso - forms have both overlapping and unique cellular functions . In mammalian systems , most evidence has come from mouse models where individual actin - isoform knockouts have dis - tinct phenotypes . In addition , transgenic actin expression studies have demonstrated some overlap and some special properties among actin isoforms . Muscle Isoforms All knockout mice reported thus far have distinct phenotypes suggesting that each isoactin has unique and specialized func - tions ( Table I ) . a cardiac - Actin knockout results in lethality during either embryonic or perinatal development with pro - found disorganization of cardiac myoﬁbrils [ Kumar et al . , 1997 ] . a skeletal - Actin knockout mice appear normal at birth but have weak muscles and all die by 9 days of age [ Craw - ford et al . , 2002 ] . a smooth - Actin knockout mice are born at Mendelian ratios and are viable . However , these mice have defects in vascular contractility and blood pressure regulation [ Schildmeyer et al . , 2000 ] . c smooth - Actin knockout mice have not yet been reported . In all of these mouse models , there is compensatory upregu - lation of a subset of the remaining actin isoforms . However , since each muscle actin is highly expressed the total level of actin in knockout muscle cells remains less than in wild type . Therefore , transgenic overexpression of other isoforms may rescue the knockout phenotype and provide a useful measure of overlapping function between the isoforms . Along these lines , c smooth - actin was overexpressed in a cardiac - actin knock - outs [ Kumar et al . , 1997 ] and a cardiac - actin was overexpressed in a skeletal - actin knockouts [ Nowak et al . , 2009 ] . Overexpres - sion of c smooth - actin only partially rescued mice lacking a cardiac - actin . Even when these mice survived to adulthood , their hearts were hypodynamic and hypertrophic , demonstrat - ing that c smooth - actin and a cardiac - actin each make distinct contributions to cardiac cell function [ Kumar et al . , 1997 ] . a cardiac - Actin and a skeletal - actin are 99 % identical and have overlapping expression patterns [ Vandekerckhove et al . , * Address correspondence to : James M .

MINI - REVIEW Cytoskeleton , October 2010 67 : 630 – 634 ( doi : 10 . 1002 / cm . 20475 ) V C 2010 Wiley - Liss , Inc . n 630 1986 ] . These similarities suggest that these isoforms have considerable overlapping functions . Correspondingly , trans - genic expression of a cardiac - actin fully rescued the lethality and muscle performance deﬁcits associated with the loss of a skeletal - actin suggesting a potential treatment for human dis - eases associated with reduced a skeletal - actin [ Nowak et al . , 2009 ] . In contrast , overexpression of c cyto - actin did not rescue lethality due to a skeletal - actin deﬁciency suggesting that muscle and nonmuscle actins are more specialized . Interest - ingly , transgenic expression of c cyto - actin in wild - type mice resulted in the substitution of 40 % of thin ﬁlament a skeletal - actin with c cyto - actin [ Jaeger et al . , 2009 ] . Therefore , muscle cell function depends on muscle - speciﬁc actin isoforms , but can tolerate a surprising amount of contamina - tion by c cyto - actin . Cytoplasmic Isoforms b cyto - Actin and c cyto - actin are nearly identical proteins that differ by only four biochemically similar amino acids , all of which are found in the 10 N - terminal residues ( Fig . 1A ) . Mice homozygous for hypomorphic alleles of Actb die during early development of uncharacterized defects [ Shawlot et al . , 1998 ; Shmerling et al . , 2005 ] . A conditional knockout has been generated , but not yet described ( our unpublished data ) . In contrast to b cyto - actin - deﬁcient mice , whole - body c cyto - actin knockout mice are viable and can survive to adulthood and beyond [ Belyantseva et al . , 2009 ; Bunnell and Ervasti , 2010 ] . Interestingly , these mice are smaller than wild - type or heterozygous littermates from an early developmental stage , but are born at normal Mendelian ratios . c cyto - Actin confers a clear survival advantage as signiﬁcant numbers of newborn Fig . 1 .

Corresponding to decreased animal survival , primary c cyto - actin - deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts cultured from these mice have decreased viability , impaired growth , and increased apoptosis and necrosis . On the other hand , consistent with the viability of Actg1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , c cyto - actin null ﬁbroblasts have normal migration in a scratch wound assay [ Bunnell and Ervasti , 2010 ] . Loss of c cyto - actin has similar consequences for cells in vivo . Sensory hair cells in the inner ear depend on stereocilia formed of b cyto - actin and c cyto - actin for proper function . c cyto - Actin - deﬁcient hair cells develop normally but do not maintain stereocilia during aging , which corresponds to pro - gressive hearing loss and deafness [ Belyantseva et al . , 2009 ] . Similarly , conditional knockout of c cyto - actin in muscle did not have developmental consequences [ Sonnemann et al . , 2006 ] despite in vitro evidence that c cyto - actin is required for sarcomere assembly [ Lloyd et al . , 2004 ] . Instead , mice devel - oped a novel progressive centronuclear myopathy . In all cell types from c cyto - actin knockout mice studied thus far , the total cellular concentration of actin remains constant due to compensatory upregulation of the other actin isoforms [ Belyantseva et al . , 2009 ; Bunnell and Ervasti , 2010 ] . Since the actin concentration remains constant , the observed phe - notypes can be ascribed to changes in the actin composition . Mechanisms of Isoform - Speciﬁc Functions There are two commonly held ideas to explain how different isoactins might perform distinct cellular functions . First , a subset of actin - binding proteins could bind speciﬁcally to a single isoform and require that interaction for its function . Consistent with this idea , several proteins , including coﬁlin [ De La Cruz , 2005 ] , ezrin [ Yao et al . , 1996 ] , l - plastin [ Namba et al . , 1992 ] , b CAP73 [ Shuster et al . , 1996 ] , Thy - mosin b4 [ Weber et al . , 1992 ] , and proﬁlin [ Larsson and Lindberg , 1988 ] have been described that discriminate between muscle and cytoplasmic actin isoforms . In addition , annexin 5a may preferentially bind to c cyto - actin over b cyto - actin [ Tzima et al . , 2000 ; Wagner et al . , 2002 ] . The second idea is that actin isoforms are localized to distinct subcellular regions , perhaps as a result of differential interactions with actin - binding proteins or by a mechanism that targets tran - scripts . Differential localization of actin isoforms has been observed in a variety of cell types , with some discordance between reports as to the precise localization patterns for dif - ferent actins . Distinct Localization Patterns Skeletal muscle provides a seemingly clear example of differ - ential localization of muscle and nonmuscle actin isoforms with a skeletal - actin being conﬁned to the sacromeric thin ﬁla - ments . In contrast , c cyto - actin , which has the best - described localization pattern in muscle , appears to be absent from thin ﬁlaments , but is instead found in other muscle cell structures . c cyto - Actin was initially detected in ﬁlamentous structures surrounding mitochondria and adjacent to the sar - colemma [ Craig and Pardo , 1983 ; Pardo et al . , 1983 ] . Subse - quent reports found that c cyto - actin is the only actin species detected at costameres [ Rybakova et al . , 2000 ] , which are structures found between the sarcolemma and the z - disk [ reviewed in Ervasti , 2003 ] . Other recent studies detected c cyto - actin in costameres as well as in a novel zone adjacent to the z - disk [ Kee et al . , 2004 ] . Finally , different groups have detected c cyto - actin only in z - disks and not in costameres [ Nakata et al . , 2001 ; Papponen et al . , 2009 ] . In other cell types , c cyto - actin seems to be uniformly dis - tributed in all actin - containing structures [ Otey et al . , 1986 ] . In contrast , b cyto - actin seems to have a more polarized distri - bution [ Hoock et al . , 1991 ; Bassell et al . , 1998 ] . The differ - ences between b cyto - actin and c cyto - actin localization may be due to a 54 - nucleotide O´zipcodeO´ sequence found in the 3 0 UTR of b cyto - actin but not c cyto - actin transcripts . The zip - code sequence binds to zipcode - binding protein ( ZBP1 , also known as IMP - 1 ) , which facilitates targeting of the transcript and regulates translation [ reviewed in Condeelis and Singer , 2005 ] . ZPB1 binds numerous different transcripts [ Jonson et al . , 2007 ] , perhaps integrating b cyto - actin into a broader cellular program . ZBP1 - mediated regulation of b cyto - actin has important functional consequences in different cell types . In neurons cultured from X . laevis , growth cones exposed to an attractive cue require targeted b cyto - actin transcripts and newly synthe - sized b cyto - actin protein for normal turning behavior [ Leung et al . , 2006 ; Yao et al . , 2006 ] . b cyto - Actin is enriched com - pared to c cyto - actin on the side of the growth cone exposed to attractant [ Yao et al . , 2006 ] and growth cones fail to turn when neurons are treated with antisense oligos to b cyto - actin [ Leung et al . , 2006 ] . Together , this evidence strongly predicts that b cyto - actin is essential for normal neuronal development . However , this hypothesis has yet to be tested in an intact mammalian system . Zbp1 - mediated targeting of b cyto - actin transcripts appears to be important in other cell types , including ﬁbroblasts and adenocarcinoma cells , because interference with the ZBP1 ac - tivity alters cell morphology and migration [ Kislauskis et al . , 1994 ; Shestakova et al . , 2001 ] . Consistent with targeting of b cyto - actin transcripts , several groups report that b cyto - actin is enriched at the leading edge of cultured ﬁbroblasts and myo - blasts as compared to stress ﬁbers found in the central region of the cell [ Hoock et al . , 1991 ; Hill and Gunning , 1993 ; Kislauskis et al . , 1997 ; Shestakova et al . , 2001 ] . In contrast , c cyto - actin appears to be uniformly distributed in all actin - containing structures in ﬁbroblasts [ Otey et al . , 1986 ] . In a conﬂicting report , recent work using newly generated isoform - speciﬁc antibodies and a different ﬁxation technique suggests that b cyto - actin predominates in stress ﬁbers while c cyto - actin is enriched at the leading edge [ Dugina et al . , 2009 ] . Discrepancies in b cyto and c cyto - actin localization have also been noted in auditory hair cell stereocilia . Here , immu - noﬂuorescent labeling indicated that c cyto - actin was localized n 632 Perrin and Ervasti CYTOSKELETON at the periphery of stereocilia [ Belyantseva et al . , 2009 ] , while a study using immuno - TEM found that b cyto - actin was peripheral and c cyto - actin was more centrally localized [ Furness et al . , 2005 ] . Study - to - study differences in observations of cytoplasmic actin localization in cultured cells , stereocilia , and muscle indicate that actin localization presents a formidable chal - lenge . The slight amino acid sequence differences between isoforms require establishing antibody speciﬁcity , ideally using knockout tissue . Importantly , antibody binding interac - tions vary with experimental conditions ; for example , the speciﬁcity of the anti - a cardiac - actin antibody depends on the salt concentration [ Franke et al . , 1996 ] . Even with validated antibodies , it is difﬁcult to interpret cases where there is a lack of staining ( i . e . , costameres , the central regions of ster - eocilia , stress ﬁbers ) because it seems that some actin - based structures may be inherently difﬁcult to immunostain . Tightly bundled actin ﬁlaments , such as those found in ster - eocilia and stress ﬁbers , may resist staining due to epitope masking or limited antibody penetration . Other actin - based structures , such as costameres , are labile and easily lost dur - ing ﬁxation . Actin as an Alloy Differential localization as a mechanism to explain the dis - tinct functions of actin isoforms is an attractive hypothesis because of its intuitive simplicity . However , it remains unclear how relative enrichment leads to changes in actin function . New biochemical evidence suggests that F - actin properties may vary according to the mix of isoforms in the ﬁlament . Bergeron et al . [ 2010 ] recently characterized puri - ﬁed b cyto and c cyto - actin produced in a recombinant baculo - virus system . They observed that under calcium - bound conditions , b cyto - actin exhibited more dynamic behavior than c cyto - actin with faster polymerization and depolymerization rates . Intriguingly , biochemical assays demonstrated that b cyto and c cyto - actin readily copolymerize and that the resulting ﬁl - aments have polymerization and depolymerization rates that vary according to the ratio of b cyto - actin to c cyto - actin [ Ber - geron et al . , 2010 ] . In addition to polymerization dynamics , different mixtures of actin isoforms may well have distinct biophysical properties or distinct interactions with stability regulators such as AIP1 or coﬁlin . Varying the mixture of actin may be a useful mechanism for adapting the cytoskeleton for a variety of functions . By way of analogy , steel is an alloy composed of numerous dif - ferent metals . The ratio of each component determines the characteristics of the particular kind of steel , which is engi - neered to meet the desired compromises between properties such as weight , tensile strength , and cost . It is important that alloys can be manipulated because innumerable different steels are required to meet the varied demands of buildings and machines . Actin is cellular steel . Altering the ratio of actin isoforms within a ﬁlament may tune its properties to meet the speciﬁc requirements of different cells or subcellular structures .
