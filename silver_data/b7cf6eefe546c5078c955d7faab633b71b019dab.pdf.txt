Cofilin - actin ( closed circles ) , control actin ( open circles ) and control actin in the presence of cofilin ( open triangles ) were individually polymerized by the addition of concentrated salts at pH 6 . 5 and at 22 o C . Final reaction mixture contained 1 . 5 µ M actin or cofilin actin , 3 µ M cofilin ( open triangles only ) , 50 mM KCl , 15 mM Pipes pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP and 0 . 5 mM DTT , and polymerization was monitored by the increase of light scattering at 360 nm . Samples containing cofilin - actin scattered light more intensely than control actin homopolymers , which is presumably in part due to the increased thickness of the filaments .

Cofilin moiety in the fusion protein has severing and depolymerization activities . ( A ) Depolymerization of copolymer , control actin homopolymer in the absence of cofilin , and control actin homopolymer in the presence of 4 µ M cofilin . Dictyostelium actin ( 10 µ M ) , or a mixture of 10 µ M actin and 10 µ M cofilin - actin fusion protein , were polymerized in buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 2 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 4 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 1 mM DTT ) at 22 o C for 30 min , and then concentrated Pipes pH 6 . 5 was added ( final 10 mM ) . After 60 min of incubation , an equal volume of 40 mM Pipes buffer ( pH6 . 5 ) or 40 mM Hepes buffer ( pH8 . 3 ) was then added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature . Those samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation ( 250 , 000 x g for 10 min at 22 o C ) followed by SDS - PAGE of supernatant and pellet fractions . In the case of copolymers , incubation at pH 8 . 3 increased the amount of the fusion protein in the sup , but that of control actin was unaffected . This is in contrast to the case of control actin with added cofilin , and is presumably because control actin was able to repolymerize in the absence of cofilin . ( B ) Electron micrographs of negatively stained copolymers at pH 6 . 5 . Some copolymer filaments showed discontinuities , but the similar gaps were not observed in the control actin homopolymers .
