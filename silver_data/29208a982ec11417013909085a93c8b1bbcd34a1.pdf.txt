The early detection 14 and treatment of M . ulcerans infections can significantly minimize life - long disability resulting 15 from surgical intervention . However , the disease is characterized by relatively few systemic 16 systems as a result of complex host - pathogen interactions that have yet to be fully character - 17 ized , which has limited the development of both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to treat 18 BU . In this work , we study the interactions of the host immune system with two principle M . 19 ulcerans virulence factors : mycolactone , an amphiphilic macrolide toxin , and 20 lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) , a cell wall component of most mycobacterial pathogens . We ob - 21 serve that human lipoproteins have a profound effect on the interaction of both mycolactone 22 and LAM with the immune system . Individually , both molecules are pro - inflammatory in the 23 absence of serum and immunosuppressive in the presence of serum . When combined , 24 mycolactone and LAM are immunosuppressive regardless of serum conditions . We also show 25 that Toll - like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) , a macrophage pathogen pattern recognition receptor , is crit - 26 ical for LAM immune stimulation but aids in mycolactone immunosuppression . These findings 27 are a first step towards unraveling mycolactone - mediated immunosuppression during BU 28 2 disease and may facilitate the development of effective diagnostics and therapeutics in the 29 future . 30 Author Summary 31 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium 32 ulcerans . The principal virulence factors associated with it are the macrolide toxin 33 mycolactone and the major cell wall component lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) . Here , we 34 examine the impact of the amphiphilic biochemistry of mycolactone and LAM on their 35 interaction with the human immune system . We show that both mycolactone and LAM 36 associate with serum lipoproteins , and that this association is critical for the immune evasion 37 seen in early - stage M . ulcerans infections . In the absence of serum , mycolactone is 38 pro - inflammatory . Immunosuppression occurs only in the presence of human serum 39 lipoproteins . In the presence of LAM , mycolactone is immunosuppressive , regardless of 40 serum conditions . Immunosuppression is a hallmark of BU disease , and understanding the 41 mechanisms of this immunosuppression can support the development of effective diagnostic 42 and therapeutic strategies . 43 44 3 1 . Introduction 45 Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium 46 ulcerans and is characterized by painless skin lesions . The disease is particularly challenging to 47 detect in early stages , since early symptoms are essentially non - existent and pain develops only 48 later in infection ( 1 - 3 ) . As a result , there has been a recent increase in BU cases in several areas , 49 including Australia and Nigeria ( 4 , 5 ) . However , timeliness of therapeutic intervention can 50 help to decrease the severity of the disease , since early stages of BU can be treated with anti - 51 biotics , but advanced stages require surgery and antibiotic therapy in a hospital ( 6 - 8 ) . 52 The principal virulence factors associated with M . ulcerans are mycolactone , a secreted 53 macrolide toxin , and lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) , a major cell wall component common to 54 mycobacteria ( 2 , 9 , 10 ) . Both virulence factors are amphiphilic , containing hydrophobic and 55 hydrophilic moieties ( 11 , 12 ) , with a wide range of effects including cytotoxicity ( 13 - 15 ) and 56 immunomodulation ( 10 , 16 , 17 ) . Mycolactone’s immunosuppressive nature has led to the 57 understanding that it is responsible for the painlessness of skin lesions in BU ; however , recent 58 findings have suggested that the course of disease is more complicated than originally pro - 59 posed , and that the toxin demonstrates pro - inflammatory potential in later stages of infection 60 ( 18 ) . Similarly , the amphiphilic lipoglycan mannose - capped LAM , produced by pathogenic 61 mycobacterial species , plays an important role in modulating key aspects of the host innate and 62 adaptive immune responses ( 9 ) . Both molecules are generally considered promising diagnostic 63 biomarkers ; mycolactone has been detected in blood prior to the onset of major symptoms of 64 BU ( 19 - 21 ) , and assays have been extensively developed for the detection of LAM in blood 65 and urine , although these tests have low reported sensitivity ( especially in patients living with 66 comorbidities such as HIV ) ( 22 - 25 ) . The amphiphilic biochemistry of LAM and mycolactone 67 makes them particularly challenging targets for diagnostics and therapeutics . In blood , these 68 biomarkers associate with host lipoproteins , including high - and low - density lipoproteins 69 4 ( HDL and LDL ) ( 12 , 26 - 30 ) , which limits the effectiveness of immunoassays targeting 70 amphiphilic virulence factors . The interaction with human lipoproteins may also play an im - 71 portant role in mediating the immune response of the host during infection . The impact of both 72 toxins’ amphiphilic biochemistry on their interaction with the host immune system has yet to 73 be studied in depth . 74 The innate immune system has mechanisms for detecting pathogens using pattern 75 recognition receptors ( PRRs ) against pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) ( 31 ) . 76 PAMPs are conserved microbial virulence factors that are easily recognized by immune cell 77 receptors , such as the Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) ( 32 ) . PAMPs are promising targets for both 78 detection and anti - bacterial therapeutic strategies . Both LAM and mycolactone are recognized 79 by multiple PRRs , including Toll - like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) , which is primarily expressed on the 80 surface of macrophages and dendritic cells during early infection ( 18 , 33 , 34 ) . In the case of 81 LAM , binding with immune receptors subsequently triggers the MyD88 - dependent signaling 82 pathway , leading to the production of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines ( 35 , 36 ) . 83 Mycolactone has been shown to have opposing effects on the host immune system in early 84 versus late stages of infection . In early infection , mycolactone targets the Sec61 channel to 85 inhibit cytokine production and suppress the immune response ( 37 - 39 ) . More recently , it has 86 been shown that in later stages of infection , mycolactone induces the production of interleu - 87 kin - 1 β ( IL - 1 β ) , a pro - inflammatory cytokine , in a TLR2 - dependent mechanism ( 18 ) . 88 Mycolactone displays additional modes of action that cause cell damage and death , including 89 binding to the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome proteins to cause uncontrolled actin polymerization , 90 and interaction with the pro - apoptotic regulator Bim ( 2 , 40 - 42 ) . 91 There have been inconsistent analyses on both LAM ( 35 , 43 - 45 ) and mycolactone ( 18 , 92 46 - 48 ) that suggest seemingly contradictory immune responses . The inconsistencies found 93 could be due to the differential interaction of LAM and mycolactone with host lipoproteins , 94 5 thereby making it difficult to interpret the biological significance of the findings . In this work , 95 we investigate the binding of both LAM and mycolactone to serum lipoproteins , the implica - 96 tions these interactions have on the pathophysiology of BU , and the effect of this interaction on 97 the nature of the host immune response . 98 2 . Materials and Methods 99 2 . 1 . Reagents and Materials 100 Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline ( PBS , D8662 ) was obtained from Millipore Sigma 101 ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Synthetic mycolactone A / B stocks were a kind gift from the World 102 Health Organization ( Geneva , Switzerland ) at 0 . 1 mg / mL in ethanol and stored at – 20 °C 103 protected from light until use ( 49 ) . Purified lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ; Mycobacterium tu - 104 berculosis , strain H37Rv , NR - 14848 ) was obtained through BEI Resources ( NIAID , NIH ) . 105 LAM was resuspended at 1 mg / mL in sterile nanopure water ( Direct - Q 3 UV - R , Millipore 106 Sigma ) . 60 - µL aliquots were stored in low - retention tubes at – 80 °C and thawed immediately 107 prior to use . 1 - mL aliquots of control human serum ( BP2657100 , Fisher Scientific , Hampton , 108 NH , USA ) were stored at −20 °C and thawed only once prior to use . 1 - mL aliquots of 109 de - lipidated human serum ( J65516 , BT - 931 , Alfa Aesar , Haverhill , MA , USA ) were stored at 110 −20 °C and thawed only once prior to use . Human high - density lipoproteins ( HDL , L8039 ) , 111 low - density lipoproteins ( LDL , L7914 ) , very low - density lipoproteins ( VLDL , LP1 ) , and 112 chylomicrons ( CM , SRP6304 ) were purchased from Millipore Sigma and stored at 4 °C . 113 Siliconized low - retention plastic microfuge tubes were used to store samples ( 02 - 681 - 320 , 114 Fisher Scientific ) . 115 2 . 2 . Mycolactone - lipoprotein UV - vis Experiments 116 As described previously ( 12 ) , mycolactone association with lipoproteins was quantified 117 by UV - vis spectrophotometry ( λ max = 362 nm ; log ε = 4 . 29 ) . 1 µL of 100 µg / mL mycolactone 118 6 A / B was added to 9 µL of lipoprotein solutions diluted in PBS ( 0 , 0 . 125 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , or 0 . 75 119 mg / mL ) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow for mycolactone - lipoprotein 120 association . UV - vis absorbance measurements were taken at 362 nm using 2 µL of each solu - 121 tion on a NanoDrop One C ( ND - ONEC - W , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Measurements were 122 taken three times ( technical replicates ) and each experiment was repeated three times ( bio - 123 logical replicates ) for a total of nine absorbance measurements per lipoprotein concentration . 124 Each lipoprotein concentration was measured in the absence of mycolactone and subtracted 125 from the mycolactone measurement . 126 2 . 3 . Tissue Lines and Reagents 127 The human monocyte cell line THP - 1 ( TIB - 202 ) was purchased from the American Type 128 Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) . Human THP - 1 TLR2 ( - / - ) cell line was 129 custom - engineered by Horizon Inspired Cell Solutions ( HD204 - 038 , Horizon Discovery , 130 Waterbeach , UK ) . RPMI - 1640 medium ( 2 mM L - glutamine , 10 mM 131 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 4 . 5 g / L glucose , 132 and 1 . 5 g / L sodium bicarbonate ; 30 - 2001 ) and fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; 30 - 2020 ) were pur - 133 chased from ATCC . 2 - mercaptoethanol ( M6250 ) and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA , 134 P8139 ) were purchased from Millipore Sigma . 135 2 . 4 . THP - 1 Culture 136 THP - 1 cells were revived in a T - 25 Corning cell culture flask ( CLS430639 , Millipore 137 Sigma ) with RPMI - 1640 supplemented with 0 . 05 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and 20 % FBS . Once 138 growth was established , cells were sub - cultured in T - 75 tissue culture flasks with RPMI - 1640 139 supplemented with 0 . 05 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and 20 % FBS . THP - 1 cells double every 140 24 - 48 h and were sub - cultured by addition of fresh growth media before reaching 10 6 cells / mL . 141 2 . 5 . THP - 1 Adaptation to Low - serum Growth Conditions 142 7 Cells were adapted to growth in RPMI - 1640 supplemented with 0 . 05 mM 143 2 - mercaptoethanol containing 2 . 5 % FBS in order assess the effect of adding serum and various 144 lipoproteins on gene expression . Starting with 20 % FBS upon cell revival , at every sub - culture 145 the FBS concentration was reduced by half ( 20 % , 10 % , 5 % , and 2 . 5 % ) . RPMI - 1640 containing 146 0 . 05 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and 2 . 5 % FBS is referred to as low serum media . 147 2 . 6 . Differentiation of THP - 1 Monocytes to Macrophages 148 THP - 1 cells were differentiated to macrophages using phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate 149 ( PMA ) by adapting previously published methods ( 50 - 52 ) . Cells were first adapted to 2 . 5 % 150 FBS as described above , then sub - cultured in growth media containing 20 nM PMA . 1 mL of 8 151 x 10 4 cells / mL was added to each well in a 24 well tissue culture plate ( Corning Costar 152 07 - 200 - 740 , Fisher Scientific ) and incubated in 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C for 24 h , at which point cells 153 become adherent . After 24 h , PMA - containing media was removed , and cells were rinsed twice 154 with growth media . 1 mL of growth media was added to each well and cells were allowed to 155 differentiate for another 48 – 72 h in 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C . Differentiation was confirmed by flow 156 cytometry as described previously ( 50 ) . 157 2 . 7 . LAM and Mycolactone THP - 1 Exposure Experiments 158 LAM and mycolactone were pre - incubated with growth media containing 20 % human 159 serum , 2 . 5 % human serum , 20 % de - lipidated human serum , or human lipoproteins overnight at 160 4 °C to allow time for association . Lipoproteins were used at the following physiologically 161 relevant concentrations : 0 . 5 mg / mL HDL ( 53 ) , 1 mg / mL LDL ( 54 ) , 0 . 15 mg / mL VLDL ( 55 ) , 162 0 . 1 mg / mL CM ( 56 ) . 0 . 5 mL of each solution was added to each well of differentiated THP - 1 163 macrophages and incubated in 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C . After 24 h , the supernatant was removed , and 164 cells were washed once with PBS ( 56064C , Millipore Sigma ) . RNA was extracted for gene 165 expression analysis using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , 74106 ) as per manufacturer instruc - 166 tions . RNA was pooled from at least four wells ( technical replicates ) to obtain enough RNA for 167 8 gene expression analysis . Experiments were repeated at least three times ( biological repli - 168 cates ) . 169 2 . 8 . Gene Expression Analysis by RT - PCR . 170 cDNA synthesis was performed on the extracted RNA using the RT 2 First Strand Kit 171 ( 330404 , Qiagen , Germantown , MD , USA ) . Initial gene expression profiling was performed 172 using the 96 - well Human Cytokines & Chemokines RT 2 Profiler PCR Array ( PAHS - 150ZC , 173 Qiagen ) according to manufacturer instructions . Arrays contained 84 different human cyto - 174 kines and chemokines , five housekeeping genes , and controls to monitor genomic DNA con - 175 tamination , reverse transcription , and PCR efficiency . 96 - well assays were used to down - select 176 18 genes of interest , which were ordered and tested on the remaining samples individually . 177 PCR arrays and assays were run on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus thermocycler 178 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) using RT 2 SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix ( 330529 , Qiagen ) . 179 Individual human RT 2 primer assays and controls ( 330011 ) : bone morphogenetic protein 2 180 ( BMP2 , PPH00549C ) , chemokine ( C - C motif ) ligand 1 ( CCL1 , PPH00701B ) , chemokine 181 ( C - C motif ) ligand 2 ( CCL2 , PPH00192F ) , chemokine ( C - C motif ) ligand 20 ( CCL20 , 182 PPH00564C ) , chemokine ( C - C motif ) ligand 3 ( CCL3 , PPH00566F ) , chemokine ( C - C motif ) 183 ligand 5 ( CCL5 , PPH00703B ) , colony - stimulating factor 2 ( CSF2 , PPH00576C ) , colo - 184 ny - stimulating factor 3 ( CSF3 , PPH00723B ) , chemokine ( C - X - C motif ) ligand 1 ( CXCL1 , 185 PPH00696C ) , chemokine ( C - X - C motif ) ligand 2 ( CXCL2 , PPH00552F ) , chemokine ( C - X - C 186 motif ) ligand 5 ( CXCL5 , PPH00698B ) , chemokine ( C - X - C motif ) ligand 8 ( CXCL8 , 187 PPH00568A ) , interleukin 1 alpha ( IL - 1 α , PPH00690A ) , interleukin 1 beta ( IL - 1 β , 188 PPH00171C ) , interleukin 15 ( IL - 15 , PPH00694B ) , interleukin 16 ( IL - 16 , PPH00586A ) , in - 189 terleukin 18 ( IL - 18 , PPH00580C ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF , PPH00341F ) , actin beta 190 ( ACTB , PPH00073G ) , hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 ( HPRT1 , PPH01018C ) , 191 ribosomal protein large P0 ( RPLP0 , PPH21138F ) , reverse transcription control ( RTC , 192 9 PPX63340A ) , and genomic DNA contamination control ( PA - 031 ) were purchased from 193 Qiagen . All PCR arrays and assays were subject to quality control monitoring for genomic 194 DNA contamination , first strand synthesis ( RTC ) , and real - time PCR efficiency ( PPC , arrays 195 only ) . Data were recorded as threshold cycle ( C T ) . 196 2 . 9 . Data analysis 197 UV - vis data analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism ( v9 . 0 . 1 , GraphPad Software , 198 San Diego , CA , USA ) . One - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) testing was performed to 199 assess differences between groups of data , with Tukey’s multiple comparisons testing per - 200 formed post - hoc if a significant difference ( P < 0 . 05 ) was identified . Gene expression analysis 201 was performed using the Qiagen Gene Globe Data Portal ( http : / / www . qiagen . com / geneglobe ) , 202 by comparing test conditions ( with LAM and / or mycolactone ) to control conditions in the 203 absence of these bacterial virulence factors . C T values were normalized based on manual se - 204 lection ( arithmetic mean ) using the housekeeping genes ACTB , HPRT1 , RPLP0 and fold 205 change / regulation was calculated with P values < 0 . 05 considered significant . Data were vis - 206 ualized with GraphPad Prism . 207 3 . Results and Discussion 208 3 . 1 . Mycolactone Directly Interacts with Serum Lipoproteins 209 Previous work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated a role for human lipo - 210 proteins in trafficking amphiphilic molecules in blood ( 27 , 29 , 57 , 58 ) . The interaction of LAM 211 ( 26 , 27 ) and mycolactone ( 12 ) with HDL and LDL has also been investigated . In this work , we 212 studied the interaction of mycolactone with four major serum lipoproteins : HDL , LDL , VLDL , 213 and CM . We tested each of these lipoproteins’ interaction with mycolactone at physiologically 214 relevant concentrations ( 53 , 54 , 56 , 59 - 61 ) . We have previously described the interaction of 215 LAM with serum lipoproteins ( 62 ) . 216 10 Mycolactone is a small molecule with known low antigenicity ( 40 ) . Because of a lack of 217 available antibodies , reliable immunoassays have not been developed for the detection of 218 mycolactone ( 40 , 63 ) . However , due to its conjugated π system , mycolactone has a UV - vis 219 absorbance at 362 nm , allowing it to be easily measured in a spectrophotometer ( 12 , 64 , 65 ) . To 220 test mycolactone binding to serum lipoproteins , a range of lipoprotein concentrations between 221 0 and 0 . 75 mg / mL were incubated with 10 µg / mL mycolactone for 30 minutes , protected from 222 light . Absorbance was then measured at 362 nm ( Figure 1a - d ) . Background signal , measured 223 as lipoprotein absorbance at 362 nm with no mycolactone , was subtracted from the absorbance 224 measured with mycolactone - containing samples to correct for lipoprotein absorbance and 225 scattering losses . Each serum lipoprotein showed the ability to bind to mycolactone with dif - 226 fering affinity . HDL and VLDL bound mycolactone with high affinity at lipoprotein concen - 227 trations as low as 0 . 125 mg / mL . At the physiologically relevant concentrations of 0 . 5 and 0 . 75 228 mg / mL ( 54 , 61 ) , insignificant but increased binding of mycolactone to LDL was also observed . 229 The results for CM were inconclusive due to high background absorbance at 362 nm of the CM 230 alone ( Table S1 ) . The results of our UV - vis experiments show that mycolactone interacts with 231 native human serum lipoproteins with varying affinities . Understanding the interaction be - 232 tween these M . ulcerans virulence factors and serum lipoproteins is a critical step towards 233 improving the diagnosis and treatment of BU . 234 235 Figure 1 . Mycolactone sequestration by serum lipoproteins . UV - vis absorbance 236 measurements at 362 nm of 10 µg / mL mycolactone incubated with ( a ) HDL , ( b ) LDL , ( c ) 237 VLDL , and ( d ) CM at concentrations from 0 to 0 . 75 mg / mL . Measurements ( n = 9 replicates ) 238 are given as corrected absorbance at 362 nm ( A 362 mycolactone with lipoproteins – A 362 239 lipoproteins alone at each respective concentration ; AU , arbitrary units ) . Statistical 240 significance was determined using a one - way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparisons 241 test performed post - hoc if a significant difference was identified ( * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , * * P < 0 . 01 , 242 * P < 0 . 05 ; ns , not significant ) . Raw data and statistical analysis are provided in Table S1 . 243 3 . 2 . LAM is a Pro - inflammatory Virulence Factor in the Absence of Serum Lipoproteins 244 To examine the effect of individual serum lipoproteins on cytokine expression , THP - 1 245 human macrophages were exposed to various conditions outlined in Figure 2 . 10 µg / mL LAM 246 was presented to THP - 1 cells in culture media containing 1 ) 20 % human serum , 2 ) 20 % 247 de - lipidated human serum ( serum where lipoproteins are removed by centrifugation ) , 3 ) 2 . 5 % 248 human serum , and 4 ) individual human lipoproteins ( HDL , LDL , VLDL , and CM ) . An ex - 249 posure time of 24 hours and LAM concentration of 10 µg / mL were chosen based on the liter - 250 ature ( 44 , 50 - 52 , 66 - 71 ) . For sustained growth in low serum conditions , we developed a pro - 251 tocol to adapt THP - 1 cells to 2 . 5 % serum as described in detail in the Methods section . Prior to 252 LAM exposure , 20 % serum and low serum adapted THP - 1 cells were differentiated using 253 PMA ( 50 - 52 ) . 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 Figure 2 . Overview of macrophage experiments . In these experiments , ( a ) THP - 1 mono - 261 cytes were adapted to growth in low serum conditions and then differentiated to macrophages . 262 ( b ) Next , macrophages growing in low serum were exposed to LAM and mycolactone in the 263 presence and absence of various serum and lipoprotein conditions . Created with 264 BioRender . com . 265 Initially , we examined the impact of LAM on the expression of 84 cytokines and 266 chemokines using a high - throughput reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain re - 267 action ( RT - qPCR ) array ( Figure S1 , Tables S2 and S3 ) . Prior to cell culture , 10 µg / mL of 268 13 LAM was pre - incubated for 24 hours in just two media conditions ( 20 % serum and low ( 2 . 5 % ) 269 serum ) in order to determine a sub - set of cytokines and chemokines that are affected by serum 270 levels . The pre - incubation step allows for the association of LAM with serum lipoproteins 271 prior to exposure to the cells in culture . Cell growth in the absence of LAM was used as a 272 baseline for gene expression . It has been shown in the literature that LAM is an an - 273 ti - inflammatory molecule that inhibits TNF and IL - 12 , while stimulating IL - 10 production 274 ( 72 - 75 ) . However , our results indicate that this response is modulated by the lipoprotein con - 275 centration , suggesting a physiological range of outcomes . Indeed , we observed increased ex - 276 pression of TNF when cells were exposed to LAM in low serum as compared to LAM in the 277 presence of 20 % serum , indicating that the lipoproteins present in serum play a role in LAM’s 278 ability to act as an anti - inflammatory agent . We did not observe changes in IL - 12 and IL - 10 279 between the different conditions . In response to LAM in the low serum condition , we observed 280 high expression of CCL3 , CXCL2 , and CXCL8 that was not observed when lipoproteins in 281 20 % serum were present . LAM in the absence of serum elicits a much greater cytokine and 282 chemokine response compared to LAM in the presence of serum . This data indicates that serum 283 lipoproteins suppress the interaction of LAM with the human immune system . These results 284 were consistent between replicates ( n = 3 ) , and further studies were performed monitoring a 285 subset of genes to validate and delve into this initial observation . 286 3 . 3 . Serum Lipoproteins Suppress the Pro - inflammatory Response Induced by LAM 287 To confirm the finding that the presence of lipoproteins in serum and their association 288 with LAM impacts the cytokine and chemokine profile of human macrophage cells , we eval - 289 uated gene expression in 20 % serum , 2 . 5 % serum , de - lipidated serum , and 2 . 5 % serum con - 290 taining purified human lipoproteins ( HDL , LDL , VLDL and CM ) , as outlined in Figure 2 . 291 LAM was allowed to associate with lipoproteins in the different conditions by pre - incubating 292 overnight before exposure to THP - 1 cells ( Figure 3 ; see Table S5 for significance testing 293 results ) . LAM in de - lipidated serum and LAM in 2 . 5 % serum conditions similarly showed 294 pro - inflammatory responses with induction of CSF2 , CCL3 , CXCL2 and CXCL8 . CCL3 , also 295 known as macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP - 1 α ) , is produced by a variety of cells in - 296 cluding monocytes and macrophages and is involved in the acute inflammatory state ( 76 ) . 297 CXCL2 , also known as MIP - 2 , and CXCL8 , also known as IL - 8 , are associated with neutrophil 298 infiltration in inflammatory diseases and attract macrophages and monocytes ( 77 , 78 ) . LAM in 299 de - lipidated serum also shows an increase in IL - 1 β and TNF , which are chemotactic mediators 300 involved in neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation ( 79 ) . On the other hand , LAM in 301 the presence of any individual lipoprotein shows suppression of this immune response . Inter - 302 estingly , VLDL and CM showed higher suppression of cytokine signaling than HDL and LDL . 303 This trend could be due to the larger particle size of VLDL ( 30 - 90 nm ) and CM ( 200 - 600 nm ) 304 as compared to HDL ( 7 - 13 nm ) and LDL ( 21 - 27 nm ) , which might provide them with greater 305 surface area to associate with LAM ( 80 - 82 ) . Additionally , the different molar concentrations of 306 the various serum lipoproteins used in these experiments ( based on normal physiological 307 concentrations ) could further contribute to the observed differences in cytokine signaling upon 308 exposure to LAM . 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 15 316 317 Figure 3 .

Mycolactone is Pro - inflammatory in the Absence of LAM and Serum Lipoproteins 324 After observing that mycolactone and LAM interact directly with serum lipoproteins , we 325 investigated the effects of both molecules on the cellular immune response by exposing THP - 1 326 cells to 3 ng / mL mycolactone and 10 µg / mL LAM in 20 % serum and low ( 2 . 5 % ) serum con - 327 ditions ( Figure 4 ; see Table S5 for significance testing results ) . 328 329 16 Figure 4 . Immunosuppression occurs when mycolactone and LAM are co - administered . 330 Cytokine profiles of THP - 1 - derived macrophages exposed to 10 µg / mL LAM , 3 ng / mL 331 mycolactone , and both mycolactone and LAM co - administered in ( a ) 20 % serum and ( b ) 2 . 5 % 332 serum conditions . See Tables S4 and S5 for raw C T and Fold Regulation data , respectively . 333 In media containing 20 % serum , effectively no pro - inflammatory activation was ob - 334 served in cells exposed to LAM , mycolactone , or both ( Figure 4a ) . In contrast , in media with 335 2 . 5 % serum , both LAM and mycolactone are pro - inflammatory , suggesting that the lipopro - 336 teins present in serum play an important role in suppressing the immune response of macro - 337 phages exposed to LAM or mycolactone . Interestingly , cells exposed to LAM and 338 mycolactone together displayed little to no cytokine response whether serum was present or 339 not , suggesting that LAM and mycolactone act together to suppress the immune system . 340 3 . 5 . TLR2 Inhibits Mycolactone Stimulation of the Immune System 341 To determine the role of TLR2 in the cellular response to LAM and mycolactone , cyto - 342 kine expression of TLR2 wild - type ( + / + ) cells was compared to TLR2 knockout ( - / - ) cells 343 ( Figure 5 ; see Table S5 for significance testing results ) . TLR2 has been reported as a down - 344 stream effector of both mycolactone ( 18 , 83 ) and LAM ( 33 , 44 , 71 , 84 ) . The presence of 20 % 345 serum suppressed the cytokine response to LAM regardless of TLR2 status ( Figure 5a ) . In the 346 absence of serum and presence of TLR2 , LAM is pro - inflammatory . This response is sup - 347 17 pressed in the absence of TLR2 ( - / - ) , which suggests that LAM signaling is mediated by TLR2 348 as described previously ( 33 , 44 , 71 , 84 ) . In the absence of both TLR2 and serum , LAM exhibits 349 effectively neither pro - nor anti - inflammatory activation , suggesting that TLR2 and serum 350 constituents exclusively mediate LAM - induced immune responses . 351 Figure 5 . TLR2 inhibits mycolactone stimulation of the immune system . Cytokine profiles 352 of THP - 1 - derived macrophages containing wild - type TLR2 ( + / + ) or TLR2 knockout ( - / - ) 353 exposed to ( a ) 10 μ g / mL LAM , ( b ) 3 ng / mL mycolactone , and ( c ) both LAM and mycolactone 354 co - administered . See Tables S4 and S5 for raw C T and Fold Regulation data , respectively . 355 TLR2 plays a different role in the immune response to mycolactone ( Figure 5b ) . In the 356 absence of TLR2 ( - / - ) , mycolactone was pro - inflammatory regardless of whether serum was 357 present or not . Similarly , in the absence of serum , mycolactone was pro - inflammatory re - 358 gardless of whether TLR2 was present or not . Mycolactone only failed to elicit a 359 pro - inflammatory response when both TLR2 and serum were present . These results indicate 360 that mycolactone is pro - inflammatory , but TLR2 and serum together inhibit its stimulation of 361 the immune system . 362 When mycolactone and LAM were co - administered , we observed limited immune re - 363 sponses ( Figure 5c ) . However , gene expression in the TLR2 knockout ( - / - ) cell line was sig - 364 nificantly higher than the gene expression in wild - type TLR2 ( + / + ) in both 2 . 5 % serum ( P < 365 0 . 001 ) and 20 % serum ( P < 0 . 01 ) conditions . These data corroborate our previous finding that 366 TLR2 inhibits mycolactone’s stimulation of the immune system . In the absence of TLR2 ( - / - ) , 367 co - administration of LAM and mycolactone resulted in immune induction , although the effect 368 was reduced when compared to mycolactone alone . This finding indicates that LAM is im - 369 munosuppressive in the absence of TLR2 . Finally , the presence of serum suppresses the im - 370 mune response with and without TLR2 . 371 18 3 . 6 . LAM and Mycolactone May Lead to Pro - inflammatory Activation through HDL 372 Dysfunction and Membrane Disruption 373 The association of LAM and mycolactone with serum lipoproteins provides insights into 374 the pathophysiology of BU . For example , as we noted in the Introduction , mycolactone is 375 thought to be immunosuppressive in the early stages of BU and pro - inflammatory in the late 376 stages of BU ( 18 ) . Our results indicate that the immunosuppressive nature of mycolactone is 377 mediated by serum lipoproteins and TLR2 , likely involving direct association with serum 378 lipoproteins . Notably , serum lipoproteins do not have unlimited capacity for toxins that have 379 been sequestered from the blood , and saturation of lipoproteins with toxins has the potential to 380 change their biological activity . Similar effects have been observed in chronic kidney disease ; 381 saturation of HDL with symmetric dimethylarginine , a circulating kidney biomarker , renders 382 the HDL dysfunctional ( 85 ) . The dysfunctional HDL then initiates TLR2 signaling on endo - 383 thelial cells , leading to a variety of deleterious effects , including hypertension and increased 384 superoxide production ( 86 ) . 385 Therefore , in the early stages of BU , mycolactone could be entirely sequestered by HDL , 386 leading to immunosuppression . But in the later stages of BU , circulating HDL could become 387 saturated with mycolactone , leading to pro - inflammatory activation . It is worth noting that 388 saturated , dysfunctional lipoproteins may not be involved in pro - inflammatory activation in 389 BU , but instead newly produced mycolactone that is unable to be sequestered may begin to 390 circulate at appreciable concentrations in the bloodstream , leading to pro - inflammatory acti - 391 vation by some other mechanism . Similarly , LAM’s TLR2 - dependent immune stimulation , 392 which we observed in the absence of serum lipoproteins , may also exhibit lipoprotein satura - 393 tion behavior . Further biophysical characterization of the interactions between serum lipo - 394 proteins and both LAM and mycolactone will be invaluable in deciphering the interaction of M . 395 ulcerans with the immune system . 396 19 The identities of the upregulated pro - inflammatory cytokines that we measured by 397 RT - qPCR can provide further insight into the specific biochemical pathways activated in BU . 398 Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) , we searched for pathways 399 involving the most significantly upregulated cytokines ( 87 - 89 ) . We noticed that a handful of 400 our most significantly upregulated cytokines ( TNF , IL - 1 β , CSF2 , and IL - 8 ) were noted as 401 downstream of membrane disruption in shigellosis through the NF - κβ signaling pathway 402 ( KEGG : map05131 ) ( 87 - 89 ) . Given the amphiphilic natures of LAM and mycolactone , 403 membrane disruption provides a plausible mechanistic basis for immune stimulation in 404 late - stage BU . 405 4 . Conclusions 406 In this manuscript we have identified an important relationship between the immuno - 407 suppressive effects of mycolactone and LAM and the presence of serum lipoproteins . The 408 absence of serum results in a cytokine response from macrophages exposed to either virulence 409 factor . This response indicates that amphiphilic PAMPs avoid immune stimulation by associ - 410 ating themselves with lipoproteins found in serum . We additionally showed that both LAM 411 ( 62 ) and mycolactone can interact with any of the four major serum lipoprotein classes , indi - 412 cating that this association is nonspecific and likely due to a combination of hydrophobic and 413 hydrophilic interactions . Interestingly , the presence of both molecules is immunosuppressive 414 with or without serum , indicating that the two molecules inhibit macrophages along different , 415 but not unrelated , pathways . Understanding the interplay between these molecules and serum 416 lipoproteins will be integral to improving the diagnosis and treatment of Mycobacte - 417 rium - associated illness , including BU . Based on these findings , another implication to consider 418 is that human lipoprotein concentrations are impacted by a variety of metabolic and physio - 419 logical processes such as age , diet , co - morbidities ( obesity , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular dis - 420 20 ease , diabetes ) , and co - infections ( HIV , malaria ) ( 90 - 94 ) . Thus , the susceptibility of a given 421 individual to BU is a complex interplay of the pathogen with host health and physiology . 422 We have also investigated the interaction between mycolactone , LAM , and TLR2 . When 423 TLR2 was knocked out , mycolactone induced an immune response in macrophages regardless 424 of the presence or absence of serum . This response indicates that TLR2 plays an inhibitory role 425 in mycolactone immune stimulation . In the presence of both LAM and mycolactone , as during 426 an M . ulcerans infection , TLR2 knockout induces a small but significant cytokine response . 427 LAM dampens the mycolactone - dependent immune stimulation that occurs in the absence of 428 TLR2 , suggesting that LAM and mycolactone each play immunosuppressive roles during in - 429 fection . 430 Many bacterial PAMPs are amphiphilic and are transported within the body by host 431 lipoproteins . These lipoprotein interactions help the amphiphilic PAMPs escape detection by 432 the immune cells of the host . Here , we have examined the potential of both LAM and 433 mycolactone to directly interact with human lipoproteins , as well as the effect this interaction 434 has on immune signaling . We have also characterized mycolactone and LAM’s interactions 435 with TLR2 , including that mycolactone acts with TLR2 in an immunosuppressive fashion . As 436 they are prominent molecules in the pathogenesis of BU , a better understanding of the activities 437 of both LAM and mycolactone will remain important in designing more effective diagnostic 438 and therapeutic strategies . 439 21 Supplementary Materials : The following supporting information is available ; Table S1 : 440 Raw UV - vis data and statistical analysis of mycolactone interaction with human lipoproteins ; 441 Table S2 : Raw RT - PCR CT values from 96 - well human cytokine and chemokine arrays for 442 THP - 1 experiments with LAM .
