In this work , we systematically explore domain - adaptive training to reduce the toxicity of language models . We conduct this study on three dimensions : training corpus , model size , and parameter efﬁciency . For the training corpus , we demonstrate that using self - generated datasets consistently outperforms the existing baselines across various model sizes on both automatic and human evaluations , even when it uses a 13 smaller training corpus . We then comprehensively study detoxifying LMs with parameter sizes ranging from 126M up to 530B ( 3 × larger than GPT - 3 ) , a scale that has never been studied before . We ﬁnd that i ) large LMs have similar toxicity levels as smaller ones given the same pre - training corpus , and ii ) large LMs require more endeavor to unlearn the toxic content seen at pre - training . We also explore parameter - efﬁcient training methods for detoxiﬁcation . We demonstrate that adding and training adapter - only layers in LMs not only saves a lot of parameters but also achieves a better trade - off between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for large - scale models .

However , recent studies [ 7 , 8 ] show that generative LMs can generate toxic and biased language , which raises ethical concerns for their safe deployment in real - world applications . Previous methods on reducing the toxicity of LMs can be categorized as : decoding - time methods , pre - training - based methods , and domain - adaptive training methods . Decoding - time methods [ 9 – 14 ] manipulate the output distribution or input prompts at the inference stage without modifying the original model parameters . These methods can be ﬂexible , but they either resort to some simple word ﬁltering strategies [ 10 ] , or increase the computational cost at the inference stage . For example , PPLM [ 9 ] requires multiple iterations of backward propagation through the LM when generating every token , which makes it prohibitively expensive to be deployed to production especially for large - scale LMs . 3 In contrast , pre - training - based methods directly ﬁlter out the potentially toxic ∗ Work done during an internship at NVIDIA . † Correspondence to : Boxin Wang < boxinw2 @ illinois . edu > , Wei Ping < wping @ nvidia . com > , Chaowei Xiao < xiaocw @ asu . edu > . 3 For example , the 530B Megatron - Turing NLG [ 6 ] requires 16 A100 80GB GPUs for autoregressive generation , but 280 GPUs for backward propagation for memory reasons . 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems ( NeurIPS 2022 ) . a r X i v : 2202 . 04173v3 [ c s . C L ] 21 O c t 2022 content within the pre - training corpus and retrain the model from scratch [ e . g . , 15 ] . However , it is difﬁcult to determine the ﬁltering criterion beforehand , and pre - training a large LM multiple times from scratch is quite expensive . Domain - adaptive training methods [ 10 , 16 ] further ﬁne - tune the pre - trained LMs on carefully curated datasets ( e . g . , Jigsaw , ﬁltered OWTC [ 17 ] ) . For instance , Gehman et al . [ 10 ] construct a nontoxic data corpus from an existing dataset , OWTC , via the Perspective API 4 and perform the ﬁne - tuning on the nontoxic corpus . Domain - adaptive training is more ﬂexible than pre - training methods , as one can still customize the model after the expensive pre - training process . Compared to the decoding - time methods , domain - adaptive training methods have the following advantages : i ) they can achieve fast and memory - efﬁcient inference , thus can be deployed in broader systems ; and ii ) they can largely reduce the model toxicity while still maintaining good LM quality measured by perplexity and downstream task performance as we will show in this work . In this paper , we explore the limits of domain - adaptive training for detoxifying language models along the following three aspects : 1 ) Training Corpus : Unlike previous methods using curated pre - training corpus for detoxiﬁcation , we propose to leverage the generative power of LMs to generate nontoxic corpus , which achieves better data efﬁciency for detoxiﬁcation . 2 ) Model Size : We systematically study and mitigate the toxicity issues in LMs with parameter sizes ranging from 126M to 530B , a scale that has never been studied before in this domain . 3 ) Parameter - efﬁcient Training : We investigate two parameter - efﬁcient paradigm : adapter [ 18 ] and preﬁx - tuning [ 19 ] , and compare them with whole model adaptation in a systematic way . We hope our work can shed light on the challenges of detoxifying large - scale LMs , as well as motivate the development of detoxiﬁcation techniques that are effective and parameter - efﬁcient without signiﬁcantly hurting the LM quality . Summary of Contributions : • We identify the trade - off between detoxiﬁcation effectiveness ( measured by Perspective API and human evaluation ) and language model quality ( measured by validation perplexity and downstream task accuracy ) . Existing approaches either suffer from limited detoxiﬁcation effectiveness or signiﬁcantly sacriﬁce the language model quality to detoxify generative LMs . • We propose Self - Generation Enabled domain - Adaptive Training ( SGEAT ) that uses a self - generated dataset for detoxiﬁcation . It mitigates the exposure bias [ 20 , 21 ] from the discrepancy between teacher - forced domain - adaptive training and autoregressive generation at test time , and thus achieves better data efﬁciency . In particular , we demonstrate that it consistently outperforms the baseline approach with domain - adaptive training on pre - training data ( DAPT ) by a wide margin across various model sizes in terms of automatic and human evaluations , even when we use only a 13 smaller corpus for training . By combining SGEAT with the state - of - the - art decoding - time method , we can further reduce the toxicity of large - scale generative LM . • From the perspective of model size , we ﬁnd that : i ) Large LMs have similar toxicity levels as smaller ones given the same pre - training corpus . This implies the toxicity comes from the training dataset , instead of the model size . ii ) Large LMs require more efforts ( e . g . , larger training corpus ) to reduce toxicity . • We explore two parameter - efﬁcient training methods for detoxiﬁcation , and observe that : i ) domain - adaptive training with adapter achieves a better trade - off between toxicity and perplexity than whole model adaptation for large - scale LMs , and the improvement is more signiﬁcant when the size of LMs increases ; ii ) preﬁx - tuning is less suitable for detoxiﬁcation and demonstrates limited detoxiﬁcation effectiveness and perplexity control . We organize the rest of the paper as follows . We discuss related work in § 2 and present our evaluation protocols in § 3 . We then systematically explore the domain - adaptive training with respect to training corpus in § 4 , model sizes in § 5 , and parameter efﬁciency in § 6 . We present the human evaluation result in § 7 , discuss the relationship between toxicity and bias in § 8 . 1 , and conclude the paper in § 9 . Some text samples can be found in Appendix D . 2 Related Work Large - scale language models ( LM ) have achieved state - of - the - art performance on various downstream tasks . However , they also exhibit undesirable behaviors in terms of ethical , robustness , privacy , and nonfactual generation issues [ 10 , 22 – 26 ] . For example , since they are pre - trained over a sizable 4 https : / / www . perspectiveapi . com / . 2 Table 1 : Evaluation of LM toxicity and quality across 5 different parameter sizes .

Recent studies [ e . g . , 27 – 29 ] show that pre - trained masked LMs display different levels toxicity and social biases . Another line of work focuses on the toxicity of autoregressive LMs . For instance , Wallace et al . [ 8 ] ﬁrst demonstrate that synthetic text prompts can cause racist continuations with GPT - 2 . Gehman et al . [ 10 ] extend the analysis of LM toxicity to non - synthetic prompts , and create a benchmark dataset R EAL T OXICITY P ROMPTS to provide a standard evaluation protocol via Perspective API to measure LM’s toxicity , which is adopted by many previous work . In this paper , we follow the standard setting to compare different detoxiﬁcation approaches on different - sized LMs . Decoding - time methods They manipulate the decoding - time behavior of the LMs without chang - ing the model parameters [ 9 – 14 ] . Simple approaches such as word ﬁltering and vocabulary shift - ing [ 10 ] directly lower the probability of toxic words ( e . g . , swearwords , slurs , vulgar slang ) being generated . Though efﬁcient , such approaches fail to consider the semantic meaning of the generated text at the sequence level . Thus , it cannot completely prevent from generating toxic sentences which contain no undesirable words from the blocklist [ 15 ] ( e . g . , “ poor people don’t deserve to live in nice houses ” ) . Xu et al . [ 13 ] perform sentence - level ﬁltering by generating K continuations given the same prompt and returning the most nontoxic sentence . Similarly , Self - Debiasing [ 11 ] uses K manually crafted templates to manipulate the decoding probability distribution and dynamically set the probability of toxic words to be low . However , these methods lead to K times longer than the normal decoding . PPLM [ 9 ] iteratively adds perturbation on the context vector at each step of decod - ing . Though with better detoxiﬁcation effectiveness , it suffers much more computational overhead due to multiple iterations of forwarding and backward propagation to generate the perturbations . GeDi [ 12 ] guides generation at each step with a second LM trained on nontoxic data by computing classiﬁcation probabilities for all possible next tokens . However , it requires an external LM trained on non - toxic data , which is not easy to access in practice . DE XPERT [ 14 ] controls the generation of large - scale pre - trained LM with an “expert” LM trained on non - toxic data and “anti - expert” LM trained on toxic data in a product of experts [ 30 ] . It achieves the state - of - the - art detoxiﬁcation results on R EAL T OXICITY P ROMPTS , but sacriﬁces the validation perplexity and downstream task accuracy . Domain - adaptive training methods They ﬁne - tune the pre - trained LMs to the non - toxic domain by training on curated nontoxic data [ 10 , 16 , 31 ] . Gehman et al . [ 10 ] use the DAPT framework [ 31 ] to further train LMs on the nontoxic subset ( ﬁltered via the Perspective API ) of pre - training corpus , OWTC , with GPT - 2 . Besides DAPT , Gehman et al . [ 10 ] propose to ﬁne - tune on a corpus with toxicity attribute token and prepend the nontoxic attribute token as prompt to yield nontoxic generation . Solaiman and Dennison [ 16 ] propose a human - crafted Values - Targeted Datasets to change model behavior and reﬂect a set of targeted values . Baheti et al . [ 32 ] focus on mitigating the offensive behavior in dialogue systems . They leverage crowd - sourcing to label a conversation dataset generated by an existing dialogue model , and use it for offensive detection and mitigating the offensive behavior via the controlled text generation . In this work , we focus on exploring the limits of domain - adaptive training methods to reduce the toxicity of language models , while maintaining good validation perplexity and downstream task accuracy . Reinforcement learning ( RL ) methods There are two concurrent work [ 33 , 34 ] that study the toxcity behavior of LM with RL . InstructGPT [ 33 ] requires collecting human demonstrations and rankings of model outputs for two - stage ﬁne - tunings . It generates 25 % fewer toxic outputs with respectful instruction on R EAL T OXICITY P ROMPTS than 175B GPT - 3 . In contrast , our SGEAT reduces 27 % toxic outputs from 530B model on R EAL T OXICITY P ROMPTS , and the improvements are higher for smaller models ( e . g . , reduces 37 % toxic outputs from 8B model ) . To identify the toxic LM behavior , Perez et al . [ 34 ] uses RL to improve the generation of adversarial test cases . 3 Poor people don’t deserve to livein nice houses Poor people don’t deserve to livein nice houses Poor people don’t deserve to livein squalor and disease 70 % LM API Poor people don’t deserve to livein squalor and disease 40 % … Poor people _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ … LM Poor people also hope to live in nice houses Poor people don’t deserve to livein squalor and disease … … Fine - tuning … Update Prompt Construction Self - generation Data Filtering Figure 1 : Overview of the SGEAT method . SGEAT constructs prompts to leverage the LMs to generate a corpus for domain - adaptive training . Then , the generated corpus is further ﬁltered via Perspective API to ensure that the curated dataset has low toxicity . Finally , we use the ﬁltered texts to further perform domain - adaptive training for detoxiﬁcation . 3 Evaluation Protocols In this section , we present our principle for evaluating different detoxiﬁcation methods . Speciﬁcally , we emphasize that detoxiﬁcation method should focus on both reducing the model toxicity and maintaining the model quality after detoxiﬁcation . We ﬁrst discuss the protocol for LM toxicity evaluation , and then present the protocol to evaluate the LM quality before and after detoxiﬁcation . Pre - trained LMs . We investigate the toxicity of a variety of standard GPT - 3 like LMs with different parameter sizes , ranging from 126M ( similar to GPT - 3 Small ) , 357M ( similar to GPT - 3 Medium ) , 1 . 3B ( similar to GPT - 3 XL ) , 8 . 3B to the largest 530B [ 6 ] . All of the models are based on Trans - former [ 35 ] with different hidden dimension , number of layers , and attention heads . We present more details in Appendix § A . 1 . All standard models are pre - trained on the same pre - training corpus , which is an English text corpus constructed from 15 high - quality datasets . 3 . 1 Toxicity Evaluation In this work , we follow prior work [ 15 , 10 ] and perform both automatic evaluation and human evaluation to measure an LM’s tendency to generate toxic language . Automatic Evaluation relies on Perspective API , an online automated model for toxic language and hate speech detection . As discussed in the recent work [ 13 , 15 , 10 ] , such a model is imperfect and demonstrates biases against different demographic groups . Despite the problems , it still provides a low - cost and scalable approach to evaluate the generation toxicity of LMs . Moreover , both our study in Section 7 and Welbl et al . [ 15 ] ﬁnd that the toxicity scores from Perspective API are strongly correlated with human evaluation , thus it is meaningful to approximately measure LM toxicity . We note that Perspective API update the models regularly . The scores returned by Perspective API may change over time . The toxicity scores reported in the following sections were evaluated before May 2022 . We use the full set of the prompts ( around 100k ) from R EAL T OXICITY P ROMPT benchmark [ 10 ] to evaluate LM generations via Perspective API in terms of Expected Maximum Toxicity and Toxicity Probability . Speciﬁcally , Expected Maximum Toxicity evaluates the worst - case generation by calculating the maximum toxicity scores over 25 generations under the same prompt with different random seeds , and averaging the maximum toxicity scores over all prompts . Toxicity Probability estimates the empirical frequency of generating toxic language , which evaluates the probability of generating a toxic continuation ( T OXICITY > = 0 . 5 ) at least once over 25 generations for all prompts . We follow Gehman et al . [ 10 ] and restrict the generations up to 20 tokens or below . We present the automatic evaluation of ﬁve LMs with different parameter sizes in Table 1 . Human Evaluation is indispensable for toxicity evaluation , as toxicity judgments are subjective and should ultimately be human - centric [ 15 ] . Speciﬁcally , we adapt the instructions from Welbl et al . [ 15 ] and ask human annotators to evaluate the continuations . More details of human evaluation and how we ensure the emotional well - being of annotators can be found in Section 7 and Appendix § A . 3 . 3 . 2 LM Quality Evaluation To understand the impact of detoxiﬁcation , we evaluate the quality of LM along two fronts : perplexity and utility . Perplexity ( PPL ) is evaluated on a held - out validation set of pre - training corpus 5 , 5 We also evaluate PPL on the ﬁltered nontoxic portions of the validation set in Appendix § C . 2 . We observe the same trends of PPL increase as the full held - out validation set . 4 Table 2 : Evaluation of LM toxicity and quality across different detoxiﬁcation methods on the 1 . 3B LM .

The utility is estimated by the performance on downstream tasks . In particular , we evaluate the accuracy of LMs given 9 different tasks , covering question answering , natural language understanding , and commonsense reasoning , in the zero - shot learning scheme . We base the downstream tasks evaluation on Gao et al . [ 36 ] . We present the LM quality evaluation of 5 pre - trained LMs in Table 1 . More details about each downstream task and the accuracy for each task can be found in Appendix § A . 3 . We note some recent work [ 13 , 15 ] demonstrates that existing detoxiﬁcation techniques can amplify the social biases against minority groups . In this work , we mainly focus on the intrinsic quality of LM and analyze how it degrades after detoxiﬁcation . We leave the bias discussion in § 8 . 1 . In the following sections , we use above evaluation protocols to explore the limits of domain - adaptive training for detoxiﬁcation on three dimensions : training corpus , model sizes , and parameter efﬁciency . 4 Impact of Training Corpus Training corpus is a core factor that impacts the effectiveness and efﬁciency of domain - adaptive training . The state - of - the - art approach , DAPT [ 10 ] , adopts a pre - training corpus [ 17 ] curated by Perspective API to construct the training dataset for detoxiﬁcation . In this section , we propose Self - Generation Enabled domain - Adaptive Training ( SGEAT ) , which leverages the generative power of LM itself to construct a training corpus for domain adaptive training . To control the variable and have a fair comparison with the existing approach , we also use Perspective API to curate our self - generated corpus . We show that SGEAT can further push the limits of domain - adaptive training for detoxiﬁcation with better data efﬁciency . 4 . 1 SGEAT As shown in Figure 1 , SGEAT consists of four steps : 1 ) prompt construction ; 2 ) self - generation ; 3 ) data ﬁltering ; and 4 ) domain - adaptive training . Prompt construction is the core part of SGEAT to guide LM to generate a training corpus . We study three variants of SGEAT with different prompt designs : 1 ) SGEAT ( standard ) uses no prompt and performs unconditional generation . 2 ) SGEAT ( heuristic ) uses a set of manually crafted prompts inspired by the deﬁnition of toxicity from Perspective API . We discuss the set of considered tem - plates in Appendix § B and report the one that achieves the lowest toxicity in our experiments . 3 ) SGEAT ( augmented ) constructs prompts that tend to yield nontoxic continuations . Speciﬁcally , we ﬁnd the most nontoxic documents from the unconditional generation , and split each document into half as the prompts and the continuations . In this way , we obtain the prompts that are highly likely to generate nontoxic language . SGEAT ( augmented ) can also be regarded as a data augmentation of SGEAT ( standard ) from the nontoxic distribution . We present more details in Appendix § B . Self - Generation uses the prompts from the last step to generate up to 1 , 000 tokens and truncate all the sentences at the end - of - document ( EOD ) token once generated . We use nucleus sampling [ 37 ] with p = 0 . 9 and the temperature of 1 during generation . To demonstrate the data efﬁciency of SGEAT , we generate only 100k documents in total , in comparison with DAPT in Gehman et al . [ 10 ] that uses 7500k documents from the pre - training corpus . 5 Data Filtering further ﬁlters out toxic samples to ensure the training corpus is mostly nontoxic . Speciﬁcally , we follow the standard DAPT setup in Gehman et al . [ 10 ] and use Perspective API to annotate the toxicity of the raw generated text . Different from DAPT that performs aggressive ﬁltering on pre - training data and only keeps the most nontoxic 2 % of the documents , we keep the most nontoxic 50 % of the generated text to demonstrate the quality and data efﬁciency of SGEAT . We present the curated data toxicity and statistics in Appendix Table 13 . Domain - Adaptive Training leverages the curated nontoxic corpus to further ﬁne - tune the pre - trained LM with standard log - likelihood loss and adapt it to the nontoxic data domain . We present more training details in Appendix § A . 2 . 4 . 2 Evaluation Results of Domain - Adaptive Training In this subsection , we evaluate existing domain - adaptive training methods on 1 . 3B LM ( similar to GPT3 - XL ) , and discuss the impacts of model sizes in Section 5 . Baselines : We consider the following domain - adaptive training baselines : DAPT ( nontoxic ) [ 31 ] uses a nontoxic subset of pre - training corpus annotated by Perspective API to perform domain - adaptive training ; and Jigsaw ( nontoxic ) uses a human - annotated nontoxic subset of Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classiﬁcation dataset 6 . We present the evaluation results in Table 2 . Among all domain - adaptive training methods , we ﬁnd that SGEAT ( augmented ) achieves the lowest toxicity scores with moderate perplexity increases and without degrading the LM utility accuracy ( or even improving ) . Speciﬁcally , SGEAT ( augmented ) reduces the toxicity of the standard 1 . 3B by 0 . 14 at the cost of a slight PPL increase and does not hurt the utility of LMs on downstream tasks . Moreover , we note that although DAPT ( nontoxic ) uses 3 times larger corpus than SGEAT ( augmented ) ( shown in Appendix Table 13 ) , SGEAT ( augmented ) still achieves lower toxicity than DAPT ( nontoxic ) , which implies that self - generated data has better data efﬁciency for domain - adaptive training . We think such high data efﬁciency comes from the fact that i ) the self - generated corpus well captures the high - density regions of the output space of a pre - trained LM , and ii ) training on autoregressively generated corpus mitigates the exposure bias [ 20 , 21 ] , which refers to the train - test discrepancy of an autoregressive model . Thus , when we train the LM on the self - generated non - toxic corpus , it tends to increase the likelihood on the non - toxic density region , which enables data - efﬁcient training to detoxify the model . The human - annotated nontoxic Jigsaw dataset fails to detoxify the LM and even increases the model toxicity . We speculate the major reason is that the nontoxic subset of the Jigsaw dataset has a much higher average data toxicity than SGEAT , as shown in Appendix Table 13 . Among SGEAT methods , we observe that SGEAT ( augmented ) achieves the best detoxiﬁcation result at a similar level of PPL increase , while SGEAT ( heuristic ) is less effective to detoxify the LM . We think the reason lies in the data diversity : The unconditional generation covers the diverse regions of the generation distribution and yields the most diverse data distribution , and thus SGEAT ( standard ) also achieves good detoxiﬁcation performance . In contrast , SGEAT ( heuristic ) uses only a single prompt for generation , which limits the diversity of the generation . More analysis about prompt design is in Appendix § B . 6 . 4 . 3 Evaluation Results of Decoding - time Methods Besides the domain - adaptive training baselines , we also compare with decoding - time algorithms : Word Banning [ 10 ] sets the probability of generating any word from a list 7 of profanity , slurs , and swearwords to zero during decoding . Rejection sampling [ 15 , 13 ] generates up to K samples given each prompt until we obtain a nontoxic sample , otherwise we return the sample with the lowest toxicity score from Perspective API . We set K = 4 due to the computational limit . DE XPERTS [ 14 ] is the state - of - the - art decoding - time algorithm for detoxiﬁcation that uses two auxiliary expert and anti - expert LMs to steer a model’s generation . The expert model is the same as DAPT ( nontoxic ) ; while the anti - expert model is ﬁne - tuned on the top toxic portion of OWTC with 150k documents . When comparing domain - adaptive training methods with decoding - time methods . We note that rejection sampling adds 4 × computational overhead during decoding , but is less effective than domain - adaptive training SGEAT , as LM rarely generates nontoxic continuations given toxic prompts 6 https : / / www . kaggle . com / c / jigsaw - toxic - comment - classification - challenge / 7 https : / / github . com / LDNOOBW / List - of - Dirty - Naughty - Obscene - and - Otherwise - Bad - Words 6 Table 3 : Evaluation of LM toxicity and quality of domain - adaptive training methods along 5 different parameter sizes . 530B † is trained with more self - generated data ( 100k samples ) . 530B ‡ is trained with more epochs ( 5 epochs ) , while the others are trained with 3 epochs . ↑ and ↓ are compared against the standard LM of the corresponding size .

Although the state - of - the - art DE XPERTS achieves signiﬁcantly lower toxicity scores than SGEAT , we also observe that there is a concerning perplexity and utility degradation , with an increase of 9 . 47 in PPL and a drop of 9 . 4 % in downstream task accuracy . Such degradation makes the detoxiﬁed 1 . 3B LM quality even worse than a standard 126M LM , as shown in Table 1 . We hope that our ﬁndings can motivate researchers to focus more on the trade - off between detoxiﬁcation and LM quality when designing detoxiﬁcation algorithms . Since decoding - time algorithms are orthogonal to domain - adaptive training methods , it is easy to combine both methods together . Speciﬁcally , we replace the standard 1 . 3B model used in rejection sampling and DE XPERTS with SGEAT ( augmented ) detoxiﬁed one , and observe that the combined method can yield the lowest toxicity scores among existing methods . 5 Impact of Model Size We next investigate how the number of model parameters impacts the domain - adaptive training for detoxiﬁcation . Speciﬁcally , we show that 1 ) models with different number of parameters trained on the same pre - training corpus display similar levels of toxicity ; 2 ) self - generated data consistently demonstrates better detoxiﬁcation effectiveness than pre - training corpus across different parameter sizes ; 3 ) larger LMs require more efforts to reduce the toxicity . Standard Model Toxicity . We ﬁrst evaluate the toxicity of 5 standard LMs across different parameter sizes in Table 1 and Table 9 . We observe that the standard LMs , pre - trained on the same pre - training data with different parameter sizes , display similar levels of toxicity . It suggests that the toxicity comes from the dataset , instead of the model size . Detoxiﬁcation Effectiveness of SGEAT . We then evaluate our best SGEAT ( augmented ) and com - pare with the best domain - adaptive training baseline DAPT ( nontoxic ) in Table 3 . We note that SGEAT consistently outperforms DAPT over different sizes even when using 1 / 3 smaller training corpus . For example , SGEAT ( augmented ) can reduce the toxicity probability from 57 % to 30 % for the 126M LM , 7 % lower than DAPT . These results conﬁrm that : the self - generated corpus is more efﬁcient to detoxify the LM than using the curated corpus of pre - training data . Larger - scale LMs requires more endeavors to detoxify . From Table 3 , we observe the detoxiﬁca - tion effectiveness decays for both DAPT and SGEAT with the increase of LM parameter sizes . For instance , the toxicity probability of the 530B SGEAT LM is only the 16 % lower than the standard 530B LM , compared to the drop of 27 % toxicity probability for the 126M one . We ﬁgure the potential reason of such small improvement on larger LM is that large LM tends to require more training data and ﬁne - tuning epochs to detoxify . Therefore , we conduct additional experiments on the 530B LM , by either increasing the training epochs from 3 to 5 or generate more data from 50k to 100k samples for adaptive training . We ﬁnd that while both methods further reduce the toxicity of the 530B LM , training for more epochs might lead to model overﬁtting and hurts the PPL and downstream accuracy by a large margin . In contrast , training with more data demonstrates a better trade - off between detoxiﬁcation and LM quality . It implies that it needs more endeavors to detoxify large - scale LMs . 7 Table 4 : Evaluation of LM toxicity and perplexity of parameter - efﬁcient training methods . ↑ and ↓ are compared against whole model adaptation .

We also evaluate whether domain - adaptive training impacts the perplexity and utility of LMs in Table 3 . When trained within 3 epochs , we ﬁnd that the PPL of LMs slightly increases and the LM utility drops a little in most cases , which suggest that models gradually adapt to the nontoxic domain without a signiﬁcant sign of overﬁtting or degradation in terms of LM quality . 6 . 5 7 . 0 7 . 5 8 . 0 8 . 5 9 . 0 9 . 5 PPL 0 . 44 0 . 46 0 . 48 0 . 50 0 . 52 0 . 54 0 . 56 E x pe c t ed M a x .

Domain Adaptation v . s . Overﬁtting . We visu - alize the trade - off at different training phases in Figure 2 for 530B LM . Speciﬁcally , we record the validation perplexity and model toxicity after 1 , 3 , and 5 training epochs for DAPT ( nontoxic , 150k ) and SGEAT ( augmented , 50k ) . We also add a curve DAPT ( nontoxic , 50k ) , which samples 50k documents from DAPT ( nontoxic , 150k ) to have a fair comparison with SGEAT ( augmented , 50k ) . We observe that at the beginning of training , the model toxicity drops substantially and barely sacriﬁces the model PPL ( steep slope ) . Then it is gradually adapted towards the nontoxic domain . SGEAT demonstrates a better trade - off between toxicity and quality , as SGEAT achieves substan - tially lower toxicity with the same PPL after 1 epoch of training . Finally , we observe the curve is becoming more ﬂat , especially for DAPT , which indicates the transition from the domain adaptation to overﬁtting . For LMs with different sizes ﬁne - tuned with different methods , we ﬁnd 3 epochs is a good cut - off point for whole model adaption , which achieves good trade - off between model toxicity and perplexity . This rule of thumb is also aligned with previous study [ 10 ] . 6 Parameter - efﬁcient Training To cope with the challenges of large - scale LMs , we explore two parameter - efﬁcient training paradigms : adapter [ 18 ] and preﬁx tuning [ 19 ] , and evaluate whether they can improve the LM quality and achieve a better trade - off between detoxiﬁcation and LM quality than whole model adaption . We show that : in the scenario of detoxiﬁcation , 1 ) adapter demonstrates a better trade - off than preﬁx tuning , and 2 ) adapter can further mitigate the drop of LM quality and improve the trade - off upon whole - model adaptation for large - scale LMs . 6 . 1 Comparison between Adapter and Preﬁx Tuning Both adapter and preﬁx tuning add additional parameters to the standard LM , and only optimize the added parameters during training without perturbing the original LM parameters . Such paradigm provides the ﬂexibility , especially for large - scale LMs , to adapt to different domains with a few additional parameters , rather than heavily ﬁne - tune the whole model with multiple copies of the 8 whole model parameters for different domains . In this study , we further investigate whether such training schemes can provide more advantages to detoxify LMs . Adapter [ 18 ] adds additional bottleneck projection layers to each transformer layer with residual connections . At the beginning of the training , the projection layer is initialized to almost zero to improve the training stability . Preﬁx tuning [ 19 ] appends additional continuous “preﬁx” vectors to the input to better steer LMs’ generations . To have a comprehensive understanding and comparison between adapter and preﬁx tuning , we ﬁrst perform ablation studies on small - scale 1 . 3B LM over the key hyper - parameters : the projection size for adapter and the preﬁx length for preﬁx tuning . We follow the same training schedules as whole model adaptation but train more epochs so that the PPL reaches a similar level as whole model adaptation . We present the evaluation results in Table 4 . When comparing Table 4a with Table 4b , we observe that adapter demonstrates a better trade - off between detoxiﬁcation and LM quality than preﬁx tuning . We ﬁgure the possible reasons are two folds : 1 ) given the same projection size and preﬁx length , the number of additional parameters of adapter is around twice more than preﬁx tuning , which gives more capacity for adapter to perform domain adaptation ; 2 ) however , while longer preﬁx length could give more capacity to steer the model generation , it also adds too many irrelevant contexts , which not only hurts the perplexity of the LM but also slows down the decoding speed . Compared to the whole model adaption , adapter does not show signiﬁcant advantages in terms of detoxiﬁcation and LM quality for small - scale models like 1 . 3B one . For adapter results with different projection sizes , we observe that a larger projection size yields better detoxiﬁcation effectiveness possibly due to larger model capacity . We thus apply adapter with the projection size = 1024 to larger - scale LMs ( 8 . 3B and 530B ) and investigate whether it can solve the challenges of large - scale LMs . 6 . 2 Apply Adapter to larger - scale Models We follow the same training schedules as the whole model adaptation to train the adapters for larger - scale LMs . We stop training when they reach similar levels of toxicity as the whole model adaptation , and evaluate the perplexity and utility of LMs in Table 5 . We can see that for larger - scale LMs , adapter can not only improve the parameter efﬁciency , but also mitigate the PPL and the LM quality drop . In particular , for the 530B model , adapter can mitigate the drop of PPL for at most 0 . 64 and improve the average downstream task accuracy by 0 . 7 % . 7 Human Evaluation We further verify our ﬁndings via human evaluation on the standard models , DAPT , SGEAT , and decoding - time algorithm DE XPERTS across ﬁve LM sizes . 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 0 . 40 0 . 45 0 . 50 0 . 55 0 . 60 Perspective API Average Max .

Perspective API scores for the different methods we evaluate . The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is 0 . 9661 . Setup . We sample the 300 prompts from R E - AL T OXICITY P ROMPT benchmark while keep - ing the ratio of toxic and nontoxic prompts to 1 : 3 as the same as the full set , and evaluate the continuations of each model . We follow Welbl et al . [ 15 ] to ask LMs to generate up to 100 tokens and avoid incomplete sentences and collect the most toxic continuations via Perspective API over 25 generations . Finally , we gather 5 , 700 continuations from 19 models and randomly shufﬂe them for human evalu - ation . Then we group samples into a batch of 10 , and assign them to 5 annotators . In total 187 workers from Amazon MTurk participated in the evaluation . To consider the annotators’ well - being , we make sure the average number of toxic samples ( T OXICITY > = 0 . 5 evaluated by Perspective API ) is less than or equal to 3 in each batch of 10 samples . To calculate the average scores of annotations , we follow Welbl et al . [ 15 ] to map “Very Toxicity” and “Toxic” to 1 , “Not Toxic” to 0 , and discard “Not Sure“ annotations . We average the scores from 5 annotators for each sample and then report the averaged number over the 300 prompts in Figure 3 . The detailed scores can be found in Table 8 in Appendix . We present more details in Appendix § A . 3 . By comparing the objective evaluation with human evaluation , 9 Table 6 : LM PPL in the gender and ethinicity domains on the BOLD dataset . ↑ : based on standard 1 . 3B LM .

Such ﬁndings are also conﬁrmed by Welbl et al . [ 15 ] . The human evaluation also veriﬁes that i ) LMs of different sizes have similar levels of toxicity , and ii ) LMs of larger sizes present more challenges to detoxify . 8 Discussion 8 . 1 Bias against Marginalized Groups We follow the setting of Welbl et al . [ 15 ] and evaluate the PPL of the 1 . 3B standard LM and SGEAT ( augmented ) ﬁne - tuned LM on the gender and ethnicity domains using the BOLD dataset [ 38 ] as shown in Table 6 . The former contains Wikipedia sentences about female and male actors , and the latter domain contains sentences about people with different ethnic backgrounds [ 15 ] . We ﬁnd that : ( i ) LM PPL increases moderately on the BOLD dataset after effective detoxiﬁcation , which is aligned with our ﬁndings in § 4 . 2 . ( ii ) There is no noticeable discrepancy of PPL increase among male and female in the gender domain , which suggests that SGEAT does not exacerbate the gender biases . ( iii ) There is a higher PPL increase for the Hispanic group than other demographic groups in the ethnicity domain . We hypothesize that such bias mainly comes from the pre - training model and corpus , because the pre - trained Standard model already has much higher perplexity for Hispanic group . Our ﬁndings partly align with recent ﬁndings on the trade - off between detoxiﬁcation and bias [ 13 , 15 ] . We leave it as an important future direction to mitigate the social biases of pre - trained foundation models , as well as design new approache that jointly reduce toxicity and racial bias . 8 . 2 Limitation of SGEAT While we observe that SGEAT has demonstrated very good trade - off between detoxiﬁcation effec - tiveness and perplexity , SGEAT still has potentials to further improve . Bias within Hate Speech Detector . Similar to DAPT , SGEAT also relies on a hate speech classiﬁer ( i . e . , Perspective API ) to ﬁlter out toxic samples . However , existing classiﬁer on toxicity classiﬁcation is imperfect and is known to amplify the social bias against different demographic groups due to the annotation bias and sampling bias [ 13 ] ( e . g . , the classiﬁer tend to assign higher toxicity scores for text mentioning historically underrepresented groups ) . As a result , SGEAT may also be impacted due to the use of Perspective API , which may ﬁlter both toxic text and minority identity mentions . Nevertheless , we believe that SGEAT can get more beneﬁts with a more robust , unbiased , and fair hate speech detector , so models ﬁne - tuned on the ﬁltered corpus can unlearn toxicity without forgetting corpus from minority groups . Bias within Pre - trained Model . As discussed in § 8 . 1 , we observe pre - trained models already exhibit bias against certain demographic groups . As a result , the self - generated corpus may inherit the bias and harm the coverage of detoxiﬁcation . Thus we leave it as an important future direction to build a bias - free pre - trained LM , which can beneﬁt SGEAT and other detoxiﬁcation methods . 9 Conclusion We explore the limits of domain - adaptive training for detoxifying LMs along three aspects : 1 ) training corpus ; 2 ) model size and 3 ) parameter - efﬁcient training . We ﬁrst identify the trade - off between detoxiﬁcation effectiveness and LM quality in detoxiﬁcation methods . We propose Self - Generation Enabled domain - Adaptive Training ( SGEAT ) , which leverages the generative power of LMs for data - efﬁcient and effective detoxiﬁcation . We comprehensively detoxify LMs with parameters sizes ranging from 126M up to 530B and ﬁnd interesting properties of large - scale LMs . We demonstrate that adapter provides parameter - efﬁcient training and achieves a better trade - off of toxicity and LM quality . We hope our work can shed light on the development of detoxiﬁcation techniques that can largely reduce toxicity while maintaining good perplexity and downstream task accuracies . 10 References [ 1 ] Alec Radford , Jeff Wu , Rewon Child , David Luan , Dario Amodei , and Ilya Sutskever .

A . 2 Training Details Throughout our experiments , we follow the setup of Gehman et al . [ 10 ] and ﬁne - tune the LMs for 3 epochs . We use the batch size equal to 512 with sequence length 2048 . We use the Adam optimizer ( epsilon = 1e - 5 , beta - 1 = 0 . 9 , beta - 2 = 0 . 95 ) with initial lr = 1e - 5 for 530B LM , while we use lr = 2e - 5 for all other LMs . We set weight decay to 0 . 1 for all LMs . Our experiments are conducted on the DGX A100 servers with 8x A100 GPUs . A . 3 Details of Evaluation Protocols Details of Human evaluation Asking humans to annotate toxicity necessarily exposes them to toxic language . Before conducting our study , it was reviewed by our Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Participants were recruited through Amazon MTurk . Since toxicity evaluation is subjective to different social groups , we do not have any constraints on the demographic background of annotators . Since our toxicity evaluation mainly focuses on English , we also constrain the regions of annotators to the United States , Canada , Australia , and the United Kingdom . To improve the quality of the annotations , we require the participated annotators to have at least 1000 approved HITs and a lifelong HIT approval rate is greater than 98 % . We group continuations in a batch of 10 samples and assign them to annotators . The payment rate for each batch of samples is $ 0 . 7 . We follow the deﬁnition of Perspective API and Welbl et al . [ 15 ] on toxicity as follows : • Very Toxic : Text that is very hateful , aggressive , disrespectful , or otherwise very likely to make a user leave a discussion or give up on sharing their perspective . • Toxic : Text that is rude , disrespectful , unreasonable , or otherwise likely to make a user leave a discussion or give up on sharing their perspective . • Not Toxic : Neutral , civil , or even nice text very unlikely to discourage the conversation . We adapt the instructions from Welbl et al . [ 15 ] and show the annotation instructions on Amazon MTurk platform in Figure 4 and Figure 5 . We put the detailed human - annotated toxicity scores in Table 8 and compare with Perspective API . We observe that the toxicity scores from the human evaluation are mostly aligned with objective evaluation via Perspective API . Details of PPL Evaluation We evaluate the LM PPL on a held - out validation set from the pre - training corpus . Note that , the validation set can be different from the one in Smith et al . [ 6 ] due to different random seed and chunking . 15 Figure 4 : Human evaluation instructions for toxicity evaluation . Figure 5 : Human annotation interface for toxicity evaluation . Details of Downstream Task Evaluation We consider the following 9 downstream tasks : • ANLI [ 39 ] is a large - scale NLI adversarial benchmark dataset . • BoolQ [ 40 ] is a question answering dataset for yes / no questions . • Hellaswag [ 41 ] is a commonsense NLI dataset . • LAMBADA [ 42 ] is a cloze test ( word prediction ) dataset . • PIQA [ 43 ] is a physical commonsense reasoning and a corresponding benchmark dataset . • RACE [ 44 ] is a large - scale reading comprehension dataset . • WiC [ 45 ] is a multilingual Word - in - Context Dataset for the evaluation of context - sensitive word embeddings . • WinoGrande [ 46 ] is commonsense reasoning for pronoun resolution problems .

The checkpoint of the 530B model used for evaluation is different from the one in Smith et al . [ 6 ] . B Details of Prompt Design Our prompt exploration starts from unconditional generation , and then moves on to the conditional generation scenarios for investigating which prompts can best facilitate LMs to generate high - quality nontoxic data . B . 1 Unconditional Generation By only taking the start - of - sentence token 8 as input , unconditional generation unveils the intrinsic self - generation quality given no prompt and thus tends to yield the most diverse data distribution . During the generation , we use different random seeds to collect a total of 100 , 000 self - generated samples as SGEAT ( standard ) . 8 GPT - 2 and GPT - 3 take < | endoftext | > as the start - of - sentence token . 17 B . 2 Conditional Generation Prompts provide language models with context to generate a variety of desired contents . For detoxiﬁcation purposes , we aim to design prompts such that language models can generate high - quality and diverse nontoxic data . Manually - crafted Prompts ( SGEAT ( heuristic ) ) We start with the deﬁnition of toxicity following Perspective API as the seed template . Then we manually craft prompts to perform self - generation and evaluate their detoxiﬁcation performances . Speciﬁcally , we follow the deﬁnition of toxicity from Perspective API as well as the inspiration by the recent work from Prompt Engineering [ 47 , 48 , 19 , 49 – 52 ] that repeating the prompts and prompting LMs in the format of Question Answering , and design the prompts below to study the generation and understanding power of the LMs , 1 . Negative Prompt ( for once ) . The following text does not contain rude , disrespectful , and unreasonable languages : _ _ _ . 2 . Positive Prompt ( for once ) . The following text contains kind , respectful , and reasonable languages : _ _ _ . 3 . Positive Prompt twice . Repeating the above prompt twice . 4 . Positive Prompt in the format of QA . Question : The following text contains kind , respectful , and reasonable languages . Answer : _ _ _ . 5 . Positive Prompt twice in the format of QA . Repeating the above prompt twice . For each prompt , we generate 100 , 000 continuations , and use them as a self - generated dataset before data ﬁltering . Automatically - constructed Prompts ( SGEAT ( augmented ) ) As we will show in the experiment , manually - crafted prompts suffer from the limited templates and may impact the diversity of the self - generated data . Inspired by Gehman et al . [ 10 ] , we design the following process to automatically construct prompts : i ) We use the unconditional generated data in § B . 1 as the source data to construct prompts , as it represents the distribution of LM while keeping the data diversity . ii ) We apply Perspective API to annotate the unconditionally generated data , and select the most nontoxic 25 % data , which in total collects the most nontoxic 25 , 000 documents . iii ) We split each document into two parts , yielding 25 , 000 prompts and continuations . For each prompt , we generate 4 continuations and eventually collect 100 , 000 self - generated samples before data ﬁltering . We list a glossary of prompts ( automatically - constructed prompts and manually - crafted prompts ) we considered along with their explanation and examples in Table 10 . B . 3 Unprompted Toxicity During unconditional generation to construct prompts , we can also evaluate the unprompted toxicity ( i . e . , unconditional generation scenario ) of LMs of different sizes . We present the unconditional generated data toxicity in Table 12 . We can see that standard LMs yield similar levels of data toxicity in the unconditional generation scenario , which is also aligned with the observations in our main experiment . B . 4 Data Toxicity given Automatically - constructed Prompts Furthermore , given our automatically - constructed prompts , our SGEAT demonstrates lower data toxicity than an unconditional generation , as shown in Table 12 . B . 5 Data Diversity Evaluation Data diversity is also an important factor that can impact the detoxiﬁcation effectiveness . To avoid generating duplicated data , we use nucleus sampling [ 37 ] with p = 0 . 9 with different random seeds , which signiﬁcantly reduces the probability to generate duplicated output .

We high - light the methods that yields the lowest data toxicity . The standard deviation is calculated across the set of generated sentences . this setting will have on average more than 200 candidate tokens to sample at each step , and we generate up to 1000 steps . Thus the likelihood of generating duplicated data should be very small . To further verify the ﬁndings , we evaluate the diversity of SGEAT ( heuristic ) , SGEAT ( standard ) , and OWTC using distinct - 1 , distinct - 2 , distinct3 , and distinct - 4 , which measures the number of distinct n - grams of the corpus [ 53 ] . The results are shown in the Table 14 . We ﬁnd that SGEAT ( heuristic ) indeed generates less diverse data than SGEAT ( standard ) , and thus limits the effectiveness of detoxiﬁcation . In contrast , the diversity of SGEAT ( standard ) is relatively close to the real - world corpus OWTC . B . 6 Benchmark and Analysis of Prompt Design As the core of SGEAT is the prompt design , we perform a systematic study on the 1 . 3B LM to evaluate how different prompts impact the self - generated data quality , which further affects the detoxiﬁcation performance . We evaluate the prompts following two fronts : i ) Data Toxicity , which directly evaluates the generated data toxicity scores via Perspective API in Table 13 . Speciﬁcally , we report the average toxicity of the generated data , the probability of generating toxic and nontoxic samples , their corresponding toxicity , and their toxicity scores after ﬁltering ; and ii ) Model Toxicity , which evaluates the ﬁnal performance ﬁne - tuned with the generated data in Table 11 .

We mark the generations with signiﬁcant degeneration after human inspections . We highlight the prompt that yields the lowest data toxicity without loss of diversity .

This result is also aligned with the observation in Table 13 that automatically - constructed prompts yield the least average data toxicity ( 0 . 07 ) . ii ) Low data toxicity does not necessarily lead to good model toxicity after ﬁne - tuning . Diversity also matters . When we choose the least nontoxic prompt from automatically - constructed prompts as the single prompt for generation , we ﬁnd that although the generated dataset achieves the average data toxicity as low as 4e - 4 , the toxicity reduction is not as effective as using all automatic - constructed prompts . We think the reason is that both data toxicity and data diversity contribute to the detoxiﬁ - cation effectiveness . The prompts with lower data toxicity can more effectively pull the generation distribution from the toxic domain to the nontoxic domain , while the higher prompt diversity can cover more regions of the generation distribution , thus yielding lower model toxicity . iii ) Manually - crafted prompts are not enough to generate high - quality non - toxic data . Therefore , manually - crafted prompts yield worse detoxiﬁcation effectiveness than unconditional generation . The unconditional generation covers the diverse regions of the generation distribution and yields the most diverse data distribution , and thus also achieves good detoxiﬁcation performance . In contrast , human - crafted prompts use only a single prompt for generation , which limits the diversity of the generation . Moreover , the generation tends to follow the topics of the prompts related to toxicity , and thus is more likely to yield toxic samples than unconditional generation , as shown in Table 13 . We also note that repeating the positive prompt twice can cause lower toxicity in the continuations , while prompting the language model in the question - answering format [ 54 ] is less helpful for generating lower toxicity data . In addition , using negative prompts may even backﬁre and increase the model toxicity , suggesting that it is better to prompt language models in a positive way instead of using negations . iv ) Human - annotated nontoxic Jigsaw dataset fails to detoxify the LM , and even increases the model toxicity . We think there are two main reasons : 1 ) the nontoxic subset of the Jigsaw dataset has much higher data toxicity than the ﬁltered OWTC ; 2 ) the Jigsaw data has some domain shift from the pre - training data distribution , and thus limits the effectiveness for detoxiﬁcation .

C . 2 Perplexity Evaluation on Nontoxic Validation Set Hypothesis We hypothesize that the reasons for the perplexity increase on the validation set of the pre - training data after domain - adaptive training are two fold : 1 ) The validation set may contain toxic language , while the LMs are already adapted to the nontoxic domain . Thus it is expected that the LM loss on the toxic portion increase after detoxiﬁcation , which leads to the PPL increase on the full validation set . 2 ) The ﬁltered non - toxic corpus are not perfect ( e . g . , poor coverage of language for different topics ) , which may hurt the LM’s quality after domain - adaptive training . This is also conﬁrmed by the degradation of down - stream task accuracy . To verify the hypothesis , we further ﬁlter our validation set based on Perspective API to construct several nontoxic corpora , and evaluate the LM PPL on these nontoxic corpus . Setup We construct three validation set with different ﬁlter rates as shown in Table 19 , where Nontoxic @ x % refers that we keep the most x % of nontoxic documents for PPL evaluation . We also present the PPL evaluation on Nontoxic @ 10 % for all detoxiﬁcation methods we consider for the 1 . 3B model in Table 20 . Analysis We ﬁnd that : 1 ) The PPL increase on the nontoxic subsets of validation corpus is less than that on the full validation set . This suggests that the toxic documents in the validation set indeed lead to some of the PPL increase for our detoxiﬁed language models . 2 ) The lower the average toxicity score the validation set has , the less PPL increases . 3 ) The trend of PPL increase on nontoxic corpus is almost the same as that on the full validation set . Thus we report the standard PPL increase on our full held - out set in our main paper to reﬂect the level of LM quality degradation . C . 3 Perplexity Evaluation on Self - Generated Data v . s . Pre - training Data Hypothesis We think such high data efﬁciency comes from the fact that i ) the self - generated corpus well captures the high - density regions of the output space of a pre - trained LM , and ii ) training on 22 Tasks Models + Adapter DAPT ( 8 . 3B ) DAPT ( 530B ) SGEAT ( 8 . 3B ) SGEAT ( 530B ) ANLI - R2 34 . 0 36 . 5 33 . 6 36 . 1 BoolQ 62 . 9 76 . 4 66 . 5 76 . 3 HANS 48 . 8 57 . 7 47 . 9 51 . 9 HellaSwag 72 . 9 81 . 3 70 . 2 79 . 0 Lambada 73 . 8 71 . 9 73 . 1 75 . 9 PiQA 78 . 6 81 . 0 78 . 3 80 . 9 RACE 45 . 2 47 . 5 44 . 4 48 . 6 WiC 50 . 8 48 . 9 50 . 2 47 . 7 WinoGrande 67 . 4 72 . 1 66 . 5 73 . 1 Avg .

PPL of word banning goes to inﬁnity as the probabilities of some banned words are set to zero . ↑ and ↓ are compared against the standard 1 . 3B LM . Nontoxic PPL is evaluated on the nontoxic corpus @ 10 % . autoregressively generated corpus mitigates the exposure bias [ 20 , 21 ] , which refers to the train - test discrepancy of an autoregressive model . 23 Setup We leverage the PPL to verify it . If the generated corpus shows a lower PPL , it means that the corpus better captures the high - density region of the LM . We evaluate and compare the PPL of the generated corpus of SGEAT ( augmented ) and OWTC by the standard 1 . 3B LM . Analysis We ﬁnd that SGEAT ( augmented ) demonstrates a much lower PPL ( 5 . 98 ) than OWTC ( 7 . 93 ) , which conﬁrms our hypothesis that our generated corpus SGEAT ( augmented ) better captures the high - density regions of the LM output space . C . 4 Transferring Self - Generated Dataset from Larger Models to Smaller Models We ﬁne - tune a 126M model with the 1 . 3B generated corpus SGEAT ( augmented ) following the same training strategy . We evaluate the expected maximum toxicity and perplexity and compare with the 126M ﬁne - tuned with 126M generated corpus SGEAT ( augmented ) . The results are shown in Table 21 below . 126M Model SGEAT ( augmented , 126M ) SGEAT ( augmented , 1 . 3B ) Exp . Max . Toxicity 0 . 39 ↓ 0 . 17 0 . 41 ↓ 0 . 15 Valid PPL 19 . 55 ↑ 1 . 79 18 . 76 ↑ 1 . 00 Table 21 : Transferring Self - Generaetd Data from 1 . 3B SGEAT ( augmented , 1 . 3B ) to ﬁne - tune 126M model . In terms of toxicity reduction , we observe that using the generated corpus from a larger LM to ﬁne - tune a smaller LM is not as effective as using the self - generated corpus , which emphasizes the importance of ﬁne - tuning with self - generated data to mitigate the exposure bias . However , the corpus generated from 1 . 3B LM does have better language quality than 126M and is closer to the pre - training corpus , thus leading to a better validation PPL than the self - generated corpus . C . 5 Mixing Nontoxic Pre - training Corpus and Self - Generated Data We ﬁne - tune the mixed dataset of DAPT and SGEAT ( augmented ) with the mixture ratio of 0 . 5 ( half of the documents are sampled from DAPT , and the other half are sampled from SGEAT ( augmented ) ) . We follow the same training schedules and iterations of DAPT ( nontoxic ) to ﬁne - tune the LM on the mixed dataset . The results are shown in the Table 22 below . 1 . 3B Model SGEAT ( augmented ) DAPT ( nontoxic ) Mix of SGEAT and DAPT Exp . Max . Toxicity 0 . 43 ↓ 0 . 14 0 . 47 ↓ 0 . 10 0 . 46 ↓ 11 Valid PPL 11 . 19 ↑ 1 . 01 10 . 40 ↑ 0 . 22 10 . 67 ↑ 0 . 49 Table 22 : Transferring Self - Generaetd Data from 1 . 3B SGEAT ( augmented , 1 . 3B ) to ﬁne - tune 126M model . From the results , we can see that the detoxiﬁcation effect of the mixed SGEAT and DAPT is an interpolation of both methods . We agree that combining these two methods does yield a better trade - off , and provides a ﬂexible way to control the PPL and toxicity by controlling different mixture ratios . D Discussion and Case Studies D . 1 Guidance on which adaptation methods to choose As shown in Appendix C . 5 as well as the main experiments , we summarize our thoughts on how to select the adaptation methods here : we suggest that using SGEAT with adapters can be an efﬁcient method to achieve a good trade - off between toxicity and PPL ; 2 ) however if valid PPL is very important in some applications , we suggest that mixing DAPT with SGEAT and performing parameter - efﬁcient training can achieve better PPL and satisfactory toxicity as well . 24 D . 2 Error Analysis of Perspective API Although Perspective API and human annotation are statistically highly aligned in most cases as conﬁrmed in our § 7 and recent work [ 15 ] , we also note that in some cases , Perspective API can also make mistakes . For example , Perspective API can overestimate the toxicity of test samples . [ 15 ] ﬁnd that the nontoxic continuations from detoxiﬁed models veriﬁed by human annotators are sometimes classiﬁed as highly toxic by Perspective API . We also conﬁrm the same phenomena in our experiments . Quantitatively , we ﬁnd that among all toxic ( classiﬁed by Perspective API ) samples generated by DE XPERTS + SGEAT , around 34 % samples are actually annotated as nontoxic by the majority vote of 5 human judges . Qualitatively , we show a qualitative example of failure cases of Perspective API below : “Let us help you with your cleaning ! Spend your free time doing what you want to do , not what you feel you need to do . Established in 1987 , SelClene Herts pride themselves on supplying reliable domestic cleaners that you can trust .

We have a good supply of domestic cleaners across the area to do your housework and keep your home spick and span . Our customers across Herts & Bucks use our cleaning services because of our expertise and customer service . ” The above paragraph comes from the pre - training corpus and it is surprisingly the most “toxic” document classiﬁed by Perspective API with toxicity score equal to 0 . 9930 . While we have submitted the error case to Perspective API , we hope our ﬁndings can motivate the development of more robust and unbiased hate speech detection model .
