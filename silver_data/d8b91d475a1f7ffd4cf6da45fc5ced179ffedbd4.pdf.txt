Hyponatremia has been associated with a worse outcome in several pathologies , including cancer , in which the leading cause of this electrolyte alteration is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis . The aim of this study was to analyze in vitro the effects of low extracellular [ Na + ] in cancer progression . Materials and methods We used a previously validated experimental model of chronic hyponatremia to characterize the effects of low extracellular [ Na + ] in different human cancer cell lines : pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PANC - 1 ) , neuroblastoma ( SK - N - AS , SH - SY5Y ) , colorectal adenocarcinoma ( HCT - 8 ) , chronic myeloid leukemia ( K562 ) . Results Our results demonstrate a direct relationship between low [ Na + ] , reduced cell adhesion and increased invasion and proliferation in all cell lines tested . Accordingly , the number of tumor colonies grown in soft agar and the expression of collagenases type IV ( metalloproteinases 2 and 9 ) were markedly higher in cancer cells exposed to reduced extracellular [ Na + ] . Gene analysis showed an upregulation of molecular pathways involved in oxidative stress ( heme oxygenase 1 ) and in proliferation and invasion ( RhoA , ROCK - 1 , ROCK - 2 ) . The activation of RhoA / ROCK pathway was paralleled by a deregulation of the cytoskeleton - associated proteins , resulting in the promotion of actin cytoskeletal remodeling and cell invasion . Conclusions Overall , our data demonstrate for the ﬁ rst time that low [ Na + ] promotes cancer progression in vitro , thus suggesting that hyponatremia is not a simple bystander of disease severity in cancer . Keywords Low sodium [ Na + ] ● Tumor invasion ● Human cancer cells ● Gene expression ● Carcinogenesis Introduction Hyponatremia , de ﬁ ned by a serum sodium concentration [ Na + ] < 135 mEq / L , is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients , occurring in up to 30 % of cases [ 1 , 2 ] . Even when chronic and mild ( serum [ Na + ] 130 – 134 mEq / L ) , hyponatremia may cause neurological symptoms [ 3 ] and bone loss [ 4 , 5 ] . Moreover , it has been extensively reported that low serum [ Na + ] is associated with a poor outcome and increased mortality in several medical conditions [ 6 – 12 ] . Hyponatremia is caused by an underlying tumor - related condition in about 14 % of cases [ 13 ] . The incidence and prevalence of this electrolyte imbalance in cancer patients vary greatly , depending on the tumor type , clinical setting , and serum [ Na + ] threshold employed . The chronic reduc - tion of serum [ Na + ] in oncologic patients is mainly sec - ondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis ( SIAD ) . In this context , SIAD is most commonly due to ectopic vasopressin ( AVP ) secretion , or to stimulation of AVP secretion or potentiation of its effects by antitumoral drugs or palliative medications [ 14 – 18 ] . However , other underlying conditions , such as pain , nausea , or routine hospital treatments ( e . g . , hydration with large amounts of * Alessandro Peri alessandro . peri @ uni ﬁ . it 1 Pituitary Diseases and Sodium Alterations Unit , AOU Careggi , 50139 Florence , Italy 2 Endocrinology , Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ” Mario Serio ” , University of Florence , AOU Careggi , 50139 Florence , Italy 3 Gastroenterology , Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences “ Mario Serio ” , University of Florence , AOU Careggi , 50139 Florence , Italy Supplementary information The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s12020 - 019 - 02135 - 0 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . 1234567890 ( ) ; , : 1234567890 ( ) ; , : intravenous ﬂ uids in association with chemotherapy ) , may cause hyponatremia , contributing to disease complexity . There is evidence that hyponatremia represents a nega - tive independent prognostic factor in oncologic patients . Low serum [ Na + ] has been associated with poor progression - free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 19 , 20 ] , renal cell carcinoma [ 21 , 22 ] , gastrointestinal cancers [ 23 , 24 ] , lymphoma [ 25 ] , mesothelioma [ 26 ] , and small cell lung cancer [ 27 , 28 ] . On the other hand , the correction of serum [ Na + ] may have a favorable effect on clinical outcome . With regard to this issue , we have demonstrated by a meta - analysis that the improvement of serum [ Na + ] is associated with a reduction of the overall mortality rate in hyponatremic patients [ 29 ] . Even in patients with extensive and terminal tumor disease , the early recognition and prompt correction of reduced [ Na + ] could prevent clinical complications and improve survival [ 30 ] . Conversely , failure to normalize low serum [ Na + ] following initiation of chemotherapy represents a negative prognostic factor [ 31 ] . Based on these data , the use of hyponatremia as a biomarker for identifying high - risk individuals for lung cancer has been proposed [ 32 ] . Cancer - related hyponatremia may also adversely affect the response to chemotherapy [ 22 , 33 ] . Recent evidence shows that it correlates with a poor outcome in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with everolimus , and that the on - treatment normalization of serum [ Na + ] is associated with improved OS and PFS [ 34 ] . Similarly , serum [ Na + ] normal - ization independently improves OS and PFS in patients with advanced lung cancer treated with ﬁ rst - line drugs [ 35 ] . Whether hyponatremia is a mere marker of disease severity or contributes itself to cancer progression is an important issue that remains to be clearly elucidated [ 36 ] . Analyses of small cohorts of hyponatremic inpatients sug - gested that low serum [ Na + ] is little more than a surrogate for an underlying pathophysiologic condition , rather than being an independent detrimental factor [ 37 ] . We have previously demonstrated that low extracellular [ Na + ] is able to alter homeostatic cell functions in vitro , such as vitality , invasion , migration , and cytoskeletal organization [ 5 , 38 ] . The aim of the present study was to verify whether reduced extracellular [ Na + ] is able to affect the proliferation and inva - sive potential of different human tumor cell lines and , if so , to clarify the cellular pathways involved in these alterations . Materials and methods Cell cultures PANC - 1 , SK - N - AS , SH - SY5Y , HCT8 , and K562 human cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , L - glutamine , and antibiotics ( 50 U / mL penicillin , 50 μ g / mL streptomycin ) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere ( 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air ) . All the reagents for cell culture were from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . To test the effects of low extracellular [ Na + ] on cancer cell lines , growth media with different [ Na + ] using a 2X DMEM sodium and glucose free medium ( PAA M - medical , Milan , Italy ) were prepared , as previously described [ 38 ] . The reference [ Na + ] for these cells is 153 mM , i . e . , the concentration contained in DMEM . Osmolality was maintained constant ( 307 . 8 mOsm / Kg ) , by adding mannitol to the standard medium , while a mixture of distilled water , 0 . 9 mM NaH2PO4 , 44 mM NaHCO3 , 25 mM glucose , and appropriate amounts of NaCl was added to reach the desired [ Na + ] : 141 , 127 , 115 , or 90 mM . The cell medium was also supplemented with 2 mM gluta - mine , 50 IU / mL penicillin , 50 mM μ g / mL streptomycin , and 10 % FBS . In the experimental protocol , extracellular [ Na + ] was progressively lowered by daily medium changes , in order to adapt cells to [ Na + ] variations . Then , cells were cultured at the target [ Na + ] at 37 °C in a fully humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere , containing 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 , for 7 days before experiments were performed . Analysis of cell proliferation and viability After 7 days of growth in the selected medium , cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted twice using a hemocytometer . Viability and proliferation of cells grown in suspension ( K562 ) was assessed by using Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( Dojindo Molecular Technologies , Rockville , USA ) , whereas in adherent cells was evaluated by using MTT ( Promega corp . Madison , WI ) . Ten thousand cells per well were seeded in 96 well plates and , after an overnight incubation , WST - 8 and MTT were reduced by dehy - drogenases in cells to give a colored product ( formazan ) , which is directly proportional to the number of metaboli - cally active cells . The experiments were run according to manufacturer ’ s protocol , and luminescence ( 450 and 570 nm ﬁ lter , respectively ) was recorded with a Wallac multiplate reader ( Perkin - Elmer , Monza , Italy ) . The results were expressed as optical density OD / well ( mean ± SE ) , normalized vs control . The experiments were performed in eight wells / sample and at least twice . Adhesion assay Cell adhesion was tested by using Rose Bengal staining ( Sigma - Aldrich S . r . l . Milan , Italy ) . After 7 days at the desired [ Na + ] , cells were trypsinized and seeded in 96 - well plates ( 10 4 cells / well ) . After an overnight incubation , cells 474 Endocrine ( 2020 ) 67 : 473 – 484 were incubated with Rose Bengal Stain ( 0 . 25 % in PBS , pH 7 . 3 ) for 5 min at room temperature . The stain was then removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and incu - bated for 30 min at 4 °C with an ethanol / PBS 1 : 1 solution . The stain intensity was evaluated by spectrophotometer ( Perkin - Elmer , Monza , Italy ) at the wavelength of 560 nm . Results were expressed as mean value ± SE of OD for eight replicates / sample normalized vs control . Invasion assay Cancer cell invasive migration was assessed by a standard Transwell invasion system using polycarbonate ﬁ lter inserts ( 8 - μ m pore size ) ( Corning ® Costar ® Transwell ® cell culture inserts , New York , USA ) , which were coated with BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix ( BD Becton , Dick - inson and Company , New Jersey , US ) 0 . 3 % for 1 h at 37 °C . The upper chambers were seeded with human cancer cell lines ( 1 × 10 6 cells / ml in 100 μ l of serum - free media ) for migration to lower chamber with serum - added media . Inserts were incubated at 37 °C overnight and after 24 h they were stained with Crystal Violet , and migrated cells were observed under the microscope . Finally , migrated cells into the lower side of the insert were decolored with an Extraction Buffer and the dye mixture was measured by spectrophotometer ( Perkin - Elmer , Monza , Italy ) at the Optical Density ( OD ) of 560 nm . Soft agar assay Soft agar assay was used in order to analyze the anchorage - independent growth of cancer cells by preparing a multilayer plate . The bottom layer was obtained mixing 1 ml of pre - warmed 2X culture medium and 1 ml of 1 % noble autoclaved agar . Once the lower layer of agar had solidi ﬁ ed , the upper layer was prepared by mixing 1 ml of 2X culture medium at different [ Na + ] , 1 ml of 0 . 6 % noble autoclaved agar and 50 , 000 cells / plate . The experiments were performed in six - well plates and the time required for adequate colony for - mation was set around 21 days , because it varies for each cell line . Finally , the number of colonies in each well was counted by using a light microscope . Results represent the summary of three different experiments and ﬁ elds . RNA isolation and quantitative RT - PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted by using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad USA ) with DNAse treat - ment , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions , and its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically with NanoDrop ND - 1000 ( NanoDrop Technologies ) . RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using “ TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents ” with random hexamers ( Applied Biosystems Inc . , Foster City , CA , USA ) . The reaction pro ﬁ le was 10 min at 25 °C , 30 min at 48 °C , and 5 min at 95 °C and genes of interest were quantitatively analyzed by real - time RT - PCR by using pre - developed TaqMan ® Assays . The probes were Assay - On - Demand products ( Applied Biosystems Inc . , Foster City , CA , USA ) for HMOX1 ( Hs01110250 ) ; ( Hs00174103 _ m1 ) , ROCK - 1 ( Hs 00178463 _ m1 ) , ROCK - 2 ( Hs00153074 _ m1 ) and RHOA , ( Hs00357608 _ m1 ) . The mRNA quantitation was based on the comparative Ct ( for cycle threshold ) method and nor - malized to glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase RNA expression ( GAPDH , Hs99999905 _ m1 ) . Results were expressed as target mRNA fold increase compared with control . All measurements were carried out in triplicates and at least two independent experiments were performed . Western blot analysis Cell lysates ( 40 μ g of proteins ) were fractionated by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred onto PVDF ( Immobilon , Billerica , Millipore , MA , USA ) . Proteins were detected by incubating primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C , followed by the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( 1 : 2000 ) , 1 h at room temperature . Blots were developed with the enhanced chemilumines - cence detection system ECL ( Immobilon , Billerica , Milli - pore , MA , USA ) and analyzed with a Bio - Rad ChemiDoc Imaging System ( Biorad , California , Stati Uniti ) for che - miluminescent image acquisition . The Actin Reorganization Antibody Sampler Kit ( Cell Signalling # 9967 ) was used for the detection of the following antibodies : rabbit monoclonal anti - Co ﬁ lin ( 5175 ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - Phospho - Co ﬁ lin ( Ser3 ) ( 3313 ) , anti - Ezrin Antibody ( 3142 ) , Rabbit mono - clonal anti - VASP ( 3132 ) , and the secondary antibody anti - rabbit IgG , HRP - linked antibody ( 7074 ) . In addition , the rabbit monoclonal HMOX - 1 ( ab52947 , Abcam , Cambridge , Regno Unito ) was used . Through ImageJ Software images of the proteins of interest were quanti ﬁ ed and normalized vs GAPDH ( G8795 , Sigma - Aldrich , S . r . l . Milan , Italy ) that was used as the housekeeping protein . Zymography Supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 × g at 4 °C . To each sample ( 45 μ l ) 5 μ l of sample buffer ( 4 % SDS , 100 mM Tris HCl at pH 6 . 8 , 20 % glycerol , and 0 . 01 % blue bromophenol ) without beta - mercapto - ethanol was added . Samples were separated in a 12 . 5 acrylamide gel containing 0 . 1 % gelatin . Gels were washed twice for 30 min with 2 % Triton X - 100 , then for 30 min in the reaction buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl at pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 ) , and ﬁ nally incubated overnight at 37 °C in the same buffer . Endocrine ( 2020 ) 67 : 473 – 484 475 Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R - 250 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Milan , Italy ) . Visible light bands related to enzymatic digestion of gelatin by MMP2 and MMP9 become evident against the dark background . Densitometry was undertaken by using Image Lab software and results were normalized vs cell number / sample .

We found that in low [ Na + ] cell proliferation was dose - dependently increased in all different cell lines that were used in the study . In K562 , SH - SY5Y , and SK - N - AS cells the increase was already statistically signi ﬁ cant at a [ Na + ] of 141 mM vs 153 mM , e . g . , a 7 . 8 % [ Na + ] reduction . As described in the “ Materials and meth - ods ” section , 153 mM is the normal [ Na + ] for all the cells used in the study . In PANC - 1 cells a signi ﬁ cant increase of cell proliferation was observed starting from a [ Na + ] of 127 mM ( 17 % [ Na + ] reduction ) , whereas in HCT8 cells the difference was signi ﬁ cant starting from 115 mM ( 25 % [ Na + ] reduction , Fig . 1a ) . Cell adhesion was evaluated by Rose Bengal staining and was found to be reduced in a stepwise fashion ( Fig . 1b ) . It was already signi ﬁ cantly reduced at a [ Na + ] of 141 mM vs 153 mM in all cell lines ( Fig . 1b ) . Cell invasion Cancer cells increased their ability to cross matrigel - coated membranes in cell invasion assays when cultured in low [ Na + ] ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In particular , a signi ﬁ cant increase was already observed at a [ Na + ] of 141 mM in SK - N - AS cells and of 127 mM in HCT8 and PANC - 1 cells , whereas in K562 and in SH - SY5Y cells the increase became signi ﬁ cant at 115 mM . The invasiveness of transforming cells was con ﬁ rmed by a zymography assay , which analyzed the activity of col - lagenases type 4 ( e . g . , MMP2 and MMP9 ) . As shown in Fig . 2b , there was a general trend to an increased enzymatic activity in reduced [ Na + ] compared with normal [ Na + ] , with a signi ﬁ cant difference at very low [ Na + ] ( 115 – 90 mM ) .

When different experiments from each cell line were pooled together , it was observed that the number of colonies signi ﬁ cantly increased starting from a [ Na + ] of 127 mM in K562 and HCT8 cells and from 115 mM in SH - SY5Y , PANC - 1 , and SK - N - AS cells ( Fig . 3b ) .

In Fig . 4c a quantitative analysis from different experiments performed in each cell line is shown . ROCK1 / ROCK2 / RhoA pathway RhoA , ROCK1 , and ROCK2 are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and in the promotion of actin poly - merization via co ﬁ lin phosphorylation . Stress - induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling events lead to cell detachment and cancer progression [ 40 ] . As shown in Fig . 5 , in all cancer cell lines that were tested enhanced RHOA , ROCK1 , and ROCK2 gene expression was found in low [ Na + ] , although with cell line - and gene - speci ﬁ c differences . The dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by a number of actin binding proteins , and among them co ﬁ lin , VASP ( for vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) , ezrin and moesin . Low [ Na + ] induced a general trend to an increase of co ﬁ lin / P - co ﬁ lin in cancer cells compared with cells maintained in normal [ Na + ] ( Fig . 6 ) . In agreement with these results , also VASP , ezrin and , when detectable , moesin expression was increased in low [ Na + ] ( Fig . 7 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Discussion Several epidemiological data described an association between chronic hyponatraemia and a worse prognosis in oncologic patients , but to date there is no clear evidence of a direct correlation between this electrolyte imbalance and an effect on tumor biology . In this study , we demonstrated , for the ﬁ rst time , that the reduction of extracellular [ Na + ] is able to alter the homeostasis of different human cancer cell lines ( e . g . , a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line , K562 , an - 6 4 14 24 34 0 1 2 3 4 A 153mM 127mM 115mM 90mM [ Na + ] P A N C - 1 P - COFILIN COFILIN H C T 8 COFILIN P - COFILIN K 562 COFILIN P - COFILIN S K - N - A S COFILIN P - COFILIN S H - S Y 5 Y COFILIN P - COFILIN R e l a (cid:2) v e p r o t e i n s e x p r e ss i o n ( f o l d i n c r e a s e v s 153 m M ) - 1 4 9 14 0 1 2 3 * - 5 0 5 10 15 * * Ac(cid:2)ve Coﬁlin B 153mM 127mM 115mM 90mM [ Na ] Fig . 6 Co ﬁ lin and P - co ﬁ lin protein expression in reduced extracellular [ Na + ] . a Western Blot analysis showing the total co ﬁ lin and P - co ﬁ lin ( inactivated ) expression . b Densitometric analysis showing the active fraction of total co ﬁ lin ( co ﬁ lin / P - co ﬁ lin ) .

( * p < 0 . 05 vs 153 mM ) Endocrine ( 2020 ) 67 : 473 – 484 481 ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line , HCT8 , a pancreatic cancer cell line , PANC - 1 , and two neuroblastoma cell lines , SH - SY5Y and SK - N - AS ) . In particular , cells cultured in low [ Na + ] showed an increased proliferation rate and reduced cell adhesion compared with the normal [ Na + ] for these cells ( 153 mM ) . An increase in proliferation was also present for small variations in [ Na + ] ( 10 – 20 % ) , and , therefore , it might be also clinically signi ﬁ cant . Further - more , cells grown in reduced [ Na + ] were able to form more colonies in the absence of a solid substrate , as assessed by soft agar assay . Therefore , low [ Na + ] ampli ﬁ es the ability of cells to grow in an anchorage - independent manner , which is per se a hallmark of cancer cells . Cell invasion was also evaluated and a greater ability to invade matrigel - coated ﬁ lters was observed in the presence of reduced [ Na + ] . This ﬁ nding was con ﬁ rmed by the increased activity of MMP2 and MMP9 , as assessed by zymography assay . Because these properties are indicators of a more malignant behavior , these results indicate that low extra - cellular [ Na + ] increases tumorigenicity , at least in the can - cer cell lines that were used in this study . An intracellular pathway known to exert a crucial role in the regulation of cell proliferation and motility is the RhoA / ROCK pathway . RhoA is a small GTPase coupled to transmembrane receptors , which plays a role as a molecular switch for actin reorganization and cytoskeletal remodeling . It acts through several effectors , among which the two isoforms of the Rho - associated coiled - coil containing kinase , ROCK1 and ROCK2 , and determines the phos - phorylation of actin cytoskeleton - associated proteins , such as co ﬁ lin [ 41 ] , the ERM ( for ezrin , radixin and moesin ) proteins [ 42 ] and ENA / VASP [ 43 ] . In particular , the phosphorylation of co ﬁ lin induces its inactivation , thus promoting the formation of actin ﬁ laments from actin monomers . On the other hand , phosphorylated ERM pro - teins and ENA / VASP activate and favor the elongation of lamellipodial actin - barbed ends and ﬁ lopodia ﬁ laments . The deregulation of RhoA / ROCK pathway was demon - strated in several human cancers [ 44 – 48 ] . The enhanced ROCK signaling could facilitate cell transformation for tumor cell survival and growth , invasion and metastatiza - tion , as shown for instance in a peritoneal tumor dis - semination model [ 49 ] and in squamous carcinoma cells [ 50 ] . An association between high ROCK expression in neuroblastoma and a poor prognosis was also demonstrated , thus making RhoA effectors a possible therapeutic target for this tumor [ 46 ] . We therefore analyzed the expression of RhoA , ROCK1 and ROCK2 in our in vitro models . We demonstrated a signi ﬁ cant upregulation of gene expression in cells maintained in low [ Na + ] compared with normal [ Na + ] . The activation of this intracellular pathway was con ﬁ rmed by the modulation of downstream actin cytoskeleton - associated proteins : the inactivation of co ﬁ lin that we observed results in the inhibition of actin ﬁ laments depolymerization , whereas ezrin contributes to micro ﬁ la - ments remodeling , change of cell morphology and forma - tion of based membrane protrusions for cell motility and invasion . Previous in vitro observations reported that ROCK activation in mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarci - noma cells is associated with increased invasive growth into a three - dimensional matrix [ 51 ] , and that the inhibition of ROCK activity induces SH - SY5Y and SK - N - AS differ - entiation and suppression of migration and invasion . Accordingly , the down - regulation of RhoA / ROCK signal - ing in vivo reduces the growth of established neuroblastoma xenograft tumors in murine models [ 46 ] . Our data con ﬁ rm the importance of this pathway in tumor progression in TUBULIN 153mM 127mM 115mM 90mM VASP EZRIN [ Na + ] P A N C - 1 TUBULIN VASP EZRIN MOESIN H C T 8 TUBULIN VASP EZRIN K 562 TUBULIN VASP EZRIN S K - N - A S TUBULIN EZRIN MOESIN S H - S Y 5 Y VASP Fig . 7 VASP , ezrin and moesin expression in reduced extracellular [ Na + ] . Western Blot analysis shows the upregulation of VASP , ezrin and moesin expression in low sodium 482 Endocrine ( 2020 ) 67 : 473 – 484 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and neuroblastoma cells , and support its involvement in the cell biology of colon adenocarcinoma and chronic myeloid leukemia , too . Overall , sodium balance appears to represent a key modulator of RhoA / ROCK activity , and of actin cytoske - leton rearrangement , thus regulating cell proliferation , adhesion , and invasiveness . In this view , we can hypothe - size that chronic hyponatremia could directly contribute to cancer progression by affecting Rho - associated intracellular signaling , and potentially amplifying a molecular system already deregulated in several cancers . The reduction of extracellular [ Na + ] increases oxidative stress in different cell models , independently of the reduc - tion of extracellular osmolality . This determines a pertur - bation of several cellular functions , i . e . , proliferation , adhesion , and invasion [ 38 , 39 , 52 ] . It is now widely accepted that the three steps of carcinogenesis ( initiation , promotion , and progression ) , as well as the resistance to treatment , are strongly affected by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and anti - oxidant defenses [ 53 , 54 ] . Cellular processes controlled by oxidative stress include growth and proliferation , cell shape changes and migration , membrane transport and exocytosis / endocytosis , hormone signaling , excitability , autophagy , necrosis , and apoptosis . It is interesting to note that the deregulation of all of these functions represents a hallmark of cancer [ 53 , 55 ] . In the present study , we demonstrated that low extracellular [ Na + ] increases the expression of HMOX - 1 in all cancer cell lines tested , con ﬁ rming previous results in neuroblastoma cells [ 38 ] . Besides the mutagenic / carcinogenic potential of ROS due to their capability to damage DNA , thus inducing genomic instability and / or transcriptional errors [ 56 ] , free radicals are able to activate several pro - survival and pro - metastatic pathways . Accord - ingly , the increase of their content in cancer cells is asso - ciated with local growth and invasiveness , thus resulting in the development of distant metastases and poor survival in patients [ 55 ] . Hence , in our model the increase of intracel - lular oxidative stress induced by low extracellular [ Na + ] may represent the molecular basis of RhoA / ROCK activa - tion , increased cell proliferation , and invasiveness . Inter - estingly , in agreement with our results , increased osteoclastogenic activity of murine osteoclast precursors in low [ Na + ] , together with the upregulation of the oxidative stress pathway , had been previously reported [ 39 ] . Overall , our results show for the ﬁ rst time that low [ Na + ] alters cancer cell homeostasis and promote tumor progres - sion in vitro , through the upregulation of RhoA - associated signaling and HMOX - 1 . Admittedly , the data regarding cell proliferation , adhesion , and invasiveness were more solid than those regarding the intracellular pathways involved . However , this is not completely surprising , if we consider ( i ) the presence of a complex intracellular network that regulates the relationship between signaling molecules , and ( ii ) the heterogeneity of the different cell models used in this study . Noticeably , our data are consistent with the reported worse outcome of oncologic patients affected by chronic hyponatremia , con ﬁ rming this electrolyte disorder as an independent prognostic factor . Further in vitro and in vivo studies will be necessary , in order to clarify if the prompt correction of sodium imbalance should be considered an integral part of the oncologic therapeutic strategy .
