Rajesh Krishnan 1 , † & Debanjan Sarkar 1 , 2 Polyurethanes ( PUs ) are composed of soft and hard segments , and segmental interactions induce biphasic morphologies which can in ﬂ uence endothelial cell ( EC ) organization by regulating cell – matrix and cell – cell interactions . In this study , we explored this effect using poly ( caprolactone ) ( PCL ) - based PU , where the soft segment was composed of PCL and the hard segment was composed of hexamethylene diisocyanate ( HDI ) and L - tyrosine - based dipeptide ( DTH ) . The composition of the PUs was varied by altering the PCL molecular weight and correspondingly , different phase morphologies were observed . Organization and functional state of ECs on these PUs showed that composition and phase morphology of PU have a signi ﬁ cant effect on cellular response . The ECs formed an organized network with cord - like structures which resulted in interconnected loops when soft and hard segment fractions were phase - separated . VE - cadherin ( for cell – cell adherence ) and vinculin ( for cell – matrix focal adhesion ) localized at the tip of intercon - necting cells in the tube structures indicated synchronized cell – cell and cell – matrix interactions . Keywords : Endothelial Cells ; Polyurethanes ; Phase Morphology ; Network . INNOVATION Controlling endothelial cell ( EC ) organization into a network structure is crucial for regenerative vascularization . We envisioned that solid - state biphasic morphology of polyurethanes ( PUs ) can provide matrix guid - ance to ECs for reorganization into networks as PU phases , originates at micro and nanoscale dimensions comparable to length scale at which cell interacts . Our results demonstrate that molecular engineering of PU segmental composition creates distinct phases which act as domains and interact with ECs for organization into networks . Molecular composition of PU segments modulates PU phases either in segregated or mixed morphology . Biphasic morphology provides matrix - mediated cues through physicochemical and mechanical signals to ECs for organiza - tion into endothelial networks . Th is approach is diff erent from current matrix - mediated EC organization where either nanotopography or immobilized cell - adhesive ligands are used to regulate the functional state of cells . Nanostructured phases of matrix provide precise control of cellular fates which are otherwise not predictable from macroscopic matrix properties . INTRODUCTION Segmental thermoplastic PUs are widely used as biomaterials due to their wide - ranging physicochemical and mechanical properties as well as good biocompatibility 1 . Conventionally PUs are designed as non - degradable biomaterial for various biomedical applications , e . g . breast implants , pacemaker leads , catheters , prosthetic valve leafl ets and vascular graft s 2 – 4 . In parallel to non - degradable PUs , recent developments in biodegradable and biocompatible PUs have demonstrated the utility of PUs for regenerative tissue engineering and drug delivery applications 5 , 6 . Th rough appropriate choice of chemistries and compositions for PU segments , degradability as well as physicochemical and mechanical properties of PUs can be tailored according to the applications 7 . Both for non - degradable and degradable PUs , interaction between cells and PU matrix is a key determinant for evaluating the biological response of these materials . ECs play a major role in vascular applications , and therefore understanding the cell – matrix interactions between EC and PUs is crucial for appropriate utilization of PUs ; mainly these interactions on degradable PUs can elucidate the angiogenic and vasculogenic response of cells to promote vascularization . Structurally PUs are composed of alternating soft segments ( SS ) and hard segments ( HS ) , where SS are designed from polyester or polyether diols ( e . g . poly ( caprolactone ) ( PCL ) , poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) , polyglycolic acid ( PGA ) , poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) ) and HS are designed from di - isocyanate and diol / diamine chain extenders 5 , 8 – 11 . Variation in segmental structure and its correlation to PU properties have been investigated for several PUs 12 , 13 . However , the eff ect of these structural variations on EC response has not been examined systematically to underline the structure – function correlations . From a functional perspective , endothelialization of PU ( essentially non - degradable ) graft s has been studied to explore the suitability of these implants 14 , and similarly , degradable PUs has also been used for tissue regeneration as three - dimensional ( 3D ) scaff olds in the form of electrospun fi bers , patches and porous scaff olds 15 – 17 . Particularly , biodegradable PUs are used to promote vascularization in bone tissue - engineering and cardiovascular applications 18 , 19 .

ARTICLE 2 TECHNOLOGY l VOLUME 3 • NUMBER 4 • DECEMBER 2015 © World Scientific Publishing Co . / Imperial College Press do not underline how the molecular structure of PU influences EC behavior by delineating the PU segmental composition . Since cell – matrix interactions are intricately related to material composition , segmental structure of PU will regulate EC response , and understanding this correla - tion can provide important guidelines to regulate vascularization in PU scaff olds . Th is is important because PUs exhibit biphasic morphology due to intra - and inter - segmental interactions , and recent studies have shown this morphology as ab important material characteristic to regulate ECs 20 and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) 21 . Th us , our aim is to delineate the role of PU segmental composition and phase morphology in EC organiza - tion and identify the infl uence of these features on EC network formation . In this study , we therefore varied the segmental composition of L - tyrosine - based PUs designed with PCL as the SS and analyzed the EC response to induce vascular network formation as a function of PU com - position . L - tyrosine - based PUs have been developed as a degradable and biocompatible biomaterial , where the HS is designed from aliphatic diiso - cyanate and L - tyrosine - based dipeptide serves as the chain extender 11 , 22 . Specifi cally , we varied PU composition by altering the relative contribution of SS and HS with diff erent molecular weights of PCL in SS and examined the resultant morphology of PUs . EC responses on these PUs matrices were analyzed in terms of cellular morphology and their ability to organize into network structures . Th is study should provide a basis for the design of segmental PUs for vascularization applications in regenerative tissue engineering and defi ne the structure – function relationship . METHODS PU synthesis and phase morphology characterization Segmental PUs from PCL , hexamethylene diisocyanate ( HDI ) and desamino tyrosine tyrosyl hexyl ester ( DTH ) of diff erent molecular weights were synthesized by a two - step polycondensation reaction using dimethyl formamide as the solvent . Composition of the PUs was varied by using PCL with molecular weights of 530 , 1 , 250 and 2 , 000 to obtain PUs with increasing fractions of SS ( i . e . decreasing fraction of HS ) , as shown in Fig . 1 . Phase morphology of the PUs and the control polymers were examined from phase - mapping images obtained from atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) performed in tapping mode . Wide - angle X - ray scat - tering was performed to analyze relative interaction between segments . Additionally , dynamic oscillatory shear rheology was performed at two temperatures ( 60 ° C and 100 ° C ) to measure the frequency - dependent change in elastic modulus ( G ′ ) , viscous modulus ( G ″ ) and complex viscosity ( η * ) . Matrix stiff ness was determined from elastic modulus ( G ′ ) from oscillatory frequency sweep at 37 ° C and 1 Rad / s . Details of the polymer synthesis and phase characterizations are described in the Supplementary Information section . EC interaction with PU To analyze the interaction of ECs with PUs and the control surface , cell adherence and cell viability were measured . Cell – matrix interactions on diff erent surfaces were analyzed at low cell density to avoid cell – cell contact by measuring cell surface area and cell shape . Furthermore , cytoskeletal organization and cell – matrix focal adhesion were assessed from fl uorescently stained F - actin and vinculin . Details of these experi - ments are provided described in the Supplementary Information section . EC network characterization Network formation by ECs on diff erent substrates was characterized with two diff erent cell densities , and the kinetics on network formation was analyzed at two time points . Network structures formed by ECs were analyzed from bright - fi eld images and were characterized by examining tube length , junctional points and closed - loop structures . In addition , the cell – matrix interactions and cell – cell interactions in EC networks characterized from immunostaining of F - actin ( for cytoskeletal organiza - tion ) , vinculin ( for focal adhesion ) and VE - cadherin ( for cel – cell adhe - sion ) . Localization of cell – matrix focal adhesions and cell – cell adhesion complexes were analyzed from vinculin and VE - cadherin fl uorescence and expressed as the intensity ratio ( with respect to major and minor axis of the cells ) .

ARTICLE 3 TECHNOLOGY l VOLUME 3 • NUMBER 4 • DECEMBER 2015 © World Scientific Publishing Co . / Imperial College Press RESULTS PU structure and morphology Th e structures of PCL - based PUs are shown in Fig . 1a , where PCL forms the SS and the HS is composed of HDI and an L - tyrosine - based dipeptide ( DTH ) . Since the PUs are composed with 1 : 1 molar ratio of SS and HS , PU composition was varied by altering the SS with three diff erent molecular weights of PCL , i . e . 530 , 1 , 250 and 2 , 000 and HDI – DTH as the HS . Th us , PUs with increasing PCL molecular weight possess decreasing HS fractions . We used three PUs based on PCL with molecular weights of 530 , 1 , 250 and 2 , 000 to alter the segmental composition ( Fig . 1b ) , which shows HS fraction in PUs decrease with increases in PCL molecular weight . Variation in PU segmental composition is expected to infl uence cellular response as the polymer segments induce diff erent morphologies depending on the extent of phase mixing versus segregation based on the inter - and intra - segmental interactions . Morphologically , HS domains act as physical crosslinks between the SS due to H - bonding ( and polar interactions ) between urethane links and due to aromatic π – π interactions between DTH segments . Furthermore , interaction between carbonyl groups of PCL SS and urethane linkages control phase mixing or segrega - tion between PU segments . Th erefore , we analyzed PU morphology of using complimentary analysis . Th e AFM analysis of phase structure of three PUs along with pure SS ( PCL ) and HS ( HDI – DTH ) as control polymers is shown in Fig . 2a . Although all the PUs comprised two segments , the phase image of PCL1250 – HDI – DTH showed two distinct phases with regular periodic appearance of the phases ( inset image showing regular phase defl ections ) , whereas the other two PUs showed a relatively homogeneous phase ( inset images showing no phase defl ections ) . When the HS fraction was high and SS fraction was low , the two phases tended to associate through intersegmental interaction . As the HS fraction was reduced below a certain level , two phases were predominantly segregated . In this study , we observed that PCL1250 – HDI – DTH with a HS fraction 0 . 39 displayed this behavior . A further decrease in the HS fraction results in phase mixing , as observed in PCL2000 – HDI – DTH . Nevertheless , it is important to note that even in phase - mixed morphology , the residual content of the segment with a higher fraction can remain a separated phase aft er phase - mixing . Th is phase behavior can be explained by segmental interactions where a lower molecular weight of PCL inhibits SS to form separate domains due to their inability to crystallize , leading to enhanced interaction with HS through urethane and carbonyl interactions 13 , 23 , 24 . With an increase in PCL molecular weight , two phases segregated as separate domains as observed in PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , but further increases in molecular weight induced a phase - mixed homogeneous structure as decreased HS fractions are unable to form separate domains as crosslinking units . Th ese results are in accordance with the thermal and spectroscopic analysis of phase morphology of L - tyrosine - based PCL – PUs as well as similar polyurethanes 12 , 13 . To support the AFM characterization data , we performed wide - angle X - ray diff raction ( WAXD ) of PUs and the control polymers ( Fig . 2b ) . Pure PCL showed sharp peaks due to crystalline characters while pure HDI – DTH showed semicrystalline amorphous peaks , whereas all the PUs were essentially amorphous . In PUs , SS packing was hindered by hard segments , as PCL with a molecular weight of 2 , 000 or less fails to crystallize in PU 24 . Th e presence of an amorphous halo in PUs around 20 ° further indicates that non - crystalline mesogenic structure from tyrosine units , similar to tyrosine polyarylates 25 , form separate domains but induce a diff erent level of interaction with SS in PUs . Rheological characterization of PU morphology Dynamic oscillatory rheological analysis is an important tool to analyze the mechano - morphological character of PUs . Two reference temperatures below the polymer melting temperature were selected for this analysis , where 60 ° C and 100 ° C are around and greater than pure PCL melting temperature , respectively ( Fig . 3a ) . At 60 ° C , when PCL segments have minimal fl ow character , all PUs show well - separated elastic ( G ′ ) and viscous ( G ″ ) moduli ( where G ′ > G ″ ) , indicating the presence of two domains , but this do not necessarily provide the morphological distribution of phases . With an increase in temperature to 100 ° C , G ′ and G ″ become equal over the entire frequency for both PCL530 – HDI – DTH Figure 2 Morphology of PUs of segmental PUs and control polymers .

Whereas at this temperature , PCL1250 – HDI – DTH showed distinguish - able G ′ and G ″ ( with G ′ > G ″ ) as short - range orders are preserved . Mor - phologically , this indicates that two segments of PCL1250 – HDI – DTH are predominantly separate where HS exists as separate domains upon heating . Strong intra - segmental interactions through urethane linkages of hard segments were conserved at higher temperatures as the PCL segment was phase - separated from the HS domain and the mobile SS did not disrupt the short - range order . In contrast , when phases were predominantly mixed , the mobile SS ( at higher temperaturea ) prevented the HS from forming separate domains in two other PUs . In comparison , homogeneous PCL ( MW : 1 , 250 ) at both temperatures displayed the rheology of a viscous liquid with both moduli lower than that of segmental PUs ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , indicating the absence of HS domains . Frequency sweep analysis was further validated from frequency - dependent change in complex viscosity ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . At both temperatures , PCL1250 – HDI – DTH showed similar frequency dependency indicating phase - separated morphology , whereas the other two PUs showed less frequency dependency at higher temperatures , indicating that two phases in PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH are relatively mixed . Similar rheological results from thermoplastic PUs and PCL - based PUs have been reported to explain the PU phase morphology 26 , 27 . Rheological analyses of viscoelastic character of PUs are in agreement with AFM and X - ray characterization , collectively indicating that L - tyrosine - based PCL – PUs show predominant phase - separation when SS and HS fractions are comparable , but become relatively phase - mixed when either of the two segments is dominant . While rheological studies at higher temperatures ( 60 ° C and 100 ° C ) are useful to delineate PU phase morphology , we performed the rheology of the PUs at 37 ° C to analyze the stiff ness of these substrates ( Fig . 3b ) . Elastic modulus ( G ′ ) of PU ( PCL1250 – HDI – DTH ) was signifi cantly higher than pure PCL ( MW : 1250 ) as HS act as physical crosslinks . As the HS content decreased ( with increasing SS PCL molecular weight ) , PUs exhibited higher elastic moduli which indicates that stiff ness of PUs are controlled by PCL SS . Th is trend was also supported from tensile mechanical properties of the PUs measured at room temperature ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . At 37 ° C , PU stiff ness increases with PCL molecular weight , a trend which reverses at higher temperatures ( i . e . above the melting temperature of SS ) . Th us , G ′ at 37 ° C and 1 Rad / s is more representative of matrix rigidity measurement 28 .

ARTICLE 5 TECHNOLOGY l VOLUME 3 • NUMBER 4 • DECEMBER 2015 © World Scientific Publishing Co . / Imperial College Press on PU substrates and controlled polymers analyzed aft er 24 hours ( Supple - mentary Fig . 3a ) showed cell adherence on PU surfaces have no signifi cant diff erence with respect to pure PCL and HDI – DTH substrates . Th is was an expected behavior as PCL – PUs exhibits similar hydrophobicity compared to controls 12 . Furthermore , viability of the adhered cells ( normalized with a control glass coverslip which showed 95 % cell viability ) was not aff ected on PU surfaces ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Th e ability of ECs to sense the varied PU segmental composition and corresponding phase morphology was analyzed from the F - actin ( red stain ) and focal adhesion ( vinculin ; green stain ) organization ( Fig . 4a ) and from cell size and shape ( Fig . 4b , c ) . F - actin organization of ECs on a pure PCL surface showed the peripheral localization of stress fi bers , whereas a pure HDI – DTH surface showed mainly diff used actin , indicating that ECs form stronger adhesive interaction on a PCL surface with distinct focal adhesions compared to a HDI – DTH surface . As a result , cells on the PCL surface were signifi cantly greater in surface area compared to that on HDI – DTH , although the cell shape were essentially similar ( same circularity index ) with pseudopod extensions . Compared to these homogeneous sur - faces , cells on the PU surface showed more pronounced actin fibers when the HS fraction was high ( in PCL530 – HDI – DTH ) . Fur - ther , as the HS content de - creased , actin expression was gradually diff used . In terms of PU phase morphology , EC response indicates that cells form distinct actin fibers when HS are accessible as separate domains . Although PCL530 – HDI – DTH is pre - dominantly phase - mixed , cells can sense the residual HS which are present as separate domains , whereas in PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , cells can respond to phase - separated HS domains . In contrast , in phase - mixed PCL2000 – HDI – DTH , no HS were present as isolated domains , which likely pre - vented actin organization . On a PCL530 – HDI – DTH surface , focal adhesions mirrored F - actin , whereas on PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , more pronounced focal ad - hesions were localized at the extended protrusion . Similar behavior was observed from MSCs , where cells tend to ex - hibit a low level of expression of vinculin on a PU surface with a higher HS fraction 21 . Th is shows EC focal adhesion on a PU surface is dependent on the availability of free ac - cessible HS domains , which was signifi cantly higher on PCL1250 – HDI – DTH com - pared to the other two PU surfaces . However , it is critical to note that ECs on PCL1250 – HDI – DTH show less actin fi bers but more pronounced focal adhesions . Analysis of cell area shows that ECs on PU surfaces were signifi cantly smaller compared to those on a PCL surface , although no signifi cant diff erence was observed between the three PU surfaces . Th ere was no signifi cant diff erence in cell shape on diff erent PU surfaces , although on PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , the shape of ECs were more random ( as observed from the wide range of circularity index ) compared to other PU surfaces . From both cell size and shape , it is evident that ECs prefer to interact with HS domains . When HS are present as separate domains , cells can identify these domains , whereas in phase - mixed surfaces , morphology cells search for these domains using pseudopod - like extensions , similar to the behavior observed in hydrophobically modifi ed polymers 29 . Interestingly , in spite of increased stiff ness ( at physiological temperature ) of PU substrates compared to PCL , ECs neither showed enhanced actin stress fi bers and focal adhesions nor increased cell spreading on PUs . Similar responses of ECs were observed when PU stiff ness increased with increasing SS Figure 4 Morphology of ECs due to cell – matrix interactions on surface of PU and control polymers .

While most studies have shown that ECs form defi ned actin stress fi bers on stiff er matrices 30 , these results indicate that the segmental composition and phase morphology of PUs play a major and more dominating role ( compared to matrix stiff ness ) in regulating EC responses . Endothelial network formation on PU surface To analyze how segmental composition and phase morphology of PU surface influence vascular network like structure , we seeded ECs at a high density ( ~ 25 , 000 cell / cm 2 , corresponding to complete confluence ) to enable effective cell – cell interaction . We analyzed network structures at two time points ( 8 and 24 hours ) to understand the time - dependent response on the network formation . EC organiza - tion on different substrates is shown in Fig . 5a . On the homogeneous PCL and HDI – DTH substrate , ECs initially organized to cord - like structures , but these structures gradually collapse ; on PCL , cells formed monolayer over time , whereas on HDI – DTH , cells aggregated into lumps . Among PU surfaces , ECs formed network structures on PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH but not on PCL2000 – HDI – DTH . Both on PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , Figure 5 EC response on different surface at high cell density .

ARTICLE 7 TECHNOLOGY l VOLUME 3 • NUMBER 4 • DECEMBER 2015 © World Scientific Publishing Co . / Imperial College Press cells initially showed preliminary networks which over time matured into highly interconnected closed network structures . In contrast , ECs on PCL2000 – HDI – DTH formed transient cord - like extensions at the initial time point which ultimately collapsed over time . EC network characterizations ( Fig . 5b ) show that the tube lengths and three - point branching junctions of EC networks on PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH are significantly greater than on both homo - geneous substrates as well as PCL2000 – HDI – DTH . Moreover , EC cords on these two PU surfaces were interconnected into closed - loop structures indicating stable assembly of ECs into networks . Kinetically , on both of these PU surfaces , the network structures matured over time , indicating that stabilization effect of PU matrices during the course of experiments . Thus , well - defined EC network structures on PU surfaces , compared to homogeneous ones , indicate that PU segmental composition plays a significant role in EC assembly . These networks were well organized when the HS fraction was either greater than the SS fraction or above a certain level . Additionally , networks on PCL1250 – HDI – DTH were more robust compared to that on PCL530 – HDI – DTH as EC tube length , the number of three - point junctions and closed - loops structures were significantly greater on PCL1250 – HDI – DTH . This indicates not only that the HS fraction is critical for EC assembly , but PU phase morphology plays a significant role . Morphologically phase - separated PUs ( i . e . PCL1250 – HDI – DTH ) provided better cues for ECs to form stable and well - organized networks compared to phase - mixed ones even when the HS fraction was high . This behavior also showed that increased stiffness of the PU substrate may not necessarily enhance EC network structures , as PCL2000 – HDI – DTH in spite of having the highest level of stiffness did not induce EC networks and ECs formed better networks on PUs with surface stiffness of 50 – 65 kPa . These analyses show that ECs can form networks on substrate of lesser stiffness if PU phase morphology is favorable for network formation .

ARTICLE 8 TECHNOLOGY l VOLUME 3 • NUMBER 4 • DECEMBER 2015 © World Scientific Publishing Co . / Imperial College Press Since EC networks are also dependent on cell density 31 , we analyzed networks on these surfaces with a lower cell density of 12 , 000 cells / cm 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . At this density , ECs at the initial time point formed similar network - like structures on all the surfaces , but only on PCL1250 – HDI – DTH these structures were stabilized with tubes and three - point junctions , which were signifi cantly greater than other control groups but not when compared to PCL530 – HDI – DTH ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . This response on PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH showed that ECs are able to organize into networks due to PU segmental composition and phase morphology , and follows a similar trend as observed with higher cell density . While ECs on PCL530 – HDI – DTH formed well - defi ned structures at high cell density , at lower cell density , cells did not organize into tubes but showed isolated three - point junctions . Th is behavior indicated that phase - separated PU segments provide more effi cient cues to ECs at low cell density as observed in PCL1250 – HDI – DTH compared to phase - mixed PCL530 – HDI – DTH , even though the latter had a greater HS fraction . However , the number of three - point junctions on PCL530 – HDI – DTH were signifi cantly higher compared to that on pure PCL and statistically similar to PCL1250 – HDI – DTH . Th is showed that residual HS fraction on PCL530 – HDI – DTH can provide localized cues to initiate junctions , albeit insuffi cient , to form tube structures with fewer cells . Overall , EC responses on PU surfaces indicate interplay between cell density and the biphasic character of PU surfaces . HS of PU can guide ECs to form networks depending on the cell density where segregated domains are more eff ective compared to phase - mixed ones . Cell organization in endothelial network on PU surface To understand how ECs are organized within network - like structures through synchronized cell – matrix and cell – cell adhesion , we immu - nostained the cells on PU surfaces to visualize cytoskeletal organization ( through F - actin staining ) and cell – matrix adhesion ( through vinculin staining ) and cell – cell adhesion ( through VE - cadherin staining ) . Th e ECs stained for F - actin ( red ) and vinculin ( green ) are shown in Fig . 6a and the ECs stained for F - actin ( red ) and VE - cadherin ( green ) are shown in Fig . 6b . Both actin and vinculin expressions of ECs on surfaces where cells did not form networks ( i . e . homogeneous PCL and PCL2000 – HDI – DTH ) were signifi cantly diff erent from the ones ( i . e . PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH ) where cells formed well organized networks . When ECs formed network - like structures , vinculin expression was reduced and predominantly localized at the tip of interconnecting cells in the cord - like structures . F - actin fi bers were pointed toward these vinculin structures and arranged in a paral - lel pattern along the major axis of the cell and ended in the vinculin structures . Similarly , VE - cadherin was mainly localized in the cell – cell junctions at the tip of interconnecting cells , indicating that vinculin and VE - cadherin associate to form the interconnected network . When ECs failed to organize into network structures , F - actin fi bers were organized along the cell periphery and vinculin structures were distributed throughout the cell boundary , suggesting that ECs lacked a directional preference to form cord - like structures . VE - cadherin also formed stable cell – cell adhesion throughout the cellular periph - ery without any preferential localization . We quantifi ed the spatial localization of vinculin ( Fig . 6a ) and VE - cadherin ( Fig . 6b ) with respect to the cell periphery by measuring the fl uorescence intensity ratio along the major axis to minor axis . ECs on PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , where the cells formed networks , exhibited a relatively higher intensity ratio compared to other groups where ECs predominantly formed a monolayer . Th is analysis demonstrated that vinculin and VE - cadherin associate at the tip of interconnecting cells on PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , leading to network structures . When ECs formed networks , both cell – matrix and cell – cell adhesion complexes were preferentially localized at the tip of interconnecting cells ( in the network ) . Consequently , vinculin and VE - cadherin were less pronounced in the lateral direction . While forming networks , these junctions are known to remodel through association of vinculin and VE - cadherin , leading to vascular structures 32 , 33 . Presence of segregated PU phases with separated HS domains provided cues for ECs to organize into networks through recruitment on cell – cell and cell – matrix adhesion complexes at the junction of intercon - necting cells . For homogeneous PCL and PCL2000 – HDI – DTH , the lack of well - segregated HS domain inhibited ECs from organizing into networks , and induced a monolayer where cell – matrix and cell – cell adhesion were organized throughout cell periphery . Lack of preferential localization of these junctions on these surfaces induced stable cell – cell adhesion and focal adhesions with matrix leading to a monolayer . Overall , this analysis showed that PU composition and morphology regulates cell – matrix and cell – cell adhesion to guide ECs for network formation . Phase - separated HS domains present localized matrix cues for EC network structures which were not observed on other surfaces . DISCUSSIONS Th e aim of this study was to analyze the eff ect of segmental composition and phase morphology of biphasic PUs on EC organization . SS and HS of PUs can present unique phase morphologies for controlling cell – matrix interactions which in turn infl uences cell – cell interactions . Since EC network formation is synchronized through cell – matrix and cell – cell interactions , we expected that PU composition and phase morphology will infl uence EC network . PU phase morphology with relative aggregation or separation of segments has been characterized for several PUs with different techniques using thermal , spectroscopic ( e . g . FTIR ) and microscopic ( e . g . AFM ) . Inter - and intra - segmental interactions induce phase mor - phology with characteristic surface features from nano to microscale dimensions which are at a comparable length scale for cell – matrix interactions . Essentially , these interactions are coupled with cell – cell adhesion to form multicellular structures . In this work , we explored PCL - based PUs composed of HDI as the diisocyanate and L - tyrosine - based DTH as the chain extender and varied the composition of segments by altering the molecular weight of PCL . When the HS frac - tions were above a certain level compared to the SS fraction , urethane linkages within the HS interacted to self - assemble and HS segregated as separate domains as observed from AFM analysis . Th ese domains acted as physical crosslinks between SS which was analyzed from the shear rheological characterizations . In our study , PCL1250 – HDI – DTH exhibited predominantly phase - separated morphology . Compared to PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , when segmental composition is altered by increasing or decreasing the HS fraction respectively in PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL2000 – HDI – DTH , phase - mixed PUs were formed through intersegmental interactions induced between ester functionalities of PCL SS and urethane linkages of HS . Analysis of phase morphology through AFM and WAXD corroborated the oscillatory shear rheology data and these results were in agreement with similar analysis from PCL - based PUs . ECs can recognize physicochemical features , e . g . presence of cell – adhesive ligands as well as mechanical character , e . g . stiff ness of synthetic matrix to exhibit diff erent levels of cellular organization 31 , 34 . Furthermore , these features show a synergistic eff ect on ECs which are oft en regulated by the presence of soluble factors , e . g . VEGF 31 . Th is study investigated the eff ect of PU composition and phase morphol - ogy with diff erent cell densities . At a lower cell density when cell – cell contact was inhibited , ECs exhibited defi ned F - actin fi bers with greater HS fractions , and showed gradually diff used F - actin with decreased HS fractions . However , focal adhesions were more prominent when HS 1540012 . indd 8 1540012 . indd 8 10 / 29 / 2015 5 : 15 : 03 PM 10 / 29 / 2015 5 : 15 : 03 PM T ec hno l ogy D o w n l o a d e d fr o m www . w o r l d s c i e n ti f i c . c o m by A nn i e P hu a on 12 / 01 / 15 .

ARTICLE 9 TECHNOLOGY l VOLUME 3 • NUMBER 4 • DECEMBER 2015 © World Scientific Publishing Co . / Imperial College Press formed phase - separation in PCL1250 – HDI – DTH . PU HS induced a diff erential character on synthetic matrix , and above a certain fraction , these HS provided guidance cues to ECs . Th ese cues played a similar role for ECs to form networks as cell density increased . ECs formed well - defi ned networks which were interconnected to closed loops on PU surfaces with increasing HS fractions , but the frequency of these networks became dominant as the HS formed phase - separated domains . In the context of PU substrate stiff ness , EC organization was hindered as stiff ness was increased . Further , at lower stiff ness , when HS domains were accessible to cells , ECs formed more organized structures . It is likely that PCL2000 – HDI – DTH exhibited an excessively stiff er matrix and lacked segregated domains , both of which collectively inhibited EC organization . On the other hand , the two other PUs provided optimal stiff ness . Even at lower matrix stiff ness , morphology of PU phases can guide ECs to form defi ned networks which indicates the critical role of PU domain morphology and its predominance over substrate rigidity to guide the cells . Collectively , this data showed that the state of ECs and their ability to form network structures on PU surfaces is regulated by the segmental composition and phase morphology , and not exclusively controlled by substrate rigidity . Studies have demonstrated that the physicochemical character of synthetic matrices infl uences EC organization , e . g . balanced hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the matrix 35 or chemical functionalization with cell RGD or laminin - derived peptide regulating EC network structures 36 , 37 . Similarly , ECs require optimal matrix stiffness to form network structures 31 . In this context , it likely that HS of PU , which is polar and hydrophobic in nature and mechanically more rigid due to its crystalline nature , provided localized matrix cues to ECs for network structures . For PU substrates , phase morphology and the micro to nanoscale structure of domains are more important modulators of EC response . Th us , macroscopic matrix stiff ness is not necessarily the only parameter to predict EC organization . Further analysis of the network structures showed that both VE - cadherin and vinculin were recruited at the tip of interconnecting cells when ECs formed network structures . In contrast , VE - cadherin and vinculin were localized throughout the cell periphery without any pref - erential localization when ECs failed to formed networks . VE - cadherin associated cell – cell interactions are crucial to forming and stabilizing vascular networks , and are oft en associated with vinculin at the junction of interconnecting cells forming cord - like structures in the network 33 , 38 . Th ese junctional complexes are remodeled to form stable EC networks and are distinguished from stable cell – cell adhesion in EC monolayers . In PCL530 – HDI – DTH and PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , segmental composition and phase morphology induced similar eff ect on ECs to remodel these junctional complexes at the tip of interconnecting cells , thereby providing directional guidance to form networks . Phase - separated HS of PU engaged ECs through a cross - talk of cell – matrix and cell – cell adhesion . EC response on PU – gold nanocomposite has also shown segregated domains promot - ing cell adhesion and proliferation with actin – stress fi ber formation 20 . As these results outlined the structure – function relationship between PU surfaces and EC organization , the functional role of PU phases in terms physicochemical and mechanical eff ects needs to be elucidated . Specifi cally , it is crucial to analyze if the HS as a phase segregated domain optimized interactions with ECs through surface polarity and specifi c protein adsorption or through the matrix elasticity . In conjunction , it also remains to be seen how PU surfaces activate or downregulates cell signaling pathways in ECs . CONCLUSIONS In summary , we have shown that biodegradable PCL - based PUs with an L - tyrosine - based chain extender induced diff erent levels of interaction with ECs . Th e SS and HS of PUs exhibit phase - mixed or phase - separated morphology depending on the segmental interactions . Results showed that ECs form well - defi ned network structures on phase - separated PUs compared to phase - mixed PUs . Segregated domains of the PU matrix can guide ECs to synchronize cell – cell and cell – matrix interactions for network formations . Most interestingly , ECs can form networks on matrices with lower stiff ness if PU phase morphology favors EC organization . Th rough modulation of segmental composition and cor - responding phase morphology , it is possible to control the functional state and behavior of ECs on PU substrates . Th is study provides crucial guidelines for designing segmental PUs in applications where interaction with ECs plays a major role , e . g . in vascular graft s or vascularization tissue - engineering scaff olds .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION PU synthesis and substrate preparation Polycaprolactone ( PCL ) with average molecular weights of 530 and 1 , 250 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich ( MO ) and PCL with an aver - age molecular weight of 2 , 000 was purchased from Polysciences ( PA ) . All other chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich ( MO ) . Glass coverslips of 18 mm in diameter were purchased from Fisher Scientifi c ( PA ) . PCL – polyurethanes ( PUs ) with three diff erent molecular weights of PCL were synthesized through the poly - condensation reaction between PCL , aliphatic diisocyanate ( HDI ) and desaminotyrosine tyrosyl hexyl ester ( DTH ) in a 1 : 2 : 1 molar ratio via a two - step polym - erization reaction , according to the literature S1 . DTH was synthesized by carbodiimide coupling between hexyl ester of L - tyrosine and desaminotyrosine S2 . PCL forms the “soft ” segment ( SS ) and HDI – DTH forms the “hard” segment ( HS ) of the PUs . Consequently , PCL – PUs ( PCL530 - , PCL1250 - , and PCL2000 – HDI – DTH ) resulted in a biphasic material structure . Increasing PCL molecular weight increased the SS fraction of the PUs and decreased the HS content ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . PU with only HS from HDI and DTH was synthesized via condensation polymerization of HDI and DTH in a 1 : 1 molar ratio at 80°C for 12 hours in dimethyl formamide ( DMF ) , and the polymer was precipitated in anhydrous diethyl ether and purifi ed by reprecipita - tion from the DMF solution . For substrate preparation , PCL , three PCL – PUs and HDI – DTH were dissolved in chloroform at 1 wt % . Th e polymers were coated on clean glass coverslips through the dip - coating method followed by evaporation of the solvent at room temperature . Polymer - coated coverslips were dried in vacuum at room temperature for 24 hours before experiments . Characterization of polymers The phase structures of PCL , PCL530 – HDI – DTH , PCL1250 – HDI – DTH , PCL2000 – HDI – DTH and HDI – DTH were characterized by wide - angle X - ray diffraction ( WAXD ) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and dynamic oscillatory rheology . WAXD was performed with Rigaku Ultima IV X - ray diffractometer by scanning from 5 ° to 30 ° at a speed of 0 . 5 ° per minute on solid polymer samples . AFM ( Nanosurf easyScan 2 , NanoScience Instruments Inc . , DC ) was performed on polymer - coated coverslips within a 0 . 5 - μm 2 surface area using an Applied NanoStructures ACL - A ( aluminum - coated ) tip set to tap - ping mode .

Dynamic rheology performed oscillatory shear experiments with Bohlin Instruments CVO Rheometer for bulk polymer at 60°C and 100°C . Frequency sweep measurements were performed within angular frequencies of 0 . 01 to 10 Rad / s . Amplitude sweep was performed for each polymer to determine a constant strain or stress value within the linear viscoelastic range . Rheological measurements used parallel plate geometry with a diameter of 10 mm with a gap of 0 . 5 mm . All measurements were carried out under an aluminum shell to cover the samples so as to prevent thermo - oxidative degradation . Elastic modulus ( G ′ ) , viscous modulus ( G ″ ) and complex modulus ( η * ) were plotted against angular frequency . The tensile mechanical properties of the films were meas - ured by Instron Tensile Testing Machine with a load cell of 100 N and cross - head speed of 100 mm / min at room temperature . The sample dimension was 20 mm × 6 mm × ~ 0 . 3 mm with free length of 10 mm . Culture of ECs and interaction with PU substrate Human endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) purchased from Promocell were cultured in EC media ( Endothelial Cell Growth Medium , from Promocell ) at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . All experiments were performed with cells between passages 4 – 6 . PCL , PCL – PUs and HDI – DTH coated coverslips were sterilized under UV light overnight and washed thrice with sterile PBS to avoid contamination . Polymer - coated coverslips were placed in a 12 - well plate as well as the blank glass coverslips as the control . To study single - cell interaction with matrix , 1 mL of cell culture medium containing approximately 5 , 000 cells were added in each well to maintain low cell density and to avoid cell – cell contact . Cell adhesion and viability assay were performed for all the polymers . Twenty - four hours aft er cell seeding , the supernatant media was aspirated to remove non - adherent and dead cells . Aft er replacing with fresh cell media , cell adhesion assay was analyzed by manually counting the cell numbers from 10 randomly selected areas in each well at 10 × magnifi cation under a bright - fi eld microscope . Cell viability measurement was performed using the Alamar Blue assay to assess the viability of the adhered cells . Alamar Blue ( 10 % ) was mixed with cell media to add into each well followed by incubation at 37 ° C for 4 hours , and the intensity of fl uorescence was measured at 585 nm . 1540012 . indd 11 1540012 . indd 11 10 / 29 / 2015 5 : 15 : 04 PM 10 / 29 / 2015 5 : 15 : 04 PM T ec hno l ogy D o w n l o a d e d fr o m www . w o r l d s c i e n ti f i c . c o m by A nn i e P hu a on 12 / 01 / 15 .

Aft er 24 hours , cell organization and alignment were assessed from bright - fi eld images obtained at 10 × from fi ve randomly selected fi elds of view in each well ( of three wells , i . e . a total of 15 images ) for each group . Th e tube length , number of junction points and number of closed loops were analyzed with NIS - Elements soft ware . Tube length was measured from the length of continuous tube structures , junction points were considered at the nodes where three point branching was observed , and closed loops were defi ned closed structures formed by the tubes . To study the cytoskeletal organization as well as the distribution and localization of cell – matrix and cell – cell interactions , HUVECs were stained with the Actin Cytoskeleton / Focal Adhesion Staining Kit ( FAK100 , Millipore ) , anti - VE cadherin monoclonal antibody ( MABT134 , Millipore ) and FITC - conjugated secondary antibody ( 12 - 506 , Millipore ) . Anti VE - cadherin was diluted in 1 % w / v BSA in PBS at 1 : 500 concentra - tion and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature . Aft er washing thrice with a wash buff er made by 0 . 05 % tween - 20 in PBS , the FITC - conjugated secondary antibody was diluted at 1 : 500 concentration and incubated together with TRITC Phalloidin for 1 hour at room temperature . All samples were washed thrice with the tween - 20 wash buff er before imag - ing . Fluorescent images were taken with Nikon Eclipse Ti - U microscope under 10× and magnifi ed on localized areas using NIS element soft ware for visualization of the stains . Representative images from the fl uorescent staining are shown . Both vinculin and VE - cadherin staining images were quantifi ed in terms of their intensity ratio . Th e intensity ratio was defi ned as the average intensity at the two tips at the elongated axis of a cell over that at the short axis of the same cell . Th e elongated axis is perpendicular to the short axis . Approximately 20 cells were analyzed from each group to measure the fl uorescence intensity ratio . Data analysis All experiments were performed in triplicates . Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of the mean . Data were analyzed using the student’s t - test for pairwise comparison and a one - way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test for determining diff erences from multiple comparisons in a group . Diff erences were considered statistically signifi cant with p ≤ 0 . 05 and p values are denoted as * p < 0 . 05 , # p < 0 . 01 , and § p < 0 . 001 . REFERENCES S1 .
