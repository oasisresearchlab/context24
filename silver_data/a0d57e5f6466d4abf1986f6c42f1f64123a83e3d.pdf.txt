Jones 3 & Michael P . Sheetz 2 , 5 The turnover of integrin receptors is critical for cell migration and adhesion dynamics . Here we ﬁnd that force development at integrins regulates adaptor protein recruitment and endocytosis . Using mobile RGD ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) ligands on supported lipid membranes ( RGD membranes ) and rigid RGD ligands on glass ( RGD - glass ) , we ﬁnd that matrix force - dependent integrin signals block endocytosis . Dab2 , an adaptor protein of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , is not recruited to activated integrin - beta3 clusters on RGD - glass ; however , it is recruited to integrin - mediated adhesions on RGD membranes . Further , when force generation is inhibited on RGD - glass , Dab2 binds to integrin - beta3 clusters . Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 excludes other adhesion - related adaptor proteins , such as talin . The clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery combines with Dab2 to facilitate the endocytosis of RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters . From these observations , we propose that loss of traction force on ligand - bound integrin - beta3 causes recruitment of Dab2 / clathrin , resulting in endocytosis of integrins .

C ell migration on matrices and the organization of the extracellular matrices by cells involve mechanical as well as biochemical communication between activated integrins and the cytoskeleton 1 , 2 . An important component of that communication is the regulation of integrin dynamics , such as localization and turnover 3 . Outside - in integrin activation by extracellular ligand binding initially triggers a series of biochemical reactions , such as the recruitment of adaptor proteins and ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) polymerization that ultimately establishes micrometre - sized adhesion clusters 4 , 5 . Force development on extracellular matrices plays a positive role in the maturation of signal transduction at integrin - mediated adhesions 6 , 7 . However , the mechanism of how matrix forces regulate integrin downregulation and endocytosis remains unclear . We previously described how micropatterned RGD mem - branes allowed us to modulate the matrix force development in the extracellular microenvironment 5 , 8 , 9 . One distinct feature of mobile RGD membranes is their two - dimensional ﬂuidity . Because of the absence of lateral force on ligands , mobile RGD membranes make it possible to investigate force - dependent and force - independent aspects of integrin signalling . More importantly , microfabricated diffusion barriers ( RGD - glass ) embedded in the mobile RGD membranes can serve as sites of force generation when the cell adheres and pulls on matrix ligands . Although the chemistry of ligand activation remains unchanged , micropartitioned RGD membranes enable spatial control of ligand mobility and enable the investigation of spatiotemporal signalling events at activated integrin clusters in a force - sensitive manner . In the absence of matrix force , we ﬁnd that integrin - beta3 activation triggers time - dependent recruitment of different classes of adaptor proteins . Initially , classical adhesion - related molecules ( such as talin ) bind to activated integrin receptors 5 . If no force develops on the cell – matrix interface , then activated RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters fail to form mature adhesions and adhesion - related molecules are replaced by endocytic adaptor proteins , including Dab2 . Results Dab2 binds to integrin - beta3 clusters on RGD membranes . Ligand - activated integrin - beta3 cytoplasmic tails bound to a number of cytoplasmic proteins with different cellular functions , such as talin and Dab2 ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Talin directly bound to integrin - beta3 at focal adhesion sites and was well documented in matrix adhesion formation 12 . Dab2 was an adaptor protein for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . However , the regulation mechanism for Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 in the live cell has not been deﬁned . When the distribution of Dab2 was analysed , Dab2 was not found at integrin - beta3 - mediated focal adhesion sites formed on RGD - glass ( Fig . 1a ) . However , when cells adhered on mobile RGD membranes , Dab2 was found at a subpopulation of RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . RGD membranes were formed with biotinylated lipids in the bilayer that were linked to biotin - RGD by ﬂuorescent neutravidin and the diffusion coefﬁcient of the neutravidin was B 2 m m 2 s (cid:2) 1 ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) , as measured by ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching 5 . RGD ligands selectively triggered cell adhesion by activating both integrin - beta1 and beta3 ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . The activation states of integrin - beta1 and beta3 were examined by conformation - speciﬁc antibodies , 9EG7 and LIBS2 , respectively . When the cells adhered on RGD membranes , Dab2 was only recruited to activated integrin - beta3 sites , not to activated integrin - beta1 sites ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) , in agreement with previous in vitro biochemical studies 10 . Dab2 is often involved in the endocytosis of low - density lipoprotein receptor LRP6 ( refs 13 , 14 ) . However , the majority of Dab2 was instead found to be associated with integrin - beta3 when cells adhered to RGD membranes ( Supplementary Fig . 2c , d ) . In addition , we utilized two - colour structured illumination super - resolution microscopy and Pearson’s correlation analysis to validate the colocalization of Dab2 and integrin - beta3 at the 100 - nm level ( Fig . 1d , f ) . As might be expected , Pearson’s correlation analysis of RGD clusters , activated integrin - beta3 and integrin - beta3 - GFP ( green ﬂuorescent protein ) showed that they were colocalized ( Fig . 1e ) . Thus , the majority of Dab2 was associated with integrin - beta3 clusters on RGD membranes , whereas Dab2 was absent at integrin - beta3 clusters on rigid RGD - glass . To understand the dynamics of recruitment , we followed Dab2 localization during the initial stage of cell spreading on RGD membranes . RGD - integrin - beta3 clustering preceded the subsequent recruitment of Dab2 ( Fig . 1g , h and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Over time , Dab2 was concentrated at a subpopulation of integrin - beta3 clusters ( Fig . 1g ) . Similarly , Dab2 was also found at RGD clusters in various cell types on RGD membranes , including mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast ( MEF ) , REF52 , H460 , U2OS , HeLa and CHO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In addition , micropatterns of extracellular ligands by ultraviolet - based soft lithography were developed that had mobile RGD ligands in micrometre - sized domains surrounded by lines that contained immobilized RGD 15 . Dab2 was preferentially recruited to mobile RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters but not to clusters at the lines ( Fig . 1i , j ) . Integrin - beta3 clusters that formed at immobilized RGD lines developed classic focal adhesions that were interconnected by contractile F - actin ﬁbres . Thus , recruitment Figure 1 | Integrin - beta3 recruits Dab2 when the cell adheres on mobile RGD membranes .

Since RhoA - GTP levels are correlated with the level of contractility 16 , higher RhoA - GTP level would potentially suppress Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 . Using a FRET - based biosensor as a read - out of cellular contractility 8 , 17 , we found that the cellular RhoA - GTP level on RGD - glass was signiﬁcantly higher than the level on RGD membranes ( Fig . 2a , b ) . In the control cell on RGD - glass , Dab2 was not recruited to integrin - beta3 clusters . When myosin - II activity was suppressed by the ROCK inhibitor , Y27632 ( 10 m M ) , Dab2 was recruited to a subpopulation of integrin - beta3 clusters , even when the cell was plated on immobile RGD - glass ( Fig . 2c ) . Likewise , when we introduced constitutively active RhoA - Q63L or overexpressed the phosphomimetic myosin regulatory light chain MRLC T18D / S19D , Dab2 recruitment was reduced on RGD membranes as measured by Pearson’s correlation analysis ( Fig . 2d – f ) . Thus , the level of RhoA activity and myosin - II force generation correlated inversely with Dab2 recruitment at integrin - beta3 clusters . Tyrosine mutations of integrin - beta3 alter Dab2 binding . Earlier studies on the in vitro binding of Dab2 to integrin reported that two tyrosine residues in the integrin - beta3 cyto - plasmic tail regulated Dab2 binding 10 . We examined whether the mutations in mouse integrin - beta3 ( Y772 and Y784 ) could also alter the interaction between Dab2 and integrin - beta3 in live cells on RGD membranes . Speciﬁcally , we utilized CHO cells that only expressed integrin - a 5 , a V and b 1 , but not b 3 ( ref . 18 ) .

All rights reserved . When these b 3 - deﬁcient CHO cells ( CHO - a 5 b 1 ) spread on RGD membranes , Dab2 was absent at integrin - beta1 clusters ( Fig . 3a ) . However , after transient transfection of mouse integrin - beta3 - GFP , Dab2 was recruited to integrin - beta3 - GFP clusters ( Fig . 3a ) . Point mutations of mouse integrin - beta3 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues Y772 or Y784 to phenylalanine and Src inhibition by PP2 attenuated Dab2 recruitment , as measured by Pearson’s correlation analysis ( Fig . 3a , b ) . However , a small population of Dab2 was still associated with tyrosine - mutated integrin - beta3 clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , in agreement with a previous study 10 . In addition , expression of a constitutively active Src kinase mutant did not promote Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Thus , it appeared that tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin - beta3 tails is not the only factor regulating Dab2 recruitment . Dab2 excludes classical focal adhesion proteins . In the initial RGD - integrin clusters , talin was one of the key adaptor proteins that directly interacted with the integrin - beta3 cytoplasmic tail 11 , 19 ( Fig . 4b , c , 0 – 6 min ) . However , when Dab2 was bound to RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters , talin was absent ( Fig . 4b , c , 6 – 18 min ) . As the level of talin at an RGD cluster dropped , the level of Dab2 increased ( Fig . 4d , e ; line scan along the arrow in Fig . 4d ) . The exchange process between Dab2 and talin was reversible ( Fig . 4d , e and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Thus , Dab2 and talin were always mutually exclusive at sites of recruitment to RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . To determine whether other focal adhesion adaptor proteins that bind directly to integrin - beta3 , such as kindlin1 , tensin1 and ﬁlaminA 20 , 21 , were similarly excluded from Dab2 - integrin - beta3 clusters , we analysed the GFP chimeras of these proteins . Neither talin , kindlin1 , tensin1 nor ﬁlaminA associated with Dab2 to RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters on RGD membranes , as conﬁrmed by Pearson’s correlation analysis ( Fig . 4f – i and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Since talin was replaced by Dab2 at early integrin - beta3 clusters over time , we tested whether stabilization of talin at adhesions would inhibit Dab2 binding . Talin recruitment to integrins was reinforced on the rigid matrices by the Rap1 - RIAM activation 22 and local enrichment of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate 19 , 23 . However , overexpression of constitutively active Rap1 - V12 or phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase type I gamma 87 ( PIP5K g 87 ) failed to inhibit Dab2 binding to RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b , d ) . Further , overexpression of the calpain - cleavage - resistant talin - L432G mutant did not inhibit Dab2 binding to RGD clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 6c , d ) . In the absence of matrix force at the forming adhesion , activation of Rap1 , PIP5K g 87 or inhibition of talin cleavage did not inhibit the substitution of talin by Dab2 when the cells adhered to ﬂuid RGD membranes . Thus , the mobility of the integrin ligands plays the key role in modulating differential adaptor protein binding at activated integrin - beta3 . Clathrin is recruited to integrin - beta3 by Dab2 and Numb . Because Dab2 binds to integrin - beta3 through its phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domain , we tested whether other PTB - domain - containing proteins 10 , 24 such as DOK1 and LDLRAP1 ( ARH ) bound to integrin clusters in the absence of force . DOK1 - EGFP was not enriched at Dab2 - bound RGD clusters , and the ARH - EGFP localization level to RGD clusters was limited ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . However , the other PTB - domain - containing protein involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , Numb , was recruited to RGD clusters in a similar manner to Dab2 ( Supplementary Fig . 7c , d ) . Both Dab2 and Numb directly bound to integrin - beta3 cytoplasmic tails in vitro 10 . As expected , clathrin was also recruited at Dab2 - bound RGD - integrin - beta3 clusters ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Using an RNA interference approach , we examined whether Dab2 or Numb was required for clathrin recruitment at integrin - beta3 when cells adhered to RGD membranes . The knockdown efﬁciency was found to be 70 – 90 % ( Fig . 5c , d ) .

However , dual knockdown of both Dab2 and Numb effectively suppressed clathrin colocalization with RGD clusters ( Fig . 5e and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) and promoted talin colocalization with integrin - beta3 clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Thus , both Dab2 and Numb serve as adaptor proteins to recruit clathrin to integrin - beta3 clusters . In addition , we tested the functional roles of Dab2 and Numb in the migration of cells seeded on compliant ﬁbronectin - coated polydimethylsiloxane gels ( CY52 – 276 kit , stiffness 3 kPa ) . Single knockdown of Dab2 or Numb caused a decrease in cell migration speed , and dual knockdown of both Dab2 and Numb resulted yet further decrease in migration speed ( Supplementary Fig . 10a – c and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Endocytosis of RGD - integrin - beta3 cluster . These results raise the question of whether or not the binding of Dab2 causes the endocytosis of the integrin clusters and mediates adhesion turnover . Pearson’s correlation analyses revealed that clathrin localized with Dab2 , integrin - beta3 and RGD clusters when cells adhered to RGD membranes ( Figs 5b and 6a ) . Other components of clathrin - mediated endocytosis 25 , such as AP2 , epsin1 and dynamin2 , were also found at RGD clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 11a – d ) . To visualize active endocytic events , we monitored all Dab2 and clathrin puncta formed in images collected in a time - lapse format ( total track ) . We then identiﬁed a subgroup of tracks ( active track ) that exhibited a decreased intensity proﬁle over time in both the clathrin and integrin - beta3 channel ( Fig . 6b ) .

Within 30 min of observation after 3 h of adhesion formation on RGD membranes , we found that active clathrin puncta constituted B 17 % of the total ( Fig . 6c , d , total 932 tracks in six cells , and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . The durations of active endocytosis events were widely spread with a range from 2 to 25 min ( Fig . 6e ) . To further test whether the endocytosis is speciﬁc for integrin - beta3 clusters , the amount of endocytosed RGD - neutravidin was measured in the integrin - beta3 - deﬁcient CHO - a 5 b 1 cells using three - dimensional confocal microscopy . Total intensity of endocytosed RGD - neutravidin within the confocal volume 1 – 4 m m above the adhesion plane was used to quantify the endocytosis level . After 3 h of adhesion on RGD membranes , lower levels of endocytosed RGD - neutravidin were found in CHO - a 5 b 1 cells than in the same cells when integrin - beta3 - GFP was expressed ( Fig . 7a ) . Internalization of RGD - neutravidin was suppressed by knockdown of Dab2 and Numb ( Fig . 7b and Supplementary Fig . 13 ) , as well as by the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine ( 50 m M ) 26 . Other inhibitors , such as Dynasore and Pitstop2 were also examined ; however , both were not compatible in our assay because of the substantial disruption of ﬂuid bilayer structure of the entire RGD membranes . On RGD - glass , clathrin was absent at integrin - beta3 focal adhesion plaques ( Supplementary Fig . 11e ) , and endocytosed RGD - neutravidin was not observed after 3 h of adhesion formation ( Fig . 7b ) .

To determine whether endocytosis was limited to ﬁbronectin - binding domains or extended to larger lipid domains , cells were bound to supported membranes functionalized with both the ﬁbronectin fragment ( FN7 – 10 with H10 tag ) and nonspeciﬁc membrane marker , neutravidin - biotin - dextran ( 3 kD ) . Internalization of the ﬁbronectin fragment was observed , whereas most of the dextran remained extracellular ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Thus , in the absence of traction force , ﬁbronectin ( RGD ) - integrin - beta3 clusters are speciﬁcally internalized via clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Discussion Adhesion disassembly involves many different molecular pathways 11 , such as paxillin phosphorylation 27 and the removal of integrin receptors from the plasma membrane by endocytosis . In particular , endocytosis of integrin receptors plays an important role in adhesion turnover , cell migration and cancer metastasis 28 . Here we demonstrate that the loss of physical forces on ligand - bound integrins can switch downstream signalling of integrin - beta3 activation from classic focal adhesion formation to a pathway of Dab2 binding and clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Fig . 7e and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . While integrin - beta3 is activated via the same ligand chemistry , RGD - glass allows integrin - beta3 adhesion plaque assembly and activates RhoA - mediated actomyosin contractility . Dab2 and clathrin are absent at integrin - beta3 focal adhesion sites . However , the lateral mobility of the RGD ligands on the supported membranes still triggers integrin - beta3 activation but frustrates the development of force from actomyosin contractility 8 . On RGD membranes , we ﬁnd that Dab2 and other clathrin - related adaptor proteins are subsequently enriched at a subpopulation of integrin - beta3 clusters , with concomitant loss of talin and other adhesion - related adaptor proteins ( Fig . 4 ) . 0 300 600 900 1 , 200 1 , 500 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 Duration of active events ( s ) H i s t og r a m ( c oun t s ) Clathrin Clathrin Integrin - beta3 Integrin - beta3 0 50 100 150 8 , 000 10 , 000 12 , 000 14 , 000 16 , 000 18 , 000 Time ( s ) I n t eg r i n - be t a3 i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) Background Active 0 50 100 150 0 2 , 000 4 , 000 6 , 000 8 , 000 10 , 000 Time ( s ) C l a t h r i n i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) Background Active d c e b 10 s A c t i v e T o t a l 0 50 100 150 200 N u m be r o f e v en t s Ratio 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 R a t i o o f a c t i v e e v en t s a Merge Figure 6 | Endocytosis of RGD - integrin - beta3 cluster on RGD membranes .

However , a recent report based on mass spectrometry has conﬁrmed the phosphorylation of integrin - beta3 tyrosines , Y772 and Y784 , when cells adhere to a ﬁxed ﬁbronectin - coated substrate 29 . Thus , the absence of Dab2 at integrin - beta3 clusters on a ﬁxed matrix is not caused by a deﬁciency in tyrosine phosphorylation . In addition , Src is one of the tyrosine kinases that phosphorylates integrin receptors ; however , expression of constitutively active Src kinase ( Src - Y527F ) does not promote Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 on ﬁxed substrates ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) .

All rights reserved . a small population of Dab2 on RGD membranes ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation on integrin - beta3 fails to completely block Dab2 binding . Therefore , we believe that the differential recruitment of Dab2 to integrin clusters on RGD membranes versus RGD - glass is not entirely regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin - beta3 . Our observations indicate that a decrease in myosin - II contractility by Y27632 and an increase in extracellular ligand mobility can both promote Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 . Likewise , increases in myosin - II contractility and immobilization of extracellular ligand both suppress Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 clusters . In addition , a micropatterned substrate with both mobile and ﬁxed ligands directly reveals that Dab2 preferentially binds to integrin - beta3 in regions containing mobile ligands ( Fig . 1i , j ) . Thus , we suggest that the development of actomyosin contractility inhibits Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 , and the loss of cell – matrix force development is one of the key mechanisms activating Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 clusters . Previously , protein kinase C ( PKC ) and atypical PKC - dependent pathways of Dab2 and Numb binding to integrin receptors have been investigated 30 , 31 . On RGD membranes , Dab2 and Numb bind to integrin - beta3 in a similar manner and both serve as adaptor proteins to facilitate clathrin - dependent endocytosis 14 . Knockdown of both Dab2 and Numb effectively blocks clathrin localization to RGD clusters and suppresses the endocytosis of RGD - neutravidin ( Figs 5e and 7b ) . Similar decreases in RGD endocytosis in single and double knockdown cells may suggest a potential collaborative interaction of Dab2 and Numb , which remains to be further investigated . Endocytosis of RGD - neutravidin is a clathrin - dependent process , as chlor - promazine effectively suppresses the level of endocytosis ( Fig . 7b ) . In contrast to the fast endocytosis of non - adhesion - related membrane receptors , ligand - bound integrin receptors physically form strong adhesion plaques and are endocytosed at a slow rate ( Fig . 6e ) , when compared with the endocytosis rate of transferrin receptor 32 . While Dab2 / clathrin - bound puncta on integrin - RGD clusters are larger than typical diffraction - limited clathrin - coated structures , these larger puncta remain endocytically active 32 , 33 . Overall , B 17 % of Dab2 / clathrin - bound puncta were endo - cytically active within 30 min of observation when observed after 3 h of adhesion formation on RGD membranes . Internalized integrin - beta3 puncta that colocalize with RGD ligands indicate that endocytosis occurs at the basal surface of the cell over the RGD membranes , and these are found at Rab5 - containing early endosomes ( Fig . 7c , d ) . During the endocytic events ( Fig . 6b ) , the slow and persistent intensity drop in both clathrin and integrin - beta3 channels may involve other rate - limiting steps to facilitate endocytosis processes . Never - theless , the force required to extract lipid - bound RGD - neutravi - din is relatively low and previously measured as 3 . 4 – 6 . 1 pN ( ref . 34 ) . The long lifetime of Dab2 / clathrin puncta and the slower pace of integrin - beta3 endocytosis may reﬂect the generally slow turnover rate of the ligand - bound integrins . Likewise , slower endocytosis of integrin and other ligand - bound membrane receptors has also been documented elsewhere 35 – 37 . The contractility - dependent binding of Dab2 is speciﬁc for Integrin - beta3 . Dab2 and clathrin are not bound to activated integrin - beta1 clusters on RGD membranes . This indicates that the turnover of integrin - beta1 may be regulated by a different pathway 38 , and previous studies indicate that beta1 turnover is insensitive to cell matrix forces 39 . In the general context of matrix adhesion development , early adhesions are typically mediated by integrin - beta3 and then often undergo a transition to integrin - beta1 - based adhesions . This transition from beta3 to beta1 integrin is correlated with actomyosin contractility 40 . To further examine the level of integrin internalization , integrins tagged with a photo - activatable ﬂuorescent protein can be utilized to monitor the spatiotemporal reorganization of integrin receptors in a time - dependent manner 41 . A point to note for consideration and future investigation concerns the effect of matrix mechanical properties in cancer cell invasion 42 . In cases where matrix metalloproteinase activities are upregulated in metastatic cancer cells , the matrix components are locally degraded and thus become effectively mobile 43 . Thus , proteolytically released matrix will physically resemble the mobile ligands in RGD membranes used here and would activate endocytosis of integrins that would further contribute to tissue disorganization 44 . Despite identical ligand chemistry , force development at the cell – matrix interface ( RGD - glass ) reinforces talin association and inhibits Dab2 binding to integrin - beta3 . However , when matrix force development is impaired ( RGD membranes ) , Dab2 association with integrin - beta3 is enabled . The mutually exclusive pattern of Dab2 and talin binding to integrin - beta3 clusters on RGD membranes conﬁrms that the binding domains overlap in the integrin - beta3 cytoplasmic tail . Remarkably , RGD membranes allow us to directly visualize the spatiotemporal association of Dab2 and endocytosis of integrin - beta3 . While normal matrix proteins might not be as mobile as the RGD membranes , the proteolytically degraded matrices will be mobile , and our micropatterned RGD membrane system provides a demonstra - tion that differential recruitment of Dab2 to mobile sites of integrin clusters can occur at a subcellular level . In summary , we propose that mobile matrix ligands redirect conventional integrin signalling , recruit Dab2 and clathrin and ultimately trigger endocytosis of integrin - beta3 . While only 17 % of Dab2 - bound integrin - beta3 puncta go through the endocytic pathway within the 30 - min time frame we utilize , the repeated binding of Dab2 will assure eventual endocytosis . Because Dab2 and talin are mutually exclusive at integrin clusters , they provide a digital switch to re - programme integrin - related adhesion signalling as matrix compliance or force generation changes . Our results of adhesion transformation highlight a critical role of microenvironment sensing that involves both biochemical and mechanical steps to regulate signal transduction .

Fibronectin repeat III 7th to 10th domain monomer with 10 histidines ( FN7 – 10 H10 ) was puriﬁed using the method previously described 51 , and then labelled with CF680R maleimide . The lipid membrane - coated glass substrate was then assembled with an Attoﬂuor cell chamber ( Life Technologies ) or Chamlide magnetic chamber ( Live Cell Instrument , Seoul , Korea ) within the water bath at room temperature . After assembly , ligand - coated supported lipid membranes in the chamber were always kept under aqueous conditions . Micropatterned RGD lines were achieved by direct deep - ultraviolet patterning 15 . Biotin - conjugated silane ( PG2 - BNSL - 2k , Nanocs Inc . , New York , NY , USA ) or biotinylated bovine serum albumin was ﬁrst coated and immobilized on cover glass . A quartz photomask with microfabricated chromium patterns was attached on coated cover glass . Deep - ultraviolet light was used to locally remove / degrade biotinylated glass coating through the photomask ( typically 5 - min exposure ) . Biotinylated lipid membranes were then backﬁlled to cover the area where the biotinylated coating was removed . Surface densities of available biotins over both mobile and immobile areas remained equivalent ( 0 . 06 – 0 . 12 % ) . Complementary micropatterned surfaces with mobile ( biotinylated supported lipid membranes ) versus immobile ( biotinylated glass coating ) ligands were established . Further functionalization of RGD was followed by the method described above . Elastic substrate . For the cell migration assays , a soft polydimethylsiloxane ( 3kPa ) gel was prepared by 1 : 1 mixture of the CY52 – 276A / B kit ( Dow Corning ) , as previously described 52 . Brieﬂy , CY52 – 276A and CY52 – 276B were mixed in a 1 : 1 ratio , and 100 m l of silicon mixture was deposited on a glass - bottom Petri dish , spin - coated at 500r . p . m . for 45s and cured at 80 (cid:2) C for 2h . Cured silicon substrates were then treated with oxygen plasma for 15s , incubated with ﬁbronectin at the concentration of 25 m gml (cid:2) 1 for 30min at 37 (cid:2) C and then washed three times with 1 (cid:3) PBS to remove unbound ﬁbronectin . Cells were stained with 5 m M far - red DNA dye DRAQ5 ( Life Technologies ) 30h after the siRNA transfection and seeded at low conﬂuency to minimize cell – cell contacts during migration . Cells were allowed to adhere and spread on the substrate for 6h before imaging . Immunoﬂuorescence and inhibition chemicals .

ROCK inhibitor Y27632 , Src inhibitor PP2 and chlorpromazine were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St Louis , MO , USA ) . Chemicals were ﬁrst kept as a stock concentration 1 , 000 times higher than the ﬁnal concentration . Before applying to cells , chemicals were diluted 1 , 000 times into DMEM media . Microscopy . Fluorescent images were taken with an inverted spinning - disk confocal microscope ( PerkinElmer UltraVIEW VoX ) , with (cid:3) 100 oil immersion lens ( 1 . 40 numerical aperture , UPlanSApo (cid:3) 100 , Olympus ) and cooled EMCCD camera ( C9100 - 13 , Hamamatsu Photonics ) . An environmental chamber ( 37 (cid:2) C and 5 % CO 2 ) was attached to the microscope body for long - term time - lapse imaging . Two - colour structured illumination super - resolution images were taken with a Nikon N - SIM inverted microscope , with (cid:3) 100 oil immersion lens ( 1 . 49 numerical aperture , CFI Apochromat TIRF (cid:3) 100 , Nikon ) and cooled EMCCD camera ( DU - 897 , Andor ) . Fifteen images ( three directions and ﬁve phases ) were taken at each position and then reconstructed using the NIS - Elements software . FRET images of RhoA - Raichu - CR biosensor were acquired using 488 - nm laser excitation and 580 – 650 - nm emission ﬁlter . Green channel was used as the reference baseline and was monitored by 488 - nm laser excitation with 500 – 555 - nm emission ﬁlter . Cell migration was visualized with both phase contrast ( cell morphology ) and far - red ﬂuorescence ( cell nucleus ) channels on a fully automated Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with a (cid:3) 10 air objective lens . Endocytosis assay . Cells were ﬁrst re - plated on to RGD membranes to allow cell attachment and new adhesion formation . Samples with RGD membranes were maintained in 37 (cid:2) C to prevent artiﬁcial aggregation of RGD - neutravidin . Examination of the endocytic compartment started after 2h of initial adhesion , and cells were ﬁxed in 3h . Under identical acquisition parameters , endocytosed RGD - neutravidin was visualized using confocal microscopy with 500nm per section and 4 m m depth in total . In the ﬁrst hour , the RGD signal in the endocytic compartment was often too low to be observed . Three - dimensional views of the confocal images were rendered using Volocity ( PerkinElmer Inc . , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Z - stack images ( from 1 to 4 m m ) were added up and used to compare the level of endocytosis . Regions of interest within the cell and without the cell were used to quantify the internalized RGD intensity and background intensity , respectively . Data analyses . Colocalization analysis was performed with Coloc2 in ImageJ ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Region of interest within the cell adhesion footprint was selected , and Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients ( R ) were calculated between two channels without threshold . Time - lapsed intensity measurement was performed using Imaris ( Bitplane AG , Zurich , Switzerland ) . For the RhoA analysis , the FRET ratio was calculated after background subtraction in both channels 8 , 53 . Three or more independent experiments were repeatedly performed under each condition , and all samples represented biological replicates . Statistical bar graphs with the mean and error bars were plotted using Prism ( GraphPad Software Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Statistical signiﬁcance analysis was performed using Prism ( Kruskal – Wallis test ) , and P values were calculated ( * * P o 0 . 01 ; * * * P o 0 . 001 ; and * * * * P o 0 . 0001 ) .
