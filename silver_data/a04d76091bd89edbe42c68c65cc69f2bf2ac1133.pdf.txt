Chiumello . # ERS Journals Ltd 2003 . ABSTRACT : Ventilator - induced lung injury is a side - effect of mechanical ventilation . Its prevention or attenuation implies knowledge of the sequence of events that lead from mechanical stress to lung inﬂammation and stress at rupture . A literature review was undertaken which focused on the link between the mechanical forces in the diseased lung and the resulting inﬂammation / rupture . The distending force of the lung is the transpulmonary pressure . This applied force , in a homogeneous lung , is shared equally by each ﬁbre of the lung 9 s ﬁbrous skeleton . In a nonhomogeneous lung , the collapsed or consolidated regions do not strain , whereas the neighbouring ﬁbres experience excessive strain . Indeed , if the global applied force is excessive , or the ﬁbres near the diseased regions experience excessive stress / strain , biological activation and / or mechanical rupture are observed . Excessive strain activates macrophages and epithelial cells to produce interleukin - 8 . This cytokine recruits neutrophils , with consequent full - blown inﬂammation . In order to prevent initiation of ventilator - induced lung injury , transpulmonary pressure must be kept within the physiological range . The prone position may attenuate ventilator - induced lung injury by increasing the homogeneity of transpulmonary pressure distribution . Positive end - expiratory pressure may prevent ventilator - induced lung injury by keeping open the lung , thus reducing the regional stress / strain maldistribution . If the transpulmonary pressure rather than the tidal volume per kilogram of body weight is taken into account , the contradictory results of the randomised trials dealing with different strategies of mechanical ventilation may be better understood .

" We ventilated thousands of patients in this way and the only side effect was hypocapnia " was a statement made by P ONTOPPIDAN et al . [ 1 ] in the The New England Journal of Medicine in 1972 . However , since the mid - 1970s , there has been progressive recognition of the potential harm of mechanical ventilation . The recognition that the ventilatable lung in ARDS is small , and not stiff ( the baby lung concept [ 2 ] ) , made obvious the possible mechanical harm of using a high V T in a little lung , and led to concepts such as permissive hypercapnia [ 3 ] , i . e . to more gentle lung treatment . In parallel , it was recognised ex vivo [ 4 ] and in vivo [ 5 ] that , irrespective of mechanical rupture , mechanical ventilation may induce a complex biological response , with release of inﬂammatory and anti - inﬂammatory mediators . This led to the concept of biotrauma , which is widely , although not universally [ 6 ] , accepted . In the present article , the authors present their under - standing of the initial physical and biological events which trigger ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) and its clinical consequences , without intending to either provide an exhaus - tive review of full - blown VILI or preclude or invalidate other interpretations . The distending force of the lung and its distribution in healthy and diseased lung parenchyma The distending force of the lung per unit area , i . e . the pressure , is that applied to the visceral pleura . This is the transpulmonary pressure ( P L ) , which is the difference between the pressure inside the alveoli and the pleural pressure ( P pl ) . Unfortunately , in normal clinical practice , it is usual to consider the plateau or airway pressure ( P aw ) as the distending force of the lung . Under static conditions , P aw closely reﬂects the intra - alveolar pressure , which , in part , is spent to inﬂate the lung , and , in part , to inﬂate the chest wall . In a simple model that ignores blood shift , lung inﬂation is considered to be equivalent to chest wall inﬂation . The rela - tionship between P aw and P pl , which determines the P L , depends on the relative mechanical characteristics of lung and chest wall , which is convenient to express as elastance ( pressure / volume ) . The elastance of the respiratory system ( E rs ) is the P aw required to inﬂate the respiratory system to 1 L above its resting position under static conditions . Indeed , P aw equals the sum of the pressure used to inﬂate the lung ( P L ) and the one used to inﬂate the chest wall ( P pl ) : P aw ~ P L z P pl , ð 1 Þ Eur Respir J 2003 ; 22 : Suppl . 47 , 15s – 25s DOI : 10 . 1183 / 09031936 . 03 . 00021303 Printed in UK – all rights reserved Copyright # ERS Journals Ltd 2003 European Respiratory Journal ISSN 0904 - 1850 and E rs ~ E L z E w , ð 2 Þ where E L and E w are the elastances of the lung and chest wall . Accordingly , P L ~ P aw E L = E rs : ð 3 Þ Under normal static conditions , since E L is approximately the same as E w , whatever pressure is applied to the alveoli , it results in a change in P L of y 50 % ( E L / E rs = 0 . 5 ) . For many years , unfortunately , any change in E rs was attributed to E L . However , there is now consistent evidence that E w may be altered in ARDS patients [ 7 – 10 ] due either to individual patients 9 anatomical characteristics ( body size and weight ) or the nature of the disease leading to ARDS . It has been shown that abdominal pressure , which directly increases E w , is frequently altered in abdominal diseases associated with ARDS , such as peritonitis or bowel ischaemia [ 11 , 12 ] . Indeed the E L / E rs ratio , which determines the relationship between P aw and the resulting P L ( Equation 3 ) , may range in acute lung injury / ARDS from 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 or more , greatly different from the normal value of 0 . 5 . Since VILI occurs due to distension of the lung , which depends on P L , it follows that its measurement or estimation is a key issue , as , for the same applied P aw , P L and its potential harm to the lung may vary greatly between patients . Pressure transmission throughout the lung The P L is applied to the visceral pleura and has to be transmitted throughout all lung regions . The force - transmitting system is the lung 9 s ﬁbrous skeleton , which consists of two components , the axial ﬁbres , anchored to the hilum , which run along the branching airways down to the level of alveolar ducts , and the peripheral ﬁbre system , anchored to the visceral lung pleura , which penetrates centripetally into the lung down to the acini . The two systems are linked at the alveolar level by the alveolar septal ﬁbres [ 13 ] . The lung 9 s ﬁbrous skeleton consists mainly of elastin and collagen ﬁbres , which are intimately associated with each other . Other load - bearing force elements connecting to the pulmonary inter - stitium are actin and myosin microﬁlaments originating from myoﬁbroblasts . Pressure , stress / tension and strain The strict deﬁnition of stress and strain is beyond the purpose of the present article and may be found elsewhere [ 14 ] . However , in its simplest deﬁnition , in a monodimen - sional structure ( such as a string / spring pair ) , stress ( or tension ) may be deﬁned as the force per unit area which develops in a structure as a reaction to an applied external force of the same entity but opposite direction , i . e . s n = D F / D S , where s n is stress , D F change in force and D S the reference surface to which the force is applied . This internal force , cutting the structure by an ideal surface , may be resolved into three components , one of which is normal to the plane ( normal stress ) and two of which are tangential ( shear stresses ) . The deformation of the structure ( if any ) due to the applied force is called strain . In the simplest monodimen - sional structure under traction , strain is deﬁned as the ratio of the change in length of the structure ( D L ) to its length in the resting position ( L 0 ) , i . e . s = D L / L 0 , where s is strain . Indeed , stress and strain are the natural response of a structure to an applied force . In the lung , during mechanical ventilation , stress and strain are periodically changing variables characterised by maximal and minimal values ( end - inspiratory and end - expiratory PL for stress , and end - inspiratory and end - expiratory lung volume ( EELV ) for strain ) at a given frequency and amplitude ( difference between maximal and minimal value ) . When P L is applied to the visceral pleura surface by the inspiratory muscles or ventilator , this applied force , under static conditions , is equal to the sum of the forces developed within the lung parenchyma . Part of these forces are borne by the alveolar air / liquid interface , which , in the presence of surfactant , are very low up to 80 % of total lung capacity [ 15 ] , whereas the remaining forces are shared by the ﬁbre system of the lung 9 s ﬁbrous skeleton . With lack of surfactant , the liquid / air interface bears more force and conceptually works as an " added force - bearing ﬁbre system " . Indeed , each ﬁbre expe - riences a stress / tension according to the force it has to bear . In a homogeneous lung , every ﬁbre shares an equal proportion of the total force applied and develops an equal tension and equal strain . If some of the ﬁbres are destroyed ( as in emphy - sema ) , fewer ﬁbres have to share the applied force and expe - rience greater stress and strain . However , if part of the parenchyma remains collapsed during inﬂation or cannot expand , as in consolidated pneumonia , the interwoven ﬁbres in the diseased region bear the force and are in tension but do not strain . The ﬁbres connected to the not expandable region , however , have to carry a greater force load , with greater tension and distortion ( ﬁg . 1 ) . These concepts have been developed , on a theoretical background , by M EAD et al . [ 16 ] , who , in a simpliﬁed model in which the volume of the collapsed region was one tenth of the volume that this region would have occupied if not collapsed , computed that , for an applied pressure of 30 cmH 2 O , the resulting tension in the neighbouring region would have been 140 cmH 2 O . Indepen - dently of the precision of this computation , it is clear that , when the stress and strain are not homogeneously distributed , greater tension and distortion develop in some regions and the order of magnitude of ﬁbre tension may be such to lead to stress at mechanical rupture . Targets of injury As discussed above , it appears that the triggers of VILI are the mechanical forces which globally ( excessive applied P L ) or locally ( stress / strain maldistribution due to lung inhomoge - neity ) cause mechanical alterations of the lung parenchyma which range from excessive and nonphysiological strain up to stress at rupture . Indeed , the three main targets of injury are the ﬁbre systems in the extracellular matrix , alveolar cells and lung capillaries . The small airways may also be affected [ 17 , 18 ] , but have scarcely been studied and so are not discussed further . Fibre system As the most important components of the lung 9 s ﬁbrous skeleton are the collagen and elastin ﬁbres , it is appropriate to brieﬂy summarise their mechanical characteristics ( ﬁg . 2 , table 1 ) . The simplest approach to elastin / collagen interaction is to consider the elastin a spring in parallel with a folded string of collagen . The elastic behaviour of the simple unit is shown in ﬁgure 2a . When an external force is applied , the spring ( elastin ) is the force - bearing element and develops stress and strain according to its mechanical characteristics . The string ( collagen ) develops its stress when completely unfolded . Since the collagen is almost inelastic , it works as a stop - length ﬁbre , preventing further strain of the elastin / collagen unit . However , different units may have different elastic constants 16s L . GATTINONI ET AL . and different stop lengths . When connecting different units with different characteristics in series , the overall behaviour results from the contribution of the simple elements ( ﬁg . 2b and c ) . The situation is more complex when considering the network of spring / string units connected in series and parallel . Assuming a statistical density distribution of elastin / collagen mechanical characteristics , models have been developed , which describe the mechanical behaviour of the system as tested ex vivo ( ﬁg . 2d ) [ 19 , 20 ] . Considering the mechanical behaviour of the whole ﬁbre system and its tissue / air ratio , it appears that the order of magnitude of the stress at rupture is y 100 cmH 2 O . Alveolar cells Three - quarters of all lung cells ( by volume ) are located in gas exchange regions . Although type II epithelial cells are located in the alveolar corners , type I epithelial cells ( about y 90 % of the alveolar surface ) are ﬂat and wide , and the same cell may encompass , in a sandwich - like fashion , approxi - mately four endothelial cells . It is worth emphasising that , in most of the alveolar structure , type I epithelial cells share a common basal membrane with endothelial cells , suggesting mechanical coupling . The ﬁbre system and associated ﬁbroblasts as well as ﬁlaments of actin and myosin , which all contribute to mechanical support [ 21 ] , are located in the basal membrane ( extracellular matrix ) to which both the epithelial and endothelial cells are anchored via integrins . When a distending force is applied to the ﬁbre system , which primarily bears the load , all of the anchored cells have to accommodate their shape to the new surface . Obviously , there is a continuum from physiological deformation up to plasma cell break ( stress failure ) . The interaction between the mechanical deformation and the biological reaction has been extensively investigated in cell culture ( excellently reviewed in [ 22 – 28 ] ) . However , it is unlikely that the stress / strain relation - ship in cell culture is equivalent to that in vivo due to the complex architecture of the alveolar wall as well as pheno - mena such as alveolar cell unfolding at high volume [ 29 ] . Therefore , it is hard to translate lung volume changes into cell strain changes . However , despite these limitations , the present authors believe that the available data , obtained in cultures of different alveolar cells , may be considered as offering a unique perspective , which is internally consistent . As summarisedin ﬁgure 3 , thecells react to deformation , ﬁrst reinforcing the plasma membrane by recruiting intracellular lipids to the cell surface , a phenomenon called deformation - induced lipid trafﬁcking [ 30 , 31 ] . In the meantime , the " mechanosensors " , i . e . the integrins , the cytoskeleton and ion channels , transduce the mechanical signal in biochemical events , via a complicated network of signalling molecules [ 26 – 28 ] . The ﬁnal result of an " intermediate " nonphysiological strain , not such as to produce physical rupture of the alveolar wall , is the reinforcement / sealing of the plasma cell membrane [ 32 ] , as well as , via mechanosensors , upregulation of inﬂam - matory cytokines and , possibly , Ca 2 z - mediated cell contraction [ 33 ] . The results of various experiments in different cell cultures are summarised below . At a strain causing a 12 % increase in surface area , it has been shown that human macrophages , via nuclear factor - k B , produce interleukin ( IL ) - 8 [ 34 ] , a cytokine of the CXC chemokine family , which is the most powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils . At the same level of strain , macrophages produce metalloproteins , which remodel the extracellular matrix . Interestingly , no alveolar cells tested at this level of strain produced any other cytokine , including tumour necrosis factor - a .

Thus the strain is equally distributed within the lines and the springs . c ) If one element is consolidated ( inclusion ) , it carries the force but does not strain . The connected springs experience greater strain . d ) In the case of rupture ( of line B ) , the line does not carry any stress / strain ; however , the lines in parallel undergo greater stress and strain . In mathematical terms , each spring has stiffness K , except spring B2 , whose stiffness is MK and which determines the different behaviours of the model . When F is applied , the model behaves according to the following equations : D L = F ( 6 M z 3 ) / ( K ( 7 M z 2 ) ) ; D L A1 = D L A2 = D L A3 = D L C1 = D L C2 = D L C3 = D L / 3 ; D LB 1 = D LB3 = M D L / ( 2 M z 1 ) ; D LB2 = D L / ( 2 M z 1 ) ; F A = F C = F ( 6 M z 3 ) / ( 21 M z 6 ) ; and F B = 3 MF / ( 7 M z 2 ) . If M = 1 the system is homogeneous ; if M = 0 , line B is broken ; and , ﬁnally , if M R ‘ , B2 behaves as an inclusion .

At 30 and 40 % strain , A549 epithelial cells produce IL - 8 [ 36 , 37 ] , whereas , at 50 % surface strain , which should correspond , in that experimental set - up with rat epithelial cells , to a volume change greater than total lung capacity in vivo , 70 % cell death has been reported [ 38 ] . These data refer to the magnitude of strain ( a rough equivalent of end - inspiratory lung volume ) . However , it has been shown , both in vitro and in vivo , that the duration of strain , as well as its amplitude and frequency , may increase the injury [ 39 – 42 ] . Interestingly , for the same magnitude of strain , reducing its (cid:29) (cid:30) (cid:6)(cid:29) (cid:6)(cid:30) (cid:7)(cid:29) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:31) (cid:25) (cid:26) (cid:15) (cid:18)(cid:18) (cid:1) !

GATTINONI ET AL . amplitude ( by increasing baseline strain ) reduces epithelial cell injury [ 40 ] . Indeed , from the bulk of data , it appears that cyclic nonphysiological strain on alveolar cells induces release of IL - 8 and metalloproteins , whereas cell death occurs when the strain exceeds the total volume capacity . It is tempting to speculate that the possible ﬁrst trigger of the biological reaction is IL - 8 , the most powerful chemokine for neutrophil activation . The role of IL - 8 as a ﬁrst cytokine responsible for the further sequence of events that leads to inﬂammation , through neutrophil recruitment , has been recently underlined in a mouse model . B ELPERIO et al . [ 43 ] showed , in mice ventilated at a V T of 6 ( low - strain group ) and 12 ( high - strain group ) mL ? kg body weight - 1 , that neutrophil activation was increased compared to the spontaneously breathing control group and that neutrophil activation was proportional to the strain . The strain / injury was associated with an increase in levels of CXC2 chemokine ( a murine equivalent of IL - 8 ) and its receptors . Blocking CXC2 or its receptors with speciﬁc antibodies , or using knockout mice for CXC2 receptors , did not induce neutrophil activation and attenuated VILI . The bulk of data strongly support a cause / effect relationship bet - ween strain , IL - 8 production , neutrophil activation and VILI . Lung capillaries The ﬁbre system provides mechanical support for the pulmonary blood vessels . In the alveolar septum , where the axial and peripheral ﬁbre systems are interconnected , the alveolar capillary network is interwoven with the meshwork of septal ﬁbres . It has been known for a long time that excessive strain of the lung structures , for minutes or days , depending on animal species , causes pulmonary oedema of varying degree ( the closed chest approach results in less oedema than the open chest approach when applying the same P aw ) , associated with gas exchange impairment , hyaline membrane formation and neutrophil inﬁltration [ 44 – 49 ] . The key issue is understanding how the excessive mechanical strain causes oedema . When the alveolar ﬁbre network expe - riences a nonphysiological excessive strain , the capillary mesh - work of the alveolar septum ﬂattens , whereas the corner vessels maintain or increase their patency . The ﬁnal result is increased resistance to blood ﬂow , which leads to increased pulmonary artery pressure . This , in turn , causes an increased ﬁltration rate in excess of the increased lymph ﬂow , with ﬂuid accumulation in the interstitial spaces . Indeed , part of the oedema due to high pressure / volume ventilation is " hydro - static " in nature [ 50 ] . However , the excessive strain also causes increased per - meability of the capillary network [ 45 , 46 ] . This was initially attributed to a " stretched pore phenomenon " , a passive pro - cess due to the increased hydrostatic pressure forcing the loose connections between the endothelial cells . However , it has also been shown that intercellular gaps may occur at high transmural capillary pressure despite the intact extracellular matrix [ 51 – 53 ] . This active process , probably involving cell contraction [ 54 ] , is possibly due to Ca 2 z inﬂux through (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:5) * (cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:18) (cid:22)(cid:16) (cid:13)(cid:15)(cid:13)(cid:27)(cid:26)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:15) (cid:24)(cid:15)(cid:26)(cid:13)(cid:15)(cid:2)(cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:25) + (cid:5)(cid:2) (cid:7)(cid:11) (cid:22)(cid:16) , (cid:21)(cid:17) - .

The increase in intra - cellular Ca 2 z level has multiple effects that may inﬂuence permeability , including increased actin / myosin ﬁlament ten - sion . Blocking the Ca 2 z inﬂux using gadolinium , an inhibitor of stretch - activated cation channels [ 55 ] , or preventing actin / myosin ﬁlament contraction [ 56 ] signiﬁcantly reduces endothelial permeability . Indeed , opening of intracellular / intercellular gaps , remodelling of the cytoskeleton and active cell contraction may all contribute to increased permeability . Moreover , full - blown inﬂammation , in which neutrophils are recruited , may very well induce , through a variety of media - tors , increased endothelial permeability [ 54 ] . At intermediate degrees of strain , such mechanosignalling may be the trigger of VILI . When the applied mechanical stress is very high , however , the extracellular matrix may break , the inﬂamma - tory process being a consequence rather than the initiator / associated trigger of the observed damage . Indeed , it is quite clear that , depending on the applied stress / strain , pulmonary oedema may occur with or without inﬂammation . It is worth underlining , however , the harmful interaction between excessive alveolar strain , pulmonary artery pressure and lung capillary blood volume . First , high capillary pres - sure may induce stress failure with increased permeability [ 53 ] and any increase in pressure increases oedema formation [ 57 ] . Moreover , it has been shown that cyclic changes in peri - vascular pressure surrounding extra - alveolar vessels due to mechanical ventilation cause greater oedema than isolated phasicelevationofpulmonaryarterypressurewithoutmechani - cal ventilation [ 41 ] . Finally , not only elevated but also low capillary pressure may damage the lung . Indeed , low capillary pressure may facilitate collapse and decollapse of the alveolar capillaries , with possible stress failure , whereas , in the mean - time , it may increase transmural pressure in extra - alveolar capillaries , with increased oedema formation [ 58 ] . Ventilator - induced lung injury and species As most of the studies on VILI have been performed in animals , it is worth discussing some of the important dif - ferences between the various animal species . In some experi - ments , VILI was induced by using different V T normalised to body weight ( in kilograms ) ( table 2 ) [ 43 , 48 , 49 , 59 , 60 ] . Unfortunately , lung volume , alveolar size and body weight are not linearly related across the various species . In ﬁgure 4 , based on anatomical data reported by M ERCER et al . [ 64 ] , alveolar diameter changes , which reﬂect the tension to which the ﬁbres of the lung 9 s ﬁbrous skeleton are subjected , are shown relative to V T per kilogram of body weight . As shown , a V T of 10 mL ? kg body weight - 1 in normal humans induces an increase in alveolar diameter of y 10 % . In mice , the same normalised V T induces an alveolar diameter increase of y 40 % , which , in humans , would correspond to a V T of y 45 mL ? kg body weight - 1 . In other experimental studies on VILI , the injurious strategy was applied using high P aw rather than high V T . However , the relationship between P aw and P L , the real trigger of VILI , depends on the ratio between E L and E rs ( Equation 3 ) . This ratio ( E L / E rs ) varies widely across species , from near 1 in mice to y 0 . 5 in normal humans ( table 2 ) . If P L is taken into account , the distinction between volu - trauma and barotrauma vanishes . In the experiments of D REYFUSS et al . [ 65 ] , which led to the volutrauma concept , the high P aw / low V T was obtained by increasing the E w by strapping the rat thorax with rubber bands . In this case , the P L , despite the high P aw , was greatly decreased , and , obviously , the lung damage was lesser than in rats ventilated at the same P aw with normal E w . Indeed , from the bulk of the data , it appears that , to produce VILI in normal lung , high P L need to be used , irres - pective of whether volume control or pressure control ven - tilation are used . However , in clinical practice , the great concern is VILI in an already diseased lung . Interestingly , the few experimental data available suggest that VILI may be induced in diseased lung at lower V T / P aw than in normal lung [ 66 , 67 ] . This is quite understandable if the relationship between E rs and EELV is taken into account . In ARDS , the lung is " small " rather than " stiff " [ 2 ] , and E rs is a function of ventilatable EELV [ 68 ] , speciﬁc E rs ( E rs / EELV ) being near normal [ 69 ] . Indeed , the tension throughout the lung parenchyma depends on the ratio between the V T and EELV to which the V T is delivered . For example , in a human with severe ARDS with an EELV of 500 mL ( the baby lung [ 2 ] ) , a V T of 500 mL induces approximately the same tension as a V T of 2 , 500 mL in a human with a normal EELV of 2 , 500 mL . Indeed , whereas P L may be considered the rough clinical equivalent of stress , the V T / EELV ratio may be viewed as the rough clinical equivalent of strain . Stress ( P L ) and strain ( V T / EELV ) are linked by speciﬁc E L ( E L , sp ) according to the formula E L , sp ~ ( D P L = D V T ) EELV : ð 4 Þ It , therefore , follows that D P L ~ E L , sp D V T = EELV : ð 5 Þ This indicates that considering the P L or the V T / EELV ratio ( i . e . the ratio between the inﬂation of the whole lung , or any given region , and its resting volume ) are two ways of looking at the same reality , thus reunifying the concepts of barotrauma ( not P aw alone but P L ) and volutrauma ( not V T alone but V T / EELV ) , according to basic physiology . It may also be useful to point out that E L , sp is a kind of " Young module " for the lung ( i . e . stress / strain ) and stress is the independent variable in pressure control ventilation , whereas strain is the independent variable in volume control ventilation .

GATTINONI ET AL . Prevention of ventilator - induced lung injury VILI is the result of a sequence of events , which begins with mechanical alteration of the lung parenchyma , due to excessive global and / or regional stress / strain . If the resulting tension in the structure reaches the limits of stress at rupture , the structures are destroyed ( alveolar wall and capillaries ) . If the tension is lower than these limits , but nonphysiological , a biological reaction occurs , probably involving , ﬁrst , the macro - phages , with IL - 8 production , from which the inﬂammatory cascade , through neutrophil recruitment , fully develops . Patients with VILI present with typical lung inﬂammation , with all its biochemical , histological and pathological charac - teristics . Indeed , VILI may be prevented or attenuated by interfering with the sequence of biological reactions leading to the inﬂammatory response ( chemokine antibodies [ 43 ] , steroids [ 70 ] , etc . ) . However , since nonphysiological stress and strain appear to be the ﬁrst trigger of VILI , the possibilities available for limiting / preventing the excessive regional and global stress and strain of the ARDS lung , i . e . prone position , PEEP and low V T , are discussed . Prone positioning Thus far , P L has been considered as being uniformly distributed ; however , it is well known that , in both humans and experimental animals , there is a gradient of P L along the vertical axis , with the nondependent lung regions experiencing greater P L and greater tension of the ﬁbres of the lung 9 s ﬁbrous skeleton than dependent lung regions . This phenom - enon is enhanced in a nonhomogeneous lung . It was found , for example , that , in an oleic acid model in the supine posi - tion , the difference in P L between nondependent and depen - dent regions was as great as 10 cmH 2 O [ 71 ] . In the prone position , in both humans [ 72 ] and experimental settings [ 73 ] , regional inﬂation is more uniformly distributed along the vertical axis , indicating a signiﬁcant reduction in the P L gradient . This suggests that the stress and strain are more homogeneously distributed within the lung parenchyma , and this is the rational basis for the possible effectiveness of prone positioning in attenuating VILI , as shown experimentally in dogs [ 59 ] and rabbits [ 60 ] . Unfortunately proof is still lacking in patients that prone positioning affects outcome . However , in a subgroup of acute lung injury / ARDS patients treated with high - volume ventilation ( V T of o 12 mL ? kg body weight - 1 ) , the mortality rate of patients ventilated in the supine position was signiﬁcantly greater ( almost double ) than that observed in patients ventilated while prone [ 74 ] .

The dangerous P L was arbitrarily set at 15 cmH 2 O ( . . . . . . . . . . ) , which correspond to y 70 – 75 % of total lung capacity in normal humans ; the area below this represents the " safe zone " . Depending on E rs and E L / E rs , a V T of 6 or 12 mL ? kg body weight - 1 could be either harmful or safe . 21s VENTILATOR - INDUCED LUNG INJURY Positive end - expiratory pressure As PEEP unavoidably results in an increase in mean P L , leading to greater stress of the lung parenchyma , it is quite surprising , at ﬁrst sight , that it is so effective in many ( but not all ) circumstances in attenuating VILI , as reviewed exten - sively by D REYFUSS and S AUMON [ 75 ] . A possible explanation is that , if a lung region is collapsed / consolidated and does not expand during inspiration , the ﬁbres of the neighbouring open regions show increased ten - sion and strain . Indeed , if PEEP is effective in keeping open the collapsed region , the applied force is shared by more ﬁbres with more uniform distribution of stress and strain . Interestingly , the positive effect of PEEP in protecting against VILI have been described in animal models with great potential for lung recruitment , in which PEEP is effective in keeping open most of the lung , thus attenuating the stress / strain maldistribution . It may be wondered , however , whether VILI can be prevented by PEEP when most of the lung is consolidated and the potential for lung recruitment is very low , as in diffuse pneumonia [ 11 ] . Although not proved , it is possible that , in this setting , PEEP simply increases total stress without affecting stress / strain maldistribution . Interestingly , there are no reports showing positive effects of PEEP on outcome in patients , and the PEEP / outcome rela - tionship is still a controversial issue . However , this is not surprising since PEEP was tested in patients with varying probable potentials for lung recruitment . It is possible that the positive effect of PEEP in the patient subgroup with a high potential for lung recruitment was obscured by its negative or zero effects in the subgroup of patients with a low potential for lung recruitment . Low tidal volume Following consensus conference suggestions [ 76 ] , since the late 1990s , several studies [ 77 – 81 ] have been performed in order to investigate the effects on outcome of low versus high V T .

GATTINONI ET AL . two ventilatory strategies , high PEEP / low V T and low PEEP / high V T . This study showed an impressive difference in mortality between the two strategies but was criticised , mainly because of the high ( 70 % ) mortality in the high V T / low PEEP group . The last study of the series was performed by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) network and tested , in an adequately powered trial , the mortality differences between patients treated with V T of 6 and 12 mL ? kg body weight - 1 [ 81 ] . The results showed a signiﬁcantly different outcome , with y 9 % decrease in absolute mortality in the 6 mL ? kg body weight - 1 group . In most of these studies , with the exception of the study of A MATO et al . [ 78 ] , the " safety limit " for P aw was set at 35 cmH 2 O . The contradictory results generated a lot of controversy , to the point that a recent meta - analysis claimed that the NIH network ventilation at a V T of 6 mL ? kg body weight - 1 was unsafe , suggesting that the relationship between V T and outcome is U - shaped , with greater risk of mortality associated with low as well as high V T [ 82 ] . Before discussing the results of the available clinical studies , it is worth recognising that , if two different kinds of ventila - tion produce different outcomes , as in the NIH network ARDS trial , this probably means that the " amount of VILI " associated with the two different kind of ventilation is also different . However , since the real cause of VILI is the P L , it is evident that measuring V T is associated with a great deal of confounding variables . A given V T causes different P aw depending on the E rs ( P aw = E rs V T ) . A given P aw , in turn , produces different P L according to the ratio of E L to E rs ( P L = P aw E L / E rs ) . This indicates that the relationship between V T and the resulting P L may be highly variable . Indeed , it is quite obvious that , in a relatively small population , random - isation may be unable to distribute equally between groups of different E L and E w present in the population under study . This bias should be attenuated in a large population . However , even in this case , the linkage between V T and P L is weak . This is underlined in ﬁgure 5 , where P L is plotted as a function of V T normalised to body weight , for an ideal 70 - kg human at 10 cmH 2 O PEEP , for a range of E rs and E L / E rs . Despite the obvious oversimpliﬁcation of assuming , in this model , a linear volume / pressure curve , and setting the " dangerous P L " arbitrarily at 15 cmH 2 O ( y 70 – 75 % of total lung capacity in normal humans ) , it is quite evident that potentially dangerous P L may be associated with a great variety of V T normalised to body weight as well as with P aw well below the suggested " safety limit of 32 cmH 2 O " [ 83 ] . The V T distributions in the available randomised trials are depicted in ﬁgure 6 . The distributions of P aw , which is related to P L more than to V T ( Equation 3 ) , are also shown in ﬁgure 6 . A huge overlap in the P aw observed in the different studies is evident . However , the discussion between suppor - ters of the importance of V T versus supporters of the importance of P aw as VILI determinant does not seem to have a sound physiological basis as P L is the main determinant of VILI , and it has never been controlled in any randomised trial . Conclusions On the basis of the available experimental and clinical data , the following conclusions may be drawn . Ventilator - induced lung injury is due to excessive global / regional stress / strain and affects the relatively healthier regions of the lung , since consolidated lung regions are not distended . The excessive stress / strain appears to activate ﬁrst macrophages and subsequently neutrophils via interleukin - 8 . The neutrophils amplify the tissue inﬂammation . If stress and strain reach the limit of rupture of the ﬁbre system , mechanical failure may occur with direct rupture of alveolar walls and pulmonary capillaries . The excessive regional stress / strain may be limited by prone positioning and positive end - expiratory pressure ( in a recruitable lung ) which both allow a more uniform distribution of the stress and strain . A low global transpul - monary pressure decreases stress and strain and the available clinical evidence suggests that a low tidal volume is associated with less ventilator - induced lung injury than a high tidal volume . It would have been better , however , to test different plateau pressures , which are linked to the transpulmonary pressure more than to the tidal volume . The best solution , however , would be to directly test different transpulmonary pressures . References 1 . Pontoppidan H , Gefﬁn B , Lowenstein E . Acute respiratory failure in the adult . 3 .
