Here , we established an electron paramagnetic reso - nance ( EPR ) approach to characterize structural features of membrane - bound EHD2 . We show that residues at the tip of the helical domain can insert into the membrane and may create membrane curva - ture by a wedging mechanism . Using EPR and X - ray crystallography , we found that the N terminus is folded into a hydrophobic pocket of the GTPase domain in solution and can be released into the membrane . Cryoelectron microscopy demonstrated that the N terminus is not essential for oligomeri - zation of EHD2 into a membrane - anchored scaffold . Instead , we found a function of the N terminus in regulating targeting and stable association of EHD2 to caveolae . Our data uncover an unexpected , membrane - induced regulatory switch in EHD2 and demonstrate the versatility of EPR to study structure and function of dynamin superfamily proteins . INTRODUCTION Eps15 - homology domain - containing proteins ( EHDs ) comprise a highly conserved dynamin - related adenosine triphosphatase ( ATPase ) family in eukaryotes with four members in mammals ( EHD1 – EHD4 ) and one in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Rme - 1 ) and Drosophila ( Past - 1 ) ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . Studies in C . elegans identiﬁed a function of Rme - 1 in mediating the exit of cargo proteins from the endocytic recycling compartment to the plasma membrane ( Grant et al . , 2001 ) , and a similar function was demonstrated for mammalian EHD1 ( Lin et al . , 2001 ; Caplan et al . , 2002 ) . Subsequently , mammalian EHDs were shown to be involved in a diverse set of membrane trafﬁcking pathways , both emanating from the plasma membrane and internal membrane systems ( Shao et al . , 2002 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2006 ; Lasiecka et al . , 2010 ) . We and others demonstrated that EHD2 speciﬁcally localizes to the neck of caveolae ( Stoeber et al . , 2012 ; More´n et al . , 2012 ; Ludwig et al . , 2013 ) , cup - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane enriched in the protein caveolin ( Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ) . EHD2 is not required for their formation , but it stably associates with surface - connected caveolae and slows down their mobility within the plasma membrane ( Stoeber et al . , 2012 ; More´n et al . , 2012 ) . EHDs are composed of an N - terminal extended GTPase domain ( G domain ) , followed by a helical domain and a C - termi - nal Eps15 - homology ( EH ) domain . The G domains of EHDs bind to adenine rather than to guanine nucleotides ( Lee et al . , 2005a ; Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . X - ray structure analysis showed that the G domains of EHD2 and dynamin are structurally related ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly to other dynamin superfamily members , EHDs can tubulate negatively charged liposomes and oligo - merize in ring - like structures around them ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; Pant et al . , 2009 ) . In the case of EHD2 , this leads to a 10 - fold increase of its intrinsic ATPase activity . However , the rate of stimulated ATPase activity is still two orders of magnitude lower compared with that of dynamin under similar conditions ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ) , pointing to a different function or regulation of nucleotide hydrolysis in these two proteins . G domains of EHD2 stably dimerize via a nucleotide - indepen - dent interface that is not conserved in other dynamin superfamily proteins . A second interface in the G domain promotes nucleo - tide - dependent assembly in dynamin and septin superfamily proteins ( Schwefel et al . , 2010 ) . Dimer assembly via this nucleo - tide - dependent interface may mediate oligomerization of EHD2 into rings ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . Two helical domains protrude in parallel from the G domain dimer . Based on mutagenesis , we suggested that the tips of two adjacent helical domains form a composite membrane - binding surface involving hydro - phobic and positively charged residues . The C - terminal EH domains interact with linear peptide motifs containing an Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) motif ( de Beer et al . , 1998 ) . In the EHD2 dimer , EH domains bind on top of the opposing G domains and may block the nucleotide - dependent assembly interface of the G domain . Upon EHD2 assembly , the EH domains were suggested to switch to a KPFxxxNPF - containing loop in the G domain of the Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 409 adjacent EHD2 dimer . The KPFxxxNPF motif also mediates direct interactions with caveolae and speciﬁc caveolar targeting ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; More´n et al . , 2012 ) . Despite recent progress in structural studies , our previous structural analysis did not reveal the conformational changes associated with membrane binding of EHD2 . These transitions are difﬁcult to address with conventional X - ray crystallography , because liposomes cannot be included in protein crystals . Also , with nuclear magnetic resonance , structures of EHD2 oligomers , due to their large size , cannot easily be resolved . To circumvent these problems , we used a combination of site - directed spin labeling ( SDSL ) , electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) , X - ray crystallography , cryoelectron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) , and cell biology . We found that residues at the tip of the helical domain directly insert into membranes . Furthermore , we identiﬁed a membrane - dependent N - terminal switch that regu - lates cellular targeting of EHD2 . RESULTS The Tip of the Helical Domain Is a Primary Membrane - Binding Site Mammalian EHDs share a sequence identity of 70 % – 85 % and display common domain architecture ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . Based on their location in the crystal structure and on muta - genesis experiments , it has been inferred that residues at the tip of the helical domain ( residues 320 – 340 ; Figure 1C ) mediate membrane interaction ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . Mutations in some of these residues reduce liposome binding and result in a cytoplasmic distribution of the protein when expressed in HeLa cells . To test whether this region recruits EHD2 to mem - branes via a direct membrane interaction , we established an SDSL approach in combination with EPR spectroscopy . The three internal cysteines of EHD2 were mutated to serines . This cysteine - less EHD2 still bound and tubulated liposomes ( data not shown ) . Subsequently , six residues in the helical domains were individually replaced with a single cysteine that was then coupled to the paramagnetic spin label ( 1 - oxyl - 2 , 2 , 5 , 5 - tetrame - thylpyrroline - 3 - methyl ) methanethiosulfonate ( MTSL ) to generate the spin - labeled side chain R1 . EHD2 can remodel liposomes into tubules and small unilamel - lar vesicles ( SUVs ) . For our studies , we used preformed SUVs composed of bovine brain lipids ( Folch ) as a membrane - binding template for EHD2 for two reasons . First , EHD2 binds SUVs with high afﬁnity , even in the absence of nucleotides ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . Second , SUVs were stable over the time course of the experiments ( (cid:1) 30 min ) , resulting in a reproducible membrane - bound conformation . In contrast , EHD2 - decorated tubules generated from Folch - large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) were metastable and led to precipitation of EHD2 , occluding further analysis . First , we investigated the spectral changes of EHD2 spin labeled at position 322 . Phe322 is directly located at the tip of the helical region and was previously proposed to interact with the membrane ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . The continuous wave ( CW ) spectrum of F322R1 showed ordering upon addition of SUVs ( Figure 1D ) . Addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine - 5 0 - O - ( 3 - thio ) triphosphate ( ATP g S ) did not induce further spectral changes ( Figure 1D ) , in agreement with the nucleotide - independent interaction of EHD2 with SUVs . Second , we tested whether additional sites , further away from the tip region , also exhibit mobility changes . EHD2 derivatives contain - ing single spin labels at position 320 , 321 , 323 , 324 , or 328 also revealed ordering upon addition of SUVs ( Figure 1D ) . In contrast , no signiﬁcant mobility changes upon addition of SUVs were observed in the spectra of an EHD2 variant labeled at residue 277 , a site in the G domain not expected to interact with the membrane . To identify residues directly inserting into the membrane , accessibilities of the spin labels to paramagnetic colliders O 2 ( partitions into the membrane ) and nickel ethylene - di - amine - di - acetic acid ( NiEDDA ) ( partitions into the aqueous phase ) were measured . In the absence of membranes , the depth parameter F , deﬁned as the logarithm of the ratio of accessibilities to O 2 and NiEDDA , showed negative values for all EHD2 variants . This result was expected because negative F values ( e . g . , high accessibility to NiEDDA ) are typically observed in solution con - taining 10 mM NiEDDA . In the presence of liposomes , the values of positions 320 , 321 , 322 , 324 , and 328 became positive due to enhanced O 2 and reduced NiEDDA accessibilities ( Figure 1E ) . Although all sites showed ordering with moderate reduction in mobility , none of the sites became severely immobilized by tight packing interaction . Thus , steric exclusion of NiEDDA , as can occur within protein cores ( Isas et al . , 2002 ) , did not contribute to the positive F values . Together , these data indicated direct membrane insertion of the selected sites . Spin labels attached to position 323 and to position 277 in the G domain displayed negative values and thus do not directly insert into the membrane . Calibrating the F values with spin - labeled lipids revealed that the membrane insertion depth of the nitroxide radical was between 3 and 16 A˚ ( Figures 1E and 1F ) , indicating that the entire tip region inserts into the outer leaﬂet of the membrane . These data support the notion that this region represents an important membrane - binding site ; the membrane immersion depth sug - gests that this region may also be able to promote membrane curvature via a wedging mechanism ( Campelo et al . , 2008 ) . Due to the essential nature of this region for membrane inter - action and due to its important role in membrane curvature induction , we consider this region to be a primary membrane - binding site . The N Terminus of EHD2 Folds against the G Domain Our previous EHD2 model starts with residue 19 . Residues 1 – 18 were not included because there was no connecting electron density before residue 19 ( Figure 1B ) . Interestingly , the very N - terminal residues are highly conserved ( Figure 2A ) , indicating a conserved functionality . To study structural and functional properties of these residues , we used our established EPR spectroscopy approach with EHD2 variants singly spin labeled at residues 2 – 9 . CW EPR spectra of these EHD2 variants in the absence of membranes and nucleotides showed predominantly immobile components , indicating an ordered conformation ( Figure 2B , open triangle ) . This was unexpected because the absence of the N terminus in the X - ray - derived model suggested a ﬂexible conformation . Consistent with this notion , each site also revealed the presence of a small fraction of a highly mobile and disordered Structure Membrane Interactions of EHD2 Studied by EPR 410 Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved conformation ( Figure 2B , closed triangle ) . Substitution of the hydrophobic amino acids Phe2 , Trp4 , and Leu5 with R1 resulted in larger percentages of mobile components ( Figure 2B ) and smaller percentages of immobile components ( Figure 2C ) compared with the other N - terminal sites . Thus , the hydrophobic residues might contribute to the stabilization of the ordered conformation of the N terminus , perhaps by interaction with a hydrophobic binding pocket . To locate the position of the N terminus , double electron - elec - tron resonance ( DEER ) distance measurements were performed A B C D E F Figure 1 .

Structure Membrane Interactions of EHD2 Studied by EPR Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 411 using EHD2 variants spin labeled at position 5 in the N terminus and an additional residue in the helical domain ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Figure S1 available online ) . Distances between residues 5 and 28 , 5 and 294 , 5 and 303 , and 5 and 313 ranged from 27 to 48 A˚ ( Figure 3B ) . As a control , the distance between residues 28 and 303 within the helical domain was determined to be 18 A˚ , consistent with the predicted distance derived from the crystal structure . The position of residue 5 was derived by a trilateration method ( Figure 3C ) . This approach indicated that Leu5 is located in proximity to the G domain . To accurately determine this position , Leu5 was mutated to methionine , and a selenomethionine ( SeMet ) - derivatized EHD2 variant was crystallized in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenylyl - imidodiphosphate ( AMPPNP ) . SeMet5 gave rise to an additional signal in an anomalous difference Fourier map ( Figure 3D ; Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the position of this signal was within a previously unexplained electron density patch in a conserved hydrophobic groove at the distal side of the G domain . Previously , the electron density could not be assigned to the EHD2 sequence , due to the limited resolution of the data set , missing connectivity , only partial occupancy ( as suggested by EPR ) , and the presence of two disordered loops in this region .

( C ) Table listing the fraction of immobile spectral components of residues 2 – 9 , based on CW EPR measurements from ( B ) . Using the reﬁned phases , the improved resolution of this data set , and the addi - tional SeMet signal , we assigned the N - terminal seven residues of EHD2 into this electron density ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . As predicted by the DEER data , the N terminus binds back to the G domain . Further in agreement with the EPR spectra , we found that the N terminus packs into a mostly hydrophobic binding pocket ( Figure 3E ) . In addition to the N - terminal residues , seven residues belonging to the spatially adjacent KPFxxxNPF loop were built in the reﬁned electron density . Interestingly , the N terminus is in proximity to the NPF sequence of this loop and makes physical contact with amino acids that are ﬂanking the loop region ( Figure 3F ) . By bridging the KPFxxxNPF loop region to the G domain , the N terminus may regulate the ability of the KPFxxxNPF region to interact with other binding partners ( see below ) . The N Terminus Can Insert into Membranes , but Is Not Essential for Membrane Binding and Oligomerization A recurring theme in membrane curvature - inducing proteins is that N - terminal regions can undergo conformational reorgani - zation and make contact with the membrane , for example , in N - BAR proteins ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ) , epsin ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) , and Arf GTPases ( Lee et al . , 2005b ) . To test whether such a mechanism might also apply to EHD2 , we used EPR spectroscopy of spin - labeled EHD2 variants in the presence of membranes . Similarly to residues in the primary membrane - binding site , N - terminally labeled EHD2 variants underwent spectral changes upon membrane binding . The N - terminal labeling sites ( positions 2 – 9 ) lost their highly mobile and highly immobile spectral components upon SUV binding , and the EPR spectra were instead dominated by spectral components with intermediate mobility ( Figure 4A ) . This suggests an ordered , but not tightly packed conformation of this N - terminal sequence stretch in the presence of membranes . The lack of packing inter - actions also requires a release from the binding pocket in the G Structure Membrane Interactions of EHD2 Studied by EPR 412 Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved domain . Thus , the membrane - bound state of the N terminus represents a third state that is ordered and distinctively different from the two states observed in solution . Spin labels attached at positions 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 showed positive F values upon lipo - some addition , indicating membrane insertion ( Figure 4B ) . How - ever , spin labels attached to positions 3 and 4 in the N - terminal membrane - binding site had negative values , indicating no membrane penetration . Based on our previous calibration ( Fig - ure 1F ) , we conclude that the N terminus undergoes shallow insertion into the outer membrane monolayer . Although the N terminus could bind to membranes , it was not essential for the interaction with liposomes . In liposome Figure 3 .

Structure Membrane Interactions of EHD2 Studied by EPR Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 413 cosedimentation assays , EHD2 bound with similar efﬁciency to LUVs as an EHD2 variant without the N - terminal 18 residues ( EHD2 19 – 543 ) ( Figure 5A ) . We therefore consider the N - terminal region as a secondary membrane - binding site that may modu - late membrane interaction . To probe the tubulation potential of EHD2 , cryo - EM was used . In the absence of ATP , EHD2 efﬁciently bound to Folch - LUVs . However , this resulted only in weak liposome tubulation ( Figure 5B ) . Only in the presence of ATP did EHD2 signiﬁcantly tubulate liposomes and form a highly regular oligomeric EHD2 scaffold ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . Quantiﬁcation of the average tubule diameter indicated a narrow size distribution of EHD2 - coated tubules ( 51 ± 3 . 8 nm ) ( Figure 5E ) . In the presence of ATP , EHD2 19 – 543 also efﬁciently deformed liposomes into tubules of similar diameter that were decorated by an ordered protein coat ( Figure 5D ) . This indicates that the N terminus of EHD2 is not required for membrane tubulation and oligomerization . However , the N - terminally truncated variant showed a broader size distribution of the tubule diameter ( Fig - ure 5E ) . This may point to a role of the N terminus in the formation of deﬁned oligomeric assemblies on membranes . Regardless of these subtle structural differences , a speciﬁc highly oligomeric protein coat could be observed in both cases , supporting the notion that scaffolding is an important aspect of EHD2’s ability to induce membrane curvature . The N - Terminal Residues Control the Localization and Stability of EHD2 Oligomers in Cells Having established that the N terminus of EHD2 undergoes a major conformational change upon membrane interaction that Table 1 .

Structure Membrane Interactions of EHD2 Studied by EPR 414 Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved is not essential for membrane binding and tubulation in vitro , we next asked about the functional signiﬁcance of the N terminus in living cells . We previously showed that EHD2 fused to an N - terminal EGFP - tag extensively colocalized with caveolae when overexpressed in 3T3 - L1 ﬁbroblasts ( More´n et al . , 2012 ) . Due to the spatial proximity and its size , we suspected that an N - terminal tag might mask the functionality of the N - terminal residues . To overcome this problem , we overexpressed a C - terminally Cherry - tagged EHD2 construct ( EHD2 - Cherry ) in 3T3 - L1 cells . In agreement with previous data ( Stoeber et al . , 2012 ) , this construct showed a more diffuse and cytoplasmic distribution than N - terminally tagged EHD2 and only partly associated with GFP - tagged caveolin ( Figure 6A ) . These results indicate that N - or C - terminal tags can inﬂuence membrane recruitment and / or oligomerization of EHD2 . In contrast to EHD2 - Cherry , an N - terminally truncated EHD2 variant ( EHD2 19 – 543 - Cherry ) was found in big clusters and tubes positive for caveolin , with almost no cytoplasmic pool ( Figure 6B ) .

This was sub - sequently conﬁrmed in ﬂuorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( FRAP ) experiments ( Figure 6C ) . In HeLa cells , EGFP - EHD2 has been shown to tubulate membranes , probably due to the low abundance of caveolin in these cells and the tendency of EGFP - EHD2 to oligomerize at membrane surfaces ( More´n et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we used HeLa cells to study the role of the N terminus in membrane recruit - ment . Similarly as in 3T3 - L1 ﬁbroblasts , EHD2 - Cherry localized to the cytoplasm and to discrete punctae representing caveolae ( Figure 6D , left ) . In contrast , EHD2 19 – 543 - Cherry was hardly found in the cytosol , but it formed an interconnected tubular membrane network at the cell surface , indicative of more stable membrane association ( Figure 6D , right ) . These data suggest that the N terminus constitutes a switch region that controls membrane recruitment of EHD2 . DISCUSSION The large size , multidomain nature , and oligomerization of dynamin superfamily proteins make their structural and func - tional characterization challenging . In particular , structures of membrane - bound oligomerized forms of these proteins are difﬁ - cult to characterize . To overcome these hurdles and elucidate structural features of membrane - bound EHD2 , we used a com - bination of methods , including EPR , X - ray crystallography , cryo - EM , and cellular imaging . This study details the application of EPR to a member of the dynamin superfamily , whose proteins are signiﬁcantly larger than most other proteins typically studied by EPR . Our data suggest that analogous approaches can be applied for structural studies of other membrane - bound protein systems of similar complexity . Our structural analysis of soluble EHD2 revealed a previously unknown three - state nature of the N - terminal switch region . When EHD2 is in solution , the predominant conformation of this region is a highly ordered state that is stabilized by speciﬁc interactions with the G domain . In addition , the N terminus can also exist in a highly dynamic , unfolded state in solution . Finally , a third conformational state with intermediate conformational ﬂexibility was observed in the presence of membranes . This conformational ﬂexibility of the N terminus , as identiﬁed by a combination of EPR and X - ray crystallography , is likely a prereq - uisite for its function as a cellular regulatory switch . Intriguingly , point mutations in the N - terminal region of C . elegans Rme - 1 prevent the exit of proteins from the endocytic recycling compartment , showing the functional importance of this region ( Grant et al . , 2001 ) . To characterize the membrane - bound state of EHD2 , we also performed cryo - EM studies of EHD2 - decorated membrane tubules . This approach resolved a highly deﬁned and periodic coat of EHD2 proteins wrapped around the tubular membrane . These data support the previously proposed notion ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) that EHD2 oligomers act as scaffolds that induce A B C D Figure 6 .

Structure Membrane Interactions of EHD2 Studied by EPR 416 Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved membrane curvature , similarly as reported for BAR proteins ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ; Mizuno et al . , 2010 ) . It was previously found that residues at the tip of the helical domain are essential for membrane interaction in vitro and in vivo ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , our EPR data demonstrate that these residues do not simply anchor the protein to the membrane but that several residues directly penetrate into the membrane . Based upon theoretical considerations ( Campelo et al . , 2008 ) , this insertion may help to further promote mem - brane curvature through a wedging mechanism . The concerted use of scaffolding and wedging is not without precedent because amphipathic helices and scaffolding domains are thought to act together in the N - BAR proteins endophilin and amphiphysin ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . Due to this importance of the tip of the helical domain in membrane binding and curvature induction , we consider this region to be a primary membrane - binding site . The shallow insertion of the N terminus seen by EPR depth measurements suggests that this region could also act as a wedge or a membrane curvature sensor . However , in contrast to the membrane insertion of the primary membrane - binding site , the N - terminal region is not essential for tubulation and membrane remodeling of liposomes . This makes it unlikely that the N terminus plays an important wedging function . Instead , our cellular data indicate that the N terminus plays a regulatory role in caveolar targeting . In the absence of the N terminus , EHD2 forms an interconnected membranous network at the cell surface that might result from altered properties of its recruit - ment , oligomerization , or membrane - remodeling activity . The physiological signiﬁcance of this network , if any , is unclear . What could be the mechanism for such functions ? In the absence of membranes , the predominant , ordered form of the N terminus is at a signiﬁcant distance from the membrane - interacting tip of the helical domain . Nonetheless , our data indicate that the N terminus can move away from its binding pocket in the G domain toward the membrane . This movement will disrupt the contact between the N terminus and the KPFxxxNPF loop and its ﬂanking region that is formed in solu - tion . It has previously been suggested that oligomerization is promoted by an interaction of the EH domains from one dimer with the KPFxxxNPF loops of neighboring dimers ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; More´n et al . , 2012 ) . Accordingly , deletions of the EH domain or mutations in the KPFxxxNPF motif reduce oligo - merization of EHD2 . We propose that a membrane - mediated movement of the N terminus induces a conformation of the KPFxxxNPF loop that makes it competent to bind the neigh - boring EH domain . In this case , the N terminus would act as a switch that senses membrane proximity , membrane curvature , or both , and its movement would help to promote oligomeriza - tion . In addition , the N terminus might directly interact with part - ner molecules at caveolae . Further experiments are required to test this hypothesis . The N terminus of EHD2 has similarities but also some differ - ences compared with small G proteins of the Arf family ( Lee et al . , 2005b ; Pucadyil and Schmid , 2009 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Krauss et al . , 2008 ) . It binds into a hydrophobic groove of the G domain in both cases . However , in small G proteins , guanosine triphosphate binding triggers the release of the N - ter - minal amphipathic helix into the membrane . This helix promotes membrane curvature , likely via a wedging mechanism . In contrast to small G proteins , our current analysis of EHD2 did not provide evidence for an interplay between nucleotide binding and release of the N terminus , and it did not indicate a function as membrane wedge . Moreover , unlike in the N - terminal regions of membrane - bound epsin ( Lai et al . , 2012 ) and endophilin ( Jao et al . , 2010 ) , the F values of labeled N - terminal sites of EHD2 did not reveal a clear periodicity that would correspond to a stable a - helical structure . This ﬁnding may not be too surprising because the N terminus of EHD2 contains two glycine residues at positions 8 and 9 that would likely destabilize an a helix . Also PACSINs interact with the membrane via a wedge loop ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) , a region also lacking distinctive secondary structure . Similarly to EHD2 , most members of the dynamin superfamily interact with membranes via a primary membrane - binding motif located at the tip of their helical domains . This was shown , for example , for the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin , and for other membrane - binding motifs in dynamin - like myxovirus resistance ( Mx ) protein A ( von der Malsburg et al . , 2011 ) , bacterial dynamin - like protein ( Low et al . , 2009 ) , and the membrane fusion GTPase atlastin ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) . However , additional N - terminal membrane - binding sites might also be present in other dynamin superfamily members . For example , a long isoform of dynamin - like optic atrophy 1 has a predicted transmembrane helix at the N terminus that might act as a secondary membrane - binding site . Also Mx proteins , guanylate binding proteins , and BDLP , but not dynamin , have long N - terminal extensions of unknown function that may contribute to membrane interaction ( Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ) . Thus , we envisage that the mechanism of N - terminal mem - brane - inserting sequences is a common theme in dynamin superfamily proteins . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation Full - length mouse EHD2 and all mutant constructs , including the SeMet - substituted protein , were expressed as N - terminal His 6 - tag fusions in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) and were puriﬁed as described previously ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . EGFP - and Cherry - tagged variants of EHD2 were cloned into pEGFP - C3 and pmCherry - N1 ( Clontech Laboratories ) , respectively . The monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein - and EGFP - tagged cav - eolin1 plasmids were purchased from Addgene ( 14434 and 27704 ) . Crystallization and Structure Determination Crystallization trials by the sitting - drop vapor - diffusion method were per - formed at 4 (cid:3) C using a Hydra - II pipetting robot ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . We mixed 300 nl of SeMet - substituted mmEHD2 L5M Q410A at a concentration of 20 g / l in the presence of 2 mM AMPPNP ( Jena Bioscience ) and 4 mM MgCl 2 with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 100 mM MES buffer ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 4 % polyethylene glycol 3350 , 5 % 2 - methyl - 2 , 4 - pentanediol ( MPD ) , and 20 mM MgCl 2 . Tetragonal crystals grew within 4 days . Crystals were cryo - protected in two steps by transferring them into buffer containing 50 mM MES buffer ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 75 mM NaCl , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM AMPPNP , and 14 % or 27 % MPD and ﬂash - freezing in liquid nitrogen . Diffraction data from a single crystal were recorded at BL14 . 1 at Berliner Elektronenspeicher - ring - Gesellschaft fu¨r Synchrotronstrahlung ( BESSY ) II and processed using the XDS program suite ( Kabsch , 2010 ) . Crystals were isomorphous to those previously obtained for the mmEHD2 Q410A mutant ( Protein Data Bank [ PDB ] code : 2QPT ) ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . Experimental phases were calcu - lated from single - wavelength anomalous diffraction using Sharp ( Bricogne Structure Membrane Interactions of EHD2 Studied by EPR Structure 22 , 409 – 420 , March 4 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 417 et al . , 2003 ) . Model building was done in COOT ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Transla - tion / libration / screw motion anisotropy and restrained reﬁnement was carried out with Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al . , 2011 ) . All residues were in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot , as assessed by COOT . Figures were pre - pared with PyMol ( Schro¨dinger ) , and sequences were aligned using Clustal W ( Larkin et al . , 2007 ) . Liposome Preparation Folch fraction I bovine brain lipids ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were dissolved in chloroform , dried under gentle argon stream , and desiccated overnight . EPR experiments were performed with SUVs . SUVs at a ﬁnal concentration of 20 g / l were obtained by hydrating 5 mg of Folch lipids in 250 m l of 20 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 300 mM NaCl and tip sonicating until the solution turned clear . For the lipo - some cosedimentation assay , LUVs at a ﬁnal concentration of 4 g / l were obtained by hydrating 1 mg of Folch lipids in 250 m l of 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 . 4 mM KCl , and 1 mM EDTA and ﬁltering 11 times through 800 - nm - pore - size polycarbonate membranes in a mini - extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . For cryo - EM , Folch - LUVs were prepared by hydration to a ﬁnal con - centration of 4 g / l in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 . 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) . The hydrated lipids were vigorously vortexed and then subjected to ﬁve freeze - thaw cycles and ﬁltered 21 times through 800 - nm - pore - size polycarbonate membranes . Spin Labeling DTT was removed from single or double cysteine mutants using PD - 10 columns ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 300 mM NaCl . Five - time molar excess of spin label MTSL ( Toronto Research Chemicals ) wasaddedandreactedwiththecysteinesat4 (cid:3) Covernight , result - ing in residue R1 . Excess spin label was removed using PD - 10 columns , and spin - labeled proteins were ﬂash - frozen and stored at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C . CW EPR Experiments CW EPR spectra of EHD2 in solution at a concentration of (cid:1) 2 g / l were recorded on an X - band CW EPR spectrometer ( Bruker ) ﬁtted with an ER4119HS resonator at 12 . 7 - mW - incident microwave power at room temper - ature ( RT ) . Liposome - bound samples were produced by incubating 50 m g of spin - labeled protein with 1 . 5 mg of Folch - SUVs ( 1 : 30 [ w / w ] protein - to - lipid ratio ) at RT for 20 min . SUV - bound EHD2 was separated from unbound EHD2 by centrifugation ( 152 , 800 3 g , 20 min , 22 (cid:3) C ) . The pellet was resus - pended in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 300 mM NaCl , and spectra were recorded as described above . Accessibilities to O 2 ( from air , P Ox ) and 10 mM NiEDDA ( P NiEDDA ) were obtained from power saturation experiments using an ER4123D dielectric resonator ( Bruker ) . The depth parameter F was calculated from F = ln [ P Ox / P NiEDDA ] ( Altenbach et al . , 1994 ) . The membrane insertion depth was obtained by calibrating F using N - tempoylpalmitamide ( gift from Kyoung Joon Oh ) for position 0 and 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - stearoyl - ( n - doxyl ) - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( Avanti ) with spin labels attached at carbons 5 , 7 , 10 , and 12 ( Altenbach et al . , 1994 ; Oh et al . , 2010 ) . Pulse EPR and Distance Measurements To obtain the distance between spin labels , four pulse DEER ( Pannier et al . , 2000 ) experiments were performed at 78 K on an Elexsys E580 X - band pulse EPR spectrometer ( Bruker ) ﬁtted with a 3 - mm - split ring ( MS - 3 ) resonator , a continuous - ﬂow cryostat ( CF935 , Oxford Instruments ) , and a temperature controller ( ITC503S , Oxford Instruments ) . Samples of EHD2 Leu5R1 Leu28R1 , EHD2 Leu5R1 L294R1 , EHD2 Leu5R1 Leu303R1 , EHD2 Leu5R1 Tyr313R1 , and EHD2 Leu28R1 Leu303R1 were mixed with an equal amount of cysteine - less EHD2 to reduce background from intermolecular distances , cryoprotected in 15 % – 20 % sucrose , ﬂash - frozen , and measured . The data were ﬁtted using Tikhonov regularization ( Chiang et al . , 2005 ) as implemented in DEERAnalysis 2011 ( Jeschke and Polyhach , 2007 ) . Determining the Position of Residue 5 by EPR ResidueR1canadoptseveralconformations . Wepredictedstericallyandster - eochemicallyallowedpositionsofR1usingPRONOX ( Hatmaletal . , 2012 ) . The position of nitroxide radical was calculated by averaging the probability - weighted predicted positions . The unknown position of Leu5R1 was deter - mined as the intersection of four spheres with the predicted spin label position as midpoints and the DEER distances as radii with a Python script ( Script S1 ) . Liposome Cosedimentation Assay We incubated 10 m M EHD2 with 1 g / l Folch - LUVs in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 300 mM NaCl , and 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 for 10 min at RT and centrifuged ( 200 , 000 3 g , 10 min , 25 (cid:3) C , TLA100 ) .

The resulting mixture ( 1 . 125 mM ATP , 80 m M mmEHD2 , and 2 g / l Folch liposomes ) was incubated for 15 min at RT before vitriﬁcationbyﬂashfreezinginliquidethaneoncarbon - coatedgrids ( Quantifoil ) using a Vitrobot device ( FEI ) . Images were automatically collected under mini - mal dose conditions using the Leginon system ( Suloway et al . , 2005 ) on a 120 kV Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) equipped with an Eagle 2k charge - coupled device camera ( FEI ) or on a Tecnai G2 Polara micro - scope ( FEI ) operatingat300kVequippedwithaTemCam - F4164kCMOScam - era ( TVIPS ) . Nominalmagniﬁcations were 42 , 000 3 and 39 , 000 3 , respectively . To determine diameters , individual straight and nonoverlapping tubules were manually selected using e2helixboxer from EMAN2 ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . To account for the low persistence length , each tubule was segmented into over - lappingsquare windows witha lengthof 95 A˚ . Each segment was then individ - uallyalignedparallelto the y axisbased on itslayer linesand centered on the x axis based on its one - dimensional ( 1D ) density proﬁle . Both steps were performediterativelyusingthevectorfromtubuleselectionasthestartingpoint until convergence was reached . Final rotations and shifts were applied and manually veriﬁed before a combined 1D density proﬁle along the x axis was calculated for each selected tubule from its segments . All alignment steps were performed in SPARX using custom scripts ( Hohn et al . , 2007 ) .
