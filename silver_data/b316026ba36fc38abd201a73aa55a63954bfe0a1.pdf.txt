Overall , young individuals present higher proportions of asymptomatic or mild COVID - 19 infection , compared to adults . Data on secondary COVID - 19 transmission in households , according to the cases’ age group , are accumulating . Methods : A follow - up cohort study including all COVID - 19 RT - PCR - confirmed cases ( adolescent students and school staff ) diagnosed in an epidemiological investigation of a large high school outbreak . We compared the adolescent and adult groups regarding clinical symptoms , time to negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests and infection transmission in households . Results : The study population included 817 persons . The confirmed COVID - 19 RT - PCR outbreak cases ( n = 178 ) were followed ( students aged 12 - 19 years , median age 14 years , n = 153 , school staff aged 24 - 67 years , median age 39 years , n = 25 ) and the cases’ household close contacts ( n = 639 ) were tested . The adolescents had lower symptomatic infection rates , shorter time to negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests and lower transmission rates to household members , compared to the adults . The general transmission rate among household contacts was 13 . 5 % , ( 86 / 639 ) ranging from 8 . 6 % in asymptomatic students’ contacts to 27 . 3 % in symptomatic staff contacts . COVID - 19 transmission rates were significantly higher in contacts of symptomatic cases compared to asymptomatic cases ( Odds Ratio : 2 . 06 , 95 % CI 1 . 26 - 3 . 4 ) and higher in adults compared to adolescents ( Odds Ratio : 2 . 69 , 95 % CI 1 . 43 - 4 . 89 ) . Conclusions : Adolescents and adults diagnosed in an outbreak investigation differ as to COVID - 19 clinical presentation and transmission . As adolescents may show mild or no symptoms , COVID - 19 prevention in school settings is challenging . Implementing non - 3 pharmaceutical measures and promoting vaccination programs in eligible staff and students should be considered . Key words : COVID - 19 , epidemiology , transmission , adolescents , school , household . 4 Introduction Worldwide , the number of SARS - CoV - 2 coronavirus disease - 19 ( COVID - 19 ) cases has exceeded 630 million with over 6 million fatalities [ 1 ] . The SARS - CoV - 2 clinical presentation may range from asymptomatic or mild to severe disease , complications and mortality ; severity is associated with increasing patients’ age [ 2 , 3 ] . A systematic review on COVID - 19 clinical presentation among children and adolescents showed that 14 . 6 % - 42 % were asymptomatic . Fever ( 46 % - 64 . 2 % ) and cough ( 32 % - 55 . 9 % ) were the most frequent symptoms ; rhinorrhea , sore throat , headache , fatigue / myalgia , diarrhoea and vomiting , loss of smell , ( anosmia ) and taste ( ageusia ) were less common [ 4 ] . Overall , young children often present with asymptomatic or mild COVID - 19 infection and linked with less transmission [ 5 ] . COVID - 19 clinical presentation and disease course tend to be milder , with a fair prognosis and fewer hospitalizations , complications and mortality , in children and adolescents than in adults [ 3 , 6 - 8 ] . The role of children in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission have been reported as less dominant than adults ; also , seroprevalence rates were lower in children compared to adults , while rates in adolescents were comparable to adults [ 9 ] . Nevertheless , strategies targeted to reduce COVID - 19 transmission – lockdowns , prolonged closure of educational settings and social distancing measures have profoundly affected the well - being of the young population in many countries [ 10 ] . Assessing the COVID - 19 presentation and transmission in schoolchildren is hence necessary . At the end of May 2020 , a COVID - 19 outbreak emerged in a Jerusalem high school , 10 days after schools’ re - opening , affecting some 180 students and staff members [ 11 ] . The outbreak was the largest single COVID - 19 event in a school setting . The epidemiological investigation included testing all the school community by COVID - 19 real - time polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . Subsequent to the outbreak investigation , we aimed to perform a follow - up study of all the school’s COVID - 19 RT - PCR - confirmed cases . The characteristics studied included 5 the clinical symptoms , the time to negative RT - PCR tests and the COVID - 19 infection transmission patterns in households . Methods The COVID - 19 school outbreak necessitated prompt epidemiological investigation and containment [ 11 ] . The school community includes students ( adolescents aged 12 - 19 years ) and staff ( adults aged 24 - 67 years ) . The Jerusalem district health teams performed the investigation in June - September 2020 . The school attendees complied with COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests ( 151 / 152 of staff and 1 , 161 / 1 , 164 of students ) . The Jerusalem health funds laboratories performed the standardized COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests . COVID - 19 was confirmed in 178 persons , 153 students ( attack rate 13 . 2 % ) and 25 staff members ( attack rate 16 . 4 % ) . This follow - up study assembled the epidemiological investigation data . The school community was defined as a cohort group . The study variables included the cases’ demographics , self - reported clinical symptoms , COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests results - until the date of negative RT - PCR tests and the contact tracing among household members . The study population included 817 persons . All the school’s confirmed cases ( n = 178 ) were followed . The household members ( n = 639 ) were defined as close contacts and underwent COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests . The district health teams performed telephone interviews with the school staff , parents and students and offered counselling to the school community , on isolation requirements and various queries . The epidemiological interview included self - reporting on clinical symptoms . Cases were defined as symptomatic when laboratory confirmed and reporting on at least one clinical symptom and as asymptomatic when laboratory confirmed and not reporting clinical symptoms . The follow - up included COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests , consistent with the Ministry of Health ( MoH ) guidelines of a test - based approach ( later switched to a time - based approach ) . The 6 test - based approach defined “recovery” in symptomatic confirmed cases as symptom - free for at least 48 hours and having two consecutive , 72 - hours - apart , negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR results , the first taken at least 7 days after symptoms onset . Asymptomatic confirmed cases required two consecutive negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR results , 72 - hours - apart , the first taken at least 5 days after the first positive test . For the study , we used the MoH definition ( days between the first positive and the second consecutive negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests ) . In May 2020 , in Israel , the virus type was the SARS - CoV - 2 wild type ( Wuhan ) . The data regarding the COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests’ results were retrieved from the national database . The threshold cycle ( Ct ) values for the study participants were unavailable in the database . The MoH guidelines ( May 2020 ) defined a positive test result when viral genome was detected at Ct values ≤35 , indeterminate between > 35 and ≤38 , and negative with Ct > 38 . The study variables included age , gender , reported clinical symptoms , COVID - 19 PCR test results , follow - up to two negative results , COVID - 19 PCR test results in the household members and characteristics of COVID - 19 confirmed household contacts . The distribution of clinical symptoms was assessed in students and school staff . Association between time to second negative result ( in days ) and symptoms was evaluated . The infection transmission rates were assessed according to the tests ' results in the household members . The rates of infection transmission were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases . The data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics ( Version 28 . 0 . Armonk , NY : IBM Corp . USA ) . The comparisons of proportions between the study groups were performed by calculating Odds Ratio ( OR ) and Rate Ratio ( RR ) with the 95 % Confidence Intervals ( 95 % CI ) . Pearson chi square test was used for comparing categorical variables and T test was used for comparing continuous variables . OR and RR were calculated for the comparisons of proportions between the study groups with the 95 % Confidence Intervals . We calculated the 7 p - values using Fisher Exact Test . The medians of the time to second negative COVID - 19 PCR result ( in days ) were compared by the independent sample median test between groups . A logistic regression analysis model was applied to evaluate the possible variables associated with COVID - 19 infection transmission to household members . The variables entered into the logistic regression model were assessed for correlation ( all under 0 . 3 ) . A P - value < 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant for all comparisons . This study was approved by the Ministry of Health , Israel and was performed according to the MoH national guidelines and ethical instructions established for COVID - 19 epidemiological studies ( https : / / data . gov . il / dataset / covid - 19 ) . Results COVID - 19 infection was confirmed by COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests in 178 persons , 153 students and 25 staff members . The COVID - 19 cases’ characteristics are presented in table 1 . Of the 153 students , 97 ( 63 . 4 % ) were aged 12 - 14 years and 56 ( 36 . 6 % ) were aged 15 - 19 years . The rate of reported COVID - 19 clinical symptoms was significantly lower in the adolescent students , 43 . 1 % ( 66 / 153 ) compared to 76 % ( 19 / 25 ) among the adult staff . Notably , all the school staff members who were over 50 years of age ( n = 8 ) reported on clinical symptoms . The clinical symptoms were assembled into three groups , general symptoms ( fever > 38 0 C , headaches , fatigue , dizziness , chills , muscle aches and loss of smell or taste ) , respiratory ( cough , sore throat , rhinorrhea and shortness of breath ) and gastrointestinal ( diarrhea , vomiting and abdominal pain ) . General symptoms were more common in the staff while gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in students ( Figure 1 ) . The most common symptoms reported were cough , headache and fever . The rates of reported symptoms differed significantly between students and staff ( table 1 ) , regarding more than one clinical symptom 8 ( 78 . 9 % in staff , 54 . 5 % in students ) and muscle aches ( 42 . 1 % in staff , 9 . 1 % in students ) . No difference in rates of reported symptoms was observed between males and females . Overall , 852 COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests were performed in the 178 school cases ' follow - up . The mean number of COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests per case was 4 . 8±1 . 5 ( median 5 ) , and 101 of the cases ( 56 . 7 % ) received five consecutive COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests and above . These repeated COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests enabled assessment of the time period ( days ) to reach the definition of “recovery” according to the applicable MoH guidelines test - based approach . Cases were re - tested until having a second consecutive negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR result . The median time to second negative result in all cases was 26 days , 96 . 6 % ( 172 / 178 ) were negative by day 32 . The period was shorter in students ( mean 24 . 4±6 . 7 , median 25 days ) than staff ( mean 27±4 . 4 , median 27 days ) . Figure 2 shows the proportion of cases with a second negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR result , by days , according to reporting on symptoms . Until follow - up day 22 , 44 . 1 % of asymptomatic vs . 25 . 9 % of symptomatic cases were negative ( Odds Ratio : 2 . 26 , 95 % CI 1 . 14 - 4 . 5 , p = 0 . 008 ) ; until day 25 , the proportions were 59 . 1 % vs . 38 . 8 % , respectively ( Odds Ratio : 2 . 28 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 35 , p = 0 . 005 ) . Asymptomatic cases ( mean 23 . 9±6 . 2 , median 24 days ) showed shorter ( p = 0 . 04 ) periods than symptomatic cases ( mean 25 . 8±6 . 6 , median 27 days ) . No difference was observed between males and females . The household members of the school cases were defined close contacts and eligible for COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests regardless of having clinical symptoms . Household members of students and staff ( n = 563 and n = 76 persons , respectively ) were tested . Of the 639 household members tested , 86 persons ( 13 . 5 % ) were confirmed with COVID - 19 infection . Among these 86 persons , in 26 ( 30 . 2 % ) there was one COVID - 19 confirmed household member , in 28 ( 32 . 6 % ) two members and in the remainder - three and above ( n = 32 , 37 . 2 % ) . Of the 639 household members , the transmission rates were higher in adults ( 71 / 279 , 25 . 5 % ) compared to children under 19 years ( 15 / 360 , 4 . 17 % ) , ( Rate Ratio : 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 5 - 3 . 5 , Odds Ratio : 9 7 . 85 , 95 % CI 4 . 3 - 15 . 1 , p = 0 . 001 ) . Figure 3 displays transmission rates according to the cases’ groups . The COVID - 19 infection transmission rates differed with 11 . 7 % ( 66 / 563 ) in the students’ household members and 26 . 3 % ( 20 / 76 ) in the staff household members ( Odds Ratio : 2 . 7 , 95 % CI 1 . 43 - 4 . 9 , p = 0 . 001 ) . Overall , the rates of COVID - 19 infection transmission to household members were higher in symptomatic cases ( 17 . 8 % , 54 / 303 ) compared to asymptomatic cases ( 9 . 5 % , 32 / 336 ) ( Rate Ratio : 1 . 87 , 95 % CI 1 . 24 - 2 . 8 , Odds Ratio : 2 . 06 , 95 % CI 1 . 26 - 3 . 4 , p = 0 . 002 ) . The Crude Odds Ratio comparisons of infection transmission between the groups , regarding age group and having COVID - 19 symptoms are presented in figure 4 . Notably , the highest odds for transmission , related to symptoms , were observed among students aged 15 - 19 years ( Odds Ratio : 6 . 37 , 95 % CI 2 . 39 - 18 . 69 , p = 0 . 001 ) . A multivariate regression analysis model evaluating the dependent variable ‘COVID - 19 infection transmission in the household’ included the variables : age group ( students vs . school staff ) , gender and being a symptomatic COVID - 19 case vs . asymptomatic . In the final model , being symptomatic was significantly associated with transmission . ( Adjusted Odds Ratio : 2 . 04 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 - 4 . 09 , p = 0 . 04 ) . Discussion This study describes a school - based follow - up of COVID - 19 confirmed cases , adolescent students and adult staff . As nearly all school attendees were tested , the group comprised both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases . The adolescents ( median age 14 years ) had lower symptomatic infection rates , shorter time to negative COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests and lower transmission rates in households , compared to the adults . Notably , during 2020 , the first year of the pandemic , the operational classifications ( issued by the ministry of health , MoH ) of case definition ( based on positive PCR laboratory results with or without clinical symptoms ) and the “case recovery” definition evolved considerably . The follow - up in our study included 11 repeated COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests , consistent with the MoH guidelines in 2020 of a test - based approach ( later switched to a time - based approach ) . The study definitions were all according to the MoH clinical guidelines at the time of the outbreak investigation and follow - up . , the cases underwent repeated COVID - 19 RT - PCR tests ( with a median of five PCR tests ) and were followed for 25 days and above . The general transmission rate in households was 13 . 5 % ranging from 8 . 6 % in asymptomatic students’ contacts to 27 . 3 % in symptomatic staff contacts . The odds for transmission were highest among the adolescent students aged 15 - 19 years . In a multivariate analysis , the COVID - 19 transmission rates were higher among the household contacts of symptomatic cases compared to asymptomatic cases . Children younger than 19 years comprise 36 . 1 % of Israel ' s population . [ 12 ] During February 1 , 2020 – August 1 , 2021 , 37 . 8 % of 855 , 000 confirmed COVID - 19 cases nationally were aged 0 - 19 years . Young children ( 0 - 9 years ) and adolescents ( 10 - 19 years ) were 15 . 7 % and 22 . 1 % of COVID - 19 cases and 19 . 7 % and 16 . 4 % , of the national population , respectively [ 12 , 13 ] . In the Jerusalem District ( JD ) 44 . 7 % of the population are under 19 years [ 12 ] . During the above period , 187 , 400 confirmed COVID - 19 cases were notified in the JD . Young children and adolescents were 16 . 3 % and 24 . 7 % of cases and 24 . 3 % and 20 . 4 % of the district ' s population , respectively [ 12 , 13 ] . Related to their population fraction , young children were underrepresented and adolescents were overrepresented among COVID - 19 cases . A systematic review and meta - analysis [ 9 ] assessed susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children , adolescents and adults , concluding that children ( age under 10 - 14 years ) probably have lower susceptibility while rates in adolescents are similar to adults . Another meta - analysis [ 14 ] evaluated susceptibility and SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in children ( age 0 - 19 11 years ) and adults , in community and educational - settings . Compared to adults , adolescents ( 10 - 19 years ) had similar rates and c hildren aged under 10 years had lower rates . Similar to our data , SARS - CoV - 2 manifestations have associated with cases’ age group in reports from many countries including Israel [ 6 - 8 , 15 ] . These age - based differences probably reflect pathophysiological and immune pathways [ 16 ] . E . g . in younger individuals’ airways , lower activity of angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) and transmembrane serine protease 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) . Differences regarding younger individuals’ immune system include CD4 + T cells abundance , reduced neutrophil infiltration , declined proinflammatory cytokines and increased immunomodulatory cytokines [ 16 ] . A study evaluating antibody response in adult and pediatric patients ( New York , March - June , 2020 ) also showed considerable differences [ 17 ] . Adults had anti - spike ( S ) IgG , IgM and IgA and anti - nucleocapsid ( N ) IgG antibodies . Children showed mainly anti - S IgG antibodies ( but not anti - N ) and reduced neutralizing activity , compared to adults [ 17 ] . During the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , households have been repeatedly reported to be a central location for infection transmission . The household transmission in this study was 13 . 5 % , varying between the households of students , staff and symptomatic vs . asymptomatic cases . The SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rates in households vary between settings and populations . A systematic review assessing secondary attack rates of SARS - CoV - 2 in household contacts , found wide variation across countries , with a lowest reported rate of 4 . 6 % and highest reported rate of 49 . 6 % [ 18 ] . A study on household transmission in an ultra - orthodox city in Israel showed that children aged 5 – 17 years and aged 0 – 4 years were less likely ( 61 % and 47 % , respectively ) to have positive PCR results compared to adults in the same household [ 19 ] . Another systematic review and meta - analysis , on the intra - household and close - contact transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 20 ] , showed similar estimates in households of children and adults ( a pooled secondary attack rate for a child index case of 13 . 4 % and 12 . 3 % in adults ) . 12 An updated systematic review and meta - analysis on household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 21 ] showed an estimated secondary attack rate in households of 18 . 9 % . The estimated rate increased from 13 . 4 % ( January - February 2020 ) to 31 . 1 % ( July 2020 - March 2021 ) . The role of schools and educational facilities in COVID - 19 transmission posed a challenge during the pandemic [ 11 ] . A study from England [ 22 ] , during the months of schools re - opening and national lockdowns , showed that SARS - CoV - 2 trends in school - aged children were similar to the trends in adults and reflected the community infection rates . A study in primary schools ( ages 5 - 13 years ) in Norway [ 23 ] reported very low rates of child - to - child ( 0 . 9 % ) and child - to - adult ( 1 . 7 % ) transmission . A study from a large health maintenance organization in Israel [ 24 ] , including 1032 cases under 18 years ( median age 12 years ) indicated that the fraction of primary cases in children did not change after re - opening of educational facilities . A study on COVID - 19 incidence rates before and after school reopening in Israel [ 25 ] , showed that children ( aged 0 to 9 years ) did not show increased rates during school attendance periods , while adolescents ( aged 10 to 19 years ) showed an increase similar to young adults . A study evaluating COVID - 19 transmission in school bubble groups in Catalonia , Spain [ 26 ] , showed that transmission was limited , with higher rates in older ( high school and the last years of middle school ) compared to younger children ( preschool ) . The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control assessed COVID - 19 in children and the role of school settings in transmission [ 27 ] . Emergence of variants of concern triggered transmissibility in all age groups . With the increasing COVID - 19 vaccines coverage in adults , the fraction of children of all cases may surge [ 27 ] . Respectively , in the United States , COVID - 19 cases , emergency department visits , and hospital admissions in children ( age 0 - 17 years ) increased in 2021 . The rise in child emergency department visits and hospitalizations was inversely linked to the states’ population vaccination coverage [ 28 ] . 13 The COVID - 19 pandemic effect of children and adolescents has been extensive , due to changes in daily life routines and frequent alterations in learning activities and school attendance [ 10 ] . A review on the COVID - 19 pandemic social and environmental effects on children reported numerous consequences . These include depressive mood symptoms , anxiety symptoms , suicidal ideation , changes in sleep quality and potential developmental delays [ 29 ] . The overall and long - term effects of the global COVID - 19 pandemic on child and adolescent health requires surveillance and increased awareness of physicians [ 30 ] . The findings of our report are subject to several limitations . It is an observational description , including all the COVID - 19 cases revealed in an outbreak event investigation and follow - up . Hence , it might be challenging to generalize the findings . The educational facilities conditions and the households’ size and crowding may differ considerably between settings and populations . This outbreak occurred prior to the emergence of COVID - 19 variants of concern , some of which may show different presentations or higher transmissibility patterns . The outbreak occurred prior to the availability of commercial vaccines against COVID - 19 . In late December 2020 , vaccination of persons aged 16 years and above against COVID - 19 ( BNT162b2 vaccine ) started in Israel . In June 2021 , subsequent to a rise in COVID - 19 in children and schools’ outbreaks , vaccinations were extended to adolescents aged 12 - 15 years . In November 2021 , the ministry of health endorsed vaccinating children 5 - 11 years ' old [ 15 , 31 ] . In conclusion , we found that adolescents and adults show different COVID - 19 clinical presentation and transmission in households . Transmission rates are significantly higher in household contacts of symptomatic COVID - 19 cases . As many adolescents may show mild or no symptoms , prevention of COVID - 19 spread in schools is challenging . Implementing of 14 various non - pharmaceutical measures [ 32 ] and promoting vaccination programs in eligible staff and students in schools should be considered .
