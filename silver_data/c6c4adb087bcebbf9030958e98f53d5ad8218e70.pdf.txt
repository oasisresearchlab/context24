Jacques , 75014 Paris , France Numerous biologically relevant substrates are selec - tively internalized via clathrin - mediated endocytosis . At the plasma membrane the AP - 2 complex plays a major role in clathrin coat formation , interacting with both cargo and clathrin . Utilizing simultaneous dual - channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy we have analyzed components of the AP - 2 complex ( (cid:1) - and (cid:2) 2 - adaptin ) during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Al - though in static images enhanced green fluorescent pro - tein - tagged AP - 2 markers significantly co - localized with clathrin and other components of clathrin - coated pits , AP - 2 did not seem to be present in clathrin spots that appeared to undergo internalization or motility parallel to the plane of the plasma membrane . Two populations of clathrin at the plasma membrane seem to exist , the dynamic and the static , and AP - 2 appears to be only found within the latter . These results suggest that co - localized clathrin / AP - 2 puncta may represent loci for coated pit production and that previous models that assumed AP - 2 was retained within clathrin coats during endocytosis may need to be re - evaluated . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is involved in internalization of receptors and ligands , cell adhesion molecules , and the syn - aptic vesicle cycle ( 1 – 7 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicle formation re - quires recruitment of adaptor protein complexes ( APs ) 1 and accessory proteins onto the donor membrane , assembly of clathrin coats , induction of membrane curvature , and fission of the mature bud ( 8 – 11 ) . AP - 2 is involved in the formation of clathrin coats at the plasma membrane and links receptor internalization to clathrin assembly . This complex consists of large subunits , (cid:1) - and (cid:2) 2 - adaptins , and two smaller ones , (cid:3) 2 and (cid:4) 2 , and has some structural similarity to AP - 1 and AP - 3 involved in clathrin coat production at the trans - Golgi and endosomes , respectively ( 12 ) . Since the original description of clathrin ( 13 ) , a great deal of information has been gained from co - localization experiments , bulk measurements of endocytosis and in vitro reconstitution ( 14 – 16 ) . These techniques are limited in real - time kinetic in - formation regarding the production of individual clathrin - coated vesicles . Recently , time - lapse epifluorescence micros - copy studies have provided important insights into this process . For example , clathrin - coated vesicles appear to form only in restricted areas of the plasma membrane ( 17 ) and agonist - activated G - protein coupled receptors target to pre - existing clathrin - coated pits for internalization , as opposed to inducing coat formation de novo ( 18 , 19 ) . The technique of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) provides a sensitive approach to examine events near the plasma mem - brane such as exocytosis , cell adhesion , and cytoskeletal orga - nization ( 20 – 22 ) . More recently , work by our laboratory and others has demonstrated that TIR - FM is a suitable system for analysis of molecules involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 23 – 25 ) . The present studies have extended our analysis of endocyto - sis to the AP - 2 complex . Using dual - color TIR - FM to analyze the dynamics of clathrin and AP - 2 in live cells , we have ob - served strong spatial co - localization between dsRed - clathrin and markers for AP - 2 . However , this correlation only holds for the static population of clathrin spots . AP - 2 was not found in dynamic puncta , laterally mobile or internalized . Thus , these two populations of clathrin may be functionally distinct , and although AP - 2 may be involved in the production of clathrin coats , it does not seem to be retained during the process of endocytosis .

Images were acquired with Meta - Morph ( Universal Imaging , Downingtown , PA ) and processed with MetaMorph , NIH image ( rsb . info . nih . gov / nih - image / ) and Photoshop ( Adobe Systems Inc . , San Jose , CA ) . Tf and LDL Uptake— Cells were placed in serum free DMEM for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator to chase out cell surface bound Tf or LDL . Cells were incubated for 30 min in AlexaFluor546 - Tf or DiI - LDL ( Molecular Probes ) diluted 1 : 100 in serum free DMEM , rinsed two times in phos - phate - buffered saline , and placed in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °C . Finally , cells were rinsed two times in phosphate - buffered saline and fixed for 5 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Fort Washington , PA ) . Epifluorescence imaging was performed as described previously ( 21 , 25 , 28 ) . EGFP fluorescence was collected with a 515 / 30 band pass filter ( 500 ms exposure ) and AlexaFluor546 or DiI emission with a 570lp long pass filter ( 100 - ms exposure ) . All filters and dichroic mirrors were obtained from Chroma Technologies Corp . ( Brattleboro , VT ) . Average fluores - cence per pixel for each channel was calculated for each cell using MetaMorph . TIR - FM Image Acquisition— TIR - FM was performed at 37 °C as de - scribed previously ( 21 , 25 , 28 , 29 ) . dsRed and EGFP simultaneous acquisition was performed utilizing an emission splitter ( Dual - View , Optical Insights , LLC , Santa Fe , NM ) equipped with a dichroic mirror to split the emission ( 550DCLP ) . The EGFP emission was then collected through an emission band pass filter ( 515 / 30 ) and the dsRed through an emission long pass filter ( 580lp ) . Dual - color Processing— Dual - color TIR - FM image streams were aligned and correlation coefficients were calculated using MetaMorph , as described previously ( 25 ) . The correlation coefficient is a pixel - by - pixel comparison of the intensity values between the two channels being analyzed and provides a relative numerical representation of co - localization . Correlation coefficients were obtained following pixel shift of the red image planes 1 pixel at a time for 10 pixels in each direction . Each of the four values for each pixel shift was averaged . Alignment was verified by an exponential decrease in correlation coef - ficient following pixel shift . Calculation of Co - localization— 200 dsRed - clathrin puncta were cir - cled and average fluorescence was measured ( 50 per image ) . These regions were then transferred onto the corresponding EGFP - (cid:1) C - adap - tin image , and average fluorescence was measured . The same was done for EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin spots and for the corresponding locations on the dsRed - clathrin images . Additionally , this procedure was performed for regions that did not contain dsRed - clathrin spots and regions without EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin spots . Normalized fluorescence for all dsRed - clathrin regions was calculated by subtracting from the average fluorescence of that region the mean average fluorescence of the 50 regions identified from that image as not containing a dsRed - clathrin spot . The same was done for each EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin data point . Calculation of Fluorescence in Static , Disappearing , and Mobile Spots— 15 spots within each category were identified ( 5 per stream ) . The total fluorescence and area of the region of interest was obtained for each channel , as were the total fluorescence and area of a larger region surrounding the spot . The total fluorescence and area of the spot were then subtracted from the values for the larger region , and then the resultant fluorescence was divided by the area to obtain a value for average background fluorescence within an annulus surrounding each . Finally , each spot was normalized by dividing the average spot fluores - cence per pixel by the average annulus fluorescence per pixel and then subtracting 1 from this number . For EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin and dsRed - clathrin , the average spot area was 28 . 6 (cid:2) 1 . 1 pixels , and the average annulus area was 122 . 9 (cid:2) 14 . 5 pixels . For EGFP - (cid:2) 2 - adaptin and dsRed - clathrin , the average spot area was 23 . 9 (cid:2) 0 . 92 pixels , and the average annulus area was 80 . 1 (cid:2) 6 . 5 pixels . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Previous studies have documented different populations of cell surface clathrin : static spots , mobile spots , and those that appeared to undergo endocytosis ( 17 , 24 , 25 , 28 ) . In our previ - ous studies ( 25 , 28 ) the clathrin puncta at the cell surface that disappeared into the cell ( (cid:3) 15 % per min ) or moved laterally in linear trajectories parallel to the plane of the plasma mem - brane ( (cid:3) 2 % per min ) represented a minority of the total . Thus , two general classes of plasma membrane associated clathrin can be defined , the dynamic and the static .

To examine when and where the AP - 2 complex engages the endocytic machinery , we expressed a sub - unit of the AP - 2 complex , (cid:1) - adaptin , as a fusion protein to EGFP . A similar fusion protein has recently been used as a marker for the AP - 2 complex in FRAP ( fluorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ) studies ( 30 ) and appeared to exhibit wild - type function . Following immunocytochemistry , many EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin puncta co - localized with endogenous clathrin ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) , as well as other markers of clathrin - coated pits ( clathrin , 96 . 7 % co - localization ; (cid:2) - adaptin , 99 . 7 % ; Eps15 , 98 . 9 % ; epsin , 97 . 7 % ; and CALM , 99 . 2 % ; in all cases n (cid:5) 375 spots ) . Additionally , EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin also co - localized with endogenous TfR sug - gesting its presence in active endocytic structures ( Fig . 1 , C and D ; 94 . 1 % co - localization , n (cid:4) 409 spots ) . In contrast , (cid:5) - adaptin ( a component of AP - 1 and not AP - 2 ) did not co - localize with EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin ( data not shown ) . When cells were co - trans - fected with dsRed - clathrin and EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin and imaged simultaneously by TIR - FM , these two proteins appeared to co - localize in a large proportion of plasma membrane associ - ated puncta ( Fig . 2A ) . dsRed - clathrin intensity was signifi - cantly greater in puncta labeled with EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin than in regions without EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin puncta , and EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin fluorescence was higher in regions containing dsRed - clathrin puncta than regions that did not ( Fig . 2 B ) . Addition - ally , quantification of the spatial correlation and the observation that the correlation coefficient decreased exponen - tially with deliberate misalignment of one image relative to the other indicated significant overlap between the (cid:1) - adaptin and clathrin signals ( Fig . 2 C ) . Thus , EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin co - localized in most , but not all , plasma membrane associated clathrin puncta . To verify that EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin does not affect clathrin - mediated endocytosis , we quantified the uptake of Alexa - Fluor546 - Tf and DiI - conjugated low density lipoprotein ( DiI - LDL ) in cells transiently expressing this fusion protein . In these studies endocytosis did not seem to be significantly af - fected by the expression of EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin ( Fig . 2 D and data not shown ) . Since EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin localizes to clathrin - coated pits , and its expression does not adversely affect endo - cytosis , this fusion protein was used to study the spatial - tem - poral regulation of the AP - 2 complex . In contrast to the presence of a dynamic population of clath - rin puncta ( as quantified above ) , when EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin was used to image AP - 2 , all puncta were static . This was observed consistently whether the EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin was observed in single color mode or , when co - expressed with dsRed - clathrin , in simultaneous dual - color TIR - FM video imaging ( Video 1 in the Supplemental Material ) . These results led us to more specifically evaluate the co - localization between dsRed - clathrin and EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin . When a total of 200 spots were analyzed from at least four co - transfected cells ( 50 per field ) , 99 . 5 % of EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin puncta were labeled with dsRed - clathrin . In contrast , only 89 . 5 % of dsRed - clathrin puncta were labeled with EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin ( 179 / 200 : 25 out of 29 in the enlarged field in Fig . 2 A ) . Similarly , in immunocytochemistry studies several puncta of F IG . 3 . dsRed - clathrin and EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin fluorescence in disappearing , mobile , and static spots , n (cid:3) 15 spots per group from at least three cells .

Fluorescence is normalized to the local background fluorescence surrounding each spot at the image plane analyzed . Exclusion of AP - 2 from Dynamic Cell Surface Clathrin 47359 a t R o ck e f e ll e r U n i v e r s i t y , on M a r c h 22 , 2011 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m endogenous clathrin or TfR did not contain EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin ( arrowheads in Fig . 1 ) . Thus , we hypothesized that clathrin devoid of AP - 2 might represent the dynamic clathrin , puncta moving parallel to the coverslip or into the cell . To test this hypothesis we examined whether there were criteria that could distinguish dsRed - clathrin puncta that did or did not label with EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin . To evaluate the dsRed - clathrin that did not co - localize with EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin , clathrin puncta were classified as static , mobile , or disappearing . Fifteen spots were identified from each category , and the dsRed - clathrin fluorescence was ana - lyzed for each . Subsequently , the EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin fluores - cence at the same points in space and time was evaluated . Although , EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin fluorescence was equal to dsRed - clathrin fluorescence in static spots , at the sites of disappearing or mobile spots the EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin fluorescence was indis - tinguishable from the background fluorescence in annuli sur - rounding the puncta ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , this analysis strongly sug - gests that the dsRed - clathrin puncta devoid of EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin are the dynamic population . In many cases moving dsRed - clathrin spots , without AP - 2 , appeared to originate from static puncta of clathrin and AP - 2 ( Fig . 4 ) . A decrease in clathrin intensity was recorded ( Fig . 4 A ) as part of a dsRed - clathrin spot moved away toward the second static spot ( Fig . 4 C ) . In contrast , the fluorescence of EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin at the static spot did not decrease ( Fig . 4 , A and D ) . Additionally , although dsRed - clathrin fluorescence at the sec - ond spot increased as the mobile spot approached ( Fig . 4 B ) , the EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin intensity at this location did not change . The observation of mobile clathrin puncta emerging from static spots does not necessitate that they originated as a single unified structure . However , as the depth of penetration of the evanescent field is roughly equal to the diameter of a clathrin - coated pit ( (cid:3) 100 nm ) , it is unlikely that these occurrences are the results of two distinct clathrin structures co - localizing in X and Y space relative to the plasma membrane but at different depths within the cell . The stepwise increase and decrease in clathrin spot fluorescence at the static points where dsRed - clathrin and EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin co - localize before and after the observed motility ( Fig . 4 ) suggests direct interactions between the static and mobile populations of clathrin . If they did indeed originate from separate puncta , it would still hold that the dynamic moving puncta are devoid of EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin . Our analysis ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) , as well as those of others ( 30 ) , suggest that EGFP - tagged (cid:1) - adaptin is a suitable marker for the AP - 2 complex . However , we sought to test our observations with an alternate marker for AP - 2 ( (cid:2) 2 - adaptin ) , which when linked to green fluorescent protein ( or yellow fluorescent pro - tein ) has also been reported to retain wild type function ( 31 – 33 ) . In preliminary studies EGFP - (cid:2) 2 - adaptin did not seem to significantly decrease uptake of either AlexaFluor546 - Tf or DiI - LDL ( data not shown ) . In the LDL internalization assay some transfected cells did tend to have reduced endocytosis , although this finding was not statistically significant ( R 2 (cid:4) 0 . 0358 ) . TIR - FM performed on cells co - expressing dsRed - clathrin and EGFP - (cid:2) 2 - adaptin demonstrated significant co - localization ( Fig . 5 A ) , and video microscopy confirmed the relative static nature of (cid:2) 2 - adaptin - labeled AP - 2 compared with clathrin . Al - though a few dynamic clathrin spots appeared to contain some EGFP - (cid:2) 2 - adaptin , as with EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin , the vast major - ity of both disappearing and mobile spots were devoid of de - tectable AP - 2 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Quantification demonstrated that the EGFP - (cid:2) 2 - adaptin present at the site of 15 disappearing or mobile clathrin spots was not significantly different from local background . In contrast , static spots contained nearly equiva - lent amounts of clathrin and AP - 2 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Thus , these results verify our previous observations with EGFP - (cid:1) C - adaptin . While co - localization was observed between clathrin and AP - 2 for a majority of spots , a static analysis does not represent the entire story . Our observations show that the minority of clathrin spots devoid of AP - 2 are the clathrin puncta moving either parallel , or perpendicular , to the plasma membrane . This suggests that static co - localized puncta of clathrin and AP - 2 may serve as loci for the formation of clathrin - coated pits . It is possible that the dynamic population of clathrin repre - sents clathrin - coated vesicles that contain AP - 2 , but that the AP - 2 is polarized toward the cytosolic side of the nascent ves - icle , out of the evanescent field . However , as the depth of penetration of the evanescent field employed in these studies approximates the diameter of a clathrin - coated vesicle ( (cid:3) 100 nm ) , this is probably not the case . The observation that AP - 2 does not remain with clathrin puncta that start to move was not predicted in light of current models which suggest that the AP - 2 complex remains within clathrin - coated vesicles subsequent to fission from the plasma membrane ( 10 , 11 , 16 ) . However , as these studies represent the first live cell imaging of the AP - 2 complex during endocytosis , we currently have no information with which to directly com - pare our observations .
