To address this , we assembled branched actin networks in vitro from puriﬁed components and used simultaneous ﬂuo - rescence and atomic force microscopy to quantify their molecular composition and material proper - ties under various forces . Remarkably , mechanical loading of these self - assembling materials increases their density , power , and efﬁciency . Microscopically , increased density reﬂects increased ﬁlament num - ber and altered geometry but no change in average length . Macroscopically , increased density en - hances network stiffness and resistance to mechan - ical failure beyond those of isotropic actin networks . These effects endow branched actin networks with memory of their mechanical history that shapes their material properties and motor activity . This work re - veals intrinsic force feedback mechanisms by which mechanical resistance makes self - assembling actin networks stiffer , stronger , and more powerful . INTRODUCTION Cells are physical objects that interact with the world around them by generating , transmitting , and resisting forces ( Janmey and McCulloch , 2007 ; Kasza et al . , 2007 ) . In eukaryotic cells , many of these forces ﬂow through the collection of cross - linked , branched , and entangled ﬁlament networks that form the actin cytoskeleton ( Fletcher and Mullins , 2010 ; Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . Branched actin networks , for example , generate pushing forces ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) required for many cellular processes , including protrusion of leading edge membranes in migrating cells ( Bisi et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) , motility of intra - cellular pathogens ( Welch and Way , 2013 ) , healing of cell ruptures ( Clark et al . , 2009 ) , endocytosis ( Mooren et al . , 2012 ) , phagocytosis ( Insall and Machesky , 2009 ) , and the formation of tight cell adhesions ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . These dynamic actin networks are created by the branching activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , which creates new ﬁlaments from the sides of preexisting ﬁlaments ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . In addition to the Arp2 / 3 complex , assembly of force - generating networks re - quires two accessory proteins : a WASP - family nucleation pro - moting factor ( NPF ) and a ﬁlament capping protein ( Akin and Mullins , 2008 ) . Despite the mechanical nature of their functions , we know little about how branched actin networks respond to force at the molecular or the material level ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2007 ; Marcy et al . , 2004 ; Parekh et al . , 2005 ; Pujol et al . , 2012 ) . Previous work focused on mechanics of isotropic actin networks held together by entanglement or cross - linking ( Stricker et al . , 2010 ) , which are dominated by ‘‘entropic elastic - ity’’ of individual actin ﬁlaments ( Gardel et al . , 2004a ; MacKintosh et al . , 1995 ; Storm et al . , 2005 ; Wagner et al . , 2006 ) . Theory developed from this work explains effects of ‘‘pre - stress’’ on actin gels ( Gardel et al . , 2006 ) , but its connection to the dynamic and anisotropic cytoskeletal networks created by living cells re - mains unclear . Cells construct actin networks by concentrating assembly fac - tors at speciﬁc sites , establishing physical boundary conditions that dictate dynamics and architecture of the network . Filament nucleation and branching by the Arp2 / 3 complex , for example , creates actin networks that generate force to drive membrane movement ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ; Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Because Arp2 / 3 activity depends on membrane - associated NPFs , new ﬁlaments are created only in a narrow Cell 164 , 115 – 127 , January 14 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 115 zone adjacent to the membrane . Imposing this boundary condi - tion on ﬁlament formation produces anisotropic networks in which most growing ﬁlament ends point toward the membrane ( Maly and Borisy , 2001 ; Weichsel et al . , 2012 ) and has profound mechanical consequences . Isotropic networks assembled in vitro from soluble and randomly distributed Arp2 / 3 complexes are mechanically weak ( Nakamura et al . , 2002 ) , while networks assembled from surface - immobilized NPFs are more coherent and much stiffer ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2007 ; Marcy et al . , 2004 ) . Once polarized , growing actin networks encounter obstacles and experience external forces that may affect their assembly . Here , we ask how mechanical forces affect the biochemical in - teractions that underlie network assembly , and we investigate how the mechanical history of self - assembling networks affects their material properties and motor activity . To measure molec - ular and mechanical responses of branched actin networks to force , we applied simultaneous total internal reﬂection ﬂuo - rescence ( TIRF ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to actin networks assembled from puriﬁed components . To create bio - logically relevant boundary conditions for network growth , we micro - patterned the surface of glass coverslips with a WASP - family NPF . We then quantiﬁed incorporation of proteins into growing networks by TIRF microscopy . At the same time , we used an AFM cantilever to apply force and quantify network growth velocity . To understand the functional consequences of biochemical responses to force , we also used the AFM cantilever to measure material properties of branched actin networks grown under different physical and biochemical conditions . We ﬁnd that force fundamentally alters the assembly , architec - ture , and function of branched actin networks : growth velocity decreases while ﬁlament density increases in response to force . Microscopically , the increase in ﬁlament density reﬂects two changes : ( 1 ) greater number of pushing ﬁlaments , and ( 2 ) tighter ﬁlament packing . Average ﬁlament length , however , does not change with force . Interestingly , the fractional energy of poly - merization converted into mechanical work increases with applied force . Macroscopically , force on growing actin networks enhances their stiffness and mechanical resilience . Networks exhibit their maximum stiffness when loaded with the same forces they experienced during growth . These force - induced changes in material properties , however , do not scale with den - sity or stress according to ‘‘universal’’ laws derived for isotropic actin gels ( Gardel et al . , 2004b , 2006 ) . This argues that the phys - ics of Arp2 / 3 - generated actin networks differs fundamentally from that of random , cross - linked networks . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that assembling branched actin networks under changing load forces produces materials whose stiffness and force - veloc - ity relationships are dominated by their loading history rather than molecular composition . RESULTS Assembly of Branched Actin Networks with Physiologically Relevant Boundary Conditions To mimic enrichment of WASP - family NPFs on cellular mem - branes , we immobilized the Arp2 / 3 - activating region of WAVE1 on functionalized coverslips ( Fourniol et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 1A ) . We then added puriﬁed components—monomeric actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and capping protein ( CP ) —to the WAVE1 D N patterns to create polarized actin networks . To prevent spontaneous nucleation , we also added the actin - binding protein proﬁlin ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ; Tilney et al . , 1983 ) . By confocal ﬂuo - rescence microscopy , networks formed three - dimensional ‘‘pillars’’ growing from WAVE1 D N - coated squares ( Figure 1B ) at 7 . 33 ± 1 . 61 m m / min ( Figure S1A ) , at a rate comparable to actin assembly at the leading edge of migrating cells ( Renkawitz et al . , 2009 ) . Growth velocity did not strongly depend on NPF pattern size , indicating that network assembly is not limited by diffusion ( Figure S1B ) . Because < 0 . 01 % of the coverslip is coated with the NPF , network growth did not signiﬁcantly deplete the pool of soluble protein components , and the ﬁlament networks grew with constant density and velocity for more than an hour ( Figure S1C ) . The distribution of ﬂuorescent Arp2 / 3 ( not shown ) and CP ( Figures 1C and 1D ) were also homogeneous throughout the networks . We used TIRF microscopy to quantify the rate at which individ - ual molecules of actin , CP , and Arp2 / 3 join the growing network at the NPF - coated surface . We reduced the fraction of labeled actin to 1 in 1 . 5 3 10 6 molecules , which enabled us to visualize incorporation of individual actin monomers into the network . Each incorporation event was marked by the sudden appear - ance of a ﬂuorescent spot within an NPF square ( Figure 1E , top panel ) that subsequently decayed exponentially with time as the molecule moved with the growing network out of the evanescent excitation ﬁeld ( Figures 1E and S1D ; Movie S1 ; Sup - plemental Experimental Procedures ) . We counted single - mole - cule binding events and then divided their frequency by the actin labeling ratio to compute a total polymerization rate of 7 , 135 actin monomers - s (cid:1) 1 m m (cid:1) 2 under our experimental conditions . Using this single - molecule approach , we also determined the total rates of nucleation / branching ( 68 Arp2 / 3 - s (cid:1) 1 m m (cid:1) 2 ) and capping ( 57 CP - s (cid:1) 1 m m (cid:1) 2 ; Figure 1E , middle and bottom ) . The similarity of these rates indicates that most growing ﬁlament ends generated by NPF - stimulated Arp2 / 3 activity at the cover - slip surface are also capped near this surface , within the shallow TIRF illumination ﬁeld . We calculated the average ﬁlament length in two ways : by the ratio of polymerization rate to the rate of nucleation or capping ( Figure 1F ) and found that our ﬁlaments grew to a mean length of (cid:3) 300 nm ( or 110 monomers ) , similar to ﬁlament lengths observed in branched networks in vivo ( Vin - zenz et al . , 2012 ) . We conclude that our reconstituted system captures the basic architecture and assembly dynamics of cellular actin networks . Effect of Load on Branched Actin Network Velocity , Density , and Efﬁciency To measure network growth and to apply compressive forces , we positioned an AFM cantilever over an NPF - coated square before initiating network assembly ( Figure 2A ) . To apply constant force to a growing network , we used optical feedback to main - tain constant deﬂection of the AFM cantilever . We divide the cantilever force by the cross - sectional area of the actin network ( 200 m m 2 ) and report our measurements as force per unit area or stress ( pN / m m 2 or equivalently , Pa ) . We ﬁrst applied a step - wise series of increasing load forces to a growing network and measured steady - state growth velocity after the network 116 Cell 164 , 115 – 127 , January 14 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . adapted to the new growth force ( Figure S2 ) . This steady - state growth velocity fell sharply under small loads ( Figure 2B ) but did not stall completely until the load exceeded 1 , 250 pN / m m 2 , a value comparable to pushing and pulling stresses generated by crawling cells ( Gardel et al . , 2008 ; Prass et al . , 2006 ) . The new steady - state growth velocity did not depend on previous forces ( Figure S3 ) , indicating that instantaneous force alone determines network growth at steady state . Finally , the force velocity curve does not follow a simple exponential decay as expected for a ﬁxed number of growing ﬁlaments by Elastic Brownian Ratchet models ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) . Instead , velocity falls sharply at low force but decreases more gradually at higher force ( Figure 2B ) , suggesting a possible load - dependent effect on ﬁlament density . To determine the effect of force on ﬁlament density , we per - formed TIRFM of ﬂuorescent actin incorporating into networks growing under load ( Figure 2C ) . While growth velocity decreases with applied load , the density of actin ﬁlaments in the network increases strongly ( Figures 2D , 2E , and S3 ; Movie S2 ) . This increased ﬁlament density does not reﬂect elastic compression but rather stable , force - induced changes in the material ( see next section ) . The fall in growth velocity and the rise in ﬁla - ment density nearly compensate each other , adding up to a surprisingly weak , load - dependent decrease in the rate of actin A B mCherry - WAVE1 Δ N Alexa488 - actin mCherry Actin WH 2 Profilin - Actin CA PEG - Layer NPF Arp2 / 3 Profilin - Actin PEG Thioether CP Actin filament micropattern Cantilever Ezrin s i de v i e w 15 μ m t = 0min t = 1 : 30min t = 3 : 00min t = 4 : 30min t = 6 : 00min v ≈ 7 μ m / min z - P o s i t i on [ μ m ] 0 - 2 2 4 6 rel . fluorescence [ au ] 0 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 Alexa488 - CP Alexa405 - Actin C D Arp2 / 3 mCherry - WAVE1 Δ N Alexa488 - CP Alexa405 - Actin merge 10 μ m E Average filament length 279 ± 64 [ nm ] [ monomers per Arp2 / 3 ] 105 ± 24 F Alexa647 - actin ( 1 : 15000000 ) Polymerization rate 7135 ± 589 [ s - 1 μ m - 2 ] mCherry - WAVE1 Δ N Alexa647 - Arp2 / 3 ( 1 : 5000 ) Alexa647 - CP ( 1 : 5000 ) Nucleation rate 68 ± 15 [ s - 1 μ m - 2 ] Capping rate 57 ± 12 [ s - 1 μ m - 2 ] Polymerization rate : Nucleation rate 328 ± 75 [ nm ] [ monomers per CP ] 124 ± 28 Polymerization rate : Capping rate 10 μ m 10s Figure 1 .

Using our single - molecule measurement of actin polymerization under low growth force ( Figure 1E ) as calibration , we calculated assembly rates and ﬁlament densities for networks grown under other loading conditions ( right y axes , Figures 2F and 2E ) . Over the functional force range—from zero load to network stall—ﬁlament concen - tration in the network increases from 0 . 125 mM to 1 mM ( ﬁlament volume fractions of 0 . 5 % – 3 . 7 % ) . From basic thermodynamics ( Hill and Kirschner , 1982 ) , we estimated the free energy change of one actin monomer adding to the barbed end of a ﬁlament under our experimental condi - tions ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . Multiplying this value by the actin ﬂux yields the rate of energy consumption by the network as it pushes against various loads ( Figure 2G ) .

The ratio of the power output to the energy consumption rate yields the efﬁ - ciency of the branched actin network as a motor ( Figure 2H ) . This efﬁciency turns out to be highly load - dependent , increasing from (cid:3) 3 % at low force to (cid:3) 14 % at high force . Thus , polymerizing ﬁlaments appear to share their burden more evenly under high load , with fewer futile polymerization events occurring away from the network / load boundary . Architecture and Assembly Kinetics of Branched Networks Adapt to Load We ﬁnd that force increases ﬁlament density in branched actin networks , but does this reﬂect ( 1 ) more polymerizing ﬁla - ments , ( 2 ) a shift in network microstructure to denser packing , or ( 3 ) both ( Figure 3A ) ? To determine whether load increases 118 Cell 164 , 115 – 127 , January 14 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . the number of polymerizing ﬁlaments , we developed an ‘‘arrest - and - label’’ method to visualize free ﬁlament ends in the network ( Figure S4 ) . Brieﬂy , we assembled two dendritic networks side - by - side : one unloaded and one growing against deﬁned load . We then arrested network assembly by adding Phalloidin and Latrunculin B , together with a ﬂuorescent derivative of CP ( Fig - ure 3B ) . The two small - molecules rapidly freeze actin dynamics ( Akin and Mullins , 2008 ) , while the ﬂuorescent CP labels free barbed ends of ﬁlaments in the network ( Figures 3B and S4 ; Movie S3 ) . Accumulation of labeled CP was biphasic ( Figures S4D and S4E ; Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) , with rapid binding to free barbed ends followed by a very slow ex - change of labeled CP with unlabeled CP throughout the network ( Reymann et al . , 2011 ; Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . In addition to TIRFM , we used three - dimensional stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( 3D - STORM ) ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) to count free barbed ends in the network .

Error bars are SD . See also Figures S4 and S5 and Movie S3 . TIRF artifacts , such as compression of free ends into the evanescent ﬁeld ( Figure S5 ) . Both TIRF and 3D - STORM imaging of ﬂuorescent CP after growth arrest showed that the number of free barbed ends in the dendritic network in - creases strongly ( (cid:3) 3 . 3 - fold ) with force ( Figure 3C ) . To estimate the absolute number of free barbed ends , we combined these data with single - molecule measurements of actin incorporation . Based on the growth velocity of our networks under low force ( 7 . 33 m m / min , Figure S1 ) , we estimate one free barbed end grows by (cid:3) 46 monomers per second , which implies the exis - tence of (cid:3) 160 growing ﬁlament ends / m m 2 under low force . This number increases to (cid:3) 550 / m m 2 at high load forces near stall . If growing barbed ends share this load equally , then each polymerizing ﬁlament generates 1 . 9 pN of force under high loads . This greater number of growing ﬁlaments only partly ac - counts for the observed increase in ﬁlament density under load ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that micro - structural changes also occur in the network . Since force causes changes in ﬁlament number and geometry we looked for other force - induced effects on network architec - ture , including changes in ﬁlament length . As above , we calcu - lated average ﬁlament length in two ways , from the ratio of ﬂuorescent Arp2 / 3 complex ( on pointed ends ) and CP ( on barbed ends ) to polymeric actin in the network ( Figure 3F ) , which Cell 164 , 115 – 127 , January 14 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 119 we calibrated with our single - molecule measurements of CP , Arp2 / 3 complex , and actin incorporating into networks under low force ( Figures 1E and 1F ) . Remarkably , these measurements reveal that the mean ﬁlament length in a branched actin network remains constant from low loads that have little effect on network growth up to high loads that almost cause them to stall ( Fig - ure 3F ) . These results suggest that robustness of network stoi - chiometry under load reﬂects a close match between the force responses of ﬁlament elongation and capping . Mechanics of Branched Actin Networks Depends on the Force Experienced during Growth How do load - induced changes in network architecture affect the ability of branched networks to transmit and resist forces ? To address this question , we used AFM - based micro - rheometry to probe the material properties of branched actin networks grown under various loads ( Figure 4A ) . We assembled networks under a constant growth force and arrested their assembly at a height of 10 m m with Latrunculin B . The slow dissociation of CP ( Schafer et al . , 1996 ) and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Beltzner and Pollard , 2008 ) from branched ﬁlaments ensured that networks remain essentially constant during the time required to measure their material properties ( Figure S6A ; Experimental Procedures ) . After assembly under load and kinetic arrest , we performed AFM micro - rheometry on networks at a small , constant force ( 12 . 5 – 25 pN / m m 2 ) . Under these ‘‘relaxed’’ conditions we measured elasticity in the range of 10 3 – 10 4 Pa , consistent with previous measurements on branched networks ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2007 ; Marcy et al . , 2004 ; Pujol et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 4B ) . Both the elastic ( Figure 4B ) and viscous moduli ( Figure S6C ) increased with increasing growth force , a change that corresponded to increased ﬁlament density . Interestingly , when we removed the growth force immediately following arrest , the height of the network increased only slightly ( % 10 % , Figure 4C ) , regardless of the magnitude of the force . This minimal height change shows that force - dependent increases in actin density are stored in the micro - architecture of the network and are not the result of elastic compression . Branched Actin Networks Are Maximally Elastic and Minimally Viscous under Loads that Match Their Original Growth Force Many biological polymer networks assembled in the absence of force exhibit strong stiffening when subjected to subsequent loads or ‘‘pre - stress’’ ( Gardel et al . , 2006 ; Janmey et al . , 1991 ; Storm et al . , 2005 ) . To investigate the mechanical response of branched networks , we performed rheology measurements on growth - arrested actin networks assembled at various growth forces and subsequently pre - stressed with a range of ‘‘test loads’’ ( Figures 4D and S7 ) . We ﬁnd that branched actin net - works are stiffest when the test load matches the original growth force experienced during its assembly . When tested at loads above or below the original growth force , the material either becomes softer or remains the same ( Figure 4E ) . Sparse networks assembled at low growth forces exhibit little softening at lower test loads , while denser networks assembled under high growth forces soften more signiﬁcantly ( 4 - fold ) ( Figure 4E ) . Similarly , when loaded beyond the growth force , the stiffness of sparse networks remained relatively constant , while dense net - works softened . To better compare the behavior of branched networks assembled at different growth forces , we normalized the applied test load by the original growth force . We also normalized the elasticity measured under high test - loads by the initial elasticity of the ‘‘relaxed’’ material . The normalized data illustrate that maximum stiffness occurs when the test load equals the growth force ( Figure 4F ) . Interestingly , the viscous modulus of branched actin networks falls to a minimum when the test load equals the growth force , and increases at lower and higher test loads ( Figures 4G and 4H ) . These data reveal that growing branched actin networks adapt to a speciﬁc growth force to become maximally stiff and minimally viscous at that load . Loading Branched Networks beyond Their Growth Force Results in Mechanical Failure We next measured recovery of the height of self - assembled actin networks following release of a test load ( Figure 5A ) . Purely elastic materials recover 100 % of their original height after force release , but we found that branched actin networks show load - dependent , irreversible height loss following high loads ( Fig - ure 5B ) . Such irreversible plastic deformation is analogous to crushing of a material such as Styrofoam and usually reﬂects permanent micro - structural changes in the material . Networks assembled under high growth forces are stiffer and more resilient to deformation compared to networks grown under low load . Normalizing the test load by the growth force causes all of our deformation data to collapse onto a single curve ( Figure 5C ) and reveals that the growth force also deﬁnes a critical point beyond which the material irreversibly changes . Structural failure was also evident when we measured network elasticity . When subjected to test loads below the growth force , network stiffness recovered to nearly its original value upon test load release . Once loading exceeded the growth force , however , the network failed to recover its original elasticity ( Figures 5D and 5E ) . Such irreversible changes could affect the growth rate and elastic properties of branched actin networks exposed to varying phys - ical boundary conditions . Time - Varying Forces Create Inhomogeneous Actin Networks with Composite Properties In vivo actin networks experience changing forces in a complex and heterogeneous environment . Applying such time - varying forces to growing actin networks yields inhomogeneous mate - rials , with layers of different ﬁlament density . To study such inhomogeneous materials we assembled branched networks under changing growth forces , arrested their assembly , and measured their elasticity under varying test loads . To create two - layered networks , we ﬁrst assembled a dense network un - der 500 pN / m m 2 ( Figure 5F , left ) . At a height of 4 m m , we reduced the load to 25 pN / m m 2 ( Figure 5F , right ) and assembled an addi - tional 6 m m of sparser network . We compared the mechanics of this bi - layered material to homogeneous networks assembled under high or low force alone ( Figure 5G ) . If the bi - layered network was purely elastic its stiffness would be dominated by the weaker material ( Figure 5G , dashed magenta line ; Supple - mental Experimental Procedures ) . Instead , as the test load 120 Cell 164 , 115 – 127 , January 14 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . approached the higher growth force , we observed stiffening in the inhomogeneous material that was intermediate between those of the high - and low - density materials ( Figure 5G , middle green line ) . This result is explained entirely by plastic deformation of the low - density layer when test load exceeds its growth force ( Figure 5G , solid magenta line ; Supplemental Experimental Pro - cedures ) . Once the weaker layer is crushed , the properties of the composite shift toward those of the denser material . In this way , mechanical failure may enable inhomogeneous actin networks to adapt more quickly to high load forces . Anisotropic , Branched Actin Networks Behave Differently Than Isotropic , Crosslinked Networks The stiffness of random , isotropic actin networks ( both cross - linked or entangled ) scales roughly as the square of ﬁlament den - sity ( Figure 6A ) ( Gardel et al . , 2003 ) .

Comparing our results with published data , we ﬁnd that branched networks generated by localized activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex are much denser and stiffer than isotropic actin networks ( Figure 6A ) . Their elastic modulus , however , scales much more weakly with ﬁlament density ( (cid:3) c A 0 . 6 , where c A is the concentration of ﬁlamentous actin ) .

More - over , we observe branched network stiffening at forces more than an order of magnitude beyond the point of isotropic network failure ( Figure 6B ) . The physics of branched actin networks , therefore , appears to be distinct from that of random gels . Filament Crosslinking Proteins Stiffen Branched Actin Networks but Do Not Shift the Critical Force that Deﬁnes Their Material Properties Actin ﬁlament crosslinkers ﬁlamin - A and a - actinin are thought to strengthen some branched actin networks in vivo ( Flanagan et al . , 2001 ; Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . We investigated the effect of these crosslinkers by growing branched actin networks under constant force , terminating their growth with latrunculin B , and then adding either ﬁlamin - A or a - actinin . By visualizing labeled crosslinkers with confocal microscopy , we determined the afﬁn - ities of ﬁlamin - A and a - actinin for branched actin networks to be K D = 0 . 37 m M and 2 . 12 m M , respectively ( Figure 6C ) , in agree - ment with previous studies ( Nakamura et al . , 2007 ; Wachsstock et al . , 1993 ) . Both crosslinkers stiffened branched networks ( Fig - ure 6D ) , but we observed interesting differences between them ( Figure 6D ) . Dense actin networks assembled under high forces stiffened more when crosslinked by a - actinin than by ﬁlamin - A , while sparse networks assembled under low load showed the opposite behavior ( Figure 6D , inset ) . Neither crosslinker qualita - tively changed the shape of the stress - stiffening curve , indi - cating that the mechanical response of branched actin networks is dominated by their load - adaptive architecture rather than by properties of the crosslinker . Interestingly , ﬁlamin - A and a - acti - nin also produced different effects on plastic deformation of branched actin networks loaded above their growth force .

Conversely , both crosslinkers increased plastic deformation of denser networks , probably by ‘‘locking in’’ ﬁla - ment contacts induced by compression . Under these condi - tions , a - actinin enhanced deformation more than ﬁlamin - A ( Figure 6F ) . Motor Activity of Branched Actin Networks Depends on Loading History What happens when a growing actin network pushes against a material with a deﬁned stiffness rather than against a constant force ? The extracellular matrix , for example , can offer deﬁned mechanical resistance to actin - driven pseudopod extension ( Figure 7A ) . A network growing against a barrier of deﬁned stiff - ness does not feel constant force , but a steadily increasing force that depends on how far the barrier is displaced . We , therefore , compared the velocities of branched actin networks grown against AFM cantilevers whose deﬂection was controlled in two different ways . In one experiment , we applied a constant force ( as before ) by moving the cantilever base along with the growing network maintaining constant cantilever deﬂection ( Fig - ure 7B , left ) . Under these conditions , force on the network does not depend on network height . In the second experiment , the cantilever base remains stationary and deﬂection increases as the network grows ( Figure 7B , right ) . In this mode , the cantilever mimics a Hookean spring or an elastic material with a constant stiffness . The more the cantilever is deﬂected , the more force it exerts . To investigate how network growth responds to changing mechanical constraints we performed two - step experiments . First , we assembled two networks under the same constant force . We then switched the two networks to grow against two boundaries of different constant stiffness . Interestingly , velocity of the network pushing against the stiffer barrier fell instantly even though force on the network increased gradually and by a small amount over the short time ( < 15 s ) of this experiment ( Fig - ure 7C ) . Next , we assembled two networks under two different constant forces , one high and one low . We then switched both networks to grow against the same constant stiffness barrier .

This result can be explained by how the free energy of actin ﬁlament assembly partitions between cantilever deﬂection and deformation of the network . In constant stiffness mode , the network and cantilever act as two springs in series . When the cantilever mode switches from constant force to constant stiffness , the force immediately rises above the critical force of the network ( the original growth force ) and , therefore , actin assembly begins to both deﬂect the cantilever and to crush older parts of the network . This partition - ing immediately reduces the growth velocity . To test our understanding of this energy partitioning within the network , we used several known parameters—network elasticity ( Figure 4E ) , growth velocity under constant force ( Figures 7C and 7D ) , and cantilever spring constant , to calculate the growth ve - locity expected at the moment of switching from constant force to constant stiffness ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . These calculated values agree well with measured velocities ( dashed lines in Figures 7C and 7D ) demonstrating how the instantaneous ( but not the steady - state ) growth velocity of branched actin networks depends on loading history . This com - plex dependence manifests in the different height changes of branched networks growing under constant stiffness barriers ( Figure 7E ) and in the force - velocity relationships calculated from them ( Figure 7F ) . The steady - state velocities measured un - der constant force deﬁne the upper bound on growth rates at all forces ( Figure 7F , blue dashed line ) . In contrast , the steadily increasing forces experienced during growth against an elastic barrier create a time - varying loading history and produce not one but a family of force - velocity relationships that deﬁne the ‘‘motor activity’’ of branched actin networks . DISCUSSION The present study demonstrates that force plays a major role in deﬁning the architecture , mechanics , and function of branched actin networks . Speciﬁcally , we identiﬁed an intrinsic force - feed - back mechanism by which load forces experienced during self - assembly increase ﬁlament density and make growing networks stiffer and more resistant to mechanical failure . Importantly , the change in mechanical properties associated with increased ﬁla - ment density does not obey scaling relationships that describe isotropic crosslinked or entangled actin gels . Average Filament Length Is Invariant under Load Elongation of actin ﬁlaments slows dramatically under load , but this slowing has no effect on the average length of ﬁlaments in a self - assembling branched network . The reason is that ﬁlament capping responds to force in the same way as ﬁlament elonga - tion . Individual ﬁlaments grow slower under load , but because capping is also slower , they grow for a proportionally longer time , reaching the same length . The force - invariance of ﬁlament length has important consequences for the material properties of branched actin networks . If , for example , ﬁlament length decreased with applied force , the overall coherence of the network would decrease due to loss of entanglement between branched ﬁlament arbors . Conversely , a force - induced increase in average ﬁlament length would produce ﬁlaments that buckle more easily under lower forces . Either response would nudge the material properties of the network toward a regime that is less capable of resisting the applied load . Force Alters Internal Architecture of Branched Actin Networks Over the range from zero load to forces that stall network growth , the ﬁlament density of a branched actin network increases by about an order of magnitude . A force - dependent increase in the number of free barbed ends ( T . - D . L . , P . B . , D . M . , and D . F . , unpublished data ) accounts for part of this increase in density ( (cid:3) 3 . 5 - fold ) , while the remainder ( (cid:3) 3 - fold ) must reﬂect changes in ﬁlament packing . This is most easily visualized in terms of the angle between the ﬁlaments and the boundary surface they push against . In the absence of strong forces opposing growth , ﬁlaments in branched actin networks in vivo ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ; Weichsel et al . , 2012 ) , in vitro ( Cameron et al . , 2001 ) , and in silico ( Maly and Borisy , 2001 ; Schaus et al . , 2007 ) are distributed symmetrically around an average angle of (cid:3) 54 (cid:4) with respect to the membrane . This angle of attack is determined primarily by the geometry of (cid:3) 72 (cid:4) y - branches made by the Arp2 / 3 complex . A 3 - fold increase in ﬁlament density could be produced by a 3 - fold decrease in the sine of the average angle of attack : from (cid:3) 54 (cid:4) to (cid:3) 16 (cid:4) . This shallower angle of attack could be produced by bending ﬁlaments or branch - points or by increasing the out - of - plane rotation of y - branches with respect to the membrane . Branched Actin Networks Exhibit Unique Material Properties Distinct from Those of Isotropic Actin Gels The elastic modulus of branched actin networks scales more weakly with density ( (cid:3) c A0 . 6 ) compared to isotropic gels ( (cid:3) c A2 ) and their response to test load ( ‘‘pre - stress’’ ) does not follow a ‘‘universal’’ scaling law . The stress - stiffening of isotropic actin networks has shown to be dominated by the entropy of individual ﬁlaments under tension ( MacKintosh et al . , 1995 ) . Our data , how - ever , indicate that the mechanics of anisotropic , branched actin networks assembled under load are determined by different microscopic processes . Instead of the entropic elasticity of long ﬁlaments , the higher stiffness and weaker dependence on density might reﬂect direct bending of short , stiff ﬁlaments con - strained by the branched network architecture . Higher order phenomena , such as the interlocking of meso - scale arbors of branched ﬁlaments , may also contribute under these conditions . New theoretical approaches to actin mechanics will help resolve these questions . Crosslinkers Have Different Effects on Branched Actin Network Material Properties Differences in afﬁnity and in network micro - architecture likely explain the differential effects of a - actinin and ﬁlamin A on sparse and dense branched actin networks . Filamin - A is a v - shape crosslinker that prefers actin ﬁlaments that cross orthogonally . a - Actinin , on the other hand , is a rod - shaped , anti - parallel dimer that can drive formation of gels or bundles . Under low load Cell 164 , 115 – 127 , January 14 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 125 forces , we suggest that the crossing angle between ﬁlaments from adjoining arbors will be (cid:3) 72 (cid:4) , an angle determined by the geometry of Arp2 / 3 - dependent branching and that favors bind - ing of ﬁlamin A . As the geometry of the network changes under load ﬁlaments from adjacent arbors intersect at higher angles , approaching 180 (cid:4) ( anti - parallel ) , a conﬁguration that disfavors ﬁlamin A but not a - actinin . This might explain why , at low growth forces the incorporation of a - actinin has a modest effect compared to ﬁlamin - A , while at high growth forces the effect of a - actinin becomes more signiﬁcant . Motor Activity of Branched Actin Networks Depends on Loading History Mechanical failure of actin networks may be an important element of their adaptation to mechanical loading . When the load on a growing network increases , newly formed material will be denser and stronger than older layers , which are crushed by the higher load forces . Plastic deformation of weaker layers reduces their contribution to the composite stiffness of the ma - terial and transiently reduces network expansion . Understanding the combined effects of force on assembly and mechanical collapse is essential to understanding how branched actin net - works push against their cellular loads . Force - mediated coupling between ﬁlament assembly and material properties represents a key difference between the motor activity of branched networks and motor proteins such as myosin or kinesin . Under a given set of biochemical conditions , the activity of a motor protein is deﬁned by a single force - velocity curve ( Carter and Cross , 2005 ) , whereas the motor activity of branched networks exhibits a spectrum of force - velocity relationships that depend on both the instantaneous internal stiffness of the network and the external stiffness of the material against which it pushes . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Four main techniques are utilized in this paper : ( 1 ) reconstitution of branched networks from puriﬁed proteins ( actin , proﬁlin , Arp2 / 3 , CP , and NPF ) , ( 2 ) biochemical surface micro - patterning of NPFs on coverslips , ( 3 ) atomic force microscopy to control the mechanical loading and to measure the material properties of the network , and ( 4 ) ﬂuorescence microscopy ( confocal , TIRF , and 3D STORM ) of protein assembly in the network at bulk and single - molecule levels . After immersing the NPF patterned surface ( technique 1 ) in assembly mix ( 5 m Mactin , 5 m Mproﬁlin , 100nMArp2 / 3 , 100nMCP ) , branched networks grew ( technique 2 ) under loads imposed by the AFM ( technique 3 ) and molecular assembly was observed by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( tech - nique4 ) . Thisexperimentalapproachallowedustoquantifytheeffectsofforce on branched networkgrowth . We simultaneously measured mechanicalprop - ertiesandﬂuorescenceintensitiesofbranchedactinnetworksthatweregrown under biochemically and mechanically deﬁned conditions . For complete experimental details , see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Surface Micro - patterning We coated the coverslip with a high density of diamino - polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , which was derivatized with maleimide . We then photo - eliminated maleimidegroupsinselectedregionsofthecoverslipbyUVirradiationthrough a photo mask , leaving square regions ( 14 3 14 m m 2 if not indicated otherwise ) of intact maleimide . Unlike previous approaches ( Reymann et al . , 2010 ) , our patterning method does not remove PEG molecules from the coverslip and therefore leaves the surface passivated . We reacted the intact maleimide re - gions with a WAVE1 mutant ( WAVE1 D N ) , which replaced the N - terminal SH1 domain by mCherry and contained a single reactive cysteine residue at its N terminus . This immobilizes the NPF in an oriented and mechanically stable manner . Atomic Force Microscopy To tightly couple the cantilevers to the network , we designed a custom canti - lever holder to reduce the angle of the cantilever on glass substrate surface and coated cantilevers with a peptide from the ﬁlament - binding protein Ezrin . With these modiﬁcations , we never observed slippage between the cantilever and the network and , under loading conditions used in this study , we never observed the entire network macroscopically bend or buckle under the cantilever .
