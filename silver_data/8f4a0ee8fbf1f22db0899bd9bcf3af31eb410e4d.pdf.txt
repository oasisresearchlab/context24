Regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity and internalization in muscle cells by Costin Antonescu A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy Department of Biochemistry University of Toronto © Copyright by Costin Antonescu 2008 ii Regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity and internalization in muscle cells Costin Antonescu Doctor of Philosophy Department of Biochemistry University of Toronto 2008 Abstract GLUT4 is the principal insulin - responsive glucose transporter in skeletal muscle . Insulin stimulation leads to exocytosis of intracellular GLUT4 - containing vesicles to the cell surface , thereby increasing glucose uptake . Muscle contraction also elevates cell surface GLUT4 by a less understood mechanism . Once at the cell surface , GLUT4 may be subject to additional regulation , such as by modulation of its internalization rate or its intrinsic activity . The objective of this thesis was to identify the mechanism of GLUT4 internalization in muscle cells and to determine whether it is regulated by insulin treatment or by the signals elicited by muscle contraction . Skeletal muscle cells in culture stably expressing myc - tagged GLUT4 were used . We found that GLUT4 internalizes simultaneously through a clathrin - dependent and a clathrin - and caveolae - independent and cholesterol - and dynamin - dependent pathway . Insulin did not regulate GLUT4 internalization . In contrast , mitochondrial uncoupling , which may mimic the heightened energy demand that occurs during muscle contraction , retarded GLUT4 iii internalization by inhibiting the clathrin - independent route . Activation of both AMP - dependent kinase ( AMPK ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) was necessary and sufficient for this response . We further hypothesized that the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 may be regulated under some conditions , based on a discrepancy between the amount of cell surface transporters and the rate of glucose uptake . In particular , inhibitors of p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( p38MAPK ) lowered insulin - dependent glucose uptake without reducing the number of GLUT4 units at the surface . We found that p38MAPK is activated by insulin through TAB1 - dependent autophosphorylation , yet p38MAPK was dispensable for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake . Mechanisms other than p38MAPK must be involved in the regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity . In conclusion , in addition to its exocytosis , the activity and endocytosis of GLUT4 are regulated by stimuli that increase the rate of glucose uptake into muscle . iv Acknowledgments I would first like to thank my doctoral supervisor , Amira Klip . Being a student under her supervision has been one of the most exciting , stimulating and rewarding experiences I have ever had . It has been without a doubt the steepest learning curve that I have ever experienced and in particular I have learned a tremendous amount from the ‘expansion versus focus’ discussions that we have had on numerous occasions . I am very grateful for the effort and commitment that Amira gives to the development of her trainees , something that I have experienced on numerous occasions first hand . I am particularly thankful for the effort in helping me craft my scientific thinking and writing . I am eternally grateful for the constant support and contributions from my parents , Mariana and Christian Kant . I learned from them my first inkling of scientific curiosity and this gift has provided me with what I am hoping is a lifetime of enjoyment and fulfillment . It is also from them that I first and best learned the importance of hard work , which was essential in completing my graduate education and research leading to this Thesis . I especially want to thank my wife , Allison Guy , for the many years of constant encouragement . It was as a result of her tireless love and support that I able to weather the more difficult moments and to better savour the more enjoyable ones .

Dissociation of stimulation of glucose uptake from that of cell surface GLUT4 content…………………………………………………………………………………………309 1 Chapter 1 1 Introduction The metabolism of energetic molecules to sustain cellular function is one of the fundamental aspects of all living cell - based organisms . A wide variety of energy sources exist from sunlight and inorganic chemical reactions used by autotrophy , to more complex organic molecules that comprise the sole energy source of heterotrophs . The energetics of metabolism is highly regulated at the cellular level , and higher organisms face the added complexity to distribute energetic molecules to all tissues via the circulatory system . In mammals , dietary glucose is a virtually ubiquitous fuel source , either directly or indirectly supplying the energy requirements for most tissues . Importantly , glucose represents an important fuel source for working muscle . 1 . 1 Whole - body glucose metabolism Following a meal , glucose is absorbed through the intestine into the bloodstream , resulting in a large post - prandial increase in blood glucose . Seminal work in the late 19 th century [ 1 ] demonstrating the requirement of the pancreas for the glucose clearance from the blood following a meal were followed by the simultaneous identification of the pancreatic hormone that mediates this effect , termed pancreatine by Paulescu in 1921 [ 2 ] and insulin by Banting & col . in 1922 [ 3 ] , of which only the latter name became commonly used . Since that time , much has been learned about mechanism of insulin action in the disposal of glucose from the blood . Insulin is comprised of a two peptides of 21 and 30 amino acids covalently linked by disulphide bonds , and is secreted from the β - cells within the isle of 2 Langerhans in the pancreas upon sensing a rise in extracellular glucose [ 4 ] . Insulin acutely suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and stimulates disposal of glucose into adipocytes and skeletal muscle [ 5 ] , the latter being responsible for the clearance of 80 % of dietary glucose from the blood [ 6 ] . Antagonizing the actions of insulin is the hormone glucagon , secreted by the α - cells of the pancreas , which stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from non - carbohydrate precursors such as amino acids [ 4 ] . Normal blood glucose homeostasis is achieved by coordinated release of these and other hormones under appropriate conditions . Glucose uptake into cells is mediated by the GLUT family of facilitative glucose transporters ( see Section 1 . 5 ) , of which GLUT1 was the first to be identified [ 7 ] , and is now known to be ubiquitously expressed [ 8 , 9 ] . GLUT4 is the principal insulin - regulated glucose transporter and is primarily expressed in muscle [ 10 ] and fat [ 11 ] . In these cells , pre - formed intracellular membrane vesicles containing GLUT4 relocalize to and fuse with the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation , hence increasing the rate of glucose uptake . This process is termed GLUT4 translocation , and it effectively achieves a reduction in post - prandial blood glucose levels . Insulin is a also potent anabolic hormone that , through multiple actions , leads to uptake of amino acids into tissues , uptake and storage of dietary lipids in adipocytes , increased glycogen deposition and reduced lipolysis [ 4 ] . Of great clinical importance are the lack of insulin due to auto - immune attack and destruction of the β - cells of the pancreas , and the insufficient insulin secretion due to β - cell exhaustion caused by insulin resistance in peripheral tissues . These conditions cause type I or II diabetes mellitus , respectively [ 4 ] , and result in hyperglycemia , which , if not appropriately corrected , leads to severe clinical consequences . Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is manifested primarily as reduced glucose uptake in response to insulin , which , as stated above , leads to type II diabetes . Hence , unraveling the mechanism of glucose transport into this tissue via GLUT4 , should help us deal understand and treat type II diabetes . Current estimates by the World Health Organization suggest that 2 . 8 % of the world population , or 171 million people , suffered from the disease in 2000 , with a rise to 4 . 4 % or 300 million people projected by 2030 [ 12 ] , representing one of the largest human 3 epidemics in recorded history . As such , a great amount of research is being invested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of its pathology and to design strategies to overcome it . This chapter will introduce the basic anatomy and cell organization of skeletal muscle ( Section 1 . 2 ) , and the known signals elicited by insulin in this tissue and in adipocytes ( Section 1 . 3 ) . Furthermore , the activation and roles of an important family of signaling kinases engaged by insulin , the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) are discussed in Section 1 . 4 . The family of facilitative glucose transporters and known aspects of catalysis of glucose transport are described in Section 1 . 5 . The traffic of GLUT4 , and stages regulated by insulin are presented in Section 1 . 6 . In addition to insulin , contraction of skeletal muscle during exercise , which also relies on a rise in cell surface GLUT4 [ 13 ] , elevates the rate of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle . This phenomenon is described in Section 1 . 7 . An important parameter that determines the rate of glucose transport at the cell surface is the internalization of GLUT4 . The known mechanisms of endocytosis are introduced in Section 1 . 8 . The rationale and major hypothesis of this work is that the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle represents an important and selective locus of regulation of GLUT4 by insulin and other stimuli , and this is further introduced in Sections 1 . 9 and 1 . 10 . 1 . 2 Skeletal muscle anatomy Skeletal muscle is composed of many long skeletal muscle cells , termed muscle fibres , which are individual multinucleated cells . The plasma membrane of muscle fibres is termed the sarcolemma . Skeletal muscle fibres are organized into bundles termed fasiculi , ensheathed by a layer of connective tissue termed perimysium , in turn surrounded by a third , heavier connective tissue layer termed the fascia [ 14 ] . Fasiculi contain blood vessels and nerves which synapse onto muscles fibres at neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) . The process of muscle contraction is initiated by stimulation of corresponding nerves , of which the presynaptic termini release acetylcholine into their NMJs , thereby opening of voltage - gated potassium channels in the postsynaptic 4 membrane of the muscle fiber . This in turn results in depolarization of the membrane , which is rapidly propagated along muscle fibres , importantly into tube - like invaginations termed t - tubules . Calcium influx across the sacrolemma triggers release of Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum , a specialized form of the smooth ER , leading to a large rise in intracellular Ca 2 + and binding of Ca 2 + to the protein troponin . This in turn results in dissociation of the troponin - tropomyosin complex , and subsequent sliding of actin - myosin cross - bridges that generates muscle contraction . Of note , contraction consumes large amounts of ATP , causing in a drop in intracellular [ ATP ] [ 15 ] . A cellular mechanism that senses this drop in intracellular ATP and initiates adaptive responses is activation of the AMP - activated protein kinase ( see Section 1 . 7 ) . Muscle fibres are classified as slow - twitch or fast - twitch , based on the speed with which they contract and the predominant myosin heavy chain isoform that they express [ 16 ] . Type I muscle fibres are slow - twitch cells that contain a greater amount of myoglobin ( i . e . , high O 2 capture capacity ) and mitochondria , have higher blood supply and are thus are highly oxidative ( aerobic ) . Type IIx and IIb muscle fibres are large , contain comparatively less myoglobin and mitochondria , have fewer capillaries and thus rely highly on glycolysis for ATP generation ( anaerobic ) . Type IIa muscle fibres have an intermediate amount of mitochondria and myoglobin , and can perform both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism . Type II muscle fibres typically exhibit a greater drop in intracellular [ ATP ] after contraction than Type I [ 15 ] , whereas Type I fibers are more insulin - responsive [ 17 ] . Multinucleated muscle fibres are the result of cell - cell fusion of myoblasts during development . Myoblast fusion also occurs upon muscle injury [ 18 ] in order to develop and maintain muscle architecture . Mature muscle fibres are striated , as a result of repeating patterns of actomyosin contractile apparatus and t - tubule invaginations . The complexity of muscle anatomical architecture , its encasing in connective tissue , described above , and its organized t - tubule system have made it technically difficult to apply current cell biology approaches to this tissue . Instead , several transformed cells in culture derived from skeletal muscles have been widely used as models of this tissue . The best characterized of these , L6 myocytes , first isolated form rat thigh muscle by Yaffe , retain ability to differentiate into myotubes , recapitulating in culture the formation of muscle fibres observed in vivo [ 19 - 21 ] . L8 myocytes [ 20 , 22 ] , also from 5 rat , and C 2 C 12 myocytes , isolated from adult dystrophic mouse muscle [ 23 ] have also been described . L6 myocytes have been more widely used to study insulin action due to their higher magnitude of insulin responsiveness than C 2 C 12 cells [ 24 ] . In the studies presented here , L6 myocytes were employed to study the regulation of GLUT4 . As discussed above , one of the major functions of the hormone insulin is to increase the rate of glucose uptake from the blood into muscle and fat cells . This is accomplished by the movement of intracellular GLUT4 - containing vesicles to the plasma membrane , and subsequent fusion of these vesicles with the plasma membrane . In insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus , the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin in muscle and fat cells is reduced , which in turn causes hyperglycemia . In order to study insulin action on the regulation of cell surface GLUT4 , and thus the regulation of the glucose uptake , several methods to differentiate GLUT4 at the cell surface versus intracellular GLUT4 have been developed ( see Section 7 ) . Of these , detection of cell surface GLUT4 via an exofacial epitope in intact cells represents the best quantitative method , and L6 myocytes stably expressing GLUT4 harbouring a myc epitope in the first exofacial loop ( L6 - GLUT4 myc ) are a well - validated model [ 25 - 27 ] . Upon stimulation with insulin and examination of permeabilized cells , a redistribution of GLUT4 myc from a perinuclear compartment to the cellular periphery can be observed in adhered myoblasts , in rounded up myoblasts and in differentiated myotubes , . However , it is difficult to quantify this change ( Figure 1A - C , respectively ) . Instead , detection of cell surface GLUT4 myc in intact cells can be readily used to show a quantitative ~ 2 - fold increase in cell surface GLUT4 in each case ( Figure 1A - C , ) . Thus , L6 - GLUT4 myc myocytes are an ideal system to study GLUT4 membrane traffic , through the availability of the myc - epitope to the extracellular milieu . A similar movement of endogenous GLUT4 from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery following insulin stimulation can also be observed in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 adipocytes ( Figure 2 ) . 6 7 Figure 1 . GLUT4 resides in perinuclear membrane compartment in unstimulated L6 myocytes and redistributes to the plasma membrane following stimulation with insulin . Adhered L6 myoblasts ( A ) , rounded - up L6 myoblasts ( B ) or L6 myotubes ( C ) stably expressing GLUT4 myc were fixed and permeabilized ( i ) and labeled with anti - myc and anti - GLUT4 antibodies , as indicated , to detect total cellular GLUT4 or left unpermeabilized ( ii ) and labeled with anti - myc antibodies to detect cell surface GLUT4 in intact cells , as described previously [ 25 - 27 ] . Representative images obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope are shown as single z - sections ( A ( i ) , B ( i ) and C ( i ) ) or maximum z - axis projections ( A ( ii ) , B ( ii ) , C ( ii ) ) . Scale 20 μ M ( A , C ) or 5 μ M ( B ) . Figure 2 .

Representative images obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope are shown as maximum z - axis projections . Scale 5 μ M . 1 . 3 Insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and adipocytes The insulin receptor ( IR ) is a member of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase ( TKs ) superfamily , composed of two extracellular α subunits and two membrane - spanning β subunits [ 28 ] . Upon binding to insulin , the α subunit releases allosteric inhibition of the β subunit , which results in transphosphorylation of β subunits on NPxY motifs , and subsequent binding of and / or stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity towards intracellular substrates . This 8 initiates several paralell and integrated signaling pathways leading to glucose uptake , glycogen synthesis , lipid storage , and cell proliferation ( reviewed by [ 29 ] , and Figure 3 ) . Insulin - receptor substrate ( IRS ) binds phosphorylated IR via its PTB domain [ 30 ] . Although several IRS isoforms have been identified ( reviewed by [ 31 ] ) , only IRS - 1 and IRS - 2 co - ordinate the effects of insulin [ 32 ] . Upon binding of IRS to the activated insulin receptor , tyrosine phosphorylation occurs on multiple sites of IRS , and tyrosine phosphorylated YMxM or YxxM motifs on IRS molecules act as docking sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of class I phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) [ 32 ] . This activates the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K to phosphorylate inositol phospholipids on the D3 position ( reviewed by [ 31 ] ) . PI3K is a key player in insulin - stimulated glucose uptake , as evidenced through use of chemical inhibitors [ 33 , 34 ] or dominant negative mutants [ 35 , 36 ] . Phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) produced from phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PI - 4 , 5P 2 ) by PI3K activates PDK1 and also binds to the PH domain of Akt . Akt is subsequently phosphorylated on T308 and S473 by PDK1 [ 37 ] and rictor - mTOR [ 38 , 39 ] , respectively , resulting in its activation . Three isoforms of Akt exist ( Akt1 - 3 ) , of which Akt2 is necessary for insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in muscle [ 36 , 40 , 41 ] and adipocytes [ 42 - 45 ] . Recently , a connection between activated Akt and GLUT4 traffic was been elucidated . Phosphorylation of the Rab - GAP - containing Akt substrate of 160 kDa ( AS160 ) by Akt is required for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes [ 46 - 48 ] and muscle [ 25 ] likely through inactivation of the Rab - GAP activity of AS160 . AS160 has functional Rab - GAP activity towards Rabs 2A , 8A , 10 and 14 in vitro [ 49 ] , and Rabs 10 , 11 and 14 are found on affinity - purified GLUT4 vesicles from adipocytes [ 48 ] . In adipocytes , Rab10 knockdown results in impaired insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 50 ] , whereas in muscle cells this is achieved by Rab 8 and Rab14 knockdown , and not by Rab10 silencing ( S . Ishikura and K . Klip , submitted ) . Moreover , the inhibitory action of dominant - negative AS160 can be overcome by overexpression of Rabs 8A and 14 in L6 myocytes [ 51 ] . This suggests that GTP - loading of selective Rab isoforms bridges insulin signaling and regulation of GLUT4 membrane traffic , in a cell - type specific fashion . A role for 14 - 3 - 3 downstream of AS160 was also proposed based on insulin - stimulated AS160 phosphorylation ( T642 ) - dependent binding of 14 - 3 - 3 to AS160 [ 52 ] . 9 Interestingly , constitutive targeting of 14 - 3 - 3 to AS160 can bypass the requirement for Akt - dependent phosphorylation towards insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 52 ] . The phosphoinositol - 5 - kinase PIK fyve , which can produce PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and PI5P [ 53 ] , may play a role in insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation as insulin recruits PIK fyve to GLUT4 - containing low - density microsome fractions [ 54 ] . Furthermore , insulin leads to phosphorylation of PIK fyve , thereby increasing its activity . Importantly , preventing insulin - stimulated phosphorylation and activation of PIK fyve enhanced insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 55 ] . In contrast , siRNA gene silencing of PIK fyve or of its activator Ar - PIK fyve lowered PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 levels and reduced insulin - stimulated Akt phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation [ 56 ] , as did expression of a dominant - interfering mutant of PIK fyve [ 57 ] . The molecular function of PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and / or PI5P produced by PIK fyve that mediates Akt phosphorylation and / or GLUT4 translocation remains to be resolved . Insulin also leads to dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton , and actin dynamics are required for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 58 ] , isolated rat adipocytes [ 59 ] , L6 myocytes [ 60 ] , and rat skeletal muscle [ 61 ] . Actin rearrangement is not required for the activation of Akt [ 62 ] , nor does impairment of Akt prevent actin rearrangement [ 36 ] . The Rho GTPase Rac is activated by insulin in L6 myocytes and is required for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation [ 62 , 63 ] . Other Rho - family GTPases have been proposed to mediate insulin - stimulated actin rearrangements and glucose uptake in adipocytes : TC10 α [ 64 ] , and the TC10 - associated protein Cdc - 42 - interacting - protein 4 / 2 ( CIP4 / 2 ) [ 65 ] and Cdc42 [ 66 ] . Accordingly , the TC10 - and Cdc42 - interacting GAP TCGAP , when overexpressed , inhibits insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 67 ] , consistent with the involvement of TC10 and / or Cdc42 for insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes . The molecular link between actin rearrangement and insulin action remain to be elucidated , and may differ for adipocytes and muscle cells . TC10 appears to influence GLUT4 traffic through actin rearrangement into what has been defined as cav - actin in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 68 ] . In addition , TC10 is involved in at least two 10 other ways to GLUT4 mobilization . First , through Rab31 , which mediates TGN - to - endosome membrane traffic , as insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis was blocked or enhanced by overexpression or knockdown of Rab31 , respectively [ 69 ] . In turn , the Rab31 - specific GEF Rabex - 5 is recruited to the plasma membrane by insulin via its interaction with the Cdc - 42 and TC10 - interacting protein CIP4 . Second , TC10 is thought to mediate the localization of atypical PKC [ 70 ] , which also influences GLUT4 traffic , primarily in adipocytes ( see below ) . TC10 is activated by insulin independent y of PI3K , instead relying on the axis APS , Cbl and CrkII [ 71 , 72 ] . However , the participation of this axis in GLUT4 traffic has been disputed by several studies [ 63 , 73 ] , and may not operate in skeletal muscle [ 63 , 74 ] . In addition to the IRS - PI3K - Akt - AS160 axis , other signaling proteins have been implicated in insulin - stimulated glucose uptake . Insulin activates atypical PKC ζ / λ ( aPKC ) downstream of PI3K - PDK1 [ 75 , 76 ] , independently of Akt activation [ 77 ] . Moreover , a reduction in insulin - stimulated glucose uptake was observed in L6 myotubes [ 78 ] and 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 77 ] upon expression of a dominant - negative mutant of PKC λ , and by introduction of a PKC - ζ pseudosubstrate in L6 myocytes [ 79 ] . Similar observations were made in skeletal muscle [ 80 ] and adipocytes [ 81 ] of mice lacking PKC λ . Recently , siRNA gene silencing of PKC ζ or PKC λ in L6 myotubes and 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , respectively , reduced insulin - stimulated glucose transport [ 82 ] . The molecular connection between aPKCs and glucose transport remains to be elucidated , although some roles have been proposed . PKC ζ may be required for insulin - stimulated actin remodeling [ 79 ] . Also , PKC - λ forms a complex with Rab4 and KIF3 , and may move GLUT4 vesicles along microtubules [ 83 ] . Finally , aPKCs , along with Akt , may phosphorylate SNAREs required for insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 84 ] . Aside of the IRS - PI3K - initiated pathway , the activated insulin receptor recruits Shc , which , together with IRS1 , recruits the SH2 / SH3 domain containing protein Grb2 to the phosphorylated insulin receptor complex [ 85 ] . Grb2 recruits the Ras nucleotide exchange factor son - of - sevenless ( SOS ) via Grb2 [ 86 ] to ultimately activate Erk [ 87 ] . The activation of Erk and the other mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) p38MAPK and JNK mediates the cell proliferative actions of insulin ( see Section 1 . 4 ) . In addition , insulin - stimulated activation of p38MAPK has been proposed to increase the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 at the plasma 11 membrane , as will be examined in Chapter 2 . Phosphorylated IRS1 also recruits other SH2 - domain containing proteins , including the phosphatase Syp [ 88 ] and adaptor Nck [ 89 ] . The latter has been suggested to impact on the actin cytoskeleton [ 90 ] , and may lie upstream of Rac activation by insulin , but this requires experimental verification . Figure 3 . Schematic representation of insulin signaling in muscle and adipocytes . Following binding insulin , the insulin receptor undergoes autophosphorylation , and recruitment of adaptor molecules , thereby initiating several signaling pathways , as described in Section 1 . 3 . Abbreviations : IR , inslin receptor ; IRS , IR substrate ; p85 and p110 , regulatory and catalytic subunits of phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) ; PDK2 , now known to be Rictor - mTOR ; AS160 , Akt - substrate of 160 kDa , contains a Rab - GAP domain . Activation of MAPK pathways is discussed in Section 1 . 4 and Chapter 2 . 12 1 . 4 Mitogen - activated protein kinases Mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) are a family of well - conserved protein kinases that exhibit dual specificity to phosphorylate threonine and serine residues ( reviewed by [ 91 ] ) . This family includes mitogen - regulated extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( Erk ) , c - Jun NH 2 - terminal kinase ( JNK , also known as stress - activated protein kinase , SAPK ) , p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( p38MAPK ) and big mitogen - activated protein kinase - 1 ( BMK1 , also known as Erk5 ) . Activated MAPKs regulate transcription factors as well as other cytosolic proteins , and have central roles in cell proliferation and development , membrane traffic and stress and inflammatory responses . MAPK signaling pathways are characterized by a three - tier modular activation mechanism ( reviewed by [ 91 ] ) . Phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr within a Thr - X - Tyr motif located in the activation loop of MAPKs by a family of kinases collectively referred to as MAPK / Erk kinases ( MEKs or MKKs ) activates the kinase activity of MAPKs . In the case of p38MAPK , the crystal structure reveals that in the absence of phosphorylation , the activation loop , which consists of 13 residues ( L171 - V183 ) occupies the substrate - binding specificity pocket , preventing interaction with substrates [ 92 ] . Upon phosphorylation , a conformational change takes place in the activation loop , vacating the specificity pocket and allowing substrate binding . This model is also supported by the unstructured activation loop observed in p38MAPK α when bound to a substrate - derived peptide [ 93 ] . MEKs and MKKs are in turn activated by phosphorylation by MAPK - kinase kinases ( MKKKs ) . MKKKs are activated by coordinated membrane recruitment , homo - oligomerization and phosphorylation by an upstream kinase . Specificity of activation of MKKK by stimuli , together with the built - in selectivity of MKKKs and MEK / MKK for particular MAPK pathways confers signaling specificity . Although any given stimulus may engage multiple MAPKs pathways with partially overlapping substrate specificity , Erk , JNK , p38MAPK and BMK - 1 are 13 rarely functionally redundant . MAPK specificity is maintained , at least in part , by scaffolding proteins that both channel MKKK and MEK / MKK to particular MAPKs for activation , and sequester other MAPKs away from upstream kinases to prevent non - specific activation [ 94 ] . Parallel MAPK pathways : Erk , Jnk , p38 , BMK - 1 Erk . Erk1 was the first mammalian MAPK identified as a insulin - stimulated protein with homology to the yeast proteins KSS1 and FUS3 , involved in cell cycle control [ 95 ] . Two additional isoforms activated by growth factors , Erk2 and 3 , were later identified [ 96 ] . Erk is activated by phosphorylation by MEK1 and MEK2 , which are in turn activated by Raf1 , as described earlier . Erk plays a central role in the progression of the cell cycle , through the regulated expression and degradation of cyclin proteins . ( reviewed by [ 97 , 98 ] ) . In keeping with its pro - proliferative role , Erk phosphorylation leads to increased production of cellular material required for growth [ 98 ] . Importantly , Erk upregulates mTOR activity [ 99 ] , a central regulator of cell growth . Activated mTOR leads to increased protein translation and ribosome synthesis , inhibition of autophagy , increased uptake of nutrients such as glucose , amino acids , lipoprotein and iron by regulation of membrane traffic , and transcriptional control of genes involved in metabolic and biosynthetic pathways ( reviewed by [ 100 ] ) . JNK . C - Jun NH 2 - terminal kinase ( JNK ) was identified as a 54 kDa protein phosphorylated in response to cycloheximide [ 101 ] , which in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor c - Jun ( S63 and S73 ) [ 102 , 103 ] . There are three known JNK genes : JNK1 and 2 are ubiquitously expressed , while JNK 3 is expression is limited to brain , heart and testes [ 104 ] . JNK activation , which occurs in response to cellular stress , and to a lesser extent , mitogenic hormones , occurs independently of Erk regulators Ras [ 102 ] and Raf - 1 [ 105 ] , but relies results from direct phosphorylation by MKK4 and MKK7 . These are in turn activated by at least 14 of the 20 known MKKKs , and several JNK scaffolds that simultaneously bind MKKKs , MKK4 / 7 and JNK mediate this process , including JNK interacting proteins ( JIP ) ( reviewed by [ 104 ] ) . 14 Many direct substrates as known for activated JNK , including the transcription factors c - Jun , ATF2 , p53 , Elk1 - 2 , retinoid X receptor ( RXR α ) , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR α ) , NFAT4 ; the nuclear pore complex component Nup214 , microtubule associated proteins Tau , MAP1 and doublecortin ; apoptosis promoting proteins Bcl - 2 , BMF and Smac ; and signaling proteins IRS1 , paxillin and 14 - 3 - 3 ( reviewed by [ 104 ] ) , Importantly , JNK has an important role in the development of insulin resistance . JNK activity becomes elevated during obesity in liver , skeletal muscle and adipocytes , possibly as a consequence of increased circulating levels of the cytokine TNF α [ 106 ] . Studies with JNK knockout mice revealed that , in obese animals , the kinase phosphorylates IRS1 on S307 and that in doing so , JNK attenuates insulin signaling and glucose transport [ 106 ] . Thus , JNK has been proposed to be a functional link between obesity and insulin resistance [ 107 ] , possibly also involving endoplasmic reticulum stress [ 108 ] . BMK - 1 . Big mitogen - activated protein kinase - 1 ( also known as Erk5 , MAPK - 1 or MAPK7 ) is a 98kDa MAPK , the last to be identified [ 109 , 110 ] ; the 98 kDa kinase is expressed in heart , skeletal muscle and placenta , but not liver , and has at least three spicing isoforms . BMK - 1 is activated by MEK5 [ 111 ] , independently of Ras [ 112 ] . BMK - 1 plays a role in vascular endothelial cell proliferation , survival and migration , as revealed by hemorrhaging in multiple organs in BMK - 1 knockout mice [ 113 ] and decreased PDGF - induced migration observed in rat aortal smooth muscle cells transfected with dominant - negative MEK5 [ 114 ] . BMK - 1 is also crucial for which is required for growth , survival and proliferation of macrophages [ 115 ] . P38MAPK . p38 α is the mammalian homologue [ 116 ] of the yeast HOG1 [ 117 ] that is activated in response to changes in osmolarity , and is ubiquitously expressed . p38 β is also widely expressed [ 118 ] , whereas p38 γ is highly expressed in skeletal muscle [ 119 , 120 ] and p38 δ in lung and kidney [ 121 ] . A splicing isoform of p38MAPK α , Exip , can bind to Toll - interacting protein [ 122 ] , conferring further complexity to p38MAPK kinase signaling . P38MAPK is activated by diverse stimuli , from growth factors , stressors , and muscle contraction . This is accomplished through trans - phosphorylation by MKK3 and / or MKK6 or 15 through auto - phosphorylation following association with TAB1 ( see Section 2 . 5 ) . Generally , stimuli that activate JNK also activate p38MAPK [ 123 ] , although exceptions exist , such that p38MAPK is activated during ischemia , and only JNK during subsequent reperfusion of heart tissue ( reviewed by [ 91 ] ) . P38MAPK has many central functions , as seen by the embryonic lethality of a whole - body p38MAPK α knockout [ 124 ] . Activated p38MAPKs have several known substrates ( see Table 1 ) that include transcription factors , cytosolic proteins involved in lipid metabolism , membrane traffic and ion transport , and several kinases . The transcription factor substrates of p38MAPK are required in the differentiation of many cell types and organs , including circulating immune cells [ 125 - 127 ] , osteoclasts [ 128 ] , skeletal muscle [ 129 - 132 ] , adipocytes [ 133 ] , intestinal cells [ 134 ] , and hepatocytes [ 135 ] . p38MAPK is a central player in growth , development and maintenance of adult tissues , in addition to its role as a stress - responsive kinase . The kinases activated by p38MAPK also have diverse functions , adding further complexity to the role of p38MAPK ( reviewed by [ 136 ] ) . p38MAPK kinase substrates such as MK2 relocate to the cytoplasm from the nucleus upon p38MAPK phosphorylation . MK2 / 3 can phosphorylate tyrosine hydroxylase ( key enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis ) , and 5 - lipoxygenase ( catalyses first steps of biosynthesis of leukotrienes ) and Hsp27 ( modulator of actin polymerization ) .

The specificity of p38MAPK function is achieved in part by particular subcellular localization and participation of scaffolding proteins . TAB1 and TAB2 , which can bind the MKKK TAK1 , act as scaffolds for p38MAPK activation [ 157 , 158 ] . Furthermore , p38MAPK phosphatases such as MKP - 1 , 5 and 7 [ 159 ] and PP2A [ 147 ] further specify p38MAPK activation , both spatially and temporally . MAPKs in insulin action Insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of JNK , Erk and p38MAPK in skeletal muscle [ 160 ] and L6 myocytes [ 161 - 163 ] of Erk and JNK [ 164 ] , but not p38MAPK [ 164 , 165 ] in isolated rat adipocytes , of p38MAPK in isolated mouse adipocytes [ 166 ] and Erk , JNK and p38MAPK in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 167 - 169 ] . Insulin also activates BMK - 1 in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 170 ] . Insulin increases expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 , in a p38MAPK - and Erk - dependent manner , respectively [ 161 ] . Importantly , a role for p38MAPK in the regulation of the glucose transport turnover rate of GLUT4 has been proposed based in studies with chemical inhibitors of p38MAPK , and this will be examined experimentally in Chapter 2 . 1 . 5 GLUT family : molecular mechanism of glucose transport GLUTs are members of the solute carrier 2 ( SLC2 ) family of glucose and polyol transporters ( reviewed by [ 171 ] ) . All 13 members of this family have 12 transmembrane regions , intracellular N - and C - termini and a single N - linked glycosylation . SCL2 members can be subdivided by sequence homology into : class I ( GLUTs 1 - 4 ) , class II ( GLUTs 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 ) and class III ( GLUTs 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 and the myo - inositol transporter ) [ 8 ] . Individual GLUTs have distinct substrate preference , kinetic properties , and tissue expression . A range of local 18 glucose concentrations occur in an organism , such as ~ 5 mM and 10 mM in the blood in the fasting and post - prandial states , respectively , and 3 mM in the cerebrospinal fluid . GLUT1 is expressed in virtually every cell type , and often its expression level correlates with the rate of cellular glucose metabolism [ 171 ] . GLUT1 is highly expressed in the blood - brain barrier , and astrocytes [ 172 ] and erythrocytes [ 173 ] . Early studies showed that the K m of hexose transport into erythrocytes , which is entirely via GLUT1 , was 1 . 6 mM [ 174 - 176 ] . Surprisingly , a K m of 26 . 2 mM for glucose transport via exogenously expressed GLUT1 was measured in Xenopus oocytes [ 177 ] . An interesting property of GLUT1 , is the trans - effect , whereby glucose on the endofacial side stimulates unidirectional transport of glucose into the cells , and vice versa ( [ 178 ] , as reviewed by [ 179 ] ) . Under zero - trans conditions ( endofacial [ glucose ] ~ 0 ) , GLUT1 exhibits relatively low K m and V max , and both parameters increase under equilibrium exchange conditions ( endofacial [ glucose ] = exofacial [ glucose ] ) , maintaining the V max / K m ratio [ 180 ] . These kinetic observations suggested cooperative models for glucose transport that will be discussed below . A recent study showed that this trans - effect is cell - type specific , and not observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae devoid of endogenous transporters but expressing GLUT1 [ 181 ] . In this system , the K m of glucose transport via GLUT1 was 3 . 1 mM [ 182 ] , and may reflect the transport kinetics of GLUT1 in the absence of additional cellular factors found in other cells such as erythrocytes and Xenopus oocytes [ 181 ] . Like GLUT4 , GLUT1 is regulated by insulin via translocation to the cell surface in muscle and fat cells in culture , although the magnitude of this effect is significantly lower than that of GLUT4 ( see Section 7 ) . Interestingly , GLUT1 partitions within detergent - resistant membranes in non - polarized mammalian cells [ 183 ] , and with caveolae - like domains in rat spermatogenic cells [ 184 ] , suggesting a localization within lipid - ordered domains . The importance of GLUT1 is further evidenced by the lethality of GLUT1 gene knockout in mouse embryos , associated with a variety of tissue malformations [ 185 , 186 ] , and by multiple mutations of GLUT1 in humans that are associated with seizures , developmental delay and microencephaly [ 187 - 191 ] , and erythrocyte defects [ 192 , 193 ] . GLUT2 is a low affinity transporter for glucose ( K m ~ 17 mM ) and other hexoses , but is a high - affinity transporter for hexosamine ( K m 0 . 8 mM ) ( reviewed by [ 171 ] ) . This transporter is expressed in the intestine and kidney to mediate trans - epithelial glucose transport . In 19 enterocytes , GLUT2 undergoes rapid translocation to the apical surface upon stimulation with glucose ( reviewed by [ 194 ] ) . This process can be modulated by L - type calcium channels , activation of sweet receptors , hormones such as insulin and GLP - 2 , and stress . Permanent relocation of GLUT2 to the apical surface of intestinal cells increased sugar absorption , and is characteristic of experimental models of insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus [ 194 ] . GLUT2 is also expressed in lung epithelial cells [ 195 ] . In addition , GLUT2 is expressed in neurons , and is essential for glucose - induced suppression of feeding by the hypothalamus [ 196 ] . In pancreatic β - cells , GLUT2 is central to sensing blood glucose levels and consequent insulin secretion ( reviewed by [ 197 ] ) . Interestingly , the large cytoplasmic loop of GLUT2 is required for sensing of extracellular glucose , suggesting that this portion of the transporter mediates binding to cytosolic factors involved in glucose turnover or sensing [ 198 ] . As well , GLUT2 is expressed in the liver and contributes to the release of glucose from hepatocytes into the bloodstream [ 199 ] . GLUT3 has high affinity for glucose transport ( K m ~ 1 . 4 mM ) and is expressed in the brain [ 200 ] , testis and spermatozoa [ 200 ] , adult neural stem cells [ 201 ] , the eye lens [ 202 ] , placenta [ 203 ] , blastocysts [ 204 ] , human platelets [ 205 ] . In skeletal muscle [ 206 ] it is expressed particularly in slow - twitch ( type I ) fibres [ 207 ] and regenerating fibres [ 208 ] . Interestingly , insulin or IGF - 1 caused a translocation of GLUT3 to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes [ 209 ] , and monocytes [ 210 ] . Moreover , depolarization of neurons [ 211 ] and PC12 cells [ 212 ] caused GLUT3 translocation to the cell surface , as did thrombin treatment of human platelets [ 205 ] . Thus , GLUT3 function is regulated via translocation to the cell surface in a variety of tissues by stimuli that may employ diverse signaling mechanisms . GLUT4 is the predominant insulin - responsive glucose transporter in muscle and fat cells , and has a K m for glucose transport of 5 - 12 mM [ 171 , 177 , 182 ] . GLUT4 exhibits a trans - effect for glucose transport kinetics , albeit less pronounced than GLUT1 [ 180 ] . Although skeletal muscles express several GLUTs , GLUT4 is the predominant glucose transporter in this tissue , as muscle - specific gene silencing of GLUT4 abolished insulin - and contraction - stimulated glucose transport into muscle and caused whole - body insulin resistance [ 13 ] . Interestingly , whole - body knockout of GLUT4 did not evoke significant defects in insulin action on glucose metabolism 20 [ 213 ] , suggesting that embryonic loss of GLUT4 in all tissues may have triggered an adaptive response during development to upregulate other glucose transporters . As discussed in Section 1 . 3 , insulin activates several parallel signaling pathways that cause translocation of pre - formed GLUT4 - containing vesicles to the cell surface , elevating the rate of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle . The membrane traffic of GLUT4 is discussed in detail in Section 1 . 6 . Insulin may also increase the intrinsic transport activity of GLUT4 ( see Chapter 2 ) . Less is known about the function of class II and III GLUTs ( reviewed by [ 171 ] ) . Based on similarity to the best characterized member , GLUT5 , class II transporters may predominantly transport fructose , with little effect on glucose . GLUT5 is expressed primarily in the jejunum , where it likely functions in fructose absorption , and is also found in the cells of the blood - brain barrier , microglia and skeletal muscle [ 214 ] . GLUT7 is expressed at the enterocyte brush border and has very high affinity transport for both glucose and fructose [ 215 ] . GLUT9 is expressed in bone cells [ 216 , 217 ] , and in kidney , liver , placenta , leukocytes , and may exhibit two different splicing variants [ 218 ] . The human GLUT11 has three spice isoforms [ 219 ] expressed in heart and slow - twitch skeletal muscle fibers [ 220 ] , although its contribution to hexose uptake is unknown ; mice and rats lack GLUT11 [ 219 ] . Class III transporters have high affinity for glucose in addition to fructose , based on the best characterized member of this group , GLUT8 which is expressed cerebellum , adrenal gland , testis , lactating mammary gland , liver , spleen , placenta , brown adipocytes , skeletal muscle and lung [ 221 - 226 ] . Importantly , GLUT8 is expressed in blastocysts , where it is regulated by insulin [ 227 ] , and loss of GLUT8 leads to increased apoptosis [ 228 ] . In neurons , GLUT8 translocates to the cell surface in response to insulin [ 225 , 229 ] . GLUT6 mRNA is expressed in brain , spleen and leucocytes , although protein expression profile is yet to be determined for [ 171 ] . Interestingly , when expressed in adipocytes , GLUT8 and GLUT6 are retained within intracellular membranes , and do not redistribute to the plasma membrane in response to insulin and other stimuli [ 230 ] . GLUT10 is expressed in heart , lung , brain , liver , skeletal muscle , pancreas , placenta and kidney [ 231 ] . Mutations in GLUT10 lead to impaired angiogenesis [ 232 ] , and GLUT10 polymorphisms are linked to insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus [ 233 - 21 236 ] . GLUT12 is expressed in spleen , skeletal muscle , placenta , heart and brown fat [ 214 , 237 - 239 ] . Upregulation of GLUT12 may be an important marker for certain types of cancer [ 240 , 241 ] , as is the case for GLUT1 [ 240 ] and GLUT3 [ 242 - 244 ] . The existence of multiple glucose transporters , each with particular transport activity , expression profiles and regulation reflects the importance of fine regulation of whole - body glucose metabolism . However , although many GLUTs have important roles , GLUT4 is the predominant insulin - responsive glucose transporter in muscle and fat , so it is paramount to understand its membrane traffic and regulation of its activity . GLUT structure and transport mechanism Mutagenesis and structure modeling studies combined with kinetic analysis of glucose transport have provided significant insight into a possible structure and catalytic mechanism of GLUT1 . This knowledge has been used as a template to predict the structure / function of other class I members such as GLUT4 . GLUT1 has alternating exofacial and endofacial hexose binding sites ( reviewed by [ 179 ] ) . These initial kinetic conclusions were supported by the discovery that phloretin and forskolin compete with glucose at the exofacial binding site , and that the non - competitive inhibitor cytochalasin B ( CB ) binds to an endofacial site ( reviewed by [ 179 ] ) . That the two glucose - binding sites ( endo - and exo - facial ) are mutually exclusive has been suggested from several studies . Mutagenesis experiments of exofacial residues S294 and T295 prevented CB binding ( endofacial ) , but not photolabeling of an exofacial glucose - binding site [ 245 , 246 ] . This suggests that 294 ST 295 is involved in catalysis , and that mutation locks the transporter in a conformation that closes the endofacial site . On the other hand , deletion of the last 26 residues in the intracellular C - terminus of GLUT1 precluded affinity photolabeling of the exofacial glucose - binding site without affecting CB binding , suggesting this transporter is locked in an inward - facing conformation [ 247 , 248 ] . Consistent with this interpretation , binding of CB prevented photolabeling of the active site of GLUT1 [ 246 ] . 22 However , the view that exo - and endo - facial binding sites are mutually exclusive has been challenged by results showing simultaneous occupation of GLUT1 by maltose , a competitive inhibitor of glucose influx and cytochalasin B . Importantly , these results could be due to formation of GLUT1 oligomers , in which subunits are functionally coupled to exhibit reciprocal conformations with respect to exposing exo - or endo - facial glucose binding sites . From radiation inactivation experiments , it was predicted that GLUT1 functions as a dimer or tetramer [ 249 - 251 ] and ultrastructure analysis by cryo - EM was also consistent with a tetramer [ 252 ] . Moreover , wild - type GLUT1 was co - immunoprecipitated using an anti - GLUT4 antibody in cells expressing a hybrid GLUT1 - GLUT4 transporter [ 173 ] . The use of GLUT1 - conformation - specific antibodies and chemical cross - linking experiments suggested that GLUT1 exists predominantly as a homo - tetramer that binds 1 mol of cytochalasin B per 2 moles of GLUT1 [ 253 ] . GLUT1 oligomers arise from disulphide bridge ( s ) , and reduction of this bond greatly inhibited glucose transport activity [ 254 ] . Furthermore , the existence of multiple , functionally linked subunits is consistent with the biphasic effect of exofacial glucose concentrations on cytochalasin B binding [ 255 ] . Thus , a homo - tetramer of GLUT1 was proposed to contain , at any instant , two subunits with exofacial glucose binding sites exposed , and two with endofacial glucose binding exposed . The transition between these states is coupled between tetramer subunits [ 256 ] . Simultaneous occupancy of both the two exofacial and two endofacial glucose binding sites of a GLUT1 tetramer may explain the increased turnover observed under equilibrium exchange conditions . In contrast , in zero - trans conditions , the endofacial glucose binding sites of a GLUT1 tetramer remain unoccupied , which may be less favourable for interconversion between inward and outward facing conformations , and thus relatively less catalysis occurs . Presumably , as the net effect of GLUT1 is to transport glucose into a cell , in vivo the transporter is expected to function under conditions more similar to zero - trans than equilibrium exchange , as the latter would represent a futile cycle of glucose transport across the cell membrane . Whether similar oligomerization occurs for other GLUTs remains unexplored , although GLUT4 does also demonstrate a trans - effect that might reflect oligomerization [ 180 ] . The residues involved in forming an exofacial glucose - binding pocket and the arrangement of transmembrane helices within GLUT1 were revealed by cysteine - scanning mutagenesis studies summarized in Table 2 . Earlier studies involving hydroxyl residues 23 derivatives of glucose had suggested that C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 and C6 are involved in hydrogen bonding to the erythrocyte transporter [ 257 ] , now known to be GLUT1 . Taken together , a model was proposed whereby the exofacial glucose binding site involves hydrogen bonding of hydroxyls on C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 and C6 of the glucose molecule with T321 ( TM8 ) , N371 ( TM8 ) , Q282 ( TM7 ) , Q161 ( TM5 ) and E380 ( TM10 ) , respectively [ 258 , 259 ] . Furthermore , the glucose permeation pathway is expected to be formed by a tubular cavity that is lined by TMs 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 with TMs 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 acting mainly to stabilize this structure [ 259 ] and perhaps contribute to conformational changes that regulate transport . Interestingly , mutation of W388 in TM10 did not affect affinity photolabeling of the exofacial glucose binding site , but increased the kinetic turnover rate , suggesting that this residue participates in the interconversion between inward to outward - facing conformations of GLUT1 , likely part of the transport process [ 260 ] . In addition , non - membrane portions of the transporter also play a role in enzymatic turnover , as mutations within the intercellular C - terminal portion of both GLUT4 and GLUT1 altered turnover rates without an effect on K m at zero - trans [ 248 , 261 ] . Similar scanning mutagenesis has been performed for GLUT3 [ 262 ] , but will not be discussed here further .

List of cysteine - scanning mutagenesis and water - accessibility studies of transmembrane ( TM ) helices of GLUT1 . For each study , the TM helix studies , along with residues that , when mutated to cysteine , either 1 ) conferred sensitivity to pCMBS ( p - chloromercuribenzene sulfonate ) , indicative of being water - accessible , 2 ) conferred sensitivity to NEM ( N - ethylmaleimide ) , indicative of being lipid - accessible , or 3 ) abrogated transport activity in the absence of pCMBS or NEM , indicative of a role in catalysis , are listed . For each helix , the proposed role and location within GLUT1 structure is also described . More recently , structures of GLUT1 have been modeled in silico based on LacY helical packing [ 272 ] , and subsequently on a combined approach of GlpT and glucose - 6 - phosphate translocase [ 273 ] . The model generated by the latter study is that of a 36 x 26 Å ( bottom ) , 46 x 27 Å ( top ) protein with a height of ~ 61 Å , which bears striking consistency with the cysteine - scanning mutagenesis model described above : a water - accessible channel that spans the membrane lined by 8 TMs , with TMs 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 positioned outside of this bundle . This channel is capped by funnel - like and horn - like openings that correspond to the exofacial and 25 endofacial glucose - binding pockets , respectively . Consistent with kinetic measurements of transport , glucose , forskolin and phloretin compete for the same binding site in the exofacial cavity , as well as in the endofacial cavity . Cytochalasin B binds via a single H - bond to a portion of the endofacial cavity about 3 Å from the glucose - forskolin - phloretin binding site , thereby occluding the glucose permeation pathway , again consistent with the kinetic analysis . The existence of an ATP binding Walker motif is also revealed in this structure , as a cavity within the glucose transport channel , and ATP binding is proposed to cause conformation changes in GLUT1 leading to non - competitive inhibition of transport activity [ 274 ] . This aspect of GLUT regulation by ATP and ATP analogues is discussed further in Section 2 . 7 . Importantly , molecular dynamic simulations ( MDS ) of this model for ~ 400 ps suggest that widening of cavities near the exofacial portion of the transporter , as may occur during glucose transport , are accompanied by structural changes in cavities proximal to the endofacial side . This is consistent with a model where occupation of one glucose - binding site precludes binding by the site across the membrane within a GLUT1 monomer . However , based on GLUT1 turnover rates of ~ 120 - 450 / s , a minimum time to see a conformational change corresponding to transport is ~ 1ms [ 275 ] , and as such a ~ 400 ps simulation could not allow observation of even a single complete transport event . Thus , understanding of molecular mechanism of catalysis awaits further structural and modeling studies . A structural model of GLUT3 was independently generated from that of a mechanosensitive ion channel MscL with considerations from aquaporin 1 , that shows consistency with the model of GLUT1 [ 276 ] . Although no such structural studies exist for GLUT4 , given the high degree of homology between GLUT1 and GLUT4 within the TM segments , it is likely that the structure of GLUT4 resembles that of GLUT1 . However , GLUT4 also exhibits structural particularities , as evidenced by selective , direct inhibition of GLUT4 , but not GLUTs 1 , 3 or 8 by the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir [ 277 ] . Peptides that mimic indinavir inhibit glucose transport via GLUT4 in a non - competitive manner , also inhibiting affinity photolabeling of the exofacial glucose binding site [ 278 ] . This suggests that like cytochalasin B , indinavir binds to an endofacial portion of GLUT4 and thereby occludes the availability of the exofacial glucose - binding site . Regulation of the intrinsic glucose transport activity of GLUT4 by insulin has been suggested by several 26 observations ( see Section 7 and understanding the possible structure - function basis of this phenomenon is probed experimentally and discussed in Chpater 2 . 1 . 6 GLUT4 membrane traffic The membrane traffic of GLUT4 within muscle and fat cells is beginning to be unraveled , through the identification of adaptors , molecular motors , membrane tethers and fusogens that mediate the movement of GLUT4 between a series of intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane . Both in basal and insulin - stimulated conditions , GLUT4 cycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments . The slow exocytosis and rapid internalization of the transporter ensures that , in the steady state , under basal conditions , ~ 10 % [ 279 ] and 3 - 5 % [ 280 ] of GLUT4 is present on the cell surface , the rest in intracellular membrane vesicles in muscle and adipocytes , respectively . About half of the intracellular GLUT4 is found on membranes that also contain TfR , in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 281 ] and L6 myoblasts ( V . Randhawa and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) and the rest resides within TfR - negative membranes that form insulin - responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles ( GSVs ) . In basal muscle cells , the preferential intracellular portioning of is achieved by a dynamic retention mechanism , in which all intracellular GLUT4 molecules are able to recycle through the plasma membrane with a relatively slow half - life [ 26 ] . Insulin increases the half - life of GLUT4 recycling , a measure of exocytosis of GSVs to the plasma membrane , thereby increasing cell surface GLUT4 . Similarly , the GLUT4 intracellular membrane pools in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes were found by McGraw and collaborators to be in dynamic exchange between TfR - positive and – negative membranes [ 282 , 283 ] . These studies led to a model where GLUT4 in recycling ( TfR - positive ) endosomes has an intermediate rate of exocytosis in the basal state . However , GLUT4 is actively sorted from the recycling membranes to the GSVs , which have a very slow rate of exocytosis in the basal state . Insulin stimulation increases the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis from GSVs . It was proposed that GSVs undergoing this dynamic , basal exchange with the plasma 27 membrane are not part of the trans - Golgi network , based on lack of ablation of GLUT4 when ablating furin - positive membrane compartments [ 283 ] . In contrast , James and collaborators found that not all GLUT4 is available to cycle to the plasma membrane in the same cells [ 284 , 285 ] . In this alternative model , GSVs undergo static retention , and , upon insulin stimulation , there is a quantal release of GSVs to the plasma membrane , based on the magnitude of the insulin stimulation . This model further proposed that GSVs are within or in dynamic exchange with portions of the TGN . This was proposed since in cells treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues from cell - surface GLUT4 , the transporter underwent re - sialation within 3 h . Further evidence of GLUT4 transit through the TGN is discussed in Chapter 4 . Recently , the difference between these contrasting models in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes was ascribed to the cell culture conditions [ 286 ] . 3T3 - L1 adipocytes that were differentiated with an accelerated process and subsequently replated 24h before experimental observation exhibited dynamic exchange of nearly all intracellular GLUT4 with the plasma membrane in the basal state , whereas 3T3 - L1 adipocytes differentiated using a longer protocol , followed by experimentation on confluent monolayers showed static basal retention of GLUT4 . Interestingly , each mechanism of GLUT4 retention achieves the same steady - state level of GLUT4 at the cell surface in the basal state . That diverse mechanisms of GLUT4 retention exist suggest that GLUT4 may have multiple , parallel and redundant sorting mechanisms , a topic that will be explored in chapter 4 . Membrane traffic of biosynthetic GLUT4 . GLUT4 is synthesized and N - linked glycosylation ( N57 ) in the ER and processed in the Golgi . Mutation of this glycosylation site resulted in decreased GLUT4 levels , perhaps due to decreased protein degradation [ 287 ] . Processing of glycosylation can involve addition of sialic acid residues in the TGN , which requires the TGN resident protein golgin - 160 [ 288 ] . From the TGN , GLUT4 is sorted directly into GSVs without needing to transit through the plasma membrane [ 289 ] , in a manner that depends on the Golgi - localizing γ - adaptin ear homology domain , ARF binding adaptors ( GGA ) [ 288 , 290 ] a C - terminal di - leucine motif on GLUT4 [ 288 ] and the large cytoplasmic loop 28 spanning TM6 - 7 [ 291 ] . Accordingly , siRNA gene silencing of golgin 160 resulted in default traffic of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane , without first reaching the GSVs , in a manner independent of GGAs [ 288 ] . P115 / transcytosis - associated a Golgi - resident protein may also participate in targeting GLUT4 to GSV , although its role remains to be defined [ 292 ] . Once in the GSVs , newly synthesized GLUT4 likely traffics indistinguishably from recycling transporters . Membrane traffic of recycling GLUT4 . The half - life of GLUT4 is relatively long , around 50 h in basal adipocytes [ 293 ] , likely as a consequence of its complex intracellular sorting . The mechanism of GLUT4 internalization from the plasma membrane is further discussed and explored experimentally in Chapter 5 . Following its internalization from the plasma membrane , GLUT4 transits , at least in part , through recycling endosomes , in a manner that overlaps with early endosomal markers EEA1 [ 26 ] requires Rab5 association with dynein and microtubules [ 294 ] , and requires the SNARE VAMP8 [ 288 ] . The EH - domain containing protein 2 ( EHD2 ) and its binding partner EHBP1 play a role in the early intracellular membrane traffic of GLUT4 and TfR , perhaps as a result of linking to the actin cytoskeleton [ 295 ] . Rab11 is also required for GLUT4 membrane traffic through the TfR - positive recycling endosomes [ 281 ] . During transit through the early and recycling endosomes , GLUT4 is dynamically sorted into GSVs . Using in vitro budding assays , small vesicles thought to be GSVs are found to be devoid of cellugyrin , whereas recycling GLUT4 membranes are cellugyrin - positive [ 296 ] , although the function and significance of this protein remains to be determined . The adaptor molecule mediating this process was proposed to be the same as biosynthetic entry of GLUT4 into GSVs , namely GGAs [ 290 , 297 ] . However , as dominant negative GGA mutant ( VHS - GAT ) inhibited basal GLUT4 retention and insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation only when expressed prior to the transporter , GGA may only function to sort GLUT4 during its biosynthesis [ 289 ] . The insulin responsive amino peptidase ( IRAP ) , that traffics indistinguishably from GLUT4 , may contain motifs required for proper sorting of GLUT4 to GSVs , as loss of IRAP reduces insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , but not vice - versa [ 298 ] . Moreover , siRNA gene silencing of the IRAP partner tankyrase [ 298 ] , prevents insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , possibly due to improper sorting of GLUT4 to GSVs . Sortilin was also proposed to 29 participate in GLUT4 sorting into GSV by binding to luminal domains of IRAP and GLUT4 [ 299 , 300 ] . However , substitution of the luminal domain of IRAP with that of TfR , or endofacial regions of GLUT1 with that of GLUT4 , results in membrane traffic of the hybrid proteins indistinguishable from that of wild - type IRAP or GLUT4 [ 301 , 302 ] . Hence , luminal regions of GLUT4 and IRAP are dispensable for proper sorting GLUT4 and IRAP to GSVs and make a role for sortilin in this process unlikely [ 297 ] . The protein adaptor linking entry of GLUT4 into GSVs remains to be identified , and a possible role for clathrin in this process is discussed in Chapter 6 . The involvement of the SNARE VAMP2 has been demonstrated for entry of GLUT4 into GSVs [ 288 ] and subsequent insulin - stimulated fusion of GSVs with the PM , making this protein a likely resident of GSVs . SNARE proteins are described in more detail in Chapter 4 . Regulated stages of GLUT4 membrane traffic . A complex signaling network operates downstream of this insulin receptor ( see section 1 . 3 ) , and where these signals impinge on GLUT4 traffic is an important , unresolved question . Some have proposed that insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis is due to an increased mobilization or mass of movement of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell periphery , also termed GLUT4 “arrival” ( Figure 4 ) . Insulin accelerates the intra - endosomal traffic of GLUT4 vesicles though EEA1 - positive and TfR - positive recycling endosomes [ 26 ] . Although the rate of movement of GLUT4 to the PM along cytoskeletal tracks , comprised of both actin and microtubules , is not affected by insulin , the amount of vesicles undergoing this process is increased by insulin [ 58 ] . Furthermore , the kinesin motors KIF5B and / or KIF3 may mediate this process along microtubules [ 83 , 303 ] . Stimulation of 3T3 - L1 adipocytes with insulin at 19 C results in movement of GLUT4 - containing vesicles towards the cell periphery in the absence of Akt activation , but does not result increase in cell surface - association of GLUT4 [ 304 ] . The protein TUG , which binds to GLUT4 in the basal state , may be an intracellular GLUT4 tether , and this interaction decreases in response to insulin , thereby allowing mobilization of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell periphery [ 305 , 306 ] . Whether or not it represents a regulated step , the requirement for movement of GLUT4 from the perinuclear region to the periphery could imply participation of microtubules . Consistent with this finding , disruption of the microtubule network with nocodazole reduced insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 307 ] and reduced vectorial movement of GLUT4 to the 30 cell periphery [ 303 ] . However , others have found that disruption of microtubules had no effect on insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 308 - 310 ] . Interestingly , disruption of the microtubule network resulted in loss of insulin - stimulated Akt phosphorylation [ 311 ] , suggesting that microtubules may play a role in mediated insulin signaling , and not GLUT4 membrane traffic per se . Currently , the discrepancy between these findings is unclear . It is possible that after vectorial transport along microtubules , GLUT4 vesicles are captured by the cortical actin mesh . This may be a stage necessary for subsequent tethering , docking and fusion with the membrane . Figure 4 . Diagram depicting stages of GLUT4 exocytosis regulated by insulin . Mobilization . GLUT4 vesicles can be transported to the cell periphery by KIF5B / 3 along microtubules ( red ) . Tethering . GLUT4 vesicles are retained near the cell periphery through specific interactions , via actinin 4 ( ACTN4 ) , with the remodeled actin cytoskeleton ( blue ) or with the exocyst complex . Docking . Stable , reversible binding of GLUT4 vesicles by plasma membrane - bound components such as VAMP2 and Rab proteins is increased by insulin . Fusion . Irreversible fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane is enhanced by insulin through action on SNARE proteins and Munc18c . Also shown are signals elicited by insulin , and the stages that they may regulate : PI3P , phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ; PIP3 , phosphatidylinositol - ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate . Reproduced with permission from Biochemical Journal ( 2008 ) ; 413 : 201 - 15 31 Several findings suggest that docking or tethering of GLUT4 near the PM and subsequent fusion of the transporter with the PM are the major , although separate , regulated stages of GLUT4 membrane traffic by insulin . Tethering , as used there , refers to the increased localization of GLUT4 near the PM either through stable binding to PM - proximal anchors , such as actin cytoskeleton or the membrane itself , or preferential dynamic partitioning within membrane compartments near the PM ( within ~ 200 - 500 nM ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) studies revealed that insulin does not affect the movement of GLUT4 to PM - proximal regions , suggesting that insulin only alters the transporter’s retention close to the PM [ 311 ] . Insulin stimulates production of both PI3P and PIP 3 [ 312 ] , and inhibition of PIP 3 but not PI3P production allows in GLUT4 to associate with the PM ( determined using PM lawns ) without however fusing with it [ 313 ] . Inhibition of production of both phospho - inositides prevented both events . These results are consistent with a PI3P - regulated stage of GLUT4 vesicle docking / tethering at the PM and PIP 3 regulating the fusion step . However , Xu & col . [ 314 ] have suggested that the insulin regulated tethering of GLUT4 vesicles is dependent on class I PI3K - mediated phosphorylation of AS160 , which would implicate PIP 3 in tethering . Proposed insulin - regulated tethers involved in GLUT4 exocytosis include a remodeled actin cytoskeleton and related binding proteins such as actinin 4 ( V . Randhawa , I . Talior and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , and the exocyst component Exo70 [ 315 ] . The exocyst complex may be linked to subsequent GLUT4 vesicle fusion by snapin , a ubiquitous protein that also interacts with SNAP23 [ 316 ] . Importantly , RNAi gene silencing of snapin reduced insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis . However , the participation of the exocyst complex was questioned by recent findings that interference with this complex had no effect on insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation [ 317 ] . Thus , the molecular roles of these putative insulin - regulated GLUT4 plasma membrane tethers is yet to be resolved , and may include parallel , partly redundant mechanisms . Aside from tethering at or near the PM , molecular docking and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the PM also represents an important insulin - regulated process . GSV fusion with the PM requires the SNARES VAMP2 on GSVs and syntaxin4 and SNAP23 [ 318 , 319 ] . In a reconstituted in vitro membrane fusion reaction , the fold increase in GLUT4 - vesicle fusion with PM - derived membranes approximates that of the fold increase in cell surface GLUT4 by insulin [ 320 ] . Similarity , using TRIF - microscopy , tethering / immobilization rates increase by 50 % , 32 whereas vesicle fusion was increased 6 - fold following insulin stimulation , and the latter was PI3K - AS160 independent [ 314 ] . Moreover , using a pH - sensitive reporter ( IRAP linked to pHlorin ) which exhibits increased fluorescence at the extracellular medium , a ~ 40 - fold increase in membrane fusion of GLUT4 was observed in response to insulin , whereas the PI3K - AS160 signaling pathway only contributed to membrane docking / tethering [ 321 ] . Possible insulin - regulated targets that affect GLUT4 membrane fusion may include VAMP2 , which is phosphorylated in response to insulin [ 84 ] , although the consequence of the phosphorylation of this important SNARE is unknown . Munc18c , by binding to syntaxin 4 [ 322 ] , prevents syntaxin 4 binding to VAMP2 [ 323 ] and SNAP23 [ 324 ] and blocks vesicle fusion [ 325 ] . This munc18c - syntaxin 4 interaction is dissociated upon stimulation with insulin [ 326 ] , allowing for GSV fusion with the PM . The conformational changes in syntaxin 4 that follows dissociation from munc18c is sufficient for insulin - stimulated GLUT4 fusion [ 326 ] . Interestingly , while exogenous PI3P promotes in movement of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell periphery without subsequent fusion in adipocytes from wild - type mice , fusion was observed in munc18c - / - mice [ 327 ] . This suggests that munc18c may be a regulated inhibitor of fusion . B - tomosyn , like munc18c , binds to syntaxin 4 and SNAP23 competitively with VAMP2 [ 328 ] , and may also negatively regulate GLUT4 vesicle fusion . Furthermore , synip , a syntaxin 4 - interacting protein [ 329 ] , is phosphorylated by insulin downstream of Akt2 , and this phosphorylation is required for insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis [ 330 ] . However , the role of synip in GLUT4 exocytosis has been questioned , based on lack of effect of an Akt - phosphorylation - deficient mutant on insulin - simulated GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 331 ] . Hence , several stages in GLUT4 traffic may be regulated by insulin . From current knowledge , the docking stage of GLUT4 exocytosis is the major target of insulin signaling downstream of Akt - AS160 . This is attractive since AS160 is a GAP - Rab and Rab proteins can regulate docking / tethering of vesicles with target membranes [ 332 ] . The possibility that insulin regulates of GLUT4 endocytosis is discussed and explored experimentally in Chapter 5 . 33 1 . 7 Stimulation of glucose uptake by muscle contraction In addition to insulin , other stimuli increase in glucose uptake into muscle , most notably muscle contraction . Seminal work done in frog muscle in the 1960’s showed a ~ 20 - fold increase in glucose transport rate in isolated frog sartorius muscles upon stimulation with electrical contraction [ 333 ] , and an early link was made to Ca 2 + entry into muscle [ 334 ] . Mammalian muscle contraction has been studied in rodent muscles , predominantly rat epitrochlearis and gastrocnemius , and mouse extensor digitorum longum ( EDL ) and soleus , stimulated to contract in vivo or ex vivo . Furthermore , muscle contraction has been studied in the perfused rat hindlimb model first characterized by Ruderman & col . [ 335 ] , in which a partially isolated rat hindquarter is perfused with a semi - synthetic medium containing human erythrocytes , and glucose removed from perfusion medium is an index of the rate of uptake into hindlimb muscles . Importantly , as is the case for insulin , muscle contraction leads to the redistribution of GLUT4 to the PM [ 336 ] , and this transporter is required for the increased glucose uptake following contraction , as seen by the absence of contraction - stimulated glucose uptake in GLUT4 - null muscle [ 13 ] . Intriguingly , the intracellular membrane pools of GLUT4 taxed by exercise and insulin are not the same [ 336 ] . Furthermore , contraction - stimulated increases in glucose uptake into muscle do not employ the same signaling intermediates as insulin , as there is a lack of sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin [ 337 - 340 ] , and no activation of Akt [ 339 ] for contraction - stimulated glucose transport ( see Table 3 ) . Moreover , contraction - stimulated glucose uptake is additive to that of insulin [ 341 , 342 ] , consistent with each engaging distinct mechanisms of regulating the amount of cell surface GLUT4 . Ca 2 + influx into muscle during contraction correlates with the magnitude of stimulation of the rate of glucose uptake [ 334 ] , suggesting that Ca 2 + that enters the muscle upon depolarization is a signal for glucose entry . Depolarization of the muscle by high [ K + ] medium resulted in a similar increase in glucose uptake into frog skeletal muscle as electrical stimulation , which was sensitive to dantrolene [ 343 ] , an inhibitor of the ryanodine receptor that prevents Ca 2 + release of from the SR / ER [ 344 ] . A similar phenomenon was observed in L6 myotubes which are devoid of 34 a contractile apparatus , suggesting that Ca 2 + signals to increase glucose uptake via GLUT4 independently of contraction itself [ 345 ] . Calmodulin ( CaM ) is a 148 amino acid protein that binds to intracellular calcium and alters the function of intracellular proteins [ 346 ] . CaM - regulated protein kinases ( CaMK ) are a family of S / T protein kinases that include phosphorylase kinase , myosin light chain kinase , and CaMKI , II , III and IV . Inhibitors of CaMKs , particularly of CaMKII , KN62 and KN93 [ 347 ] , partly inhibit contraction - stimulated glucose uptake , suggesting that CaMKs may mediate calcium signaling to glucose uptake [ 348 ] . However , care must be taken when considering pharmacological studies , as KN93 has been shown to directly inhibit L - type calcium channels ( CaV1 . 3 and CaV1 . 2 ) [ 349 ] . CaMKII is activated by contraction in rat [ 348 ] and human [ 350 ] muscle . Thus , the possible participation of CaMKs in contraction - stimulated glucose uptake remains to be explored with more specific methodologies . Another possible signal of increased intracellular Ca 2 + is protein kinase C ( PKC ) . The PKC family is composed of several classes [ 351 ] , the first identified being the conventional ( cPKC ) , that bind to and are activated by diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and Ca 2 + , by virtue of harboring C1 and C2 domains , respectively , and include PKC α , β 1 , β 2 and γ . Novel PKCs ( nPKC ) lack a C2 domain and are thus directly activated by DAG but not calcium , and include PKC δ , ε , η , and θ . Atypical PKCs lack both a C1 and C2 domain and include PKC λ , ζ and PK - N1 and PK - N2 . Notably , DAG can be produced by Ca 2 + - activated phospholipases ( phosphatidylinositol - PLCs ) [ 352 ] , making the DAG - activated nPKCs a possible mediator of Ca 2 + signals , in addition to the cPKCs , which can be activated by both DAG and Ca 2 + directly . Interestingly , bis - indolylmaleimide ( BIM ) , an inhibitor of PKCs , reduced the Ca 2 + - dependent increase in cell surface GLUT4 and glucose uptake elicited by K + - induced depolarization [ 345 ] . Also , calphostin C , another inhibitor of PKC , reduced contraction - stimulated glucose uptake [ 353 ] . Several studies have reported that phorbol - 12 - myrystate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , which can act as an intracellular analogue of DAG , when administered to cells increases cell surface GLUT4 in muscle [ 25 ] and adipocytes [ 354 - 357 ] . Together , these results offer evidence that PKCs can elicit a redistribution of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores . Further 35 experiments specifically testing the role of PKCs as mediators of Ca 2 + signals elicited by contraction will clarify the role of this kinase in contraction - simulated glucose uptake . In addition to increases in intracellular Ca 2 + , contraction evokes other signals , notably the reduction in intracellular [ ATP ] [ 15 ] . Reduced ATP / AMP ratio is sensed by AMP - activated protein kinase , AMPK , a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic α subunit , and β and γ subunits . The latter senses intracellular AMP via a series of cystathione β synthase domains ( CBS ) , which , upon binding to AMP undergo a conformational shift that exposes the catalytic subunit found in the α - subunit [ 358 ] , allowing the α - subunit to become phosphorylated at T172 by upstream kinases LKB [ 359 ] or CaMKK [ 360 ] , resulting in AMPK activation . Accordingly , AMPK is activated during contraction [ 361 , 362 ] . A role for AMPK in contraction - stimulated glucose uptake was suggested based on studies with transgenic mice expressing AMPK mutants [ 363 ] or AMPK α 1 / 2 null animals [ 364 ] . This sensitivity was muscle - type specific [ 364 ] . It is possible that the extent of AMPK involvement in contraction - stimulated glucose uptake varies between muscles types as well as contraction conditions . To study the role of activated AMPK independently of muscle contraction , the drug 5 - amino - 4 - imidazolecarboxamide riboside ( AICAR ) is often used . AICAR is rapidly taken in to cells and converted to the cell - impermeant AMP analogue 5 - amino - 4 - imidazolecarboxamide ribotide ( ZMP ) which activates AMPK and stimulates glucose uptake in primary muscle [ 337 , 361 - 365 ] and L6 myocytes [ 25 , 345 ] , in a manner that requires AMPK ( see Table 3 ) . Furthermore , reductions in the intracellular ATP / AMP ratio can be achieved by treatment with hypoxic conditions or with the mitochondrial uncoupler 2 , 4 - dinitrophenol ( DNP ) [ 366 ] . However , decreases in cellular ATP may reduce the activity of the N + / K + - ATPase [ 367 ] , thereby additionally leading to membrane depolarization and increased intracellular Ca 2 + in hypoxic and DNP - treated cells . Consistently , DNP treatment , in addition to activation of AMPK , results in an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + [ 368 ] . Increased intracellular Ca 2 + and AMPK may thus represent separate , parallel arms of signaling elicited by muscle contraction and mitochondrial uncouplers . Consistent with this interpretation , the stimulations of glucose uptake elicited by caffeine ( which increases 36 intracellular Ca 2 + ) and AICAR were additive [ 348 ] . Furthermore , the Ca 2 + - dependent increase in glucose uptake elicited by K + - induced membrane depolarization was not affected by siRNA gene silencing of AMPK [ 345 ] . Recently , the Rab - GAP AS160 , that plays a role in insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , was proposed to be a molecular integrator of PKC and AMPK signaling . In L6 myoblasts , both activators of c / nPKCs ( DAG ) and AMPK ( AICAR ) elicit phosphorylation of AS160 , and preventing this phosphorylation blunted the cell surface gain in GLUT4 elicited by each stimulus [ 25 ] . AS160 is also phosphorylated by muscle contraction [ 369 - 371 ] in part through AMPK [ 371 ] , a process required for contraction - stimulated glucose uptake [ 372 ] . Interestingly , AS160 contains a putative CaM - binding domain that is also required for contraction - stimulated glucose uptake , suggesting a mechanism whereby AS160 may integrate Ca 2 + inputs elicited by muscle contraction for stimulation of glucose uptake [ 373 ] . As well , another Rab - GAP related to AS160 , Tbc1d1 , is also phosphorylated in response to insulin , AICAR and contraction , yet its function remains to be defined . A recent study performed in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes showed that overexpression of Tbc1d1 blunted insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , and this could be partly reversed by AICAR treatment [ 374 ] . Thus , although both AS160 and Tbc1d1 may play a role in contraction - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , their precise contribution remains to be elucidated . 37 Muscle type Fold stim .

Reprinted with permission from Can J Diabetes 2006 ; 30 : 80 - 88 The mechanism by which Ca 2 + , AMPK and / or other signals elicited by muscle contraction impinge on GLUT4 membrane traffic resulting in an increase in cell surface GLUT4 remains unclear . That the intracellular membrane pools of GLUT4 taxed by exercise and insulin differ [ 336 ] suggests distinct loci of action by the two stimuli , even if the AS160 acts as a signal integrator of insulin and contraction signals . Interestingly , the inhibitor of ATP production in the mitochondria oligomycin , which activates AMPK , and K + - induced membrane depolarization reduced GLUT4 internalization in cardiomyocytes and L6 myotubes , respectively [ 345 , 383 ] . These observations suggest that contraction may increase cell surface GLUT4 via a reduced rate of endocytosis of the transporter . However , little is known about the mechanism of internalization of the GLUT4 in muscle , and this is the subject of experiments described in Section 5 . 39 1 . 8 Mechanisms of Endocytosis The process of internalizing proteins from the cell surface is essential for the maintenance of cell shape , volume and defense . Membrane internalization also participates in cellular processes such signal transmission , uptake of nutrients and maintenance of cell surface area and volume . Early studies at the end of the 19 th century , performed by Metchnikoff , showed that litmus particles ingested by cells change color , reflecting internalization to acidified membrane compartments . Subsequently , Lewis coined the term pinocytosis to describe this process [ 384 ] . Some of the first electron microscopy studies suggested the existence of coated pits internalizing yolk proteins by eggs [ 385 ] , which led to the identification of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) as a major route of cellular internalization ( reviewed by [ 386 ] ) . Since the early 1990’s however , there have been other , non - clathrin routes of internalization described that make the process of endocytosis a very complex , highly specific , regulated , and also likely interconnected phenomenon . Each mechanism of internalization shares some basic biophysical features and requirements : having to overcome the entropic cost of concentrating cargo molecules within a small area of the plasma membrane , and then having to overcome the high enthalpic cost of curving membranes , followed by other energetically costly stages such as membrane bud constriction and scission . In addition , the recruitment of the machinery required for subsequent targeting of the nascent vesicle to the proper endomembranes likely occurs concomitantly to membrane budding . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) Clathrin - mediated endocytosis centrally requires the 180 kDa protein clathrin - heavy chain ( CHC ) , first identified in 1979 by Pearse [ 387 ] , which together with clathrin light chain , forms a three - armed star - like structure called a triskelion , composed of 3 subunits of each of CHC and CLC , the basic unit of higher clathrin assemblies ( reviewed by [ 388 ] ) . Clathrin triskelia can in turn self - assemble into ball - like polymers of well - defined , 120nm - diameter 40 structures , which , in the context of membrane budding , acts to coat a nascent vesicle , called a clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) . As such , clathrin itself represents a central adaptor that can recruit numerous additional proteins essential for the process of clathrin - mediated internalization . A summary of the proteins implicated in CME is provided in Table 4 . The initial stage of production of a CCV is the formation of the clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) in the plasma membrane . Through binding to specific cargo molecules within the plasma membrane , such as the Transferrin Receptor ( TfR ) , clathrin adaptors also recruit clathrin to the PM ( reviewed by [ 388 ] ) . A well known adaptor molecule for CME is the heterotetramer AP - 2 , which is composed of adaptin α  , β2 , μ2 and σ2 , and is part of a larger family of AP complexes that mediate membrane budding throughout the cell [ 389 ] . Selective targeting of AP - 2 to the PM is thought to be , at least in part , due to the direct binding of PM - localized phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) by AP - 2 and other accessory proteins . In keeping with this idea , transient ablation of PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inhibits clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 390 ] . Initial formation of a CCP involves buildup of a local concentration of cargo - AP - 2 - clathrin complexes within a shallow membrane invagination [ 391 ] . At this stage , several clathrin - associated proteins are likely also found in the CCP , although their temporal requirement during the budding process remains unexplored ( see Table 4 ) . CCPs mature by further invagination followed by scission from the plasma membrane , as a result of having recruited the GTPase dynamin , yielding CCVs . Cargo molecules , by virtue of being localized within CCP invaginations via their interaction with adaptors , become localized within CCVs . Many proteins play a role in the formation of mature CCVs , their roles are described below ( see Table 4 ) . Of note , several can both sense and create membrane curvature by virtue of possessing ENTH , ANTH , BAR and F - FAR domains , such as AP180 / CALM , syndapin , epsin , amphiphysin , and endophilin . These proteins have been proposed to facilitate membrane curvature during formation of a CCP . As discussed below , dynamin is proposed to function as both a mechanochemical force generator for membrane scission , as well as a conventional , regulatory GTPase akin to the Rho family [ 392 , 393 ] . A role for remodeled actin has been demonstrated for movement of newly formed CCVs away from the PM , as well as in closing of the neck of the CCP prior to the action of dynamin [ 394 ] , however , others have disputed such a role for actin , suggesting instead a role for actin only in CCP 41 nucleation [ 395 ] . Given the requirement of proteins that can remodel actin ( see Table 4 ) , it seems likely that actin plays a role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Accessory adaptors and specialized CME . In addition to the canonical clathrin cargo motifs [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] and YXX φ recognized by the µ2 subunit and µ2 β - subunit interface , respectively [ 396 ] , of AP - 2 , other cargo motifs are recognized by additional accessory adaptors for CME . Adaptors in this case are defined as proteins that can simultaneously bind to cargo molecules and components of the clathrin assembly [ 397 ] . Epsin binds to ubiquitinylated proteins , and is required for the internalization of ubiquitinylated cargo , for which AP - 2 is dispensable [ 398 ] . Numb , Dab2 and ARH recognize a FXPXY motif ( reviewed by [ 396 ] ) , and Dab2 can function as an adaptor for LDL - R , that functions independently of AP - 2 and ARH [ 399 ] . Furthermore , β - arrestin may act as an adaptor for agonist - promoted G - protein coupled receptors , linking to AP - 2 and thus CME [ 400 ] . The internalization of the GluR - containing AMPA receptor is defective in HIP1 - / - mice [ 401 ] , suggesting HIP1 may play a specific role in the internalization of this cargo . In addition to various CME cargo being recognized by distinct adaptors , these adaptors may demarcate distinct CCPs . TfR and LDL - R , that require AP - 2 and Dab2 , respectively , internalize through distinct structures as seen by TIRF - M [ 402 ] . Furthermore , the CCPs formed upon treatment with β 2 - receptor agonists , rich in β - arrestin coupled to β 2 - receptors , form a biochemically distinct population than transferrin - containing pits [ 403 ] . In addition , overexpression of the adaptor - associated kinase AAK1 inhibited TfR and LRP endocytosis , but not that of the EGFR , although all were clathrin - dependent possibly as a result of sequestration of AP - 2 away from CCPs [ 404 ] . These results suggest that CME may itself be subdivided into several distinct endocytic pathways , each requiring a core clathrin assembly , yet differing in “accessory” machinery and adaptors . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis can function for constitutive internalization as well as upon stimulation . 42 Protein Proposed function Other ref Clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) Central protein - binding platform , assembles cargo adaptors and endocytic machinery , essential for all CME Can self - assemble into clathrin lattices , binds many other CCP proteins [ 388 , 396 , 397 ] Clathrin light chain ( CLC ) Dispensable for some CME , binds to HIP , and HIP1R Possible negative regulation of clathrin lattice assembly [ 405 - 407 ] AP - 2 complex Binds to specific cargo , recruits cargo to nascent clathrin - coated pit , required for many CME cargo , specifically TfR Binds clathrin , many other CHC proteins [ 396 ] dynamin Mechanochemical GTPase required for membrane scission , Regulatory GTPase required for recruitment of other proteins Can tabulate and scission membranes in vitro [ 392 , 393 , 408 - 410 ] ARH Binds to CHC and AP - 2 , recruits cargo to clathrin - coated pits Important for LDL - R internalization [ 411 ] Dab2 Binds to specific cargo , recruits cargo to nascent clathrin - coated pit , required for LDL - R internalization Required for LDL - R internalization , independent of AP - 2 and ARH [ 399 , 412 ] Numb Binds AP - 2 in a phosphorylation - dependent manner [ 413 ] CALM / AP180 Binds to CHC , aids clathrin assembly , has ANTH - domain that binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , coordinates coat assembly Bind to membranes independent of AP - 2 [ 414 ] [ 415 , 416 ] Eps15 / Eps15R Binds intersectin , AP - 2 , epsin , synaptojanin , required for many forms of CME [ 417 ] Rab5 Required for internalization of TfR , EGFR Targeting nascent vesicles to early endosomes [ 406 ] Intersectin Binds dynamin , has DH , PH and C2 domains , recruits N - WASP May control amount of dynamin recruited to clathrin pits [ 418 ] [ 419 , 420 ] syndapin Phosphorylation - dependent binding to amphiphysin , endophilin , and dynamin , has F - BAR domain [ 421 ] Epsin Binds to CHC , has ENTH - domain that binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , has ubiquitin - binding motifs [ 422 ] Bind to membranes independently of AP - 2 , drives membrane curvature [ 423 ] [ 417 ] SNX9 Couples to actin assembly via binding to N - WASP , binds dynamin 1 ; harbors PX , BAR domains [ 424 , 425 ] AAK1 Kinase that phosphorylates μ 2 subunit of AP - 2 , increases rate of [ 426 ] 43 cargo recruitment CVAK104 Kinase that phosphorylates β - subunit of AP2 Recruitment of SNAREs syntaxin 8 and Vtib to CCV [ 427 ] [ 428 ] Auxilin - 2 / GAK , auxillin - 1 and Hsp70 Kinase Required for clathrin subunit exchange during CCP assembly , free clathrin triskelion chaperone to prevent cytosolic aggregation Also required for uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles following membrane scission [ 429 ] amphiphysin Binds membranes via BAR domain , binds CHC , AP - 2 ear domain , synaptojanin , dynamin , Can tubulate liposomes in vitro [ 417 ] synaptojanin Contains two inositol phosphatase domains , degrades PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 430 ] , also binds to endophilin , amphiphysin , syndapin , intersectin Regulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 critical for CME [ 390 ] [ 431 , 432 ] Endophilin Binds synaptojanin via N - terminal SH3 domain , binds dynamin and harbors BAR domain Can bind and invaginate lipid bilayers in vitro [ 432 , 433 ] Cortactin Binds dynamin , and N - WASP , recruits actin polymerization machinery to CCPs , essential for TfR internalization [ 434 , 435 ] Arf6 Recruits AP2 to membranes in vitro in the absence of phosphoinositides , essential for TfR internalization Controls recruitment of AP - 2 and clathrin in stimulated ATR internalization [ 436 ] [ 437 ] β - arrestin Binds to GPCR cargo and recruits to CCPs [ 438 ] HIP1 Binds to SH3 domain of cortactin , binds CLC , enhance clathrin assembly in vitro [ 407 , 439 ] HIP1 / R Binds to SH3 domain of cortactin , binds CLC , enhance clathrin assembly in vitro regulates actin filament assembly by blocking actin filament barbed end elongation [ 407 , 440 ] Table 4 . Proteins that participate in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Listed are proteins proposed to play a role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , as well as their proposed function and other observation ( s ) . Abbreviations : ANTH : AP180 N - terminal homology ; ENTH , Epsin N - terminal homology ; BAR : Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ; ATR , angiotensin II receptor ; dab2 , disabled 2 ; HIP , huntingtin - interacting protein ; As there are a large number of known clathrin cargo molecules , CME plays a central role in the regulation of many fundamental processes ( reviewed by [ 388 ] ) . CME controls intracellular 44 communication during development , as well as many signaling pathways during adulthood , by modulating the availability of cell surface receptors and other signaling molecules . CME plays a particularly important role in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , and hence many clathrin accessory proteins listed in Table 4 are either exclusive to the brain or have brain - specific isoforms [ 417 ] . In the brain , clathrin is required for recycling of synaptic vesicles and controls the magnitude of synaptic transmission ( reviewed by [ 388 ] ) . CME also controls the cell surface availability of numerous nutrient transporters and pumps . Caveolar internalization Vesicular or tubular membrane invagination is likely a hallmark of all endocytic routes . Membrane invaginations of 50 - 100 nm in diameter that are distinct from CCPs [ 441 ] were termed caveolae , or “little “caves” , and have been described since the 1950’s [ 442 , 443 ] . Caveolae lack a protein coat analogous to CCPs when examined by electron microscopy , so the formation of caveolae is not analogous to clathrin vesicle budding [ 442 ] . Caveolae are very stable structures assembled in the ER , that traffic to and from several membrane compartments , including the plasma membrane [ 444 , 445 ] . Caveolae have a few known resident proteins , the most prominent of which was separately called caveolin [ 446 ] or VIP21 [ 447 ] , which were later found to be the same protein [ 448 ] . There are three isoforms of caveolin ( cav1 - 3 ) of 18 - 24 kDa [ 442 ] : caveolin 1 and 2 are ubiquitous , but caveolin 3 is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle [ 449 , 450 ] , cardiomyocytes [ 450 ] , L6 myocytes [ 451 ] and some smooth muscle cells [ 450 ] . Synthesized in the ER , caveolins contain a membrane - insertion domain , a cholesterol - binding domain , tyrosine phosphorylation and palmitoylation motifs , as well as a oligomerization motif . In cells and in vitro , caveolae assemble into approximately 200 - 400 kDa complexes containing 14 - 16 caveolin monomers . In turn , an individual caveolae is thought to contain approximately 144 caveolin proteins [ 452 ] . Caveolins are essential for formation of caveolae , as genetic loss of caveolin 1 or 3 perturbs formation of caveolae in multiple tissues [ 453 ] and skeletal muscle [ 454 ] , respectively . Furthermore , siRNA gene silencing of caveolin - 1 results in loss of cell surface caveolae [ 455 ] . 45 Caveolin is sufficient for formation of caveolae , as expression of caveolin 1 in cells lacking caveolin 1 and caveolae is sufficient to form caveolae [ 456 - 458 ] . Caveolin - 2 binds to cav1 and cav3 , and thereby facilitates oligomerization , but cav - 2 is unable to form caveolae in the absence of cav1 or 3 [ 451 ] . Importantly , caveolin - 3 forms a tight complex with caveolin - 1 and both strictly co - localize , suggesting that cav - 3 specific caveolae are unlikely [ 451 ] . Instead , all isoforms of caveolin are likely found within all expressed caveolin oligomers and caveolae . Additional molecules that are required for formation of caveolae have been recently identified . The ganglioside GM1 , which is synthesized in the ER and then travels to the PM via a membrane traffic route that requires syntaxin - 6 , is required for appearance or formation of caveolae on the cell surface [ 459 ] . Accordingly , loss of syntaxin - 6 results in loss of cell - surface caveolae and caveolin proteins and decreased PM cholesterol , which is normally delivered to the PM by binding to caveolins . Addition of GM1 to the cell surface resulted in reappearance of caveolin proteins and caveolae at the cell surface [ 459 ] . Furthermore , PTRV - Cavin is a caveolar coat protein associated with caveolin - 1 and loss of this protein perturbs caveolae [ 460 ] and results in loss of caveolin - 1 expression [ 461 ] . However , PTRF - Cavin is not part of the stable oligomeric caveolin complex [ 461 ] . The role of PTRV - Cavin in caveolae formation , in molecular terms , is yet to be determined , and other protein and lipid players may also be involved . Caveolae perform multiple functions including lipid sensing and storage , and forming platforms for specific membrane - associated signaling pathways in many cell types ( reviewed by [ 443 ] ) . Furthermore , caveolae act as mechano - sensing platforms , specifically for sensing flow as well as stretch in endothelial cells . Importantly , caveolae are required for some forms of endocytosis . Although first recognized in the internalization of certain pathogens [ 462 ] , caveolae also function in the internalization of endogenous membrane proteins and lipids [ 443 ] . That caveolae are bona fide endocytic structures was first supported by observation of formation of caveolae - derived vesicles from purified membranes , upon addition of nucleotides and cytosol in a cell free , in vitro system [ 463 ] . Caveolae are required for the internalization of β 1 - integrins in human fibroblasts [ 464 ] , and of A1 adenosine receptors in a smooth muscle cell lines [ 465 ] . Furthermore , the internalization of the glutamate transporter EACC1 requires caveolae in C6 46 glioma cells , and is disrupted upon expression of a dominant negative mutant of caveolin - 1 ( S80E ) [ 466 ] . In addition , caveolae mediate the internalization of transforming growth factor – β receptor , ( TGF β− R ) [ 467 ] and ubiquitinated epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) [ 468 ] under some conditions . Caveolae may also be involved in the internalization of the cannabinoid anandamide [ 469 ] . An important marker of caveolae is the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide , ( LacCer ) . A fluorescently - tagged version of this lipid ( BODIPY - LacCer ) depends on caveolin expression [ 458 ] and PM localization [ 459 ] for internalization and is localized uniquely to caveolin - 1 - positive membranes upon endocytosis [ 458 ] . Caveolins have important roles in metabolism . Caveolin - 1 knockout mice exhibit a lean phenotype and are protected from diet - induced obesity [ 470 ] . Interestingly , caveolin - 3 , and possibly other isoforms , become enriched in developing t - tubules during muscle differentiation [ 471 ] . The loss of caveolin - 3 disrupts t - tubules , and the term caveolinopathies has been coined to describe four distinct muscle diseases in humans that result from disruption of caveolin - 3 function in muscle [ 472 ] . Importantly , caveolin - 3 knockout mice exhibit insulin resistance , associated with a decreased insulin - stimulated phosphorylation of the IR , IRS and Akt , implicating cav - 3 in modulation of the insulin signaling pathway in muscle in vivo , perhaps by acting as a platform or scaffold for signaling molecules [ 473 ] . Another study observed dramatically reduced levels of IR protein in Cav3 - null mice , suggesting instead that cav - 3 is important for IR stability [ 474 ] . The precise contribution of caveolar internalization in regulation of metabolism remains unclear . The possible contribution of caveolae to internalization of GLUT4 is examined in Chapter 5 . The mechanism of caveolar internalization is less clear than that of CME , although several studies show it is highly regulated . Specifically , a common mechanism involving Src kinases , protein kinase C , actin recruitment , and the phosphorylation of Y14 on caveolin - 1 , are required for internalization via caveolae , which makes caveolar endocytosis sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors , and stimulated by inhibitors of protein phosphatases [ 443 , 475 ] . Caveolin - 1 phosphorylation may perturb caveolin oligomerization , which could in turn allow internalization [ 475 ] . Such a requirement for phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 may explain why both loss of caveolin [ 466 ] , as well as over - expression of caveolin - 1 [ 476 , 477 ] can block internalization . 47 Caveolar internalization can be stimulated by modulating glycosphingolipid content [ 455 , 464 ] and binding of albumin to gp60 [ 478 ] , or by addition of virus , such as SV40 [ 444 ] . Importantly , internalization via caveolae , like CME , requires the GTPase dynamin [ 479 - 481 ] ; dynamin becomes recruited to the neck of caveolae [ 480 ] . Interestingly , Src phosphorylation of Y231 and Y597 on dynamin - 2 results in an increase dynamin - 2 GTPase activity , and its direct interaction with caveolin - 1 at the plasma membrane , and is required for caveolae - mediated internalization [ 479 , 482 ] . A function paralell to clathrin adaptors AP - 2 and dab2 could be possible for cholesterol , namely to recruit cargo molecules that preferentially partition to a cholesterol - rich membrane microdomain of the plasma membrane . However , this cannot be the only requirement for partitioning into caveolae , as non - caveolae membrane detergent resistant , cholesterol - rich membranes exist [ 483 ] . Caveolae are also enriched in lipids other than cholesterol , primarily glycosphingolipids [ 458 ] . Thus , yet unidentified protein adaptor molecules may function in caveolar internalization . Identification of these putative adaptors would greatly aid in the understanding of caveolar internalization , possibly by revealing internalization motifs analogous to those of the adaptins in CME . Clathrin and caveolae - independent internalization In addition to the internalization of surface proteins and lipid via CME and caveolae , there are additional routes employed by certain proteins , which can be roughly sub - divided by dynamin - dependence ( see Table 5 ) . Comparatively little is known about these mechanisms of internalization , and these routes are often negatively defined , although a requirement for specific Arf and Rho family GTPases has been described in many cases . Furthermore , a very sensitive requirement for membrane cholesterol appears to be common for these CME - and caveolae - independent routes , and many of these cargo molecules partition to detergent – resistant membranes ( DRMs ) . It is important to stress that a common requirement for GTPases , dynamin , or other factors between two cargo proteins that internalize via CME - and caveolae - independent mechanisms does not per se imply that these share an endocytic route . 48 Dynamin - dependent routes . Several cargo molecules that internalize via clathrin - and caveolae - independent mechanism ( s ) require the GTPase dynamin . The interleukin - 2 receptor β ( IL - 2R β ) employs such a mechanism , and localizes to regions of the plasma membrane distinct from CCPs , which are strikingly devoid of protein coats [ 484 ] . This suggests that , in a manner similar to caveolae , membrane curvature may be achieved not by reliance on coat proteins , but instead by enrichment of particular lipids that intrinsically form membrane curvature within endocytic pits . Shiga toxin , though binding and clustering of the receptor globotriaosyl ceramide ( Gb3 ) , forms tubular and vesicular invaginations of 80 - 120 nm in diameter on the PM , which then internalize in a dynamin - dependent manner [ 485 ] . Interestingly , the toxin tubulates giant unilamellar vesicles containing Gb3 in vitro , suggesting clustering of lipids is sufficient to induce membrane curvature . Moreover , an involvement of the cytoskeleton is suggested , as internalization of γ - c receptor ( γ cR ) is sensitive to the actin disruptor latrunculin , and by a requirement for cortactin for both IL - 2R β [ 486 ] and γ cR [ 487 ] internalization . Dynamin - independent routes . This category is likely composed of several distinct routes . One of these internalizes glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) in a Cdc42 - and Arf1 - dependent manner and results in targeting of vesicles to tubulovesicluar [ 477 ] GPI - enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) . Recently , flotillin - 1 ( also known as reggie - 2 ) was proposed as an adaptor for this route , as it internalized together with GPI - APs and siRNA gene silencing of flotillin - 1 resulted in inhibition of GPI - AP internalization [ 488 ] . Although flotillins had been reported to complex with caveolins and thus localize to a subpopulation of caveolae [ 489 ] , flotillin - GPI - AP clusters and endocytic structures were distinct from both caveolae and CCPs [ 483 , 488 ] . Thus , the relationship between caveolae - and GPI - AP - cluster - localized flotillin remains to be elucidated , as does a possible relationship between caveolar - and this dynamin - independent form of internalization . This endocytic route leading to the GEEC pathway requires actin polymerization , which was proposed to occur downstream of Cdc42 [ 490 ] . In addition to the dependence on Cdc42 , a role for Arf6 for the internalization of some cargo that are likely dynamin - independent has also been demonstrated . These include major histocompatibility complex I ( MHC I ) , CD59 , carboxypetidase E , and some GPI - APs ( see Table 49 5 ) . Whether Cdc42 and Afr6 functionally demark separate routes or are distinct regulators of a common endocytic mechanism remains to be determined [ 491 ] . Another form of dynamin - independent endocytosis , macropinocytosis , which was among the first forms of uptake observed by Lewis in the 1930’s [ 384 ] , involves larger actin - based protrusions of the plasma membrane , larger than 1 μ m in diameter , that are often responsible for the bulk of fluid - phase uptake [ 492 ] . Macropinocytosis is constitutive in some cell types , but in others occurs only upon stimulation with growth factors such as EGF , HGF - SF and MCSF . Macropinocytosis is distinct from phagocytosis as it is particle - independent , and resolves by collapse and fusion onto the cell membrane or onto another protrusion , trapping fluid within large vesicles [ 388 , 492 ] . Although dextran is often used to demark macropinocytosis , it should be noted that fluid - phase endocytosis can occur independently of macropinocytosis , as via a non - coated , dynamin - dependent route [ 493 ] or GEEC - bound endocytic carriers [ 494 ] .

Proteins that internalize via clathrin - and caveolae - independent mechanisms .

The toxin can employ clathrin [ 458 , 516 ] , caveolae [ 458 , 516 , 517 ] and dynamin - independent [ 516 , 517 ] internalization mechanisms . Hence , CTxB cannot be reliably used as a marker of a particular endocytic route . Recently , the C - terminal - binding protein / brefeldin A - ADP ribosylated substrate ( CtBP / BARS ) was shown to control fission of vesicles involved in basolateral transport from the Golgi to the PM and in fluid phase endocytosis of dextran , but not TfR endocytosis [ 518 ] . This suggests that CtBP / BARS plays a role functionally analogous to dynamin . Examination of the role of CtBP / BARS in the internalization of many dynamin - independent cargoes such as GPI - APs and flotillin may better define these internalization events . Similar to what was observed for caveolae , all clathrin - independent routes of internalization are not coated with protein to the same extent as clathrin - coated pits . Interestingly , adding the cholesterol derivative poly ( ethylene glycol ) cholesteryl ester , to induce flattening and “stiffening” of the plasma membrane , inhibited caveolar - and clathrin - independent fluid - phase endocytosis far more than CME [ 519 ] . These observations are consistent with the idea that the coat recruited to the membrane during CME being able to exert relatively great force to curve the plasma membrane . In contrast , CME - independent forms of endocytosis , that recruit little or no protein coat , rely on other membrane - curving mechanisms , such as recruitment or generation of certain lipids to invaginate the PM . The role of dynamin in internalization Dynamin is a large ( 100 kDa ) protein that contains an N - terminal GTPase domain , a middle domain , and C - terminal PH , GTPase effector ( GED ) and proline - and arginine - rich ( PRD ) domains . Dynamin self - assembles into ring - like structures in vitro under low ionic - strength conditions or upon membrane templates , which stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin 100 - fold [ 393 ] . The self - assembly and template - stimulated increases in dynamin’s GTPase activity is due to the GED domain , which acts as an assembly - driven GAP . In an in vitro 52 system , dynamin caused twisting of membrane tubules that eventually lead to membrane scission [ 409 ] . Along with the finding that the shibire dynamin mutant in Drosophila melanogaster exhibits accumulation of invaginated membrane pits surrounded by dynamin collars , these observations have suggested that dynamin functions as a mechanochemical GTPase . In such a model , the energy of GTP hydrolysis is coupled to conformational changes in assembled dynamin that lead to vesicle scission from the membrane . However , an alternative model for dynamin function also been proposed , that dynamin functions as a regulatory GTPase similar to Rho and Arf proteins [ 393 ] . In this case , GTP - binding by dynamin results in a conformational change that allows binding of effector molecules , hence dynamin acts as a regulated adaptor . This model was first suggested from identification of mutants of dynamin’s GED that prevent dynamin self - assembly and thus assembly - stimulated GTPase activity , yet enhanced dynamin - dependent endocytosis [ 520 ] . Furthermore , suppressor mutations of shibire that allow dynamin self - assembly , but not assembly - stimulated GTP hydrolysis , could rescue endocytosis [ 408 ] . This demonstrates that GTP loading but not GTP hydrolysis is sufficient for CME , thereby supporting the role of dynamin as a regulatory GTPase . Examination of the kinetic properties of dynamin with respect to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis , and conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding in the switch I & II regions of dynamin’s GTPase domain have revealed that it cannot be characterized solely as either a mechanochemical motor or regulatory GTPase [ 393 ] . As such , dynamin likely has both mechanochemical and regulatory GTPase functions . Consistent with multiple functions of this protein , many different clathrin coat components can recruit dynamin to CCPs ( see Table 4 ) . An interesting consideration for dynamin - dependent forms of clathrin - independent internalization is which of these functions , or possibly both , are required for internalization . That caveolin - 1 can directly recruit dynamin in a manner that requires phosphorylation on Y231 ( GTPase domain ) and Y597 ( PH domain ) of dynamin [ 479 , 482 ] , suggests that dynamin recruitment to caveolae , and perhaps its function therein , may be different than in CME , where dynamin is thought to be recruited via its SH3 domain [ 393 ] . Although dynamin is also recruited to the neck of caveolae [ 480 ] , this different mechanism of recruitment , particularly its dynamin phosphorylation - dependence is consistent with a multifunctional GTPase that may perform different roles in 53 clathrin - and caveolae - dependent endocytosis . Of note , mutants of dynamin that are deficient in both GTP binding and hydrolysis , or siRNA gene silencing of dynamin cannot distinguish between these functions . Thus , as is the case for CME , the molecular role of dynamin itself should be assessed individually for each clathrin - independent , dynamin - dependent route . 1 . 9 Rationale Insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus are critical clinical problems worldwide . This has prompted extensive study of the mechanism of insulin action elevating surface GLUT4 and glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipocytes . As a result , a model has emerged whereby insulin stimulation leads to exocytosis of GLUT4 - containing vesicles through regulation at multiple distinct stages . However , the contribution of GLUT4 to glucose uptake is dependent on more than its rate of exocytosis , and can potentially be affected by the intrinsic activity of cell surface transporters ( how fast GLUT4 works ) and the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis ( how long it stays at the cell surface ) . As some studies have suggested that insulin regulates the intrinsic activity of the transporter , it is important to understand the signaling mechanisms linking the insulin receptor to modulation of glucose transport turnover at the plasma membrane , as well as to gain insight into the molecular basis of this regulation , of which not much is currently known . In addition , modulation of the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis could also contribute to regulation of cell surface GLUT4 . However , only a few studies have examined the mechanism of GLUT4 endocytosis in adipocytes and no information exists regarding this process in skeletal muscle , yet glucose disposal occurs mostly into the latter in vivo . Moreover , it is not known how muscle contraction impinges on GLUT4 traffic . It is possible that regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis can , at least in part , account for the increase in cell surface GLUT4 elicited by contraction . The plasma membrane may thus represent an important locus of regulation of GLUT4 function , either by modulation of intrinsic activity or of endocytosis , yet little information 54 currently exists about these phenomena in muscle . Understanding GLUT4 exocytosis , endocytosis and intrinsic activity will allow for targeted approaches to increase glucose uptake and relieve insulin resistance . 1 . 10 General Hypothesis It is possible that insulin , muscle contraction , and perhaps other stimuli , in addition to several other known signals , also trigger signaling pathways that act at the plasma membrane to modulate one of or both the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 and the rate of endocytosis of GLUT4 . 55 Chapter 2 2 The activation and role of p38MAPK upon insulin stimulation Part of the work described in this Chapter was previously published within ( as indicated ) : Antonescu , CN , Huang C , Niu W , Liu Z , Eyers PA , Heidenreich KA , Bilan PJ and Klip A .

It is widely accepted that GLUT4 translocation is required for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake , but it has been debated whether translocation is the sole mechanism responsible for this phenomenon [ 525 , 526 ] , also see Section 7 ( Appendix ) . The possibility of insulin regulation of glucose uptake independent of the amount of cell surface glucose transporters , perhaps through regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity , has been suggested based on observations that insulin stimulation of glucose uptake rate in many instances exceeds that of translocation [ 525 - 527 ] . In addition , several studies have demonstrated that insulin - stimulated glucose uptake can be segregated from GLUT4 translocation based on differential sensitivities to insulin concentrations [ 528 ] and inhibition by the PI3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin [ 529 , 530 ] . Notably , inhibitors of p38 mitogen - activated protein kinases ( p38MAPK ) such as pyridinyl imidazole derivatives ( SB203580 and SB202190 ) or azaazulene pharmacophores ( A291077 and A304000 ) inhibit insulin - mediated glucose uptake [ 167 , 168 , 531 - 535 ] with no effect on GLUT4 translocation in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 168 , 536 ] , L6 myotubes [ 528 , 533 ] , mouse brown adipocytes [ 532 ] , and rat skeletal muscles [ 531 ] . These observations suggest that , upon insulin stimulation , activated p38MAPK may participate in the increase in the rate of glucose uptake , independently of the amount of cell surface GLUT4 , possibly by increasing GLUT4 intrinsic activity . p38MAPK activation p38MAPKs are serine / threonine kinases activated by environmental stressors [ 116 , 127 ] , inflammatory cytokines [ 537 ] , protein synthesis inhibitors [ 91 , 538 ] , as well as growth factors such as insulin and Platelet - Derived Growth Factor ( PDGF ) [ 168 , 539 ] and muscle contraction [ 531 , 540 ] . All of these conditions in some form stimulate glucose uptake into muscle . Four isoforms of p38MAPK have been identified : p38 α [ 116 ] and p38 β  [ 118 ] are ubiquitously 57 expressed , while p38 γ is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and p38 δ in the lung and kidney [ 121 ] . The function of p38MAPKs in regulation of transcription has been extensively studied ( see Section 1 . 4 ) . The muscle - specific p38 γ negatively regulates GLUT4 expression in L6 myotubes at the level of transcription [ 541 ] . Full activation of p38MAPK requires dual phosphorylation on residues corresponding to threonine - 180 and tyrosine - 182 on p38 α catalyzed by dual specificity MAPK - kinases 3 and 6 ( MKK3 and 6 ) . In addition , p38MAPK α can be activated by intramolecular auto - phosphorylation , independently of MKKs , through a mechanism that depends on the association of p38 α with the adaptor molecule TGF - β activated kinase - binding protein - 1 ( TAB1 ) [ 542 ] . Importantly , p38MAPK auto - phosphorylation via TAB1 , but not phosphorylation by MKK3 / 6 , is sensitive to the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 ( Figure 5 ) . TAB1 , a 503 amino acid protein , is known to bind TAK1 , a MAPKKK , by its C - terminal 83 amino acids , resulting in activation of TAK1 [ 543 ] , which in turn can classically activate p38MAPK in an MKK3 / 6 – dependent manner , such as following TGF - β stimulation in mouse heart [ 544 ] or following hyperosmolar stress in HEK293 cells [ 542 ] . However , a TAB1 mutant deficient in this C - terminal region retains p38 autophosphorylation activity , which occurs by p38MAPK binding to a region within amino acids 313 - 418 of TAB1 [ 542 ] . Moreover , a splicing isoform of TAB1 , TAB1 β , which lacks the TAK1 - binding C - terminal region and cannot activate TAK1 [ 545 ] , can bind to and cause autophosphorylation of p38MAPK α . Thus , TAB1 - dependent p38MAPK autophosphorylation is independent of classical MAPK activation of p38MAPK . TAB1 - dependent p38MAPK autophosphorylation occurs in the ischemic heart , in an AMPK - dependent manner [ 546 ] and a MKK3 - independent manner [ 544 ] . Interestingly , bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - stimulated phosphorylation of p38MAPK occurred in by autophosphorylation in HEK293 cells expressing Toll - like Receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , but not TLR2 [ 542 ] . Hence , it appears that p38MAPK can be specifically activated by distinct mechanisms depending on the stimulus and this raising the important possibility that the mechanism of activation of p38MAPK may select for specific downstream targets of p38MAPK . In support of the above interpretation , Lu et al . [ 158 ] have found that p38MAPK bound to and activated by TAB1 is prevented from entering the nucleus , and thereby prevented from interacting with pro - 58 inflammatory transcription factor substrates . Interestingly , in cardiomyocytes , TAB1 expression can antagonize interleukin - 1 β - induced inflammatory gene expression as a result of cytosolic retention of p38MAPK [ 158 ] . Therefore , it may be possible to generalize that p38MAPK activated by a TAB1 - depedent auto - phosphorylation mechanism results in a cytosolic , anti - inflammatory role for p38MAPK , whereas MKK3 / 6 - phosphorylated p38MAPK results in nuclear localization and pro - inflammatory role of p38MAPK [ 158 ] . The mechanism by which insulin stimulates p38MAPK phosphorylation has not been explored . Thus , determining the mechanism of p38MAPK activation , whether by auto - phosphorylation or MKK3 / 6 - dependent phosphorylation , is critical for understanding the role of p38MAPK in insulin action in skeletal muscle . Figure 5 . MKK3 / 6 and TAB1 mediate p38MAPK phosphorylation by distinct mechanisms . “Classical”p38MAPK phosphorylation occurs as a result of MAPKKK ( mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase kinase ) phosphorylation of MKK3 and / or MKK6 , which in turn phosphorylate p38MAPK on T180 and Y182 . SB203580 inhibits p38MAPK activity , but not p38MAPK phosphorylation by this mechanism . Alternatively , p38MAPK autophosphorylation depends on binding to TAB1 . SB203580 inhibits both p38MAPK activity and p38MAPK phosphorylation by this mechanism 59 Maximal stimulation of p38MAPK in L6 myotubes occurs at 100 nM insulin , but still occurs at lower ( 10 nM ) insulin concentration [ 547 ] . Glucose uptake stimulated by sub - maximal insulin stimulation ( 10 nM ) was similarly sensitive to SB203580 as maximal stimulation ( 100 nM ) in L6 myotubes , without any effect on the amount of cell surface GLUT4 myc ( Figure 6 ) . In addition , p38MAPK inhibitors can reduce the glucose uptake simulated by berberine [ 548 ] , torpamine [ 549 ] , TNF α [ 550 ] , and α - lipoic acid [ 166 ] in L6 myotubes , by adrenaline [ 551 ] and thrombin [ 552 ] in vascular smooth muscle cells , by an extract of grape seed procyanidins in L6E9 myotubes and 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 553 ] , by AICAR and dinitrophenol in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 554 ] , and by nitroprusside [ 555 ] and dinitrophenol [ 556 ] in isolated rat cardiomyocytes . These studies suggest a common mode of action for several distinct stimuli which lead to an increase in glucose uptake , that of the activation of p38MAPK . Figure 6 . SB203580 inhibits sub - maximal ( 10 nM ) as well as maximal ( 100 nM ) insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes without affecting cell surface GLUT4 myc . L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes were incubated with vehicle ( open bars ) or 10 μ M SB203580 ( closed bars ) for 40 min , in the absence or presence of insulin during the last 20 min of the incubation . Shown are graphs depicting mean 2 - deoxyglucose uptake ( A ) and cell surface GLUT4 myc ( B ) measurements ± SE of 3 independent experiments . Each condition was assayed in triplicate . In all , values were normalized to the vehicle - treated basal condition . * , p < 0 . 05 . Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2005 ) 146 : 3773 - 81 Collectively , these results have raised the hypothesis that insulin and other stimuli increase the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 via activation of p38MAPK . Although they have been shown to be highly potent inhibitors of p38 α and β  [ 347 , 557 ] , recent studies have revealed some 60 previously unknown targets of pyridinyl imidazole derivatives such as SB203580 [ 558 ] . These findings highlight the importance of validating observations made with chemical inhibitors with additional , more specific molecular techniques . Moreover , a role for p38MAPK in the putative acute regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity should be expected to occur through cytosolic phospho - p38MAPK , and hence TAB1 - dependent p38MAPK autophosphorylation . Thus , the purpose of the work described in this chapter is to define the mechanism of activation of p38MAPK by insulin and to explore , by expression of mutants of p38MAPK and siRNA gene silencing , the possible role of p38MAPK α and / or β in insulin stimulation of glucose uptake independently of the amount of cell surface GLUT4 . 2 . 2 Methods Materials Alpha Modified Eagle’s Medium with Earle’s salts and ribonucleosides , L - glutamine and deoxyribonucleosides ( α - MEM ) and trypsin solution ( 0 . 5 % trypsin with 0 . 53 mM ethylenediamine tetra - acetic acid ) were obtained from Wisent ( St - Bruno , Quebec ) .

Cell culture and construction of stable cell lines GLUT4 myc cDNA was constructed by inserting the human c - myc epitope into the first ectodomain of rat GLUT4 and subcloned into the pCXN2 vector [ 560 ] , stably transfected into L6 myoblasts ( termed L6 - GLUT4 myc cells ) , and characterized [ 26 , 279 , 561 - 564 ] . L6 cells not stably transfected are termed L6 - WT cells . All L6 myoblasts were grown as previously described [ 26 , 279 , 561 - 564 ] . L6 - GLUT4 myc cells were thawed into 75 cm 2 tissue culture flasks in α - MEM supplemented with 62 growth medium ( α - MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and antibiotics ) , under sterile conditions . Cells are grown by incubation at 37 C , under constant 5 % CO 2 . On passage ( typically when cells reach 50 - 60 % confluence ) , cells were discarded of growth medium and quickly washed with sterile PBS , which is also discarded . Cells were incubated with the solution of trypsin for about 30s – 1 min ( until the cells begin to round up ) at 37 C . Cells were resuspended in 10 mL of growth medium , and 1 mL is diluted for passage into 12 or 25 mL of fresh growth medium and grown in 75 or 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks , respectively . To seed L6 myoblasts for an experiment , upon passage cell density was obtained using a hemocytometer , and cells were diluted in growth medium to a density of 2 to 4 x 10 4 cells / mL . Subsequently , 0 . 5 , 1 or 2 mL of this cell suspension was seeded into each well of 24 - , 12 - or 6 - well plates , respectively . Experiments were typically performed 48 h after seeding . To seed L6 myotubes for an experiment , the same procedure was used as for L6 myoblasts , but with differentiation medium ( α - MEM supplemented with 2 % FBS and antibiotics ) instead of growth medium . Fresh differentiation media was added to cells every 48h , and experiments were performed 7 days after seeding , after ensuring complete differentiation by morphological examination . Both L6 myoblasts and L6 myotubes were serum deprived in α - MEM supplemented with antibiotics solution ( devoid of FBS ) for 3 - 5 h prior to all experiments . To construct cDNA vectors for selective expression of DN - p38MAPK α and β dominant - negative mutants in differentiated myotubes , the mouse muscle creatine kinase [ 305 ] promoter was used to drive expression of these cDNAs in L6 cells . The MCK promoter was excised from MCK - pEtCAT by EcoRI digest and subcloned into EcoRI sites of pBluescript - EP ( pBluescript containing β - globin poly - adenosine sequence subcloned into EcoR1 / PstI site , pBS - EP ) . FLAG - DN - p38MAPK α and p38MAPK β were excised from their respective vectors , pOPI 3 and pCDNA3 ) by NotI and combined HindIII and XbaI digestion , respectively , and subcloned into the BstEII site on pBS - MCK - EP following 3’ - overhang filling in of all digested ends . The resulting constructs were sequence verified and named MCK - FLAG - DN - p38MAPK α or β , accordingly . To create L6 myoblasts stably transfected with MCK - FLAG - DN - p38MAPK α and β , cells were co - transfected with a 5 : 1 molar ratio of plasmid encoding a blasticidin resistance gene 63 ( pBSR ) to MCK - FLAG - DN - p38MAPK plasmid using Effectine transfection reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) , as per manufacturer’s instructions . 24 hours following transfection , cells were placed in growth medium supplemented with 2 . 5 μ g / mL blasticidin . Cells were maintained normally , by passaging when appropriate , until blasticidin selection was complete , typically 48 - 72 h . Complete blasticidin selection was assessed by monitoring the complete killing of a separate flask of untransfected L6 - WT myoblasts . To select for single transfected clones , L6 cells were seeded at very low density ( 50 - 100 cells per 10 cm dish ) and grown for 3 - 5 days until individual cell colonies could be observed by the naked eye . Each colony represented the expansion of a single , genetically identical , stably transfected L6 clone . Clones were isolated by use of cloning cylinders : each cylinder was selectively treated with 200 μ L of trypsin for 3 min and the contents of each cylinder were transferred to a well of a 24 - well plate , and supplemented with growth medium . Individual stably transfected L6 myoblast clonal colonies were expanded , and scored for protein expression ( Figure 10 ) and ability to differentiate into myotubes ( Figure 12 ) . Typically , ~ 30 % of cells expressed DN - FLAG - p38MAPK α or β protein . Total and mitochondrial membrane purification L6 myotubes were grown on 25 cm 2 dishes . Following serum deprivation , L6 cells were washed twice in ice - cold PBS supplemented with 1 mM NaVO 4 , and then cells were scraped in homogenization buffer ( 20 mM NaHCO 3 , 250 mM sucrose , 5 mM NaN s , supplemented with PIC , 1 mM NaVO 4 and 100 nM okadaic acid ) and homogenized using a Wheaton glass homogenizer 25 times , on ice . Samples were centrifuged at 1 , 300g for 10 min ( Beckman JA - 20 . 1 , 3500 rpm ) to pellet cell debris , and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 9000g for 10 min to pellet mitochondrial membrane fraction ( MM ) . Subsequently , the supernatant was centrifuged at 229 , 000g ( Beckman 70 . 1 Ti 50 , 000rpm ) for 90 min to precipitate total membranes ( TM ) . Purified TM and MM pellets were resuspended in 500 mL homogenization buffer and passed 25 times through a 28 gauge syringe . 64 Lysates and immunoblotting Cell lysates and immunoblots were performed as a modification [ 528 , 533 , 562 , 564 ] of the method first described by Laemmli [ 565 ] . Cell lysates were prepared by first washing cells twice with cold PBS containing 1 mM NaVO 4 , and then lysed by adding 300uL of 2X Laemmli sample buffer ( 2X LSB : 0 . 125 M Tris pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS ( w / v ) , 5 % glycerol ( w / v ) and 7 . 5 % β - mercaptoethanol ( w / v ) , supplemented with PIC , 1 mM NaVO 4 , and 100 nM okadaic acid ) directly to cells grown on 6 - well dishes . Lysed cells were scraped and transferred to a microfuge tube , passed through a 28 - guage syringe 5 times and then heated to 65 C for 20 min . Note that for experiments to detect GLUT4 , lysates were heated to 50 C for 30 min instead to prevent irreversible aggregation of GLUT4 . Polyacrylamide gels ( 1 . 5 mm thick ) were prepared as follows using the Protean II SDS - PAGE system from BioRad ( Hercules , CA ) : a separating gel solution ( 0 . 375 M Tris pH 8 . 8 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 10 % acrylamide , 0 . 05 % TEMED ( v / v ) and 0 . 05 % ammonium persulfate ( w / v ) ) was prepared and poured into assembled gel apparatus . Following polymerization , a stacking gel solution ( 0 . 125 M Tris pH 6 . 8 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 10 % acrylamide , 0 . 05 % TEMED ( v / v ) and 0 . 05 % ammonium persulfate ( w / v ) ) was prepared and poured onto the separating gel , and appropriate combs were used to create either 10 , 12 or 15 wells . Whole cell lysate or total membrane samples equal in total protein amount were loaded into polymerized gel wells submersed in gel running buffer ( 0 . 025M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 013 M glycine ) and subjected to electrophoresis under constant voltage ( 60 V for the first 30 min , then 100 V until adequate protein resolution was achieved ) . Following appropriate protein resolution , protein samples were transferred from polyacrylamide gels onto polyvinyldiene fluoride ( PVDF , BioRad , Hercules , CA ) membranes by electrophoresis in gel transfer buffer ( 0 . 025M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 013 M glycine , 20 % methanol ) under constant voltage at 100 V at 4 C . Subsequently , membranes were washed twice quickly in wash buffer ( 0 . 05M Tris pH 7 . 5 0 . 150 M NaCl , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 and 0 . 5 % NP40 ) , and then incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer ( wash buffer supplemented with either 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA , BioShop , Burlington , ON ) ( w / v ) or 5 % milk ( Carnation instant skim milk powder , Nestle , Vevey , Switzerland ) ( w / v ) ) , under constant shaking . Following two rapid incubations in wash buffer to remove blocking solution , membranes were incubated in primary 65 antibody solution ( wash buffer supplemented with 1 % BSA ( w / v ) , 0 . 2 % NaN 4 ( w / v ) and appropriate antibody diluted as per company specifications ) for 1 h at RT or overnight at 4C under constant shaking . Excess primary antibodies were removed by six 10 min washes at RT in wash buffer under constant shaking , and membranes were then incubated in secondary antibody solution ( wash buffer supplemented with 1 % BSA ( w / v ) and 1 : 750 dilution of horseradish peroxidase - conjugated either donkey - anti - mouse or goat - anti - rabbit antibodies ) for 1 h at RT under constant shaking . Following extensive washing of membranes to remove excess antibodies , bound horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by incubation of membranes wish Western Lightning Enhanced Luminol Reagent from PerkinElmer ( Boston , MA ) for 3 min and subsequent exposure of HyBlot CL autoradiographic film ( Denville Scientific , Metuchen , NJ ) to membranes in the absence of light for varying amounts of time , followed by development of film . Detected protein bands were digitalized by scanning of films and quantified using Image J software ( National Institutes of Health , NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . To re - probe with additional antibodies , membranes were re - wet in methanol , and then incubated with membrane striping buffer ( 65 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 2 % SDS ( w / v ) and 0 . 2 % β - mercaptoethanol ) for 30 min at 50 C . Subsequently , blots were washed 4 times in blot wash buffer and then incubated with blocking and antibody solutions as described above . 2 - Deoxyglucose and 3 - O - methylglucose uptake 2 - Deoxyglucose uptake was measured as previously described [ 528 , 533 , 562 , 564 , 566 ] . Following appropriate stimulation , L6 myocytes grown in 24 - well plates were washed twice in Klip’s buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 140 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM MgSO 4 , 1 . 0 mM CaCl 2 ) and then incubated with 250 μ L transport solution ( Klip’s buffer containing either 10 μ M D - 2 - deoxy - glucose with 0 . 5 μ Ci / ml 2 - deoxy - D - [ 3 H ] - glucose or 50 μ M 3 - O - methylglucose with 4 µCi / mL 3 - O - [ 3 H ] methylglucose ) for 5 min ( 2 - deoxyglucose ) or 30 s ( 3 - O - methylglucose ) at room temperature . Non - specific radiolabel uptake was determined by separate incubation with transport solution supplemented with 10 μ M cytochalasin B . To terminate the reaction , 1 mL of 4 C stop solution ( 0 . 9 % saline ( w / v ) containing 20 mM α - D - glucose ) was added , and cells were 66 rapidly washed twice more in stop solution . Cells were lysed by - 20 C incubation overnight followed by scraping in 500 μ L 0 . 05 N NaOH . Following addition of Ready Safe scintillation fluid from Beckman Coulter ( Fullerton , CA ) , β - particle emission corresponding to 2 - deoxy - D - [ 3 H ] - glucose or 3 - O - [ 3 H ] methylglucose within each sample was counted using 1209 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter ( LKB Wallac , Turku , Finland ) . 2 - deoxyglucose or 3 - O - methylglucose uptake was normalized to total protein by parallel determination of protein concentration in 0 . 05 N NaOH lystes using BioRad reagent ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . GLUT4 myc translocation by cell population - based assay GLUT4 myc translocation was assayed by a colorimetric method as previously described [ 168 , 562 , 567 ] . Following appropriate stimulation , serum - starved L6 myocytes grown in 24 - well plates were washed three times in ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , 154 mM NaCl , 5 . 6 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 1 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) supplemented with 1 mM Ca 2 + and 1 mM Mg 2 + ( PBS + ) , and blocked in ice - cold 5 % goat serum ( GS ) in PBS + for 15 min . Subsequently , surface GLUT4 myc in intact , non - permeabilized L6 cells was labeled by anti - myc antibody solution ( 1 . 0 μ g / mL in PBS + with 5 % GS ) . The cells were then washed extensively in ice - cold PBS + to remove excess antibodies , and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS + for 10 min followed by quenching of fixative by 100 mM glycine in PBS + for 10 minutes , all at 4C . GLUT4 - bound anti - myc antibodies at the cell surface were detected with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection of bound HRP by o - phenylenediamide ( OPD ) assay as per manufacturer’s instructions . Following appropriate time to allow development of chromogenic product ( 2 , 3 - diaminophenazine ) , the reactions were terminated by addition of 0 . 01 M HCl , and 250 μ L of resulting solution for each sample was transferred to a 96 - well plate . Absorbance of each sample at 492 nm was determined using a microplate reader . . 67 Adenovirus - mediated gene delivery in L6 myotubes Construction of DR - p38MAPK adenovirus cDNA constructs . Adenovirus particles containing cDNAs encoding DR - p38 α were constructed using the AdEasy I system [ 568 ] from Stratagene ( La Jolla , CA ) . Briefly , cDNA encoding DR - p38 α was subcloned into adenovirus shuttle vector ( pAdTrack - CMV ) and subsequently inserted into a plasmid ( pAdEasy - 1 ) encoding modified adenoviral genome by homologous recombination in E . coli strain BJ5183 . Subsequently , recombined pAdEasy - 1 was transfected into HEK293AD cells . All other viruses were constructed previously [ 568 ] . Isolation of adenovirus particles and infection of L6 myotubes . Virus particles were generated and purified as previously described [ 568 ] . HEK293AD cells were grown to confluence in 150 mm dishes , infected with 20 mL of virus solution ( 1x10 10 virus particles suspended in DMEM supplemented with 2 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ) , and grown at 37 C for 30 h . At this point , HEK293AD cells become cytopathic and appear round and refractile . Cells were then scraped into autoclaved centrifuge bottles and centrifuged at 4000 rpm to pellet infected HEK293AD cells . Following removal of the supernatant to bleach , the pellet was resuspended in 0 . 5 mL ( per plate harvested ) of 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 1 , and samples were freeze - thawed ( alcohol - dry ice to 37 C ) three times to lyse HEK293AD cells and release virus . Lysates were centrifuged 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4 C , and the pellet discarded . Adenovirus particles were further purified by discontinuous cesium chloride gradient . 10 mL of each of light and heavy cesium chloride solutions ( 22 . 39 g CsCl in 77 . 61 mL of 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 and 42 . 23 g CsCl in 57 . 77 mL of 10 mM Tris , pH 80 , respectively ) were layered in an ultracentrifuge tube for a Beckman SW28 rotor . The viral supernatant was added to the top of the cesium gradient , and the centrifuged for 2 h at 20 , 000 rpm at 4 C . A narrow white opaque band , corresponding to virus particles , was removed from 2 / 3 down the heavy / light cesium gradient , and diluted into an equal volume of 10 mM Tris buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) . Onto another discontinuous cesium gradient ( 4 mL each of heavy and light CsCl solution ) was layered diluted viral band and centrifuged overnight at 20 , 000 rpm at 4 C ( Beckman SW40 rotor ) . The viral 68 band was again removed and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 with 1 mM MgCl 2 and stored as a 10 % glycerol solution at - 80 C . The infectivity of adenovirus particles was determined using tissue culture infectious dose 50 ( TCID50 ) criteria , and then converted to plaque forming units according to AdEasy I system manual . Alternatively , viral particle count was also determined by OD260 reading , where OD260 x dilution x 10 12 = particles / mL . Differentiating L6 myotubes were incubated with 2 . 5x10 5 PFU / well ( 24 - well plate ) adenovirus particles in antibiotic / antimycotic - free α - MEM and 5 mM glucose for 4 h ( in serum - free medium ) . Infection proceeded for 10 - 12 h ( WT - p38 α and DR - p38 α adenovirus ) or 18 - 24 h ( DN - p38 α , DN - p38 β and GFP adenovirus ) prior to serum deprivation and experimentation . siRNA transfection Cells were incubated in antibiotic - free α - MEM and 5 mM glucose , supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum for 72 h , then transfected with 500 nM siRNA of non - relevant ( NR ) sequence , or siRNA specific for p38 α , p38 β or p38 α and β together , using Oligofectamine transfection reagent ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad CA ) , 48h and again 24 h prior to experimentation . Transfection involved incubation of L6 cells for 4 h in serum - free antibiotic / antimycotic - free α - MEM containing 5 mM glucose for 4 h and the siRNA - Oligofectamine mixture . Subsequently , fetal bovine serum was added to each well to a final concentration of 2 % and the cells were incubated until the next transfection or experiment . Immunoprecipitation of Phospho - P38MAPK Following serum starvation and stimulation as required , L6 myotubes were washed twice in ice - cold PBS ( supplemented with 1 mM NaVO 4 ) , and then lysed in p38MAPK lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol ( v / v ) , 1 % TX - 100 ( v / v ) , 30 mM Sodium pyrophosphate , 10 mM NaF , 1 mM EDTA , supplemented with PIC , 100 nM Okadaic acid and 69 NaVO 4 ) . Cell samples were passed 5 X through a 25 - guage syringe , and centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm ( Mikro - 20 ) at 4 C . Following determination of protein concentration in each samples by BCA assay , the equal protein amount per sample were incubated with sepharose beads conjugated to anti - phospho - p38MAPK antibodies overnight at 4 C under constant rotation . To wash beads , 5 min centrifugation at 12 , 000 rpm ( Mikro - 20 ) at 4 C was performed , followed by removal of supernatant and addition of 500 μ L of fresh lysis buffer buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol ( v / v ) , 1 % TX - 100 ( v / v ) , and 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin , supplemented with PIC , 100 nM Okadaic acid and NaVO 4 ) . Washing was repeated to a total of 4 washed , all on ice . Following aspiration of last wash , 2 X LSB was added , and samples were subject to SDS - PAGE . Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA photolabelling of GLUT4 myc The method of the Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA photolabel was adapted as follows : following experimental treatments , L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes were washed in 18 C 10mM HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , containing 140 mM NaCl , 4 . 7 mM KCl , 1 . 25 mM MgSO 4 , 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , and 2 . 5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , then exposed to 0 . 2 mM Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA and irradiated for 1 min in a Rayonet photochemical reactor under 350 nm light . Following washing in ice - cold HEPES buffer , cells were lysed in PBS containing 2 % Thesit ( C 12 E 9 ) and centrifuged at 20 , 000g for 20 min at 4 degrees . Supernatants were incubated with immobilized streptavidin on 6 % beaded agarose for 20 h at 4 degrees . Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 12 , 000g for 5 min , washed twice in PBS containing 1 % ( w / v ) Thesit and twice in PBS containing 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) Thesit . Precipitated proteins were solubilized in LSB containing 8M urea and 1 mM EDTA , heated at 98 C for 30 min , resolved by SDS - PAGE , and GLUT4 myc was detected by immunoblotting with anti - myc antibodies . 70 2 . 3 Evidence for insulin - stimulated GLUT4 activation As discussed in Sections 2 . 1 and 7 , numerous observations have been made in which the amount of cell surface GLUT4 can be dissociated from the rate of glucose uptake , which suggest that certain stimuli , such as insulin , can regulate the intrinsic activity of the transporter . Specifically , in L6 myotubes , the increase in 2 - deoxyglucose uptake is significantly greater than the increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc [ 528 ] , under conditions where GLUT4 is responsible for the entirely of glucose transport seen by sensitivity to the drug indinavir [ 521 ] . However , care must be taken with these observations , as differences in 2 - deoxyglucose uptake can result from regulation of post - transport events in glucose metabolism . Once transported into the cell , 2 - deoxyglucose becomes rapidly phosphorylated by hexokinase II and the resulting 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate is not a substrate of any known glucose transporter , thus becoming trapped inside the cell . However , an inhibition of hexokinase II could result in an inhibition of the apparent rate of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake . This is particularly important as 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate allosterically inhibits hexokinase II , and thus prolonged transport of 2 - deoxyglucose could result in accumulation of non - phosphorylated 2 - deoxyglucose within L6 myotubes . Such a phenomenon could result in a lower apparent rate of glucose transport being observed , as 2 - deoxyglucose uptake equilibrates across the plasma membrane . Thus , it is important to assay the linearity of 2 - deoxyglucose transport relative to time of transport when examining regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity . As can be seen in Figure 7 , the observed rate of 3 - O - methylglucose uptake decreases markedly after 30s due to lack of phosphorylation by hexokinase II , and equilibration with extracellular 3 - O - methyglucose . However , 2 - deoxyglucose uptake remains mostly linear for up to 20 min , indicating if any 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate accumulates within L6 myotubes during this time , it is insufficient to significantly inhibit hexokinase II . Moreover , whether or not the assay was stopped with 20 mM glucose ( to prevent efflux of free 2 - dexoyglucose ) did not result in a difference in the observed uptake of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake , indicating that no free 2 - deoxyglucose had accumulated inside the cell during the 20 min of this assay . These observations indicate that the 2 - deoxyglucose uptake assay allows for measurement of glucose transport without being influenced by accumulation of 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate in 71 L6 myotubes . Furthermore , increases in 2 - deoxyglucose uptake rate can be directly compared to those of cell surface GLUT4 to determine if regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity occurs following stimulation . Figure 7 . 2 - deoxyglucose , but not 3 - O - methylglucose uptake , is linear for 20 min . Following serum starvation , glucose analogue uptake was measured for various times , as indicated , followed by termination of transport reaction with cold saline supplemented with 20 mM glucose ( 3 - O - methylglucose uptake ) or either cold saline alone or cold saline supplemented with 20 mM glucose ( 2 - deogyglucose uptake ) , as indicated . Shown are the means ± SE from 5 independent experiments . The decrease in insulin - stimulated glucose uptake seen by pretreatment with SB203580 occurs by reducing glucose uptake without affecting the K M of 3 - O - Methylgucose uptake , which reflects glucose influx [ 569 ] . Thus , SB203580 is not a competitive inhibitor of glucose influx through GLUT4 , and therefore acts to inhibit glucose uptake at a stage following initial binding of glucose to the exofacial glucose - binding site on GLUT4 . In order to better understand the nature of the inhibition of SB203580 on glucose uptake , the labelling efficiency of GLUT4 with Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA was examined . Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA contains a sugar - like moiety recognized by GLUTs and a reactive group that undergoes covalent insertion into neighboring 72 atoms of the transporter upon photoactivation [ 570 ] . Thus , it is expected that the amount of photolabeled GLUT4 is an indication of the accessibility of the extracellular glucose binding site and nearby residues of GLUT4 . In agreement with previous results in adipose cells [ 209 , 570 , 571 ] , insulin caused an increase in the amount of Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA photolabeled GLUT4 myc in L6 myotubes ( Figure 8 ) , likely indicative , in part , of an increase in the amount of transporters on the cell surface . Pre - treatment of cells with SB203580 , followed by wash - out of the drug prior to Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA incubation significantly reduced the amount of photolabeled transporter in the insulin - stimulated condition but was without effect in the basal state ( Figure 8 ) . Since availability of the exofacial myc - epitope to the extracellular medium was not affected by SB203580 ( Figure 6 ) , these results suggest that while the transporter is present at the cell surface , it is the extracellular availability of residues at or surrounding the glucose binding site that is reduced by the drug [ 572 ] . As the K M observed when measuring glucose influx is not affected by SB203580 [ 569 ] , reduction of Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA photolabeling in drug - treated , insulin - stimulated conditions likely results from conformational change induced by insulin stimulation that shields residues proximal to the exofacial sugar binding site to photolabeling . 73 Figure 8 . SB203580 reduces insulin - stimulated but not basal GLUT4 photolabeling without affecting cell surface GLUT4 . Following serum starvation , L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes were pre - treated with 10 μ M SB203580 or vehicle ( DMSO ) for 20 min , and then stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 20 min , in the continued presence of the inhibitor . Photolabeled cell surface GLUT4 was isolated and subject to immunoblotting with anti - myc antibodies . Shown is a representative immunoblot , and a graph depicting mean anti - myc intensity ± SE from 5 independent experiments . * , p < 0 . 05 . This experiment performed by Wenyan Niu .

Importantly , p38MAPK is required for differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes [ 131 , 573 , 574 ] , therefore strategies to interfere with p38MAPK activity must do so only in differentiated myotubes and not in undifferentiated myoblasts . It is not surprising that that mouse models of genetic p38MAPK knockout are embryonic lethal , given the central importance of this protein on many 74 developmental processes , although strategies exist to study limited types of cells from these animals [ 124 , 575 ] . Thus , although whole - animal studies may provide an interesting strategy for the study of p38MAPK function , possible confounding effects of lethality or less severe developmental pathologies of p38MAPK deficiency must be considered when attempting to study p38MAPK function in a mature , adult muscle . L6 cells in culture offer many advantages to study p38MAPK function . Use of molecular methods of interfering with p38MAPK are efficient in cells in culture whereas technically tedious in animal models . In addition , the contribution of p38MAPK to whole - body development is not an issue in muscle cells in culture as it would be in primary muscle . p38MAPKs require phosphorylation on residues T180 and Y182 for activation and mutants of p38MAPK α and β at these residues ( T180A , Y182F ; DN - p38MAPK ) act in a dominant - negative fashion when overexpressed [ 559 ] . Thus , transfection of cDNAs encoding DN - p38MAPK mutants represents an attractive strategy to specifically interfere with p38MAPK activity . In addition , a mutant of p38MAPK α ( T180M , H107P , L108F ) that is insensitive to the inhibitor SB203580 has been described [ 558 ] and can be used to distinguish effects of SB203580 that result from an action of the drug on p38MAPK itself from that on other targets . However , no known method of transient transfection of cDNAs is able to achieve more than approximately 10 - 20 % transfection efficiency in L6 myotubes , which is not compatible with subsequent measurements by cell population - based assays such as 2 - deoxyglucose uptake . Thus , strategies to interfere with p38MAPK by expression of mutant cDNAs must rely either on selection of stably transfected L6 cell colonies that selectively express p38MAPK constructs only upon differentiation as p38MAPK is critical for muscle differentiation [ 576 ] , or on highly efficient cDNA delivery methods such as use of adenovirus . In addition , siRNA gene silencing of p38MAPK expression represents an additional strategy for interfering with p38MAPK expression and function . Stable L6 cell lines expressing DN - p38MAPK . In order to express p38MAPK only in differentiated myotubes , cDNA constructs were created in which p38MAPK α or p38MAPK β were placed under the control of the mouse creatine kinase [ 305 ] promoter ( Figure 9 ) as described in 2 . 2 . The MCK promoter is well characterized for muscle - specific expression [ 13 , 577 - 579 ] , and is active upon muscle differentiation into myotubes , but not in undifferentiated 75 myoblasts [ 580 , 581 ] . Following selection and isolation of individual clones of L6 myoblasts stably transfected with MCK - FLAG - DN - p38MAPK ( as described in 2 . 2 ) , expression of FLAG - DN - p38MAPK α or β was observed in differentiated myotubes but not in myoblasts ( Figure 10 ) , consistent with known MCK promoter function . Figure 9 . Creation of cDNA constructs to express DN - p38MAPK α and DN - p38MAPK β in L6 cells in a differentiation - dependent manner . Diagram of DNA constructs used to stably express DN - p38MAPK α ( 180 AGF 182 ) - FLAG or FLAG - DN - p38MAPK β ( 180 AGF 182 ) in differentiated L6 myotubes . In both cases , the mouse muscle creatine kinase promoter [ 305 ] drives expression of the mutant p38MAPK which is followed by a poly - adenosine ( poly A ) sequence . Figure 10 . Expression of DN - p38MAPK α or DN - p38MAPK β in differentiated L6 myotubes but not myoblasts . Colonies of single clones of L6 myoblasts stably transfected with MCK - DN - p38MAPK α or MCK - DN - p38MAPK β ( as described in 2 . 2 , see Figure 9 ) , as myoblasts ( MB ) or differentiated myotubes ( MT ) were lysed in LSB , and whole cell lysates were subject to immunoblotting . Shown is a representative immunoblot detecting expression of the FLAG - epitope . 76 In order to assess if DN - p38MAPK expressed in MCK - DN - p38MAPK cell lines was able to interfere with endogenous p38MAPK function , the phosphorylation of p38MAPK by several distinct stimuli was assessed . In MCK - DN - p38MAPK β myotubes , the increase in p38MAPK following stimulation with insulin , arsenite , and hyperosmolar stressors sorbitol , mannitol and NaCl was greatly reduced compared to untransfected L6 myotubes ( L6 - WT ) ( Figure 11 ) . Similar results were obtained in multiple clones of MCK - DN - p38MAPK β myotubes as well as in MCK - DN - p38MAPK α myotubes ( data not shown ) . Note that the anti - phospho - p38MAPK antibody used detects the phosphorylated form of all p38MAPK isoforms . That an increase in basal p38MAPK phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing DN - p38MAPK ( Figure 11 ) may be the consequence of long - term feedback mechanisms that attempt to increase basal p38MAPK activity to normal levels . Since DN - p38MAPK cannot be phosphorylated due to mutation ( T180A and Y182F ) , that DN - p38MAPKs inhibit the stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous p38MAPK suggests that this results from competition with upstream signals for phosphorylation of endogenous p38MAPK , such as MKK3 / 6 and / or TAB1 , thereby silencing activation the endogenous kinases . 77 Figure 11 . Stable expression of DN - p38MAPK β in differentiated myotubes reduces insulin and stress - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation . Differentiated wild - type L6 myotubes ( L6 - WT ) or L6 myotubes stably expressing DN - p38MAPK β were stimulated with either 100 nM insulin for 20 min , 0 . 5 mM arsenite for 30 min , 0 . 5 M mannitol for 20 min , 0 . 6 M sorbitol for 20 min or 0 . 5 M NaCl for 20 min , as indicated . Subsequently , total cellular lysates were prepared in LSB , and subject to immunoblotting . Shown are representative immunoblots detecting phospho - p38MAPK . Also shown is a graph depicting mean intensity of phospho - 38MAPK signal ± SE from 5 independent experiments . Although p38MAPK α and β expression , when driven by the MCK promoter , occurs in differentiated L6 myotubes but not in L6 myoblasts ( Figure 10 ) , it is possible that gradual activation of the MCK promoter during the process of differentiation can result in some expression of DN - p38MAPK prior to differentiation , which may in turn affect the efficiency of differentiation . To assess this possibility , the extent of myotube formation was determined by counting the number of nuclei per myotube in DN - p38MAPK α and β cell lines relative to L6 - WT cells . Several clones of MCK - DN - p38MAPK α or β cells exhibited differentiation similar to 78 L6 - WT : approximately 80 % of nuclei were observed in cells with > 2 nuclei , and approximately 50 % of nuclei were in cells with > 5 nuclei ( Figure 12 ) . However , one clone of MCK - DN - p38MAPK β ( Figure 12 , p38 β DN clone 3 ) exhibited reduced differentiation into myotubes , but this is not likely due to p38MAPK expression , and this clone was not examined further . Figure 12 . MCK - DN - p38MAPK α and β cell lines exhibit normal differentiation into myotubes , as assessed by cell morphology . L6 - WT or L6 - DN - p38MAPK cell lines , as indicated , were differentiated into myotubes , fixed , and stained with Geimsa , as per manufacturer’s instructions . Shown are representative images acquired by light microscopy . Although expression of DN - p38MAPK α or β did not affect myotube differentiation as assessed morphologically , other markers of differentiation were also examined . Endogenous GLUT4 is expressed in differentiated L6 myotubes but not in myoblasts , and p38MAPK is known to regulate the transcription factors MEF2 and MyoD [ 130 , 576 , 582 , 583 ] , which are in turn implicated in regulating GLUT4 transcription [ 584 - 586 ] . Thus , the amount of GLUT4 79 protein was also examined in MCK - DN - p38MAPK α and β cell lines upon differentiation . Interestingly , MCK - DN - p38MAPK α cell lines exhibited decreased GLUT4 expression , whereas MCK - DN - p38MAPK β had an increase in GLUT4 expression ( Figure 13 ) . These results suggest that p38MAPK α functions to upregulate GLUT4 expression , whereas p38MAPK β downregulates levels of the transporter , both likely acting at the level of transcription . Although DN - p38MAPK α and β seem to have partly overlapping effects ( Figure 10 , Figure 14 ) , the different outcomes of expression of DN - p38MAPK α and β on GLUT4 expression suggest that the dominant - negative mutants of p38MAPK retain specific and distinct functions with regards to regulation of GLUT4 protein amount . The alterations in GLUT4 protein levels demonstrate that , although a robust inhibition of p38MAPK activity was achieved , MCK - DN - 38MAPK are not a practical strategy to study p38MAPK contribution to GLUT4 transport activity . These results also demonstrate that transgenic or knockout mouse models for p38MAPK α or β activity deficiency are likely to be impractical models for the study of some aspects p38MAPK function within differentiated muscle , such as the regulation of glucose uptake independent of the amount cell surface glucose transporters . Thus , strategies considered for further experiments ( adenovirus gene deliver and siRNA gene silencing ) were employed after L6 cells have differentiated into myotubes . Importantly , these subsequent studies were done in L6 - GLUT4 myc cells ( see Section 2 . 2 ) , which express GLUT4 myc from a heterologous promoter , thereby eliminating the possible confounding effect of altered GLUT4 expression to p38MAPK action in insulin - stimulated glucose transport . 80 Figure 13 . MCK - DN - p38MAPK myotubes exhibit altered endogenous GLUT4 expression . Two distinct clones of each of MCK - DN - p38MAPK α and MCK - DN - p38MAPK β ( as indicted ) were differentiated into myotubes , and then subject to total membrane preparation . LSB was added to purified total membrane fractions , and samples were subject to immunoblotting using anti - GLUT4 specific antibodies . Shown is an immunoblot representative of 3 independent experiments . Adenovirus - mediated delivery of DN - p38MAPK cDNA . Adenovirus - mediated infection of L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes resulted in a 50 - fold overexpression of the DN - p38MAPK α or β mutants relative to endogenous wild type p38MAPK α or β , as determined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates ( data not shown ) . In separate experiments , adenovirus infection efficiency was consistently 80 % or higher , assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy ( data not shown ) . Expression of either DN - p38MAPK α or β reduced the phosphorylation of p38MAPK stimulated by either sub - maximal ( 10 nM ) or maximal ( 100nM ) insulin by ~ 70 % , assessed in whole cell lysates ( Figure 14 ) . As expected , neither mutant of p38MAPK altered total GLUT4 protein amount in L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes , which in these cells consists predominantly of exogenously - expressed GLUT4 myc ( data not shown ) . Therefore , these mutants inhibit activation of p38MAPK by insulin by functionally sequestering the upstream activators such as TAB1 and / or MKK3 / 6 away from endogenous p38MAPK α and β , thereby also preventing action of endogenous p38MAPK on downstream targets . 81 Figure 14 . Expression of DN - p38MAPK α or β by adenovirus results in inhibition of insulin - stimulated p38MAPK activation . L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes were infected with 2 . 5x10 5 PFU / well ( 24 - well plate ) of GFP , FLAG - DN - p38 α or FLAG - DN - p38 β adenovirus for 18 - 24 h . Myotubes were left unstimulated ( open bars ) or were stimulated with 10 ( gray bars ) or 100 nM insulin ( closed bars ) for 10 min , and total cellular lysates were prepared in LSB , and subject to immunoblotting . Shown are representative immunoblots detecting phospho - p38MAPK or FLAG .

Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2005 ) 146 : 3773 - 81 Adenovirus - mediated delivery of DR - p38MAPK α cDNA . WT - or DR - p38MAPK α was overexpressed in L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes via adenoviral delivery . We determined that infection of L6 myotubes with adenoviruses encoding either WT - or DR - p38MAPK α resulted in a similar insulin - responsive increase in total phospho - p38MAPK ( Figure 16A ) . The adenovirus infection was allowed to proceed for only 10 - 12h , and not for 18 - 24h as for DN - p38MAPK viruses , as longer times of infection with active p38MAPK ( either WT or DR ) resulted in much greater expression of exogenous p38MAPK and also large increases in basal p38MAPK phosphorylation ( ~ 20X normal ) which could not be further stimulated by insulin or hyperosmolar stress ( Z . Liu and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) . The immunoblots in Figure 16A show the slower migration of the FLAG - tagged transfected proteins compared to the endogenous p38 MAPK . In these experiments , the SDS - PAGE conditions were optimized to facilitate detection of the two bands , and this may explain why a doublet is now visible in the 82 control , untransfected cells , potentially reflecting more than one isoform of the endogenous enzyme . Determination of p38 MAPK action in vivo requires analysis of the phosphorylation of known targets , typically transcription factors such as MK - 2 , CREB and PRAK ( reviewed by [ 136 ] ) . Although MK - 2 , CREB and PRAK are phosphorylated in response to insulin in L6 myotubes , this effect is insensitive to the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 , and fully prevented by the MEK1 inhibitor PB98095 ( resulting in inhibition of Erk1 ) for phospho - CREB and PRAK ( Figure 15 ) . However , both hyperosmolar stress and anisomycin phosphorylate MK - 2 in an SB203580 - dependent , and therefore in a p38MAPK α and / or β - dependent manner ( Figure 15 ) . Hence , as a readout of the effectiveness of the WT - and DR - p38MAPK α to restore p38MAPK activity in the presence of SB203580 , we examined the phosphorylation of MK - 2 in response to hyperosmolar stress . In the presence of 10 μ M SB203580 , the hyperosmolarity - induced MK - 2 phosphorylation was reduced by 89 % in cells overexpressing WT - p38MAPK α , to a similar degree as in non - transfected cells . In contrast , SB203580 reduced MK - 2 phosphorylation by only 35 % in cells overexpressing DR - p38 α ( Figure 16 ) . Since adenovirus infection efficiency was consistently around 80 % ( assessed by bi - cistronic expression of eGFP AdEasy vector , data not shown ) , these results suggest that SB203580 is unable to inhibit cellular p38MAPK α activity in cells overexpressing DR - p38MAPK α , and thus , in conjunction with SB203580 , represents a useful tool to specifically assess p38MAPK function in L6 myotubes . 83 Figure 15 . Arsenite and hyperosmolar stress - simulated MK - 2 phosphorylation , but not phosphorylation of MK - 2 , PRAK or CREB by insulin , is dependent on p38MAPK α and / or β . Following serum deprivation , L6 myotubes were pre - incubated with either 10 μ M SB203580 , 50 μ M PD98095 , alone or in combination , for 20 min , and then stimulated with either 100 nM insulin ( 10 min ) , 0 . 5 M ( hyperosmolar ) NaCl ( 20 min ) , or 0 . 5 mM arsenite for 30 min , in the continued presence of the inhibitor ( s ) . Whole cell lysates were prepared and subject to immunoblotting . Shown in immunoblots representative of 4 independent experiments probed with phospho - CREB antibodies ( A i ) , that also recognize phosphorylated ATF - 1 , phospho - PRAK antibodies ( A ii ) or phospho - MK - 2 ( B ) . For the experiments to detect phosphorylated PRAK ( A ii ) , L6 myotubes were infected with 2 . 5x10 5 PFU / well ( 24 - well plate ) of PRAK adenovirus for 18 - 24 h , as phosphorylation of endogenous PRAK was not observed . 84 Figure 16 . Expression of DR - p38MAPK α prevents the inhibition the p38MAPK activity by SB203580 . L6 myotubes were infected with 2 . 5x10 5 PFU / well ( 24 - well plate ) of WT - p38 α or DR - p38 α adenovirus for 10 - 12 h . L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes were then pre - incubated with vehicle ( open bars ) or 10 μ M SB203580 ( closed bars ) for 20 min . Then , in the continued absence or presence of the drug , cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 10 min ( A ) or hyperosmolar ( 0 . 5 M ) NaCl for 20 min ( B , C ) , as indicated , and total cellular lysates were prepared in LSB , and subject to immunoblotting . Shown are representative immunoblots detecting either phospho - p38MAPK ( T180 / Y182 ) , p38MAPK α , or phospho - MK - 2 ( T334 ) , as indicated .

Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2005 ) 146 : 3773 - 81 siRNA - mediated gene silencing of p38MAPK α and β . To complement the above analysis , siRNA gene silencing to reduce p38MAPK α and / or β protein amounts in L6 myotubes was also employed . A 65 - 70 % reduction of p38MAPK α protein was achieved , as determined by immunoblotting whole cell lysates , and this reduction of p38MAPK α by siRNA did not appreciably affect expression of p38 β ( Figure 17A ) . Because currently available antibodies 85 specific to p38MAPK β are poor at detecting endogenous p38MAPK β protein in L6 myotubes , perhaps due to low levels of expression of this isoform in L6 myotubes , p38MAPK β protein levels were monitored by probing for the expression of the FLAG epitope in L6 - MCK - FLAG - DN - p38MAPK β stable cells following siRNA transfection . P38MAPK β siRNA gene silencing achieved a knockdown of 63 - 74 % of overexpressed FLAG - DN - p38MAPK β protein ( Figure 17B ) . The reduction in p38MAPK β by siRNA did not appreciably affect expression of p38MAPK α ( Figure 17 ) , indicating specificity of each siRNA for its cognate sequence . It is expected that endogenous p38MAPK β was reduced to a similar extent by p38MAPK β siRNA . In L6 myotubes transfected with siRNAs to both p38MAPK α and β , each isoform was reduced to the extent achieved when each siRNA was used separately ( Figure 17A and B ) . In addition , insulin - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation ( which detects the phosphorylation of all isoforms of p38MAPK ) was markedly inhibited by siRNA gene silencing of p38MAPK α alone or by combined siRNA to p38MAPK α and β , whereas siRNA gene silencing of p38MAPK β was without effect on p38MAPK phosphorylation ( Figure 17C ) . Thus , p38MAPK α appears to be the major isoform phosphorylated in response to insulin in L6 myotubes . Therefore , siRNA gene silencing of p38MAPK is yet another strategy to interfere with p38MAPK function in order to study p38MAPK in insulin action in L6 myotubes . 86 Figure 17 . siRNA gene silencing reduces p38MAPK α and β protein amounts and insulin - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation in L6 myotubes . L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes were transfected with 500 nM of either non - relevant ( NR ) siRNA , p38 α - or p38 β - specific siRNA , or both p38 α− and p38 β - specific siRNA together . Following serum starvation , cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 10 min , where indicated , and total cellular lysates were prepared in LSB , and subject to immunoblotting .

However , whether insulin activation of p38MAPK occurs via the well described stress response pathway that employs MKK3 and / or MKK6 , or whether it occurs via an autophosphorylation mechanism dependent on TAB1 [ 542 ] remains unknown . To distinguish between these two possibilities , we first examined the effect of the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 on p38MAPK phosphorylation . This drug is an ATP analogue that displaces ATP from the kinase pocket of p38MAPK α and β and inhibits p38MAPK activation only if it occurs by auto - phosphorylation [ 542 ] and Figure 5 . Pre - treatment of L6 myotubes with SB203580 resulted in a significant reduction of basal p38MAPK phosphorylation in L6 myotubes , by 28 . 5 ± 12 . 9 % ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 5 , Figure 18A ) . The presence of SB203580 resulted in complete inhibition of insulin - stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation ( 1 . 1 ± 6 . 2 % of uninhibited response , n = 5 , Figure 18A ) . However , hyperosmolarity - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation was largely unaffected ( 78 . 8 ± 4 . 3 % of the uninhibited response , n = 5 , Figure 18A ) . Moreover , p38MAPK phosphorylation observed following treatment of L6 myotubes with arsenite , and with hyperosmotic stressors mannitol and sorbitol , in the presence of SB203580 , resulted in 44 . 1 ± 13 . 4 % , 26 . 3 ± 14 . 1 % , and 56 . 7 ± 9 . 8 % , respectively , of the uninhibited response ( n = 5 , Figure 18A ) . This result suggests that p38MAPK phosphorylation following insulin stimulation occurs via auto - phosphorylation , and not via phosphorylation by MKK3 / 6 , as for some stressors . The difference in observed in p38MAPK phosphorylation mechanisms between various hyperosmolar treatments used may be due to their different cell permeability . Thus , in L6 myotubes , stressors activate p38MAPK , partly by differential dependence on a TAB1 - dependent auto - phosphorylation mechanism and on MKK3 / 6 trans - phosphorylation , whereas insulin only does so by TAB1 - dependent autophosphorylation . 88 Interestingly , in HEK293AD cells , insulin does not detectably stimulate p38MAPK phosphorylation , and the phosphorylation of p38MAPK by the same stimuli as examined in L6 myotubes is completely insensitive to SB203580 ( Figure 18B ) , showing that TAB1 - dependent autophosphorylation is not a general p38MAPK phenomenon , but a specialized process that occurs in only certain cells , under certain conditions , such as L6 myotubes stimulated with insulin . Figure 18 . SB203580 inhibits insulin - but not hyperosmolarity - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation . Following serum starvation , L6 myotubes were treated with 10 μ M SB203580 , or vehicle for 20 min , and then stimulated with insulin for 10 min , or hyperosmotic ( 0 . 5M ) NaCl , in the continued presence of the drug , followed by cell lysis in LSB . Shown is a representative immunoblot detecting phospho - p38MAPK . Also shown is a graph depicting mean phospho - 38MAPK signal intensity ± SE from 5 independent experiments , * < 0 . 05 . B . HEK293AD cells were serum starved for 3 h and then pre - treated with 10 μ M SB203580 for 20 min and then stimulated with 100 nM insulin ( 10 min ) , 0 . 5 mM arsenite ( 30 min ) , 0 . 5 M mannitol ( 20 min ) , 0 . 6 M sorbitol ( 20 min ) or 0 . 5 M NaCl ( 20 min ) in the continued presence of the inhibitor , as indicated . Whole cell lysates were prepared and subject to immunoblotting . Shown in an immunoblot representative of 3 independent experiments , detecting phosphorylated p38MAPK . 89 However , given that SB203580 is an ATP analogue , it is potentially able to inhibit the action of kinases other than p38MAPK [ 558 ] . Thus , although the differential sensitivity to SB203580 of the activation of p38MAPK by insulin and stressors in L6 myotubes distinguishes their pathways of activation , whether insulin causes p38MAPK auto - phosphorylation remains unclear . To test whether the action of SB203580 was due to inhibition of p38MAPK autophosphorylation , an SB203580 - insensitive mutant ( DR - p38MAPK ) of p38 MAPK was employed . Either DR - p38MAPK α or WT - p38MAPK α was expressed in L6 myotubes via adenovirus - mediated gene delivery , and the effect of SB203580 on p38MAPK phosphorylation was determined . In cells expressing WT - p38MAPK , insulin was unable to phosphorylate p38MAPK in the presence of SB203580 ( Figure 19 ) . However , as predicted , in cells expressing DR - p38MAPK α , insulin was able to stimulate p38MAPK phosphorylation even in the presence of SB203580 ( Figure 19 ) . Note that in Figure 19 , the decrease in basal p38MAPK phosphorylation by SB203580 in cells expressing DR - p38MAPK α reduces the absolute phospho - p38MAPK level observed upon insulin stimulation , whereas the fold increase is retained upon treatment with the hormone . These results indicate that p38MAPK phosphorylation following insulin stimulation occurs largely via auto - phosphorylation . Figure 19 . Expression of DR - but not WT - p38MAPK prevents SB203580 inhibition of insulin - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation . L6 myotubes were infected with 2 . 5x10 5 PFU / well ( 24 - well plate ) adenovirus particles encoding either DR - or WT - p38MAPK α , as indicated . Following serum starvation , L6 myotubes were treated with 10 μ M SB203580 , or vehicle for 20 min , and then stimulated with insulin for 10 min in the continued presence of the drug , followed by cell lysis in LSB . Shown is an immunoblot representative of 3 independent experiments detecting phospo - p38MAPK or p38MAPK α , as indicated . 90 To confirm that insulin - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation occurs via auto - phosphorylation , the binding of the adaptor TAB1 to p38MAPK was examined . Following various times of insulin or hyperosmolarity stimulation , phosphorylated p38MAPK was immunoprecipitated from L6 myotubes , and samples were subsequently subject to immunoblotting to detect possible co - precipitation of TAB1 ( Figure 20 ) . An increase in TAB1 co - precipitating with p38MAPK was observed following 5 , 10 or 20 min of insulin stimulation , but not following stimulation with 0 . 5M ( hyperosmolar ) NaCl . These results are consistent with insulin stimulation leading to p38MAPK autophosphorylation via a TAB1 - dependent mechanism , whereas hyperosmolar stress - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation occurs largely via phosphorylation by MKK3 / 6 . Figure 20 . Insulin - stimulated , but not hyperosmolarity - stimulated phospho - p38MAPK co - immunoprecipitates with TAB1 . Following serum starvation , L6 myotubes were pre - treated with 10 μ M SB203580 , or vehicle ( DMSO ) for 20 min and then stimulated with either 100 nM insulin or hyperosmolar ( 0 . 5 M ) NaCl , in the continued presence of the drug , as indicated . P38MAPK was precipitated from each sample , followed by immunoblotting to detect TAB1 or p38MAPK α , as indicated . Shown are immunoblots representative of 3 independent experiments . WCL , whole cell lysates . Thus , acute ( < 20 min ) insulin stimulation of L6 myotubes results in p38MAPK auto - phosphorylation via interaction with TAB1 , likely activating p38MAPK only in the cytosol [ 158 ] . However , prolonged insulin ( 8h ) has been shown to regulate DNA synthesis and transcription of certain p38 MAPK targets , such as c - fos and c - jun in L6 myotubes ( [ 587 ] and references therein ) , suggesting that p38MAPK may have distinct functions , and perhaps distinct mechanisms of activation , following prolonged versus acute stimulation with insulin . To test whether p38MAPK is activated differently by longer times of stimulation with insulin , the 91 sensitivity of p38MAPK to SB203580 was examined for various times of insulin treatment . Insulin stimulation of L6 myotubes for 5 - 15 min resulted in a robust 2 - fold phosphorylation of p38MAPK , which was completely inhibited by pre - treatment with SB203580 , whereas longer stimulation with insulin resulted in substantial SB203580 - insensitive p38MAPK phosphorylation ( Figure 21 ) . Figure 21 . Prolonged insulin stimulation results in shift to SB203580 - insensitive p38MAPK phosphorylation . Following serum starvation , L6 myotubes were pre - treated with 10 μ M SB203580 for 20 min , and then stimulated with 100 nM insulin for time indicated , in the continued presence or absence of the drug , followed by cell lysis in LSB . Shown is a representative immunoblot detecting phospho - p38MAPK in whole - cell lysates . Taken together , these results demonstrate that acute insulin stimulates p38MAPK autophosphorylation via a TAB1 - dependent mechanism and that prolonged insulin results in a shift to classical MKK3 / 6 - dependent p38MAPK phosphorylation . These results reflect the possible differential effect of acute and prolonged insulin stimulation , perhaps glucose metabolism and mitogenesis , respectively , and suggest p38MAPK may differently participate in each phase of insulin action . The acute stimulation of p38MAPK by TAB1 suggests that early times of insulin stimulation result in p38MAPK activation in the cytosol , and raise the important question of the possible role for p38MAPK in regulation of the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 and / or other cytosolic function ( s ) . 92 2 . 6 The role of p38MAPK in regulating insulin - stimulated glucose uptake independently of amount of cell - surface GLUT4 To assess the possible role of p38MAPK in insulin action , several molecular strategies for interfering with p38MAPK function were employed . Firstly , DN - p38MAPK was expressed in L6 myotubes by adenovirus - mediated gene delivery . Although this strategy successfully inhibited p38MAPK phosphorylation and activity ( Figure 14 ) , neither DN - p38MAPK α or β had any effect on insulin - stimulated glucose uptake ( Figure 22 ) . These results were contrary to our initial hypothesis , as they suggest that insulin - stimulated glucose uptake is independent of p38MAPK activity in L6 myotubes . Figure 22 . Expression of DN - p38MAPK does not affect insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes . L6 myotubes were infected with 2 . 5x10 5 PFU / well ( 24 - well plate ) adenovirus particles encoding either DN - p38MAPK α , DN - p38MAPK β , or GFP only , as indicated . Following serum starvation , L6 myotubes were stimulated with either 10 nM ( grey bars ) , 100 nM insulin ( closed bars ) or left unstimulated ( open bars ) for 10 min , followed by measurement of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake . Shown are the means ± SE from 7 independent experiments , of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake normalized to basal , GPF - expressing cells . Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2005 ) 146 : 3773 - 81 To examine whether the action of the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 to inhibit insulin - stimulated glucose uptake occurred by action on p38MAPK or on a different target , adenovirus - mediated gene delivery was employed to express DR - p38MAPK or WT - p38MAPK in L6 93 myotubes . Although DR - p38MAPK α was able to nearly completely rescue p38MAPK activity in the presence of SB203580 ( Figure 16 ) , pretreatment of L6 myotubes with SB203580 in cells expressing DR - p38MAPK α resulted in similar inhibition of insulin - stimulated glucose uptake as cells expressing WT - p38MAPK α ( Figure 23 ) . These results are consistent with those obtained by expression of DN - p38MAPK α and β , and suggest that p38MAPK activity is not required for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake . Therefore , we must conclude that SB203580 - inhibition of glucose uptake occurs by inhibition of a target other than p38MAPK . Figure 23 . SB203580 inhibits insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes expressing DR - p38MAPK α or WT - p38MAPK α . L6 myotubes were infected with 2 . 5x10 5 PFU / well ( 24 - well plate ) adenovirus particles encoding either DR - or WT - p38MAPK α , as indicated . Following serum starvation , basal L6 myotubes were treated with 10 μ M SB203580 ( hatched bars ) , or vehicle ( open bars ) , for 30 min . Insulin - stimulated L6 myotubes were stimilary treated with 10 μ M SB203580 ( closed bars ) , or vehicle ( grey bars ) , with 100 nM insulin present during the final 10 min . Subsequently , 2 - deoxyglucose uptake we measured . Shown are the means ± SE from 7 independent experiments , of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake normalized to basal , WT - 38MAPK α expressing cells . * , p < 0 . 05 . Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2005 ) 146 : 3773 - 81 To confirm the results obtained by overexpression of p38MAPK mutants , we employed siRNA - mediated gene silencing of p38MAPK α and β isoforms . Although p38MAPK α and β expression and activity were successfully reduced by this method ( Figure 17 ) , insulin - stimulated glucose uptake was unaffected in cells depleted of p38MAPK α , p38MAPK β or both isoforms together ( Figure 24 ) . These results confirm the observations made with DN - p38MAPKs and with 94 DR - p38MAPK α in the presence of SB203580 , that insulin stimulated glucose uptake is independent of p38MAPK activity . Figure 24 . Insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in unaffected in cells depleted of p38 MAPK α and / or β by siRNA gene silencing . L6 myotubes were transfected with siRNA to p38MAPK α and p38MAPK β , alone or in combination , as indicated . Following serum starvation , L6 myotubes were treated with insulin for 10 min , followed by measurement of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake . Shown are the means ± SE from 7 independent experiments , of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake normalized to basal , NR siRNA transfected cells . Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2005 ) 146 : 3773 - 81 Although several molecular methods of perturbing p38MAPK function consistently showed that p38MAPK function is not required for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake , each method failed to achieve the level of p38MAPK inhibition observed by pretreatment of L6 myotubes with SB203580 . In order to determine if further inhibition of p38MAPK is required to observe an inhibition of insulin stimulation of glucose uptake , additional chemical inhibitors of p38MAPK were examined . One such inhibitor , SB220025 , was able to fully inhibit p38MAPK activity at a similar concentration as SB203580 ( 10 μ M ) , as measured by hyperosmolarity - stimulated MK - 2 phosphorylation ( Figure 25A ) . Although SB203580 inhibited insulin - stimulated glucose uptake as previously observed , SB220025 had no effect in this assay under similar conditions ( Figure 25B ) . These results confirm the observations made with DN - and DR - 95 p38MAPK and siRNA gene - silencing reduction of p38MAPK activity , that that insulin stimulated glucose uptake is independent of p38MAPK activity . Moreover , the non - p38MAPK target of SB203580 is not recognized by SB220025 . Figure 25 . Insulin stimulation is insensitive to the p38MAPK inhibitor SB220025 . Following serum starvation , L6 myotubes were pre - treated with either 10 μ M SB203580 , SB220035 , or with vehicle ( DMSO ) for 20 min , and then stimulated with insulin ( 10 min ) hyperosmolar ( 0 . 5 M ) NaCl ( 20 min ) , in the continued presence of the inhibitors , as indicated . A . Whole cell lysates were prepared , followed by immunoblotting for phospho - MK - 2 and shown is an immunoblot representative of 3 independent experiments . B 2 - deoxyglucose uptake was measured and shown are the means ± SE from 3 independent experiments , * , p < 0 . 05 , relative to vehicle - treated , insulin stimulated condition . Taken together , these results demonstrate that insulin - stimulated glucose uptake is independent of p38MAPK activity . Furthermore , SB203580 inhibition of insulin - stimulated glucose uptake occurs by inhibition of a target other than p38MAPK . Although SB203580 does not inhibit glucose uptake when included only the in the transport solution ( no pre - incubation , without stimulation with insulin ) [ 168 ] , it is still possible that the inhibitor acts on GLUT4 itself . 96 To address this possibility , the ability of SB203580 to prevent the efflux of 3 - O - methylglucose from L6 myotubes was assessed . After incubating L6 myotubes with 3 - O - methylglucose for 10 minutes , cells were washed repeatedly with either saline alone , with a saline solution containing 20 mM glucose to competitively prevent 3 - O - methylglucose efflux , or saline with 10 mM SB203580 ( Figure 26 ) . Similar to 20 mM glucose , supplementation of the saline stop solution with 10 μ M SB203580 prevented 3 - O - methylglucose efflux . These results suggest that SB203580 is capable of quickly inhibiting the transport step , with a slight preference for the insulin - stimulated state . Since this rapid inhibition of glucose transport by SB203580 is similar to that of protease inhibitors [ 588 , 589 ] , and forskolin [ 590 ] , which are known to bind to GLUT4 directly , SB203580 likely may act in a similar fashion to these compounds , namely through direct inhibition of GLUT4 . The smaller effect of SB203580 on basal glucose uptake , whether in the experimental design ( see Section 2 . 2 ) or in the longer pre - incubation experiments described in figure ( Figure 6 ) , is probably the result of a small contribution of the endogenous GLUT1 to basal - state glucose uptake [ 521 ] . Indeed , GLUT1 is much less susceptible than GLUT4 to inhibition by a variety of unrelated small molecules such as forskolin and indinavir . Figure 26 . SB203580 inhibits 3 - O - methyl efflux from L6 myotubes . L6 myotubes were loaded with 3 - O - methylglucose for 10 min , followed by washing of the cells three times in either saline alone , or saline supplemented with either 20 mM glucose or 10 μ M SB203580 , as indicated . Remaining cell - associated 3 - O - methylglucose uptake was determined and shown are the means ± SE from 3 independent experiments , * , < 0 . 05 , relative to saline only washing condition . 97 Taken together , these results demonstrate that insulin - stimulated glucose uptake is independent of p38MAPK activity . This conclusion is supported by other recent studies . Expression of dominant - negative forms of MKK6 and p38MAPK did not influence insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 535 ] , although this study may not detect compensatory changes in GLUT4 expression following p38MAPK inactivation ( see Figure 13 ) , and a dominant - negative MKK6 mutant likely does affect TAB - 1 dependent p38MAPK autophosphorylation [ 542 ] . In soleus muscle and adipocytes isolated from mice with a genetic loss of p38MAPK β , insulin - stimulated glucose uptake was indistinguishable from that in tissues obtained from wild - type littermates [ 591 ] . Also , an apparent dissociation of insulin - stimulated p38MAPK phosphorylation and inhibition of glucose uptake by SB203580 was observed under some conditions [ 165 , 591 ] . However , a role for a small subpopulation of insulin - stimulated p38MAPK α , the major isoform phosphorylated in response to insulin in L6 myotubes ( Figure 17 ) , compared to the bulk basal phosphorylated kinase cannot be excluded by this studies . Thus , the work presented in this Chapter conclusively demonstrates that p38MAPK activity is not required for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes . Other stimuli that stimulate SB203580 - sensitive glucose uptake ( see Section 2 . 1 ) likely also do not require p38MAPK activity . Furthermore , SB203580 inhibition of insulin - stimulated glucose uptake occurs by inhibition of a target other than p38MAPK , one possibility being GLUT4 itself . 2 . 7 Discussion & conclusions Taken together , the results presented in this Chapter show that acute insulin stimulation results in p38MAPK autophosphorylation via interaction with TAB1 . In addition , upon prolonged insulin stimulation ( > 20 min ) , p38MAPK remains phosphorylated , but this phosphorylation appears to shift to an MKK3 / 6 - dependent mechanism . Further , insulin stimulation of glucose uptake does not depend on p38MAPK in L6 myotubes , and inhibition of insulin - stimulated glucose uptake by the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 results from action of 98 the drug on a p38MAPK - independent target . Examination of what other role ( s ) p38MAPK may play in insulin action remains to be examined , although several interesting possibilities exist . Finally , substantial evidence argues that insulin stimulates the glucose transport activity of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane . Mechanism linking activated insulin receptor and p38MAPK activation . The mechanism by which the interaction of p38MAPK with TAB1 is regulated by insulin thereby resulting in p38MAPK auto - phosphorylation remains unclear . However , previous studies have shown that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D resulted in inhibition of insulin - stimulated activation of p38MAPK but not PI3K and p70 S6K [ 587 ] . This suggests a link between the actin cytoskeleton and p38MAPK phosphorylation , and insulin causes actin filament remodeling [ 60 ] . In addition , it has been proposed that TAB1 and p38MAPK form a complex with TNF - receptor - associated factor 6 ( TRAF6 ) to allow for p38MAPK autophosphorylation [ 542 ] , and formation of this complex could be the stage regulated by insulin , possibly through phosphorylation of other post - translocation modification of either TRAF6 or TAB1 . Interestingly , acute insulin stimulation for as little as 5 min also results in phosphorylation of MKK3 / 6 ( W . Niu and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , suggesting that although the classical pathway of p38MAPK phosphorylation becomes active , p38MAPK association with TAB1 sequesters p38MAPK away from MKK3 / 6 , as has been suggested following interleukin - 1 β stimulation of cardiomyocytes [ 158 ] . During prolonged insulin stimulation , p38MAPK phosphorylation becomes dependent on MKK3 / 6 , which would suggest dissociation from TAB1 . The mechanism by which prolonged insulin may cause disruption of the TAB1 - TRAF6 - p38MAPK complex is an interesting question yet to be explored . 99 Possible specific function ( s ) of cytosolic p38MAPK in insulin action Although the neither the insulin - stimulated increase in glucose uptake nor the increase in cell surface GLUT4 requires p38MAPK activity , the role of p38MAPK activated by insulin remains an important question . P38MAPK has been implicated in many cytosolic processes , including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , protein degradation , and membrane traffic . Importantly , the role of p38MAPK may be functionally redundant in L6 myocytes , and p38MAPK activity may only become important when other processes become compromised , such as in insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus . In addition to requiring an intact actin cytoskeketon for phosphorylation by insulin ( as discussed above ) , p38MAPK may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in L6 cells . p38MAPK is associated with actin filaments in differentiated muscle and activation of p38MAPK by anisomycin can prevent actin depolymerization caused by cytochalasin D treatment [ 592 ] . Also , p38MAPK is required for actin stress fiber maintenance [ 593 ] and for stimulated forms of actin rearrangements [ 594 - 596 ] . Insulin requires dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton for GLUT4 translocation [ 60 , 61 , 597 ] and this process becomes compromised in cellular models of insulin resistance [ 62 ] . Thus , although SB203580 does not affect insulin - stimulated actin rearrangement in L6 myotubes under normal conditions ( C . Huang and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , p38MAPK may yet have a role in compensating for impaired actin cytoskeleton , which appears to occur in the initial stages of insulin resistance in muscle [ 62 ] . Insulin may also regulate the degradation of GLUT4 . Considering that the half - life of GLUT4 in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes is approximately 50h [ 293 ] , that 24h of insulin treatment can reduce GLUT4 protein levels by 70 % [ 598 ] suggests that this occurs by increasing GLUT4 degradation ; importantly , this reduction in GLUT4 content was prevented by SB203580 [ 598 ] . Although SB203580 may bind directly to endofacial portions of GLUT4 and thus artificially alter its recognition by the protein degradation machinery , by siRNA gene silencing , p38MAPK α has been implicated in Cbl - dependent Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) degradation [ 599 ] . Consistent with possible regulation of GLUT4 degradation , the transporter is 100 SUMOylated [ 600 ] , a modification involved in protein stability ( reviewed by [ 601 ] ) . In addition , GLUT4 associates with proteins involved in SUMO modification , mUbc9 [ 602 ] and Daxx [ 600 ] . Taken together , these results suggest a possible role for p38MAPK in insulin regulation of GLUT4 degradation , perhaps via changes in the SUMO modification of the transporter or its interactions with mUbc9 and / or Daxx . p38MAPK may also play a role in regulation of membrane traffic as the kinase is required for phosphorylation of the EGFR in response to irradiation [ 603 ] and chemotherapeutic agents [ 603 , 604 ] , which result in rapid EGFR internalization [ 605 ] through a clathrin - dependent mechanism [ 603 ] . p38MAPK is also involved in the phosphorylation of early endosomal proteins EEA1 [ 145 , 603 , 606 ] , GDI [ 603 ] , and rabenosyn - 5 [ 145 ] and is involved in mu - opioid receptor endocytosis [ 145 ] and M . tuberculosis phagosome maturation arrest [ 606 ] . Thus , p38MAPK may participate in insulin - stimulated early endosomal membrane traffic of GLUT4 , a phenomenon that may not be revealed by acute examination of GLUT4 membrane traffic ( < 1 h ) , given that insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation involves exocytosis of post - endosomal GLUT4 - storage vesicles that may require longer that 1h to form following transit through early endosomes ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . Interestingly , Clarke et al . [ 607 ] showed that p38MAPK is required for acute translocation of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 ( nSMase2 ) to the plasma membrane following stimulation of A549 epithelial cells with TNF - α . Although lipid signaling , particularly signaling mediated by sphingomyelin , ceramide ( formed by the action of sphingomyelinases ) and other sphingomyelin metabolites is a remarkably complex and interconnected network ( reviewed by ( 113 ) , the action of certain lipids such as ceramide in modulating insulin action have been extensively described ( ( [ 62 ] and reviewed by [ 608 ] ) . Furthermore , insulin stimulation of PI3K was found to be impaired in a SMase - deficient cell line [ 609 ] , suggesting that PM lipids may modulate insulin sensitivity . These studies , taken together , suggest that examination of the possible role of p38MAPK in sphingomyelin metabolism may reveal an important role for the kinase in insulin action and / or the development of insulin resistance . 101 P38MAPK activation by autophosphorylation may represent a unique function of p38MAPK with respect to regulation of energy availability . Aside from insulin , activation of AMP - activated protein kinase also results in p38MAPK phosphorylation [ 610 ] . Interestingly , following the drop in cellular ATP associated with ischemia in cardiomyocytes , p38MAPK was phosphorylated , which was inhibited by kinase - dead AMPK α 2 , but not genetic knockout of MKK3 [ 546 ] . Furthermore , ischemia resulted in recruitment of both AMPK and p38MAPK to TAB1 [ 546 ] . These results suggest that , like insulin , a drop in cellular energy in the form of decreased ATP and subsequent activation of AMPK results in p38MAPK activation via interaction with TAB1 . The activation of p38MAPK by a common mechanism , that of the interaction with TAB1 , by two separate stimuli ( insulin and the energy sensor AMPK ) that are involved in regulating energy storage and usage give strength to the idea that p38MAPK has an important function in this aspect of metabolism . Although not revealed by our studies so far , it is conceiveable that p38MAPK activated by insulin and AMPK may have several potential functions essential for regulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 function . It is possible that modulation of insulin action and glucose metabolism in muscle cells , such as by a possible p38MAPK - dependent production of ceramide , could have long - term consequences not examined by the studies described here of acute insulin action . Thus , studies that examine these possible roles of p38MAPK > 1 h after activation of the kinase by an acute ( ie . 10 min ) insulin stimulation may reveal the function of the TAB1 - activated p38MAPK in insulin action . Furthermore , as any role of p38MAPK may be functionally redundant , examination of partially compromised signaling pathways , such as in cellular models of insulin resistance , may be required to reveal the role of p38MAPK in insulin action . As has been revealed by the study of the possible role of p38MAPK in regulation of insulin - stimulated glucose uptake , the sole reliance on pharmacological inhibitors is unwise due to possible off - target effects , and multiple distinct approaches should be employed . These future experiments could reveal such a role for p38MAPK as a potentially important drug target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus . 102 Possible target ( s ) SB203580 resulting in inhibition of glucose uptake . The results presented here ( 2 . 6 ) demonstrate that SB203580 inhibits insulin - stimulated glucose uptake independently of p38MAPK activity . Hence , determining the target by which SB203580 inhibits glucose uptake is a question worth addressing , as it may reveal cellular targets regulated by insulin that contribute to modulation of glucose uptake . The existence of ATP - binding motifs in GLUT family members has been demonstrated [ 256 , 611 - 613 ] , and have been proposed to module hexose transport activity in GLUT1 by mutagenesis studies [ 614 , 615 ] , or by measurement of transport kinetics in the presence of ATP or ATP - mimetic drugs followed by structure modeling [ 256 , 274 , 611 , 613 , 616 , 617 ] . Interestingly , ATP binding to GLUT1 causes the transporter to undergo conformational changes , as seen by change in exofacial trypsin digest of the transporter in the presence of ATP [ 274 ] . Of the three proposed endofacial GLUT1 ATP - binding motifs , one is well conserved , 349 GRRTLHLLGLAGM 262 in GLUT4 , and two partly are conserved , 128 GLANAVAS 136 and 241 ARKSLKRL 248 [ 616 ] . Since ATP binding to GLUT1 is proposed to inhibit transport activity [ 274 , 616 ] , binding of ATP or ATP analogues to GLUT4 may also inhibit GLUT4 transport activity . Since SB203580 inhibits kinases as a result of being an ATP analogue , and thus displaces ATP from the kinase active site [ 93 ] , it is possible that this drug affects glucose transport by binding to partly conserved endofacial ATP - binding regions in GLUT4 . Consistent with endofacial binding of SB203580 to GLUT4 , the drug does not demonstrate competitive inhibition of 3 - O - methylglucose uptake , representative of glucose influx [ 569 ] , indicating that SB203580 does not act by binding to the exofacial glucose - binding site of GLUT4 . A model in which SB203580 binds to endofacial portions of GLUT4 , such as ATP binding sites , could result in either direct occlusion of the endofacial glucose - binding site ( competitive inhibition for glucose efflux ) , prevention of GLUT4 enzymatic turnover ( non - competitive inhibition ) or both ( mixed inhibition ) . Since SB203580 inhibits glucose influx under some conditions , such as following insulin stimulation ( Figure 6 ) , mixed inhibition seems most likely . If mixed inhibition by SB203580 occurs , it is possible that GLUT4 - dependent glucose efflux may be more sensitive to inhibition by SB203580 than glucose influx . This could occur if the K I for competitive inhibition by SB203580 of the endofacial portion of GLUT4 is much less than the K I for the non - 103 competitive inhibition component . Consistent with this possibility , adding 10 μ M SB203580 directly to the transport solution does not affect 2 - deoxyglucose uptake ( glucose influx ) in L6 myotubes , and 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 168 ] but this concentration of inhibitor does inhibit 3 - O - methylglucose efflux from L6 - myotubes ( Figure 26 ) . Also , Holman & col . [ 165 ] recently showed that SB203580 is either a competitive inhibitor for glucose analogue efflux or a non - competitive inhibitor of GLUT4 in rat adipocytes , depending on conditions examined . Hence , these results suggests that SB203580 , when present at 10 μ M SB203580 ( as when added only in the glucose transport stop solution , Figure 26 ) , likely inhibits GLUT4 function by binding to an endofacial site on the transporter . This could result in an indirect conformational change or altered conformational flexibility of GLUT4 which may then impact on GLUT4functional turnover . On the other hand , when L6 myotubes are pre - treated with 10 μ M SB203580 and then the drug is subsequently removed by washing prior to 2 - deoxyglucose uptake measurement ( Figure 6 ) , it is possible that a different mechanism of SB203580 - mediated inhibition of glucose uptake may occur than when the drug is added only during measurement of transport . Since SB203580 is a hydrophobic compound , it is possible that the prolonged time in the presence of the drug ( typically 40 min ) allows accumulation in additional cellular membranes , perhaps reflecting limitations by slow intracellular diffusion or membrane traffic mechanisms . It is also conceivable that , under pre - treatment followed by washout conditions , the concentration of SB203580 may be less than 10 μ M as a result of washout , and thus the inhibition of glucose uptake by SB203580 may more likely occur as a result of SB203580 alteration of insulin signaling . However , SB203580 is hydrophobic and may be effectively retained in membranes during attempted washout . Hence , it is possible that under prolonged incubation , SB203580 may target proteins other than GLUT4 , resulting in inhibition of glucose uptake . In support of such a conclusion , previously unknown targets of SB203580 were detected some with IC 50 values similar or lower to p38MAPK , including RICK ( rip - like interacting caspase - like apoptosis - regulatory protein kinase ) , CK1 , GAK ( cyclin G - associated kinase ) , protein kinase N β , Janus kinase 1 and JNK1 / 2 [ 618 ] . Indeed , under certain in vitro reaction conditions , the IC 50 of JNK1 and JNK2 can be 13 μ M and 0 . 7 μ M , respectively , making SB203580 a much more potent 104 inhibitor of JNK1 / 2 than previously reported . However , the JNK inhibitor SP600125 had virtually no effect on insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes ( W . Niu and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , rat neonatal myotubes [ 619 ] or primary rat adipocytes [ 620 ] . It is therefore difficult to generate a comprehensive list of possible relevant SB203580 targets in L6 myotubes . In the absence of additional experimental analysis , at present , the simplest scenario is that SB203580 has only one target which results in inhibition of glucose uptake , that being an endofacial portion of GLUT4 that may be a partly - conserved ATP - binding site . Regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity Since the mechanism of GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface was first proposed by Cushman et al . [ 621 ] and Suzuki et al . [ 622 ] and subsequent identification of GLUT4 [ 11 ] , there have been many observations that this increase in cell surface GLUT4 is insufficient to explain the increase in glucose uptake observed for insulin and other stimuli . A complete summary of these experiments and possible explanations are presented in Section 7 ( Appendix ) . Of note , several of these studies provide direct evidence that insulin also modulates GLUT4 intrinsic activity . Importantly , such studies quantitatively measure cell surface GLUT4 by detection of an exofacial epitope in intact cells , and can exclude participation of other glucose transporters to the observed rate of glucose uptake . Treatment of L6 myotubes with the insulin signaling intermediate phosphatidylinositol - ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) results in an increase in GLUT4 on the cell surface without a corresponding increase in glucose uptake [ 623 ] , suggesting that insulin , by a separate mechanism , also signals to increase GLUT4 transporter activity . In the same cells , insulin stimulation results in 2 - fold increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc , and a slightly larger , 2 . 5 - fold increase in glucose uptake [ 528 ] . Interestingly , in brown adipocytes from transgenic mice that express GLUT4 myc , the observed 2 - fold increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc is much less than the 6 . 1 - fold increase in the rate of glucose uptake , although all glucose uptake occurs through GLUT4 [ 532 ] . It is possible that insulin , in a PIP 3 - dependent manner , causes exocytosis of transport - inactive GLUT4 , and via a distinct signaling mechanism , activates the transporters for 105 hexose uptake . Depending on the magnitude of the specific GLUT4 - activating signal elicited by insulin in each cell type , a larger proportion of GLUT4 units could become activated . This interpretation could explain why similar gains in cell surface GLUT4 ( ~ 2x ) in L6 myotubes and mouse brown adipocytes yielded different increases in the rate of glucose uptake ( 2 . 5 and 6 . 1 fold , respectively ) . Consistent with these observations , treatment of 3T3 - L1 adipocytes with a cell - permeable phosphatidylinositide - binding peptide also increased cell surface GLUT4 without an increase in glucose uptake [ 624 ] . Insulin stimulation also sensitizes GLUT4 to inhibition by SB203580 , as seen by measurements of glucose 2 - deoxyglucose uptake ( Figure 6 ) and LC - ATB - BMPA photolabeling ( Figure 8 ) . As the K M of glucose influx is not affected by insulin or SB203580 [ 569 ] , the reduction in Bio - LC - ATB - BMPA photolabeling in drug - treated , insulin - stimulated conditions likely results from a conformational change that shields residues proximal to the exofacial sugar binding site from photolabeling . If SB203580 binds to an endofacial site on GLUT4 and results in mixed inhibition of glucose transport ( see above ) , then insulin appears to cause conformation changes in GLUT4 that may magnify the effect of SB203580 to alter exofacial regions of the transporter near the active glucose - binding site . Insulin would thus reduce the K I for the non - competitive portion of SB203580 mixed inhibition of GLUT4 . These residues proximal to the exofacial glucose binding - site may be involved in catalysis of glucose transport , and may be involved in the putative insulin - stimulated increase in the rate of glucose uptake . Thus , although p38MAPK does not participate in insulin - stimulated regulation of the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 , considerable evidence suggests that insulin , through an unknown mechanism , increases the glucose transport activity of GLUT4 , possibly through a conformational change that results in magnified sensitivity to inhibition by SB203580 for glucose influx . The activation of GLUT4 by insulin may be linked to the insulin - stimulated unmasking of an endofacial C - terminal epitope of the transporter reported in permeabilized skeletal muscle of mice overexpressing GLUT4 [ 625 ] and in L6 myotubes membrane lawns [ 313 ] . Such an altered conformation or epitope accessibility following insulin stimulation is reminiscent of the changes in antibody binding to both a cytosolic loop that joins TM 7 - 8 as well as the C - terminus of GLUT1 upon ATP binding [ 274 ] , which also alters glucose transport turnover . Thus , a model 106 emerges in which insulin , through an unknown mechanism , modulates the dissociation of a protein factor from GLUT4 , thereby resulting in an increase in glucose transport turnover , likely as a consequence of altered conformation or conformational flexibility of the transporter . A recent study has revealed many proteins that have altered binding to GLUT4 following insulin stimulation [ 626 ] , thereby providing a list of candidate regulators of GLUT4 turnover . However , both changes in endofacial epitope accessibility and glucose transporter turnover could instead be the result of insulin - stimulated alterations in the lipid microenvironment of GLUT4 . Simple models of such a possibility would involve , upon insulin stimulation , the relocation of GLUT4 to a microdomain of the PM rich in a different subset of lipids , or of metabolism of lipids surrounding GLUT4 , which in turn may alter the transporter’s conformation or conformational flexibility . Such a possibility is further discussed in Section 6 . 1 and may reveal the mechanism of the regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity . In addition , regulated post - translational modification of GLUT4 could also result in changes in GLUT4 intrinsic activity . Earlier studies have described a phosphorylation site on GLUT4 at S488 [ 627 ] , and agents that increase GLUT4 phosphorylation also reduce GLUT4 transport , such as isoproterenol [ 627 ] , parathyroid hormone [ 628 ] , a rise in intracellular calcium [ 629 ] , and dibutyryl - cAMP [ 630 ] . Those studies suggested that phosphorylation on S488 was inversely related to glucose transport activity . However , this interpretation was subsequently challenged . No correlation was observed between isoproterenol - stimulated phosphorylation of GLUT4 and decreased transport activity [ 631 ] . Expression of GLUT4 mutated at S488 resulted in complete loss of phosphorylation without affecting basal or dibutyryl - cAMP - inhibited glucose uptake activity [ 630 ] . Also , phosphorylation of GLUT4 did not affect its transport activity in reconstituted vesicles in vitro [ 632 ] . Moreover , insulin did not alter phosphorylation of GLUT4 [ 627 , 631 - 634 ] . Hence , the phosphorylation of GLUT4 likely does not regulate its intrinsic activity , although this modification may contribute to its membrane traffic [ 635 , 636 ] . However , several other regulated post - translational modifications of GLUT4 are possible . The voltage - gated channel Kv1 . 5 is reversibly SUMOylated by Ubc9 in vitro and in cells and this modification results in a 15 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage - dependence of steady - state inactivation [ 637 ] . Interestingly , GLUT4 is also SUMOylated [ 600 ] , possibly by association with 107 mUbc9 [ 602 ] . Thus , examination of possible regulated post - translational modifications of GLUT4 such as SUMO may reveal the molecular basis of regulated GLUT4 glucose turnover . In summary , the results presented in this chapter demonstrate that insulin stimulates the auto - phosphorylation of p38MAPK via interaction with TAB1 , activating p38MAPK within the cytosol . Although the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 results in selective inhibition of insulin - stimulated glucose uptake independently of the amount of cell surface GLUT4 , p38MAPK is not involved in insulin - stimulated glucose uptake . Instead , the inhibitor SB203580 inhibits insulin - stimulated glucose uptake by a p38MAPK - independent target , possibly by binding to an insulin - stimulated GLUT4 conformation state that may reflect an increased glucose transport activity of GLUT4 . 108 Chapter 3 3 The binding of p38MAPK and other proteins to GLUT4 endofacial motifs in L6 cells All results presented in this Chapter are from experiments performed by Costin N . Antonescu with the exception of that presented in Figure 27 , performed by Vincent Poon . 109 3 . 1 Introduction GLUT4 is an integral membrane protein with 12 membrane - spanning regions ( see Section 1 . 5 ) . There are three major cytosol - facing regions of GLUT4 : a 24 residue N - terminus , a 43 - residue C - terminus , and a large loop that spans transmembrane regions 6 and 7 of 65 residues in length ( C223 to P287 ; termed G4 - loop ) . Several studies have explored the existence of functionally significant motifs on these endofacial regions . These include two motifs that resemble putative clathrin adaptor binding motifs that are involved in the internalization of the transporter from the cell surface : a N - terminal 5 FQQI 8 motif [ 284 , 638 - 643 ] , and a C - terminal dileucine motif ( 489 LL 490 ) [ 302 , 636 , 641 , 642 , 644 , 645 ] . In addition , these motifs are also involved in proper sorting into insulin - responsive GLUT4 sorting vesicles [ 638 , 639 , 646 ] . The entire C - terminal region of the transporter is essential for proper GLUT4 membrane traffic [ 302 , 642 , 647 ] . Specifically , two acidic clusters , 498 TELEYLGP 505 [ 645 ] and 491 EQE 493 [ 648 ] are required for intracellular membrane sorting of GLUT4 away from transferrin receptor , possibly into a syntaxin 6 / 16 - containing perinuclear compartment [ 645 ] . A 509 PDEND 512 motif is also required for GLUT4 to sort into a perinuclear storage membrane compartment [ 649 ] . A possible phosphorylation site , S488 , confers to GLUT4 the ability to sort away from the transferrin receptor , likely into GLUT4 storage vesicles [ 635 ] , although the S488A mutation was found to have no effect in a recent study [ 650 ] . A motif that partly overlaps with previously described GLUT4 sorting motifs , 500 LEYLGPDED 509 bears homology to the cytoplasmic region of IRAP , a protein with similar insulin - responsive membrane traffic and sorting as GLUT4 [ 651 ] . Interestingly , mutations L500 , L503 and P505 ( all to alanine ) , within this motif , target GLUT4 to large , dispersed membrane compartments devoid of wild - type GLUT4 and abrogate both basal and insulin - stimulated recycling through the PM [ 650 ] . Thus , numerous studies find critical roles of motifs within the C - terminus for proper membrane sorting of GLUT4 , although the observations are not always consistent . However , GLUT4 has a complex sorting itinerary ( see Section 1 . 6 ) , and it is likely that regions outside the C - terminus contribute to it . 110 More recently , attention has turned to the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 6 and 7 ( termed G4 - loop ) , as this region represents the largest intracellular portion of the transporter . Substitution of this portion of GLUT4 with the corresponding region of GLUT1 resulted in loss of GLUT4 intracellular retention and default sorting to the cell surface [ 291 ] . These results point to an important role of G4 - loop for proper intracellular sorting , although GLUT4 - GLUT1 hybrid transporter could be trafficking to the cell surface due to the presence of GLUT1 sorting signals and not loss of GLUT4 sorting signals . Thus , direct examination of the role of G4 - loop in GLUT4 function is warranted . GLUT4 intracellular retention and consequently insulin responsiveness requires the UBX - domain containing protein TUG which binds GLUT4 [ 305 ] . Interestingly , TUG binds to the G4 - loop region of GLUT4 , and siRNA gene silencing of TUG or expression of mutants in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes results in improper intracellular sorting of GLUT4 , lower insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation and decreased GLUT4 protein stability [ 306 ] . These results suggest a role for the interaction of TUG with G4 - loop for regulation of GLUT4 membrane traffic . However , TUG may have additional functions and interactions , and the defects observed upon TUG depletion or expression of TUG mutants could result from TUG interacting with proteins other than GLUT4 . Thus , determining the effect of specific disruption of the G4 - loop - TUG interaction on GLUT4 function remains to be determined . In addition , sequence analysis of G4 - loop reveals a sequence that resembles a p38MAPK interaction sequence between residues 243 and 258 ( Figure 27 ) . The crystal structure of p38MAPK revealed that the kinase binds to substrates such as MEF2A and upstream regulators such as MKK3 by the same site separate from the active site [ 93 ] , and G4 - loop has a sequence similar to p38MAPK substrates and kinases ( Figure 27 ) . In vitro experiments showed that recombinant p38MAPK α interacts with a GST - fusion of G4 - loop , and this interaction decreases upon p38MAPK phosphorylation ( V . Poon and A . Klip , unpublished observation ) . In addition , the p38MAPK substrate PRAK is also capable of interaction with the GST - fusion of G4 - loop ( V . Poon and A . Klip , unpublished observation ) . Although the activity of p38MAPK does not regulate GLUT4 intrinsic activity or insulin - stimulated membrane traffic ( see Chapter 2 ) , it is still possible that the transporter binds p38MAPK and that this interaction , independent of 111 p38MAPK activity , impinges on GLUT4 function . As discussed in Section 2 . 7 , although p38MAPK does not participate in acute insulin action with respect to GLUT4 function , the kinase may have a role in long - term effects of insulin stimulation . Further studies are necessary to establish whether p38MAPK interacts with GLUT4 in cells , within the context of the full length transporter , and whether this interaction has any functional consequence for either protein . Figure 27 . G4 - loop contains a putative p38MAPK - binding motif . Shown in an alignment of GLUT4 residues 243 - 258 ( within G4 - loop ) with homologous sequences from known p38MAPK substrates MEF2A , SAP - 1 and PRAK ( Alignment performed by Vincent Poon ) . In addition to the above possible interactions with putative motifs on G4 - loop , also observed are putative motifs similar to clathrin adaptor binding motifs ( 229 YLYI 232 ) , to class IV WW domain interaction motifs ( 223 - 228 ) , to SH2 - binding motifs ( 229 - 232 ) , to class III PDZ - binding motifs ( 254 - 257 ) and to motifs predicted to be SUMOylated ( 260 - 263 ) . In addition , a predicted phosphorylation site for the kinase Akt , which is required for insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , is found in G4 - loop ( 269 - 275 ) . Thus , G4 - loop appears to contain numerous motifs that could be essential for GLUT4 membrane traffic and insulin responsiveness . The purpose of the work presented in this Chapter is to begin to explore the role of interactors to the G4 - loop region of GLUT4 , such as TUG and p38MAPK . To achieve this , a GFP fusion protein with a region corresponding to the G4 - loop peptide was expressed in L6 myocytes in order to disrupt interactions with the full - length transporter . In addition , the possible interaction of p38MAPK with G4 - loop was examined in cells , in the context of the full length transporter , through co - immunoprecipitation experiments . 112 3 . 2 Methods Cell culture and immunoblotting , were performed as described in Section 2 . 2 .

Construction of the GFP - G4loop cDNA Plasmids encoding rat G4 - loop , G4 - loop p38MAPK binding mutant ( G4 - loop - p38BM ) , and corresponding region from rat GLUT1 , G1 - loop cDNAs fused to an N - terminal His tag were 114 previously generated by Vincent Poon ( V . Poon and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , and termed pGEX - G4 - loop , pGEX - G4 - loop - p38BM and pGEX - G1 - loop as follows : Creation of pGEX - G4 - loop ( V . Poon ) : Rat GLUT4 DNA was used as a template to generate a PCR fragment encoding the large cytoplasmic loop of GLUT4 ( GLUT4 loop ) .

Briefly , 2 μ g of each cDNA was mixed with 4 μ L of Lipofectamine solution for 20 min and added to cells in serum - free α - MEM for 4 h . Cells were washed and incubated in α - MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS for 14 - 16 h . Detection of cell surface or total GLUT4 myc by immunofluorescence microscopy L6 myoblasts were seeded on coverslips and transfected as indicated . On the day of the experiment , cells were serum - deprived for 3 to 5 h and then stimulated as indicated , in serum - free α - MEM at 37C . Cells were washed in ice - cold PBS + , then blocked in ice - cold 5 % goat serum ( GS ) in PBS + for 15 min . Subsequently , surface GLUT4 myc in intact , non - permeabilized L6 cells was labeled with anti - myc antibody ( 2 μ g / mL in PBS + with 5 % GS ) . The cells were washed extensively in ice - cold PBS + to remove excess antibodies , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS + for 30 min at 4C , followed by quenching of the fixative for 10 min in 100 mM glycine in PBS + . Anti - myc antibodies bound to GLUT4 myc at the cell surface were detected by Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibodies . Excess secondary antibodies were removed by extensive washing . Coverslips were then mounted in DAKO on glass slides and fluorescent images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope . Whole cell mounts were scanned along the z - axis and a single composite image ( collapsed XY sum projection ) was generated using LSM5 Image software . Surface GLUT4 myc in each cell was quantified using ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , USA ) . Detection of GLUT4 total cellular GLUT4 and GLUT4compartment morphology L6 myoblasts were seeded on coverslips and transfected as indicated . On the day of the experiment , cells were serum - deprived for 3 to 5 h and then stimulated as indicated , in serum - free α - MEM at 37C . Cells were washed in ice - cold PBS + , and then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS + for 30 min at 4C , followed by quenching of the fixative for 10 min in 117 100 mM glycine in PBS + . Cells were then permeabilized by incubation in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS + for 30 min at 4 C . Cells were then blocked in ice - cold 5 % goat serum ( GS ) in PBS + for 15 min and then total cellular GLUT4 myc was labeled with anti - myc antibody ( 2 μ g / mL in PBS + with 5 % GS ) . The cells were washed extensively in ice - cold PBS + to remove excess antibodies , followed by labelling with Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibodies . Excess secondary antibodies were removed by extensive washing . Coverslips were then mounted in DAKO on glass slides and fluorescent images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope . Whole cell mounts were scanned along the z - axis and a single composite image ( collapsed XY sum projection ) was generated using LSM5 Image software . Total cellular GLUT4 myc in each cell was quantified using ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , USA ) . GLUT4 staining morphology was scored as previously described [ 652 ] ; those with a clear GLUT4 conical projection eminating from the nucleus , spanning < 50 % of the nuclear circumference , were assigned as “cone” , whereas the rest were assigned as a “no - cone” . 3 . 3 GLUT4 interaction with p38MAPK in L6 cells To test whether p38MAPK interacts with GLUT4 in L6 cells within the context of the full - length transporter , it was important to employ a method that was not obstructed by endogenous protein - protein interactions . Importantly , it has been previously shown that the C - terminus of GLUT4 cannot be detected as efficiently in the basal state as upon insulin stimulation in skeletal muscle [ 625 ] and L6 myotubes [ 313 ] . Transporters involved in protein - protein interactions via endofacial motifs may not be recognized by antibodies that recognize endofacial epitopes . As all available GLUT4 antibodies recognize endofacial epitopes , they are not ideal to detect interactions upon GLUT4 immunoprecipitation . L6 cells stably expressing GLUT4 harbouring a myc epitope in the first exofacial loop ( L6 - GLUT4 myc ) represent an ideal system to detect GLUT4 interactors by immunoprecipitating GLUT4 myc via the myc epitope . However , we failed to detect p38MAPK α in GLUT4 myc immunoprecipitates ( Figure 28 ) . 118 Figure 28 . p38MAPK does not co - immunoprecipitate with GLUT4 myc from L6 myotubes . Following serum starvation , L6 - GLUT4 myc cells were stimulated as indicated and subject to “Regular GLUT4 myc IP” . Shown are immunoblots representative of 5 independent experiments , detecting p38MAPK α or GLUT4 myc within immunoprecipitates . n . s . IgG , non - specific IgG antibody ( control ) ; WCL : whole cell lysates . Although the experimental conditions in Figure 28 were mild to promote preservation of protein - protein interactions ( such as the use of C 12 E 8 detergent ) , it is conceiveable that they sufficed to disrupt the interaction of p38MAPK α with GLUT4 ( see 3 . 2 ) . For example , co - precipitation of TUG with GLUT4 requires the presence of the alkylating agent iodoacetamide , and the specific detergents octylglucoside and Triton X - 100 . Given that these conditions may reflect particular structural properties of GLUT4 itself , detection of p38MAPK interaction with GLUT4 may require similar conditions . However , upon immunoprecipitation of GLUT4 myc via the myc - epitope using alkylating conditions ( see 3 . 2 ) , followed by immunoblotting using anti - p38MAPK α antibodies , again p38MAPK was not detected in GLUT4 myc immunoprecipitates ( Figure 29 ) . 119 Figure 29 . p38MAPK does not co - immunoprecipitate with GLUT4 myc from L6 myotubes , determined using the acetylating agent iodoacetamide . Following serum starvation , L6 - GLUT4 myc or L6 - WT ( control ) cells were stimulated as indicated and subject to “ GLUT4 myc IP with alkylating agent iodoacetimide” . Shown are immunoblots representative of 5 independent experiments , detecting p38MAPK α or GLUT4 myc within immunoprecipitates . WCL : whole cell lysates . The interactions of kinases with their substrates are generally difficult to determine by traditional means [ 653 ] , perhaps due to relatively high ‘off rates” of binding . Although p38MAPK likely does not phosphorylate GLUT4 , the interaction of GLUT4 with the kinase are likely similar to those between p38MAPK and MEF2A , since p38MAPK binds GLUT4 in vitro via a motif resembling the one binding substrates . Therefore , the interaction of p38MAPK and GLUT4 may be subject to high rates of dissociation that could result in loss of p38MAPK from GLUT4 immunoprecipitates during the washing stages of the immunoprecipitation experiment ( see 3 . 2 ) . In order to address this possibility , L6 myotubes were treated with dithio - bis - succinimidyl propionate ( DSP ) , an amine - specific covalent cross - linker , to stabilize highly transient protein - protein interactions . G4 - loop and p38MAPK contain 6 and 16 lysine residues , respectively , indicating that any interaction between p38MAPK and GLUT4 is highly likely to be preserved by this covalent cross - linking . However , even under these conditions , p38MAPK was again not detected by immunoblotting of GLUT4 myc immunoprecipitates with anti - p38MAPK α antibodies ( Figure 30 ) . 120 Figure 30 . p38MAPK does not co - immunorecipitate with GLUT4 myc from L6 myotubes following treatment with the cross - linker DSP . Following serum starvation , L6 - GLUT4 myc or L6 - WT ( control ) cells were stimulated as indicated and cross - linking with 1 mM DSP for 20 min , as indicated , and subject to “ GLUT4myc IP following protein - protein cross - linking ” . Shown are immunoblots representative of 5 independent experiments , detecting p38MAPK α or GLUT4 myc within immunoprecipitates . WCL : whole cell lysates . Taken together , these observations suggest that p38MAPK does not bind to GLUT4 myc in L6 myotubes . This could result from two possibilities : that the G4 - loop found within full length GLUT4 is conformationally different from that within the GST - G4 - loop fusion protein used for in vitro studies and / or that p38MAPK only interacts with G4 - loop in vitro but not within L6 cells . The ability of TUG to interact with both full - length GLUT4 as well as GST - G4 - loop ( X . Huang and A . Klip , unpublished observations and [ 306 ] ) suggests that GST - G4 - loop is in fact structurally similar to the corresponding region of full length GLUT4 . Thus , the most likely explanation of the lack of interaction detected between GLUT4 myc and p38MAPK is that p38MAPK only interacts with G4 - loop in vitro but not in the L6 myocytes . However , p38MAPK may still be present at very low levels in GLUT4 myc immunoprecipitates , as the detection limit of an immunoblots , is typically in the nanogram range [ 654 ] . Additional methods to detect p38MAPK within GLUT4 myc immunoprecipitates , such as LUMIER , can be used to increase sensitivity . This technique can detect transient kinase - substrate interactions [ 653 ] . Candidate proteins for co - precipitation are fused to luciferase from Renilla reniformis ( sea pansy ) or Photinus pyralis ( American firefly ) , that bioluminesces when provided with their substrates luciferin ( Stragagene , La Jolla , CA ) or colenterazine ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , respectively . Following precipitation of one protein , the presence of its binding partner is 121 detected by luciferase bioluminescence . As few as 10 - 20 moles of luciferase can be detected by this method . Alternatively , GLUT4 interaction with p38MAPK might be detectable using methods that do not rely on prior isolation of GLUT4 myc , such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . This technique involves detection of energy transfer between appropriate fluorophores covalently attached to each of two candidate binding partners , so long as the fluorophores are situated within approximately 10 nM of each other , indicative of close contact of the two proteins ( reviewed by [ 655 ] ) . FRET is highly sensitive to the orientation of acceptor and donor fluorophores , and care must be given to ensure that fusion proteins used to detect FRET between GLUT4 and p38MAPK are compatible with this structural requirement . In addition , fusion of fluorophores or luciferase to either p38MAPK or GLUT4 can disrupt endogenous interactions . At present , without structural information available for GLUT4 , it seems impractical to consider FRET or LUMIER to detect this interaction as negative results would be difficult to interpret . The interaction of GLUT4 with p38MAPK and other possible binding proteins may be more effectively inferred by functionally interfering with these interactions . 3 . 4 Expression of GFP - GLUT4 - loop in L6 myocytes A fusion protein of G4 - loop with GFP was constructed ( GFP - G4 - loop , see 3 . 2 ) and expressed in L6 myoblasts . Cells expressing GFP - G4loop had a significantly higher levels ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 9 , and Figure 31 ) of cell surface GLUT4 myc compared to cells expressing only GFP in the basal state ( 1 . 36 ± 0 . 09 and 1 . 05 ± 0 . 05 fold , respectively , relative to basal untransfected cells ) and upon insulin - stimulation ( 2 . 79 ± 0 . 29 and 2 . 21 ± 0 . 31 fold respectively , relative to basal untransfected cells ) . As a result , the fold increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc stimulated by insulin was similar in cells expressing GFP - G4loop or GFP alone ( 2 . 08 ± 0 . 20 and 2 . 04 ± 0 . 21 fold , relative to basal cells expressing GFP - G4loop and GFP alone , respectively ) . 122 Figure 31 . Expression of GFP - G4loop increases both basal and insulin - stimulated cell surface GLUT4 myc in L6 myoblasts . L6 - GLUT4 myc myoblasts were transfected with cDNA encoding either GFP - G4loop ( WT ) or GFP only . Following serum starvation , cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin or left unstimulated ( basal ) , as indicated , followed by measurement of cell surface GLUT4 myc by immunofluorescence microscopy . Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence , as indicated . A . Shown are stacked projections of z - plane images obtained by confocal microscopy of GLUT4 myc at the cell surface and GFP fluorescence , as indicated . Images are representative of at least 8 independent experiments . Scale bar 10 μ m . B . Shown is a graph of mean ± SE from 8 independent experiments . * and # , p < 0 . 05 , relative to GFP - expressing basal and insulin - stimulated cells , respectively . In order to determine if the increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc in the basal state was due to disruption of full - length - GLUT4 myc binding to p38MAPK , mutations were introduced into 123 GFP - G4loop ( K247E and R249D ) . In vitro , these mutations in GST - fusion of G4 - loop abolish binding of p38MAPK ( V . Poon and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) . Another mutation , L273N , in GFP - G4loop is expected to prevent interaction with TUG , based on the similarity of TUG to another UBX - domain containing protein , FAF1 ( Fas - associated factor 1 ) , that cannot interact with Fas following an I246N mutation in a similar motif on Fas ( 236 - EAKKFARENNI - 246 in Fas and 263 - EKRKLERERPL - 273 in GLUT4 ) [ 305 ] . Neitehr the K247E , R249D nor L273N mutations affect the ability of GFP - G4loop to cause redistribution of GLUT4 myc to the cell surface upon overexpression in L6 myoblasts ( 1 . 30 ± 0 . 21 and 1 . 28 ± 0 . 02 – fold cell surface GLUT4 myc , respectively , and Figure 32 ) . However , expression of a GFP fusion protein of the corresponding cytoplasmic loop between TM6 and 7 from GLUT1 ( G1 - loop ) did not increase cell surface GLUT4 myc when overexpressed in L6 myoblasts ( 1 . 04 ± 0 . 05 - fold , and Figure 32 ) . These results suggest that a motif on G4 - loop of GLUT4 , not found in GLUT1 , facilitates basal retention of GLUT4 myc in L6 cells but is not involved in insulin responsiveness of GLUT4 translocation ( Figure 31 ) . Figure 32 . Mutation of putative p38MAPK binding region or TUG binding region on GFP - G4loop does not affect GFP - G4loop expression - mediated increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc . L6 - GLUT4 myc myoblasts were transfected with cDNA encoding either GFP - G4loop ( WT ) , GFP - G4loop p38 binding mutant , GFP - G4loop TUG binding mutant or GFP only . Following serum starvation , cell surface GLUT4 myc was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy . Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence . Shown is a graph of mean cell surface GLUT4myc ± SE from 3 - 9 independent experiments . * , p < 0 . 05 , relative to GFP - expressing cells . 124 The increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc upon expression of GFP - G4 - loop could potentially be due to an increase in total cellular GLUT4 myc protein content , due to a reduction in GLUT4 myc degradation . Decreased GLUT4 degradation is an important consideration as this occurs following siRNA gene silencing of TUG [ 306 ] . It is unlikely that the increase in surface GLUT4 myc would be due a higher rate of transcription of the transporter since GLUT4 myc is expressed from a heterologous promoter in L6 - GLUT4 myc cells . Following permeabilization , similar levels of total cellular GLUT4 myc were detected in L6 myoblasts expressing either GFP - G4 - loop WT or GFP - G4 - loop p38 binding mutant ( 1 . 06 ± 0 . 01 and 0 . 96 ± 0 . 02 - fold , respectively ) relative to cells expressing GFP alone ( Figure 33 ) . These results show that this increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc is not due to an increase in GLUT4 myc protein within L6 - GLUT4 myc cells , but instead due to a specific redistribution of GLUT4 myc to the cell surface . Figure 33 . Expression of GFP - G4 - loop WT or p38 α binding mutant does not affect total cellular GLUT4 myc in L6 myoblasts . L6 - GLUT4 myc myoblasts were transfected with cDNA encoding either GFP - G4loop ( WT ) , GFP - G4loop p38 binding mutant , or GFP only . Following serum starvation , total cellular GLUT4 myc ( in permeabilized cells ) was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy . Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence . Shown is a graph of mean ± SE from 3 independent experiments . 125 Overall , these data suggest that the increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc observed upon expression of GFP - G4 - loop is due to an alteration of GLUT4 membrane traffic and sorting . Since the stimulation of GLUT4 myc translocation by insulin is not affected by expression of GFP - G4 - loop , the traffic of GLUT4 into the insulin - sensitive GLUT4 storage compartment ( see Section 1 . 6 ) is unlikely to be affected . Instead , the increase in GLUT4 myc at the cell surface is likely due to a change of distribution of GLUT4 myc within the endosomal recycling system to the cell surface at the expense of intracellular GLUT4 myc . Insulin stimulation elicits a redistribution of the perinuclear GLUT4 myc compartment from a mostly cone - shape ( 60 - 70 % cone morphology ) to concentrical shape ( 30 - 40 % cone morphology ) that envelopes the nucleus ( see Section 3 . 2 ) , likely the consequence of insulin - stimulated intracellular GLUT4 membrane traffic [ 652 ] . Upon insulin stimulation , GLUT4 increases at the cell surface as a consequence of increased PM docking and fusion , but also as a result of accelerated intracellular membrane traffic ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . Expression of GFP - G4loop did not alter the transition from a mostly cone - like morphology to a predominantly concentrical perinuclear distribution evoked by insulin ( Figure 34 ) . In this figure , cells designated as “cone - like” as indicated with an arrow in each panel . Therefore , expression of GFP - G4 - loop in L6 myoblasts weakens its intracellular retention of GLUT4 , by acting at a step beyond the insulin - targeted perinuclear step . 126 127 Figure 34 . Insulin - stimulated changes in GLUT4 myc staining morphology are similar in cells expressing GFP - G4 - loop or GFP alone . L6 - GLUT4 myc myoblasts were transfected with cDNA encoding either GFP - G4loop ( WT ) , GFP - G4loop p38 binding mutant , or GFP only . Following serum starvation , total cellular GLUT4 was detected by immunofluorescence and GLUT4 staining morphology in each cell was determined to be either cone - like or not ( non - cone ) , as indicated , and expressed as a percentage of cells . Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence . A . Shown are single z - plane images obtained by confocal microscopy of total cellular GLUT4 myc and GFP fluorescence , as indicated . Images are representative of 3 independent experiments . Scale bar 10 μ m . Yellow arrowheads indicate cells designated as “cone - like” . B . Shown is a graph of mean ± SE from 3 independent experiments . In summary , expression of GFP - G4 - loop in L6 myoblasts causes a redistribution of full - length GLUT4 myc to the cell surface . This redistribution is unlikely to arise from altered binding of p38MAPK or TUG to GLUT4 myc , and may instead result from perturbation of the interaction of the transporter with a yet unidentified protein . 128 3 . 5 Discussion and conclusions The results obtained here suggest that although p38MAPK can bind to a cytosolic portion of GLUT4 ( G4 - loop ) in vitro , it does not appear to bind full - length GLUT4 in cells . Even though protein cross - linking failed to support such a binding ( Figure 30 ) , it is plausible that the interaction of GLUT4 with p38MAPK in cells is very transient ( ie . with a very high off rate ) . While possible , this is unlikely since interaction of p38MAPK with GST - G4 - loop in vitro could be identified by GST pulldown assays that involve similar purification steps as an immunoprecipitation from cells . We cannot rule out that the conformation of GLUT4 is altered upon cell lysis or during purification , thereby disrupting possible interactions with other proteins . However , we also employed alkylating agents that may stabilize GLUT4 and its binding partners [ 305 ] together with the mild non - ionic detergent octylglucoside , optimal for purification of membrane proteins in their native state [ 305 ] . Under these conditions , TUG co - immunoprecipitates with GLUT4 , yet p38MAPK fails to do so ( Figure 29 ) . Thus , it seems most likely that p38MAPK and full - length GLUT4 do not interact within cells . Since MAPKs are known to have many adaptors , such as TAB1 [ 158 ] , it is possible that through interaction with these adaptors p38MAPK is sequestered away from GLUT4 when inside cells , reflecting the fact that not all motifs that are capable of interacting in vitro do so within cells . Detection of protein interaction motifs without prior protein isolation The abovementioned problems with methods that involve isolation and purification of GLUT4 suggest that other methods to detect protein - protein interactions are required under some circumstances . Introduction of short peptides into cells that disrupt protein - protein interactions represents an attractive strategy . This strategy can also be used to examine possible unidentified motifs within a region of a protein , if this region is able to adopt the conformation of the corresponding region of the full - length protein . G4 - loop , when made as part of a GST - fusion protein , retains the ability of the full - length GLUT4 to bind TUG ( X . Huang and A . Klip , 129 unpublished observations ) and hexokinase II ( H . Zaid and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) in vitro . These observations strongly suggest that G4 - loop , when expressed as part of either a GST or GFP fusion protein , retains its proper conformation . Thus , expression of GFP - G4 - loop represents a viable strategy to examine the contributions of motifs within G4 - loop to the traffic of full - length GLUT4 . Motif within G4 - loop mediates GLUT4 retention during basal endosomal membrane recycling The increase in cell surface GLUT4 observed upon overexpression of GFP - G4 - loop could result from lower endocytosis , or in higher exocytosis of the transporter . In preliminary experiments , it appears that GFP - G4loop does not alter the rate of GLUT4 internalization ( see Section 6 . 2 ) . Thus , GFP - G4 - loop likely increases the cell surface content of full - length GLUT4 likely by increasing its rate of basal , constiuitive exocytosis . GLUT4 resides intracellularly within two intracellular membrane compartments , identified largely on the basis of other proteins present within each membrane pool and responsiveness of each pool to insulin stimulation ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . Since full insulin - stimulated GLUT4 myc translocation was retained in cells expressing GFP - G4 - loop , the steady - state dynamic partitioning of GLUT4 myc to the insulin - responsive GSVs was likely unaffected . Thus , it appears that GLUT4 myc may be relocalizing to the cell surface from within the general recycling endocytic membrane pool of GLUT4 upon expression of GFP - G4 - loop . Consistent with this interpretation , the motifs thus far shown to be essential for sorting GLUT4 into the GSV compartment are predominantly located on the C - terminus ( see Section 3 . 1 ) . These results argue that in addition to a retention mechanism for GLUT4 within the specialized GLUT4 storage pool , a retention mechanism also exists for GLUT4 within the recycling endosomal membrane pool . Consistent with this interpretation , insulin also increases recycling of the transferrin receptor ( a resident of the recycling endosome ) in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , albeit to lesser degree than GLUT4 [ 281 ] . We conclude that proteins within the general endosomal recycling membranes exhibit some form of intracellular retention in the basal 130 state , and it seems likely that expression of GFP - G4 - loop disrupts GLUT4 sorting or retention within this membrane pool . This retention of GLUT4 within the endosomal membranes could be due to static retention , for example binding to a rigid structure such as the cytoskeleton , or a dynamic retention , as has been described for GLUT4 within the specialized GLUT4 storage compartment ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . Candidate proteins involved in GLUT4 retention during basal endosomal recycling The increase in cell surface GLUT4 observed in cells overexpressing GFP - G4loop likely results from the sequestration of some binding partner away from full length GLUT4 . Several binding proteins have been described for GLUT4 and thus provide interesting candidates for this intracellular endosomal retention of GLUT4 . Three proteins , of 28 , 70 and 85 kDa were shown to bind to GLUT4 , although these proteins were never identified [ 656 ] . Also , a 70 kDa protein , termed glucose transporter - binding protein of 70 kDa ( GTB70 ) was identified as binding to GLUT4 and to G4loop by GST pull - down [ 657 ] . Although the function of this protein was not identified [ 657 ] , the binding to G4 - loop suggest that this region does indeed bind to cytosolic proteins . In addition these , many proteins interacting with GLUT4 have been identified and specific roles have been proposed for these interactions in GLUT4 membrane traffic ( Table 6 ) . Therefore , each of these proposed interactors should be considered as a candidate for interaction disrupted by expression of GFP - G4 - loop . However , only disruption of TUG results in similar effects on GLUT4 membrane traffic , namely an increase in both basal and insulin - stimulated cell surface GLUT4 . 131 GLUT4 interactor Effect of disruption Cell type Reference TUG Decreased intracellular GLUT4 retention , increased GLUT4 degradation 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 306 ] mUbc9 Decreased GLUT4 SUMOylation , stability L6 myocytes [ 602 ] Daxx Not determined 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 600 ] Myosin - derived peptide C109 Reduced basal and insulin - stimulated cell surface GLUT4 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 658 ] Aldolase Decreased insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , binding to actin 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 659 ] Actinin 4 Decreased insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , binding to actin L6 myoblasts [ 626 ] sortilin Decreased intracellular GLUT4 retention , increased GLUT4 degradation 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 299 ] Table 6 . Identified GLUT4 interacting proteins . Listed are proteins that interact with GLUT4 , along with the effect of disruption of this interaction on GLUT4 membrane traffic and the cell type studied . The interaction of GLUT4 with TUG was proposed to retain GLUT4 intracellularly within a specialized GLUT4 storage vesicles ( GSV ) in the basal state [ 305 , 306 ] . Insulin stimulation causes a dissociation of TUG from GLUT4 , and this was proposed to facilitate GLUT4 exocytosis [ 305 ] . Accordingly , disruption of GLUT4 interaction with TUG by siRNA gene silencing of TUG in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes redistributed GLUT4 to the cell surface in the basal state , and insulin was able to further cause a 2 - fold increase in GLUT4 translocation [ 306 ] . This result is similar to that obtained by expression of GFP - G4 - loop in L6 myoblasts . However , several aspects of depletion of TUG differ from the phenomenon observed upon expression of GFP - G4 - loop . First , siRNA to TUG resulted in a greatly reduced rate of GLUT4 degradation [ 306 ] , and in turn , an increase in total cellular GLUT4 , whereas expression of GFP - G4 - loop did not alter GLUT4 expression ( Figure 33 ) . Second , mutation of GFP - G4loop ( L273N ) is expected to prevent interaction with TUG , based on the similarity of TUG to another UBX - domain containing protein , FAF1 ( Fas - associated factor 1 ) [ 305 ] ; however , this mutant behaved similarly 132 to wt - GFP - G4loop . Thus , GFP - G4loop likely does not increase basal and insulin - stimulated cell surface GLUT4 by disrupting an interaction with TUG . It is possible that GFP - G4loop was not expressed to sufficient levels to saturate the binding to TUG , thereby not preventing TUG from binding full - length GLUT4 . Alternatively , it is possible that TUG has different functions in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 306 ] than in L6 myocytes observed in this study . As described earlier , the SUMO - conjugating enzyme mUbc9 interacts with GLUT4 , resulting in SUMOylation of GLUT4 , and regulation of GLUT4 protein stability [ 602 ] . Ubc9 interact with the protein Daxx , which interacts with the GLUT4 C - terminus [ 600 ] . Again , as is the case for the interaction of GLUT4 with TUG , expression of GFP - G4 - loop is unlikely to disrupt normal GLUT4 traffic as a result of disruption of interaction with Daxx or Ubc9 , as there was no change in total cellular GLUT4 observed ( Figure 33 ) that would be expected from altered GLUT4 protein stability . A myosin - derived peptide , C109 , binds to the C - terminus of GLUT4 and reduces the cell surface level of GLUT4 and 3 - O - methylglucose uptake in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 658 ] . Since GFP - G4loop increased cell surface GLUT4 ( Figure 31 ) , it is unlikely that this resulted from disruption of binding to the transporter to myosin . However , recent work suggests that myosin Vb ( S . Ihikura and A . Klip , submitted ) and myosin 1c [ 660 , 661 ] participate in insulin - dependent GLUT4 traffic , warranting further study of how myosin may interact with GLUT4 or GLUT4 vesicles . GLUT4 interacts with several proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism , such as L - 3 - hydroxyacyl - CoA dehydrogenase [ 659 ] , which is involved in protein acylation . In addition , fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphosphate aldolase , a glycolytic enzyme , has been proposed to link GLUT4 to the actin cytoskeleton [ 662 ] . However , the disruption of GLUT4 interaction with aldolase through microinjection of aldolase - specific antibodies or inhibitors of aldolase resulted in a decrease in insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis . Hence , the disruption of GLUT4 interactions by expression of GFP - G4loop likely did not result from disruption of interaction with aldolase , given the higher cell surface GLUT4 observed ( Figure 31 ) . Furthermore , another glycolytic enzyme , hexokinase II , was identified as a GLUT4 interacting protein by mass spectrometry , and insulin diminished this interaction [ 626 ] . However , siRNA gene silencing of 133 hexokinase II in L6 myocytes had no effect on basal or insulin - stimulated GLUT4 membrane traffic ( H . Zaid and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) . Although the presence of several metabolic enzymes binding to GLUT4 suggests some interesting possibilities , such as the existence of a metabolic complex to channel glucose metabolites through processes such as glycolysis , it does not appear that disruption of GLUT4 binding to these proteins by GFP - G4loop expression results in the enhanced PM GLUT4 traffic observed here ( Figure 31 ) . Another protein proposed to bind to GLUT4 is actinin - 4 , an actin filament cross - linking protein , and this interaction is increased by insulin [ 626 ] . Interestingly , actinin - 4 , as part of the CART complex , is proposed to mediate recycling of the transferrin receptor within endosomal membranes [ 663 ] . This finding makes the association of GLUT4 with actinin - 4 an interesting candidate for the interaction disrupted by GFP - G4 - loop . However , silencing the expression of actinin - 4 in L6 myotubes reduced insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation without affecting basal cell surface GLUT4 ( I . Talior and A . Klip , submitted ) , suggesting that GFP - G4 - loop does not act on GLUT4 membrane traffic by disrupting its interaction with actinin - 4 . It has been reported that sortilin binds GLUT4 , mediating the transporter’s sorting into the GSVs in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 299 ] , although this scenario has been deemed unlikely [ 297 ] . In any case , it appears unlikely that GFP - G4 - loop affects GLUT4 membrane traffic by disruption of a putative interaction with sortilin , as disruption of sortilin - GLUT4 interaction would have reduced the magnitude of insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation . Moreover , sortilin is proposed to interact with GLUT4 and IRAP on the luminal side of intracellular vesicles [ 300 ] , and therefore expression of GFP - G4 - loop , which is expected to compete with motifs present on the cytosolic face of full - length GLUT4 for interacting partners , would not be expected to disrupt this interaction . Moreover , neither siRNA - mediated gene silencing nor overexpression of sortilin in L6 myoblasts had any effect on basal or insulin - stimulated cell surface GLUT4 ( S . Ishikura and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , suggesting that sortilin may not play the same role in muscle cells as it does in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 299 ] . Recently , synapsin IIb , involved in exocytosis of a pool of synaptic vesicles near the active site of neurons , when mutated to prevent phosphorylation ( S10A ) and expressed in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes elevated basal and insulin cell surface GLUT4 by 4 - and 2 - fold , respectively 134 [ 664 ] . This phenomenon was without effect on recycling of transferrin receptor [ 664 ] . Thus , disruption of phosphorylation of synapsin IIb achieves a similar effect on GLUT4 membrane traffic as expression of GFP - G4 - loop , namely increased basal cell surface GLUT4 , while conserving insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis . This leads to the hypothesis that synapsin IIb may be part of a complex that binds GFP - G4 - loop in order to mediate retention of GLUT4 within the endosomal recycling system . Examination of proteins binding to a GST fusion protein of G4 - loop could reveal if synapsin IIb can directly bind to this region of GLUT4 . In summary , the work presented in this chapter , suggests that , consistent with the lack of a role of p38MAPK activity in GLUT4 - mediated glucose transport activity ( see Chapter 2 ) , p38MAPK does not bind to GLUT4 in L6 myocytes . However , through overexpression of GFP - G4loop , the existence of a motif on G4 - loop that likely mediates GLUT4 retention in the basal state within the general recycling endosomes without affecting the ability of GLUT4 to populate the insulin - regulated GLUT4 storage compartment was identified . This motif appears to act independently of previously identified GLUT4 binding partners , thus possibly revealing a novel aspect of GLUT4 membrane traffic . 135 Chapter 4 4 Fish GLUT4 exhihits low intracellular retention and insulin response Part of the work described in this Chapter was previously published within ( as indicated ) : Diaz M , Antonescu CN , Capilla E , Klip A and Planas JV . Fish glucose transporter ( GLUT ) - 4 differs from rat GLUT4 in its traffic characteristics but can translocate to the cell surface in response to insulin in skeletal muscle cells . Endocrinology 2007 148 : 5248 - 57 All results presented in this Chapter are from experiments performed by Costin N .

Antonescu and Figure 44 , performed by Monica Diaz and Josep Planas . 136 4 . 1 Introduction Insulin is a circulating hormone that is conserved in many distantly related organisms ( reviewed by [ 665 ] ) . In mammals , insulin has a well described role to regulate peripheral metabolism , including clearing glucose from the blood following a meal by increasing the rate of glucose uptake through GLUT4 into muscle and adipocytes , as well as halting hepatic glucose production ( see Section 1 . 1 ) . However , insulin has many other physiological functions , including mitogenesis and differentiation during development , neuroendocrine signaling that controls cognition , appetite and energy expenditure and regulation of lifespan ( reviewed by [ 665 ] . In species distantly related to mammals , such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabitis elegans , the role of insulin in the CNS in regulating lipid and carbohydrate intake and metabolism is well established , but the role of insulin in carbohydrate storage and metabolism through direct action on peripheral tissues has not been studied [ 665 ] . The action of insulin to signal to peripheral tissues to clear glucose from the blood may thus be a relatively recent evolutionary phenomenon . Interestingly , vertebrate species evolutionarily closer to mammals , such as fish , do have insulin - stimulated glucose clearance from the blood , although this process is less efficient , as exhibited by a well - characterized glucose intolerance in fish compared to mammals [ 666 , 667 ] . This could be due to insulin action or differences in GLUT4 . If the latter , fish GLUT4 could offer interesting clues on how GLUT4 is sorted to insulin - sensitive compartments . GLUT4 from two different fish species was recently cloned ( see Figure 35 ) . In this Chapter we explored the behavior of brown trout GLUT4 stably expressed in L6 skeletal muscle cells ( of rat origin ) in order to investigate how the transporter behaves compared to mammalian GLUT4 , in the same cellular environment . As a preamble to this study , the sequence of all GLUT4 orthologues identified to date were examined for their similarity and identity and a phylogenetic tree was generated ( Figure 35 ) . Note that many GLUT isoforms exist in mammals ( see Section 1 . 5 ) , and many GLUTs are also present in evolutionarily distant organisms including invertebrates . Hence , care was taken to 137 determine that the GLUT homologues used for this analysis were in fact orthologues of GLUT4 and not paralogues ( e . g . , orthologues of mammalian GLUT1 ) . Designation of each candidate as a GLUT4 orthologues is determined by high levels of adipose - and muscle - specific expression and responsiveness to insulin . Phylogenic comparison of these transporters to GLUT1 orthologues identifies clear lengthy evolutionary separation of all GLUT4 branch end - points from those of those corresponding to GLUT1 , indicating that all GLUT4 orthologues examined are more related to each other than to GLUT1 from any species ( Figure 35 ) . Interestingly , GLUT4 from three species of fish ( Oncorhynchus kisutch , Coho salmon ; Salmo trutta , brown trout ; and Gadus morhua , Atlantic cod ) represent an evolutionary node that is the most distant from mammalian GLUT4 orthologues , yet distinct from all GLUT1 orthologues , including those from fish ( Figure 35 ) . Thus , GLUT4 from brown trout ( bt - GLUT4 ) was taken as representative of this distantly related family of GLUT4 orthologues . 138 Figure 35 . Fish - GLUT4 is most distantly known orthologue of mammalian GLUT4 that remains distinct from GLUT1 . Shown is a phylogram generated by ClustalW . Sequences used for comparison are as follows ( common species name , accession numbers ) , GLUT4 : Homo sapiens ( human , P14672 ) , Pan troglodytes ( chimpanzee ; XP _ 001169794 ) , Macaca mulatta ( monkey , XP _ 001107391 ) , Bos taurus ( bovine ; Q27994 ) , Oryctolagus cuniculus ( European rabbit ; NP _ 001082782 ) , Equus caballus ( domesticated horse ; NP _ 001075335 ) , Mus musculus ( house mouse ; NP _ 033230 ) , Canis familiaris ( domesticated dog ; XP _ 536618 ) , Rattus norvegicus ( rat ; NP _ 036883 ) , Felis catus ( house cat ; ABG01985 ) , Monodelphis domestica ( gray short - tailed opossum ; XP _ 001365256 ) , Suncus murinus ( Asian house shrew ; BAF02515 ) , Oncorhynchus kisutch ( Coho salmon ; AAM22227 ) , Salmo trutta ( brown trout ; AAG12191 ) , Gadus morhua ( Atlantic cod ; AAZ15731 ) , GLUT1 : Xenopus laevis ( frog ; NP _ 001085607 ) , Homo sapiens ( AAI21805 ) , Rattus norvegicus ( NP _ 620182 ) , Bos taurus ( NP _ 777027 ) , Mus musculus ( NP _ 035530 ) , Oryctolagus cuniculus ( European rabbit , NP _ 001099157 ) , Gallus gallus ( chicken , NP _ 990540 ) , Gadus morhua ( AAS17880 ) , Oncorhynchus mykiss ( rainbow trout , AAF75681 ) , Cyprinus carpio ( common carp , AAF75683 ) , Danio rerio ( zebrafish , NP _ 001034897 ) . The amino acid sequence of rat - GLUT4 and bt - GLUT4 were compared for sequence similarity and identity ( Figure 36 ) . While certain regions exhibit high levels of difference , such as the cytoplasmic N - and C - termini , others such as the transmembrane segments , are 139 remarkably conserved , suggesting a conserved mechanism of catalysis ( see Section 1 . 5 ) . Interestingly , the region corresponding to G4 - loop ( see Chapter 3 ) is similar in both rat and fish - GLUT4 , with the exception of 2 regions of unknown function ( 238 NLEGP 238 and 279 GSR 282 ) . Aside from these , other regions that are involved in sorting of mammalian GLUT4 within cellular membranes are different between fish and rat transporters . The C - terminus , which contains motifs important for targeting GLUT4 to insulin - regulated GLUT4 storage vesicles ( GSVs ) contains regions which are not conserved in bt - GLUT4 , such as 489 LL 490 [ 646 ] , 491 EQE 493 [ 648 ] and S488 [ 635 ] ( see Section 3 . 1 ) . Interestingly , other C - terminal motifs also proposed to determine GLUT4 sorting to the GSVs , 98 TELEYLGP 505 [ 645 ] , 509 PDEND 512 [ 649 ] , 500 LEYLGPDED 509 [ 650 ] are conserved between mammalian and fish GLUT4 . Moreover , the di - leucine motif 489 LL 490 also functions in GLUT4 endocytosis [ 302 , 636 , 641 , 642 , 644 , 645 ] and is completely absent in the fish , whereas the N - terminal 5 FQQI 8 endocytic motif is only partly conserved [ 284 , 638 - 643 ] ; both target mammalian GLUT4 for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . The purpose of the work presented in this Chapter is to examine whether GLUT4 from brown trout contains within itself any differences in membrane traffic and sorting that could result different responsiveness to insulin compared to mammalian GLUT4 . To this end , bt - GLUT4 was engineered to contain a myc - epitope in its first exofacial loop and used to create an L6 cell line that stably expressed this myc - tagged bt - GLUT4 ( L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc ) , in a manner analogous to L6 - rat - GLUT4 myc . This L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc cell line allows examination of bt - GLUT4 membrane traffic in the same cellular background as rat - GLUT4 myc ( L6 myocytes ) . Thus , any differences observed in the membrane traffic of these two transporters are due to differences between the transporters themselves and likely reflect evolutionary changes in GLUT4 membrane traffic between fish and mammals . 140 Figure 36 .

Creation of L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc stable cell lines Creation of cDNA construct for bt - GLUT4myc ( M . Diaz and J . Planas ) . The cDNA sequence of human c - myc epitope ( 5 ' - GCA GAG GAG CAA AAG CTT ATT TCT GAA GAG GAC TTG CTT AAG - 3 ' ) was introduced into the cDNA coding sequence of bt GLUT4 ( AF247395 ) , between Gly58 and Glu59 , in the region corresponding to the first extracellular loop of bt GLUT4 protein ( btGLUT4 myc ) . Finally bt GLUT4 myc was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCXN2 . 142 Creation of stable L6 - GLUT4myc cell lines . Cell lines stably transfected with pCXN2 - bt - GLUT4 myc were generated as described for MCK - DN - p38MAPK cell lines ( see Section 2 . 2 ) and similarly scored for expression of bt - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 37 ) and ability to differentiate properly into multinucleated myotubes ( data not shown ) . Determination of percentage of GLUT4 on the cell surface Cell surface GLUT4 was labelled and processed to the detection of bound HRP by OPD assay , as described for detection of cell surface GLUT4 myc ( Section 2 . 2 ) . The total cellular amount of GLUT4 myc was determined in a parallel set of cell samples that were first washed 3 X in ice - cold PBS + , fixed in 4 % in PBS + for 30 min , quenched in 100 mM glycine in PBS + for 10 min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 in PBS + for 30 min , all at 4C and then processed to detect the myc epitope as for detection of cell surface GLUT4 described in Section 2 . 2 . Each condition was measured in triplicate . The percentage of GLUT4 at the cell surface in each condition was determined by ( ABS surface - GLUT4 / ABS total - GLUT4 ) x 100 % . GLUT4 myc endocytosis assay L6 myoblasts were serum deprived for 3 – 5 h and then washed in ice - cold PBS + . To label cell surface GLUT4 myc in intact L6 myoblasts , cells were blocked in 5 % GS in PBS + for 15 min and then incubated with α - myc antibody solution ( 1 . 0 μ g / ml in PBS + with 5 % GS ) for 1 h at 4C . The cells were then washed extensively in ice - cold PBS + , twice in 37 C PBS + ( rewarming stage ) , and subsequently returned to 37 C α - MEM at 5 % CO 2 for 0 , 2 , 5 , or 10 min , as indicated ( internalization stage ) . After internalization of surface proteins , L6 cells were rapidly washed in ice - cold PBS + to again arrest membrane traffic , fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS + for 10 min , and quenched by 100 mm glycine in PBS + for 10 min , all at 4 C . GLUT4 - bound anti - myc antibodies remaining at the cell surface were probed by HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection of bound HRP by OPD assay , as described for detection of cell surface GLUT4 myc ( Section 2 . 2 ) . Each condition was measured in triplicate . The percentage of GLUT4 recycling through the cell surface in each condition and timepoint was determined by ( ABS t = 2 , 5 , or 10 min internalization / ABS t = 0 min internalization ) . 143 GLUT4 myc recycling assay L6 myoblasts were serum deprived for 3 h and then incubated with 1 . 0 μ g / ml α - myc antibody ( in α - MEM ) for 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 , or 400 min at 37 C to label the GLUT4 recycling through the plasma membrane ( PM ) during the indicated time . Subsequently , L6 myoblasts were placed on ice to arrest membrane traffic and extensively washed in ice - cold PBS + to remove excess antibodies . Cells were then fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS + for 30 min , followed by quenching of the fixative in 100 mm glycine in PBS + for 10 min , all at 4 C . After blocking in 5 % GS in PBS + for 15 min , GLUT4 - bound anti - myc antibodies were probed by HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection of bound HRP by OPD assay , as described for detection of cell surface GLUT4 myc described in Section 2 . 2 ) . The total cellular amount of GLUT4 myc was determined in a parallel set of cell samples that were first washed 3 X in ice - cold PBS + , fixed in 4 % in PBS + for 30 min , quenched in 100 mM glycine in PBS + for 10 min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 in PBS + , all at 4C and then processed to detect the myc epitope as for detection of cell surface GLUT4 described in Section 2 . 2 . Each condition was measured in triplicate . The percentage of GLUT4 recycling through the cell surface in each condition and timepoint was determined by ( ABS recyling - GLUT4 / ABS total - GLUT4 ) . cDNA transfection L6 myoblasts seeded on coverslips in 6 - well plates were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , as described by the manufacturer . Briefly , 2 μ g of each cDNA was mixed with 4 μ L of Lipofectamine solution for 20 min and added to cells in serum - free α - MEM for 4 h . Cells were washed and incubated in α - MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS for 16 - 20 h . 144 Immunofluorescence microscopy For detection of GLUT4 myc and GFP - CD63 , GFP - VAMP2 , GFP - VAMP7 , or TfR . L6 - rat - GLUT4 myc and L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc myoblasts grown of coverslips were transfected with cDNA encoding either GFP - CD63 , GFP - VAMP2 , GFP - VAMP7 , HA - GLUT4 ( rat ) and 18 - 24h later , washed 3 times in ice - cold PBS + , fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS + for 30 min , quenched in 100 mM glycine for 10 min and then permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min , all at 4 C . Cells were then blocked in 5 % goat serum ( GS ) for 30 min , at room temperature and then incubated with either anti - myc antibodies alone ( 1 μ g / mL in 5 % GS ) or together with either anti - HA ( 1 : 3000 in 5 % GS ) or anti - TfR ( 1 : 100 in 5 % GS ) antibodies , as appropriate for 1 h . Following removal of excess antibodies by washing in PBS + , cells were incubated with appropriate Cy3 - or Cy2 - conjugated secondary antibodies for 1h , followed by extensive washing in PBS + . Coverslips were then mounted in DAKO on glass slides and fluorescent images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope . For detection of GLUT4myc and GM130 , calnexin , or TGN38 . Following serum starvation , L6 myoblasts grown of coverslips were washed 3 times in ice - cold PBS + and then treated with - 20C methanol for 20 min , on ice ( fixation and permeabilization ) . Cells were then washed 3X in PBS + followed by blocking , antibody labeling and image acquisition as described above . 4 . 3 Bt - GLUT4 expressed in L6 myoblasts exhibits lower basal intracellular retention , decreased insulin responsiveness and altered membrane traffic While screening stably transfected cell clones ( see Section 4 . 2 ) , several different single clones of L6 myocytes stably expressing bt - GLUT4 myc were obtained , as assessed by detection of the myc epitope by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting ( Figure 37A , panel i ) , 145 Clone 6 was selected based on similar levels of expression of GLUT4 myc to L6 - rat - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 37A , panel ii ) , and used in all subsequent experiments . As in skeletal muscle , L6 myoblasts , have approximately 10 % of total ( mammalian ) GLUT4 on the cell surface in the basal state [ 279 ] , due to mechanism of dynamic intracellular retention of GLUT4 in the absence of stimulus ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . In order to determine if bt - GLUT4 myc is similarly retained within L6 myoblasts , the proportion of myc epitope accessible to the extracellular milieu in intact cells was determined as a percentage of total cellular GLUT4 myc in cells expressing the fish or the rat transporter . Similar to previously reports , 13 . 6 ± 1 . 0 % of rat - GLUT4 myc was present on the cell surface in the basal state , and insulin increased this proportion to 28 . 5 ± 2 . 6 % ( Figure 37B ) . Interestingly , a significantly higher proportion ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 6 ) of total bt - GLUT4 myc relative to rat - GLUT4 myc was present on the cell surface in the basal state ( 21 . 8 ± 3 . 1 % ) , and insulin increased this to 27 . 2 ± 2 . 6 % . These results indicate that bt - GLUT4 myc is not retained intracellularly as efficiently rat - GLUT4 myc , although bt - GLUT4 myc is still able to translocate to the cell surface in response to insulin . 146 Figure 37 . L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc cells lines exhibit higher proportion of total GLUT4 on the cell surface relative to L6 - rat - GLUT4 myc although having similar GLUT4 protein levels . A . GLUT4 myc was immunoprecipitated from 300 μ g of whole - cell extracts , by α - myc monoclonal antibody , from isolated L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc clones ( i ) or clone 6 compared to L6 - rat - GLUT4 myc ( ii ) . Shown are representative immunoblots probed with polyclonal α - myc antibodies . B . L6 myoblasts stably expressing either rat - or bt GLUT4 myc , as indicated , were stimulated ( closed bars ) or not ( open bars ) with 100 nM insulin , and the proportion of GLUT4 myc at the cell surface , as a percentage of total cellular GLUT4 myc , was determined . Shown are the means ± SE of six independent experiments . * , p < 0 . 05 , relative to respective basal condition , ‡ , p < 0 . 05 , relative to rat - GLUT4myc basal condition . Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2007 ) 148 : 5248 - 57 In addition to insulin , several other stimuli elevate cell surface GLUT4 . Hypertonicity achieves this effect by inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , although stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis was also suggested [ 279 ] . Platelet - derived growth factor , by its stimulation of phosphatidyl inositol 3 - kinase activity , stimulates GLUT4 exocytosis , although in contrast to the effect of insulin , does not require actin remodeling or the SNARE VAMP2 for exocytosis [ 668 ] . As previously described , hypertonic medium , and 7 or 20 min of insulin or 7 min of PDGF stimulation cause a large ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 5 - 21 ) rise in cell surface rat - GLUT4 myc ( 2 . 02 ± 0 . 13 , 1 . 79 ± 0 . 26 , 2 . 03 ± 0 . 09 , 1 . 95 ± 0 . 31 - fold , respectively and Figure 38 ) . Interestingly , both 7 and 147 10 min and 7 min PDGF caused significant ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 5 - 21 ) increases in cell surface bt - GLUT4 myc ( 1 . 38 ± 0 . 17 , 1 . 40 ± 0 . 05 , 1 . 44 ± 0 . 10 - fold , respectively , Figure 38 ) , but the magnitude of these changes was significantly less than that of rat - GLUT4 myc in all cases ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 5 - 21 ) . Moreover , the amount of cell surface bt - GLUT4 myc was unaltered by treatment with hypertonic medium ( Figure 38 ) . Similar results were obtained with several clones of L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc described in Figure 37A , panel i , indicating that these observations were not specific to a particular L6 clonal background , but due to properties of bt - GLUT4 itself . Thus , in addition to an increased proportion of bt - GLUT4 myc at the cell surface in the basal state , bt - GLUT4 myc also exhibits insensitivity to the effects of hypertonicity . Figure 38 . Insulin and PDGF stimulate bt - GLUT4 myc translocation less that than rat - GLUT4 , whereas bt - GLUT4 is completely unresponsive to hypertonicity . Following serum starvation , L6 myoblasts stably expressing either rat - or bt - GLUT4 myc were stimulated with either 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose for 20 min , 100 nM insulin for 7 or 20 min , or 50 ng / mL platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) for 7 min , as indicated . The proportion of GLUT4 myc at the cell surface , as a percentage of total cellular GLUT4 myc , was determined . Shown are the means ± of 5 - 20 independent experiments . * , p < 0 . 05 , relative to respective basal condition . 148 Given that the level of GLUT4 at the cell surface is the balance between the internalization and exocytic rates , these kinetic parameters were compared between rat - and bt - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 37B ) . First , we analyzed the internalization of rat - GLUT4 myc and bt - GLUT4 myc by quantifying the amount of myc - tagged transporters remaining at the cell surface after 2 , 5 , and 10 min of endocytosis under basal conditions . The percentage of GLUT4 myc remaining at the plasma membrane was similar for bt - GLUT4 myc and rat - GLUT4 myc at all times of internalization examined ( Figure 39A ) , suggesting that the internalization rate of bt - GLUT4 myc is similar to that of rat - GLUT4 myc . In view of these results , we next investigated whether the amount of each transporter recycling through the plasma membrane during given time intervals was different between bt - and rat - GLUT4 myc . To this end , L6 myoblasts were incubated in α - MEM with anti - myc antibody for 50 - 400 min , thereby labeling any GLUT4 myc molecule arriving at the plasma membrane during this time ( Figure 39B ) . After this period , the amount of labeled GLUT4 myc at the plasma membrane was quantified and expressed as a fraction of the total amount of GLUT4 myc . At 200 and 300 min of recycling , a significantly greater amount of bt - GLUT4 myc had reached the cell surface , compared with rat - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 39B ) . Therefore , these results suggest that bt - GLUT4 myc recycles faster through the plasma membrane than its mammalian counterpart . Furthermore , the increased proportion of bt - GLUT4 myc on the cell surface in the basal state compared to rat - GLUT4 myc is explained by a higher basal rate of exocytosis , and not a difference in endocytic rate . 149 Figure 39 . bt - GLUT4 myc recycles through the plasma membrane at a faster basal rate than rat - GLUT4 myc , but internalizes at a similar rate . A . The fraction of either rat - or bt - GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface in L6 myoblasts at various times of internalization was determined . Results shown are the means ± SE of 15 – 29 independent experiments . B . The fraction of rat - or bt - GLUT4 myc that recycles through the plasma membrane at various times was determined . Results shown are the means ± SE of seven independent experiments . * , p < 0 . 01 , relative to fraction of rat - GLUT4 myc recycled , at the indicated times . Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2007 ) 148 : 5248 - 57 Since insulin , and to a lesser extent hypertonicity , cause an increase in the rate of rat - GLUT4 myc recycling [ 279 ] , the effect of each stimulus on bt - GLUT4 myc recycling was examined . Insulin stimulation resulted in an increase in both rat - and bt - GLUT4 myc recycling to the cell surface ( Figure 40A and B ) . However , whereas hypertonicity increased rat - GLUT4 myc recycling ( Figure 40A ) , bt - GLUT4 myc recycling was initially unaffected by hypertonicity ( t < 200 min ) , consistent with a lack of effect on steady - state cell surface bt - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 38 ) . Interestingly , when measured for longer times ( t = 300 - 400 min ) , hypertonicity significantly ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 5 ) reduced the rate of bt - GLUT4 myc recycling through the PM . This suggests that bt - GLUT4 myc is restricted to recycle to the plasma membrane by a route that has at least one 150 essential hypertonicity - sensitive step , whereas rat - GLUT4 myc recycling bypasses this requirement . This is consistent with bt - GLUT4 myc exhibiting altered membrane traffic relative to rat - GLUT4 myc observed by increased basal PM recycling ( Figure 39 ) . Figure 40 . Bt - GLUT4 myc recycling is increased by insulin stimulation but decreased by hypertonicity , whereas both stimuli increase rat - GLUT4 myc recycling . Following serum starvation , L6 myoblasts expressing either rat - GLUT4 myc or bt - GLUT4 myc were used to determine the fraction of GLUT4 myc recycling via the plasma membrane in the presence of 100 nM insulin , 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose , or absence of stimuli ( basal ) , as indicated . Shown are the means ± SE of 5 independent experiments . * , p < 0 . 05 , relative to fraction of respective basal GLUT4myc recycled . Reproduced with permission from Endocrinology ( 2007 ) 148 : 5248 - 57 Following internalization from the cell surface , mammalian GLUT4 traffics to a perinuclear storage compartment , and as a result , in the basal state , rat - GLUT4 is found largely in a tight , cone - like perinuclear morphology ( see Section 1 . 6 and Figure 34 ) . In order to determine if differences in bt - GLUT4 myc membrane traffic alter the transporter’s traffic to this perinuclear storage compartment , the localization of bt - GLUT4 myc was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy . Bt - GLUT4 myc staining was much more diffuse in the cytoplasm than rat - GLUT4 my c ( Figure 41 ) . That L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc cells had a normal tight perinuclear staining morphology of transiently expressed rat - GLUT4 - HA confirms that normal 151 cycling of mammalian GLUT4 occurs within L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc cells . Thus , the membrane traffic differences between rat and fish GLUT4 that manifest as a more diffuse bt - GLUT4 myc staining morphology throughout the cytoplasm are due to sequence differences between the two transporters . Figure 41 . Rat - GLUT4 myc exhibits tight basal perinuclear staining morphology whereas bt - GLUT4 myc is more diffuse in the cytoplasm . L6 myoblasts stably expressing either bt - or rat - GLUT4 myc were transiently transfected with HA - rat - GLUT4 , as indicated . Following serum starvation , respective GLUT4 fusion proteins were detected by immunofluorescence following labelling with both anti - HA and anti - myc antibodies . Shown are micrographs obtained with a confocal microscope , representative of four independent experiments , showing a similar single optical z - section of the perinuclear region of either bt - or rat - GLUT4 myc inL6 myoblasts . Scale 10 μ m . The different localization of bt - GLUT4 myc raises the possibility that this transporter is not properly processed and thus remains trapped in a biosynthetic organelle or targeted for degradation . To address this possibility , the localization of bt - GLUT4 myc relative to ER , Golgi and late endosomes / lysosomes was examined . CD63 ( LAMP3 ) is a membrane protein present on the PM but largely targeted to intralumenal vesicles in the late endosomes / lysosomes [ 669 ] . 152 GFP - CD63 expressed in L6 myoblasts was found in the perinuclear region and in cytosolic puncta that both overlapped poorly with both rat - and bt - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 42A ) . Thus , bt - GLUT4 myc does not appear to be targeted to the late endosome / lysosome in L6 myoblasts . Calnexin , an ER - resident chaperone [ 670 ] , was present on reticular structures throughout the cell , that overlapped poorly with both mammalian and fish GLUT4 ( Figure 42C ) . GM130 , is a peripheral cytoplasmic protein that localizes exclusively to the Golgi , particularly the cis - Golgi [ 671 ] , was present exclusively in ribbon - like structures near the nucleus that also showed poor overlap with either rat - or bt - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 42D ) . These results suggest that bt - GLUT4 myc does not exhibit altered membrane traffic compared to rat - GLUT4 myc as a consequence of misfolding that would have lead to retention in the ER or Golgi or increased targeting to the lysosome for degradation . Consistent with this interpretation , all of the bt - GLUT4 myc expressed in L6 cells is capable of recycling through the PM ( Figure 39 ) . Also , a significant increase in the basal and insulin - stimulated rates of glucose uptake is observed upon stable expression of bt - GLUT4 myc ( data not shown , [ 562 ] ) , showing that the transporter is functional in L6 myoblasts , likely as a result of proper biosynthesis . To better understand how the membrane traffic of bt - GLUT4 myc differs from that of mammalian transporters , the localization of GLUT4s relative to some proposed markers of membrane compartments normally visited by mammalian GLUT4 was examined . The intracellular membrane traffic of GLUT4 is known to overlap , in part , with that of the transferrin receptor ( see Section 1 . 6 ) , likely as a consequence of internalization by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Interestingly , although rat - GLUT4 myc exhibited significant overlap with TfR , bt - GLUT4 myc did not appear to overlap with TfR ( Figure 42E ) . These results suggest that , unlike mammalian GLUT4 ( see Section 1 . 6 ) , bt - GLUT4 myc does not traffic through the early and recycling endosomes in which TfR is found . In addition , GLUT4 has been proposed to transit through the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) before recycling to the cell surface , in a manner depending on a C - terminal acidic cluster [ 672 ] ; importantly , this motif is lacking in bt - GLUT4 . Although some overlap of both rat - and bt - GLUT4 myc was observed with the TGN marker TGN38 in the perinuclear region in L6 myoblasts , no differences could be discriminated between the extent of co - localization of each GLUT4 with TGN38 ( Figure 42B ) . 153 These results , taken together , suggest that bt - GLUT4 myc does not enter the same portion of the general recycling endosomes as mammalian GLUT4 . Since bt - GLUT4 myc is able to undergo insulin - stimulated translocation to the cell surface ( Figure 38 ) , an intriguing possibility is that bt - GLUT4 myc is still able to form insulin - regulated GLUT4 storage vesicles ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . To address this possibility , the localization of bt - GLUT4 myc relative to the SNARE proteins VAMP2 and VAMP7 was examined . Insulin - stimulated , but not basal GLUT4 exocytosis depends on VAMP2 , which has lead to the hypothesis that VAMP2 is a marker of the GSVs [ 288 , 673 ] . Both rat - and bt - GLUT4 myc exhibited marked co - localization with VAMP2 - GFP ( Figure 43 ) , suggesting that bt - GLUT4 myc , like rat - GLUT4 myc , does indeed target to GSVs . On the other hand , VAMP7 is required for basal recycling of mammalian GLUT4 to the cell surface [ 674 ] . Whereas rat - GLUT4 myc exhibited strong co - localization with this SNARE , a striking lack of bt - GLUT4 myc localization with VAMP7 was observed ( Figure 43 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that rat - GLUT4 myc is able to transit through endosomal compartments together with VAMP7 and TfR , and subsequently sort into TfR - negative , VAMP2 - positive GSVs , whereas bt - GLUT4 myc likely also traffics to GSVs , but not via TfR - and VAMP7 - positive recycling endosomes . That bt - GLUT4 myc has increased basal recycling to the cell surface compared to rat - GLUT4 myc suggests that the efficiency of sorting of bt - GLUT4 myc into GSVs , and thus intracellular retention , is less than that of mammalian transporters . 154 155 Figure 42 . bt - GLUT4 myc does not exhibit similar morphology as ER , Golgi , lysosome or recycling endosome . L6 myoblasts stabely expressing either bt - or rat - GLUT4 myc were transiently transfected with GFP - CD63 , as indicated . Following serum starvation , various proteins were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy following labelling with anti - myc antibobdies together with either α - TGN38 , - calnexin , - GM130 or - Transferrin Receptor ( TfR ) antibodies or GFP - CD63 fluorescence , as indicated . Shown are micrographs obtained with a confocal microscope , representative of four independent experiments , showing a similar single optical z - section of the perinuclear region .

Scale 10 μ m . 157 That bt - GLUT4 myc is only capable to undergo a subset of the membrane traffic route ( s ) travelled by mammalian GLUT4 suggests that the traffic through the VAMP7 - and TfR - positive recycling endosome is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation of GLUT4 sorting observed in mammals but not fish . Alternatively , it is possible that bt GLUT4 myc is unable to interact with mammalian membrane sorting complexes , and that , when expressed in trout muscle , the trout transporter are sorted identically to rat - GLUT4 in L6 ( rat ) cells . Unfortunately , this is difficult to test directly , as transgenic expression of GLUT4 myc in trout muscle is currently not technically feasible . However , staining of trout muscle with antibodies that recognize bt GLUT4 can allow examination of the staining morphology of endogenous bt GLUT4 . Consistent with the staining morphology of bt - GLUT4 myc in L6 myoblasts ( Figure 41 ) and myotubes ( data not shown ) , in trout myoblasts ( Figure 44A ) and myotubes ( Figure 44B ) , bt - GLUT4 was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm with minimal concentration of bt - GLUT4 in the perinuclear region . These results suggest that the traffic of bt - GLUT4 myc expressed in L6 myoblasts recapitulates the membrane traffic of bt GLUT4 in trout cells and that the differences in insulin responsiveness of trout and mammalian muscle lie in the sequence and motif differences between the GLUT4 orthologues . Figure 44 . bt - GLUT4 has similar diffuse staining morphology in trout myotubes as observed when bt - GLUT4 myc is expressed in L6 myocytes . Bt - GLUT4 has a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm in trout muscle cells . Immunolocalization of endogenous bt - GLUT4 was determined in unstimulated trout myoblasts ( A ) and myotubes ( B ) . Representative micrographs are shown . Scale , 20 μ m .

Although bt - GLUT4 myc retains responsiveness to insulin , this response is of a smaller magnitude than that of rat - GLUT4 myc , and there is a higher proportion of bt - GLUT4 myc on the cell surface in unstimulated cells compared to its mammalian counterpart . The increase of basal cell surface bt - GLUT4 myc is due to an increased recycling to the cell surface , without a detectable difference in the rate of fish versus mammalian transporter endocytosis ( Figure 39 ) . Thus , bt - GLUT4 myc is not retained intracellularly as efficiently as mammalian GLUT4 , suggesting that sorting of bt - GLUT4 myc to the insulin - responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles ( GSV ) is less effective for bt - GLUT4 myc than for rat - GLUT4 myc . As assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy , the lack of appreciable co - localization of bt - GLUT4 myc with calnexin , GM130 or CD63 suggests that bt - GLUT4 myc is not grossly miss - sorted to either the ER , Golgi or late endosome / lysosome , respectively ( Figure 42 ) . Identifying the location of GLUT4 within intracellular membrane compartments has been problematic due to the lack of adequate compartment markers ( see Section 1 . 6 ) , and the dynamic nature of GLUT4 sorting between these membrane pools . However , recent work has identified several SNAREs , each required for PM fusion of specific membrane pools of GLUT4 . Hence , each SNARE likely specifically populates distinct GLUT4 membrane pools . The requirement of a tetanus - toxin sensitive VAMP , later identified to be VAMP2 , for insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , but not basal GLUT4 membrane traffic , in both L6 myoblasts [ 673 ] and 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 288 ] , has suggested that VAMP2 is present on GSVs but not other GLUT4 membrane compartments . VAMP7 is required for basal , but not insulin - stimulated GLUT4 traffic to the plasma membrane , which suggests that VAMP7 is present only on recycling endosomes in L6 myoblasts [ 674 ] and 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 288 ] . Moreover , VAMP4 contributes to basal GLUT4 membrane traffic , specifically for GLUT4 exiting the biosynthetic pathway to the plasma membrane [ 288 ] . Consistent with this segregation of basal recycling GLUT4 pools by VAMPs , some stimuli , such as PDGF , stimulate GLUT4 translocation in L6 myoblasts without requiring VAMP2 [ 668 ] or VAMP7 ( V . Randhawa and A . Klip , unpublished 159 observations ) . Since VAMP4 cycles from the cell surface to the TGN [ 675 ] , interacts with the known TGN SNARES syntaxin 6 and 16 [ 485 ] and is required for the cycling of TGN38 from the cell surface to the TGN [ 485 ] , one of the recycling pools of GLUT4 may be the TGN ( see Figure 45 ) . Several experiments suggest that bt - GLUT4 myc likely does not transit through the recycling endosome pathway demarked by VAMP7 and employed by TfR . First , there is little co - localization of TfR and VAMP7 with bt - GLUT4 myc , whereas both VAMP7 and TfR overlap extensively with rat - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 43 ) . Second , hypertonic sucrose is known to alter cell surface GLUT4 myc largely by preventing its internalization via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME , [ 279 ] ) , a process also known to internalize TfR from the cell surface into the recycling endosomal membranes ( see Section 1 . 8 ) . Since hypertonic sucrose did not lead to an increase in cell surface GLUT4 myc , it is likely that bt - GLUT4 myc does not involve clathrin - mediated endocytosis , but relies on another , clathrin - independent endocytic mechanism , and thus would likely not be delivered , at least initially , to the same intracellular membranes as CME cargo ( TfR ) . The existence of both clathrin - dependent and independent routes for rat - GLUT4 myc internalization is revealed by the experiments presented in Chapter 5 . I propose a model where two distinct pools of recycling for mammalian GLUT4 that sort into insulin - responsive GSVs . The first , GLUT4 Recycling Pool 1 or GR1 , is likely populated by internalizing clathrin - coated vesicles , and contains TfR and VAMP7 . The second , GLUT4 Recycling Pool 2 or GR2 , perhaps as a consequence of another PM internalization mechanism , may recycle GLUT4 via a membrane compartment distinct from the TfR - positive recycling endosome . GR2 may include the TGN , in a manner that involves VAMP4 or another tetanus - toxin insensitive VAMP ( see Figure 45 ) . In this model , bt - GLUT4 myc is excluded from GR1 and thus restricted to GR2 . Consistent with this interpretation , bt - GLUT4 myc co - localizes with TGN38 , as does rat - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 42 ) . Interestingly , bt - GLUT4 myc translocation is elicited by PDGF , which requires a SNARE other than VAMP2 or 7 for fusion with the plasma membrane . Interestingly , prolonged incubation of L6 cells with hypertonic sucrose appears to trap bt - GLUT4 within the cell , preventing recycling to the plasma membrane ( Figure 39 ) . As clathrin - 160 dependent membrane budding is sensitive to hypertonicity [ 676 ] , this result suggests an absolute requirement for a clathrin - dependent intracellular sorting step for fish but not rat GLUT4 . For the Rab5 - and TfR - positive recycling endosomes ( GR1 ) , there may not be a requirement for intracellular membrane budding after internalization to achieve sorting ; instead , internalized vesicles may achieve proper recycling or degradation of cargo by compartment maturation [ 677 ] . This latter model is consistent with the observation that , when L6 cells are treated with hypertonic sucrose , thereby disrupting clathrin budding events [ 676 ] , all intracellular GLUT4 is still able to recycle via the plasma membrane . That bt - GLUT4 myc becomes trapped intracellularly by hypertonic sucrose may reflect a requirement of bt - GLUT4 to sort principally out of the TGN , which likely requires clathrin - dependent membrane budding , through adaptors such as AP1 , AP3 and Golgi - localized , gamma - ear - containing Arf - binding protein ( GGA ) [ 389 , 678 ] . Consistent with this , AP1 was found to be associated with GLUT4 vesicles [ 679 ] , and the N - terminal 5 FQQI 8 motif was shown , by yeast - 2 - hybrid , to bind the medium chain adaptins μ 1 , μ 2 and μ 3A [ 642 ] . Furthermore , a requirement for GGA for budding of GLUT4 vesicles and entry into an insulin - responsive membrane compartment has been previous shown [ 289 , 290 ] . In this way , rat - GLUT4 myc may exit the TGN and other membrane compartments by additional , non - clathrin mechanisms ( such as via AP4 ) , or may not populate compartments such as the TGN that require a budding step in order to recycle back to the plasma membrane under all conditions . It follows , then , that sorting of GLUT4 to the GSVs via GR1 is more efficient than via GR2 , based on the greater cell surface translocation of rat - GLUT4 versus bt - GLUT4 ( Figure 38 ) and the less efficient intracellular retention of bt - GLUT4 versus rat - GLUT4 ( Figure 39 ) . Determining the validity of this model will require testing of the functional dependence of bt - GLUT4 membrane traffic on VAMP molecules relative to that of rat - GLUT4 , under basal and stimulated conditions . 161 Figure 45 . Schematic of putative intracellular GLUT4 membrane compartments in L6 myoblasts . Shown are the TfR - positive recycling endosomes , trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and the insulin responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles ( GSV ) . Also shown are SNARES thought to be involved in respective membrane fusion steps : VAMP2 mediates insulin - stimulated exocytosis of GSVs ( brown arrow , [ 288 , 673 ] ) and sorting of GLUT4 into GSVs ( dark blue arrows , [ 288 ] ) . VAMP4 is required for exit from TGN into GSVs ( green arrows , [ 288 ] ) , and perhaps also to recycling endosomes ( pink arrows , [ 485 , 675 ] ) and PM ( light blue arrows ) . VAMP7 is required for PM fusion of GLUT4 within recycling endosomes ( orange arrow , [ 288 , 673 ] ) . VAMP8 is required for GLUT4 retreival from the plasma membrane following insulin stimulation ( red arrow , [ 288 ] ) Consistent with the existence of multiple distinct routes through which GLUT4 can recycle to arrive in a GSV or to the plasma membrane , basal GLUT4 recycling appears to behave differently depending on cell growth conditions ( see Section 1 . 6 and [ 286 ] ) . This plasticity of GLUT4 membrane traffic suggests that mammalian GLUT4 may shift its use of GR1 or GR2 . First , some groups have reported that the entire population of GLUT4 including GSVs is able to cycle to the cell surface in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 283 ] and L6 myotubes [ 26 ] , and that the effect of insulin is to increase the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis . Others have found that , in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , the GSV population of GLUT4 is unavailable to the plasma membrane in the 162 absence of insulin , and that insulin , in a dose - dependent manner , releases quanta of GLUT4 from the GSV pool to the plasma membrane [ 680 ] . This different behaviour of basal cycling of GLUT4 to the cell surface has been shown recently to depend on cell confluence [ 286 ] . A possible explanation for how cell growth conditions control GLUT4 basal recycling is via preferential usage of GR1 or GR2 in each state . Also , GLUT4 traffic through the TGN has been proposed by some groups by immunofluorescence [ 672 , 681 ] and immunoelectron [ 682 ] microscopy , and by a requirement for Rab31 , though to mediate TGN - to - endosome sorting [ 69 ] . Interestingly , cells treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid from cell surface IRAP , which has identical membrane traffic as GLUT4 , resulted in re - sialylation within 3 h , suggesting recycling of IRAP and GLUT4 through the TGN [ 672 ] . In contrast , other studies negate this , based on lack of ablation of GLUT4 following ablation of furin - containing membrane compartments [ 283 ] . Again , these discrepancies may reflect plasticity of GLUT4 dependence on GR1 and GR2 depending on cellular conditions . The existence of multiple motifs for GLUT4 sorting into GSVs is consistent with multiple discrete sorting steps . This does not , by itself , distinguish between distinct , parallel GLUT4 recycling pathways , and sequential sorting stages for GLUT4 within one recycling pathway . As seen in Section 4 . 1 , bt - GLUT4 myc retains some of the known mammalian GLUT4 sorting motifs ( 98 TELEYLGP 505 , 509 PDEND 512 , 500 LEYLGPDED 509 ) but not others ( 89 LL 490 , 491 EQE 493 , S488 ) . If GR1 and GR2 represent sequential recycling stages , then perturbation of this sequence should result in complete loss of sorting into GSVs . That the fish transporter retains some insulin - responsiveness would suggest it is able to sort into GSVs , making it likely that GR1 and GR2 are parallel mechanisms of arrival at GSVs . The disruption of retention of GLUT4 myc by GFP - G4loop ( see Chapter 3 ) could conceivably be due to action on recycling through GR1 or GR2 . Finally , from an evolutionary perspective , fish GLUT4 may represent a more primitive form of the mammalian transporter with regards to membrane traffic and responsiveness to insulin . Sorting of GLUT4 from the plasma membrane to the GSVs via the TGN ( GR2 ) may be a more ancient phenomenon arrival in GSVs via the recycling endosomes ( GR1 ) . The entry of GLUT4 into GR1 may have evolved in the evolutionary time between fish and mammals . This 163 idea is in keeping with the notion that during evolution , development of a parallel process that exhibits a particular gain - of - function is much more frequent than alterations to a pre - existing process , due to the likelihood that any particular mutation within the pre - existing process will result in loss - of - function [ 683 ] . Use of comparative genomics followed by functional cell biological analysis may be a practical method of studying membrane traffic , particularly of complex sorting pathways . 164 Chapter 5 5 Mechanism and Regulation of GLUT4 internalization in L6 myocytes Part of the work described in this Chapter was previously published within ( as indicated ) : Antonescu CN , Diaz M , Femia G , Planas JV , and Klip A . Clathrin - dependent and independent endocytosis of glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) in myoblasts : regulation by mitochondrial uncoupling . Traffic . 2008 . 9 : 1173 - 90 All results presented are the results of experiments performed by Costin N . Antonescu . 165 5 . 1 Introduction In addition to being the principal carrier for glucose disposal in response to insulin and muscle contraction [ 13 ] , GLUT4 is also responsible for the elevation in glucose uptake under conditions of cellular stress [ 381 , 383 ] . Moreover , muscle cell surface GLUT4 is elevated not only by insulin but also by treatments that emulate physiological contraction [ 345 ] and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation [ 383 , 684 - 686 ] . Much attention has been given to the study of GLUT4 exocytosis , as its rate is stimulated by insulin in both muscle and adipose cells . Far less is known about the internalization of the transporter , in general , and in the specific case of exercise and stress signals , the specific contributions of exocytic and endocytic pathways remain to be defined . Interestingly , in adipocytes , insulin reduces the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis [ 282 , 643 , 687 ] , and a recent study suggests that this occurs through re - routing of GLUT4 endocytosis to a slower pathway involving the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 [ 643 ] . In muscle cells , removal of insulin does not alter the rate of GLUT4 internalization [ 688 ] , but the effect of insulin on GLUT4 endocytosis has not been formally studied . Notable differences between insulin - and contraction - stimulated GLUT4 redistribution , with regards to signaling molecules involved , as well as GLUT4 - vesicle compartments taxed , suggest distinct mechanisms of action ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . In recent years , there have been major advances in our understanding of endocytic routes and mechanisms of membrane - bound cargo ( see Section 1 . 8 ) . In particular , a number of mechanisms of internalization have been described beyond clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . Internalization via caveolae occurs for sphingolipids such as lactosyl ceramide [ 459 ] as well as for the glutamate transporter EAAC1 [ 466 ] , and EGFR under conditions of oxidative stress [ 689 ] . Furthermore , the dynamin - and RhoA - dependent endocytosis of the interleukin 2 receptor , IL - 2R [ 484 ] , and the dynamin - independent , but Cdc42 - and flotillin - dependent endocytosis of GPI - anchored proteins [ 488 , 500 ] are clathrin - and caveolae - independent processes . 166 In the case of GLUT4 , several routes of endocytosis have been described in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes . This is consistent with other studies showing that endocytosis of the same cargo may engage more than one route of internalization , depending on cell type and stimulation conditions , as is the case for EGFR [ 689 ] . Internalization of GLUT4 via CME was originally suggested from the interfering effect of hypertonicity and low extracellular K + in rat adipocytes [ 690 ] , and from the presence of clathrin on GLUT4 - containing vesicles [ 691 , 692 ] . Moreover , FQQI and LL sequences on GLUT4 resemble clathrin adaptor consensus motifs ( see Chapter 3 & 4 ) , although there is controversy as to their involvement in GLUT4 endocytosis [ 284 , 642 , 647 ] . In addition , GLUT4 colocalizes extensively with cell surface clathrin structures in the TIRF imaging zone , in both basal and insulin - stimulated 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 693 ] . Yet , knockdown of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 only reduced GLUT4 internalization in the insulin - stimulated state [ 643 ] . Given that AP - 2 independent forms of CME exist [ 399 ] , these combined observations question the extent of participation of clathrin itself in GLUT4 internalization , both in insulin - stimulated and basal conditions . On the other hand , GLUT4 endocytosis through non - clathrin - dependent pathways was also suggested from its sensitivity to the cholesterol - perturbing drugs nystatin [ 694 ] , methyl - β - cyclodextrin [ 695 ] , and to caveolin - 1 mutants [ 695 ] . Clathrin - independent endocytic carriers differ in their requirement for the GTPase dynamin ( see Section 1 . 8 ) . Dynamin is required for GLUT4 internalization in adipocytes [ 642 , 696 - 698 ] . However , it is not known whether all of GLUT4 requires dynamin for internalization , or whether dynamin also participates in the CME - independent mechanism ( s ) of GLUT4 endocytosis . Finally , in L6 myoblasts , our group previously observed that hypertonicity and low extracellular K + retard GLUT4 internalization [ 688 ] , suggesting participation of CME . From the above it is clear that there is disparate information regarding the routes of GLUT4 internalization in adipocytes , and there is a dirth of detail of this phenomenon in muscle cells . Yet , in vivo , glucose disposal occurs primarily into this tissue . Given that the same cargo may engage different routes in different cells , the purpose of the work presented in this Chapter is to systematically analyze the molecular mechanism of GLUT4 endocytosis in muscle cells . 167 Furthermore , the potential regulation of of GLUT4 internalization by diverse stimuli that increase surface GLUT4 levels was also examined . 5 . 2 Methods The following methods were performed as previously described : cell culture ( Section 2 . 2 ) , lysis and immunoblotting ( Section 2 . 2 ) and cDNA transfection ( Section 4 . 2 ) . Materials Polyclonal anti - myc antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz ( Santa Cruz , CA ) or Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) for cell population and single cell protocols , respectively . Monoclonal anti - syntaxin - 6 , anti - caveolin - 1 and anti - clathrin heavy chain and anti - dynamin - 2 antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences ( San Jose , CA ) and anti - transferrin antibodies were obtained from Biomeda ( Foster City , CA ) . Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated and Cy3 - conjugated goat - anti - rabbit antibodies and Cy - 2 conjugated donkey anti - mouse antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immuno Research ( West Grove , PA ) . Human holo - transferrin , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD , o - phenylenediamide ( OPD ) , and dinitrophenol were obtained from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . BODIPY - FL - C 5 - lactosylceramide ( LacCer ) was from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . Human insulin was from Eli Lilly ( Indianapolis , IN ) . Dynamin - 2 K44A cDNA was a kind gift from Dr . Mark McNiven ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , NY ) . GLUT4 myc - eGFP cDNA and caveolin - 1 WT , S80E and S80A cDNAs were a kind gift from Dr . Jeffrey E . Pessin ( Stony Brook University , NY ) . Clathrin light chain - eGFP cDNA was a kind gift from Dr . Juan S . Bonifacino ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . CHC - GFP ( [ 699 ] GFP fused to 1 - 1675 of human clathrin heavy chain ) was a kind gift of Dr . Stephen J . Royle ( Univeristy of Liverpool , UK ) . The following siRNA sequences were obtained from Qiagen ( Valencia , CA ) : non - related ( NR : AAA TTC TAT CAG TAG CGT GAC ) , CHC1 ( AAC CCG AGT TAT GGA 168 GTA TAT ) , CHC2 ( AAG AGC TCT TCG CCC GGA AAT ) , SX6 - 1 ( CCG AGT CAT CAG AAG AAC TAA ) , SX6 - 2 ( ATG CGA CTG AAT TGA GCA TAA ) . siRNA transfection Twenty - four hours following seeding , L6 myoblasts were transfected with siRNA constructs using CellPhect ( GE Health Care Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) as described by the manufacturer . Briefly , cells were incubated with 100 nM of each siRNA construct in solution provided , for 12 - 16 h in α - MEM supplemented with 5 % FBS . Subsequently , cells were washed and incubated in α - MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS for 56 - 60 h , for a total of 72 h of siRNA transfection . GLUT4myc internalization : cell population - based assay GLUT4 myc internalization was perfomed on cell populations as dedcribed in Section 4 . 2 . Note that The amount of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface following various times of internalization , measured in triplicate , was expressed as a fraction of GLUT4 myc at the cell surface prior to internalization . Hence , normalization makes all results independent of the amount bound at the surface prior to internalization . Treatments with insulin , DNP , hypertonic sucrose , or cholesterol depletion , were applied to cells both cells both prior to and following antibody labeling . Cell surface labeling with 1 μ g / mL of anti - myc antibody at 4C achieved 85 % saturation of GLUT4 my c ( data not shown ) , determined as previously described for anti - myc monoclonal antibodies [ 567 ] . Under these conditions , labeling of L6 cells that do not express GLUT4 myc ( L6 - WT ) was only 5 . 0 ± 0 . 1 % ( n = 3 ) of the labeling seen in the basal state of L6 - GLUT4 myc cells ( Figure 46 ) . Because the amount of antibody remaining at the surface was normalized to that observed in cells labeled at 4C in parallel , the absolute amount of initial label does not contribute to the observed rate of internalization . As a further control , when L6 myoblasts were fixed and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % TX - 100 for 30 min at 4C following the internalization stage , all of the initially labeled anti - myc antibodies were detected by HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies at all times of internalization 169 ( Figure 46 ) . This indicates that anti - myc label was not lost from the cells into the medium during the re - warming stages , and that a decrease in cell surface - associated anti - myc in intact cells represents bona fide GLUT4 internalization . GLUT4myc or IL2R β internalization : single cell assay Given the limited efficiency of cDNA transfection , some experiments required a single - cell approach to score GLUT4 or IL2R β endocytosis . For IL2R β internalization , L6 myoblasts were transfected with IL2R β cDNA 16 - 20 h prior to experimentation . Cells were then serum - deprived for 3 to 5 h and stimulated as indicated , in serum - free α - MEM at 37C . Cells were washed in ice - cold PBS + , then blocked in ice - cold 5 % GS in PBS + for 15 min . Subsequently , surface GLUT4 myc or IL2R β in intact , non - permeabilized L6 cells were labeled with anti - myc antibody ( 1 μ g / mL in PBS + with 5 % GS ) or anti - Il2R β mAb 561 ( 1 : 300 in PBS + with 5 % GS , [ 484 ] ) , respectively . The cells were washed extensively in ice - cold PBS + , twice with 37C PBS + ( re - warming stage ) , and returned to 37C α - MEM containing pre - labeling stimulus for 5 min , as indicated ( internalization stage ) . Following internalization of surface proteins , cells were rapidly washed in ice - cold PBS + to arrest membrane traffic . Anti - myc or anti - IL2R β antibodies remaining at the cell surface were then detected by Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibodies . Excess secondary antibodies were removed by washing and cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS + for 30 min at 4C , followed by quenching of the fixative for 10 min in 100 mM glycine in PBS + . Parallel coverslips were not re - warmed after anti - myc antibody labeling to allow measurement of steady - state levels of cell surface GLUT4 myc . Coverslips were then mounted in DAKO on glass slides and fluorescent images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope . Whole cell mounts were scanned along the z - axis and a single composite image ( collapsed xy stacked projection ) was generated using LSM5 Image software . Surface GLUT4 myc or IL2R β in each cell were quantified using ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , USA ) . The fraction of GLUT4 myc or IL2R β internalized in 5 min in each condition was normalized to that the fraction internalized in the same time in basal , untransfected cells . Transferrin internalization assay 170 The internalization of transferrin [ 663 ] was measured on cell populations by a method similar to that used to measure GLUT4 myc internalization . Surface TfR were labeled by sequential incubation of L6 cells with 30 μ g / mL human holo - transferrin [ 663 ] in 5 % GS in PBS + for 1 h at 4C , followed by removal of excess Tf by washing in PBS + , and incubation with anti - Tf antibody solution ( 6 μ g / ml in PBS + with 5 % GS ) , all at 4C . Excess anti - Tf antibodies were removed by washing in PBS + at 4C . Following washing , re - warming , internalization and subsequent treatments were performed as for GLUT4 myc internalization . Importantly , if L6 myoblasts were fixed and permeabilized ( 0 . 1 % TX - 100 for 30 min at 4C ) following the re - warming stage , all of the initially labeled anti - Tf antibodies were detected by HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies at all times of internalization ( Figure 46 ) . This indicates that no Tf or anti - Tf label was lost into the medium during the re - warming stages , and that a decrease in detection of cell surface anti - Tf in intact cells represents bona fide internalization of Tf . 171 Figure 46 . Anti - Transferrin and anti - myc antibodies do not dissociate from cells during internalization assay . Basal L6 myoblasts were labeled with anti - myc primary antibodies ( A ) or transferrin followed by anti - transferrin primary antibodies ( B ) for detection of cell surface GLUT4 myc or Tf , respectively at 4C . Following rewarming of cells at 37 C as per GLUT4 and Tf internalization assays , cells were fixed and permeabilized , and probed with HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies to detect the total cellular amount of primary antibodies at various times of rewarming . Results are expressed as a fraction of that detected in cells maintained at 4C throughout the rewarming process and shown as means ± SE of 3 - 5 independent experiments . C . Shown are stacked projections of z - plane images obtained by confocal microscopy of cell surface GLUT4 myc labeling at the cell surface prior to internalization in either L6 - GLUT4 myc cells or L6 cells that do not express GLUT4 myc ( L6 - WT ) . Images are representative of 3 independent experiments . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 Lactosyl ceramide internalization assay Internalization of lactosyl ceramide ( LacCer ) was scored as described in [ 459 ] . Briefly , L6 myoblasts grown on coverslips were serum starved for 3 to 5 h , treated as indicated , then incubated with 1 μ g / mL BODIPY FL C 5 - lactosylceramide ( LacCer ) in PBS + for 1 h . Excess LacCer was washed away by ice - cold PBS + . Cells were re - warmed by washing twice in 37C PBS + , followed by internalization in α - MEM for either 0 ( control ) or 15 minutes at 37C . Upon arrest of membrane traffic with ice - cold PBS + , LacCer remaining at the cell surface was removed by six 10 - min washes in 2 % defatted BSA at 10C . Cells were then fixed in 4 % 172 paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4C , followed by quenching of the fixative with 100 mM glycine in PBS + . Coverslips were mounted in DAKO on glass slides and confocal microscopy and analysis was performed as for GLUT4 myc endocytosis protocol . Detection of GLUT4 myc , GLUT4 - HA and Il - 2R β co - localization immediately following internalization . Cell surface GLUT4 myc and IL - 2R β were labeled as described above for GLUT4myc or IL2R β internalization : single cell assay . Additionally , cells previously transiently transfected with rat - GLUT4 - HA underwent cell surface labeling of GLUT4 - HA by similar incubation with α - HA antibodies ( 1 : 3000 ) in 5 % GS , were indicated . The cells were washed extensively in ice - cold PBS + , twice with 37C PBS + ( re - warming stage ) , and returned to 37C α - MEM containing pre - labeling stimulus for 5 min ( internalization stage ) . Membrane traffic was arrested by two rapid washed in ice - cold PBS + , followed by stripping of antibodies remaining at the cell surface ( non - internalized ) by four 15 min washes with low pH solution ( PBS + , pH 3 . 0 , supplemented with 3 mM BSA and 50 mM glycine , [ 484 ] ) . Cells were then washed twice , fixed in 4 % PFA for 30 min , quenched in 100 mM glycine for 10 min and permeabilized for 30 min in 0 . 1 % TX - 100 , all ice . Secondary antibody labeling and imaging was performed as described in GLUT4myc or IL2R β internalization : single cell assay . GLUT4 co - localization with caveolin - 1 , dynamin - 2 and clathrin light chain . L6 myoblasts were transfected with cDNA encoding clathrin light chain fused to GFP ( CLC - eGFP ) . On the day of the experiment ( 16 - 20 h following transfection ) , cells were serum - deprived for 3 to 5 h and then stimulated as indicated , in serum - free α - MEM at 37C . Cells were washed in ice - cold PBS + , then blocked in ice - cold 5 % milk and 3 % BSA in PBS + for 15 min . Subsequently , surface GLUT4 myc in intact , non - permeabilized L6 cells was labeled with anti - myc antibody ( 1 μ g / mL in PBS + with 5 % GS ) . For CLC - GFP and dynamin - 2 localization , cells 173 were then washed extensively in ice - cold PBS + , fixed with 4 % PFA for 30 min , quenched in 100 mM glycine for 10 min and then permeabilized by 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min . Following additional blocking , cells were labeled as required with anti - dynamin - 2 antibodies ( 1 : 100 dilution ) for 1 h , followed by extensive washing to remove excess antibodies . For caveolin - 1 staining , cells were fixed for 10 min in 4 % PFA and then 10 min in 90 % methanol , followed by quenching in 100 mM glycine for 10 min . Following additional blocking , cells were labeled as required with anti - caveolin - 1 antibodies ( 1 : 100 dilution ) for 1 h , followed by extensive washing of excess antibodies . Cells were then labeled with appropriate secondary antibodies to detect anti - myc or anti - caveolin - 1 , washed , and coverslips were mounted in DAKO on glass slides . Confocal fluorescence microscopy and analysis was performed as described in the GLUT4 myc endocytosis protocol . Statistical analysis - Analysis of statistical significance of differences in measurements between samples was done by one - way ANOVA with Newman - Keul ' s post - test for assays with > 2 experimental conditions or otherwise by Student’s t - test . All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4 . 00 for Windows , GraphPad Software ( San Diego California USA , www . graphpad . com ) . 5 . 3 Results GLUT4 internalization is only partly dependent on clathrin In order to determine whether GLUT4 utilizes clathrin for internalization in L6 myoblasts , the effect of clathrin disruption on the kinetics of GLUT4 internalization was 174 determined . GLUT4 myc internalization in L6 - GLUT4 myc myoblasts was assayed through a cell - population based assay ( see Section 4 . 2 and 5 . 2 ) . The cell - surface transporters were labeled at 4C using antibodies to an exofacial myc - epitope in intact living cells . Subsequently , cells were re - warmed to 37C , allowing internalization of the antibody - GLUT4 complexes and the fraction of GLUT4 remaining at the cell surface at each timepoint of internalization was determined by measuring the amount of myc - antibody remaining at the cell surface . The study was limited to short periods of GLUT4 internalization ( < 10 min ) in order to minimize the reappearance of labeled GLUT4 at the cell surface following internalization observed at longer timepoints [ 279 ] . The rate of GLUT4 internalization is reduced in hypertonic solution , suggesting the involvement of a clathrin - dependent mechanism [ 688 ] . Hypertonic sucrose disrupts CME by altering the morphology of assembled clathrin [ 700 ] and the ability of individual clathrin subunits to exchange into such altered clathrin structures [ 676 ] . However , whether there are additional routes of GLUT4 internalization and whether they are regulated remains unknown [ 694 , 695 ] . In order to assess the extent of CME disruption , the internalization of transferrin ( Tf , a well - studied marker of CME ) was monitored by an assay analogous to that used for GLUT4 internalization . Treating L6 - GLUT4 myc cells with 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose in α - MEM ( prior to and following antibody labeling ) nearly completely arrested Tf internalization ( Figure 47A , panel i ) , whereas GLUT4 internalization was only partly reduced ( Figure 47A , panel ii ) . The basal rate of GLUT4 internalization ( i . e . , in untreated cells ) was significantly higher than that of Tf ( Figure 47A , panels i and ii ) , making it difficult to compare the rate of internalization of each protein in hypertonic medium . For this reason , the amount of each cargo internalized in hypertonic medium was normalized to that in the respective basal condition ( Figure 47B ) . At 2 , 5 and 10 min of re - warming , normalized Tf internalization in hypertonic medium was 33 ± 11 % , 43 ± 13 % and 36 ± 9 % , respectively ( n = 9 ) that of basal cells , which is significantly less ( p < 0 . 05 ) than the internalization of GLUT4 ( 59 ± 7 % , 66 ± 6 % and 63 ± 4 % , respectively , n = 16 ) . These results suggest that in hypertonic medium , which disrupts CME , GLUT4 internalization is less inhibited than that of Tf , suggesting that GLUT4 may simultaneously internalize through other route ( s ) . 175 Figure 47 . Differential internalization of GLUT4 myc and Tf through CME observed by hypertonic medium . A . The fraction of Tf ( i ) or GLUT4 myc ( ii ) remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization in L6 myoblasts untreated or treated with 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose for 30 min was determined and shown are the means ± SE of 9 to 16 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control condition .

Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 However , hypertonic treatment triggers a substantial stress response in cells , as seen by the robust activation of MAPKs ( see Chapter 2 ) . Moreover , although widely used to examine internalization through CME , the specificity of this method for disruption of CME is unclear . Thus , use of siRNA gene silencing of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC , [ 398 , 399 , 699 , 701 ] ) was used to directly and specifically assess the participation of CME in GLUT4 myc internalization . 176 Transfection of each of two distinct siRNA sequences ( CHC1 and CHC2 ) resulted in a reduction of 73 ± 8 % and 78 ± 3 % , respectively , of CHC expression , relative to cells treated with non - related ( NR ) siRNA ( n = 8 , p < 0 . 001 ; and Figure 48A ) . Both CHC1 and CHC2 siRNA led to a robust inhibition of Tf internalization ( Figure 48B , panel i ) , while causing only partial reduction in GLUT4 internalization ( Figure 48B , panel ii ) . The extent of Tf and GLUT4 internalized in CHC2 siRNA treated cells was normalized to each respective NR - siRNA - treated condition ( Figure 48C ) . Consistent with the observations made by disrupting CME with hypertonic sucrose , depletion of CHC resulted in less Tf internalization upon re - warming ( 35 ± 10 % , 37 ± 10 % , 67 ± 8 % , at 2 , 5 and 10 minutes , respectively , n = 11 ) than GLUT4 internalization ( 61 ± 7 % , 78 ± 3 % , 85 ± 4 % , respectively , n = 16 ) when compared to NR - siRNA treated cells . That there was still significant internalization of Tf , especially at 10 min of re - warming , suggests that the remaining ~ 25 % of CHC following siRNA gene silencing can facilitate some , albeit reduced , CME . However , siRNA gene silencing of CHC inhibited GLUT4 myc internalization significantly less than that of Tf , similar to what was observed with treatment with hypertonic medium , which achieved nearly complete inhibition of Tf internalization . Moreover , inhibition of internalization causes a proportional increase of the steady - state amount of cargo protein on the cell surface . Disruption of CME by either hypertonic medium for 20 min or CHC depletion resulted in a larger ( p < 0 . 05 ) steady - state cell surface gain for Tf ( 2 . 8 ± 0 . 40 fold , n = 13 ; 5 . 5 ± 1 . 42 fold , n = 5 ; respectively ) than for GLUT4 ( 2 . 0 ± 0 . 3 , n = 11 ; 2 . 3 ± 0 . 11 n = 14 ; respectively ) compared to untreated , untransfected cells . That more Tf accumulated on the cell surface than GLUT4 suggests that GLUT4 is less dependent on CME than is Tf . These results further support the tenet that GLUT4 internalization occurs only in part through CME . 177 Figure 48 . A . Differential internalization of GLUT4 myc and Tf through CME observed by siRNA gene silencing of CHC . A . Clathrin heavy chain ablation .

Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 178 The complete dependence of Tf on CME for internalization is well established . Previous studies have observed similar inhibition ( ~ 80 % ) of Tf internalization following similar levels knockdown ( ~ 80 % ) of CHC by different siRNAs [ 398 , 699 , 701 ] . Importantly , the full rate of Tf internalization was rescued by expression of knockdown - proof GFP - CHC concomitantly to CHC depletion [ 699 ] , demonstrating that inhibition of Tf uptake by CHC depletion was not due to off - target effects of the siRNA . In order to test for possible off - target effects of siRNAs to CHC that could result in inhibition of GLUT4 internalization , cells were transfected with cDNA encoding full - length human CHC fused to GFP ( CHC - GFP , [ 699 ] ) or GFP alone , together with depletion of CHC with siRNA . Human CHC has single nucleotide differences in regions corresponding to both rat siRNA sequences used , and thus is expected not to be sensitive to siRNA gene silencing by CHC1 or CHC2 . Accordingly , whereas L6 myoblasts treated with CHC1 or CHC2 siRNA , and subsequently transfected GFP alone had greatly reduced CHC levels , cells transfected instead with GFP - CHC had CHC levels comparable to cells transfected with NR siRNA ( Figure 49A ) . That human CHC formed puncta when expressed in L6 cells ( rat ) cells suggest that human CHC , despite some sequence differences to rat CHC , accumulates within and aids to form clathrin - coated pits and vesicles and likely functionally replaces depleted rat CHC . This indicates that expression of GFP - CHC is a viable way to rescue expression of CHC in cells transfected with CHC siRNA , and thus allows determination of possible off - target effects of this CME inhibition strategy . Consistent with results presented in Figure 48 , L6 myoblasts first treated with CHC1 or CHC2 siRNA and then transfected with GFP exhibited reduced GLUT4 myc internalization compared to NR - siRNA treated cells ( 65 . 9 ± 7 . 4 % and 68 . 4 ± 6 . 8 % , respectively , n = 3 and Figure 49C and D ) . However , L6 myoblasts instead transfected with GFP - CHC following CHC knockdown exhibited full GLUT4 myc internalization ( 104 . 3 ± 9 . 1 % and 97 . 3 ± 2 . 5 % , respectively , n = 3 , and Figure 49C and D ) . Inhibition of GLUT4 myc internalization causes a proportional increase in steady - state GLUT4 myc at the cell surface . The increase in steady - state GLUT4 , compared to NR - siRNA treated cells , in cells transfected with siRNA to CHC1 or CHC2 , expressing GFP ( 1 . 82 ± 0 . 30 and 2 . 34 ± 0 . 34 fold , respectively ) , was significantly greater ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 05 ) than in cells treated with CHC1 or CHC2 , and expressing GFP - CHC ( 1 . 21 ± 0 . 26 and 1 . 47 ± 0 . 24 - fold , respectively ) . More GLUT4 myc accumulation on the cell surface in 179 the absence of GFP - CHC rescue suggests the increase in cell surface GLUT4 resulting from CHC depletion is due to specific disruption of CME . These results demonstrate that the inhibition of GLUT4 myc internalization observed by siRNA to CHC was not due to off - target effects of the siRNA , but instead was due to specific loss of CHC . Thus , taken together , these results show that GLUT4 internalizes in part by CME , as well as simultaneously by a CME - independent mechanism . 180 Figure 49 . Expression of GFP - CHC reverses inhibition of GLUT4 myc internalization by siRNA gene silencing of CHC . L6 myoblasts were transfected with either NR , CHC1 or CHC2 siRNA for 72h .

Arrows indicate cells transfected with either CHC1 or CHC2 siRNA that also express GFP - CHC , showing recovery of CHC protein expression ( A ) or normal steady state cell surface GLUT4 myc and GLUT4 myc endocytosis ( D ) . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 Several clathrin - independent endocytic pathways have been reported , which are acutely sensitive to depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane ( reviewed by [ 494 ] ) . Cholesterol depletion can be achieved using methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) ; however , care must be exercised to ensure that CME is not affected . CME was reported to be inhibited by depletion of large amounts of membrane cholesterol [ 702 , 703 ] , and this effect may be cell - type dependent , as various cells may may have different membrane lipid content . Although we observed minor inhibition of Tf internalization at 10 mM M β CD ( data not shown ) , L6 myoblasts treated with 3 mM M β CD had normal Tf internalization ( Figure 50 panel i ) , whereas GLUT4 internalization was partly inhibited ( Figure 50A , panel ii ) . Consistent with a specific effect on non - CME internalization when used at 3 mM , M β CD did not render cells permeable to propridium iodide , which was observed at high ( 10 mM ) concentrations [ 704 ] . To confirm that the reduction in GLUT4 internalization caused by M β CD was due to an effect on an endocytic pathway other than CME , the possible additivity of M β CD treatment and depletion of CHC by siRNA was examined ( Figure 50B ) . Additive inhibition of GLUT4 myc internalization by M β CD and disruption of CME would suggest that these act by inhibition of two distinct processes . The fraction of GLUT4 internalized in cells treated with siRNA to CHC , hypertonic medium or M β CD , alone or in combination , was normalized to that in untreated , NR - siRNA transfected cells . The combined treatments of M β CD and siRNA to CHC caused a significantly greater reduction in GLUT4 internalization than either treatment alone ( Figure 50B , 182 panel i ) , whereas the combined treatments with hypertonic sucrose and CHC siRNA , both targeting CME , had no additive effect ( Figure 50B , panel ii ) . That hypertonic sucrose and siRNA to CHC both have similar effects when used separately , and that they were not additive , suggests that each affects GLUT4 internalization by specific perturbation of CME . This result confirms those that demonstrate that siRNA gene silencing is not due to off target effects ( Figure 49 ) . Moreover , hypertonic treatment also likely inhibits GLUT4 internalization by specific inhibition of CME . These observations suggest that GLUT4 internalization in myoblasts occurs through a clathrin - dependent pathway as well as a separate , clathrin - independent , but cholesterol - dependent endocytic pathway ( ChDE ) . 183 Figure 50 . GLUT4 myc but not Tf endocytosis is sensitive to mild cholesterol depletion . A . The fraction of Tf ( i ) or GLUT4 myc ( ii ) remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization in L6 myoblasts untreated or treated with 3 mM methyl β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) for 1 h was determined and shown are the means ± SE of 6 to 13 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control condition .

Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 184 GLUT4 internalization does not change upon L6 cell differentiation L6 myoblasts differentiate into multinucleated myotubes recapitulating the process of myogenic differentiation in vivo ( see Section 1 . 3 ) . It has been reported that in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , GLUT4 myc internalization occurs differently in differentiated cells and undifferentiated pre - adipocytes [ 302 , 643 ] . Unlike 3T3 - L1 pre - adipocytes , GLUT4 myc stably expressed in L6 myoblasts is sorted away from constitutively recycling proteins and its membrane traffic is regulated by insulin indistinguishably from that in differentiated myotubes [ 528 , 561 ] . However , it was plausible that the rate and pathways of GLUT4 internalization might differ between myoblasts and myotubes . To address this possibility , the mechanism of GLUT4 internalization was also examined in differentiated L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes . The fraction of GLUT4 internalized at 2 , 5 or 10 min in basal myotubes ( 0 . 44 ± 0 . 03 , 0 . 36 ± 0 . 05 , 0 . 25 ± 0 . 04 , respectively , n = 7 ) was indistinguishable from that observed in myoblasts ( 0 . 47 ± 0 . 04 , 0 . 37 ± 0 . 03 , 0 . 25 ± 0 . 03 , respectively , n = 16 ) . Moreover , as observed in myoblasts , GLUT4 myc internalization in myotubes was only partly inhibited upon reducing CME by hypertonicity or CME - independent internalization by cholesterol depletion ( Figure 51A ) . Thus , unlike the transition observed between 3T3 - L1 pre - adipocytes and adipocytes , there are no changes in the rate or routes of GLUT4 internalization during the process of L6 myocyte differentiation . This interpretation is consistent with the observation that , during 3T3 - L1 differentiation , the expression of sortilin [ 299 ] , and perhaps other factors , are induced to allow stable , insulin - responsive expression of GLUT4 , whereas L6 myocytes express sortilin both at the myoblasts and myotube stages ( S . Ishikura and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , reflecting the ability of L6 myoblasts to traffic GLUT4 as in differentiated muscle . 185 Figure 51 . GLUT4 internalization is independent of differentiation stage . A . L6 - GLUT4 myc myotubes were treated with either 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose for 30 min or 3 mM M β CD for 1 h ( A ) , 100 nM insulin for 20 min ( B ) , or left untreated ( basal ) , as indicted , and subsequently the fraction of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization was determined . Shown are the means ± SE of 4 to 9 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control condition . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 GLUT4 internalization via ChDE is independent of caveolae but dependent on dynamin Several types of ChDE have been described , including caveolae - dependent endocytosis , as well as caveolae - independent mechanisms ( see Section 1 . 8 ) . To resolve which clathrin - independent endocytic pathway is involved in the ChDE internalization of GLUT4 , the susceptibility of GLUT4 internalization to disruption of the caveolar endocytic pathway was determined . This was achieved by depletion of syntaxin - 6 ( SX6 ) using siRNA gene silencing , a strategy recently shown to specifically disrupt caveolar internalization but not other clathrin - dependent or - independent routes of internalization [ 459 ] . Syntaxin - 6 is required for the delivery of GM - 1 to the plasma membrane , which is in turn required for caveolar internalization [ 459 ] . Treating L6 myoblasts with either one of two distinct siRNA sequences to SX6 ( SX6 - 1 and SX6 - 2 ) resulted in reductions of 60 ± 7 % and 53 ± 10 % ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 6 ) in SX6 expression , respectively , relative to the levels in cells treated with non - related ( NR ) siRNA ( Figure 52A ) . 186 Depletion of SX6 caused a significant drop in the internalization of lactosyl ceramide , a known marker [ 455 , 458 ] of caveolar endocytosis when measured for 5 min ( data not shown ) or 15 min ( Figure 52B , C ) . However , GLUT4 internalization was not affected by perturbation of caveolar internalization with this strategy ( Figure 52D ) . These results suggest that the ChDE portion of GLUT4 internalization is not dependent on caveolae . Figure 52 . Syntaxin - 6 gene silencing disrupts lactosyl - ceramide but not GLUT4 myc endocytosis . A . Syntaxin - 6 ( SX6 ) gene ablation .

The fraction of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization in L6 myoblasts transfected with either NR , SX6 - 1 or SX6 - 2 siRNA was determined and shown are the means ± SE , representative of 5 independent experiments . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 187 To confirm these results by a different method , caveolar internalization was disrupted by transient expression of interfering mutants of caveolin - 1 . Expression of the phospho - mimetic mutant of caveolin - 1 ( S80E ) , which causes retention of caveolin molecules in the ER , thereby preventing formation of cell surface caveolae [ 695 ] , but not of wild - type or S80A mutant ( cannot be phosphorylated ) caveolin - 1 , diminished lactosyl ceramide internalization ( Figure 53A and C ) . Consistent with the results obtained with SX6 siRNA , neither expression of wild - type , S80E or S80A mutants of caveolin - 1 altered GLUT4 internalization measured by the single cell assay ( Figure 53B and D , showing the amount of GLUT4 internalized in 5 min as percent of that internalized in untransfected myoblasts ) . Moreover , when the CME component of GLUT4 myc internalization was inhibited by treatment of cells with hypertonic sucrose , the remaining GLUT4 myc internalization remained unaffected by additionally expressing Cav1 - S80E ( Figure 53B and D ) . This demonstrates that compensation of GLUT4 internalization by CME is not a possible explanation for a lack of inhibition of GLUT4 internalization observed following caveolae disruption . Consistent with these results , expression of caveolin - 1 mutants did not affect GLUT4 myc internalization when measured for 2 min , a time point where less GLUT4 has internalized ( data not shown ) . Moreover , the steady - state levels of cell surface GLUT4 myc were unaffected by expression of Cav1 - WT , S80E or S80A ( 1 . 02 ± 0 . 07 , 1 . 09 ± 0 . 09 , 0 . 90 ± 0 . 13 fold relative to untransfected cells , respectively , n = 6 ) . In addition , the surface distribution of GLUT4 was compared with that of endogenous caveolin - 1 . As shown in Figure 54 , cell surface GLUT4 myc and caveolin - 1 exhibited virtually no co - localization . In contrast , cell surface GLUT4 myc exhibited significant colocalization with clathrin light chain ( CLC ) fused to GFP . These results support the observation made by functional interference with caveolae in Figure 52 and Figure 53 , that ChDE GLUT4 internalization is independent of caveolae . 188 189 Figure 53 .

Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 191 Hence , GLUT4 internalization occurs via both CME and a cholesterol - dependent , but clathrin - and caveolae - independent mechanism . In contrast to both CME and caveolae - mediated endocytosis , which require participation of the GTPase dynamin , clathrin - and caveolar - independent internalization pathways can either be dynamin - dependent , as in the case of IL - 2R β endocytosis [ 484 ] , or dynamin - independent , as in the case of GPI - anchored proteins [ 500 ] and flotillin - 1 [ 488 ] . Thus , to understand the mechanism of ChDE of GLUT4 , it is important to determine whether it requires dynamin . Confirming the results of the population - based assay , the single - cell method of measurement of GLUT4 internalization revealed that cholesterol depletion or hypertonic medium only partly inhibited endocytosis of GLUT4 ( by 46 ± 14 % and 57 ± 8 % , respectively ) , and , importantly , their inhibitory effects were additive ( 89 ± 5 % inhibition when used together , Figure 55B ) . Note that in Figure 55B , the amount of GLUT4 internalized in 5 min is expressed as a percent of that internalized in untransfected myoblasts . Interestingly , expression of a mutant of dynamin - 2 ( Dyn2 - K44A ) that exhibits markedly reduced binding and hydrolysis of GTP and thereby largely exists in the GDP - bound state [ 705 ] fully precluded GLUT4 myc internalization ( 92 ± 3 % inhibition , figure 5A & B ) . The inhibition of GLUT4 internalization by Dyn2 - K44A was significantly greater ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 3 ) than that achieved by hypertonic sucrose and cholesterol depletion used separately , and similar to that achieved by the combination of these treatments , when both CME and ChDE routes of GLUT4 myc internalization are inhibited . This result suggests that dynamin is required for both CME and ChDE portions of GLUT4 internalization . In addition , we examined the localization of cell surface GLUT4 myc relative to dynamin - 2 and CLC - GFP ( Figure 56 ) . Co - localization of cell surface GLUT4 myc and dynamin - 2 was observed in puncta devoid of clathrin . Taken together , these observations suggest that both the CME and ChDE components of GLUT4 internalization require dynamin , and that the latter is not mediated by caveolae . 192 Figure 55 .

In order to identify areas of GLUT4 myc containing dynamin - 2 but lacking clathrin , a merged image of ( i ) and ( ii ) above was generated . Areas containing both GLUT4 and clathrin were assigned a red color , and areas containing both GLUT4 and dynamin were assigned a green color . The merged image shown in ( iii ) identifies in areas of GLUT4 and dynamin devoid of clathrin as green , and areas containing all three proteins as yellow . Scale bar 10 μ m . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 194 Previous studies have proposed that the N - terminal 5 FQQI 8 and C - terminal 489 LL 490 domains in mammalian GLUT4 are necessary for its rapid endocytosis in adipocytes and L6 myoblasts [ 284 , 642 , 647 ] . GLUT4 from brown trout ( Salmo trutta , bt - GLUT4 ) lacks the C - terminal di - leucine and expresses a modified N - terminal internalization motif ( FQHL , see Section 4 . 1 ) . Interestingly , the rate of internalization of bt - GLUT4 myc is similar to that of rat GLUT4 when both are stably expressed in L6 myoblasts ( Figure 39 ) . That rat GLUT4 internalizes simultaneously through both CME and ChDE mechanisms lead to the hypothesis bt - GLUT4 myc may not be recognized by a certain set of endocytic adaptors and as such may internalize uniquely through one of the two routes of GLUT4 endocytosis . Since the steady - state levels of bt - GLUT4 myc were unaffected by hypertonic treatment ( Figure 38 ) , it seems likely that bt - GLUT4 myc does not employ CME . Accordingly , bt - GLUT4 internalization was insensitive to hypertonic sucrose but was markedly reduced by cholesterol depletion ( Figure 57A ) . Moreover , depletion of CHC was without effect on bt - GLUT4 internalization ( Figure 57B ) . These results suggest that bt - GLUT4 myc only internalizes through ChDE in L6 myoblasts , unlike rat GLUT4 myc , which partitions through both CME and ChDE in the same cellular background . Given the similar overall rate of endocytosis of both transporters , it appears that a larger proportion of bt - GLUT4 myc internalizes through ChDE compared to rat GLUT4 myc . 195 Figure 57 . Internalization of GLUT4 from brown trout ( bt - GLUT4 myc ) is sensitive to mild cholesterol depletion but is insensitive to perturbation of CME . A . L6 myoblasts stably expressing bt - GLUT4 myc were treated with either 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose for 30 min or 3 mM M β CD for 1 h , and subsequently the fraction of bt - GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization was determined . Shown are the means ± SE of 8 to 20 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control condition . B . The fraction of bt - GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization in L6 myoblasts transfected with either NR , CHC1 or CHC2 siRNA was determined and shown are the means ± SE representative of 4 independent experiments . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 In addition , bt - GLUT4 myc internalization was insensitive to expression of Cav1 - WT or Cav1 - S80E mutants ( Figure 58 ) , as was the amount of steady - state cell surface bt - GLUT4 myc ( 1 . 16 ± 0 . 07 , 1 . 11 ± 0 . 14 , fold relative to untransfected cells , respectively , n = 3 ) . These results further support the conclusion that ChDE of GLUT4 is caveolae - independent . 196 Figure 58 . Internalization of GLUT4 from brown trout ( bt - GLUT4myc ) is insensitive to expression of dominant interfering caveoalin - 1 mutant . L6 - bt - GLUT4myc myoblasts were transfected with a 5 : 1 molar ratio of either cDNA encoding either wild - type caveolin - 1 ( Cav1WT ) or S80E mutant ( Cav1 - S80E ) , or left untransfected ( UTF ) , as indicated . Bt - GLUT4 myc endocytosis was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy , and the fraction of bt - GLUT4 myc internalized in 5 min was normalized to that in UTF cells . Shown are the means ± SE of 3 independent experiments of the normalized bt - GLUT4 myc internalization . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 Taken together , these results show that rat - GLUT4 internalization occurs simultaneously through CME as well as a clathrin - and caveolae - independent , yet dynamin - and cholesterol - dependent endocytic mechanism ( ChDE ) . That bt - GLUT4 has the same functional requirements as the ChDE portion of rat - GLUT4 myc suggests that bt - GLUT4 myc is restricted to internalization through a subset of mammalian GLUT4 endocytic structures , namely ChDE . However , given than many forms of ChDE exist ( see Section 1 . 8 ) , it is also possible that bt - GLUT4 and rat - GLUT4 internalize through different ChDE structures with similar functional requirements . To address this possibility , the localization of bt - GLUT4 myc relative to transiently expressed rat - GLUT4 - HA was determined . To restrict the analysis to transporters immediately after they have internalized , cell surface GLUT4s were labeled with anti - myc and anti - HA antibodies at 4C , followed by subsequent re - warming at 37C for 5 min , similar to the internalization assay . However , for this experiment , antibodies remaining at the cell surface following the re - warming were removed by acid - stripping intact cells . This step allows 197 maintenance of the antibody only on the recently internalized antibody - GLUT4 complexes , which was subsequently detected following permeabilization . As can be seen in Figure 59 , rat - GLUT4 - HA colocalized extensively with rat - GLUT4 myc , whereas partial yet remarkable co - localization was observed with bt - GLUT4 myc . The lesser co - localization observed between bt - GLUT4 myc and rat - GLUT4 - HA than between the two rat transporters likely reflects the partial CME - dependent internalization of rat - GLUT4 myc , but not bt - GLUT4 myc . These results suggest that bt - and rat - GLUT4 share a ChDE internalization pathway . Figure 59 . Immediately after internalization , bt - GLUT4 myc colocalizes in part with rat - GLUT4 - HA . L6 - rat - GLUT4 myc or L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc myoblasts were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding rat - GLUT4 - HA , and subsequently , following serum starvation , GLUT4 myc and GLUT4 - HA internalized from the cell surface within either t = 0 ( control ) or 5 min time period were detected as described in Section 5 . 2 . Shown are representative images obtained by confocal microscopy of single z - sections focusing at the bottom of the cells . Also shown are similar images obtained in cells devoid of GLUT4 myc and GLUT4 - HA as a control for specificity of initial antibody labeling ( L6 - WT , UTF ) . Scale 10 μ m . 198 In addition to the ChDE internalization of GLUT4 described here , other cargos undergo clathrin - and caveolae - independent , yet dynamin dependent internalization ( see Section 1 . 8 ) . In particular , internalization the β subunit of IL - 2R is clathrin - and caveolae - independent but dynamin - dependent [ 459 , 484 ] , in a manner independent of ligand or additional IL - 2R subunits [ 706 ] , reminiscent of the ChDE of GLUT4 shown above . To determine if GLUT4 myc and IL - 2R β share a ChDE route of internalization , IL - 2R β was transiently expressed in L6 myoblasts , and a similar experiment to monitor co - localization of internalizing cargos was performed as described above for bt - and rat - GLUT4 . As can be seen in Figure 60 , rat - GLUT4 myc exhibited partial co - localization with IL2R β after 5 min of internalization . These results suggest GLUT4 and IL2R β share a ChDE internalization pathway . Again , that incomplete co - localization was observed between GLUT4 myc and IL2R β is likely indicative of the partial CME - dependent internalization of rat - GLUT4 myc , but not IL2R β . Figure 60 . Immediately after internalization , GLUT4 myc and IL - 2R β partially colocalize L6 - rat - GLUT4 myc myoblasts were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding IL - 2R β , and subsequently , following serum starvation , GLUT4 myc and IL - 2R β internalized from the cell surface within either t = 0 ( control ) or 5 min time period were detected as described in Section 5 . 2 . Shown are representative images obtained by confocal microscopy of single z - sections focusing at the bottom of the cells . Also shown are similar images obtained in cells that were not acid stripped , as indicated . Scale 10 μ m . 199 Insulin does not regulate GLUT4 internalization rate or route employed Insulin increases the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface at the expense of intracellular GLUT4 , largely through an increase in the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis ( see Section 1 . 6 ) . Consistent with earlier observations that the fraction of GLUT4 myc internalized is similar in the presence of insulin as following its removal [ 688 ] , GLUT4 myc internalization in insulin - stimulated cells occurred at a rate indistinguishable from that in unstimulated cells ( Figure 61 ) . In addition , GLUT4 myc internalization in differentiated myotubes was unaffected by insulin ( Figure 51B ) . In addition to increasing GLUT4 exocytosis , insulin also accelerates intra - endosomal membrane traffic of GLUT4 . As the hormone may regulate membrane sorting of GLUT4 in this manner , it is conceivable that insulin might act to shift the use of endocytic routes employed by GLUT4 , without a detectable effect on the net GLUT4 internalization rate . However , an acute insulin stimulation ( 20 min ) immediately before and during measurement of GLUT4 internalization did not alter the proportion of GLUT4 that internalized in cells also pre - treated with hypertonic medium ( Figure 61B ) , M β CD ( Figure 61C ) , or siRNA to CHC ( Figure 61D ) . The results are shown normalized to the internalization observed in basal or NR - siRNA treated cells , as appropriate . Importantly , siRNA gene silencing of CHC did not perturb insulin phosphorylation of Akt ( data not shown ) . These findings indicate that insulin does not regulate the rate or route of GLUT4 internalization in myoblasts , unlike the case in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 643 ] . 200 Figure 61 . Insulin does not change the rate of GLUT4 myc internalization , its sensitivity to cholesterol depletion or inhibition of CME . A .

L6 myoblasts were either left untreated or treated with 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose ( B ) , 3 mM M β CD ( C ) or transfected with either NR or CHC1 siRNA ( D ) , and subsequently left untreated ( basal ) or treated with 100 nM insulin for 20 min . The fraction GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization in L6 myoblasts was determined . Percent Endocytosis : the fraction of GLUT4 myc internalized in treated or CHC1 - transfected conditions is expressed as percent of the fraction internalized in basal and / or NR siRNA transfected cells , as appropriate , at each time point .

Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 201 Mitochondrial uncoupling reduces the rate of GLUT4 internalization Mitochondrial uncouplers increase the steady - state levels of surface GLUT4 in myocytes [ 686 ] , skeletal muscle [ 541 ] and adipocytes [ 383 , 554 ] , likely by inducing an adaptive reaction that promotes ATP synthesis through anaerobic glycolysis [ 366 ] . The precise mechanisms involved in such adaptive GLUT4 traffic are unknown , however treatment with oligomycin , an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation , retarded GLUT4 internalization in rat cardiomyocytes [ 383 ] . Note that perturbation of mitochondrial function in L6 myoblasts by DNP does not result in the same level ATP depletion ( ~ 50 % reduction after 15 min , [ ATP ] recovers to 100 % after < 1 h [ 366 ] ) as observed in cells treated with azide and high concentrations of 2 - deoxyglucose ( ~ 3 - 5 % remaining , no recovery of [ ATP ] [ 707 ] ) . The latter results in halting of all ATP - and GTP - dependent cellular processes . It is likely that in cells treated with DNP alone , increased glucose transport through GLUT4 results in increased glucose flux through glycolysis , thereby leading to a full recovery of intracellular [ ATP ] . Whereas both inhibition of the oxidative chain and mitochondrial uncoupling change the energy charge of the cell , they differently affect the redox state [ 366 ] . To determine whether mitochondrial uncoupling affects the endocytic rate of GLUT4 , L6 myoblasts were exposed to 0 . 5 mM 2 , 4 - dinitrophenol ( DNP ) for 30 min , followed by measurement of GLUT4 internalization in the continued presence of the uncoupling agent . DNP reduced the rate of GLUT4 internalization ( Figure 62A ) . To determine if DNP preferentially affects CME or ChDE of GLUT4 , we examined if its effect was additive to that of treatment with hypertonic medium or cholesterol depletion . The fraction of rat GLUT4 myc internalized in cells treated with DNP , hypertonic medium or M β CD , alone or in combination , was normalized to that in untreated cells ( Figure 62B ) . Interestingly , the combined effects of DNP and hypertonic medium were significantly greater than those of each treatment alone ( Figure 62B , panel i ) , whereas there was no additive effect of cholesterol depletion and DNP ( Figure 62B ) . These results suggest that DNP reduces the rate of GLUT4 internalization by inhibiting GLUT4 entry via the ChDE . 202 Figure 62 . DNP retards GLUT4 myc internalization through the cholesterol - sensitive pathway . A . The fraction of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization at 22C in L6 myoblasts untreated or treated with 0 . 5 mM 2 , 4 - dinitrophenol ( DNP ) for 20 min was determined and shown are the means ± SE of 14 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control condition . B . L6 myoblasts were either left untreated or treated with 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose ( i ) or , 3 mM M β CD ( ii ) and subsequently left untreated ( basal ) or treated with 0 . 5 mM DNP for 20 min . The fraction of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization at 22C in L6 myoblasts was determined . Percent Endocytosis : the fraction of GLUT4 myc internalized in treated conditions is expressed as percent of the fraction internalized in basal cells at each time point . Shown are means ± SE of 9 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 . For panel B , dashed lines represent GLUT4 myc internalization in untreated cells . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 203 We then examined whether the retardation of GLUT4 internalization may be elicited by other agents that reduce intracellular [ ATP ] . Oligomycin and azide perturb the mitochondrial ATPase and complex IV of the electron transport chain , respectively , and these agents also reduced GLUT4 internalization at 2 minutes of re - warming ( Figure 63 ) . That DNP had a larger effect on GLUT4 internalization than oligomycin and azide may reflect more pronounced inhibition of mitochondrial function . Figure 63 . Oligomycin and azide reduce GLUT4 myc internalization . Following serum starvation , L6 myoblasts were treated with 10 μ M oligomycin for 1 h or 10 mM NaN 4 for 20 min , or left untreated ( control ) , as indicated , after which GLUT4 internalization was measured in the continued presence or absence of the drugs . Shown are the means of 4 independent experiments of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization ± SE . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control . Since the DNP - induced signals leading to the gain in surface GLUT4 in L6 myoblasts include AMPK [ 345 ] and PKC [ 686 ] , but not signals typically activated by insulin ( See Section 1 . 7 , [ 686 ] ) , we explored whether stimuli that separately activate each of these kinase pathways could replicate the effect of DNP on GLUT4 internalization . Treatment with 2 mM AICAR for 2 h ( to stimulate AMPK ) or with 1 μ M PMA for 20 min ( to stimulate PKC ) each elicited an 204 increase in cell surface GLUT4 ( [ 25 ] and data not shown ) , but neither stimulus alone affected the rate of GLUT4 internalization ( Figure 64 ) . Interestingly , the combined stimulation of L6 myoblasts with AICAR and PMA resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of GLUT4 internalization . This result suggests that the dampening effect of DNP on GLUT4 internalization may be due to the simultaneous activation of AMPK and PKC ( see Figure 64 , right panel for diagram depicting signaling scheme ) . Figure 64 . Simultaneous activation of AMPK and DNP is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of GLUT4 internalization . The fraction of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization at 22C in L6 myoblasts untreated or treated with 2 μΜ AICAR ( 2 h ) , 1 μ M PMA ( 30 min ) alone or in combination were determined and shown are the means ± SE of 5 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control condition . Shown on the right is a diagram depicting the parallel signaling pathways that are necessary and sufficient for regulating GLUT4 endocytosis via ChDE . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 The slower internalization of GLUT4 elicited by DNP was brought about through a selective reduction of its endocytosis through ChDE . To explore whether this is a particular characteristic of GLUT4 or may represent a more general effect of DNP on ChDE , we examined the effect of DNP on the internalization of other cargo molecules known to engage either CME or ChDE . Consistent with the interpretation that DNP does not perturb GLUT4 internalization 205 through CME , DNP treatment did not affect Tf internalization ( Figure 65A ) . Moreover , internalization of bt - GLUT4 myc , which occurs only through ChDE , was reduced by treatment with DNP ( Figure 65B ) . However , there are extensive sequence similarities between rat - and bt - GLUT4 myc outside of the putative clathrin adaptor binding motifs ( Figure 36 ) , and thus this result does not address the possibility that DNP acts by specific modulation of the transporter and not the entire ChDE route . Accordingly , the effect of DNP on the internalization of IL2R β was examined . Following transient transfection of IL - 2R β in L6 myoblasts , we measured its internalization in single cells by methods analogous to those used for Tf and GLUT4 . Internalization for 5 min was chosen to measure IL - 2R β endocytosis for consistency with GLUT4 internalization assays . The fraction of surface labeled IL - 2R β remaining at the cell surface following 5 min of internalization was 0 . 65 ± 0 . 06 in the basal state . This significant ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 4 ) internalization of Il2R β was slightly slower than that of Tf ( see Figure 47 & Figure 48 ) in L6 cells but is similar to the behavior of both proteins in HeLa cells [ 484 ] . Also consistent with previous studies [ 484 ] , IL - 2R β internalization in L6 myoblasts was insensitive to clathrin disruption by hypertonic medium , and was instead acutely sensitive to cholesterol depletion by M β CD ( Figure 65C ) . This result confirms that IL2R β internalization in L6 myoblasts occurs by a ChDE mechanism as previously reported in HeLa and immune system cells [ 484 ] . Of note , however , bt - GLUT4 myc internalization , which occurs entirely through ChDE , was faster than that of IL - 2R β in L6 myoblasts . Thus , although GLUT4 myc and IL - 2R β internalize via the same ChDE ( Figure 60 ) , there may be differences in how each protein interacts with the machinery of this endocytic route . Most importantly , IL2R β internalization was also significantly reduced by DNP ( Figure 65C ) . Note that the amount of IL - 2R β internalized in treated cells is expressed as a fraction of the internalization in untreated ( basal ) cells . Therefore , DNP reduced the internalization of two distinct cargo molecules ( GLUT4 and IL2R β ) that rely on a similar type ChDE for internalization . 206 Figure 65 . DNP reduces internalization of markers of clathrin - and caveolae - independent and dynamin - dependent endocytosis but is without effect on Tf internalization . The fraction of Tf ( A ) or bt - GLUT4 myc ( B ) remaining at the cell surface at various times of internalization at 22C in L6 myoblasts untreated or treated 0 . 5 mM DNP for 20 min was determined and shown are the means ± SE of 4 to 5 independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 , relative to control condition . C . L6 myoblasts were transfected with cDNA encoding IL2R β and subsequently treated with either 3 mM M β CD ( 1 h ) , 450 mM ( hypertonic ) sucrose ( 30 min ) , 0 . 5 mM 2 , 4 - dinitophenol DNP ( 20 min ) . The fraction of IL2R β internalized in 5 min was normalized to that in untreated cells ( means ± SE of 4 independent experiments of the normalized GLUT4 myc internalization ) . * p < 0 . 01 , relative to untreated condition . Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 207 In addition , other stimuli lead to an increase in cell surface GLUT4 by yet poorly characterized mechanisms . Treatment of L6 muscle cells with the cytokine Tumour Necrosis Factor - α ( TNF α ) for 24 h leads to an increase in steady - state cell surface levels of GLUT4 myc [ 550 ] in a manner blocked by inhibitors of NF κ B ( Bay 11 - 7082 ) and p38MAPK ( SB220025 ) . Treatment of L6 myoblasts for 24 h with TNF α did not affect the rate of GLUT4 myc internalization ( Figure 66 ) , implying that the cytokine acts by increasing GLUT4 exocytosis . Figure 66 . TNF α does not affect the rate of GLUT4 myc internalization . L6 myoblasts were incubated in a - MEM containing 0 . 1 % FBS alone ( basal ) or supplemented with 10 ng / mL TNF α , for 24h , and then GLUT4 myc internalization was measured by population - based assay . Shown are the means of 5 independent experiments of the fraction of GLUT4 myc remaining at the cell surface at various times ± SE . Possible contribution of GLUT4myc overexpression The expression level of GLUT4 myc in the L6 - GLUT4 myc cell line is not higher than that of endogenous GLUT4 in mature adipocytes or skeletal muscle . Nonetheless , we sought to determine if the level of expression of the transporter might influence the routes of GLUT4 internalization observed . Indeed , internalization routes may saturate by increased cargo 208 expression [ 708 ] . To explore this possibility , wild - type L6 myoblasts ( WT - L6 ; not expressing GLUT4 myc ) were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding GLUT4 myc - eGFP . This resulted in a wide range of expression levels of GLUT4 myc - eGFP , evidenced by eGFP fluorescence intensities . By labeling permeabilized cells with anti - myc antibodies followed by Cy3 - coupled secondary antibodies , the eGFP fluorescence intensity corresponding to the amount of GLUT4 myc - GFP transiently expressed was related to the amount of GLUT4 myc expressed in the stably transfected L6 - GLUT4 myc cell line ( data not shown ) . The ratio of surface to total GLUT4 myc - eGFP was then determined over a wide range of expression levels . These values were calculated in untreated cells or cells stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 20 min . A representative plot of Cy3 - labeled surface GLUT4 myc intensity versus eGFP fluorescence intensity in individual cells under basal and insulin - stimulated conditions is shown in Figure 67A . The results were then grouped into five ranges of GLUT4 myc - eGFP expression levels , relative to the level in the stably transfected L6 - GLUT4 myc cell line ( Figure 67B ) . The steady - state proportion of surface vs total GLUT4 myc was stable over a 10 - fold range of expression levels . Further , insulin doubled the steady - state levels of surface GLUT4 for up to a 6 - fold range of expression levels above that of the stable L6 - GLUT4 myc cell line . Next , we assessed the fraction of anti - myc - antibody remaining at the cell surface , normalized to GFP intensity , following 5 min of internalization in WT - L6 myoblasts transiently transfected with GLUT4 myc - eGFP . Following similar grouping by level of expression of GLUT4 myc - eGFP as Figure 67B , the fraction of GLUT4 myc - eGFP internalized was unchanged within a range of GLUT4 myc expression 6 - fold above that of the L6 - GLUT4 myc cell line ( Figure 67C compared to Figure 47 & Figure 55 ) . Moreover , both M β CD and hypertonic sucrose inhibited GLUT4 myc - eGFP internalization over this range of expression ( Figure 67D ) , and the level of inhibition was similar to that in the L6 - GLUT4 myc cell line ( Figure 55 ) . We conclude that the observed CME and ChDE internalization routes of GLUT4 are not the result of overflow of either endocytic route . 209 Figure 67 .

Reproduced with permission from Traffic ( 2008 ) 9 : 1173 - 90 210 5 . 4 Discussion and conclusions Routes of GLUT4 endocytosis The results described herein suggest that GLUT4 internalization in myocytes occurs through at least two pathways : a clathrin - dependent route and a clathrin - and caveolae - independent one ( see Figure 68 for model ) . The main observations leading to this conclusion are as follows : a ) Two strategies that inhibit CME , hypertonic sucrose and CHC gene silencing , reduced GLUT4 internalization far less than the reduction they exerted on internalization of Tf , a known marker of CME . Importantly , inhibition of GLUT4 myc internalization by siRNA to CHC was reversed in cells expressing GFP - CHC , demonstrating specificity of both siRNAs to CHC for disruption of CME . Moreover , cell surface GLUT4 myc co - localized with clathrin light chain but not with caveolin - 1 . These results add to previous reports supporting GLUT4 internalization through CME in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 691 , 692 ] , rat adipocytes [ 690 ] and L6 myoblasts [ 688 ] by demonstrating a concomitant and significant clathrin - independent internalization of GLUT4 . b ) A significant proportion of GLUT4 internalization was also sensitive to depletion of membrane cholesterol by 3 mM M β CD , which spared Tf internalization ( Figure 50 ) . The inhibition of GLUT4 internalization provoked by 3 mM M β CD was additive to that achieved upon disruption of CME by hypertonic sucrose ( Figure 55 ) or CHC siRNA ( Figure 50 ) , confirming that at this concentration M β CD does not affect CME . In addition , bt - GLUT4 , a natural variant of GLUT4 found in fish which lacks motifs important for GLUT4 endocytosis by CME internalized selectively through the clathrin - independent but cholesterol - sensitive route . The fact that the separate inhibition of CME or ChDE reduced the net amount of GLUT4 internalized suggests that each route is rather independent , and GLUT4 at the membrane does not spill into a pathway when the other is perturbed . These results argue against a plasticity of 211 GLUT4 internalization that would allow it to utilize either route indistinctly . Instead , they suggest that distinct adaptor molecules may segregate GLUT4 into functionally distinct domains destined to internalize through distinct routes . Perturbing CME through clathrin knockdown or hypertonic medium would not prevent the association of GLUT4 with adaptor molecules such as AP - 2 , which may effectively sequester a population of GLUT4 at the membrane , rendering it unavailable to other routes of internalization . Importantly , AP - 2 remains associated in puncta within the plasma membrane upon depletion of clathrin [ 701 ] . Contrary to disruption of clathrin itself , targeting endocytic adaptor molecules such as AP - 2 may fail to reveal the participation of that particular endocytic mechanism when there are alternative endocytic routes or alternative adaptors for a particular cargo . We surmise that bt - GLUT4 , unable to associate with clathrin adaptor AP - 2 due to differences in both 5 FQQI 8 and 489 LL 490 putative clathrin adaptor recognition motifs , is therefore insensitive to clathrin knockdown and instead resorts to the ChDE pathway , which in this case can accommodate the entire cohort of surface transporter available for internalization , effectively internalizing at the same rate as the rat GLUT4 myc . Moreover , this concept may explain , at least in part , the reduction in GLUT4 internalization observed upon CHC depletion ( this study ) compared to the lack of effect of AP - 2 knockdown on GLUT4 endocytosis in the basal state observed in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 643 ] . It is conceivable that AP - 2 knockdown frees up all GLUT4 to internalize via the cholesterol - sensitive route . The cholesterol - dependent endocytic route ( ChDE ) ChDE likely involves organization of cargo into cholesterol - rich , lipid - ordered domains , and include caveolae - mediated internalization as well as at least two other caveolae - independent routes that differ in their requirement for dynamin [ 494 ] . L6 myoblasts express caveolin isoforms 1 , 2 and 3 , and these proteins are required for caveolae formation . The three caveolin isoforms form stable hetero - oligomeric complexes that co - localize in L6 myoblasts [ 451 , 709 ] . Useful strategies to interfere with caveolin function must affect all isoforms . Here we employed gene silencing of syntaxin - 6 , which perturbs the delivery of GM1 to the plasma membrane and thus 212 the assembly of caveolin proteins and function of caveolae , but does not affect other endocytic routes [ 459 ] . As well , we interfered with caveolae through expression a phospho - mimetic ( S80E ) mutant of caveolin - 1 , known to cause retention of both endogenous and exogenous caveolin in the ER [ 695 ] , by virtue of the hetero - oligomerization of caveolin - 1 , - 2 and - 3 . We confirmed disruption of caveolar internalization by both syntaxin - 6 knockdown and expression of caveolin - 1 S80E , by observing a reduction in internalization of lactosyl ceramide , a known marker of caveolar internalization [ 496 ] . Yet , each of these conditions did not affect GLUT4 internalization . Moreover , bt - GLUT4 , which is restricted to ChDE , is unaffected by expression of dominant - interfering caveolin constructs . Also , no change was observed in the steady - state levels of GLUT4 or bt - GLUT4 in cells expressing dominant - interfering caveolin constructs , arguing against a small effect of caveolar perturbation on GLUT4 endocytosis . Consistent with its internalization through caveolae , lactosyl ceramide internalization was strongly reduced by 3 mM M β CD ( data not shown ) . Collectively , these observations show that the ChDE of GLUT4 in myocytes does not rely on the caveolar pathway . In contrast , a previous study in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes showed a small inhibition of GLUT4 internalization upon expression of caveolin S80E [ 695 ] . This difference could be due to the divergence in internalization routes between the two cell lines alluded to above . The extensive presence of caveolae and their unique organization in rosette - like clusters in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 68 ] but not in L6 myocytes ( Figure 54 ) is consistent with this possibility . Recently , Pilch & col . [ 710 ] suggested that caveolae may have the unique function of modulating fatty acid flux across the plasma membrane of adipocytes , a function that may be unique to these cells . In support of the segregation of GLUT4 internalization from caveolae - dependent endocytosis , we found that cell surface GLUT4 myc does not co - localize with caveolin - 1 . This protein is a good marker of caveolae since it strictly colocalizes with caveolin - 2 and - 3 in L6 myocytes [ 451 , 709 ] . Taken together , these results argue that the ChDE of GLUT4 does not occur through caveolae . Consistent with these results in L6 myocytes , caveolin - 1 was not detected on immuno - isolated GLUT4 vesicles from rat skeletal muscle [ 711 ] . Little is currently known about such clathrin - and caveolae - independent internalization pathways , and their protein adaptors and cargo recognition motifs are unknown . It is possible 213 that assembly of proteins into membrane structures for internalization may occur by arrangement within lipid determinants . Consistent with the latter , some studies propose that GLUT4 localizes to lipid rafts at the cell surface of adipose cells [ 712 - 714 ] . However , the requirement for membrane cholesterol could indicate other properties of GLUT4 ChDE , such as the need for negative membrane curvature that cholesterol imparts onto cellular membranes [ 715 ] . The lack of protein coat on pits rich in CME - independent cargo , such as IL - 2R [ 484 ] , could indicate a greater reliance of ChDE on membrane cholesterol for establishing curvature compared to CME . There are at least two functionally distinct routes for the clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytosis of cargo : one that requires the GTPase dynamin and internalizes IL - 2R [ 484 ] and one that is dynamin - independent and internalizes flotillin , cholera toxin and GPI - anchored proteins [ 477 , 488 , 500 ] . Accordingly , the dependence on dynamin can distinguish between these two different clathrin - and caveolae - independent routes of internalization ( in addition to its well known participation in CME ) . The complete inhibition of GLUT4 endocytosis we observed in L6 cells expressing the dynamin - 2 K44A mutant suggests that the clathrin - and caveolae - independent route of GLUT4 internalization requires dynamin . Based on functional requirements , the ChDE portion of GLUT4 internalization may thus resemble that utilized by IL - 2R β [ 484 ] . Immediately following internalization , rat - GLUT4 is found exclusively in puncta dispersed through the cytosol that overlap in part with similar puncta of bt - GLUT4 and IL - 2R β . IL - 2R β remains separate from CME - derived early endosomes , demarked by TfR , at 5 min of internalization , as seen by TX - 100 insolubility of recently internalized IL - 2R β , whereas TfR was completely solubilized under these conditions [ 484 ] . Also , IL - 2R β and TfR were shown to localize to non - overlapping puncta for up to 15 min of internalization in Hep2 β cells [ 486 ] . Thus , the intracellular overlap of GLUT4 myc with IL - 2R β ( Figure 60 ) , and possibly with bt - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 59 ) , immediately following internalization ( t = 5 min ) demonstrates that mammalian GLUT4 internalization by ChDE is not only functionally similar to bt - GLUT4 and IL - 2R β , but that these cargo likely share the same endocytic structures . Future experiments to detect such cargo within endocytic pits at the plasma membrane by immunoelectron microscopy may support this conclusion . 214 Figure 68 . Model of two routes of GLUT4 endocytosis in L6 myoblasts . GLUT4 internalization occurs simultaneously through a clathrin - dependent mechanism , likely together with transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , as well as through a clathrin - and caveolae - independent mechanism that is dependent on dynamin and cholesterol . This latter route is shared with bt - GLUT4 and IL - 2R β , and is regulated by DNP , in a manner where PKC and AMPK activation is necessary and sufficient . Recently , some additional molecular components of ChDE of IL - 2R β have been identified . Using RNA interference and dominant interfering mutants , activation of Pak1 and 2 by Rac1 , in turn leading to phosphorylation of cortactin , is required for internalization of IL - 2R β in Hep2 β cells [ 486 ] . Cortactin may in turn recruit dynamin to these endocytic structures , via its SH3 domain binding the proline - rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin [ 716 , 717 ] . Interestingly , a Rac1 chemical inhibitor elevates cell surface GLUT4 myc in L6 myoblasts ( L . JeBailey and A . Klip , unpublished observations and Section 6 . 2 ) . These results are consistent with a requirement for Rac1 for GLUT4 endocytosis , likely via ChDE shared with IL - 2R β . Also , in 215 preliminary experiments , we found that expression of a inhibitory truncation mutant of cortactin comprising only the SH3 domain slowed down GLUT4 myc internalization in L6 myoblasts ( see Section 6 . 2 ) . Since this retardation was incomplete and cortactin is also involved in CME , it is not possible to conclude that cortactin is involved in ChDE of GLUT4 . Future experiments should examine the effect of simultaneous clathrin and cortactin disruption . However , given that GLUT4 and IL - 2R β co - localize immediately following internalization , it is likely that in addition to dynamin , ChDE of GLUT4 requires Rac1 , Pak1 and / or 2 , cortactin . Regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis The operation of two distinct routes of GLUT4 internalization may afford differential regulation of its endocytosis by different stimuli . While some reports find that insulin decreases the rate of GLUT4 internalization in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 282 , 718 ] and rat adipocytes [ 687 , 719 ] others have found no action of the hormone in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 284 , 720 ] or rat cardiomyocytes [ 383 ] , nor in L6 myocytes upon removal of insulin [ 688 ] . The results presented here show that acute stimulation with the hormone does not regulate the rate of GLUT4 internalization in L6 muscle cells . Moreover , there was no effect of insulin on the fractional dependence of GLUT4 internalization on CME or ChDE . In addition , insulin was without effect on the internalization of Tf or bt - GLUT4 myc in L6 cells ( data not shown ) . A recent study concluded that in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , insulin reduces GLUT4 internalization by inhibiting an AP - 2 - independent , cholesterol - dependent endocytic route , shifting GLUT4 towards an AP - 2 - dependent route [ 643 ] . These observations in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes are consistent with the ability of GLUT4 to internalize through both CME and ChDE . In contrast , the results presented in this Chapter support the notion that , in L6 myoblasts , insulin does not reduce the rate nor change the route of its internalization and hence the rise in surface content of GLUT4 elicited by the hormone is the sole result of enhanced exocytic rate of GLUT4 . Of note , when single exponential decay curve - fitting was applied to GLUT4 internalization data ( not shown ) , the basal rate of GLUT4 internalization in L6 myoblasts was virtually identical to that reported for 3T3 - L1 adipocytes ( 0 . 2 ± 0 . 01 min - 1 , [ 281 ] ) . In L6 myocytes , like in isolated skeletal muscle , insulin 216 causes a 2 to 4 - fold increase in glucose uptake , whereas in 3T3 - L1 and primary rat adipocytes , the increase in glucose uptake is typically greater , commonly around 10 - fold ( see Section 7 , and Table 7 ) . Since insulin - stimulated glucose uptake occurs largely via GLUT4 [ 521 ] , it is possible that the reduction in GLUT4 internalization is particular to adipocytes , thereby achieving a higher fold increase in glucose uptake following insulin treatment . As in L6 myocytes , insulin does not regulate GLUT4 internalization in primary cardiomyocytes [ 383 ] . Possibly , in adipocytes , insulin is able to modulate GLUT4 internalization through caveolae , an endocytic route not employed by GLUT4 in L6 myocytes nor likely in rat skeletal muscle [ 711 ] . Further studies on the effect of insulin on the internalization of GLUT4 in primary skeletal muscle may help to clarify the hypothesis that insulin regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis is adipocyte - specific and does not occur in muscle . Muscle and muscle cells , however , respond to stimuli other than insulin with an increase in cell surface GLUT4 , of physiological implications ( see Section 1 . 7 ) . Membrane depolarization by extracellular potassium treatment , mimicking the depolarization that triggers muscle contraction , caused a retardation of GLUT4 internalization in L6 myotubes [ 345 ] . As well , oligomycin , an agent that disrupts oxidative phosphorylation , decreased the rate of internalization of GLUT4 in rat cardiomyocytes , and it was proposed that this effect is mediated by AMPK [ 383 ] . DNP , an uncoupler of oxidative metabolism , increases cell surface GLUT4 in myoblasts , myotubes , adipocytes and skeletal muscle [ 383 , 541 , 554 , 686 ] . In this Chapter we showed that DNP retards the rate of GLUT4 internalization in L6 myoblasts . Since this effect on GLUT4 internalization is additive to the complete inhibition of CME by hypertonic sucrose and not additive to the effect of M β CD treatment , DNP likely reduces the internalization of GLUT4 through ChDE . Consistent with this interpretation , DNP did not retard the rate of Tf internalization . DNP activates PKC and AMPK , and interference with each of these signaling pathways precludes the DNP - induced increase in cell surface GLUT4 [ 345 , 686 ] , conceivably by preventing DNP - regulation of GLUT4 internalization . Although we found that separate activation of PKC and AMPK caused an increase in the cell surface content of GLUT4 ( data not shown ) , simulation of either kinase alone did not affect the rate of GLUT4 internalization ( Figure 217 64C ) . Interestingly , when L6 myoblasts were treated concomitantly with PMA and AICAR , a significant inhibition of GLUT4 internalization ensued . We have previously shown that inhibition of either PKC by pharmacological approaches [ 345 ] or AMPK by siRNA gene silencing [ 383 ] , fully inhibit the gain in cell surface GLUT4 evoked by DNP . Overall , these results argue that parallel signaling pathways involving PKC and AMPK are necessary and sufficient for the regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis by DNP . Together with the lack of effect of DNP on Tf internalization , these findings suggest that GLUT4 internalization is regulated by activation of protein signaling pathways and is not merely the result of insufficient cellular energy unable to support proper endocytosis . That both azide and oligomycin recapitulate the effect of DNP on regulation of GLUT4 internalization in L6 myoblasts ( Figure 63 ) strengthens the idea that energy stress itself leads to regulation of endocytosis , and not another off - target action of each drug . Importantly , like DNP , azide increases intracellular calcium [ 721 ] , and activates AMPK [ 721 ] , as does oligomycin [ 383 , 722 ] , and thus , like DNP , these inhibitors may regulate GLUT4 internalization via concomitant activation of PKC and AMPK pathways . Moreover , treatment of clone 9 cells with azide resulted in a decrease in intracellular [ ATP ] , increased NADH / NAD + ratio indicative of increased ROS production , activation of AMPK , and increased glucose transport , largely via GLUT1 [ 723 ] . Interestingly , this effect was not affected by N - acetyl - l - cysteine , which counteracts ROS production , but was blunted by siRNA to AMPK α [ 724 ] . Preliminary experiments show that siRNA to CHC does not affect internalization of the housekeeping transporter GLUT1 in L6 myoblasts ( see Section 6 . 2 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that regulation of GLUT internalization following energy crisis may be a conserved mechanism that acts independently of redox effects following perturbation of mitochondria . The molecular mechanism by which GLUT4 internalization through ChDE is regulated by DNP is unknown . Since both GLUT4 and IL - 2R β internalization were slowed down by DNP , this drug likely regulates the entire route of ChDE endocytosis . Regulation of ChDE by DNP may occur through post - translational modification of endocytic components and these modifications may involve modulation of common IL - 2R β - and GLUT4 - binding proteins , a number of which have been recently identified for the latter [ 626 ] . The recently identified 218 requirement for ChDE of IL2R β of Rac - Pak - cortactin signaling pathway provides an intriguing possibility for modulation by DNP [ 486 ] . In conclusion , two separate internalization routes employed by GLUT4 in L6 myocytes were identified , and that , in contrast to 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , insulin is without effect on GLUT4 internalization . However , DNP , which mimics the increased energy demand seen during muscle contraction and exercise , retards GLUT4 internalization , in a process that may involve AMPK and PKC , by inhibition of an entire clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytic route which requires dynamin . Future work that will identify additional components of this endocytic mechanism and their regulation may provide an important therapeutic avenue to bypass insulin resistance , a condition in which insulin - stimulated exocytosis of GLUT4 is impaired . Evolution of GLUT4 endocytic routes The internalization of GLUT4 via two routes , CME and ChDE , implies that the route of internalization may dictate subsequent membrane traffic ( see Section 6 . 3 ) . Consistent with this interpretation , GLUT4 may recycle through two distinct compartments , the recycling endosomes ( GR1 ) and the TGN ( GR2 ) , in addition to the insulin - responsive GSVs ( Chapter 4 ) . Since bt - GLUT4 myc is restricted to ChDE and GR2 , an interesting possibility is that these two are functionally linked , as are CME and GR1 . As an extension of what was first proposed in Chapter 4 , ChDE linking to GR2 may be a more evolutionarily ancient membrane traffic route employed by GLUT4 than CME linking to GR1 . In support of this , the 5 FQQI 8 motif of GLUT4 that may target GLUT4 to CME deviates substantially from the consensus YXXØ ( Y , tyrosine ; X , any amino acid ; Ø , bulky hydrophobic residue ) , and binding of a peptide corresponding to the N - terminus of GLUT4 to adaptins µ1 and µ2 was increased dramatically upon introduction of a F5Y mutation [ 642 ] . Moreover , introduction of F5Y into full - length GLUT4 increased the rate of GLUT4 internalization [ 725 ] . Hence , the 5 FQQI 8 motif of GLUT4 may represent a more recently evolved motif , reflective of possible selective pressure to enhance insulin responsiveness of GLUT4 as a result of internalization through CME ( see Chapter 4 ) . However , as energy - depletion stress , and perhaps muscle contraction regulate GLUT4 by inhibition of ChDE , 219 additional selective pressure may ensure that these two distinct routes of GLUT4 internalization are preserved in order also facilitate more ancient regulatory mechanisms . Hence , by internalizing through both CME and ChDE , GLUT4 may acquire enhanced insulin sensitivity resulting from use of CME - GR1 as well as regulation by energy stress and muscle contraction via inhibition of ChDE . 220 Chapter 6 6 Overall Perspective and Future Directions All results presented in this Chapter are from experiments performed by Costin N . Antonescu 221 The results presented in this Thesis show that , in addition to exocytosis , the intrinsic activity and internalization of GLUT4 are subject to regulation . The signaling mechanism linking an activated insulin receptor to increased GLUT4 activity is unknown , but does not involve p38MAPK ( Chapter 2 ) . Insulin results in conformation changes in GLUT4 ( deduced from its susceptibility to affinity photolabeling ) , providing a possible basis for increasing glucose transport turnover . In order to understand the regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity , future experiments are proposed below to clarify the signaling mechanism and structural requirements for regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity ( Section 6 . 1 ) . GLUT4 internalization occurs simultaneously through both CME - dependent and – independent ( ChDE ) mechanisms . The CME - independent route has been defined on the basis of cholesterol - and dynamin dependence ( Chapter 5 ) . The identities of other components of this pathway remain to be determined , and experiments are proposed in Section 6 . 2 to address this question . Related to probing of the components of ChDE of GLUT4 is the question of the consequence of GLUT4 internalization route on its subsequent intracellular membrane traffic . This is discussed in Section 6 . 3 . Although insulin stimulation did not affect GLUT4 internalization , mitochondrial depolarization , which elicits signals similar to muscle contraction , retarded GLUT4 internalization via ChDE . Activation of PKC and AMPK was necessary and sufficient for this process . Moreover , as insulin resistance and obesity are associated with defects in insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis , inhibition of internalization of transporter represents an attractive drug strategy to increase cell surface GLUT4 and glucose uptake in muscle . This possibility is described in Section 6 . 4 . 6 . 1 GLUT4 activation As discussed in Chapter 2 , modulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity is likely to involve changes in the conformation or conformational flexibility of the transporter . Hence , 222 understanding the structural changes in GLUT4 elicited by insulin would be very revealing for the mechanism of GLUT4 activation . Importantly , the identity of the signaling mechanism linking the activated insulin receptor to regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity is currently lacking . As such , examination of this phenomenon in vitro , either by structural analysis such as cryo - EM or atomic force microscopy , or by reconstituted transport assays , is not feasible until such signals have been identified and can be introduced to purified GLUT4 in vitro . Hence , one option for elucidating the mechanism of insulin - stimulated GLUT4 activation in cells is to perform an siRNA screen in L6 myoblasts , and determine which proteins , when silenced , result in decreased 2 - deoxyglucose uptake , yet do not prevent the gain in cell surface GLUT4 myc upon insulin stimulation . Focusing the siRNA screen on kinases may help to initially limit its scope . Identification of signal transduction components involved in insulin - stimulated regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activation may allow reconstitution of the GLUT4 activation process in vitro using purified proteins , thereby allowing some of the structural analysis described above . There are however , possibilities for probing changes in GLUT4 structure in cells following insulin stimulation . GLUT4 activation may be linked to homo - oligomerization , as has been suggested to regulate the turnover of GLUT1 . Thus , transfection of HA - tagged GLUT4 into L6 - GLUT4 myc cells , followed by immunoprecipitation of the myc - epitope may reveal a change in bound HA - tagged GLUT4 following insulin stimulation . It is also possible that GLUT4 activity is regulated by binding or unbinding to cytosolic proteins , a process that may be linked to the C - terminal epitope unmasking of the transporter ( Section 2 . 3 ) . A recent study has identified numerous GLUT4 binding proteins that exhibit altered interaction with the transporter after stimulation with insulin [ 626 ] . Interestingly , hexokinase II binding to GLUT4 may decrease GLUT4 turnover and photolabeling of the exofacial glucose binding site ( H . Zaid and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) . Furthermore , insulin decreases this interaction [ 626 ] , consistent with a possible role for hexokinase II in insulin - stimulated regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity . Further study of hexokinase II and other possible GLUT4 interactors may confirm the hypothesis that protein - protein interaction with an endofacial part of GLUT4 regulates GLUT4 intrinsic activity . 223 In addition to binding proteins , GLUT4 may exhibit altered intrinsic activation as a result of partitioning within particular lipid microdomains . In support of this hypothesis , in adipocytes , the arrival of GLUT4 in a PM fraction following insulin stimulation was insufficient to stimulate glucose uptake ; the increase in glucose uptake correlated with a subsequent appearance of GLUT4 within a caveolae - rich fraction of the PM [ 726 ] . It remains to be determined whether this relocalization of GLUT4 into PM lipid microdomains occurs in L6 myocytes , cells in which GLUT4 does not localize to caveolae . Moreover , it is possible that this “activating” membrane microdomain may be linked to internalization via ChDE , as this process likely involves GLUT4 partitioning into detergent - resistant membranes ( DRMs ) . In such a model , it may be possible that GLUT4 becomes activated at the plasma membrane in a manner that would normally result in its imminent endocytosis via ChDE . Adipocytes would solve this conundrum by separately slowing down GLUT4 endocytosis through this route . As such , preventing GLUT4 endocytosis via ChDE may greatly increase insulin - stimulated glucose uptake . In muscle cells , K + - mediated depolarization reduces GLUT4 myc internalization . When co - stimulated with K + and insulin , an additive effect was noted on steady - state cell surface GLUT4 myc with insulin stimulation ( ~ 2 . 5x relative to basal ) . As mentioned , the effect of insulin occurs through increased exocytosis [ 345 ] . In contrast , the combination K + and insulin resulted in a synergistic increase in the rate of 2 - deoxygluycose uptake , of 6 - 7 - fold over basal ( N . Wijesekara and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) . These results suggest that decreasing GLUT4 internalization during insulin stimulation , as may occur during concomitant contraction , may allow the activated transporters to contribute to an increased rate of glucose uptake before they become internalized . Silencing of CHC by siRNA may be an interesting method to isolate the signals regulating GLUT4 intrinsic activation , since in CHC depleted cells , insulin failed to change cell surface levels of GLUT4 myc , likely as a consequence of blocked GLUT4 myc exocytosis ( Figure 69A ) . Yet in preliminary experiments , L6 myoblasts depleted of CHC by siRNA exhibited a ~ 50 % increase in glucose uptake following insulin stimulation ( Figure 69B & C ) . These results are consistent with insulin regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity separately from GLUT4 membrane traffic . 224 Figure 69 . SiRNA gene silencing of CHC completely abrogates insulin - stimulated GLUT4 myc translocation , yet appears not to inhibit stimulation of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake . L6 myoblasts were transfected with NR , CHC1 or CHC2 siRNA for 72h , as described in Chapter 5 . Following serum starvation , cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 20 min , or left unstimulated ( basal ) . Cell surface GLUT4 myc ( A ) and 2 - deoxyglucose uptake ( B ) were measured as described in Section 2 . 2 , and shown are the means ± SE of 2 or 4 independent experiments , respectively . C . Values from A and B were normalized to the basal condition of respective siRNA knockdown to compare the magnitude effect of CHC knockdown on insulin - stimulation of cell surface GLUT4 myc relative to that of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake . 6 . 2 Identification of the clathrin - independent mechanism of GLUT4 internalization As described in Chapter 5 , GLUT4 internalization occurs simultaneously via CME and ChDE . Whereas numerous components of CME are known , relatively little is known about the proteins involved in ChDE of GLUT4 , with the exception of the GTPase dynamin . Identifying components of ChDE is of particular interest as this route is regulated by energy shortage and perhaps also by muscle contraction . As ChDE of GLUT4 likely occurs simultaneously with IL - 2R β , the recently identified components of IL - 2R β internalization , Rac1 , Pak and cortactin 225 [ 486 ] , may also be required for ChDE of GLUT4 . A role for Rac1 in GLUT4 endocytosis is suggested based on observations that treatment of L6 myoblasts with NC23766 , a chemical inhibitor of Rac1 [ 727 ] . The drug lowered basal levels of GTP - bound Rac1 in L6 myoblasts by virtue of preventing Rac1 interaction with GEFs ( L . JeBailey and A . Klip , unpublished observations ) , and also increased cell - surface GLUT4 myc in the absence of insulin ( Figure 70 ) . Future experiments should use additional methods of perturbing Rac and Pak , such as siRNA gene silencing , to determine these proteins’ role in GLUT4 myc internalization via ChDE . Figure 70 . L6 myoblasts treated with an inhibitor of Rac1 , or expressing DN - Rac1 , exhibit an increase in cell surface GLUT4 . Following serum starvation , L6 myoblasts were treated with Rac1 inhibitor ( NSC23766 ) for 16h , followed by measurement of cell surface GLUT4 myc as described in Section 2 . 2 . Shown are the means ± SE of 3 - 7 independent experiments . This experiment was performed by Lellean JeBailey . Furthermore , preliminary experiments show a partial inhibition of GLUT4 myc internalization upon expression of a dominant - interfering cortactin SH3 domain ( data not shown ) . As cortactin is also required for CME , examination of the role of cortactin in the absence of CME is may required to determine its role in ChDE . Moreover , expression of the SH3 domain of cortactin may not be a specific method of perturbing cortactin function , as this strategy will likely prevent any functional interaction with the PRD of dynamin , not just that of full - length endogenous cortactin . SiRNA gene silencing of cortactin may represent a better strategy for these experiments . 226 It is possible that in addition to Rac , Pak and cortactin , other proteins participate in ChDE of GLUT4 . As dynamin is required for ChDE , one possibility for identifying such components of ChDE is to examine the binding partners of dynamin . However , dynamin likely participates in a variety of intracellular membrane budding events , and as such we must restrict our analysis to the plasma membrane , perhaps by first purifying plasma membrane fractions . Furthermore , dynamin also participates in CME and caveolar endocytosis , and as such , in order to identify ChDE - specific dynamin interactions , one must disrupt dynamin interactions involved in CME and caveolae . This may be achieved by first transfecting L6 cells with both siRNA to CHC and cDNAs encoding dominant - interfering caveolin - 1 , as described in Chapter 5 , followed by immunoprecipitation of dynamin . Proteins that co - immunoprecipitate with PM - associated dynamin in a manner that is not decreased following perturbation of clathrin and caveolar pits are good candidates for components of ChDE , and their requirement in GLUT4 internalization can be subsequently tested by siRNA gene silencing . Another approach to identify proteins required for ChDE of GLUT4 is to employ a functional measure of GLUT4 internalization in combination with an siRNA screen . To accomplish this , use of automated methods of scoring cell surface GLUT4 myc can identify particular genes , that when silenced , result in an increase in steady - state GLUT4 myc and thus candidates for ChDE of GLUT4 . High through - put methods for this analysis can be devised by adapting the cell population - based assay ( OPD , Section 2 . 2 ) for measuring GLUT4 to 96 - well plates , or fluorescence - based methods ( Section 3 . 2 ) can be used in conjunction with Cellomics automated confocal microscopy ( Cellomics , Inc , Pittsburgh , PA ) . As was the case for the identification of dynamin binding partners described above , performing this functional analysis in cells where CME is inhibited can restrict analysis to ChDE , such as by silencing CHC or examination of L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc . Several adaptor proteins for CME and their respective cargo recognition motifs are known , and little is known about this process for ChDE . If there is a peptide signal present on GLUT4 that is required for this process , it is likely that it would be found on G4 - loop , as this region is the largest exposed cytosolic region and exhibits the most homology between bt - GLUT4 and rat - GLUT4 . However , in a preliminary experiment , no effect of expression of GFP - 227 G4 - loop ( as was described in Chapter 3 ) was observed on GLUT4 internalization ( n = 1 , data not shown ) . It is possible that expression of GFP - G4loop occurred at levels insufficient to saturate binding to a ChDE adaptor . Consistent with this interpretation , internalization of GLUT4 occurred similarly when expressed > 6 fold the levels in L6 - GLUT4 myc cells ( Chapter 5 ) . However , it is also possible that , similar to disruption of AP - 2 discussed in Chapter 5 , expression of GFP - G4loop “frees” GLUT4 to internalize at a normal overall rate via CME . Thus , examination of the effect of GFP - G4loop expression on GLUT4 internalization should occur under conditions where CME is inhibited . Conversely , it is possible that G4 - loop does not contain the signal for the transporter’s ChDE . Identification of the signal targeting GLUT4 to ChDE , whether it is through interaction with protein adaptors or specific ChDE - localized lipids , or both , would be very useful in understanding this endocytic route . Furthermore , it is important to determine how PKC and AMPK signaling may affect these ChDE components . As DNP - regulated inhibition of GLUT4 internalization occurs due to a reduction in ChDE for multiple cargos , it is likely that the entire ChDE route is attenuated by DNP . Hence , it is possible that PKC and AMPK may target the Rac - Pak - cortactin pathway , dynamin , or some yet unidentified endocytic component , directly or indirectly , thereby attenuating ChDE . Future experiments probing possible phosphorylation or other post - translational modification sites on ChDE components may reveal the molecular basis for regulation . An interesting possibility for ChDE of GLUT4 is that it may be functionally coupled to GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis . The conventional model of exocytosis depicts vesicles collapsing into the plasma membrane upon fusion , and subsequent diffusion of cargo molecules laterally within the membrane ( Figure 71 ) . Subsequent endocytosis of cargo molecules requires collection of cargo from the bulk plasma membrane into membrane invaginations that will subsequently form nascent endocytic vesicles , such as is the case for CME . Alternatively , internalization can be coupled to exocytosis in a model where exocytic vesicles do not collapse into the plasma membrane upon fusion . Instead , vesicle cargos are retained within a vesicular structure with a lumen accessible to the extracellular medium and a lifetime of minutes , and that is finally resolved by internalization , termed “fuse - pinch - and - linger” ( reviewed by [ 728 ] ) . Internalization 228 coupled to fuse - pinch - and - linger exocytosis is clathrin - independent but requires dynamin , consistent with ChDE observed for GLUT4 . In order to determine if fuse - pinch - and - linger exocytosis occurs for GLUT4 vesicles in L6 myocytes , L6 cells can be transfected GLUT4 - GFP and also loaded with a fluid - phase marker such as rhodamine . Thus , L6 cells will contain GLUT4 vesicles marked by a membrane marker ( GLUT4 - GFP ) as well as a fluid - phase marker rhodamine ( Figure 71 ) . By using live - cell TIRF microscopy , one can observe single exocytic events as previously described [ 729 ] . By observing the dispersal of puncta of fluorescence corresponding to a vesicle into the larger space of the plasma membrane or extracellular medium , one can distinguish between these exocytosis - endocytosis coupling models . If dispersal of rhodamine occurs simultaneously with that of GLUT4 - GFP , then full collapse has occurred , and if the puncta of rhodamine is dispersed , while that of GLUT4 remains , “fuse - pinch - and - linger” has occurred . Figure 71 . Diagram of full - collapse and fuse - pinch and linger endocytosis . Shown is a depiction of the different fates of fluid - phase ( red ) and membrane - anchored ( green ) vesicular cargo upon membrane fusion . In full - collapse exocytosis , both fluid phase and membrane cargo diffuse into extracellular medium and plasma membrane , respectively . In fuse - pinch - and - linger exocytosis , fluid phase cargo disperses , yet the membrane - anchored cargos remain in membrane structures that are subsequently resolved via clathrin - independent yet dynamin - dependent endocytosis , without prior diffusion into the bulk membrane . 229 If the ChDE of GLUT4 endocytosis occurs as a consequence of fuse - pinch - and - linger exocytosis - endocytosis coupling , then this study will provide a novel understanding the molecular mechanism of GLUT4 internalization and possible regulation by DNP and contraction . Consistent with this possibility , recent work by Xu & col . has suggested that in adipocytes , about 15 % of GLUT4 exocytic events can be described as “fuse - pinch - and - linger” or “kiss - and - run” [ 321 ] , although this phenomenon remains to be examined in muscle cells in the context of GLUT4 endocytosis . Whichever mechanism of exocytosis is observed , live cell microscopy studies can then be extended to determine the sequence of recruitment of ChDE components such as dynamin , Rac , Pak , cortactin and other identified by the screens described above by use of florescent fusion versions of these proteins . Together , the experiments proposed may provide a more complete understanding of ChDE of GLUT4 , including possible coupling to exocytosis as well as identification of novel ChDE components , adaptors and cargo motifs , and their possible regulation by PKC and AMPK . Identification of these ChDE components will aid in study of GLUT4 internalization in primary skeletal muscle . 6 . 3 Determining the consequence of GLUT4 internalization via CME and ChDE As discussed in Chapter 5 , it is possible that each route of GLUT4 internalization delineates a distinct course of subsequent membrane traffic . In this model , there is little overlap of membrane vesicles derived from each endocytic mechanism until merger of membrane pools upon sorting into GSVs ( Chapter 4 & 5 ) . This model is supported by several observations . First , IL - 2R β remains associated with detergent resistant membranes following internalization , whereas TfR does not , suggesting that they are present , at least in part , on distinct membranes [ 484 ] . Moreover , IL - 2R β and TfR do not overlap following internalization , as assessed by fluorescence microscopy [ 486 ] . In addition , endocytic carriers derived from caveolae remain 230 segregated from the classical , CME - derived endosomal system , and target to structures termed caveosomes [ 730 , 731 ] . Alternatively , GLUT4 in vesicles derived from ChDE and CME may merge soon after internalization . In 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , GLUT4 internalizes largely via a CME - independent mechanism in the basal state [ 643 ] . Using a strategy of endosomal ablation of TfR that consists of oxidation of luminal compartments that internalize transferrin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase , GLUT4 was largely ablated within the first 30 minutes following its internalization in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 283 ] . These results suggest that most of the GLUT4 molecules share a luminal compartment with TfR and thus CME cargo proteins following these early times of internalization . However , the fusion of membranes derived from different internalization pathways may not result in complete mixing of membranes and their cargo [ 445 ] , thereby retaining cargo molecules segregated by route of entry within a common endosome . Thus , it is possible that proteins internalized by different routes share a lumen following internalization via distinct mechanisms yet remain separated within their pre - existing membrane regions . Thus , in order to understand the consequences of GLUT4 internalization within CME and ChDE , it is important to determine where and how vesicles derived from these routes may merge . One possibility for this is to examine the co - localization with and dependence on known components of the early endosome , such as TfR , Rab5 , Rab4 , and EEA1 . In rounded up L6 myoblasts , mammalian GLUT4 exhibits co - localization with EEA1 as early as 2 min following internalization , and this rapid arrival into early endosomes may be due to internalization via CME [ 26 ] . However , examination of GLUT4 arrival to EEA1 - positive early endosomes when restricted to ChDE , such as upon siRNA gene silencing of CHC or in L6 - bt - GLUT4 myc cells , may allow one to discern whether GLUT4 ChDE carriers transit through this early endosome in a manner similar to CME cargo . Furthermore , although Rab5 is likely involved in regulating membrane fusion of vesicles derived from multiple endocytic routes , including caveolae and CME [ 445 ] , it is possible that each route is differently affected by perturbation of Rab5 . In support of this observation , expression of a Rab5 GTP - binding deficient mutant ( S34N ) impairs insulin stimulated bt - GLUT4 myc but not rat - GLUT4 myc translocation to the cell surface ( Figure 72 ) . This result is consistent with previous reports that show that although Rab5 is required for 231 GLUT4 to arrive in the perinuclear region of 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , it is not required for GLUT4 to gain subsequent insulin - responsive GLUT4 exocytosis [ 294 ] . The result presented in Figure 72 likely suggests that Rab5 is required for eventual sorting to GSVs after internalization via ChDE yet is dispensable for similar sorting for cargo capable of CME . Figure 72 . Rab5 is likely required for bt - GLUT4 myc but not mammalian GLUT4 myc to gain insulin - responsive GLUT4 exocytosis . L6 myoblasts stably expressing either rat - or bt - GLUT4 myc were transfected with either GFP - Rab5 S34N ( GTP - binding deficient ) , GFP - Rab5 WT , or left untransfected ( UTF ) . Cells were stimulated with insulin ( 100nM ) for 20 minutes and cell surface GLUT4 myc was labeled with anti - myc ( polyclonal ) antibodies in intact cells . Cells were then fixed , permeabilized and internal GLUT4 myc was labeled with anti - myc ( monoclonal ) antibody . Appropriate secondary antibodies were used and cells were imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy . Cell surface GLUT4 myc was quantified by ratio of labeling intensities of surface GLUT4 myc to internal GLUT4 myc . Shown are the means ± SD of 2 independent experiments . Furthermore , ChDE - derived carriers could also conceivably merge with the CME - derived endosomes at the level of the recycling endosomes . Rab11 , which is involved in sorting of proteins in the recycling endosome [ 732 ] , is found on GLUT4 - containing vesicles [ 733 ] and 232 expression of a dominant - negative mutant of Rab11 ( N124I ) prevented insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation in H9C2 cardiomyocytes and primary human skeletal muscle cells [ 734 ] . Moreover , siRNA gene silencing of Rab11a , and its effector FIP2 , increased the abundance of GLUT4 at the cell surface of H9C2 - IR cells [ 735 ] . Therefore , it appears that Rab11 is required for recycling of GLUT4 , but whether this is the case for CME or ChDE derived carriers , or both , remains to be explored . As discussed in Chapter 4 , delineation of distinct membrane compartments traversed by GLUT4 can be done by SNAREs VAMP7 and VAMP2 , and possibly other tetanus - toxin insensitive SNARES such as VAMP4 . Colocalization experiments suggested that bt - GLUT4 myc , which internalizes via ChDE , does not traverse TfR and VAMP7 - positive endosomes . Future experiments examining the effect of siRNA to VAMP7 on bt - GLUT4 myc membrane traffic would greatly add to this analysis . Furthermore , determining the dependence of mammalian GLUT4 on VAMP7 in conjunction with siRNA to CHC represents another method of assessing ChDE carrier access to VAMP7 - dependent membrane compartments . Although bt - GLUT4 myc exhibits insulin - responsive GLUT4 exocytosis , and colocalizes with VAMP2 , it is not clear whether bt - GLUT4 does in fact sort into VAMP2 - positive GSVs , a question that can be addressed by siRNA gene silencing of VAMP2 . Another approach to determining the sorting of GLUT4 in ChDE versus CME routes is to examine the rates of membrane recycling following internalization via each route . Bt - GLUT4 myc recycles faster than rat - GLUT4 myc ( Figure 39 ) , suggesting that ChDE internalization leads to reduced intracellular retention . Similarly , restricting mammalian GLUT4myc to ChDE by CHC depletion enhanced GLUT4 recycling basal state ( data not shown ) . However , as siRNA to CHC abolished insulin - stimulated GLUT4 myc exocytosis ( Figure 69A ) , it is possible that the sorting stage of GLUT4 into GSVs from recycling endosomes is CHC - dependent . This in turn suggests that the increased recycling of rat GLUT4 myc to the PM upon CHC knockdown may not be due to internalization via ChDE per se , but an inability in intracellular budding for forming GSVs . In order to address this question , there is a need to inhibit clathrin - dependent membrane budding in a rapid and reversible manner , which will allow GLUT4 to internalize only via ChDE . Subsequently , a chase period in the absence of CHC 233 inhibition would allow CHC - dependent sorting into GSVs of GLUT4 internalized via ChDE . One attractive approach for such an inhibition is the expression of a fusion protein of FKBP with clathrin light chain ( FKBP - CLC ) that , upon addition of a chemical cross - linker of the FKBP domain , homo - dimerizes CLC , rendering both CLC and bound CHC non - functional for membrane budding [ 736 ] . We have thus created a similar cDNA construct of FKBP - CLC , which , when expressed in L6 cells treated with the chemical cross - linker AP20187 , exhibits in a preliminary experiment an inhibition of GLUT4 endocytosis ( Figure 73 ) . As this drug can be washed out , reversing FKBP dimerization , this strategy will , in principle , provide a method of assessing the sorting of ChDE - derived vesicles into GSVs without confounding effects of CHC - dependent intracellular sorting stages . 234 Figure 73 . Expression of FKBP - CLC in L6 myoblasts confers inhibition of GLUT4 myc endocytosis upon addition of FKBP chemical dimerizing drug AP20187 . A . Shown in ( i ) is a diagram depicting relative arrangement of a clathrin triskelion required for formation of the clathrin lattice within clathrin coated pits and vesicles . Individual clathrin heavy chain subunits are depicted in red , orange and black , and clathrin light chain ( CLC ) is depicted in teal . Shown in ( ii ) is a diagram depicting FKBP - CLC fusion protein , which also contains a C - terminal HA tag . The FKBP domain is based on the human FKBP12 ( FK506 binding protein ) , with mutations introduced to minimize binding of endogenous molecules ( Ariad Pharmaceuticals , Cambridge , MA ) . Addition of exogenous small - molecule ligand AP20187 causes FKBP - CLC to undergo reversible dimerization , rendering CLC , and bound triskelion molecules , unavailable for formation of clathrin lattices . B . L6 myoblasts were transfected with cDNA encoding FKBP - CLC - HA for 24h or left untransfected . Following serum starvation , cells were treated with AP20187 as indicted , and GLUT4 myc internalization was determined as described in Section 5 . 2 . ( n = 1 ) Some interesting future questions concern the possible role of specific lipids in ChDE of GLUT4 . As IL - 2R β internalization ( ChDE ) involves partitioning into detergent resistant membranes ( DRMs ) , and IL - 2R β remains within DRMs after internalization , it seems likely that GLUT4 may partition within similar membranes during ChDE . DRM are likely the reflection of a lipid - ordered domain that contains a specific subset of the lipids found in the plasma membrane . Identifying these lipids is important , although perhaps technically challenging . It may 235 be possible to isolate GLUT4 - containing vesicles under conditions where one of the two routes of internalization in perturbed , by using a GLUT4 - specific affinity column in the absence of detergent , and then using HPLC or GC - MS to identify lipid constituents of the purified vesicles . Comparing the lipid profiles of vesicles obtained in cells where GLUT4 is restricted to either ChDE - and CME - internalization may allow identification of specific lipids involved in each endocytic process . To ensure high purity of GLUT4 vesicles required for this analysis , use of magnetic bead purification , as has been used to obtain highly purified Golgi membranes , can be considered [ 737 ] . Another approach to identify lipid constituents of GLUT4 ChDE vesicles involves screening of an siRNA library of lipid enzymes for defects in GLUT4 myc internalization , in order to identify a lipid - metabolizing protein , and hence its lipid products and substrates , that could participate in formation of lipid - ordered domains in ChDE . Subsequent tagging of these lipids with fluorophores , as was done for BODIPY - LacCer , may then allow visualization of lipids within endocytic pits and vesicles . If specific ChDE lipid components can be identified , an important question to be addressed is the extent of the journey following internalization of ChDE - derived vesicles during which they retain these lipids . Furthermore , the role that these lipids themselves can play as signals in the intracellular sorting of GLUT4 could then be examined . The experiments described above for assessing the fate of GLUT4 vesicles derived from ChDE and CME rely on fluorescence microscopy and enzyme - coupled assays . However , significant insight can also be gained by electron microscopy analysis of whether GLUT4 internalized via ChDE can access membrane compartments associated with CME . Taken together , these approaches may shed insight into the complex membrane traffic of GLUT4 and allow understanding of what appears to be , for at least part of the journey , parallel traffic routes that link the plasma membrane and GSVs . 236 6 . 4 Contribution of altered GLUT4 endocytosis to disease and possible therapy It is possible that GLUT4 may undergo altered endocytosis under certain conditions , which could conceivably contribute to the development of certain pathologies . Specifically , obesity and insulin resistance are associated with the accumulation of several lipids in skeletal muscle , such as ceramide [ 738 ] and free fatty acids [ 739 , 740 ] . These could in turn affect partitioning of GLUT4 within lipid microdomains in the PM . As ChDE likely requires specific partitioning of GLUT4 within lipid - ordered domains , altered lipid contents could either potentiate or inhibit ChDE of GLUT4 . If ChDE is potentiated , a decrease in cell surface GLUT4 may occur in skeletal muscle , which could result in decreased blood glucose clearance . Furthermore , in Chapters 4 & 5 , it was proposed that ChDE of GLUT4 may lead to recycling of the transporter via GR2 , which leads to a lower degree of sorting into GSVs than CME , which may recycle via GR1 . As such , perturbation of GLUT4 endocytosis could lead to subsequent inhibition or enhancement of insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation , possibly having profound effects on whole - body glucose metabolism . Ceramide has been shown to alter insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation in L6 myoblasts [ 62 ] and 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 741 , 742 ] . Importantly , increased ceramide levels can alter internalization of CD81 [ 743 ] , and heparin sulfate proteoglycan and low - density lipoprotein - related protein uptake [ 744 ] . Consistent with a role in altering membrane portioning , increasing ceramide concentration has also been proposed to cause phase transitions within the plasma membrane [ 745 ] . Interestingly , TNF α treatment , which results in insulin resistance in adipocytes and skeletal muscle , lead to an increase in the acidic glycosphingolipid ganglioside GM3 in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , in turn resulting in loss of IR and IRS - 1 from DRMs [ 746 ] . TNF α , by acting to modulate the levels of particular lipids , may perturb lipid microdomains in the plasma membrane . Therefore , the altered lipid content of skeletal muscle observed during obesity , insulin resistance and diabetes could result in altered partitioning of GLUT4 within DRMs , thereby 237 altering GLUT4 internalization . Thus , L6 - GLUT4 myc myocytes offer an advantageous model to systematically study the effect of addition of various lipids that are increased during obesity and insulin resistance , such as ceramide , on GLUT4 myc internalization and membrane traffic . Thus , modulation of GLUT4 endocytosis by administration of drugs could help to perform several tasks . Firstly , inhibition of GLUT4 endocytosis could directly cause an increase in cell surface GLUT4 , mimicking insulin and contraction with respect to enhanced rates of glucose uptake . In addition , as discussed above , shifting GLUT4 endocytosis from ChDE to CME may result in an increase in subsequent insulin - stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis as a result of more efficient sorting to GSVs . In order to identify compounds that could have these effects , a screen of a chemical library for an increase in L6 cell surface GLUT4 myc can be performed . Subsequent refinement of compounds identified may reveal a drug that can reduce GLUT4 myc internalization , thereby increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle . Such a drug would be very useful for treatment of both type I and type II diabetes mellitus . An important consideration is that obesity and insulin resistance are complex disorders that are associated with numerous physiological changes . As such , examination of GLUT4 myc internalization in vivo or in ex vivo primary skeletal muscle would provide valuable insight into these pathologies . 6 . 5 General Conclusions The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that the plasma membrane is an important site of regulation of GLUT4 function . Modulation of intrinsic activity and internalization of the transporter add layers of complexity on top of the documented regulation of GLUT4 exocytosis . These multiple facets of GLUT4 function reflect the importance of precise modulation of glucose transport for whole - body glucose homeostasis . 238 References 1 Von Mering , J . and Minkowski , O .

J Biol Chem 270 , 3938 - 3943 309 Appendices 7 Dissociation of stimulation of glucose uptake from that of cell surface GLUT4 content Rerproduced with permission from Current Medicinal Chemistry – Immunology , Endocrine & Metabolic Agents ( 2005 ) 5 : 175 - 187 There have been numerous studies that have examined the amount of GLUT4 recruited to the cell surface by insulin and other stimuli and , in parallel , the corresponding increase in the rate of glucose uptake ( Table 7 , Table 8 , Table 9 ) . Many such studies find a discrepancy between these measurements . Although such findings may suggest that certain cellular conditions regulate by glucose uptake by GLUT4 independently from the amount of cell surface GLUT4 , other parameters could contribute to this discrepancy depending on the methods used to measure the rate of glucose uptake and cell surface GLUT4 . This section examines the methods used to measure glucose uptake , and cell surface GLUT4 levels , and offers some explanations for the discrepancy in the magnitude of insulin - stimualtion between these parameters . Methods for measuring GLUT4 translocation Detection of glucose transporters in subcellular membrane fractions . Subcellular fractionation is commonly used to separate GLUT4 in the plasma membrane ( PM ) from intracellular compartments of cells in culture and isolated tissues by centrifugation in sucrose gradients ( reviewed in [ 747 ] ) . Following stimulation of cells with insulin , a loss of GLUTs in the intracellular compartment is observed , which is paralleled in time by a gain in the PM fraction [ 748 ] . Glucose transporters in these isolated membrane fractions are then detected by immunoblotting fractions with isoform - specific anti - GLUT antibodies [ 570 , 749 ] or binding of the radioactive ligand [ 3 H ] - cytochalasin B to GLUTs [ 748 , 750 ] . Although widely used to assess GLUT translocation , this latter procedure cannot differentiate between GLUT4 and GLUT1 , or 310 potentially other isoforms . Moreover , this method does not allow quantitative measurement of GLUT4 inserted in the plasma membrane that is capable of glucose transport , as PM membrane fractions likely also contain vesicles and other membranes . Photoaffinity labeling of cell surface GLUT4 transporters with ATB - BMPA . Photoaffinity labeling of cell surface GLUT4 transporters has been employed as an improved method to detect GLUT4 translocation ( reviewed in [ 747 ] ) . The most commonly used photolabel is the bis - mannose - derived N - [ 4 - ( 1 - azi - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethyl ) benzoyl ] - 1 , 3 - bis ( D - mannos - 4 - yloxy ) - 2 - propylamine ( ATB - BMPA ) [ 751 ] . The membrane - impermeant reagent contains a sugar - like moiety recognized by transporters and a reactive group that undergoes covalent insertion into neighbouring atoms on the transporter upon photoactivation [ 751 ] , and specific GLUT isoforms can then be detected by immunoblotting following isolation of labeled proteins . However , since photolabels react with the active hexose - binding site of transporters , the binding of the photoaffinity labels to GLUT4 may also depend on the intrinsic activity or conformational state of the transporters ( Figure 8 ) [ 172 , 571 ] . Localization of GLUT4 by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy . The localization of GLUT4 within a cell can be determined by immunofluorescence or immunoelectron microscopy following labeling with GLUT4 - specific antibodies , followed by detection of antibodies by fluorophore - or gold - conjugation , respectively . In addition , GLUT4 transporters fused to fluorescent protein tags such as green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) can be expressed in cells and visualized by fluorescence microscopy . These methods provide information about the relative localization of GLUT4 within cells near the PM [ 640 , 752 - 756 ] . However , these methods do not allow quantitative measurement of GLUT4 inserted in the plasma membrane that is capable of glucose transport . Detection GLUT4 via an extracellular epitope . A useful method to measure the amount of cell surface GLUT4 irrespective of the glucose binding site is to quantify the amount of exofacial tag epitopes on the protein ( reviewed in [ 747 ] ) such as by using GLUT4 that harbors myc - or HA - epitopes in its first exofacial loop . Detection of translocation is achieved by labeling intact cells with epitope - specific antibody and the amount of bound antibody is then detected by colorimetric means or by immunofluorescence [ 757 ] . This method provides the advantage of 311 detecting cell surface transporters in intact cells under conditions similar to those used to measure the rate of hexose uptake . Because the myc - or HA - epitopes are not involved in glucose uptake , it is expected that their accessibility to antibody would be independent of the state of activity of the transporter . Limited trypsin digestion of GLUT4 in intact cells . The amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface can also be determined by the accessibility of the transporter to limited proteolytic digestion by cell - membrane impermeant trypsin [ 719 , 758 ] . Following treatment of intact cells with the enzyme , SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting with GLUT4 - specific antibodies , an approximately 35kDa fragment of GLUT4 is revealed , along with the undigested GLUT4 ( ~ 50kDa ) from compartments inaccessible to trypsin [ 719 ] . The amount of digested GLUT4 provides a quantitative measure of the GLUT4 available at the plasma membrane and capable of hexose transport . Biotinylation of cell - surface GLUT4 . A method analogous to detection of GLUT4 via an extracellular epitope and limited trypsin digest of GLUT4 is the biotinylation of GLUT4 in intact cells . Treatment of cells with sodium metaperiodate followed by addition of biocytin hydrazide allows biotinylation of carbohydrate moeities of surface proteins [ 759 ] . Following cell lysis , surface GLUT4 is detected by immunoprecipitation of GLUT4 , SDS - PAGE , and labeling with [ 125 I ] - streptavidin . Methods to measure the rate of glucose uptake 3 - O - methylglucose uptake . The determination of the rate of glucose transport typically involves measurement of the rate of transport of non - metabolizable radiolabeled glucose analogues . Since 3 - O - methylglucose cannot be phosphorylated by hexokinase , transport reaches equilibrium between extracellular and intracellular milieus within minutes , it is essential to measure its initial rates of transport . However , for cells with a high glucose transport capacity , 3 - O - methylglucose uptake equilibrium is reached rapidly , making it difficult to measure its initial rate of uptake ( Figure 7 ) . This may prove especially problematic when measuring 3 - O - 312 methylglucose uptake in isolated tissues , as is the case in muscle , were the concentration of intracellular 3 - O - methylglucose in the superficial fibers can reach saturation at a time when the interstitial space around deeper fibers has not yet equilibrated with the medium [ 760 ] . 2 - deoxyglucose uptake . The non - metabolizable glucose analogue 2 - deoxyglucose has been used to circumvent the problems of transport saturation displayed by 3 - O - methylglucose . Following entry into the cell , 2 - deoxyglucose is rapidly phosphorylated by hexokinase to yield 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate but it is not further metabolised within the time frame commonly used to measure transport activity [ 761 ] . Since 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate cannot be transported out of the cell [ 761 ] , the uptake of 2 - deoxyglucose is virtually unidirectional and equilibration is avoided . In fact , because 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate does not exit the cells , it possible to measure its accumulation over a longer period of time , and glucose transporter inhibitors are not typically used to terminate the 2 - deoxyglucose transport reaction ( Figure 7 ) . However , the measurement of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake in this manner is based on the assumption that transport , and not phosphorylation , is rate - limiting for the accumulation of 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate in cells . Glucose uptake . In addition to using glucose analogues to measure glucose transport activity , radiolabeled glucose is sometimes used [ 762 ] . In this case , it is even more important to ascertain the rate - limiting step of radiolabel accumulation . Thus , glucose is not as widely used as 2 - deoxyglucose or 3 - O - methylglucose to study the rate of hexose transport . However , use of radiolabeled glucose has been used to determine the rate of hexose uptake in isolated systems , such as into plasma membrane vesicles , which are devoid of metabolic enzymes [ 763 , 764 ] . Comparison of rates of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation Given the properties of each methodology used , there are several possible explanations for the discrepancy between cell surface GLUT4 and the rate of glucose uptake , including the contribution of other hexose transporters , underestimation of GLUT4 translocation and 313 interference of glucose uptake by inhibitors . When considering these possibilities , considerable evidence suggests that insulin regulates the intrinsic catalyic activity of GLUT4 . Contribution of other hexose transporters to glucose uptake . Although GLUT4 is important for the uptake of glucose , it is not the only transporter expressed in insulin - responsive tissues and these other isoforms can contribute to stimulated glucose uptake . Conversely , if a transporter other than GLUT4 were responsible for glucose uptake preferentially under basal conditions , the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin would be smaller than the magnitude of GLUT4 translocation . In addition to GLUT4 , adipocytes contain GLUT1 [ 7 , 209 , 570 , 749 ] and GLUT12 [ 8 ] . In skeletal muscle , GLUT4 is the predominant glucose transporter isoform , but this tissue also contains GLUT1 [ 7 ] , GLUT3 [ 206 , 209 ] , GLUT11 [ 765 ] , and GLUT12 [ 8 ] . As stated earlier , CB - binding detects the total cell surface amount of multiple GLUT isoforms . Thus , although many studies reported that insulin - stimulated CB - binding to PM membranes is inferior to the stimulation of glucose uptake in the corresponding intact rat adipocytes [ 356 , 766 , 767 ] , human femoral adipocytes [ 768 ] and isolated rat skeletal muscle [ 763 , 764 ] , these studies are difficult to use for this comparison . A useful means to determine the amount of glucose transport occurring through GLUT4 makes use of the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir , which inhibits glucose transport through GLUT4 but not through its most closely related glucose transporters GLUT1 , GLUT2 , GLUT3 or GLUT8 [ 277 , 769 ] . Using indinavir in the glucose transport assay , it was concluded that 80 - 90 % of glucose transport occurs through GLUT4 in isolated white adipocytes [ 769 ] . In isolated brown adipocytes , 3T3 - L1 adipocytes and isolated mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longum muscles , the majority of glucose transport was inhibited by indinavir under both basal and insulin - stimulated conditions [ 769 ] . These findings suggest that although several transporters could contribute to glucose transport in muscle and fat , GLUT4 is the major glucose transporter responsible for glucose influx , at least in response to insulin . An additional way to overcome the possible contributions of other GLUT isoforms to glucose uptake is to examine glucose uptake upon over - expression of GLUT4 . GLUT4 has been overexpressed in L6 muscle cells [ 757 ] , where 70 - 80 % of glucose transport occurs through GLUT4 , based on indinavir sensitivity [ 769 ] and in transgenic mice [ 770 ] . In such GLUT4 - 314 overexpressing cells , the magnitudes of insulin - stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation do not match under several conditions [ 168 , 771 - 774 ] . Thus , although it is possible to ascribe some of the glucose uptake to transporters other than GLUT4 , this alone cannot fully account for the discrepancy between the extent of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin . Plasma membrane fraction contamination . Following the arrival of GLUT4 vesicles at the plasma membrane , their subsequent insertion is necessary to render the transporters available to transport glucose . Unfortunately , neither subcellular fractionation nor fluorescence microscopy techniques that detect GLUT4 via intracellular epitopes distinguish between GLUT4 vesicles that are docked and those that that are fused with the plasma membrane and able to transport glucose . It has been proposed that some stimuli , including insulin , may regulate both the arrival and the fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the PM ( reviewed in [ 775 ] ) , and the presence of unfused vesicles can alter measurement of GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface . Hence , measurements of cell surface GLUT4 by subcellular fractionation are not ideal for comparison with rates of glucose uptake . Regulation of glucose uptake by post - transport events . Glucose transport , and not phosphorylation , is thought to be rate - limiting for glucose influx into muscle and fat cells . This is based on the lack of detection of intracellular glucose in human muscle , as measured by [ 13 C ] - NMR [ 776 ] , and in cells in culture , accompanied by the virtual absence of glucose efflux [ 777 , 778 ] . Moreover , measurements of 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate show it not exceeding 30 mM in typical 2 - deoxyglucose measurements , the lowest concentration of 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate causing inhibition of hexokinase [ 760 ] . However , the view that hexose transport is rate - limiting for hexose uptake under all conditions has been challenged by recent reports . Wasserman and colleagues [ 779 , 780 ] demonstrated that over - expression of hexokinase II in mouse skeletal muscle can lead to increased disposal of 2 - deoxyglucose following insulin stimulation or exercise but not in resting animals . These results raise the possibility that glucose transport ceases to be rate - limiting in the stimulated muscle , so that intracellular free glucose might accumulate and curb the net influx . 315 Also , in cultured human muscle cells , free 2 - deoxyglucose accumulated inside cells during the 2 - deoxyglucose uptake measurements [ 781 ] . Since the rate of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake into cells provides a measurement of the combined rate of hexose transport and hexose phosphorylation , and under some circumstances the rate - limiting step is not verified , caution must be used when interpreting the results obtained . In situations where stimulation of 2 - deoxyglucose uptake does not match the stimulation of GLUT4 translocation , a shift in the rate - limiting step from glucose uptake to phosphorylation could account for this discrepancy . This can be verified by measuring the intracellular concentrations of free 2 - deoxyglucose and 2 - deoxyglucose - 6 - phosphate [ 781 ] . Thus , there is some ambiguity in interpreting the results obtained using 2 - deoxyglucose or glucose to measure the rate of hexose uptake into cells . Even so , alteration in the rate - limiting step of glucose uptake alone cannot account for the all differences observed between hexose uptake and GLUT4 at the cell surface since this discrepancy is also encountered when measuring 3 - O - methylglucose uptake [ 356 , 571 , 749 , 753 , 766 - 768 , 782 - 786 ] or when measuring hexose uptake into PM vesicles devoid of hexokinase [ 764 , 766 , 767 , 787 ] . Therefore , it is possible that some of the differences between GLUT4 translocation to the PM and the stimulation of the rate of glucose uptake in response to insulin might be due to activation of GLUT4 . Possible interaction of drugs that differentially affect GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake with glucose transporters . Several agents have been used to segregate insulin - stimulated glucose uptake from GLUT4 translocation . The p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 [ 168 ] , the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and U0169 [ 788 ] , the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein [ 789 ] , and oleate [ 790 ] all reduce insulin - stimulated glucose uptake without diminishing the number of GLUT4 molecules inserted in the plasma membrane . As discussed for SB203580 ( see Section 2 . 7 ) , it is possible that the discrepancy between glucose uptake and cell surface GLUT4 results from direct inhibition of GLUT4 . In fact , genistein has been proposed to bind directly to GLUT1 [ 614 ] , and thus cold also inhibit GLUT4 . More specific evidence for direct binding to and inhibition of GLUT4 is the HIV protease indinavir GLUT4 [ 277 , 769 ] . In addition , metalloendoproteinase substrates inhibit hexose uptake into vesicles derived from purified membrane fractions [ 588 ] , suggesting that this inhibition is through direct interaction with glucose transporters . 316 Thus , care must be taken when examining results showing decreased glucose uptake following treatment with inhibitors without a change in cell surface GLUT4 . However , there are conditions that reduce insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation without diminishing stimulated glucose uptake such as treatment with cyclic AMP analogues [ 749 ] , and pre - treatment of the cells with high insulin - high glucose concentrations [ 791 ] . In these instances , it is possible that compensatory mechanisms boost up the activity of GLUT4 . Regulation of GLUT4 intrinsic activity . Exofacial epitope detection and trypsin accessibility in intact cells can be used to unambiguously detect the amount of cell surface GLUT4 that is inserted in the plasma membrane . In brown adipocytes isolated from mice overexpressing GLUT4 myc , insulin caused a 2 - fold gain in surface GLUT4 and a 6 . 1 - fold rise in glucose uptake [ 770 ] . Since insulin - stimulated glucose uptake was nearly completely inhibited by indinavir [ 521 ] , GLUT4 is deemed to be the predominant functional transporter . Several other studies also found that the stimulation of GLUT4 translocation , measured by epitope detection in intact 3T3 - L1 adipocytes , is inferior to that that of glucose uptake following insulin treatment [ 560 , 788 , 792 ] . Thus , in these systems , insulin increases the glucose flux per GLUT4 transporter , suggesting that the hormone increases the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 . In addition to insulin , other stimuli also elicit a discrepancy between the stimulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation . Treating L6 myotubes with a permeable version of the insulin signaling intermediate phosphatidylinositol - ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) caused translocation of GLUT4 ( measured by epitope detection in intact cells ) without any increase in 2 - deoxyglucose or 3 - O - methylglucose uptake [ 623 ] . This finding suggests that following insulin stimulation , distinct mechanisms may regulate GLUT4 translocation and GLUT4 activation . Taken together , the discrepancies observed between insulin - stimulated increases in glucose uptake and cell surface GLUT4 have several possible explanation , yet some of these observations are best explained by an insulin - stimulated regulation in the intrinsic glucose transport activity of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane . 317 Table 7 .
