Eight synthetic - diacyl PCs were chosen with 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation that ranged from one double bond ( C18 : 0 / 1 , C18 : 1 / 0 ) to six double bonds per PC molecule ( diC18 : 3 ) . Produced by increasing pipette pressurization , membrane tensions for lysis of single vesicles at 21°C ranged from ; 9 to 10 mN / m for mono - and dimono - unsaturated PCs ( 18 : 0 / 1 , 18 : 1 / 0 , and diC18 : 1 ) but dropped abruptly to ; 5 mN / m when one or both PC chains contained two cis - double bonds ( C18 : 0 / 2 and diC18 : 2 ) and even lower ; 3 mN / m for diC18 : 3 . Driven by osmotic filtration following transfer of individual vesicles to a hypertonic environment , the apparent coefficient for water permeability at 21°C varied modestly in a range from ; 30 to 40 m m / s for mono - and dimono - unsaturated PCs . However , with two or more cis - double bonds in a chain , the apparent permeability rose to ; 50 m m / s for C18 : 0 / 2 , then strikingly to ; 90 m m / s for diC18 : 2 and ; 150 m m / s for diC18 : 3 . The measurements of water permeability were found to scale exponentially with the reduced temperatures reported for these lipids in the literature . The correlation supports the concept that increase in free volume acquired in thermal expansion above the main gel - liquid crystal transition of a bilayer is a major factor in water transport . Taken together , the prominent changes in lysis tension and water permeability indicate that major changes occur in chain packing and cohesive interactions when two or more cis - double bonds alternate with saturated bonds along a chain . INTRODUCTION The majority of phospholipid acyl chains in animal cell membranes are saturated ( only C O C bonds ) or monounsat - urated ( one C A C bond ) hydrocarbon polymers . Conse - quently , phospholipid bilayers with saturated or monoun - saturated chains have been studied extensively , which includes the gel - to - liquid crystalline phase transitions that are prominent for saturated PC bilayers above 0°C in aque - ous environments . Interestingly , to ensure that membranes of eukaryotic cells remain fluid ( yet maintain strong , nearly impermeable interfaces ) , nature seems to have preferred cholesterol as a co - constituent even though polyunsatura - tion can also keep bilayers fluid to below water freezing temperatures . A simple rationale for not choosing polyun - saturated lipids is that they oxidize easily and would be chemically expensive to keep in membranes . But surpris - ingly , there are membranes rich in polyunsaturated lipids , as in brain tissue . Lipid polyunsaturation is not the only dis - tinguishing feature of these special membranes ; there are usually significant variations in chain lengths and differ - ences in cholesterol content . Even so , we are compelled to ask how such labile and exotic lipids affect the material characteristics of membranes ? Here , we report measure - ments of dynamic material properties—mechanical rupture strength and water permeability—of fluid diacyl phosphati - dylcholine PC bilayers with equal chain lengths of 18 car - bons and a wide range of unsaturation ( 1 , 2 , 4 , or 6 double bonds per lipid ) . In a companion article ( Rawicz et al . , 2000 ) , we present measurements of equilibrium elastic— and thickness—properties of the same PC bilayers . In both studies , we have used micropipette aspiration methods to directly measure membrane mechanical properties and per - meability to water on giant - single bilayer vesicles . In this study , the results show that polyunsaturated PC bilayers are much more permeable and much weaker than the prototyp - ical monounsaturated lipid bilayer . Several techniques have been used to quantitate mechan - ical stretch properties of bilayers , which include the mi - cropipette approach we have pioneered for giant vesicles ( Kwok and Evans , 1981 ; Evans and Needham , 1987 ) , pho - ton correlation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering of small vesicles under osmotic stress ( Rutkowski et al . , 1991 ; Hallett et al . , 1993 ) , cryoelectron microscopy of vesicles subjected to osmotic stress ( Mui et al . , 1993 ) , nuclear mag - netic resonance NMR and x - ray diffraction of strongly dehydrated multibilayer arrays ( Koenig et al . , 1997 ) , plus others . Of these approaches , only the micropipette method can provide measurements of bilayer stretch on a single vesicle with a resolution of better than 0 . 1 % relative change in area , test elasticity and reversibility , plus determine in - stantaneous tension and area dilation at rupture . In compar - ison to mechanical properties , permeability of bilayers to water has a long history embodied in numerous references describing a variety of measurements from osmotic filtra - tion to isotope diffusion ( Finkelstein , 1987 , covers many of Received for publication 1 October 1999 and in final form 28 March 2000 .

A prominent feature of water permeability measurements has been the significant variation in values obtained by different techniques and different laboratories . For instance , in early work on permeability of egg PC bilayers ( similar to C18 : 0 / 1 PC tested here ) , the values of water permeability ranged from 10 to 50 m m / s ( Fettiplace and Haydon , 1980 ) . Like - wise , permeability coefficients for osmotic filtration in some studies exceeded the values of permeability derived from tracer diffusion ( Jansen and Blume , 1989 ) whereas in others , no difference was found between results with the two methods ( Finkelstein , 1987 ; Ye and Verkman , 1989 ) . More than experimental aesthetics , careful comparison of these two types of permeability measurement is expected to reveal important insights as to the mechanism of transport ( Finkelstein , 1987 ; Paula et al . , 1996 ; Xiang and Anderson , 1997 ) . In our tests , the goal has been to expose the impact of polyunsaturation on permeability of single bilayers to water . Our approach has been to use micropipette aspiration of giant unilamellar vesicles and manipulation into a hyper - osmotic environment as a simple technique to measure water filtration . The unique feature of the method is that it provides direct observation of water filtration across a sin - gle solvent - free and unsupported bilayer , which can be easily analyzed to obtain the coefficient for bilayer perme - ability to water . MATERIALS AND METHODS Lipids Eight synthetic species of diacyl C18 PC lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) in chloroform and used without further purification . Seven were cis unsaturated : 1 - stearoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( C18 : 0 / 1 c9 ) ; 1 - oleoyl - 2 - stearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - choline ( C18 : 1 c9 / 0 ) ; 1 , 2 - dipetroselinoleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( diC18 : 1 c6 ) ; 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( diC18 : 1 c9 ) ; 1 - stearoyl - 2 - linoleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( C18 : 0 / 2 c9 , 12 ) ; 1 , 2 - di - linoleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( diC18 : 2 c9 , 12 ) ; and 1 , 2 - dilino - lenoyl - sn - 3 - phosphatidylcholine ( diC18 : 3 c9 , 12 , 15 ) . One was trans unsatur - ated : 1 , 2 - elaidoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( diC18 : 1 t9 ) . The solutions were placed in amber glass screw - cap vials with Teflon - lined silicone septa . Especially important for the preservation of the oxidation - prone fatty acid chains ( C18 : 0 / 2 , diC18 : 2 , and diC18 : 3 ) , the vials were wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at 2 20°C under argon . Vesicle preparation and assay of lipid oxidation In our laboratories , the generic procedure for preparation of giant vesicles ( 15 – 30 m m diameter ) is to rehydrate lipid films dried first from chloro - form / methanol ( 2 : 1 ) onto the surface of a roughened Teflon disk ( Needham et al . , 1988 ) . After deposition of the lipid film and evaporation of the organic solvent in vacuo , the Teflon disk is covered with a warm ( 37°C ) sucrose solution ( 200 mOsm ) and allowed to hydrate . To create a refractive index contrast between inside / outside of vesicles and to sediment vesicles in the microscope chamber , an aliquot of vesicles is diluted manyfold in an equiosmolar solution of glucose or electrolyte buffer . The refractive index gradient is used to enhance optical detection of the projection length inside the pipette as shown by the example in Fig . 1 . Described below , accurate video tracking of the projection edge enables discrimination of , 0 . 1 % relative change in vesicle area or volume , even though optical measure - ments of total area and volume remain limited to a few percent accuracy by diffraction . For formation of vesicles from polyunsaturated lipids , slight modifications were made in the procedure . First , argon - purged , deionized water was used to make the hydration and suspension solutions . Second , the container with the polyunsaturated lipid film was wrapped in aluminum foil ( to minimize exposure to light ) . The polyunsaturated lipids were allowed to hydrate for only three hours under argon and used immediately ( normally , lipids are left to hydrate overnight then used the next day ) . At the beginning of the study , samples of the polyunsaturated lipids were tested for possible oxidative damage over the time scales associated with preparation and experiment by spectrophotometric assay ( Kim and La - Bella , 1987 ; New , 1990 ) . The absorbance of a solution of 1 mM lipid in absolute ethanol was measured at ; 230 nm using a Beckman DU - 7500 diode - array spectrophotometer ( Beckman , Fullerton , CA ) . Absorption at this wavelength indicated the presence of conjugated dienes in the hydro - carbon chain , which result from oxidation ( Kim and LaBella , 1987 ; New , 1990 ) . Lipid samples used soon after arrival from Avanti showed no detectable oxidative damage . Moreover , measurements of properties re - peated with preparations from the same polyunsaturated lipid samples and from new samples purchased at later times gave identical results . Mechanical expansion and rupture of vesicle bilayers Micropipette suction was used to pressurize vesicles and stretch bilayers to rupture . Well - established from mechanics ( Kwok and Evans , 1981 ) , suc - tion pressure P applied to a fluid - bilayer vesicle produces a uniform membrane tension t m , which is described by a simple geometric relation based on the pipette caliber ( diameter ) D p and diameter D v of the vesicle - spherical segment exterior to the pipette , i . e . , t m 5 PD p / 4 ~ 1 2 D p / D v ! The pipette suction ( ; 10 3 Pa ) needed to expand the area of a ; 20 m m vesicle is small compared to osmotic driving forces ( ; 10 5 Pa ) required to kinetically displace water on the time scale of the experiment and small compared to the osmotic activity of the trapped sucrose ( ; 5 3 10 5 Pa ) . Thus , vesicle volume remains effectively fixed in the area expansion test . Increase of the aspirated projection length L p inside the pipette provides a direct measure of the area expansion . Precise changes in area D A with displacement D L p of the projection length in experiments were computed numerically as described in the Appendix . The proportionality between area and length is easily seen in the following first - order approximation : D A < p D p ~ 1 2 D p / D v ! D L p FIGURE 1 Video micrograph of a single bilayer vesicle ( diameter ; 20 m m ) held by micropipette suction . 322 Olbrich et al . Biophysical Journal 79 ( 1 ) 321 – 327 Backed by this analysis , the following simple procedure was used to test membrane strength and maximum dilation . The vesicle was first pre - stressed under a tension of ; 0 . 5 mN / m to incorporate hidden - excess area . Then , pipette suction was increased in steps—each held steady for several seconds—until lysis occurred ( total pressurization time of , 1 min ) at pressures of ; 1 – 5 3 10 3 Pa , where tensions reached the range of 3 – 10 mN / m for lysis , depending on the lipid . Osmotic filtration of water from single vesicles To measure bilayer permeability to water , single vesicles were selected by a micropipette and transferred to an adjacent microscope chamber with ; 10 % higher solute concentration . In the new environment , water was driven out of the vesicle by strong osmotic forces ( . 10 5 Pa ) to achieve equilibrium . The time course of vesicle dehydration was tracked and analyzed to obtain the transport coefficient for water filtration . To transfer a vesicle through the small air gap that separated the microscope chambers , the vesicle was maneuvered into the entrance of another larger pipette . The microscope stage was then translated to leave the sheltered vesicle in the second chamber , where it was brought out into the new environment . Typically , vesicles were transferred from a chamber that contained a 200 mOsm glucose solution to a chamber that contained a hypertonic ( 220 mOsm ) glucose solution . However , specific tests were also performed at twofold higher osmolarities to verify the expected proportionality between filtration rate and level of osmolarity . Transfer back to the original chamber was used to verify that the water exchange was recoverable and that no sucrose solute escaped or glucose solute entered the vesicle . Throughout the test , the vesicle was held under small fixed suction pressure to control bilayer tension ( ; 1 mN / m ) . Thus , changes in vesicle volume occurred at constant area and were computed precisely from displacements of the projection length inside the pipette , as described in the Appendix . The proportionality between change in volume D V and displacement D L p of the projection length is demonstrated by the first - order approximation : D V < 2 p D p ~ D v 2 D p ! D L p / 4 Displacement of the projection length of an aspirated vesicle under osmotic dehydration is shown in Fig . 2 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS Water permeability Measurements of aspiration length versus time after transfer of vesicles to a hypertonic environment were used to quan - titate water filtration over the course to a new state of osmotic equilibrium . Fig . 3 shows the time dependence of vesicle dehydration followed by rehydration ( when returned to the original chamber ) , which illustrates both approach to osmotic equilibrium and reversibility . The kinetics of the time course were analyzed with the standard phenomeno - logical law for water transport across a semipermeable membrane and the dilute concentration approximation for osmotic activity ( Finkelstein , 1987 ) . As such , the rate of change in vesicle volume per unit of surface area A is governed by the bilayer permeability coefficient P f and the outside - inside difference D c in osmolarity , according to 1 / A ~ d V / d t ! 5 2 ~ P f n w ! D c where n w is the molar volume of water ( 18 ml / mol ) . Be - cause the membrane is impermeable to solutes ( on the time scale for water filtration ) , the instantaneous osmolarity of the vesicle interior is set by the number of moles m of solute and the volume , i . e . , c 5 m / V . Scaling instantaneous volume by the final equilibrium volume V ‘ , we obtain a dimension - less kinetic equation for the time course to the new equi - librium state , d V * / d t 5 2 P f c ‘ n w ~ A / V ‘ ! @ ~ V * 2 1 ! / V * # with definitions of V * 5 V / V ‘ and c ‘ equal to the final osmolarity . Relative to the dimensionless volume V o * at time t 5 0 , the time course obeys the following transcendental FIGURE 2 Video micrographs of a single bilayer vesicle during the course of dehydration in a water filtration experiment . The increase in aspiration length inside the pipette is proportional to the reduction in vesicle volume . Water Permeability and Mechanical Strength of Polyunsaturated Lipid Bilayers 323 Biophysical Journal 79 ( 1 ) 321 – 327 equation : ~ V * 2 1 ! exp ~ V * ! 5 ~ V * o 2 1 ! exp ~ 2 k z t 1 V * o ! with the time rate of decay set by k 5 A ( P f c ‘ n w ) / V ‘ . Using a nonlinear fitting algorithm , this equation was matched to the time - dependent change in volume of each vesicle tested , which yielded the time constant 1 / k for ap - proach to osmotic equilibrium . From each value of the decay constant we obtained an apparent measure of the permeability coefficient ( P fapp ) . As seen above , the time constant for volume changes scales inversely with the os - molarity of the environment . This intrinsic feature was verified in separate tests where a twofold increase in osmo - larity reduced the time constant by exactly a factor of one - half , as expected . Measurements of apparent water permeability ( P fapp ) were performed on at least 10 vesicles for each type of lipid . The results ( 6 SD ) are listed in Table 1 and plotted as a histogram in order of increasing unsat - uration in Fig . 4 . The apparent permeabilities were found to increase modestly with mono - and dimono - unsaturation , but incorporation of alternating cis - double bonds led to a sig - nificant augmentation of permeability . The semi - log plot in Fig . 5 demonstrates that log ( apparent permeability ) varies linearly with the reduced temperature of each lipid relative to the gel - liquid crystalline phase transition temperature reported in the literature ( Table 1 ) . Because of diffusion through unstirred layers adjacent to the bilayer , the prominent increase of permeability seen for the most unsaturated lipids ( diC18 : 2 and diC18 : 3 ) was expected to be even more pronounced than revealed by the measurements of P fapp . Conservatively , the added imped - ance is estimated by the ratio of a diffusion length set by the vesicle radius R v 5 D v / 2 ( ; 10 m m ) to the diffusivity D w of water ( ; 3 3 10 3 m m 2 / s ) , which implies that 1 / P fapp ’ 1 / P f 1 R v / D w ( Finkelstein , 1987 ; Goldstein and Dembo , 1995 ) . Based on this approximation , unstirred layers should be significant for a ; 20 - m m - size vesicle made from diC18 : 3 PC because the estimated value of P f ; 284 m m / s is much larger than the measured value P fapp ; 146 m m / s . To test the FIGURE 3 Evolution of vesicle volume with time in a water filtration experiment .

The second phase demonstrates the full recovery of volume after return to the original solution around ; 300 s . Here , the vesicle bilayer was composed of C18 : 0 / 1 PC and tested at 18°C . From measurements of vesicle dimensions inside and outside the pipette , the area of the vesicle was calculated to be ; 1940 m m 2 , and the volume was ; 11 , 200 m m 3 .

Biophysical Journal 79 ( 1 ) 321 – 327 significance of unstirred layers , a separate set of experi - ments was performed where the apparent permeabilities of diC18 : 3 vesicles were measured over the widest possible range of vesicle sizes 2 R v ; 15 – 60 m m . The reciprocal values 1 / P fapp are plotted as a function of radii in Fig . 6 . Surprisingly , the data in Fig . 6 show a more modest increase in apparent permeability with reduction in vesicle size than predicted by the simple model . Based on the linear fit to the data shown in Fig . 6 , the unstirred layer impedance was found to be ; ( 0 . 0001 s / m m 2 ) R v , which is threefold lower than the value given by R v / D w . Thus , the permeability coefficients corrected for unstirred layers would increase from P fapp ; 90 m m / s to P f ; 100 m m / s for diC18 : 2 and from P fapp ; 146 m m / s to P f ; 170 m m / s for diC18 : 3 , with negligible impact on the permeability coefficients measured for the more saturated PCs . Rupture strength Ramped upward until the vesicle ruptured , pipette suction was used to establish the tension limit for bilayer strength . The rate of tension loading was ; 0 . 1 mN / m / s . Cumulated from tests of at least 10 vesicles for each lipid type ( listed in Table 1 ) , Fig . 7 presents a histogram of the rupture tensions t m * ( 6 SD ) for PC bilayers arranged in order of increasing unsaturation . For bilayers with up to one unsaturated - double bond per chain , rupture strength varied little from t m * ; 10 mN / m . However , rupture tensions of bilayers with two or more alternating cis - double bonds ( C A C O C A C ) in one or both chains dropped precipitously to t m * ; 5 mN / m for C18 : 0 / 2 , diC18 : 2 , and even weaker— t m * ; 3 mN / m—for diC18 : 3 . Moreover , the direct stretch moduli of the bilayers were found to vary by , 6 10 % from a mean value of K A 5 243 mN / m ( see Rawicz et al . , 2000 ) ; so the fractional FIGURE 5 Log ( apparent water permeability ) versus reduced tempera - ture T r 5 ( T 2 T m ) / T m for polyunsaturated PCs at 21°C .

Clearly , two or more alternating cis - double bonds make the bilayer dis - tinctly weaker than bilayers of mono - and dimono - unsatur - ated PCs . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Water permeability Because of the sensitivity to changes in vesicle volume , aspiration into a micropipette provides a precise method to measure the transport coefficient ( permeability ) for water filtration across a single bilayer . Tested experimentally , impedance to filtration from unstirred layers was found to be much less ( ; 0 . 0001 s / m m 2 3 R v ) than predicted by the ratio of vesicle radius to water diffusivity ( ; 0 . 0003 s / m m 2 3 R v ) . As such , a bilayer permeability coefficient of ; 200 m m / s defines a reasonable upper bound accessible to mea - surement by the micropipette technique in the absence of some type of convective mixing ( e . g . , using an auxiliary pipette to blow solution past the vesicle ) . Calculated from the time course of osmotic filtration for each vesicle , the apparent permeabilities at 21°C varied modestly between 28 and 42 m m / s for mono - and dimono - unsaturated PC bilayers . Within this range , there were only subtle variations associated with position and trans or cis configurations of the double bond . However , the most striking result was that two or more alternating cis - double bonds along a chain led to major increase in apparent permeability of bilayers to water ( ; 49 m m / s for C18 : 0 / 2 , ; 90 m m / s for diC18 : 2 , and ; 146 m m / s for diC18 : 3 at 21°C ) . A similar impact of unsaturation on water permeability was found by Huster et al . ( 1997 ) . However , their values of permeability coefficient differ significantly from our measurements in Table 1 . Us - ing NMR spectroscopy to follow exchange of 17 O across membranes of ; 100 - nm - size vesicles , the measurements of Huster et al . give values of ; 123 m m / s for C18 : 0 / 1 , ; 97 m m / s for diC18 : 1 , and ; 261 m m / s for the asymmetric C18 : 0 / 3 at 21°C . The puzzling feature is the large ( ; 3 - fold ) discrepancy between their values and our values for the mono - and dimono - unsaturated PC bilayers under condi - tions where unstirred layer effects were completely negli - gible in both types of experiments . A similar discrepancy exists between our measurement of permeability coefficient ( ; 42 m m / s at 21°C ) for diC18 : 1 and the value of ; 150 m m / s obtained by Paula et al . ( 1996 ) , albeit measured at 30°C . Based on the activation energies for diC18 : 1 given in Huster et al . ( 1997 ) , the value at 21°C would only reduce to ; 91 m m / s , which remains far from our value of 42 m m / s . In comparison , Finkelstein measured the permeability of pla - nar egg PC bilayers to water at 25°C and obtained a value of ; 22 m m / s , which is consistent with the value of ; 28 m m / s we found for the closely related C18 : 0 / 1 at 21°C . Most intriguing , the values of log ( apparent permeability ) from our measurements yield a linear correlation with the reduced temperatures of these lipids relative to the gel - liquid crystalline phase transition temperatures reported in the literature , as shown in Fig . 5 . The exponential rise in permeability with increase in reduced temperature implies that free volume in the hydrocarbon region increases sig - nificantly under thermal expansion of area per lipid above the gel - liquid crystalline phase transition . This is consistent with the concept emphasized by Xiang and Anderson ( 1997 ) that the partition of solutes ( water ) in the hydrocar - bon region is strongly effected by chain - ordering , which diminishes progressively with reduced temperature in bilayers . Rupture strength Measured under a ramp of tension at a rate of ; 0 . 1 mN / m / s , mono - and dimono - unsaturated PC bilayers ruptured at nearly the same level of tension , ; 10 mN / m . But as seen in Fig . 7 , there was an major drop in bilayer strength to ; 3 – 5 mN / m when the number of unsaturated bonds in one or both hydrocarbon chains was increased from one to two or more . Although these measurements at a single rate provide a comparative assay of bilayer strength , it is important to recognize that strength is a dynamic material property that will change with the period of time subjected to different levels of tension set by tension loading rate . This follows from the accepted view that rupture of a fluid membrane emanates from formation of unstable pores . The theory for rupture pore nucleation was first proposed by Deryagin and Gutop ( 1962 ) for breakdown of thin films and is a 2 - D version of the classic theory for cavitation in 3 - D liquids introduced by Zeldovich ( 1943 ) a generation earlier . In this dynamical theory , the membrane is modeled as a simple elastic continuum where the energetics of an open hole ( radius r ) involve a constant - edge energy e ( energy / length ) 3 hole perimeter 2 p r and the applied mechanical potential t m ( p r 2 ) as expressed by E ( r ) 5 ( 2 p r ) e 2 t m ( p r 2 ) . From the model , we see that edge energy is the material property responsible for membrane strength . More subtly , however , membrane rupture is a kinetic process where the events are governed by thermally activated nucleation and thus depend on a tension - mediated energy barrier , E * 5 pe 2 / t m , which changes with time . Hence , time of exposure to changing levels of tension is important in the determina - tion of bilayer strength . Too lengthy to report here , we have recently tested the dependence of rupture tension on the time scale used to apply tension to a vesicle for most of these unsaturated PC bilayers ( Evans and Ludwig , 2000 ) . Although the results confirm the kinetic nature of the rup - ture process when examined over 10 , 000 - fold change in time scale , the measurements of rupture tension varied little in the range of plus / minus an order of magnitude above / below the rate of ; 0 . 1 mN / m / s used in this study . Thus , the lysis tensions given in Table 1 and Fig . 7 represent the 326 Olbrich et al . Biophysical Journal 79 ( 1 ) 321 – 327 levels of strength to be expected for polyunsaturated PC bilayers with 18 - carbon chains in most practical situations . APPENDIX Analysis of vesicle area and volume Changes in vesicle membrane area or volume were calculated from dis - placements in projection length inside the pipette L p using the geometric relations for total area and volume of an aspirated vesicle . Because the pressurized shape of a fluid bilayer vesicle is a perfect sphere , the relations depend only on the diameter D v of the vesicle - spherical segment outside the pipette , the internal diameter of the pipette D p , and the projection length : i . e . , ( 1 ) Hemispherical cap and cylindrical portion of the projection inside the pipette , A cap 5 p D p2 / 2 A cyl 5 p D p ~ L p 2 D p / 2 !

Then , using these values , changes in either area ( for the volume V tot held constant ) or volume ( for the area A tot held constant ) were calculated from the measurements of displacements in projection length L p , where the geometric constraint was used to relate the instantaneous diameter D v of the spherical segment to projection length .
