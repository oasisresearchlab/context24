Here , we mapped chromatin genome - wide in a large and diverse collection of human tissues and stem cells . The maps yield unprecedented annotations of functional genomic elements and their regulation across devel - opmental stages , lineages , and cellular environ - ments . They also reveal global features of the epigenome , related to nuclear architecture , that also vary across cellular phenotypes . Speciﬁcally , developmental speciﬁcation is accompanied by pro - gressive chromatin restriction as the default state transitions from dynamic remodeling to generalized compaction . Exposure to serum in vitro triggers a distinct transition that involves de novo estab - lishment of domains with features of constitutive heterochromatin . We describe how these global chromatin state transitions relate to chromosome and nuclear architecture , and discuss their implica - tions for lineage ﬁdelity , cellular senescence , and reprogramming . INTRODUCTION Since the initial sequencing of the human genome a decade ago , our understanding of the primary DNA sequence has advanced profoundly ( Lander , 2011 ) . Sequence signals and multispecies conservation have enabled precise annotation of protein coding genes and the identiﬁcation of increasing numbers of noncoding RNAs , regulatory elements , and motifs . Systematic genotyping studies have identiﬁed common variants associated with complex diseases and recurrent mutations that confer growth advantage in cancer . However , entirely sequence - directed investigations cannot address the fundamental question of how one genome can give rise to a large and phenotypically diverse collection of cells and tissues during embryonic development . Nor can they explain how environmental conditions further shape these phenotypes and affect disease risks ( Feinberg , 2007 ) . An under - standing of the regulatory networks and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie context - speciﬁc gene expression programs and cellular phenotypes remains a critical scientiﬁc goal with broad implications for human health . Genomic DNA is organized into chromatin , which adopts characteristic conﬁgurations when DNA interacts with transcrip - tion factors ( TFs ) , RNA polymerase , or other regulators ( Mar - gueron and Reinberg , 2010 ) . Charting these conﬁgurations with genome - wide maps of histone modiﬁcations ( ‘‘chromatin state maps’’ ) thus represents an effective means for identifying 642 Cell 152 , 642 – 654 , January 31 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . functional DNA elements and assessing their activities in a given cell population ( Zhou et al . , 2011 ) . Signature patterns of ‘‘active’’ chromatin marks demarcate poised or active promoters , tran - scribed regions , and candidate enhancers . Other modiﬁcations reveal distinct modes of chromatin repression , such as those mediated by Polycomb regulators or heterochromatin proteins . Recent studies have applied chromatin proﬁling to charac - terize enhancer dynamics and epigenetic regulatory mecha - nisms in differentiation , cellular reprogramming , and disease processes ( Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Hawkins et al . , 2010b ; ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) . However , the overwhelming focus of such studies on in vitro cells has constrained our ability to detect and characterize regulatory elements in the human genome and to understand how global features of the epige - nome impact cellular phenotypes across different lineages , developmental stages , and environmental conditions . Here , we present a resource of over 300 chromatin state maps for a phenotypically diverse collection of human tissues , blood lineages , and stem cells , produced by the NIH Roadmap Epige - nomics Mapping Consortium ( Bernstein et al . , 2010 ) . The maps depict the distributions of major histone modiﬁcations and provide a systematic view of the dynamic chromatin landscapes of in vivo tissues . We use the maps to identify and characterize (cid:1) 400 , 000 cell - type - speciﬁc distal regulatory elements , many of which can be tied to upstream TFs or signaling pathways and whose activity patterns provide a precise ﬁngerprint of cell phenotype . We also describe global chromatin state transitions that distinguish groups of cells representative of different devel - opmental stages or environmental conditions and investigate their implications for lineage ﬁdelity , nuclear architecture , cellu - lar senescence , and reprogramming . This extensive catalog of in vivo chromatin states thus presents a unique resource of genomic annotations for biomedical research along with novel epigenetic features that vary markedly across cellular states . RESULTS Charting Chromatin Landscapes of Human Tissues , Blood Lineages , and Stem Cells We acquired chromatin state maps for 29 tissues and cell types spanning a wide range of developmental stages , lineages , and derivations ( Figure 1A ) . We used chromatin immunoprecip - itation and high - throughput sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) to map histone modiﬁcations associated with diverse regulatory and epigenetic functions , including H3K4me1 ( H3 lysine 4 mono - methylation ) , H3K4me3 , H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 , H3K36me3 , H3K9ac ( lysine 9 acetylation ) , and H3K27ac . Procedures were optimized for different tissue preparations and to accommodate for limiting samples ( Experimental Procedures ) . We also incor - porated data sets for in vitro cultured cells into our analysis ( Ernst et al . , 2011 ) . The resource contains over 300 chromatin state maps that signiﬁcantly expand coverage of the human epige - nome ( Table S1 available online ) . All data sets were publically released upon veriﬁcation at www . roadmapepigenomics . org and are also available at http : / / www . broadinstitute . org / pubs / epigenomicsresource . We applied automated methods to characterize the chromatin landscapes and relate them to underlying cellular phenotypes . First , we clustered the proﬁles based on pair - wise correlations ( Figure 1B ) . The modiﬁcations organize into separate clusters , reﬂecting their associations to distinct genomic features . Modiﬁ - cations associated with promoter ( H3K4me3 , H3K9ac ) , tran - script ( H3K36me3 ) , and distal element ( H3K4me1 , H3K27ac ) activity correlate positively with one another but show vary - ing degrees of exclusivity with repressive marks ( H3K27me3 , H3K9me3 ) . Next , we used principal component analysis ( PCA ) to measure and visualize differences between cell types . Treating each his - tone modiﬁcation separately , we computed weighted combina - tions of enrichment levels in genomic windows ( PC1 , PC2 , and PC3 ) that capture a large proportion of the variation between cell types ( Figure S1 ; Experimental Procedures ) . The PCA shows a striking capacity to segregate cells and tissues based on fundamental characteristics as seen in 3D projections of PC coordinates ( Figure 1C ) . This is particularly evident for modiﬁca - tions associated with regulatory activity ( H3K4me1 , H3K27ac ) , which distinguish ﬁve groups of phenotypically related tissue and cell types ( see Patterns and Determinants of Regulatory Activity and Potential in the Human Genome below ) . PC projec - tions for several modiﬁcations are notable for stark translations of certain cellular groups along PC1 , indicative of major differ - ences in chromatin state . In particular , the marked separation of pluripotent stem cells from other cell and tissue types evident in the H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 projections portends a global reorganization that accompanies developmental speciﬁcation ( see Developmental Speciﬁcation Is Associated with Progres - sive Chromatin Restriction ) . Furthermore , a clear separation of cultured cells in the H3K9me3 projection signiﬁes a distinct reorganization induced by in vitro culture ( see Culture Environ - ments Trigger Macroscale Chromatin State Changes ) . The PCA also provides a general tool for comparing newly characterized cell types against representative chromatin state maps in this resource . Patterns and Determinants of Regulatory Activity and Potential in the Human Genome Enhancers and other distal regulatory elements are critical for context - speciﬁc gene regulation but have yet to be systemati - cally charted in primary human cells and tissues . Such elements are associated with characteristic chromatin marks , including H3K4me1 and H3K27ac , which facilitate their identiﬁcation ( Bulger and Groudine , 2011 ; Hawkins et al . , 2010b ) . We annotated candidate regulatory elements by calling H3K4me1 peaks in 30 cell types . After ﬁltering out peaks that overlap a transcription start site ( TSS ) , we identiﬁed an average of (cid:1) 94 , 000 distal sites per cell type . Integrating all sites marked by H3K4me1 in at least two cell types reveals (cid:1) 377 , 000 putative distal regulatory elements , with a median size of 1 . 2 kb . The elements are highly tissue - speciﬁc , with 56 % marked in three or fewer cell types . Clustering on H3K4me1 patterns revealed 23 major clusters of elements with related cell - type speciﬁcities ( Figure 2A ) . The biological relevance of individual clusters is sup - ported by the identities of proximal genes , which are expressed at higher levels in the corresponding cell types and enriched for related functional annotations ( Table S2 ; Experimental Proce - dures ) . Roughly half of all H3K4me1 sites also carry H3K27ac Cell 152 , 642 – 654 , January 31 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 643 in at least a subset of cell types and thus represent candidate enhancers ( Figure 2B ) . Notably , nearly half of the candidate enhancers are speciﬁc to in vivo tissues , blood lineages , or brain sections . To identify underlying sequence determinants , we scanned the candidate enhancers for TF consensus motifs . We identiﬁed signiﬁcantly enriched motifs for each of the 23 clusters of commonly regulated elements ( Figure 2A , Table S3 ; Experi - mental Procedures ) . The corresponding motif instances tend to be highly conserved and to coincide with dips in the chromatin proﬁles indicative of TF interactions ( He et al . , 2010 ) . A sampling of predicted TF - motif interactions were also veriﬁed using TF - binding data ( Figure S2 ; ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) . The data implicate known and potentially novel roles for speciﬁc TFs as regulators of cell - type - speciﬁc distal elements and gene expression programs . To highlight one example , brain - and neural - stem - cell - speciﬁc elements are enriched for NF1 , RFX , SOX2 , SOX10 , and E - box motifs ( Figure 2A ; clusters 18 – 20 ) . In several cases , a given TF motif is enriched in multiple unrelated clusters and thus implicated under distinct cellular contexts . A case in point is SOX2 , a multifunctional TF with roles in pluripo - tent stem cells and neural lineages . The SOX2 motif is enriched in pluripotent - ( cluster 9 ) and neural - speciﬁc ( cluster 20 ) distal elements , suggesting that speciﬁcity among these clusters may involve proximal sequence signals . Indeed , 25 % of SOX2 motifs in ‘‘pluripotent’’ elements coincide with OCT4 motifs , whereas a majority of SOX2 motifs in ‘‘neural’’ elements instead coincide with PAX2 motifs . Further complexity is evident at the level of enhancer usage as many loci contain multiple elements whose activity patterns vary even between cell types in which nearby genes are active ( Figure 2C ) . These and other examples suggest a prominent role for combinatorial TF activities and complex distal element patterning in directing gene expression programs in human cells ( Bulger and Groudine , 2011 ) . In addition to lineage - speciﬁc TFs , the motif enrichments implicate signaling and environmental response pathways acti - vated in speciﬁc contexts . Clusters of distal elements broadly associated with primary cells cultured in serum are enriched for motifs recognized by AP - 1 ( clusters 12 – 14 ) , a classical inte - grator of extrinsic growth stimuli and environmental stress ( Angel A B 3em72K3H 1em4K3H C −1 −0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 H3K9me3 H3K27me3 H3K36me3 H3K4me3 H3K4me1 H3K27ac H 3 K 9 m e3 H 3 K 27 m e3 H 3 K 36 m e3 H 3 K 4 m e3 H 3 K 4 m e1 H 3 K 27a c H3K9ac H 3 K 9a c 0 . 57 0 . 52 0 . 75 0 . 85 0 . 73 0 . 49 0 . 45 NPC Neurons P C 1 P C 2 P C 3 P C 3 P C 2 P C 1 Pluripotent Brain Culture Tissues Blood P C 2 P C 3 P C 1 P C 3 P C 2 P C 1 3em9K3H ca72K3H Embryonic stem cells ( 4 lines ) Induced pluripotent cells ( 3 lines ) ES - derived cells ( neurons , neural progenitors ) Primary cells in culture environment Lymphoblastoids Endothelium Mammaryepithelium Fibroblasts Keratinocytes Myoblasts Muscle Primary cells and tissues ( in vivo ) Anterior caudate Cingulate gyrus Hippocampus middle Inferior temporal lobe Mid - frontal lobe Substantia nigra CD19 + B - cells CD3 + T - cells CD34 + progenitors B l ood Rectal smooth muscle Stomach smooth muscle Duodenal mucosa Colonic mucosa Skeletal muscle AdiposeLiver T i s s u es Pluripotent stem cells and differentiatedprogeny B r a i n sec t i on s Rectal mucosa Figure 1 .

A related cluster is also enriched for the p53 motif ( cluster 13 ) , consistent with documented activation of p53 senescence programs in these primary cell models ( Rhein - wald et al . , 2002 ) . The large number and diverse activity patterns of distal elements prompted us to examine their global distributions . We calculated the proportion of the genome that lies within 50 kb of an H3K4me1 + element in each cell type . This proportion A B C D Figure 2 .

Clusters of distal elements with similar cell - type speciﬁcities ( horizontallines ) are enrichedfor the indicated TF motifs ( right ) . The data emphasize the importance of tissue diversity for understanding distal regulatory elements , a large fraction of which is speciﬁc to in vivo tissues .

Although EBF1 is expressed in neurons and CD19 + B cells , distal H3K4me1 patterns vary markedly between these cell types . Similarly , HLF and MMD are expressed in liver , muscle , and CD34 + progenitors , despite stark differences in distal element patterning . ( D ) Bar graphs show the proportions of genome within 50 kb of an H3K4me1 site ( top ) or within an H3K36me3 interval ( bottom ) . Values represent averages for each cell group . The prevalence and distribution of H3K4me1 sites suggest that pluripotent cells have more accessible chromatin , but H3K36me3 patterns suggest that total gene activity is similar to other cells . See also Figure S2 and Tables S2 and S3 . Cell 152 , 642 – 654 , January 31 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 645 remains relatively constant at (cid:1) 50 % across the differentiated tissues and cell types . However , H3K4me1 sites are more prevalent and dispersed in pluripotent cells , such that a full 85 % of the genome is within 50 kb of a site ( Figure 2D ) . This pattern does not appear to reﬂect increased gene activity as the proportion of genome marked by H3K36me3 in pluripotent cells ( (cid:1) 17 % ) is similar to the average for differentiated cells ( (cid:1) 23 % ) . Moreover , the proportion of elements with concomitant H3K27ac is notably lower for H3K4me1 sites in pluripotent stem cells ( Figure 2B ) , indicating that many may represent ‘‘poised’’ enhancers or other sites of accessible chromatin . Thus , much of the genome in pluripotent cells appears to be coincident or proximal to accessible chromatin . Pluripotent Cell Chromatin Is Refractory to Polycomb - Repressed State The dramatically reduced prevalence of accessible chromatin in differentiated cells prompted us to test for concomitant changes in repressive chromatin . We focused on marks associ - ated with Polycomb - repression ( H3K27me3 ) and constitutive heterochromatin ( H3K9me3 ) . Both modiﬁcations contribute to stable gene repression through interactions with protein com - plexes involved in chromatin compaction ( Margueron and Rein - berg , 2010 ; Simon and Kingston , 2009 ) . The PCA statistics ( Figure 1C ) indicate that , like H3K4me1 , global H3K27me3 patterns are distinct in pluripotent cells . Indeed , we ﬁnd that the changes in H3K4me1 patterns are com - plemented by a profound reorganization of the H3K27me3 land - scape . In embryonic ( ES ) and induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells , this surrogate of Polycomb activity is conﬁned to peaks at ‘‘bivalent’’ GC - rich promoters that also carry H3K4me3 . This punctate pattern contrasts with a much broader distribution of H3K27me3 in differentiated cells and tissues ( Figure 3A ) . We used a customized approach to quantify coverage in each cell type ( Figures 3B and S3 ; Experimental Procedures ) . This conﬁrmed that H3K27me3 affects a considerably larger propor - tion of genome in differentiated cells ( (cid:1) 40 % ) than pluripotent cells ( (cid:1) 8 % ) . This dramatic shift is supported by western blots showing that acid - extracted histones from differentiated cells have higher H3K27me3 levels than similar extracts from ES cells ( Figure S3 ) . The focal distribution of H3K27me3 in pluripotent cells could reﬂect reduced Polycomb activity . However , EZH2 and other Polycomb factors are highly expressed in ES cells . This led us to consider an alternate model in which the highly dynamic chro - matin in pluripotent cells ( Meshorer et al . , 2006 ) is refractory to the compaction associated with Polycomb repression . To explore this , we mapped H2A . Z , a histone variant associated with nucleosome exchange and remodeling ( Talbert and Henik - off , 2010 ) , in representative cell types ( Figures 3C , 3D , and S3 ) . Consistent with prior studies ( Hardy et al . , 2009 ) , H2A . Z is depleted within elongating transcripts in all cell types exam - ined . However , the global H2A . Z distribution diverges markedly between pluripotent and differentiated cells . In ES and iPS cells , the variant marks promoters and distal elements , but is also distributed throughout intergenic regions . In differentiated cells , H2A . Z is instead conﬁned to promoters and distal elements . The broad H2A . Z distribution suggests that chromatin exchange is prevalent throughout the genome in embryonic cells . Although H2A . Z may be compatible with punctate Polycomb sites in ES cells ( Creyghton et al . , 2008 ) , dynamic chromatin is likely incom - patible with the stable interactions required for Polycomb spreading and compaction ( Simon and Kingston , 2009 ) . Thus , pervasive exchange may underlie the constrained H3K27me3 distribution and the uniquely accessible chromatin landscape in pluripotent cells . Developmental Speciﬁcation Is Associated with Progressive Chromatin Restriction To gain insight into the timing of the developmental transition , we proﬁled H3K27me3 in a series of cell populations representing successive stages of speciﬁcation . These include ( 1 ) embryoid bodies ( EBs ) isolated from differentiating ES cells at day 4 , ( 2 ) EBs isolated at day 9 , ( 3 ) neural progenitors derived from ES cells through a 3 week differentiation procedure , and ( 4 ) neurons differentiated from these progenitors . We found that ES cell differentiation is accompanied by progressive enrichment of H3K27me3 across the genome , with subtle but signiﬁcant changes in EBs , and profound alterations in neural progenitors and neurons ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . The latter populations exhibit a diffuse H3K27me3 distribution akin to other differentiated cell types . This suggests that reorganization of the chromatin land - scape begins early in development and is recapitulated by in vitro differentiation of ES cells . We next examined the locations and characteristics of genomic loci that gain H3K27me3 in the differentiated popula - tions . We focused on a set of (cid:1) 3 , 000 loci ( 100 kb size ) with variable activity across the phenotypic groups . We scored each locus for ( 1 ) distal element H3K4me1 levels , ( 2 ) promoter H3K4me3 levels , ( 3 ) transcript H3K36me3 levels , and ( 4 ) overall H3K27me3 levels within each phenotypic group , and clustered them accordingly ( Figure 4A ; Experimental Procedures ) . The re - sulting cluster diagram conveys the variable patterning of these loci . Promoter , transcript , and distal element activities are highly concordant within a given locus but correlate negatively with the extentofH3K27me3coverage . Thesepatternsprovideasystem - atic view of how Polycomb - repressed chromatin is engaged in speciﬁc lineages to maintain silencing of gene loci with functions in alternate lineages . Chromatin restriction can also proceed beyond this initial developmental reorganization , under certain contexts . In par - ticular , the brain sections exhibit uniquely high H3K27me3 coverage over intergenic regions , relative to annotated genes ( Figure 4B ) . Expansion of the Polycomb - repressed state is accompanied by a dramatic restriction of accessible chromatin , such that (cid:1) 70 % of H3K4me1 sites in brain reside within tran - scriptional units ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . To test the generality of this ﬁnding , we examined H3K4me1 proﬁles for assorted mouse tissues ( Shen et al . , 2012 ) . Out of 19 cell and tissue types exam - ined , we found that cerebellum and cortex have the highest proportions of H3K4me1 sites within genic regions ( Figure S3 ) . The brain sections are unique among tissues in the resource in that they comprise specialized , terminally differentiated cell types—primarily neurons and glial cells . We reasoned that the restrictive chromatin environment in these cells might obstruct access to intergenic sequences and thus favor recognition of 646 Cell 152 , 642 – 654 , January 31 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc .

In support of this possibility , we ﬁnd that the genes with a high density of conserved noncod - ing sequences in their introns are expressed at higher levels in brain and enriched for functional annotations related to neuronal physiology ( Figure 4D ; Experimental Procedures ) . In summary , our data suggest that developmental speciﬁca - tion is accompanied by a striking transition from a permissive chromatin state with widespread remodeling to a restrictive state with pervasive Polycomb repression . Chromatin restriction may also proceed signiﬁcantly further in certain specialized cells , with brain sections in particular exhibiting severe sequestration of intergenic sequences and evidence for preferential utilization of regulatory elements within introns . Relating Macroscale Chromatin Features to Nuclear Architecture The coarse partitioning of the genome between loci of coordi - nated gene regulatory activity and large Polycomb - repressed regions prompted us to investigate macroscale patterns of histone modiﬁcation .

These data suggest that a highly restrictive chromatin structure in specialized brain cells favors access to intronic regions and may inﬂuence the function of sequence elements that mediate corresponding regulatory programs .

Several lines of evidence suggest that the macroscale chro - matin patterns reﬂect chromosomal and nuclear architecture . The chromatin states align with chromosome banding patterns , with active ( 1 ) and inactive states ( 2 – 4 ) , respectively , enriched in light and dark bands . All three inactive states are also enriched for contacts with the nuclear lamina ( Guelen et al . , 2008 ) . We also examined the relationship between the macroscale chro - matin domains and chromosomal interactions ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) . The interaction maps indicate that the genome can be partitioned into two compartments such that contacts within each compartment are enriched and contacts between compart - ments are depleted . We found that the chromatin state - based classiﬁcation scheme mirrors the HiC compartmentalization , with active states coinciding with one compartment and repres - sive states with the other ( Figure 5 ) . In fact , the chromatin states enable prediction of HiC compartments with an overall accuracy of 83 % . These correspondences suggest that macroscale chro - matin patterns are reﬂective of chromosomal and nuclear archi - tectureandthatthecompendiumofchromatinmapsmaythereby provideinsightintoarchitecturalchangesbetweencellularstates . Culture Environments Trigger Macroscale Chromatin State Changes Although the macroscale chromatin patterns are each recovered in all of the differentiated cell types , one conﬁguration—the pure H3K9me3 state—varies markedly in its prevalence . It is rare in brain sections and other in vivo models but (cid:1) 50 - fold more prevalent in cultured primary cells ( Figure S4 ) . Visual inspec - tion of the proﬁles conﬁrms expansive regions of modest but contiguous H3K9me3 enrichment that are particularly pro - nounced in cultured cells ( Figure 6A ) . We called H3K9me3 - enriched intervals in each cell type and merged overlapping intervals to collate a set of 296 domains ( median size 1 . 4 Mb ) . We then calculated normalized H3K9me3 signals for each domain in each cell type and clustered the domains accordingly ( Experimental Procedures ) . Two clusters comprise constitutive H3K9me3 domains ( Fig - ure 6B , clusters VI , VII ; Table S4 ) . The corresponding loci include olfactory receptor , zinc ﬁnger , and protocadherin gene clusters and several imprinted loci , which have previously been associ - ated with H3K9me3 ( Magklara et al . , 2011 ; O’Geen et al . , 2007 ) . The remaining clusters comprise domains with variable enrichments across the cell types . These domains tend to be near telomeres ( cluster I ) , AT rich ( cluster II – IV ) , gene poor ( clus - ters I – IV ) , and in contact with the nuclear lamina . Their H3K9me3 signals are most pronounced in in vitro cultured cells , such as endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , keratinocytes ( NHEK ) and ﬁbroblasts ( NHLF ) ( Figure 6B ; clusters I – IV ) . Preferential association of vari - able H3K9me3 domains with the culture environment is further supported by a direct comparison of surgically resected skeletal muscle against cultured skeletal muscle cells ( Figure S4 ) . Although they are representative of different lineages , the cell types with pronounced H3K9me3 domains are all grown as adherent cultures in the presence of serum or other potent growth stimuli . By contrast , hematopoietic cells grown in sus - pension and stem cells grown in deﬁned media without serum lack the variable H3K9me3 domains . Growth stimuli have previously been linked to global chromatin changes . Trans - forming growth factor b ( TGF - b ) - mediated epithelial - to - mesen - chymal transition ( EMT ) leads to a global increase in euchromatin marks and a reduction in the lamina - associated modiﬁcation , H3K9me2 ( Guelen et al . , 2008 ; McDonald et al . , 2011 ) . Although we ﬁnd that the genome - wide patterns of H3K9me3 and H3K9me2 are distinct ( Figure S4 ) , we nonetheless considered whether the culture - induced H3K9me3 domains might relate to EMT - like nuclear architecture changes . In support of this possibility , we found that inhibition of TGF - b signaling in WI - 38 ﬁbroblasts leads to a reduction in H3K9me3 domain signals ( Figure S4 ) . Furthermore , EMT and serum - exposure both lead to subtle increases in the median expression of genes under - lying H3K9me3 domains ( Figure 6E ) . Finally , we note that the H3K9me3 domains occupy the same inactive compartment as the nuclear lamina in the chromatin interaction data ( Figures 5 and 6B ) . These ﬁndings are suggestive of a model in which growth stimuli in culture media promote alterations to nuclear architecture and lamina contacts that render formerly inert loci susceptible to H3K9me3 modiﬁcation . In addition to having related growth environments , the affected models are all nontransformed , primary cells that will undergo senescence - related growth arrest ( Figure S4 ) . Cellular senescence is also associated with global architecture changes—speciﬁcally , the formation of ‘‘senescence - associ - ated heterochromatin foci ( SAHFs ) , ’’ which are DAPI - dense C h r o m a t i n s t a t e s N u c l ea r a r c h i t e c t u r e Open HiC compartment Close HiC compartment Nuclear lamina contact H3K36me3 H3K4me1 H3K27me3 H3K9me3 I II III IV Figure 5 .

Moreover , oncogene - induced senes - cence is dependent on the H3K9 methyltransferase Suv39h1 ( Braig et al . , 2005 ) . We tested whether Suv39h1 mediates the culture - speciﬁc domains by proﬁling H3K9me3 in ﬁbroblasts after shRNA knockdown . We observed markedly reduced H3K9me3 in the culture - speciﬁc domains , indicating that Suv39h1 is required for their maintenance ( Figures 6C and 6D ) . We suggest that context - speciﬁc induction of H3K9me3 domains by Suv39h1 in cells subjected to growth stimuli in nonphysiologic environments may underlie their vulnerability to senescence - associated chromatin changes ( see Discussion ) .

In contrast to the primary cell models , ES and iPS cells lack the variable H3K9me3 domains ( Figure 6B ) . Because iPS cells are typically derived from cultured ﬁbroblasts , this implies that chromatin in these regions is repaired during cellular reprogram - ming . However , evidence suggests that the domains may be repaired inefﬁciently and thus present an impediment to reprog - ramming . Speciﬁcally , recent studies have highlighted more than 20 ‘‘hot spots’’ of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming that frequently exhibit aberrant DNA methylation patterns in iPS cells , relative to ES cells ( Lister et al . , 2011 ; Ruiz et al . , 2012 ) . Remarkably , we ﬁnd that essentially all of these hot spots overlap regions with H3K9me3 domains in differentiated cells ( Figure 6B ) . Recent work has also shown that suppression of Suv39h1 enhances reprogramming ( Onder et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , although H3K9me3 patterns are largely reset in iPS cells , the culture - speciﬁc domains may present a barrier to reprogram - ming and potentially retain a memory of architectural aberrations in the preprogrammed donor cell . DISCUSSION Discerning the principles by which a single genome can give rise to a multiplicity of cellular states remains a critical goal . Model organism studies have presented paradigms by which interactions among TFs , epigenetic regulators , and genome sequence elements mediate lineage - speciﬁc gene expression and dynamic responses to environmental stimuli . Yet our under - standing of these components and their functions in humans has lagged , with limited existing knowledge derived largely from in vitro models . This study aimed to characterize systematically the sequence elements , regulators , andepigeneticstatesthatmodulatehuman genome function in native contexts . We mapped chromatin statesacrossadiversecollectionofinvivopopulations , including blood lineages , brain sections , gastrointestinal tissues , adipose , liver , and muscle , and compared them to pluripotent and differ - entiating stem cells and other in vitro counterparts . We used the maps to locate and classify regulatory sequences and to characterize large - scale epigenetic states and their dynamics across a breadth of cellular phenotypes . The distal element annotations extend prior studies of in vitro cells with a broad survey of in vivo tissues . Integration of genome - wide proﬁles for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac across 30 cell and tissue types yielded nearly 400 , 000 putative distal elements , roughly half of which have enhancer - like chromatin patterns . The elements show exquisite tissue speciﬁcity , with most showing activity in just a few cell types . By analyzing their tissue speciﬁcities and the underlying DNA sequences , we predict upstream factors that drive genome regulatory programs in speciﬁc cellular contexts . These include master regulator TFs that dictate speciﬁc lineages , as well as regulators such as AP1 whose activity patterns appear to reﬂect increased mitogenic signaling triggered by the culture environment . The large propor - tion of candidate enhancers speciﬁc to in vivo tissues should be valuable for human genetics given their potential to facilitate the identiﬁcation and interpretation of causal sequence variants from genome - wide association studies ( Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Gaul - ton et al . , 2010 ; ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) . Our study also helps resolve controversy regarding how chro - matin is reorganized during developmental speciﬁcation . Prior studies have been equivocal with regard to whether speciﬁcation involves expansion of repressive chromatin domains or , alterna - tively , is dominated by localized state changes ( Hawkins et al . , 2010a ; Lienert et al . , 2011 ; Wen et al . , 2009 ) . We critically ad - dressed this issue by comparing the distributions of multiple histone modiﬁcations and a marker of chromatin exchange across tissues and cells at various stages of commitment . We implemented a statistical model to quantify differences in the chromatin landscapes and veriﬁed inferences by measuring global modiﬁcation levels with western blots . We conclude that speciﬁcation is accompanied by a stark transition in the epigenetic landscape from a uniquely accessible state to increasingly restrictive conﬁgurations ( Figure 7 ) . In embryonic cells , active and inactive loci both appear subject to dynamic chromatin remodeling that is likely incompatible with repressive chromatin compaction ( Simon and Kingston , 2009 ) . Accordingly , the Polycomb mark is largely conﬁned to poised promoters in ES and iPS cells . Differentiated cells present an inverse pattern , with chromatin exchange conﬁned to loci under active regulation and much of the remaining landscape affected by Polycomb repression . Our ﬁndings build upon prior reports of expanded H3K27me3 domains in differentiated cells ( Hawkins et al . , 2010a ; Pauler et al . , 2009 ) and suggest a prominent role for hyperdynamic chromatin in pluripotent cells as a hindrance to stable silencing ( Meshorer et al . , 2006 ) . However , our analyses do not support prior claims that expanded H3K9me3 domains arise upon speciﬁcation , as we ﬁnd that such features are instead triggered by the culture environment ( see below ) . Further study is needed to clarify how developmental and environmental cues alter H3K9me2 patterns , which appear distinct from the other repressive states . In certain contexts , chromatin restriction can proceed well beyond the primary transition that accompanies lineage commit - ment . Case in point is the brain sections wherein intergenic regions are almost entirely covered by Polycomb - repressed chromatin and , conversely , a large majority of accessible chro - matin sites occur within genes . The brain samples are composed of neurons , glia , and other highly specialized cell types that may be permissive to the accumulation of repressive chromatin . A corollary of the chromatin patterns is that intronic regulatory elements may be more accessible and more readily engaged in such cells . Indeed , we ﬁnd that introns of genes with neuronal functions have a relatively higher density of conserved noncod - ing sequence elements , raising the provocative concept that ep - igenomic landscapes shape the evolution of genome sequence . Chromatin architecture changes have also been associated with cellular responses to environmental cues , yet their inﬂu - ences on speciﬁc genomic loci have remained vague . Here , we describe a set of megabase - sized H3K9me3 domains that arise in primary cultured cells but which are rare or absent in tissues , blood lineages , and stem cells ( Figure 7 ) . The domains likely reﬂect nuclear architecture changes as they correspond to gene - poor regions that contact the lamina and occupy the same inactive compartment . Prior indications that TGF - b - medi - ated EMT and cellular senescence perturb nuclear architecture prompted us to examine whether the culture - speciﬁc domains Cell 152 , 642 – 654 , January 31 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 651 might relate to such processes ( Adams , 2007 ; McDonald et al . , 2011 ) . We found that EMT modestly increases the expression of genes within the domains and , moreover , that TGF - b inhibition lowers their H3K9me3 signals . The domains are dependent on Suv39h1 , a histone methyltransferase that mediates onco - gene - induced senescence ( Braig et al . , 2005 ) . Cellular senes - cence is associated with the formation of nuclear foci ( SAHFs ) that stain for H3K9me3 and are thought to arise by rearrange - ment of pre - existing regions of histone modiﬁcation ( Chandra et al . , 2012 ) . We speculate that H3K9me3 domains represent an initial response to growth stimuli and nonphysiologic environ - ments that primes cells for senescence - associated events . Regardless , the direct identiﬁcation of genomic regions as candidate targets of EMT and presenescence changes should facilitate the study of processes that are fundamental to human health , aging and cancer . The fate of culture - speciﬁc H3K9me3 domains during cellular reprogramming presents an interesting question . Although they are prominent in ﬁbroblasts , the domains appear to be erased during reprogramming , as they are absent in iPS cells . Yet the domains contain within them essentially all of differentially - meth - ylated regions found to distinguish iPS cells from ES cells , which have not undergone reprogramming ( Lister et al . , 2011 ; Ruiz et al . , 2012 ) . Somatic cell reprogramming is enhanced by inhibi - tion of TGF - b signaling and suppression of the H3K9 methyl - transferase Suv39h1 ( Maherali and Hochedlinger , 2009 ; Onder et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , H3K9me3 heterochromatin domains have recently been found to impede the initial binding of plurip - otency TFs during this process ( Souﬁ et al . , 2012 ) . These correspondences raise the intriguing possibility that H3K9me3 domains present a hindrance to reprogramming and possibly retain an epigenetic memory of presenescence changes in the donor cell . Although further study is clearly needed to appreciate their signiﬁcance , the identiﬁcation and initial characterization of these macroscale chromatin aberrations provides a starting point for such investigations . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Data Access All data sets were publically released upon veriﬁcation at www . roadmapepigenomics . org and are available at NCBI’s GEO database ( GSE17312 , GSE19465 and GSE25249 ) and a dedicated website http : / / www . broadinstitute . org / pubs / epigenomicsresource . Sample Acquisition and Production Mapping ES and iPS cell lines were cultured in serum - replacement media ( Bock et al . , 2011 ; Boulting et al . , 2011 ) . EBs were generated by in vitro differentiation of H9 ES cells in low attachment plates in EB differentiation media . Neural progenitors and neurons were derived from H9 ES cells by in vitro differentia - tion for 3 and 5 weeks , respectively ( Dhara and Stice , 2008 ) . Blood lineages were isolated from cord or peripheral bloods . Liver , adipose , skeletal muscle , and gastrointestinal tissues were harvested at surgical resection . Brain sections were obtained postmortem within hours of death . Tissue and cell preparations were subjected to ChIP - seq , as described ( Adli et al . , 2010 ; Ku et al . , 2008 ) . Aligned reads were used to derive 25 bp resolution density maps . Noncentered PCA was carried out on each modi - ﬁcation separately based on the number of reads in all nonoverlapping 1 kb windows . Detailed descriptions are presented in Extended Experimental Procedures . Distal Regulatory Element and Repressive Chromatin States We used a scanning window approach to call H3K4me1 and H3K27ac peaks ( Guttman et al . , 2010 ) . After excluding sites within 2 . 5 kb of a TSS , we desig - nated H3K4me1 sites as candidate distal elements and clustered ( K - means ) them by their cell - type speciﬁcities . We quantiﬁed their predictive power for gene activity by correlating the state of each element and the expression of the nearest TSS . We scanned the distal element clusters for over - represented Figure 7 .
