A consequence of this assumption is that cells obey the Boyle van’t Hoff ( BvH ) law which states that cell volumes are a linear function of reciprocal osmolality . Extrapolation of the BvH plot to inﬁnite osmolality yields a quantity b , the fractional volume of the cell occupied by sol - ids . In many cells , however , a cell volume excursion above the isotonic volume initiates an energy - requir - ing response that causes the swollen cells to shrink back to or towards isotonic volume . It is referred to as regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) . We have observed a strong RVD in COS - 7 cells . If not eliminated by keeping exposure times short , this RVD produces a b that is 60 % too high ( 0 . 48 vs . 0 . 30 ) . These results indicate the importance of examining cells for volume regulatory mechanisms before performing mea - surements to determine their osmotic parameters . (cid:3) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc . The response of cells to subzero temperatures depends to a ma - jor degree on their inherent osmotic properties and on the perme - abilties of their plasma membranes to water and to solutes . In predicting and analyzing these responses , a fundamental underly - ing assumption is that the movement of water and solutes in and out of cells is totally passive and is solely in response to chemical potential differences between the cell and its exterior and at rates that are proportional to the magnitude of those differences . Essen - tially all animal cells swell or shrink in hypotonic or hypertonic solutions of nonpermeating solutes to a volume predicted by the Boyle van’t Hoff law . At 0 (cid:2) C and below , the enlarged or shrunken volume is maintained if the deviation from isotonicity is not dam - aging . For many cells that is also true between 20 and 37 (cid:2) C ; how - ever , many other cells possess energy - driven volume regulatory responses which drive the cell volumes back close to the volume in isotonic conditions [ 10 , 14 ] . In the case of a hypoosmotically in - duced swelling , this reaction is called a regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) . In the case of the re - swelling of a hyperosmotically shrun - ken cell , it is called a regulatory volume increase ( RVI ) . If volume regulatory responses occur within the time frame of above - zero procedures used in cryobiology , it can confound or overwhelm the passive water and solute ﬂows determined by differences in chemical potential . Such is the case in COS - 7 ﬁbroblast cells , re - ported here . When exposed to a hypotonic medium , they initially and rapidly swell to a volume predicted by the physical chemical law , but if they are held in that medium , they return to normal iso - tonic volume within 30 min . The purpose of the current paper is several fold : ( 1 ) To document the extent and rapidity of the volume regula - tion in COS - 7 cells in hypotonic media . It initiates about 2 min after the onset of the passive swelling and is nearly complete by 30 min at room temperature . ( 2 ) To determine whether the volume regulation requires energy . It is likely to , for the regulation is abolished at 0 (cid:2) C . ( 3 ) To determine whether volume regulation also occurs in COS - 7 cells that are shrunken in hypertonic media . It does not . ( 4 ) To determine whether ignorance of the existence of this vol - ume regulation can lead to substantial error in cryobiologi - cal interpretation . It can . ( 5 ) To raise the question of how many other cell types exhibit cell volume regulation of sufﬁcient magnitude and kinetics to inﬂuence cryobiological analyses and outcomes .

The cell suspension was kept ( in the dark ) at 22 (cid:2) C for at least 30 min before mixing the cells with the test solutions . To create BvH plots , images of cells in ﬁve different tonicities were recorded after 5 – 10 min or after 30 – 35 min of equilibration time . Details about the experimental conditions can be found in our previous publication [ 16 ] . Brieﬂy , all test solutions were made from TBS or , for the 30 min BvH plot data , from phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , by dilution with HPLC grade water or by addition of sucrose to the test solution ( all compounds from Sigma Aldrich ) . For the kinetic experiments , the test solutions were prepared with a 20 % higher or lower osmolality than the desired ﬁnal concentra - tion to compensate for the subsequent dilution with ( a ) the cell suspension in isotonic TBS or PBS and ( b ) with a 10 l M solution of the live - dead dye calcein AM in isotonic TBS or PBS . The ﬁnal osmolalities were measured ( Vapro Osmometer 5520 , Wescor Inc . , Logan , UT ) and amounted ( in case of the kinetic experiments after the addition of the respective volumes of isotonic TBS or PBS , adjusting for the dilution with small volumes of cell suspen - sion and calcein AM ) to : 152 / 157 ± 2 , 227 / 242 ± 2 , 308 / 308 ± 1 , 602 / 602 ± 6 , and 1010 / 986 ± 3 mOsm / kg ( values are mean ± S . E . M . The ﬁrst value refers to the 30 min exposure experiments , the sec - ond to the 5 min experiments ) . The value of 308 is the milliosmol - ality of isotonic TBS . Imaging of cells and estimations of cell volumes To obtain data for the BvH plots , the cell suspension was added at a 1 : 99 ratio to the four anisotonic test solutions and sufﬁcient volumes pipetted into the wells of a 24 well plate to ﬁll them . After a waiting time of P 30 min in the ﬁrst set , and 5 min in the second set of experiments , 251 ± 15 cells ( range : 170 – 314 ) were imaged with a Zeiss Axioscope microscope for each test solution over the ensuing 2 – 5 min , using both bright ﬁeld and ﬂuorescence micros - copy . Cell diameters were measured with NIH Image J 1 . 42Q soft - ware , averaged , and converted into volumes ( Microsoft Excel software ) assuming the cells to be spheres . However , the shapes of cells in 986 and 1011 mOsm / kg deviated too much from spher - ical to justify that assumption . Consequently , for them , we calcu - lated cell volumes using the formula for prolate spheroids . The initial determinations of cell volume as a function of osmo - lality were made on cells that had been exposed to the anisotonic solutions for 30 – 35 min at room temperature . These times were used to ensure that these large cells had attained osmotic equilib - rium . The results are shown in the BvH plot in Fig . 1 by the black circles and the dashed line . The Y - axis intercept at inﬁnite osmolal - ity is 1576 l m 3 , which translates to a volume of 0 . 47 relative to the mean measured volume of the isotonic cell ( 3324 l m 3 ) . Not only is this rather high , but we were especially suspicious about the fact that the mean volumes of the cells remained constant at reciprocal osmolalities of 3 . 3 , 4 . 5 , 6 . 7 or osmolalities of 0 . 308 , 0 . 227 , and 0 . 152 Osm / kg . Put differently , the volumes of cells in hypotonic solutions with concentrations that were 60 % and 50 % of isotonic were nearly the same as the volume of the cells in isotonic Tyrodes . One possible explanation for the lack of volume change in the hypotonic solutions was that active volume regulation was occur - ring over that 30 min interval . To test that possibility , we repeated the BvH measurements after exposing the cells for only 5 min to the anisotonic solutions . The results are shown by the black dia - monds and the solid line in Fig . 1 , and are dramatically different from the 30 min exposure data . The slope of the regression line is nearly twice as high for the 5 min line ( 614 vs . 354 ) , and the Y - axis intercept ( V b ) about half that of the 30 min line ( 993 l m 3 vs . 1576 l m 3 ) . For the 5 min data , the resulting fractional volume b ( relative to the mean measured volume of the isotonic cell ) is 0 . 30 , which is a factor of 1 . 6 lower than the value of b that results from the 30 min data plot . Kinetic measurements in hypotonic media To conﬁrm that volume regulation was occurring , we made ki - netic measurements of the volumes of the cells suspended in hypo - tonic TBS ( 0 . 157 Osm / kg ) for 50 min . The results are shown in Figs . 2 and 3 . Fig . 2 shows the bright ﬁeld microcopy images taken from the cells in hypotonic TBS at the peak of their initial volume increase at t = 2 min 46 s ( Fig . 2A ) and after completed RVD ( Fig . 2B ) at t = 56 min 46 s , showing a volume close to the isotonic volume . The computed difference image | image A (cid:2) image B | of Fig . 2C illustrates the diameter changes at the single cell level . Fig . 3 summarizes these results in the form of a plot of the aver - aged cell volume over time . The volumes were calculated from the averaged cell diameters . During the ﬁrst 2 min , the cells dis - played a passive volume increase that peaked at 180 % of their iso - tonic volume ( from 3324 ± 238 at isotonicity to 5941 ± 400 l m 3 ) . Subsequently , the cell volume started to decrease , reaching a value of 110 % of the isotonic volume ( 3534 ± 268 l m 3 ) after 30 min and ﬁnally dropping to as low as 95 % of isotonic ( 3123 ± 234 l m 3 ) after 50 min . The imaging for the data points represented by black diamonds in Fig . 1 was initiated after the cells had been exposed to the anisosmotic media for 5 min . Fig . 3 shows that the volume regula - tory decrease was already underway at that time in the 157 mil - liosmolal solution . This means that the maximum volume in that hypotonic medium ascribable to osmotic swelling was slightly higher than that depicted in Fig . 1 . From the relative cell volumes at 2 and 5 min , we estimate about 9 % higher . We assume it to be 3 % higher for cells in 242 mOsm solution , although measurements Fig . 1 . Two different Boyle - van’t Hoff plotsdisplaying the absolute volumeof COS - 7 cells as a function of the reciprocal of the osmolality of the anisotonic medium in which thecells weresuspended for 5 – 10 min ( black diamonds ) or 30 – 35 min ( black circles ) at 22 (cid:2) C . Each point is the mean value of 170 – 314 individually analyzed cells . Due to the effects of RVD , which occurred under hypotonic conditions and lowered the corresponding volumes to levels similar to the isotonic volume , the regression lineof the 30 mindata ( dotted line ) was muchﬂatterthan the5 mindata ( solid line ) , had a lower correlation coefﬁcient ( r 2 ) , and resulted in a 60 % higher value for V b . The volumes were calculated from the measured diameters as described in the text . Data were ﬁtted by the method of least squares . D . Peckys , P . Mazur / Cryobiology 65 ( 2012 ) 74 – 78 75 analogous to those for 157 mOsm were not made . These volume corrections have been applied in Fig . 4 to the two hypotonic data points in the set labeled ‘‘corrected’’ ( white squares ) . The effect of the correction on the resulting regression line ( dashed line ) is slight but discernable . This return of the cell volume in hypotonic media to the isotonic value was abolished at 0 (cid:2) C . At 0 (cid:2) C , cells with an initial isotonic volume of 3853 ± 270 l m 3 increased their volume by 184 % ( 7106 ± 509 l m 3 ) after about 10 min , but failed to initiate a subse - quent volume decrease ; i . e . , they remained in this enlarged state . ( The higher isotonic value at 0 (cid:2) C can be explained by inhibition of the Na + – K + - ATPase under hypothermic conditions [ 8 ] . ) The lack of regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) at 0 (cid:2) C is consistent with the fact that this cellular response is achieved by speciﬁc membrane proteins , many of which provide energetically driven channel func - tionality [ 14 , 5 , 15 , 12 ] . However , there could be a non - energetic contribution at 0 (cid:2) C from phase transitions in plasma membrane lipids [ 2 , 6 ] . Cell volumes were followed with video time - lapse microscopy . For room temperature measurements , suspensions of cells in iso - tonic TBS were mixed 1 : 4 with the hypotonic test solutions and immediately loaded into the 50 l m deep chamber of a MicroCell slide ( Conception Technologies , San Diego , CA ) . The slide was rap - idly transferred to the stage of a ﬂuorescence microscope where the imaging process was started after a brief searching and focus - ing period . Until its positioning onto the microscope stage , the MicroCell slides and the anisotonic test solutions were kept on ice to minimize the amount of cellular volume change that would occur before the ﬁrst microscope image could be obtained . The ﬁrst six images of an image series were recorded at 60 s intervals , start - ing 100 – 110 s after the mixing ; the interval time was then in - creased to 5 min for the following nine images . After the last Fig . 2 .

All other data points ( solid circles ) represent averages and S . E . M . values of 43 individually measured cells . Cells reached their maximum volume within 2 min , then reversed the swelling due to the onset of regulatory volume decrease mechanisms , and shrunk slowly back to a ﬁnal volume that was 95 % of their initial isotonic volume . Fig . 4 . Corrected and uncorrected BVH plots for COS - 7 cells after exposure to anisosmotic test solutions for 5 min . Fig . 2 showed that in the 157 mOsm hypotonic solution , the process of volume regulatory decrease ( RVD ) begins to reverse the passive osmotic swelling of the cells at about 2 min . Consequently in this , Fig . 3 , the measured cell volumes for the two points in the hypotonic range ( 242 and 157 mOsm / kg water ) have been multiplied by 1 . 03 and 1 . 09 , respectively to obtain the plotted corrected points ( white squares and dotted regression line ) . The uncorrected points ( black diamonds ) and ( solid ) regression line are the same as in Fig . 1 . 76 D . Peckys , P . Mazur / Cryobiology 65 ( 2012 ) 74 – 78 image , a ﬂuorescence image was taken to determine , and if neces - sary exclude , any dead cells from further analysis . To rule out any bias from the added calcein AM , we recorded control runs under exactly the same conditions , but without calcein AM . These time - lapse series were performed in 157 mOsm / kg TBS ( n = 43 ) . For the parallel series that were performed on cells in 157 mOsm / kg at 0 (cid:2) C ( n = 51 ) , we used a cryostage ( BCS 196 cryo - stage , Linkam Scientiﬁc Instruments , Waterﬁeld , UK ) . For these 0 (cid:2) C experiments , the 1 : 4 cell suspension - test TBS mixture was loaded into a chamber made from two 12 mm round glass cover slips , separated by a 40 l m thick circular plastic spacer and placed in a Linkam quartz dish . The dish in turn was placed a metal holder that ﬁtted into the cryostage . The test solutions , cover slips , and the metal holder were all kept at 2 – 4 (cid:2) C prior to insertion into the cryostage that had been precooled to 0 (cid:2) C . The microscope was not equipped for ﬂuorescence . Volume regulation of cells shrunken in hypertonic media Like most cells , COS - 7 cells undergo abrupt passive osmotic shrinkage when placed in hypertonic media . Thus , when placed in double - or even triple - strength hypertonic TBS ( 602 or 986 mOsm / kg ) , they shrink to 53 % and 44 % of their isotonic vol - ume , respectively . At this point , some cell types exhibit a regula - tory volume increase ( RVI ) that drives the cell volume back towards the isotonic value . However , that is not the case with COS - 7 . As opposed to the response in hypoosmotic media , the cells at 22 (cid:2) C remained shrunken and did not show any signs of a regu - latory volume increase over 60 min of observation . This difference in the regulatory response to swelling and shrinkage is not espe - cially surprising since the postulated mechanisms differ in the two cases . A similar unidirectional volume regulation has also been reported for other cell types such as pancreatic beta - cells [ 4 ] , renal cells [ 7 ] and an undifferentiated type of tumor cell [ 11 ] . One differ - ence is thought to be a consequence of the increased concentration of intracellular Cl (cid:2) resulting from cell shrinkage ; it hampers sev - eral ion transport mechanisms needed for RVI [ 9 ] . Also , in RVI , a central mechanism appears to be an energy - requiring increased uptake of NaCl coupled to the subsequent intracellular replace - ment of Na + by K + . In invertebrate cells , amino acids and other nonelectrolytes can also be involved [ 10 , 9 ] . In contrast , the mech - anisms responsible for RVD appear to require a mainly energy - driven extrusion of K + and Cl (cid:2) , as well as organic molecules such as amino acids , polyalcohols , and amines . Implications of volume regulation for Boyle van’t Hoff plots and estimates of non - osmotic water Returning to Fig . 1 , we see that unawareness of the operation of a volume regulatory response can introduce large errors in a Boyle van’t Hoff plot where measured cell volumes are assumed to be equilibrium cell volumes solely determined by passive osmotic ﬂows . This unawareness introduces nearly 2 - fold errors for COS - 7 cells in the slope of the line derived from a best linear ﬁt and its Y - axis intercept . A close inspection of Fig . 1 shows that all the discrepancies between the cell volumes after 5 and 30 min expo - sures to the test solution lie in the hypotonic region – not in the hypertonic region . This , of course , is in accord with our observation that volume regulation in COS - 7 cells occurs in the former but not in the latter . V b , the Y - axis intercept , is considered to be a measure of the sol - ids and bound water content of the cell . Usually , it is expressed as b , the ratio of V b to V iso cell . But we have expressed it and all other volumes as absolute volumes rather than volumes normalized to the isotonic cell volume . One reason for doing so is that there is ambiguity as to the proper value for V iso cell . We have taken it , as do most investigators , as the mean measured volume of the cell in isotonic media ; i . e . , 3324 l m 3 . On that basis , b for the uncor - rected 5 min line in Fig . 4 is 0 . 301 and 0 . 254 for in the corrected line . One could however take V iso cell to be the value calculated from the equation of the best ﬁt line at an osmolality of 0 . 308 or reciprocal osmolality of 3 . 25 . For the uncorrected line , that would be 2989 l m 3 , and b would be 993 / 2989 or 0 . 332 instead of 0 . 301 . The difference is small because here the measured volume of the isotonic cell is close to the value calculated from the best - ﬁt line . Katkov [ 13 ] has argued that the standard method of calculating b is wrong . He states that the correct regression line must pass through the measured cell volume in isotonic media . As a conse - quence , this regression line will be displaced from the regression line we have drawn but parallel to it . In the case of uncorrected 5 min data , we would have that . V b = V iso cell (cid:2) ( 614 ) ( 1 / M iso ) = ( 614 ) ( 3 . 25 ) = 1304 l m 3 , and b = 1304 / 3299 = 0 . 40 , a rather large difference from the values above . However , Benson [ 1 ] has recently reported that Katkov’s arguments can be rejected on mathematical grounds . Conse - quently , we do not accept his premise that the regression line must be forced to go through the point 1 / M iso , V iso cell ( measured ) . We close with the important ﬁfth question posed in the intro - duction ; namely , how many other cell types exhibit cell volume regulation of sufﬁcient magnitude and kinetics to inﬂuence cryo - biological analyses and outcomes ? We do not know . But we do know that volume regulation is common among cell types across a wide range of phyla [ 3 ] . This long - time conservation of a cellular process means that it is of high evolutionary importance to main - tain cells at close to their isotonic volume , which in turn means maintaining their cytosolic components at the optimum concen - trations . Chamberlin and Strange [ 3 ] point out that volume regula - tory mechanisms are crucial for cell survival . Thus , the maintenance or reestablishment of a constant intracellular milieu is required for the proper hydration state of cytosolic proteins and for the control of macromolecular crowding . Excessive altera - tions of cell volume endanger structural integrity and basic cellular physiology . Animal cells are therefore well equipped with a range of counteracting options they can activate [ 14 ] . We have cited a few examples . The existence of volume regulatory processes does not neces - sarily mean , however , that they have cryobiological signiﬁcance . They almost certainly do not act during the actual cooling and freezing of cells . Since they are enzymatically driven , the rates of these processes will likely slow by factors of two or three for every 10 (cid:2) C drop in temperature . Thus by (cid:2) 20 (cid:2) C , the rate will have dropped perhaps 100 - fold . In COS - 7 cells , we did not detect them at all at 0 (cid:2) C . But many important processes in cryobiology and cryopreserva - tion occur at room temperature , and as we have shown for COS - 7 cells , volume regulation could substantially and signiﬁcantly per - turb them . For example , prior to freezing , cells are usually equili - brated in hyperosmotic solutions of cryoprotective agents ( CPA ) such as glycerol or ethylene glycol . In that exposure , they undergo an abrupt decrease in volume followed by a much slower return to near normal volume . This is assumed to be totally a consequence of passive osmotic ﬂows , but volume regulation could also be operat - ing , and affecting subsequent analyses . Two cryobiologically important parameters derived from such shrink / swell curves are the permeability of a cell to water and to cryoprotective solutes . The estimation of these two parameters also assumes that cell vol - umes are being determined solely by passive ﬂows of solvent and solute . If such is not the case , the calculated permeability coefﬁ - cients could be signiﬁcantly in error . The ﬁndings in this paper on COS - 7 cells thus constitute a warning ﬂag to be sensitive to potential contributions from volume D . Peckys , P . Mazur / Cryobiology 65 ( 2012 ) 74 – 78 77 regulation . Based on our data , any such contribution should be simple to detect : A cell volume anomaly will be present at room temperature but not at 0 (cid:2) C and the extent of the anomaly will increase with time at room temperature or above .
