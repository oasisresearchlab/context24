JNK phosphorylation downstream of AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) activation is required for high CO 2 ( hypercapnia ) - induced Na , K - ATPase endocytosis in alveolar epithelial cells . Here , we provide evidence that during hypercapnia , JNK promotes the phosphorylation of LMO7b , a scaffolding protein , in vitro and in intact cells . LMO7b phosphorylation was blocked by exposing the cells to the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and by infecting cells with domi - nant - negative JNK or AMPK adenovirus . The knockdown of the endogenous LMO7b or overexpression of mutated LMO7b with alanine substitutions of ﬁve potential JNK phosphorylation sites ( LMO7b - 5SA ) or only Ser - 1295 rescued both LMO7b phos - phorylation and the hypercapnia - induced Na , K - ATPase endocytosis . Moreover , high CO 2 promoted the colocalization and in - teraction of LMO7b and the Na , K - ATPase (cid:3) 1 subunit at the plasma membrane , which were prevented by SP600125 or by trans - fecting cells with LMO7b - 5SA . Collectively , our data suggest that hypercapnia leads to JNK - induced LMO7b phosphorylation at Ser - 1295 , which facilitates the interaction of LMO7b with Na , K - ATPase at the plasma membrane promoting the endocytosis of Na , K - ATPase in alveolar epithelial cells . P atients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can develop elevated levels of CO 2 in blood and tissue ( hypercapnia ) , which is associated with worse outcomes ( 1 – 4 ) . Recent studies demonstrated that high CO 2 levels impair alveolar edema clearance , an important func - tion of the alveolar epithelium ( 3 , 5 – 7 ) . The clearance of alveolar edema is effected by active Na (cid:2) transport via the apical Na (cid:2) chan - nels and the basolateral Na , K - ATPase ( 8 – 12 ) . Na , K - ATPase is a transmembrane protein comprised of a cat - alytic (cid:3) subunit and a structural (cid:4) subunit ( 13 ) and is localized on the basolateral surface of mammalian epithelial cells . Endocytosis has been shown to reduce Na , K - ATPase for both enzymatic activ - ity and lung edema clearance ( 7 , 10 , 14 – 16 ) . We have previously reported that hypercapnia leads to the endocytosis of Na , K - ATPase via a mechanism that involves the activation of 5 = AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and protein kinase C (cid:5) ( PKC (cid:5) ) ( 5 , 7 , 17 ) . More recently , we demonstrated that c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) is activated during hypercapnia and leads to the endocytosis of the Na , K - ATPase ( 6 ) . However , the mechanisms by which JNK promotes Na , K - ATPase endocytosis still are un - clear . JNK is a serine / threonine protein kinase , belonging to a group of mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) , which , upon activation by extracellular stimuli , regulates cellular re - sponses leading to cell adaptation , survival , or apoptosis ( 18 ) . The majority of the substrates for JNK are transcription factors and antiapoptotic proteins ( 19 , 20 ) . However , JNK also participates in actin reorganization and remodeling ( 21 , 22 ) and has been impli - cated in the regulation of cell - cell adhesion by phosphorylating (cid:4) - catenin , triggering its endocytosis ( 23 , 24 ) . An important fea - ture of the MAPK signaling pathways is the formation of signaling complexes that contain not only active kinases but also scaffold proteins that lack enzymatic activity . It has been proposed that the phosphorylation of scaffolding proteins regulates interactions with their binding partners ( 19 , 25 ) . To assess potential targets of JNK regulating Na , K - ATPase endocytosis during hypercapnia , we performed a screen with an antibody that recognizes proteins phosphorylated in a MAPK consensus sequence ( a phosphory - lated serine or threonine residue followed by a proline residue [ 26 ] ) andidentiﬁedLIMdomain - only7b ( LMO7b ) , aproteinthat has been described to regulate the actin cytoskeleton in epithelial cells ( 27 , 28 ) . LMO7b contains PDZ and LIM domains that are involved in protein - protein interactions and the calponin homol - ogy domain , which binds actin ( 27 ) . Here , we report that hyper - capnia induces the phosphorylation of LMO7b downstream of JNK , which facilitates the interaction of LMO7 with Na , K - ATPase at the plasma membrane and leads to Na , K - ATPase endocytosis in alveolar epithelial cells .

Takai ( Kobe University Grad - uate School of Medicine , Kobe , Japan ) . The initial mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis and the determination of phospho sites in LMO7b were performed at the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . Alveolar epithelial cell isolation and culture . Animals were provided with food and water ad libitum , maintained on a 14 - h : 10 - h light - dark cycle , and handled according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee - approved experimental protocol . Alveolar epithelial type II ( rATII ) cells were isolated from the lungs of Sprague - Dawley rats ( 200 to 225 g ) by elastase digestion , as previously described ( 29 ) . The day of iso - lation and plating was designated culture day 0 . All experiments were conducted on day 2 or 3 . Human A549 cells ( ATCC CCL 185 ; Manassas , VA ) or A549 cells stably expressing the rat Na , K - ATPase - (cid:3) 1 subunit tagged with GFP ( A549 - GFP - (cid:3) 1 ) were previously described ( 10 ) . A549 - GFP - (cid:3) 1 cells show the same enzymatic activity and respond to stimuli similarly to wild - type ( WT ) A549 cells ( 30 ) . Cells were grown in Dulbec - co’s modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bo - vine serum ( FBS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 (cid:7) g / ml streptomycin . For A549 - GFP - (cid:3) 1 , 3 (cid:7) M ouabain was added to suppress the endogenous Na , K - ATPase - (cid:3) 1 subunit . Cells were incubated in a humidiﬁed atmo - sphere of 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air at 37°C . CO 2 media and CO 2 exposure . For the different experimental condi - tions , initial solutions were prepared with DMEM – Ham’s F - 12 medium - Tris base ( 3 : 1 : 0 . 5 ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum with 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 (cid:7) g / ml streptomycin . The buffering capacity of the me - dia was modiﬁed by changing its initial pH with Tris base in order to obtain pH 7 . 4 at the various CO 2 levels ( partial CO 2 pressure [ pCO 2 ] of 40 , 60 , 80 , and 120 mm Hg ) ( 4 ) . The desired CO 2 and pH levels were achieved by equilibrating the media overnight in a humidiﬁed chamber ( C - chamber ; BioSpherix Ltd . , Lacona , NY ) . The C - chamber’s atmo - sphere was controlled with a PRO - CO 2 carbon dioxide controller ( Bio - spherix ) . In this chamber , cells were exposed to the desired pCO 2 while maintaining 21 % O 2 balanced with N 2 . Prior to and after CO 2 exposure , pH , pCO 2 , and pO 2 levels in the media were measured using a Stat Proﬁle pHOx blood gas analyzer ( Nova Biomedical , Waltham , MA ) . Experi - ments were started by replacing culture media with the CO 2 - equilibrated media and incubating in the C - chamber for the desired time . Normoxic conditions were consistent over the course of all experiments . GenerationofLMO7bmutants . ThedifferentratFLAG - LMO7bmu - tants were created by replacing the serine residues in the indicated positions with alanine residues using the QuikChange XL site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) by following the manufac - turer’s protocols for primer design and reaction conditions .

Incubation with speciﬁc antibodies was performed overnight at 4°C . When more than one primary antibody was used on the same membrane , blots were stripped by incubating fo r 1 h at 55°C in stripping solution ( 62 . 5 mM Tris - HCl , 2 % SDS , 100 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , pH 6 . 8 ) .

We have previously reported that exposing rATII or A549 cells to elevated CO 2 levels resulted in a concentration - dependent decrease in the Na , K - ATPase - (cid:3) 1 subunit protein abundance at the plasma membrane ( 5 ) . High CO 2 also led to time - and concentration - dependent JNK activation , which was required for hypercapnia - induced Na , K - ATPase endocytosis ( 6 ) . While it has been described that Na , K - ATPase - (cid:3) 1 is phosphory - lated by ERK1 / 2 ( 36 , 37 ) , our previous report suggested that JNK does not directly phosphorylate the Na , K - ATPase - (cid:3) 1 subunit ( 6 ) . To identify a target of JNK phosphorylation during hypercapnia in the alveolar epithelium , rATII cells were exposed to high CO 2 for 10 min and analyzed for the presence of phosphorylated pro - teins by Western blotting using a pT / S - P antibody ( 26 ) . Among several bands , the one at (cid:9) 150 kDa was observed only in the absence of the competitive inhibitor of JNK phosphorylation , SP600125 . Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the observed Dada et al . 3964 mcb . asm . org December 2015 Volume 35 Number 23 Molecular and Cellular Biology on D e c e m be r 17 , 2015 b y UN I V O F C A L I F SA N D I E GO h tt p : / / m c b . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m phosphorylatedbandcorrespondstotheratLMO7b ( Fig . 1A ) . Rat LMO7 is expressed as two splice variants , LMO7a ( 196 kDa ) and LMO7b ( 157 kDa ) ( 27 ) ; however , rATII cells only express LMO7b ( Fig . 1B ) , which is consistent with a previous report on adult mouse lung ( 28 ) . Also , in agreement with the previous report in rodent lungs , the polyclonal antibody used recognized faster - mi - grating bands ( 28 ) . Little is known about the regulation of LMO7b function , and no phosphorylation sites have been described . To study LMO7b phosphorylation , rATII cells were exposed to high CO 2 , and the phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated LMO7b was assessed by Western blotting with pT / S - P . Hypercapnia in - creased LMO7b phosphorylation in a concentration - dependent mode ( Fig . 1C ) . At 120 mm Hg of CO 2 , maximal phosphorylation was achieved after 10 min of exposure ( Fig . 1D ) . All subsequent experiments to study LMO7b phosphorylation were carried out at 120 mm Hg of CO 2 for 10 min unless otherwise stated . In A549 cells transfected with rat FLAG - LMO7b , high CO 2 increased LMO7b phosphorylation , as assessed by Western blotting using pT / S - P or phospho - MAPK substrate antibodies ( Fig . 1E ) . To determine whether LMO7 was phosphorylated via a JNK - dependent pathway , rATII cells were pretreated with SP600125 or infected with Ad - DN - JNK ( 6 ) . Both treatments inhibited the CO 2 - increased LMO7b phosphorylation compared to that with a vehicle or Ad - null infection ( Fig . 2A and B ) . We have previously reported that during hypercapnia , AMPK - dependent phosphory - lation was required for both JNK activation and Na , K - ATPase endocytosis ( 6 , 7 ) . Inagreementwiththoseresults , theinfectionof rATII cells with Ad - DN - AMPK also prevented LMO7b phos - phorylation induced by CO 2 ( Fig . 2C ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the CO 2 - induced LMO7b phosphorylation in a T / S - P domain is dependent on JNK activity . JNK phosphorylates LMO7 in vitro . Subsequently , we inves - tigated whether JNK phosphorylates LMO7b . We performed an in vitro kinase assay using LMO7b , which was immunoprecipitated from rATII cells , as a substrate and a commercially available re - combinant active JNK1 . Under these conditions , JNK phosphor - ylated LMO7b ( Fig . 3A ) . Interestingly , we observed some phos - phorylation of LMO7b even in the absence of the kinase , and a similar result was obtained when we used FLAG - LMO7b as a sub - strate , suggesting that other kinases are present ( Fig . 3B ) . The presence of SP600125 in the assay prevented the increase in LMO7b phosphorylation induced by JNK ( Fig . 3C ) , and the phos - FIG 1 LMO7b is phosphorylated during hypercapnia in T / S - P domain . ( A ) rATII cells were exposed to 120 mm Hg CO 2 for 10 min in the presence or absence of the inhibitor of JNK phosphorylation , SP600125 , and analyzed by Western blotting ( WB ) using a pT / S - P antibody .

These results indicate that LMO7b is an in vitro substrate for JNK , although we cannot exclude the presence of another kinase that was coimmunoprecipitated with LMO7b and activated by JNK during the kinase assay . We next sought to determine the residues of LMO7b that are phosphorylated by JNK . For this purpose , we used mass spec - trometry to map serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in LMO7b samples from cells exposed to 40 or 120 mm Hg CO 2 and found seven peptides which were assigned as phosphorylation sites . However , none were differentially phosphorylated during hypercapnia compared to that during normocapnia , which is con - sistent with the data in Fig . 1 and 2 showing that LMO7b has a basal level of phosphorylation . Out of the phosphorylated pep - tides , we choose those in which the phosphorylated Ser / Thr was followed by a Pro and identiﬁed the presence of ﬁve potential JNK phosphorylation sites : Ser - 727 , Ser - 1295 , Ser - 1298 , Ser - 1300 , and Ser - 1305 ( Fig . 3D ) . Interestingly , using Scansite3 and Kinephos 2 . 0 , we found that Ser - 727 , Ser - 1295 , Ser - 1298 , Ser - 1300 , and Ser - 1305 are predicted phosphorylation sites of the CMCG kinases , of which the MAPK family is a subgroup ( 19 ) . We mutated the ﬁve potential JNK phosphorylation sites in FLAG - LMO7b to alanine ( FLAG - LMO7b - 5SA ) by site - directed mutagenesis . The in vitro kinase assay showed that FLAG - LMO7b - 5SA was not phosphor - ylated by the active JNK1 , in contrast to FLAG - LMO7b - WT ( Fig . 3E ) . We next analyzed whether LMO7b also was phosphorylated in those sites in intact cells . A549 cells were transfected with FLAG - LMO7b - WT or FLAG - LMO7b - 5SA and exposed to high CO 2 . The replacement of the ﬁve serine residues by alanine resi - dues resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in phosphorylation com - pared to the level with WT LMO7b ( Fig . 3F ) . Collectively , these results indicate that during hypercapnia LMO7b is phosphory - lated both in vitro and in vivo downstream of JNK activation . JNK - dependentLMO7bphosphorylationisrequiredforhyper - capnia - mediated Na , K - ATPase endocytosis . To study whether LMO7b plays a role in hypercapnia - induced Na , K - ATPase endocy - tosis , we silenced LMO7b . This treatment prevented the hypercap - nia - induced decrease of the (cid:3) 1 subunit in the plasma membrane in A549 cells ( Fig . 4A ) . We next studied the functional consequences of CO 2 - induced LMO7b phosphorylation on the endocytosis of the Na , K - ATPase . We generated several mutants where the potential JNK phosphorylation sites in LMO7b were replaced by alanine residues individually or in combination . Besides the LMO7b - 5SA construct , we generated FLAG - LMO7b - 4SA ( S727A , S1295A , S1300A , S1305A ) , FLAG - LMO7b - 3SA ( S727A , S1295A , S1305A ) , FLAG - LMO7b - S727A , S1305A , FLAG - LMO7b - S727A , S1295A , FLAG - LMO7b - S727A , and FLAG - LMO7b - S1295A ( Fig . 4B ) . The expression of FLAG - LMO7b - 5SA , FLAG - LMO7b - 4SA , or FLAG - LMO7b - 3SA prevented hypercapnia - induced Na , K - ATPase en - docytosis , excluding a role for S1300 and S1298 as phosphoryla - tion targets of JNK - induced phosphorylation ( Fig . 4C ) . Interestingly , the expression of FLAG - LMO7b - S727A , S1305A did not prevent endocytosis , but no endocytosis was observed when the cells were transfected with LMO7b - S727A , S1295A ( Fig . 5A ) . When we further analyzed the effect of individually mutated Ser - 727 and Ser - 1295 , we found that only the replacement of Ser - 1295 prevented the high CO 2 - induced Na , K - ATPase endocytosis ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , FLAG - LMO7b - S1295A is less phosphorylated in the in vitro kinase assay ( Fig . 5B , left ) , while FLAG - LMO7b - S727A , FLAG - LMO7b - S1300A , and FLAG - LMO7b - S1305A are phosphorylated to approximately the same extent as FLAG - LMO7b - WT ( Fig . 5B , middle ) , suggesting that the phosphoryla - tion of LMO7b at Ser - 1295 is required for Na , K - ATPase endocy - tosis during hypercapnia . JNK - induced phosphorylation of LMO7b is required for its interaction with Na , K - ATPase during hypercapnia . Microscopy analysis of endogenous LMO7b shows a plasma membrane and cytoplasmic distribution ( Fig . 6A ) . In untreated rATII cells , LMO7b ( red ) localized mostly at the apical side and Na , K - ATPase ( green ) at the lateral side of the cells , and minimal colocalization was observed , as demonstrated in the vertical sections of the cell generated from confocal z - stack images ( Fig . 6A ) . In the presence of high CO 2 , there was a redistribution of LMO7b from the apical to the lateral domains , where its colocalization with Na , K - ATPase was increased ( Fig . 6A [ arrows ] , B , [ CO 2 ] , and C ) compared to the control cells ( Fig . 6A [ arrowheads ] , B , [ CT ] , and C ) . Figure 6B shows that exposure to high CO 2 increases the plasma membrane colocalization between Na , K - ATPase and LMO7b . Importantly , the inhibition of JNK prevented a hypercapnia - induced increase in colocalization between Na , K - ATPase and LMO7b . Taken to - gether , these results suggest that high CO 2 induces JNK - depen - dent LMO7b phosphorylation , which triggers the redistribution of LMO7b to the lateral membrane , where it colocalizes and pre - sumably interacts with Na , K - ATPase . We conﬁrmed the interaction between Na , K - ATPase and LMO7b during hypercapnia in A549 - GFP - (cid:3) 1 cells transiently transfected with rat FLAG - LMO7b .

The interaction between Na , K - ATPase and LMO7b was pre - vented in cells pretreated with SP600125 and , importantly , in cells transfected with LMO7b - S1295A ( Fig . 7 ) , supporting the func - tional role of LMO7b phosphorylation and in agreement with the immunoﬂuorescence data . Hypercapnia increases the interaction of LMO7b with pro - teins of the endocytic pathway . It has been described that in epi - thelial lung and kidney cells , Na , K - ATPase endocytosis during hypoxia or dopamine stimulation is clathrin dependent ( 30 , 38 ) . Interestingly , we observed that hypercapnia increases the interac - tion of Na , K - ATPase with the clathrin heavy chain ( Fig . 8A ) . To explore the mechanism by which LMO7b plays a role in Na , K - ATPase endocytosis during hypercapnia , we assessed the proteins coimmunoprecipitated with LMO7b in rATII cells ex - posed to high CO 2 . Besides the Na , K - ATPase (cid:3) subunit , the anal - ysis identiﬁed several proteins whose interactions with LMO7b were increased during hypercapnia ( Fig . 8B , LMO7b bound CO 2 / CT ) without changing their total levels . The list of proteins whose binding to LMO7b increased during hypercapnia includes pro - teins that are required for clathrin - dependent endocytosis and vesicular trafﬁcking . In particular , the interaction between LMO7b and adaptor binding protein complex 2 - beta subunit ( AP2 - (cid:4) ) is increased by hypercapnia . AP2 - (cid:4) mediates the forma - tion of endocytic clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma mem - brane by binding to clathrin ( 39 – 41 ) . Other hypercapnia - induced LMO7b - interacting proteins include proteins that are involved in vesicular trafﬁcking and / or membrane fusion , like cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain 1 ( 42 ) , Rab GTPase - binding effector protein 1 ( 43 ) , coﬁlin 1 ( 44 – 46 ) , septins ( 47 , 48 ) , and Huntingtin - inter - acting protein 1 related ( Hip1R ) ( 49 ) . Ezrin is involved in , among other functions , cytoskeletal anchoring at the plasma membrane ( 50 ) . Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12 was another protein that was identiﬁed which has been described to bind 14 - 3 - 3 protein and act as a signal transductor during endocytosis ( 51 ) . As such , our results suggest that the phosphorylation of LMO7b downstream JNK activation during hypercapnia pro - motes the interaction and / or binding with multiple members of the clathrin - dependent endocytic pathway as well as with Na , K - ATPase , facilitating the endocytic process . DISCUSSION Hypercapnia impairs alveolar epithelial function by promoting Na , K - ATPase endocytosis in vivo and in vitro via the phosphory - lation and activation of JNK downstream of AMPK and PKC (cid:5) ( 5 – 7 ) . Here , we show that during hypercapnia , JNK activation promotes the phosphorylation of LMO7b , followed by its colocal - ization and interaction with the Na , K - ATPase and several compo - nents of the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery . In vitro ki - nase assays and studies in cultured cells suggest that JNK phosphorylates LMO7b at Ser - 1295 .

These ﬁndings contribute to our understanding of the regulation of Na , K - ATPase expression attheplasmamembraneofepithelialcellsduringhypercapniaandtotheregulationofNa (cid:2) transport , which is essential for the opti - mal function of the alveolar epithelium . We have reported that Na , K - ATPase endocytosis during hy - percapnia requires the activation of JNK ; however , JNK does not phosphorylate the Na , K - ATPase ( 6 ) . Our current study suggested that LMO7b is a substrate for JNK in alveolar epithelial cells ex - posed to elevated CO 2 . LMO7 , an actin - binding protein widely expressed in adult tissues and particularly in lung epithelial cells ( 27 , 28 ) , belongs to a family of nine proteins that contain both PDZ and LIM domains . These domains function as protein - pro - tein recognition modules and play a role in the maintenance of epithelial cell architecture ( 28 ) . The expression of LMO7 is cell type speciﬁc , and in agreement with previous publications ( 52 ) , we found that rat alveolar type II cells express only LMO7b . These results agree with previous reports that LMO7a ( 220 kDa ) is ex - pressed only in embryonic stem cells ( 28 ) . It has been described that in normal bronchial epithelium LMO7 usually is localized to the apical membranes , while normal alveolar cells display circum - ferential staining of the entire cell membrane ( 52 ) . MAPKs usually phosphorylate a serine or threonine followed by a proline , and LMO7b has ﬁve such sequences ( Fig . 4B ) . We determined that high CO 2 exposure results in the phosphorylation of LMO7b in a time - and concentration - dependent manner . Furthermore , this phosphorylation was prevented by pharmacologically or geneti - cally inhibiting JNK or by overexpressing a dominant - negative form of AMPK , which acts upstream of JNK . An in vitro kinase assay suggested that JNK induces LMO7b phosphorylation and that when the ﬁve serines in the Ser - Pro domains ( Ser - 727 , Ser - 1295 , Ser - 1298 , Ser - 1300 , and Ser - 1305 ) were mutated to alanine , the phosphorylation was prevented . In the absence of JNK , a low level of phosphorylation still was observed ; this could be the result of LMO7b phosphorylation by another kinase that coprecipitates with LMO7b and that is not inhibited by SP600125 , suggesting that LMO7b also is the substrate of other kinases . Importantly , FLAG - LMO7b - 5SA failed to be phosphorylated in vivo in re - sponse to CO 2 ( Fig . 3F ) . Interestingly , LMO7b exhibits the amino acid sequence 1030 K LQER L M L 1037 , which follows the JNK bind - ing domain ( JBD ) consensus sequence , which generally has the pattern R / K 2 – 3 - X 1 – 6 - L / I - X - L / I , similar to the one present in c - jun ( 33 I - L - K - Q - S - M - T - L - N - L - A 43 ) , a bona ﬁde JNK substrate , and it is considered a JNK binding domain ( 53 ) . The presence of a JBD usually enhances the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of phosphorylation and / or mediates the interaction with upstream activators , sub - strates , or scaffolding molecules ( 19 , 54 ) . The inhibition of JNK prevents Na , K - ATPase endocytosis dur - ing hypercapnia ( 6 ) , and silencing of LMO7b or overexpressing FLAG - LMO7b - 5SA in alveolar epithelial cells inhibited the hyper - capnia - induced Na , K - ATPase endocytosis , suggesting a physio - logical role for the phosphorylation of LMO7b during hypercap - nia . Moreover , using an in vitro kinase assay and cell surface biotinylation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments , we iden - tiﬁed Ser - 1295 as a new phosphorylation site which is required for high CO 2 - dependent Na , K - ATPase endocytosis .

Ser - 1295 is adjacent to the LIM domain ( amino acids 1326 to 1384 ) and is part of the C - terminal proline - rich domain ( TSPGSPSPR ) . Interestingly , it has been described that JNK phosphorylates a very similar proline - rich domain ( TPGTPGTPS ) located in the C terminus of microtubule - associ - ated protein 2 in dendritic cells ( 55 ) . One possible mechanism is that Ser - 1295 phosphorylation in response to high CO 2 alters the conformational proﬁle of the adjacent LIM domain and / or other regions of the molecule , promoting the formation of a complex containing Na , K - ATPase , JNK , and possibly other molecules . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that , in the untreated / unphosphorylated state , LMO7b is located mostly at the apical membrane of the alveolar epithelial cells , where it does not inter - act with Na , K - ATPase , while the phosphorylation of Ser - 1295 re - sults in a relocalization to the lateral membrane ( Fig . 6A ) . JNK - mediated phosphorylation may change the activity of its substrates ; however , in some cases , it has been described that the phosphorylation - dependent changes are more complex and in - volve changes in protein binding and / or localization in the cell ( 19 ) . Our coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate a phys - ical interaction between Na , K - ATPase and LMO7b even under normocapnic conditions , which is increased after exposure to hypercapnia . This interaction is dependent both on JNK activ - ity and on the phosphorylation of LMO7b at Ser - 1295 ( Fig . 6 and 7 ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that the phys - ical interaction of LMO7b and Na , K - ATPase under hypercap - nic conditions is dependent on LMO7b Ser - 1295 phosphory - lation by JNK . We have previously described that in response to a variety of signals , Na , K - ATPase endocytosis occurs via a clathrin - depen - dent mechanism and interacts with AP2 ( 30 , 38 , 56 ) . In agree - ment with these results , the exposure of the cells to hypercapnia results in the increased interaction of the Na , K - ATPase - (cid:3) 1 sub - unit not only with FLAG - LMO7b but also with clathrin heavy chain ( Fig . 8A ) , suggesting that LMO7b contributes to the for - mation of the endocytic vesicles .

One of the proteins whose interaction with LMO7b is increased during hypercapnia is the AP2 - (cid:4) subunit , which links clathrin to the cargo protein ( 39 , 40 ) . Other proteins identiﬁed play different roles during endocytosis . Collectively , our results suggest that LMO7b phosphorylation serves as a signal to pro - mote the organization of the forming vesicle or for the recruit - ment of proteins to the vesicle . LMO7b is a multidomain pro - tein which binds to actin and also possesses LIM and PDZ domains , which are involved in interactions with other pro - teins ( 27 ) . LMO7b may act as a scaffolding protein by bringing together the actin cytoskeleton with the endocytic machinery and Na , K - ATPase , facilitating the endocytic ﬂow . In summary , we provide evidence that LMO7b is important in hypercapnia - induced Na , K - ATPase endocytosis .
