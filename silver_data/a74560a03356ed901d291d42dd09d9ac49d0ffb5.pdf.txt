Among the newly discovered viruses , Merkel Cell Polyomavirus ( MCPyV or MCV ) has gained the most attention due to its link with a rare human cancer . Infection with MCPyV is common in the human population , and the virus is detected in several anatomical locations , but most frequently in skin . Study of MCPyV molecular virology has been complicated by the lack of straightforward cell culture models , but recent in vitro studies are making strides towards understanding the virus life cycle , its cellular tropism , and mode of transmission . While MCPyV shares several traditional traits with other human polyomaviruses , the burst of research since its discovery reveals insight into a virus with many unique genetic and mechanistic features . The evidence for a causal link between MCPyV and the rare neuroendocrine cancer , Merkel Cell Carcinoma ( MCC ) , is compelling . A majority of MCCs contain clonally integrated viral DNA , express viral T antigen transcripts and protein , and exhibit an addiction to the viral large T and small t antigen oncoproteins . The MCPyV large T antigen contains MCC tumor - speciﬁc mutations that ablate its replication capacity but preserve its oncogenic functions , and the small t antigen promotes an environment favorable for cap - dependent translation . The mechanisms of MCPyV - induced transformation have not been fully elucidated , but the likely etiological role of this new polyomavirus in human cancer provides a strong opportunity to expand knowledge of virus – host interactions and viral oncology . & 2012 Elsevier B .

There are currently three genera and twenty - two different species of polyomaviruses , all of which are non - enveloped , icosahedral viruses that contain a circular , double - stranded DNA genome of approximately 5000 base pairs ( Johne et al . , 2011 ) . The trans - forming potential of these viruses has long been appreciated since isolation of the ﬁrst polyomavirus by Ludwik Gross in 1953 . Gross demonstrated that a transmissible agent , the now - archetypal murine polyomavirus ( MPyV ) , induced tumors in mice ( Gross , 1953 , 1954 ) . The ﬁeld of polyomavirus virology expanded in 1960 with the discovery of simian vacuolating virus 40 ( SV40 ) in monkey kidney cell cultures used for production of human poliovirus vaccines ( Sweet and Hilleman , 1960 ) . Subsequent studies reporting the oncogenic potential of SV40 ( Eddy et al . , 1961 , 1962 ; Rabson and Kirschstein , 1962 ; Shein and Enders , 1962 ) thrust this virus into the sphere of human health and sparked concern over the admin - istration of a vaccine with an oncogenic contaminant to a large percentage of the human population . Over the next several decades , intense research efforts attempted to establish a causal relationship between SV40 and human cancers , but to date no deﬁnitive link has been made ( Reviewed in Poulin and DeCaprio , 2006 ) . Regardless , the seminal contributions to science that arose from these efforts DAPI DAPI CK20 ( AF488 ) NSE ( AF488 ) CK8 ( AF647 ) CK8 ( AF647 ) Merged Merged Fig . 1 .

Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 119 and from the study of polyomaviruses in general cannot be understated , and include discoveries of p53 ( Lane and Crawford , 1979 ; Linzer and Levine , 1979 ) , the ﬁrst nuclear localization signal ( Lanford and Butel , 1984 ) , tyrosine phosphorylation ( Eckhart et al . , 1979 ) and PI3K signaling ( Whitman et al . , 1985 ) , and basic mechanisms in the process of DNA replication ( Li and Kelly , 1984 ; Waga and Stillman , 1994 ) . The detection of polyomaviruses that infect humans has rapidly escalated in the last decade . There are currently eleven identiﬁed human polyomaviruses , nine of which have been discovered in the last ﬁve years ( Reviewed in Buck et al . , 2012 ; Chang and Moore , 2012 ; Siebrasse et al . , 2012 ) . Nearly half of these human polyomaviruses are linked to human diseases , although many of these associations remain tenuous . To date , Merkel Cell Polyoma - virus ( MCPyV ; also referred to as MCV ) is the only human polyomavirus with a robust collection of scientiﬁc evidence sup - porting its classiﬁcation as a causative agent of a human malig - nancy , Merkel Cell Carcinoma ( MCC ) . Merkel cells and Merkel cell carcinoma First described as ‘touch cells’ by Friedrich Sigmund Merkel in 1875 , Merkel cells are found in hair follicles , certain mucosal tissues , and are most abundant in areas of the skin involved in the sensation of touch ( Fig . 1A ) . In vertebrate skin , Merkel cells are located in the basal layer of the epidermis , and it is here where the structure and function of these cells are best characterized . At their position adjacent to the dermis , Merkel cells are bound to the terminal ends of sensory nerve ﬁbers . These nerve - associated Merkel cells serve as mechanoreceptors that transduce mechanical stimuli from the skin . Morphological and ultrastructural character - istics of Merkel cells include a round or oval shape , electron - dense core secretory granules surrounded by a clear ‘halo’ , and spinous projections on their surface . A panel of immunohistochemical markers is used to detect and distinguish Merkel cells , and typically includes cytokeratins 8 , 18 , 19 , and 20 and the neuroen - docrine markers chromogranin A , synaptophisin , and neuron - speciﬁc enolase ( Fig . 1B ) . Of these markers , cytokeratin 20 is considered the most sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic marker of Merkel cells . ( Reviewed in Gould et al . , 1985 ; Halata et al . , 2003 ; Lucarz and Brand , 2007 ; Moll et al . , 2005 ; Sidhu et al . , 2005 ) . Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) is a malignancy of cutaneous neuroendocrine cells , and is therefore generally believed to origi - nate from the transformation of Merkel cells ( Gould et al . , 1985 ) . It was ﬁrst described by Toker in 1972 ( Toker , 1972 ) , yet the pathogenesis and etiology of MCC remains complex and poorly understood . Approximately 1500 new cases of MCC are diagnosed per year in the US , representing a relatively rare cancer ; however , the incidence of MCC has tripled in the last two decades and annual diagnoses continue to climb by 5 – 10 % ( Agelli and Clegg , 2003 ; Becker et al . , 2009b ; Calder and Smoller , 2010 ; Hodgson , 2005 ; Lemos and Nghiem , 2007 ) . Moreover , despite the rarity of MCC , it is one of the most lethal and aggressive skin cancers with a mortality rate greater than 30 % ( Hodgson , 2005 ) . The most common clinical features of MCC are summarized by the acronym ‘‘AEIOU’’ ( Heath et al . , 2008 ) : Asymptomatic , Expand - ing rapidly , Immune suppression , Older than age 50 , and UV - exposed site on a fair - skinned individual . There is a striking increase in the incidence of MCC in HIV - infected individuals ( Engels et al . , 2002 ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients ( Vlad and Woodlock , 2003 ) , and following organ transplantation ( Buell et al . , 2002 ; Heath et al . , 2008 ; Penn and First , 1999 ) . MCC is primarily a disease of the elderly , with the mean age of onset for men and women being 74 and 76 years of age , respectively ( Agelli and Clegg , 2003 ) . In addition , MCC occurs almost exclusively in Caucasians at sites of the body that are frequently sun - exposed , and disease rates are correlated with equatorial proximity ( Agelli and Clegg , 2003 ; Albores - Saavedra et al . , 2010 ; Heath et al . , 2008 ; Miller and Rabkin , 1999 ) . Interestingly , Merkel cells are more concentrated in sun - exposed compared to non - exposed skin ( Moll et al . , 1990 ) and UV - speciﬁc mutations have been observed in the p53 gene of MCCs ( Popp et al . , 2002 ) . Taken together , these statistics suggest that a combination of immunosuppression and the potential oncogenic pathways elicited by UV exposure are involved in MCC pathogenesis , yet these factors alone do not fully account for the etiology of MCC . Discovery of Merkel cell polyomavirus Based mainly on the aforementioned link between MCC and immune suppression , the research team led by Patrick Moore and Yuan Chang at the University of Pittsburgh sought to determine whether MCC has an infectious origin . This group , in particular , was well - suited for the search given their previous discovery of Kaposi’s sarcoma - associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) in AIDS - associated Kaposi’s sarcoma tissue using a technique known as representational difference analysis ( RDA ) ( Chang et al . , 1994 ) . RDA uses PCR ampliﬁcation of restriction fragments to create ‘representations’ of the DNA genome of normal or diseased tissue . After ligating the diseased tissue representation with priming sequences , it is mixed with unligated representation DNA from normal tissue . Following multiple rounds of PCR ampliﬁcation in a subtractive hybridization process , those sequences that fail to hybridize with normal tissue counterparts become doubly primed and thus enriched during PCR . While the RDA technique was used to successfully identify KSHV , it relies heavily on the presence of non - diseased tissue controls and is rather non - quantitative . To begin the search for viral sequences in MCC , the Chang – Moore research group built on the principles of RDA and moder - nized the technique by combining it with the availability of sequences from the entire human genome . The product was a related but distinct method known as digital transcriptome sub - straction ( DTS ) ( Feng et al . , 2007 ) . DTS uses a combination of high - throughput cDNA sequencing and in silico methods to sequentially exclude human sequences from a tissue sample transcriptome . For each normal or diseased sample , cDNA libraries are created and then subjected to sequencing , and the results compared to human sequence databases . In 2008 , the DTS technique was applied to four MCC tumors and revealed previously unidentiﬁed viral tran - scripts with high sequence - identity to archival polyomavirus tumor antigen ( T antigen ) sequences . Ultimately , a full - length , (cid:2) 5 . 4 kilobase circular viral genome ( prototype MCV350 ) was sequenced from a MCC tumor and was aptly named Merkel cell polyomavirus ( Feng et al . , 2008 ) . The Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCPyV ) genome is similar to other human polyomaviruses in that it includes a conserved replication origin , as well as opposing early and late gene regions that express small and large T antigens ( sT and LT ) and VP1 , VP2 , and VP3 , respectively ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Shuda et al . , 2008 ) . While many domains of MCPyV share homology with their well - studied human polyomavirus counterparts , the MCPyV genome is most similar to the African Green Monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus and is phylogenetically classiﬁed in the murine polyomavirus clade ( Dalianis et al . , 2009 ; Feng et al . , 2008 ) . However , based on the most recent and revised taxonomical classiﬁcation of the Polyomaviridae family , MCPyV is now classiﬁed in the Orthopo - lyomavirus genus designated for mammalian virus species sharing high nucleotide sequence similarity ( Johne et al . , 2011 ) . M . E . Spurgeon , P . F . Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 120 MCPyV molecular virology : Genome organization As mentioned above , the genetic components and organization of the MCPyV genome are largely similar to other polyomaviruses ( Reviewed in Chang and Moore , 2012 ; Feng et al . , 2008 ) . The prototype virus MCV350 has a circular , double - stranded DNA genome of 5387 base - pairs , and the genomes of all subsequent MCPyV strains sequenced to date average (cid:2) 5 . 4 kilobases ( Fig . 2 ) . As is customary for polyomaviruses , the MCPyV genome contains bidirectional early and late coding regions , separated by a non - coding regulatory region that houses the viral replication origin . The segregation of the early and late transcriptional units promotes a temporally regulated cascade of gene expression distinguished by the onset of viral DNA replication , a replication scheme consistent with other DNA viruses ( Feng et al . , 2011 ) . The early genes , namely the products of the T antigen locus , are expressed immediately upon infection and are generally involved in replication of the viral DNA genome . Following DNA replication , the late region is transcription - ally activated to express gene products that are structural compo - nents of the viral capsid and contribute to progeny virion production during the late phase of infection ( Cole and Conzen , 2001 ) . Despite these similarities , the MCPyV viral genome has several unique genetic characteristics compared to other human polyomaviruses . As one example , gene products of both the early ( large and small T antigens ) and late regions ( VP1 and VP2 ) of Merkel cell polyoma - virus are more closely related to murine polyomaviruses than to the other human polyomaviruses ( Feng et al . , 2008 ) . Origin of replication The non - coding regulatory region ( NCRR ) of MCPyV contains a 71 - base pair minimum origin of replication that , like other polyomaviruses , has an AT - rich tract , LT - binding domain , and early enhancer region . However , the MCPyV origin of replication has several unique characteristics . Polyomavirus origins of repli - cation traditionally contain pentanucleotide consensus sequences G ( A / G ) GGC that help direct assembly of LT proteins on the DNA by speciﬁcally binding the origin - binding domain ( OBD ) within the central portion of LT , an event that in turn allows LT to function as a helicase and direct the initiation of viral DNA replication ( Reviewed in Cole and Conzen , 2001 ; Fanning and Zhao , 2009 ; Pipas , 1992 ) . In the MCPyV origin , however , there are more pentanucleotide sequences than any other polyomavirus , and these pentameric elements exist in closer proximity to one another than in other polyomaviral origins ( Johnson , 2010 ; Kwun et al . , 2009 ) . Kwun and colleagues suggested that this close proximity likely allows OBD – OBD interaction between LT pro - teins bound at the origin . More recently , a crystal structure of the MCPyV LT OBD in complex with a segment of the MCPyV origin of replication was reported and veriﬁes that OBD – OBD intermole - cular interactions occur on LT proteins bound to the origin of replication ( Harrison et al . , 2011 ) . As determined by mutational analysis , these OBD – OBD interactions are not required for LT binding to the origin , nor do they appear to affect the structure of the viral DNA . Such intermolecular interactions do not occur on the SV40 origin , as the OBD - binding pentanucleotide sequences are more spatially separated ( Bochkareva et al . , 2006 ; Meinke et al . , 2007 ) . Secondary - structure matching analysis reveals a striking similarity between MCPyV LT and the E1 origin - binding protein of bovine papillomavirus ( Harrison et al . , 2011 ) . The crystal structure also conﬁrmed the previous report by Kwun et al . of the unique combination of pentanucleotide sequences that are required for efﬁcient MCPyV replication . Taken together , these features indicate that replication at the MCPyV viral origin and the process of LT seeding may be somewhat distinct and more complex in comparison to other polyomaviruses . Early region : The T antigen locus The MCPyV early region spans nearly 3 kilobases of the 5 . 4 kilo - base genome , and its genes are the ﬁrst to be expressed upon infection ( Feng et al . , 2008 , 2011 ; Neumann et al . , 2011 ) . Poly - omavirus early region gene products historically target cellular proteins that function in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppres - sion ( DeCaprio et al . , 1988 ; Lane and Crawford , 1979 ; Linzer and Levine , 1979 ; Pallas et al . , 1990 ) . Because these gene products are designated as tumor antigens , or T antigens , the early region is frequently referred to as the ‘‘T antigen locus’’ . The polyomavirus T antigens also perform key functions in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis . The MCPyV early region expresses three T antigens : large T antigen ( LT ) , small T antigen ( sT ) , and 57kT antigen ( 57 kT ) ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Shuda et al . , 2008 , 2009 ) . There is no evidence that MCPyV expresses proteins analogous to middle T antigen or agnoprotein expressed by other polyomaviruses . The basic genetic features and functional domains of the three MCPyV T antigens will be reviewed in the following section . Discussion of their roles in viral replication and their potential roles in transformation and Fig . 2 . The Merkel Cell Polyomavirus ( MCPyV ) genome and capsids . ( A ) Schematic of the MCPyV prototype MCV350 . The double - stranded DNA genome is approxi - mately 5 . 4 kilobases in length . The bi - directional origin of replication ( white ) promotes temporal expression of discrete regions of the genome . The early region encodes three viral T antigens : large T antigen ( LT ; red ) , 57 kT antigen ( 57 kT ; orange ) and small t antigen ( sT ; yellow ) . The late region is transcribed in the opposite direction from the origin and encodes the viral structural proteins : the major capsid protein Virus Protein 1 ( VP1 ; green ) , and the minor capsid proteins Virus Protein 2 and Virus Protein 3 ( VP2 ; blue , VP3 ; gray ) . ( B ) Transmission electron micrograph of MCPyV virus - like particles composed of VP1 and VP2 proteins . The VP1 and VP2 proteins self - assemble into (cid:2) 50 nm icosahedral particles . ( Scale bar ¼ 100 nm ) . M . E . Spurgeon , P . F . Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 121 MCPyV - induced carcinogenesis are also described in subsequent sections . All three MCPyV T antigens share a short , common amino - terminus , but alternative splicing downstream of the ﬁrst exon ultimately gives rise to three unique proteins ( Fig . 3 ) . The MCPyV LT protein is the largest of the three T antigens and is composed of two exons that together encode for a protein of 816 amino acids . As shown in Fig . 3 , MCPyV LT has conserved features important for well - characterized LT functions , including CR1 ( LXXLL ) and DnaJ ( HPDKGG ) domains , a pRb - binding domain ( LXCXE ) , an origin - binding domain ( OBD ) , and a helicase domain ( Reviewed in Pipas , 1992 ) . For this reason , it is inferred that MCPyV LT generally shares many functions with other polyomavirus LTs . A nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) is located between the pRb - binding LXCXE motif and the OBD and is conserved in other MCPyV isolates ( Nakamura et al . , 2010 ) . The carboxyl terminal half of LT contains most of the domains involved in viral DNA replication , including the OBD , ATPase domain , and helicase domains . This region of LT is also the site of tumor - speciﬁc mutations , the signiﬁcance of which will be discussed in further detail in later sections . It should be noted that MCPyV LT is clearly distinct from other human polyomaviruses and shares only 30 % amino acid identity with their human polyomavirus counterparts ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Johnson , 2010 ) . One unique aspect of MCPyV LT is the presence of approximately 200 additional amino acids at the beginning of exon 2 just proximal to the pRb - binding LXCXE domain called the ‘‘MCV - Unique Region’’ , or MUR . The MUR region of LT binds a cellular factor , Vam6p , and redistributes it to the nucleus . This function appears to be unique to MCPyV LT ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . The MCPyV LT pRb - binding domain is unique in that it contains a ‘spacer region’ that effectively separates the ‘Psycho’ domain from the LXCXE motif , and also contains com - plementary sequence for a MCPyV viral microRNA ( Johnson , 2010 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) . This region is unique to MCPyV LT and is contained within the MUR described by Liu and colleagues , but the effects of this additional sequence on LT function have not yet been determined . In addition to LT , the T antigen locus of MCPyV encodes for a small T ( sT ) protein . As mentioned previously , the MCPyV sT protein shares the same amino terminus with LT and 57 kT ( Fig . 3 ) and therefore has conserved region 1 ( CR1 ) and heat shock protein - binding ( DnaJ ) motifs . However , transcriptional read - through of the ﬁrst exon splice site used by LT and 57 kT gives rise to a small protein of 186 amino acids with a unique carboxyl terminus that harbors a protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) binding site . The ability to bind PP2A is a conserved function of polyomavirus sT proteins and this association has been shown to play an important role in virus - induced cellular transformation by other polyomaviruses ( Pallas et al . , 1990 ) . A recent study by Shuda and colleagues provided initial insight into the functional char - acteristics of MCPyV sT protein , which include physical association between sT and the PP2A A a subunit in co - immunoprecipitation assays and promoting sustained phosphorylation of the cellular translation factor eIF4E binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) ( Shuda et al . , 2011 ) . So far , the MCPyV sT protein has been implicated in the process of viral DNA replication ( Feng et al . , 2011 ; Kwun et al . , 2009 ) and cellular transformation ( Shuda et al . , 2011 ) , both func - tions that will be explored in further detail in upcoming sections . 57 kT Location of MCC Tumor - Specific Mutations MUR 1 1000 2000 3000 sT PP2ABinding Genomic DNA LT CR1 OBD Helicase NLS pRbBinding Vam6pBinding DnaJ MCV - mIR - M1 - 5p Fig . 3 . The MCPyV T antigen locus . The MCPyV T antigen locus is located in the early region of the genome and encodes three T antigen isoforms that arise by alternative splicing . The large T antigen ( LT ) shares many traditional domains found in other polyomaviruses : CR1 ( LXXLL ; black ) , DnaJ ( HPDKGG ; pink ) , pRb - binding ( LXCXE ; red ) , a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ; orange ) , origin - binding domain ( OBD ; purple ) , and a helicase domain ( green ) . LT also contains unique features , such as a binding site for Vam6p ( blue ) and a 200 - amino acid ‘‘MCV - Unique Region’’ ( MUR ) .

The small t antigen ( sT ) shares the ﬁrst exon with LT , but due to alternative splicing also contains a protein phosphatase 2A - binding site ( PP2A ; yellow ) . The 57 kT antigen is identical to LT up to the NLS motif , at which point differential splicing precludes the inclusion of complete OBD and helicase domains . M . E . Spurgeon , P . F . Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 122 The early region also expresses a third T antigen species , 57 kT . The 57 kT protein is the product of a transcript that undergoes alternative splicing to join three exons encoding for 432 amino acids , and this protein shares many of the same motifs present in LT and sT . The 57 kT protein has the same amino terminus as both LT and sT , including the CR1 and DnaJ domains , and also contains the MUR , pRb - binding LXCXE motif , and the most C - terminal 100 amino acids that are present in LT . Information on the role of 57 kT in the viral life cycle or MCPyV - induced tumorigenesis is sparse . The 57 kT antigen is frequently described as an analog of the SV40 17 kT antigen ( Zerrahn et al . , 1993 ) , which appears to function both independently of and in cooperation with the other T antigens in the process of cellular proliferation in vivo ( Comerford et al . , 2012 ) . The late region : Structural proteins The late region of the MCPyV genome contains open reading frames for the major capsid protein viral protein 1 ( VP1 ) and the minor capsid proteins 2 and 3 ( VP2 and VP3 ) . Interestingly , MCPyV lacks the conserved genetic architecture that normally gives rise to the VP3 protein . This sequence aberration , coupled with failed attempts to create viable VP3 expression vectors ( Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) and abnormal VP1 localization reminiscent of polyomaviruses lacking a VP3 protein ( Neumann et al . , 2011 ) , suggests that MCPyV either expresses a non - functional VP3 or does not express this protein at all . Regardless , MCPyV particles composed of VP1 and VP2 , either as a result of their ectopic expression and self - assembly into virus - like particles ( VLPs ) ( Tolstov et al . , 2009 ) or from replication of genetically engineered consensus genomes ( Feng et al . , 2011 ; Neumann et al . , 2011 ; Schowalter et al . , 2011 ) , have an average particle size ( (cid:2) 40 – 55 nm ) consistent with other polyomavirus particles ( Fig . 2B ) . MCPyV microRNA The MCPyV genome expresses a 22 - nucleotide viral miRNA ( MCV - miR - M1 - 5p ) from the late strand that most likely auto - regulates early viral gene expression during the late phase of infection , as it was shown to reduce the level of reporter transcripts containing MCPyV early region sequences ( Lee et al . , 2011 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) . This miRNA has complete reverse complementarity to a sequence in LT adjacent to the LXCXE motif , implying that it targets this early protein for autoregula - tion , and is also predicted to affect a variety of cellular targets with potentially relevant functions in transformation ( Johnson , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2011 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) . One study reported that miRNA expression is preserved in approximately 50 % of MCPyV - positive MCC tumors , and the level of miRNA expression corre - lates with viral genome copy number in the tumor ( Lee et al . , 2011 ) . The presence of MCPyV miRNA in MCC tumors certainly warrants further investigation into its role , if any , in the patho - genesis of MCC . Overall , while the MCPyV genome sequence and organization is reminiscent of other members of the Polyomaviridae family , there are clearly some unique characteristics that may suggest this new human polyomavirus has evolved to have divergent mechanisms and functions for reasons not yet fully appreciated . MCPyV molecular virology : Virus life cycle and replication MCPyV was originally discovered in MCC , and it is within this malignant milieu where most of its molecular virology is cur - rently being characterized . Details regarding the naturally occur - ring life cycle and replication of MCPyV are limited as there is no cell culture system yet identiﬁed in which virus can be propagated , except for one in which viral LT and sT genes are expressed in trans . Moreover , the precise cellular tropism and cell type that supports productive MCPyV infection remain unclear . These limitations have resulted in a reliance on cell culture - based systems , combined with genetically engineered consensus gen - omes or pseudoviruses , for the study of the MCPyV life cycle and replication . Attachment and entry A report by Erickson et al . ﬁrst identiﬁed a potential cellular receptor for MCPyV ( Erickson et al . , 2009 ) . Through the use of hemagluttination and sucrose gradient ﬂotation assays , the authors found that MCPyV capsomeres composed of recombinant VP1 proteins bound sialic acid components of the ganglioside Gt1b . The results of this initial study suggested that MCPyV abides by the typical attachment and uptake processes used by other polyoma - viruses , which primarily utilize carbohydrates with sialic acid as primary receptors ( Reviewed in Neu et al . , 2009 ) . However , subsequent studies suggest a more nuanced scenario . Schowalter , Pastrana , and Buck tested the ability of MCPyV pseudovirions ( composed of VP1 , VP2 , and a luciferase reporter plasmid ) to bind and transduce encapsidated reporter DNA to the nucleus of cultured A549 cells ( Schowalter et al . , 2011 ) . They presented compelling evidence that MCPyV requires sulfated glycosamino - glycans , particularly heparan sulfate , for infectious entry . This is not unlike what is thought to be the case for papillomaviruses ( Reviewed in Horvath et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , while MCPyV pseudovirions efﬁciently bound to Lec2 cells that lack sialylated glycans like Gt1b , the particles were deﬁcient in gene transduction . These results led the authors to speculate that MCPyV utilizes a glycosaminoglycan as a primary receptor , but then requires a sialylated glycan as a post - attachment co - receptor for gene trans - duction . Determination of the MCPyV VP1 crystal structure ulti - mately supports this model ( Neu et al . , 2012 ) . Neu and colleagues identiﬁed sialic acid binding sites on VP1 that are required for a post - attachment step in MCPyV infectious entry ; however , muta - tion of these sites did not preclude initial cellular attachment of MCPyV pseudovirions . Taken together , these initial reports suggest a novel infectious entry process that requires glycosaminoglycans for initial attachment and subsequent association with sialic acid for gene transduction . The use of sialic acid as a secondary receptor by MCPyV differs from the current consensus for other polyoma - viruses ( Neu et al . , 2011 ) , and provides further evidence that this virus is unique among Polyomaviridae family members . In vitro replication studies Other recent efforts have focused on characterization of MCPyV tissue tropism and replication . The ability of a cell type or tissue to support efﬁcient infectious entry of a virus particle and ultimately support the production of infectious progeny virions can imply tropism of a virus . So far , no clear tropism has been deﬁned for MCPyV . In one report , the infectivity of MCPyV pseudovirions was determined on a panel of sixty human cancer cell lines ( NCI - 60 ) by measuring infectious entry of an encapsidated reporter gene ( Schowalter et al . , 2012 ) . While MCPyV transduced a wide spec - trum of cell types and no clear tropism emerged , human skin - derived primary keratinocytes ( HEKa ) and transformed melanocyte ( melanoma ) cell lines supported infectious entry of MCPyV pseu - dovirions . On the other hand , a transformed keratinocyte cell line ( HaCat ) and primary melanocytes were resistant to MCPyV pseu - dovirus entry . These results suggest the need for cautious inter - pretation of research using cultured cell lines to study MCPyV tropism , but may also imply that the skin is a preferential site for MCPyV infection . M . E . Spurgeon , P . F . Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 123 Others have used genetically engineered consensus viral gen - omes to study the MCPyV life cycle and the roles of cellular and host proteins in virus replication . Multiple reports were published around the same time attempting to recapitulate the virus life cycle in cultured cells ( Feng et al . , 2011 ; Neumann et al . , 2011 ; Schowalter et al . , 2011 ) . In the reports by Feng and Neumann , consensus MCPyV genomes were synthesized that each share high homology to DNA found within encapsidated virions shed from healthy human skin ( Schowalter et al . , 2010 ) . In the report by Feng et al . , weak viral DNA replication and expression of all three T antigen species ( LT , sT , 57 kT ) and VP1 were detected by Southern blot and immunoblot , respectively , 2 – 5 days following transfection of circularized MCV - HF DNA genome into 293 cells . Likewise , Neumann et al . observed replicated genomic DNA and expression of both LT and VP1 transcripts and protein following transfection of circularized MCV - Syn DNA genome . Acknowledging widely variable transfection efﬁciencies between cell lines , only 3 out of 22 lines tested supported early and late gene expression : human embryonic kidney cells ( 293 ) , human non - small cell lung carcinoma cells ( H1299 ) , and a human neuroectodermal cell line ( PFSK - 1 ) ( Neumann et al . , 2011 ) . Both groups observed gene expression kinetics consistent with a systematic early to late cascade of gene expression that culminated in the detection of virus particles by approximately 4 days post - transfection , although Neumann et al . observed smaller and more irregularly shaped MCPyV particles than the SV40 counterparts synthesized in a parallel control experiment . In the study by Schowalter et al . , 2011 , MCPyV virions produced in 293TT cells cotransfected with a viral genome isolated from healthy skin and VP1 / 2 expression vectors were used to infect a cell line expressing the MCPyV LT and sT genes in trans ( 293 - 4T ) . Over a several week period , modest replication of the input viral DNA genome and synthesis of VP1 protein was observed , as well as production of new virus particles ( as judged by quantifying yield of virions from cell culture following lysis of the cells ) . This experi - mental system , while artiﬁcal in that LT and sT are being expressed in trans , comes the closest , to date , to providing the means to study the full life cycle of MCPyV in a laboratory setting , and an efﬁcient means for producing the virus . Viral and cellular factors involved in replication The cellular and viral genes required for efﬁcient MCPyV replication are also coming into focus . Based on other polyoma - virus replication schemes , the MCPyV T antigens would be expected to play critical roles in the virus life cycle . Results of in vitro studies on the MCPyV origin of replication conﬁrm these predictions , revealing that LT activity is required for efﬁcient DNA replication and is greatly enhanced by sT ( Kwun et al . , 2009 ) . The 57 kT antigen does not appear to play a role in replication , and its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown . Mutational analysis of sT indicates that association with PP2A is required for its ability to enhance LT’s viral DNA replication function . Interestingly , the shared DnaJ motif in the amino terminal portion of LT / sT ( Fig . 3 ) is required for LT function in replication , but is dispensable in the context of sT’s ability to augment LT’s DNA replication functions . The role of LT and sT in viral DNA replica - tion is supported by in vitro replication studies . Replication of consensus genomes is greatly enhanced by co - expressing sT , and to a lesser extent LT ( Feng et al . , 2011 ) , or by supplying the early region in trans ( Neumann et al . , 2011 ) . And as described above , 293 - 4T cells , which constitutively express both MCPyV LT and sT proteins , could support not only replication but also produce virions when infected with MCPyV virus ( Schowalter et al . , 2011 ) . So far , Vam6p is the only cellular factor shown to affect MCPyV replication , which greatly antagonizes MCPyV replication through its interaction with LT ( Feng et al . , 2011 ) . Transmission studies Despite the advances made in understanding MCPyV replica - tion through in vitro replication assays , all experiments have so far failed to detect cytopathic effect ( CPE ) or robust serial transmission of virions produced in these culture systems . Co - culture of 293 cells transfected with the MCV - HF DNA genome , in which early and late genes are expressed and virus particles were detected , with naı¨ve cell populations failed to promote secondary virus infection or CPE ( Feng et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , repeated freeze / thaw cycles to release cell - associated virions also failed to promote horizontal spread of MCPyV virus ( Neumann et al . , 2011 ) . These ﬁndings indicate that a bona ﬁde experimental system for MCPyV virus propagation in the laboratory has not yet been fully developed . It has now been established that MCPyV DNA ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Foulongne et al . , 2010a , 2010b ; Loyo et al . , 2010 ; Wieland et al . , 2009 ) and encapsidated virions ( Schowalter et al . , 2010 ) can be detected on normal human skin . The location of MCPyV detection supports the notion that MCPyV is part of the normal microﬂora of human skin . In fact , the primary events of MCPyV replication have been shown to occur in cultured monolayers of primary keratinocytes , which are a prominent cell type of the skin and other stratiﬁed epithelia ( Schowalter et al . , 2011 ) . Taken together with the difﬁculty in reproducing the MCPyV virus life cycle in monolayer cell culture , especially the production of infectious progeny virions and sub - sequent virus transmission , these ﬁndings may imply a depen - dence on the process of differentiation in the stratiﬁed epithelium of the skin . Through this consideration , the potential to formulate a better model of MCPyV tissue tropism and virus propagation can be developed . The understanding of the context of a natural MCPyV infection , including its life cycle , host range , and the isolation of intact virus , remains limited but these discoveries will certainly provide insight into the relation of MCPyV to other polyomaviruses . MCPyV epidemiology Since its discovery in 2008 , epidemiological studies have established MCPyV as a common virus infecting the human population . Enzyme immunoassays speciﬁc for the immunogenic determinant of MCPyV , the major capsid protein VP1 , have been used to determine that up to 80 % of the adult population contains serum antibodies to MCPyV ( Carter et al . , 2009 ; Kean et al . , 2009 ; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ; Tolstov et al . , 2011 ; Tolstov et al . , 2009 ; Touze et al . , 2010 ) . Seropositivity to MCPyV is essentially nonexistent in prenatal blood spots ( Gustafsson et al . , 2012 ) , yet becomes widely prevalent in children in their ﬁrst decade of life and continues to increase with age , suggesting exposure to the virus occurs during early childhood ( Chen et al . , 2011 ; Kean et al . , 2009 ; Tolstov et al . , 2009 ; Viscidi et al . , 2011 ) . By monitoring overt symptoms along - side seroconversion of MCPyV - seronegative individuals , it appears that MCPyV infection is mostly asymptomatic ( Tolstov et al . , 2011 ) . Viral DNA has been detected in a wide variety of anatomical locations , including the respiratory tract ( Babakir - Mina et al . , 2010 ; Bialasiewicz et al . , 2009 ; Goh et al . , 2009 ; Kantola et al . , 2009 ) , saliva ( Foulongne et al . , 2010b ; Loyo et al . , 2010 ) , lymphoid tissues ( Sharp et al . , 2009 ; Shuda et al . , 2009 ; Toracchio et al . , 2010 ) , urine ( Boﬁll - Mas et al . , 2010 ; Husseiny et al . , 2010 ; Laude et al . , 2010 ; Mertz et al . , 2010 ) , and the gastrointestinal tract ( Campello et al . , 2011 ; Feng et al . , 2008 ) . Viral DNA detection in these locations is relatively low compared to the skin , where both viral DNA and encapsidated virions can be detected ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Foulongne et al . , 2010a , 2010b ; Loyo et al . , 2010 ; Schowalter et al . , 2010 ; Wieland et al . , 2009 ) . No route of transmission for MCPyV has been validated , but available data supports several M . E . Spurgeon , P . F . Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 124 possibilities . For instance , the presence of viral DNA in the gut , gastrointestinal tract , and urban sewage suggests a fecal - oral mode of transmission ( Boﬁll - Mas et al . , 2010 ; Campello et al . , 2011 ; Loyo et al . , 2010 ) , while presence in the aerodigestive tract supports a respiratory route ( Babakir - Mina et al . , 2010 ; Kantola et al . , 2009 ; Tolstov et al . , 2009 ) . The discovery that nuclease - resistant MCPyV DNA ( presumably encapsidated virus ) is chronically shed from the skin ( Schowalter et al . , 2010 ) and is present on a variety of environmental surfaces ( Foulongne et al . , 2011 ) , along with the emerging hypothesis that the MCPyV life cycle may be linked to cellular differentiation , could imply a mode of transmission that stems from cutaneous shedding of MCPyV virus . MCPyV and MCC : Association and evidence for causality Merkel cell polyomavirus was originally isolated from MCC tissue samples . In the hallmark report announcing their discovery of MCPyV , Feng and colleagues established the initial framework for a causal relationship between the virus and MCC ( Feng et al . , 2008 ) . There are now several lines of evidence that suggest MCPyV is an etiological agent of MCC . One of the most unequi - vocal ﬁndings is the presence of the viral genome in a majority of MCCs . Using PCR to detect MCPyV - speciﬁc sequences , Feng et al . reported the presence of MCPyV in 8 out of 10 ( 80 % ) MCC tumors tested . Since this original report , there has been widespread conﬁrmation of these results that together indicate around 75 % of MCCs contain MCPyV DNA ( Andres et al . , 2009 ; Becker et al . , 2009a ; Busam et al . , 2009 ; Carter et al . , 2009 ; Duncavage et al . , 2009 ; Fischer et al . , 2010 ; Garneski et al . , 2009 ; Kassem et al . , 2008 ; Katano et al . , 2009 ; Loyo et al . , 2010 ; Sastre - Garau et al . , 2009 ; Varga et al . , 2009 ) . In the 8 MCPyV - positive MCCs originally analyzed , the viral genome copy number was subsequently found to average at least 1 copy per tumor cell ( Shuda et al . , 2009 ) , although a vast range of viral copy numbers have since been reported ( Bhatia et al . , 2010b ; Houben et al . , 2010a ; Katano et al . , 2009 ; Laude et al . , 2010 ) . Along these lines , MCC patients were found to have much higher MCPyV antibody titers than the general public , even if the tumor tested negative for the virus , indicating a strong association between MCPyV and MCC and a possible viral role in tumor initiation ( Carter et al . , 2009 ; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ; Tolstov et al . , 2009 ; Viscidi et al . , 2011 ) . Perhaps one of the more persuasive pieces of evidence sup - porting the theory that MCPyV is an etiological factor of MCC is clonal integration of the viral genome into the cellular genomes of MCC tumors ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Laude et al . , 2010 ; Martel - Jantin et al . , 2012 ; Sastre - Garau et al . , 2009 ) and some MCC cell lines ( Fischer et al . , 2010 ) . MCC tumor metastases are also MCPyV - positive and share the same integration pattern as the original tumor ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Laude et al . , 2010 ) . Collectively , these ﬁndings strongly suggest MCPyV virus infection occurs in a cell that ultimately gives rise to neoplastic growth and clonal expan - sion . The virus appears to integrate as head - to - tail concatemers at distinct locations randomly distributed throughout the cellular genome , and any evidence for cellular ‘hot - spots’ of viral integration does not currently exist ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Laude et al . , 2010 ; Martel - Jantin et al . , 2012 ; Sastre - Garau et al . , 2009 ) . The precise mechan - isms that direct integration of the MCPyV genome and the contribu - tion of exogenous inﬂuences in this process are not yet understood . Another line of evidence supporting causality is the retention of MCPyV gene expression in MCCs . Transcripts for MCPyV T antigens are consistently detected in MCC tumors ( Feng et al . , 2008 ; Sastre - Garau et al . , 2009 ; Shuda et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , MCPyV T antigen protein expression has been observed in MCC tumor sections by immunohistochemistry ( Bhatia et al . , 2010a ; Busam et al . , 2009 ; Shuda et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . Most , but not all , MCC tumors are positive for MCPyV LT , and only cells within the tumor are reactive to LT antibodies while neighboring tissue is negative ( Shuda et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , many tumors negative for LT exhibit positive staining with an antibody speciﬁc to sT , and additional analysis suggests that sT is actually more frequently expressed in MCC tumors than LT ( Shuda et al . , 2011 ) . The signiﬁcance of T antigen expression to MCPyV - induced carcino - genesis is strongly reinforced by the ﬁnding that their expression is required for growth of MCPyV - infected MCC cell lines . In a study by Houben et . al . , shRNAs targeting the ﬁrst exon shared by all T antigens were used to knockdown T antigen expression in MCC cell lines , resulting in impeded cell proliferation and survival ( Houben et al . , 2010b ) . The individual requirements for LT and sT in MCPyV - positive MCC cell growth were further dissected using shRNA speciﬁcally targeting sT antigen . Whereas sT knockdown inhibited cell growth to a level comparable to knockdown of all T antigens , it did not promote the robust cell cycle arrest or cell death seen in cells with pan - T antigen knockdown ( Shuda et al . , 2011 ) . These data suggest that LT and sT most likely contribute to MCPyV - induced carcinogenesis via distinct mechanisms , but are both required for optimal MCC tumor cell growth . A common characteristic of viral oncogenesis is a combination of events that renders the virus incapable of replication , yet still proﬁcient in the induction of cellular proliferation ( Reviewed in Moore and Chang , 2010 ) . Clearly , integration of the MCPyV genome creates a barrier to virus replication , as explained below , but there are also features of tumor - associated MCPyV genomes that further suggest a strong selective pressure within MCCs to abrogate virus replication while preserving proliferative func - tions . Several groups have reported mutations in the origin of replication and VP1 gene in MCC - derived MCPyV genomic sequences that prevent efﬁcient replication and progeny virion production , respectively ( Feng et al . , 2011 ; Kassem et al . , 2008 ; Kwun et al . , 2009 ; Neumann et al . , 2011 ) . However , the most common tumor - speciﬁc MCPyV mutations occur in the LT anti - gen . The LT antigen sequences in almost all tumor - derived MCPyV isolates and MCC cell lines analyzed to date contain mutations within exon 2 that prematurely truncate the LT protein ( Fischer et al . , 2010 ; Katano et al . , 2009 ; Laude et al . , 2010 ; Shuda et al . , 2008 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Strikingly , these mutations all occur within the carboxy terminus of LT at sites downstream of the LXCXE Rb - binding motif . This consistent , tumor - speciﬁc mutational pattern gives rise to truncated LT antigens in which the CR1 , DnaJ , MUR , NLS , and pRb - binding motifs are preserved , yet domains asso - ciated with replication are lost . Indeed , truncated LT proteins can still co - immunoprecipitate pRb but are defective for origin - binding and viral helicase activities , and are thus no longer functional in replication assays ( Shuda et al . , 2008 ) . These muta - tions in LT lie within a region that does not affect the coding capacity for sT . The presence of tumor - speciﬁc mutations within the MCPyV genome is compelling evidence that the virus has lost the capacity to replicate in MCC tumors , but retains motifs with potential to contribute to uncontrolled proliferation . Given the preponderance of evidence associating MCPyV with MCC , the knowledge that MCPyV genes are required for the growth of MCC - derived cell lines , and the transforming potential of MCPyV genes , it is not surprising that the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer has recently classiﬁed MCPyV as a group 2A carcinogen , a designation meaning it is ‘‘probably carcinogenic to humans’’ ( Bouvard et al . , 2012 ) . Potential mechanisms of MCPyV transformation Considering the status of the MCPyV genome and T antigens found in MCC tissue , several mechanisms of virus - induced M . E . Spurgeon , P . F . Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 125 transformation are plausible . The most obvious pathways involve the constitutive expression of LT and sT proteins . Using SV40 as a reference ( Reviewed in Ahuja et al . , 2005 ; Khalili et al . , 2008 ; Hahn et al . , 2002 ) , one might hypothesize that MCPyV LT is the main viral oncoprotein and sT plays an accessory role in trans - formation by MCPyV . However , emerging data is starting to support the already accumulating evidence that MCPyV is unique with respect to other polyomaviruses . Multiple groups have observed that pan - T antigen knockdown in MCC cell lines con - tributes to robust cell death and cell cycle arrest ( Houben et al . , 2010b ; Shuda et al . , 2011 ) . This data suggests that MCC tumor cells are ‘addicted’ to the MCPyV T antigen proteins . But , is one T antigen more oncogenic than the other ? Is either T antigen sufﬁcient for transformation ? Many of the studies directed at discerning a role for T antigens in MCPyV - induced transformation have been complicated by the fact that all T antigens were initially targeted for knockdown simultaneously through the use of shRNAs speciﬁc to the common ﬁrst exon . While one report did pinpoint a requirement for the pRb - binding motif in the ability of LT to promote growth of MCPyV - positive MCC cell lines and xenografts ( Houben et al . , 2012a ) , most of these studies could not distinguish between the independent roles of LT and sT in transformation . In 2011 , Shuda and colleagues speciﬁcally tar - geted sT with shRNA , and the individual oncogenic potential of MCPyV LT and sT began to come into focus ( Shuda et al . , 2011 ) . In several different traditional in vitro transformation assays per - formed in both rodent and human cells , sT exhibited an increased transformation capacity compared to LT , which had very little phenotype in these assays . Any transformation capacity of LT was minimal compared to sT , although truncated LT showed more proliferative capacity than full - length LT . Moreover , the sT trans - formation activity was not enhanced by the presence of LT , although this was only tested in one of many assays . These results make an extremely convincing argument that sT is the dominant MCPyV oncoprotein ; however , the authors caution that sT alone did not fully transform human cells and pose a reminder that speciﬁc sT knockdown does not phenocopy knockdown of all T antigens in MCC cell lines . So while this data suggests that LT expression alone is not sufﬁcient for MCPyV - induced transforma - tion , it appears necessary for optimal transformation by the MCPyV T antigen locus . How these in vitro transformation phenotypes relate to in vivo tumorigenicity properties of MCPyV remains unclear . The most widely characterized function of polyomavirus sT antigens is the ability to bind and reprogram the cellular protein phosphatase PP2A , a function that is intimately tied to its ability to promote cell cycle progression and transformation ( Reviewed in Khalili et al . , 2008 ; Pallas et al . , 1990 ) . Interestingly , mutational disruption of the PP2A - binding site of MCPyV sT did not affect its ability to promote transformation , which represents a major departure from dogma on polyomavirus biology ( Shuda et al . , 2011 ) . Rather , sT was found to preserve hyperphosphorylation of the cellular translation factor eIF4E - binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) in an mTOR - dependent manner . Hyperphosphorylation of 4E - BP1 remained high in the presence of sT with a mutated PP2A - binding site , suggesting this function of sT does not require sT : PP2A association . This post - translational modiﬁcation was conﬁrmed in four MCPyV - positive MCC cell lines and was abolished follow - ing shRNA - mediated sT knockdown . The 4E - BP1 protein binds to the cap - binding protein eIF4E , but upon phosphorylation liberates eIF4E to participate in a rate - limiting step of cap - dependent translation ( Pause et al . , 1994 ) . That sT increases association of eIF4E and another accessory factor , eIF4G , with the 5 0 - methyl - 7 - guanosine cap in cap - binding assays is consistent with its ability to preserve 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation . It therefore seems likely that sT promotes a favorable cellular environment for active cap - dependent translation . Most importantly , the ability of sT to preserve 4E - BP1 phosphorylation , which occurs independent of its association with PP2A , is necessary for its role in driving cellular transformation . Given that sT is more frequently expressed in MCC than LT , together with its transformation capacity in vitro , it seems likely that MCPyV sT may play a more dominant role than LT in MCPyV - mediated tumorigenicity . Additional studies have added insight into other potential mechanisms of MCPyV - induced carcinogenesis . For instance , although Akt is phosphorylated in almost 90 % of MCCs , this modiﬁcation is not associated with MCPyV status and is not affected by LT / sT antigen knockdown in MCPyV - positive MCCs ( Hafner et al . , 2012 ) . These results mirror those reported by Shuda et al . showing that MCPyV sT interaction with PP2A did not activate Akt ( Shuda et al . , 2011 ) . Together , these data suggest that MCPyV oncoproteins are not involved in promoting the high Akt activation observed in MCC . The general lack of p53 mutations in MCPyV - positive MCCs is also noteworthy . As mentioned previously , p53 mutations that bear signatures consistent with UV - B exposure have been detected in MCC cell lines ( Popp et al . , 2002 ) . However , this study was conducted prior to discovery of MCPyV and thus the viral status of these MCC cell lines is unclear . More recently , the status of p53 was analyzed in both MCPyV - positive and MCPyV - negative MCC tumors ( Sihto et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , an inverse correla - tion between p53 expression and viral DNA copy number was observed , and only 7 % of MCPyV - positive MCC tumors expressed detectable p53 . Moreover , any p53 mutations observed in MCCs were almost exclusively detected in MCPyV - negative MCCs . These ﬁndings suggest that aberrant expression of mutated p53 is most likely not a major driver of MCPyV - associated tumorigenesis . It remains unclear whether MCPyV is functioning to inactivate the p53 pathway , thereby eliminating any selective advantage that mutations in p53 might provide to MCPyV - positive MCCs . Finally , Houben et al . recently described a MCPyV - positive MCC cell line in which proliferation is completely unaffected by T antigen knockdown ( Houben et al . , 2012b ) , which may suggest a hit - and - run mechanism of transformation . The link between MCC and ultraviolet exposure may also provide clues to viral patho - genesis . For instance , the MCPyV non - coding regulatory region can be activated in vitro by UV exposure , and human skin samples exposed to solar simulated radiation exhibited a dose - dependent increase in sT transcript levels ( Mogha et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , a MCPyV - infected MCC cell line showed impaired DNA damage repair and cell cycle arrest following exposure to UV radiation that was subsequently linked to LT , suggesting the presence of the virus affects normal repair mechanisms in cells exposed to UV ( Demetriou et al . , 2012 ) . Clearly , the ongoing study of this new human tumor virus will generate valuable knowledge about the pathogenesis of MCPyV - induced MCC . Conclusions and future perspectives The biological and epidemiological characteristics of MCPyV culminate in the following hypothetical model for MCPyV - associated tumorigenesis ( For more thorough reviews , see Bhatia et al . , 2011 ; Chang and Moore , 2012 ; Moore and Chang , 2010 ) . By all accounts , the virus is obtained during early childhood via transmission by either fecal - oral , respiratory , or cutaneous routes and results in a mostly asymptomatic primary infection . The virus is maintained as part of the normal microﬂora of mainly the skin , where it is chronically shed in the form of encapsidated virions . Localized or systemic compromises to the immune system , brought on by UV radiation , natural aging , AIDS , or drug - induced suppres - sion of the immune system such as occurs in organ transplant M . E . Spurgeon , P . F . Lambert / Virology 435 ( 2013 ) 118 – 130 126 recipients , are likely to lead to less effective host immune surveil - lance and subsequent virus reactivation . At this point , at least two mutational events occur that are critical steps in the proposed model of MCPyV - induced carcinogenesis . One mutational event is the integration of the viral genome into the host chromosome . The exogenous forces responsible for this event have not yet been determined , but hypotheses range from UV and ionizing radiation exposure to a defect in the virus itself . Moreover , the question of whether Merkel cells are in fact the cell type where this integration occurs , or if another prominent cell type in the skin is targeted , has not been answered . An additional event important in MCPyV - induced carcinogenesis is mutation of the viral genome in a manner that renders the virus unable to replicate . The most common mutations occur in the carboxy terminus of LT , which generate a truncated LT that lacks the helicase domain required for replication yet preserve its oncogenic functions . Because essentially all MCPyV - positive MCC tumors express truncated LT , it seems likely a strong selective pressure is implemented for replication - defective viruses . The exact order of these two events has not been directly tested or elucidated . One could envision viral genome integration as the ﬁrst event , which would lead to unlicensed DNA synthesis and provoca - tion of a cellular response leading to cell death , and LT truncation as the second event that prevents this replication and thereby protects the nascent tumor cell from its deleterious effects . An alternative scenario where LT truncations occur ﬁrst followed by viral genome integration also seems possible . It has been shown that expression of truncated LT leads to defective DNA repair and cell cycle arrest in response to UV radiation ( Demetriou et al . , 2012 ) . Consequentially , this increase in genomic instability may promote integration of the viral genome harboring mutated LT sequences . Regardless of the sequence of events , persistent expression of truncated LT and sT from the integrated MCPyV genome can inactivate pRb tumor suppressor function and promote and / or deregulate cap - dependent translation initiation , respectively . Ultimately , the cells in which integration of a replication - defective MCPyV is successful become addicted to viral oncogene expression and undergo clonal expan - sion and neoplastic progression to cause development of MCC . It should be noted that this hypothetical model might not be exclusive to the development of MCC . The presence of MCPyV DNA in a variety of other cancers has been evaluated since its link to MCC was reported . Many such analyses have discounted a role of MCPyV in some cancers , including mesotheliomas ( Bhatia et al . , 2010c ) , hematolymphoid cancers ( Shuda et al . , 2009 ) , melanomas ( Varga et al . , 2009 ) and colon cancer ( Campello et al . , 2011 ) . However , for other cancers there are contradictory ﬁndings . A great amount of conﬂicting information exists regarding the role of MCPyV in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( Reviewed in Chang and Moore , 2012 ) . Additionally , contradictory data also exists for the relationship between squa - mous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) and MCPyV . Some groups report no signiﬁcant association ( Andres et al . , 2010 ; Reisinger et al . , 2010 ) , whereas others point to the presence of MCPyV DNA in 40 % of cutaneous SCCs , which signiﬁcantly correlates with MCPyV ser - opositivity ( Rollison et al . , 2012 ) , and to the presence of MCPyV DNA in SCCs prior to the development of MCC ( Kaibuchi - Noda et al . , 2011 ) . Strikingly , Dworkin et . al . detected mutations within exon 2 of nearly all MCPyV - positive SCCs , and these mutations theoretically produce truncated LT ( Dworkin et al . , 2009 ) . Another report observed MCPyV at a high frequency in both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas ( Kassem et al . , 2009 ) . Finally , a full - length MCPyV genome ( MCV - TKS ) was isolated from a Kaposi’s sarcoma that expresses a truncated LT reminiscent of isolates detected in MCCs ( Katano et al . , 2009 ) . In conclusion , MCC may not be the end of the story for MCPyV and human cancers . The discovery of MCPyV and its apparent contribution to MCC serves to highlight the continued signiﬁcance of the polyomavirus and DNA tumor virus ﬁelds . The current renaissance of collective interest in polyomavirus research and tumor virology , coupled with continuous technical advances , has already stimulated the discovery of new human viruses . Through the use of rolling - circle ampliﬁcation , consensus PCR , and deep sequencing , six new human polyomaviruses have been discovered since the isolation of MCPyV in 2008 ( Buck et al . , 2012 ; Sauvage et al . , 2011 ; Schowalter et al . , 2010 ; Scuda et al . , 2011 ; Siebrasse et al . , 2012 ; van der Meijden et al . , 2010 ) . While most details of its molecular virology are still being elucidated , it is clear that MCPyV is unique within the Polyomaviridae family in many respects . Isolation of a naturally occurring , intact MCPyV will certainly excite and expe - dite the process of learning more about its life cycle , lytic infection , and host range . These molecular details will help reconcile the known mechanisms of MCC pathogenesis with the etiological role of MCPyV in this human cancer . More thrilling , however , is the inherent potential this new human polyomavirus has to expose pre - existing , yet uncovered , molecular mechanisms involved in cell biology , virology , and carcinogenesis .
