A discovery - based mass spectrometry lipidomic approach has been applied to identify metabolites of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide ( N - arachidonylethanolamide ) . Previously , a model system was established to show that anandamide can be recycled by cells to form new endocannabinoids suggesting recycling of the arachidonate carbon chain . We hypothesized that distinct cellular pathways exist to direct the anandamide - derived arachidonate chain into a speciﬁc set of metabolites , different from the metabolite pool that is comprised of non - anandamide - derived arachidonic acid . Using stable isotope encoding and liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry , we identiﬁed a distinct pool of lipid metabolites derived from exogenous anandamide or arachidonicacidinRBL - 2H3cells . Wediscoveredthatarachidonicacid - derivedmetaboliteswereprimar - ily comprised of the eicosanoid lipid class , whereas anandamide - derived arachidonic acid , in addition to eicosanoids , was metabolized into diradylglycerols , fatty acid amides , sterols , and glycerophospholipids . From the list of anandamide metabolites of particular interest was 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine . Furthermore , wedeterminedthatwhile1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine may be a metabolite of anandamide , the sn - 2 compound was more abundant in mouse brain tissue . Overall , our results provide a novel approach to study the metabolic fate of endocannabinoids and fatty acid - derived signaling molecules . © 2010 Elsevier B . V . All rights reserved . 1 . Introduction Lipidomic approaches provide a new opportunity to explore the biology of hydrophobic molecules such as fatty acids . Analysis of metabolism using lipidomics can assist in the discovery of new pathwaysinvolvedinthebiotransformationoflipid - derivedsignal - ing molecules . Such pathways can be explored as potentially novel targets for pharmacological manipulation . We have been particu - larly interested in the metabolism of the endogenous cannabinoids suchasanandamide ( AEA ) and2 - arachidonylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) . These endocannabinoids mimic the actions of the main active ingredi - ent in marijuana (cid:2) 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( (cid:2) 9 - THC ) and produce pharmacologic effects similar to plant - derived cannabinoids [ 1 , 2 ] . AEA , 2AG , as well as (cid:2) 9 - THC target the G protein - coupled CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors [ 1 , 2 ] . AEA has also been shown to have agonist activity at the vanilloid receptor ( VR1 ) that is a ∗ Corresponding author . Tel . : + 1 765 494 9940 ; fax : + 1 765 494 1414 .

Both AEA and 2 - AG have been linked to ret - rograde signaling in the CNS [ 5 ] . Additionally , endocannabinoids modulate many diverse biological targets , and therefore may play a role in physiological processes such as pain , nausea , reproduc - tion , immune response , and cancer [ 6 , 7 ] . Characterization and pharmacologicmanipulationoftheendocannabinoidsystemoffers potential avenues for dietary or therapeutic intervention in many disorders without the undesirable psychotropic side effects that plant - derived cannabinoids produce . The proﬁles of 2 - AG and AEA inactivation are similar and cellu - lar uptake of these molecules result in signal termination [ 8 ] . Our previous efforts demonstrated that AEA uptake may occur via a non - clathrin - mediated endocytic process that is rapid , saturable , and temperature - dependent [ 9 , 10 ] . The identity of the protein ( s ) involved in the transport of both 2 - AG and AEA , however , is not known . Following uptake , 2 - AG may be hydrolyzed either by fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) or monoacylglycerol lipase to yield arachidonic acid ( ARA ) and glycerol , whereas AEA is hydrolyzed by FAAH into ARA and ethanolamine [ 11 – 15 ] .

Placzek et al . / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 53 ( 2010 ) 567 – 575 clear evidence that AEA and 2 - AG may be metabolized by other enzymes as well leading to a variety of lipid species , some of which may have signiﬁcant biological activity [ 16 – 19 ] . Although many other pathways have been identiﬁed that may contribute to the biotransformations of AEA , the extent to which these pathways may be involved is not completely understood . Single pathway analysis using conventional approaches limits the ability to explore these alternative pathways . Therefore , in order to improve our understanding of endocannabinoid biology , new high content approaches examining multiple metabolic pathways would be useful . An approach to study and identify new pathways and their constituent protein components can involve tracking the metabolic fate of fatty acid chain pools derived from endocannabi - noids . We previously discovered that AEA metabolites , ARA and ethanolamine , are trafﬁcked to the plasma membrane accumulat - ing in the lipid raft microdomain region of the cell [ 9 ] . Lipid rafts are specialized microdomains in the plasma membrane that are enriched in ARA , cholesterol , plasmenylethanolamine , and sphin - golipids [ 20 , 21 ] . Furthermore , RBL - 2H3 cells were discovered to recyclethearachidonatechainderivedfromexogenousAEAtoform newAEAand2 - AGmolecules , aprocesswerefertoasendocannabi - noid recycling [ 22 ] . In order to detect AEA and 2 - AG molecules from RBL - 2H3 cells , we previously used thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) analysis [ 22 ] . The drawback of this method is that even though the detection of AEAand2 - AGisachievedwithoutdifﬁculty , aproﬁleofmetabolites is not easily resolved or characterized . We propose that pathways may exist to direct the AEA - derived arachidonate chain into a set of metabolites that may differ from the metabolite pool that is com - prised of non - AEA - derived ARA . In the present study , we focused onidentifyinglowmolecularweightlipidmoleculesthatarisefrom AEA and ARA metabolism in cells . The cellular metabolites of AEA and ARA were pursued by the use of a mass spectrometry method using silver coordination to the arachidonate backbone of AEA and ARA and the metabolite species were analyzed using liquid chromatography – mass spec - trometry ( LC – MS ) . Accurate mass measurement capabilities were enhanced by the use of a quadrupole time - of - ﬂight ( Q - TOF ) instru - ment . A major technical issue in LC – MS analysis of lipids , i . e . poor ionization efﬁciency of endocannabinoid molecules , was overcome by adding silver to the mobile phase [ 23 ] . Once validated , the mass spectrometry method was employed with a stable isotope encoding approach to study the metabolites of AEA and identify species into which the arachidonate backbone derived from AEA or ARA incorporated . The accurate mass measurement of the Q - TOF instrument in concert with enhanced sensitivity introduced by using silver provided us with a unique method to identify lipid molecules . Themethodshouldbereadilyappliedasadiscoverytool to study various small molecules , containing double bonds with partially unﬁlled d - orbitals , that poorly ionize under standard con - ditions in mass spectrometry analysis . Furthermore , the results of this study may provide new opportunities to study the unique pat - tern of molecules associated with various physiological events that endocannabinoids modulate . 2 . Experimental 2 . 1 . HPLC / MS analysis The LC / MS method was based on the protocol by Kingsley and Marnett , with some modiﬁcations [ 23 ] . The chromatography was conducted on a Waters Alliance 2795 HPLC system ( Milford , MA , USA ) . Separation was performed using a Thermo HyPurity Advance column ( 100mm × 2 . 1mm , 3 (cid:2) m ) , maintained at a temperature of 35 ◦ C and a ﬂow rate of 0 . 3ml / min . The mobile phase contained solvents A and B , where A was 70 (cid:2) M silver acetate in water and B was 70 (cid:2) M silver acetate in a 90 % methanol 10 % water solution . The gradient began with a 1min hold at 55 % B , increased linearly to 99 % B at 13min , was held at 99 % B for 2min , and returned to the original composition of 55 % B composition at 16min . The column was equilibrated back to the initial conditions between injections for 6min . The HPLC system was coupled to a Micromass QTof - micro ( Manchester , UK ) mass spectrometer equipped with an electro - spray source operated in positive ion mode . Source parameters were optimized to maximize the detection of AEA . The instrument was mass calibrated against a sodium formate reference solution prior to each use . The source temperature was set at 120 ◦ C with a cone gas ﬂow of 50L / h , a desolvation gas temperature of 350 ◦ C , and a nebulization gas ﬂow of 700L / h . The capillary voltage was set at 3 . 5kV and the cone voltage to 35V . A scan time of 960ms with an inter - scan delay of 100ms was used . Data were collected from m / z 100 – 1000 in continuum mode , using Waters MassLynx ( v . 4 . 0 SP4 ) software . The quantiﬁcation method for AEA and 2 - AG was validated over the range 0 . 014 – 1 . 4 (cid:2) M by demonstrating appropriate standard curve ﬁt ( quadratic , n = 7 , R 2 = 0 . 994 ) , preci - sion ( n = 5 , RSD = 3 . 1 % ) , limit of detection ( 15fmol injected ) , and recovery ( spiked standard greater than 75 % ) . LC / MS / MS was performed as above , using argon as the collision - ally induced dissociation gas at 22eV . Lock mass correction was utilized using reserpine at a deﬁned mass of 609 . 2807amu . 2 . 2 . Labeling of the lipid metabolites RBL - 2H3 cells , maintained in DMEM with 5 % fetal clone I and 5 % bovine calf serum supplemented with 2mM l - glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin in a CO 2 - containing ( 5 % ) humidiﬁed envi - ronment at 37 ◦ C , were plated in 150 - mm tissue culture plates . Twenty - fourhoursafterplating , onepopulationofcellswastreated with normal isotopic abundance AEA ( 10 (cid:2) M ) and the other with deuterated d 8 - AEA ( 10 (cid:2) M ) ( deuterium atoms at the 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , and 15 positions ; Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI ) . Each population was grown for the next 24h at 37 ◦ C , allowing the endo - cannabinoidspeciestometabolizeandincorporateintothecellular lipid pools . In the experiment that was designed to evaluate ARA metabolites , RBL - 2H3 cells were treated with 10 (cid:2) M ARA or 10 (cid:2) M deuterated ( d 8 ) - ARA ( deuterium atoms at the 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , and 15 positions ; Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI ) . For the assay , cells were washed twice with Krebs - Ringer Hepes ( KRH ) buffer ( 120mMNaCl , 4 . 7mMKCl , 1 . 2mMKH 2 PO 4 , 1 . 2mMMgSO 4 , 10mM Hepes and 2 . 2mM CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 1 ) at 37 ◦ C with 0 . 5 % fatty acid free BSAandoncewithKRHbufferwithoutBSA . KRHbufferwithoutBSA was then added to each plate , and the cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C for 10min . In the experiment that evaluated how metabolite pools change upon stimulation , the cells pre - labeled with deuterated lipids were stimulated with ionomycin ( 1 (cid:2) M , 10min 37 ◦ C ) while cells pre - labeled with non - deuterated lipids were treated with buffercontrol . Inbothcases , theassaybufferwasdiscardedafterthe incubation , 1mL of 1 : 1 mixture of cold methanol and acetonitrile was immediately added to each sample , and cells were scrapped off the plate . Next both of the cell populations , containing light ( control ) andheavy ( stimulated ) isotopesweremixedtogether . The resulting samples were maintained on ice and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer ( Wheaton , Millville , NJ ) . The homogenates werecentrifugedfor20minat40 , 000 × g at4 ◦ C . Supernatantswere collected , and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon . Once all solvent was evaporated , 40 (cid:2) L of methanol was added to the samples , vortexed for 1min , and submitted for mass spec - trometric analysis . LC – MS analysis was performed , injecting 15 (cid:2) L from each sample . E . A . Placzek et al . / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 53 ( 2010 ) 567 – 575 569 Fig . 1 . Synthetic scheme for the synthesis of 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine , modiﬁed from a published protocol by Lindberg and colleagues [ 25 ] . The metabolites into which the arachidonate backbone was incorporated were represented as doublets ( pairs of peaks corre - sponding to the light and heavy lipid isotopes ) in the LC / MS . The doublets were identiﬁed using XMASS , a software program capable of identifying doublets in LC / MS data [ 24 ] . All data were acquired in proﬁle mode , converted to centroid format , and transported to XMASSS in netCDF format . The results generated after XMASS processing provided a list of all chromatographic peaks whose spectra showed doublets that differed by 8 mass units , the ratio between the two isotopes , and the retention time for each species . Because the untreated RBL - 2H3 samples should contain nearly equal amounts of AEA and d 8 - AEA - derived species , we selected those doublets from the XMASS output ﬁles that contained isotopic ratios no greater than two . Using a lipid database , Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy ( Lipid MAPS , http : / / www . lipidmaps . org ) , preliminary identities for each doublet were assigned based upon the molecular weights provided in the output ﬁle . Searches were conducted using a mass range of ± 0 . 3amu . 2 . 3 . Synthesis of 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine Synthesis of 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( Fig . 1 ) was carried out with slight modiﬁcations from the pub - lished procedure [ 25 ] . To a stirred solution of ( S ) - glycidol ( Sigma , 670mg , 9 . 04mmol ) and ethyl N , N - diisopropylamine ( Sigma , 6 . 5mL , 9 . 5mmol ) in chloroform ( 20mL ) at 0 ◦ C under an argon atmosphere was added phosphorus oxychloride ( Sigma , 1 . 40g , 9 . 13mmol ) . After 2h , pyridine ( 2 . 0mL ) and choline tosylate ( Sigma , 2 . 89g , 10 . 5mmol ) were added , and the mixture was allowed to attain room temperature . After an additional 5h , water was added ( 0 . 50mL ) , and the stirring was continued for 1 more hour . Ethanol was added to the reaction mixture , resulting in a 70 % EtOH solution . Concentration and ﬂash chromatography ( 70 % EtOH ) provided ( R ) - glycidyl phosphocholine ( 550mg , 2 . 30mmol , 25 % ) . R f = 0 . 19 ( 70 % EtOH ) ; 1 H NMR was identical to that previ - ously published ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) [ 25 ] . Cesium carbonate ( 54mg ) was mixed with arachidonic acid ( 50mg ) in 2mL of DMF . ( R ) - glycidyl phosphocholine ( 20mg , 0 . 0821mmol ) was added to the cesium arachidonate mixture and stirred at 80 ◦ C . After 26h , the mixture was loaded onto a silica gel column and run with a methanol : H 2 O ( 5 : 1 ) solution to give an oily 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( 2mg , 0 . 0036mmol , 4 % ) , R f 0 . 29 ( MeOH / H 2 O 5 : 1 ) . 2 . 4 . Detection of AEA , 2 - AG , and 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine in mouse brain tissue Mouse brain samples were prepared for analysis of endo - cannabinoids using a protocol developed by Bradshaw and colleagues [ 26 ] . Tissue was immediately frozen at − 80 ◦ C upon sacriﬁcing , stored at − 80 ◦ C , allowed to thaw on ice for 1h , and weighed . Post - mortem changes in endocannabinoid levels have been well documented [ 27 , 28 ] . We performed stability experi - ments that revealed the 1h thaw on ice does not alter 2 - AG levels , but may result in ∼ 20 % loss of AEA ( data not shown ) . Twenty volumes of 1 : 1 mixture of cold methanol and acetonitrile were added to each tissue sample . The samples were maintained on ice and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer ( Kinematica ) . The homogenates were centrifuged for 20min at 40 , 000 × g at 4 ◦ C . Supernatants were collected and transferred to 15mL polypropy - lene centrifuge tubes . HPLC - grade water was added to each sample to create a 70 : 30 ( water : organic ) solution . A deuterated AEA stan - dard ( 100pmol in 15 (cid:2) L ) was added to each sample as an internal standard to track the recovery of the test compounds . Analytes were extracted from the supernatant using C18 solid - phase extrac - tion ( SPE ) columns ( Bond Elut 500mg , Varian ) . The SPE columns were conditioned with 2 . 5mL methanol and equilibrated with 2mL water , followed by sample loading . The SPE columns were then washed with 2mL water and 1 . 5mL 55 % methanol , followed by elution with 1mL methanol . Each eluate was dried , reconsti - tuted in 40 (cid:2) L methanol , and vortexed for 1min . LC – MS analysis was performed , injecting 15 (cid:2) L from each sample . Quantitation in brain samples was performed using standard curves , ranging from 0 . 014 to 1 . 4 (cid:2) M for AEA and 2 - AG , and 0 . 30 to 368 (cid:2) M for 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Coordination of silver cations to endocannabinoids improves detection capabilities by Q - TOF mass spectrometry In the present study , an LC – MS - based approach was devel - oped in order to investigate the endocannabinoid metabolome in addition to the two predominant endogenous compounds , AEA and 2 - AG . A Q - TOF mass spectrometer used in these experiments provided suitable levels of mass accuracy to make initial predic - tions of endocannabinoid metabolite identities based on molecular weights . We discovered that silver coordination to the arachido - nate backbones of AEA and 2 - AG [ 23 ] improved the detection of the Q - TOF mass spectrometer . Instead of quantifying compound levels using the [ M + H ] + peaks , the more prominent [ M + 107 Ag ] + and / or [ M + 109 Ag ] + ions were used to quantify the molecules of interest ( Fig . 2 ) . This method allowed us to quantify ( signal - to - noise > 10 ) AEA at a concentration of 1 . 44pmol / mL and 2 - AG at 2 . 1pmol / mL , representing an improvement in sensitivity of 30 - fold when com - pared to attempts without the inclusion of silver ion . Furthermore , the limit of detection could be extended to 15fmol on column for both species , values consistent with other published reports [ 23 , 29 ] . 570 E . A .

AEA and 2 - AG are detected in mouse brain tissue using the new argentation MS method Once the method using AEA and 2 - AG standards was devel - oped , quantiﬁcation of endocannabinoids in a biological context was pursued . The AEA and 2 - AG in mouse brain tissue was quanti - ﬁed ( Table1 ) andonaverage , 10 . 6pmol / gofAEAand1133 . 5pmol / g 2 - AG in whole mouse brains were estimated which are values consistent with the results of other studies [ 26 , 30 ] . Furthermore , the amount of 2 - AG found in brain tissue exceeds that of AEA by approximately150 - fold [ 31 – 33 ] . Ourresultsindicatedthatthecon - centration of 2 - AG in mouse brain was approximately 110 times higher than that of AEA . We did observe a minor peak ( < 20 % ) par - tiallyco - elutingwith2 - AG . Thisminorpeakisconsistentwith1 - AG thatismostlikelytheresultofinterconversionfrom2 - AG , thus , the results represent summed values for the 2 - AG and 1 - AG peaks . It should also be noted that the standard curves used for quantiﬁca - tion were not generated in the context of a biological matrix , so the absolute values should be viewed as relative concentrations . However , this limitation should not alter the interpretation of our results . These results establish that the silver ion enhancement for endocannabinoidionizationcombinedwiththeQ - TOFanalyzercan achieve equivalent results to those of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer . 3 . 3 . AEA - derived ARA is incorporated into a distinct pool of metabolites The stable isotope encoding approach was used to study AEA recycling and applied to the identiﬁcation of metabolite species containing the exogenous arachidonate backbone derived from Table 1 The levels of AEA , 2 - AG , and 2 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine in mouse brain as detected with LC – MS ( average ± S . D . ) . For AEA and 2 - AG n = 6 , for 2 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine n = 3 .

The technique of isotope encoding relies on the princi - ple that molecules with the same chemical structure , differing only in their isotopic composition , will be processed by cells in a sim - ilar manner and respond equally when analyzed simultaneously using a mass spectrometer . Metabolic labeling involves two pop - ulations of cultured cells treated with isotopically distinct species that are otherwise structurally identical . Both of the cell popula - tions , pre - labeled with light and heavy isotopes , are mixed in equal proportions . During the chromatographic analysis , both isotopes will elute with essentially the same retention time . However , in the mass spectrum a set of doublets will be produced . In these exper - iments , doublets are pairs of mass peaks that correspond to the light and heavy isotopes and differ from each other by eight mass units , i . e . the mass of the deuteriums that are present in the d 8 - AEA - coded sample , and share the same chromatographic retention time . RBL - 2H3 cells are a cognate mast cell line that has been success - fully used to study AEA uptake and biosynthesis [ 9 , 34 , 35 ] . The AEA metabolite pool was encoded with either the light - or deuterium - substituted arachidonate carbon chain using either 10 (cid:2) M AEA or d 8 - AEAtopre - labelcellsataconcentrationclosetotheapparent K m value for uptake in RBL - 2H3 cells and the K m for FAAH [ 36 ] . After the samples were mixed and mass analyzed , the output data ﬁle was formatted and processed by XMASS software to create a peak list . From the list of doublets , those pairs that had a ratio that was nogreaterthan2wereselected . Thedoubletsreportedrepresentan analysis of three separate experiments ; thus , the identiﬁed peaks were reproducible across all three experiments using the described criteria . Analysis of technical replicates in the doublet experiments suggests that the ratios for doublet peak intensities have a stan - dard deviation of 0 . 165 . Our approach may result in some false negatives , but minimizes false positives . The results were then also compared to the peaks generated from untreated cell samples whichprovidedabaselinelevelfortheobservedpeaks . Anydoublet appearingintheuntreatedcellsamplealonewasremovedfromthe XMASS output ﬁle and treated as a background doublet . The differ - ential isotope encoding method proved to be an effective means to compare the lipid population of metabolites between two samples simultaneously . This approach allowed us to discover a set of AEA - derivedarachidonate - containingmetabolitesthatweredetectedin ESI + mode ( Table 2 ) . Forty different lipid species were detected in E . A .

Stable isotope encoding experiments examining AEA - derived metabolites were performed in RBL - 2H3 cells as described in Section 2 . Using a lipid database Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy ( Lipid MAPS , http : / / www . lipidmaps . org ) , we determined a possible identity of doublets based on the molecular weight that was provided in the output ﬁle .

By applying the stable isotope encoding approach to compare the lipid metabolites that are produced from exogenous ARA to those from AEA - derived ARA , the classes of lipids involved in AEA recycling were found to be more diverse than those lipid metabo - lites derived from ARA . We hypothesized that cells utilize directed 572 E . A . Placzek et al . / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 53 ( 2010 ) 567 – 575 Fig . 3 .

In other words , the AEA - derived arachidonate carbon chain may be directed into a different pool of metabolites compared with exogenous ARA , or ARA derived from any other lipid . The doublets were identiﬁed that corresponded to the metabolites of exogenously applied ARA and d 8 - ARA . IncontrasttotheAEAmetabolites , whichcomprisedawide variety of lipid classes , the ARA metabolite pool detected in this assay was limited ( Supplemental Table 1 ) with the only class being identiﬁed as eicosanoids . 3 . 4 . 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine is a metabolite of AEA From the list of AEA metabolites that were identiﬁed using the LipidMAPS database , several species were of interest due to potential links to the endocannabinoid sys - tem . One of these molecules was a phosphocholine lipid , 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( Table 1 , 1 - ( 5Z , 8Z , 11Z , 14Z - eicosatetraenoyl ) - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ; Figs . 1 and 3 ) . The lipid structure was comprised of a phospho - cholinemoietycoupledtoanarachidonatecarbonchain . Toconﬁrm the identity of the 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine molecule as an AEA metabolite , 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine was synthesized as a standard ( Fig . 1 ) . The mass spectrometric properties of this molecule were analyzed . The structure was conﬁrmed by NMR ( Supplemental Fig . 1 ) and LC / MS / MS spectrometry ( Fig . 4B ) . Mass spectrometry was used to verify the molecular weight and retentiontimeofthedoubletobservedinourencodingexperiments ( Fig . 3 ) . The major peak for the 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine standard eluted at 8 . 02min , a retention time that matched the retention time of the proposed 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine that was selected from the list of doublets generated from isotope encoding experiments . Interest - ingly , the chromatogram for our synthesized standard showed two partially co - eluting peaks ( 7 . 78 and 8 . 02min ) ( Fig . 4B ) . MS / MS analysis of the two peaks in the standard revealed the same frag - mentation pattern but with differing ratios of the product ion intensities ( Fig . 4D and E ) . We believe the major peak ( 8 . 02min ) represents the expected sn - 1 regioisomer , but that the minor peak ( 7 . 78min ) represents a minor product corresponding to the sn - 2 compound . Finally , we examined if 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine occurs endogenously in the CNS . Whole mouse brain tissue was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine . The brain sam - ple showed a single predominant peak with some broadening that had a similar retention time ( 7 . 8min ) and m / z value as the synthesized standard ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Further conﬁrmation was obtained by generating a collisionally induced dissociation spectrum for the peak in the brain tissue . The relative intensi - ties of the product ions observed in the MS / MS analysis of the brain sample peak ( Fig . 4C ) supports identiﬁcation of the brain product as 2 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine , not 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( Fig . 4E ) . Using the same methods described above , the phosphocholine molecule was determined to be present in mouse brain tissue at 52 . 9nmol / g ( Table 1 ) . 4 . Discussion Novel endocannabinoid molecules and their metabolites are receiving attention due to their potential to regulate the classi - cal cannabinoid physiology . Detection of the complete family of endocannabinoid - related metabolites produced in vivo and char - acterization of enzymes involved with such biotransformations is crucial for the characterization of the endocannabinoid system , and may allow for identiﬁcation of other compounds that mod - ulate the signaling of both AEA and 2 - AG as well as their targets . We have previously demonstrated that RBL - 2H3 cells recycle the arachidonate chain derived from [ 3 H ] AEA into new AEA molecules [ 22 ] . In addition , AEA - derived 2 - AG synthesis and release was also observed in RBL - 2H3 cells in response to ionomycin [ 22 ] . There - fore , we concluded that the arachidonate chain derived from AEA may be recycled by cells to form new endocannabinoid molecules . Our previous ﬁndings suggest that the AEA - derived arachidonate chain may be trafﬁcked to and stored in speciﬁc regions of the cell , such as lipid raft microdomains [ 22 ] . Lipid raft microdomain organization may play a key role in endocannabinoid biosynthe - sis , because when these microdomains are disrupted , a decrease in endocannabinoid biosynthesis and release is observed [ 22 ] . Fur - thermore , RBL - 2H3 cells recycle exogenous [ 3 H ] ARA into new AEA and 2 - AG molecules in response to ionomycin [ 22 ] . Interestingly , AEA and 2 - AG synthesis is greater when the cells are pre - labeled E . A . Placzek et al . / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 53 ( 2010 ) 567 – 575 573 Fig . 4 .

Thedifference in relative ion intensities between panels ( D ) and ( E ) is attributed to the presence of sn - 2 product in the standard that has formed via acyl migration . with [ 3 H ] ARA compared to synthesis that is observed after [ 3 H ] AEA pre - labeling [ 22 ] . Overall , our results indicate that cells have distinct mechanisms for handling lipid metabolites . Therefore , dis - tinct pools of lipid metabolites may form depending on the source of the arachidonate chain and lipidomic proﬁling methodologies were developed and exploited to test this hypothesis . Lipidomics or lipid proﬁling , a subclass of metabolomics , is a studyofthelipidcomplementofacell , tissue , ororganism . Inrecent years , lipidomics has received increasing attention as a research tool in a range of diverse disciplines including physiology , lipid bio - chemistry , clinical biomarker discovery , and pathology [ 37 ] . The advancement of the ﬁeld has been driven by the development of analyticaltechnologies , andinparticularadvancesinLC – MS . Stable isotope encoding may be implemented as a tool to study lipidomics and in our case measure the dynamics of the endocannabinoid metabolite pools . As a general rule , stable isotope encoding strategies in concert with mass spectrometry can be used in the characterization of the molecular composition of protein , peptide , and lipid pools in vitro and in vivo . A common in vitro method of metabolic labeling involves feeding precursor metabolites to two populations of cul - tured cells that are labeled with isotopically distinct species that are otherwise structurally identical . At a deﬁned stage of sample preparation before the mass spectrometric analysis , the samples are mixed , thus , becoming enriched in both the light and heavy isotopes . The technique of isotope encoding relies on the princi - ple that molecules with the same chemical structure , differing only in their isotopic composition , will be processed by cells in a simi - lar manner and respond equally if analyzed simultaneously using a mass spectrometer . If both of the cell populations , pre - labeled with light and heavy isotopes , are mixed in equal proportions , then dur - ing analysis , a series of doublets should be produced on the mass spectra . Doublets refer to pairs of peaks that correspond to the light and heavy isotopes and differ from each other by the mass units associated with the isotopes used . Recent advances in the lipidomics ﬁeld in concert with our newly developed LC – MS method allowed the study of endo - cannabinoid biotransformations by analyzing a large spectrum of 574 E . A . Placzek et al . / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 53 ( 2010 ) 567 – 575 metabolites produced from AEA or ARA . We determined that lipids that are formed from AEA - derived arachidonate are different from non - AEA - derivedarachidonate . Usingtheargentationapproachwe discovered that ARA - derived metabolites were comprised of one main lipid class—eicosanoids , whereas AEA - derived arachidonate , in addition to eicosanoids , was metabolized into diradylglycerols , fatty acid amides , sterols , and glycerophospholipids . The arachi - donate chain is handled differently by the cell depending on the source of the lipid . This ﬁnding of differential metabolite handling may also explain why in the cellular model of endocannabinoid recycling , more AEA and 2 - AG were produced from [ 3 H ] ARA than from [ 3 H ] AEA [ 22 ] . If ARA is recycled by the cell into a small sub - set of metabolites , then the ARA - containing pool is not exhausted because of the abundance of precursors . Furthermore , the result that AEA is recycled into a different set of metabolites compared withARA , suggeststhatcellshaveaprecisemechanismfordirected trafﬁckingofmetabolitesthatdependsontheidentityandsourceof the parent compound . The hypothesis of directed trafﬁcking of AEA lends support to the notion of a speciﬁc uptake process that directs the endocannabinoids to a cellular compartment that contains the speciﬁc metabolic enzymes . Comparison of the metabolite peaks to peaks in unlabeled sam - ples provided an indication of the baseline levels of the identiﬁed compounds . For those peaks in our labeled samples that had a height equal to the corresponding peak in the unlabeled samples ( fatty acid amides , eicosanoids , phosphocholines , and diradylglyc - erols ) , we interpreted these as compounds that had rapid cellular turnover and were able to achieve steady - state levels over the course of the 24h labeling period . For those compounds whose labeled peaks were less than the control peak heights ( diradyl - glycerols and sterols ) , we suggest that the AEA treatment leads to altered cellular metabolic activity resulting in reduced levels in the labeled samples . One class of compounds , the fatty acid amides were found to have peak heights greater than those in the control samples . Because these compounds were all predicted to be fatty acid amides , we believe these compounds represent newly formed metabolites that may be the result of direct biotransformation of AEA itself by yet uncharacterized enzymes . From the list of lipids that we identiﬁed as potential AEA metabolites , one lipid in particular was of interest to us because of its potential link to other biologically relevant lipid signaling molecules . The lipid was identiﬁed as 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine via the LipidMAPS database . After synthesizing a standard , we conﬁrmed that the mass spectrometric prop - erties of 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine matched the molecular weight , retention time , and fragmentation pattern ( MS / MS ) of the lipid that was identiﬁed using the lipid isotope encoding approach . These results indicate that a pathway may exist from d 8 - AEA - derived arachidonate to 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine . Interestingly , our results are consistent with 2 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine being highly expressed endogenously in mouse brain tissue . If the sn - 1 regioi - somer is present in brain , it is a minor product as determined by comparison of the relative intensities of the product ions observed in the MS / MS analysis . Several questions still need to be addressed . For example , is the 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine molecule the metabolite of AEA or is the metabolite actually the sn - 2 regioisomer ? Also , can these acyl - phosphocholines serve as precursorsinthebiosynthesisoflipid - derivedsignalingmolecules ? Preliminary studies revealed that after treatment of RBL - 2H3 cells with ionomycin , an agent that stimulates endocannabinoid biosynthesis , the levels of the 1 - / or 2 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine increased compared to the untreated control ( not shown ) . We recognize the nonspeciﬁc nature of the ionomycin treatment and therefore suggest the relationship between the acyl - glycero - 3 - phosphocholineandotherlipidsignalingmolecules should be established in future studies using more speciﬁc approaches . Although the formation of arachidonate - containing diacyl phospholipid molecules is well documented , it is unclear how arachidonate - containing lysolipids are formed . As a general rule , a diacyl phospholipid carries a saturated fatty acid at the sn - 1 position , and the sn - 2 position is acylated with a partially unsatu - rated fatty acid ( such as arachidonic acid ) . The cellular biosynthetic mechanismfor1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholinefor - mationisunknown . Possiblemechanismscouldincludeproduction of 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine by cellular de novo synthesis or via a transacylation process allowing the attach - ment of an AEA - derived arachidonate moiety to pre - existing phospholipids . Arachidonate moieties are usually expected to occupy the sn - 2 position of a phospholipid , and the discovery here should stimulate the investigation whether an acyl rearrangement reactionisinvolvedintheproductionofthearachidonyl - containing glycerol phosphocholine molecules . 5 . Conclusions We exploited silver coordination to the arachidonate chains of AEA and ARA to signiﬁcantly improve sensitivity of the TOF mass analysis and achieve limits of detection and quantiﬁcation comparable to that of triple quadrupole instruments . Argentation , or the use of silver coordination to organic molecules for detec - tion improvement has been around since the 1930s . Winstein and Lucas were the ﬁrst group to quantitatively characterize the nature of the interaction between silver ions and compounds that con - tained ethylenic or acetylenic bonds [ 38 ] . Thirty years later , the argentation approach became popular for separations of lipophilic materials [ 39 ] . Kingsley and Marnett reported that the limit of detection for endocannabinoids may be improved on the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC – MS – MS ) instruments by exploiting silver cation coordination to the arachidonate backbone of these eicosanoid molecules [ 23 ] . The electrons within the par - tially ﬁlled d - orbitals of silver coordinate to the (cid:3) electrons in the double bonds within the arachidonate backbone of the neutral molecules , such as AEA and 2 - AG , resulting in an [ M + Ag ] + species that easily undergo conversion to the gas phase via an electro - spray ionization ( ESI ) source . The ease of analysis and speciﬁcity of the method makes this approach appealing for endocannabinoid quantiﬁcation in our experimental setting . The silver - mediated enhancement of detection using a Q - TOF instrument now enables the accuracy and high throughput capacity of the TOF instrument to be used as a discovery tool for endocannabinoid metabolites ( e . g . , 1 - O - arachidonyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ) . Such com - pound discovery efforts that require database searches , beneﬁt from the higher mass accuracy of the TOF instrument as compared to triple quadrupole instruments . Once compounds of interest are identiﬁed , subsequent analyses of biological samples would bene - ﬁt from the greater sensitivity of the triple quadrupole instrument . Together this approach could be used to identify and subse - quently quantify various lipids in biological samples under various conditions ( disease vs . normal , drug treated vs . untreated ) pro - viding important new information about biochemical and , in the case of the endocannabinoids , neurochemical changes that occur in vivo .
