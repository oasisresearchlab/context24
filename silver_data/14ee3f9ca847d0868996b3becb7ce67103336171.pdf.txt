The elastic free energy density along ﬁlaments is determined by their shape and mechanical properties , which were modeled in terms of bending , twisting , and twist - bend coupling elasticities . The elastic energy stored in ﬁlament deformation ( i . e . , strain ) tilts the fragmentation - annealing reaction free - energy proﬁle to favor fragmentation . The energy gradient introduces a local shear force that accelerates ﬁlament intersubunit bond rupture . The severing protein , coﬁlin , renders ﬁlaments more compliant in bending and twisting . As a result , ﬁlaments that are partially decorated with coﬁlin are mechanically heterogeneous ( i . e . , nonuni - form ) and display asymmetric shape deformations and energy proﬁles distinct from mechanically homogenous ( i . e . , uniform ) , bare actin , or saturated coﬁlactin ﬁlaments . The local buckling strain depends on the relative size of the compliant segment as well as the bending and twisting rigidities of ﬂanking regions . Filaments with a single bare / coﬁlin - decorated boundary localize energy and force adjacent to the boundary , within the compliant coﬁlactin segment . Filaments with small coﬁlin clusters were predicted to fragment within the compliant coﬁlactin rather than at boundaries . Neglecting contributions from twist - bend coupling elasticity underestimates the energy density and gradients along ﬁlaments , and thus the net effects of ﬁlament strain to fragmen - tation . Spatial conﬁnement causes compliant coﬁlactin segments and ﬁlaments to adopt higher deformation modes and store more elastic energy , thereby promoting fragmentation . The theory and simulations presented here establish a quantitative rela - tionship between actin ﬁlament fragmentation thermodynamics and elasticity , and reveal how local discontinuities in ﬁlament mechanical properties introduced by regulatory proteins can modulate both the severing efﬁciency and location along ﬁlaments . The emergent behavior of mechanically heterogeneous ﬁlaments , particularly under conﬁnement , emphasizes that severing in cells is likely to be inﬂuenced by multiple physical and chemical factors . INTRODUCTION Assembly of the cytoskeletal protein actin into linear ﬁla - ments and higher - order networks powers a variety of cell shape changes and movements , including leading - edge extension of migrating cells and cell division ( 1 , 2 ) . Persis - tent motility requires continuous actin reorganization , a pro - cess coordinated through dynamic interactions with numerous regulatory proteins . Among these are contractile myosin motor proteins that generate force and work along ﬁlaments , and severing proteins that fragment ﬁlaments and increase the concentration of ends available for subunit addition and loss . Members of the ADF / coﬁlin family of severing proteins ( herein , referred to as coﬁlin ) alter actin structure ( 3 , 4 ) and increase the ﬁlament bending and twisting compliance ( 5 ) . Filaments partially decorated with coﬁlin display frag - mentation more readily than bare or saturated ones ( 6 – 10 ) , and severing occurs preferentially at or near boundaries ( e . g . , junctions ) of bare and coﬁlin - decorated segments ( 5 , 8 , 11 ) . These observations have favored a model in which local topological and mechanical discontinuities render boundaries along partially decorated ﬁlaments susceptible to fragmentation ( 4 , 12 , 13 ) . Active forces generated by myosin motor proteins also fragment ﬁlaments and accelerate actin network turnover , both in vivo and in reconstituted biomimetic systems ( 14 – 21 ) . It has been postulated that severing and contractile pro - tein activities are coordinated in vivo , such that motor protein - driven deformations in ﬁlament shape enhance frag - mentation by coﬁlin severing proteins ( 12 , 16 , 17 ) . Lacking , as of this writing , are predictive metric studies of how such active shape deformations promote ﬁlament fragmen - tation , as well as how local heterogeneities in ﬁlament me - chanical properties introduced by coﬁlin occupancy inﬂuence the severing location and rate constant . Here , we establish a theoretical framework of actin ﬁla - ment deformation and fragmentation in response to external , compressive forces generated by contractile motor proteins . We employ numerical simulations to quantitate the spatial elastic energy and local shear force of homogenous ﬁla - ments ( e . g . , actin and coﬁlactin ) and ﬁlaments with Submitted December 18 , 2014 , and accepted for publication March 2 , 2015 . * Correspondence : enrique . delacruz @ yale . edu or jean - louis . martiel @ cea . fr Editor : David Odde .

We consider ﬁve ﬁlament classes : 1 ) native , bare actin ﬁlaments ; 2 ) coﬁlactin ﬁlaments ; 3 ) ﬁlaments with a single bare - and coﬁlin - deco - rated boundary ; and ﬁlaments with two boundaries , deﬁned by either 4 ) a single bare or 5 ) a coﬁlin - decorated segment , positioned at the ﬁlament center . Our approach and analysis provides a quantitative formalism between actin ﬁlament as - sembly thermodynamics and elasticity , and reveal how local alterations in mechanical properties introduced by coﬁlin occupancy can modulate both the severing efﬁciency and location along ﬁlaments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Theory and simulation In the forthcoming section we introduce the internal force density ( f ) and curvature strains ( k ) representing bending and twisting deformations at a ﬁlament position , the moment vector ( m ) , and Kirchhoff elastic free energy associated with ﬁlament bending and twisting strains . We develop a general model for the mechanical ( force and moment ) equilibrium of elastic ﬁla - ments subjected to external forces and torques ( General Equations for Mechanical Equilibrium of an Elastic Filament ) and use Euler parameters ( quaternions ) to derive a set of equations suitable for simulations ( Quater - nions ( Euler Parameters ) and Componentwise Form of Equations ) . We pre - sent the derivation of mechanical equilibrium conditions accounting for coupling of actin ﬁlament bending and twisting modes ( twist - bend coupling elasticity ( 22 ) ; see Fig . S1 in the Supporting Material ) . We provide the boundary conditions and external forces and torques applied to ﬁlaments ( Boundary Conditions , and Coﬁlin Density and Parameter Dependence on Space ) . We then adapt the equations to ﬁlaments displaying heterogene - ity and local discontinuities in mechanical properties ( i . e . , variable persis - tence length parameters ) that result from coﬁlin binding ( 5 , 8 , 9 , 23 – 26 ) ( Conﬁnement in Compliant Cylindrical Chamber ; see Fig . S2 ) . This was followed by Veriﬁcation of Numerical Simulations . General equations for mechanical equilibrium of an elastic ﬁlament We use the equations for elastic , inextensible rods ( 27 ) to simulate the conformations of individual actin ﬁlaments subjected to external buckling forces . At each point , the orientation of the ﬁlament cross - section is given by three unit , pairwise , orthogonal vectors ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) , called directors of the ﬁlament at position s . The internal force density , strain , and moment vectors ( f , k , m ) are deﬁned in the local coordinate system as f ¼ f 1 d 1 þ f 2 d 2 þ f 3 d 3 ( similar relations for the other vectors ) . The moment scales linearly with the curvature strain such that m ¼ B ( k (cid:2) k 0 ) , where k 0 is the resting ﬁlament strain . The ﬁrst two components of k 0 are zero ( i . e . , no bending at rest ) . The third component , k 30 , accounts for the intrinsic ﬁlament helicity . B is the bending rigidity matrix , which reads ( expressed in the local frame of directors ) as B ¼ 0 @ C B 0 C TB 0 C B C TB C TB C TB C T 1 A ; ( 1 ) where C B , C T , and C TB are the bending ( ﬂexural ) , twisting ( torsional ) , and the twist - bend coupling rigidity moduli , respectively ( note that rigidity moduli are just proportional to the persistence length times kT , with k as the Boltzmann constant and T as the temperature in Kelvin ) . Equation 1 as - sumes that bending rigidities are identical along d 1 and d 2 ( i . e . , bending stiffness is symmetrical and equal in all directions ) , and that twist - bend coupling is identical for both directors ( i . e . , the C TB term is identical for bending strains in the d 1 and d 2 directions ) . While this assumption may seem at variance with actin ﬁlament structure , which deviates locally from radial symmetry with a roughly elliptical cross - sectional area , the shape deformations evaluated here are on length - scales much greater than the ﬁlament helical repeat , so anisotropies arising from local , noncylindri - cal structure and associated elasticity will be averaged ( 11 , 24 , 28 ) . The elastic free energy density ( e ) within segment s is given by e ð s Þ ¼ 1 2 m , ð k (cid:2) k 0 Þ ¼ 1 2 (cid:2) C B ð k 1 (cid:2) k 10 Þ 2 þ C B ð k 2 (cid:2) k 20 Þ 2 þ C T ð k 3 (cid:2) k 30 Þ 2 þ 2 C TB ð k 3 (cid:2) k 30 Þð k 1 (cid:2) k 10 þ k 2 (cid:2) k 20 Þ (cid:3) : ( 2 ) Positivity of free energy density is ensured by the following condition : (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð C B C T Þ = 2 p < C TB < ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð C B C T Þ = 2 p : ( 3 ) In simulations , we use the normalized coupling rigidity q TB ¼ ð C TB ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p Þ = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ C B C T p ; such that (cid:2) 1 % q TB % 1 .

Using the deﬁnition of the moment , m ( s ) ¼ B ( s ) ( k (cid:2) k 0 ) , the second equation in Eq . 4 can be expanded to explicitly emphasize the spatial derivative of rigidities ( second term ) and resting strain k 0 ( third term ) : B v k v s þ v B v s ð k (cid:2) k 0 Þ (cid:2) B v k 0 v s þ k (cid:3) ð B ð k (cid:2) k 0 ÞÞ þ d 3 (cid:3) f ¼ m ext : ( 5 ) We use f ext ¼ 0 and m ext ¼ 0 in simulations . The unit tangent vector , de - noted d 3 , is given by d r ds ¼ d 3 ; ( 6 ) where r is a point along the ﬁlament . Because ﬁlaments move at low Reynolds number ( ~ 10 (cid:2) 5 , see Table 1 ) , we systematically eliminated from Eq . 4 all force and moment terms proportional to linear / angular acceleration .

Boundary conditions Solution of Eqs . 4 – 6 and 8 requires boundary conditions for the 13 variables of the system ( three for position , three for internal force , four for the Euler parameter , and three for bending strains ) . Because these variables come in pairs ( position / internal force and Euler parameter ( orientation ) / curvature strains ) ) , either the position / orientation or the force / curvature strains should be constrained . During buckling ( Fig . S3 ) , the end - to - end distance is progressively reduced by imposing the spatial position of both ﬁlament ends ( six vari - ables ) . The position of the barbed end is maintained at the origin while the other end is moved along the end - to - end axis in a stepwise manner . We deﬁne the position of ﬁlament ends as r ð 0 Þ ¼ r 0 ; r ð L Þ ¼ r 1 (cid:2) D s e ; ( 9 ) where r 0 ( respectively , r 1 ) is the position of the barbed end ( respectively , of the pointed end ) given by the initial conﬁguration ; L is the ﬁlament length ; D s is the buckling constraint ( the actual end - to - end distance is L (cid:2) D s ) ; and e is the unit vector along the end - to - end distance . The orientation at both ends is held constant during buckling , q ð 0 or L Þ ¼ q 0 ; L ; ( 10 ) where q 0 , L is a constant normalized quaternion . The normalization condi - tion for Euler parameters , q 21 þ q 22 þ q 23 þ q 24 ¼ 1 ; ( 11 ) holds at every position along the ﬁlament . Using Eq . 8 , it is sufﬁcient to impose this normalization at either one of the two ﬁlament ends . Hence , only three components of the quaternion are imposed at s ¼ L ( Eq . 10 ) , yielding the 13 conditions required to ﬁnd a solution to Eqs . 4 – 7 . Coﬁlin density and parameter dependence on space The bound coﬁlin density is denoted by d ( s ) , with 0 % d ( s ) % 1 ( d ¼ 0 : no coﬁlin ; d ¼ 1 : actin subunit with a bound coﬁlin ) . Transition from 0 ( no co - ﬁlin bound ) to 1 ( coﬁlin occupancy ) is given by ( Fig . S2 ) d ð s Þ ¼ (cid:5) 1 þ exp (cid:5) (cid:2) s (cid:2) s 0 d (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:2) 1 ; ( 12 ) where s 0 is the position of the transition ; the term d deﬁnes the transition steepness , given by the peak half - width D : D ð d Þ ¼ d ln 1 (cid:2) d þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 (cid:2) 2 d p 1 (cid:2) d (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 (cid:2) 2 d p ! z 2 d ln (cid:5) 2 d (cid:6) þ O (cid:2) d 2 (cid:3) : ( 13 ) Because the bending rigidity coefﬁcients ( see Table 1 and Fig . S2 ) depend on coﬁlin occupancy ( see Table 1 , deﬁnition of bending rigidity matrix Eq . 1 , and Fig . S2 ) , the actual rigidity is interpolated according to C B ð s Þ ¼ C B 1 ð 1 (cid:2) d ð s ÞÞ þ C B 2 d ð s Þ ; ( 14 ) with C B 1 ( respectively , C B 2 ) , the bending rigidity value in absence of coﬁlin ( respectively , in presence of coﬁlin ) . Similar relations hold for the torsional and twist - bend coupling rigidity coefﬁcients as well as any parameter that scales with coﬁlin occupancy . All simulations presented here were carried out with a d value of 10 nm . Conﬁnement in compliant cylindrical chamber Model ﬁlaments were conﬁned in a cylindrical chamber by constraining each point along the ﬁlament near the X axis during buckling with an applied force proportional to the lateral displacement of the ﬁlament in the ( Y , Z ) plane ( Fig .

Veriﬁcation of numerical simulations Numerical simulation outputs were veriﬁed by changing the step size along the ﬁlament using the MATLAB function bvp4c ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . This function solves boundary value problems and is well suited for the simulations carried out here . Our best choice for the step along the ﬁla - ment is 2 . 5 nm , which is much less than the transition width ( ~ 2 d ¼ 20 nm ) . To check the validity of our continuum approach , we simulated zero - width transition between pure actin and pure coﬁlactin segments using the MAT - LAB function bvp5c , which allows boundary points in the interval . At the internal boundary point we imposed the continuity of position ( six condi - tions ) and orientation ( eight conditions , but only seven conditions apply because of quaternion normalization ) ; no particular constraints are imposed upon the internal force and strain . No differences were found between the two approaches for all end - to - end distances and twist - bend coupling values considered in the article . Effects of ﬁlament deformation on the severing - fragmentation free energy proﬁle We model ﬁlament severing as a two - state , reversible equilibrium reaction between an intact and fragmented ﬁlament , with a single transition state . We consider two mechanisms by which the elastic free energy stored in the ﬁlament - shape deformation promotes severing . In the ﬁrst case , the elastic energy introduced by buckling destabilizes the intact ﬁlament ( i . e . , increases its energy ) , thereby lowering the transition state energy barrier height and facilitating ﬁlament breakage . In the second case , we treat the introduced elastic energy and its gradient along ﬁlaments as external work and force exerted on a ﬁlament subunit , respectively , analogous to sin - gle - molecule pulling - rupture experiments where applied loads modulate in - tersubunit bonds and intermolecular complex dissociation kinetics . First mechanism : activation over a free energy barrier Severing is modeled as a reversible , two - state transition between an intact and fragmented ﬁlament . We assume that the thermodynamic binding free - energy holding actin subunits together ( D G (cid:4)0 ) is modiﬁed by the elastic en - ergy associated with ﬁlament deformation ( D G (cid:4)0 Elastic ) , and therefore use the elastic energy terms ( Eq . 2 ) to model contributions of ﬁlament strain to the severing - fragmentation reaction free - energy proﬁle . We assume , as a ﬁrst approximation , that all of the stored elastic energy contributes to the reduction of the fragmentation free - energy barrier . In doing so , we neglect potential dissipation of elastic energy to subunit deformation and / or unfolding . Therefore , the calculated changes in fragmentation rates correspond to upper - limit estimates for the effects of ﬁlament deformation on intersubunit bond rupture . The total elastic free energy at position s , E ( s ) , is given by the sum of local bending ( E B ) , twisting ( E T ) and twist - bend coupling ( E TB ) elastic en - ergies ( Eq . 2 ) : E ð s Þ ¼ E B ð s Þ þ E T ð s Þ þ E TB ð s Þ : ( 15 ) For native conﬁgurations ( relaxed ﬁlaments ) , the severing rate ( k Sev ( Native ) ) is proportional to the intrinsic activation energy barrier height ( D G z 0 ) : k sev ð Native Þ f exp (cid:2) (cid:2) D G z0 (cid:7) kT (cid:3) : ( 16 ) Filament buckling introduces elastic energy ( D G (cid:4)0 Elastic ) to the ground state so that the activation energy of the strained conﬁguration ( D G z 0 Strained ) becomes D G z0 Strained ¼ D G z0 (cid:2) D G (cid:4) 0 Elastic : ( 17 ) Consequently , the stored elastic energy lowers the severing activation bar - rier height and accelerates severing . The strained conﬁguration rate con - stant is given by k sev ð Strained Þ f exp (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) D G z0 Strained (cid:3)(cid:7) kT (cid:3) f exp (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) D G z0 (cid:2) D G (cid:4) 0 Elastic (cid:3)(cid:7) kT (cid:3) f exp ð (cid:2) D G z0 (cid:7) kT (cid:3) exp (cid:2) D G (cid:4) 0 Elastic (cid:7) kT (cid:3) : ( 18 ) Combining Eqs . 16 and 17 yields the relative severing activity of strained and native ﬁlaments : k sev ð Strained Þ (cid:7) k sev ð Native Þ ¼ exp (cid:2) D G (cid:4) 0 Elastic (cid:7) kT (cid:3) : ( 19 ) The predicted severing ampliﬁcation factor follows the proﬁle of D G (cid:4)0 Elastic along the ﬁlament . Second mechanism : acceleration of ﬁlament segment disso - ciation by external force To interpret and estimate contributions of the local elastic energy gradient and resultant external force to severing , we assume 1 ) D G (cid:4)0 Elastic introduced by compressive buckling loads is equivalent to the work done by applied external loads , as in single molecule pulling experiments , and 2 ) ﬁlament severing is analogous to intermolecular interface bond rupture ( e . g . , ligand dissociation or unfolding ) , for which analytical expressions have been derived ( 30 ) . We adapted this theory of a single - well harmonic potential en - ergy surface ( Eq . 3 in Dudko et al . ( 30 ) ) to our simulations , and express the ratio of the spontaneous ( i . e . , intrinsic ) and loaded severing rates as k Sev ð Strained Þ k Sev ð Native Þ ¼ (cid:5) 1 (cid:2) 2 3 D G (cid:4) 0 elastic D G z0 (cid:6) 3 exp D G 0 Strained 1 (cid:2) (cid:5) 1 (cid:2) 2 3 D G (cid:4) 0 elastic D G z0 (cid:6) 32 ! ! ( 20 ) where k Sev ( Native ) is the spontaneous severing rate of bare actin ﬁlaments . The activation energy D G z 0 is given by the general form of the Eyring - Po - lanyi formula , k Sev ð Native Þ ¼ kT h exp (cid:5) (cid:2) D G z0 kT (cid:6) ; ( 21 ) using the experimentally determined values for spontaneous , bare actin ﬁla - ment severing ( k Sev ( Native ) ¼ 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 6 s (cid:2) 1 . subunit (cid:2) 1 , D G z 0 ¼ 43 . 27 kT ( 4 , 5 ) . Altering the shape of the free - energy surface from a harmonic to a cubic potential ( 30 , 31 ) yielded identical results . RESULTS Mechanically homogenous actin and coﬁlactin ﬁlaments Bare and coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlaments ( contour length ¼ 1 m m ) buckle symmetrically under ~ 0 . 5 – 2 pN compressive loads ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . These compressive forces are smaller than those generated by a single stroke of an individ - ual myosin motor protein ( ~ 5 pN ( 32 ) ) . However , the several 100 - nm reductions in ﬁlament end - to - end distance require multiple myosin stepping events . Biophysical Journal 108 ( 9 ) 2270 – 2281 Actin Filament Fragmentation 2273 The elastic energy stored in the ﬁlament conﬁguration de - pends on the end - to - end ﬁlament length and peaks at regions of highest curvature ( Fig . 1 ) . The resulting shear force given by the energy gradient displays local maxima at the mid - points of stored elastic energy , such that the net force dis - tributes equally at four distinct ﬁlament positions ( Fig . 1 ) . Coﬁlactin ﬁlaments , being more compliant ( Table 1 ) , buckle at lower loads and require less work to deform ( Fig . S5 ) , but store less energy and experience lower shear force than bare actin ﬁlaments at identical end - to - end lengths ( compare Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Partially decorated coﬁlactin ﬁlaments with mechanical heterogeneity Filaments that are partially decorated with coﬁlin are me - chanically heterogeneous and display shape deformations and energy proﬁles distinct from mechanically homogenous bare ( actin ) or saturated ( coﬁlactin ) ﬁlaments ( Fig . 1 ) . Fila - ments with a single bare and coﬁlin - decorated segment of equal length ( i . e . , with a single boundary at center ) buckle asymmetrically , with the compliant coﬁlactin segment de - forming more than the stiff , bare ﬁlament segment ( Fig . 1 C ) . This asymmetry introduces larger energy densities within the coﬁlactin segment and a maximal shear force adjacent to the boundary , within the compliant coﬁlactin segment ( Fig . 1 C ) . Filaments with two boundaries display two shear force peaks , with magnitudes that depend on the relative and spatial coﬁlin occupancy ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . A bare ﬁlament with a small cluster of bound coﬁlin ( cluster size in simula - tion is 0 . 05 m m , ~ 16 subunits ) stores an order - of - magnitude - more elastic energy and generates a 10 - fold - higher shear force than a coﬁlactin ﬁlament with a bare segment of equiv - alent size ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . Thus , all boundaries are not identical and the local buckling strain depends on the rela - tive size as well as the bending and twisting rigidities of ﬂanking regions . These simulations assume ﬁlament composition is con - stant and that bound coﬁlin does not redistribute within the buckling time . Coﬁlin dissociation occurs on a timescale of tens of seconds ( 11 , 33 ) . Nonmuscle myosins slide ﬁla - ments at ~ 170 – 340 nm . s (cid:2) 1 at near - physiological tempera - tures ( 30 (cid:4) C ( 34 ) ) , which corresponds to ~ 1 s timescale to achieve the reductions in ﬁlament end - to - end lengths considered here . Therefore , the buckling times are consider - ably shorter than the intrinsic coﬁlin redistribution times , justifying the use of a constant coﬁlin segment length in the calculations . Effects of buckling on ﬁlament severing Filament deformation ( i . e . , strain ) introduces elastic energy ( Eq . 20 ) and tilts the fragmentation - annealing reaction free - energy proﬁle ( Fig . 2 ) .

Filaments ( length 1 m m ) , with different actin / coﬁlactin conﬁgurations ( actin in red , coﬁlactin in green , illustrated above top panels ) are buckled by reduction of the end - to - end distance ( Fig .

The shape of the ﬁlament changes with buckling ( A – E , top row ) ; note that the asymmetric conﬁguration in ( C ) gives rise to asymmetric ﬁlament deformation .

For simplicity , we assume the transition state is not affected by strain . While this may not be an accurate assumption , it is a reason - able ﬁrst approximation given that ﬁlament fragmentation is accelerated by strain ( 14 , 18 , 20 , 40 ) . If ﬁlament strain increased the energy of the transition state equally or more than that of the ground state , loads would have no ef - fect or inhibit severing , respectively . Filament annealing is diffusion - limited ( 36 – 38 ) and weakly affected by coﬁlin oc - cupancy ( 4 ) . If ﬁlament annealing remains diffusion - limited for bent ﬁlaments , which to the best of our knowledge is not known , the severing - annealing equilibrium constant is load - dependent and buckling strain reduces the energy difference between intact and fragmented ﬁlaments , which shortens the population average ﬁlament length . Knowledge of the spatial ﬁlament elastic energy ( Fig . 1 ) allows us to 1 ) estimate the extent to which ﬁlament - shape deformations ( i . e . , changes in end - to - end distance , radius of curvature or kink angle ; relationship between these defor - mations is given in Fig . S6 ) accelerate fragmentation and 2 ) identify the most probable location of severing along strained ﬁlaments ( Fig . 3 ) . Assuming that ﬁlament severing results from rupture of one lateral and two longitudinal sub - unit contacts ( ( 41 ) ; Fig . S7 ) , and using values of (cid:2) 3 . 75 kT for lateral contacts and (cid:2) 12 . 15 kT for longitudinal contacts ( Fig . S7 ; Table 2 ; ( 22 , 41 ) ) , we estimate ﬁlament severing of ADP - actin ﬁlaments to be associated with (cid:2) 28 . 05 kT ( (cid:2) 16 . 61 kcal / mol ) of energy . Bare actin ﬁlaments buckled to 70 % of their contour lengths are predicted to fragment ( approximately ﬁvefold ) more rapidly than relaxed ﬁlaments ( Fig . 3 ) , in agreement with nanomanipulation experiments in which the ﬁlament radius of curvature is continually controlled ( 40 ) or short - ened with myosin motors ( 18 ) . Flexible coﬁlactin ﬁlaments at comparable end - to - end lengths are less susceptible to fragmentation than stiff , bare ﬁlaments , as reported in McCullough et al . ( 5 ) . Severing is enhanced at boundaries , although the contributions from ﬁlament strain are modest . Filaments with small coﬁlin clusters are more susceptible to fragmentation under strain ( Fig . 3 E ) than relaxed ﬁla - ments . The effect depends strongly on the size of the bound coﬁlin cluster . Filaments with small clusters accumulate more elastic energy , within the compliant coﬁlactin segment , than those with large clusters ( Figs . 3 E and S6 , top ) . Consequently , severing can be enhanced up to 1000 - fold relative to the intrinsic fragmentation - rate constant of bare actin ( Fig . 4 ) . This ampliﬁcation is highly nonlinear : an order - of - magnitude reduction in the cluster size yields a 100 - fold increase in the maximal severing rate constant ( Fig . 4 ) . This local increase in the microscopic severing - rate constant exceeds the overall severing rate across the ﬁlament ( i . e . , many sites along a 1 - m m ﬁlament that sever with a lower rate constant ) when the bound coﬁlin cluster size is < 0 . 04 m m . In other words , the local severing rate within the cluster exceeds the rate of severing elsewhere in the ﬁlament , accounting for potential severing sites , when the cluster is < 0 . 04 m m . We emphasize that these values represent lower estimates of acceleration , because boundaries between bare and coﬁ - lin - decorated segments fragment more readily than bare or coﬁlin - decorated ( 4 , 5 ) , analogous to the adhesive / interfacial fracture of nonprotein materials ( 4 , 9 , 12 ) . Role of twist - bend coupling elasticity Actin ﬁlament elasticity is dominated by three terms : bending ( E B ) , twisting ( E T ) , and coupling between twisting and bending ( E TB ( 22 ) ) . Twist - bend coupling has a short persistence length ( 22 ) and is typically considered a local phenomenon ( 42 ) or ignored when modeling ﬁlament me - chanical properties . However , twist - bend coupling causes bending strain in the ( d 1 , d 2 ) plane to generate rotation about the tangent direction along d 3 ( Figs . S1 and S2 ) . As a result , pure bending deformations introduce twisting de - formations and increase the shear stress about the tangent to centerline , as well as the total energy localization , thereby signiﬁcantly diminishing the energy barrier for severing . Accordingly , ﬁlaments modeled without twist - bend coupling elasticity underestimate the ﬁlament elastic energy and gradients associated with deformation ( Fig . 5 ) .

( B ) ( Red arrows ) Compressive forces applied at the two ﬁlament - ends during buckling . Note that considerable separation between the ground and transition states exists , even for strained ﬁlaments . Thus , the deformations are not irreversible ( e . g . , to rupture ) , but exist in a perturbative regime where fragmentation is likely to follow a nativelike pathway .

Conﬁnement forces compliant ﬁlaments and ﬁlament seg - ments to adopt higher deformation modes and thus store more elastic energy . The energy within a coﬁlactin cluster of conﬁned ﬁlaments is approximately twofold higher than for unconstrained ﬁlaments ( Fig . 5 E ) . Consequently , the predicted severing rate is considerably higher during conﬁnement than when allowed to bend freely . Contributions from viscous drag The ﬁlament end - to - end distance is reduced in a sequential stepwise manner during buckling . These stepping events correspond to myosin - driven contractile events in vivo , which are limited by ADP release kinetics of the motor ( 43 ) . To evaluate potential contributions of viscous drag to ﬁlament energy and fragmentation , we consider buckling events occurring at a velocity of 300 nm . s (cid:2) 1 , corresponding to buckling driven by double - headed nonmuscle myosin IIA or IIB ( sliding velocities of ~ 170 – 340 nm . s (cid:2) 1 at close to physiological temperatures ; 30 (cid:4) C ( 34 ) ) . These velocities and forthcoming contributions from viscous drag represent upper estimates , because picoNewton loads can have slow ADP release from myosin motors , and thus the ﬁlament sliding velocity ( 44 ) . The velocity of any point M along a buckling ﬁlament is approximated by V ¼ ð M ð t þ t Þ (cid:2) M ð t ÞÞ t ; ( 22 ) where ( t ) and ( t þ t ) refer to two successive ﬁlament conﬁg - urations separated by a single buckling step occurring within time t ( Fig . S10 ) . At any point M on the ﬁlament , the drag force per unit length ( force density ) is proportional to the point velocity according to F Drag ¼ (cid:2)ð C 1 V P þ C 2 V O Þ ; ( 23 ) where C 1 ( respectively , C 2 ) is the drag coefﬁcient per length ( in units of Pa . s ) associated with movement along the tangent at M ( respectively , movement orthogonal to the tangent at M ) . Therefore , the new ﬁlament conﬁguration r is given by the solution of Eq . 5 and a modiﬁed form of Eq . 4 , which reads v f v s þ k (cid:3) f ¼ C 1 (cid:5) r (cid:2) r 0 t (cid:6) Parallel þ C 2 (cid:5) r (cid:2) r 0 t (cid:6) Orthogonal ; ( 24 ) where r 0 is the known position of point M in the ﬁlament conﬁguration computed at the buckling previous step .

The enhancement of ﬁlament severing was calculated by considering the contri - butions from the local elastic energy ( Eq . 18 ; top row ) and the energy gradient representing an effective force ( Eq . 19 ; bottom row ) . The increase in the severing rate constant predicted from the spatial distribution of elastic energy , k sev ( Strained ) / k sev ( Native ) , coincides with that of D G (cid:4)0 Elastic ( top row ) . The distribution considering D G (cid:4)0 Elastic as the work done by a pulling force against a ﬁlament subunit yields comparable behavior . Note that both the activation energy barrier and force methods of analysis yield essentially identical results , with minor differences observed only in stiff actin ﬁlaments with a compliant coﬁlactin segment ( right column ) .

The coupling between the equations of force ( Eq . 23 ) and ﬁlament conﬁguration ( Eq . 6 ) is of importance in the numer - ical solution of equations . However , the viscous drag intro - duced by contractile protein - driven ﬁlament sliding velocities during buckling ( Fig . S10 , F – H ; Table 3 ) is negli - gible . Consequently , the contributions of viscous drag to ﬁlament severing are also expected to be negligible . Role of boundary conditions Boundary conditions control the ﬁlament - end orientations , the associated bending and twisting strains , the elastic en - ergy accumulation , and the severing probability . The simu - lations presented thus far constrain the orientation of both ﬁlament ends . To consider speciﬁc ﬁlament populations in cells that have free ( e . g . , by thermal ﬂuctuations ) or weakly constrained ends , such as those branching from dendritic networks , we compare the case where ﬁlament - end orienta - tion directors are held constant ( Fig . 1 ) with ﬁlaments that have only a single end constrained at s ¼ 0 , while bending vanishes at the other end ( three conditions ) : k ð s ¼ 0 ; L Þ ¼ k 0 ð s ¼ 0 ; L Þ : ( 25 ) We consider two different actin / coﬁlactin distributions , cor - responding either to a half - decorated ﬁlament ( composition 1 ) or to a stretch of coﬁlin ( size , 0 . 1 m m ) surrounded by bare actin segments ( composition 2 ) . Because conﬁguration 1 is asymmetric , we consider two cases , depending on whether the orientation is constrained at the bare ( left ; s ¼ 0 ) or co - ﬁlin - decorated ( right ; s ¼ L ) end of the ﬁlament . Relieving orientation constraints at one ﬁlament end lowers the accumulated elastic energy and the energy gradient ( Fig . 7 ) , because the elastic energy dissipates with reorientation of unconstrained ﬁlament ends . The extent of weakening in half - decorated ﬁlaments ( Fig . 7 , left ) depends on which end is free to reorient , such that a free bare actin end dissipates less energy than a free coﬁlac - tin end ( left column , compare blue and red curves ) . There - fore , the ﬁlament orientation and relative occupancy is likely a key factor in regulating fragmentation dynamics . DISCUSSION Accumulating experimental evidence , both in cells and in vitro , supports a role for myosin contractile protein - driven ﬁlament deformations in accelerating fragmentation and network reorganization ( 14 , 16 – 18 , 45 ) . Predictions made by the theory and simulations developed here compare quantitatively with experimental measurements of contrac - tile protein - driven ﬁlament severing events , and make addi - tional predictions that can be tested through future experiment . The proposed mechanism of contractile pro - tein - driven ﬁlament strain and severing would apply to the lamellipodium - lamellum junction , where both coﬁlin and myosin drive actin - network reorganization ( 16 , 45 ) . Shape deformations promote ﬁlament fragmentation Actin and coﬁlactin ﬁlaments deform symmetrically under low picoNewton compressive buckling forces ( Fig . 1 ) , mag - nitudes comparable to the forces generated by individual myosin motors ( 32 ) and growing ﬁlaments ( 46 ) . Filament buckling localizes elastic energy at regions of largest defor - mation and introduces a shear force ( i . e . , energy gradient ) at several foci along ﬁlaments ( Fig . 1 ) . Our analyses and results predict that buckling promotes bare actin ﬁlament fragmentation at curvature radii < 300 nm ( Fig . S8 ) as observed in reconstituted contractile actomyosin systems ( 18 ) . Similarly , the theory and simula - tions predict that ﬁlament fragmentation is enhanced at kink angles > 50 (cid:4) , as reported in McCullough et al . ( 5 ) . Coﬁlactin ﬁlament fragmentation requires larger deformations than bare actin ﬁlaments , consistent with direct visualization of actin and coﬁlactin ﬁlament severing events ( 5 ) . Mechanical heterogeneity introduced with coﬁlin occupancy can promote severing Filament shape deformations are predicted to enhance coﬁ - lin severing activity , lending credence to proposed in vivo severing mechanisms in which contractile and severing pro - teins coordinate to accelerate ﬁlament turnover ( 15 , 16 , 47 ) . Filaments partially decorated with coﬁlin deform asymmet - rically , with strain - energy and shear - force peaking adjacent to regions of mechanical discontinuities deﬁned by bound - aries of bare and coﬁlin - decorated segments .

Biophysical Journal 108 ( 9 ) 2270 – 2281 Actin Filament Fragmentation 2277 buckling promotes severing at boundaries within the compliant coﬁlactin segment , analogous to the manual snap - ping of uncooked asparagus . The enhanced compliance of coﬁlactin allows partially decorated ﬁlaments with large coﬁlin clusters ( e . g . , a single boundary or a small bare cluster ; Fig . 3 ) to tolerate larger deformations before fragmenting , as observed in wet - lab ex - periments ( 5 ) . In contrast , small bound coﬁlin clusters within a bare ﬁlament localize the majority of buckled ﬁla - ment strain energy ( Fig . 3 ) and are predicted to fragment within the coﬁlin cluster . Thus , ﬁlament severing efﬁciency and location depend on the composition and mechanical properties of regions ﬂanking the boundaries . This behavior implicates net coﬁlin occupancy , rather than just the bound - ary density , in regulating severing under compressive loads . Accordingly , strain - dependent coﬁlin occupancy ( 48 , 49 ) or dissociation through competition with regulatory proteins ( 9 ) can potentially introduce distinct boundary species with variable ﬂanking regions and thus modulate the overall severing efﬁciency . For example , preferential coﬁlin bind - ing to deformed ﬁlament segments would target strained ﬁl - aments for severing ( e . g . , Fig . 5 E ) . Such a mechanism would introduce an efﬁcient feedback response for locally and rapidly reorganizing strained ﬁlament networks . Factors contributing to ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin Multiple factors—structure , elasticity , deformation , and conﬁnement—contribute to the actin - ﬁlament - severing ac - tivity of coﬁlin . Structural discontinuities render boundaries between bare and coﬁlin - decorated segments more suscep - tible to fragmentation than continuous regions within bare or coﬁlin - decorated segments , analogous to adhesive / inter - face of nonprotein materials ( i . e . , boundaries are weak joints ( 4 – 7 , 12 , 13 ) .

Biophysical Journal 108 ( 9 ) 2270 – 2281 2278 De La Cruz et al . alterations in ﬁlament mechanical properties . Filament strain introduced by contractile motor proteins localizes elastic energy and locally enhances fragmentation at regions of greatest deformation . Coﬁlin - linked alterations in ﬁla - ment mechanics introduce an asymmetry in ﬁlaments that modulates the energy density and gradient along strained ﬁl - aments and the spatial probability of severing . Thus , discon - tinuities in both mechanics and structure can contribute to coﬁlin - dependent ﬁlament severing , with the latter presum - ably dominating thermally driven fragmentation events in the absence of active deformation and strain . The calculations carried out here consider the coupling between ﬁlament bending and twisting elasticities . Although this twist - bend coupling elasticity has a rather short persistence length ( < 0 . 2 m m ; Table 1 ) and dissipates over longer length scales , it makes signiﬁcant contributions to the total and local ﬁlament elastic energy density , energy gradient , and ﬁlament severing probability . Accordingly , elasticity models of actin ﬁlaments that ignore twist - bend coupling underestimate the elastic energy proﬁle and , pre - sumably , its consequences . Filaments with their end orientations constrained , as would occur with attachment to other ﬁlaments and cellular structures via cross - linking , branching , adaptor , and / or con - tractile proteins , store more elastic energy and are predicted to sever more readily than ﬁlaments with one or both ends free ( Fig . 7 ) . Similarly , restricting ﬁlament - bending ampli - tudes through conﬁnement within a chamber ( Fig . 6 ) or a cytoskeleton network ( 50 , 51 ) forces ﬁlaments to populate higher bending modes , as observed for microtubules ( 29 ) and intermediate ﬁlaments ( 52 ) , store more elastic energy , and sever with distinct probabilities and locations along ﬁl - aments . Thus , ﬁlaments constrained and conﬁned within networks are predicted to be more susceptible to strain - induced fragmentation than individual ﬁlaments with one or both ends free . Consistent with this behavior , cross - link - ing proteins inhibit ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin ( 53 ) but the ( coﬁlin ) - dependent severing rate , after considering contri - butions from reduced ﬁlament site accessibility , appears to be accelerated in some cases ( 54 ) .

Geometry for deformations in rods . Panel A . Resting configuration of a cylindrical rod with an ellipsoidal basis . Red , green and blue segments indicate the three , pair - wise orthogonal , unit vectors ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ) associated with ( 1 ) the main inertia axis of the rod cross section ( respectively , d 1 – red - for major axis and d 2 , - green - for the minor axis ) and with ( 2 ) the rod center line ( d 3 - blue - segment ) . Yellow stripes represent material lines located on the rod surface . The rod centerline is indicated in black . Panel B . Strained configurations of the resting rod corresponding , respectively , to bending about the d 1 axis ( panel B , left ) , twisting about the d 3 axis ( panel B , middle ) and bending - twisting ( panel B , right ) . The deformed yellow stripes materialize the deformation of the material in the rod under the corresponding strain . Panel C . Rotation of the orthogonal directions ( d 1 , d 2 , d 3 unit vectors ) corresponding to , respectively , bending ( left ) , twisting ( middle ) or twisting - bending strain ( right ) . Thin segments ( resp . thick segments ) give the unit directions at the rightmost rod end ( resp . leftmost end ) . Pure bending deformations ( panels B and C , left ) correspond to a rotation about the d 1 vector , which keeps its orientation unchanged along the rod centerline . Pure twisting deformations coincide with a rotation about the d 3 vector ( panels B and C , middle ) , which represent an invariant direction for twisting . The global rotation associated with twist and bending strains combines elementary rotations about the three possible directions ( panels B and C , right ) . 2 Figure S2 . ADF / cofilin spatial distribution and actin filament mechanical properties . Panel A . Typical distribution of ADF / cofilin bound to an actin filament for different values of the steepness parameter and s 0 = 0 . 5 µm . Panel B . Persistence lengths associated with filament bending ( red ) , twisting ( green ) and twist - bend coupling ( blue ) ; s 0 = 0 . 5 µm and δ = 0 . 01 µm . 3 Figure S3 . Buckling and boundary conditions . The position of filament end indicated by B is moved towards point A along the dashed line , as indicated by the red arrow . The end - to - end distance controls the buckling force exerted along the end - to - end axis and the amplitude of the loop . The orientation at both points A and B is constrained during the loading process . 4 Figure S4 . Simulation of filament confinement . The filament ( black curve , left panel ) is coerced into a cylindrical box by forces ( 1 ) along the M’M line ( right panel ) , ( 2 ) pointing towards the X - axis and increasing linearly with distance D . 5 Figure S5 . Relationship between filament end - to - end length and buckling force or work . Panel A . Color code corresponding to the various ( cofil ) actin filament types , as presented in Fig . 1A in the main text . Panel B . The total internal force along the filament centerline increases with the extent of buckling . Panel C . The work associated with filament compression is given by the sum of the tangential internal force time the shortening of the end - to - end distance during buckling : (cid:1) = ∑ (cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6) − (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:8) (cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:14) , where L is the filament length , L - ∆ is the final the end - to - end distance f the internal force function of the instantaneous end - to - end distance ( f is defined by Eq . 4 and in paragraph ( a ) of Methods ) ; e is the end - to - end distance reduction during filament compression , and de the reduction of the end - to - end distance during one step . Filaments comprised predominantly of flexible cofilactin segments ( green , orange and black curves ) require low forces ( < 1 pN ) to buckle over a distance that represents 30 % of the total length . Accordingly , the total compressive work is less than 40 k T ( green , orange and black curves in panel C ) and compares with the elastic energy ( panels B , C and D , Fig . 1 ) . Actin filaments ( red curve ) or filaments with a short cofilin - decorated section require larger force ( red and blue curves , panels B , C ) . 6 Figure S6 . Relationship between filament end - to - end length and kink angle or radius of curvature . Panel A . Color code corresponding to the various ( cofil ) actin filament types , as presented in Fig . 1A in the main text . The kink angle ( panel B ) and radius of curvature ( panel C ) is plotted against the end - to - end distance during buckling . The radius of curvature is given by where are the two first components of the filament strain vector κ . The kink angle is the angle between two unit tangents separated by 0 . 1 µm along the filament centerline . Note the green and red curves overlay and thus appear with alternating colors . 1 22 21 -   + k k ( ) 2 1 , k k 7 Figure S7 . Free energies of filament subunit interface contacts .

Binding reactions in panels A and B correspond , respectively , to reactions ( f ) and ( k ) in Fig . 2 of [ 43 ] . At 25 °C , 1 kcal . mol - 1 ( the unit used in [ 43 ] ) is equal to 1 . 688 kT . Panel C . Standard free energy change associated with filament severing . Calculations assume ( 1 ) that filament severing results from rupture of one lateral ( blue ) and two longitudinal ( red ) filament interfaces , and ( 2 ) that the total energy associated with filament fragmentation is equal to the sum of the three interface energies . 8 Figure S8 . Filament deformation - dependence of the maximal severing rate constant . The color code corresponds to cofilin distributions as in Fig . 1 ( panel A ) . All curves present the maximal severing rate constant values over the filament . The maximal severing rate constant and fragmentation free energy ( expressed as dissociation energy (cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:23)ǂ(cid:25) = (cid:15)(cid:16) ǂ(cid:25) − (cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:29)°(cid:25) ) scales with the magnitude of deformation : the end - to - end distance ( panels B and E ) , the minimal radius of curvature ( panels C and F ) and the maximal kink angle ( panels D and G ) . The radius of curvature is given by , where are the two first components of the filament strain vector κ .
