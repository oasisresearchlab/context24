In this paper , we present simulation results obtained from the individual - based model , J UNE , for school opening after a prior vaccination campaign using an optimistic set of assumptions about vaccine efﬁcacy and the likelihood of prior - reinfection . We take a scenario - based approach to modelling potential interventions to assess relative changes rather than real - world forecasts . Speciﬁcally , we assess the effects of vaccinating those aged 16 - 17 , those aged 12 - 17 , and not vaccinating children at all relative to only vaccinating the adult population . Vaccinating children in the 12 - 15 age group would have had a signiﬁcant impact on the course of the epidemic , saving thousands of lives overall in these simulations . In the absence of such a vaccination campaign our simulations show there could still be a signiﬁcant positive impact on the epidemic ( fewer cases , fewer deaths ) by continuing NPI strategies in schools . Our analysis suggests that the best results are likely derived from a combination of vaccinations and NPIs . 1 Introduction The spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , and associated variants of concern ( VOC ) , has caused signiﬁcant disruption to health care systems and over 4 . 5 million deaths recorded worldwide as of 1st September 2021 1 , with almost 120 , 000 of those in England alone 2 . To combat the spread of the virus , a multitude of non - pharmaceutical mitigation strategies have been used at different times , including isolation of cases and their contacts , the closure of meeting places such as leisure venues , and the encouraging of social distancing practices . Pharmaceutical interventions , e . g . vaccination programmes , play a central role in negating the impact of COVID - 19 . They signiﬁcantly reduce the likelihood of severe symptoms , hospitalisation and deaths from the original Coronavirus strain 3 – 5 and they are effective against more transmissible variants , including Delta 6 – 8 . Further studies 6 , 9 also suggest that vaccines reduce the risk of infection and transmission . The United Kingdom ( UK ) began its vaccination campaign on the 8th December 2020 , prioritising groups identiﬁed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ( JCVI ) , beginning with the older members of the population and those more vulnerable to severe response to the disease 10 . The protective beneﬁt of vaccination has been manifest : relaxation of restrictions in the UK has led to a signiﬁcant increase in overall case numbers , with the increase in hospital admissions and deaths much less severe 11 . Initially , vaccines were only offered to those over the age of 18 , however , from the 23rd August 2021 , the offer has been extended to those over 16 years old 12 . In contrast to strategies employed in other countries , younger age groups have so far not been included in the UK’s vaccination programme . This is due to the reduced impact of a COVID - 19 infection on children and the uncertainty around their role in transmission and , consequently , as drivers of overall infection rates . While schools present a potentially important transmission route given the facilitated mixing of large numbers of households , it has been conjectured that in comparison 1 .

Indeed , a meta - analysis 13 ﬁnds that in studies which speciﬁcally stratify by age , children under the age of 10 - 14 had 48 % lower odds of infection compared with those over the age of 20 14 . However , many of the clinical school studies in the UK and elsewhere were performed early in the pandemic outbreak , when testing was limited and asymptomatic cases missed , thereby reducing the signiﬁcance and ability to draw concrete conclusions 15 – 17 . Despite this uncertainty , one of the most commonly used non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) has been the closure of schools . Indeed , by early April 2020 , 188 countries , including the UK , had closed schools and more than 90 % of the world’s learners were affected 13 . To mitigate the risk of school transmission while schools were open , a range of measures have been used in the UK during the pandemic thus far . In particular , following school reopening in April 2021 , masks were required in secondary school classrooms , social distancing , regular testing , and a combination of bubbles , and sending home either close contacts of infected individuals or their entire bubble was used . As of September 2021 , these school based NPIs have been withdrawn with only regular testing and isolation of positive cases remaining . However , unlike the adult population , most children have not been vaccinated , with no approval yet to vaccine those under the age of 16 . With schools set to reopen in England in September 2021 , assessing the potential risks of reopening is crucial . Existing UK - based studies found a wide range of impacts of school opening in comparison to community transmission , ranging from signiﬁcant 18 , 19 to negligible 20 , with only the latter study assessing the impact of school reopening in 2021 explicitly and none assessing their reopening in the context of the Delta variant . In this paper we focus on the relative importance of vaccination and NPIs in schools on pandemic progression in England in September 2021 . We compare the inﬂuence of three different vaccination campaigns ( children in the 12 - 15 years old cohort , the 16 - 17 years old cohort , and only adults ) as well as the effects of continuing certain NPIs in schools . The inﬂuence of vaccination and the likelihood of re - infection use optimistic parameters as none of our scenarios are intended as actual forecasts , rather they are used to compare interventions . These scenarios are modelled with JUNE 21 , an individual - based model which uses ﬁne - grained geographic and demographic information and a strong focus on the details of policy interventions to describe the spread of infectious diseases . It simulates the movement of all the inhabitants of England ( ∼ 53 million individuals in our simulations ) in a geographically resolved representation of their interactions at home , school , work , and recreation 21 . Apart from the parameters we vary to assess these scenarios , model parameters were those ﬁtted using data from the ﬁrst wave in England . This ﬁtting allowed us to determine pre - pandemic contact intensity parameters , on top of which we could apply interventions , making the parameters still relevant for this study ( see original model paper 21 ) . We will brieﬂy introduce reference scenarios ( Section 2 ) and then present results in Section 3 . These are contextualised and discussed in Section 4 . The model and its parameters are detailed in Section 6 , with details of sensitivity studies in the Supplementary Notes . 2 Scenarios We use several scenarios to compare and contrast the impact of vaccination campaigns and NPIs . In these scenarios the Delta variant is assumed to be the dominant circulating virus , and some community NPIs are still in place , such as partial mask wearing and the isolation of positive cases ( see Section 6 ) . In all scenarios we assume that the vaccination campaigns were completed before the simulations began , which means none of these simulations are intended as forecasts , but rather to assess the relative effects of different interventions . Isolating vaccination in this way allows a cleaner comparison of possible interventions . The different vaccination scenarios are : • BASELINE : ≈ 80 % of adults are fully vaccinated ; • OLDER - TEENS : Vaccinating 80 % of those aged 16 - 17 alongside the BASELINE distribution of adult vaccinations ; • MOST - TEENS : Vaccinating 80 % of those aged 12 - 17 alongside the BASELINE distribution of adult vaccinations . • ALL - CHILDREN : Vaccinating 80 % of all children alongside the BASELINE distribution of adult vaccinations . Although scenarios involving vaccinating children do not match reality , the exercise here is to assess the counter - factual : what would have happened had these campaigns occurred before mid - summer ? We also assess the possible impact of NPIs in the school environment under two scenarios which are variations on the BASELINE : • CLASS - QUARANTINE : When a pupil develops symptoms , their whole classrooms stays at home for 10 days ; • SOCIAL - SCHOOLS : Variations in the intensity of contacts between individuals in schools to mimic the effect of policies such as mask wearing , social distancing and isolation between year groups . 2 / 19 .

The only change we make in the simulations at the beginning of September is to open schools and universities ( however , university opening has a minimal effect in our model , see Supplementary Note 4 ) . 3 Results In Figure 1 we show results for the impact of school openings under the assumption of no speciﬁc NPIs being in place in the school environment , and with different vaccination campaigns . 0 50000 100000 150000 200000 250000 # I n f ec t i o n s 0 50 100 150 200 # D e a t h s BASELINE OLDER - TEENS MOST - TEENS ALL - CHILDREN School Opening Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan2022 Feb 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 C u m u l a t i v e I n f ec t i o n s × 10 7 Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan2022 Feb 0 2500 5000 7500 10000 12500 C u m u l a t i v e D e a t h s Figure 1 . Number of new infections ( left ) and number of deaths ( right ) per day , daily ( upper ) and cumulative ( lower ) . We show four different scenarios in which ≈ 80 % of the eligible population is vaccinated : BASELINE - only those older than 18 ; OLDER - TEENS - those older than 16 are vaccinated ; MOST - TEENS - those older than 12 are vaccinated ; and ALL CHILDREN - the entire population is eligible . Shading shows an estimate of model parametric uncertainty ( discussed in Section 6 ) . In the left column , upper row , we show the total number of daily infections , including those cases that are not detected by testing . In the BASELINE and OLDER - TEENS scenarios we observe a signiﬁcant increase in daily infections , with a peak in the second half of September . Here , reopening schools results in a peak approximately a factor of four ( OLDER - TEENS ) to ﬁve ( BASELINE ) times larger compared to the time before school opening at the end of August . In the scenario where most teenagers are vaccinated ( MOST - TEENS ) , this peak in daily infections is delayed by about two weeks and less pronounced , and it is nearly entirely absent in the scenario where most children of all age groups are vaccinated ( ALL - CHILDREN ) . The increase in infections is also reﬂected in the number of daily deaths in the right column , upper row , which peaks about two weeks after the spikes in the daily infections as expected , and approximately follows the same pattern of relative increases . In the lower row we exhibit the cumulative numbers in total infections and deaths since summer . Our simulations suggest that a successful vaccination campaign for the 16 - 17 year old cohort reduces the total number of infections by approximately 2 million , and the total number of deaths by ∼ 1000 . This reduction is more signiﬁcant when vaccinating children over the age of 12 , which could have reduced the total number of infections by about a factor of two — 6 million instead of the 12 million observed in the BASELINE scenario — and it could have also drastically reduced the number of fatalities ( by approximately 5 , 000 ) . Of course , this positive outcome would have been even more pronounced in the highly unrealistic ALL - CHILDREN scenario , with no signiﬁcant impact of reopening schools on infection rates and fatalities . In Figure 2 we examine the impact of various NPIs in the school environment on the daily ( left column ) and cumulative ( right column ) number of deaths . In the upper row we show the impact of various levels of contact intensity reduction . In JUNE , this is represented as a multiplier on the intensity of social interactions in schools . A multiplier of 0 . 3 - 0 . 5 corresponds broadly to social distancing of 2 meters 22 – 24 , or the effect of mask wearing ( depending on the type of mask worn ) 22 – 27 . A 3 / 19 .

Bottom panels : ( re ) Introducing a quarantine policy ( classes sent home for 10 days if a pupil shows symptoms ) . Shading shows an estimate of model parametric uncertainty . combination of mask wearing and social distancing is estimated to be equivalent to a multiplier of 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 22 – 27 , while including increased ventilation can further reduce this to 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 22 – 29 . The literature used to estimate these values is varied , however , these are the values used as a guide as in similar works 30 . Clearly , reducing interaction intensity in schools through social distancing and other NPIs has a signiﬁcant impact on the number of fatalities , and has the potential to reduce them by up to ∼ 2 , 500 . In the lower row of Figure 2 we see the effects of the CLASS - QUARANTINE scenario in which school classes must quarantine in the event of a symptomatic case . This policy signiﬁcantly dampens the peak of the daily death curve , and the effect on the cumulative number of deaths ( ∼ 1 , 500 fewer deaths ) is signiﬁcant and close to the effect of having mask wearing and social distancing in schools . It can be anticipated that both measures taken together have the potential to reduce the overall death rate substantially . A naive expectation assumes that the increase in infection rates due to school reopening is concentrated in the lower age groups in which mortality rates are extremely low . However , the results of our simulations unambiguously translate infections into deaths , and similar relative gradient changes in the daily deaths and cumulative death curves are observed throughout . This suggests that the infections are rapidly breaking out of age strata , in line with ﬁndings from other studies 30 , and demonstrates that schools present an important route for disease transmission between households . This holds true even with a large proportion of vaccinated adults , and signiﬁcant increases in deaths may be observed . Using results from the simulations of the ﬁrst wave in spring and early summer 2020 , as well as those described here , we show ( Figure 3 , left ) that the age distribution of deaths in the BASELINE scenario is more skewed towards younger age groups than it was during the ﬁrst wave . Although overall signiﬁcantly more deaths occurred during the ﬁrst wave , asymmetries in the vaccination campaign by age group and the higher infection rates due to school reopening lead to an increased number of deaths among the younger population relative to the ﬁrst wave ( ∼ 600 younger than 40 , compared with ∼ 400 in the ﬁrst wave ) . Similarly ( Figure 3 , right ) , high infection rates translate into high levels of risk for the unvaccinated individuals by comparing the crude death fatality rates ( number of deaths by age group , divided by the size of the age group ) . In the BASELINE scenario unvaccinated people in the oldest age groups can be at almost 7 times more risk of death than a vaccinated person in their same age group . 4 Discussion We have presented results which simulate how the September - December 2021 Delta epidemic might have progressed in England in a number of scenarios . 4 / 19 .

On the left , we show the percentage of deaths in a given age group by the end of the simulations . We show a comparison between the BASELINE projections from August to February ( in blue ) , and JUNE’s results from the ﬁrst wave ( in green ) . On the right , we show Crude Fatality Rates ( CFR ) measured in JUNE by the end of the BASELINE simulations . We compare the resulting crude fatality rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated people , to that found during the ﬁrst wave . Error bars come from comparison using the full range of beta parameter samples ( see Section 6 ) . The primary result from our comparison of vaccine scenarios is that vaccinating MOST - TEENS prior to July 2021 would have had a major effect on the epidemic progression — signiﬁcantly more than just vaccinating those 16 and older or adults alone . It would have delayed the autumn peak , spread it out , and potentially resulted in thousands of lives saved . Given that any vaccination campaign for 12 - 15 years old cohort would have to happen after schools reopen , one might ask would it then be too late ? While we did not address that directly , examining a set of runs initialised with a lower percentage of a priori vaccinations in teenage cohorts suggests that the impact of fewer teenage vaccinations is an earlier and increased peak ( Supplementary Note 2 . 2 ) . If similar results were obtained by vaccinating teenagers later then in order to have an impact on the Delta wave , it is likely that starting a campaign to vaccinate most teenagers in September or later would need to be combined with other measures . As an alternative or supplement to vaccination , we investigate the impact of NPIs in schools . Speciﬁcally , we have investigate two different approaches : the effect of reducing contact intensity in schools , and the impact of quarantining entire classrooms in response to symptomatic infection of one or more pupils in that class . Our results suggest the best results are obtained by social distancing in schools combined with mask wearing and increased ventilation . Classroom quarantines were also found to be effective , comparable with the more stringent intensity reduction NPIs . In fact with enough reduction in school contact intensity , possibly also with the addition of class quarantining , the entire autumn wave is removed . There is a legitimate concern from our results when we apply such NPIs across all schools : It’s not obvious that such measures could or should be carried out in primary schools . It might be that the more extreme reductions in contact intensity are not achievable there , and so it may not be possible for the average contact intensity reduction to reach the values necessary to completely remove the autumn wave . We have investigated this ( Supplementary Note 5 ) where we found that a more signiﬁcant effort on reducing contact intensity in secondary schools ( β reduction factor = 0 . 2 in secondary schools only ) would correspond roughly to a less successful overall effort ( β reduction factor = 0 . 4 for all schools , Figure 1 ) . It is also possible , given the diverse opinions in the literature , that we have over - estimated the efﬁcacy of the achievable reductions in contact intensity . Regardless , our results suggest that an immediate imposition of at least the measures used in schools during early 2021 would be very beneﬁcial — particularly if accompanied by stringent attention to ventilation . Our scenarios are all perturbations from the BASELINE simulation . We do not attempt to simulate a scenario with combined interventions since there is a plethora of possible combinations . However , we expect the beneﬁt of combining vaccinations and school NPIs would be beneﬁcial in both the simulated and real world , not least since a combined programme would both mitigate against starting the vaccination programme late and an inability to fully reduce contact in all schools , whilst at the same time it would provide a long term solution for schools to function normally . Our scenarios differ from reality in several signiﬁcant ways but could still be relevant to policy both now and for future epidemics . Key points of distinction include : ( i ) Model structural uncertainty — how well the model represents how people are distributed and interact in England ; ( ii ) Model initialisation — how prior ( non - Delta ) infection and currently active ( Delta ) infection is distributed ; and ( iii ) Scenario uncertainty — - How well the scenarios represent possible realities .

For vaccination , the most important deviation from reality is that in all our scenarios all vaccinations were completed prior to the simulation starting 10th July . ( While the JUNE framework does offer a time - dependent implementation of vaccination distribution , it was not utilised in this study . ) In reality at this date only 64 % of the adult population was fully vaccinated , but by the end of August was nearer 80 % 31 . If our initial conditions were fully faithful to reality this difference would likely to lead to an underestimate in cases and deaths in comparison to data . We do see that in the ﬁrst few months of our simulations , but there are also a variety of other reasons why this might be ( see Supplementary Note 3 ) . Conversely , if we have under - estimated the prior prevalence of the virus then this would result in fewer deaths . We tested the sensitivity of our model to prior infections and found that , while that does indeed lower deaths in our simulation , the qualitative shape of the epidemic progression remains similar and we might expect our comparative results to remain similar . We do not attempt to correct the BASELINE scenario since ﬁxing this discrepancy might simply compensate for other issues with our initialisation and we do not claim that BASELINE is a forecast , simply that it represents a plausible reality . An additional source of uncertainty around our representation of Delta is how much more infective it is than wild - type Covid - 19 ( and the Alpha variant which infected many in the English wave - 2 ) ? We investigate our sensitivity to this parameter ( Figure S1 ) and ﬁnd that by the beginning of September most values of infectivity give similar qualitative and quantitative results . Importantly , all simulations show an increase in both infection and deaths due to schools re - opening . One ﬁnal issue to consider is the representation of the vaccines themselves . We investigated the impact of decreasing the sterilisation efﬁcacy from the values we use and found that took the simulated epidemic further into what seems like unrealistic territory during July and August . While it is still possible that the real sterilisation efﬁcacy is lower than the value we used ( since we cannot rule out the inﬂuence of other model compensating errors ) the value used leads to plausible results in our simulated world . Together our set of assumptions around infectivity , low susceptibility following prior infection with other variants , no re - infection following infection by Delta , and a time - dependent vaccine efﬁciency ( no waning immunity ) can be seen as conservative . Our sensitivity analysis suggests that these could also be thought of as optimistic , it is possible that these artiﬁcial scenarios could underestimate the progression of the real epidemic . In particular , should our assumptions around waning immunity and lack of re - infection by Delta be incorrect , the epidemic could not only be larger than simulated , it could last longer . However , even if so , we believe our conclusions around the relative impact of interventions would be robust . Ours is of course not the only modelling study addressing similar issues ; modelling studies focusing on the reopening of schools have been varied in their approaches and conclusions drawn . Keeling et al . used and age - structured compartmental model to assess the potential impact of school reopening in the UK mid - 2020 18 . Their ﬁndings suggest that reopening schools without any mitigation strategies in place would likely increase the reproduction number to above one . Similar results were found by Panovska - Grifﬁths et al . , who used the Covasim individual - based model 32 , and found that a second wave would likely be induced if schools were reopened in the UK alongside various other restriction relaxations 19 . The potential for negative consequences from school reopening have also been supported by similar studies conducted in other countries and settings 30 , 33 , 34 , as well as more abstract work assessing generic school settings under assumed mixing patterns 35 . Many of these works also explore possible mitigation measures such as partial school reopening , reducing classes size and increased testing , with most ﬁnding that opening earlier years is less dangerous than later years due to their reduced susceptibilities and fewer contacts . There are works which suggest that schools do not present such a danger . Courtemanche et al . found that while school closure in the United States ( US ) did make a positive difference to the epidemiological trajectory of the virus , their impact was much smaller than that of other measures 36 . Tatapundi et al . use an agent - based approach to assess the impact of partial and full school reopening in Florida , ﬁnding a less than 10 % increase in cases when fully reopened in their model 37 . Minimal simulated increases in the reproduction number due to school opening have also been found in studies from Norway 38 and Japan 39 . However , comparison of the resuse of NPIs in different countries suggest the same intervention in one country can have very different outcomes in others 40 . For the UK Sonabend et al . 20 use a compartmental transmission model 41 and include the effect of VOC and a sterilising vaccine to explore a range of scenarios for relaxing restrictions from the period June - August 2021 20 . They include school reopening in their model but ﬁnd that the large scale restriction relaxations have a dominating effect on increases in the reproduction number . Our work is most similar in methodology to that of Panovska - Grifﬁths et al . 19 , in assessing the most recent school reopening scenarios in the presence of various vaccination strategies . However , in comparison to theirs and other work ( including Sonabend et al . 20 ) , our model allows more comprehensive representation of school interactions including inter - and intra - year group mixing , dividing children into classes , and greater control over possible interventions . 6 / 19 .

Taking a scenario - based approach , we have highlighted the strong possibility that this induces a signiﬁcant peak in the number of daily infections , corresponding to a greater number of deaths . Through the use of vaccination programmes targeting young people , these negative epidemiological consequences may have been mitigated . Had the UK vaccinated most children over the age of 12 , our ﬁndings suggest that the impact of reopening schools could have been reduced by a factor of 2 , with vaccinating all children removing the risk of an autumn wave entirely . However , we also ﬁnd that vaccinating only those children aged 16 - 17 would have a relatively small effect . In addition , we explored a range of NPIs to help mitigate viral spread . Speciﬁcally we ﬁnd reducing contact intensity as much as possible ( such as combining mask wearing , social distancing , and increased ventilation in classrooms ) could limit the spread of the virus to the point where it would be indistinguishable from the case of vaccinating a large fraction of children . Correspondingly , less stringent measures , such as mask wearing or social distancing alone , will not be a efﬁcient in reducing the cumulative number of deaths . A careful analysis of model uncertainties was carried out , along with a and sensitivity analysis , to test the robustness of our overall results ; this analysis does not preclude the possibility that we could be under - estimating the progression of a real epidemic . While our simulations are not intended as forecasts , they suggest that the best outcome for England , in terms of cumulative deaths due to Delta during autumn 2021 , would occur if a vaccination programme was begun as soon as possible for children over the age of 12 and that a mixture of NPIs should be put in place in schools while that programme is rolled out . 6 Methods We use JUNE 21 , an agent - based modelling framework developed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases with a ﬁne - grained geographic and demographic resolution . In this study , we follow the setup presented in previous work 21 , although the framework is designed to be adaptable to other settings as well 30 . We simulate the movement of the 53 million inhabitants of England , and the spread of the disease in a geographically resolved representation of their interactions at home , school , work , and recreation . The ‘world’ in which the agents move ( where they work and live etc . ) uses census data from 2011 , and statistical representations of their distribution into geographically dispersed households , workplaces , schools etc . ( including , at appropriate times , transport units to explicitly model both local and long - distance commuting ) . The frequency and intensity of interactions is controlled by prescribed contact matrices and intensity parameters ( from now on β s ) , and infections are transmitted between individuals in contact using a representation of the infection agent ( in this case Delta ) and the susceptibility of those in contact with an infection person . Susceptibility is a function of age , vaccination status , and prior infection . In the remainder of this section we discuss how we represent the Delta variant , how the model was initialised , how we characterise model uncertainty , and how we implement the scenarios in this model ( and in particular how we represent policies and social distancing in schools ) . Together these each represent a key source of uncertainty in interpreting our results ( uncertainty is further discussed in Supplementary Note 3 ) . 6 . 1 Representing Delta The COVID - 19 variant B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta ) , which was ﬁrst detected in India , has overtaken the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) variant which previously dominated cases in the UK . There is now strong evidence suggesting higher transmissibility compared to that of the ﬁrst wave virus ( wild - type ) 42 . We represent variants in JUNE by introducing multiple different types of infection into the model and using a multiplicative factor for each type of transmission over wild - type . For these simulations we only use one infectious variant in the model , and make it twice as infective as wild - type . We have investigated other possible values of this multiplicative factor ( Supplementary Note 2 . 1 ) and conclude that this factor of two generates plausible levels of deaths and infection . Given that the probability for re - infection with a new variant is estimated to be low 43 , we assume that individuals previously infected by any COVID - 19 variant are only 2 % susceptible to any variant of the virus , compared to those that have not experienced a previous infection . We have investigated our sensitivity to this factor — not surprisingly Increasing susceptibility has the effect of increasing the scale of the epidemic but most of the effect is before school re - opening ( Figure S3 ) . We assume that vaccines can protect individuals through two independent mechanisms : ( i ) by reducing their susceptibility of being infected ; and ( ii ) by reducing their probability of developing a severe condition after infection . We implement ( i ) by immunising ( setting the individual’s susceptibility to 0 ) a percentage of the vaccinated population given by the vaccine efﬁcacy against infection , VE infection . Alternatively , we could have set the susceptibility of all vaccinated individuals to the value of VE infection . However , since a vaccinated individual will be exposed to the virus repeatedly , this deﬁnition would lead to a different inferred value of vaccine efﬁcacy by the end of the simulation . Our implementation is a heuristic that allows for direct comparison to studies on vaccine efﬁcacies . 7 / 19 .

Vaccine efﬁcacy values for different vaccines , taken from . We implement ( ii ) by dividing a person’s probability to develop severe symptoms by the vaccine efﬁcacy against symptoms , VE symptoms , therefore reducing the probability of death and hospitalisation by the same number . The values for vaccine efﬁcacy parameters are shown in Table 1 . Although there is also evidence that vaccines lose efﬁcacy against the Delta variant 6 – 8 , this seems mainly to arise from a fall in the sterilising efﬁcacy ( VE infection ) . We investigate the impact of changing this value in Supplementary Note 2 but ﬁnd the value we use provides the best agreement with reality . 6 . 2 Initial Conditions The primary concern in initialising these runs is to establish an appropriate distribution of prior infections , currently active infections , and prior vaccination ( according to the BASELINE scenario ) . By the beginning of the simulation we assume that 25 % of the population already had some variant of the virus 44 , 45 . We distribute these previous infections weighted by the number of positive cases observed by region and age ( Figure S6 ) . For current infection we randomly distribute 577 , 000 infections across the full population of England using estimates from the 10th July 2021 from the ONS Infection Survey 46 . These are also weighted by the distribution of cases by age and region during that week . Although our initialisation weights cases by age and region , it does not take into account the fact that infections grow in local clusters . However , within a few weeks , when millions are infected , the original distribution is likely not relevant to the results we present . All vaccinated individuals are assumed fully vaccinated ( i . e . we do not distinguish between single and double dosed ) before the simulations start . Vaccines are distributed according to age and location using ONS data 47 for the 10th of August , resulting in ≈ 80 % of the simulated adult population being vaccinated . Although three vaccines are being distributed in the UK , we only include vaccinations with AstraZeneca and Pﬁzer vaccines , since these dominate usage and are the main subjects of most prior studies 45 . We distribute vaccine types among the population according to their age using estimates from Scottish data 48 . The resulting distribution of total and AZ vaccinations by age are shown in Figure S7 . Throughout all simulations we assume that there is no waning immunity ( neither from vaccine or previous infection ) and that children aged between 0 and 12 are half as susceptible as adults of being infected 14 . Since these assumptions are shared among different scenarios , we still capture variations due to different group of the population not being vaccinated . 6 . 3 Model Uncertainty The model is deﬁned by 15 free parameters : 14 β parameters corresponding to the contact intensities in each location , and 1 parameter ( α p ) that models the relative intensity of physical contacts to non - physical contacts ( the original JUNE paper 21 provides a detailed explanation on how contacts in locations are parameterised ) . These parameters need to be ﬁtted against data on previous deaths and hospitalisations . We began by setting model parameters selected from an extensive exploration of the model’s 15 dimensional parameter space using latin hypercubes which were then reﬁned using Bayes linear emulation and history matching methodologies 49 – 51 following the original JUNE methodology 21 . The resulting sets of β parameters included many with plausible results , and so we sampled 8 well spaced parameter combinations from this plausible parameter region exploring the extremities of the region . Figure 4 shows a comparison of those 8 JUNE simulations to the observed daily death data . We treat the 8 sets of β parameters as estimates of the model parametric uncertainty and apply them in to the BASELINE , vaccination and NPI scenarios . With sensitivity experiments ( Supplementary Note 2 ) , we run in excess of 100 simulations Table S1 ) . It should be noted that the simulations already included have used 250 , 000 HPC core - hours and would have been responsible for about 2 , 500 kg of CO 2 emissions - equivalent to about 20 , 000km of ﬂying for one passenger 52 . ( Table S1 ) . 6 . 4 Policies Policies are used to control interventions in JUNE and can parameterise changes in social behaviour , as well as the total or partial closure of certain venues ( such as schools over the holiday period , or leisure venues to mirror government policy ) . More details on the use and implementation of policies can be found in the original model paper 21 . Here we brieﬂy discuss the policies used across all scenarios . 8 / 19 .

Daily deaths produced by the selected 8 JUNE β sets compared to data . The dark shading region corresponds to a 3 - sigma error in the data . Both the data and the JUNE curves have been smoothed by averaging over a time period of 7 days . At the time of writing , quarantining / isolation policies are still in place in the UK and we assume they are for the duration of our scenarios . We assume that symptomatic individuals , and members of their household , quarantine in their homes with a compliance rate of 79 % based on ONS studies 53 . We only model COVID - 19 circulation and so all symptomatic individuals are positive cases by deﬁnition , and we do not currently account for the testing of asymptomatic positive cases . As of the 16th August , the government announced that fully vaccinated individuals do not have to quarantine if they live with someone who has tested positive but do not present symptoms 54 . This has also been implemented into the model such that this policy activates on this date . Severely symptomatic individuals are assumed to be too unwell to leave their homes and effectively quarantine in the model . There are still many individuals and organisations exercising caution beyond the required government regulations . Recent surveys suggest that 12 % of people are still avoiding going to work in person 55 , with 5 % on furlough 56 , and key workers still attending work as normal ( which make up 19 % of the working population 57 ) . Masks are still worn by many individuals and we assume that this is done in during commuting and going to grocery stores with a compliance level of 69 % derived from YouGov surveys 58 . These factors are all represented in the model and assumed to stay constant throughout the simulations . However we do vary one other parameter during the simulation : As OpenTable data 59 shows that more people are going to restaurants relative to 2019 data ( at the level of 20 - 30 % , we assume this to be the case up until the reopening of schools , after which these values are restored to pre - pandemic estimates . The β multipliers discussed in Section 3 can be used to implement NPIs such as social distancing and other contact intensity changes . We assume some residual degree of caution in the population in certain venues ranging from minimal distancing ( β multiplier of 0 . 9 ) to more regulated 1m + distancing ( β multiplier of 0 . 7 22 ) . These multipliers are implemented separately to those of the mask wearing policies . We assume minimal distancing in pubs , commuting units ( carriages ) , gyms and visiting other households . Some distancing is assumed in grocery stores , care homes , companies , universities and schools , with more enforced distancing in cinemas . A complete set of parameters is included in the code release . All venues are considered as open throughout the simulations , with the exception of schools , which open on the 2nd September , and universities , which open on the 28th September .

To mitigate computational cost , the sensitivity analysis is performed with a single set of β values , corresponding to run number 8 in Figure 3 . We refer to the vaccination scenarios that result from this set of betas and the parameters assumed in the main text as the“representative” ( REPR ) scenario , since it produces the closest results to the mean of all 8 simulations in all scenarios . 2 . 1 : Delta infectivity Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 0 100000 200000 Daily infections 10 - Jul 25 - Jul 10 - Aug 1 2 3 % people infected per week Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 0 100 200 300 Daily deaths BASELINE ( 2 . 0 ) Data Data 1 . 5 1 . 6 1 . 7 1 . 8 1 . 9 2 . 0 2 . 1 2 . 2 2 . 3 2 . 4 2 . 5 2 . 6 2 . 7 2 . 8 Delta / Wild - type infectivity Figure S1 . Comparison of different runs changing the infectivity of the Delta variant respect to the wild type . The infectivity is colour coded from light blue ( 1 . 5 ) to purple ( 2 . 8 ) , with our baseline seating at 2 . 0 . Left panel : Daily infections compared to cases reported 46 . Middle panel : Percentage of people respect to the total population infected each week during the months of July and August . The data corresponds to an ONS estimate 46 . Right panel : Daily deaths compared to the ones reported by PHE 2 . All daily data has been smoothed by averaging over a period of 7 days . The Delta variant is estimated to be ( 40 − 60 ) % more infectious than the Alpha variant 60 , which in turn is also estimated to be ( 40 − 70 ) % more infectious than the Wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 that circulated in England during the ﬁrst wave 61 . Consequently , we explore the sensitivity of our baseline scenario on the infectivity of the Delta variant by varying its value in the range 1 . 5 − 2 . 8 . In Figure S1 , we show 3 comparisons to 3 different data sources : ( i ) our simulated daily infections to reported ONS cases 46 , ( ii ) the % of people infected per week to the ONS modelled estimate 46 , and ( iii ) our resulting daily deaths to PHE data 2 . As we can see , no single value of the Delta infectivity is a good match to the three data sources . Apart from model uncertainty , these deviations are expected for two reasons : reported cases are a lower bound to the number of total infections , since not all of them are detected ( especially asymptomatic cases ) , and our model initialisation routine may not be representative of the amount of active infections at the beginning of the simulation so we expect small deviations especially in the deaths data where timings are more sensitive . Overall , the position of the peak after schools reopen is not very sensitive to the Delta infectivity , and we choose an infectivity value of 2 . 0 since it is a good compromise in the comparison to data . 2 . 2 : Children vaccination rates Here we study how the results of the OLDER - TEENS and MOST - TEENS scenarios change if we vaccinate a different percentage of children . The OLDER - TEENS scenario is mostly unaffected , since this scenario was similar to the BASELINE simulations . The results of the sensitivity study are plotted in Figure S2 . The MOST - TEENS scenario is sensitive to this parameter . A lower vaccination rate shifts the peak caused by school reopening to earlier dates , also reducing its magnitude . Nonetheless , the simulations with higher vaccination rates also have active infections for a longer period of time , so it is useful to compare the cumulative number of deaths between the various rates ( lower panels of Figure S2 ) . We observe that , in the MOST - TEENS scenario , doubling the vaccination rate from 40 % to 80 % only reduces the number of deaths by 25 % . These runs can also be used to shed light on the question as to whether or not a vaccination campaign for teenagers starting after school reopening would still be in time to have a signiﬁcant effect ? Provided enough teenagers could be vaccinated fast enough , and assuming one dose provided full coverage quickly so that the effect of a later campaign was analogous to the 60 % run , then there would be value in doing so . However , in order to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Delta wave , it is likely that starting a campaign to vaccinate most teenagers in September or later would need to be combined with other measures . 15 / 19 .

Effect on daily deaths of changing the percentage of vaccinated children in the scenarios where we vaccinate the older teens or most teens . 2 . 3 : Previous infection For the main text simulations we assumed that previously infected individuals have a susceptibility of 0 . 02 to be reinfected with any variant . Even though this assumption is likely reasonable 43 , we do not model immunity waning and so we also explore the sensitivity of the results in the amount of people with immunity caused by previous infection , and its corresponding susceptibility to reinfection . The results are show in Figure S3 , where we observe that despite the fact that the overall number of infections is sensitive to varying these parameters , the position of the daily deaths peak is not , so the time of highest pressure in medical facilities is the same in all scenarios . We have not yet explored the impact of re - infection by Delta , or of waning immunity from vaccination . We might expect either of those to prolong the epidemic through winter . Finally , we assess the sensitivity of our results to the percent of previously infected individuals . We vary the percentage of previously infected by age , shown in Figure S6 by − 5 % , + 5 % , + 10 % , in each age group . Although the overall number of deaths varies quantitatively , the effect of reopening schools is the same qualitatively across all variations .

Key points of distinction include : • Model structural uncertainty : how well the model represents how people are distributed and interact in England . • Model initialisation : how prior ( non - Delta ) infection and currently active ( Delta ) infection is distributed . • How well the scenarios represent possible realities . For the purposes of this work it is how the representation of community vaccination , social distancing and quarantine , and delta itself , map onto these sources of uncertainty that is most important . The issue of how well the scenarios represent the real world is covered in the interpretation that follows . For vaccination , the most important deviation from reality is that in all our scenarios all vaccinations were completed prior to the simulation starting 10th July . In reality at this date only 64 % of the adult population was fully vaccinated , but by the end of August was nearer 80 % 31 . If our initial conditions were fully faithful to reality this difference would likely to lead to an underestimate in cases and deaths in comparison to data . Figure S1 shows that this the case for the BASELINE scenario ( at least for the ONS data and deaths , if not daily case data ) regardless of how much more infective we make the Delta variant than wild - type . However the same ﬁgure shows that by late August ( the last available data ) while we are still underestimating cases , we are overestimating deaths . The most likely reason for this is that we have under - estimated the prevalence of prior infection and / or our statistical allocation of prior infection has not infected the right people . However there are many other factors that could play a role here : including the health index might be different to that of the ﬁrst wave ( e . g . due to delta variant itself and / or hospitals getting better waning immunity ; people’s behaviour could be changing in ways we have not represented etc . The hypothesis that we have under - estimate the prior prevalence can be investigated . Figure S3 shows the effect of increasing the percentage previously infected would indeed drop the numbers dying into the observed range , but it also shows that the qualitative shape of the epidemic is unchanged . We do not attempt to correct the BASELINE scenario since ﬁxing this discrepancy might simply compensate for other issues with our initialisation and we do not claim that BASELINE is a forecast , simply that it represents a plausible reality . The important message is that the simulations are qualitatively doing the right thing . A key source of uncertainty around our representation of Delta is how much more infective it is than wild - type Covid - 19 ( and the Alpha variant which infected many in the English wave - 2 ) ? We investigate our sensitivity to this parameter in Figure S1 . Our main conclusion is that the impact of uncertainty in this factor primarily manifests itself during the early part of the simulation following initialisation - primarily when we think we could have too many susceptible individuals ( too little prior infection ) . By the beginning of September most values of infectivity give similar qualitative and quantitative results . We have used a value of 2 . 0 ( Delta twice as infective as wild - type Covid - 19 ) as a good compromise to ﬁtting the available data . One ﬁnal issue to consider is the representation of the vaccines themselves . Figure S4 shows that decreasing the sterilisation efﬁcacy from the values we use takes the simulated epidemic further into what seems like unrealistic territory during July and August . While it is still possible that the real sterilisation efﬁcacy is lower than the value we used ( since we cannot rule out the inﬂuence of other model compensating errors ) the value used leads to plausible results in our simulated world .

Supplementary Note 5 : Schools It is widely believed that social distancing and masking behaviour differs between primary and secondary schools . We can investigate differences in behaviour between the two using JUNE by varying the reduction in contact intensity between the two types of schools We carried out one additional variant of the school social distancing scenario to investigate this , applying school social distancing only in secondary schools . This run indicates that a more signiﬁcant effort on reducing contact intensity in secondary schools ( β reduction factor = 0 . 2 in secondary schools only , Figure S5 ) would correspond roughly to a less successful overall effort ( β reduction factor = 0 . 4 for all schools , Figure 1 main text ) .
