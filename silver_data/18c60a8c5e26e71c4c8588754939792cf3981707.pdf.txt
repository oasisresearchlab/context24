However , the regulatory mechanism of EHD3 - containing tubular structures remains poorly understood . An in vitro liposome co - sedimentation assay revealed that EHD3 interacted with phosphatidic acid through its helical domain and this interaction induced liposomal tubulations . Additionally , inhibiting phosphatidic acid synthesis with diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor or lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase inhibitor signi ﬁ cantly reduced the number of EHD3 - containing tubules and impaired their traf ﬁ cking from early endosomes .

Introduction Early endosomes ( EEs ) are known as “ sorting stations ” that consist of vesicular and tubular domains , which are respectively destined to lysosomes for degradation and to the cell surface through an endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) [ 1 ] . The de - gradation pathway from EEs to multivesicular bodies / late endo - somes involves the formation of intraluminal vesicles into which membrane molecules are sorted for ef ﬁ cient degradation in lyso - somes [ 2 ] . By comparison , there are two different recycling path - ways from EEs to the plasma membrane ( PM ) . One involves direct recycling from EEs to PM ( fast recycling ) whereas the other is in - direct recycling through ERC ( slow recycling ) . The former uses vesicle transport , whereas the latter uses tubular intermediates that ef ﬁ ciently recycle back both lipid molecules and membrane proteins [ 3 ] . Eps15 homology domain - containing protein 3 ( EHD3 ) is a member of the EHD family and is a potential candidate for reg - ulating tubular intermediates at EEs . The EHD family includes four isoforms ; EHD1 localized on ERC , EHD2 localized on PM , and EHD3 and EHD4 localized on EEs [ 4 ] . EHD1 is the best - characterized isoform and regulates the transport from ERC to PM , the cargoes of which include MHC I , GLUT4 , and β 1 integrin [ 5 – 7 ] . EHD2 was recently reported to regulate caveolar dynamics at PM [ 8 , 9 ] . EHD3 is localized on EEs , and its depletion results in delayed recycling of internalized transferrin ( Tfn ) [ 10 ] . These EHD - associated functions could be regulated by their capability for membrane remodeling [ 11 ] . Membrane remodeling is dependent , at least in part , on pro - tein – lipid interactions and lipid metabolism . Protein – lipid inter - actions have been reported for many cytosolic proteins , including BARS , F - BARS , and ALPS motif - containing proteins [ 12 – 14 ] . Oli - gomerization of these proteins induces membrane deformation [ 15 ] . Lipid metabolism can alter the shape of lipids to cone - and inverted cone - like shapes [ 16 , 17 ] . To modify their speci ﬁ c mem - brane lipid compositions , cells regulate lipid - modifying enzymes [ 18 , 19 ] or transfer speci ﬁ c lipids from outer lea ﬂ ets utilizing Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / yexcr Experimental Cell Research http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . yexcr . 2016 . 02 . 011 0014 - 4827 / & 2016 Elsevier Inc .

Although various phospholipids have been reported to be as - sociated with intracellular membrane transport , recent studies showed that phosphatidic acid ( PA ) plays important roles for in - ducing membrane curvature [ 21 ] and is an essential component for various cellular activities , including cell motility , ruf ﬂ ing , phagocytosis , and macropinocytosis [ 22 ] . A recent study also showed that PA acts as a pH biosensor [ 23 ] . With an increased intracellular pH , PA acquires a negative charge and recruits PA binding proteins , which have positive charges [ 24 ] . To investigate the regulatory mechanism involved in mem - brane deformation at EEs , we investigated potential EHD3 - binding lipids and the pathways that generated these lipids . We found that EHD3 interacted with PA and induced membrane tubulation from PA - containing liposomes . Inhibiting PA synthesis with R59022 ( diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor ) or CI - 976 ( lysophosphatidic acyl - transferase inhibitor ) signi ﬁ cantly reduced the number of EHD3 - containing tubules in vivo and disrupted Tfn transport from EEs . These results indicate that PA is required for EHD3 - containing tubular structures and membrane transport from EEs . 2 . Material and methods 2 . 1 .

Phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidylcho - line ( PC ) , PA , phosphoinositides ( PIs ) , phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 ) P ] , and phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bispho - sphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] were purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate [ PtdIns ( 3 ) P ] , and rhodamine - PE were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . 2 . 2 . DNA construction Murine full - length EHD3 cDNA was obtained from the Amer - ican Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) . Mutations were introduced using QuickChange II XL ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) , according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , and se - quences were veri ﬁ ed by DNA sequencing . To obtain GST and GFP fusion constructs , cDNA inserts were subcloned in - frame into a pGEX6p ( GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , UK ) or a pEGFP - C1 ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) plasmid . 2 . 3 . Protein expression and puri ﬁ cation Recombinant proteins were obtained using bacterial expression systems . Plasmids encoding for GST , GST - EHD3 , or GST - EHD3 K327D were transformed in ArcticExress competent cells . Cell subcultures were incubated at 30 ° C for 5 h and were then equi - librated at 10 ° C . To induce protein expression , the cells were in - cubated with IPTG ( ﬁ nal concentration : 1 mM ) at 10 ° C overnight . Bacteria were then lysed in a buffer that contained 50 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 400 mM NaCl , 1 % TritonX - 100 , and a complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) by sonication , and debris was removed by centrifugation at 15 , 000 g at 4 ° C for 15 min . Proteins were bound using Glutathione Spin Columns ( Pierce , Indianapolis , IN ) at 4 ° C for approximately 16 h , washed ﬁ ve times with washing buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 400 mM NaCl ) , and eluted with elution buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 40 mM glutathione ) . The puri ﬁ ed proteins were concentrated and exchanged with buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) using Amicon Ultra centrifugal ﬁ lters ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . 2 . 4 . Liposome co - sedimentation assay Liposomes were prepared from 60 % PE , 20 % PC , and 20 % of the indicated phospholipids [ PC , PS , PA , PIs , PtdIns ( 3 ) P , PtdIns ( 4 ) P , or PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] . These lipid mixtures were dried under nitrogen gas , hydrated in liposome buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , and mixed by vortexing for 1 min . Proteins ( 3 – 5 μ g ) were incubated with 50 μ g of liposomes in 50 μ l of buffer at room temperature for 15 min and were then centrifuged at 20 , 000 g at 20 ° C for 30 min . After centrifugation , supernatants and pellets were separated and subjected to SDS - PAGE . Proteins were visua - lized using Coomassie blue , and gels were scanned and the in - tensity of individual band were obtained by an Odyssey CLx In - frared Imaging System ( LI - COR , Lincoln , NE ) . To calculate the cor - rect amount of bound protein , the intensity of pellets without li - posome was subtracted from that of pellets with liposome [ 25 ] . The percentage of the bound proteins was obtained by dividing the intensity of bound protein by that of total protein ( supernatant þ pellets ) . 2 . 5 . In vitro liposome tubulation assay An in vitro tubulation assay was performed as previously de - scribed [ 26 ] . Liposomes were prepared from 70 % PE , 5 % rhoda - mine - PE , 10 % PC , and 15 % indicated phospholipids ( PC , PS , or PA ) in 0 . 3 M sucrose by vortexing . Puri ﬁ ed proteins ( 3 μ g ) were in - cubated with liposomes ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ) in a buffer that consisted of 20 mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM MgCl 2 at room temperature for 15 min and were then observed under a ﬂ uores - cence microscope ( Axio Observer Z1 , Zeiss ) . 2 . 6 . Cell culture and establishing stable cells The cells were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin - streptomycin at 37 ° C under 5 % CO 2 . To establish stably expressing cells , GFP - EHD3 was introduced into the cells using Effectene ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) , according to the manufac - turer ' s instructions . Cells that stably expressed GFP - EHD3 were selected using geneticin ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) for 2 weeks . 2 . 7 . In vivo tubulation assay HeLa cells that stably expressed GFP - EHD3 were incubated in pre - warmed medium that contained each inhibitor at 37 ° C for 60 min and were ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min . The cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted using Prolong Gold with DAPI ( Invitrogen , Burlington , CA ) . Images were acquired using a ﬂ uorescence microscope and analyzed using the ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . 2 . 8 . Intracellular acidi ﬁ cation Intracellular acidi ﬁ cation was performed as previously de - scribed [ 27 ] . HeLa cells were incubated in Ringer ' s buffer ( 155 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Y .

The cells were processed as described in the section on “ in vivo tubulation assay ” . 2 . 9 . Transport assay and immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis HeLa cells were incubated using a medium that contained Alexa Flour 488 - Tfn and Alexa Flour 555 - EGF for 5 min . After li - gand internalization , the cells were washed with pre - warmed PBS and were incubated with pre - warmed medium . The cells were ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min , incubated in blocking / permeabilization buffer ( 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 in PBS ) for 30 min , and processed as previously described [ 28 ] . Fluorescence images were acquired using a con - focal microscope ( LSM 710 , Zeiss ) . Co - localization rates were de - termined using the ImageJ software . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . EHD3 binds to PA through its second helical domain We ﬁ rst investigated which phospholipids bind to EHD3 in vitro . EHD2 , another member of the EHD family , binds phosphoinositides ( PIs ) through its second helical domain and an EHD2 mutation of the second helical domain resulted in reduced binding to Folch liposomes in vitro and cytoplasmic localization in vivo [ 11 ] . Because EHD3 has both a conserved the second helical domain and a critical lysine residue ( Fig . 1A ) , we con ﬁ rmed the importance of the helical domain by expressing a lysine mutant , K327D , in HeLa cells . As shown in Fig . 1B , EHD3 wild - type ( WT ) localized on intracellular tubular structures , as previously reported [ 29 , 30 ] . In contrast , EHD3 K327D was localized in cytoplasm and without localizing to any membranous structures , which indicated that the helical domain of EHD3 was responsible for its localization . To examine the speci ﬁ city of lipid interactions , recombinant GST , GST - EHD3 WT , and GST - EHD3 K327D proteins were ex - pressed in Escherichia coli cells , puri ﬁ ed , and used for a liposome co - sedimentation assay . Liposomes consisting of different lipids were incubated with recombinant proteins , centrifuged , and sub - jected to SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1C ) . EHD3 WT exhibited signi ﬁ cant binding to liposomes that contained 20 % PS or other phospholi - pids . In contrast , GST - EHD3 K327D proteins exhibited signi ﬁ cantly reduced binding , particularly to PA - containing liposomes , al - though there were no signi ﬁ cant effects when other liposomes were used ( Fig . 1C and D ) . This interaction between EHD3 WT and PA was in a concentration dependent manner ( see Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . These results indicated that EHD3 bound to PA through its helical domain and that this interaction might be responsible for its intracellular localization . Fig . 2 . PA localized on EEs and co - localized with EHD3 . ( A ) HeLa cells were transfected with GFP - 2PABD plasmid , ﬁ xed , and stained with an anti - EEA1 antibody . The ﬂ uorescence intensities of GFP (cid:2) 2PABD ( green ) and EEA1 ( magenta ) along the white line were measured and indicated in the bottom panel . Scale bar ¼ 30 μ m . ( B ) HeLa cells were transfected with GFP - 2PABD plasmid ( green ) and a His - Xpress - EHD3 plasmid ( detected with an anti - Xpress antibody ; magenta ) . The ﬂ uorescence intensities along with white line were measured and indicated in the bottom panel . Scale bar ¼ 20 μ m . Y . Henmi et al . / Experimental Cell Research 342 ( 2016 ) 1 – 10 4 The total amount of intracellular PA is quite small , at approxi - mately 1 – 2 % of total cell lipids [ 31 ] . To our knowledge , there is no evidence that EEs contain PA . Thus , we investigated the in - tracellular localization of PA using a GFP - fused PA binding domain ( GFP - 2PABD ) , which was derived from yeast SNARE protein Spo20 ( residues 51 – 91 ) [ 22 ] . HeLa cells were transfected with GFP - 2PABD , ﬁ xed , and counterstained with an anti - EEA1 antibody , a marker of EEs . GFP - 2PABD was localized on both intracellular endosomal tubules and vesicle - like structures and was partially co - localized with EEA1 ( Fig . 2A ) . When GFP - 2PABD was expressed with His - EHD3 , signi ﬁ cant co - localization was observed on both EHD3 - positive tubules and vesicles ( Fig . 2B ) . These results showed that EEs contained a PA positive domain at a site different from EEA1 that speci ﬁ cally binds to PtdIns ( 3 ) P and sug - gested that PA was involved in the formation of EHD3 - containing tubules . 3 . 2 . PA is essential for EHD3 tubulation Next we investigated whether PA was suf ﬁ cient for inducing EHD3 - dependent tubule formation in vitro . Recombinant proteins were incubated with ﬂ uorescently - labeled liposomes , and their morphologies were observed under a ﬂ uorescence microscope . Liposomes that were incubated with GST or GST - EHD3 K327D proteins exhibited a vesicular morphology , and there were no signi ﬁ cant differences between PC - , PS - , and PA - containing lipo - somes ( Fig . 3A – E and G – I ) . However , when the GST - EHD3 WT proteins were incubated with PA - containing liposomes , membra - nous tubulation was observed ( Fig . 3F ) . Because no tubules were observed after incubating GST - EHD3 WT with PC - or PS - contain - ing liposomes ( Fig . 3D and E ) , PA had speci ﬁ cally induced EHD3 tubulation by directly interacting with the helical domain of EHD3 . These results suggested that PA has an essential role for inducing endosomal tubules that are used for transport from EEs . 3 . 3 . Inhibiting diacylglycerol kinase and lysophosphatidic acid acyl - transferase disrupts EHD3 - containing tubular structures Before assessing a possible role for PA in transport from EEs , we investigated whether a PA - generating pathway was critical for inducing EHD3 - containing tubules . Intracellular PA is generated by several lipid metabolic pathways , including diacylglycerol ( DAG ) conversion to PA by diacylglycerol kinase ( DGK ) , PC conversion to PA by phospholipase D ( PLD ) , lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) con - version to PA by lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase ( LPAAT ) , and PA conversion to LPA by phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) [ 32 , 34 ] ( Fig . 4A ) . We examined which pathway was required for EHD3 - containing tubular structures using several inhibitors ; R59022 for DGK [ 22 ] , FIPI for PLD [ 35 ] , CI - 976 for LPAAT [ 36 ] , and MAFP and BEL for PLA2 [ 37 ] . HeLa cells that stably expressed GFP - EHD3 proteins were treated with these inhibitors for 1 h , ﬁ xed , and observed for EHD3 - containing tubules . In control cells ( DMSO treated ) , EHD3 - containing tubules were clearly observed . In contrast , in cells that were treated with R59022 or CI - 976 , a few short tubular structures were observed with a cytosolic localization ( Fig . 4B ) . Quantitative analysis also indicated that R59022 or CI - 976 treatment signi ﬁ cantly reduced the lengths of these tubules as compared with those in control cells ( Fig . 4C ; DMSO : 5 . 21 7 2 . 31 μ m ; R59022 : 1 . 65 7 0 . 72 μ m ; CI - 976 : 1 . 69 7 0 . 74 μ m ; P o 0 . 001 ) . On the other hand , MAFP or BEL treatment signi ﬁ cantly increased the lengths of EHD3 - containing tubules . Considering with the signi ﬁ cant reduction of cellular PA by R59022 and CI - 976 ( see Supplementary Fig . S2 ) , both PA - generating pathways from DAG and LPA would be required for EHD3 - containing tubular structures . 3 . 4 . PA is essential for the recycling pathway from EEs Next we investigated whether PA was also required for trans - port from EEs , as a previous report showed that Tfn recycling from EEs was delayed because of reduced EHD3 expression [ 10 ] .

The lengths of GFP - EHD3 tubular structures were measured for approximately 100 tubules from 20 cells , and the results are expressed as means and S . Ds . Asterisks indicate p o 0 . 001 ( unpaired t test ) . Scale bar ¼ 30 μ m . Y . Henmi et al . / Experimental Cell Research 342 ( 2016 ) 1 – 10 6 EGF are generally used as tracers for the recycling and degradative pathways , respectively [ 38 ] . HeLa cells were ﬁ rst pre - incubated with inhibitors for 60 min , incubated with ﬂ uorescently - labeled ligands for 5 min , and ﬁ nally incubated with inhibitors but with - out ligands for 30 min . However , when using R59022 , this in - hibitor was included after ligand internalization , as pre - treatment with this inhibitor interfered with internalization ( data not shown ) . Tfn was co - localized with EGF at 5 min but not at 30 min in DMSO - treated control cells , which indicated that both these ligands were appropriately exported from EEs . In contrast , treat - ment with R59022 or CI - 976 ( but not other inhibitors ) resulted in signi ﬁ cant co - localization of these ligands on EEs , even at 30 min ( Fig . 5A , B , D , and E ) . Additionally , FIPI also signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the segregation between EGF and Tfn ( Fig . 5B ) . Similar results were observed for the co - localization of EEA1 with Tfn , which suggested that these three inhibitors , R59022 , CI - 976 , and FIPI , inhibited transport from EEs . Moreover , when intracellular PA was masked by overexpression of GFP - 2PABD , export of Tfn from EE was apparently delayed ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . These results indicate that PA is essential for recycling from EE . Interestingly , although FIPI blocked endosomal transport , EHD3 - containing tubules were not affected by treatment with FIPI . These differences in effects between FIPI and R59022 or CI - 976 are mentioned in the Discussion section . As shown in Fig . 5C and F , both R59022 and CI - 976 signi ﬁ cantly increased the co - localization rate of EHD3 and Tfn , suggesting that these treatments delayed the endosomal transport through the inhibition of the formation of EHD3 - containing tubules . Whereas , we could not signi ﬁ cant delay in EHD3 - siRNA cells ( Henmi et al . , submitted for publication ) , al - though others have reported an essential role in endosomal transport . This would be due to that other EHD isoforms com - pensate in EHD3 - depleted cells . 3 . 5 . EHD3 localization is regulated by intracellular pH We found that PA had an essential role in transport from EEs , probably through its interaction with EHD3 to induce membrane tubulation . A recent study showed that PA acts as an intracellular pH biosensor [ 23 ] . PA is approximately 90 % deprotonated by al - kalization , which might be necessary for interactions with posi - tively charged PA - binding proteins [ 24 ] . Thus , we investigated whether the cytosolic pH level affected EHD3 localization and intracellular transport . To acidify the intracellular environment , we used Ringer ' s buffer as a “ control ” and acetate Ringer ' s buffer as a “ low pH buffer ” [ 27 ] , and we con ﬁ rmed that the low pH buffer , but not the control buffer , reduced intracellular pH ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . HeLa cells that stably expressed GFP - EHD3 proteins were Fig . 5 . Effects of lipid metabolizing enzyme inhibitors on transport from EEs .

Henmi et al . / Experimental Cell Research 342 ( 2016 ) 1 – 10 7 incubated with the control or low pH buffer . As shown in Fig . 6A , treatment with the control buffer had no effect on EHD3 - con - taining tubules , whereas treatment with the low pH buffer re - sulted in signi ﬁ cantly fewer tubules and their cytosolic localization was increased . These effects were rescued using the control buffer . Further , treatment with the low pH buffer inhibited transport from EEs , and these effects were also rescued using the control buffer ( Fig . 6B and C ) . These results suggested that the intracellular pH level regulates both EHD3 - containing tubular structures and their transport from EEs by deprotonating PA .

First , EHD3 bound to PA and induced membrane tubulation in vitro . Second , two metabolic pathways for generating PA , from DAG by DGK and from LPA by LPAAT , were required for both EHD3 tubulation and transport from EEs . We discuss the signi ﬁ cance of these results , including possible regulation by the intracellular pH level . 4 . 1 . EHD3 speci ﬁ cally binds to PA and induces membrane tubulation Although EHD3 bound to several phospholipid - containing li - posomes , a signi ﬁ cant interaction through its second helical do - main was observed in only liposomes that contained PA in vitro ( Fig . 1C and D ) . The interaction between EHD proteins and PIs was analyzed , but these experiments did not contain other phospho - lipids , such as PA [ 39 ] . On the other hand , it was reported that the EH domain of EHD proteins is responsible for the interaction with PIs [ 40 , 41 ] . Thus , EHD proteins may interact with different phos - pholipids through distinct lipid interacting domains , such as he - lical domain and EH - domain . EHD2 , another member of the EHD family , binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and an EHD2 mutation ( F322A ) re - sults in its cytosolic distribution [ 11 ] . EHD2 localizes to PM through the interaction with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 42 ] and regulates ca - veolar dynamics [ 8 , 9 ] . Furthermore , recent study has revealed that EHD1 binds to PS on ERC , which is translocated by ATP8A1 [ 25 ] . Thus , a speci ﬁ c interaction between EHD and each phospholipid might contribute to determining its intracellular localization and the traf ﬁ cking pathway that is regulated by each isoform . We showed that intracellular PA was found on EEs and co - localized with EHD3 in vivo ( Fig . 2A ) and that an EHD3 mutant ( K327D ) that did not interact with PA lost its characteristic tubular endosomal localization ( Fig . 1B ) . Thus , the interaction of EHD3 with PA ap - pears to be necessary for EHD3 localization on EEs . Further , we showed that PA was suf ﬁ cient for inducing membrane deforma - tion by EHD3 in vitro ( Fig . 3F ) . This suggested that this interaction contributed to both the localization and membrane deformation induced by EHD3 . However , our strategy for identifying in - tracellular PA was limited as there was a possibility for non - spe - ci ﬁ c interactions with the PA probes . Further studies will be nee - ded to determine the role of PA on EEs , although it remains pos - sible that PA regulates the localization and membrane deformation induced by EHD3 . 4 . 2 . Two PA - generating pathways are required for EHD3 tubulation and transport from EEs R59022 ( DGK inhibitor ) and CI - 976 ( LPAAT inhibitor ) inhibited the tubular localization of EHD3 and transport from EEs . DGK has been implicated in several biological processes [ 43 ] . DGK pro - motes PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production through the activation of PtdInsP5K by PA [ 33 , 44 , 45 ] , and it also mediates the regeneration of PIs [ 43 ] . Because PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mediates several intracellular membrane traf ﬁ cking pathways , including endocytosis and the recycling pathway [ 46 , 47 ] , an indirect effect through PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , rather than a direct effect of PA , may have been induced after R59022 treatment . By comparison , CI - 976 induces membrane tu - bulation in the Golgi , ER , and endosomal compartments and in - hibits multiple steps involved in membrane transport , which suggests that LPAAT is involved in several pathways of intracellular traf ﬁ cking [ 36 ] . Recent studies showed that membrane tubulation associated with EHD1 and MICAL - L1 , which is localized on re - cycling endosomes , is inhibited by CI - 976 treatment [ 21 , 48 ] . These contradicting results could be explained by the size of tubules , as long and short tubules depend on LPA and PA , respectively [ 21 ] . In this context , DGK α regulates tubular recycling endosomes through the interaction with MICAL - L1 , which could form a complex with syndapin2 and EHD1 [ 49 ] . MICAL - L1 - containing tubules depend on the expression of EHD3 , but not of EHD1 , indicating that EHD1 ( and EHD4 ) primarily functions in membrane vesiculation and EHD3 functions in membrane tubulation [ 50 ] . Thus , it is possible that different mechanisms underlie the membrane recruitment of EHD1 and EHD3 . FIPI , a PLD inhibitor , inhibited transport from EEs but not EHD3 localization . Numerous studies have reported the essential role of PLD for membrane traf ﬁ cking [ 51 – 54 ] . As with DGK , PLD has also been implicated in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production [ 55 ] . In this regard , inhibition by FIPI might only inhibit PA , which is utilized for activating PI4P5K , but not for recruitment and / or membrane deformation by EHD3 . 4 . 3 . Regulating the interaction between EHD3 and PA A recent study showed that PA acts as a pH biosensor [ 23 ] . The pH - dependent protein – lipid regulation has been found in PM under the regulation of Nhe2 [ 56 ] . It is possible that a similar regulation mechanism also occurs on EEs , as NHE family members are localized on endocytic organelles [ 57 , 58 ] . We showed that intracellular acidi ﬁ cation interfered with both EHD3 - containing tubules and Tfn recycling . Although these experiments could not exclude that other effects interfered with intracellular traf ﬁ cking , such as other intracellular pH sensors like V - ATPase [ 59 ] , future experiments should reveal the underlying mechanism for the in - teraction between PA and membrane tubules .
