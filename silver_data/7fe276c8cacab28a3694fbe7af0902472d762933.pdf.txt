Despite its importance , little is known about how this clathrin structure is 14 organized to mediate endocytosis . We used live - cell and super - resolution microscopy 15 techniques to reveal the dynamic organization of this poorly understood clathrin 16 structure . We found that a subset of endocytic proteins only transiently appeared at 17 postsynaptic sites . In contrast , other proteins , including Eps15 , intersectin1L , and ꞵ2 - 18 adaptin , were persistently enriched and partitioned at the edge of the EZ . We found 19 that uncoupling the EZ from the synapse led to the loss of most of these components , 20 while disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or AP2 - membrane interactions did not alter EZ 21 positioning . We conclude that the EZ is a stable , highly organized molecular platform 22 where components are differentially recruited and positioned to orchestrate the 23 endocytosis of synaptic receptors . 24 25 running title : molecular organization of synaptic endocytic zone 26 2 27 INTRODUCTION 28 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the principal mechanism for the internalization of 29 membrane components , and is essential for cellular homeostasis , intercellular 30 signaling and nutrient uptake in mammalian cells ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; 31 McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Mettlen et al . , 2018 ) . This process involves the tightly - 32 controlled initiation and maturation of clathrin - coated pits that is mediated by the 33 sequential recruitment of clathrin , cargo and endocytic adaptor proteins ( Cocucci et 34 al . , 2012 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Apart from these well - characterized , small ( ~ 100 nm ) 35 and short - lived ( < 120 sec ) clathrin coats , numerous electron and ( live - cell ) light 36 microscopy studies have revealed that clathrin can assemble into a remarkably large 37 variety of membrane - attached structures ( Grove et al . , 2014 ; Heuser , 1980 ; Leyton - 38 Puig et al . , 2017 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ; Sanan and Anderson , 1991 ) . In fact , the 39 lifetime , size and morphology of clathrin assemblies at the membrane diverge 40 enormously between cell types and even within cells . Clathrin structures varying from 41 100 nm up to 1 µm with lifetimes ranging from seconds to tens of minutes have been 42 reported . The origins and functional relevance of this striking heterogeneity remain to 43 be elucidated . 44 This heterogeneity is particularly evident in neurons that contain a divergent 45 population of clathrin structures distributed over their immense and complex plasma 46 membrane . At postsynaptic sites , a clathrin - coated structure referred to as the 47 endocytic zone ( EZ ) is stably associated with the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) ( Blanpied 48 et al . , 2002 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ) , via a Shank - Homer1c - Dynamin3 interaction ( Lu et al . , 49 2007 ; Rosendale et al . , 2017 ) . Disrupting the PSD - EZ interaction severely affects 50 glutamate receptor levels at synapses . Particularly , the ionotropic AMPA - type 51 glutamate receptors ( Petrini et al . , 2009 ; Rosendale et al . , 2017 ) and metabotropic 52 3 glutamate receptors ( Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) have been found to undergo trafficking 53 mediated by the EZ , while transferrin receptors are not preferentially internalized near 54 the synapse ( Rosendale et al . , 2017 ) . It has been proposed that once internalized at 55 the EZ , glutamate receptors enter the local recycling mechanism , that retains 56 receptors in intracellular pools that can recycle back to the synaptic membrane in an 57 activity - dependent manner ( Park et al . , 2006 ) . Indeed , the local recycling of receptors 58 via the EZ is essential for synaptic plasticity as uncoupling the EZ from the PSD 59 depletes synaptic AMPA receptors and aborts activity - induced trafficking of receptors 60 to the synaptic membrane during long - term potentiation ( Lu et al . , 2007 ; Petrini et al . , 61 2009 ) . Importantly , disruptions in EZ structure and function have been associated with 62 the development of neuronal disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and 63 Parkinson’s disease ( Cortese et al . , 2016 ; Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) . 64 Despite the clear functional importance of the EZ for synaptic transmission and 65 plasticity in neurons , the molecular organization and how this organization contributes 66 to its function is poorly understood . In electron microscopy studies , clathrin - coated 67 structures have been observed within dendritic spines ( Petralia et al . , 2003 ; Tao - 68 Cheng et al . , 2011 ) at an approximate distance of 100 - 600 nm from the PSD , 69 coinciding with an enrichment of adaptor proteins such as dynamin2 and AP2 ( Rácz 70 et al . , 2004 ) . However , fundamental information on the spatial distribution and 71 dynamics of endocytic proteins relative to the EZ and how these proteins contribute to 72 EZ organization is missing . Here , we resolved the spatial and temporal organization 73 of clathrin - coated structures in dendrites and spines using live - cell imaging and super - 74 resolution microscopy . We found that the postsynaptic EZ contains a unique and 75 stable assembly of endocytic proteins , that is highly organized at the nanoscale level . 76 Based on these findings , we propose that the EZ is a highly distinct clathrin - coated 77 4 structure that operates as a preassembled platform for endocytosis of synaptic 78 components to sustain efficient synaptic transmission and plasticity . 79 80 RESULTS 81 Heterogenous morphology of clathrin - coated structures in dendrites 82 To visualize clathrin - coated structures in mature cultured hippocampal neurons 83 ( DIV16 - 21 ) , GFP - clathrin light - chain - A ( GFP - CLCa ) was co - transfected with 84 Homer1c - mCherry as a marker of excitatory synapses . We found a large variety of 85 clathrin - coated structures distributed throughout the entire neuron ( Figure 1A ) . In 86 dendrites , a high density of clathrin structures was found in the shaft and the majority 87 of dendritic spines contained a distinct EZ , defined as a clathrin puncta closely 88 associated with the PSD ( 75 ± 5 % ) , consistent with previous observations ( Blanpied 89 et al . , 2002 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ; Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) . Importantly , labelling endogenous 90 CLCa using a CRISPR / Cas9 - based approach ( Willems et al . , 2020 ) resulted in 91 comparable distribution of clathrin structures ( Supplement Figure 1A - C ) . To resolve 92 clathrin - coated structures in dendrites at high spatial resolution , we used stimulated 93 emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy , allowing quantitative analyses of clathrin 94 structure morphology ( Figure 1B ) . Notably , STED resolved individual structures at 95 much higher resolution than confocal , often resolving distinct substructures within 96 clathrin patches that appeared homogenous in confocal microscopy ( Figure 1C ) . 97 PSDs associated with more than one clathrin structure were also observed ( Figure 98 1B , C ) . We found that 59 ± 5 % of the PSDs were associated with one clathrin structure , 99 while 14 ± 2 % and 5 . 4 ± 0 . 8 % were associated with two or three clathrin structures , 100 respectively ( Figure 1C ) . 101 Next , we analyzed the morphology of dendritic clathrin structures and found a 102 large range of sizes from as small as 0 . 01 µm 2 up to 0 . 43 µm 2 ( Figure 1E , F ) . On 103 5 average , the area of PSD - associated clathrin structures was lower , albeit not 104 statistically different from the average area of clathrin structures found in the shaft 105 ( area clathrin structures in shaft : 0 . 045 ± 0 . 003 µm 2 , spine : 0 . 038 µm 2 ± 0 . 002 , P > 106 0 . 1 ) ( Figure 1F ) . However , the variability in sizes of clathrin structures in the shaft , was 107 much larger than in spines ( CV shaft : 1 . 3 ; spines : 0 . 84 ) , with larger structures 108 exclusively found in the shaft and not in spines ( Figure 1D , E ; range in width / length 109 shaft : 0 . 15 µm to 1 . 7 µm , spine : 0 . 084 µm to 0 . 78 µm ) . Indeed , large clathrin structures 110 were regularly observed in the shaft , approximately ~ 3 per 20 µm of dendrite ( data not 111 shown ) . Thus , dendrites contain a large variation of clathrin - marked structures , with 112 PSD - associated EZs being a distinct , homogenous sub - population of clathrin 113 structures in dendritic spines . 114 Studies in non - neuronal cells often classify clathrin structures as flat lattices 115 based on size and shape . Compared to small , circular clathrin structures , presumably 116 representing endocytic pits or intracellular vesicles , lattices are defined as large and 117 irregularly shaped clathrin structures ( Grove et al . , 2014 ; Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ; 118 Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . We generated scatterplots of the circularity and area of 119 individual dendritic clathrin structures to test if we could find a similar classification 120 ( Figure 1E ) . However , there was no correlation between size and circularity in dendritic 121 clathrin structures ( R2 = 0 . 006 ) . Also , we did not observe a clear differentiation in 122 clathrin structures using this approach , suggesting that clathrin - coated structures in 123 dendrites form a highly heterogeneous population that cannot be classified based on 124 these morphological parameters . Altogether , these data highlight the morphological 125 heterogeneity of clathrin - coated structures in neuronal dendrites 126 127 6 128 Figure 1 .

We first 142 investigated the dynamics of clathrin - coated structures on short time intervals by 143 imaging at 0 . 2 Hz for 5 minutes . To differentiate stationary from moving particles we 144 used a Fourier analysis - based filtering on kymographs ( Mangeol et al . , 2016 ) . The 145 dendritic shaft predominantly contained stationary clathrin - coated structures , however 146 smaller anterograde and retrograde moving puncta were also observed ( Figure 2A ) . 147 Interestingly , these fast - moving particles were small ( IQR : 0 . 013 – 0 . 065 µm 2 ) most 148 likely reflecting intracellular vesicle transport . Within the stationary pool in the shaft , 149 we observed a few distinct clathrin - coated structures . The two most frequently 150 observed structures were larger , high - intensity structures that either remained 151 fluorescently stable over the entire course of imaging ( CV fluorescence intensity = 152 0 . 09 , Figure 2B : upper panel ) , or showed large fluctuations in fluorescence intensity 153 ( CV = 0 . 16 , Figure 2B : lower panel ) , perhaps indicating a more dynamic structure . In 154 rare cases transient budding of clathrin from these structures was observed , 155 reminiscent of endocytic pit formation . 156 In spines , the EZ appeared much more stable than dendritic clathrin structures , 157 with little fluctuations in GFP - CLCa intensity ( CV : 0 . 02 , Figure 2C : upper panel ) . 158 Strikingly , we were able to pick up , what seemed to be the budding of individual 159 vesicles from the EZ ( Figure 2C , lower panel ) . On average , the fluctuations in intensity 160 of clathrin structures in shaft and spines were significantly different , with much lower 161 fluctuations found in spines ( shaft CV : 0 . 06 ± 0 . 004 , spine CV : 0 . 02 ± 0 . 001 , p < 0 . 001 ) 162 ( Figure 2D ) . Longer acquisitions of 20 minutes at 30 - second intervals showed that the 163 clathrin - coated structures in spines had a considerably higher average lifetime 164 8 compared to clathrin - coated structures in the shaft ( average lifetime spines : 10 ± 0 . 7 165 minutes , shaft : 6 . 0 ± 0 . 3 minutes , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 2E ) . Indeed , 68 . 1 ± 6 . 0 % of PSDs 166 remained associated with at least one clathrin structure that was present for the entire 167 20 minutes , confirming that the EZ is stably coupled to the PSD ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; 168 Lu et al . , 2007 ; Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast , in the dendritic shaft , only a small 169 fraction ( ~ 15 % ) of clathrin - coated structures was long - lived ( > 17 . 5 minutes ) and the 170 median lifetime of all events was ~ 2 . 5 minutes , indicating that the majority of clathrin 171 structures in the dendritic shaft are transient structures ( Figure 2E ) . 172 The relatively long lifetime and small fluctuations in intensity of clathrin at the 173 EZ might suggest a considerably lower turnover of clathrin at the EZ compared to shaft 174 structures . To determine the turnover of clathrin at stable dendritic structures we used 175 fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) of GFP - CLCa ( Figure 2F ) . A 176 relatively long baseline of two minutes was acquired to make sure that only stationary 177 structures would be included in the analysis . We determined that in stable shaft 178 structures GFP - CLCa recovered relatively fast ( tau : 13 . 0 min ) to 75 . 8 ± 10 % in 20 179 minutes ( Figure 2G , H ) , indicating a high level of clathrin exchange at these structures . 180 In contrast to the high turnover of stationary structures in the shaft , the EZ showed 181 relatively low levels of turnover ( tau : 36 . 2 min ) and total recovery ( 38 . 2 ± 5 . 2 % after 182 20 minutes ) ( Figure 2G , H ) , suggesting little exchange of clathrin at the EZ . Taken 183 together , these live - cell imaging experiments show that clathrin - coated structures in 184 the dendritic shaft are morphologically and dynamically highly diverse , and that the EZ 185 in dendritic spines contains a stable accumulation of clathrin that is very similar from 186 spine to spine , thereby differentiating itself from all other clathrin - coated structures . 187 9 188 Figure 2 .

Homer1c - mCherry and GFP - CLCa were co - 209 transfected as before and labelled with primary and secondary antibodies to perform 210 two - color dSTORM imaging and reconstruct high - density localization maps of the 211 distribution of clathrin molecules within the EZ and relative to the PSD ( Figure 3A ) . We 212 used DBScan to define clusters of Homer1c molecules , outlining the PSD and the 213 associated clathrin clusters , marking the EZ ( Figure 3B ) . We found that the centroid 214 of the EZ was generally located within 100 nm from the border of the PSD ( Figure 3C ) 215 with an average border - to - centroid distance from PSD to EZ of 10 . 6 ± 7 . 8 nm , 216 confirming that the EZ is closely linked to the PSD and well within a distance that can 217 be linked by scaffold proteins ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . 218 On average the area of the EZ was 35 . 0 ± 2 . 0 x10 3 nm 2 ( Figure 3E ) , and 224 . 6 219 ± 10 . 4 nm in length and 146 . 5 ± 5 . 2 nm in width ( Figure 3D ) . Moreover , the dimensions 220 ( length and width ) of individual structures were positively correlated ( R2 = 0 . 58 ) . 221 Interestingly , we often found that PSDs were associated with multiple clathrin 222 structures , similar as to what we observed with gSTED imaging ( Figure 1B , D ) . We 223 noted that two distinct populations could be observed based on morphological 224 characteristics and distinguished between the primary and secondary clathrin 225 structure based on size . The largest was classified as the primary structure and we 226 found that this structure most likely corresponds to the EZ , as these were also the 227 most closely linked to the PSD ( Supplement Figure 2A , B ) . The secondary , smaller 228 structures were between 50 and 100 nm in diameter ( Supplement Figure 2C ) , similar 229 11 to the reported size of endocytic vesicles ( Kirchhausen and Harrison , 1981 ; Pearse 230 and Crowther , 1987 ) . These smaller structures also appeared more circular and 231 further away from the PSD ( Supplement figure 2B , D ) , further suggesting that these 232 smaller secondary structures are endocytic vesicles that perhaps budded off from the 233 edge of the EZ . 234 235 236 237 Figure 3 .

( E ) Histogram of the area of the EZ 245 plotted as x10 3 nm 2 . ( C - E ) n = 107 . 246 247 12 Endocytic proteins are differentially retained at perisynaptic sites 248 Apart from clathrin , only a few other endocytic components have been suggested to 249 be part of the EZ . Among these proteins are synaptotagmin - 3 ( Awasthi et al . , 2018 ) , 250 PICK1 ( Maria Fiuza et al . , 2017 ) and CPG2 ( Cottrell et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , the 251 presence of dynamin2 and AP2 at the site of clathrin - coated pits in spines suggest 252 that these proteins could also be part of the EZ ( Rácz et al . , 2004 ) . However , it remains 253 unknown whether these and other endocytic proteins are stably accumulated at the 254 EZ , or whether these are perhaps transiently recruited only during endocytic events . 255 To begin to address this , we first determined the localization of 12 well - known 256 endocytic proteins using confocal microscopy and live - cell imaging . Among these 257 proteins are the well - known F - BAR and N - BAR proteins like FCHO1 , syndapin - 1 258 ( Sdp1 ) , syndapin - 2 ( Sdp2 ) and amphiphysin ( Amph ) , ꞵ 2 - adaptin , a subunit of the 259 membrane proteins AP2 , scission protein dynamin2 ( Dyn2 ) and other adaptor proteins 260 like Eps15 , PICALM , intersectin - 1 long ( Itsn1L ) and epsin - 2 ( Epsn2 ) . In addition , we 261 included HIP1R and CPG2 that can couple the endocytic machinery to the actin 262 cytoskeleton ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Loebrich et 263 al . , 2016 ; Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) . We found that most of these proteins localized at 264 perisynaptic sites in a punctate manner , similar to clathrin ( Figure 4B ) . Sdp1 , Sdp2 265 and Amph showed a more diffuse signal within the spine and dendritic shaft . For 266 Amph , clear puncta associated with the PSD could be detected occasionally , however 267 Sdp1 and Sdp2 did not seem to be enriched in distinct puncta and were not further 268 analyzed . In this experiment we found that 66 . 8 ± 6 . 9 % of PSDs was associated with 269 GFP - CLCa ( Figure 4A , C ) . We found that the fraction of PSDs associated with HIP1R , 270 ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Dyn2 , CPG2 , Eps15 , and Itsn1L was similar to the percentage of clathrin - 271 associated PSDs . In contrast , PICALM , Epsn2 , Amph and FCHO1 were less 272 13 frequently found in association with the PSD ( Figure 4B , C ) . Thus , HIP1R , ꞵ 2 - adaptin , 273 Dyn2 , CPG2 , Eps15 and Itsn1L appear associated with the PSD and could be intrinsic 274 components of the EZ . 275 Next , to test whether these endocytic proteins were stably associated with the 276 PSD we performed time - lapse experiments on neurons co - expressing Homer1c and 277 a fluorophore - tagged endocytic protein . Neurons were imaged for 10 minutes at 20 - 278 second time intervals . We found very distinct behaviors in the dynamics of endocytic 279 proteins . While some proteins only transiently occurred at perisynaptic sites ( e . g . , 280 FCHO1 ; Figure 5A ) , other proteins appeared stable over the entire duration of the 281 acquisition ( e . g . , CPG2 ; Figure 5B ) . Consistent with our previous observations in fixed 282 neurons ( Figure 4C ) , the percentage of PSDs associated with a clear endocytic protein 283 structure for the entire duration of the acquisition was high for HIP1R , ꞵ 2 - adaptin , 284 Dyn2 , CPG2 , Eps15 and Itsn1L , and much lower for PICALM , FCHO1 , Epsn2 and 285 Amph ( Figure 5C ) . From these live - cell acquisitions we determined the lifetime of 286 events where these proteins were enriched at perisynaptic sites . Interestingly , when 287 plotted as histograms , a clear bimodal distribution of lifetimes was observed ( Figure 288 5D ) . Endocytic proteins accumulated either briefly ( < 3 min ) or appeared persistent ( > 9 289 minutes ) at perisynaptic sites ( Figure 5D ) . These data also indicated that HIP1R , ꞵ 2 - 290 adaptin , Dyn2 , CPG2 , Eps15 and Itsn1L are stable components that are generally 291 long - lived ( Figure 5D ) . In contrast , the average lifetimes of FCHO1 ( 2 . 74 ± 1 . 7 min ) , 292 PICALM ( 1 . 73 ± 0 . 2 min ) , Epsn2 ( 3 . 00 . ± 0 . 2 min ) , and Amph ( 2 . 73 ± 1 . 7 min ) at 293 perisynaptic sites were significantly lower compared to the average lifetime of CLCa . 294 Notably , the lifetime of these short - lived events is comparable to the duration of 295 endocytic events ( ~ 2 minutes ) , suggesting that these proteins are transiently recruited 296 upon the induction of endocytosis . To determine the turnover of the long - lived 297 14 endocytic proteins at perisynaptic sites we performed FRAP experiments . Except for 298 CPG2 , all endocytic proteins showed considerably higher turnover than clathrin 299 ( percentage of recovery after 10 minutes CPG2 : 29 . 4 ± 3 . 7 % , HIP1R : 59 . 2 ± 5 . 2 % , 300 ꞵ 2 - adaptin : 56 . 7 ± 3 . 8 % , Eps15 : 88 . 1 ± 3 . 8 , Itsn1L : 93 . 9 ± 8 . 7 ) ( Figure 5E , Supplement 301 Figure 3A - F ) . Taken together , these experiments reveal that apart from clathrin , 302 HIP1R , ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Dyn2 , CPG2 , Eps15 , and Itsn1L are also integral components of 303 the perisynaptic EZ , while PICALM , FCHO1 , Epsn2 and Amph only appear transiently 304 at perisynaptic sites , perhaps to initiate or facilitate endocytosis . 305 306 15 307 Figure 4 .

Data plotted as mean ± SEM . 338 17 Endocytic proteins have distinct spatial organization relative to the clathrin 339 coat at the EZ 340 The presence of multiple endocytic adaptor proteins and their stable retention at 341 perisynaptic sites suggests that these proteins might be an integral part of the EZ . 342 First , we applied two - color gSTED on Halo - CLCa co - transfected with the stably 343 retained endocytic proteins fused to GFP and stained for endogenous Homer1b / c to 344 localize the PSD . We indeed found that Eps15 , Itsn1L , Dyn2 , ꞵ 2 - adaptin and HIP1R 345 all colocalize with clathrin next to the PSD ( Supplement Figure 4A - C ) . 346 Next , to dissect the spatial organization of endocytic proteins relative to the 347 clathrin structure at the EZ we used two - color SMLM . Halo - CLCa was co - transfected 348 with a GFP - tagged endocytic protein to efficiently label and acquire high - density 349 localization maps in two channels . Strikingly , we found that ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Eps15 , and 350 Itsn1L were often distributed in smaller patches around and sometimes within the EZ 351 marked by CLCa ( Figure 6A - C ) . HIP1R showed a more homogenous distribution and 352 often colocalized with the EZ entirely and even surrounding the EZ ( Figure 6D ) . Dyn2 353 showed an overall more homogenous distribution , similar to HIP1R ( Figure 6E ) . 354 However , we also found examples where Dyn2 localized in small clusters at the edge 355 of the EZ . To analyze these distributions quantitatively , we manually selected regions 356 around clathrin structures in dendritic spines for further analysis . We then used 357 DBScan to determine the outline of the EZ marked by CLCa . We first mapped the 358 absolute distance of localizations to the border of the EZ averaged over a population 359 of EZs and found that all the endocytic proteins analyzed here were preferentially 360 localized at the edge of the clathrin structure ( Figure 6F ) . However , since individual 361 EZs can vary in size , we next mapped the density of endocytic proteins in rings that 362 were set in size relative to the clathrin structure . For each EZ , we defined 8 incremental 363 18 rings that were scaled with proportion to the outline of the EZ and binned the density 364 of localizations within each of these rings ( Figure 6G ) . As expected , when plotting the 365 relative fraction of Halo - CLCa localization within the rings , we found that the density 366 of clathrin molecules was highest in the center ( 0 - 20 % ring ) , gradually decreased 367 towards the outer ring ( 80 - 100 % ) and dropped to close to zero in the rings surrounding 368 the EZ ( 100 - 160 % rings ) . In contrast , when we plotted the relative density of Homer1c 369 localizations relative to CLCa , we found a clear separation of these distributions 370 ( Supplement Figure 2E , F ) , further validating the analysis . When analyzing the 371 endocytic adaptor proteins relative to the EZ , we again found that the relative density 372 of Eps15 , ꞵ 2 - adaptin and Itsn1L peaked within the EZ , but close to the edge of the EZ 373 ( Figure 6G ) . The profiles of HIP1R and Dyn2 localizations ( Figure 6G ) showed less 374 clear peaks , indicating a more homogenous distribution of these proteins within the 375 EZ . 376 377 19 378 Figure 6 : Endocytic proteins have distinct spatial organization relative to the 379 clathrin structure marking the EZ 380 ( A - E ) High resolution example images of Halo - CLCa labelled with JF647 ( orange ) co - 381 expressed with endocytic proteins fused to GFP labelled with CF568 ( cyan ) .

The mechanisms that retain the EZ 391 at this particular position , however , are not fully understood . The EZ is coupled to the 392 PSD via Shank - Homer - Dyn3 interactions ( Lu et al . , 2007 ; Petrini et al . , 2009 ; 393 Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , we now identified several new EZ components 394 that can couple to the plasma membrane , e . g . , via AP2 , or the actin cytoskeleton , e . g . , 395 via CPG2 and HIP1R ( Loebrich et al . , 2016 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that 396 these modes of interaction could also contribute to the positioning of the EZ . To test 397 this , we interfered with several of these connections . First , we tested whether Shank 398 knockdown ( KD ) , which we showed previously uncouples the EZ from the PSD 399 ( Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) , also leads to the loss of these newly identified EZ 400 components ( Figure 7A , B ) . Indeed , we found that Shank - KD did not only reduce the 401 number of clathrin - positive PSDs as found before ( 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 relative to control ) , but 402 also reduced the association of the PSD with other endocytic proteins ( Figure 7B ) . We 403 found that Shank - KD significantly reduced Homer1c - Eps15 ( 0 . 63 ± 0 . 1 ) , Homer1c - 404 Itsn1L ( 0 . 6 ± 0 . 1 ) and Homer1c - ꞵ 2 - adaptin ( 0 . 55 ± 0 . 1 ) coupling compared to control 405 ( Figure 7B ) . Interestingly , HIP1R ( 0 . 89 ± 0 . 04 ) and Dyn2 ( 0 . 91 ± 0 . 1 ) were not 406 uncoupled from the PSD ( Figure 7B ) . Together , these findings show that PSD - EZ 407 coupling via Shank proteins is necessary for the integrity of the EZ . Next , to test if 408 other mechanisms contribute to EZ maintenance we tested whether alterations in actin 409 dynamics , membrane binding capacity or depleting specific EZ components would 410 lead to a reduction of EZs ( Figure 7C ) . Interestingly , we found that disrupting the 411 integrity of the actin cytoskeleton did not result in a clear reduction of the PSD - EZ 412 21 association . The actin depolymerization drug Latrunculin B slightly decreased the 413 PSD - EZ association ( 0 . 81 ± 0 . 1 ) , but this was not statistically significant . The Arp2 / 3 414 inhibitor CK - 666 ( 0 . 98 ± 0 . 1 ) also did not significantly alter PSD - EZ association ( Figure 415 7D , F ) , suggesting that disrupting actin dynamics does not disrupt positioning of the 416 EZ . Jasplakinolide , an F - actin stabilizing drug , resulted in significantly more PSD - EZ 417 association compared to control ( 1 . 27 ± 0 . 04 , p < 0 . 05 ) . To test specific EZ - actin 418 interactions , we assessed whether the binding of clathrin to HIP1R is necessary for 419 EZ maintenance . Overexpression of a clathrin - light chain mutant that is unable to bind 420 HIP1R ( GFP - CLCb - EED / QQN ) ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Poupon et al . , 2008 ) , did 421 not affect the localization of the EZ ( Figure 7E , F ) , further indicating that coupling to 422 the actin cytoskeleton is not a primary mechanism for maintaining the EZ . The third 423 mechanism that could allow the perisynaptic localization of the EZ involves 424 interactions with the plasma membrane . To address this , we overexpressed an 425 AP2m1 mutant that is unable to interact with PIP2 and was shown to hamper receptor 426 internalization ( Raman et al . , 2014 ) , but we found no change in the fraction of EZ - 427 positive PSDs ( 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 ) , suggesting that coupling to the membrane via AP2 does not 428 affect EZ maintenance ( Figure 7E , F ) . Lastly , we checked if removing a specific , stable 429 endocytic component , Itsn1L would affect the EZ . Itsn1L is multi - domain scaffold 430 protein that interacts with several endocytic proteins to orchestrate endocytosis and 431 could thus have a central role as scaffold in the EZ . However , Itsn1L knockdown did 432 not alter the fraction of EZ - positive PSDs ( Figure 7E , F ) . Altogether , based on these 433 mechanistic experiments , we conclude that the EZ is assembled from a distinct set of 434 endocytic proteins and is maintained and positioned primarily by interactions with the 435 PSD . 436 437 22 438 23 Figure 7 .

A particularly important clathrin 455 structure in neurons , the postsynaptic EZ , is characterized by the stable accumulation 456 of clathrin associated with the PSD . Localized endocytosis of synaptic receptors at the 457 EZ is essential for the maintenance and activity - directed changes in the composition 458 of the synaptic membrane . However , despite vigorous investigation of clathrin - coated 459 structures in various cell types , the molecular composition and organization of the EZ 460 has remained largely elusive . Here , we present evidence that the EZ is a highly unique 461 clathrin structure . We found that a defined arsenal of endocytic proteins is differentially 462 retained at the EZ and highly organized at the nanoscale level with respect to the 463 clathrin assembly . 464 Our data show that the postsynaptic EZ can be clearly distinguished from other 465 dendritic clathrin assemblies . Clathrin - coated structures in the dendritic shaft form a 466 highly heterogenous population , including small , fast - moving particles , as well as 467 larger stationary structures . This heterogeneity in clathrin - coated structures resembles 468 those found in other cell types , where a large variety of clathrin assemblies have been 469 identified . Often , small clathrin structures represent transient endocytic pits or 470 intracellular vesicles while the large patches are stable , membrane - attached 471 structures ( Grove et al . , 2014 ; Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Indeed , 472 we found that the small structures in the dendritic shaft are often transient or moving , 473 most likely representing endocytic pits or cargo vesicles , while the larger assemblies 474 are stationary but still undergo dynamic exchange of clathrin . The function of these 475 larger dendritic patches remains unknown . In dendritic spines , we found that the 476 morphological characteristics of the EZ are highly similar from spine to spine , with 477 much less variation in size and dynamics than observed for clathrin structures in the 478 dendritic shaft . Moreover , the EZ appeared as a long - lived and fluorescently stable 479 25 clathrin structure with relatively low exchange of clathrin , in line with previous studies 480 ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; Petrini et al . , 2009 ; Rosendale et al . , 2017 ; Scheefhals et al . , 481 2019 ) . Together , these results indicate that based on the morphological and dynamic 482 behavior of clathrin , the EZ can be distinguished from other clathrin assemblies found 483 in the dendritic shaft . 484 The EZ has been postulated as a primary site for endocytosis of synaptic 485 membrane proteins to sort these components in the local recycling machinery and 486 effectively retain these at the synaptic membrane ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , 487 several studies have unequivocally demonstrated that in the absence of the EZ 488 endocytic trafficking of glutamate receptors is severely affected , leading to the net loss 489 of membrane - expressed receptors and consequential deregulated glutamatergic 490 signaling ( Cortese et al . , 2016 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ; Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2014 ; Petrini 491 et al . , 2009 ; Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) . Formation of endocytic vesicles containing 492 synaptic receptors has also been directly visualized in close proximity to the PSD 493 ( Rosendale et al . , 2017 ) , supporting the endocytic capacity of the EZ . In our live - cell 494 experiments , we occasionally observed the formation of a secondary clathrin structure 495 from the larger , primary clathrin structure . Further , super - resolution imaging allowed 496 us to resolve the EZ at higher resolution and we often found that PSDs were 497 associated with more than one clathrin structure , with the secondary , smaller structure 498 often having a size similar to those described for clathrin - coated vesicles ( Kirchhausen 499 et al . , 2014 ) . These secondary structures were often 200 - 250 nm away from the 500 border of the PSD , i . e . , more distant from the PSD than the EZ that was closely ( within 501 ~ 30 nm ) associated . Similarly , EM studies showed that clathrin coated vesicles bud 502 off from the membrane preferentially at 100 - 600 nm from the PSD ( Rácz et al . , 2004 ) . 503 Thus , although we did not reach sufficient resolution to unequivocally resolve clathrin - 504 26 coated pits associated with the EZ , our data is consistent with the idea that endocytic 505 pits bud off at the edge of the EZ . 506 Importantly , our findings significantly expand on the notion that the EZ is a 507 perisynaptic site of endocytosis by identifying several key endocytic proteins that 508 reside at the EZ . Based on our live - cell imaging , quantitative super - resolution imaging 509 and mechanistic studies we conclude that ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Eps15 , and Itsn1L are stable 510 EZ residents that localize preferentially at the edge of the EZ . HIP1R and Dyn2 were 511 also stably associated with the EZ , but this association seemed independent of EZ - 512 PSD coupling . PICALM , FCHO1 , Epsn2 and Amph were associated with the EZ to a 513 much lesser extent and appeared only transiently at perisynaptic sites . Thus , different 514 classes of endocytic proteins , both early - and late - phase proteins are associated with 515 the EZ . 516 The early - phase endocytic proteins ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Epsn2 , Eps15 , Itsn1L and 517 FCHO1 are all vital for the initial stages of endocytosis ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Henne 518 et al . , 2010 ; Kirchhausen et al . , 2014 ; Reider et al . , 2009 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . We 519 found that the localization patterns of these proteins in neurons were overall very 520 similar , with clear puncta throughout the dendritic shaft and spines . However , in 521 contrast to ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Eps15 and Itsn1L that were stably associated with the PSD , 522 Epsn2 and FCHO1 appeared solely as transient , short - lived puncta close to the PSD . 523 Interestingly , the FCHO and Epsin proteins contain F - BAR domains and preferentially 524 bind curved membranes . Thus , perhaps these proteins are only transiently recruited 525 to the EZ upon induction of endocytosis and the associated increase in membrane 526 curvature . ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Eps15 and Itsn1L were stably associated with the PSD , and 527 located preferentially at the edge of the clathrin structure , surprisingly consistent with 528 findings on flat clathrin lattices in non - neuronal cells ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) . The 529 27 accumulation of the AP - 2 complex and its binding partner Eps15 at the periphery of 530 the EZ likely contributes to the efficient capture of cargoes , i . e . , synaptic membrane 531 proteins , and their local uptake via endocytosis . Itsn1 is a multi - domain scaffold protein 532 that coordinates different aspects of endocytosis . Itsn1 interacts with AP - 2 ( Pechstein 533 et al . , 2010 ) , acts as a GEF for Cdc42 ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ) , and regulates dynamin 534 recruitment ( Evergren et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , Itsn1 could have a central organizing role at 535 the EZ . Consistently , we recently reported that Itsn1 knockdown abrogates mGluR - 536 mediated AMPAR trafficking ( van Gelder et al . , 2020 ) . The results presented here 537 show that Itsn1 knockdown does not alter the location or overall morphology of the EZ 538 indicating that while Itsn1 has likely an important role in coordinating endocytosis at 539 the EZ , Itsn1 does not seem to directly support the maintenance of this clathrin 540 structure . 541 The late - phase endocytic proteins Dyn2 and Amph are both required for the 542 efficient fission of endocytic vesicles , the final step of endocytosis . Amph , like the other 543 BAR proteins Epsn2 and FCHO1 , appeared mostly diffusely distributed throughout the 544 dendrite and was only transiently associated with the PSD . Dyn2 however , seemed 545 stably retained close to the PSD and localized at the EZ . In most cases , we found that 546 the distribution of Dyn2 at the EZ was diffuse , but the clear differential localization 547 patterns between different EZs may indicate that dynamin relocates to the EZ upon 548 endocytosis as has been suggested before ( Rosendale et al . , 2017 ) . We found that 549 the expression of the two Syndapins ( or PACSINs ) , Sdp1 and Sdp2 was diffuse 550 throughout the neuron and we found no clear association with the PSD . Nevertheless , 551 Sdp1 was found to be involved in activity - induced internalization of glutamate 552 receptors and sorting of vesicles after budding of the membrane ( Anggono et al . , 2013 ; 553 Widagdo et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , the Syndapins seem not stably associated with the EZ , 554 28 but could be involved in directing the endocytic vesicles that emerge from the EZ 555 through the endosomal system . 556 The EZ is most likely associated with the membrane , however if and how this 557 association is established remains unknown . Several proteins that we identified here 558 as EZ components could couple the EZ to the membrane . For example , the AP2 559 complex directly binds clathrin heavy chain and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate 560 ( PIP2 ) ( Beacham et al . , 2019 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Kadlecova et al . , 2017 ; 561 Mettlen et al . , 2018 ; Owen et al . , 2000 ; Shih et al . , 1995 ; Traub et al . , 1999 ) and we 562 found that ꞵ 2 - adaptin was stably associated with the EZ . However , we found that 563 expression of a dominant - negative form of AP2mu2 that cannot bind PIP2 did not 564 abrogate EZ positioning . Another candidate , PICALM can also simultaneously bind 565 PIP2 and clathrin ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) , but we found that PICALM was only transiently 566 associated with the PSD and is thus unlikely to form a stable intermediate between 567 the EZ and the membrane . Thus , either these components are not involved in coupling 568 the EZ to the membrane or membrane anchoring is not a prerequisite for EZ 569 positioning . 570 The actin cytoskeleton is prominent in dendritic spines and supports many 571 aspects of synaptic transmission and plasticity . Several endocytic proteins that we 572 found enriched at the EZ could link the EZ to the actin cytoskeleton . For instance , both 573 HIP1R and CPG2 are actin - binding proteins , were enriched in dendritic spines and 574 associated with the PSD . Notably , these results are consistent with previous studies 575 that found that CPG2 localizes to the EZ ( Cottrell et al . , 2004 ; Nedivi , 1999 ) and is 576 essential for glutamate receptor trafficking ( Loebrich et al . , 2016 ; Loebrich et al . , 577 2013 ) . In fact , of all the proteins that we analyzed in the current study , CPG2 was the 578 most persistently associated with the PSD , and appeared to be even more stable than 579 clathrin , suggesting that CPG2 could have a function in stabilizing and maintaining the 580 29 EZ . HIP1R directly binds clathrin light - chain and physically links clathrin to F - actin 581 ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) , to 582 promote actin polymerization at endocytic sites . Moreover , HIP1R has been shown 583 before to be involved in maintaining stable clathrin structures ( Grove et al . , 2014 ; 584 Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Surprisingly however , neither disruption of the actin 585 cytoskeleton with pharmacological compounds , nor interfering with the HIP1R - CLC 586 association significantly disrupted the localization or integrity of the EZ . Thus , the actin 587 cytoskeleton is most likely involved in facilitating endocytosis at the EZ , but does not 588 seem to have a prime structural role in maintaining or positioning the EZ . 589 We and others have consistently found that the EZ is stabilized and associated 590 with the PSD by Shank - Homer - Dynamin3 interactions ( Lu et al . , 2007 ; Scheefhals et 591 al . , 2019 ) . Interestingly , we found that interfering with this interaction by depletion of 592 Shank proteins , specifically the stable , early endocytic proteins , ꞵ 2 - adaptin , Eps15 593 and Itsn1L uncoupled from the PSD . On the other hand , HIP1R and Dyn2 remained 594 enriched in spines after Shank knockdown . Together with our findings that HIP1R and 595 Dyn2 are more homogenously distributed relative to the EZ suggests that these 596 proteins are not directly coupled to the EZ under basal conditions but rather 597 preferentially reside in close proximity via other interactions . 598 Taken all together , we found that the EZ is a highly organized clathrin structure 599 where endocytic proteins are differentially retained and stabilized . This distinct 600 organization likely facilitates the efficient capture and endocytosis of synaptic 601 membrane proteins close to the PSD . These findings motivate further investigation 602 into the molecular composition , the mechanisms that control the recruitment and 603 activation of individual EZ components and the coupling of the EZ to the intracellular 604 endosomal system . Elucidating these aspects of the EZ will contribute to a better 605 30 understanding of this subcellular structure in neurons that is so critical for the 606 maintenance and activity - dependent modulation of neuronal synapses . 607 608 MATERIALS AND METHODS 609 Animals 610 All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines for the 611 welfare of experimental animals issued by the Government of the Netherlands ( Wet 612 op de Dierproeven , 1996 ) and European regulations ( Guideline 86 / 609 / EEC ) .

Van Bergen en Henegouwen The 651 following constructs have been described before : Homer1c - mCherry , Homer1c - GFP , 652 Dynamin2 - GFP ( Scheefhals et al . , 2019 ) , pSM155 - mirItsn - GFP ( van Gelder et al . , 653 2020 ) , GFP - CLCa knock - in construct ( Willems et al . , 2020 ) . 654 655 Immunocytochemistry and HaloTag labelling 656 32 Neurons were fixed between DIV16 - 21 with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA , EM grade ) 657 diluted in PEM buffer ( 80 mM PIPES , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl2 , pH 7 . 4 ) for 10 658 minutes at 37ºC and washed three times with PBS supplemented with 100 mM glycine 659 ( PBS - gly ) . Then , neurons were permeabilized and blocked with 10 % normal goat 660 serum ( NGS ) and 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 ( TX ) in PBS - gly for 30 minutes at 37ºC . For 661 STED imaging , GFP and mCherry containing constructs were enhanced with 662 corresponding polyclonal anti - GFP ( 1 : 2000 , MBL ) and anti - mCherry ( 1 : 1000 , 663 Clonetech ) antibodies diluted in PBS - gly supplemented with 5 % NGS and 0 . 01 % TX , 664 for an overnight at 4ºC . The next day , coverslips were washed three times in PBS - gly 665 and anti - GFP was further labelled with ATTO647N ( 1 : 500 , Sigma ) and anti - mCherry 666 was labelled with CF568 ( 1 : 500 , Sigma ) for 2 hours at room temperature ( RT ) , washed 667 and mounted in Mowiol ( Sigma ) . For SMLM on Homer - mCherry and GFP - CLCa the 668 same procedure was used as described above , but anti - GFP was labelled with Alexa - 669 647 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Life Technologies ) . After two hours , coverslips 670 were washed three times and kept in PBS until further use . For SMLM on Halo - CLCa 671 combined with various endocytic proteins fused to GFP , we first performed live - 672 labeling with Halo - JF646 ( 1 : 1000 , Promega ) for 15 minutes at RT . To label endocytic 673 proteins , GFP was labelled with a monoclonal anti - GFP ( 1 : 1000 , Thermo Fisher ) and 674 labelled with a corresponding CF568 - conjugated secondary antibody ( Sigma ) . 675 Although the localization density obtained for Halo - CLCa labelled with JF646 was 676 lower compared to GFP - CLCa labelled with primary and secondary antibodies , no 677 difference in CLCa morphology was observed ( Supplement Figure 2 ) . 678 679 Confocal imaging 680 Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal laser - scanning 681 microscope using a Plan - Apochromat 63x NA 1 . 40 oil objective . Images consist of a 682 33 z - stack of 5 - 9 planes at 0 . 37 - µm interval , and maximum intensity projections were 683 generated in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) for analysis and display . 684 685 STED imaging 686 Gated STED ( gSTED ) images were taken with the Leica TCS SP83x microscope 687 using a HC PL APO 100x / NA 1 . 4 oil immersion STED WHITE objective . The 488 nm 688 pulsed white laser ( 80 MHz ) was used to excite Alexa - 488 , 561 nm to excite CF568 , 689 and the 647 nm to excite JF646 and ATTO647N labeled proteins . JF646 and 690 ATTO647N were depleted with the 775 - nm pulsed depletion laser , and for depleting 691 CF568 the 660 - nm pulsed depletion laser was used . The internal Leica HyD hybrid 692 detector was set at time gate between 0 . 3 and 6 ns . Images were taken with a pixel 693 size lower than 40 nm , and Z - stacks were acquired . Maximum intensity projections 694 were generated in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) for analysis and display . 695 696 Live - cell imaging 697 Live - cell imaging was performed on a spinning disk confocal system ( CSU - X1 - A1 ; 698 Yokogawa ) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope ( Nikon ) with Plan Apo VC 100x 699 1 . 40 NA with excitation from Cobolt Calyspso ( 491 nm ) , and Jive ( 561 nm ) lasers , and 700 emission filters ( Chroma ) . The microscope was equipped with a motorized XYZ stage 701 ( ASI ; MS - 2000 ) , Perfect Focus System ( Nikon ) , Evolve 512 EM - CCD camera 702 ( Photometrics ) , and was controlled by MetaMorph 7 . 7 . 6 software ( Molecular Devices ) . 703 Neurons were maintained in a closed incubation chamber ( Tokai hit : INUBG2E - ZILCS ) 704 at 37 ºC in extracellular imaging buffer . For high frequency live - cell imaging ( Figure 705 2A - D ) images of GFP - CLCa were taken every 5 seconds for 5 minutes . For long - term 706 live - cell imaging of Homer1c and CLCa ( Figure 2E ) , images were taken every 30 707 seconds for 20 minutes . Lastly , imaging Homer1c and endocytic proteins fused to 708 34 either mCherry or GFP was done taking images every 20 seconds for 10 minutes . In 709 all the above - mentioned experiments Z - stacks of 5 - 9 planes were acquired , with 710 varying step sizes per neuron . Also Homer1c - mCherry was only imaged in the first 711 and last frame . Maximum intensity images were analyzed in Fiji , by manually drawing 712 same - size ROIs around individual puncta associated with PSDs . To measure lifetimes 713 of clathrin and endocytic proteins we used the TrackMate plugin ( Tinevez et al . , 2017 ) . 714 715 Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching 716 FRAP experiments were performed on the spinning disk confocal system as described 717 above , using the ILas2 system ( Roche scientific ) . A baseline of 2 minutes with a 20 - 718 second interval was taken , followed by photobleaching of individual puncta with a 719 targeted laser . The recovery of fluorescence of GFP - CLCa was imaged for 3 minutes 720 with 20 - second interval , followed by 12 minutes with 60 - second interval , and 4 minutes 721 with 120 - second interval , resulting in a total recovery time of 19 minutes . For imaging 722 the recovery of the endocytic proteins an acquisition of 10 minutes was taken ( 2 - 723 minute baseline , 3 minutes with 20 - second interval and 7 minutes with 60 - second 724 interval ) . For acquiring FRAP images , a single Z - plane was taken . Fluorescence 725 intensity was measured in Fiji , by manually drawing same - size ROIs around puncta . 726 For analysis , acquisitions were corrected for drift . For each ROI , the mean intensity 727 was measured for every time point and corrected for background and bleaching . 728 Normalized intensities were plotted over time . Individual curves were fitted with a 729 single - exponential function I = A ( 1 – exp ( - Kt ) ) to estimate the mobile fraction ( A ) and 730 time constant tau . 731 732 Single - molecule localization microscopy and analysis 733 35 dSTORM data was acquired on the Nanoimager S from ONI ( Oxford Nanoimaging 734 Ltd . ) , equipped with a 100x , 1 . 4NA oil immersion objective , an XYZ closed - loop piezo 735 stage , and four laser lines : 405 - nm , 471 - nm , 561 - nm and 640 - nm . Fluorescence 736 emission was detected using a sCMOS camera ( ORCA Flash 4 , Hamamatsu ) . Stacks 737 of 10 , 000 images were acquired at 20 Hz in TIRF mode . Samples were imaged in PBS 738 containing 10 - 50 mM MEA , 5 % w / v glucose , 700 μg / ml glucose oxidase , and 40 739 μg / ml catalase . Data was processed in NimOS software from ONI . Before each 740 imaging session , a bead sample calibration was performed to align the two channels , 741 achieving a channel mapping precision smaller than 8 nm . Images were rendered in 742 ONI software and loaded into Fiji . Here , ROIs of 1 x 1 µm were drawn around individual 743 EZ . The ROI sets were imported in Matlab ( 2018b ) for analysis . 744 First , tracking was performed on the localization data to merge localizations that 745 were detected in more than two consecutive frames as described in ( Willems et al . , 746 2020 ) . Next , a localization cutoff of 15 nm was taken to further analyze the localization 747 data . A DBScan was performed to define the borders of Homer1c and CLCa in figure 748 4 , using an epsilon of 0 . 2 and minimum number of localizations of 100 . For figure 6 , 749 an epsilon of 0 . 35 and minimum number of localizations of 50 was used . For figure 6 , 750 rings were applied to reveal the relative distribution of endocytic proteins to the EZ . 751 Rings were calculated as a percentage of the 100 % polyshape given by the DBScan . 752 Inwards , 5 rings were created : 0 - 20 , 20 - 40 , 40 - 60 , 60 - 80 , 80 - 100 ; and outwards 3 753 rings were created : 100 - 120 , 120 - 140 , 140 - 160 . Then , the number of localizations for 754 each of the endocytic proteins were calculated per ring . The fraction of these 755 localizations per EZ , were plotted against the fraction of the area of the ring and 756 normalized to 1 . 757 758 Quantification of EZ - associated synapses 759 36 For the Shank knockdown experiments DIV14 neurons were transfected with pSM155 - 760 mCherry or pSM155 - mirShank - mCherry together with Homer1c - ALFA and indicated 761 construct . Homer1c - ALFA was labelled with JF646 - conjugated FluoTAG X4 anti - ALFA 762 ( 1 : 500 Fluotag X4 , Nanotag ) . In the experiments manipulating actin dynamics , Homer - 763 mCherry and GFP - CLCa expressing neurons were incubated with Latrunculin B ( 20 764 µM , Bioconnect ) , CK666 ( 400 µM , Tocris ) or Jasplakinolide ( 20 µM , Tocris ) in E4 for 765 30 minutes at 37˚C and fixed immediately after . As a control E4 containing DMSO was 766 used . GFP - CLCa or GFP - CLCb - EED / QQN were co - expressed with Homer1c - 767 mCherry . pSM155 - mirItsn was co - expressed with Homer1c - mCherry and Halo - CLCa 768 labelled with JF646 . AP2m1 - WT or AP2m1 - P1 - HA was co - expressed with Homer1c - 769 mCherry and GFP - CLCa . To quantify the fraction of synapses with an associated EZ 770 or puncta of endocytic protein , circular regions with a fixed diameter ( 0 . 69 - 0 . 89 µm ) 771 were centered on the Homer1c signal to outline synaptic regions . These regions were 772 then transferred to the GFP - CLC or tagged endocytic protein channel . A synapse was 773 classified positive if the endocytic protein cluster overlapped partially or completely 774 with the circular region . The fraction of positive synapses was calculated per cell and 775 averaged per condition over the total population of neurons . Data plotted is normalized 776 to the average of the control . 777 778 Statistical analysis 779 Statistical significance was tested using a student’s t - test when comparing two groups . 780 When comparing multiple groups statistical significance was tested using a one - way 781 ANOVA followed by a Tukey or Dunnett’s multiple comparison post - hoc test . All the 782 statistical tests with a p - value below 0 . 05 were considered significant . In all figures , 783 significance is indicated as follows : p < 0 . 05 is indicated by * , p < 0 . 01 by * * , and p < 784 0 . 001 by * * * . Analysis was performed on neurons originating from at least two 785 37 individual batches of hippocampal neurons . Number of neurons used for analysis is 786 indicated as N , number of spines or clathrin - coated structures is represented as n . 787 788 ACKNOWLEGDEMENTS 789 We would like to thank all members of the MacGillavry lab for support and discussions . 790 This work was supported by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research 791 ( NWO - ALWOP . 191 to H .
