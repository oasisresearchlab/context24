To compare maternal , fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS - CoV - 2 infected pregnant women with those of non - infected patients . STUDY DESIGN : Through an universal PCR testing for SARS - COV - 2 at admission ( not symptoms - based ) , this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16 th of June and the 16 th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center . RESULTS : 507 pregnant women were included during the study period , of which 137 ( 27 % ) were infected with SARS - COV - 2 . On admission , only 34 / 137 ( 24 . 8 % ) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms . Among asymptomatic women , 16 / 103 ( 15 % ) became symptomatic after diagnosis . Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow - up , 87 / 137 ( 63 . 5 % ) remained always asymptomatic , 45 / 137 ( 32 . 8 % ) developed a mild COVID - 19 and 5 / 137 ( 3 . 6 % ) developed a severe infection . SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients were more likely to have post - partum hemorrhage > 500 ml ( 14 . 2 % vs 7 . 2 % , RR 2 . 0 [ 95 % CI 1 . 1 - 3 . 4 ] ) , to be transfused ( 5 . 5 % vs 1 . 1 % , RR 4 . 9 [ 1 . 5 - 16 . 6 ] ) , and to be hospitalized in ICU ( 3 . 6 % vs 0 . 8 % , RR 4 . 5 [ 95 % CI 1 . 1 - 18 . 6 ] than uninfected ones . Intra - uterine fetal demises were more common in infected mothers compared to controls ( 5 . 1 % vs 1 . 1 % , RR 4 . 7 [ 95 % CI 1 . 4 - 45 . 9 ) . Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth , none tested positive ( 0 / 108 ) . When tested between 25 and 42 hours after delivery , 4 / 29 ( 13 . 7 % ) were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and remained asymptomatic . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 CONCLUSION : Pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with a SARS - COV - 2 infection through an universal screening were symptomatic in only a quarter of cases . Their risks of post - partum hemorrhage , transfusion and admission to ICU were higher than those of uninfected patients . They also presented a higher risk of intra - uterine fetal demise . There were no other differences in maternal , obstetrical or neonatal outcomes . KEYWORDS : Pregnancy , SARS - CoV - 2 infection , maternal outcomes , stillbirth , neonatal outcomes . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 INTRODUCTION The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is a public health emergency declared by WHO as a global public health emergency [ 1 ] . Although there is a growing understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 , the outcomes associated with SARS - CoV2 infection during pregnancy remain limited and unclear . Based on previous viral exposition , pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to infections with potential for adverse pregnancy or perinatal outcomes [ 2 , 3 ] . Unfortunately , the lack of a comparative group makes COVID 19 studies not strong enough to found adequate power to assess these outcomes . Unfortunately , the infection is re - emerging in many countries ; it is an urgent need to analyze the result of the first wave . The lack of an universal screening at admission ( most of patients tested being symptomatic ) may lead to selection biases and to a misunderstanding of the potential consequences of SARS - COV - 2 infection during pregnancy [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . On the fetal side , many questions arise about the effect of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection during pregnancy . A few reports , based on biological and histological findings of electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry suggest vertical transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 7 ] but evidence is still uncertain . In the last weeks , as many countries in Latin America , Covid - 19 has rapidly spread to French Guiana territory , a French department located in South America , north of Brazil . Early in the beginning of the epidemic , we implemented universal testing with RT - PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs to identify SARS - COV - 2 infections in pregnant women admitted to the maternity of the West French Guiana Hospital Center ( Centre Hospitalier de l’Ouest Guyanais , CHOG ) . The aims of this study were to describe the proportions of asymptomatic , mild and severe diseases in infected pregnant women admitted for delivery ; and to compare maternal , fetal and J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 neonatal outcomes of SARS - CoV - 2 infected pregnant women with those of non - infected patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS This observational prospective cohort study carried out in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the CHOG ( referral center of western French Guiana ) during the first 8 weeks of the SARSCoV - 2 outbreak in the West French Guiana territory , from the 16 of June to the 16 of August 2020 . Protocol description The west French Guiana territory was spared from COVID 19 before the beginning of this report . At the beginning of the outbreak , our hospital implemented a systematic screening for all pregnant women admitted for delivery using SARS - CoV - 2 real - time reverse - transcriptase polymerase - chain - reaction ( RT - qPCR ) assays ( Xpert Xpress , Cepheid , Sunnyvale , USA ) on nasopharyngeal swabs . At admission , both RT - qPCR and serological analysis were performed . Results were obtained after 51 minutes using a machine installed in the delivery room . Positive patients were isolated . Serologies were performed on Abbott ARCHITECT SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay ( Abbott , Longford , Ireland ) . Testing for SARS - CoV - 2 in placental tissue was performed using RT - qPCR in the National Reference Center of the Pasteur Institute , French Guiana . The reason of this policy was to better manage hospitalization , avoid intra hospital contamination and to protect others parturient and medical staff . Antenatal care was provided by obstetricians and midwifes in accordance with the clinical practice of the French College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians . All patients were clinically evaluated . Fetal wellbeing was confirmed by cardiotocography . If necessary , ultrasonographic evaluation was performed . All women presented with a fever were also screened for Dengue virus . CHOG policy authorize mothers to practice skin - to - skin care and breastfeed in the delivery room . She had to wear a surgical mask and to practice proper hand hygiene before skin - to - skin J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 contact , breastfeeding , and routine care . All patients were monitored 14 days after hospital discharge either by telephone call or by home visit according to their clinical forms . Outcomes and variables definitions Inclusion criteria were pregnant women admitted for delivery beyond 15 weeks of gestation and tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infection on an RT - PCR assay performed on a nasopharyngeal swab . This population was divided into two groups : an exposed group , defined as confirmed SARS - CoV2 infected pregnant women ( positive RT - PCR ) ; and a control group , defined by a negative SARS - CoV2 RT - PCR with negative serology when available . Primary outcome : We evaluated the proportions of asymptomatic , mild and severe diseases among SARS - COV - 2 infected pregnant women , according to the World Health Organization criteria [ 8 ] . Adverse maternal outcomes included maternal death , intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission and oxygen support ( non - invasive ventilation , endotracheal intubation ) . Adverse obstetrical outcomes included preterm delivery ( spontaneous or induced delivery < 34wg ) , operative vaginal delivery or emergency cesarean section , acute fetal distress , postpartum hemorrhage ( > 500mL ) and transfusion . Adverse fetal outcomes included late miscarriages ( > 14wg ) and intra - uterine fetal demises ( spontaneous antepartum fetal death > 20wg ) . Adverse neonatal outcomes included per - partum or neonatal death , NICU admission , respiratory distress , seizures , Apgar score ≤ 7 at 1 min , umbilical venous lactate ≥ 5 mmol / l at birth and a low birthweight ( < 3 rd percentile , according to Intergrowth21st charts ) . Secondary outcomes : All maternal , obstetrical and neonatal complications directly related or not related to COVID - 19 infection were reported . Neonatal testing for SARS - COV - 2 infection J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 at birth and 24 to 48 hours after birth , using RT - PCR assays on naso - pharyngeal swabs , was also reported . Data Collection Data were collected prospectively and anonymously using an excel spreadsheet . The follow - up was completed on August 31 , 2020 . In compliance with the Regulation ( EU ) 2016 / 679 of the European Parliament on the protection of personal data a privacy impact assessment of the study was carried out according to the methodology described by the French data protection ( CNIL ) . The risk mapping report was approved by the establishment ' s ethics committee ( decision CHOG 2020 - 08 - 17 ) . Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using STATA® v13 . 0 . Student’s t - test was used to compare continuous variables , whereas the comparison of proportions was performed using the chi - square test or Fisher’s exact test , as appropriate . The unpaired Student’s t - test and the Mann – Whitney U - test were used to compare groups of continuous normally and non - normally distributed variables , respectively . Presented P - values were two - sided and the significance level was set to 5 % ( p = 0 . 05 ) for all statistical tests . Relative risks were estimated using a generalized linear model , adjusted for unbalanced maternal characteristics that could represent confounding factors and stratified for potential interactions with primary outcomes . Neonatal outcomes analysis included a robust variance option for twin pregnancies in the model . RESULTS Study population During the study period , 507 pregnant women were admitted for delivery at the CHOG . Among them 137 / 507 ( 27 % ) had a confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection with positive RT - PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs ( Figure 1 ) . In the control group , all patient had negative RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 . In SARS - COV - 2 RT - PCR positive mothers , results of serology were obtained in 76 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 patients ( 55 . 4 % ) . It was negative in 36 . 8 % ( 28 / 76 ) , positive in 60 . 5 % ( 46 / 76 ) and doubtful in 2 cases ( 2 . 6 % ) . Among those tested negative on RT - PCR ( i . e . control group ) , serological testing was performed in 21 . 6 % ( 80 / 370 ) and was negative for all cases . There were 127 alive neonates from positive mothers and 364 neonates ≥ 25 WG from negative mothers including five sets of twins . We have documented 11 stillbirths , 4 termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies and 6 extremely preterm infants 22 - 25WG ( live births followed by a neonatal death ) . Baseline characteristics Maternal characteristics and comorbidities are presented in table 1 . There were no significant differences between the two groups of infected and non - infected pregnant women for age , BMI , BMI > 30 kg / m2 , comorbidities , gravida , parity , scarred uterus , and pathologies during pregnancy before testing . Twin pregnancies were only present in the control group ( 5 / 370 , 1 . 4 % ) . Clinical and biological course of patients diagnosed with SARS - COV - 2 infection at admission On admission , only 34 / 137 ( 24 . 8 % ) of positive patients presented clinical symptoms of COVID 19 . Among 103 asymptomatic women ( 103 / 137 , 75 . 2 % ) , 16 / 103 ( 15 % ) became symptomatic after diagnosis , often occurring after returning home ( including two severe cases ) . The most reported symptoms were fever ( 21 / 50 , 42 % ) , headache ( 17 / 50 , 34 % ) , loss of taste and smell ( 12 / 50 , 24 % ) , tiredness ( 9 / 50 , 18 % ) , cough ( 8 / 50 , 16 % ) , diarrhea or abdominal pain ( 3 / 50 , 6 % ) and shortness of breath ( 2 / 50 , 4 % ) . Throughout the delivery hospitalization and the follow - up after returning home , 87 / 137 ( 63 . 5 % ) were completely asymptomatic , 45 / 137 ( 32 . 8 % ) had mild COVID - 19 and 5 / 137 ( 3 . 6 % ) had severe infection according to World Health Organization criteria ( Figure 2 ) . Four patients ( 2 . 9 % ) were re - admitted for complication related to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised inﬂammatory markers of C - reactive protein or procalcitonin ( 35 % ) , thrombopenia ( 10 . 1 % ) , lymphopenia ( 2 . 1 % ) and elevated transaminases ( 3 . 6 % ) . Obstetrical outcomes There were no differences in mode of delivery ( operative vaginal delivery , cesarean section before labor , or cesarean section in labor ) and abnormal fetal heart rate ( table 2 ) . There were no significant differences in spontaneous births before 37 weeks’ gestation ( 8 . 6 % vs 10 % , p = 0 . 78 ) and before 34 weeks’ gestation ( 0 . 7 % vs 2 . 5 % , p = 0 . 46 ) . The risk of iatrogenic preterm birth and caesarean delivery was not significatively increased ( 0 % vs 0 . 8 % , p = 0 . 57 ) . None of the cesarean sections were performed for worsening maternal respiratory status . In two patients with severe COVID - 19 , C - section extraction was contemplated for women under oxygen therapy at 35 + 1 WG and 34 + 6 WG . Finally , the delivery was postponed after stabilization of respiratory condition . Evolution was good under curative anticoagulation , high doses of oral Prednisone and antibiotics . They gave normal vaginal birth after spontaneous labor . In post - partum period , SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients were more likely to have post - partum hemorrhage > 500 ml ( 18 / 127 , 14 . 2 % vs 26 / 359 , 7 . 2 % ) and to be transfused ( 7 / 127 , 5 . 5 % vs 4 / 359 , 1 . 1 % ) when compared to non - infected patients : RR 2 . 0 [ 95 % CI 1 . 1 - 3 . 4 ] and RR 4 . 9 [ 95 % CI 1 . 5 - 16 . 6 ] , respectively . Twin pregnancies were tested as an effect - modifier on these outcomes and did not modify the crude analysis since neither PPH nor transfusion occurred in twin pregnancies . Biological analysis showed hemostatic disorder before delivery only in 2 / 18 of these patients with post - partum hemorrhage ( prothrombin time at 60 % , prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time ) . We do not observe any difference in the clinical forms , maternal or fetal outcomes when considering sub analysis including positive and negative serology . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 Maternal outcomes SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients were more often admitted to intensive care unit when compared to non - infected patients : 3 . 7 % ( 5 / 137 ) vs 0 . 8 % ( 3 / 370 ) , 4 . 5 [ 95 % CI 1 . 1 - 18 . 6 ] . Four patients were retested when readmitted for complication related to COVID 19 and they remained positive . Intensive care unit admission was required in 2 . 1 % ( 3 / 137 ) for complication related to COVID 19 , with no need of invasive ventilation . No maternal deaths occurred among these patients . Fetal and neonatal outcomes There were statistically significant differences between the two groups concerning fetal adverse outcomes ( table 2 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 infected pregnant women were less likely to give birth to alive neonates . The incidence of intra - uterine fetal demise was significantly higher in SARS - CoV - 2 infected pregnant women compared to uninfected ones : 5 . 1 % ( 7 / 137 ) vs 1 . 1 % ( 4 / 370 ) , RR 4 . 7 [ 1 . 4 – 15 . 9 ] . All stillbirth occurred in asymptomatic ( n = 6 ) and mild COVID 19 ( n = 1 ) patients , between 19 and 35 weeks of gestation . No medication related to COVID 19 was administered to these patients before fetal demise . We tested placenta for RT - PCR of SARS - CoV - 2 in 5 cases of intra uterine fetal demise . Placental fragments were negative for SARS - CoV - 2 . Unfortunately , in only one case family consented for fetal autopsy . Exam did not detect any significant abnormality in the fetus but showed vascular alteration in the placenta . For the others 6 cases , only histopathological examinations of the placenta were done . It showed acute chorioamnionitis in five cases , and retroplacental hematoma in one case . In all cases ( 7 patients ) , induction of labor was performed using association of mifepristone and Misoprostol and they delivered normally . There were no differences in the main clinical ( birth weight , Apgar score , respiratory distress , oxygen administration , NICU admission , neonatal seizure , or neonatal death ) or biological J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 ( umbilical venous lactate ) neonatal outcomes between the two groups ( Table 3 ) . All neonates continued to be clinically well and are growing appropriately . Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth , none tested positive ( 0 / 108 ) . When tested between 25 and 42 hours after delivery , 4 / 29 of neonates ( 13 . 7 % ) were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs . Two neonates were retested positive 3 and 6 days after . Newborns were breastfed , never separated from their mothers , and received medical surveillance at home for one month . All positive neonates remained asymptomatic . Discussion Principal findings of the study : Only a quarter of pregnant women who presented SARS - CoV - 2 infection in the peri - partum period had symptoms on admission . SARS - COV - 2 infected patients had increased risks of maternal ( ICU admission , post - partum hemorrhage and transfusion ) and fetal ( intrauterine fetal demise ) adverse outcomes . The risk of intrauterine fetal demise did not depend on the clinical form at admission ; thus , the population of asymptomatic pregnant women is not spared of such adverse outcomes . This study focused on the consequences of SARS - COV - 2 infection diagnosed in the peri - partum period . For this reason , we considered only the beginning of the epidemic . Control group was composed of patients who tested negative for SARS - COV - 2 on RT - PCR ( systematic screening ) and serology when available . It was carried out in a maternity hospital in French Guiana , a French department located in South America north of Brazil . The French Guiana population is very heterogeneous with 70 % of patients of African origin with many other Amerindian , Asian , and European communities . In our population , we noticed a high rate of positive pregnant women ( 27 % ) in comparison to other reported series ( < 1 % in Southern California [ 6 ] and 13 . 7 % New York City [ 19 ] ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Lifestyle , low income and limited education among population in west French Guiana territory could probably explain such results . The findings of this study suggest that SARS - CoV - 2 does not affect pregnancy only through complications of hypoxemia and circulatory insufficiency . The most important question is whether the adverse outcomes in pregnant women infected by SARS CoV2 resulted from direct effects of SARS - CoV - 2 in the maternofetal compartment and therefore a possible vertical transmission . The exact mechanisms remain unclear . Is it hemodynamic , vascular , immunological , or hormonal ? The damage of the virus in the vascular system has been reported and could influence the feto - placental unit , notably with coagulopathy associated with COVID - 19 [ 9 , 10 ] . The SARS - CoV - 2 virus binds to angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) [ 11 ] found in many different human organs . ACE2 is a key part of the renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) and a counterbalance to angiotensin - converting enzyme 1 ( ACE1 ) and angiotensin II . Angiotensin II is proinflammatory , vasoconstrictive [ 12 ] . The mechanism is similar to those described in preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome . Federici et al reported hypertension and biological disorders suggesting pre - eclampsia and HELLP syndrome in a pregnant woman at 23 . 5 weeks of gestation with Covid - 19 complications ( acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with invasive mechanical ventilation ) [ 13 ] . Regarding mode of delivery , early experiences reported an important rate of cesarean section ( 50 to 91 % ) [ 14 , 15 ] among severe cases of Covid 19 . Fortunately , epidemic studies in pregnant women reported that as much as 90 % of SARS - CoV - 2 – positive cases were asymptomatic [ 16 , 17 , 18 ] . In our experience , we did not find an increased risk of cesarean section in either the symptomatic or asymptomatic group compared to the control group . It might be due to the protective effect of ethnicity [ 19 ] , genetic diversity of the virus [ 20 ] or the relatively small sample of severe SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Severe forms of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 COVID 19 or administration of oxygen therapy should not be an indication for premature extraction if stabilization of respiratory condition is possible . This was the case for two of our patients and another one reported by Federici et al [ 14 ] . Many authors [ 21 , 22 , 23 ] alerted about collateral damage , deleterious effects caused by the restrictions taken to limit the spread of the pandemic . Pregnant women who have multiple interactions with the health care system can been greatly affected by these actions . These effects are difficult to measure in clinical practice . The report of Khalil et al . demonstrates an increase in the stillbirth rate during the pandemic at St George’s University Hospital , London and attributed this to indirect factors without being able to exclude a direct consequence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 22 ] . Changes in obstetric services and health system disruption may have played a role in observed adverse outcomes in our cohort but it would also have affected the control group . Although first findings from a small group of cases suggested there is no vertical transmission in women who develop COVID - 19 [ 24 , 25 ] , rare observations reported vertical transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 with biological ( RT - PCR in amniotic fluid ) and histological findings based on electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry [ 26 , 27 ] . Main strengths and limitations of the study To the best of our knowledge , this is the first comparative study to report such increasing risks in mothers positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . We have ensured that the groups were highly comparable considering homogeneous population and a single protocol of management in order to minimize the effect of any confounding factors that can influence outcomes . Given the re - emergence of the virus in many countries and the lack of vaccine , our findings could help inform patients and healthcare providers , as well as develop appropriate management protocols for pregnant women with COVID - 19 . SARS - COV - 2 testing in all patients admitted for J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 delivery , regardless of their symptoms at admission and without lost to follow - up , ensures a risk of selection bias as low as possible . The findings of this study must be seen in light of some limitations . Firstly , this single - center cohort presents a relatively small number of patients infected with SARS - COV - 2 . We chose to limit the study at the first period of the epidemic to avoid including patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 but without active infection ( pre - partum infection with negative PCR at admission ) . Our group of infected patients permitted to highlight higher risks of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes , but we cannot exclude that a larger group could have permitted to describe more subtle consequences of COVID - 19 during pregnancy . At the opposite , the small number in control group might affect comparisons of some adverse outcomes as post - partum haemorrhage . Secondly , ethnicity and socioeconomic status were not reported in this study . Social precariousness and co - morbidities during pregnancy are particularly high in western French Guiana and could increase the risk of infection as well as the risk of adverse outcomes , and then be considered as a confounding factors . The rates of co - morbidities were relatively balanced across the groups . The socio - economic status of patients enrolled was not reported , and it is paramount to acknowledge that it might contribute to the increase of adverse outcomes observed in SARS - COV - 2 infected patients if it was lower in this group . Thirdly , at the beginning of the outbreak , we did not collect placenta and fetal samples for RT - PCR testing in the first cases of stillbirth . This could underestimate the risks of vertical transmission and subsequent adverse fetal outcomes . Finally , French Guiana territory is epidemic of other virus such as Dengue Virus . Active circulation of Dengue virus during the same period can influence the outcomes of pregnancy but not the comparison between the two groups . The small number of positive cases during the study period minimizes the influence of this factor on the results . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 Conclusion In conclusion , SARS - CoV - 2 infection in parturient admitted for delivery seems to be symptomatic in only a quarter of cases . SARS - CoV - 2 infected mothers presented higher risks of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes : ICU admission , post - partum hemorrhage , transfusion and fetal loss . Fetal outcomes did not depend on the clinical form of Covid 19 . For mothers , special awareness should be taken about significant risks of post - partum hemorrhage . Until more is known about this disease , it is paramount to perform close monitoring for infected pregnant women especially in immediate post - partum period .
