The purpose of this study was to determine if RON expression is altered in primary human colorectal adenocarcinomas . Results from immunohisto - chemical staining showed that RON is highly expressed in the majority of colorectal adenocarcinomas ( 29 / 49 cases ) . Accumulated RON is also constitutively active with autophosphorylation in tyrosine residues . Moreover , three splicing variants of RON , namely RON D 165 , RON D 160 , and RON D 155 were detected and cloned from two primary colon cancer samples . These RON variants were generated by deletions in different regions in extracellular domains of the RON b chain . Functional studies showed that expression of RON D 160 or RON D 155 in Martin – Darby canine kidney cells resulted in increased cell dissociation ( scatter - like activity ) . RON variants , RON D 160 and RON D 155 , also exerted the ability to induce multiple focus formation and sustain anchorage - independent growth of transfected NIH3T3 cells . More - over , NIH3T3 cells expressing RON D 160 or RON D 155 formed tumors in athymic nude mice and colonized in the lungs . These data suggest that RON expression is altered in certain primary colon cancers . Abnormal accumulation of RON variants may play a role in the progression of certain colorectal cancers in vivo .

Histologically , adenocarcinomas constitute the vast majority ( 98 % ) of colorectal tumors ( Crawford , 1994 ) . Inactivation of tumor - suppressor genes including ade - nomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) and p53 , and activation of oncogenes such as Ras have been linked to the initiation and progression of tumors ( Kinzler and Vogelstein , 1998 ) . However , the ability of tumors to invade and metastasize requires further cellular disorga - nization and genetic changes ( Portera et al . , 1988 ; Yokota , 1999 ) . Clinically , it is metastasis that marks a tumor as malignant because benign neoplasms do not metastasize ( Portera et al . , 1988 ; Crawford , 1994 ; Yokota , 1999 ) . Thus , understanding the mechanisms by which colorectal cancer metastasizes is of great physiological and clinical importance . Metastasis is a complicated process involving cell migration , adhesion , invasion , tissue destruction , and localization in remote sites ( Portera et al . , 1988 ; Yokota , 1999 ) . Invasiveness allows cancer cells to penetrate into blood vessels , lymphatics , and body cavities , which provides the opportunity to spread ( Portera et al . , 1988 ; Crawford , 1994 ; Yokota , 1999 ) . Many factors have been implicated in the invasiveness of epithelial cancers ( Dorudi and Hart , 1993 ) . Recently , members of the MET proto - oncogene family have drawn special atten - tion ( Birchmeier et al . , 1997 ; Vande Woude et al . , 1997 ) . The MET family , including MET and RON , belongs to a distinct subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases ( Rubin et al . , 1993 ; Porter and Vaillancourt , 1998 ) . They have the ability to induce cell dissociation , migration , and matrix invasion ( Comoglio et al . , 1999 ) . These features , collectively known as invasive growth , are controlled by a genetic program that is evolutionally conserved in the MET family members ( Birchmeier et al . , 1997 ; Vande Woude et al . , 1997 ; Comoglio et al . , 1999 ) . The RON cDNA was originally cloned from human foreskin keratinocytes ( Ronsin et al . , 1993 ) . Mature RON is a 180 kDa heterodimeric protein composed of a 40 kDa extracellular a chain and a 150 kDa transmem - brane b chain with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity ( Ronsin et al . , 1993 ) . RON is activated by macrophage - stimulating protein ( MSP ) ( Skeel et al . , 1991 ; Gaudino et al . , 1994 ; Wang et al . , 1994a ) , also Received 14 May 2002 ; revised 10 September 2002 ; accepted 24 September 2002 * Correspondence : M - H Wang , Department of Medicine , UCHSC / Denver Health Medical Center , 777 Bannock Street , Mail 4000 , Denver , CO 80204 , USA ; E - mail : ming - hai . wang @ uchsc . edu Oncogene ( 2003 ) 22 , 186 – 197 & 2003 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0950 - 9232 / 03 $ 25 . 00 www . nature . com / onc known as hepatocyte growth factor - like protein ( Han et al . , 1991 ) . MSP is a serum protein that is constitu - tively expressed by liver cells as an inactive form and requires proteolytic conversion for receptor binding ( Skeel et al . , 1991 ; Wang et al . , 1994b ) . Recent studies have shown that RON is highly expressed in the majority of primary breast carcinomas , but not in normal breast epithelia or benign lesions ( Maggiora et al . , 1998 ) . RON is also overexpressed in established human colorectal carcinoma cell lines including HT29 ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) , from which a novel RON variant was cloned ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . These results suggest that RON expression is deregulated in breast and colorectal cancer cells . Alteration of RON expression in colon cancer cells could result in the acquisition of a phenotype characterized by the ability of cells to migrate and penetrate through an artiﬁcial membrane ( Chen et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) , which correlates with the metastatic phenotype displayed in vivo by malignant tumors . Thus , it is hypothesized that abnormal accu - mulation and activation of RON are required in vivo for the acquisition of motile - invasive phenotypes during the progression of certain colorectal adenocarcinomas , particularly at metastatic stages . The present work was to determine if RON expres - sion is altered in primary human colorectal adenocarci - nomas . Immunohistochemical analysis was used to detect RON expression in 49 adenocarcinoma samples along with nine normal colorectal mucosa specimens . Experiments were also performed to study if RON variants are generated in primary tumors . Our results indicate that RON is highly expressed in the majority of colorectal adenocarcinomas . Overexpression also results in the generation of different and active RON variants that were identiﬁed and cloned from tumor samples . Functional analysis indicates that altered RON expres - sion might play an important role in pathogenesis of colorectal tumors . Results Expression of RON in normal colorectal mucosa and primary colorectal adenocarcinomas A total of 58 colorectal tissue specimens were examined for RON expression by immunohistochemical staining . Of these , 49 samples were of colon adenocarcinomas and nine were of normal colorectal mucosa obtained from nontumor - related surgery . The RON expression was ﬁrst determined in normal colorectal mucosa . RON was expressed in normal colorectal epithelia in all nine normal samples with similar intensities and patterns of staining . Representative results are shown in Figure 1 . By using a semiquantitative scoring method ( Allred et al . , 1998 ) , these nine samples scored 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 5 , and 5 , respectively . The mean score was 3 . 8 . The control serum ( from preimmunized rabbit ) did not provide any meaningful staining . The patterns of the RON staining are unique . RON is accumulated in the cytoplasm and cell surface as condensed granules . In cells close to the luminal surface , RON is universally expressed in lining epithelia including goblet cells ( Figure 1a ) . Immunoreactive RON was also detected in cells at the bottom of the crypt with similar expression patterns . However , the intensity of the staining is relatively weak ( Figure 1b ) . These characteristics of the staining were conﬁrmed by using three individual anti - RON antibodies that recognize different regions in the RON protein ( data not shown ) . Figure 1 Immunohistochemical detection of RON expression in normal human colon mucosa . Rabbit IgG to RON was used as primary antibody . Preimmunized rabbit serum was used as the control . Arrows indicate cells with positive RON staining ( brown color ) . Immunoreactive RON was localized as condensed granules in cytoplasm in cells at colorectal luminal surfaces ( a ) or at the bottom of crypt ( b ) . Panels c and d are the negative control for panels a and b , respectively . Magniﬁcation : ( a ) and ( c ) , (cid:1) 20 ; and ( b ) and ( d ) , (cid:1) 10 RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 187 Oncogene Immunoreactive RON was detected in all 49 tumor samples . Among these , 20 samples had RON expression at levels similar to those found in normal colorectal epithelia . The scores of these 20 samples were 3 ( seven cases ) , 4 ( eight cases ) , and 5 ( ﬁve cases ) with a mean score of 3 . 90 . Increased RON expression was found in 29 cases ( 59 . 2 % ) with scores of 6 ( seven cases ) , 7 ( 11 cases ) , and 8 ( 11 cases ) . The mean score of these 29 cases was 7 . 14 , which is signiﬁcantly higher than that from normal colon tissues . Representative results are shown in Figure 2 . Almost all cancerous cells were stained with anti - RON antibody . High levels of RON accumulation were found in samples characterized as highly or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas ( Figure 2a , b ) . Unlike its expression in normal colorectal mucosa , the RON protein was distributed in the cytoplasm of cancerous cells as a diffuse pattern . However , the granular staining pattern was often seen in tumors that express relatively normal levels of RON ( Figure 2c ) . A detailed analysis for correlation between the levels of RON expression and the degree of tumor differentiation was conducted , but the statistical signiﬁcance was not established . The correlation between the intensity of RON staining and clinicopathological parameters , including depth of invasion and vascular involvement , was not observed . Constitutive activation of RON in primary colorectal adenocarcinomas To determine if accumulated RON is constitutively active in vivo , cellular proteins from four frozen tumor samples were tested in the phosphotyrosine assay . These samples were from matched tumors with immunohisto - chemical scores of 7 – 8 . Two normal colon samples from nontumor operation were used as controls . RON was immunoprecipitated with mAb ID2 and detected in Western blotting with mAb 4G10 to phosphotyrosine . Results are shown in Figure 3 . Phosphorylated RON was detected in all four tumor samples ( Figure 3a , lanes 3 – 6 ) , although the levels of RON vary among these four samples ( Figure 3b ) . No phosphorylated RON was detected in control specimens ( Figure 3a , lanes 1 and 2 ) . These results indicate that the increased RON expres - sion in certain colorectal cancers is accompanied by constitutive phosphorylation in vivo . Figure 2 Overexpression of RON in primary human colorectal adenocarcinomas . The conditions for immunohistochemical staining were similar to those described in Figure 1 . RON was detected as a diffuse staining in the cytoplasm of cancerous cells that overexpress RON ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) . In contrast , granular staining was seen in tumors that express relatively normal levels of RON ( c ) . Tumors shown in panels a and b are pathologically diagnosed as well or poorly differentiated colorectal cancers , respectively . The intensity of the staining was strong in both cases . Shown in panel c is a tumor section incubated with control serum .

RON in tissues lysates of four tumors ( lanes 3 – 6 ) and two normal colon mucosal samples ( lanes 1 and 2 ) was immunoprecipitated with mAb ID2 and separated in 8 % SDS – PAGE under reduced conditions . Phosphorylated RON was detected by mAb 4G10 ( a ) . The same membrane was also reprobed with rabbit IgG to RON ( b ) . The difference in the amount of RON loaded in each lane is probably because of the variable amounts of epithelial cells in each tissue sample RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 188 Oncogene Identiﬁcation of RON variants expressed in primary colorectal carcinomas Our previous studies have found a novel RON variant in certain colon cancer cell lines such as HT29 ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . To determine if RON variants are generated in primary colorectal adenocarcinomas , tissue lysates prepared from 11 frozen tumor samples were analysed by Western blotting . The results are shown in Figure 4 . RON was expressed in all 11 tumor samples , mostly displayed as a 180 kDa single - chain pro - RON and a 145 kDa RON b chain ( derived from mature RON ) . However , in tumor samples CT34 and CT42 , three proteins with molecular mass at p165 , p155 , and p140 were detected by anti - RON antibody . Similar results were also obtained by using another anti - RON antibody that recognizes different regions of the RON protein ( data not shown ) . Owing to limited amounts of available samples , the phosphorylation assay was not performed . In contrast , RON variants were not detected in samples prepared from 5 - colorectal normal mucosa ( data not shown ) . Thus , the presence of these three different - sized proteins suggests that RON variants are produced in colorectal tumor samples CT34 and CT42 . Molecular cloning of RON variants from primary colorectal carcinomas To clone RON variants expressed in samples CT34 and CT42 , reversed transcription – polymerase chain reaction ( RT – PCR ) was performed using total RNA isolated from these two tumor samples . RNA from normal colorectal mucosa was used as controls . A pair of oligoprimers that cover the most extracellular regions ( from 1311 to 2919 ) of the RON b chain was designed . This region has been previously found containing deletions in exons 5 , 6 , and 11 ( Wang et al . , 2000 ; Collesi et al . , 1996 ) . Results from the RT – PCR analysis are shown in Figure 5 . A single 1 . 6 kb PCR fragment ( designated as CtR - 1 ) was ampliﬁed from tumor samples CT01 , 02 , 07 , 11 , 15 , 35 , 36 , 41 , and 43 . This fragment was also found in CT34 and CT42 . Interest - ingly , three additional cDNA fragments ( designated as CtR - 2 , 1 . 5 kb ; CtR - 3 , 1 . 3 kb ; and CtR - 4 , 1 . 1 kb , respectively ) were also ampliﬁed from CT34 or CT42 RNA sample . Results from DNA sequence analysis of the ampliﬁed PCR fragments are shown in Figure 6 . The sequences of CtR - 1 fragment are identical to those found in the wild - type ( wt ) RON b chain and contain no mutation or deletion . CtR - 2 , - 3 , and - 4 also encode the part of the RON b chain , but contain different in - frame deletions . CtR - 2 had a deletion of 147 nucleotides , which encodes 49 amino acids ; CtR - 3 had a deletion of 327 nucleotides , which encodes 109 amino acids ; and CtR - 4 had a combined deletion of 147 and 327 nucleotides . By comparison with genomic sequence of the RON gene ( Angeloni et al . , 2000 ) with the cloned fragment , it is clear that the deletion of 49 amino acids occurs at exon 11 . The deletion of 109 amino acids occurs at exons 5 and 6 . The deletion of 49 and 109 amino acids is the result of the combination of exons 5 , 6 , and 11 . This is a novel RON variant ( designated as RON D 155 , based on the calculated molecular weight ) that has not been discovered previously . These data demonstrated that the splicing of the RON mRNA at different regions occur in these two primary colorectal cancer samples , which results in the expression of different RON variants ( Figure 4 ) . Different expression patterns of RON variants in MDCK cells To study biological activities of three RON variants in more detail , the cDNA encoding RON D 165 , RON D 160 , or RON D 155 were constructed by replacing the corresponding fragment in the wtRON cDNA with the cloned CtR - 2 or CrR - 4 fragment , respectively . Structur - al differences among these three RON variants are illustrated in Figure 7 . Expression of the three RON variants was achieved by transfection of Martin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells with pcDNA3 . 1 expression vector . Results are shown in Figure 8 . In cells expressing wtRON , a 180 kDa single - chain pro - RON and a 145 kDa RON b chain were observed , indicating that pro - RON is converted into the two - chain form . How - ever , a single 165 kDa protein was seen in cells Figure 4 Expression of different RON variants in human color - ectal adenocarcinomas . Tissue lysates were prepared from 11 colorectal tumor specimens . Samples ( 35 m g / lane ) were separated on 8 % SDS – PAGE under reduced conditions . RON or its variants were detected by Western blotting with rabbit IgG to the C - terminal peptide of RON . The reaction was developed with ECL reagents and recorded on ﬁlm . The protein patterns in lanes CT34 and CT42 appear identical but different from the other lanes Figure 5 Ampliﬁcation of RON - variant cDNA fragments from primary colorectal carcinoma samples . RT – PCR was performed using a pair of oligoprimers covering nucleotides 1311 – 2919 . Four prominent bands , designated as CtR - 1 , - 2 , - 3 , and - 4 , with sizes of 1 . 6 , 1 . 5 , 1 . 3 , and 1 . 1kb , respectively , were ampliﬁed . A full length of RON cDNA was used as a positive control ( data not shown ) . All four fragments were isolated for DNA sequence analysis RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 189 Oncogene expressing RON D 165 , indicating that the protein is an uncleaved pro - RON D 165 protein ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ) . In cells expressing RON D 160 , two proteins were detected , one is the single - chain pro - RON D 160 and the other is the RON D 160 b chain , suggesting that pro - RON D 160 is proteolytically processed . In cells expres - sing RON D 155 , only a single protein with a molecular mass of 140 kDa was detected . The size of this protein is slightly smaller than the expected pro - RON D 155 . These results indicate that the proteolytic conversion occurs in RON variant RON D 160 , but not in RON D 165 and RON D 155 . The tyrosine phosphorylation assay was also per - formed conﬁrming that RON D 165 , RON D 160 , and RONp155 are autophosphorylated at tyroine residues , indicating that the three RON variants are G C G W C G N M C G Q Q K E C P G S W Q Q D H C ggc tgt ggc tgg tgt ggg aac atg tgc ggc cag cag aag gag tgt cct ggc tcc tgg caa cag gac cac tgc P P K L T E F H P H S G P L R G S T R L T L C G cca cct aag ctt act gag ttc cac ccc cac agt gga cct cta agg ggc agt aca agg ctg acc ctg tgt ggc ↑ E5 S N F Y L H P S G L V P E G T H Q V T V G Q S P tcc aac ttc tac ctt cac cct tct ggt ctg gtg cct gag gga acc cat cag gtc act gtg ggc caa agt ccc C R P L P K D S S K L R P V P R K D F V E E F E tgc cgg cca ctg ccc aag gac agc tca aaa ctc aga cca gtg ccc cgg aaa gac ttt gta gag gag ttt gag ↑ E6 ↑ E9 C E L E P L G T Q A V G P T N V S L T V T N M P tgt gaa ctg gag ccc ttg ggc acc cag gca gtg ggg cct acc aac gtc agc ctc acc gtg act aac atg cca P G K H F R V D G T S V L R G F S F M E P V L I ccg ggc aag cac ttc cgg gta gac ggc acc tcc gtg ctg aga ggc ttc tct ttc atg gag cca gtg ctg ata ↑ E7 A V Q P L F G P R A G G T C L T L E G Q S L S V gca gtg caa ccc ctc ttt ggc cca cgg gca gga ggc acc tgt ctc act ctt gaa ggc cag agt ctg tct gta G T S R A V L V N G T E C L L A R V S E G Q L L ggc acc agc cgg gct gtg ctg gtc aat ggg act gag tgt ctg cta gca cgg gtc agt gag ggg cag ctt tta ↑ E8 C A T P P G A T V A S V P L S L Q V G G A Q V P tgt gcc aca ccc cct ggg gcc acg gtg gcc agt gtc ccc ctt agc ctg cag gtg ggg ggt gcc cag gta cct G S W T F Q Y R E D P V V L S I S P N C G Y I N ggt tcc tgg acc ttc cag tac aga gaa gac cct gtc gtg cta agc atc agc ccc aac tgt ggc tac atc aac S H I T I C G Q H L T S A W H L V L S F H D G L tcc cac atc acc atc tgt ggc cag cat cta act tca gca tgg cac tta gtg ctg tca ttc cat gac ggg ctt R A V E S R C E R Q L P E Q Q L C R L P E Y V V agg gca gtg gaa agc agg tgt gag agg cag ctt cca gag cag cag ctg tgc cgc ctt cct gaa tat gtg gtc ↑ E10 R D P Q G W V A G N L S A R G D G A A G F T L P cga gac ccc cag gga tgg gtg gca ggg aat ctg agt gcc cga ggg gat gga gct gct ggc ttt aca ctg cct G F R F L P P P H P P S A N L V P L K P E E H A ggc ttt cgc ttc cta ccc cca ccc cat cca ccc agt gcc aac cta gtt cca ctg aag cct gag gag cat gcc I K F E Y I G L G A V A D C V G I N V T V G G E att aag ttt gag tat att ggg ctg ggc gct gtg gct gac tgt gtg ggt atc aac gtg acc gtg ggt ggt gag ↑ E11 S C Q H E F R G D M V V C P L P P S L Q L G Q D agc tgc cag cac gag ttc cgg ggg gac atg gtt gtc tgc ccc ctg ccc cca tcc ctg cag ctt ggc cag gat G A P L Q V C V D G E C H I L G R V V R P G P D ggt gcc cca ttg cag gtc tgc gta gat ggt gaa tgt cat atc ctg ggt aga gtg gtg cgg cca ggg cca gat ↑ E12 G V P Q S T L L G I L L P L L L L V A A L A T A ggg gtc cca cag agc acg ctc ctt ggt atc ctg ctg cct ttg ctg ctg ctt gtg gct gca ctg gcg act gca (cid:1) TM L V F S Y W W R R K Q L V L P P ctg gtc ttc agc tac tgg tgg cgg agg aag cag cta gtt ctt cct ccc TM (cid:1) ↑ E13 Figure 6 Partial nucleotide sequences of the RON cDNA fragments isolated from primary colorectal carcinomas .

The cysteine residues in the sequences are boxed . Exons are numbered at the ﬁrst nucleotide of each exon with an arrow . The beginning and the end of transmembrane domain ( TM ) are marked with open arrows RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 190 Oncogene constitutively active even without MSP stimulation ( data not shown ) . Scatter - like activities of MDCK cells expressing different RON variants To determine if RON variants exert biological func - tions , scatter - like activity was tested in transfected MDCK cells . Results are shown in Figure 9 . Control MDCK cells grew as clusters . Addition of MSP did not cause any cell scatter - like activity ( Figure 9a ) . In contrast , MDCK cells expressing wtRON displayed scatter - like activity after MSP stimulation ( Figure 9b ) . This effect was not seen when MSP was absent ( data not shown ) . Expression of RON D 160 or RON D 155 resulted in dramatic morphological change and scatter - like activity ( Figure 9c , d ) . Interestingly , these activities were also seen when MSP was not included in culture ( data not shown ) . Similarly , scatter activity was observed in cells expressing RON D 165 in the presence or absence of MSP ( data not shown ) , which is consistent with previously reported data ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ) . These results suggest that the three RON variants have the ability to mediate scattering - like activity in a ligand - independent manner . RON variant - mediated in vitro cell - transforming activities in NIH3T3 cells Previous studies have shown that the cDNA encoding wtRON or RON D p165 does not have cell - transforming activity when introduced into rodent ﬁbroblasts ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ; Santoro et al . , 1996 ) . To determine if cloned RON variants have the ability to transform cells in vitro , the focus - forming assay was performed using NIH3T3 cells as the indicator . The RON mutant ( M1254T ) , which is oncogenic in vivo ( Santoro et al . , 1998 ) , was used as the positive control . Results are shown in Figure 10 and Table 1 . Cells transfected with empty vector or wtRON did not produce the visible foci ( Figure 10a , b , Table 1 ) . In contrast , the M1254T mutant exerted strong focus - forming activity in NIH3T3 cells ( Figure 10c and Table 1 ) , which is consistent with previously reported results ( Santoro et al . , 1998 ) . To our surprise , RON D p160 and RON D 155 displayed cell - transforming activity ( Figure 10d and data not shown ) , although their activities were not as strong as the M1254T mutant ( Table 1 ) . The number and the size of foci in RON D 160 or RON D 155 expressed cells were less and smaller than those in cells expressing the M1254T mutant . We also tested RON variants in supporting ancho - rage - independent growth of NIH3T3 cells . Results are shown in Table 1 . Expression of RON D 160 or RON D 155 results in multiple colony formation when stable transfectants were grown in soft agar ; however , the numbers were much less than those produced by RON mutant M1254T . As expected , the colony was not observed in cells expressing wtRON .

Transfection of MDCK cells was performed as described ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . Cells expressing individual RON variants were obtained and expanded . Immunoprecipitation was done with 2mg cellular protein / sample using mAb ID2 . RON and the variants were detected by Western blotting with rabbit IgG to the C - terminal peptide of RON . Similar results were also obtained using other cell lines expressing RON variants ( data not shown ) RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 191 Oncogene in vitro to induce and sustain anchorage - independent growth of NIH3T3 cells . Oncogenic potentials of RON variants in vivo To determine if 3T3 cells expressing RON variants have abilities to form tumors in vivo , pooled stable transfected cells expressing individual RON variants were inocu - lated into nude mice and tumor formation was observed . The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 11 . Inoculation of control 3T3 cells did not produce any tumors in mice . Similarly , cells expressing wtRON did not form any tumors in ﬁve mice tested , which is consistent with a previous report ( Santoro et al . , 1998 ) . As expected , RON - M1254T cells formed large tumors in all ﬁve mice . To our surprise , tumors were found in all ﬁve nude mice injected with RON D 160 cells . Small tumors were also found in mice inoculated with RON D 155 cells . The days of tumor mass onset in these two groups of mice were slightly delayed in comparison with those in RON - M1254T mice . Also , the average size of tumors in RON D p160 and RON D 155 mice is smaller than that in RON - M1254T mice . These results demon - strated that the two naturally occurring RON variants have abilities to form tumor in nude mice in vivo . Metastatic potentials of RON variants in athymic nude mice To determine if cloned RON variants promote tumor metastasis , a model of experimental metastasis was used to test the ability of RON - variant - expressing cells to colonize and grow in the lungs of athymic nude mice . Results are shown in Table 3 . 3T3 cells transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 vector alone or expressing wtRON ( the negative control ) did not form any tumors in the lung within a 12 - week period . As expected , multiple tumors were observed in the lungs after injection of RON - M1254T cells into the tail vein of mice ( the positive control ) . However , tumors were observed in the lungs from mice injected with RON D 160 or RON D 155 cells . The frequencies of tumors in the lungs were relatively low in comparison with those found in mice injected with RON - M1254T cells . Nevertheless , these data suggest that cells expressing RON D 160 and RON D 155 have the ability to colonize and grow in the lungs of mice in the experimental metastasis model .

Cells were seeded at a density of 3 (cid:1) 10 3 per well . The colonies were counted 3 weeks later . Each value represents the averages ( 7 s . d . ) of three independent experiments performed in triplicate RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 192 Oncogene Discussion The central ﬁndings in this report are that RON expression is altered in the certain primary human colorectal adenocarcinomas ( 29 / 49 cases , 59 . 2 % ) . More - over , we identiﬁed three RON variants from two of 11 primary tumor samples . Molecular cloning conﬁrmed that RON variants are derived from abnormal mRNA splicing . All three RON variants , RON D 165 , RON D 160 , and RON D p155 , have the ability to induce cell scatter in a ligand - independent manner . They also have focus - forming activity when introduced into rodent ﬁbro - blasts . Results from the in vivo tumor formation assay further conﬁrmed that RON D 160 and RON D p155 have abilities to induce tumor formation and coloniza - tion in the lung in vivo . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst report showing that two naturally occurring human RON variants possess oncogenic activities . Thus , the current data , together with our previous published results ( Chen et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) , suggest that RON expression is deregulated not only in established colon cancer cell lines , but also in primary colorectal adenocarcinomas . The altered RON expression and generation of constitutively active RON variants might participate in the pathogenesis of Figure 10 In vitro cell - transforming activity of RON variants . The expression vector pMT2 containing individual RON variants under the control of the Major Late adenovirus promoter was used for transfection . Samples were tested in triplicate and experiments repeated twice . Colonies were counted 18 days later and normalized with transfection efﬁciency : ( a ) NIH3T3 cells transfected with empty pMT2 , ( b ) cells transfected with wtRON , ( c ) cells transfected with RON mutant M1254T , and ( d ) cells transfected with RON D p160 .

Differential RON expression has been found pre - viously in normal or malignant colorectal epithelia ( Montero - Julian et al . , 1998 ; Okino et al . , 1999 ) . Using colon epithelial cell lines , we have shown that RON is barely detectable in normal or SV - 40 transformed colorectal epithelial cells , but highly expressed in a panel of established colon carcinoma cell lines including Colo201 and HT29 ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) . The results from our current studies show that RON is moderately expressed in normal colorectal mucosa with a distinct granular staining pattern . This expression pattern was conﬁrmed using three anti - RON antibodies that recog - nize different domains in the RON protein . In contrast , high levels of RON expression were found in 29 / 49 primary colorectal carcinoma samples . The intensity of the staining was quite high in certain cases ( Figure 2 ) . The most striking feature found in immunohistochem - ical staining is that RON is universally distributed in cancerous cells with diffused cytoplasmic staining . At present , the signiﬁcance in changing expression patterns between normal and malignant colon tissues is un - known . Nevertheless , these in vivo ﬁndings are consis - tent with our previous in vitro results ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) , suggesting that RON expression is altered in certain primary colorectal adenocarcinomas . Such changes might have a signiﬁcant implication in the progression of colorectal cancers in vivo . It needs to point out that our current data differ from a report published previously ( Okino et al . , 1999 ) , in which a commercial anti - RON antibody was used in detecting RON expression in colon tissue samples . It was shown that RON is normally expressed in cells at the bottom of the crypt and heterogeneously distributed in cancerous cells without overexpression ( Okino et al . , 1999 ) . The discrepancies between these two sets of results are , we believe , the antibody used for the studies . Our experience is that this commercial antibody behaves differently with high reactivity with smooth muscles ( our unpublished data ) . By comparing with our three polyclonal antibodies , this commercial antibody pro - duced different staining patterns . Therefore , whether the results obtained from using this commercial antibody truly reﬂect RON expression in colorectal tissues require further investigation . Identiﬁcation and cloning of three RON variants , RON D 165 , RON D 160 , and RON D 155 , from two color - ectal adenocarcinoma samples are important with regard to the pathogenesis of RON in colorectal cancer . RON D 165 has been previously found in normal color - ectal mucosa and in tumor cells ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ; Okino et al . , 1999 ) , suggesting that it may not be involved in tumorigenesis of colorectal epithelia ( Collesi et al . , 1996 , Okino et al . , 1999 ) . Results from previous studies and our current experiments indicate that this might be the case . RON D 160 was ﬁrst cloned from the established colon tumor cell line HT29 ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . Now we show that this RON variant is also present in primary colorectal tumors . RON D 160 has the ability to induce cell scattering , transformation , and tumor formation in nude mice , suggesting that this altered receptor might play an important role in regulating transforming / motile - invasive phenotypes . RON D p155 is a novel RON variant that has not been reported previously . It induces cell scattering , transfor - mation , and tumor growth in vivo , although its efﬁciency is relatively low . RT – PCR and Western blot analyses did not ﬁnd this RON variant in samples derived from ﬁve normal colorectal mucosa . It seems that a unique mRNA splicing mechanism ( s ) is involved in the proces - sing of RON in some colorectal tumors . Biochemical and biological properties of the cloned three RON variants are different ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . 2000 ) . Detailed analysis of RON D 165 has been reported ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ) . RON D 165 has an in - frame deletion of 49 amino acids in the extracellular domain of the b chain , which was encoded by exon 11 . The deletion prevents the proteolytic process of pro - RON D 165 and retains the protein in the cytoplasm ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , the deletion of 109 amino acids , which are encoded by exons 5 and 6 , did not affect the conversion of pro - RON D 160 into the two - chain form ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . The mature RON D 160 protein is located on the cell surface and interacts with ligand MSP ( Chen et al . , 2000 , Wang et al . , 2000 ) . RON D 155 is the product of a unique spliced RON mRNA that has the combined deletion of exons 5 , 6 , and 11 . RON D 155 is present as a single - chain precursor in transfected cells . Currently , it is unknown whether RON D 155 is located on the cell surface or inside the cytoplasm . Biochemically , all three RON variants are constitutively active . The autophosphorylation is prob - ably caused by deletions that result in unbalanced cystine residues in the extracellular domain of the RON b chain leading to abnormal dimerization ( Collesi et al . , 1996 , Chen et al . , 2000 ) . The three RON variants also Figure 11 RON variants - mediated tumor formation in athymic nude mice . NIH 3T3 cells transfected with empty pMT2 vector , or cDNA encoding wtRON , RONM1254T , RONp155 , or RONp160 , respectively , were used for inoculation . Five groups of mice , each with 5 animals , were used . Cells ( 1 (cid:1) 10 6 cells ) in 0 . 2 ml PBS were subcutaneously injected into the posterior ﬂank of female nude mice . The mice were checked daily for tumor formation at the site of inoculation . Mice that did not form tumors were observed for up to 8 weeks . Latency was determined as the period of time required for tumor to reach a diameter of 15 mm RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 194 Oncogene have the ability to induce spontaneous cell - scattering and migrating activities in a ligand - independent manner ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 2000 , and Figure 9 ) . Clearly , the generation of the three RON variants , parti - cularly RONp160 and RON D 155 , provides a molecular mechanism for post - transcriptional activation of RON in primary colorectal adenocarcinomas . Since the abnormal activation of RON led to cell migration , dissociation , and invasion ( Santoro et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) , it is reasonable to think that RON variants , like RON D 160 , might play a critical role in regulating motile - invasive phenotypes in certain colorectal carcinomas . The ﬁnding that RON D 160 and RON D 155 have the ability to cause multiple foci in transfected NIH3T3 cells and to induce tumor formation in athymic nude mice is a surprise . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst naturally occurring human RON variants that have cell - trans - forming and tumor - growth activities . In contrast , mouse wtRON , also known as STK ( Iwama et al . , 1994 ) , has the ability to induce tumor formation in vivo ( Peace et al . , 2001 ) . Human wtRON or RON D 165 has never showed cell transformation and tumor - formation activities ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ; Santoro et al . , 1996 , 1998 ; Williams et al . , 1999 ) , instead , it induces the motile - invasive phenotypes ( Collesi et al . , 1996 ; Santoro et al . , 1996 ) . However , human RON has oncogenic potential . Two reports have showed that the oncogenic forms of RON could be artiﬁcially created by point mutations at the RON kinase domain ( Santoro et al . , 1998 ; Williams et al . , 1999 ) . The ﬁnding that RON D 160 and RON D 155 have cell - transforming activities is important for the following reasons : ( 1 ) Both RON variants were only found in established colon cancer cell line and in certain primary colorectal carcinomas , and not in normal colorectal mucosa ( ﬁve samples tested ) . Thus , the generation of RON D 160 or RON D 155 is a speciﬁc event occurring at colorectal tumors , but not at normal mucosa . ( 2 ) RON D 160 and RON D 155 were constitutively active , which led to increased cell scatter - ing ( Figure 9 ) , migration , and matrix invasion ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , they have the ability to transduce signals that activate the motile machinery of the cells , which could play an important role in promoting in vivo the invasive phenotype . ( 3 ) The generation of RON variant with transforming activity by the RON gene may have a profound impact on the physiology of colorectal epithelia , and may also represent a unique mechanism for RON in the pathogenesis of certain colorectal carcinomas . Therefore , it will be of great interest in the future to determine if RON D p160 is a critical player in vivo in the pathogenesis of colorectal adenocarcinomas . Targeted expression of RON D p160 or RON D p155 in colorectal tissues using transgenic techniques will be worth trying . Materials and methods Colorectal tissue specimens A total of 49 parafﬁn - embedded colorectal adenocarcinoma specimens and nine normal colon mucosa samples ( 39 males and 19 females , aged 23 – 81 years with a mean age of 60 . 1 ) were obtained from the Department of Pathology . Among the 49 ﬁxed tumor samples , 24 cases were well differentiated , 14 cases moderately differentiated , and 11 cases poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas . Normal colon mucosa samples were obtained from noncancer surgical operation . Frozen colorectal samples ( 11 tumors and ﬁve adjacent mucosa ) were also obtained and used for isolation of RNA and cellular protein . Cells and reagents NIH3T3 cells were from ATCC ( Rockville , MD , USA ) . RE7 is a clone of MDCK cells transfected with the RON cDNA ( Wang et al . , 1994a ) . MSP was provided by Dr EJ Leonard ( National Cancer Institute , Frederick , MD , USA ) . RON mutant cDNA ( M1254T ) ( Santoro et al . , 1998 ) was from Dr G Gaudino ( Universita di Torino , Novara , Italy ) . Mouse mAb to RON ( clone ID2 ) and rabbit IgG antibodies to the extracellular domain or the C - terminal peptide of RON were as described ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . Mouse mAb 4G10 to phosphotyrosine was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc . ( Lake Placid , NY , USA ) . ECL detection reagents were from Amersham - Pharmacia ( Arlington Heights , IL , USA ) . RT - PCR and DNA sequencing Total RNA was isolated from 16 frozen colon tissues using TRIzol ( Life Technologies ) . RT was carried out using 3 m g RNA with a SuperScript Preampliﬁcation Kit ( Life Technol - ogies ) . PCR was performed as described ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) using a pair of oligoprimer ( 5 0 - TGGTCAGTAGCAGCTTCT - CA - 3 0 and 5 0 - AGGCAGCAGGATACCAAGGA - 3 0 ) . The primers were designed to amplify the coding sequences from nucleotides 1311 to 2919 that cover the extracellular regions of the RON b chain ( Ronsin et al . , 1993 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) . PCR fragments were isolated using Qiagen PCR Extraction Kit ( QIAGEN Inc . , Santa Clarita , CA , USA ) . Double - stranded DNA sequencing was performed at the University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA Sequence Core Facility . Construction of RON variant cDNA and transfection in MDCK cells The cDNA encoding RON D 165 or RON D p155 was generated by replacing the corresponding fragment in the wtRON cDNA with the cloned PCR fragment that contains 147 or 147 + 327 nucleotide deletion . The cDNA encoding RON D 160 was used as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . Transfection of MDCK cells with pcDNA3 . 1 ( Invitrogen ) containing RON variant cDNA was performed as described previously ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . Cells were selected with 800 m g / ml of G418 and expanded into cell lines . RON variant expression was determined by Western blotting using rabbit anti - RON IgG . Immunohistochemical staining and data evaluation Tissue sections ( 4 m m thick ) were dewaxed , rehydrated , and then placed in 10 m m Tris buffer , pH 7 . 40 , containing 150 m m NaCl , 1 % BSA , and 0 . 02 Tween 20 . Sections were treated with 0 . 3 % hydroxide in H 2 O for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activities and then incubated with preimmunized normal rabbit serum for 60min . Rabbit anti - RON serum ( dilution : 1 : 500 ) was used as primary antibody . RE7 cells were used as positive controls . The reaction was developed with EnVison + Sys ( DAKO Corp . , Carpinteria , CA , USA ) and visualized with diaminobenzidine as substrate . The levels of RON expression were assessed using a semiquantitative scoring system ( Allred et al . , 1998 ) . This system is the sum RON variates in colon cancers Y - Q Zhou et al 195 Oncogene of a proportion score and an intensity score . The proportion score is an estimate of the proportion of positive cells on the entire slide and is divided into the following categories : 0 , no cells stained ; 1 , less than 1 % ; 2 , 1 – 10 % ; 3 , 11 – 33 % ; 4 , 34 – 67 % ; and 5 , more than 67 % . The intensity score estimates the average staining intensity of positive tumor cells : 0 , negative ; 1 , weak ; 2 , moderate ; and 3 , intense . The combined score system ranges from 0 to 8 . A combined score of 6 or more was considered positive for RON overexpression . Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting Tissue or cell samples were homogenized in lysis buffer as described previously ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) . Equal amounts of cellular proteins were mixed with a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) ID2 ( 1 m g ) coupled with protein G - Sepharose beads . Samples were separated in an 8 % polyacrylamide gel under reduced conditions and transferred to Immobilon - P membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , USA ) . Western blotting was performed with rabbit IgG to the C - terminal peptide of RON or mAb 4G10 , followed by goat anti - rabbit or mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase . The reaction was developed with enhanced chemiluminescent reagents and recorded on ﬁlm . Assays for cell - scatter - like activity The assays were performed as described previously ( Xiao et al . , 2000 ) . To determine scatter - like activity , cells at 1 (cid:1) 10 5 cells / well were incubated in culture dish overnight and then stimulated with or without 5n m MSP for 24 h . Cells were stained with crystal violet and photographed . Cell transformation assays The focus - forming assay was performed as described ( Santoro et al . , 1998 ) with slight modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , NIH3T3 cells ( 4 (cid:1) 10 5 cells / dish ) were transfected with 10 m g pMT2 vector containing cDNA encoding wtRON , RON D 165 , RON D 160 , or RON - M1254T , respectively . After a 24 - h incubation , cells were split at low density into 100 mm - diameter dishes and incubated in DMEM with 5 % FBS . One plate was used for focus formation and another for selection of stable tansfec - tants . Cells were cultured at conﬂuence and screened for focus formation 18 days later . For the anchorage - independent growth assay , stable transfectants were pooled from each transfection . Cells at 2 (cid:1) 10 5 in 2ml DMEM with 5 % FBS were seeded in a 35 - mm - diameter culture dish containing a 1 % agarose underlayer . New medium was added every 4 ays and colonies were scored after 20 days following staining with crystal violet in solution . In vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis assays These assays were performed as previously described ( Santoro et al . , 1998 ; Peace et al . , 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , pooled NIH3T3 cells transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 vector alone or with cDNA encoding wtRON , RON - M1254T , RON D 160 , and RON D 155 , respectively , were harvested from culture dishes and suspended in 0 . 2ml serum - free DMEM prior to injection . In the tumorigenesis assay , cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the posterior ﬂank of athymic nude mice ( ﬁve mice per group ) . The tumor formation was monitored daily . The latency was determined as the period of time required by tumors to reach a diameter of 10 – 15 mm . The mice that did not form tumors were observed for additional 8 weeks . For the lung coloniza - tion assay , cells were injected intravenously into the tail vein of athymic nude mice . Mice were killed 12 weeks postinjection . Tumors from skin or lungs were excised , ﬁxed with formalin , embedded in parafﬁn , and sectioned in 5 m m . The sections were stained with hematoxylin / eosin and evaluated by light micro - scope for histological examination .
