Optimal Parallel and Sequential Prototyping in Product Design Ely Dahan Sloan School of Management Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge , MA 02142 - 1347 Haim Mendelson Graduate School of Business Stanford University Stanford , CA 94305 - 5015 October 1998 Optimal Parallel and Sequential Prototyping in Product Design Optimal Parallel and Sequential Prototyping in Product Design AbstractAbstract When designing a new product , developers must balance the expected profit of improving the design against the cost and time requirements of doing so . We investigate this tradeoff by modeling the prototyping stage of product development as a probabilistic search process . We study optimal policies for single - period and infinite - horizon problems and derive closed - form solutions for the case of profits distributed according to the three extreme - value distributions . We demonstrate the role played by the tail - shape parameter of the distribution in determining the level and form of experimentation . The effect of declining prototype costs on expected profits , number of experiments , and spending is shown to depend on the form of the profit distribution and its tail - shape parameter . The paper compares the performance of pure parallel , pure sequential and hybrid parallel - sequential experimentation policies . 1 Optimal Parallel and Sequential Prototyping in Product Design Optimal Parallel and Sequential Prototyping in Product Design 1 . 1 . IntroductionIntroduction Prototyping provides valuable information to designers about the customer utility , technical feasibility and cost of a new product . A customer - ready prototype enables designers to discover problems and reveal opportunities that might have been overlooked in the design ’ s conceptual phase . One of the most challenging decisions facing design teams is allocating resources to tasks such as prototyping and testing , since their payoffs are highly uncertain . We consider four modes of prototyping , which are summarized in Table 1 : • One - shot : The design team builds and tests only one prototype , consistent with a “ Do it right the first time ” philosophy . • Sequential : The design team builds and tests one prototype each period , for as many periods as are necessary to achieve a “ good enough ” design . • Parallel : The design team builds and tests multiple prototypes in a single period , then chooses the most profitable one . • Hybrid : The design team builds and tests multiple prototypes each period , for as many periods as are necessary to achieve a “ good enough ” design . 2 Table 1 : Prototyping Modes Time - Frame One period One period MultiperiodMultiperiod 1 One - shot Pure Sequential Prototypes per period M a n y PureParallel Hybrid ( Parallel and Sequential ) The one - shot prototyping approach conforms to the common wisdom that freezing design specifications early improves profits by coordinating the efforts of the functional areas of the firm , minimizing costly redesign iterations and speeding time - to - market . Given low technical and market risks , the one - shot mode maximizes design efficiency . Figure 1 Research demand and product cost Determine the market opportunity Select the “ best bet ” concepton the short list Launchproduct YES NO Build the “ best bet ” Satisfies cost and market require - ments ? Consider all possible product ideas Narrow to a short list of the best ideas Figure 1 depicts the sequential mode of search . After researching the market and technology , a large number of product ideas are considered and narrowed down to a short list of leading concepts worthy of testing , as described by Ulrich and Eppinger ( 1995 ) . The concepts on the short list are then ranked according to a process that includes competitive benchmarking , Pugh concept selection and similar structured methodologies . Next the “ best bet ” alternative is chosen as the first step in the search . This design alternative is prototyped and tested to see if it satisfies internal 3 requirements for market demand , manufacturing cost and technical feasibility prior to being launched . An iterative process of improvement ensues until an observed outcome meets or exceeds the internally imposed profit hurdle . For products with long design cycles , the sequential - iteration approach is effective . However , an optimal prototyping policy should consider not only development cost and product performance , which favor sequential prototyping , but also the benefits of faster time - to - market , which favor parallelism . Due to shrinking product life cycles and competitive pressure , the design team may need to accelerate the process of testing promising prototypes ( c . f . Fine 1998 , Mendelson and Pillai 1998 ) . An empirical study by McKinsey claimed that the penalty for being six months late in releasing a new product is about a third of overall profits [ Vesey 1991 ] . Products such as Internet software , computers , pharmaceuticals , semiconductors and even movies , to name only a few , demand urgency in their design and development . The expression “ time is money ” is literally true in these situations . Accelerating clockspeed increases demand for parallel prototyping since product development is speeded up as shown in Figure 2 . As before , the market and technology are researched , and then a plethora of ideas within the product category are considered . In the parallel mode , however , leading design concepts need not be narrowed to a single best concept . The design team decides how many parallel prototypes to build by balancing the cost of prototyping against the benefit of expected profit enhancement , given a single period in which to conduct experiments . After prototyping , the firm launches the design with the highest profit projection or abandons launch if even the best design is projected to lose money . 4 Figure 2 Prototype A . . .

Determinethe market opportunity Build and test n prototypes in parallel from the short list Determine the prototype with the highest projected profit Launchproduct p > 0 Abandonproduct p £ 0 Consider all possible product ideas Narrow to a short list of the best ideas On the supply side , declining prototyping costs improve the economics of parallel prototyping . Virtual and rapid prototyping techniques portend dramatic declines in the cost per prototype . Virtual prototypes , such as those employed by Boeing for its 777 aircraft , allow design concepts to be tested without the expense and time requirements of physical prototyping . When distributed over the World Wide Web , using formats such as VRML ( virtual reality markup language ) or streaming video , virtual prototypes allow potential customers to experience the “ look and feel ” of new designs before physical versions are built [ c . f . Dahan and Srinivasan 1998 ] . Preference and demand data may be collected efficiently in this way . Combinatorial prototyping methods [ Thomke , et . al . 1997 ] enable researchers to efficiently search through thousands of variations of custom - designed chemical compounds , to see , for example , which metallic oxide is the best superconductor or which organic compound is the most pharmacologically active . Rapid prototyping allows computer - controlled technology to create topologically complex physical prototypes using layering and etching techniques in place of traditional methods such as machining and casting . The economics of getting “ from art to ( prototyped ) part ” continue to improve , making parallelism more affordable . 5 In summary , the attractiveness of parallel prototyping is enhanced by the increased importance of time - to - market , the steady decline in prototyping costs , and the availability of new prototyping technologies . Prior research related to sequential and parallel prototyping can be broadly divided into three categories : ( 1 ) models of search , ( 2 ) prototyping processes , and ( 3 ) R & D projects as real options . Models from the broad literature on optimal search provide insight into the economics of prototyping . Weitzman [ 1979 ] develops an optimal solution to the problem of sequential experimentation under uncertainty , but does not consider parallel search . This is natural in the context of his analysis , since when individuals search for low prices or high - paying jobs , parallel search is not feasible . Weitzman ’ s optimal policy ranks uncertain alternatives by their reservation prices , which depend on the reward distribution and cost of search . Weitzman orders the experiments and delineates the optimal stopping rule for a pure sequential policy ( discussed in section 3 . 1 ) . Morgan and Manning [ 1985 ] study the optimization of sequential and parallel search policies and prove that a hybrid parallel / sequential policy dominates both pure policies . Gross [ 1972 ] extols the wisdom of developing multiple advertising campaigns and develops a one - period model of optimal parallel search incorporating residual uncertainty after the advertising campaigns are designed and tested . The number of parallel concepts to be tested is determined heuristically . Srinivasan , Lovejoy , and Beach [ 1997 ] provide empirical evidence that parallel prototyping resolves some of the residual uncertainty remaining after the concept phase of product design . They show that , under reasonable assumptions , parallel prototyping 6 is more profitable than the one - shot approach and propose parallel development of customer - ready prototypes as an attractive method of reducing risk . A second line of research suggests that parallel prototyping requires appropriate processes , resources , and organizational structure . In a rapidly changing market environment , the design process must facilitate high - speed , high - performance innovation . Smith and Reinertson [ 1995 ] emphasize the importance of speeding up new product development and suggest parallelism as one method for doing so . Leonard - Barton [ 1995 ] coins the term “ failing forward ” to describe experimentation in which firms learn from failures and take advantage of the creativity inherent in highly variable experimental outcomes . Wheelwright and Clark [ 1992 ] discuss the positive and negative organizational implications of having internal teams compete to design the same new product . Thomke , Von Hippel , and Franke [ 1997 ] demonstrate how new prototyping technology facilitates parallel search . They cite , as an example , combinatorial chemistry in which pharmaceutical firms conduct large numbers of parallel experiments in the search for new drugs . The third line of research suggests that multiple prototypes be viewed as real options . Hauser [ 1996 ] provides a comprehensive annotated bibliography on valuing R & D projects , including research on their real options nature . For example , Hauser and Zettelmeyer [ 1997 ] characterize optimal policies for managing R & D portfolios and show the value of the options provided by alternative solutions to a given problem , even if the alternatives come from R & D spillovers from outside firms . This paper analyzes parallel - and sequential prototyping in new product development , modeling how time - to - market , prototyping mode and cost impact expected profit . We develop optimal policies for parallel and sequential prototyping , show how the parameters and form of the profit distribution drive the optimal policy , and evaluate 7 the real option to abandon launch . We also specify a hybrid policy that optimizes time and resource tradeoffs . We find that the shape of the upper tail of the profit distribution , whether bounded , exponential , or fat - tailed , is a key driver . In short , the degree of uncertainty about upside profit potential determines the optimal level of experimentation and degree of parallelism . The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows . In section 2 we study optimal parallel prototyping . Section 3 develops optimal hybrid policies that include parallel and sequential experiments . Section 4 concludes with a discussion of the results and managerial implications . 2 . 2 . Parallel prototyping Parallel prototyping 2 . 1 . The Model 1 Assume the profit resulting from a single prototype is a random variable , X , with cumulative distribution function F ( x ) and a continuous probability density function f ( x ) . X includes the net present value of incremental gross profits resulting from launching the new product , net of all costs other than the prototyping costs themselves . Hence , X captures the uncertainty about market risk , technology risk , and management risk . The parameters of the profit distribution derive from prior research on the market , technology , and competition facing the firm . This front - end process employs methods such as voice of the customer , target costing , lead user analysis , benchmarking , conjoint analysis , quality function deployment , parametric analysis and the like ( c . f . Dahan [ 1997 ] ) . 1 Model notation is summarized in Appendix A . 8 Profit outcomes for a firm developing n prototypes are modeled as independent draws from F ( x ) . Actually , this assumption can be relaxed . If outcomes are statistically dependent due to common additive factors , then it is sufficient to assume that , conditioning on the common factors , the residual profits are independent . In that case the profit distribution shifts , but the optimal parallel policy ( ignoring the option to abandon ) remains the same . Prototypes cost c each and deducting the total cost of prototyping , c n · , from gross profit determines net profit . The number of parallel prototypes , n , is treated as a continuous decision variable ( even though it would be integer - valued in actuality ) . 2 . 2 . Optimal Parallel Prototyping We focus on pure parallel prototyping within a single period . When a tight development window limits the firm to one prototyping cycle , a single period model of pure parallel search fits . The firm decides on n * , the optimal number of prototypes to build and test so as to maximize expected profit . After the profit outcomes for each of the n prototypes is revealed , the firm launches the one with the highest profit as its new product . The cumulative distribution function of the maximum of n independent prototypes is [ ] n x F ) ( , and the corresponding density function is [ ] 1 ) ( ) ( - (cid:215) (cid:215) n x F x f n . Given that the prototype with the maximum observed profit is launched , the expected profit from building and testing n prototypes , is given by ( 1 ) [ ] [ ] n c dx x f x F x n E n n (cid:215) - (cid:215) (cid:215) = (cid:242) ¥ ¥ - - ) ( ) ( 1 p . 9 When the objective function ( 1 ) is strictly concave in n , the globally optimal number of prototypes , n * , is determined by differentiating [ ] E n p with respect to n and solving the first order condition , ( 2 ) [ ] [ ] c dx x f x F x x F n n = (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) + (cid:215) (cid:242) ¥ ¥ - - ) ( ) ( 1 ) ( ln 1 , which equates the marginal benefit of the n th draw with its marginal cost . We note that the solution to equation ( 2 ) depends on the ratio between c and the scale of X , hence n * does not change when X and c are both scaled by a constant . The optimality condition implies : ( 3 ) ( ) ( ) * ) ] ( [ ) ( * * ] ) ( * [ ] ) , ( * [ * * * n c c E c c n n c n E c c c n E n n n - = ¶ ¶ + ¶ ¶ (cid:215) ¶ ¶ = ¶ ¶ p p p , since ( ) 0 ] ) ( * [ * = ¶ ¶ n c n E n p at * n . Since 0 * > n for any prototyping experiment worth running , 0 ] [ * < ¶ ¶ c E n p , so equation ( 3 ) demonstrates that a ( small ) reduction in unit prototyping cost impacts profit by n * , the number of prototypes . That is , if the cost for each prototype is cut by one dollar , and if n * remains ( approximately ) the same , the overall cost reduction will be n * . 2 . 2 . 1 . Real Option When the option to abandon product launch is not available , equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) apply . But if the profit distribution , F ( x ) , allows negative outcomes ( i . e . , losses ) , then even the best of n * draws may be negative , an event that occurs with probability * ) 0 ( n F . In that instance , the firm benefits from having the option to abandon product launch . The option to abandon may not be available if : ( a ) the firm is contractually 10 obligated to deliver , ( b ) the product is a required component of a larger system , or ( c ) the firm pre - announced launch , thus creating an implicit contract with its customers . Also , personal incentives on the part of individual decision - makers may preclude the abandonment option from being exercised , even when that choice might be optimal for the firm . In cases where potential losses are small or unlikely , the option to abandon is virtually worthless , in which case early commitment to launch may provide a competitive advantage . When the option to abandon is available , the expected profit from building and testing n prototypes improves compared with the no - option case ( i . e . the option value is non - negative ) . The expected profit from n prototypes given the option to abandon , ] [ optionn E p , is given by : ( 4 ) [ ] n c dx x f x F x n n c X X E E n n optionn (cid:215) - (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) = (cid:215) - = (cid:242) ¥ - 0 1 * 1 ) ( ) ( ) ] , . . . , , 0 [ max ( ] [ p . The value of the abandonment option , given that the firm develops n prototypes , is given by the difference between ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) [ ] [ ] [ ] (cid:242) ¥ - - (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) - = - 0 1 ) ( ) ( dx x f x F n x E E n n optionn p p , which is the mean minimum loss , given that all n outcomes are negative , weighted by the corresponding probability of that event . In other words , the option value is the probability - weighted loss that is being avoided since the firm is not forced to launch . Clearly , the option value at the optimum requires a comparison of ] [ * * option n E p and ] [ * n E p , where n * * maximizes ( 4 ) . The difference between the two is higher than in expression ( 5 ) with * n n = since * n maximizes ( 1 ) , but is only a feasible solution to ( 4 ) . Hence , ( ) ( ) ( ) option option n n n E E E * * * * p p p £ £ . 11 2 . 3 . Product Design and Extreme Value Theory This section applies the statistical theory of extreme values to product development . F ( x ) , which characterizes prototype profit uncertainty , is determined by the process of concept generation depicted in the first two boxes of Figure 2 . As described in chapter 5 of Ulrich and Eppinger ( 1995 , p . 78 ) , “ an effective development team will generate hundreds of concepts , of which 5 to 20 will merit serious consideration during the concept selection activity . ” Hence , we model F ( x ) as a distribution over product concepts , each of which is the maximum of a larger subset of product possibilities . In addition , as shown in the previous section , the value of the prototype chosen for launch is the maximum of the sample of prototype outcomes . When the maximum is taken over a large number of i . i . d . random variables , its asymptotic distribution is given by extreme value theory ( Gumbel ( 1958 ) , Galambos ( 1978 ) ) . The following theorem summarizes the pertinent results . Theorem Theorem 11 : : [ Galambos 1978 ] : Let H ( x ) be a distribution function from which m independent draws are taken . Then ) ( lim x H m m ¥ ﬁ , the limiting distribution of the maximum of m draws from H ( x ) , converges to one of three distributions ( with properly chosen m a and m b ) or to none at all : ( 6 ) a - - - (cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) = m b x x e x F m I 0 ) ( iff a - = - - ¥ ﬁ x t H tx H t ) ( 1 ) ( 1 lim for some ) , 0 ( ¥ ˛ a , ( 7 ) a (cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - = m b x x e x F m II 0 ) ( iff a x t x H tx x H t = - - - - ﬁ ) ( 1 ) ( 1 lim 0 0 0 for some ) , 0 ( ¥ ˛ a , or 12 ( 8 ) m b m a x e e x F m III - - - = ) ( iff x e t H t xR t H - = - + - ) ( 1 ) ) ( ( 1 lim where (cid:242) ¥ - - = t dx x H t H t R ) ( 1 ) ( 1 1 ) ( . We assume that H ( x ) , the underlying profit distribution for the universe of possible design ideas , satisfies one of the limits in ( 6 ) - ( 8 ) . Since product ideas that are good enough to make it onto Figure 2 ’ s “s hort list ” are each a maximum from a large sample drawn from H ( x ) , F ( x ) takes the form of one of the three extreme - value distributions . Appendix B summarizes the three extreme value distributions , provides their means and variances , and illustrates their unique property of closedness under maximization , which states that the highest of n draws from III II I i x F i , , ) , ( = is also distributed ) ( x F i with modified parameters . Appendix C summarizes the appropriate limit tests and distribution parameters connecting a given underlying distribution to its limiting extreme value distribution . The three extreme value distributions can be unified under a single , continuous model , ( 9 ) a a - + - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) = x e x F 1 ) ( [ von Mises 1936 ] , where the distribution is Frechet if 0 > a , Weibull if 0 < a , and Gumbel as ¥ ﬁ a . This last fact suggests that for sufficiently large a , the optimal parallel prototyping results for the Gumbel distribution apply broadly . The parameter a captures essential information about the upper tail of the profit distribution . Our analysis reveals that lower absolute values of a lead to widely different optimal policies . The extreme - value distributions , normalized to zero mean and unit variance , are shown in Figure 3 and interpreted in the context of new product development below . We note 13 the pronounced variation in the upper quantiles of three normalized distributions , as exemplified by the 99th - percentile stars in Figure 3 . Figure 3 : Densities for the three extreme value distributions ( m = 0 , s 2 = 1 ) - 3 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 1 . 0 0 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 Profit Frechet Gumbel Weibull , , and 0 > a ¥ ﬁ a 0 < a 99th % - ile of Weibull , Gumbel and Frechet , respectively • Weibull : Some firms face predictably finite bounds on the upside profit potential of a new product due to limited market potential , price ceilings , or fixed price contracts . Such might be the case for a product that serves a small market , upgrades an existing user base , conforms to a fixed - price contract , or is capacity - constrained . When the gross profit is upper - bounded , the Weibull distribution applies . The gross profits from each prototype are distributed over an interval ] , [ 0 x - ¥ , where 0 0 > x . • Gumbel : In many industries , there are no specific limits on the gross profit potential from a new product , but profit outcomes outside of a central range are extremely unlikely . Established products such as automobiles , food staples or commodities are not narrowly constrained by production capacity or market potential limits , but nevertheless tend towards somewhat predictable profit performance . When gross profit is 14 unbounded from above , but with steeply declining probability density , a distribution with exponential tails is appropriate . The Gumbel distribution is the asymptotic distribution for the maximum of multiple draws from exponential - tailed distributions such as the normal . • Frechet : Consider a product category with great upside uncertainty such as pharmaceuticals or new mass - market consumer durables . In such cases , products may become “ mega - hits , ” accounting for the vast majority of the firm ’ s profits . This may be due to network externality and dominant design effects , resulting in random variables that may be highly correlated in their effect on profit . When the gross profit distribution has a fat tail ( e . g . when F ( x ) declines as a - x ) , the Frechet distribution applies with higher values of a denoting “ thinner ” upper tails . The gross profits from each prototype are then distributed over an interval ] , [ 0 ¥ x . As shown in Appendix B the Frechet distribution has infinite mean when 1 0 £ < a . Hence , we assume throughout that 1 > a . We next evaluate ( 1 ) - ( 5 ) and obtain closed form solutions for n * for the Frechet , Weibull and Gumbel distributions . 2 . 4 . Optimal Parallel Prototyping for the Three Extreme Value Distributions 2 . 4 . 1 . Frechet Distribution For the Frechet distribution , equation ( 1 ) becomes ( 10 ) [ ] c n dx e b x x x b n E x b x x n (cid:215) - (cid:247) ł (cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - (cid:215) = (cid:242) ¥ (cid:247) ł (cid:246) (cid:231) Ł (cid:230) - - - - - 0 0 1 0 a a a p , which is maximized when 15 ( 11 ) 1 1 * - œßø ŒºØ (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - = G a a a a a c b n . Since [ ] 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 < (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) (cid:215) - = ¶ ¶ - - G - a a a a a a p n b n E n for all 1 > a , ] [ n E p is strictly concave and n * is globally optimal . As mentioned in the context of equation ( 2 ) , it is the ratio of profit scale , b , to experimentation cost , c , that drives n * . Thus , scaling b and c by the same constant in equation ( 11 ) leaves n * unchanged . Also , 0 * < ¶ ¶ a n since higher values of a imply “ thinner ” tails . We note that n * is independent of the lower bound shift parameter , x 0 ( and therefore of the mean ) of the distribution . This is due to the fact that the benefit from extra experiments comes from incremental , relative improvements rather than absolute outcomes . The n * th experiment has an expected marginal benefit exactly equal to the cost of that experiment , c . As the cost per experiment , c , declines , profit increases , [ ] 0 * * < - = n c E n ¶ p ¶ , consistent with ( 3 ) . As c declines , the optimal number of prototypes increases , 0 * < ¶ ¶ c n . Deriving the objective function as in ( 4 ) with the option to abandon yields : ( 12 ) [ ] (cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) - - - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) + = - - - - - - - G G (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) a a a a a a a a p b x b x n n bn e x nc bn x E optn 0 1 0 1 0 , 1 1 0 . Thus , the option to abandon is only relevant when the lower bound in the Frechet distribution is negative ( 0 0 < x ) . Given that n prototypes are built , and subtracting 16 ( 10 ) from ( 12 ) , the value of the option to abandon is (cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) - - - - - - - - G (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) a a a a a b x b x n n bn e x 0 1 0 , 1 0 , which can be interpreted as follows . The expression is the probability weighted loss that would be avoided when the option to abandon would be exercised . In particular , as the downside risk increases ( i . e . , as 0 x becomes more negative and losses more likely ) , both terms of the option value increase . 2 . 4 . 2 . Weibull Distribution For the Weibull distribution , equation ( 1 ) becomes ( 13 ) [ ] n c dx e b x x b x n E x b x x n (cid:215) - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - (cid:215) = (cid:242) ¥ (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - - - - 0 0 1 0 a a a p , which is maximized when ( 14 ) 1 1 * + œßø ŒºØ (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) = + G a a a a a c b n . Since [ ] 0 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 < (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - = ¶ ¶ + + G + - a a a a a a p bn n E n , ] [ n E p is strictly concave and n * is globally optimal . Again we note that scaling b and c by a constant leaves n * unchanged and that n * is independent of the upper bound of the distribution , x 0 , since in the no option case the decision on n compares relative , incremental improvements in expected outcomes to the marginal cost of those improvements . As the cost per experiment , c , declines , the optimal number of prototypes increases , 0 * < ¶ ¶ c n and , once again , [ ] 0 * * < - = n c E n ¶ p ¶ , consistent with ( 3 ) . Deriving the objective function with the option to abandon as in ( 4 ) yields : 17 ( 15 ) [ ] (cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) + - - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - = + - + G G - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - a a a a a a a a p b x b x n n bn e x nc bn x E optn 0 1 0 1 0 , 1 1 0 . First , we note that the Weibull distribution is only relevant when the upper bound is positive , that is , when 0 0 > x , since otherwise profits would not be possible and no experimentation would take place . Given that n prototypes are built , and subtracting ( 13 ) from ( 15 ) , the value is (cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) + - + - G - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) a a a a a b x b x n n bn e x 0 1 0 , 1 0 , which is the probability weighted loss that would be avoided when the option to abandon is exercised . In particular , as the upper bound of the Weibull , 0 x , decreases towards zero , both terms of the option value increase . 2 . 4 . 3 . Gumbel Distribution Employing the Gumbel ’ s closure under maximization , the expected maximum profit from n draws is given by ( 16 ) [ ] cn b n b a E n - + + = g p ln . Since [ ] 0 2 2 2 < - = n b n E n ¶ p ¶ , ] [ n E p is strictly concave and n * is a global maximum . The first order condition leads to the remarkably simple expression ( 17 ) c b n = * . Equation ( 17 ) again reveals that the optimal number of prototypes is independent of the mean of the underlying profit distribution since the shift parameter a does not appear in the expression . Rather , the result depends only on the ratio between the profit scale and the cost per experiment . This simple result is intuitively appealing in 18 that both declining prototyping costs and greater profit uncertainty increase prototyping activity . As the cost per experiment , c , declines , the optimal number of prototypes increases , 0 * 2 < - = c b c n ¶ ¶ . As c declines , profit increases , [ ] 0 * < - = c b c E n ¶ p ¶ , consistent with ( 3 ) . Deriving the objective function as before , but retaining the option to abandon the project if even the best of n prototypes generates a loss , yields : ( 18 ) [ ] œßø ŒºØ (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - (cid:215) - + - + + = b a optn ne b cn b n b a E Ei ln g p , where Ei ( y ) is the exponential integral function , (cid:242) ¥ - - = - y y dy y e y ) ( Ei . Given that n prototypes are built , the value of the option to abandon is œßø ŒºØ (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - (cid:215) - b a ne b Ei , which can be interpreted as follows . For negative values of y , - Ei ( y ) is always positive and decreases in y . Thus , as b a ne increases , œßø ŒºØ (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - (cid:215) - b a ne b Ei stays positive , but decreases in magnitude . Indeed , the option to abandon has the greatest value when only a few experiments are run ( low n ) , when uncertainty is very high ( high b ) , or when mean profit is low ( low a ) . When many experiments are run ( high n ) , and high profits ( high a ) are relatively certain ( low b ) , the option value approaches zero , as one might expect . The comparative statics results when the option to abandon exists fit our intuition . As profit variability , b , increases , so does the optimal number of prototypes , since the possibility of at least one very high outcome increases and we must remember that only the highest outcome matters . As a , the shift parameter of the distribution , is increased , the optimal number of prototypes increases . The reason is that when a increases , 19 downside costs are less likely , so the option value œßø ŒºØ (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - (cid:215) - b a ne b Ei decreases . In the no option case , upward or downward shifts in the distribution ( i . e . , changes to a ) have no effect on n * . Figure 4 depicts expected profits for Frechet , Gumbel and Weibull profit distributions which have been normalized to zero mean and unit variance . The two cases of experimentation costs 001 . 0 = c and 1 . 0 = c are depicted as the tail shape parameter , a , increases towards infinity .

Thus , the optimal number of parallel prototypes and the expected profits resulting from building them also converge as a increases . For lower values of a , however , the three distributions diverge greatly in their profit implications and in their optimal number of experiments , particularly when experimentation costs are low . Holding mean and variance constant , 20 lower a values imply fatter tails in the case of the Frechet distribution and tighter upper bounds in the Weibull case . Thus , the upper - tail - shape of the profit distribution , as parameterized by a , plays a pivotal role in determining the optimal experimentation policy and the expected profit that results from following that policy . 2 . 5 . Total Prototyping Spending as Unit Prototyping Costs Decline How do declining prototyping costs affect total spending for firms conducting experiments in parallel ? Figure 5 : Total Prototype Expenditures as Prototype Costs Decrease In the Frechet case , reducing the unit prototyping cost increases optimal total prototyping expenditures , ( ) 0 * < · c c n ¶ ¶ when 1 > a 2 , in a convex fashion , i . e . ( ) 0 * 2 2 > · c c n ¶ ¶ . In other words , the firm ’ s demand for prototyping is elastic when profits follow a Frechet distribution . Thus , when profits are highly uncertain on the upside , the firm should exploit lower - cost prototyping technologies by increasing not only the 2 R ecall 1 > a is the case of interest for the Frechet since it is required for the mean to remain finite . FrechetGumbelWeibull Spending ( n * x c ) c Decreasing Prototype Costs 21 number of parallel experiments , but also the total amount spent on those experiments . This behavior contrasts with total expenditures for the Weibull and Gumbel profit distributions as depicted in Figure 5 . In the Weibull case , the induced demand for prototyping is inelastic as declining unit prototyping costs concavely reduce optimal total expenditures , that is , ( ) 0 * > · c c n ¶ ¶ and ( ) 0 * 2 2 < · c c n ¶ ¶ . Intuitively , since Weibull - regime firms are constrained in their upside profit potential , the marginal benefits of additional experiments are small , hence total spending declines as prototyping costs drop . In the Gumbel case , reducing the unit prototyping cost has no effect on total spending , ( ( ) 0 * = · c c n ¶ ¶ ) , since total spending stays constant at b , the scale parameter of the distribution . Thus , the induced demand for prototyping has unit elasticity in the Gumbel case . To the extent that the Gumbel distribution captures the underlying profit behavior of many product development efforts , the unit elasticity result explains the relative stability of total prototyping spending as a percentage of firm profits even in the context of rapidly declining unit prototyping costs . We can quantify the opportunity cost of sub - optimal spending by evaluating the constrained optimization problem : (cid:254)(cid:253)(cid:252) (cid:238)(cid:237)(cid:236) (cid:215) - (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:242) ¥ ¥ - - n c dx x f x F x n n n ) ( ) ] ( [ max 1 subject to M n c £ (cid:215) , where M is the prototyping budget constraint .

For example , equation ( 17 ) gives total optimal spending for the Gumbel case as b c n = · * . When the budget is an amount 22 b M < , so that only * n c M < prototypes can be built , the shadow price on an extra prototyping dollar takes the simple form 1 - = M b Gumbel l . When b M ‡ , the constraint does not bind , but when b M < , it is optimal to “ rent ” additional prototyping resources . Similar analyses for the Frechet and Weibull distributions lead to 1 1 1 - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - = - G aa a a a l M c c b Frechet and 1 1 1 - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:215) (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) + = + G aa a a a l M c c b Weibull , respectively .

Hybrid Parallel / Sequential Policies Hybrid Parallel / Sequential Policies While most firms are organized to take advantage of pure sequential or pure parallel prototyping , but not both , some “ ambidextrous ” firms may be able to conduct a hybrid sequential / parallel policy . Such firms conduct smaller parallel efforts , observe the best outcome from each effort , and iterate until a good enough result is observed . By balancing the relationship between cost , expected profit and the need for speed - to - market , ambidextrous firms can globally optimize their net expected profit . In this section we relax the constraint that all prototypes must be built in a single period . We assume an infinite time horizon with discount factor d per period , 1 0 £ < d ( periods are measured relative to the end of period one ) . Any number of i . i . d . prototyping experiments can be run in each period . We show that for sufficiently low d , the optimal policy can be characterized as a hybrid sequential / parallel policy in which m * parallel prototypes are built in each period until a “ good enough ” result is achieved . 23 If d is sufficiently close to 1 , that is if delays to market are not very costly , then a pure sequential policy will be optimal . We conclude by comparing the expected profits of the optimal pure parallel , pure sequential , and hybrid policies . 3 . 1 . Purely Sequential Experimentation As a basis for comparison against pure parallel and hybrid parallel / sequential processes , we use the result in Weitzman [ 1979 ] for the optimal pure sequential search policy , referred to as Pandora ’ s rule since it consists of opening one box at a time ( building a single prototype ) with unpredictable contents ( observing a stochastic outcome ) . Each possible prototype is parameterized by the cost of building it and the probability distribution of possible rewards . A reservation price , z , is assigned to each experiment and is the solution to the following equation : ( 19 ) (cid:242) (cid:242) ¥ - ¥ (cid:215) (cid:215) + (cid:215) + - = z z dx x f z dx x f x c z ) ( ) ( d , which can also be written as : ( 20 ) ) ( ) 1 ( ) ( ) ( z F z dx x f z x c z (cid:215) (cid:215) - + - = (cid:242) ¥ d , where c is the cost of the prototype , F ( x ) the density function of the profit distribution , and d the discount factor per period . Equation ( 19 ) reveals that the reservation price equals the net expected value of running sequential experiments until realizing the first outcome greater than or equal to the reservation price . That is , z is the expected value of following a sequential experimentation policy in which the cutoff value for stopping is z itself . From equation ( 20 ) we see that z increases monotonically in d ( intuitively , if future dollars are worth more , then the cutoff for stopping should be higher since we are more willing to wait for the reward ) and decreases monotonically in c . 24 Weitzman proves that the optimal pure sequential search policy is to open the box with the highest reservation price , observe the stochastic outcome , and stop if the outcome is higher than the reservation prices for all remaining boxes . When replacement is permitted , for example when an unlimited number of the same box may be opened , Weitzman ’ s optimal policy suggests opening just one type of box , the one with the highest reservation price , until exceeding that reservation price . When delay is of no consequence , 1 = d and there is no economic advantage to building prototypes in parallel . The optimal policy is then purely sequential with one prototype built at a time order according to Weitzman ’ s Pandora ’ s rule . Figure 6 illustrates the benefits of pure sequential experimentation when there is no discounting . Figure 6 Effect of tail shape a on Profit of Sequential vs . Parallel Assuming no Discounting ( d = 1 ) and c = 0 . 1 or 0 . 001 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % 120 % 140 % Low < - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - a - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - > High Profit Improvement from Sequential relative to Parallel Weibull , high c Gumbel , low c Gumbel , high c Weibull , low c Frechet , low c Frechet , high c Frechet and Weibull converge to Gumbel In general , higher prototyping costs are seen to enhance the relative profit advantage of sequential experimentation for all distributions since parallel experimentation grows too costly . Fatter tails in the Frechet distribution ( lower a ’ s ) also favor sequential experimentation as the firm sets ever higher expectations for what level of profit performance is “ good enough . ” 25 When discounting exists , as would be the case when time - to - market is relevant , the relative profit improvement due to sequential experimentation declines with the discount factor . In fact , with a discount factor at or below 0 . 9 per period , the profit improvements depicted in Figure 6 disappear in all but the most extreme cases ( e . g . 1 . 0 > c and 2 < a ) . For 1 < d , the following proposition shows that there exists a discount factor , Switch d , for which the expected value of following a pure parallel policy actually exceeds that of following a pure sequential policy . Proposition Proposition 11 : Given experiment cost c and profit distribution ) ( x F , let ) ( d z solve equation ( 20 ) . Let ] [ * n E p be the expected value of following the optimal pure parallel policy , given c and ) ( x F . Assume ] [ ] [ 1 * p p E E n > , the expected profit from a one - shot policy . Then there exists Switch d such that : ( 1 ) ] [ ) ( * n E z Switch p d = , ( 2 ) ] [ ) ( * n E z p d < for Switch d d < , and ( 3 ) ] [ ) ( * n E z p d > for Switch d d > . Proof : When 0 = d , ] [ ] [ ) 0 ( * 1 n E E z p p < = , since rewards from future periods are completely discounted . When 1 = d , ] [ ) 1 ( * n E z p ‡ since , when there is no discounting , running * n or fewer sequential experiments is at least as good as running * n at the same time . Equation ( 20 ) gives us that ) ( d z increases monotonically in d and since 1 0 £ £ d , this completes the proof . 3 . 2 . Optimal hybrid Policy Next we consider a hybrid parallel / sequential policy in an infinite - horizon setting . In order to determine the optimal hybrid policy , we note that m i . i . d . parallel experiments can be viewed as a single , composite experiment with prototyping cost c m (cid:215) , distribution function [ ] m m x F x F ) ( ) ( = , and density [ ] 1 ) ( ) ( ) ( - (cid:215) (cid:215) = m m x F x f m x f . Thus , the hybrid problem becomes a special case of the optimal pure sequential problem , where 26 the choice of the number of parallel experiments within a period is recast as a choice from alternative experiments , parameterized by m . The corresponding reservation price , m z , solves ( 21 ) m m m m z m m z F z dx x F x f m x c m z ) ] ( [ ) ] ( [ ) ( 1 (cid:215) (cid:215) + (cid:215) (cid:215) (cid:215) + (cid:215) - = (cid:242) ¥ - d . By maximizing m , we obtain the optimal composite experiment ( consisting of m * parallel prototypes ) with the highest net expected value . Since the experiment with the highest reservation price , * m z , should be run first , it follows that the optimal hybrid policy in the infinite horizon problem is to run m * experiments in parallel in each period until a result greater than * m z is observed . The expected profits resulting from the optimal hybrid policy is * m z , which can be compared with the expected profits from pure sequential and pure parallel policies as depicted in Figure 7 . Figure 7 : Comparative Performance as a function of d 0 1 d ( Per period discount factor ) E [ p * ] Expected Profit Pure Parallel Pure Sequential Hybrid Parallel / Sequential d switch One - shot Profit In fact , as Proposition 2 shows , it is clear that the optimal hybrid policy strictly dominates either pure parallel policy over an interior range of discount factors d . 27 Proposition Proposition 22 : Given experiment cost c and profit distribution ) ( x F , let ) ( * d m z , the expected value of following the optimal hybrid policy , solve equation ( 21 ) . Let ) ( d z , the expected value of following a pure sequential policy , solve equation ( 20 ) . Finally , let ] [ * n E p , the expected value of following the optimal pure parallel policy , maximize equation ( 1 ) and exceed the expected value of a one - shot policy . Then there exists a range ) , ( High Low d d such that ( ) ] [ ) , ( max ) ( * * n m E z z p d d > for all ) , ( High Low d d d ˛ . Further , ) , ( High Low Switch d d d ˛ .

When 0 = d , rewards from future periods are completely discounted so * * n m = and ] [ ) 0 ( * * n m E z p = , since the problem reduces to a single - period optimization . When 1 = d , ) 1 ( ) 1 ( * z z m = and 1 * = m since only individual , sequential experiments will be run when there is no discounting . Equation ( 20 ) gives us that ) ( d z and ) ( * d m z both increase monotonically in d ( letting ) ( ) ( * x F x F m = and c m c (cid:215) = * in case of ) ( * d m z ) .

Likewise , over the range ] 1 , [ Switch d d ˛ , both ) ( * d m z and ) ( d z monotonically increase until they are equal at 1 = d , but ) ( * d m z starts out at a higher value , so the proposition holds over the range ) 1 , [ Switch d for some ) 1 , ( Switch High d d ˛ . This completes the proof . The optimal hybrid parallel / sequential cutoff values for Frechet , Weibull and Gumbel distributed prototyping experiments depend on d , the discount factor per period , in that lower values of d reduce the present value of profits from later design iterations in a sequential prototyping mode . Heavy discounting for time - to - market delays makes parallel prototyping a more attractive choice . Applying ( 19 ) to the cases of Frechet , Weibull and Gumbel distributed profit , but with F ( x ) replaced by the distribution 28 function [ ] m m x F x F ) ( ) ( = , the cutoff values for the optimal hybrid policies satisfy the following equations : ( 22 ) Hybrid Frechet : œœßø ŒŒºØ (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) G - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) G (cid:215) + - + (cid:215) + (cid:215) - = - - - - (cid:215) - - (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - a a a a a a d b x z m HF b x z m b x z m HF HF m b e x e z c m z HF HF 0 , 1 1 1 1 1 0 ) 1 ( 0 0 ( 23 ) Hybrid Weibull : œ œ ß ø Œ Œ º Ø (cid:247) (cid:247) ł (cid:246) (cid:231) (cid:231) Ł (cid:230) (cid:247)(cid:247) ł (cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231) Ł (cid:230) G - (cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)Ł(cid:230) G (cid:215) - - + (cid:215) + (cid:215) - = - + + (cid:215) - (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - a a a a a a d b z x m HW b z x m b z x m HW HW m b e x e z c m z HW HW 0 1 0 , 1 1 1 1 ) 1 ( 0 0 ( 24 ) Hybrid Gumbel : ( ) ) Ei ( ln 1 (cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - - (cid:215) - (cid:215) - + (cid:215) + + (cid:215) (cid:215) - - (cid:215) - = (cid:247)(cid:247)(cid:247)ł(cid:246) (cid:231)(cid:231)(cid:231)Ł(cid:230) - - (cid:215) b a z m HG HG HG b a HG e m b m b b a e z c m z z e g d Equations ( 22 ) - ( 24 ) do not have closed - form solutions , but are useful in deriving comparative statics results and can be solved numerically for the optimal policy . For example , it becomes clear that lowering the cost per prototype , c , increases the reservation price z , while lowering d , the per period discount factor , reduces z and increases m * , the optimal number of experiments per cycle . We can compare the performance of the optimal hybrid policy to that of either pure policy . Numeric results showing relative profit performance under the three distributions , all with zero mean and unit variance , are presented in Figure 8 for the case of low ( 001 . 0 = c ) and high ( 1 . 0 = c ) experimentation costs . A period - to - period discount factor of 9 . 0 = d is assumed , a period being defined as the time needed to complete one round of experimentation . 29 Figure 8 Effect of Tail - Shape on the Incremental Benefit of Hybrid d = 0 . 9 , c = 0 . 1 or 0 . 001 0 % 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % Low < - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | a | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - > High Profit Improvement from Hybrid vs . max ( Seq , Parallel ) Gumbel high c Gumbel and Weibull , low c Frechet low c Weibull , high c Frechet , high c These results indicate that while the optimal hybrid policy dominates either pure policy as shown in Proposition 2 , its incremental impact on expected profit only exceeds 15 % when experimentation is costly or the profit distribution has a fat tail . Otherwise , when discounting is minimal and / or experiments costly , the pure sequential policy will perform almost as well as the hybrid . And when discounting is heavy and / or experimentation costs low , the pure parallel policy will perform as well as the hybrid . 4 . 4 . Concluding Remarks Concluding Remarks This paper investigates optimal policies of parallel and sequential prototyping from economic and probabilistic perspectives and quantifies the tradeoffs between development speed , development cost , and profit performance . Time - to - market pressures , parameterized by a discount factor d , are shown to favor parallel over sequential prototyping when d is less than a unique cutoff discount factor , d switch . Thus , the trends towards shorter product development cycles and accelerating 30 industry clockspeeds ( Mendelson and Pillai ( 1998 ) ) favor parallel prototyping . We specify the optimal hybrid policy that dominates the profit performance of both pure policies by combining the speed advantage of parallelism with the development cost advantage of sequentialism . Our model utilizes the statistical theory of extreme values to calculate optimal parallel prototyping policies . We demonstrate the Gumbel distribution ' s central role in characterizing profit uncertainty for product concepts that are selected as the best of many ideas considered . Our analysis leads to the remarkably simple result that for Gumbel - distributed profits , the optimal number of parallel prototypes is c b n = * , where b is the scale parameter for the distribution and c is the cost per prototype . Thus , the optimal number of prototypes depends only on the ratio between the profit distribution ' s scale parameter and the cost per prototype . Parallel prototyping policies under the other extreme value distributions , i . e . those for which the tail - shape parameter a is small , are also shown to depend on c b . However , expected profit under low - a regimes , even with the same mean and variance , diverges significantly from that under a Gumbel ( infinite - a ) regime . When a is negative , but small , the upside is bounded and both expected profits and optimal number of parallel experiments are dramatically lower . Conversely , when a is positive , but small , profits are fat - tailed and the expected profit and number of parallel experiments are dramatically higher . Thus , we show that the upper tail - shape of the profit distribution drives the number of parallel prototypes and the extent to which they are expected to pay off . 31 The effect of lower unit prototyping costs on total prototyping spending also depends on the profit distribution tail - shape parameter , a . Development costs remain stable when profits are Gumbel - distributed , with reductions in unit prototyping costs being exactly offset by an increased number of prototypes . But declining unit prototyping costs under a bounded profit distribution lead to reductions in total development spending ; the firm “ takes the money and runs ” . In contrast , declining unit prototyping costs under a fat - tailed profit distribution lead to increases in total development spending . In short , parallel prototyping gains importance when : ( a ) time - to - market pressures increase ( d declines ) , ( b ) upside profits are less certain ( i . e . , are distributed with fatter upper tails ) , or ( c ) experimentation costs decline . Firms seeking to maximize new product profits should : ( 1 ) encourage creativity and experimentation as a way of fattening the upper tail of the profit distribution , ( 2 ) invest in cost efficient prototyping technologies to lower unit experimentation costs , and ( 3 ) remember that “ time is money ” when setting R & D capacities and budgets . The firm may be able to enhance its profit distribution by supporting a culture of creativity , involving outside idea suppliers , and encouraging experimentation even if it ultimately leads to failure . Having design teams compete may also improve the profit distribution , but members of the losing team will require proper incentives to “ fail forward ” ( Leonard - Barton 1995 ) . Intel , for example , holds a big party to honor the “ losers ” . Competition between design teams may improve results , speed up the design process , and create incentives to perform . Where internal competition might cause strife or where prototyping resources are limited , external suppliers can be hired to build and test multiple prototypes . 32 The trend towards lower unit prototype costs is fueled by investment in technologies such as virtual design , rapid prototyping , combinatorial methods and automated processing . Lower unit costs may also derive from economies of scale inherent in parallel prototyping itself , since some costs may be fixed . Combinatorial chemists can automatically test the performance of one hundred compounds on a test substrate just as they can ten . And consumers can respond to multiple designs on a web page as easily as they can to one , without significantly impacting the cost of market testing . Recent work by Dahan and Srinivasan ( 1998 ) demonstrates that virtual prototypes on the Web result in market share predictions that are nearly identical to those for costlier physical prototypes . We could soon witness a period of widespread virtual parallel prototyping and market testing . Organizational structure also affects the suitability of one - shot , sequential and parallel modes of prototyping . Firms may be organized to better utilize one mode or another , but design teams that are ambidextrous , and can successfully implement hybrid policies of parallel and sequential prototyping , can gain a distinct advantage over their competitors . Parallel prototypes may be actual products . Firms engaging in mass - customization may launch multiple permutations of a product , allowing customers to express their preferences directly through purchase . After observing real demand , the firm can focus on the most profitable designs . Seiko watches , Motorola pagers , and Dell personal computers embody this product - as - prototype approach . In fact , for some of its personal computers , according to Dell Vice President Stuart Smith , Dell has had only a single shipment . In summary , the choice of prototyping mode profoundly impacts the profitability of products that the firm develops .
