1 Arch Dis Child Month 2020 Vol 0 No 0 PostScript LETTER Addendum to : Children are not COVID - 19 super spreaders : time to go back to school Since publication of our original article , 1 additional evidence has come to light providing further support for our view - point . Several high - quality studies of contact tracing ( including household transmission ) have demonstrated a significantly lower attack rate in chil - dren than adults , 2 3 including in New York state and Israel where all household members had nasopharyngeal swabs tested with rt - PCR regardless of symp - toms . Children were infected at around half the rate of adults within the same household . 4 5 A household contact study from The Netherlands using serology in addition to rt - PCR showed similar findings . 6 Suggestions that children in these studies have been protected from transmission by school closures do not appreciate that a significant proportion of community transmission occurred prior to the closing of schools , after which a large burden of transmission was within households , from which chil - dren would not be shielded . This would not affect relative household contact attack rates . Further data from Iceland 7 ( where schools for young children have remained opened ) and The Netherlands 8 have confirmed extremely low levels of child - to - child or child - to - adult trans - mission , with the majority of transmis - sion occurring between adults . A public health report from Norway found no evidence of children acting as disease reservoirs . 9 The most comprehensive seroepidemiology to date from Spain has found a significant difference in the rate of COVID - 19 infection according to age ( 1 % – 3 % of children compared with > 5 % of adults ) . 10 These findings have been replicated in sero - surveillance from Switzerland where young children were less frequently infected than adults , with similar rates of infection compared to the elderly despite children having significantly more household contacts with positive serology . 11 A pre - print study from Lombardy , Italy , also found increasing rates of sero - postivity with age . 12 A study in Ireland of 6 positive cases within a school ( 3 staff , 3 student ) resulting in over 1000 contacts led to only 2 additional cases ; both from adults , to adults outside of the school environment . 13 A contact tracing study in schools from Singapore found very limited spread amongst children . 14 An additional pre - print study from primary schools in a high incidence area in France demonstrated sero - positive pupils were most likely to be infected in the home , and there was no evidence of spread within the schools . 15 It should be noted an equivalent study in a high school setting from the same area found very high levels of positivity among pupils aged 14 years and above , 16 highlighting the need for increased vigilance and infection prevention measures in teen - agers compared to younger children . Schools cannot remain closed indefi - nitely , and there is very little controversy among child health professionals of the collateral damage being done to chil - dren ( particularly those most vulnerable ) as a result of the lockdown . 17 Schools will not reopen as they were prior to the pandemic , but the community must work collaboratively and across stake - holders and agencies to achieve a ‘new normal’ , which includes risk mitigation balanced against potential harms to our children and young people . As suggested by the WHO , countries’ implementa - tion of comprehensive track and trace systems is fundamental to ensuring that school reopening does not pose a threat to wider community transmis - sion of SARS - CoV - 2 . Young people and their parents are technologically adept and provide an ideal cohort for use of phone / app - based solutions to transmis - sion monitoring . Unlike workplaces , schools provide a highly regulated envi - ronment which is well suited to investi - gation of potential disease exposure . On the other hand , institutions and national guidelines should be cautious about instituting overly aggressive or inva - sive social distancing measures within schools , which could be psychologically isolating or harmful to young children , and may not be required given the much smaller risk children pose in transmission compared with adults . Some transmission within schools of SARS - CoV - 2 is inevitable . However , unlike adult workplaces , transportation or leisure activities , the risks of severe illness or widespread transmission are greatly reduced , and the potential for rapid control of an outbreak is much better . Early signs from European coun - tries where children have been allowed back to school appear promising , but detailed monitoring of school and wider societal transmission must continue for the foreseeable future to ensure outbreaks remain local and well contained .
