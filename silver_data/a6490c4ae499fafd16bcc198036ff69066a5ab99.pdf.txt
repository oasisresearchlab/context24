Cell Biol . 2019 Vol . 218 No . 4 1138 – 1147 The actin cytoskeleton generates forces on membranes for a wide range of cellular and subcellular morphogenic events , from cell migration to cytokinesis and membrane trafficking . For each of these processes , filamentous actin ( F - actin ) interacts with membranes and exerts force through its assembly , its associated myosin motors , or both . These two modes of force generation are well studied in isolation , but how they are coordinated in cells is mysterious . During clathrin - mediated endocytosis , F - actin assembly initiated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and several proteins that compose the WASP / myosin complex generates the force necessary to deform the plasma membrane into a pit . Here we present evidence that type I myosin is the key membrane anchor for endocytic actin assembly factors in budding yeast . By mooring actin assembly factors to the plasma membrane , this myosin organizes endocytic actin networks and couples actin - generated forces to the plasma membrane to drive invagination and scission . Through this unexpected mechanism , myosin facilitates force generation independent of its motor activity . Type I myosins anchor actin assembly to the plasma membrane during clathrin - mediated endocytosis Ross T . A . Pedersen  and David G . Drubin  Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a highly conserved cel - lular process for internalizing soluble and membrane - associated cargos into nascent vesicles derived from the plasma membrane ( PM ) . During the final stages of CME , the PM is bent into a deep pit that constricts at its neck and then undergoes scission . Clath - rin and associated adaptor proteins are able to deform the PM when it is under low tension ; however , force from the actin cyto - skeleton is needed to bend the PM when it is under high tension in mammalian cells ( Batchelder and Yarar , 2010 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) or pressed against a cell wall by turgor pressure in fungal cells ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ) . Growing ev - idence indicates that actin assembly usually occurs during the final stages of CME , even in situations where F - actin is not re - quired ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . Assembly of an Arp2 / 3 complex – derived actin network at en - docytic sites generates force for PM deformation during CME , but experiments in live cells indicate that type I myosins are also required for force generation ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . In the actin assembly – based force generation model , new monomers join endocytic actin networks near the PM , pushing F - actin in the network deeper into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . F - actin is attached to the apex of endocytic pits by adaptor proteins , so this inward movement of the actin network drags the tip of the growing membrane in - vagination inward and facilitates transition from a U - shaped pit to an omega - shaped pit ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) . Reconstitution experiments indicate that growth of endo - cytic actin networks is sufficient to generate force : beads coated with the endocytic Arp2 / 3 complex activator from Saccharomy - ces cerevisiae , the Wiscott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) homologue Las17 , assemble actin tails and are motile in budding yeast cytoplasmic lysates or in the presence of actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and capping protein ( Michelot et al . , 2010 ) . However , budding yeast cells harboring mutations in the genes encoding type I myosins assemble robust endocytic actin networks but fail to internalize vesicles by CME ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . These data demonstrate that both actin assembly and type I myosin activity are required for CME in vivo . The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated at the base of endocytic sites ( near the PM ) by nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) . In budding yeast , the principal NPFs , Las17 and the type I myosins Myo5 and Myo3 , exist in a complex termed the WASP / myosin complex that stays at the base of the endocytic site while the coat internalizes ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . This complex also in - cludes the homologues of WASP interacting protein ( Vrp1 ) and the F - BAR protein Toca - 1 ( Bzz1 ) along with the NPF regulator Bbc1 ( Soulard et al . , 2002 ) . Previously , we distilled this complex down to a single engineered Myo5 - Las17 fusion protein with non - essential domains deleted to reveal the minimal activities of the WASP / myosin complex required to build an actin cytoskeleton © 2019 Pedersen and Drubin This article is distributed under the terms of an Attribution – Noncommercial – Share Alike – No Mirror Sites license for the first six months after the publication date ( see http : / / www . rupress . org / terms / ) .

Our fusion protein revealed that the following domains are sufficient to support CME even in the absence of all other members of the WASP / myosin com - plex : ( a ) a domain for recruitment to endocytic sites , ( b ) an NPF domain to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , ( c ) a functional myosin motor domain , and ( d ) a membrane binding domain from Myo5 ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . However , the mechanistic contributions of the activities provided by Myo5 in our minimal fusion pro - tein were unclear . To determine the mechanistic contributions of membrane binding by Myo5 during CME , we engineered budding yeast strains lacking membrane - bound Myo5 . Our results reveal that Myo5 serves as the key membrane anchor for the actin assembly factors of the WASP / myosin complex . Results and discussion To investigate how type I myosin membrane binding contributes to CME , we made S . cerevisiae strains with MYO5 genes encoding mutant proteins linked to a C - terminal 13Myc tag for immuno - blotting to ensure that the mutant alleles were expressed ( Fig . S1 A ) . We examined CME phenotypes using live - cell imaging of Sla1 - GFP as a marker for the endocytic coat and Abp1 - mRFP as a marker for endocytic actin networks . Because Myo3 and Myo5 are redundant under laboratory conditions ( Goodson et al . , 1996 ) , we used a background with the MYO3 gene deleted throughout our study . When we deleted MYO5 completely or replaced it with a mutant lacking the membrane - binding Tail homology 1 ( TH1 ) domain ( Feeser et al . , 2010 ; Fernández - Golbano et al . , 2014 ) , CME was severely defective . While F - actin still assembled at endo - cytic sites , the sites turned over slowly and became depolarized ( Fig . 1 A ) , puncta of Sla1 - GFP failed to move off of the PM ( Fig . 1 , B and C ; and Video 1 ) , and lifetimes of Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - mRFP at endocytic sites were extended in comparison to wild - type MYO5 cells ( Fig . S1 B ) . Surprisingly , rather than being restricted to en - docytic sites , endocytic actin networks marked by Abp1 - mRFP frequently formed motile comets deep in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1 , A and D ; and Video 1 ; Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . These observations sug - gest that actin assembly can become uncoupled from endocytic sites in mutants lacking membrane - bound Myo5 . All observed mutant cells lacking membrane - bound Myo5 had negligible rates of endocytic vesicle internalization ( Fig . 1 C ) , but not all cells had cytoplasmic actin comets in epifluorescence vid - eos ( Fig . 1 D ) . To resolve this discrepancy , we imaged our mutants lacking membrane - binding competent Myo5 using total inter - nal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIR FM ) , reasoning that actin comets could be an exaggerated manifestation of a more penetrant actin assembly phenotype occurring close to the PM . In wild - type MYO5 cells , TIR FM videos revealed discrete actin assembly events at each Sla1 - GFP – marked endocytic site after 16 ± 4 s ( n = 60 sites , mean ± SD ) , even in situations where multiple sites were clustered together . In myo5Δ and myo5 - TH1Δ cells , however , actin assembly initiated at individual endocytic sites after 20 ± 7 s ( n = 85 and 50 sites , P = 0 . 0001 and 0 . 0022 , respec - tively , compared with MYO5 by one - way ANO VA [ F = 9 . 509 ] fol - lowed by Dunnett’s test ) and then spread as a wave in the plane of the PM , frequently engulfing neighboring endocytic sites ( Fig . 1 , Figure 1 .

This phenomenon was evident in every cell examined ; thus , delocalized actin assembly is a fully penetrant phenotype . Together , these data indicate that Myo5 restricts actin assembly to endocytic sites . The Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin assembly during CME , so aberrant actin assembly in myo5 mutants suggests that membrane binding by Myo5 may restrict actin assembly to endocytic sites through localizing Arp2 / 3 complex activity . To determine whether the Arp2 / 3 complex becomes mislocalized in myo5 mutants deficient in membrane - binding , we visual - ized the complex by creating an in - frame GFP fusion of ARC15 , which encodes the S . cerevisiae homologue of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex subunit ARPC5 , at its endogenous genomic locus . In wild - type MYO5 cells , the Arp2 / 3 complex localized exclusively to Abp1 - mRFP patches at the cell cortex , but in myo5Δ cells or cells expressing the myo5 - TH1Δ membrane - binding mutant , 99 ± 2 % ( myo5Δ ) and 100 % ( myo5 - TH1Δ ) of cytoplasmic Abp1 - mRFP - labeled actin comets colocalized with the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Fig . 2 A and Video 3 ) . To test whether the mislocalized Arp2 / 3 complex was active , we treated cells with CK - 666 , a re - versible small molecule inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) , or with an equivalent control concentration of DMSO ( Fig . S1 , E and F ) . Addition of CK - 666 to cells contain - ing cytoplasmic actin comets caused rapid dissolution of the cytoplasmic actin structures ( Fig . 2 B ) and drastically reduced the percentage of cells with visible comets ( Fig . 2 C ) . These results show that Myo5 constrains Arp2 / 3 complex activity to endocytic sites . The observed mislocalization of active Arp2 / 3 complex sug - gested that membrane binding by Myo5 retains Arp2 / 3 complex activators ( NPFs ) at endocytic sites . The S . cerevisiae genome encodes four NPFs . The primary NPF activities are contained within the WASP / myosin complex and comprise ( a ) Las17 and ( b ) Vrp1 working in cooperation with Myo3 or Myo5 . These fac - tors remain at the base of CME sites during membrane invag - ination ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . Abp1 and the budding yeast intersectin homologue Pan1 have also been re - ported to have NPF activity , but these activities are not essential for CME ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Goode et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . To test whether the WASP / myosin complex is restricted to endo - cytic sites by Myo5 , we localized each member of the complex by epifluorescence microscopy . While all members of the WASP / myosin complex ( Las17 , Vrp1 , Bbc1 , and Bzz1 ) localized to cortical CME sites in wild - type MYO5 cells , they were found at the tips of the cytoplasmic actin comets in myo5 - TH1Δ cells . Conversely , Pan1 localized exclusively to the cell cortex in both wild - type MYO5 and myo5 - TH1Δ cells ( Fig . 2 D and Videos 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ) . The myo5 - TH1Δ protein itself similarly localized to the tips of the cytoplasmic actin comets ( Fig . S1 G and Video 9 ; Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . The relocalization of the WASP / myosin complex in the absence of membrane binding by Myo5 indicates that Myo5 restricts actin assembly to endocytic sites by constraining the location of Arp2 / 3 complex activation . Membrane binding by Myo5 could be important for re - stricting Arp2 / 3 complex activation to sites of CME by phys - ically linking the WASP / myosin complex to the PM at CME sites , by preventing continued WASP / myosin complex activity after vesicle internalization , or by preventing aggregation of WASP / myosin complex proteins in the cytoplasm . Knowing the origin of actin comets in myo5 mutants would help to distin - guish between these models . We suspected that actin comets represented actin internalized from endocytic sites without coincident vesicle internalization for several reasons . First , we repeatedly observed comets that appeared to pull away from the PM in epifluorescence videos ( Fig . 3 A and Video 3 ) . Second , actin waves originated at CME sites in TIR FM videos ( Figs . 1 E and S1 C and Video 2 ) . Finally , Sla1 - GFP – labeled patches failed to move off the PM in Myo5 mutants ( Fig . 1 C ) , making it unlikely that the actin comets represented internalized vesicles that failed to disassemble the WASP / myosin complex . Pulse - chase experiments with the membrane dye FM4 - 64 supported this conclusion by revealing that myo5 mutants internalized very small amounts of dye ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . While the trace amount of dye internalized in myo5 mutants is similar to the amount internalized in CME - defective sla2Δ cells ( Peng et al . , 2015 ) , we cannot exclude the possibility that small amounts of membrane internalize in these mutants . Because actin comets appear to originate at the PM in myo5 mutants , and these same mutants fail to internalize membrane by CME , we conclude that Myo5 plays the role of anchoring the WASP / myosin complex to the PM at endocytic sites . To directly visualize the role of Myo5 as a membrane anchor for the WASP / myosin complex , we performed CK - 666 washout ex - periments . We pretreated cells with CK - 666 to synchronize CME events , stalling them at the stage before actin assembly . We then added media to dilute the CK - 666 below its effective concentra - tion and observed growth of endocytic actin networks by epiflu - orescence microscopy . In wild - type MYO5 cells , actin assembly after CK - 666 washout coincided with internalization of Sla1 - GFP patches ( Fig . 3 D ; Fig . S2 , A and B ; and Video 10 ) . In mutant cells deficient for membrane - bound Myo5 , actin still assembled at en - docytic sites after CK - 666 washout , but Sla1 - GFP patches failed to move off the PM . Sla1 - GFP signal decreased coincident with actin assembly , likely reflecting recruitment of endocytic disassembly factors by F - actin ( Toret et al . , 2008 ) . Strikingly , flares of Abp1 - mRFP signal were frequently observed to separate from endocytic sites and internalize ( Fig . 3 D ; Fig . S2 , A and B ; and Video 10 ) . These flares moved off the PM with an average velocity of 240 ± 80 nm / s , similar to the reported speed of Abp1 patches after ves - icle scission in wild - type cells of 230 nm / s ( Fig . S2 C ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . A one - sample t test comparing the measured actin flare velocities to the known value of 230 nm / s yielded a P value of 0 . 55 , supporting the hypothesis that these two actin structures move similarly . These data strongly suggest that the observed flares represent actin internalization uncoupled from mem - brane internalization .

When we performed CK - 666 washout experiments on cells expressing the WASP / myosin complex protein Vrp1 - GFP , we once again observed actin flares peeling off the PM ( Fig . 3 E and Video 11 ) . However , unlike Sla1 - GFP , which remained on the PM ( Fig . 3 D ) , Vrp1 - GFP puncta occasionally splintered perceptibly , with a subset of the protein internalizing with the Abp1 - mRFP – Figure 2 .

This behavior contrasts starkly with the behavior of Vrp1 puncta in wild - type MYO5 cells , which re - main on the PM during CME ( Fig . 3 E ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Thus Myo5 membrane binding is crucial for coupling actin assembly to vesicle internalization through anchorage of the WASP / myosin complex to the PM at endocytic sites . Thus far , we have revealed a novel function for Myo5 in an - choring actin assembly to the PM during CME . While we have Figure 3 . Myo5 couples the assembling actin network to the PM during CME .

Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810005 Pedersen and Drubin Myosin anchors actin assembly to membranes 1143 observed uncoupling of actin assembly from endocytic sites upon deletion of the membrane - binding domain of Myo5 , we have not identified the other end of this crucial linkage : how Myo5 con - tacts actin assembly factors to anchor them . To elucidate this end of the Myo5 membrane - actin linkage , we scored cytoplas - mic actin comet formation in strains harboring a series of myo5 alleles encoding domain - deleted versions of the protein , each linked to a C - terminal 13Myc tag for immunoblotting to ensure that the mutant alleles were expressed ( Figs . 4 A and S3 A ) . While deletion of the membrane - binding TH1 domain caused formation of actin comets , no other individual domain truncation elicited this phenotype ( Fig . 1 D ; Fig . 4 , B and C ; and Video 12 ; Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . Because Myo5 motor activity itself is crucial for CME ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Idrissi et al . , 2012 ; Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) , we reasoned that Myo5 may be redundantly linked to the actin cy - toskeleton through binding of its motor domain to F - actin and one of its other domains to actin assembly factors in the WASP / myosin complex . To identify these domains , we made myo5 alleles encoding proteins with pairwise deletions , combining motor domain deletion with deletion of the F - actin – binding TH2 domain ( Geli et al . , 2000 ) , the poly - proline domain - binding Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , and the Arp2 / 3 complex - binding Connector / acidic ( CA ) domain . Both myo5 - motorΔ TH2Δ and myo5 - motorΔ SH3Δ cells contained cytoplasmic actin comets ( Fig . 4 , B and D ; and Video 13 ) , indicating that Myo5 is linked to the endocytic actin cytoskeleton through both its motor domain and domains in the nonmotor tail of the protein . Myo5 is normally recruited to endocytic sites and bound into the WASP / myosin complex by its SH3 domain , with possible con - tributions from the TH2 domain ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; MacQuarrie et al . , 2018 Preprint ) . Because the entire WASP / myosin complex be - comes uncoupled from endocytic sites in myo5 membrane - bind - ing mutants ( Fig . 2 D ) and myo5 motor mutants unable to bind the other WASP / myosin proteins , we concluded that Myo5 exerts its actin - membrane bridging function by directly anchoring the WASP / myosin complex to the PM . To test whether Myo5 is the membrane anchor for the WASP / myosin complex , we expressed versions of each myo5 truncation that formed comets fused via a flexible peptide linker to Vrp1 , a WASP / myosin complex protein that normally binds to Myo5 . If Myo5 is the membrane anchor for the WASP / myosin complex , we reasoned that this linkage might eliminate actin comet formation in myo5 truncation mutants that fail to bind to the WASP / myosin proteins but not in mutants that fail to bind to the PM . Vrp1 linkage to myo5 - TH1Δ failed to res - cue the cytoplasmic actin comet phenotype , but the linkage did rescue comet formation for myo5 - motorΔ TH2Δ and the myo5 - motorΔ SH3Δ mutant proteins ( Fig . 4 E and Video 14 ) , supporting the conclusion that Myo5 binds to and anchors other WASP / my - osin complex components to the PM . Internalization of Sla1 - GFP patches and lifetimes of Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - mRFP patches were not rescued in these mutants , confirming the essential role of the Myo5 motor domain in CME ( Fig . S3 , B and C ) . A detailed char - acterization of the contribution of Myo5 motor activity to CME will be the subject of a future study . Nevertheless , myo5 mutants that did not exhibit comets were healthier than mutants that did exhibit comets , as illustrated by restored growth of the cells at high temperatures , indicating that cytoplasmic actin comets represent a bona fide pathology on the cellular level ( Fig . 4 F ) . Our data demonstrate that Myo5 anchors assembling actin net - works to the PM at endocytic sites redundantly through its motor and tail domains ( Fig . 4 G ) . A recent study demonstrated that the WASP / myosin complex is recruited to endocytic sites as a ring around the presumptive invagination site in the plane of the PM and that this symmetri - cal organization of Arp2 / 3 complex activators results in optimal force generation by actin assembly ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) . Our re - sults indicate that Myo5 anchors Arp2 / 3 complex activators to CME sites , most likely through direct membrane binding , and that this linkage is crucial for maintaining their ordered localiza - tion . This organization restricts actin nucleation to discrete areas on the PM , resulting in an ordered actin network that can gener - ate force ( Fig . 5 A ; Mund et al . , 2018 ) . Absent membrane anchor - ing , Arp2 / 3 complex activation and subsequent actin nucleation can occur throughout the actin network , leading to disordered networks that fail to generate force to bend the membrane and , in the most catastrophic circumstances , pull away from the mem - brane completely ( Fig . 5 B ) . This model differs from a previous interpretation where we proposed that Myo5 links actin fila - ments themselves to the PM at endocytic sites ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , a requirement for a membrane anchor for NPFs has also been reported in engineered motile systems , and absence of the linkage causes a qualitatively similar phenotype to what we observed , with actin tails separating from their initial substrate ( Co et al . , 2007 ) . PM - anchoring of actin assembly factors by Myo5 is a novel , conserved membrane - actin linkage at endocytic sites , adding to our understanding of the CME actin machinery . Previous stud - ies have described how endocytic coat components recruit actin assembly factors to endocytic sites ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) and how movement of F - actin into the cytoplasm is coupled to inward movement of the endocytic coat ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . Our ex - periments reveal the mechanism by which actin assembly factors are anchored to the PM during actin assembly . Interestingly , the human homologue of Myo5 , Myosin 1e , also interacts with a vari - ety of endocytic proteins through its tail domains ( Krendel et al . , 2007 ) , and mislocalization of Myosin 1e in human cells also leads to mislocalization of Arp2 / 3 complex activators ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) . These observations suggest that membrane anchoring of WASP family proteins is a conserved function of type I myosins . It is particularly intriguing that unmooring of the actin assem - bly machinery from endocytic sites results in waves of actin assem - bly that spread across the PM ( Fig . 1 , E and F ; Fig . S1 C ; and Video 2 ) . Similar waves of assembling F - actin manifest in diverse systems ranging from immune cells to oocytes and embryos ( Weiner et al . , 2007 ; Bement et al . , 2015 ; Inagaki and Katsuno , 2017 ) and are usually generated by activator - inhibitor – coupled systems , where actin assembly leads to the delayed recruitment of an inhibitor of actin assembly ( Allard and Mogilner , 2013 ) . Indeed , F - actin itself indirectly recruits disassembly factors to endocytic sites ( Toret et al . , 2008 ) , and negative feedback of F - actin on Arp2 / 3 regulators partially accounts for the transient assembly and disassembly of the actin machinery at endocytic sites ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) . Our data substantiate the existence of such feedback relationships in CME by demonstrating that spatially uncoupling the actin assembly Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810005 Pedersen and Drubin Myosin anchors actin assembly to membranes 1144 machinery ( the WASP / myosin complex ) from the endocytic dis - assembly factors ( recruited by F - actin ) results in traveling waves characteristic of activator - inhibitor – coupled systems . Type I myosins are pervasive components of actin machin - ery involved in membrane trafficking events ( Sokac et al . , 2006 ; Almeida et al . , 2011 ) . Here we have shown that anchoring the actin assembly machinery to the PM is a principal role of type I myosin during CME . It is now important to determine whether type I myosins serve a similar mechanistic role during other membrane trafficking processes . Figure 4 .

Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810005 Pedersen and Drubin Myosin anchors actin assembly to membranes 1145 Materials and methods Strains and plasmids All budding yeast strains were derived from the wild - type diploid DDY1102 and propagated using standard techniques ( Amberg et al . , 2005 ) . Mutant strains were constructed using plasmid DNA encoding URA3 - marked MYO5 variants flanked by the MYO5 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions as templates for genomic integra - tion in diploids that were MYO5 / myo5Δ : : HygMX6 . Integration of the full - length mutant allele was ensured by cross selection for acquisition of uracil prototrophy and loss of hygromycin re - sistance . C - terminal GFP fusions , C - terminal 13Myc fusions , and truncations were constructed as described previously ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . All strains were verified by PCR and immunoblotting . For growth comparisons , mid - log phase starter cultures were di - luted to an OD 600 of 0 . 1 , 0 . 02 , and 0 . 004 , spotted on plates , and grown for 48 h at 25°C and 37°C . The strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 . Plasmids used for genomic integration are listed in Table S2 . Live cell imaging Cells were grown to mid - log phase in imaging media ( synthetic minimal media supplemented with adenine , l - histidine , l - leu - cine , l - lysine , l - methionine , uracil , and 2 % glucose ) , and then adhered to coverslips coated with 0 . 2 mg / ml concanavalin A . Epifluorescence imaging was performed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with a Nikon 100× 1 . 4 - NA Plan Apo VC oil - immersion objective and an Andor Neo 5 . 5 sCMOS camera . GFP and mRFP fluorescence were excited using a Lumencore Spectra X LED light source with 550 / 515 - nm and 470 / 422 - nm excitation filters . For two - color imaging , channels were acquired sequentially using an FF - 493 / 574 - Di01 dual - pass dichroic mir - ror and FF01 - 512 / 630 - 25 dual - pass emission filters ( Semrock ) . The system was controlled with either Metamorph or Nikon El - ements software and maintained at 25 ° C by an environmental chamber ( In Vivo Scientific ) . Frames were separated by either 2 or 1 . 15 s depending on the software used . TIR FM imaging was performed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 in - verted microscope with a Nikon CFI60 60× 1 . 49 - NA Apo oil - immersion TIRF objective and a Hamamatsu Orca - Flash 4 . 0 V2 sCMOS camera . GFP and mRFP fluorescence were excited using 488 - and 561 - nm lasers and detected using a Chroma HC TIRF Quad Dichroic ( C - FL TIRF Ultra Hi S / N 405 / 488 / 561 / 638 ) and Chroma HC Quad emission filters BP 525 / 550 and BP600 / 650 , respectively . Channels were acquired sequentially . The system was controlled with Nikon Elements software and maintained at 25 ° C by an OkoLab environmental chamber . Frames were separated by 1 s . All image analysis was performed using Fiji software ( Na - tional Institutes of Health ) . For quantification of Sla1 - GFP in - ternalization and Sla1 - GFP / Abp1 - mRFP patch lifetimes , 10 radial kymographs were generated at random for each cell , measured , and judged as “internalized” if the Sla1 - GFP patch moved at least 3 pixels ( 194 nm ) toward the cell interior . The Manual Tracking Fiji plugin was used for particle tracking in Fig . S2 C . For figure panels and videos , individual cells were cropped , background fluorescence was uniformly subtracted from the image stack , and Figure 5 . Model for Myo5 function in anchoring actin assembly to the PM at endocytic sites . ( A ) Myo5 ( yellow bananas ) restricts activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( gray avocados ) by the WASP complex ( blue widgets ) to a discrete location , generating an actin array that grows predominantly in the same direction to generate force . ( B ) Absent this critical linkage , Arp2 / 3 activators splinter off of the PM , leading to Arp2 / 3 complex activation throughout the actin network . Delocalized Arp2 / 3 complex activation results in disordered actin arrays that fail to produce force . In the most catastrophic cases , the Arp2 / 3 complex and its activators pull away from the PM completely to form cytoplasmic actin comets ( lower left of zoom ) .

Lookup tables used for display are linear and cover the full range of data . Figures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator CS6 . CK - 666 experiments CK - 666 ( ≥98 % pure ) was purchased from Sigma Life Sciences , resuspended in DMSO , and used at 250 µM ( Fig . S1 E ) . All CK - 666 experiments were conducted in epifluorescence . For wash - in experiments , cells were adhered to a coverslip as described above and submerged in 500 µl imaging medium . After 10 – 20 frames of imaging , 500 µl of 500 µM CK - 666 was added to the cells . To score actin comets across a population of cells treated with CK - 666 ( Fig . 2 C ) , cells were pretreated with 250 µM CK - 666 for 10 min before imaging . For CK - 666 washout experiments , cells were adhered to coverslips and submerged in 250 µl imaging medium with 250 – 500 µM CK - 666 . After 10 – 20 frames of imaging , 4 ml of fresh imaging medium was added to the cells , diluting CK - 666 to ≤29 µM , well below the effective concentration ( Fig . S1 E ) . FM4 - 64 pulse - chase experiments Cells were immobilized on coverslips , quickly equilibrated with a single wash of imaging medium with 10 µg / ml FM4 - 64 ( Molecu - lar Probes ) , and then incubated in imaging medium with 10 µg / ml FM4 - 64 for 5 min at room temperature . Coverslips were then washed vigorously with fresh imaging medium to eliminate ex - cess FM4 - 64 . Coverslips were photographed immediately to iden - tify cells that stained brightly with FM4 - 64 at a zero time point ; these cells were interpreted to be dead or to have compromised PM permeability and were eliminated from analysis . Coverslips were then photographed a second time after a 5 - min chase . Images were collected on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted micro - scope with a Nikon 100× 1 . 45 - NA Plan Apo λ oil immersion ob - jective , an Andor IXon X3 EM - CCD camera , and an Andor CSU - X spinning disc confocal equipment . FM4 - 64 fluorescence was ex - cited using a 488 - nm laser and detected with a Chroma 605 / 52 - nm emission filter . The system was controlled with Nikon Elements software . Imaging was conducted at room temperature ( ∼ 23 ° C ) . The fraction of FM4 - 64 internalized was determined by dividing the total integrated signal of FM4 - 64 signal inside of the obvious PM by the total integrated FM4 - 64 signal of the cell . Western blotting Cells were grown to mid - log phase in rich medium ( 20 g / l bac - to - peptone , 10 g / l bacto - yeast extract , and 2 % glucose ) , har - vested by centrifugation , washed with water , and lysed by bead beating in a lysis buffer with 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 5 mM EDTA , pH 8 , and 15 % TCA . The TCA precipitate was then washed with ice - cold acetone and resuspended in Tris / urea sample buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 3 M urea , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 5 % β mercaptoethanol , and 0 . 05 % bromophenol blue ) . Extracts were separated electrophoretically on 8 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose . Membranes were blocked with 5 % milk , probed with mouse monoclonal antibody clone 9E10 against a 13 - myc tag ( prepared from hybridoma super - natant ; Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) and mouse monoclonal anti - Pgk1 ( 459250 ; Novex ) , and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to infrared fluorophores ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) . Bands were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) . Statistics and reproducibility of experiments All experimental results presented were replicated in at least three distinct experiments to ensure reproducibility . For imaging experiments , multiple cells from each replicate were analyzed . As data from different days were indistinguishable , they were pooled for statistical analysis . The specific number of cells ana - lyzed is indicated in each figure legend . Statistical analysis was conducted in Prism 7 . 0 ( Graph - Pad Software ) . Online supplemental material Fig .
