Keywords : Actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , cofilin , cortactin , tyrosine protein kinase Background : Arg / Abl2 has two actin binding domains , but how they influence actin filaments was unknown . Results : Arg and cortactin cooperatively stabilize actin filaments ; Arg enhances Arp2 / 3 complex activation and stimulates severing by cofilin . Conclusion : Arg directly regulates actin filament stability , branching and severing , which are modulated by cortactin . Significance : These activities may underlie the control of actin - based cellular structures by Arg . ABSTRACT Both Arp2 / 3 complex and the Abl2 / Arg non - receptor tyrosine kinase are essential to form and maintain diverse actin - based structures in cells , including cell - edge protrusions in fibroblasts and cancer cells and dendritic spines in neurons . The ability of Arg to promote cell edge protrusions in fibroblasts does not absolutely require kinase activity , raising the question of how Arg might modulate actin assembly and turnover in the absence of kinase function . Arg has two distinct actin - binding domains and interacts physically and functionally with cortactin , an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex . However , it was not known whether and how Arg influences actin filament stability , actin branch formation or cofilin - mediated actin severing or how cortactin influences these reactions of Arg with actin . Arg or cortactin bound to actin filaments stabilizes them from depolymerization . Low concentrations of Arg and cortactin cooperate to stabilize filaments by slowing depolymerization . Arg stimulates formation of actin filament branches by Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin . An Arg mutant lacking the C - terminal calponin homology ( CH ) actin - binding domain stimulates actin branch formation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , indicative of autoinhibition . Arg ∆ CH can stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex even in the absence of cortactin . Arg greatly potentiates cofilin severing of actin filaments , and cortactin attenuates this enhanced severing . The ability of Arg to stabilize filaments , promote branching and increase severing requires the internal I / LWEQ actin - binding domain . These activities likely underlie important roles that Arg plays in the formation , dynamics and stability of actin - based cellular structures . http : / / www . jbc . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1074 / jbc .

Cells use formins , Arp2 / 3 complex and other proteins to nucleate new filaments , which grow by elongation of their barbed ends ( 1 , 2 ) . ADF / cofilin proteins sever actin filaments , producing a new barbed end at each severing site ( 3 ) . On the other hand , extensive cofilin - mediated actin severing can lead to loss of actin filaments and disruption of branched actin networks ( 4 ) . Crosslinking proteins can organize actin filaments into bundles and other structures in cellular protrusions such as microvilli , filopodia and neuronal dendritic spines ( 5 ) . The Abl family kinases , including vertebrate Abl1 / Abl and Abl2 / Arg , are important regulators of cellular morphogenesis and migration in developing metazoans . Abl2 / Arg in particular is essential for the proper formation and stability of actin - based structures , including fibroblast cell edge protrusions , cancer cell invadopodia and dendritic spines ( 6 - 8 ) . In response to growth factor or adhesion receptor stimulation , Arg functions in part through phosphorylation of a number of substrates including key cytoskeletal regulators ( 6 ) . One important Arg substrate is cortactin , an actin - binding protein that stimulates Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate actin filament branches ( 9 - 11 ) . Cortactin also stabilizes actin filament branches ( 9 ) and inhibits actin filament severing by cofilin ( 12 , 13 ) . Abl family kinases also have kinase - independent functions . This was first noted by Hoffmann and colleagues , who found that many of the defects in cell morphogenesis in abl mutant Drosophila embryos could be rescued by a kinase - inactive Abl transgene ( 14 ) . Similarly , a kinase - inactive Arg point mutant can largely rescue the deficiencies in cell edge protrusion of Arg - knockout fibroblasts ( 15 ) . These data suggest that Abl family kinases also regulate actin - dependent processes in a kinase - independent manner , but the mechanisms by which they do so are unclear . Abl family kinases are unique in that they contain C - terminal extensions with protein : protein interaction motifs and cytoskeletal binding domains . The Arg C - terminal extension uniquely contains multiple cytoskeletal binding domains , including an internal actin - binding I / LWEQ domain , a microtubule binding domain and a C - terminal actin - binding calponin homology ( CH ) domain ( Figure 1A ) ( 16 , 17 ) . These domains allow Arg to bundle actin filaments and crosslink actin filaments and microtubules in vitro ( 16 , 17 ) . Arg binds cooperatively to actin filaments at a saturation binding density of 1 Arg : 2 actin subunits and induces a 30º twist in the actin filament ( 18 , 19 ) . Cortactin also binds actin filaments directly through its “cortactin repeat” region ( Figure 1A ) ( 10 , 20 ) . Remarkably , cortactin binds Arg - coated actin filaments at twice the density ( 1 cortactin : 2 actins ) of naked actin filaments ( 1 cortactin : 4 actins ) ( 19 ) . The capacity of Arg to recruit cortactin to polymerizing actin may be an important regulatory mechanism within cells . Consistent with this model , knocking down Arg in cultured neurons significantly reduces cortactin in dendritic spines , resulting in their destabilization ( 7 ) . Previous work demonstrated that Arg is a key regulator of sub cellular structures composed of actin filaments , but it was not known whether Arg alone or in combination with cortactin controls actin filament polymerization , depolymerization , branching by Arp2 / 3 complex or severing by cofilin . We used total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to investigate each of these reactions . We found that neither Arg nor cortactin alters actin elongation , but both slow dissociation of subunits from the barbed end of the filament . Low concentrations of Arg and cortactin cooperate to stabilize actin filaments . Arg potentiates actin filament branching by Arp2 / 3 complex with cortactin and the verprolin - connecting - acidic domain ( VCA ) of N - WASp . Arg also stimulates filament severing by cofilin in a concentration - dependent manner , but cortactin attenuates this stimulation . Together , our results illustrate that Arg directly regulates actin filament dynamics in several ways , and that cortactin modulates these activities .

Arg deletion constructs and fragments as well as cortactin 3YF and W525A mutants were generated using PCR - based mutagenesis ( 15 , 17 ) . Recombinant baculoviruses expressing these proteins were generated using the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( 21 ) . Cells were lysed in lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 , 5 % glycerol , 20 mM imidazole , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors [ benzamidine , aprotinin , leupeptin , chymostatin ] . His 6 - tagged proteins were purified on a Ni 2 + affinity column and eluted with 250 mM imidazole , followed by an SP - Sepharose ion exchange column with a 100 mM NaCl wash . Final elution buffer ( EB ) was 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA . De - P W525A was dephosphorylated as described in ( 22 ) by incubating with 1 . 0 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) ( New England Biolabs , Inc . ) for each microgram of protein for 4 hours at room temperature and was re - purified as described above ( 19 ) . Actin was purified from an acetone powder of frozen chicken breast muscle ( Trader Joe’s , Orange , CT ) by one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization ( 23 ) , followed by gel filtration in Buffer G ( 2 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM NaN 3 ) and storage in Buffer G at 4°C . Actin monomers were polymerized by dialyzing in 50 mM PIPES - Tris ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and labeled on lysines by incubating overnight at 4 ºC with a 1 : 13 molar ratio of actin to Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester ( A - 20000 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Labeled actin was then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 120 , 000 x G , depolymerized , clarified and gel - filtered on Sephacryl S - 300 resin in Buffer G . Purified Alexa 488 - monomers were typically 30 - 50 % labeled . Prior to each experiment Ca 2 + - ATP actin monomers ( 20 % Alexa 488 - labeled ) were converted to Mg 2 + - ATP actin by addition of 0 . 05 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA followed by a 5 min incubation . Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and GST - VCA were purified from thymus as previously described in Higgs et al . 1999 ( 24 ) . Human cofilin 1 was expressed in pLysS cells with 1 mM IPTG over a 4 - hour incubation period at 37 ºC . Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM EGTA and 2 mM DTT and lysed by sonication . Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21 , 200 x g for 45 min . The lysate supernatant was applied to a DEAE - Sepharose column and the flow - through was dialyzed in 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 mM DTT . The protein was then concentrated to 25 mL using a centrifuge filter device ( Corning , 10 kDa MWCO ) , gel - filtered on a 400 mL column of Sephacryl S - 200 resin , dialyzed in KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , flash - frozen and stored at - 80 ºC . Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) experiments – Open - ended glass flow chambers were prepared ( 25 - 27 ) . Prior to each reaction , the chamber was incubated for 1 min with two 8 mL washes of each of the following solutions : ( 1 ) 0 . 5 % Tween - 80 in high - salt TBS ( HS - TBS ; 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 600 mM KCl ) ; ( 2 ) 250 nM NEM - inactivated chicken skeletal muscle myosin in HS - TBS ; and ( 3 ) 10 % BSA in HS - TBS . The chamber was washed twice with HS - TBS between each incubation step , and with KMEI buffer immediately before introducing actin . Equal parts 2X microscopy buffer [ 70 mM KCl , 1 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 4 mM EGTA , 14 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 1 % ( 4000 cP ) methylcellulose , 30 mM glucose , 400 µM ATP , 100 mM DTT , 40 µ g / mL catalase , 200 µ g / mL glucose oxidase ] and EB ( see above ) were mixed and added to the actin monomers in Buffer G to induce polymerization . The resulting buffer contained 250 mM NaCl and 35 mM KCl . To compensate for the effect of salt on the affinity of cofilin for actin filaments ( 28 ) , we used 30 µ M cofilin in the severing experiments . For depolymerization , branching and severing experiments , actin was polymerized in the chamber until filaments were visible .

Arg and / or cortactin , plus 10 nM bovine Arp2 / 3 complex , 100 nM GST - VCA and 1 µ M ATP - actin monomers for branching experiments , or 30 µ M human cofilin 1 for severing experiments ) in microscopy buffer and imaging was continued . Fluorescence micrographs were collected every 5 - 10 seconds using prism - style total internal reflection microscopy on an Olympus IX - 70 inverted microscope and a Hamamatsu C4747 - 95 CCD ( Orca - ER ) camera controlled by MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices , Union City , CA ) . Changes in filament length were measured using ImageJ software for at least 10 filaments in each condition over 10 - 20 frames , which covered a span of at least 200 seconds . We assumed 370 actin subunits per µ m of filament ( 29 ) . Kinase assays Kinase reactions were performed using 50 nM Arg and 1 µM substrate ( cofilin and GST - CrkII as a control ) in 25 mM Hepes pH 7 . 25 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 5 % glycerol , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM MnCl 2 , 5 µ M ATP , 0 . 75 µ Ci γ - 32 P - ATP . Reactions were terminated at 5 , 30 , and 60 min , separated on SDS - PAGE gels and exposed to phosphorimaging screens . Co - sedimentation assays Two micromolar actin filaments were incubated with either 50 µ M cofilin or 1 µ M cortactin or both and centrifuged at 100 , 000 x g for 1 h . Pellet samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . The intensities of the cofilin and actin bands were quantified with NIH ImageJ , and the relative filament saturation by cofilin was obtained by dividing the intensity of the cofilin band by the intensity of the actin band in each lane . RESULTS Arg and cortactin inhibit actin depolymerization – We used TIRF microscopy ( TIRFM ) to extend our studies of the effects of Arg and cortactin on actin polymerization ( 19 ) by measuring rates of barbed end elongation and shortening . Arg binds actin filaments cooperatively with a K D ( apparent ) ≈ 0 . 3 µ M ( 30 ) , while cortactin binds with a K D = 0 . 4 µ M ( 31 ) . Neither protein significantly affected elongation of Mg - ATP - actin ( 20 % labeled with Alexa 488 ) at concentrations up to 1 . 5 µ M ( Figure 1C ) . We confirmed our previous observation that 1 µ M Arg slows depolymerization of actin filaments ~ 6 - fold ( Figure 1E ) . At 1 µ M , Arg saturates ~ 91 % of the binding sites on the actin filaments . Experiments with deletion mutants ( Figure 1A , B ) showed that inhibition of depolymerization by 1 µ M Arg depends much more on the internal Arg I / LWEQ actin - binding site than the C - terminal CH domain ( Table 1 ) . Thus the ability of the CH domain to change the twist in the actin filament ( 32 ) is not required to slow depolymerization . The Arg paralog Abl and cortactin also slowed depolymerization ( Table 1 ) . Neither Arg nor cortactin inhibited depolymerization effectively at concentrations below their K D ’s , so high densities of either protein on filaments are required to slow depolymerization ( Figure 1E , Table 1 ) . The binding densities are only about 50 % saturation with 0 . 3 µ M Arg and 27 % saturation with 0 . 15 µ M cortactin , where neither alone inhibited depolymerization ( Figure 1D ) . Although neither Arg nor cortactin inhibited depolymerization at low concentrations , a combination of 0 . 3 µ M Arg plus 0 . 15 µ M cortactin slowed depolymerization to the same extent as 1 µ M of either protein ( Figure 1D , E , Table 1 ) . On the other hand , combining 0 . 15 µ M cortactin with 0 . 3 µ M Abl did not slow depolymerization ( Figure 1D , Table 1 ) . Experiments with Arg deletion mutants demonstrated that recruitment of cortactin by the Arg CH domain is not necessary , but can be sufficient for synergism between Arg and cortactin under some conditions . First , even though Arg Δ CH does not recruit cortactin to actin filaments ( 19 ) , 0 . 3 µ M Arg Δ CH allowed 0 . 15 µ M cortactin to slow barbed end depolymerization ( Table 1 ) . Second , 1 µ M Arg ∆ I / LWEQ promotes cortactin binding to filaments ( 19 ) , but did not slow polymerization by itself . Yet 0 . 3 µ M Arg ∆ I / LWEQ synergized with 0 . 15 µ M cortactin to slow a t UN I V E R S I T Y O F M E M P H I S on M a r c h 23 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Abl2 / Arg and cortactin regulate actin filament behavior 5 depolymerization ( Table 1 ) . These observations suggest that loading filaments with cortactin by the Arg CH domain can compensate for the loss of the I / LWEQ domain in protecting filaments from depolymerization . We used several mutants of cortactin ( Figure 1A ) to test whether direct interaction with Arg is required to stabilize actin filaments . First , a point mutation in the cortactin SH3 domain ( W525A ) disrupted binding to the Arg PYLPRLP motif , which is required for Arg to phosphorylate several tyrosines in cortactin ( 15 , 19 ) . Second , replacement of the phosphorylatable tyrosine residues Y421 , Y466 and Y482 with phenylalanine in the 3YF mutant prevented phosphorylation and subsequent Arg SH2 domain binding ( 33 ) . Third , we treated W525A with calf intestinal phosphatase , which we have previously shown to remove all tyrosine phosphorylation , to produce dephosphorylated ( De - P ) - W525A ( 19 ) . All three cortactin variants have wild type affinity for actin filaments ( 33 ) . Published experiments with these mutated proteins showed that these reciprocal interactions between Arg and cortactin contribute to cell - edge protrusion in motile cells and stabilize dendritic spines of neurons ( 7 , 15 , 34 ) . Like wild type cortactin , 1 µ M cortactin mutants slowed depolymerization of actin filaments and 0 . 15 µ M of the variants in combination with 0 . 3 µ M Arg also slowed depolymerization ( Table 2 ) . Thus , neither of the defined Arg : cortactin binding interfaces is required for cooperative filament stabilization . Effects of Arg on branch formation by Arp2 / 3 complex – Cortactin weakly activates branch formation by Arp2 / 3 complex on its own , but robustly stimulates branch formation when combined with the nucleation - promoting factor N - WASp ( 9 , 35 - 37 ) . We confirmed that 1 µ M cortactin increased branching by Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASp GST - VCA ~ 3 - fold ( Figure 2A , B ) ( 38 ) . Arg alone did not affect the rate of branch formation at any concentration tested , but combining 1 µ M Arg with 0 . 15 µ M or 1 µ M cortactin increased the rate of branch formation above that observed for either concentration of cortactin alone ( Figure 2A , C ) . This stimulation depended on the presence of the internal I / LWEQ actin - binding domain of Arg ( Figure 2D ) . Cortactin mutants bearing disruptions of either or both interactions with Arg showed synergistic activation of branching with 1 µM Arg . The magnitude of this effect was reduced for the 3YF and W525A mutants , but not for the de - P - W525A ( Figure 2B , C ) . Surprisingly , Arg lacking the CH domain promoted branching by Arp2 / 3 complex even in the absence of cortactin , provided that GST - VCA was present . Thus , the CH domain seems to autoinhibit the ability of full - length Arg to enhance the nucleation promoting activity of GST - VCA . A sub - saturating concentration of Arg Δ C H also strongly stimulated branching , indicating that this mechanism does not require saturated actin binding by Arg ( Figure 2E ) . The presence of 1 µ M GST - tagged Arg CH domain partially inhibits the ability of Arg ∆ CH to stimulate actin branch formation ( Figure 2E ) . Arg promotes severing by cofilin , but cortactin inhibits this activity – We used TIRF microscopy to measure filament severing by cofilin ( 39 ) ( Figure 3 ) . For these assays , we had to balance the insolubility of Arg at low salt concentrations ( 21 ) with the salt - sensitivity of cofilin binding to actin filaments ( 40 ) . As a compromise we used a high cofilin concentration , 30 µ M , to obtain binding and severing in the higher salt buffer . The rate of severing by cofilin increased with the concentration of Arg up to the highest concentration tested ( Figure 3A , B ) . Arg does not phosphorylate cofilin ( Figure 3C ) , indicating that activation of severing does not involve phosphorylation . Arg Δ I / LWEQ did not stimulate severing , while Arg Δ CH stimulated cofilin severing similar to wild type Arg ( Figure 3E ) . Thus , the previously observed ability of the Arg CH domain to alter actin filament twist ( 18 ) and recruit cortactin ( 19 ) is not part of the severing mechanism . On the other hand , cortactin had a biphasic effect on actin filament severing by cofilin : 1 µ M cortactin inhibited severing ( 13 ) , but higher concentrations had no effect ( Figure 3A , B ) . Cofilin binds actin filaments in the presence of 1 µ M cortactin ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that cortactin inhibits severing by a t UN I V E R S I T Y O F M E M P H I S on M a r c h 23 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Abl2 / Arg and cortactin regulate actin filament behavior 6 affecting the filament structure or flexibility . However , cortactin reduces the extent of filament saturation by cofilin by ~ 20 % , suggesting that higher concentrations of cortactin may compete with cofilin for binding and therefore promote severing . Arg , Arg Δ CH and Arg Δ I / LWEQ each overcame the inhibition of severing by 1 µ M cortactin and restored the severing rate to that observed for cofilin alone ( Figure 3E ) . In contrast , mutants of cortactin disrupting one or both Arg interaction interfaces inhibited cofilin severing both in the presence and absence of Arg , suggesting that Arg - mediated phosphorylation , and possibly binding , of cortactin is required to overcome the inhibition of severing by cortactin . DISCUSSION The Abl2 / Arg non - receptor tyrosine kinase is an important regulator of actin - driven cellular processes in a variety of cellular contexts ( 15 ) . Abl family kinases use both kinase - dependent and kinase - independent mechanisms to regulate the formation of actin - based cellular structures . Previous work described how Arg phosphorylates discrete cytoskeletal regulatory proteins to control changes in cell structure and function ( 8 , 11 , 15 - 17 , 41 - 45 ) . Here we report that Arg and its binding partner cortactin interact directly with actin filaments to affect their stability , branch formation and severing . Arg alone has no effect on actin filament elongation but can stabilize actin filaments . Low concentrations of Arg can cooperate with cortactin to stabilize actin filaments and this ability does not require the defined Arg : cortactin binding interfaces . Arg increases actin filament branching by cortactin and Arp2 / 3 complex . An Arg mutant lacking its CH domain potently stimulates branching by Arp2 / 3 complex and GST - VCA . Arg and cortactin have opposite effects on actin filament severing by cofilin ; Arg promotes and cortactin inhibits severing . Together , they can cancel each other’s effects on severing by interacting directly . In the absence of Arg : cortactin interactions , the severing rate is similar to that observed in the presence of wild - type cortactin alone . Arg does not phosphorylate actin , Arp2 / 3 complex ( 46 ) or cofilin ( Figure 3C ) . Together , these findings strongly suggest that the effects of Arg on actin filament stability and branching do not require Arg kinase activity . The concentrations of Arg and cortactin in cells are high enough to make the reactions described here physiologically relevant . For example , Arg is present at 0 . 4 - 0 . 6 µ M in dendritic spines and cortactin concentrations may be as high as 4 µ M within breast cancer cell invadopodia ( 12 , 30 , 41 ) . Dendritic spines in Arg - deficient neurons exhibit a loss of cortactin , reduced actin content , morphological changes and loss of stability both in culture and in vivo ( 7 , 47 ) . The cooperative binding of Arg and cortactin to actin filaments that we have described may help to concentrate Arg and cortactin binding to individual subsets of actin filaments ( 17 - 19 ) at levels sufficient to influence filament stability , branching and severing in key subcellular compartments . Interestingly , the Arg C - terminal domain alone ( residues 557 - 1182 ) , which lacks the kinase domain , nearly completely rescues the defects in cell edge protrusion of Arg knockout fibroblasts ( 16 ) . Our results are consistent with this observation and support our model that Arg and cortactin can regulate actin by a mechanism independent of phosphorylation . Individually , Arg or cortactin bound to the filament slow the dissociation of actin subunits from barbed ends . This is likely to be a direct effect on the dissociating subunit rather than a change in filament conformation induced by the CH domain of Arg , since Arg without the CH domain has the same activity . Rather , the internal I / LWEQ domain mediates Arg’s stabilization activity . Neither Arg nor cortactin influence association of actin monomers , another indication that they do not alter the conformation of the filament end . During polymerization , actin monomer binding is likely to stay ahead of the binding of Arg and cortactin near the barbed end , whereas direct interactions between Arg / cortactin bound near the barbed end are more likely during depolymerization . This mechanism would explain the selective effects of Arg and cortactin on actin filament depolymerization . Although Abl stabilizes actin filaments on its own , it does not cooperate with cortactin like Arg . Arg differs from Abl in having an internal I / LWEQ actin - binding domain , but this a t UN I V E R S I T Y O F M E M P H I S on M a r c h 23 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Abl2 / Arg and cortactin regulate actin filament behavior 7 domain does not account for their differences . Arg ∆ I / LWEQ , which lacks this domain , does not itself stabilize filaments , yet it cooperates with cortactin to stabilize actin filaments . Without this domain Abl alone can stabilize actin filaments , even though it cannot cooperate with cortactin . Cortactin stimulates GST - VCA - mediated activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by binding branch junctions and facilitating GST - VCA release ( 38 ) . We observed that Arg further increases Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin branching induced by cortactin and GST - VCA . Cortactin has a higher affinity for branch junctions than the sides of naked filaments ( 38 ) . We propose that Arg enhances these interactions of cortactin with Arp2 / 3 complex at branch junctions either directly or indirectly , explaining how Arg cooperates with cortactin at both low and high saturation densities of Arg . Arg does not increase Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin branching by GST - VCA alone unless the CH domain is deleted . The CH domain is likely to autoinhibit the nucleation promoting activity of Arg , since GST - CH domain inhibits actin filament branching by Arg Δ CH . Since this activity depends on the I / LWEQ domain , the CH domain may mask the ability of the I / LWEQ domain to stimulate branching or interfere with Arp2 / 3 complex binding to actin filaments . Similar to cofilin , the CH domain induces a twist in the actin filament , which may alter or impair the binding of the I / LWEQ domain or Arp2 / 3 complex ( 18 ) . Cofilin severs actin filaments optimally when a low density of cofilin is bound along the filament , whereas filaments saturated with cofilin are stable ( 28 ) . The I / LWEQ domain is required for Arg to promote severing by cofilin ( Figure 3A , C ) . The simplest explanation is that Arg competes with cofilin for binding filaments , keeping the density of bound cofilin low . However , the mechanism is likely to be more complicated , given that we did not observe lower rates of severing at Arg concentrations ( 2 - 3 µ M ) that saturate > 97 % of binding sites on the filaments . Low concentrations of cortactin inhibit actin filament severing by cofilin ( Figure 3A , B ) , likely by changing the filament conformation ( 48 ) . Higher concentrations of cortactin have less effect on severing , perhaps by competing with cofilin for binding to the filament ( Figure 3D ) , so these competing effects balance out . Arg with or without the I / LWEQ and CH domains can overcome the inhibition of severing by cortactin ( Figure 3E ) . Cortactin binding to cofilin inhibits cofilin severing of actin filaments ( 12 , 13 ) . We observe a similar effect , but with significantly higher concentrations of cofilin than cortactin suggesting an alternate mechanism , possibly mediated through structural changes to the actin filament . Arg and cortactin do not compete for binding to filaments and Arg actually increases this interaction between cortactin and actin ( 19 ) . It is possible that Arg - induced alterations in the mode of cortactin binding to filaments affect cortactin’s ability to inhibit severing . Arg and cortactin act together to mediate the formation , function and stability of breast cancer cell invadopodia , fibroblast membrane ruffles and cell edge protrusions and neuronal dendritic spines ( 8 , 16 , 42 , 47 , 49 ) , processes that depend on actin filament networks . We present multiple mechanisms by which Arg stabilizes filaments in a cooperative manner with its substrate , cortactin , and promotes actin nucleation through increased branching and severing . In combination , we expect these mechanisms to promote actin filament polymerization and stability . These activities may underlie the dependence of these diverse actin - based structures on Arg and cortactin . REFERENCES 1 . Pollard , T . D . , and Borisy , G . G .
